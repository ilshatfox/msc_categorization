that every not necessarily linear nor continuous 2 local triple derivation on a von neumann algebra m is a triple deriva tion equivalently the set dert m of all triple derivations on m is algebraically 2 reflexive in the set m m mm of all mappings from m into m 1 introduction let x and y be banach spaces according to the terminology employed in the literature see for example 4 a subset d of the banach space b x y of all bounded linear operators from x into y is called alge braically reflexive in b x y when it satisfies the property 1 1 t b x y with t x d x x x t d algebraic reflexivity of d in the space l x y of all linear mappings from x into y a stronger version of the above property not requiring continuity of t is defined by 1 2 t l x y with t x d x x x t d in 1990 kadison proved that 1 1 holds if d is the set der m x of all associative derivations on a von neumann algebra m into a dual m bimodule x 18 johnson extended kadison s result by establishing that the set d der a x of all associative derivations from a c algebra a into a banach a bimodule x satisfies 1 2 17 algebraic reflexivity of the set of local triple derivations on a c algebra and on a jb

continuity of t in 6 bres ar and s emrl proved that the set of all algebra automor phisms of b h is algebraically reflexive whenever h is a separable infinite dimensional hilbert space given a banach space x a linear mapping t x x satisfying the hypothesis at 1 2 for d aut x the set of automorphisms on x is called a local automorphism larson and sourour showed in 22 that for every infinite

witness a grow ing interest in a subtle version of algebraic reflexivity called algebraic 2 reflexivity cf 1 2 10 11 21 23 25 26 and 29 a subset d of the set m x y y x of all mappings from x into y is called algebraically 2 reflexive when the following property holds for each mapping t inm x y such that for each a b x there exists s sa b d depending on a and b with t a sa b a and t b sa b b then t

actually the set hom a of all homomorphisms on a general c algebra a is al gebraically 2 reflexive in the banach algebra b a of all bounded linear operators on a and the set hom a of all homomorphisms on a is algebraically 2 reflexive in the space l a of all linear operators on a cf 27 in recent contributions burgos ferna ndez polo and the third author of this note prove that the set hom m respectively homt m of all homomorphisms respectively triple homomorphisms on a von neumann algebra respectively on a jbw triple m is an algebraically 2 reflexive subset of m m cf 10 11 respectively while ayupov and the first author of this note establish that set der m of all derivations on m is algebraically 2 reflexive in m m see 2 2 local triple derivations 3 in this paper we consider the set dert a of all triple derivations on a c algebra a we recall that every c algebra a can be equipped with a ternary product of the form a b c 1 2 ab c cb a when a is equipped with this product it becomes a jb triple in the sense of 19 a linear mapping a a is said to be a triple derivation when it satisfies the triple leibnitz rule a b c a b c a b c a b c it is known that every triple derivation is automatically continuous cf 3 we refer to 3 15 and 28 for the basic references on triple derivations according to the standard notation 2 local dert a mappings from a into a are called 2 local triple derivations the goal of this note is to explore the algebraic 2 reflexivity of dert a in m a our main result proves that every not necessarily linear nor continuous 2 local triple derivation on an arbitrary von neumann algebra m is a triple derivation hence linear and continuous see theorem 2 14 equivalently dert m is algebraically 2 reflexive in m m 2 2 local triple derivations on von neumann algebras we start by recalling some generalities on triple derivations let a be a c algebra for each b a we shall denote bymb the jordan multiplication mapping by the element b that is mb x b x 1 2 bx xb following standard notation given elements a b in a we denote by l a b the operator on a defined by l a b x a b x 1 2 ab x xb a it is known that he mapping a b a a given by a b x l a b x l b a x is a triple derivation on a cf 3 15 called an inner triple derivation let a a be a triple derivation on a unital c algebra by 15 lemmas 1 and 2 1 1 and m 1 1 2 1 1 is an inner triple derivation on a and the difference d 1 2 1 1 is a jordan derivation on a more concretely d x y d x y x d y and d x d x for every x y a by 3 corollary 2 2 and hence d is a continuous operator a widely known result due to b e johnson states that every bounded jordan derivation from a c algebra a to a banach a bimodule is an associative derivation cf 16 therefore d is an associative derivation in the usual sense when a m is a von neumann algebra we can guarantee that d is an inner derivation that is there exists a a satisfying d x a x a x xa for every x a cf 30 theorem 4 1 6 further from the condition d x d x for every x a we 4 kudaybergenov oikhberg peralta and russo deduce that a a x x a a thus taking a 1 2 a a it follows that a x a x for every x m we have therefore shown that for every triple derivation on a von neumann algebram there exist skew hermitian elements a b m satisfying x a x b x for every x m our first lemma is a direct consequence of the above arguments see 15 lemmas 1 and 2 lemma 2 1 let t a a be a not necessarily linear nor continuous 2 local triple derivation on a unital c algebra then a t 1 t 1 b mt 1 1 2 t 1 1 is an inner triple derivation on a c t t 1 2 t 1 1 is a 2 local triple derivation on a with t 1 0 in what follows we denote by asa the hermitian elements of the c algebra a lemma 2 2 let t a a be a not necessarily linear nor continuous 2 local triple derivation on a unital c algebra satisfying t 1 0 then t x t x for all x asa proof let x asa by assumptions t x 1 t x 1 1 x 1 x 1 x 1 1 x 1 2 x 1 1 x 1 x 1 x 2 t 1 x 1 x 1 x t x the proof is complete lemma 2 3 let t m m be a not necessarily linear nor continuous 2 local triple derivation on a von neumann algebra satisfying t 1 0 then for every x y msa there exists a skew hermitian element ax y m such that t x ax y x and t y ax y y proof for every x y msa we can find skew hermitian elements ax y bx y m such that t x ax y x bx y x and t y ax y y bx y y taking into account that t x t x see lemma 2 2 we obtain ax y x bx y x t x t x ax y x bx y x x a x y x b x y x ax y x bx y ax y x bx y x i e bx y x 0 and similarly bx y y 0 therefore t x ax y x t y ax y y and the proof is complete we state now an observation which plays an useful role in our study 2 local triple derivations 5 lemma 2 4 let a and b be skew hermitian elements in a c algebra a suppose x a is self adjoint with ax xa bx xb 0 then ax xa and bx xb proof since 0 ax xa bx xb passing to the adjoint we obtain ax xa bx xb 0 conclude the proof by adding and subtracting these two equalities the proof is complete let m be a von neumann algebra if x msa we denote by s x the support projection of x that is the projection onto ker x ran x we say that x has full support if s x 1 equivalently ker x 0 lemma 2 5 let m be a von neumann algebra suppose u m has full support c m is self adjoint and c 2 u 0 then c 0 consequently if u and c are as above and uc cu 0 or c 2 u cuc 0 then c 0 proof for the fist statement of the lemma suppose c 2 u 0 note that 0 c 2 u 0 c cu cuc however cuc is positive hence cuc 0 cuc with max cuc cuc thus cu 1 2 u 1 2 c cuc 0 which means that cu 1 2 u 1 2 c 0 and hence s c 1 u 1 2 1 s u 0 which leads to c 0 to prove the second part we have c 2 u cuc 0 hence in particular c 2 u 0 the proof is complete in 2 lemma 2 2 ayupov and the first author of this note prove that for every not necessarily linear nor continuous 2 local derivation on a von neumann algebra m m and every self adjoint element z m there exists a m satisfying x a x for every x w z wherew z z denotes the abelian von neumann subalgebra of m generated by the element z and the unit element and z denotes the bicommutant of the set z we prove next a ternary version of this result lemma 2 6 let t m m be a not necessarily linear nor continuous 2 local triple derivation on a von neumann algebra let z m be a self adjoint element and let w z z be the abelian von neumann subalgebra of m generated by the element z and the unit element then there exist skew hermitian elements az bz m depending on z such that t x az x bz x azx xaz 1 2 bzx xbz for all x w z in particular t is linear on w z 6 kudaybergenov oikhberg peralta and russo proof we can assume that z 6 0 note that the abelian von neumann subalgebras generated by 1 and z and by 1 and 1 z 2 z coincide so replacing z with 1 z 2 z we can assume that z is an invertible positive element by definition there exist skew hermitian elements az bz m depending on z such that t z az z bz z define a mapping t 0 m m given by t 0 x t x az z bz z x m clearly t 0 is a 2 local triple derivation on m we shall show that t 0 0 on w z let x w z be an arbitrary element by assumptions there exist skew hermitian elements cz x dz x m such that t 0 z cz x z dz x z and t 0 x cz x x dz x x since 0 t 0 z cz x z dz x z we get cz x z dz x z 0 taking into account that z is a hermitian element and lemma 2 4 we get cz xz zcz x and dz xz zdz x since z has a full support and d 2 z xz dz xzdz x lemma 2 5 implies that dz x 0 further cz x z z w z i e cz x commutes with any element in w z therefore t 0 x cz x x dz x x 0 for all x w z the proof is complete 2 1 complete additivity of 2 local derivations and 2 local triple derivations on von neumann algebras let p m denote the lattice of projections in a von neumann algebra m let x be a banach space a mapping p m x is said to be finitely additive when n i 1 pi n i 1 pi for every family p 1 pn of mutually orthogonal projections in m a map ping p m x is said to be bounded when the set p p p m is bounded the celebrated bunce wright mackey gleason theorem 7 8 states that if m has no summand of type i 2 then every bounded finitely additive map ping p m x extends to a bounded linear operator from m to x 2 local triple derivations 7 according to the terminology employed in 32 and 13 a completely additive mapping p m c is called a charge the dorofeev sherstnev theorem 32 theorem 29 5 or 13 theorem 2 states that any charge on a von neumann algebra with no summands of type in is bounded we shall use the dorofeev shertsnev theorem in corollary 2 8 in order to be able to apply the bunce wright mackey gleason theorem in proposi tion 2 9 to this end we need proposition 2 7 which is implicitly applied in 2 proof of lemma 2 3 for 2 local associative derivations a proof is included here for completeness reasons first we recall some facts about the strong topology for each normal positive functional in the predual of a von neumann algebra m the mapping x 7 x xx x x 2 1 2 x m defines a prehilbertian seminorm on m the strong topology of m is the locally convex topology on m defined by all the seminorms where runs in the set of all positive functionals in m cf 30 definition 1 8 7 it is known that the strong topology of m is compatible with the duality m m that is a functional m c is strong continuous if and only if it is weak continuous see 30 corollary 1 8 10 we also recall that the product of every von neumann algebra is jointly strong continuous on bounded sets see 30 proposition 1 8 12 suppose x w is another von neumann algebra and let denote the norm the weak or the strong topology of w the mapping is said to be completely additive respectively countably or sequentially additive when 2 1 i i ei i i ei for every family respectively sequence ei i i of mutually orthogonal pro jections in m it is known that every family pi i i of mutually orthogonal projections in a von neumann algebra m is summable with respect to the weak topology of m and p weak i i pi is a projection in m cf 30 definition 1 13 4 further for each normal positive functional in m and every finite set f i we have p i f pi 2 p i f pi which implies that the family pi i i is summable with respect to the strong topology of m with the same limit that is p strong i i pi 8 kudaybergenov oikhberg peralta and russo proposition 2 7 let t m m be a not necessarily linear nor continu ous 2 local triple derivation on a von neumann algebra then the following statements hold a the restriction t p m is sequentially strong additive and consequently sequentially weak additive b t p m is weak completely additive i e 2 2 t weak i i pi weak i i t pi for every family pi i i of mutually orthogonal projections in m proof a let pn n n be a sequence of mutually orthogonal projections in m let us consider the element z n i 1 npn by lemma 2 6 there exist skew hermitian elements az bz m such that t x az x bz x for all x w z since n 1 pn pm w z for all m n and the product of m is jointly strong continuous we obtain that t n 1 pn az n 1 pn bz n 1 pn n 1 az pn n 1 bz pn n 1 t pn i e t p m is a countably or sequentially strong additive mapping b let be a positive normal functional in m and let denote the prehilbertian seminorm given by z 2 1 2 zz z z z m let pi i i be an arbitrary family of mutually orthogonal projections in m for every n n define in i i t pi 1 n we claim that in is a finite set for every natural n otherwise passing to a subset if necessary we can assume that there exists a natural k such that ik is infinite and countable in this case the series i ik t pi does not converge with respect to the semi norm on the other hand since ik is a countable set by a we have t i ik pi strong i ik t pi which is impossible this proves the claim we have shown that the set i 0 i i t pi 6 0 n n in 2 local triple derivations 9 is a countable set and t pi 0 for every i i i 0 set p i i i 0 pi m we shall show that t p 0 let q denote the support projection of in m having in mind that t pi 2 0 for every i i i 0 we deduce that t pi q for every i i i 0 replacing t with t t 1 2 t 1 1 we can assume that t 1 0 cf lemma 2 1 and t x t x for every x msa cf lemma 2 2 by lemma 2 3 for every i i i 0 there exists a skew hermitian element ai ap pi m such that t p aip pai and t pi aipi piai since t pi q we get aipi piai q q aipi piai 0 for all i i i 0 thus since paipiq piaiq t p pi q aip pai piq aipiq paipiq aipiq piaiq aipi piai q 0 and similarly q pit p 0 for every i i i 0 consequently 2 3 t p p q t p i i i 0 pi q 0 q i i i 0 pi t p q pt p therefore t p p 1 p p 1 p p p 2 p 1 p p

applications of a give t i i pi t p i i 0 pi t p t i i 0 pi 10 kudaybergenov oikhberg peralta and russo t p t i i 0 pi i i 0 t pi by the cauchy schwarz inequality 0 t pi 2 t pi 2 0 for every i i i 0 and hence i i 0 t pi i i t pi the arbitrariness of shows that t weak i i pi weak i i t pi let be a normal functional in the predual of a von neumann algebra m our previous proposition 2 7 assures that for every not necessarily linear nor continuous 2 local triple derivation t m m the mapping t p m p m c is a completely additive mapping or a charge on m under the additional hypothesis of m being a continuous von neumann algebra or more generally a von neumann algebra with no type in factors 1 n direct summands i e without direct summand isomorphic to a matrix algebra mn c 1 n the dorofeev sherstnev theorem 32 theorem 29 5 or 13 theorem 2 imply that t p m is a bounded charge that is the set t p p p m is bounded the uniform boundedness principle gives corollary 2 8 let m be a von neumann algebra with no type in factor direct summands 1 n and let t m m be a not necessarily linear nor continuous 2 local triple derivation then the restriction t p m is a bounded weak completely additive mapping 2 2 additivity of 2 local triple derivations on hermitian parts of von neumann algebras suppose now that m is a von neumann algebra with no type in factor direct summands 1 n and t m m is a not necessarily linear nor continuous 2 local triple derivation by corollary 2 8 combined with the bunce wright mackey gleason theorem 7 8 there exits a bounded linear operator g m m satisfying that g p t p for every projection p m let z be a self adjoint element in m by lemma 2 6 there exist skew hermitian elements az bz m such that t x az x bz x for every x w z since g w z t w z w z m are bounded linear operators which coincide on the set of projections of w z and every self adjoint element in w z can be approximated in norm by finite linear combinations of mutually orthogonal projections in w z it follows that t x g x for every x w z and hence t a g a for every a msa in particular t is additive on msa the above arguments materialize in the following result 2 local triple derivations 11 proposition 2 9 let t m m be a not necessarily linear nor con tinuous 2 local triple derivation on a von neumann algebra with no type in factor direct summands 1 n then the restriction t msa is additive corollary 2 10 let t m m be a not necessarily linear nor contin uous 2 local triple derivation on a properly infinite von neumann algebra then the restriction t msa is additive next we shall show that the conclusion of the above corollary is also true for a finite von neumann algebra first we show that every 2 local triple derivation on a von neumann algebra intertwines central projections lemma 2 11 if t is a not necessarily linear nor continuous 2 local triple derivation on a von neumann algebra m and p is a central projection in m then t mp mp in particular t px pt x for every x m proof consider x mp then x pxp x p p t coincides with a triple derivation x p on the set x p hence t x x p x x p x p p x p x p p x x p p p x p x p p lies in mp for the final statement fix x m and consider skew hermitian elements ax xp bx xp m satisfying t x ax xp x bx xp x and t xp ax xp xp bx xp xp the assumption p being central implies that pt x t px proposition 2 12 let t m m be a not necessarily linear nor contin uous 2 local triple derivation on a finite von neumann algebra then the restriction t msa is additive proof since m is finite there exists a faithful normal semi finite trace on m we shall consider the following two cases case 1 suppose is a finite trace replacing t with t t 1 2 t 1 1 we can assume that t 1 0 cf lemma 2 1 and t x t x for every x msa cf lemma 2 2 by lemma 2 3 for every x y msa there exists a skew hermitian element ax y m such that t x ax y x and t y ax y y then t x y xt y ax y x y x ax y y ax y xy that is ax y xy t x y xt y further 0 ax y xy t x y xt y 12 kudaybergenov oikhberg peralta and russo i e t x y xt y for every x y msa for arbitrary u v w msa set x u v and y w the above identity implies t u v w u v t w ut w vt w t u w t v w t u t v w and so t u v t u t v w 0 for all u v w msa take w t u v t u t v then ww 0 since the trace is faithful it follows that ww 0 and hence w 0 therefore t u v t u t v case 2 as in case 1 we may assume t 1 0 suppose now that is a semi finite trace since m is finite there exists a family of mutually orthogonal central projections zi in m such that zi has finite trace for all i and zi 1 cf 30 2 2 or corollary 2 4 7 by lemma 2 11 for each i t maps zim into itself from case 1 t zim zim zim is additive furthermore zit x y t zim zix ziy t zim zix t zim ziy zit x zit y for every x y m and every i therefore t x y i zi t x y i zit x y i zit x zit y i zi t x i zi t y t x t y for every x y m the proof is complete let t m m be a not necessarily linear nor continuous 2 local triple derivation on an arbitrary von neumann algebra in this case there exist orthogonal central projections z 1 z 2 m with z 1 z 2 1 such that z 1 m is a finite von neumann algebra z 2 m is a properly infinite von neumann algebra cf 30 2 2 by lemma 2 11 for each k 1 2 zkt maps zkm into itself by corol lary 2 10 and proposition 2 12 both z 1 t and z 2 t are additive on msa so t z 1 t z 2 t also is additive on msa we have thus proved the following result proposition 2 13 let t m m be a not necessarily linear nor contin uous 2 local triple derivation on an arbitrary von neumann algebra then the restriction t msa is additive 2 local triple derivations 13 2 3 main result we can state now the main result of this paper theorem 2 14 let m be an arbitrary von neumann algebra and let t m m be a not necessarily linear nor continuous 2 local triple derivation then t is a triple derivation hence linear and continuous equivalently the set dert m of all triple derivations on m is algebraically 2 reflexive in the set m m mm of all mappings from m into m we need the following two lemmata lemma 2 15 let t m m be a not necessarily linear nor continuous 2 local triple derivation on a von neumann algebra with t 1 0 then there exists a skew hermitian element a m such that t x a x for all x msa proof let x msa by lemma 2 3 there exist a skew hermitian element ax x 2 m such that t x ax x 2 x t x 2 ax x 2 x 2 thus t x 2 ax x 2 x 2 ax x 2 x x x ax x 2 x t x x xt x i e 2 4 t x 2 t x x xt x for every x msa by proposition 2 13 and lemma 2 2 t msa msa msa is a real linear mapping now we consider the linear extension t of t msa to m defined by t x 1 ix 2 t x 1 it x 2 x 1 x 2 msa taking into account the homogeneity of t proposition 2 13 and the iden tity 2 4 we obtain that t is a jordan derivation on m by 5 theorem 1 any jordan derivation on a semi prime algebra is a derivation since m is von neumann algebra t is a derivation on m see also 33 and 16 therefore there exists an element a m such that t x a x for all x m in particular t x a x for all x msa since t msa msa we can assume that a a which completes the proof lemma 2 16 let t m m be a not necessarily linear nor continuous 2 local triple derivation on a von neumann algebra if t msa 0 then t 0 proof let x m be an arbitrary element and let x x 1 ix 2 where x 1 x 2 msa since t is homogeneous if necessary passing to the element 1 x 2 1 x we can suppose that x 2 1 in this case the element y 14 kudaybergenov oikhberg peralta and russo 1 x 2 is positive and invertible take skew hermitian elements ax y bx y m such that t x ax y x bx y x t y ax y y bx y y since t y 0 we get ax y y bx y y 0 by lemma 2 4 we obtain that ax y y 0 and ibx y y 0 taking into account that ibx y is hermitian y is positive and invertible lemma 2 5 implies that bx y 0 we further note that 0 ax y y ax y 1 x 2 ax y x 2 i e ax y x 2 0 now t x ax y x bx y x ax y x 1 ix 2 ax y x 1 i e t x ax y x 1 therefore t x ax y x 1 x 1 a x y x 1 ax y ax y x 1 t x so 2 5 t x t x now replacing x by ix on 2 5 we obtain from the homogeneity of t that 2 6 t x t x combining 2 5 and 2 6 we obtain that t x 0 which finishes the proof proof of theorem 2 14 let us define t t 1 2 t 1 1 then t is a 2 local triple derivation on m with t 1 0 cf lemma 2 1 and t x t x for every x msa cf lemma 2 2 by lemma 2 15 there exists an element a m such that t x a x for all x msa consider the 2 local triple derivation t a since t a msa 0 lemma 2 16 implies that t a and hence t a 1 2 t 1 1 witnessing the desired statement references 1 sh ayupov k k kudaybergenov 2 local derivations and
