investigate sobolev spaces w 1 associated to musielak orlicz spaces l we first present conditions for the boundedness of the voltera operator in l em ploying this we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for w 1 to contain isomor phic subspaces to or 1 further we give necessary and sufficient conditions in terms of the function or its complementary function for reflexivity uniform convexity b convexity and superreflexivity of w 1 as corollaries we obtain the corresponding re sults for orlicz sobolev spaces w 1 where is an orlicz function the variable exponent sobolev spaces w 1 p and the sobolev spaces associated to double phase functionals 1 introduction the main goal of this paper is to study geometric properties of sobolev spaces w 1 induced by musielak orlicz spaces l where is an orlicz function with parameter called also musielak orlicz function musielak orlicz spaces appeared first time in the literature in 1951 in h nakano paper 30 and later j musielak and w orlicz in 1959 in the paper 29 gave a more general definition often more suitable for applications musielak orlicz spaces engendered some interest and were extensively studied during the seventies eighties and nineties of the last century by various groups of mathematicians across the world in particular the structural and geometrical properties of those spaces were well understood on the other hand the musielak orlicz sobolev spaces mos spaces came to the light late in seventies the first results about mos spaces were established by h hudzik in series of paper between 1976 1979 see e g 15 we remark here that the author needed to assume some rather strong assumptions about the function to establish his results which could be common in the field of mos spaces parallel to the research on mo and mos spaces the variable exponent spaces also called the nakano spaces were of significant interest in terms of mo spaces a variable exponent space lp is a space generated by a function of the form tp x p x where p x is a measurable function such that p x 1 surprisingly a serious investigation into sobolev spaces based on lp began only in the nineties of the last century with the paper of o kova cik and j ra kosn k 23 where the authors proved some basic properties of variable exponent sobolev spaces after the initial interest in the mos spaces the research in the area remained dor mant for almost a decade surprisingly the research was reinvigorated by the interest of those spaces for their application in physics one of the applications of mos came from modeling electrorheological fluids fluids whose viscosity changes in the presence of an electrical field in 2000 m ruzicka 31 provided a model for mechanics of those fluids that date december 14 2021 2010 mathematics subject classification 46

spaces in 2002 l diening in his dissertation 9 expanded the theory of ruzicka and provided among other things the sufficient condition on the regularity of the exponent p x to guarantee the boundedness of hardy litllewood maximal operator those results rekindled the interest in mos spaces and motivated other authors to study partial differential equations in the context of mos spaces 5 the paper consists of six sections in the introductory part we define several notions related to banach function spaces musielak orlicz spaces l their norms and useful inequalities of musielak orlicz functions mo functions we also consider variable exponent and double phase mo functions showing necessary and sufficient conditions for those functions and their conjugates to satisfy the growth condition 2 at the end we define musielak orlicz sobolew spaces mos spaces w 1 on a finite interval in the second section we study integral operators between musielak orlicz spaces in particular we obtain a characterization of the bounded voltera operators on l under the assumption of so called v condition it appears that v condition is always satisfied in orlicz spaces variable exponent lebesgue spaces as well as in the spaces induced by double phase functionals the third section is devoted to characterization of the sobolev spaces w 1 containing an isomorphic subspace of before that we complete the analogous results in mo spaces and in particular in variable exponent lebesgue spaces it appears that the lack of the growth condition 2 of is a sufficient condition for w 1 to contain of and is also necessary whenever condition v is satisfied in the fourth section we do analogous investigations concerning the existence of a sub space isomorphic to 1 in w 1 we obtain that if either or does not satisfy 2 then w 1 contains such a subspace the necessity of this occurs under condition v it follows complete characterizations of the containment of 1 in orlicz sobolev spaces w 1 variable exponent lebesgue spaces lp or variable exponent sobolev spaces w 1 p the short fifth section states necessary and sufficient conditions on reflexivity of w 1 followed by corresponding corollaries in w 1 p and w 1 section sixth is the main part of this paper here we characterize uniform convexity of w 1 it is expressed in terms of and its conjugate since w 1 is an isometric subspace of the product l l the conditions for uniform convexity for l are sufficient for uniform convexity of w 1 the key result here is to show that those conditions 2 of and uniform convexity of are also necessary in this part we also give a complete characterization of uniform convexity of lp as well as w 1 p and w 1 in the last section seven on the basis of the previous results we show that under condition v reflexivity superreflexivity and b convexity in w 1 are equivalent and they hold whenever and satisfy 2 we obtain analogous results in orlicz sobolev spaces w 1 and variable exponent sobolev spaces w 1 p all results contained in this paper are proved for mo space l or mos space w 1 where is a general mo function occasionally with mild assumption in the particular case where is a variable exponent function most results hold true without any additional assumptions and have not been known before let further r be the set of real numbers n the set of natural numbers and r 0 let be a measurable space where is a algebra of subsets of and is a finite complete measure on by l 0 l 0 denote the set of all measurable complex valued functions on recall that x x is a banach function space if x l 0 and if f l 0 g x and f g a e then f x and f x g x we say that a banach function space x x has the fatou property if for any 0 fn f a e fn x f l 0 and supn fn x then f x and fn x f x as n an element f x is called order continuous whenever for any 0 fn f with fn 0 a e we have fn x 0 geometric properties of sobolev spaces w 1 3 letting xa be the set of all order continuous elements from x and xb be the closure of all simple functions from x we have xa xb let x be the dual space to x the ko the dual space x of x 3 32 is defined as follows x f l 0 g x sup fg d f x 1 the space x equipped with the norm x is a banach function space satisfying the fatou property if xa xb and x has the fatou property then xa is isometrically isomorphic to x in this case x x x s where the symbol denotes linear isometry and x s x a is the set of all singular functionals that is the set of s x such that s f 0 for every f xa for references on function spaces see 3 22 26 27 32 a function 0 0 is called an orlicz function with extended values if is not identically 0 limt 0 t 0 0 and is left continuous and convex on 0 b where b sup t 0 t if for every t 0 t then is called an orlicz function 24 27 a function 0 0 is called a musielak orlicz function with extended values emo function for short if for a a x x is an orlicz function with extended values and for all t 0 t is measurable if in addition x t for a a x t 0 then it is called a musielak orlicz function mo function for short given a musielak orlicz function with extended values the musielak orlicz space mo space called also generalized orlicz space l l consists of all functions f l 0 such that i f x f x d x for some 0 the luxemburg norm f inf 0 i f 1 and the orlicz norm f 0 sup i g 1 f x g x d x sup i g 1 fg d are two equivalent standard norms considered in l in fact f f 0 2 f for any f l in particular case when does not depend on the parameter that is x t t for a a x t 0 where is an orlicz function then l is an orlicz space the musielak orlicz space l with either norm is a banach function lattice satisfying the fatou property for any mo function l a l b if we do not mention otherwise we will always consider the mo space l equipped with the luxemburg norm extensive information about musielak orlicz spaces one can find in 8 10 14 16 17 21 28 given an emo function by denote the complementary function to that is x t sup s 0 st x s a a x t 0 the reason that we also consider emo functions in this paper is that even if a mo function has finite values its complementary function may achieve infinite values the function x t t x t 0 is the simplest example of such functions it is well known and not difficult to show that is emo function that is a musielak orlicz function with extended values and in view of the simple observation that i f 1 if and only if f 1 the following ho lder inequalities are satisfied for any f l g l f g d f 0 g f g d f g 0 4 anna kamin ska and mariusz z yluk we say thatmo

one can show that when and is non atomic then satisfies 2 if and only if for some k 0 and u 0 0 2 2 u k u for all u u 0 the growth condition 2 of plays an important role in the theory of mo spaces recall now some results in mo spaces which we will need later theorem 1 1 28 theorem 7 6 theorem 8 14 3 proposition 3 10 theorem 3 13 let be a mo function the following properties are equivalent i the space l is order continuous that is l l a l b ii the modular convergence i u 0 is equivalent to norm convergence u 0 iii satisfies 2 theorem 1 2 28 theorem 7 10 the mo space l is separable if and only if the measure is separable and satisfies 2 theorem 1 3 let be mo function i 21 theorem a 4 28 l l 0 and l 0 l ii 32 l l 0 l s where l s l a iii 28 l is reflexive if and only if both and satisfy condition 2 given mo functions i i 1 2 the symbol 2 1 denotes that there exist a constant k 0 and a non negative function h l 1 such that 2 x kt 1 x t h t a a x t 0 we say that 1 and 2 are equivalent if 2 1 and 1 2 the equivalence of two mo functions preserves condition 2 theorem 1 4 28 given mo functions i i 1 2 l 1 l 2 if and only if 2 1 the embedding of the spaces l 1 l 2 is automatically bounded consequently l 1 l 2 as sets with equivalent norms if and only if 1 is equivalent to 2 proof the proof of the first part can be found in 28 the automatic boundedness of the embedding among mo spaces follows from 3 proposition 2 10 p 13 in view of the fatou property of mo spaces for a emo function r 0 define the generalized inverse of by the formula 1 x t inf u x u t a a x t 0 clearly we have x 1 x t t for a a x and t 0 proposition 1 5 let be emo function then i the young inequality st x s x t a a x s t 0 geometric properties of sobolev spaces w 1 5 ii for a a x t 0 1 1 t 1 x t 1 x t 2 t proof i it is a direct consequence of the definition of the complementary function ii this is well known for orlicz n functions e g 24 for the sake of completeness we provide a short proof here for the right inequality take x and t 0 and let u 1 x t and v 1 x t then 1 x t 1 x t uv x u x v 2 t by the young inequality for the left inequality recall that x t t 0 x s ds x t t 0 1 x s ds a a x t 0 where x t is the right derivative of x t with respect to t 0 for a a x and 1 is a generalized inverse as defined above for for any x and u 0 such that x u u 0 x s ds t we have t u x u u 1 u u 0 x s ds x u u u x u it follows in view of 1 x x u u x t u t u 0 1 x s ds 1 x t u t u 1 x x u t u t applying now 1 to both sides of the above inequality for any u t 0 with x u t we get u 1 x t t hence for a a x t 0 1 x t 1 x t inf u x u t 1 x t t which is the left inequality of 1 1 lemma 1 6 let x t be the right derivative of a mo function x t for a a x with respect to t 0 if exists a constant k 1 such that 1 2 x 2 t k x t a a x t 0 then satisfies condition 2 proof integrating the inequality 1 2 we get for s 0 s 0 x 2 t dt 1 2 2 s 0 x u du 1 2 x 2 s k s 0 x t dt k x s hence x 2 s 2 k x s it follows x s 2 1 2 k x s and thus x 2 s sup u 0 us x u 2 sup u 0 us 1 2 k x u 1 2 k x 2 ks 6 anna kamin ska and mariusz z yluk hence for a a x s 0 x ks 2 k x s which implies 2 condition of by the assumption k 1 the important class of musielak orlicz spaces are nakano spaces recently also called variable exponent lebesgue spaces let 1 p x for a a x be a measurable function and let 1 3 x t tp x p x a a x t 0 then lp l is a variable exponent lebesgue space for 1 p x a e in t 0 x t tq x q x where 1 p x 1 q x 1 let further p ess sup x p x and p ess inf x p x in the literature there is another version of the nakano spaces given by themo function tp x for 1 p x a a x t 0 the spaces defined in either way are equal as sets with equivalent norms in order to avoid confusion we will consider here only the spaces given by formula 1 3 theorem 1 7 the variable exponent mo function x t tp x p x 1 p x for a a x t 0 satisfies 2 if and only if p its complement function satisfies 2 if and only if p 1 proof assume that x t tp x p x satisfies 2 there exists c 2 and an positive integrable function h such that for a a x and t 0 we have 2 p x tp x p x x 2 t c x t h x c tp x p x h x hence 2 p x c tp x p x h x if p x 1 for a e x then clearly satisfies 2 condition now if p x 6 1 for a a x then for a a x it follows that sup t 0 tp x p x therefore we conclude that 2 p x c a a x it follows that for a a x we have p x log 2 c and so p log 2 c if on the other hand p then for a a x and any t 0 we have x 2 t 2 p x tp x p x 2 p tp x p x 2 p x t that is satisfies 2 as for the second assertion notice that x t tq x q x where q x p x p x 1 by the first part of the proof x t satisfies 2 if and only if q by the fact that u u 1 is a decreasing function on 1 and lim u 1 u u 1 we have q x p x p x 1 p p 1 a a x geometric properties of sobolev spaces w 1 7 therefore we conclude that q if and only if p 1 another important class of mo functions is a class of double phase functionals consist ing of r r such that x t tp x a x tr x where a p r are measurable functions on a x 0 a e and 1 p x r x a e denote by r and r analogously as p and p respectively theorem 1 8 let x t tp x a x tr x where a p r are measurable functions on a x 0 a e and 1 p x r x a e i if r then satisfies 2 ii if p 1 then satisfies condition 2 iii if in addition we assume that p x r x for a a x 1 where 1 suppa then satisfies condition 2 if and only if p and r 1 ess supx 1 r x proof if 1 0 that is a x 0 for a a x then the space l is reduced to the lebesgue variable space lp and the conclusion follows from theorem 1 7 thus assume 1 0 i if p and r 1 then x 2 t 2 p x tp x 2 r x a x tr x 2 r tp x a x tr x 2 r x t where r max p r 1 and so satisfies condition 2 ii let p 1 then for a a x t 0 x 2 t p x 2 p x 1 tp x 1 a x r x 2 r x 1 tr x 1 2 p 1 p x tp x 1 a x r x 2 p 1 tr x 1 2 p 1 x t where 2 p 1 1 we conclude by lemma 1 6 iii now let satisfy 2 and p or r 1 then by definition of 2 there exists c 0 such that the function hc x sup t 0 x 2 t c x t belongs to l 1 we shall consider three cases case 10 let p 1 ess supx 1 p x if 1 0 then x t t p x for a a x 1 and by theorem 1 7 it is a contradiction because can not satisfy condition 2 case 20 let p 1 define an x 1 p x n n n by assumptions for every n n an 0 and for a a x an r x p x n choose n n such that 2 n c then for x an t 0 x 2 t c x t 2 ntp x a x 2 ntr x ctp x ca x tr x 2 n c tp x a x tr x 2 n c x t hence hc x for every x an and c 2 n therefore hc is not integrable over and by monotonicity of hc with respect to c hc l 1 for every c 0 consequently does 8 anna kamin ska and mariusz z yluk not satisfy 2 case 30 let p and r 1 we can assume that c 2 p thus 2 p x c 0 a a x let x 1 then a x 0 and p x r x 0 by assumptions therefore there exists tx 2 such that for all t tx tp x r x a x for a a y we have y 2 t c y t tr y 2 p y c tp y r y 2 r y c a y hence for a fixed t tx x 2 t c x t tr x 2 p x c tp x r x 2 r x c a x tr x 2 p x c a x 2 r x c a x tr x a x 2 p x 2 r x 2 c tr x a x 2 r x 2 c let for n n bn x 1 r x n since r 1 there is n such that for all n n bn 0 and 2 n 2 c therefore for t 0 x bn and n n tr x a x 2 r x 2 c tr x a x 2 n 2 c thus for any x bn and tx tx sup t 0 x 2 t c x t sup t 0 tr x a x 2 r x 2 c tr x x a x 2 n 2 c since tx can be taken arbitrary big it follows for n n and for a a x bn hc t sup t 0 tr x a x 2 r x 2 c hence hc x for every x bn therefore if c 2 n then hc is not integrable but n can be chosen arbitrary large so for every c 0 hc l 1 in applications there are often used double phase functionals where the functions p x and r x are constants consequently in view of theorem 1 8 we get the corollary corollary 1 9 let be a double phase functional of the following form x t tp a x tr a a x t 0 where 1 p r and a x 0 for a a x then satisfies 2 and if p 1 then fulfills 2 let with the lebesgue measure by l 1 loc l 1 loc denote the set of all locally integrable functions on that is all functions f l 0 such that k f d for every compact set k by c c we denote the space of all smooth complex valued functions on with compact supports by a smooth function we mean a function which has all derivatives recall a function f l 1 loc is weakly differentable if there exists a function f l 1 loc such that for every u c c we have f x u x dx f x u x dx geometric properties of sobolev spaces w 1 9 then the function f is called the weak derivative of f if f r is absolutely continuous on every compact subinterval of then f is weakly differentiable and f coincides with the classical derivative of f a e 13 theorem 7 16 given a mo function the musielak orlicz sobolev space mos space w 1 w 1 consists of all f l 1 loc such that their weak derivative f exists and 1 4 f 1 f f the space w 1 is often called a generalized sobolev space or if we know the context just a sobolev space if is an orlicz function then w 1 is an orlicz sobolev space in the case of variable exponentmo function the variable exponent sobolev space is denoted by w 1 p the space w 1 equipped with the norm 1 is a complete space 14 theorem 6 1 4 in the case of w 1 p see also 8 theorem 6 6 10 theorem 8 1 6 anytime further we will use sobolev spaces w 1 they will always be defined on the finite interval equipped with the lebesgue measure 2 integral operators in l the integral operators in orlicz spaces have been studied among others in 24 here we will study the integral operators in musielak orlicz spaces let be a finite measure space for mo functions 1 2 define the function 2 1 x y t 2 x 1 y t a a x y t 0 note first that 1 can achieve infinite values and so it is emo function we will adopt the convention that if 1 y t then x y t 2 x therefore r 0 is a emo denote by l the musielak orlicz space as a subspace of l 0 by and 0 we mean the luxemburg and orlicz norm on l respectively lemma 2 1 let i i 1 2 be mo functions on where assume 2 x b d x for some b 0 let r 0 be such that x y t 2 x 1 y t a a x y t 0 and let then there exists

consequently au 0 2 sup i 2 v 1 au x v x d x l k u 1 and thus a is bounded from l 1 to l 2 corollary 2 3 let i i 1 2 be mo functions on and assume there exists b 0 such that 2 x b d x let r 0 be such that x y t 2 x 1 y t a a x y t 0 if k x y l then the operator au x k x y u y d y is bounded from l 1 to l 2 proof by lemma 2 1 there is l 0 such that for any u l 1 v l 2 and w x y u y v x we have w 0 l u 1 v 2 where consequently the assumptions of theorem 2 2 are satisfied and a is bounded the next result follows immediately from corollary 2 3 corollary 2 4 let be amo function on with and such that x b d x for some b 0 let x y t x y t x y t 0 if k x y l then au x k x y u y d y is bounded from l to l now we wish to formulate a condition for the voltera operator to be bounded from l to itself for it requires some preparations lemma 2 5 given a mo function on we have that ess infx x a 0 for some a 0 if and only if there exists c 0 with ess supx x c proof if ess infx x a 0 for some a 0 then x a m 0 for a a x and some m hence a 1 x m thus in view of 1 1 1 x m m 1 x m m a therefore m ess supx x c with c m a in the opposite direction the proof goes in a similar way definition 2 6 let equipped with the lebesgue measure we say that mo function satisfies condition v if for some a b 0 v x b dx and ess inf x x a 0 theorem 2 7 let equipped with the lebesgue measure assume is a mo function on satisfying the condition v then the voltera operator au x x u y dy x is bounded on l 12 anna kamin ska and mariusz z yluk proof by lemma 2 5 we get ess supx x c for some c 0 now by

operator is bounded on lp proof since for variable exponent mo function x 1 1 p x 1 and x 1 1 q x 1 for a a x so in view of lemma 2 5 the conditions in theorem 2 7 are satisfied and the conclusion holds corollary 2 10 let be a double face functional that is x t tp x a x tr x where a p r are real measurable functions on such that a x 0 1 p x 1 r x a e on if a l 1 then the voltera operator is bounded on l proof we have x 1 dx a x dx and clearly ess infx x 1 1 in view of theorem 2 7 we conclude the proof 3 copy of in this part we give conditions on in order to w 1 contain a subspace isomorphic to we start with musielak orlicz space l proposition 3 1 19 20 let be a non atomic measure space then a emo function does not satisfy condition 2 if and only if there exists a sequence of bounded and non negative functions fn l such that fn fm 0 for n 6 m i fn 1 2 n and fn 1 for all n n consequently n 1 fn fn 1 geometric properties of sobolev spaces w 1 13 for all n n the next theorem results directly from proposition 3 1 theorem 3 2 let the measure space be separable and non atomic a musielak orlicz space l contains an isomorphic copy of if and only if does not satisfy condition 2 proof if 2 then taking any element a an n 1 and the sequence fn n 1 from proposition 3 1 we get for every n n an anfn n 1 anfn a it follows n 1 anfn a and in fact is an isometric isomorphic subspace of l now assume opposite that l has a subspace isomorphic to then l can not be separable and so 2 by theorem 1 2 corollary 3 3 let the measure space be separable and non atomic the variable exponent lebesgue space lp contains an isomorphic subspace to if and only if p proof by theorem 1 7 the variable exponential function satisfies 2 if and only if p therefore the proof is completed by application of theorem 3 2 theorem 3 4 let be a mo function on with the lebesgue measure if w 1 contains a subspace isomorphic to then does not satisfy condition 2 proof let a f f f w 1 be a subspace of the product l l if l l is equipped with the norm l l then the spacew 1 is isometrically isomorphic to a notice that l l is isomorphic to the mo space l 1 2 where 1 2 0 0 is defined as x y t x t 1 y x t 2 y for a a x y 1 2 and t 0 indeed the operator t l l l 1 2 defined by t f 1 f 2 x y f 1 x 1 y f 2 x 2 y f 1 f 2 l for a a x y 1 2 is clearly a linear bijection and its inverse is given by t 1 f x f x 1 f x 2 f l 1 2 moreover taking any f 1 f 2 6 0 0 where f 1 f 2 l l i t f 1 f 2 2 f 1 f 2 l l x f 1 x 2 f 1 f 2 dx x f 2 x 2 f 1 f 2 dx 1 14 anna kamin ska and mariusz z yluk therefore for every f 1 f 2 l l we have t f 1 f 2 l 2 f 1 f 2 l l on the other hand if 0 6 f l 1 2 then for j 1 2 i f j f x f x j f dx x f x 1 f dx x f x 2 f dx i f f 1 hence f j f for j 1 2 consequently for every f l 1 2 we have t 1 f l l f 1 f 2 2 f from this we conclude that indeed l l is isomorphic to l 1 2 if w 1 contains isomorphically then l l does it too and so l must contain which implies that does not satisfy condition 2 by theorem 3 2 now we argue by contradiction if satisfies 2 then there exist a constant c 0 and a non negative function h l 1 such that for any t 0 and a a x x 2 t c x t h x hence for any t 0 and a a x y 1 2 we have x y 2 t x 2 t 1 y x 2 t 2 y c x t h x 1 y c x t h x 2 y c x y t h x 1 y 2 y the function h given by the formula h x y h x 1 y 2 y is a non negative element of l 1 1 2 therefore satisfies the 2 condition a contradiction theorem 3 5 let where and be a mo function on satisfying condition v if does not satisfy condition 2 then the sobolev space w 1 contains a subspace isomorphic to proof let fk l satisfy the hypothesis of proposition 3 1 since they are bounded on so fk l 1 define gk x x fk y dy x k n we have that gk w 1 indeed g k fk l and by the assumption v the voltera operator is bounded on l and so gk l fk for some constant l moreover for every k n 1 fk gk 1 fk gk 1 l fk 1 l analogously for every m n 1 m k 1 gk 1 m k 1 gk m k 1 gk 3 1 m k 1 fk m k 1 gk 1 l

akgk 1 a combining 3 2 and 3 3 we have that is an isomorphic copy in w 1 since v is always satisfied in orlicz space over we get instantly the following result corollary 3 6 let where the orlicz sobolev space w 1 contains an isomorphic subspace to if and only if does not satisfy condition 2 corollary 3 7 let where the variable exponent sobolev space w 1 p contains an isomorphic subspace to if and only if p proof by corollary 2 9 the variable exponent function satisfies condition v thus the proof is an immediate consequence of theorems 3 4 and 3 5 the next result follows from proposition 1 8 corollary 3 8 let where let the sobolev space w 1 be induced by the double phase functional x t tp x a x tr x with a p r measurable functions on such that a x 0 and p x r x for a a x then w 1 contains an isomorphic subspace to if and only if p or r 4 copy of 1 in this section we will characterize the spaces w 1 that contain an isomorphic copy of 1 first we need to recall an analogous result for mo spaces l theorem 4 1 let be a non atomic and separable measure space a mo space l contains an isomorphic copy of 1 if and only if or do not satisfy condition 2 16 anna kamin ska and mariusz z yluk proof if does not satisfy condition 2 then l contains isomorphically by theorem 3 2 and so 1 is an isomorphic subspace of l 4 corollary 6 8 if does not satisfy 2 then l contains an isomorphic subspace of again by theorem 3 2 thus applying theorem 1 3 the dual space l l l s must also contain an isomorphic copy of finally by general result in banach spaces 25 proposition 2 e 8 the space l must contain a subspace isomorphic to 1 if l contains a subspace isomorphic to 1 then it can not be reflexive and so by theorem 1 3 or does not satisfy 2 corollary 4 2 let be a non atomic and separable measure space the variable exponent lebesgue space lp contains an isomorphic subspace to 1 if and only if p or p 1 proof the proof follows from theorems 1 7 and 4 1 theorem 4 3 let where if a mo function and its conjugate satisfy condition 2 then w 1 does not contain an isomorphic subspace of 1 proof if both and satisfy condition 2 then the space l is reflexive by theorem 1 3 hence l l equipped with norm l l is reflexive and so w 1 as its closed subspace is reflexive too therefore it can not contain a subspace 1 theorem 4 4 let where let be mo function satisfying condition v if w 1 does not contain a subspace isomorphic to 1 then both and satisfy 2 proof let first do not satisfy 2 by theorem 3 5 is an isomorphic copy in w 1 thus 1 is contained isomorphically in by 4 corollary 6 8 and so in w 1 assume now that does not satisfy 2 then in view of proposition 3 1 there exists a sequence of bounded and non negative functions fk l such that fk fi 0 k 6 i and 4 1 k 1 fk fk 1 k n hence 4 2 1 fk fk 0 2 fk 2 k n by the definition of the orlicz norm 0 for 0 each k n there exists a non negative bounded function gk l such that ess supp gk ess supp fk i gk 1 and 4 3 fk 0 2 k fk x gk x dx define hk x x gk y dy x k n thus its derivative h k gk l moreover by the boundedness of the voltera operator hk l gk l which implies that hk also belongs to l clearly for every k n hk 1 gk hk 1 l geometric properties of sobolev spaces w 1 17 hence for all a ak 1 m n m k 1 ak hk 1 m k 1 ak hk 1 1 l a 1 on the other hand m k 1 ak hk 1 m k 1 ak hk m k 1 ak h k m k 1 ak gk and by ho lder s inequality and by 4 1 4 2 1 2 m k 1 ak gk x m k 1 sign ak fk x dx 1 2 m k 1 ak gk 2 m k 1 fk m k 1 ak gk therefore in view of ess supp gk ess supp fk and of that fk are disjoint and of 4 2 4 3 we get

arbitrary combining the above inequalities we get 1 2 a 1 k 1 ak hk 1 1 l a 1 which shows that w 1 contains an isomorphic subspace of 1 and completes the proof in view of v satisfied in any orlicz space the next result is an instant corollary of theorems 4 3 and 4 4 corollary 4 5 let where and be an orlicz function then the space w 1 does not contain isomorphic copy of 1 if and only if and satisfy condition 2 corollary 4 6 let where the space w 1 p does not contain isomorphic copy of 1 if and only if 1 p p proof we observe first that the voltera operator is bounded on lp by corollary 2 9 therefore the conclusion follows by theorem 1 7 and theorems 4 3 and 4 4 corollary 4 7 let where let the sobolev space w 1 be induced by the double phase function x t tp x a x tr x with a p r measurable functions on such that a x 0 and p x r x for a a x if r and p 1 then w 1 does not contain an isomorphic subspace to 1 18 anna kamin ska and mariusz z yluk proof the voltera operator is bounded on l by corollary 2 10 therefore by theorems 4 3 and 4 4 w 1 does not contain an isomorphic subspace to 1 if and only if and satisfy 2 on the other hand in view of proposition 1 8 i by the assumption that r satisfies condition 2 and by the assumption p 1 satisfies 2 and the conclusion follows 5 reflexivity of w 1 theorem 5 1 let where and be a mo function if both and satisfy condition 2 then w 1 is reflexive let be mo function satisfying condition v if the space w 1 is reflexive then both and satisfy condition 2 proof if both and satisfy 2 then the mo space l is reflexive by theorem 1 3 iii and so is w 1 let assume now condition v that the voltera operator is bounded on l if w 1 is reflexive then it can not contain isomorphic copy of therefore by theorem 3 5 satisfies 2 similarly w 1 can not contain an isomorphic copy of 1 and thus by theorem 4 4 also satisfies 2 since v is fulfilled in any orlicz space so we have the following corollary corollary 5 2 let where and be an orlicz function then the space w 1 is reflexive if and only if and satisfy condition 2 corollary 5 3 let where the space w 1 p is reflexive if and only if 1 p p proof we observe first that the voltera operator is bounded on lp by corollary 2 9 therefore the conclusion follows by theorem 5 1 6 uniform convexity of w 1 the concept of uniform convexity of a banach space x was first introduced by james a clarkson in 1936 where the author showed the uniform convexity of p and lp spaces for 1 p since then many authors had studied this property in other instances of banach spaces as orlicz or musielak orlicz spaces 6 18 16 let x be a banach space equipped with the norm we denote by s x and b x the unit sphere and unit ball of x respectively we say the x is strictly convex whenever x y 2 1 for any x y s x x 6 y recall that x is uniformly convex for short uc if 0 1 0 x y b x x y x y 2 1 it is not difficult to show that equivalently x is uc whenever for any sequences xn yn b x xn yn 2 implies xn yn 0 as n a mo function is called strictly convex if for a a x the function t 7 x t is strictly convex on r that is a a 0 x a u 6 v r 0 1 x u 1 v x u 1 x v geometric properties of sobolev spaces w 1 19 following 6 16 we say that a mo function is uniformly convex if 0 0 0 f l 0 x f x dx 6 1 and whenever u v 0 a a x u v max u v and u v f x then x u v 2 1 2 x u x v it is not difficult to show that is uniformly convex if and only if for every 0 6 2 lim c 0 x p c x dx 0 where p c x sup u v u v e c x with 6 3 e c x u v u v 0 u v max u v and x u v 2 1 2 1 c x u x v first version of uniform convexity for an orlicz function was defined in the doctoral thesis of w a j luxemburg 27 he showed that l is uniformly convex if satisfies condition 2 and is uniformly convex later in 18 three versions of uniform convexity of have been introduced one for the case of non atomic infinite measure another one for non atomic finite measure and one for counting measure it was also proved that ap propriate 2 condition and uniform convexity of are necessary and sufficient conditions of uniform convexity of l combining all three conditions in the case of mo function results in the present form 6 1 where we have a function f with small modular i f if f 0 a e on then in fact the inequality defining uniform convexity of is the same condition as in the original paper 27 uniform for every parameter x the definition of uniform convexity of seems to be quite complicated but in the next remark is explained that this condition not only implies strict convexity of but something more a sort of uniform strict convexity in fact it can be expressed by the uniform inequalities of ratios of its derivatives this was first observed in 1 for orlicz functions and later in 17 for mo functions remark 6 1 1 it is standard to show that a uniformly convex function is strictly convex on r for a e x 2 17 the condition for being uniformly convex can be expressed in terms of its derivatives let x t denote the right derivative of x t with respect to t 0 for a a x then is uniformly convex if for every 0 there exists a constant k 1 such that 6 4 x 1 t k x t for a a x every t 0 characterization of uc of l was considered in 16 and later in 6 partial results on uniform convexity of l or lp have been given in section 2 4 in 10 recall the complete characterization of uc in l theorem 6 2 6 theorem 5 15 let be a non atomic separable measure space the mo space l is uniformly convex if and only if satisfies 2 and is uniformly convex 20 anna kamin ska and mariusz z yluk lemma 6 3 let x t t p x p x t 0 1 p x a a x if p 1 then is uniformly convex proof let p 1 then for a a x x 1 t 1 p x tp x 1 1 p tp x 1 k x t where k 1 p 1 thus we showed 6 4 and is uniformly convex lemma 6 4 let r r be a double phase functional that is 6 5 x t tp x a x tr x where a p r are measurable functions on a x 0 a e and 1 p x r x a e if p 1 then is uniformly convex proof let p 1 then for a a x t 0 x 1 t p x 1 p x 1 tp x 1 a x r x 1 r x 1 tr x 1 1 p 1 p x tp x 1 a x r x 1 p 1 tr x 1 1 p 1 x t where 1 p 1 1 it follows uniform convexity of by 6 4 partial results of the next corollary are known 10 but here we present a complete criterion of uniform convexity of lp corollary 6 5 let be a non atomic separable measure space the variable exponent lebesgue space lp is uniformly convex if and only if 1 p p proof if 1 p p then x t t p x p x satisfies 2 by theorem 1 7 and is uniformly convex by lemma 6 3 thus the space is uniformly convex in view of theorem 6 2 on the other hand uniform convexity of lp implies reflexivity of the space and so it cannot have an isomorphic subspace of 1 and thus 1 p p by corollary 4 2 corollary 6 6 let be a non atomic separable measure space if is a double phase functional of the form 6 5 then the space l is uniformly convex if 1 p and r proof if p 1 then by lemma 6 4 is uniformly convex if r then satisfies 2 by theorem 1 8 we conclude in view of theorem 6 2 now we proceed to consider uniform convexity of mos space w 1 theorem 6 7 let where let be a mo function and w 1 be the sobolev space equipped with the norm f 1 f f f w 1 if satisfies condition 2 and is uniformly convex then the space w 1 is uniformly convex if in addition satisfies v then 2 and uniform convexity of are also necessary conditions for the space w 1 to be uniformly convex proof by theorem 6 2 if satisfies condition 2 and is uniformly convex then the space l is uniformly convex therefore l l equipped with norm 1 4 is also uniformly convex and so is w 1 geometric properties of sobolev spaces w 1 21 let now satisfy v andw 1 be uniformly convex then the spacew 1 is reflexive and so it can not have a subspace isomorphic to by theorem 3 5 needs to satisfy condition 2 thus assume that satisfies 2 and is not uniformly convex it follows by 6 2 that there exist 0 and a sequence ck 0 1 with limk ck 0 and lim k x p ck x dx 0 hence there are 0 n 0 such that for all k n 6 6 x p ck x dx 2 in view of 6 3 for every c 0 1 there exists a sequence uc k vc k of non negative mea surable functions satisfying the following conditions 6 7 uck x v c k x p c x if k for a a x if uck x 6 v c k x then x u c k x v c k x max x u c k x x v c k x and x uc k x vc k x 2 1 c 2 x uck x x v c k x by 6 6 and 6 7 for every k n there exsts jk n such that for all k n x u ck jk x v ck jk x dx 1 2 x p ck x dx letting uk u ck jk vk v ck jk and applying the above inequalities we obtain for every k n 6 8 i uk vk x uk x vk x dx and if uk x 6 vk x then 6 9 x uk x vk x max x uk x x vk x 6 10 x 1 2 uk x vk x 1 ck 2 x uk x x vk x in view of 2 by theorem 1 1 there exists 0 such that for all u l 6 11 i u u by 6 8 for every k n we find the sets ek satisfying ek x uk x 6 vk x and ek x uk x vk x dx if x ek then uk x 6 vk x and by 6 9 x uk x vk x x uk x hence 6 12 ek x uk x dx ek x uk x vk x dx it follows in view of 6 11 that uk ek consequently and by symmetry for all k n uk ek 1 and vk ek 1 let for each k n k x ek x uk x x vk x and k ek k 22 anna kamin ska and mariusz z yluk set also k k x uk x x vk x dx and k k x vk x x uk x dx clearly k k 0 therefore for each k n there exists fk k satisfying fk x uk x x vk x dx k 2 hence fk x uk x x vk x dx k fk x uk x x vk x dx which implies that fk x vk x dx k fk x uk x dx k fk x vk x dx fk x uk x dx analogously for every k n there exists f k k such that f k x vk x dx k f k x uk x dx k f k x vk x dx f k x uk x dx setting now for k n x k uk fk k f k vk f k k fk y k vk fk k f k uk f k k fk we get fk k f k f k k fk ek fk k f k f k k fk and i x k i y k for all k n in view of 6 9 and 6 12 i uk vk ek i max uk vk ek and so by 6 11 max uk vk ek hence max uk vk ek 1 and conse quently i max uk vk ek 1 since x k max uk vk ek and y k max uk vk ek we get k i x k i y k i max uk vk ek 1 now for every k n in view of ek 0 there exist gk ek and k 0 such that gk x k dx 1 k finally let xk x k ek k ek yk y k ek k ek then for all k n 6 13 i xk i yk 1 moreover by 6 12 0 i uk vk ek i xk yk i x k y k i max x k y k i max uk vk ek 1 consequently for all k n 6 14 0 i xk yk xk yk geometric properties of sobolev spaces w 1 23 since xk yk 1 xk yk 2 1 hence 6 15 xk yk 2 i xk yk 2 moreover i xk

x vk x dx 1 ck 1 by 6 13 when k combining the above and 6 14 6 15 it follows that l is not uniformly convex now we will proceed to show that w 1 is not uniformly convex either recall that a measurable function is called simple if it assumes finite number of values a function f c is called a step function if there exists a finite partition 0 1 m and the numbers ai m i 1 c such that f x m i 1 ai i 1 i x x first observe that the functions uc k vc k satisfying 6 7 can be chosen to be simple functions therefore the functions xk and yk can be also chosen as simple functions the next observation is that these functions can be replaced by step functions in fact it follows from the regularity of the lebesgue measure on and the assumption of 2 condition by theorem 1 1 l is order continuous under the assumption of 2 it implies in particular that for any f l and every 0 there is 0 such that whenever a then f a 3 by regularity of the lebesgue measure for any measurable a with a l and any 0 there exist disjoint open intervals g 1 gm such that a m i 1 gi m i 1 gi a hence a m i 1 gi a m i 1 gi m i 1 gi a therefore we can approximate any measurable subset of by a finite union of open disjoint intervals so any simple function can be replaced by a step function it follows that the functions xk and yk can be taken as step functions recall that xk and yk are non negative by the above discussion without loss of generality assume for every k n xk ak 1 0 1 ak 2 1 2 akmk mk 1 mk where 0 1 mk and aki mk i 1 0 similarly let yk bk 1 0 1 bk 2 1 2 bkjk jk 1 jk with 0 1 jk and bkj jk j 1 0 now let i 1 i m i 1 be the family of all intersections of the intervals p 1 p j 1 j p 1 mk j 1 jk which are neither empty nor reduced to one point let i be ordered as 24 anna kamin ska and mariusz z

l 2 nl 1 such that l 2 i l 2 i 1 max xk yk 1 2 k i 1 nl l 2 i 1 l 2 i max xk yk 1 2 k i 1 nl since each xk or yk is constant on the interval l 1 l so l 2 i l 2 i 1 xk l 2 i 1 l 2 i xk l 2 i l 2 i 1 yk

k y k xk yk for all k n it shows that w 1 is not uniformly convex and the proof is finished the next result follows from theorems 6 2 and 6 7 corollary 6 8 let let satisfy v then l is uniformly convex if and only if w 1 is uniformly convex this in turn is equivalent to satisfying 2 and being uniformly convex corollary 6 9 let the variable exponent sobolev space w 1 p is uniformly convex if and only if 1 p p proof it follows immediately from corollaries 6 8 and 6 5 corollary 6 10 let if is a double phase functional of the form 6 5 then the space w 1 is uniformly convex if 1 p and r proof it follows from corollary 6 6 26 anna kamin ska and mariusz z yluk in the same case of finite and non atomic measure space is uniformly convex if and only if satisfies the following condition 18 0 0 u 0 0 u v u 0 u v max u v 6 18 u v 2 1 2 u v in paper 7 the authors gave a characterization of uniform convexity of w 1 under ad ditional assumption that is a n function moreover their methods are very specific for orlicz functions only and they not applicable in the case of mo functions notice also that for an orlicz function the condition v is always satisfied on that is the voltera operator is bounded on l theorem 2 7 by theorem 6 7 and the above remarks we arrive at the following result corollary 6 11 let where for an orlicz function the orlicz sobolev space w 1 is uniformly convex if and only if satisfies 2 and is uniformly convex in the sense of 6 18 7 superreflexivity and b convexity of w 1 a banach space x is said to be b convex if there exist a 0 and an integer n 2 such that for any x 1 xn x we can choose k n k 1 k 1 in such a way that 1 n n k 1 kxk 1 max 1 k n xk a banach space x is said to be superreflexive if every banach space y which is finitely representable in x is

theorem 5 1 both and satisfy 2 so iv holds iv ii by the assumption that 2 in view of lemma 7 1 there exists a uniformly convex function equivalent to since 2 the function 2 now by theorem 6 2 the space w 1 is uniformly convex and thus superreflexive 2 problem 11 6 since is equivalent to the spacesw 1 andw 1 coincide as sets with equivalent norms see theorem 1 4 it follows that w 1 as isomorphic to w 1 is superreflexive iv iii by 12 example 3 ii p 118 any uniformly convex space is b convex by 2 in view of lemma 7 1 there exists a uniformly convex function equivalent to since 2 is preserved by equivalence 2 in view of theorem 6 2 the space w 1 is uniformly convex and thus is b convex in the same paper 12 in corollary 6 it was proved that if banach spaces x and y are isomorphic then x is b convex if and geometric properties of sobolev spaces w 1 27 only if y is b convex it follows that w 1 is b convex as w 1 and w 1 coincide as sets with equivalent norms iii iv if 2 then w 1 contains a subspace isomorphic to by theorem 3 5 and since is not b convex 12 example 3 iv it contradicts the assumption of b convexity of w 1 if 2 then w 1 contains a subspace isomorphic to 1 by theorem 4 4 however 1 is not b convex 12 example 3 iv or 11 and so w 1 can not be b convex in the next result let x t t for all x t 0 then is an orlicz function and l is an orlicz space for and an orlicz function the condition v is always satisfied by theorem 2 7 and the condition 2 achieves a simpler form 2 by these remarks and theorem 7 2 we get the following corollary in orlicz sobolev
