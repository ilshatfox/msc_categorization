von neumann algebra m by properly outer automorphisms in this paper we study the containment m m g of m inside the crossed product we characterize the intermediate von neumann algebras extending earlier work of other authors in the factor case we also determine the m bimodules that are closed in the bures topology and which coincide with the w closed ones under a mild hypothesis on g we use these results to obtain a general version of mercer s theorem concerning the extension of certain isometric w continuous maps on m bimodules to automorphisms of the containing von neumann algebras key

nsf grant dms 1101403 1 http arxiv org abs 1606 02327 v 2 1 introduction in this paper we address several problems that arise in the theory of crossed products before discussing our results we begin by presenting some background let a discrete groupg act on a von neumann algebram by properly outer automorphisms when m is a factor the resulting crossed product m g is also a factor and each sub group h of g gives rise to a natural intermediate factor m m h m g in 9 choda considered the question of whether there is a galois theory in this situation do the crossed products by subgroups of g account for all intermediate factors he was able to give an affirmative answer under an additional hypothesis that each intermediate factor n is the range of a faithful normal conditional expectation e m g n a condition that is automatically satisfied when m is a type ii 1 factor for factors m with separable pred uals the existence of faithful normal conditional expectations onto all intermediate factors was established in 23 providing a galois theory under the separable predual assumption this separability requirement was removed in 8 so that choda s correspondence between intermediate subfactors and subgroups holds for all factors at the other end of the spectrum lie the abelian von neumann algebras and the crossed products by discrete groups give particular examples of cartan inclusions a a g in 28 muhly saito and solel considered general cartan inclusions a m where m is a von neumann algebra and a is a cartan masa in m their interest lay in the triangular subalgebras ofm for which a detailed analysis of the w closed a bimodules was an essential ingredient writing the masa a as l x for a measure space the theory of feldman and moore 16 17 describes m in terms of a measurable equivalence relation r x x and 2 cocycle on r arising from the action of the normalizing unitaries n a m on a the spectral theorem for bimodules 28 theorem 2 5 asserted that the w closed a bimodules could be characterized in terms of measurable subsets of the equivalence relation and this was the main technical device for their subsequent discussion of various types of w closed subalgebras and isomorphisms between them unfortunately as noted in 2 there was a gap in the proof and so the question of whether this theorem is correct remains open although it has been proved in 7 for a possibly smaller class of a bimodules that are closed in a different topology this is a topology introduced by bures 5 and which we term the b topology its definition which we give in section 2 requires a containment p q of von neumann algebras with a faithful normal conditional expectation e q p so applies to cartan inclusions a m as well as those of the form m m g it plays a vital role in the theory of crossed products because the fourier series g g xgg of an element x m g need not converge in the standard von neumann algebra topologies but does converge to x in the b topology 25 for the original formulation of the spectral theorem for bimodules in terms of w closed bimodules only one case has been verified a cartan inclusion a m where m is an amenable von neumann algebra 18 our objective is to develop a general theory of bimodules and subalgebras of crossed products that includes the two types discussed above if we choose a central projection zg z m then a simple example of an m bimodule in m g is mzgg these form the building blocks of the theory since we show that every b closed m bimodule is the b closed span of these specialm bimodules when we require the group g to have the approximation property ap of haagerup and kraus 21 a large class of groups that includes the weakly 2 amenable ones of cowling and haagerup 14 we find that the w closed and b closed m bimodules coincide as a consequence the spectral theorem for bimodules is valid for any cartan inclusion a a g where a is abelian and g has the ap in particular this gives the first classes of cartan inclusions beyond the realm of amenable von neumann algebras for which this theorem has been verified there are some natural candidates for intermediate von neumann algebras m n m g for a set of central projections zg indexed by g form the w closed bimodule n that is the w closed span of mzgg g g then there are some algebraic relations among the zg s to ensure that n is a von neumann algebra and we prove that every inter mediate von neumann algebra has this form for a suitable choice of zg s in 35 takesaki related the existence of normal faithful conditional expectations to properties of the modular automorphism groups of certain faithful normal semifinite weights and we use his theory to show that each intermediate n is the range of such a conditional expectation as a conse quence we show that any such n is b closed and deduce from this the concrete form of the conditional expectation on generators mg for m g it is mg 7 mzgg a theorem of mercer 27 asserted in the case of a cartan masa inclusion a m that an isometric and surjective a bimodule map on a w closed a bimodule x that generates m has an extension to a automorphism of m thus highlighting the essential rigidity of such maps however the argument was flawed and this result was established subsequently for w continuous maps in 7 a hypothesis that was implicit in the original formulation of 27 we apply our results on the bimodules and intermediate von neumann algebras to prove a general version of mercer s extension theorem in theorem 6 6 for crossed product inclusions m m g extending the cartan result of 7 when the cartan masa arises from a a g for an abelian von neumann algebra a for examples of such extension theorems in the context of csl algebras see 15 we note that in the special case when m is a factor we have already established these results in 8 using methods that were particular to factors the paper is organized as follows section 2 has a brief discussion of the b topology and we characterize the b closed bimodules in terms of systems of central projections indexed by the group g theorem 2 4 our classes of cartan inclusions for which the spectral theorem for bimodules is valid are presented in theorem 2 8 in section 3 we characterize the intermediate von neumann algebras for the inclusion m m g theorem 3 3 these all have the form n spanw mzgg g g where the zg s are central projections satisfying some algebraic relations that ensure that n is a unital algebra the next two sections contain preliminary results that lead up to the proof of our main extension theorem for crossed products in theorem 6 6 section 4 deals with certain central groupoid normalizers and our approach is based on results from connes s noncommutative rokhlin theorem 13 these are used to establish lemma 4 4 which shows that a nonzero ideal in a c algebra containing m will have nonzero intersection with m under appropriate hypotheses this is the main result of the section but we also include automatic b continuity of certain conditional expectations and automorphisms for later use we also examine containments of the form m a where a is a c algebra generated by central groupoid normalizers of m here we show that if a conditional expectation onto the smaller algebra exists then it must be unique in contrast to what may happen more generally 1 section 5 establishes that m always norms m g as defined in 30 and this is used subsequently 3 to prove that isometric m bimodule maps are automatically completely isometric in section 6 we establish a version of mercer s extension theorem for general crossed products starting from a w closed m bimodule x we drop to a submodule x 0 generated by the central groupoid normalizers in x and we extend an m bimodule map x x to a automorphism of c x 0 which is the c envelope of x 0 automorphisms of c algebras do not necessarily extend to automorphisms of their containing von neumann algebras so further argument in which the b topology plays a crucial role is needed to finally obtain an automorphism of w x which extends the map we close by noting that our approach to the problems discussed in this paper has been inspired by the ideas and techniques developed in 7 25 28 and we gratefully record our indebtedness to these authors we also thank stuart white for his comments on an earlier draft of the paper 2 structure of bimodules let a n be an inclusion of von neumann algebras with a faithful normal conditional expectation e n a the example of interest for us being m m g with conditional expectation em here g is a discrete group acting onm by properly outer automorphisms g g g a slight abuse of terminology since e id we remind the reader that a automorphism of a von neumann algebra m is inner if there exists a unitary u m so that ad u while is properly outer if there does not exist a nonzero invariant central projection z m so that mz is inner bures 5 introduced a topology on n which we term the b topology defined by the seminorms e x x 1 2 x n 2 1 where ranges over the normal states of a convergence of a net x from n to x n means that lim e x x x x 0 a 2 2 from which it follows that the b topology is weaker than the strong topology throughout we use the term w topology to denote the weak topology on a von neumann algebra we refer to 8 section 3 for a discussion of the b topology but we include the following lemma which is implicit in the proof of 8 lemma 3 2 lemma 2 1 let a n be an inclusion of von neumann algebras with a faithful normal conditional expectation e n a a uniformly bounded net from n is b convergent convergent if and only if it is strongly convergent in particular such a b convergent net is also convergent in the w topology the crossed product mxg is generated by a faithful normal representation of m and unitary operators ug g g so that ug m u g g m for m m and g g 38 for ease of notation we suppress and u and write the generators of m g as mg m m g g subject to the relations gm g m g each element x m g can be represented by a fourier series g g xgg and there is a unique faithful normal conditional expectation em m g m given by em x xe the remaining fourier coefficients 4 are then defined by xg em xg 1 for x m g and g g as shown by mercer 25 this series converges to x in the b topology while it may fail to converge in the more standard von neumann algebra topologies consequently the b topology will play a central role in this paper we now consider the structure of m bimodules inside m g generalizing the results of 8 in the factor case lemma 2 2 let a discrete group g act on a von neumann algebra m by properly outer automorphisms let x m g be a w closed m bimodule then there exist central projections zg z m g g with the following properties i mzgg x ii if x x has fourier series g g xgg then xg mzg for g g and xgg x proof for g g let ig m m mg x then each ig is a w closed ideal in m so has the form mzg for a central projection zg z m then mzgg x verifying i now let jg be the algebraic ideal in m of elements that appear as the g coefficient in the fourier series of some element of x then ig jg so ii will be verified by showing that jg ig let g 0 g be fixed but arbitrary and consider a projection p jg 0 with central support z p there is at least one such projection since 0 jg 0 by 32 p 61 there exist partial isometries vi m such that i v i pvi z if x g g xgg x with xg 0 p then define y g g ygg x by y i v i x g 0 1 vi the sum converging in the w topology we note that the g 0 coefficent is yg 0 i v i pvi z thus z jg by 11 theorem 3 3 there is a net of sets of elements mj j j mj m such that i j j m jmj 1 ii for each completely bounded map m m and each x m lim j j xm j mj exists in the w topology and defines a completely bounded linear right m module map denoted iii 7 defines a completely contractive map lcb m m lcb m m m where these are respectively the spaces of completely bounded maps on m and of completely bounded right m module maps on m it was shown in 8 lemma 4 2 that if is a properly outer automorphism of m a m and x x a for x m then 0 now form the element y j j m jy g 0 1 mj x 2 3 and note that y y for each the g 0 coefficient of y is j j m jzmj j j zm jmj z 2 4 using the centrality of z drop to a w convergent subnet of y and follow the proof of 8 theorem 4 3 to conclude that the w limit of this subnet is zg 0 since the other terms of the 5 fourier series tend to 0 using the previous remarks on the map thus zg 0 x so z ig 0 thus p ig 0 since p pz consider now a general element m jg 0 then m m jg 0 and let pn be the spectral projection of m m corresponding to the interval n 1 n 1 choose n so that pn 6 0 for n n since pnm mpn is invertible in pnmpn for n n we may multiply by its inverse to obtain that pn is a projection in jg 0 so lies in ig 0 from above thus mpn ig 0 and we conclude that m ig 0 since limn m mpn 0 this establishes that jg 0 ig 0 completing the proof remark 2 3 in the proof of theorem 6 6 we will need the following fact let mj be the operators in the proof of lemma 2 2 and let be a properly outer automorphism of a von neumann algebra m let a m be fixed then w lim j m ja mj 0 2 5 this is an immediate consequence of 8 lemma 4 2 applied to the completely bounded map x 7 x a since the left hand side of 2 5 is the limit defining 1 we can now give a description of the b closed m bimodules in m g as well as the w closed m bimodules when g has the approximation property ap of haagerup and kraus 21 this result parallels and extends 8 theorem 4 4 using lemma 2 2 in place of 8 theorem 4 3 the argument is essentially the same and so we omit the details theorem 2 4 let a discrete group g act on a von neumann algebra m by properly outer automorphisms i there is a bijective correspondence between sets s zg g g of central projections in m and b closed m bimodules in m g given by s 7 xs span b xzgg x m g g zg s 2 6 ii if g has the ap then the collections of b closed and w closed m bimodules coincide we note here some connections between the results in this section and those of 7 in the analogous setting of von neumann algebras with a cartan masa the two settings overlap in crossed products of the form l x g where is induced by a free ergodic action of g on x in this special case some of the results in 7 principally lemma 2 3 1 and theorem 2 5 1 could in fact be used to give an alternate proof of part i of theorem 2 4 however the techniques in 7 are largely specific to masas so do not apply to more general crossed products on the other hand the corollary of part i of theorem 2 4 stated below is an analogue for crossed products of the equivalence of conditions c and d in theorem 2 5 1 of 7 before giving the full statement we require some terminology definition 2 5 let m n be an inclusion of von neumann algebras a partial isometry v n is said to be a groupoid normalizer of m if vmv v mv m and the set of such elements is denoted by gn m n if in addition the projections vv and v v are central in m then we refer to v as a central groupoid normalizer we denote the set of central groupoid normalizers by gn z m m n and we note that this set is closed under the operations of taking adjoints and products 6 corollary 2 6 let a discrete group g act on a von neumann algebra m by properly outer automorphisms then any b closed m bimodule x m g has the form x spanb x gn z m m m g 2 7 combining this result with part ii of theorem 2 4 we obtain the following characteri zation of w closed bimodules in crossed products by groups with the ap corollary 2 7 let a discrete group g act on a von neumann algebra m by properly outer automorphisms if g has the ap then any w closed m bimodule x m g has the form x spanw x gn z m m m g 2 8 we conclude this section with some observations on the spectral theorem for bimodules of muhly saito and solel 28 if m is a von neumann algebra with separable predual and a cartan masa a m then by the feldman moore theory 17 there exist a standard borel space x a borel equivalence relation r x x with the property that each equivalence class is countable and a 2 cocycle on r such that m is isomorphic to the von neumann algebra m r generated by r and see 17 for details on this construction the von neumann algebra m r is a subalgebra of b l 2 r where is the right counting measure on r associated to denote by the characteristic function of the diagonal subset r x x x x of r then the map a 7 a defines an embedding of m r into l 2 r and the isomorphism of m with m r identifies a with the subalgebra a r of operators a m r such that a is supported on r more generally given a measurable subset s r it is straightforward to check that the set ys a m r a is supported on s m r is a w closed a bimodule in m r in 28 which studied structural properties of w closed subalgebras of von neumann algebras m r with cartan masas it was asserted with the above notations that every w closed a bimodule in m r has the form ys for some s r this statement was termed the spectral theorem for bimodules however the proof given in 28 was flawed as pointed out by aoi in 2 as was a subsequent attempt 26 to repair the proof fulman 18 gave a proof of the result for the special case in which the containing von neumann algebram r is hyperfinite whether the spectral theorem for bimodules holds in full generality remains an open question it was shown in 7 that for a von neumann algebra m with separable predual and a cartan masa a equality of the collections of w closed and b closed a bimodules in m is equivalent to the original statement of the spectral theorem for bimodules in 28 thus in theorem 2 4 part ii above taking m to be l x and to be a free action of a non amenable group g with the ap on x yields the first non hyperfinite class of von neumann algebras for which the spectral theorem for bimodules has been verified to state this result in the original notation of 28 note that in this case l x g is isomorphic to the von neumann algebra m r 1 where r is the orbit equivalence relation for the action and 1 is the trivial cocycle on r denote by the right counting measure on r induced by 7 theorem 2 8 let g be a non amenable group with the ap and a free action of g on a standard probability space x denote by r the orbit equivalence relation for write m l x g m r 1 and let a denote the copy of l x in m if y m is a w closed a bimodule then there is a measurable subset s of r such that y ys a m a is supported on s 3 intermediate von neumann algebras our main objective in this section is to establish theorem 3 3 which characterizes the von neumann algebras lying between m and m g we will require some preliminary re sults that rely on the b topology the next lemma establishes the b continuity of some conditional expectations and automorphisms as well as the relations between them this will be refined in corollary 3 4 lemma 4 3 and corollary 4 5 but these subsequent results cannot be proved at this stage all will be used in section 6 lemma 3 1 let a discrete group g act on a von neumann algebra m by properly outer automorphisms and let em m g m be the faithful normal conditional expectation i let be a automorphism of m g such that m m then 1 em em 3 1 and is b continuous ii let n be a von neumann algebra satisfying m n m g and suppose that there exists a faithful normal conditional expectation en m g n then en is b continuous proof since 1 em is also a normal conditional expectation onto m equality with em follows immediately from uniqueness of the normal conditional expectation suppose that x is a net from m g converging to 0 in the b topology and let m be a normal state on m then using 3 1 for the second equality em x x em x x em x x 3 2 so the limit over is 0 since is a normal state and x 0 in the b topology thus x 0 in the b topology so is b continuous completing the proof of part i now suppose that x 0 in the b topology ofm g since en is a unital completely positive map 10 corollary 2 8 gives en x en x en x x 3 3 so em en x en x em x x 3 4 since em en em apply an arbitrary normal state on m to this inequality to get 0 em en x en x em x x 3 5 and the last term tends to 0 when we take the limit over thus lim en x 0 in the b topology showing that en is b continuous 8 we fix a faithful normal semifinite weight ofm with associated modular automorphism group t t r 37 p 92 as in 19 20 the dual weight on m g is em our use of the modular automorphism groups and dual weights below is inspired by the arguments in 7 to obtain parallel results in the cartan masa context we now consider a von neumann algebra n lying betweenm andm g from lemma 2 2 there exist w closed ideals ig g g such that igg n and if x n has fourier series g g xgg then xg ig for g g let n 0 and n b be respectively the w and b closures of g g igg then n 0 n n b and n 0 is a von neumann algebra while a similar statement for n b is not clear since the adjoint operation is not in general b continuous nevertheless we will show equality of these three spaces recall that a von neumann algebram is said to be countably decomposable if any family of pairwise orthogonal nonzero projections in m is at most countable the term finite is also used 36 definition ii 3 18 theorem 3 2 let a discrete group g act on a von neumann algebra m by properly outer automorphisms and let n be a von neumann algebra lying between m and m g then n 0 n n b and there exists a faithful normal conditional expectation en m g n proof by 36 proposition ii 3 19 a projection p m is countably decomposable if and only if pmp has a faithful normal state a simple maximality argument gives a family p of countably decomposable projections in m with sum 1 and we specify a faithful normal semifinite weight on m by first choosing faithful normal states on p mp for and then defining x p xp x m 3 6 let em be the dual weight onm g for x n p xp p em x p and it follows easily from this that n is semifinite a requirement for quoting 37 theorem ix 4 2 below and which dictated our choice of from 37 theorem x 1 17 t and t agree on m and there exist unitaries ug t m g g t r d g d t in the notation of 37 definition viii 3 4 so that t g gug t g ug t g t r g g 3 7 let ig g g be the ideals defining n 0 and let zg g g be the central projections such that ig mzg each modular automorphism leaves z m pointwise fixed by 37 proposition vi 1 23 so t xzg t xzg t x zg ig x m g g t r 3 8 thus t xzgg t x zg g ug t g igg x m g g t r 3 9 from 3 7 thus t igg igg and equality holds by replacing t by t it follows that t n 0 n 0 for t r and so 37 theorem ix 4 2 see also 35 gives the existence of a 9 normal conditional expectation en 0 m g n 0 satisfying en 0 and which is thus faithful for g g gx g x g x m 3 10 so en 0 g x g x en 0 g gxg 1 en 0 g x m g g 3 11 and it follows that g 1 en 0 g m m g z m thus there exists wg z m so that en 0 g gwg g wg g igg 3 12 consequently g wg zg g wg since en 0 zgg zgg we obtain zg g wg g zgg from 3 12 and hence that g wg zg thus en 0 g zgg so en 0 xg xzgg for x m and g g from lemma 3 1 the b continuity of en 0 gives the formula en 0 g g xgg g g xgzgg 3 13 for each x m g with fourier series g g xgg it follows that the range of en 0 is n b proving that n 0 n n b if a von neumann algebra n lying between m and m g is expressible in terms of a system of central projections zg z m g g by n spanw mzgg g g 3 14 then the requirements of being unital closed and multiplicatively closed lead to three respective conditions that must be satisfied ze 1 3 15 zg g zg 1 g g 3 16 zgh zg g zh g h g 3 17 we thank the referee for pointing out that these conditions are equivalent to the formally stronger ones ze 1 3 18 zg g zg 1 g g 3 19 zgzgh zg g zh g h g 3 20 it is clear that 3 20 implies 3 17 for the reverse we first note that 3 16 and 3 17 imply that g 1 zgzgh g 1 zg 1 g 1 zgh zh 3 21 and so zgzgh g zh thus zgzgh g zh and so zgzgh zg g zh then 3 20 follows from this inequality and 3 17 as we now show the conditions 3 18 3 20 are sufficient for characterizing the intermediate von neumann algebras 10 theorem 3 3 let g be a discrete group acting on a von neumann algebra m by properly outer automorphisms and let n be a linear space satisfying m n m g then n is a von neumann algebra if and only if there exists a set zg z m g g of central projections satisfying the conditions 3 18 3 20 and such that n spanw mzgg g g 3 22 if this is the case then n is b closed and there is a faithful normal conditional expectation en m g n moreover en is given by en x g g xgzgg x m g 3 23 with convergence in the b topology where g g xgg is the fourier series of x proof the necessity of conditions 3 18 3 20 for n to be a von neumann algebra is a matter of simple calculation suppose that n is a von neumann algebra lying between m and m g by lemma 2 2 there exist central projections zg g g such that mzg x m xg n from which it follows that 3 15 3 17 and hence 3 18 3 20 are satisfied if we let n 0 span w mzgg g g then we see by theorem 3 2 that n 0 n n b proving that n has the desired form 3 22 this theorem also establishes that there is a faithful normal conditional expectation en m g n and the formula for en in 3 23 has already been proved in 3 13 noting that n n 0 we can now improve upon lemma 3 1 i corollary 3 4 let g be a discrete group acting on a von neumann algebra m by properly outer automorphisms and let n be a von neumann algebra satisfying m n m g let e n m be the restriction of em to n if is a automorphism of n such that m m then 1 e e 3 24 and is b continuous proof by theorem 3 3 there is a faithful normal conditional expectation en m g n since n m g n this normal expectation is unique by 13 the ore me 1 5 5 a and 3 24 follows the proof that is b continuous is identical to the argument for the corresponding statement in lemma 3 1 remark 3 5 i when m is a factor the central projections of 3 18 3 20 are either 0 or 1 and these conditions easily imply that h g g zg 1 is a subgroup of g thus we recapture the result of 9 23 for separable preduals that the intermediate factors in this case are all of the form m h where h g is a subgroup ii from 3 23 the map xgg 7 xgzgg is a completely positive contraction where the zg s satisfy 3 18 3 20 a simple proof of this would be interesting as we have been unable to establish even the boundedness of this map by direct methods 11 4 central groupoid normalizers let be a properly outer automorphism of a countably decomposable von neumann algebra m connes s noncommutative rokhlin theorem uses 13 theorem 1 2 1 which states that for each nonzero projection q m and 0 there exists a nonzero projection p q such that p p this automorphism induces an action of z on m by n 7 n n z and there is a unitary u m z that normalizes m and implements as x 7 uxu x m the inequality p p is then equivalent to pup we also note that in this situation we have em u 0 see lemma 4 1 below our first objective is to give a slightly more general version of the latter formulation that applies to certain groupoid normalizers of m see definition 2 5 and where we drop the assumption of countable decomposability lemma 4 2 the relevance of groupoid normalizers to the types of problems considered here was established in 6 the most important result of the section is lemma 4 4 which is used in section 6 to show that the natural candidates for the c envelopes of certain operator spaces are indeed the correct ones see lemma 6 4 before proceeding we note that the assumption of countable decomposability in 13 theorem 1 2 1 is unnecessary using 36 prop ii 3 19 any nonzero projection q m dominates a nonzero countably decomposable projection q 1 m and the projection e n q 1 n z is countably decomposable and is invariant then eme is a countably decomposable von neumann algebra on which acts as a properly outer automorphism so the original version of 13 theorem 1 2 1 can be applied to the pair eme q 1 to produce a nonzero projection p q 1 q so that p p the next lemma is an immediate consequence of 12 lemme 1 5 6 and so we omit the proof we thank ami visalter for bringing this to our attention lemma 4 1 let m n be an inclusion of von neumann algebras with a conditional expectation e n m and suppose that m n z m let u n be a unitary normalizer of m and let be the automorphism ad u of m then is properly outer if and only if e u 0 lemma 4 2 letm n be an inclusion of von neumann algebras such thatm n z m and let e n m be a conditional expectation i let v gn z m m n satisfy e v 0 given 0 and a nonzero projection g m there exists a nonzero projection f m so that f g and fvf ii let v 1 vk gnz m m n satisfy e vi 0 1 i k given a nonzero projection g m and elements xi xk m there exists a sequence en n 1 of nonzero projections in m such that g e 1 e 2 and lim n enxivien 0 1 i k 4 1 proof denote by p and q respectively the central projections vv and v v and let m m be the homomorphism x vxv x m then restricts to a isomorphism of mq onto mp similarly the homomorphism x v xv x m restricts to a isomorphism of mp onto mq and is the inverse of 12 if qg 0 then gv vg 0 and so vg 0 then gvg 0 and we may take f to be g thus we may assume that qg 6 0 and replacing g by qg we may also assume that g q we now make a further reduction let z z m be the central support projection of g and let w vz gnz m m n then e w 0 w w zqz z and g z if there exists a nonzero projection f g so that fwf then fvzf and fvzf fvf so fvf thus by replacing v by vz we may further assume that q is the central support projection of g there are three cases to consider case 1 suppose that p q then restricts to a automorphism of mq and this is properly outer by lemma 4 1 since e v 0 by 13 theorem 1 2 1 there exists a nonzero projection f g so that f f 2 since fvf 2 fvfv f f f f f f 2 4 2 we obtain fvf case 2 suppose that q 1 p 6 0 let f gq 1 p since q 1 p is a central projection below the central support q of g we see that f 6 0 and also that f g then fvf fpvf gq 1 p pvf 0 4 3 case 3 suppose that 1 q p 6 0 put f g 1 q p g and observe that f 6 0 since 1 q p is a central projection below the central support q of g then fv f gv v 1 q p v g 1 q p gv 1 q pg 1 q p 0 4 4 since 1 q p q taking adjoints gives fvf 0 these three cases exhaust the possibilities completing the proof of i now consider elements vi gnz m m n with e vi 0 xi m and a projection g m since m is spanned by its unitaries there is no loss of generality in assuming that each xi is a unitary ui m then uivi gn z m m n with e uivi 0 so replacing each vi with uivi allows us to make the further assumption that xi 1 we will construct the nonzero projections en inductively take 2 1 and apply part i with v v 1 to obtain a projection f 1 g with f 1 v 1 f 1 2 1 then apply i again with g and v replaced respectively by f 1 and v 2 to find a projection f 2 f 1 and f 2 v 2 f 2 2 1 continuing in this way we find nonzero projections g f 1 f 2 fk in m so that fivifi 2 1 for 1 i k then take e 1 to be fk and note that e 1 vie 1 2 1 1 i k 4 5 assuming that g e 1 en have been constructed to satisfy ejviej 2 j 1 i k 1 j n 4 6 we repeat the argument with en in place of g and 2 n 1 to find en 1 en satisfying en 1 vien 1 2 n 1 1 i k 4 7 completing the proof of part ii 13 the hypotheses of the following three results have been chosen to be satisfied by the c algebra c x 0 of section 6 see equation 6 1 lemma 4 3 let m n be an inclusion of von neumann algebras with m n z m and let a be a c algebra satisfying m a n i suppose that v a gnz m m n then there exists a central projection z z m such that zv m and e 1 z v 0 for any conditional expectation e a m ii if a is the norm closed span of a gnz m m n and e 1 e 2 a m are conditional expectations then e 1 e 2 iii if a is the norm closed span of a gn z m m n is a automorphism of a such that m m and e a m is a conditional expectation then e 1 e proof let v a gn z m m n by zorn s lemma there exists a central projection z z m that is maximal with respect to the requirement that zv m now let e a m be a conditional expectation let w 1 z v a gn z m m n and put y e w m to arrive at a contradiction suppose that y 6 0 define a homomorphism m m by x wxw x m 4 8 since z 1 w w and z 2 ww are projections in z m we see that restricts to a isomorphism of mz 1 onto mz 2 we have x w wxw w wxz 1 wz 1 x wx x m 4 9 so an application of e gives yx x y x m 4 10 thus y y z m moreover since y e w e w z 2 y z 2 we obtain yy mz 2 mz 2 z m z 2 from 4 10 similarly yz 1 y so the central support projection p z m of y and thus also of y satisfies p z 1 z 2 write y u y for the polar decomposition of y pmp and note that p is both the domain and range projection of u so that uu u u p from 4 10 ux y u y x yx x y x u y x m 4 11 since y z m if we define j t z m p uxt x ut x m 4 12 then j is a w closed ideal in z m p that contains y and thus also its central support p it follows that upx uxp x up x m 4 13 and consequently that ux x u x m 4 14 14 since up u then using 4 14 and the adjoint of 4 10 w ux w x u xw u x m 4 15 so w u m n z m multiply on the right by u m to obtain w p m and so p 1 z v pw m since pw e pw py y 6 0 4 16 we see that p 1 z 6 0 and z p 1 z v m this contradicts the maximality of z so e 1 z v 0 proving part i if e 1 e 2 a m are conditional expectations then the first part shows that they agree on a gnz m m n which spans a norm dense subspace of a thus e 1 e 2 proving part ii since e and 1 e are conditional expectations of a onto m equality follows from part ii establishing the last part of the lemma lemma 4 4 let m n be an inclusion of von neumann algebras with m n z m and let e n m be a faithful conditional expectation let a be a c subalgbra of n generated by m and a subset of gn z m m n if j is a norm closed nonzero ideal in a then m j 6 0 proof let a a j be the quotient map and let j be a positive nonzero element of j by the faithfulness of e e j m is a nonzero positive element so we may multiply j on the left by a suitable element x m to obtain that e xj is a nonzero projection g m since gn z m m n is closed under adjoints and multiplication a has a norm dense subalgebra b whose elements have the form x 0 k i 1 xivi 4 17 where xi m for 0 i k and vi gn z m m n for 1 i k by lemma 4 3 there exist central projections zi z m so that zivi m and e 1 zi vi 0 writing xivi xizivi xi 1 zi vi and combining the xizivi terms with x 0 allow us to assume that we also have e vi 0 in 4 17 we may approximate xj by elements of b so we may choose xi m for 0 i k and vi a gnz m m n for 1 i k with e vi 0 so that xj x 0 k i 1 xivi 1 3 4 18 apply e to this inequality to obtain g x 0 1 3 so xj g k i 1 xivi 2 3 4 19 by lemma 4 2 there are nonzero projections g e 1 e 2 in m such that lim n enxivien 0 1 i k 4 20 15 so there is a sufficiently large choice of n so that k i 1 enxivien 1 3 pre and post multiply by en in 4 19 to obtain the inequality enxjen en 1 4 21 since enxjen j we may apply the quotient map to obtain en 1 however en is a projection so en 0 and en j thus m j 6 0 as required corollary 4 5 let m n be an inclusion of von neumann algebras with m n z m and a faithful conditional expectation em n m let a be a c algebra satisfying m a n and suppose that a is the norm closed span of a gnz m m n if is a automorphism of a such that m m then is b continuous proof let e a m be the restriction of em to a consider a net x in a such that x 0 in the b topology if m is a fixed but arbitrary normal state on m then e x x e x x 1 e x x e x x 4 22 using lemma 4 3 iii for the last equality since the restriction of to m is a normal state it follows that lim e x x lim e x x 0 4 23 thus lim x 0 in the b topology showing that is b continuous 5 norming of crossed products recall from 30 that if we have an inclusion b a of c algebras then b is said to norm a when the following is satisfied for any integer k and matrix x mk a x sup rxc 5 1 where the supremum is taken over row matrices r and column matrices c of length k with entries from b and satisfying c r 1 since rxc a the point of this definition is to reduce the calculation of norms in mk a to that of norms in a and the concept of norming has proved useful in showing complete boundedness of certain types of bounded maps we will use it in this way to prove lemma 6 2 we also recall that a c algebra a acting on a hilbert space h is said to be locally cyclic if given 0 and vectors 1 n h there exist h and a 1 an a such that ai i for 1 i n when h is separable this coincides with having a cyclic vector but is more general when h has higher cardinality we will need one result in this direction as we point out in the proof it is already known for all but one of the various types of von neumann algebras so our objective is to put the previous cases under one general umbrella the hypothesis of a properly outer action seems necessary if g acts trivially on m c 1 then the crossed product is l g which is not normed by c 1 unless g is abelian theorem 5 1 let g be a discrete group acting on a von neumann algebra m by properly outer automorphisms then m norms m g 16 proof the central projections that decompose m into its components of various types are all invariant under the g s so we may reduce to the case where m is type i 1 i ii 1 ii iii or in for 2 n in the first five cases the result is already known see 7 corollary 1 4 9 for type i 1 30 theorem 2 9 for types i ii and iii and 31 remark 2 5 iii for type ii 1 where the argument given is for factors but applies generally without change thus it suffices to consider a type in algebra mn a where a is an abelian von neumann algebra we work first with the special case where g is countable and a is countably decomposable under these assumptions we can fix a faithful normal state on a 36 prop ii 3 19 and we let denote the unital trace on mn whereupon is a faithful normal state on m the center of m is a so the automorphisms g leave a invariant if g denotes the restriction to a of g then we have a second crossed product a g m g suppose that there exists g g e so that g is not properly outer on a then there exists a nonzero projection p a so that g ap id it follows that g leaves mn ap invariant and fixes each element of the center ap by 24 corollary 9 3 5 g is inner on mn ap contradicting the proper outerness of g onm thus each g is properly outer for g g e and so a is a cartan masa in a g let be the faithful normal state on m g defined by em the hilbert space h 0 in the standard representation of a g is the completion of a g with the inner product x y y x x y a g 5 2 in the development of modular theory 24 9 2 see also 34 there is a preclosed conjugate linear map s 0 a g h 0 defined by s 0 x x x a g 5 3 and its closure is denoted s 0 the polar decomposition is s 0 j 0 s 0 s 0 1 2 where j 0 h 0 h 0 is a surjective conjugate linear isometry if we carry out the same construction form g using the state then we obtain a corresponding hilbert space h 1 and operators s 1 and j 1 we may identify h 0 with the subspace of h 1 defined by the operators in in a g and since s 1 h 0 s 0 we see that j 1 h 0 j 0 it follows that j 1 a g j 1 restricted to h 0 is j 0 a g j 0 as noted above a is a cartan masa in a g so by 7 theorem 1 4 7 see also 17 proposition 2 9 1 for the separable predual case a j 0 aj 0 is a masa in b h 0 so is locally cyclic on h 0 30 theorem 2 7 since in is a cyclic vector for mn in its standard representation from it follows that m j 1 aj 1 mn a j 1 aj 1 is locally cyclic on h 1 thus we have found an abelian von neumann algebra b j 1 aj 1 m g so that m b is locally cyclic and so m norms m g by 30 theorem 2 7 for the general case let gf be the countable subgroup of g generated by a finite subset f of g and let ef m g m gf denote the normal conditional expectation if we view the collection f of finite subsets as an upwardly directed net then ik ef x is a uniformly bounded net converging in the b topology to x for x mk m g and k arbitrary moreover by lemma 2 1 convergence also takes place in the w topology then lim supf ik ef x x so a straightforward calculation shows that if m norms each m gf then it also norms m g thus it suffices to assume that g is countable 17 if p a is a countably decomposable projection then so is q g p g g since g is countable and q is g invariant by construction a maximality argument then gives a family q of orthogonal g invariant countably decomposable projections in a that sum to 1 these decompose m g as mq g and the special case above applies to each summand thus m norms m g as required 6 mercer s extension theorem in this section we consider an inclusion m x m g where x is a w closed m bimodule subsequently we will use the notation w to denote the von neumann algebra generated by a set of operators our objective is theorem 6 6 where we show that suitable m bimodule maps on x extend to automorphisms of w x a version of mercer s exten sion theorem 27 in the setting of crossed products we will need two auxiliary sets defined as follows x 0 spanm x gn z m m m g 6 1 the norm closed m linear span of x gnz m m m g and y em xg 1 g x x g g 6 2 the set of elements mg that appear in the fourier series of some x x it follows from lemma 2 2 that y x 0 x 6 3 lemma 6 1 let a discrete group g act on a von neumann algebra m by properly outer automorphisms and let x be a w closed m bimodule satisfying m x m g then w y w x 0 w x 6 4 where x 0 and y are as defined in 6 1 and 6 2 in particular if x generatesm g as a von neumann algebra then this crossed product is also generated by x 0 and by y proof the inclusion w y w x is immediate from the containment 6 3 since m x 6 2 gives that m y and so w y is a von neumann algebra lying between m and m g by theorem 3 2 w y is b closed and so spanb y w y consider an element x g g xgg x then xgg y for each g g from 6 2 and since the fourier series converges in the b topology we conclude that x spanb y w y this shows that w x w y establishing the reverse containment our aim now is to show that certain maps onm bimodules x extend to automorphisms ofw x to this end we say that a map x x is anm bimodule map if the following two conditions are satisfied i the restriction of to m is a automorphism ii for x x and m 1 m 2 m m 1 xm 2 m 1 x m 2 6 5 18 lemma 6 2 let a discrete group g act on a von neumann algebra m by properly outer automorphisms and let x be a w closed m bimodule satisfying m x m g let x x be an isometric surjective m bimodule map then is a complete isometry proof by theorem 5 1 m norms m g the result now follows by using the argument of 29 theorem 1 4 see also 30 theorem 2 10 or 33 theorem 2 1 for earlier versions of this type of result lemma 6 3 let a discrete group g act on a von neumann algebra m by properly outer automorphisms and let x be a w closed m bimodule satisfying m x m g let x 0 be defined as in 6 1 and let x x be an isometric surjective m bimodule map then maps x 0 onto x 0 proof consider a fixed but arbitrary v x gn z m m m g to see that maps x 0 into x 0 it suffices to show that v x gn z m m m g define m m by x vxv for x m let z 1 v v and z 2 vv be central projections in m and observe that is a homomorphism that restricts to a isomorphism of mz 1 onto mz 2 moreover x v vxv v vxz 1 vz 1 x vx x m 6 6 and an application of gives x v v x x m 6 7 replacing x by 1 x leads to v x 1 x v x m 6 8 from which it follows that v v m m g z m 6 9 and that v v 1 x z 2 m g z m z 2 z m 6 10 for 0 1 2 let p be the spectral projection of v v for the interval 1 then p v 1 so 1 p v 1 also 1 p v 2 1 p vv and this last term is a central projection which is consequently 0 otherwise its norm would be 1 thus p v v 0 and it follows that v v is a projection by letting 0 then v v is also a projection and it has already been shown that these elements lie in z m since v x v vx v vxv v v vxv v v x m 6 11 we see that v m v m and a similar calculation shows that v m v m thus v gnz m m m g and it follows that x 0 x 0 the same argument applied to 1 gives 1 x 0 x 0 proving that x 0 x 0 19 recall that a c algebra a is said to be the c envelope of a unital operator space x if there is a completely isometric unital embedding x a so that x generates a and if b is another c algebra with a completely isometric unital embedding x b whose range generates b then there is a homomorphism b a so that which entails surjectivity of every unital operator space has a unique c envelope denoted c env x 3 4 22 lemma 6 4 let a discrete group g act on a von neumann algebra m by properly outer automorphisms and let x be a w closed m bimodule satisfying m x m g let x 0 be defined as in 6 1 then c x 0 is the c envelope of x 0 proof let x 0 c x 0 be the identity embedding and let x 0 c env x 0 be a completely isometric embedding such that x 0 generates c env x 0 by the definition of the c envelope there is a surjective homomorphism c x 0 c env x 0 such that on x 0 letting j ker it suffices to show that j 0 now c x 0 satisfies the hypothesis for the c algebra a in lemma 4 4 so if j 6 0 then j m 6 0 this would imply that m has a nontrivial kernel a contradiction thus j 0 as required the next lemma addresses a technical point that will occur several times in the proof of theorem 6 6 lemma 6 5 let a discrete group g act on a von neumann algebra m by properly outer automorphisms let x be a uniformly bounded net inm converging strongly to x m then b lim x g xg g g 6 12 proof assume that m is faithfully represented on a hilbert space h and let h be a fixed unit vector with associated vector state then lim em xg x g xg x g lim g 1 x x g 1 x x 0 6 13 since automorphisms are strongly continuous on uniformly bounded sets the convex hull of the vector states is norm dense in the set of normal states of m so 6 12 follows from 6 13 we come now to the main result of this section the extension of certain maps on bimod ules to automorphisms of the generated von neumann algebras theorem 6 6 let a discrete group g act on a von neumann algebra m by properly outer automorphisms and let x be a w closed m bimodule satisfying m x m g let x x be a w continuous surjective isometric m bimodule map then there exists a automorphism of w x such that x proof let x 0 be defined as in 6 1 by lemma 6 2 is a complete isometry on x and maps x 0 onto itself using lemma 6 3 by definition of the c envelope which is c x 0 from lemma 6 4 the restriction of to x 0 extends to a automorphism of c x 0 we 20 now extend to a map on w x 0 which we will then prove is a automorphism of this von neumann algebra consider x w x 0 and let k be the norm closed ball in c x 0 of radius x by the kaplansky density theorem x k w by 8 remark 3 3 i the w and b closures of k coincide so there exists a net x from k with limit x in the b topology by lemma 2 1 we also have w lim x x by dropping to a subnet we may further assume that w lim x exists in w x 0 and so we have found a uniformly bounded net x c x 0 such that b lim x w lim x x 6 14 while w lim x exists if x is another such net with these properties then b lim x x 0 so b lim x x 0 from corollary 4 5 which applies since c x 0 satisfies the hypothesis by lemma 2 1 we also have convergence to 0 in the w topology so there is a well defined linear contraction w x 0 w x 0 defined by x w lim x x w x 0 6 15 our next objective is to obtain 6 30 which gives a formula for the g coefficients of x since w x 0 is a von neumann algebra lying between m and m g theorem 3 3 gives a set of central projections zg g g so that w x 0 span w mzgg g g 6 16 let y be defined as in 6 2 and for each g g let kg m be the algebraic ideal given by kg m m mg alg y y mzg 6 17 suppose that there exists g 0 g so that kg 0 w 6 mzg 0 since kg 0 w mpg 0 for some central projection pg 0 z m we see that zg 0 pg 0 kg 0 0 from the definition of y each element in alg y y has a fourier series of finite length and each element appearing in one of these fourier series itself lies in alg y y consequently alg y y g g kgg 6 18 and so for each x alg y y em x g 1 0 zg 0 pg 0 g 1 0 0 6 19 since alg y y is w dense in w x 0 from lemma 6 1 we see that m zg 0 pg 0 em mzg 0 g 0 g 1 0 zg 0 pg 0 g 1 0 0 6 20 implying that pg 0 zg 0 a contradiction thus each kg is w dense in mzg 21 fix g g the ideal kg is also w dense in mzg so has an increasing approximate identity e converging strongly to zg for m m we have me e g c x 0 so multiplicativity of on c x 0 gives me e g me e g m m 6 21 now by lemma 6 5 b lim e g zgg and by dropping to a subnet we may assume that w lim e g zgg then for each lemma 6 5 and 6 21 respectively imply that b lim me e g me g and w lim me e g me zgg 6 22 thus me g me zgg m m 6 23 using the b continuity of on c x 0 lemma 4 5 then lemma 6 5 and 6 23 give respectively b lim me g mzgg and w lim me g mzg zgg 6 24 so by 6 24 and the definition of mzgg mzg zgg m zg zgg m m 6 25 putting m 1 gives zgg zg zgg so 6 25 becomes mzgg m zgg m m 6 26 in exactly the same way we obtain a contractive extension w x 0 w x 0 of 1 x 0 and mzgg 1 m zgg m m 6 27 fix x w x 0 and a uniformly bounded net x c x 0 so that b lim x x and w lim x x 6 28 fix g g and let f be an increasing approximate identity for kg 1 whereupon f zg 1 strongly if x g denotes the g coefficient in the fourier series of x then x g g f em x g 1 g f em x f g 1 w lim em x f g 1 w lim em x 1 f g 1 w lim em x 1 f g 1 em x 1 f zg 1 g 1 6 29 where we have applied lemma 4 3 iii to c x 0 for the fifth equality and used the relation 1 f g 1 f zg 1 g 1 1 f zg 1 g 1 for the last equality now take the limit over to obtain x g x gzg x g g zg 1 w lim x g g f w lim em x 1 f zg 1 g 1 em x 1 zg 1 zg 1 g 1 em x zg 1 g 1 x w x 0 g g 6 30 22 where we have employed 3 19 to replace zg by g zg 1 in the second equality we now use this formula to check the w continuity of by the krein smulian theorem it suffices to consider a uniformly bounded net x from w x 0 such that w lim x 0 and w lim x y w x 0 6 31 and to conclude that y 0 for each g g 6 30 gives em yg 1 w lim em x g 1 w lim x g w lim em x zg 1 g 1 0 6 32 since w lim x 0 thus y 0 and w continuity of is established in the same way is w continuous and id on w x 0 since these relations hold on c x 0 it is then clear that is a automorphism ofw x 0 w x where this equality is lemma 6 1 at this point we have only established that and agree on x 0 and it may be that x 0 is not w dense in x thus the final step of proving equality of these two maps on x requires further argument from corollary 3 4 both and are b continuous onw x so if we define wg zgg and apply to the fourier series x g g ygzgg for an element x w x then we obtain a b convergent series x g g yg wg this gives a second type of fourier expansion for elements of w x suppose that x g g xgzgg x is such that x 6 x then x g g xg wg and let g g ygwg be the corresponding expansion for x x fix h g so that xh wh 6 yhwh since and agree on x 0 we may replace x by x xhzhh whereupon the h term in the expansion of x xhzhh x xh wh is yhwh xh wh 6 0 thus we may assume that xhzh 0 while yhwh 6 0 multiplication on the left by a suitable element of m allows us to assume that yh is a projection p with pwh 6 0 and the h coefficient of x is still 0 the final reduction is to replace p by a central projection from 32 p 61 we may choose partial isometries vi such that i vipv i is the central support projection of p now define x i vi x h 1 v i the w continuity of gives x i vi x h 1 v i and the h term in the expansion of x is i viyh zhh h 1 v i i vip zhh h 1 v i i vip v i zhh i vipv iwh 6 33 noting that the h coefficient of x is 0 we may replace x by x to arrive at the following situation xh 0 while the h term yhwh in the expansion of x is pwh 6 0 where p is a central projection in m let mj be the net of collections of operators from lemma 2 2 and define x j m jx h 1 mj 6 34 23 the h coefficient of x is 0 while the g coefficient for g 6 h is j m jxg gh 1 mj for each of these sums the w limit over is 0 by remark 2 3 since gh 1 is properly outer this is a uniformly bounded net in x so by dropping to a subnet we may assume that it has a w limit which must therefore be 0 thus w lim x 0 since x j m j g g ygwg h 1 mj 6 35 the h term in the expansion of x is j m j pwh h 1 mj j m j p zhh h 1 mj j m jmj p zhh pwh 6 0 6 36 using the w continuity of and the centrality of p zh from this we reach the contra diction that w lim x 6 0 thus x x for all x x completing the proof remark 6 7 i there is a more general version of theorem 6 6 that is easily deduced from it let discrete groups g 1 and g 2 act on a von neumann algebra m by properly outer automorphisms g 1 g 1 g 1 and g 2 g 2 g 2 respectively for i 1 2 let xi be w closed m bimodules satisfying m x 1 m g 1 and m x 2 m g 2 then a w continuous surjective isometric m bimodule map x 1 x 2 extends to a isomorphism w x 1 w x 2 this is obtained by letting g g 1 g 2 act on m m by the product action and applying theorem 6 6 to x x 1 x 2 and the map x 1 x 2 1 x 2 x 1 the resulting automorphism ofw x 1 w x 2 when restricted to w x 1 gives the desired isomorphism ii if the m bimodule x happens to be a subalgebra a m possibly non self adjoint then it follows from theorem 6 6 that the m bimodule maps of this theorem are automati cally algebraic isomorphisms of a references
