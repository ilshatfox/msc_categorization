rank constrained homotopies ar x iv 1 51 1 06 72 3 v 1 m at h o a 2 0 n ov 2 01 5 rank constrained homotopies kaushika de silva abstract for any n k l n let s n k l be the set of all those non negative definite matrices a mn c with l rank a k motivated by applications to c algebra theory we investigate the homotopy properties of continuous maps from a compact hausdorff space x into sets of the form s n k l it is known that for any n if k l is approximately 4 times the covering dimension of x then there is only one homotopy class of maps from x into s n k l i e c x s n k l is path connected in our main theorem we improve this bound by a factor of 8 by combining classical homotopy theory methods with c algebraic techniques we also show that if r s n k l vanishes for all r d then c x s n k l is path connected for any compact hausdorff x with covering dimension not greater than d 1 introduction for n n let mn stand for the n n non negative definite matrices over c and for fixed k l n with n k l define the space s n k l by s n k l b mn l rank b k let s n k l be given the subspace topology induced by the norm topology of mn we focus on homotopy properties of s n k l our main theorem is the following theorem 3 5 let x be a compact hausdorff space x with dimx 2 k l then there is only one homotopy class of functions f x s n k l i e the function space c x s n k l is path connected here by dimx we mean the covering dimension of the space x and m stands for the largest integer which is less than or equal to m r an immediate consequence of theorem 3 5 is that r s n k l 0 r 2 k l 1 the spaces s n k l or rather their homotopy properties have relevance in c algebra theory and our motivation for this study is mainly due to this natural connection for a unital c algebra a let t a denote the tracial state space in other words t a is the set of all normalized positive linear functionals on a which satisfy the trace property ab ba a b a an important object of study for a c algebraist is the space laffb t a of all bounded strictly positive lower semi continuous affine maps on t a for a positive element a in a 7 a limn a 1 n defines a positive lower semi continuous affine map on t a this definition extends to positive elements in mn a n 2 in which case in the right hand side stands for the non normalized canonical extension of to mn a if a is simple a is strictly positive for all a mn a for any n n for sufficiently regular simple c algebras as in 2 13 a a m a is dense in laffb t a 1 http arxiv org abs 1511 06723 v 1 rank constrained homotopies 2 on the other hand density of a a m a laff t a provides one with useful tools to work with to derive classification results and to establish regularity properties such as z stability 3 13 in 13 theorem 3 4 toms shows that for unital simple ash algebras with slow dimension growth a a m a is dense in laffb t a he then uses this fact to show that such algebras are z stable and hence derives classification results the proof of 13 theorem 3 4 heavily depends on homotopy properties of the spaces s n k l 13 section 2 our main result here is an improvement of 13 proposition 2 5 which is a key ingredient in proving that a a m a laff t a is dense for the class of algebras mentioned above however one should note that this improvement does not have a direct impact on the main result of 13 spaces s n k l as a generalization of complex grammarians let us consider the special case k l recall that gk c n stands for the complex grassmann variety of k dimensional subspaces of cn given a k dimensional sub space v of cn one may identify it uniquely with the orthogonal projection of cn on v this identification leads to a natural homeomorphism from gk c n to pk c n where pk c n is the set of all rank k projections in mn c equipped with the norm topology it is not hard to see that the inclusion pk c n s n k k induces a homotopy equivalence hence gk c n is homotopy equivalent to s n k k thus in a sense the spaces s n k l can be viewed as a generalization of the grassmann varieties at least for homotopy interests by setting k l in theorem 3 5 and using the homotopy equivalence of s n k k with gk c n one can derive that gk c n is simply connected i e 1 gk c n 0 for any pair of k n which is a well known classical result however it should be noted that our proof of theorem 3 5 does not in provide a alternate proof of this fact rather we use a stronger classical result in our proof rank varying bundles associated with the spaces s n k l given a continuous map f x gk c n one has the associated locally trivial vector bundle f over x which is the pullback of the canonical k dimensional vector bundle over gk c n to x in a similar vein for each map a c x mn there is a naturally associated bundle in the sense of 7 chapter 2 a over x with the total space ea x v x c n v a x cn and 1 ea x being the natural coordinate projection admittedly a typical bundle obtained in this nature is not necessarily a vector bundle in the classical sense 1 7 in fact such a bundle may not even have a constant fiber still for a bundle a each fiber admits a natural vector space structure which to an extent preserves local triviality moreover these bundles occur naturally in c algebra theory see 14 15 and understanding this association would make the techniques used in section 3 more intuitive thus before moving on to the next section we outline the structure of these bundles rank constrained homotopies 3 the structure of bundles associated with the spaces s n k l observe that if a x s n k k x x then the bundle a is indeed a lo cally trivial vector bundle over x however if a is not of constant rank the associated bundle a is not locally trivial in the usual sense still if we set ei x x rank a x ni then continuity of a implies that the support projection of a is continuous on ei here by support projection of a we mean the function which assigns each x to the orthogonal projection on the subspace a x cn hence the restriction of a to ei denoted by a ei is a locally trivial vector bundle over ei in this manner we can partition x into a finite collection of subsets such that the restriction of a to each subset is a locally trivial bun dle of constant rank one may now consider the possibility of applying classical vector bundle theory 1 7 to establish the structure of a in some local sense i e the structure of a ei for each i but the issue with this is that the subsets ei formed here are highly non regular where as to apply classical theory of vector bun dles the base spaces need to satisfy regularity properties such as compactness we can overcome this if qi the support projection of a on ei extends to a projection pi mn c ei for each i where ei is the closure ei if this is the case then we can apply classical vector bundle theory see 1 7 to understand the structure of bundles pi moreover if its also the case that for any two distinct i j with ei ej 6 the extended projections pi and pj are comparable on ei ej then we can expect to use structural properties of the bundles pi i e local structure of a to establish the global structure of a the above considerations would not hold true for arbitrary a mn c x how ever 15 c f 10 introduces a special class of elements in mn c x called well supported positive elements which are well behaved in the above sense for an element a in this class definition 2 2 each qi extends to pi mn c ei in such a way that for i j with ei ej 6 pi is a sub projection of pj of on ei ej from results in 14 it follows that for any n k l n the set of all well supported positive elements contained in c x s n k l is homotopy equivalent to c x s n k l lemma 3 1 this fact plays a crucial role in the proof of our main theorem in section 2 we briefly recall some well known definitions and results from vector bundle theory 1 7 as well as some other tools and notations that are necessary in section 3 following the ideas from 10 and 13 we prove the main result sec tion 4 theorem 4 6 shows that for any n k l n the path connectedness of c x s n k l depends solely on homotopy of the space s n k l in section 4 we do not assume that k l dimx 2 and the proof of theorem 4 6 is achieved mainly through applications of classical homotopy theory results see 16 to the space s n k l acknowledgments i thank my adviser professor andrew toms for his encourage ment for several helpful conversations and suggestions that were invaluable this work wouldn t have been possible without his efforts i am also thankful to the reviewer of an earlier version of this article for providing thoughtful suggestions comments and references rank constrained homotopies 4 2 notations and preliminaries notations and conventions unless stated otherwise we assume x to be a compact hausdorff space c x y mn m c x mn c x all have the usual meanings and c x c x c we will often identify mn c x with c x mn where mn denotes mn c mn denotes all non negative definite matrices in mn and its customary to call these as positive elements of mn given x mn x denotes the conjugate transpose of x by a projection p in mn we mean a self adjoint idempotent i e p p 2 p note that the notions of the conjugate of an element positive elements and projections carry over to mn c x via point wise defined operations we will use mn c x to denote positive elements in mn c x the base field for all vector spaces and vector bundles that we will consider is the field of complex numbers murray von neumann semi group of c x semi group of isomorphism classes of vector bundles over x and serre swan theorem let p c x m n p mm c x where p mm c x denote the set of all projections in mm c x a pair p p mm c x and q p mn c x are said to be murray von neumann equivalent denoted p q if there is some v mn m c x with p v v and q vv the murray von neumann equivalence class of p p c x is denoted by p 0 and the murray von neumann semigroup of c x is the semigroup d c x p c x where p 0 q 0 p q 0 let bun x denote the set of locally trivial complex vector bundles over x and let bunk x denote the set of all bun x of constant fiber dimension k write vect x to denote the semigroup of all isomorphism classes of bundles in bun x with addition being induced via the direct sum of bundles the well known natural identification of d c x with vect x induced through the serre swan theorem 12 theorem 2 which states that bun x as a category with morphisms being the morphisms of vector bundles is equivalent to the category of finitely generated projective c x modules is central to our study for the sake of completeness and to introduce some of the notations and terms that we will use let us describe this identification for p p mm c x mn c x let p ep 1 x be the bundle over x defined as in the introduction since p is a continuous projection p is a locally trivial vector bundle over x moreover p q for some q p c x if and only if p q this gives a well defined injection d c x vect x which is a semigroup morphism and preserves dimensions on the other hand suppose is a locally trivial vector bundle over x with total space e and the fiber at x x being ex from 12 corollary 5 is a direct summand of a trivial bundle that is there is some n n and a bundle over x such that n where n is the n dimensional product bundle bundle is called a complementary bundle for let f denote the total space of and let fx denote the fiber at x x then we may assume that ex fx c n x x let p x denote the orthogonal rank constrained homotopies 5 projection of cn on the fiber ex c n then the local triviality of ensures that the map x 7 p x is continuous indeed p and thus is a surjection recall that a vector bundle over x is called trivial if is isomorphic to a product bundle over x we say that a projection p in mn c x is a trivial projection if p is trivial where p is defined as before from the preceding paragraph it is clear that if p q mn c x with p q then p is trivial iff q is trivial bounding the dimension of from the preceding for each bun c x there is so that n for some n n we would like to have a bound on the dimension on having such a bound will be useful for our work in section 3 as there we focus on s n k l for a fixed triple n k l let us now address this concern and provide a bound for the dimension of which depends only on the dimension of the base space x recall the following theorem on locally trivial vector bundles over a compact haus dorff space here x stands for the smallest integer n with x n theorem 2 1 let x be a finite dimensional compact hausdorff space let bun x and n denote the product bundle of dimension n let k be the dimension of and write m dimx 2 the following hold 1 k m for some bunm x 2 if k dimx 2 and where is a trivial bundle over x then a proof of theorem 2 1 in the case ofx being a cw complex is given by husemoller 7 chap 9 theorems 1 2 and 1 5 any compact hausdorff spacex of dimension d can be realized as the inverse limit of compact metric spaces x with dim x d for each 9 chap 27 theorem 8 and any compact metric space y is homeomor phic to an inverse limit of finite simplicial complexes of dimension not greater than that of y 9 chap 27 theorem 12 in 6 theorem 2 5 goodearl uses these identifications and husmoller s results 7 chap 9 theorems 1 2 and 1 5 to prove the theorem for arbitrary compact hausdorff spaces one immediate consequence of theorem 2 1 is that given bunk x we may choose a complementary bundle so that the dimension of is at most dimx 2 to observe this first choose some bun x say of dimension t so that k t if t dimx 2 by part 1 of the theorem t dimx 2 for some bun dimx 2 x if dimension of is k 1 then k 1 k dimx 2 dimx 2 and t dimx 2 k t hence by part 2 of theorem 2 1 it follows that k dimx 2 thus for each bunk x we may choose to be of dimension k dimx 2 upshot of all this is that for fixed n k n with n k dimx 2 by following the methods discussed in the preceding subsection we can now construct a bijective correspondence between the isomorphism classes of bunk x and murray von neu mann equivalence classes of projections in pk mn x for convenience let us call this the serre swan correspondence in section 3 we will combine this correspon dence with part 1 of theorem 2 1 to construct continuous maps a x mn which satisfy specified rank constrains rank constrained homotopies 6 well supported positive elements given a mn c x the rank function of a denoted ra is the lower semi continuous function defined on x by x 7 rank a x for a b mn c x if a b mn c x we write a b we now give the definition of a well supported positive element in mn c x given in 15 definition 2 2 let x be a compact hausdorff space and let a mn c x suppose that n 1 n 2 nl denote all the values that ra takes and set ei x x ra x ni we say that a is well supported if for each 1 i l there is a projection pi mn c ei such that limr a x 1 r pi x x ei and pi x pj x whenever x ei ej and i j following theorem can be used to replace arbitrary positive elements by well sup ported ones up to homotopy see lemma 3 1 theorem 2 3 14 theorem 3 9 let x be a compact hausdorff space and let a mn c x then for every 0 there exists a well supported element b mn c x such that b a and a b with the range of rb equal to the range of ra remark 2 4 the theorem stated above is only a part of theorem 3 9 of 14 there in the hypothesis x is assumed to be a finite simplicial complex however the simplicial structure of x is required only for the second part of the theorem which guarantees that each ei corresponding to b as defined in 2 2 can assumed to be a sub complex of x for the theorem as stated here x being compact and hausdorff suffices some useful extension results given a function f on x and a z x we use f z to denote the restriction of f to z let a mn c x be well supported and fix a closed subset y x let q be a trivial projection on y majorized by the support projection of a y in section 3 we would require to extend q to a trivial projection defined on x such that extension is also majorized by the support projection of a to accomplish this we follow ideas developed by toms 15 based on the work of phillips 10 theorem 2 5 10 proposition 4 2 1 let x be a compact hausdorff space of dimension d and let y x be closed let p q mn c x be projections with the property that rank q x d 2 rank p x x x let s 0 mn c y be such that s 0 s 0 q y and s 0 s 0 p y it follows that there is s mn c x such that s s q ss p and s 0 s y corollary 2 6 15 corollary 2 7 ii let x be a compact hausdorff space of dimension d and let e 1 ek be a cover of x by closed sets let q p mn c x and for each i 1 k let pi mn c ei be a projection of constant rank ni assume that n 1 n 2 nk and pi x pj x whenever x ei ej and i j finally suppose that ni rank q d 2 for every i then the following hold rank constrained homotopies 7 if y x is closed q y is trivial and y y q y i y ei pi y then q y can be extended to a projection q on x which is also trivial and satisfies q x i x ei pi x x x the following probably is a well known result but we could not find a direct reference and thus we include a short proof by applying theorem 2 5 corollary 2 7 let x be a compact hausdorff space of dimension d and let y x be closed then any trivial projection r mn c y extends to a trivial projection on x provided that rank r n d 2 proof suppose that the rank of r is k and take q to be any projection in mn of rank k then q represents a trivial projection in mn c x and since r is trivial on y from serre swan correspondence there exists s 0 mn c y such that s 0 s 0 q y and r s 0 s 0 let p be the unit of mn c x then as s 0 s 0 p y and rank q rank p d 2 by theorem 2 5 s 0 extends to s mn c x such that s s q thus r ss is a trivial projection on x with r y s 0 s 0 r remark in the hypothesis of 2 6 its assumed that q is defined on x however 2 7 tell us that the conclusion of 2 6 is valid even when q is defined only on y in section 3 we will use this observation without further mention the final result of this section will not be required in proving theorem 3 5 but we will need this to prove lemma 4 2 which is essential to our proof of the main theorem of section 4 for a mn c x let spec a c a 1 n is not invertible for a mn c x let a x r n be the map given by a x 1 x 2 x n x where 1 x 2 x n x are the eigenvalues of a x proposition 2 8 is a straightforward consequence of the continuity of a on x proposition 2 8 let a mn c x and 0 the map x 7 rank a a x where a denotes the characteristic map on a is lower semi continuous proof it is clear that a is continuous on x for any a mn c x let x x and suppose rank a a x m then there are exactly m with possible repetitions eigenvalues of a x which are grater than moreover as i x are in increasing order n m 1 x n m 2 x n x are exactly the eigenvalues of a x which are greater than set n m 1 x 0 and by continuity of a choose a neighborhood ux of x such that a x a y y ux then for all 1 i n i x i y and therefore by the choice of y ux n m 1 i n i y rank constrained homotopies 8 thus for each y ux rank a a y m rank a a x 3 proof of the main result our first aim is to prove lemma 3 2 which is the main technical result next we prove proposition 3 4 which extends 7 chap 8 theorem 7 2 to compact hausdorff spaces theorem 3 5 follows immediately by combining the two lemmas the following is a direct consequence of theorem 2 3 lemma 3 1 let x be a compact hausdorff space and a mn c x then there exists a continuous path t 7 at in mn c x connecting a 0 a to a 1 where a 1 is well supported in the sense of definition 2 2 and has the same rank values as that of a the path is such that rank at x rank a x t 0 1 x x proof applying theorem 2 3 choose a well supported positive element b a such that b has the same rank values as that of a let at 1 t a tb we only have to verify that rank at x rank a x for every t 0 1 and x x but this is immediate since b a if 0 t 1 1 t a at 1 t a ta a therefore rank at x rank a x t 0 1 x x lemma 3 2 let x be a compact hausdorff space with dim x suppose n k l n are such that k n and k l dimx 2 and let a c x s n k l then there is a continuous path h 0 1 c x s n k l such that h 0 a and h 1 is a trivial projection of rank l proof let x n k l and a be as given in the hypothesis by lemma 3 1 we can clearly assume that a is well supported let the rank values of a be n 1 n 2 nl and let e 1 e 2 el and p 1 p 2 pl be as in definition 2 2 for convenience we will write fi ei and d dimx we first consider the case nl d 2 then choose p mn c x to be any trivial projection of rank l and let h t 1 t a tp now for each t 0 1 x x rank h t x rank a t x rankp nl l d 2 l k and clearly rank h t x l thus we get the required path rank constrained homotopies 9 now let us assume nl d 2 fix r such that nr d 2 and nr 1 d 2 where we allow the possibility r 1 and set n 0 0 f 0 in what proceeds we will construct a trivial projection r mn c x of rank l such that rank r a x k x x once we have such r we define h 0 1 mn c x by h t 1 t a tr t 0 1 then its immediate that this path satisfies the said rank constrains i e remains in side c s n k l we focus on constructing r to this end we first define a trivial projection ql mn c r j l fj such that rank ql nl d 2 and rank a ql x nl x r j l fj we follow an inductive argument to define ql since fr is compact hausdorff with dimfr d and pr mn c fr is a projection of rank nr d 2 using theorem 2 1 1 and serre swan correspondence we find a trivial projection qr mn c fr such that rank qr nr d 2 and qr pr by the requirements for well supportedness of a each pi mn c fi is of constant rank ni and whenever r i j with fi fj 6 3 1 pi x pj x x fi fj also for all j r rank pj rank qr nr rank q 1 d 2 hence we apply 2 6 with x r j l fj y f 1 q qr by the remark following 2 7 q in 2 6 need not be defined on x a priori to extend qr to a trivial projection in mn c r j l fj which is again called qr such that whenever r j qr x pj x x fj then for each r j l rank qr a x nj x fj rank constrained homotopies 10 if r l then we are done defining ql thus let us assume r l suppose that for some r t l we have defined a trivial projection qt mn c r j l fj such that the following hold rank qt nt d 2 3 2 qt x pj x x fj t j l 3 3 rank qt pj nt r j t 3 4 now whenever t 1 j l pj qt ft 1 mn c fi 1 is a projection constant rank nj nt d 2 thus since dimft 1 d by applying 2 1 we choose a trivial projection qt t 1 mn c ft 1 such that rank qt t 1 nt 1 nt and qt t 1 pt 1 qt moreover by applying 2 6 with x t 1 j l fj y ft 1 and q qt t 1 we extend qt t 1 to a trivial projection in mn c t 1 j l fj which we again name qt t 1 such that whenever j t 1 3 5 qt t 1 x pj x qt x x fj set qt 1 qt qt t 1 then since qt qt t 1 are orthogonal trivial projections qt 1 is a trivial projection in mn c t 1 j l fj moreover by 3 2 rank qt 1 nt d 2 nt 1 nt nt 1 d 2 and whenever j t 1 x fj by 3 3 and 3 5 qt 1 x qt x qt t 1 x pj x and finally for each r j t 1 by 3 4 rank qt 1 pj rank qt t 1 rank qt pj nt 1 nt nt nt 1 rank constrained homotopies 11 by proceeding in this manner we construct a trivial projection ql mn c r j l fj of rank nl d 2 such that rank ql pj x nl x fj r j l and ql x pl x x fl choose r 1 mn c x to be any trivial projection of rank nl d 2 which extends ql note that such r 1 exists by corollary 2 7 by the choice of r whenever j r x fj rank r 1 a x nl d 2 d 2 nl thus since r 1 fj ql fj whenever j r we conclude that rank r 1 a x nl x x if nl k then rankr 1 k d 2 l and we choose r to be any trivial sub projection of rank l hence we are left with the case k nl then rank 1 n r 1 n nl d 2 k nl d 2 and we apply theorem 2 1 1 and serre swan for one last time to choose a trivial projection r 2 mn c x of rank k nl with r 2 1 n r 1 now r 1 r 2 is a trivial projection of rank k d 2 and rank r 1 r 2 a x k x x to complete the proof we choose r to be a trivial sub projection of r 1 r 2 of rank l recall the following theorem for locally trivial vector bundles bundles over cw complexes theorem 3 3 7 chp 8 theoreom 7 2 let x be a cw complex and n l be non negative integers then the function that assigns to each homotopy class f x gl c n the isomorphism class of the k dimensional vector bundle f nk over x is a bijection if n l dimx 2 rank constrained homotopies 12 combining 3 3 with lemma 3 2 proves theorem 3 5 for all cw complex the fact that theorem 3 3 extends to the case ofx being compact hausdorff is probably well known however we could not find a clear reference for this in the literature note that since gl c the l dimensional grassmannian over c is the classifying space for l dimensional vector bundles over paracompact spaces if one replaces gl c n by gl c the conclusion of 3 3 holds even for paracompact spaces but the application we have in mind require the target space to be gl c n in proposition 3 4 based on the proof of 6 theorem 2 5 we apply dimension theory results 5 9 and few c algebraic techniques to extend the conclusion of 3 3 to compact hausdorff spaces if a b are c algebras and a b is a homomorphism then for any n n we have an induced homomorphism from mn a to mn b given by aij 7 aij we will use to denote this homomorphism as well for two projections p q mn c x we write p h q if there is a projection valued continuous path in mn c x which connects p and q proposition 3 4 let x be a compact hausdorff space with dim x and sup pose n k n with n k dimx 2 then the isomorphism classes of k dimensional locally trivial complex vector bundles over x are in bijective correspondence with the homotopy classes of maps p x pk c n where pk c n stands for rank k projections in mn c proof let x pk c n stand for the homotopy classes of maps in pk mn c x and let v ectk x denote the set of all isomorphic classes of locally trivial k dimensional vector bundles over x define x pk c n v ectk x by p p p pk mn c x where p is defined as in section 2 since the homotopy equivalence of projections implies murray von neumann equivalence see 8 prop 2 2 7 map is well defined by the discussion in section 2 moreover the discussion following theorem 2 1 shows that is surjective to complete the proof of 3 4 we only have to show that if the vector bundles associated with two projections in pk mn c x are isomorphic then the two projections are homotopic in pk mn c x let us first assume that x is a compact metric space then by 9 chap 27 theorem 8 or 5 chap x sec 10 x is homeomorphic to an inverse limit of finite simplicial complexes x with dimx dimx for each let x x be the canonical induced maps we have the induced homomor phisms t c x c x given by t f f moreover by the inverse limit structure 3 6 t c x c x rank constrained homotopies 13 i e t c x is a sup dense subalgebra of c x note that if then 3 7 t c x t c x and hence t c x is indeed a subalgebra suppose p q mn c x are projections of constant rank k such that the corre sponding vector bundles are isomorphic this means p v v q vv for some v mn c x fix 0 1 3 by 3 6 there is some and v mn c x 1 such that t v v 2 write y x and v v y a v v b v v now a mn c y and moreover by the choice of v it follows that spec a 0 1 1 similarly spec b 0 1 1 let f 0 1 0 1 be the continuous function which vanishes on 0 is equal to 1 on 1 1 and is linear on 1 then f a f b are projections in mn c y with a f a b f b furthermore as a b are murray von neumann equivalent by lemma 3 3 of 4 there is some s 0 mn c y such that f a s 0 s 0 f b s 0 s 0 since y is a closed in x we may choose some open neighborhood u of y so that f a f b extends to projections in mn c u let p q denote these exten sions respectively moreover since f a f b we may choose the extensions in such a way that p q as x is a finite simplicial complex after a finite simplicial refinement of x via barycentric subdivisions choose a sub complex z of x with y z u for convenience let us denote the restrictions of p q to z by p q note that p q generate isomorphic vector bundles over z each of rank k hence form theorem 3 3 and the identification of gk c n with pk c n there is a contin uous path t 7 h t pk mn c z such that h 0 p h 1 q this gives a path t 7 h t pk mn c x given by h t x h t x note that for all x x p x h 0 x p x f a x v v x v v x v v x f a x 2 a x f a x 2 rank constrained homotopies 14 thus p h 0 1 and similarly q h 1 1 therefore from 8 proposition 2 2 4 p h h 0 h h 1 h q this completes the proof for compact metric spaces the proof of the proposition in the case of x being an arbitrary compact hausdorff space follows almost identically in this casex is the inverse limit of compact metric spaces x with dimx dimx for each by the preceding the result holds for each x and now we can argue as in the preceding case theorem 3 5 let x be a compact hausdorff space x with dimx 2 k l there is only one homotopy class of functions f x s n k l i e the function space c x s n k l is path connected proof observe that the case n k is straightforward for any a c x s n k l we have the linear path t 7 1 t a 1 n connecting a to 1 n so we assume n k let a b c x s n k l as dimx k l by applying lemma 3 2 choose trivial projections p q of rank l such that there are paths inside c x s n k l connecting a to p and b to q since n k and k l dimx 2 we get n l dimx 2 therefore as p q are both trivial by proposition 3 4 there is a path inside c x s n k l connecting p and q thus there is a path between a and b in c x s n k l corollary 3 6 for every r 2 k l 1 r s n k l 0 proof follows directly from theorem 3 5 as dimsr r even though we derived the above result as a corollary to theorem 3 5 from a topological view point it might seem more natural and technically easier to first prove the conclusion of 3 6 independently and then apply techniques from homotopy theory and dimension theory to prove theorem 3 5 this is indeed possible and applies in a slightly wider scope in section 4 we show that for compact hausdorff spaces of finite covering dimension the path connectedness of c x s n k l depends solely on homotopy groups r s n k l r dimx we chose not to follow this method for the proof of 3 5 due to two reasons firstly with the techniques we used the proof of lemma 3 2 would not be any simpler if we assumed x to be a sphere instead of a general compact hausdorff spaces secondly if we used such an argument i e proving 3 6 independently and then showing 3 5 it would have avoided the use of proposition 3 4 but we thought 3 4 could be of independent interest for some readers 4 homotopy groups of s n k l and path connectedness of c x s n k l in theorem 4 6 combining well known homotopy theory techniques and classical c algebraic results we prove that for a fixed integer d if r s n k l 0 r d then c x s n k l is path connected for every compact hausdorff space x with dimx d note that in this section we do not assume k l dimx 2 rank constrained homotopies 15 the proof of lemma 4 5 is of the same flavor as that of proposition 3 4 we need few more technical results the following is well known and was used in the proof of 3 4 as well we state it here for convenience proposition 4 1 let x be a finite simplicial complex let y x be closed and u be a open neighborhood of y in x then after a finite simplicial refinement of x there is a sub complex z of x such that y z u lemma 4 2 is a simpler version of 13 lemma 2 1 for the sake of completeness we provide a proof lemma 4 2 13 lemma 2 1 let x be a compact hausdorff space and suppose that a mn c x let l n be such that rank a x l x x then there is some 0 such that for each x x the spectral projection a x has rank at least l proof for each x x let x 1 2 min spec a x 0 note that since l 0 x exists for each x x then rank a x rank x a x x x by proposition 2 8 for each x x the map y 7 rank x a y is lower semi continuous so for each x x there exists an open neighborhood ux of x such that rank x a y rank x a x y ux by compactness of x choose some finite set of points x 1 x 2 xl such that x 1 i l uxi by setting min 1 i l xi 0 for every y uxi we get rank a y rank xi a y rank xi a x rank a x l since x 1 i l uxi this completes the proof let x lim x where x is a inverse system of compact hausdorff spaces and x x be the natural maps in the proof of lemma 4 5 given a c x s n k l mn c x we need to approximate a in norm by elements in t c x s n k l here t is defined as in the proof of proposition 3 4 to achieve this we will use the previous lemma with two other results from c algebra theory first we prove lemma 4 3 which follows as a special case of a well known fact in c algebras for the sake of completeness we include the proof for the special case rank constrained homotopies 16 lemma 4 3 let x lim x for a inverse system of compact hausdorff spaces x let x x be the natural maps and 0 given a mn c x there is some index and some b mn c x such that a t b where t b b proof we may assume a 1 and 1 since a is positive by the functional calculus of a there is some c mn c x such that c 2 a as in the proof of 3 4 pick some and d mn c x such that 4 1 c t d 3 since c is positive c c where c is the conjugate transpose of c then c t d c t d c t d c t d 3 4 2 put b d d then b mn c x and moreover a t b c 2 t d d c 2 t d t d c 2 c t d c t d t d t d c c t d c t d t d the last inequality follows from 4 1 4 2 and the fact that t d 2 for 0 let f 0 1 0 1 be defined by f t max t t 0 1 for any a mn c x let a denote the element f a mn c x given by the functional calculus of a recall that by support projection of d mn c x we mean the function not necessarily continuous which maps x to the orthogonal projection of cn onto d x cn note that the support projection of f a is the spectral projection 1 a to prove 4 5 we need the following proposition proposition 4 4 11 proposition 2 2 let x be compact hausdorff and a b mn c x let 0 and suppose that b a then there exists c mn c x such that a c bc we now prove lemma 4 5 lemma 4 5 suppose for each finite simplicial complex z with dimz d the function space c z s n k l is path connected then for every compact hausdorff space x of covering dimension d space c x s n k l is path connected rank constrained homotopies 17 proof like in the proof of 3 4 we first prove the result for the case of x being a compact metric space in this case x lim x where x is a inverse system finite simplicial complexes with dimx d let x x be the natural maps fixed a c x s n k l our first goal is to show that there is some index and c c x mn such that t c c x s n k l and there is a path in c x s n k l connecting a to t c to do this first note that we may assume a 1 and use lemma 4 2 to pick 0 such that 4 3 rank 2 1 a x l x x by lemma 4 3 pick and b mn c x such that 4 4 a t b let us write a t b note that from proposition 4 4 and 4 4 a d ad for some d mn c x therefore for every x x rank a x rank a x k 4 5 from the functional calculus for a and 4 4 a a a a a a 2 therefore by proposition 4 4 it follows that rank a 2 x rank a x x x now from 4 3 and the discussion preceding proposition 4 4 4 6 rank a x l x x put c t b then c b b a thus by 4 5 and 4 6 c c x s n k l to complete our first goal consider h 0 1 c x s n k l given by h t 1 t a ta we have h 0 a and h 1 c rank constrained homotopies 18 note that a 1 t a ta t a a t 0 1 thus by following the same type of argument we used to show c c x s n k l it follows that h t 1 t a ta c x s n k l t 0 1 the continuity of h can be established using functional calculus arguments see 8 lemma 1 25 first goal is now achieved once when we notice that a is homotopic to a as maps in c x s n k l but this is immediate indeed one can use the linear path t 7 1 t a t a now suppose a b c x s n k l we need to construct a path in c x s n k l joining a to b from the first part w l o g we may assume that a t c b t d for some and c d mn c x put y x x then as x is compact so is y moreover y is closed as each x is hausdorff for each y x rank c y rank c x rank a x hence l rank c y k y y similarly l rank d y k y y therefore as y is closed by lemma 2 7 of 13 there is some open neighborhood u of y in x and c d c u s n k l such that c d are extensions of c d respectively by proposition 4 1 after a refinement of the simplicial structure of x we have a finite sub complex z of x such that y z u hence we may view c d c z s n k l now as z is a finite simplicial complex with dimz d by the hypothesis there is a path g 0 1 c z s n k l such that g 0 c and g 1 d define a path g 0 1 c x mn by g t x g t x by definition of g it is clear that g 0 t c a g 1 t d b and moreover g t c x s n k l this proves the result in the case of x being a compact metric space such that dimx d to get the result for x being compact hausdorff write x lim x where now x is compact metric with dimx d since c x s n k l is path connected for each by the first part of the proof following a similar argument as before give the result note here that the argument is simpler than in the first step since x x is compact metric for any we do not require lemma 2 7 of 13 rank constrained homotopies 19 theorem 4 6 let x be compact hausdorff with dimx d if r s n k l 0 for each r d then c x s n k l is path connected proof from lemma 4 5 it suffices to show that c k s n k l is path connected for every finite simplicial complex k with dimk d we will use induction on the number of simplexes in the complex k to show this if k consists of a single simplex then result is true since k is contractible suppose now that result is true for every simplicial complex which contains r num ber of simplexes to complete the inductive step let k l s where l is a sub complex of k containing r number of simplexes and s is a n simplex for some n d observe that k l is a ndr pair in the sense of 16 since s n k l is locally compact s n k l is compactly generated by 16 diagram 6 3 following sequence is exact in the category of sets with base points 4 7 c l s n k l i c k s n k l p c k l s n k l where k l stands for the quotient space for a space z by c z s n k l we mean the set of all homotopy classes of maps in c z s n k l and as the base point we may choose any constant map z 7 a for a fixed a s n k l the maps i and p are the maps induced by the inclusion i l k and the quotient map p k k l by the induction hypothesis c l s n k l consists of a single point since k l sn and n d by assumption c k l s n k l is also a single ton thus by exactness of 4 7 c k s n k l contains only one point i e c k s n k l is path
