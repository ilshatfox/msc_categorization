dimension no less than 2 we prove that the generator subalgebra in the q gaussian algebra q hr is singular introduction for a real number 1 q 1 and for a given separable real hilbert space hr boz ejko and speicher 3 introduced the q deformed fock space fq hr in order to construct the q commutation relation e f q f e e f id they also studied the q gaussian algebra q hr as the von neumann algebra generated by the q gaussian variables e e e hr in 4 this family of von neumann algebras has attracted lots of attention since as q varies we obtain interesting interpolation between different von neumann algebras the free group factor when q 0 the hyperfinite ii 1 factor when q 1 and l x when q 1 it is known that assuming dimhr 2 these q hr are ii 1 factors 9 non injective 7 strongly solid 1 and for small q we actually get back free group factors 5 one interesting family of subalgebras of q hr is the ones generated by a single q gaussian variable e e for some e hr in e ric ricard s proof 9 of factoriality for q hr these subalgebras played a fundamental role moreover when q 0 those e e are exactly voiculescu s semi circular elements in the free probability theory and those subalgebras are just the generator subalgebra of free group factors this motivates us to call such subalgebras the generator subalgebra of q gaussian algebras the genuine generator subalgebras are long known to be singular and even maximal amenable inside the free group factors 8 thus it is natural to ask whether the same hold for generator subalgebras in q gaussian algebras the problem is that for q 6 0 and e 1 e 2 hr mutually orthogonal e 1 e 1 and e 2 e 2 are no longer freely independent another difficulty in dealing with q fock spaces is that it is hard to control the operator norms of w e n see preliminaries for the notation however as we will see 1 http arxiv org abs 1606 05420 v 2 for generator subalgebras coming from orthogonal vectors the situation is not so far from the free case and the computation is manageable the main result of this paper is theorem for any 1 q 1 and for any separable real hilbert space hr with dimension no less than 2 the generator subalgebras in q gaussian algebras are singular the author strongly believes that the generator subalgebras should be maximal amenable inside q gaussian algebras but he is not able to prove it thus we leave it as a question question are the generator subalgebras of q hr maximal amenable are they disjoint from other maximal amenable subalgebras in the sense of 11 upon finishing writing up this paper the author learned that bikram and mukherjee 2 independently proved among other things similar results for generator subalgebras in q deformed araki woods algebras which contain the main theorem in this paper as a special case their approach to show the mixing property of the generator subalgebra is by proving that the left right measure of the generator subalgebra is lebesgue absolutely continuous the proof essentially boils down to the tracial case and is very similar to ours indeed both the proof of one key ingredient of their paper 2 theorem 5 3 and the proof of theorem 2 in the current paper are strongly motivated by ricard s work 9 acknowledgement the author is grateful to stephen arvsec for bringing the generator subalgebras into his attention during gpots 2015 at purdue he would also like to thank purdue university for the warm hospitality 1 preliminaries let 1 q 1 be a fixed real number and let hr be a separable real hilbert space with dimension no less than 2 denote by h hr r c the complexification of hr define an inner product on n 0 h n by e 1 en f 1 fm q n m sm q e 1 en f 1 f m where sm is the group of permutations on 1 m stands for the number of inversions of h 0 c is the space spanned by the vacuum vector and the inner product on the right hand side is the usual one on the tensor product of hilbert spaces the q deformed fock space fq hr is the completion of n 0 h n q we will simply write to be the norm induced by this inner product 2 for e hr we define the left creation operator e on fq hh by e e and e e 1 en e e 1 en 1 for n 1 e is a bounded operator and its adjoint e is called the left annihilation operator which is given by e 0 and e e 1 en 1 i n q i 1 e ei e 1 e i en 2 for n 1 where e i means a removed letter one can define similarly the right creation and annihilation operators for e hr let w e e e and let q hr be the von neumann algebra generated by w e e hr we call it the q gaussian algebra associated with hr it is known 4 that q hr is a finite von neumann algebra with a separating and cyclic trace vector consequently each element x q hr is uniquely determined by x fq hr and we write x w this notation is consistent with the above definition for w e e hr moreover an easy induction shows that q hr contains all the simple tensors e 1 en h n here we record two facts that will be used in this paper let e h be a unit vector then e n 2 n q 3 where k q 1 qk 1 q and n q 1 q n q wick formula let e 1 en h n then w e 1 en n i 0 sn sn i si q e 1 e n i e n i 1 e n 4 where is the representative of the right coset of sn i si in sn with minimal number of inversions for each coset such a representative is unique thus the above formula is well defined from now on we fix a unit vector e hr and we call the von neumann subalgebra q re q hr a generator subalgebra it is shown by ricard 9 that this gives a maximal abelian subalgebra masa of q hr however we will not need this fact in our proof 3 let t hr hr be a r linear contraction we still denote by t its complexification then the first quantization fq t is the bounded operator on fq hr given by fq t idc n 1 t n the second quantization of t is the unique unital completely positive map q t on q hr given by q t w w fq t in particular if t ee hr re is the orthogonal projection then q ee is the conditional expectation of q hr onto q re 2 singularity of the generator subalgebra q re recall that a von neumann subalgebra a m is called singular if the normalizer of a defined by nm a u u m uau a is contained in a as is well known singularity is closely related to a weakly mixing property we say that for a finite von neumann algebra m a subalgebra a is weakly mixing in m if there exists a sequence of unitaries un in a such that lim n ea aunb ea a unea b 2 0 a b m where x 22 x x for any x m if the above limit equals 0 for any sequence of unitaries un in a which converges to 0 weakly then a is said to be mixing in m clearly for diffuse subalgebras mixing implies weakly mixing and weakly mixing implies singularity see 6 10 we will use this sufficient condition to show the singularity of the generator subalgebra in order to prove that the generator subalgebra is mixing in the q gaussian algebra we will need the following basis criteria from 10 theorem 11 4 1 the statement is slightly stronger than that in 10 but the proof is the same for convenience of the reader as well as for completeness we include the proof here proposition 1 let m be a separable finite von neumann algebra and a m a diffuse subalgebra let y m be a subset whose linear span is 2 dense in l 2 m and vn a is an orthonormal basis for l 2 a if n ea avnb ea a vnea b 2 2 for all a b y then a is mixing in m in particular a is singular in m 4 proof let un n 1 be a sequence of unitaries in a which converges to 0 weakly let a b y be arbitrary elements in y d sup a b and let 0 be fixed by the hypothesis we can find a k such that i k ea avib ea a viea b 2 2 2 since un 0 weakly we can choose an n 0 such that u nvi kd 2 for all 1 i k and for all n n 0 write un i unv i vi then we have ea aunb ea a unea b 2 i unv i ea avib ea a viea b 2 1 i k unv i ea avib ea a viea b 2 i k unv i ea avib ea a viea b 2 5 for n n 0 1 i k unv i ea avib ea a viea b 2 1 i k kd 2 ea avib ea a viea b 2 1 i k kd 2 2 a b vi 2 2 6 on the other hand an easy application of cauchy schwarz inequality gives that i k unv i ea avib ea a viea b 2 i k unv i 2 1 2 i k ea avnb ea a vnea b 2 2 1 2 un 2 7 therefore lim n ea aunb ea a unea b 2 0 a b y noticing that un 1 a density argument then completes the proof 5 the main result of this paper is theorem 2 let q be a real number between 1 1 and let hr be a separable real hilbert space with dimension greater or equal to 2 let e hr be a unit vector and write a q re the generator subalgebra of the q gaussian algebra m q hr suppose that ei 0 i dim hr 1 is an orthonormal basis for hr where e 0 e we write ea the conditional expectation from m onto a which can be obtained via the second quantization of ee define v 0 w 1 vj w e j w e j 2 j n and let y w f 1 fs s 0 ft ei 1 t s m then vj j 0 is an orthonormal basis for l 2 a and span y is dense in l 2 m in the 2 norm such that j ea avjb ea a vjea b 2 2 8 for all a b y consequently a is mixing thus singular in m proof the statements that vj j 0 is an orthonormal basis for l 2 a and that span y is dense in l 2 m in the 2 norm are clear from definitions we just need to show the estimate 8 to this end first note that if either a or b is from a then 8 is trivially true indeed in this case ea avjb ea a vjea b 0 j 0 therefore we can assume that a b m a are of the form a w f 1 fs b w g 1 gt where s t n fk gl ei i 0 1 k s 1 l t and there is some 1 k 0 s 1 l 0 t such that fk 0 gl 0 ei i 1 moreover by the wick formula 4 the form of the annihilation operator and the assumption that ei 0 i dim hr 1 is an orthonormal set we can also assume that for each i 1 the multiplicity of ei in the word form of a is the same as in the word form of b for simplicity we will show the conclusion 8 when b is of the form b w f 1 fm e l where f 1 fm ei i 1 assume also that the multiplicity of e in the word form of a is n n may differ from l the other cases are completely similar 6 for each n 0 let cn ea avn b ea a vnea b 2 2 fq ee aw e n f 1 fm e l 2 w e n 22 9 our goal is to estimate cn when n is large first we apply the wick formula to a note that there are finitely many terms in the expansion thus it suffices to estimate each term also note that each fi 1 i m has to appear in this expansion of a as an annihilation operator in order to get anything non zero under fq ee again for simplicity we consider here only the terms of the form dn 1 w e n 22 fq ee n e f 1 fm w e n f 1 fm e l 2 10 and the rest cases are almost identical next we apply wick formula to w e n inside the above expression for dn dn 1 w e n 22 fq ee n e f 1 fm w e n f 1 fm e l 2 1 w e n 22 fq ee n e f 1 fm n i 0 q n i e i e f 1 fm e l 2 1 w e n 22 fq ee n e f 1 fm l i 0 q n i e i e f 1 fm e l 2 11 where the last equality comes from the orthogonality of ei for each 0 i l we have fq ee n e f 1 fm n i e i e f 1 fm e l ce n n l 2 i 12 therefore if we let dn i 1 w e n 22 fq ee n e f 1 fm q n i e i e f 1 fm e l 2 13 then dn l i 0 dn i now there is an m 1 m 1 l m q 0 such that dn i m 1 sn sn i si 2 w e n 22 fq ee n e f 1 fm e n i f 1 fm e l i 2 14 7 for n e f 1 fm e n i f 1 fm e l i to contribute something non zero in fq re each l fj has to first pass e n i then hit f 1 fm the definition for annihilation operators 2 then implies that there exists an m 2 m 2 m l 0 such that fq ee n e f 1 fm e n i f 1 fm e l i 2 m 2 q 2 n e n n l 2 i 2 15 combining the previous two inequalities we obtain dn i m 1 m 2 q 2 n sn sn i si 2 w e n 22 e n n l 2 i 2 m 1 m 2 q 2 n n n i i 2 n n l 2 i q n q m 1 m 2 q 2 n n 2 i n n l 2 i q n q 16 since q 1 it is then clear that n dn i which implies that n cn the mixing property and the singularity of a in m then follow from proposition 1 remark 3 the reason we use proposition 1 to show the mixing property instead of proving it directly is that the basis we choose may be unbounded in the operator uniform norm hence the density argument may fail note that in the proof of the theorem we never used the fact that a is maximal abelian in fact a being singular and abelian implies that it is maximal abelian thus our proof recovers ricard s results from 9 corollary 4 with the same assumptions as in the previous theorem the generator subal gebra is a masa in the q gaussian algebra corollary 5 for
