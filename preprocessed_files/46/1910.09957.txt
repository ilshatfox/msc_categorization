abstract in this paper we consider several questions emerging from the beurling lax halmos theorem which characterizes the shift invariant subspaces of vector valued hardy spaces the beurling lax halmos theorem states that a backward shift invariant subspace is a model space h h 2 e h 2 e for some inner function our first question calls for a description of the set f in h 2 e such that h e f where e f denotes the smallest backward shift invariant subspace containing the set f in our pursuit of a general solution to this question we are naturally led to take into account a canonical decomposition of operator valued strong l 2 functions this decomposition reduces to the douglas shapiro shields factorization if the flip of the strong l 2 function is of bounded type given a strong l 2 function we define its flip by z z next we ask is every shift invariant subspace the kernel of a possibly un bounded hankel operator as we know the kernel of a hankel operator is shift invariant so the above question is equivalent to seeking a solution to the equation kerh h 2 e where is an inner function satisfying ie almost ev erywhere on the unit circle t and h denotes the hankel operator with symbol consideration of the above question on the structure of shift invariant sub spaces leads us to study and coin a new notion of beurling degree for an inner function we then establish a deep connection between the spectral multiplicity of the model operator i e the truncated backward shift on the corresponding model space and the beurling degree of the corresponding characteristic function at the same time we consider the notion of meromorphic pseudo continuations of bounded type for operator valued functions and then use this notion to study the spectral multiplicity of model operators truncated backward shifts between sep arable complex hilbert spaces in particular we consider the case of multiplicity free more precisely for which characteristic function of the model operator t does it follow that t is multiplicity free i e t has multiplicity 1 we show that if has a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in the complement of the closed unit disk and the adjoint of the flip of is an outer function then t is multiplicity free in the case when the characteristic function of the model operator t has a finite dimensional domain in particular when is an inner matrix function admitting a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in the complement of the closed unit disk we prove that the spectral multiplicity of t can be computed from that of the induced c 0 contraction and as a result the characteristic function is two sided inner finally by using the preceding results we analyze left and right vii viii abstract coprimeness the model

spaces of the hardy space p d lax lax extended the beurling theorem to the case of finite multiplicity and proved the so called beurling lax theorem sub sequently p r halmos ha 1 gave a beautiful proof for the case of infinite mul tiplicity and thus established the so called beurling lax halmos theorem since then the beurling lax halmos theorem has been extended to various settings and extensively applied in connection with model theory system theory and the inter polation problem by many authors cf adr as bh 1 bh 2 bh 3 ca dr hed po ri sfbk in this paper we will focus on a detailed analysis of the beurling lax halmos theorem for infinite multiplicity we obtain answers to several questions emerg ing from the classical beurling lax halmos theorem and establish some new and exciting results including i a canonical decomposition for operator valued l 2 functions in fact for a much bigger class of functions ii the introduction of the beurling degree of an inner function and iii the study of the spectral multiplicity of a model operator let t be the unit circle in the complex plane c throughout this paper whenever we deal with operator valued functions on t we assume that z is a bounded linear operator between separable complex hilbert spaces for almost all z t for a separable complex hilbert space e let se be the shift operator on the e valued hardy space h 2 e i e sef z zf z for each f h 2 e the beurling lax halmos theorem states that every subspace m invariant under se i e a closed subspace of h 2 e such that sef m for all f m is of the form h 2 e where e is a closed subspace of e and is an inner function as usual is an inner function if z is an isometric operator from e into e for almost all z t i e ie a e on t if in addition ie a e on t then is called a two sided inner function there exists an equivalent description of a closed subspace m of h 2 e which is invariant under the backward shift operator s e that is m h h 2 e h 2 e for some inner function the space h is often called a model space or a de branges rovnyak space dr sa sfbk thus for a subset f of h 2 e if e f denotes the smallest s e invariant subspace containing f i e e f s ne f n 0 where denotes the closed linear span then e f h for some inner function now given a backward shift invariant subspace h we may ask 1 2 1 introduction question 1 1 i what is the smallest number of vectors in f satisfying h e f ii more generally we are interested in the problem of describing the set f in h 2 e such that h e f to examine question 1 1 we need to consider possibly unbounded linear op erators defined on the unit circle constructed by arranging the vectors in f as column vectors in other words in what follows we will encounter bounded linear operators whose column vectors are l 2 functions since bounded linear op erators between separable hilbert spaces can be represented as infinite matrices considering the columns of such a matrix as column vectors of the operator seems well justified this approach naturally leads to the notion of operator valued strong l 2 function this notion seems to have been introduced by v peller pe appendix 2 3 for the purpose of defining general symbols of vectorial hankel oper ators however pellers book gives only the definition of a strong l 2 function and does not describe the properties of such functions besides pellers book we have not found any other references in the literature to strong l 2 functions in chapter 3 we study strong l 2 functions including operator valued l 2 and l functions and then derive some basic properties let b d e denote the set of all bounded linear operators between separable complex hilbert spaces d and e a strong l 2 function is a b d e valued function defined almost everywhere on the unit circle t such that x l 2 e for each x d we can easily see that every operator valued lp function p 2 is a strong l 2 function cf p 13 following v peller pe we write l 2 s b d e for the set of strong l 2 functions with values in b d e the set l 2 s b d e constitutes a nice collection of general symbols of vectorial hankel operators see pe similarly we write h 2 s b d e for the set of strong l 2 functions with values in b d e such that x h 2 e for each x d of course h 2 s b d e contains all b d e valued h 2 functions in chapter 3 we study operator valued hardy classes as well as strong l 2 functions as a groundwork of this paper question 1 1 is closely related to a canonical decomposition of strong l 2 functions we first observe that if is an operator valued l function then the kernel of the hankel operator h is shift invariant thus by the beurling lax halmos theorem the kernel of the hankel operator h is of the form h 2 e for some inner function if the kernel of the hankel operator h is trivial take e 0 of course need not be a two sided inner function in fact we can show that if is an operator valued l function and is a two sided inner function then the kernel of the hankel operator h is h 2 e if and only if is expressed in the form 1 1 a where a is an operator valued h function such that and a are right coprime see lemma 4 2 the expression 1 1 is called the canonical douglas shapiro shields factorization of an operator valued l function see dss fb fu 2 in particular fu 2 contains many important applications of the douglas shapiro shields factorization to linear system theory let d be the open unit disk in the complex plane c we recall that a meromor phic function d c is said to be of bounded type or in the nevanlinna class if 1 introduction 3 it is a quotient of two bounded analytic functions a matrix function of bounded type is defined by a matrix valued function whose entries are all of bounded type very recently a systematic study on matrix valued functions of bounded type was undertaken in the research monograph chl 3 it is also known that every matrix valued l function whose adjoint is of bounded type satisfies 1 1 cf ghr in fact if we extend the notion of bounded type for operator valued l functions as we will do in definition 4 18 for a bigger class then we may say that the ex pression 1 1 characterizes the class of l functions whose flips are of bounded type where the flip of is defined by z z from this viewpoint we may ask whether there exists an appropriate decomposition corresponding to gen eral l functions more generally to strong l 2 functions the following problem is the first objective of this paper problem 1 2 find a canonical decomposition of strong l 2 functions to establish a canonical decomposition of strong l 2 functions we need to in troduce new notions this will be done in chapter 4 first of all we coin the notion of complementary factor denoted by c of an inner function with values in b d e this notion is defined by using the kernel of denoted by ker which is defined by the set of vectors f in h 2 e such that f 0 a e on t moreover the kernel of h can be represented by orthogonally adding the complementary factor c to see lemma 4 5 we also employ a notion of degree of non cyclicity on the set of all subsets or vectors of h 2 e which is a complementary notion of degree of cyclicity due to v i vasyunin and n k nikolskii vn the degree of non cyclicity denoted by nc f of subsets f h 2 e is defined by the number 1 2 nc f sup d dim g g h 2 e e f thus in comparison with the degree of cyclicity the degree of non cyclicity admits which is often beneficial when trying to understand the beurling lax halmos theorem now for a canonical decomposition of strong l 2 functions we are tempted to guess that can be factored as a where is a possibly one sided inner function as in the douglas shapiro shields factorization in which is two sided inner but this is not the case in fact we can see that a canonical decomposition is actually affected by the kernel of through some examples see p 45 upon reflection we recognize that this is not an accident this is accomplished in chapter 5 theorem 5 1 realizes the idea inside those examples if is a strong l 2 function with values in b d e then can be expressed in the form 1 3 a b where is an inner function with values in b e e and a are right coprime b 0 and nc dime denotes the set of all column vectors of the analytic part of in particular if dime for instance if dime then the expression 1 3 is unique up to a unitary constant right factor see theorem 5 1 p 46 the expression 1 3 will be called a canonical decomposition of a strong l 2 function the proof of theorem 5 1 shows that the inner function in the canonical decomposition 1 3 of a strong l 2 function can be obtained from the equation kerh h 2 e 4 1 introduction which is guaranteed by the beurling lax halmos theorem see corollary 4 4 in this case the expression 1 3 will be called the blh canonical decomposition of recalling that comes from the beurling lax halmos theorem however if dime even in the case when dimd then it is possible to get another inner function of a canonical decomposition 1 3 for the same function in this case kerh 6 h 2 e therefore the canonical decomposition of a strong l 2 function is not unique in general see remark 5 2 but the second assertion of theorem 5 1 says that if the codomain of z is finite dimensional in particular if is a matrix valued l 2 function then the canonical decomposition 1 3 of is unique in other words the inner function in 1 3 should be obtained from the equation kerh h 2 e thus the unique canonical decomposition 1 3 of matrix valued l 2 functions is precisely the blh canonical decomposition further if the flip of is of bounded type then b turns to be a zero function so that the decomposition 1 3 reduces to the douglas shapiro shields factoriza tion in fact the douglas shapiro shields factorization was given for l functions but the case b 0 in 1 3 is available for strong l 2 functions moreover the no tion of bounded type for matrix valued functions is not appropriate for operator valued functions i e the statement each entry of the matrix is of bounded type does not produce a natural extension to operator valued functions even though it has a meaning for infinite matrices remember that we deal with operators between separable hilbert spaces thus we need to introduce an appropriate notion of bounded type for operator valued functions we will do this in section 4 4 moreover to guarantee the statement each entry is of bounded type we adopt the notion of meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de z 1 z which coincides with the notion of bounded type for matrix valued functions cf fu 1 this will be done in section 4 5 on the other hand we recall that the spectral multiplicity for a bounded linear operator t acting on a separable complex hilbert space e is defined by the number t t inf dimf where f e the infimum being taken over all generating subspaces f i e sub spaces such that mf t nf n 0 e in the definition of the spectral multiplicity f may be taken as a subset rather than a subspace in this case we may regard t as the quantity inf dim f f f such that mf e unless this leads to ambiguity we will deal with mf for subsets f e if se is the shift operator on h 2 e then it is known that se dime by contrast if s e is the backward shift operator on h 2 e then s e has a cyclic vector i e s e 1 moreover the cyclic vectors of s e form a dense subset of h 2 e see ha 4 ni 1 wo we here observe that question 1 1 i is identical to the problem of finding the spectral multiplicity of the truncated backward shift operator s e h i e the restriction of s e to its invariant subspaceh the second objective of this paper is to show that this problem has a deep connection with a canonical decomposition of strong l 2 functions involved with the inner function to understand the smallest s e invariant subspace containing a subset f h 2 e we need to consider the kernels of the adjoints of unbounded hankel operators with strong l 2 symbols involved with f thus we will deal with unbounded hankel operators h with strong l 2 symbols however the adjoint of the unbounded 1 introduction 5 hankel operator need not be a hankel operator but if is an l function then h h where is the flip of thus for a bounded symbol we may use the notations h and h interchangeably by contrast for a strong l 2 function h may not be equal to h even though is a strong l 2 function in particular the kernel of an unbounded hankel operator h is likely to be trivial because it is defined on the dense subset of polynomials from this viewpoint to avoid potential technical issues in our arguments we will deal with the operatorh in place ofh in spite of this and since the kernel of the adjoint of an unbounded operator is always closed we can show that via the beurling lax halmos theorem the kernel of h with strong l 2 symbol is still of the form h 2 e see corollary 4 4 we now consider several questions which are of independent interest this will be done in chapter 4 the next question arises naturally from the beurling lax halmos theorem question 1 3 since the kernel of the hankel operatorh is of the form h 2 e which property of determines the dimension of the space e in particular if is an n m matrix valued l 2 function and dime r which property of determines the number r to answer question 1 3 we employ the notion of degree of non cyclicity 1 2 indeed we can show that if the kernel of the adjoint of the hankel operator h is h 2 e for some inner function then the dimension of e can be computed by the degree of non cyclicity of see theorem 4 10 here we note that the definition of depends on the orthonormal bases of the domain d of however the degree of non cyclicity of is independent of the particular choice of orthonormal basis of d see theorem 4 10 when is an inner function we may ask when it is possible to complement to a two sided inner function by aid of an inner function in other words when is a two sided inner function where is understood as an 1 2 operator matrix defined on the unit circle t it turns out that this question can be answered by using the complementing lemma see vn or ni 1 the following question refers to more general cases question 1 4 if is an n r inner matrix function which condition on allows us to complement to an n r q inner matrix function using an n q inner matrix function an answer to question 1 4 is also subject to the degree of non cyclicity of see corollary 4 16 by the beurling lax halmos theorem we saw that the kernel of the adjoint of a hankel operator with a strong l 2 symbol is of the form h 2 e for some inner function in view of its converse we may ask question 1 5 is every shift invariant subspace h 2 e represented by the ker nel of h with some strong l 2 symbol with values in b d e question 1 5 asks whether a strong l 2 solution always exists for the equation kerh h 2 e for a given inner function in theorem 6 1 we give an affirmative answer to question 1 5 the matrix valued version of this result is as follows see corollary 6 2 for a given n r inner matrix function there always exists a 6 1 introduction solution l mn m of the equation kerh h 2 cr for some m r 1 in view of this it is reasonable to ask whether such a solution l 2 mn m exists for each m 1 2 but the answer to this question is negative see remark 6 4 it is then natural to ask how to determine a possible dimension of d for which there exists a strong l 2 solution with values in b d e of the equa tion kerh h 2 e in fact we would like to ask what is the infimum of dimd that guarantees the existence of a strong l 2 solution to find a way to deter mine such an infimum we introduce the notion of beurling degree for an inner function we do this by employing the canonical decomposition of a strong l 2 function induced by the given inner function if is an inner function with values in b e e then the beurling degree denoted by degb of is defined by the infimum of the dimension of the nonzero space d for which there exists a pair a b such that a b is a canonical decomposition of a strong l 2 function with values in b d e definition 6 5 we now recall that the model theorem ni 1 sfbk states that if a bounded operator t acting on a hilbert space h in symbols t b h is a contraction i e t 1 satisfying 1 4 lim n t nx 0 for each x h then t is unitarily equivalent to a truncated backward shift s e h for some inner function with values in b e e where e cl ran i t t in this case s e h is called the the model operator of t and is called the characteristic function of t we often write t c 0 for a contraction operator t b h satisfying the condition 1 4 we can now prove that if is the characteristic function of the model operator t with values in b e e with dime in particular when is an inner matrix function then the spectral multiplicity of the model operator is equal to the beurling degree of equivalently given an inner function with values in b e e with dime let t s e h then 1 5 t degb see theorem 6 6 the equality 1 5 is the second objective of this paper it is somewhat surprising that the spectral multiplicity of the model operator can be computed by a function theoretic property of the corresponding characteristic function the third objective of this paper is to consider the case of t 1 i e when the operator t has a cyclic vector in general if t b h is such that t 1 then t is said to be multiplicity free to avoid confusion we regard t to be multiplicity free if the operator t acts on the zero space thus we are interested in the following question on the characteristic function of t question 1 6 let t s e h for which inner function does it follow that t is multiplicity free to get an answer to question 1 6 we consider the notion of characteristic scalar inner function which is a generalization of the case of two sided inner matrix function and we often call it square inner matrix function cf hel sfbk chl 3 this will be done in section 7 1 if is an inner function and c is its complementary factor we write cc c c ccc cc c etc for 1 introduction 7 the successive iterated complementary factors of the key idea for an answer to question 1 6 is given in the following result first let z z if an inner function has a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de and if is an outer function then cc see lemma 7 13 we can then get an answer to question 1 6 as follows if t s e h where has a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de and is an outer function then t is multiplicity free see theorem 7 14 recall that for an inner matrix function the condition has a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de is equivalent to the condition is of bounded type see corollary 4 27 as a consequence the matrix valued version of theorem 7 14 can be rephrased as follows if is an inner matrix function whose flip is of bounded type and if t the transpose of is an outer function then t s e h is multiplicity fee see corollary 7 15 we may ask whether the converse of the key idea lemma 7 13 for theorem 7 14 is true i e if is an inner function having a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de and cc does it follow that is an outer function we can show that the answer to this question is affirmative when is an inner matrix function i e if cc then is an outer function when is an inner matrix function whose flip is of bounded type see corollary 7 16 on the other hand the theory of spectral multiplicity for c 0 operators has been well developed in terms of their characteristic functions cf ni 1 appendix 1 however this theory is not applied directly to c 0 operators in which cases their characteristic functions need not be two sided inner the fourth objective of this paper is to show that if the characteristic function of a c 0 operator t has a finite dimensional domain and a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de then its spectral multiplicity can be computed by that of the c 0 operator induced by t this will be done in section 7 3 the main theorem of that section is as follows given an inner function with values in b e e with dim e let t s e h if has a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de then 1 6 t ts where ts is a c 0 contraction of the form ts s e h s with s i hence in particular t dim e here i means the inner part of the inner outer factorization of the given h function see theorem 7 24 in theorem 7 24 we note that s i is a two sided inner function see lemma 7 21 and hence ts belongs to the class c 0 therefore 1 6 shows that the spectral multiplicity of a c 0 operator can be determined by the induced c 0 operator if its characteristic function has a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de on the other hand it was known cf ni 1 p 41 that if t s e h for an inner function with values in b e e with dim e dim e then 1 7 t dim e 1 8 1 introduction if further dim e dim e then 1 8 t dim e thus the equation 1 6 shows that 1 8 still holds without the assumption dim e dim e the organization of this paper is as follows the main theorems of this paper are theorem 5 1 a canonical decomposition of strong l 2 functions theorem 6 6 the beurling degree and the spectral multiplicity theorem 7 14 multiplicity free model operators and theorem 7 24 the spectral multiplicity of model operators to prove those theorems we need to consider several questions emerging from the beurling lax halmos theorem we also consider several auxiliary lemmas and new notions of complementary factors of inner functions the degree of non cyclicity bounded type strong l 2 functions and the beurling degree of an inner function in chapter 2 we give the notations and the basic definitions in chapter 3 we study operator valued strong l 2 functions and then prove some properties which will be used in the sequel in section 4 1 4 3 we introduce notions of complementary factors of inner functions and the degree of non cyclicity and then give answers to question 1 3 and question 1 4 in section 4 4 we introduce the notion of bounded type strong l 2 functions which correspond to the functions whose entries are of bounded type in the matrix valued case in chapter 5 we establish a canonical decomposition of a strong l 2 functions which reduces to the douglas shapiro shields factorization of if is of bounded type in chapter 6 we give an answer to question 1 5 and then establish a con nection between the spectral multiplicity of the model operator and the beurling degree of the corresponding characteristic function in chapter 7 we consider the spectral multiplicity of model operators by using the notion of meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in the complement of the closed unit disk and then give an answer to question 1 6 in chapter 8 by using the preceding results we analyze the left and right coprimeness the model operator and an interpolation problem for operator valued functions in chapter 9 we address some unsolved problems chapter 2 preliminaries in this chapter we provide notations and definitions which will be used in this paper we write d for the open unit disk in the complex plane c and t for the unit circle in c to avoid a confusion we will write z for points on t and for points in c t for l 2 write z z and z z for l 2 write p and p where p and p are the orthogonal projections from l 2 onto h 2 and l 2 h 2 respectively thus we may write throughout the paper we assume that x and y are complex banach spaces d and e are separable complex hilbert spaces we write b x y for the set of all bounded linear operators from x to y and abbreviate b x x to b x for a complex banach space x we write x for its dual we write mn m for the set of n m complex matrices and abbreviate mn n tomn we also write g c d and l c m denote the greatest common inner divisor and the least common inner multiple respectively while left g c d and left l c m denote the greatest common left inner divisor and the least common left inner multiple respectively if a d e is a linear operator whose domain is a subspace of d then a is also a linear operator from the closure of the domain of a into e so we will only consider those a such that the domain of a is dense in d such an operator a is said to be densely defined if a d e is densely defined we write doma kera and rana for the domain the kernel and the range of a respectively if a d e is densely defined write doma e e ad e is a bounded linear functional for all d doma then there exists a unique f e such that ad e d f for all d doma denote this unique vector f by f a e thus ad e d a e for all d doma and e doma we call a the adjoint of a it is well known from unbounded operator theory cf go con that if a is densely defined then kera rana so that kera is closed even though kera may not be closed we recall ab co 2 ghr ni 1 that a meromorphic function d c is said to be of bounded type or in the nevanlinna class n if there are functions 9 10 2 preliminaries 1 2 h such that z 1 z 2 z for almost all z t it is well known that is of bounded type if and only if 1 2 for some i hp p 0 i 1 2 if 2 i e is the inner outer factorization of 2 then i 1 e thus if l 2 is of bounded type then can be written as a where is inner a h 2 and and a are coprime write de z 1 z for a function g de c define a function gd d c by gd g 1 d for a function g de c we say that g belongs tohp de if gd hp 1 p a function g de c is said to be of bounded type if gd is of bounded type if f h 2 then the function f defined in de is called a pseudo continuation of f if f is a function of bounded type and f z f z for almost all z t cf bb ni 1 sh then we can easily show that f is of bounded type if and only if f has a pseudo continuation f in this case f d z f z for almost all z t in particular 2 1 l 2 is of bounded type has a pseudo continuation we review here a few essential facts concerning vector valued lp and hp functions that we will used to begin with using ds du ff hp ho ni 1 ni 2 pe sa as general references let m be a positive finite measure space and x be a complex banach space a function f x of the form f k 1 xk k where xk x k m and k j for k 6 j is said to be countable valued a function f x is called weakly measurable if the map s 7 f s is measurable for all x and is called strongly measurable if there exist countable valued functions fn such that f s limn fn s for almost all s it is known that when x is separable i if f is weakly measurable then f is measurable ii f is strongly measurable if and only if it is weakly measurable a countable valued function f k 1 xk k is called bochner integrable if f s d s and its integral is defined by fd k 1 xk k a function g x is called integrable if there exist countable valued integrable functions gn such that g s limn gn s for almost all s and limn g gn d 0 then gd limn gnd exists and gd is called the bochner integral of g if f x is integrable then we can see that 2 2 t fd tf d for each t b x y 2 preliminaries 11 letm denote the normalized lebesgue measure on t for a complex banach space x and 1 p let l p x l p t x f t x f is strongly measurable and f p where f p f lp x t f z pxdm z 1 p 1 p ess supz t f z x p then we can see that l p x forms a banach space for f l 1 x the n th fourier coefficient of f denoted by f n is defined by f n t znf z dm z for each n z also h p x hp t x is defined by the set of f lp x with f n 0 for n 0 a function f d x is norm analytic if f can be written as f n 0 xn n d xn x let hol d x denote the set of all analytic functions f d x also we write h 2 d x for the set of all f hol d x satisfying f h 2 d x sup 0 r 1 t f rz 2 xdm z 1 2 let e be a separable complex hilbert space as in the scalar valued case if f h 2 d e then there exists a boundary function bf h 2 e such that f rz bf pr z r 0 1 and z t where pr denotes the poisson kernel and bf z lim rz z f rz nontangentially a e on t moreover the mapping f 7 bf is an isometric bijection cf ni 2 theorem 3 11 7 we conventionally identify h 2 d e with h 2 e h 2 t e for f g l 2 e with a separable complex hilbert space e the inner product f g is defined by f g f z g z l 2 e t f z g z e dm z if f g l 2 x with x mn m then f g t tr g f dm for a function t b d e write z z for z t a function t b x y is called sot measurable if z 7 z x is strongly measurable for every x x and is called wot measurable if z 7 z x is weakly measurable for every x x we can easily check that if t b x y is strongly measurable then is sot measurable and if d and e are separable complex hilbert spaces then t b d e is sot measurable if and only if is wot measurable we then have lemma 2 1 if t b d e is wot measurable then so is 12 2 preliminaries proof suppose that is wot measurable then the function z 7 z y x x z y z x y is measurable for all x d and y e thus the function z 7 z y x is measurable for all x d and y e let t b d e be a wot measurable function then is called wot integrable if x y l 1 for every x d and y

b d e is sot integrable then it follows from 2 2 that for every x d and y e 2 3 t z xdm z y t z x y dm z which implies that is wot integrable and that the sot integral of is equal to the wot integral of we can say more lemma 2 2 for l 1 b d e the bochner integral of is equal to the sot integral of in the sense that t z dm z x t z xdm z for all x d proof this follows from a straightforward calculation chapter 3 strong l 2 functions to examine question 1 1 we need to consider operator valued functions defined on the unit circle constructed by arranging the vectors in f as their column vectors using this viewpoint we will consider operator valued functions whose column vectors are l 2 functions note that bounded linear operators between separable hilbert spaces may be represented as infinite matrices so that column vectors of operators are well justified this viewpoint leads us to define operator valued strong l 2 functions in this chapter we consider strong l 2 functions and then derive some of their properties the terminology of a strong h 2 function is reserved for the operator valued functions on the unit disk d following to n k nikolskii ni 1 a function d b d e is called a strong h 2 function if x h 2 d e for each x d to describe this in detail and to explain the crucial role that strong l 2 functions play in our theory we need to introduce some additional notation and terminology let l b d e be the space of all bounded wot measurable b d e valued functions on t for l b d e define ess supz t z for 1 p we define the class lps b d e lps t b d e as the set of all wot measurable b d e valued functions on t such that x lpe a function lps b d e is called a strong lp function we claim that 3 1 l p b d e l p s b d e indeed if lpb d e then for all x d with x 1 z x p l p e t z x pedm z t z pb d e dm z p l p b d e which gives 3 1 also we can easily check that 3 2 l b d e l b d e lps b d e remark 3 1 we may define a norm on lps b d e i e s p sup z x lp e x d with x 1 then lps b d e forms a normed space for 1 p moreover we can show that s p is a complete norm for 1 p i e lps b d e is a banach 13 14 3 strong l 2 functions space for 1 p however in general we cannot guarantee that s p lp b d e to see this let c be the upper unit circle and 1 p put c 0 0 1 c then z 1 for all z t so that lp m 2 1 let x t be a unit vector in c 2 then we have that z x p l p c 2 t c 1 c t pdm z 1 2 p p 1 2 which gives s p 6 lp m 2 if l 1 s b d e and x d then x l 1 e thus the n th fourier coefficient x n of x is given by x n t zn z x dm z we now define the n th fourier coefficient of l 1 s b d e denoted by n by n x x n n z x d we define h 2 s b d e h 2 s t b d e l 2 s b d e n 0 for n 0 or equivalently h 2 s b d e is the set of all wot measurable functions on t such that x h 2 e for each x d we also define h b d e h t b d e l b d e n 0 for n 0 on the other hand we define h d b d e as the set of all analytic functions d b d e satisfying h sup d ifd and e are separable hilbert spaces we conventionally identifyh d b d e with h t b d e cf ni 2 theorem 3 11 10 on the other hand by 3 1 we have l 1 b d e l 1 s b d e thus if l 1 b d e then there are two definitions of the n th fourier coefficient of however we can by lemma 2 2 see that the n th fourier coefficient of as an element of l 1 b d e coincides with the n th fourier coefficient of as an element of l 1 s b d e we now denote byh 2 s d b d e the set of all strongh 2 functions with values in b d e we then have lemma 3 2 h 2 d b d e h 2 s d b d e 3 strong l 2 functions 15 proof let h 2 d b d e then can be written as n 0 an n an b d e thus for each x d x n 0 anx n hol d e observe that x 2 h 2 d e sup 0 r 1 t rz x 2 edm z 2 h 2 d b d e x 2 d which implies h 2 s d b d e theorem 3 3 if dimd then h 2 d b d e h 2 s d b d e where the equality is set theoretic proof by lemma 3 2 we have h 2 d b d e h 2 s d b d e for the reverse inclusion suppose h 2 s d b d e and dimd d let ej j 1 2 d be an orthonormal basis of d then for each j 1 2 d 3 3 j ej h 2 d e thus we may write j n 0 a j n n a j n e for each n 0 1 2 define an d e by anx d j 1 ja j n where x d j 1 jej then an b d e we claim that 3 4 n 0 an n hol d b d e to prove 3 4 let 0 be arbitrary for each d there exists m 0 such that for all j 1 2 d n m a j n n e d 16 3 strong l 2 functions let x d j 1 jej with x d 1 then we have m 1 n 0 an n x e n m d j 1 ja j n n e d j 1 n m a j n n e which proves 3 4 for all r 0 1 we have that rz x 2 e d j 1 j rz ej 2 e d j 1 j rz ej e 2 d j 1 rz ej 2 e thus rz 2 b d e d j 1 rz ej 2 e and hence it follows from 3 3 that h 2 d b d e sup 0 r 1 t rz 2 b d e dm z sup 0 r 1 t d j 1 rz ej 2 edm z d j 1 j 2 h 2 d e which implies h 2 d b d e this completes the proof remark 3 4 theorem 3 3 may fail if the condition dimd is dropped for example if is defined on the unit disk d by 2 3 2 c d then is a bounded linear operator for each d indeed b 2 c sup x 1 x sup x 1 n 1 nxn x xn 2 sup x 1 2 3 x 1 x 2 x 3 2 3 2 2 1 2 1 2 3 strong l 2 functions 17 moreover for each x xn 2 x n 1 xn n h 2 d c which says that h 2 s d b 2 c however we have h 2 d b 2 c indeed for rz d 2 b 2 c b 2 c r 2 1 r 2 so that sup 0 r 1 t rz 2 b 2 c dm z sup 0 r 1 t r 2 1 r 2 dm z sup 0 r 1 r 2 1 r 2 in general the boundary values of strong h 2 functions do not need to be bounded linear operators defined almost everywhere on t thus we do not guar antee that the boundary value of a strong h 2 function belongs to h 2 s t b d e for example if is defined on the unit disk d by 1 2 3 2 c d then by remark 3 4 is a strong h 2 function with values in b 2 c however the boundary value z 1 z z 2 z 3 2 c z t is not bounded for all z t because for any z 0 t if we let x 0 1 z 0 z 20 2 z 30 3 t 2 then z 0 x 0 1 n 1 1 n which shows that h 2 s t b d e in spite of it there are useful relations between the set h 2 s d b d e and the set h 2 s t b d e to see this let h 2 s t b d e then z b d e for almost all z t and z x h 2 e for each x d we now define a function valued with domain d function p on the unit disk d by the poisson integral in the strong sense p rei x x pr ei x d 2 0 pr t eit x dm t e where pr is the poisson kernel then p x h 2 d e thus for all d p can be viewed as a function from d into e a straightforward calculation shows that p is a linear map for each d since p x h 2 d e is the poisson integral of z x h 2 e we will conventionally identify z x and p x 18 3 strong l 2 functions for each x d from this viewpoint we will also regard h 2 s t b d e as an linear but not necessarily bounded operator valued function defined on the unit disk d we thus have lemma 3 5 the following inclusion holds h 2 b d e h b d e h 2 s d b d e proof note that by 3 1 and 3 2 h 2 b d e h b d e h 2 s t b d e thus in view of the preceding remark it suffices to show b d e for all d to see this we first claim that there exists m 0 such that 3 5 sup x l 1 e x d with x 1 m to see this if h 2 b d e then for all x d with x 1 x l 1 e x l 2 e t z 2 b d e dm z 1 2 l 2 b d e if instead h b d e then for all x d with x 1 x l 1 e t z x edm z z which proves the claim 3 5 now let rei d and x d with x 1 then for y e with y 1 rei x y e 2 0 pr t eit xdm t y e 2 0 pr t eit x y e dm t by 2 3 1 r 1 r 2 0 eit x y e dm t which implies by our assumption x e 1 r 1 r 2 0 eit x e dm t 1 r 1 r x l 1 e which shows that b d e for all d thus we have h 2 s d b d e we now recall a notion from classical banach space theory about regarding a vector as an operator acting on the scalars this notion is important as motivation 3 strong l 2 functions 19 for the study of strong l 2 functions let e be a separable complex hilbert space for a function f t e define f t b c e by 3 6 f z f z c if g t e is a countable valued function of the form g k 1 xk k xk e then for each c k 1 xk k k 1 xk k g g which implies that g is a countable valued function of the form g k 1 xk k we then have lemma 3 6 let e be a separable complex hilbert space and 1 p define l p e l p b c e by f z f z where f z c e is given by f z f z then a is unitary and hence l p e lpb c e b l p b c e l p s b c e for 1 p c f n f n for f lpe and n z in particular h p e hpb c e h p s b c e for 1 p proof a let f lp e 1 p be arbitrary we first show that f l p b c e since f is strongly measurable there exist countable valued functions fn such that f z limn fn z for almost all z t observe that for almost all z t f z b c e sup 1 f z e f z e thus we have that fn z f z b c e fn z f z e 0 as n which implies that f is strongly measurable and f lp b c e f lp e thus is an isometry for h lpb c e let g z h z 1 l p e then for all c we have g z h z 1 h z which implies that is a surjection from l p e onto l p b c e thus is unitary so that l p e lpb c e this proves a b suppose h lps b c e 1 p if g z h z 1 l p e then h g lpb c e the converse is clear c let f lpe then for all c and n z f n t zn f z dm t znf z dm f n f n which gives c the last assertion follows at once from b and c 20 3 strong l 2 functions for x a closed subspace of d px denotes the orthogonal projection from d onto x then we have lemma 3 7 if dimd then a l 2 s t b d e l 2 b d e b h 2 s t b d e h 2 b d e where the equalities are set theoretic proof a let d dimd it follows from 3 1 that l 2 b d e l 2 s b d e for the reverse inclusion let ej dj 1 be an orthonormal basis of d suppose l 2 s b d e then j z z ej l 2 e j 1 2 d it thus follows from lemma 3 6 that j l 2 b c e for j 1 2 d define j t b d e by j j pdj c dj ej since j is strongly measurable it is easy to show that j is strongly measurable for each j 1 2 it follows from lemma 3 6 that j 2 l 2 b d e t j z 2 b d e dm z t j z 2 b c e dm z j 2 l 2 b c e j 2 l 2 e thus j l 2 b d e and hence d j 1 j l 2 b d e this proves a b this follows from lemma 2 2 and a to proceed we define a boundary function b for each function h 2 s d b d e with dim d in this case we may assume that d cd let h 2 s d b d e and ej dj 1 be the canonical basis for cd then j ej h 2 d e thus we have 3 7 j z b j z lim rz z j rz h 2 e it follows from lemma 3 6 that for each j 1 2 3 d j h 2 b c e h 2 s t b c e where j z j z for all c note that there exists a subset t with m 0 such that 3 8 j z e for each z t 0 t define a function b on h 2 s d b d e by 3 9 b z 1 z 2 z d z z t 0 3 strong l 2 functions 21 then we have that for all x d 3 10 b z x lim rz z rz x e z t 0 a straightforward calculation shows that b z is a linear mapping from d into e for almost all z t we thus have theorem 3 8 if dimd then the function b defined by 3 9 is a linear bijection from h 2 s d b d e onto h 2 s t b d e proof let d dimd then we may assume that d cd let ej dj 1 be the canonical basis for cd and t 0 be defined as the above 1 b is well defined let h 2 s d b cd e then it follows from 3 8 that for each z 0 t 0 b z 0 b cd e d n 1 j z 0 e which implies that b z 0 is bounded for each z 0 t 0 if x x 1 x 2 xd t cd then b z x d n 1 xj j z h 2 e which implies that b h 2 s b cd e and hence b is well defined 2 b is linear immediate from a direct calculation 3 b is one one let h 2 s d b cd e if b b then it follows that for each x cd and rz d rz x b x pr z 2 0 pr t b eit xdm t 2 0 pr t b eit xdm t rz x z ei which gives the result 4 b is onto let a h 2 s t b cd e then a z ej h 2 e for all j 1 2 d for each j 1 2 d let j rz aej pr z h 2 d e and define 1 2 d rz 22 3 strong l 2 functions then h 2 s d b cd e it follows from 3 10 that for all x x 1 x 2 xd t cd and for almost all z t b z x lim rz z rz x lim rz z d j 1 xj j rz d j 1 xja z ej a z x which implies that b is onto this completes the proof we thus have corollary 3 9 if dimd then the function b defined by 3 9 is an isometric bijection from h 2 d b d e onto h 2 b d e proof by theorem 3 8 together with theorem 3 3 and lemma 3 7 the func tion b defined by 3 9 is a linear bijection from h 2 d b d e onto h 2 b d e in view of the banach space valued version of the usual hardy space theory cf ni 2 theorem 3 11 6 it suffices to show that 3 11 reit b pr eit indeed if z t r 0 1 and x d then b pr eit x 2 0 pr t b eit dm t x 2 0 pr t b eit xdm t by lemma 2 2 reit x which gives 3 11 according to the convention of the usual hardy space theory we will identify b with h 2 d b d e in this sense we eventually have corollary 3 10 if dim d then h 2 s d b d e h 2 d b d e h 2 b d e h 2 s t b d e where the first and last equalities are set theoretic while the second equality es tablishes an isometric isomorphism proof this follows from theorem 3 3 lemma 3 7 and corollary 3 9 a function h b d e is called an inner function with values in b d e if z is an isometric operator from d into e for almost all z t i e id a e on t is called a two sided inner function if ie a e on t and id a e on t if is an inner function with values in b d e we may 3 strong l 2 functions 23 assume that d is a subspace of e and if further is two sided inner then we may assume that d e we write pd for the set of all polynomials with values in d i e p z n k 0 p k z k where p k d if f is a strong h 2 function with values in b d e then the function fp belongs to h 2 e for all p pd the strong h 2 function f is called outer if clfpd h 2 e we then have an analogue of the scalar factorization theorem inner outer factorization for strong h 2 functions cf ni 1 corollary i 9 every strong h 2 function f with values in b d e can be expressed in the form f f if e where f e is an outer function with values in b d e and f i is an inner function with values in b e e for some subspace e of e for a function t b d e write z z we call the flip of for l 2 s b d e we denote by p and p the functions p x p x a e on t x d p x p x a e on t x d where p and p are the orthogonal projections from l 2 e onto h 2 e and l 2 e h 2 e respectively then we may write note that if l 2 s b d e then h 2 s b d e in the sequel we will often encounter the adjoints of inner matrix functions if is a two sided inner matrix function it is easy to show that is of bounded type i e all entries of are of bounded type see p 3 we may predict that if is an inner matrix function then is of bounded type however the following example shows that this is not the case example 3 11 let h z e 1 z 3 then h h and h is not of bounded type let f z h z 2 h clearly f is not of bounded type let h 1 z 1 f z 2 then h 1 l and h 1 1 2 thus there exists an outer function g such that h 1 g a e on t see do 1 corollary 6 25 put f g f g h then f 2 g 2 f 2 h 1 2 1 a e on t which implies that is an inner function note that is not necessarily of bounded type for a function h 2 s b d e we say that an inner function with values in b d e is a left inner divisor of if a for a h 2 s b d d for h 2 s b d 1 e and h 2 s b d 2 e we say that and are left coprime if the only common left inner divisor of both and is a unitary operator also we say that and are right coprime if and are left coprime left or right 24 3 strong l 2 functions coprime ness seems to be somewhat delicate problem left or right coprime ness for matrix valued functions was developed in chkl chl 1 chl 2 chl 3 and ff lemma 3 12 if is a two sided inner function then any left inner divisor of is two sided inner proof suppose that is a two sided inner function with values in b e and is a left inner divisor with values in b e e of then we may write a for some a h 2 s b e e since is two sided inner it follows that ie aa a e on t so that ie aa a e on t thus ie a e on t and hence is two sided inner lemma 3 13 if l b d e then l b e d in this case 3 12 n n n n z in particular h b d e if and only if h b e d proof suppose l b d e then ess supz t z ess supz t z which together with lemma 2 1 implies l b e d the first equality of the assertion 3 12 comes from the definition for the second equality observe that for each x d y e and n z n x y t zn z xdm z y t zn z x y dm z by 2 3 t x zn z y dm z x n y lemma 3 14 let 1 p if l b d e then lps b e d lps b e e also if h b d e then h 2 s b e d h 2 s b e e proof suppose that l b d e and a lps b e d let x e be arbitrary then we have a z x lpd let dk k 1 be an orthonormal basis for d thus we may write 3 13 a z x k 1 a z x dk dk for almost all z t thus it follows that for all y e z a z x y k 1 a z x dk z dk y 3 strong l 2 functions 25 which implies that a is wot measurable on the other hand since l b d e it follows that t a z x pedm z p t a z x pddm z x e which implies that a lps b e e this proves the first assertion for the second assertion suppose h b d e and a h 2 s b e d then a l 2 s b e e assume to the contrary that a h 2 s b e e thus there exists n 0 0 such that a n 0 6 0 thus for some x 0 e 3 14 t zn 0 z a z x 0 dm z 6 0 then by 2 3 there exists a nonzero y 0 e such that 3 15 0 6 t zn 0 z a z x 0 dm z y 0 t a z x 0 z n 0 z y 0 dm z on the other hand since h b d e it follows from lemma 3 13 that n 0 n 0 0 thus it follows from 2 3 that 0 n 0 y 0 a z x 0 t zn 0 z y 0 a z x 0 dm z a contradiction corollary 3 15 let 1 p if l b d e then lpd l p e also if h b d e then h 2 d h 2 e proof suppose that l b d e for f lpd we can see that f f the result thus follows from lemma 3 6 and lemma 3 14 for an inner function h b e e h denotes the orthogonal com plement of the subspace h 2 e in h 2 e i e h h 2 e h 2 e the space h is often called a model space or a de branges rovnyak space cf dr sa sfbk we then have corollary 3 16 let be an inner function with values in b d e then f h if and only if f h 2 e and f l 2 d h 2 d proof let f h 2 e by lemma 3 13 and corollary 3 15 f l 2 d then f h if and only if f g 0 for all g h 2 d if and only if f g 0 for all g h 2 d which gives the result chapter 4 the beurling lax halmos theorem in this chapter we introduce the beurling lax halmos theorem and the douglas shapiro shields factorization then we coin the new notions of complementary factor of an inner function degree of non cyclicity strong l 2 functions of bounded type and meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type for operator valued functions 4 1 the beurling lax halmos theorem we first review a few essential facts for vectorial toeplitz operators and vectorial hankel operators and for that we will use bs do 1 do 2 mr ni 1 ni 2 and pe for general references for l 2 s b d e the hankel operator h h 2 d h 2 e is a densely defined operator defined by h p jp p p pd where j denotes the unitary operator from l 2 e to l 2 e given by jg z zg z for g l 2 e also a toeplitz operator t h 2 d h 2 e is a densely defined operator defined by t p p p p pd the following lemma gives a characterization of bounded hankel operators on h 2 d lemma 4 1 pe theorem 2 2 let l 2 s b d e thenh is extended to a bounded operator on h 2 d if and only if there exists a function l b d e such that n n for n 0 and h distl h b d e the following basic properties can be easily derived if d e and d are separable complex hilbert spaces and l b d e then t t h h 4 1 h t h if h b d d 4 2 h t h if h b e d 4 3 a shift operator se on h 2 e is defined by sef z zf z for each f h 2 e thus we may write se tzie 27 28 4 the beurling lax halmos theorem the following theorem is a fundamental result in modern operator theory the beurling lax halmos theorem beu lax ha 1 ff pe a sub space m of h 2 e is invariant for the shift operator se on h 2 e if and only if m h 2 e where e is a subspace of e and is an inner function with values in b e e furthermore is unique up to a unitary constant right factor i e if m h 2 e where is an inner function with values in b e e then v where v is a unitary operator from e onto e as customarily done we say that two inner functions a b h b d e are equal if they are equal up to a unitary constant right factor if l b d e then by 4 2 and 4 3 h se s eh which implies that the kernel of the hankel operator h is an invariant subspace of the shift operator se on h 2 e thus by the beurling lax halmos theorem kerh h 2 e for some inner function with values in b e e we note that e may be the zero space and need not be two sided inner we however have lemma 4 2 if l b d e and is a two sided inner function with values in b e then the following are equivalent a kerh h 2 e b a where a h b e d is such that and a are right coprime proof let l b d e and be a two sided inner function with values in b e a b suppose kerh h 2 e if we put a h b e d then a we now claim that and a are right coprime to see this suppose is a common left inner divisor with values in b e e of and a then we may write 1 and a a 1 where 1 h b e e and a 1 h b d e since is two sided inner it follows from lemma 3 12 and lemma 3 13 that and 1 are two sided inner since 1 a 1 we have 1 h 2 e kerh h 2 e 1 h 2 e which implies h 2 e h 2 e thus by the beurling lax halmos theorem is a unitary constant and so is therefore and a are right coprime b a suppose b holds clearly h 2 e kerh by the beurling lax halmos theorem kerh h 2 e for some inner function so that h 2 e h 2 e thus is a left inner divisor of cf ff pe so that by lemma 3 12 we may write 0 for some two sided inner function 0 with values in b e e put g h b e d then g a 0 and hence a 0 g but since and a are right coprime 0 is a unitary operator and so is 0 therefore kerh h 2 e which proves a 4 the beurling lax halmos theorem 29 we recall that the factorization in lemma 4 2 b is called the canonical douglas shapiro shields factorization of l b d e see dss fb fu 2 consequently lemma 4 2 may be rephrased as if l b d e then the fol lowing are equivalent a admits a douglas shapiro shields factorization b kerh h 2 e for some two sided inner function h b e the following lemma will be frequently used in the sequel complementing lemma ni 1 p 49 p 53 let h b e e with e e and dim e and let be a scalar inner function then the following statements are equivalent a there exists a function g in h b e e such that g ie b there exist functions and in h b e with e e e being an inner function such that ie in addition if dim e then a and b are equivalent to the following state ment c ess infz tmin z x x 1 0 we recall that if is a strongh 2 function with values in b d e with dime the local rank of is defined by cf ni 1 rank max d rank where rank dim d as we have remarked in the introduction if is a strong l 2 function with values in b d e then h need not be a hankel operator of course if l b d e then by 4 1 h h h by contrast for a strong l 2 function with values in b d e h 6 h in general even though is also a strong l 2 function we note that if is a strong l 2 function with values in b e d then kerh is possibly trivial because h is defined in the dense subset of polynomials in h 2 e thus it is much better to deal with h in place of h even though h need not be a hankel operator we can show that the kernel of h is still of the form h 2 d for some inner function to see this we observe lemma 4 3 let be a strong l 2 function with values in b d e then kerh f h 2 e t z x znf z e dm z 0 for all x d and n 1 2 3 proof observe that f kerh h p f l 2 e 0 for all p pd z p z jf z l 2 e 0 for all p pd t z xzk zf z e dm z 0 for all x d and k 0 1 2 t z x znf z e dm z 0 for all x d and n 1 2 3 30 4 the beurling lax halmos theorem which gives the result we then have lemma 4 4 if is a strong l 2 function with values in b d e then 4 4 kerh h 2 e where e is a subspace of e and is an inner function with values in b e e proof by lemma 4 3 if f kerh then zf kerh since kerh is always closed it follows that kerh is an invariant subspace for se thus by the beurling lax halmos theorem there exists an inner function with values in b e e such that kerh h 2 e for a subspace e of e 4 2 complementary factors of inner functions let i h b ei e i j be a family of inner functions then the greatest common left inner divisor d and the least common left inner multiple m of the family i i j are the inner functions defined by dh 2 d i j ih 2 ei and mh 2 d i j ih 2 ei by the beurling lax halmos theorem d and m exist and are unique up to a unitary constant right factor we write d left g c d i i j and m left l c m i i j if i is a scalar inner function we write g c d i i j left g c d i i j and l c m i i j left l c m i i j for l b d e we symbolically define the kernel of by ker f h 2 d z f z 0 for almost all z t note that the kernel of consists of functions in h 2 d but not in l 2 d such that f 0 a e on t since ker is an invariant subspace for sd it follows from the beurling lax halmos theorem that ker h 2 d for some inner function h d d let be an inner function with values in b d e if g ker then g h 2 e so that by lemma 3 5 and lemma 3 6 g is a strong h 2 function with values in b c e see p 19 for the definition of g write g g i g e inner outer factorization where g e is an outer function with values in b c e and g i is an inner function with values in b e e for some subspace e of e if g 6 0 then g e is a nonzero outer function so that e c thus g i h b c e if instead g 0 then e 0 therefore in this case g i h b 0 e we then have 4 the beurling lax halmos theorem 31 lemma 4 5 let be an inner function with values in b d e then we may write 4 5 ker h 2 d for some inner function with values in b d e put 4 6 c left g c d g i g ker then we have a c b c is an inner function with values in b d d e c kerh c h 2 d d h 2 d ch 2 d where c is obtained by complementing c to in other words c is regarded as a 1 2 operator matrix definition 4 6 the inner function c in 4 6 is said to be the complementary factor of the inner function proof of lemma 4 5 if ker 0 then a and b are trivial suppose that ker 6 0 recall that 4 7 c left g c d g i g ker h b d e where d is a nonzero subspace of e if g ker then it follows from 4 5 that ch 2 d g ih 2 g ker g pc g ker ker h 2 d for the reverse inclusion let 0 6 g ker then it follows that g z g z 1 g i g e z 1 g i z g e z 1 g ih 2 thus we have h 2 d ker g ih 2 g ker ch 2 d therefore by the beurling lax halmos theorem c and d d which gives a note that c 0 we thus have c c id 0 0 id which implies that c is an inner function with values in b d d e which gives b for c we first note that h 2 d and ker are orthogonal and h 2 d ker kerh for the reverse inclusion suppose that f h 2 e and f h 2 d ker m write f 1 pmf and f 2 f f 1 6 0 32 4 the beurling lax halmos theorem since f 2 h 2 e m h h 2 e ker it follows from corollary 3 16 that f 2 l 2 d h 2 d and f 2 6 0 we thus have h f j f 2 and hence h f f 2 6 0 which implies that f kerh we thus have that kerh h 2 d ker thus it follows from a that kerh h 2 d ch 2 d c h 2 d d which gives c this completes the proof 4 3 the degree of non cyclicity for a subset f of h 2 e let e f denote the smallest s e invariant subspace containing f i e e f s ne f n 0 then by the beurling lax halmos theorem e f h for an inner function with values in b d e in general if dime 1 then every s e invariant subspace m admits a cyclic vector i e m e f for some f h 2 however if dime 2 then this is not such a case for example if m h with z 00 z then m does not admit a cyclic vector i e m 6 e f for any vector f h 2 c 2 if h 2 s b d e and dk k 1 is an orthonormal basis for d write k dk h 2 e h 2 s b c e we then define k k 1 h 2 e hence may be regarded as the set of column vectors k in h 2 e of in which case we may think of as an infinite matrix valued function lemma 4 7 for h 2 s b d e we have 4 8 e cl ranhz remark 4 8 by definition depends on the orthonormal basis ofd how ever lemma 4 7 shows that e is independent of a particular choice of the or thonormal basis of d because the right hand side of 4 8 is independent of the orthonormal basis of d proof of lemma 4 7 we first claim that if f h 2 e then 4 9 e f cl ranh zf 4 the beurling lax halmos theorem 33 to see this observe that for each k 1 2 s ke f z j 0 f k j zj 1 j j 0 f k j zj 1 jp zk 1 j 0 f j zj jp zk 1 f h zf zk which proves 4 9 let dk k 1 be an orthonormal basis for d and let k dk since by 4 9 e k cl ranh z k for each k 1 2 3 it follows that e ranh z k cl ranh z which gives the result we now introduce definition 4 9 let f h 2 e the degree of non cyclicity denoted by nc f of f is defined by the number nc f sup d dim g g h 2 e e f we will often refer to nc f as the nc number of f since e f is an invariant subspace for s e it follows from the beurling lax halmos theorem that e f h for some inner function with values in b d e thus nc f sup d dim g g h 2 d dimd in particular nc f dime we note that nc f may take so it is customary to make the following conventions i if n is real then n ii if dime r then nc f r for every subset f h 2 e if f h 2 e and dime r then the degree of cyclicity denoted by dc f of f h 2 e is defined by the number cf vn dc f r nc f in particular if e f h then is two sided inner if and only if nc f r the following theorem gives an answer to question 1 3 34 4 the beurling lax halmos theorem theorem 4 10 let be a strong l 2 function with values in b d e in view of the beurling lax halmos theorem and lemma 4 4 we may write e h and kerh h 2 e for some inner functions and with values in b e e and b e e respec tively then 4 10 1 for some two sided inner function 1 with values in b e e hence in particular 4 11 kerh h 2 e nc dime proof suppose that kerh h 2 e for some inner function with values in b e e and e h for some inner function with values in b e e then it follows from lemma 4 7 that h e cl ranhz kerh z it thus follows from lemma 4 3 that h 2 e kerh z f h 2 e t z x znf z e dm z 0 for all x d and n 0 1 2 3 f h 2 e t z x znf z e dm z 0 for all x d and n 1 2 3 kerh h 2 e which implies that is a left inner divisor of thus we can write 4 12 1 for some inner function 1 h b e e by the same argument as above we also have z h 2 e h 2 e so that we may write z 2 for some inner function 2 h b e e therefore by 4 12 we have zie 1 2 and hence by lemma 3 12 1 is two sided inner this proves 4 10 and in turn 4 11 this completes the proof from theorem 4 10 we get several corollaries corollary 4 11 let be a strong l 2 function with value in b d e then the following statements are equivalent a e h 2 e b nc 0 c kerh 0 proof immediate from theorem 4 10 4 the beurling lax halmos theorem 35 corollary 4 12 let be an inner function with values in b d e if c is the complementary factor of with values in b d e then nc dimd dimd proof immediate from lemma 4 5 c and theorem 4 10 corollary 4 13 if is an n m matrix l 2 function i e l 2 mn m then the following are equivalent a is of bounded type b kerh h 2 cn for some two sided inner matrix function c nc n proof the equivalence a c follows from ni 1 corollary 2 p 47 and 2 1 and the equivalence b c follows at once from theorem 4 10 the equivalence a b of corollary 4 13 was known from ghr for the cases of l mn on the other hand it was known ab lemma 4 that if l then 4 13 is of bounded type kerh 6 0 the following corollary shows that 4 13 still holds for l 2 functions corollary 4 14 if l 2 then is of bounded type if and only if kerh 6 0 proof immediate from corollary 4 13 corollary 4 15 if is an n r inner matrix function then the following are equivalent a is of bounded type b is of bounded type c c is two sided inner where c is the complementary factor of proof the equivalence a b is trivial the equivalence b c follows from lemma 4 5 and corollary 4 13 the following corollary gives an answer to question 1 4 corollary 4 16 if is an n r inner matrix function then is inner for some n q q 1 inner matrix function if and only if q nc r in particular is complemented to a two sided inner function if and only if nc n 36 4 the beurling lax halmos theorem proof suppose that is an inner matrix function for some n q q 1 inner matrix function then ir q ir iq which implies that h 2 cq ker since by lemma 4 5 ker ch 2 cp it follows that h 2 cq ch 2 cp so that c is a left inner divisor of thus we can write c 1 for some p q inner matrix function 1 thus we have q p but since by corollary 4 12 nc r p it follows that q nc r for the converse suppose that q nc r then it follows from corollary 4 12 that the complementary factor c of is in h mn p for some p q thus if we take c cq then is inner we give an illuminating example of how to find the nc number example 4 17 let f and g be given in example 3 11 and let f f 0 g g 0 0 0 a a h to find the degree of non cyclicity of write f f g g then it follows that h 1 h 2 h 3 kerh h 1 h 2 kerh and h 3 kerha case 1 if a is not of bounded type then kerh f g 0 th 2 by theorem 4 10 nc 1 case 2 if a is of bounded type of the form a b coprime then kerh f 0 g 0 0 h 2 c 2 by theorem 4 10 nc 2 4 4 strong l 2 functions of bounded type we introduce the notion of bounded type for strong l 2 functions recall that a matrix valued function of bounded type was defined by a matrix whose entries are of bounded type see p 3 but this definition is not appropriate for operator valued functions in particular strong l 2 functions even though the terminology of entry can be properly interpreted thus we need a new idea about how to define a bounded type strong l 2 functions which is equivalent to the condition that each entry is of bounded type when the function is matrix valued our motivation stems from the equivalence a b in corollary 4 13 4 the beurling lax halmos theorem 37 definition 4 18 a strong l 2 function with values in b d e is said to be of bounded type if kerh h 2 e for some two sided inner function with values in b e on the other hand in fb it was shown that if belongs to l b d e then admits a douglas shapiro shields factorization see p 29 if and only if e h for a two sided inner function thus by theorem 4 10 we can see that if l b d e then 4 14 is of bounded type admits a douglas shapiro shields factorization we can prove more lemma 4 19 let be a strong l 2 function with values in b d e then the following are equivalent a is of bounded type b e h for some two sided inner function with values in b e c e h for some two sided inner function with values in b e d h for some two sided inner function with values in b e e for k 1 k 2 write k 1 k 2 then is of bounded type proof a b suppose that is of bounded type then kerh h 2 e for some two sided inner function with values in b e it thus follows from theorem 4 10 that e h for some two sided inner function with values in b e b c c d clear d e suppose that k 1 k 2 and h for some two sided inner function h b e write k 1 k 2 then h so that e h suppose that e h for some inner function with values in b d e thus h 2 e h 2 d so that by lemma 3 12 is two sided inner thus by theorem 4 10 kerh h 2 e for some two sided inner function with values in b e so that is of bounded type e a clear corollary 4 20 let be an inner function with values in b d e then is of bounded type c is two sided inner where c is the complementary factor of hence in particular if is a two sided inner function with values in b e then is of bounded type proof the first assertion follows from lemma 4 5 the second assertion follows from the first assertion together with the observation that if is two sided inner then c corollary 4 21 let be an inner function with values in b d e then is two sided inner for some inner function with values in b d e if and only if is of bounded type 38 4 the beurling lax halmos theorem proof suppose that is two sided inner for some inner function with values in b d e then 0 so that h 2 d ker ch 2 d thus c is a left inner divisor of and hence c is a left inner divisor of therefore by lemma 3 12 c is two sided inner so that by corollary 4 20 is of bounded type the converse follows at once from corollary 4 20 with c we now ask if 1 2 m h mn m is an inner matrix function does there exist j 1 j m such that dc j dc the answer however is negative to see this let f and g be given in example 3 11 and let f 0 g 0 0 f 0 g 1 2 since f 0 0 g 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 is inner in view of corollary 4 16 we have dc 1 1 but since dc 1 6 0 because 1 is not of bounded type it follows that dc 1 1 similarly dc 2 1 however we have dc 2 because we can show that c 0 4 5 meromorphic pseudo continuations of bounded type in general if a strong l 2 function is of bounded type then we cannot guarantee that each entry ij dj ei is of bounded type where dj and ei are orthonormal bases of d and e respectively but if we strengthen the assumption then we may have the assertion to see this for a function de z 1 z b d e we define d d b e d by d 1 for d if d is a strong h 2 function inner and two sided inner with values in b e d then we shall say that is a strong h 2 function inner and two sided inner in de with values in b d e respectively a b d e valued function is said to be meromorphic of bounded type in de if it can be represented by g where g is a strong h 2 function in de with values in b d e and is a scalar inner function in de cf fu 2 a function l 2 s b d e is said to have a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de if is meromorphic of bounded type in de and is the nontangential sot limit of that is for all x d z x z x lim rz z rz x for almost all z t 4 the beurling lax halmos theorem 39 note that for almost all z t z x lim rz z rz x lim rz z d r 1 z x d z x x d we then have lemma 4 22 let be a strong l 2 function with values in b d e if has a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de then is of bounded type proof suppose that has a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de thus the meromorphic pseudo continuation of can be written as g de where g is a strong h 2 function in de with values in b d e and is a scalar inner function in de then for all x d z x d z x d z g d z x for almost all z t thus for all x d p pe and n 1 2 3 t z x zn d z p z e dm z t g d z x z np z e dm z x zngd z p z l 2 d 0 where the last equality follows from the fact that zngd z p z zh 2 d thus by lemma 4 3 we can see that 4 15 dh 2 e cl dpe kerh in view of lemma 4 4 kerh h 2 e for some inner function with values in b e e thus is a left inner divisor of die cf ff pe thus it follows from lemma 3 12 that that is two sided inner so that is of bounded type the following lemma was proved in fu 1 under the more restrictive setting of h b d e lemma 4 23 let l b d e then the following are equivalent a has a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de b h 2 e kerh for some scalar inner function c a for a scalar inner function and some a h b e d proof first of all recall that l b d e l 2 s b d e a b this follows from 4 15 in the proof of lemma 4 22 b c suppose that h 2 e kerh for some scalar inner function put a then a belongs to h b e d and a c a suppose that a for a scalar inner function and some a h b e d thus it follows from lemma 3 5 that a is a strong h 2 function let a 1 1 de 40 4 the beurling lax halmos theorem then is meromorphic of bounded type in de and for all x d z x a z x z z a z x z x for almost all z t which implies that has a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de an examination of the proof of lemma 4 23 shows that lemma 4 23 still holds for every function l 2 b d e corollary 4 24 if l 2 b d e then lemma 4 23 holds with a h 2 b e d in place of a h b e d the following proposition gives an answer to an opening remark of this section proposition 4 25 let d and e be separable complex hilbert spaces and let dj and ei be orthonormal bases of d and e respectively if l 2 b d e has a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de then ij z z dj ei e is of bounded type for each i j proof let l 2 b d e suppose that has a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de then by corollary 4 24 a for a scalar inner function and some a h 2 b e d write ij z z dj ei e and aij z a z dj ei e then for each i j t ij z 2 dm z t z dj ei e 2 dm z t z 2 b d e dm z which implies ij l 2 similarly aij l 2 and for n 1 2 3 a ij n t zn a z dj ei edm z dj z na z ei l 2 d 0 which implies aij h 2 note that ij z z a z dj ei e z aij z which implies that ij is of bounded type for each i j example 4 26 the converse of lemma 4 22 is not true in general to see this let n be a sequence of distinct points in d such that n 1 1 n and put diag b n where b n z z n 1 nz then is two sided inner and hence by lemma 4 20 is of bounded type on the other hand by lemma 4 5 kerh h 2 2 thus if had a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de then by lemma 4 23 we would have h 2 2 h 2 2 for a scalar inner function so that we should have n 0 for each n 1 2 and hence 0 a contradiction therefore cannot have a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de 4 the beurling lax halmos theorem 41 for matrix valued cases a function having a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de is actually a function whose flip is of bounded type corollary 4 27 for ij l 2 mn m the following are equivalent a has a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de b is of bounded type c ij is of bounded type for each i j proof a b this follows from lemma 4 22 b a suppose that is of bounded type then kerh h 2 cn for some two sided inner function h mn thus by the complementing lemma cf p 29 there exist a scalar inner function and a function g in h mn such that g g in and hence h 2 cn gh 2 cn h 2 cn kerh it thus follows from corollary 4 24 that has a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de a c this follows from corollary 4 24 and proposition 4 25 however by contrast to the matrix valued case it may happened that an l function is not of bounded type in the sense of definition 4 18 even though each entry ij of is of bounded type example 4 28 let j be a sequence of distinct points in 0 1 satisfying j 1 1 j for each j z choose a sequence ij of distinct points on the circle cj z c z j let bij b ij i j i j z where b z z 1 z and let bij b 11 2 b 12 3 b 13 4 b 21 3 b 22 4 b 23 5 b 31 4 b 32 5 b 33 6 observe that i j bij z 2 i i 1 i 2 i 1 1 i 2 which implies that l b 2 for a function f h 2 2 we write f f 1 f 2 f 3 t fn h 2 thus if f f 1 f 2 f 3 t kerh then j b ij i j fj h 2 for each i z which forces that fj ij 0 for each i j thus fj 0 for each j by the identity theorem therefore we can conclude that kerh 0 so that is not of bounded type but we note that every entry of is of bounded type we conclude this chapter with an application to c 0 contractions the class c 0 denotes the set of all contractions t b h satisfying the con dition 1 4 the class c 00 denotes the set of all contractions t b h such 42 4 the beurling lax halmos theorem that limn t nx 0 and limn t nx 0 for each x h it was known ni 1 p 43 that if t is a c 0 contraction with characteristic function i e t s e h then 4 16 t c 00 is two sided inner a contraction t b h is called a completely non unitary c n u if there exists no nontrivial reducing subspace on which t is unitary the class c 0 is the set of all c n u contractions t such that there exists a nonzero function h annihilating t i e t 0 where t is given by the calculus of sz nagy and foias we can easily check that c 0 c 00 moreover it is well known ni 1 p 73 that if t ph se h c 00 and h then 4 17 t 0 g h b e such that g g ie the theory of spectral multiplicity for operators of class c 0 has been well developed see ni 1 appendix 1 sfbk if t c 0 then there exists an inner function mt such that mt t 0 and h t 0 mt h the function mt is called the minimal annihilator of the operator t in view of 4 16 we may ask what is a condition on the characteristic function of t for a c 0 contraction t to belong to the class c 0 the following proposition gives an answer proposition 4 29 let t s e h for an inner function with values in b d e then the following are equivalent a t c 0 b is two sided inner and has a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de hence in particular if is an inner matrix function then t c 0 if and only if t c 00 proof a b suppose t c 0 and hence t 0 for some nonzero function h then t c 00 so that by the above remark is two sided inner thus by the model theorem we have t ph se h it thus follows from 4 17 that there exists h b e such that ie thus h h 2 e h h 2 e 0 we thus have ih 2 e cl h 2 e kerh it thus follows from lemma 4 23 that has a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de this gives the implication a b b a suppose that is two sided inner and has a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de then by lemma 4 5 and lemma 4 23 there exists a scalar function such that h 2 e kerh h 2 e thus we may write ie for some h b e thus we have ph se h ph ie h 0 4 the beurling lax halmos theorem 43 so that t t ph se h 0 which gives t c 0 this prove the implication b a the second assertion follows from the first together with corollary 4 20 and corollary 4 27 chapter 5 a canonical decomposition of strong l 2 functions in this chapter we establish a canonical decomposition of strong l 2 functions to better understand this canonical decomposition we first consider an example of a matrix valued l 2 function that does not admit a douglas shapiro shields factor ization suppose that 1 and 2 are coprime inner functions consider 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 a 1 2 3 h m 3 where a h is such that a is not of bounded type then a direct calculation shows that kerh 1 0 0 2 0 0 h 2 c 2 h 2 c 2 since is not two sided inner it follows from lemma 4 2 that does not admit a douglas shapiro shields factorization for a decomposition of suppose that 5 1 a where a h 2 m 3 k k 1 2 is an inner function and and a are right coprime we then have 5 2 a h 2 m 3 k but since a is not of bounded type it follows from 5 2 that the 3 rd row vector of is zero thus by 5 1 we must have a 0 a contradiction therefore we could not get any decomposition of the form a with a 3 k inner matrix function for each k 1 2 3 to get another idea we note that ker 0 0 1 th 2 ch 2 then by a direct manipulation we can get 5 3 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 a 1 0 0 2 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 a a cc where and a are right coprime because h 2 c 3 a h 2 c 3 h 2 c 2 to encounter another situation consider f f 0 g g 0 0 0 a 1 2 3 h m 3 45 46 5 a canonical decomposition of strong l 2 functions where f and g are given in example 3 11 is inner and a h is such that and a are coprime it then follows from lemma 4 5 that kerh f g f g h 2 we thus have that kerh kerh f g kerh a f 0 g 0 0 h 2 c 2 h 2 c 2 thus by lemma 4 2 does not admit a douglas shapiro shields factorization observe that 5 4 f f 0 g g 0 0 0 a f 0 g 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 a a since and a are coprime it follows that and a are right coprime note that is not two sided inner and ker 0 the above examples 5 3 and 5 4 seem to signal that the decomposition of a matrix valued h 2 functions satisfying kerh h 2 cn may be affected by the kernel of and in turn the complementary factor c of indeed if we regard as an operator acting from l 2 e and hence ker l 2 e then b in the canonical decomposition 5 5 satisfies the inclusion b ker the following theorem gives a canonical decomposition of strong l 2 functions which realizes the idea inside those examples we are ready for theorem 5 1 a canonical decomposition of strong l 2 functions if is a strong l 2 function with values in b d e then can be expressed in the form 5 5 a b where i is an inner function with values in b e e a h 2 s b d e and b l 2 s b d e ii and a are right coprime iii b 0 iv nc dime in particular if dime for instamce dime then the expression 5 5 is unique up to a unitary constant right factor proof if kerh 0 take e 0 and b then and a are zero operator with codomain 0 thus a b where and a are right coprime it also follows from theorem 4 10 that nc 0 which gives the inequality iv if instead kerh 6 0 then in view of lemma 4 4 we may suppose kerh h 2 e for some nonzero inner function with values in b e e put a then it follows from lemma 3 14 that a is a strong l 2 function 5 a canonical decomposition of strong l 2 functions 47 with values in b d e thus a a is a strong l 2 function with values in b d e since kerh h 2 e it follows that for all p pd and h h 2 e 0 h p h l 2 e t z p z z z h z e dm z t z z p z zh z e dm z h a p h l 2 e which implies h a 0 thus by lemma 4 1 a belongs to h 2 s b d e put b a then by lemma 3 14 b is a strong l 2 function with values in b d e observe that a b and b 0 for the first assertion we need to show that and a are right coprime to see this we suppose that is a common left inner divisor with values in b e e of and a then we may write 1 and a a 1 where 1 h b e e and a 1 h 2 s b d e thus we have 5 6 1 and a a 1 since is inner it follows that 1 and hence by lemma 3 13 1 is inner we now claim that 5 7 1 h 2 e kerh h 2 e since is an inner function with values in b e e we know that h b e e by lemma 3 13 thus it follows from corollary 3 15 and 5 6 that h 2 e 1 h 2 e 1 h 2 e for the reverse inclusion by 5 6 we may write 1 a 1 b since 0 b 1 b it follows that 1 b 0 therefore for all f h 2 e x d and n 1 2 we have t z x zn 1 z f z e dm z t 1 z a 1 z b z x zn 1 z f z e dm z t a 1 z x z nf z e dm z a 1 z x z nf z l 2 e 0 where the last equality follows from the fact that a 1 z x a 1 z x l 2 e zh 2 e thus by lemma 4 3 we have 1 h 2 e kerh h 2 e which proves 5 7 thus it follows from the beurling lax halmos theorem and 5 6 that is a unitary operator and so is therefore a and are right 48 5 a canonical decomposition of strong l 2 functions coprime the assertion iv on the nc number comes from theorem 4 10 this proves the first assertion 5 5 suppose dime for the uniqueness of the expression 5 5 we suppose that 1 a 1 b 1 2 a 2 b 2 are two canonical decompositions of we want to show that 1 2 which gives a 1 1 1 a 1 b 1 2 2 a 2 b 2 a 2 and in turn b 1 b 2 which implies that the representation 5 5 is unique to prove 1 2 it suffices to show that if a b is a canonical decomposition of then 5 8 kerh h 2 e if e 0 then nc 0 thus it follows from corollary 4 11 that kerh 0 h 2 e which proves 5 8 if instead e 6 0 then we suppose r dime thus we may assume that e cr so that is an inner function with values in b cr e suppose that a b is a canonical decomposition of in l 2 s b d e we first claim that 5 9 h 2 cr kerh observe that for each g h 2 cr x d and k 1 2 3 t z x zk z g z e dm z t a z x zkg z cr dm z a z x zkg z l 2 cr 0 it thus follows from lemma 4 3 that h 2 cr kerh which proves 5 9 in view of lemma 4 4 we may assume that kerh h 2 e for some inner function with values in b e e then by theorem 4 10 5 10 p dime nc r thus we may assume e cp since 5 11 h 2 cr kerh h 2 cp it follows that is left inner divisor of i e there exists a p r inner matrix function 1 such that 1 since 1 is inner it follows that r p but since by 5 10 p r we must have r p which implies that 1 is two sided inner thus we have 5 12 1 a 1 b 1 a since kerh h 2 cr it follows from lemma 4 3 and 5 12 that for all f h 2 cr x d and n 1 2 5 13 t 1 z a z x znf z cr dm z t z x zn z f z e dm z 0 write 1 a then by lemma 3 14 l 2 s b d cr thus by lemma 4 1 lemma 4 3 and 5 13 we have h 2 s b d cr since a 1 it follows that 1 is a common left inner divisor of and a but since and a are right 5 a canonical decomposition of strong l 2 functions 49 coprime it follows that 1 is a unitary matrix and so is 1 which proves 5 8 this proves the uniqueness of the expression 5 5 when dime this completes the proof the proof of theorem 5 1 shows that the inner function in a canonical decomposition 5 5 of a strong l 2 function can be obtained from equation kerh h 2 e which is guaranteed by the beurling lax halmos theorem see corollary 4 4 in this case the expression 5 5 will be called the blh canonical decomposition of in the viewpoint that comes from the beurling lax halmos theorem however if dime even though dimd then it is possible to get another inner function of a canonical decomposition 5 5 for the same function in this case kerh 6 h 2 e indeed the following remark shows that the canonical decompo sition 5 5 is not unique in general remark 5 2 if dime even though dimd the canonical decom position 5 5 may not be unique even if is of bounded type to see this let be an inner function with values in b c 2 2 defined by 1 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 where 1 and 2 are scalar inner functions then kerh kerh diag 1 1 2 1 1 1 h 2 2 h 2 2 which implies that is of bounded type since is two sided inner see definition 4 18 let a 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 and b 0 then a belongs to belongs to h 2 s b c 2 2 and h 2 2 a h 2 c 2 h 2 2 which im plies that and a are right coprime clearly b 0 and nc dim 2 therefore a 50 5 a canonical decomposition of strong l 2 functions is the blh canonical decomposition of on the other hand to get another canonical decomposition of let 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 then is an inner function if we define a 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 and b 0 then a 1 belongs to h 2 s b c 2 2 such that and a 1 are right coprime b 0 and nc dim 2 therefore a 1 is also a canonical decomposition of in this case kerh 6 h 2 2 therefore the canonical decomposition of is not unique remark 5 3 let be an inner matrix function with values in b e e then theorem 5 1 says that if dime the expression 5 5 satisfying the conditions i iv in theorem 5 1 gives kerh h 2 e we note that the condition iv on nc number cannot be dropped from the assumptions of theorem 5 1 to see this let 1 2 z 1 a 2 0 and b 0 if a b z 0 1 0 then satisfies the conditions i ii and iii but kerh zh 2 h 2 6 h 2 note that by theorem 4 10 nc 2 which does not satisfy the condition on nc number say nc 1 corollary 5 4 if is of bounded type then b in 5 5 is given by b c c where c is the complementary factor of with values in b d e moreover if dime then dimd can be computed by the formula dimd nc nc proof suppose that is of bounded type then by corollary 4 20 c is two sided inner where c is the complementary factor of with values in b d e we thus have i c c c c so that b a i c c 5 a canonical decomposition of strong l 2 functions 51 this proves the first assertion the second assertion follows at once from the facts that nc dime by theorem 4 10 and nc dime dimd by corollary 4 12 the following corollary is an extension of lemma 4 2 the douglas shapiro shields factorization to strong l 2 functions corollary 5 5 if is a strong l 2 function with values in b d e then the following are equivalent a the flip of is of bounded type b a is two sided inner is a canonical decomposition of proof the implication a b follows from the proof of theorem 5 1 for the implication b a suppose a is two sided inner is a canonical decomposition of by lemma 4 4 there exists an inner function with values in b d e such that kerh h 2 d then it follows from lemma 4 3 that h 2 e kerh h 2 d since is two sided inner we have that by lemma 3 12 is two sided inner and hence the flip of is of bounded type this completes the proof if is an inner matrix function such that is analytic even though is not of bounded type then the perturbation part b of the canonical decomposition may be also determined in terms of the complementary factor of corollary 5 6 let be an n m matrix valued h 2 function then the following are equivalent a kerh h 2 cr for an n r inner matrix function such that is analytic b a c c is a canonical decomposition of where c is the complementary factor of proof a b suppose that kerh h 2 cr for an n r inner matrix function such that is analytic then by the proof of theorem 5 1 we can write a b where b i write 1 1 m since h 2 mn m and i 0 it follows from corollary 3 15 and lemma 4 5 that for each j 1 2 m i j ker ch 2 cp which implies that b i cd for some d h 2 mp m thus cb c i d so that b cd c c i c c b a suppose that a c c is a canonical decomposition of since is a matrix valued function it follows from theorem 5 1 that c c b i 52 5 a canonical decomposition of strong l 2 functions so that c c but since c c j j 0 for all j 1 2 m it follows that h 2 mn m this completes the proof corollary 5 7 let be an n m matrix valued h 2 function satisfying kerh h 2 cr for an n r inner matrix function such that is analytic then can be written as 5 14 a cc with c p c h 2 mp m where c is the complementary factor of proof we claim that if is analytic then 5 15 i h 2 cn ch 2 cp to see this let f ch 2 cp then f cg for some g h 2 cp observe that i f i cg cg f which implies that f i h 2 cn thus we have ch 2 cp i h 2 cn the converse inclusion follows from the proof of corollary 5 6 this proves 5 15 thus i is the orthogonal projection that maps from h 2 cn onto ch 2 cp therefore by the projection lemma in ni 1 p 43 we have i h 2 cn cp c so that a b a cp c as desired chapter 6 the beurling degree we first consider question 1 5 question 1 5 can be rephrased as if is an inner function with values in b e e does there exist a strong l 2 function with values in b d e satisfying the equation 6 1 kerh h 2 e to closely understand an answer to question 1 5 we examine a question whether there exists an inner function satisfying kerh h 2 e if is an inner function with values in b e e in fact the answer to this question is negative indeed if kerh h 2 e for some inner function h b d e then by lemma 4 5 we have c and hence c 0 conversely if c 0 then by again lemma 4 5 we should have kerh h 2 e consequently kerh h 2 e for some inner function if and only if c 0 thus if 1 0 then there exists no inner function such that kerh h 2 on the other hand we note that the solution is not unique although there exists an inner function satisfying the equation 6 1 for example if diag z 1 1 then the following are such solutions z 0 0 z 0 0 1 0 0 the following theorem gives an affirmative answer to question 1 5 indeed we can always find a strong l 2 function with values in b d e satisfying the equation kerh h 2 e theorem 6 1 let be an inner function with values in b e e then there exists a function in h 2 s b d e with either d e or d c e satisfying kerh h 2 e proof if ker 0 take then it follows from lemma 4 5 that kerh kerh h 2 e if instead ker 6 0 let c be the complementary factor of with values in b e e for some nonzero hilbert space e choose a cyclic vector g h 2 e of s e and define z cg 53 54 6 the beurling degree where z cg z c e is given by z cg z z c z g z then it follows from lemma 3 6 and corollary 3 15 that belongs to h 2 s b d e where d c e for each x x 0 d f h 2 e and n 1 2 3 we have t z x zn z f z e dm z t z c z g z z x 0 z n z f z e dm z t x 0 z nf z e dm z since c 0 0 it thus follows from lemma 4 3 that 6 2 h 2 e kerh for the reverse inclusion suppose h kerh then by lemma 4 3 we have that for each x 0 e and n 1 2 3 t z x 0 z nh z e dm z 0 which implies by lemma 4 3 that h kerh it thus follows from lemma 4 5 that 6 3 kerh kerh h 2 e ch 2 e assume to the contrary that kerh 6 h 2 e then by 6 2 and 6 3 there exists a nonzero function f h 2 e such that cf kerh it thus follows from lemma 4 3 that for each x x 0 d and n 1 2 3 0 t z x zn c z f z e dm z t z c z g z z x 0 z n c z f z e dm z t z g z znf z e dm z since c 0 which implies that f kerh z g since g is a cyclic vector of s e it thus follows from lemma 4 7 that f cl ranh z g e g 0 which is a contradiction this completes the proof if is an n r inner matrix function then we can find a solution h mn m with m r 1 of the equation kerh h 2 cr corollary 6 2 for a given n r inner matrix function there exists at least a solution h mn m with m r 1 of the equation kerh h 2 cr proof if ker 0 then this is obvious let ker 6 0 and c h mn p be the complementary factor of then by lemma 4 5 1 p n r for j 1 2 p put gj e 1 z j 6 the beurling degree 55 where j are distinct points in the interval 2 3 then it is known that cf ni 1 p 55 g g 1 g 2 gp h cp is a cyclic vector of s cp put z cg then by lemma 3 6 we have h mn r 1 the same argument as the proof of theorem 6 1 gives the result corollary 6 3 if is an inner function with values in b e e then there exists a function l 2 s b d e with d e or d c e such that a b is the blh canonical decomposition of proof by theorem 6 1 there exists a function h 2 s b d e such that kerh h 2 e with d e or d c e if we put a and b a then by the proof of the first assertion of theorem 5 1 a b is the blh canonical decomposition of remark 6 4 in view of corollary 6 2 it is reasonable to ask whether such a solution l 2 mn m of the equation kerh h 2 cr an n r inner matrix function exists for eachm 1 2 even though it exists for somem for example let 6 4 1 2 z 1 then by corollary 6 2 there exists a solution l 2 m 2 m m 1 or 2 of the equation kerh h 2 for m 2 let 6 5 z za 1 a h m 2 where a h is such that a is not of bounded type then a direct calculation shows that kerh kerh h 2 we may then ask how about the case m 1 in this case the answer is affirmative to see this let z za 1 a h m 2 1 where a h is such that a is not of bounded type then a direct calculation shows that kerh h 2 therefore if is given by 6 4 then we may assert that there exists a solution l 2 mn m of the equation kerh h 2 for each m 1 2 however this assertion is not true in general i e a solution exists for some m but may not exist for another m 0 m to see this let z 0 0 0 z 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 h m 4 3 then is inner we will show that there exists no solution l 2 m 4 1 i e the case m 1 of the equation kerh h 2 c 3 assume to the contrary that l 2 m 4 1 56 6 the beurling degree is a solution of the equation kerh h 2 c 3 by theorem 5 1 can be written as a b where a h 2 m 1 3 is such that and a are right coprime but since h 2 c 4 zh 2 zh 2 h 2 it follows that h 2 c 4 a h 2 6 h 2 c 3 which implies that and a are not right coprime a contradiction therefore we cannot find any solution in l 2 m 4 1 the case m 1 of the equation ker h h 2 c 3 by contrast if m 2 then we can find a solution l 2 m 4 2 indeed let z 0 0 z 0 0 a 0 where a h is such that a is not of bounded type then kerh zh 2 zh 2 h 2 0 h 2 c 3 thus we obtain a solution for m 2 although there exists no solution for m 1 let be an inner function with values in b e e in view of remark 6 4 we may ask how to determine a possible dimension of d for which there exists a solution l 2 s b d e of the equation kerh h 2 e in fact if we have a solution l 2 s b d e of the equation kerh h 2 e then a solution l 2 s d e also exists if d is a separable complex hilbert space containing d indeed if 0 denotes the zero operator in b d d e and 0 then it follows from lemma 4 3 that kerh kerh thus we would like to ask what is the infimum of dimd such that there exists a solution l 2 s b d e of the equation kerh h 2 e to answer this question we introduce a notion of the beurling degree for an inner function by employing a canonical decomposition of strong l 2 functions induced by the given inner function definition 6 5 let be an inner function with values in b e e then the beurling degree of denoted by degb is defined by degb inf dimd z a pair a b such that a b is a canonical decomposition of l 2 s b d e note by corollary 6 3 degb is well defined indeed 1 degb 1 dime in particular if e 0 then degb 1 also if is a unitary operator then clearly degb 1 we are ready for theorem 6 6 the beurling degree and the spectral multiplicity given an inner function with values in b e e with dime let t s e h then 6 6 t degb 6 the beurling degree 57 proof let t s e h we first claim that 6 7 degb inf dimd kerh h 2 e for some l 2 s b d e with d 6 0 to see this let be an inner function with values in b e e with dime suppose that a b is a canonical decomposition of in l 2 s b d e then by the uniqueness of in theorem 5 1 we have 6 8 kerh h 2 e which implies 6 9 degb inf dimd kerh h 2 e for some l 2 s b d e with d 6 0 for the reverse inequality of 6 9 suppose l 2 s b d e satisfies kerh h 2 e then by the same argument as in the proof of the first assertion of theorem 5 1 a b a and b a is a canonical decomposition of and hence we have the reverse inequality of 6 9 this proves the claim 6 7 we will next show that 6 10 degb t if t then 6 10 is trivial suppose p t then there exists a subset g g 1 g 2 gp h 2 e such that e g h put z g then by lemma 3 6 h 2 s b cp e it thus follows from lemma 4 7 that h e g cl ranhz g cl ranh which implies kerh h 2 e thus by 6 7 degb p t which proves 6 10 for the reverse inequality of 6 10 suppose that r dime write m 0 degb then it follows from theorem 6 1 and 6 7 that m 0 r 1 and there exists a function l 2 s b cm 0 e such that 6 11 kerh h 2 cr now let g 0 thus we may write g zf for some f h 2 s b cm 0 e then by lemma 4 1 and lemma 4 7 we have that e f cl ranhg kerh h which implies t m 0 degb this completes the proof corollary 6 7 let t s e h if rank i t t then t degb 58 6 the beurling degree proof this follows at once from theorem 6 6 together with the observation that if is an inner function with values in b e e then dim e dim e rank i t t where the second equality comes from the model theorem cf p 6 paragraph containing 1 4 remark 6 8 we conclude with some observations on theorem 6 6 a from a careful analysis of the proof of theorem 6 6 we can see that 6 10 holds in general without the assumption dim e more concretely given an inner function with values in b e e if t s e h then degb t b from remark 6 4 and 6 7 we see that if z 0 0 0 z 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 then degb 2 let t s c 4 h observe that h h z h z 0 h 2 since h z h z has no cyclic vector we must have t 6 1 in fact if we put f 1 0 0 a and g 0 1 0 0 where a is not of bounded type then e f g h which implies t 2 this illustrates theorem 6 6 we now answer question 1 1 ii in the affirmative remark 6 9 suppose is an inner function with values in b e e with dime if a b is a canonical decomposition of in l 2 s b d e then by theorem 5 1 we have kerh h 2 e it thus follows from the proof of theorem 6 6 that e f h where f is defined by f z z z 0 this gives an answer to the problem of describing the set f in h 2 e such that h e f given an inner function with values in b e e with dim e chapter 7 the spectral multiplicity of model operators in this chapter we consider question 1 6 let t s e h for which inner function with values in b e e does it follow that t is multiplicity free i e t 1 if dime then in the viewpoint of theorem 6 6 question 1 6 is equivalent to the following if t is the truncated backward shift s e h which inner function guarantees that degb 1 to answer question 1 6 in section 7 1 we consider the notion of the characteristic scalar inner function of operator valued inner functions having a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de z 1 z in section 7 2 we give an answer to question 1 6 in section 7 3 we consider a reduction to the case of c 0 contractions for the spectral multiplicity of model operators 7 1 characteristic scalar inner functions in this section we consider the characteristic scalar inner functions of operator valued inner functions by using the results of section 4 5 the characteristic scalar inner function of a two sided inner matrix function has been studied in hel sfbk and chl 3 let h b d e have a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de then by lemma 4 23 there exists a scalar inner function such that h 2 e kerh put g h b e d if further is inner then g id so that g c d g id for some g h b e d always exists thus the following definition makes sense definition 7 1 let be an inner function with values in b d e if has a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de define m g c d g id for some g h b e d where is a scalar inner function the inner functionm is called the characteristic scalar inner function of we note that if t ph se h c 0 then m coincides with the minimal annihilator mt of t cf ber sfbk chl 3 59 60 7 the spectral multiplicity of model operators we would like to remark that 7 1 g c d g id for some g h b e d may exist for some inner function having no meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de to see this let 7 2 f g f g h where f and g are given in example 3 11 then is an inner function since f is not of bounded type it follows from corollary 4 27 that has no meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de on the other hand since is inner by the complementing lemma there exists a function g h m 1 2 such that g is a scalar inner function so that 7 1 exists if is an n n square inner matrix function then we may write ij b ij where ij is inner and ij and bij h are coprime for each i j 1 2 n in lemma 4 12 of chl 3 it was shown that m l c m ij i j 1 2 n in this section we examine the cases of general inner functions that have meromor phic pseudo continuations of bounded type in de on the other hand if h b d e has a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de then by lemma 4 23 h 2 e kerh for some scalar inner function thus we may also define g c d h 2 e kerh for some scalar inner function if is an inner function with values in b d e and has a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de then is called the pseudo characteristic scalar inner function of note that m is an inner divisor of if further is two sided inner then 7 3 h 2 e kerh g h b e g g ie which implies m the following lemma shows a way to determine more easily lemma 7 2 let d and e be separable complex hilbert spaces and let dj and ei be orthonormal bases ofd and e respectively suppose h b d e has a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de in view of proposition 4 25 we may write ij dj ei e ijaij where ij is inner and ij and aij h are coprime then we have l c m ij i j 1 2 proof let h b d e have a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de by lemma 4 23 we may write a for some a h b e d and a scalar inner function also by an analysis of the proof of proposition 4 25 we can see that 0 l c m ij i j 1 2 is an inner divisor of thus by lemma 4 23 0 is an inner divisor of since h b d e it follows that for all f h 2 e and j n 1 7 4 z dj zn 0 z f z e l 2 7 the spectral multiplicity of model operators 61 on the other hand for all f h 2 e 7 5 f z i 1 f z ei ei i 1 fi z ei for almost all z t fi h 2 since 0 l c m ij i j 1 2 it follows from 7 4 and 7 5 that for all j n 1 t z dj zn 0 z f z edm z t zn i 1 fi z 0 z ij z aij z dm z 0 where the last equality follows from the fact that zn i 1 fi z 0 z ij z aij z l 2 h 2 since di is an orthonormal basis for d it follows from fatou s lemma that for all x d and n 1 2 3 t z x zn 0 z f z edm z 0 thus by lemma 4 3 0 h 2 e kerh so that is an inner divisor of 0 and therefore 0 this complete the proof corollary 7 3 let be a two sided inner matrix function thus in view of corollary 4 27 we may write ijbij where ij is an inner function and ij and bij h are coprime for each i j 1 2 then m l c m ij i j 1 2 proof immediate from lemma 7 2 remark 7 4 if is not two sided inner then corollary 7 3 may fail to see this let 1 2 1 z then by corollary 4 27 has a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de it thus follows from lemma 7 2 that z on the other hand let g 2 0 then g 1 so that m 1 6 z note that by corollary 7 3 c 1 2 1 1 z z and m c c z the following lemma shows that remark 7 4 is not an accident lemma 7 5 let be an inner function and have a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de then m c c and c has a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in d e in this case c is an inner divisor of 62 7 the spectral multiplicity of model operators proof suppose that is an inner function with values in b d e and has a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de then it follows from corollary 4 20 and lemma 4 22 that c is two sided inner on the other hand it follows from lemma 4 5 that kerh c h 2 d d kerh c thus by lemma 4 23 c has a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de and m c c this proves the first assertion since c has a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in d e it follows from lemma 4 23 that c has a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de on the other hand by lemma 4 5 b c 0 thus by lemma 4 5 a h 2 d ker c cch 2 d which implies that cc is a left inner divisor of thus cc c is a left inner divisor of c so that c cc c is an inner divisor of c this proves the second assertion 7 2 multiplicity free model operators in this section we give an answer to question 1 6 this is accomplished by several lemmas lemma 7 6 let h b d e have a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de then for each cyclic vector g of s d kerh z g ker where z g denotes the flip of z g proof let h b d e have a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de then by lemma 4 23 there exists a scalar inner function such that h 2 e kerh we thus have 7 6 h h 2 d for any h h 2 e let g be a cyclic vector of s d and h kerh z g then it follows from lemma 4 3 that for all n 1 2 3 0 t z z g z zn z h z e dm z t s n 1 d g z z z h z d dm z s n 1 d g z z z h z l 2 d which implies by 7 6 that h 0 and hence h ker we thus have kerh zg ker the reverse inclusion follows at once from lemma 4 3 this completes the proof 7 the spectral multiplicity of model operators 63 lemma 7 7 let h b d e have a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de then for each cyclic vector g of s d 7 7 e g h i c where i denotes the inner part in the inner outer factorization of hence in particular s e h i c is multiplicity free proof let i e be the inner outer factorization of since e has dense range e is one one so that ker ker i it thus follows from lemma 4 5 lemma 4 7 and lemma 7 6 that e g kerh z g ker h i c which proves 7 7 this completes the proof the following corollary is a matrix valued version of lemma 7 7 corollary 7 8 let be an n r inner matrix function such that is of bounded type if g is a cyclic vector of s cr then e g h c proof it follows from corollary 4 27 and lemma 7 7 the following lemma shows that the flip of the adjoint of an inner function may be an outer function lemma 7 9 let be an inner function with values in b d e with its com plementary factor c with values in b d e if dimd then c is an outer function proof if d 0 then this is trivial suppose that d cp for some p 1 write 7 8 c c i c e inner outer factorization where c i h mp q and c e h b e cq for some q p it thus follows that q rank c i rank c max d rank c c p which implies p q since c i h mp is two sided inner by the complementing lemma there exists a function g h mp and a scalar inner function such that g c i ip thus by 7 8 we have g c ip c e and hence we have ie cg ipg c c e h b cp e thus we have 7 9 ie cg h 2 cp h 2 e it thus follows from lemma 4 5 and 7 9 that c ipg h 2 cp ie cg h 2 cp ker ch 2 cp which implies ipg h 2 cp h 2 cp we thus have ipg h mp so that ipg h mp therefore we may write g ipg 1 for some g 1 h mp it thus follows that ip g c i ipg 1 c i 64 7 the spectral multiplicity of model operators which gives that g 1 c i ip therefore we have 7 10 h 2 cp c ig 1 h 2 cp c ih 2 cp which implies that c i is a unitary matrix and so is c i thus c is an outer function this completes the proof corollary 7 10 if is an inner matrix function then tc is an outer function proof immediate from lemma 7 9 remark 7 11 let t s cn h for some non square inner matrix function then corollary 7 8 shows that if c for an inner matrix function such that is of bounded type then t is multiplicity free however the converse is not true in general i e the condition multiplicity free does not guarantee that c to see this let 0 z t then is inner and is of bounded type since t 0 z is not an outer function it follows from corollary 7 10 that 6 c for any inner matrix function let f a 1 t a is not of bounded type then e f h so that t is multiplicity free lemma 7 12 let be an inner function and have a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de if is an outer function and ker 0 then is a unitary operator proof let be an inner function with values in b d e and have a mero morphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de then by lemma 4 22 is of bounded type suppose that is an outer function and ker 0 then by lemma 4 5 corollary 4 20 and lemma 4 22 is two sided inner and so is thus is a unitary operator as desired the following lemma is a key idea for an answer to question 1 6 lemma 7 13 let be an inner function and have a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de if is an outer function then cc proof let be an inner function with values in b d e and have a mero morphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de also suppose is an outer function if ker 0 then the result follows at one from lemma 7 12 assume that ker 6 0 by lemma 4 22 is of bounded type so that by corollary 4 20 c is a two sided inner function with values in b d d e for some nonzero hilbert space d we now claim that 7 11 cc for a two sided inner function with values in b d since cc is a left inner divisor of cf the proof of lemma 7 5 we may write 7 12 cc 7 the spectral multiplicity of model operators 65 for an inner function with values in b d d assume to the contrary that is not two sided inner since has a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de it follows from lemma 4 23 that h 2 e kerh kerh cc for some scalar inner function thus cc h 2 e h 2 d in particular we have h 2 d cc cch 2 d h 2 d and hence h 2 d kerh which implies by lemma 4 23 that has a mero morphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de thus by lemma 4 22 is of bounded type it thus follows from lemma 4 5 that c is two sided inner where c is the complementary factor of with values in b d 1 d for some nonzero hilbert space d 1 on the other hand it follows from 7 12 that for all f h 2 d 1 c cc cf cf c cc cf 0 which implies that d 1 0 a contradiction this proves 7 11 thus we may write 7 13 cc for a two sided inner function with values in b d since is an outer function and is two sided inner it follows from 7 13 that is a unitary operator and so is this completes the proof lemma 7 13 may fail if the condition has a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de is dropped to see this let f g 0 where f and g are given in example 3 11 then is an outer function a straightforward calculation shows that c 0 0 1 and cc 1 0 0 1 0 0 6 note that is not of bounded type thus by corollary 4 27 has no meromor phic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de we are ready to give an answer to question 1 6 theorem 7 14 multiplicity free model operators let t s e h if has a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de and is an outer function then t is multiplicity free 66 7 the spectral multiplicity of model operators proof let t s e h suppose that has a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de and is an outer function if ker 0 then by lemma 7 12 is a unitary operator so that t is multiplicity free if in stead ker 6 0 then by lemma 7 5 c has a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de since is an outer function it follows from lemma 7 13 that cc applying lemma 7 7 with c we can see that t has a cyclic vector i e t is multiplicity free the following corollary is an immediate result of theorem 7 14 corollary 7 15 let t s cn h for an inner matrix function whose flip is of bounded type if t is an outer function then t is multiplicity free proof this follows from theorem 7 14 and corollary 4 27 if is an inner matrix function then the converse of lemma 7 13 is also true corollary 7 16 let be an inner matrix function whose flip is of bounded type then the following are equivalent a t is an outer function b is an outer function c cc d c for some inner matrix function hence in particular ccc c proof the implication a b is clear and the implication b c follows from corollary 4 27 and lemma 7 13 also the implication c d is clear and the implication d a follows from corollary 7 10 the second assertion follows from the first assertion together with corollary 4 20 and corollary 7 10 7 3 a reduction to the case of c 0 contractions on the other hand the theory of spectral multiplicity for c 0 operators has been well developed in terms of their characteristic functions cf ni 1 appendix 1 however this theory is not applied directly to c 0 operators in which cases their characteristic functions need not be two sided inner the object of this section is to show that if the characteristic function of a c 0 operator t has a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de then its spectral multiplicity can be computed by that of the c 0 operator induced by t we first observe lemma 7 17 if l 2 b d e and f h d then f l 2 e proof suppose l 2 b d e and f h d since f is strongly mea surable there exist countable valued functions fn k 1 d n k n k such that f z limn fn z for almost all z t for all e e and n 1 2 3 7 14 z fn z e e k 1 n k z z d n k e d 7 the spectral multiplicity of model operators 67 but since is wot measurable by 7 14 fn is weakly measurable and in turn f t e is weakly measurable and hence it is strongly measurable observe that t z f z 2 edm z f t z 2 dm z which implies that f l 2 e this completes the proof lemma 7 18 let l 2 b d e and let a h 2 d h 2 e be a densely defined operator with domain h d h 2 d defined by af jp f f h d then kera kerh proof let l 2 b d e l 2 s b d e since the domain of h is a subset of the domain of a it follows that the domain of a is a subset of the domain of h so that kera kerh for the reverse inclusion suppose g kerh then 7 15 h p g l 2 e 0 for all p pd let f h d be arbitrary then we may write f z k 0 akz k ak d let pn z n k 0 akz k pd then it follows from 7 15 that 0 lim n h pn g l 2 e lim n pn jg l 2 d f jg l 2 e af g l 2 e which implies that g kera so that kerh kera this completes the proof corollary 7 19 if h 2 b d e then e cl jp z h h h d proof define a h 2 d h 2 e by af jp z h h h d by lemma 7 18 kerh z kera by 4 8 we have e cl ranhz cl rana cl jp z h h h d we thus have 68 7 the spectral multiplicity of model operators lemma 7 20 suppose is a two sided inner function and has a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de let f f 1 f 2 fp h then e f p h

in de let f f 1 f 2 fp h write f f 1 f 2 fp and since fj h 2 b c e for each j 1 2 p it is easy to see that f h 2 b cp e we first claim that 7 16 e f cl jp z f h h h cp h ip by corollary 7 19 we have e f cl jp z f h h h cp cl jp z f h h h cp h ip for the reverse inclusion it suffices to show that 7 17 p z f h 0 for all h h cp by lemma 4 23 we may write a for some a h b e since is two sided inner it follows that ie a a so that h 2 e ah 2 e h 2 e we thus have h h ie thus fj h ie j 1 p so that fj l 2 e h 2 e hence for all h h cp by lemma 7 17 we have f h l 2 e h 2 e so that z f h h 2 e and hence p z f h 0 which gives 7 17 this proves 7 16 write h h 1 h 2 hp t h cp h ip and hence hj h h thus it follows from 7 16 that e f cl jp z f h h h cp h ip jp z fj hj hj h h j 1 2 p p h jfj hj h h j 1 2 p this completes the proof lemma 7 21 let be an inner function with values in b e e with dime if i e is the inner outer factorization of then we have a i is a two sided inner function with values in b e b e is an inner function with values in b e e 7 the spectral multiplicity of model operators 69 proof let dime r then the inner part i is an r p inner matrix function for some p r thus we have p rank i rank rank r which proves a for b observe e i since is inner we have that ir i e e i but since i is two sided inner so is i thus it follows that e e i i ir which implies that e is an inner function this proves b lemma 7 22 suppose is an inner function with values in b e e with dime and has a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de write 1 e then 1 has a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in d e proof let dime r and let i e be the inner outer factorization of then e i 1 s where 1 e and s i by lemma 7 21 s h mr is square inner and 1 h b cr e is inner since has a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de it follows from lemma 4 23 that there exists a scalar inner function such that h 2 e kerh kerh s 1 thus we have 7 18 s 1 h 2 e h 2 cr since s is square inner it follows from 7 18 that 1 h 2 e sh 2 cr h 2 cr so that h 2 e kerh 1 which implies by lemma 4 23 that 1 has a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de this completes the proof lemma 7 23 let 1 be an inner function with values in b d e and 2 be a two sided inner function with values in b d then h 1 2 h 1 1 h 2 proof the inclusion h 1 h 1 2 is clear and by corollary 3 16 1 h 2 h 1 2 which gives h 1 1 h 2 h 1 2 for the reverse inclusion suppose f h 1 2 let f 1 ph 1 f and f 2 f f 1 then f 2 1 g for some g h 2 d since f h 1 2 it follows from corollary 3 16 that 7 19 2 1 f 1 1 g l 2 d h 2 d since f 1 h 1 it follows from corollary 3 16 that 1 f 1 l 2 d h 2 d thus by corollary 3 15 for all h h 2 d 2 1 f 1 h l 2 d 1 f 1 2 h l 2 d 0 70 7 the spectral multiplicity of model operators which implies that 2 1 f 1 l 2 d h 2 d thus by corollary 3 16 and 7 19 we have g h 2 and hence f 2 1 h 2 therefore we have h 1 2 h 1 1 h 2 this completes the proof we are ready for theorem 7 24 the spectral multiplicity of model operators given an inner function with values in b e e with dim e let t s e h if has a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de then 7 20 t ts where ts is a c 0 contraction of the form ts s e h s with s i hence in particular t dim e proof let t s e h suppose has a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de let s i and write ts s e h s if is two sided inner then s so that t ts suppose that is not two sided inner without loss of generality we may assume that e cr by lemma 7 21 s h mr is square inner thus by 4 16 and proposition 4 29 we have that ts c 0 we will prove that 7 21 t ts write 1 e then it follows from lemma 7 21 and lemma 7 22 that 1 is an inner function having a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de let 7 22 1 s let p ts in view of 1 8 we have p r then there exists a set f f 1 f 2 fp h s such that e f h s since by 7 22 h s h it follows from lemma 7 20 that 7 23 h s p h jfj hj h h j 1 2 p write 1 c h e e e is a subspace of e since 1 is outer it follows from lemma 7 13 that 1 c choose a cyclic vector g of s e then it follows from lemma 7 5 lemma 7 7 and lemma 7 20 that 7 24 h 1 e g cl p h g h h let 1 g 1 f 1 and j 1 fj j 2 3 p now we will show that 7 25 h p j j j h j 1 2 p let h and 0 be arbitrary then by lemma 7 23 we may write 1 1 2 1 h 1 2 h s 7 the spectral

h jfj 1 h s and p 1 p h jfj h 1 since ker ker we have c c thus by 7 24 p h 1 g belongs to h 1 thus it follows from 7 28 that 0 1 p j 1 p 1 p h jfj p h 1 g h 1 thus by 7 24 there exists h 0 h such that 7 29 p h 0 g 0 l 2 e 2 let 1 h 0 h 1 and j hj j 2 3 p it follows from lemma 4 23 that s sa a h mr it thus follows that sf 1 a sf 1 l 2 cr h 2 cr thus we have h 0 1 f 1 h 0 1 1 sf 1 l 2 e h 2 e which implies p h 0 1 f 1 0 therefore p j 1 p j j p h 0 h 1 g 1 f 1 p j 2 p h j 1 fj p h 0 g p h 1 g p j 1 p h j 1 fj since 1 is inner it follows from 7 26 7 27 and 7 29 that p j 1 p j j l 2 e p h 0 g 0 l 2

the reverse inequality let q t then there exists a set f f 1 f 2 fq h such that e f h for each j 1 2 q by lemma 7 23 we can write fj gj 1 j gj h 1 j h s now we will show that 7 30 e h s j j 1 2 q clearly e h s on the other hand since e f h and h 1 is an invariant subspace for s e it follows from lemma 7 20 7 27 and 7 28 that 1 h s p 1 h s s ne 1 j j 1 2 q n 0 1 2 p 1 h s h j 1 j hj h j 1 2 p 1 p h j j hj h j 1 2 p 1 e this proves 7 30 thus we have that ts q t this proves 7 21 the last assertion follows at once from 1 8 since s is square inner this completes the proof corollary 7 25 suppose is an n r inner matrix function whose flip is of bounded type if t s e h then t r proof it follows from corollary 4 27 and theorem 7 24 chapter 8 miscellanea in this chapter by using the preceding results we analyze left and right co primeness the model operator and an interpolation problem for operator valued functions 8 1 left and right coprimeness in this section we consider conditions for the equivalence of left coprime ness and right coprime ness if is a scalar inner function a function a h b e is said to have a scalar inner multiple if there exists a function g h b e such that ga ag ie we write mul a for the set of all scalar inner multiples of a and we define 8 1 ma g c d mul a we note that if is a two sided inner function then by lemma 4 23 and 7 3 the following are equivalent a has a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de b has a scalar inner multiple thus if h b e is two sided inner and has a scalar multiple then m defined in 8 1 coincides with the characteristic function of this justifies the use of the notation ma for 8 1 on the other hand we may ask question 8 1 if a h b d e has a scalar inner multiple does it follow that ma mul a if a is two sided inner with values in b e then the answer to question 8 1 is affirmative indeed by 7 3 mah 2 e h 2 e mul a kerha which implies again by 7 3 that 8 2 ma mul a lemma 8 2 if a h b e is an outer function having a scalar inner multiple then 1 mul a i e a is invertible in h b e 73 74 8 miscellanea proof suppose that a h b e is an outer function having a scalar inner multiple then 8 3 ag ga ie for some g h b e we claim that 8 4 ah 2 e clah 2 e to see this suppose f clah 2 e then there exists a sequence gn in h 2 e such that agn f l 2 e 0 thus we have that 8 5 gagn gf l 2 e g agn f l 2 e 0 it thus follows from 8 3 and 8 5 that gn gf l 2 e gn gf l 2 e gagn gf l 2 e 0 but since h 2 e is a closed subspace of l 2 e we have g gf h 2 e since a h b e it follows that agn ag l 2 e a gn g l 2 e 0 which implies that f ag ah 2 e this proves 8 4 since a is an outer function it follows from 8 4 that ah 2 e clah 2 e clape h 2 e so that 8 6 ah 2 e h 2 e we thus have that h 2 e g ah 2 e gh 2 e which implies that g 1 g h b e it thus follows from 8 3 that ag 1 g 1 a ie which gives the result we are tempted to guess that 8 6 holds for every outer function a inh b e however the following example shows that this is not such a case example 8 3 let a diag 1 n h b 2 then 1 1 2 1 3 t ah 2 2 so that ah 2 2 6 h 2 2 now we will show that a is an outer function let f h 2 2 and 0 be arbitrary then we may write f z n 0 cnz n cn 2 thus there exists m 0 such that 8 7 n m cnz n l 2 2 2 write f 1 z m 1 n 0 cnz n and f 2 z n m cnz n 8 miscellanea 75 for each n 0 1 2 m 1 write cn a 1 n a 2 n a 3 n t an c then there exists n 0 such that 8 8 k n 1 a k n 2 1 2 2 m for each n 0 1 2 m 1 let p z m 1 n 0 bnz n bn a 1 n 2 a 2 n 3 a 3 n na n n 0 0 t then it follows from 8 7 and 8 8 that f z ap z l 2 2 f 1 z f 2 z ap z l 2 2 f 1 z ap z l 2 2 f 2 z l 2 2 2 m m 2 which implies that a is an outer function lemma 8 4 if a h b e has a scalar inner multiple then a ai is two sided inner and has a scalar inner multiple with mul a mul ai b 1 mul ae proof suppose that a h b e has a scalar inner multiple i e mul a then there exist a function g h b e such that 8 9 ag ga ie thus a z and g z are invertible for almost all z t write a aiae inner outer factorization since a z is invertible for almost all z t ai z is onto for almost all z t so that ai is two sided inner also ae z is injective for almost all z t by 8 9 ae z g z z ai z which implies that ae z is onto and hence invertible for almost all z t thus aeg z is invertible for almost all z t we thus have that ai aeg ag ie a eg ai which implies that ai has a scalar inner multiple i e mul ai this proves a also observe that gai ae ie a e gai which implies that ae has a scalar inner multiple thus by lemma 8 2 1 mul ae this proves b lemma 8 5 if a h b e has a scalar inner multiple then mul a mul ai 76 8 miscellanea proof in view of lemma 8 4 a it suffices to show that mul ai mul a to see this let mul ai then aig gai ie for some g h b e put g 0 a e 1 g then by lemma 8 4 g 0 h b e and ag 0 a iae ae 1 g ie but since a has a scalar inner multiple a z is invertible for almost all z t thus we have mul a this proves mul ai mul a this completes the proof the following corollary gives an affirmative answer to question 8 1 corollary 8 6 if a h b e has a scalar inner multiple then ma mul a proof by lemma 8 4 ai is two sided inner by 8 2 mai mul ai thus it follows from lemma 8 5 that ma mai mul ai mul a the following lemma is elementary lemma 8 7 let e be a complex hilbert space if and are scalar inner functions then left g c d ie ie g c d ie proof let left g c d ie ie and g c d then we can write 1 and 1 where 1 and 1 are coprime inner functions thus we have h 2 e h 2 e h 2 e 1 h 2 e 1 h 2 e 1 h 2 e 1 h 2 e h 2 e which implies that ie this completes the proof lemma 8 8 let a h b e have a scalar inner multiple and be a scalar inner function suppose that ma is not an inner divisor of if 0 mul a is such that a and ie g c d 0 ie are left coprime then 0 mul a proof let a h b e have a scalar inner multiple and be a scalar inner function suppose that ma is not an inner divisor of then we should have 1 mul a thus by lemma 8 2 a is not an outer function so that ai is not a unitary operator let 0 mul a be such that a and ie g c d 0 ie are left coprime then by lemma 8 7 we may write 8 10 1 and 0 1 8 miscellanea 77 where 1 and 1 are coprime scalar inner functions on the other hand since 0 mul a we have that 8 11 0 ie ga ag for some g h b e thus by 8 10 and 8 11 we have that g ie a ie ga 1 ie h b e which implies that 8 12 ah 2 e kerhg ie h 2 e thus is a left inner divisor of a since also h 2 e kerhg ie h 2 e is a left inner divisor of ie thus is a common left inner divisor of a and ie so that by our assumption is a unitary operator thus kerhg ie h 2 e h 2 e which implies that ieg h b e on the other hand by 8 10 and 8 11 we have 1 ie 0 ie ieg a a ieg which implies that 1 0 mul a this completes the proof we then have theorem 8 9 let a h b e and be a scalar inner function if a has a scalar inner multiple then the following are equivalent a and ma are coprime b ie and a are left coprime c ie and a are right coprime proof let a h b e have a scalar inner multiple write a aiae inner outer factorization a b suppose that ie and a are not left coprime then h 2 e aih 2 e 6 h 2 e by corollary 8 6 there exists g h b e such that ga ag maie thus we have that left g c d ie maie h 2 e h 2 e agh 2 e h 2 e aih 2 e 6 h 2 e which implies that ie and maie are not left coprime thus by lemma 8 7 and ma are not coprime b a suppose that and ma are not coprime if ma is an inner divisor of then by corollary 8 6 and lemma 8 7 we may write ie ma 1 ie a iaeg 1 ie g h b e 1 is a scalar inner thus ai is a common left inner divisor of ie and a if a i is a unitary operator then a is an outer function it thus follows from lemma 8 2 that ma 1 so that and ma are coprime a contradiction therefore a i is not a unitary operator 78 8 miscellanea and hence ie and a are not left coprime suppose instead that ma is not an inner divisor of write g c d ma 6 1 we then claim that 8 13 a and ie are not left coprime towards 8 13 we assume to the contrary that a and ie are left coprime then it follows from corollary 8 6 and lemma 8 8 that ma mul a which contradicts the definition of ma this proves 8 13 but since is an inner divisor of it follows from lemma 8 7 that a and ie is not left coprime b c since mul a if and only if mul a it follows that m a ma it thus follows from a b this completes the proof corollary 8 10 let be an inner function with values in b d e and be a scalar inner function if has a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de then the following are equivalent a and are coprime b ie and c are left coprime c ie and c are right coprime proof suppose that has a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de then by lemma 4 22 is of bounded type so that by corollary 4 20 c is two sided inner thus the result follows from theorem 8 9 and lemma 7 5 example 8 11 let b 0 0 b 0 0 6 0 6 0 then zi 3 and are not left coprime because zh 2 c 3 h 2 c 2 6 h 2 c 3 but zi 3 and c are left coprime so that by corollary 8 10 z and are coprime indeed we note that kerh c h 2 c 3 and hence b b the following example shows that if the condition a has a scalar inner mul tiple is dropped in theorem 8 9 then theorem 8 9 may fail example 8 12 let z se e 2 z then is an inner function not two sided inner an isometric operator with values in b e for f h 2 e we can write f z n 0 anz n an e we thus have that f z s n 0 anz n n 0 s an z n 8 miscellanea 79 thus h 2 e h 2 e so that and ie are right coprime for all scalar inner function let z z 1 1 a scalar inner then f z s n 0 anz n n 0 san z n we thus have h 2 e h 2 e h 2 e z 1 h 2 e h 2 e zh 2 e 6 h 2 e which implies that ie and are not left coprime note that has no scalar inner multiple on the other hand since kerh h 2 e we have 1 thus it follows from corollary 8 10 that ie and c are left and right coprime for all scalar inner function lemma 8 13 if h mn is an inner function then 8 14 and m are coprime and det are coprime proof if h mn is inner then m mul so that we may write m in g for some inner function g h mn thus det detg mn if and m are coprime then and m n are coprime so that and det are coprime conversely suppose that and det are coprime since det in adj it follows that det mul thus m is an inner divisor of det and hence and m are coprime this proves 8 14 we can recapture chl 3 theorem 4 16 corollary 8 14 let a h 2 mn and be a scalar inner function then the following are equivalent a and deta are coprime b in and a are left coprime c in and a are right coprime proof if h mn is inner then by theorem 8 9 and lemma 8 13 we have 8 15 in and are left coprime and det are coprime we now write a aiae inner outer factorization now we will show that if b or c holds then ai is two sided inner indeed if b or c holds then by chl 3 lemma 4 15 deta 6 0 so that a z is invertible and hence ai z is onto for almost all z t thus ai is two sided inner then by the helson lowdenslager theorem cf ni 1 p 22 we have that deta detai detae inner outer factorization it thus follows from 8 15 that in and a are left coprime in and ai are left coprime and detai are coprime and deta are coprime 80 8 miscellanea for right coprime ness we apply the above result and the fact that deta d eta 8 2 the model operator we recall that the model theorem p 6 states that if t b h is a contraction such that limn t nx 0 for each x h i e t c 0 then there exists a unitary imbedding v h h 2 e with e cl ran i tt such that vh h for some inner function with values in b e e and 8 16 t v s e h v we may now ask what is a necessary and sufficient condition for dim e in the model theorem in this section we give a necessary condition for the finite dimensionality of e for an inner function with values in b e e define 8 17 h 0 f h lim n ph s n ef 0 then h 0 is a closed subspace of h and in this case write e 0 h h 0 then e 0 is an invariant subspace of s e so that there exists an inner function s h b e 1 e such that 8 18 e 0 h s we then have lemma 8 15 let be an inner function with values in b e e then s 1 for some two sided inner function 1 with values in b e e 1 proof observe that h 2 e h 2 e e 0 h 0 thus h 2 e h 2 e e 0 sh 2 e 1 which implies that s 1 for some inner function 1 with values in b e e 1 we must show that 1 is two sided we first claim that 8 19 f sh 2 e 1 f l 2 e f l 2 e indeed since limn ie p snef l 2 e 0 for each f h 2 e a straightforward calculation shows that lim n ph snef 2 l 2 e f 2 l 2 e f 2 l 2 e giving 8 19 thus for all x e 1 with x 1 1 sx l 2 e sx l 2 e 1 x l 2 e which says that t 1 z x 2 dm z 1 8 miscellanea 81 but since 1 z x 1 it follows that 1 z x 1 a e on t so that 1 z is isometry for almost all z t and therefore 1 is two sided inner this completes the proof we then have theorem 8 16 let t b h be a contraction such that limn t nx 0 for each x h and have a characteristic function with values in b e e then sup d dim f f h 0 dime whereh 0 is defined by 8 17 in particular if dime then max d dim f f h 0 is finite proof it follows from 8 18 and lemma 8 15 that h 0 h e 0 h h s sh 2 e we thus have sup d dim f f h 0 sup d dim s g g h 2 e dime 8 3 an interpolation problem in the literature many authors have considered the special cases of the follow ing scalar valued or operator valued interpolation problem cf co 1 chl 2 chl 3 ff ga gu ghr hkl hl 1 hl 2 nt zh problem 8 17 for l b e when does there exist a function k h b e with k 1 satisfying 8 20 k h b e if is a matrix valued rational function this question reduces to the classical hermite feje r interpolation problem for notational convenience we write for l b e c k h b e k h b e we then have theorem 8 18 let l b e if c is nonempty then kerh kerh in particular nc nc 82 8 miscellanea proof suppose c 6 then there exists a function k h b e such that k h b e then h t k h which implies that kerh kerh but since l b e it follows that h h h and h h h we thus have kerh kerh on the other hand it follows from lemma 4 4 that 8 21 h 2 e kerh kerh kerh h 2 e for some inner functions and with values in b e e and b e e respec tively thus is a left inner divisor of so that we have dime dime which implies by theorem 4 10 that nc nc corollary 8 19 let l b e and c 6 if is of bounded type then is of bounded type proof suppose that l b e then by lemma 3 13 l b e thus is a strong l 2 function and so is assume that c 6 and is of bounded type then it follows from theorem 8 18 and lemma 4 4 that 8 22 h 2 e kerh kerh h 2 e for some two sided inner function with values in b e and an inner function with values in b e e thus is a left inner divisor of and hence by lemma 3 12 is two sided inner so that is of bounded type chapter 9 some unsolved problems in this paper we have explored the beurling lax halmos theorem and have tried to answer several outstanding questions in this process we have gotten interesting results on a canonical decomposition of strong l 2 functions a connection between the beurling degree and the spectral multiplicity and the multiplicity free model operators however there are still open questions in which we are interested in this chapter we pose several unsolved problems 9 1 the beurling degree of an inner matrix functions the theory of spectral multiplicity for operators of the class c 0 has been well developed see ni 1 appendix 1 sfbk for an inner matrix function h mn and k 0 1 n let 9 1 k g c d all inner parts of the minors of order n k of then it is well known that if t c 0 with characteristic function h mn then 9 2 t min k k k 1 in fact the proof for in 9 2 is not difficult but the proof for is so complicated however theorem 6 6 gives a simple proof for in 9 2 with the aid of the moore nordgren theorem to see this we recall that for an inner function k k 1 2 with values in mn 1 and 2 are called quasi equivalent if there exist functions x y h mn such that x 1 2 y and such that the inner parts detx i and det y i of the corresponding determinants are coprime to det k i k 1 2 the following theorem shows that the spectral multiplicity of c 0 operators with square inner characteristic functions can be computed by studying diagonal characteristic functions cf no mn ni 1 nordgren moore theorem a let k k 1 2 be an inner function with values in mn and let tk ph scn h k k 1 2 if 1 and 2 are quasi equivalent then t 1 t 2 b let be an inner function with values inmn then is quasi equivalent to a unique diagonal inner function diag 0 1 1 2 n 1 n 83 84 9 some unsolved problems by the nordgren moore theorem a and theorem 6 6 we can see that if 1 and 2 are quasi equivalent square inner matrix functions then 9 3 degb 1 degb 2 we now have proposition 9 1 if is an n n square inner matrix function then 9 4 degb min k k k 1 proof let m min k k k 1 then by the nordgren moore theorem is quasi equivalent to diag 0 1 m 1 m 1 1 we now take 0 1 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 m 1 m 0 0 1 0 0 1 h mn m then a direct calculation shows that kerh m k 1 k 1 k h 2 h 2 cn m h 2 cn it thus follows from 6 7 and 9 3 that degb degb m corollary 9 2 if is a diagonal inner matrix function of the form diag 1 n where each i is a scalar inner function then degb max card 1 n g c d i i 6 1 proof this follows at once from 9 2 and theorem 6 6 now proposition 9 1 together with theorem 6 6 gives a simple proof for in 9 2 consequently in 9 4 we may take in place of however we were unable to derive a similar formula to 9 4 for non square inner matrix function thus we would like to pose problem 9 3 if is an n m inner matrix function describe degb in terms of its entries e g minors 9 2 spectra of model operators we recall that if is a scalar inner function then we may write b exp t z z d z 9 some unsolved problems 85 where b is a blaschke product and is a singular measure on t and that the spectrum of is defined by cld 1 can be continued analytically into a neighborhood of then it was ni 1 p 63 known that the spectrum of is given by 9 5 cl 1 0 supp it was also cf ni 1 p 72 known that if t ph se h c 0 then 9 6 t m in view of 9 6 we may ask what is the spectrum of the model operator s e h here is an answer proposition 9 4 let t s e h for an inner function with values in b d e if has a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de and is the pseudo characteristic scalar inner function of then 9 7 t proof if c is the complementary factor with values in b d e of then by the proof of lemma 7 5 c is two sided inner and has a meromor phic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de thus by proposition 4 29 s e h c belongs to c 0 then by the model theorem we have s e h c ph c se h c it thus follows from lemma 7 5 and 9 6 that 9 8 s e h c m c on the other hand observe c h 2 d d h 2 d ch 2 d and hence h h c ch 2 d thus we may write 9 9 t t 1 0 t 2 h c ch 2 d h c ch 2 d note that t 1 s e h c since by 9 5 and 9 8 t 1 has no interior points so that t 1 t 2 has no interior points thus we have t t 1 t 2 because in the banach space setting the passage from a c 0 b to a b is the filling in certain holes in a c 0 b occurring in a b cf hll therefore by 9 8 we have t we would like to pose problem 9 5 if t s e h for an inner function having a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de describe the spectrum of t in terms of the pseudo characteristic scalar inner function of 86 9 some unsolved problems 9 3 the spectral multiplicity of model operators it was known cf ni 1 p 41 that if t s e h for an inner function with values in b e e with dim e then t dim e 1 theorem 7 24 says that if has a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de then t dim e however we were unable to find an example showing that theorem 7 24 may fail if the condition has a meromorphic pseudo continuation of bounded type in de is dropped thus we would like to pose problem 9 6 find an example of the operator t s e h for an inner function with values in b e e with dim e satisfying t dim e 1 9 4 the model theorem the model theorem cf p 6 says that if t c 0 i e t b h is a contraction such that limn t nx 0 for each x h then t is unitarily equivalent to the truncated backward shift s e h with the characteristic function with values in b e e where 9 10 e cl ran i t t however we were unable to determine e in terms of spectral properties of t as in 9 10 in theorem 8 16 we give a necessary condition for dim e thus we would like to pose problem 9 7 let t c 0 and h b e e be the characteristic function of t for which operator t we have dim e 9 5 cowen s theorem and abrahamse s theorem for l b e write e k h b e k h b e and k 1 i e e k c k 1 cf p 81 if dim e 1 and is a scalar valued function then an elegant theorem of c cowen cf co 1 nt cl says that e is nonempty if and only if t is hyponormal i e the self commutator t t is positive semi definite cowen s theorem is to recast the operator theoretic problem of hyponormality into the problem of finding a solution of an interpolation problem in ghr it was shown that the cowen s theorem still holds for a toeplitz operator t with a matrix valued normal i e symbol l mn we then have 9 some unsolved problems 87 problem 9 8 extend cowen s theorem for a toeplitz operator with an operator valued normal symbol l b e we recall that an operator t b h is called subnormal if t has a normal extension i e t n h where n is a normal operator on some hilbert space k h such that h is invariant for n in 1979 p r halmos posed the following problem listed as problem 5 in his lecture ten problems in hilbert space ha 2 ha 3 is every subnormal toeplitz operator t with symbol l either normal or analytic i e h in 1984 c cowen and j long col have answered this question in the negative to date a characterization of subnormality of toeplitz operators t in terms of the symbols has not been found the best partial answer to halmos problem 5 was given by m b abrahamse if l is such that or is of bounded type then t is either normal or analytic this is called abrahamse s theorem very recently in chl 3 theorem 7 3 abrahamse s theorem was extended to the cases of toeplitz operators t with matrix valued symbols under some constraint on the symbols concretely when has a tensored scalar singularity we would like to pose problem 9 9 extend abrahamse s theorem to toeplitz operators t with operator valued symbols l b e bibliography ab m b abrahamse subnormal toeplitz operators and functions of bounded type duke
