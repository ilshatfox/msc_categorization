preface the present volume i represents a manual for parts of the polyfold theory which has been prompted by the analytical problems of the symplectic field theory sft a general theory of symplectic invariants outlined in 5 the sft constructs invariants of symplectic cobordisms by analyzing the struc ture of solutions of elliptic partial differential equations of cauchy riemann type from riemann surfaces into compact symplectic manifolds the partial differential equations are defined on varying domains and map into varying targets the occurring singular limits like bubbling off phenomena give rise to serious compactness and transversality problems although such nonlin ear problems could be approached by ad hoc methods the polyfold theory is a systematic and efficient approach providing a language and a large body of results for dealing with nonlinear elliptic equations involving compactness and transversality issues it requires however a generalization of the dif ferential geometry and of the nonlinear fredholm theory to a class of spaces which are more general than manifolds these spaces have locally varying dimensions and are described locally by retracts on decreasing sequence of banach spaces replacing the open sets of banach spaces in the familiar local description of manifolds as a guide to the literature these notes provide precise definitions and formulate the important results they also provide many proofs but refer otherwise to the papers 2 16 20 27 the main topic in the current volume i is the development of all aspects of the fredholm theory in a class of spaces called m polyfolds these spaces can be viewed as a gen eralization of the notion of a manifold finite or infinite dimensional in volume ii the ideas will be generalized to the more general class of spaces called polyfolds which is needed in the more advanced applications vol ume i and ii describe a wide array of nonlinear functionalanalytic tools to study perturbation and transversality questions for a large class of so called fredholm sections in a planned volume iii we intend to describe a wide array of nonlinear analysis tools to construct polyfolds in applications in particular the set up will emphasize recyclability of the analysis and we shall put forward a novel theory black boxes which allows to recycle different pieces of analysis and guarantees that these work together provided they volume iii will with all likelihood absorb our unpublished manuscript 19 4 have some easy to check properties other approaches do not address the issue of recyclability the latter is a serious issue since as is well known currently the proofs in symplectic geometry are very long and usually not very transparent so that mistakes very often go undetected the series of videos 15 1 43

space 1 1 sc structures and differentiability we begin with the linear sc theory definition 1 1 a sc structure or scale structure on a banach space e consists of a decreasing sequence em m 0 of banach spaces e e 0 e 1 e 2 such that the following two conditions are satisfied 1 the inclusion operators em 1 em are compact 2 the intersection e i 0 ei is dense in every em sc structures where sc is short for scale are known from linear inter polation theory see 41 however our interpretation is that of a smooth structure in the following a sc banach space or a sc smooth banach space stands for a banach space equipped with a sc structure a finite dimensional banach space e has precisely one sc structure namely the constant structure em e for all m 0 if e is an infinite dimensional banach space the constant structure is not a sc structure because it fails property 1 we shall see that the sc structure leads to interesting new phenomena in nonlinear analysis points in e are called smooth points points in em are called points of regularity m a subset a of a sc banach space e inherits a filtration am m 0 defined by am a em it is of course possible that a we adopt the convention that ak stands for the set ak equipped with the induced filtration akm m 0 ak m m 0 the direct sum e f of sc banach spaces is a sc banach space whose sc smooth structure is defined by e f m em fm for all m 0 example 1 2 an example of a sc banach space which is relevant in our applications is as follows we choose a strictly increasing sequence m m 0 of real numbers starting with 0 0 we consider the banach spaces e 6 l 2 r s 1 and em hm m r s 1 where the space hm m r s 1 consists of those elements in e having weak partial derivatives up to order m which if weighted by e m s belong to e using sobolev s compact embedding theorem for bounded domains and the assumption that the sequence m is strictly increasing one sees that the sequence em m 0 defines a sc structure on e definition 1 3 a linear operator t e f between sc banach spaces is called sc operator if t em fm and the induced operators t em fm are continuous for all m 0 a linear sc isomorphism is a bijective sc operator whose inverse is also a sc operator a special class of linear sc operators are sc operators defined as follows definition 1 4 a sc operator s e f between sc banach spaces is called a sc operator if s em fm 1 and s e f 1 is a sc operator in view of definition 1 1 the inclusion operator fm 1 fm is compact implying that a sc operator s e f is a sc compact operator in the sense that s em fm is compact for every m 0 hence given a sc operator t e f and a sc operator s e f the operator t s can be viewed on every level as a perturbation of t by the compact operator s definition 1 5 a subspace f of a sc banach space e is called a sc subspace provided f is closed and the sequence fm m 0 given by fm f em defines a sc structure on f a sc subspace f of the sc banach space e has a sc complement provided there exists an algebraic complement g of f so that gm em g defines an sc structure on g such that on every level m we have a topological direct sum em fm gm such a splitting e f g is called a sc splitting the following result from 20 proposition 2 7 will be used frequently proposition 1 6 let e be a sc banach space a finite dimensional subspace f of e is a sc subspace if and only if f belongs to e a finite dimensional sc subspace always has a sc complement proof if f e then fm f em f and f is equipped with the constant sc structure so that f is a sc subspace of e conversely if f is a 7 sc subspace then by definition f m 0 fm f e is dense in f consequently f f e since f and f are finite dimensional next let e 1 ek be a basis for a finite dimensional sc subspace f in view of the above discussion ei e by the hahn banach theorem the dual basis can be extended to linear functionals 1 k which are continuous on e and hence on em for every m the map p e e defined by p x 1 i k i x ei has its image in f e it induces a continuous map from em to em and since p p p it is a sc projection introduce the closed subspace g 1 p e and let gm g em then e f g and gm 1 gm the set g m 0 gm g e is also dense in gm indeed if g gm we find a sequence fn e such that fn g in em setting gn 1 p fn g we have gn 1 p g g as claimed consequently gm m 0 defines a sc structure on g and the proof of the proposition is complete next we describe the quotient construction in the sc framework proposition 1 7 assume that e is a sc banach space and a e a sc subspace then e a equipped with the filtration em am is a sc banach space note that em am x a em x e proof by definition of a sc subspace the filtration on a is given by am a em and am em is a closed subspace hence em am em a em x a em x em we identify an element x am in em am with the element x a of e a so that algebraically we can view em am e a the inclusion em 1 em is compact implying that the quotient map em 1 em am is compact we claim that the inclusion map em 1 am 1 em am is compact in order to show this we take a sequence xk am 1 em 1 am 1 satisfying xk am 1 m 1 inf x a m 1 a am 1 1 and choose a sequence ak in am 1 such that xk ak m 1 2 we may assume after taking a subsequence that xk ak x em the image of the sequence xk am 1 under the inclusion em 1 am 1 em am is the 8 sequence xk ak am then xk ak am x am m xk ak x am m inf xk ak x a m a am xk ak x m 0 showing that the inclusion em 1 am 1 em am is compact finally let us show that j 0 ej aj is dense in every em am let us first note that e a j 0 ej aj consists of all elements of the form x a with x e since e is dense in em the image under the continuous quotient map em em am is dense this completes the proof of proposition 1 7 a distinguished class of sc operators is the class of sc fredholm operators definition 1 8 a sc operator t e f between sc banach spaces is called sc fredholm provided there exist sc splittings e k x and f c y having the following properties 1 k is the kernel of t and is finite dimensional 2 c is finite dimensional and y is the image of t 3 t x y is a sc isomorphism in view of proposition 1 6 the definition implies that the kernel k consists of smooth points and t xm ym for all m 0 in particular we have the topological direct sums em k xm and f c t em the index of a sc fredholm operator t denoted by ind t is as usual defined by ind t dim k dim c sc fredholm operators have the following regularizing property proposition 1 9 a sc fredholm operator t e f is regularizing i e if e e satisfies t e fm then e em 9 proof by assumption t e fm c t xm so that t e t x c for some x xm and c c then t e x c and e x e 0 since t e 0 c f 0 it follows that c 0 and e x k e implying that x and e are on the same level m the following stability result will be crucial later on the proof repro duced in appendix 1 4 1 is taken from 20 proposition 2 1 proposition 1 10 compact perturbation let e and f be sc banach spaces if t e f is a sc fredholm operator and s e f a sc operator then t s is also a sc fredholm operator the next concept will be crucial later on for the definition of boundaries definition 1 11 a partial quadrant in a sc banach space e is a closed convex subset c of e such that there exists a sc isomorphism t e rn w satisfying t c 0 n w we now consider tuples u c e in which u is a relatively open subset of the partial quadrant c in the sc banach space e definition 1 12 if u c e and u c e are two such tuples then a map f u u is called sc 0 or of class sc 0 or sc continuous provided f um vm and the induced maps f um vm are continuous for all m 0 definition 1 13 the tangent t u c e of the tuple u c e is defined as the tuple t u c e tu tc te where tu u 1 e tc c 1 e and te e 1 e note that t u c e is a tuple consisting again of a relatively open subset tu in the partial quadrant tc in the sc banach space te sc differentiability is a new notion of differentiability in sc banach spaces which is considerably weaker than the familiar notion of fre chet differentia bility the new notion of differentiability is the following definition 1 14 we consider two tuples u c e and u c e and a map f u u the map f is called sc 1 sc 1 sc 1 or of class sc 1 sc 1 sc 1 provided the following conditions are satisfied 10 1 the map f is sc 0 2 for every x u 1 there exists a bounded linear operator df x e 0 f 0 such that for h e 1 satisfying x h u 1 lim h 1 0 f x h f x df x h 0 h 1 0 3 the map tf tu tu defined by tf x h f x df x h x u 1 and h e is a sc 0 map the map tf tu tu is called the tangent map of f in general the map u 1 l e 0 f 0 defined by x df x will not be continuous if the space of bounded linear operators is equipped with the operator norm however if we equip it with the compact open topology it will be continuous the sc 1 maps between finite dimensional banach spaces are the familiar c 1 maps proceeding inductively we define what it means for the map f to be sck or sc namely a sc 0 map f is said to be a sc 2 map if it is sc 1 and if its tangent map tf tu tv is sc 1 by definition 1 14 and definition 1 13 the tangent map of tf t 2 f t tf t 2 u t tu t 2 v t tv is of class sc 0 if the tangent map t 2 f is sc 1 then f is said to be sc 3 and so on the map f is sc or sc smooth if it is sck for all k 0 remark 1 15 the above consideration can be generalized instead of taking a partial quadrant c one might take a closed convex partial cone p with nonempty interior this means p e is a closed subset so that for a real number 0 it holds p p moreover p is convex and has a nonempty interior if then u is an open subset of p we can define the notion of being sc 1 as in the previous definition the tangent map tf is then defined on tp p 1 e we note that tp is a closed cone with nonempty interior in this context one should be able to deal with sc fedholm problems on m polyfolds with polytopal boundaries and even more general situations many of the results in this book can be carried over to this generality as well but one should check carefully which arguments carry over 11 1 2 properties of sc differentiability in this section we shall discuss the relationship between the classical smooth ness in the fre chet sense and the sc smoothness the proofs of the following results can be found in 25 proposition 1 16 proposition 2 1 25 let u be a relatively open subset of a partial quadrant in a sc banach space e and let f be another sc banach space then a sc 0 map f u f is of class sc 1 if and only if the following conditions hold true 1 for every m 1 the induced map f um fm 1 is of class c 1 in particular the derivative df um l em fm 1 x 7 df x is a continuous map 2 for every m 1 and every x um the bounded linear operator df x em fm 1 has an extension to a bounded linear operator df x em 1 fm 1 in addition the map um em 1 fm 1 x h 7 df x h is continuous in particular if x u is a smooth point in u and f u f is a sc 1 map then the linearization df x e f is a sc operator a consequence of proposition 1 16 is the following result about lifting the indices proposition 1 17 proposition 2 2 25 let u and v be relatively open subsets of partial quadrants in sc banach spaces and let f u v be sck then f u 1 v 1 is also sck 12 proposition 1 18 proposition 2 3 25 let u and v be relatively open subsets of partial quadrants in sc banach spaces if f u v is sck then for every m 0 the map f um k vm is of class ck moreover f um l vm is of class c l for every 0 l k the next result is very useful in proving that a given map between sc banach spaces is sc smooth proposition 1 19 proposition 2 4 25 let u be a relatively open subset of a partial quadrant in a sc banach space e and let f be another sc banach space assume that for every m 0 and 0 l k the map f u v induces a map f um l fm which is of class c l 1 then f is sck 1 in the case that the target space f rn proposition 1 19 takes the following form corollary 1 20 corollary 2 5 25 let u be a relatively open subset of a partial quadrant in a sc banach space and f u rn if for some k and all 0 l k the map f ul rn belongs to c l 1 then f is sck 1 1 3 the chain rule and boundary recognition the cornerstone of the sc calculus the chain rule holds true theorem 1 21 chain rule let u c e and v d f and w q g be relatively open subsets of partial quadrants in sc banach spaces and let f u v and g v w be sc 1 maps then the composition g f u w is also sc 1 and t g f tg tf the result is proved in 20 as theorem 2 16 for open sets u v and w we give the adaptation to the somewhat more general setting here the proof which is given in appendix 1 4 2 is very close to the one in 20 and does not require any new ideas remark 1 22 the result is somewhat surprising since differentiability is only guaranteed under the loss of one level u 1 f 0 so that one might expect for a composition a loss of two levels however one is saved by the compactness of the embeddings em 1 em 13 the next basic result concerns the boundary recognition let c be a par tial quadrant in the sc banach space e we choose a linear sc isomorphism t e rk w satisfying t c 0 k w if x c then t x a 1 ak w 0 k w and we define the integer dc x by dc x i 1 k ai 0 definition 1 23 the map dc c n 0 is called the degeneracy index points x c satisfying dc x 0 are interior points of c the points satisfying dc x 1 are honest boundary points and the points with dc x 2 are corner points the size of the index gives the complexity of the corner it is not difficult to see that this definition is independent of the choice of a sc linear isomorphism t lemma 1 24 the map dc does not depend on the choice of a linear sc isomorphism t the proof is given in appendix 1 4 3 theorem 1 25 given the tuples u c e and u c e and a germ f u x u x of a local sc diffeomorphism satisfying x f x then dc x dc f x the proof of a more general result is given in 20 theorem 1 19 we note that sc smooth diffeomorphisms recognize boundary points and corners whereas homeomorphisms recognize only boundaries but no corners 1 4 appendix 1 4 1 proof of the sc fredholm stability result proof of proposition 1 10 since s em fm is compact for every level the operator t s em fm is fredholm for every m denoting by km the kernel of this operator we claim that km km 1 for every m 0 clearly km 1 km if x km then tx sx fm 1 and hence by proposition 1 9 x em 1 thus x km 1 implying km km 1 so that km km 1 14 set k k 0 by proposition 1 6 k splits the sc space e since it is a finite dimensional subset of e therefore we have the sc splitting e k x for a suitable sc subspace x of e next define y t s e t s x and ym y fm for m 0 since t s e f is fredholm its image y is closed we claim that the set y defined by y m 0 ym y f is dense in ym for every m 0 indeed if y ym then y t s e for some e e since by proposition 1 9 t is regularizing we conclude that e em since e is dense in em there exists a sequence en e such that en e in em then setting yn t s en y we conclude that yn t s e y which shows that y is dense in ym finally we consider the projection map p f f y since p is a continuous surjection onto a finite dimensional space and f is dense in f it follows that p f f y hence we can choose a basis in f y whose representatives belong to f denoting by c the span of these representatives we obtain fm ym c consequently we have a sc splitting f y c and the proof of proposition 1 10 is complete 1 4 2 proof of the chain rule proof of theorem 1 21 the maps f u 1 f and g v 1 g are of class c 1 in view of proposition 1 18 moreover dg f x df x l e g if x u 1 fix x u 1 and h e 1 sufficiently small satisfying x h u 1 and f x h v 1 then using the postulated properties of f and g g f x h g f x dg f x df x h 1 0 dg tf x h 1 t f x f x h f x df x h dt 1 0 dg tf x h 1 t f x dg f x df x h dt the first integral after dividing by h 1 takes the form 1 0 dg tf x h 1 t f x f x h f x df x h h 1 dt 1 for h e 1 such that x h u 1 and h 1 is small we have that tf x h 1 t f x v 1 moreover the maps 0 1 f 1 defined by t 7 tf x h 1 t f x are continuous and converge in c 0 0 1 f 1 to the 15 constant map t 7 f x as h 1 0 since f is of class sc 1 the quotient a h f x h f x df x h h 1 converges to 0 in f 0 as h 1 0 therefore by the continuity assumption 3 in definition 1 14 the map t h 7 dg tf x h 1 t f x a h as a map from 0 1 e 1 into g 0 converges to 0 as h 1 0 uniformly in t consequently the expression in 1 converges to 0 in g 0 as h 1 0 if x h u 1 next we consider the integral 1 0 dg tf x h 1 t f x dg f x df x h h 1 dt 2 by definition 1 1 the inclusion operator e 1 e 0 is compact so that the set of all h h 1 e 1 has a compact closure in e 0 therefore since df x l e 0 f 0 is a continuous map by definition 1 14 the closure of the set of all df x h h 1 is compact in f 0 consequently again by definition 1 14 every sequence hn e 1 satisfying x hn u 1 and hn 1 0 possesses a subsequence having the property that the integrand of the integral in 2 converges to 0 in g 0 uniformly in t hence the integral 2 also converges to 0 in g 0 as h 1 0 and x h u 1 we have proved that g f x h g f x dg f x df x h 0 h 1 0 as h 1 0 and x h u 1 consequently condition 2 of definition 1 14 is satisfied for the composition g f with the linear operator d g f x dg f x df x l e 0 g 0 where x u 1 we conclude that the tangent map t g f tu tg x h 7 g f x d g f x h is sc continuous and moreover t g f tg tf the proof of theorem 1 21 is complete 16 1 4 3 proof lemma 1 24 proof of lemma 1 24 we take a second sc isomorphism t e rk w satisfying t c 0 k w and first show that k k we consider the composition s t t 1 rk w rk w where s is a sc isomorphism mapping 0 k w 0 k w we claim that s 0 k w 0 k w indeed suppose s 0 w a w for some a w 0 k w then we conclude s 0 tw ts 0 w t a w ta tw 0 k w for all t r consequently a 0 hence s 0 k w 0 k w and since s is an isomorphim we obtain equality of these sets the set 0 k w w has codimension k in rk w and since s is an isomorphism we have s rk w s rk 0 s 0 k w s rk 0 0 k w so that the codimension of 0 k w in rk w is equal to k on the other hand this codimension is equal to k hence k k as claimed to prove our result it now suffices to show that if x a w 0 k w and y s x a w then i x i y 3 where i x is the set of indices 1 i k for which xi 0 the set i y is defined similarly with i x we associate the subspace ex of rk w ex b v rk w bi 0 for all i i x the set e y is defined analogously observe that i x is equal to the codi mension of ex in rk w in order to prove 3 it is enough to show that s ex e y if this is the case then since s is an isomorphism we obtain s ex e y which shows that the codimensions of ex and e y in rk w and rk w respectively are the same now to see that s ex e y we take u b v ex and note that x tu 0 w for t small then s x tu s x ts u y ts u if i i y then s x tu i yi t s u i t s u i 0 k w which is only possible if s u i 0 hence s ex e y and the proof is complete 17 2 differential geometry based on retracts the crucial concept of this book is that of a sc smooth retraction which we are going to introduce next 2 1 retractions and retracts in this subsection we introduce several basic concepts definition 2 1 we consider a tuple u c e in which u is a relatively open subset of the partial quadrant c in the sc banach space e a sc smooth map r u u is called a sc smooth retraction on u if r r r as a side remark we observe that if u is an open subset of a banach space e and r u u is a c map in the classical sense satisfying r r r then the image of r is a smooth submanifold of the banach space e as the following propositions shows proposition 2 2 let r u u be a c retraction defined on an open subset u of a banach space e then o r u is a c submanifold of e more precisely for every point x o there exist an open neighborhood v of x and an open neighborhood w of 0 in e a splitting e r n and a smooth diffeomorphism v w satisfying 0 x and o v r w an elegant proof is due to henri cartan in 3 in sharp contrast to the conclusion of this proposition from classical dif ferential geometry there are sc retractions which have for example locally varying finite dimensions as we shall see later on definition 2 3 a tuple o c e is called a sc smooth retract if there exists a relatively open subset u of the partial quadrant c and a sc smooth retraction r u u satisfying r u o the first author would like to thank e ghys for pointing out this reference during his visit at ias in 2012 it seems that this is h cartan s last mathematical paper 18 in case x u 1 we deduce from r r r by the chain rule dr r x dr x dr x hence if x o 1 then r x x so that dr x dr x dr x and dr x e e is a projection proposition 2 4 let o c e be a sc smooth retract and assume that r u u and r u u are two sc smooth retractions defined on rel atively open subsets u and u of c and satisfying r u r u o then tr tu tr tu proof if y u then there exists y u so that r y r y conse quently r r y r r y r y r y and hence r r r similarly one sees that r r r if x h tr tu then x h tr y k for a pair y k tu moreover x o 1 u 1 so that x h tu from r r r it follows using the chain rule that tr x h tr tr y k t r r y k tr y k x h implying tr tu tr tu similarly one shows that tr tu tr tu and the proof of the proposition is complete proposition 2 4 allows us to define the tangent of a sc smooth retract o c e as follows definition 2 5 the tangent of the sc smooth retract o c e de noted by t o c e is defined as the triple t o c e to tc te in which tc c 1 e is the tangent of the partial quadrant c te e 1 e and to tr tu where r u u is any sc smooth retraction onto o we recall that explicitly to tr tu tr u 1 e r x dr x h x u 1 h e starting with a relatively open subset u of a partial quadrant c in e the tangent tc of c is a partial quadrant in te and tu is a relatively open subset of tc in the following we shall quite often just write o instead of o c e and to instead of to tc te however we would like to point out that the reference c e is important since it is possible that o is a sc smooth retract with respect to some nontrivial c but would not be a sc smooth retract for c e 19 proposition 2 6 let o c e and o c e be sc smooth retracts and let f o o be a map if r u u and s v v are sc smooth retractions onto o for the triple o c e then the following holds 1 if f r u e is sc smooth then f s v e is sc smooth and vice versa 2 if f r is sc smooth then t f r to t f s to 3 the tangent map t f r to maps to into to proof we assume that f r u e is sc since s v u v is sc the chain rule implies that the composition f r s v f is sc using the identity f r s f s we conclude that f s is sc interchanging the role of r and s the first part of the lemma is proved if x h to then x h ts x h and using the identity f r s f s and the chain rule we conclude t f r x h t f r ts x h t f r s x h t f s x h now we take any sc smooth retraction u u defined on a relatively open subset u of the the partial quadrant c in e satisfying u o then f f so that f r f r application of the chain rule yields the identity t f r x h t f r x h t t f r x h for all x h tr tu consequently t f r tr tu to to and this map is independent of the choice of a sc smooth retraction onto o in view of proposition 2 6 we can define the sc smoothness of a map between sc smooth retracts as follows definition 2 7 let f o o be a map between sc smooth retracts o c e and o c e and let r u u be a sc smooth retraction for o c e then the map f is sc smooth if the composition u e x 7 f r x is sc smooth in this case the tangent map tf to to is defined by tf t f r to 20 that the image of tf lies in to follows from r f r f r indeed differentiating and applying the definition of tf we deduce that tr tf tf which implies that the image of tf is in to proposition 2 6 shows that the definition does not depend on the choice of the sc smooth retraction r as long as it retracts onto o with definition 2 7 the chain rule for sc smooth maps between sc smooth retracts follows from theorem 1 21 theorem 2 8 let o c e o c e and o c e be two sc smooth retracts and let f o o and g o o be sc smooth then g f o o is sc smooth and t g f tg tf if f o o is a sc smooth map between sc smooth retracts as in defi nition 2 7 we abbreviate the linearization of f at the point o o 1 r u 1 on level 1 by tf o t f r o too so that tf o too tf o o is a continuous linear map between the tangent spaces too dr o e and tf o o dr f o e at this point we have defined a new category r whose objects are sc smooth retracts o c e and whose morphisms are sc smooth maps f o c e o c e between sc smooth retracts the map f is only defined between o and o but the other data o c e are needed to define the differential geometric properties of o we also have a well defined functor namely the tangent functor t r r it maps the object o c e into its tangent to tc te and the morphism f o c e o c e into its tangent map tf tf to tc te to tc te tf x h f x df x h for all x h to 21 the chain rule guarantees the functorial property t g f tg tf clearly this is enough to build a differential geometry whose local models are sc smooth retracts the details will be carried out in the next subsection let us note that t o c e has evidently more structure than o c e for example to o 1 seems to have some kind of bundle structure we shall discuss this briefly and introduce another category of retracts we consider tuples u c e where u is a relatively open subset of the partial quadrant c in the sc banach space e and let f be another sc banach space definition 2 9 let p u f u be a trivial sc bundle defined by the projection p u f u onto u and let r u f u f be a sc smooth map of the form r u v r u u v satisfying r r r and where u v is linear in v we call r a sc smooth bundle retraction covering the sc smooth retraction r and b r u f the associated sc smooth bundle retract and denote by p b o the induced projection onto o r u given two sc smooth bundle retractions p b o and p b o a sc smooth map b b of the form u v a u u v where u v is linear in v and p p is called a sc smooth local bundle map by br we denote the category whose objects are sc smooth bundle re tracts and whose morphisms are the sc smooth bundle maps there is a natural forgetful functor br r which on objects associates with the bundle b p o the total space b and which views a bundle map just as a sc smooth map if r u u is a sc smooth retraction then its tangent map tr tu tu is a sc smooth bundle retraction moreover the tangent map is a sc smooth bundle map consequently the tangent functor can be viewed as the functor t r br the functor t associates with the object o c e the triple to tc te in which we view te as the bundle te e 1 tc as the bundle tc c 1 and to as the bundle to o 1 with a sc smooth map f o c e o c e the functor t associates the sc smooth bundle map tf there is another class of retractions called strong bundle retractions which will be introduced in the later parts of section 2 2 22 2 2 m polyfolds and sub m polyfolds we start with the following observation about sc retractions proposition 2 10 let o c e be a sc smooth retract 1 if o is an open subset of o then o c e is a sc smooth retract 2 let v be an open subset of o and s v v a sc smooth map satisfying s s s if o s v then o c e is a sc smooth retract proof 1 by assumption there exists a sc smooth retraction r u u defined on a relatively open subset u of the partial quadrant c e whose image is o r u since the map r u u is continuous the set u r 1 o is an open subset of u and therefore a relatively open subset of c clearly o u and the restriction r r u defines a sc smooth retraction r u u onto r u o consequently the triple o c e is a sc smooth retract as claimed 2 the triple v c e is in view of 1 a sc smooth retract hence there exists a sc smooth retraction r u u onto r u v where u c e we define the map u u by s r then is sc smooth and s r s r if x u then r x v hence s r x v and consequently r s r x s r x so that r from s s s we conclude that hence is a sc smooth retraction onto the subset u s r u s v o we see that o c e is a sc smooth retract as claimed in the following every sc smooth map r o o defined on a sc smooth retract o and satisfying r r r will also be called a sc smooth retraction definition 2 11 let x be a topological space and x x a chart around x is a tuple v o c e in which v x is an open neighborhood of x in x and v o is a homeomorphism moreover o c e is a 23 sc smooth retract two charts v o c e and v o c e are called sc smoothly compatible if the transition maps 1 v v v v and 1 v v v v are sc smooth maps in the sense of definition 2 7 let us observe that v v is an open subset of o and so in view of part 1 of proposition 2 10 the tuple v v c e is a sc smooth retract so the above transition maps are defined on sc smooth retracts definition 2 12 a sc smooth atlas on the topological space x consists of a set of charts v o c e such that any two of them are sc smoothly compatible and the open sets v cover x two sc smooth atlases on x are said to be equivalent if their union is again a sc smooth atlas definition 2 13 a m polyfold x is a hausdorff paracompact topological space equipped with an equivalence class of sc smooth atlases analogous to the smoothness of maps between manifolds we shall define sc smoothness of maps between m polyfolds definition 2 14 a map f x y between two m polyfolds is called sc smooth if its coordinate representations are sc smooth in detail this requires the following if f x y and v o c e is a chart around x belonging to the atlas of x and v o c e is a chart around y belonging to the atlas of y so that f v v then the map f 1 o o is a sc smooth map between the sc smooth retracts in the sense of definition 2 7 the definition does not depend on the choice of sc smoothly compatible charts we recall that a hausdorff topological space is paracompact provided every open cover of x has an open locally finite refinement it is a well known fact that given an open cover u ui i i one can find a refinement 24 v vi i i satisfying vi ui for all i i some of the sets vi might be empty given a m polyfold x we say that a point x x is on the level m if there exists a chart v o c e around x such that x om of course this definition is independent of the choice of a chart around x we denote the collection of all points on the level m by xm the topology on xm is defined as follows we abbreviate by b the collection of all sets 1 w where w is an open subset of om o em in the chart v o c e on x then b is a basis for a topology on xm with this topology the set vm v xm is an open subset of xm and vm om is a homeomorphism so that the tuple vm om cm em is a chart on xm any two such charts are sc smoothly compatible and the collection of such charts is an atlas on xm in this way the m polyfold x inherits from the charts the filtration x x 0 x 1 x i 0 xi lemma 2 15 the inclusion map i xm 1 xm is continuous for all m 0 proof in view of the definition of topologies on xm and xm 1 it suffices to show that if v o c e is a chart on x and w is an open subset of om then 1 w xm 1 is open in xm 1 if x 1 w xm 1 then x w om 1 w em 1 since w is open in om there exists an open set w in em so that w w o hence x w em 1 o w o where w w em 1 is an open subset of em 1 hence w o is an open subset of om 1 and 1 w xm 1 1 w o proving our claim theorem 2 16 let x be a m polyfold for every m 0 the space xm is metrizable and in particular paracompact in addition the space x is metrizable the proof is postponed to appendix 2 6 2 in order to define the tangent tx of the m polyfold x we start with its local description in a chart definition 2 17 tangent space txo let o c e be a retract and t o c e to tc te its tangent so that p to o 1 is the tangent bundle over o the tangent space txo at a point x o 1 is the pre image p 1 x which is a banach space note that only in the case that x is a smooth point the tangent space txo has a natural sc structure 25 in the case that x o 1 the tangent space txo is the image of the projection dr x e e where r u u is any sc smooth retraction associated with o c e satisfying r u o next we consider tuples x v o c e h in which x x 1 is a point in the m polyfold x on level 1 and v o c e is a chart around the point x moreover h t x o two such tuples x v o c e h and x v o c e h are called equivalent if x x and t 1 x h h definition 2 18 the tangent space tx of x as a set is the collection of all equivalence classes x v o c e h if x x 1 is fixed the tangent space txx of the m polyfold x at the point x x is the subset of equivalence classes txx x v o c e h h t x o it has the structure of a vector space defined by x v o c e h 1 x v o c e h 2 x v o c e h 1 h 2 where r and h 1 h 2 t x o clearly tx x x 1 x txx 4 in order to define a topology on the tangent space tx we first fix a chart v o c e on x and associate with it a subset tv of tx defined as tv x v o c e h x v h t x o we introduce the tangent map t tv to by t x v o c e h x h where h t x o if x x 1 is fixed then the map t txv t x o 26 is a linear isomorphism therefore txx the tangent space at x x 1 inherits the banach space structure from t x o e e 0 if x x the tangent space txx is a sc banach space because the tangent space at the smooth point x o is a sc banach space if w is an an open subset of to we define the subset w tv by w t 1 w we denote by b the collection of all such sets w obtained by taking all the charts v o c e of the atlas and all open subsets w of the corresponding tangents to proposition 2 19 1 the collection b defines a basis for a hausdorff topology on tx 2 the projection p tx x 1 is a continuous and an open map 3 with the topology defined by b the tangent space tx of the m polyfold x is metrizable and hence in particular paracompact the proof is postponed to appendix 2 6 3 in view of our definition of the topology on tx the map t tv to associated with the chart v o c e is a homeomorphism moreover given two such maps t tv to and t tv to the composition t t 1 t tv tv t tv tv is explicitly of the form t t 1 a h 1 a d 1 a h t 1 a h 5 since the transition map 1 between sc retracts is sc smooth the com position in 5 is also sc smooth in addition to tc te is a sc smooth retract consequently the tuples tv t to tc te define a sc smooth atlas on tx since as we have proved above tx is paracompact the tan gent space tx of the m polyfold x is also a m polyfold the projection map p tx x 1 is locally built on the bundle retractions to o 1 and the transition maps of the charts are sc smooth bundle maps therefore p tx x 1 is a sc smooth m polyfold bundle 27 the m polyfold is the notion of a smooth manifold in our extended uni verse if x is a m polyfold which consists entirely of smooth points then it has a tangent space at every point there are finite dimensional examples for example the chap depicted in figure 1 has a m polyfold structure for which x x it illustrates in particular that m polyfolds allow to de scribe in a smooth way geometric objects having locally varying dimensions for details in the construction of the chap and further illustrations we refer to 25 section 1 in particular example 1 22 figure 1 this chap has a m polyfold structure for which every point is smooth next we introduce the notion of a sub m polyfold definition 2 20 let x be a m polyfold and let a be a subset of x the subset a is called a sub m polyfold of x if every a a possesses an open neighborhood v and a sc smooth retraction r v v such that r v a v proposition 2 21 a sub m polyfold a of a m polyfold x has in a natural way the structure of a m polyfold for which the following holds 1 the inclusion map i a x is sc smooth and a homeomorphism onto its image 28 2 for every a a and every sc smooth retraction r v v satisfying r v a v and a v the map i 1 r v a is sc smooth 3 the tangent space taa for a smooth a a has a sc complement in tax 4 if a is a smooth point and s w w is a sc smooth retraction sat isfying s w w a and a w then the induced map w a is sc smooth and ts a tax taa proof we first define a sc smooth atlas for a we choose a point a a and let v o c e be a chart of the m polyfold x around the point a by definition of a sub m polyfold there exists an open neighborhood u of a in x and a sc smooth retraction r u u satisfying r u u a the set w x defined by w r 1 u v u v is open in x and satisfies r w w and r w w a hence w is an open subset of o so that in view of of part 1 proposition 2 10 the tuple w c e is a sc retract we may therefore assume without loss of generality that u v w we define the sc smooth map o o by r 1 from r r r we deduce so that is a sc smooth retraction onto o o by the statement 2 in proposition 2 10 the triple o c e is a sc retract therefore there exists a relatively open subset u of the partial quadrant c in e and a sc smooth retraction r u u onto r u o restricting the map to w a we set w a and compute w a w a r w r 1 o o o consequently w a o is a homeomorphism and the triple w a o c e is a chart on a in order to consider the chart transformation we take a second compatible chart v o c e of the m polyfold x around the point a a and use it two construct the second chart w a o c e of a we shall show that the second chart is compatible with the already constructed chart w a o c e the domain w a w a of the transition map 1 w a w a w a w a 6 29 is an open subset of o so that in view of 2 of proposition 2 10 there exists a relatively open subset u c and a sc smooth retraction s u u onto s u w a w a by construction 1 s 1 s the chart transformation 1 o o is sc smooth so that by the chain rule the right hand side is sc smooth therefore also the left hand is a sc smooth map so in view of definition 2 7 of a sc smooth map between retracts the transition map 1 is sc smooth we have shown that the collection of charts w a w a c e defines a sc smooth atlas for a the sc smooth structure on a is defined by its equivalence class in order to prove the statement 2 in proposition 2 21 we use the above local coordinates assuming as above that u v w the inclusion map i a x is in the local coordinates the inclusion j o r u o which is a sc smooth map since r u u is a sc retraction conversely the relations r 1 o o and u 1 o show that the map i 1 r u a is sc smooth because the retraction r u u is by assumption sc smooth this proves statement 2 of the proposition in order to prove the statement 3 we work in local coordinates and assume that x is given by the triple o c e in which o r u and r u u is a retraction of the relatively open subset u of c in e then a is a subset of o having the property that every point a a possesses an open neighborhood v in o and a sc smooth retraction s v v onto s v a v we now assume that a a is a smooth point and introduce the map t s r u u then t t t and t is a sc smooth retraction onto the set v a hence the tangent space taa is defined by taa dt a e ds a dr a e ds a tao from r t r s r s r t we conclude dr a dt a e dt a e and hence dt a e tao therefore tao dr a e ds a dr a i ds a dr a e taa i ds a tao this proves the statement 3 using the same arguments the statement 4 follows and the proof of proposition 2 21 is complete 30 2 3 degeneracy index and boundary geometry on the m polyfold x we shall introduce the map dx x n 0 called degen eracy index as follows we first take a smooth chart v o c e around the point x and define the integer d x v o c e dc x where dc is the index defined in section 1 3 in other words we record how many vanishing coordinates the image point x has in the partial quadrant c definition 2 22 the degeneracy dx x at the point x x is the mini mum of all numbers d x v o c e where v o c e varies over all smooth charts around the point x the degeneracy index of the m polyfold x is the map dx x n 0 the next lemma is evident lemma 2 23 every point x x possesses an open neighborhood u x such that dx y dx x for all y u x from the definitions one deduces immediately the following result proposition 2 24 if x and y are m polyfolds and if f u x v f x is a germ of sc diffeomorphisms around the points x x and f x y then dx x dy f x the index dx quantifies to which extend a point x has to be seen as a boundary point a more degenerate point has a higher index definition 2 25 the subset x x x dx x 1 of x is called the boundary of x a m polyfold x for which dx 0 is called a m polyfold without boundary the relationship between da and dx where a is a sub m polyfold of x is described in the following lemma lemma 2 26 if x is a m polyfold and a x a sub m polyfold of x then da a dx a for all a a 31 proof we take a point a a and choose a chart v o c e around the point a belonging to the atlas for x and satisfying dx a d a v o c e the integer on the right hand side remains unchanged if we take a smaller domain still containing a and replace o by its image then arguing as in proposition 2 21 we may assume that the corresponding chart of the atlas for a is v o c e where we have abbreviated v v a v and o v then d a v o c e d a v o c e dx a and hence taking the minimum on the left hand side da a dx a as claimed in the lemma if e rk w is the sc banach space and c 0 k w the partial quadrant in e we define the linear subspace ei of e by ei a 1 ak w rk w ai 0 with a subset i 1 k we associate the subspace ei i i ei in particular e e e i ei and e 1 k 0 k w w if x c we denote by i x the set of indices i 1 k for which x ei we abbreviate ex ei x associated with ei we have the closed half space hi consisting of all elements a w in rk w satisfying ai 0 hi a 1 ak w e ai 0 if x c we define the partial cone cx in e as cx ci x i i x hi 32 as an illustration we take the standard quadrant c r 2 consisting of all x y with x y 0 then c 0 0 c c 1 0 x y y 0 c 0 1 x y x 0 and c 1 1 r 2 if z x y is at least on level 1 one should view cz as a partial quadrant in the tangent space tzc e we shall put some additional structure on a sc smooth retract o c e which turns out to be useful we call a subset c of a banach space or sc banach space a cone pro vided it is closed convex and satisfies r c c and c c 0 if all properties except the last one hold we call c a partial cone definition 2 27 let o c e be a sc smooth retract and let x o be a smooth point in o the partial cone cxo at x is defined as the following subset of the tangent space at x cxo txo cx where cx i i x hi the reduced tangent space t r x o is defined as the following subset of the tangent space at x trx o txo ex remark 2 28 we have the inclusions trx o cxo txo and naively one might expect that cxo is a partial quadrant in txo how ever this is in general not the case the reduced tangent space and the partial cone are characterized in the next lemma lemma 2 29 let o c e be a sc smooth retract and let x o be a smooth point in o then the following holds 1 trx o cl 0 o is sc smooth and 0 x 2 cxo cl 0 0 o is sc smooth and 0 x 3 txo cxo cxo here 0 d dt t t 0 stands for the derivative of the sc smooth path in the parameter t varying in resp in 0 33 proof we may assume that o is a sc smooth retract in the partial quadrant c 0 k w e rk w and that o r u where r u u is a sc smooth retraction on the relatively open subset u of c let us denote for x rk w by x 1 xk its coordinates in rk 1 in order to prove 1 we first introduce the set 0 o is sc smooth and 0 x 7 and observe that is contained in o and 0 e since the closure of trx o is equal to t r x o it is enough to prove that t r x o and trx o as for the first inclusion we take v trx o hence x tv u for t small this follows from the fact that for i i x we have ai vi 0 and for i 6 i x we have xi 0 since x and v are smooth points x tv u then t r x tv is defined for t small takes values in o and 0 x by the chain rule 0 dr x v v since v txo image of dr x hence v and trx o as claimed conversely if o is a sc smooth path satisfying 0 x then r t t so that applying the chain rule we find dr x 0 0 this shows that 0 is a smooth point belonging to txo if i i x then i 0 xi 0 and since i t 0 for all t we conclude that i 0 0 so that 0 ex hence 0 txo ex trx o and since 0 is a smooth point 0 trx o therefore trx o and the proof of 1 is complete 2 the proof of 2 is along the same line except that considering a sc smooth path 0 o we conclude that dr x 0 cx and since dr x 0 0 we find that cxo is a subset of the right hand side of 2 conversely we take a smooth point v cxo and consider the path t r x tv defined for t 0 small then 0 dr x v belongs to the right hand side of 2 and since cxo is closed the result follows 3 clearly cxo cxo txo conversely let h txo then h dr x k where k a w e if i i x we set a i ai ai 2 34 then a i 0 and ai a i a i now we define elements k e as follows first k b w where bi ai if i 6 i x and bi a i if i i x the element k is defined as k c 0 where ci 0 if i 6 i x and ci a i if i i x then k k k and if h dr x k then by 2 we have h cxo and h h h cxo cxo the proof of 3 and hence the proof of lemma 2 29 is complete from the characterization of txo and cxo in lemma 2 29 we deduce immediately the next proposition proposition 2 30 let o c e and o c e be sc smooth retracts and let x o if f o x o f x is a germ of a sc diffeomorphism mapping x o onto f x y o then tf x trx o t r y o and tf x cxo cyo a sc smooth retract o associated with a triple o c e is a m polyfold and recalling definition 2 22 its degeneracy index do x at the point x is the integer do x min dc x where the minimum is taken over all germs of sc diffeomorphisms o x o x into sc smooth retracts o associated with o c e the integer dc x is introduced in section 1 3 theorem 2 31 let o c e be a smooth retract and let do be the degen eracy index of o if x o is a smooth point we have the inequality dim txo t r x o do x moreover if dim txo t r x o do x then cxo is a partial quadrant in txo proof let x be a smooth point of the retract o by proposition 2 30 the di mension of txo t r x o is preserved under germs of sc diffeomorphisms hence in view of the definition of do x we may assume without loss of generality that do x dc x d moreover without loss of generality we may assume that e rk w c 0 k w and x 0 0 xd 1 xk w where xi 0 for d 1 i k 35 and w w we recall that if v a b w trx o rd rk d w then a 0 and if v a b w cxo then ai 0 for 1 i d in order to prove the first statement we choose smooth vectors v 1 vl in txo such that v j trx o 1 j l are linearly independent in the vector space txo t r x o representing v j aj bj wj rd rk d w we claim that the vectors aj 1 j l are linearly independent in rd indeed assuming that l j 1 ja j 0 we have l j 1 jv j 0 l j 1 jb j l j 1 jw j trx o hence l j 1 j vj trx o l j 1 jv j trx o t r x o since vj trx o 1 j l are linearly independent in txo t r x o we conclude that 1 l 0 proving our claim this implies that the vectors a 1 al are linearly independent in rd therefore l d and hence dim txo trx o d do x proving the first statement of the theorem in order to prove the second statement we assume that dim txo t r x o do x if now v j trx o 1 j d is a basis of txo t r x o then representing vj aj bj wj txo rd rk d w and arguing as above the vectors aj for 1 j d form a basis of rd consequently the map txo trx o rd defined by v trx o a b w t r x o a is a linear isomorphism moreover if v a b w cxo so that aj 0 for 1 j d then v trx o a b w t r x o 0 d denoting by ej for 1 j d the standard basis of rd we introduce 1 ej v j trx o by definition the vectors v j are of the form v j ej b j w j and are linearly independent in rd rk d w if now v a b w txo we have the decomposition v a b w d j 1 aj v j v d j 1 aj v j 36 where a a 1 ad rd since the second term on the right hand side belongs to trx o we have the following decompositions of the tangent space txo and of cxo txo rv 1 rv d trx o and cxo r v 1 r v d trx o therefore the map t txo rd txo defined by t 1 v 1 dv d w 1 d w is a sc linear isomorphism satisfying t cxo 0 d trx o hence cxo is a partial quadrant in txo and the second statement of theorem 2 31 is proved the partial quadrant c in e is the image of the sc smooth retraction r 1 c c c in particular c is a m polyfold which we denote by xc in section 1 3 we have defined the map dc c n 0 which associates with a point x c its number of vanishing coordinates above we have defined the degeneracy index dxc xc n 0 of the m polyfold xc by definition dxc dc and we shall prove that dxc dc we may assume without loss of generality that c 0 k w and e rk w for a smooth point x c we have txc e and trx c ex implying dim txc trx c dc x this of course also holds for any partial quadrant c e hence dc x dim txxc t r x xc for a smooth point x c from this we deduce the following corollary of theorem 2 31 corollary 2 32 let c be a partial quadrant in a sc banach space consid ering c as a m polyfold denoted by xc we have the equality dc dxc proof let us first take a smooth point x c in view of theorem 2 31 dim txxc t r x xc dxc x since dc x dim txxc t r x xc as we have just seen it follows that dc x dxc x by definition of dxc x we always have the inequality dxc x dc x consequently dxc x dc x if x c 37 if x c is arbitrary we take a sequence of smooth points xk c converging to x and satisfying dc xk dc x hence dc x dc xk dxc xk in view of the definition of dxc we find a sc diffeomorphism f u x o where u x c is relatively open and o c e is a sc smooth retract so that dxc x dc f x then f xk f x and trivially dc f xk dc f x for large k hence for large k dc x dc xk dxc xk dxc f xk dc f xk dc f x dxc x since dxc x dc x we conclude dxc x dc x and the proof of corol lary 2 32 is complete from now on we do not have to distinguish between the index dc defined for partial quadrants and the degeneracy index dxc where we view c as a m polyfold 2 4 tame m polyfolds in order to define spaces whose boundaries have more structure we introduce the notion of a tame m polyfold and of tame retractions and tame retracts we start with some basic geometry let c e be a partial quadrant in a sc banach space e we begin with the particular case e rk w and c 0 k w we recall the linear sc subspace ei of codimension 1 defined as ei a 1 ak w rk w ai 0 8 associated with ei there is the closed half space hi consisting of all elements a w in rk w satisfying ai 0 hi a 1 ak w e ai 0 9 in the general case of a partial quadrant c in e we can describe the above definitions in a more intrinsic way as follows 38 we consider the set e c dc e 1 of boundary points this set has exactly k connected components which we denote by a 1 ak each component ai lies in the smallest subspace fi of e containing ai we call fi an extended face and denote by f the set of all extended faces the set f contains exactly k extended faces given an extended face f f we denote by hf the closed half subspace of e which contains c in the special case c 0 k w rk w the extended faces fi are the subspaces ei and the half spaces hfi are the half subspaces hi if e c we introduce the set of all extended faces containing e by f e f f e f clearly dc e f e definition 2 33 the partial quadrant ce associated with e c is defined as ce f f e hf the minimal linear subspace associated with e c is defined by ee f f e f clearly the following inclusions hold ee ce e for an interior point x c i e a point satisfying dc x 0 we set ee ce e the codimension of ee in e is precisely dc e the maximal value dce attains is dc e next we introduce a special class of sc smooth retracts definition 2 34 tame sc retraction let r u u be a sc smooth retraction defined on a relatively open subset u of a partial quadrant c in the sc banach space e the sc smooth retraction r is called a tame sc retraction if the following two conditions are satisfied 1 dc r x dc x for all x in u 39 2 at every smooth point x in o r u there exists a sc subspace a e such that e txo a and a ex a sc smooth retract o c e is called a tame sc smooth retract if o is the image of a sc smooth tame retraction let x be a smooth point in the tame sc retract o and let a ex be a sc complement of the tangent space txo as guaranteed by condition 2 in definition 2 34 so that e txo a 10 we recall that txo dr x e and hence e dr x e 1 dr x e txo 1 dr x e 11 applying the projection 1 dr x to the equation 10 and using that 1 dr x txo 0 we obtain 1 dr x e 1 dr x a 12 we claim that 1 dr x e ex in order to prove this claim we recall that a ex so that in view of 12 it is sufficient to prove that dr x ex ex we may assume that e rk w and x 0 0 xd 1 xk w with xd 1 xk 0 we choose a smooth point y ex so that y 0 0 yd 1 yk v if is small then x x y belongs to the partial quadrant c and has the first d coordinates vanishing by condition 1 in definition 2 34 of a tame sc retraction r we have dc r x y dc x y hence the first d coordinates of r x y vanish and from d d r x y 0 dr x y we conclude that the first d coordinates of dr x y vanish the same is true if y is on level 0 in ex so dr x ex ex and hence in view of 12 we have verified that 1 dr x e ex as claimed in view of 11 we can therefore always assume without loss of generality that in condition 2 of definition 2 34 the complement a of txo is equal to a 1 dr x e summarizing the discussion we have established the following proposition 40 proposition 2 35 let u c e be a relatively open subset of a par tial quadrant in a sc banach space and let r u u be a sc smooth tame retraction then for every smooth point x o r u the sc subspace 1 dr x e is a subspace of ex so that in condition 2 of definition 2 34 we can take a 1 dr x e let us discuss the tame sc smooth retracts in more detail proposition 2 36 let o c e be a tame sc smooth retract and let x o be a smooth point of o then trx o is a banach space of codimension do x in txo so that dim txo t r x o do x 13 in particular cxo is a partial quadrant in the the tangent space txo in addition for every point x o we have the equality do x dc x 14 proof we assume that o r u is the retract in u c e of the tame sc retraction r u u moreover we may assume that c 0 k w e rk w then the condition 2 of definition 2 34 says that for every x o there exists a sc subspace a of e satisfying e im dr x a txo a and a ex where ex ei x therefore ex txo a ex txo ex a ex trx o a 15 since a ex the space ex has codimension dc x in e so that dc x dim e ex dim txo a trx o a dim txo t r x o 16 employing theorem 2 31 we conclude from 16 that dc x do x for all x o by definition do x dc x for all x o and hence dc x do x if x o 17 consequently dimtxo t r x o do x employing theorem 2 31 once more cxo is a partial quadrant in the tangent space txo it remains to prove that do x dc x for all not necessarily smooth points x o if x a w o we take a sequence wj w converging 41 to w in w then the sequence xj o defined by xj r a wj consists of smooth points and converges to x in e since by assumption the retraction r is tame dc xj dc r a wj dc a wj dc a w dc x and using 17 we conclude that do xj dc xj dc x by definition of do we find an open neighborhood v o around x such that do y do x for all y v consequently for large j do x lim j do xj dc x in view of do x dc x we conclude do x dc x and the proof of proposition 2 36 is complete among all m polyfolds there is a distinguished class of m polyfolds which are modeled on tame retracts these turn out to have an interesting and useful boundary geometry definition 2 37 a tame m polyfoldx is a m polyfold which possesses an equivalent sc smooth atlas whose charts are all modeled on tame sc smooth retracts by proposition 2 30 the following concepts for any m polyfold are well defined and independent of the choice of the charts definition 2 38 let x be a m polyfold for a smooth point x x the reduced tangent space trx x is by definition the sc subspace of the tangent space txx which by definition is the preimage of t r o o under any chart v x o o so that t x trx x t r o o too eo for a smooth point x x the partial cone cxx is the closed convex subset of txx which under a sc smooth chart as above is mapped onto coo i e t x cxx too co from proposition 2 36 we conclude if the m polyfold x is tame and if x x is a smooth point that cxx is a partial quadrant in the tangent space txo and we have the identity dx x dim txx t r x x dcxx 0 x 42 where 0 x is the zero vector in txx we are going to show that the boundary of a tame m polyfold has an additional structure definition 2 39 let x be a tame m polyfold a face f of x is the closure of a connected component in the subset x x d x 1 the m polyfold x is called face structured if every point x x lies in exactly dx x many faces before we study faces in more detail we have a look at the local situation lemma 2 40 let o c e be a sc smooth tame retract and let f be the collection of extended faces associated with the partial quadrant c then the faces f in o are the connected components of the sets f o where f f are extended faces the connected components of f o and f o containing a point x o are equal if and only if f f proof by definition of o the retract o itself is a tame m polyfold we denote by u c e the relatively open subset in the partial quadrant c on which a tame sc smooth retraction satisfies r u o let f be a connected component of the subset x o do x 1 by proposition 2 36 do dc so that this set is the same as a connected component of x o dc x 1 if we look at the isomorphic case e rk w we see immediately that there exists an index i such that f must lie in the subset of c consisting of points a w for which ai 0 we conclude that there exists an extended face f f such that f f therefore f is contained in a connected subset of o f next we consider a connected component q of o f where f is an extended face of c let e q by assumption e f and we can take a vector h f so small that e th u f for t 0 1 and such that for t 0 1 the points e th do not belong to any extended face other than f this can be constructed explicitly using the model e rk w for e since the retraction r is tame we have dc r e th 1 for t 0 1 and for t 0 1 the points r e th belong to the same connected component of x o do x 1 using this argument repeatedly we can connect any two points in q by a continuous path 0 1 q such that the points y 0 1 satisfy dc y 1 this implies that q is contained in the closure of the connected component f in x x do x 1 43 corollary 2 41 if o c e is a tame sc smooth retract then every point x o lies in precisely do x many faces proof in view of proposition 2 36 do x dc x so that x belongs to precisely d dc x extended faces f f x let us say it belongs to the faces f 1 fd in the sc banach space e rk w defined as the subspaces fi a 1 ak w ai 0 1 i d the point x is represented by x 0 0 ad 1 ak w where aj 6 0 for d 1 j k let r u u be the tame retraction onto o r u then the paths i t in o for 1 i d starting at i 0 x are defined by i t r t t ai 0 t t ad 1 ak w because the retraction r is tame we have dc i t 1 if t 0 and the points i t belong to fi o but not to any other face fj o with j 6 i hence the connected components containing x of the sets o fj for 1 j d are all different this proves the last assertion corollary 2 41 implies immediately the following result proposition 2 42 if x is a tame m polyfold then every point x x has an open neighborhood v so that y v lies in precisely dx y many faces of v and dv y dx y for all y v in particular globally a point x x lies in at most dx x many faces the following technical result turns out to be useful later on proposition 2 43 properties of faces let o c e be a tame sc smooth retract associated with the tame sc smooth retraction r u u onto o r u and let f be a face of o then there exists an open neighborhood v of f in u and a sc smooth retraction s v v onto s v f moreover defining v o by v o v the restriction s v v is a sc smooth retraction onto s v f so that f is a sc smooth sub m polyfold of o further f is tame i e it admits a compatible sc smooth atlas consisting of tame local models in addition df x do x 1 for all x f proof we may assume that e rk w and c 0 k w let u c be a relatively open subset of the partial quadrant c and let r u u be a tame 44 sc smooth retraction onto r u o in view of lemma 2 40 we may assume that our face f is a connected component of o f 1 where f 1 is the extended face consisting of those points whose first coordinate vanishes consequently for every a w f we find an open neighborhood u a w u in c such that if b v u a w then r 0 b 2 bk v has the first coordinate vanishing taking the union of these neighborhoods we find an open neighborhood u of f which is contained in u such that for every b v u the point 0 b 2 bk v belongs to u and r 0 b 2 bk v has the first coordinate vanishing and belongs to f hence we can define the sc smooth map s u u by s b v r 0 b 2 bk v which has its image in f so that in view of f u we may assume that s u u it follows that the face f is a sc smooth sub m polyfold of o we know that f is a connected component of f 1 o we find an open neighborhood v of o in f 1 c f 1 so that r v f clearly s r v v v preserves dc f 1 since it preserves dc and dc dc f 1 1 on c f 1 if x f is a smooth point then txf txo is of codimension 1 and hence has a complement p of dimension 1 so that txo txf p we know from definition 2 34 of a tame retract that txo has a sc complement a ex in e hence e txo a txf p a in view of p f 1 0 and txf f 1 txf we deduce f 1 e f 1 txf p a f 1 txf f 1 a noting that f 1 a f 1 ex f 1 the sc smooth retraction s v v onto s v f is tame since the last statement of proposition 2 43 is obvious the proof of proposition 2 43 is complete 45 in order to formulate another result along the same lines we first recall that given any point x in a tame m polyfold x we find an open neighbor hood u u x such that u x has precisely dx x many faces containing x since we can choose u as small was we wish it makes sense to introduce the notion of a face germ two local faces f and f at x have the same germ if there exists an open neighborhood u u x such that u f u f we shall write f x for a face germ sometimes we shall call them codimen sion one face germs if we refer to a face germ we always mean the latter the collection of all codimension one face germs at x is denoted by fx for a subset fx we denote by f x the intersection f x f x f and call it codimension face germ proposition 2 44 given a tame m polyfold x every point x has dx x many local faces containing x the local faces are tame m polyfolds with df x dx x 1 the intersection of local faces f associated to a subset of fx is a tame m polyfold of codimension and df x dx x we sum up the discussion about faces in the following theorem theorem 2 45 the interior of a face f in a tame m polyfold x is a sc smooth sub m polyfold of x if x is face structured then every face f is a sub m polyfold and the induced m polyfold structure is tame the inclusion map i f x satisfies dx i x df x 1 every point x x has an open neighborhood u such that every point y u lies in precisely dx y many faces of u if x is face structured then every point x x lies in precisely dx x many global faces of x later on we shall frequently use the following proposition about degen eracy index in fibered products proposition 2 46 let f x z be a local sc diffeomorphism and g y z a sc smooth map then the fibered product xf gy defined by xf gy x y x y f x g y is a sub m polyfold of x y if y is tame then also xf gy is tame and dxf gy x y dy y 46 if both x and y are tame and both f and g are local sc diffeomorphism then dxf gy x y 1 2 dx y x y 1 2 dx x dy y dx x dy y proof clearly the product x y is an m polyfold and if both x and y are tame then also x y is tame to see that xf gy is a sub m polyfold of x y we take a point x y xf gy and fix open neighborhoods u of x in x and w of f x in z so that f u u w is a sc diffeomorphism next we choose an open neighborhood v of y in z such that g v w we define the map r u v u v by r x y f u 1 g y y it is sc smooth and satisfies r r r and r u v u v xf gy consequently xf gy is a sub m polyfold of x y next we assume in addition that y is tame with the point x y xf gy and open sets u and v as above we assume that v o c e is a chart around x such that o c e is a tame sc smooth retract then we define a map u v xf gy o by setting x y y the map is injective since given a pair x y xf gy we have x f u 1 g y and hence is homeomorphism onto o so the tuple u v xf gy o c e is a chart on xf gy and any two such charts are sc smooth compatible consequently xf gy is tame to prove the formula for the degeneracy index we consider the projection 2 xf gy x x y y onto the second component in view of the above discussion 2 is a local sc diffeomorphism and consequently preserves the degeneracy index hence dxf gy x y dy y if both f and g are sc diffeomorphisms and x and y are both tame then it follows from the previous case that dxf gy x y dx x so that dxf gy x y dx x dy y finally since x y is tame then dx y x y dx x dy y so that dx y x y dx x dy y 2 dx x 2 dy y 2 dxf gy x y for every x y xf gy the proof of proposition 2 46 is complete 47 2 5 strong bundles as a preparation for the study of sc fredholm sections in the next chapter we shall introduce in this section the notion of a strong bundle over a m polyfold as usual we shall first describe the new notion in local charts of a strong bundle and consider u c e where u is a relatively open subset of the partial quadrant c in the sc banach space e if f is another sc banach space we define the non symmetric product u f as follows as a set u f is the product u f but it possesses a double filtration m k for 0 k m 1 defined by u f m k um fk we view u f u as a trivial bundle we define for i 0 1 the sc manifolds u f i by their filtrations u f i m um fm i m 0 definition 2 47 a strong bundle map u f u f is a map which preserves the double filtration and is of the form u h u u h where the map is linear in h in addition for i 0 1 the maps u f i u f i are sc smooth a strong bundle isomorphism is an invertible strong bundle map whose inverse is also a strong bundle map a strong bundle retraction is a strong bundle map r u f u f 48 satisfying in addition r r r the map r has the form r u h r u u h where r u u is a sc smooth retraction a tame strong bundle re traction is one for which the retraction r is tame the condition r r r of the retraction r requires that r r u r u u h r u u h hence if r u u then u u h u h and the bounded linear operator h 7 u h f f is a projection if r u u is in addition a smooth point then the projection is a sc operator we continue to denote by u c e a relatively open subset of the partial quadrant c in the sc banach space e and let f be another sc banach space definition 2 48 a local strong bundle retract denoted by k c f e f consists of a subset k c f which is the image k r u f of a strong bundle retraction r u f u f of the form r u h r u u h here r u u is a sc smooth retrac tion onto r u o the local strong bundle retract k c f e f will sometimes be ab breviated by p k o where p is the map induced by the projection onto the first factor if the strong bundle retraction r is tame the local strong bundle retract is called a tame local strong bundle retract 49 the retract k inherits the double filtration km k for m 0 and 0 k m 1 defined by km k k um fk u h um fk r u h u h u h om fk u h h the associated spaces k i defined by k i k 0 i i 0 1 are equipped with the filtrations k i m km m i for all m 0 the projection maps p k i o are sc smooth for i 0 1 they are in fact sc smooth bundle maps as introduced earlier definition 2 49 a section of the local strong bundle retract p k o is a map f o k satisfying p f 1 o the section f is called sc smooth if f is a section of the bundle p k 0 o the section f is called sc smooth if f is a sc smooth section of the bundle p k 1 o a section f o k is of the form f x x f x o f and the map f o f is called principal part of the section we shall usually denote the principal part with the same letter as the section at this point we can introduce the category sbr its objects are the local strong bundle retractions k c f e f the morphisms of the category are maps k k between local strong bundle retracts which are linear in the fibers and preserve the double filtrations moreover the induced maps i k i k i are sc smooth for i 0 1 50 we recall that by definition the map i k i k i between retracts is sc smooth if the composition with the retraction r u f i e f i is sc smooth there are two forget functors forget i sbr br into the category of br of sc smooth bundle retractions introduced in section 2 1 they are defined by forget i k k i on the objects k of the category and forget i i on the morphisms between the objects we are in a position to introduce the notion of a strong bundle over a m polyfold x we consider a continuous surjective map p y x from the paracompact hausdorff space y onto the m polyfold x we assume for every x x that the fiber p 1 x yx has the structure of a banachable space definition 2 50 a strong bundle chart for the bundle p y x is a tuple p 1 v k u f in which u c e is an open subset of the partial quadrant c in the sc banach space e and f is a sc banach space moreover k r u f is the image of a strong bundle retraction r u f u f of the form r u h r u u h where r u u is a sc smooth retraction onto the retract o r u of o c e and is linear in h in addition v x is an open subset of x homeomorphic to the retract o by a homeomorphism v o in addition p 1 v k 51 is a homeomorphism from p 1 v y onto the retract k covering the homeomorphism v o so that the diagram p 1 v k p y yp v o commutes the map has the property that in the fibers over x v the map p 1 x p 1 x is a bounded linear operator between banach spaces two strong bundle charts p 1 v k and p 1 v k satisfying v v 6 are compatible if the transition maps 1 i p 1 v v i p 1 v v i are sc smooth diffeomorphisms for i 0 1 as usual one now proceeds to define a strong bundle atlas consisting of compatible strong bundle charts covering y and the equivalence between two such atlases definition 2 51 the continuous surjection p y x from the paracompact hausdorff space y onto the m polyfold x equipped with an equivalence class of strong bundle atlases is called a strong bundle over the m polyfold x induced by the strong bundle charts the m polyfold y is equipped with a natural double filtration into subsets ym k m 0 and 0 k m 1 therefore we can distinguish the underlying m polyfolds y i for i 0 1 with the filtrations y i m ym m i m 0 the projections p i y i x are sc smooth maps between m polyfolds correspondingly we distinguish two types of sections of the strong bundle p y x 52 definition 2 52 a section of the strong bundle p y x is a map f x y satisfying p f 1 x the section f is called a sc smooth section if f is an sc smooth section of the bundle p 0 y 0 x the section f is called a sc section of p y x if f is an sc smooth section of the bundle p 1 y 1 x if we say f is an sc section of p y x we mean that it is an sc smooth section of y 0 x an sc section or sc smooth section of p y x is an sc smooth section of y 1 x definition 2 53 pull back bundle let p y x be a strong bundle over the m polyfold x and let f z x be an sc smooth map from the m polyfold z into x the pull back bundle of f pf f y z is defined by the set f y z y z y p y f z and the projection pf z y z so that with the projection p f y y defined by p z y y the diagram f y p y pf y yp z f x commutes as already shown in 20 proposition 4 11 the strong m polyfold struc ture p induces a natural strong m polyfold structure of the pull back bundle pf proposition 2 54 the pull back bundle pf f y z carries a natural structure of a strong m polyfold bundle over the m polyfold z the easy proof is left to the reader 53 2 6 appendix 2 6 1 proof of proposition 2 2 proof of proposition 2 2 the c retraction r satisfies r r r and hence by the chain rule dr r x dr x dr x for every x u therefore if r x x then dr x dr x dr x 18 and hence the linear operator dr x l e e is a projection at every point x o now we take a point x o r u and for simplicity assume that x 0 in view of 18 the banach space e splits into e r n where r range dr 0 ker 1 dr 0 n ker dr 0 range 1 dr 0 according to the splitting e r n we use the equivalent norm a b max a b by b we denote an open ball of radius with respect to the norm centered at the origin now we introduce the map f r n u e defined by f a b r a 1 dr a b at a b 0 0 we have f 0 0 r 0 0 and df 0 0 h k h k for all h k r n consequently in view of the inverse function theorem f is a local c diffeomorphism and we assume without loss of generality that f is a diffeomorphism on u we claim that there exist positive numbers such that if f a b o r u for a b b then b 0 the proposition then follows by setting w b v f w and defining the map w v by f v 1 it remains to prove the claim that b 0 since r is smooth we find a constant 0 such that b 2 u and dr x dr 0 1 3 for all x 19 54 moreover since r 0 0 there exists a constant 0 3 4 such that r x for all x 20 if x b then for h r r x h r r x dr r x h o h r x dr r x h o h 21 where o h is an e valued map satisfying o h h 0 as h 0 taking a smaller we may assume that o h h 2 for all h 22 let x a b b and f a b o this means that r r a 1 dr a b r a 1 dr a b 23 by 19 and the fact that dr 0 b 0 for b n the norm of 1 dr a b for a can be estimated as b dr a b b dr a dr 0 b 4 3 b 24 inserting x a and h 1 dr a b into 21 and using the identity 23 we obtain dr r a h h o h 25 the left hand side is equal to dr r a h dr r a b dr r a dr a b dr r a b dr a b and the right hand side is equal to h o h b dr a b o h so that 25 takes the form dr r a b b o h 26 arguing by contradiction we assume that b 6 0 since r a the norm of the left hand side is in view of 19 bounded from above by dr r a b dr r a b dr 0 b 1 3 b 27 on the other hand using 22 and 24 we estimate the norm of the right hand side of 26 from below as b o h b 1 2 h b 2 3 b 1 3 b 28 consequently 1 3 b 1 3 b which is absurd therefore b 0 and the proof is complete 55 2 6 2 proof of theorem 2 16 we make use of the following theorem of metrizability due to yu m smirnov 39 theorem 2 55 yu m smirnov let x be a space that is paracompact hausdorff and assume that every point has an open neighborhood in x that is metrizable then x is metrizable the following result is an equivalent definition of paracompactness lemma 2 56 34 lemma 1 a regular hausdorff space x is paracompact if and only if every open cover of x has a locally finite refinement consisting of closed sets we shall use the above lemma in the proof of the following result proposition 2 57 let y be a regular topological space and let yi i i be a locally finite family of closed subspaces of y so that y i i yi if every subspace yi is paracompact then y is paracompact proof given an open cover u uj j j of y it is in view of lemma 2 56 enough to show that there exists a closed locally finite refinement c cj j j of u in order to prove this we consider for every i the cover yi yi uj j j of yi consisting of open sets in yi since yi is paracompact lemma 2 56 implies that there exists a closed locally finite refinement cij j j of yi the sets c i j are closed in y and by definition of refinement satisfy cij yi uj and j j cij yi 29 now for every j j we define the set cj i i cij and claim that the family c cj j j is a closed locally finite refinement of u we start with showing that cj is closed let x x cj i i x c i j since yi i i is locally finite we find an open neighborhood v x of x in y which intersects yi for at most finitely many indices i say for i belonging to the finite subset i i if i 6 i then by 29 v x y yi y cij 56 so that v x i 6 i y yi then the set u x v x l i y c i j is an open neighborhood of x in y contained in y cj this shows that cj is closed as claimed that c is a cover of x and a refinement of u follows from 29 j j cj j j i i cij i i j j cij i i yi x and vj i i cij i i yi uj uj it remains to show that c is locally finite local finiteness of yi i i implies that a given point x y belongs to finitely many yi s say x yi if and only if i belongs to the finite subset i i moreover there exists an open neighborhood v x of x in y intersecting at most finitely many yi s since y is regular we can replace v x by a smaller open set intersecting only those yi s whose indices i belong to i also cij j j is a locally finite family in yi so that there exists an open neighborhood vi x of x in yi intersecting c i j for at most finitely many indices j which belong to the finite subset ji j each vi x is of the form vi x ui x yi for some open neighborhood ui x of x in y then u x v x i i ui x is an open neighborhood of x in y intersecting yi only for i i and the set u x yi intersects cij only for j ji this implies that u x can have a nonempty intersection with cj only for j i i ji hence the family c cj j j is locally finite and the proof is complete now we are ready to prove the theorem proof of theorem 2 16 we start with m 0 and take an atlas u j j oj cj ej j j since j u j oj is a homeomorphism and oj is a metric space u j is metrizable hence x is locally metrizable since by assumption x is haus dorff and paracompact the smirnov metrizability theorem implies that x is metrizable 57 in order to prove that xm is metrizable for m 1 we fix m 1 and consider the topological space xm since by assumption x is hausdorff given two distinct points x and x in xm there exist two disjoint open neigh borhoods u and u of x and x in x hence the sets um and u m are disjoint open neighborhoods of x and x in xm so that also xm is a hausdorff space moreover the maps um ojm are homeomorphisms and since ojm is a metric space u jm are metrizable so xm is locally metrizable to prove that xm is metrizable it suffices to show that in view of the smirnov metriz ability theorem xm is paracompact using the paracompactness of x and theorem 2 56 we find a closed locally finite refinement c cj j j in particular cj uj so that cjm u jm since u jm is metrizable it is also paracompact so that cjm is paracompact as a closed subspace of u j m hence cm c j m j j is a locally finite family of closed subsets of xm and each c j m is paracompact thus by proposition 2 57 the space xm is paracompact and since it is hausdorff and locally metrizable it is metrizable finally choosing a metric dm defining the topology on xm we set d x y m 0 1 2 m dm x y 1 dm x y the metric d defines the topology on x 2 6 3 proof of proposition 2 19 proof of proposition 2 19 1 in order to prove that b defines a basis for a topology on tx we take two sets w 1 and w 2 in b and assume that x v o c e h w 1 w 2 we claim that there exists a set w b satisfying w w 1 w 2 by definition w i t i 1 wi where i vi oi ci ei is a chart and wi is an open subset of toi containing xi i vi oi ci ei hi for i 1 2 this means that xi x and hi t i 1 x h for i 1 2 30 and moreover i xi hi i x hi wi we define w i t i 1 x 1 wi and observe that the wi s are open subsets of toi by 30 x h w 1 w 2 and if w w 1 w 2 and w t 1 w then x v o c e h w w 1 w 2 58 consequently b defines a topology on tx to prove that this topology is hausdorff we take two distinct elements x v o c e h and x v o c e h in the tangent space tx since 6 either x 6 x or if x x then h 6 t 1 x h in the first case x 6 x we may replace v and v by smaller open neighborhoods of x and x so that v v and then replace o c e resp o c e by the retracts v c e resp v c e if w resp w is an open neighborhood of x h resp x h in to resp to then w t 1 w resp w t 1 w is an open neighborhood of resp in tx and w w in the second case x x and h 6 t 1 x h we choose an open neighborhood w of x h in to and an open neighborhood w of x h in to so that w t 1 w then w t 1 w and w t 1 w moreover both sets are open and their inter section is empty consequently the topology defined by b is hausdorff 2 we start by proving that p tx x 1 is an open map it suffices to show that p w is open in x 1 for every element w b let v o c e be a chart on x and let t tv to be the associated map defined above and introduce w t 1 w for the open subset w of to we denote by to o 1 the projection onto the first factor this map is continuous and open moreover p w 1 t w since by construction the map t tv to is open and v o is a homeomorphism the composition on the right hand side is an open subset of x 1 hence p w is open in x 1 as claimed to show that the projection map p tx x 1 is continuous it suffices to show that given a chart v o c e on x and an open subset u of x 1 satisfying u v 1 the preimage p 1 u is open for such a chart and open set u we have p 1 u t 1 u e to since u e to is open in to the set on the left hand side belongs to b hence the set p 1 u is open and the projection p is continuous as 59 claimed 3 we start with an atlas v v j j oj cj ej j j such that the family v v j j j of domains is an open locally finite cover of x the associated maps t j tv j toj are homeomorphisms and since toj is metrizable the same holds for the open sets tv j hence tx is locally metrizable to show that tx is metrizable it remains to show that tx is paracompact by theorem 2 56 there exists a closed locally finite refinement c cj j j of v so that c 1 c j 1 j j is a closed locally finite refinement of v 1 v j 1 j j the sets kj to cj 1 x cj 1 txo are closed in to so that the sets k j t j 1 kj are closed subsets of tv in particular each k j is paracompact as a closed subset of metrizable space also the family k j j j is locally finite indeed let x v o c e h tx then there exists an open neighborhood u x of x in x 1 intersecting at most finitely many c j 1 s say with indices j belonging to a finite subset j j moreover since x 1 is regular u x can be taken so small that also x c j 1 for j j then setting w x to u x y u x tyo the set w x is an open subset of to and w x t 1 w x intersects only those k j whose indices j belong to j now applying proposition 2 57 we conclude that the tangent space tx is paracompact and hence metrizable in view of the smirnov metrizability theorem this finishes the proof of the proposition 60 3 basic sc fredholm theory in this chapter we start with the fredholm theory in the sc framework since sc maps are more flabby than c maps we do not have an implicit function theorem for all sc smooth maps however for a restricted class which occurs in the applications of the theory such a theorem is available we start with a figure illustrating a finite dimensional m polyfold showing what to expect from the fredholm theory of course our interest is in the infinite dimensional case figure 2 the top part of the figure shows a finite dimensional m polyfold which is a smooth space assume that we have a bundle in this extended category which has jumps of dimensions coordinated with the base then a smooth generic section would produce a solution set which looks like the one depicted in the lower part of the figure 3 1 sc fredholm sections and some of the main re sults the section is devoted to the basic notions and the description of the results leading to implicit function theorems our overall goal is the notion of a sc fredholm section of a tame strong bundle p y x as defined in definition 61 2 51 tameness of the bundle requires that x is a tame m polyfold as defined in definition 2 37 the section will end with some useful implicit function theorems the more sophisticated perturbation and transversality results are de scribed in a later section we start by introducing various types of germs in the sc context as usual we denote by e be a sc banach space and by c e a partial quadrant of e the sc banach space e is equipped with the filtration e 0 e e 1 e m 0 em definition 3 1 a sc germ of neighborhoods around 0 c denoted by o c 0 is a decreasing sequence u 0 u 1 u 2 where um is a relatively open neighborhoods of 0 in c em the tangent of o c 0 denoted by to c 0 is the decreasing sequence u 1 e 0 u 2 e 1 a special example of a sc germ of neighborhoods around 0 c e is a relatively open neighborhood u of c containing 0 which is equipped with the induced sc structure defined by the filtration um u em m 0 if e is infinite dimensional the sets um is this example are not bounded in em since the inclusions em e 0 are compact operators another example is the decreasing sequence um u bem 1 m 0 em where b em 1 m 0 is the open ball in em centered at 0 and radius 1 m presents a sc germ of neighborhoods here the sets um are bounded in em for m 0 we point out that the size of the sets um in definition 3 1 does not matter in the applications the size of um quite often decreases rapidly definition 3 2 a sc 000 germ f o c 0 f into the sc banach space f is a continuous map f u 0 f such that f um fm and f um fm is continuous a sc 111 germ f o c 0 f is a sc 0 germ which is of class sc 1 in the sense that there exists for every x u 1 a bounded linear operator df x l e 0 f 0 such that for h u 1 with x h u 1 lim h 1 0 f x h f x df x h 0 h 1 0 62 moreover tf u 1 e 0 tf defined by tf x h f x df x h satis fies tf um 1 em fm 1 fm and tf to c 0 tf is a sc 0 germ we say f is a sc 2 germ provided tf is sc 1 etc if the the germ f is a sck germ for every k we call it a sc smooth germ if we write f o o 0 f 0 we indicate that f 0 0 we shall be mostly interested in sc germs f o c 0 f from definition 2 50 we recall the strong bundle chart p 1 v k u f of a strong bundle p y x over the m polyfold x illustrated by the commutative diagram p 1 v k p y yp v o in the diagram v x is an open set and the maps and are homeomor phisms moreover k r u f is the image of the strong bundle retraction r and o r u is the image of the sc smooth retraction r u u of the relatively open set u of the the partial quadrant c in the sc banach space e definition 3 3 a sc smooth section germ f x 0 of the strong bundle p y x is a continuous section f v p 1 v on the open neighbor hood v of the smooth point x 0 for which the following holds there exists a strong bundle chart p 1 v k u f satisfying x 0 0 o in which the principal part f of the local continuous section f f 1 o k u f has the property that the composition f r o c 0 f is a sc smooth germ as defined in definition 3 2 to recall the section f o k u f is of the form f p p f p for p o and f o f is called its principal part by abuse of the notation we shall often use the same letter for the principal part as for the section in the next step we introduce the useful notion of a filling of a sc smooth section germ f 0 of a tame strong local bundle k o near the given 63 smooth point 0 the notion of a filling is a new concept specific to the world of retracts in all known applications it deals successfully with bubbling off phenomena and similar singular phenomena definition 3 4 filling we consider a tame strong local bundle k o we recall that k r u f where u c e is a relatively open neighborhood of 0 in the partial quadrant c of the sc banach space e and f is a sc banach space moreover r is a strong bundle retraction of the form r u h r u u h covering the tame retraction r u u onto o r u and u f f is a bounded linear operator we assume that r 0 0 a sc smooth section germ f 0 of the bundle k o possesses a filling if there exists a sc smooth section germ g 0 of the bundle u f u extending f and having the following properties 1 f x g x for x o close to 0 2 if g y r y g y for a point y u near 0 then y o 3 the linearization of the map y 7 1 r y g y at the point 0 restricted to ker dr 0 defines a topological linear isomorphism ker dr 0 ker 0 the crucial property of a filler is the fact that the solution sets y o f y 0 and y u g y 0 coincide near y 0 indeed if y u is a solution of the filled section g so that g y 0 then it follows from 2 that y o and from 1 that f y 0 the section g is however much easier to analyze than the section f whose domain of definition has a rather complicated structure it turns out that in the applications these extensions g are surprisingly easy to detect in the gromov witten theory and the sft they seem almost canonical the condition 3 plays a role in the comparison of the linearizations df 0 and dg 0 assuming that f 0 0 g 0 as we are going to explain next it follows from the definition of a retract that r y r y r y hence since y 0 o we have r 0 0 and 0 0 0 so that 0 is a linear sc projection in f and we obtain the sc splitting f 0 f 1 0 f 64 similarly it follows from r r y r y for y u that dr 0 dr 0 dr 0 so that dr 0 is a linear sc projection in e which gives rise to the sc splitting e dr 0 e 1 dr 0 e we recall that the linearization tf 0 of the section f o k at y 0 r 0 is defined as the restriction of the derivative d f r 0 of the map f r u f to t 0 o from r y f r y f r y for y u close to 0 we obtain using f 0 0 by linearization at y 0 the relation 0 tf 0 tf 0 from g r y f r y for y u near 0 we deduce tg 0 tf 0 on t 0 o from the identity 1 r y g r y 0 for y u near 0 we deduce using g 0 0 the relation 1 0 dg 0 dr 0 0 hence the matrix representation of dg 0 e f with respect to the above split tings of e and f looks as follows dg 0 tf 0 0 dg 0 1 dr 0 0 1 0 dg 0 1 dr 0 in view of property 3 the linear map 7 1 0 dg 0 1 dr 0 from 1 dr 0 e to 1 d 0 f is an isomorphism of banach spaces therefore kernel dg 0 kernel tf 0 0 moreover the filler has the following additional properties proposition 3 5 filler assume f has the filling g and f 0 0 1 the operator tf 0 dr 0 e 0 f is surjective if and only if the operator dg 0 e f is surjective 2 tf 0 is a fredholm operator in the classical sense if and only if dg 0 is a fredholm operator and indtf 0 inddg 0 proof 2 to simplify the notation we abbreviate the above matrix repre senting dg 0 by dg 0 a b 0 c and abbreviate the above splittings by e e 0 e 1 and f f 0 f 1 the operators in the matrix are bounded between corresponding banach spaces 65 and c e 1 f 1 is an isomorphism of banach spaces therefore if b 0 the operator a df 0 e 0 f 0 is fredholm if and only if the operator a 0 0 c e f is fredholm in which case their indices agree the statement 2 now follows from the composition formula 1 bc 1 0 1 a 0 0 c a b 0 c since the first factor is an isomorphism from f to f and hence has index equal to 0 and the fredholm indices of a composition are additive 1 the statement 1 is an immediate consequence of our assumption that c is an isomorphism to sum up the role of a filler instead of studying the solution set of the section f o k we can as well study the solution set of the filled section g u u f which is defined on the relatively open set u of the partial quadrant c in the sc space e and which therefore is easier to analyze definition 3 6 filled version if f is a sc smooth section of the tame strong bundle p y x and x 0 x a smooth point we say that section germ f x 0 has a filling if there exists a strong bundle chart as defined in definition 2 50 1 v k covering v x 0 7 o 0 where k o is a tame strong local bundle containing 0 o u such that the section germ f 1 o k u f has a filling g u u f near 0 we shall refer to the section germ g 0 as a filled version of f x 0 the next concept is that of a basic germ definition 3 7 basic germ let w be a sc banach space and c 0 k rn k w a partial quadrant then a basic germ is a sc smooth germ f o c 0 rn w 66 satisfying f 0 0 and having the following property if p rn w w denotes the projection the germ p f o c 0 w 0 has the form p f a w w b a w for a w 0 k rn k w where b 0 0 0 moreover for every 0 and every integer m 0 the estimate b a w b a w m w w m holds if a w and a w are close enough to 0 0 on level m remark 3 8 the notion of basic class was introduced in 21 where however we did not require f 0 0 instead we required that p f f 0 has a form as described in definition 3 11 the later developments convinced us that it is more convenient to require that f 0 0 lemma 3 9 let b 0 k rn k w w be a sc smooth germ around 0 satisfying the properties described in definition 3 7 then for every 0 and m 0 d 2 b a w m m 31 for all wm if a w em 1 is close enough to 0 0 in em in particu lar d 2 b 0 0 0 proof since wm 1 wm is dense it is sufficient to verify the estimate for wm 1 satisfying m 1 1 for such a we know from the definition of the linearization recalling proposition 1 17 that b a w b a w t d 2 b a w t o t where w t c o t t m 0 as t 0 therefore d 2 b a w m 1 t d 2 b a w t m 1 t b a w b a w t m 1 t o t m the first term on the right hand side is estimated by m if a w and a w t are sufficiently small in em therefore the estimate 31 follows as t 0 we will see that basic germs have special properties as already the fol lowing application of lemma 3 9 demonstrates 67 proposition 3 10 let f 0 k rn k w e rn w be a sc smooth germ around f 0 0 of the form f h s where h is a basic germ and s a sc germ then df 0 rn w rn w is a sc fredholm operator and its index is equal to inddf 0 n n moreover for every m 0 df a w rn wm rn wm is a fredholm operator having index n n if a w em 1 is sufficiently small in em proof with the sc projection p rn w w the linearization of f at the smooth point 0 df 0 p df 0 1 p df 0 is explicitly given by the formula df 0 a w w d 2 b 0 w d 1 b 0 a 1 p df 0 a w ds 0 a w by lemma 3 9 d 2 b 0 0 therefore the operator df 0 is a sc perturbation of the operator rn w rn w a w 7 0 w 32 the operator 32 is a sc fredholm operator whose kernel is equal to rn and whose cokernel is rn so that its fredholm index is equal to n n since df 0 is a sc perturbation of a sc fredholm operator it is also a sc fredholm operator by proposition 1 10 because sc operators are compact if considered on the same level the fredholm index is unchanged and so inddf 0 n n the second statement follows from the fact that the linear operator df a w rn wm rn wm is a compact perturbation of the oper ator a w 7 0 1 d 2 b a w w 33 choosing 0 1 in lemma 3 9 the operator 1 d 2 b a w wm wm is an isomorphism of banach spaces if a w em 1 is sufficiently small in 68 em hence the operator 33 is a fredholm operator of index n n and the proposition follows finally we are in a position to introduce the sc fredholm germs definition 3 11 sc fredholm germ let f be a sc smooth section of the strong bundle p y x over the tame m polyfold x and let x 0 x be a smooth point then f x 0 is a sc fredholm germ provided it possesses a filled version g 0 u u f according to definition 3 6 and having the following property there exists a local sc section s u u f satisfying s 0 g 0 such that the germ g s 0 u u f is conjugated to a basic germ the last condition requires the existence of a strong bundle isomorphism u f u f covering the sc diffeomorphism u u such that the push forward section g s 1 u u f is a basic germ from proposition 3 10 we deduce that the linearization d g s 0 at the point 0 is a sc fredholm operator consequently dg 0 is a sc fredholm operator by proposition 1 10 and so the tangent map tf x 0 tx 0 x yf x 0 y is a linear fredholm operator having the same index as dg 0 namely indtf x 0 n n in view of the properties of a filler in proposition 3 5 the above definition of a sc fredholm germ looks very complicated one first has to find a filled version which then after some correction by a sc section is conjugated to a basic germ it turns out that the definition of a sc fredholm germ is extremely practicable in the applications we have in mind by experience one may say that the fillings which are usually only needed near data describing bubbling off situations seem almost natural i e if one sees one example one has seen them all examples of fillings in the gromov witten sft and floer theory can be found in 27 28 the subtraction of a suitable sc section is in applications essentially the removing of lower order terms of a nonlinear differential operator and therefore allows tremendous simplifications of the expressions before one tries to conjugate them to a basic 69 germ one also has to keep in mind that the sc fredholm theory is designed to cope with spaces whose tangent spaces have locally varying dimensions on which on the analytical side one studies systems of partial differential equations on varying domains into varying codomains later on we shall give criteria which in practice are easy to check to verify that a section is conjugated to a basic germ sc fredholm germs possess a useful local compactness property theorem 3 12 local compactness for sc fredholm germs let f be a sc smooth section of the tame strong bundle p y x and x 0 x a smooth point we assume that f x 0 is a sc fredholm germ satisfying f x 0 0 then there exist a nested sequence of open neighborhood o i of x 0 in x 0 for i 0 o 0 o 1 o i o i 1 such that for every i the x 0 closure clx 0 x o i f x 0 is a compact subset of xi we emphasize that the o i are open neighborhoods in x i e on level 0 the result is an immediate consequence of theorem 3 40 which will be introduced later and has the following corollary corollary 3 13 let f be a sc smooth section of the tame strong bundle p y x and x 0 x a smooth point we assume that f x 0 is a sc fredholm germ satisfying f x 0 0 if xk x is a sequence satisfying f xk 0 and xk x in x 0 then it follows for every given any m 0 that xk xm for k large and xk x in xm definition 3 14 sc fredholm section a section f of the tame strong bundle p y x over the m polyfod x is called sc fredholm section if it has the following three properties 1 f is sc smooth 2 f is regularizing i e if x xm and f x ym m 1 then x xm 1 3 the germ f x is a sc fredholm germ at every smooth point x x 70 the implicit function theorem introduced later on is applicable to sc fredholm sections and will lead to the following local result near a smooth interior point x 0 x i e dx x 0 0 we assume that f x 0 0 then the linearization f x 0 tx 0 x yx 0 is a sc fredholm operator moreover if f x 0 is surjective then the solution set x x f x 0 near x 0 has the structure of a finite dimensional smooth manifold in the classical sense whose dimension agrees with the fredholm index its smooth structure is in a canonical way induced from the m polyfold structure of x in case that x is a boundary point so that dx x 1 we can only expect the solution set to be reasonable provided the kernel of f x lies in good position to the boundary of x and the boundary x is sufficiently well behaved in order that x is regular enough we have required that x is a tame m polyfold so that we can ask ker f x to be in good position to the partial quadrant cxx in txx a notion which we shall introduce later on if p y x is a tame strong bundle we denote by p the vector space of sc smooth sections by fred p we denote the subset of p consisting of sc fredholm sections finally by p we denote the vector space of sc sections as introduced in definition 2 52 the following stability property of a sc fredholm section will be crucial for the transversality theory theorem 3 15 stability under sc perturbations let p y x be a strong bundle over the tame m polyfold x if f fred p and s p then f s fred p in order to prove the theorem we need two lemmata for local strong bundles we recall the local strong bundle retract k c f e f from definition 2 48 consisting of the retract k r u f where r u f u f is a strong bundle retraction of the form r u h r u u h in which r u u is a smooth retraction onto o r u u we shall denote the principal parts of the sections of the bundles u f u and k o by bold letters 71 lemma 3 16 a sc section s o k as defined in definition 2 49 possesses an extension to a sc section s u u f s u u s u having the following properties 1 s u s u if u o 2 r r u s u s r u if u u proof if s o k is given by s u u s u u o we define the section s u u f by s u u s u u s r u u u clearly s is a sc section of the bundle u f u and we claim that its restriction to o agrees with the section s indeed if u o then r u u implying s u s r u r u s r r u r u s r u u s u s u as claimed moreover using that s u r s u if u o r r u s u r r u s r u r s r u s r u for u u lemma 3 17 let f o k be a sc smooth section of the previous local strong bundle retract and let s o k be a sc section if f possesses the filler g u u f then f s has the filler g s u u f where s is the extension of s constructed in the previous lemma proof we have to verify that the section g s meets the three conditions in definition 3 4 the properties 1 and 2 for g s follow immediately from the properties 1 and 2 for the filler g and the properties 1 and 2 for the section s in lemma 3 16 in order to verify property 3 of a filler we have to linearize the map u 7 1 r u g u s u at the point u 0 since 1 r u s u 1 r u s r u 0 by property 2 of lemma 3 16 the linearization agrees with the linearization of the map 1 r u g u which satisfies the required property 3 since g is a filler the proof of lemma 3 17 is finished 72 proof of theorem 3 15 let f be a sc fredholm section of the tame strong bundle p y x and let s x y be a sc section of p then f s is a sc smooth section which is also regularizing it remains to verify that f s x is a sc fredholm germ for every smooth point x x by definition of sc fredholm f x is a sc fredholm germ at the smooth point x therefore there exists an open neighborhood v of x and a strong bundle chart v p 1 v k u f as defined in definition 2 50 and satisfying x 0 o such that the local representation f f f 1 o k of the section f possesses a filled version g u u f around 0 which after subtraction of a suitable sc section is conjugated to a basic germ around 0 define t s then t o k is a sc section by lemma 3 16 there is a particular sc section t u u f extending t by lemma 3 17 the section g t u u f is a filling of f t in view of the sc fredholm germ property there exists a sc section t satisfying t 0 g 0 and such that g t is conjugated to a basic germ now taking the sc section t t u u f we have g t 0 t t 0 moreover g t t t g t which as we already know is conjugated to a basic germ to sum up we have verified that f s x is a sc fredholm germ this holds true for every smooth point x x consequently the section f s is a fredholm section and the proof of theorem 3 15 is complete in order to formulate a parametrized version of proposition 3 15 we as sume that p y x is a strong bundle and f a sc fredholm section the sc smooth projection rn x x r x 7 x pulls back the bundle p to the strong bundle p y rn x the section f of p defined by f r x r x f x is a sc fredholm section as is readily verified if s 1 sn are sc sections of p then s r x r x n i 1 ri si x is a sc section of the pull back bundle p and by the stability theorem 3 15 the section r x 7 f r x s r x is a sc fredholm section of p hence we have proved the following sta bility result 73 theorem 3 18 parameterized perturbations let p y x be a tame strong bundle and f a sc fredholm section if s 1 sn p then the map rn x y r x 7 f x n i 1 ri si x defines a sc fredholm section of the bundle p y rn x this theorem and refined versions of the theorem play a role in the pertur bation and transversality theory as already pointed out the distinguished class of sc fredholm sections allows to apply an implicit function theorem in the usual sense we first formulate the implicit function theorem at an interior point note that a m polyfold x with an identically vanishing de generacy map dx is tame theorem 3 19 implicit function theorem interior case assume that p y x is a strong bundle over the m polyfold x satisfying dx 0 and f a sc fredholm section suppose that x 0 x is a smooth point in x such that f x 0 0 then the linearization f x 0 tx 0 x yx 0 is a sc fredholm operator if f x 0 surjective then there exists an open neigh borhood u of x 0 x such that the solution set s f u x u f x 0 in u has in a natural way the structure of a smooth finite dimensional man ifold whose dimension agrees with the fredholm index in addition u can be chosen in such a way that the linearization f y tyx yy for y s f u is surjective and ker f y tys f u is the tangent space theorem 3 19 is an immediate consequence of theorem 3 54 in section 3 6 as we shall see the smooth manifold structure on s f u is induced from the m polyfold structure of x considering a sc fredholm section f of the strong bundle y x over the m polyfoldx having no boundary i e dx 0 we assume in addition that the m polyfold x admits a sc smooth partition of unity then there exists for two given smooth point x x and e yx a sc section s supported near x and satisfying s x e for the easy proof we refer to 21 as we shall see later it suffices to assume the existence of sc smooth bump functions instead of sc smooth partitions of unity if f x 0 0 and f x 0 is not surjective we find finitely many smooth elements e 1 ek yx 0 satisfying r f x 0 re 1 rek yx 0 taking 74 the sc 1 sections si satisfying si x 0 ei we define the map f rk x y by f r x f x k i 1 risi x the linearization of f at the distinguished point 0 x 0 rk x is the continuous linear map f 0 x 0 h u f x 0 u k i 1 hiei which is surjective by theorem 3 18 and theorem 3 54 we find an open neighborhood u of 0 x 0 rk x such that the solution set of s f u r x u f x k i 1 ri si x 0 is a smooth finite dimensional man ifold the trivial bundle s f u rk s f u has the canonical section r y 7 r the zero set of this section is precisely the unperturbed solution set of f y 0 for y u if the solution set of f y 0 y x is compact we can carry out the previous construction globally which gives rise to global finite dimensional reduction this will be discussed later on remark 3 20 we should point out that in the original proof of theorem 3 54 in 21 theorem 4 6 and proposition 4 7 the sc fredholm section is defined slightly differently namely as follows in 21 a sc smooth section f of the strong bundle y x is called sc fredholm if it possesses around all smooth points of x a filled version g 0 such that g g 0 near 0 is conjugated to a basic germ it is in this case not true that f s is sc fredholm for sc section s however by a nontrivial theorem in 21 theorem 3 9 increasing the level the section f s 1 of the the strong bundle y 1 x 1 is sc fredholm although not harmful in practice this looks unsatisfactory this is why we have introduced the new definition definition 3 11 of sc fredholm where we require for the filled version g 0 that there exists a local sc section s u u f such that s 0 g 0 and g s is locally conjugated to a basic germ if now t is a sc section then the section f t of the bundle y x is automatically sc fredholm in view of theorem 3 15 the difficulty of the nontrivial theorem is now hidden in the proof of the implicit function theorem which has to incorporate the arguments of the nontrivial theorem with the new definition even if we want to study f only we have only normal forms for the perturbed expression which might 75 be unrelated to our problem however writing f f s s we know how f s looks like and we know that s is a compact perturbation of f s we combine these facts to gain sufficient information about f 1 to determine in view the regularizing property of sc fredholm sections the solution set of f let us briefly sketch the construction of the manifold structure of the solution set theorem 3 19 is a local result so that we can work without loss of generality with a section f in a strong local bundle k o whose local model is o e e containing 0 o by the fredholm requirement we may assume without loss of generality by passing to a suitable filling at 0 that we have a section g of v f v which has the following properties we have that f g on o and the germ g 0 is conjugated to a basic germ note that for x 6 0 near 0 the germ g x might not have this property however if x o then f x after a possible coordinate change has a filling which might look quite different than the one we used at 0 which is conjugated to a basic germ after correction by a sc section we point out that different fillings are needed in the proof in order to get the smoothness of s f u at points other than 0 the proof of the theorem shows that locally the solution set of f 0 near 0 can be written as follows if n ker f x ker g 0 and if y is a sc complement in e so that e n y then there exists a sc smooth map n u 0 y satisfying 0 0 and d 0 0 such that graph u 0 e a a a parametrizes all solutions of g 0 and f 0 in a suitable neighborhood of 0 in particular by the definition of a filler the image of the map graph lies in o the inverse of the map graph is the restriction of the projection n y n to the solution set which is sc smooth in order to formulate the boundary version of the implicit function theo rem we start with some preparation definition 3 21 in good position let c e be a partial quadrant in the sc banach space e and n e be a finite dimensional sc subspace of e the subspace n is in good position to the partial quadrant c if the interior of n c in n is non empty and if n possesses a sc complement p so that e n p having the following property there exists 0 such that for pairs n p n p satisfying p 0 n 0 the statements n c and n p c are equivalent we call such a sc complement p a good complement 76 the choice of the right complement p is important one cannot take a random sc complement of n in general as lemma 3 65 demonstrates in view of proposition 1 6 the finite dimensional sunspace n in definition 3 21 possessing the sc complement p is necessarily a smooth subspace a finite dimensional subspace n which is not necessarily smooth is called in good position to the partial quadrant c in the sc banach space e if there exists a merely topological complement p in e satisfying the requirements of definition 3 21 for some 0 c np c n p n c 0 a b figure 3 in figure a n is in good position to c while in figure b n is not in good position to c the following result is taken from 21 proposition 6 1 its proof is re produced in appendix 3 8 1 proposition 3 22 if n is a finite dimensional sc subspace in good position to the partial quadrant c in e then n c is a partial quadrant in n the boundary version of the implicit function theorem is formulated in the next theorem the proof is again given later theorem 3 23 implicit function theorem boundary case we assume that p y x is a strong bundle over the tame m polyfold x and f is a sc fredholm section suppose that x x satisfies f x 0 and the following two properties 77 1 the linearisation f x txx yx is surjective 2 the kernel n of f x is in good position to the boundary of x i e n is in good position to the partial quadrant cxx in the tangent space txx then there exists an open neighborhood u of x such that the following holds 1 the local solution set s f u y u f y 0 which consists of smooth points is a tame sub m polyfold of x 2 the tame sub m polyfold s f u admits a uniquely determined struc ture as a smooth manifold with boundary with corners this m polyfold structure on s f u is the same as the one defined in proposition 2 21 theorem 3 23 is a consequence of theorem 3 54 in section 3 6 in the proof of theorem 3 23 we shall describe the manifold structure on the solution space in detail here we just indicate how it looks like since s f u x is a tame m polyfold we can take for a point y s f u a sc diffeomorphism u y o o 0 where o c e is a tame retract then if t v v satisfies o t v we have the splitting e t 0 o 1 dt 0 e with y 1 dt 0 e contained in tr 0 c also the proof will show that t 0 o is finite dimensional let p dt 0 be the projection onto t 0 o then it will be shown that near 0 the projection p u 0 v 0 is a sc diffeomorphism where u is an open neighborhood of 0 in o and v is an open neighborhood of 0 in c 0 o then for u 1 u the map u v y 7 p y is a sc diffeomorphism and its mage lies in an relatively open neighborhood of 0 in the partial quadrant c 0 o in t 0 o the associated transition maps for any two such sc diffeomorphisms are trivially sc diffeomorphisms between rela tively open subsets in partial quadrants of finite dimensional vector spaces hence they are classically smooth this shows that the system of such sc diffeomorphisms defines a smooth atlas for the structure of a manifold with boundary with corners and by construction this structure is compatible with the existing m polyfold structure on s f u as a corollary of theorem 3 23 we shall obtain the following result corollary 3 24 let p y x be a strong bundle over the tame m polyfold x and f be a sc fredholm section suppose that for every x x satisfying 78 f x 0 the linearisation f x txx yx is surjective and the kernel ker f x is in good position to the boundary of x the latter being an empty condition if dx x 0 then the solution set m x x f x 0 x is a sub m polyfold of x for which the induced structure is tame and which moreover admits a sc smoothly equivalent structure as a smooth manifold with boundary with corners the remaining subsections are devoted to the proof of the above results since the fredholm theory is one of the main parts of the polyfold theory and draws heavily on the possibilities offered in the sc smooth theory we shall carry out the constructions in great details 3 2 subsets with tangent structure the solution sets of sc fredholm sections will come with a certain structure which in the generic case will induce a natural smooth manifold on the so lution set this subsection studies this structure recall the definition of a smooth finite dimensional subspace n in good position to the partial quad rant c definition 3 21 for such a subspace n c is a partial quadrant in n proposition 3 22 definition 3 25 n dimensional tangent germ property we consider a tame m polyfold x and a subset m x of x the subset m has the n dimensional tangent germ property provided the following holds 1 m x 2 every point x m lies in an open neighborhood u x of x such that there exists a sc smooth chart u x o 0 onto a tame retract o c e moreover there exists a n dimensional smooth subspace n e in good position to the partial quadrant c which possesses a good complement y so that e n y in addition there exists a relatively open neighborhood v of 0 in the partial quadrant n c and a continuous map v y having the following properties i m u v v v v n y ii o n c 0 y 0 is a sc germ satisfying 0 0 and d 0 0 79 c n p u m figure 4 recalling the definition of a sc germ definition 3 2 we note that here v is a relatively open neighborhood of 0 in the partial quadrant n c where n is a smooth finite dimensional space there exists a nested sequence vm of relatively open neighborhoods of 0 in n c say v v 0 v 1 v 2 such that vm ym and vm ym is continuous denoting this sequence of neighborhoods by o n c 0 its tangent is the nested sequence tv 1 tv 2 tv 2 denoted by to n c 0 if x v 1 then the map d x is defined and since is sc germ the tangent map t to n c 0 ty is again of class sc 1 iteratively it follows that t is a sc germ proposition 3 26 for a pair x m in which x is a tame m polyfold and m a subset of x the property that m has the n dimensional tangent germ property is a sc diffeomorphism invariant more precisely if x m is a second pair in which x is a tame m polyfold and m a subset of x and if x x is a sc diffeomorphism satisfying m m then m has the n dimensional tangent germ property if and only if m has the n dimensional tangent germ property proof from x x we conclude that x is tame we show that if m x has the n dimensional tangent germ property then m x has this prop erty too since m x and is sc smooth we see that m m x 80 let m m and choose a point m m satisfying m m by assump tion there exists a sc smooth chart u m o 0 where o c e is a tame retract by assumption there exists a smooth n dimensional linear sub space n in good position to c with sc complement y and a continuous map v y where v is a relatively open neighborhood of 0 in cn c n which satisfies i m u v v v v n y ii o cn 0 y 0 is a sc germ satisfying 0 0 and d 0 0 to deduce the corresponding construction for x m we define the open neighborhood u x of m m by u u and the sc smooth chart by 1 u m o 0 then u m u m v v v v and the lemma follows the important aspect of the n dimensional tangent germ property of a subset is the following result theorem 3 27 if x is a tame m polyfold and m x a subset possessing the n dimensional tangent germ property then the following holds 1 m is a sub m polyfold of x whose induced m polyfold structure is tame moreover the induced m polyfold structure on m is sc smoothly equiv alent to a smooth structure of a manifold with boundary with corners on m 2 if x m is given we denote by u n v n and v y the data described in condition 2 of definition 3 25 denoting by n y n the sc projection the map u m v given by y 7 y defines a smooth chart on m around the point x proof we choose a point x m and find an open neighborhood u x of x and a m polyfold chart u x o 0 onto the retract o c e so that the set m u is represented as m u v v v v n y 81 the map v y possesses all the properties listed in condition 2 of definition 3 25 the map m u v is of the form y v y v y with the sc projection n y n onto n the map m u v y v y 34 is continuous and bijective onto v it is the restriction of the sc smooth map u n which maps the point x m onto 0 n then the inverse of 34 v m u v 1 v v has its image inx and as a map into anyxm has arbitrarily high regularity if only v is close enough to 0 depending on m next we shall show that the map is sc on all of v and not only at the point 0 v to this aim we choose a v 0 v and put x 0 1 v 0 v 0 by construction x 0 m and by our assumption there is a sc smooth chart u x 0 o 0 satisfying m u w w w v where v is a relatively open neighborhood of 0 in the smooth n dimensional subspace n e possessing the tangent germ property the map v y possesses the properties listed in condition 2 of definition 3 25 in particular is a sc germ at the point w 0 for v v near v 0 and w v near 0 we consider the equation v 1 w w 35 if v v 0 we have the solution w 0 near 0 the map possesses arbitrary high classical differentiability into any level linearizing the right hand side of the equation at the point 0 and recalling that d 0 0 we obtain the linear isomorphism h 7 t 1 0 h from n onto n by the classically implicit function theorem we obtain a germ v 7 w v for v close to v 0 satisfying w v 0 0 and solving the equation 35 the germ has arbitrary high classical differentiability once we are close enough to v 0 now consider the map v 7 1 w v w v 36 82 for v near v 0 since v 7 w v has arbitrarily high differentiability at v 0 and is sc germ near w 0 we see that the map 36 has into any given level arbitrarily high differentiability for v near v 0 consequently the map is a sc germ near w 0 the image of the map lies in the infinity level applying the sc projection 1 n y y we obtain the identity v 1 1 w v w v which implies that is a sc germ near v 0 since v 0 is arbitrary in v we see that v 7 v is a sc germ around every v 0 v as we wanted to show moreover we conclude that the map v x v 1 v v is an injective sc smooth map whose image is equal to m u next we shall verify that the set m is a sub m polyfold of x according to definition 2 21 by construction we have so far at every point x m an open neighborhood u u x x and a sc smooth chart u o satisfying x 0 where o c e is a tame sc smooth retract moreover recalling the sc splitting e n y there is a relatively open neighborhood v of 0 in the partial quadrant n c of n and a sc smooth map v y satisfying 0 0 and d 0 0 such that m u v v v v the map v u v 7 1 v v is sc smooth and injective the subset c defined by v y c v v y y is relatively open in c and contains 0 since o is a tame retract there exist a relatively open subset w of c and a tame sc smooth retraction r w w onto o r w consequently in view of r r 1 o r 1 o the subset o is also a sc smooth retract 83 by construction v v o and also v v and we define the map t o o by t v w v v the map t is sc smooth and satisfies t t t so that t is a sc smooth retraction defined on a relatively open neighborhood of 0 in c and t o m u therefore the composition s 1 t defines a sc smooth retraction s u u 37 onto m u s u proving that the subset m is a sc smooth sub m polyfold of x the map u 7 c n u 7 s u is sc smooth therefore the map m u v m 7 m is a sc smooth m polyfold chart on m for the induced m polyfold structure the image of the chart is the local model v n c n so that the transition maps are classically smooth maps and define on m the structure of a manifold with boundary with corners the proof of theorem 3 27 is complete as an aside we mention that in general we can not find a local retraction s in 37 which is tame as the example x 0 2 and m x x x 0 shows the strength of the theorem stems from the fact that in our sc fredholm theory the machinery produces subsetsm x which have the n dimensional tangent germ property 3 3 contraction germs the notion of a contraction germ is a slight modification of a basic germ these germs are convenient for the proof of the implicit function theorem theorem 3 33 which is the main result of this section it turns out that the local geometry of sc fredholm germs are intimately related to contraction germs in the generic case they are used to prove that the zero set of a sc fredholm section must have the n dimensional tangent germ property it follows that the zero set is in a natural way a smooth manifold with boundary with corners 84 in the following we abbreviate by c the partial quadrant c 0 k rn k in rn so that c c w is a partial quadrant in the sc banach space e rn w definition 3 28 sc 0 contraction germ a sc 0 germ f o c 0 w 0 is called a sc 0 contraction germ if the following holds the germ f o c 0 w 0 has the form f a w w b a w for a w close to 0 0 c moreover for every 0 and m 0 the estimate b a w b a w m w w m holds for all a w a w on level m sufficiently close to 0 0 depending on and m more precisely the sc 0 contraction germ requires for given 0 that we can choose a perhaps smaller germ o c 0 of neighborhoods u 0 u 1 u 2 u 3 of the point 0 0 in 0 k rn k w such that b a u b a v m u v m holds if a u a v um starting on level 0 the parametrized version of banach fixed point the orem together with b 0 0 0 guarantee the existence of relatively open and connected neighborhood v v 0 of 0 in 0 k rn k and a uniquely determined continuous map v w 0 satisfying 0 0 and solving the equation a b a a for all a v going to level 1 we find again using the fixed point theorem an open neigh borhood v 1 v 0 of 0 and a continuous map 1 v 1 w 1 satisfying 0 0 and solving the equation on level 1 from the uniqueness of the solutions of the banach fixed point problem we conclude that 1 v 1 continuing this way we obtain a decreasing sequence of relatively open neighborhoods of 0 in 0 k rn k v v 0 v 1 v 2 such that the continuous solution v w satisfies 0 0 and vm wm and vm wm is continuous in other words we obtain a sc 0 solution germ o 0 k rn k 0 w 0 summarizing the discussion we have proved the following theorem from 21 theorem 2 2 85 theorem 3 29 existence a sc 0 contraction germ f o c w 0 w 0 admits a uniquely determined sc 0 solution germ o c 0 w 0 solving f graph 0 here graph is the associated graph germ a 7 a a our next aim is the regularity of the unique continuous solution germ of the equation f v v 0 guaranteed by theorem 3 29 and we are going to prove that the solution germ is of class sck if the given germ f is of class sck by a somewhat tricky induction it turns out that we actually only have to know that if f is sc 1 then the solution germ is sc 1 as well here we shall make use of the following regularity result from 21 theorem 2 3 which is the hard part of the regularity theory theorem 3 30 if the sc 0 contraction germ f o c w 0 w 0 is of class sc 1 then the solution germ o c 0 w 0 in theorem 3 29 is also of class sc 1 theorem 3 30 shows that a sc 0 contraction germ f of class sc 1 has a solution germ satisfying f v v 0 which is also of class sc 1 we shall use this to verify by induction that is of class sck if f is of class sck we start with the following lemma lemma 3 31 let f o c w 0 w 0 be a sc 0 contraction germ of class sck where k 1 moreover we assume that the solution germ is of class scj by theorem 3 30 is at least of class sc 1 we define the germ f 1 by f 1 o tc tw 0 tw f 1 v b u w u b v u w db v v b w u w b 1 v b u w 38 where the last line defines the map b 1 then f 1 is an sc 0 contraction germ and of class scmin k 1 j 86 proof for v small the map b 1 has the contraction property with respect to u w indeed on the m level of tw m wm 1 wm i e for u w wm 1 wm we estimate for given 0 and v sufficiently small b 1 v b u w b 1 v b u w m b v u b v u m 1 db v v b w db v v b w m u u m 1 d 2 b v v w w m which using the estimate d 2 b v v m for the operator norm from lemma 3 9 is estimated by u u m 1 w w m u w u w m consequently the germ f 1 is an sc 0 contraction germ if now f is of class sck and of class scj then the germ f 1 is of class scmin k 1 j as one verifies by comparing the tangent map tf with the map f 1 and using the fact that the solution is of class scj by theorem 3 29 the solution germ 1 of f 1 is at least of class sc 0 it solves the equation f 1 v b 1 v b 0 39 but also the tangent germ t defined by t v b v d v b is a solution of 39 from the uniqueness we conclude that 1 t to prove higher regularity we will also make use of the next lemma lemma 3 32 assume we are given a sc 0 contraction germ f of class sck and a solution germ of class scj with j k then there exists a sc 0 contraction germ f j of class scmin k j 1 having j t j as the solution germ proof we prove the lemma by induction with respect to j if j 0 and f is a sc 0 contraction germ of class sck k 0 then we set f 0 f and 0 hence the result holds true if j 0 assuming the result has been proved for j we show it is true for j 1 since j 1 1 and k j 1 the map f 1 defined by 38 is of class scmin k 1 j 1 in view of lemma 3 31 moreover the solution germ 1 t satisfies f 1 graph 1 0 87 and is of class scj since min k 1 j 1 j by the induction hypothesis there exists a map f 1 j f j 1 of regularity class min min k 1 j 1 j 1 min k j 1 1 so that f j 1 graph 1 j 0 setting j 1 1 j t j t t j 1 lemma 3 32 follows the main result of this section is the following germ implicit functions theorem theorem 3 33 germ implicit function theorem if f o c w 0 w 0 is an sc 0 contraction germ which is in addition of class sck then the solution germ o c 0 w 0 satisfying f v v 0 is also of class sck from theorem 3 33 using proposition 1 17 and 1 18 and proposition 3 40 we deduce the following properties of the section germ under the additional assumptions that f is a sc smooth germ corollary 3 34 if the sc 0 contraction germ f is a sc smooth germ there exists for every m 0 and k 0 a relatively open neighborhoods vm k of 0 in c such that 1 vm k wm 2 vm k wm is of class ck in particular the solution germ is sc smooth at the smooth point 0 theorem 3 33 will be one of the building blocks for all future versions of implicit function theorems as well as for the transversality theory proof of theorem 3 33 arguing by contradiction we assume that the solu tion germ is of class scj for some j k but not of class scj 1 in view 88 of lemma 3 32 there exists an sc 0 contraction germ f j of class scmin k j 1 such that j t j satisfies f j graph j 0 since also k j 1 it follows that f j is at least of class sc 1 consequently the solution germ j is at least of class sc 1 since j t j we conclude that is at least of class scj 1 contradicting our assumption the proof of theorem 3 33 is complete the same discussion applies to germs f defined on c w where c is any finite dimensional partial quadrant in rn leading to the following theorem from 21 theorem 2 7 theorem 3 35 let c be a finite dimensional partial quadrant in rn if f o c w 0 w 0 is a sc 0 contraction germ which is in addition of class sck then the solution germ o c 0 w 0 satisfying f graph 0 is also of class sck in particular if f is a sc smooth germ so is its solution germ remark 3 36 for later use we reformulate corollary 3 34 in quantitative terms if f is a sc 0 contraction germ which in addition is a sc smooth germ satisfying f 0 0 then the solution germ possesses the following properties of existence uniqueness and regularity there exist monotone decreasing sequences i for i 0 and i for i 0 such that 1 a 0 k rn k a 0 0 w w w 0 0 is a continuous solution of f a a 0 satisfying 0 0 2 if the solution f a w 0 satisfies a 0 0 and w 0 0 then w a 3 if a 0 i then a wi and a i i for every i 0 4 the germ a 0 k rn k a 0 i wi is of class ci for every i 0 89 3 4 stability of basic germs all the maps considered in the section are sc smooth maps let us recall from definition 3 7 the notion of a basic germ definition 3 37 the basic class cbasic let w be a sc banach space a basic germ f o 0 k rn k w 0 rn w 0 is a sc smooth germ having the property that the germ p f is a sc 0 contraction germ where p rn w w is the sc projection we denote the class of all basic germs by cbasic in view of definition 3 11 the basic germs are the local models for the germs of sc fredholm sections theorem 3 38 weak stability of basic germs we consider a basic germ f o 0 k rn k w 0 rn w 0 which we can view as the principal part of a sc smooth section of the obvi ous strong bundle we assume that s is the principal part of a sc section of the same bundle satisfying s 0 0 then there exists a strong bundle isomorphism u rn w u rn w where u is an open neighborhood of 0 in 0 k rn k w and u is an open neighborhood of 0 in 0 k rn k w covering the sc diffeomorphism u 0 v 0 so that f s 1 is a basic germ here f s 1 is the germ f s v 1 rn w 1 where the levels are raised by 1 recalling the fredholm index of a basic germ in proposition 3 10 we conclude that n n n n because the fredholm index is invariant under strong bundle isomorphisms the integer k is the degeneracy index k dc 0 of the point 0 which is in view of proposition 2 24 and corollary 2 32 preserved under the sc diffeomorphism satisfying 0 0 although theorem 3 38 was not explicitly formulated in 21 it follows from the proof of theorem 3 9 in 21 proof denoting by p rn w w the sc projection the composition p f is by definition of the form p f a w w b a w 90 and has the property that for every 0 the estimate b a w b a w m w w m holds if a w and w are sufficiently small on level m linearizing the sc section s with respect to the variable w w at the point 0 we introduce the sc operator a p d 2 s 0 w w since s is a sc section and 0 is smooth point the operator a w w is a sc operator therefore the operator 1 a w w is a sc perturbation of the identity and hence a sc fredholm operator by proposition 1 10 because a is level wise compact the index ind 1 a is equal to 0 the associated sc decompositions of the sc banach space w are the following 1 a w c x w r z where c ker 1 a and r range 1 a and dim c dim z since s is a sc section we conclude from proposition 1 18 that the re striction s um rn wm is of class c 1 for every m 1 from the identity p s a w p d 2 s 0 w p s a w p d 2 s 0 w one deduces the following representation for p s on every level m 1 p s a w aw s a w and d 2 s 0 0 0 therefore s is with respect to the second variable w a arbitrary small contraction on every level m 1 if a and w are sufficiently small depending on the level m and the contraction constant we can make the arguments which follow only on the levels m 1 this explains the reason for the index raise by 1 in the theorem we can write p f s a w w b a w aw s a w 1 a w b a w s a w 1 a w b a w where we have abbreviated b a w b a w s a w by assumption the map b belongs to the sc 0 contraction germ and hence the map b is a contraction in the second variable on every level m 1 with 91 arbitrary small contraction constant 0 if a and w are sufficiently small depending on the level m and the contraction constant introducing the canonical projections by p 1 w c x x p 2 w r z r we abbreviate a w p 2 p f s a w p 2 1 a w b a w p 2 1 a p 1 w b a w we have used the relation 1 a 1 p 1 0 the operator l 1 a x x r is a sc isomorphism in view of l 1 p 2 1 a p 1 w p 1 w we obtain the formula l 1 a w p 1 w l 1 p 2 b a w writing w 1 p 1 w p 1 w we shall consider a 1 p 1 w as our new finite parameter and correspondingly define the map b by b a 1 p 1 w p 1 w l 1 p 2 b a 1 p 1 w p 1 w since b a w is a contraction in the second variable on every level m 1 with arbitrary small contraction constant if a and w are sufficiently small depending on the level m and the contraction constant the right hand side of l 1 a 1 p 1 w p 1 w p 1 w b a 1 p 1 w p 1 w possesses the required contraction normal form with respect to the variable p 1 w on all levels m 1 again if a and w are small enough depending on m and the contraction constant it remains to prove that the above normal form is the result of an ad missible coordinate transformation of the perturbed section f s choos ing a linear isomorphism z c we define the fiber transformation rn w rn x c by a w a l 1 p 2 w 1 p 2 w 92 we shall view as a strong bundle map covering the sc diffeomorphism v w v c x defined by a w a 1 p 1 w p 1 w where v 0 k rn k with the canonical projection p rn c x x p a 1 p 1 w p 1 w p 1 w and the relation p 1 p 0 we obtain the desired formula p f s 1 a 1 p 1 w p 1 w p 1 w b a 1 p 1 w p 1 w the proof of theorem 3 38 is complete the theorem has the following corollary where we use the standard no tations denoting as usual by c a partial quadrant in a sc banach space e we also use a second sc banach space f corollary 3 39 we assume that the sc germ g o c 0 f 0 is equiv alent by a strong bundle isomorphism to the basic germ g and assume that s o c 0 f 0 is a sc germ then there exists a strong bundle map such that g s 1 is a basic germ proof by assumption there exist open neighborhoods u of 0 in c and v of 0 in 0 k rn k w and a sc diffeomorphism u 0 v 0 which is covered by a strong bundle isomorphism u f v rn w such that g is a basic germ h then t s defines a sc section satisfying t 0 0 clearly g s h t and applying theorem 3 38 we find a second strong bundle map such that h t 1 is a basic germ taking the composition we conclude that g s 1 is a basic germ this completes the proof of corollary 3 39 in order to illustrate the corollary we now consider the sc smooth germ h o c 0 f for which we know that there exists a sc germ s satisfying s 0 h 0 and assume that the germ h s around 0 is equivalent to the basic germ g h s we observe that h h 0 h s s h 0 where s h 0 is a sc section then t s h 0 is a sc section and g t is a perturbation by a sc section of a basic germ by the previous 93 corollary we find a strong bundle coordinate change such that g s 1 is a basic germ or in other words h h 0 1 is a basic germ note that for the implicit function theorem it does not matter whether we work with f or f 1 ore even f 501 it matters that our coordinate change is compatible with the original sc structure we also point out that a strong bundle coordinate change for h 1 is not the same as a strong bundle coordinate change for h followed by a subsequent raise of the index 3 5 geometry of basic germs in this section we shall study in detail sc smooth germs f o 0 k rn k w 0 rn w 0 40 around 0 of the form f h s 41 where h is a basic germ and s is a sc germ satisfying s 0 0 we already know from corollary 3 10 that df 0 rn w rn w is a sc fredholm operator of index inddf 0 n n in the following we abbreviate e rn w c 0 k rn k w and f rn w and by p rn w w the sc projection theorem 3 40 local regularity and compactness let u be a rel atively open neighborhood of 0 in c we assume that f u f is a sc smooth map satisfying f 0 0 and of the form f h s where h is a basic germ and s is a sc germ satisfying s 0 0 we denote by s a w u f a w 0 the solution set of f in u then there exists a nested sequence u o 0 o 1 o 2 of relatively open neighborhoods of 0 in c on level 0 such that for every m 0 the closure of s o m in c e 0 c 0 is contained in c em cm i e clc 0 s o m cm 94 theorem 3 40 says in particular that o m s cm for all m 0 therefore the regularity of solutions a w of the equation f a w 0 is the higher the closer to 0 they are on the level 0 moreover the solution set on level m sufficiently close to 0 on level 0 has a closure on level 0 which still belongs to level m moreover the solution set on level m sufficiently close to 0 on level 0 has a closure on level 0 which belongs to level m proof we construct the sets o m inductively by showing that there exists a decreasing sequence m m 0 of positive numbers such that the sets o m a w c a 0 m and w 0 m have the desired properties we begin with the construction of o 0 by definition of a basic germ the composition p h is of the form p h a w w b a w where b 0 0 0 and b is a contraction in w locally near 0 0 moreover s is a sc germ satisfying s 0 0 we choose 0 0 such that the closed set a w c a 0 0 w 0 0 in e 0 is contained in u and such that in addition 01 b a w b a w 0 1 4 w w 0 for all a w and w w 0 satisfying a 0 0 w 0 0 and w 0 0 using b 0 0 and s 0 0 we can choose 0 0 0 such that 02 b a 0 0 1 4 0 for all a 0 0 03 p s a w 0 1 4 0 for all a 0 0 and w 0 0 for these choices of the constants 0 and 0 we introduce the closed set 0 a z c a 0 0 z 0 0 4 and denote by b 0 0 w 0 the closed ball in w 0 centered at 0 and having radius 0 we define the map f 0 0 b 0 0 w 0 by f 0 a z w b a w z 95 if a z 0 and w w b 0 0 we estimate using 01 and 02 f 0 a z w 0 b a w z 0 b a w b a 0 0 b a 0 0 z 0 1 4 0 1 4 0 1 4 0 3 4 0 0 and f 0 a z w f 0 a z w 0 1 4 w w 0 hence f 0 a z b 0 0 b 0 0 is a contraction uniform in a z 0 therefore by the parametrized version of banach s fixed point theorem there exists a unique continuous function 0 0 b 0 0 solving the equation 0 a z b a 0 a z z for all a z 0 now we define the open neighborhood o 0 by o 0 a w c a 0 0 and w 0 0 clearly the set o 0 satisfies clc 0 s o 0 c 0 we observe that if a w o 0 then p s a w 0 0 4 by 03 so that 0 a p s a w is defined if in addition f a w 0 then p f a w 0 so that w b a w p s a w and we claim that w 0 a p s a w for all a w o 0 42 indeed since 0 a p s a w b a 0 a p s a w p s a w we estimate using 01 w 0 a p s a w 0 b a w b a 0 a p s a w 0 1 4 w 0 a p s a w 0 implying w 0 a p s a w as claimed we next construct the set o 1 o 0 since the embedding w 1 w 0 is continuous there is a constant c 1 0 such that 0 c 1 1 with the constant 0 defined above we choose 0 1 min 0 0 c 1 such that the following holds the set a w c a 0 1 and w 1 1 is contained in u and 11 b a w b a w 1 1 4 w w 1 96 for all a w w w 1 satisfying a 0 1 w 1 1 and w 1 1 we choose 0 1 1 such that 12 b a 0 1 1 4 1 for all a 0 1 13 p s a w 1 1 4 1 for all a 0 1 and w 0 1 proceeding as in the construction of o 0 we introduce the closed set 1 in e 1 by 1 a z c 1 a 0 1 z 1 1 4 and abbreviate by b 1 1 the closed ball in w 1 having its center at 0 and radius 1 we define the map f 1 1 b 1 1 w 1 by f 1 a z w b a w z by 11 and 13 the map f 1 1 b 1 1 b 1 1 is a contraction uniform in a z 1 again using the banach fixed point theorem we find a unique continuous map 1 1 b 1 1 solving the equation 1 a z b a 1 a z z for all a z 1 now we define the open neighborhood o 1 as o 1 a w c 0 a 0 1 w 0 1 by our definition of 1 we have 1 1 0 so that o 1 o 0 we next claim that 0 a p s a w 1 a p s a w for all a w o 1 43 to verify the claim we note that if a w o 1 then by 13 p s a w 1 1 4 hence 1 a p s a w is defined and its norm satisfies 1 a p s a w 1 1 because 1 takes its values in the ball b 1 1 this implies recalling that 0 c 1 1 and 1 0 c 1 the estimate 1 a p s a w 0 c 1 1 a p s a w 1 c 1 1 0 0 therefore by construction the map a w 7 1 a p s a w solves the equation 1 a p s a w b a 1 a p s a w p s a w for all a w o 1 on the other hand it follows from o 1 o 0 and 03 that p s a w 0 0 4 and hence the map a w 7 0 a p s a w solves by construction the same equation 0 a p s a w b a 0 a p s a w p s a w for all a w o 1 the claim 43 now follows from the uniqueness of the banach fixed point theorem on the level 0 97 if a w o 1 satisfies in addition f a w 0 we deduce from 42 and 43 that w 1 a p s a w w 1 for all a w o 1 44 in order to verify the desired property of o 1 we fix a w cl 0 s o 1 then there exists a sequence an wn s o 1 such that an wn a w on level 0 from 44 it follows that wn 1 an p s an wn w 1 for all n since s is sc we know that p s an wn p s a w on level 1 from the continuity of 1 we conclude the convergence wn 1 an p s an wn 1 a p s a w w on level 1 consequently a w c 1 as desired the induction step is now clear and the further details are left to the reader the previous result has a useful corollary corollary 3 41 we assume that u is a relatively open neighborhood of 0 in a partial quadrant c 0 n w in a sc banach space e rn w and let f rn w let f u f be a sc smooth map satisfying f 0 0 and admitting the decomposition f h s where h cbasic and s is a sc map satisfying s 0 0 we assume in addition that df 0 0 is surjective then there exists a relatively open neighborhood u u on level 0 such that the following holds 1 if a w u satisfies f a w 0 then a w is on level 1 2 if a w u and f a w 0 then df a w e f is a surjective fredholm operator of index n n proof in view of theorem 3 40 we know that if f a w 0 and a w is sufficiently close to 0 0 on level 0 then a w e 1 hence the linearization df a w is a well defined as a bounded linear operator from e 0 to f 0 by proposition 3 10 the linearization df 0 0 e f is a fredholm operator whose index is equal to inddf 0 n n by assumption the fredholm operator df 0 0 e f is surjective denoting by k its kernel we have the splitting e k n and conclude that the restriction df 0 n n f is an isomorphism of banach spaces and hence a fredholm operator of index 0 to see this we observe that df a w n df 0 0 n df a w n df 0 0 n 98 and the second term is a admissible perturbation which does not affect the fredholm character nor the index indeed df a w df 0 0 d 2 b a w c a w where c a w e f is a compact operator and d 2 b a w for every 0 if a w sufficiently small in e 0 depending on in view of lemma 3 9 it follows that df a w n n f is a fredholm operator of index 0 if a w e 1 is sufficiently small in e 0 we finally show that df a w n n f is a surjective operator if a w e 1 solves in addition f a w 0 since the index is equal to 0 the kernel of df a w n has the same dimension as the cokernel of df a w n in f hence we have to prove that the kernel of df a w n is equal to 0 if a w e is close to 0 0 in e 0 and solves f a w 0 arguing by contradiction we assume that there exist a sequence ak wk c e 1 satisfying f ak wk 0 and ak wk 0 0 as k moreover there exists a sequence k k rn w n satisfying k k 0 1 and df ak wk k k 0 consequently k d 2 b ak wk k d 1 b ak wk k pds ak wk k k 45 without loss of generality we may assume that k in view of the proof of the previous theorem for large values of k the sequence ak wk is bounded on level 2 consequently since the embedding w 2 w 1 is compact we may assume that ak wk 0 0 on level 1 therefore d 1 b ak wk k d 1 b 0 0 in e 0 in addition since s is a sc operator the map e 1 e 0 f 1 defined by x h 7 pds x h is continuous hence there exists 0 such that pds x h 1 1 if x 1 and h 0 this implies that there is a constant c 0 such that pds x h 1 c for all x 1 and h 0 1 from this estimate we conclude that the sequence pds ak wk k k is bounded in w 1 since the embedding w 1 w 0 is compact we may assume that the sequence pds ak wk k k converges to some point w 0 in w 0 denoting by zk the right hand side of 45 we have proved that zk z 0 d 1 b 0 0 w 0 in w 0 choosing 0 1 in lemma 3 9 the operators 1 d 2 b ak wk have a bounded inverse for large k and we obtain from 45 that k 1 d 2 b ak wk 1 zk l 0 d 2 b ak wk l zk 99 for large k we claim that the sequence k converges to z 0 in w 0 indeed take 0 from d 2 b ak wk for k large and the fact that the sequence zk is bounded in w 0 it follows that there exists l 0 such that l l 0 d 2 b ak wk l zk 0 2 hence k z 0 0 zk z 0 0 l 0 l 1 d 2 b ak wk l zk 0 l l 0 d 2 b ak wk l zk 0 zk z 0 0 l 0 l 1 d 2 b ak wk l zk 0 2 from zk z 0 0 0 and d 2 b ak wk zk d 2 b 0 0 z 0 0 it follows that lim supk k z 0 0 2 and since was arbitrary that k z 0 in w 0 we have proved that k k z 0 in e 0 hence z 0 n and z 0 0 1 on the other hand 0 lim k df ak wk k k df 0 z 0 since df 0 0 n is an isomorphism z 0 0 0 in contradiction to z 0 0 1 the proof of corollary 3 41 is complete in the following theorem we denote as usual by c the partial quadrant 0 k rn k w in the sc banach space e rn w and by u a relatively open neighborhood of 0 in c moreover f is another sc banach space of the form f rn w we consider a sc smooth germ f u f satisfying f 0 0 of the form f h s where h is a basic germ and s is a sc germ satisfying s 0 0 by theorem 3 38 there exists a strong bundle isomorphism u rn w u rn w where u is a relatively open neighborhood of 0 in the partial quadrant c 0 k rn k w covering the sc diffeomorphism u 0 u 0 such that the section g f 1 has the property that g 1 h 100 s 1 u 1 rn w 1 is a basic germ clearly x u f x 0 x u g x 0 we abbreviate f rn w and denote by p the sc projection p rn w w by definition of a basic germ the composition p g 1 is a sc 0 contraction germ which is sc smooth therefore in view of remark 3 36 applied to the levels m 1 there are monotone decreasing sequences i for i 1 and i for i i such that abbreviating by bi i the closed ball w i of center 0 and radius i and by u i the neighborhood u i a 0 k rn k a 0 i the following statements 1 4 hold 1 there exists a unique continuous map u 1 b 1 1 satisfying p g a a 0 and 0 0 2 if a w u 1 b 1 1 solves the equation p g a w 0 then w a 3 if a u i then a w i and a i i for every i 1 4 u i w i is of class ci 1 for all i 1 lemma 3 42 there exists 0 and 0 having the following properties if a w solves the equation g a w 0 and satisfies a 0 0 and w 0 0 then w a moreover if a 0 0 then a 0 0 proof the solutions of f a 0 and g x 0 are related by the sc diffeomorphism via x x applying the proof of theorem 3 40 to the sc germ f h s we find for every 0 a constant 0 such that if x c is a solution of f x 0 satisfying x 1 then x 1 using the continuity of on the level 1 we choose now 0 such that if x 1 then x x a w satisfies a 0 1 and w 1 1 then we conclude from x 0 that x 1 using the continuity of 1 on level 0 we next choose the desired constants 0 and 0 such that the estimates a 0 0 and w 0 0 imply that x 1 a w satisfies x 0 assuming now that x a w is a solution of g a w 0 satisfying a 0 0 and w 0 0 we conclude that 1 x 0 it follows that 1 x 1 which implies a 0 1 and w 1 1 from property 2 we conclude that w a proving the first statement of the lemma using that the embedding w 1 w 0 is continuous we find a constant c 0 such that a 0 c a 1 taking 0 and 0 smaller we can achieve that a 0 0 if a 0 0 and the proof of the lemma is complete 101 theorem 3 43 local germ solvability i let f u f be a sc smooth germ satisfying f 0 0 and of the form f h s where h is a basic germ and s is a sc section satisfying s 0 0 we assume that the linearization df 0 e f is surjective and the kernel k kerdf 0 is in good position to the partial quadrant c let u rn w u rn w be the strong bundle isomorphism covering the sc diffeomorphism u 0 u 0 guaranteed by theorem 3 38 here u is a relatively open neighborhood of 0 in the partial quadrant c 0 k rn k w sitting in the sc banach space e rn w then denoting by g f the push forward section the following holds the kernel k kerdg 0 t 0 k is in good position to the partial quadrant c and there is a good complement y of k in e k y and a c 1 map v y 1 defined on the relatively open neighborhood v of 0 in k c such that 1 o k c 0 y 0 is a sc smooth germ 2 0 0 and d 0 0 3 after perhaps suitably shrinking u it holds x u f x 0 x u g x 0 y y y v proof the linearization dg 0 rn w rn w is a surjective map because by assumption df 0 rn w rn w is surjective moreover kerdg 0 t 0 kerdf 0 in view of proposition 2 24 and corollary 2 32 we also have t 0 c c we also recall that above lemma 3 42 we have introduced the sc projection p rn w w the neighborhood u i a 0 k rn k a 0 i of 0 in rn and the map u i w i satisfying p g a a 0 and a 0 we introduce the map h u 1 rn by h a 1 p g a a it satisfies h 0 0 since g 0 0 in the following we need the map h to be of class c 1 in view of property 4 the map h restricted to u i is of class 102 ci 1 since by proposition 1 18 the sc smooth map g induces a c 1 map g em 1 em for every m 0 we shall restrict the domain of h to the set u 3 in order to prove the theorem we shall first relate the solution set h 0 to the solution set g 0 and start with the following lemma lemma 3 44 the linear map 7 d 0 from rn into e induces a linear isomorphism k kerdh 0 kerdg 0 k proof of the lemma we first claim that kerdg 0 d 0 kerdh 0 indeed if kerdg 0 then p dg 0 0 and 1 p dg 0 0 by assumption p g a w w b a w hence differ entiating at the point 0 in the direction of and recalling from lemma 3 9 that d 2 b 0 0 we obtain 0 p dg 0 d 1 b 0 d 2 b 0 d 1 b 0 on the other hand differentiating the identity p g a a 0 at a 0 and evaluating the derivative at we find in view of previous equation 0 p g 0 d 0 d 0 d 1 b 0 consequently d 0 as claimed from dh 0 1 p dg 0 d 0 it follows if kerdh 0 in view of p dg 0 d 0 0 for all that d 0 kerdg 0 conversely if kerdg 0 then 0 p dg 0 d 1 b 0 and 1 p dg 0 0 since p dg 0 d 0 0 we conclude that d 0 and hence 1 p dg 0 d 0 dh 0 0 so that kerdh 0 the proof of lemma 3 44 is complete by assumption the kernel k kerdf 0 is in good position to the partial quadrant c we recall that this requires that k c has a nonempty interior in k and there exists a complement of k denoted by k so that 103 k k e having the following property there exists 0 such that if k k k k satisfies k 0 k 0 then k k c if and only if k c 46 the kernel k kerdg 0 t 0 k has a complement in e denoted by k t 0 k so that k k e lemma 3 45 the complement k is a good complement of k in e proof since t 0 rn w rn w is a topological isomorphism and t 0 c c and k t 0 k it follows that k c has a nonempty interior in k next we choose 0 satisfying t 0 t 0 1 and take x k and y k satisfying y 0 x 0 if x t 0 1 x and y t 0 1 y then y 0 t 0 1 y 0 t 0 1 y 0 t 0 1 x 0 t 0 1 t 0 0 t 0 1 t 0 x 0 x 0 by 46 x y c if and only if x c and since t 0 c c we conclude that x y c if and only if x c the next lemma is proved in appendix 3 8 2 lemma 3 46 the kernel k kerdh 0 rn of the linearization dh 0 is in good position to the partial quadrant c 0 k rn k in rn more over there exists a good complement z of k in rn hence k z rn having the property that z w is a good complement of k kerdg 0 in e e k z w in view of lemma 3 46 theorem 3 78 in appendix 3 8 5 is applicable to the c 1 map h u 2 rn where u 2 a 0 k rn k a 0 2 rn is introduced before the statement of theorem 3 43 according to theorem 3 78 there exists a relatively open neighborhood v of 0 in k c and a c 1 map v z satisfying 0 0 and d 0 0 and solving the equation h a a 0 for all a v 104 z c rn k h 0 v figure 5 the situation is illustrated in the following figure since h is the more regular the closer we are to 0 the map has the same property recalling the solution germ u 1 rn b 1 w 1 of g a a 0 we define the map v z w 1 by a a a a v v by the properties of and there exists a nested sequence v 1 v 2 of relatively open neighborhoods of 0 in k c such that the restriction v i v i z w i is of class ci for every i 1 recalling from lemma 3 44 that k kerdg 0 v d 0 v v k we denote by k k the projection v d 0 v 7 v the map is a sc isomorphism we next introduce the map from a relatively open neighborhood of 0 in k c into z w by y d 0 y y y k c 105 it satisfies 0 0 differentiating at y 0 and using d 0 0 we obtain d 0 d 0 d 0 0 for all k and hence d 0 0 recalling that y v d 0 v where v kerdh 0 and y v we compute y y v d 0 v d 0 v v v v v v v v where v v rn hence by definition of the solution germ we conclude from lemma 3 42 that g y y 0 for all y k c near 0 on level 0 by construction the map is a sc smooth germ satisfying 0 0 and d 0 0 and there exists a nested sequence of relatively open subsets o i 1 vi of 0 in k where oi a 0 k rn k a 0 i such that the restrictions satisfy o i ci o i z w i for i 1 moreover if g y w 0 for y k c and w z w sufficiently small on level 0 then w y to sum up there exists a relatively open subset u of 0 in c diffeomorphic to the relatively open subset u u of 0 in c and a relatively open subset v of 0 in k c such that x u f x 0 x u g x 0 y y y v the proof of theorem 3 43 is finished corollary 3 47 let f u f be a sc smooth germ satisfying f 0 0 and of the form f h s where h is a basic germ and s is a sc section satisfying s 0 0 we assume that the linearization df 0 e f is surjective and the kernel k kerdf 0 is in good position to the partial quadrant c e then there exists a good complement y of k in e so that k y e and there exists a c 1 map v y 1 defined on relatively open neighborhood v of 0 in k c having the following properties 1 o k c 0 y 0 is a sc smooth germ 106 2 0 0 and d 0 0 3 x u f x 0 v v v v after perhaps replacing u by a smaller open neighborhood proof in view of theorem 3 43 the sc diffeomorphism u 0 u 0 between relatively open subsets u and u of the partial quadrants c 0 k rn k w and c 0 k rn k w satisfies t 0 k k kerdg 0 and k is in good position to c if y is the good sc complement in theorem 3 43 of k in e we define y t 0 1 y then y is the desired good complemement of k in e with respect to the partial quadrant c so that e k y let k y k be the sc projection recalling the map v k c y 1 from theorem 3 43 we define the map v k c k by v 1 v v the map satisfies 0 0 and its derivative d 0 k k is equal to d 0 t 0 1 k hence it is an isomorphism we claim that the map preserves the degeneracy index that is dk c v dk c v 47 for v v close to 0 to see this we first assume that v v k c belongs to k rn k w where rn k w is identified with 0 k rn k w hence v is of the form v 0 w 0 k rn k w if k is one dimensional then in view of lemma 3 68 v t a w rk rn k w where a a 1 ak satisfies aj 0 consequently t 0 so that v 0 since 0 0 we have dc k 0 dc k 0 if dimk 2 then denoting by k the algebraic complement of k rn k w in k we may assume after linear change of coordinates that the following holds a the finite dimensional subspace k is spanned by the vectors e j a j b j w j for 1 j m dim k in which a j are the vectors of the standard basis of rl b j b j m 1 b j k with b j i 0 and w j rn k w b the good complement y of k in e rn w is contained in 0 l rk l rn k w 107 by adding a basis e j 0 w j 0 k rn k w m 1 j dimk of k rn k w we obtain a basis of k we have a similar statement for the subspace k with the algebraic com plement k of k rn k w in k e j replaced by ej and the good com plement y of k contained in 0 m rk m rn k w now if v 0 w 1 0 k rn k w then in view of a dk c v m dim k recalling k is in good position to the partial quadrant c and y is a good complement of k in e there exists a constant such that if n k and y y then y 0 n 0 implies that n y c if and only if n c it follows from 0 0 and d 0 0 that v 0 v 0 and since v c we conclude that v v c since for v as above vj 0 for all 1 j k we find that also j v 0 for all 1 j k hence v v 0 w 2 0 k rn k w because the map is a sc diffeomorphism 1 v v 1 0 w 2 0 w 0 k rn k w we shall show that 0 w k c and that dk c 0 w m we decompose 0 w according to the direct sum e k y as 0 w k y where k k and y y and write k 1 k w 1 rk rn k w y y 1 yk w 2 y then using y 0 m rk m rn k w we find that y 1 ym 0 this implies that also 1 m 0 consequently 0 w k 0 w 1 k c and dk c 0 w m we have proved the identity 47 in the case v k rn k w in the case v a w k c k rn k w we use lemma 3 70 and compute dc k v dc 1 v v dc v v dc k v hence v c is a c 1 map satisfying 0 0 d 0 k c k c and preserving the degeneracy index consequently applying the inverse function theorem for partial quadrants in rn theorem 3 72 to the map d 0 1 we find relatively open neighborhoods v 0 v and v 1 c of 0 such that v 0 v 1 is a c 1 diffeomorphism which has higher and higher differentiability closer and closer to 0 considering the map w 7 1 1 w 1 w w v 1 we obtain 1 1 w 1 w w and define the map v 1 y 108 by w 1 1 w 1 w w 1 1 1 w 1 w finally we can now choose open neighborhoods v k c of 0 and u of 0 in c appropriately and see that the map has the desired properties 1 3 of corollary 3 47 3 6 implicit function theorems let us recall from definition 3 4 the concept of a filled version definition 3 48 filling we consider a tame strong local bundle k o where k r u f and let the set u c e be a relatively open neighborhood of 0 in the partial quadrant c of the sc banach space e here f is a sc banach space and r is a strong bundle retraction of the form r u h r u u h covering the tame retraction r u u onto o r u we assume that r 0 0 a sc smooth section germ f 0 of the bundle k o possesses a filling if there exists a sc smooth section germ g 0 of the bundle u f u satisfying the following properties 1 f x g x for x o close to 0 2 if g y r y g y for a point y u near 0 then y o 3 the linearisation of the map y 7 1 r y g y at the point 0 restricted to ker dr 0 defines a topological linear isomorphism ker dr 0 ker 0 remark 3 49 by replacing o by a smaller set we may assume in 1 that f x g x for all x o and in 2 that g y r y g y for y u implies that y o 109 we also recall the notions sc fredholm germ and sc fredholm section definition 3 50 sc fredholm germ let f be a sc smooth section of the tame strong bundle p y x and let x x be a smooth point then f x is a sc fredholm germ if there exists a strong bundle chart around x as defined in definition 2 50 1 v k covering v x o 0 where k o is a tame strong local bundle containing 0 o u such that the local section germ f 1 o k has a filling g u u f near 0 which possesses the following additional property there exists a local sc section s u u f satisfying s 0 g 0 such that g s is conjugated near 0 to a basic germ definition 3 51 sc fredholm section a sc smooth section f of the tame strong bundle p y x is a sc fredholm section if 1 f is regularizing i e if x xm and f x ym m 1 then x xm 1 2 the germ f x is a sc fredholm germ at every smooth point x x from theorem 3 15 we know that sc fredholm sections are stable under sc perturbations if f is a sc fredholm section then f s is also a sc fredholm section for every sc section s proposition 3 52 if f is a sc fredholm section of the tame strong bundle p y x and x is a solution of f x 0 then tf x txx yx is a sc fredholm operator proof since f x is a sc fredholm germ there exists a tame strong bundle chart 1 v k around x such that the section f f 1 o k has a filling g u u f for which there exists a sc section s u u f satisfying s 0 g 0 such that g s is conjugated near 0 to a basic germ hence by proposition 3 10 the linearization d g s 0 e f is a sc fredholm operator since ds 0 is a sc operator the linearization dg 0 is sc fredholm operator in view of proposition 1 10 from proposition 3 5 2 about fillers it follows that t f 0 t 0 o k 0 is a sc fredholm operator of index ind t f 0 ind dg 0 ind d g s 0 and the proposition follows 110 we now focus on the solution set f 0 of a sc fredholm section near a point x x of f x 0 in the case of a boundary i e dx x 1 we require that ker f x is in good position to the partial cone cxx in the tangent space txx as defined in definition 2 27 definition 3 53 good position of a sc fredholm germ a sc fredholm germ f x of a tame strong bundle y x satisfying f x 0 is in good position if 1 f x txx yx is surjective 2 if dx x 1 then ker f x txx is in good position to the partial cone cxx in the tangent space txx the fundamental implicit function theorem is as follows theorem 3 54 let f be a sc fredholm section of a tame strong bundle y x if f x 0 and if the sc fredholm germ f x is in good position then there exists an open neighborhood v of x x such that the solution set s y v f y 0 in v has the following properties 1 at every point y s the sc fredholm germ f y is in good position 2 s is a sub m polyfold of x and the induced m polyfold structure is equivalent to a smooth manifold structure with boundary with corners in case x the requirement that f x is in good position just means that f x is surjective in this case the local solution set s is a smooth manifold and the linearization f y is surjective at every point y s we note that theorem 3 19 and theorem 3 23 are immediate conse quences of theorem 3 54 proof of theorem 3 54 the sc smooth sc fredhom section f of the tame strong bundle p y x over the m polyfold x is regularizing so that the solutions y x of f y 0 are smooth points moreover at every smooth point y x the sc germ f y is a sc fredholm germ we now focus on a neighborhood of the solution x of f x 0 by assumption the sc fredholm germ f x is in good position according to definition 3 53 so that the kernel n ker f x is in good position to the partial cone cxx txx as defined in definition 2 38 and the linearization 111 f x txx yx is surjective in view of proposition 3 52 the linear oper ator f x is a fredholm operator its index is equal to ind f x dimn by definition of a sc fredholm germ there exists a strong bundle chart v p 1 v k u f of the tame strong bundle p y x p 1 v k p y yp v o covering the sc diffeomorphism v o which is defined on the open neighborhood v x of the given point x x and satisfies x 0 the retract k r u f is the image of the strong bundle retraction r u f u f of the form r u h r u u h and which covers the tame sc smooth retraction r u u onto o r u as usual the set u c is a relatively open subset of the partial quadrant c 0 k rn k w in the sc banach space e rn w still by definition of a sc fredholm germ the push forward section f f o k possesses a filled version g u u f it has in particular the property that g u f u if u o 48 in addition there exists a strong bundle isomorphism u f u f y y u u where f rn w it covers the sc diffeomorphism u u satisfying 0 0 the set u is a relatively open subset of the partial quadrant c t 0 c in the sc space e rn w in addition by definition of a sc fredholm germ there exists a sc section s u u f satisfying s 0 g 0 such that the push forward section g s h u f 112 is a basic germ according to definition 3 7 therefore g h t 49 where t s is a sc section u f in view of proposition 3 10 the linearization d h t 0 e f is a sc fredholm operator so that by proposition 1 10 the operator dg 0 e f is also a sc fredholm operator from the postulated surjectivity of the linearization f x txx yx we deduce that t f 0 t 0 o k 0 is surjective hence by proposition 3 5 the operator dg 0 is surjective since ker f x is in good position to the partial cone cxx txx and since t x cxx c 0 o t 0 o c the kernel kert f 0 is in good position to the partial cone c 0 o the retract o r u is by assumption tame hence the tangent space t 0 o has in view proposition 2 35 the sc complement kerdr 0 in e so that e t 0 o kerdr 0 and kerdr 0 ex at the point x 0 ex is defined in definition 2 33 if z t 0 o is a good complement of kert f 0 in t 0 o kert f 0 z the space z kerdr 0 is a good complement of kert f 0 in e so that e kert f 0 z kerdr 0 since by the properties of the filler kert f 0 0 kerdg 0 we conclude that kerdg 0 is in good position to c in e therefore n kerd h t 0 is in good position to c t 0 c in e let now y e be the good complement of n in e n y from theorem 3 47 then we can apply theorem 3 47 about the local germ solvability and find an open neighborhood v n c of 0 and a map v y 1 possessing the following properties 1 v y 1 is of class c 1 and satisfies 0 0 and d 0 0 2 o n c 0 y 0 is a sc smooth germ 113 3 y v f y 0 u o f u 0 u o g u 0 by 48 u u h t u 0 by 49 v v v v by corollary 3 47 moreover 4 for every y v satisfying f y 0 so that y v v the kernel ker f y is in good position to the partial cone cyx tyx and f y tyx yy is surjective property 4 follows from corollary 3 41 and from the following lemma whose proof is postponed to appendix 3 8 3 lemma 3 55 let c e be a partial quadrant in the sc banach space e and n e a finite dimensional smooth subspace in good position to c and let y be a good complement of n in e so that e n y we assume that v n c is a relatively open neighborhood of 0 and v y 1 a map of class c 1 satisfying 0 0 and d 0 0 then there exists a relatively open neighborhood v v of 0 such that the following holds 1 v v c 1 for v v 2 for every v v the linear subspace nv n d v n n n has the banach space y y 0 as a topological complement 3 for every v v there exists a constant v 0 such that if n nv and y y satisfy y 0 v n 0 the statements n cz and n y cz are equivalent where z v v 114 so far we are confronted with the following situation the open neighbor hood v x of the smooth point x is a m polyfold and we denote the solution set of the sc fredholm section f of the tame strong bundle p 1 v v by s y v f y 0 it consists of smooth points for every y s the germ f y is a sc fredholm germ and the linearization f y tyv yy is a surjective fredholm operator whose kernel ker f y is in good position to the partial cone cyv tyv so that proceeding as above we can construct a map satisfying the above properties 1 3 consequently abbreviat ing d dim ker f x the solution set s v possesses the d dimensional tangent germ property according to definition 3 25 therefore we can apply theorem 3 27 to conclude that the solution set s y v f y 0 is a sub m polyfold whose induced m polyfold structure is equivalent to the structure of a smooth manifold with boundary with corners this completes the proof of theorem 3 54 finally we note two immediate consequences of theorem 3 54 theorem 3 56 global implicit function theorem in the case x if p y x is a tame strong bundle over an m polyfold x satisfying x and if f a sc fredholm section having the property that at ev ery point x in the solution set s y x f y 0 the linearization f x txx yx is surjective then s is a sub m polyfold of x and the induced m polyfold structure on s is equivalent to the structure of a smooth manifold without boundary in a later section we shall study the question how to perturb a sc fredholm section to guarantee the properties required in the hypotheses of theorem 3 56 and the following boundary version theorem 3 57 global implicit function theorem boundary case let p y x be a tame strong bundle and f a sc fredholm section having the property that at every point x in the solution set s y x f y 0 the linearization f x txx yx is surjective and the kerenel ker f x is in good position to the partial cone cxx txx then s is a sub m polyfold of x and the induced m polyfold structure on s is equivalent to the structure of a smooth manifold with boundary with corners 115 3 7 conjugation to a basic germ a useful criterion to decide in practice whether a filled version is conjugated to a basic germ is given in theorem 3 58 below we would like to point out a similar result due to k wehrheim in 42 the following criterion was introduced in 27 and employed to show that the nonlinear cauchy riemann operator occurring in the gromov witten theory defines a sc fredholm sec tion theorem 3 58 basic germ criterion let u be a relatively open neigh borhood of 0 in the partial quadrant c of the sc banach space e and let f u f be a sc smooth map into the sc banach space f which satisfies the following conditions 1 at every smooth point x u the linerarization df x e f is a sc fredholm operator and the index does not depend on x 2 there is a sc splitting e b x in which b is a finite dimensional subspace of e containing the kernel of df 0 and x c such that the following holds for b b u small enough if bj b u is a sequence converging to b and if j x is a sequence which is bounded on level m and satisfying df bj j yj zj where yj 0 in fm and where the sequence zj is bounded in fm 1 then the sequence j possesses a convergent subsequence in xm 3 for every m 0 and 0 the estimate d 2 f b 0 d 2 f b x h m h m holds for all h em and for b b sufficiently small and for x xm 1 sufficiently small on level m then the section f s is conjugated near 0 to a basic germ where s is the constant sc section s x f 0 proof abbreviating y df 0 x f the restriction df 0 x x y 116 is an injective and surjective sc operator since df 0 e f is a sc fredholm operator we find a finite dimensional sc complement a of y in f such that f y a denoting by p y a y the sc projection we consider the family b 7 l b of bounded linear operators defined by l b p df b x x y it is not assumed that the operators l b depend continuously on b since b is a finite dimensional sc smooth space the map b u x y b x 7 p df b x is sc smooth if we raise the index by one then the map b u x 1 y 1 b x 7 p df b x is also sc smooth by proposition 1 17 lemma 3 59 there exists a relatively open neighborhood o of 0 in b c such that the composition p df b x y has a trivial kernel for every b o proof assuming that such an open set o does not exist we find a sequence bj b c satisfying bj 0 and a sequence hj x 0 satisfying hj 0 1 such that p df bj hj 0 then df bj hj zj is a bounded sequence in a in fact on every level since a is a smooth subspace and we consider the level 1 for the moment from property 2 we deduce that hj has a convergent subsequence in x 0 so without loss of generality we may assume hj h in x 0 and h 0 1 hence p df 0 h 0 in contradiction to the injectivity of the map p df 0 x the lemma is proved 117 from the property 1 and the fact that p is a sc fredholm operator we conclude that p df x for smooth x are all sc fredholm operators having the same index in particular if b o then p df b x y is an injective sc fredholm operators of index 0 in view of lemma 3 59 and hence a sc isomorphisms next we sharpen this result lemma 3 60 we take a relatively open neighborhood o of 0 in c b whose compact closure is contained in o then for every level m there exists a number cm 0 such that for every b o we have the estimate p df b h m cm h m for all h xm proof arguing indirectly we find a levelm for which there is no such constant cm hence there are sequences bj o and hj xm satisfying hj m 1 and p df bj hj m 0 after perhaps taking a subsequence we may assume that bj b in o from df bj hj p df bj hj yj 0 in fm we conclude in view of the property 2 for a subsequence that hj h in xm by continuity p df b h 0 and h m 1 in contradiction to the fact that p df b x y is a sc isomorphism for b o so far we have verified that the family b 7 l b meets the assumptions of the following lemma taken from 25 proposition 4 8 lemma 3 61 we assume that v is a relatively open subset in the partial quadrant of a finite dimensional vector space g we suppose further that e and f are sc banach spaces and consider a family of linear operators v l v having the following properties i for every v v the linear operator l v e f is a sc isomorphism ii the map v e f v h 7 l v h is sc smooth iii for every level m there exists a constant cm 0 such that for v v and all h em l v h m cm h m 118 then the well defined map v f e v k 7 l v 1 k is sc smooth let us emphasize that it is not assumed that the operators v l v em fm depend continuously as operators on v in view of lemma 3 61 the map b y y b y 7 p df b x 1 y is sc smooth we may assume that the finite dimensional space b is equal to rn and that e rn x and c 0 k rn k x is the partial quadrant in e hence b c 0 k rn k moreover we may identify the finite dimensional subspace a of f with rn a replacing if necessary the relatively open neighborhood u c of 0 by a smaller one we may assume in addition that b x u implies that b o we now define a strong bundle map u rn y u rn y covering the identity u u by b x c y b x c p df b x 1 y we define the sc smooth germ h 0 by h b x f b x f 0 0 where b x f 0 0 is a constant sc section we shall show that the push forward germ k h is a basic germ using dh df we compute k b x 1 p h b x p dh b x 1 ph b x rn x the germ k is a sc smooth germ o 0 k rn k x 0 rn x 0 denoting by q rn x x the sc projection we shall verify that qk is a sc 0 contraction germ we define the sc smooth germ h rn x x by h b x x qk b x x p dh b x 1 ph b x 119 by construction h 0 0 0 the family l b x y of bounded linear operators defined by l b p df b x b b satisfies the assumptions of lemma 3 61 recalling now the condition 3 of theorem 3 58 we choose m 0 and 0 and accordingly take b b small and x x xm 1 small on level m then using the estimates in condition 3 and in lemma 3 61 we estimate recalling that p d 2 h b x p d 2 f b x h b x h b x m l b 1 l b x x ph b x ph b x m c 1 m p d 2 f b 0 x x h b x h b x m c 1 m 1 0 p d 2 f b 0 d 2 f b tx 1 t x x x dt m c 1 m dm x x m the map b x 7 h b x is sc smooth therefore using the density of xm 1 in xm we conclude for every m 0 and 0 that the estimate h b x h b x m x x m holds if b b is small enough and x x xm are sufficiently small having verified that the push forward germ k h is a basic germ the proof of theorem 3 58 is complete 3 8 appendix 3 8 1 proof of proposition 3 22 proposition 3 22 if n is a finite dimensional sc subspace in good po sition to the partial quadrant c in e then n c is a partial quadrant in n as a preparation for the proof we recall some tools and results from the appendix in 21 and begin with the geometry of closed convex cones and quadrants in finite dimensions a closed convex cone p in a finite dimensional vector space n is a closed convex subset satisfying p p 120 0 and r p p an extreme ray in a closed convex cone p is a subset r of the form r r x where x p 0 having the property that if y p and x y p then y r if the cone p has a nonempty interior then it generates the vector space n that is n p p a quadrant c in a vector space n of dimension n is a closed convex cone such that there exists a linear isomorphism t n rn mapping c onto 0 n we observe that a quadrant in n has precisely dim n many extreme rays the following version of the krein milman theorem is well known see exercise 30 on page 72 in 38 a proof can be found in the appendix of 21 lemma 6 3 lemma 3 62 a closed convex cone p in a finite dimensional vector space n is the closed convex hull of its extreme rays a closed convex cone p is called finitely generated provided p has finitely many extreme rays if this is the case then p is the convex hull of its finitely many extreme rays for example if c is a partial quadrant in the sc banach space e and n e is a finite dimensional subspace of e such that c n is a closed convex cone then c n is finitely generated lemma 3 63 let n be a finite dimensional vector space and p n a closed convex cone having a nonempty interior then p is a quadrant if and only if it has dim n many extreme rays the proof is given in 21 lemma 6 4 we consider the sc banach space e rn w containing the partial quadrant c 0 n w a point a c 0 n w rn w has the representation a a 1 an a where a 1 an 0 n and a w by a we shall denote the collection of all indices i 1 n for which ai 0 and denote by c a the complementary set of indices in 1 n correspondingly we introduce the following subspaces in rn r a x rn xj 0 for all j 6 a r c a x rn xj 0 for all j 6 ca the next lemma and its proof is taken from the appendix in 21 the hypothesis that c n is a closed convex cone is crucial 121 lemma 3 64 let n e be a finite dimensional smooth subspace of e rn w such that n c is a closed convex cone if a n c is a generator of an extreme ray r r x in n c then dim n 1 a if in addition n is in good position to c then dim n 1 a proof we assume r r a is an extreme ray in c n and abbreviate a and its complememnt in 1 n by c then r n c r c w let y c n r c w be a nonzero element since ai 0 for all i c there exists 0 so that a y n c r c w n c we conclude y r because r is an extreme ray given any element z n r c w we find 0 so that a z n c r c w and infer by the previous argument that a z r this implies that z r a hence dim n r c w 1 50 the projection p rn w r r c w r induces a linear map p n r 51 which by 50 has an one dimensional kernel therefore dim r dimr p dimn dim kerp dim n 1 next assume n is in good position to c hence there exist a constant c 0 and a sc complement n such that n n rn w and if n m n n satisfies m 0 c n 0 then n m c if and only if n c we claim that n r c w indeed let m be any element of n multiplying m by a real number we may assume m 0 c a 0 then a m c since a c this implies that mi 0 for all indices i a replacing m by m we conclude mi 0 for all i a so n r c w as claimed take k r a and write k 0 n m n n from n r c w we conclude p n k hence the map p in 51 is surjective and the desired result follows having studied the geometry of closed convex cones and partial quadrants in finite dimensions we shall next study finite dimensional subspaces n in 122 good position to a partial quadrant c in a sc banach space in this case n c can be a partial quadrant rather than a quadrant which requires some additional arguments we assume that n is a smooth finite dimensional subspace of e rn w which is in good position to the partial quadrant c 0 n w thus by definition there is a sc complement denoted by n of n in e and a constant c 0 such that if n m n n satisfies m 0 c n 0 then the statements n c and n m c are equivalent we introduce the subset if 1 n by a c n a 6 0 a 1 n and denote by c the complement 1 n the associated subspaces of rn are defined by r x rn xj 0 for j 6 and r c x rn xj 0 for j 6 c lemma 3 65 n r c w proof take m n we have to show that mi 0 for all i so fix an index i and let a be a nonzero element of c n such that i a multiplying a by a suitable positive number we may assume m 0 c a 0 since a c we infer that a m c this implies that ai mi 0 by definition of a we have ai 0 implying mi 0 replacing m by m we find mi 0 hence n r c w as claimed identifying w with 0 w we take an algebraic complement n of n w in n so that n n n w and e n n w n 52 let us note that the projection rn w rn restricted to n is injective so that dim n dim n 53 lemma 3 66 if the subspace n of e is in good position to the partial quadrant c then n is also in good position to c and the subspace n n w n is a good complement of n in e proof we define x x 0 since n is in good position to the quadrant c in e there exist a constant c 0 and a sc complement n of n in e such that if n m n n satisfies m c n then the statements 123 n c and n m c are equivalent since e is a banach space and n is a finite dimensional subspace of e there is a constant c 1 0 such that n m c 1 n m for all n m n n to prove that n is in good position to c we shall show that n n w n is a good complement of n in e let n m n n e and assume that m c 1 c n write m n 1 n 2 n w n since c 1 n 1 n 2 n 1 n 2 m c 1 c n we get n 2 c n note that n m n n 1 n 2 c if and only if n n 2 c since n 1 0 w since n 2 c n this is equivalent to n c it remains to show that n c has a nonempty interior by assumption n c has nonempty interior hence there is a point n n c and r 0 such that the ball bnr n in n is contained in n c write n n w where n n and w n w since n c and w w we conclude that n c hence n n c take bn r n the open ball in n centered at n and of radius r 0 we want to prove that c since c 0 n w rn w we have to prove for rn w that 0 n we estimate w n w n w n r so that w bnr n and hence w n c having identified w with 0 w we have w 0 w rn w consequently w w n c implies 0 n since also n one concludes that n c and that n belongs to the interior of n c in n the proof of lemma 3 66 is complete since by lemma 3 65 n r c w the good complement n n w n satisfies n r c w we claim that c n is a closed convex cone it suffices to verify that if a c n and a c n then a 0 we write a a a where a rn and a w then a a 0 n implies that a 0 so that a 0 a 0 w since a n and n is an algebraic complement of n w in n we conclude that a 0 moreover by lemma 3 66 n is in good position to c hence recalling lemma 3 64 we have proved the following result lemma 3 67 the intersection c n is a closed convex cone in n if a is a generator of an extreme ray in c n then dim n 1 a dc a 54 124 the position of n with respect to r c w is described in the next lemma lemma 3 68 either n r c w 0 or n r c w in the second case dim n 1 and proof assume that n r c w 6 0 take a nonzero point x n r c w we know that n c has a nonempty interior in n and is therefore generated as the convex hull of its extreme rays by lemma 3 62 let a c n be a generator of an extreme ray r then ai 0 for all i c and hence a x c n for large 0 taking another large number 0 we get a a x c n since r r a is an extreme ray we conclude a x r a so that x r a consequently there is only one extreme ray in n c namely r r a with a r c w since n c has a nonempty interior in n we conclude that dim n 1 hence n r a and n r c w from equation 54 we also conclude that ai 0 for all 1 i n this in turn implies that since a r c w the proof of lemma 3 68 is complete we finally come to the proof of proposition 3 22 proof of proposition 3 22 we consider according to lemma 3 68 two cases starting with the first case we assume that n r c w 0 the projection p n n r r c w r induces the linear map p n r 55 take k r and write k 0 n m n n since n r c w we conclude that p n m p n k so that p is surjective if n n and p n 0 then n n r c w 0 by assumption hence the map in 55 is a bijection by lemma 3 63 c n is a quadrant in n we shall show that p maps the quadrant c n onto the standard quadrant q 0 in r let a be a nonzero element in c n generating an extreme ray r r a then by lemma 3 64 dim n 1 a and since dim n there is exactly one index i for which ai 0 further ai 0 for all i c by definition of this implies that there can 125 be at most dim n many extreme rays indeed if a and a generate extreme rays and ai a i 0 for some i then ak a k 0 for all k i hence from aj 0 for all j c we conclude a a c for large 0 therefore a r a implying that a and a generate the same extreme ray as a consequence n c has precisely dim n many extreme rays because n c has a nonempty interior in view of lemma 3 66 hence the map p in 55 induces an isomorphism n n c r q this implies that n c n is isomorphic to rdim n 0 rdim n in the second case we assume that n r c w from lemma 3 68 and n r a for an element a c n satisfying ai 0 for all 1 i n hence n n c is isomorphic to r r and therefore n n c is isomorphic to r r since in this case n n the proof of proposition 3 22 is complete we would like to add two results which makes use of the previous dis cussion proposition 3 69 let n be a sc smooth finite dimensional subspace of e rn w in good position to the partial quadrant c 0 n w if x n c then 1 dn c x dc x if x 6 n w 2 dn c x dim n dim n w if x n w here we identify w with 0 n w proof we make use of the previous notations and distinguish the two case dimn 1 and dimn 1 if dimn 1 then n is spanned by a vector e a 1 an w rn w in which aj 0 for all 1 j n this implies that n n c is isomorphic to r 0 if x n c then x te for some t 0 if in addition x 6 n w then t 0 and hence dn c x 0 dc x if however x n w then t 0 implying that dn c x 1 dimn now we assume that dimn 1 and that n is the algebraic complement of n w in n so that n n n w we may assume after a linear change of coordinates that n is represented as follows 126 1 the linear subspace n is spanned by the vectors ej rn w for 1 j m dim n of the form ej aj bj wj rm rn m w where aj is the standard basis vector in rm bj bj 1 b j n m rn m satisfies b j i 0 for all 1 i n m and w j w if ej 0 wj 0 n w for m 1 j k k dimn is a basis of the finite dimensional subspace n w then the vectors e 1 ek form a basis of n n n w it follows that n n c is isomorphic to rk 0 m rk m now we assume that x n c if x n c then x m j 1 je j k j m 1 je j n n w 56 with j 0 for all 1 j m and dn c x 1 j m j 0 if in addition x n w then j 0 for all 1 j m and we conclude that dn c x m dimn dim n w if x n c n w then there is at least one index j 0 in 1 j 0 m for which j 0 0 this implies in view of 1 and 56 that x m j 1 ej x 1 xn w rn w satisfies xs 0 for all m 1 s n since b j i 0 for all 1 i n m and m 1 j n using that aj in 1 are vectors of the standard basis in rm it follows for 1 s m that xs 0 if and only if s 0 this shows that dn c x dc x if x 6 n w and completes the proof of proposition 3 69 lemma 3 70 let n be a sc smooth finite dimensional subspace of e rn w in good position to the partial quadrant c 0 n w whose good complement in e is y we assume that n c y 1 is a c 1 map satisfying 0 0 and d 0 0 then dn c v dc v v for all v n c n w close to 0 127 proof since n is in good position to c and y is a good complement of n is e there exists a constant exists a constant 0 such that if n n and y y satisfy y 0 n 0 then n c if and only if n y c it follows in view of 0 0 and d 0 0 that v 0 v 0 for v n c close to 0 now proceeding as in the proof of proposition 3 69 we distinguish the two cases dimn 1 and dimn 2 in the first case n is spanned by a vector e a w rn w in which a a 1 an satisfies aj 0 for all 1 j n take v n c n w then v t a w for t 0 so that dn c v 0 we already know that vj j v 0 for all 1 j n so to prove the lemma it suffices to show that vj j v 0 for 1 j n and v n c n w close to 0 arguing by contradiction we assume that there exists a sequence tk 0 such that if vk tka then v k i i v k 0 for some index 1 i n then 0 6 a a 0 vki vk 0 i v k vk 0 which leads to a contradiction since the right hand side converges to 0 in view of 0 0 and d 0 0 consequently dc v v 0 for all v n c n w which are close to 0 in the case dimn 2 we use the notation introduced in the proof of proposition 3 69 if v v 1 vk w n c n w then in view of 1 in the proof of proposition 3 69 dn c v 1 i k vi 0 and there exists at least one index 1 i k for which vi 0 this implies in particular that vj 0 for all k 1 j n moreover in view of lemma 3 65 the good complement y of n is contained in 0 m rn m w from this we conclude that vj j v vj for all 1 j m hence in order to finish the proof it suffices to show that vj j v 0 for all m 1 j n in order to verify this we introduce the sc linear map t n rk defined by t el el for 1 l k dimn where e 1 ek of rk then t n c c 0 m rk m and dn c v dc t v we consider the map g c rn w defined by g v t 1 v t 1 v for v v 1 v k c close to 0 since v v c g v c for v c close to 0 we prove our claim by showing that gj v 0 for m 1 j n 128 and nonzero v c close to 0 arguing by contradiction we assume that there exists a point v c different from 0 at which gj v 0 for some m 1 j n we have v i 0 for some 1 i m so that v tei c for t small then we compute d dt gj v tei t 0 bij d j v t 1 ei bij d j v e i since the map is of class c 1 and d 0 0 and bij 0 we conclude that the derivative is positive and hence the function t 7 gj v tei is strictly increasing for t small by assumption gj v 0 hence gj v tei 0 for t 0 small contradicting gj v tei 0 for t small consequently vj j v 0 for all m 1 j n and all v n c n w sufficiently close to 0 and since vj j v vj for 1 j m we conclude dn c v dc v v for v n c n w close to 0 the proof of lemma 3 70 is complete 3 8 2 proof of lemma 3 46 lemma 3 46 the kernel k kerdh 0 rn of the linearization dh 0 is in good position to the partial quadrant c 0 k rn k in rn moreover there exists a good complement z of k in rn so that k z rn having the property that z w is a good complement of k kerdg 0 in e e k z w proof the space e rn w is equipped with the norm 0 we use the equivalent norm defined by a w max a 0 w 0 for a w rn w the kernel k kerdg 0 rn w is in good position to the partial quadrant c 0 k rn k w and y is a good complement of k in e so that k y e we recall that by the definition of good position there exists 0 such that if k k and y y satisfy y k 57 129 then k y c if and only if k c 58 let y 0 be an algebraic complement of y w in y where we have identified w with 0 n w so that y y 0 y w we claim that the projection p rn w rn restricted to y 0 is injection indeed assume that x a w y 0 rn w satisfies that p x 0 then a 0 and x 0 w since x 0 w y w and y 0 y w 0 we conclude that x 0 so that indeed p y 0 is an injection introducing the subspace z p y 0 we claim that rn k z to verify the claim we take a rn and let x a 0 since rn w k y there are unique elements k k and y y such that x k y in view of lemma 3 44 the element k k is of the form k d 0 for a unique k the element y y is of the form y b w rn w hence x a 0 k y d 0 b w b d 0 w showing a b on the other hand since y y 0 y w we have b w b w 1 0 w 2 for w 1 w 2 w such that b w 1 y and 0 w 2 y w hence b p b w 1 z and therefore a b k z as claimed from this it follows that dimz n dim k and we choose a subspace z of z of dimension dimz n dim k so that rn k z recalling that the projection p y 0 z is an isomorphism we have p 1 z y we shall prove k is in good position to the partial quadrant c 0 k rn k in rn and z is a good complement of k so that k z rn in view of the fact that the map p 1 z y 0 is an isomorphism and z z there exists a constant a such that p 1 z a z for all z z 59 moreover by lemma 3 44 the map l k k defined by l d 0 is an isomorphism and hence there exists a constant b such that l d 0 b d 0 for all k 60 we choose 0 such that a b where 0 is the constant from the condition 57 we claim that if z z and k satisfy z 61 130 then z c if and only if c 62 since z z z there exists a unique w w such that p 1 z z w y 0 then we estimate using 59 61 and then 60 z w p 1 z a z a b d 0 d 0 thus z w y 0 y and d 0 k satisfy the estimate 57 and it follows that z w d 0 c if and only if d 0 c 63 since z w d 0 z w d 0 rn w 63 implies that z c if and only if c proving our claim 62 and we see that z is a good complement of k in rn next we set y z w and claim that k y rn w and that y is a good complement of k in e rn w we first verify that rn w k y take a w rn w then since rn w k y there are unique elements d 0 k where k and b w 1 y such that a w d 0 b w 1 k y 64 hence a b since rn k z we may decompose b as b 1 b 1 with 1 k and b 1 z and then 64 can be written as a w d 0 b w 1 d 0 1 b 1 w 1 d 0 1 d 0 1 b 1 w 1 d 0 1 1 d 0 1 b 1 w 1 d 0 1 where 1 d 0 1 k since 1 k and b 1 w d 0 1 z w y since b 1 z hence rn w k y as claimed if d 0 k y k z w then k z so that 0 and k y 0 and we have proved that z y rn w finally we shall show that y z w is a good complement of k in rn w recalling the isomorphism l k k l d 0 there exists a constant m such that l 1 m i e d 0 m for all k 131 we choose 0 such that m where is defined in 61 we shall show that if d 0 k and a w z satisfy the estimate a w d 0 65 then a w d 0 c if and only if d 0 c 66 since a w max a 0 w 0 a we conclude from 66 and 65 the estimate a a w d 0 m in view of 61 and 62 a c if and only if c this is equivalent to a w d 0 c if and only if d 0 c hence 66 holds and the proof that y z w is a good complement of k is complete the proof of lemma 3 46 is finished 3 8 3 proof of lemma 3 55 lemma 3 55 let c e be a partial quadrant in the sc banach space e and n e a finite dimensional smooth subspace in good position to c and let y be a good complement of n in e so that e n y we assume that v n c is a relatively open neighborhood of 0 and v y 1 a map of class c 1 satisfying 0 0 and d 0 0 then there exists a relatively open neighborhood v v of 0 such that the following holds 1 v v c 1 for v v 2 for every v v the banach space y y 0 is a topological complement of the linear subspace nv n d v n n n 3 for every v v there exists a constant v 0 such that if n nv and y y satisfy y 0 v n 0 then n cx if and only if n y cx are equivalent where x v v 132 proof of lemma 3 55 we shall use the notations of proposition 3 69 since the smooth finite dimensional subspace n of e is in good position to c and y is its good complement so that e n y there exists a constant 0 such that if n n and y y satisfy y 0 n 0 67 a then y n c if and only if n c 67 b 1 the c 1 map v y 1 satisfies 0 0 and d 0 0 so that lim v 0 v 0 v 0 0 consequently there exists a relatively open neighborhood v v of 0 in n such that v 0 v 0 for all v v since v v c we conclude from 67 b that v v c for all v v in addition since v consists of smooth points and v y 1 we have v v c 1 for all v v 2 by assumption e n y and d v n y for all n n if x n y n y e then y n d v n y d v n showing that e nv y if n d v n y n d v n y for some n n n and y y y then n n y y d v n n n y hence n n and y y showing that nv y 0 and hence e nv y that the subspace y is a topological complement of nv follows from the fact that nv is a finite dimensional subspace of e 3 without loss of generality we may assume e rn w and c 0 n w we recall that for x c the set cx is defined by cx a w rn w ai 0 for all 1 i n for which xi 0 and if xi 0 for all i n we set cx e clearly if x 0 w rn w then cx c if v 0 then x v v 0 so that cx c and the statement of the corollary follows from the fact that nv n and n is in good position to c having the good complement y in order to prove the statement for v 6 0 we distinguish thew two cases dimn 1 and dimn 1 in the first case the proof of lemma 3 70 shows 133 that vj j v 0 for all 1 j n this implies that cx e and that in view of 2 y is a good complement of nv with respect to cx in the second case dimn 1 and we denote by n the algebraic com plement of n w in n where w is identified with w 0 n w so that n n n w we may assume after a linear change of coordinates that the following holds a the linear subspace n is spanned by the vectors ej for 1 j m dim n of the form ej aj bj wj where aj are the vectors of the standard basis in rm bj bj 1 b j n m satisfy b j i 0 for all 1 i n m and wj w b the good complement y of n in e is contained in 0 m rn m w denoting by ej 0 wj 0 n w m 1 j k dimn a basis of n w the vectors e 1 ek form a basis of n we choose 0 2 where is the constant from 67 a and define the open neighborhood v of 0 in n c consisting of points v v satisfying d v n 0 n 0 for all n n we consider points v v belonging to n w where we identify w with 0 n w hence v is of the form v 0 w 0 n w then v 0 v 0 and since v c we conclude that v v and v v belong to the partial quadrant c this implies that i v 0 for all 1 i n and cx c where x v v 0 w we choose a positive constant v such that v 1 abbreviating h n d v n nv for some n n and taking y y we assume that y 0 0 h 0 v n d v n 0 68 we claim that y h cx if and only if h cx suppose that y h y n d v n cx c then we estimate using 68 y d v n 0 y 0 d v n 0 v h d v n d v n 0 v v n 0 n 0 69 since y d v n y and by assumption y h y d v n n cx c we deduce from 69 and 67 b that n c then the estimate d v n 0 n 0 n 0 and again 67 b imply that h n d v n c as claimed 134 conversely the assumption that h n d v n c implies in view of d v h 0 h 0 and 67 b that n c then using 69 we find hat y d v n h y h c we have proved that if h nv and y y satisfy y 0 v h 0 then y h cx if and only if h cx finally we consider points v v 1 vn w n c n w then vi 0 for some 1 i m and vj 0 for all m 1 j k moreover in view of the proof of the statement 1 u 0 v 0 which implies that v v c if v is close to 0 it follows from the proof of lemma 3 70 that vj j v 0 for all m 1 j n abbreviating x v v and denoting by x the set of indices 1 j n for which xj 0 we conclude cx a w rn w aj 0 for all 1 j m satisfying j 6 x recall that nv n d v n n n and e nv y in view of the statement 2 now the inclusion y 0 m rn m w and the definition of cx above show that if h n d v n nv and y y then y h cx if and only if h cx this completes the proof of lemma 3 55 3 8 4 diffeomorphisms between partial quadrants in rn in the sections 3 8 4 and 3 8 5 we shall prove an inverse function theorem and an implicit function theorem for smooth maps defined on partial quadrants in rn we recall that the closed subset c rn is a partial quadrant if there exists an isomorphism l of rn mapping c onto l c 0 k rn k for some k we begin with a definition definition 3 71 class c 1 let c be a partial quadrant in rn and f u rm a map defined on a relatively open subset u c the map f is said to be of class c 1 if for every x u there exists a bounded linear map df x rn rm such that lim x h u h 0 f x h f x df x h h 0 and in addition the map df u l rn rm x 7 df x is continuous 135 we note that the tangent tu u rn is a relatively open subset of the partial quadrant c rn and the map tf tu trm defined by tf x h f x df x h is continuous if the maps f and tf are of class c 1 then we say that f is of class c 2 inductively the map f is ck if the maps f and tf are of class ck 1 finally f is called smooth or c if f is of class ck for all k 1 we consider the following situation assume c is a partial quadrant in rn and u c a relatively open neighborhood of 0 in c let f u c be a smooth map such that f 0 0 and df 0 rn rn an isomorphism even if df 0 c c one cannot guarantee that the image f o of an open neighborhood o of 0 in c is an open neighborhood of 0 in c as figure 6 illustrates f o f o figure 6 the boundary tangents at 0 0 are the x and y axis but the domain in the right picture is not an open neighborhood of 0 0 our aim in this section is to derive an inverse and implicit function the orem in this context theorem 3 72 quadrant inverse function theorem we assume that c is a partial quadrant in rn and u c a relatively open neighborhood of 0 and consider a smooth map f u rn satisfying f u c and having the following properties 1 f 0 0 and df 0 c c 136 2 dc x dc f x for every x u then there exist two relatively open neighborhoods u and v of 0 in c such that u u and the map f u v is a diffeomorphism from rn c c and df 0 c c it follows that df 0 rn rn is an isomorphism therefore it suffices to study the map g u c defined by g x df 0 1 f x the map g has the same properties 1 and 2 but has the simplifying feature that dg 0 1 theorem 3 72 is a consequence of the following proposition proposition 3 73 we assume that c is a partial quadrant in rn and u c a relatively open convex neighborhood of 0 and let f u c be a smooth map having the following properties 1 f 0 0 2 df x 1 1 2 for all x u 3 dc x dc f x for every x u then v f u is a relatively open neighborhood of 0 in c and the map f u v is a diffeomorphism that is f and f 1 are smooth in the sense defined above the proof of proposition 3 73 follows from three lemmata proved below lemma 3 74 with the assumptions of proposition 3 73 the image v f u is a relatively open subset of c and f u v is an open map more over 1 2 x x f x f x 3 2 x x x x u 70 proof abbreviating g x x f x and g x 1 df x and using the convexity of the set u we obtain the identity g x g x 1 0 g x 1 x d x x 137 for x x u from which the desired estimate 70 follows in view of property 2 we conclude in particular that the map f u v is injective in order to show that the image v f u is a relatively open subset of c we take a point y v then f x y for a unique x u and since u is a relatively open subset of c there exists r 0 such that b x 3 r c u here we denoted by b x 3 r the open ball in rn centered at x and having radius 3 r we claim that b y r c v in order to prove our claim we first show that y b x r c dc y 0 v to see this we take a point x 0 b x 3 r c such that dc x 0 0 and let y 0 f x 0 by property 3 dc y 0 0 next we take an arbitrary point y 1 b y r c also satisfying dc y 1 0 and consider the points y 1 y 0 y 1 for 0 1 abbreviating 0 1 y v and sup we assume that 1 we note that is non empty since 0 and dc y 0 then we choose a sequence n such that n and the corresponding sequence of points y n belonging to b y r c satisfying y n y since y n v we find points xn u such that f xn y n and dc xn dc y n 0 by 70 xn x 2 f xn f x 2 y n y 2 r and xn xm 2 y n y m which show that xn is a cauchy sequence belonging to b x 2 r hence xn converges to some point x belonging to b x 2 r by continuity of f f x y and the point x belongs to the interior of c since by property 3 dc x dc y 0 now the classical inverse function theorem implies that there are open neighborhoods w and w of x and y f x both contained in the interior of c such that the map f w w has a continuous inverse f 1 w w in particular if 0 is small then y v contradicting 1 summing up we have proved our claim that y b y r c dc y 0 v next we take any point y b y r c satisfying dc y 1 we find sequences yn b y r c and xn f 1 yn satisfying dc yn dc xn 0 and yn y 0 from 70 we have xn x 2 yn y 2 r and xn xm 2 yn ym from which we deduce the convergence of the sequence xn to some point x b x 3 r c hence f x y implying 138 that y v this shows that b y r c v and that v is a relatively open subset of c finally to see that f u v maps relatively open subsets onto relatively open subsets we take an open subset u of u since u can be written as a union of relatively open convex subsets of c employing the previous arguments we conclude that v f u is an open subset of v the proof of lemma 3 74 is complete from the above lemma we obtain immediately the following corollary corollary 3 75 with the assumptions of proposition 3 73 the map f u v is a smooth homeomorphism between the relatively open subsets u and v of c we would like to point out that we cannot employ the usual implicit function theorem it only applies at interior points therefore we must provide an argument for the smoothness of the inverse map f 1 one could try to avoid work by first showing that f can be extended to a smooth map defined on an open neighborhood of 0 in rn however our notion of smoothness does not stipulate that f is near every point the restriction of a smooth map defined on an open subset of rn this would complicate the construction of a smooth extension lemma 3 76 with the assumptions of proposition 3 73 the iterated tangent map t kf t ku t kv is a smooth homeomorphism proof the set t kc is a partial quadrant in t krn and the sets t ku and t kv are relatively open subsets of t kc then the iterated tangent map t kf t ku t kv is smooth since the map f u v is smooth hence we only have to show that t kf has an inverse t kf 1 t kv t ku which is continuous in order to prove this we proceed by induction starting with k 1 we introduce the map 1 tv tu defined by 1 y l f 1 y df f 1 y 1 l the map 1 is continuous since by corollary 3 75 the map f u v is a homeomorphism moreover 1 tf x h f 1 f x df f 1 f x 1 df x h x h 139 and similarly tf 1 1 hence 1 is an inverse of the tangent map tf this together with the continuity of tf and 1 show that tf is a homeomorphism as claimed now we assume that result holds for k 1 and we show that t k 1 f t k 1 u t k 1 v is a homeomorphism recalling that t k 1 u t ku t krn we define the map k 1 t kv t krn t ku t krn k 1 y l t kf 1 y d t kf t kf 1 y 1 l by the inductive assumption the map t kf t kv t ku is a homeomor phism and hence k 1 is well defined and continuous moreover k 1 t k 1 f x h k 1 t kf x d t kf x h t kf 1 t kf x d t kf t kf 1 t kf x 1 d t kf x h x d t kf x 1 d t kf x h x h and similarly t k 1 f k 1 1 hence the map k 1 is a continuous inverse of the iterated tangent map t k 1 f this completes the inductive step and the proof of the lemma lemma 3 77 let u be a relatively open subset of a partial quadrant c rn and f u c a smooth map satisfying the assumptions of theorem 3 73 we assume that the image v f u is a relatively open subset of c and f u v a homeomorphism such that df x is invertible at every point x u then the inverse map g f 1 is of class c 1 and its derivative at the point y v is given by dg y df g y 1 proof by assumption the map f u v is a homeomorphism this im plies that g v u is also a homeomorphism and the map v l rn defined by y 7 df g y 1 is continuous next we take y 0 v and h rn satisfying y 0 h v then there are unique points x 0 and x 0 u such that f x 0 y 0 140 and f x 0 y 0 h recalling the abbreviation g f 1 we note that g y 0 x 0 g y 0 h g y 0 and f x 0 f x 0 h and compute 1 h g y 0 h g y 0 df x 0 1 h 1 h df x 0 1 f x 0 f x 0 h 1 df x 0 1 f x 0 f x 0 df x 0 from 70 in lemma 3 74 we obtain 1 2 h 3 2 so that h 0 if and only if 0 the limits vanish since f is differentiable at x 0 the proof of the lemma is finished now we are in the position to prove proposition 3 73 proof of proposition 3 73 under the hypotheses of the proposition the pre vious discussion shows for every k that t kf t ku t kv satisfies the hypotheses of lemma 3 77 for a suitable choice of data i e taking t kc as partial quadrant in t krn hence we conclude that t kf 1 is c 1 which precisely means that t kg is c 1 in other words g is of class c 1 k since k is arbitrary we conclude that g is c 3 8 5 an implicit function theorem in partial quadrants we shall prove a version for the classical implicit function theorem for maps defined on partial quadrants theorem 3 78 we assume that u is relatively open neighborhood of 0 in the partial quadrant c 0 k rn k in rn and consider a map f u rn of class cj j 1 satisfying f 0 0 moreover we assume that df 0 rn rn is surjective and the kernel k kerdf 0 is in good position to c and let y be a good complement of k in rn so that rn k y then there exist an open neighborhood v of 0 in the partial quadrant k c and a map v y of class cj and positive constants having the following properties 1 0 0 d 0 0 and k k u if k v 141 2 if k v satisfies k then k 3 if f k y 0 for k v satisfying k and y y satisfying y then y k the proof will follow from several lemmata where we shall us the nota tions x k y k y k y for k k and y y interchangeably the restriction df 0 y y rn is an isomorphism and we abbreviate its inverse by l df 0 y 1 y rn instead of studying the solutions f y 0 we can as well study the solutions of f x 0 where f is the composition f l f it satisfies df 0 k 0 if k k and df 0 y y if y y in abuse of notation we shall in the following denote the composition f l f by the old letter f again we may therefore assume that f u k y y has the form f k y y b k y 71 where b 0 0 0 and db 0 0 0 72 by bk a we denote the open ball in k of radius a centered at 0 similarly by b is the open ball in y of radius b centered at 0 lemma 3 79 there exist constants a 0 and b 0 such that 1 bk a by b c u 2 b k y b k y 1 2 y y for all k bk a c and y y by b c moreover if f k y f k y for k y and k y bk a by b c then y y proof it is clear that there exists constants a b 0 such that 1 holds to verify 2 we estimate for k y and k y bk a by b c b k y b k y 1 0 d 2 b k sy 1 s y ds y y 73 142 in view of db 0 0 0 we find smaller a b such that d 2 b k y 1 2 for all k y bk a by b c so b k y b k y 1 2 y y as claimed in 2 if f k y f k y for two point k y k y bk a by b c then y b k y y b k y and using 2 y y b k y b k y 1 2 y y which implies y y this completes the proof of lemma 3 79 to continue with the proof of the theorem we recall that k is in good position to c and y is a good complement of k in rn therefore there exists 0 such that for k k and y y satisfying y k the statements k y c and k c are equivalent lemma 3 80 replacing a by a smaller number while keeping b we have b k y k for all k bk a c and y k proof first we replace a by a perhaps smaller number such that a b if k bk a c and y k then k y c and k y 1 k 1 a introducing c a 1 max x b 1 a db x we observe that c a 0 as a 0 in view of db 0 0 0 then we estimate for k bk a c and y y satisfying y k using that b 0 0 0 b k y 1 0 db sk sy ds k y max x b 1 a db x 1 k c a k 74 the assertion follows if we choose a so small that c a 143 now we take a 0 so small that c a 2 and keep the original b 0 for every k bk a c we set xk by k and x k bk a c xk clearly x u by lemma 3 80 b k xk xk and by lemma 3 79 the map b k is a contraction therefore it has a unique fixed point k xk satisfying k b k k we claim that if y by b c and b k y y for some k bk a c then y k indeed since b k k k it follows that f k y f k k and lemma 3 79 shows that y k as claimed lemma 3 81 the map bk a c by b is continuous and satisfies k k 2 proof in view of 74 the estimate k k 2 follows from k b k k c a k and from the choice c a 2 in order to prove continuity of we fix a point k 0 bk a c and use lemma 3 79 to estimate k k 0 b k k b k 0 k 0 b k k b k k 0 b k k 0 b k 0 k 0 1 2 k k 0 b k k 0 b k 0 k 0 this implies k k 0 2 b k k 0 b k 0 k 0 2 1 0 d 1 b sk 1 s k 0 k 0 ds k k 0 k k 0 75 where we have used our choice of a that c a 1 maxx b 1 a db x 2 this finishes the proof of the continuity of the map lemma 3 82 if f u rn is of class cj j 1 then the map bk a c by b is also of class cj 144 proof we fix the point k bk a c and assume that k k bk a c then we abbreviate a k 1 0 d 2 b k k s k k 1 s k d 2 b k k ds r k b k k k b k k d 1 b k k k using the fixed point property k b k k and k k b k k k k we compute k k k d 1 b k k k b k k k k b k k d 1 b k k k b k k k b k k d 1 b k 0 k 0 b k k k k b k k k r k a k k k k d 2 b k k k k k therefore 1 d 2 b k k k k k d 1 b k k k r k a k k k k now r k k 0 and a k 0 as k 0 moreover in view of 75 k k k k k k consequently lim k 0 1 k k k k 1 d 2 b k k 1 d 1 b k k k 0 this shows that the map is differentiable at the point k and its derivative d k l k y is given by the familiar formula d k k 1 d 2 b k k 0 1 d 1 b k k k the formula shows that 7 d k is continuous since and db are con tinuous maps consequently the map is of class c 1 we also note that differentiating k b k k we obtain d k k d 2 b k k d k k d 1 b k k k db k k k d k k 145 if now f is of class c 2 we define the c 1 map f 1 v k y y y y by f 1 k h y y b k y db k y h y b k y db k y h and find by the same reasoning as before using that d 2 b k y for small k y is contractive that the associated family of fixed points k h 7 k d k h is of class c 1 near 0 0 in particular the map is of class c 2 near k 0 proceeding by induction we conclude that is of class cj on a possibly smaller neighborhood v of 0 in k the proof of theorem 3 78 is finished 146 4 manifolds with boundary with corners the previous chapter showed a solution set of a sc fredholm section which is a sub m polyfold whose induced polyfold structure is equivalent to the structure of a finite dimensional smooth manifold with boundary with cor ners in this chapter we shall study these objects in more details the results of chapter 4 will not be used later on 4 1 characterization a smooth manifold with boundary with corners is a hausdorff space m which admits an atlas of smooth compatatible quadrant charts v u c rn where v u is a homeomorphism from an open subset v m onto a relatively open set u of the partial quadrant c of rn a m polyfold x is a hausdorff space which in addition is equipped with a sc structure this prompts the following definition definition 4 1 a m polyfold x has a compatible smooth manifold structure with boundary with corners if it admits an atlas a consisting of sc smoothly compatible charts v u c rn where v u is a sc diffeomorphism from the open set v x onto the relatively open set u c of the partial quadrant c in rn or in a finite dimensional vector space e the transition maps between the charts are sc diffeomorphisms between relatively open subsets of partial quadrants in finite dimensional vector spaces and therefore are classically smooth maps i e of class c consequently the atlas a defines the structure of a smooth manifold with boundary with corners the aim of section 4 1 is the proof of the following characterization theorem 4 2 characterization for a tame m polyfold x the following statements are equivalent i x has a compatible smooth manifold structure with boundary with cor ners ii x 0 x and the identity map 1 1 0 x x 1 x 7 x is sc smooth moreover every point x x is contained in a tame sc smooth polyfold chart v o c e satisfying x 0 o and the tangent space t 0 o is finite dimensional and in good position to the partial quadrant c in the sc banach space e 147 remark 4 3 if x 0 x the identity map 1 1 0 x x 1 has as its inverse the identity map 101 x 1 x the map 101 is always sc smooth hence if the map 110 x x 1 is sc smooth it is a sc diffeomorphism there is a subtle point in ii if x 0 x then xm x 0 as sets for all m 0 however it is possible that x 1 6 x as sc smooth spaces despite the fact that x 1 m xm 1 xi as sets in other words it is possible that as m polyfolds x 1 6 x even if the underlying sets are the same indeed recalling the definition of sc differentiability one realizes that the sc smoothness of 1 x x is completely different from the sc smoothness of 1 x x 1 this is the reason we use the notation 110 the identity map x x 1 in contrast if x is a finite dimensional vector space equipped with the constant sc structure then x x 1 as sc spaces the proof of theorem 4 2 requires some preparations and we start with a definition where we denote as usual with u c e a relatively open set u in the partial quadrant c of the sc banach space e definition 4 4 sc retraction a sc smooth retraction r u u is called a sc retraction if r um um 1 for all m 0 and if r u u 1 is sc smooth similarly if v x is an open subset of a m polyfold x we call the sc smooth retraction r v v a sc retraction if r v v 1 is sc smooth lemma 4 5 let o c e be a sc smooth retract and suppose that there exists a relatively open subset u c and a sc retraction t u u onto t u o then every sc smooth retraction s v v of a relatively open subset v c satisfying s v o is a sc retraction proof by assumption the sc smooth map t u u satisfies t t t and t u o in addition t u u 1 is sc smooth if now s v v is a sc smooth retraction onto s v 0 then t s v s v and hence s t s in view of the properties of t the composition t s v v 1 is sc smooth and hence s v v 1 is sc smooth as claimed definition 4 6 sc retract the sc smooth retract o c e is a sc retract if there exists a relatively open subset u c and a sc retraction t u u onto t u o 148 in view of the lemma 4 5 the choice of t is irrelevant being a sc retract is an intrinsic property of the sc smooth retract o c e lemma 4 7 if r u u is a sc retraction onto the sc smooth retract o c e then i r u o o i e consists of smooth points ii at every point o o the tangent space too dr o e is finite dimensional proof i if x u then by definition r x u 1 and using r r r r x r r x u 2 continuing this way we conclude that r x m 0 um u hence r u o u o ii at the point o o the linearization dr o e e is in view of i well defined and it is a sc operator since r is a sc map conse quently dr o e e is a compact operator between every level there fore the image of the projection dr o namely dr o e too must be finite dimensional this proves the lemma the sc retracts are characterized by the following proposition proposition 4 8 a sc smooth retract o c e is a sc retract if and only if o 0 o and 1 1 0 o o 1 is sc smooth proof if o c e is a sc retract there exists a sc retraction r u u onto r u o the retract has the induced m polyfold structure defined by the scaling om r um and o 1 inherits this structure so that o 1 m om 1 for all m 0 in view of lemma 4 7 o o hence the identity map 110 o o 1 is well defined according to definition 2 7 the map 110 is sc smooth provided the composition 110 r u e 1 is sc smooth which is the case because r is a sc map in order to prove the opposite direction we assume that o o and 1 1 0 o o 1 is sc smooth let r u u be a sc smooth retraction onto o r u then the composition u r o 1 1 0 o 1 inclusion u 1 is sc smooth the composition agrees with the map r u u 1 and the lemma is proved 149 the proof of theorem 4 2 will make use of the following technical result proposition 4 9 let o c e be a sc retract and t u u a sc retraction of the the relatively open subset u c onto o t u we assume that 0 o and the the tangent space t 0 o which by lemma 4 7 is finite dimensional is in good position to the partial quadrant c we denote by y a good complement of t 0 o so that e t 0 o y and abbreviate by p dt 0 e t 0 o y t 0 o the sc projection then there exist open neighborhoods u of 0 in o and v of 0 in t 0 o c such that p u v is a sc diffeomorphism we note that v t 0 o c t 0 o is a local m polyfold model because t 0 o c is a partial quadrant in t 0 o in view of proposition 3 22 the proof of proposition 4 9 is based on the implicit function theorem for sc fredholm sections proved in the previous chapter proof of proposition 4 9 we recall that u is a relatively open neighborhood of o in the partial quadrant c of the sc banach space e moreover t u u is a sc retraction onto o t u which contains 0 in view of lemma 4 7 the tangent space t 0 o dt 0 e is a smooth subspace of finite dimensions by assumption t 0 o lies in good position to c accordingly there exists a good sc complement y of t 0 o in e so that e t 0 o y it has the property that there exists 0 0 such that for a y t 0 o y satisfying y 0 a 0 the statements a c and a y c are equivalent we shall use in the following the notation u a y t 0 o y and denote by p the sc smooth projection p e t 0 o y t 0 o defined by p dt 0 now we consider the local strong bundle u y u 150 and the sc smooth section f u u y f u u f u whose principal part f u y is defined by f u 1 p u t u we observe that if u o then u t u and hence f u 0 we shall show later on that there are no other solutions u u of f u 0 locally near u 0 lemma 4 10 the section f is sc fredholm proof in order to verify that the sc smooth section f is regularizing we take u a y um and assume that f u y 1 p t a y ym 1 since t is sc smooth we conclude that y ym 1 and since a is smooth that a y um 1 showing that f is indeed regularizing the derivative of f at the smooth point u u has the form df u h 1 p h dt u h h p h 1 p dt u h for h e since df u is a sc operator and p is sc smooth the opera tor df 0 is a perturbation of the identity operator by a sc operator and therefore a sc fredholm operator in view of proposition 1 10 next we have to verify that at a given smooth point u u a filled version of f after modification by a sc section s is conjugated to a basic germ however in the case at hand we already work on relatively open subsets of a partial quadrant so that a filling is not needed we merely have to find a suitable sc section to obtain a section which is conjugated to a basic germ in general the good complement y in the decomposition e t 0 o y is not a subset of c however we claim that there exists a finite dimensional sc banach space b and a sc banach space w contained in c such that y b w which leads to the sc decomposition e t 0 o b w indeed if e rn f and the partial quadrant c e is of the form c 0 n f where f is a sc banach space then identifying the sc banach space fwith 0 n f we let b to be an algebraic complement of 151 y f in y and w y f so that y b w clearly w c and in order to verify that b is finite dimensional we take linearly independent vectors a 1 w 1 al wl in b and claim that the vectors a 1 al are linearly independent in rn if l i 1 ia l 0 then l i 1 i a i wi 0 w b w since b w 0 we conclude i 0 and l n hence dimb n in the general case there exists a sc isomorphism l e rn f mapping c onto the partial quadrant c 0 n f then the subspace l t 0 o is in good position to the partial quadrant c and l y is a good complement of l t 0 o in rn f by the above argument we find a finite dimensional subspace b and a sc banach space w contained in c so that l t 0 o b w with b l 1 b and w l 1 w we conclude that b is finite dimensional w is contained in c and y b w as claimed since w c c c t 0 o b w the finite dimensional space t 0 o b is in good position to c because it has a sc complement contained in c therefore the set c t 0 o b is a partial quadrant in t 0 o b in view of proposition 3 22 we shall represent an element u u as u a b w t 0 o b w where b w y y b w furthermore we denote by p the projection p y b w w in accordance with the notation in the definition of a basic germ we view y as rn w where n dim b and p as the sc projection p rn w w if u c is a smooth point near 0 we denote by cu the associated partial quadrant introduced in definition 2 33 the partial quadrant cu contains c so that cu cu t 0 o b w fixing the smooth point u c the map v 7 u v for v near 0 in cu maps an open neighborhood of 0 in cu to an open neighborhood of u in c we now study the principal part f u y near the fixed smooth point u make the change of coordinate v 7 u v and define the section g v by g v f u v 152 in addition we define a sc section s near near 0 in cu by s v f u 1 p t u t u v it has the property that at v 0 g 0 s 0 0 in the decomposition v a b w we interpret a b cu t 0 o b as a finite dimensional parameter and consider the germ a b w 7 g s a b w y then p g s a b w p 1 p a b w p b w w identifying an open neighborhood of 0 in cu t 0 o b with an open neighborhood of 0 in some partial quadrant 0 k rn k we conclude that g s is a basic germ whose contraction part happens to be identically zero we have used the local strong bundle isomorphism u v b w 7 v b w consequently f u is a sc fredholm germ and the proof of lemma 4 10 is complete the sc fredholm section f vanishes at the point u 0 so that f 0 0 its linearization is is given by df 0 h 1 p h h e therefore df 0 has the kernel ker df 0 t 0 o dt 0 e which by assumption is in good position to the partial quadrant c moreover its image is 1 p e y so that df 0 is surjective we are in position to apply the implicit function theorem corollary 3 47 and conclude that the local solution set of f near u 0 is represented by u u 0 f u 0 u a a t 0 o y a v u here u 0 u is an open neighborhood of 0 in u and v is an open neighbor hood of 0 in the partial quadrant t 0 o c of t 0 o the map v y is a sc smooth map satisfying 0 0 and d 0 0 that all sufficiently small solutions of f u 0 are of the form a a is in our special case easily verified directly 153 lemma 4 11 let f a y 0 and a 0 y 0 if is sufficiently small then y a proof from f a y 0 and f a a 0 we obtain y 1 p t a y and a 1 p t a a consequently y a 1 p t a y t a a as f is regularizing the solutions are smooth points since t is a sc map the map u 7 1 p t u is of class c 1 between the 1 levels and the derivative vanishes at u 0 1 p dt 0 0 therefore there exists 1 0 such that 1 p dt u l e 1 e 1 1 2 76 if u 1 1 consequently on level 1 y a 1 0 1 p dt u d y a 77 where u a y 1 a since t is a sc map satisfying t 0 0 we conclude from y 1 p t a y that y 1 is small if a and y are small on level 0 moreover the map is sc smooth and satisfies 0 0 and hence a 1 is small if a is small on level 0 summing up u 1 1 if is sufficiently small and we conclude from 76 and 77 the estimate y a 1 1 2 y a 1 so that indeed y a is is sufficiently small as claimed in lemma 4 11 we finally verify that the solutions f a a 0 belong to o if a is small on level 0 lemma 4 12 let f a a 0 and a 0 if 0 is sufficiently small then a a o proof we have to confirm that a a t a a from f a a 0 we conclude that a t a a p t a a so that our aim is to prove that a p t a a 154 applying the retraction t to the identity p t a a a t a a 78 and using t t t we obtain t p t a a a t a a hence abbreviating a 1 p t a a we arrive at the identity t a 1 a t a a 0 going to level 1 abbreviating a a 1 1 a a and observing that dt 0 a 1 a a 1 a we estimate 0 t a 1 a t a a 1 1 0 dt a d a 1 a 1 a 1 a 1 0 dt a dt 0 l e 1 e 1 dt a 1 a 1 since dt u l e 1 e 1 is continuous in u on level 1 there exists 1 0 such that dt v dt 0 l e 1 e 1 1 2 if v 1 1 arguing as in the previous lemma a 1 1 if a 0 and is sufficiently small consequently 0 a 1 a 1 1 2 a 1 a 1 1 2 a 1 a 1 therefore a 1 a and hence p t a a a if 0 is sufficiently small and lemma 4 12 is proved 155 in order to complete the proof of proposition 4 9 we set v a too c a 0 the map p satisfying p a a a is a sc diffeomorphism from the open set u a a a v in o to the open set v having the sc smooth map a 7 a a as its inverse this completes the proof of proposition 4 9 proof of theorem 4 2 we assume that i holds true the m polyfold x has a compatible smooth manifold structure with boundary with corners correspondingly there is an atlas of sc smoothly compatible partial quadrants charts v u c rn where v u is a sc diffeomorphism from the open subset v x onto the relatively open subset u c of the partial quadrant c in rn we take in rn the unique constant sc structure then the identity map 1 u u is a tame sc smooth retraction of u c rn clearly u u and 1 1 0 u u 1 is sc smooth consequently these charts define a tame m polyfold structure on x for which x 0 x and 1 1 0 x x 1 is sc smooth and the statement ii follows conversely if ii holds for the tame m polyfold x then x 0 x and 1 1 0 x x 1 is sc smooth if x x then we find a tame sc smooth polyfold chart v o c e such that the sc diffeomorphism v o satisfies x 0 it follows that o 0 o and 1 1 0 o o 1 is sc smooth by proposition 4 8 the sc retract o c e is a sc retract and hence there is a sc retraction t u u of a relatively open sbset u in the partial quadrant c satisfying o t u the tangent space t 0 o is a finite dimensional smooth subspace of the sc banach space e and by assumption in good position to c using proposition 4 9 we find an open neighborhood o of 0 in o and an open neighborhood v of 0 in t 0 o c and a sc diffeomorphsim p o v onto the finite dimensional polyfold model v t 0 o c t 0 o taking the open set v 0 1 o v the composition v 0 o p v is a sc diffeomorphism onto the finite dimensional model v t 0 o c t 0 o carrying out this construction around every point x x we obtain a 156 smoothly compatible atlas of tame charts and the statement i follows this completes the proof of theorem 4 2 4 2 smooth finite dimensional submanifolds we start with the definition definition 4 13 a smooth finite dimensional submanifold of the m polyfold x is a subset a x having the property that every point a a possesses an open neighborhood v x and a sc retraction s v v onto s v a v in contrast to the sc smooth sub m polyfold of an m polyfold in defi nition 2 20 the retracts in the above definition are sc retracts we also point out that a smooth finite dimensional submanifold is not defined as a sub m polyfold whose induced structure admits an equivalent structure of a smooth manifold with boundary with corners remark 4 14 the subset a x in definition 4 13 is called a smooth finite dimensional manifold for the following reasons the retraction s v v satisfying s s s is a sc map therefore the image s v x consists of smooth points so that every point a s v possesses a tangent space taa defined by taa ts a tax from the sc smoothness of the map s it follows that the projection ts a tax tax is a sc operator and therefore level wise compact hence its image taa is finite dimensional moreover as we shall show below the subsets a x are near points a a satisfying dx a 0 necessarily smooth finite dimensional manifolds in the classical sense the same holds true in the case dx a 0 under the additional assumption that the tangent space taa is in good position to the partial quadrant cax in tax next we are going to prove that a smooth finite dimensional submanifold a inherits from x a natural m polyfold structure as such the degeneracy 157 index da a is well defined and the boundary a is defined as the subset a a da a 1 let us first recall that a subset a of a topological space x is called locally closed if every point a a possesses an open neighborhood v a x having the property that a point b v a belongs to a if u a 6 for all open neighborhoods u of b proposition 4 15 a smooth finite dimensional submanifold a x of the m polyfold x has the following properties 1 a x and a inherits the m polyfold structure induced from x in particular a possesses a tangent space at every point in a and the degeneracy index da is defined on a 2 a is locally closed in x 3 a a a da x 1 x 4 110 a a 1 is sc smooth proof 1 a sc retraction is in particular a sc retraction and hence a inherits the m polyfold structure from x in view of proposition 2 21 since a sc retraction s has its image in x we conclude that a x implying that every point in a a has the tangent space taa ts s tax since a is a m polyfold the degeneracy index da is defined on a 2 in order to prove 2 we choose a point a a and an open neighborhood v x of a such that a suitable sc retraction s v v retracts onto s v a v if b v lies in the closure of a then there exists a sequence ak a satisfying ak b since v is open b v we conclude that ak a v for large k hence ak s ak and using that b v we conclude that s b limk s ak b implying that b a v 3 by definition a a a da x 1 we assume that a a satisfies da a 1 and show that dx a 1 if dx a 0 we find an open neighborhood v x of a which is sc diffeomorphic to a retract o e e this implies that there exists an open neighborhood u a of a which is sc diffeomorphic to a retract o e e so that da a 0 4 the postulated sc retraction is the identity on the retract a and a a so that 1 1 0 a a 1 is sc smooth the proof of proposition 4 15 is complete 158 open question it is an open question whether there is a difference be tween a smooth finite dimensional submanifold a and a sub m polyfold sat isfying a a and dimtaa being finite and locally constant in fact the question is if under the latter conditions 110 a a 1 is sc smooth we con jecture that this is not always the case rather we would expect for example if the dimension of the tangent space is equal to 1 the set a might be some thing like a branched one dimensional manifold as defined in 32 it would be interesting to see if such type of examples can be constructed for example consider the subset t x 0 r 2 1 x 1 0 y r 2 y 0 1 with the induced topology is it possible to find a sc smooth retract o e e where e is a sc banach space so that t is homeomorphic to o and o o from our previous discussion this is impossible if we require o to be a sc retract so far not much can be said about the structure of the smooth finite dimensional submanifold a at the boundary without additional assumptions in order to formulate such an assumption we consider a m polyfold x which is required to be tame thus at every smooth point a x the cone cax is a partial quadrant in the tangent space tax in view of proposition 2 36 and we can introduce the following definition definition 4 16 good position at a a a smooth finite dimensional submanifold a of the tame m polyfold x is in good position at the point a a if the finite dimensional linear subspace taa tax is in good position to the partial quadrant cax in tax we also need the next definition definition 4 17 tame submanifold a smooth finite dimensional sub manifold a x of the m polyfold x is called tame if equipped with its induced m polyfold structure the m polyfold a is tame the main result of the section is as follows theorem 4 18 let x be a tame m polyfold and a x a smooth finite dimensional submanifold of x if a is at every point a a in good position then the induced m polyfold structure on a is equivalent to the structure of a smooth manifold with boundary with corners in particular the m polyfold a is tame 159 proof the result will be based on proposition 4 2 we focus on a point a a then a is a smooth point and we find a sc smooth tame chart v a 7 o 0 where is a sc diffeomorphism from the open neighborhood v x of a onto the retract o satisfying a 0 the retract o c e is a tame local model by assumption taa is in good position to the partial quadrant cax in tax and there is a good complement y tax so that tax taa y therefore the tangent space t 0 o t a tax has the sc splitting t 0 o n y in which n t a taa and y t a y since o c e is tame the tangent space t 0 o has a sc complement z contained in c in view of proposition 2 35 hence e t 0 o z n y z lemma 4 19 the finite dimensional subspace n t a taa is in good position to c and y z is a good complement in e proof of lemma 4 19 by assumption n is in good position to c 0 t 0 o c t a cax t 0 o with the good complement y hence there exists 0 such that for n y n y satisfying y 0 n 0 we have n c 0 if and only if n y c 0 take the norm y z 0 y 0 z 0 on y z and consider n y z satisfying y z 0 n 0 and note that n c if and only if n c 0 if n c 0 we conclude from y z 0 n 0 that n y c 0 which implies n y c since z c we conclude that n y z c conversely we assume that n y z c satisfies y z 0 n 0 then it follows from z z c that n y c and hence n y c 0 t 0 o c from y 0 n 0 we deduce that n c 0 and hence n c having verified that n is in good position to c and y z is a good complement the proof of lemma is complete continuing with the proof of theorem 4 18 we recall that o c e is a tame retract hence there exists a relatively open subset u c and a sc smooth tame retraction r u u onto o r u since a x is a finite dimensional smooth submanifold of x we find an open neighborhood v x of a and a sc retraction s v v onto s v a v taking v and u small we may assume that v 1 o then defining t u u by t u s 1 r u 160 we compute using r and s s s t t s 1 r s 1 r s 1 s 1 r s s 1 r s 1 r t we see that t is a retraction moreover it is a sc retraction since s is a sc retraction it retracts onto t u a v anddt 0 e t a ts a tax t a taa n therefore q t u o is a sc retract and t 0 q n is in good position to c by lemma 4 19 now we can apply proposition 4 9 and conclude that that there are open neighborhoods v 1 of 0 in q and v 0 of 0 in c n such that p dt 0 is a sc diffeomorphism p v 1 v 0 in view of proposition 3 22 c n is a partial quadrant in n so that v 0 c n n is a local model which is tame since v 0 c n is open defining the open neighborhood v a 1 v 0 a of a in a the map p v a v 0 is a sc diffeomorphism defining a sc smooth tame chart on the m polyfold a the collection of all these charts defines a sc smoothly compatible structure of a smooth manifold with boundary with corners moreover the m polyfold a is tame the proof of theorem 4 18 is complete remark 4 20 if a is in good position at a then there exists and open neigh borhood v a x so that a is in good position for all b v a a in order to see this we observe that theorem 4 9 defines a chart from the sole knowledge that we are in good position at 0 since the tangent spaces of a move only slowly lemma 3 55 implies that we are in good position at the nearby points as well definition 4 21 general position let a x be a smooth finite dimensional submanifold of the m polyfold x then a is in general posi tion at the point a a if taa has in tax a sc complement contained in the reduced tangent space tra x as defined in definition 2 38 161 we end this subsection with a local result theorem 4 22 local structure of smooth submanifolds let a be a smooth submanifold of the tame m polyfold x we assume that a is in general position at the point x a assuming that txa has in txx a sc complement contained in trx x then there exists an open neighborhood u x on which the following holds 1 there are precisely d dx x many local faces f 1 fd contained in u 2 dx a da a for a a u 3 if a a u then the tangent space taa has in tax a sc complement contained in tra x 4 if 1 d then the intersection f i fi of local faces is a tame m polyfold and a f is a tame smooth submanifold of f at every point a a u f the tangent space ta a f has in taf a sc complement contained in tra f proof the result is local and going into a tame m polyfold chart of x around the point x we may assume that x o and x 0 o where o belongs to the tame retract o c e in which c 0 n w n do 0 is a partial quadrant in the sc banach space e rn w moreover a o is a smooth submanifold of o we recall that the faces of c are the subsets of e defined by fi a 1 an w e ai 0 and aj 0 for j 6 i and w w for a subset 1 n we introduce f i fi then the m polyfold o has the faces fi o fi and we abbreviate the intersection by f o f by definition 2 27 tr 0 o t 0 o 0 w in our local coordinates by assumption of the theorem the tangent space t 0 a t 0 o has in t 0 o a sc complement a tr 0 o so that t 0 o t 0 a a in view of the definition of tame the tangent space t 0 o has in e a sc complement z 0 w hence e t 0 o z toa a z and it follows that t 0 a has in e a sc complement y contained in w 0 w e t 0 a y y w 162 we denote by n taa a sc complement of t 0 a w in t 0 a t 0 a n t 0 a w from e w w t 0 a w y w t 0 a w y we obtain e t 0 a y n t 0 a w y n w using y w c we deduce c c n w and c t 0 a c y therefore the projection rn w rn induces an isomorphism from n to rn and from c n onto 0 n moreover the tangent space t 0 a is in good position to c and y is a good complement hence t 0 a c is a partial quadrant of t 0 a by proposition 3 22 as proved in proposition 4 9 the smooth submanifold a o is repre sented local as the graph a v v v v of a sc smooth map v y defined on an open neighborhood v of 0 in the partial quadrant t 0 a c of t 0 a satisfying 0 0 and d 0 0 the projection p a t 0 a c v defined by p v v v is a sc diffeomorphism from the m polyfold a and we conclude by proposition 2 24 that da a dt 0 a c p a for all a a u the points in t 0 a c are represented by n m n c t 0 a w so that the points a a are represented by a n m n m introducing t 0 a t 0 a t 0 f n m t 0 a ni 0 for i 163 the diffeomorphism p a v t 0 a c maps the intersection of faces a f to t 0 a c in particular if p a t 0 a c then a a f this implies that dt 0 a c p a dc a in view of proposition 2 36 dc a do a and we have verified for a a u that da a do a as claimed in the statement 2 of the theorem in order to prove the statement 3 we choose a a u then a v v with v t 0 a c the tangent space taa is the image of the linear map h 7 h d v h h t 0 a if a 0 then t 0 a w e and we conclude by means of the particular form of the map that also taa w e for all a a u intersecting with tao and using taa tao leads to tao taa w tao taa t r a o implying that taa has in tao a sc complement which is contained in t r a o this proves the statement 3 of the theorem as for the last statement we observe that in view of the arguments in the proof of proposition 2 43 the sets f are tame m polyfolds moreover a f are smooth submanifolds of f the previous arguments but now applied to a f conclude the proof of theorem 4 22 4 3 families and an application of sard s theorem if x is a tame m polyfold we introduce the family z rm x x rm x x the family rm x has a natural tame m polyfold structure defined by the product of the corresponding charts and we denote by p rm x rm p x the sc smooth projection using theorem 4 22 and sard s theorem we are going to establish the following result 164 theorem 4 23 let a z be a smooth submanifold of the tame m polyfold z we assume that the induced m polyfold structure is tame and the closure of a is compact denoting by p p a a rm the restriction of p to a we assume in addition that there exists 0 such that the following holds 1 for every rm satisfying the set p 1 a is compact and non empty 2 for z a there exists a sc complement tza in tzz which is contained in trz z then there exists a set of full measure rm of regular values of p having full measure in bm such that for the set a x x x a is a smooth compact manifold with boundary with corners having the ad ditional property that the tangent space txa at x a has in txx a sc complement contained in trx x remark 4 24 by proposition 2 36 the codimension of trx x is equal to dx x therefore if then the point x a can only belong to a corner if dx x dim a for example zero dimensional manifolds a have to lie in x x one dimensional a can only hit the dx 1 part of the boundary etc proof fixing a point z a there exists in view of theorem 4 22 and open neighborhood u z z of z in z such that there are precisely d dx z local faces f 1 fd in z u moreover for all subsets 1 2 d the intersection of a with f i fi is a tame smooth submanifold in f of dimension dima moreover the tangent space tz a f has a sc complement in tzf which is contained in trz f we cover the set z a p z with the finitely many such neigh borhoods u z 1 u zk and first study the geometry of the problem in one of these neighborhoods u zi which for simplicity of notation we denote by u z if 1 d and f the associated intersection of local faces we denote by f the interior of f i e the set f with its boundary removed the union of all f is equal to u z here we use the convention that for the empty subset of 1 d the empty intersection is equal to u z 165 from which the boundary is removed we note that f 1 d is a m polyfold without boundary by theorem 4 23 the intersection a f is a smooth manifold without boundary having dimension dim a with a subset we associate the smooth projection p a f r m p x using sard s theorem we find a subset bm of regular values of p having full measure the intersection 1 d has full measure in bm and consists of regular values for all the maps in 1 now we fix then the preimage p 1 a has the form a and by construction p 1 a f which is a smooth submanifold of a f moreover the tangent space tz a f at the point z x a f is equal to tz a f tz a f z where the linearized projection tp z tz a f tp z r m maps z isomorphically onto rm from our discussion we conclude in view of the assumption 2 of the theorem for z x u z that the tangent space tz a has a sc complement in trz x consequently a u z is a smooth submanifold of x in general position the argument above applies to every z 1 zk hence for every zi there exists a subset zi bm of full measure consisting of regular values the subset k i 1 zi b m has full measure and it follows for every that a x is a smooth compact submanifold of the m polyfold x which moreover is in general position 166 4 4 sc differential forms following 23 we start with the definition definition 4 25 let x be a m polyfold and tx x its tangent bundle a sc differential k form is a sc smooth map k tx r which is linear in each argument and skew symmetric the vector space of sc differential k forms on x is denoted by k x by means of the inclusion maps x i x the sc differential k form on x pulls back to a sc differential k form on x i defining this way the directed system k x k x i k x i 1 we denote the direct limit of the system by x and introduce the set x of sc differential form on x by x k k x next we define the exterior differential for this we use the lie bracket of vector fields which has to be generalized to our context as shown in 23 proposition 4 4 the following holds proposition 4 26 let x be a m polyfold and given two sc smooth vector fields a and b on x one can define the lie bracket by the usual formula which defines a sc smooth vector field a b on x 1 that is a b is a section of the tangent bundle t x 1 x 2 in order to define the exterior derivative d k x i 1 k 1 x i we take s sc differential k form and k 1 sc smooth vector fieldsa 0 a 1 ak on x and define k 1 form d on x by the following familiar formula d a 0 a 1 ak k i 0 1 id a 0 a i ak ai i j 1 i j ai aj a 0 a i a j ak 167 the exterior derivative d commutes with the inclusion map x i 1 x i occurring in the directed system and consequently induces a map d x x having the property d 2 0 the pair x d is a graded differential algebra which we call the de rham complex of the m polyfold x definition 4 27 the sc de rham cohomology of the m polyfold x is de fined as h sc x ker d im d there is also a relative version if x is a tame m polyfold the inclusion map x x restricted to local faces is sc smooth local faces are naturally tame m polyfolds and the same is true for the intersection of local faces therefore it makes sense to talk about differential forms on x and x i we define the differential algebra x x by x x x 1 x with differential d d j d where j x x is the inclusion one easily verifies that d d 0 and we denote the associated cohomology by h dr x x clearly a sc differential k form x induces a classical smooth differential form on a smooth finite dimensional submanifold n of the m polyfold x the following version of stokes theorem holds true theorem 4 28 let x be a m polyfold and let n be an oriented smooth n dimensional compact tame submanifold of x whose boundary n a union of smooth faces f is equipped with the induced orientation if is a sc differential n 1 form on x then m d f f here the submanifold n is not assumed to be face structured the sc smooth map f x y between two m polyfolds induces the map f y x in the usual way there is also a version of the poincare lemma formulated and proved in 23 the general the theory of sc differential forms on m polyfolds can be worked out as for the classical smooth manifolds we leave it to the reader to carry out the details 168 5 the fredholm package for m polyfolds chapter 5 is devoted to compactness properties of sc fredholm sections to their perturbation theory and to the transversality theory 5 1 auxiliary norms recalling section 2 5 we consider the strong bundle p y x over the tame m polyfold x the subset y 0 1 of biregularity 0 1 is a topological space and the map p y 0 1 x is continuous the fibers yx p 1 x have the structure of banach spaces we first introduce the notion of an auxiliary norm this concept allows us to quantify the size of admissible perturbations in the transversality and perturbation theory we point out that our definition is more general than the earlier one given in 21 but it works just as well definition 5 1 an auxiliary norm is a continuous map n y 0 1 r which has the following properties 1 the restriction of n to a fiber is a complete norm 2 if wk is a sequence in y 0 1 such that p wk x in x and n wk 0 then wk 0 x in y 0 1 any two auxiliary norms are locally compatible according to the later proposition 5 3 which is an immediate corollary of the following local com parison result lemma 5 2 let p y x be a strong bundle over the m polyfold x and let n y 0 1 r be a continuous map which fiber wise is a complete norm then the following statements are equivalent i n is an auxiliary norm ii for every x x there exists for a suitable open neighborhood v of x a strong bundle isomorphism y v k whose underlying sc diffeomorphism v o maps x to a point o o and constants 0 c c such that for all w p 1 v c n w h 1 c n w 169 where w p h proof assume that i holds we fix x x and choose for a suitable open neighborhood v v x x a strong bundle isomorphism y v k where k o is a local strong bundle and k v f c f e f is the retract k r v f define q o by q 0 0 x an open neighborhood of 0 x y 0 1 consists of all w y 0 1 for which the set of all p h w belongs to some open neighborhood of q 0 in k 0 1 in view of the continuity of the function n y 0 1 r there exists 0 such that n y 1 for all y 1 p h satisfying p q 0 h 1 in particular p q 0 2 and h 1 2 imply n w 1 using that n w n w and similarly for the norm 1 we infer for y close enough to x p w y and w p h that n w 2 h 1 on the other hand assume there is no constant c 0 such that c h 1 n w for p h w and p close to q then we find sequences yk x and wk satisfying p wk yk and hk 1 1 such that n wk 0 since n is an auxiliary norm we conclude that wk 0 x in y 0 1 which implies the convergence wk qk hk q 0 contradicting hk 1 1 at this point we have proved that given an auxiliary norm n there exist for every x x constants 0 c c depending on x such that c n w h 1 c n w for all w y 0 1 for which p w is close to x and p h w for a suitable strong bundle isomorphism to a local strong bundle model hence i implies ii the other direction of the proof is obvious since n is continuous and fiber wise a complete norm we see that the property 1 in the definition of an auxiliary norm holds the estimate in the statement of the lemma implies that also property 2 holds as a corollary of the lemma we immediately obtain the following propo sition 170 proposition 5 3 let p y x be a strong bundle then there exists an auxiliary norm n given two auxiliary norms n 0 and n 1 then there exists a continuous function f x 0 such that for all w p 1 x y 0 1 f x n 0 h n 1 h 1 f x n 0 h proof the existence follows from a continuous partition of unity argument using the paracompactness of x pulling back by strong bundle maps the standard norm 1 to the fibers of the strong bundles the local compatibility implies the existence of f 5 2 compactness results there are several different kinds of compactness requirements on a sc smooth section which are useful in practice it will turn out that they are all equiv alent for sc fredholm sections we note that compactness is a notion on the 0 level of x definition 5 4 let f be a sc smooth section of a strong bundle p y x 1 we say that f has a compact solution set if f 1 0 x x f x 0 is compact in x on level 0 2 the section f is called weakly proper if it has a compact solution set and if for every auxiliary norm n there exists an open neighborhood u of f 1 0 such that for every sc section s having support in u and satisfying n s y 1 for all y the solution set x x f x s x is compact in x 3 the section f is called proper if f has a compact solution set and if for every auxiliary norm n there exists an open neighborhood u of f 1 0 such that the closure in x 0 of the set x u n f x 1 is compact in point 3 we adopt the convention that if f x does not have bi regularity 0 1 then n f x obviously proper implies weakly proper which in turn implies compactness proper weakly proper compact solution set 171 in general for a sc smooth section f these notions are not equivalent the basic result that all previous compactness notions coincide for a sc fredholm section is given by the following theorem theorem 5 5 assume that p y x is a strong m polyfold bundle over the tame x and f a sc fredholm section if f has a compact solution set then f is proper in particular for a sc fredholm section the properties of being proper or being weakly proper or having a compact solution set are equivalent the proof is postponed to appendix 5 4 1 there are several other useful considerations the first is the following consequence of the local theorem 3 40 theorem 5 6 local compactness assume that p y x is strong bundle over the m polyfold x and f a sc fredholm section then for a given solution x x of f x 0 there exists a nested sequence of open neighbor hoods u i of x on level zero say x u i 1 u i x 0 i 0 such that for all i 0 clx 0 y u i f y 0 is a compact subset of xi the next result shows that compactness a notion on the 0 level also implies compactness on higher levels theorem 5 7 assume that p y x is a strong bundle over the tame m polyfold x and f is a sc fredholm section with compact solution set s x x f x 0 in x 0 then s is a compact subset of x proof by assumption s is compact in x 0 since f is regularizing s x as was previously shown x is a metric space hence we can argue with sequences take a sequence xk s we have to show that it has a convergent subsequence in x after perhaps taking a subsequence we may assume that xk x s in x 0 from theorem 5 6 we conclude that xk x on every level i this implies the convergence xk x in x we recall that a sc smooth section f of the strong bundle y x de fines by raising the index a sc smooth section f i of y i x i in view of the previous theorem we conclude that a sc fredholm section with compact 172 solution set produces a sc fredholm section f i with compact solution set note that it is a priori clear that f i is sc fredholm hence we obtain the following corollary corollary 5 8 let f be a sc fredholm section of the strong bundle p y x over the tame m polyfold x and suppose that the solution set f 1 0 is compact then f i is a sc fredholm section of p i y i x i with compact solution set 5 3 perturbation theory and transversality let us start with the case that p y x is a tame strong m polyfold bundle we shall study for a given sc fredholm section f the perturbed section f s where s p we need a supply of sc sections which we can only guarantee if we have enough sc smooth bump functions this is a weaker requirement than having sc smooth partitions of unity see appendix 5 4 2 for a more detailed discussion this is for example the case if x is built on sc hilbert spaces definition 5 9 the m polyfold x admits sc smooth bump functions if for every x x and every open neighborhood u x there exists a sc smooth map f x r satisfying f 6 0 and supp f u x in section 5 4 2 proposition 5 30 the following useful statement is proved proposition 5 10 if the m polyfold x admits sc smooth bump functions then for every x x and every open neighborhood u x there exists a sc smooth function f x 0 1 satisfying f x 1 and supp f u x one can even achieve that f y 1 for all y close to x we start with an existence result lemma 5 11 existence of sc sections we assume that p y x is a tame strong bundle over the tame m polyfold x which admits sc smooth bump functions let n be an auxiliary norm for p then for every smooth point x x every smooth point e in the fiber yx p 1 x and every 0 there exists for a given open neighborhood u of x a sc section s p satisfying s x e supp s u and n s x n e the proof is an adaption of the proof in 21 173 proof since x is metrizable it is a normal space we choose an open neighborhood q of x so that w q is strong bundle isomorphic to the tame local bundle p k o mapping x into 0 o we find an open neighborhood q of x whose closure in x is contained in q if we construct s w q with support in q we can extend it by 0 to x it suffices to construct a section s suitably in local coordinates hence we work in k o and choose a smooth point e p 1 0 the open set q corresponds to an open neighborhood o of 0 contained in o we write e 0 e let n k r be the auxiliary norm using the local strong bundle retraction r we define the sc section t o k by t y r y e so that t 0 0 e e if 0 there exists 0 such that n t y n t 0 n e for y o and y 0 using proposition 5 30 we find a sc smooth function o 0 1 satisfying 0 1 and having support in o y o y 0 the sc sections s y y t y of k o has the required properties next we discuss a perturbation and transversality result in the case that the m polyfold does not have a boundary our usual notation will be p y x for the strong bundle in case we have an auxiliary norm n and an open subset u of x we denote by 1 u p the space of all s p satisfying supp s u and n s x 1 for all x x in our applications u is the open neighborhood of the compact solution set of a sc fredholm section f we shall refer to 1 u p as the space of allowable sc sections the space 1 u p becomes a metric space with respect to the uniform distance defined by s s sup x x n s x s x x x the metric space 1 u p is not complete remark 5 12 we note however that if a section s belongs to the completion of 1 u p then the solution set of f x s x 0 is still compact provided f has a compact solution set and u is an open neighborhood adapted to the auxiliary norm n in the sense that n f x 1 for x u has the properties stipulated in the properness result theorem 5 13 perturbation and transversality interior case let p y x be a strong bundle over the m polyfold x satisfying x and assume that x admits sc smooth bump functions let f be a sc fredholm section with a compact solution set and n an auxiliary norm then there exists an open neighborhood u of the solution set s x x f x 0 174 such that for sections s p having the property that supp s u and n f x 1 for all x x the solution set sf s x x f x s x 0 is compact moreover there exists a dense subset o of the metric space 1 u p such that for every s o the solution set sf s has the property that f s x txx yx is surjective for all x sf s i e for all x sf s the germ f x is in good position in particular sf s is a m subpolyfold whose induced structure is equivalent to the structure of a compact smooth manifold without boundary one can follow the proof of theorem 5 21 in 21 in 21 we still worked with splicing cores for the convenience of the reader we therefore sketch the proof the details can be filled in using the arguments from 21 remark 5 14 in 21 we assume that the fibers of the strong bundle are separable sc hilbert spaces this is in fact not needed due to an improved treatment of the compactness in the present text also originally an auxiliary norm had to satisfy more properties involving weak convergence which again due to the improved compactness results is not needed the strategies of the proofs in this more general context are the same definition 5 15 the sc fredholm section g of the strong m polyfold bundle p y x is called transversal to the zero section if at every point x satisfying g x 0 the linearization g x txx yx is surjective proof of theorem 5 13 we choose s 0 in 1 u p and for given 0 we find 1 such that s 0 x s 0 x 1 2 for all x x define s 0 s 0 consider the solution set sf s 0 which we know is compact for every x sf s 0 x we find finitely many allowable sc sections sx 1 s kx x 1 u p such that the range of f s 0 x together with the sections sxj span yx then abbreviating 1 kx the map rkx x w y f y s 0 y kx j 1 j sjx y is a sc fredholm section of the obvious pull back bundle in view of the theorem about parameterized perturbations theorem 3 18 we also note that the linearization at the point 0 x is surjective in view of the the 175 interior case of the implicit function theorem theorem 3 19 there exists an open neighborhood u x x of x such that for every 0 y with y u x sf s 0 the linearization of the above section is surjective we can carry out the above construction for every x sf s 0 and obtain an open covering u x x sf s 0 of sf s 0 hence we find a finite open cover u xi i 1 p for every i we have sections sjxi 1 j kxi for simplicity of notation we list all of them as t 1 tm then by construction the section rm x w y 7 f y s 0 y m j 1 j tj y is sc fredholm and its linearization at every point 0 x with x sf s 0 is surjective there is a number 0 0 such that 0 implies n m j 1 j tj y 2 by the implicit function theorem we find an open neighborhood u rm 0 x of 0 sf s 0 such that the section f u y f y f y s y f y s 0 y m j 1 j tj y has a surjective linearization at every solution y u of the equation f y 0 moreover s f 1 0 is a smooth manifold containing 0 sf s 0 taking a regular value 0 for the projection s rm y 7 it is easily verified that f s 0 s 0 is transversal to the zero section see theorem 5 21 in 21 by construction n s 0 y 2 and n s 0 y s 0 y 1 2 for all y this completes the proof of theorem 5 13 remark 5 16 in practice we need to homotope from one sc fredholm opera tor to the other for example assume that f 0 and f 1 are sc fredholm sections for p y x both transversal to the zero section and having compact solu tion sets suppose further that ft t 0 1 is an interpolating arc satisfying the following first of all the section 0 1 x y t x ft x is sc fredholm and has a compact solution set now we can use the above construction for a given auxiliary norm to find an open neighborhood u of the 176 solution set and a small perturbation s supported in u satisfying s t 0 for t close to t 0 1 we already have transversality at the boundaries and such that t x 7 ft x s t x is transversal to the zero section then the solution set is a compact smooth cobordism between the originally given solution sets sfi for i 0 1 here we have to deal with the boundary situation which in this special case is trivial the reader will be able to carry out this construction in more detail once we have finished our general discussion of the boundary case the next result shows that under a generic perturbation we are able to bring the solution set into a general position to the boundary and achieve the transversality to the zero section the solution space is then a smooth manifold with boundary with corners definition 5 17 general position let p y x is a strong bundle over the m polyfold x and let f be a sc fredholm section we say that f x where f x 0 is in general position if f x txx yx is surjective and the kernel ker f x has a sc complement contained in the reduced tangent space trx x the associated result is the following theorem 5 18 perturbation and transversality general position we assume that p y x is a strong bundle over the m polyfold x which admits sc smooth bump functions let f be a sc fredholm section with com pact solution set and n an auxiliary norm then there exists an open neigh borhood u of the solution set s x x f x 0 such that for a section s p satisfying supp s u and n s x 1 for all x x the solution set sf s x x f x s x 0 is compact moreover there exists a dense subset o of the metric space 1 u p such that for every s o the solution set sf s has the property that for every x sf s the pair f s x is in general position in particular sf s is a sub m polyfold whose induced structure is equivalent to the structure of a compact smooth manifold with boundary with corners and dsf s x dx x for all x sf s we follow the ideas of the proof of theorem 5 22 in 21 proof by assumption f has a compact solution set sf given an auxiliary norm we can find an open neighborhood u of sf such that the solution set sf s is compact for every section s 1 u p 177 in order to prove the result we will choose s 0 1 u p and perturb nearby by introducing suitable sc sections we note that a good approxi mation of s 0 1 u p is s 0 where 1 is close to 1 so that we have to find a small perturbation of the latter if we take s 0 satisfying n s 0 y 1 for all y x there is no loss of generality assuming that s 0 0 by replacing f s 0 by f and n by cn for some large c the general strategy already appears in the proof of theorem 5 13 here the only complication is that we would like to achieve additional properties of the perturbed problem this requires a more sophisticated set up in the next step we choose enough sections in 1 u p say s 1 sm such that near every 0 x with x sf the section f y f y m i 1 i si y has suitable properties namely we require the following properties i f 0 x rm txx yx is surjective ii ker f 0 x is transversal to rm trx x rm txx the strategy of the proof is the same as the strategy in the proof of theorem 5 13 we fix a point 0 x with x sf and observe that if we have sc sections so that the properties i ii hold at this specific 0 x then adding more sections the properties i ii will still hold furthermore if for a section the properties i ii hold at the specific 0 x then they will also hold at 0 y for y sf close to x say for y u x sf as a consequence we only have to find the desired sections for a specific x and then noting that the collection of neighborhoods u x is an open cover of sf we can choose finitely many points x 1 xp such that the neighborhoods u x 1 u xp cover sf the collection of sections associated to these finitely many points then possesses the desired properties therefore it is enough to give the argument at a general point 0 x for x sf the way to achieve property i at 0 x is as in the proof of theorem 5 13 we take enough sc sections to obtain the surjectivity we take a linear subspace l complementing trx x in txx and add sections which at x span the image f x l at this point the combined system of sections already satisfies i and ii and taking the finite union of all these sections the desired properties at 0 x hold by the previous discussion this completes the construction 178 since sf is compact and since by construction the section f x 0 is in general position at every point 0 x we can apply the implicit function theorem to the section f y f y m i 1 i si y we deduce the existence of 0 such that the set s y rm x 2 and y x is a smooth manifold with boundary with corners containing 0 sf in addition the properties i ii hold for all y s and not only for the points 0 x 0 sf to be precise s rm x is a smooth submanifold with boundary with corners so that for every z x s the tangent space tzs has a sc complement in trz r m x if p s rm is the projection the set p 1 is compact hence we can apply theorem 4 23 and find for a subset of bm of full measure that the subset s x x x s of x is a smooth submanifold with boundary with corners having the property that every point is in general position so that for every point x s and every parameter the tangent space tzs has a sc complement contained in trx x the third result is concerned with a relative perturbation which vanishes at the boundary in case we already know that at the boundary we are in a good position if we have a sc fredholm germ f x then a good position requires f x to be surjective and the kernel to be in good position to the cone cxx such a germ would be in general position if we require in addition to the surjectivity of f x that the kernel has a sc complement in trx x clearly general position implies good position in sft or more generally in a fred holm theory with operations we have a lot of algebraic structure combining a possibly infinite family of fredholm problems in this case perturbations should respect the algebraic structure and genericity in these cases might mean genericity within the algebraic contraints in some of these cases gen eral position is not achievable but one can still achieve a good position the perturbations occurring in the context of a fredholm theory with operations are very often constructed inductively so that at each step the problem is already in good position at the boundary but has to be extended to a generic problem the following theorem is a sample result along these lines 179 theorem 5 19 perturbation and transversality good position assume that p y x is a strong bundle over the the tame m polyfold x which admits sc smooth bump functions let f be a sc fredholm section with compact solution set and n an auxiliary norm further assume that for every x x solving f x 0 the pair f x is in good position then there exists an open neighborhood u of the solution set s x x f x 0 so that for every section s 1 u p the solution set sf s x x f x s x 0 is compact moreover there exists an arbitrarily small section s 1 u p satisfying s x 0 near x such that f s is transversal to the zero section and for every x sf s the pair f x is in good position in particular sf s is a m subpolyfold whose induced structure is equivalent to the structure of a compact smooth manifold with boundary with corners proof by our previous compactness considerations there exists for a given auxiliary norm n an open neighborhood u of sf so that for s 1 u p the solution set sf s is compact by the usual recipe already used in the previous proofs we can find finitely many sections s 1 sm in 1 u p which are vanishing near x so that for every x sf the image r f x and the si x span yx of course in the present construction we are allowed to have sections which vanish near x since by assumption for x sf x we are already in good position which in fact implies that sf is already a manifold with boundary with corners near x then we consider as before the section x 7 f x m i 1 i si x and for a generic value of which we can take as small as we wish we con clude that the associated section s m i 1 i si has the desired properties the next result deals with a homotopy t 7 ft of sc fredholm sections during which also the bundle changes definition 5 20 generalized compact homotopy consider two sc fredholm sections fi of tame strong bundles pi yi xi having compact solution sets we shall refer to fi pi as two compact sc fredholm prob lem then a generalized compact homotopy between the two com pact sc fredholm problems consists of a tame strong bundle p y x and a sc fredholm section f where x comes with a sc smooth surjective map 180 t x 0 1 so that the preimages xt are tame m polyfolds and ft f xt is a sc fredholm section of the bundle y xt moreover f has a compact solution set and f xi p yi fi pi for i 0 1 remark 5 21 instead of requiring f xi p yi fi pi for i 0 1 one should better require that the problems are isomorphic and make this part of the data but in applications the isomorphisms are mostly clear so that we allow ourselves to be somewhat sloppy theorem 5 22 morse type structure we assume that all occurring m polyfolds admit sc smooth bump functions let f be a sc fredholm section of the tame strong bundle p y x which is a generalized compact homotopy between the compact fredholm problems fi pi for i 0 1 as in definition 5 20 we assume that pi yi xi are strong bundles over m polyfolds xi having no boundaries and that the fredholm sections fi are already generic in the sense that for all x sfi the germ fi x is in general position we assume further that x x 0 x 1 let n be an auxiliary norm on p then there exists an open neighborhood u of the solution set sf in x such that for all sections s 1 u p the solution set sf s is compact moreover there exists an arbitrarily small section s 0 1 u p which vanishes near x possessing the following properties 1 for every x sf s 0 the germ f s 0 x is in general position 2 the smooth function t sf s 0 0 1 has only morse type critical points proof applying the previous discussions we can achieve property 1 for a suitable section s 0 the idea then is to perturb f s 0 further to achieve also property 2 note that 1 is still true after a small perturbation hence it suffices to assume that f already has the property that f x is in good position for all x solving f x 0 the solution set s x x f x 0 is a compact manifold with smooth boundary components moreover d t s has no critical points near s in view of the assumption that fi xi are already in general position if we take a finite number of sc sections s 1 sm of p y x which vanish near x and are supported near s depending on the auxiliary norm n then the solution set s x f x m i 1 i si x 0 is a smooth manifold for is small enough using the classical standard implicit function theorem we find 181 a family of smooth embeddings s s having the property that 0 x 0 x and s s where s y x f x m i 1 i si y 0 our aim is to construct the above sections si in such a way that in addition the map y 7 d t y t y s is transversal at 0 s to the zero section in cotangent bundle t s then after having achieved this the parameterized version of sard s theorem will guarantee values of the parameter arbitrarily close to 0 for which the smooth section s 3 y 7 d t y t s is transversal to the zero section and hence the function y 7 t y will be a morse function on s since s s is a diffeomorphism we conclude that t s is a morse function having constructed this way the desired section s 0 the proof of the theorem will then be complete it remains to construct the desired family of sc sections s 1 sm we fix a critical point x s of the function t s 0 1 hence d t s x 0 then txs ker dt x since x is a smooth point we find a one dimensional smooth linear sc subspace z txx such that txx z ker dt x the proof of the following trivial observation is left to the reader lemma 5 23 for every element t xs there exists a uniquely determined sc operator b txs z satisfying dt x b if a txs ker dt x is a sc operator then dt x b a slightly more difficult is the next lemma lemma 5 24 assume that t xs is given then there exists a sc section s with sufficiently small support around x having the following properties 1 s x 0 182 2 f x b s x txs 0 we note that if a txs txs then also property 2 holds with b replaced by b a in view of txs ker f x proof since f is a sc fredholm section and f x 0 the linearization f x txx yx is surjective and the kernel is equal to txs then f x b txs yx is a sc operator i e the image of any vector in txs belongs to y if this operator is the zero operator we can take s 0 otherwise the op erator has a one dimensional image spanned by some smooth point e yx we are done if we can construct a sc section s satisfying s x 0 and having support close to x and s x txs txs yx has a one dimensional image spanned by e and ker s 0 txs ker f x b then a suitable multiple of s does the job denote by k txs the kernel of f x b and by l a complement of k in txs then l is one dimensional we work now in local coordinates in order to construct s we may assume that x 0 and represent s near 0 as a graph over the tangent space txs say q 7 q q with 0 0 and d 0 0 here o txs 0 v where v is a sc complement of txs in the sc banach space e the points in e in a neighborhood of 0 are of the form q q v where v v we note that q q o where o is the local model for x near 0 we split txs k l and correspondingly write q k l then we can represent the points in a neighborhood of 0 e in the form k l k l v choosing a linear isomorphism j l r we define the section s for k l v small by k l k l v 7 r k l k l v k l k l v j l e where has support around 0 small and takes the value 1 near 0 the section s is then the restriction of s to o if we restrict s near 0 to s we obtain s k l k l r k l k l j l e hence s 0 0 and the linearization of s at 0 restricted to txs is given by s 0 k l j l e 183 this implies that s 0 txs and f 0 b have the same kernel and their image is spanned by e therefore s multiplied by a suitable scalar has the desired properties and the proof of lemma 5 24 is complete continuing with the proof of theorem 5 22 we focus as before on the critical point x s of t s which satisfies d t s x 0 associated with a basis 1 m of t xs the previous lemma produces the sections s 1 sm consider the solution set s of solutions y of f y m i 1 i si y 0 since f y is onto for all y s the solution set s y f y m i 1 i si y 0 is a compact manifold with boundary diffeomorphic to s if small moreover s fibers over a neighborhood of zero via the map y 7 the smooth map y 7 d t s y tys 79 is a smooth section of the bundle over s whose fiber at y is equal to t ym we show that the linearization of 79 at 0 x which is a map rd txs t xs is surjective near 0 x s we can parameterize s using the implicit function theorem in the form y 7 y where 0 y y and i 0 x 0 using 79 and the map we obtain after a coordinate change on the base for small and z s near x the map z 7 d t z dt z t z where d acts only on the s part by construction the section vanishes at 0 x recall that by construction x x hence for fixed the map z 7 m i 1 i i 0 z is a vector field defined near x s which vanishes at x therefore it has a well defined linearization at x the linearization rd txs t xs at 0 x 184 is computed to be the mapping z 7 dt s x z dt x m i 1 i i 0 x dt s x z m i 1 i dt x i 0 x 80 the derivative dt s x determines the hessian of the map t s at the point x s the argument is complete if we can show that i 0 x b i ai 81 where the image of ai belongs to txs by the previous discussion dt x b i i so that the map 80 can be rewritten using dt x ai 0 as z 7 dt s x z m i 1 i i which then proves our assertion so let us show that the identity 81 holds we first linearize the equation f z d i 1 isi z 0 with respect to at 0 which gives tf z m i 1 i i 0 z d i 1 i si z 0 next we linearize with respect to z at z x leading to m i 1 i f x i 0 x s i x txs 0 for all i 1 m hence f x i 0 x s i x txs 0 this implies that i 0 x b i ai where the image of ai lies in the kernel of f x i e in txs at this point we have proved that the linearization of 79 185 at 0 x is surjective since the section is smooth there exists an open neighborhood u x of x in s so that if at 0 y we have d t s y 0 then the linearization of z d t s z at 0 y is surjective we can now apply the previous discussion to all points x solving d t s x 0 and using the compactness we find finitely many such points x 1 xk so that the union of all the u xi covers the critical points of t s for every i we have sc sections si 1 s i mi possessing the desired properties in order to simplify the notation we denote the union of these sections by s 1 sd then we consider the solutions of f y d i 1 i si y 0 again we denote the solution set by s it fibers over an open neighborhood of 0 in rd by construction the smooth map z 7 d t s z tzs has at every point 0 y satisfying d t s y 0 a linearization rd tys t y s which is surjective now we take a regular value small for the projection m rd and find by the parameterized version of sard s theorem that d t s is indeed a morse function the proof of theorem 5 22 is complete we conclude this subsection by adding two useful results the first re sult shows that we can always bring a proper fredholm section into a good position by a small perturbation theorem 5 25 perturbation into a good position we assume that p y x is a strong bundle over the tame m polyfold x and f a proper sc fredholm section we assume that x admits sc smooth bump functions fix an auxiliary norm n and choose an associated open neighborhood u of s f 1 0 such that the solution set sf s x x f x s x 0 is compact for all sc sections s in 1 u p then there exists a sc section 186 s 1 u p such that in addition the compact solution set sf s x x f x s x 0 has the property that for every x sf s the pair f s x is in good position to the boundary x in particular sf s has in a natural way the structure of a manifold with boundary with corners proof the theorem is a consequence of theorem 5 18 and the following lemma showing that general position implies good position lemma 5 26 assume that f x y is a sc fredholm section of the strong m polyfold bundle p y x over the tame m polyfold x if f is in general position then f is in good position proof we take a point x x solving f x 0 then the linearization f x txx yx is surjective this implies that f x is in good posi tion if d x 0 hence we assume that d d x 1 since f x is in general position the kernel kerf x is transversal to the reduced tangent space trx x in txx in particular dim kerf x codimtrx x which implies that dim kerf x d working in local coordinates we may assume that x 0 belongs to the partial quadrant c 0 d rn d w and that f rn w rn w the linearization f 0 rn w rn w is surjective and ker f 0 is transversal to 0 d rn d w this implies that k ker f 0 has a sc complement k contained in c to verify that k is a good complement of ker f 0 we take a k and b k if a c then since k c we conclude that also a b c conversely assuming a b c it follows from b c and a a b b that a c we have proved that k ker f 0 is in good position to c now fixing an auxiliary norm n of the strong m polyfold bundle p y x we find an open neighborhood u of the compact solution set sf f 1 0 and having the property that for every s 1 u p the solution set sf s is compact taking 0 we choose 0 1 and a sc section s 0 having its support contained in u and satisfying 1 n s 0 x 2 for all x x then we set s 0 s 0 the solutions set sf s 0 f s 0 1 0 is compact contained in u and consists of smooth points arguing as in the proof of theorem 5 18 we choose finitely many sc sections s 1 sm belonging to 1 u p such that the sections f r m x y defined by f y f s 0 y m j 1 jsj y 187 is in general position every point 0 x rm x with x sf there exists 0 0 such that 0 implies that m j 1 n sj y 2 in view of theorem 3 54 for every 0 x where x sf there exists an open neighborhood u x such that at every point y u x solving f y 0 the sc fredholm germ f y is in general position to the boundary rm x rm x using the compactness of the solution set sf s 0 there are finitely many sets u xi 1 i k and possibly smaller 0 such that s x f x 0 and 0 k i 1 u xi in particular if y s then f y is in general position and hence in view of the above lemma in good position to b 0 x then theorem 3 57 implies that s is a sub m polyfold of x and the induced m polyfold structure on s is equivalent to the structure of a smooth manifold with boundary with corners applying sard s theorem as in the proof of theorem 5 22 20 we find satisfying 0 such that setting s s 0 m j 1 jsj the sc fredholm section f s has the property that f s x is in general position for every x solving the equation f s f x 0 in view of the above lemma for any such x the linearization f s x is surjective and the ker f s x is in good position to x the proof of the theorem is complete the next result deals with the question how different perturbations which bring a sc fredholm section into good position are related the proof is left to the reader theorem 5 27 cobordism between good position perturbations let p y x be a strong bundle over the tame m polyfold x which is assumed to admit sc smooth bump functions assume that ft t 0 1 is a proper homotopy of sc fredholm sections assume n is an auxiliary norm for y x 0 1 and u an associated open neighborhood of the compact solution set s x t ft x 0 let ui u i x and ni n i for i 0 1 suppose further that si are sc section of y x supported in ui and satisfying ni si x 1 for all x x i 0 1 so that f si x is in good position to x for all smooth x with associated solution sets s 0 and s 1 which are compact manifolds with boundary with corners then there exists a sc section s x t with n s x t 1 for all x t supported in u and satisfying si s x i so that f defined by f x t f x s x t is at all smooth points x t in good position to the boundary in particular the associated solution set s is a compact manifold with boundary with corners 188 intersecting i x in the manifolds with boundary with corners s 0 and s 1 5 4 appendix 5 4 1 proof of theorem 5 5 theorem 5 5 let p y x be a strong m polyfold bundle over the m polyfold x and f a sc fredholm section of p if f has a compact solution set s then f is proper in particular for a sc fredholm section the properties of being proper or being weakly proper or having a compact solution set are equivalent proof we denote by n the auxiliary norm on a strong m polyfold bundle p fixing a solution x x of f x 0 we have to find an open neighborhood u x of x such that the closure clx y u n f y 1 is compact since f is regularizing the point x is smooth there is no loss of generality in assuming that we work with a filled version g of f for which we have a sc section s such that g s is conjugated to a basic germ hence without loss of generality we may assume that we work in local coordinates and f h t where h o c rn w is a basic germ and t o c rn w a sc germ satisfying t 0 0 here c is the partial quadrant c 0 k rn k w in the sc banach space e rn w then it suffices to find in local coordinates an open neighborhood u of 0 in the partial quadrant c such that the closure on level 0 of the set a w u h t a w 1 c 82 is compact the section t is a sc section satisfying t 0 0 therefore we find a constant 0 such that t a w 1 c for a w c satisfying a 0 w 0 83 we denote by p rn w w the sc projection by assumption h is a basic germ and hence p h is of the form p h a w w b a w for a w c near 0 here b is a sc contraction germ moreover 1 p h takes values in rn so that its range consists of smooth point in view of the sc contraction property 189 of b and since any two norms on rn are equivalent replacing 0 by a smaller number we may assume that the estimates b a w b a w 0 1 4 w w 0 84 and 1 p h a w 1 c 85 are satisfied for all a w a w c such that a 0 w 0 and w 0 since b 0 0 we find 0 such that b a 0 0 8 for all a rn such that a 0 86 for all a 0 and w 0 4 we introduce the closed set a z rn w a 0 z 0 2 and denote by b the closed ball in y 0 centered at 0 and having radius then we define the map f b y 0 by f a z w b a w z if a z w b then in view of 2 and 3 f a z w 0 b a w b a 0 0 b a 0 0 z 0 1 4 w 0 b a 0 0 z 0 4 8 2 3 4 and if a z and w w b then f a z w f a z w 0 b a w b a w 0 1 4 w w 0 we see that f is a parametrized contraction of b uniform in a z in view of the parametrized banach fixed point theorem there exists a unique continuous map b satisfying f a z a z a z for every a z thus a z b a a z z for all a z in particular if a z w b and z w b a w then w a z 190 now we define the open neighborhood u of 0 in c by u a w a 0 w 0 4 87 assume that a w u and that z h a w belongs to rn y 1 and satisfies z 1 c then z h a w t a w p h a w 1 p h t a w w b a w 1 p h t a w and w b a w z where z z 1 p h t a w 88 in view of the estimates 83 and 85 z

verify the claim that the closure on level 0 of the set defined in 82 is compact with a sequence an wn a w u h t a w 1 c we consider the corresponding sequence zn wn b an wn defined by 88 then the estimates 89 and 90 give zn 1 3 c and zn 0 2 which implies that wn an zn since the embedding e 1 e 0 is compact and an rn we conclude after taking a subsequence that an zn a z in e 0 rn w 0 from the continuity of the map we deduce the convergence wn an zn w a z in w 0 therefore the sequence an wn converges to a w in e 0 since by assumption the solution set of f is compact the proof of the properness of the fredholm section is complete 191 5 4 2 notes on partitions of unity and bump functions an efficient tool for globalizing local construction in m polyfolds are sc smooth partitions of unity definition 5 28 a m polyfold x admits sc smooth partitions of unity if for every open covering of x there exists a subordinate sc smooth partition of unity so far we did not need sc smooth partitions of unity for our constructions on m polyfolds we would need them for example for the construction of sc connections m polyfolds we point out that a classically smooth partition of unity on a banach space which is equipped with a sc structure induces a sc smooth partition of unity in view of corollary 1 20 however many banach spaces do not admit smooth partition of unity subordinate to a given open cover our discussion in this section is based on the survey article 9 by fry and mcmanusi on smooth bump functions on banach spaces the article contains many interesting open questions for many constructions one does not need sc smooth partitions of unity but only sc smooth bump functions definition 5 29 a m polyfold x admits admits sc smooth bump func tions if for every point x x and every open neighborhood u x there exists a sc smooth function f x r which is not identically zero and has support in u x for example if e is a hilbert space with a scalar product and asso ciated norm the map x 7 x 2 x e is smooth choosing a smooth function r r of compact support and satisfying 0 1 the function f x x 2 x e is a smooth non vanishing function of bounded sup port therefore if e is equipped with a sc structure the map is a sc smooth function on the hilbert space in view of corollary 1 20 using the hilbert structure to rescale and translate we see that the hilbert space e admits sc smooth bump functions currently it is an open problem whether the existence of sc smooth par titions of unity on m polyfolds x is equivalent to the existence of sc smooth bump functions the problem is related to an unsolved classical question in banach spaces is in every banach space the existence of a single smooth bump function we can use the banach space structure to rescale and trans late equivalent to the existence of smooth partitions of unity subordinate to given open covers for the discussion on this problem we refer to 9 192 sc smooth bump functions can be used for the construction of functions having special properties as the following example shows proposition 5 30 we assume that the m polyfold x admits sc smooth bump functions then for every point x x and every open neighborhood u x there exists a sc smooth function f x 0 1 with f x 1 and sup port in u x in addition we can choose f in such a way that f y 1 for all y near x proof by assumption there exists a sc smooth bump function g having sup port in u x and satisfying g 0 1 in order to achieve that the image is contained in 0 1 we choose a smooth map r 0 1 satisfying s 0 for s 1 and s 1 for s 1 and define the sc smooth function f by f g if in addition we wish f to be constant near x we take f y g y for 1 the survey paper 9 discusses in particular bump functions on banach spaces which are classically differentiable definition 5 31 ck bump function a banach space e admits a ck bump function if there exists a ck function f e r not identically zero and having bounded support here k 0 1 2 the existence of ck bump functions on lp spaces is a consequence of the following result due to bonic and frampton see theorem 1 in 9 theorem 5 32 bonic and frampton for the lp spaces the following holds for the usual lp norm let p 1 and let be the usual norm on lp 1 if is an even integer then p is of class c 2 if is an odd integer then p is of class cp 1 3 if p 1 is not an integer then p is of class c p where p is the integer part of p we deduce immediately for the sobolev spaces w k p that the usual norms u p wk p k d u plp have the same differentiability as lp 193 taking a non vanishing smooth function r r of compact support the map f x x p is a bump function of lp whose smoothness de pends on p as indicated in theorem 5 32 if is a bounded domain in rn and e w 1 4 is equipped with the sc structure em w 1 m 4 m 0 we deduce from 1 in theorem 5 32 that e admits sc smooth bump functions in contrast if e w 1 3 2 is equipped with the sc structure em w 1 m 3 2 then the straightforward bump function constructed by using 3 of theorem 5 32 would only be of class sc 1 does there exist a sc smooth bump function on e i e sc smooth and of bounded support in e the existence of sc smooth bump functions is a local property definition 5 33 a local m polyfold model o c e has the sc smooth bump function property if for every x o and every open neighbor hood u x o satisfying cle u x o there exists a sc smooth function f o r satisfying f 6 0 and supp f u x clearly the following holds theorem 5 34 a m polyfold x admits sc smooth bump functions if and only if it admits a sc smooth atlas whose the local models have the sc smooth bump function property the following class of spaces have the sc bump function property proposition 5 35 assume that o c e is a local m polyfold model in which the 0 level e 0 of the sc bananch space e is a hilbert space then o c e has the sc bump function property proof let be the inner product and the associated norm of e 0 we choose a smooth function r r of compact support and satisfying 0 1 then the function f x x 2 x e defines in view of corollary 1 20 a sc smooth function on e using scaling translating and composition with the sc smooth retraction onto o the proposition follows next we study the question of the existence of sc smooth partitions of unity by definition a m polyfold x is paracompact and therefore there exist continuous partitions of unity hence it is not surprising that the ex istence of sc smooth partitions of unity is connected to local properties of x namely to the local approximability of continuous functions by sc smooth functions 194 definition 5 36 a local m polyfold model o c e has the sc smooth approximation property provided the following holds given f v where v is an open subset of o such that clc v o f o 0 1 is a continuous function with support contained v and 0 there exists a sc smooth map g o 0 1 supported in v and satisfying f x g x for all x o theorem 5 37 the following two statements are equivalent i a m polyfold x admits sc smooth partitions of unity subordinate to any given open cover ii the m polyfold x admits an atlas consisting of local models having the sc smooth approximation property proof let us first show that i implies ii for the m polyfold x we take an atlas of m polyfold charts u o we shall show that the local models o c e posses the sc smooth approximation property let f v be as in definition 5 36 the sc smooth function f is defined on 1 o x and we extend it by 0 to all of x and obtain a continuous function g x 0 1 whose support is contained in the open set w 1 v satisfying clx w u define the open subset w of x by w x w g x 4 then clx w w for every x clx w there exists open neighborhood ux of x such that clx ux w and g x g y 2 for all y ux take the open cover of x consisting of u 0 x x g x 2 and ux x clx w by assumption there exists a subordinate sc smooth partition of unity consisting of 0 with the support in u 0 and x supported in ux x clx w then we define the function g x 0 1 by g y x clx w x y g x since the collection of supports of 0 and x is locally finite the sum is locally finite and therefore g is sc smooth we claim that g x g x for all x x in order to show this we first show that supp g w we assume that y supp g and let yk 195 be a sequence satisfying g yk 0 and yk y since g yk 0 every open neighborhood of y intersects supp x for some x clx w since the collection of supports supp x is locally finite there exists an open neighborhood q q y of y in x and finitely many points x 1 xm such that only the supports of the functions xi intersect q hence 0 g yk m i 1 xi yk g xi showing that yk m i 1 clx uxi w for large k 1 consequently y w and hence supp g w next given z u there exists an open neighborhood q q z of z in x such that q intersects only finitely many supports of functions belonging to the partition of unity if q intersects the support of 0 and none of the supports of the functions x then q u 0 and g y 0 for all y q consequently g y g y g y 2 for all y q if q intersects supports of the functions x there are finitely many points x 1 xl such that only the supports of the functions xi in tersect q hence g y l i 1 xi y g xi for all y q since g x g y 2 if y ux and g y 2 if y u 0 we conclude that g y g y 0 x g y l i 1 xi y g y l i 1 xi y g xi 2 l i 1 xi z g y g xi 2 2 l i 1 xi y for all y q consequently g y g y for all y u and f x g 1 x for x o this completes the proof that i implies ii 196 next we show that ii implies i for the m polyfold x we take an atlas of m polyfold charts u o t where the local models o c e t posses the sc smooth approximation property we assume that v is an open cover of x then there exists a refinement w some sets may be empty with the same index set which is locally finite so that w v and for every there exists an index t such that clx w u since x is metrizable we find open sets q such that q clx q w and q is a locally finite open cover of x using again the metrizability of x we find continuous functions f x 0 1 satisfying f q 1 and supp f w let 1 2 v w and f f 1 in view of the hypothesis ii for the triple f v 1 2 there exists a sc smooth function g o 0 1 having support in v and satisfying f x g x 1 2 for all x o going back tox and extending g 1 ontox by 0 outside ofw we obtain the sc smooth functions g x 0 1 satisfying g x 0 for x q then we define x 0 1 by x g x g x the family of functions is the desired sc smooth partition of unity subordinate to the given open cover v of x an immediate consequence of theorem 5 37 is the following result proposition 5 38 assume that the sc banach space admits smooth parti tions of unity then a local model o c e has the sc smooth approximation property the result below due to toru nczyk see 9 theorem 30 gives a com plete characterization of banach spaces admitting ck partitions of unity this criterion reduces the question to a problem in the geometry of banach spaces though this criterion is not easy to apply it serves as one of the main tools in the investigation of the question see 9 in order to formulate the theorem we need a definition 197 definition 5 39 if is a set we denote by c 0 the banach space of functions f r having the property that for every 0 the number of with f is finite the vector space operations are obvious and the norm is defined by f c 0 max f a homeomorphic embedding h e c 0 is coordinate wise ck if for every the map e r e h e is ck if n then c 0 n is the usual space c 0 of sequences converging to 0 theorem 5 40 toru nczyk s theorem a banach space e admits a ck partition of unity if and only if there exists a set and a coordinate wise ck homeomorphic embedding of e into c 0 an important class of banach spaces are those which are are weakly com pactly generated they have good smoothness properties and will provide us with examples of sc banach spaces admitting sc smooth partitions of unity definition 5 41 a banach space e is called weakly compactly gener ated wcg if there exists a weakly compact set k in e such that the closure of the span of k is the whole space e cle span k there are two useful examples of wcg banach spaces proposition 5 42 let e be a banach space i if e is reflexive then e is wcg ii if e is separable then e is wcg proof in case that e is reflexive it is known that the closed unit ball b is compact in the weak topology clearly e span b if e is separable we take a dense sequence xn n in the unit ball and define k 0 1 n xn n 1 then k is compact and in particular weakly compact the usefulness of wcg spaces lies in the following result from 12 see also 9 theorem 31 theorem 5 43 12 if the wcg space e admits a ck bump function then it also admits ck partitions of unity 198 corollary 5 44 let o c e be a local model where e 0 is a hilbert space then o c e has the sc smooth approximation property proof a hilbert space is reflexive and hence a wcg space we have already seen that a hilbert space equipped with a sc structure admits sc smooth bump functions and conclude from theorem 5 43 that it admits sc smooth partition of unity and consequently has the smooth approximation property in view of theorem 5 37 199 6 linearizations orientations and invariants in this chapter we introduce the notion of a linearization of a sc fredholm sec tion and discuss orientations and invariants associated to proper sc fredholm sections we refer the reader to 4 for some of the basic ideas around de terminants of linear fredholm operators and to 8 for applications of the more classical ideas to problems arising in symplectic geometry i e linear cauchy riemann type operators in polyfold theory the central issue is that the occuring linear fredholm operators which are linearizations of nonlinear sections do in general not depend as operators continuously on the points where the linearization was taken on the other hand there is some weak con tinuity property which allows to introduce determinant bundles however it is necessary to develop some new ideas 6 1 linearizations of sc fredholm sections let p y x be a strong bundle over the m polyfold x and f a sc smooth section of p if x is a smooth point in x and f x 0 there exists a well defined linearization f x txx yx which is a sc operator in order to recall the definition we identify general izing a classical fact of vector bundles the tangent space t 0 xy at the element 0 x with the sc banach space txx yx where yx p 1 x is the fiber over x denoting by px txx yx yx the sc projection the linearization of f at the point x is the following operator f x px tf x txx yx as in the case of vector bundles there is in general no intrinsic notion of a linearization of the section f at the smooth point x if f x 6 0 however dealing with a strong bundle we can profit from the additional structure we simply take a local sc section s defined near x and satisfying s x f x so that the linearization f s x txx yx is well defined to find such a sc section we take a strong bundle chart around x denoting the sections in the local charts by the same letters we 200 let r be the local strong bundle retraction associated with the local strong bundle it satisfies r x f x f x and we define the desired section s by s y r y f x since f x is a smooth point s is a sc section satisfying s x f x at the distinguished point x as desired if t is another sc section satisfying t x f x s x then f s x f t x t s x and the linearization t s x is a sc operator it follows from proposition 1 10 that f s x is a sc fredholm operator if and only if f s x is a sc fredholm operator in which case their fredholm indices agree because a sc operator is level wise a compact operator let now f be a sc fredholm section of the bundle p and x a smooth point in x then there exists by definition a sc section s satisfying s x f x and moreover f s x is a sc fredholm operator definition 6 1 if f is a sc fredholm section f of the strong bundle p y x and x a smooth point in x then the space of linearizations of f at x is the set of sc operators from txx to yx defined as lin f x f s x a a txx yx is a sc operator the operators in lin f x all differ by linear sc operators and are all sc fredholm operators having the same fredholm index this allows us to define the index of the sc fredholm germ f x by ind f x dim ker f s x dim yx im f s x we shall show that this index is locally constant the proof has to cope with the difficulty caused by the fact that in general the linearizations do not depend continuously as operators on the smooth point x recall that a m polyfold is locally path connected and that moreover any two smooth points in the same path component can be connected by a sc smooth path 0 1 x proposition 6 2 stability of ind f x let p y x be a strong bundle over the tame m polyfold x and f a sc fredholm section if x 0 and x 1 are smooth points in x connected by a sc smooth path 0 1 x then ind f x 0 ind f x 1 201 proof we shall show that the map t 7 ind f t is locally constant the difficulty is that the linearizations even if picked sc smoothly will in general not depend as operators continuously on t on top of it we have possibly varying dimensions of the spaces so that we need to change the filled version at every point however one can prove the result with a trick which will also be used in dealing with orientation questions later on we consider the tame m polyfold 0 1 x and consider the graph of the path we fix t 0 0 1 and choose a locally defined sc section s t x satisfying s t t f t for t x 0 1 x near t 0 t 0 we do not need a sc smooth partition of unity if we had one available then we could define such a section s which satisfies s t t f t for all t 0 1 we choose finitely many smooth points e 1 em such that the image of f s t 0 t 0 together with the ei span y t 0 next we take a smooth finite dimensional linear subspace l of t t 0 x which has a sc complement in t r t 0 x then the image of l under f s t 0 t 0 is a smooth finite dimensional subspace of y t 0 of dimension r say we choose smooth vectors p 1 pr spanning this space next we take m r many sc sections depending on t x locally defined so that at t 0 t 0 they take the different values e 1 em and p 1 pr now the section f t x f x s t x m p i 1 i si t x is defined near 0 t 0 t 0 and takes values in y the linearization at 0 t 0 t 0 with respect to the first and second variable is surjective and the kernel of the linearization has a complement contained in tr 0 t 0 t 0 r m p 0 1 x rm p trt 0 0 1 t r t 0 x hence ker f 0 t 0 t 0 is in good position to the boundary employing the implicit function theorem for the boundary case we obtain a solution manifold s of f 0 containing 0 t t for t 0 1 close to t 0 moreover if t x t s then ker f t t t t t s and f t t is surjective hence t 7 dim t 0 t t s is locally constant for t 0 1 near t 0 by construction ind f t 0 m p ind f 0 t 0 t 0 ind f 0 t t ind f t m p 202 therefore ind f t 0 ind f t for all t near t 0 6 2 linear algebra and conventions in he following we are concerned with the orientation which is crucial in our applications we follow to a large extent the appendix in 27 the ideas of the previous proof are also useful in dealing with orientation questions there we did not use sc smooth partitions of unity in the following however we shall assume the existence of sc smooth partitions of unity to simplify the presentation but the proofs could be modified arguing as in the index stability theorem we begin with standard facts about determinants and wedge products basically all the constructions are natural but usually depend on conven tions which have to be stated apriori since different authors use different conventions their natural isomorphisms can be different to avoid these dif ficulties we state our conventions carefully we also would like to point out that a zinger has written a paper dealing with these type of issues 45 he also describes some of the mistakes occurring in the literature as well as deviating conventions by different authors since the algebraic treatment of sft one of the important applications of the current theory relies on the orientations of the moduli spaces and the underlying conventions we give a comprehensive treatment of orientation questions using the notation introduced by zinger in 45 we define e maxe and e e where e is the dual of the vector space e a linear map e f between finite dimensional vector spaces of the same dimension induces the linear map e f defined by a 1 an a 1 an the map is nontrivial if and only if is an isomorphism the dual map f e of e f induces the map f e moreover we denote by f e 203 the dual of the map e f the composition of the two maps e f g between vector spaces of the same dimension satisfies there are different canonical isomorphisms e e depending on different conventions our convention is the following definition 6 3 if e is a finite dimensional real vector space and e its dual the natural isomorphism e e is defined by e 1 e n a 1 an det e i aj where n dim e if n 0 we set e 0 r from this definition we deduce for a basis e 1 en of e and its dual basis e 1 e n the formula e 1 e n e 1 en where the dual vector v of a vector v 6 0 in a one dimensional vector space is determined by v v 1 indeed e 1 en e 1 en 1 det e i ej e 1 e n e 1 en the definition of is compatible with the previous definition of induced maps 204 proposition 6 4 if e f is an isomorphism between two finite dimensional vector spaces and f e is its dual then the following diagram is commutative f e y y f e proof let f 1 fn be a basis of f and f 1 f n its dual basis of f then we define the basis e 1 en of e by ei fi its dual basis in e is given by e 1 f 1 e n f n and we compute f 1 f n e 1 en f 1 fn e 1 en f 1 fn e 1 en f 1 fn f 1 fn 1 similarly f 1 f n e 1 en f 1 f n e 1 en e 1 e n e 1 en e 1 en e 1 en 1 hence and the commutativity of the diagram is proved next we consider the exact sequence e of finite dimensional linear vector spaces e 0 a b c d 0 we recall that by definition the sequence is exact at b for example if im ker we deal with the exact sequence as follows 205 we take a complement z b of a so that b a z and a complement v c of b so that c b v then the exact sequence e becomes e 0 a a z b v d 0 here the first nontrivial map is a 7 a 0 the second is b z 7 z 0 and the third is v c 7 v the maps a a z z and v d are isomorphisms from the exact sequence e we are going to construct several natural isomorphisms fixing again some conventions the first natural isomorphism is the isomorphism e a d b c constructed as follows we abbreviate n dim a m dim b k dim c and l dim d e maps 0 to 0 next we take nonzero vector h a 1 an d 1 dl a d where a 1 an is a basis of a and d 1 dl is a basis for d then we define the basis b 1 bn of b by bi ai and the basis c 1 cl of v by ci di i 1 l now we choose a basis b 1 b m n of z and define the basis c 1 c m n of b c by c i b i finally we define e h b c by e a 1 an d 1 dl a 1 an b 1 b m n c 1 cl c 1 c m n 91 the two conventions here are that b 1 b m n are listed after the a 1 an and c 1 c m n are listed after c 1 cl apart from these two conventions how to list the vectors the resulting definition does not depend on the choices involved lemma 6 5 with the above two conventions the definition of e does not depend on the choices 206 the proof is carried out in appendix 6 7 1 associated with the exact sequence e there exists also a second natural isomorphism e c a d b 92 constructed as follows we first map c 1 ck a 1 an d 1 dl into c 1 ck e a 1 an d 1 dl which belongs to c b c and then we compose this map with the isomorphism c b c b defined by v b v b since e is well defined so is e for convenience we present a more explicit formula for e using the notations of e proposition 6 6 we fix the basis a 1 an of a and the basis d 1 dl of d and abbreviate their wedge products by a and by d in the complement of b c we have the basis c 1 cl defined by ci di the vectors b 1 bn b defined by bi ai are a basis of of a b and in the complement of a in b we choose the basis a b 1 b m n and define the basis c 1 c m n of b c by c i b i abbreviating c c 1 c l c 1 cm n we obtain the formula e c a d b 1 bn b 1 b m n b proof we already know from lemma 6 5 that e is well defined since e is well defined by construction e a d b 1 bn b 1 b m n c 1 c l c 1 cm n here ci bi and c i di then abbreviating the wedge product of the vectors b 1 bn b 1 b n m by b we obtain e c a d c b c b 6 3 the determinant of a fredholm operator for the determinants of sc fredholm operator later on we need some of the classical theory of determinants which can be found for example in 45 207 definition 6 7 the determinant det t of a bounded linear fredholm operator t e f between real banach spaces is the 1 dimensional real vector space defined by det t ker t coker t an alternative definition used by some authors is det t ker t coker t the two definitions are naturally isomorphic given a conven tion how to identify a and a definition 6 8 an orientation of an fredholm operator t e f is an orientation of the line det t we begin this subsection by deriving exact sequences associated to fred holm operators definition 6 9 let t e f be a fredholm operator between two banach spaces a good left projection for t is a bounded projection p f f having the following two properties 1 dim f r p 2 r p t r p by t we denote the collection of all good left projections for t in view of 1 the projection p satisfies dim coker p dim ker p hence p is a fredholm operator of index 0 since t is fredholm the composition p t is fredholm and ind p t ind p ind t ind t the set t of projections possesses a partial ordering defined by p q if and only if p pq qp for p and p belonging to t the intersection r p r p has a finite codimension in f lemma 6 10 given p p t there exists a projection p t satisfying p p and p p proof let x be a topological complement of r p r p in r p and let x be a topological complement of r p r p in r p so that x r p r p r p and x r p r p r p 93 208 then x x 0 indeed if z x x then z r p r p and it follows from 93 that z 0 for the subspace x x r p r p we choose a topological complement z in f so that f z x x r p r p let p f f be the projection onto r p r p along z x x then w p z x x w p x w p p z x x w pp z x x w consequently p pp p p similarly p p p p p hence p p and p p and in view of r pt r p we also have r p t r p associated with the projection p t there is the exact sequence e t p 0 ker t jp t ker pt p t f r p p t coker t 0 where jpt is the inclusion map p t is defined by p t f r p i p f r t for f f and pt x t x r p for x ker pt lemma 6 11 the sequence e t p is exact proof we follow the proof in 27 the inclusion jpt is injective and p t j p t 0 if pt x 0 then t x r p implying i p t x 0 since x ker pt we conclude t x 0 this proves exactness at ker pt assuming x ker pt hence pt x 0 we compute pt p t x p t t x r p pt t x r pt t x r t r t i e the composition pt p t vanishes if p t y r p 0 hence i p y r t there exists x e solving t x i p y consequently pt x t x r p i p y r p y r p 209 proving the exactness at f r p finally we show the surjectivity of the map pt given f r t coker t we choose x e satisfying pt x pf and compute pt f t x r p i p f t x r t f r t which finishes the proof of the exactness starting with the fredholm operator t e f and the projection p t we obtain from the exact sequence e t p 0 ker t jp t ker pt p t f r p p t coker t 0 recalling r p r pt the isomorphism e t p ker t coker t ker pt coker pt by definition of the determinant this means that e t p det t det pt is an isomorphism we rename this isomorphism for the further discussion and setting e t p p t we have the isomorphism pt det t det pt we consider the fredholm operator t e f and the projections p q t satisfying p q so that p pq qp then as we have already seen the composition qt is fredholm moreover p qt therefore the associated exact sequences e t p e t q and e qt p produce the following isomorphisms pt det t det pt q t det t det qt pqt det qt det pt the crucial observation is the following result whose proof is postponed to appendix 6 7 2 210 proposition 6 12 if t e f is a fredholm operator and q p t satisfy p q then qt e f is a fredholm operator and p qt moreover pqt q t p t from proposition 6 12 we conclude for the three projections p r s t satisfying p r and p s the relation ptr r t p t p st s t so that the diagram det t r t det rt y st y prt det st p st det pt is commutative implying the following corollary corollary 6 13 the map det st det rt h 7 prt 1 pst h is independent of the choice of p as long as p s and p r moreover this map is equal to the isomorphism det st det rt h 7 rt s t 1 h the latter may be viewed as some kind of transition map this will become clearer in the next subsection the first map in the corollary behaves smoothly with respect to certain bundle constructions it will turn out that the good left projection structures are very useful in the definition of determinant bundles for classical fredholm operators postponing the construction of determinant bundles there is an important stabilization construction which is the linearized version of a construction occurring in perturbation theory and which has to be understood from the point of view of orientations of determinants we start with a fredholm operator t e f and assume that rn f is a linear map such that the map t e rn f defined by t e r t e r is surjective writing rn after e is convenient and goes hand in hand with the conventions in the definition of the isomorphism e associated with the 211 exact sequence e we would like to introduce a convention relating the orientations of det t and det t knowing that rn possesses the preferred orientation as direct sum of n many copies of r each of which is oriented by 1 we introduce the exact sequence e 0 ker t j ker t rn f r t 0 in which j e e 0 e r r and r r r t lemma 6 14 the sequence e is exact proof clearly j 0 and j is injective if e r 0 then t e 0 and j e 0 e e r if e r ker t then t e r 0 implying that r r t hence r r t if r 0 we have r t e for some e e and hence e r ker t moreover e r r the last map is surjective since by assumption t is surjective from the exact sequence e we deduce the previously constructed natural isomorphism e det t ker t rn in the applications the operator t is oriented and the auxiliary constructions to obtain transversality yield on the linearized level operators of the type t the above isomorphism can be used to relate the orientations of det t and det t however this requires an additional convention for this it suffices to fix an isomorphism rn r 0 this gives rise to an isomorphism ker t rn ker t r det t which then yields an isomorphism det t det t the isomorphism we choose is defined by rn 0 r e 1 en 7 1 where e 1 en is the standard basis of rn it then follows for every basis c 1 cn of rn that c 1 cn 1 det c 1 cn 1 94 212 where det denotes the determinant of a n n matrix of the column vectors summing up the previous discussion and using the definition of the iso morphism e associated to the exact sequence e we can summarize the findings in the following proposition proposition 6 15 with the chosen isomorphism rn 0 r e 1 en 1 we define the isomorphism det t det t by the following formula we choose a basis a 1 ak of ker t and a basis d 1 c 1 r t d m c m r t of f r t let h a 1 ak d 1 d m extend a 1 0 ak 0 to a basis of ker t by adding b 1 b 1 r 1 b l bl rl and notice that r 1 b 1 r 1 rl bl rl together with c 1 c m form a basis of rn then the isomorphism is defined by the formula h 1 det c 1 c m r 1 rl a 1 0 ak 0 b 1 b l 1 this follows immediately from the definition of the isomorphism e asso ciated with the exact sequence e our choice of isomorphism rn r is of course dual to a uniquely determined choice of isomorphism r rn defined by the mapping which maps 1 to the wedge of the standard basis its inverse is the map c 1 cn det c 1 cn 95 here again det is the determinant of a n n matrix having chosen the isomorphisms 94 and 95 we deduce the following natural identifications for every finite dimensional vector space v v rn v v e 1 en 7 v 1 v and v rn v v e 1 en v 1 v we need another convention 213 definition 6 16 assume that t e f and s e f are fredholm operators then the direct sum t s e e f f is a fredholm operator and we define the natural isomorphism det t det s det t s as follows we choose h a 1 an d 1 dl det t and h a 1 a n d 1 d l det s then we map h h to the vector g det t s defined by g a 1 an a 1 a n d 1 dl d 1 d l 6 4 classical local determinant bundles we continue with some local constructions in the neighborhood of a fredholm operator t e f between two banach spaces lemma 6 17 given a fredholm operator t e f and a projection p t we take a topological complement y of ker pt in e then there exists 0 such that for every s l e f satisfying s t the following holds 1 p s 2 ps y y r p is a topological isomorphism proof we estimate pt y ps y p s t since pt y y r p is a topological linear isomorphism it follows from the openness of invertible linear operators y r p that 2 holds for a suitable since ps y r p is a topological linear isomorphism we conclude thatr ps r p which implies p s we assume the hypotheses of the previous lemma split e ker pt y and correspondingly write e k y for s satisfying s t we consider the equation ps k y 0 which can be rewritten as ps y ps k hence y y k s ps y 1 ps k the map k s 7 y k s is continuous we equipe the topological space s t s ker ps l e f e 214 with the induced topology the projection s t s ker ps s t s is the restriction of the continuous projection l e f e l e f and therefore continuous the fibers of are finite dimensional vector spaces of the same dimension lemma 6 18 the topological space s t s ker ps together with the continuous projection has the structure of a trivial vector bundle proof the continuous and bijective map s s t ker pt s t s ker ps is defined by s k 7 s k y k s its inverse is the restriction of the continuous map s s t e s s t ker pt s k y 7 s k so that our map is indeed a topological bundle trivialization now we have the trivial bundle s t s ker ps s s t and the product bundle 0 s s t f r p s s t the obvious viewpoint about these bundles is the following given the family of fredholm operators s 7 ps defined for s satisfying s t the kernel dimension and cokernel dimension is constant therefore we obtain the topological kernel bundle as well as the cokernel bundle we shall need the following standard lemma which can be derived from results in f e in 29 215 lemma 6 19 given finite dimensional topological vector bundles e and f over the topological space x the bundles e x f x as well as e f x and e f x have the structure of topological vector bundles in a natural way from lemma 6 19 we deduce immediately the following result proposition 6 20 the topological space s t s det ps together with the projection onto the set s s t has in a natural way the structure of topological line bundle we introduce for the fredholm operator t and the projection p t the abbreviation det t p s t s det ps where 0 is guaranteed by lemma 6 18 we shall call det t p the local determinant bundle associated with the fredholm operator t the projection p t and for the projection q t satisfying q p we abbreviate det t q s t s det qs which again in a natural way is a topological line bundle lemma 6 21 the algebraic isomorphism t p q det t p det t q s h s q ps h is a topological line bundle isomorphism proof this is trivial and follows from an inspection of the maps q ps a sketch of the proof goes as follows we start with the exact sequence 0 ker ps ker qs f r q f r p 0 216 here s t since q p t and q p the kernels of ps and qs define topological bundles if we vary the fredholm operators s this is trivially true for the cokernel bundles associated to ps and qs which are honest product bundles in view of r ps r p and r qs r q we can take linearly independent continuous sections which span the kernels of the ps similarly for the cokernels we can take constant sections now going through the construction of the maps q ps we see that we can extend the kernel sections for the ps to a family of continuous sections which are point wise linearly independent and span the kernels of the qs proceeding the same way with the cokernels we obtain at the end a continuous family of point wise linearly independent sections spanning ker qs and f r q taking the appropriate wedges and tensor products we see that a continuous section of the first line bundle is mapped to a continuous section of the second the argument can be reversed to verify the continuity of the inverse map now we introduce the bundle det e f s f e f s det s over the space of all fredholm operators at first sight this set seems not to have a lot of structure globally though near certain s it has some due to the previous discussion the problem is that in the definition of det s the ingredients ker s and f r s associated to s might have varying local dimensions however in view of the discussion in the previous subsection we shall see that we can equip det e f with the structure of a topological line bundle over the space of fredholm operators f e f this structure will turn out to be natural i e the structure does not depend on the choices involved in its construction here it is important to follow the conventions already introduced we have the projection map det e f f e f s h 7 s the base f e f has a topology but the total space det e f at this point has not given t f we can invoke proposition 6 20 and find 0 and p t such that t p det e f s s t det t p s h 7 s ps h 217 is a bijection which is fibers wise linear and covers the identity on the base definition 6 22 denote by b the collection of all subsets b of det e f having the property that there exists t p for which t p b is open in det t p the fundamental topological observation is the following proposition proposition 6 23 the collection of sets b is a basis for a topology on det e f postponing the proof for the moment we denote the topology associated with b by t and obtain the following result proposition 6 24 the set det e f with its linear structure on the fibers equipped with the topology t is a topological line bundle the maps t p det e f s s t det t p s h s ps h are topological bundle isomorphisms in order to prove the previous two propositions we recall the maps t p and t p we are interested in the transition map t p 1 t p the domain of this map consists of all pairs s h satisfying t s and s t and h det ps the transition map preserves the base point and maps h to an element in det p s this transition map is obviously an algebraic isomorphism between two topological line bundles lemma 6 25 the transition map t p 1 t p is a topological isomor phism between topological line bundles proof it suffices to prove the continuity of the transition map near a base point s 0 since the same argument also applies to the inverse map we choose a projection q satisfying q p and q p in view of corollary 6 13 the transition map t p 1 t p is equal to s h 7 s qp s 1 qps h this map is continuous in view of lemma 6 21 let us finally remark that it is known that the line bundle det e f is non orientable however over certain subsets it is orientable and that will be used in the discussion of sc fredholm sections 218 6 5 local orientation propagation and orientability viewed locally a classical fredholm section f is a smooth map f u f from an open subset u of some banach space e into a banach space f the derivatives df x x u form a family of fredholm operators depending continuously as operators on x u the determinant line bundle of this family of fredholm operators is a smooth line bundle over u if u is contractible this line bundle possesses precisely two possible orientations because a line has precisely two possible orientations indeed in this case the orientation of one single line in the bundle determines a natural orientation of all the other lines we might view this procedure as a local continuous propagation of an orientation this method however is not applicable in the sc fredholm setting be cause the linearizations do not in general depend continuously on the base point but there are additional difficulties for example we are confronted with nontrivial bundles where the dimensions can locally jump neverthe less there is enough structure which allows to define a propagation of the orientation and this is the core of the orientation theory in the following section we consider the sc fredholm section f of the strong m polyfold bundle p w x over the tame m polyfold x choose for a smooth point x x a locally defined sc section s satisfying s x f x and take the linearization f s x txx yx the linearization f s x belongs to the space of linearizations lin f x which is a subset of linear fredholm operators txx yx possessing the induced metric defined by the norm of the space l txx yx of bounded operators moreover lin f x is a convex subset and therefore contractible introducing the line bundle det f x l lin f x l det l over the convex set lin f x the previous discussion shows that det f x is a topological line bundle proposition 6 26 det f x has in a natural way the structure of a topo logical line bundle over lin f x and consequently has two possible orienta tions since the base space is contractible definition 6 27 orientation let f be a sc fredholm section of the strong m polyfold bundle p y x over the tame m polyfold x and x x 219 a smooth point then an orientation for the pair f x denoted by o f x is a choice of one of the two possible orientations of det f x let us denote by of the orientation space associated to f which is the collection of all pairs x o in which x x and o is an orientation of det f x we consider a category whose objects are the sets orfx ox ox of the two possible orientations of det f x the reader should not be confused by our notation there is no distinguished class ox we only know there are two possible orientations namely ox and ox for any two smooth points x and y in the same path component of x the associated morphism set consists of two isomorphisms the first one maps ox oy and the second one ox oy proposition 6 28 if f is a sc fredholm section of the strong m polyfold bundle p y x then every smooth point x possesses an open neighborhood u u x having the following properties 1 u is sc smoothly contractible 2 the solution set x clx u f x 0 is compact 3 given a sc smooth path 0 1 u there exists a sc section s u 0 1 y having the property that s t t f t 4 if t 0 0 1 y 0 u and e 0 is a smooth point in yy 0 then there exists a sc section q u 0 1 y satisfying q y 0 t 0 e 0 proof taking local strong bundle coordinates coordinates we may assume that the bundle is p k o and x 0 here k r v f is the strong bundle retract covering the sc retraction r satisfying r v o as usual v c is an open neighborhood of 0 in the partial quadrant c of the sc banach space e there is no loss of generality assuming that v is convex note that in this case o is sc smoothly contractible by the contraction r 0 1 o o r t y r ty indeed for y o we have that y v and since 0 v we have for t 0 1 that ty v so that r ty is defined if t 1 then r 1 y r y y and if t 0 then r 0 y r 0 0 the sc fredholm section f possesses the local compactness property we can therefore choose a convex neighborhood v 220 of 0 c such that u r v is sc smoothly contractible and so small that clc u o and the restriction f clc u has a compact solution set at this point we have constructed an open neighborhood u of x which has the first two properties shrinking u further so that it is still the retract of a convex open subset of v will keep these properties we have to show that an additional shrinking will guarantee 3 and 4 the section f of k o has the form f y y f y where r f y f y the map f is the principle part of the section f and is sc smooth as a map from o to f if 0 1 u is a sc smooth path t 0 1 and y u then y f t o f v f and we define the map s u 0 1 k by s y t r y f t the map s is a sc section of the pull back of the bundle k o by the map u 0 1 o y t 7 y by construction s t t r t f t r f t f t this proves 3 the statement 4 was already proved in some variation in the sections about fredholm theory formulated in the local coordinates the statement 4 assumes that the smooth point e 0 y 0 e 0 k and t 0 0 1 are given the required section q o 0 1 k can be then defined as the section q y t r y e 0 it satisfies q y 0 t 0 r y 0 e 0 y 0 e 0 e 0 as desired now we are in the position to define a propagation mechanism since it will involve several choices we have to make sure that the end result is independent of the choices involved the set up is as follows we have a strong bundle p y x over the m polyfold x and an sc fredholm section f of p around a smooth point x x we choose an open neighborhood u u x so that the statements 1 4 of proposition 6 28 hold there is no loss of generality assuming that x u if 0 1 x is a sc smooth path we employ proposition 6 28 and choose a sc section s x 0 1 w satisfying s t t f t adding finitely many sc sections s 1 sk defined on x 0 1 we obtain the sc fredholm section f 0 1 x rk w f t y f y s y t k i 1 i si y t 221 having the property that for 0 the points t t 0 are solutions of f t t 0 0 for fixed t 0 1 we introduce the sc fredholm section ft x rk y y f t y the discussion so far is true for all choices s 1 sk using the results from the transversality theory we can choose s 1 sk such that in addition ft has a good boundary behavior lemma 6 29 there exist finitely many sc sections s 1 sk of the bundle y 0 1 x such that the sc smooth fredholm section f of the bundle y 0 1 rk x defined by f t y f y s y t k i 1 i si y t has the following property p p for every fixed t 0 1 the section ft is at the point t 0 in general position to the boundary of x rk property p automatically implies that f is in general position to the boundary of 0 1 x rk at all points t t 0 for t 0 1 as a consequence of the implicit function theorem for the boundary case we obtain the following result lemma 6 30 the solution set s t y f t y 0 for t y 0 near t t 0 is a smooth manifold with boundary with corners hence t t 0 t 0 1 s moreover it follows from the property p that the projection s 0 1 t y 7 t is a submersion the set st defined by t st 1 t is a manifold with boundary with corners contained in x rk we do not claim that st is compact but the manifold st lies in such a way in x rk that its intersection with x rk carves out a boundary with corners on the manifold st the tangent space t t 0 st at the point t 0 st agrees with the kernel ker f t t 0 and abbreviating lt t t 0 st ker f t t 0 for t 0 1 222 we introduce the bundle l of tangent spaces along the path t s for t 0 1 by l t 0 1 t lt the bundle l is a smooth vector bundle over 0 1 by l we denote the line bundle associated with l l t 0 1 t lt an orientation of the lines lt determines by continuation an orienta tion of all the other lines in particular an orientation of l 0 at t 0 determines an orientation of l 1 at t 1 and we shall relate these orien tations to the orientations of det f 0 and det f 1 to this aim we introduce for every fixed t 0 1 the exact sequence et defined by et 0 ker f s t t j ker f t t 0 p p rk c y t r f s t t 0 96 in which j is the inclusion map p the projection onto the rk factor and the map c is defined by c k i 1 isi t t r f s t t lemma 6 31 the sequence 96 is exact proof the inclusion map j is injective and p j 0 from p h 0 it follows that 0 so that h ker f s t t if h ker f t t 0 then isi t t belongs to the image of f s t t which implies c p 0 it is also immediate that an element rk satisfying c 0 implies that isi t t belongs to the image of f s t t this allows us to construct an element h ker f t t 0 satisfying p h finally it follows from the property p in lemma 6 29 that the map c is surjective the proof of lemma 6 31 is complete from the exact sequence et we deduce the natural isomorphism et in troduced in section 6 2 et ker f s t t coker f s t t kerf t t 0 rk 223 and obtain in view of the the definition of the determinant the isomorphism et det f s t t lt rk now we assume that we have chosen the orientation o 0 of det f 0 at t 0 it induces an orientation of det f s 0 0 the isomorphism e 0 determines an orientation of l 0 rk by continuation we extend this orientation to an orientation of l 1 rk then the isomorphism e 1 1 at t 1 gives us an orientation of det f s 1 1 and consequently an orientation o 1 of det f 1 at t 1 denoted by o 1 o 0 and called the push forward orientation a priori our procedure might depend on the choices of the sections s y t and s 1 sk and we shall prove next that it actually does not proposition 6 32 we assume that f is the sc fredholm section of the strong m polyfold bundle p y x and u u x an open neighborhood around a smooth point x for which the conclusions of proposition 6 28 hold let 0 1 u be a sc smooth path then the construction of the map o o associating with an orientation of det f 0 an orientation o of det f 1 does not depend on the choices involved as long as the hypotheses of lemma 6 29 hold the proof of the proposition follows from two lemmata lemma 6 33 under the assumption of the proposition we assume that the sc fredholm section f t y f y s y t k i 1 i si y t satisfies the property p from lemma 6 29 we view f as section of the bundle y 0 1 x rk adding more sc sections we also introduce the second sc fredholm section f t y f t y l j 1 j s j y t viewed as a section of the bundle y 0 1 x rk l then both sections define the same propagation of the orientation along the sc smooth path 224 proof the key is to view f as the section f t y f y s y t k i 1 i si y t of the strong m polyfold bundle y 0 1 0 1 x rk l there is a sc fredholm section f 0 1 0 1 x rk l y defined by f t y f t y l j 1 j s j y t the induced map x rk l y for fixed t 0 1 0 1 satisfies the property p we obtain a solution manifold s with boundary with cor ners defined near the points t t 0 which fibers over 0 1 0 1 let s 0 1 0 1 and consider its tangent map then take the vec tor bundle l 0 1 0 1 whose fiber over t is the preimage of the zero section of t 0 1 0 1 under t for 0 we obtain the bundle l 0 0 0 1 0 1 this is of the form l 0 1 rl 0 1 where l is the bundle associated to f which we used originally to define the propagation along applying the construction now using l 0 one verifies by a simple computation that it defines the same propagation hence it remains to verify that every bundle l 0 1 defines the same propagation first of all we note that as varies the bundle varies continuously moreover we relate the end points to det f s 0 0 and det f s 1 1 the data in the occurring exact sequence relat ing the latter with the corresponding orientations of l vary continuously this implies that the propagation definition does not depend on next we show that the choice of the sc section s satisfying s t t f t does not affect the definition of the propagation 225 lemma 6 34 we assume that the sc sections si for i 0 1 satisfy si t t f t and consider the homotopy s s 1 1 s 0 we choose additional sections s 1 s k so that the property p holds together with s for every then the propagation of the orientation along the sc smooth path using each of the collections s s 1 s k is the same proof the proof is similar as the lemma above we obtain a vector bundle l 0 1 0 1 with parameters t in the base then we can define for fixed a vector bundle over t 0 1 say l clearly l varies continuously in at t 0 1 the linearizations f s 0 0 and f s 1 1 vary continuously as operators in det f 0 and det f 1 respec tively this implies that the bundle l induces independently of 0 1 the same propagation of the orientation along the path now we are in the position to finish the proof of proposition 6 32 we start with two collections si si 1 s i ki to define the propagation and add for i 0 and i 1 additional sc sections such that the following holds 1 for both situations i 0 and i 1 we have the same number of sections 2 for a convex homotopy parametrized by 0 1 the property p holds for each fixed by lemma 6 33 adding section does not change the propagation we can apply this for i 0 1 then we can use lemma 6 34 to show that these two propagations after adding sections are the same next assume we have the same hypotheses and u u x has the initially stated properties if the two sc smooth paths 0 1 0 1 u have the same starting and end points we homotope sc smoothly from one to the other with end points fixed using that u is sc smoothly contractible we denote this sc smooth homotopy by 0 1 0 1 u where i i 0 for i 0 1 then we construct the sc section s satisfying s t t f t and define the sc fredholm section t y f y s y t k i 1 i si y t 226 possesing the obvious properties for every we obtain a vector bundle l 0 1 since all the data change continuously in these bundles and the operators for t 0 1 in det change continuously in we see that every l defines the same propagation of the orientation along paths hence we have proved the following statement theorem 6 35 we assume that p y x is a strong bundle over the tame m polyfold and x a smooth point in x then there exists an open sc smoothly contractible neighborhood u u x such that for every sc smooth path 0 1 u there exists a well defined propagation o o of an orientation o of det f 0 moreover if 0 and 1 0 1 u are two sc smooth paths from the same starting points to the same end points then the propagation along 0 and 1 is the same i e 0 o 1 o having this theorem there are precisely two possible ways to orient the family det f y y u so that these orientations are related by propa gation along paths namely we fix x and take for y u a sc smooth path 0 1 u starting at x and ending at y fixing an orientation ox of det f x we define oy ox the definition is independent of the choice of the path at this point we have a map which associates to a smooth point y u i e y u an orientation oy of det f y it follows from theorem 6 35 that if is a sc smooth path connecting y 1 with y 2 then oy 1 oy 2 definition 6 36 given a strong bundle p y x over the tame m polyfold x and a sc fredholm section f we call an open contractible neigh borhood u x of a smooth point x on which the local propagation construc tion can be carried out an orientable neighborhood of f x any two of the possible orientations of det f y for y u which have the propaga tion property is called a continuous orientation an orientable neighborhood has precisely two continuous orientations now we globalize the local propagation of orientation constructions to a more global procedure let x be an m polyfold and 0 1 x a sc smooth map we denote by its sc smooth homotopy class with end points fixed associated with 227 we have the source s which is the starting point 0 and the target t which is the end point 1 given two sc smooth homotopy classes and satisfying t s we define the composition as the class of defined as follows take a smooth map 0 1 0 2 satisfying that 0 1 2 0 1 0 0 and s 1 for s near 1 2 moreover 1 2 1 1 2 and 1 2 then we define the sc smooth path by t s for s 0 1 2 and t s for s 1 2 1 this way we obtain a category px whose objects are the smooth points in x and whose morphisms x y are the homotopy classes with source x and target y the main result of this section is described by the following theorem which is a consequence of the local constructions theorem 6 37 let p y x be a strong bundle over the tame m polyfold x and f a sc fredholm section then there exists a uniquely determined functor px f of which associates with the smooth point x the set orfx and with the sc smooth homotopy class x y a morphism f orfx orfy which has the following property given any smooth point x in x and a sc smoothly contractible open neighborhood u u x having the property that f on u has the local prop agation property then the maps or f 0 orf 1 and f or f 0 or f 1 coincide for a sc smooth path 0 1 u proof we consider the sc smooth path 0 1 x fix t 0 0 1 and choose an orientable neighborhood u t 0 then we find an open interval i t 0 so that an orientation ot for f t where t i t 0 0 1 determines an orientation for all s i t 0 0 1 now using the compactness of 0 1 and a finite covering map we can transport a given orientation o 0 of det f 0 to an orientation o 1 of det f 1 the map o 0 o 1 is denoted by by a covering argument one verifies that the map only depends on the homotopy class for fixed end points it is obvious that f is unique finally we can give two equivalent definitions of orientability of a sc fredholm section 228 definition 6 38 a sc fredholm section f of the strong bundle p y x over the tame m polyfold x is called orientable provided for every pair of smooth points x and y in the same path component the morphism f does not depend on the choice of the homotopy class x y an equivalent version is the following definition 6 39 let f be a sc fredholm section of the strong bundle p y x over the tame m polyfold x then f is called orientable if there exists a map which associates with a point y u an orientation oy of det f y having the following property for every smooth point x there exists an ori entable neighborhood u x for which u x 3 y 7 oy is one of the two continuous orientations finally we define an orientation of the sc fredholm section as follows definition 6 40 orientation of sc fredholm sections let p y x be a strong bundle over the tame m polyfold x and assume that f is a sc fredholm section an orientation of for f is a map which associates with every smooth point y x an orientation ofy of det f y such that for every smooth point x and orientable neighborhood u u x the restriction of u is one of the two possible continuous orientations we close this subsection with a general result theorem 6 41 we assume that p y x is a strong bundle over the tame m polyfold x let f be a proper sc fredholm section such that for every x x solving f x 0 the pair f x is in general position to the boundary x suppose of is an orientation for f then the solution set s f 1 0 is a smooth compact manifold with boundary with corners possessing a natural orientation proof we already know from the transversality discussion that s is a com pact manifold with boundary with corners if x s then ker f x txs and because f x is surjective every tangent space txs is oriented by o f x since of has the local continuation property one verifies that the differen tial geometric local prolongation of the orientation on s is the same as the fredholm one if f is not generic to start with we have to take a small perturbation s supported near the zero set of f so that the solution set sf s has a natural 229 orientation coming from of since det f s x has an orientation coming from det f x for x sf s remark 6 42 if f o is an oriented fredholm section of the strong bundle p y x and s is a sc section of y x 0 1 then the sc fredholm section f defined on x 0 1 by f x t f x s x t y has a natural orientation associated with o and the standard orientation of 0 1 we choose a local sc section t near the smooth point x satisfying t x f x and consider the orientation ox of det f t x where l f t x txx yx taking the vector h a 1 an b 1 bl determining the orientation of l we orient l t x t x 0 1 yx a b la by the vector h a 1 an e b 1 bl where the vector e defines the standard orientation of 0 1 the linear map l belongs to the linearization space of f at x t so that the latter obtains an orientation 6 6 invariants associated to proper sc fredholm sec tions the next result generalizes a classical fact of smooth compact manifolds to polyfolds for the convenience of the reader we first recall the relevant previous constructions we consider the oriented and proper sc fredholm section f o of the strong bundle p y x over the tame m polyfold x admitting sc smooth bump functions the solution set s x x f x 0 is compact if n is an auxiliary norm on p we know from the perturbation and transversality result theorem 5 18 that there exists an open neighborhood u x of s such that for every sc section s of p which is supported in u and satisfies n s x 1 for all x x the solution sets sf s x x f x s x 0 is compact moreover there exist distinguished such sc sections having the additional property that for all x sf s the pair f s x is in general position to the boundary x its solution set is a compact manifold with boundary with corners and as we have seen above possesses a natural ori entation induced from the orientation o of the sc fredholm section f in the following theorem we shall call these distinguished sc sections s admissible for the pair n u 230 in section 4 4 we have introduced the differential algebra x x x 1 x its differential d w d j w d in which j x x is the inclusion map satisfies d d 0 and we denote the associated cohomology by h dr x x theorem 6 43 let p y x be a strong bundle over the tame m polyfold x we assume that x admits sc smooth bump functions then there exists a well defined map which associates with a proper and oriented sc fredholm section f o of the bundle p a linear map f o h dr x x r having the following properties 1 if n is an auxiliary norm on p and s a sc section of p which is admissible for the pair n u then the solution set sf s x x f x s x 0 is an oriented and compact manifold with boundary with corners and f o sf s sf s holds for every cohomology class in h dr x x the integrals on the right hand side are defined to be zero if the dimensions of the forms and manifolds do not agree 2 for a proper and oriented homotopy between two oriented sc fredholm sections f 0 o 0 and f 1 o 1 of the bundle p we have the identity f 0 o 0 f 1 o 1 proof 1 the properness of the sc fredholm section f implies the compact ness of its solution set sf x x f x 0 if n is an auxiliary norm n then there exist by theorem 5 18 an open neighborhood u x of sf and a sc section of s 0 of p which is admissible for the pair n u such that the solution set s 0 sf s 0 x x f x s 0 x 0 is in addi tion an oriented compact manifold with boundary with corners of dimension n dimsf s 0 ind f x for x sf s 0 the orientation f o induces an orientation on sf s and its local faces we define the map f o by f o sf s 0 sf s 0 97 231 for a cohomology class in h dr x x the integrals on the right hand side are defined to be zero if the dimensions of the forms and manifolds do not agree in order to verify that the definition 97 does not depend on the choice of admissible section s 0 we take a second sc section s 1 admissible for the pair n u so that the solution set s 1 sf s 1 x x f x s 1 x 0 is a compact oriented manifold with boundary with corners as explained in remark 5 16 there exists a proper sc homotopy st connecting s 0 with s 1 such the sc fredholm section f defined onx 0 1 by f x t f x st x is in general position to the boundary of x 0 1 for every x t in the solution set sf x t x 0 1 f x st x 0 which is an oriented compact manifold with boundary with corners whose orientation is induced from the orientation o of f and the standard orientation of 0 1 we recall that satisfies d 0 and j d on x where j x x is the inclusion map extending to the whole space x 0 1 we introduce the form on x 0 1 by p 1 p 2 dt where p 1 x 0 1 x and p 2 x 0 1 0 1 are the sc projection maps it follows that d 0 and x 0 1 d where d p 1 d p 2 dt the maps pi for i 1 2 are the restrictions of pi to x 0 1 by stokes theorem sf d sf 0 we decompose the boundary sf of the manifold sf into sf s 0 s 1 s where s 0 x 0 s 1 x 1 and s x 0 1 as illustrated in figure 7 hence 0 sf sf d and we compute the two integrals taking the orientations into account 0 sf s 0 s 1 s 232 0 1 t x 0 x 1 s s 0 s 1 s 0 s 1 figure 7 integration of d over sf using stokes theorem gives 0 sf d s 0 d s 1 d s s 0 s 1 s comparing the integrals we obtain s 0 s 0 s 1 s 1 which shows that the definition 97 does indeed not depend on the choice of the distinguished section s 0 the formula in 2 is verified by the same homotopy argument as in 1 in the special situation x of no boundary the map f o hndr x r is defined by f o sf s for hndr x if n is equal to the index of the sc fredholm section f and zero otherwise 233 6 7 appendix 6 7 1 proof of lemma 6 5 proof of lemma 6 5 recalling the exact sequence e 0 a b c d 0 we choose linear subspaces v b and w c such that b a v and c b w and denote this choice of subspaces by v w the maps v v b and w w d are isomorphisms and b v by exactness fixing the basis a 1 an of a and d 1 dl of d we choose any basis b 1 bm n of v b and define the basis c 1 cm n of b c by ci v bi and define the basis c 1 c l of w by w c i di in order to show that the vector a 1 an b 1 bm n c 1 c l c 1 cm n does not depend on the choice of the basis b 1 bm n of v we choose a second basis b 1 bm n of v so that there is a linear isomorphism v v mapping one basis into the other by b b hence b 1 bm n det b 1 bm n where det is the usual determinant of the linear map the associated basis c 1 cm n of b is then defined by ci v bi the two basis ci and ci of b are therefore related by the isomorphism v 1 v b b and consequently c 1 cm n det v 1 v c 1 cm n det c 1 cm n from this we obtain a 1 an b 1 bm n c 1 c l c 1 cm n det a 1 an b 1 bm n 1 det c 1 c l c 1 cm n 234 so that the basis change has indeed no influence next we replace the basis a 1 an of a by the basis a 1 an by means of the linear isomorphism a a and replace the basis d 1 dl of d by the basis d 1 d l by means of the isomorphism d d then a 1 an d 1 dl det det a 1 an d 1 dl and the vector a 1 an d 1 dl is independent of the choices of the basis if and only if det det so far the definition of e could only depend on the choice of the complements v w so we assume that v w and v w are two choices we assume that a 1 an and d 1 dl are fixed bases for a and d respectively now fixing any basis b 1 bm n of v we find vectors q 1 qm n of a such that b 1 bm n with bi bi qi is a basis of v we define ci w by w ci di then we choose pi c so that ci ci pi w and w ci di now we use the fact that for v w and v w other choices do not matter using that qj is a linear combination of a 1 an and pj a linear combination of c 1 c l it follows that a 1 an b 1 bm n c 1 c l c 1 cm n a 1 an b 1 bm n c 1 c l c 1 cm n which completes the proof that e is well defined 6 7 2 proof of proposition 6 12 proof of proposition 6 12 let p q t p q and recall the exact se quence e t q 0 ker t j q t ker qt q t f r q q t coker t 0 by definition of the determinant h det t is of the form h a 1 an d 1 r t dl r t where a 1 an is a basis of ker t and d 1 r t dl r t is a basis of f r t satisfying di r i q the latter condition can be achieved since by definition of t r qt r q we choose the vectors b 1 bm 235 in ker qt so that a 1 an b 1 bm form a basis of ker qt and take the linearly independent vectors t b 1 r q t bm r q in f r q by definition of the isomorphism q t dett det qt q t h a 1 an b 1 bm d 1 r q dl r q t b 1 r q t bm r q we note that t a 1 t an 0 and qt b 1 qt bm 0 98 next we consider the exact sequence 0 ker qt jp qt ker pt p qt f r p p qt coker qt 0 in order to compute pqt q t h we take as basis of ker qt the vectors a 1 an b 1 bm and as basis of f r q the vectors d 1 r q dl r q t b 1 r q t bm r q since ker qt ker pt we choose the vectors b 1 b k in ker pt so that a 1 an b 1 bm b 1 b k form a basis of ker pt we define p a 1 an b 1 bm b 1 b k and note that pqt di r p i p di r q di r q the vectors d 1 r p dl r p t b 1 r p t bm r p qt b 1 r p qt bk r p are a basis of f r p and we abbreviate their wedge product by p so that pqt q t h p p recall that di i q di and i q t bi t bi for i 1 m abbreviating d d r p the projectionq f f induces the projection q f r p f r p defined by d 7 qd then i q d i q d and therefore f r p ker q ker i q 236 the vectors d 1 dl t b 1 t bm ker q qt b 1 qt bk ker i q form a basis for f r p by the standard properties of the wedge product p d 1 dl t b 1 t bm qt b 1 qt bk d 1 dl t b 1 t bm t b 1 t bk hence we arrive for the composition pqt q t at the formula pqt q t h p d 1 dl t b 1 t bm t b 1 t bk next we compute pt h in order to do so we start with the basis a 1 an of ker t and extend it to a basis of ker pt by choosing b 1 bm b 1 b k the wedge of all these vectors is q for f r t we have the basis d 1 r t dl r t recall that i q di di so that di ker q further pt di r p i p di r t i p i q di r t i q di r t di r t then we take the basis of f r p formed with the previous convention by the vectors d 1 dl t b 1 t bm t b 1 t bk and note that their wedge product is equal to p by definition pt h p p which agrees with pqt q t h the proof of proposition 6 12 complete 237 references 1 peter albers a simple example
