representative of that class topological conclusions from the study of harmonic maps in given homotopy classes were drawn for instance by r schoen and s t yau in 39 40 41 for p harmonic maps with 1 p connections to higher homotopy groups as well as to homotopy classes of maps arise see e g 46 38 45 from early on in the work of various authors such as eells and sampson 10 it has been noted that certain methods of obtaining existence results for harmonic maps in homotopy classes are restricted to the setting of non positively curved target manifolds see the survey article 9 for further discussion some results such as in the papers 5 47 of burstall and white have been obtained for the existence regularity and more rarely uniqueness of harmonic and p harmonic maps between general riemannian manifolds with varying assumptions more recently p harmonic maps between general riemannian manifolds have been studied in 38 25 45 to mention but a few towards a nonsmooth theory the assumption of some sort of nonpositive curva ture on the target space seems to become compulsory starting with gromov s and schoen s work 13 continued in 34 a theory of harmonic maps from a riemann ian manifold or riemannian polyhedron in 8 to a nonpositively curved metric space in the sense of alexandrov see section 1 2 below was built jost in a series of papers 27 28 29 studied harmonic maps from metric spaces with a doubling measure and a poincare inequality to metric spaces of nonpositive curvature this setting is closest to ours with basically the same assumptions we proceed to de fine and study homotopy classes using tools coming from analysis in metric spaces more of which in section 1 1 below 1 1 main results the present paper may be divided into two parts in the first we focus mainly on general properties of homotopies in the setting sobolev type maps between metric spaces the second part is concerned with compactness properties and existence of energy minimizers in homotopy classes a new approach for proving these in the metric setting is proposed but we are unable to complete it we work in the setting of metric spaces the domain x d is always assumed to be a complete metric space with a doubling measure supporting a weak 1 p poincare inequality see definition 1 2 and the target y d a complete separable geodesic space in the second part we will assume in addition that the target is a locally convex space see definition 1 17 first part sections 1 4 more precisely in the first part we work in the framework of the dirichlet classes d 1 p x y of maps between metric spaces with p 1 we introduce two distinct topologies on d 1 p x y and two notions of homotopy for maps in d 1 p x y the precise definitions are given in subsection 1 2 def initions 1 8 and 1 9 and in subsection 2 1 definitions 2 1 and 2 2 respectively but we briefly explain the main idea of the definitions here topologies the standard topology refers to the topology on d 1 p x y induced by the seminorms u d 1 p y u pd x gpud 1 p homotopy classes of newtonian spaces 3 where ranges over the domains of x with compact closure the ohta topology on d 1 p x y is in turn induced by the family of pseudometrics d u v dy u v d x gu gv pd 1 p ranging again over domains of x with compact closure in both cases if x is compact the above expressions with x yield a metric which generates the topologies homotopies two maps in the dirichlet class d 1 p x y are said to be path homo topic if they can be connected with a continuous path in d 1 p x y while we say they are p quasihomotopic if they are homotopic outside sets of arbitrarily small p capacity the two different topologies on d 1 p x y give rise to two distinct notions of path homotopy see definitions 2 1 and 2 2 the first part of the paper is largely devoted to the relationship between the two notions of homotopy we summarise the main findings below theorem 1 1 x d is a complete space with a doubling measure supporting a weak 1 p poincare inequality and y a separable complete locally convex metric space if two maps u v d 1 p x y are p quasihomotopic they may be connected by continuous path in the ohta topology of d 1 p x y theorem 1 2 suppose x d is a complete space with a doubling measure supporting a weak 1 p poincare inequality and y a separable complete geodesic space let u v d 1 p x y and h 0 1 d 1 p x y be a map connecting u and v i e h 0 u h 1 v suppose that there exists a constant c and for every compact k x some ck 0 so that gdy ht hs lp x c t s and k dy ht hs d ck t s for all t s 0 1 then u and v are p quasihomotopic in particular we have the following corollary corollary 1 3 let x and y be as in theorem 1 2 and assume in addition that x is compact suppose that u v n 1 p x y can be joined by a rectifiable curve in n 1 p x y in the standard metric then u and v are p quasihomotopic for riemannian manifolds we have the following result theorem 1 4 let m n be smooth compact riemannian manifolds if two maps u v w 1 p m n are p quasihomotopic then they are path homotopic the converse does not necessarily hold as is demonstrated by an example in section 4 concerning the different topologies we have the following result proposition 1 5 let m n be smooth compact riemannian manifolds then d 1 p m n w 1 p m n and the standard and ohta topologies on w 1 p m n agree 4 elefterios soultanis second part sections 5 6 the initial main goal in this paper was to prove the stability of p quasihomotopy classes under lp convergence in the spirit of 47 such a result would imply existence of energy minimizing maps in a given homotopy class indeed the latter part of the paper develops a new approach for establishing the stability result existence of energy minimizers in homotopy classes has been studied in 47 34 11 12 as well as in 3 19 but the methods in these papers are specific to the manifold setting in particular the works 11 12 fill in a gap in the proofs of existence of energy minimizers in 8 our approach is based on the following characterization of p quasihomotopy in terms of lifts to the diagonal cover see section 4 for the definition of the diagonal cover theorem 1 6 let x d be a complete space with a doubling measure sup porting a weak 1 p poincare inequality and suppose y is a separable complete locally convex space two maps u v d 1 p x y are p quasihomotopic if and only if the product map u v d 1 p x y y admits a lift h d 1 p x y diag with respect to the diagonal covering map y diag y y see also 43 theorem 1 2 to describe our approach fix a map v d 1 p x y with both x and y compact denote the set of maps u d 1 p x y p quasihomotopic to v by v the covering 0 1 y diag y y induces a map d 1 p x y diag d 1 p x y given by h 1 h by theorem 1 6 u v if and only there is a map h d 1 p x y diag such that h u v therefore restricts to a map hv v where hv h d 1 p x y diag 0 h v the strategy is to view the restricted map as a covering map and hu as a covering space under the appropriate technical assumptions the stability result would follow from the fact that hv is a proper metric space proven in section 5 v is known to be precompact the rellich kondrakov theorem and is a covering map however i have been unable to prove this last part and this inability comes from a lack of knowledge concerning the metric geometry of the space n 1 p x y the problem which is essentially the existence of a convergent subsequence of lifts stems from the same difficulty that is present in 8 corrected in 11 12 the numerous details of this ultimately failed attempt are presented in sections 5 and 6 it nevertheless seemed reasonable to communicate the partial results obtained along the way in hope of encouraging future research for a better understanding of the metric properties of newtonian classes of maps and for the existence of minimizers of a suitable energy in homotopy classes in this general setting outline the paper is organized as follows homotopy classes of newtonian spaces 5 section 1 in the first and second subsections on the introduction relevant facts on analysis on metric spaces are presented subsection 1 2 contains the defini tions of the newtonian and dirichlet classes and the standard and ohta topologies poincare inequalities and p quasicontinuity are presented in subsection 1 3 the fourth subsection serves as a brief review of the basics of nonpositively curved spaces both the definition of alexandrov and that of busemann are presented and briefly discussed section 2 in the second section we focus on two different notions of homotopy the definitions of each being given in subsection 2 1 some properties of each are exhibited and the relationship between the different notions is studied theorem 1 1 follows immediately from theorems 2 3 and 2 2 as explained in remark 2 12 in subsection 2 2 the proof of theorem 1 2 is given in subsection 2 3 section 3 the third section is devoted to lifts of homotopies the construction and some properties of the diagonal covering map y diag y y is given in subsection 3 1 subsection 3 2 contains the proof of theorem 1 6 in two parts propositions 3 3 and 3 4 see remark 3 5 section 4 the fourth section covers the manifold case recalling the necessary concepts of p 1 homotopy and some useful lemmas the proof of theorem 1 4 is presented in subsection 4 2 as well as a counterexample to the converse statement of theorem 1 4 and the brief proof of proposition 1 5 sections 5 and 6 the fifth and sixth sections form the second part of the paper concerned with the stability of p quasihomotopy classes under lp convergence in the fifth section the details of the approach to the stability of p quasihomotopy classes are explained while the sixth section presents a weak compactness result and discusses some open problems and possible future research directions notation and convention throughout this paper the notation fa a fd 1 a a fd will be used for the average of a locally integrable function f over the measurable set a with positive measure the centered maximal function is denoted by mrf x sup 0 r r b x r fd for a number 0 the dilated ball b of a open or closed ball b b x r is b b x r the length of a path joining two points x y z in a metric space is the following sup n k 1 dz ak ak 1 a a 0 a 1 an b in general this quantity may be infinite paths for which are called rectifiable a rectifiable path can always be affinely reparametrized so that 0 1 y and d t s t s t s for all t s 0 1 t s see 37 proposition 2 2 9 we will call this the constant speed parametrization of a rectifiable path 6 elefterios soultanis if not otherwise stated we will always regard rectifiable curves in a metric space z as being maps 0 1 z 1 2 upper gradients newtonian and dirichlet classes of maps a metric measure space is a locally compact metric space x d equipped with a borel regular measure with the property that 0 b for all open balls b x we say that the metric measure space is doubling if the measure is doubling i e there is a constant 0 c such that b x 2 r c b x r for all balls b x r x with r diamx note the difference to saying that a metric space is doubling which means that for some fixed number n any ball can be covered with at most n balls of half the radius note that these are distinct notions for instance q is a doubling metric space but does not support a doubling measure for details on the relationship of the two notions see 15 21 let u x y be a map between metric spaces a non negative borel function g x 0 is said to be an upper gradient of u if for every rectifiable curve with endpoints x and y we have the inequality 1 1 dy u x u y gds the p modulus of a path family is defined as modp inf x pd 0 borel and 1 a family of rectifiable curves a b x has zero p modulus if there exists a non negative borel function h lp so that h see 15 24 21 for the definition of the path integral if u x y is a map and g x 0 a borel function so that 1 1 is satisfied for all curves except a curve family that has zero p modulus we say that g is a p weak upper gradient of u upper gradients and their p weak counterparts enable us to define a concept of p capacity of subsets of x analogously with the classical p capacities let x d be a metric measure space e x a subset and p 1 the sobolev p capacity of the set e is defined by capp e inf x u p gp d g an upper gradient for u s t u 1 on e let p be a defined pointwise property we say that p holds p quasieverywhere if the set where p fails to hold has p capacity zero a condenser is a pair of subsets e where e and is open the p capacity of a condenser is defined by capp e inf gpd u 1 on e u 0 on x homotopy classes of newtonian spaces 7 where g is an upper gradient of u as we shall see this concept will play an important role for us more information on p capacities equivalent notions and variants can be found for instance in 33 1 maps with locally integrable upper gradients to study maps between metric spaces we adopt the framework used in 24 let x d be a metric measure space and v a banach space with the lipschitz extension property that is given any metric space z each l lipschitz map f a v from an arbitrary subset a z may be extended to a cl lipschitz map f x v with constant c independent of z a and f examples of such spaces are v r and v a map u x v is measurable if u 1 u is measurable for every open set u v it is essentially separably valued if there is a set n x with n 0 so that u x n is a separable subset of v see 24 chapter 2 for a detailed discussion of banach space valued lp spaces the dirichlet class d 1 p x v consists of measurable maps u x v which have a p integrable p weak upper gradient g 1 since for any p weak upper gradient g of u not necessarily p integrable there is a sequence gk of upper gradients such that gk g lp x 0 1 lemma 1 46 it follows that the requirement of u having a p integrable p weak upper gradient is equivalent to requiring that u has a p integrable upper gradient minimal p weak upper gradients as in 1 section 2 2 or 23 chapters 7 and 8 it can be seen that the set gu g lp x g is a p weak upper gradient for u is a closed and convex lattice if p 1 it follows that there is a unique minimal element gu in the sense that for all g gu one has gu g almost everywhere we arrive at the following 1 theorem 2 5 theorem 1 7 for p 1 every map u d 1 p x v has a unique minimal p integrable p weak upper gradient denoted gu local newtonian classes we say that a map u x v belongs to the local newtonian class n 1 p loc x v if u is locally p integrable and possesses a p weak upper gradient g lploc x while the newtonian class n 1 p x v consists of maps u lp x v with a p weak upper gradient g lp x maps with metric space target let y be a complete metric space recall the kuratowski embedding y y where we send a point y y to the function dy de here e y is a fixed point and dy x d x y we define the classes n 1 p loc x y u n 1 p loc x y u x y for p quasievery x x d 1 p x y u d 1 p x y u x y for p quasievery x x n 1 p x y u n 1 p x y u x y for p quasievery x x we will mainly concern ourselves with d 1 p x y 1 it is implicitly understood that maps u v which agree outside a set of p capacity zero are identified similarly to the usual lp theory 8 elefterios soultanis definition 1 8 the family of seminorms u p d 1 p y u pd x gpud for domains x with compact closure gives rise to a topology on d 1 p x y the restriction of this topology to d 1 p x y is called the standard topology on d 1 p x y this way d 1 p x y becomes a closed subspace of d 1 p x y clearly uj u as j in the standard topology if and only if u uj d 1 p y 0 as j for all domains x with compact closure there is also a different topology we may put on d 1 p x y we define it next definition 1 9 the topology on d 1 p x y induced by the family of pseudometrics d u v dy u v d x gu gv pd 1 p with domain x with compact closure is called the ohta topology the topology defined above is based on the notion used by ohta in 36 section 4 with d u v lp replaced by d u v l 1 since gu gv gu v almost everywhere we see that convergence in the standard topology implies convergence in the ohta topology note that if x is compact the expressions u d 1 p v and d for x define metrics on d 1 p x y n 1 p x y in such a case we call these the standard and ohta metric respectively in general the ohta metric is not complete see subsection 4 2 1 3 poincare inequalities and its consequences an analytic way of imposing a condition that ties the geo metric properties of x and the behaviour of the measure is to require that upper gradients also control the behaviour of maps in some integral average sense this is done by the poincare inequality we say that a metric measure space x d supports a weak 1 p poincare inequality if whenever u x r is locally integrable and g x 0 is a locally integrable upper gradient of u the inequality 1 2 b u ub d c diam b b gpd 1 p is satisfied with constants c independent of u g and b the constants c in the poincare inequality and the doubling constant of the measure will be referred to as the data of the space x by now doubling metric measure spaces supporting a weak 1 p poincare in equality are known to enjoy many geometric as well as analytic properties we will only mention some of these that are relevant to this paper there are numerous sources on the subject and the interested reader is referred to 22 35 6 24 42 16 21 32 15 23 1 to name a few we record the following useful theorem from 24 theorem 4 3 homotopy classes of newtonian spaces 9 theorem 1 10 suppose x d is a complete doubling metric measure space then x supports a weak 1 p poincare inequality for p 1 if and only if it supports a weak 1 p poincare inequality for v valued maps for any banach space v i e if there are constants c 1 such that for every locally integrable map u x v and every upper gradient g of u the inequality b u ub v d c r b gpd 1 p holds for all balls b b x r the constants c and then depend only on p and the data of x measurability and local p integrability in the definition of d 1 p x v no local in tegrability assumption is made for a function u d 1 p x v itself however the inequality u 1 v u 0 v u 1 u 0 v g remains true without any measurability assumptions and implies that a p weak upper gradient g of u is also a p weak upper gradient for the function x 7 u x v from 26 theorem 1 11 we have the following theorem 1 11 if x d supports a weak 1 p poincare inequality and f x is a function that has a p integrable upper gradient then f is mea surable and locally p integrable applying this to f u v we see that in fact x 7 u x v is measurable see 24 and locally p integrable thus if u is essentially separably valued the existence of a p integrable p weak upper gradient implies both measurability and local p integrability of u remark 1 12 regarding the minimal p weak upper gradient of a locally lipschitz map u x v with x d a doubling metric measure space supporting a weak 1 p poincare inequality we note that there is a constant c depending only on the data of x such that lipu cgu almost everywhere to see this we simply note that keith s proof of his result 31 proposition 4 3 3 lipu x c lim sup r 0 1 r b x r u ub d almost everywhere applies to lipschitz maps with a banach space target from this our claim follows by a straightforward application of the poincare inequality lim sup r 0 1 r b x r u ub d c lim sup r 0 b x r gpud 1 p cgu x almost everywhere when the target is a locally compact cat 0 space y which is locally geodesically complete see section 1 2 below it is proven in 36 corollary 5 10 that lipu gu for locally lipschitz maps u x y 10 elefterios soultanis p quasicontinuity it follows from the properties of the p modulus modp and the definition of p weak upper gradients that given u d 1 p x v there exists a curve family with modp 0 so that if then u b u a v a b gu a b 0 1 in particular u is absolutely continuous along p almost every curve for us a crucial continuity property is the following concept of p quasicontinuity a map u x v is said to be p quasicontinuous if for every 0 there exists an open set e x with capp e such that u x e x e v is continuous lemma 1 13 suppose x d is a proper metric measure space supporting a weak 1 p poincare inequality then every map u n 1 ploc x v is p quasicontinuous proof since p quasicontinuity is a local property the claim is implied immediately by 24 corollary 6 8 remark 1 14 we will often use the following equivalent formulation of p qua sicontinuity there is a decreasing sequence en en 1 of open sets in x with capp en 2 n such that u x en is continuous indeed using p quasicontinuity to select open sets ek with capp e k 2 k such that u x ek is continuous the sets en k n ek satisfy the conditions of this alternative formulation if uk k d is a countable collection of maps in n 1 p loc x v we may by a sim ilar procedure produce a decreasing sequence en en 1 of open sets so that capp en 2 n and uk x en is continuous for all k d n n next we state the rellich kondrakov theorem and another useful result theorem 1 15 rellich kondrakov let x be a doubling metric measure space supporting a weak 1 p poincare inequality and y a proper metric space if uj is a sequence in n 1 p loc x y and v n 1 p loc x y with sup j b dy v uj pd 5 b gpujd for a given ball b x then there is a subsequence denoted by the same indices and u n 1 p b y so that uj u lp b y 0 as j and moreover b gpud lim inf j b gpujd proof note that the assumptions imply for q y sup j b dy uj q pd 5 b gpujd sup j 2 p 1 b dy v uj pd 2 p 1 b dy v q pd 5 b gpujd homotopy classes of newtonian spaces 11 we have the scalar valued case of the claim by 16 theorem 8 3 using the argument presented in the proof of 34 theorem 1 3 we may reduce the claim to the scalar valued case and hence we are done lemma 1 16 suppose fn is a sequence in d 1 p x v and fn f in lploc x v if gn is a sequence of p weak upper gradients of fn and gn g weakly in lp x then there is f d 1 p x v so that f f almost everywhere and g is a p integrable p weak upper gradient for f moreover if f d 1 p x y then we may choose f f proof by mazur s lemma 1 lemma 6 1 a sequence of convex combinations of the gn s converge to g in norm in particular we may choose the convex combinations so that the jth element is a convex combination of gj gj 1 gj 2 the corre sponding sequence of convex combinations of the fn s converges to f in l p loc x v and therefore by the proof of 30 lemma 3 1 see also 1 proposition 2 3 g is a p weak upper gradient for a representative f of f the p integrability is obvious the last assertion follows from the proof of 1 proposition 2 3 1 4 spaces of nonpositive curvature busemann and alexandrov let us mention to start with that of the two notions of nonpositive curvature busemann s and alexandrov s the more widely used is the notion given by alexandrov how ever we shall use busemann s definition of nonpositive curvature for the simple reason that the nature of the methods used in this paper corresponds quite natu rally to the notions used in busemann s definition a central theme in the theory of spaces of nonpositive curvature both buse mann s and alexandrov s is convexity recall that a geodesic joining two points x y y in a metric space is a path satisfying d x y a geodesic can always be constant speed parametrized so that 0 1 y and d t s t s for all t s 0 1 see 37 proposition 2 2 9 we call a path connected metric space y d locally complete and geodesic if each point has a closed neighbourhood that is a complete geodesic space definition 1 17 a a metric space y is called a busemann space if it is locally complete and geodesic and for every pair of affinely reparametrized geodesics 0 1 y the distance map t 7 d t t 0 1 r is convex b a metric space y is locally convex if each point has a neighbourhood that is a busemann space with the induced metric such neighbourhoods are called busemann convex neighbourhoods note that many authors define local convexity by considering geodesics with common starting point see for instance 4 chapter ii 4 however this seemingly weaker notion of local convexity is easily seen to be equivalent to the definition presented here to speak about alexandrov s notion of nonpositive curvature we need to introduce the concept of geodesic triangles and comparison triangles 12 elefterios soultanis let y be a locally complete and geodesic space a geodesic triangle y con sists of three points x y z y and affinely reparametrized geodesics xy xz yz connecting x with y x with z and y with z respectively a comparison triangle r 2 is a euclidean triangle with vertices x y z such that the side lengths agree i e x y d x y x z d x z y z d y z for any geodesic triangle a comparison triangle always exists 4 lemma i 2 14 given this the notion of a comparison point to w is self explanatory definition 1 18 a a complete geodesic space y is said to be of global non positive curvature if for all geodesic triangles with comparison triangle and any two points a b the comparison points a b satisfy d a b a b b a locally complete and geodesic space is said to be of nonpositive curvature an npc space for short if each point has a closed neighbourhood that is a space of global nonpositive curvature when equipped with the inherited metric in the literature one often encounters the name cat 0 space for spaces of global nonpositive curvature in intuitive terms a globally nonpositively curved space is one where geodesic tri angles are thinner than their corresponding euclidean comparison triangles one sees from the two definitions that alexandrov s does not directly pertain to con vexity whereas busemann s definition does it is however true that a nonpositively curved space is locally convex and similarly for the global notions the converse fails to hold and so the class of locally convex spaces is strictly larger than that of nonpositively curved ones in fact a banach space is of global nonpositive curvature if and only if its norm comes from an inner product in contrast a banach space is a busemann space if and only if its unit ball is strictly convex for a good account of convexity in normed spaces see 37 chapters 7 and 8 and also 4 chapter 4 the difference between the two notions is that in alexandrov s definition the points a b are allowed to be arbitrary while busemann s definition only allows one to compare certain pairs of points without changing the comparison triangle ones that are of the form a t b t for some and the same t for both let us mention the following result due to alexandrov from which the convexity of a globally nonpositively curved space follows 44 cor 2 5 proposition 1 19 let y be a space of global nonpositive curvature and let 0 1 y be two affinely reparametrized geodesics then for all t 0 1 the inequality d 2 t t td 2 1 1 1 t d 2 0 0 t 1 t d 1 0 d 1 0 2 1 3 holds in particular the metric d y y r is convex whence y is a busemann space corollary 1 20 a nonpositively curved space y is also locally convex homotopy classes of newtonian spaces 13 the main reason for interest in locally convex spaces is the validity of a strong local to global principle below is a very general notion of this see 4 the cartan hadamard theorem 4 1 p 193 but the punchline of the principle is that a simply connected locally convex metric space is globally convex i e a busemann space and similarly for the nonpositive curvature case theorem 1 21 let y be a locally convex space then y admits a universal covering y with a unique metric with the properties that the covering map y y is a local isometry and y is a busemann space if y is of nonpositive curvature in the sense of alexandrov then the universal cover is a cat 0 space in fact the universal covering space may be constructed as follows take any q y and consider the set y q consisting of all constant speed parametrized local geodesics 0 1 y starting at q i e 0 q the map pq y q y given by pq 1 is a covering map and the metric of y pulls back under pq to produce a length metric dq on y q such that the claims of theorem 1 21 are valid for details see 4 chapter ii 4 the proof of theorem 1 21 relies in large part on the following lemma which along with its refinement 1 23 will be of independent use for us for a reference see 4 lemma 4 3 p 194 lemma 1 22 suppose y is a locally convex space x y x let x b x y b y 0 1 y a constant speed parametrized local geodesic joining x and y with 0 such that b t 2 is busemann convex for all t then there exists a unique constant speed parametrized local geodesic 0 1 y joining x with y so that 1 4 t 7 d t t is a convex function moreover satisfies d x x d y y in particular d t t for each t 0 1 we shall require a sharpening of lemma 1 22 a proof of which can be found in 37 theorem 9 2 4 lemma 1 23 refinement of lemma 1 22 suppose x y y 0 and are as in the previous lemma u v b x and u v b y if and are the unique local geodesics provided by lemma 1 22 connecting u with u and v with v respectively then the unique local geodesic connecting v and v with respect to provided by lemma 1 22 is also a remark we will use without further mention in the sequel is the following if are two local geodesics with sup 0 t 1 dy t t and 0 is such that b t 2 is busemann convex for all t 0 1 then t 7 dy t t is convex this is true since for each t there is a small neighbourhood where and are both geodesics in the busemann convex space by t 2 and thus the distance function dy is convex near t 14 elefterios soultanis another particular consequence of theorem 1 21 is a uniqueness property for homotopy classes of paths in locally convex spaces here we give a formulation identical to 37 corollary 9 3 3 apart from the local compactness assumption made there for non locally compact spaces the proof of this proposition is included in the proof of 4 corollary 4 7 p 197 proposition 1 24 let y be a complete locally convex space then each continu ous path in y is endpoint preserving homotopic to a local geodesic unique up to reparametrization 2 homotopies now we introduce a notion of homotopy for p quasicontinuous maps generalizing the classical one this so called p quasihomotopy is then compared to a different notion appearing in 3 18 19 the notion p quasihomotopy utilizes the geometric structure of the target space whereas the second notion path homotopy which is stated for maps in the dirichlet class in fact relies on the topology of that class 2 1 p quasihomotopy and path homotopy throughout this section x stands for a complete doubling metric measure space x d supporting a weak 1 p poincare inequality for some p 1 which will be fixed for the rest of the paper in the definitions below y stands for a complete separable metric space completeness ensures that d 1 p x y is closed and separability ensures that maps in d 1 p x y are essentially separably valued by the remark after theorem 1 11 it is therefore always enough to find a p integrable p weak upper gradient for a map in order to show it is in d 1 p x y we shall gradually add assumptions on the target space y definition 2 1 let u v x y be p quasicontinuous we say that u and v are p quasihomotopic if there exists a map h x 0 1 y with the following property for every 0 there exists an open set e x with capp e such that hx e 0 1 is a usual homotopy between u x e and v x e the notion of p quasihomotopy is in the spirit of 34 where homotopy of maps into nonpositively curved spaces is studied explicit emphasis is given to the topol ogy structure of the target space instead of the topology of the sobolev or in our case newtonian space it is noteworthy that for p q log 2 c the p capacity capp becomes trivial in the sense that capp a 0 if and only if a therefore for these values of p the notions of p quasihomotopy and usual homotopy agree this is natural in view of the sobolev embedding theorem 24 theorem 6 2 which states that newtonian maps for p q are in fact 1 p q ho lder continuous to talk about path homotopy one needs to specify the topology used ind 1 p x y if not otherwise stated d 1 p x y will be equipped with the standard topology definition 2 2 we say that u v d 1 p x y are path homotopic if there exists a continuous path h c 0 1 d 1 p x y connecting u and v this definition appears in 3 where much more concerning it can be found see also 2 18 19 and the references therein the study of path homotopy classes is equivalent to the study of path components of the dirichlet space d 1 p x y homotopy classes of newtonian spaces 15 we shall see that a path homotopy satisfying certain rectifiability assumptions can always be modified to become a p quasihomotopy conversely a locally geodesic p quasihomotopy between maps with locally convex target defines a path in the dirichlet class between the endpoint maps but continuity must be taken with respect to the ohta topology such a p quasihomotopy even satisfies some local rectifiability assumptions a first result reflects the geometric structure of the target space y in the p quasihomotopies between maps given a p quasihomotopy h u v denote ht x y ht x h x t hx 0 1 y hx t h x t theorem 2 3 suppose y is a complete locally convex space and let u v x y be p quasicontinuous and p quasihomotopic given a p quasihomotopy h u v there exists a p quasihomotopy h u v unique in the following sense for p quasievery x x the path hx is the unique local geodesic between u x and v x belonging to the homotopy class of h x remark 2 4 a such a p quasihomotopy is called locally geodesic sometimes for brevity the word locally is omitted this does not mean that the paths hx are geodesic b we use the notation h u v to signify that h is a p quasihomotopy between the maps u and v proof to prove the claim let h u v be a p quasihomotopy for p a e x set h x t x t where x is the unique constant speed parametrized local geodesic in the homotopy class of x x t h x t given by proposition 1 24 it suffices to prove that h is a p quasihomotopy to this end let 0 be arbitrary and let e be an open set such that capp e and h x e 0 1 is a usual homotopy u x e v x e we shall show that hx e 0 1 is also a usual homotopy note in particular that by the choice of e the maps h 0 x e u x e and h 1 x e v x e are continuous if x x e and 0 are given let 0 be such that b h t x 0 and b x t 2 0 are busemann convex for all t 0 1 by the continuity of h x e 0 1 we may find r 0 such that h t b x r e b h t x 0 for all t 0 1 for y b x r e let be the unique local geodesic with 0 u y 1 v y guaranteed by lemmata 1 22 and 1 23 such that t 7 d x t t is convex then is necessarily homotopic to y yxu x xyv yxu x xyv y here xyu is the geodesic from u x to u y and yx v the geodesic from v y to v x the last homotopy follows since for all t the points y t belong to the busemann convex ball b x t 0 by the choices of y and 16 elefterios soultanis this shows that in fact y by uniqueness and from the estimates in lemma 1 22 we have for y z b x r e dy ht y ht z tdy v y v z 1 t dy u y u z and dy ht z hs z t s z t s x dy u x u z dy v x v z these estimates prove the continuity of h x e 0 1 theorem 2 5 suppose y is a separable complete locally convex space if h u v is a locally geodesic p quasihomotopy between two p quasicontinuous maps u v x y then it satisfies the following convexity estimate whenever x x and 0 is such that b ht x 2 is a convex ball for all t 0 1 y z x satisfy max 0 t 1 dy ht x ht y and max 0 t 1 dy ht x ht z we have dy ht y ht z tdy v y v z 1 t dy u y u z 2 1 hy hz dy u y u z dy v y v z 2 2 here hw denotes the local geodesic t 7 ht w w x proof the paths 1 t 7 ht y and 2 t 7 ht z are local geodesics for each t 0 0 1 there is a neighbourhood u t 0 such that 1 u and 2 u are geodesics in the busemann space b ht 0 x 2 and thus the function dy ht y ht z dy 1 t 2 t is convex in u therefore it is convex in 0 1 proving 2 1 to prove 2 2 we may assume without loss of generality that hy hz let be the local geodesic from u y to v z guaranteed by lemmata 1 22 and 1 23 then by the convexity of dy h y and the local geodesic property we have for small t 0 t hy dy u y ht y dy 0 ht y dy 0 t dy t ht y t tdy v z v y the same argument for the inverse paths 1 and hz 1 yields t 1 t hz 1 tdy u z u y cancelling out t and moving hz hz 1 to the other side we obtain 2 2 2 2 p quasihomotopies as paths in the dirichlet class we may view a p quasihomotopy h u v as gliding the map u to v through the path t 7 ht in a quasicontinuous manner our aim in this subsection is to develop this view and study p quasihomotopies as paths in the dirichlet class d 1 p x y to pass from pointwise information to paths in the dirichlet class we need sufficiently good geometric behaviour from the target space we continue assuming that x d is a complete doubling metric measure space supporting a weak 1 p poincare inequality and y is a complete and separable locally convex space see subsection 1 4 the following stronger version of 1 proposition 1 48 will prove very useful for us lemma 2 6 let en x be a sequence of sets with n capp en converging to zero denote 1 en 6 n homotopy classes of newtonian spaces 17 then modp 0 proof let um be such that um em 1 um 0 and gm an upper gradient of um with x um p gpm 2 m since m 0 we have um 0 in n 1 p x as m consequently we may pass to a subsequence umk converging to zero outside a set f of p capacity zero and satisfying k 1 1 pmk for l 1 set l k l gmk then x p l d 1 p k l x gpmkd 1 p 2 k l 1 pmk denote by f the family of paths with the property that 1 f 6 then for f we have that for each k there exists tk 0 1 with tk emk while 0 f given l 1 we have for all k l the estimate umk 0 1 umk 0 umk tk gmk l taking k we have umk 0 0 whence l 1 this shows that modp f x p l d 2 p k l 1 pmk p 0 as l since by 1 proposition 1 48 we have modp f 0 it follows that modp modp f modp f 0 and the proof is complete theorem 2 7 let u v d 1 p x y and h u v be a locally geodesic p quasihomotopy then for t 0 1 we have ght tgv 1 t gu almost everywhere in particular ht d 1 p x y for all t proof let em em 1 be a sequence of open sets inx with capp em 2 m and h x em 0 1 continuous by lemma 2 6 and the fact that u and v are absolutely continuous on p almost every curve there is a curve family with modp 0 such that each satisfies 1 there exists m 0 so that 1 em 0 and consequently 1 em for every m m 0 18 elefterios soultanis 2 the inequalities dy u b u a a b gu dy v b v a a b gv hold for a b 0 1 fix such a and let k x em 0 since h k 0 1 is uniformly continuous there exists 0 so that b ht s 2 is convex for all t s 0 1 futhermore the uniform continuity implies the existence of 0 so that max 0 t 1 dy ht b ht a whenever a b by the estimate 2 1 we therefore have dy ht b ht a tdy v b v a 1 t dy u b u a a b tgv 1 t gu partitioning 0 1 into subintervals of length and applying the estimate above yields dy ht 1 ht 0 k dy ht ak ht ak 1 tgv 1 t gu this proves that tgv 1 t gu is a p weak upper gradient for ht and the claim follows lemma 2 8 suppose u v d 1 p x y and h u v is a locally geodesic p quasihomotopy define lh x r by lh x h x then lh d 1 p x and glh gu gv proof it suffices to prove the inequality for this let be as in the previous proof and fix by the reasoning in the previous proof we have the existence of 0 so that lh b lh a dy u b u a dy v b v a estimate 2 2 whenever a b a b 0 1 by the same partitioning argument we arrive at lh 1 lh 0 gu gv and this proves the claim corollary 2 9 in the situation of lemma 2 8 we have for each compact k x the inequality k d p y ht hs d t s p k l p hd consequently hs ht in lploc x y as s t homotopy classes of newtonian spaces 19 proof the inequality follows directly from the fact that dy ht x hs x t s hx t s lh x for p quasievery x x the second claim is immediate from the first and the fact that lh lploc x theorem 2 10 suppose h u v is a locally geodesic p quasihomotopy then the map 0 1 d 1 p x y given by t ht is a continuous path when d 1 p x y is equipped with the ohta topology proof from theorem 2 7 we have that t 7 ht is a map 0 1 d 1 p x y that hs ht in l 1 loc x y as s t follows from corollary 2 9 therefore we only need to focus on the convergence of the p weak upper gradients let t 0 1 we will show that the one sided limits exist and agree lim s t ghs ght lim s t ghs in the lp sense we will make use of the following well known fact about uniformly convex banach spaces fact 2 11 let v be a uniformly convex banach space xk converges weakly to x as k and further xk x then xk x in norm in fact it suffices to prove that ghs gu as s 0 this is because of the following the restriction h x t 1 is a p quasihomotopy between ht and v so by rescaling the parameter side we obtain a locally geodesic p quasihomotopy h ht v h x s h x t s 1 t so that lim s t ghs lim s 0 gh s to study lims t ghs we simply replace h by h ht u h x s h x t 1 s now to prove that lims 0 ghs gu in l p x take any sequence sk 0 since ghsk lp x sk gv lp x 1 sk gu lp x gv lp x gu lp x for all k the reflexivity of lp x implies that there is a subsequence denoted by the same indices converging to some g lp x whence g lp x lim inf k ghsk lp x on the other hand since hsk u in l p loc x y corollary 2 9 it follows by lemma 1 16 that g is a p weak upper gradient for u this and the convexity estimate together imply lim sup k ghsk lp x lim sup k sk gv lp x 1 sk gu lp x gu lp x g lp x 2 3 where the last inequality comes from the minimality of gu consequently ghsk lp x g lp x therefore ghsk g in norm 20 elefterios soultanis let us still prove that g gu from the fact that g is a p weak upper gradient for u it follows that gu g almost everywhere so it suffices to prove g lp x gu lp x this however follows immediately the above estimate 2 3 g lp x lim k ghsk lp x lim sup k ghsk lp x gu lp x altogether we have shown that for every sk 0 we have ghsk gu in l p x up to a subsequence therefore ghsk gu in l p x and the proof is complete remark 2 12 theorems 2 3 and 2 10 together imply that p quasihomotopic maps into locally convex targets are also path homotopic if d 1 p x y is equipped with the ohta topology to see this suppose u v d 1 p x y are p quasihomotopic by theorem 2 3 they may be connected by a locally geodesic p quasihomotopy theorem 2 10 then implies that u and v are path homotopic in the ohta topology 2 3 pointwise properties of path homotopies in this subsection we prove theorem 1 2 before that let us make some remaks remarks 1 we pose no control on the lp norms of dy ht hs 2 the conditions of the theorem are a sort of rectifiability requirement for the path h since gdy u v gu v almost everywhere the condition is implied if h is a rectifiable path h 0 1 d 1 p x y when d 1 p x y is equipped with the standard topology 3 note that gdy u v may vanish without the same being true of gu v think of maps u 0 rn and v taking values in sn 1 4 the relation between gdy u v and gu gv is not clear when y r we have gdy u v g u v gu v gu gv but the previous example shows that gdy u v may vanish without gu gv vanishing this question is related to the open question 1 2 13 5 the proof below yields a slightly stronger claim that theorem 2 3 a path satisfying the conditions may be modified by possibly changing its values in a negligible set each 0 1 slice of which has measure zero so that it becomes a p quasihomotopy proof of theorem 1 2 let dn k 2 n k 0 2 n and d n dn the dyadic rationals on the interval 0 1 we may find a sequence em em 1 of open subsets of x with capp em 2 m and hs x em continuous for all m n and s d for x e m em define ln x 2 n 1 1 p 2 n k 1 d p y hk 2 n x h k 1 2 n x 1 p and l x sup n ln x note that ln is pointwise increasing denoting dj n dj n dy hj 2 n h j 1 2 n homotopy classes of newtonian spaces 21 we have dj n d 2 j n 1 d 2 j 1 n 1 so that ln 2 n 1 1 p 2 n j 1 d p j n 1 p 2 n 1 1 p 2 n j 1 2 p 1 d p 2 j n 1 d p 2 j 1 n 1 1 p 2 n 1 1 1 p 2 n 1 j 1 d p j n 1 1 p ln 1 we shall use this notation throughout the proof of theorem 1 2 if we set p 1 in the definition of ln we are in fact measuring the length of the path d s 7 hs x the finiteness of this length however only guarantees that s 7 hs x is a sort of bv map the significance of l as defined above is shown by the next lemma lemma 2 13 if l x then the map d s 7 hs x extends to a 1 1 p ho lder continuous path denoted hx 0 1 y joining the points u x and v x with ho lder constant l x proof of lemma 2 13 let us define hx s for s d by hx s hs x for n n and j 1 2 n we have d p y h x j 2 n hx j 1 2 n 2 n p 1 ln x p 2 n p 1 l x p for k l 0 2 n l k the triangle inequality implies dy h x l 2 n hx k 2 n l j k 1 dy h x j 2 n hx j 1 2 n k j l dj n x we may use the ho lder inequality as follows k j l dj n x k j l 1 dj n x k j l 1 p p 1 1 1 p k j l dj n x p 1 p l k 1 1 p 2 n 1 1 p 2 n 1 1 p k j l dj n x p 1 p l k 2 n 1 1 p ln x if s t d we may write s k 2 n and t l 2 m assuming without loss of generality that n m we have t 2 n ml 2 n s k 2 n and putting the above estimates together yields dy h x t hx s t s 1 1 pln x t s 1 1 pl x this proves the claim the result is very much in the spirit of the sobolev embeddings by this analogy the need for p 1 in the definition of ln becomes apparent the rest of the proof is devoted to obtaining pointwise control over l we start with the following lemma 22 elefterios soultanis lemma 2 14 we have l lploc x and ln l pointwise everywhere further more the functions gn 2 n 1 1 p 2 n k 1 g p dy hk 2 n h k 1 2 n 1 p are p weak upper gradients for ln satisfying sup n gn lp x c where c is the constant in the assumption of the theorem proof of lemma 2 14 since ln n is a pointwise increasing sequence convergence everywhere follows by the monotone convergence theorem k lpd lim n k lpnd k x compact the poincare inequality for balls b x together with assumption of the theorem implies that b d p y ht hs d 1 p b dy ht hs d cr b g p dy ht hs d 1 p cb b t s cr b 1 p t s c b t s applying this to dk n dy hk 2 n h k 1 2 n we have b lpnd b 2 n p 1 2 n k 1 d p k nd 2 n p 1 2 n k 1 b d p k nd 2 n p 1 2 n k 1 b c b p 2 np b c b p for all n n and consequently l lploc x incidentally this implies that l x almost everywhere for the second claim fix a family of curves with modp 0 so that whenever the upper gradient inequality dk n x dk n y gdk n homotopy classes of newtonian spaces 23 is satisfied for these curves we may estimate ln x ln y 2 n 1 1 p 2 n k 1 d p k n x 1 p 2 n k 1 d p k n y 1 p 2 n 1 1 p 2 n k 1 dk n x dk n y p 1 p 2 n 1 1 p 2 n k 1 gdk n p 1 p the rightmost term may be estimated using the minkowski inequality in integral form 20 theorem 202 p 148 by 2 n 1 1 p 2 n k 1 g p dk n 1 p we arrive at ln x ln y gn to see the last part use the condition in the statement of the theorem to compute x gpnd 2 n p 1 2 n k 1 x g p dk n d 2 n p 1 2 n k 1 cp 2 np cp this completes the proof of lemma 2 14 since gn is bounded in l p x there is a subsequence converging weakly to some g lp x by mazur s lemma a sequence of convex combination of gn s converges to g in lp the corresponding sequence of convex combination of ln s converges everywhere to l and l almost everywhere therefore by 1 proposition 2 4 g is a p integrable p weak upper gradient of l we conclude that l d 1 p x in particular l is p quasicontinuous and finite p quasieverywhere define h x t hx t for every x x for which l x hx being the path from u x to v x given by lemma 2 13 let us prove that h is a p quasihomotopy to this end let fm fm 1 be a sequence of open sets in x with capp fm 2 m and l x fm continuous for m n set um em fm we claim that h x um 0 1 is a continuous homotopy between u x um and v x um for all m it is clear that h 0 u and h 1 v p quasieverywhere so only the continuity remains to be proven let xk x um tk 0 1 xk tk x t where x x um there is a compact set k x um containing all xk s and sup z k l z therefore the paths hxk are equicontinuous and pointwise bounded since hxk s hs xk hs x hx s s d by the arzela ascoli theorem hxk converges uniformly up to a subsequence to a path but since hxk hx pointwise in a 24 elefterios soultanis dense set d it follows that hx this argument shows that any subsequence of hxk has a further subsequence converging uniformly to hx from this it follows that hxk hx uniformly in particular hxk tk hx t as k the proof of theorem 1 2 is now complete corollary 2 15 suppose y is a locally convex space and h u v a locally geo desic p quasihomotopy then two maps u v d 1 p x y are p quasihomotopic if and only if there exists a path joining u and v satisfying the conditions of theorem 1 2 proof it is not difficult to see using the argument in the proofs of theorem 2 7 and lemma 2 8 that gdy ht hs t s glh this together with corollary 2 9 implies that a locally geodesic p quasihomotopy satisfies the conditions of theorem 1 2 the section is closed by the proof of corollary 1 3 proof of corollary 1 3 suppose h 0 1 n 1 p x y is a continuous rectifiable path joining u v n 1 p x y denote by h 0 1 n 1 p x y the constant speed parametrization of h the path h is lipschitz in the standard metric of n 1 p x y i e x dy h t h s pd 1 p x g p h t h s d 1 p c t s t s 0 1 by the inequality gdy h t h s gh t h s a e for any t s 0 1 we see that h satisfies the assumptions of theorem 1 2 the claim follows from this 3 lifting p quasihomotopies besides thinking of p quasihomotopies as paths in d 1 p x y there is another way of looking at them in this section we concentrate on this view which is reminiscent of lifting paths in covering space theory the aim is to view a locally geodesic p quasihomotopy h u v between two maps u v d 1 p x y as a single newtonian map with target space y diag a certain covering space of y y 3 1 the diagonal cover we start by constructing the diagonal covering space y diag and recalling some useful facts throughout this section x d stands for a complete doubling metric measure space supporting a weak 1 p poincare inequality let y be a locally convex space equip y 2 with the metric d 2 y 2 x 1 y 2 x 2 y 2 d 2 y x 1 x 2 d 2 y y 1 y 2 the product space y 2 remains a locally convex space and nonpositively curved in case y is nonpositively curved set y diag 0 1 y a constant speed local geodesic homotopy classes of newtonian spaces 25 with metric d max 0 t 1 dy t t the map y diag y y p 0 1 is a local bilipschitz map suppose are two local geodesics with d where 0 is such that by t 2 is busemann convex for all t 0 1 then t 7 dy t t is convex following the remark after lemma 1 23 in particular if and agree at 0 and 1 and d the convexity of the distance function implies this implies d max dy 0 0 dy 1 1 dy 2 p p while the estimate dy 2 p p 2 d holds always therefore p restricted to b is a 2 bilipschitz map b p b we may pull back the length metric from y y to obtain a unique length metric d y on y diag such that y diag dy y y dy 2 is a local isometry this metric is given by d y inf h p h where the infimum is taken over all the paths h in y diag joining and in particular we have the following lemma which is a kind of quantitative version of the local isometry of lemma 3 1 let y diag and 0 be such that by t 2 is convex for all t 0 1 then b y diag by 2 is a surjective isometry proof first note that by 2 by 0 by 1 is a busemann convex neighbourhood of by the general theory is a 1 lipschitz map dy 2 dy next let us show that if b y diag then t 7 dy t t is convex suppose d y and take a path h in b y diag joining and set u t 0 1 s 7 dy s ht s is convex this set is nonempty and closed let us show it is also open if t 0 u take so small that d ht ht 0 dy ht 0 whenever t t 0 since dy ht 0 is convex we have the estimate d ht 0 dy 2 ht 0 and so d ht d ht 0 d ht 0 ht dy 2 ht 0 dy ht 0 consequently s 7 dy s ht s is convex thus u is open whence u 0 1 and therefore dy h 1 dy is convex conversely given any pair x y by 2 lemma 1 22 yields a unique local geodesic y joining x and y such that t 7 dy t t is convex we conclude that p b y by 2 is a bijective 1 lipschitz map given b y diag take a path 0 1 in by 2 joining and and lift it to a path h in y y in the following way for each t let ht be the unique local geodesic joining 0 t and 1 t with s 7 dy s ht s convex 26 elefterios soultanis given by lemma 1 22 then h is a lift of joining and by the uniqueness and d y h taking infimum over we obtain d y dy 2 this finishes the proof since y 2 is locally convex nonpositively curved it follows that y diag is locally convex nonpositively curved and by 4 proposition i 3 28 is a covering map if y is locally compact it follows from the hopf rinow theorem that y diag is a complete proper geodesic space in the event that y q see the discussion after theorem 1 21 we have d y dq indeed the identity map y q dq y q dy is a local isometry for every y q the restriction bq is a surjective isometry whenever 0 is such that by t is a convex neighbourhood for all t 0 1 a fact we shall use is that for y q the distance in the dq metric is given by dq 1 where 1 denotes the unique local geodesic homotopic to 1 define s 7 hs 0 1 y q by hs t 1 2 s t 0 s 1 2 2 s 1 t 1 2 s 1 the path h is the lift of 1 starting at and ending at since y q is simply connected h is homotopic to the unique geodesic between and consequently 1 is homotopic to the local geodesic pq by proposition 1 24 uniqueness of local geodesic in the homotopy class of 1 we have pq 1 and thus dq pq 1 3 2 lifts definition 3 2 let h u v be a locally geodesic p quasihomotopy between two maps u v d 1 p x y the lift h of h is the map h x y given by mapping x x to the local geodesic path t 7 ht x y the covering map p y y 2 also induces a map p d 1 p x y d 1 p x y 2 pf x f 0 x f 1 x the fact that each component f 0 f 1 d 1 p x y follows from the fact that p is a lipschitz map note that if h u v is a locally geodesic p quasihomotopy and h its lift the identity p h u v holds proposition 3 3 let h u v be as in definition 3 2 then h d 1 p x y with 1 2 gu gv gh gu gv homotopy classes of newtonian spaces 27 proof as in the proof of theorem 2 7 let us take a sequence em em 1 of open sets in x with capp em 2 m and h x em 0 1 continuous homotopy between u x em and v x em and a path family with modp 0 so that whenever 1 there exists m 0 so that 1 em 0 and consequently 1 em for every m m 0 2 the inequalities dy u b u a a b gu dy v b v a a b gv hold for a b 0 1 let and let k x em 0 be a compact set containing the image of since h k 0 1 is uniformly continuous there is some 0 so that b z 2 y is a convex ball for all z h k 0 1 the image being a compact set by the uniform continuity of h k 0 1 there is 0 so that whenever a b 0 1 are such that a b we have dy ht b ht a for all t 0 1 it follows that d y h b h a dy 2 p h b p h a for a b 0 1 with a b on the other hand max dy u b u a dy v b v a dy 2 p h b p h b dy u b u a dy v b v a from this we see as in the proof of theorem 2 7 that g h gu gv to arrive at the other inequality note that by the leftmost inequality above any p weak upper gradient for h is also a p weak upper gradient for both u and v thus gu gh and gv gh almost everywhere from which we have 1 2 gu gv gh using the map p introduced after definition 3 2 we also have a converse result proposition 3 4 suppose f d 1 p x y and p f u v then h x t ft x defines a locally geodesic p quasihomotopy h u v proof by definition for p quasievery x x the path t 7 ht x ft x is a local geodesic suppose 0 is given and let e x be an open set with capp e so that f x e is continuous we claim that h x e 0 1 is a continuous homotopy between u x e and v x e from the fact that p f x u x v x it is clear that h x e 0 1 connects u x e and v x e to see continuity let x t x e 0 1 and 0 be arbitrary choose 0 so that p b f x 0 b p f x 0 is an isometry and moreover by ft x 2 0 is a convex ball in y for every t 0 1 by the continuity of f x e we find r 0 so that dy f x f y 0 whenever y b x r e these choices ensure that the distance function t 7 dy ft x ft y 28 elefterios soultanis is convex see remark after lemma 1 23 in particular d f x f y dy 2 p f x p f y let us use this to estimate dy h x t h y s dy h x t h x s dy h x s h y s t s f x d f x f y t s f x dy 2 p f x p f y t s f x d y f x f y t s f x therefore whenever y s b x r e b t f x we have dy h x t h y s 2 since 0 was arbitrary we have the desired continuity remark 3 5 propositions 3 3 and 3 4 prove theorem 1 1 they demonstrate a one to one correspondence between locally geodesic p quasihomotopies between maps that are in d 1 p x y and elements in d 1 p x y any locally geodesic p quasihomotopy h lifts to a map h d 1 p x y and conversely any map f d 1 p x y yields a locally geodesic p quasihomotopy 4 the manifold case in this section we take a look at the situation when the spaces x y are compact riemannian manifolds we shall adopt the notation m for the domain manifold and n for the target we begin by recalling some definitions relevant to the manifold setting 4 1 p 1 homotopy let m be an m dimensional riemannian manifold p an a dimensional parameter space also a riemannian manifold and d q a domain with compact closure and lipschitz boundary in a riemannian manifold q of dimension d assume moreover that the dimensions satisfy d a m given a lipschitz map h d p m we denote by h d m the map h x h x we further assume that h satisfies h 1 lip h c 0 for all p h 2 there exists a positive number c 1 so that the m dimensional jacobian jh satisfies jh x c 1 for hd a almost every x d p h 3 there is a positive number c 2 so that hd a m h 1 y c 2 forhm almost every y m the following very useful lemma can be found in 19 lemma 3 3 lemma 4 1 suppose h d p m satisfies h 1 h 3 then for any non negative borel function g m 0 we have p d g h x dhd x dha c 11 c 2 m g dhm let us assume that 1 p m and consider a map u n 1 p m n if k is a rectilinear cell complex and h k p m is a map such that h p satisfies h 1 h 3 for every cell k we have the following 19 lemma 4 3 homotopy classes of newtonian spaces 29 lemma 4 2 there exists a borel set e p with ha e 0 such that for all p e we have u h w 1 p k n if k n 0 k p then the map k h u p kk n defined by u h kk is measurable in the sense that 1 for any kk n here k k dim dimk and kk k dim k see also 19 section 3 and section 4 lemma 4 3 19 lemma 4 7 if p is further connected and 0 k p 1 then const ha almost everywhere on p let 0 0 be small and v 0 m x ra

constant by u p h definition 4 4 19 definition 4 1 two maps u v w 1 p m n are p 1 homotopic if u p h v p h for any rectilinear cell decomposition h k m after introducing the setting used in 19 we proceed with proving theorem 1 4 the following lemma establishes the measurability of a technical tool that will later be used in the proof lemma 4 5 suppose h d p m satisfies h 1 h 3 and let e m be open then the map 7 capp h 1 e is lower semicontinuous proof let k as k and x h 1 e i e h x e since e is open and h continuous there are open neighbourhoods u v x so that h u v e in particular there exists j so that x h 1 k e for all k j in other words we have h 1 e j 1 k j h 1 k e but from this we may estimate using the properties of the p capacity capp h 1 e capp j 1 k j h 1 k e lim j capp k j h 1 k e lim inf j capp h 1 j e 30 elefterios soultanis 4 2 p quasihomotopic maps are path homotopic but not vice versa the following simple counterexample demonstrates that path homotopy need not imply p quasihomotopy take m b 2 the closed unit ball of the plane and n s 1 consider the path and p quasihomotopy classes of the constant map 1 if h 1 u is a p quasihomotopy u n 1 p b 2 s 1 we may take the locally geodesic p quasihomotopy and lift it to obtain a map h n 1 p x s 1 diag which has the property that 0 h 1 quasieverywhere thus h x n 1 for p quasievery x x and we may view h as a map h x n 1 r it follows that if u n 1 p b 2 s 1 is p quasihomotopic to the constant map 1 then it admits a lift h n 1 p b 2 r conversely any lift h n 1 p b 2 r of yields a p quasihomotopy h 1 u through h x t exp 2 it h x note that r 7 exp 2 ir is the covering map r s 1 consequently the p quasihomotopy class of the constant map consists precisely of those maps u n 1 p b 2 s 1 which admit a lift h n 1 p b 2 r however we know that not all maps have this property for example one can consider the map u z z z when 1 p 2 in contrast if 1 p 2 then by 3 theorem 0 2 the space n 1 p b 2 s 1 is path connected thus the path homotopy and p homotopy classes do not always agree in contrast to the general case where some curvature assumption on the target space is needed to pass from p quasihomotopy to path homotopy cf theorem 2 10 the manifold setting does not require such an assumption this is the content of theorem 1 4 the proof of theorem 1 4 will proceed by showing that u and v are p 1 homotopic it is based on the following lemma lemma 4 6 there is a constant c depending on the data of h 1 h 3 and on p so that if e m is open then 4 1 p capp h 1 e dh a ccapp e proof suppose u n 1 p m is non negative with u e 1 then for ha almost every p u h n 1 p d is non negative and u h h 1 e 1 whence capp h 1 e u h p n 1 p d note that u h dh u h c 0 u h almost everywhere integrating over p and using this estimate we have p capp h 1 e dh a cp 0 p d u h x p u h x pdhd x dha cp 0 c 1 1 c 2 m u p u p dhm taking infimum over admissible u gives the claim with c c p 0 c 1 1 c 2 homotopy classes of newtonian spaces 31 proof of theorem 1 4 let f u v be a p quasihomotopy and let ej be the open sets such that capp ej 1 j and h m ej 0 1 is a classical homotopy u m ej v m ej fix a rectilinear cell decomposition h k m and set h x h x then for any k p 1 the restriction of h to ba 0 satisfies h 1 h 3 and by lemma 4 1 ba 0 capp h 1 ej dha ccapp ej denote z ba 0 h 1 ej 6 for all j we have ba 0 lim inf j capp h 1 ej dha lim inf j ba 0 capp h 1 ej dha c lim inf j capp ej 0 but because capp a c 0 for any nonempty a since dim d p it follows that if z then lim infj capp h 1 ej 0 this however can happen only on a set of ha measure zero and so ha z 0 by this and 19 lemma 3 5 we have that for almost every i u h w 1 p k n and ii h kd 1 ej for some j where d p 1 for these the restriction f h kd 0 1 is a homotopy between u h kd and v h kd therefore u p h v p h and we are done we already saw in this subsection that path homotopic maps need not be p quasihomotopic however if two maps can be connected by a rectifiable curve then they are p quasihomotopic theorem 1 3 let us close section 4 with a proof of proposition 1 9 the proof is essentially contained in 7 lemma 1 we sketch it here for completeness proof of proposition 1 5 the first part of the claim is standard and can be found in 17 introduction and the references therein since m is compact the standard and ohta topologies are given by a metric it suffices to prove that a sequence converging in the ohta metric also converges in the standard metric consider the nash embedding of n into some rl and recall that w 1 p m n u w 1 p m rl u x n a e x m take a sequence uj w 1 p m n converging to u w 1 p m n in the ohta metric then uj u in lp m n and the sequence uj is bounded in lp m rl hence uj u in lp m rl on the other hand convergence in the ohta metric implies m uj pdvol m u pdvol as j the uniform convexity of lp m rl yields that uj u lp m rl 0 as j thus uj u in the standard metric 32 elefterios soultanis the caveat here is that even though the ohta metric gives the same topology it is not in general a complete metric see 7 lemma 2 the author thanks the anonymous referee for pointing this out 5 p quasihomotopy classes of maps in this section we always assume that x is a complete space with a doubling measure supporting a weak 1 p poincare inequality and that y is a complete locally convex metric space given a map v d 1 p x y we want to study the p quasihomotopy class of v denoted v p ultimately we are interested in its com pactness properties since these are the key to proving existence of energy minimizing maps in a given p quasihomotopy class a first observation is that v p f 1 f d 1 p x y diag f 0 v this is easy to see using the one to one correspondence of p quasihomotopies and maps in d 1 p x y diag presented above let us set hv f d 1 p x y diag f 0 v abusing notation slightly we denote by hv v p the map f 7 1 f f 1 induced by the covering map 0 1 y diag y 2 since for f hv the first projection f 0 phi 0 f v always holds we may disregard it let us introduce some notation given a p quasihomotopy h u v we denote by h u v the locally geodesic p quasihomotopy associated to h given by theorem 2 3 it is evident that given two p quasihomotopies h u v and h v w the conjunction h h u w is a p quasihomotopy and we may consider the locally geodesic representative h h we call this the product of h and h the inverse h 1 of a p quasihomotopy h u v is simply the p quasihomotopy h 1 v u given by h 1 x t h x 1 t let gv denote the set of locally geodesic p quasihomotopiesh v v the product and inverse defined above turn gv into a group furthermore the group acts on hv from the right given elements gv and f hv we set f f indeed the map f 7 f hv gv hv defines a right group action on hv this is easily seen f 1 x f x for all f hv and f 2 1 x f 2 1 x f x x 2 x f x x 2 x 1 f 2 1 x f 2 1 x for p quasievery x x pointwise this is the action of 1 y v x on the universal covering space y v x for p quasievery x x remark 5 1 the group gv acts on h v by deck transformations i e f f for f hv gv this is directly seen from the definitions homotopy classes of newtonian spaces 33 next we demonstrate that the action of gv on h v is in fact both free and proper in the sense of 4 chapter i 8 definition 8 2 the following definition and lemma will prove useful definition 5 2 we say that a set u x is p quasiopen p quasiclosed or qua siopen quasiclosed for short if for every 0 there exists an open set e x with capp e so that u e is open closed in x e lemma 5 3 suppose x is compact f n 1 p x and the set f 0 both quasiclosed and quasiopen then either capp f 0 0 or capp x f 0 0 proof set a f 0 let fn fn 1 be a decreasing sequence of open sets in x such that capp fn 2 n f x fn is continuous and a fn is both closed and open in x fn we further denote by f the intersection of all fn s suppose capp a 0 then also capp a f 0 first we will show that x a 0 if x a 0 then also x f a 0 since for given n n the set a fn is both closed and open in x fn the same is true of x a fn x a fn therefore the sets a fn and x a fn form a separation of x fn for all n take x a f and y x a f with capp b x r f 0 and b y r a f 0 for all r 0 the condition is automatic for x since by 1 theorem 6 7 xii capp b x r capp b x r f and it is true for y provided we choose y to be a density point of x a f take 0 r d x y 2 whence b x r b y r furthermore the sets bn a b x r fn b n b y r a fn are disjoint and compact now 21 theorem 7 33 implies for compact x modp n capp bn b n inf x gpud u n 1 p x u bn 0 u b n 1 where n bn b n 2 choose a ball b 0 x so that bn b n b x r b y r b 0 and estimate for any u as in the above infimum by 1 theorem 5 53 b n 2 b 0 2 b 0 u pd c capp b 0 u 0 2 b 0 gpud c 2 b 0 capp bn x gpud from which we get taking infimum over u modp n 1 c b n capp bn since a b x r f n bn b y r a f n b n we have lim n b n capp bn b y r a f capp a b x r f and thus modp 0 lim sup n modp n 0 where 0 b y r a f a b x r f 2 here u v denotes the path family connecting the sets u and v 34 elefterios soultanis let 1 fn 6 n whence by lemma 2 6 modp 0 from the fact that modp 0 modp 0 modp 0 we conclude that there exists a curve 0 in other words there exists an index n 0 and a curve 0 with x fn 0 such a curve joins the sets a fn 0 and x a fn 0 in x fn 0 this however should be impossible since these two sets separate x fn 0 we conclude that x a 0 that is f 0 almost everywhere since f is p quasicontinuous it follows 1 proposition 1 59 that f 0 p quasieverywhere i e capp x a 0 the proof is now complete this lemma will be used to prove that the projection hv v p is a discrete map namely we have proposition 5 4 suppose x and y are compact and let u v p then the set 1 u f hv f 1 u is discrete with respect to the metric d f h x d p y f h d 1 p proof suppose h f 1 u are distinct and let hf 1 be the locally geodesic p quasihomotopy u u in the q e pointwise homotopy class of hf 1 u u consider the map l n 1 p x given by l x x let y be half the injectivity radius of y i e the largest number r with the property that every ball b y 2 r y y is a busemann space this is positive since y is compact it follows that if l x y then the loop x is contractible by busemann convexity therefore we have x x l x y x x l x 0 u since l is p quasicontinuous it follows that u is both p quasiclosed and p quasiopen whence by lemma 5 3 either capp u 0 or capp x u 0 note further that u x x d y f x h x y this is because for any q y the inclusion map q y q dq y dy is a local isometry with every restriction b y y q an isometry see the discussion after the construction of y section 3 this in turn implies d y f x h x dv x f x h x l x whenever l x y or equivalently dy f x h x y yielding the desired identity now suppose that d f h y x 1 p then we have x x dy f x h x y y p x homotopy classes of newtonian spaces 35 implying u x x x dy f x h x y 0 by lemma 5 3 we therefore have capp x u 0 in other words l 0 p quasieverywhere which implies d f h 0 this however is not possible since f and h are distinct and therefore we con clude that any two distinct f h 1 u must satisfy d f h y x 1 p we now introduce two minor alterations to the discussion above the first one is a change of metric for us it is convenient to use the metric d f h p x d p v x f x h x d x on hv instead of d this way we ensure that gv acts on h v by isometries indeed for p quasievery x x we have dv x f x x h x x dv x h x f x f h hv gv since pointwise this is simply the action of x y v x on y v x by isometry it follows that d f h d f h from the elementary inequality d y dq y q it follows that d d in particular the claim of proposition 5 4 remains true if the metric d is replaced by d the second alteration is on the space hv we introduce a parameter m 0 and denote by hvm the set hvm f hv g f lp m in other words we restrict our attention to maps f hv for which the end point u f satisfies a gradient lp norm upper bound by theorem 2 7 if u n 1 p x y m gv lp gu lp and h v u is a locally geodesic p quasihomotopy then ght lp m for every t clearly the claim of proposition 5 4 remains true if in addition to the change of metric the space hv is replaced by hvm we use the notation v p m for the image set h v m v p a little care is needed when considering hvm as a metric space with either of the metrics d or d since these only measure differences of maps up to sets of measure zero a crucial observation is that if u v x y admit p integrable upper gradients and u v almost everywhere then in fact u v p quasieverywhere and they may regarded as the same element in d 1 p x y this may be seen by applying 1 proposition 1 59 to d u v and 0 lemma 5 5 the set hvm equipped with the metric d is a proper metric space 36 elefterios soultanis proof take a sequence fn b h l f hvm d h f l each fn is the lift of the locally geodesic p quasihomotopy t 7 fn t v fn so using proposition 3 3 we may estimate d h fn gfn lp l gv lp g fn lp gv lp l m for all n and therefore the rellich kondrakov theorem 1 15 implies that a sub sequence denoted fn converges to some f n 1 p x y diag in the metric d by passing to a further subsequence we may assume that fn f pointwise almost everywhere in particular dv x fn x f x 0 as n for almost every x x from the fact that dq 1 for paths y q see discussion before definition 3 2 we observe that lfn x dv x fn x v where v denotes the lift of the trivial p quasihomotopy v v using this and lemma 2 8 we may estimate lfn lp glfn lp d fn v glfn lp d v h d h fn gp fn lp gv lp d v h l m gv lp for all n so for a still further subsequence the function lfn converges to some f n 1 p x in lp norm and pointwise almost everywhere we shall use the following general lebesgue dominated convergence theorem lemma 5 6 let fn be a sequence of measurable functions on a measure space that converges almost everywhere to f suppose there is a sequence gn of integrable functions that converge pointwise almost everywhere to a integrable function g such that fn gn for each n and lim n gnd gd then lim n fnd fd by the inequality dpv fn f 2 p 1 dpv fn v 2 p 1 dpv v f 2 p 1 l p fn 2 p 1 l p f we may take gn 2 p 1 l p fn 2 p 1 l p f and g 2 pl p f and use the above theorem to conclude lim n x dpv fn f d x lim n dpv fn f d 0 having established d fn f 0 as n it is evident that f b h l and therefore we have shown the compactness of b h l the next lemma expresses some nice properties of the action of the group gv on hvm m gv p proposition 5 7 the action of gv on h v m is proper and free moreover if f hvm and u f v p m then f gv 1 m u here m hvm homotopy classes of newtonian spaces 37 proof let us first show that the action is free if f h then for p quasievery x x one has f x x h x x since the action of 1 y v x on y v x is free this implies that x is the neutral element of 1 y v x i e the constant path v x since x is the path t 7 v x for p quasievery x x we have that is the trivial p quasihomotopy v v i e t v for all t 0 1 now suppose h b f b f then d f f 2 by remark 5 1 f f and thus proposition 5 4 and its proof implies that if 2 y x 1 p 0 then f f i e is the trivial p quasihomotopy v v the neutral element of the group gv this shows that for 0 2 the collection of gv for which b f b f 6 consists only of the neutral element finally let f hvm and u f v p m obviously f gv 1 m u since for all gv it holds that f p f but if h 1 m u let f 1 h gv and calculate f ff 1 h h so that h f gv 6 a weak compactness result and further discussion unfortunately i have been unable to prove that the restricted p quasihomotopy class v p m is compact with respect to the l p metric d to look for weaker results we shall utilize the metric properties of the spaces hvm d and h v m d in this section we assume that x and y are both compact in particular y diag is then proper an immediate corollary of lemma 5 7 is the following weak compactness result corollary 6 1 suppose v n 1 p x y and un is a sequence in v p with sup n gun lp converging to u in lp x y if the maps un can be connected to v by p quasihomotopies hn v un satisfying 6 1 sup n x lhnd then u v p proof let m 0 sup n gun lp and m 1 sup n x lhnd using the poincare in equality we estimate d v h n x l p hn d 1 p x lhnd c diam x x g p lhn d 1 p x 1 m 1 c diam x m 0 gv lp we use the notation v for the lift of the trivial p quasihomotopy v v again therefore hn hvm 0 b v l where l x 1 p 1 m 1 c diam x m 0 by the previous lemma a subsequence hn converges to some h hvm in the metric d furthermore we have x d p y h u d limn x d p y h p hn d limn d h hn 0 so that u h therefore u v p 38 elefterios soultanis this is an unsatisfactory result because of the extra assumption 6 1 of having to control the lengths of the homotopies hn the result is basically a restatement of the fact that given m 0 the space hvm equipped with metric d is a proper which in turn followed easily from the rellich kondrakov compactness theorem 1 15 removing the extra assumption 6 1 on the homotopies hn in corollary 6 1 amounts to ensuring that the space hvm gv arising from the action of gv on h v m in the previous subsection equipped with the metric d f gv h gv distd f gv h gv has finite diameter notice that the action of gv on h v m gives rise to a covering map hvm hvm gv and the metric d makes into a local isometry see 4 chapter i 8 proposition 8 5 3 to see the claim about the finite diameter take two elements f gv h gv hvm gv and let u f w h note that d f gv h gv inf gv d f h inf gv x l p h f 1 d 1 p the rightmost infimum is equal to the infimum over all locally geodesic p quasihomotopies h u w of the quantity x l p hd 1 p since for each gv h f 1 u w is a locally geodesic p quasihomotopy conversely given any locally geodesic p quasihomotopy h u w we may write it as h h h 1 h f f 1 where h 1 h f gv we obtain 6 2 d 1 u 1 w inf h u w x l p hd 1 p with this in hand it is easy to see that if hvm gv has finite diameter then 6 1 is automatically satisfied on the other hand requiring that for every sequence un v m condition 6 1 rewritten sup n inf h v un x l p hd is satisfied is equivalent to requiring that there is some c so that sup u v m inf h v u x l p hd c if such a constant did not exist we would have a sequence un contradicting the condition thus we see that 6 1 is automatically satisfied if and only if hvm gv has finite diameter observe that since hvm d is proper the same is true of h v m gv and therefore it has finite diameter if and only if it is compact what then can we say about the quotient space hvm gv homotopy classes of newtonian spaces 39 we may define a map m h v m gv v p m by m f gv f this is well defined by remark 5 1 by the last assertion in proposition 5 7 we see that m is bijective with the continuous bijection m h v m gv v p m at hand it is immedi ate that compactness of v p m is implied by the compactness of h v m gv indeed assuming this the map m is a homeomorphism by elementary topological con siderations in this event furthermore we see that m m hvm v p m is a covering map conversely assuming that m is a covering map we have that m is also a covering map and therefore a homeomorphism another way of interpreting the identity 6 2 is to identify hvm gv with v p m through the map m and d with a metric induced by a certain length structure on v p m see 14 definition 1 3 p 3 indeed the length structure is given by the family of paths h that are locally geodesic p quasihomotopies between the endpoint maps and the length functional is simply h x l p hd 1 p this point of view emphasizes the geo metric structure of v p m or n 1 p x y and in particular the question of compactness of v p m is reduced to asking does the length structure d give rise to the same topology on v p m as does the original lp metric d u w x d p y u w d 1 p this question remains open along with the question of existence of energy mini mizing maps in p quasihomotopy
