distance be tween two borel probability measures on a metric space this metric has a broad range of applications from bioinformatics to image processing and is commonly linked to the optimal transport problem in computer science 9 15 noteworthy to this paper will be the role of the kantorovich metric in the study of iterated function systems which are families of contractive mappings on a complete metric space when the underlying metric space is compact it is well known that the space of borel probability measures on this metric space equipped with the kantorovich metric constitutes a compact and thus complete metric space in previous work we generalized the kantorovich metric to operator valued measures for a compact underlying metric space and applied this generalized metric to the setting of iterated function systems 5 7 8 we note that the work of p jorgensen k shuman and k kornelson provided the framework for our application to this setting 11 12 13 the situation when the underlying metric space is complete but not necessarily compact has been studied by a kravchenko in 14 in this paper we extend the results of kravchenko to the generalized kantorovich metric on

2 2 an operator valued kantorovich metric on complete metric spaces publication note the final publication is available at springer via https doi org 10 1007 s 10440 018 0213 y 1 introduction this is the third in a series of related papers see 5 and 8 which discuss a general ized kantorovich metric for operator valued measures and its application to the study of iterated function systems let y d be a complete and separable metric space and let and be two borel probability measures on y we define the kantorovich metric h between the two measures by h sup f lip 1 y y fd y fd 1 1 where lip 1 y f y r f x f y d x y for all x y y an appealing feature of the kantorovich metric is that it is a natural generalization of the underlying metric on y indeed the map y y 7 y is an injective metric space isometry where y is the delta measure measure at y furthermore if y is compact and if q y is the collection of borel probability measures on y we have the following important facts 1 q y h is compact 2 the topology induced by the metric h on q y coincides with the weak topol ogy on q y in the case that y d is not compact and thus possibly unbounded the kantorovich metric may not be finite on q y to remedy this issue we restrict the h metric to m y which is defined to be the sub collection of borel probability measures on y such that f d for all f lip y where lip y is the collection of real valued lipschitz functions on y we say that a sequence of measures n n 1 m y converges weakly to a mea sure m y if lim n y fd n y fd for all f cb y where cb y denotes the collection of real valued bounded and continuous functions on y the following result due to a kravchenko will be impor tant to this paper theorem 1 1 14 kravchenko 1 the metric space m y h is complete 2 the topology induced by the h metric coincides with the weak topology on m y if and only if the metric space y is bounded the main tool in proving the first part of the above theorem is the following proposition note that lipb y refers to the collection of real valued bounded lipschitz functions on y an operator valued kantorovich metric on complete metric spaces 3 proposition 1 2 14 kravchenko let n n 1 be a sequence of borel measures on the complete and separable metric space y such that n y k for all n 1 2 and such that for all f lipb y the sequence of real numbers y fd n n 1 is cauchy then there exists a borel measure on y such that y k and such that the sequence n n 1 converges weakly to in previous work we generalized the kantorovich metric to operator valued mea sures when the underlying metric space y d is compact 5 7 8 indeed let h be a hilbert space and define b h to be the bounded operators on h put b y to be the collection of borel measurable subsets of y definition 1 3 a positive operator l b h satisfies lh h 0 for all h h definition 1 4 a positive operator valued measure with respect to the pair y h is a map a b y b h such that a is a positive operator in b h for all b y a 0 and a y idh the identity operator on h if n n 1 is a sequence of pairwise disjoint sets in b y and if g h h then a n 1 n g h n 1 a n g h definition 1 5 a projection e b h satisfies e 2 e idempotent and e e self adjoint definition 1 6 a projection valued measure with respect to the pair y h is a map e b y b h such that e is a projection in b h for all b y e 0 and e y idh the identity operator on h e 1 2 e 1 e 2 for all 1 2 b y if n n 1 is a sequence of pairwise disjoint sets in b y and if g h h then e n 1 n g h n 1 e n g h let s y be the collection of positive operator valued measures with respect to the pair y h and let p y be the collection of projection valued measures with re spect to the pair y h since projections are positive operators we have the inclusion p y s y define a metric on s y by a b sup f lip 1 y y fda y fdb 1 2 where denotes the operator norm in b h and a and b are arbitrary members of s y this is called the generalized kantorovich metric and we first defined this metric in 5 and 7 4 an operator valued kantorovich metric on complete metric spaces theorem 1 7 5 7 davison if y d is compact the metric space s y is complete and p y is a closed subset of s y with respect to the metric as such p y is complete we now provide some context for this generalized kantorovich metric by relating it to the operator norm in b h and also by discussing a noteworthy application of this metric to quantum theory let m 0 be some fixed constant and let bm be the collection of all normal operators on h such that n m where denotes the operator norm of n we note that if n bm then the spectrum of n denoted n is contained in b 0 m the closed ball of radius m in c centered at the origin by the spectral theorem for normal operators there exists a one to one correspondence between bm and the collection of projection valued measures with respect to the pair b 0 m h that is the map n bm 7 e p b 0 m is bijective where e satisfies n n zde z since b 0 m is compact we conclude by theorem 1 7 that p b 0 m is a complete metric space moreover the metric induces a metric on bm in the following way if n a bm define n a e f where n n zde z and a a zdf z the bijective correspondence n bm 7 e p b 0 m guarantees that is a metric and that the metric space bm is complete by definition a sequence nk k 1 bm converges to n bm in the metric if and only if the corresponding sequence ek k 1 b 0 m converges to e b 0 m in the metric the relation ship between the metric and operator norm is described below proposition 1 8 5 7 davison the topology induced by the metric on bm coin cides with the topology induced by the operator norm on bm recall that if the metric space y is compact then q y h is compact however the metric space p y is not compact this hinges on the above proposition and is described in our previous work 5 we now highlight an interesting application of the generalized kantorovich metric to mathematical physics namely this metric has been previously defined by r f werner in the setting of quantum theory 16 a positive operator valued measure is also called an observable in physics werner introduces the generalized kantorovich metric as a tool for studying the position and momentum observables which are central objects of study in quantum theory we initially defined the generalized kantorovich metric to be used in the study of iterated function systems 5 7 8 let l y y be a lipschitz contraction on the complete and separable metric space y d the map l admits a unique fixed point y y meaning that l y y this result is known as the contraction mapping principle or the banach fixed point theorem in 1981 j hutchinson published a seminal paper see 10 where he generalized the contraction mapping principle to a finite family s 0 n 1 of lipschitz contractions on y where n n is such an operator valued kantorovich metric on complete metric spaces 5 that n 2 indeed one can associate to s a unique compact subset x y which is invariant under the s meaning that x n 1 i 0 i x 1 3 the finite family of lipschitz contractions s 0 n 1 is called an iterated function system ifs on y and the compact invariant subset x described above is called the self similar fractal set or attractor set associated to the ifs the attractor set can be realized as the support of a borel probability measure which we call the hutchinson measure this is described in the following theorem theorem 1 9 10 14 hutchinson kravchenko the map t m y m y given by t n 1 i 0 1 n 1 i is a lipschitz contraction on the complete metric space m y h by the contraction mapping principle there exists a unique borel probability measure m y such that t the support of is the attractor set x let h l 2 x where x is the attractor set associated to s and is the corre sponding hutchinson measure following the work of p jorgensen we define operators on h as follows fi h h given by 7 1 n i for all i 0 n 1 theorem 1 10 12 jorgensen kornelson shuman the family of operators fi n 1 i 0 satisfy the operator identity n 1 i 0 f i fi idh consider the metric space s x consisting of positive operator valued mea sures with respect to the pair x h theorem 1 11 8 davison the map v s x s x given by b 7 n 1 i 0 f i b 1 i fi is a lipschitz contraction in the metric corollary 1 12 8 davison there exists a unique positive operator valued measure a s x such that a n 1 i 0 f i a 1 i fi 1 4 6 an operator valued kantorovich metric on complete metric spaces the proof of the above corollary hinges on theorem 1 11 and the fact that s x is a complete metric space which is theorem 1 7 notably the operator valued mea sure a generalizes the the hutchinson measure in the sense that if f 1 h the scalar measure af f a f f satisfies af f it is important to note that jorgensen was the first to associate an operator valued measure to an iterated function system and thus he laid the groundwork for our study of this topic indeed we have the following definition and result definition 1 13 an ifs has non essential overlap if i x j x when i 6 j theorem 1 14 11 13 jorgensen suppose that an ifs has non essential overlap and that each member of the ifs is an injection there exists a unique projection valued measure e with respect to the pair x h such that e n 1 i 0 f i e 1 i fi previously in 5 we presented an alternative proof to theorem 1 14 using the con traction mapping principle this approach was further generalized to the case of an arbitrary ifs which is described in theorem 1 11 and corollary 1 12 in this paper we will consider the generalized kantorovich metric when the underly ing metric space is complete and separable not necessarily compact namely we will generalize part 1 of theorem 1 1 to projection and positive operator valued measures an application of this result will be to restate theorem 1 11 in the following way no tice that the map t described in theorem 1 9 is a map on m y where y is the ambient metric space which contains the attractor set x as a subset the map v described in theorem 1 11 is a map on s x where x is the attractor set not the ambient space we will extend v to a map on s 0 y a sub collection of positive operator valued mea sures with respect to the pair y l 2 y thereby providing a direct generalization of theorem 1 9 to operator valued measures for this to be possible we note that the maps fi l 2 x l 2 x defined above can extend to maps fi l 2 y l 2 y given by the same formula and theorem 1 10 still holds true if we view these operators on l 2 y 2 results 2 1 a sub collection of operator valued measures let y d be a complete and separable metric space and let h be a hilbert space let p 0 y be the collection of projection valued measures with respect to the pair y h with the following additional property if e p 0 y then for all f lip y there exists an 0 mf e such that y fdeg h mf e g h an operator valued kantorovich metric on complete metric spaces 7 for all g h h and where lip y denotes the collection of all real valued lipschitz functions on y an example of an element in p 0 y would be a projection valued measure e such that e k 1 h for k a compact subset of y in this case note that e y k 0 if f lip y let mf e maxx k f x and observe that y fdeg h k fdeg h y k fdeg h k f d eg h mf e g h for all g h h which implies that e p 0 y we can define s 0 y to be the posi tive operator valued measures with respect to the pair y h with this same additional property we have the containment p 0 y s 0 y since projections are positive operators on this sub collection of positive operator valued measures we will consider the gen eralized kantorovich metric that is for a b s 0 y define exactly as before a b sup f lip 1 y y fda y fdb theorem 2 1 4 theorem ii 2 2 in conway let u h h c be a bounded sesquilinear form with bound m there exists a unique operator a b h such that u g h ag h for all g h h and such that a m we will now show that this metric is finite on s 0 y to do this we need to make a preliminary observation in particular if a s 0 y and f lip y there exists by definition 0 mf a such that y fdag h mf a g h for all g h h this means that the map g h 7 y fdag h is a bounded sesquilinear form by theorem 2 1 there exists a bounded operator fda b h such that y fda g h y fdag h for all g h h where y fda mf a let a b s 0 y f lip 1 y and x 0 y then y fda y fdb y fda f x 0 idh f x 0 idh y fdb y fda y f x 0 da y fdb y f x 0 db y f f x 0 da y f f x 0 db let h h with h 1 then 8 an operator valued kantorovich metric on complete metric spaces y f x f x 0 da h h y f x f x 0 dah h x y f x f x 0 dah h x y d x x 0 dah h x md x x 0 a h 2 md x x 0 a where md x x 0 a 0 is the non negative number associated to the lip y function d x x 0 and the positive operator valued measure a hence y f f x 0 da md x x 0 a similarly there exists an md x x 0 b 0 such that y f f x 0 db md x x 0 b since md x x 0 a and md x x 0 b do not depend on the choice of f lip 1 y a b md x x 0 a md x x 0 b 2 2 the metric space p 0 y is complete in this section we will show that the metric space p 0 y is complete we will rely on proposition 1 2 we will also use the following lemma which can be found in the proof of proposition 1 in 2 lemma 2 2 2 proposition 1 in berberian let bn n 1 be a sequence of positive operators on the hilbert space h such that bn m for all n 1 2 and such that for all h h limn bnh h 0 then limn bnh 0 proof let h h note that bnh 2 bnh bnh bnh g where g bnh by a generalized schwarz inequality 0 bnh g bnh h 1 2 bng g 1 2 bnh h 1 2 bng g 1 2 bnh h 1 2 bn 3 h 2 1 2 bnh h 1 2 m 3 2 h by assumtion limn bnh h 0 hence limn bnh h 1 2 m 3 2 h 0 which implies that limn bnh 0 theorem 2 3 7 davison the metric space p 0 y is complete proof we note that the proof of this result uses some of the same techniques as in the proof of the analogous result by kravchenko 14 that m y h is complete see theorem 1 1 suppose that en n 1 is a cauchy sequence of elements in p 0 y we want to find an e p 0 y such that en e in the metric claim 2 4 let h h and f lip y the sequence y fdenh h n 1 is a cauchy sequence of real numbers an operator valued kantorovich metric on complete metric spaces 9 proof of claim this claim follows from the observation that there exists a t 0 such that f t lip 1 y hence 0 y f t denh h y f t demh h y f t den y f t dem h h y f t den y f t dem h 2 en em h 2 0 as m n since h and t are fixed y fdenh h y fdemh h 0 as m n this proves the claim observe that enh h y en y h h h 2 for all n 1 2 since lipb y lip y we can use proposition 1 2 to conclude that there exists a borel measure h h on y such that h h y h 2 and such that enh h converges to h h in the weak topology that is for all f cb y we have that lim n y fdenh h y fd h h for g h h we want to define g h such that lim n y fdeng h y fd g h 2 1 for all f cb y to this end let g h h if eng h reeng h iimeng h we can calculate that reeng h 1 2 eng h g h eng g enh h and imeng h 1 2 enig h ig h eng g enh h accordingly define re g h 1 2 g h g h g g h h and im g h 12 ig h ig h g g h h hence by the discussion in the above paragraph we can conclude equation 2 1 using a similar method as in the proof of theorem 2 19 from our previous paper see 8 we can conclude that the map g h 7 g h is sesquilinear and that g h inherits the following two additional properties for g h h g h has total variation less than or equal to g h for g h h g h h g let b y the map g h 7 y 1 d g h is a bounded sesquilinear form with bound 1 by theorem 2 1 there exists a unique bounded operator e b h such that for all g h h e g h y 1 d g h with e 1 define e b y b h by 7 e and note that for g h h eg h g h this map e is a positive operator valued measure the proof this fact can be found in theorem 2 19 in our previous paper 8 it remains to show that e p 0 y that is we need to show 10 an operator valued kantorovich metric on complete metric spaces 1 for f lip y there exists an mf e such that y fdeg h mf e g h for all g h h 2 en n 1 converges to e in the metric 3 e is a projection valued measure we will first show 1 choose some f 0 lip y there exists a t 0 such that 1 t f lip 1 y since we are assuming the sequence en n 1 is cauchy in the metric the sequence of self adjoint operators fden n 1 is cauchy in the operator norm topology on b h this implies that these operators are uniformly bounded that is there exists an n 0 such that y fden n for all n 1 for all g h h we claim that y fdeg h indeed choose h h and con sider the sequence enh h n 1 which converges to eh h in the weak topology for k 1 2 3 define fk x min k f x cb y lip y and note that fk f on y we note here that the idea of using the cutoff function fk is also a central part of the proof of theorem 1 1 by a kravchenko by the monotone convergence theorem y fkdeh h y fdeh h suppose this is an unbounded increasing sequence then choose a kl such that y fkldeh h l where l 1 2 for a fixed l y fkldenh h y fkldeh h because enh h n 1 converges to eh h in the weak topology and fkl cb y hence choose an nl such that y fkldenlh h l again by the monotone convergence theorem y fkldenlh h y fdenlh h and hence y fdenlh h l this last line is a contradiction to the fact that the sequence y fdenh h n 1 is a cauchy sequence of real numbers because f lip y and claim 2 4 hence y fdeh h for all h h for g h h we can decompose eg h into its pos itive measure parts as we have done previously to get that y fdeg h an operator valued kantorovich metric on complete metric spaces 11 the next thing to note is that since fk x f x y fkden y fden for all n as elements of b h hence for any k and n y fkden y fden n we are now prepared to show that there exists an mf e such that y fdeg h mf e g h for all g h h let 0 and let g h h since fk f and y fdeg h there exists a k such that y f fk deg h observe that y fdeg h y f fk deg h y fkdeg h lim n y fkdeng h where the second inequality is because fk cb y we know that for all n and k that y fkdeng h fkden g h n g h therefore lim n y fkdeng h n g h since is arbitrary y fdeg h n g h note that n does not depend on the choice of g h h it only depends on the choice of f 0 lip y hence we can let mf e n for any arbitrary f lip y decompose f into its positive and negative parts f f f note that f and f are both non negative elements of lip y let mf e mf e mf e for g h h y fdeg h y f deg h y f deg h mf e g h mf e g h mf e g h this completes the proof of 1 we will next show 2 we need to show that en e in the metric let 0 since en n 1 is cauchy in the metric there exists an n such that for n m n en em 6 let n n let f lip 1 y with f 0 and 12 an operator valued kantorovich metric on complete metric spaces define fk x min k f x cb y lip 1 y as before observe that fk f on y let h h with h 1 by the monotone convergence theorem y fkdenh h y fdenh h and y fkdeh h y fdeh h where the finiteness of the limiting integrals is because en p 0 y and because e satisfies part 1 above accordingly choose k such that y fkdenh h y fdenh h 6 and y fkdeh h y fdeh h 6 since emh h m 1 converges in the weak topology to eh h and fk cb y lim m y fkdemh h y fkdeh h then y fden y fde h h y fdenh h y fdeh h y fdenh h y fkdenh h y fkdenh h y fkdeh h y fkdeh h y fdeh h y fdenh h y fkdenh h lim m y fkdenh h y fkdemh h y fkdeh h y fdeh h 6 lim m y fkdenh h y fkdemh h 6 3 lim m y fkden y fkdem h h 3 6 2 because of the inequality y fkden y fkdem h h y fkden y fkdem h 2 en em h 2 en em hence for n n and f lip 1 y such that f 0 y fden y fde 2 an operator valued kantorovich metric on complete metric spaces 13 now for arbitrary f lip 1 y decompose f into its positive and negative parts f f f note that f and f are both non negative elements of lip 1 y then for n n y fden y fde y f den y f de y f den y f de 2 2 which shows that en e this is because the choice of n is independent of the choice of f lip 1 y lastly we need to show 3 that is we need to show that e is a projection valued measure since we know that e is a positive operator valued measure e is self adjoint for all b y hence to show that e is a projection valued measure it is enough to show that e 1 2 e 1 e 2 for 1 2 b y to this end let c and d be closed subsets of y let fn n 1 be a sequence of functions in lip y such that fn 1 c and such that fn 1 for all n 1 2 for instance one could let fn x max 1 nd x c 0 similarly let gn n 1 be a sequence of functions in lip y such that gn 1 d and such that gn 1 for all n 1 2 for all h h by the dominated convergence theorem y fnde h h y 1 cde h h as n that is for all h h y fn 1 cdeh h 0 as n also note that for all n 1 2 y fn 1 cde fn 1 c 1 moreover since e is already known to be a positive operator valued measure and since fn 1 c 0 for all n 1 2 the sequence of operators y fn 1 cde n 1 are positive operators by the above discussion we see that the sequence of operators y fn 1 cde n 1 satisfies lemma 2 2 this means that for all h h lim n y fn 1 cde h 0 which is equivalent to saying that lim n y fnde h e c h 0 2 2 similarly lim n y gnde h e d h 0 2 3 we now have the following claim 14 an operator valued kantorovich metric on complete metric spaces claim 2 5 for all n 1 2 y fnde y gnde y fngnde proof of claim choose some n 1 2 since fn lip y with fn 1 and since gn lip y with gn 1 fngn lip y next since em e in the metric we have that y fndem y fnde y gndem y gnde and y fngndem y fngnde as m where convergence is in the operator norm moreover since em is a projection valued measure and since fn and gn are bounded we have that y fndem y gndem y fngndem for all m 1 2 combin ing all of this data we get that y fngndem y fndem y gndem y fnde y gnde and y fngndem y fngnde as m which shows that y fngnde y fnde y gnde this completes the proof of the claim we will now show that e c e d e c d as an operator on h note that fn 1 c gn 1 d and moreover fngn 1 c d hence for h h we also have that y fngnde h h y 1 c dde h h as n since e is a positive operator valued measure we know that e c is self adjoint therefore e c e d h h e d h e c h lim n y gnde h y fnde h lim n y fngnde h h y 1 c dde h h e c d h h where the second equality is by equations 2 2 and 2 3 and the third equality is because of claim 2 5 now let 1 2 b y if h h note that eh h is a tight measure hence there exists a sequence of compact subsets ck k 1 b y such that eh h ck eh h 1 and a sequence of compact subsets dk k 1 b y such that eh h dk eh h 2 additionally eh h ck dk eh h 1 2 note that e 1 e ck h h 0 as k next note that since ck 1 for all k 1 2 the operator e 1 e ck is a positive operator moreover e 1 e ck 2 for all k 1 2 we can appeal to lemma 2 2 to conclude that limk e 1 e ck h 0 or equivalently limk e 1 h e ck h 0 similarly limk e 2 h e dk h 0 then e 1 e 2 h h e 2 h e 1 h lim k e dk h e ck h an operator valued kantorovich metric on complete metric spaces 15 lim k e ck e dk h h lim k e ck dk h h e 1 2 h h where the fourth equality is because ck and dk are compact in particular closed hence e is a projection valued measure and this completes the proof of part 3 and the theorem corollary 2 6 7 davison the metric space s 0 y is complete and p 0 y is a closed subset of s 0 y proof the proof of the above theorem can be adapted to show s 0 y is com plete moreover the completeness of p 0 y implies that it is a closed subset of s 0 y 2 3 a modified generalized kantorovich metric as mentioned above one limita tion of the kantorovich metric and the generalized kantorovich metric is that they are not finite when the underlying metric space is unbounded we can restrict these metrics to a sub collection of measures where they are finite or we can introduce a modification on the these metrics as described below let q y denote the collection of borel probability measures on y in our previous paper we define a modified kantorovich metric mh on q y defined as follows for q y mh sup y fd y fd f lip 1 y and f 1 2 4 the condition f 1 guarantees that mh will be finite on q y using proposi tion 1 2 and section 8 3 in bogachev see 3 we were able to deduce that the metric space q y mh is complete it is worth mentioning that this modified kantorovich metric is not appropriate in applications to iterated function systems and thus one must use the original definition as defined in equation 1 1 we will now modify the generalized kantorovich metric indeed let p y denote the collection of projection valued measures with respect to the pair y h definition 2 7 7 davison define m on p y by m e f sup y fde y fdf f lip 1 y and f 1 for e f p y once again the condition f 1 guarantees that this metric will be finite on p y theorem 2 8 7 davison the metric space p y m is complete proof the proof of this theorem follows the proof of theorem 2 3 with several differ ences that we will point out suppose that en n 1 is a cauchy sequence of elements in p y m we want to find an e p y m such that en e in the m met ric because m takes a supremum over f lip 1 y such that f 1 we obtain a version of claim 2 4 only for lipb y functions however this is not an impediment because proposition 1 2 only considers lipb y functions hence using the techniques 16 an operator valued kantorovich metric on complete metric spaces of the proof of theorem 2 3 we obtain a positive operator valued measure e on y the proof that e is a projection valued measure depends on the construction of a sequence fn n 1 lip y but one can see that actually this sequence of functions is contained in lipb y hence the proof that e is a projection valued measure carries over to the m metric lastly we need to show that en e in the m metric let 0 choose an n such that for n m n m en em let f lip 1 y with f 1 and let h h with h 1 if n n y fden y fde h h y fdenh h y fdeh h lim m y fdenh h y fdemh h where the last equality is because f cb y and emh h converges weakly to eh h observe that for all m n y fdenh h y fdemh h y fden y fdem h h m en em h 2 therefore if n n y fden y fde since n does not depend on the choice of f m en e and p y m is complete corollary 2 9 7 davison let s y be the collection of positive operator valued measures with respect to y h the metric space s y m is complete and p y m is a closed subset of s y m proof the proof of the above theorem can be adapted to the case of positive operator valued measures moreover the completeness of p y m implies that it is a closed subset of s y m 2 4 wot weak topology for this sub section assume that y d is compact thus p 0 y p y and s 0 y s y in the introduction we mentioned that the metric space p y is not compact and therefore s y is also not compact in this section we will consider a topology on s y that is weaker than the topology induced by the metric which we call the wot weak topology we will show that the wot weak topology on s y is compact by directly generalizing the proof in the classical setting that q y h is compact importantly we note that this fact has been pre viously shown by s ali see 1 using another approach as such we also attribute corollary 2 14 to ali we remark that this section is a deviation from the main trajec tory of this paper which resumes next section but we believe the results in this section provide some worthwhile insight into another topology on s y definition 2 10 let h be a hilbert space the weak operator topology wot on b h is the locally convex topology defined by the semi norms ph k h k h where ph k ah k accordingly a net of operators li i i b h converges an operator valued kantorovich metric on complete metric spaces 17 to an operator l b h in the weak operator topology if lih k lh k for all h k h theorem 2 11 4 proposition ix 5 5 in conway if m 0 the subset of l b h l m b h is compact in the weak operator topology equip b h with the weak operator topology for each f c y define a mapping f s y b h by a 7 y fda we note here that we will use the following equivalent notations f a y fda a f let the wot weak topology be the weakest topology on s y that makes the col lection of maps f f cr y continuous where we put the weak operator topology on b h and where cr y denotes the collection of real valued continuous functions on y in other words a net of positive operator valued measures ai i i s y con verges to a positive operator valued measure a s y if for all f cr y f ai converges to f a in the weak operator topology since the weak operator topology is a weaker topology than the operator norm topology on b h the wot weak topology is a weaker topology than the topology induced by the metric on s y theorem 2 12 7 davison the wot weak topology is sequentially compact proof let an n 1 be a sequence in s y since y is compact c y is separable and therefore choose a countable dense subset of functions fi i 1 c y consider the bounded operators an f 1 n 1 note that for all n 1 an f 1 f 1 since the subset l b h l f 1 b h is compact in the weak op erator topology see theorem 2 11 the sequence an f 1 n 1 admits a convergent subsequence in the weak operator topology which we call a 1 n f 1 n 1 consider the sequence of bounded operators a 1 n f 2 n 1 since for all n 1 a 1 n f 2 f 2 the subsequence a 1 n f 2 n 1 admits a further subsequence a 2 n f 2 n 1 which is convergent in the weak operator topology if we continue the process we obtain for each i 1 a sequence ain fi n 1 which is convergent in the weak oper ator topology such that ai 1 n n 1 is a subsequence of ain n 1 now choose some fi c y for 1 i and consider the diagonal sequence ann fi n 1 for n i ann fi is a subsequence of ain fi and since ain fi n i is convergent in the weak operator topology so is ann fi n i which implies that ann fi n 1 is convergent in the weak operator topology let f c y and g h h we will show that the sequence ann f g h n 1 is cauchy in c if g 0 or h 0 then the result is clear because every term in the sequence is zero therefore suppose that g 6 0 and h 6 0 choose fi c y such that f fi 3 h g by above we know that ann fi n 1 is convergent in the weak operator topology therefore there exists an n such that for m n n ann fi g h amm fi g h 3 18 an operator valued kantorovich metric on complete metric spaces thus if m n n ann f g h amm f g h ann f g h ann fi g h ann fi g h amm fi g h amm fi g h amm f g h y f fi danng h 3 y f fi dammg h hence for all f c y and g h h the sequence ann f g h n 1 y fdanng h n 1 is cauchy in c define g h c y c by f 7 limn y fdanng h observe that g h is a bounded linear functional and hence g h is a measure using a similar approach as in the proof of theorem 2 19 from our previous paper see 8 we note that the map g h 7 g h is sesquilinear and accordingly there exists a positive operator valued measure a s y such that a g h g h for all b y it remains to show that ann n 1 converges to a in the weak operator topology choose f cr y and g h h by construction ann f g h a f g h hence an n 1 admits a convergent subsequence ann n 1 in the wot weak topology which completes the proof proposition 2 13 7 davison let h be a separable hilbert space the wot weak topology on s y is first countable proof since h is a separable hilbert space let o hj j 1 be a countable orthonormal basis in h since cr y is separable let p be a countable dense subset of cr y let a s y f 1 fk p and hj hl o for n n 1 2 consider the following subset of s y b s y b fi hj hl a fi hj hl 1 n for all i 1 k consider the collection of all finite intersections of subsets of s y of the above form where a s y f 1 fk p hj hl o n n are all arbitrary this forms a basis for a topology on s y which is first countable and let this topology be denoted we claim that the the topology and the wot weak topology coincide to this end put the weak operator topology on b h and let f cr y we will show that the previously defined map f s y b h is continuous with respect to the topology since the wot weak topology is the weakest topology making all of the maps of the form f f cr y continuous we will have shown that the wot weak topology is weaker than the topology an operator valued kantorovich metric on complete metric spaces 19 since the topology is first countable it can be defined by sequences therefore suppose an n 1 s y converges in the topology to a s y we need to show that f an f a in the weak operator topology note that for all n fdan f and hence sup n 1 fdan therefore by proposition ix 1 3 in 4 it is enough to show that limn an f hj hl a f hj hl for all hj hl o accordingly let hj hl o and let 0 choose g p such that f g 3 hj hl and choose s 0 such that 1 s 3 consider o b s y b g hj hl a g hj hl 1 s since an a in the topology there exists an n such that for n n an o for n n an f hj hl a f hj hl an f hj hl a g hj hl an g hj hl a g hj hl a g hj hl a f hj hl f g hj hl 1 s f g hj hl hence an f a f in the weak operator topology let a s y and let w b s y b fi hj hl a fi hj hl 1 n for all i 1 k be an arbitrary sub basis element of the the topology we need to show that w is open in the wot weak topology define oi f i 1 l b h lhj hl a fi hj hl 1 n since the set l b h lhj hl a fi hj hl 1 n is open in the weak operator topology oi is open in the wot weak topology notice that oi b s y b fi hj hl a fi hj hl 1 n now observe that w k i 1 oi which is an open element in the wot weak topology because each oi is open in the wot weak topology hence the two topologies coin cide since the topology is first countable the wot weak topology is first countable as well corollary 2 14 1 7 ali davison let h be a separable hilbert space the wot weak topology on s y is compact proof since h is a separable hilbert space the above proposition shows that the wot weak topology on s y is first countable by theorem 2 12 we know that s y is sequentially compact in first countable topologies sequential compactness and com pactness are equivalent hence s y with the wot weak topology is compact 20 an operator valued kantorovich metric on complete metric spaces 2 5 application to ifs as mentioned earlier we discuss an application to iterated function systems let y d be an arbitrary complete and separable metric space equipped with an ifs s 0 n 1 suppose that k l 2 y where is the hutchin son measure associated to the ifs whose support is the compact attractor set x y let s 0 y be the collection of positive operator valued measures with respect to the pair y k with the additional condition see section 2 1 that if b s 0 y then for all f lip y there exists an 0 mf b such that y fdbg h mf b f g for all g h k recall that fi k k is given by 7 1 n i and the fi operators satisfy n 1 i 0 f i fi idk as described in theorem 1 10 note that the operators fi are originally defined on l 2 x but they can be extended to a map on k theorem 2 15 davison the map v s 0 y s 0 y given by b 7 n 1 i 0 f i b 1 i fi is a lipschitz contraction in the metric as such there exists a unique positive operator valued measure a s 0 y satisfying a n 1 i 0 f i a 1 i fi proof we need to show that v maps into s 0 y to see why v is a lipschitz contrac tion we refer the reader to theorem 2 15 in our previous paper 5 the correct proof of this theorem occurs in the erratum to this previous paper 6 let f lip y and b s 0 y one can verify that v b satisfies the properties of a positive operator valued measure and it remains to check that there exists an 0 mf v b such that y fdv b g h mf v b g h for all g h h let g h h then an operator valued kantorovich metric on complete metric spaces 21 y fdv b g h n 1 i 0 y fdbfig fih 1 i n 1 i 0 y f idbfig fih n 1 i 0 y f idbfig fih since f lip y f i lip y for all i 0 n 1 hence n 1 i 0 y f idbfig fih n 1 i 0 mf i b fig fih n 1 i 0 mf i b g h n 1 i 0 mf i b g h mf b g h where we define mf b n 1 i 0 mf i b note that the second inequality above is because fih fih 2 1 2 n 1 i 0 fih 2 1 2 n 1 i 0 fih fih 1 2 n 1 i 0 f i fih h 1 2 n 1 i 0 f i fi h h 1 2 h h 12 h by corollary 2 6 the metric space s 0 y is complete and thus there exists a unique positive operator valued measure a s 0 y satisfying a n 1 i 0 f i a 1 i fi 22 an operator valued kantorovich metric on complete metric spaces we will now show that the support of a is x to this end we have the following definition definition 2 16 the support of a positive operator valued measure a with respect to the pair y k is the closed subset y u y a u 0 and u open where 0 is the zero operator on k we briefly repeat some preliminaries that also appeared in our previous paper 8 define n 0 n 1 and let 1 n it is well known that is a compact metric space the metric m on is given by m 1 2 j where and j n is the first entry at which and differ we next define the shift maps on this compact metric space indeed for 0 i n 1 let i be given by i 1 2 i 1 2 and define given by 1 2 3 2 3 the maps i are lipschitz contractions on in the m metric and therefore the family of maps t 0 n 1 constitutes an ifs on the compact metric space is itself the attractor set associated to the ifs t the hutchinson measure p on associated to the ifs t is called the bernoulli measure and it satisfies p 1 n n 1 i 0 p 1 i the map is a left inverse for each i meaning that i id for each 0 i n 1 for each 0 i n 1 we can define ri l 2 p l 2 p by 7 1 n i by theorem 1 14 there exists a unique projection valued measure e with respect to the pair l 2 p such that e n 1 i 0 r ie 1 i ri 2 5 for each define n 1 1 n x where 1 2 n since the maps i are all contractive is a single point in x define the map x y by as the coding map lemma 2 17 12 jorgensen kornelson shuman the coding map is continuous moreover for all 0 i n 1 we have the relation i i 2 6 an operator valued kantorovich metric on complete metric spaces 23 this lemma is used to proved the following theorem theorem 2 18 12 jorgensen kornelson shuman 1 the operator v l 2 y l 2 p given by v f f is isometric 2 the following intertwining relations hold v fi riv for all 0 i n 1 consider now the projection valued measure e 1 from the borel subsets of y into the projections on l 2 p the following result first appeared in our previous paper when we were considering positive operator valued measures defined only on the compact attractor set x 8 with theorem 2 15 we can extend this result to positive operator valued measures on y which becomes useful for calculating the support of a theorem 2 19 8 davison the projection valued measure e 1 and the pos itive operator valued measure a from theorem 2 15 are related as follows v e 1 v a theorem 2 20 davison the support of the positive operator valued measure a from theorem 2 15 is x proof consider the open subset u xc y note that a u v e 1 u v v e v 0 hence the support of a is contained in x to show that x is contained in the support of a we employ a proof by contradiction indeed suppose the point x x is not in the support of a then x w where w is an open subset of y such that a w 0 since x x and x y is onto x for some 1 2 k in particular there exists a k such that x 1 k x w therefore a w a 1 k x v e 1 1 k x v by the monotone property of positive operator valued measures notice that 1 1 k x n n for 1 n k by an induction argument one can show that e n n for 1 n k r 1 r k r k r 1 0 hence a w v e 1 1 k x v v r 1 r k r k r 1 v 0 which is a contradiction to the fact that a w 0 3 acknowledgements i would like to recognize my graduate advisor judith packer for her excellent guid ance during my time in graduate
