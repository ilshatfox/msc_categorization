metric space x admits an intrinsic isometry into en if and only if x is a pro euclidean space of rank at most n he then shows that either case implies that x has covering dimension n in this paper we extend this result to include embeddings namely we first prove that any pro euclidean space of rank at most n admits an intrinsic isometric embedding into e 2 n 1 we then discuss how petrunin s result implies a partial converse to this result 1 introduction in 5 petrunin proves the following theorem theorem 1 1 petrunin a compact metric space x admits an intrinsic 1 isometry into en if and only if x is a pro euclidean space of rank at most n either of these statements implies that dim x n where dim x denotes the covering dimension of x a metric space x is called a pro euclidean space of rank at most n if it can be represented as an inverse limit of a sequence of n dimensional euclidean polyhedra pi in this definition the inverse limit is taken in the category with objects metric spaces and morphisms short 2 maps so the limit lim pi x means that the sequence pi converges to x in both the topological and metric sense the morphisms being short maps means that all maps involved in the inverse system are short including the projection maps in 2 the following theorem is proved theorem 1 2 m let p be an n dimensional euclidean polyhedron let f p en be a short map and let 0 be arbitrary then there exists an intrinsic isometric embedding h p en which is an approximation of f meaning f x h x for all x x provided n 2 n 1 combining theorem 1 2 with some methods used by nash in 4 and petrunin in 5 we can prove the following theorem 1 3 let x be a compact pro euclidean space of rank at most n then x admits an intrinsic isometric embedding into e 2 n 1 theorem 1 3 extends half of theorem 1 1 to the case of intrinsic isometric embeddings what theorem 1 3 does not prove is that if x admits an intrinsic isometric embedding into e 2 n 1 then x is a pro euclidean space of rank at most n the main reason that theorem 1 3 does not say this date november 27 2013 key words and phrases differential geometry discrete geometry metric geometry euclidean polyhedra poly hedral space

euclidean space with rank at most n then dim x n but there are many metric spaces with covering dimension greater than n that admit intrinsic isometric embeddings into e 2 n 1 a simple example is the 2 n sphere a metric space x is a pro euclidean space of finite rank if x can be written as an inverse limit of a sequence of euclidean polyhedra pi and if there exists a natural number n such that dim pi n for all i again we require that the inverse limit take place in the category of metric spaces with short maps then what we can say by using theorems 1 1 and 1 3 is the following theorem 1 4 a compact metric space x admits an intrinsic isometric embedding into en for some n if and only if x is a pro euclidean space of finite rank acknowledgements this paper combines the results of 5 and 2 both of these papers make great use of a result due to a akopyan akopyan s original proof of his result can be found in 1 an english version of his proof can be found in 3 during the preparation of this paper the author received tremendous support from both binghamton university and alfred university this research was partially supported by the nsf grant of tom farrell and pedro ontaneda dms 1103335 2 proof of theorem 1 3 proof of theorem 1 3 let x be a pro euclidean space of rank at most n and let pi j i be the inverse system associated to x where pi is an n dimensional euclidean polyhedron for all i for each i let i x pi be the projection map remember that every map associated with this system is short given i 1 0 and a pl intrinsic isometric embedding fi pi e 2 n 1 by theorem 1 2 there exists a pl intrinsic isometric embedding fi 1 pi 1 e 2 n 1 such that fi 1 x fi i 1 i x e 2 n 1 i 1 for all x pi 1 then define hi fi i for all i to keep track of all of the maps involved please see figure 1 what needs to be shown is that the values for i can be chosen in such a way that the sequence hi i 0 converges uniformally to an intrinsic isometric embedding the fact that the sequence i i 1 can be chosen so that the sequence hi i 0 converges uniformally to an intrinsic isometry is identical to the proof by petrunin in 5 and is omitted here to see that we can choose the sequence i i 1 so that the sequence hi i 0 converges to an embedding just consider the collection of sets i x x x x dx x x 2 i since x lim pi and because i is compact for every i n there exists i such that i x 6 i x for all x x i for every i choose i i 1 which satisfies the above thus hi x 6 hi x for all x x i then we let i inf hi x hi x e 2 n 1 x x i 0 if we choose i 1 4 min i i 1 then no point pair in i can come together in the limit eventually any pair of distinct points is contained in some i which completes the proof intrinsic isometric embeddings of pro euclidean spaces 3
