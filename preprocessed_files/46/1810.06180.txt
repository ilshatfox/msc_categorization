conjecture for nondegenerate periodic hamiltonians on general closed symplectic manifolds m via a direct piunikhin salamon schwarz morphism our constructions are based on a coherent polyfold description for moduli spaces of pseudoholomorphic curves in a family of symplectic manifolds degenerating from cp 1 m to c m and c m as developed by fish hofer wysocki zehnder as part of the symplectic field theory package to make the paper self contained we include all polyfold assumptions describe the coherent perturbation iteration in detail and prove an abstract regularization theorem for moduli spaces with evaluation maps relative to a countable collection of submanifolds the 2011 sketch of this proof was joint work with peter albers joel fish 1 introduction let m be a closed symplectic manifold and h s 1 m r a periodic hamiltonian function it induces a time dependent hamiltonian vector field xh s 1 m tm given by xh t x dh t we denote the set of contractible periodic orbits by 1 p h s 1 m t xh t t and is contractible and note that periodic orbits can be identified with the fixed points of the time 2 flow 2 h m m of xh here we choose the convention s 1 r 2 z i e period 2 for ease of notation later on we call this hamiltonian system nondegenerate if 2 h idm is transverse to the diagonal and hence cuts out the fixed points transversely in particular this guarantees a finite set of periodic orbits arnold a conjectured in the 1960 s that the minimal number of critical points of a morse function onm is also a lower bound for the number of periodic orbits of a nondegenerate hamiltonian system as above in this strict form the arnold conjecture has been confirmed for riemann surfaces e and tori cz a weaker form is accessible by floer theory introduced by floer f 2 f 3 in the 1980 s it constructs a chain complex generated by p h that can be compared with the morse complex generated by the critical points of a morse function when floer homology is well defined it is usually independent of the hamiltonian and on a compact symplectic manifold can in fact be identified with morse homology which is also independent of the morse function and computes the singular homology using this approach the following nondegenerate homological form of the arnold conjecture was first proven by floer f 1 f 4 in the absence of pseudoholomorphic spheres theorem 1 1 let m be a closed symplectic manifold and h s 1 m r a nondegenerate periodic hamiltonian function then p h dimm i 0 dimhi m q floer s proof was later extended to general closed symplectic manifolds hs o fo lt and in the presence of pseudoholomorphic spheres of negative chern number requires abstract regularizations of the moduli spaces of floer trajectories since perturbations of the geometric structures may not yield regular moduli spaces see e g mw further generalizations and alternative proofs have been published in the meantime using a variety of regularization methods the purpose of this note is to provide a general and maximally accessible proof of theorem 1 1 using an abstract perturbation scheme provided by the polyfold theory of hofer wysocki zehnder hwz following an approach by piunikhin salamon schwarz pss based on sc 2 and building on polyfold descriptions of gromov witten moduli spaces hwz 1 as well as their degenerations in symplectic field theory egh fh 4 remark 1 2 since the polyfold descriptions of sft moduli spaces fh 1 fh 4 are not completely published we formulate them as assumptions 4 3 5 5 6 3 while these descriptions of four kinds of 1 http arxiv org abs 1810 06180 v 3 2 benjamin filippenko katrin wehrheim moduli spaces and their relations involve a lot of structures bundles sections evaluation maps and compatible immersions from cartesian products to boundaries they will be familiar from classical descriptions of moduli spaces of pseudoholomorphic curves our assumptions in polyfold theoretic terms formalize the well known fact that the moduli spaces have local descriptions in terms of fredholm sections and gluing theorems which polyfold theory interprets as global smooth struc ture within an appropriately generalized differential geometry indeed transition maps between the natural infinite dimensional local models fail to be classically differentiable for only two reasons which polyfold theory resolves as explained in e g ffgw 2 and hwz 1 2 1 actions of repa rameterization groups satisfy the new notion of scale smoothness for maps between banach spaces neighbourhoods of maps with broken or nodal domains are given local polyfold models as the image of a retraction modulo a finite group action in the case of isotropy which becomes scale smooth after adjusting the smooth structure near nodal curves in deligne mumford spaces with this un derstood there is little doubt in the existence of polyfold descriptions for moduli spaces the much more audacious claim of polyfold theory is the existence of an abstract perturbation scheme for moduli spaces that are described as zero set of a scale smooth section over a polyfold however this claim is fully substantiated in hwz so the goal of this paper is to demonstrate the use of this abstract perturbation scheme once polyfold descriptions for the basic building blocks of moduli spaces are given we moreover chose this structure to give an example of how rigorous and transparent proofs can be written at a time when parts of their foundation are unpublished or in question to describe our proof let cf p h be the floer chain group of the hamiltonian h with coefficients in the novikov field see 2 let cm d be the morse complex with coefficients in associated to a morse function f m r and a suitable metric on m see 3 then we will prove the following in lemma 4 9 definition 5 8 and lemmas 6 4 6 5 6 6 theorem 1 3 there exist linear maps pss cm cf ssp cf cm cm cm and h cm cm such that the following holds i is a chain map that is d d ii is a module isomorphism iii h is a chain homotopy between ssp pss and that is ssp pss d h h d here we view the floer chain group cf as a vector space over not as a chain complex and in particular do not consider a floer differential thus we are neither constructing a floer homology for h nor identifying it with the morse homology of f however the algebraic structures in theorem 1 3 suffice to deduce the homological arnold conjecture for the hamiltonian h as follows proof of theorem 1 1 denote the sum of the betti numbers k dimm i 0 dimhi m q let cmq dq be the morse complex over q as defined in 3 then by the isomorphism of singular and morse homology there exist c 1 ck cmq that are cycles dqci 0 and linearly independent in the morse homology over q since the morse differential d cm cm is given by linear extension of dq from cmq cm the chains c 1 ck cm are also cycles dci dqci 0 and linearly independent in the morse homology over by theorem 1 3 i ii induces an isomor phism h hm hm on homology this in particular implies that c 1 ck hm are also linearly independent in homology that is for any 1 k we have 2 k i 1 i ci im d 1 k 0 we now show that pss c 1 pss ck cf are linearly independent proving p h k since the elements of p h generate cf by definition this proves the theorem let 1 k be a tuple such that k i 0 i pss ci 0 then we deduce from theorem 1 3 iii that k i 0 i ci k i 0 i ssp pss ci dh ci h dci ssp k i 0 i pss ci k i 0 i dh ci d k i 0 i h ci a polyfold proof of the arnold conjecture 3 which implies 1 k 0 by 2 this algebraically minimalistic approach of deducing the homological arnold conjecture from the existence of maps pss and ssp whose composition is chain homotopic to an isomorphism on the morse complex was developed in 2011 discussions of the second author peter albers and joel fish with mohammed abouzaid and thomas kragh these were prompted by our observation that proofs of floer homology equals morse homology require equivariant transversality which is generally obstructed even for equivariant sections of finite rank bundles thus our goal was a proof using the least amount of geometric insights or new abstract tools beyond this we expect the pss approach to yield an isomorphism between floer and morse homology and spectral invariants sc 3 on all closed symplectic manifolds using refinements of polyfold theory described in remark 1 4 to maximize accessibility we begin with reviews of the pertinent facts on the novikov field 2 and morse trajectories 3 the proof of theorem 1 3 then proceeds by constructing the pss and ssp maps in 4 from curves in c m constructing the isomorphism and chain homotopy h in 5 from curves in cp 1 m and its degeneration into c m and c m and proving their algebraic relations in 6 by constructing coherent perturbations we give a detailed account of these iterative constructions in the proofs of lemma 6 4 and 6 6 while these results should be contained in fh 4 neck stretching is not addressed in fh 1 and it seemed timely to give the proof in a case whose structure is vastly simplified by the absence of trivial cylinders compared with fh 1 3 5 to strike a balance between technical details and maximal accessibility we have clearly labeled all such technical work readers willing to view polyfold theory as a black box can save 20 pages by skipping these parts for readers new to polyfold theory we provide in appendix a a summary of all notions and facts that are necessary for the present application here we moreover establish in theorem a 9 a relative perturbation result that should be of independent interest it allows one to bring moduli spaces with an evaluation map into general position to a countable collection of submanifolds we combine this result with fi to construct polyfold descriptions of the pss moduli spaces as fiber products of sft moduli spaces with the morse trajectory spaces constructed in w 2 remark 1 4 i there are essentially two approaches to the general arnold conjecture as stated in theorem 1 1 the first developed by f 4 and used verbatim in hs o fo lt is to establish the independence of floer homology from the hamiltonian function and to identify the floer complex for a c 2 small s 1 invariant hamiltonian h m r with the morse complex for h this requires s 1 equivariant transversality to argue that isolated floer trajectories must be s 1 invariant hence morse trajectories a conceptually transparent construction of equivariant and transverse perturbations under transversality assumptions at the fixed point set which are met in this setting can be found in z assuming a polyfold description of floer trajectories ii the second approach to theorem 1 1 by pss is to construct a direct isomorphism between the floer homology of the given hamiltonian and the morse homology for some unrelated morse function two chain maps pss cm cf ssp cf cm between the morse and floer complexes are constructed frommoduli spaces of once punctured perturbed holomorphic spheres with one marking evaluating to the unstable resp stable manifold of a morse critical point and with the given hamiltonian perturbation of the cauchy riemann operator on a cylindrical neighbourhood of the puncture then gluing and degeneration arguments are used to argue that both pss ssp and ssp pss are chain homotopic to the identity and hence ssp is the inverse of pss on homology however sphere bubbling can obstruct these arguments in the first chain homotopy it creates an ambiguity in the choice of nodal gluing when the intermediate morse trajectory shrinks to zero length we expect to be able to avoid this by arguing that index 1 solutions generically avoid codimension 2 strata another classical fact in differential geometry that should generalize to polyfold theory the second chain homotopy is as claimed in theorem 1 3 iii but with id which requires arguing that the only isolated holomorphic spheres with two marked points evaluating to an unstable and stable manifold are constant this again requires s 1 equivariant transversality which we expect to be able to achieve with the techniques in z iii theorem 1 3 is proven by following the pss approach as above but avoiding the use of new polyfold technology such as equivariant or strata avoiding perturbations in particular is the map 4 benjamin filippenko katrin wehrheim that results from counting holomorphic spheres that intersect an unstable and stable manifold its invertibility is deduced from an upper triangular argument iv the techniques in this paper combining existing perturbation technology with the polyfold descriptions of sft moduli spaces would also allow one to define the floer differential prove d 2 0 establish independence of floer homology from the hamiltonian and other geometric data and prove that pss and ssp are chain maps then the chain homotopy between ssp pss and the isomorphism implies that pss is injective and ssp surjective on homology however proving that pss and ssp are isomorphisms on homology or directly identifying the floer complex of a small s 1 invariant hamiltonian with its morse complex requires the techniques discussed in ii moreover a proof of independence of floer homology from the choice of abstract perturbation would require a study of the algebraic consequences of self gluing floer trajectories in expected dimension 1 during a homotopy of perturbations as developed in the a setting in lw we thank peter albers and joel fish for helping develop the outline of this project and edi zehn der for asking the initial question the project was further supported by various discussions with mohammed abouzaid helmut hofer thomas kragh kris wysocki and zhengyi zhou crucial financial support was provided by nsf grants dms 1442345 and dms 1708916 2 the novikov field we use the following novikov field associated to the symplectic manifold m let h 2 m denote integral homology and consider the map h 2 m r given by the pairing a a for a h 2 m the image of this pairing is a finitely generated additive subgroup of the real numbers denoted im h 2 m r the novikov field is the set of formal sums r rt r where t is a formal variable with rational coefficients r q which satisfy the finiteness condition c r r r 6 0 r c the multiplication is given by r rt r s st s t r s t r s t t this defines a field by hs thm 4 1 and the discussion preceding the theorem in hs 4 the key being that is a finitely generated subgroup of r we will moreover make use of the following generalization of the invertibility of triangular matrices with nonzero diagonal entries lemma 2 1 let m ij 1 i j be a square matrix with entries ij in the novikov field suppose that ij r r 0 ij r t r with ij 0 0 for i 6 j and ii 0 6 0 then m is invertible proof since is a field invertibility ofm is equivalent to det m 6 0 write det m r rt r for some r q it suffices to show that 0 6 0 we proceed by induction on the size of the matrix m in the 1 base case when m is a 1 1 matrix m 11 we have det m 11 r rt r with r 11 r so 0 11 0 6 0 now suppose that m is size for some 1 and inductively assume that for any size 1 1 matrix n satisfying the hypotheses of the lemma we have det n r n r t r with n 0 6 0 for 1 j let c 1 j denote the matrix obtained by deleting the first row and j th column of m then n c 11 is an 1 1 matrix that satisfies the hypotheses of the lemma and the cofactor expansion of the determinant yields det m 11 det n j 2 1 1 j 1 j det c 1 j by hypothesis all entries of m are of the form ij r 0 ij r t r since the determinants det n and det c 1 j are polynomials of those entries they are of the same form with zero coefficients for t r with r 0 since we moreover have 1 j 0 0 for j 2 by hypothesis it follows that a polyfold proof of the arnold conjecture 5 the constant term i e the coefficient on t 0 of 1 j det c 1 j is 0 hence the constant term of det m rt r is 0 11 0 n 0 where n 0 6 0 by induction and 11 0 6 0 by hypothesis this implies det m 0 6 0 and thus finishes the proof 3 the morse complex and half infinite morse trajectories this section reviews the construction of the morse complex as well as the compactified spaces of half infinite morse trajectories which will appear in all our moduli spaces 3 1 euclidean morse smale pairs the morse complex can be constructed for any morse smale pair of function and metric on a closed smooth manifold m and more general spaces however we will also work with half infinite morse trajectories and to obtain natural manifold with boundary and corner structures on these we will restrict ourselves to the following special setting definition 3 1 a euclidean morse smale pair on a closed manifold m is a pair f g con sisting of a smooth function f c m r and a riemannian metric g on m satisfying a normal form and transversality condition as follows i for every critical point p crit f of index p n 0 there exists a local chart to a neighbourhood of 0 rn such that f x 1 xn f p 1 2 x 21 x 2 p 1 2 x 2 p 1 x 2 n g dx 1 dx 1 dxn dxn ii for every pair of critical points p q crit f the intersection of unstable and stable mani folds is transverse w p w q remark 3 2 euclidean morse smale pairs exist on every closed manifold and for any given morse function indeed given any morse function f and metric g there are arbitrarily c 0 small perturba tions g of g in any neighborhood of the critical points of f such that f g satisfies definition 3 1 i see e g bh prp 1 furthermore any l 2 generic perturbation g of g on annuli around the critical points yields a pair f g that additionally satisfies definition 3 1 ii and hence is a euclidean morse smale pair see e g bh prp 2 or sc 1 prp 2 24 3 2 the morse complex for distinct critical points p 6 p crit f the space of unbroken morse trajectories which are necessarily nonconstant is m p p r m f lim s s p r 3 w p w p r w p w p f 1 c it is canonically identified with the intersection of unstable and stable manifold modulo the r action given by the flow of f or their intersection with a level set for any regular value c f p f p both formulations equip it with a canonical smooth structure of dimension p p 1 see e g sc 1 2 4 1 moreover any choice of orientation of the unstable manifolds w p for all p crit f induces orientations on the trajectory spaces m p p by e g wb 3 4 then the morse chain complex of f g is obtained by counting with signs induced by the orientations the zero dimensional spaces of unbroken trajectories 4 cmq p crit f q p dq p p p 1 m p p p it computes the singular homology of m see e g sc 1 4 3 more precisely the morse complex is graded cmq i 0 dimm cim by morse indices cim p iq p and with di dq cim we have hi m q ker di imdi 1 the pss and ssp morphisms will be constructed on the morse complex with coefficients in the novikov field from section 2 5 cm cm cmq p crit f p 6 benjamin filippenko katrin wehrheim with differential d d the linear extension of dq defined as above on generators this complex is naturally graded with differential of degree 1 6 c m dimm i 0 cim cim p i p d cim ci 1 m 3 3 compactified spaces of morse trajectories our construction of moduli spaces will also make use of the following spaces of half infinite unbroken morse trajectories for p crit f m m p 0 m f lim s s p m p m 0 m f lim s s p these will be equipped with smooth structures of dimension dimm m p dimm p resp dimm p m p by the evaluation maps ev m m p m 7 0 ev m p m m 7 0 which identify the trajectory spaces with the unstable and stable manifolds m m p w p resp m p m w p note that these spaces contain constant trajectories at a critical point p m m p and p m p m to compactify these trajectory spaces in a manner compatible with morse theory we cannot simply take the closure of the unstable or stable manifold w p m but must add broken trajectories involving the bi infinite morse trajectories the bi infinite trajectories from 3 which appear in such a compactification are always nonconstant i e between distinct critical points p 6 p so unlike constant half infinite length trajectories our constructions will not involve constant bi infinite trajectories and we simplify subsequent notation by setting m p p for all p crit f with that we first introduce spaces of k fold broken half or bi infinite morse trajectories for k n 0 and p crit f m m p k p 1 pk crit f m m p 1 m p 1 p 2 m pk p m p m k p 1 pk crit f m p p 1 m p 1 p 2 m pk m 7 m p p k p 1 pk crit f m p p 1 m p 1 p 2 m pk p now the compactifications of the spaces of half or bi infinite morse trajectories are given by m m p k n 0 m m p k m p m k n 0 m p m k m p p k n 0 m p p k with topology given by the hausdorff distance between the images of the broken or unbroken trajec tories compactness of these spaces is proven analogously to the bi infinite morse trajectory spaces in e g bh prp 3 using w 2 lemma 3 5 moreover w 2 lemma 3 3 shows that the evaluation maps extend continuously to ev m m p m 0 1 k 7 0 0 8 ev m p m m 0 k 1 k 7 k 0 smooth structures on these spaces are obtained by the following variation of a folk theorem which is proven in w 2 using techniques similar to those of bh for the bi infinite trajectory spaces theorem 3 3 let f g be a euclidean morse smale pair and p crit f then m m p m p m and m p p are compact separable metric spaces and carry the structure of a smooth manifold with corners of dimension dimm m p dimm p dimm p m p and dimm p p p p 1 their k th boundary stratum is km m k moreover the evaluation maps 8 are smooth for reference we recall the definition of a manifold with boundary and corners and its strata definition 3 4 a smooth manifold with corners of dimension n n 0 is a second countable hausdorff space m together with a maximal atlas of charts m u v 0 n i e homeomorphisms between open sets such that u m whose transition maps are smooth for k 0 n the k th boundary stratum km is the set of all x m such that for some and hence every chart the point x 0 n has k components equal to 0 a polyfold proof of the arnold conjecture 7 remark 3 5 i to orient the morse trajectory spaces in theorem 3 3 we fix a choice of orien tation on each unstable manifold w p m p m for p crit f and orient w p m m p such that tpm tpw tpw induces the orientation on m given by the symplectic form this also induces orientations on m p p w p w p r that are coherent by e g wb 3 4 in the sense that the top strata of the oriented boundaries of the compactified morse tra jectory spaces are products 1 m q crit f o q m q m q with universal signs o q 1 we compute the relevant cases for m m q m q p 1 m m p with dimm q p 0 the sign is o m q p 1 p 1 indeed a point in m q p is positively oriented if tw q f nw p here we identify np w p tp w p and the outer normal direction is represented by f so that the sign arises from tw p tw p tw q tw q f tw p tw q tw p 1 1 p f tw q tm q p similarly form p q m q m 1 m p m with dimm p q 0 the sign is o p q m 1 since f is an outer normal and tw p f tw q when tm p q 0 ii for computational purposes in 6 3 we determine the fiber products of the compactified morse trajectory spaces of critical points p p crit f with the same morse index p p m p m ev evm m p m p m m m p ev ev p 6 p p p p p to verify this recall that the compactifications m p m and m m p are constructed in 7 via broken flow lines involving bi infinite morse trajectories in m pi pi 1 which are defined to be nonempty only for pi pi 1 so we have m p p 1 m pk m m p m only for pk p and m m p 1 m pk p m m p only for p 1 p and thus the image of the evaluation maps are contained in unions of unstable stable manifolds ev m p m w p q p w q ev m m p w p q p w q since the intersections w q w q are transverse by the morse smale condition they can be nonempty only for q dimm q dimm so this intersection is empty whenever q q thus for q p p q in the above images we have empty intersectionsw q w q as well as w q w p and w p w q this proves ev m p m ev m m p w p w p and for p 6 p this intersection is empty by transversality in 3 lastly for p p we havew p w p p since gradient flows do not allow for nontrivial self connecting trajectories this proves m p m ev evm m p p p 4 the pss and ssp maps in this section we construct the pss and ssp morphisms in theorem 1 3 between morse and floer complexes as in the introduction we fix a closed symplectic manifold m and a smooth function h s 1 m r this induces a time dependent hamiltonian vector field xh s 1 tm which we assume to be nondegenerate thus it has a finite set of contractible periodic orbits denoted by p h as in 1 we moreover pick a morse function f m r and denote its again finite set of critical points by crit f then we will work with the floer and morse complexes over the novikov field from section 2 cf p h cm p crit f p and construct the linear maps pss cm cf ssp cf cm from moduli spaces which we introduce in 4 1 we provide these moduli spaces with a compactification and polyfold description in 4 2 and in 4 3 rigorously construct the pss ssp map by using polyfold perturbations to obtain well defined but still choice dependent counts of compactified and perturbed moduli spaces 8 benjamin filippenko katrin wehrheim 4 1 the piunikhin salamon schwarz moduli spaces to construct the moduli spaces we need to make further choices as follows let j be an compatible almost complex structure on m then the cauchy riemann operator on maps u m parametrized by a riemann surface with complex structure j is ju 1 2 du j u du j 0 1 u tm let g be a metric on m such that f g is a euclidean morse smale pair as in definition 3 1 it exists by remark 3 2 let 0 0 1 be a smooth cutoff function with 0 1 0 0 and e 1 then we define the anti holomorphic vector field valued 1 form yh 0 1 c tm in polar coordinates yh re i x 1 2 r jxh x r 1 dr xh x d in the notation of ms 8 1 we have yh xh 0 1 given by the anti holomorphic part of the 1 form with values in hamiltonian vector fields xh which arises from the 1 form with values in smooth functions h 1 c c m given by h re i r h d the vector field valued 1 form yh encodes the floer equation on both the positive cylindrical end z c z e 1 s 1 and the negative end z e 1 s 1 where 1 as follows the reparametrization v s t u e s it of a map u c m satisfies the floer equation s j t v s t jxh t v s t iff ju z yh z u z for each p h fix a smooth disk u d 2 m with u d 2 e it t we denote the oriented complex plane by c c i c and denote its reversed complex structure and orientation by c c i then for u c m with limr u re it t denote by u u cp 1 m the continuous map given by gluing u to u where the denotes the orientation of d 2 by abuse of language we will call a u u u u cp 1 h 2 m the homology class represented by u moreover we denote by u d 2 d 2 m the graph of u then the graph u c c m z 7 z u z glues with u to a continuous map representing u u a cp 1 a h 2 cp 1 m or more precisely a cp 1 pt pt a now the condition v u a makes sense for other maps v c c m with the same asymptotic behaviour and we say v represents a in fact we will suppress the notation a and label spaces with a as this specifies the topological type of v given such choices the choice dependent morphisms pss cm cf and ssp cf cm will be constructed from the following moduli spaces for critical points p crit f periodic orbits p h and a h 2 m m p a u c m u 0 w p ju yh u lim r u reit t u u a m p a u c m u 0 w p ju yh u lim r u re it t u u a each of these moduli spaces can be described as the zero set of a fredholm

decay condition limr u re it t but not necessarily satisfying the perturbed cauchy riemann equation ju yh u then j yh is a fredholm section of index i p a cz 2 c 1 a dimm 2 p 9 i p a cz 2 c 1 a dimm 2 p where cz is the conley zehnder index with respect to a trivialization of u tm as in e g sc 2 c 1 a is the first chern class of tm j paired with a and p is the morse index of p crit f if the moduli spaces were compact oriented manifolds then we could define pss and analogously ssp by a signed count of the index 0 solutions pss p m p a t a where the sum is over p h and a h 2 m with i p a 0 in many cases if sphere bubbles of negative chern number can be excluded this compactness and regularity can be achieved a polyfold proof of the arnold conjecture 9 by a geometric perturbation of the equation e g in the choice of almost complex structure in general obtaining well defined counts of the moduli spaces requires an abstract regularization scheme we will use polyfold theory to replace m p a by a count of 0 dimensional perturbed moduli spaces in the presence of sphere bubbles with nontrivial isotropy the perturbations will be multi valued yielding rational counts remark 4 1 compactness or rather gromov compactifications of the moduli spaces m p a and m p a will result from energy estimates ms remark 8 1 7 for solutions of ju yh u 10 e u 1 2 c du xh u c u rh u u k here the curvature rh dvolc dh 1 2 h h h dr d has finite hofer norm rh c maxrh maxrh 0 s 1 r maxx m h x minx m h x d dr since has compact support in 1 e since moreover p h is a finite set we obtain the above estimate with a finite constantk rh max p h d 2 u thus the energy of the perturbed pseudoholomorphic maps in each of our moduli spaces will be bounded since we fix u u a now sft compactness behwz asserts that for any c 0 the set of solutions of bounded energy u c m ju yh u limr u re it t e u c is compact up to breaking and bubbling this compactness will be stated rigorously in polyfold terms in assumption 5 5 ii 4 2 polyfold description of moduli spaces we will obtain a polyfold description for the moduli spaces in 4 1 by a fiber product construction motivated by the natural identifications 11 m p a m p m ev evm a m p a m a ev evm m p this couples the half infinite morse trajectory spaces from 3 3 with a space of perturbed pseudo holomorphic maps m a u c m ju yh u lim r u

by compact manifolds or more general regularizations which still carry virtual fundamental classes polyfold theory offers a universal regularization approach after requiring a compactification m m of the moduli space and a description of the compact moduli space m 1 0 as zero set of a sc fredholm section b e of a strong polyfold bundle for an introduction to the language hwz used here see appendix a the morse trajectory spaces are compactified and given a smooth structure in theorem 3 3 the gromov compactification and perturbation theory for 12 will be achieved by identifying theses spaces with moduli spaces that appear in symplectic field theory sft as introduced in egh compactified in behwz cm 1 and given a polyfold description in fh 4 here we identify u c m with the map to its graph u c c

the asymptotic requirement is dc m v re i t t 0 r t 0 for some t 0 s 1 as r for the graphs r t re it t of the orbit parametrized by s 1 z r c 1 for definitions of these notions see cm 1 2 for c m the positive symplectization end is r s 1 m c m r x 7 er i x after reversing orientation on c there is an analogous negative end r s 1 m c m 2 here we have implicitly chosen asymptotic markers that fix a parametrization of each reeb orbit 10 benjamin filippenko katrin wehrheim to express the evaluation 13 in sft terms note that a holomorphic map in the given homology class intersects the holomorphic submanifold 0 m in a unique point 3 so we can fix the point 0 c in the domain where this intersection occurs and rewrite the moduli space m a v m sft a v 0 0 m aut c 0 with a slicing condition and quotient by the biholomorphisms which fix 0 c thus we rewrite 11 into the fiber products over c m m p a m p m 0 ev ev m sft a 14 m p a m sft a ev 0 ev m m p using evaluation maps on the sft moduli space with one marked point ev m sft a m sft a aut c 0 c m v 7 v 0 15 now we will obtain a polyfold description of the pss ssp moduli spaces 14 by the slicing construc tion of fi applied to polyfold descriptions of the sft moduli spaces m sft a compactified as space of pseudoholomorphic buildings with one marked point this result is outlined in fh 1 but to enable a self contained proof of our results we formulate it as assumption where we use c c s 1 z c z 1 as target factor for a simplified evaluation map as explained in the following remark remark 4 2 note that the compactified moduli space m sft a in view of the noncompact target c m contains broken curves v c r s 1 r s 1 m we do not need a precise description of this compactification beyond the fact that it exists and is cut out by a sc fredholm section but it affects the formulation of the evaluation maps v z 0 7 v z 0 for a marked point z 0 that v might map to a cylinder factor r s 1 m m we will simplify the resulting sc evaluation with varying target being developed in fh 4 to a continuous evaluation map ev m sft a c into the compactified target c for that purpose we topologize c z 1 as a disk via a diffeomorphism c z 1 rei 7 f r ei induced by a diffeomorphism f 0 0 1 that is the identity near 0 and its extension to a homeomorphism c z 1 via s 1 r 2 z z 1 7 e i then for any marked point z 0 r s 1 on a cylinder we project the evaluation v z 0 r s 1 m to s 1 m c m by forgetting the r factor the resulting simplified evaluation map will be unchanged and thus still sc when restricted to the open subset ev 1 c m of the ambient polyfold as stated in iii below this open subset inherits a scale smooth structure and still contains some broken curves just not those on which the marked point leaves the main component this suffices for our purposes since the fiber product construction uses the evaluation map only in an open set of curves v z 0 with v z 0 0 c in assumption 4 3 remark 4 4 and lemma 4 5 we introduce some of the polyfolds under con struction in fh 4 and their expected properties to describe these objects we introduce a significant amount of notation a summary of the types of curves in each polyfold and subsets thereof is dis played in table 1 for the reader s convenience assumption 4 3 there is a collection of oriented sc fredholm sections of strong polyfold bundles sft b sft a e sft a and continuous maps ev b sft a c m indexed by p h and a h 2 m with the following properties i the sections have fredholm index ind sft cz 2 c 1 a dimm 2 2 on b sft a resp ind sft cz 2 c 1 a dimm 2 2 on b sft a ii each zero set m sft a 1 sft 0 is compact and given any c r there are only finitely many a h 2 m with a c and nonempty zero set 1 sft 0 b sft a 6 3 for solutions in m sft a this follows from prc v c c being an entire function with a pole of order 1 at infinity prescribed by the asymptotics for j h holomorphic curves in the compactification it follows from positivity of intersections see e g cm 2 prop 7 1 a polyfold proof of the arnold conjecture 11 iii the sections sft have tame sc fredholm representatives in the sense of fi def 5 4 and the evaluation maps ev restrict on the open subsets b c sft a ev 1 c m b sft a to sc maps ev b c sft a c m which are sft compatibly submersive in the sense of definition a 4 finally this open subset contains the interior 0 b sft a b c sft a remark 4 4 i the polyfolds bundles and sections in assumption 4 3 are constructed for a closely analogous situation considering curves in r q with e g q s 1 m in fh 1 3 so while not needed for our proof we state the following properties for intuition equivalence classes under reparametrization of aut c 0 of smooth maps v c c m that satisfy v re it re it t for sufficiently large r 1 and represent the class v u cp 1 a form a dense subset b dense a b sft a contained in the interior on this subset the section is sft v v j h v and ev v is evaluation as in 15 the intersection of 1 sft 0 with this dense subset is contained in the moduli space m sft a from 15 the full moduli space m sft a is obtained by enlarging b dense a to include equivalence classes with supt s 1 dc m v re it re it t 0 as r however only classes with specific exponential decay of this quantity and related derivatives are contained in b sft a ii the sc smooth structure sc fredholm property and compactness is stated in fh 1 thm 3 4 the proof of polyfold and bundle structure outlined in fh 1 7 11 extends the construction of gromov witten polyfolds in hwz 1 by local models for punctures and neck stretching from fh 3 3 using the implanting method in fh 2 3 5 these constructions automatically satisfy the tameness assumed in iii the nonlinear fredholm property needs to be proven globally in close analogy to hwz 1 the fredholm index stated in i is computed in a local chart where the linearized section coincides with a restriction of the classical linearized cauchy riemann operator to a local slice to the reparametrization action the compactness properties follow from sft compactness of the moduli spaces behwz since the topology on the polyfolds given in fh 1 3 4 generalizes the notion of sft convergence orientations are constructed in fh 1 15 sc smoothness of the evaluation maps is proven analogously to hwz 1 thm 1 8 and their submersion property in iii which is used to construct fiber products in lemma 4 5 is proven as in fi ex 5 1 iii we also expect the existence of a direct polyfold description of the moduli space 12 in terms of a collection of sc fredholm sections b a e a with the same indices and submersive sc maps ev b a m with the following simplified properties the smooth maps u c m which equal u re it t for sufficiently large r 1 and represent the class a form a dense subset of b a that is contained in the interior on this subset the section is u ju yh u and the evaluation is ev u u 0 the inter section of 1 0 with this dense subset is contained in the moduli space m a from 12 the full moduli space m a is obtained by enlarging the dense subset to include maps with supt s 1 dm u re it t 0 as r however only maps with specific exponential decay of this quantity and related derivatives are contained in b a while such a construction should follow from the same construction principles as in fh 1 there is presently no writeup beyond w 1 which proves the fredholm property in a model case alter natively one could abstractly obtain this construction from restricting the setup in assumption 4 3 to subsets consisting of maps of the form v z z u z thus there would be no harm in using this property as intuitive guide for following our work with the abstract setup given one or another polyfold description of the naturally identified moduli spaces 12 or 15 and corresponding evaluation maps we will now extend the identifications 11 or 14 to a fiber product construction of polyfolds which will contain these pss ssp moduli spaces for p crit f 12 benjamin filippenko katrin wehrheim p h and a h 2 m we define the topological spaces b p a v m p m b sft a 0 ev ev v v m p m b c sft a 0 ev ev v 16 b p a v b sft a m m p 0 ev ev v v b c sft a m m p 0 ev ev v we will use fi to equip these spaces with natural polyfold structures and show that the pullbacks of the sections sft by the projections to b sft a yield sc fredholm sections whose zero sets are compactifications of the pss ssp moduli spaces this will require a shift in levels which is of technical nature as each m level bm b contains the dense smooth level b bm which itself contains the moduli space m 1 0 b see remark a 3 lemma 4 5 for any p crit f p h and a h 2 m there exist open subsets b p a b p a 1 and b p a b p a 1 which contain the smooth levels b a of the fiber products 16 and inherit natural polyfold structures the smooth level of their interior is 4 0 b p a m p m 0 ev ev 0 b c sft a 0 b p a 0 b c sft a ev 0 ev m m p moreover pullback of the sc fredholm sections of strong polyfold bundles sft b sft a e sft a under the projection b a b sft a induces sc fredholm sections of strong polyfold bundles p a b p a e p a resp p a b p a e p a of index i p a resp i p a given in 9 their zero sets contain 5 the moduli spaces from 4 1 p a 1 0 m p m 0 ev ev sft 1 0 m p a p a 1 0 sft 1 0 ev 0 ev m m p m p a finally each zero set a 1 0 is compact and given any p crit f p h and c r there are only finitely many a h 2 m with a c and nonempty zero set a 1 0 6 proof we will follow fi cor 7 3 to construct the pss polyfold bundle and sc fredholm section p a in detail and note that the construction of the ssp section p a is analogous consider an ep groupoid representative x x x of the polyfold b sft a with source and target maps denoted s t x x together with a strong bundle p w x over the m polyfold x and a structure map xs pw x such that the pair p is a strong bundle over x representing the polyfold bundle e sft a b sft a in addition consider a sc fredholm section functor ssft x w of p that represents sft the ep groupoid x and the bundle p are tame since they represent a tame polyfold and a tame bundle respectively moreover ssft is a tame sc fredholm section in the sense of fi def 5 4 by assumption 4 3 iii we view the morse moduli space m p m as the object space of an ep groupoid with morphism space another copy of m p m and with unit map a diffeomorphism that is the only morphisms are the identity morphisms the unique rank 0 bundle over m p m is a strong bundle in the ep groupoid sense and the zero section of this bundle is a tame sc fredholm section functor next note that b p a v m p m x ev v 0 m m p m xev is represented within the open subset xev ev 1 c m x and the corresponding full ep subgroupoid x ev of x which represent the open subset b c sft a x and by assumption 4 3 iii the restricted evaluation ev xev c m is sc and ssft compatibly submersive see definition a 4 denote by ev 0 m p m c m 7 0 ev the product of the trivial map to 0 c and the morse evaluation map we claim that the product map ev 0 ev m p m xev c m c m 4 here we can only make statements about the smooth level because we do not know what points of other levels are included in the fiber products this is sufficient for applications as the zero set of any sc fredholm section and its admissible perturbations is contained in the smooth level 5 as in remark 4 4 this identification is stated for intuition and will ultimately not be used in our proofs a polyfold proof of the arnold conjecture 13 notation description definition b dense a elements are equivalence classes under reparameterization by aut c 0 of smooth maps v c c m that satisfy v re it re it t for sufficiently large r 1 and represent the class v u cp 1 a remark 4 4 b sft a a polyfold with dense subset b dense a which contains the sft compactification m sft a of the moduli space in 15 assumption 4 3 remark 4 4 b c sft a the open subset of b sft a containing the curves whose evaluation at a marked point lands in c m rather than in a broken off cylinder r s 1 m see remark 4 2 assumption 4 3 iii b p a elements are pairs of a half infinite broken morse trajectory starting from the critical point p and a curve in b c sft a whose evaluation agrees with the end point of the morse trajectory 16 b p a elements are pairs of a half infinite broken morse trajectory ending at the critical point p and a curve in b c sft a whose evaluation agrees with the starting point of the morse trajectory 16 b p a open subset of b p a 1 containing m p a over which the section p a is sc fredholm possibly smaller than b p a 1 due to shrinking in fi cor 7 3 lemma 4 5 b p a open subset of b p a 1 containing m p a over which the section p a is sc fredholm lemma 4 5 table 1 summary of the polyfolds and their subsets introduced in this section is ssft compatibly transverse to the diagonal c m c m indeed given v ev 0 ev 1 let l trv x ev be a sc complement of the kernel of the linearization of ev at some v xev that satisfies the conditions for ssft compatible submersivity in definition a 4 w r t a coordinate change ev on a chart of xev then the subspace 0 l tr m p m t r v x ev satisfies the conditions for ssft compatible transversality of ev 0 ev with at v w r t the product change of coordinates id ev in a product chart on the cartesian product m p m xev see fi lem 7 1 7 2 for a discussion of the sc fredholm property on cartesian products next note that m p x ev 0 ev x ev represents the smooth level of the fiber product topologi cal space b p a so fi cor 7 3 yields an open neighbourhood x m p m ev 0 ev x ev 1 containing the smooth level m p x ev 0 ev x ev such that the full subcategory x x x of m p m x ev 1 is a tame ep groupoid and the pullbacks of p and ssft to x are a tame bundle and tame sc fredholm section here we used the fact that the smooth level m p x m p x of any finite dimensional manifold is the manifold itself see remark a 3 the tame ep groupoid x yields the claimed polyfold b p a x and similarly the pull backs of p and ssft through the projectionx x 1 define the claimed bundle and sc fredholm section p a b p a e p a the identification of the interior 0 b p a follows from the degeneracy index formula dx x 1 x 2 dm p m x 1 dx x 2 in fi cor 7 3 and the interior of the morse trajectory spaces 0 m p m m p m from theorem 3 3 the index formula in fi cor 7 3 yields ind p a ind sft p dim c m i p a since dimm p m p and ind sft cz 2 c 1 a 1 2 dimm 2 finally the zero set p a 1 0 is the fiber product of the zero sets as claimed as these are contained in the smooth level and the restriction to ev 1 0 m already restricts considerations to the domain xev from which the fiber product polyfold is constructed moreover p a 1 0 is compact as in fi cor 7 3 since both m p m and sft 1 0 are compact and both ev 0 and ev are continuous the final statement then follows from assumption 4 3 ii 14 benjamin filippenko katrin wehrheim 4 3 construction of the morphisms to construct the linear maps pss and ssp in theo rem 1 3 with relatively compact notation we index all moduli spaces from 4 1 by the two sets i p a p crit f p h a h 2 m i p a p crit f p h a h 2 m to simplify notation we then denote i i i and drop the superscripts from the polyfolds b b since lemma 4 5 provides each moduli spacem for i with a compactification and polyfold description m 1 0 we can apply hwz theorems 18 2 18 3 18 8 to obtain admissible regularizations of the moduli spaces and counts of the 0 dimensional perturbed solution spaces hwz 15 4 in the following sense here we denote by q q 0 the groupoid with only identity morphisms corollary 4 6 i for every i choice of neighbourhood of the zero sets 1 0 v b and choice of sc fredholm section functor s x w representing v there exists a pair n u controlling compactness in the sense of definition a 5 with s 1 0 u v for i with 1 0 we can choose u ii for every collection n u i of pairs controlling compactness there exists a collection w q i of n u admissible sc multisections in the sense of hwz defini tions 13 4 15 5 that are in general position relative to s i in the sense that each pair s is in general position as per hwz def 15 6 here admissibility in particular implies s x ru 0 and thus s 0 when 1 0 iii every collection of admissible sc multisections in general position from ii induces a col lection of compact tame branched ep groupoids s x q i in particular each perturbed zero set z x x s x 0 u x b is compact contained in the smooth level and carries the structure of a weighted branched orbifold of dimension i as in 9 moreover the inclusion in u and general position of implies that for i 0 or 1 0 the perturbed zero set z is empty iv for i with fredholm index i 0 and w q as in ii the perturbed zero set is contained in the interior z 0 b and yields a well defined count z x z o x s x q here o x 1 is determined by the orientation of as in hwz thm 6 3 if u b then this count is independent of the choice of admissible sc multisection v for every i with fredholm index i 1 and w q as in ii the boundary of the perturbed zero set is given by its intersection with the first boundary stratum of the polyfold z z 1 b with orientations o b x 1 induced by the boundary restriction b this implies z x z o b x s x 0 remark 4 7 i the statements in iv and v of corollary 4 6 require orientations of the sections for i by the fiber product construction in lemma 4 5 they do indeed inherit orientations from the orientations of the morse trajectory spaces in remark 3 5 the orientations of sft given in assumption 4 3 and an orientation convention for fiber products in practice we will construct the perturbations in corollary 4 6 by pullback of perturbations a p a h 2 m of the oriented sft sections sft thus it suffices to specify the orien tations of the regularized zero sets which is implicit in their identification with transverse fiber products of oriented spaces over the oriented manifold m z p a m p m ev 0 ev z a z p a z a ev ev 0 m m p orientations of the boundary restrictions in v are then induced by the orientations of z via oriented isomorphisms of the tangent spaces r z tz z tzz where z tzz is an exterior normal vector at z z a polyfold proof of the arnold conjecture 15 ii note that the counts in part iv of this corollary may well depend on the choice of the multi valued perturbations unless the ambient polyfold has no boundary b indeed although the moduli spacem is expected to have dimension 0 it may not be cut out transversely from the ambient polyfold b and moreover it may not be compact assumption 4 3 provides an inclusion in a compact set m 1 0 and the perturbation theory for sc fredholm sections of strong bundles then associates to 1 0 a perturbed zero set z b with weight function s z q 0 this process generally adds points on the boundary 1 0 rm b r 0 b which may or may not persist under variations of the perturbation the following construction of morphisms will depend on the choices of perturbations and orien tation convention see the previous remark as well as geometric data fixed in 4 1 and possibly the choice of polyfold construction in assumption 4 3 and ep groupoid representation in remark a 2 the algebraic properties in theorem 1 3 will be achieved in 6 for any given choice of geometric data by particular choices of ep groupoids and perturbations and an overall sign adjustment definition 4 8 given collections i of admissible sc multisections in general posi tion as in corollary 4 6 we define the maps pss cm cf and ssp cf cm to be the linear extension of pss p a i p a 0 z p a t a ssp p a i p a 0 z p a t a p lemma 4 9 the maps pss cm cf and ssp cf cm in definition 4 8 are well defined i e the coefficients take values in the novikov field defined in 2 proof to prove that pss is well defined we need to check finiteness of the following set for any p crit f p h and c r r h 2 m c a h 2 m a r z p a 6 0 here h 2 m r is given by pairing with the symplectic form onm and recall from lemma 4 5 that there are only finitely many homology classes a h 2 m with a c and 1 0 6 on the other hand the perturbations were chosen in corollary 4 6 iii iv so that z a 0 whenever 1 0 thus there are in fact only finitely many a h 2 m with a c and z a 6 0 which proves the required finiteness the proof for ssp is analogous 5 the chain homotopy maps in this section we construct linear maps cm cm and h cm cm on the morse complex over the novikov field given in 5 which appear in theorem 1 3 for that purpose we again fix a choice of geometric data as in 4 1 to construct moduli spaces in 5 1 and 5 2 we equip these with polyfold descriptions in 5 3 and define the maps h for admissible regular choices of perturbations in definitions 5 8 to obtain the algebraic properties claimed in theorem 1 3 i iii we will then construct particular coherent choices of perturbations in 6 5 1 moduli spaces for the isomorphism we will construct cm cm from the following moduli spaces for critical points p p crit f a h 2 m using the almost complex structure j and the unstable stable manifolds see 3 3 of the morse smale pair f g chosen in 4 1 17 m p p a u cp 1 m u 1 0 w p u 0 1 w p ju 0 u a note that a cylinder acts on this moduli space by reparametrization with biholomorphisms of cp 1 that fix the two points 1 0 0 1 however we do not quotient out this symmetry so describe these moduli spaces as the zero set of a fredholm section over a sobolev closure of the set of smooth maps u cp 1 m in the homology class u a satisfying the point constraints u 1 0 w p and u 0 1 w p this determines the fredholm index as 18 i p p a 2 c 1 a p p 16 benjamin filippenko katrin wehrheim as in 4 2 we will obtain a compactification and polyfold description of this moduli space by iden tifying it with a fiber product of morse trajectory spaces and a space of pseudoholomorphic curves in this case the space of parametrized j holomorphic spheres with evaluation maps for z 0 cp 1 evz 0 m a u cp 1 m ju 0 u a m u 7 u z 0 with this we can describe the moduli space 17 as fiber product with the half infinite morse trajectory spaces from 3 3 using z 0 1 0 and z 0 0 1 19 m p p a m p m ev ev z 0 m a ev z 0 ev m m p note here that we are not working with a gromov witten moduli space as we do not quotient by aut cp 1 this is due to the chain homotopy in theorem 1 3 iii which will result from identifying a compactification of m a with a boundary of the neck stretching moduli space msft a in 26 that appears in symplectic field theory egh for that purpose we identify a solution u cp 1 m with the map to its graph u cp 1 cp 1 m z 7 z u z as in ms 8 1 this yields is a bijection and homeomorphism in appropriate topologies m a m gw cp 1 a v cp 1 cp 1 m j v 0 v cp 1 a aut cp 1 between the cauchy riemann solution space form and the gromov witten moduli space for cp 1 m in class cp 1 a for the split almost complex structure j i j on cp 1 m to transfer the evaluation maps at z 0 1 0 and z 0 0 1 we keep track of these as unique marked points mapping to z 0 m and thus replace 19 by a fiber product over cp 1 m 20 m p p a m p m z 0 ev ev mgw a ev z 0 ev m m p this uses the evaluation maps from a gromov witten moduli space with two marked points 21 ev mgw a m gw cp 1 a aut cp 1 z 0 z 0 cp 1 m v 7 v z 0 where aut cp 1 z 0 z 0 denotes the set of biholomorphisms cp 1 cp 1 which fix z 0 z 0 the polyfold setup in hwz 1 theorems 1 7 1 10 1 11 for gromov witten moduli spaces now provides a strong polyfold bundle egw a bgw a and oriented sc fredholm section gw bgw a egw a that cuts out a compactification mgw a 1 gw 0 of mgw a here a dense subset of the base polyfold bgw a consists of aut cp 1 z 0 z 0 orbits of smooth maps v cp 1 cp 1 m in the homology class v cp 1 a which implicitly carries the two marked points z 0 cp 1 nodal curves in mgw a then explicitly come with the data of two marked points on their domain on the dense subset the section is given by gw v v j v the setup in hwz 1 theorem 1 8 moreover provides sc evaluation maps ev bgw a cp 1 m at the marked points which on the dense subset are given by ev v v z 0 thus we have given each factor in the fiber product 20 a compactification 6 that is either a manifold with corners given by the compactified morse trajectory spaces in theorem 3 3 or the compact zero set mgw a 1 gw 0 of a sc fredholm section in 5 3 we will combine the polyfold description of the gromov compactification of 21 with an abstract construction of fiber products in polyfold theory fi to obtain compactifications and polyfold descriptions of the moduli spaces then the construction of cm cm proceeds as in 4 3 the algebraic properties of in theorem 1 3 i and ii will follow from the boundary stratifications of the morse trajectory spaces m p m and m m p since the ambient polyfold bgw a has no boundary however this requires specific coherent choices of perturbations in 6 remark 5 1 gromov compactifications of the moduli spaces m p p a will result from the energy identity ms lemma 2 2 1 for solutions of ju 0 22 e u 1 2 c du 2 cp 1 u u 6 the term compactification applied to spaces of pseudoholomorphic curves is always to be understood as gromov compactification as mgw a mgw a may not be dense a polyfold proof of the arnold conjecture 17 this fixes the energy of solutions on each solution space m a and gromov compactness asserts that u cp 1 m ju 0 e u c is compact up to bubbling for any c 0 another consequence of 22 is that for a 0 we have no solutions m a except for a 0 h 2 m when the solution space is the space of constant maps m 0 u x x m m which is compact and cut out transversely translated to graphs in cp 1 m with two marked points this means mgw 0 cp 1 cp 1 m by adding two marked points in the domain that is z z x cp 1 cp 1 m corresponds to the equivalence class of graphs u x z 7 z x with two marked points z z cp 1 for z 6 z this tuple can be reparametrized to the fixed marked points z 0 z 0 cp 1 and then represents an aut cp 1 z 0 z 0 orbit for z z the tuple z z x corresponds to a stable map in mgw 0 given by the graph u x with a node at z z attached to a constant sphere with two distinct marked points this will be stated in polyfold terms in assumption 5 5 ii 5 2 moduli spaces for the chain homotopy h to construct the moduli spaces from which we will obtain h cm cm we again use the almost complex structure j and morse smale pair f g chosen in 4 1 in addition we fixed an anti holomorphic vector field valued 1 form yh 0 1 c tm that arises from the fixed hamiltonian function h s 1 m r and a choice of smooth cutoff function 0 0 1 with 0 1 0 0 and e 1 gluing this 1 form to another copy of yh over c with neck length r 0 in exponential coordinates yields the anti holomorphic vector field valued 1 form y rh 0 1 cp 1 tm that vanishes near 1 0 0 1 and on cp 1 r 1 0 0 1 1 rei r 0 s 1 is given by y rh 1 re i x 1 2 r r jxh x r 1 dr xh x d here r r re r 2 r 1 e r 2 is a smooth cutoff function r 0 0 1 that is identical to 1 on e 1 r 2 e r 2 1 and identical to 0 on 0 e r 2 e r 2 now perturbing the cauchy riemann operator on cp 1 by y rh yields the following moduli spaces for critical points p p crit f a h 2 m and r 0 mr p p a u cp 1 m u 1 0 w p u 0 1 w p ju y r h u u a and we will construct h from their union 23 m p p a r 0 mr p p a remark 5 2 each vector field valued 1 form y rh xhr 0 1 is in the notation of ms 8 1 in duced from the 1 form with values in smooth functions hr 1 cp 1 c m given by hr re i r r h d it is constructed so that it has the following properties i for r 0 we have y 0 h 0 so that the moduli space m 0 p p a m p p a is the same moduli space 17 from which will be constructed ii the restriction of any solution u mr p p a to the middle portion 1 z cp 1 e 1 r 2 z e r 2 1 1 r 2 r 2 1 s 1 satisfies the floer equation sv j tv jxh t v after reparametrization v s t u

p p a is the zero set of a fredholm section over a banach manifold 0 b where b is the same sobolev closure as in 5 1 of the set of smooth maps u cp 1 m in the homology class u a satisfying the point constraints u 1 0 w p and u 0 1 w p restricted to 0 b this is the fredholm section that cuts out m p p a in 17 with j 0 h j this determines the fredholm index as 24 i p p a i p p a 1 2 c 1 a p p 1 18 benjamin filippenko katrin wehrheim towards a compactification and polyfold description of these moduli spaces we again as in 4 2 5 1 ms 8 1 identify a solution u cp 1 m with the map to its graph moreover we again fix marked points z 0 1 0 z 0 0 1 to implement evaluation maps to express the conditions u z 0 w p this yields a homeomorphism in appropriate topologies between the moduli space 23 and the fiber product over cp 1 m with the half infinite morse trajectory spaces from 3 3 25 m p p a m p m z 0 ev ev msft a ev z 0 ev m m p compared with 20 this replaces the gromov witten moduli

implicitly include the two marked points z 0 cp 1 then for r the degeneration of the pde j r h v 0 is the neck stretching 7 considered more generally in symplectic field theory egh the evaluation maps from 21 directly generalize to 27 ev msft a cp 1 m v 7 v z 0 now as in 5 1 each factor in the fiber product 25 has natural compactifications either the com pactified morse trajectory spaces from theorem 3 3 or the compact zero set msft a 1 sft 0 of a sc fredholm section that we will introduce in 5 3 combined with the construction of fiber prod ucts in polyfold theory fi this will yield compactifications and polyfold descriptions of the moduli spaces 23 and the construction of h cm cm then again proceeds as in 4 3 establishing the algebraic properties in theorem 1 3 relating h with

this compactness will be stated rigorously in polyfold terms in assumption 5 5 ii 7 strictly speaking r 0 2 parametrizes a family of gromov witten moduli spaces for varying almost complex structure at r 2 the manifold s 1 m with its stable hamiltonian structure see 4 2 embeds as a stable hypersurface in cp 1 m then r 2 parametrizes the sft neck stretching a polyfold proof of the arnold conjecture 19 5 3 construction of the morphisms in this section we construct the linear maps cm cm and h cm cm analogously to 4 3 by first obtaining compactifications and polyfold descriptions for the moduli spaces in 5 1 and 5 2 as in 4 2 this construction is motivated by the fiber product descriptions of the moduli spaces in 20 25 which couple morse trajectory spaces from 3 3 with moduli spaces of pseudoholomorphic curves in cp 1 m via evaluation maps 21 27 polyfold descriptions of these moduli spaces and their properties are stated in the following assumption 5 5 for reference with proofs in hwz 1 resp outlined in fh 1 a summary of the types of curves in each polyfold and subsets thereof is displayed in table 2 here we formulate the evaluation map in the context of neck stretching as explained in the following remark using a splitting of the sphere as topological space with smooth structures on the complement of the equator cp 1 c s 1 c c s 1 c using the topologies and smooth structures on c c s 1 z c z 1 from remark 4 2 remark 5 4 i recall from 5 1 that we denote by bgw a a gromov witten polyfold of curves in class cp 1 a h 2 cp 1 m with 2 marked points these are determined by a h 2 m as we model graphs of maps cp 1 m but should not be confused with a polyfold of curves in m in particular bgw a never contains constant maps and hence is well defined for a 0 the properties of the gromov witten moduli spaces for a 0 are spelled out abstractly in assumption 5 5 ii below for the geometric meaning see remark 5 1 ii the sft polyfolds bsft a will similarly describe curves in class cp 1 a in a neck stretching family of targets cp 1 r m r 0 as in behwz 3 4 given by cp 1 r d er d r with er r r s 1 r 0 s 1 0 s 1 r here we identify the boundaries of the closed unit disks d z c z 1 with the boundary components of the necks er via d e i r r e i r 0 e i r er where we denote 0 0 0 and 0 0 0 so that e 0 s 1 0 s 1 to describe convergence and evaluation maps we also embed each cp 1 r cp 1 c s 1 c by d r 0 s 1 r d 0 s 1 c d 0 r s 1 r d 0 s 1 c er 0 s 1 s 1 cp 1 for r 0 this is to be understood as cp 10 d d d d with d r d c and for all r we view the resulting homeomorphism cp 1 r cp 1 cp 1 as identifying the standard marked points cp 1 z 0 1 0 0 c and cp 1 z 0 0 1 0 c when these embeddings are done via linear shifts r 1 0 r 1 and 1 r 1 r 0 extended by a smooth family of diffeomorphisms 1 0 r 1 and 0 1 1 r then the pullback of the almost complex structures j rh on cp 1 r m converges for r in c loc cp 1 rs 1 m to the almost complex structures j h j h on c m c m cp 1 m cp 1 m which are used in the construction of the pss and ssp moduli spaces in 4 2 moreover this allows us to extend the evaluation maps from 27 to continuous maps ev msft a cp 1 m on the compactified sft moduli space at r this involves pseudoholomorphic buildings in c m r s 1 m r s 1 m c m and for any marked point with evaluation into a cylinder r s 1 m we project the result to s 1 m cp 1 m by forgetting the r component finally this formulation with cp 1 c s 1 c will allow us to compare the evaluation at r with the product of the evaluations ev m sft a c m constructed in remark 4 2 while this will be stated rigorously only in assumption 6 3 iii c note here that we should expect 20 benjamin filippenko katrin wehrheim three top boundary strata of an ambient polyfold at r corresponding to the distribution of marked points on the curves in c m c m for the fiber product construction only the boundary components with one marked point in each factor are relevant in fact only those with marked points near z 0 0 c and z 0 0 c thus we will work with the open subset ev 1 c m ev 1 c m where the two evaluations for any r 0 are constrained to take values in the open sets given by c cp 1 assumption 5 5 there is a collection of oriented sc fredholm sections of strong polyfold bundles gw bgw a egw a and sft bsft a esft a indexed by a h 2 m sc maps ev bgw a cp 1 m and continuous maps ev bsft a cp 1 m with the properties i the sections have fredholm indices ind gw 2 c 1 a dimm 4 on bgw a resp ind sft 2 c 1 a dimm 5 on bsft a ii each zero set mgw a 1 gw 0 and msft a 1 sft 0 is compact and given any c r there are only finitely many a h 2 m with nonempty zero set mgw a 6 resp msft a 6 moreover for a 0 we have mgw a except for a 0 h 2 m when gw bgw 0 0 is in general position with zero set mgw 0 cp 1 cp 1 m identified by bgw 0 1 gw 0 mgw 0 ev ev z x z x z z cp 1 x m iii the polyfolds bgw a have no boundary bgw a for bsft a there is a natural inclusion 0 bgw a bsft a that covers the interior 0 bsft a 0 bgw a and identifies the boundary bsft a to consist of the disjoint sets 0 bgw a and limr r bgw a of bsft a moreover this inclusion identifies the section gw and evaluation maps ev with the restricted section sft 0 bgw a and evaluations ev 0 bgw a a description of the relevant r parts of the boundary bsft a is given in assumption 6 3 iv the sections gw and sft have tame sc fredholm representatives in the sense of fi def 5 4 the product of evaluation maps ev ev bgw a cp 1 m cp 1 m is gw compatibly submersive in the sense of definition a 4 on the open subset b sft a ev 1 c m ev 1 c m bsft a the evaluation maps ev bsft a cp 1 m restrict to a sft compatibly submersive map 29 ev ev b sft a c m c m on this domain intersected with 0 bgw a 1 bsft a this map coincides with the gromov witten evaluations ev ev viewed as maps ev ev b gw a c m c m where we identify c c cp 1 rs 1 and restrict to the domain 0 b gw a 0 bgw a b sft a 0 ev 1 c m ev 1 c m remark 5 6 i while not needed for our proof we state the following properties for intuition the aut cp 1 z 0 z 0 orbits of smooth maps v cp 1 cp 1 m which represent the class cp 1 a form a dense subset bdense a bgw a on this subset the section is given by gw v v j v moreover 0 bdense a bsft a is a dense subset that intersects the boundary bsft a exactly in 0 bdense a and on which the section is given by sft r v v j r h v on these dense subsets ev v resp ev r v is the evaluation as in 27 the intersection of the zero sets with the dense subsets 1 gw 0 bdense a mgw a and 1 sft 0 0 bdense a msft a are naturally identified with the gromov witten moduli space 21 and sft moduli space in 26 ii the polyfold description gw bgw a egw a is developed for the homology classes cp 1 a h 2 cp 1 m in hwz 1 with the submersion property shown in fi ex 5 1 the properties for a 0 in assumption 5 5 ii follow from the fact that nonconstant pseudo holomorphic curves have positive symplectic area and linear cauchy riemann operators on trivial bundles arising from linearization at constant maps are surjective the construction of sft a polyfold proof of the arnold conjecture 21 starts by recognizing that the family of almost complex manifolds in remark 5 4 ii for r is equivalent to a degeneration of the almost complex structure on cp 1 m along the equator s 1 cp 1 this can be described by an r dependent bundle and section over 0 bgw a the construction for r then proceeds analogous to fh 1 3 with buildings consisting of a top and bottom floor curve in c m and intermediate floors given by curves in r s 1 m thus assumption 5 5 iii and the compatibility with bgw a in iv hold by construction the polyfold and bundle structure are again obtained as in fh 1 by extending the constructions in hwz 1 with local models for punctures and neck stretching from fh 3 3 using the implanting method in fh 2 3 5 the remaining properties are proven as outlined in remark 4 4 ii given any such polyfold descriptions of the moduli spaces of pseudoholomorphic curves we now extend the fiber product descriptions of the moduli spaces m p p a m p m z 0 ev ev mgw sft a ev z 0 ev m m p in 5 1 and 5 2 to obtain ambient polyfolds which contain compactifications of the moduli spaces towards this we define for each p p crit f and a h 2 m the topological spaces b p p a v m p m bgw a m m p z 0 ev ev v v m p m b gw a m m p 0 ev ev v b p p a w m p m bsft a m m p z 0 ev ev w w m p m b sft a m m p 0 ev ev w where the last equality stems from the identification at the end of remark 5 4 ii then the abstract fiber product constructions in fi will be used as in lemma 4 5 to obtain the following polyfold description for compactifications of the moduli spaces in 5 1 and 5 2 lemma 5 7 given any p p crit f and a h 2 m there exist open subsets b p p a b p p a 1 and b p p a b p p a 1 which contain the smooth levels b p p a of the fiber products and inherit natural polyfold structures with smooth level of the interior 0 b p

bgw sft a egw sft a under the projection b p p a bgw sft a induces sc fredholm sections of strong polyfold bun dles p p a b p p a e p p a of index i p p a as in 24 and p p a b p p a e p p a of index i p p a i p p a 1 as in 18 further these are related via the inclusion by natural orientation preserving identification p p a p p a the zero sets of these sc fredholm sections contain 8 the moduli

crit f and c r there are only finitely many a h 2 m with a c and nonempty zero set p p a 1 0 6 proof the inclusion is sc since the map bgw a bsft a v 7 0 v is a sc inclusion by assumption 5 5 iii apart from further relations involving the proof is directly analogous to the fiber product construction in lemma 4 5 using assumption 5 5 in particular the sc and sft compatibly submersive evaluation map 29 on the open subset b sft a bsft a this yields polyfold structures on open sets b p p a b p p a 1 and b p p a 8 as in remark 4 4 this identification is stated for intuition and will ultimately not be used in our proofs 22 benjamin filippenko katrin wehrheim notation description definition bdense a elements are equivalence classes under reparameterization by aut cp 1 z 0 z 0 of smooth maps

pullback sc fredholm sections p p a pr sft sft and p p a pr gw gw under the projections prgw sft b p p a bgw sft a here we have prgw prsft so the bundle e p p a pr gwegw a and section p p a pr gw gw are naturally identified with the pullback bundle e p p a pr gwesft a 0 bgw a and section p p a pr gw sft 0 bgw a using assumption 5 5 iii finally the index of the induced section p p a and similarly

the moduli spaces m 1 0 and m 1 0 for all tuples in the indexing set i p p a p p crit f a h 2 m we can again apply hwz theorems 18 2 18 3 18 8 to the sc fredholm sections and and obtain corollary 4 6 verbatim for these collections of moduli spaces in 6 we will moreover make use of the fact that arises from restriction of so admissible perturbations of pull back to admissible perturbations of for now we choose perturbations independently and thus as in definition 4 8 obtain perturbation dependent and not yet algebraically related linear maps definition 5 8 given admissible sc multisections p p a p crit f a h 2 in general po sition to p p a and p p a p crit f a h 2 in general position to p p a as in corollary 4 6 we define the maps h cm cm and cm cm to be the linear extensions of h p p a i p p a 0 z p p a t a p p p a i p p a 0 z p p a t a p the proof that the coefficients of these maps lie in the novikov field is verbatim the same as lemma 4 9 based on the compactness properties in lemma 5 7 a polyfold proof of the arnold conjecture 23 remark 5 9 the determination in corollary 4 6 of z p p a z p p a q that is used in definition 5 8 requires an orientation of the sections p p a and p p a as in remark 4 7 this is determined via the fiber product construction in lemma 5 7 from the orienta tions of the morse trajectory spaces in remark 3 5 i and the orientations of gw sft given in assumption 5 5 in practice we will construct the perturbations by pullback of perturbations a a h 2 m of the sft sections sft and their restriction to 0 bgw a bsft a so we can specify the orientations of the regularized zero sets by expressing them as transverse fiber products of oriented spaces over cp 1 m or c m z p p a m p m ev 0 ev z a ev ev 0 m m p m p m ev 0 ev z a b gw a ev ev 0 m m p z p p

perturbations in this section we prove parts i iii of theorem 1 3 that is the algebraic properties which relate the maps pss cm cf ssp cf cm constructed in 4 and the maps cm cm h cm cm constructed in 5 more precisely we will make so called coherent choices of perturbations in 6 2 6 3 and 6 4 which guarantee that i is a chain map ii is a module isomorphism and iii h is a chain homotopy between the composition ssp pss and 6 1 coherent polyfold descriptions of moduli spaces the general approach to obtaining not just counts as discussed in 4 2 but well defined algebraic structures from moduli spaces of pseudoholomorphic curves is to replace them by compact manifolds with boundary and corners or generalizations thereof which still carry relative virtual fundamental classes in such a manner that their boundary strata are given by cartesian products of each other in the context of polyfold theory this requires a description of the compactified moduli spaces m 1 0 as zero sets of a coherent collection of sc fredholm sections b e i of strong polyfold bundles here coherence indicates a well organized identification of the boundaries b with unions of cartesian products of other polyfolds in the collection i which is compatible with the bundles and sections as a first example the moduli spaces m p p a in 5 1 which yield the map cm cm are given polyfold descriptions p p a b p p a e p p a in lemma 5 7 that arise as fiber products with polyfolds bgw a without boundary thus their coherence properties stated below follow from properties of the fiber product in fi and the boundary stratification of the morse trajectory spaces in theorem 3 3 we state this result to illustrate the notion of coherence the full technical statement on the level of ep groupoids and including compatibility with bundles and sections can be found in the second bullet point of lemma 6 4 lemma 6 1 for any p crit f and a h 2 m the smooth level of the first boundary stratum of the fiber product b p p a in lemma 5 7 is naturally identified with 1 b p p a q crit f m p q 0 b q p a q crit f 0 b p q a m q p proof by the fiber product construction fi cor 7 3 of b p p a in lemma 5 7 the degeneracy index satisfies db p p a v dm p m dbgw a v dm m p and the smooth level is b p p a m p m z 0 ev ev b gw a ev z 0 ev m m p the poly fold bgw a and its open subset b gw a are boundaryless by assumption 5 5 iii which means dbgw a db gw a 0 hence we have db p p a v 1 if and only if 1 m p m and 0 m m p or the other way around these two cases are disjoint but analogous so it re mains to show that the first case consists of points in the union q crit f m p q 0 b q p a 24 benjamin filippenko katrin wehrheim for that purpose recall the identification 1 m p m q crit f m p q m q m in theo rem 3 3 which is compatible with the evaluation ev m p q m q m m 1 2 7 ev 2 by construction and thus 1 m p m z 0 ev ev b gw a ev z 0 ev 0 m m p q crit f m p q m q m z 0 ev ev b gw a ev z 0 ev m m p q crit f m p q m

spaces m p p a in 5 2 which yield the map h cm cm are obtained as fiber products of the morse trajectory spaces with polyfold descriptions sft bsft a esft a of sft moduli spaces given in fh 4 we will state as assumption only those parts of their coherence properties that are relevant to our argument in 6 4 for the chain homotopy ssp pss d h h d here the contributions to d h h d will arise from boundary strata of the morse trajectory spaces whereas ssp pss arises from the following identification of the boundary of the polyfold b sft a which is given as open subset of bsft a in assumption 5 5 iv 9 remark 6 2 in the following we will use the word face loosely for cartesian products of polyfolds such as f b sft a b sft a and their immersions into the boundary of another polyfold such as b sft a we also refer to the image of the immersion f b sft a as a face of b sft a compared with the formal definition of faces in hwz definitions 2 21 11 1 16 13 ours are disjoint unions of faces they describe the interaction between the moduli spaces roughly speaking i the r boundary parts of bsft a in which the marked points separate are covered by immersions of products of the pss and ssp polyfolds this structure arises from generalizing the sft compactification in behwz to buildings of not necessarily holomorphic maps the parts of the boundary described here are given by buildings whose top and bottom floors are given by maps to c m and intermediate floors given by maps to r s 1 m the immersions then arise from stacking a building in b sft a with top floor in c m on top of a building in b sft a with bottom floor in c m here a lack of injectivity arises at buildings with middle floors in r s 1 m from ambiguity in splitting such building into two parts ii the immersions restrict to a disjoint cover of the top boundary stratum of b sft a by embed dings this restriction is given by the buildings with a single floor guaranteeing injectivity by avoiding the ambiguous middle floors in r s 1 m iii the immersions are compatible simply by construction with the evaluation maps bundles and sections for the boundary components at r and the boundary bgw a at r 0 assumption 6 3 the collection of oriented sc fredholm sections of strong polyfold bundles sft b sft a e sft a gw bgw a egw a sft bsft a esft a for p h and a h 2 m together with the evaluation maps ev

which have one marked point in each of the components mapping to c m and no marked points mapping to intermediate cylinders r s 1 m a polyfold proof of the arnold conjecture 25 set limr r bgw a from

lated by pullback to sft sft sft l a via a natural identification l a esft a e sft a e sft a this identification preserves the orientation of sections 6 2 coherent perturbations for chain map identity in this section we prove theorem 1 3 i that is we construct in definition 5 8 as a chain map on the morse complex 5 with differential d cm cm given by 4 this requires the following construction of the perturbations that is coherent in the sense that it is compatible with the boundary identifications of the polyfolds b p p a in lemma 6 1 here we will indicate smooth levels by adding as superscript denoting e g x p p a as the smooth level of an ep groupoid representing b p p a lemma 6 4 there is a choice of i in corollary 4 6 for i p p a p crit f a h 2 m that is coherent w r t the identifications in lemma 6 1 in the following sense each w q for i is an admissible sc multisection of a strong bundle p w x that is in general position to a sc fredholm section functor s x w which represents v on an open neighbourhood v b of the zero set 1 0 the identification of top boundary strata in lemma 6 1 holds for the representing ep groupoids 1 x p p a q crit f m p q 0 x q p a q crit f 0 x p q a m q p and the oriented section functors s x w are compatible with these identifications in the sense that the restriction of s p p a to any face f p q m p q 0 x 1 x p p a resp f q p 0 x m q p 1 x p p a for another i coincides on the smooth level with the pullback s f pr fs f of s via the projection prf f f p q m p q 0 x x resp prf f f q p 0 x m q p x 10 the extra boundary faces of bsft a arise from both marked points mapping to the same component in the r neck stretching limit these will not be relevant to our construction of coherent perturbations 26 benjamin filippenko katrin wehrheim each restriction p 1 f to a face f f p q resp f f q p is given by pullback p 1 f pr f via the identification p 1 f pr fw 0 x and natural map pr f pr fw w for any such choice of i the resulting map cm cm in definition 5 8 satisfies d d 0 by setting p 1 p p we then obtain a chain map c m c m that is d d proof we will first assume the claimed coherence and discuss the algebraic consequences up to signs then construct the coherent data and finally use this construction to compute the orientations construction of chain map assuming d d 0 recall that d decreases the degree on the morse complex 6 by 1 thus c m c m defined as above satisfies for any q crit f d d q 1 q 1 d q d 1 q q 1 q 1 d d q 0 by linearity this proves d d on c m proof of identity to prove d d 0 note that both and d are linear so the claimed identity is equivalent to the collection of identities d p d p 0 for all generators p crit f that is we wish to verify q p a i q p a 0 q p 1 m p q z q p a t a p q p a i p q a 0 p q 1 z p q a m q p t a p 0 here by the index formula 18 both sides can be written as sums over p crit f and a h 2 m for which i p p a 1 then it suffices to prove for any such pair p p a with i 1 30 q p 1 m p q z q p a q p 1 z p q a m q p 0 this identity will follow by applying corollary 4 6 v to the sc multisection w q its perturbed zero set is a weighted branched 1 dimensional orbifold z whose boundary is given by the intersection with the smooth level 11 of the top boundary stratum 1 b v 1 x by coherence and with orientations discussed below this boundary is z z 1 x q crit f z m p q 0 x q p a q crit f z 0 x p q a m q p q crit f m p q z q p a 0 x q p a q crit f z p q a 0 x p q a m q p q p 1 m p q z q p a q p 1 z p q a m q p here the first summand of the third identification on the level of object spaces x m p q 0 xq p a 1 x s x 0 x m p q 0 xq p a q p a s q p a x 0 m p q x 0 xq p a q p a s q p a x 0 follows if we assume coherence of sections and multisections on the faces f p q 1 x s x s q p a x q p a s q p a x the second summand is identified similarly by assuming coherence on the faces f q p 1 x finally the fourth identification in z for p p a with i 1 follows from index and regularity considerations as follows corollary 4 6 iii iv guarantees that the perturbed solution spaces z are nonempty only for fredholm index i 0 and for i 0 are contained in the interior z 0 b the morse trajectory spaces m p q resp m q p 11 here and in the following we suppress indications of the smooth level as the perturbed zero sets automatically lie in the smooth level see remark a 3 a polyfold proof of the arnold conjecture 27 are nonempty only for p q 1 resp q p 1 so the perturbed solution spaces in the cartesian products have fredholm index 18 i q p a 2 c 1 a q p i p p a q p 1 q p 0 and analogously i p q a i p p a p q 0 by the above regularity of the perturbed solution spaces this implies that the unions on the left hand side of the fourth identification are over q p 1 resp q p 1 as in 30 and for these critical points we have the inclusions z q p a 0 b q p a and z p q a 0 b p q a that verify the equality this finishes the identification of the boundary z now corollary 4 6 v asserts that the sum of weights over this boundary is zero when counted with signs that are induced by the orientation of z so in order to prove the identity 30 we need to compare the boundary orientation of z with the orientations on the faces we will compute the relevant signs in 31 below after first making coherent choices of representatives s x w of the oriented sections and constructing coherent sc multisections w q for i coherent ep groupoids sections and perturbations recall that the fiber product construc tion in lemma 5 7 defines each bundle w pr w gw a for p p a i as the pullback of a strong bundle wgwa x gw a under a projection of ep groupoids with abbreviated notation ev 0 z 0 ev m cp 1 m prp p a x p p a m p m ev 0 ev x gw a ev ev 0 m m p x gw a moreover the section s s gw a pr is induced by the section s gw a x gw a w gw a which cuts out the gromov witten moduli space mgw a s gw a 1 0 then the identification of the top boundary stratum proceeds exactly as the proof of lemma 6 1 coherence of the bundles and sections follows from coherence of the projections pr x x gw a in the sense that pr f pr prf for all smooth levels of faces f f 1 x and their projections prf f f p q x resp prf f f q p x for example the face f f p q q p a with f 1 x p p a identifies v f p q q p a m p q 0 x q p a m p q m q m ev 0 ev x gw a ev ev 0 m m p with v m p m 1 ev 0 ev x gw a ev ev 0 m m p 1 x p p a and prp p a v v xgwa coincides with prq p a prf v prq p a v v x gw a now any choice of sc multisections gwa w gw a q a h 2 m induces a coherent collection of sc multisections gw a pr pr w gw a q i by composition with the natural maps pr pr w gw a w gw a covering pr x x gw a indeed pr f pr prf lifts to pr p 1 f pr pr f so that p 1 f gw a pr p 1 f gw a pr pr f pr f construction of admissible gromov witten perturbations it remains to choose the sc multisections gwa w gw a q a h 2 m so that the induced coherent collection gwa pr i is admissible and in general position to do so for each a h 2 m we apply theorem a 9 to the sc fredholm section functor sgwa x gw a w gw a the sc submersion ev ev xgwa cp 1 m cp 1 m and the collection of cartesian products of stable and unstable manifolds z 0 w p z 0 w p for all pairs of critical points p p crit f after fixing a pair controlling compactness na ua for each a h 2 m theorem a 9 yields na ua admissible sc multisections gwa w gw a q in general position to sgwa for each a h 2 m moreover they can be chosen such that restriction of evaluations to the perturbed zero set ev ev z gw a cp 1 m cp 1 m is transverse to all of the products of unstable and stable submanifolds z 0 w p z 0 w p for p p crit f note that these embedded submanifolds cover the images of all evaluation maps on the compactified morse trajectory spaces ev 0 ev 0 m p m m m p cp 1 m cp 1 m by construction of the evaluations ev m m in 8 which determine ev 0 z 0 ev thus we obtain transverse fiber 28 benjamin filippenko katrin wehrheim products m p m ev 0 ev z gwa ev ev 0 m m p for every i this translates into the pullbacks gw a pr being in general position to the pullback sections s for i moreover is admissible with respect to a pullback of na ua so the perturbed zero set is a compact weighted branched orbifold for each p p a s 1 0 z m p m ev 0 ev z gwa ev ev 0 m m p this finishes the construction of coherent perturbations computation of orientations to prove the identity 30 it remains to compute the effect of the orientations in remark 5 9 on the algebraic identity in corollary 4 6 v that arises from the boundary z of the 1 dimensional weighted branched orbifolds arising from regularization of the moduli spaces with index i i p p a 1 here z gwa is of even dimension and has no boundary since the gromov witten polyfolds in assumption 5 5 have no boundary and the index of gw is even for the morse trajectory spaces the boundary strata are determined in theorem 3 3 with relevant orientations computed in remark 3 5 thus for i p p 2 c 1 a 1 we can compute orientations at the level of well defined finite dimensional tangent spaces at a solution in whose neighbourhood the evaluation maps are guaranteed to be scale smooth z 1 m p m ev ev z gwa ev ev 0 m m p 1 dimm p m 0 m p m ev ev z gwa ev ev 1 m m p q critf m p q m q m ev ev z gwa ev ev m m p 31 1 p p 1 m p m ev ev z

used remark 3 5 and in the final equality we use p p 1 i 1 0 modulo 2 this finishes the computation of the oriented boundaries z for i 1 that proves 30 and thus yields a chain map 6 3 admissible perturbations for isomorphism property in this section we prove theo rem 1 3 ii i e construct 1 c m c m in definition 5 8 and lemma 6 4 as a module isomorphism on the chain complex cm cm over the novikov field as in 5 this requires a construction of the perturbations that preserves the properties of the zero sets in remark 5 1 for nonpositive symplectic area a 0 lemma 6 5 the coherent collection of sc multisections in lemma 6 4 can be chosen such that z p p a 0 for a h 2 m r 0 with a 0 or for a 0 and p 6 p and z p p 0 6 0 as a consequence 1 cm cm is a module isomorphism proof the sc multisections in lemma 6 4 are obtained from choices of sc multisections a w a q a h 2 m that are in general position to sc fredholm sections sa x gw a wa which cut out the gromov witten moduli space mgw a s 1 a 0 and such that moreover the evaluation maps restricted to the perturbed zero sets ev ev z a cp 1 m cp 1 m are transverse to the unstable and stable manifolds z 0 w p z 0 w p cp 1 m cp 1 m for any pair of critical points p p crit f we will first consider p p a i for nontrivial homology classes a h 2 m r 0 with nonpositive symplectic area a 0 recall from remark 5 1 that these moduli spaces are empty s 1 a 0 so as in corollary 4 6 we can choose empty neighbourhoods ua x gw a to control compactness then the perturbed zero set z a x xa a sa x 0 ua is forced to be empty i e a sa 0 this is an allowed choice in lemma 6 4 since evaluation maps from an empty set are trivially transverse to any submanifold this choice induces for any p crit f in p p a an induced sc multisection a pr w q its perturbed zero set is z x x s x 0 a polyfold proof of the arnold conjecture 29 since the coherence in lemma 6 4 implies s a pr s a sa pr 0 or more concretely p p a s p p a x a sa x 0 thus we have ensured vanishing counts z p p a 0 for a h 2 m r 0 with a 0 whenever i p p a 0 next we consider a 0 h 2 m and recall from remark 5 1 and assumption 5 5 ii that the gromov witten moduli space mgw 0 z 0 is already compact and transversely cut out thus the trivial sc multisection 0 w 0 q given by 0 0 x 1 on zero vectors 0 x w 0 x and 0 w 0 xr 0 x 0 is an admissible sc multisection in general position to s 0 x gw 0 w 0 recall moreover that the evaluation maps on the unperturbed zero set are ev ev z 0 cp 1 cp 1 m cp 1 m cp 1 m z z x 7 z x z x in the cp 1 factors this is submersive so transverse to the fixed points z 0 z 0 cp 1 cp 1 in the m factors this is the diagonal map which is transverse to the unstable and stable manifolds w p w p m m for any pair p p crit f by the morse smale condition on the metric on m chosen in 3 thus the trivial multisection 0 is in fact an allowed choice in lemma 6 4 now with this choice the tuples p p 0 i for which we need to compute z p p 0 v m p m z 0 m m p z 0 ev ev v m p m m m p ev ev are those with 0 i p p 0 2 c 1 0 p p i e p p these are the fiber products identified in remark 3 5 ii as either empty or a one point set m p m ev evm m p p 6 p p p p p thus we have counts z p p 0 0 for p 6 p and z p p 0 6 0 for each p crit f finally we will use these computations of z p p a for a 0 to prove that the resulting map 1 cm cm is a module isomorphism for that purpose we choose an arbitrary total order of the critical points crit f p 1 p and for i j 1 denote the coefficients of pj i 1 ij pi by ij we claim that the matrix with entries ij r ij r t r satisfies the conditions of lemma 2 1 to check this recall that we have by construction in definition 5 8 and change of signs in lemma 6 4 ijr a h 2 m a r i pj pi a 0 1 pj z pj pi a for r 0 we obtain ijr 0 since each coefficient z pj pi a 0 vanishes for a r 0 for r 0 and i 6 j we also have ij 0 0 since z pj pi a 0 also holds for a 0 and pj 6 pi finally for r 0 and i j we use z pj pi a 0 for a 6 0 with a 0 to compute ii 0 z pj pi 0 6 0 this confirms that lemma 2 1 applies and thus ij 1 i j is invertible this finishes the proof 6 4 coherent perturbations for chain homotopy in this section we prove theorem 1 3 iii by constructing h cm cm in definition 5 8 as a chain homotopy between ssp pss and from definitions 4 8 5 8 with appropriate sign adjustments as in lemma 6 4 this requires a coherent construction of perturbations over the indexing sets i i p p a p p crit f a h 2 m i p a p crit f p h a h 2 m i p a p crit f p h a h 2 m here we will use notation from lemma a 7 for cartesian products of multisections lemma 6 6 there is a choice of i i i i in definitions 4 8 5 8 that is coherent in the following sense i each w q for i i i i is an admissible sc multisection of a strong bundle p w x that is in general position to a sc fredholm section functor s x w 30 benjamin filippenko katrin wehrheim which represents v on an open neighbourhood v b of the zero set 1 0 the tuple i satisfies the conclusions of lemma 6 4 and 6 5 ii the smooth level of the first boundary stratum of xp p a for every p p a i is naturally identified on the level of object spaces and compatible with morphisms with 1 x p p a 0 x p p a p h a a a 0 x p a 0 x p a q crit f m p q 0 x q p a q crit f 0 x p q a m q p 32 and the oriented section functors s are compatible with these identifications in the sense that the restriction of sp p a to any of these faces f 1 x p p a is given by pullback sp p a f pr fsf of another sc fredholm section of a strong bundle over an ep groupoid sf xf wf given by sq p a sp q a s p p a resp sf s p a s p a x p a x p a w p a w p a via the projection prf f xf given by the natural maps m p q 0 xq p a xq p a 0 x p p a x p p a 0 xp q a m q p xp q a 0 x p a 0 x p a x p a x p a iii each restriction p 1 f for p p a i to one of the faces f 1 x is given via the identification p 1 f pr fwf 0 xf and natural map pr f pr fwf wf by p 1 f q p a pr f for f m p q 0 xq p a p q a pr f for f 0 xp q a m q p p p a pr f for f 0 x p p a p a p a pr f for f 0 x p a 0 x p a for any such choice of i the resulting maps pss ssp h in definitions 4 8 5 8 satisfy 1 p p 1 p ssp pss p h d p d h p where d is the morse differential from 3 by setting p 1 p p as in lemma 6 4 pss p 1 p pss p ssp ssp and h h we then obtain a chain homotopy between and ssp pss that is ssp pss d h h d proof this proof is similar to lemma 6 4 with more complicated combinatorics of the boundary faces due to the boundary of bsft described in assumption 6 3 and presented in different order we will first make the coherent constructions and then deduce the algebraic consequences coherent ep groupoids and sections to construct coherent representatives s x w for i i i i as claimed in ii recall that the fiber product construction in lemma 5 7 defines each bundle w pr w sft a for p p a i as the pullback of a strong bundle pa w sft a x sft a under the natural projection of ep groupoids prp p a xp p a m p m ev 0 ev x sft a ev ev 0 m m p x sft a here ev 0 m c m 7 0 ev arise from morse evaluation 8 the ep groupoid x sfta x sft a is a full subcategory determined by the open subset b sft a ev 1 c m ev 1 c m bsft a of an ep groupoid x sft a from assumption 5 5 that represents bsft a and thus contains the compactified sft neck stretching moduli space msft a s sft a 1 0 as zero set of a sc fredholm section ssfta x sft a w sft a we will work with both groupoids multisection perturbations are constructed over x sfta since we need a compact zero set to specify the admissibility that guarantees preservation of compactness under perturbations both for ssfta and its fiber product restrictions s on the other hand x sft a bsft a has more complicated boundary than b sft a due to the distribution of marked points into building levels and does not support a sc evaluation map thus we discuss coherence only over subgroupoids x sfta x sft a with a polyfold proof of the arnold conjecture 31 the boundary stratification of b sft a and which support sc functors ev x sfta c m representing the evaluation maps 29 here we may even use subgroupoids x sfta representing a smaller open subset ev 1 d r m ev 1 d r m bsft a of preimages of the disks d r z c z r c which contain the standard marked points z 0 0 c 12 the polyfold structure on the fiber products x in lemma 5 7 is independent of the choice of open neighbourhood in bsft a of the subset satisfying the fiber product condition after obtaining the subgroupoid x sfta x sft a from such an open subset we obtain the bundle w sft a w sft a x sfta and section ssfta x sfta x sfta w sft a by restriction finally each section s s sft a pr is induced by the above projection pr x x sft a x sft a next restriction to the boundary faces given in assumption 6 3 i induces representatives sgwa x gwa w gw a resp s a x a w a of the sections gw bgw a egw a resp sft b sft a e sft a from assumption 4 3 resp 5 5 moreover the boundary of the open subset ev ev 1 d r m d r m for 0 r with d c yields subgroupoids xgwa x gw a representing ev ev 1 d r m d r m bgw a resp x a x a representing ev 1 d r m b sft a along with restricted sections s gw a x gw a w gw a w gwa xgwa resp s a x a w a w a x a then the evaluation maps restrict to sc functors ev xgwa d r m resp ev x a d r m which yield again independent of r 0 the fiber product construction of b in lemma 4 5 and of b in lemma 5 7 now the identification of the top boundary strata 1 x p p a will proceed similar to the proof of lemma 6 1 with bgw a replaced by b sft a apart from the fact that the sft polyfold has boundary this boundary is identified in assumption 6 3 ii as 33 1 x sft a xgwa p h a a a 0 x a 0 x a by the fiber product construction fi cor 7 3 of b p p a in lemma 5 7 the degeneracy in dex satisfies db p p a u t dm p m dbsft a u dm m p hence we have db p p a u 1 if and only if the degeneracy index of exactly one of the three arguments u is 1 and the other two are 0 this identifies 1 xp p a 1 b p p a as in the first line of the displayed equation below then the subsequent identifications result by comparing the resulting expressions with the interiors in lemma 4 5 5 7 we obtain an identification that through out is to be interpreted on the smooth level as fiber product constructions drop some non smooth points 1 xp p a 0 m p m ev 0 ev

also used the identification of evaluation maps in assumption 6 3 iii a then compatibility in ii of the oriented section functors s with the identification of these smooth levels of faces f 1 x p p a follows from compatibility of prp p a xp p a x sft a with the projections pr x x a for i used in lemma 4 5 and pr x x gw a used in lemma 5 7 more 12 these disks should not be confused with the closed disks d in the construction of cp 1 r as e g d c d r 0 s 1 r is a precompact subset of the first hemisphere in cp 1 r c s 1 c for any r 0 32 benjamin filippenko katrin wehrheim precisely sp p a f pr

also coherent as claimed in iii the existence of such coherent transverse perturbations will ultimately be guaranteed by an abstract perturbation theorem for coherent systems of sc fredholm sections since the sft perturbation package fh 1 14 has not yet been described for neck stretching we give a detailed construction of the perturbations for our purposes we proceed as in lemma 6 4 and construct them all as pullbacks a pr of a collection of sc multisections on the sft resp gromov witten polyfold bundles without morse trajectories a w a q p h a h 2 m gwa w gw a q a h 2 m a w a q p h a h 2 m sfta w sft a q a h 2 m for this to induce a coherent collection of sc multisections as required in iii p a a pr p a p a i p p a gw a pr p p a p p a i p a a pr p a p a i p p a sft a prp p a p p a i it suffices to pick compatible with respect to the faces of the sft neck stretching polyfolds x sfta in 33 more precisely using the natural identifications of bundles from assumption 6 3 iii we will construct coherent in the sense that for some choice of r 0 in the construction of x a ev 1 d r m b sft a and w a w a x a we have sfta w gw a w w w gw a 34 sfta l a w w a w a w w w w a w a 35 where l a is the map defined in assumption 6 3 i so to finish this proof it remains to choose the sc multisections so that each induced sc multisection in the induced coherent collection for i i i i is admissible and in general position while also satisfying the coherence requirements 34 35 and the requirements on in the proofs of lemma 6 4 and 6 5 the construction of coherent perturbations for the sft polyfolds analogously to fh 1 14 proceeds by first choosing coherent compactness controlling data i e pairs n u of auxiliary norms on all the bundles and saturated neighbourhoods of the compact zero sets in all the ep groupoids x a x gw a x sft a c f definition a 5 which are compatible with the immersions to boundary faces in 33 then it constructs the perturbations gwa as in lemma 6 5 and also a to be in general position admissible w r t the coherent data 2 n u and coherent in the sense that continuous extension of 34 35 induces a well defined multisection a w sft a x sfta q here coherence of the perturbations on the intersection of faces see remark 6 2 is required to guarantee existence of scale smooth extensions of a to multisections sft a w sft a q coherence of the compactness controlling pairs guarantees that the multisection a over x sft a x sft a satisfies the auxiliary norm bounds n a 1 2 and support requirements that guarantee compactness for extensions sfta of a with n sft a 1 and appropriate support requirements moreover we may choose each of the extensions sfta using theorem a 9 to ensure as in lemma 6 4 that the induced multisections are in general position as well the latter will automatically be admissible with respect to pullback of the pair controlling compactness in more detail but without specifying the auxiliary a polyfold proof of the arnold conjecture 33 norm bounds the inductive construction of perturbations in fh 4 simplified to the subset of sft moduli spaces considered here proceeds as follows construction of gw a and since the gromov witten ep groupoids x gwa are boundaryless by assumption 5 5 iii the sc multisections gwa can be chosen independently of all other multisec tions so we construct gwa as in the proofs of lemma 6 4 and 6 5 to ensure that the conclusions in these lemmas hold as required by i this prescribes 34 on the boundary face x gwa x sft a moreover recall that gwa is obtained by applying theorem a 9 to the sc fredholm section func tors sgwa the sc submersion ev ev x gwa cp 1 m cp 1 m and the collection of cartesian products of stable and unstable manifolds z 0 w p z 0 w p as in the proof of lemma 6 4 this ensures that the pullbacks gw a pr i are in general position moreover these pullbacks are admissible w r t the pairs controlling compactness on w x that result by pullback from the coherent compactness controlling pair on w gwa x gw a which is constructed in a preliminary step as in fh 1 13 coherence for a the next step is to construct sc multisections a w a q over the sft ep groupoids x a of planes with limit orbit p h from assumption 4 3 which then induce the perturbations for the pss ssp moduli spaces these constructions are independent of the choice of gwa since the corresponding boundary faces of x sft a do not intersect by assumption 6 3 ii however to enable the subsequent construction of sfta as extension of the boundary values pre scribed in 34 and 35 we need to make sure that each sc multisection a a l a 1 is well defined on the open subset of face f a l a x a x a x sft a and coincides with the other sc multisections a a l a 1 on their intersection f a f a then this yields a well defined sc multisection on f a x sft a x sft a to describe these intersections we note that fh 1 constructs the ep groupoids x a with coherent boundaries involving ep groupoids x fl b p h b h 2 m which contain the moduli spaces of floer tra jectories between periodic orbits as well as further ep groupoids for floer trajectories carrying a marked point we will avoid dealing with the latter by specifying values r when pulling back perturbations from the ep groupoids x a x a given by x a ev 1 d r m b sft a as this will prevent the appearance of marked floer trajectories even in the closure for any fixed value 0 r the j th boundary stratum is given by j floer trajectories breaking off jx a 0 j p h a b 1 bj a 0 x 0 a 0 x fl 0 1 b 1 0 x fl j 1 j bj 36 k jx a j k p h bj 1 bk a a 0 x fl j j 1 bj 1 0 x fl k 1 k bk 0 x k a now for example 0 x 0 a 0 x fl 0 1 b 0 x 1 a is both a subset of 0 x 0 a 1 x 0 a b x 0 a x 0 a b and of 1 x 1 a b 0 x 1 a x 1 a b x 1 a and the embeddings l 0 a 0 and 1 a 1 for the two splittings a a b a 0 a 0 a a 1 a 1 a b a coincide under this identification generally the boundary of the floer ep groupoids is given by broken trajectories and this yields a disjoint cover of r x sfta x sft a r x sfta 0 k p h a b 1 bk a a l a b 0 x 0 a 0 x fl 0 1 b 1 0 x fl k 1 k bk 0 x k a in which the embeddings l a b coincide with each of the embeddings l j aj for 0 j k and a j a i j bi a j a i j bi when restricted to the subsets 0 x 0 a 0 x fl 0 1 b 1 0 x fl k 1 k bk 0 x k a jx j a j k jx j a j now on these subsets we require coherence j a j j a j j a j j a j for all 0 j 6 j k as this is equivalent to 35 being well defined on im l a b k j 0 f j aj this will be achieved 34 benjamin filippenko katrin wehrheim by constructing the sc multisections a to have product structure on the boundary where the bundles p a w a x a are restricted to various faces of x a j a j p 1 j a j x 0 a xfl 0 1 b 1 xfl j 1 j bj 0 a fl 0 1 b 1 fl j

coherence on each overlap of embeddings im l a b f j aj f j a j j a j j a j 0 a fl 0 1 b 1 fl k 1 k bj k a j a j j a j we are now faced with the challenge of satisfying the coherence conditions in 37 these condi tions uniquely determine the boundary restrictions a p 1 a x a via the identification of the boundaries with cartesian products of interiors in 36 thus 36 on cartesian products involving boundary strata poses coherence conditions on the choice of fl for i fl p h p h h 2 m construction of fl b to achieve the coherence in 37 fh 4 first constructs the sc multisections fl ifl by iteration over the maximal degeneracy k max k n 0 s fl 1 0 kx fl 6 of unperturbed solutions which is finite by gromov compactness we first consider classes with k for these the section s fl has no zeros so is already transverse so that fl can be chosen as the trivial perturbation the trivial multivalued section functor w q is given by 0 1 and w 6 0 0 next we consider with k 0 for these the section s fl has all zeros in the interior so that fl can be chosen admissible and trivial on the boundary by applying corollary 4 6 i with a neighbourhood of the unperturbed zero set in the interior sfl 1 0 v 0 x fl once the iteration has constructed fl for all with k n for some n n 0 we proceed to consider b ifl with k n 1 for these the restriction fl p 1 xfl to the boundary x fl 0 1 k 1 k b b 1 bk 0 x fl 0 1 b 1 0 x fl k 1 k bk is prescribed by the previous iteration steps fl p 1 xfl 0 1 b 1 xfl k 1 k bk fl 0 1 b 1 fl k 1 k bk on all boundary faces that contain unperturbed solutions in their closure indeed existence of a solution in x fl 0 1 b 1 x fl k 1 k bk implies k i 1 i bi 0 for i 1 k and the cartesian product of solutions of maximal degeneracy yields 1 k 0 1 b 1 k k 1 k bk k thus these prescriptions are made for 0 k i 1 i bi k 1 n and on boundary faces with no solutions in their closure we prescribe the trivial perturbation throughout this yields a well defined sc multisection fl p 1 xfl by coherence in the prior iteration steps so that fl can be constructed by applying the extension result hwz thm 15 5 which provides general position and admissibility with respect to a pair controlling compactness that extends the pair which was chosen on the boundary in prior iteration steps construction of a and with the floer perturbations in place fh 4 next constructs the collections of sc multisections a p h a h 2 m to satisfy 37 by iteration over degeneracy k a max k n 0 s a 1 0 kx a 6 for k a one takes a to be trivial for k a 0 one applies theorem a 9 to the sc fredholm section functor s a x a w a the map ev x a c m and the collection of stable resp unstable manifolds 0 w p for all critical points p crit f these satisfy the assumptions as the zero set s a 1 0 is compact and the preimages ev 1 0 w p lie within the open subset x a x a on which ev restricts to a sc submersion ev x a c m we can moreover prescribe a p 1 a x a to be trivial since in the absence of solutions the trivial perturbation is in general position then theorem a 9 provides a that is supported in the interior and transverse to each submanifold 0 w p in the sense that these submanifolds are transverse to the evaluation from the perturbed zero set 38 ev x x a a s a x 0 c m a polyfold proof of the arnold conjecture 35 now suppose that admissible a in general position have been constructed for k a k n 0 and satisfy both the transversality in 38 and the coherence condition 37 over the ep groupoids x a ev 1 d rk m with rk 2 2 k then for k a k 1 we will construct a to sat isfy 37 over ev 1 d rk 1 m by first noting that the previous iteration and requiring triviality on boundary faces without solutions determines a well defined sc multisection a p 1 a x a over the r rk boundary x a a a b 0 x a x fl b for faces w r t x a with solutions it is given by a p 1 a x a xfl b a fl b where k a 1 k a k b this is well defined at x x x 0 x a x fl b x fl b b which appears both as x x x 0 x a x fl b and x x x x a b x fl b b by the coherence of the floer multisections and the prior iteration for vectors in the respective fibers w w w p 1 a x p 1 b x p 1 b b x we have a w fl b w w a w fl b w fl b b w a b w w fl b b w moreover ev x x a a s a x 0 c m is transverse to the submanifolds 0 w p however this defines an admissible sc multisection in general position only over the open subset of the boundary x a ev 1 d rk m x a we multiply the given data by a scale smooth cutoff function guaranteed by the existence of partitions of unity for the open cover x a ev 1 d rk m ev 1 c rd r k 1 2 m see remark a 6 to obtain an admissible sc multisection a w a x a q which coincides with the prescribed data thus in general position and with evaluation transverse to each 0 w p over the closed subset ev 1 d rk 1 m x a then a w a q is constructed with these given boundary values using theorem a 9 to achieve not just general position but also transversality as in 38 by admissibility of the prior iteration and coherence of the pairs controlling compactness a can moreover be chosen admissible as required in the coherence discussion this determines right hand sides of 35 which agree on overlaps of different immersions l a x a x a for r 2 thus it constructs a well defined sc multisection on r x sfta l a x a x a x sft a that is admissible and has evaluations transverse to the submanifolds 0 w p 0 w p for all pairs p p crit f moreover for i we obtain a pair controlling compactness by pullback of the coherent pairs constructed as in fh 1 13 on the bundles w a then the pullback multisections

image of the immersion l a on the ep groupoids representing x a ev 1 d r m b sft a by admissibility in the prior steps and existence of scale smooth partitions of unity see remark a 6 these induce for every a h 2 m an admissible sc multisection a w a x a q which coincides with the prescribed data over x gwa a f a 1 x sft a thus on this closed subset we have general position and transver sality of the evaluation map 39 ev ev x x sfta a ssfta x 0 c m c m to 0 w p 0 w p for any pair of critical points p p crit f then the admissible sc multisection sfta w sft a q is constructed with these given boundary values and auxiliary norm and support prescribed by the coherent pairs controlling compactness using theorem a 9 36 benjamin filippenko katrin wehrheim to achieve general position on all of x

the transversality of the evaluation maps implies that the pullbacks a pr i are in general position they are also admissible with respect to the pullback of pairs controlling compactness this finishes the construction of the sc multisections claimed in i with the boundary restrictions required in iii proof of identity by linearity of all maps involved it suffices to fix two generators p p crit f of cm and check that p and ssp pss p 1 p d h p 1 p h d p have the same coefficient in on p that is we claim a h 2 m i p p a 0 z p p a t a p h a a h 2 m i p a i p a 0 z p a z p a t a a 1 p q crit f a h 2

p for q p 1 0 and m p q for p q 1 0 and general position of the sc multisections as in corollary 4 6 iii implies z for i 0 thus the right hand side can be rewritten as sum over pairs of moduli spaces with indices summing to zero and by 9 18 24 this is moreover equivalent to 0 i p a i p a i p p a a i p p a a 1 0 i p q a q p 1 i p p a 1 0 p q 1 i q p a i p p a 1 so all sums can be rewritten with the

second identity uses coherence of the ep groupoid as in 32 the third identity fol lows from coherence of sections s and sc multisections stated in ii iii and the fact from corollary 4 6 iv that perturbed zero sets z 0 x are contained in the interior of the polyfolds when the fredholm index is 0 for the second summand we moreover use lemma a 7 which ensures that each restriction p 1 f to a face f 0 x p a 0 x p a 1 xp p a given by p a p a is in general position to the section s p a s p a then its perturbed zero set z p p a f is contained in the interior 0 x p a x p a 0 x p a 0 x p a as the complement of the pairs of points x x with 0 p p a sp p a x x p a p a s p a s p a x x p a s p a x p a s p a x since a product in q q 0 is nonzero exactly when both factors are nonzero this

summary of polyfold theory this section gives an overview of the main notions of polyfold theory that are used in this paper the following language is used to describe settings with trivial isotropy 13 remark a 1 i an m polyfold without boundary is analogous to the notion of a banach manifold while the latter are locally homeomorphic to open subsets of a banach space an m polyfold is locally homeomorphic to the image o im of a retract u u of an open subset u e of a banach space e while is generally not classically differentiable it is required to be scale smooth sc with respect to a scale structure on e which is indicated by e i an m polyfold as defined in hwz def 2 8 is a paracompact hausdorff space x together with an atlas of charts u o 0 s e i e homeomorphisms between open sets u x and sc retracts o such that u x whose transition maps are sc smooth for k n 0 the k th boundary stratum kx is the set of all x x of degeneracy index d x k given 14 by the number of components equal to 0 for the point in a chart x 0 s e in particular 0 x is the interior of x ii a strong bundle over an m polyfold x as defined in hwz def 2 26 is a sc smooth sur jection p w x with linear structures on each fiber wx p 1 x for x x and an equivalence class of compatible strong bundle charts which in particular encode a sc smooth subbundle w w 1 x whose fiber inclusions w 1 x wx are compact and dense iii the notion of sc fredholm for a scale smooth section s x w of a strong bundle in hwz def 3 8 encodes elliptic regularity and a nonlinear contraction property hwz def 3 6 3 7 the latter is a stronger condition than the classical notion of linearizations being fredholm operators and is crucial to ensure an implicit function theorem see fzw 13 trivial isotropy would be guaranteed in our settings by an almost complex structure j for which there are no nonconstant j holomorphic spheres 14 the degeneracy index d x n 0 in hwz def 2 13 thm 2 3 is a priori independent of the choice of chart only for points in a dense subset x x specified in remark a 3 with that d x max lim sup d xi x xi x is well defined for all x x and can also be computed in any fixed chart a polyfold proof of the arnold conjecture 39 a more detailed survey of these trivial isotropy notions can be found in ffgw then the generalization to nontrivial isotropy is directly analogous to the notion of smooth sections of orbi bundles in which orbifolds are realizations of e tale proper groupoids mo remark a 2 a sc fredholm section b e of a strong polyfold bundle as introduced in hwz def 16 16 16 40 is a map between topological spaces together with an equivalence class of sc fredholm section functors s x w of strong bundles w over ep groupoids x whose realization s x w together with homeomorphisms x objx morx b and w e induces to summarize these notions we use conventions of hwz in denoting object and morphism spaces as objx x and morx x these will be equipped with m polyfold structures so that the k th boundary stratum of a polyfold b x is given as kb kx x x for all k n 0 i an ep groupoid as in hwz def 7 3 is a groupoid x x x equipped with m polyfold structures on the object and morphism sets such that all structure maps are local sc diffeomorphisms and every x x has a neighbourhood v x such that t s 1 clx v x x is proper as in hwz 7 4 we require that the realization x is paracompact and thus metrizable ii a strong bundle as in hwz def 8 4 over the ep groupoid x is a pair p of a strong bundle p w x and a strong bundle map xs pw w so that p lifts to a functor p w x from an ep groupoid w w w induced by p then p restricts to a functor w 1 x on the full subcategory whose object space is the sc smooth subbundle w 1 w iii a sc fredholm section functor of the strong bundle p w x as in hwz def 8 7 is a functor s x w that is sc smooth on object and morphism spaces satisfies p s idx and such that s x w is sc fredholm on the m polyfold x now a polyfold description of a compact moduli space m is a sc fredholm section b e of a strong polyfold bundle with zero set 1 0 m the polyfold descriptions used in this paper are obtained as fiber products of existing polyfolds and sc fredholm sections over them this requires a technical shift in levels described in the following remark and a notion of submersion below remark a 3 polyfolds carry a level structure b b 1 b 0 b as follows for any m polyfold x in particular the object space of the ep groupoid representing b x a sequence of dense subsets x x 1 x 0 x is induced by the scale structures e e m m n 0 of the charts that is xm 1 o r s e m then bm xm morx is well defined since morphisms of x locally represented by scale diffeomorphisms preserve the levels on objx x the restriction bm of a sc fredholm section b e is again sc fredholm with values in em and the choice of such a shift in levels is irrelevant for applications since the zero set 1 0 b as well as the perturbed zero set for any admissible perturbation is always contained in the so called smooth part that is densely contained in each level b bm for a finite dimensional manifold or orbifold m such as the morse trajectory spaces in 3 3 viewed as polyfold the level structure is trivial m m 1 m 0 m definition a 4 fi def 5 9 a sc functor f x m from an ep groupoid x x x to a finite dimensional manifold m is a submersion if for all x x the tangent map dxf t r xx tf x m is surjective where trxx is the reduced tangent space hwz def 2 15 consider in addition a sc fredholm section functor s x w then the sc functor f x m is s compatibly submersive if for all x x there exists a sc complement l t r xx of ker dxf t r xx and a tame sc fredholm chart for s at x fi def 5 4 in which the change of coordinates o 0 s rk s w that puts s in basic germ form which by tameness has the form v e v e for v e o 0 s e and a linear sc isomorphism moreover satisfies l 0 k s w where the chart identifies l trxx tr 0 o 0 e more generally given a smooth submanifold n m the sc functor f is transverse to n if for all x f 1 n x we have dxf t r xx tf x n tf x m and f is s compatibly transverse to n if there exists a sc complement l of dxf 1 tf x n t r xx satisfying the above condition the purpose of giving a moduli space a polyfold description is to utilize the perturbation theory for sc fredholm sections over polyfolds which allows to regularize the moduli space by associating to it a well defined cobordism class of weighted branched orbifolds for a technical statement 40 benjamin filippenko katrin wehrheim see corollary 4 6 and the references therein since the ambient space x is almost never locally compact this requires admissible perturbations of the section to preserve compactness of the zero set this admissibility is determined by the following data introduced in hwz def 12 2 15 4 definition a 5 a saturated open subset u x of an ep groupoid x x x is an open subset u x with 1 u u where x x x x is the projection to the realization a pair controlling compactness for a sc fredholm section s x w of a strong bundle p w x consists of an auxiliary norm n w 1 0 see hwz def 12 2 and a saturated open subset u x that contains the zero set s 1 0 u such that x u n s x 1 x has compact closure given such a pair a section s x w is n u admissible if n s x 1 and supp s u the construction of perturbations moreover requires scale smooth partitions of unity which will be guaranteed by the following standing assumptions remark a 6 throughout this paper we assume that the realizations x of ep groupoids are paracompact and the banach spaces e in all m polyfold charts are hilbert spaces this guarantees the existence of scale smooth partitions of unity by hwz 5 5 7 5 2 in order to guarantee the same on every level bm as discussed in remark a 3 we moreover assume that each scale structure e em m n 0 consists of hilbert spaces em these assumptions hold in applications such as the ones cited hwz 1 fh 1 then paracompactness and thus existence of scale smooth partitions of unity on every level is guaranteed by hwz prop 7 12 when discussing coherence of perturbations of a system of sc fredholm sections the boundaries are described in terms of cartesian products of polyfolds bundles and sections so we will make use of cartesian products of multivalued perturbations as follows to obtain multisections over the boundary as summarized in the subsequent remark lemma a 7 let s 1 x 1 w 1 and s 2 x 2 w 2 be sc fredholm section of strong bundles pi wi xi over ep groupoids then the cartesian product x 1 x 2 is naturally an ep groupoid and s 1 s 2 x 1 x 2 w 1 w 2 is a sc fredholm section of the strong bundle p 1 p 2 moreover if i wi q are sc multisections for i 1 2 then there is a well defined sc multisection 1 2 w 1 w 2 q given by 1 2 w 1 w 2 1 w 1 2 w 2 if for i 1 2 the sections i are ni ui admissible for some fixed pair controlling compactness as in definition a 5 then 1 2 is max n 1 n 2 u 1 u 2 admissible finally if i is in general position to si for i 1 2 then 1 2 is in general position to s 1 s 2 proof a detailed treatment of sc fredholmness of the product section s 1 s 2 can be found in fi lemma 7 2 the remaining statements follow easily from the definitions in hwz as do the statements in the first paragraph recall in particular from hwz def 13 4 that a sc multisection on a strong bundle p w x is a functor w q that is locally of the form w j w pj p w qj represented by sc sections p 1 pk v p 1 v i e sc sections of w 1 see hwz def 2 27 and weights q 1 qk q 0 with j qj 1 then for local sections p i j and weights q i j representing i for i 1 2 the multisection 1 2 is locally represented by the sections p 1 j p 2 j with weights q 1 j q 2 j and all admissibility and general position arguments are made at the level of these local sections in particular the ni ui admissibility can be phrased as the existence of local representations by sections with ni p i j x 1 and z si p i j x vi t 1 1 si x tp i j x ui then max n 1 n 2 u 1 u 2 admissibility uses the observation x 1 x 2 t 1 1 s 1 s 2 x 1 x 2 t p 1 j x 1 p 2 j x 2 z s 1 p 1 j z s 2 p 2 j u 1 u 2 remark a 8 let p w x be a strong bundle over a tame ep groupoid x x x then for every x x there is a chart ux o from a locally uniformizing 15 neighbourhood ux x of x to a sc retract o 0 n e with x 0 lying in the intersection of the n local faces fk 1 v e 0 n e vk 0 which cover the boundary x ux n k 1 fk 15 a neighbourhood ux x forms a local uniformizer as in hwz def 7 9 if the morphisms between points in ux are given by a local action of the isotropy group gx a polyfold proof of the arnold conjecture 41 now a sc multisection over the boundary is a functor p 1 x q whose restriction p 1 fk to each local face is a sc multisection of the strong bundle p 1 fk fk in the presence of a sc fredholm section s x w such a sc multisection is in general position over the boundary if for each intersection of faces fk k k fk x the restriction of the perturbed multi section s fk p 1 fk q has surjective linearizations at all solutions if moreover n u is a pair controlling compactness then is n u admissible if each restriction p 1 fk is admissible w r t the pair n p 1 fk u fk in our applications as described in assumption 6 3 the local faces fk are images of open subsets of global face immersions lf f x where each f is a cartesian product of two polyfolds and the restriction to the interior lf 0 f is an embedding into the top boundary stratum 1 x the bundles over each face are naturally identified with the pullbacks l fw and then the pushforwards of sc multisections f l fw q form a sc multisection over the boundary p 1 im f q if they agree on overlaps and self intersections of the immersions lf at the boundary f of the faces in this setting general position of is equivalent to general position of the multisections f the following perturbation theorem allows us to refine the construction of coherent perturbations in fh 1 for the sft moduli spaces such that moreover the evaluation maps from the perturbed solution sets are transverse to the unstable and stable manifolds in the symplectic manifold this is a generalization of the polyfold perturbation theorem over ep groupoids and the extension of transverse perturbations from the boundary hwz theorems 15 4 15 5 with norm bound given by h 1 for simplicity another version of this with the submanifolds representing cycles whose gromov witten invariants are then obtained as counts also appears in sch 1 sch 2 we are working under the assumptions made in this section e g paracompactness without further mention the limitation to finitely many submanifolds in the extension result seems to be of technical nature we expect that joint work of the first author with dusa mcduff on coherent finite dimensional reductions of polyfold fredholm sections will establish the result for countably many submanifolds theorem a 9 suppose s x w is a sc fredholm section functor of a strong bundle p w x over a tame ep groupoid x with compact solution set s 1 0 x and let n u be a pair controlling compactness moreover let e x m be a sc 0 map to a finite dimensional manifold m which has a sc submersive restriction e v v m on a saturated open set v x then for any countable collection of smooth submanifolds ci m i i with e 1 i i ci v there exists an n u admissible sc multisection w q so that s is in general position see hwz definition 15 6 and the restriction e z z m to the perturbed zero set z x x s x 0 is in general position 16 to the submanifolds ci for all i i moreover suppose i is finite and p 1 x q for some 0 1 is an 1 n u admissible structurable sc multisection in general position over the boundary such that the restric tion e z z m to the perturbed zero set in the boundary z x x s x 0 is in general position 17 to the submanifolds ci for all i i then above can be chosen with p 1 x proof our proof follows the perturbation procedure of hwz theorem 15 4 which proves the special case when there is no condition on a map e x m i e when m pt and ci pt to obtain the desired transversality of e to the submanifolds ci m we will go through the proof and indicate adjustments in three steps a local stabilization construction which adds a finite dimensional parameter space to cover the cokernels near a point x s 1 0 a local to global argument which combines the local constructions into a global stabilization which covers the cokernels near s 1 0 and a global sard argument which shows that regular values yield transverse perturbations within these arguments we need to consider restrictions to any intersection of faces to ensure general position to the boundary use submersivity of e to achieve transversality to the ci and work with multisections due to isotropy the statement with prescribed boundary values generalizes the extension result hwz theorem 15 5 which hinges on the fact that general position 16 general position to ci requires transversality to ci of each restriction e z fk to the perturbed solution set within an intersection of local faces fk k k fk as defined in remark a 8 including for f z 17 this requires general position of each restriction e z fk to a local face fk x as defined in remark a 8 42 benjamin filippenko katrin wehrheim over the boundary persists in an open neighbourhood something that is generally guaranteed only for finitely many transversality conditions see the end of this proof the first step in any construction of perturbations is the existence of local stabilizations which cover the cokernels as follows local stabilization constructions for every zero x s 1 0 of the unperturbed sc fredholm section we construct a finite dimensional parameter space rl for l lx n 0 and sc multisection x rl w q t w 7 xt w such that x 0 is the trivial multisection i e x 0 0 1 x 0 w 0 for w wxr 0 this multisection x is viewed as local perturbation near 0 x of a sc fredholm section functor s x of a bundle p x s x rl x rl w p x rl w rl x t y 7 t s y t w 7 t p w it is constructed in hwz to be structurable in the sense of hwz def 13 17 in general position in the sense that the linearization t s x x 0 x t 0 r l trxx wx is surjective 18 and admissible in the sense that the domain support of x is contained in u and the auxiliary norm is bounded linearly n t y cx t for some constant cx in case x v s 1 0 we refine this construction to require surjectivity of the restrictions 42 t s x x 0 x t 0 rl kx t 0 r l kx wx wherekx ker dxe trx x t r xx is the kernel of the linearization dxe t r xx te x m restricted to the reduced tangent space for that purpose note that e is sc near x by assumption so has a well defined linearization and since its codomain is finite dimensional its kernel has finite codimension moreover imdxs wx has finite codimension by the sc fredholm property of s and the reduced tangent space trxx txx has finite codimension by the definition of m polyfolds with corners thus we can find finitely many vectors w 1 wl wx which together with dxs kx span wx these vectors are extended to sc sections of the form pj t y tjw j y multiplied with sc cutoff functions of sufficiently small support and pulled back by local isotropy actions to construct the functor x as in hwz thm 15 4 we claim that this yields the following local properties with respect to the sc functor e x rl v m t y 7 e y local stabilization properties there exists x 0 and a locally uniformizing neighborhood q x x of x whose closure is contained in u such that 43 x t rl t x q x q t y 7 xt s y x s x t y is a tame ep subgroupoid and for t y supp x t y x t y 0 rl x the reduced linearizations tr s x x t y t s x x t y ttrl try x are surjective moreover if x v then we may choose q x v such that for all t y supp x we have surjections 19 d t y e x nxt y n x t y kert r s x x t y te y m in particular the realization supp x is a weighted branched orbifold and e x induces a submer sion supp x m in the sense of definition a 4 moreover for all y s 1 0 ux we have 0 y supp x so that the reduced linearizations tr s x x 0 y and the restriction to their kernel d 0 y e x nx 0 y are surjective these properties persist for y s 1 0 with y q x the structure of supp x and surjectivity of linearizations tr s x x follows from the local implicit function theorem hwz theorems 15 2 15 3 then the kernels nxt y kert r s x x t y represent the reduced tangent spaces at t y to the weighted branched orbifold supp x surjectivity of d 0 x e x nx 0 x holds since d 0 x e x is surjective by assumption and the preimage of any given vector in te x m can be adjusted by vectors in kerd 0 x e x to lie in nx 0 x kert r s x x 0 x 18 this is shorthand for s x pj having surjective linearization for every section pj in a local representation of x with s x 0 x 0 pj 0 x and restricted to the reduced tangent space t r x x 19 as before this is shorthand for surjectivity on each reduced tangent space kerd t y s x pj ttrl try x a polyfold proof of the arnold conjecture 43 because t s x x t y kerd 0 x e x is surjective by 42 then e x restricts to a map supp x m that is classically smooth on each finite dimensional branch of supp x and thus surjectivity of d t y e x nxt y is an open condition along each branch since supp x is locally compact in particular with finitely many branches near x we can then choose x and q x sufficiently small to guarantee that each d t y e x nxt y is surjective this proves submersivitiy in the sense of definition a 4 from local to global stabilization in this portion of the proof we proceed almost verba tim to the corresponding portion of hwz thm 15 4 with extra considerations to deduce sub mersivity of 46 by assumption s 1 0 is compact and e x m is continuous then s 1 0 e 1 c is compact since c i i ci m is closed we moreover have the identity s 1 0 e 1 c s 1 0 e 1 c since both sets are saturated thus we have an open cov ering q x x s 1 0 e 1 c by the open subsets chosen above and can pick finitely many points x 1 xr s 1 0 e 1 c to obtain a finite open cover s 1 0 e 1 c r i 1 q xi then s 1 0 r r i 1 q xi is compact with open cover by q x x s 1 0 so we may pick further xr 1 xk s 1 0 to obtain the covers s 1 0 k i 1 q xi s 1 0 e 1 c r i 1 q xi 44 s 1 0 q 1 k i 1 q xi u for each x xi we constructed above a family of sc multisections xit w q t r lxi these are summed up using hwz def 13 11 to a sc multisection rl w q t t 1 tk w 7 t w x 1 t 1 xk tk w for l lx 1 lxk here each t w q for t rl is a structurable sc multisection by hwz prop 13 3 we view the multisection as global perturbation of a sc fredholm section functor s of a bundle p s rl x rl w w p rl w rl x t y 7 t s y t w 7 t p w and claim that e x m induces a submersion on its perturbed solution set in the following sense global stabilization properties there exists 0 0 such that for every 0 0 45 t rl t x q t y 7 t s y s t y is a tame ep subgroupoid with surjective reduced linearizations tr s t y for all t y supp in particular the realization supp is a weighted branched orbifold moreover there is a neigh bourhood v x of s 1 0 e 1 c such that 46 e supp supp m t y 7 e y satisfies e supp 1 c rl v and its restriction to supp rl v is classically smooth and submersive as in definition a 4 note that the auxiliary norm n on w pulls back to an auxiliary norm n on w and compactness of s is controlled in the sense that for any compact subset k rl we have compactness of 47 t x k u n s t x 1 k x u n s x 1 rl x next the restriction of to each rlxi x rl x is the local perturbation xi of s xi since we identify rlxi t 1 tk r l tj 0 j 6 i and each xj 0 is trivial in particular 0 is the trivial multisection with n 0 0 moreover we have an estimate n t c t that results from the linear estimates on each xit now for 0 1 c we can deduce compactness of the stabilized solution set as closed subset of 47 48 z t x rl x t 0 t s x 0 44 benjamin filippenko katrin wehrheim the next step is to argue that 48 is smooth in a neighbourhood of z 0 x 0 s 1 0 recall here that q 1 k i 1 q xi x is an open neighbourhood of s 1 0 so for any x q we can use the local properties of some xi with x q xi to deduce surjectivity of tr s 0 x then the local implicit function theorems hwz thms 15 2 15 3 rmk 15 2 yield an open neighbourhood u 0 x t x u x r l x of 0 x for some 0 x 0 and hence a saturated neighbourhood u 0 x t x 1 u x rl x such that u 0 x s u 0 x is a tame branched ep subgroupoid of u 0 x as a consequence the orbit space of the support supp u 0 x is a weighted branched orbifold with boundary and corners for x s 1 0 re 1 c we can moreover choose u x e 1 c since e 1 c x is closed for x s 1 0 e 1 c v the covering 44 guarantees x q xi for some 1 i r with q xi v and we choose u x q xi this guarantees that the restriction of e r l x m t y 7 e y to u 0 x is sc and surjectivity of d 0 x e xi kertr s xi xi 0 x implies surjectivity of d 0 x e n 0 x n 0 x te x m on n 0 x kert r s 0 x here n 0 x represents the reduced tangent space at 0 x to the weighted branched orbifold supp u 0 x now e supp u 0 x supp u 0 x m is classically smooth since it is a restriction of an sc map to finite dimensions and we have shown it to be submersive at 0 x hence by openness of submersivity along each corner stratum and local compactness of supp u 0 x z it follows that u 0 x r l v can be chosen sufficiently small to ensure that e supp u 0 x is submersive as in definition a 4 now compactness of s 1 0 e 1 c and s 1 0 again allows us to find finite covers s 1 0 k i 1 u x i s 1 0 e 1 c r i 1 u x i with x i s 1 0 e 1 c for i 1 r and u x i e 1 c for r i k then we have min x 1 x k 0 an open cover s 1 0 a 1 k i 1 u x i and the functor t rl t a q t y 7 t s y is a tame branched ep subgroupoid since it is the restriction of s to an open subset of k i 1 u 0 x i moreover we claim that for a possibly smaller 0 0 we have 49 t y t x t y 0 y a by contradiction consider a sequence rl tn 0 yn x with tn yn 0 but yn xra then compactness of 48 guarantees a convergent subsequence tn yn 0 y z and since z 0 x 0 supp 0 s 0 s 1 0 this contradicts the fact that yn x r a where a k i 1 u x i x is an open neighbourhood of s 1 0 thus we have shown 49 and can deduce that s t rl t x q is a tame branched ep subgroupoid with supp rl a and thus supp rl k i 1 u x i is a weighted branched orbifold with boundary and corners as claimed moreover from the properties of e supp u 0 x i for i 1 r we know that the restriction of e to supp rl v for v 1 r i 1 u x i v is classically smooth and submersive here we have e 1 c a v since u xi for i r was chosen disjoint from e 1 c and hence we have e supp 1 c supp r l e 1 c rl e 1 c a rl v and thus e supp supp m is classically smooth and submersive in the sense of definition a 4 in the open neighborhood supp rl v of e supp 1 ci supp for all i i global transversality from regular values as we continue to follow the proof of hwz thm 15 4 we replace each application of the sard theorem by countably many sard arguments to obtain general position to the countably many submanifolds ci m for i i for that purpose we will consider various restrictions of the projection supp t y rl x t t s y 0 rl t y 7 t a polyfold proof of the arnold conjecture 45 the global properties of imply that every t 0 y 0 supp has a saturated open neighborhood u t 0 y 0 t r l t t 0 1 u y 0 r l x satisfying the following u y 0 x admits the natural action of the isotropy groupgy 0 see hwz thm 7 1 satisfies the properness property hwz def 7 17 and has dx y 0 local faces f y 0 1 f y 0 dx y 0 which contain y 0 see hwz def 2 21 prop 2 14 the branched ep subgroupoid supp u t 0 y 0 has a local branching structure t y t s y 1 j j j t y m t 0 y 0 j given by finitely many properly embedded submanifolds with boundary and corners m t 0 y 0 j u t 0 y 0 which intersect any intersection of local faces in a manifold with boundary and corners on each branchm t 0 y 0 j the reduced linearizations t r s t y are surjective for all t y m t 0 y 0 j and the restriction of e supp is a submersion m t 0 y 0 j r l v m in general position to the boundary in the sense of definition a 4 that is d t y e nt y nt y te y m is surjective on nt y kert r s t y for all t y m t 0 y 0 j r l v there is a countable cover supp z u t y indexed by t y z supp since r l x and hence its subspace supp is second countable and every open cover of a second countable space has a countable subcover moreover for any given z there are finitely many choices f k t t 0 k k f y k u t y of intersections of finitely many local faces k 1 dx y with f u t y finally for each z and intersection of faces f k there are finitely many smooth manifolds f k m t y j indexed by j j for each of these countably many choices sard s theorem asserts that f k m t y j r l t y 7 t has an open and dense subset r k j r l of regular values then since rl is a baire space the set of common regular values r 0 z k j r k j r l is still dense for any t 0 r 0 the sc multisection t 0 w q is in general position by the usual linear algebra for each restriction of the linearized operators to intersections of faces consider t 0 x 0 f k m t y j supp and a local section s p j in the representation of s with m t y j s p j 1 0 the surjective differential along this intersection of faces can be written as dt 0 x 0 s p j f k d l where l is a bounded operator arising from differentiating pj in the direction of rl and d is the reduced linearization on the intersection of faces fk k k f y k u y x of the section s p j t 0 that is a part of the representation of t 0 s then regularity of t 0 implies surjectivity of the projection ker d l rl which in turn is equivalent to surjectivity of d see e g ms lemma a 3 6 moreover each t for t is n u admissible thus any sufficiently small regular t 0 r 0 yields an admissible sc multisection t 0 in general position as in hwz thm 15 4 to prove our theorem we have to moreover choose t 0 r 0 so that the restriction e z z m to the solution set z supp s is in general position to ci m for all i i for that purpose we consider the countably many projections 50 e 1 ci f k m t y j r l t x 7 t for any i i index z of the countable cover intersection of local faces f k and smooth branch m t y j supp u t y here we have e 1 ci m t y j e supp 1 c so that the restriction e f k m t y j f k m t y j m is smooth and submersive in a neighborhood of e 1 ci in particular it is transverse to ci so that there is a natural smooth structure on e 1 ci f k m t y j thus we can apply the sard theorem to each 50 to find open and dense subsets t i k j r l of regular values and a dense set of common regular values t 0 z k j r k j i t i k j r l note that t 0 r 0 so sufficiently small t 0 t 0 yield admissible sc multisections t 0 in general position moreover general position of e z z m to ci at x z e 1 ci means that the linearizations of e fk z map onto te x m te x ci for each intersection of local faces fk u y x that 46 benjamin filippenko katrin wehrheim contains x here the tangent spaces of fk z at x are given by those of f k m t y j t 0 x for each branch with t 0 x m t y j supp so we need to ensure surjectivity of d t 0 x e ker te x m te x ci on the kernel of the projection t t 0 x f k m t y j rl here d t 0 x e t t 0 x f k m t y j te x m is surjective since e supp is submersive and regularity t 0 t i k j means that we have d t 0 x e 1 te x ci r l so for any y te x m we find t x t t 0 x f k m t y j with d t 0 x e t x y and t x d t 0 x e 1 te x ci so that 0 x x ker proves the required surjectivity d t 0 x e 0 x x y d t 0 x e t x y te x m te x ci thus this choice of sufficiently small t 0 t 0 also guarantees general position of e z to each of the countably many submanifolds ci which finishes the proof of the theorem when no boundary values are prescribed regular extension to prove the last paragraph of the theorem we consider a given 1 n u admissible structurable sc multisection p 1 x q that is in general position over the boundary and with e z z supp s x m in general position to finitely many submani folds ci then we will adjust the above construction of w q to also satisfy p 1 x by following the proof of the transversal extension theorem over ep groupoids hwz thm 15 5 since is supported in u x with n x for all x x we can find a continuous functor h x 0 1 supported in u with n x h x 1 2 n x 1 2 for all x x then hwz thm 14 2 yields a sc multisection w q with p 1 x domain support in u and n x h x 1 2 for all x x this guarantees compactness of supp s x and regularity of supp s x supp s x to obtain regularity in the interior we construct t by the above arguments with s 1 0 replaced by s supp s x noting that s x is also compact to achieve general position to the ci we need further adjustments local constructions relative to boundary values for interior points x s 0 x we construct x rl w q with domain support in the interior rl 0 x u to cover the cokernels of tr s x for the stabilized multisection rl w q t w 7 w for x s x we need no stabilization by a rl factor i e take l 0 due to the general position of at x however we only obtain general position to the ci rather than submersivity in the following claim local properties relative to boundary for each x s there exists lx n 0 with lx 0 for x s x and a locally uniformizing neighborhood q x x of x whose closure is contained in u such that for some x 0 we have a tame ep subgroupoid x t rl t x q x q t y 7 xt s y with surjective reduced linearizations and thus a weighted branched orbifold supp x moreover if x s v then e x induces a smooth map supp x m which is in general position to ci for each i i the structure of x is established in hwz thm 15 5 and the general position to each ci for x 0 x follows from submersivity to achieve general position to the ci for x x recall that c i i ci m is closed so for x e 1 c we can choose q x disjoint from e 1 c so that general position to the ci c is automatic for x e 1 c v we have e supp x x supp s x m in general position to each ci by assumption on moreover we choose q x v so that e q x supp x m is smooth and thus general position to each ci extends to a neighbourhood qi x of x then q i i qi is a neighbourhood of x since i is finite and we can replace q x by a uniformizing neighbourhood in q to achieve general position to all ci from local to global relative to boundary this portion of the proof is started by picking a finite cover s x supp s x 0 i k q xi x by the above neighbourhoods for xi s x next we cover s 0 i k q xi k i 1 q xi with neighbourhoods of interior points xi s 0 x whose associated multisections xi are supported in the interior dom supp xi rlx 0 x then we define r l w q by t w t w x 1 t 1 xk tk w this multisection is constructed so that 0 and t p 1 x for any t rl moreover the estimate n t n c t 1 2 c t allows us to guarantee admissibility n t 1 by choosing t 1 2 c then compactness of z in 48 follows as above a polyfold proof of the arnold conjecture 47 and its smoothness is established using a covering s 1 0 k i k u x i where u x i for i 0 arise from x i s x and cover a neighbourhood of x moreover u x i r l q x i can be chosen as in the prior proof of the local properties such that e supp u x i m is in general position to ci for each i i this establishes the following global stabilization properties with fixed boundary values there exists 0 0 such that s t x q is a tame ep subgroupoid with surjective reduced linearizations for every 0 0 in particular supp is a weighted branched orbifold moreover there is a neighbourhood v x of s 1 0 e 1 c such that e supp supp m satisfies e supp 1 c rl v and its restriction to supp rl v is classically smooth and in general position to each ci global transversality relative to boundary in this final step we use the fact that t is n u admissible for t 1 2 c and choose a common regular value of countably many projections as before the only difference to the proof above is that the restriction of e supp to a branch m t 0 y 0 j r l v m is not necessarily submersive but still in general position to each of the ci that is d t y e nt y nt y te y m te y ci is surjective for each i i when considering the projections 50 this suffices to obtain smooth structures on e 1 ci f k m t y j for each branch and intersection of faces f k then general position of e z z m to ci at x z e 1 ci for t 0 with a regular value t 0 r l again requires surjectivity of d t 0 x e ker te x m te x ci on the kernel of the projection t t 0 x f k m t y j rl to see that y te x m te x ci is in the image we use the above surjectivity of d t 0 x e nt 0 x to find t x t t 0 x f k m t y j with d t 0 x e t x y then regularity of t 0 yields t x d t 0 x e 1 te x ci so that 0 x x ker solves d t 0 x e 0 x x y d t 0 x e t x y te x m te x ci this finishes the proof with prescribed boundary values references a v arnold sur une proprie te topologique des
