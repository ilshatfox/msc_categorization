em bedding corresponding extensions are given for the bourgain brezis mironescu theorem and pitt s inequality new results are obtained for diagonal trace restriction on submanifolds as an application of the hardy littlewood sobolev inequality smoothing estimates are used to provide new structural understanding for density functional theory the coulomb interaction energy and quantum mechanics of phase space intriguing connections are drawn that illustrate interplay among classical inequalities in fourier analysis 1 multilinear embedding a problem of central interest for embedding is how to characterize the action of multilinear fractional smoothing that is control by the operator f x 1 xm m k 1 k 4 2 k 2 f x 1 xm f 1 k k k f 1 m x 1 xm 1 where f s rmn xk rn 1 m k 0 k n k is the standard laplacian on rn in the variable xk and ff f e 2 ix f x dx examples of how such control can be utilized are contained in 7 8 9 14 our objective here is to consider a corresponding functional suggested by the aronszajn smith formula ip f rmn rmn xk yk n p k w x y 1 y f w 1 wm p dx dy 2 where f s rmn 1 m 0 k 1 1 p n k for all k and y counts the number of y values in the expression f w 1 w 2 wm for

the utilization of iteration methods and the product structure suggests that the issue here is not a true multilinear problem and that product functions will likely characterize results theorem 1

3 on page 187 2 diagonal trace restriction the objective here is to develop an overall framework for the structure of multilinear con volution operators and the representation of the hardy littlewood sobolev inequality from the perspective defined by multilinear sobolev embedding to enable a better understanding for the role of geometric symmetry and the application of duality arguments diagonal trace restriction is considered in the context of a lower dimensional manifold namely the unit sphere this approach extends the structure of classical trace inequalities from harmonic extension of bound ary values for the upper half space or the interior of the unit ball see 1 16 to restriction phenomena on surfaces with curvature questions about restriction for the fourier transform on manifolds with curvature and strichartz inequalities involve greater depth and subtlety as illustrated by the original stein tomas inequality determination of sharp constants for diagonal trace restriction estimates was initiated in 7 and extended in 9 motivated by the principal results from 7 theorems 1 and 2 restriction estimates are obtained here for the sphere sn 1 first consider the

provides the following restriction result for a spherical surface as determined by fractional smoothness this result was obtained earlier by bez machihara and sugimoto personal communication see 11 from the representa tion of the hardy littlewood sobolev inequality as a smoothing estimate one expects similar estimates to hold for any conformally equivalent setting see equation 10 above and

the special case m 1 in the previous argument and demonstrates that such estimates additionally hold for spherical restriction for all positive indices below the critical index q 2 n 1 n 2 to gain a better sense of the contrast for this trace estimate between harmonic extentsion of boundary values and global embedding set 1 and raise the dimension by one so that critical index is given by q 2 n n

harmonic extension of f to the interior of the unit ball in rn 1 both inequalities are sharp and the doubling factor seems natural in view of symmetry a precise derivation of the relation between the two inequalities using symmetrization is given in the appendix the possibility of considering a spherical trace diagonal restriction corresponding to pitt s inequality is less natural because the estimate is taken over a compact domain and the critical index for embedding is not used the nature of pitt s inequality depends on the dilation character of the smoothing operator which will not play a new role for restriction on a compact manifold moreover in contrast to the non compact setting where extremals do not exist one expects that in the compact case extremals are likely to exist functionals for multilinear fractional embedding 7 3 diagonal trace restriction on submanifolds trace restriction from either the vantage point of harmonic extension or understanding mod els for many body dynamics using the gross pitaevskii hierarchy of density matrices seems naturally associated with control determined by multilinear fractional sobolev embedding but diagonal trace restriction on submanifolds is more directly a consequence of the hardy littlewood sobolev embedding estimates including more general formulations first a very general principle is outlined and then explicit applications are developed including the case of flat submanifolds hardy littlewood sobolev principle submanifold restriction for f s rmn k a smooth submanifold of rn denotes a surface measure on k

lp k 17 where p is the dual exponent to q and mn 2 k the classical sense of trace operator is associated with harmonic extension and solutions of differential equations but here consideration of diagonal trace restriction suggests a broader mechanism that couples fractional sobolev embedding with estimates for multilinear potential operators and application of the hardy littlewood sobolev inequality to obtain optimal bounds without being exhaustive examples are given to suggest the range of results that may be obtained using diagonal trace restriction on submanifolds including both

the coulomb interaction energy by fractional smoothing is more an r n result than an r 2 n result as given in theorem 10 this characterization is made explicit by combining pitt s inequality with the

increase substantially a simple example that results from an application of the hardy littlewood sobolev inequality and could relate to multiparticle interaction is given by rn rn rn x y z f x f y f z dx dy dz b f lp rn 3 39 for 3 n p and p 3 but how the optimal constant b could be calculated is unclear the critical question to understand here is the character of metrics that span multiple points by adapting theorem 11 to the case of product functions a novel representation of coulomb interaction forms is outlined which appears to be formulated using the structure of the hardy littlewood sobolev inequality but is in fact a realization of pitt s inequality while the most direct proof of this results is obtained from pitt s inequality an alternative proof can be given using a combination of the hardy littlewood sobolev inequality the reverse hardy littlewood sobolev inequality and the hausdorff young inequality this appears to be one of the first examples where the reverse hardy littlewood sobolev inequality has an interesting application part of this inequality was already used in carneiro s thesis see pages 3133 3134 in 15 theorem 14 for s rn 0 n rn rn x y x 2 y 2 dx

terms of multiple interaction and retaining reverse estimates suggests the following inequalities that extend equation 39 for the case mn p p m and adapt similar arguments used for the proof of theorem 11 theorem 15 for f s rmn 0 n rmn xk f x 1 xm 2 dx f rmn k f 1 m 2 d 42 rmn xk xk 2 dx f rmn k k 2 d 43 f m n 4 n 4 2 for mn p p m p mn mn q mn mn rmn xk f xk dx c 1 f lp rn m 44 rmn k g k d c

hardy littlewood sobolev inequalities 44 and 45 the first inequality is obtained by iterating the following reduction so that the estimate depends on the case m 2 which is the original hardy littlewood sobolev inequality first use rearrangement and symmetrization to reduce the problem to the case where f is radial decreasing rmn xk f xk dx rmn xk f xk dx where f is the equimeasurable radial decreasing rearrangement of f on rn then observe that f x c f lp rn x n p x x n p c x n p so that rmn xk mn p f xk dx 1 dxm c f lp rn r m 1 n xk m 1 n p f xk dx 1 dxm 1 continuing this iteration one obtains the reduction rmn xk mn p f xk dx c f lp rn m 2 rn rn f x x y 2 n p f y dx dy and the proof of inequality 44 is obtained by using the hardy littlewood sobolev inequality the second inequality 45 is obtained by iterating a similar reduction to the one just used so that the estimate depends on the case m 2 which is the reverse hardy littlewood sobolev functionals for multilinear fractional embedding 21 inequality see appendix again use rearrangement and symmetrization to reduce the problem to the case where g is radial decreasing rmn k g k d rmn k g k d where g is the equimeasurable radial decreasing rearrangement of g on rn here one uses the following variation on the brascamp lieb luttinger rearrangement inequality for the function h being radial and

set r s 0 r s s 1 with 1 s 1 s q then g 1 r g q 1 rewriting the relation for q gives s 1 q s q which implies s q since q 1 using the relation for q with respect to q mn mn three equivalent defining

the proof of inequality 45 is obtained from the reverse hardy littlewood sobolev inequal ity these two expanded hardy littlewood sobolev estimates combined with the hausdorff young inequality give a proof without sharp constants for inequality 43 choose p so that for 0 n mn p then using 44 45 and the hausdorff young inequality for r 2 mn mn 2 p 2 and r 2 mn mn 2 q 2 rmn xk xk 2 dx c lr rn 2 m c

recent papers identify the intrinsic character of the hardy littlewood sobolev inequality the starting point would be the fractional integral defined by the riesz potential f lp rn 1 x f lp rn 46 with 1 p 2 1 p 1 p 1 and 2 n p here conformal invariance enables calculation of the sharp constant for the operator norm 19 1 x f lp rn ap f lp rn 47 ap n p n 1 p 1 2 n p n n 2 2 p 1 later it was recognized that an inherent axial symmetry would lead to an equivalent represen tation on the liouville beltrami model for hyperbolic space and provide a quick determination of the extremal functions for the optimal inequality this calculation demonstrated how hyper bolic symmetry is embedded in the conformal structure of the riesz functional 3 because of the inequality s structure as a map from a space to its dual one can utilize the square integrable paradigm to give an equivalent representation for the hardy littlewood sobolev inequality in terms of fractional smoothness functionals for multilinear fractional embedding 23 lemma for f s rn 1 p 2 n 1 p 1 2 and 1 p 1 p 1 rn f 2 dx cp rn 4 2 2 f p dx 2 p 48 rn g p dx 2 p cp rn 4 2 2 f 2 dx 49 cp n p n 2 n p n p n n 2 2 p 1 and the hardy littlewood sobolev inequality can be viewed as a positive definite symmetric bilinear quadratic form rn rn f x x y f y dx dy ap f p 2 2 n p 50 these inequalities suggest that the defining structure of the hardy littlewood sobolev inequal ity should be equally identified with its representation in terms of fractional smoothness rather than simply in terms of the riesz potential to be more explicit the hardy littlewood sobolev inequality can be understood in terms of control determined by fractional smoothness while the role of the riesz potential may be most useful in calculating formulas for sharp constants to characterize that control this perspective provides critical insight for extending both the mul tilinear character and the domain manifold structure for which one can calculate

estimates symmetrization on the multiplicative group r allows one to obtain a direct relation between the estimates 14 and 15 here taken on rn 1 consider for n 1 2 and f x g rn 1 f 2 dx rn 1 x g 2 dx rn 1 x 2 g x 1 r 2 dx rn 1 x 2 n g 2 2 x 1 g g r 2 x 2 g 2 dr dv view g as a function of r and sn with s denoting the spherical gradient r x r x x and d being standard surface measure on the unit

denotes for each sn the non negative equimeasurable symmetric decreasing re arrangement of g r away from the origin r 1 and as a function of r now the expression above may be rephrased for f x g as 2

unit ball and using dirichlet s principle x 1 h 2 dx x 1 u 2 dx for any h which is a smooth extension of g to the interior of the unit ball and g sup r 0 g r g f hence putting all the steps together inequality 15 obtained by using the dual spectral form of the hardy littlewood sobolev inequality on the sphere sn see page 233 in 1 together with symmetrization on the multilplicative group r results in a second derivation of inequality 14 sn f q d 2 q bn rn 1 f 2 dx bn 1 4 n 1 2 n 1 2 still theorem 4 from which inequality 14 is obtained is a more general result as it includes fractional smoothing and by explicit symmetric extension on r can be used to obtain inequal ity 15 for harmonic extension on the unit ball in rn 1 3 proof of the reverse hardy littlewood sobolev inequality the conformal invariant structure of the hardy littlewood sobolev inequality can be contin ued across the lebesgue index p 1 where for non negative functions the inequality reverses theorem 16 reverse hardy littlewood sobolev inequality let f g lp rn with f g 0 0 p 1 and 2 n p p 2 n 2 n then rn rn f x x y g y dx dy a f lp rn g lp rn 53 a 2 n 2 n 2 n n 2 1 n with extremal functions given up to conformal

equimeasurable radial decreasing rearrangements of f g the next step is to reduce the problem to the multiplicative group r or equivalently the line r set h u x n pf x k v y n pg y where u x v y then the inequality becomes r r h u k v sn 1 sn 1 u v v u 2 2 d d du u dv v b h lp r k lp r 54 observe that h k are bounded so that h k lp r l r the potential is now symmetric increasing away from the origin u 1 on r so symmetrization will improve the inequality by diminishing the left hand side so that h 1 u h u is monotone decreasing for u 1 similarly for k this step then implies that inequality 53 is improved if 1 f is radial decreasing 2 x n pf x is decreasing for x 1 and 3 f x 1 x 2 n pf x all for nonnegative f these conditions are precisely what is meant by saying that f and g possess inversion symmetry set u et and v es so that the working inequality becomes r r h t k s sn 1 sn 1 cosh t s 2 d d dt ds c h lp r k lp r 55 normalize this expression by setting h lp r k lp r 1 let sn 1 sn 1 cosh t 2 d d jn t kn t where jn is supported on t n and kn is supported on t n first show that for h p k p 1 inf r r h t k s sn 1 sn 1 cosh t s 2 d d dt ds c 0 this fact follows from the reverse young s inequality where r r h t k s k 1 t s dt ds k 1 lp 2 r 0 so the positive infimum c exists the second objective is to show the existence of extremals where the infimum is attained consider sequences hm km with hm p km 1 so that m r r hm t km s sn 1 sn 1 cosh t s 2 d d dt dt m c and 2 c m c the functions hm km will be symmetric decreasing and uniformly bounded by a multiple of 1 t 1 p where 0 p 1 so that they have a uniform l 1 r majorant since the functions are decreasing the helly selection principle can be applied to choose sub sequences that converge almost everywhere to functions h and k with h p 1 k p 1 to simplify notation the pointwise convergent sequences are now substituted in place of the original sequences by fatou s lemma x r r h t k s sn 1 sn 1 cosh t s 2 d d dt ds lim m c past arguments have used a uniform majorant for the sequential functions to show that limit and integral can be interchanged for the potential functional see discussion on page 40 in 2 and the proof of theorem 15 on the multilinear hardy littlewood sobolev inequality in 10 a contrasting strategy is utilized here where control by the potential functional combined with the monotonicity of the functions and the uniform l 1 majorants will show that r hm t e 2 t dt d 1 hm t d 2 e 2 t functionals for multilinear fractional embedding 29 and similarly for km which gives 1 lim hm p dt h p dt 1 lim km p dt k p dt since h and k have unit norms c infimum and h k are extremal functions for the reverse hardy littlewood sobolev inequality in returning to the rn setting there will be extremal functions f g with inversion symmetry the conformal structure of the hardy littlewood sobolev functional will determine allowed forms for the extremal functions from which the constant a in equation 53 can be calculated since the functional is bilinear the most direct approach is use conformal symmetry on the sphere sn for sn let f x 1 x 2 n pf and g y 1 y 2 n pg then rn rn x y f x g y dx dy c sn sn f g d d c 2 n n 2 n 2 where d d denote normalized surface measure on sn with the map from rn to sn defined by 2 x 1 x 2 1 x 2 1 x 2 d n 2 n n 2 1 x 2 n dx x y 1 2 1 x 2 1 y 2 1 2 then inequality 53 has an equivalent formulation on the n dimensional sphere sn sn f g d d b f lp sn g lp sn 56 b sn d 2 n n 2 n 2 n 2 because only two functions are involved two point symmetrization can be used to show that the inequality must be improved by rearranged functions that depend only on the polar angle and are decreasing away from a pole but the inequality cannot be improved so the extremal functions at this stage must combine two properties a monotone decreasing away from a pile b possess inversion symmetry which on the sphere means that functions are symmetric with respect to an equator then up to conformal automorphism the only possible extremals on sn are constant and this remark completes the proof of theorem 16 for the dimension n at least two an alternative determination of the form of the extremals can be obtained using the hyperbolic symmetry of the hardy littlewood sobolev functional for 2 n with the poincare distance and left invariant haar measure

radial symmetry on rn in 53 and geodesic radial symmetry on h in 57 will determine the form of the extremals see the argument given in 3 concerning axial symmetry and sl 2 r and the proof of theorem
