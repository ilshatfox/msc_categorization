ar x iv 1 40 7 36 55 v 1 m at h f a 1 4 ju l 20 14 an extension of james s compactness theorem i gasparis abstract let x and y be banach spaces and f by endow y with the topology f of point wise convergence on f assume that t x y is a bounded linear operator which is w f continuous assume further that every vector in the range of t attains its norm at some element of f that is for every x x there exists y f such that t x y tx then t is w w continuous the proof relies on rosenthal s 1 theorem as a corollary to the above result one obtains an alternative proof of james s compactness theorem that a bounded subset k of a banach space e is relatively weakly compact provided that each functional in e attains its supremum on k 1 introduction james s famous characterization of reflexivity 9 states that a banach space x is reflexive if and only if every bounded linear functional on x attains its norm at an element of bx subsequently james 10 character ized the weakly compact subsets of a banach space as the weakly closed bounded subsets on which every bounded linear functional attains its supre mum james s proofs were technically quite demanding and there has been a considerable effort made for discovering a simpler proof 20 3 22 6 7 5 16 12 18 19 15 2 when the underlying banach space is separable elegant proofs have been given in 6 cf also 7 using simons s inequality 24 and in 5 using convexity methods the latter ones were refined in 15 to cover spaces having w sequentially compact dual balls the situation changes drastically in the non separable case where the arguments become more delicate mainly due to the fact that the w topology on bounded subsets of the dual is no longer metrizable the methods of 5 have been extended in 12 to cover the non separable case as well in 18 cf also 19 godefroy s boundary problem is answered in the affirmative yielding a new proof of james s theorem based on simon s inequality rosenthal s 1 theorem 23 and a refinement of a technique due to j hagler and w b johnson 8 for extracting 1 sequences in spaces whose duals contain 1 sequences without w convergent subsequences the proof of james s theorem given in 16 was the first one to combine the results from 24 23 and 8 we finally mention 1991 mathematics subject classification primary 46 b 03 secondary 0 e 302 key words and phrases james sup theorem the 1 theorem boundary 1 http arxiv org abs 1407 3655 v 1 2 i gasparis paper 2 where the arguments of 20 are extended to give quantitative versions of james s theorem we shall next describe the main result of this paper the starting point is the following result of d amir and j lindenstrauss 1 suppose that x is a banach space generated by a weakly compact subset k let c k denote the banach space of scalar valued functions continuous on k under the supremum norm consider the natural restriction operator r x c k given by r x x k then r is w w continuous in particular r is weakly compact we first observe that some sort of converse to the previous result holds as well indeed let k be a bounded subset of the banach space x after naturally identifying x with a closed subspace of x we set l k w and let r x c l be the natural restriction operator it is shown in corollary 3 5 that if r is weakly compact then l x and so k is relatively weakly compact now suppose k satisfies the hypotheses in the statement of james s theorem the result will follow once we manage to show that r is weakly compact let y c l and identify k with a subset of by then the restriction operator r x y satisfies the following two properties the first one is that r is w k continuous where k denotes the topology in y of point wise convergence on k the second property that r satisfies is that every vector in the range of r attains its norm at an element of k our main result states that these properties suffice to ensure that r is weakly compact more precisely we prove the following theorem theorem 1 1 let x and y be banach spaces and f by endow y with the topology f of point wise convergence on f assume that t x y is a bounded linear operator which is w f continuous assume further that for every x x there exists y f such that t x y tx then t is w w continuous the proof relies on rosenthal s 1 theorem and james s distortion theo rem 11 it does not make use of simons s inequality a key role in the proof is played by the 1 sequences a normalized sequence xn in a banach space is an 1 sequence if there is some c 0 such that n anxn c n an whenever an 1 with an 0 for all n n it is easy to see that every normalized non weakly null sequence in a banach space admits an 1 subsequence it is shown in lemma 3 2 that if xn is an 1 sequence then there exists a sequence of positive scalars bn with bn 1 and such that 1 bn n i 1 bixi n 1 i 1 bixi for all n n this result serves as a substitute to simons s inequality and enables us to prove corollary 3 3 first proved by simons through his inequality a rainwater type of result where the set of extreme points of the dual ball is replaced by any boundary of the space corollary 3 3 yields a rather elementary proof of james s theo rem for spaces having w sequentially compact dual balls these results are presented in section 3 an extension of james s compactness theorem 3 the proof of theorem 1 1 is given in section 4 we first prove lemma 4 1 a refinement of the key lemma 3 2 for sequences generating 1 almost isometrically this lemma is helpful in the study of the f admissible subsets of a banach space y where f is a symmetric subset of by a subset k of y is f admissible if it is bounded compact in the topology of point wise convergence on f and if n anyn attains its norm at an element of f for every an 1 and every sequence yn in k note that under the assump tions of theorem 1 1 t a is f admissible for every w compact subset a of x the main point about these sets is that they can not contain normal ized sequences spanning 1 almost isometrically this is shown in corollary 4 8 by combining rosenthal s 1 theorem james s distortion theorem and corollary 4 2 theorem 1 1 will then follow because t maps w compact subsets of x into weakly compact subsets of y 2 preliminaries we use standard banach space facts and terminology as may be found in 14 set t z c z 1 a subset a of a banach space is symmetric if za a for all z t let x be a banach space bx stands for the closed unit ball of x a boundary for x is a subset b of bx with the property that for every x x there exists b b such that b x b a sequence in x is called an 1 sequence if it is a basic sequence equiv alent to the usual basis of 1 a normalized sequence en in x is said to generate 1 almost isometrically if for every 0 there exists n 0 n so that n n 0 anen 1 1 n an for all an n n 0 1 if x then is said to generate 1 isometrically if for n n all choices of pairwise distinct members x 1 xn of and all choices of scalars a 1 an we have that n i 1 aixi n i 1 ai if f bx then the topology f of point wise convergence on f is a linear topology on x having as a neighborhood basis of the origin the collection of sets u g g f finite 0 where u g x x b x b g let z be a topological space and zn be a sequence in z a cluster point of zn is any limit of a convergent subnet of zn if m is an infinite subset of n then the notation m mn indicates the increasing enumeration of m m stands for the set of all infinite subsets of m we let t denote the dyadic tree n 1 0 1 n t is partially ordered by initial segment inclusion that is a 1 an b 1 bm in t precisely when n m and ai bi for all i n a branch of t is a maximal under inclusion well ordered subset a tree of infinite subsets of n is a collection m t of members of n indexed by t so that m m whenever while m m if and are incomparable 4 i gasparis 3 a proof of james s theorem in the separable case we let 1 denote the positive cone of 1 that is 1 an 1 an 0 n n definition 3 1 1 a normalized sequence en in a banach space is called an 1 sequence if there is some c 0 such that n anen c n an for all an 1 we then say that en is an c 1 sequence in case c 1 en is said to generate 1 isometrically 2 a normalized sequence en in a banach space is said to generate 1 almost isometrically if for all 0 there exists n 0 n so that en n n 0 is an 1 1 1 sequence let en be a bounded non weakly null sequence of non zero vectors in a banach space then evidently en en admits an 1 subsequence lemma 3 2 let y be a banach space and yn a normalized 1 sequence in y then there exists a sequence of positive scalars bn satisfying the following property 1 bn n i 1 biyi n 1 i 1 biyi 1 n n proof assume that yn is a c 1 sequence for some 0 c 1 we use induction on n n to construct the desired scalar sequence bn choose 0 b 1 e 1 c then 1 b 1 b 1 y 1 b 1 1 b 1 1 e 1 1 e 1 the intermediate value theorem now applied on 2 0 r with 2 t b 1 y 1 ty 2 provides us some b 2 0 such that 1 b 1 b 1 y 1 b 1 y 1 b 2 y 2 1 we next assume that n 2 and that the positive scalars b 1 bn have been chosen to satisfy 1 bk k i 1 biyi k 1 i 1 biyi 1 1 k n 1 it follows now from our inductive assumption that 1 bn n i 1 biyi b 1 n i 1 1 bi b 1 e n i 1 bi b 1 e 1 c n i 1 biyi b 1 e 1 c 1 we finally apply the intermediate value theorem for the function n 1 t n i 1 biyi tyn 1 t 0 to obtain bn 1 0 such that 1 bn n i 1 biyi n 1 i 1 biyi 1 an extension of james s compactness theorem 5 this completes the inductive step and the proof of the lemma the next result was obtained in 24 here we present an alternative proof based on our previous lemma corollary 3 3 let yn be a bounded sequence in the banach space y let f by be such that n anyn attains its norm at some element of f for all an 1 assume that limn y yn 0 for all y f then yn is weakly null proof we first observe that the hypotheses of the corollary are also fulfilled by any sequence of the form ykn ykn where ykn is any subsequence of yn which is bounded away from zero assume that yn is not weakly null our observation allows us to assume without loss of generality that yn is a normalized 1 sequence let bn be the scalar sequence resulting from lemma 3 2 applied on yn set un n i 1 biui n n then 1 bn un un 1 1 for all n n it follows that u n bnun is a well defined element of y and that u un i n 1 bi for all n n moreover un un 1 u for all n n our hypotheses yield that u attains its norm at some element of f however let y f be arbitrary and pick 0 b 1 2 choose m n so that y yn and bn 1 for all n m it follows that if we let tn u un n n then tn is strictly decreasing to 1 and 2 u 1 tn we are thus led to the following estimates y u um n m 1 bn y yn um n m 1 bn um 2 n m 1 bn 1 bn um 2 n m 1 ln 1 bn um 2 ln n m 1 1 bn um 2 ln u um 1 u tm 2 ln tm 1 u tm 2 tm 1 u 1 tm 2 u tm 1 u 1 tm tm 1 tm u contrary to our assumptions therefore yn is indeed weakly null evidently the preceding corollary readily yields simons s result 24 that every bounded sequence xn in a banach space x satisfying limn b xn 0 for all b b where b is a boundary for x is weakly null cf also 15 the case were b is the set of the extreme points of bx is the well known rainwater s theorem 21 the next lemma is due to r c james 10 cf also 17 but we include a proof to be thorough 6 i gasparis lemma 3 4 let x be a banach space and k x we naturally identify x with a closed subspace of x and assume that k w x 6 then there exist a sequence xn in k a bounded sequence x n in x and 0 so that for all n n x n xi 1 n i n yet x i xn i n proof choose x k w x the hahn banach theorem yields x x and 0 so that x x and x x 0 we use induction on n n to construct the desired sequences xn and x n we first apply goldstine s theorem to obtain x 1 x with x 1 x so that x x 1 we then choose x 1 k so that x 1 x 1 we next assume that n 2 and that xi n 1 i 1 k x i n 1 i 1 x have been chosen so that 1 x i x x i xj 1 i j i i n 1 2 x j xi j i n 1 3 x x i i n 1 since x vanishes on x and x x goldstine s theorem gives us some x n x such that x n x x xn and x n xj 1 n for all j n therefore x x i for all i n on the other hand x k w and so we may choose xn k such that x i xn for all i n it follows now that xi n i 1 and x i n i 1 satisfy 1 3 for n the inductive step and the proof of the lemma are now complete remark 1 the preceding lemma yields the less direct implication of the eberlein smulian theorem indeed assume that k is a relatively weakly countably compact subset of a banach spacex to prove thatk is relatively weakly compact it suffices showing thatk w x assume the contrary and choose sequences xn k x n x and 0 according to lemma 3 4 let x x be a w cluster point of x n and let x x be a weak cluster point of xn it follows that x xi 0 for all i n and thus x x 0 on the other hand x i x for all i n whence x x a contradiction corollary 3 5 let k be a bounded subset of the banach space x we naturally identify x with a closed subspace of x and set l k w let r x c l be the natural restriction operator if r is weakly compact then k is relatively weakly compact proof note first that since k is bounded l is w compact we need only show that l x if that were not the case then lemma 3 4 yields bounded sequences xn k x n x and 0 so that for all n n x n xi 1 n i n yet x i xn i n let fn r x n for all n n r is weakly compact and so fn admits a weak cluster point f c l thanks to the eberlein smulian theorem it follows by the first inequality above that f xi 0 for all i n on the an extension of james s compactness theorem 7 other hand let x l be a w cluster point of xn then f x 0 however the second inequality above yields fi x for all i n hence f x which is a contradiction the next corollary is a special case of james s compactness theorem cf also 15 corollary 3 6 let x be a banach space whose dual ball is w sequentially compact let k x be bounded with the property that every x x attains its supremum on k then k is relatively weakly compact proof x is naturally identified with a closed subspace ofx set l k w since k is bounded l is w compact let y c l endowed with the supremum norm and consider the natural restriction operator r x y corollary 3 5 will lead the assertion provided we show that r is weakly compact to this end let x n be a bounded sequence in x since x has a w sequentially compact dual ball we may assume without loss of generality that x n is w convergent to some x x we set f r x and fn r x n for all n n it follows that fn f is a bounded sequence in y satisfying limn fn t f t for all t k note also that for all an 1 n an fn f supx l n anx x n x supx k n an x n x x and the latter is attained at an element of k thanks to our hypothesis we infer from corollary 3 3 that fn is weakly convergent to f and therefore r is indeed weakly compact by the eberlein smulian theorem 4 proof of the main result lemma 4 1 let y be a banach space and yn a normalized sequence in y generating 1 almost isometrically let 0 0 1 there exist positive integers m 0 n 0 and a sequence of positive scalars bn so that letting zn ym 0 n n n the following hold 1 n 0 n 1 bnzn 0 2 1 bn n i 1 bizi n 1 i 1 bizi 1 n n 0 3 i n 1 bi n i 1 bizi i 1 bizi 1 n n 0 proof we first choose 0 1 0 such that 0 e 1 1 2 0 1 this is possible because 0 e 1 0 1 since yn generates 1 almost isometrically there exists m 0 n such that i m 0 aiyi 1 1 i m 0 ai ai i m 0 1 we next choose n 0 n such that 1 n 0 and set v 0 1 n 0 n 0 i 1 zi note that v 0 1 1 define bi 0 n 0 v 0 i n 0 and un 0 n 0 i 1 bizi then un 0 0 and 0 bi i n 0 observe that 1 bn 0 un 0 1 0 e 0 0 e 1 0 1 8 i gasparis we now apply the intermediate value theorem in a manner similar to that in the proof of lemma 3 2 to obtain bn 0 1 0 such that 1 bn 0 un 0 un 0 bn 0 1 zn 0 1 1 we next assume that n n 0 1 and that we have constructed positive scalars bi n i n 0 1 satisfying 1 bk k i 1 bizi k 1 i 1 bizi 1 n 0 k n 1 then 1 bn n i 1 bizi n i n 0 1 bi n 0 i 1 bizi 0 e n i n 0 bi 0 e 1 n i n 0 bizi we now observe that n 0 1 i 1 bizi n i n 0 bizi n i 1 bi 1 n i 1 bizi 1 and that n 0 1 i 1 bizi n 0 i 1 bizi bn 0 0 hence n i n 0 bizi 1 0 1 2 0 we conclude that 1 bn n i 1 bizi 0 e 1 1 2 0 1 once again the intermediate value theorem yields some bn 1 0 so that 1 bn n i 1 bizi n 1 i 1 bizi 1 we have thus inductively constructed a sequence of positive scalars bn satisfying 1 and 2 it follows that n bn is a convergent series and hence 3 is an immediate consequence of 2 corollary 4 2 let yn be a normalized sequence in the banach space y generating 1 almost isometrically let f by be such that n anyn attains its norm at some element of f for all an 1 then for all 0 1 there exists y f such that lim supn y yn moreover if every subsequence of yn admits a f cluster point which attains its norm at some element of f then there exists y f such that lim supn y yn 1 an extension of james s compactness theorem 9 proof assume to the contrary that for some 0 1 we had that lim supn y yn for all y f choose 0 0 1 and 0 0 so that 0 1 0 apply lemma 4 1 to find n 0 n a sequence of positive scalars bn and a subsequence zn of yn so that n 0 i 1 bizi 0 and 1 bn n i 1 bizi n 1 i 1 bizi 1 n n 0 we set un n i 1 bizi for all n n and u n bnzn then 1 bn un un 1 and i n 1 bi un u n n 0 in particular un un 1 u for all n n 0 so if we let tn u un we obtain that tn n n 0 is strictly decreasing to 1 let y f be arbitrary and choose m n 0 so that y zn and bn 0 for all n m we now have the following estimates y u um n m 1 bn y zn um n m 1 bn um 1 0 n m 1 bn 1 0 um 1 0 n m 1 bn 1 bn um 1 0 n m 1 ln 1 bn um 1 0 ln n m 1 1 bn um 1 0 ln u um 1 u tm 1 0 ln tm 1 u tm 1 0 tm 1 u 1 tm 1 0 u tm 1 u 1 tm 0 u tm 1 u 1 tm un 0 u tm 1 u 1 tm um u tm 1 u 1 tm tm 1 tm u therefore y u u for all y f contradicting our hypothesis that u attains its norm at some element of f for the moreover assertion let us suppose that lim supn y yn 1 for all y f it follows that y y 1 for all y f and every f cluster point y of yn we deduce from this and our hypothesis that y 1 for every f cluster point y of yn that attains its norm at some element of f successive applications of the first part of this corollary now yield a nested 10 i gasparis sequence m 1 m 2 of infinite subsets of n and a sequence y n f so that 4 1 y n yi 1 1 n i mn n n we next choose integers m 1 m 2 with mn mn for all n n our hypothesis now yields a f cluster point y 0 of ymn which attains its norm at some element of f therefore y 0 1 by our comments in the beginning of this paragraph however 4 1 implies that y 0 1 this contradiction completes the proof of the lemma definition 4 3 let y be a banach space and f by a subset k of y is said to be f admissible if k is bounded f compact and whenever zn k and an 1 then n anzn attains its norm at some element of f lemma 4 4 let y be a banach space f by and let k y be f admissible let yn k and let in be a sequence of finite subsets of n of the same cardinality let n be a bounded sequence of scalars and set un i in iyi for all n n assume that un is normalized and generates 1 almost isometrically then there exists y f such that lim supn y un 1 proof it is not hard to see that the f admissibility of k implies that n anun attains its norm at an element of f for every an 1 there fore in view of corollary 4 2 it suffices showing that every subsequence of un admits a f cluster point which attains its norm at some element of f note also that our assumptions on un are also satisfied by any of its subsequences thus we need only establish our assertion for un solely to this end let d n be such that in d for all n n let us denote by m n i the i th element of in for all n n and i d since n is bounded by passing to a subsequence of un if necessary there is no loss of generality in assuming that limn m n i i c for all i d since k is f compact k d is compact in the product topology induced by f define yn ym n i d i 1 for all n n and choose a cluster point zi d i 1 k d of yn clearly d i 1 izi is a f cluster point of un which attains its norm at some element of f in the sequel we shall make use of the following simple observation sup pose that en is a sequence in a banach space isometrically equivalent to the 1 basis let d n m 1 md in n and non zero scalars i d 1 i 1 with d 1 i 1 i 1 define un d i 1 iemi d 1 en for all n md then un n md generates 1 isometrically lemma 4 5 let y be a banach space f a symmetric subset of by and let k y be f admissible then k contains no sequence isometrically equivalent to the 1 basis an extension of james s compactness theorem 11 proof assume to the contrary that yn is a normalized sequence isomet rically equivalent to the 1 basis notice that 1 2 y 1 1 2 yn n 2 generates 1 isometrically since f is symmetric lemma 4 4 yields m 1 n minm 1 1 and y 1 f so that limn m 1 y 1 1 2 y 1 1 2 yn 1 set m 1 1 and m 2 minm 1 then 1 4 ym 1 1 4 ym 2 1 2 yn n m 2 m 2 generates 1 isomet rically so we choose by lemma 4 4 and the symmetry of f y 2 f and m 2 m 1 m 2 so that limn m 2 y 2 1 4 ym 1 1 4 ym 2 1 2 yn 1 continuing in this manner we inductively construct a nested sequence m 1 m 2 of infinite subsets of n so that letting mn minmn 1 n 2 then mn mn and there exists y n f so that lim k mn y n n i 1 1 2 n ymi 1 2 yk 1 n n let y 0 k be a f cluster point of ymn observe that y n 1 2 ymi 1 2 y 0 1 for all i n and n n it follows from this that 1 2 ymn 1 2 y 0 n 1 generates 1 isometrically finally let an be any sequence of positive scalars such that n an 1 we infer from our assumptions that n an 1 2 ymn 1 2 y 0 attains its norm at some element of f since f is symmetric there exists z f so that n anz 1 2 ymn 1 2 y 0 1 whence z ymn z y 0 2 for all n n but this contradicts the fact that y 0 is a f cluster point of ymn lemma 4 6 let y be a banach space f a symmetric subset of by and let k y be f admissible assume that yn is a normalized sequence in k generating 1 almost isometrically then given r n t finite and a collection ni r i 1 of pairwise disjoint members of n there exists a collection pi r i 1 with pi ni for all i r satisfying the following property for every choice 1 r of members of there exists y f so that limk pi y yk i for all i r proof fix 1 r in it is sufficient to findmi ni i r and y 0 f so that limk mi y 0 yk i for all i r since r is finite by repeating this process a finite number of times we shall arrive at the desired choices of p 1 pr we first choose a sequence i 1 i 2 of successive finite subsets of n of the form ij lj 1 ljr where lji ni for all i r and j n we define vk r i 1 iylki and uk vk vk for all k n since yk generates 1 almost isometrically by passing to a subsequence of vk if necessary there is no loss of generality in assuming that limk vk r for the same reason we may also assume that uk generates 1 almost isometrically it is clear that uk fulfills the hypotheses in lemma 4 4 and hence there exists y 1 f so that lim supk y 1 uk 1 once again by passing to a subsequence of uk if necessary we may assume that limk y 1 uk 1 and that limk y 1 ylki ai c for all i r it follows now that r i 1 ai i r we deduce from this and the fact that ai i 1 for all i r that there is some z t such that ai i z for 12 i gasparis all i r set mi lki k n for all i r and y 0 zy 1 since f is symmetric y 0 f and it is clear that limk mi y 0 yk i for all i r lemma 4 7 let y be a banach space f a symmetric subset of by and let k y be f admissible assume that yn is a normalized sequence in k generating 1 almost isometrically then there exists a subset of k of cardinality equal to the continuum whose elements are f cluster points of yn generating 1 c isometrically proof let n be a scalar sequence strictly decreasing to 0 and choose an increasing sequence 1 2 of finite subsets of t such that n is an n net for t for all n n successive applications of lemma 4 6 yield a tree m t of infinite subsets of n with the following property for each n n and all choices z 0 1 n of elements from n there exists y f so that limk m y yk z for all 0 1 n let b 1 2 be a branch of t let nb n be almost contained in each m j i e nb m j is finite for all j n let yb k be a f cluster point of yn n nb if b denotes the set of all branches of t then we claim that yb b b generates 1 c isometrically indeed suppose that m n and that b 1 bm are distinct branches of t write bi i 1 i 2 i m given p n choose an integer n 0 p so that i n 0 6 j n 0 whenever i 6 j in 1 m let ai m i 1 be scalars and write ai ai zi with zi t for all i m we then choose for all i m i n 0 so that i zi n 0 our construction yields y f such that limk m in 0 y yk i for all i m it follows that limk n bi y yk i for all i m and therefore y ybi i for all i m we infer now from the f admissibility of k that ybi 1 for all i m finally we have the estimates m i 1 aiybi m i 1 aiy ybi m i 1 ai i m i 1 aizi m i 1 ai zi i m i 1 ai m i 1 ai n 0 1 p m i 1 ai since p n is arbitrary and limn n 0 we conclude that m i 1 aiybi m i 1 ai for every m n and all choices of scalars ai m i 1 hence yb b b generates 1 c isometrically corollary 4 8 let y be a banach space f a symmetric subset of by and let k y be f admissible suppose that z is a closed linear subspace of y isomorphic to 1 then bz k 6 proof let us assume that bz k james s distortion theorem 11 now yields a normalized sequence yn in k generating 1 almost isometrically an extension of james s compactness theorem 13 we deduce from lemma 4 7 that k contains a normalized sequence isomet rically equivalent to the 1 basis contradicting lemma 4 5 proof of theorem 1 1 there is no loss of generality in assuming that f is symmetric suppose that x n is a bounded sequence in x such that tx n is equivalent to the 1 basis it follows that x n is also equivalent to the 1 basis let z denote the closed linear subspace of y generated by tx n it is clear now that there exists a closed ball b x centered at the origin so that bz tb but t is w f continuous and so k tb is f compact k is also bounded because t is since every vector in the range of t attains its norm at an element of f we obtain that k is f admissible however z is isomorphic to 1 and bz k contradicting corollary 4 8 we infer from the above that for every bounded sequence x n in x tx n admits no 1 subsequence rosenthal s 1 theorem 23 now yields a weak cauchy subsequence tx kn of tx n let x 0 x be a w cluster point of x kn the w f continuity of t implies that tx 0 is a f cluster point of tx kn since the latter sequence is weak cauchy it fol lows that limn y tx kn y tx 0 for all y f on the other hand n an tx kn tx 0 im t for all an 1 and therefore we deduce from our assumptions on t that it attains its norm at an element of f corollary 3 3 now yields that tx kn is weakly convergent to tx 0 we conclude from the eberlein smulian theorem that t maps w compact subsets of x to weakly compact subsets of y in particular t is weakly compact we next show that t is w w continuous to this end we first claim that if v y is norm closed and convex then t 1 v is a w closed subset of x indeed t 1 v is convex and thus by the krein smulian theorem for the w topology 13 cf also 4 it suffices showing that u t 1 v is w closed for every closed ball u in x centered at the origin so let u be a net in u t 1 v w converging to some u x clearly u u and so we need to show that tu v we deduce from the first part of the proof that tu is a weakly compact subset of y therefore there is no loss of generality by passing to a subnet if necessary to assume that tu weakly converges to some y 0 tu since v is weakly closed by mazur s theorem we obtain that y 0 v tu note that tu f converges to tu as t is w f continuous it follows that y tu y y 0 for all y f note also that f separates points in im t since both tu and y 0 belong to tu we are led to the identity tu y 0 v which proves our claim we next claim that if x is a net in x w converging to the origin then tx is weakly converging to the origin in y were this false we would find z y 0 and a subnet tx m of tx so that z tx for all m without loss of generality by replacing z by z for a suitable t and passing to a further subnet if necessary we may assume that tx v 0 for all m where we have set v 0 y y re z y 2 it is clear that v 0 is a norm closed and convex subset 14 i gasparis of y and hence our initial claim yields that t 1 v 0 is a w closed subset of x containing the subnet x m however this subnet is w convergent to the origin of x and thus v 0 contains the origin of y which is absurd thus our claim holds and so t is indeed w w continuous corollary 4 9 james s compactness theorem let x be a banach space and let k x be bounded assume that every x x attains its supremum on k then k is relatively weakly compact proof we naturally identify x with a closed subspace of x and set l k w let r x c l be the natural restriction operator let f x x k where x stands for the dirac measure at x k clearly r is w f continuous our assumptions on k imply that every vector in the range of r attains its norm at an element of f we deduce from theorem 1 1 that r is weakly compact and hence k is relatively weakly compact by corollary 3 5 references 1 d amir and j lindenstrauss the
