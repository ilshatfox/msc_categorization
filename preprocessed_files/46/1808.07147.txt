helmut hofer introduction background the following material has been compiled for the sft 9 workshop in augsburg germany taking place monday 27 august 2018 friday 31 august 2018 the necessary background material will be provided in a pre course saturday 25 august 2018 sunday 26 august 2018 for those not able to participate in the pre course we shall give references to the assumed material particularly we mention the primer 22 the local local constructions 23 and the appendices in the present text this present text describes a polyfold approach to the construction of symplectic field theory sft introduced in 14 based on the technology developed in 52 and 24 the present draft is a shortened version of the upcoming lecture note 25 which will provide more details and will among other things construct sft in detail in the current text we end by giving the perturbation and transversality results needed a reader familiar with 14 6 84 should be able to work out the orientations and using the fact that the pull back of differential forms by the evaluation maps are sc differential forms integrate them over the moduli spaces see 52 the material presented here then leads to a construction of a hamiltonian hp in the context of a given closed manifold q equipped with a non degenerate contact form associated to a careful choice of perturbation p and how these are related for different choices of the perturbations the transversality methods described here cover also the cases which we have not explicitly studied in the lecture series namely the behavior under symplectic cobordisms their compositions as well as the change of complex multiplication j polyfold theory by itself has nothing to do with symplectic geometry it is rather a mixture of a generalized differential geometry a generalization of classical nonlin ear fredholm theory and some category theory this theory has been developed by hofer wysocki and zehnder in a series of papers 46 47 48 subsequently the theory was further generalized and a comprehensive treatment is contained in 52 which is a reference monograph on which further developments rest in 51 the the ory was applied to derive gromov witten theory an application which was more a proof of concept in 51 the authors did not try to utilize some of the important features of the polyfold theory namely that one can use the language to construct powerful methods and tools for the construction of concrete polyfolds these ideas have been developed in the upcoming monograph 24 the available references 22 23 contain part one and two of 24 again 24 is primarily not a book about symplectic geometry but it explains the ideas using examples arising from analytical problems in symplectic geometry one of the ideas put forward and carried out is the development of a modular theory which allows to recycle constructions this is an extremely important point in applications given the fact that the constructions polyfolds and sft 7 get longer and longer and are becoming increasingly difficult to check the modu lar features also include a pre fredhom theory which in applications considerably simplifies the task of showing that a sc smooth section is sc fredholm we shall not discuss this important point in this lecture but it will feature prominently in 24 in these lectures we shall show how a very complicated nonlinear problem arising in symplectic geometry can be dealt with quite efficiently using the results in 24 52 takes care of the basic analytical problems so that one can concentrate without distraction on the transversality theory the study of moduli spaces and ultimately the construction of sft in particular the nonlinear functional analysis nonlinear analysis in 52 24 can be used in applications to address problems by general principles rather than ad hoc methods this will shorten proofs and adds to the clarity in the current text we shall particularly describe the big picture and the modular aspects of the theory there are other methods which have been developed to study moduli spaces in symplectic geometry they all originate in the underlying idea of finite dimensional reductions put forward in the original work 27 by fukaya and ono we particularly mention 28 29 68 69 70 and 32 33 34 these ideas have been used sometimes in a modified way to deal with problems in symplectic geometry see the work 30 31 72 73 5 and very recently 61 in some sense the theory of kuranshi structures and polyfold theory are equivalent as studied in detail in 86 87 88 89 this means that in many cases ideas in one theory can be transported to the other we also would like to mention that the polyfold theory goes well with geometric perturbation methods as in 57 58 85 this means that one is able to stay within the framework of geometric perturbations as long as these methods work before switching to more general perturbations sft is an example which shows that the perturbation theory has to use special geometric features and this will be discussed later on the thrust of the current lectures lies on the transversality and perturbation theory we shall refer to 52 as the polyfold book and to 24 as the construction book the polyfold book is about developing an abstract non linear functional analysis and the construction book is about using that non linear functional anal ysis to build specific concrete function spaces in a modular way which are very useful for moduli problems in symplectic field theory remarks by the second author finally two important remarks the first is about multisections which are important in both approaches and originate in 27 it is a non trivial matter to extend multisections defined on a boundary with corners and the difficulties are described and dealt with in the polyfold framework in 52 and in a form more useful in inductive constructions in 43 in the work by fukaya 8 joel w fish and helmut hofer et al 29 part ii it is said without comment that they extend see after lemma 7 2 121 which one might consider a gap since a proof is considerably involved even in later works this point is not addressed until the paper 34 where a method is described which is only applicable to certain type of multisections fukaya refers to this method as the collar method this method used in an application requires one to show that one can work with these special sections in a recent email exchange of fukaya with the second author henceforth hh 35 fukaya describes a different way to deal with the issue which turns out to address the issues in a way similar to the approach used in 52 and 43 albeit in a somewhat different language dusa mcduff also has a method and hh almost expects that it is is also related in 61 ishikawa introduces a somewhat more structured version of multisections called grouped multisections which is geared towards his constructions the ver sion given in 61 v 1 has an incomplete list of requirements as hh pointed out to the author but this particular problem already has been rectified in v 2 since the lectures besides explaining many aspects of the polyfold theory also deal with the transversality issues of sft a word she be provided about 61 by hh it seems at first glance that the issues which have to be addressed are indeed discussed of course the details have to be carefully checked although the approach to sft in 61 and the approach given here are quite different there is a common thread given by the issues to be addressed we shall point out these issues and the reader might find it helpful when reading 61 the lectures and their prerequisites we have added some useful material as appendices and give some reference to other used material for the initial lectures we list some of required background material moreover the lecture not contains somewhat more material than can be delivered in lecture usually the material is needed in a later but not the next lec ture we expect the reader to familiar with the additional material when it is needed lecture 1 requires the knowledge from the primer on polyfolds see 22 pages 8 23 comprehensive background material about polyfold structures on groupoidal categories can be found in 52 lecture 2 requires some of the material on dm theory see 51 pages 11 28 41 and appendix 17 the cited references take material from the upcoming 42 which develops dm theory in such a way that it fits with the polyfold theory polyfolds and sft 9 lecture 3 requires some basic facts on stable hamiltonian structures see 9 or appendix 18 lecture 4 requires some basic facts on m polyfolds see 22 a more comprehensive background is given in 52 lecture 5 requires some basic facts on m polyfolds and covers material from 22 lecture 6 7 and 8 require some basic facts on m polyfolds and the imprinting method introduced in lecture 5 for background material see 22 a detailed discussion is contained in 24 10 joel w fish and helmut hofer part 1 big picture we begin by describing the general set up for constructing the moduli spaces of sft lecture 1 1 smooth structures on certain categories we describe a categorical framework which we shall apply to the category of stable maps as they occur in symplectic field theory here a stable map is not necessarily pseudoholomorphic the original idea of a stable pseudoholomorphic map or curve evolved from the work of gromov 37 and was formulated by kontsevich 62 the appropriate notion for symplectic field theory was given in 14 and its compactness properties were studied in 7 we start with some abstract notions which are not too difficult 1 1 gct s the notions introduced in this and the following subsections are treated in detail in 52 we shall consider groupoidal categories c which are defined as fol lows definition 1 1 a groupoidal category c is a category with the following prop erties 1 every morphism is an isomorphism 2 between any two objects there are only finitely many morphisms 3 the orbit space c i e the collection of isomorphism classes is a set further the objects we shall consider are what we call gct s gc groupoidal category t topology definition 1 2 a gct is a pair c t where c is a groupoidal category and t a metrizable topology on the orbit space c given a gct c t we can talk about objects in the category whose isomorphism classes are close to a given isomorphism class using polyfold theory we can introduce the notion of some kind of smooth structure on a gct 1 2 uniformizers denote by m the category whose objects are m polyfolds and the morphisms are the sc smooth maps by mtame we denote the full subcategory of tame m polyfolds let o be a m polyfold and g a finite group acting on o by sc diffeomorphisms written as g o o g o g o polyfolds and sft 11 associated to o g we have the translation groupoid which is the category denoted by gno its objects are the points o o and the morphisms are the pairs g o viewed as morphisms o g o g o the following generalizes some ideas which also occur when studying orbifolds definition 1 3 given a gct c t a local uniformizer at the object with automorphism group g is a covariant functor g n o c with the following properties 1 o is a m polyfold and g acts by sc diffeomorphisms and gn o is the asso ciated translation groupoid 2 the functor is injective on objects and lies in the image i e there is a unique o o with o 3 the functor is full and faithful 4 passing to orbit spaces gno c is a homeomorphism onto an open neighborhood of here denotes the isomorphism class of the object a tame uniformizer is a uniformizer where o is a tame m polyfold the first crucial definition is that of a local uniformizer construction definition 1 4 a local uniformizer construction is a functor f c set such that f is a set of uniformizers at we call f a tame local unifomizer construction provided for every the set f consists of tame uniformizers 1 3 compatibility assume we are given c t f where c t is a gct and f c set a local uniformizer construction compatibility of the various requires an additional construction m given f and f consider gno c g no the associated weak fibered product is the set m o o o o o o morc o o definition 1 5 we have the following structural maps for coming from f 1 o s m t o source map and target map i e s o o o t o o o 2 u o m o o 1 o o unit map 3 m m o o o 1 o inversion maps 4 m m s tm m multiplication map defined by m o o o o o o 12 joel w fish and helmut hofer we call m a transition set now comes the second important construction given c t f definition 1 6 a transition construction m for c t f is a construction which equips every m with a m polyfold structure so that s and t are local sc diffeomorphisms and all other structure maps are sc smooth then c t f m is called a polyfold structure on the gct c t if f is a tame local uniformizer construction we call c t f m a tame polyfold structure 1 4 bundle structure denote by ban the category of banach spaces assume we are given a gct c and a functor c ban and assume we can define a new gct e where the objects are e e and the morphisms are of the form e s e t e then we obtain p e c we can introduce the notion of a strong bundle uniformizers which is given by a diagram gnk e y p y gno c where is fiberwise a linear bijection all the previous discussions can be extended for example a transition construction produces strong bundle structure on m m structure maps fit into diagrams like this k s m t k p y p y p y o s m t o the idea of a polyfold structure on c can be generalized as follows assume we are given a polyfold construction for the gct c t say c t f m and a functor c ban defining e we assume that the latter has been equipped with a metrizable topology so that it is turned into a gct as well for which the map p e c is continuous then a strong bundle uniformizer construction is a functor f c set associating to a set f of strong bundle uniformizers polyfolds and sft 13 gnk e with the obvious properties similarly we have a notion of a transition construction having the strong bundle structure for p e c one can introduce new smooth objects definition 1 7 consider a section functor a of p i e a functor a c e with p a id we can distinguish several classes of such functors 1 a is a sc smooth section functor provided for f the local repre sentation 1 a is sc smooth 2 a is a sc smooth section functor provided for f the local repre sentation 1 a is sc smooth 2 a is a sc fredholm functor provided for f the local representation 1 a is sc fredholm the take away from this first lecture is that for groupoidal categories c which have an orbit space equipped with a metrizable topology there is a notion of a smooth structure i e a polyfold structure and there is a strong bundle version as well k s m t k p y p y p y o s m t o m y m our goal is to apply this to the category of stable maps s the bundle of 0 1 forms along them ej s and j given the gct c t every local uniformizer has a footprint which is the open subset o of c we can take a set of uniformizers such that the footprints cover c we can take the disjoint union of all domains defining a m polyfold x and one can use the m to defined as a disjoint union a m polyfold x then x x x is an ep groupoid and there is natural functor x c which is an equivalence of categories in some sense x is a sc smooth model of c for two different choices there is a precise relationship between the associated x for certain constructions these smooth models are useful see 52 14 joel w fish and helmut hofer lecture 2 2 the category of stable riemann surfaces this example deals with a version of the deligne mumford theory 12 for a geometric approach to the dm theory see 74 for the use of the dm theory within the later constructions it is important that we can use different gluing profiles see 51 we assume the reader to be familiar with some riemann surface theory see 51 41 and appendix 17 2 1 basic notions and concepts first we introduce the notion of a compact nodal riemann surface with unordered marked points definition 2 1 consider a tuple s j m d where s j is a compact riemann surface possibly having different connected components m is a finite subset of so called marked points and d is a finite collection of unordered pairs x y called nodal pairs where x y s we abbreviate the union x y d x y by d we assume that the data satisfies the following additional properties for x y d we have that x 6 y if x y x y 6 then x y x y m d we call s j md a nodal riemann surface with marked points we allow of course the possibility d and m we say that s j m d is stable if for every connected component c of s the genus gc of c satisfies the inequality 2 gc c m d 3 we generally assume that the set of marked points is un ordered figure 1 a stable riemann surface with two nodal pairs and three marked points polyfolds and sft 15 given s j m d and s j m d we define a morphism as a tuple where s j s j is a biholomorphic map having the following properties m m d d where d x y x y d finally we are able to define the category of stable riemann surfaces definition 2 2 the category r of stable riemann surfaces has as objects the nodal stable riemann surfaces with marked points and as morphisms the previously introduced we observe that every morphism is in fact an isomorphism it requires more work to show that between two objects there are at most finitely morphisms in fact the orbit space r even has a natural metrizable topology hence theorem 2 3 the category r admits a natural metrizable topology t and r t is a gct for this topology every connected component of r is compact this can be proved with the results presented in 55 a proof will be given in 42 and there is also a discussion in 40 51 2 2 good deformations a version of deligne mumford theory can be obtained in the framework of uniformizers as follows where we need the following definition definition 2 4 let s j m d be a stable riemann surface with automor phism group g a small disk structure d for consists of a choice of a smooth closed disk like neighborhood dx for every x d such that dx d m x dx dy for x 6 y x d dx is invariant under g we need to introduce the complex vector space h 1 obtained as follows recall that the cauchy riemann operator can be defined on the complex vector space 0 consisting of smooth section u of ts s which vanish at the nodal points and the points in m so that u is a ts valued 0 1 form i e u z tzs tzs is complex anti linear for every z denote by 0 1 the complex vector space of such 0 1 forms then 0 0 1 is a complex linear injective operator with finite dimensional cokernel we define h 1 0 1 0 this is a complex vector space of dimension 3 ga 3 m d where ga is the arithmetic genus defined by ga 1 d c g c 1 16 joel w fish and helmut hofer figure 2 a stable riemann surface and adding a small disk structure definition 2 5 let be an object in r with automorphism group g and assume that a small disk structure d has been fixed a good deformation j for with given d consists of a g invariant open neighborhood v of 0 h 1 and a smooth family v 3 v j v of almost complex structures on s so that the following holds 1 j 0 j 2 j v j on all dx for x d and v v 3 dj v h 1 h 1 v is a complex linear isomorphism for every v v 4 for every g g and v v the map g v g v is biholomorphic it is a known fact that for given and small disk structure a good deformation always exists 2 3 uniformizers for r fix a good deformation j for and d then we can define for a natural gluing parameter a b and v v the objects v a by v a sa j v a ma da on v b we have the natural action of g by diffeomorphisms defining us the translation groupoid gn v b we also obtain a functor gn v b r 1 which on objects maps v a v a and on morphisms g v a v a ga g v g a polyfolds and sft 17 the following theorem is well known and a consequence of standard dm theory and holds for every gluing profile theorem 2 6 the orbit space r has a natural metrizable topology for which every connected component is compact moreover the following holds which also charac terizes the topology let d and j as described above and let be the associated functor defined in 1 then there exists a g invariant open neighborhood o of 0 0 in h 1 b such that the following holds 1 gno r is fully faithful and injective on objects and 0 0 2 the map gn o r induced between orbit spaces defines a homeo morphism onto an open neighborhood of 3 for every v a the kodaira spencer differential associated to v a is an iso morphism we note that on objects 0 0 and on morphisms g 0 0 g this is the point where the current topic connects with the topic discussed in lecture 1 as described in the polyfold theory for groupoidal category a method to explore the richness of such a category is the construction of uniformizers the functors we just introduced give a natural uniformizer construction for r we just mention there are also natural constructions of a similar kind for the category of stable maps in gromov witten theory 40 and which is the topic of this text also for sft in view of theorem 2 6 we can make the following definition definition 2 7 let be an object in r with automorphism group g we say that gno r is a good uniformizer associated to if it is obtained after a choice of small disk structure d and deformation j as a restriction satisfying the properties 1 3 given there is a set of choices we can make resulting in a set of associated uniformizers denoted by f if is a morphism it is clear that there is a 1 1 correspondence between the choices for and respectively hence we obtain a natural bijection f f f this defines a functor fdm r set associating to an object a set of good uniformizers having in the image as was already said the above construction works for every gluing profile however if we would like to have a smooth transition between two uniformizers we have to be careful in the choice of the gluing profile in fact the gluing profile r 1 2 ln r gives a construction which is equivalent to the classical dm theory however this gluing 18 joel w fish and helmut hofer profile is not as useful for sft if we use the exponential gluing profile r e 1 r e we loose the holomorphicity but otherwise the associated dm theory has the same features and the methods extend to sft these details are described in 42 the following is a very important result theorem 2 8 let be the exponential gluing profile associated to r t f dm there is a transition construction m dm where each m dm is equipped with a smooth manifold structure 2 4 more on dm theory we shall describe some results in the dm context which we shall use later when we discuss in lecture 3 buildings of stable maps we have to consider their underlying domains what we shall obtain is the following data for each i 0 k a tuple i i si ji mi di i and for i 1 k a bijection bi i 1 i the points in mi are called marked points the points in i positive and negative punctures in general the i are not stable they come however with decompositions si s tc i t sntci where snti is a finite union of simply connected closed riemann surfaces containing no point from mi and containing pre cisely one point from i and i however not every connected component having the latter property belongs to stc in addition we are given a finite group g acting by biholomorphic maps preserving the floors i e g 0 g k such that for z i 1 we have that bi i 1 z i bi z in addition i stci stci and i sntci sntci given this data we shall add so called stabilization points as we shall see later on they have to be picked carefully and are also associated to other data transver sal constraints which will be introduced later the set of stabilization points is assumed to be invariant under the g action after adding the stabilization points it is assumed that each domain component together with all the special points on it becomes stable consider which consists of the riemann surface s j the marked points m 0 t k tm t where are the stabilization points we denote by d the union of the di and all z bi z where i 1 k and z i 1 then s j m d is a stable riemann surface with automorphism group g containing g we shall refer to as the associated dm data there is a natural action of g on h 1 this finite dimensional complex vector space splits naturally according to the partition of s into s stc 0 s ntc 0 s tc k s ntc k and the action by g preserves this splitting this is generally not the case for the g action we obtain the natural identification h 1 h 1 tc 0 h 1 ntc 0 h 1 tck h 1 ntck 2 v vtc 0 vntc 0 vtck v ntc k polyfolds and sft 19 trivial cylinder segements nodal pair negative punctures positive punctures floor 0 floor 1 floor 2 trivial cylinder segements nodal pair negative punctures positive punctures floor 0 floor 1 floor 2 figure 3 a riemann surface building with three floors with and without stabilization points added here tci is s tc i equipped with the special points coming from m and d and similarly for ntci we have a natural action of g on h 1 tc 0 h 1 ntc 0 h 1 tck h 1 ntck in view of 2 whose restriction to g has a diagonal form with respect to the indicated decomposition definition 2 9 we assume we started with 0 b 1 bk k were i and bi are as described before equipped with the action of a finite group g by biholomorphic maps preserving the floors i and the other data after fixing a g invariant stabiliza tion set we denote the associated dm data by assume we have picked the small disk structure d so that the union of disks is invariant under g where g and g act in the way as just described a good adapted deformation of j consists of an open g invariant neighborhood v of 0 h 1 tc 0 h 1 ntc 0 h 1 tck h 1 ntck and a family j v 3 v j v of almost complex structures on so that the following properties hold 1 for v v it holds that j v stci jstci v tc i and j v sntci jsntci v ntc i where v decomposes into the direct sum of the vtci and v ntc i 2 for all g g the map g s j v m d s j g v m d is biholomor phic 20 joel w fish and helmut hofer 3 j 0 j and for v v it holds j v j on the disks of the small disk structure d 4 for every v v the kodaira spencer differential dj v h 1 h 1 v is a complex linear isomorphism where v s j v m d moreover the map v 3 v j v is injective 5 the map v v defines a good uniformizer for the dm spaces of fixed nodal type more precisely denoting by the nodal type of g n v r where on objects v v and on morphisms g v v g g v is a good uniformizer herer has its orbit space equipped with the topology coming from the one on the orbit space of r the nodal type of a stable riemann surface in r is obtained as follows starting with s j m d we first produce a decorated graph where we take a vertex v v c for every domain component c of s which we label with its genus g v g c and the number of marked points m v m c on c for every nodal pair x y d we have that x c and y c where c c is a possibility and we draw an edge connecting the vertices associated to c and c the stability of is equivalent to the statement that for every vertex v the edge number e v satisfies the inequality 2 g v m v e v 3 there is an obvious notion of isomorphism for two such decorated graphs by defi nition the nodal type of is the isomorphism class of the associated decorated graph we need the following result theorem 2 10 given the dm data associated and the auxiliary structure there exists for given small disk structure d as previously described a good deformation j 2 5 further concepts finally we would like to introduce the category r its objects are closed stable riemann surfaces with an ordered set of marked points i e m m 1 m 2 m then such a stable riemann surface takes the form s j m d a morphism is a tuple where s j s j is a biholomorphic map satisfying d d and m m here m m 1 m we have a forgetful functor f r r polyfolds and sft 21 which on objects maps s j m d to s j m d where m is the set of un ordered marked points underlying m the morphism is mapped to the forgetful functors is an example of a proper covering functor and they will occur quite frequently below we give the general definition definition 2 11 let c c a functor between groupoidal categories we say is a proper covering functor provided the following holds 1 is surjective on objects and finite to one 2 mor c s cs obj c s is a bijection we note that f r r is a proper covering functor using the uniformizers from the construction f m we can make the following construction let s j m d an ordering of m is a bijection o ik 1 k m where k m we shall write mo for the tuple o 1 o k we observe that g acts on bij ik m by g o g o consider fdm say gn o r defined by v a v a sa j v a ma da we consider the smooth manifold bij ik m o with the action of g by g o v a g o g v a we obtain the translation groupoid gn bij ik m o and the forgetful functor gn bij ik m o gno this functor is a proper covering functor which has the additional properties that between objects it is a surjective local diffeomorphism and the obvious map mor gn bij ik m o mor gno s fobj gn bij ik m o is a diffeomorphism there exists a commutative diagram gn bij ik m o r f y y gno r where o v a sa j v a m o a da on objects and on morphisms g o v a o v a ga g o g v a this is an example for a uniformizer construction for a proper covering this also works for the transition construction 22 joel w fish and helmut hofer lecture 3 3 the example of stable maps in sft the reader is assumed to be familiar with the basic concepts about stable hamil tonian structures see 9 or appendix 18 we start with q a non degenerate stable hamiltonian structure on the closed odd dimensional manifold q we obtain the reeb vectorfield r defined by r 1 and d r 0 associated to r we have the set of periodic orbits p p q and define p p given an admissible complex multiplication j for ker there exists a spectral gap function j p 0 2 which comes from a self adjoint operator associated to j and r which plays a role in the fredholm theory we fix an admissible weight function 0 define on p such that 0 0 j 3 1 stable maps of height one and regularity 3 0 a stable map of height one is a tuple s j d m u here s j is a closed riemann surface d a set of nodal pairs m unordered marked points positive and negative punctures respectively by u we denote an equivalence class of maps u s r q of class 3 0 two maps are equivalent provided they differ by a constant r shift at every positive puncture z the map u is asymptotic in the 3 0 sense to a periodic orbit z and similarly at z the map u is continuous over nodal pairs a trivial cylinder component is a connected component c of s with exactly one positive and negative puncture asymptotic to the same orbit and no marked points and nodal points moreover it is homotopic while being asymptotic to the periodic orbits to a standard cylinder parameterization in addition the following stability condition holds definition 3 1 we say s j d m u is stable provided s has at least one connected component c which is not a trivial cylinder component this component has at least one of the following properties where we write u a u 1 c u 0 c c 2 2 g c c m d 3 3 2 stable buildings given a stable map of height 1 we can take at positive punc tures the real projectification pr tz j and at negative punctures we take pr tz j we obtain which is a principle s 1 bundle naturally the stable buldings of height k 1 have the following form 0 b 1 1 b k k polyfolds and sft 23 figure 4 a stable building of height one one trivial cylinder component here each i is a stable map of height 1 and b i fits into the commutative diagram i 1 b i i y y i 1 bi i for i 1 k the map bi is a bijection and the periodic orbits associated to z i 1 and bi z coincide further the asymptotic limits are b i z matching with 0 b 1 b k k and i i si ji mi u i i we sometimes collect all the u i as u and the interface nodal pairs as consisting of all b i z for z i 1 and i 1 k with other words u u 0 b 1 b k u k alternatively we can identify b i z with a decorated node z z which is an equivalence class of oriented real lines in the tangent space tzsi 1 and tbi z si moreover we put s s 0 t tsk d d 0 t tdk and m m 0 t tmk then we can write as 0 s j m d u k which sometimes is the more convenient notation 3 3 the category of stable maps the category of stable maps of class 3 0 denoted by s s 3 0 q has the stable buildings of arbitrary height as objects a morphism is given by where 0 s j m d k 0 s j m k such that u i i u i an already nontrivial result is given by the following theorem theorem 3 2 s is a groupoidal category and its orbit space has a natural metrizable topology t and s t is a gct 24 joel w fish and helmut hofer given j we have the functor j s ban which associates to the hilbert space of t r q j valued 0 1 forms of class 2 0 along the underlying stable map we obtain a new groupoidal category ej where the objects are pairs e e j and morphisms are e with a morphism in s satisfying s and where we view the morphism as e e t e it turns out that the orbit space of ej has a natural metrizable topology so that ej t is a gct we obtain p ej s and can define the section functor j by j 1 2 t u j t u j definition 3 3 the coarse moduli space mj associated to j is the orbit space of the full subcategory of j holomorphic objects i e those for which j 0 the moduli category is the full subcategory associated to j holomorphic objects the following holds theorem 3 4 after fixing a suitable gluing profile and a strictly increasing se quence of admissible weight functions p has naturally the structure of a strong bundle over the tame polyfold s and j is fredholm the orbit space 1 j 0 inter sected with every connected component of s is compact the theorem means that after fixing and we have a natural uniformizer con struction f s set producing tame strong bundle uniformizers gnk ej p y p y gno s and a transition construction which produces tame strong bundles m m polyfolds and sft 25 the sc fredholm property of j means that the local representatives of the latter with respect to a j 1 j o k are sc fredholm we have a grading functor d s n 0 1 associating to 0 b 1 b k k its top floor number which is k i e the number of floors minus one having the tame polyfold structure we pick for a uniformizer f and o o with o then we can take do o which does not depend on the choice of and the polyfold structure has the property that d do o this map descends to the orbit space z s giving us the degeneracy index dz z n proposition 3 5 every z z has an open neighborhood u z such that dz u z dz z remark 3 6 we can also consider s which consists of stable buildings where the marked points are ordered the negative punctures on floor 0 are ordered and the positive punctures on the top floor are numbered as well then we have a forgetful functor s s which is also a proper covering functor similarly as in the case of stable riemann surfaces 3 4 basic topological structure the orbit space z s is metrizable and we can consider 0 z given a 0 z we can represent it by a building of height 1 with no nodal points say s j m u the compact space s might have different components and can be written as s sntctstc splitting it into trivial cylinder components and the rest we can consider 0 s and ntriv 0 s 0 s ntc we make the following rough classification definition 3 7 we say a 0 z is a parent provided 0 s 1 a a z is a descendent provided ntriv 0 s 1 and 0 s 1 a a z is a disjoint union provided ntriv 0 s 2 within the disjoint union we can also distinguish parent classes a which are charac terized by 2 ntriv 0 s 0 s and their descendents defined by 2 ntriv 0 s 0 s hence we have a splitting 0 z p 0 z t d 0 z t u 0 z and a further splitting u 0 z up 0 z t ud 0 z these distinctions are important for the perturbation theory and its inductive treat ment 26 joel w fish and helmut hofer parent descendant disjoint union parent disjoint union descendant figure 5 classification of classes in 0 z definition 3 8 given a 0 z we denote by sa the full subcategory of s associ ated to the objects with a a very important concept is that of a face definition 3 9 a face of z is the closure of a connected component in z z dz z 1 more about this later definition 3 10 let a 0 z and define facea to be the collection of faces con tained in a definition 3 11 for a face we denote by s the full subcategory associated to objects with isomorphism class in an important property is the following which we shall refer to as the polyfold structure on s being face structured theorem 3 12 every object belongs to precisely d many different s i e there exist precisely d many with a face a determines a a as follows take a representative a with d 1 written as b then a a is determined by a and a given a up 0 z take a representative with d 0 then the components c ntriv 0 s determine c which determine ac polyfolds and sft 27 3 5 grading and organization for the inductive procedures of perturbation theory later on we need a grading which is adjusted to the problem at hand in case of a stable hamiltonian structure the organizational issues are somewhat more complicated than in the case of a contact structure a organizational scheme for the the more general stable hamiltonian case is based on the use of of the following map a dja definition 3 13 define dj 0 z 1 0 1 2 a dja by dj a 1 if a mj max dz z z a mj if a mj 6 this organizes the elements in 0 z the following is very important theorem 3 14 1 if a p 0 z and a d 0 z is a descendent then dja dja 2 if facea for some a 0 z and comes from a a then dja 1 dja d j a 3 for a up 0 z we have the equality dja 1 c 0 s d j ac 1 4 if a up 0 and a ud 0 z is a descendent then dja dja the induction usually goes in the following order p 1 0 z d 1 0 z up 1 0 z ud 1 0 z p 0 0 z d 0 0 z up 0 0 z ud 0 0 z p 0 z d 0 z up 0 z ud 0 z as we shall see the only freedom to pick data is for the a p 0 z subject to some boundary compatibility i e faces which have data determined by the previous steps i e associated to 1 0 z the amount of construction at each step using d j is more involved compared to another possibility which arises dealing with a contact form in case q d is a manifold with a non degenerate contact form one can take another organizing princple which has in some sense more steps which however is less demanding on the level of constructing the multi sections both lead to the same result for contact manifolds but the latter cannot be used for stable hamiltonian structures directly the problem is that it might happen that dz z 0 is unbounded on many a 0 z when we describe the inductive scheme we shall restrict ourselves to the case of contact forms in the expanded version of this lecture note we shall describe the more general case as well 28 joel w fish and helmut hofer definition 3 15 the subset z of z consists of all so that all its trivial cylinder parts are j holomorphic we note that the definition does not depend on the choice of j we observe that the interiors of z and z are the same we shall introduce later on a topology t on z called the strong topology which is finer than t z and which will play a important role in the perturbation and compactness theory and we shall explain why it is important later on we note at this point thatmj z the perturbation will be done in such a way that the modified coarse moduli space still belongs to z that we introduce this topology has to do with some subtleties which we explain now a moduli space di eomorphic to a circle a moduli space di eomorphic to a point schematically figure 6 a moduli space of a union class part 1 polyfolds and sft 29 the figure 6 gives two moduli spaces one diffeomorphic to a closed interval the other to a point assume that one belongs to a and the other to a denote the union class by a which will have a two dimensional moduli space and is more complicated than one might think it is illustrated in the following figure 7 schematically the compacti cation of the union contains 1 dim family trivial holo morphic cylinder contains 2 dim family figure 7 a moduli space of a union class part 2 a problem arising in the inductive perturbation theory is that the perturbations up to level determine for a disjoint union class on level 1 the perturbation at the boundary as well as the perturbation in the interior the basic question is if they fit smoothly together the answer is that it depends on the sets on which the perturbations were carried out this is the reason for introducing t on z 30 joel w fish and helmut hofer lecture 4 4 structures on the category of stable maps 4 1 background assume we have are given a gct c equipped with a polyfold structure and an associated strong polyfold bundle p e c this allows to talk about interesting smooth objects we have seen that we can immediately distinguish three classes of sc smooth section functors sc smooth sc smooth sc fredholm it also allows to distinguish interesting sc smooth saturated full subcategories sat urated means that if an object is isomorphic to an object in the subcategory it also belongs to it such subcategories have the form cu where u c and are generated by the objects with isomorphism class in u interesting examples are in the stable maps case sa a 0 z s facea recall that a submanifold m of a m polyfold o is a subset such that every point m m has an open neighborhood u m and a sc smooth retraction r u u with r u m u recall that sc smooth means that r u u 1 is defined and sc smooth m has an induced m polyfold structure which on the subset of points with dm m 0 is the same as a classical smooth manifold structure if m is tame it is a classical smooth manifold with boundary with corners consider a functor c 0 1 q it defines a full subcategory supp associated to all objects c with c 0 the subcategory is saturated in the sense that all isomorphic objects belong to it each object c in this subcategory carries the weight c 0 1 we shall call a full weighted subcategory it defines a subset supp c definition 4 1 we say is of manifold type provided the following holds 1 only takes values in 0 1 2 each element with positive weight has trivial isotropy 3 for every object c with positive weight pick a uniformizer f c with gno c then there exist a submanifold m of o containing o and an open neighborhood u u o such that u u 0 1 q satisfies o 1 for o u m and 0 otherwise theorem 4 2 if is of manifold type supp has in a natural way the structure of a smooth manifold polyfolds and sft 31 definition 4 3 is of orbifold type provided the following holds 1 only takes values in 0 1 2 for every object c with positive weight pick a uniformizer f c with g n o c then there exist a submanifold m of o containing o and an open gc invariant neighborhood u u o such that o 1 for o u m and 0 otherwise theorem 4 4 if is of orbifold type the orbit space of supp has in a natural way the structure of a smooth orbifold the most general class is given in the following definition definition 4 5 is of branched weighted orbifold type provided for every object c with positive weight the following holds for a uniformizer f c with gno c there exist finitely many submanifolds mi of o containing o and an open gc invariant neighborhood u u o such that o 1 i i i o mi for o u m and 0 otherwise one can show that the orbit space of supp has in a natural way the structure of what is called a weighted branched orbifold there is a whole theory 52 about orientations about sc smooth differential forms on c a de rham complex and a stokes formula there are related ideas in 67 4 2 preliminaries for a perturbation theory of j consider the functor 0 e q the latter only has the identities as morphisms defined by 0 0 1 and 0 e 0 otherwise then 0 j 0 means that j 0 i e is a j holomorphic object in this case supp 0 j mj for a uniformizer g n k e consider 0 g n k q for the tame strong bundle p k o let s be the zero section which is a sc section i e in particular sc smooth then 0 k s s p k k next we observe that 0 j 0 the set of points o o for which this is positive consists precisely of all o with s o o this a polyfold fredholm problem and if we have tranversality it defines a smooth submanifold m of o then the functor 0 0 j over o can be written as 32 joel w fish and helmut hofer 0 and it takes value 1 if and only if it lies on the submanifold in this case 0 is a functor which is manifold like over the full subcategory s o perturbation theory and transversality theory in the presence of symmetries is always difficulty and we shall use as fukaya ono 27 the idea of multisections in functorial terms we need to introduce fractional objects with the assumption that any underlying object can only occur once this is accomplished by functors s 0 1 q these come together with the functors e 0 1 q which we shall call partition of unity having the property that e e 1 note that for as above the functor j has the before mentioned properties as we shall see there is a large world of sc smooth in general position to j such that is sc smooth and of branched orbifold type and a supp is for every a compact it is of course absolutely crucial that the perturbations are compatible with the algebraic structures on s responsible for the ability to encode certain data in the sft formalism 4 3 structures denote by p the category whose objects are maps m i p where i is a finite set a morphism b m m is a bijection b i i such that m b m concatenation structure p ev s ev p for example ev is the map k p which associates to a puncture the periodic orbit similarly ev 0 p we now can build a new category using the weak fibered product s p s observe that if are objects in s and there exists a morphism b ev ev we obtain the object b in the weak fibered product next we ob serve that this object is related to a finite number of objects in s namely there are finitely many lifts b such that b is an object in s and since d b 1 it belongs to the boundary s of the category s there is also an obvious associa tivity when considering these type of lifts or the other way round when forgetting decorations b b b b b b b b b b b b in the perturbation theory we would like not to perturb over trivial cylinder segments there the cauchy riemann operator is automatically transversal and in polyfolds and sft 33 addition the j holomorphic trivial cylinders play an important role as we shall see let us define the functor e e by setting e equal to zero on trivial cylinder components this functor covers the identity warning the functor is not sc smooth in the sense that 1 is a strong bun dle map however it has some sc smoothness properties in the sense that there are many local sc sections which satisfy s s over sz using sc multisection functors build on such special sc sections will turn out to be enough to deal with all occurring transversality issues around j we shall introduce this class of functors e u q 0 1 u t later on hence measured in this way has some sc smoothness properties by defining a sufficiently large class of sc smooth sections there is indeed a philosophical point here there are many types of natural functors which show very specific smoothness properties in the weak sense similarly to the property of just discussed having we impose on a partition of unity e 0 1 q the following first requirement e 0 id e e at this point our condition requires a partition of unity functor to have the prop erty that if it takes positive values on e it must hold true that e vanishes on trivial cylinder segments there is an other quite obvious requirement relat ing to the concatenation which we shall use to upgrade the requirement with 0 b 1 b k k and the obvious meaning of ei e 0 id e d i 0 i ei another crucial condition is connected with the occurrence of disjoint unions let be a stable map with d 0 and denote by s the space obtained by identifying x y for a nodal disk pair x y then s decomposes as s stc t s ntc and each connected component of s ntc has an associated stable map disjoint union structure forgetful c c ntriv 0 s the c are j holomorphic if the are this leads to the following requirement which encapsulates sft and which has to hold over a suitable full category s u where u is a so called strong neighborhood of mj in z which in addition satisfies certain 34 joel w fish and helmut hofer compatibility conditions with the structures at play e 0 id e d i 0 c ntriv 0 s i i c ei c for u 3 this formula relates the value of e to the value on smaller pieces provided belongs to some set u the inductive content of this formula is obvious it is also clear that in the inductive construction of with respect to some organization of 0 z the sets u a have to be constructed inductively too the goal of these lectures is to show that there are enough which are sc smooth i e sc multisections which are so small that in some sense to be made precise the orbit space of the support of j has a compact intersection with every a 0 z and the local problems are all in general position so that s 0 1 q is a weighted a branched orbifold in general position to the boundary of s once this is achieved we can study orientation questions for j one also needs to study the relationship between different obtained this way of course if we start turning the outline into a reality we need to know more about the polyfold structure for s and the strong bundle structure for p e s f e we need to understand enough about the smoothness properties of to describe the sc sections compatible with before we go into the necessary constructions we shall describe a result which will be an outcome for this we need to present some additional ideas given a face consider the saturated full subcategory s one can show that given in s and f say gno s the preimage of s is a tame sub m polyfold xo o invariant under g without going more into details we obtain the diagram gno sx inclx gnx o x o s tame sub m polyfold m x o x o m this can be interpreted as s being a subpolyfold and that it inherits a polyfold structure as well given s q 0 1 of branched weighted orbifold type we can formulate what it means that it is tame and in general position to the boundary of s which is the union of all s see 52 theorem 4 6 there are arbitrarily small sc multisection functors satisfying the requirement over a suitable strong neighborhood u of mj in general position to j so that j s q 0 1 is of weighted branched orbifold type polyfolds and sft 35 in general position to s and tame further for every a 0 z the intersection a supp is compact what means arbitrarily small has to be made precise we shall introduce a quan titative criterion if we have and obtained by making different choices the other result needed is to understand generic enough homotopies between them this will be addressed later and as we shall see this point is subtle due to transversality to the diagonal problems arising from the fact that one needs to consider certain types of fibered products we have now described many of the results we are aiming at and will start with the construction of the polyfold and strong bundle structure 4 4 additional structures there are some additional structural features which are important see 52 for background material starting with s we can construct a category s with a surjective forgetful functor s s and we do this as follows first of all we mark every periodic orbit t k in p by taking a specific representative t k this choice specifies the distinguished point 0 s 1 referred to as marker the objects of s are constructed from objects in s by adding some additional features start with 0 b 1 b k k first of all we order the marked points in m i e replace the set m by m 1 m by an ordered list then we number the positive punctures on the top floor and we also number the negative punctures on the bottom floor finally we add a decoration to each puncture z in 0 k i e pick an oriented real line in tzs such that the directional limit hits the asymptotic periodic orbit at the previously fixed marker note that the number of possible decorations for a bottom or top punctures is the covering number of the associated periodic orbit in the future when we talk about a decorated puncture we mean the negative ones on floor 0 and the the positive ones on the top floor recall that the interface nodal pairs are decorated further we shall consider matching punctures coming from the floor interfaces and we shall refer to them as decorated nodal pairs a morphism has the form where is a biholomorphic respecting the data in particular the numberings of the top punctures the bottom punctures as well as of the marked points moreover t is assumed to map decoration to decoration the forgetful functor s s is finite to one let be an object in s and denote by the number of positive and negative punctures on the top and bottom floor respectively let m be the number of marked points and denote by k 1 k the covering numbers of the asymptotic periodic orbits then the preimage of contains m k 1 k k 1 k many elements the functor is an example of a proper covering 36 joel w fish and helmut hofer functor it is surjective on objects and finite to one and further the following property holds the map mor s mor s s obj s s is a bijection here let us note that on trivial cylinder segments the two asymptotic markers are not correlated for example if we have a j holomorphic cylinder of covering number k there are k 2 different constellations however there are k many isomorphism classes using f m associated to s one can construct for every f in s an ep groupoid x with a proper covering functor fitting into the commutative diagram x s y y gno s the top arrow is injective on objects and fully faithful the functor is a proper covering functor namely it is a surjective local sc diffeomorphism and x s mor gno s x is a sc diffeomorphism a polyfold has a tangent bundle in our case this applies to s and s a uniformizer g n o s defines a bundle unifomizer t g n to ts fitting into the commutative diagram gn to t ts idnp y y gno 1 1 s 1 this allows to define sc differential forms on s and in fact the de rham complex the same holds for s details are in 52 working with s we have the evaluation at marked points functor s q tq t q q t q q q the pull back of a differential form on q etc is a sc differential form on s there is also a sc smooth forgetful functor in the dm space associated to ordered marked points forget s r of course it has to be made precise what sc smoothness means these structures are important for the construction of sft polyfolds and sft 37 part 2 local local constructions a stable map is defined on a riemann surface and as we have seen in part 1 we are interested in defining something like a smooth neighborhood of this object since the object class of a groupoidal category is not a set in general a notion of a neighborhood literally does not make sense and has to be substituted by an appropriate concept namely that of a uniformizer in some sense a uniformizer construction is the local theory however an object can be cut into smaller pieces since the riemann surface can be chopped up we see that the object is a fibered product of smaller pieces hence we might expect that the local pictures is obtained as a fibered product of a local theory around the local pieces the latter is what we refer to as the local local theory and as we have just discussed gluing the local local pieces we obtain the local theory of course there is still the question how the uniformizers interact recall the notion of transition construction and this can be considered as the global theory lecture 5 5 tools for local local constructions we begin with a method which is useful constructing new m polyfolds from old ones comprehensive references are 22 24 5 1 the imprinting method the imprinting method based on the following theorem is very powerful theorem 5 1 assume that x is a m polyfold and y a set and x y a surjective map with the following properties 1 the quotient topology t on y is metrizable 2 for every y y there exists u y t and h u y x such that a h idu y b h 1 u y x is sc smooth then y has a unique m polyfold structure characterized by the following properties i x y is sc smooth ii every h u y x which has the properties as in 2 is sc smooth the theorem motivates the following definition definition 5 2 a m polyfold structure on a set y defined by the imprinting method is given by a diagram x y which has the properties 1 and 2 stated in the theorem 38 joel w fish and helmut hofer 5 2 the gluing example we illustrate this by an example take a compact nodal riemann surface s j d perhaps with smooth boundary and consider the sc hilbert space e of maps u s rn consisting of maps of class h 3 0 c which means away from nodal points of class h 3 loc and at nodes exponentially asymptotic with decay rate 0 to the matching nodal value level m is defined by regularity m 3 m we fix disks around the nodal points and use the exponential gluing profile r e 1 r e we have a smooth manifold b of natural gluing parameters and for every such a we can consider sa ja da define y to be the union of all maps of class 3 0 defined on the various sa ja da and introduce b e y a u w where w is obtained as follows we shall use a smooth cut off function r 0 1 satisfying s 1 for s 1 s 0 for s 1 1 and s s 1 if z sa belongs to the core region which can be identified naturally with a subset of sa we define a u z u z on the glued necks we define a u as follows where for convenience we shall use standard coordinates as a model for a disk pair we take r s 1 r s 1 given a gluing parameter a 1 4 we define z 0 to be the above space and for nonzero a we set r a and a a e 2 i and define za to consist of all s t s t s t 0 r s 1 s t r 0 s 1 and s s r t t now the gluing of u u over za is defined by a u u s t s t s r 2 u s t s r 2 u s t let us write yn if the target is rn the construction is functorial in the sense that for a smooth map f rn rm the map yn ym u f u is sc smooth this cane be checked using the results in 50 hence y can be viewed as functor which associates to rn the m polyfold yn and to a smooth map f rn rm a sc smooth map the fact that y is such functor implies quite easily that it has an extension where the image is any smooth manifold q see 22 for a proof we summarize the discussion as follows denote by n the category whose objects are the various rn and the morphisms are the smooth maps we denote by m the category of m polyfolds and by mtame the full subcategory of tame m polyfolds theorem 5 3 the construction which associates to rn the m polyfold yn and to a smooth map f rn rm the map y f yn ym u f u is a covariant functor into mtame polyfolds and sft 39 that such functors have natural extensions to the category of smooth manifolds with smooth maps between them is not difficult to see and we shall give the argument later on 5 3 more properties of imprinting imprinting has some naturality properties theorem 5 4 assume that x is a m polyfold and y and z are sets and the maps 1 and 2 in the diagram x 1 y 2 z are surjective define x z by 2 1 assume further that 1 x y is an imprinting and assume that y is equipped with the associated m polyfold structure then the following two statements are equivalent 1 x z is an imprinting 2 2 y z is an imprinting moreover the induced m polyfold structures and topology on z by both constructions coincide here is another result which is very important for our approach theorem 5 5 assume that x y is a m polyfold construction by the imprinting method and y a subset of y if x 1 y is a sub m polyfold of x then x y where x is an imprinting the associated m polyfold construction on y defines the topology induced from y moreover y is a sub m polyfold of y and the induced m polyfold from y and the structure coincide the imprinting method is well behaved with certain trivial procedures theorem 5 6 product let x y and x y be two m polyfold constructions by imprinting then x x y y is a m polyfold construction by imprinting the induced m polyfold structure on y y is the product structure in particular the quotient topology t on y y is the product topology t t which is the topology having as basis the products of open sets here is another result theorem 5 7 disjoint union the disjoin union t of two imprintings is an imprinting 5 4 operations using the previously established results we can take the product and the disjoint union t of two given imprintings given x y 40 joel w fish and helmut hofer and an injective map y y with the property that x 1 y is a sub m polyfold of x we can consider the commutative diagram x y incl x x x 1 x y in this case with 1 x we see by a previous discussion that x y is an imprinting definition 5 8 given an imprinting x y and an injective map between sets y y we say that is admissible provided x 1 y is a sub m polyfold of x in this case we define the pull back by 1 1 y 1 y y the following is an easy exercise lemma 5 9 assume that x y is an imprinting and y y is admissible so that is defined suppose further y y is admissible for defining then is admissible for and naturally these are some basic operations which one can carry out to stay within the scope of imprinting constructions the playing field can be vastly extended by adding what we call restriction maps this is done in the next subsection 5 5 restrictions we start with a definition adding an additional piece of structure to the imprinting method definition 5 10 an imprinting with restriction is a pair p where x y is a m polyfold construction by imprinting and p is a finite family of maps pi y ai i i where the ai are m polyfolds and the compositions pi x ai are sc smooth the following definition will be crucial for fibered product constructions definition 5 11 assume that p and p are imprintings with restrictions and i 0 i and i 0 i are given so that ai 0 a i 0 we say that p and p are i 0 i 0 plumbable provided the subset x i 0 i 0 x x x x x pi 0 x p i 0 x of x x is a sub m polyfold polyfolds and sft 41 define y i 0 i 0 y y y y y pi 0 y p i 0 y and denote by y i 0 i 0 y y y the inclusion map take the product imprinting and observe that 1 y i 0 i 0 y x i 0 i 0 x which by assumption is a sub m polyfold define p pi 0 ti 0 p by p j pj 1 for j i i 0 p j 2 for j i i 0 4 where the i are the projections from the fibered product onto the first and second factor respectively definition 5 12 if p and p are i 0 i 0 plumbable we define the imprinting with restriction p i 0 i 0 p where i 0 i 0 and call it the i 0 i 0 plumbing of p and p for imprinting constructions with restrictions p and p we can define first the disjoint union t for a pair i i i

union of two imprinting constructions with restrictions is an imprinting construction with restrictions 5 6 submersive imprinting constructions with restrictions we also need some extensions

commutative diagram x y p y p y v v then the induced m polyfold structure on y is tame p is sc smooth and submersive and dv p y dy y for all y y polyfolds and sft 43 lecture 6 6 concrete local local constructions and operations we shall describe the local local constructions we are going to need for the later discussed polyfold constructions the basic input is the gluing construction described in the previous lecture 5 6 1 nodal given a nodal disk pair dx dy x y and weight sequence 0 0 1 we define the sc hilbert space e d of maps of class 3 0 which are continuous over the node and the set x 0 d r n by x 0 d r n e 0 d t 0 a 1 4 h 3 za rn we fix smooth compact concentric annuli ax dx and ay dy of the same mod ulus and can associate to them the sc hilbert spaces h 3 ax rn and h 3 ay rn we assume that ax corresponds under holomorphic polar coordinates to a subset contained in 0 20 s 1 we use the previously introduced bd e d x 0 d we also have the extraction of gluing parameter pbd x 0 d bd then we also obtain the restriction map h 3 ax rn px x 0 d r n py h 3 ay rn theorem 6 1 the tuple px py pbd is a submersive imprinting with restric tions we shall denote by x d r n the set x 0 d r

x d r n x d r m defined by u f u theorem 6 2 the construction x d defines a functor n mtame we shall call a functor like x d a construction functor their importance becomes clear in the next subsection 6 2 extension of construction functors the following definition applies to the classical and nodal case a somewhat modified version would apply to the periodic orbit case versions of the theorem below for various situations all rely on the same idea 44 joel w fish and helmut hofer definition 6 3 an m polyfold construction over n consists of a covariant func tor x which to each rn associates an m polyfold x n and to each morphism f rn rl it associates an sc smooth map x f x n x l moreover we require that the m polyfolds come with an additional structure namely that for each object rn we have a map which associates to a point u x n a subset im u rn which we call the image of u the following is assumed to hold 1 given an open subset u of rn the subset of x n consisting of all u with im u u is open in x n 2 we have im x f u f im u 3 if f g n l are morphisms and u x n then f im u g im u implies x f u x g u denote by m the category of smooth manifolds with the smooth maps as mor phisms the proof of the following theorem is given in 22 theorem 6 4 the functor x n m from a m polyfold construction over n has a natural extension x m m which associates to a manifold m in m a m polyfold x m and to a smooth map f m m an sc smooth map between the m polyfolds x f x m x m further we have a natural sc diffeomorphism x n x rn 6 3 periodic orbit next we consider the periodic orbit local local construction we assume we are given a weighted periodic orbit in rn we define the ssc hilbert manifold associate to an ordered nodal disk pair d dx t dy x y denoted by zd r rn it consists of tuples u u x x y u y where u x is a map on the punctured dx x and similarly for y moreover the following holds pick a representative x y and take holomorphic polar coordinates x and y then for a suitable u x x s t ts c x kt r x s t and u y y s t ts cy kt r y s t here r x and r y are in h 3 0 where 0 is an exponential weight we define level m in our space as such tuples where the latter is of regularity 3 m m theorem 6 5 zd r rn is a ssc hilbert manifold define the ssc manifold with boundary z 0 1 zd r rn and take the open neighborhood v of z defined as the collection of all r u where either r 0 polyfolds and sft 45 or if r 0 1 it holds that r cy cx 0 5 1 1 t r cy cx 0 1 4 define the set y 3 0 d 0 zd r rn 0 1 0 a 1 4 h 3 za r rn we define v y 3 0 d by 0 u x x y u y 0 u x x y u y and r u x x y u y r a u x r u y where a a x y and t a r cy cx we can also fix concentric annuli around the boundaries say ax and ay and define restriction maps where we particularly note the form of py px r w w ax and py r w r w ay we also have the map p 0 1 y 3 0 d 0 1 theorem 6 6 the tuple px py p 0 1 is a submersive imprinting with restric tions denote by y 3 d r r n the m polyfold just constructed we can build a category whose objects are pairs rn and the morphisms are smooth maps f rn rm where it is assumed t k f t k then we can associate to r u y 3 d r r n the element r id f u it turns out that this defines a construction functor and using the idea from theorem 6 4 also this functor has an extension to the category where the objects are pairs q t k that means we consider maps into r q being exponentially asymptotic to a suitable j holomorphic parameterization of the k fold covered cylinder r s 1 6 4 classical in this case we consider a compact riemann surface with smooth boundary j and define the ssc manifold h 3 r rn where level m is regularity 3 m we can take mutually disjoint boundary annuli say ai i i we have the restriction maps pi h 3 r rn h 3 ai and the tautological imprinting with id 46 joel w fish and helmut hofer 6 5 using operations assume that s j d is a compact nodal riemann sur face with smooth boundary and a finite group g acts on s j d by biholomorphic maps we can take a small disk structure d so that the associated union of disks is invariant for each dx take a concentric compact boundary annulus ax with smooth boundary so that the union of all ax is invariant under g for every x y d we have d x y dx tdy x y and the associated submersive construction with restrictions bd x y e d x y y h 3 ax rn px x 0 d r n py h 3 ay rn pbd x y y bd x y defining a x d ax and bd e and x rn as the obvious product we obtain bd e x rn p h 3 a rn pbd y bd we represent this lego type piece by the following picture it represents a part of the constructions needed to deal with the floors of a stable map a extraction of gluing parameter figure 9 a lego piece polyfolds and sft 47 from s j d and d we construct r j as follows we remove the union of the dx but glue in the ax then r j has besides it original boundary coming from s also the additional boundary with annuli whose union is a this gives a diagram as depicted in figure 10 a r bold boundary figure 10 another lego piece the fibered product with respect to the a part gives a m polyfold construction functor for s j d with d which considers the union of all maps of class 3 0 with domains being the glued s we have a submersion which is the extraction of the gluing parameter moreover if we can partition the union of boundary components in unions which are g invariant we have several restrictions assume we have a partition of the old boundary into an upper part and a lower part in this case we obtain a submersive imprinting with restrictions this is represent by the following figure 11 s j d d b b guing parameter figure 11 a bigger piece from a fibered product construction 48 joel w fish and helmut hofer we note that the new construction is also a construction functor and we have extensions to manifolds in short we have used a fibered product construction to obtain from several construction functors a new one it is based on a compact nodal riemann surface which has a partition of its boundary into an upper part and a lower part and a finite group acting by biholomorphic maps preserving the decomposition of the boundary in addition one has fixed a small disk structure d and considers the associated glued surfaces on these we consider maps of some sobolev class with image in rn this is equipped with a m polyfold structure via the imprinting method since everything behaves well with respect to smooth maps f rn rm we obtain a construction functor associated to the periodic orbit situation we can make the following construction assume we have several periodic orbits i i 1 k we assume that the images of the various i are disjoint we obtain the submersive yd x y r r n i 0 1 and we take the product and pull back by the diagonal map 0 1 0 1 k b b extraction of r figure 12 a bigger piece from a fibered product construction and pull back the two boxed displays represent construction functors with restrictions and some submersive extractions of data we shall use them for the constructions related to sft polyfolds and sft 49 part 3 from local local to local we show how to obtain from the local local theory the local theory by fibered product constructions lecture 7 7 constructions associated to stable maps we shall use the results obtained so far to carry out constructions associated to stable maps 7 1 data preparation we start with a stable map 0 b 1 b k k where each i is written as i i si ji mi di u i i the stable map comes with a finite automorphism group g which preserves the positive punctures x x x x u negative punctures i figure 13 a floor of a stable building a representative of u i has image in r q floor structure a representative u i of u i has its image in r q we extract 0 b 1 bk k with i i si ji di i essentially ignoring marked points but we remember where they were we have the group g acting on i by biholomorphic 50 joel w fish and helmut hofer d d 0 1 1 figure 14 the domain of a stable building with two floors and the fixed disks maps we fix a finite g invariant subset i called an anchor set which is disjoint from the points in di mi and i i i we fix closed disks with smooth boundaries around the nodal points in di for i 0 k so that the union is invariant under g we denote the collection by di we fix disks around i giving d i for i 0 k 1 and around i for i 1 k giving d i we pick all these disks small enough so that they are mutually disjoint and are also disjoint from the points in i and mi 0 and k we take compact annuli in the disks associated to i and denote their union by a i removing d i from si and adding a i we obtain a i ri ji di i a i for i 1 k 1 6 and 0 r 0 j 0 d 0 0 a 0 and a k rk jk dk k k 7 polyfolds and sft 51 we also obtain di 1 i for i 1 k where di 1 i is the union of the ordered disk pairs dz dbi z z bi z z i 1 with associated a i 1 di 1 i a i 8 what we are doing is to consider data associated to the floors as 6 and data for the interfaces which we shall introduce soon anchor set a i a i figure 15 this shows the situation for a floor the interfaces are being dealt with separately 7 2 m polyfolds for floors and interfaces we shall first consider the situation on the floors and then on the interfaces the following are all imprinting construc tions previously discussed 7 2 1 floors associated to what is represented in figure 15 we have a construction functor which associates to r rn maps on the glued surfaces as discussed earlier we take the sub m polyfold which is a global sc smooth retraction consisting of the elements for which the anchor average with respect to i vanishes av i u 1 i z i ai z 0 52 joel w fish and helmut hofer let us denote the functor associated to the i th floor by fi there is a submersive map extracting the gluing parameter for the nodal points from the i th floor pdi fi bdi and there are the restrictions associated to the lower and upper union of annuli a i giving us a i h 3 a i r r n rest i fi rest i h 3 a i r r n a i here are the submersive i th floor lego with restrictions where for the middle diagram we have that i 1 k 1 a 0 x rest 0 z 0 f 0 pd 0 bd 0 a ix rest i zi fi pdi bdi yrest i a i zk fk

by first restricting the map to the union of annuli a i and then using the r action shifting by ri if ri 6 0 we can line up all these construction functors and use fibered product and obtain a new submersive construction functor f 0 1 k bd which is a m polyfold construction for a given r rn together with a weighted periodic orbit assignment polyfolds and sft 53 7 3 assembling the pieces we line up the diagrams constructed in lecture 7 and take a fibered product zk fk pdk bdk yrest k a k a ix rest i zi 1 i fi 1 i p 0 1 0 1 yrest i 1 a i 1 a 1 x rest 1 z 0 1 f 0 1 p 0 1 0 1 yrest 0 a 0 x rest

working with x we introduce another set which is in natural bijection to x and whose elements are more intuitive and will be used in the uniformizer construction more precisely we shall construct an open subset of a ssc manifold o and a set z 3 r r n z fitting into the following diagram z x y y bd o z 3 r r n z 9 where the first vertical arrow is a ssc diffeomorphism and the second one a bijection hence is an imprinting the diagram bd o z 3 r r n z is more useful for the further constructions as we already said we carry this out in the next lecture we shall refer to it as the work horse m polyfold polyfolds and sft 55 lecture 8 8 the workhorse m polyfold we shall construct the lower part of the diagram 9 we assume that we started with a stable map 0 b 1 b k k and extracted the domain data to carry out the previously described constructions 8 1 two ssc manifolds given 0 b 1 bk k where i i si ji di i we assume that we have an assignment z which associates to a puncture a weighted periodic orbit further we assume that the assignment is compatible with bi finally we assume that we are given an action of a finite group g preserving the floor structure and acting by biholomorphic maps and preserving the other structure which was given we fix an anchor set 0 t t k which is invariant under g and make the following definition definition 8 1 the ssc manifold z 3 r rn z consists of tuples u u 0 b 1 b k u k where u i is of class 3 0 asymptotic to the weighted periodic orbits prescribed by z so that the data across interfaces is b i matching and the anchor averages vanish next we consider the open subset o of 0 1 k z 3 r r n z defined as follows definition 8 2 the open subset o consists of all tuples r 1 rk u where u u 0 b 1 b k u k so that the following holds either ri 0 or if ri 0 1 we have for z i 1 ri cz u cbi z u 0 10 1 1 tz ri cz u cbi z u 0 1 4 here cz u are the asymptotic constants which we obtain introducing holomorphic polar coordinates on the disks of the small disk structure further tz is the period associated to the periodic orbit associated to z and bi z respectively then bd o is a ssc manfold which will be important for the further constructions 8 2 definition of the basic space we fix for every nodal pair in di and for every interface pair z bi z where z i 1 a compact disk pair with smooth boundary so that the union is invariant under the group action hence we obtain a small disk structure d a gluing parameter a is a map associating to x y di an element a x y b x y and to z zi di 1 1 an element a z z b z z we shall write ai 56 joel w fish and helmut hofer for the restriction to di and ai 1 i for the restriction to di 1 i we assume that the disks do not contain points in and m we denote the smooth manifold of gluing parameters by b definition 8 3 a gluing parameter a for is admissible provided for every i 1 k it holds that either all a z z 0 or all are nonzero for z z di 1 i if for some i we have that ai 1 i 0 then we say we a nontrivial i 1 i interface the subset of b consisting of admissible gluing parameter is denoted by bad with the small disk structure we obtain the enhanced 0 b 1 bk k where i i si ji di i given a we have the associated interface sequence for this define a to be the number of elements i 1 k such that ai 1 i 0 we can list these elements as 0 i 1 i k and set i 0 0 and i 1 k 1 hence we obtain the map a i 1 a i a a we define ea for e 0 by ea ie sea j e a d e a ie 1 1 here we glue for e 0 the surfaces sie sie 1 1 at their nodes and at their trivial interfaces ie ie 1 ie 1 2 ie 1 1 the nodal pairs dea consist of those elements in die t tdie 1 1 which have vanishing gluing parameters we obtain a 0 a bi 1 a bi a a the disks of the small disk structure d define a small disk structure for a denoted by da and we obtain the enhanced a 0 a di 1 1 i 1 di 1 i a given the original periodic orbit assignment z the restriction to a 0 i 1 1 i 1 i k is denoted by z a hence we obtain the collection a z a a admissible gluing parameter we also have the original anchor set 0 t t k given an admissible gluing parameter a we have the associated anchor set a associated to a defined by a i 0 t i 1 t t i we shall also use the remnants of the omitted i which can be naturally identified with subsets of the glued a for every admissible a we have a and we consider maps on the underlying punctured domain of class 3 0 which are asymptotic to the periodic orbits prescribed by z a moreover for the interfaces we have matching polyfolds and sft 57 a figure 16 the enhanced and a glued enhanced a data b ie in addition we require that the anchor averages vanish for the ie for e 1 and the following relationship with virtual anchor values writing the data as w w 0 b i 1 b i w we require 1 av ie w 0 for e 0 2 for every e 0 av i 1 w av i w for ie i ie 1 58 joel w fish and helmut hofer a anchor anchor anchor virtual anchor figure 17 anchor and virtual anchor finally we define the set z 3 0 r r n z to consist of all the tuples of maps just described 8 3 the imprinting recall the ssc manifold bd o given a r 1 rk u we first construct an admissible gluing parameter a in bad as follows polyfolds and sft 59 definition 8 4 we set a d a for i 0 k we define for z i 1 the gluing parameter a z bi z b z as follows if ri 0 we put a z bi z 0 and otherwise we define it by t a z bi z ri c bi z u cz u hence given a r 1 rk u we obtain the total admissible gluing parameter a and an admissible a the imprinting is defined as follows given a r 1 rk u we construct a and consider its sequence of nontrivial interface indices 0 i 0 i 1 i i 1 k 1 we take the data u u 0 b 1 bk u k and produce the shifted u as follows for i 0 1 k we define with ie i ie 1 e 0 u i rie 1 ri u i then we define w e by ordinary gluing w e a e u ie u i and finally w w 0 b i 1 b i w i which is an element in z 3 0 r r n z theorem 8 5 bd o z 3 0 r r n z is an imprinting and defines als a construction functor as a consequence we can define z 3 r q z note that theorem 8 5 is concerned with the bottom horizontal line in 9 and we leave it to the reader to fill in the vertical arrows 8 4 transversal constraints relevant for us is a suitable sub m polyfold asso ciated to picking a stabilization set and suitable transversal constraints recall that we started with a stable map an element w of the m polyfold z 3 r q z takes the form w w 0 b i 1 b i w e where the w e are defined on a possibly glued surface a where a is an sc smooth function of w for unglued interfaces the transition and relationship between the asymptotic periodic orbits is given by the b ie where i 1 i is the sequence of nontrivial interface indices we recall that for such an element the anchor values av i w are defined for i 0 k here the sets i are naturally identified as subsets of the underlying glued surface associated to a for w with nontrivial interface sequence 0 i 1 i k it follows by definition of the m polyfold z 3 r q z that av ie w 0 for e 0 60 joel w fish and helmut hofer let be a finite subset of the underlying domain of which does not belong to the disks of the small disk structure and is also disjoint from the anchor points and the points in 0 t k the points in m and nodal points we assume also that is invariant under g since g preserves floors the decomposition 0 k where i consists of the points on the i th floor is being preserved given z i we denote by z its g orbit for every z we consider two possible cases of associating to it a co dimension two constraint in the first case we consider a submanifold h z of q of co dimension 2 and define h z r h z 11 which we shall call a r invariant constraint in the second case we take a submanifold of q of co dimension 1 and define h z a z h z 12 after fixing constraints as described above we obtain a map which associates to z the submanifold h z of codimension two in r q it is important that this map factors through the orbits of we shall abbreviate the assignment by h and call it a set of transversal constraints definition 8 6 with d and let h be a set of transversal constraints the subset z 3 h r q z of z 3 r q z consists of all w such that the following holds for every i 0 k 1 av i w w z h z for z i 2 the intersection of the shifted map w in the above at z is transversal we shall take later on as above but assume that s j m d is a stable riemann surface where m m 0 and d d z bi z z i 1 i 1 k now we can give the uniformizer construction polyfolds and sft 61 lecture 9 9 uniformizers and transition germs we shall describe a very useful variant of the uniformizer and transition construc tion when we introduced the notion of a local uniformizer construction f c set we assumed that c t was a given gct however very often in applica tions the starting point is just a groupoidal category these in fact have a natural metrizable topology but constructing it would already require some of the argu ments necessarily arising in the local uniformizer construction so it seems to make sense to construct the topology at the same time as the local uniformizers since the topology already occurs in the definition of a local uniformizers and the topol ogy is determined by all the uniformizers there is something like a chicken or egg problem for that reason one replaces the notion of a local uniformizer by that of a uniformizer where local refers to the compatibility with the topology which we do not have a uniformizer has the same properties as a local uniformizer but we do not require that is a local homeomorphism of course the construction m has to be replaced by one say f which gives a topology and a transition construction albeit in a more tricky way 9 1 abstract uniformizer construction we first define what we understand by a uniformizer construction definition 9 1 let c be a groupoidal category a uniformizer at an object c with automorphism group g is a functor gno c with the following properties 1 gno is the translation groupoid associated to a m polyfold o equipped with an action of g by sc diffeomorphisms 2 there exists o o with o c 3 is injective on objects 4 is full and faithful we shall call a tame uniformizer provided o is tame the constructions which are important for us are the uniformizer constructions definition 9 2 a uniformizer construction is a functor f c set which associates to an object c a set of uniformizers if f c for every object c only contains tame uniformizers we shall call f a tame uniformizer construction as in the case of local uniformizers we can consider the transition sets m the second important construction is what we call a transition germ construction f as we shall see a uniformizer construction f together with a transition germ construction f produces a natural topology t for the orbit space c and m polyfold structures for the transition sets m in any given application one needs to 62 joel w fish and helmut hofer verify that the natural topology t is metrizable in fact it is not difficult to come up with examples where the natural topology would not even by hausdorff assuming that that the natural topology passes the metrizability test the functor f will become a local uniformizer construction for the gct c t and the construction of the m polyfold structure for m will be a transition construction hence f f for the groupoidal category c implies f m for the gct c t provided t is metrizable we discuss the transition germ construction next 9 2 abstract transition germs construction we assume that at this point we have the uniformizer construction f c set associated to this uniformizer construction we can build the transition setsm the new type of construction is as follows and is denoted by f and we assume that we are given a groupoidal category c and have a uniformizer construction f for it definition 9 3 let f be a uniformizer construction a transition germ construction f associates for given f c and f c to h o o m a germ of map fh o o o m h with the following properties where fh t fh a diffeomorphism property the germ fh o o o o o o is a local sc diffeomorphism and s fh q q for q near o if and h o g o g o then fh q q g q g q for q near o so that fh q g q b stability property ffh q p fh p for q near o s h and p near q c identity property fu o q u q for q near o d inversion property f h fh q fh q for q near o s h here p o o 1 o e multiplication property if s h t h then fh fh q fm h h q for q near o s h and m fh fh q fh q fm h h q for q near o s h f m hausdorff property for different h 1 h 2 m with o s h 1 s h 2 the images under fh 1 and fh 2 of small neighborhoods are disjoint as already previously stated it is a general fact that the constructions f f define a natural topology t on c for which the are homeomorphisms onto open subsets and they define m polyfold structures on them if t is metrizable a fact which has to be proved in any given context then f f implies a construction f m for the gct c t see 52 and 24 example 9 4 here is an example how a non metrizable topology may arise con sider the groupoidal category c with objects being the points in 0 1 r and the morphisms besides the identities being the pairs 0 t 1 t 0 t 1 t and polyfolds and sft 63 similarly 1 t 0 t for t 0 if we equip 0 1 r with the obvious metrizable topology the orbit space obtains a non hausdorff topology one can give a uni formizer and transition germ construction for c which will yield this topology this will apply in the case of the category of stable maps s and we shall start the associated discussion later on in the present lecture in order to digest the definition of f one should note that the basic ingredients are that given a morphism o o defining h o o there exists an associated sc diffeomorphism fh u o o u o o and a family q hq for q u o so that fh q q hq fh q the latter gives a notion being able to say that fh p is close to fh q if p u o close to q u o the stability conditions then say ffh q for q u o has the form ffh q p p fh p fh p for p close to q the other properties are self evident 9 3 preparation for the sft uniformizer construction next we begin the uniformizer construction f s set it requires some preparation we are given the closed odd dimensional manifold q equipped with a non degenerate stable hamiltonian structure i e q fixing a compatible j we get the spectral gap map j p 0 2 and pick for the periodic orbits weight sequences resulting in we can define the category of stable maps s 3 0 q first we shall describe the construction of uniformizers we start with an object 0 b 1 b k k and underlying 0 b 1 bk k having isotropy group g we fix a stabilization set which is invariant under g with associated constraints h and disjoint from nodes and punctures anchor sets and a small disk structure d so that the union of disks associated to di and the d i 1 i are invariant and do not contain marked points and are mutually disjoint we also require that s j m d is a stable riemann surface where m m 0 k and d d z bi z z i 1 i 1 k the data which we have is then and a small disk structure d stabilization set and transversal constraints h h z z anchor set we can build the m polyfold z 3 h r q z which has a distinguished element u coming from the m polyfold structure is induced from the ambient m polyfold z 3 r q z of which our space is a sub m polyfold in fact a tame one the sc smooth embedding z 3 h r q z incl z 3 r q z 13 64 joel w fish and helmut hofer anchor stabiilization points figure 18 associated to the orbits of stabilization points under g we have transversal constraints will be important to us we have an action of g on s j m d which preserves the floors of course has a larger finite automorphism group denoted by g then g g and we have seen in the discussion of the dm theory that can take particular deformation v 3 v j v of j such that g n v bd r v a sa j v a m a da polyfolds and sft 65 defines a good unformizer when restricted to g no where o v bd is a suitable open g invariant neighborhood of 0 0 recall that there exists a uniformizer construction for r it is important that we have the splitting which was described in the discussion of dm theory h 1 h 1 tc 0 h 1 ntc 0 h 1 tck h 1 ntck 14 v vtc 0 vntc 0 vtck v ntc k the following piece of data is important the good uniformizer around coming from g no r v a sa j v a m a d a 15 9 4 pre uniformizer the first step in the uniformizer construction is the con struction of pre uniformizers we shall construct what we shall call pre uniformizers namely given and having carried out the preparations described above we define pre gn v z 3 h r q z s as follows the element u z 3 h r q z has underlying domain sa and gluing parameter a we set pre v u sa j v a ma da a u this is short hand for the following the element u decomposes as u u 0 b i 1 b i u i where u e is defined on the punctures a e se a j v e a ma e da e u e a e the uni formizers then will be obtained by restricting pre uniformizers to suitable subsets this will happen in the next lecture the basic fact is that the knowledge of s allows us to formulate a recipe i e a general rule to characterize for a constructed pre neighborhoods g invariant neighborhoods o of 0 u so that gn o s obtained as pre gno many different choices of o are possible for a given pre so that the has very specific properties this will define a functor f s set by associating to the set of obtained by constructing a set of all possible pre uniformizers following the recipe for pre uniformizer constructions and then using these to take all allowable restrictions according to the recipe we have to define the recipe has the feature that for given f and f one has enough properties to carry the transition germ construction f 66 joel w fish and helmut hofer part 4 from local to global we shall study the global relationships between the local pieces lecture 10 10 uniformizers and transition germs for sft we shall describe the construction of a polyfold structure on s 10 1 background for the uniformizer construction we have outlined the construction of a pre uniformizers at an object the unformizer construction will define a criterion for picking for a given pre at with special element o 0 u a g invariant neighborhood o so that the restriction to gno say gno s will have desirable properties the collection of all such g n o s obtained by taking suitable restrictions of pre uniformizers will define f clearly we want that gno s is full and faithful to reflect the structure of s we also would like to have injectivity of on objects distinguishing particular full subcategories of s figure 19 the images of three different gno s associated to polyfolds and sft 67 it is clear that dm theory for the underlying g no r will play a role which require that for v u o we must have that v a u o the first basic result is the following proposition 10 1 given an object and a pre uniformizer pre there exists an open g invariant neighborhood o of o in v z 3 h r q z with the following properties 1 if v u o then v a u o 2 the restriction of pre denoted by gno s is a fully faithful functor and injective on objects the only more involved step is the fullness of for a suitable o taking for the collection f consisting of the which are obtained as restrictions of pre uniformizers which satisfy 1 and 2 is not yet a uniformizer construction but a suitable subset of every f will be we need to show that for a suitable choice of o a third very important condition can be satisfied this condition is a kind of transversality condition and it is not so easy to guess and also is not necessary for which are not too complicated so it might be easily overlooked in the following we shall refer to the image o as a slice figure 20 the transition construction one needs a criterion given an arrow from one slice to a slice how to distinguish a family of arrows starting nearby so that the output varies sc smoothly of course if the two slices are identical the families should come from g moreover there should be an associativity for three slices and obvious other properties 68 joel w fish and helmut hofer the problem highlighted in the figure 20 leads to a transversality question which will be discussed next a priori such a transversality question involves obviously the properties of and at the same time for a uniformizer construction we are forced to give a recipe defining for a given the set f i e to define properties for its members f without reference to elements f with other words it is better true that a transversality condition exists which can be formulated for every so that the construction of f achieves the goal formulated in the caption of figure 20 10 2 a transversality question in the previous subsection we have learned that one can obtain certain properties for g n o s when one restricts a pre uniformizer to a smaller g invariant neighborhood of the distinguished element we shall consider two such and i e restrictions of pre uniformizers to g n o and g no where o and o are such that the conclusion of proposition 10 1 holds and motivate why an additional property is needed we shall refer to them for the following discussion as uniformizers we assume we are given two objects and and associated uniformizers and and consider an element h m that means we are given o o o o and o o we need conditions so that we can give a recipe for the local germ fh which of course is based on exhibiting a locally unique deformation of h q hq for q close to o all these arrows are supposed to start at q and to end in the slice associated to so that we can define fh o o o o o by fh q q hq fh q of course fh is determined by the recipe defining h and one needs to show that fh is a germ of sc diffeomorphism of course not surprisingly the criterion for determining such a unique choice is some kind of transversality and as already pointed out this transversality condition should not be a condition on the pair but a condition on the individual so that any such pair has favorable properties for the following note that we shall denote a global gluing parameter by a rather than a recall that our convention was that a is the d part of a but this will be ignored for the moment we shall over line fixed reference data and usually study small variations of the data so that for example a is a variation of a assume that o v u o v u with underlying total gluing parameters denoted by a and a the morphism is represented by a biholomorphic map a v a v which has to preserve the usual data namely sends marked points in ma to marked points in m a nodal pairs in da to nodal pairs in d a and punctures in a to those in a if we consider u u 1 we know that adjusting the different floors by polyfolds and sft 69 using the r action we obtain the map u which satisfies the anchor constraints not general the virtual ones this map u belongs to z 3 h r q z of course v u o for every i 0 k with z i it holds av i u u z h z z i and varying z the intersection is transversal we note that the left hand side is r invariant and therefore we need not to work with u we rewrite the above as av i u 1 u 1 z h z z i in order to construct fh we need to find a map v u v u with sufficiently smooth properties defined for v u near v u so that av i u 1 v u u 1 v u z h z z i and the intersection is transversal with respect to a variation of z if z belongs to ntc the adjustment by the anchor average is not needed since the associated constraint h z is r invariant but the left hand side will only be a sc smooth function of input if this adjustment is made due to vanishing gluing parameters the unique solvability of this equation will follow from an implicit function theorem provided the appropriate hypotheses hold we shall discuss this in the next subsection in more detail here we only note the following denote by the preimage of under the set is a subset of the riemann surface associated to the parameters v a and with these two parameters fixed we can consider deformations v a x where x maps a point z to a nearby point on the same surface we can do the same for nearby parameters v a and consider v a x where x maps points in to points in the surface associated to v a using the universal property of v a v a there exists a uniquely defined deformation v a x v a x of which maps sa j v a 0 m x k a d a v a x s a j v a m a d a where v a is a smooth function of v a x if v u is near v u which also means that v a u is near to v a one needs to show that for x close to x defined by x z z for z it holds that there exists a unique x x v a a a u with av i u 1 v a x u 1 v a x z h z for z i which also would be smoothly depending on v a of course then the germ where means r adjustments to satisfy the effective anchor constraints v u v v u u 1 v a x v u 16 70 joel w fish and helmut hofer is fh at this point one could only claim that fh is sc smooth using results about domain transformations see 24 it is not clear that fh is a local sc diffeomorphism this would follow by interchanging the roles of and if the same discussion would hold as it turns out the fact that fh is sc smooth only depends on an additional property of besides the properties already required from and if also satisfies such an additional property to be stated interchanging the roles of and will imply that fh is in fact a local sc diffeomorphism the germ fh would be defined by fh v u v u h v u fh v u where h v u is the morphism associated to the biholomorphic map 1 v a x v u as we mentioned before the property that fh is sc smooth will only depend on an additional requirement on the basic reason is the following the biholomorphic map v a x can be decomposed as follows take for v a near v a a smooth section x v a with x v a z z we mean by this that x v a belongs to the surface sa equipped with j v a and varies smoothly as a function of v a associated to this we obtain by the universal property v a v a x v a which maps preserving the obvious other data from the surface associated to v a to the surface associated to v v a a v a given v a x we can use v a to map this data to some y via v a x v a v a x were y v a x note that the choice of x for fixed v a does not affect v a the right hand side is now data on a surface associated to we see that for fixed v a we have a local diffeomorphism between deformations of and deformations of given a small open neighborhood of v u in o we can map it via v u v u 1 v a u 17 into and open neighborhood of v u in z 3 r q z observe that the image of v a satisfies the constraints associated toh but the images of the other elements in the small neighborhood usually do not next we consider v a y and using the universal property there exists v a y s a j v a 0 m y k a d a v a y s a j v a m a d a where v a depend smoothly on the input v a y we note the important fact that v a x v a x v a v a polyfolds and sft 71 this implies the possibility that by picking v a y properly we can adjust the image of the map in 17 via v a y to satisfy the constraints the appropriate choice of y then defines a choice of x from this discussion it follows that we only need to map the before mentioned small open neighborhood in z 3 r q z by a suitable choice of v a y v a into z 3 h r q z of course the map v a y v a has to be found by an implicit function theorem but the entire procedure only depends on this is being discussed in more detail in the next subsection in terms of to simplify notation i e getting rid of the primes 10 3 the transversality condition as we have seen the transversality condi tion is a property which can be formulated for a single rather than with we shall work with to formulate it we also consider for simplicity the inverses of the maps considered in the previous subsection the transversality condition depends on two ingredients the first one is the universal property from dm theory we started with a stable map fixed a stabilization set and a small disk structure d from this we obtain s j m d where m m t t 0 t k and d d t z bi z z i i 0 k 1 then taking a good deformation j with previously described properties we obtain the good uniformizer g no r a v sa j v a m a d a 10 3 1 stabilization deformation we consider the good uniformizer for r and use its universal property recalling that the points in were artificially added via the transversal constraint construction and that adding stabilized the riemann sur face for given a 0 v 0 o the universal property guarantees a g invariant open neighborhood u of the form u u z u z we denote by u the smooth manifold of maps x u with x z u z for such a x we define m x 0 tm t x t k by the universal property there exists for x near x defined by x z z a uniquely determined biholomorphic map near the identity a 0 v 0 x sa j v a m a d a sa 0 j v 0 a 0 m x a 0 d a 0 where a v is a smooth map of a 0 v 0 x definition 10 2 we shall refer to the data a 0 v 0 x a 0 v 0 x and a a 0 v 0 x v a 0 v 0 x the stabilization deformation 72 joel w fish and helmut hofer stabilization deformation a 0 v 0 x sd a a 0 v 0 x v a 0 v 0 x x a 0 v 0 x a 0 v 0 x a 0 v 0 x sa j v a m a d a sa 0 j v 0 a 0 m x a 0 d a 0 j v 0 v 0 deformation parameter a 0 gluing parameter marked point stabilization point new position nodal point stabilization point old position j v a surface with v 0 a 0 and stabilization points at new position is biholomorphic to surface with v a and stabilization points at original position the data v a depends smoothly on v 0 a 0 position figure 21 stabilization deformation polyfolds and sft 73 if we restrict o to some smaller g invariant neighborhood and u to a suitable u we can obtain some uniformity of the stabilization deformation with respect to the input a 0 v 0 x more precisely we obtain proposition 10 3 there exists a g invariant open neighborhood o of 0 0 con tained in o and a sufficiently small open g invariant neighborhood u u where u is again the disjoint union of disk like u z such that there exists a smooth map a uniform version of the sd transformation o u o 18 a v x a v a a v x v a v x and a uniquely determined sc smooth family of biholomorphic a v x with 0 0 x id a v x sa j v a m a d a sa j v a m x a d a so that in addition the points in m k 0 sa and m k 0 sa are point wise fixed and z is mapped to x z in addition the points of unglued nodal pairs or the points of unglued ordered interface nodal pairs are being point wise preserved 10 3 2 a very special retraction we have the inclusion z 3 h r q z z 3 r q z as sub m polyfold and coming from there is the special element u 0 belonging to z 3 h r q z recall that v h 1 is the open neighborhood of 0 occurring in the deformation v j v we define q 0 0 u 0 and shall denote for a given map w by w the map obtained by making suitable r shifts so that the anchor averages vanish before we state the result we describe the idea the element q 0 0 u 0 has the property that for u 0 its anchor averages vanish and the transversal constraints are satisfied in the sense av i u 0 u 0 z h z for z i and the intersections are transversal if we take an element v u near 0 u 0 in v z 3 r q z the anchor averages are still vanishing but the transversal constraints are not satisfied recall that the constraints associated to z where z does not lie on a trivial cylinder component are r invariant which however is not the case if they lie on trivial cylinder components however by a quite subtle implicit function theorem there exists v a a deformation x of all depending on v u where we recall that a a u so that the associated stabilization deformation sa j v a m a d a sa j v a m x a d a 74 joel w fish and helmut hofer has the property that w w satisfies the transversal constraints and adding suit able constants to the floor we obtain w so that v w belong to v z 3 h r q z again the difficulty in the whole argument arises from the fact that the transversal constraints over trivial cylinder domains are not r invariant theorem 10 4 there exists a g invariant open neighborhood o of q 0 with following properties where oh o v z 3 h r q z 1 we have a well defined sc smooth retraction o o with o oh 2 the retraction in 1 has the following form given q v w o the image v w with a being the underlying total gluing parameter is v w with underlying total gluing parameter a where w w a q v q x a q v q where x a q v q is determined by an implicit functions theorem and as a function of q is sc smooth as a consequence we can make the following crucial definition definition 10 5 assume we are given a stable map and have fixed the auxiliary structures d h and j producing the dm uniformizer g no r at the m data and the sd deformation o u o denote by q 0 the element 0 q 0 v z h r q z where q 0 is the element associated to then a large sd retraction neighborhood is a g invariant open neighborhood o o q 0 in v z r q z as guaranteed by theorem 10 4 in particular there exists an sc smooth retraction o o with image oh this retraction has the form v w v a w v w a v w v x a w v associated to the stabilization deformation 10 4 the uniformizer and transition germs let be an object and pre a pre uniformizer at definition 10 6 a good open neighborhood o of the special element o repre senting is a g invariant open neighborhood of o in v z 3 h r q z having the following properties 1 for v u o we have that v a u belong to o so that the sd deformation o u o is defined where g no r is a good uniformizer for r 2 the restriction of the pre uniformizer to o say is injective on objects and otherwise full and faithful polyfolds and sft 75 3 o oh where o is a large sd retraction neighborhood in the sense of definition 10 5 we define f to be the set of all uniformizers obtained from pre uniformizers by restricting to a good open neighborhood this gives a uniformizer construction then everything is place and from the discussion in this section we obtain a transition germ construction of course it takes some work to verify the required properties 76 joel w fish and helmut hofer lecture 11 11 strong polyfold bundle structure and fredholm theory we have concentrated on the polyfold construction for s the construction of strong bundle structures for functors s ban can be carried out in a similar fashion and we allow ourselves to be brief after having fixed j we have the functor j s ban which associates to an object the t r q valued 0 1 forms of class 2 0 along the stable map figure 22 j s ban the idea is to construct a strong bundle k o and a lift for f fitting into the commutative diagram gnk ej y y gno s figure 23 a slice polyfolds and sft 77 we shall mention the parts we need to also be able to introduce a special class of sc sections which will be used to define the special sc multisection functors used for the perturbation theory 11 1 remarks on construction functors for strong bundles we described the construction of the in great detail and have used a variety of tools to do so in particular we showed that we have a construction functor rn z z 3 r r n z this allowed the extension to manifolds by a general method resulting in z 3 r q z finally having a construction for a manifold q one can introduce transversal constraints and obtain a suitable sub m polyfold z 3 h r q z z 3 r q z in order to obtain a construction for strong complex bundles we again can use the idea of a construction functor more precisely we have a category whose objects are rn kl z where k is either r or c we view rn kl rn as the obvious trivial vector bundle and rn z is a previously considered object namely a collection of weighted periodic orbits in rn the morphisms are smooth maps a rn kl rn kl of the form m f m a m where a m is k linear moreover f rn z rn z is a morphism in the obvious category which was previously introduced the new construction functor is build as follows definition 11 1 we define the sc hilbert space h 2 cl to consist of all continuous maps which associate to z s a complex anti linear map z tzs j cl so that the following holds 1 z 0 for z d 0 k 2 away from points in d 0 k the map z z is of class h 2 loc 3 for every x d 0 k taking positive holomorphic polar coordinates around x the map s t x s belongs to h 2 0 r s 1 cn the sc structure is given by defining level m as regularity 2 m m after fixing a small disk structured we can define x 2 0 0 c l to consist of all maps on the different glued surfaces so that z is complex anti linear is away from nodes of class h 2 loc and has at nodal points or punctures with respect to holomorphic polar coordinates the 2 0 behavior this set can be defined easily by the imprinting method bd h 2 c l x 2 0 0 c l in this case the extraction of gluing parameters is submersive we know also know that the map a z r rn z bd 78 joel w fish and helmut hofer extracting the global gluing parameter is sc smooth we can consider the pull back diagram x 2 0 c l y z 3 r r n z bd we denote the pull back functor by 3 2 r r n cl z z 3 r r n z which is a strong bundle construction functor by using a previous ideas we can use the embedding method to define for the complex vector bundle r tq j q the strong bundle 3 2 r r tq z z 3 r q z here r r tq r q is the complex vector bundle with fiber over a q to consist of all a h b with h r and b tqq with other words we take the pull back of r tq j q by the projection r q q taking transversal constraints for the basis we obtain the pull back diagram 3 2 r r tq z y z 3 h r q z z 3 r q z we denote this pull back bundle by 3 2 h r r tq z z 3 h r q z 19 11 2 incorporating j in the pre uniformizer construction we also fixed a defor mation j v j v v v of j after having fixed a small disk structure d in 19 so far the construction only uses j we define for v v and a gluing parameter a the map v a 1 2 id j j v a tsa j v a tsa ja given u 3 2 r r tq z we see that v a is point wise a complex anti linear map if the domain is equipped with j v a of course here we have that a a u is the underlying gluing parameter given the uniformizer f as previously constructed say g n o s we define the strong bundle p k o i e k by first considering the pull back of 19 by v z 3 h r q z z 3 h r q z 20 polyfolds and sft 79 and then restricting the result to o finally we define the lift of by v u v u v a u the lift of the transition germs for s to e is straight forward as a result we obtain theorem 11 2 the functor which associates to an object the collection f of lifts of uniformizers together with the lift of the transition germ construction f defines metrizable topologies on s and e and viewing the categories as gct s a strong bundle structure for p ej s 11 3 the sc fredholm functor j having the strong bundle construction f s ban we have for an object and f the commutative diagram gnk ej j y p y gno s where j is the local representative theorem 11 3 for every the local representative is sc fredholm i e by definition j is a sc fredholm functor one should mention that in 24 a pre fredholm theory has been developed which is some kind of modular theory which guarantees the fredholm property as a conse quence of smaller pieces of analysis which makes the fredholm theory rather straight forward and most importantly the smaller pieces of analysis can be recycled for new constructions we shall not discuss these ideas here and refer the reader for a detailed discussion to 24 11 4 reflexive local compactness property we know that for every a 0 z the intersection a mj is compact and that j is a sc fredholm functor we begin by stating facts which follow from standard polyfold theory however it should be pointed out that the category of stable maps has additional features which have to be exploited in order to construct sft first we discuss the standard parts of the polyfold theory and the special features will as we shall see add to the fine structure for the perturbation theory the so called reflexive local compactness property will be very important an auxiliary norm n ej 0 is a functor so that for a local strong bundle uniformizer we have that n k 0 is an auxiliary norm the 0 1 fibers of k o are hilbert spaces and therefore reflexive as shown in 47 there is a well defined notion of mixed convergence for sequences in k which in local coordinates corresponds to convergence in o on level 0 and in the 80 joel w fish and helmut hofer fiber to weak convergence in the 0 1 fiber for a comprehensive treatment see 52 we write ki m k if ki converges in this sense the notion also descends to orbit spaces there is a particular important class of auxiliary norm called reflexive auxiliary norms which have the additional property that for a sequence ki k with p ki x in o and liminfi n ki there exists a subsequence such that ki m k for some k p 1 x in the 0 1 fiber with n k liminf n ki if we pass to orbit space e it still makes sense to talk about mixed convergence and n defines a map n which restricted to e 0 1 is continuous and verifies the obvious version of the mixed convergence requirement the final goal in this lecture is to state important local results for f j recall the abbreviation z s theorem 11 4 for every reflexive auxiliary norm n with associated n e 0 the following holds given a point z z there exists an open neighborhood u z with the property that clz y u z n f y 1 is compact the other result we need is the following proposition 11 5 assume that f z 1 then there exists an open neighbor hood u z such that f y 1 for all y u z proof arguing indirectly we find a sequence zk converging to z in z and liminif n f zk 1 we deduce that without loss of generality we may assume that f zk m k e 0 1 which also implies f zk k in e 0 0 hence 1 n f z n k 1 giving a contradiction polyfolds and sft 81 lecture 12 12 accommodation of special features 12 1 a strong ssc bundle recall that and have a floor structure we intro duced the open subset o of 0 1 k z 3 r r n z in definition 8 2 recall the sc hilbert space h 2 cl introduced in definition 11 1 recall that d denotes all nodal pairs occurring on floors and bd the manifold of associated gluing parameters then bd o h 2 c l o is a strong ssc bundle we recall that there is a sc smooth map associating the a r 1 rk u the global admissible gluing parameter a a a r 1 rk u see definition 8 4 since we started with a stable map in s we can distinguish between different types of domain components definition 12 1 let be a stable map in s and the underlying riemann surface with floor structure a domain component c of is a trivial cylinder component provided it harbors a trivial cylinder as part of all other components are called nontrivial components 12 2 adapted auxiliary norm recall the strong bundle 3 2 r r r n cl z z 3 r r n z which comes from the pull back diagram x 2 0 c l y z 3 r r n cl z bd the horizontal arrow has its image in the admissible gluing parameters we shall introduce a map n x 2 0 c l 0 with suitable properties each domain component has a a floor number coming from the original data given the gluing parameter a we have the associated domain a on the core region we define the weight function w 1 on an unglued trivial cylinder segment define w on an unglued disk associated to a nodal point we extend w by w e 1 s using positive holomorphic polar coordinates on a glued disk pair associated to a nodal pair biholomorphic to 0 r s 1 we set w s t min e 1 s e 1 r s for a puncture associated to 0 k we take the weight e 1 s for positive holomorphic polar coordinates 82 joel w fish and helmut hofer for an unglued puncture pair where each of the punctures does not belong to a trivial cylinder domain we take on the disks the weight e 1 s for a glued puncture pair where each of the punctures does not belong to a trivial cylinder domain we take on the glued disks which is biholomorphic to 0 r s 1 the weight min e 1 s e 1 r s the remaining cases consist of looking at maximal chains of glued trivial cylinder components and we can distinguish between four cases trivial cylinder domain disk on a nontrivial domain around negative puncture disk on a nontrivial domain around positive puncture indicates that glued 1 2 3 4 figure 24 configurations involving trivial cylinder domains in case 1 we have a finite sequence of glued trivial cylinder components which of course itself is a new trivial cylinder component we take the weight w in case 2 we have at the top a disk around a negative puncture and otherwise glued trivial cylinder components we just extend the weight w e 1 s on the disk with respect to negative holomorphic polar coordinates in case 3 similarly a disk around positive puncture followed by glued trivial cylinder components here we extend w e 1 s finally in case 4 two disks at a positive and negative puncture respectively and at least one glued trivial cylinder component in between in this case we have two extensions of the weight functions associated to negative positive holomorphic polar coordinates on the disk say e 1 s negative s r 0 and e 1 s positive s 0 r with the relation r s s we define the weight function min e 1 r s e 1 s polyfolds and sft 83 these choices define for fixed a a weight function wa then we consider h on sa and use the weighted h 3 norm to obtain h 2 sa this expressions define n 3 2 0 n a r 1 rk u h 21 we note that if r 1 rk 0 and n a r 1 rk u h then h necessarily vanishes on trivial cylinder components definition 12 2 we shall call n a penalizing adapted auxiliary norm and for short a ps norm compared to the usual definition of auxiliary norm it can take on non zero vectors on the 0 1 fiber the value the definition of n depends on choices however when we construct n making different choices there exists a constant c 0 such that c n n 1 c n this is the local picture invoking the embedding method and strong bundle uniformizers we can define n e 0 if we obtain n and n this way there will be a continuous functor f is continuous f s 0 satisfying f n n 1 f n 22 with other words we obtain a class of model ps norms which show the compatibility as in 22 for certain f we can then consider abstract ps norms with the obvious expected properties and which can be sandwiched between model ps norms definition 12 3 a general ps norm is a functor n e 0 having the following properties 0 for a suitable continuous functor f s 0 and a model ps norm n it holds f n n 1 f n 1 n e 0 is a functor and for a given object the subset of e with n e is a vector space and the restriction of n to it is a complete norm 2 if kj j ej m k e then n e liminf n j ej 3 if n kj is bounded and the underlying zj converges then there exists a mixed convergent subsequence 4 n e if there exists a nontrivial cylinder component on which e is nonzero 84 joel w fish and helmut hofer 5 n e 0 1 0 is continuous where 0 is equipped with the topology of the 1 point compactification the ps norms can be constructed by a continuous partitions of unity using that z is metrizable 12 3 special sc section having the ps norms at hand we can introduce the sc sections we are interested in we go back to the model where we defined n locally see 21 consider a sc section f of 3 1 h z 3 h we say that f vanishes strongly near special points i e punctures and nodal points provided for every u there exists an open neighborhood u of the set of punctures in 0 k the unglued nodal pairs and the unglued interface puncture pairs defining in an obvious sense open subsets of the glued surfaces denoted by ua for a a u and u near u such that for u near u the element f u vanishes on the just constructed neighborhoods definition 12 4 consider an sc section f of our strong bundle defined over an open subset u of the base space bd o we say f is special provided the following holds 1 n f a r 1 rk u 2 f vanishes strongly near special points the definition of special sc sections does not depend on the choices involved by the previously stated facts 12 4 special sc multisection functors we have introduced the notion of a special sc section just using such sc sections we can defined define associated sc multisection functors and which we shall call special sc multisection definition 12 5 a functor e q 0 1 is called a special sc multisection functor provided for an object and f there exists an open g invariant neighborhood u of o o and a finite set of special sc sections si i i of p k o defined over u together with an action g on i satisfying sg i g o g si o for o u g g such that for k k with p k u it holds k 1 i i i si p k k polyfolds and sft 85 we note that this only has to be tested by a set of so that the associated u have the property that u cover z these sc multisections are easy to construct when we have sc smooth partitions of unity which happens to be the case in our application for this fix any smooth object and take f say gnk e pick an invariant open neighborhood u of o such that clz u o then for given smooth vector e ko which vanishes on trivial cylinder segments as well as near punctures and nodal points we find an special sc section with support in u and s o e then move this around by g to obtain sg define over k by k 1 g g g sg p k k generally if there exists a morphism e k for some k k define e k if no such morphism exists define e 0 e there are several operations which are important 1 e e e e e e convolution sum 2 for a sc smooth functor s r define by e 0 e if 0 and otherwise by e 1 e this is called rescaling they also behave well with respect to proper coverings which we need but shall not discuss further the upshot of this discussion is that there are many special sc multisections to address all occurring transversality questions however for inductive constructions we need extension theorems for sc multisection functors defined on the boundary with the definition given above such extension theorems might not exist and the problems are discussed in detail in 43 what we need is a subclass of special sc multisection functors which is rich enough to achieve transversality and also admits a controlled extension result the notions which are important are that of structured or structurable sc multisections introduced in 52 and that of v structured or v structurable sc multisection functors introduced in 43 in particular 43 contains a discussion of the relationships between different notions in fact the notions of being structurable and being v structurable are equivalent whereas a structure or a v structure being quite different concepts moreover there are enough special sc multisections to achieve transversality 12 5 the strong topology t on z the strong topology has to be seen in connection with the special type of sc sections and multisections we are going to use we shall describe t in detail in 24 and restrict ourselves to describe the properties of the topology t 86 joel w fish and helmut hofer 1 for a parent a p 0 z the sets z a z dz z 0 and z a dz z 0 are the same the topologies t and t restricted to z a dz z 1 coincide 2 given z z say z a where a 0 z there exists an open t neighborhood u u z a and a ps norm n defined on eclz u z with the following prop erty where f j and n is induced by n given zk clz u z with n f zk 1 there exists a convergent subsequence with respect to t ev ery such convergent subsequence also converges with respect to t and in particular the limit belongs to z clz u z property 2 essentially characterizes t this topology will be discussed in detail in 24 polyfolds and sft 87 part 5 perturbation and transversality theory we shall describe the ingredients of a perturbation and transversality theory in detail lecture 13 13 inductive compactness control the perturbation theory will proceed inductively and sft will exhibit some of the more subtle aspects which one can encounter in these kind of problems we shall consider here the case of a closed manifold q equipped with a non degenerate contact form i e q d in this case we can organize the induction rather than with respect to dj in a different way which is less demanding in its constructive aspects standing assumption from now on q d is a non degenerate contact form the consequence of this assumption is the following proposition 13 1 for every a 0 z it holds that d a max dz z z a with other words every connected component only has a finite number of faces this does not hold in general for the stable hamiltonian case definition 13 2 the complexity is the map d 0 z 0 1 2 a d a defined by d a max dz z z a 13 1 preparation we describe the ingredients notions and procedures which are part of an inductive construction which produces tools for a quantitative control of compactness definition 13 3 given a subset a of z we denote by sa the full subcategory associated to objects having isomorphism class in a further we define ea to be the full subcategory associated to all e with being an object in sa we need the following notion definition 13 4 let a z be a closed subset for t a functor n a ea 0 is said to be auxiliary norm like provided for every object with a the following holds 88 joel w fish and helmut hofer 1 n a e n a e where we use the convention 0 for 0 and for 0 2 n a e e n a e n a e where we use the convention that c for c 0 3 if n a e then e belongs to e 0 1 i e is on the 0 1 bi level 4 for fixed a n a restricted to the vector space of all e e n a e is a complete norm when considering an auxiliary norm like functor n a it will frequently occur that it behaves on certain parts of ea as a ps norm i e having some continuity properties with respect to the appropriate notion capturing this behavior is given as follows definition 13 5 let a be a closed subset of z t assume that n a ea 0 is an auxiliary norm like functor we say that n a is ps like over a provided n a ea 0 is a ps norm we shall constructed inductively o pen i e open with respect to t neighborhoods u mj u z with suitable properties so that with a clz u we can also construct a ps norm over a i e n a ea 0 again with suitable properties definition 13 6 assume that a 0 z we say a pair u a n a controls com pactness of j provided the following holds 1 u a a is an o pen neighborhood of a mj in z and n a ecl z u a 0 a ps norm 2 if n a j 1 and clz u a then u a 3 the closure of all u a in z with n a j 1 is compact in z 4 if zk is a sequence in clz u a with the property that liminfk n a j k 1 where k zk then hk hk j k has a mixed convergent subse quence hk m h and n a h liminf n a hk moreover the underlying zk of this subsequence converges in t the inductive procedure is done with respect to the elements in 0 z 0 1 2 here 0 z a 0 z d a we construct o pen sets u a t and ps norms n a ecl u a 0 for a 0 z with d a so that n a is ps like over clz u a and u a n a controls compactness of polyfolds and sft 89 j the inductive step then uses the construction for to extend it to data a for d a 1 by keeping the data for and adding the new data for a with d a 1 choices during the constructions have to be made for a p 0 z with d a 1 then the constructions for a d 0 z u 0 z with d a 1 are canonically we need some additional input for carrying out the inductive constructions 13 2 compactness and extension results we shall describe two features which are important in inductive steps which occur later on when we construct an open neighborhood u ofmj with suitable properties and a ps norm n ncl z u 0 such that u n controls compactness and moreover when we construct compatible special sc multisection functors proposition 11 5 and some considerations about j lead to the following version where we note that a ps norm defined on ea for a closed subset z of z can always be extended to e theorem 13 7 for every ps norm n with associated n e 0 the following holds given a point z z there exists an o pen neighborhood u z with the property that cl z y u z n f y 1 is compact with respect to t suppose we are given a parent class a 0 z with d a max dz z z a 0 we know that a mj is compact we can fix a ps norm n a ea 0 employing the previous theorem and the compactness of a mj in z t we can find finitely many points z 1 zj and u zi such that u j i 1 u zi a mj is an o pen covering and for every i 1 j it holds that cl z y u zi n f y 1 is compact with respect to t then the same holds for u i e cl z y u n f y 1 is compact we observe that c inf n f z z u 0 indeed otherwise we find z u such that n f z 0 and after taking a subsequence we may assume that z z u and that f z m where is the class of the zero vector above z i e f z 0 which gives a contradiction since u mj take an o pen neighborhood v of a mj with cl v u we can take a continuous function cl z u 1 which on v takes the value 1 and on u a value greater than 2 c the defines a continuous functor s cl z u 1 and we can define a new reflexive auxiliary norm by n n over cl u then n f z 1 for some z u implies 1 n f z z n f z z c 2 giving a contradiction 90 joel w fish and helmut hofer i e the elements satisfying n f z 1 and z cl z u belong to u hence we have shown the following theorem 13 8 given a parent class a p 0 z with d a 0 there exists an o pen neighborhood u of a mj and a ps norm defined over clz u such that u a n a controls compactness we need an extension result along the same line theorem 13 9 assume that a p 0 z and u a is an o pen neighborhood of a mj in a and n is a ps norm defined over clz u a such that u a n a controls compactness then there exists an o pen neighborhood u a of a mj and a ps norm n a defined over clz u a so that following holds 1 the restriction of u a n a to the boundary is u a n a 2 u a n a controls compactness 13 3 main assertion in this subsection we shall state the basic result about compactness control theorem 13 10 for every a 0 z there exists u a t which contains a mj and a ps norm n a ecl z u a 0 so that the following property p holds for every 0 where we define u n and e ea a d a a as follows u a 0 z d a u a n e cl z u 0 with n e cl z u a n a d a p for every a 0 z 1 u a n a controls compactness 2 for a 0 z where d a the following holds namely for 0 b 1 b k k in s a z the statement u is equivalent to the statement i c u for i 0 k and c ntriv 0 s i 3 for e 0 e 0 b 1 b k k ek with cl z u a the following holds if for some i 0 k the map ei is non zero on some trivial cylinder segment it holds that n e otherwise n e maxki 0 maxc ntriv 0 s i n i c ei ci polyfolds and sft 91 we see that the statement suggests an inductive construction with respect to the elements a 0 z 13 4 inductive construction we use the complexity d 0 z 0 1 for the induction meaning that we construct in the th step starting with 0 u a n a for a 0 z a 0 z d a using data associated to 1 0 z and new choices 0 0 p we consider a p 0 z with d a 0 we find a ps norm n over sa and a strong o pen neighborhood u a of a mj such that u a n a controls compactness here n a is the restriction of n to clz u a we note that in this case u a t as well and n a is taken over a as a reflexive auxiliary norm 0 d we consider a d 0 z with d a 0 and parent a we take an o pen subset u a of a mj with parent u a and n a with parent n a then u a n a controls compactness 0 u we note that u 0 z does not contain an element with d a 0 we define u 0 a 0 z d a 0 u a and obtain n 0 so that u 0 n 0 has the obvi ous properties by construction p 0 holds we do also the case 1 before giving the general step two new complications enter the first is that we need to extend neighborhoods on the boundary together with a ps norm to the interior so that compactness is controlled the second issue is concerned with union classes this is the point which makes the use of special sc sections necessary 1 in this case we have boundaries but no corners the boundary faces come with covering functors s s p s c b b the class c determines classes a a with 1 d a d a d a 1 where a so that in particular da da 0 92 joel w fish and helmut hofer 1 p we take the parent class a with d a 1 since u a and u a are already given by the step 0 one can define u to consist of all b with u a and u a the elements in the closure of u consists of all with and belonging to the respective closures the union of all u is by definition u a i e u a facea u we define n a over the closure of u as follows over the relevant parts of the face a n a e b e max n a e n a e it is evident that u a n a controls compactness using the extension result we can extend n a to a ps norm n a and an o pen neighborhood of a mj such that u a n a controls compactness 1 p the extension of the data to a descendent is obvious i e as in the case 0 1 u this time we also have union classes and start with a union parent let a be the union parent since d a 1 it follows that for an object with d 0 and a it holds ntriv 0 s 0 s 2 the following figure 25 illustrates this disjoint union parent figure 25 an element of union parent type of height 1 configurations representing elements in a look as in the following figure 26 we note that the data from 0 determines not only data for a but also for a a a for the boundary we can define as before n a and u a the natural definition over polyfolds and sft 93 figure 26 occurring configurations in the boundary the cylinders are trivial cylinders but not necessarily j holomorphic however in the intersection a z such configurations only have j holomorphic cylinders a is u a which consists of elements z so that the associated two satisfy u 0 further n a e max nac c ec c 0 s ntriv 0 s we define u a u a u a with these two natural definitions we obtain a functor n a ecl z u a 0 which is auxiliary norm like proposition 13 11 u a is o pen containsmj n a is a ps norm and u a n a controls compactness the fact that n a is a ps norm would generally not be true for an open neighbor hood of a mj in z the reason is that it would in general not have the required continuity properties next follows the general argument 1 assuming p we shall show that choices can be made so that p 1 holds so by assumption we have n a and u a given for all a 0 z where u a n a controls compactness and n over cl z u a is a ps norm further some additional properties as previously listed hold in order to prepare for the argument we carry out some preparations the data associated to determines certain data for all a with d a 1 which has to be derived first important ingredients are the covering functors s s p s c b b 94 joel w fish and helmut hofer the class c determines classes a a with d a d a d a 1 where a if u a and u a are given one can define u to consist of all b with u and u assume that facea are different and intersect then we have two functors s s p s p s given by b b b b b b 23 b b b b b b this associativity has some important consequences for example given u a u a and u a it will follow that u u we have the following consequence proposition 13 12 the set u a defined for some a 0 z with d a 1 by u a facea u is o pen in z a and n a is a ps auxiliary norm over cl u a on the boundary and u a n a controls compactness on the boundary now we are in the position to discuss the different cases parent we can extend for a p 0 z with d a 1 the data u n a to a pair u a n a controlling compactness and restricting on the boundary to the given one descendant for a descendent a with d a 1 let a be the associated parent the data u a n a is obtained from u a n a in the previously i e case discussed way union let us consider an union parent class a with d a 1 if a is the union of a 1 ae we must have the identity 2 d a 1 e i 1 d ai 1 and ntriv 0 s 0 s 2 the second inequality is by definition and the equality can be seen as follows and generalizing the contents of the figure 7 indeed for each i 1 e we can take a configuration with with degeneracy being maximal i e d ai and from which we can polyfolds and sft 95 extract d ai 1 many parent pieces lining all this pieces up suitably by using trivial cylinder segments we can construct an element representing a satisfying d 1 e i 1 d ai 1 24 it is easy to see that for this specific element d d a because otherwise we obtain a contradiction to the value of the expression on the right hand side of 24 we construct new data in terms of data in lower grading assume that a has underlying parent classes a 1 ae it holds d a 1 e i 1 d ai 1 we define with a a a the o pen subset u a of a to consists of all z with the underlying c u for c ntriv 0 z and we define u a as the union over all faces facea of the sets u which are obtained by using the associated proper covering functors finally we define u a u a u a lemma 13 13 the set u is o pen and contains a mj using n we can define n a on clz u a by n a e if e is nonzero on a trivial cylinder component and otherwise by n a e max k i 0 maxc ntriv 0 s i n i c ei c proposition 13 14 n a ecl u a 0 is a ps norm and u a n a controls com pactness if a is a union descendent and a the underlying parent there is the standard ex tension u a n a using the data u a n a finally we set u 1 as the union of u and all u a with d a 1 further we define n 1 in the obvious way the induction is complete at this point we have constructed a system of o pen neighborhoods u a a 0 z and ps norms n a defined on e cl z u so that for every a the pair u a n a controls in a quantitative way compactness at this point we are ready to begin with the perturbation and transversality theory 96 joel w fish and helmut hofer lecture 14 14 perturbation theory the standard question of extending a multisection from a boundary with corners to the interior did not get the attention it deserved in fact the problem is subtle in 52 an abstract method in the polyfold framework is given and the method is further refined in 43 for applications in inductive procedures the difficulty of ex tending multisections was also observed in 34 but seem not to have been adequately addressed previously see 28 29 specifically page 479 but also the introduction con cerning 35 more details about the general difficulties are given in jake solomons lecture 81 in this section we shall carry out the perturbation based on special sc multi sections which we have introduced previously their basic feature boils down to a growth condition related to j holomorphic cylinder segments and which also vanish near nodal points and punctures in a suitable way 14 1 main perturbation result recall from the previous section u n where u t is an o pen neighborhood of m in z t and n e cl z u 0 is a ps norm further when u a defines the intersection of a with u we have the property that u a n a controls compactness of j theorem 14 1 let u n control compactness given 0 1 there exists a special sc multisection functor e u 0 1 q which has the following properties 1 satisfies e id e d i 0 c ntriv 0 s i i c ei c 2 n and consequently for every a 0 z the set a supp j is a compact subset contained in a u 3 j are in general position over u and s u 0 1 q is a weighted tame branched orbifold so that supp intersected with each a is compact polyfolds and sft 97 14 2 extension result as already mentioned there is more to the extension re sults than it seems and the relevant reference is 43 the essential message from 43 is that for any reasonable class of sc sections one can define a class of sc multisections let us call them good for the moment being good is invariant under standard operations like pull backs by proper covering maps and moreover a good sc section on the boundary has a good extension further for inductive proofs very often the following occurs which we also have seen in our application in the inductive step one constructs using previous data new data on the faces and it is important that if faces intersect the data on these intersections coincides this should of course be also true for the overhead i e the goodness whatever that means in a given context therefore in general there has to be some localization of the notion of being good to the boundary for example the realization of such a good system in 43 has all these properties in general there might be many different realizations of good systems of multisections the issues we just raised are of course very important but unfortunately require a larger amount of time be explained properly we refer to the lecture by jake solomon and the upcoming 43 everything we describe now can be carried out this way but to be a complete proof it requires to carry some overhead through the induction we require the reader to be familiar with the usual finite dimensional transversality theory as well as parameterized versions see for example 38 or 2 the basic fact about perturbations by multisections based on a class of sections is that what ever can be achieved in the case without symmetries by a perturbation using the given class can be achieved in the case of symmetries by a multisection this is the guiding principle 14 3 induction by the previous discussion we have a pair u n controlling com pactness and this data satisfies certain compatibility conditions the perturbation is constructed by induction with respect to d a for the given 0 1 we pick a sequence 0 0 1 i i 1 define a a 0 z d a a and u u a and n n e cl z u induction statement assume there exists for some 0 1 2 a special sc multisection functor e u 0 1 q having the following properties 1 j is in general position over u 98 joel w fish and helmut hofer 2 the coarse moduli space supp associated to u 0 1 q j intersected with every a 0 z d a is compact 3 n for u 4 e 0 id e d i 0 c ntriv 0 s i i c ei c then there exists 1 e u 1 0 1 q which satisfies 0 1 e u 1 1 j is in general position over u 1 2 the coarse moduli space associated to 1 u 0 1 q 1 1 j when intersected with a 0 z d a 1 is compact 3 n 1 1 1 for u 1 4 1 e 0 id e d i 0 c ntriv 0 s i 1 i c ei c 0 we pick a parent class a 0 z and take a defined over u a such that n a 0 for u a and so that j a is in general position over u a then the perturbed moduli space is a compact branched weighted orbifold next pick a descendent class a d 0 z with d a 0 and parent a we define a over u a by a e 0 id e a c ec here c is the unique nontrivial component we note that n a a 0 there are no disjoint union classes the data defines a 0 e u 0 0 1 q which is in general position to j further the solution set is compact without boundary and defines a tame branched weighted orbifold it holds that n 0 for in s u 0 1 assume has been constructed with the previously described properties parent pick a parent class a 0 z with d a 1 for every face facea we can use the proper covering functor and pull back data from the fibered prod uct which only involves data from the case it defines 1 on e u 1 then polyfolds and sft 99 n 1 1 for with u 1 then an extension result gives a de fined on u a with n 1 a 1 and u a descendant this is automatic from the previous choices union also automatic finally we define 1 e u 1 0 1 q by setting it equal to on e u and for a 0 z with d a 1 we define it as a the induction is complete and this proves the existence of a general position e u 0 1 q 14 4 conclusion we summarize where we stand at this point starting with a pair u controlling compactness we have constructed a special sc multisection e u 0 1 q satisfying n 1 for all objects satisfying u moreover j is in general position over u as a consequence we obtain the moduli category supp which consists of all objects in s u with j 0 for these properties it follows that the associated orbit space m supp the coarse moduli spaces has the property that for every a 0 z the intersection ma a m is compact further is of tame branched weighted orbifold type let us define a as the restriction of to sa since has the property e id e d i 0 c ntriv 0 s i i c ei c there are many relationships between the different a denote by z the orbit space of the full subcategory associated to all stable maps without marked points clearly z is the union of all a coming from a suitable subset of 0 z we also have a decomposition of into parent descendant and union classes we can associate to each a an integer ind a which is the fredholm index of j over a we observe the following theorem proposition 14 2 for a union class a with ma 6 it holds ind a 1 100 joel w fish and helmut hofer lecture 15 15 orientations a good source for the orientation question is 84 which follows general ideas as given in 6 14 20 for the discussion we use the set up of the orientation questions for the sc fredholm problem for e s associated to j which can be viewed as a lift of the problem ej s recall the definition of s from subsection 2 5 remark 15 1 1 we also point out that there is an alternative way where we use the functor j s u 0 1 q which is of tame branched weighted orbifold type and by adding asymptotic marked and numberings of top and bottom punctures construct a finite to one covering of it on which we deal with the orientation questions 2 another possible way is to start right from the beginning with e s and use the functorial actions of rotating markers and renumbering which are defined on the respective subcategories then the perturbation theory has to be compatible with these actions 15 1 lift to e s recall that e is the pull back of e s by the forgetful functor which is a proper covering functor s s passing to orbit space we obtain s s and denote the preimage of u by u then s u corresponds to s u under the proper covering functor we also pull back the previously constructed to obtain e u 0 1 q this sc multisection together with the cr operator is in general position and the weighted moduli category j is a proper covering of j the new set up has some advantages concerning the orientation question remark 15 2 one should be able to construct the sft potential directly for the original set up in the context of coarse moduli spaces there is a discussion related to this point in 84 15 2 linearisations for the orientation question the following considerations are important assume that and are two smooth objects in s which lie over the same object in s via the proper covering we have three associated linearization spaces namely lin j lin j lin j there are natural bijections between these spaces lin j lin j lin j polyfolds and sft 101 so that a given l t s e corresponds to a l t s e and a l t s e note that the targets are all the same we can use this to push forward an orientation of l to an orientation of l and then to l hence we can compare orientations under the change of numbering of positive or negative punctures the change of numbering of marked points as well as rotation of asymptotic markers a so called coherent orientation would give orientations to the linearization spaces lin j satisfying some rules however there are some subtleties associated to so called bad orbits we shall discuss some of the issues in the next subsection 15 3 conley zehnder index and parity we start with t 0 1 which is a prime periodic orbit i e k 1 so that t 0 is the minimal period then t 0 r and with x 0 we obtain the linearized return map a x x associated to t 0 1 the linearized return map associated to k t 0 k is ak the non degeneracy assumption implies that 1 6 am for all m 1 in particular 1 6 a since a is symplectic the real eigenvalues appear in pairs 1 r 1 1 we can count the number e of eigenvalues in 1 0 with multiplicity definition 15 3 a periodic orbit t k is bad provided k is even and e associ ated to t k 1 is odd denote by c 1 c 1 the first chern number of the contact structure associated to then the conley zehnder index is defined in z 2 c 1 and we have the parity relation 1 cz t k n 1 sign det id a t k definition 15 4 given a periodic orbit t k we define a number in z 2 0 1 called parity by parity t k cz t k n 3 mod 2 15 4 orientation bundle the notion of coherent orientation is well known see 20 6 84 we shall not go into precise details but describe how it looks in the current formalism we consider now e s for every smooth object there exists the contractible space of linearizations of lin j which is a convex set of linear sc fredholm operators l t s e over the convex set of fredholm operators we have the associated determinant bundle with two possible orientations as a consequence we have the following gadget where s is the subcategory of smooth objects o r s we can view o r as the category with objects o where o is an orientation of the family of sc fredholm operators in lin j a morphism defines o o s o t 102 joel w fish and helmut hofer proposition 15 5 given a smooth its isotropy group g acts on o r in an ori entation preserving way next we introduce the notion that two smooth objects are related by a path and similarly if they are equipped with orientations definition 15 6 we say two smooth objects are related by a path if there exists a third object and f say g n o s and a sc smooth path 0 1 o with 0 and 1 if o and o are given we say that they are related by a path provided and are related by a path and the prolongation of the orientation o along gives o the cauchy riemann section functor defines for an orientation bundle over o so that the the prolongation of the orientation along a path is well defined see 52 for the precise argument in view of proposition 15 5 we can pass to orbit space and we obtain a z 2 bundle over the metrizable space z say o z where z s and z is the metrizable space of smooth points we shall call it orientation bundle if a 0 z we can restrict the orientation bundle to a and denote this restriction by o a theorem 15 7 for every class a 0 z the restricted orientation bundle o a is orientable this is a good start but still not enough for constructing sft in fact what we need is a system of orientations which is compatible in a precise sense for this we need some preparation given a smooth object in the interior of a face of s we can consider the space of linearizations of j and take a representative l 1 then the restriction l to the tangent space of the face at can be related to a specific product of linearizations via the proper covering map pick a convention here assume for simplicity l is surjective in the general case there is a formula then 2 the kernel of l will have a vector h which is outward pointing we write the orientation of l in terms of h as a first vector followed by those in the kernel of l tensored by the cokernel this allows to use the concatenation structure to define a notion of something like a coherent orientation see 84 6 20 it is particularly important to understand the rules which have to be implemented when renumbering periodic orbits as well as rotation asymptotic markers this is discussed in detail in 84 polyfolds and sft 103 15 5 remark about invariants at this point we would be able to introduce the hamiltonian h introduced in 14 and prove its property h h 0 if using closed forms or more generally dh h h 0 one can follow 14 we intend to expand this lecture note to a graduate text which would cover this specialists know at this point know what to do and beginning graduate students find details in 84 or 14 for example if q is simply connected and the first chern class of the contact structure vanishes we can take for every periodic orbit t k a cap and compute the cz index with respect to an associated trivialization every periodic orbit will have a well defined cz index since under our assumption the result is independent of the choices given a stable map we can glue in the caps and we obtain second homology class a h 2 q z consider a parent class a p 0 z and take a non nodal representative and glue in the caps this allows to associate to a a second homology class a the genus of the underlying domain the positive asymptotic periodic orbits and the negative asymptotic periodic orbits we have the evaluations functors at the marked points which can be used to pull back differential forms on q to sc smooth differential forms on s see 52 for the underlying theory similarly we have a forgetful functor into dm space associating to a stable map the stable part of the underlying domain we can define so called correlators by integrating certain expressions over moduli spaces having no bad orbits bundling these expressions suitably see 14 we obtain the so called hamiltonian the orientation properties imply h h 0 for a suitably defined 104 joel w fish and helmut hofer lecture 16 16 homotopy we go back to e s and investigate the relationship between u n and u n where and are transversal to j define u u u and equip with n max n n we can find a transversal u n such that the solutions associated to j in u belong to u we can do the same for u n the upshot is that we may assume without loss of generality that n n and u u 16 1 set up we consider the category s 0 1 0 1 s equipped with the pull back bundle still denoted by e we denote the transversal perturbations by 0 and 1 compactness is not really the issue since it is guaranteed provided the perturbations are small enough the set controlling compactness will be 0 1 u and the ps norm is n on e t e provided clz u we again proceed inductively using d and the parent descendent and union classification of classes in 0 z we have a projection t 0 1 s 0 1 whatever the extension is of 0 t 1 it will be transversal to the boundaries 0 s t 1 s recall that as part of the inductive procedure already in the second step we consider boundary faces and pull back data associated to some a a which we dealt with in the previous step this time we have to deal with with families a t t i and a t t i and we have to take a fibered product with respect to t this of course works if t is a submersion on at least one of the moduli spaces not surprisingly this can generally not be expected one can get away with somewhat less assumptions than that but it is still not feasible in our case however there is a simple trick to achieve this which can be adapted from kuranishi framework see 30 31 32 33 in the last reference particularly section 7 the issue in these references is the same since it involves fibered product constructions remark 16 1 the idea is a logical consequence of understanding the problems which went into the decision to use multisections when dealing with problems having local symmetries symmetries generally obstruct transversality to deal with this rather than considering 0 j 0 supported on the zero section we considered a suitable small perturbation j where we recall e e 1 for every fixed we broke the symmetry by a perturbation but then took a symmetric family of problems locally by using a symmetric family of perturbations each problem in the finite family is allocated an appropriate weight or alternatively we average over the problems one introduces a notion when two such local families coincide locally and polyfolds and sft 105 consequently obtains a notion of a global problem usually homological information over q will be preserved when we deal with the homotopy problem the issue arises from the diagonal in i i due to the t projection i the empty bered product for two zero dimenional spaces since they project onto di erent points in i i the bered product for a zero dimenional and a one dimensional spaces i the bered product for two one dimensional spaces figure 27 some of the fibered product issues namely we have to consider boundaries obtained by concatenation of descendants of the same parent which are essentially perturbed in the same way similarly there is a problem when considering disjoint unions a model for the issues is a taking a fibered product of two identical situations in this case the fibered product construction fails in general indeed we need that if we have an element in the fibered product then at least one of the t projections is submersive near the appropriate points in a first naive attempt we can try a family of homotopies say 100 sections in sufficiently general position producing 100 different solution spaces with maps to 0 1 when we take a fibered product of the problem with itself but use different pairs of homotopies in our 100 100 collection of pairs we obtain 10000 homotopies of which 100 have the diagonal problem hence roughly speaking 9900 are good compared to 100 bad ones of course taking the limit in the number of such homotopies to infinity the percentage of bad problems with respect to the overall problems goes potentially to 106 joel w fish and helmut hofer 0 of course still the bad problems could spoil the algebraic averages and there is no proof along these lines which gets away with a finite number of sections however the idea works for smooth families together with an averaging provided we set things up appropriately coming back to the sft problem the right implementation of this idea is to take suitable smooth families of special sc multisection functors we also have a class of such sc multisections for which we have extension theorems but we shall not discuss this here the discussion in 52 and in the forth coming paper 43 can be generalized to this parameter depending context here is what we do define i 1 1 and let 1 1 0 be a map with the following properties 1 is smooth with compact support in 1 1 2 s s 0 3 1 1 s ds 1 then we obtain the compactly supported one form 1 s ds we define in as the n fold product and also we put n s 1 sn ds 1 dsn the special sc multisections we are interested in can be viewed as maps which associate to s in a family of special sc multisection functors of the strong polyfold bundle or alternatively as a sc multisection functor over in 0 1 s by pulling back e s via the obvious projection hence given and strong bundle uniformizer gnk e we can write idin 0 1 s t k 1 i i i si s t p k k for s in and all k k with p k near o in order to have extension theorems we need to add some additional conditions which we shall suppress and which are similar to those in the non parameterized case there is an obvious operation to extend the parameter space given namely we just multiply the domain with some additional ik with parameters which however are ineffective we shall refer to this as the trivial enrichment a quick example without symmetry assume that p e m is a smooth oriented vector bundle over a connected smooth oriented manifold without boundary so that dim m dim em and that a m i is a submersion denoted by the thom form then m f e p where e p is the euler number if f is transversal to the zero section f 1 0 consists of finitely many points and s f 1 0 i is nowhere a submersion again starting polyfolds and sft 107 with the given f in the previous discussion we can defined f in m e by f s m f m taking a sufficiently large n we find a small perturbation f of f such that 1 f 1 0 is a smooth manifold of dimension n 2 a f 1 0 0 1 is a submersion we do not claim that the map in 2 is surjective or proper however we note that f 1 0 in is proper then we consider the compactly supported form a n f on in m of degree n dimm we note that in m a n f e p this is some kind of averaging hence by passing from f to f we did not lose the euler class information but gained the additional property that f 1 0 i is a submersion which could be used for further constructions more precisely in our sft case before we actually carry out the integration over in i e the averaging we can make further constructions for example fibered product constructions and only at the very end we average using the accumulated averaging parameters 16 2 consequences of compactness control recall that we work with u n controlling compactness assume that we are given a small perturbation in the sense that n s t 1 we denote for a 0 z by ia the finite product ina we assume that for a 0 z defines a ia 0 1 eu a 0 1 q by s t e s t e next we consider a ia 0 1 su a 0 1 q s t s t j consider the moduli category which is generated by the objects s t on which a is positive and take its orbit space denoted by ma then ma ia is a proper map i e the preimage of a compact subset of ia is compact if we take the dimension ia large enough we can achieve that the t projection into 0 1 is a submersion not necessarily onto 108 joel w fish and helmut hofer 16 3 the perturbation scheme all the perturbations are assumed to be small which can be measured by u n the key is to take enough parameters the organization of the perturbation scheme is the same as the one already used and previously discussed 0 we start with a p 0 z and d a 0 we can find a with parameter set ia ina extending the corresponding trivial enrichment of 0 a and 1 a we can do this in such a way that j is in general positive and the projection onto 0 1 is a submersion this perturbation extends trivially to descendants and there are no union classes 1 we start again with a parent a p 0 z and assume d a 1 pick a face and recall that two different faces are disjoint the face corresponds to a a the relevant set u consists of all b such that u a and u a and using the proper covering functor we define a ia ia 0 1 eu q 0 1 by a s s t e b e a s t e a s t e the moduli subcategory of s associated to j is precisely a fibered product with respect to the submersive t projections we do this for every face and then ex tend and perhaps we need to use a trivial enrichment over the boundary of course this extension has to be done carefully in order to obtain transversality the submer sion property and preservation of compactness then we extend to descendants in a trivial way the disjoint union is given by the standard formula and automatically has the desired properties 1 the construction proceeds in the obvious way 16 4 concluding remarks finally we can lift everything to s and introduce ori entations then everything proceeds as expected the discussion in the generally non existing regular case used by authors in 14 see also 84 to explain the phi losophy of sft will carry through in an averaged sense the integrals or correlators have a factor of a pullback of na in them we add some more detail and we assume for simplicity that we work with the full subcategory of stable maps without marked points the associated orbit space is an open subset z of z which is the union of suitable elements a 0 z denote by z the lift of z and by the lift of we shall call a class a with even polyfolds and sft 109 fredholm index an odd class this seems somewhat odd but recall that we have divided out by the r action and a class with odd fredholm index an even class suppose the orientations have been worked out for a parent class a with ind a 0 the fredholm index on a we denote by hi a for 0 1 the count of solutions the coarse moduli space consists of isolated points with rational multi plicities hence we obtain maps hi i q we are only interested in the restriction of hi to classes a which are parent classes and which in addition do not have bad orbits at the positive and negative punctures denote these restrictions by h i and the domain by i e h i r using the lift of our transversal perturbation we can take for fixed t 0 1 using the fact that the t projection is submersive the moduli category consisting of all objects s t where a s t a s t j 0 and we define for a h t a a t p na see 52 for the definition this is essentially a sophisticated integral over ma t i e the coarse moduli space above t which uses some of the overhead to define it hence h t r since we have a z 2 grading by even and odd elements in we can write a map on as a sum of an even and an odd map a odd even map vanishes on even odd elements then for fixed a t ht a is a smooth map interpolating between hi a for i 0 1 for this we need that the parametrized moduli spaces are in general position it is important that the latter satisfies a linear differential equation to explain this we note that one can define for a with ind a 1 a family t lt a then we can also define a super commutator which is defined as follows g f a facea g a f a f a g a where a a is associated to the signs are picked in such a way that is graded commutative then we obtain the flow d dt t lt t and it has the important property that ht t h 0 sft in this case without marked points is then a suitable representation of this data where we recall that associated a we have its genus as well as the ingoing and outgoing periodic orbits and a relative 2 nd homology class in q one can extend this procedure to the case when we have marked points in the non marked case lt is obtained from classes with ind a 1 110 joel w fish and helmut hofer finally a remark about the way lt is defined in a simple model assume that m is an oriented compact manifold with smooth boundary with corners and e m an oriented vector bundle with dim em 1 dim m consider the projection p 0 1 m m and take the pull back of the bundle e m we consider in 0 1 m e s t m f s t m tranversal to the zero section so that w f 1 0 is a smooth manifold so that in addition the t projection is submersive and for every t 0 1 the fiber wt of w 0 1 is in general position to the boundary in in 0 1 m then the t fiber wt is a smooth manifold of dimension n and the projection wt in is proper the pull back of the 1 form dt on 0 1 to w defines a point wise non zero one form on w we can take a vectorfield x on w so that x 1 we define ix p w n which is n 1 form on w this form does not depend on the choice of x now we can integrate over every wt to obtain a function lt in the sft case this has to be done in the branched case and to be successful it requires some properties from the perturbation which are also used to make sure that one has an extension result polyfolds and sft 111 appendices and references in this appendix we collect known facts and introduce notation and notions which are used throughout this text 17 structures associated to riemann surfaces the main purpose of this appendix is to recall basic facts about riemann surfaces and most importantly fix notions and notation which will be used throughout this lecture note a 17 1 basic notions we recall some facts feeding into the dm theory and refer the reader to 51 for more detail particularly with respect to the modified version using the exponential gluing profile for the latter there are also important details in 50 disk pairs we are interested in compact disk like riemann surfaces dx with smooth boundary and interior point x which we shall write as dx x we refer to x as a nodal point an un ordered nodal disk pair d has the form dx tdy x y where dx and dy are as just described an ordered nodal disk pair has the form dxtdy x y the ordered pair x y is called an ordered nodal pair and x y is called an un ordered nodal pair in the case x y we shall refer to x as the lower nodal point and y as the upper nodal point given dx x a decoration x of the nodal point x is a an oriented real line x txdx the circle s 1 r z acts naturally on the tangent spaces using their complex structures and therefore it acts also on the possible decorations for x by x x e 2 i x 25 next we consider unordered pairs x y which we call a decorated unordered nodal pair or a decoration of the nodal pair x y we declare x y to be equivalent to x 1 y where s 1 the symbol x y denotes the equivalence class associated to x y x y x 1 y s 1 26 we call x y a natural angle or argument associated to x y we denote by s x y the collection of all x y associated to x y and call it the set of arguments or angles associated to x y denote by s 1 the standard unit circle in c fixing z x 0 y 0 the map arz s x y s 1 x 0 y 0 e 2 i 27 is a bijection and any two such maps say arz and arz have a transition map arz ar 1 z which is a rotation on s 1 hence s x y has a natural smooth structure it also has 112 joel w fish and helmut hofer a natural orientation by requiring that arz is orientation preserving where s 1 is equipped with the orientation as a boundary of the unit disk consider formal expressions r x y where r 0 1 4 the choice of 1 4 has no deeper meaning other than that certain constructions need a bound on the choice of r and in our case 1 4 is always a good bound we say that r x y r x y provided either r r 0 or r r 0 and x y x y in the following we shall call r x y a natural gluing parameter associated to x y the collection b x y of these formal gluing parameters r x y has a natural one dimensional holomorphic manifold structure so that fixing any x 0 y 0 the map r x 0 y 0 r e 2 i onto the standard open disk in r of radius 1 4 is a biholomorphic map when we deal with a finite number of disk pairs we can take their unordered or ordered nodal pair as an index set we shall for example write d for the whole collection of all occurring x y and we shall write d for the collection i e d dx tdy x y x y d 28 sometimes always clear from the context we also view d as defining the disjoint union of all dx where x varies over d x y d x y together with the collection d of nodal pairs d z d dz d 29 this is a specific compact nodal riemann surface with smooth boundary associated to every x y we have the set of natural gluing parameter b x y and we shall write bd for the set of total gluing parameters which are maps a associating to x y an element a x y b x y we can view bd as sections of a bundle over the finite set d namely x y d b x y d a x y x y from this viewpoint a natural gluing parameter is a section gluing disks consider an un ordered nodal disk pair d dxtdy x y consist ing of disk like riemann surfaces dx and dy with smooth boundaries containing the interior points x and y respectively so that dx x and dy y are biholomorphic to d 0 where d c is the closed unit disk these biholomorphic maps are not unique but any two of them differ by a rotation which is biholomorphic denote for 0 d by 0 the standard decoration given by r t 0 d with the standard orientation polyfolds and sft 113 of the real numbers if x is a decoration of x there exists a unique biholomorphic map hx dx x d 0 in the following we need the exponential gluing profile 0 1 0 defined by r e 1 r e definition 17 1 given an unordered disk pair dx t dy x y and a non zero gluing parameter a x y r x y define the set za x y by za x y z z z dx z dy 30 hx z hy z e 2 r here x y is a representative of x y but the definition of the set does not depend on its choice if the gluing parameter vanishes i e if a x y 0 we define z 0 dx tdy x y we note that za zb if and only if a b and in fact za zb 6 if and only if a b za x y is said to be obtained from dx tdy x y by gluing with gluing parameter a x y remark 17 2 we use this special gluing profile in order to have compatibility with the sc freholm theory we obtain the classical deligne mumford theory when we use the gluing profile r 1 2 ln r given a non zero gluing parameter a x y r x y x y put r r x y and define the closed annuli ax r dx and ay r dy of modulus 2 r by ax r z dx x hx z e 2 r ay r z dy y hy z e 2 r the set za x y defined in 30 for non zero gluing parameter has a natural holo morphic manifold structure making it biholomorphic to a closed annulus of modulus 2 r x y so that in addition the maps ax r a x y x za x y a x y y ay r 31 defined by x z z z and y z z z are biholomorphic hence lemma 17 3 za x y has a natural structure as a riemann surface assume that a x y and a x y are two nonzero gluing parameters in b x y with the same modulus we abbreviate r a x y a x y 114 joel w fish and helmut hofer in this case we obtain two copies of the diagram 31 say with a a x y and a a x y ax r ax za ay ay r 32 ax r a x za a y ay r we can compare the following two maps ax r ay r ay a x 1 and a y a x 1 given dx x there is a well define notion of a rotation by s 1 namely take any biholomorphic map h dx x d 0 and define rx z h 1 e 2 i h z this definition does not depend on the choice of h and it follows immediately that the following identity holds hx rx he 2 i x e 2 i hx 33 we obtain the following lemma which can be verified by a straight forward calcula tion lemma 17 4 writing a a x y and a a x e 2 i y where a a 6 0 it holds that ay a x 1 r y a y a x 1 proof by definition za z z hx z hy z e 2 r and with a a x e 2 i y we see that za z z hx z e 2 i hy z e 2 r 34 z z hx z hy r z e 2 r z r z hx z hy z e 2 r from this it follows that if ay ax 1 z z then a y a x 1 z r z and consequently r a y a x 1 z z ay a x 1 z definition 17 5 if a a x y 6 0 with r a x y we denote by m p d a the collection of all z z za such that 12 ln hx z r 2 p 2 r 2 p 2 note that this is only well defined if a x y is sufficiently small given p we call m p d a the middle annulus of width 2 p of za polyfolds and sft 115 for example with a b x y this is well defined as long as 0 p 25 when we are given a finite family of unordered disk pairs d and a gluing parameter a bd we denote by za the disjoint union of all z x y a x y in the case that a x y 0 we have that z x y a x y dx tdy x y and consequently if a 0 we see that za d in the case of ordered disk pairs we use a similar formalism it will be clear from the context in which situation we are holomorphic polar coordinates given dx x let x be a decoration take the asso ciated hx dx x d 0 satisfying thx x 0 we introduce the biholomorphic maps x 0 s 1 dx x s t h 1 x e 2 s it and x 0 dx x s t h 1 x e 2 s it we shall call x positive and negative holomorphic polar coordinates on dx around x associated to the decoration x if dx t dy x y is nodal disk pair and a b x y we obtain through gluing the space za with a a x y fix a representative x y we have the special biholomorphic maps where r a 35 a x 0 r s 1 za s t x s t y s r t a y r 0 s 1 za s t x s r t y s t there are also maps a x and a y obtained by interchanging the roles of x and y in the case of an ordered disk pair the maps in 35 are the relevant ones i e we take positive holomorphic polar coordinates for the lower disk and negative one for the upper disk as part of the constructions we shall consider maps u za rn and sometimes need to evaluate the average over the loop in the middle for this we can pick a nodal point in x y say x and take ax and calculate with r a s 1 u ax r 2 t dt the integral does not depend on the choice of x or y in x y and after the choice of x it does not depend on the decoration x we call the integral the middle loop average we call any of the maps t ax r 2 t or t a y r 2 t a middle loop map if a 0 and u is defined on the disk pair being continuous over the nodal value i e u x u y then we can define the associated middle loop average as u x or u y which are the same 116 joel w fish and helmut hofer a related concept is that of an a loop assume we have a map defined on dx or the punctured dx x pick positive holomorphic polar coordinates centered at x i e r s 1 dx x assume that u dx rn is a continuous map and a b a nonzero gluing parame ter we define an a loop as the map s 1 dx x t a t r 2 t where r a there is a whole s 1 family of a loops however the integral s 1 u a t dt does not depend on the choice of the specific a loop 17 2 riemann surfaces after some preparation we shall describe the category of stable riemann surfaces and introduce auxiliary structures for the dm theory 17 2 1 nodal riemann surfaces we shall consider tuples s j m d consist ing of a compact riemann surface s j without boundary but possibly discon nected where m is a finite unordered subset of s called unordered marked points and d is a finite collection of unordered pairs x y where x y s are dif ferent points we require that d has the property that x y x y 6 implies that x y x y we shall write d for the union of all the x y i e d x y d x y and require that d m we refer to the elements x y as nodal pairs and to x and y as nodal points we can view the tuples as objects of a category for the following discussion we assume m and the elements of d to be unordered a morphism is given by a tuple where s j s j is a biholomorphic map such that m m and d d where d x y x y d we denote the category with objects s j m d and morphisms by r remark 17 6 we shall sometimes consider modifications namely we may allow m to be ordered and in this case referred to as the set of ordered marked points we also sometimes allow some of the nodal pairs to be ordered i e the object are x y rather than x y and we refer to an ordered nodal pair we shall discuss later on in more detail objects in r together with a finite group g acting on it by biholomorphic maps preserving the additional structure polyfolds and sft 117 17 2 2 the category of stable riemann surfaces denote by r the full subcategory of r associated to objects which satisfy an additional condition namely we impose the stability condition 36 that for every connected component c of s its genus g c and the number c c m d satisfies 2 g c c 3 36 from the classical deligne mumford theory see 12 74 and also 42 it follows that r is what we shall call a groupoidal category namely every morphism is an isomorphism between two objects are at most finitely morphisms a consequence of the stability condition and the collection of isomorphism classes r is a set it is also an important fact that r has a natural metrizable topology for which the connected components are compact we shall call r the category of stable riemann surfaces with unordered marked points and nodal pairs 17 2 3 glued riemann surfaces let be an object in r and denote by g a finite group acting by automorphisms of definition 17 7 a pair g where is an object in r and g a finite group acting by automorphisms will be called a riemann surface with a finite group action remark 17 8 note that the biholomorphic automorphism group might be infinite however g utilizes only a finite part of the existing symmetries an obvious ex ample is the riemann sphere where we can take a finite subgroup of the rational transformations assume g is given where is an object in r define b by b x y d b x y which as a product of one dimensional complex manifolds is a complex manifold there is a natural projection b d and a gluing parameter for an object is a section a of i e it associates to x y d a symbol a x y b x y a d b x y a x y the natural action of g on d by g x y g x g y lifts to a natural action of g on the complex manifold of natural gluing parameters g b b by g a b where writing a x y r x y x y we have b g x g y r x y tg x tg y for x y d 118 joel w fish and helmut hofer we fix for every z d a closed disk like neighborhood dz with smooth boundary and z an interior point so that the union of these dz is invariant under g we also require that m dz for all z d this choice gives for every x y d an unordered nodal disk pair d x y dx tdy x y definition 17 9 the collection d of these disk pairs having the properties stated above is called a small disk structure for in case we have an ordered nodal pair x y we obtain an ordered disk pair written as dx tdy x y we shall refer to dx as the lower disk and dy as the upper disk we usually would also assume that the action of g would map an ordered nodal pair to an ordered nodal pair and also preserve the ordering given an object s j m d in r and a small disk structure d it is con venient to note that given d we can recover d hence we introduce the objects s j m d which are compact riemann surfaces with small disk structure as well as s j m d g which is s j m d g equipped with a small disk structure so that the union of the disks is invariant assume that s j m d is a nodal stable riemann surface with unordered marked points and nodal points and g is a finite group acting on as previously described fix a small disk structure d which for every x y gives us an unordered nodal disk pair dxtdy x y hence we consider s j m d g given a gluing parameter a for we obtain the a x y and obtain by disk gluing z x y a za x y which is obtained from dx t dy x y by gluing with a x y if a x y 0 we recover the nodal disk pair remove from s for every nonzero a x y the complement in dx t dy of ax r t ay r where r a x y here ax z dx z x s t s 0 r and similarly for ay we define a new surface sa using for every x y with non zero gluing parameter 31 the holomorphic equivalence relation on ax r t ay r identifying z ax r with z ay r provided z z z x y a if the gluing parameter for some x y vanishes we do not do anything having carried out this for every nodal pair we obtain a nodal riemann surface surface sa with associated almost complex structure ja we denote by da the collection of all x y d with a x y 0 we shall write ma for the set m viewed as a subset of sa finally we set a sa ja ma da definition 17 10 we call a the stable riemann surface obtained from by gluing with a for g g one easily verifies that the construction of sa allows to construct in a natural way a biholomorphic map ga a g a given h g g we have the polyfolds and sft 119 functorial properties hg a ga h g a and 1 a id a 17 3 riemann surface buildings the building blocks are tuples s j d where s j is a not necessarily connected compact riemann surface d is a a set of nodal pairs and are a finite set of so called positive and negative punctures the sets d and are mutually disjoint let us denote such an object by we allow finite groups g acting on such a by biholomorphic maps where we impose the restriction that g preserves the sets and the set of nodal pairs d a small disk structure d for consists of a small disk structure associated to the nodal pairs in d so that the union of the disks is invariant under g the disks are assumed to be mutually disjoint and not to contain the points in denoting by b the set of natural gluing parameters we obtain through gluing a sa ja da where we identify naturally as a subset of sa we shall call a a d descendent of it is convenient to consider the smooth manifold of gluing parameters bd together with the g action as a translation groupoid g n bd we can also consider the groupoid whose objects are the glued a and the morphisms are the a ga g a obviously the two groupoids are isomorphic via a a and g a a ga g a we also note that g defines actions g denote by gn the associated translation groupoids for which we have the equivariant diagram of inclusions a we generalize this now as follows we first consider tuples 0 b 1 bk 1 k 1 where i i si ji di i is as just described and bi i 1 i is a bijection we assume g is a finite group acting acting on each 0 k 1 by biholomorphic maps as previously described moreover g defines actions on the i and we assume that these actions are such that every bi i 1 i is equivariant we fix for every z bi z an ordered disk pair d z bi z dz t dbi z z bi z and assume that the union of these disks is invariant under g of course the disks are mutually disjoint and do not intersect the floor disks an interface gluing parameter for the i 1 i interface i 1 k is a map ai 1 i which assigns to z bi z a gluing parameter ai 1 i z having the additional property that either all its components are zero or all of its components are non zero a total gluing parameter is given as 2 k 1 tuple a 0 a 0 1 a 1 ak 1 k ak denote by 1 i 1 i k the ordered sequence of indices such that ai 1 i 0 we say that we have nontrivial interfaces i 1 1 i 1 i 1 i given and the small disk structure applying the total gluing parameter we obtain a which again is a riemann surface building the collection 120 joel w fish and helmut hofer of all such riemann surface buildings we shall refer to as the set of d descendents of for example if a has the nontrivial interfaces 1 i 1 i k let us introduce i 0 0 and i 1 k 1 then define se i ie ie 1 1 si and de i ie ie 1 1 di i ie 1 ie 1 1 di 1 i as punctures we take ie and ie 1 1 so that we obtain ie se je de ie 1 1 the gluing parameters aie aie ie 1 aie 1 1 allow us to glue this surface and obtain a e together with the bie we obtain the riemann surface building a 0 bi 1 a 1 bi 2 bi a 18 stable hamiltonian structures and periodic orbits we recall the notion of a stable hamiltonian structure and derive useful results which are needed in this text and quite well known 18 1 stable hamiltonian structures one of the important objects is that of a stable hamiltonian structure a detailed study of these structures can be found in 9 18 1 1 basic definition we begin with the definition of a stable hamiltonian struc ture definition 18 1 letq be a closed odd dimensional manifold of dimension dim q 2 n 1 a stable hamiltonian structure on q is given by a pair where is a closed two form of maximal rank on q and a one form such that 1 n 1 is a volume form 2 the vector field r called the reeb vector field defined by ir 1 and ir 0 satisfies lr 0 the latter condition implies by cartan s formula 0 lr dir ird ird since r spans the kernel of this implies ker ker d 37 polyfolds and sft 121 the fact that ir 0 implies again by the cartan formula that lr 0 remark 18 2 the standard example for a stable hamiltonian structure is d where is a contact form on q stable hamiltonian structures are an interesting object to study see 9 it is important to have such structures when studying pseudoholomorphic curves see 14 these structures allow to control certain area based energy functionals which is important in obtaining a priori estimates associated to a stable hamiltonian structure on q we have the distribution ker and the natural splitting of the tangent bundle tq rr we observe that the line bundle rr has a distinguished section r and is in a natural way a symplectic vector bundle with symplectic structure being let us observe that the flow t associated to r maps a vector in x to a vector in t x t t t x 38 18 1 2 symplectic forms associated to q we discuss stable hamiltonian manifolds q in somewhat more detail denote by p r q q the ob vious projection and given a smooth map r r we denote by the map r q r defined by s q s given q and we can consider the two form on r q defined by p d p which we shall write sloppily as d we observe that s q q s d q s ds if s is small enough we see that q s d q as a two form on q is maximally non degenerate and ker s d ker in view of 37 the maximal non degeneracy implies that s d restricted to 0 q t s q r q is non degenerate i e a symplectic form if satisfies this smallness condition and in addition s 0 for all s then is a symplectic form hence we have obtain lemma 18 3 given a smooth manifold q equipped with a stable hamiltonian struc ture q there exists 0 such that for every smooth r with s 0 for all s r the two form is symplectic in view of this lemma we make the following definition definition 18 4 we denote for 0 by the set of all smooth maps r satisfying s 0 for all s r 122 joel w fish and helmut hofer in the case of q equipped with a contact form we obtain the stable hamiltonian structure q d in this case we can take any smooth map r 1 and assuming that s 0 it follows that 1 d s ds d 1 is symplectic a possible example is the map s es 1 which gives d et which is the usual symplectization form we note that in the general case of stable hamiltonian structures the upper bound on is important to get symplectic forms 18 1 3 compatible almost complex structures starting with a stable hamiltonian structure q we take the manifold r q and fix 0 with the properties guaranteed by lemma 18 3 we consider the set of all 2 forms on r q with then this collection is invariant under the r action on r q via addition on the first factor with ker we obtain the symplectic vector bundle q and fix a complex structure for this vector bundle i e a smooth fiber preserving map j with the following two properties 1 j 2 id 2 gj r defined by gj q h k q h j q k is fiber wise a positive definite inner product with r being the reeb vectorfield we define a smooth r invariant almost complex structure j for r q by j a q h kr q k hr q j q 39 where h k r and consider for the fiber wise bilinear form id j we compute with a vector h kr q t s q r q id j h kr q h kr q 40 s d j q s h 2 k 2 0 since s d is non degenerate on we see that in case s 0 the expression is a positive definite quadratic form lemma 18 5 given a smooth manifold with stable hamiltonian structure q and a r invariant almost complex structure j as described in 39 pick an admissible 0 as in definition 18 4 then for every the fiber wise symmetric quadratic form q defined with h kr q t s q r q by q s q h kr q h kr q j s q h kr q polyfolds and sft 123 satisfies q s q 0 if has the property s 0 for all s r it satisfies q s q 0 18 2 periodic orbits we start with the abstract notion of a periodic orbit in a smooth manifold definition 18 6 a periodic orbit in a smooth manifold q is a tuple t k where 1 s 1 q is a smooth embedding and is the equivalence class of where provided t t c for all t s 1 where c s 1 is a suiable constant 2 t is a positive real number and k 1 an integer here t is called the period and k is the covering number the fraction t 0 t k is called the minimal period it is an important fact that a given hamiltonian structure on an odd dimensional manifold q produces automatically a set of periodic orbits we shall explain this next where we give a formulation compatible with the general definition definition 18 7 assume q is equipped with and r is the associated reeb vector field a periodic orbit for v is a tuple t k with k being a nonzero positive integer t a positive number s 1 q a smooth embedding and the set of reparameterisations of i e t t c where c s 1 such that the following property holds d dt t t k r t we call t the period and k the covering number and t k the minimal period remark 18 8 the way to think about a periodic orbit for q is as follows take the reeb vector field r and solve x r x assume we have a periodic orbit x t i e there exists a t 0 such that x 0 x t then there exists an integer k 1 such that x t 6 x 0 for 0 t t k x 0 x t k and t k is called the minimal period we can define the embedding r z q by t x tt k then d dt t t k r t if we take another point on x r and solve the differential equation with this as starting point we obtain a map y which again can be viewed as a t periodic solution y t applying the same procedure we obtain another element in hence our notation keeps track of the period the minimal period and the set s 1 with a preferred class of parameterizations 124 joel w fish and helmut hofer definition 18 9 consider a periodic orbit t k associated to q we say that t k is non degenerate if the symplectic map t t p p p for some fixed p s 1 does not have 1 in its spectrum the definition does not depend on the choice of p if for a hamiltonian structure all periodic orbits are non degenerate we say that is a non degenerate stable hamiltonian structure remark 18 10 it is always possible to perturb a contact form in c by keeping the associated contact structure so that the new form is non degenerate the situation for stable hamiltonian structure is more subtle see 10 9 it seems to be possible to always perturb them to a morse bott situation our discussion of polyfold structures can be generalized to this case but we shall not do it here and concentrate on the non degenerate case for the sc fredholm theory we are interested in the situation where the periodic orbits come from a non degenerate stable hamiltonian structure on q definition 18 11 given a smooth compact manifold equipped with a non degenerate stable hamiltonian structure q we denote by p q the collection of all periodic orbits t k we denote by p q the union p q p q for the sc fredholm theory it will be important to associate to the elements in p q weight sequences however care has to be taken that these choices are compatible with spectral gaps coming from a certain class of self adjoint operators which occur naturally after a choice of almost complex structure compatible with has been made we shall discuss this at the end of the next subsection after introducing the before mentioned class of self adjoint operators called asymptotic operators 18 3 special coordinates and asymptotic operators consider q a smooth manifold with a stable hamiltonian structure with ker we equip the symplectic vector bundle q with a compatible complex structure j j 2 id so that id j equips each fiber with a positive definite inner product we equip q with the riemannian metric gj id j 41 as we already explained before the data j will determine a r invariant almost complex structure j on r q see 39 and this structure will be important in the sc fredholm theory however not every j will work for a pseudoholomorphic curve polyfolds and sft 125 theory in r q it will be important that the underlying q is non degenerate and that weight sequences are picked appropriately one can express this in various ways the choice here is to pick suitable special coordinates and to bring the study of a periodic orbit into the context of a special model of course it will be important to verify that different choices of special coordinates lead to the same conclusion 18 3 1 special coordinates we are interested in the geometry near a given periodic orbit t k the idea is to transfer the general problem to the model case q 0 s 1 r 2 n 2 with periodic orbit 0 t k where 0 t t 0 we equip q 0 with 0 dt and 0 n 1 i 1 dxi dyi which is a degenerate structure we denote by j 0 the standard structure on r 2 n 2 r 2 r 2 where on the r 2 factors 1 0 is mapped to 0 1 we define 0 ker dt and as inner product dt dt r 2 n 2 note that 0 id j 0 r 2 n 2 what will be of interest to us are structures j defined near 0 s 1 which coincide with 0 0 j 0 on 0 s 1 this data j will be obtained as the push forward of a restriction of j on q to a small open neighborhood of s 1 by a special choice of coordinates definition 18 12 let q be a smooth manifold with a stable hamiltonian structure consider a periodic orbit t k a special coordinate transforma tion is a smooth diffeomorphism u s 1 u 0 s 1 which has the following properties 1 there exists a representative such that t 0 t 2 for every t s 1 the tangent map t t t t q t 0 t q 0 induces a linear isomorphism t t 0 0 t which is complex linear and isometric for the distinguished inner products the following is left as an exercise lemma 18 13 given q j and a periodic orbit t k there exist for given representative suitable open neighborhoods u s 1 and u 0 s 1 and a special coordinate transformation u s 1 u 0 s 1 with the property t 0 t 126 joel w fish and helmut hofer 18 3 2 asymptotic operator we start with q and an associated periodic or bit t 0 k 0 consider the map which associates to an element y in c 1 s 1 q the loop d dt y t 0 r y the latter can be viewed as a c 0 section of y tq the section vanishes at x and consequently has a linearization l at every representative of having fixed take a special coordinate such that t 0 t with this choice of and given a loop y near we obtain a loop y near 0 we consider the following which associates to a smooth loop z near 0 the smooth loop z in r 2 n 1 defined by t pr 2 t d dt 1 z t t 0 r 1 z t 42 we note that we can rewrite this as t d dt z t t 0 pr 2 t r 1 z t we differentiate this expression at z 0 in the direction h to obtain l h which is a loop s 1 r r 2 n 2 with the linear map b t r r 2 n 2 r r 2 n 2 being obtained by differentiating y t 0 pr 2 t r 1 y at 0 t we see that l has the form l h d dt h b t h lemma 18 14 the following holds true 1 the map b has the form b t h 1 0 b t where h h 1 r r 2 n 2 2 j 0 b t is symmetric for the standard structure on r 2 n 2 3 the unbounded operator defined in l 2 s 1 r 2 n 2 with domain h 1 s 1 r 2 n 2 by h j 0 ddth b t h is self adjoint and has a compact resolvent proof these are known results and we refer for a discussion to 7 11 84 with the above discussion in mind we make the following definition definition 18 15 given q j and a periodic orbit t 0 k 0 we denote for given special coordinates by l the linear unbounded self adjoint operator l l 2 s 1 r 2 n 2 h 1 s 1 r 2 n 2 l 2 s 1 r 2 n 2 43 h j 0 ddth b t h polyfolds and sft 127 it is important to know the relationship between l and l given two different choices of special coordinates given an ordered pair we have that t 0 t t t s 1 there exists a well define element c c s 1 called phase such that t t c for t s 1 next we study a pair with phase c c we consider the transition map 1 which is defined on an open neighborhood of 0 s 1 in s 1 r 2 n 2 lemma 18 16 the following identity holds for a pair with phase c 1 0 t c 0 t proof we compute 0 t t t c 1 0 t c abbreviate 1 from the properties of and we know that for t z s 1 r 2 n 2 it holds that t c 0 t 0 and moreover d t 0 0 r 2 n 2 0 r 2 n 2 further the induced map r 2 n 2 r 2 n 2 is unitary for using the complex structure coming from j 0 denoting this map by u t we obtain a loop of unitary matrices we note that d t 0 h k h u t k h k r r 2 n 2 unitary here means that the operators commute with j 0 and are isometric given the unitary loop u we shall write u 1 for the point wise inverted loop lemma 18 17 for given we have the identity u t u t c u t 44 proof we shall write 1 1 1 and recall that 1 0 t 0 t c differentiating the first expression along 0 t and taking the r 2 n 2 part we obtain at 0 t u t u t c u t finally we show the following proposition 18 18 for given q j and a choice of periodic orbit t 0 k 0 consider for associated special coordinates the asymptotic operators l and l then the following equality holds l u l u 1 128 joel w fish and helmut hofer proof we have the following two expressions from which l and l are being de rived z d dt z t 0 pr 2 t r 1 z 45 y d dt y t 0 pr 2 t r 1 y let us define 1 we note that 0 t 0 t c where c c we define the map z y by y t c z t we compute d dt y t 0 pr 2 t r 1 y t c d dt y t c t 0 pr 2 t r 1 y t c d dt z t t 0 pr 2 t t r 1 z t d z t d dt z t t 0 t r 1 z t differentiating the relationship y t c z t between the input loop z and the output loop y with respect to z at 0 in the direction of h gives k t c d t 0 h t hence we obtain d dt k t c b t c k t c d t 0 d dt h t b t h t specializing we obtain from this for h h 1 s 1 r 2 n 2 also the relation ship d dt k t c b t c k t c u t d dt h t b t h t this means that d dt b u h u d dt h b h and after multiplying by j 0 we obtain the desired result as a consequence of the previous discussion we can define the j spectral interval around 0 associated to a periodic orbit t k associated to q and j definition 18 19 let q be a closed manifold equipped with a stable hamil tonian structure and j an admissible complex multiplication for ker q the polyfolds and sft 129 j spectral interval associated to a periodic orbit t 0 k 0 is the largest in terval a b r a 0 b such that l a b here l is the spectrum associated to this self adjoint operator we also define j l which of course does not depend on and call it the j spectrum of remark 18 20 since for the associated operators are unitarily conjugated the j interval does not depend on the choice of special coordinate in the case that is non degenerate the spectral interval will be nonempty containing 0 in the interior as just mentioned the non degeneracy assumption implies that 0 6 j since the operator l has a compact resolvent we have a spectral gap around 0 we call a positive number associated to t k admissible provided j note that the admissibility of depends on the original choice of j which most of the time is fixed from the beginning if we want to stress the dependence on j we call admissible for j there are several notions and results associated to periodic orbits which are frequently used in constructions definition 18 21 given a non degenerate stable hamiltonian structure on the closed manifold q and a compatible j we call a map o p 0 a weight selector associated to j provided for every t k p the number j associated to j is admissible and bounded strictly by 2 in addition we require that 0 2 a weight sequence i for j is a sequence of weight functions m so that for every periodic orbit or we have 0 0 1 18 4 conley zehnder and maslov index in the fredholm index theory for the cr operator the conley zehnder index plays an important role we follow 11 which is based on 20 21 53 79 we view r 2 as a symplectic vector space with coordinates x y and symplectic form dx dy then r 2 n is identified with the direct sum r 2 r 2 coordinates x 1 y 1 xn yn and symplectic form n i 1 dxi dyi 18 4 1 conley zehnder index denoting by sp n the group of linear symplectic maps r 2 n r 2 n we consider the space of continuous arcs 0 1 sp n starting at the identity id 2 n at t 0 and ending at 1 which is a symplectic map not 130 joel w fish and helmut hofer having 1 in the spectrum we denote by n the maps 0 1 sp n starting and ending at id 2 n the map g n n n t t t is well defined we also have the inversion map n n 1 1 t t 1 finally there is the obvious map n m n m a classical map nm g n z is the maslov index which is characterized by the following theorem theorem 18 22 the maps nm for n 1 are characterized by the following requirements 1 two loops 1 2 g n are homotopic in g n if and only if nm 1 nm 2 2 the map induced on 1 sp n id by n m is a group isomorphism to z i e in this particular case equivalently nm 1 2 n m 1 n m 1 here 1 2 t 1 t 2 t 3 it holds mn t e 2 itid 2 id 2 n 2 1 having characterized the maslov index we state the main result about the conley zehnder index the conley zehnder index refers to a family of maps ncz n z n 1 2 theorem 18 23 there exists a unique family ncz n z for n 1 2 characterized by the following properties 1 homotopic maps in g n have the same index ncz 2 for g n and n the identity ncz n cz 2 n m 3 ncz 1 ncz 0 4 1 cz 1 where t e itidr 2
