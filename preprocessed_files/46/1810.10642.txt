e mail xufeng math ucr edu abstract we prove that the mutual information for vacuum state as defined by araki is finite for quantum field theory of free fermions on a minkowski spacetime of any dimension in the case of two dimensional chiral conformal field theory cft we use our previous results for the free fermions to show that for a large class of chiral cft the mutual information is finite we also provide a direct relation between relative entropy and the index of a representation of conformal net supported in part by nsf grant dms 1764157 1 http arxiv org abs 1810 10642 v 1 1 introduction in the last few years there has been an enormous amount of work by physicists con cerning entanglement entropies in qft motivated by the connections with condensed matter physics black holes etc see the references in 15 for a partial list of refer ences however some very basic mathematical questions remain open often the mutual information is argued to be finite based on heuristic physical arguments and one can derive the singularities of the entropies from the mutual information by taking singular limits but it is not even clear that such mutual information which is well defined as a special case of araki s relative entropy is indeed finite all the heuristic computations such those done in 8 and 7 take this for granted and these papers contain a number of amazing results about the nature of such mutual information it is clear that there should be a rich mathematical theory behind these physical con siderations see 14 17 16 18 19 22 and 27 for a partial list of recent mathematical work in 19 we showed that mutual information for massless free fermions is finite and in 19 we calculate its value for all cases in fact this is the only example where all mutual information is known see 10 for recent computations in the case of massless bosons with two intervals the method in 3 of 19 uses the explicit resolvent formula for free fermions which unfortunately is not known in other cases such as free massive fermions one of the goals on this paper is to improve on some of the estimates in 3 of 19 so that we can obtain finiteness of mutual information for all free fermion theories cf corollary 3 7 without having the explicit resolvent formula available the main results which lead to corollary 3 7 are theorem 3 4 and proposition 3 6 we then consider more such finiteness results for chiral cft in two dimensions by embedding into free fermions and using monotonicity of relative entropy first we show that every lattice contains a finite index sublattice which can be embedded into free fermions in corollary 4 3 as a consequence we show that mutual information is finite for all conformal net coming from lattices in corollary 4 4 these immediately show that all conformal nets which can be embedded as a subnet of conformal nets associated with a lattice and with a simply connected lie group g at level k or so called wess zumino witten models their cosets orbifolds simple current extensions and combinations of such constructions the mutual information is always finite our last result theorem 4 5 gives a direct relation between relative entropy and the index of a representation of conformal net in a similar spirit to a result in 4 of 19 the rest of this paper is structured as follows after a preliminary section on von neumann entropy araki s relative entropy we consider the mutual information in an algebraic quantum field theory with split property and use free fermion theory as an example then we consider a general problem motivated by computations of mutual information in 3 where we prove a few keys results such as thereom 3 4 proposition 3 6 the finiteness of mutual information in free qft is obtained as a consequence in corollary 3 7 in 4 we first show that a conformal net al associated with a lattice has a finite index subnet which can be embedded into free fermions it follows by monotonicity of relative entropy that mutual information for al is finite from this 2 we derive the finiteness of mutual information for a large class of chiral cfts in the last subsection we prove theorem 4 5 2 preliminaries 2 1 entropy and relative entropy von neumann entropy is the quantity associated with a density matrix on a hilbert space h by s tr log von neumann entropy can be viewed as a measure of the lack of information about a system to which one has ascribed the state this interpretation is in accord for instance with the facts that s 0 and that a pure state has vanishing von neumann entropy a related notion is that of the relative entropy it is defined for two density matrices by s tr log log 1 like s s is non negative and can be infinite a generalization of the relative entropy in the context of von neumann algebras of arbitrary type was found by araki 1 and is formulated using modular theory given two faithful normal states on a von neumann algebra a in standard form we choose the vector representatives in the natural cone p called the anti linear operator s a a a a is closable and one considers again the polar decomposition of its closure s j 1 2 here j is the modular conjugation of a associated with p and s s is the relative modular operator w r t of course if then is the usual modular operator a related object is the connes cocycle radon nikodym derivative defined as d d t it it a where is an arbitrary auxiliary faithful normal state on a definition 2 1 the relative entropy w r t and is defined by s log lim t 0 d d t 1 it 2 s is extended to positive linear functionals that are not necessarily normalized by the formula s s log where 0 and are normalized if is not normal then one sets s for a type i algebra a b h states correspond to density matrices the square root of the relative modular operator 1 2 corresponds to 1 2 1 2 in the standard representation of a on h h namely h h is identified with the hiilbert schmidt operators hs h with the left right multiplication of a a in this 3 representation corresponds to the vector state 1 2 h h and the abstract definition of the relative entropy in 2 becomes log trh 1 2 log 1 1 log 12 trh log log 3 as another example let us consider a bi partite system with hilbert spaceha hb and observable algebra a b ha b hb a normal state ab on a corresponds to a density matrix ab one calls a trhb ab the reduced density matrix which defines a state a on b ha and similarly for system b the mutual information is given in our example system by s ab a b s a s b s ab 4 a list of properties of relative entropies that will be used later can be found in 21 cf th 5 3 th 5 15 and cor 5 12 21 theorem 2 2 1 let m be a von neumann algebra and m 1 a von neumann sub algebra of m assume that there exists a faithful normal conditional expectation e of monto m 1 if and are states of m 1 and m respectively then s e s m 1 s e 2 let bemi an increasing net of von neumann subalgebras ofm with the property imi m then s 1 mi 2 mi converges to s 1 2 where 1 2 are two normal states on m 3 let and 1 be two normal states on a von neumann algebra m if 1 then s 1 ln 1 4 let and be two normal states on a von neumann algebra m and denote by 1 and 1 the restrictions of and to a von neumann subalgebra m 1 m respectively then s 1 1 s for type iii factors the von neumann entropy is always infinite but we shall see that in many cases mutual information is finite let us describe the setting where the relative entropy we are interested in comput ing we consider the formulation of algebraic quantum field theory on a d d 1 dimensional minkowski spacetime cf 12 let do be an open subset of space time such that the closure of do is compact let a do be the algebra of observable as sociated with do and the vector state given by the vacuum vector for simplicity we will assume that do is the double cone generated by an open set o on the time zero slice rd we shall assume that o has smooth boundary and the closure of o in rd is compact slightly abusing our notation we denote a do simply by a o o 1 and o 2 are disjoint if o 1 o 2 denote by po the set which consists of finite union of disjoint os let o 1 o 2 po with o 1 o 2 let 1 2 be the restriction of to a o 1 a o 2 respectively we shall assume that our theory is split cf 4 for bosonic case and 26 for fermionic case which means that 1 2 which is defined on elements of the form xy x a o 1 y a o 2 by 1 2 xy 1 x 2 y extends to a normal faithful 4 state of the von neumann algebra generated by a o 1 and a o 2 the basic quantity we are interested in is the relative entropy also called mutual information s 1 2 as an example let us consider chiral free fermion cft as discussed in details in 3 of 19 we will describe the formula for mutual information which is proved in th 3 18 of 19 and refer reader to 3 of 19 for more details leth denote the hilbert space l 2 s 1 cr of square summable cr valued functions on the circle fix ii pi i 1 2 and i 1 i 2 disjoint that is i 1 i 2 and i i 1 i 2 denote by ar the graded conformal net associated with r chiral free fermions we will write the normal faithful state 1 2 2 with graded tensor product in 3 of 19 simply as 1 2 and the mutual information we are interested is now sar 1 2 the vacuum state on ar i is a quasi free state as studied by araki in 2 to describe this state it is convenient to use cayley transform v x x i x i which carries the one point compactification of the real line onto the circle and the upper half plane onto the unit disk it induces a unitary map uf x 1 2 x i 1 f v x of l 2 s 1 cr onto l 2 r cr the operator u carries the hardy space on the circle onto the hardy space on the real line we will use the cayley transform to identify intervals on the circle with one point removed to intervals on the real line under the unitary transformation above the hardy projection on l 2 s 1 cr is transformed to the hardy projection on l 2 r cr given by pf x 1 2 f x i 2 1 x y f y dy where the singular integral is proportional to the hilbert transform we write the kernel of the above integral transformation as c c x y 1 2 x y i 2 1 x y 5 the quasi free state is determined by a f a g g pf slightly abusing our notations we will identify p with its kernel c and simply write a f a g g cf c will be called covariance operator definition 2 3 let pi be projections from l 2 i cr onto l 2 ii c r and ci picpi i 1 2 5 let c p 1 c lnc 1 c ln 1 c p 1 c 1 lnc 1 p 1 c 1 ln p 1 c 1 p 2 c lnc 1 c ln 1 c p 2 c 2 lnc 2 p 2 c 2 ln p 2 c 2 and cp be the same as in the definition of c with c replaced by cp pcp if p is a projection commuting with p 1 as a consequence of theorem 3 18 of 19 we have proposition 2 4 s 1 2 lim p 1 tr cp tr c where p 1 strongly 3 estimation of relative entropy proposition 2 4 suggests that it is useful to study the following general problem let h be a hilbert space of countable dimension and p be a projection on h let a be a positive bounded operator on h and b pap 1 p a 1 p it is useful to note that if u 2 p 1 then u 2 1 and b 1 2 a uau in particular b 1 2 a let a pa lnap 1 p a lna 1 p b lnb then the problem is to compute estimate tr a proposition 3 1 1 a 0 t p 1 t a p 1 p 1 t a 1 p 1 t b dt 2 a a 0 proof ad 1 we note that t p 1 t a p 1 p 1 t a 1 p 1 t b 3 and t p 1 t a p 1 p 1 t a 1 p 1 t b p b t b a t a p 1 p b t b a t a 1 p so its norm is bounded by constant multiplied by t 2 when t goes to infinity hence the improper integral is absolutely convergent in operator norm and 1 follows by functional calculus ad 2 by 1 we have a 0 t p 1 t a p 1 p 1 t a 1 p 1 t b dt t p 1 t a p 1 p 1 t a 1 p 1 t b dt 6 so a a 0 t p 1 t a p 1 p 1 t a 1 p 1 t b dt p 1 t a p 1 p 1 t a 1 p 1 t b dt since 1 x is operator convex cf 6 p 1 t a p 1 p 1 t a 1 p 1 t b 0 and 2 is proved as a consequence of 2 of the above proposition we have the following improve ment of theorem 3 12 of 19 proposition 3 2 let p be a finite rank projection commuting with p and a b as above assume that a b is trace class then tr a tr ap proof when a 0 the proposition is theorem 3 12 of 19 now replace a by a and use 2 of proposition 3 1 we have tr a tr a on the other hand since a converges to a strongly it follows that lim 0 tr a tr a and so we have lim 0 tr a tr a and the proposition follows by theorem 3 12 of 19 as an application of proposition 3 2 we specialize a and h as follows we take h l 2 o c o o 1 o 2 po p is the projection onto l 2 o 1 c and a is given by a kernel k x y k x y which is singular when x y but smooth when x 6 y it is instructive to review how s 1 2 tr c is proved choose a sequence of finite rank projections pn which converges strongly to 1 and commute with p then by the property of relative entropy s 1 2 limn tr cpn since cpn 0 converges to c strongly we have s 1 2 tr c the reversed inequality would follow from theorem 3 12 of 19 if we can drop the assumption that a is strictly positive in 19 we use regularized kernel and explicit form of resolvent in the chiral free fermion case cf 1 of lemma 3 15 in 19 to prove the reversed inequality now with proposition 3 2 we will always have s 1 2 tr c even without knowing the explicit form of the resolvent of c in particular this identity is also true for free massive fermions where the corresponding covariance operator c is given by formula 187 in 8 to motivate the next result note that our goal is to estimate a lna b lnb when a b is trace class the derivative of x ln x is singular at x 0 this explains that when a b has 0 in their spectrum one needs additional conditions note that the derivative of x 2 lnx is bounded when x is close to zero and when a b are positive we 7 can consider a ln a b ln b with condition that a b being trace class it is more convenient in applications to replace last condition by a b 1 2 being trace class and that is the condition we impose in theorem 3 4 lemma 3 3 1 t b a a 1 2 t 1 2 t 0 proof for any unit vector h we have 1 t b a 2 a 1 t b 2 a note that t b 2 t 2 2 tb b 2 t 2 ta and so a 1 t b 2 a a 1 t 2 ta a and a 1 t b 2 a 1 t a 1 t a a a 1 t and the lemma follows theorem 3 4 suppose that a b 12 is trace class then a is also trace class proof by 1 of proposition 3 1 a 1 0 t p 1 t a p 1 p 1 t a 1 p 1 t b dt 1 t p 1 t a p 1 p 1 t a 1 p 1 t b dt note that 1 t p 1 t a p 1 p 1 t a 1 p 1 t b dt b ln b 1 pa ln a 1 p 1 p a ln a 1 1 p by lemma 3 11 of 19 ln a 1 ln b 1 is trace class it follows that a ln a 1 b ln b 1 a ln a 1 ln b 1 a b ln b 1 is trace class and so is b ln b 1 pa ln a 1 p 1 p a ln a 1 1 p hence it is sufficient to show that 1 0 t p 1 t a p 1 p 1 t a 1 p 1 t b dt is trace class let 0 1 be a small number and denote by d 1 t p 1 t a p 1 p 1 t a 1 p 1 t b dt 8 we note that d 0 is an increasing sequence of positive trace class operators which converge in norm to 1 0 t p 1 t a p 1 p 1 t a 1 p 1 t b dt it is sufficient to show that tr d is bounded by a constant independent of by assumption b a is trace class we can find an onb of i of h which are the eigenvectors of b a with eigenvalues i we have tr d 1 tr t 1 t a 1 t b dt 1 tr t 1 t b 1 t a b a i i 1 t t a i 1 t b i where the interchange of sum and integral in the third equality follows since the integrand is a continuous function of t in tracial norm first assume that i 0 then from t b i a t i i we have 1 t b i 1 t i i 1 t b a i hence t t a i 1 t i i 1 t b a i 1 t i t t a i 1 t b a 1 1 t i a 12 1 t 1 2 1 where in the last step we have used lemma 3 3 so 1 t t a i 1 t b i dt 1 1 t i a 12 1 t 1 2 1 dt a 12 1 1 2 i ln 1 i ln i when i 0 exchanging the roles of a b as above we have 1 t a i 1 t i i 1 t a b i we have 1 t a b i t t b i 1 t a a i i t t b i 1 t a a i t t b i t t a i 1 t b b a i and it follows that 1 t a b i t t b i 2 1 t b a 2 a 12 1 t 1 2 9 it follows that 1 t t a i 1 t b i dt 1 1 t i 3 a 12 1 t 1 2 dt a 12 1 1 2 i 3 ln 1 i ln i putting these two cases together we have tr d i i a 1 2 i 1 2 3 ln 1 i ln i by assumption i i 1 2 it follows that tr d is bounded by a number inde pendent of and the proof is complete to apply theorem 3 4 to the computation of relative entropy in free qft we specialize a and h as follows we take h l 2 o c o o 1 o 2 po p is the projection onto l 2 o 1 c and a is given by a kernel k x y k x y which is singular when x y but smooth when x 6 y lemma 3 5 1 suppose f 1 pf 1 p 1 p fp where p is a projection and f 12 is trace class then f 1 1 2 is also trace class and pfp 1 2 is also trace class proof let u 2 p 1 then f 1 12 f ufu for a compact operator t we shall denote by n t its n th largest singular value among all nonzero eigenvalues by fan s theorem cf 1 of 25 we have n m 1 f ufu n 1 f m 1 ufu n 1 f m 1 f n m 0 choose n m 0 we have 2 n 1 f ufu 2 n 1 f and choose n m 1 with n 1 we have 2 n 1 f ufu n 1 f n f it follows that 2 n 1 f ufu 1 2 21 2 n 1 f 1 2 2 n f ufu 1 2 n 1 f 1 2 n f 1 2 and so tr f 1 1 2 n n f 1 1 2 2 1 tr f 1 2 the same argu ment with ufu replaced by ufu shows that f ufu 1 2 is trace class note that pfp 1 2 f ufu the second statement in the lemma also follows proposition 3 6 suppose h l 2 o c o o 1 o 2 po p is the projection onto l 2 o 1 c and a is given by a kernel k x y k x y which is singular when x y but smooth when x 6 y then a b 1 2 is trace class proof by assumption a b is given by a kernel k x y k x y which is a smooth function for x o 1 y o 2 choose a large cube cu of length l centered at origin whose interior contains the closure of the union of o 1 o 2 o 1 o 2 o 2 o 1 and let g x 1 xd be a smooth function on cu such that g x y k x y whenever x o 1 y o 2 g x g x and g is periodic in each of its variables with period l the operator t on l 2 cu c given by kernel g x y can be diagonalized by fourier 10 transformation and its eigenvalues as functions of n 1 nd where ni are integers go to zero faster than the inverse of any polynomial in n 1 nd it follows that t 1 2 is trace class a b is pf 1 p 1 p fp where f is the restriction of t to subspace l 2 o 1 o 2 c by lemma 3 5 the proposition is proved since the computation of relative entropy in quantum field theory of free fermions reduces to finite linear combinations of traces of a where a is as in proposition 3 6 combined with theorem 3 4 we have proved the following corollary 3 7 the mutual information in quantum field theory of free fermions on minkowski spacetime of any dimension is finite remark 3 8 for free boson case there is a formula cf equation 63 of 8 for mutual information but the corresponding operator c there is unbounded and does not seem to have a good kernel representations in the case of chiral massless free bosons there has been recent computation of mutual information in the case of two intervals with diagolization of a non symmetric operator cf 3 of 10 we note that in the later case the mutual information is finite since it is embedded into free fermions it is an interesting question to see if one can have a similar treatment of free bosons in general cases as in this section 4 chiral cft we shall refer the reader to 2 of 19 for the definition of conformal net and its properties a positive lattice l of rank n is the z span of a basis 1 n in a vector space with a positive definite inner product such that i j z 1 i j n l is called even if i i 2 z 1 i n to each even positive lattice l one can associate a rational conformal net al cf 11 the free fermion net ar can be considered as conformal net associated with zr with its usual euclidean inner product ar is not local but graded local since zr is not even lemma 4 1 let l be a positive lattice with a basis 1 n and for k a positive integer let kl be the z span of a basis k 1 k n then akl al has index nk proof by 11 the vacuum representation of al decomposes into finitely many irre ducible representations of akl which are in one to one correspondence with abelian group of l kl and all such representations have index 1 note l kl is isomorphic to direct product of n copies of z kz the lemma follows proposition 4 2 let l positive lattice l of rank n with a basis 1 n then 1 there exists a z linear injective map l qr for some positive integer r such that preserves inner product 2 there exists a positive integer k such that the image of kl under lies in zr 11 proof ad 1 it is equivalent to show that for some positive integer r there exist vectors ai a 1 i ari qr such that 1 k r akiakj i j 1 i j n we prove this by induction on n when n 1 one can take a 1 1 1 with r 1 1 assume that the proposition is true for n 1 i e for some positive integer r there exist vectors ai a 1 i ari qr such that 1 k r akiakj i j 1 i j n 1 first we choose a vector a n in the linear span of a 1 an 1 such that a n ai n i 1 i n 1 suppose that a n 1 i n 1 xiai then we have a system of linear equations 1 j n 1 xj j i n i 1 i n 1 since j i are integers it follows that xi q moreover we note that n 1 i n 1 xi i is exactly the projection of n onto the linear space spanned by i 1 i n 1 and it follows that n n 1 k r a kna kn q since n n n n we have n n 1 k r a kna kn p q with both p q positive integers let s r pq and an be a vector in q s whose first r entries are that of a n and the last pq entries are all 1 q and we embed ai into q s by simply adding last pq zeros to the components of ai 1 i n 1 and we have proved the proposition for n by induction the proof is complete ad 2 the image of each i has components in q we just have to choose an integer k such that k multiply each of these components are in z by proposition 4 2 we immediately have corollary 4 3 let l be an even positive lattice and al the associated conformal net then there exist positive integers k r such that akl is a subnet of free r fermion net ar by corollary 4 3 and lemma 4 1 we have proved the following corollary 4 4 let l be an even positive lattice and al the associated conformal net the mutual information for al is finite 12 if g is a simply connected simply laced compact lie group it is known cf 24 that ag 1 is conformal net associated with a lattice when g is not simply laced g is of type b c f 4 g 2 note that so 2 n 1 so 2 n 2 g 2 f 4 e 6 and sp n so 4 n so g 1 can always be embedded into h for some simply laced h hence the mutual information for ag 1 is finite by corollary 4 4 since agk is a subnet of k tensor product of ag 1 it follows that the mutual information for agk is finite by corollary 4 4 it is also clear that the same is true for all conformal nets that can be obtained from cosets orbifolds simple current extensions or combinations of these constructions starting with agk or al and of course any subnets of such conformal nets 4 1 a relation between relative entropy and index fix an interval i 1 a b on a circle suppose is an irreducible representation of a conformal net a localized on i 1 with finite index given by 1 let jn i 1 n 1 be an increasing sequence of intervals such that n jn i 1 j n i 1 a let en be the conditional expectation from a i 1 a jn to a i 1 a jn clearly en 1 is an extension of en we note that by pimsner popa inequality we have en a a positive a a i 1 a jn denote by n en theorem 4 5 lim n s n ln 1 where 1 is the index of representation proof by section 3 6 2 of 19 we note that there is typo in the formula in th 3 24 of 19 there should be a natural log on the righthand side it is sufficient to prove the following as in proposition 3 25 of 19 given any 0 we need to find e a i 1 a jn such that e 1 e 1 e e 1 n ee let e 1 a i 1 be the jones projection for a i 1 a i 1 and v a i 1 be the isometry such that v e 1 v 1 since is irreducible a i 1 a i 1 b h and since na jn a i 1 we can find a sequence of elements en a i 1 a jn n 2 which converges in strong star topology to e 1 now choose xn 1 v e 1 env then xn 1 in strong star topology and so xn x nxn converges to 1 on the other hand by definition en x nxn v e nenv 13 converges to v e 1 v 1 strongly hence given any 0 we can choose n sufficiently large such that if we set e xn then e a i 1 a jn and e 1 e 1 e e 1 n ee one way of interpreting theorem 4 5 is the following let i i 1 j n and denote by i n i the restriction of n to a i respectively when i i 1 j n is disjoint from i 1 by definition n and s i n i 0 then as i increases s i n i will increase when i i 1 j n increases so that njn i 1 theorem 4 5 states that the limiting value is ln 1 this picture has some similarity but not the same to the result in 13 5 outlook there are a number of questions which come naturally from our work does split property imply finiteness of mutual information or less strongly does nuclearity cf 3 20 imply finiteness of mutual information having established finiteness of mutual information in corollary 3 7 the next step will be to understand the singularity structure when the distance between regions goes to zero as in 4 2 of 19 and determine the regularized entropy these may be related to the heuristic computations in 3 of 8 and may provide rigorous definition of c function cf 9 starting with cut off independent relative entropy as in 4 2 of 19 for cft finally it will also be interesting to determine the asymptotics of the mutual information when the distance between regions goes to infinity and compare with the heuristic computations in 7 we plan to address some of these questions in the future acknowledgements part of this work was done when i participated in pitp 2018 at institute for
