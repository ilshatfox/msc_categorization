use morse theory on a certain class 1 skeleta that includes all 1 skeleta of simple polytopes in this paper we extend some of the notions and constructions from 5 to a larger class of 1 skeleta that includes all 1 skeleta of projected simple polytopes as an applica tion of these ideas we prove a lifting result for 1 skeleta which yields a characterization of 1 skeleta of projected simple polytopes 1 introduction a 1 skeleton in rn is a triple where is a d valent graph is a connection that matches edges at adjacent vertices and is an axial func tion that assigns to the edges issuing from each vertex of pairwise linearly independent vectors in rn satisfying certain coplanarity conditions deter mined by the study of 1 skeleta was motivated by work of chang and skjelbred 1 and subsequent work of goresky kottwitz and macpher son 3 where it was observed that the equivariant cohomology of a certain type of topological space equpped with a torus action now known as a n equivariantly formal gkm space could be computed from the linear graph associated to its 0 and 1 dimensional torus orbits an important example of a smooth gkm space i e a gkm manifold is a smooth projective toric variety taken either with its full torus action or with a suitable subtorus action here the 1 skeleton is that of the associated simple polytope or for subtorus actions a linear projection of it in a series of papers 4 6 guillemin and zara formulated the notion of a 1 skeleton as described above and showed that many topological tech niques and theorems regarding gkm manifolds have combinatorial ana logues on 1 skeleta in particular guillemin and zara described combi natorial analogues for symplectic blow up and symplectic reduction and developed a combinatorial analogue of morse theory for 1 skeleta in 5 guillemin and zara described a class of 3 independent 1 skeleta they called noncyclic on whose members their reduction operation and their morse theory apply specifically a d valent k independent k 3 noncyclic 1 skeleton has a morse function and has planar slices that are convex poly gons the reduced spaces or cross sections are the level sets of the morse 1 http arxiv org abs 1203 3836 v 2 2 chris mcdaniel function and are themselves d 1 valent k 1 independent 1 skeleta an important result of 5 proves that all cross sections of a given noncyclic 1 skeleton are related by a finite sequence of blow ups and blow downs while the noncyclic class contains all 1 skeleta of simple polytopes the 3 independence condition excludes many 1 skeleta of projected sim ple polytopes in section 3 we extend the noncyclic class to a larger class of 1 skeleta called reducible by dropping the 3 independence condition and replacing planar slices with subskeleta that we call 2 faces the reducible class then contains all 1 skeleta of simple polytopes as well as all 1 skeleta of projected simple polytopes the reduction operation on the reducible class is slightly complicated without 3 independence the cross sections of a reducible 1 skeleton degenerate but they do so in a manageable way a compatibility system for the triple is a system of positive constants related to the compatibility of and a compatibility system on a 1 skeleton is uniquely determined by the pairwise independence condition on hence is sometimes omitted from the notation in section 3 we define a generalized 1 skeleton as a quadruple where and are as above and is almost an axial function as defined above except that we drop the pairwise linearly independent condition in particular a 1 skeleton is a generalized 1 skeleton we show that the reduction operation of 5 applies almost verbatim to reducible 1 skeleta except that the cross sections of a reducible 1 skeleton are generalized 1 skeleta a reducible d valent d independent 1 skeleton e g the 1 skeleton of a simple d polytope has restrictions on its cross sections that are inherited through projection in particular the cross section of a general reducible 1 skeleton comes with two natural connections up and down and two natural compatibility systems up and down it is straight forward to show that the up datum agrees with the down datum on the cross sections of a d valent d independent 1 skeleton in general the up and down connections on each cross section of a reducible 1 skeleton agree if and only if its 2 faces have trivial normal holonomy and similarly the up and down compatibility sys tems on each cross section agree if and only if the 2 faces are level what is perhaps surprising is that these two properties of 2 faces are sufficient to detect projections of d independent reducible 1 skeleta we say a d valent 1 skeleton has a total lift if it is the projection of a d valent d independent 1 skeleton in section 4 we prove the main result in this paper which char acterizes reducible 1 skeleta admitting a total lift theorem 1 let be a d valent reducible 1 skeleton in rn then has a total lift if and only if every 2 face of is level and has trivial normal holonomy lifting 3 in section 2 we make the important observation that a reducible d valent d independent 1 skeleton in rd corresponds to a complete simplicial fan in r d moreover under this correspondence an embedding for the 1 skeleton corresponds to a strictly convex conewise linear function on the fan thus we have the following corollary to theorem 1 characterizing 1 skeleta of projected simple polytopes corollary 1 a d valent 1 skeleton is the 1 skeleton of a pro jected simple polytope if and only if is reducible all its 2 faces are level with trivial normal holonomy and it admits an embedding f v r n the proof of theorem 1 follows from four lemmata in lemma 1 we strengthen a result of guillemin and zara 5 theorem 2 3 2 that describes the change in cross sections in passing over a critical value as a blow up blow down operation using a cutting technique described in 5 lemma 2 shows that any reducible d valent 1 skeleton satisfying can be realized as the cross section of a reducible d 1 valent 1 skeleton satisfying lemma 3 shows that total lift ability is preserved by a blow up blow down operation finally using lemma 3 lemma 4 shows that every cross section of a reducible 1 skeleton satisfying necessarily has a total lift this paper is divided into five sections in section 2 we introduce some preliminary notions closely following 5 we also discuss the relation ship between complete simplicial fans and 1 skeleta in section 3 we in troduce the notion of a generalized 1 skeleton and extend the necessary components of the machinery developed in 5 we also prove lemma 1 and lemma 2 in section 4 we prove lemma 3 and lemma 4 we then prove theorem 1 and corollary 1 in section 5 we give some concluding remarks this paper represents part of a thesis written at university of massachusetts amherst under the supervision of professor tom braden to whom i am greatly indebted for his endless encouragement patience and advice and without whom i could not have completed this 2 1 skeleta 2 1 preliminaries all graphs in this paper are assumed to be simple i e no multiple edges and no single edge loops let denote a connected reg ular graph with vertex set v and oriented edge set e i e elements of e are ordered pairs of vertices an oriented edge e e has an initial vertex denoted i e and a terminal vertex denoted t e we write e i e t e or if i e and t e are given explicitly as vertices p and q resp then e pq we write e to denote the oppositely oriented edge of e i e if e pq then 4 chris mcdaniel e e e e e figure 1 axial function on a graph e qp the oriented edges at vertex p are those edges with initial vertex p denoted e p the valency of is the cardinality of e p i e if e p d we say is d valent the first piece of structure we impose on is a perfect matching of the sets ei e and et e for all e e definition 1 a connection e e e on is a collection of bijective maps e e i e et e indexed by the oriented edges such that e e e and e e 1 we call the pair a d valent graph connection pair next we assign vector valued weights to the oriented edges of in a way that coincides with a given connection on see fig 1 definition 2 a function e rn is called an axial function for the graph connection pair if it satisfies the following axioms a 1 for every p v the set e e e p is pairwise linearly independent a 2 for each e e we have e e a 3 for every e e and each e ei e e there exist positive constants e e such that e e e e e r e the graph connection axial function triple is called a d valent 1 skeleton in rn denoted rn or simply the numbers e e form a compatibility system for the 1 skeleton note however that is com pletely determined by and by the independence condition in a 1 it is for this reason that is omitted from the notation here in our subsequent generalizations when condition a 1 is dropped it will be important to keep track of definition 3 given a graph we say that a function e rn is 1 k independent if for every vertex p v and for any k subset e 1 ek of oriented edges at p the set e 1 ek is linearly indepen dent 2 effective if the set of vectors ep e e ep r n spans rn for each p v we will say that the 1 skeleton rn is k independent resp effective if is k independent resp effective lifting 5 note that every 1 skeleton is 2 independent by definition furthermore note that if is k independent then it is also j independent for all j k we shall see that independence conditions on a 1 skeleton severely restrict its combinatorics for example the graph of a 1 skeleton may in general admit another connection distinct from for which is compatible on the other hand if is 3 independent then is the unique connection on compatible with note that a 1 skeleton is not an embedded graph a priori the axioms do not specify position vectors for the vertices of on the other hand some embedded graphs are 1 skeleta and conversely some 1 skeleta can be realized as embedded graphs the following definition makes this notion precise definition 4 an embedding of a 1 skeleton rn is a function f v r n with the property that for each oriented edge pq e there is a positive constant cpq r such that f q f p cpq pq if a 1 skeleton rn has an embedding f v r n then can be represented as an embedded graph in the sense that v is identified with the subset f p p v r n and the oriented edges pq e are iden tified with the oriented straight line segments joining f p to f q in this case the axial function takes values pq along these directed line segments 1 t f p t f q although most of the 1 skeleta shown in this paper are embedded a general 1 skeleton need not admit an embedding at all see fig 2 or fig 5 2 1 1 example 1 skeleta from fans we assume a basic familiarity with fans here the reader is referred to 2 or 7 for the necessary prerequisites fix a complete simplicial fan r d and denote by k the set of k cones of let v d denote the set of d cones and let e denote the set of oriented d 1 cones regarded as ordered intersections of d cones i e 1 2 and 2 1 the pair v e defines a d valent graph for each oriented d 1 cone 1 2 choose and fix a normal vector r d pointing inside 1 i e x 0 for all x int 1 we can even choose our normal vectors so that the claim is that the function e r d 6 chris mcdaniel is a d independent axial function on clearly is d independent since the normal vectors of a d cone are a basis for rd to see that a 3 holds fix an oriented d 1 cone 1 2 and any other oriented edge issuing from 1 say 1 2 let and be rays i e one dimensional cones such that i i for i 1 2 then we have and there is a unique d 1 cone defined by define the connection map we observe that there are positive constants such that 1 c indeed the lhs of eq 1 necessarily vanishes on let be the ray determined by and choose any nonzero covector then defining 2 forces lhs of eq 1 to vanish on as well hence on all of thus lhs of eq 1 must be a multiple of thus the triple defines a d valent d independent 1 skeleton in rd a conewise linear function on is a continuous function f r whose restriction to every cone in is linear write f for the linear func tion that f restricts to on f is called strictly convex if for any two dis tinct cones and any x we have f x f x a standard result states that a complete simplicial fan admitting a strictly convex conewise linear function f r is the normal fan of a convex sim ple polytope p given as the convex hull of the points f for this reason a complete fan that admits a strictly convex conewise linear function is called polytopal note that for any oriented edge 1 2 we have 3 f 2 f 1 c for some positive scalar c indeed since f is continous f 2 and f 1 must agree on hence the lhs of eq 3 is some multiple of by the strict convexity condition for x 1 we have f 2 x f 1 x 0 hence the lhs is necessarily a positive multiple of thus a strictly convex conewise linear function on defines an embedding for remarks 1 the 1 skeleton corresponding to a complete simplicial polytopal fan is the 1 skeleton of a simple polytope in the usual sense 2 there are examples of complete simplicial non polytopal fans ful ton 2 pg 71 gives a 3 dimensional example associated to a smooth complete non projective toric variety fig 2 shows the cor responding 1 skeleton lifting 7 figure 2 no embedding non polytopal 2 2 subskeleta and holonomy fix a d valent 1 skeleton rn let p and q be vertices of a path from p to q is a sequence of vertices beginning with p and ending with q such that any two consecutive vertices in the path form an edge of a path from p to q is denoted by p q a loop is a path that begins and ends at the same vertex a subgraph of is a regular graph 0 v 0 e 0 where v 0 v and e 0 e if the connection on restricts to 0 in the sense that e ei e 0 et e 0 for every edge e e 0 we say the subgraph is totally geodesic the restriction of the connection and axial function to the totally geodesic subgraph 0 defines a 1 skeleton triple 0 0 0 called a subskeleton the 1 skeleton rn always admits a certain class of subskeleta called k slices for each k dimensional subspace h rn define h to be any connected component of the graph g vg eg determined by the condition that the edges directions lie in h i e eg e e e h and vg p v p i e e eg the claim is that the subgraph h has constant valency and is totally geodesic indeed fix e pq an oriented edge of h and let e p h denote the oriented edges at p lying in h let e e p h be any oriented edge at p different from e then e e must lie in the 2 plane generated by e and e by condition a 3 in definition 2 since e and e both lie in the subspace h e e must also lie in h hence e e e q h this shows that e e p h e q h and a similar argument shows that e e q h e p h since these maps are inverses of one another we see that e p h e q h and since h is connected it must therefore have constant valency the k faces of a simple polytope are k valent k slices of its correspond ing 1 skeleton note that a k slice of a 1 skeleton need not be k valent in general fix a subskeleton 0 0 0 an oriented edge not in e 0 but whose initial vertex lies in v 0 is normal to 0 the set of oriented normal 8 chris mcdaniel u v w x y z figure 3 non trivial normal holonomy edges to 0 will be denoted by n 0 for each vertex p v 0 the oriented edge set e p is partitioned into two pieces the oriented edges at p in 0 denoted e p 0 and those at p normal to 0 denoted n p 0 moreover since 0 is totally geodesic the connection also splits 0 the collection of maps pq n p 0 n q 0 pq e 0 define the normal connection for the subskeleton given any vertices p q v 0 and a path joining them in 0 p p 0 p j q define the path connection map for to be the composition k p j 1 p j p 0 p 1 e p 0 0 e p j 0 define the normal path connection map for to be the corresponding com positon of normal connection maps k p j 1 p j p 0 p 1 n p 0 0 n p j 0 for a loop the resp normal path connection map k gives a permuta tion of the set resp n p 0 e p 0 called a resp normal holonomy map definition 5 a subskeleton 0 0 0 has trivial normal holo nomy if the holonomy map k is trivial for all loops 0 the regular octahedron shown in fig 3 is a 4 valent 3 independent 1 skeleton whose triangular faces are 2 valent subskeleta with non trivial nor mal holonomy indeed the normal holonomy map for the loop u v w u applied to oriented edge ux gives k ux 7 vx 7 wy 7 uy on the other hand the k faces of a simple polytope always have trivial normal holonomy indeed a k face 0 containing vertex p is a k slice for the k dimensional subspace spanned by the set e p 0 then for any loop p p 1 pn p in 0 and for any edge e n p 0 condition a 3 implies that e and k e together with the spanning set e p 0 span a k 1 dimensional subspace thus by d independence of the set e p we must have k e e lifting 9 a b figure 4 polarized 1 skeleta figure 5 no polarization 2 3 polarizations and combinatorial betti numbers an orientation of is a choice of one orientation for each edge in the chosen oriented edge is called a directed edge for the orientation a path p q is said to be oriented with respect to a given orientation on if pi pi 1 is a directed edge for all i the orientation is called acyclic if there are no oriented loops a covector rn is generic for the 1 skeleton rn if it pairs nonzero with each edge direction i e e 0 for each e e a generic covector for induces an orientation on by declaring the directed edges to be those oriented edges that pair positively with see fig 4 definition 6 the generic covector is called polarizing if it induces an acyclic orientation on the 1 skeleton admits a polarization if it admits a generic polarizing covector note that a generic polarizing covector for is also generic and polarizing for any subskeleton 0 0 0 remark in 5 guillemin and zara use the term polarizing to describe what we call generic and what we call a polarizing covector they call a polarizing covector satisfying the no cycle condition a general 1 skeleton need not have a polarization at all e g fig 5 on the other hand if a 1 skeleton rn admits an embedding then every generic covector rn is polarizing indeed an embedded oriented 10 chris mcdaniel loop f p 0 f p 1 f pn f p 0 in would give an inconsistent system of inequalities f p 0 f p 1 f pn f p 0 guillemin and zara also make this observation in 4 definition 7 given a polarizing covector rn for we say an injective function v r is a morse function on compatible with if for each oriented edge pq e satisfying pq 0 we have p q as pointed out in 5 the existence of a polarizing covector guarantees the existence of a compatible morse function indeed just define p to be the length of the longest oriented path in that starts at p this is well defined since there are no oriented loops we can then perturb a little to make it injective definition 8 for p v define the index of p with respect to a generic covector to be the number of oriented edges flowing into p in other words ind p e ep e 0 define the ith combinatorial betti number of by bi p v ind p i while the index of a vertex of clearly depends on the generic covector an elegant argument due to bolker shows that the combinatorial betti numbers are actually independent of see 5 theorem 1 3 1 a vertex p 0 v with ind p 0 0 is called a source of for a generic covector if has a unique source for some hence every generic i e b 0 1 then we say that is pointed in fig 4 the 1 skeleton labeled a is pointed but the 1 skeleton labeled b is not guillemin and zara 5 introduced and studied a class of 3 independent 1 skeleta called noncyclic here is their definition definition 9 a 3 independent 1 skeleton rn is called non cyclic if the following conditions hold nc 1 rn admits a polarization nc 2 every 2 slice is pointed the class of 1 skeleta coming from simple polytopes or complete sim plicial polytopal fans is certainly noncyclic indeed any generic covector is polarizing since the 1 skeleton has an embedding and the 2 slices are convex polygons hence they are pointed fig 6 shows a 3 independent 1 skeleton that is not noncyclic lifting 11 2 3 1 example fans from 1 skeleta let r d be a complete simpli cial d dimensional fan with associated d valent d independent 1 skeleton r d for any genric covector r d there must be a unique vertex p 0 v such that e 0 for all e e p 0 corresponding to the unique d cone of containing thus is pointed it is straight forward to show that in fact every k slice of is pointed indeed a k slice h h h of corresponds to the star of some d k cone of the boundary of which is identified with a complete simplicial k dimensional fan via linear projection then the projection of a generic covector along the linear span of is identified with the restriction of the generic covector to h which must also be generic for h h h a d valent d independent 1 skeleton will be called toral if every k slice for 1 k d is pointed hence there is a correspondence between complete simplicial fans and toral 1 skeleta 4 complete simplicial fans in r d toral 1 skeleta in rd the claim is that 4 is bijective let denote a toral 1 skeleton in rd for each vertex p define the simplicial polyhedral cone xp u r d u e 0 e e p let denote the set of cones xp and all their faces in order to establish that is a complete simplicial fan in r d we need to show that 1 p v xp r d 2 xp xq is a face of both xp and xq to verify condition i note that the set of generic covectors for is a dense open set g r d and that each generic covector lies in some xp thus g p v xp r d and taking closures yields i to verify ii fix vertices p and q and let be the smallest face of xp containing xp xq de fine the k dimensional subspace h v rd u v 0 u let p h denote the graph of the k slice containing p and let q h denote the graph of the k slice containing q the claim is that p h q h otherwise the two k slices p h p h p h and q h q h q h are pointed by a common generic cov ector h let p 0 vh and q 0 v h be the respective sources note that there must exist a covector such that e 0 for all e n p 0 h n q 0 h indeed if this were not the case then there would exist at least one oriented 12 chris mcdaniel figure 6 embedded pointed not noncyclic edge e n p 0 h n q 0 h such that e 0 for all forcing e to lie in eh nh which is impossible extending h by zero to a covector in r d and adding to it the covector we get a generic covector such that e 0 for all e e p 0 eq 0 which is impossible since rd is pointed therefore p h q h h is a single k slice con taining both p and q now we want to show that xp xq fix u then u e 0 for all e e p h and u e 0 for all e n p h for pp 1 eh and e n p h we have by a 3 e pp 1 e pp 1 e r pp 1 thus u e pp 1 e u pp 1 e 0 implies that u pp 1 e 0 since h is connected we inductively conclude that u e 0 for all e nqh thus u xp xq hence xp xq is a face of xp a similar argument shows that xp xq is a face of xq this shows that is a complete simplicial d dimensional fan remarks 1 one can show that a noncyclic 3 independent 1 skeleton is always pointed the converse however is not true in general fig 6 shows a 3 independent embedded pointed 1 skeleton that is not noncyclic 2 it follows from i that a noncyclic d valent d independent 1 skeleton is always toral in particular the one to one correspondence in 4 restricts to a one to one correspondence between complete simpli cial polytopal fans in rd and d valent d independent noncyclic 1 skeleta admitting embeddings 3 it is unclear whether every toral 1 skeleton is noncylic in other words must every toral 1 skeleton admit a polarization 3 generalizations 3 1 generalized 1 skeleta fix a d valent graph connection pair definition 10 a compatibility system for e e e is a collection of maps e ei e r indexed by the oriented edges of that satisfy the lifting 13 rule e e 1 e for every e e the triple defines a pre 1 skeleton definition 11 a generalized axial function for the pre 1 skeleton is a map e r n that satisfies the following axioms ga 1 for each e e there is some me 0 such that e me e ga 2 for every e e and each e ei e e we have e e e e e r e the quadruple is a generalized 1 skeleton note that if the generalized axial function is 2 independent the compatibility system is uniquely determined if in addition the constants me are all equal to 1 in condition ga 1 then is actually an axial function and the quadruple defines a 1 skeleton it will be useful to have a notion of equivalence of generalized 1 skeleta definition 12 two generalized 1 skeleta rn and r n are equivalent if the graph connection pairs and are equal and there exists a function e r such that for every e e and e ei e we have 1 e e e and 2 e e e e e e e we will denote equivalence of generalized 1 skeleta by note that a 2 independent generalized 1 skeleton is equivalent to a 1 skeleton indeed fix any orientation of and let e denote the oriented edges oriented positively then define e 1 if e e 1 me if e e we will abuse the notation slightly and refer to a generalized 1 skeleton with a 2 independent axial function as a 1 skeleton the notions of subskeleton resp normal path connection map and resp normal holonomy have obvious generalized analogues addition ally the compatibility system of a generalized 1 skeleton allows one to as sign positive scalars to resp normal path connection maps fix a d valent generalized 1 skeleton and a k valent subskeleton 0 0 0 0 14 chris mcdaniel x y z figure 7 not level definition 13 let p p 0 p 1 p j 1 p j q be a path in 0 joining vertices p and q in v 0 the path connection number for is the product k e

the product k e j i 1 pi 1 pi pi 2 pi 1 p 0 p 1 e if is a loop replace the term path connection with the term holo nomy of particular interest will be those subskeleta whose local normal holo nomy numbers are trivial more precisely definition 14 a subskeleton 0 0 0 0 of a generalized 1 skeleton is level if for each e n p 0 and every loop in 0 such that k e e we have k e 1 in fig 7 the triangular subskeleton x y z x has trivial normal ho lonomy but is not level on the other hand the k faces of a simple polytope are always level indeed for face f and a fixed basepoint p 0 f let e be any edge normal to f at p 0 then there is a unique facet h containing f for which e is normal and h corresponds to a d 1 slice h h h then for any choice of nonzero covector r d normal to the hyperplane span h rd the compatibility constants around the edges of h are given by the formula pq e e pq e as in eq 2 thus the local normal lifting 15 holonomy numbers associated to a loop p 0 p 1 pn p 0 are given by k e e p 0 p 1 e pn 1 pn p 0 p 1 e k e 1 the notions of polarizations compatible morse functions and combina torial betti numbers also have obvious generalized analogues we will see presently that the blow up reduction and cutting constructions from 5 also have generalized analogues the exposition in 5 is closely followed subsections 3 2 3 3 2 3 3 3 and 3 4 are generalized analogues of respec tively subsections 2 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 2 and 2 4 1 in 5 3 2 blow up fix a d valent generalized 1 skeleton with connection r n and let 0 0 0 0 be a k valent subskeleton we set up the following notation as a convention to be used throughout this subsection let p q r v 0 denote arbitrary vertices with pq pr e 0 let e e e n p 0 denote arbi trary edges at p normal to 0 and set f f f n q 0 and g g g nr 0 such that pq e i f i and pr e i g i for 0 i 2 for a subset of oriented edges e e set e e e e we will define a new graph v e by cutting off 0 in and re placing it with a new d 1 valent sub graph define the new vertex set v 0 z p e p v 0 e n p 0 define the vertex set of to be v v v 0 v 0 define the new edge sets n 0 z p e t e p v 0 e n p 0 and e 0 z p e z p e z p e z q f define the edge set of by e e e 0 n 0 n 0 n 0 n 0 e 0 note that oriented edge sets n 0 and n 0 are in one to one correspondence with n 0 and n 0 thus it is clear that the vertices x v v 0 v including vertices x t e e n 0 are incident to exactly d oriented edges also the vertices z p e v 0 v are incident to the d edges z p e z p e e n p 0 e z p e z q f pq e 0 z p e t e hence is a d valent graph called the blow up graph of along 0 the natural map of sets v v x q if x q v v 0 p if x zpe for some e n 0 p extends to a map of graphs called the blow down map 16 chris mcdaniel p q r g e f t e zrg z p e z q f z p e z p e figure 8 blow up along a subskeleton the induced subgraph of on the vertex set 1 v 0 v 0 denoted by 0 is a d 1 valent connected subgraph called the singular locus of the blow up for each vertex x in the singular locus v 0 define the horizontal edges at x to be the edges in the singular locus at x preserved by i e e 0 h x 1 e 0 x define the vertical edges at x to be those edges destroyed by i e e vx e 0 x e 0 h x we want to define a connection and compatibility system on to avoid confusion we will use the letter to denote an edge in and reserve the letter e for an edge in for oriented edges not issuing from the singular locus 0 define 1 5 6 the values of and on oriented edges in n 0 and e 0 are listed in tables 1 and 2 from eqs 5 6 and tables 1 2 it is straight forward to check that the triple defines a pre 1 skeleton on oriented edges not issuing from the singular locus of define 7 in order to extend the function to the remaining oriented edges issuing from the singular locus we must assume the existence of a system of pos itive scalar assignments to the normal edges of 0 n n 0 r satisfying lifting 17 table 1 values z p e t e z p e z r g z p e z p e z p

the levelness of 0 0 0 0 guaran tees the existence of a blow up system indeed fixing a basepoint p 0 v 0 and setting n e 1 for all e n p 00 one can use the normal path connection and the normal path connection numbers to extend n to nx 0 for any other x v 0 simply take any path p 0 x joining p 0 to x in 0 then for any e nx 0 there is e n p 0 0 such that e k e thus the function n e 1 k e is independent of the path and hence defines the required blow up system we use a fixed blow up system n n 0 r for 0 0 0 0 to define on e 0 n 0 as shown in table 3 clearly satisfies ga 1 in definition 11 it remains to show that satisfies ga 2 9 0 mod it is straight forward to verify ga 2 for oriented edges not issuing from the singular locus indeed in this case eq 9 becomes c 18 chris mcdaniel table 3 values z p e t e 1 n e e z p e z q f pq z p e z p e e n e n e e which holds since is a generalized axial function for the pair thus it suffices to verify eq 9 for oriented edges issuing from the

forward and their verification is left to the reader thus is a generalized axial function for the pre 1 skeleton definition 15 the generalized 1 skeleton is called the blow up of along the subskeleton 0 0 0 0 remark the blow up construction for 1 skeleta was introduced by guillemin and zara 5 however the assumptions on the 1 skeleta made in 5 are a bit more restrictive than those we make here in particular they assume that 1 is 3 independent and 2 the compatibility constants along the normal edges n 0 are all equal to 1 i e e e 1 for e e 0 and e ni e 0 note that if condition 2 holds then 0 0 0 0 is level and if condition 1 holds then the function is actually 2 independent 3 3 reduction lifting 19 figure 9 not enough 2 faces 3 3 1 2 faces and reducible 1 skeleta for 3 independent non cyclic 1 skeleta every 2 slice is a convex polygon and in 5 these polygons are used to de fine the edges of cross sections unfortunately without the 3 independence condition some of these polygons may not show up as 2 slices fortunately we can recover these hidden polygons using the connection and a polar ization definition 16 a k face of a polarized generalized 1 skeleton is a k valent subskeleton 0 0 0 0 with b 0 0 0 1 for example the 2 faces of a 3 independent noncyclic 1 skeleton are ex actly its 2 valent 2 slices definition 17 we say that a polarized generalized 1 skeleton has enough k faces if for each vertex p v and any subset of k edges e 1 ek e p there is a unique k face containing e 1 ek the 1 skeleton shown in fig 9 equipped with the connection making the outer hexagon a 2 face does not have enough 2 faces on the other hand the 1 skeleton of a simple polytope always has enough k faces definition 18 a 1 skeleton rn is called reducible if r 1 it admits a polarization and r 2 it has enough 2 faces in the 3 independent case the notion of noncyclic and reducible coincide we will see presently that the reduction construction from 5 applies to reducible 1 skeleta and yields cross sections that are generalized 1 skeleta 3 3 2 cross sections for what follows it will be useful to keep track of the compatibility system of a 1 skeleton so we shall include this in the notation fix a d valent reducible 1 skeleton in rn with generic polarizing covector rn fix a compatible morse function v r and a regular value c r a 2 face q is a loop which comes with two distinct orientations for a fixed basepoint p 0 q we have q p 0 p 1 pn p 0 q p 0 pn p 1 p 0 an oriented 2 face is a 2 face with a fixed orientation let f 2 denote the 20 chris mcdaniel set of oriented 2 faces of each oriented 2 face q comes with a maximum vertex and a minimum vertex m q max v q v and m q min v q v define the c vertex set vc to be the oriented edges of at c level vc pq e p c q define the c oriented edge set ec to be the ori ented 2 faces of at c level ec q f 2 m q c m q the condition b 0 q 1 implies that exactly two oriented edges in q lie at c level moreover exactly one of these oriented edges is a directed edge via compatible with the orientation on q this directed edge is the initial c vertex of the oriented c edge q hence the set ec consists of ordered pairs of c vertices and the pair vc ec defines a d 1 valent graph denoted by c the normal path connection maps are used to define a connection on c in fact there are two natural connections on c corresponding to the two paths around q joining its c vertices fix q ec and suppose i q pq and t q vw as in fig 10 define the upper path from q to w 12 uq q r 1 r 2 rk 1 rk w meaning that ri c for 1 i k analogously define the lower path from p to v 13 dq p t 1 t 2 tm 1 tm v meaning that t j c for 1 j m since has enough 2 faces the oriented edges normal to q e n q q are in one to one correspondence with oriented c edges distinct from q re ec pq q thus the normal path connection maps for the upper path resp lower path define the up connection resp down connection maps for c 14 ec pq q uc q ec vw q n q 0 k u q nw 0 the down connection maps are defined analogously replacing k uq with k dq n p 0 n v 0 clearly the maps uc q resp dc q define a connection uc resp d c on c called the up connection resp down connection see fig 10 lifting 21 uk uk 1 u 2 u 1 s 1 s 2 sm 1 sm r 1 q r 2 rk 1 w rk v tm tm 1 t 2 t 1 p uq dq w q r uc q r figure 10 c cross section just as we used path connection maps to define the connection on c we use the path connection numbers to define a compatibility system on c define the up compatibility maps by 15 ec pq q uc q r n q 0 k u q 44 where the lower map is defined by e 7 k u q e as in definition 13 define the down compatibility maps analogously replacing k u q with k dq n p 0 r observe that for every oriented c edge q ec and every re ec pq we have uc q u c q re k u q k u q e 1 k u q e 1 uc q re hence uc defines a compatiblity system for the pair c c and similarly for dc therefore we have two possibly distinct pre 1 skeleta with the same underlying graph c namely c u c u c and c d c d c 22 chris mcdaniel for each pre 1 skeleton defined above we can define a compatible gen eralized axial function on c as follows let w r n denote the subspace annihilated by denote by 2 r n the vector space of alternating two tensors generated by elements of the form x y y x for x y rn let 2 r n rn denote the interior product map defined by x y x y y x as above let q ec be an oriented c edge with i q pq and t q vw let uj q r 1 r 2 r j be the partial upper path in q from q to r j and dj p t 1 t 2 t j the partial lower path in q from p to t j then u k uq q rk w and dm d q p tm v as above our convention will be to let p r 0 and v rk 1 and to let q t 0 and w tm 1 define the function uc ec w by 16 uc q r 1 r 0 r 1 r 2 r 1 r 0 similarly define the function dc ec w by 17 dc q t 1 t 0 t 1 t 2 t 1 t 0 an elegant argument due to guillemin and zara 5 theorem 2 3 1 applies verbatim to show that the function uc resp d c defines a generalized axial function for the pre 1 skeleton c u c u c resp c d c d c we refer the reader to 5 for the details thus we get two possibly distinct generalized 1 skeleta structures on the d 1 valent graph c the up c cross section of c u c u c u c and the down c cross section of c d c d c d c an important component to the reduction technique is understanding what happens to cross sections as they pass over critical values a beau tiful description in the noncyclic case involving a blow up construction was given in 5 it turns out such a description is also valid in the reducible case 3 3 3 passage over a critical value let be a d valent reducible 1 skeleton in rn fix a polarizing covector rn and a compatible morse function fix two regular values c c such that there is a unique vertex p v satisfying c p c suppose that ind p r and let vc 0 pi p 1 i r lifting 23 denote those edges flowing into p i e pi p 0 for 1 i r let vc 0 pqa 1 a d r denote the oriented edges flowing out of p i e pqa 0 for 1 a d r consider the up c cross section c u c u c u c the set of oriented edges vc 0 vc is the c vertex set of a totally geodesic complete subgraph c 0 c denote by qia the oriented 2 face spanned by oriented edges ppi and pqa with initial c vertex ppi the set of oriented c edges normal to c 0 is denoted by nc 0 qia 1 a d r 1 i r the function 18 nc 0 nu r qia pqa defines a blow up system for uc u c u c u c along u c 0 u c 0 u c 0 u c 0 in deed for all i j and a we have 19 nu qia nu uc qi j qia nu qia nu q ja 1 uc qi j qia we can therefore blow up along the subskeleton to get the generalized 1 skeleton c u c uc uc similarly we can blow up the down c cross section c d c d c d c along the d r valent totally geodesic subskeleton c 0 d c 0 d c 0 d c 0 here the c vertex set of c 0 is the oriented edge set vc 0 and the oriented c edges normal to c 0 are the oriented 2 faces spanned by oriented edges ppi and pqa denoted by qai with i qai pqa in this case the function 20 nc 0 nd r qai pi p forms a blow up system for c d c d c d c along the subskeleton c 0 d c 0 d c 0 d c 0 for similar reasons as above for all a b and i we have 21 nd qai nu d c qab qai nd qai nd qbi 1 dc qab qai we can therefore blow up along the subskeleton to get the

mcdaniel qa qb qc p pi pj qia qai c c figure 11 passage over a critical point the axial functions are positive multiples of one another unfortunately this statement fails to hold without further assumptions when one considers the whole generalized 1 skeleta quadruple including connections and compati bility systems the following lemma is an analogue of theorem 2 3 2 in 5 lemma 1 assume that all 2 faces in ec ec are level and have trivial normal holonomy then we have the following equivalences of 1 skeleta i c u c u c u c c d c d c d c ii c u c uc uc c d c dc dc proof first we establish i fix oriented 2 faces q and r as shown in fig 10 let uq resp d q be as in eq 12 resp 13 identify the oriented c edges at i q pq with the oriented edges normal to q at p resp q i e ec pq q n p q resp n

q qp nwq vw n p q k d q nvq ec pq q dc q ec vw q the vertical maps compose to the identity maps on ec pq q and ec vw q the top and bottom squares commute by definition i e eq 14 and the commutativity of the middle square follows from the trivial normal holo nomy of q thus the outer rectangle commutes which implies the equiva lence of uc and d c using eqs 16 and 17 and that qr 2 qp qr 2 pt 2 c qp c

qu 1 n 0 q and ps 1 n 0 p then the levelness of q implies k dq ps 1 qp qu 1 wv k uq qu 1 k uq qu 1 from which it follows that dc q r r uc q r uc q r 26 chris mcdaniel now we establish ii there is a natural identification of the vertices which extends to an identification of graphs c and c 22 vc vc 0 vc vc 0 zia zai note that c vertices outside the singular locus of c coincide with the c vertices outside the singular locus of c indeed oriented edges not con taining p are at c level if and only if they are at c level also note that eq 22 identifies horizontal edges of c 0 with vertical edges of c 0 and vice versa in order to establish ii we need to show a uc dc b uc uc dc c uc dc note that for oriented edges not issuing from the singular locus of either c or c the blow up connection maps compatibility systems and general ized axial functions coincide with their counter parts on c or c cf eqs 5 6 and 7 therefore by i it suffices to establish a b and c for oriented edges issuing from the singular locus of c c a direct comparison of values in table 4 shows that uc dc hence a holds tables 5 and 6 compare the compatibility systems and generalized axial functions on c and c in table 6

thus we deduce that the values of that make c hold are as shown in table 7 the verification that b also holds with defined by table 7 is straight forward and is left to the reader this establishes the equivalence in ii and thereby completes the proof of lemma 1 3 4 cutting let be a d valent reducible 1 skeleton in rn a polarizing covector in rn and a compatible morse function let i 0 1 01 10 denote the interval graph i e connected single edge graph and let i denote the unique connection on i then i 1 defines a compatibility system on i i and the function i 01 7 1 10 7 1 defines an axial function making the quadruple i i i i a 1 skeleton in r the direct product 1 skeleton rn rwith factors r n and i i i i r is a d 1 valent 1 skeleton defined as follows the graph has vertex set v v 0 v 1 and oriented edge set e e vi v ei the connection maps are defined as the product of the connection maps of the factors i e i et the compatibility system maps lifting 29 are likewise the product of the compatibility system maps of the factors i e i r the product axial function is e r n r e v e 0 v e 0 1 let 1 r denote the linear functional on r that maps 1 to 1 define the covector 1 rn r rn r then is generic and polariz ing for since e v e v e 1 i e also note that has enough 2 faces 2 faces are either q v for q a 2 face of or rectangles e e thus is reducible set minp v p and maxp v p and fix a 0 define a compatible morse function by v r v t v at lemma 2 in the notation above if satisfies in theorem 1 then the direct product 1 skeleton also satisfies moreover if c r is any regular value such that c a then there is a linear isomorphism w r n that yields an equivalence of 1 skeleta c d c d c d c proof using the notation above assume that satisfies the direct product has two types of 2 faces i 2 faces of the form q v for q a 2 face of ii rectangles of the form e e for e e and e ei clearly 2 faces of type i are level with trivial normal holonomy since the agrees with and agrees with on q v let f pq 01 be a 2 face of type ii and let f denote the loop p 0 q 0 q 1 p 1 p 0 then the normal holonomy map k f has the form k f i 10 qp i 01 pq 30 chris mcdaniel which is clearly the identity map on n p 0 f moreover the normal holonomy number has the form k f i 10 qp i 01 pq which is identically one on n p 0 f this shows that holds for to establish the equivalence of with the down c cross section of first note that the oriented edges at c level are those of the form v 01 indeed all vertices of the form p 0 have p 0 p c and all vertices of the form q 1 have q 1 q a a c similarly the oriented 2 faces at c level are the oriented rectangles of the form e 01 this defines a bijection between graphs and c v e v c e c v v 01 e e 01 the down connection map dc e 01 k e is simply equal to

the vanishing hyperplane of w is a linear isomorphism such that d c 4 application projecting and lifting 1 skeleta 4 1 projections of 1 skeleta fix a d valent pre 1 skeleton let a e r n be an effective generalized axial function and let p rn rn be any surjective linear map then p a is also an effective generalized axial function for and the resulting generalized 1 skeleton p a is called the projection of a lifting 31 w c figure 12 cutting figure 13 projection conversely we say a generalized 1 skeleton in rn has a lift if there is an effective generalized 1 skeleton a in rn n n d and a surjective linear map p rn rn such that p a we say has a total lift if it has a lift to an effective generalized 1 skeleton a in rd note that an effective axial function a e r d for a d valent pre 1 skeleton is necessarily d independent for the convenience of the reader we restate theorem 1 here theorem 1 let rn be a d valent reducible 1 skeleton in rn then has a total lift if and only if every 2 face of is level and has trivial normal holonomy note that a total lift a of a reducible 1 skeleton is necessarily reducible indeed any generic covector rn for pulls back via the projection p rd rn to a generic covector p r d for a satisfying a e e since a and have the same connection and polarization they must also have the same 2 faces 4 2 proof of theorem 1 before proving theorem 1 we will need the following lemmata the first lemma asserts that total liftability is preserved by a blow up or a blow down fix a d valent generalized 1 skeleton in rn a k valent level subskeleton 0 0 0 0 and a blow up system for the subskeleton n n 0 r let denote the corresponding blow up generalized 1 skeleton 32 chris mcdaniel lemma 3 has a total lift if and only if has a total lift proof let a be a total lift of via a surjective map p rd r n then the function a e rd defined as in definition 15 is an ax ial function for moreover the linearity of p guarantees that p a finally note that a e e e p and a e e e p coincide for p v 0 thus since a is d independent a must also be d independent conversely let a be a total lift of via a surjective map p rd rn in order to define a total lift a e r d for it suffices to see that a is constant on the fibers of the blow up morphism indeed if a is constant on the fibers 1 e for each e e 0 then the function a e r d given by 23 a e n e a z p e t e if e n 0 a if e e n 0 and 1 e is well defined fix a vertex p v oriented edges e e e p and consider the difference 24 a e e e a e e fix 1 e and 1 e for e n 0 eq 24 becomes n e a e e n e e a n e a 1 a which is a multiple of a 1 n e a e for e n 0 eq 24 becomes a a which is also a multiple of a a e thus eq 23 defines a generalized axial function for moreover it is clear that a is d independent since a is d independent and that p a thus it remains to see that a is constant on 1 e for each e e 0 fix e e 0 and let be any two edges in the fiber 1 e we need to show that a a if and are not distinct there is nothing to show otherwise and are distinct edges in the same fiber hence there must be a vertical edge joining the vertices i and i thus we have 25 a a ca for some c r the claim is that c 0 to see this apply the projection p to both sides of 25 to get 26 c lifting 33 since 1 and we deduce that the lhs of 26 must be zero this implies that c must also be equal to zero as desired the next lemma asserts that any down cross section of a reducible 1 skeleton satisfying must have a total lift see fig 14 lemma 4 let be a d valent reducible 1 skeleton satisfying in theorem 1 a polarizing covector for and a compatible morse function then for any regular value c r the d 1 valent generalized 1 skeleton c d c d c d c has a total lift proof let c 0 c 1 cn cn 1 be regular values such that for each p v c 0 p cn 1 and for each 0 i n there is a unique ver tex pi v satisfying ci pi ci 1 to complete the proof it suffices to show that c 1 d c 1 dc 1 d c 1 has a total lift indeed inductively assume that ci d ci d ci d ci has a total lift since all 2 faces are level with trivial normal holonomy lemma 1 implies that ci u ci uci u ci ci d ci dci d ci hence ci u ci uci u ci must also have a total lift by lemma 3 the blow up ci u ci uci uci has a total lift again lemma 1 implies that ci u ci uci uci ci 1 d ci 1 dci 1 dci 1 hence ci 1 d ci 1 dci 1 dci 1 has a total lift as well hence by lemma 3 again ci 1 d ci 1 dci 1 d ci 1 must also have a lift and so on note that the graph of the c 1 cross section c 1 d c 1 dc 1 d c 1 is a com plete graph on d vertices for concreteness set p p 0 the unique source e p pqi 1 i d vc 1 the c 1 vertices and ec 1 qi j the oriented c 1 edges where qi j is the oriented 2 face spanned by the oriented edges i qi j pqi and t qi j pq j note that the down connection on c 1 gives d c qi j qik q jk for all 1 i j k d also by definition the compatibility system gives dc 1 qi j qik 1 for all 1 i j k d define constants mi j pqi pq j 1 i j d for all 1 i j k d we have dc 1 qi j m ji d c 1 q ji 27 dc 1 qik d c 1 q jk mk j d c 1 qi j 28 34 chris mcdaniel p figure 14 a commutative diagram indeed the lhs of eq 28 gives pqi pqk pqi pq j pqk pq j pqk pq j pq j pqk pqi pqi mk j pq j pq j pqi pqi which yields the rhs the verification of eq 27 is left to the reader note that any function a e pq 1 c 1 r d 1 that maps e pq 1 c 1 q 12 q 13 q 1 d onto a basis extends to a generalized d independent axial function a ec 1 r d 1 via the relations in eqs 27 and 28 moreover dc 1 p a where p rd 1 rn 1 is the surjective map mapping the basis vector a q 1 i to the vector q 1 i we are now in a position to explicitly write down a proof of theorem 1 proof of theorem 1 assume a is a total lift of and let q be a 2 face with normal edges nq e fix a base point p 0 in q and let q p 0 p 1 pm p 0 denote the loop in q based at p 0 note that the d independence of a implies that q is actually a 2 slice for some 2 dimensional subspace h rd now for any edge e n p 0 q the subspace lifting 35 spanned by a e and h must necessarily contain the vector a k q e hence by d independence of a we must have k q e e hence q has trivial normal holonomy to compute the local normal holonomy number for an oriented edge e nq choose and fix a covector r d vanishing on the subspace h but not vanishing on a e then for e q at i e we have 29 e e e e e e h span a e a e span a e by d independence of a we deduce that e e e e e and thus readily conclude that k q 1 conversely let be reducible d valent 1 skeleton in rn whose 2 faces are all level with trivial normal holonomy then by lemma 2 there is a d 1 valent 1 skeleton in rn r that is reducible via the covector 1 rn r and that also satisfies moreover lemma 2 tells us that c d c d c d c for some linear isomorphism w r n by lemma 4 c d c d c d c must have a total lift and hence so must c d c d c d c thus also has a total lift this establishes theorem 1 the proof of corollary 1 which characterizes 1 skeleta of projected sim ple polytopes appeals to a result of guillemin and zara dealing with the equivariant cohomology ring of a 1 skeleton and its generating families we refer the reader to 5 for definitions and further details regarding these concepts corollary 1 a d valent 1 skeleton is the 1 skeleton of a pro jected simple polytope if and only if is reducible all its 2 faces are level with trivial normal holonomy and it admits an embedding f v r n proof assume is the 1 skeleton of a projected simple d polytope s rd via projection p rd rn then the 1 skeleton of s a is a total lift of with respect to p rd rn thus by theorem 1 all 2 faces of are level with trivial normal holonomy moreover the natural embedding vs f r d v v of a composes with the projection p to give an embedding f p f e r n of 36 chris mcdaniel conversely assume that is a d valent reducible 1 skeleton in r n whose 2 faces are level with trivial normal holonomy and that admits an embedding f v r n then by theorem 1 has a total lift a rd with respect to some projection p rd rn since a is a d valent d independent noncyclic 1 skeleton theorem 2 4 4 in 5 asserts that its equivariant cohomology ring admits a generating fam ily q q v h a but the classes p q q v h are a generat ing family for the equivariant cohomology ring of the projection this implies that composition with the projection p rd rn defines a surjective map on equivariant cohomology rings h a p h g p g since f h 1 there must exist f h 1 a satisfying f p f by linearity of p f v r d must be an embedding of a hence a a d valent d independent noncyclic 1 skeleton with an embed ding is the 1 skeleton of a simple d polytope 5 concluding remarks theorem 1 classifies projections of reducible i e noncyclic d valent d independent 1 skeleta using morse theoretic ideas it is natural to ask if these same ideas could be applied toward classifying projections of re ducible d valent k independent 1 skeleta for k 3 we observe that for k 3 the 2 faces of a k independent 1 skeleton rn are neces sarily level indeed fix a 2 face q a basepoint vertex p q and edges e 1 e 2 e p q that span q then for any normal edge to q at p e n p q we have 30 e e 1 e e 1 e r e 1 since is 3 independent we can find a covector rn that vanishes on e 1 e 2 but not on e applying to both sides of 30 and solving for we find that 31 e 1 e e e 1 e thus if q is a loop around q satisfying k q e e then eq 31 implies that the local normal holonomy number k q is equal to 1 in fact for k 4 the 2 faces of a k independent 1 skeleton rn must not only be level but must also have trivial normal holonomy indeed lifting 37 with q p q e 1 e 2 e p q and e n p q as above consider the four vectors e 1 e 2 e and k q e note that these four vectors must all lie in the same 3 dimensional subspace span e 1 e 2 e on the other hand if k q e and e are distinct then the four vectors must be linearly independent since is 4 independent thus k q e e and q has trivial normal holonomy thus besides corollary 1 theorem 1 has the following perhaps surprising consequence corollary every d valent 4 independent noncyclic 1 skeleton has a total lift therefore every 1 skeleton projection of a 4 independent noncyclic 1 skeleton is in fact a projection of a d independent noncyclic 1 skeleton in contrast there are definitely 3 independent noncyclic 1 skeleta that do not admit a total lift for example the 1 skeleton in fig 3 is 3 independent noncyclic but its triangular 2 faces have non trivial normal holonomy the following problem remains problem classify the 1 skeleton projections of 3 independent noncyclic 1 skeleta if is a projection of a 3 independent noncyclic 1 skeleton it must be reducible and its 2 faces must be level a first naive conjecture would be that these conditions are also sufficient although a counterexam ple seems more likely problem find an example of a reducible 1 skeleton with level 2 faces that is not the projection of a noncyclic 3 independent 1 skeleton as mentioned in the remarks in section 2 it is unclear if every toral 1 skeleton is noncyclic problem find an example of a toral 1 skeleton that does not admit a po larizing covector given a polarizing covector on a toral 1 skeleton in rd and a compatible morse function the induced linear ordering of the vertices defines a shelling order on the d cones of the corresponding fan as far as the author knows showing that every complete simplicial fan has a shelling order is an open problem 7 pg 277 using the dictionary between 1 skeleta and gkm manifolds e g 6 ap pendix b it would be interesting to know if there is an analogue of the orem 1 in geometry for example what are necessary and sufficient con ditions for an effective hamiltonian t s 1 n action on a symplectic 2 d dimensional manifold to extend to a
