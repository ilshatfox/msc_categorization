birthday abstract in 1980 arnold studied the classification problem for convex lattice poly gons of given area since then this problem and its high dimensional analogue have been studied by ba ra ny pach vershik and others bounds for the number of non equivalent d dimensional convex lattice polytopes of given volume have been achieved in this paper we study arnold s problem for centrally symmetric lattice polygons and the classification problem for convex lattice polytopes of given cardinality in the plane we obtain analogues to the bounds of arnold ba ra ny and pach in both cases how ever the number of non equivalent d dimensional convex lattice polytopes of w lattice points is infinite whenever w 1 d 3 which may intuitively contradict to ba ra ny and vershik s upper bound 2000 mathematics subject classification 52 b 20 52 c 35 1 introduction a convex lattice polytope in ed is the convex hull of a finite subset of the integer lattice z d equivalently it is a convex polytope all vertices of which are in zd one of the first results about lattice polygons was discovered by g pick in 1899 which is known as pick s theorem in 1967 e ehrhart discovered his polynomiality theorem in recent years ehrhart s polynomials have attracted the attention of many authors see 7 11 or 12 in fact up to now the knowledge about convex lattice polytopes is still very limited see 9 and 10 let p denote a d dimensional convex lattice polytope let v p denote the volume of p and let p denote the cardinality of p zd let p 1 and p 2 be two d dimensional lattice polytopes if there is a z d preserving affine transformation satisfying p 2 p 1 then we say p 1 and p 2 are equivalent for convenience we write p 1 p 2 for short it is easy to see that if p 1 p 2 and p 2 p 3 then we have p 1 p 3 in addition if p 1 p 2 then we have v p 1 v p 2 and p 1 p 2 1 the second author is supported by 973 program 2011 cb 302400 the national natural science foundation of china grant no 11071003 the chang jiang scholars program of china and lmam at peking university 1 http arxiv org abs 1103 0103 v 3 clearly the equivalence relation divides convex lattice polytopes into different classes using triangulations it can be easily shown that d v p z holds for any d dimensional convex lattice polytope p let v d m denote the number of different classes of the d dimensional convex lattice polytopes p with v p m d where both d and m are positive integers in 1980 arnold 2 studied the values of v 2 m and proved m 1 3 log v 2 m m 1 3 logm 1 remark 1 in this paper f d m g d m means that for fixed positive integer d f d m cd g d m holds for all positive integers m with a suitable constant cd in 1992 ba ran y and pach 5 improved arnold s upper bound by removing the logm term ba ra ny and vershik 6 obtained a general upper bound log v d m m d 1 d 1 2 in the literature some citations on v d m are confusing we will clarify the situation in section 3 let v d m denote the number of different classes of the d dimensional centrally symmetric convex lattice polytopes p with v p m d let d w denote the number of different classes of d dimensional convex lattice polytopes p with p w and let d w denote the number of different classes of d dimensional centrally symmetric convex lattice polytopes p with p w then we have v d m 0 whenever m is odd and d w 0 if w is even therefore in this paper we assume that the m in v d m is even and the w in d w is odd in this paper we study arnold s problem for the centrally symmetric lattice poly gons and the classification problem for convex lattice polytopes of given cardinality in section 2 we introduce a basic lemma on the structures of convex lattice polytopes in section 3 we review the known results about v d m and prove m 1 3 log v 2 m m 1 3 in section 4 we prove w 1 3 log 2 w w 1 3 and w 1 3 log 2 w w 1 3 in section 5 we show that d w whenever d 3 and w d 1 which may intuitively contradict to 2 about v d m and log d w w d 1 d 1 2 2 rabinowitz s lemma in this section we introduce a basic result about the structures of convex lattice poly topes which will be useful in section 4 the result was discovered by s rabinowitz in 1989 and was published at utilitas mathematica since the result is elegant and the journal is hard to find we reproduce its proof here lemma 1 20 let p be a d dimensional convex lattice polytope and let m be a natural number satisfying p md 1 then p has at least m 1 collinear lattice points proof consider the coordinates of the integer points modulo m since there are only md distinct d tuples of integers modulo m some two points x and y of p zd must be congruent mod m in other words for all i 1 2 d we have xi yi 0 mod m by convexity all the m 1 collinear lattice points x j m y x j 0 1 2 m belong to p the lemma is proved 3 arnold s problem in this section we review the known results about v d m and prove m 1 3 log v 2 m m 1 3 let p denote the cardinality of the vertices of p to prove the upper bound in 1 arnold 2 showed that p v p 1 3 3 holds for all two dimensional convex lattice polygons in 1984 konyagin and sev astyanov 15 generalized 3 to d dimensions by proving p v p d 1 d 1 4 in fact this upper bound was first achieved by andrews 1 in 1965 at the end of 2 arnold made a remark that in zd 1 3 is probably replaced by d 1 d 1 proof of the lower bound let x 21 x 2 d 1 xd a therefore the following problem is cited as arnold s question in the literature see 3 and 4 to investigate v d m and to determine the order of magnitude of log v d m in 1992 ba ra ny and pach 5 improved arnold s upper bound to log v 2 m m 13 5 ba ra ny and vershik 6 generalized 5 to d dimensions by proving log v d m m d 1 d 1 6 3 in 6 the authors attributed log v d m m d 1 d 1 7 and log v d m m d 1 d 1 logm to 2 and 15 respectively in fact neither of them contains such proofs in particular a proof for 7 seems non trivial therefore to determine the order of magnitude of log v d m for fixed d and large m is still a basic open problem in 3 and 4 it was concluded that log m j 1 v d j m d 1 d 1 and attributed this lower bound to arnold 2 unfortunately a rigorous proof is missing as well to estimate v 2 m we have the following result theorem 1 when m is even and sufficiently large we have m 1 3 log v 2 m m 1 3 to prove this theorem we need the following technical lemma lemma 2 let t denote the lattice triangle with vertices o 0 and 0 let s denote the lattice square with vertices o 0 and 0 and let k be an integer with k 2 then there is a convex lattice polygon p satisfying both t p s and v p 1 2 2 k proof let pj denote the convex lattice pentagon with vertices o 0 1 1 j j and 0 let hi j denote the hexagon with vertices o 0 i 1 2 i j j i and 0 and let h i j denote the hexagon with vertices o 0 i 1 j 2 i j 2 i and 0 then we have v pj 1 2 2 j j 0 1 1 v hi j 1 2 2 2 i i 2 i j j 0 1 2 i and v h i j 1 2 2 2 i i 3 i 2 j j 0 1 2 i it follows that the sequence v p 0 v p 1 v p 1 v h 0 0 v h 0 1 v h 0 2 v h 0 1 v h 0 2 v h 1 0 v h 1 1 v h 1 3 v h 1 1 v h 1 3 v h 2 0 v s is exactly the sequence 1 2 2 k k 1 2 4 this proves the assertion proof of theorem 1 the upper bound follows from 5 and the fact that v 2 m v 2 m next we prove the lower bound by modifying arnold s ingenious method let be a positive number and let q denote the set of all primitive integer vectors in the domain x y x 2 y 2 2 x 0 y 0 one has v q v for a suitable integer then we take v 0 0 v 0 0 and define v v 0 q v 0 let m denote the convex lattice polygon whose oriented sides are all vectors in v starting from v 0 and ending with v 0 see figure 1 m q o o v 0 figure 1 it is well known in number theory see 14 p 125 that q 3 2 2 o log 8 the convex lattice polygon m has following properties 1 it has v vertices 2 let c be the unit circular disc and let d c x y x y 0 be the non negative quadrant of c let r be the largest number such that rd m and let r be the smallest number such that m r d it can be easily deduced from 8 that 3 r r 3 9 5 3 each side except the two longest contains no other integral point except the ends 4 the polygon m changes only when 2 passes through integral values and v m 1 v m c holds for some constant c this inequality can be deduced from property 2 we will now construct polygons pi that are assembled with the help of smaller polygons p 1 i p 2 i p 3 i and p 4 i for convenience we enumerate the short sides of 2 m by s 1 s 2 s q in anti clockwise order it follows by property 3 that each of these sides say si has three integral points p 0 i p 1 i and p 2 i in this order then p 0 1 2 0 p 0 i p 2 i 1 and p 2 q 0 2 for each vector u i 1 i 2 i q 1 1 2 q 1 we obtain a convex lattice polygon p 1 u conv o p 01 p i 1 1 p i 2 2 p i q 1 q 1 p 2 q and clearly the lattice polygons p 1 u p 1 v differ for distinct u v 1 2 q 1 so we obtain 2 q 1 convex lattice polygons for sake of simplicity we enumerate them by p 11 p 1 2 p 1 2 q 1 and denote the set of these polygons by p 1 it follows by property 3 that 1 2 v p 1 i v 2 m 1 p 1 i p 1 let denote the lattice triangle with vertices 0 0 0 2 and 2 0 let m be an even integer and choose to be the largest number satisfying v 2 m v 5 m 4 10 then v p 1 i 2 2 5 m 4 holds for all p 1 i p 1 therefore for each p 1 i there are a positive integer j and a corresponding number i with i 5 satisfying m 4 v p 1 i 2 2 4 j i 11 by lemma 2 one can extend to a lattice polygon p 2 i contained in the square with vertices 0 0 0 2 2 0 and 2 2 and satisfying v p 2 i 2 2 i 12 then we define p 3 i x y x 2 0 y j p 4 i p 3 i p 2 i 0 j p 1 i 0 j 6 pi conv p 4 i p 4 i and p p 1 p 2 p 2 q 1 p 1 i 0 j p 2 i 0 j p 3 i o figure 2 clearly all pi are centrally symmetric convex lattice polygons as shown by figure 2 and by 11 12 and their constructions v pi m 2 pi p let pi denote the maximal cardinality of the sets of collinear lattice points in pi it follows by the constructions of pi that pi 2 j 2 1 and the lattice segment from 0 j 2 to 0 j 2 is the only longest one passing the origin thus any pair of the polygons in p are not equivalent and hence v 2 m p 2 q 1 13 on the other hand by the maximum assumption on in 10 and 9 we have m 4 v 2 m 1 2 2 1 5 1 2 1 6 14 thus by 13 8 and 14 we get log v 2 m q 2 m 1 3 this concludes the proof of the theorem 7 remark 2 ba ra ny 4 proposed the following problem decide whether lim m m 1 3 log v 2 m exists or not and determine the limit if it exists of course one can ask the same question for v 2 m let f d m denote the family of all d dimensional convex lattice polytopes of vol ume m d the family is divided by the relation into v d m classes by choosing one from each class we get a representative set for f d m to determine a repre sentative set for f d m is an interesting problem as well for this purpose we will introduce some invariants in next sections in the plane when m is small based on lemma 1 and pick s theorem we can determine representative sets for f 2 m see appendix 1 and therefore the values of v 2 m the methodology will be introduced in section 4 m 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 v 2 m 1 2 3 7 6 13 11 4 convex lattice polygons of given cardinality in this section we study the classification problem for convex lattice polygons of given cardinality first we prove the following result which is an analogue to the results of arnold ba ra ny and pach theorem 2 when w is sufficiently large we have w 1 3 log 2 w w 1 3 proof if p w and v p m 2 hold for suitable positive integers w and m by pick s theorem we get w 2 m 2 w 2 then by 5 we have log 2 w log 2 w 2 m w 2 v 2 m log w 1 max w 2 m 2 w 2 v 2 2 w w 1 3 logw w 13 which proves the upper bound next we prove the lower bound by following arnold s process let be a large number let v denote the set of all primitive integer vectors in the semicircle x y x 2 y 2 2 x 0 and let m denote the convex lattice polygon whose oriented sides are all vectors in v and v v v see figure 3 8 v m o e 1 figure 3 from 8 we directly deduce v 3 2 o log 15 the convex lattice polygon m has following properties 1 it has v 1 vertices 2 let r be the largest radius of semicircular discs contained in m and let r be the smallest radius of semicircular discs containing m by 15 it can be easily deduced that 3 r r 3 16 3 each side except the diameter contains no other integral point except the ends the oriented edge at the top is e 1 see figure 3 4 the polygon m changes only when 2 passes through integral values and m 1 m c 1 17 holds for some constant c 1 this inequality can be deduced from property 2 we will now construct polygons pi that are assembled with the help of smaller polygons p 1 i and p 2 i for convenience we enumerate the short sides of 2 m by s 1 s 2 s v in the clockwise order it follows by property 3 that each of these sides say si has three integral points p 0 i p 1 i and p 2 i in the order then p 0 1 0 0 p 0 i p 2 i 1 and p 2 v 2 v v v for each vector u i 1 i 2 i v 1 1 2 v 1 we obtain a convex lattice polygon p 1 u conv p 01 p i 1 1 p i 2 2 p i v 1 v 1 p 2 v 9 and clearly the lattice polygons p 1 u p 1 v differ for distinct u v 1 2 v 1 so we obtain 2 v 1 convex lattice polygons we enumerate them by p 11 p 1 2 p 1 2 v 1 and denote the set of these polygons by p 1 it follows by property 3 that 1 2 p 1 i 2 m 1 p 1 i p 1 assume that w is an integer and is the largest number satisfying 2 m w 18 then we have p 1 i w p 1 i p 1 let n be an integer determined by 2 v v v n 0 there are nonnegative integers k and with n satisfying w p 1 i k n 1 then we define p 2 i x y 0 x n k y 1 y k 1 0 x 1 pi conv p 1 i p 2 i and define p to be the set of all these polygons pi clearly all pi are convex lattice polygons with pi w and for each pi there is at most another pj p satisfying pi pj therefore we get 2 w p 2 2 v 2 19 on the other hand by the maximum assumption on in 18 17 and 16 we have w 2 m 1 m 3 3 6 20 thus by 19 15 and 20 we get log 2 w v 2 w 1 3 the theorem is proved theorem 3 when w is odd and sufficiently large we have w 1 3 log 2 w w 13 10 remark 3 the upper bound of theorem 3 follows from theorem 2 and the fact that 2 w 2 w the lower bound can be proved by modifying the proof of theorem 1 simply replacing the areas by cardinalities in fact lemma 2 is no longer needed now similar to ba ra ny s problem the following one seems interesting and challenging as well problem 1 decide whether lim w w 1 3 log 2 w and lim w w 1 3 log 2 w exist or not determine the limits if they exist let g d w denote the family of all d dimensional convex lattice polytopes of car dinality w clearly the family is divided by the relation into d w classes by choosing one from each class we get a representative set for g d w to obtain a representative set for g 2 w as well as for f 2 m which was defined directly after remark 2 for a given positive integer w we follow the following steps step 1 let p denote the maximum number such that p has p collinear integer points let x denote the largest integer z satisfying z x and let x denote the smallest integer z satisfying x z according to lemma 1 we have p w p g 2 w let l p be such a maximal collinear set it is well known in geometry of numbers that there is a z 2 preserving affine transformation which transfers l p to p successive integer points on the x axis therefore without loss of generality we assume that l p 1 2 p 1 0 1 2 p 1 1 0 1 2 p 1 0 step 2 we further classify the convex lattice polygons according to the number of points above and below the x axis let p take the values w 1 w 2 w respectively for each value we get a list of partitions w p z 1 z 2 where z 1 and z 2 are nonnegative integers with z 1 z 2 let li p denote the set of p x y y i x z and let i p denote the cardinality of li p by a suitable z 2 preserving affine transformation we can take l 1 p 1 2 1 p 1 1 12 1 p 1 1 1 1 2 1 p 1 1 in particular 0 1 l 1 p for convenience we abbreviate p x y y 0 and p x y y 0 by p and p respectively 11 let h be the maximal integer that h p 6 0 f be the area of p i be the number of the interior lattice points of p and let j be the number of the lattice points on the boundary of p by pick s theorem we get h p 2 f j 2 i 2 2 j i 2 p z 1 and therefore h 2 z 1 p by convexity p z 2 is contained in the region bounded by four lines x y y 0 x y y x 1 2 p 1 x y y 2 z 1 p and x y y x 1 2 p 1 similarly the lower part p z 2 is contained in the region bounded by x y y 0 the line passing 0 1 and 1 2 p 1 1 0 x y y 2 z 2 p and the line passing 0 1 and 1 2 p 1 1 0 thus for each partition we can routinely get all possible convex lattice polygons in the sense of the equivalence with z 1 lattice points above l p and z 2 points below l p thus we get a set f which contains a representative set of g 2 w step 3 to determine two polygons are equivalent or not we need to define a set of invariants under as an example for a convex lattice polygon pi f we define an invariant vector vi v 1 i v 2 i v 3 i where v 1 i pi v 2 i is the number of vertices of pi and v 3 i is the number of the interior lattice points of pi clearly we have vi vj if pi pj therefore pi 6 pj if vi 6 vj when w is small a couple of nice invariants are enough to distinguish all non equivalent lattice polygons for large w it seems that a complicated set of invariants is required following these steps and applying the invariant vector introduced above we get representative sets for g 2 3 g 2 4 g 2 5 g 2 6 and g 2 7 as listed in ap pendix 2 consequently we get the exact values of 2 w for 3 w 7 up to now we have not employed a computer in this project it is possible to create a computer program based on these steps to determine g 2 w and 2 w for some large w w 3 4 5 6 7 2 w 1 3 6 13 21 5 convex lattice polytopes of given cardinality in this section we study d w and d w for d 3 let e 1 e 2 ed be an orthonormal base of ed we define p d w k to be the convex hull of o ei jed d 1 n 1 en ked i 1 2 d 1 j 1 w d 1 when d 3 and w d 1 it can be easily shown that p d w k is a d dimensional convex lattice polytope with p d w k w 21 12 for example figure 4 shows the three dimensional convex lattice polytope p 3 5 3 o e 1 e 2 e 3 e 1 e 2 3 e 3 p 3 5 3 figure 4 x 3 when k d 2 w d 1 the lattice polytope p d w k can be divided into two simplices p 1 conv o ei d 1 n 1 en ked i 1 2 d 1 and p 2 conv o ei jed i 1 2 d 1 j 1 w d 1 thus we get v p d w k k w d 1 d 22 it follows by 21 that all p d w k belong to g d w on the other hand it follows by 22 that p d w k 1 6 p d w k 2 whenever ki d 2 w d 1 for i 1 and 2 thus we have proved the following result theorem 4 when d 3 and w d 1 we have d w remark 4 comparing with 2 one can see the essential difference between v d m and d w when d 3 the first is finite the second is infinite let i p denote the number of the interior lattice points in p improving a result of lagarias and ziegler 16 o pikhurko in 2001 obtained a upper bound see 9 of 19 which implies that v p cd p 23 if i p 6 0 where cd is a constant depends only on d let d w denote the number of different classes of d dimensional convex lattice polytopes p with p w and i p 6 0 it follows by 23 and 2 that 13 log d w log cd w m 1 v d m log cd w max m 1 2 cd w v d m log cd w max m 1 2 cd w log v d m w d 1 d 1 in particular we have i p 6 0 if p is centrally symmetric thus we get log d w log d w as a conclusion we obtain the following result theorem 5 we have log d w w d 1 d 1 and log d w w d 1 d 1 remark 5 comparing with theorem 4 it shows the essential difference between d w and d w when d 3 acknowledgement we are grateful to professor
