november 19 2001 short version abstract george voronoi 1908 1909 introduced two important reduction methods for positive quadratic forms the reduction with perfect forms and the reduc tion with l type domains often called domains of delaunay type the first method is important in studies of dense lattice packings of spheres the sec ond method provides the key tools for finding the least dense lattice coverings with equal spheres in lower dimensions in his investigations voronoi heavily relied on that in dimensions less than 6 the partition of the cone of positive quadratic forms into l types refines the partition of this cone into perfect do mains voronoi conjectured implicitely and dickson 1972 explicitely that the l partition is always a refinement of the partition into perfect domains this was proved for n 5 voronoi delaunay ryshkov baranovskii we show that voronoi dickson conjecture fails already in dimension 6 keywords positive quadratic form perfect form point lattice

cone is the main object of study in our paper the interior of p n consists of positive definite forms of rank n we ab breviate positive definite forms as pdqfs pdqfs serve as algebraic representations of point lattices there is a one to one correspondence between isometry classes of n lattices and integral equivalence classes i e with respect to gl n z conjugation 1 http arxiv org abs math 0112097 v 1 of pdqfs in n indeterminates for basic results of the theory of lattices and pqfs and their applications see ryshkov and baranovskii 1978 gruber and lekkerkerker 1987 erdo s gruber and hammer 1989 conway and sloane 1999 gl n z acts pointwise on the space of quadratic forms sym n r rn a polyhedral reduction partition r of p n is a partition of this cone into open convex polyhedral cones such that definition 1 1 1 it is invariant with respect to gl n z 2 there are finitely many inequivalent cones in this partition 3 for each cone c of r and any pqf f in n indeterminates f can be gl n z equivalent to at most finitely many forms lying in c the partition into perfect cones and the l type partition also referred to as the voronoi partition of the 2 nd kind or the partition into voronoi reduction domains are important polyhedral reduction partitions of p n our usage of term domain is lax it should be clear from the context whether we mean the whole arithmetic class or just one element of this class these partitions have been intensively studied in geometry of numbers since times of korkin zolotareff 1873 and voronoi 1908 and more recently in combinatorics e g deza et al 1997 and algebraic geometry e g alexeev 1999 a b in most previous works e g voronoi 1908 1909 ryshkov baranovskii 1976 dickson 1972 the l type partition of p n or sub cones of p n was constructed by refining the perfect partition it is not an exaggeration to say that in almost any systematic study except for engels computational investigations l types were approached via perfect forms for example voronoi started classifying 4 dimensional l types by analyzing the delaunay l tilings of forms lying in the 1 st an and 2 nd dn perfect domains the same route was followed by ryshkov and baranovskii 1976 it was wideley believed that the l type parition is the refinement of the perfect parition i e each convex cone of the perfect partition is the union of finitely many conex cones from the l type partition this conjecture is implicit in voronoi s memoirs 1908 1909 and explicit in dickson 1972 where he showed that the first perfect domain is the only perfect domain which coincided with an l type domain in our paper we present the results of our study of the relashionship between these two partitions for n 6 we have proved that for n 6 the l type partition is not a refinement of the partition into perfect cones as was believed before this note contains only a scketch of the proof of this result which will be later published in a longer journal paper about 35 40 pp 2 perfect and l type partitions 2 2 1 l types definition 2 1 let l be a lattice in rn a convex polyhedron p in rn is called a delaunay cell of l with respect to a positive quadratic form f x x if 1 for each face f of p we have conv l f f 2 there is a quadric circumscribed about p called the empty ellipsoid of p when f x x is positive definite whose quadratic form is f x x in case rank f n this quadric is an elliptic cilinder 3 no points of l lie inside the quadric circumscribed about p when f n i 1 x 2 i our definition coincides with the classical definition of delau nay cell in en delaunay cells form a convex face to face tiling of l that is uniquely defined by l delaunay 1937 two delaunay cells are called homologous is they can be mapped to each other with a composition of a lattice translation and a central inversion with respect to a lattice point definition 2 2 pqfs f 1 and f 2 belong to the same convex l domain if the delaunay tilings of zn with respect to f 1 and f 2 are identical f 1 and f 2 belong to the same l type if these tilings are equivalent with respect to gl n z the folowing proposition establishes the equivalence between the delaunay s def inition of l equivalence for lattices and the notion of l equivalence for arbitrary pqfs which is introduced above proposition 2 3 positive definite forms f and g belong to the same l type if the corresponding lattices belong to the same l type with respect to the form n i 1 x 2 i theorem 2 4 voronoi the parition of p n into l types is a reduction partition moreover it is face to face the notions of delauny tiling and l type are important in the study of extremal and group theoretic properties of lattices for example the analysis of delaunay cells in the leech lattice conducted by conway sloane e g see 1999 and borcherds showed that 23 deep holes delaunay cells of radius equal to the covering radius of the lattice in the leech lattice correspond to 23 even unimodular 24 dimensional lattices niemeier s list that in turn give rise to 23 gluing constructions of the leech lattice from root lattices barnes and dickson 1967 1968 and later in a geometric form delaunay et al 1969 1970 proved the following theorem 2 5 the closure of any n dimensional convex l domain contains at most one local minimum of the sphere covering density the group of gl n z automorphisms of the domain maps this form to itself 3 using this approach delaunay ryshkov and baranovskii 1963 1976 found the best lattice coverings in e 4 and e 5 the theory of l types also has numerous connec tions to combinatorics and in particular to cuts hypermetrics and regular graphs see deza et al 1997 recently v alexeev 1999 a b found exciting connections between compactifications of moduli spaces of principally polirized abelian varities and l types 2 2 perfect cones the l type partition of p n is closely related to the theory of perfect forms orig inated by korkine and zolotareff 1873 let f x x be a pdqf the arithmetic minimum of f x x is the minimum of this form on zn the integral vectors on which this minimum is attained are called the representations of the minimum or the minimal vectors of f x x these vectors have the minimal length among all vectors of zn when f x x is used as the metrical form form f x x is called perfect if it can be reconstructed up to scale from all representations of its arithmetic mini mum in other words a form f x x with the arithmetic minimum m and the set of minimal vectors vk k 1 2 s is perfect if the system n i j 1 aijv i kv j k m where k 1 2 s has a unique solution aij in sym n r r n indeed uniquness requires at least n n 1 minimal vectors definition 2 6 pqfs f 1 and f 2 belong to the same cone of the perfect partition if they both can be written as strictly positive linear combinations of some subset of minimal vectors of a perfect form f 1 and f 2 belong to the same perfect type if there is f 1 equivalent to f 1 such that f 1 and f 2 belong to the same cone of the perfect partition theorem 2 7 voronoi the partition of p n into perfect domains is a reduction partition moreover it is face to face each 1 dimensional cone of this partition lies on p n perfect forms play an important role in lattice sphere packings voronoi s theorem 1908 says that if a form is extreme i e a maximum of the packing density it must also be perfect see coxeter 1951 conway sloane 1988 for the proof the notion of eutactic form arises in the study of the dense lattice sphere packings and is directly related to the notion of perfect form the reciprocal of f x x is a form whose gramm matrix is the inverse of the gramm matrix of f x x the dual form is normally denoted by f x x a form f x x is called eutactic if the dual form f x x can be written as s k 1 k vk x 2 where vk k 1 s is the set of mutually non collinear minimal vectors of f x x and k 0 theorem 2 8 voronoi a form f x x is a maximum of the sphere packing density if and only if f x x is perfect and eutactic 4 voronoi gave an algorithm finding all perfect domains for given n this algorithm is known as voronoi s reduction with perfect forms for the computational analysis of his algorithm and its improvements see martinet 1996 the perfect forms and the incidence graphs of perfect paritions of p n have have been completely described for n 7 2 3 the relashionship in low dimensions the case of n 6 voronoi 1908 09 proved that for n 2 3 the l partition and the perfect partition of p n coincide the perfect facet d 4 the 2 nd perfect form in 4 variables exemplifies a new pattern in the relation of these partitions namely the facet d 4 is decomposed into a number of simplicial l type domains like a pie this decomposition consists of the cones with apex at the affine center of this facet over the n 2 faces these simplexes are l type domains of two arithmetic types type i is adjacent to the the perfect l type domain of a 4 type ii is adacent to an arithmetically equivalent l type domain also type ii indeed from the l subdivision of the adjacent d 4 domain for details see delaunay et al 1963 1968 voronoi also proved that for n 4 the tiling of p n with l type domains refines the partition of this cone into perfect domains ryshkov and baranovskii 1975 proved the refinement hypothesis for n 5 in his paper of 1972 t j dickson proved that the perfect domain of an also called the first perfect form after korkine and zolotareff 1873 is the only perfect domain that is also an l type domain he was also first to explicitly mention the common believe in voronoi s refinement hypothesis 3 metrical forms for the lattices e 6 and e 6 consider the following symetric sets of vectors in z 6 p 1 3 2 5 2 2 14 1 0 14 p 2 2 1 2 1 3 4 1 1 0 13 4 1 02 13 10 0 1 04 5 2 15 p 3 0 0 1 1 0 2 6 1 0 12 02 6 here we use a short hand notation for families of vectors obtained from some n vector by all circular permutations of selected subsets of its components 1 mk stands for k consecutive m s 2 square brackets a 1 an are used to denote all vectors that can be obtained from vector a 1 an by circular permutations in strings of symbols that are separated by commas and bordered on the sides by semicolons and or brackets 3 numbers between semicolumns and or brackets are not permuted the two sets of perfect vectors pe 6 p 1 p 2 and pe 6 p 2 p 3 are the min imal vectors for the metrical forms e 6 and e 6 with arithmetic minimum m and 5 coefficient matrices pe 6 m 2 8 1 3 3 3 3 1 2 0 0 0 0 3 0 2 1 1 1 3 0 1 2 1 1 3 0 1 1 2 1 3 0 1 1 1 2 pe 6 m 4 16 5 5 5 5 5 5 4 1 1 1 1 5 1 4 1 1 1 5 1 1 4 1 1 5 1 1 1 4 1 5 1 1 1 1 4 the metrical forms e 6 and e 6 are integrally equivalent to forms 4 and 2 from barnes s table 1957 that e 6 and e 6 are forms for the root lattices e 6 and e 6 is established by the numbers of perfect vectors which are given by pe 6 54 and pe 6 72 the as shown below if this scale parameter is set equal to 8 3 then the geometric lattices corresponding to e 6 e 6 are dual lattices perfect vectors and perfect domains let v zd be centrally symmetric then define the domain of v to be given by v x v v v v x 2 v 0 as indicated by the superscript this summation is over an oriented subset of vectors one vector from each pair of opposites in the symmetric set v the domains pe 6 pe 6 are perfect cones of types e 6 and e 6 respectively they are defined on the perfect vectors for the perfect forms e 6 and e 6 proposition 3 1 pe 6 pe 6 is a facet of both pe 6 and pe 6 proof if forms have coefficient matrices p f define the scalar product trace pf consider the form e 6 e 6 and the rank one form p x p x 2 then e 6 e 6 p trace pe 6 pe 6 pp t pt pe 6 pe 6 p e 6 p e 6 p if p pe 6 then e 6 p e 6 p m e 6 p 0 with equality if and only if p pe 6 pe 6 if p pe 6 then e 6 p e 6 p e 6 p m 0 with equality if and only if p pe 6 pe 6 it follows that the hyperplane with equation e 6 e 6 0 separates pe 6 and pe 6 and that pe 6 pe 6 is a face of both these perfect domains that pe 6 pe 6 is a facet follows by showing that the linear span of the forms p x p x 2 p pe 6 pe 6 has co dimension one in the linear space of metrical forms we omit this argument eutactic forms the forms e 6 x m 12 p p e 6 p x 2 e 6 x m 16 p p e 6 p x 2 6 lie on the central rays of the perfect cones e 6 e 6 and have coefficient matrices given by fe 6 m 2 8 5 5 5 5 5 5 4 3 3 3 3 5 3 4 3 3 3 5 3 3 4 3 3 5 3 3 3 4 3 5 3 3

given by u 2 2 0 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 u 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 being arithmetically equivalent e 6 e 6 are alternate metrical forms for the same geometric lattice and similarly for e 6 e 6 we will refer to the minimal vectors of these forms as short the short vectors for e 6 and e 6 are related to the perfect vectors for e 6 and e 6 by the formulas se 6 s 2 s 3 se 6 s 1 s 2 where s 1 u 1 p 1 s 2 u 1 p 2 s 3 u 1 p 3 explicit form for the sets s 1 s 2 s 3 can be obtained by a direct calculation s 1 2 1 1 4 2 0 14 0 1 04 s 2 0 1 1 0 3 4 2 0 0 13 4 1 12 03 10 1 1 04 5 3 15 s 3 0 0 1 1 0 2 6 2 1 12 02 6 the four coefficient matrices satisfy the relations fe 6 pe 6 fe 6 pe 6 3 8 m 2 i so that when m 8 3 fe 6 pe 6 1 fe 6 pe 6 1 under these circumstances the pair of forms e 6 e 6 and the pair e 6 e 6 are in duality e 6 e 6 e 6 e 6 e 6 e 6 e 6 e 6 dual forms correspond to dual lattices so the single geometric lattice corresponding to the forms e 6 e 6 is dual to the geometric lattice corresponding to e 6 e 6 this pair of geometric lattices is the pair of root lattices e 6 and e 6 the above representations for e 6 e 6 can equally well be considered as repre sentations for the dual forms e 6 e 6 e 6 e 6 which shows that e 6 e 6 lie interior to the domains e 6 e 6 determined respectively by e 6 e 6 since 7 e 6 e 6 e 6 e 6 the original forms have eutaxy see section 2 representations identicle to those for e 6 e 6 e 6 x m 12 s s e 6 s x 2 e 6 x m 16 s s e 6 s x 2 the summation again is over an oriented subset of minimal vectors for the reciprocal forms respectively the forms e 6 e 6 the symmetrical arrangement provided by the domains e 6 e 6 is remarkable it is a rare occurance that forms on the central rays of adjacent domains correspond to dual geometric lattices while the lattices are dual the forms e 6 e 6 are not these forms fit into the following intricate pattern e 6 is dual to e 6 which in turn is arithmetically equivalent to e 6 and e 6 is dual to e 6 which in turn is arithmetically equivalent to e 6 this pattern is known since the times of korkine and zolotareff 1873 see also coxeter 1951 barnes 1957 showed that there is only one arithmetic type of wall between e 6 and e 6 3 0 1 the invariance groups for the forms e 6 and e 6 the point group for the root lattice e 6 is the product of the two element group generated by central inversion and the reflection group e 6 and has order 2 8345 there is a representation ge 6 gl 6 z that is the invariance group of the perfect form e 6 with the following characterization g ge 6 if and only if e 6 gx e 6 x there is a second representation ge 6 that is the invariance group of the form e 6 the dual group representation g e 6 is the invariance group of the perfect form e 6 and the dual group representation g e 6 is the invariance group of the form e 6 the subgroup g e 6 is defined by g e 6 g 1 t g ge 6 where g g 1 t is the matrix for the dual transformation there is a similar defini tion for the subgroup g e 6 from the arithmetic equivalences pe 6 u se 6 and pe 6 u se 6 it follows that g e 6 u ge 6 u 1 and g e 6 u ge 6 u 1 where u gl 6 z was described above proposition 3 2 the subgroups ge 6 ge 6 g e 6 g e 6 gl 6 z are the full invari ance groups of the respective sets of vectors se 6 se 6 pe 6 pe 6 and act transitively on these sets the remaining sections will be devoted to the proof of the main theorem that provides for a counterexample to the refinement hypothesis theorem 3 3 main the segment t e 6 1 t e 6 0 t 1 has forms of 5 l types t 0 0 t 1 2 t 1 2 1 2 t 1 t 1 the wall between the perfect domains pe 6 and pe 6 crosses this segment at point 2 5 e 6 3 5 e 6 8 4 l types 4 1 commensurate delaunay tilings a convex polyhedron p in rn is called a zn polyhedron if any face f of p is conv aff f zn a zn tiling is a face to face tiling of rn by convex zn polyhedra if t 1 t 2 are two convex tilings of r n one can define the intersection tiling of t 1 and t 2 the open tiles of this tiling are all non empty intersections of open tiles of t 1 and t 2 the intersection tiling of two z n tilings is not always a zn tiling it is a z n tiling if and only if the vertex set of the intersection tiling is zn definition 4 1 let p 1 and p 2 be two z n polyhedra they are called commensurate if all the faces of p 1 p 2 are z n polyhedra in particular two zn polytopes p 1 and p 2 are commensurate if the vertex set of p 1 p 2 belongs to z n definition 4 2 let t 1 t 2 be two z n tilings they are called commensurate if their intersection tiling consist of zn polyhedra only in particular the vertex set of the intersection tiling of t 1 and t 2 must be a subset of zn possibly empty lemma 4 3 assume that lattice tilings d 1 d 2 of z n are delaunay with respect to the pqfs 1 and 2 also assume that c 1 c 2 are closed delaunay cells for d 1 and d 2 if c 1 c 2 z d 6 then c conv c 1 c 2 z d is a closed delaunay cell for all intermediate forms t 1 t 1 t 2 where 0 t 1 proof since c 1 is delaunay there is a scalars c 1 and vector p 1 so that f 1 x c 1 p 1 x 1 x is zero valued on the vertices of c 1 but has positive values on all other elements of zd therefore the equation f 1 x 0 is for an empty ellipsoid circumscribing c 1 there is a similar function for c 2 so that f 2 x c 2 p 2 x 2 x 0 is the equation of an empty ellipsoid circumscribing c 2 for 0 t 1 the function ft x 1 t f 1 x tf 2 x is zero valued on the vertices of c and positive on all other elements of zd therefore c is circumscribed by the empty ellipsoid with equation ft x 0 and is delaunay with respect to the form t 1 t 1 t 2 lemma 4 4 if delaunay tilings d f and d g of zn with respect to pqfs f and g are commensurate then their intersection zn tiling is delaunay with respect to f g for any 0 conversly if for all 0 t 1 the delaunay tiling of zn with respect to tf 1 t g is the same then delaunay tilings d f and d g of zn are commensurate 9 proof sinced f andd g are commensurate any cell c of the intersection tiling of d f and d g can be written as c conv c 1 c 2 z d where c 1 c 2 are closed delaunay cells for d 1 and d 2 by the above lemma c is delaunay for f g for any 0 if c is a delaunay cell with respect to tf 1 t g then by a standard continuity argument there are zn polyhedra cf cg which are delaunay relative to f and g respectively such that c cf and c cg therefore c cf cg conv cf cg z d thus all cells of the delaunay tiling defined by tf 1 t g are the intersections of the delaunay cells of d f and d g this implies that d f and d g are commensurate the following proposition directly follows from lemma 4 4 proposition 4 5 two forms f and g belong to the same l cone not type if and only if their delaunay tilings d f and d g are commensurate 5 g topes and g topes in this section we consider the delaunay tilings for z 6 relative to the forms e 6 and e 6 more specifically we study the delaunay tilings of forms lying on the segment joining e 6 and e 6 of p n these are affinely equivalent to the delaunay tilings for the root lattice e 6 and the dual lattice e 6 two delaunay cells are said to belong to the same homology class if one of them can be obtained from the other by the composition of a lattice translation and inversions our discussion is mostly descriptive and adapted specifically for studying the change of l type along the segment joining forms e 6 and e 6 more information about these tilings can be found in coxeter 1995 and baranovski 1991

common centroid cg 1 3 2 15 in these triples of points admissible positions of non zero components can be determined from that the affine centroid is always at cg 1 3 2 15 the convex hull is a polytope with 27 vertices the gosset polytope g usually denoted by 221 which we call the reference g tope there are 54 homologous copies of g that fit together facet to facet around the origin to form the star at the origin this arrangement can be extended to a tiling by g topes which is the delaunay tiling de 6 for z 6 determined by e 6 e g baranovskii 1991 10 these 45 triangles inscribed in g are le 6 triangles because the edge vectors e 1 g 2 1 1 4 2 0 14 0 1 04 5 e 2 g 4 2 1 4 1 2 04 3 0 14 5 e 3 g 0 0 1 2 12 1 1 02 12 1 1 12 02 15 e 4 g 2 1 2 0 3 3 0 2 13 1 1 0 13 20 are subsets of le 6 this is the set of 270 long vectors for e 6 and is defined by le 6 z z 6 e 6 z 2 m 2 m is the second minimum for e 6 which is the minimal value assumed on the non zero elements of z 6 not belonging to se 6 as is indicated by the notation these inscribed triangles belong to foura 5 classes of size 5 5 15 and 20 where a 5 is the subgroup of permutations of the last five coordinates each long vector appears only once in the list so the 45 edge sets account for the 270 45 6 long vectors for e 6 the group ge 6 has the following useful characterization ge 6 gl 6 z is the stability group of the set of short vectors se 6 the following theorem gives informa tion on ge 6 see e g coxeter 1995 or baranovskii 1991 theorem 5 1 coxeter the group ge 6 acts transitively on the 72 elements of se 6 the 270 elements of le 6 and the 54 g topes in the star at the origin 5 0 1 the inscribed long triangles the triangle 1 g has a vertex at the origin and is inscribed in g there are five such le 6 triangles that belong to a single a 5 class and together have ten vertices at distance 2 m from the origin these vertices which are given by r 1 r 2 r 5 0 1 04 5 b 1 b 2 b 5 2 0 1 4 5 are the vertices of a five dimensional cross polytope the five diagonals intersect at 1 2 2 15 and the ten diagonal vectors are given by l 1 b 1 r 1 b 2 r 2 b 5 r 5 2 1 1 4 5 and belong to a single parity class if g ge 6 g which is the stability group for g then g must fix the center 1 2 2 15 and therefore belong to the stability group of the cross polytope the group of linear transformations that map the cross polytope onto itself has order 25 5 and can be written as the product i 5 a 5 the subgroup i 5 inverts arbitrary numbers of axes and a 5 permutes the red vertices r 1 r 2 r 5 by per muting the last five co

calculation shows this transformation leaves se 6 invariant so i 12 ge 6 g similarly there are matrices i 13 i 14 i 15 ge 6 g that induce inversions of the pairs of axes indicated by the subscripts and together these four inversions generate the subgroup i 5 an arbitrary element i i 5 inverts an even number of axes of the cross polytope proposition 5 2 ge 6 g i 5 a 5 where the a 5 action permutes the last four co ordinates ge 6 1 g 2 4 4 proof this follows immediately from the preceeding discussion corollary 5 3 ge 6 acts transitively on the 54 g topes in the star of g topes at the

g topes have cross polytopes that are translates in particular the cross polytopes for g and g are homologous consequently there are 27 sets of diagonal vectors each with 10 long vectors belonging to the same parity class these sets of are given by l 1 2 1 1 4 5 1 l 4 1 2 0 4 5 1 l 2 2 0 1 4 4 2 14 0 0 12 12 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 12 1 5 l 3 0 1 0 4 2 1 2 03 2 1 0 2 02 2 1 02 2 0 2 1 03 2 5 l 5 3 0 1 4 1 0 1 13 1 0 1 1 12 1 0 12 1 1 1 0 13 1 5 l 6 3 2 0 1 3 3 0 2 13 1 02 1 12 1 02 1 1 1 1 02 12 1 10 12 these parity classes are grouped into six a 5 classes as indicated by the notation this gives a second accounting for the 270 elements of le 6 in geometric terms more directly related to our main line of argument are the following results on 1 g g corollary 5 4 ge 6 1 g i 5 a 4 where a 4 is permuation of the last four coor dinates proof this statement follows from the geometric description of 1 g above and the observation that ge 6 1 g ge 6 g corollary 5 5 there are 270 le 6 triangles ge 6 equivalent to 1 g which are in scribed in g topes in the star at the origin proof it follows from the equality ge 6 ge 6 1 g ge 6 i 5 a 4 2 8345 244 270 that there are 270 le 6 triangles ge 6 equivalent to 1 g that these are inscribed in g topes in the star follows from corollary 5 3 tiling with g topes the three le 6 triangles 1 t conv 0 6 04 1 0 05 1 2 t conv 2 0 1 4 1 02 1 02 1 0 1 03 3 t conv 0 1 0 4 1 03 12 12 04 have a common centroid ct 1 3 04 12 and belong to complementary 2 spaces their convex hull is a lattice polytope with nine vertices which we denote by g this reference g tope is a tile in the delaunay tiling de 6 determined by e 6 all others are isometrically equivalent to g relative to e 6 in total there are 40 homology classes of g topes accounting for 720 2 9 40 g topes in the star at the origin these inscribed triangles are le 6 triangles because the edge vectors e 1 t 0 4 1 1 05 1 04 1 0 e 2 t 0 2 1 1 02 3 0 2 13 3 0 1 2 12 e 3 t 2 1 0 2 12 1 2 04 1 1 02 12 belong to le 6 the set of 72 long vectors for e 6 the long vectors for e 6 are defined by le 6 z z 6 e 6 z 3 2 m where 3 2 m is the second minimum for e 6 there is a second representation ge 6 gl 6 z for the point group for e 6 which can be characterized as either the invariance group for the form e 6 or the stabilizer of se 6 the following theorem gives the essential information we will need on this action see e g baranovskii 1991 13 theorem 5 6 the group ge 6 acts transitively on the 54 elements of se 6 the 72 elements of le 6 and the 270 g topes in the star at the origin from the arithmetic equivalences pe 6 u se 6 and pe 6 u se 6 it follows that g e 6 u g e 6 u 1 and g e 6 u ge 6 u 1 where u gl 6 z was described above the dual groups g e 6 g g ge 6 and g e 6 g g ge 6 where g g 1 t is the matrix for the dual transformation the proof of following corollary will be included into the full length version of this paper corollary 5 7 there are 270 pe 6 triangles with a vertex at the origin these are g e 6 equivalent the se 6 triangle 4 t conv 0 0 5 0 1 04 2 0 14 is a 2 face of g and is equal to the le 6 triangle 1 g the edge set e 4 t e 1 g le 6 se 6 corollary 5 8 there are 720 se 6 triangles with a vertex at the origin these are 2 faces of g topes and are ge 6 equivalent proof this is an immediate consequence of the arithmetic equivalences se 6 u 1 pe 6 ge 6 u 1 ge 6 u and corollary 5 7 long triangles inscribed in g topes the 72 long vectors for e 6 are given by le 6 lb lc where lc s 3 and lb 3 0 1 4 1 2 04 02 1 03 2 1 0 13 1 1 0 13 3 0 2 13 1 1 12 02 the proof of the following lemma will be included into the full length exposition of our counterexample lemma 5 9 there are 120 homology classes of le 6 triangles proposition 5 10 the lattice polytope t is a g tope if and only if it is the convex hull of three le 6 triangles with a common centroid proof each g tope is the convex hull of three le 6 triangles with a common centroid since there are 40 homology classes of g topes there are 120 homology classes of le 6 triangles inscribed in g topes by lemma 5 9 this accounts for all the homology classes of le 6 triangles from which the proof of the proposition immediately follows 14 6 an embedded copy of d 4 since p 1 p 1 p 2 p 3 3 2 5 1 0 14 2 2 14 is the edge set for a pe 6 triangle this set spans a two dimensional subspace let d 4 be the four dimensional sublattice defined by z 6 p 1 and let d 4 be the restriction of e 6 to d 4 the minimal vectors for d 4 are given by sd 4 se 6 p 1 s 3 these minimal vectors determine d 4 and sd 4 24 this is sufficient to identify d 4 is a metrical form for the root lattice d 4 the set of long vectors for d 4 is given by ld 4 le 6 p 1 l 1 p 1 l 2 p 1 l 3 p 1 which is the union of three parity classes of eight vectors each these classes are the diagonal vectors for three orientations of cross polytopes which tile d 4 by translates this is the delaunay tiling dd 4 of d 4 relative to the form d 4 this delaunay tiling can also be realized as the four dimensional section de 6 p 1 the group gd 4 let gd 4 ge 6 ge 6 since by proposition 3 2 ge 6 is the stabilizer of se 6 s 2 s 3 and ge 6 is the stabilizer of se 6 s 1 s 2 gd 4 can be characterized as the subgroup of gl 6 z that stabilizes each of the sets s 1 s 2 s 3 the short and long vectors for d 4 relate to the sets s 1 and s 3 in the following way sd 4 s 3 l 1 l 2 l 3 s 1 ld 4 where the last union is disjoint the set s 1 l 1 l 2 l 3 2 1 1 4 0 1 04 2 0 14 is the edge set e 1 g for the triangle 1 g which is inscribed in g the proof of the following proposition will be included in to a full length paper proposition 6 1 gd 4 ge 6 e 1 g ge 6 e 1 g there are six le 6 trianges with a vertex at the origin and with edge set e 1 g these fit around the origin edge to edge to form a hexagon the triangle 1 g is one of the tiles in this hexagon and the other five are triangles homologous to it since ge 6 1 g ge 6 e 1 g gd 4 it follows from proposition 5 2 and corollary 5 3 that gd 4 ge 6 e 1 g 6 ge 6 1 g 2 832 however the point group for the lattice d 4 has order 2 732 which is less than gd 4 by a factor of two this discrepancy is explained by the following corollary corollary 6 2 the restriction of gd 4 to d 4 is a representation of the point group for the root lattice d 4 15 proof since the point group for d 4 is the only lattice point group for a four dimensional lattice of order 2732 we need only show the kernel of the restriction map is a two element group the kernal k gd 4 is the subgroup that fixes each point in d 4 the four diagonals b 2 r 2 b 5 r 5 of the cross polytope in the long layer of g form a basis for p 1 and therefore an arbitrary element k k must fix these diagonals it follows that k must then fix the parity class l 1 these two conditions can hold only if k maps b 1 r 1 to b 1 r 1 by the geometric discussion of the group ge 6 1 g it follows that k e i 0 i 5 gd 4 where i 0 is central inversion and e is the identity let k k 1 k 2 where k 1 e i 0 k 2 i 5 if k 1 e then k 2 must also equal e and k e if k 1 i 0 then k 2 must invert the four diagonals b 2 r 2 b 5 r 5 which uniquely determines the element k 2 one of the ways to write k 2 in this case is as the product i 23 i 34 where i 23 inverts the second and third axes of the cross polytope and i 45 inverts the fourth and fifth therefore when k 1 i 0 k k 0 i 0 i 23 i 34 and the matrix for k 0 is given by sd 4 k 0 3 0 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 it follows that k e k 0 and is a two element group the faces of dd 4 the origin 0 d 4 and the star of delaunay tiles at the origin has 24 cross polytopes eight belonging to each orientation the lower dimensional cells are sd 4 simplexes corollary 6 3 for the tiling dd 4 the star of dd 4 cells at the origin contains 24 edges 96 triangles 96 3 simplexes and 24 cross polytopes for each dimension the cells in the star are gd 4 equivalent proof by corollary 6 2 the homorphic image of gd 4 on d 4 is a group of order 2732 which acts effectively on d 4 and is a representation of the point group for the lattice d 4 the order of the full linear invariance group of a cross polytope attached to the origin in r 4 is 23 3 since 2732 24 23 3 the stability group for each of the 24 cross polytopes in the star has order 23 3 and the gd 4 orbit of each includes all 24 cross polytopes since the stability group in gd 4 of any particular cross polytope in the star is the full invariance group all edges all 2 faces and 3 faces of the cross polytope which are attached to the origin are gd 4 equivalent the number of edges attached to the origin is eqaul to the number of short vectors which is 24 each cross polytope has 12 2 cells attached to the origin and each 16 2 cell belongs to 3 cross polytopes in the star therefore there are 24 12 3 96 2 cells attached to the origin each cross polytope has 8 facets attached to the origin and each belongs to a pair of cross polytopes therefore there are 24 8 2 96 3 cells attached to the origin equivalent facets of pe 6 and pe 6 since g e 6 g e 6 gl 6 z are the full invariance groups of the corresponding sets of perfect vectors pe 6 and pe 6 pe 6 is invariant with respect to the action of ge 6 and pe 6 is invariant with respect to the action of ge 6 the proof of the following corollary will be included in to a full length paper corollary 6 4 the perfect domain pe 6 has 45 facets that are ge 6 equivalent to pe 6 pe 6 and the perfect domain pe 6 has 45 facets that are ge 6 equivalent to pe 6 pe 6 the 45 ge 6 equivalent facets of pe 6 described in this corollary are in one to one correspondence with the 45 possible edge sets for le 6 triangles inscribed in g topes and the 45 ge 6 equivalent facets of pe 6 are in one to one correspondence with the 45 possible edge sets for se 6 triangles which are 2 faces of g topes 7 commensurate and incommensurate g topes a g tope homologous to the reference g tope is called a t tope since t g this g tope is commensurate with g and therefore commensurate with the delaunay tiling de 6 we will count g topes below and discover that there are 24 homology classes of such commensurate g tope there is a second incommensurate class of g tope with representative q which is the convex hull of the three le 6 triangles 1 q conv 0 3 1 02 04 1 0 05 1 2 q conv 0 1 0 4 12 04 1 02 13 3 q conv 2 0 1 4 1 05 1 0 1 03 with common centroid cq 1 3 03 13 in the counting exercise below we will find there are 16 homology classes of incommensurate g topes and will refer g topes in any of these classes as a q topes there are only two homology classes of g tope so the 24 commensurate classes and the 16 incommensurate classes sum to the required number of 40 homology classes of g tope the commensurate and incommensurate classes and the 24 commensurate classes there are sixteen homology classes of such g topes and we will refer to these as q topes an application of proposition 5 10 shows that q is a g tope that q is incom mensurate with g is established by considering the the simplicial 3 faces sq q and sg g the simplex sq conv 0 1 0 4 2 0 14 12 04 1 05 q is the 17 convex hull of an edge from each of the triangles 2 q 3 q so is a 3 face ofq the cen troid 1 4 02 14 is also the centroid of the simplex sg conv 0 2 1 03 03 1 02 04 1 0 05 1 which is a 3 face of g these simplexes lie in complementary 3 spaces so satisfy the condition that st sg 1 4 02 14 the relatively open cells of the intesection polytope q g are the intersections of relatively open cells of q and g for this reason the common centroid is a vertex of q g and since it is non integral q is incommensurate with g therefore q is incommensurate with the delaunay tiling de 6 another important class lattice polytope is the class of r topes the lattice poly tope r conv sq sg serves as an example this r tope has full dimension and eight vertices so can be triangulated in just two ways by taking the convex hull of sq with each 2 face of sg the four blue simplexes b 1 b 2 b 3 b 4 are formed this collection is the star of simplexes in r with the 3 face sq these blue simplexes tile r the four yellow simplexes y 1 y 2 y 3 y 4 form a second star each yellow simplex being the convex hull of sg with one of the four 2 faces of sq this is the collection of simplexes in r with the 3 face sg the yellow simplexes also tile r lattice polytopes such as r are refered to as repartitioning complexes in the literature on lattice delaunay tilings in the counting exercise below we will see that there are 12 homology classes of r topes stars of g topes in order to effectively study the geometry of q topes and r topes we must first obtain information on the relationship between the perfect vectors pe 6 and the g topes in the star of g topes at the origin if v g is the vertex set for g then relative to e 6 the set vertices of g that are a distance m from the origin are given by se 6 g v c se 6 and the set vertices that are a distance 2 m are given by le 6 c v c le 6 these short and long layers of vertices can also be characterized in terms of the perfect vector p 1 3 2 5 using the incidence relations for g topes se 6 g s se 6 p 1 s 1 le 6 g l le 6 p 1 l 2 the perfect vector p 1 determines the short and long layers of vertices which in turn determine g so we write g gp 1 this process can be reversed and the incidence relations can be used to determine the perfect vector associated with g p 1 pg p pe 6 p s 1 s se 6 g p pe 6 p l 2 l le 6 g for this case the set pg contains the single elements p 1 by proposition 3 2 the incidence relations can be used to establish a one to one correspondence between the g topes in the star at the origin and the vectors of pe 6 if p pe 6 then gp is the corresponding g tope in the star and if g is in the star then pg is the corresponding perfect vector this association can be extended to 18 cover arbitrary cells c de 6 with a vertex at the origin if se 6 c v c se 6 and le 6 c v c le 6 are the short and long layers for c define pc p pe 6 p s 1 s se 6 c p pe 6 p l 2 l le 6 c when dim c 6 the set pc includes several perfect vectors the short and long layers and therefore c can be recoverd from pc by again invoking the incidence relations se 6 c s se 6 p s 1 p pc le 6 g l le 6 p l 2 p pc for a cell c de 6 starg c is the collection of g topes with face c the following proposition gives information on g stars when c has a vertex at the origin proposition 7 1 if 0 c starg c gp p pc proof this assertion follows from the discussion on incidence relations the geometry of r topes in the statement of the following lemma starg sg is the collection of g topes which have the face sg and starg sq is the collection of g topes which have the face sq the proof of the following lemma will be included into the full length paper lemma 7 2 starg sq q 1 q 4 where q 1 q 4 are q topes q 1 q and the blue simplexes can be ordered so that bi qi r i 1 4 similarly starg sg g 1 g 4 where g 1 g 4 are g topes g 1 g and the yellow sim plexes can be ordered so that y i gi r i 1 4 proposition 7 3 r is commensurate with both de 6 and de 6 proof by lemma 7 2 the intersection r de 6 is tiled by the blue lattice simplexes so r is commensurate with de 6 similarly the intersection r de 6 is tiled by the yellow lattice simplexes so r is commensurate with de 6 the geometry of q topes the convex hull of 1 q with one edge from each of the other triangles 2 q 3 q q has seven vertices and is a lattice simplex in q two edges can be selected in nine ways so there are nine such simplexes each with 1 q as a 2 face this is the star of simplexes in q with the 2 face 1 q and this collection tiles q in this subsection we show how six of these simplexes are commensurate with both de 6 and de 6 we call them white the other three are blue and can be represented as the intersection of q with three distinct r topes there are two other collections of simplexes that tile q the star of simplexes in q with the 2 face 2 q and the star with the 2 face 3 q however both of these tilings play no role in our discussion the reason for this is that 1 q is a 2 cell in de 6 but the other two triangles 2 q 3 q are not the proof of the following lemma will be included into the full length paper 19 lemma 7 4 starg 1 q g 1 g 6 where g 1 g 6 are g topes and g 1 g moreover for i 1 6 w i conv gi q z 6 is a six dimensional lattice simplex with the property that 1 q w i we will refer to these simplexes as white lemma 7 5 there are three r topes r 1 r 2 r 3 such that r 1 r and such that bi ri q i 1 3 are six dimensional lattice simplexes with the 2 face 1 q since these simplexes are the intersections of r topes and a q tope they are blue proof the three simplexes s 1 q conv 0 1 0 4 2 0 14 12 04 1 05 s 2 q conv 0 1 0 4 2 0 14 1 02 13 1 0 1 03 s 3 q conv 1 2 04 1 05 1 02 13 1 0 1 03 are 3 faces of q and s 1 q sq each is the convex hull of an edge from 2 q and 3 q the three simplexes s 1 g conv 0 2 1 03 03 1 02 04 1 0 05 1 s 2 g conv 2 1 0 1 3 03 1 02 04 1 0 05 1 s 3 g conv 2 1 2 03 03 1 02 04 1 0 05 1 are sd 4 simplexes and s 1 g sg the three centroids of theq simplexes s 1 q s 2 q s 3 q are given by 1 4 02 14 1 4 2 1 0 23 1 4 2 12 13 and these coincide with the cen troids of the corresponding sd 4 simplexes s 1 g s 2 g s 3 g the three sd 4 simplexes are translates of closed 3 cells in dd 4 so by proposition 6 3 belong to gd 4 equivalent homology classes it follows that the three lattice polytopes r 1 conv s 1 q s 1 g r 2 conv s 2 q s 2 g r 3 conv s 3 q s 3 g belong to gd 4 equivalent homology classes since r 1 conv s 1 q s 1 g conv sq sg r these three lattice polytopes are r topes since by lemma 7 5 b 1 q r 1 q r is a six dimensional blue lattice simplex the intersections b 2 q r 2 b 3 q r 3 are other six dimensional blue lattice simplexes by construction 1 q b 1 b 2 b 3 lemma 7 6 the star of simplexes in q containing 1 q has six white simplexes w 1 w 2 w 6 and three blue simplexes b 1 b 2 b 3 the six white simplexes are commensurate with de 6 and de 6 and the three blue simplexes are commensurate with de 6 but incommensurate with de 6 proof the simplexes w 1 w 2 w 6 are those described in the statement of lemma 7 4 since w i gi q i 1 6 these white simplexes are commensurate with both de 6 and de 6 the simplexes b 1 b 2 b 3 are those described in the statement of lemma 7 5 since bi ri q the blue simplex bi is commensurate with de 6 the simplex siq is a 3 face of b i and the simplexe sig is a closed 3 cells in de 6 since the intersection siq s i g is the centroid of each of these cells s i q and s i g the simplex b i is incommensurate with de 6 20 t topes q topes and r topes the intersection properties of any g tope with respect to de 6 are invariant with respect to the gd 4 action therefore any g tope gd 4 equivalent to t is commensurate with de 6 and any g tope gd 4 equivalent to q is incommensurate with de 6 since commensurability is a property that extends to homology classes it is natural to make the following defi nitions a t tope is a lattice polytope gd 4 equivalent to one homologous to t and a q tope is a lattice polytope gd 4 equivalent to a lattice polytope homologous to q as a q tope it is also natural to refer to commensurate and incommensurate homology classes of g topes so that homology classes of t topes are commensurate classes and homology classes of q topes are incommensurate by the definitions of t tope and q tope the homology classes of t topes are gd 4 equivalent and the homology classes of q topes are gd 4 equivalent each of the triangles 1 t 2 t 3 t in t has two edges that are long relative to e 6 and a single edge that is short this is a property that is gd 4 invariant so each t tope has three inscribed triangles of this type on the other hand the triangle 1 q in q has edges that are short relative to e 6 and the triangles 2 q 3 q have edges that are long accordingly each q tope has one short and two long inscribed triangles the set of r topes is the other collection we must consider an r tope is a lattice polytope gd 4 equivalent to a lattice polytope homologous to r the homology classes of r topes are gd 4 equivalent and each r tope in any of these classes has identicle intersection properties if r is an arbitrary r tope then r de 6 has four yellow simplexes y 1 r y 2 r y 3 r y 4 r which belong to distinct g topes and fit around a 3 cell s g de 6 r de 6 has four blue simplexes b 1 r b 2 r b 3 r b 4 r which belong to distinct q topes and fit around a 3 cell s q de 6 each r tope r is commensurate with both de 6 and de 6 lemma 7 7 the 40 homology classes of g topes are divided between 24 homology classes of t topes and 16 homology classes of q topes there are 12 homology classes of r topes proof will be included into the full length paper repackaging q topes each q tope contains six white and three blue simplexes and since there are 16 homology classes of q topes there are 96 homology classes of white and 48 homology classes of blue simplexes the 12 homology classes of r topes gives a second accounting for blue simplexes since each r tope can be tiled by four blue simplexes this allows a repackaging of the blue simplexes contained in q topes into r topes the portion of space tiled by the 16 classes of q topes can equally well be tiled by the 96 homology classes of white simplexes and 12 classes of r topes this alternate tiling has the property that each tile is commensurate with both de 6 and de 6 21 proposition 7 8 the 24 homology classes of t topes the 12 homology classes of r topes and the 96 homology classes of white simplexes fit together facet to facet to tile space this lattice tiling dr is commensurate with both de 6 and de 6 proof since the t topes and q topes tile space the discussion immediately preceeding the proposition shows that the t topes r topes and white simplexes also tile space by lemmae 7 2 7 6 and proposition 7 3 this tiling is commensurate with both de 6 and de 6 8 proof of main theorem the forms e 6 pe 6 and e 6 pe 6 lie on the central axes of their domains and the line segment t 1 t e 6 t e 6 0 t 1 runs between them the arithmetic minimum along this segment is m at the end points the minimal vectors are respectively se 6 and se 6 but at intermediate points the minimal vectors are given by se 6 se 6 the form r suppose that the reference r is delaunay with respect to the metrical form then there is a scalar c and vector p so that fr x c p x x is non negative on z 6 and zero valued on just the vertices of r fr x 0 is the equation of an empty ellipsoid circumscribing r the vertex sets for the component simplexes sg sq of r are given by vg 0 2 1 03 03 1 02 04 1 0 05 1 vq 0 1 0 4 2 0 14 12 04 1 05 and have the property that v vg v v vq v 4 cr 0 2 14 since fr is zero on each vertex of r the metrical form must satisfy the condition 0 v vg fr v v vq fr v p v vg v v vq v v vg v v vq v v vg v v vq v trace prf r where f is the matrix for and pr v vg vvt v vq vvt 6 1 2 2 2 2 1 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 1 1 1 1 2 0 1 1 1 1 2 0 1 1 1 1 2 0 1 1 1 1 22 the final expression r is the scalar product of forms r and where r corresponds to pr if forms have coefficient matrices p f then the scalar product is defined to be trace pf the equation r 0 determines a hyperplane hr in the space of metrical forms lemma 8 1 the line segment t 1 t e 6 t e 6 0 t 1 pierces the hyperplane hr at the point tr where tr 1 2 there are twelve hyperplanes of the form hr where r is an r tope and the line segment t 1 t e 6 t e 6 0 t 1 pierces each of these at 1 2 which is common to all of them proof a direct calculation shows that r t r 1 t e 6 t e 6 1 t trace prfe 6 t trace prfe 6 1 t 1 2 m t 1 2 m 1 2 m mt therefore the line segment t 0 t 1 pierces hr when t tr 1 2 each r tope r corresponds to a form r which in turn determines a hyper plane hr with equation r 0 if r g 1 r where g gd 4 then the corresponding form is given by r x r g x and hr gx x hr g is the matrix dual to g on the other hand if r is homologous to r then r r and hr hr there are twelve such hyperplanes as there are twelve homology classes of r topes see lemma 7 7 the equality 1 2 gx 1 2 x which holds for all g gd 4 implies that the line segment t pierces all of them at the same point proposition 8 2 tiling dr is delaunay with respect to the form 1 2 proof recall that dr consists of 24 homology classes of t topes 96 homology classes of white simplexes and 12 homology classes of r topes proposition 7 8 each t tope t in dr is a delaunay cell of de 6 whose intersection with a g tope of de 6 is t each white simplex in dr is the intersection of a q tope delaunay cell of de 6 and a g tope delaunay cell of de 6 by lemma 4 3 all white simplexes and t topes are delaunay with respect to any intermediate form including 1 2 by lemma 8 1 and the preceeding discussion all homology classes of r topes are delaunay for 1 2 proof for 0 t 1 2 the delaunay tiling for each form t 1 t e 6 t e 6 is constant and obtained by replacing each r tope in dr by four yellow simplexes for 1 2 t 1 the delaunay tiling for each form t is also constant and obtained by replacing each r tope in dr by four blue simplexes 23 the facet pe 6 pe 6 consider the form p e 6 e 6 and the rank one form p x p x 2 then p p e 6 e 6 p trace pe 6 pe 6 pp t pt pe 6 pe 6 p e 6 p e 6 p if p pe 6 then p p e 6 p e 6 p m e 6 p 0 with equality if an only if p pe 6 pe 6 and if p pe 6 then p p e 6 p e 6 p e 6 p m 0 with equality if an only if p pe 6 pe 6 it follows that the hyperplane hp with equation p 0 separates pe 6 and pe 6 and contains the facet pe 6 pe 6 lemma 8 3 the line segment t 1 t e 6 t e 6 0 t 1 pierces the facet pe 6 pe 6 when t tp 2 5 moreover the point p tp lies on the central axis of pe 6 pe 6 proof a direct calculation shows that p t e 6 e 6 1 t e 6 t e 6 1 t trace ppfe 6 t trace ppfe 6 1 t 2 8 m 2 t 3 8 m 2 2 8 m 2 5 8 m 2 t where pp pe 6 pe 6 therefore the line segment t 0 t 1 pierces the hyperplane hp when t tp 2 5 the forms t are invariant with respect to the action of gd 4 ge 6 ge 6 since gd 4 acts transitively on pe 6 pe 6 which can easily be checked the only gd 4 invariant positive forms on hp must lie on the central axis of pe 6 pe 6 therefore the line segment t 0 t 1 pierces the hyperplane along the central axis of pe 6 pe 6 proof of theorem 3 3 by lemma 8 2 dr is the delaunay tiling for the mid point of the segment t 1 t e 6 t e 6 by proposition 7 8 dr is commensurate with both de 6 and de 6 therefore by lemma 4 4 the l type does not change be tween e 6 and 1 2 and between e 6 and 1 2 by the results of section 3 e 6 and e 6 are the centroids of two adjacent perfect domains and as shown in the above lemma the wall between them intersects the segment t at t 2 5 references 1 v alexeev complete moduli in the presence of semiabelian group action to appear in annals of mathematics 96 pp arxiv math ag
