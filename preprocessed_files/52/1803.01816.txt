tverberg theorems over discrete sets of points j a de loera t a hogan f meunier and n h mustafa abstract this paper discusses tverberg type theorems with coordinate con straints i e versions of these theorems where all points lie within a subset s rd and the intersection of convex hulls is required to have a non empty intersection with s we determine the m tverberg number when m 3 of any discrete subset s of r 2 a generalization of an unpublished result of j p doignon we also present improvements on the upper bounds for the tverberg numbers of z 3 and zj rk and an integer version of the well known positive fraction selection lemma of j pach introduction consider n points in rd and a positive integer m 2 if n m 1 d 1 1 the points can always be partitioned into m subsets whose convex hulls contain a common point this is the celebrated theorem of tverberg tve 66 which has been the topic of many generalizations and variations since it was first proved in 1966 bs 18 dlgmm 19 in this paper we focus on new versions of tverberg type theorems where some of the coordinates of the points are restricted to discrete subsets of a euclidean space the associated discrete tverberg numbers are much harder to compute than their classical real version counterparts see for instance the complexity discussion of onn 91 we begin our work remembering the following unpublished tverberg type result of doignon consider n points with coordinates in z 2 and a positive integer m 3 if n 4 m 3 then the points can be partitioned into m subsets whose convex hulls contain a common point in z 2 according to eckhoff eck 00 this result was stated by doignon in a conference a partition of points where the intersection of the convex hulls contains at least one lattice point is called an integer m tverberg partition and such a common point is an integer tverberg point for that partition regarding the case m 2 the integer 2 tverberg partitions are called integer radon partitions any config uration of at least six points in z 2 admits an integer radon partition this was proved by doignon in his phd thesis doi 75 and later discovered independently by onn onn 91 all these values for z 2 are optimal as shown by following examples the 5 point configuration 0 0 0 1 2 0 1 2 3 2 exhibited by onn in the cited paper has no radon partition to address the optimality when m 3 con sider the set i i i i 1 i m 2 m 3 m 2 m 1 according to eckhoff eck 00 this set was proposed by doignon during the aforementioned 2010 mathematics subject classification primary 52 a 35 52 c 05 52 c 07 1 ar x iv 1 80 3 01 81 6 v 2 m at h m g 2 9 ja n 20 19 2 j a de loera t a hogan f meunier and n h mustafa conference this set has 4 m 4 points and a moment of reflection might convince the reader that it has no integer m tverberg partition more generally one can define the tverberg number tv s m for any subset s of rd and an integer m 2 as the smallest positive integer n with the following property any multiset of n points in s admits a partition into m subsets a 1 a 2 am with m i 1 conv ai s 6 here by partition of a multiset we mean that each element of a multiset a is contained in a number of submultisets a 1 am so that the sum of its multiplic ities in the ai is equal to its multiplicity in a if no such number exists we say that tv s m note that doignon s theorem together with the discussion that follows allows us to say tv z 2 m 6 if m 2 4 m 3 otherwise our contributions our first main result generalizes doignon s theorem we determine the exact m tverberg number when m is at least three for any discrete subset s of r 2 as considered in dlhrs 17 before stating this result we recall the helly number h s of a discrete subset s of rd as the smallest positive integer with the following property suppose f is a finite family of convex sets in rd and that g intersects s in at least one point for every subfamily g of f having at most h s members then f intersects s in at least one point if no such integer exists we say that h s then we have the following theorem the theorem is stated for s with finite helly number as any s rd with h s has tv s m for all m 2 lev 51 theorem 1 suppose s is a discrete subset of r 2 with h s if m 3 then tv s m h s m 1 1 regarding the case m 2 if h s 3 then tv s 2 h s 1 and if h s 4 then h s 1 tv s 2 h s 2 and both values are possible in particular we present a proof of doignon s theorem the special case of theorem 1 where s z 2 remark theorem 1 shows that s tverberg numbers of planar sets are very closely related to s helly numbers see ave 13 ags 17 and the references there however for the case h s 4 the bounds on tv s 2 given above cannot be improved for example s 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 and z 2 both have helly number four but tv z 2 2 6 while the pigeonhole principle implies that tv s 2 5 tverberg theorems over discrete sets of points 3 our second main result improves the upper bound on the integer tverberg numbers for the three dimensional case s z 3 theorem 2 the following inequality holds for all m 2 tv z 3 m 24 m 31 our third main result is an inequality that will be used to derive improved bounds on s tverberg numbers when s is a product of a euclidean space with some subset s of a euclidean space theorem 3 let s rj be a subset of a euclidean space then for all positive integers k and all m 2 we have tv s rk m tv s tv rk m for example choosing s of the form zj rk leads to the mixed integer case then theorem 3 implies that for all positive integers j k and all m 2 we have tv zj rk m tv zj tv rk m moreover we will use theorem 3 to obtain the following bound 1 2 j m 1 k 1 1 tv zj rk m j 2 j m 1 k 1 1 our fourth main result is a generalization of pach s positive fraction selection lemma pac 98 see kkp 15 for related bounds here is pach s result given an integer d there exists a constant cd such that for any set p of n points in rd there exists a point q rd and d 1 disjoint subsets of p say p 1 pd 1 such that pi cd n for all i and the simplex defined by every transversal of p 1 pd 1 contains q by transversal we mean a set containing exactly one element from each pi unfortunately the point q need not be an integer point furthermore the proof uses the so called second selection lemma that currently does not exist for in teger points see pach pac 98 and matous ek mat 02 chapter 9 in section 4 we strengthen the above theorem such that as a consequence the theorem now extends to the integer case indeed to any scenario where one has points of high half space depth in the following sense given a finite set p of points in rd and a point q rd we say that q is of half space depth t with respect to p if any half space containing q contains at least t points of p when the context is clear we will simply say that q is of depth t then here is our theorem theorem 4 for any integer d 1 and real number 0 1 there exists a constant cd such that the following holds for any set p of n points in rd and any point q rd of half space depth at least n there exist d 1 disjoint subsets of p say p 1 pd 1 such that pi cd n for i 1 d 1 and every simplex defined by a transversal of p 1 pd 1 contains q remark our proof yields a constant cd whose value is exponential in the dimension d 4 j a de loera t a hogan f meunier and n h mustafa note that the existence of integer points of high half space depth lemma 1 to gether with theorem 4 implies the following integer version of the positive fraction selection lemma corollary 1 let p be a set of n d 1 points in zd then there exists a point q zd and d 1 disjoint subsets of p say p 1 pd 1 such that pi cd 2 d n for all i 1 d 1 and the simplex defined by every transversal of p 1 pd 1 contains q remark in particular this implies that q belongs to many distinct tverberg partitions at least dcd 2 d ne d distinct tverberg partitions with each such tverberg partition containing cd 2 d n sets related results and organization of the paper the problem of computing the tverberg number for zd with d 3 seems to be challenging it has been identified as an interesting problem since the 1970 s gs 79 and yet the following inequalities are almost all that is known about this problem for the general case de loera et al dlhrs 17 proved 2 2 d m 1 1 tv zd m d 2 d m 1 1 for d 1 and m 2 two special cases get better bounds 3 tv z 3 2 17 and 5 2 d 2 1 tv zd 2 for d 1 the left hand side inequality is due to bezdek and blokhuis bb 03 and the right hand side was proved by doignon in his phd thesis and rediscovered by onn previously established bounds for the mixed integer case include the bounds for the radon number 2 tverberg number found by averkov and weismantel aw 12 2 j k 1 1 tv zj rk 2 j k 2 j k 1 j k 2 later de loera et al dlhrs 17 gave the following general bound for all mixed integer tverberg numbers tv zj rk m j k 2 j m 1 k 1 1 note that 1 above is a simultaneous improvement of both of these previous bounds and related work on more general s tverberg numbers can also be found in dlhrs 17 including the following bound for any discrete s rd tv s m h s m 1 d 1 the following lemma about integer points of high half space depth is used through out the paper see bo 16 for a proof and related results lemma 1 consider a multiset a of points in zd if a 2 d m 1 1 counting multiplicities then there is a point q zd of half space depth m in a the paper is organized as follows in section 1 we prove theorem 1 using a some what similar strategy to birch s proof of the planar case of the original tverberg theorem bir 59 in section 2 we prove theorem 2 using techniques reminiscent of those in dlhrs 17 in section 3 we prove theorem 3 adapting an approach by mulzer and werner mw 13 lemma 2 3 and collect some consequences of the main tverberg theorems over discrete sets of points 5 theorems presented above including 1 finally in section 4 we prove theorem 4 by proving a new lemma and adapting the methods of pach in pac 98 1 tverberg numbers over discrete subsets of r 2 proof of theorem 1 we start with the proof of the special case s z 2 because it nicely illustrates the techniques of the more general proof of theorem 1 1 1 proof of the special case s z 2 the theorem will follow easily from the following two lemmas the first covering the case m 3 and the second the case m 2 lemma 2 consider a multiset a of points in z 2 with a 4 m 3 and m 3 if p a is a point of depth m then there is an m tverberg partition of a with p as tverberg point lemma 3 consider a multiset a of points in z 2 with a 6 if p a is a point of depth two then there is a radon partition of a with p as tverberg point proof of special case s z 2 consider a multiset a of at least 4 m 3 points in z 2 by lemma 1 a has an integer point p of depth m if p is an element of a with multiplicity then take the singletons p as of the sets in the tverberg partition then p is a point of depth m of the remaining 4 m 3 points if m we are done and if m 1 the point p is in the convex hull of the remaining points and we take them to be the last set in the desired partition if m 3 according to lemma 2 there is an m tverberg partition of the remaining points with p as tverberg point there is thus an m tverberg partition of a with p as tverberg point the case m 2 is treated similarly with the help of lemma 3 in place of lemma 2 proof of lemma 2 since p is not in a up to a radial projection we can assume that the points of a are arranged in a circle around p define q and r to be respectively the quotient and the remainder of the euclidean division of a by m define moreover e to be d r q e suppose first that p is a point of depth m e in such a case we arbitrarily select a first point in a and label clockwise the points with elements in m according to the following pattern 1 2 m 1 2 e 1 2 m 1 2 e 1 2 m 1 2 k where k a qm q 1 e note that we have k e each half plane delimited by a line passing through p contains at least m e consecutive points in this pattern and thus has at least one point with each of the m different labels partitioning the points so that each subset consists of all points with a fixed label we therefore obtain an m tverberg partition with p as tverberg point suppose now that p is not a point of depth m e there is thus a closed half plane h delimited by a line passing through p with h a m e the complementary closed half plane to h which we denote by h is such that h a 4 m 3 m e define to be h a since e m 3 we have 6 j a de loera t a hogan f meunier and n h mustafa figure 1 labeling of the points in the half plane h 2 m denote the points in h a by x 1 x where the indices are increasing when we move clockwise we label xi with r i from x 1 to xm r and then label xm r j with j from xm r 1 to xm we then continue labeling the points of a still moving clockwise using labels 1 2 m 1 2 m 1 2 r see figure 1 for an illustration of the labeling scheme the labeling pattern is such that any sequence of m consecutive points either has all m labels or contains the two consecutive points xm and xm 1 let us prove that any closed half plane h delimited by a line passing through p contains at least one point with each label once this is proved the conclusion will be immediate by taking as subsets of points those with same labels as above if such an h does not simultaneously contain xm and xm 1 then h contains at least one point with each label consider thus a closed half plane h delimited by a line passing through p and containing xm and xm 1 note that according to farkas lemma sch 03 theorem 5 3 xm 1 cannot be separated from x 1 and x by a line passing through p since they are all in h this means that either h contains x 1 x 2 xm 1 or h contains xm 1 xm 2 x in any case h contains a point with each label proof of lemma 3 as before we assume that the points in a are arranged on a circle centered at p if a is even it clearly suffices to label the points in order alternating between 1 and 2 we may therefore assume that a is odd and thus a 7 if p is a point of depth three it suffices to label the points alternating labels between 1 and 2 except with two consecutive points labeled 1 if a is odd but p is not a point of depth three then a 7 and there is a half plane h containing p with h a 2 the complementary half plane h has h a 5 and we follow a similar strategy as in the second half of lemma 2 namely we denote the points in h a by x 1 x where the indices are increasing when we move clockwise then we label x 1 with 2 x 2 with 1 x 3 with 1 and x 4 with 2 we continue this pattern for 5 labeling x with 1 if is odd and x with 2 if is even for the remaining points in a we continue labeling clockwise alternating between the labels 1 and 2 tverberg theorems over discrete sets of points 7 the labeling pattern is such that any sequence of 2 consecutive points either has both labels or contains the two consecutive points x 2 and x 3 as in lemma 2 it suffices to show that any closed half plane h delimited by a line passing through p contains at least one point with each label if such an h does not simultaneously contain x 2 and x 3 then h contains at least one point with each label consider thus a closed half plane h delimited by a line passing through p and containing x 2 and x 3 note that according to farkas lemma x 3 cannot be separated from x 1 and x 4 by a line passing through p since they are all in h this means that either h contains x 1 x 2 x 3 or h contains x 3 and x 4 in any case h contains a point with each label 1 2 proof of the general case the proof of the general case is split into three lemmas addressing the lower bound the upper bound for h s 4 and the upper bound for h s 3 respectively lemma 4 for any discrete set s r 2 with finite helly number h s we have tv s m h s m 1 proof it suffices to exhibit a subset r s of cardinality r h s m 1 with the property that no point in s is of half space depth m with respect to r by lemma 2 6 in adls 17 there exists a set r of h s points in s in convex position with the property that conv r s r let r be the multiset given by taking each point in r with multiplicity m 1 so r h s m 1 no points of s r are in conv r since r was taken to be in convex position for any point in r there exists a line such that one side of that line has at most m 1 points in r thus s cannot contain a point of half space depth m with respect to r lemma 5 for any discrete set s r 2 with finite helly number h s 4 we have tv s m h s m 1 1 whenever m 3 for the case m 2 we have tv s 2 h s 2 proof the proof of lemma 5 is the same as the proof of theorem 1 in particular we can use lemmas 2 and 3 as they are stated except that we use the following result theorem 2 in bo 16 with being the uniform probability measure on a in place of lemma 1 for any discrete discrete subset s of a euclidean space with finite helly number h s and any set a s with a h s m 1 1 there exists a point p s that is of half space depth m with respect to a lemma 6 for a discrete set s r 2 with finite helly number h s 3 we have tv s m h s m 1 1 proof the case h s 1 implies that s consists of a single point so the result trivially follows if h s 2 it must be that all points in s are collinear as any set containing a non degenerate triangle has helly number at least 3 and thus we can take median of any set with at least 2 m 1 1 points in s as the desired m tverberg point thus for the remainder of the proof we assume that h s 3 given any set a of h s m 1 3 m 2 points in s there exists an m tverberg partition say p by the classical tverberg theorem we denote by k 1 km the 8 j a de loera t a hogan f meunier and n h mustafa m convex hulls of the subsets in p as 1 i mki is a nonempty polygon say q possibly just a point or line segment we pick an arbitrary vertex q of q it suffices to show that q s we can assume that q is not a vertex of any ki since otherwise q a s since q is a vertex of q it must be contained in a one dimensional face f 1 of at least one ki since q is not a vertex of any ki in fact q is in the relative interior of f 1 for q to be a vertex of q it must also be in another one dimensional face say f 2 of some other ki such that f 1 is not parallel to f 2 moreover q must be in the relative interior of f 2 and we also have f 1 f 2 q denote by a b and c d the vertices of f 1 and f 2 respectively we have that a b c d s are the vertices of a convex quadrilateral with diagonals intersecting at q by the assumption that f 1 and f 2 are non parallel out of the four trian gles conv a b c conv a b d conv a c d conv b c d any three have at least one vertex in common and therefore intersect in s since h s 3 the four triangles therefore all intersect in s this intersection point is q the point where the diagonals of the quadrilateral intersect 2 tverberg numbers over z 3 proof of theorem 2 we state the following lemma without proof it is a consequence upon close inspec tion of the argument of the proof of the main theorem in the already mentioned paper by bezdek and blokhuis bb 03 lemma 7 consider a multiset a of at least 17 points in r 3 and a point p of depth 3 in a there is a bipartition of a into two subsets whose convex hulls contain p next we prove the following lemma 8 consider a multiset a of points in r 3 with a 24 m 31 and m 2 if p a is a point of depth 3 m 3 then there is an m tverberg partition of a with p as tverberg point proof since p is not an element of a we assume without loss of generality that the points of a are located on a sphere centered at p as in the proof of theorem 1 we claim that there exist pairwise disjoint subsets x 1 x 2 xm 2 of a each having p in its convex hull and each being of cardinality at most 4 here pairwise disjoint means that each element of a is present in a number of xi s that does not exceed its multiplicity in a we proceed by contradiction suppose that we can find at most s m 2 such subsets xi s then by carathe odory s theorem p is not in the convex hull of the remaining points in a therefore there is a half space h delimited by a plane containing p such that h a s i 1 xi on the other hand since each xi contains p in its convex hull and we can assume the xi are minimal with respect to containing p we have h xi 3 for all i s therefore h a h s i 1 xi 3 s 3 m 2 which is a contradiction since p is a point of depth 3 m 3 in a there are thus m 2 disjoint subsets x 1 x 2 xm 2 as claimed tverberg theorems over discrete sets of points 9 let x denote m 2 i 1 xi consider an arbitrary half space h delimited by a plane containing p since h xi 3 for all i we have h x 3 m 2 furthermore h a 3 m 3 so h a x 3 since h is arbitrary p is a point of depth 3 of a x also a x a 4 m 2 20 m 23 17 so lemma 7 implies that a x can be partitioned into two sets whose convex hulls contain p with the subsets xi we have therefore an m tverberg partition of a with p as tverberg point from these two lemmas we can now finish the proof of theorem 2 proof of theorem 2 consider a multiset a of 24 m 31 points in z 3 the case m 2 is the already mentioned result by bezdek and blokhuis assume that m 3 applying lemma 1 a has an integer point p of depth 3 m 3 if p is an element of a with multiplicity then take the singletons p as of the sets in the tverberg partition if m we are done if m 1 the point p is still in the convex hull of points in a and thus we are done and if m 2 the point p is still a point of depth 3 m 3 3 m 3 of the remaining 24 m 31 24 m 31 points thus we may apply lemma 8 to get an m tverberg partition of the remaining points with p as tverberg point and conclude the result 3 tverberg numbers over q rk proof of theorem 3 in this section we prove theorem 3 we adapt an approach by mulzer and werner mw 13 lemma 2 3 and show how the results of our paper can be com bined to improve known bounds and to determine new exact values for the tverberg number in the mixed integer case as well as better bounds for certain s tverberg numbers proof of theorem 3 let t tv rk m m 1 k 1 1 choose a multiset a in s rk with a tv s t it suffices to prove that a can be partitioned into m subsets whose convex hulls contain a common point in s rk let a be the projection of a onto s since a tv s t there is a partition of a into t submultisets q 1 q t whose convex hulls contain a common point q in s the q i are the projections onto s of t disjoint subsets qi forming a partition of a for each i t we can find a point qi conv qi projecting onto q the t points q 1 qt belong to q rk as t tv rk m there exists a partition of t into i 1 im and a point p q rk such that p conv i i qi for all m for each m define a to be i i qi we have for each m p conv i i qi conv i i conv qi conv a and the a form the desired partition here are the new bounds and exact values we get 1 tv z rk m 2 m 1 k 1 1 10 j a de loera t a hogan f meunier and n h mustafa 2 tv z 2 rk m 4 m 1 k 1 1 3 tv z 3 rk m 24 m 1 k 1 7 4 2 j m 1 k 1 1 tv zj rk m j 2 j m 1 k 1 1 5 if s r 2 with finite helly number h s then tv s rk m h s m 1 k 1 1 the lower bound in 4 is obtained by repeated applications of proposition 1 below the upper bounds follow from theorem 3 combined with the fact that tv z m 2 m 1 theorem 1 for s z 2 theorem 2 the upper bound in equation 2 and theorem 1 respectively proposition 1 let j and k be two non negative integers then we have tv zj 1 rk m 2 tv zj rk m 2 we prove proposition 1 by following the idea of the proof of proposition 2 1 in onn 91 proof of proposition 1 assume toward a contradiction that tv zj 1 rk m 2 tv zj rk m 2 choose a to be a set of tv zj rk m 1 points in zj rk with no m tverberg partition let ai a i a a i 0 1 since a 0 a 1 zj 1 rk has cardinality 2 tv zj rk m 2 there exists an m tverberg partition y 1 y 2 ym of a 0 a 1 with p i m conv yi furthermore p is in z j 1 rk that implies either p conv a 0 or p conv a 1 in either case a 0 or a 1 has an m tverberg partition a contradiction with our choice of a 4 a generalized fraction selection lemma proof of theorem 4 our proof relies on the simplicial partition theorem of matous ek used in a similar manner as in mr 17 which states the following theorem 5 mat 92 see also cha 00 given an integer d 1 and a parameter r there exists a constant cd 1 such that for any set p of n points in rd there exists an integer s and a partition p 1 ps of p such that for each i 1 s n r pi 2 nr and any hyperplane intersects the convex hull of less than cd r 1 1 d sets of the partition the constant cd is independent of p and depends only on d we now prove the following key lemma lemma 9 for any integer d 1 there exists a constant cd such that the following holds for any set p of n points in rd and a real number 0 1 there exists a partition p p 1 pr r 4 cd d of p such that n 2 r pi 2 nr for each i 1 r and tverberg theorems over discrete sets of points 11 the convex hull of any transversal q of p contains all points in rd of half space depth at least n proof apply the simplicial partition theorem theorem 5 to p with r 4 cd d and let the resulting partition be p 1 p s note that as n r p i 2 n r for each i 1 s we have r 2 s r now partition arbitrarily each of r s biggest sets in p 1 p s into two equal parts and let the resulting partition be p 1 pr clearly each set of this partition has size in the interval n 2 r 2 n r this proves the first part note also that each hyperplane intersects the convex hull of at most twice as many sets i e less than 2 cd r 1 1 d sets of the partition p 1 pr to see the second part let c be any point of half space depth at least n and q any transversal of p for contradiction assume that c conv q then there exists a hyperplane h containing c in one of its two open half spaces say h and containing conv q in the half space h we will show that then there exists an index i 1 r such that pi h but then pi q a contradiction to the fact that q is a transversal of p it remains to show the existence of a set pi p such that pi h towards this we bound p h each point of p lying in h belongs to a set p p such that either p h in which case we are done or p h ash contains at least one point of p we must have conv p h 6 as argued earlier there are less than 2 cd r 1 1 d such sets thus we have p h 2 cd r 1 1 d 2 n r 4 cd n 4 cd d 1 d n 4 on the other hand as c has half space depth at least n and c h we have p h n a contradiction to inequality 4 remark in particular for r 4 cd d there exist at least n 2 r r r sized subsets each of whose convex hull contains all integer points of depth at least n proof of theorem 4 given the point set p in rd and a point q rd of half space depth n apply lemma 9 with p and to get a partition consisting of r d 1 sets where r 4 cd d by discarding at most n 2 points of p we can derive a partition on the remaining points of p say p p 1 pr such that the pi s are equal sized disjoint subsets of p i e pi n 2 r for all i 1 r furthermore every transversal of p contains all points in rd of half space depth at least n and thus q for each transversal q of p the point q lies in the convex hull of q and by carathe odory s theorem there exists a d 1 sized subset of q whose convex hull 12 j a de loera t a hogan f meunier and n h mustafa also contains q by the pigeonhole principle there must exist d 1 sets of p say the sets p 1 pd 1 such that at least 5 n 2 r r r d 1 n 2 r r d 1 n 2 r d 1 er d 1 d 1 1 er d 1 d 1 d 1 i 1 pi distinct transversals of p 1 pd 1 contain q the rest of the proof follows the one of pach pac 98 in brief we view the pi s as parts of a d 1 partite hypergraph with vertices corresponding to points in p and a hyperedge corresponding to each transversal of p containing q as there are nd 1 such transversals by inequality 5 we apply a weak form of the hypergraph version of szemere di s regularity lemma see mat 92 theorem 9 4 1 to derive the existence of constant fraction sized subsets p 1 p 1 p d 1 pd 1 such that the following is true for some constant c d for any p 1 p 1 p d 1 p d 1 with p i c d p i for i 1 d 1 we have the property that there exists at least one transversal of p 1 p d 1 whose convex hull contains q then the same type lemma bv 98 theorem 2 applied to p 1 p d 1 q gives constant fraction sized subsets x 1 p 1 xd 1 p d 1 such that each transversal of x 1 xd 1 has the same order type with respect to q we can set up the parameters for the same type lemma and the weak regularity lemma such that xi c d p i for all i 1 d 1 then the weak regularity lemma implies that there exists at least one transversal of x 1 xd 1 that contains q however as each transversal of x 1 xd 1 has the same order type it must be that each transversal of x 1 xd 1 contains q these are the required subsets the size of each xi is a constant fraction of n say xi cd n where the constant cd depends on the constants in inequality 5 in the weak regularity lemma and in the same type lemma all of these depend only on and d 5 acknowledgments
