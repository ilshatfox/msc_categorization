generalizing the classical area measures they have been used to provide general integral formulas for mixed volumes see hug rataj and weil 2017 here we consider an image measure j k of flag measures defined on the grassmannian g d j of affine j spaces 1 j d 1 and show that it determines centrally symmetric bodies k of dimension j 1 uniquely we then explain that grassmann measures appear in the representation of smooth translation invariant continuous and even valuations due to alesker 2003 using this connection we prove a uniqueness result for projection averages of area measures and we finally discuss a grassmann version of the natural touching measure of convex bodies 1 introduction let kd be the space of convex bodies non empty compact convex sets in rd d 2 supplied with the hausdorff metric classical descriptors of bodies k kd are the area measures j k j 1 d 1 these are finite borel measures on the unit sphere sd 1 which arise from a local steiner formula and which determine the body k uniquely up to a translation and under a dimensional condition the total measure vj k j k s d 1 is the jth intrinsic volume of k see 23 for definitions properties and further results on area measures and intrinsic volumes as well as for all other notions from convex geometry which appear throughout the following as a more recent development measures on flag manifolds have been introduced and studied to describe convex bodies a survey is given in 16 they also have a history in geometric measure theory see 16 for details flag measures allow to extend formulas for mixed volumes and projection functions from special cases where area measures are involved to more general situations see 5 14 15 there are several isomorphic representations possible for these measures in the following we concentrate on the measure j k which is a finite measure on the flag space f d j 1 u l u l sd 1 l g d j 1 j 1 d 1 here g d k denotes the grassmannian of k dimensional subspaces in rd since the area measure j k appears as the image of j k under the projection u l 7 u the flag measure contains more information on the boundary structure of a body k in case j d 2 clearly j k also determines the body k up to translations and under the restrictions mentioned above it is a first goal of date july 29 2021 2010 mathematics subject classification 52 a 20 52 a 38 52 a 39 53 b 45 key

paper to study another image of flag measures namely the measure j k j 1 d 1 on g d j which arises from the mapping u l 7 u l it may be called the jth grassmann measure of k for j d 1 this image measure just corresponds to the symmetrized area measure 1 2 d 1 k d 1 k if we identify the subspace u rd with the vector u sd 1 or with u therefore we concentrate on the case j d 2 in the following since j k is invariant under translations k 7 k x x rd and reflections k 7 k a uniqueness result can only be expected for k in the class kds k k d k k of centrally symmetric convex bodies the following is our first result it involves the invariant probability measure j on g d j and the projection function l 7 vj k l l g d j of a convex body k theorem 1 1 for j 1 d 2 we have j k a a vj k l j dl for all k kd and all borel sets a g d j corollary 1 2 let k k kds with dimk j dimk j j 1 d 2 then j k j k implies k k in the proof of theorem 1 1 we will use the connection between grassmann measures and even valuations we recall that a real valued functional on kd is called a valuation if it is additive in the sense that k m k m k m whenever k m and k m lie in kd in the following all valuations are assumed to be translation invariant and continuous w r t the hausdorff metric let val be the vector space of all these valuations and let val resp val be the subspace of even resp odd valuations for j 0 d a valuation val is j homogeneous if k j k k kd 0 mcmullen 17 19 has shown that there is a direct decomposition 1 1 val d j 0 valj d j 0 val j val j into the spaces of even and odd j homogeneous valuations which are again trans lation invariant and continuous here the cases j 0 and j d are simple the valuations are constants respectively constant multiples of the volume vd there fore we concentrate on j 1 d 1 in the following for j d 1 mcmullen 18 has shown that vald 1 if and only if 1 2 k sd 1 f u d 1 k du k k d for some continuous function f f on the unit sphere s d 1 which is uniquely determined up to a linear function it follows that is even if f is even and odd if f is odd for 1 j d 2 a similar description of valj is not possible at least not with area measures for the subclass val j val j of smooth valuations we have the following result grassmann measures of convex bodies 3 theorem 1 3 for a valuation val j j 1 d 2 there is a c function f on g d j such that k f d j f u l j k d u l g d j f l j k dl g d j f l vj k l j dl for all k kd for val j the representation 1 3 k g d j f l vj k l j dl with a smooth function f follows from alesker s irreducibility theorem and is con tained in alesker s work see 1 p 73 here we obtain the result through the connection with grassmann measures we remark that for j d 1 the theorem also holds with the above mentioned interpretation of d 1 k but reduces to the symmetric and smooth version of mcmullen s result 1 2 for 1 j d 1 the function f is no longer unique as we shall also see in the course of explaining the connection between theorem 1 1 and theorem 1 3 we come across a third topic which we want to discuss namely projection averages as a generalization of the classical cauchy kubota formula for intrinsic volumes see 23 or 24 schneider 21 proved a projection formula for area measures 1 4 g d k j k e a e k de c k d j d k j j k a for 1 j k d 1 k kd with dimk k and all borel sets a sd 1 here j k e is the area measure of k e calculated in the subspace e and hence a measure on sd 1 e and c k d j d k j is a dimensional constant see section 2 of course this implies that the projection average g d k j k e e k de determines k uniquely up to translations and under the mentioned dimensional restriction if we consider the corresponding integral g d k j k e k de where the jth area measure of the projection k e is averaged as a measure on sd 1 the resulting measure is homogeneous of degree j in k but is not propor tional to the area measure j k anymore in fact it is not locally defined thus the question arises whether this projection average also determines k we obtain a positive result for centrally symmetric bodies theorem 1 4 let k k kds with dimk j dimk j j 1 d 2 then g d k j k e k de g d k j k e k de for j k d 1 implies k k 4 wolfgang weil surprisingly the corresponding result is wrong in general if the symmetry of the bodies k k is skipped we shall give a corresponding example in the case j 1 finally we discuss the connection between the grassmann measures and touch ing measures as they were treated in 24 section 8 6 as a further result we obtain that a centrally symmetric body k of dimension j is uniquely determined up to translation by its d j 1 st direction measure d j 1 k j 1 d 2 the latter is the image of the touching measure d j 1 k defined in 24 p 358 if the affine d j 1 dimensional subspaces e touching k are mapped to their direction spaces l e g d d j 1 theorem 1 5 let k k kds with dimk j dimk j j 1 d 2 then d j 1 k d j 1 k implies k k the setup of the paper is as follows in the next section we collect some further basic facts from convex geometry which we will use including a description of various flag measures we then discuss the grassmann measures and collect some of their simple properties in section 3 we collect more information about valuations which is used later on in the subsequent sections we give the proofs of theorems 1 1 1 3 1 4 and 1 5 2 facts from convex geometry measures on flag manifolds as descriptors of convex bodies are of more recent origin they can be introduced by a local steiner formula in the affine grassmannian a d k which defines a whole series of flag measures or by projection averages of area measures there is also a direct approach which uses measure geometric tools and defines flag measures as integrals with respect to the hausdorff measure on the generalized normal bundle of the body we refer to 16 for a survey on flag measures which contains also historical remarks and gives further references in the following we concentrate on the measure j k for k k d and j 1 d 1 which we define as a measure on the flag space f d j 1 by a projection mean here for 1 k d f d k u e e g d k u sd 1 e then 2 1 j k g d j 1 sd 1 e 1 u e j k e du j 1 de where j k e denotes the area measure of k e computed in e and j 1 is the rotation invariant probability measure on g d j 1 for the necessary measura bility properties needed here and in the following we refer to 12 as a variant of f d k one can use f d d k u e e g d d k u sd 1 e which is obviously homeomorphic to f d k under the orthogonality map u l 7 u l both spaces f d k and f d d k carry natural topologies thus j k can also be interpreted as a measure on f d d j 1 another isomor phic representation results if we consider the image of j k under the bijection grassmann measures of convex bodies 5 u e 7 u e u where e u denotes the linear hull of e u the result ing measure sits on f d d j and is the measure considered in 13 eq 3 1 first defined for polytopes by a sum over all j faces and extended to arbitrary k kd by continuity this latter measure was also used in 5 in 16 as well as in 12 a series of flag measures s k m k on f d k was introduced by a local steiner formula see also 5 p 5 here the connection to the measure j k is given by f d j 1 f u l j k d u l cd j f d d j 1 f v m s d j 1 j k d v m 2 2 this is essentially formula 2 1 in 5 where also the constant cd j is given in 14 a flag measure j k on f d d 1 j was used in a measure geometric context which satisfies j k c d js d 1 j j k with a constant c d j given explicitly in 5 eq 2 4 the image measure of j k under the mapping u l 7 u is proportional to the area measure j k as follows from the local projection formula 1 4 g d j 1 j k l l j 1 dl c j 1 d j d 1 j k for j 1 d 2 here c k m l n k km m l ln n where i is the i dimensional volume of the unit ball in r i this shows that the flag measure j k determines bodies k of dimension j 1 uniquely up to a translation since d 1 k d 1 k if we identify u r d and u we are mostly interested in the case j d 2 in the following for 1 j d 2 we now define the jth grassmann measure j k on g d j as the image measure of j k under the mapping u l 7 u l the grassmann measures inherit some properties from the corresponding flag mea sures namely j k is translation invariant and rotation covariant that is j k a j k 1 a for k kd a g d j a borel set and so d the mapping k 7 j k is additive hence a valuation homogeneous of degree j and continuous w r t the weak topology for measures and the hausdorff metric on kd there is also a local steiner type formula for grassmann measures in fact j k tb d is a polynomial in t 0 and the coefficients are measures on g d j indexed by two parameters if k has dimension j then j k 0 if dimk j then j k vj k l k where vj k denotes the jth intrin sic volume of k and l k is the dirac measure concentrated on the linear space l k g d j parallel to the affine hull of k 6 wolfgang weil for k kds and a borel set a g d j 2 1 implies j k a g d j 1 sd 1 e 1 u e a j k e du j 1 de g d j 1 j k e ae j 1 de g d j 1 j e k e a e j 1 de 2 3 where ae u e s d 1 u e a a e l g d j l a l e and where j e k e is the image measure on g d j of j k e under the mapping u 7 u e the representation 2 3 resembles the projection formula 1 4 but the latter is not directly applicable here it might appear natural to consider as an alternative to j k the image j k of j k under the projection u l 7 l this image is a measure on g d j 1 as we shall see in section 7 it is directly related to the touching measure d j 1 k and is connected to j k by a radon transform for the applications to even valuations and to projection averages the measure j k seems to be more appropriate there is another measure on the grassmannian g d j which describes centrally symmetric bodies k from a dense subclass of kds the generalized zonoids this is the jth projection generating measure j k which was first mentioned with this name in 9 section 6 but appeared in equivalent form in various earlier formulas for zonoids and generalized zonoids see also 23 p 308 the latter is a finite signed measure on g d j defined as the image of the measure 2 j j dj u 1 uj k du 1 k duj on sd 1 j under the mapping u 1 uj 7 lin u 1 uj here k is the generating measure of k lin u 1 uj is the linear subspace generated by u 1 uj and dj u 1 uj is the absolute value of the determinant of u 1 uj in this subspace this value is interpreted as 0 if u 1 uj are not linearly inde pendent the name for j k comes from the fact that 2 4 vj k l g d j l m j k dm l g d j for a generalized zonoid k see 9 eq 6 1 here l m is the absolute value of the determinant of the orthogonal projection of l ontom the measure d 1 k is up to the identification u u u proportional to the area measure d 1 k therefore 2 4 holds in this case j d 1 for all k k d s for j d 2 however there is no continuous extension of 2 4 to all bodies k kds with a measure one has to use distributions on g d j grassmann measures of convex bodies 7 3 more on valuations besides general valuations we also consider smooth ones here a valuation val is called smooth if the mapping gl d val a 7 a is infinitely differentiable see 23 sec 6 5 the subspaces val j val j val j of smooth valuations in valj val j val j are dense for valj the flag function ij of is the uniquely determined centred continuous function on f d j 1 defined by 3 1 k l sd 1 l ij u l j k l du for u l f d j 1 here we have used mcmullen s result 1 2 in l the mapping ij 7 ij from valj into the banach space co f d j 1 of centred continuous functions on f d j 1 is linear continuous and injective see e g 6 the injectivity implies that valj is even odd if and only if ij is even odd the restriction of ij to even valuations corresponds to the klain embedding and shows that 3 2 ij u l ij u l 2 kj l u where kj is the klain function of a continuous function on g d j the following result gives a connection between the grassmann measure and the klain function theorem 3 1 let k kds and val j j 1 d 2 then 3 3 g d j kj m j k dm g d j 1 k l j 1 dl proof by definition of the grassmann measure and equations 3 2 2 1 and 3 1 we have g d j kj m j k dm f d j 1 kj u l j k d u l f d j 1 ij u l j k d u l g d j 1 sd 1 e ij u e j k e du j 1 de g d j 1 k e j 1 de if a valuation val j satisfies k g d j vj k l dl k k d s with a finite signed borel measure on g d j this measure is called a crofton measure for see 3 25 the name arises from the fact that is proportional to 8 wolfgang weil the crofton type integral a d d j v 0 k e de where is the translation invariant measure on the affine grassmannian a d d j with direction measure the image measure of under l 7 l see 24 crofton measures play an important role in the geometry of finsler spaces and also in the description of even minkowski valuations kds k d s suppose val j admits a crofton measures then for a j dimensional body k in a subspace m g d j k kj m vj k g d j vj k l dl g d j l m vj k dl hence 3 4 kj cj in the opposite direction if 3 4 holds for some val j and a measure on g d j then is a crofton measure for this follows easily if a valuation is defined by k g d j vj k l dl for k kd then val j and has crofton measure therefore as we have just seen kj cj kj which implies 4 proof of theorem 1 1 the proof is based on the connection between the grassmann measure j k and the projection generating measure j k in 16 corollary 3 and remark 4 the flag measure j k of a generalized zonoid k was expressed in terms of the generating measure k using this result and the notions explained there we get j k 2 j j sd 1 sd 1 g d j 1 dj u 1 l uj l 1 tl l u 1 l uj l j 1 dl k du 1 k duj 2 j j g d j 1 sd 1 sd 1 dj u 1 l uj l 1 tl l u 1 l uj l k du 1 k duj j 1 dl 2 j j g d j 1 sd 1 sd 1 dj u 1 uj lin u 1 uj l 1 tl l u 1 l uj l k du 1 k duj j 1 dl grassmann measures of convex bodies 9 hence j k 2 j j g d j 1 sd 1 sd 1 dj u 1 uj lin u 1 uj l 1 lin u 1 uj l k du 1 k duj j 1 dl g d j 1 g d j 1 m l m l j k dm j 1 dl since m l m m l and using fubini and the fact that g d j 1 1 m l m m l j 1 dl g d j 1 n m n j dn for fixed m g d j here the condition j d 2 is essential we arrive at 4 1 j k g d j g d j m n j k dm 1 n j dn the inner integral is the cosine transform cj j k n of j k on the grassmannian g d j from theorem 5 3 5 in 23 and the subsequent remarks on p 306 we get that vj k l cj j k l hence theorem 1 1 is proved for generalized zonoids k by approximation it follows for arbitrary k kds in order to extend the result to bodies k kd we define two valuations 1 2 by 1 k g d j g l j k dl and 2 k g d j g l vj k l j dl for k kd here g is an arbitrary continuous function on g d j obviously both valuations are even and they agree on all bodies k kds this implies 1 2 e g since they have the same klain function letting g vary we get the desired result using 4 1 and fubini s theorem we also obtain a direct formula connecting j k and j k proposition 4 1 for a generalized zonoid k and a borel set a g d j we have j k a g d j cj a j l j k dl where aj denotes the restriction of j to a 10 wolfgang weil 5 proof of theorem 1 3 if valj is even it can be reconstructed from its klain function kj on the set of generalized zonoids in fact for a generalized zonoid k klain showed that k 2 j j sd 1 sd 1 kj lin u 1 uj dj u 1 uj k du 1 k duj see 23 theorem 6 4 12 using the projection generating measure j k we can rewrite this as k g d j kj l j k dl 5 1 since projection generating measures cannot be extended to arbitrary bodies k kds in a continuous way see the discussion in 14 the question of a complete reconstruction is still open we can give here a solution for valuations for which the klain function kj is the cosine transform of a function f c g d j theorem 5 1 let val j j 1 d 2 and f c g d j then we have 5 2 k g d j f l j k dl for all k kds iff 5 3 kj cjf proof assume kj cjf combining 4 1 with 5 1 we get for a generalized zonoid k g d j f n j k dn g d j g d j f n m n j k dm j dn g d j g d j f n m n j dn j k dm g d j kj m j k dm k this implies k g d j f n j k dn for arbitrary k kds by continuity since generalized zonoids are dense in k d s in the other direction let l g d j and k kds k l vj k 0 then our assumption and the definition of the klain function yield kj l vj k k f d j 1 f u l j k d u l g d j 1 sd 1 f u l j k l du j 1 dl grassmann measures of convex bodies 11 for j 1 almost all l the projection k l is j dimensional therefore the area measure j k l is concentrated on the two normals u 0 u 0 of k l in l since vj k l vj k l l we get kj l vj k g d j 1 f u 0 l vj k l j 1 dl vj k g d j 1 f l l l l l j 1 dl vj k g d j f m l m j dm vj k cjf l which yields the assertion we remark that condition 5 2 for symmetric bodies extends to all k kd this follows as in the proof of theorem 1 1 we also remark that the proof of theorem 5 1 given here is completely indepen dent of theorem 1 1 if we take theorem 1 1 into account then 5 2 yields k g d j f l vj k l j dl hence has crofton measure g d j 1 l f l j dl and in this case 5 3 reduces to 3 4 the equivalence of 5 2 and 5 3 thus follows from the equivalence explained at the end of section 3 the range of the cosine transform on g d j was determined by alesker and bernstein 2 and it was shown that the klain function of a smooth valuation val j lies in this range in fact the image of the klain embedding of smooth valuations coincides with the image of the cosine transform on smooth functions from this fact and theorem 5 1 we get theorem 1 3 immediately alesker 1 stated the representation 1 3 in the proof of his theorem 1 1 1 theorem 5 1 indicates that a representation k g d j f l j k dl k k d s with a continuous function f f is not possible for all val j if j 1 d 2 this can be seen explicitly for the mixed volume k v k j m d j where m kds is a fixed body assume k g d j fm l j k dl holds for some function fm c g d j and all k k d s then theorem 1 1 implies v k j m d j g d j fm l vj k l j dl 12 wolfgang weil choosing k l for l g d j yields vd j k l g d j fm l l l j dl if we replace l by l and define f m l fm l we obtain vd j m l cd j f m l d j dl l sincem kds was arbitrary this yields a contradiction as there are bodiesm k d s for which the projection function vd j m ong d d j is not the cosine transform of a measure of the form f m l d j dl more precisely for 2 j d 2 vd j m need not be the cosine transform of a measure at all see the discussion in 14 whereas in the case j 1 it is proportional to the cosine transform of the area measure d 1 m but the latter is not absolutely continuous in general so far the discussion was about the representation k g d j f l j k dl for a valuation val j this is equivalent to 5 4 k f d j 1 g u m j k d u m where g c f d j 1 is of the form g u m f u m u m f d j 1 for some f c g d j thus a more general question would be to ask which even valuations have a representation 5 4 if general functions g c f d j 1 are allowed 6 proof of theorem 1 4 we first describe the connection between the grassmann measure j k and the area measure j k for centrally symmetric bodies to explain this we use the radon transform rk 1 which maps continuous functions f on g d k to even functions on sd 1 by rk 1 f u 1 2 g u k f l uk dl u s d 1 here g u k g u k l g d k u l uk is the invariant probability measure on g u k and we assume k 2 d 1 by duality rk 1 can be extended to a mapping from finite measures on g d k to even measures on sd 1 the transpose r 1 k maps even functions and measures on s d 1 to functions and measures on g d k we also denote the image of a measure on g d k under the orthogonality transform g d k g d d k l 7 l by theorem 6 1 for k kds and j 1 d 2 we have j k rd j 1 j k grassmann measures of convex bodies 13 where j k g d j 1 j k l j 1 dl is the projection mean of the area measure j k of k proof for f co s d 1 the banach space of continuous functions on sd 1 with centroid 0 we consider the valuation f given by k sd 1 f u j k du k k d for a body k kd with dimension j the jth order area measure is proportional to the spherical lebesgue measure in the d j space orthogonal to k hence the klain function of satisfies kj l cr 1 d jf l l g d j chosing f 1 we have kj r 1 d jf 1 hence c 1 using theorem 3 1 and fubini s theorem we thus get sd 1 f u rd j 1 j k du g d j r 1 d jf l j k dl g d j 1 sd 1 f u j k l du j 1 dl sd 1 f u g d j 1 j k l j 1 dl du sd 1 f u j k du since this holds for all continuous functions f we obtain the result from the above proof and theorem 1 1 we obtain sd 1 f u j k du g d j r 1 d jf l j k dl sd 1 f u rd j 1 vj k u du for a continuous function f and the invariant probability measure on sd 1 here we have used theorem 7 1 1 in 24 since rd j 1 vj k u g u d j vj k l ud j dl g u j vj k l u j dl c j d 1 j d 1 0 vj k u as follows from the global version of 1 4 and letting f vary we get the case k j 1 of the following result 14 wolfgang weil corollary 6 2 for k kds a s d 1 and 1 j k d 1 we have 6 1 g d k j k l a k dl c k 1 d k d 1 0 a vj k u du in contrast to 1 4 we integrate here the area measure of k l as a convex body in rd the resulting measure is not locally determined by k and therefore it is not a multiple of j k compare the characterization result for area measures in 20 proof the remaining general case k j 2 follows if we apply the result for j k 1 which is already established and use the steiner formula for area measures and intrinsic volumes in k l l g d k to finish the proof of theorem 1 4 we use the fact that under our dimensional condition and for centrally symmetric k the projection function u 7 vj k u determines k uniquely in fact u 7 vj k u is up to a constant the cosine transform of the area measure j k and the latter determines k it is interesting to notice that in theorem 1 4 the symmetry of the bodies is essential namely for j 1 k 2 and d 3 we have 1 k g d 2 1 k l 2 dl c g d 2 h k l 2 dl c g d 2 h k l 2 dl c h p 2 k 1 p 2 k where c is a certain constant and p 2 k the second projection mean body of k for this notion see 22 4 and the survey 7 and where we have used the connection between the first area measure and the centred support function h via the block operator see e g 8 as was shown by goodey 4 p 2 is not injective in dimension d 14 hence there are two different convex bodies k k r 14 with the same integral mean g d 2 1 k l 2 dl g d 2 1 k l 2 dl since in dimension 14 the fifth multiplier in the spherical harmonic expansion of p 2 vanishes and the others are nonzero see 4 again at least one of the bodies k k has to be asymmetric this case j 1 k 2 also shows that formula 6 1 does not hold in gen eral without the assumption of symmetry of k namely for d 6 14 the second projection body p 2 k does determine k up to translations hence 1 k de termines k whereas the right side of 6 1 obviously does not determine k if k is not symmetric this indicates that a uniqueness theorem for k 7 j k might still hold for general k up to translations and for certain values of d and j even more the cases d j where we have non uniqueness might be rather sporadic as has turned out in similar situations see 10 11 grassmann measures of convex bodies 15 we finish the section with a version of corollary 6 2 in the spirit of proposition 4 1 proposition 6 1 for k kds a borel set a s d 1 and 1 j k d 1 we have g d k sj k l a k dl sd 1 cd 1 a j k u du where aj k denotes the restriction of j k to a 7 touching measures let q k be the natural measure on the space a d q k of affine q flats in r d touching the convex body k see 24 section 8 5 for the definition of this touching measure and its properties the image q k of q k under the mapping e 7 l e is another measure on the grassmannian g d q attributed to k we call it the qth direction measure of k the following result describes the connection between j k and d j 1 k it involves the radon transform rjk c g d j c g d k defined by 7 1 rjkf e g e j f l ej dl e g d k where 0 j k d g e j is the grassmannian of j spaces containing e or contained in e in case j k and ej is the rotation invariant probability measure on g e j the transform rj 1 which we used earlier corresponds to the case k 1 of 7 1 if lines e g d 1 are identified with pairs u u u sd 1 by duality rjk extends to a linear mapping on measures rjk c g d j c g d k through 7 2 g d k f l rjk dl g d j rkjf m dm f c g d k theorem 7 1 the grassmann measure j k satisfies d j 1 k 2 rj j 1 j k proof we know from 24 p 358 that d j 1 k a 2 sod j k l d j 1 td j 1 a d for all borel sets a a d d j 1 k with td j 1 a x l d j 1 ld j 1 x a here ld j 1 is a fixed space in g d d j 1 is the haar probability measure on the rotation group sod and j k denotes the jth curvature measure of k a finite measure concentrated on the boundary of k obviously this can be re written as 7 3 d j 1 k a 2 g d j 1 j k l t a l j 1 dl 16 wolfgang weil where t a l x l l x a hence d j 1 k a d j 1 k 1 a 2 g d j 1 j k l t 1 a l j 1 dl where t 1 a l x l x l 1 a x relbd k l l a we obtain 7 4 d j 1 k a 2 g d j 1 vj k l 1 l a j 1 dl in equivalent form 7 4 yields g d j 1 f l d j

kubota formula for vj in l see 24 theorem 6 2 2 the flag formula theorem 7 1 1 in 24 with the notation given there and theorem 1 1 the assertion follows now from 7 2 letting a vary in 7 4 shows that d j 1 k d j 1 m for k m k d s implies vj k l vj m l for all l g d j 1 this proves theorem 1 5 remark in the background of the considerations above is a connection between the touching measure q k and the flag support measure q d q 1 k discussed in 16 the latter is a measure on rd sd 1 g d q introduced as q d q 1 k g d q 1 g x l k u l l d q 1 k l d x u q dl 7 5 see 16 theorem 4 here l d q 1 k l is the highest order support mea sure of k l calculated in l as the ambient space and g x l k is the point in the boundary of k such that the affine flat l x touches k in g x l k as grassmann measures of convex bodies 17 is shown in 16 this contact point is unique and measurable for given k and q almost all l g d q since l x l g x l k for boundary points x of k l the image measure q k of q d q 1 k under the mapping x u l 7 l x is a measure on a d q k satisfying q k g d q 1 l x l d q 1 k l d x u q dl g d q 1 l x d q 1 k l dx q dl g d d q d q 1 k l t l d q dl 1 2 q k as follows from 7 3 the direction measure q k of k is thus up to the factor 1 2 the image of q k under the mapping e 7 l e e a d q therefore q k is the image of q d q 1 k under x u l 7 l splitting the latter map into x u l 7 u l and u l 7 l and using the fact that the image of q d q 1 k under x u l 7 u l is s q d q 1 k which is connected to d q 1 k via 2 2 we conclude that q k is up to a constant the image of the flag measure d q 1 k under the mapping u l 7 l as theorem 7 1 shows the image of d q 1 k under u l 7 u l corresponds to taking the radon transform rd q d q 1 acknowledgements this research has been
