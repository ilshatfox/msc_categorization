somewhat reformated 1 translation of the old and practically inaccessible paper p kuchment on the question of the affine invariant points of convex bodies in russian optimizacija no 8 25 1972 48 51 127 mr 0350621 there partial solutions of some old problems of b gru nbaum concerning affine invariant points of convex bodies were obtained the main restriction due to which the solution was incomplete was the compactness restriction on the group of linear transformations involved it was noticed recently by o mordhorst arxiv 1601 07850 that a simple additional argument allows one to restrict the consideration to the bodies whose john s ellipsoid is a ball and consequently to a compact group case this in turn extends the result to the complete solution of b gru nbaum s problem see also some partial progress in the previous recent works by m meyer c schu tt and e werner 4 5 the article translated below contains three main statements ex istence of invariant points in the case when the linear parts of affine transformations are taken from a compact group the resulting from this proof of b gru nbaum s conjecture for the case of similarity in variant points and an example precluding the set of all such points from being the convex hull of finitely many of them let rn be the standard n dimensional real vector space we denote by wn the set of all compact convex subsets in rn with non empty interiors we 1 e g some statements that were not as such in the original paper are given the names corollary or theorem 1 http arxiv org abs 1602 04377 v 3 http arxiv org abs 1601 07850 will call them convex bodies the set wn is equipped with the hausdorff metric topology 1 let g be a compact subgroup of the group gl n of invertible linear transformations of rn we denote by the group of affine transformations generated by shifts and elements of g definition 1 a invariant point is a continuous mapping p wn 7 r n such that p a k a p k 1 for any k wn and a definition 2 a invariant point p such that p k k for all k wn is called a invariant point of the body in what follows we will use the abbreviations i point and i point of the body correspondingly let k wn we denote by k the subgroup of consisting of all automorphisms of k i e those leaving k invariant theorem 3 1 let x 0 be a k 0 invariant point located in the interior intk 0 of a convex body k 0 then there exists a invariant point of the body p wn 7 r n such that p k 0 x 0 2 let x 0 be an arbitrary k 0 invariant point then there exists a invariant point p wn 7 r n such that p k 0 x 0 in other words given a convex body k the set of all k invariant points in rn coincides with the set of values p k of all invariant points p proof we will restrict ourselves to the proof of the first statement since the second one is proven analogously we will need to describe some new objects all required properties of equivariant bundles can be found in 2 we define the set w 0 n of classes of equivalence k k in wn with respect to the shift equivalence a metric on w 0 n can be defined as follows k 1 k 2 inf kj kj k 1 k 2 2 2 here on the right denotes the hausdorff distance between convex bodies the general linear group gl n and thus also its subgroup g act naturally on w 0 n g k g k for g gl n 3 let us consider the set e w 0 n r n as a trivial fiber bundle over wn with respect to the natural projection onto the first factor one can introduce on it the structure of a g bundle g k x g k g x 4 we can now define an equivariant sub bundle k e as follows let k k w 0 n then the fiber of k over k is the bodyk r n after shifting it so that its center of mass coincides with the origin 0 due to the continuous dependence of the center of mass on the convex body 1 k is indeed a bundle in these new terms a invariant point a invariant point of the body is a continuous equivariant section of the bundle e respectively of k now the first statement of the theorem can be rephrased as follows let x 0 intk 0 be gk 0 invariant the stationary subgroup gk is defined analogously to k then it can be extended to a continuous equivariant section p of k such that p k 0 x 0 this is the form in which we will be proving it it is known 1 that w 0 n is locally compact we choose a compact neighborhood v of k 0 due to compactness of g the orbit g v is also compact let us restrict the bundle e to g v over the single orbit g k we can define an equivariant section 2 as g k g x 0 it is known 2 that due to the closedness of g k and compactness of g v can be extended to a continuous equivariant section which we denote with the same letter over g v since x 0 belongs to the interior ofk 0 there is a g invariant neighborhood u of the orbit where f int f for any f u consider covering of w 0 n with two g invariant open sets u 1 u u 2 w 0 n g k 0 due to metrizability of w 0 n there exists a subordinate partition of unity 1 k 2 k we can assume these two functions being g invariant other wise we can redefine them as follows i k g i g k d g 5 2 remark during translation gk invariance of x 0 is used 3 where g is the normalized haar measure 3 on g we can now define p k 1 k k 2 k k 6 where k is the zero section of k i e the center of mass of k it is clear that p is a continuous equivariant section of k and p k 0 x 0 this proves the first statement of the theorem the second one as it has been mentioned before is proven by the same method but even easier no restriction p k k to obey in 1 the questions were asked both for affine and similarity invariant points the first case corresponds to g gl n and the second one to the group g of linear transformations preserving orthogonality both these groups are non compact and thus are not covered by our theorem however in the second case of similarity invariant points one can reduce consideration to a compact group case considered above indeed one can assume that the volume of k 0 is equal to 1 we can construct the required section p for the class of bodies of unit volume indeed in this case we deal with the compact orthogonal group o n and the theorem applies then for a body f of an arbitrary volume v we can define the required section as follows p f v 1 np v 1 nf 7 corollary 4 the gru nbaum s problem has positive solution for similarity invariant points however for the gl n case this reduction to the unit volume bodies does not help since one arrives to the non compact group of matrices of unit determinant the difficulty in the gl n case arises when trying to construct an equivariant section of e g v as it was done above however the statement of the theorem probably still holds another question asked in 1 is the set of all similarity invariant points of the body clearly a convex set the convex hull of finitely many such points the answer to this question happens to be negative 3 remark during translation here compactness of g is used again 4 theorem 5 the set of all similarity invariant points of the body is not a convex hull of finitely many such points proof indeed let us construct a counterexample consider the coordinate plane x 1 0 in r n and a convex n 1 dimensional body k in it such that its only similarity automorphism is the identity let us now construct an n dimensional body k in such a way that it consists of 1 points x 1 y where 0 x 1 1 and y 1 x 1 k 2 points x 1 y where 0 x 1 1 and y 1 x 1 k 3 points 1 0 and 1 0 this is what is called in topology suspension over k it is clear now that the set of similarity invariant points of k contains intk and is contained in k as soon as k is not a polyhedron this is a counterexample the author expresses his gratitude to his adviser s g krein as well as to m g zaidenberg and a a pankov for discussions and comments references 1 branko gru nbaum
