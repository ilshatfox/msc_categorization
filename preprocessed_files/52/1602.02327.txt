convex shapes and harmonic caps laura demarco and kathryn lindsey abstract any planar shape p c can be embedded isometrically as part of the boundary surface s of a convex subset of r 3 such that p supports the positive curvature of s the complement q s p is the associated cap we study the cap construction when the curvature is harmonic measure on the boundary of c p of particular interest is the case when p is a filled polynomial julia set and the curvature is proportional to the measure of maximal entropy 1 introduction a planar shape is a compact connected subset of the euclidean plane that con tains at least two points and has connected complement given a probability measure supported on the boundary of a planar shape p we investigate the existence of a conformal metric z dz on the riemann sphere c so that i p with its euclidean metric from r 2 embeds locally isometrically into c and ii the curvature distribution log z on c is equal to the push forward of 4 under the embedding if exists then it is uniquely determined up to isometry c f 4 3 5 theorem 1 and we will denote it by p a d alexandrov s theorems on convex surfaces 3 2 4 assert that any abstract metrized sphere with non negative curvature is isometric to the boundary surface of a convex body in r 3 with its induced metric unique up to rigid motions of r 3 in particular the metrized sphere c p will have a unique convex 3 d realization the convex body may be degenerate meaning that it lies in a plane and the sphere is viewed as the double of a convex planar region conversely the surface of any compact convex body in r 3 not contained in a line may be endowed with a com plex structure and uniformized so that it is isometric to the riemann sphere with a conformal metric of non negative curvature see e g 24 thus the existence of p may be viewed as a problem of folding the shape p into r 3 and taking its convex hull in such a way that the curvature of the resulting convex body is given by 4 the complement of p in c p will be called the cap of p and denoted by p by construction the metric on the cap is flat so there is a locally isometric date december 2 2016 1 ar x iv 1 60 2 02 32 7 v 2 m at h d s 1 d ec 2 01 6 2 laura demarco and kathryn lindsey development map d p c dz we say the cap is planar if the development d is injective our first observation is that there always exists a probability measure supported on p so that the metric p exists see 2 1 for a simple but degenerate construc tion we also observe that not all caps are planar and we give examples in section 2 the harmonic cap we are especially interested in the case where p is a connected filled julia set k f of a polynomial f c c and the prescribed measure is the measure of maximal entropy supported on the boundary of k f see details in 2 4 this metrized sphere was defined in 13 section 12 for an arbitrary rational map f p 1 p 1 of degree 1 questions about the features of its 3 dimensional realization were first posed by c mcmullen and w thurston to this end we examine arbitrary planar shapes p c and we let be the harmonic measure for the domain c p relative to by definition is the push forward of the lebesgue measure on the unit circle s 1 normalized to have total mass 1 under a conformal isomorphism c d c p the measure is well defined even if is not everywhere defined on s 1 in this setting the metric p is simply an extension of the euclidean metric dz on p it can be expressed in terms of the green function gp z log 1 z for z c p setting gp z 0 for z p we have p e 2 gp z dz observe that the metric p is continuous on all of c gp is continuous on c by solvability of the dirichlet problem on simply connected domains and it grows as log z o 1 as z for some r the cap p is called the harmonic cap of p theorem 1 1 let p be any planar shape and let be the harmonic measure on p relative to let c d c p be a conformal isomorphism with a euclidean development of the harmonic cap p is given by the locally univalent function g d c defined by g z z 0 1 x dx moreover there exist planar shapes p for which the harmonic cap is not planar as an example the harmonic cap of a closed interval is planar its development is shown in figure 2 3 for p 2 2 where g z z z 3 3 a non planar example is described in 2 3 convex shapes and harmonic caps 3 theorem 1 1 allows one to appeal to the theory of univalent functions for conditions on p that guarantee planarity of the harmonic cap if the harmonic cap is planar then the construction can be iterated to find the harmonic cap of the development of a harmonic cap it would be interesting to understand the properties of this dynamical system on a class of planar shapes the closed unit disk is a fixed point of this operation see example 4 1 constructing a cap given the data of a conformal metric c with non negative curvature distribution it is a notoriously difficult problem to construct the 3 d real ization even for polyhedral metrics as we discuss below but it turns out that a development of a cap p in c can be easily produced on the computer for planar shapes that are jordan domains with rectifiable boundaries a cap p will have boundary of the same length as p a perimeter gluing of p and p is the boundary identification by arclength between p and p that produces c p theorem 1 2 let p be a planar shape with a piecewise differentiable jordan curve boundary and let be a nonnegative borel probability measure supported on the boundary of p let s be a counterclockwise unit speed parametrization of p and write s t t 0 ei x dx for a real valued function if the cap p exists then the boundary of its euclidean development is parameterized in the clockwise direction by s t t 0 ei x x dx where t 4 s 0 t and the perimeter gluing is given by s t s t given an arbitrary planar shape p we can approximate it by a shape p with piecewise differentiable jordan curve boundary and approximate any given measure on p with a probability measure supported on the boundary of p in this way theorem 1 2 supplies a straightforward strategy to illustrate the caps in practice we use polygonal approximations to the planar shape p with discrete curvature supported on the vertices see figures 1 1 and 1 2 a theorem of reshetnyak states that weak convergence of the curvature distributions as measures on c implies convergence of the metrics 24 theorem 7 3 1 23 for polygonal planar shapes with arbitrary probability measures supported on their vertices our cap drawing algorithm which follows the proof of theorem 1 2 can be used to draw the parametrization s independent of the existence of the metric extension p for many examples the curve s fails to form a closed loop or has a shape that cannot be the boundary parametrization of any euclidean development of a cap e g it may have positive winding number around a point in the plane while the boundary of a cap development traversed in the clockwise direction will wind non positively around all points for example if p is a triangle there is a unique measure supported on the vertices of p that gives rise to a cap any associated cap 4 laura demarco and kathryn lindsey figure 1 1 in blue a square in orange its harmonic cap with one attaching point indicated in black the perimeter gluing is by arclength there is a unique realization of the glued shapes as the boundary of a convex body in r 3 the harmonic measure on the boundary of the square was approximated by a discrete measure supported on 500 points using the riemann mapping function 5 in sage 14 image generated with mathe matica is necessarily a triangle whose sidelengths are the same as those of p implying the cap is a reflected copy of p the convex shape is degenerate and v 2 where v is a vertex of p with internal angle in general the questions of when the metric p exists and when the cap p is planar are quite delicate even in the polygonal setting problem 1 3 for polygons of n sides with side lengths 1 n and internal angle i at each of its vertices vi give an explicit description of the discrete curvature distributions i supported on the vertices vi so that the metric p exists provide conditions under which the polygonal cap p is planar problem 1 3 is related to the geometry of the space of polygons with fixed side lengths and no boundary crossings which to our knowledge has never been de scribed see 9 where it is proved that the space is connected and contractible the 3 dimensional realization recall by alexandrov s theorems 4 2 3 21 for nonnegative there is a unique way to fold the euclidean development of p and p to form the boundary surface of a convex shape in r 3 we may view the output of the cap drawing algorithm as in figures 1 1 and 1 2 as paper cut outs to be creased and glued to form the desired shape unfortunately the exact shape of the 3 dimensional realization is not at all clear from the development alone even the set of folding lines convex shapes and harmonic caps 5 figure 1 2 in blue a polygonal approximation to the filled julia set of f z z 2 1 with 211 vertices the preimages of z 2 0 under f 11 the discrete probability measure that assigns equal mass to each of its 211 vertices approximates the harmonic measure on the filled julia set in orange the polygonal cap associated to this polygon with discrete curvature measure there is a unique realization of the glued shapes as the boundary of a convex body in r 3 image generated with mathematica inside p and p is a mystery in general quoting from alexandrov in translation 4 p 100 to determine the structure of a polyhedron from a development i e to indicate its genuine edges in the development is a problem whose general solution seems hopeless but in the case of harmonic measure on a planar shape especially when the shape is the filled julia set of a polynomial there may be specialized ways to attack the problem not long ago bobenko and izmestiev devised an illuminating and constructive proof of alexandrov s realization theorem for polyhedral metrics 7 implementing their algorithm and making it publicly available unfortunately the algorithm was not practical for the polyhedra that closely approximate the metrics for polynomial julia sets 6 laurent bartholdi modified their strategy to handle some dynamical examples such as the filled julia set of f z z 2 1 shown in figure 1 3 formally the convex 3 d realization of c p determines a euclidean lamina tion on the interiors of p and p consisting of the geodesic line segments that must be folded to form the 3 d shape we call this the bending lamination of the pair p if one also retains the data of the dihedral angles the amount of the fold along each leaf of the lamination we obtain a measured lamination uniquely determined by the pair p we leave the following as an open problem problem 1 4 suppose is the harmonic measure relative to on the boundary of a planar shape p describe the measured bending lamination of p 6 laura demarco and kathryn lindsey figure 1 3 two views of bartholdi s polyhedral approximation to the 3 d realization of the filled julia set of f z z 2 1 with its harmonic measure computed with 211 vertices an illustration of the filled julia set is superimposed onto the image graphic created with glc player other comments and acknowledgments in the course of this project we were introduced to the vast literature of the computational geometry community quite a bit of research has gone towards visualizing the 3 d realizations of alexandrov s convex polyhedral metrics and related problems most notably we mention that we learned much from the work of demaine and o rourke and their co authors see e g 10 11 we would like to thank curt mcmullen and posthumously bill thurston for introducing us to this problem and for many interesting conversations on the topic over the past 15 years in particular the idea of representing a julia set and its cap as paper cut outs is due to thurston our perspective on caps and bending is also inspired by the theory of pleated surfaces and thurston s study of spaces of polyhedra 25 27 and the geometry of filled julia sets for homogeneous polynomial maps 18 we are grateful to laurent bartholdi ilia binder robert connelly david dumas and amie wilkinson for helpful discussions finally we thank the anonymous referee for many thoughtful useful suggestions our research was supported by the national science foundation and the simons foundation 2 caps spirals and julia sets in this section we observe that for every planar shape p there is a probability measure on its boundary so that the metric p on c exists by simple con structions in r 2 we provide examples to illustrate the failure of planarity of a cap we conclude the section with examples of harmonic caps coming from polynomial dynamical systems f c c formal definitions and the proofs of our theorems will be given in sections 3 and 4 2 1 the naive cap let p be a planar shape that is not contained in a line let p be the convex hull of p in the plane the naive cap p is the union of p and a copy of each connected component of p p the flaps glued along their boundaries convex shapes and harmonic caps 7 in p then p and p glue to determine a degenerate convex body and the metrized sphere is a doubled copy of p its curvature is supported in the intersection of p with p unfolding the flaps of the naive cap p determines a euclidean develop ment we can appeal to the uniformization theorem or to reshetnyak s theorem on isothermal coordinates 24 theorem 7 1 2 to conclude that this degenerate surface can be represented as a conformal metric on the riemann sphere c if p is an interval then we can produce a cap by bending p into an l shape in the plane introducing an angle at the midpoint of p and then taking the convex hull of this new shape in r 2 viewing the resulting triangle as a degenerate convex body in r 3 we produce a metrized sphere with 3 concentrated points of curvature at the two endpoints of p and at its midpoint as p p in this example we have shown the existence of a probability measure supported in p and giving rise to a metric p on c the developed cap p will be a rhombus for example if the angle is chosen to be 3 then the triangle will be equilateral and will assign equal mass to each of the three cone points 2 2 the naive cap is not always planar start with a convex polygonal shape in the plane with an external angle of about 16 at one vertex remove two very thin spiral channels from the polygon that begin on adjacent edges of the polygon and spiral around one another as in the left image of figure 2 1 if the spirals are sufficiently intertwined then the spiral flaps on the developed naive cap will overlap the right side of figure 2 1 shows the spirals reflected across the edges of the polygon figure 2 1 left a piece of a convex polygon lying above the red and green line segments minus two narrow spiral channels shown in orange and blue that begin from adjacent edges of the polygon each channel cut from the polygon is so narrow that we depict it as a curve right a piece of its naive cap again above the red and green segments with the two spiral flaps reflected outward illustrating a non planar euclidean development 2 3 non planar example for harmonic measure for the harmonic cap it is possible to construct an example similar to that of 2 2 indeed very skinny channels removed from any planar shape will have negligible harmonic measure and so we can arrange for overlapping spirals in the cap 8 laura demarco and kathryn lindsey figure 2 2 left two narrow spiral channels shown in orange and blue cut from the interior of a square planar shape a segment of which is shown in green each channel cut from the polygon is so narrow that we depict it as a curve right the two spirals on the exterior of the clover shaped harmonic cap of the square illustrating a non planar euclidean development a complete and accurate picture of the harmonic cap of the square is shown in figure 1 1 more precisely begin with a square planar shape and choose a tiny 0 the harmonic cap for the square is shown in figure 1 1 now remove two very skinny spiral channels from the square emanating from a single edge as in the left image of figure 2 2 the openings of each channel should have width smaller than the openings of the two spiral channels can be placed at a specified distance apart from one another so that the harmonic measure of the interval between them is approximately equal to 1 32 of the total mass the number 1 32 is chosen because it is 1 4 times the curvature of 8 for the polygon vertex shown in figure 2 1 we can choose 0 as small we wish so that the harmonic measure along the spiral boundaries is almost 0 indeed as the width of the spiral channels shrinks to 0 the domains c p are converging in the carathe odory sense to the complement of the square see e g 15 3 1 recall that the boundary of the cap development is parameterized by the formula of theorem 1 2 the parametrization of the spirals on the cap which will lie outside the clover like harmonic cap for the square will be essentially equal to a reflection of their original parametrizations because will be essentially constant along their boundaries having chosen the harmonic measure of the spirals to be near 0 on the other hand the non trivial portion of harmonic measure on the boundary of the square between the spiral channel openings will curve the boundary of the cap so the spirals overlap the change in tangent direction of the clover cap between the two attaching points of the spirals will be 8 by construction see figure 2 2 convex shapes and harmonic caps 9 2 4 polynomial julia sets now assume that f c c is a complex polynomial of degree d 2 its filled julia set is k f z c sup n fn z assume that k f is connected so it is a planar shape a planar development of its cap is given by the formula of theorem 1 1 we can parameterize the boundary of the cap s development for smooth or polygonal approximations to k f using theorem 1 2 the green function for k f can be computed dynamically as gf z lim n 1 dn log fn z the harmonic measure f 1 2 gf is the unique measure of maximal entropy for f and its support is equal to the julia set j f k f 8 20 17 the metric on c is defined by f e 2 gf z dz for z c with curvature distribution f log f z 4 f example 2 1 let f z z 2 then k f is the closed unit disk and gf z log z the measure f is the lebesgue measure on the circle by symmetry the harmonic cap is also a closed disk of radius 1 it follows that the convex realization in r 3 is a degenerate closed disk example 2 2 let f z z 2 2 then k f is the real interval 2 2 and the metric on the sphere and the euclidean development of the harmonic cap can be computed explicitly the riemann map from the complement of the unit disk to the complement of k f is given by f z z 1 z applying theorem 1 1 the cap is the image of the holomorphic function g d c defined by g z z 0 f 1 x dx z 0 1 z 2 dz z z 3 3 see figure 2 3 the convex realization in r 3 is degenerate example 2 3 let f z z 2 1 4 a polygonal approximation to its filled julia set and the harmonic cap are shown in figure 2 4 the convex realization in r 3 is nondegenerate indeed if the filled julia set were contained in a plane in r 3 then its convex hull would also lie in the surface and then the curvature could not be supported on all of j f 10 laura demarco and kathryn lindsey figure 2 3 a euclidean development of the cap for the real interval p 2 2 equipped with its harmonic measure the figure shown is the image of the unit circle under g z z z 3 3 so the cusps lie at z 2 3 to form the metrized sphere the cap is folded in half along the segment joining the cusp points and the interval p forms the seam the resulting convex body is degenerate see example 2 2 figure 2 4 in blue a polygonal approximation to the filled julia set of f z z 2 1 4 with 211 vertices the preimages of z 0 5 under f 11 the approximation to harmonic measure puts equal weight on each of the 211 vertices in orange the polygonal cap for this discrete curvature distribution a single attaching point is shown in black there is a unique realization of the glued shapes as the boundary of a convex body in r 3 image generated with mathematica 3 metrics and curvature in this section we formalize the notions of curvature and metric from the point of view of euclidean geometry and we prove theorem 1 2 in proposition 3 1 we present an asymptotic formula for curvature when the boundary of the planar shape is a smooth jordan curve in terms of the circumference of small circles convex shapes and harmonic caps 11 3 1 polyhedra and cone angles a convex polyhedron in r 3 is the intersection of finitely many closed halfspaces it is said to be degenerate if it lies in a plane when the polyhedron is non degenerate and bounded its boundary surface is topologically a sphere and the euclidean metric from r 3 induces an intrinsic path metric on the sphere if the polyhedron is degenerate and bounded but not contained in a line we will still view its boundary as a topological sphere doubling the planar polygon and gluing along the polygonal boundary abstractly a convex polyhedral metric on a 2 dimensional sphere is an intrinsic metric with non negative curvature concentrated at finitely many points in other words in a small neighborhood of all but finitely many points the surface is isometric to a region in r 2 in a neighborhood of each of the finitely many cone points the surface is isometric to the point of a cone the curvature of a cone point is equal to the angle deficit at the point that is if the circumference of any small circle of radius r centered at the cone point is equal to c r then the curvature is equal to 2 r c r r by the gauss bonnet formula the sum of the curvatures over all cone points on the sphere is equal to 4 in 4 a d alexandrov examines the geometry of convex polyhedra in detail he presents his proof from 3 that any abstract polyhedral metric on a sphere is isometric to the boundary of a possibly degenerate convex polyhedron furthermore the polyhedron in r 3 is unique up to euclidean isometries given a polyhedral metric on the sphere and a simply connected subset u of the sphere minus its cone points a euclidean development of u is a local isometry u r 2 suppose we are given the image i r 2 of a euclidean development of a full area simply connected subset u of the sphere then as a consequence of alexandrov s theorem the convex polyhedron in r 3 is uniquely determined by i and the gluing along its boundary that reconstructs the topological sphere in particular the planar development and the gluing information will uniquely determine the edges of the polyhedron and their dihedral angles in r 3 information that is not locally apparent 3 2 more general metrics of non negative curvature in 2 alexandrov presents the proof of a more general realization result see chapter 1 of 21 for a summary given any abstract intrinsic metric on the sphere of non negative curvature it is re alizable as the boundary of a possibly degenerate convex body in r 3 his argument relies on a convergence statement first approximating the metric by polyhedral met rics realizing the convex polyhedra and then showing that the polyhedra converge to the desired convex body in r 3 curvature is carefully treated by alexandrov it is defined by an additive set function as follows the curvature of a point is as for a polyhedron 2 minus the 12 laura demarco and kathryn lindsey cone angle of the point that is 3 2 1 x lim r 0 2 r c x r r where c x r is the circumference of the circle of radius r centered at the point x the curvature of a geodesic line segment will always be 0 the curvature of a small geodesic triangle is its internal angle surplus defined as the sum of the internal angles of the triangle minus the curvature of a more general region is computed by triangulation see 21 chapter 1 page 18 y g reshetnyak who was a student of alexandrov reformulated alexandrov s theory of metrics and curvature on a surface in complex analytic language expressing curvature as a finite borel measure 24 we exploit this useful point of view in section 4 3 3 parametrization of the cap suppose that a planar shape p is the closure of a jordan domain with a piecewise differentiable boundary fix a nonnegative borel measure on the boundary of p let l be the length of p let s be a piecewise differentiable parametrization by arclength of the boundary of p in the counterclockwise direction and write s t ei t for a piecewise continuous function 0 l r for t 0 l we define a curvature function 0 l 0 4 by 0 0 and 3 3 1 t 4 s 0 t for all t 0 l so that is monotone increasing with l 4 recall that theorem 1 2 asserts that if the cap p exists then its boundary can be parameterized in the clockwise direction by s t t 0 ei x x dx proof of theorem 1 2 suppose first that p is a polygon in the complex plane and is a discrete probability measure supported on the vertices of p denote the vertices of p by v 0 v 1 vn v 0 oriented counterclockwise and set j vj vj 1 to be the length of the j th edge we may assume for simplicity that v 0 0 and v 1 1 lies on the positive real axis let j be the internal angle of p at vertex vj so that n j 1 j 2 convex shapes and harmonic caps 13 and t k 1 j 1 j for k 1 j 1 j t k j 1 j for each k 1 n thus p is parameterized by s t t 0 ei x dx if p exists then it has a polygonal boundary with the same edge lengths as p we label its vertices in the clockwise direction by v 0 v 1 v n v 0 we may assume for simplicity that v 0 v 0 and v 1 v 1 the curvature condition implies that the internal angle j at vertex v j must satisfy 4 vj 2 j j therefore the clockwise parametrization s of p will satisfy s t ei t with t k 1 j 1 j for k 1 j 1 j t k j 1 j t k 1 j 1 4 vj for k 1 j 1 j t k j 1 j t t in other words the parametrization of the boundary of p is given in a clockwise orientation by s t t 0 ei x x dx if p is an arbitrary planar shape with piecewise differentiable boundary and if is any probability measure supported on the boundary of p then the pair p can be approximated by a sequence of polygons pn n so that the vertices of pn lie in p for all n and n is a discrete probability measure supported on the vertices of pn we may construct the polygons pn so that the arclength parametrizations sn of pn converge uniformly to s and that the angle functions n uniformly furthermore by choosing the vertices of pn carefully we may assume that for every 0 all atoms of mass at least for are vertices of pn and atoms of n for all n n 0 in this way we can also arrange that the curvature functions n converge uniformly to the curvature function these choices for pn n imply that the integrals t 0 ei n x n x dx t 0 ei x x dx as n for all t 0 p in other words if the cap p exists then the desired boundary parametrization will be uniformly approximated by the curves s n defined 14 laura demarco and kathryn lindsey by s n t t 0 ei n x n x dx note that the curves s n are not necessarily closed loops as the approximating polyg onal caps p n may not exist 3 4 circumference and curvature if the boundary of the planar domain p and the measure are smooth enough then the curvature of 3 2 satisfies the following relation as a consequence of theorem 1 2 proposition 3 1 let p be a planar shape with boundary parametrized by arclength by s 0 l p such that s is twice continuously differentiable and let be a probability measure on p which is absolutely continuous with respect to arclength with a continuous density function suppose the metric p exists for each x p let c x r denote the circumference of a circle in c p centered at x of radius r 0 then lim r 0 2 r c s t r r 2 t where s t dt on the interval 0 l it is interesting to compare the statement of proposition 3 1 to the formula 3 2 1 for the alexandrov curvature of a point x lim r 0 2 r c x r r and to the bertrand puiseux formula for the gaussian curvature when the metric on a surface is smooth x lim r 0 3 2 r c x r r 3 26 page 147 in our setting the curvature of the surface is supported on a 1 dimensional curve so the circumference discrepancy is proportional to r 2 we begin with a simple geometric lemma lemma 3 2 for real numbers r r 0 let a r r be the arclength of the inter section of a closed disk of radius r and a circle of radius r centered at a boundary point of the disk then lim r 0 r a r r r 2 1 r proof assume the center of the radius r circle is at the origin in r 2 and the disk of radius r is tangent to the x axis at the origin these two circles are given by the equations x 2 y r 2 r 2 and x 2 y 2 r 2 these two circles intersect in two convex shapes and harmonic caps 15 points r 2 r 4 4 r 2 r 2 2 r hence a r r r 2 tan 1 r 2 4 r 2 r 2 r 4 then lim r 0 r a r r r 2 lim r 0 2 tan 1 r 2 4 r 2 r 2 r 4 r 1 r proof of proposition 3 1 the curvature function of equation 3 3 1 is computed as t s 0 t t 0 x dx for each t 0 l and each small r 0 the circumference c s t r is the sum of the lengths of two circular arcs the arc in p to the left of s t relative to the counterclockwise orientation on p whose length we will denote by cr t and the arc in p to the right of s t relative to the clockwise orientation on p whose length we will denote by c r t classical plane geometry tells us that the radius of the osculating circle to the plane curve s at s t is 1 s t 1 t using the notation of theorem 1 2 likewise from theorem 1 2 the radius of the osculating circle to the plane curve s at s t equals 1 s t 1 t t for t 0 the osculating circle is to the left of s t so lim r 0 r cr t r 2 t t by lemma 3 2 for t 0 the osculating circle is to the right of s t so lim r 0 r cr t r 2 lim r 0 r 2 r a 1 t r r 2 t t by lemma 3 2 thus limr 0 r cr t r 2 t regardless of the sign of t similarly lim r 0 r c r t r 2 t t t t regardless of the sign of t t hence lim r 0 2 r c s t r r 2 lim r 0 r cr t r 2 lim r 0 r c r t r 2 t t t t 16 laura demarco and kathryn lindsey 4 harmonic measure and holomorphic 1 forms in this section we present curvature in the setting of conformal metrics allowing us to use tools from complex analysis to address our geometric questions this per spective was first formalized by reshetnyak 24 we present the proof of theorem 1 1 and derive an alternative proof of the parametrization of the harmonic cap from theorem 1 2 finally we revisit the general problem of existence of the metric p in proposition 4 2 4 1 complex analytic point of view a smooth conformal metric on a domain in c can be expressed as z dz for a smooth and positive function the metric has non negative curvature if u z log z is a subharmonic function working with a more general class of metrics we will only require that u be subharmonic not necessarily differentiable or everywhere finite we will also require that all pairs of points have finite distance from one another these requirements can be formulated in terms of the curvature of the metric as we explain below formally a conformal metric on c is a singular hermitian metric on the tangent bundle t c op 1 2 and the curvature form of the metric is the positive measure given in local coordinates by log with 2 i taken in the sense of distributions so that c 4 in more classical terms for a smooth metric the gaussian curvature is computed locally as log 2 see for example 1 1 5 or 19 2 2 that u log is subharmonic guarantees that the curvature form 0 as a distribution finite diameter is guaranteed by the assumption that z 0 2 for all z 0 c 24 p 100 recall from 3 4 that concentrated curvature at points z 0 c where 0 z 0 2 corresponds to cone points in the local geometry also in this setting a computation shows that the circumference c z 0 r of a small circle around z 0 of radius r 0 will satisfy 24 lemma 8 1 1 lim r 0 2 r c z 0 r r z 0 conversely every probability measure on c with z 1 2 for all z gives rise to a conformal metric of finite diameter with curvature distribution 4 unique up to scale indeed there is a one to one correspondence between probability measures convex shapes and harmonic caps 17 on c and their potentials up to an additive constant which can be viewed as logarithmically homogeneous plurisubharmonic functions g on the tautological line bundle c 2 0 0 p 1 see e g 16 theorem 5 9 and 13 section 12 the function g will satisfy 2 1 g z 1 in local coordinates z on c and the conformal metric is expressed as e 2 g z 1 dz the identification between measures and their potentials is continuous taking the l 1 loc topology on potentials and the weak topology on measures moreover convergence of curvatures implies convergence of the metrics 24 theorem 7 3 1 4 2 harmonic measure as curvature let p be a compact connected set in c containing at least 2 points so that p is a planar shape as defined in the introduction let gp c r be the green function for p it is the unique continuous function on c satisfying 1 gp 0 on p 2 gp z log z o 1 for z near and 3 gp is harmonic on c p then define a metric on c by p e 2 gp z dz by elementary potential theory the function gp satisfies gp z log z o 1 for z near for some real number so the metric extends uniquely by continuity across z note that this metric is flat with 0 curvature away from the boundary p its curvature form p 2 gp is equal to 4 times the harmonic measure on p more precisely the harmonic measure for the domain c p relative to the point example 4 1 let p be the closed unit disk thengp z log z max 0 log z and the curvature form p is arclength measure on the unit circle normalized to have total length 4 by the symmetry of p it is not hard to see that alexandrov s real ization of c p will be the degenerate doubled flat disk 4 3 the harmonic cap let p be any planar shape let be the riemann map from the complement of the unit disk to the complement of p sending infinity to infinity consider the holomorphic 1 form 1 1 z 2 dz on the complement of p since the green function satisfies gp z log 1 z on c p we see that is precisely the conformal metric p defined above when restricted to the complement of p recall that theorem 1 1 asserts that a euclidean 18 laura demarco and kathryn lindsey development of the harmonic cap of p is given by the locally univalent function g d c defined by g z z 0 1 x dx it also asserts that there exist examples where the locally univalent g fails to be univalent proof of theorem 1 1 define f c p c by f z z z 1 1 2 d by definition we have df f dw where dw is the standard holomorphic 1 form on the plane since is the desired conformal metric and since f dw we conclude that f is a euclidean development of the harmonic cap parametrized by z in c p now set x 1 x then to parameterize the cap by z d we pull back to d by so that d z z 0 z 0 2 d z 0 1 x dx the local invertibility of d is clear because d z 1 x 6 0 for all x d our desired function is g z d z which is clearly an isometric presentation it remains to observe that there exist planar shapes p for which the development g fails to be injective we constructed such an example in 2 3 where p is a square minus two thin spiral channels 4 4 harmonic cap boundary parametrization here we present an alternative proof of the cap parametrization in theorem 1 2 in the special setting of harmonic measure as in theorem 1 2 assume that p has a piecewise differentiable boundary which is a jordan curve parameterized by arclength by s 0 l c recall that s t ei t for some piecewise continuous function 0 l r let be a riemann map from the complement of the unit disk to the complement of p sending infinity to infinity then extends to a homeomorphism from the unit circle to the boundary of p define the conformal angle 0 l r by t arg 1 s t without loss of generality we may assume 0 0 so that defines a homeomor phism from 0 l to 0 2 it follows that the curvature function of 3 3 1 for the harmonic measure on p is equal to t 4 s 0 t 2 t convex shapes and harmonic caps 19 therefore from theorem 1 2 we know that the parametrization of the boundary of the harmonic cap is given by 4 4 1 s t t 0 ei x 2 x dx theorem 1 1 grants an alternate proof of 4 4 1 indeed with the g d c of theorem 1 1 a parametrization of the boundary of the harmonic cap is given by s t g 1 1 s t g e i t moreover the derivative of g is g z 1 z and therefore s t g 1 1 s t 1 s t s t 1 s t 2 1 s t 1 s t s t 1 s t 2 ei t 2 t 4 5 metric existence for general measures we conclude by returning to our original problem about the existence of a metric p for the case where p is a planar shape with jordan curve boundary and the probability measure is arbitrary suppose that j is a jordan curve in c cutting the sphere into jordan domains a and b we may assume that 0 a and b suppose that is a probability measure supported on j and let u z c log z w d w be a potential function for with logarithmic singularity at the conformal metric e 2 u z dz on c extends to c and has curvature distribution equal to 4 since a is simply connected there exists a non vanishing analytic function a c so that u z log z the function is determined uniquely up to postcomposition by a rotation set f z z 0 dz z 2 for z a then f a c is a locally univalent euclidean development of a into the plane it extends continuously to the boundary curve j this proves the following proposition proposition 4 2 let p be a planar shape with jordan curve boundary and let be a probability measure supported on p the metric p on c exists if and only if there is a pair j of a jordan curve bounding a region a in c and probability measure supported on j so that f a p and f 20 laura demarco and kathryn lindsey when is the harmonic measure on p observe that we may take j p and in the statement of proposition 4 2 indeed the potential function for harmonic measure satisfies u 0 on p so that f id references 1 lars v ahlfors conformal invariants topics in geometric function theory mcgraw hill book co new york du
