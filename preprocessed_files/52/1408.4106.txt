and shown that it admits a natural commutative multiplication although alesker s original construction is highly technical from a moral perspective this product is simply an ar tifact of the operation of intersection of two sets subsequently alesker and bernig gave an expression for the product in terms of differential forms we show how the alesker bernig formula arises naturally from the intersection interpretation and apply this insight to give a new formula for the product of a general valuation with a valuation that is expressed in terms of intersections with a sufficiently rich family of smooth polyhedra 1 introduction s alesker has introduced the space v m of smooth valuations on a smooth manifold m whose elements are finitely additive set functions de fined for sufficiently regular compact subsets of a smooth manifold further more v m carries a natural multiplicative structure for which the euler characteristic acts as the identity element these ideas provide a language that has transformed modern integral geometry cf 6 8 9 10 18 the basic idea behind the alesker product is very simple given a suffi ciently regular subset x m we may define the functional x by x a a x although this can only be defined for subsets a that meet x in a nice way it is clear that x is indeed finitely additive under this restriction thus x is not a smooth valuation but only a generalized valuation in the sense of 5 on the other hand a basic principle states that a smooth valuation may be approximated by linear combinations of valuations of this form if m is a finite dimensional real vector space and attention is restricted to the translation invariant elements of v m then this is a famous conjecture of p mcmullen proved by alesker in 1 if we now define 1 1 x y x y date april 17 2018 partially supported by nsf grant dms 1406252 1 http arxiv org abs 1408 4106 v 3 2 joseph h g fu or more generally 1 2 x a a x then the idea behind the procedure of 1 2 3 is to show that this product extends by linearity and continuity to all of v m following alesker we use the term smooth polyhedron to refer to a properly embedded smooth submanifold of m with corners by definition a smooth valuation is given in terms of a pair of differential forms living respec tively on m and on its cosphere bundle s m and assigns to any compact smooth polyhedron a m the sum of an interior term a and a boundary term n a here n a s m is the conormal cycle of a the mani fold of local supporting tangent hyperplanes for a alesker and bernig 5 distilled the definition of the alesker product of two smooth valuations into a formula involving only the differential forms underlying the factors and deduced the relation 1 1 however the technicalities thus introduced both in alesker s original approach and in the approach of alesker bernig are significant to the point where the basic simplicity of the construction of the product is obscured for example in the study 10 of kinematic formulas in complex space forms a rather obscure argument was needed to prove the following essentially simple fact recall that m g is called a riemannian isotropic space if m is riemannian and g is a lie group of isometries of m that acts transitively on the tangent sphere bundle denote by dg the haar measure of g theorem 1 1 10 theorem a 1 let m g be an isotropic space x a compact smooth polyhedron and c g then 1 3 a g a gx g dg defines a smooth valuation on m if v m then the alesker product of and is given by 1 4 a g a gx g dg results of this paper the main result of the present paper actually an immediate consequence of theorems 6 2 and 6 4 generalizes theorem 1 1 as follows we replace m by a general smooth oriented manifold g dg by a smooth oriented parameter manifold p equipped with a smooth signed volume form dp and the action of g onm by a smooth family of orientation preserving diffeomorphisms p p p ofm we assume that this apparatus is proper in a sense generalizing the usual notion of a proper group action and that the induced diffeomorphisms p of the cosphere bundle s m satisfy the condition that for any s m the map p s m given by p p is a submersion under these conditions we say that p dp is an admissible measured family of diffeopmorphisms of m generalizing the riemannian isotropic condition cf definition 6 1 1 below intersection theory and the alesker product 3 theorem 1 2 let p dp be an admissible measured family of diffeo morphisms of m and x m a compact smooth polyhedron then the set function 1 5 a p a p x dp defines a smooth valuation on m given another valuation v m we have 1 6 a p a p x dp a smooth valuation of the form 1 5 will be called a principal kine matic valuation the proof is accomplished by assigning a geometric meaning to each of the four terms that arise in the alesker bernig formula in case one of the factors has the form 1 5 one is a straightforward interior term the other three arise from a natural decomposition into three pieces of the normal cycle n a x of the intersection of two smooth polyhedra a x in general position the piece of n a lying above the interior of x the piece of n x lying above the interior of a and a piece that lies above the intersection of the boundaries of a x obtained by interpolating the family of arcs between the respective outward normals to a x this is accomplished in theorems 6 2 and 6 3 this decomposition is central to classical integral geometry e g in the classical proof of the kinematic formula given in 26 iii 15 4 concluding introductory remarks a major component of our motive here is foundational and pedagogical by analogy with the mcmullen con jecture it is conceivable that every smooth valuation is a principal kinematic valuation or at any rate that the principal kinematic valuations are dense in v m in a sense strong enough to imply that the product of two smooth valuations may be regarded as the limit of the products of sequences of approximating kinematic valuations this is true of invariant valuations in an isotropic space cf 10 corollary 2 18 if and when these statements are established it will be possible to view the alesker bernig formula which may even now be taken as the definition of the alesker product as a direct consequence of our intersection formulas this would offer a number of ex pository advantages for instance the commutativity of the product would then be a direct consequence of fubini s theorem as a final remark a significant issue in the theory of valuations is the question of exactly how regular a compact subset a m must be in order to possess a conormal cycle and thereby to be amenable to pairing with a smooth valuation for example it is known that semiconvex or subanalytic sets enjoy this regularity but it is also clear that a much wider and unfath omed range is possible cf e g 24 by the same token the subset x used in the construction of the kinematic valuation may in principle be selected from this range at the cost of introducing more sophisticated technology all of the main results in the present paper extend to the framework of 17 4 joseph h g fu which includes the cases where x a are semiconvex or even wdc in the sense of 24 and 19 we intend to explain this point more fully elsewhere the point of the present paper is to work entirely within the more familiar framework of the c category for the sake of greater accessibilty thus our hope is that the discussion will be comprehensible to any reader with a thor ough grounding in the basic constructions of differential geometry because of this we have omitted or only sketched a number of proofs that appear to us to be straightforward from that perspective 1 1 acknowledgements it is a pleasure to thank the institut fu r diskrete mathematik und geometrie at the technische universita t of vienna for their kind hospitality as the technical outline of this paper was sketched i would also like to thank t wannerer for helpful conversations as well as a bernig and g solanes for the collaborative project 10 that made the urgency of this project felt thanks are due to s alesker a bernig d faifman f schuster and g zhang for their helpful comments on an earlier version of this paper 2 currents and differential forms we collect a few well known facts and fix notation and conventions throughout this paper m will denote an oriented smooth manifold of di mension n the orientation is not strictly necessary in order to develop the theory of smooth valuations but it definitely simplifies the discussion 2 1 forms currents pre images intersections fiber integration formally our entire discussion revolves around the duality between currents and differential forms we devote extra care to determining the signs of intersections 2 1 1 denote by k m the space of smooth differential forms of degree k on m and by kc m the subspace of compactly supported forms a current of dimension k on m is a linear functional kc m r that is continuous with respect to c convergence with uniformly compact sup port we denote the pairing of a current t with a differential form by t indeed we will adopt the same notation for the pairing of any vector and covector a properly embedded smooth oriented submanifold x of di mension k determines a current of dimension k by x following the convention of 13 any n k m determines a current t of dimension k by t m a current of this form is called smooth and is the associated differential form to t 2 1 2 given smooth oriented submanifolds xn k y n m mn that inter sect transversely we denote by x y their oriented intersection the con vention determining the orientation is as follows equivalent to that of 21 chapter 3 2 given x x y let v 1 vm u 1 un k m w 1 wk be a basis for txm such that the vi uj txx the uj tx x y and the intersection theory and the alesker product 5 uj wl txy then the orientation of x y is determined by the con dition that the product of the orientations of these four ordered bases is 1 if m k n i e the intersection is zero dimensional then this same convention defines the multiplicity of the intersection in this case we put x y x y 1 for the sum of these multiplicities at the various points of intersection provided they are finite in number a straightforward cal culation reveals that 2 1 x y 1 mk y x in the obvious sense the symbol will be reserved for set theoretic intersection 2 1 3 fiber integration and slicing suppose m m are smooth oriented manifolds of dimensions n n m respectively and m m a smooth submersion if l m and supp is proper then there is a well defined fiber integral l m m characterized uniquely by the condition 2 2 m m for n m lc m this agrees with the convention 2 2 of 5 by ehresmann s fibration theorem the fibers fx 1 x may be ori ented so that m is locally identified with the oriented product m fx in the neighborhood of fx m if x m is a smooth oriented submanifold then its preimage 1 x m is then oriented so as to agree locally with the oriented products x fx thus 1 m m as oriented manifolds this orientation convention also entails the following lemma about slic ing lemma 2 1 let m m be a smooth proper map and n m the subset of critical values of i e the set of points where the derivative of has rank less than n then n has measure zero in m and m 1 n is open if n m is a smooth differential form of top degree and c m then for any properly embedded oriented smooth submanifold y m of dimension n 2 3 y m p y 1 p proof the first assertion is sard s theorem the second follows from the properness of and the fact that the set c m of critical points is closed to prove 2 3 we may apply the first paragraph with m replaced by y and replaced by its restriction to y put n for the set of critical values of y then 2 3 holds ifm is replaced bym n and y by y 1 n this 6 joseph h g fu follows from the implicit function theorem and the orientation convention above for preimages put c y for the set of critical points of y then 1 n 1 n c c where the first integral vanishes by the sard s theorem and the implicit function theorem and the integrand of the second integral vanishes identi cally 2 1 4 under these conventions one may easily check the following proper ties by restricting to the case that m is a product m f lemma 2 2 1 if x m y m are smooth oriented submanifolds and the restric tion of to y is a diffeomorphism such that x y meet trans versely then 2 4 y 1 x y x 2 if x z m are oriented submanifolds intersecting transversely then 2 5 1 x z 1 x 1 z 3 if lc m and dimx l m then 2 6 x 1 x 4 the current defined by integration over x may be approximated weakly by a sequence of currents defined by differential forms 1 2 with supports converging in the hausdorff metric topology to x the current defined by integration over 1 x is then the weak limit of the sequence of currents defined by the differential forms 1 2 with supports converging to 1 x 5 given another oriented manifold m and a second submersion m m we have the identity of oriented manifolds 2 7 1 1 x 1 x the last statement follows from the approximation property above and the corresponding fact about differential forms 2 2 smoothing a current by a family of diffeomorphisms we now describe a procedure for smoothing a current given by integration over a submanifold that will be central to the rest of the paper lemma 2 3 let p be an oriented smooth manifold equipped with a smooth signed volume form dp and p m m a smooth map such that each p p is a diffeomorphism for each x m the map x x is a submersion the restriction to suppdp m of the map p x p x x is proper intersection theory and the alesker product 7 suppose m m is a submersion from a second smooth oriented man ifold m with dimm n fix a properly embedded oriented smooth sub manifold x m of codimension k then 1 the linear functional p p x dp is a well defined smooth current on m of dimension n k put k m for the associated differential form 2 let y m be a compact smooth oriented submanifold of codimen sion m then y intersects 1 p x transversely for a e p p if n m k m then 2 8 y p y 1 p x dp in particular taking m m and to be the identity map 2 9 y p y p x dp if dimy n m k more generally 2 10 y p y p x dp proof 1 this is a special case of the following more general fact if t is a current of dimension n k on m then t p p t dp given by t p t p dp is smooth to prove this note first that using a partition of unity we may assume that m rn and recall the fundamental fact that if k c rn r n such that the restriction to suppk of the projection to the first factor is proper then for any distribution h on rn the function x h y k x y is smooth thinking of t as a differential form with distributional coeffi cients h 1 follows directly since the coefficients of t may be expressed as a sum of functions of this type corresponding to kernels k obtained via the coarea formula from dp and the derivatives of 2 the first assertion follows at once from theorem 6 35 of 22 let 1 2 m m be smooth differential forms whose associated currents converge weakly to y the left hand side of 2 8 is then the limit of the expressions 8 joseph h g fu m i 1 mk m i 1 mk m i 1 mk p p x i dp 1 mk p 1 p x i dp the submersivity condition on implies that l x y p x m p y p x is a smooth manifold and that the projections l m l p are smooth submersions clearly each 1 p 1 p x we orient l so that the orientations agree with that induced by that of x on the other hand by lemma 2 1 and 2 1 p 1 p x i dp p 1 p i dp l dp i 1 mdimp l i dp 1 mdimp 1 y dp 1 mdimp p 1 y 1 p p 1 p 1 y p 1 p x y 1 mk p y 1 p x as i 3 smooth polyhedra and conormal cycles 3 1 the cotangent and cosphere bundles we denote by s m the cosphere bundle of m which we may regard either as the space of oriented tangent hyperplanes to m or else as the quotient of the deleted cotangent bundle t m zero section under the equivalence relation t for t 0 given 0 t m we denote its image in s m by or proj the projections of t m and s m to m will be denoted by for convenience only we will sometimes impose an arbitrarily chosen riemannian metric on m in which case s m may be identified with the tangent sphere or cotangent sphere bundle of m intersection theory and the alesker product 9 3 1 1 the cotangent bundle t m is canonically oriented on the other hand there are several distinct natural ways to orient s m we will fix the orientation that agrees with the orientations coming from the local product structure rn sn 1 note that this is 1 n times the orientation as the boundary of the submanifold of t m consisting of all covectors of length 1 with respect to some riemannian metric recall that this orientation is determined by the condition that the sign of an ordered basis v 1 v 2 n 1 for t s m agrees with that of the ordered basis r v 1 v 2 n 1 for t t m where r is the euler vector field the fibers of the projectivization map proj t m zero section s m may be identified with 0 via the associated length function under the orientation convention of section 2 1 the orientations of these fibers are 1 n 1 times the canonical orientation of 0 3 1 2 a diffeomorphism m m induces a canonical symplectomor phism 1 t m t m homogeneous on fibers via pullback and thereby a contactomorphism s m s m that intertwines and the projection s m m 3 1 3 if sxm and then there is a well defined segment sxm joining to defined as the set of all cos t sin t t 0 2 for some arbitrarily chosen representatives with under the identifications induced by a riemannian metric as above we may think of as the minimizing geodesic from to in the co tangent sphere 3 1 4 for convenience we choose a contact form 1 s m selecting a smooth global section of the ray bundle t m zero section s m we put for s m the choice of determines a unique reeb vector field t on s m via the conditions t 1 lt 0 twd 0 where l denotes the lie derivative if s m then 3 1 tw tw it follows that is a multiple of iff 0 such a form is sometimes said to be vertical with respect to the contact structure observe that if n m then is vertical in this sense 3 2 smooth polyhedra and conormal cycles definition 3 1 a smooth polyhedron in m is a properly embedded smooth submanifold with corners i e a closed subset a m such that each x 0 a admits a neighborhood u m and smooth functions f 1 fl gl 1 gk c u 0 l k n such that 10 joseph h g fu f 1 x 0 gk x 0 0 dx 0 f 1 dx 0 gk are linearly independent a u li 1 f 1 i 0 kj l 1 g 1 j 0 denote by an k the set of points x 0 with these properties we denote the class of all such objects by p p m and the subclass of compact smooth polyhedra by pc pc m equivalently a is a smooth polyhedron if for each x 0 there is such u such that the pair u u a is diffeomorphic to rn 0 l rn k l 0 i e to an orthant possibly with positive codimension within rn clearly any a p admits a natural stratification a nl 0 al with the al defined as above observe that an is the interior of a and that each al is a smooth locally closed submanifold of m of dimension l any a p is semiconvex i e its image in rn under any local coordinate chart has locally positive reach in the sense of 14 the following slightly adapted notions from 14 therefore apply but in simplified form due to the additional smoothness of the sets we are considering given x a the tangent cone to a at x is the closed convex cone tanxa consisting of all 0 where 0 a is a smooth curve with 0 x the conormal cone to a at x is the convex cone norxa dual to tanxa i e norx a t xm v 0 for all v tanxa and put nor a x norx a t m put also nx a 0 norx a s m n a x nx a s m thus nx a when x lies in the interior of a it is clear that if m m is a diffeomorphism then 1 map nor a n a bijectively to nor a n a respectively the set nor a is a piecewise smooth conic lagrangian submanifold of t m comprised of smooth submanifolds with corners with pairwise dis joint interiors of the conormal bundles nor ak of the strata ak of a this is clear if a is an orthant in m rn hence true for general smooth polyhe dra a by diffeomorphism invariance a point nor a belonging to one of these interiors is called a smooth point of nor a selecting an aux iliary riemannian metric the exponential map induces a piecewise smooth homeomorphism of the submanifold of all elements of nor a of sufficiently small length to a tubular neighborhood of a in m we endow nor a with the orientation thus induced by that of m likewise n a is a compact piecewise smooth legendrian submanifold without boundary of s m i e the contact form vanishes identically on all intersection theory and the alesker product 11 tangent spaces ofn a and decomposes as a union of smooth submanifolds with corners of the n ak with disjoint interiors we orient n a via its identification with the boundary of the domain in nor a consisting of of covectors of length 1 with respect to some riemannian metric thus under the equivalence induced by the exponential map above the conormal cycle n a may be identified with the image of the boundary of the tubular neighborhood oriented accordingly we observe lemma 3 2 the orientation of n a agrees with the orientations of each n ak defined in the same manner where they overlap we have the equal ity of oriented submanifolds 3 2 nor a zero section proj 1 n a proof the first assertion is immediate from the identification above of the normal cycle with the boundary of a tubular neighborhood to prove the second assertion identifying s m with a submanifold of t m with the aid of a riemannian metric the diffeomorphism r r is an orientation preserving diffeomorphism 0 n a nor a zero section where 0 is oriented in the standard way thus the map r r maps n a 0 nor a zero section with orientation 1 n 1 by 2 1 3 and 3 1 1 this yields 3 2 definition 3 3 we say that a b p m intersect transversely if the strata of a b intersect pairwise transversely lemma 3 4 if a b p m intersect transversely then a b p m in this case for all x a b 3 3 norx a b norx a norx b minkowski sum and nx a b is the union of all segments for nx a nx b the interiors of these segments are pairwise disjoint proof the first statement is clear from the definition of smooth polyhedra the relation 3 3 is a straightforward adaptation of 14 theorem 4 10 3 this statement translates directly to give the second assertion since by transversality nor a nor b zero section the final assertion is clear 3 3 morse theory via intersections let f be a morse function on m i e f c m and the graph of df meets the zero section transversely in t m let a pc m put s s m s m s for the fiberwise antipodal map we will say that f is morse on a if the graph t m of df intersects s nor a only in smooth points and every such intersection is transverse this implies in particular that no critical points of f lie on the boundary of a we orient so that its projection to m is orientation preserving 12 joseph h g fu it is elementary cf e g 21 that the ordinary morse condition on f is equivalent to the transversality of t m and the zero section and that the multiplicity of the intersection at a point x m is 1 f x where f x is the morse index of f at x morse theory thus implies that if f is proper bounded below and admits only finitely many critical points then zero section m the next lemma adapts this identity to a function that is morse on a pc m lemma 3 5 if f is morse on a then a s nor a more generally if s nor a 1 f 1 t i e t is a regular value of f a then a f 1 t s nor a 1 f 1 t 1 n 1 f 1 t s nor a proof this may be proved using either the elementary approach of 15 or the more sophisticated and general theory of 20 we express this fact in terms of the cosphere bundle s m put s m for the image of zero section under projectivization lemma 3 6 if f is morse on a pc then the set of critical points of f a is finite and for every regular value t of f a a f 1 t 1 n 1 f 1 t s n a x a dxf 0 f x t 1 f x proof this follows at once from 2 4 and lemma 3 2 observe that the intersection product that occurs in lemma 3 6 is com mutative since the dimensions of the factors are n 1 and n respectively i e one of them is even 4 smooth valuations following 4 5 a smooth valuation onm is a set function pc m r that is expressible as 4 1 a n a a for some smooth differential forms n 1 m n s m we denote by v m the vector space of all smooth valuations on m the classic works 11 12 imply that the euler characteristic v m intersection theory and the alesker product 13 a related notion is that of a smooth curvature measure onm defined as follows putm m for the space of all signed radon measures on m a curvature measure on m is a set function p m m m given by 4 2 a e a e n a 1 e a e alternatively we may think of such as a map c m v m associ ating to a smooth function f the smooth valuation 4 3 f a a f n a f a f we denote by c m the vector space of all smooth curvature measures on m clearly there are surjective linear maps 4 4 n 1 s m n m c m v m we put 4 5 c m v m for the respective images of under the first map and the composition of the two maps a smooth valuation v m is finitely additive in the sense that if a b a b a b pc m then a b a b a b this follows from the corresponding relation among the normal cycles n a b n a n b n a b we will not make use of this relation except to argue that since a smooth polyhedron may be decomposed as finely as desired a smooth valuation is determined by its values on subsets of small open sets in m 4 1 the variation and the point function of a smooth valuation there are canonical maps f v m c m v m n s m determined by the relations f x x 4 6 0 4 7 d dt ft a n a vw 4 8 for any a pc m and any smooth vector field v on m where ft is the flow of v note that we have abused notation in the integrand on the right hand side formally we should replace v by a lift of v to s m and observe that since is a multiple of the contact form and n a is legendrian the value of the integral is independent of choices 14 joseph h g fu proposition 4 1 1 the maps f are uniquely determined by the properties 4 6 4 7 4 8 2 if f 0 then 0 3 if then f 4 9 d 4 10 where d denotes the rumin differential 25 remarks 1 assertions 2 and 3 encompass the kernel theorem of bernig and bro cker 7 and may be proved as follows by finite additivity it is enough to show that a 0 in the case where m is a convex open set u rn containing 0 and a u is convex if 0 then taking v to be the euler vector field we find that ta a for a pc u and 0 t 1 on the other hand in terms of weak convergence of currents n ta n 0 as t 0 so that a f 0 2 the map f is surjective given f c m and representing the euler characteristic as clearly f f f furthermore by 25 and 4 10 the image of consists precisely of the n forms of the form n m n s m where is exact and 0 since the long exact gysin sequence cf e g 23 for the cosphere bundle includes the segment hn m hn s m h 1 m it follows that this image may also be characterized as the space of such for which is closed 0 and 1 m is exact one may interpret this last condition from the valuation theoretic perspective as follows given such we wish to construct v m with since 0 we may omit the first term by finite additivity it is enough to give the value a in the case where a is contractible replacing by in the variation formula and contracting a to a point as above we see that is well defined if it is well defined on singletons i e iff f is well defined or in other words if given two smooth paths 1 2 joining arbitrarily chosen points x y m there exist respective local primitives i for along i such that 1 x 1 y 2 x 2 y by stokes theorem this is equivalent to the vanishing of on the 1 cycle 1 2 3 the relation 4 10 implies that is closed it would be desirable to have a valuation theoretic proof of this fact similar to the argument above along the following incomplete lines let a b pc m and let v w be vector fields with flows f g respectively such that f 1 a g 1 a b define the n chains intersection theory and the alesker product 15 f f n a 0 1 g g n a 0 1 s m then by 4 8 and the coarea formula f 1 0 n ft a vw dt b a g a homotopy between f g then determines an n 1 chain h with h f g so that by stokes theorem h d f g 0 4 as a side point we recall that rumin 25 showed that every degree n cohomology class of any 2 n 1 dimensional contact manifold contains a representative belonging to the contact ideal 5 the main construction the main theater is the oriented smooth 3 n 1 dimensional manifold 5 1 s m 3 where denotes the open segment in s m joining thus there are three associated projections s m we view as the total space of a bundle over m with fiber fx over x m diffeomorphic to sxm 0 2 sxm with the diagonal and antidiagonal deleted via the map 5 2 t cos t sin t where t xm zero section are arbitrarily chosen representatives of giving rise to an open embedding s m 0 2 m s m canonical up to orientation preserving reparametrizations of 0 2 follow ing our usual practice we orient in terms of the local product structure r n sn 1 0 2 sn 1 5 1 a completion of in the constructions of theorems 5 2 and 6 2 below we will perform a number of fiber integrals with respect to the nat ural projections on the face of it these fiber integrals are prob lematic since these maps are not proper however this obstacle may be circumvented by working implicitly over a convenient completion with the following properties 16 joseph h g fu 1 is a smooth oriented manifold with corners equipped with a smooth proper map s m m s m m s m s m 3 2 the restriction of to the interior of yields a diffeomorphism with 3 each of the maps is the projection of a smooth fiber bundle over s m with fiber equal to a smooth oriented compact manifold with corners 4 the map s m m s m is the projection of a smooth fiber bundle with fiber given by a smooth compact oriented manifold with corners we construct as the cartesian product s 0 1 where s is the oriented blowup of s m m s m over the union of the diagonal and the antidiago nal introducing for convenience an auxiliary riemannian metric s may be realized as a fiber bundle over m with fiber over x equal to u sxm 0 where u sxm 0 sxm sxm is the unit tangent bun dle of the unit cotangent sphere sxm the map s m m s m of 4 is then realized fiberwise by t cos t sin t sxm sxm the maps are the compositions of this map with the projections to the first and second factors respectively the map is then t r cos r t sin rt sxm r 0 1 the blowdown map is obtained by assembling the three maps just de scribed 5 2 the normal cycle of a transverse intersection the geometric meaning of lies in the following lemma 5 1 if a b p m intersect transversely then 1 n a and 1 n b intersect transversely as submanifolds of the restriction of to the intersection yields a diffeomorphism 1 n a 1 n b n a b n a 1 b n b 1 a of parity 1 n proof recall that the transversality of a b means precisely that the various strata of a b meet pairwise transversely thus by lemma 3 2 the present assertion follows from the special case in which a b are properly embedded submanifolds viz strata that intersect transversely by diffeomorphism invariance we may even assume that m rn endowed with the standard euclidean metric and that a rk 0 rm b rk rl 0 k l m n are transverse coordinate planes intersection theory and the alesker product 17 denote by s sa s sb s the spheres of rn 0 rl 0 0 0 rm respectively with their standard orientations thus we have the equalities of oriented manifolds sr n rn s rn s 0 2 s n a 1 k l 1 m rk 0 rm sa n b 1 k l rk rl 0 sb here the numerical factors signify corresponding changes of orientation in duced by the requirement stated in the paragraph preceding lemma 3 2 that the map p q p q restricted to the normal cycle of x gives an orientation preserving diffeomorphism to the boundary of a tubular neigh borhood of x here we also take into account the fundamental relation c d c d 1 dimcc d then 1 n a 1 k l 1 m rk 0 rm sa 0 2 s 1 n b 1 k l n m 1 rk rl 0 s 0 2 sb as

simpler calculation that takes place in the full cotangent bundle replacing s m by t m n by nor and rn sn 1 0 2 sn 1 srn by the map r n r n r n r n r n x v w x v w lemma 5 1 then follows from a functoriality argument using lemma 3 2 although this approach is in some ways more convincing we have opted for the present approach since the functoriality construction seems a bit too fancy here 5 3 the alesker bernig formula alesker bernig 5 showed that the product of valuations may be expressed in terms of their underlying differ ential forms as in theorem 5 2 below for our purposes we may take their formula given below as the definition of the product of a valuation and a curvature measure theorem 5 2 alesker bernig 5 theorem 2 let v m n 1 s m n m then 5 5 where s f 5 6 s f 5 7 remarks replacing the forms by their multiples by smooth func tions f 5 5 is equivalent to the same formula with the curvature measures replaced by valuations the key term here is the first summand on the right hand side of 5 6 formally this expression differs from that of the original source 5 in two respects there the antipodal map s is not involved and our space consist ing of all such that lies on the segment joining to is replaced there by the manifold of all such triples such that lies on the segment joining to thus the two discrepancies cancel each other since satisfy the first condition iff s satisfy the second intersection theory and the alesker product 19 another cosmetic difference between our formulas and those of 5 is the presence of the term in the second factor of the first term of 5 6 it is easy to see that 0 for dimensional reasons 6 kinematic valuations we arrive finally at the main construction of this paper definition 6 1 let m be a smooth oriented manifold 1 an admissible measured family of diffeomorphisms of m is a triple p dp where p is a smooth oriented manifold p m m is a smooth map such that each p p is an orientation preserving diffeomorphism of m the restriction to suppdp m of the map p x p x x is proper put p s m s m for the induced family of contact diffeomorphisms of the cosphere bundle then for each s m the map p p is a submersion 2 a kinematic valuation on a smooth oriented manifold m is a set function x p dp determined by the following data a smooth valuation v m a compact smooth polyhedron x pc m an admissible measured family p dp of diffeomorphisms of m we then put 6 1 a p a p x dp 3 if then is a principal kinematic valuation it is clear that if m g is riemannian isotropic in the sense described in the introduction and dg is haar measure on g then m dg g is an admissible measured family of diffeomorphisms of m 6 1 kinematic valuations are smooth a priori it is not clear under what conditions a is well defined we show now that this is the case whenever a pc m and that is in fact given by an element of v m in this case to prove this we express explicitly as using the con structions above observe first that by lemma 2 3 the n 1 dimensional current p p n x dp p n p x dp is smooth let n s m denote the associated differential form since n x is closed and legendrian it follows that d 0 20 joseph h g fu define also f c m by f x dp p p x p x theorem 6 2 let p dp be an admissible measured family of diffeo morphisms of m and x m a compact smooth polyhedron then 1 if a pc m then a and p x intersect transversely for a e p p 2 the integral on the right hand side of 6 1 converges absolutely 3 the resulting set function is a smooth valuation more precisely if then where 1 n f 6 2 f 6 3 with f defined as above proof conclusion 1 follows at once from conclusion 2 of lemma 2 3 2 ifa and p x intersect transversely then clearly n a n p x n a sn p x thus we may write n a p x as the disjoint union of the three pieces n a 1 p x n p x 1 a n a p x 1 a 1 p x and accordingly a p a p x dp p n a p x a p x dp p n a p x 1 a 1 p x dp p n a 1 p x dp 6 4 p n p x 1 a dp p a p x dp it is clear that the second third and fourth of these integrals are all absolutely convergent it remains to show that the same is true of the first recalling the construction of the space from section 5 1 consider the map 1 p p s m s m by condition 4 of section 5 1 the submersivity condition on implies that is again a submersion and that the same is true of its restriction to the strata of the manifold with corners p in particular each such restriction is transverse to n a n x it follows that the preimage of n a n x is again a smooth properly embedded submanifold with corners of p by the properness condition on the intersection of this submanifold with corners with the support of dp is compact by lemma 5 1 the term in question is the integral over this set of a continuous object viz the product of the pullbacks of the differential form and the density dp thus the conclusion follows 3 we show that the four terms of 6 4 equal respectively the four terms in 6 2 6 3 intersection theory and the alesker product 21 the second and fourth of these equalities i e n a f p n a 1 p x dp a f p p x a dp follow at once from the fubini tonelli theorem the third identity follows from 2 10 with replaced by s m y by 1 a s m x by n x and by for the first identity by lemma 5 1 the domains of integration of the inner integrals are n a p x 1 a 1 p x 1 n 1 n a 1 pn x thus by 2 8 and 2 6 the term in question becomes 1 n p 1 n a 1 pn x dp 1 n 1 n a 1 n n a as claimed 6 2 an alternative characterization of principal kinematic valua tions now assume that and define f as above following sec tion 4 1 the resulting principal kinematic valuation may be characterized in terms of its variation and point function as follows theorem 6 3 the smooth valuation x p dp is characterized by the relations 1 ns f f proof the second relation is immediate to prove the first it is enough to show that if v is a smooth vector field with flow ft and a pc m then 6 5 d dt t 0 ft a 1 n n a vw s in fact it is enough to prove this in the case where a is a smooth compact domain and v is outward pointing along the boundary of a given such a any smooth vector field may be expressed as a difference of vector fields with this property in this case there exists a morse function g c m and 0 such that ft a g 1 t whenever t and all such t are regular values of g let v denote a lift of v to s m that is tangent to the graph of dg within the open set 1 g 1 using lemma 2 2 1 we deduce that 1 g 1 t n g 1 t 22 joseph h g fu thus if a b then by the coarea formula 6 6 1 g 1 a b b a n g 1 t v w dt for any n s m thus by lemma 3 6 lemma 2 3 2 9 and 6 6 d dt t 0 g 1 0 t lim t 0 t 1 g 1 t g 1 0 lim t 0 t 1 p p x g 1 t p x g 1 0 dp 1 n lim t 0 t 1 p 1 g 1 0 t sn p x dp 1 n lim t 0 t 1 1 g 1 0 t s 1 n n g 1 0 v w s the desired identity now follows from conclusion 1 of proposition 4 1 6 3 the main theorem let us fix the data x p dp and abbreviate x p dp for v m theorem 6 4 given any c m the alesker product is given by 6 7 a u p a p x u p x dp for any a p m and u m relatively compact and borel proof as in the remark following theorem 5 2 it is enough to prove the corresponding statement with the curvature measure replaced by a smooth valuation from theorems 5 2 6 2 and 6 3 it follows that and therefore as claimed references 1 alesker s description of translation invariant valuations on convex sets with solu tion of p mcmullen s conjecture geom
