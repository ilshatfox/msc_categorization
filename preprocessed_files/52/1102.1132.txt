polytopes including the regular and semi regular polytopes as special cases an infinite number of rank 2 coxeter groups which are isomorphic to the dihedral groups exist in 2 d dimensions describing the symmetries of the vertex and edge transitive polygons in 3 d besides the prismatic groups isomorphic to nd 2 cdn there exist three rank 3 coxeter groups and describing the symmetries of the tetrahedron octahedron cube and icosahedron dodecahedron and their archimedean polyhedra extension of the rank 3 coxeter groups to rank 4 coxeter groups is somewhat straightforward they are the coxeter groups and with an exception the group there exist six platonic solids which are respectively 5 cell a generalization of tetrahedron hyperoctahedron hypercube 600 cell 120 cell a generalization of icosahedron dodecahedron to 4 d and 24 cell respectively which have no correspondence in 3 d in the higher dimensional euclidean spaces with there exist no correspondences to the groups and but the generalizations of the tetrahedral and octahedral symmetries to higher dimensions are represented by the coxeter groups and with respectively which describe the and the hyperoctahedron hypercube 1 3 aw fw nbw 3 bw 4 3 hw 4 hw 5 4 aw 4 fw 4 bw 4 hw 5 d cell 1 n naw n the rank 4 coxeter groups can be constructed with the use of finite subgroups of quaternions 2 which make the 4 d polytopes more interesting in this paper we will construct the coxeter weyl group in terms of quaternions which requires the use of two different quaternionic representations of the binary icosahedral group the coxeter weyl group is the skeleton of the lie group which has been proposed as the grand unified theory in particle physics 3 constructions of the irreducible representations of the lie group follow the same technique of determination of the orbits ofw therefore two techniques are intimately interrelated to each other where the irreducible representations of the lie group may require several orbits with certain multiplicities 4 aw 5 su 4 aw 4 a 5 su 5 su our main interest here is the construction of the vertices of the polytopes and their dual polytopes in terms of quaternions in section 2 we demonstrate the construction of the coxeter group in terms of quaternions which follows from the quaternionic roots of the coxeter dynkin diagram of in section 3 we develop a technique where one decomposes the orbits of into the orbits of this allows us to view the polytopes in three dimensions as polyhedra displaying the tetrahedral symmetry section 4 deals with the constructions of the duals of the polytopes discussed in section 3 a generalization of the catalan solids to the polytopes in 4 d we discuss our results in section 5 regarding their use in physics 4 a 4 aw 4 a 4 aw 3 aw 4 a 2 2 the coxeter weyl group 4 aw constructed with quaternions let be a real unit quaternion with its conjugate defined by and the norm iieqqq 0 iieq 0

is implicit with the definition of the scalar product pqqpqp 2 1 2 quaternions generate the four dimensional euclidean space the group of quaternions is isomorphic to the lie group which is a double cover of the proper rotation group quaternions have an infinite number of cyclic and dicyclic groups in addition to the binary tetrahedral group t binary octahedral group o and the binary icosahedral

these two decompositions are useful for the projections of the 4 d polytopes of the group into three dimensions under the tetrahedral group and the prismatic groups respectively one can also project

vector 4 3 aw p 21 is left invariant and the others are permuted actually any one of the five vectors in 27 is left invariant under one of the five conjugate groups of the tetrahedral group this proves that any four vectors in 27 form a tetrahedron under one of the conjugate tetrahedral groups implying that five vertices in 27 form a 5 cell in the basis the set of vectors of 5 cell in 27 can

coxeter weyl group 4 aw determination of the archimedean solids dates back to the years of archimedes lived in 287 bc 212 bc after nearly 20 centuries the dual polyhedra of the archimedean solids so called catalan solids are determined by catalan in 1865 16 to our surprise duals of the 4 d uniform polytopes have not been studied so far in this section we discuss the construction of the duals of the 4 d uniform polytopes possessing the symmetry in the references 17 and 18 we have proved that all the catalan solids can be derived from the coxeter diagrams with a simple technique which we will also apply for the constructions of the duals of the 4 d polytopes if we take a vector with the dynkin index then all orbits with except represent the archimedean solids including the platonic polyhedra but snub cube and snub dodecahedron needs a different analysis in terms of coxeter diagrams 18 it is then quiet natural to extend the same analysis to the rank 4 coxeter diagrams and classify the uniform polytopes as the platonic and archimedean polytopes where and the however in mathematical literature the name of the archimedean polytope is strictly used for the polytope whose 4

the duals of the uniform polytopes possessing the coxeter weyl symmetry 4 aw to obtain the vertices of the dual polytope of a given polytope one determines the centers of the cells joined to the vertex the relative magnitudes of these vectors are determined from the fact that the hyperplane formed by the vectors representing the centers of the cells are orthogonal to the vertex let us recall that the dual polytopes are cell transitive similar to the catalan solids which are face transitive in what follows we discuss each uniform polytope in turn 4321 aaaa 4321 aaaa 4 aw 4 1 dual of the 5 cell 1000 1 oo let us recall that the coxeter weyl group 43214 rrrraw acting on the vector 1000 1 generates the vertices of the 5 cell the number of vertices of a polytope is determined as the index of the subgroup leaving the vector in this case 1 invariant since the group fixing 1 is generated by the generators 432 rrr then the index 5 3 4 aw aw determines the number of vertices of the polytope similarly the number of the cells of the polytope is determined by the index of the subgroup 32 rr 13 ra w generating the tetrahedral cell thus 5 3 4 aw aw the center of the first tetrahedron generated by the generators 321 rrr can be taken 1 as 000 4 up to a scale factor since it is left invariant by the generators 321 rrr then one can apply th 44 e group a to obtain 5 vectors which constitute another 5 cell indeed one no 14 w tes that 4 4 aw it is this fact that 5 cell is said to be self aw dual 4 2 dual of the rectified 5 cell 0100 2 oo this uniform polytope is an archimedean polytope since its cells are made of octahedra and tetrahedra the vector 2 is left invariant under the group 43112 rrraaw therefore the number of vertices is given by 10 12 4 aaw aw of the two types of cells the octahedral cells are generated by the tetrahedral group 3213 rrraw along with its five conjugate groups and the tetrahedral cells are generated by the group 432 r 3 rra w and its conjugates therefore the rectified 5 cell has 10 cells the centers of the cells generated by these two groups upon the action on the vector 2 can be taken to be 4 and 1 respectively one can also determine the number of cells which involves 2 as one of the vertices the number of octahedral cells attached to the vector 2 is given by the formula 14 31024 6120 polytope theof verticesofnumber octahedron theof verticesofnumber 3 4 aw aw similarly the number of tetrahedral cells joined to the vector 2 is equal to 2 one can easily check that the centers of the three octahedral cells are given by the vectors 35 4344 2 434434 rrrrrr which form an equilateral triangle the centers of the tetrahedral cells joined to 2 are given by and 11111 r up to a scale factor we note that the vector 1111 r is orthogonal to the plane determined by three vectors in 35 these five vertices must be in the hyperplane orthogonal to the vector 2 then the scale factor can be determined from the scalar product 0

orthogonal to the vector 4 2 434434 rrrr 21 the scale factor is determined to be 7 3 then the vertices of the dual polytope of the truncated 5 cell consist of the union of the orbits 0001 1000 7 3 o

algebra the runcinated 5 cell has the larger symmetry of order 240 the generators fixing the vector 4 aaut 3 and r 41 form a dihedral group of order 6 indicating that the polytope has 20 vertices the polytope has 30 cells 10 of which are the tetrahedral cells and the remaining 20 cells are the triangular prisms each type of cells is also divided into two classes 5 tetrahedral cells are obtained by the group acting on the vector 1 while the other 5 are obtained from the vector 4 there is only 1 tetrahedron of each type joining to the vertex 41 therefore the centers of two tetrahedra sharing the vector 41 can be taken as 4 1 and there are 6 triangular prisms meeting at the vertex 41 the centers of the 3 prisms are represented by the vectors permuted by the dihedral symmetry 3 2 3 r 233 rr 23

has 20 cells whose centers are determined by the vectors of the orbit 41 1001 oo it follows from 15 that the norms of the vectors satisfy 5 6 32 and 5 2 41 therefore 10 of the 17 vertices lie on a 3 sphere with the radius 5 2 and the other 20 vertices lie on a 3 sphere with radius 5 6 since the 8 vertices are in the intersections of the 3 spheres and the hyperplane orthogonal to the vector 41 we
