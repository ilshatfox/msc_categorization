konstantin rybnikov may 17 2001 abstract george voronoi 1908 09 introduced two important reduction methods for positive quadratic forms the reduction with perfect forms and the reduction with l type domains a form is perfect if can be reconstructed from all representations of its arithmetic minimum two forms have the same l type if delaunay tilings of their lattices are affinely equivalent delaunay 1937 38 asked about possible relative volumes of lattice delaunay simplexes we construct an infinite series of delaunay simplexes of relative volume n 3 the best known as of now this series

open convex polyhedral cones such that definition 1 1 1 it is invariant with respect to gl n z 2 there are finitely many inequivalent cones in this partition 3 for each cone c of r and any pqf f in n indeterminates f can be gl n z equivalent to at most finitely many forms lying in c the partition into perfect cones and the l type partition also referred to as the voronoi partition of the 2 nd kind or the partition into voronoi reduction domains are important polyhedral reduction partitions of p n our usage of term domain is lax it should be clear from the context whether we mean the whole arithmetic class or just one element of this class these partitions have been intensively studied in geometry of numbers since times of korkin zolotareff 1873 and voronoi 1908 1909 and more recently in combinatorics e g deza et al 1997 and algebraic geometry e g alexeev 1999 a b in most previous works e g voronoi 1908 1909 ryshkov baranovskii 1976 dickson 1972 the l type partition of p n or sub cones of p n was constructed by refining the perfect partition it is not an exaggeration to say that in almost any systematic study except for engels computational investigations l types were approached via perfect forms for example voronoi started classifying 4 dimensional l types by analyzing the delaunay l tilings of forms lying in the 1 st an and 2 nd dn perfect domains the same route was followed by ryshkov and baranovskii 1976 it was wideley believed that the l type parition is the refinement of the perfect parition i e each convex cone of the perfect partition is the union of finitely many conex cones from the l type partition this conjecture is implicit in voronoi s memoirs 1908 1909 and explicit in dickson 1972 where he showed that the first perfect domain is the only perfect domain which coincided with an l type domain more information on this refinement conjecture and its failure for p n sym 6 r can be found in our note voronoi dickson hypothesis on perfect forms ands l types published in this volume in our paper we continue the above mentioned line of research on the relashionship between these two reduction partitions however we go in the opposite direction we construct an arithmetic class of perfect forms from an arithmetic class of l types remark 1 2 since there is a lot of overlap in references between this paper and our paper on the voronoi dickson hypothesis some of the references for this paper should be found in the bibliography for the other paper such references are quoted in italics e g baranovski 1991 2 2 perfect and l type partitions 2 1 l types definition 2 1 let l be a lattice in rn a convex polyhedron p in rn is called a delaunay cell of l with respect to a positive quadratic form f x x if 1 for each face f of p we have conv l f f 2 there is a quadric circumscribed about p called the empty ellipsoid of p when f x x is positive definite whose quadratic form is f x x in case rank f n this quadric is an elliptic cilinder 3 no points of l lie inside the quadric circumscribed about p when f n i 1 x 2 i our definition coincides with the classical definition of delau nay cell in en delaunay cells form a convex face to face tiling of l that is uniquely defined by l delaunay 1937 two delaunay cells are called homologous is they can be mapped to each other with a composition of a lattice translation and a central inversion with respect to a lattice point definition 2 2 pqfs f 1 and f 2 belong to the same convex l domain if the delaunay tilings of zn with respect to f 1 and f 2 are identical f 1 and f 2 belong to the same l type if these tilings are equivalent with respect to gl n z the folowing proposition establishes the equivalence between the delaunay s def inition of l equivalence for lattices and the notion of l equivalence for arbitrary pqfs which is introduced above proposition 2 3 positive definite forms f and g belong to the same l type if the corresponding lattices belong to the same l type with respect to the form n i 1 x 2 i theorem 2 4 voronoi the parition of p n into l types is a reduction partition moreover it is face to face the notions of delauny tiling and l type are important in the study of extremal and group theoretic properties of lattices see also voronoi dickson hypothesis barnes and dickson 1967 1968 and later in a geometric form delaunay et al 1969 1970 proved the following theorem 2 5 the closure of any n dimensional convex l domain contains at most one local minimum of the sphere covering density the group of gl n z automorphisms of the domain maps this form to itself 3 using this approach delaunay ryshkov and baranovskii 1963 1976 found the best lattice coverings in e 4 and e 5 the theory of l types also has numerous connec tions to combinatorics and in particular to cuts hypermetrics and regular graphs see deza et al 1997 recently v alexeev 1999 a b found exciting connections between compactifications of moduli spaces of principally polirized abelian varities and l types 2 2 perfect cones the l type partition of p n is closely related to the theory of perfect forms orig inated by korkine and zolotareff 1873 let f x x be a pdqf the arithmetic minimum of f x x is the minimum of this form on zn the integral vectors on which this minimum is attained are called the representations of the minimum or the minimal vectors of f x x these vectors have the minimal length among all vectors of zn when f x x is used as the metrical form form f x x is called perfect if it can be reconstructed up to scale from all representations of its arithmetic mini mum in other words a form f x x with the arithmetic minimum m and the set of minimal vectors vk k 1 2 s is perfect if the system n i j 1 aijv i kv j k m where k 1 2 s has a unique solution aij in sym n r rn indeed uniquness requires at least n n 1 minimal vectors definition 2 6 pqfs f 1 and f 2 belong to the same cone of the perfect partition if they both can be written as strictly positive linear combinations of some subset of minimal vectors of a perfect form f 1 and f 2 belong to the same perfect type if there is f 1 equivalent to f 1 such that f 1 and f 2 belong to the same cone of the perfect partition theorem 2 7 voronoi the partition of p n into perfect domains is a reduction partition moreover it is face to face each 1 dimensional cone of this partition lies on p n perfect forms play an important role in lattice sphere packings voronoi s theorem 1908 says that if a form is extreme i e a maximum of the packing density it must also be perfect see coxeter 1951 conway sloane 1988 for the proof the notion of eutactic form arises in the study of the dense lattice sphere packings and is directly related to the notion of perfect form the reciprocal of f x x is a form whose gramm matrix is the inverse of the gramm matrix of f x x the dual form is normally denoted by f x x a form f x x is called eutactic if the dual form f x x can be written as s k 1 k vk x 2 where vk k 1 s is the set of mutually non collinear minimal vectors of f x x and k 0 theorem 2 8 voronoi a form f x x is a maximum of the sphere packing density if and only if f x x is perfect and eutactic 4 voronoi gave an algorithm finding all perfect domains for given n this algorithm is known as voronoi s reduction with perfect forms for the computational analysis of his algorithm and its improvements see martinet 1996 the perfect forms and the incidence graphs of perfect paritions of p n have have been completely described for n 7 2 3 relashionship between perfect domains and l types in terpretable and non interpretable perfect walls voronoi 1908 09 proved that for n 2 3 the l partition and the perfect partition of p n coincide the perfect facet d 4 the 2 nd perfect form in 4 variables exemplifies a new pattern in the relation of these partitions namely the facet d 4 is decomposed into a number of simplicial l type domains like a pie this decomposition consists of the cones with apex at the affine center of this facet over the n 2 faces these simplexes are l type domains of two arithmetic types type i is adjacent to the the perfect l type domain of a 4 type ii is adacent to an arithmetically equivalent l type domain also type ii indeed from the l subdivision of the adjacent d 4 domain for details see delaunay et al 1963 1968 following the lead of voronoi delaunay et al proved that for n 4 the tiling of p n with l type domains refines the partition of this cone into perfect domains ryshkov and baranovskii 1975 proved the refinement hypothesis for n 5 see another our paper from this volume to learn why this hypothesis fails for n 6 in cases where l type domains refine perfect ones the l type is changing on each perfect wall we call such perfect walls interpretable it is not yet clear why some perfect walls are intepretable while other like the wall between domains of types e 6 and e 6 are not below we construct an infinite series of delaunay polytopes rn on n 2 vertices in zn theorem 3 2 we prove that they are repartitoning complexes one of the two triangulations of this polytope has a delaunay simplex of relative volume n 3 this triangulation defines an n dimensional l type domain which is a subcone of a perfect domain tfn that we describe in theorem 5 1 domain of type tfn shares a wall with domain of type dn all forms lying on this wall have the repartitiong complex r in its delaunay tiling 3 fat symplexes it is well known that the delaunay tiling of lattice e 6 consists of gosset polytopes g e g see baranovskii 1991 for properties of g tope see coxeter 1973 1995 all faces of g tope are regular polytopes let s 4 be a 4 face of g tope which is a common facet of two cross polytopal facets since any pair of vertices of g tope is either a diagonal or an edge of a cross polytopal facet there are only two vertices 5 of the polytope which do not have common edges with vertices of s 4 the volume of the convex hull of s 4 and these two distant vertices is 3 times the volume of a fundamental simplex of e 6 using a computer program we checked that there are no other simplexes of volume 3 delaunay or not in g tope below we prove that all simplexes inscribed into g tope are delaunay there are exactly 216 4 faces that serve as common facets of pairs of cross polytopal facets and all of them are equivivalent with respect to the group of the g tope therefore there are exactly 216 delaunay simplexes of relative volume 3 we will often omit the word relative in g tope they are all equivalent with respect to the isometry group of g tope according to ryshkov and baranovskii 1998 there is only one arithmetic type of triple delaunay simplexes in 6 lattices and there are no delaunay simplexes of volume greater than 3 in 6 dimensional lattices in an appropriate coordinate system the vertices here the column vectors of this simplex have the following form 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 there is a repartitioning complex r 6 one of whose triangulations includes the above simplex the vertices of this repartitioning complex are the vertices of the above simplex plus the vertex 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 t delaunay 1937 asked about possible volumes of delaunay simplexes ryshkov 1973 showed that in every dimension 2 r 1 there is a lattice with a delaunay simplex of relative volume r namely ryshkov proved that lattice akn for n 2 k 1 has a delaunay simplex of rel volume k ryshkov also noticed that in the case of akn the existence of big delaunay simplexes is closely related to another interesting phenomenon for n 9 perfect lattice akn is not generated by its shortest vectors earlier coxeter 1951 made a similar observation about the relevance of these two phenomena in case of akn but he did not know for sure if a k n had such big simplexes we generalized the construction of the above simplex to the following series of simplexes of volume n 3 although to our knowledge this is the best infinite series of big delaunay simplexes in leech lattice 24 all delaunay simplexes are non fundamental and the biggest of them has volume 20480 haase and ziegler 2000 showed that for n 3 there are empty lattice simplexes of arbitrary large volume not delaunay indeed a trivial upper bound on the rel volume of a delaunay simplex is n 2 6 sn 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 n 3 the corresponding repartitioning complex is obtained by adjoining vertex 0 0 1 t in this paper we use a short hand notation for n vectors that have few distinct inte gral coordinates and for families of such vectors obtained from some n vector by all circular permutations of selected subsets of its coordinates here are the rules 1 mk stands for k consecutive positions filled with m s 2 square brackets a 1 an are used to denote a vector or type of vector that can be obtained from this vectors by circular permutations in sequences of coordi nates that are separated by commas and bordered on the sides by semicolons and or brackets 3 a family of vectors that are obtained from vector a 1 an a 1 an t by all admissible see 2 permutations is denoted by a 1 an where is the number of such vectors if 1 we omit example 1 n 3 02 3 n 1 2 stands for all vectors with 3 at the last entry two 0 s and n 3 1 s among the first n 1 coordinates to prove that the above simplex is a lattice delaunay simplex we need the theory of 0 1 dual systems developed by erdahl and ryshkov 1990 1991 a b let s be a set of integer vectors in zn the 0 1 dual of s is the set of all integer vectors in zn that have the scalar product of 0 or 1 with all vectors of s we denote the 0 1 dual of s by s 0 erdahl and ryshkov 1990 showed that if the double dual of an integral simplex has only n 2 points then this simplex is a delaunay simplex for some pdqfs theorem 3 1 erdahl ryshkov let s be a set of vectors in zn if s 0 0 0 n consists of n 1 linearly independent vectors then there is an n dimensional cone of pdqfs for which s is a delaunay simplex in zn using the erdahl ryshkov theorem we verify in the following proposition that our series is indeed a series of lattice delaunay simplexes theorem 3 2 for any n 3 there are lattices with delaunay simplex of volume n 3 7 proof let sn be a simplex in z n whose vertices are the columns of the following matrix sn in 1 1 n 1 0 tn 1 n 3 here in 1 is the n 1 n 1 identity matrix 1 n 1 is the column n 1 vector of ones and 0 tn 1 is the row n 1 vector of zeros s 0 n cannot have vectors with negative numbers in positions 1 through n 1 for sn contains an identity submatrix in 1 we use sn to refer to both the simplex and its matrix since sn has a vector with n 3 at the last coordinate s 0 n does not have vectors with the absolute value of the last coordinate different from 0 or 1 meanwhile the last coordinate cannot be negative since it would imply that one of the first n 1 coordinates is negative thus 0 and 1 are the only choices for the last coordinate of a vector of s 0 n if a vector of s 0 n has 0 at the last position it can have at most one 1 among the other coordinates evidently if a vector of s 0 n has 1 at the last position it can have either n 2 or n 1 ones among the other coordinates therefore the dual of sn consists of the following 0 1 vectors 1 all vectors with 0 at the last position and one 1 among the first n 1 coordinates i e 1 0 n 2 0 n 1 2 all vectors with 1 at the last position and n 2 1 s among the first n 1 coordinates i e 1 n 2 0 1 n 1 3 all vectors with 1 at the last position and n 3 1 s among the first n 1 coordinates i e 1 n 3 02 1 n 1 2 4 the zero vector 0 n it is easy to see that s 0 n 0 sn 0 n 1 1 i e the double dual of sn is obtained by adding a vector with zero coordinates except for only 1 at the very last position denote by d the matrix whose columns are the elements of s 0 n 0 n the images of vectors of s 0 n 0 n under the voronoi mapping are linearly independent in rn since there is an n n 1 matrix m such that dtm in 1 we omit details here however we will provide them in a more consecutive paper thus rank one forms corresponding to the vectors of s 0 n span a cone of co dimension 1 in p n this is the cone of all pdqfs for which conv s 0 n 0 is a delaunay cell in zn it is interesting that for n 6 this cone coincides with the wall between the domains of 61 6 1 d 6 and e 6 by the above theorem sn is a delaunay simplex in z n for some pdqfs 4 tame wall and interpretability there are many instances of coincidence of l walls and perfect walls in particular for n 6 all perfect walls are also l walls although already for n 4 there are l walls which are not perfect walls see ryshkov baranovskii 1976 definition 4 1 we call a wall between two n dimensional l type domains p inter pretable if it is also a wall between two perfect domains conversely a perfect wall is called l interpretable if is also a wall between two l type domains 8 let rn be the repartitioning complex obtained by adding 0 n 1 1 to sn i e rn sn 0 n 1 1 set r n rn 0 n as shown above the voronoi images of the vectors of s 0 n span a cone of co dimension 1 in r n it follows from the definition of 0 1 dual system that the interior of this cone consists of all pdqfs that have rn among their delaunay cells voronoi showed that any such cone must be an l wall we call this wall tw n let us prove that for any n 4 tw n is a wall between the second perfect form dn and a new perfect form this new form exhibits a very interesting geometric behavior in all dimensions but this will be the subject of another paper 5 perfect wall tamed by big simplex theorem 5 1 for any n 4 the cone tw n is a common wall of the perfect domain of type dn and the domain of perfect form tfn where tfn aij n is defined as follows for even n aii 1 if 1 i n 1 ann 1 2 n 2 7 2 n 7 aij n 4 2 n 2 for i 6 j j 6 n ain 1 n 2 6 n 10 2 n 2 for i n for odd n aii 1 if 1 i n 1 ann n 3 8 n 2 23 n 20 2 n 1 aij n 3 2 n 1 for i 6 j j n ain 1 n 2 5 n 8 2 n 1 for i n in lower dimensions tf 5 5 2 iii d perfect form of korkine and zolotareff tf 6 e 6 proof to prove that tw n is a wall of a perfect domain we have to complement the vectors of v r n to a set p of at least n n 1 2 primitive integral vectors such that the voronoi image of these vectors defines a hyperplane in rn we call elements of p r n complimentary vectors below we give two ways to complement v r n to the set voronoi images of minimal vectors for a perfect form a second perfect form the complimentary vectors are of type 1 1 0 n 3 0 thus they lie in one of the half spaces defined by tw n let fij be a quadratic form defined by the following formulae fii 1 for i n 1 fnn 1 n 2 2 fij 1 2 for i 6 j and i n and 9 fin n 2 2 the minimum of f is 1 and it is attained on all vectors of r n and all n 1 2 vectors of type 1 1 0 n 3 0 denote by compdn the set of all vectors whose coordinates are obtained by circular permutations of the first n 1 positions of 1 1 0 n 3 0 except for 1 0 n 3 1 0 let us show that fij is integrally equivalent to dn with respect to the scalar product defined by fij the following integral vectors forms a coxeter diagram for dn compdn 0 n 1 1 0 1 n 2 0 1 in this diagram 0 n 3 1 1 0 is the vertex of valence 3 and 0 n 1 1 0 1 n 2 0 1 are the vertices of the two leaves of the diagram which are adjacent to 0 n 3 1 1 0 vectors 0 n 1 1 0 1 n 2 0 1 and vectors of compdn obviously form a basis of z n therefore fij is integrally equivalent to dn notice that r n 1 1 0 n 3 0 n 1 2 n n 1 which is half the number of minimal vectors of dn therefore r n 1 1 0 n 3 0 n 1 2 and their inverses are all of the minimal vectors of fij dn b generalization of the third perfect form notice that tfn is 1 for all v r n set w n 2 the choice of complimentary vectors depends on the parity of the dimension 1 when n is even and n 4 the complimentary vectors for tfn are w 2 n 1 w 1 w 1 w 2 n 2 w 1 n 1 w 1 n 1 w the total number of minimal vectors of is n n 3 2 when n is odd the complimentary vector for tfn is w 1 n 1 w the total number of minimal vectors is n n 1 with respect to the standard scalar product tw n is defined by the equation n x 0 where n is given by formulae nii 0 for i n nin n 22 n 4 for i n nij 1 for i 6 j j n nnn n 3 9 n 2 24 n 19 2 n 4 for any n 3 tfn is a unique hyperplane in r n containing both r n and the complementary vectors because for both even and odd n the complementary vectors form non zero scalar products with n and therefore do not belong to the hyperplane containing the cone tw n to prove that tfn is positive definite it is enough to show that det tfn 0 since all other main minors of tfn correspond to bases formed by vectors of length 1 with angles arccos aij between them here we use the correspondence between bases and quadratic form if we can construct a basis whose gramm matrix is aij then det tfn 0 evidently there exist n 1 vectors v 1 vn 1 in rn so that vi vj aij for i j n now the norm of vn must be ann if the cos of the acute angle between say v 1 and d n 1 j 1 vj d is the diagonal of the parallelogram based on basis v 1 vn 1 is greater than arccos ain aiiann where i n then one can construct vector vn of norm ann such that vi vn ain 10 for odd n this is equivalent to showing that a 2 in annaii 2 n 2 6 n 10 2 n 1 4 n 2 2 n 3 8 n 2 23 n 20 2 n 2 n 3 n 1 2 2 n 2 5 n 8 v 1 d 2 v 1 v 1 d d for even n this is equivalent to showing that a 2 in annaii 10 n 2 6 n 2 2 n 2 7 n 14 n 2 2 2 n 2 n 1 v 1 d 2 v 1 v 1 d d using elementary algebra and calculus we have checked that both these inequali ties hold for all n 4 the arithmetic minimum of tfn is 1 and the number of minimal vectors is n n 3 for even n and n n 1 for oddn for example this can be shown by the method of prejective inequalities orginated by korkin and zolotareff see anzin 1991 un fortunately the proof is too tedious and we have to leave it out we will publish the proof in another more technical paper for all n the number of minimal vectors of tfn is equal to that of hn of anzin 1991 it is not difficult to show anzin private communication that for n 5 6 7 tfn is equivalent to his form hn we refer to tw n as a tame perfect wall because it admits an interesting l interpretation described above for n 6 tf 6 e 6 proved in voronoi dickson hy pothesis this volume and tw n is one of the three up to gl n z equivalence walls of the domain of e 6 see barnes 1957 and the other two walls called w 2 24 and w 3 21 by barnes are wild as there is no change of l type at almost all interior points of these perfect walls the proof that w 2 24 is not interpretable can be found in the other paper by us from this volume we plan to publish the proof that w 3 21 is not interpretable later for n 7 tf 7 7 15 from stacey s 1973 1975 list see anzin 1991 and martinet 1996 for 715 after this paper had been submitted for publication maxim anzin noticed that in lower dimensions n 5 6 7 our series coincides with anzin s 1991 series hn maxim informed us that he is about to prove that tfn hn for all n 6 the case of n 6 l partition of e 6 in this subsection we discuss delaunay tilings of lattices lying in a small neigbourhood of e 6 in the space of parameters more specifically we look at the l partition of p n near the ray corresponding of e 6 the delaunay tiling of lattice e 6 is formed by congruent copies of the gosset polytope 221 in coxeter s notation which is the convex hull of a unique two distance spherical set in e 6 we refer to the gosset polytope as the g 6 tope the g 6 topes of the delaunay tiling of e 6 fall into two translation classes the star of a lattice point is formed by 54 g 6 topes 27 in each translation class 11 theg 6 tope is quite remarkable it has 27 vertices 216 edges 72 regular simplicial facets and 36 regular cross polytopal facets e g coxeter 1995 thus the vertices of the g 6 tope form a spherical two distance set polytopes whose vertices form a spherical two distance sets are interesting combinatorial objects see deza and laurent 1997 deza grishukhin laurent 1992 in the case of g 6 tope the two distance structure is realized so that for each vertex v of the g 6 tope there is a vector pv such that the vertex set of g 6 tope can be represented as v v 1 v 2 where v 1 u s u v p 1 and v 2 u s u v p 2 for a detailed description of geometric and group theoretic properties of the g 6 tope see coxeter 1973 1995 below we show that for every subset of vertices of a dealunay cell of e 6 e 6 can be perturbed so that this subset becomes a delaunay cell for the perturbed lattice in particular this implies that there are perturbations of e 6 having a delaunay simplex of volume 3 the maximal relative volume of a delaunay lattice simplex in e 6 proposition 6 1 for every convex polytope d whose vertex set is a subset of the vertex set of the g 6 tope there is a perturbation of e 6 making d a delaunay polytope for the perturbed lattice proof denote by e 6 x an inhomogenious quadratic function whose quadratic part is e 6 and such that e 6 x 0 is an ellipsoid circumscribing the g tope for 0 consider quadratic function x e 6 x v d p v x 1 p v x 2 when is sufficiently small the quadratic part of e 6 x is close to e 6 in the space of parameters the ellipsoid e 6 0 circumscribes d since forms pv x 1 pv x 2 v d guarantee that all vertices of the g tope that are not in d lie outside of e 6 0 we thank maxim anzin for interesting discussion and valuable comments on this paper references 1 m m anzin
