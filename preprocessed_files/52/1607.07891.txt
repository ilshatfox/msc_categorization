computing or at least estimating the lw number n i e the supremum of all such that for each convex body k in rn there exists an orthonormal basis u 1 un such that voln k n 1 n i 1 voln 1 k u i where k u i denotes the orthogonal projection of k onto the hyperplane u i perpendicular to ui any such inequality can be regarded as a reverse to the well known classical loomis whitney inequality we present various results on such reverse loomis whitney inequalities in particular we prove some structural results give bounds on n and deal with the problem of actually computing the lw constant of a rational polytope 1 introduction 1 1 the loomis whitney inequality the well known loomis whitney inequality 44 states that for any lebesgue measurable set a in rn 1 n a n 1 n i 1 n 1 a e i where ei is the ith standard coordinate vector of r n i n 1 n k denotes the k dimensional lebesgue measure and a u stands for the orthogonal projection of a on the hyperplane u through the origin perpendicular to u rn 0 the original proof by loomis and whitney is based on a combinatorial argument note that as coordinate boxes are examples of sets for which equality holds 1 is tight recently 5 and 28 gave general stability results which in particular yield characterizations of equality in 1 for instance in the class of bodies i e connected compact sets which are the closure of their interior 1 holds with equality for and only for coordinate boxes see 28 corollary 2 over the years the loomis whitney inequality has been extended generalized and used in other mathematical areas in various ways for instance 9 and 16 consider versions involving projections on coordinate subspaces of any dimension 1 establishes a connection with shearer s entropy inequality 2 gives a generalization for projections along other suitable directions 7 8 11 prove extensions to analytical inequalities 6 shows its relevance for the multilinear kakeya conjecture and 37 studies its implications in group theory the very recent papers 12 13 32 give various generalizations particularly in the context of the 1 http arxiv org abs 1607 07891 v 2 2 s campi p gritzmann and p gronchi uniform cover inequality for the average volume of sections or between quermassintegrals of convex bodies and extremal or average projections on lower dimensional spaces respectively fields of applications of loomis whitney type inequalities range from microscopy and stereology 61 to geochemistry 60 astrophysics 53 and information theory 24 38 see 19 and 20 for other examples 1 2 reversing the inequality while the loomis whitney inequality gives an estimate of the lebesgue measure of a set a from above the present paper asks for a corresponding estimate from below since the case of n 1 is trivial we assume in the following that n 2 of course in general n a can be made arbitrarily small by removing suitable subsets of interior points from a without changing its projections therefore we are quite naturally led to the class kn of convex bodies and we will write volk now rather than k this restriction already allows the reverse inequality by meyer 48 2 voln k n 1 n 1 nn 1 n i 1 voln 1 k e i in terms of sections with coordinate hyperplanes instead of projections in 2 equality holds if and only if k is a coordinate crosspolytope i e the convex hull of segments iei iei with i 0 i n however even for convex bodies only trivial reverse loomis whitney inequalities exist if we insist on projections onto coordinate hyperplanes in fact let tn denote the n dimensional regular simplex in rn we speak of the regular simplex since our problem is invariant under similarity anyway further let t n 1 conv e 1 en rn be the standard embedding of tn 1 in r n then voln t n 1 0 while voln 1 t n 1 e i 1 n 1 hence the family s 0 1 n of the convex hulls of t n 1 and the point r n cannot satisfy the inequality voln s n 1 n i 1 voln 1 s e i for any positive constant therefore we allow rotations first i e we project on hyperplanes u i perpendicular to the vectors u 1 un of an orthonormal basis of r n 1 3 reverse loomis whitney inequalities and lw numbers any orthonormal basis f u 1 un of rn will be called a frame and the set of all frames f will be denoted by fn further for k kn and f u 1 un fn let k f n i 1 voln 1 k u i k f voln k n 1 k f the quantities k f and k f will be called the projection average and the lw ratio of k for f respectively then k min f fn k f k max f fn k f on the reverse loomis whitney inequality 3 are the minimal projection average and the lw constant of k respectively note that by compactness of the euclidean unit sphere in rn the minimum on the left and hence the maximum on the right are indeed attained a frame producing the minimum projection average k for the given convex body k will be called a best frame for k obviously the lw ratio is invariant under similarity we are interested in the best universal lw constant i e the lw number of kn n inf k kn k in other words we want to compute or at least estimate the supremum n of all such that for each convex body k in rn there exists an orthonormal basis u 1 un satisfying voln k n 1 n i 1 voln 1 k u i any inequality of this type will be called a reverse loomis whitney inequality the paper is organized as follows section 2 is devoted to some preliminaries section 3 will give an overview of our main results and open problems section 4 will link a best frame for a polytope p to a rectangular box of smallest volume containing the projection body of p and will then show how best frames relate to the facets of p in section 5 we will estimate n as well as k for special bodies like simplices and regular crosspolytope section 6 will deal with algorithmic issues the final section 7 will provide results for some related functionals 2 preliminaries for easier reference we collect in this section some notation used throughout the paper specific terms related to computational aspects will be given at the beginning of section 6 we shall denote by the euclidean norm by bn the unit ball and by sn 1 the unit sphere in rn we shall mean by convex body in rn a compact convex subset of rn with nonempty interior and we shall denote by kn the class of n dimensional convex bodies moreover kno will denote the subclass of all origin symmetric convex bodies in addition to the volume voln k we shall also need the surface area s k of a convex body k and the corresponding isoperimetric ratio iso k voln k n 1 s k n for k kn the support function hk is defined by hk u max utx x k u sn 1 where ut stands for the transpose of u the radial function k of k is k u max u k u sn 1 4 s campi p gritzmann and p gronchi for any k kn containing the origin in its interior the polar of k is the convex body k such that 3 k u hk u 1 u sn 1 the projection body k of k is the convex body defined by 4 h k u voln 1 k u u sn 1 the body k is origin symmetric in fact it is a full dimensional zonoid see e g 57 p 302 58 if p is a polytope in kn then p is a zonotope i e the minkowski sum of finitely many line segments more precisely if f 1 fm denote the facets of p with corresponding outward unit normals a 1 am then 5 p 1 2 m j 1 voln 1 fj aj aj where aj aj denotes the line segment from aj to aj we shall make use of an inequality due to zhang 62 involving the polar k of the projection body k of k using the abbreviation k for k it says that for k kn 6 voln k n 1 2 n n nn voln k with equality if and only if k is a simplex finally a rectangular crosspolytope is the convex hull of segments iui iui with i 0 i n where u 1 un is a frame a coordinate crosspolytope is one corresponding to the standard orthonormal basis 3 main results and open problems our first theorem links best frames for polytopes to their facets more specifically we have the following result theorem 1 let p kn be a polytope and let f u 1 un be a best frame for f then at least n 1 of the vectors ui are parallel to a facet of p the proof of theorem 1 will be given in section 4 our next result settles the problem in the plane theorem 2 if k is a planar convex body then k 1 2 and equality holds if and only if k is a triangle the planar case suggests computing the lw constant sn of n dimensional simplices sn on the reverse loomis whitney inequality 5 theorem 3 let sn be an n dimensional simplex in r n n 3 then n 1 2 n 2 nn 1 sn tn n 1 nn 1 the next result follows immediately from 2 with the aid of theorem 1 for excluding equality proposition 4 let k kn if voln 1 k e i voln 1 k e i i n then k n 1 nn 1 for the general case we have a somewhat weaker bound theorem 5 for every k kn k 2 n n 2 n n in a previous arxiv version of the present paper we asked for the asymptotic behavior of n as n subsequently the authors of 42 showed that the correct order is n n 2 which in particular implies that simplices do not provide the worst case their proof relies heavily on previous work in 2 and 3 theorems 2 3 and 5 will be proved in section 5 in section 6 we will deal with various algorithmic issues related to reverse loomis whitney inequalities and give a tractability result in fixed dimension more precisely we show that there is a pseudopolynomial algorithm for approximating p whose running time depends on the binary size of the input the error and a lower bound on the isoperimetric ratio iso p of p theorem 6 let the dimension n be fixed for a given rational polytope p a given q with 0 iso p and a given bound 0 1 q we can compute a number such that p 1 in time that is polynomial in size p 1 and 1 of course the dependence on iso p can be dropped in theorem 6 if we restrict the poly topes to any class for which there exists a function f n m depending only on n and for each fixed n only polynomially on the number m of facets such that iso p f n m we do not know whether there is an algorithm that only depends on size p and 1 in any case we presume that in theorem 6 the condition that n is fixed cannot be lifted actually we conjecture that the problem given a rational polytope p presented by its vertices or facet halfspaces and a precision p approximate p up to p binary digits 6 s campi p gritzmann and p gronchi is p hard see conjecture 20 in the final section 7 we present various results on functionals related to in particular we consider the functional which associates with k kn the volume ratio of k and a rectangular box of minimal volume containing k the problem of finding a rectangular box of minimal volume enclosing a body has been studied extensively for n 2 3 in computational geometry as it appears in various practical tasks in particular applications are reported in robot grasping 39 industrial packing and optimal design 22 hierarchical partitioning of sets of points or set theoretic estimation 4 23 and state estimation of dynamic systems 49 4 projection bodies and best frames for polytopes we begin by observing that the best frames for a given k kn are related to volume minimal rectangular boxes containing the projection body k of k lemma 7 let k kn let b denote a rectangular box of smallest volume containing k and let u 1 un be its outward unit normals then f u 1 un constitutes a best frame for k and vice versa proof let f v 1 vn be a frame and let b be the rectangular box of minimal volume containing k whose outward unit normals are v 1 vn then each facet of b contains a point of k moreover k is origin symmetric and consequently b is origin symmetric too hence voln b n i 1 2 hb vi 2 n n i 1 h k vi 2 n n i 1 voln 1 k v i 2 n k f thus any smallest box containing k induces a best frame for k and vice versa as lemma 7 shows the problem of determining k is indeed a special instance of a containment problem see 34 for a survey on general containment problems actually by lemma 7 k is closely related to the functional k max f fn voln k voln b k f where b k f is the rectangular box of minimal volume containing k with edges parallel to the vectors in f note that in the plane k is the ratio of vol 2 k and the area of the minimal area rectangle circumscribed about k i e for k k 2 we have k k in general the two functionals are related through the petty functional 54 k voln k n 1 voln k more precisely k 2 n k k on the reverse loomis whitney inequality 7 while the functional has attracted much interest in the theory of convex bodies the determination of its extreme values is still open see 30 pp 375 380 and 57 pp 577 578 in particular it was conjectured by petty that attains its maximum if and only if k is an ellipsoid on the other hand brannen 10 conjectured that the minimum is attained if k is a simplex as k k fork k 2 ifk is a polygon the following result reduces the computation of k to a comparison of finitely many values proposition 8 freeman and shapira 29 let p be a planar convex polygon then every rectangle of minimal area containing p has at least one edge parallel to an edge of p we now turn to dimensions n 3 even though results on minimal volume enclosing rectangular boxes cannot be evoked directly anymore we will see that lemma 7 is still useful we first point out that in dimension three an analogous result to proposition 8 holds proposition 9 o rourke 52 let p be a polytope in r 3 then every minimal volume rectangular box containing p has at least two adjacent faces both containing more than one point of p next we prove a structural result in arbitrary dimensions theorem 10 let p be a convex polytope in rn and let b be a rectangular box of minimal volume containing p then b has at most one pair of opposite facets whose intersections with p are just a single point each proof let b be a rectangular box of minimal volume containing p and let v 1 vn be the outward unit normals of the facets of b suppose that there are two pairs of opposite facets containing just one point of p each and let v 1 and v 2 be their normals among all frames in rn we focus on those which contain v 3 vn and have the remaining two in the plane v lin v 1 v 2 spanned by v 1 and v 2 all such frames are related to each other through a rotation in v i e a rotation with axis w lin v 3 vn in order to minimize the volume of the bounding box associated to each such frame we have to minimize the product of the widths of p in two orthogonal directions of v therefore we need to minimize the area of the rectangle bounding p v by proposition 8 the minimum is attained by a rectangle which contains an edge of p v in its boundary so b cannot have two pairs of opposite facets each containing a unique point of p we can now prove theorem 1 proof of theorem 1 by lemma 7 every best frame of p corresponds to a minimal volume rectangular box b containing p since p is origin symmetric theorem 10 guarantees that each facet of b except possibly one pair of opposite facets contains at least two points of p and consequently contains a face of p of dimension at least one since p is a zonotope each of its faces is the minkowski sum of some of its generating segments in particular this means that each facet of b except possibly one pair of opposite facets is parallel to at least one segment generating p therefore each vector of a best frame with possibly one exception is parallel to at least one facet of p 8 s campi p gritzmann and p gronchi 5 bounds on the computation of 2 is based on the results of section 4 more precisely on proposition 8 and lemma 7 proof of theorem 2 in order to prove the inequality it is enough to show that for every planar convex body k there exists a frame u 1 u 2 such that the area of the rectangle circumscribed about k with edges parallel to u 1 and u 2 is not larger than twice the area of k let a b k be such that a b is the diameter diamk of k further let u 1 a b a b and let u 2 s 1 be perpendicular to u 1 then the lines a lin u 2 and b lin u 2 support k let c d k be such that c lin u 1 and d lin u 1 are different supporting lines to k then the four corresponding halfplanes define a rectangle b circumscribed about k note that the four points a b c d need not all be distinct now set p conv a b c d then we have vol 2 b 2 vol 2 p 2 vol 2 k with equality if and only if k p finally suppose that k 1 2 then k p and b is a rectangle of minimal area containing k hence by proposition 8 one of the edges of b must contain two points of a b c d since a and b are the endpoints of a diameter of k it follows that c or d belongs to the line segment a b hence k must be a triangle the result 2 1 2 of theorem 2 deals with the worst case among all planar convex bodies it may however also be of interest to regard restricted classes a natural class to consider is kno i e that of origin symmetric convex bodies and hence to define o n inf k kn o k the following remark shows that already in the plane some caution has to be exercised since unlike for 2 the infimum need no longer be attained lemma 11 the number o 2 equals 2 but the infimum is not attained proof in view of theorem 2 and its characterization of the equality case it suffices to construct a sequence of planar origin symmetric convex bodies whose lw constant tends to 1 2 for l 0 1 let rl denote a rhombus whose diagonals have length 2 and 2 l respectively by theorem 8 the best frame for rl has a direction parallel to one of its edges hence by elementary calculations we obtain rl 2 l 4 l 1 l 2 1 1 l 2 2 which tends to 1 2 as l 0 the results for the planar case suggest to focus on simplices in rn we now prove theorem 3 on the reverse loomis whitney inequality 9 proof of theorem 3 we start with the proof of the upper bound let f u 1 un be any frame for v sn 1 let l v denote the length of the longest chord in sn parallel to v then 7 voln sn l v n voln 1 sn v by 45 simplices are the only sets which satisfy this formula for all v sn 1 note that sn contains the convex hull q of the chords of length l ui parallel to ui for all i n therefore 8 voln sn voln q n i 1 l ui n the latter inequality can be proved by induction on n on noting that n voln q l ui voln 1 q u i for each i n an easy consequence of an inequality by rogers and shephard 55 by 7 and 8 we obtain sn f voln sn n 1 n i 1 voln 1 sn u i voln sn n 1 n i 1 l ui voln sn nnn n nn and hence sn n 1 nn 1 we claim that equality holds for tn denote by a a vertex of tn by tn 1 its opposite facet by v the outward unit normal to tn 1 and by ha the distance from a to tn 1 the line through a parallel to v intersects tn 1 therefore voln 1 tn v voln 1 tn 1 for every frame f v 1 vn with v 1 v we have voln 1 tn v i ha n 1 voln 2 tn 1 v i for i 2 n clearly voln tn ha n voln 1 tn 1 consequently tn f voln 1 tn 1 n 1 hn 1 a n 1 n 1 nn 1 voln 1 tn 1 hn 1 a n i 2 voln 2 tn 1 v i n 1 n 1 nn 1 tn 1 f v 1 this implies tn n 1 n 1 nn 1 tn 1 since tn max f v 1 f tn f applying this inequality recursively and using that t 2 1 2 proves the claim next we prove the lower bound for sn the argument is rather similar to the one for tn 10 s campi p gritzmann and p gronchi we denote by ai i n 1 the vertices of sn by fi the facet opposite to ai and by hi the distance from ai to fi let f 1 be a facet of sn with largest n 1 dimensional volume and let v be its outward unit normal we assume without loss of generality that f 1 v we claim that voln 1 sn v 2 voln 1 f 1 to see this let pi denote the projection of ai onto v i n 1 so pi ai for i 6 1 then sn v conv p 1 pn 1 let l be the simplex in v each of whose facets is parallel to a facet of f 1 and contains the vertex of f 1 opposite this facet note that l is up to translation equal to nf 1 since voln 1 f 1 is maximal it is at least as large as the n 1 dimensional volume of the projection of each facet fi onto v and then as large as the n 1 dimensional volume of the convex hull of any n of the pi s it follows that the distance from p 1 to any facet e of f 1 is less than the height of f 1 relative to e therefore p 1 is contained in the slab determined on v by the two planes parallel to e and at a distance equal to the height of f 1 relative to e repeating the argument for all facets of f 1 we deduce that p 1 l let g x voln 1 conv f 1 x x v then g p 1 voln 1 sn v moreover g x is a convex function of x this is a consequence of 57 theorem 10 4 1 and follows easily from its specialization 57 p 543 with k 0 f 1 and k 1 x therefore the maximum value of g is attained at some vertex w of l notice that w is on the boundary of each slab considered before moreover if we assume e is the facet of f 1 parallel to the facet of l opposite to w we see that e cuts conv f 1 w in two simplices of equal n 1 dimensional volume hence g w 2 voln 1 f 1 this maximum cannot be attained or else a facet of sn would have a projection onto v with the same volume as f 1 thus g p 1 g w and this proves the claim now for every frame f v 1 vn with v 1 v we have voln 1 sn v i h 1 n 1 voln 2 f 1 v i for i 2 n voln sn h 1 n voln 1 f 1 therefore we deduce sn f voln 1 f 1 n 1 hn 11 n 1 n 1 2 nn 1 voln 1 f 1 h n 1 1 n i 2 voln 2 f 1 v i n 1 n 1 2 nn 1 f 1 f v 1 since sn max f v 1 f sn f we get sn n 1 n 1 2 nn 1 f 1 which applied recursively together with s 2 1 2 yields the assertion we notice that the proof of theorem 3 makes use of few properties of the regular simplex indeed we observe that the inductive step holds whenever one altitude of a simplex falls into the opposite facet unfortunately for n 3 there exist simplices with no internal altitude corollary 12 let sn be a simplex then sn n n n if and only if there exists a frame f u 1 un such that the convex hull of the maximal chords of sn parallel to u 1 un respectively is sn itself on the reverse loomis whitney inequality 11 proof if sn n n n then equality holds in 8 and so sn q corollary 13 let sn be a simplex if sn n n n then every best frame contains a vector that is parallel to an edge of sn proof consider a best frame f by corollary 12 the vertices of sn are extremal points of some maximal chord parallel to a direction in f since we have n 1 vertices and n chords surely at least one chord contains two vertices which is what we want to prove example 14 there are simplices s in r 3 with s 2 9 for example consider a rect angular box with edges of length 1 2 4 and the simplex s which is the convex hull of four vertices of the box no two connected by an edge of the box the edges of s have length 5 17 and 2 5 by theorem 3 with n 3 s 2 9 suppose that s 2 9 let f v 1 v 2 v 3 be a best frame of s by corollary 13 f contains a direction say v 1 parallel to one of the edges of s say e since s has no pair of orthogonal edges by corollary 12 we infer that the maximal chords of s parallel to v 2 and v 3 respectively each contain a vertex of s not in e taking into account that a maximal chord through a vertex has to intersect the opposite facet elementary but tedious calculations show that we get a contradiction hence s 2 9 for general convex bodies we can give a positive lower bound for n it is based on the following lemma lemma 15 if k kno then there exists a rectangular crosspolytope c contained in k with voln k n voln c proof we use induction on the dimension n for n 2 the statement follows by taking c to be the convex hull of a diameter of k and an orthogonal maximal chord let n 3 and suppose that the asserted inequality holds in dimension n 1 let v sn 1 be the direction of a diameter of k since k is origin symmetric it follows from the brunn minkowski inequality see e g 30 p 415 that vn 1 k v is largest among all sections k v v r parallel to v hence 9 voln k diamk voln 1 k v by the induction hypothesis there exists an n 1 dimensional rectangular crosspolytope c in k v with 10 voln 1 k v n 1 voln 1 c let c conv 1 2 diamk v v c and note that c is a rectangular crosspolytope using 9 and 10 we obtain voln k n 1 diamk voln 1 c n voln c which completes the proof 12 s campi p gritzmann and p gronchi now we can prove theorem 5 proof of theorem 5 it suffices to show that for every k kn there exists a frame f u 1 un such that k f 2 n n 2 n n let f be the frame that consists of the directions of the axes of a rectangular crosspolytope c of maximum volume contained in k by 3 4 6 and lemma 15 we have k f voln k n 1 n i 1 h k ui 2 n n 2 nnn n i 1 2 k ui voln k 2 n n 2 nnn n voln c voln k 2 n n 2 n n which proves the assertion since the case of the standard cube is trivial and that of the simplex is investigated in theorem 3 it might be worthwhile to consider the last of the three regular polytopes that exist in any dimension the regular crosspolytope cn conv e 1 en theorem 16 cn n 1 2 n 2 nn 1 for n even n 1 2 n 12 nn 1 for n odd proof first note that voln cn 2 n n voln 1 cn e 1 2 n 1 n 1 and that all the facets of cn are regular simplices tn 1 with voln 1 tn 1 n n 1 also if u is the direction of an edge of cn e g u 1 2 e 1 e 2 and wj j 2 n denote the 2 n facet outward unit normals 1 n 1 n of cn we have voln 1 cn u 1 2 voln 1 tn 1 2 n j 1 utwj 1 2 2 n 1 2 n 2 2 2 1 2 n 1 2 n 1 now let n be even then for i n 2 the vectors u 2 i 1 1 2 0 0 1 1 0 0 t u 2 i 1 2 0 0 1 1 0 0 t on the reverse loomis whitney inequality 13 where the first nonzero entries are in the 2 i 1 th position corresponding to directions of edges of cn form a frame f therefore cn cn f voln cn n 1 voln 1 cn u n n 1 2 n 2 nn 1 if n is odd we use n 1 projections along edges and one projection along an orthogonal coordinate direction e and obtain cn voln cn n 1 voln 1 cn u n 1 voln 1 cn e n 1 2 n 12 nn 1 which completes the proof conjecture 17 let n be even then cn n 1 2 n 2 nn 1 note that conjecture 17 is trivially correct for n 2 follows from 46 for n 4 and for general even n from the conjecture of 46 p 167 that the orthogonal projections of cn of minimal volume occur in the direction of edges of cn we remark that when specified appro priately the problems of finding maximal or minimal projections of polytopes on hyperplanes are np hard even for very special classes of polytopes see 17 and 18 6 algorithmic issues we will now deal with the reverse loomis whitney problem from a computational point of view in order to be able to employ the binary turing machine model we will restrict our considerations to rational polytopes 6 1 volume computation and the case of variable dimension since the projection averages and the lw constant involve volume computations we begin with a brief account of the algorithmic properties of the task to compute or approximate the volume of given polytopes let p and q be polytopes in rn we say that p is anh polytope and write p n m a b if p is specified by n m n a qm n and b qm such that p x rn ax b similarly q is called a v polytope written q n k v if q is specified by n k n v qn with k v and q conv v as it is well known each h polytope admits a v presentation each v polytope admits an h presentation and one presentation can be derived from the other in polynomial time if the dimension n is fixed as for instance the standard n cube has 2 n facets but 2 n vertices and the standard n cross polytope has 2 n facets but 2 n vertices we have however to distinguish the different kinds of representations if the dimension is part of the input in the binary turing machine model the size of the input is measured as the length size p of the binary encoding needed to present the input data the running time of an algorithm 14 s campi p gritzmann and p gronchi is defined in terms of the number of operations of its corresponding turing machine see e g 31 in the sequel h volume and v volume will denote the following decision versions given an h polytope or a v polytope p respectively and q with 0 decide whether voln p in the randomized case there are additional positive rationals and and the task is to determine a positive rational random variable such that prob voln p 1 1 the following proposition summarizes complexity results that are relevant for our purpose the non trivial results are due to 25 26 40 41 and 43 see 35 and 36 for more details further references to related results and extensions proposition 18 1 if the dimension is fixed and p is a v or an h polytope the volume of p can be computed in polynomial time 2 if p is a v polytope then the binary size of voln p is bounded above by a polynomial in the input size in general the binary size of voln p for h polytopes p is not bounded above by a polynomial in the input size 3 h volume and v volume are p hard if fact the problem of computing the volume is p hard both for the intersection of the h unit cube with a rational halfspace and for the convex hull of the regular v crosspolytope and an additional integer vector 4 there is a randomized algorithm for volume computation for v and h polytopes which runs in time that is polynomial in the input size and in 1 the lw ratio for a given polytope and a given frame is the ratio of two terms that involve volume computation hence it might seem natural to expect that the p hardness results for volume computation imply intractability results for lw constant computation to be more specific let in the sequel a 1 am qn 0 1 m q such that p x rn at 1 x 1 atmx m is an n dimensional polytope in rn with m facets f 1 fm since our problem is invariant under translations we can assume that 1 m 0 then j aj is the distance of fj from the origin while voln p q the facet volumes voln 1 fj need not be rational however since voln 1 fj n aj j voln conv 0 fj the normalized facet volumes j voln 1 fj aj j m are all rational using 5 we then have the following identity on the reverse loomis whitney inequality 15 remark 19 1 n m j 1 j j n 1 p f n i 1 1 2 m j 1 j uti aj therefore p f is the ratio of terms involving the normalized facet volumes of p hence from the knowledge of p fk for a suitable finite set of different frames fk fn one can in principle compute all normalized facet volumes through the corresponding system of multivariate polynomial equations along the lines of 27 hence voln p can be approximated up to any given precision 2 p p n this indicates that the computation of p fk for such frames should be p hard the situation seems however much less obvious if we just had an efficient algorithm for computing or approximating p it is in fact not clear at all how we could actually use the knowlege of p for volume computation or to solve any other p hard problem so it is conceivable that the task of computation the lw constant of v or h polytopes is easier than volume computation we conjecture however that this is not the case conjecture 20 the problem given a v polytope p or an h polytope respectively and a precision p n approximate p up to p binary digits is p hard it is also conceivable that lw constant computation is actually harder than volume compu tation in that not even randomization helps similarly to radii computations 14 15 there may exist a sequence of convex bodies kn kn for which the set of all frames that produce good approximations of kn has measure that decreases too quickly in the dimension n getting back to the deterministic case suppose now that we had an efficient algorithm at hand that would compute or closely approximate the volume of polytopes could we use this algorithm as a subroutine to compute p efficiently recall that by 5 and lemma 7 the computation of p could then be achieved by finding a rectangular box of minimal volume containing the zonotope p 1 2 m j 1 j aj aj as it turns out every zonotope is actually the projection body of a polytope lemma 21 let a 1 am rn 0 spanning rn and set z 1 2 m j 1 aj aj then there exists a polytope q with outer facet normals a 1 am such that z q proof let bj aj aj bn j aj aj j n j 1 2 aj j m 16 s campi p gritzmann and p gronchi then 2 m j 1 jbj 0 and we apply minkowski s theorem 50 compare also 51 and see 33 for an algorithmic version hence there exists a polytope q unique up to translation with facet outward unit normals b 1 b 2 m and corresponding facet volumes 1 2 m and we have q 1 2 2 m j 1 j bj bj 1 4 m j 1 aj aj 1 4 m j 1 aj aj 1 2 m j 1 aj aj z let us point out that lemma 21 does not claim that q is a rational polytope nevertheless we believe that the difficulty of the computation of p is not caused by that of volume computation alone but is also due to the intractability of the following problem boxcontzonotope given a 1 am qn and 0 q decide whether there exists a rectangular box b such that m j 1 aj aj b voln b conjecture 22 the problem boxcontzonotope is np hard note that conjecture 22 is related to a conjecture of 47 that the following problem is np complete given a point set v in rn does there exists a rigid motion such that v is contained in 1 1 n 6 2 fixed dimension now we turn to the case of fixed dimensions i e we assume that n is not part of the input but constant using the same notation as before let p be a rational polytope with facets f 1 fm of course as n is constant voln p and the normalized facet volumes 1 m can be computed in polynomial time with respect to exact computations the only parts of remark 19 that require attention are the terms uti aj note that the structural result of theorem 1 that relates best frames to the normals of p does not imply that there always exists a best frame that up to norm computations can be finitely encoded more precisely we have the following problem problem 23 given a rational polytope p do there exist integer vectors v 1 vn zn 0 such that v 1 v 1 vn vn is a best frame for p even if problem 23 would admit an affirmative answer the evaluation of p f will in general still need to involve approximations of norms in the following we will therefore resort to suitably specified approximations on the reverse loomis whitney inequality 17 first we give additive error bounds for projection average computation after a suitable scaling of p recall that is invariant under scaling more precisely we assume that 1 s p m j 1 voln 1 fj m j 1 j aj 1 1 n such a scaling can be done in polynomial time we begin with a technical lemma which shows that a tight rational approximation of the vectors of a frame f leads to a tight approximation of p f lemma 24 let 1 s p 1 1 n 0 1 and set 2 n enn further let f u 1 un fn and w 1 wn qn such that wi ui i n then p f 1 2 n n i 1 m j 1 j wti aj proof let zi wi ui i n then using the abbreviation 1 1 n we have for i n und j m j wti aj j uti aj j zti aj j uti aj j aj hence m j 1 j wti aj m j 1 j uti aj m j 1 j aj m j 1 j uti aj and therefore n i 1 m j 1 j wti aj n i 1 m j 1 j uti aj setting i m j 1 j uti aj i n the right hand side can be expressed in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials in 1 n i e n i 1 i n 1 n 1 2 n 2 n 1 n with k s n s k i s i k n 18 s campi p gritzmann and p gronchi since i m j 1 j uti aj m j 1 j aj it follows that k s n s k k n k k n k thus with 0 1 and 1 we have n i 1 i n n 1 i 0 i n 1 i n n 1 i 0 n i n i 1 n n n 1 i 0 ni n i 1 n nnn therefore we obtain 1 2 n n i 1 m j 1 j wti aj p f nnn 2 n p f en n 2 n p f which proves the first part of the assertion similarly for i n und j m j wti aj j uti aj j zti aj j uti aj j aj and n i 1 i n n 1 i 0 i n 1 i n n 1 i 0 i n 1 i hence the same arguments as before yield 1 2 n n i 1 m j 1 j wti aj 1 2 n n i 1 m j 1 j uti aj p f en n 2 n p f which proves the assertion lemma 24 shows that it is enough to approximate the vectors of a best frame by rational vectors up to some distance o in order to obtain the lw constant of p up to a given precision the algorithm for approximating lw constants will now be based on the structural results of theorem 1 augmented by a discrete approximate sampling of the set of all frames in order to take care of the remaining degrees of freedom on the reverse loomis whitney inequality 19 recall that according to theorem 1 with at most one exception the vectors of a best frame are parallel to facets of p thus in addition to the normalization and the orthogonality constraints we have the conditions j m atj u 1 0 j m atj un 1 0 a simple count shows that this still leaves 1 2 n 1 n 2 remaining degrees of freedom for each of the m n 2 m 1 o mn 1 minimal choices for the ui orthogonal to some aj each such potential choice is characterized by a subset r of n m of those pairs i j for which atj ui 0 let r denote the set of all such r the algorithm will perform o mn 1 steps of exhaustive search involving the remaining degrees of freedom the candidates for near best frames will be constructed successively in the ith step we construct a setwi of rational vectors wi of length close to 1 that are orthogonal to w 1 wi 1 and satisfy a t j wi 0 j ji for some ji m by theorem 1 we can assume that ji 6 for i n 1 the linear conditions in step i define a linear subspace xi of r n we use the following result from algorithmic linear algebra which is simply based on gauss elimination and gram schmidt orthogonalization see e g 59 remark 25 let xi be a q dimensional subspace of r n given as the solution of a system of linear equations with rational coefficients then there exist linearly independent vectors x 1 xq xi qn such that xtk xl 0 k l q k l 1 xk 2 k q such vectors can be found in polynomial time they will be referred to as a near normal or thogonal basis of xi next we construct the sets wi lemma 26 let 0 1 q and 2 nn ne 1 as in lemma 24 and set 2 n further let x 1 xq qn be a near normal orthogonal basis of xi and set wi w q k 1 kxk k z w 1 bn w 6 int bn then wi enn 1 2 n 3 q further for every vector u xi sn 1 there exists a w wi such that u w 20 s campi p gritzmann and p gronchi proof clearly wi is bounded from above by the number of points of the form q k 1 z 1 1 1 xk xk hence wi 2 1 1 q 4 n 1 12 nnne 1 q 8 enn 1 2 n q enn 1 2 n 3 q now for u xi sn 1 and k q let k 1 1 such that u ktxk bn for every positive t then u q k 1 k 0 xk 1 bn int bn by construction the box in xi on the left hand side contains a point w wi and we have u w 2 q which completes the proof the elements w w 1 wm w r w 1 w 2 wn 1 wn will be called pseudo frames and the corresponding term p w 1 2 n n i 1 m j 1 j wti aj will be referred to as pseudo average the algorithm structured search for approximating p and p in fixed dimen sion simply computes for each r r and each pseudo frame w w r the pseudo average p w and takes the minimum the number of pseudo average computations in each step depends on the specific set r r under consideration as general bounds we have dim xi n i i n 1 dim xn 1 from which we obtain the following result remark 27 w r enn 1 2 n 3 n 1 n 2 2 note that it would be enough to use only one representative of the class w 1 wn for each w 1 wm w r hence we could reduce the w r by a factor of 2 n on the reverse loomis whitney inequality 21 theorem 28 let 1 s p 1 1 n for a given bound 0 1 q we can compute a number with p p in time that is polynomial in size p and 1 proof we compute for each o mn 1 choices of r r the pseudo averages of p for all o n 1 n 2 2 elements in w r and take as the minimum it then follows from lemmas 24 and 26 that differs from p only by an additive term of recall that the above additive error depends on the scaling the following result uses the fact that p is invariant under scaling the running time of the algorithm depends however on the isoperimetric ratio of p corollary 29 see theorem 6 let n be fixed then given q with 0 an h polytope p with iso p and a bound 0 1 q a number with p 1 can be computed in time that is polynomial in size p 1 and 1 proof in polynomial time we can compute a dilatation factor such that 1 s p 1 1 n since p is invariant under scaling we will in the following assume that p itself already lies within these bounds i e 1 s p 1 1 n then we apply theorem 28 to compute for min 1 in polynomial time a number with p p and set voln p n 1 hence p voln p n 1 p p 1 p using the classical loomis whitney inequality 1 we obtain p 1 voln p n 1 1 s p n iso p since by our scaling s p n 1 this implies that p 1 iso p 1 iso p 1 on the other hand p voln p n 1 p voln p n 1 which proves the assertion 22 s campi p gritzmann and p gronchi note that by proposition 18 voln p and 1 m can be computed in polynomial time also a 1 am can be approximated efficiently hence we can compute an appropriate lower bound for iso p in polynomial time this bound enters the running time of the algorithm however directly rather than its binary size hence the algorithm is in general only pseudopolynomial in the input data and in 1 while the structural results of section 4 were used in structured search to reduce the number of projection average computations the characterization of theorem 1 is too weak to produce a combinatorial algorithm also the situation of the simplex shows that it is not likely that a much stronger characterization exists this is in accordance with a result of 52 which shows that for n 3 the one degree of freedom is governed by a polynomial of degree 6 which can be used to devise an o m 3 algorithm in the real ram model in that case 7 related functionals we now give some additional results which involve minimal rectangular boxes containing a given convex body we begin with the functional introduced in section 4 while for k k 2 we have k k the following result gives an inequality for general n lemma 30 for k kn we have k 1 n 1 k proof let f u 1 un be a frame such that k voln k voln b k f then k 1 n 1 voln k n i 1 voln 1 k u i 1 n 1 voln k n i 1 voln 1 b k f u i 1 n 1 voln k voln b k f k which concludes the proof a lower estimate of k is provided by the following lemma lemma 31 for every k kn k 1 n proof the proof proceeds by induction on n for n 2 the inequality is a consequence of the fact that 2 1 2 let the inequality be true now for every body in kn 1 let k be a convex body in rn let v sn 1 be parallel to a diameter of k and let d k be a segement of length diamk parallel to v further let b be a rectangular box in v containing the orthogonal projection of k onto v such that voln 1 b n 1 voln 1 k v we define the rectangular box b as the minkowski sum of b and d then b contains k and voln k 1 n diamk voln 1 k v 1 n diamk voln 1 b n 1 voln b n on the reverse loomis whitney inequality 23 replacing the volume voln by an intrinsic volume vi see e g 57 p 213 we obtain the functionals i k max f fn vi k vi b k f i n recall that voln vn hence n also up to a constant v 1 is the mean width and s 2 vn 1 let us point out that rather dealing with extrema of vi b k f as a function of f chakerian 21 and schneider 56 considered the mean value of such a function for 1 we can give additional results we begin with the analogue of proposition 8 and theorem 10 theorem 32 if p is a planar convex polygon then all rectangles of minimal perimeter containing p have at least one edge parallel to an edge of p proof let u cos sin without loss of generality suppose that the origin lies in the interior of p and consider the frames f f 2 of the form f u u 2 with 0 note that the perimeter of b p f is given by the function 2 hdp u 2 hdp u 2 where dp p p is the difference body of p we want to show that the minimum of is attained at some so that u or u 2 is parallel to some edge of p let p 1 p 2 ps be the vertices of dp then of course for u s 1 hdp u max i s utpi therefore is differentiable at and 2 unless there is an edge of dp whose outward unit normal is u or u 2 further whenever hdp is differentiable as a function of it is locally of the form et 1 pi cos e t 2 pi sin for some i s and therefore smooth let denote the set of all 0 for which is smooth for h dp hdp thus is also negative and therefore does not have a local minimum for hence any minimum of corresponds to a frame for which at least one direction is parallel to an edge of p in higher dimensions we can argue by induction as in the proof of theorem 10 to obtain the following result theorem 33 if p is a convex polytope in rn then a rectangular box containing p with minimal mean width has at most two opposite facets which contain just one point of p a functional which can be associated to 1 in a natural way is 1 k max f fn v 1 k n i 1 v 1 k u i by 20 for every n dimensional convex body k 1 k 1 n 1 24 s campi p gritzmann and p gronchi with equality if and only if k is a rectangular box and by 19 1 k 1 cn the following lemma is analogous to lemma 30 lemma 34 for every k kn we have 1 k n 1 1 k in the case of equality there exist a coordinate box b and a rotate kg of k such that kg e i b e i i n proof let g be a rotation such that kg admits a coordinate box b as a minimal mean width rectangular box then 1 k v 1 k g v 1 b n 1 v 1 k n i 1 v 1 b e i n 1 v 1 k n i 1 v 1 k g e i n 1 1 k the assertion for the equality case follows from the above chain of inequalities the upper bound of lemma 34 should be contrasted with the inequality 1 k 2 n 1 n of 21 where n voln b n which holds with equality if and only if v 1 b k f is indepen dent of f acknowledgement the authors
