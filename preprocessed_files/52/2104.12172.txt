that 3 m n 1 let q denote the largest area convex m gon contained in p we are interested in the minimum value of q p the ratio of the areas of these two polygons more precisely given positive integers n and m with 3 m n 1 define fn m min p pn max q p q m q p where the maximum is taken over all m gons contained in p and the mini mum is taken over pn the entire class of convex n gons the values of f 4 3 f 5 4 and f 6 3 are known in this paper we compute the values of f 5 3 f 6 5 and f 6 4 in addition we prove that for all n 6 we have 4 n sin 2 n 1 fn n 1 min 1 n 4 n sin 2 2 n these bounds can be used to improve the known estimates for fn m 1 introduction in 1940 sa s 11 proved the following theorem 1 1 let k be a compact convex body in the plane and let pm be the largest area m gon contained in k then 1 pm k m 2 sin 2 m where equality holds if and only if k is an ellipse throughout the paper denotes the area at about the same time fejes to th 5 proved an analogous theorem dealing with m gons containing k a few years later la za r 10 proved a result involving both polygons that contain k and polygons that are contained in k the following year john 9 published one of the major breakthroughs in the field of approximation of convex bodies john s ellipsoid theorem states that every d dimensional convex body k lies between two concentric homothetic ellipsoids whose ratio is no greater than d the results mentioned above have various applications to packing and covering problems as well as in the design of numerous geometric algorithms see 1 6 7 12 13 in 1992 motivated by a problem in robot motion planning fleischer mehlhorn rote welzl and yap 8 raised the following version of sa s problem question 1 given a convex n gon p and a positive integer m such that 3 m n 1 let q denote the largest area convex m gon contained in p how small can q p the ratio of the areas of these two polygons be 1 http arxiv org abs 2104 12172 v 1 more precisely given positive integers n and m with 3 m n 1 define fn m min p pn max q p q m q p where the maximum is taken over all m gons contained in p and the minimum is taken over pn the entire class of convex n gons it is easy to see that one can restrict the vertices of q to an m subset of the vertices of p there are just a few known values of fn m it is easy to see that f 4 3 1 2 indeed dividing a convex quadrilateral by a diagonal we get two triangles at least one of which has area greater or equal than half of the area of the quadrilateral on the other hand the case of parallelograms shows that the value 1 2 cannot be replaced by a larger one du and ding 2 3 proved that f 5 4 5 5 10 while fleischer et al 8 showed that f 6 3 4 9 to the best of our knowledge these are the only exact values of fn m known at this time in this paper we show that 2 f 5 3 1 5 f 6 4 2 3 and f 6 5 5 6 moreover we find the exact order of magnitude of fn n 1 by showing that for every n 6 3 4 n sin 2 n 1 fn n 1 min 1 n 4 n sin 2 2 n we use this inequality to prove that fn m m n for all n 1 m 5 1 1 the main technique throughout the entire paper we use the outer prod uct of two vectors to express areas this operation also known as exterior product is defined as follows for any two vectors v a b and u c d the outer product of v and u be given by v u 1 2 ad bc it is easy to see that the outer product represents the signed area of the triangle determined by the vectors v and u where the sign depends on whether the angle between v and u measured in the counterclockwise direction from v towards u is smaller than or greater than 180 the following properties of the outer product are simple consequences of the definition and are going to be used extensively in the remaining part of the paper 1 v u u v anticommutativity in particular v v 0 2 v u w v w u w linearity 2 setup for pentagons in this section we are going to prove that f 5 4 5 5 10 and f 5 3 1 5 as mentioned before the first result has already been proved in 2

dea eab 2 in the literature the triangles formed by three consecutive vertices of a convex polygon are sometimes called ears assumption 4 above fixes the ear of least area denote the intersection of ac and bd by o then define u od v oa after an appropriate scaling we may assume that u v aod 1 since a o and c are collinear and d o and b are collinear we can write bo a od au and co b oa bv with a b

the largest quadrilateral contained in the pentagon abcde it remains to prove the opposite inequality that is 8 abcd abcde 5 5 10 since abcde abcd dea 8 is equivalent to 9 dea abcde 5 5 10 2 5 5 since dea c d 1 and abcde a b c d ab relation 9 translates to 5 5 c d 1 2 a 2 b 2 c 2 d 2 ab that is 10 3 5 c d 5 5 2 a 2 b 2 ab to prove 10 we will proceed in two cases case 1 a 5 1 2 using 7 we have c d 1

results f 6 5 5 6 and f 6 4 2 3 let abcdef be an arbitrary convex hexagon suppose that the long di agonals ad be and cf are not concurrent if these diagonals do have a common point then perturb the position of one of the vertices by an arbitrarily small amount so that the diagonals are not concurrent anymore by continuity any inequality which is valid in the latter case is also valid in the former let m ad be n ad cf and p cf be denote u mn v mp as shown in figure 2 it follows that np v u after an appropriate scaling we may assume that mnp u v 1 since a m n d are collinear am au nd du

4 3 q 4 2 h we need to prove that at least one of t 1 t 2 t 3 and t 4 is nonnegative we split the proof into five different cases depending on the value of the second smallest element of a b c d e f case 1 a c min b d e f it follows that there exist nonnegative numbers xi i 1 5 such that c a x 1 b a x 1 x 2 d a x 1 x 3 e a x 1 x 4 f a x 1 x 5 substituting the above equalities into 14 17 18 and 19 we obtain that t 2 t 3 t 4 3 3 6 a 3 x 1 x 1 x 4 3 x 2 1 6 x 1 x 2 x 5 3 x 2 x 3 2 x 5 which is clearly nonnegative therefore at least one of the numbers t 2 t 3 t 4 is nonnegative case 2 a d min b c e f it follows that there exist nonnegative numbers xi i 1 5 such that d a x 1 b a x 1 x 2 c a x 1 x 3 e a x 1 x 4 f a x 1 x 5 substituting the above equalities into 14 16 18 and 19 we obtain that t 1 t 3 t 4 3 3 6 a 6 x 1 2 x 1 x 2 x 5 6 x 1 x 2 x 5 9 x 2 x 5 3 x 3 x 4 which is obviously nonnegative hence at least one of the numbers t 1 t 3 t 4 is nonnegative case 3 a e min b c d f in this case there exist nonnegative numbers xi i 1 5 such that e a x 1 b a x 1 x 2 c a x 1 x 3 d a x 1 x 4 f a x 1 x 5 substituting the above equalities into 14 16 17 and 18 we obtain that t 1 t 2 t 4 3 3 6 a 3 x 1 x 1 x 3 3 x 2 1 6 x 1 x 2 x 5 3 x 5 2 x 2 x 4 which is nonnegative it follows that at least one of the numbers t 1 t 2 t 4 is nonnegative case 4 a b min c d e f we investigate four separate subcases 9 subcase 4 i a b c min d e f in this case there exist nonnegative numbers xi i 1 5 such that b a x 1 c a x 1 x 2 d a x 1 x 2 x 3 e a x 1 x 2 x 4 f a x 1 x 2 x 5 substituting the above equalities into 14 16 and 18 we obtain that t 1 2 t 3 3 3 6 a 6 x 1 2 x 1 x 2 x 3 x 5 6 x 1 x 2 x 5 3 x 5 x 2 x 3 which is nonnegative thus at least one of t 1 and t 3 must be nonnegative subcase 4 ii a b d min c e f in this case there exist nonnegative numbers xi i 1 5 such that b a x 1 d a x 1 x 2 c a x 1 x 2 x 3 e a x 1 x 2 x 4 f a x 1 x 2 x 5 substituting the above equalities into 14 16 18 and 19 we obtain that t 1 t 3 t 4 3 3 6 a 6 x 1 2 x 1 x 2 x 5 6 x 1 x 2 x 5 3 x 2 x 5 3 x 3 x 4 which is nonnegative hence at least one of t 1 t 3 and t 4 must be nonnegative subcase 4 iii a b e min c d f in this case there exist nonnegative numbers xi i 1 5 such that b a x 1 e a x 1 x 2 c a x 1 x 2 x 3 d a x 1 x 2 x 4 f a x 1 x 2 x 5 substituting the above equalities into 14 16 17 and 19 we obtain that t 1 t 2 t 4 3 3 6 a 3 x 1 x 1 x 2 x 3 3 x 1 x 1 x 2 2 x 5 3 x 2 x 3 3 x 4 x 5 which is clearly nonnegative it follows that at least one of t 1 t 2 and t 4 must be nonnegative subcase 4 iv a b f min c d e in this case there exist nonnegative numbers xi i 1 5 such that b a x 1 f a x 1 x 2 c a x 1 x 2 x 3 d a x 1 x 2 x 4 e a x 1 x 2 x 5 substituting the above equalities into 14 17 and 19 we obtain that 2 t 2 t 4 3 3 6 a x 2 x 3 x 5 3 x 3 x 2 x 5 which is a sum of nonnegative numbers hence at least one of t 2 and t 4 must be nonnegative this completes the proof of case 4 case 5 a f min b c d e again we study four different subcases subcase 5 i a f b min c d e it follows that there exist nonnegative numbers xi i 1 5 such that f a x 1 b a x 1 x 2 c a x 1 x 2 x 3 d a x 1 x 2 x 4 e a x 1 x 2 x 5 substituting the above equalities into 14 17 and 19 we obtain that 2 t 2 t 4 3 3 6 a x 2 x 3 x 5 3 x 5 x 2 x 3 which is certainly nonnegative numbers it follows that either t 2 or t 4 is nonneg ative subcase 5 ii a f c min b d e in this case there exist nonnegative numbers xi i 1 5 such that f a x 1 c a x 1 x 2 b a x 1 x 2 x 3 d a x 1 x 2 x 4 e a x 1 x 2 x 5 substituting the above equalities into 14 17 18 and 19 we obtain that t 2 t 3 t 4 3 3 6 a 3 x 1 x 1 x 2 x 5 3 x 1 x 1 x 2 2 x 3 3 x 2 x 5 3 x 3 x 4 which is nonnegative hence at least one of t 2 t 3 t 4 must be nonnegative 10 subcase 5 iii a f d min b c e it follows that there exist nonnegative numbers xi i 1 5 such that f a x 1 d a x 1 x 2 b a x 1 x 2 x 3 c a x 1 x 2 x 4 e a x 1 x 2 x 5 substituting the above equalities into 14 16 18 and 19 we obtain that t 1 t 3 t 4 3 3 6 a 6 x 1 2 x 1 x 2 x 3 6 x 1 x 2 x 3 3 x 2 x 3 3 x 4 x 5 which is nonnegative hence at least one of t 1 t 3 t 4 must be nonnegative subcase 5 iv a f e min b c d in this case there exist nonnegative numbers xi i 1 5 such that f a x 1 e a x 1 x 2 b a x 1 x 2 x 3 c a x 1 x 2 x 4 d a x 1 x 2 x 5 substituting the above equalities into 14 16 and 18 we obtain that 2 t 1 t 3 3 3 6 a 6 x 1 2 x 1 x 2 x 3 x 5 6 x 1 x 2 x 3 3 x 3 x 2 x 5 which is nonnegative therefore at least one of t 1 and t 3 must be nonnegative which completes the analysis of case 5 and with it the proof of theorem 3 2 4 a closer look at fn n 1 as previously noticed finding the largest n 1 gon contained in a given convex n gon a 1 a 2 an is equivalent to finding the smallest ear of the original n gon define 20 gn max min 1 k n ak 1 akak 1 a 1 a 2 an where the maximum is taken over all convex n gons a 1 a 2 an clearly gn 1 fn n 1 theorems 2 1 and 3 1 can therefore be restated as g 5 5 5 10 and g 6 1 6 in general 21 gn 4 n sin 2 n as it can easily be seen by checking the case when the n gon is regular in this section we provide two upper bounds for gn the second of which shows that the order of magnitude of the lower bound in 21 is the correct one we will need the following simple lemma 4 1 let abcde be a convex pentagon in which dea min cde eab then dea min abd acd proof using equalities 6 we have c d 1 min b d bc a c ad which imply that c 1 and d 1 that is c d 1 1 on the other hand by 11 min abd acd min 1 a 1 b 1 the conclusion follows the following theorem was proved by du feng and tan 4 we present a different argument below theorem 4 2 4 for all n 4 we have 22 gn 1 gn 1 gn 11 proof let p a 1 a 2 anan 1 be an extremal convex n 1 gon for which 23 max q q is ann gon contained in p p fn 1 n 1 gn 1 without loss of generality we can assume thatq a 1 a 2 an that is anan 1 a 1 is the triangle of smallest area determined by three consecutive vertices of p de note anan 1 a 1 then 1 gn 1 fn 1 n q p q q q gn 1 1 gn 1 let r be the largest area n 1 gon contained in q clearly r is obtained by re moving fromq one of the following n triangles a 1 a 2 a 3 a 2 a 3 a 4 an 2 an 1 an an 1 ana 1 or ana 1 a 2 each of the first n 2 triangles has area this is because these triangles are ears of p and we assumed that anan 1 a 1 is the smallest area ear of p in particular anan 1 a 1 min an 1 anan 1 an 1 a 1 a 2 using lemma 4 1 for the convex pentagon abcde a 1 a 2 an 1 anan 1 it follows that anan 1 a 1 min an 1 ana 1 ana 1 a 2 this proves that each of the trianglesa 1 a 2 a 3 a 2 a 3 a 4 an 2 an 1 an an 1 ana 1 ana 1 a 2 have area it follows that r q from which 1 gn fn n 1 r q 1 q 1 gn 1 1 gn 1 comparing the first and last terms in the inequality chain above implies 22 as claimed corollary 4 3 a for every n 6 gn 1 fn n 1 1 n 24 b for every m n such that 5 m n fn m m n 25 proof we proved in theorem 3 1 then f 6 5 5 6 so the first statement is true for n 6 using inequality 22 it follows by induction that gn 1 n as claimed in particular fn n 1 n 1 n for all n 6 for proving the second part given 5 m n let pn be an extremal convex n gon for which 26 max q q is anm gon contained in pn pn fn m consider a finite sequence of convex polygons pn 1 pn 2 pm 1 pm con structed as follows for each m k n 1 pk is the convex k gon obtained by removing the smallest area ear of pk 1 it follows that pk pk 1 fk 1 k and therefore by using part a we obtain fn m pm pn n 1 k m pk pk 1 n 1 k m fk 1 k n 1 k m k k 1 m n 12 in particular f 7 5 5 7 0 714 improving the bound f 7 5 5 10 5 0 644 due to du and ding 2 inequalities 21 and 24 provide bounds for gn however the upper bound is rather weak as we expect that gn n 3 we prove that this is indeed the case theorem 4 4 for every n 4 gn 4 n sin 2 2 n proof by a celebrated result of john 9 it is known that every convex polygon lies between two concentric homothetic ellipses of ratio 2 see figure 3 after an appropriate affine transformation t these ellipses are mapped into a pair of concentric circles c and 2 c since such a transformation preserves ratios it would be sufficient to prove that the result holds for the polygon t p a 1 a 2 an a 1 a 2 a 3 an 2 an 1 an ln l 1 l 2 l 3 ln 1 ln 2 c 2 c figure 3 a convex polygon lying between two concentric cir cles c and 2 c 13 denote the lengths of the sides a 1 a 2 a 2 a 3 ana 1 by l 1 l 2 ln respectively and denote by l l 1 l 2 ln the perimeter of a 1 a 2 an we have that n k 1 4 2 ak 1 akak 1 n k 1 4 lklk 1 4 sin ak n k 1 lklk 1 1 2 n k 1 sin ak 1 2 n k 1 lk lk 1 2

sinx on the interval 0 it follows that min 1 k n ak 1 akak 1 l 2 sin 2 n 2 n 2 and after dividing by a 1 a 2 an 27 min 1 k n ak 1 akak 1 l 2 sin 2 n 2 n 2 the polygon a 1 a 2 an contains a circle of radius r hence its area is at least as large as the area of the regular n gon circumscribed about a circle of radius r that is 28 nr 2 tan n on the other hand the polygon a 1 a 2 an is contained in a circle of radius 2 r hence its perimeter is no greater than the perimeter of the regular n gon inscribed in a circle of radius 2 r that is 29 l 4 nr sin n combining 27 28 and 29 we obtain min 1 k n ak
