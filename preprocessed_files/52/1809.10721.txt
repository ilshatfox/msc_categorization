dense packings with nonparallel cylinders dan ismailescu and piotr laskawiec hofstra university abstract a cylinder packing is a family of congruent infinite circular cylinders with mutually disjoint interiors in 3 dimensional euclidean space the local density of a cylinder packing is the ratio between the volume occupied by the cylinders within a given sphere and the volume of the entire sphere the global density of the cylinder packing is obtained by letting the radius of the sphere approach infinity it is known that the greatest global density is obtained when all cylinders are parallel to each other and each cylinder is surrounded by exactly six others in this case the global density of the cylinder packing equals 12 0 90689 the question is how large a density can a cylinder packing have if one imposes the restriction that no two cylinders are parallel in this paper we prove two results first we show that there exist cylinder packings with no two cylinders parallel to each other whose local density is arbitrarily close to the local density of a packing with parallel cylinders second we construct a cylinder packing with no two cylinders parallel to each other whose global density is 1 2 this improves the results of k kuperberg c graf and p paukowisch 1 introduction let l be a line in 3 dimensional space and let r be a positive real number the set of points in r 3 whose distance from l is not greater than r is called the infinite circular cylinder or just the cylinder for short of axis l and radius r two cylinders are parallel if their axes are parallel a collection of congruent cylinders whose interiors are mutually disjoint is called a cylinder packing given a cylinder packing c ci i 1 one may inquire what portion of the space is occupied by the cylinders in c this question naturally leads to the concepts of local density and global density of c defined below let b r be the ball of radius r centered at the origin then the local density of c with respect to b r denoted c r is the ratio between the volume within b r that is covered by the cylinders and the volume of b r more formally c r i 1 v ol ci b r 4 r 3 3 the global density of c denoted c is simply c lim r c r provided the limit exits one may ask what is the greatest possible value of c in lay terms what is the most efficient way to pack congruent cylinders in space 1 ar x iv 1 80 9 10 72 1 v 1 m at h m g 2 7 s ep 2 01 8 under the restriction that all cylinders are parallel the problem is equivalent to finding the maximum density of a packing of the plane with congruent circles one can easily see this by writing r 3 as the union of the planes perpendicular to the cylinders axes the planar problem was solved by thue 7 who proved that the most efficient way to pack congruent circles in the plane is to arrange them such that each circle is tangent to six others see figure 1 figure 1 the densest packing of congruent circles in the plane has density 12 the density of such arrangement is given by the ratio between the area of a circle and the area of the regular circumscribed hexagon and it equals 12 0 90689 it follows that if all cylinders are parallel then c 12 can one do better this disarmingly simple question remained unsolved until 1990 when a bezdek and w kuperberg proved in 2 that the answer is negative theorem 1 1 2 the maximum global density of any space packing with congruent cylinders is 12 this result is significant because this was the first example of a solid that does not tile the space and whose maximum packing density was explicitly determined this prompted moser and pach to raise the following challenge problem 1 2 6 find nontrivial examples of bounded convex bodies in r 3 that are not tiles but whose maximum packing density can be computed exactly a first answer was provided by bezdek 1 who determined the maximum packing density of a rhombic dodecahedron that has one corner removed so that it no longer tiles the space in this case the packing density equals the ratio of the volume of the truncated rhombic dodecahedron to the volume of the full rhombic dodecahedron a few years later hales settled a long standing conjecture of kepler regarding the maximum packing density of the sphere hales showed that this value equals 18 0 7404 hales s proof relies heavily on computers and for this particular reason a certain level of uncertainty about the validity of the proof lingered within the mathematical community in order to remove any such doubts hales embarked on a 15 year collaborative project to produce a complete formal proof of the kepler conjecture 2 in january 2015 hales and 21 collaborators submitted a paper titled a formal proof of the kepler conjecture 4 to arxiv claiming to have proved the conjecture in 2017 the paper appeared in print in the forum of mathematics journal returning to the cylinder case it is not obvious at first glance whether there exists a cylinder packing that does not contain two parallel cylinders but has positive density under the restriction that no two cylinders are parallel one might expect that the cylinders need so much room to avoid each other that in effect the packing density always turns out to be zero surprisingly this is not true a subtle construction of k kuperberg 5 produces a cylinder packing with density 2 576 0 017 in which no two cylinders are parallel her construction was refined by graf and paukowitsch 3 who obtained a nonparallel cylinder packing with density 5 12 0 4166 in this paper we prove two results first we show that there exist cylinder packings with no two cylinders parallel whose local density is arbitrarily close to the local density of a cylinder packing with parallel cylinders second we construct a nonparallel cylinder packing whose global density is 1 2 thus improving graf s and paukowitch s result 2 a local result for any cylinder packing in space there exists a plane which intersects the axes of all the cylinders this is because the number of cylinders in any packing is countable and therefore so is the number of unit vectors representing the directions of their axes since the unit sphere cannot be expressed as a countable union of great circles one can select a unit vector which is not orthogonal to any of these direction vectors then any plane having that vector as its normal vector will have the desired property thus every cylinder packing can be constructed in the following manner step 1 start with a point set a in the xy plane step 2 through each point a a construct a line l r 3 step 3 consider the cylinders of radius r whose axes are the lines constructed in step 2 if the distance between any two such lines is 2 r then the resulting collection of cylinders is a packing let a a 1 a 2 an be a set of points in the xy plane such that the distance between any two distinct points of a is at least 2 r where r 0 is given for each ai a let l i be the line passing through ai and perpendicular to the xy plane further let c i r be the cylinder of radius r whose axis is l i then c i r is a cylinder packing with all cylinders parallel to each other for any r 0 denote the local density of this packing by 1 a r r a i 1 v ol c i r b r 4 r 3 3 where b r is the ball of radius r centered at the origin for every ai a a 6 o let li be the image of l i under a rotation around the axis oai note that irrespective of the rotation angle li is also perpendicular to oai 3 for some 0 r let ci be the cylinder of radius having line li as its axis under the assumption that the distance between any two lines li and lj is at least 2 then ci is also a cylinder packing denote the local density of this new packing by 2 a r a i 1 v ol ci b r 4 r 3 3 what we intend to prove is that the lines li can be chosen is such a way that no two cylinders in ci are parallel and the local density a r is not too much smaller than the local density of the parallel packing a r r this will be made precise in the sequel we start with a lemma 2 1 let r 0 r 0 be two fixed positive reals consider a 1 x 1 y 1 0 and a 2 x 2 y 2 0 two distinct points in the xy plane such that a 1 a 2 2 r let o 0 0 0 be the origin and denote oa 1 d 1 oa 2 d 2 assume that 0 d 1 r and 0 d 2 r for i 1 2 let li be the line passing through ai and having direction vector vi yi xi t where t is chosen such that 8 r 2 t r 4 then the lines l 1 and l 2 are not parallel and the distance between them is at least 3 dist l 1 l 2 2 r 1 1 t proof note first that the angles formed by the lines l 1 l 2 with the xy plane are arctan t d 1 and arctan t d 2 respectively so if d 1 6 d 2 the lines cannot be parallel if d 1 d 2 then v 1 v 2 and under the assumption that l 1 l 2 we immediately obtain that v 1 v 2 but this then leads to a 1 a 2 contradiction hence the lines cannot be parallel we denote by c the cosine of the angle determined by the vectors oa 1 and oa 2 c cos a 1 oa 2 note that c oa 1 oa 2 oa 1 oa 2 x 1 x 2 y 1 y 2 d 1 d 2 from which x 1 x 2 y 1 y 2 c d 1 d 2 also by the law of cosines a 1 a 2 2 d 21 d 2 2 2 d 1 d 2 cos a 1 oa 2 d 2 1 d 2 2 2 cd 1 d 2 it is well known that the distance between two skew lines can be computed with the formula 4 dist l 1 l 2 a 1 a 2 v 1 v 2 v 1 v 2 we will express the numerator and denominator separately for the numerator we have a 1 a 2 v 1 v 2 x 2 x 1 y 2 y 1 0 y 1 x 1 t y 2 x 2 t t x 2 x 1 y 2 y 1 y 2 x 2 t x 2 x 1 y 2 y 1 y 1 x 1 t x 21 y 2 1 x 2 2 y 2 2 2 x 1 x 2 2 y 1 y 2 t d 21 d 2 2 2 oa 1 oa 2 t d 21 d 2 2 2 d 1 d 2 cos a 1 oa 2 t a 1 a 2 2 5 4 computing the denominator it follows that v 1 v 2 2 v 1 2 v 2 2 v 1 v 2 2 d 21 t 2 d 22 t 2 x 1 x 2 y 1 y 2 t 2 2 d 21 t 2 d 22 t 2 c d 1 d 2 t 2 2 d 21 d 2 2 d 2 1 t 2 d 22 t 2 t 4 c 2 d 21 d 2 2 2 cd 1 d 2 t

first result theorem 2 2 let r r be positive real numbers and let a be a point set in the xy plane such that the distance between any two points in a is at least 2 r and a is contained in the ball of radius r centered at the origin then for every 0 8 r 2 r 4 there exists a collection of congruent cylinders ci all of radius r 1 with the following properties a the axis of ci passes through ai a b no two cylinders are parallel c every two cylinders have disjoint interiors d a r 1 r a r 1 r proof use lemma 2 1 with t 1 for each ai xi yi 0 a consider the line li which passes through ai and has direction vector vi yi xi 1 also recall that l i is the line passing through ai and has direction vector 0 0 1 note that both li and l i are perpendicular to oai let ci and c i be the cylinders of radius r 1 having axes li and l i respectively parts b and c follow immediately from lemma 2 1 for proving part d note that ci b r and c i b r are congruent as solids in r 3 as they can be obtained from each other via a rotation having oai as its 5 axis since both ci and c i are packings it follows that a i 1 v ol ci b r a i 1 v ol c i b r dividing both sides by the volume of b r part d follows theorem 2 2 states that for given r and r positive numbers if one starts with a packing of parallel cylinders of radius r then one can first replace each of these cylinders with a cylinder of radius r 1 and then rotate these thinner cylinders slightly such that no two of the perturbed cylinders are parallel the resulting arrangement is still a packing and the local density with respect to b r is the same as the local density of the packing with thinner parallel cylinders note that in our construction the direction vectors of the axes of the nonparallel cylinders depend on r the radius of the circle centered at the origin that contains the set a indeed must be no greater than 8 r 2 r 4 for the construction to work hence the implicit assumption is that set a is bounded if we want to produce a cylinder packing with high global density the set a has to be unbounded and therefore we must use a different approach we will present such a construction in the next section 3 an infinite packing with density 1 2 let d r be the disk in r 2 of radius r and centered at the origin definition 3 1 let a be a set of points in the plane the point density of a is defined as 7 a r lim r a d r r 2 provided the limit exists we next consider a special point set in the xy plane which we will also denote by a for every positive integer d 32 let m be the unique integer such that 2 m d 2 m 1 define 2 6 2 m 3 2 m and ad d cos k d sin k 0 k 1 2 6 2 m finally set 8 a d 32 ad lemma 3 2 the distance between any two distinct points of a is at least 1 and its point density regarded as a subset of r 2 equals 2 proof let a 1 a 2 be two distinct points in a denote d 1 oa 1 d 2 oa 2 if d 1 6 d 2 then a 1 a 2 d 2 d 1 1 follows from the triangle inequality and the fact that d 1 and d 2 are integers if d 1 d 2 then a 1 oa 2 3 2 m where m is the positive integer for which 2 m d 1 d 2 2 m 1 it follows that a 1 a 2 2 d 1 sin 3 2 m 1 2 m 1 sin 3 2 m 1 1 6 figure 2 150 d 32 ad as a subset of the set a since the function x sin 3 x is strictly increasing and already for x 2 it takes value 1 let m 5 be an integer and let d 2 m be the disk with center o and radius 2 m the cardinality of the set a d 2 m is equal to 6 322 6 642 6 2 m 1 2 6 2 m 6 210 212 22 m 2 2 m 22 m 1 6 2 m 211 hence the point density of a equals lim m 22 m 1 6 2 m 211 22 m 2 3 1 the construction fix a real constant l 6 and define k l 2 1 note that 9 l 2 k 2 1 03 and k l 2 k the exact value of l is not important as long as inequalities 9 are satisfied the reason for these choices of l and k is going to become clear soon for a given point ai xi yi 0 a we denote di oai x 2 i y 2 i let l i be the line that passes through ai and is orthogonal to the xy plane we associate with ai another line li in the following way the line li passes through ai the direction of li is given by the vector vi yi xi kdi l the selection of the direction vectors is the critical part of the construction let us look at our choice for vi a bit more closely 7 first notice that vi oai 0 so li is obtained by rotating l i around ai in the plane that passes through ai and is orthogonal to oai second let di be the tangent function of the angle formed by the line li with the xy plane then 10 di kdi l x 2 i y 2 i kdi l di k l di hence di gets smaller as di increases in particular for any two distinct points ai aj a such that di dj we have di dj this means that lines li and lj cannot be parallel also if ai and aj are two distinct points in a with di dj then it is still impossible for li and lj to be parallel indeed in this case vi vj which implies vi vj that is yi xi kdi l yj xj kdj l but this forces ai aj contradiction at this point we have the lines li no two of which are parallel these lines are going to be the axes of the cylinders in the packing we are planning to construct the delicate part is to prove a lower bound for the distance between any two such lines our choice of the set a is very similar to those in kuperberg 5 and graf and paukowitsch 3 papers although our set has higher point density also in both those papers d is a strictly decreasing function of d kuperberg takes 2 1 3 to be some strictly decreasing function of d such that 2 3 and lim d d 1 so the lines intersecting the xy plane close to the origin form angles of about 60 with the xy plane and this angle decreases to about 45 for lines intersecting the xy plane far from the origin next kuperberg proves that the distance between any two lines is at least 8 3 0 226 and shows that this eventually leads to a cylinder packing of density 2 576 0 0171 graf and paukowitsch select their d 2 0896 arctan d for d 1 for this explicit choice of d they prove that the distance between any two lines is at least 1 which is optimal and then present a cylinder packing with density 5 12 0 4166 while this result is much better than kuperberg s original estimate their choice of the function d leads to some awkward computations which require heavy use of complicated taylor series estimates on the other hand our definition 10 of d generates much simpler algebra and eventually helps us produce a better result we will need the following result later on lemma 3 3 let l 6 be a fixed real number and let k l 2 1 then for every x 32 the following inequality holds true 11 1 cos 3 x 1 03 x 1 2 2 x 4 l 2 k 2 x 1 2 2 x 4 proof consider the function 12 x 2 x 4 x 1 2 1 cos 3 x 8 it is easy to show that x is increasing for x 32 and that lim x x 2 9 1 0966 substituting x 32 we get 32 1 03017 as claimed the second inequality is an immediate consequence of 9 3 2 a lower bound for the distance between two lines we will next study the most critical part of our construction namely providing a lower estimate for the distance between any two lines lemma 3 4 let a 1 x 1 y 1 0 and a 2 x 2 y 2 0 be two distinct points in a as defined in 8 for i 1 2 let di x 2 i y 2 i and vi yi xi kdi l with l k satisfying 9 for i 1 2 let li ai tvi be the line passing through point ai and having direction vector vi then 13 dist l 1 l 2 1 proof note the result above is optimal as there are infinitely many pairs of points a 1 a 2 in a with a 1 a 2 1 a key role in the sequel is played by the cosine of the angle determined by the vectors oa 1 and oa 2 thus we introduce the following notation c cos a 1 oa 2 note that 14 c oa 1 oa 2 oa 1 oa 2 x 1 x 2 y 1 y 2 d 1 d 2 from which x 1 x 2 y 1 y 2 c d 1 d 2 again we use the formula that gives the distance between two nonparallel lines in space 15 dist l 1 l 2 a 1 a 2 v 1 v 2 v 1 v 2 as before we will compute the numerator and denominator separately for the numerator we have a 1 a 2 v 1 v 2 x 2 x 1 y 2 y 1 0 y 1 x 1 kd 1 l y 2 x 2 kd 2 l kd 1 l x 2 x 1 y 2 y 1 y 2 x 2 kd 2 l x 2 x 1 y 2 y 1 y 1 x 1 kd 1 l x 22 y 2 2 x 1

d 2 2 2 1 c d 1 d 2 k 2 1 d 1 d 2 l 2 kl d 1 d 2 l 2 d 2 d 1 2 and taking into account that k 2 1 l 2 we end up with 17 v 1 v 2 2 1 c 2 d 21 d 2 2 2 1 c d 1 d 2 l 2 1 d 1 d 2 kl d 1 d 2 l 2 d 2 d 1 2 since we intend to show that a 1 a 2 v 1 v 2 v 1 v 2 it is natural to consider the difference a 1 a 2 v 1 v 2 2 v 1 v 2 2 using equalities 16 and 17 we obtain 1 c 2 d 21 d 2 2 kd 1 kd 2 2 l 2 2 1 c d

this is indeed the case since for any point ai a the distance oai di is a positive integer hence l 2 d 2 d 1 2 d 2 d 1 2 1 0 and obviously 1 kd 1 kd 2 2 l 2 k 2 d 1 d 2 2 and 1 c 0 from which it immediately follows that 1 c 2 d 21 d 2 2 k 2 d 1 d 2 2 2 1 c d 1 d 2 kl d 1 d 2 d 2 d 1 2 1 l 2 2 d 22 5 d 1 d 2 2 d 2 1 1 the right hand side becomes 0 if 1 c 0 and therefore in this case 0 done assume that c 1 and let be the quantity obtained after dividing the right hand term by 2 1 c d 1 d 2 19 k 2 2 1 c d 1 d 2 d 1 d 2 2 kl d 1 d 2 d 2 d 1 2 1 l 2 2 d 22 5 d 1 d 2 2 d 2 1 1 we plan to prove that 0 clearly is symmetric in respect to d 1 and d 2 so we can assume without loss of generality that d 1 d 2 we also know that there exists an m 5 such that 2 m d 2 2 m 1 10 we will now prove the following statement 20 1 c l 2 k 2 d 2 1 2 2 d 42 since 2 m d 2 2 m 1 it follows by our choice of the set a that a 1 oa 2 3 2 m 3 d 2 from which 1 c 1 cos 3 2 m 1 cos 3 d 2 l 2 k 2 d 2 1 2 2 d 42 where the second inequality is due to the fact that the function 1 cos 1 x is a decreasing function and the third inequality follows from lemma 3 3 with x d 2 and thus 20 is true looking at we can see that the first term is clearly non negative and so we can plug in the lower bound we obtained in 20 to get k 2 2 l 2 k 2 d 2 1 2 2 d 42 d 1 d 2 d 1 d 2 2 kl d 1 d 2 d 2 d 1 2 1 l 2 2 d 22 5 d 1 d 2 2 d 2 1 1 we know that d 1 d 2 and since these are integers there exists a nonnegative integer n so that d 2 d 1 n next we substitute this expression into our inequality and simplify to obtain the following lower bound for 21 l 2 d 1 n 1 2 d 1 2 d 1 n 2 4 d 1 n 3 kl 2 d 1 n n 2 1 l 2 2 d 21 5 d 1 d 1 n 2 d 1 n 2 1 clearly if we show that 21 is nonnegative then so is multiply 21 by 4 d 1 n 3 as that does not change the sign of the expression after factoring and tidying up the expression we are left with a quartic polynomial in d 1 8 kn 2 4 ln 8 k 8 l d 41 28 kn 3 3 ln 2 28 kn 16 ln d 31 36

would suffice to prove that the coefficients of the above polynomial are nonnegative for all n 0 indeed we have 32 3 n 2 32 3 28 n 56 n 32 3 n 28 56 32 3 0 112 3 n 3 112 3 n 21 n 2 112 n n 112 3 n n 1

3 16 3 n n 2 1 56 n 2 28 0 now it is clear that the whole expression is nonnegative thus 0 and the proof is complete 11 we are now ready to prove the main result of this paper theorem 3 6 there exists a cylinder packing c whose global density is 1 2 and no two cylinders in c are parallel proof consider the set a as defined in 8 for each point ai xi yi 0 a define two lines as follows l i ai 0 0 1 t and li ai yi xi kdi l t where di x 2 i y 2 i l 7 and k 4 3 let c i and ci be the cylinders of radius 1 2 whose axes are l i and li respectively then clearly c i is a packing with parallel cylinders while by lemma 3 4 ci is also a cylinder packing but no two cylinders are parallel to each other moreover since for every r 0 we have that b r c i and b r ci are congruent it follows that c i r ci r and after letting r the global densities of the two cylinder packings are also equal to each other 22 c i ci but it is easy to see that the density of c i can be expressed as the product of the point density of a which by lemma 3 2 equals 2 and the area of the perpendicular cross section of a cylinder in c i hence the global density of c i equals 23 c i 2 1 2 2 1 2 combining the last two equalities we obtain the desired result 4 conclusions and directions for future study we constructed a cylinder packing with global density 1 2 with no two cylinders being parallel the natural question is whether we can do better in fact k kuperberg 5 conjectured that there exist such packings with density arbitrarily close to 12 in light of our result in theorem 2 2 this may very well be the case the weak part of our proof is the choice of the point set a this set has point density of only 2 0 6366 in comparison the point set 24 m 2 n 3 2 m n even m n integers has point density 2 3 1 1647 and the minimum distance between any two points of is still equal to 1 of course is the unit equilateral triangle lattice hence by thue s result it is the densest planar point set with this property 12 so why not use instead ofa the answer is simple for every point ai a the distance di oai is an integer this is not the case with the lattice we used this fact in estimating the quantity defined in 18 see also observation 3 5 to be precise the term l 2 d 2 d 1 2 d 2 d 1 2 1 is always nonnegative if di are all integers this allowed us to ignore this term altogether and in the process reduce the problem to a linear inequality in 1 c see the step that lead to the definition of in 19 but of course if we choose instead of a l 2 d 2 d 1 2 d 2 d 1 2 1 could very well be negative and then showing that 0 becomes a quadratic inequality in 1 c not only is this inequality more difficult to work with but several computer experiments indicated that it may not even be true one final remark regarding our cylinder packing the angle formed by the line li with the xy plane is arctan k l di this means that lines that intersect the xy plane closest to the origin have slopes of k l 32 while the lines that intersect the xy plane far from the origin have slopes close to k once l and therefore k is fixed this creates a cone having oz as its axis which is completely free of any cylinders in other words there are arbitrarily large holes in our packing we measure the size of the hole by the radius of the largest sphere that can fit in that region one interesting question is whether a nonparallel cylinder packing exists all of its holes being of bounded size references 1 andra s bezdek a remark on the packing density in the 3 space intuitive geometry szeged 1991 17 22
