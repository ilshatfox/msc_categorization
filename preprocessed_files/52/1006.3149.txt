catalan solids pentagonal icositetrahedron and pentagonal hexacontahedron in this paper we construct the chiral polyhedra and their dual solids in a systematic way we use the proper rotational subgroups of the coxeter groups to derive the orbits representing the solids of interest they lead to the polyhedra tetrahedron icosahedron snub cube and snub dodecahedron respectively we prove that the tetrahedron and icosahedron can be transformed to their mirror images by the proper rotational octahedral group 1 1 1 3 3 3 w and w h w a a a w a b 3 w b c 2 so they are not classified in the class of chiral polyhedra it is noted that vertices of the snub cube and snub dodecahedron can be derived from the vectors which are linear combinations of the simple roots by the actions of the proper rotation groups 3 2 w b c and 3 2 w h c respectively their duals are constructed as the unions of three orbits of the groups of concern we also construct the polyhedra quasiregular in general by combining chiral polyhedra with their mirror images as a by product we obtain the pyritohedral group as the subgroup the coxeter group and discuss the constructions of pyritohedrons we employ a method which describes the coxeter groups and their orbits in terms of quaternions 3 w h a electronic mail kocam squ edu om b electronic mail nazife squ edu om c electronic mail m 054946 squ edu om 1

quasi crystallographic materials 4 chirality is a very interesting topic in molecular chemistry and physics a number of molecules display one type of chirality they are either left oriented or right oriented molecules in fundamental physics chirality plays very important role for example a massless dirac particle has to be either in the left handed state or in the right handed state no lorentz transformation exist transforming one state to the other state the weak interactions which is described by the standard model of high energy physics is invariant under one type of chiral transformations in three dimensional euclidean space which will be the topic of this paper the chirality is defined as follows the object which can not be transformed to its mirror image by other than the proper rotations and translations are called chiral objects for this reason the chiral objects lack the plane and or central inversion symmetry in two previous papers we have constructed the vertices of the platonic archimedean solids 5 and the dual solids of the archimedean solids the catalan solids 6 using the quaternionic representations of the rank 3 coxeter groups two of the 13 archimedean solids the snub cube and snub dodecahedron are the chiral polyhedra whose symmetries are the proper rotational subgroups of the octahedral group and the icosahedral group respectively in this paper we use a similar technique of references 5 6 to construct the vertices of the chiral archimedean solids snub cube snub dodecahedron and their duals they have been constructed by employing several techniques 7 8 but it seems that the method in what follows has not been studied earlier in this context we follow a systematic method for the construction of the chiral polyhedra first we begin with the coxeter diagrams which lead to the tetrahedron and icosahedron respectively and prove that they possess larger proper rotational symmetries which transform them to their mirror images so that they are not chiral solids we organize the paper as follows in sec 2 we construct the coxeter groupsw 1 1 1 and a a a a 3 1 1 1 a a a 3 w a 3 w b and in terms of quaternions in sec 3 we obtain the proper rotation subgroup of the coxeter group and determine the vertices of the tetrahedron by imposing some conditions on the general vector expressed in terms of simple roots of the diagram we prove that the tetrahedron can be transformed to its mirror image by the proper octahedral rotation group 3 w h 1 1 w a a a 1 1 a a 1 1 a 3 2 c w b in sec 4 we discuss similar problem for the coxeter dynkin diagram leading to an icosahedron and again prove that it can be transformed by the group 3 a 3 w b 2 c to its mirror image which indicates that neither tetrahedron nor icosahedron are chiral solids here we also discuss the properties of the pyritohedral group and the constructions of the pyritohedrons the sec 5 deals with the construction of the snub cube and its dual pentagonal icositetrahedron from the proper rotational octahedral symmetry 3 2 c w b using the same technique employed in sec 3 and sec 4 in sec 6 we repeat a similar work for the constructions of the snub dodecahedron and its dual pentagonal hexacontahedron from the proper icosahedral group 3 2 5 w h c a which is isomorphic to the group of even permutations of five 2 letters in the concluding sec 7 we point out that our technique can be extended to determine the chiral polyhedra in higher dimensions 2 construction of the groups 1 1 1 3 3 3 w and w h w a a a w a b in terms of quaternions let be a real unit quaternion with its conjugate defined by iieqqq 0 321 i 0 i iq q q e and the norm 1 qq qq the quaternionic imaginary units satisfy the relations i j ij ijk ke e e 321 kji 1 where ij and ijk

notations for the rotary reflections and the proper rotations will be p q and p q respectively where and p q are arbitrary quaternions the coxeter group is generated by three commutative group

shorthand notation could be 3 w b t t t t t t t t note that we have three maximal subgroups of the octahedral group namely the tetrahedral group the chiral octahedral group consisting of the elements

of five letters note also that the pyritohedral group is a maximal subgroup of the coxeter groupw h all finite subgroups of the groups o in terms of quaternions can be found in reference 12 3 3 an 4 od a general vector in the dual space is represented by the vector 1 1 2 2 3 3 1 2 3 a a a a a a we will use the notation o w 1 2 3 g o a a a for the orbit of the coxeter groupw g generated from the vector where the letter g represents the coxeter diagram we follow the dynkin notation to represent an arbitrary vector in the dual space and drop the basis vectors 1 2 3 a a a 1 2 3 i i in the lie algebraic representation theory the components of the vector are called the dynkin indices 13 which are non negative integers if it represents the highest weight vector here we are not restricted to the integer values of the dynkin indices they can be any real number when the components of the vector in the dual space are non integers 1 2 3 a a a 6 values we will separate them by commas otherwise no commas will be used for an arbitrary coxeter diagram of rank 3 we define the fundamental orbits as 1 2 3 100 010 and 001 o o o o o o 18 any linear combination of the basis vectors i over the real numbers will in general lead to quasi regular polyhedra under the action of the coxeter group in the next four sections we discuss a systematic construction of chiral polyhedra and their dual solids in our construction tetrahedron and icosahedron will also occur but we prove that they are not chiral polyhedra 3 the orbit as tetrahedron 2 2 1 2 3 o c c a a a the proper rotation subgroup of the coxeter group 1 1 1 w a a a applies on an arbitrary vector 1 1 2 2 3 3 1 2 a e a e a e as follows 1 2 1 1 2 2 3 3 1 2 r r a e a e a e 2 3 1 1 2 2 3 3 1 2 r r a e a e a e 3 1 1 1 2 2 3 3 1 2 r r a e a e a e to obtain a tetrahedron from these four vertices the dynkin indices should satisfy the relations 19 2 2 2 21 2 3 1 2 3 ia a a a a a i we take 2 1 a and start with a vector 1 2 3 1 2 i e e e then the orbit o will be given by i 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 io e e e e e e e e e e e e 20 the tetrahedron with these vertices is shown in fig 5 figure 5 the tetrahedron with the vertices given in equation 20 7 these are the vertices of a tetrahedron invariant under the rotation group given in 8 of course the full symmetry of the tetrahedron is a group of order 24 isomorphic to the permutation group generated by reflections of the coxeter dynkin diagram 6 now the mirror image of the tetrahedron of 20 can be determined applying the same group of elements in 8 on the vector 4 s 3 a 1 1 1 2 i iir e 2 3 e e then the second orbit which is the mirror image of the set in 20 is determined to be 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 iio e e e e e e e e e e e e 21 of course we know that the union of two orbits in 20 and 21 determines the vertices of a cube the point here is that if we were restricted to the group of 8 then the tetrahedron in 20 would be a chiral solid however this is not true because there exist additional rotational symmetries which exchange these two orbits of 20 and 21 proving that the tetrahedron is not a chiral solid now we discuss these additional symmetries it is obvious that the coxeter diagram in fig 1 has an additional symmetry which permutes three diagrams indeed this symmetry extends the group to the proper octahedral rotation group as will be explained now one of the generators of this symmetry 2 c c 2 2 3 s 1 a 2 c c 2 3 2 3 2 2 e e e e d 2 e is a 2 fold rotation leading to the transformation it is straightforward to see that this proves that by a proper rotation tetrahedron can be transformed to its mirror image therefore it is not a chiral solid the generator d and those elements in 8 enlarge the symmetry to a group of order 8 which can be concisely written as the set of elements 1 1 2 3 3 e e e e e ii i o do 0 0 1 1 11 where the sets are defined by v v v v 0 and v 1 v 0 1 2 1 v e e 3 e 2 31 1 1 2 2 e ee v 22 a cyclic subgroup of the symmetric group permutes three sets like those in 22 extending the group of order 4 to a group of order 24 actually the larger group obtained by this extension is the chiral octahedral group of order 24 which can be symbolically written as 3 c 3 s 2 c c 2 4 3 t t t t s w b c 2 i 23 this is the proper rotational symmetry of the octahedron whose vertices are represented by the set of quaternions and the cube whose vertices are the union of the orbits 1 2 3 e e e i io o 4 the icosahedron derived from the orbit 3 2 1 2 3 o w a c a a a 8 the proper rotational subgroup of the coxeter group 3 w a s 4 is the tetrahedral group the even permutations of the four letters of order 12 they can be generated by the generators which satisfy the generation relation let 4 a 1 2 2 3 and b a r r r r 2 1 ab 3 3 a b 1 2 3 a a a be a general vector the following sets of vertices form equilateral triangles 24 21 2 1 2 2 3 2 3 r r r r r r r r 2 2 with the respective square of edge lengths we have another vertex as shown in fig 6 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 2 2 3 32 and 2 a a a a a a a a 1 3 3 1 r r r r 23 rr 21 rr 12 rr 31 rr 32 rr 13 54 2 figure 6 the vertices connected to the general vertex then one can obtain three more triangles by joining 1 3 r r to the vertices and by drawing a line between 1 2 3 2 and r r r r 2 1 2 3 and r r r r if we require that all these five triangles be equal each other then we obtain the relations 25 2 2 2 2 21 1 2 2 2 2 3 3 1 3 a a a a a a a a a a 2 factoring by and defining 22 a 31 2 2 and y aa x a a one obtains x y and a cubic equation 3 2 0 x x x assuming we get the solutions 0 x and x x 2 3 this leads to two vectors 2 1 2 2 1 nd i iia a 3 a 0 x 2 a here is an overall scale factor which can be adjusted accordingly the solution represents an octahedron which is not a chiral solid anyway let us study the orbit which is obtained from the vector when expressed in terms of quaternions it will readi 2 2 3 a e ei we choose the scale factor 2 a 2 for convenience to obtain the orbit 3 2 io w a c i we use the generators of the tetrahedral group of interest in terms of quaternions namely 9 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 d 2 2 c e e e e e e e e 3 26 they act on the quaternionic units as follows 1 2 3 1 1 1 2 2 3 d c e e e e e e e e e e 27 applying the generators c and d several times on the vector 2 3 1 2 i e e we obtain the set of vectors 1 2 2 3 3 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 io e e e e e e 28 which constitute the vertices of the icosahedron shown in fig 7 figure 7 the icosahedron obtained from tetrahedral symmetry 4 a xsimilarly if we use the solution we will get the vector 2 3 1 2 ii e e after a suitable choice of the factor a acting the generators in 27 repeatedly on the vector we get the orbit 2 ii 1 2 2 3 3 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 iio e e e e e e ii 29 this is another icosahedron which is the mirror image of the icosahedron of 28 indeed one can show that before we proceed further we note the fact that the coxeter dynkin diagram has the diagram symmetry 1 1 i iro o r o 2 2 and 3 a 1 3 in other words 1 3 a 2 nd 2 3 it is clear that this symmetry does not alter the orbits since under the diagram symmetry remain intact the diagram symmetry acts on the quaternions as e e this transformation can be obtained by the action of the element which is not an element of the groupw a the proper rotation group and i i i 1 1 2 e 1 e 2 3 3 e and e e 1 e 4 s 4 a t t can then be extended by the generator to the 1 1 e e 10 pyritohedral group 4 2 ht a c t t t t actually in the paper 6 we have shown that the orbit is invariant under a larger group io hi of 17 which admits the pyritohedral group as a maximal subgroup it is straightforward to see that the element 11 1 2 2 e e d 1 iiexchanges the two icosahedral orbits i o o d 090 one can see that the element represents a rotation around the first axis by and extends the group d 4 ta t to the proper octahedral rotation group 4 4 2 c t t t t s a this proves that two mirror images of the icosahedron are transformed to each other by rotations therefore the icosahedron is not a chiral solid rather it is achiral when two orbits of 28 and 29 are combined one obtains a quasi regular polyhedron which can be obtained as the orbit of the group w b 3 1 0 14 the quasi regular polyhedron represented by the combined vertices of 28 29 is shown in fig 8 it consists of two types of faces squares of side and isogonal hexagons of sides 1 and figure 8 the quasi regular polyhedron represented by the vertices of 28 29 although we know that the dual of an icosahedron is a dodecahedron 6 here we show how the vertices of the dodecahedron can be obtained from the vertices of the icosahedron say from the vertices of o i given in 28 we have to determine the centers of the planes in fig 6 we can choose the vector 1 as the vector representing the center of the face 1 because it is invariant under the rotation represented by in other words the triangle 1 is rotated to itself by a rotation around the vector 2 3 r r 1 with the same reason the center of the face 3 can be taken as the vector 3 we note that the line joining these vectors is orthogonal to the vector namely 1 3 i 0 i the centers of the faces 2 4 and 5 can be determined by averaging the vertices representing these faces 2 2 4 1 3 3 1 3 2 1 3 i i i i ib r r b b r r 1 2 3 i r r 1 2 i r r r r 5 1 1 3 3 i ir r 1 2 r r b 30 since we have the following relations among these three vect 5 bors 2 4 b 3 2 4 r r b 5 b they are in the same orbit under the group action therefore it is sufficient to work with one of these vectors say with in terms of the and 3 2 2 r r b 4 2 a b 2 b 4 4 a b 4 5 a b 11 quaternionic units it reads 2 2 2 6 b e 3 e 1 a quick check shows that 2 b is not orthogonal to the vector rather i 2 1 ib 0 provided 23 then we obtain three orbits 4 2 1 3 1 1 2 2 2 2 3 1 1 2 a b e e e e e e 31 4 1 1 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 a e e e e e e e e e e 2 3 e e 4 3 1 2 e e 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 a e e e e e e e e e 3 e note that the last two orbits represent the vertices of two dual tetrahedra when combined represent a cube these 20 vertices which decompose as three orbits under the tetrahedral group represent the vertices of a dodecahedron as shown in the fig 9 which is also achiral solid so far we have shown that although tetrahedron and icosahedron can be obtained as chiral solids there exists additional proper rotational group elements that convert them to their mirror images therefore they are not chiral solids figure 9 dodecahedron represented by the vertices of 31 although our main topic is to study the chiral objects systematically using the coxeter diagrams here with a brief digression we construct the pyritohedron a non regular dodecahedron made by 12 irregular pentagons if we plot the solid represented by the orbit 4 2 a b in the first line of 31 we obtain an irregular icosahedron as shown in fig 10 figure 10 irregular icosahedron represented by the vertices of the orbit 4 2 a b 12 let us recall that the vector 2 1 2 1 2 b 3 differs from the vector by the sign in front of i 2 in fig 11 we show the faces joining to the vector 2 b 2 2 b 1 3 54 2 2 2 2 222 2 2 2 figure 11 faces of the irregular icosahedron joined to the vertex 2 b there we see that two of the triangles are equilateral and the rest three are isosceles triangles we determine the centers of the faces of this irregular icosahedron the faces 1 and 3 can be represented again by the vectors 1 and 3 respectively the centers of the faces of the 2 4 and 5 can be determined up to a scale factor by averaging the vectors representing the vertices of the isosceles triangles they can be obtained up to a scale factor as 2 2 3 4 3 1 5 3 2 2 2 d e e d e e d e 1 e 32 these three vertices determine a plane which can be represented by its normal vector 25 7 d e e 3 up to a scale factor now we can determine the scale factor so that 2 1 d d 0 determines the five vertices lying in the same plane we obtain 205 280 1210 the particular edge represented by the vector d d 4 5 12 e leads to an orbit of size 6 given by 1 2 32 e e e this shows that pyritohedral group transforms this type of edges to each other the vertices of the pyritohedron are given by the set of quaternions 1 2 2 3 3 1 2 2 2 e e e e e e 1 3 1 2 1 2 o o e e e 3 33 which leads to the pyritohedron as shown in fig 12 its symmetry is represented by pyritohedral group 4 2 a c t t t t of order 24 the 20 vertices of the pyritohedron lie in three orbits 20 12 4 4 as shown in 33 13 figure 12 the pyritohedron consisting of irregular pentagonal faces a variety of pyritohedron can be constructed if two orbits of the tetrahedron leading to the vertices of a cube determined are chosen to be the set of quaternions then one can build the orbit of size 12 which depends on a single parameter indeed the following sets of 12 quaternions are invariant under the pyritohedral group 1 2 3 e e e ht 34 1 2 2 3 3 1 ae be ae be ae be b where are arbitrary real parameters here now three vectors determine a plane whose normal can be represented by the vector the condition that five points represented by the vectors and and a 2 3 3 ae be a b e a 3 e 1 ae be 2 3 e 1 2 e e 1 2 e e 3 e 2 3 3 1 ae be ae be a are in the same plane determines thatb a therefore the set of vertices of a pyritohedron has an arbitrary parameter and includes also dodecahedron and the rhombic dodecahedron 6 a catalan solid as members of the family for 2 2 a 2 aand respectively the pyritohedron is face transitive since the normal vectors of the faces form an orbit of size 12 under the pyritohedral group it is an achiral solid 5 the snub cube derived from the orbit 3 2 1 2 3 o w b c a a a the snub cube is an archimedean chiral solid its vertices and its dual solid can be determined employing the same method described in sec 3 and sec 4 the proper rotational subgroup of the coxeter group 3 4 w b s c 2 is the octahedral group 3 2 w b c s 4 isomorphic to the symmetric group of order 24 they can be generated by the generators 1 2 2 3 and b a r r r r 1 2 3 a a a which satisfy the generation relation let 3 4 2 1 a b ab be a general vector the following sets of vertices form an equilateral triangle and a square respectively 35 2 21 2 1 2 2 3 2 3 2 3 r r r r r r r r r r 3 14 with the respective square of edge lengths 2 2 21 1 2 2 2 2 3 3 2 and 2 2 a a a a a a a a 2 we have another vertex as shown in fig 13 1 3 3 1 r r r r 32 rr 223 rr 31 rr 23 rr 12 rr 21 rr 1 5 4 3 2 figure 13 the vertices connected to the vertex similar to the arguments discussed in sec 4 we obtain four equilateral triangles and one square sharing the vertex see fig 13 provided the following equations are satisfied 1 2 3 a a a 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 2 2 3 3 1 3 2 a a a a a a a a a a 2 factoring by and defining again 22 a 31 2 2 and y aa x a a one obtains 2 1 y 2 x and the cubic equation this equation has one real solution now the first orbit can be derived from the vector 3 2 1 0 x x x 1 8393 x 2 1 2 3 i a x y 1 2 3 y and its mirror image can be defined as 1 2 ii ir a 1 x in terms of quaternionic units the vectors read 2 12 1 2 3 1 e 2 i a x xe x e 2 12 1 2 3 1 2 ii a x e xe x e

each other so that they are truly chiral solids 15 a b figure 14 two snub cubes a io and b iio mirror image of each other one can combine the vertices of these two chiral solids in one solid which is achiral and it is depicted in fig 15 this quasi regular solid can be obtained from the vector 2 1 2 3 i a x y by applying the octahedral group 3 iw b figure 15 the quasi regular polyhedron consisting of two chiral orbits and io 3 iio the dual of the snub cube can be determined by determining the centers of the faces as shown in fig 13 similar arguments discussed in sec 4 can be used to determine the centers of the faces in fig 13 the faces 1 and 3 are represented by the vectors 1 and respectively the vectors representing the centers of the faces 2 4 and 5 can be determined and they lie in the same orbit under the proper octahedral group the vector representing the center of the face 2 can be given up to a scale factor in terms of the quaternionic units as 38 22 1 2 2 1 e c x e x e 3 the

snub dodecahedron and their duals using proper rotational subgroups of the octahedral group and the icosahedral group we used the coxeter diagrams 3 and 3 b h 1 1 1 a a a respectively employing the same technique for the diagrams we obtained the vertices of tetrahedron and icosahedrons which are not the chiral solids because they can be transformed to their mirror images by the proper rotational subgroup of the octahedral group 3 and a as a by product we also constructed the orbit of the pyritohedron using the pyritohedral group which is the symmetry of the iron pyrits this method can be extended to the higher dimensional coxeter groups to determine the chiral polytopes for example the snub 24 cell a chiral polytope in the 4 d euclidean space can be determined using the coxeter diagram 15 4 d 19 20 references 1 h s m coxeter and w o j moser generators and relations for discrete groups springer verlag 1965 2 f a cotton g wilkinson c a murillo m bochmann advanced inorganic
