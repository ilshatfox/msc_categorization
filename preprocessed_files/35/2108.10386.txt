critical points of laplace eigenfunctions on polygons chris judge and sugata mondal abstract we study the critical points of laplace eigenfunctions on polygo nal domains with a focus on the second neumann eigenfunction we show that if each convex quadrilaterals has no second neumann eigenfunction with an interior critical point then there exists a convex quadrilateral with an unsta ble critical point we also show that each critical point of a second neumann eigenfunction on a lip 1 polygon with no orthogonal sides is an acute vertex 1 introduction a second neumann eigenfunction u of the laplacian approximates the tempera ture distribution of an insulated domain for large times the hot spots conjecture rch 74 kwl 85 is the assertion that u does not assume its maximum value in the interior of the domain the conjecture is false for some non contractible plane domains brdwrn 99 brd 05 but is still believed to be true for convex domains the conjecture is known to be true when the domains are somewhat elongated for example the lip 1 planar domains of atrbrd 04 in jdgmnd 20 jdgmnd 21 a we show that the hot spots conjecture holds true for acute triangles thus resolving polmath 7 polymath in the present paper we extend our study of critical points of eigenfunctions to general polygons and we encounter new phenomena note that every planar domain may be approximated by polygonal domains and hence the weak form of the hot spots conjecture some second neumann eigenfunction has no interior maximum for all planar domains would follow from the verification of the strong hot spots conjecture every second neumann eigenfunction has no interior maximum for all polygonal domains our general approach to the hot spots conjecture is based on the fact that eigen functions and their critical points 1 vary continuously as one varies the domain roughly speaking to show that a second neumann eigenfunction u 0 on a polygon u 0 has no interior critical points one constructs a path of polygons pt and associ ated path of eigenfunctions ut so that the eigenfunction u 1 on p 1 has no interior critical points if one can show that the putative critical points of each ut are stable under perturbation then u 0 also has no interior critical points in the case of triangles we took p 1 to be a right isosceles triangle and we established enough stability to successfully implement this strategy jdgmnd 20 the work of c j is partially supported by a simons foundation collaboration grant the work of s m is partially supported by ramanujan fellowship of serb govt of india 1 with the exception of rectangles the critical set of a second neumann eigenfunction on a simply connected polygon is finite jdgmnd 21 b 1 ar x iv 2 10 8 10 38 6 v 1 m at h a p 2 3 a ug 2 02 1 2 chris judge and sugata mondal jdgmnd 21 a here we show that the strategy is likely to be more difficult to implement if the polygon has more sides theorem 1 1 if each convex quadrilateral has no interior critical point then there exists a convex quadrilateral q a second neumann eigenfunction u on q and a nonvertex critical point p of u that is not stable under perturbation by stable under perturbation we mean that if qn is a sequence of quadrilaterals that converges to q and un is a sequence of second neumann eigenfunctions on qn that converges to u then each un has a critical point pn so that pn converges to p we conjecture that instability does not hold for triangles on the other hand we are able to successfully apply our strategy for resolving the hot spots conjecture to a large class of polygons theorem 1 2 suppose that pt is a path of polygons such that each pt has exactly two acute vertices no two sides of pt are orthogonal and p 1 is an obtuse triangle then the second neumann eigenvalue of p 0 is simple and the set of critical points of each eigenfunction consists of the two acute vertices the class of polygons described in theorem 1 2 is exactly up to rigid motion the class of polygons that have no orthogonal sides and satisfy the lip 1 condition of atrbrd 04 see proposition 7 7 thus theorem 1 2 provides a non probabilistic proof of the weak hot spots conjecture for lip 1 domains moreover in contrast to the result of atrbrd 04 we find that not only are there no interior critical points but there are also no critical points on the boundary other than the two acute vertices recently jonathan rohleder rhl 21 announced a non probabilistic proof of the main result of atrbrd 04 we now outline the contents of this paper in section 2 we use the bessel expan sion of an eigenfunction u to understand the nodal set of xu near a vertex where x is a constant resp rotational vector field in particular we show that whether or not an arc of the nodal set xu ends at the vertex is essentially determined by the first two bessel coefficients the angle at v and the angle between the vector field and the sides adjacent to v resp location of central point these criteria will be used crucially in the proof of theorem 1 2 we will need to rule out the possibility that critical points of a sequence of eigenfunctions associated to a convergent sequence of polygons converge to a ver tex of the limiting polygon in 3 we show in various contexts that if critical points converge to a vertex v then the first two bessel coefficients of the limiting eigenfunction equal zero if the limiting polygon is simply connected then this is impossible proposition 6 3 to check the stability of a critical point under perturbation we will use a variant of the poincare hopf index in 4 we define this invariant to include vertices and we prove a variant of the poincare hopf index formula for neumann eigenfunctions u on polygons we relate the index of a critical point of u located at a vertex v with the first two bessel coefficients of u at v we also show that the total local index is unchanged under perturbation theorem 4 11 as a consequence each non zero index critical point is stable lemma 4 12 in 5 we provide a local normal form for an eigenfunction in a neighborhood of a critical point p of u whose poincare hopf index equals zero lemma 5 1 using this local normal form we find that an index zero critical point cannot be a degree critical points of laplace eigenfunctions on polygons 3 1 vertex of the nodal set of xu where x is either a constant or rotational vector field in 6 we specialize to simply connected polygons for such domains the nodal set of a second neumann eigenfunction u is a simple arc and from this fact we deduce that at least one of the first two bessel coefficients at each vertex is nonzero this implies a tighter relationship between the index of a vertex critical point of u and the first two bessel coefficients corollary 6 4 in 7 we prove theorem 1 2 theorem 7 3 we first show that if polygon p has at least one acute vertex and a second neumann eigenfunction u on p has an interior critical point then either u has four non zero index critical points or there exists a side e of p such that the nodal set of the derivative of u in the direction u has an arc that ends at a vertex v of p this leads us to consider for the path ut in theorem 1 2 the number s t of nonzero index critical points and the number v t of vertices that are endpoints of an nodal arc of the derivative of ut in the direction of a side of p we show that the set a of t 0 1 such that either s t 3 or v t 1 is open and closed for the obtuse triangle p 1 we have s 1 0 and v 1 0 and hence a is empty in particular the initial polygon p 0 has at most two non zero index critical points and from this we deduce using the results of 5 that there are zero index critical points using the fact that v 0 0 we find that the two critical points are located at the vertices of p 0 these two critical points are the unique global extrema and this implies that the eigenspace is one dimensional in 8 we provide a criterion for the instability of a critical point on a quadrilateral this criterion is based on the fact that the index of a vertex with angle less than cannot equal 1 corollary 6 4 in particular an index 1 critical point cannot cross from one side adjacent to a vertex to the other side of the vertex if the angle at the vertex is in 2 hence one is led to find a path of quadrilaterals qt such that q 0 has an index 1 that lies on one side of a vertex and q 1 and has an index 1 critical point on the other side of the vertex in 9 we construct such a path af quadrilaterals and thus prove theorem 1 1 theorem 9 5 the path is constructed by taking a nearly isosceles triangle whose vertex v of smallest angle is less than 3 and then breaking the side opposite to v in 10 we specialize to convex polygons and find that if a second neumann eigen function has only three critical points then one is a minimum one is a maximum and the third has index zero 2 eigenfunctions on a sector to understand the behavior of an eigenfunction in a neighborhood a vertex v of angle of a polygon we will consider its fourier bessel expansion by performing a rigid motion we may assume that the vertex v is the origin one side adjacent to v lies in the ray z r r 0 the nonnegative real axis and the other side lies in the ray z r ei r 0 if u is a real eigenfunction with eigenvalue that satisfies neumann conditions on the the rays 0 and then separation of variables leads to the fourier bessel expansion 1 u rei n 0 cn jn r cos n 4 chris judge and sugata mondal here cn r and j denotes the bessel function of the first kind of order lebedev 2 j x x k 0 1 k x 2 k 22 k k k 1 where is the gamma function if u satisfies dirichlet conditions on the rays 0 and then the one re places cos with sin and if u satisfies dirichlet conditions on the ray 0 and neu mann conditions on the ray then one replaces cos n with sin n 2 and jn with jn 2 from 2 we find that for each 0 there exists an entire function g so that j r r g r 2 2 note that neither g nor g vanishes in a neighborhood of 0 for each 0 with this notation 1 takes a more compact form 3 u rei n 0 cn rn gn r 2 cos n where note that we are suppressing the dependence of g on the eigenvalue given a function f let z f f 1 0 denote the nodal set of f for each r let l denote the constant vector field defined by 4 l u cos x sin y lemma 2 1 let u be an eigenfunction that satisfies neumann conditions on the rays 0 and a if c 0 6 0 and either 0 2 or c 1 0 then there exists an arc in z l u with an endpoint at the vertex v if and only if 2 2 mod b if c 1 6 0 and 2 then there exists an arc in z l u with an endpoint at the vertex if and only if 2 2 mod c if c 1 6 0 and then there exists an arc in z l u with an endpoint at the vertex if and only if 2 mod moreover near the vertex v this arc lies on p d if c 1 6 0 and then there exists an arc in z l u with an endpoint at the vertex if and only if 2 2 mod moreover in all of the above situations z l u has at most one arc with an endpoint at the origin proof if 2 mod resp 2 mod then because u satisfies neumann conditions the arc corresponding to 0 resp lies in both z l u because x cos r sin r 1 and y sin r cos r 1 we have 5 l cos r sin 1 r if c 0 6 0 and either c 1 0 or 0 2 inspection of 3 shows that 6 u rei a b r 2 f r 2 note that though g depends on the eigenvalue we will suppress from the notation critical points of laplace eigenfunctions on polygons 5 figure 1 some of the cases described by lemma 2 1 the region shaded pink is a neighborhood of the vertex v with angle the region shaded green describes the directions l for which l u has a nodal arc ending at v where a and b are constants and l f o r and l f o r in particular we find that 7 l u rei 2 b r cos o r and 8 l u rei 2 b r sin o r if 2 2 mod then from 7 we find that l u r and l u rei have opposite signs for sufficiently small r thus by the intermediate value the orem there exists r 0 so that l u rei r 0 moreover from 8 we find that the point r is unique for sufficiently small r and by the implicit function theorem is smooth the map r 7 rei r is the desired arc in z l u the uniqueness of r implies that there is at most one arc thus we have proven a to prove b note that if 2 or c 0 0 then inspection of 3 shows that u r ei c 0 c 1 r cos o r 6 chris judge and sugata mondal and hence a straightforward computation gives l u r ei c 1 r 1 cos 1 o r 1 note that cos 1 vanishes if and only if 2 mod one argues as in the proof of part a to obtain a unique arc of z l u that ends at v parts c and d follow from arguments similar those that verified a and b lemma 2 1 motivates the following definition definition 2 2 suppose 6 2 and u is a neumann eigenfunction on the sector of angle we define the leading bessel coefficient of u at v to be c 0 if 2 and c 1 if 2 the definition allows us to succinctly state the following corollaries corollary 2 3 if l is a nonzero constant vector field parallel to one the boundary rays of the sector of angle 6 2 then the leading coefficient vanishes if and only if an arc of z lu ends at v proof since l is parallel to one of the boundary rays the vector field l is a multiple of l with 0 or in particular z lu z l u by using the reflection symmetry about 2 we may assume without loss of generality that 0 suppose that the leading coefficient does not vanish if 2 then part a of lemma 2 1 implies that no arc in z l u ends at the vertex similarly parts b c and d imply that no arc in z l u ends at the vertex in the other cases conversely suppose that the leading coefficient does equal zero let k be the smallest positive integer such that ck 6 0 if 2 then c 0 0 and from 3 we find that u r ei rk cos k o rk hence using 4 we find that l u r ei k rk 1 cos k 1 o rk 1 since 2 and k 1 the function cos k 1 vanishes for some 0 an implicit function theorem argument establishes the existence of a smooth arc if 2 then a similar argument applies to give the claim corollary 2 4 let u be a neumann eigenfunction on a sector of angle 6 2 such that one of the first two bessel coefficients of u is non zero if l is a constant vector field such that some arc in z lu ends at the vertex and l is not orthogonal to a boundary ray of the sector then for each constant vector field l that is sufficiently close to l some arc of z l u ends at the vertex critical points of laplace eigenfunctions on polygons 7 proof since 6 2 by proposition 4 4 jdgmnd 20 there exists a neighborhood n of the vertex v of the sector that contains no critical points of u since at least one of the zeroth and the first bessel coefficients of u at v is non zero by lemma 2 1 the set z lu contains exactly one arc that ends at v in particular u has opposite signs on the the two rays of the sector by continuity for each constant vector field l that is sufficiently close to l some arc of z l u must end at some point pl near v depending on l that lies on the boundary of the sector to finish the proof it suffices to show that pl v for l sufficiently close to l if pl is not v then since l is not orthogonal to the sides of the sector so is l and hence pl is a critical point of u if l is sufficiently close then by continuity pl lies in n this contradicts the first paragraph of the proof let s denote the sector z r ei 0 mod recall that rw denotes the vector field that corresponds to rotation about w c corollary 2 5 let u be an eigenfunction that satisfies neumann conditions on the sides 0 and suppose that c 0 and c 1 are not both equal to zero 1 if 2 a and c 0 6 0 then an arc of z rw ends at the vertex if and only if w lies in s b and c 0 0 then an arc of z rw ends at the vertex if and only if w does not lie in s 2 if 2 a and c 1 6 0 then an arc of z rw ends at the vertex if and only if w does not lie in s b and c 1 0 then an arc of z rw ends at the vertex if and only if w lies in s proof if w ei then a computation shows that the rotational vector field about w takes the form rw l 2 because u o r and 2 u o r we find that 7 and 8 still hold with l replaced by rw and replaced by 2 thus the argument given in the proof of lemma 2 1 applies remark 2 6 similar statements hold for dirichlet and mixed boundary conditions we leave the formulation of the statements to the reader 3 critical points on a sector converging to a vertex let sn be a sequence of sectors that converges to a sector s let un sn r be a sequence of neumann eigenfunctions that converges to a neumann eigenfunction u s r in this section we show that if certain types of critical points of un converge to the vertex of s then the two bessel coefficients of the u must vanish some of these results are straightforward extensions of results in jdgmnd 20 but several are new let b and b denote the distinct boundary rays of the sector s let c 0 and c 1 denote the respective bessel coefficients of u at the vertex of s let denote the vertex angle of s and let 8 chris judge and sugata mondal lemma 3 1 compare proposition 9 1 jdgmnd 20 for each n let pn be a critical point of un that lies in the interior of sn if pn converges to the vertex of s then c 1 0 if in addition then c 0 0 proof let n be the angle of the sector sn and let n n by performing rigid motions if necessary we may assume without loss of generality that the vertex s and each of sn is 0 and that the boundary rays of sn are 0 n using 3 and the fact that sin divides sin k for each k we find that un r ei n r n sin n c 1 n g n r o r n thus since pn rn exp i n is a critical point 0 n n and g 0 6 0 we find that c 1 n o r n n in particular since un converges to u we have c 1 limn c 1 n 0 from 3 we find run r ein c 0 n 2 r g 0 r 2 c 1 n n r n 1 g n r 2 cos n o r n thus since pn rn exp i n is a critical point g 0 0 6 0 and c 1

critical point of un that lies in the boundary ray of sn that converges to b and let qn be a critical point of un that lies in the boundary ray of sn that converges to b if the sequences pn and qn both converge to the vertex of s then c 1 0 if then we also have c 0 0 proof let n be the angle of the sector sn by performing rigid motions if neces sary we may assume without loss of generality that the vertex s and each of sn is 0 and that the boundary rays of sn are 0 n thus there exist sequences rn and sn so that pn rn and qn sne i n from 3 we find that run r c 0 n 2 r g 0 r 2 c 1 n n r n 1 g n r 2 o r n 1 r 2 n 1 run s ei n c 0 n 2 s g 0 s 2 c 1 n n s n 1 g n s 2 o s n 1 s 2 n 1 since pn rn and qn sne i n are critical points the radial derivative of un vanishes at these points and hence 0

that n 1 and for sufficiently large n thus critical points of laplace eigenfunctions on polygons 9 for n sufficiently large we have c 0 n o r 1 n s 1 n r 2 n s 2 n therefore c 0 limn c 0 n 0 lemma 3 3 compare lemma 9 3 jdgmnd 20 let pn be a critical point of un and suppose that pn converges to the vertex of s if 2 then c 0 0 if 2 then c 1 0 proof by performing rigid motions if necessary we may assume without loss of generality the boundary rays of sn are 0 and n by lemma 3 1 passing to a subsequence and applying a reflection across n 2 if necessary we may assume without loss of generality that pn rn lies in the positive real axis as in the proof of lemma 3 2 we have 13 0 c 0 n 2 rn g 0 r 2 n c 1 n n r n 1 n g n r 2 n o r n 1 r 2 n 1 if 2 then there exists 0 so that n 2 for n

large hence since g 0 6 0 it follows from 13 that c 1 n o r n thus c 1 lim c 1 n 0 lemma 3 4 suppose that 6 2 and suppose that for each n the sector sn is bounded by the rays 0 and n and there exist 0 rn sn such that ru rn 0 and 2 ru sn 0 if sn converges to zero as n tends to infinity then c 0 0 c 1 proof because 0 and n there exists 0 such that n 1 1 and hence 1 n n 1 from 3 we have run r c 0 n 2

sugata mondal suppose 2 then 2 and so since n there exists 0 so that for sufficiently large n 17 1 n 1 b n sn a n rn 1 since rn sn we have r 2 nn s 2 nn therefore from 16 we find that c 0 n a rn s 2 n o r 2 n r n n s 2 n s n n thus since rn sn we find that c 0 n o r nn s nn r 2 n 2 n s 2 n 2 n and hence 18 c 0 n o r 1 n s 1 n r 2 n s 2 n therefore c 0 lim c 0 n 0 suppose 2 then since n 2 there exists 0 so that for sufficiently large n 19 1 a n rn b n sn 1 since r 2 nn s 2 n from 16 one deduces that c 0 0 in this case by arguing in a similar manner to show that c 1 0 we argue similarly from 15 we find that 0 c 0 n c 1 n r n 2 n a n rn o r 2 n r n n 0 c 0 n c 1 n n 1 s n 2 n b n sn o s 2 n s n n and hence by subtracting c 1 n r n 2 n a n rn n 1 s n 2 n b n sn o r 2 n r n n s 2 n s n n now argue as was done to show that c 0 0 in particular in the case 2 use 19 and in the case 2 use 17 corollary 3 5 suppose and 6 2 suppose that for each n the points pn and qn are distinct critical points if pn and qn both converge to the vertex of s then c 0 0 c 1 proof by applying rigid motions we may assume that sn is bounded by the rays 0 and n by lemma 3 1 and lemma 3 2 it suffices to assume that pn and bn lie in the same boundary ray and by reflecting if necessary about n 2 we may assume that both pn and qn are real by relabeling we may assume that pn qn by assumption r pn 0 r qn and so rolle s theorem implies that there exist sn such that pn sn qn and 2 r sn 0 the claim now follows from lemma 3 4 corollary 3 6 let s be a sector with angle and not equal to 2 and let u s r be a neumann eigenfunction if the vertex v is an accumulation point of the critical points of u then c 0 0 c 1 proof apply corollary 3 5 with sn s and un u critical points of laplace eigenfunctions on polygons 11 lemma 3 7 suppose and 6 2 if pn is a degenerate critical point of un that converges to the vertex of s then c 0 0 c 1 proof by applying rigid motions we may assume that sn is bounded by 0 and n by lemma 3 1 by passing to a subsequence and by applying a reflection across n 2 if necessary we may assume that pn lies in the boundary ray 0 that is pn rn 0 and run rn 0 since un satisfies neumann conditions along the real axis and pn is a degenerate critical point we have either 2 xun rn 0 or 2 yun pn 0 if 2 xun rn 0 then lemma 3 4 with sn rn implies the claim suppose then that 2 yun pn 0 along the ray 0 we have 2 y r 1 r r 2 2 since run rn 0 we have 2 yun rn 2 un rn and so 0 2 un rn c 1 n 2 n r n g 0 r 2 n o r 2 n n since un satisfies the first equation in 13 we find that 0 2 yun rn 2 c 0 n g 0 r 2 n o r nn r 2 n 2 n since there exists 0 so that n 1 for suficiently large n since g 0 and its derivative do not vanish at zero it follows that c 0 limn c 0 n 0 and c 1 limn c 1 n 0 remark 3 8 note that in the proof of lemma 3 7 we used the condition 6 2 only in the case that 2 run pn 0 indeed the proof shows that if 2 un pn 0 then c 0 0 c 1 even if 2 4 a poincare hopf formula for critical points of eigenfunctions on a polygon in this section we provide a variant of the the classical poincare hopf index theorem for the gradient of laplace eigenfunctions on a planar polygonal domain p the discussion will focus on eigenfunctions satisfying neumann boundary con ditions but the methods apply to give variants in the contexts of dirichlet and mixed boundary conditions let u p r be a neumann eigenfunction and let p p suppose that there exists a deleted disc neighborhood d of p that contains no zeros of u then the closure of each component of d z u z u p is an arc 3 if such an arc contains p then we will say that the arc emanates from p let n be the number of arcs in z u z u p that emanate from p and define ind u p 1 1 2 n if p p 1 n if p p note that if ind u p 6 0 and p is not a vertex of p then p is a critical point 4 if p is a vertex and ind u p 6 0 then we will regard p as a critical point of u let s denote the euler characteristic of a surface s let crit u denote the set of critical points of u including the vertices v such that ind u v 6 0 the following is a variant of the classical poincare hopf formula taylor 3 if the closure of some component were a loop then the the loop would bound a disk that contained a critical point 4 the converse is not true namely there may be critical points with index equal to zero see 5 12 chris judge and sugata mondal proposition 4 1 index formula let u p r be a neumann eigenfunction such that the set crit u is finite 2 p p crit u p 2 ind u p p crit u p ind u p proof let dp be the double of p the closed surface without boundary obtained by gluing two disjoint copies of p along their respective boundaries the surface dp has a natural real analytic structure on the complement of the set c of cone points corresponding to the vertices of p because u is a neumann eigefunction u extends to a real analytic function u dp c r that is invariant under the isometric involution that exchanges the two copies of p for each p dp we define ind u p 1 n 2 because u is a neumann eigenfunction we find that ind u p ind u p for p p including vertices let a be the union of the level sets of u that contain critical points of u the complement of a consists of topological annuli and hence by the euler poincare formula dp a on the other hand the number of edges in a equals 1 2 p np where np is the valence of the graph a at p it follows that dp crit u ind u p where crit u includes p c such that ind u p 6 0 we have dp 2 p and for every interior critical of u we have two critical points of u with the same index the claimed formula follows remark 4 2 there are also variants of proposition 4 1 in the contexts of dirichlet and mixed boundary conditions for example if u satisfies dirichlet conditions then formula 4 1 holds true if one redefines ind u p 2 k for each for p p remark 4 3 the classical poincare hopf theorem applies to a smooth vector field x on an oriented closed surface s that has finitely many critical points if is a simple oriented loop that encloses at most one zero p of x then the restriction of x x to defines a map from the unit circle to itself the index of x at p is the degree of this self map of the circle see for example taylor 1 10 if x f then this index equals 1 k 2 where k is the number of components of f 1 f p p in the context of a vector field x the poincare hopf index formula gives that the sum of the indices of the zeros of x equals the euler characteristic of s assumption 4 4 in what follows we will assume that each critical point p is isolated and so the index ind u p is well defined in jdgmnd 21 b we show that rectangles are the only simply connected polygons whose second neumann eigenfunctions have infinitely many critical points hence the assumption reduces to the assumption that the polygon is not a rectangle in the simply connected case proposition 4 5 the point p p is a local extremum if and only if ind u p 1 proof we have ind u p 1 if and only if there exists a punctured disc neighbor hood d of p so that u z 6 u p for each z d since u is continuous we have either u z u p for all z d or u z u p for all z d this occurs if and only if p is a local extremum of u suppose that v is a vertex of p that is not a limit point of the zeros of u the index ind u v is determined by the bessel expansion 3 of u near v critical points of laplace eigenfunctions on polygons 13 lemma 4 6 let p be a polygon let v be a vertex of p with angle and let u be a neumann eigenfunction on p let k 1 be the smallest positive integer so that ck 6 0 and suppose that v is a critical point of u i if u v 0 or k 2 then ind u v 1 k ii if u v 6 0 and k 2 then ind u v 1 iii if u v 6 0 and k 2 then 1 k ind u v 1 in particular if 6 2 or 3 2 then ind u v equals either 1 or 1 k a similar statement can be derived in the cases of dirichlet or mixed boundary conditions proof without loss of generality v 0 and the sides adjacent to v bound the sector 0 if u 0 0 or k 2 then from 3 there exist b 6 0 and a so that u r ei a b rk cos k o rk using for example the implicit function theorem one finds that there exists a disk neighborhood d of 0 such that d u 1 u v v consists of k arcs each with an endpoint at v it follows that ind u 0 1 k suppose u v 6 0 and k 2 then k 2 and hence from 3 we find that u z a b r 2 o r 2 where a 6 0 6 b hence v is a local extremum of u and so by proposition 4 5 ind u v 1 if u v 6 0 and k 2 then from 3 we have u r ei a r 2 b c cos k o r 2 where a b and c are nonzero constants if b c then ind u v will depend on the o r 2 error term in this case 1 k ind u v 1 corollary 4 7 suppose is not a multiple of 2 1 if c 1 0 then ind u v 6 0 2 if 2 then c 1 0 if and only if ind u v 6 0 proof let k be as in the statement of lemma 4 6 if c 1 0 then k 1 and hence lemma 4 6 implies that ind u v 6 0 if 2 and c 1 6 0 then k 1 and we are in case i of lemma 4 6 thus ind u v 0 remark 4 8 in the case that is a multiple of 2 and u v 6 0 part iii of lemma 4 6 provides only an inequality for ind u v yet one can determine the index in finitely many steps in particular if k 2 then u z u v r 2 a cos 2 o r 2 where a c 0 g 0 0 ck g 2 0 if a 1 then ind u v 1 and if a 1 then ind u v 1 k if a 1 then by considering more terms of the bessel expansion one can identify ind u v if p is an isolated critical point of an eignfunction u that lies in the interior of a polygon p then ind u p equals the degree of the mapping u u as described in remark 4 3 if p lies in the interior of a side of p then one may reflect 14 chris judge and sugata mondal a neumann eigenfunction across the side to u and then find that ind u p equals degree of the map u u if p is a vertex we may also interpret ind u v in terms of the degree of the self map of the circle induced by a vector field indeed let d be a disc centered at p that intersects no sides of p other than the side s adjacent to p and so that d p contains no critical points of u other than possibly p by applying a rigid motion we way assume that p 0 and that d p lies in the sector s bounded by the rays 0 and moreover by rescaling if necessary we may assume that d is the unit disk the map z 7 z maps h z c z 1 and y 0 to the sector d p in particular the function w z u z 1 is defined on h if u is given by 3 then 20 w r ei j 0 cj rj gj r 2 cos j we may extend w smoothly to d 0 by setting w z w z lemma 4 9 the degree of the restriction of w w to the unit circle equals 2 ind u q where the sum is over critical points q of u that lie d proof suppose q 6 0 is a critical point of u if q lies in the interior of p then q corresponds to two critical points q and q of w which have the same indices as q by remark 4 3 since w is smooth at q the index ind w q equals the degree of the restriction of w w to a small circle centered at q if q 6 0 lies on the boundary of p then q corresponds to a single critical point q of w and ind w q equals the degree of w w on a small circle centered at q by choosing disjoint circles and applying a standard argument 5 we find that it suffices to assume that u has no critical points in d 0 since u has no critical points in d 0 the function w has no critical points in d 0 in particular since w vanishes on the real line it follows that w z 6 w 0 for each z 6 0 on the real axis hence the number of arcs in z w z w 0 that emanate from 0 equals twice the number of arcs in z u z u 0 that emanate from 0 thus to complete the proof it suffices to show that the degree of w w where is the unit circle equals 1 n 2 where n is the number of arcs of z w z w 0 that emanate from 0 let h z w z w 0 and let k be the smallest positive interger such that ck 6 0 then h r ei ck k rk 1 gk r 2 sin k o rk and so there exists r 0 0 so that if 0 r r 0 then the set h r ei 0 consists of exactly 2 k elements 0 r 2 k 1 r using the implicit function theorem we find that for each j the map r 7 j r is smooth by relabeling if necessary we may assume that limr 0 j r j k the function h has no critical points in d 0 and so the degree of h h equals the degree of the map h h 0 where 0 is the standard counterclockwise parameterization of r r 0 choose a homeomorphism d d that is isotopic to the identity map that is smooth away from 0 and that maps each ray j k to the arc j then 5 see for example the proof of proposition 20 2 in taylor critical points of laplace eigenfunctions on polygons 15 if we define h z h then the degree of h h 0 equals the degree of h h 0 and ind h 0 ind h 0 let j 1 2 k and let j j k since h has no critical points in d 0 the mean value theorem implies that r 7 h rei j is strictly increasing and thus h rei j 6 0 for each r 0 r 0 let j 1 1 denote the sign of the function r 7 h rei j note that j is also the sign of rh rei j the number arcs in z h z 0 emanating from 0 equals the number of j 1 2 k such that j 6 j 1 indeed for each fixed r the restriction of 7 h rei to the interval ij j j 1 is monotone and hence 7 h rei assumes the value 0 at most once and it assumes the value 0 if and only if j 6 j 1 in other words ind h 0 equals the number of j such that j 6 j 1 to compute the degree of h h 0 we first regard this map as a map x r 2 z r 2 z in particular for each there exists a unique x so that h h r ei corresponds to the point eix in the unit circle in other words x is the angle between the vector x and h measured counterclockwise we have h rh r r 2 h since h re j 0 we have h rh r and so x j j mod 2 if j 1 j mod 2 if j 1 we also have h r 0 e i 0 if and only ifx mod 2 and h r 0 ei 0 if and only if x in particular we have either x for each ij or x for each ij if j 1 j 1 then x j j and x j 1 j 1 and either x for each ij or x for each ij it follows that the restriction of x to ij is homotopic to the identity map rel endpoints similarly if j 1 j 1 then the restriction of x to ij is homotopic to the identity map rel endpoints if j 1 and j 1 1 then h r 0 ei 0 for each ij and so x mod 2 we also have x j j mod 2 and x j 1 j 1 mod 2 it follows that x is homotopic rel endpoints to the linear map y j ij r 2 z defined by y j 1 k j j mod 2 similarly if j 1 and j 1 1 then one finds that x ij is homotopic rel endpoints to the map y j ij r 2 z defined by y j 1 k j j mod 2 using the identity map on ij when j j 1 and the maps y j and y j when j 6 j 1 one constructs a piecewise linear map y r 2 z r 2 z that is homotopic to x an elementary argument shows that y is in turn homotopic to the map z defined by z 1 n 2 mod 2 where n is the number of j such that j 6 j 1 the claim follows remark 4 10 if the angle at v is not a multiple of 2 then k 6 2 and the proof of lemma 4 9 can be significantly shortened indeed one can use expansion 16 chris judge and sugata mondal 20 as in the proof of lemma 4 6 however if 2 or 3 2 then using expansion 20 is more cumbersome see remark 4 8 let pk be a sequence of n gons and let p be an n gon we will say that pk converges to p if and only if there exists a sequence of homeomorphisms k p p k that are c 2 diffeomorphisms on the complement of the vertices such that k converges uniformly in c 2 to the identity map on each compact subset of p that does not include the vertices given continuous functions uk pk c and u p c we will say that uk converges to u if and only if uk k converges to u proposition 4 11 stability of the total index suppose that pn is a sequence of polygons that converges to p and suppose that un pn r is a sequence of neumann eigenfunctions that converge to a neumann eigenfunction u p r let p p and suppose that d c is an open disk neighborhood of p such that d contains no zeros of u let a resp an denote the set of critical points of u resp un that lie in d if a and an are finite then for each n sufficiently large q a ind u q q an ind un q proof the gradient un converges to u and so the sets an converges to a first we suppose that p lies in the interior of p let be a counterclockwise pa rameterization of d by proposition 20 2 in taylor we have that q a ind u q deg u u and q an ind un q deg un un but the vector field un un converges to deg u u and hence the degrees converge since the degree is an integer invariant the degrees coincide for all sufficiently large n if p lies on the boundary of p the we apply lemma 4 9 we have q a ind u q deg w w and q an ind un q deg wn wn where w and wn are constructed as in 20 since wn converges to w the degree of wn wn converges to the degree of w w the claim the follows from lemma 4 9 lemma 4 12 let pn be a sequence of polygons that converges to a polygon p and let un pn r be a sequence of neumann eigenfunctions that converge to a neumann eigenfunction u p r if u has finitely many nonzero index critical points then there exists n such that if n n then the number of nonzero index critical points of un is greater than or equal to the number of critical points of u proof let p be a nonzero index critical point of p in particular p is isolated and so there exists a disk neighborhood dp of p that contains no critical points of u other than p since ind u p 6 0 proposition 4 11 implies that for sufficiently large n at least one nonzero index critical points of un lies in dp since the various disks dp are disjoint the claim follows lemma 4 13 let u be a nonconstant neumann eigenfunction on a polygon p if the set of critical points of u is discrete then each local extremum p of the restriction u p is a critical point of u proof suppose that p lies in the interior of a side e of p since p is a local extremum of u p we have leu p 0 thus since u satisfies neumann conditions at p we have u 0 critical points of laplace eigenfunctions on polygons 17 5 index zero critical points on a side of a polygon in this section u is a neumann eigenfunction on a polygon p and p is an isolated critical point of u that lies in a side e of p we show in lemma 5 1 that if ind u p 0 then the level set z u z u p is a cusp that is tangent to e see lemma 5 1 we then use this to show that if the nodal set of xu where x is either a rotational or constant vector field has a degree 1 vertex then the vertex is a critical point with nonzero index proposition 5 2 by applying a rigid motion to p we may assume that p 0 and that the side that contains p lies in the real axis lemma 5 1 suppose that p is an index zero critical point of a neummann eigen function u that belongs to the side e then there exist real analytic functions c c r and r r and an odd integer k 3 so that c 0 6 0 0 6 0 and 21 u z u 0 c z y 2 xk x proof because the index of the critical point p of u equals zero the hessian of u has exactly one nonzero eigenvalue the eigenspace e that corresponds to the nonzero eigenvalue is invariant under the reflection z 7 z thus e is either the real or the imaginary axis we claim that e is not the real axis indeed suppose to the contrary that e is the real axis then xu 0 0 but 2 x u 0 6 0 the weierstrass preparation theorem applies to provide unique real analytic functions a b 1 and b 2 defined near 0 so that a 0 6 0 b 1 0 0 b 2 0 and u z u 0 a z x 2 b 1 y x b 2 y for z near p 0 since the factorization is unique and u z u z we have bj y bj y for j 1 2 in particular the discriminant d y b 1 y 2 4 b 2 y is an even function if d were to vanish on a neighborhood of 0 then we would have u z u 0 a z x b 1 y 2 2 and hence u z x b 1 y 2 2 a z 2 a z x b 1 y 2 x b 1 y 2 thus u would vanish along the level set of u that contains p 0 but by assump tion p 0 is an isolated zero of u since d is even and ind u 0 6 1 it follows that d y 0 for y 6 0 sufficiently small and hence there exists a neighborhood u of p 0 so that the intersection of u 1 u p p and u consists of four arcs this contradicts the assumption that p is a zero index critical point of u therefore e coincides with the imaginary axis by use of the weierstrass prepa ration theorem we find that 22 u z u 0 a z y 2 b 1 x y b 2 x for unique real analytic functions a b 1 and b 2 defined near 0 where a 0 6 0 and b 1 0 0 b 2 0 since the factorization is unique and u z u z we find that b 1 x 0 because p is an isolated critical point there exists 0 so that b 2 x 6 0 if 0 x we claim that moreover b 2 x b 2 x 0 if 0 x indeed otherwise b 2 x b 2 x 0 and thus from 22 we find that there exists a neighborhood u of p 0 so that the intersection of u 1 u p p and u consists of four arcs this contradicts the assumption that p is a zero index critical point of u 18 chris judge and sugata mondal since b 2 x b 2 x 0 the first nonzero term in the taylor series of b 2 about zero has odd degree k and since xu 0 0 we also have k 3 the claim follows proposition 5 2 let x be either a constant vector field or a rotational vector field if p is a degree 1 vertex of z xu that is not a vertex of p then p is a critical point with nonzero index proof since p is not a vertex p lies in the interior of a side e since p is a degree 1 vertex of p the vector x p is independent of the normal derivative at p and in particular p is a critical point of u it remains to show that p has nonzero index as above we may suppose without loss of generality that e lies in the real axis and that p 0 we will consider the case in which x is a constant vector field of the form x cos x sin y where 6 2 mod suppose to the contrary that the index of p were to equal zero then by lemma 5 1 near p the function u would satisfy 21 where c 0 6 0 6 0 and k 3 is odd direct computation shows that yxu 0 2 cos c 0 and hence yxu 0 6 0 thus by the implicit function theorem there exists a function f r so that 23 xu x i f x 0 from 21 we find that for each real x 24 xu x cos c 0 k xk 1 o x k by repeatedly differentiating 23 with respect to x and using 24 we find that jxf 0 0 for each j k 1 and k 1 x f 0 6 0 since k 1 is even and greater than 0 the function f is positive in a deleted neighborhood of 0 thus there exists a neighborhood u of p 0 such that u z xu p lies in the upper half plane hence p is not a degree 1 vertex a contradiction the following lemma follows from the discussion in 7 of jdgmnd 20 we provide a statement and proof for the convenience of the reader lemma 5 3 let u be a second neumann eigenfunction on a polygon p and let p be an index zero critical point that lies in the side e if le is a constant vector field that is parallel to e then z leu intersects the interior of p and has at least two degree 1 vertices in p e proof by lemma 5 1 u has the expression u x y u 00 u 02 y 2 u 30 x 3 3 xy 2 o 4 in a neighborhood of p where u 02 6 0 if u 30 0 then proposition 7 4 of jdgmnd 20 provides the claim if u 30 6 0 then the first paragraph of proposi tion 7 6 of jdgmnd 20 provides the claim 6 critical points of second neumann eigenfunctions on simply connected polygons in this section we restrict attention to a polygon p that is simply connected and to an eigenfunction u that is associated to the second neumann eigenvalue proposition 6 1 the nodal set z u is a simple arc whose intersection with p consists of its two endpoints moreover the endpoints this arc lie in distinct side of p and z u does not contain any critical point of u critical points of laplace eigenfunctions on polygons 19 proof the first statement is a well known consequence of courant s nodal theorem and polya s inequality 6 the second statement follows from lemma 3 3 jdgmnd 20 and theorem 2 5 in chn 76 proposition 6 2 let p be a critical point p of a second neumann eigenfunction u that is not a vertex then the index ind u p equals either 1 0 or 1 proof let u be the lift of u to the double dp and let p dp correspond to p if ind u p 1 then more than four arcs in u 1 u p emanate from p it follows that in the natural coordinates at p we have u z u p o z p 2 in particular the degree two homogeneous polynomial h 2 consisting of second order terms in the taylor expansion of u at p vanishes indentically but h 2 p u p and so u p 0 this contradicts proposition 6 1 next we consider the possible indices of a critical point of u that lies at a vertex of p let ck be the coefficient in the bessel expansion 3 at a point p m the following should be compared with corollary 5 3 in jdgmnd 20 proposition 6 3 let p p either c 0 6 0 or c 1 6 0 proof if c 0 0 c 1 then by inspecting 3 one finds that at least two nodal arcs emanate from p this contradicts proposition 6 1 corollary 6 4 let v be a vertex whose angle is not a multiple of 2 1 if c 0 0 then ind u v 0 2 if 2 then c 0 6 0 if and only if v is a local extremum 3 if and c 1 0 then v is a local extremum 4 if 2 then c 1 0 if and only if v is a local extremum 5 if then ind u v 0 or ind u v 1 proof let k be the smallest positive integer such that ck 6 0 if c 0 0 then by proposition 6 3 we have c 1 6 0 and hence by lemma 4 6 we have ind u v 0 if 2 and c 0 6 0 then we are in case 2 of lemma 4 6 and hence ind u v 1 by proposition 4 5 we have ind u v 1 if and only if v is a local extremum suppose that 2 if c 1 0 then proposition 6 3 implies that c 0 6 0 and so part ii of lemma 4 6 implies that ind u v 1 if c 1 6 0 then part i of lemma 4 6 implies that ind u v 0 corollary 6 5 suppose that v is an acute vertex of p contained in the side e if v is not a local extremum then z leu has an arc that ends at v proof this follows from corollary 2 3 and corollary 6 4 7 no hot spots on certain polygons with two acute vertices ban uelos and burdzy bnl brd 99 used probabilistic methods to show that the second neumann eigenfunction u of an obtuse triangle has no interior critical points in jdgmnd 20 jdgmnd 21 a we used a variational approach to show that the two acute vertices are the only critical points of u and hence they are the global extrema of u in this section we extend this latter result to a large class of n gons that have two acute vertices at the end of the section we identify this class of polygons as 6 see for example theorem 5 2 jdgmnd 20 20 chris judge and sugata mondal those that satisfy the lip 1 condition of atrbrd 04 and which have no orthogonal sides lemma 7 1 let u be a second neumann eigenfunction on a simply connected polygon p with at least one acute vertex if u has an interior critical point then either u has at least four nonzero index critical points or there is a side e such that z leu has an arc that ends at a vertex of p proof suppose that for each side e the nodal set z leu does not have an arc that ends at a vertex thus if v is a vertex and e is a side containing v then corollary 2 3 implies that the leading bessel coefficient of u at v is nonzero in particular each acute vertex has index 1 by corollary 6 4 and each obtuse vertex is not a critical point by proposition 4 7 since u has a critical point in the interior of p for any side e the nodal set z leu has at least two degree 1 vertices in p since z leu does not have an arc that ends at a vertex of p each of the degree one vertices of z leu is a non vertex point on p by proposition 5 2 each of these degree 1 vertices is a nonzero index critical point of u thus since p has at least one acute vertex u has at least three nonzero index critical points in p since the obtuse vertices are not critical points proposition 6 2 implies that each critical point of u that lies in p has index equal to 1 0 or 1 thus it follows from proposition 4 1 that the number of nonzero index critical points of u that lies on p is even in particular u has at least four nonzero index critical points on p in the following we consider paths pt of polygons with n vertices we do not allow for two vertices to collide but we do allow for the angle of a vertex to become equal to for example a triangle t may be regarded as a quadrilateral if we declare that a point on some side of t is a vertex with angle let ut be a path of second neumann eigenfunctions associated to the path pt for each t let v t denote the number of vertices v of pt with angle not equal to such that there exists a side e of pt so that an arc in z leut ends at v let s t denote the number of nonzero index critical points of ut lemma 7 2 suppose that pt is a path of n gons such that no two sides of pt are orthogonal and pt has exactly two acute vertices for each t 0 1 let ut be an associated path of eigenfunctions if s 0 3 or v 0 1 then either s 1 3 or v 1 1 proof it suffices to show that the set a of t 0 1 such that either s t 3 or v t 1 is both open and closed in 0 1 a is open if s t 3 then lemma 4 12 implies that there exists 0 such that if s t then s s 3 hence to prove openness it suffices to assume that v t 1 and show that there exists 0 so that if s t then either v s 1 or s s 3 if v t 1 then there exists vertex v of pt a side e of pt and an arc in z leu that ends at v if the leading coefficient at v is nonzero then for s near t the leading coefficient at the corresponding vertex is also nonzero since no two sides of pt are orthogonal and since the corresponding edge and sector vary continuously in s we find from critical points of laplace eigenfunctions on polygons 21 lemma 2 1 that v s 1 for each s near t therefore we may assume that there exists a vertex v such that the leading coefficient of ut at v equals zero we may assume without loss of generality that v is an acute vertex indeed if v were obtuse with c 1 t 0 then by lemma 4 6 v would be a critical point with nonzero index if c 0 t were not to vanish at each of the two acute vertices then lemma 4 6 would imply that each of these vertices have index equal to one hence s t 3 and so s s 3 for s near t by lemma 4 12 thus we may assume that v is acute suppose that c 0 t 0 at an acute vertex v corollary 6 4 implies that ind u v 0 by proposition 4 13 the eigenfunction ut has at least two nonzero index criti cal points thus it follows from lemma 4 12 that there exists 0 such that if s t then there exist two nonzero index critical points of us that are distinct from v suppose that 0 s t if c 0 s 6 0 then since v is acute corollary 6 4 implies that ind us v 6 0 and hence s s 3 on the other hand if c 0 s 0 then corollary 6 5 implies that z leus has an arc that ends at v where e is a side adjacent to v in sum if s t then either s s 3 or v s 1 a is closed by assumption for each t 0 1 no two sides of pt are orthogonal and so the set of t such that v t 1 is closed by lemma 2 1 suppose that s tn 3 with tn t to prove that a is closed it suffices to show that either s t 3 or v t 1 if the eigenfunction ut has an interior critical point then lemma 7 1 implies that s t 4 or v t 1 thus we may assume that ut has no interior critical points by proposition 4 13 the two index 1 critical points p and p lie in p suppose that there exists a third critical point p if the index of p is nonzero then s t 3 thus in the following we assume that ind u p 0 if some acute vertex v has is not a local extremum then by corollary 6 5 an arc of z lev ends at v and so v t 1 thus we may assume that each acute vertex is a local extremum if there are three local extrema then s t 3 hence we may assume that the acute vertices correspond to the the index 1 critical points p and p because s tn 3 for each n there exists a critical point pn on a side that is distinct from p and p suppose that pn converges to a vertex v of pt whose angle does not equal then by lemma 3 3 the leading coefficient c 0 t if v is acute and c 1 t if v is obtuse equals zero if v is obtuse then corollary 4 7 implies that v is a nonzero index critical point and so s t 3 if v is acute then by corollary 6 5 we have v t 1 therefore we may assume that pn converges to a critical point p of ut that lies in the interior of a side e since p 6 p the critical point has index equal to zero thus by lemma 5 3 the graph z leut intersects the interior of pt and has at least two degree 1 vertices if one of these degree 1 vertices equals a vertex of pt then v t 1 if a degree one vertex lies in the interior of a side then it is a nonzero index critical point by proposition 5 2 and hence s t 3 since the acute vertices p are also nonzero index critical points theorem 7 3 suppose that pt is a path of n gons such that no two sides of pt are orthogonal if p 1 is an obtuse triangle then each second neumann eigenfunction of p 0 has exactly two critical points a global maximum at one acute vertex and a global 22 chris judge and sugata mondal minimum at the other acute vertex moreover the second neumann eigenspace of p 0 is one dimensional proof by the method of lemma 12 2 of jdgmnd 20 one may modify the path pt so that there exists a continuous family of second neumann eigenfunctions ut connecting any u 0 to any u 1 if u 1 is a second neumann eigenfunction for an obtuse triangle p 1 then by jdgmnd 20 jdgmnd 21 a the acute vertices are the only critical points of u 1 and in particular each is a global extremum thus proposition 4 5 and corollary 6 4 imply that the coefficient c 0 of u 1 at each acute vertex is nonzero given an acute vertex v the angle between opposite side and one of the sides adjacent to v is greater than 2 hence it follows from lemma 2 1 that for each side e of p 1 there does not exist an arc in z leu that ends at an acute vertex the obtuse vertex is not a local extremum and hence c 1 of u 1 at this vertex is nonzero thus it follows from lemma 2 1 that for each side e of p 1 no arc of z leu 1 ends at the obtuse vertex in sum s 1 2 and v 1 0 thus lemma 7 2 implies that s 0 2 and v 0 0 in particular u 0 has ex actly two nonzero index critical points and these are necessarily the global extrema of u 0 each global extremum must be an acute vertex indeed if an acute vertex v of p were not a local extremum then by corollary 6 5 we would have that z lev has an arc that ends at v where e is a side adjacent to v contradicting v 0 0 suppose that there exists a critical point p of u 0 that were distinct from the acute vertices then p has index zero and lies in a side of p 0 thus p lies in the interior of a side e of p and hence by lemma 5 3 the graph z leut intersects the interior of pt and has at least two degree 1 vertices if a degree 1 vertex p lies in the interior of a side then ind u p 6 0 by proposition 5 2 a contradiction therefore the acute vertices are the only critical points of u 0 finally we show that the second neumann eigenspace of p 0 is one dimensional let u and u be second neumann eigenfunctions of p 0 and let v be an acute vertex then there exist a a r so that a u v a u v 0 we claim that u a u a u 0 indeed if not then u would be a second neumann eigenfunction and in particular would be orthogonal to the constant functions thus both the the maximum value and the minimum value of u would be nonzero but by theorem 7 3 the acute vertex v is a global extremum of u and hence we have a contradiction we now show that the set of polygons that satisfy the hypotheses of theorem 7 3 is the interior of the set of polygons that satisfy the lip 1 condition of atrbrd 04 first we recall the notion of lip k domain let f b b r and f b b r be a pair of lipschitz functions such that f b f b f x f x for x b b and the lipschitz constant of f is at most k the domain x y f x y f x is called a lip k domain recall that if is a domain with lipschitz boundary then the outward unit normal vector p is defined for almost every p proposition 7 4 a simply connected lipschitz domain is isometric to a lip 1 domain if and only if there exists a partition of into two connected sets and so that if p p then p p 0 and if p and q then p q 0 critical points of laplace eigenfunctions on polygons 23 proof after applying an isometry we may suppose that is bounded by the graphs of the lip 1 functions f and f as above let be the graph of f and let be the graph of f suppose that p x y since f is lip 1 we have that p implies that y x and since f is lip 1 we have that p implies that y x it follows that if p p then p p 0 and if p and q then p q 0 let p n and p n be sequences such that limn p n p n equals the supremum of p q p q let w be a limit point of the sequence p n p n p n p n a computation shows that for each p we have p w 1 2 and for each p we have p w 1 2 choose coordinates in the plane so that the vector w is the vector 0 1 then for each p we have p x y where y x from this it follows that is the graph of a lip 1 function f a b r similarly is the graph of a lip 1 function f a b r because and form a partition of we have f a f a and f b f b because p is the outward normal vector for a domain we have f f corollary 7 5 a triangle t is a lip 1 domain if and only if t is not an acute triangle proof let e 1 e 2 e 3 be the sides of the triangle and let 1 2 and 3 be the associated outward normal vectors the angle between ei and ej is acute if and only if i j 0 the claim follows from proposition 7 4 proposition 7 6 suppose that pt is a path of polygons such that no two sides of pt are orthogonal and p 0 is isometric to a lip 1 domain then each pt is also isometric to a lip 1 domain note that we are allowing for the possibility that some vertices have angle for some t proof since p 0 is a lip 1 domain there exists a partition of p 0 that satisfies the criteria of proposition 7 4 in particular is the union of sides with outward unit normal vectors 1 0 j 0 the set is the union of sides with outward unit normal vectors 1 0 k 0 and these normal vectors satisfy i 0 j 0 0 and i 0 j 0 0 since no two sides of p 0 are orthogonal each inequality is strict the quantities i t j t and i t j t depend continuously in t and cannot vanish since no two sides of pt are orthogonal thus the inequalities persist for all t and thus each pt is a lip 1 domain by proposition 7 4 proposition 7 7 if p is a lip 1 polygonal domain with no two sides orthogonal then there exists a path pt of polygons with no two sides orthogonal such that p 1 p and p 0 is an obtuse triangle proof we will argue via induction on the number n of sides of p if n 3 then the claim follows from 7 5 suppose that the claim is true if a lip 1 polygon has n sides no two of which are orthogonal let p be a lip 1 polygon with n 1 sides such that no two sides are othogonal proposition 7 4 implies that the sides of p can be partitioned into sides e 1 e j and e 1 e k so that the associated outward unit normal vectors 1 j and 1 k satisfy the inequalities i j 0 24 chris judge and sugata mondal and i j 0 because p has nonempty interior by relabeling if necessary we may assume that 1 6 2 and the sides e 1 and e 2 are adjacent let v be the vertex shared by e 1 and e 2 and let v be the midpoint of the segment that joins the other two vertices of e 1 and e 2 define pt to be the polygon obtained from p by replacing v with vt 1 t v t v a straightforward computation show that both n 1 t and n 2 t are convex combinations of n 1 and n 2 and so it follows that pt is a lip 1 polygon with no orthogonal sides the polygon p 1 may be regarded as a lip 1 polygon with only n sides no two of which are orthogonal thus by the inductive hypothesis we may concatenate the path pt with another path to obtain the desired path to an obtuse triangle 8 instability via blocking in this section we provide criteria proposition 8 1 that guarantee the existence of a quadrilateral with a second neumann eigenfunction that has an unstable critical point in 9 we will construct families of quadrilaterals that meet the criteria under the assumption that these quadrilaterals have no interior critical points the statement and proof of proposition 8 1 are somewhat complicated but the basic idea is simple suppose that we have a continuous family of quadrilaterals qt with an obtuse vertex wt and sides e t and e t adjacent to wt suppose further that for the associated family of eigenfunctions ut we know that u 0 resp u 1 has only one nonvertex critical point p 0 resp p 1 that this critical point lies on the side e 0 resp e 1 and that this critical point has index 1 one might naively expect that the index 1 critical point varies continuously in t and therefore for some time t the critical point lies at the obtuse vertex wt however lemma 3 1 would then imply that c 1 0 at wt and then corollary 6 4 would imply that wt is an index 1 critical point thus the index of the critical point would abruptly change which is not possible by proposition 4 11 roughly speaking the obtuse vertex blocks the index 1 critical point under additional assumptions we show that this blocking phenomenon implies the existence of an unstable critical point proposition 8 1 let qt be a continuous family of quadrilaterals such that for each t 0 1 the quadrilateral qt has three acute vertices and the angle of the fourth vertex wt lies in 2 for each t 0 1 let et be a side of qt that is adjacent to wt so that t 7 et is continuous let ut qt r be a second neumann eigenfunction and suppose that t 7 ut is continuous suppose that 1 for each t the eigenfunction ut has no interior critical points 2 for each t each nonzero index critical point of ut either is a vertex or belongs to a side adjacent to wt 3 for each t each acute vertex of qt is a local extremum of ut 4 u 0 has exactly one nonvertex critical point and it belongs to the interior of e 0 5 u 1 has no critical points on e 1 except for the acute vertex then there exists t 0 1 such that ut has an unstable critical point proof for each t 0 1 let at be the set of critical points p of ut such that either p wt or p lies in the interior of a side of qt that is adjacent to wt we claim that there exists 0 so that for all t no element of at is within distance of an acute vertex indeed if not then there would exist t 0 1 a sequence tn t and a critical points of laplace eigenfunctions on polygons 25 sequence of critical points pn of un that converges to an acute vertex v lemma 3 1 would then imply that c 0 0 at v but this would contradict part 3 of corollary 6 4 and condition 3 above by condition 4 the set a 0 has exactly one element p 0 and it follows from proposition 4 1 that the index of p 0 equals 1 thus proposition 4 11 implies that the sum of the indices of the critical points in at equals 1 let t be the supremum of t 0 1 such that as contains exactly one nonzero index point ps for each s t it follows from proposition 4 11 that s 7 ps is continuous on 0 t and the index of each ps equals 1 moreover as s t the point ps converges to a point pt indeed if pt were to have more than one limit point as t t then since t 7 pt is continuous for t t we would have a nontrivial continuum of critical points but since qt is not a rectangle the function ut has only finitely many critical points jdgmnd 21 b proposition 4 11 implies that the index of pt equals 1 it follows that the critical point pt lies in the interior of et indeed otherwise condition 5 would imply that ps ws for some s t but this would contradict part 5 of corollary 6 4 if at contains a critical point q that is distinct from pt then q is an unstable critical point since ps is the only critical point in as for s t for the remainder of the proof we will suppose that pt is the only element of at by the definition of t there exists a sequence tn t such that atn consists of more than one nonzero index critical point since pt is the only critical point in at these points converge to pt and in particular for n sufficiently large the set atn lies in the interior of etn by proposition 6 2 each nonzero index critical point has index 1 or 1 hence since the sum of the indices equals 1 the set atn contains at least three critical points but this is impossible indeed if three critical points of utn were to lie in the interior of etn then z letnutn would have three degree 1 vertices that lie in qtn etn and in particular some degree 1 vertex would lie in the interior of a side not adjacent to wtn but this degree 1 vertex would be a nonzero index critical point by proposition 5 2 thus contradicting 2 9 breaking acute triangles along a side in this section we will construct families of quadrilaterals that satisfy the hy potheses 2 through 5 of proposition 8 1 the construction consists of 1 producing a nonempty open set n of acute triangles t such that the set of critical points of each second neumann eigenfunction u consists only of the three vertices and an index 1 critical point 2 breaking the side that contains the index 1 critical point of t n to create quadrilaterals for which each acute vertex is a critical point and for which the only sides that may contain critical points in their interior are the sides adjacent to the new obtuse vertex 3 choosing a path wt of break points so that the resulting path qt of quadri laterals forces blocking to occur we now provide the details of this construction define n to be the set of acute triangles t such that if u is any second neumann eigenfunction on t then 1 each vertex of t is a local extremum of u 26 chris judge and sugata mondal 2 u has exactly one nonvertex critical point p 3 the critical point p is nondegenerate proposition 4 1 implies that p has index equal to 1 the main theorem of jdgmnd 21 a implies that p lies on a side of t note that equilateral triangles do not belong to n and hence by a result of siudeja siudeja the second neumann eigenspace of t is one dimensional for each t n lemma 9 1 the set n is open in the space of acute triangles proof by corollary 6 4 a vertex v of an acute triangle is a local extremum if and only if u v 6 0 thus condition 1 is open a critical point p is nondegenerate if and only if the determinant of the hessian at p is nonzero and hence condition 3 is also an open condition thus if n were not open then there would exist t n and a sequence tn converging to t such that condition 2 is not satisfied for each n in particular for each n there would exist a second neumann eigenfunction un on tn with distinct nonvertex critical points pn and qn by passing to a subsequence if necessary we may assume without loss of gen erality that un converges to an eigenfunction u on t neither of the sequences pn nor qn can converge to a vertex of t because then by lemma 3 1 we would have c 1 0 contradicting 1 thus by 2 both sequences converge to the unique nonvertex critical point p of t and it would follow that p is a degenerate critical point contradicting 3 the set n is also nonempty lemma 9 2 let t be an isosceles triangle with reflection symmetry and let u be a second neumann eigenfunction of t if the angle of the apex vertex v fixed by is less than 3 then 1 each vertex is a local extremum of u 2 u has exactly one non vertex critical point p the midpoint of the side e opposite to v 3 p is nondegenerate with index 1 4 u z 6 0 for each z e proof by lemma 3 1 in miyamoto the second neumann eigenvalue of t has multiplicity one and u is symmetric with respect to it follows that the the midpoint p of the side e preserved by is a critical point let t t t be the two right triangles such that t t and t t t since u is symmetric with respect to the restriction of u to t is a second neumann eigenfunction of t by theorem 4 1 in jdgmnd 21 a the restriction of u to the right triangle t has no nonvertex critical points and each acute vertex of t is a local extremum it follows that each vertex of t is a local extremum of u and the midpoint p of e is the only other critical point of u thus theorem 4 1 implies that p has index 1 next we show that u does not vanish on e by proposition 6 1 the nodal set z u does not contain a critical point and hence does not contain the midpoint p thus if there did exist z e with u q 0 then z 6 p and hence z 6 q since u is symmetric we would have u z 0 but then z would be a second endpoint of z u that lies in e a contradiction therefore u does not vanish on e critical points of laplace eigenfunctions on polygons 27 finally by examining the taylor expansion of u about p we find that the p is non degenerate indeed without loss of generality q 0 and e lies in the x axis since u u the restriction of u to e is an even function of x in particular the taylor coefficient a 30 0 thus if p were degenerate then theorems 7 3 and 7 4 in jdgmnd 20 would imply that u has an additional non vertex critical point a contradiction next we will break each t n along the side that contains the index 1 critical point we first give a precise definition of breaking let t be a triangle 7 with vertices v 1 v 2 v 3 let e be a side of t let w be a point that lies in the interior of e and let nw be the outward pointing unit normal vector at w for each 0 define w w nw and define q t w to be the convex hull of v 1 v 2 v 3 w for 0 the polygonq t w is a nondegenerate quadrilateral we say that q t w is the result of breaking t along e at the point w at distance lemma 9 3 let t n and let e be the side of t that contains the index 1 critical point let k be a compact subset of the interior of e there exists 0 such that if 0 and w k then a the second neumann eigenfunction u of q t w is unique up to scalar multiplication b each acute vertex of q t w is a local extremum of u c if e is a side that does not contain the obtuse vertex w then the interior of e does not contain a critical point of u proof the simplicity of the second neumann eigenvalue is an open condition and the second eigenvalue of each t n is simple by siudeja it follows that there exists 0 so that a holds for each q t w with and w k corollary 6 4 implies that condition b is an open condition in particular c 0 6 0 at each acute vertex thus if the claim were false then there would exist a sequence n 0 and wn k such that qn q t wn n has a second neumann eigenfunction un with a nonvertex critical point pn on a side e that does not contain wn n the sequence qn converges to t and thus by passing to a subsequence if necessary we may assume that un converges to an eigenfunction u on t if the sequence pn e were to converge to a vertex v of t then lemma 3 1 would imply c 1 0 at v a contradiction if the sequence pn converges to a point p in the interior of e then p is a critical point of u contradicting the assumption that the unbroken sides of t contain no critical points let t k denote the supremum of all possible for which the statement of propo sition 9 3 is true for the given compact set k lemma 9 4 let t n and let e be the side of t that contains the index 1 critical point p let wt be a path in the interior of e so that w 0 and w 1 lie in distinct components of e p if k is the image of the path wt then for each 0 t k the path qt q t wt sin t has an associated path ut of second neummann eigenfunctions that satisfy the conditions 2 through 5 of proposition 8 1 7 one can easily extend the notion of breaking along a side to general polygons 28 chris judge and sugata mondal proof by the defintion of t k the quadrilateral q t wt satisfies a b and c of lemma 9 3 condition a implies that there exists a path ut of eigenfunctions of qt condition b implies that ut satisfies condition 3 in proposition 8 1 and condition c implies that condition 2 is satisfied let et be the side so that e 0 is the component of e p that contains p it follows that conditions 4 and 5 of proposition 8 1 are satisfied theorem 9 5 suppose that each convex quadrilateral has no interior critical points let t n and let e be the side of t that contains the index 1 criti cal point then for each 0 there exists 0 and w in the interior of e so that each second neumann eigenfunction u of q t w has an unstable critical point proof lemma 9 4 provides us with a family of quadrilaterals qt and second neu mann eigenfunctions ut that satisfy conditions 2 through 5 of proposition 8 1 if each second neumann eigenfuction on a quadrilaterals were to have no interior critical points then each ut would also satisfy condition 1 therefore proposition 8 1 would imply that for some t the function ut has an index zero critical point 10 second neumann eigenfunctions on convex polygons proposition 10 1 suppose that p is convex without right angles and suppose that w lies in the interior of p an arc of z rwu ends at a vertex v of p if and only if v is a local extremum of u proof if w lies in p then it lies in the interior of the sector associated to v by assumption the angle at v lies in either 0 2 or 2 the claim then follows from combining corollary 2 5 corollary 4 7 and corollary 6 4 with additional hypotheses we can expand the scope of proposition 5 2 to in clude degree 1 vertices of z rwu that are vertices of p corollary 10 2 let u be a second neumann eigenfunction of a convex polygon p with no right angles if w lies in the interior of p then each degree one vertex of z rwu is a nonzero index critical point proof each degree 1 vertex p of z rwu lies in p if p lies in the interior of an edge then proposition 5 2 applies if p is a vertex then proposition 10 1 applies proposition 10 3 let u be a second neumann eigenfunction u on a convex poly gon p if u has a critical point p that lies in the interior of p then u has at least four nonzero index critical points on the boundary in particular u has at least five critical points proof without loss of generality p 0 since p is a critical point of u we have u z u 0 a x 2 b xy c y 2 o z 3 for some constants a b and c we have rpu y x x y and hence rpu z b x 2 y 2 2 c a xy b y 2 o z 3 in particular p 0 is a nodal critical point of the laplace eigenfunction rpu thus by the result of chn 76 the valence of z rpu at p is at least four by proposition 6 2 in jdgmnd 20 the nodal set z rpu is a tree whose degree 1 vertices lie in the critical points of laplace eigenfunctions on polygons 29 boundary of p thus z rpu has at least four degree 1 vertices and each of these is a nonzero index critical point by corollary 10 2 corollary 10 4 if u has has only three critical points then each critical point lies on the boundary moreover one critical point is a global maximum one critical point is a global minimum and the third critical point has index zero proof by proposition 10 3 each critical point lies on the boundary since u is nonconstant at least two of these critical points are global extrema the index of each global extremum is 1 thus if there are exactly three critical points then it follows from proposition 4 1 that two critical points have index 1 and the third has index zero references atrbrd 04 r atar k burdzy on neumann eigenfunctions in lip domains journal of the ams 17 2 2004 243 265 1 2 20 22 bnl brd 99 r ban uelos and k burdzy on
