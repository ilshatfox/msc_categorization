1 incorporating social opinion in the evolution of an epidemic spread alejandro carballosa mariamo mussa juane and alberto p mu uzuri institute cretus group of nonlinear physics fac physics university of santiago de compostela 15782 santiago de compostela spain alberto perez munuzuri usc es attempts to control the epidemic spread of covid 19 in the different countries often involve imposing restrictions to the mobility of citizens recent examples demonstrate that the effectiveness of these policies strongly depends on the willingness of the population to adhere them and this is a parameter that it is difficult to measure and control we demonstrate in this manuscript a systematic way to check the mood of a society and a way to incorporate it into dynamical models of epidemic propagation we exemplify the process considering the case of spain although the results and methodology can be directly extrapolated to other countries 1 introduction both the amount of interactions that an infected individual carries out while being sick and the reachability that this individual has within its network of human mobility have a key role on the propagation of highly contagious diseases if we picture the population of a given city as a giant network of daily interactions we would surely find highly clustered regions of interconnected nodes representing families coworkers and circles of friends but also several nodes that interconnect these different clustered regions acting as bridges within the network representing simple random encounters around the city or perhaps people working at customer oriented jobs it has been shown that the most effective way to control the virulent spread of a disease is to break down the connectivity of these networks of interactions by means of imposing social distancing and isolation measures to the population 1 for these policies to succeed however it is needed that the majority of the population adheres willingly to them since frequently these contention measures are not mandatory and significant parts of the population exploit some of the policies gaps or even ignore them completely in diseases with a high basic reproduction number i e the expected number of new cases directly generated by one infected case such is the case of covid 19 these individuals represent an important risk to control the epidemic as they actually conform the main core of exposed individuals during quarantining policies in case of getting infected they mailto alberto perez munuzuri usc es 2 can easily spread the disease to their nearest connections in their limited but ongoing everyday interactions reducing the effectiveness of the social distancing constrains and helping on the propagation of the virus measures of containment and estimating the degree of adhesion to these policies are especially important for diseases where there can be individuals that propagate the virus to a higher number of individuals than the average infected these are the so called super spreaders 2 3 and are present in sars like diseases such as the covid 19 recently a class of super spreaders was successfully incorporated in mathematical models 4 regarding the usual epidemiological models based on compartments of populations a viable option is to introduce a new compartment to account for confined population 5 again this approach would depend on the adherence of the population to the confinement policies and taking into account the rogue individuals that bypass the confinement measures it is important to accurately characterize the infection curves and the prediction of short term new cases of the disease since they can be responsible of a dramatic spread here we propose a method that quantitatively measures the state of the public opinion and the degree of adhesion to an external given policy then we incorporate it into a basic epidemic model to illustrate the effect of changes in the social network structure in the evolution of the epidemic the process is as follows we reconstruct a network describing the social situation of the spanish society at a given time based on data from social media this network is like a radiography of the social interactions of the population considered then a simple opinion model is incorporated to such a network that allows us to extract a probability distribution of how likely the society is to follow new opinions or political directions introduced in the net this probability distribution is later included in a simple epidemic model computed along with different complex mobility networks where the virus is allowed to spread the framework of mobility networks allows the explicit simulation of entire populations down to the scale of single individuals modelling the structure of human interactions mobility and contact patterns these features make them a promising tool to study an epidemic spread see 6 for a review especially if we are interested in controlling the disease by means of altering the interaction patterns of individuals at this point we must highlight the difference between the two networks considered one is collected from real data from social media and it is used to feel the mood of the collective society while the other is completely in silico and proposed as a first approximation to the physical mobility of a population the study case considered to exemplify our results considers the situation in spain this country was hard hit by the pandemic with a high death toll and the government reacted imposing a severe control of the population mobility that it is still partially active the policy worked and the epidemic is controlled nevertheless it has been difficult to estimate the level of adherence to those policies and the repercussions in the sickness evolution curve this effect can also be determinant during the present transition to the so called new normal the manuscript is organized as follows in section 2 we describe the construction of the social network from scratch using free data from twitter the opinion model is also introduced here and described its coupling to the epidemiological model section 3 contains the main findings 3 and computations of the presented models and section 4 a summary and a brief discussion of the results with conclusions and future perspectives 2 methods 2 1 social network construction in order to generate a social network we use twitter we downloaded several networks of connections using the tool nodexl 7 introducing a word of interest nodexl brings information of users that have twitted a message containing the typed word and the connections between them the topics of the different searches are irrelevant in fact we tried to choose neutral topics with potentiality to engage many people independently of political commitment age or other distinctions the importance of each subnet is that it reveals who is following who and allows us to build a more complete network of connections once all the subnets are put together each one of the downloaded networks will have approximately 2000 nodes 8 in this way downloading as many of such subnets as possible gives us a more realistic map of the current situation of the spanish twitter network and we believe a realistic approximation to the social interactions nationwide we intended to download diverse networks politically inoffensive junction accounts will be needed to make sure that all sub networks overlap junction accounts are these accounts that are part of several subnets and warrant the connection between them if these junction accounts did not exist isolated local small networks may appear go to supplementary information to see the word of interest networks downloaded and overlapped twitter as a social network changes in time 9 10 11 and it is strongly affected by the current socio political situation so important variations in its configuration are expected with time specifically when a major crisis such as the current one is ongoing taking this into consideration we analyze two social neworks corresponding to different moments in time one represents the social situation in october 2019 with 17665 accounts which describes a pre epidemic social situation and another from april 2020 with 24337 accounts which describes the mandatory confinement period of time the networks obtained are directed and the links mark which nodes are following which so a node with high connectivity means it is following the opinions of many other nodes the two social networks obtained with this protocol are illustrated in figure 1 a first observation of their topologies demonstrate that they fit a scale free network with a power law connectivity distribution and exponents 1 39 for october 19 and 1 77 for april 20 network 12 the significantly different exponents demonstrate the different internal dynamics of both networks 4 a october 19 b april 20 c figure 1 a october 2019 twitter network b april 2020 twitter network each color marks those nodes corresponding with each word of interest subnet accounts in grey are the junction accounts links are colored with the origin node account c connectivity distribution for both networks we generate the graphs in a and b using the algorithm force atlas 2 from gephi 13 force atlas 2 is a forced directed algorithm that stimulates the physical system to get the network organized through the space relying on a balance of forces nodes repulse each other as charged particles while links attract their nodes obeying a hooke s law so that nodes that are more distant exchange less information 5 2 2 opinion model we consider a simple opinion model based on the logistic equation 14 but that has proved to be of use in other contexts 15 16 it is a two variable dynamical model whose nonlinearities are given by 1 1 1 where and account for the two different opinions as remains constant we can use the normalization equation 1 and thus the system reduces to a single equation 1 1 2 is a time rate that modifies the rhythm of evolution of the variable is a coupling constant and controls the stationary value of this system has two fixed points 0 0 and 0 being the latest stable and 0 0 unstable we now consider that each node belongs to a network and the connections between nodes follow the distribution measured in the previous section the dynamic equation becomes 17 1 1 3 each of the nodes obey the internal dynamic given by while being coupled with the rest of the nodes with a strength where is a diffusive constant and is the connectivity degree for node number of nodes each node is interacting with also named outdegree note that this is a directed non symmetrical network where means that node is following the tweets from nodes is the laplacian matrix the operator for the diffusion in the discrete space 1 we can obtain the laplacian matrix from the connections established within the network as being the adjacency matrix 1 if are connected 0 if are not connected notice that the mathematical definition in some references of the laplacian matrix has the opposite sign we use the above definition given by 17 in parallelism with fick s law and in order to keep a positive sign in our diffusive system 6 now we proceed as follows we consider that all the accounts nodes in our network are in their stable fixed point 0 from equation 6 with a 10 of random noise then a subset of accounts is forced to acquire a different opinion 1 with a 10 of random noise 1 and we let the system to evolve following the dynamical equations 3 in this case accounts are sorted by the number of followers that it is easily controllable therefore some of the nodes shift their values to values closer to 1 that in the context of this simplified opinion model means that those nodes shifted their opinion to values closer to those leading the shift in opinion this process is repeated in order to gain statistical significance and as a result it provides the probability distribution of nodes eager to change the opinion and adhere to the new politics 2 3 epidemiological model and coupling with opinion probability distribution our epidemiological model is based on the classic sir model 18 and considers three different states for the population susceptible s infected i and recovered or removed individuals r with the transitions as sketched in figure 2 figure 2 scheme of the sir model here represents the probability of infection and the probability of recovering we assume that recovered individuals gain immunity and therefore cannot be infected again we consider an extended model to account for the epidemic propagation where each node interacts with others in order to spread the virus in this context we consider that each node belongs to a complex network whose topology describes the physical interactions between individuals the meaning of node here is a single person or a set of individuals acting as a close group i e families the idea is that the infected nodes can spread the disease with a chance to each of its connections with susceptible individuals thus becomes a control parameter of how many individuals an infected one can propagate the disease to at each time step then each infected individual has a chance of being recovered from the disease a first order approach to a human mobility network is the watts strogatz model 19 given its ability to produce a clustered graph where nearest nodes have higher probability of being interconnected while keeping some chances of interacting with distant nodes as in an erd s renyi random graph 20 according to this model we generate a graph of nodes where each node is initially connected to its nearest neighbors in a ring topology and the connections are then randomly rewired with distant nodes with a probability the closer this probability is to 1 the more resembling the graph is to a fully random network while 7 for 0 it becomes a purely diffusive network if we relate this ring shaped network with a spatial distribution of individuals when is small the occurrence of random interactions with individuals far from our circle of neighbors is highly severed mimicking a situation with strict mobility restrictions where we are only allowed to interact with the individuals from our neighborhood this feature makes the watts strogatz model an even more suitable choice for the purposes of our study since it allows us to impose further mobility restrictions to our individuals in a simple way on the other hand the effects of clustering in small world networks with epidemic models are important and have been already studied 21 24 the network is initialized setting an initial number of nodes as infected while the rest are in the susceptible state and then the simulations starts at each time step the chance that each infected individual spreads the disease to each of its susceptible connections is evaluated by means of a monte carlo method 25 then the chance of each infected individual being recovered is evaluated at the end of the time step in the same manner this process is repeated until the pool of infected individuals has decreased to zero or a stopping criterion is achieved the following step in our modelling is to include the opinion model results from the previous section in the epidemic spread model just described first from the outcome of the opinion model we build a probability density where 1 represents the disagreement with the externally given opinion these opinion values are assigned to each of the nodes in the watts strogatz network following the distribution next we introduce a modified parameter which varies depending on the opinion value of each node it can be understood in terms of a weighted network modulated by the opinions it is more likely that an infection occurs between two rogue individuals higher value of rather than between two individuals who agree with the government confinement policies almost zero or very close to zero we introduce then the weight which accounts for the effective probability of infection between an infected node and a susceptible node at each time step of the simulation the infection chances are evaluated accordingly to the value of the connection and the process is repeated until the pool of infected individuals has decreased to zero or the stopping criterion is achieved in figure 3 we exemplify this process through a network diagram where white black and grey nodes represent susceptible infected and recovered individuals respectively black connections account for possible infections with chance to account for further complexity this approach could be extrapolated to more complex epidemic models already presented in the literature 4 6 26 nevertheless for the sake of illustration this model still preserves the main features of an epidemic spread without adding the additional complexity to account for real situations such as the covid 19 case 8 figure 3 diagram of the infection process in the network black links account for possible infections with weight 3 results 3 1 social network following the previous protocol we run the opinion model considering the two social networks analyzed figure 4 shows the distribution of the final states of the variable for the october 19 network orange and the april 20 network green when the new opinion is introduced in a 30 of the total population r 30 different percentages of the initial population r were considered but the results are equivalent see figure s 1 in the supplementary information direct inspection of figure 4 clearly shows that the population on april 20 is more eager to follow the new opinion political guidelines comparing with the situation in october 19 in the pandemic scenario network of april 20 it is noticeable that larger values of the opinion variable are achieved corresponding with the period of the quarantine preferential states are also observed around 0 0 5 and 1 note that the network of april 20 allows to change opinions more easily than in the case of october 19 9 figure 4 distribution of the concentrations for the twitter network from october 2019 orange and april 2020 green for a r 30 of the initial accounts in the state 1 with a 10 of noise 0 0001 0 01 0 0001 0 0 01 20000 3 2 opinion biased epidemic model during the sanitary crisis in spain the government imposed heavy restrictions on the mobility of the population to better account for this situation we rescaled the probability density of disagreement opinions to values between 0 and 0 3 leading to the probability densities of figure 5 from here on we shall refer to this maximum value of the rescaled probability density as the cutoff imposed to the probability density note that this probability distribution is directly included into de mobility model as a probability to interact with other individuals thus this cutoff means that the government policy is enforced reducing up to a 70 of the interactions and the reminder 30 is controlled by the population decision to adhere to the official opinion figure 5 probability densities of the variable 1 constructed from the distributions of figure 4 and rescaled to the values between 0 and 0 3 to account for a heavily restricted mobility 10 in figure 6 we summarized the main results obtained from the incorporation of the opinion model into the epidemiological one we established four different scenarios for the first one we considered a theoretical situation where we imposed that around the 70 of the population will adopt social distancing measures but leave the other 30 in a situation where they either have an opinion against the policies or they have to move around interacting with the rest of the network for any reason this means 0 3 for all the nodes in contrast to this situation we introduce the opinion distribution of the social networks of april 20 and october 19 finally we consider another theoretical population where at least 90 of the population will adopt social distancing measures note that in a real situation around 10 of the population occupies essential jobs and thus are still exposed to the virus however for the latter the outbreak of the epidemic does not occur so there is no peak of infection note that the first and the last ones are completely in silico scenarios introduced for the sake of comparison figure 6 a shows the temporal evolution of the infected population in the first three of the above scenarios the line in blue shows the results without including an opinion model and considering that a 70 of the population blindly follows the government mobility restrictions while the reminding 30 continue interacting as usual orange line shows the evolution including the opinion model with the probability distribution derived as in october 19 the green line is the evolution of the infected population considering the opinion model derived from the situation in april 20 note that the opinion model stated that the population in april 20 was more eager to follow changes in the opinion than in october 19 and this is directly reflected in the curves in figure 6 a also note that as the population becomes more conscious and decides to adhere to the restriction of mobility policies the maximum of the infection curve differs in time and its intensity is diminished this figure clearly shows that the state of the opinion inferred from the social network analysis strongly influences the evolution of the epidemic the results from the first theoretical case blue curve show clearly that the disease reaches practically all the rogue individuals around the 30 of the total population that we set with the rescaling of the probability density while the other two cases with real data show that further agreement with the given opinion results in flatter curves of infection spreading we have analyzed both the total number of infected individuals on the peaks and its location in time of the simulation but since our aim is to highlight the incorporation of the opinion model we show in figures 6 b and 6 c the values of the maximum peak infection as well as the delay introduced in achieving this maximum scaled with the corresponding values of the first case blue line we see that the difference on the degree of adhesion of the social networks outcomes a further 12 reduction approx on the number of infected individuals at the peak and a further delay of around the 20 in the time at which this peak takes place note that for the april 20 social network a reduction of almost the 50 of individuals is obtained for the peak of infection and a similar value is achieved for the time delay of the peak this clearly reflects the fact that a higher degree of adhesion is important to flatten the infection curve finally in the latter theoretical scenario where we impose a cutoff of 0 1 the outbreak of the epidemic does not occur and thus there is no peak of infection this is represented in figure 6 b and 6 c as a dash filled bar indicating the absence of the said peak 11 a b c figure 6 a evolution of the number of infected individuals with time for the three opinion models considered b reduction in of the infected individuals on the peak of the curve in respect to the model with fixed opinion 0 3 c time delay in of the infection peak error bars represent the standard deviation of a sample of peak statistics obtained across several simulations with the same parameters but different random configurations of the network s adjacency matrix 10000 0 05 0 06 0 25 changing the condition on the cutoff imposed for the variable can be of interest to model milder or stronger confinement scenarios such as the different policies ruled in different countries in figure 7 we show the infection peak statistics maximum of the infection curve and time at maximum for different values of the cutoffs and for both social opinion networks in both cases the values are scaled with those from the theoretical scenario with all individuals having their opinion at the cutoff value both measurements figures 7 a and 7 b are inversely proportional to the value of the cutoff this effect can be understood in terms 12 of the obtained probability densities for both networks october 19 and april 20 we obtained that most of the nodes barely changed their opinion and thus for increasing levels on the cutoff of these counts dominate on the infection processes so the difference between both networks is reduced on the other hand this highlights the importance of rogue individuals in situations with increasing levels of confinement policies since for highly contagious diseases each infected individual propagates the disease rapidly each infected individual matter and the less connections he or she has the harder is for the virus to spread along the exposed individuals note that for all the scenarios the social network of april 20 represents the optimum situation in terms of infection peak reduction and its time delay it is particularly interesting the case for the cutoff in 0 2 all simulations run for this cutoff show an almost non existent peak this is represented on figure 7 a with almost a reduction of the 100 of the infection peak the maximum value found on the infection curve was small but not zero and the value of the time delay figure 7 b is included in the shaded region since this infection curve was almost flat something similar occurs for the cutoff in 0 25 which explains the large error seen in figure 7 b note that this value of the cutoff 0 2 constitutes by itself an actual threshold bellow which no infection peak is observed a b figure 7 infection peak statistics for different values of the cutoff of and for both the opinion models october 19 in yellow and april 20 in green a reduction of the maximum in the infection curve scaled with the corresponding maximum of the least favorable case theoretical scenario where all nodes have the opinion of the cutoff b delay of the maximum in the infection curve scaled with the corresponding time for the maximum of the least favorable case again the dash filled bar represents the absence of an infection peak and the error bars represent the standard deviation of a sample of peak statistics obtained across several simulations see figure s 3 on the supplementary information for the time evolution of the infected individuals of some of the points shown here 10000 0 05 0 06 0 25 13 as discussed in the previous section we are considering a watts strogatz model for the mobility network this type of network is characterized by a probability of rewiring as introduced in the previous section that stablishes the number of distant connections for each individual in the network all previous results were obtained considering a probability of rewiring of 0 25 figure 8 shows the variation of the maximum for the infection curve and time for the maximum versus this parameter the observed trend indicates that the higher the clustering thus the lower the probability of rewiring the more difficult is for the disease to spread along the network this result is supported by previous studies in the field which show that clustering decreases the size of the epidemics and in cases of extremely high clustering it can die out within the clusters of population 21 24 this can be understood in terms of the average shortest path of the network 12 which is a measure of the network topology that tells the average minimum number of steps required to travel between any two nodes of the network starting from the ring topology where only the nearest neighbors are connected the average shortest path between any two opposite nodes is dramatically reduced with the random rewirings remember that these new links can be understood as short cuts or long distance connections within the network since the infection process can only occur between active links between the nodes it makes sense that the propagation is limited if less of these long distance connections exist in the network the average shortest path length decays extremely fast with increasing values of the random rewiring and thus we see that the peak statistics are barely affected for random rewirings larger than the 25 if one is interested on further control of the disease the connections with distant parts of the network must be minimized to values smaller than this fraction regarding the performance of both opinion biased epidemic cases we found again a clear difference between the two of them in the april 19 case the outcome of the model present always a more favorable situation to control the expansion of the epidemic stating the importance of the personal adherence to isolation policies in controlling the evolution of the epidemic a b 14 figure 8 peak statistics of the infection curves for different values of the rewiring probability of the watts strogatz model and for both opinion scenarios october 19 and april 20 see figure s 4 on the supplementary information for the time evolution of the infected individuals of some of the points shown here 10000 0 05 0 06 cutoff 0 3 4 discussion we have parametrized the social situation of the spanish society at two different times with the data collected from a social media based on microblogging twitter com the topology of these networks combined with a simple opinion model provides us with an estimate of how likely this society is to follow new opinions and change their behavioral habits the first analysis presented here shows that the social situation in october 2019 differs significantly from that of april 2020 in fact we have found that the latter is more likely to accept opinions or directions and thus follow government policies such as social distancing or confining the output of these opinion models was used to tune the mobility in an epidemic model aiming to highlight the effect that the social mood has on the pandemic evolution the histogram of opinions was directly translated into a probability density of people choosing to follow or not the directions modifying their exposedness to being infected by the virus although we exemplify the results with an over simplified epidemic model sir the same protocol can be implemented in more complicated epidemic models we show that the partial consensus of the social network although non perfect induces a significant impact on the infection curve and that this impact is quantitatively stronger in the network of april 2020 our results are susceptible to be included in more sophisticated models used to study the evolution of the covid 19 all epidemic models lack to include the accurate effect of the society and their opinions in the propagation of epidemics we propose here a way to monitor almost in real time the mood of the society and therefore include it in a dynamic epidemic model that is biased by the population eagerness to follow the government policies further analysis of the topology of the social network may also provide insights of how likely the network can be influenced and identify the critical nodes responsible for the collective behavior of the network acknowledgments this research is supported

the opinion biased models diminishes with growing values of the cutoff value on finally figure s 5 shows the effect that higher values of the rewiring probability of the watt strogatz model has in the time evolution of the infected individuals as shown in the main text lower values of the rewiring probability has an important impact on the peak of infection while values above 0 3 barely change the statistics on the said peak or fall within the error of the measurements figure s 3 evolution of the number of infected individuals with time for the epidemic model biased with the april 20 social
