analogues of the classical rayleigh fjortoft and arnold stability and instability theorems in the context of the 2 d euler equations 1 introduction the euler equations along with its variants such as navier stokes camassa holm equations were introduced and studied in a series of foundational papers by c foias d holm j marsden t ratiu e titi and others see for example 12 21 22 and references therein it has been studied intensively ever since by many authors from a wide variety of research themes looking at issues such as possible route to proving well posedness for the euler equations see 28 31 investigating the geometric structure of these equations along the lines introduced by v i arnold for the euler equations see 27 34 in turbulence modeling see for instance 6 9 and data assimilation see for example 1 and references therein amongst other topics in spite of this surprisingly little is known about stability of steady state solutions to the euler equations see however 32 even though stability theory of the classical 2 d euler equations has been extensively studied see e g 10 13 14 16 17 19 35 36 38 our objectives in this paper are to record basic stability results such as the rayleigh fjortoft and arnold stability theorems for the euler equations the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we formulate the euler equations and give preliminaries in section 3 we give analogues of the classical rayleigh and fjortoft criteria for 2 d parallel shear flows in the channel arnold s stability theorems are discussed in section 4 first we prove the version of the first and second instability theorems for the case of multi connected domains our formulation of the second stability theorem directly involves the minimal eigenvalue of the respective version of the laplacian and is based on the use of the rayleigh ritz formula next we discuss stability theorems on the 2 torus and on periodic channels and then provide some examples date september 24 2018

follows ut v u v u 0 1 2 v u divu div v 0 2 1 where v d r 2 is the so called filtered velocity and u d r 2 is the actual fluid velocity here 0 is a positive number related to the filter of the flow and v represents the transpose of the jacobi matrix of partial derivatives vi xj the pressure d r is related to the actual fluid pressure p d r as p 1 2 v 2 2 2 v 2 on domains d with a boundary d these equations are supplemented by the boundary conditions see for example 21 formula 8 27 page 65 v n 0 n v n 2 2 where n is the unit outer normal vector on d it is also possible to impose v 0 as the boundary condition we choose to not work with this as it precludes the possibility of working with steady states which are shear flows with non zero velocity on the boundary formally putting 0 gives us the euler equations ut u u p 0 divu 0 2 3 with the boundary condition u n 0 2 4 on d since div v 0 there exists a stream function such that v where y x we introduce the vorticity curl 1 2 v 2 5 applying curl to 2 1 one obtains the euler equation in vorticity form t v 0 2 6 using the fact that curl we get 1 2 where we denote by the stream function associated with velocity u i e u and and are related via the formula 1 2 we can thus rewrite 2 6 in terms of the stream function variables as t t x y y x 0 2 7 we have the following version of the kelvin circulation theorem for the euler model the proof is omitted as it is similar to the proof for the euler case which can be found for instance in 7 pp 21 22 lemma 2 1 let c be a simple closed contour in the fluid at time t 0 let ct be the contour carried along by the flow following the smoothed velocity v i e stability criteria 2 d euler 3 ct t c where t is the flow map associated with the velocity v where v satisfies 2 1 the circulation around ct is defined to be ct ct 1 2 v ds 2 8 then ct is constant in time that is d dt ct 0 remark 2 2 one of the original motivations in adding the additional term v tu to the euler equations 2 1 was to prove the kelvin circulation the orem above see 12 section 2 page 507 corollary 2 3 let d r 2 be a multiply connected bounded domain bounded by finitely many number of smooth curves d i where i 0 n then the circulation along each connected boundary curve remains constant in time i e for every 0 i n we have d dt d i 1 2 v ds d dt d i u ds 0 we shall have occasion to use the following integration by parts formula for vector valued functions d v vdx n i 0 d i v n vds d v 2 dx 2 9 here v v 1 v 2 v 2 tr v v t where t denotes the transpose and tr denotes trace i e v 2 2 i 1 xvi 2 yvi 2 equation 2 9 follows from green s identity for scalar valued functions f and g see e g 11 theorem 3 ii page 712 d f gdx n i 0 d i f n gds d f gdx 2 10 applied to each component of v and summation of the resulting identities by assumption for any v that satisfies 2 2 n v is parallel to n and v n 0 on the boundary we have v n v 0 i e we have d v vdx d v 2 dx 2 11 if v 1 and v 2 are two vector fields that satisfy 2 2 then by integrating by parts twice using formula 2 9 observing that the boundary terms vanish via 2 2 and using the fact that tr v 1 v 2 t tr v 2 v 1 t one also sees that d v 1 v 2 dx d v 1 v 2 dx 2 12 consider a steady state solution 0 curl 1 2 v 0 0 of the euler equation here v 0 0 u 0 1 2 v 0 0 1 2 0 and 0 1 2 0 in particular 0 0 0 y x 0 x y 0 0 2 13 4 y latushkin and s vasudevan and thus 0 and 0 are parallel the corresponding linearized equations for the euler model about the steady state v 0 u 0 are as follows ut v 0 u v u 0 v 0 u v u 0 0 2 14 divu div v 0 t v 0 v 0 0 2 15 t 0 x y 0 y x x 0 y y 0 x 0 2 16 where v curl 1 1 2 1 solves the system of equations curl 1 2 v div v 0 with appropriate boundary conditions 3 rayleigh and fjortoft criteria for the euler equations in this section we derive the classical rayleigh and fjortoft criteria for the euler equations see 10 sec 22 for an overview of these results for the euler equations our basic setup is the two dimensional channel infinitely long in the x direction and bounded in the y direction with walls at y a 1 and y a 2 where a 1 a 2 i e d r a 1 a 2 we work with 2 d plane parallel shear flows in the channel note that for the two dimensional euler equations on the domain d any steady state velocity of the form u 0 x y u y 0 and constant pressure p x y p 0 will solve the euler equations 2 3 where u a 1 a 2 r is any real valued smooth function and p 0 is a real constant note that the boundary condition u n 0 is automatically satisfied by a steady state of the type u y 0 we now obtain the analogous steady state for the euler equations 2 1 let v a 1 a 2 r be a real valued smooth function such that v a 1 v a 2 0 define u y v y 2 v y then u y 0 as computed and p 0 are steady state solutions of the euler equations 2 3 it can be readily verified see 24 prop 2 pp 60 that u 0 x y u y 0 v 0 x y v y 0 and x y p 0 1 2 v y 2 2 2 v y 2 3 1 note that is a function of y alone is a steady state solution to the euler equations 2 1 where u 0 1 2 v 0 since n 0 1 on the boundaries y a 1 and y a 2 n v 0 y v y 0 v y 0 since n v 0 t v y 0 1 0 0 on the boundary y a 1 and y a 2 this reduces to v a 1 v a 2 0 another way to obtain a steady state is to start with an arbitrary profile u y and compute v y by solving the ode v y 2 v y u y v a 1 v a 2 0 3 2 lemma 3 1 let v y be any smooth function satisfying v a 1 v a 2 0 and define u y v y 2 v y x y p 0 12 v y 2 2 2 v y 2 then u 0 x y u y 0 v 0 x y v y 0 and x y p 0 12 v y 2 2 2 v y 2 is a steady state solution to the euler equations 2 1 on the domain r a 1 a 2 remark 3 2 we stress that an arbitrary profile v y cannot be a steady state for the euler equations only profiles that satisfy the boundary condition v a 1 v a 2 0 can be steady states in contrast to the euler case where an arbitrary profile u y with no extra boundary conditions is a steady state for euler stability criteria 2 d euler 5 we let 0 and 0 be the steady state stream functions real valued associ ated with the respective steady state velocities u and v respectively i e we have y 0 y v y and y 0 y u y and 0 1 2 yy 0 note that 0 and 0 are functions of y alone the boundary condition v a 1 v a 2 0 implies that 0 yy a 1 0 yy a 2 0 we work with the euler equations in stream func tion formulation 2 16 linearizing 2 16 about the steady state 0 0 we obtain the linearized equation for the perturbations x y t and x y t of the stream function 2 16 of the form t 0 x y 0 y x x 0 y y 0 x 0 3 3 since we have the relation 1 2 one can consider the equation above as an equation for alone we note that this equation is supplemented by the boundary conditions no normal flow across the boundaries so v n 0 on the boundary d which are the two walls at y a 1 and y a 2 and n is the unit normal vector on d and n v is parallel to n since v we see that the boundary conditions for are t 0 on d where t is the unit tangent vector on d and n t 0 on d since 0 x 0 x 0 equation 3 3 reduces to t 0 y x x 0 y 0 3 4 on d with t 0 and n t 0 on d similar to the analysis for the euler equations see 10 sec 20 22 pp 124 133 we look for solutions to 3 4 of the form x y t y eik x ct and x y t y eik x ct 3 5 where a 1 a 2 c and a 1 a 2 c are complex valued functions of y k r is the wave number which is real in this case and c is the wave speed which is complex valued c cr ici if ci 0 this corresponds to an exponentially growing in time solution to 3 4 we will now derive an euler version of the rayleigh stability equation lemma 3 3 let u 0 x y u y 0 v 0 x y v y 0 and x y p 0 1 2 v y 2 2 2 v y 2 be a steady state solution to the euler equations 2 1 on the domain r a 1 a 2 suppose the linearized stream function equation 3 4 about this steady state has a solution of the form 3 5 with ci 0 and some k r then a 1 a 2 c satisfies the following boundary value problem 2 1 2 2 k 2 k 2 1 2 k 2 u v c 0 a 1 a 2 0 a 1 a 2 0 3 6 proof since and are related via 1 2 we have the following relation between and y 1 2 k 2 y 2 y 3 7 using 3 7 x y t y eik x ct x y t y eik x ct y 0 y v y and y 0 y u y we see that 3 4 yields k 2 v c u 0 3 8 6 y latushkin and s vasudevan the boundary conditions for are t 0 on d where the boundary corre sponds to y a 1 and y a 2 since t 1 0 on d this means that x 0 at y a 1 and y a 2 since x x y t ik y e ik x ct 0 when y a 1 and y a 2 we have the first boundary condition in 3 6 the boundary condi tion corresponding to n t 0 is computed as follows we note that n 0 1 x y y thus n y y x yy xy thus n t becomes yy xy 1 0 yy 0 thus we get that n t 0 becomes yy x y t 0 when y a 1 and y a 2 since yy x y t y eik x ct this corresponds to the second boundary condition in 3 6 using 3 7 we note that 3 8 yields 3 6 the analogous equation for the euler equation is the classical rayleigh stability equation known as the inviscid orr sommerfeld equation 25 pp 122 eq 4 6 remark 3 4 note that x y t y eik x ct y eikxe ikct x y e ikct where x y y eikx the smoothness of depends on the smoothness of if we consider to be in the space y h 4 a 1 a 2 c a 1 a 2 0 a 1 a 2 0 to solve 3 6 then we obtain a solution to 3 4 and we measure instability for 3 4 in the space y supx r x h 4 a 1 a 2 c we shall consider 3 4 as an linear evolution equation for t in the space y and obtain conditions for existence of a growing eigenmode solution i e for spectral instability to the linearized equation 3 4 for the perturbation stream function all references to instability in this subsection is to be regarded in the sense described above a solution of the form x y t y eik x ct with y with ci 0 to equation 3 4 grows exponentially in time this corresponds to spectral instability for 3 4 in space y with spectral parameter ikc we are ready to prove an analogue of the classical rayleigh s theorem for the euler equations proposition 3 5 let u 0 x y u y 0 v 0 x y v y 0 and x y p 0 12 v y 2 2 2 v y 2 be a steady state solution to the euler equations 2 1 on the domain r a 1 a 2 if the linearized stream function equation 3 4 about this steady state has solutions of the form 3 5 with ci 0 then u ys 0 for at least one point ys a 1 a 2 proof by assumption ci 0 we have v c 6 0 because v is real valued and thus 3 6 is non singular we multiply the first equation of 3 6 by the complex conjugate of integrate by parts using the boundary conditions i e the second and third equations of 3 6 to obtain 2 a 2 a 1 y 2 dy a 2 a 1 1 2 2 k 2 y 2 dy a 2 a 1 k 2 1 2 k 2 y 2 dy a 2 a 1 u y v y c y 2 dy 0 3 9 stability criteria 2 d euler 7 indeed the boundary terms vanish via the boundary conditions taking the imag inary part of 3 9 gives ci a 2 a 1 u y v y c 2 y 2 dy 0 3 10 since ci 0 this forces u ys 0 for at least one point ys a 1 a 2 we thus have that if u v 2 v does not have an inflection point in a 1 a 2 then 3 4 cannot have an exponentially growing eigensolution of the form y eik x ct example 3 6 let u y be a profile with no inflection point compute v y by solving the ode v y 2 v y u y subject to the boundary conditions v a 1 v a 2 0 the steady state thus computed with the pressure given by equation 3 1 cannot be spectrally unstable by proposition 3 5 this class of steady states include profiles u y that are symmetric about the center point with no inflection points for example u y 1 y 2 on the interval 1 1 and it also includes linear steady states such as the couette flow u y y on 0 1 we now derive an analogue of the classical fjortoft s theorem for the euler equations proposition 3 7 let u 0 x y u y 0 v 0 x y v y 0 and x y p 0 12 v y 2 2 2 v y 2 be a steady state solution to the euler equations 2 1 on the domain r a 1 a 2 if the linearized stream function equation 3 4 about this steady state has solutions of the form 3 5 with ci 0 then u y v y v ys 0 for at least one point y a 1 a 2 here ys a 1 a 2 is a point such that u ys 0 obtained in proposition 3 5 proof let vs v ys consider the real part of 3 9 and adding cr vs a 2 a 1 u y v y c 2 y 2 dy 0 3 11 we obtain a 2 a 1 u y v y vs v y c 2 y 2 dy 2 a 2 a 1 y 2 dy a 2 a 1 1 2 2 k 2 y 2 dy a 2 a 1 k 2 1 2 k 2 y 2 dy 0 3 12 since the integrands on the right hand side are non negative thus u y v y v ys 0 for at least one point y a 1 a 2 remark 3 8 note that in the proof of the above theorem since the integral in 3 11 is zero the coefficient in front of the integral in 3 11 can be replaced by any number the statement of fjortoft criterion can be generalized to the following fact for every real number z a necessary condition for instability is the existence of at least one point y a 1 a 2 such that v y z u y 0 3 13 in fact it is readily seen that the fjortoft criterion implies the rayleigh criterion by choosing points z 1 and z 2 such that v y z 1 0 and v y z 2 0 for all 8 y latushkin and s vasudevan y a 1 a 2 then fjortoft criterion says that there exists at least two points y 1 and y 2 such that u y 1 0 and u y 2 0 thereby ensuring that u y changes sign somewhere in the flow remark 3 9 we recall that fjortoft criterion for the euler equation says that a necessary condition for instability is that u y u y u ys 0 for at least one point y a 1 a 2 for the euler equations fjortoft criterion is sharper than the rayleigh criterion the fjortoft criterion was used to study steady states u y with a monotone profile and one inflection point ys if u and u u ys have the same sign everywhere in the flow then u y is a stable steady state even though it has an inflection point ys the analogous result for euler is as follows suppose we have a profile u y which is monotone and has one inflection point ys we compute v y using equation 3 2 if u y and v y v ys have the same sign everywhere then the steady state is stable for euler example 3 10 let us consider v y y y 3 on the interval 1 3 1 3 note that v is monotone with one inflection point at y 0 and v 1 3 v 1 3 0 one can compute u y v y 2 v y y y 3 6 2 y one can see that u y 6 y u y thus has one inflection point at ys 0 note that v 0 0 thus u y v y v ys 6 y y y 3 6 y 2 1 y 2 0 since 1 y 2 is everywhere positive in the interval 1 3 1 3 proposition 3 7 says that this steady state with pressure as in 3 1 is possibly unstable for the euler equations 4 arnold stability theorems for euler equations in the 1960 s v i arnold in 2 introduced a simple and beautiful idea to study nonlinear lyapunov stability of ideal fluids it relied on exploiting the underlying hamiltonian structure that the fluid model possessed together with convexity es timates on the second variation for an overview of the arnold criterion for the euler equation see for example 2 25 section 3 2 pp 104 111 3 chapter 2 section 4 pp 88 94 23 for a more mathematical perspective 37 section 1 4 section 3 page 7 36 section 4 5 pp 114 122 for a more applied perspective expanded later into the so called energy casimir method this has spawned a huge literature and has been applied widely to study the stability of various model fluid equations for a non exhaustive sample see for example 8 18 19 20 21 26 29 38 as well as the literature cited therein to the best of our knowledge however arnold s stability theorems were not recorded for the euler model and in this section we fill the gap 4 1 arnold s theorems in a multi connected domain let d r 2 be a bounded multi connected domain with the boundary d consisting of smooth curves d i where i 0 n denote the outer boundary of d by d 0 and d i i 1 n are the n inner boundaries let v 0 denote a steady state solution of 2 6 0 denote its stream function so that v 0 0 and 0 denote its vorticity so that 0 curl 1 2 v 0 1 2 0 since 0 0 0 by 2 6 we have that 0 is parallel to 0 and thus locally 0 is a function of 0 we shall impose the following global condition stability criteria 2 d euler 9 assumption 4 1 assume that there exists a differentiable function f defined on the closed interval min x y d 0 x y max x y d 0 x y such that 0 x y f 0 x y for every x y d in particular we have that 0 x y f 0 x y 0 x y and thus v 0 0 f 0 0 remark 4 2 we note that sometimes in the literature see for example 25 page 106 remark 1 the function f is written as the ratio of the vectors v 0 0 notice that f apriori can have singularities at the critical points of 0 since v n 0 on the boundary d we have on d that n 0 i e t 0 where t is the unit tangent vector on the boundary thus is orthogonal to the boundary i e each connected piece of the boundary curve is a level set of and thus d i is a constant on each connected boundary piece d i where 0 i n assumption 4 1 then implies that f 0 restricted to each connected piece d i 0 i n is a constant we shall work on the following subspace of the sobolev space x v h 3 d r 2 v 0 on d v n 0 n v n on d i 0 i n 4 1 so that u h 1 d r 2 curlu l 2 d r h 4 d r and h 2 d r the analysis proceeds by considering the following functional hc x r hc v h v q v n i 0 ai d i 1 2 v ds 4 2 and ai r for i 0 n where h q x r on x are given by h v 1 2 d v x 1 2 v x dx 4 3 q v d c curl 1 2 v x dx 4 4 and a smooth function c r r will be fixed later we note that h v is the kinetic energy of the euler fluid c is known as the casimir function the last term in 4 2 corresponds to the weighted sum of circulations along the boundary lemma 4 3 let v v t x solve the euler equations 2 1 then hc v t 1 2 d v t x 1 2 v t x dx d c curl 1 2 v t x dx n i 0 ai d i 1 2 v s t ds 4 5 is an invariant of motion that is d dt hc v t 0 proof we note that u 1 2 v and curlu curl 1 2 v we first show that d dt h v t 0 we start with the euler equations 2 1 tu v u v u 4 6 10 y latushkin and s vasudevan and use the following identity 21 eq 7 34 v u v u v u u v to rewrite 4 6 as tu v u u v 4 7 taking the dot product of 4 7 with v noting that v u v 0 and integrate over the domain d to get d ut x v x dx 0 4 8 where we used the facts that d u v vdx 0 and d vdx 0 indeed for any scalar valued function f we have f v fv f v fv 4 9 because v is divergence free v 0 and by 2 2 and divergence theorem d fv dx n i 0 d i fv nds 0 4 10 we rewrite h v as h v 1 2 d u vdx 1 2 d 1 2 v vdx 1 2 d v vdx 2 2 d v 2 dx 4 11 where in the second equality we performed integration by parts on the second term and use 2 11 equation 2 2 implies that v n v 0 using 2 2 it can also be shown that vt n 0 vt n v 0 v n vt 0 4 12 indeed 0 t v n vt n and using this and the second equation in 2 2 we see that vt n v 0 now use the fact that t v n v 0 and vt n v 0 to conclude the third equality in 4 12 recall that v 2 tr v v t also notice that 1 2 ttr v v t tr vt v t and integration by parts using the boundary conditions 4 12 yields 1 2 d ttr v v t dx d tr vt v t dx d vt vdx 4 13 we thus have by 4 8 4 11 and 4 13 d dt h v t 1 2 d v x t v x t tdx 2 2 d

dt d c x t dx 0 we use a slight variant of the following idea from 8 see appendix page 162 using 2 6 we have tc x t c x t t x t c x t v x t 4 14 and also v c x t c x t v x t therefore tc x t v c x t 4 15 using 4 9 4 10 4 14 and 4 15 we infer d dt d c x t dx d tc x t dx d v c x t dx 0 the fact that d dt d i u ds 0 i 0 n is a consequence of corollary 2 3 combining these relations proves the lemma since v 0 0 0 and v 0 is tangent to the boundary we have that 0 is orthogonal to the boundary which implies that 0 is constant on the boundary d i i 0 n i e we shall denote by 0 d i the value of 0 on the boundary d i this also implies that c 0 x y is constant for all x y d i and we shall denote this by c 0 d i we return to 4 2 we will now specify c and aj such that the first variation hc v 0 v d d hc v 0 v 0 is zero lemma 4 4 let v 0 0 be a steady state solution of 2 1 satisfying assumption 4 1 where 0 curl 1 2 v 0 let c be a smooth function so that c 0 x y f 0 x y 4 16 for every x y d let ai f 0 d i i 0 n then hc v 0 v 0 i e v 0 is a critical point of hc proof note first that hc v can be expressed using u 1 2 v as hc v 1 2 d v udx d c dx n i 0 ai d i u ds 4 17 the first variation of hc at v 0 is given by the following expression hc v 0 v d d hc v 0 v 0 1 2 d v 0 udx 1 2 d u 0 vdx d c 0 dx n i 0 ai d i u ds 4 18 where u 1 2 v and curl u we will be using the following identity see 25 eq 2 14 page 108 c 0 curl c 0 u c 0 0 u 4 19 which follows from the identity curl fv f v f curlv noting that by stokes theorem d curl c 0 u dx n i 0 d i c 0 u ds 4 20 12 y latushkin and s vasudevan we see that using 4 19 and 4 20 d c 0 dx d c 0 0 udx n i 0 d i c 0 u ds 4 21 we integrate by parts and use 2 12 thus d u 0 vdx d v 0 2 v 0 vdx d v 0 udx 4 22 using 4 22 and 4 21 we see that 4 18 is given by hc v 0 v d v 0 udx d c 0 0 udx n i 0 d i c 0 u ds n i 0 ai d i u ds 4 23 since v 0 0 0 and v 0 is tangent to the boundary this means that 0 is orthogonal to the boundary and thus 0 is a constant on the boundary this then implies that hc v 0 v d v 0 udx d c 0 0 udx n i 0 c 0 d i d i u ds n i 0 ai d i u ds 4 24 from which we see that hc v 0 v 0 provided v 0 x y c 0 x y 0 x y 4 25 ai c 0 i 0 n 4 26 since by 4 62 c is chosen such that c 0 x y f 0 x y for every x y d then v 0 0 f 0 0 c 0 0 i e 4 25 holds since we have chosen ai 0 d i for all 0 i n note that 0 is a constant on the boundary curves which then implies that ai c 0 d i then the first variation hc v 0 v 0 we denote v 22 d v x 2 dx where v 2 tr v v t we are now ready to prove arnold s first stability theorem for euler theorem 4 5 let v 0 be a steady state solution of the euler equations 2 1 on the multi connected domain d satisfying assumption 4 1 suppose that 0 inf x y d f 0 x y sup x y d f 0 x y 4 27 then there exists a constant k 0 such that if v t v 0 v t t i solves the euler equations 2 1 on d then one has the following estimate for all times t i v t v 0 22 2 v t v 0 22 t 0 22 k v 0 v 0 22 2 v 0 v 0 22 0 0 22 4 28 where 0 curl 1 2 v 0 and t curl 1 2 v t stability criteria 2 d euler 13 proof let k 1 inf x y d f 0 x y and k 2 sup x y d f 0 x y let hc be defined as in 4 2 and choose c and ai as in lemma 4 4 since the range of 0 is a connected set 4 27 is equivalent to 0 k 1 f k 2 4 29 for min x y d 0 x y max x y d 0 x y using 4 27 we may extend c from the range of 0 to r such that k 1 c z k 2 4 30 holds for every z r indeed we first extend f linearly outside min x y d 0 x y max x y d 0 x y to all of r we then choose c such that c f for all r by lemma 4 3 hc is an invariant of motion and by lemma 4 4 v 0 is a

0 x such that curl 1 2 v 0 then the value of the quadratic form reduces to d v vdx 2 d v vdx and this cannot be negative definite in the proof of arnold s stability criteria 2 d euler 15 second theorem given below we will require the quadratic form defined by 4 35 to be negative definite we would like to restrict the perturbations v to a subspace of x such that the operator curl 1 2 is one to one and thus the quadratic form 4 35 can be negative definite under appropriate assumptions on c we thus restrict the perturbation stream function to the following subspace y h 4 d r d 0 0 d i 1 2 ds 0 1 i n n n on d d i is constant 1 i n 4 36 we note that we do not specify the exact values of the constant that takes along the inner boundary curves also choose for the velocity perturbations the

v then curl 1 2 v curl 1 2 1 2 0 by lemma 4 8 we have that 0 thus v 0 remark 4 10 we comment on the rayleigh ritz formula frequently used in hy drodynamics see e g 36 lemma 4 16 page 111 let a be a

22 we can thus finish the proof as in arnold s first theorem stability criteria 2 d euler 19 4 2 arnold s theorems in a bounded simply connected domain let d r 2 be a bounded simply connected region with a smooth boundary d the functional 4 2 is now given by hc v 1 2 d v 1 2 vdx d c curl 1 2 v dx a d 1 2 v ds 4 58 lemma 4 3 holds and we impose assumption 4 1 lemma 4 4 also holds where we now set a f 0 d the expression for the second variation given in 4 34 remains unchanged theorem 4 5 also holds in this case we now expand upon remark 4 6 remark 4 12 our lemmas 4 7 4 8 and 4 9 in remark 4 6 will work where the subspace for the stream function perturbations is now y h 4 d r h 10 d r n n 0 on d and the subspace for the velocity perturba tions is x v h 3 d r 2 div v 0 in d v n 0 and n v n on d the proofs are similar and are omitted arnold s second theorem then follows as stated 4 3 arnold s second theorem on the two torus by remark 4 13 below we do not expect that arnold s first theorem holds on the two torus remark 4 13 condition 4 27 in arnold s first theorem 4 5 is never satisfied in a domain without a boundary see 25 section 3 2 page 112 to demonstrate this let us assume 4 27 then since f is monotone there exists its inverse function denoted by g i e g f 1 and since 4 27 holds one has the relationship 1 c 2 g 1 c 1 4 59 for all in the range of f 0 i e for all in the range of 0 in particular g is negative everywhere assume without loss of generality that x 0 6 0 if it is then in the argument below replace x 0 by y 0 we exclude the trivial case 0 constant everywhere in d we have that 1 2 0 0 g 0 from this we see that x 1 2 0 g 0 x 0 multiplying this by x 0 and integrating this over the domain d we get d x 0 x 1 2 0 dx d g 0 x 0 2 dx 4 60 integrating the left hand side by parts we get d x 0 x 1 2 0 dx d x 0 1 2 x 0 dx d x 0 1 2 x 0 dx d x 0 n x 1 2 0 ds but d x 0 1 2 x 0 dx d x 0 2 dx 2 d x 0 x 0 dx d x 0 2 dx 20 y latushkin and s vasudevan 2 d x

positive and the term in the right hand side is negative by 4 59 which leads to a contradiction in the absence of the boundary terms in the left hand side we consider arnold s second theorem on the two torus t 2 the hamiltonian hc is now given by hc v 1 2 d v 1 2 vdx d c curl 1 2 v dx 4 61 lemma 4 3 remains true in this setting we also impose assumption 4 1 lemma 4 4 is modified as follows lemma

critical point of hc the expression for the second variation remains the same as 4 34 the state ment of arnold s first theorem remains the same as in theorem 4 5 remark 4 6 is modified as follows remark 4 15 our space for the perturbation stream function is now given by y h 4 t 2 t 2 dx 0 4 63 and for the velocities is given by x v h 3 t 2 r 2 t 2 vdx 0 div v 0 lemmas 4 7 4 8 and 4 9 in remark 4 6 are true in this setting with minor modi fications in the proof arnold s second theorem then follows as stated in theorem 4 11 4 4 arnold s theorems on the periodic channel now we would like to for mulate arnold s theorems on the periodic channel d t 1 1 so that the boundary conditions are periodic in the x direction with boundary conditions v n and n v parallel to n at the walls y 1 and y 1 we will prove that since the domain is translationally invariant in the x direction the x momentum is con served i e we will prove that if v t v 1 t v 2 t u t u 1 t u 2 t solve the euler equation 2 1

1 1 t x 1 2 v 2 2 dxdy 0 where we integrate by parts in y and boundary terms disappear by using boundary condition 4 66 and then switch order of integration and use the fact that v 2 xv 2 1 2 v 2 2 thus 1 1 t v 2 xu 2 dxdy 0 we now look at the second term 1 1 t v 2 yu 1 dxdy t 1 1 v 2 yu 1 dydx t 1 1 yv 2 u 1 dydx t 1 1 xv 1 u 1 dydx where we integrate by parts and the boundary terms vanish

dx 4 69 by lemma 4 16 mx 2 is t independent since x 1 and x 1 are constants one can simply take the difference to be mx 2 thus in solving the poisson equation for the stream function we can set x 1 0 and x 1 mx 2 thus the following poisson problem is solved to recover the stream function from the vorticity 1 2 in d x 1 0 x 1 mx 2 4 70 since this must hold for both the steady state 0 and the perturbed flow 0 we see that the poisson equation satisfied by the perturbation stream function satisfies dirichlet boundary conditions 1 2 in d x 1 0 x 1 0 4 71 the subspace for the perturbation stream function is now as follows y h 4 t 1 1 r x 1 0 x 1 0 yy x 1 0 yy x 1 0 one then defines the subspace for the perturbations of velocity as x v h 3 t 1 1 r 2 div v 0 v n 0 and n v n on y 1

unique solution to v via lemma 4 7 thus we see that d 1 2 dx d dx 2 d v 2 dx d v vdx 2 d v 2 dx 0 from which we conclude that v 0 it follows by lemma 4 7 that 0 on d and hence 0 then is a constant and is equal to 0 by 4 73 lemma 4 9 follows as stated and arnold s second theorem also follows as stated remark 4 17 the stability results considered above implicitly assume that a solution exists for all times t if not then one has the stability estimate for all times for which the solution exists this is sometimes referred to in the literature as conditional stability see for example 23 page 7 4 5 examples example 4 18 plane parallel shear flows and inflection points 1 suppose we have a plane parallel shear flow on t l 1 l 2 induced by the profile v 0 v y 0 with v l 1 v l 2 0 u 0 u y 0 where u v 2 v we assume that u y has no inflection point on l 1 l 2 i e u y 6 0 for every y l 1 l 2 we compute f 0 x y v y u y therefore as long as u y 6 0 we can always move to a reference frame where v has the same sign as u i e find a constant c such that v y c has the 24 y latushkin and s vasudevan same sign as u thus one can see that f satisfies 4 29 and one has stability of this steady state by arnold s first stability theorem 4 5 we thereby have a sufficient condition for stability for a shear flow v where u does not have any inflection point rayleigh criterion for euler see proposition 3 5 and example 3 6 guarantees linear stability for flows such that u has no inflection point arnold s stability theorem 4 5 guarantees nonlinear lyapunov stability in the norm in 4 51 thus generalizing appropriately the rayleigh criterion 2 consider now plane parallel shear flows v such that u v 2 v has inflection points but v and u have the same sign everywhere we can also prove stability of a steady state v 0 v y 0 with v l 1 v l 2 0 u 0 u y 0 where u v 2 v such that u changes sign but v y u y has the same sign then the ratio f 0 x y v y u y is positive everywhere and one obtains stability of this steady state by arnold s first stability theorem 4 5 note that this generalizes the fjortoft criterion see proposition 3 7 and example 3 9 which guaranteed linear stability of these steady states example 4 19 effect of regularization this example illustrates the effect of regularization on the arnold criterion we present an example such that the arnold stability theorem 4 5 can be applied to conclude stability of the steady states for euler for every 0 but the corresponding arnold theorem for euler cannot be applied to conclude stability of the steady state for euler equation obtained formally by putting 0 in the steady states for the euler suppose we have a plane parallel shear flow on t l 1 l 2 induced by a profile v 0 v y 0 with v l 1 v l 2 0 u 0 u y 0 where u v 2 v let 0 be the stream function of velocity v 0 i e v y 0 y the boundary condition v l 1 v l 2 0 implies that 0 l 1 0 l 2 0 also assume that 0 1 2 0 thus f 1 2 notice that 0 curl 1 2 v 0 u y thus 0 y 1 2 yy v y y 1 2 yy y 0 2 0 0 since 0 1 1 2 0 we see that 0 must satisfy the following differential equation 2 0 0 1 1 2 0 0 0 l 1 0 l 2 0 4 75 choose the difference l 2 l 1 in such a way that has minimum eigenvalue 1 on the appropriate space y thus 1 2 will have minimum eigenvalue 1 2 since we have the inequality 1 min 1 1 2 f 1 2 for all 0 by arnold s second stability theorem 4 11 one has stability of this steady state for all values of 0 notice that if we put 0 and consider this as a steady state for the euler equations 0 0 and 0 1 2 0 becomes 0 0 thus f 1 and since the minimum eigenvalue of in the appropriate subspace is 1 the inequality 1 min f cannot be checked and stability of this steady state cannot be concluded by arnold s second stabilty theorem for the euler equations in fact stability holds in a restricted sense if perturbations are restricted to certain subspace see 25 p 111 for more details example 4 20 sinusoidal flows one class of steady states for which the regular ization seems to have no effect in terms of the arnold criterion are the oscillating si nusoidal flows i e steady states of the form 0 y sin y and 0 y sinmy where m 1 is an integer the arnold stability theorems cannot be used to conclude stability criteria 2 d euler 25 stability of these steady states for both euler and euler consider the domain to be the two torus t 2 for example if 0 y sin y then v 0 y cos y 0 u 0 y 1 2 yy v 0 y 1 2 cos y 0 0 y y 1 2 cos y 1 2 sin y from this we can see that f 1 1 2 and in order to check for stability we need 1 min 1 1 2 which does not hold because min of the op erator 1 2 with domain y as in equation 4 63 is equal to 1 2 one thus cannot conclude stability via arnold s second theorem 4 11 we note here the regularization does not have any effect whatsoever because for the eu ler equation if 0 y sin y u 0 cos y 0 0 y sin y thus f 1 and min of the negative laplacian acting on the appropriate subspace is also 1 and thus one cannot check that 1 f min which is required for stability thus the regularization doesn t seem to affect the ability of arnold criterion to predict the stability of the steady state sin y similarly if 0 y sinmy then v 0 y m cosmy 0 then u 0 y 1 2 yy v 0 y m 1 2 m 2 cosmy 0 0 y ym 1 2 m 2 cosmy m 2 1 m 2 2 sinmy from this we can see that f 1 m 2 1 m 2 2 one can check that the minimum eigenvalue of 1 2 on the subspace y described in section 4 3 is given by 1 2 thus in order to check for stability we need 1 min 1 1 2 f 1 m 2 1 m 2 2 this inequality cannot be checked for m 1 and thus one cannot conclude stability by arnold s second stability theorem 4 11 we note here the regularization does not have any effect whatsoever because for in the case of the euler equation if 0 y sinmy u 0 m cosmy 0 0 y m 2 sinmy thus f 1 m 2 and min of the negative laplacian acting on the appropriate subspace is also 1 thus we need to check if 1 1 m 2 which cannot be true if m 1 and thus simi lar to the euler criterion even for the euler case stability cannot be concluded via the arnold s second stability theorem thus the regularization doesn t seem to affect the ability of arnold criterion to predict the stability of the steady state sinmy this leads us to conjecture that these steady states are unstable even for the regularized euler equations for more regarding stability of sinusoidal flows for the euler equations see 5
