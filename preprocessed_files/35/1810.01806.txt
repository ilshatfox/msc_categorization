singularity joseph david alexander nolte and julie sherman abstract in this paper a boundary value problem for the 3 d wave equation with caputo and bessel operators is investigated sufficient conditions on the initial data are established for the existence of a unique solution to the considered problem 1 introduction the field of fractional calculus is concerned with the investigation of integrals and derivatives of arbitrary orders the basic concepts had been speculated upon by mathematicians such as leibniz and euler but it was not until about 30 years ago that fractional calculus gained specialized interest this interest grew as applications of fractional calculus to physics biology engineering and other fields were discovered and developed see 3 6 today there are numerous books and conferences devoted solely to fractional calculus and its applications see 7 9 the study of fractional diffusion wave equations fdwes is a subfield of fractional calculus that arises when one substitutes the first and second order time derivatives in the diffusion and wave equations respectively with a fractional derivative of order 0 2 in see 10 mainardi defined the fractional diffusion and fractional wave equations in two dimensions by u t c 2 x 2 where fractional diffusion is when 0 1 and the fractional wave equation is when 1 2 and c 0 note that the fractional derivative u t has several definitions such as those by caputo riemann liouville weyl and riesz see 7 11 12 fdwes have been shown to model many processes more accurately than classical equations and thus it is desirable to find analytical and numerical solutions 21 the current literature contains many papers concerned with solving fdwes of various forms some of these differences include the boundary conditions whether the problem is being considered in arbitrary dimension and the definition of fractional derivative used see 13 18 it has also been considered when the wave equation slightly modified such as having a finite linear combination of time fractional derivatives see 16 or where the constant term is replaced by a function of a given form see 19 we note works 22 23 where direct and inverse problems for pde with caputo and bessel operators were investigated in this paper we will be consider the following partial differential equation cd 0 tu x y t uxx 1 x ux uyy f x y t 1 of fractional order 1 2 defined on x y t 0 x y 1 0 t t with boundary conditions lim x 0 xux 0 u 1 y t 0 2 u x 0 t 0 u x 1 t 0 3 and initial conditions u x y 0 x y ut x y 0 x y 4 for definitions see section 2 we will find a formal solution prove uniqueness establish sufficient conditions for existence and prove continuous dependence on initial conditions a variant of the system we consider with zero initial conditions has appeared in 14 though this paper only writes down a formal solution the generality of our system proofs of uniqueness existence and continuous dependence are original furthermore this paper is purposefully written with an attention to detail aiming to be accessible to mathematicians interested in fractional derivatives but without an in depth background in fractional calculus the paper is structured as followed in section 2 basic definitions and properties of the mittag leffler function and caputo fractional derivative are given as well as a proof of the solution to a cauchy problem that arises in finding a formal solution to our fdwe in section 3 a formal solution to the problem obtained using the method of separation of variables in section 4 the uniqueness of the solution is proved in section 5 sufficient conditions for the existence of the solution are determined lastly in section 6 continuous dependence of our solution on the initial conditions is shown 1 http arxiv org abs 1810 01806 v 1 a boundary value problem for the 3 d fractional wave equation with singularity 2 2 preliminaries 2 1 basic definitions the caputo fractional derivative operator of order where n n and n 1 n is defined by cd atg x 1 n x a g n z dz x z 1 n in this paper we will be working with the specific case of 1 2 and a 0 giving cd 0 tg x 1 2 x 0 g z dz x z 1 5 it has the following relationship with the reimann liouville fractional derivative see 11 eq 2 166 cd axy x rl d axy x n 1 k 0 y k a k 1 x a k 6 where rld atg x 1 n dn dxn x a g z dz x z 1 n is the riemann liouville fractional derivative operator of order where n n and n 1 n an important function in the solution of many differential equations involving fractional derivatives is the mittag leffler function a generalization of the exponential function it is defined for all 0 and r by e z k 0 zk k and has the useful properties that rld 0 tt k 1 e k t t k 1 e k t r 0 7 11 eq 1 82 and for 0

all 0 1 z 0 z t 1 e t t 1 dt z 1 e z 11 11 eq 1 100 where by standard convention 1 0 is understood to be 0 finally the mittag leffler function has the following bound given in 11 eq 1 148 e z c 1 z 12 which holds for 2 all real and for all z c such that arg z for some with 2 min note in particular that this holds for all real z for any 2 we will also come across the bessel functions in our paper for all p z the bessel function of the first kind of order p is defined by the series jp x m 0 1 m m 1 p m 1 x 2 p 2 m 13 2 a boundary value problem for the 3 d fractional wave equation with singularity 3 also the bessel function of the second kind of the 0 th order is given by the series y 0 x 2 j 0 x ln x 2 c 2 m 1 1 m m 2 x 2 2 m m k 0 1 m 14 where c 0 is euler s constant 20 we will make use of a number of special properties of the bessel functions first direct calculations show that j 0 0 1 and jn 0 is finite for all n z additionally j 0 is known to be bounded see for instance 20 ch 8 section 9 by 20 eq 7 9 7 10 for all p r jp 1 x jp 1 x 2 d dx jp x 15 jp 1 x jp 1 x 2 p x jp x 16 additionally for any p r d dx xpjp x x pjp 1 x 17 d dx x pjp x x pjp 1 x 18 which are 20 eq 7 1 7 2 facts about the zeros of the bessel function and bounds that can be placed on its integrals will become relevant in section 5 and will be given as needed 2 2 cauchy problem the cauchy problem given by the fractional differential equation cd 0 ty x y x f x x 0 1 r 19 with initial conditions y 0 b 0 y 0 b 1 20 appears repeatedly when solving time related systems in the problem considered in this paper our aim is to show that for 1 2 y x b 0 e 1 x b 1 xe 2 x x 0 x t 1 e x t f t dt 21 is a solution to 19 which satisfies 20 the following solution is also available for example in 3 substituting 21 to the fractional derivative yields cd 0 ty x cd 0 t b 0 e 1 x c d 0 t b 1 xe 2 x c d 0 t x 0 x t 1 e x t f t dt 22 consider the first term of 22 we will show that cd 0 t b 0 e 1 x b 0 e 1 x 0 using relation 6 with n 2 and a 0 demonstrates that cd 0 t b 0 e 1 x b 0 rld 0 t e 1 x e 1 x x 0 1 x d dx e 1 x x 0 2 x 1 from property 7 with k 0 and 1 we have rld 0 t e 1 x x e 1 x thus cd 0

b 0 e 1 x b 0 x e 1 x 1 1 b 0 x k 0 x k k 1 1 1 b 0 x 1 1 2 x 1 x 1 b 0 1 1 x 1 b 0 k 0 x k k 1 b 0 e 1 x indeed cd 0 t b 0 e 1 x b 0 e 1 x 0 so the problem is reduced to showing that b 1 xe 2 x x 0 x t 1 e x t f t dt is a solution to 19 consider cd 0 t b 1 xe 2 x again we will show that cd 0 t b 1 xe 2 x b 1 xe 2 x 0 use relation 6 with n 2 and a 0 to see cd 0 t b 1 xe 2 x b 1 rld 0 t xe 2 x xe 2 x x 0 1 x d dx xe 2 x x 0 2 x 1 b 1 rld 0 t xe 2 x e 2 x x 0 2 x 1 b 1 rld 0 t xe 2 x x 1 2 further by property 7 with k 0 and 2 rld 0 t xe 2 x x 1 e 2 x thus cd 0 t b 1 xe 2 x b 1 x 1 e 2 x 1 2 b 1 x 1 k 0 x k k 2 1 2 b 1 x 1 1 2 x 2 2 x 2 2 1 2 b 1 x 1 2 x 2 b 1 x k 0 x k k 2 b 1 xe 2 x indeed cd 0 tb 1 xe 2 x b 1 xe 2 x 0 so the problem is further reduced to showing that x 0 x t 1 e x t f t dt is a solution to 19 4 a boundary value problem for the 3 d fractional wave equation with singularity 5 by the definition 5 cd 0 t x 0 x t 1 e x t f t dt 1 2 x 0 1 x t 1 d 2 dt 2 t 0 t z 1 e t z f z dz dt 23 we will need the following well known equation d dx x 0 f x t dt f x x x 0 d dx f x t dt 24 we proceed by evaluating the derivative that appears in 23 by 24 d dt t 0 t z 1 e t z f z dz t t 1 e t t f t t 0 d dt t z 1 e t z f z dz t 0 d dt t z 1 e t z f z dz to simplify the integrand on the right hand side use 7 with 1 k 0 and to see d dt t 0 t z 1 e t z f z dz t 0 t z 2 e 1 t z f z dz now we want to consider the second derivative d 2 dt 2 t 0 t z 1 e t z f z dz d dt t 0 t z 2 e 1 t z f z dz by changing variables so that z t z and applying 24 d 2 dt 2 t 0 t z 1 e t z f z dz d dt t 0 z 2 e

t f 0 t 0 d dt z 2 e 1 z f t z dz dt 29 1 2 x 0 1 x t 1 t 2 e 1 t f 0 dt x 0 1 x t 1 t 0 d dt z 2 e 1 z f t z dzdt 30 consider the first term of 30 by 11 with 2 and 1 we obtain 1 2 x 0 1 x t 1 t 2 e 1 t f 0 dt f 0 e 1 x finally consider the second term of 30 in the inner integral change variables by z t z to see 1 2 x 0 1 x t 1 t 0 z 2 e 1 z d dt f t z dzdt 1 2 x 0 x t 1 t 0 t z 2 e 1 t z f z dzdt 5 a boundary value problem for the 3 d fractional wave equation with singularity 6 now by fubini s theorem 1 2 x 0 x t 1 t 0 t z 2 e 1 t z f z dzdt 1 2 x 0 f z x z x t 1 t z 2 e 1 t z dtdz in the inner integral setting t z yields 1 2 x z x t 1 t z 2 e 1 t z dt 1 2 x z 0 x z 1 2 e 1 d using 11 again with 2 and 1 and z x z demonstrates 1 2 x z x t 1 t z 2 e 1 t z dt e 1 x z thus from equation 23 we now have cd 0 t x 0 x t 1 e x t f t dt f 0 e 1 x x 0 f z e 1 x z dz after using integration by parts on the above integral we see x 0 f z e 1 x z dz f z e 1 x z x 0 x 0 f z d dz e 1 x z dz f x e 1 0 f 0 e 1 x x 0 f z d dz e 1 x z dz f x f 0 e 1 x x 0 f z d dz e 1 x z dz we have now reduced 23 to cd 0 t x 0 x t 1 e x t f t dt f x x 0 f z d dz e 1 x z dz thus it remains only to show that x 0 f z d dz e 1 x z dz x 0 x z 1 e x z f z dz 0 31 indeed by 8 d dz e 1 x z x z 1 e x z so 31 holds finally we have seen that 21 is a solution to 19 it remains to show that y 0 b 0 y 0 b 1 certainly y 0 b 0 e 1 0 b 1 0 e 2 x 0 0 0 t 1 e 0 t f t dt b 0 further y 0 d dx b 0 e 1 x x 0 d dx b 1 xe 2 x x 0 d dx x 0 x t 1 e x t f t dt x 0 32 6 a boundary value problem for the 3 d fractional wave equation with singularity 7 consider the first term of 32 by 8 d dx b 0 e 1 x b 0 x 1 e x evaluating at x 0 yields d dx b 0 e 1 x x 0 0 thus 32 is reduced to y 0 d dx b 1 xe 2 x x 0 d dx x 0 x t 1 e x t f t dt x 0 33 considering the first term of 33 shows d dx b 1 xe 2 x x 0 b 1 x d dx e 2 x x 0 b 1 e 2 x x 0 b 1 finally consider the last term of 33 by the fundamental theorem of calculus d dx x 0 x t 1 e x f t dt x 0 x x 1 e x x f x x 0 0 thus we also have that y 0 b 1 therefore 21 is a solution to 19 20 3 problem formulation and formal solution we will be considering the system given by 1 4 in this paper we search for solutions of the form u x y t v x y t w x y t here v x y t satisfies the homogeneous problem given by the differential equation cd 0 tv x y t vxx 1 x vx vyy 34 with boundary and initial conditions lim x 0 xvx 0 v 1 y t 0 35 v x 0 t 0 v x 1 t 0 36 v x y 0 x y vt x y 0 x y 37 and w x y t satisfies the non homogeneous problem with homogeneous boundary conditions given by the differential equation cd 0 tw x y t wxx 1 x wx wyy f x y t 38 with boundary and initial conditions lim x 0 xwx 0 w 1 y t 0 39 w x 0 t 0 w x 1 t 0 40 w x y 0 0 wt x y 0 0 41 once we have found such v x y t and w x y t then u x y t v x y t w x y t will be a solution to the original problem 3 1 homogeneous problem consider the homogeneous problem given by 34 37 we use the method of separation of variables suppose u x y t z x y t t then z x y cd 0 tt t zxx x y t t 1 x zx x y t t zyy x y t t using the fact that we are searching only for nonzero solutions we rearrange to see that cd 0 tt t t t zxx x y 1 x zx x y zyy x y z x y 42 7 a boundary value problem for the 3 d fractional wave equation with singularity 8 here the left hand side depends only on t and the right hand side depends only on x and y the only way for these to be equal for all x y and t is for each to be constant we denote such a constant by we now search for solutions to the spatial problem given by 42 zxx x y 1 x zx x y zyy x y z x y 0 we now apply the method of separation of variables for the spatial problem suppose z x y is of the form x x y y then x x y y 1 x x x y y x x y y x x y y 0 using the fact that we are searching for nonzero solutions we rearrange to see that y y y y x x 1 x x x x x x x 43 where is a constant by the same argument as in 42 next consider the function y y combining 43 and 36 we see that d 2 dy 2 y y y y 0 and that y satisfies y 0 y 1 0 it is well known and simple to verify that this problem has nontrivial solutions yn y sin n y and n n 2 where n varies over n now consider the function x x from 35 and 43 we see that x must satisfy d 2 dx 2 x x 1 x d dx x x x x 0 and the boundary condition x 1 lim x 0 x d dx x x 0 note that this is bessel s equation with p 0 by 20 ch 8 section 5 x must have the form x x c 1 j 0 1 2 x c 2 y 0 1 2 x denote 1 2 we now apply the boundary condition at 0 with the goal of eliminating the y 0 term taking the limit as x 0 and applying 15 shows that lim x 0 x d dx x x lim x 0 x d dx c 1 j 0 x c 2 y 0 x lim x 0 c 1 x d dx j 0 x c 2 x d dx y 0 x lim x 0 c 1 x j 1 x j 1 x 2 c 2 x d dx y 0 x and since j 1 j 1 are bounded at 0 lim x 0 c 2 x d dx y 0 x we now use the representation of y 0 given by 14 term by term differentiating yields that lim x 0 c 2 x d dx y 0 x lim x 0 c 2 x d dx 2 j 0 x ln x 2 c 2 m 1 1 m m 2 x 2 2 m 1 1 2 1 3 1 m lim x 0 2 c 2 x d dx j 0 x ln x 2 c j 0 x x m 1 m 1 m m 2 x 2 2 m 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 m 2 c 2 lim x 0 x d dx j 0 x ln x 2 c j 0 x m 1 m 1 m m 2 x 2 2 m 1 1 2 1 3 1 m 8 a boundary value problem for the 3 d fractional wave equation with singularity 9 now since the summation term clearly converges uniformly we can swap the limit and summation since every term of the summand is 0 at x 0 we obtain lim x 0 c 2 x d dx y 0 x 2 c 2 lim x 0 x d dx j 0 x ln x 2 c j 0 x 2 c 2 lim x 0 x j 1 x j 1 x 2 ln x 2 c j 0 x 2 c 2 lim x 0 j 0 x the last equality follows from jn 0 being finite for all integer n and the fact that limx 0 x ln x 0 finally we know that j 0 0 1 therefore lim x 0 x d dx x x 2 c 2 to satisfy the condition limx 0 xx x 0 we must have c 2 0 thus x x must have the form c 1 j 0 x to satisfy the condition x 1 0 we must have that is a zero of j 0 x denoting the m th zero of j 0 x by m we obtain the general solution xm x cmj 0 mx where m varies over n finally we turn to the time problem given by our separation of variables cd 0 tt t t t 0 combining the results from the previous two sections we see that the only possible values of are given by m n n 2 2 m where m and n are natural numbers this is the cauchy problem discussed in section 2 2 with m n and f x 0 hence a general solution for any given m n is given by tm n t am ne 1 m nt bm nte 2 m nt where am n and bm n are constants bringing together the results from our separations of variables we see that our solution to the homogeneous problem must have the form u x y t m n n cm ne 1 t dm nte 2 t j 0 mx sin n y where cm n and dm n are constants we now determine these coefficients by applying our initial conditions since the bessel functions j 0 are orthogonal with weight x we use the l 2 inner product with weight x throughout this process and the rest of the paper since x is positive continuous and only zero at a single point this is an equivalent inner product to the standard one at t 0 x y u x y 0 m n n cm ne 1 0 0 dm ne 2 0 j 0 mx sin n y m n n cm nj 0 mx sin n y the last equality is due to the fact that e 1 0 k 1 0 k k 1 1 1 1 44 now for any l k n by taking the l 2 inner product with j 0 lx sin k y and using the orthogonality of 9 a boundary value problem for the 3 d fractional wave equation with singularity 10 j 0 mx sin n y we see that x y j 0 lx sin k y m n n cm nj 0 mx sin n y j 0 lx sin k y m n n cm nj 0 mx sin n y j 0 lx sin k y cl k j 0 lx sin k y j 0 lx sin k y cl k j 0 lx sin k y 22 hence for any l k n cl k x y j 0 lx sin k y j 0 lx sin k y 22 1 j 0 lx sin k y 22 1 0 1 0 x x y j 0 lx sin k y dxdy 45 to deduce the values of dm n we use 8 and note that e 2 0 k 0 0 k k 2 1 2 1 46 then applying our initial condition x y d dt u x y t t 0 d dt m n n cm ne 1 t dm nte 2 t j 0 mx sin n y t 0 m n cm n d dt e 1 t dm n d dt te 2 t t 0 j 0 mx sin n y m n cm n t 1 e t dm n t d dt e 2 t e 2 t t 0 j 0 mx sin n y m n dm nj 0 mx sin n y by identical reasoning to that used when determining the cm n we see that for any l k n dl k 1 j 0 lx sin k y 22 1 0 1 0 x x y j 0 lx sin k y dxdy 47 this fully characterizes the solution to the homogeneous problem 3 2 non homogeneous problem now we tackle the remaining non homogeneous problem given by 38 and 39 41 the first step in this process will be to represent the source function f x y t in a summation of the form m n c t j 0 mx sin n y to do this we will need the following well known lemma lemma 1 if fn n n and gm m n are complete orthonormal families in l 2 0 1 then fngm m n n is a complete orthonormal family in l 2 0 1 0 1 proof let fn n n and gm m n be complete orthonormal sets in l 2 0 1 a family of orthonormal elements a of a hilbert spaceh is complete if and only if the closure of the set of finite linear combinations of is h since an element x h is in the closure of the set of finite linear combinations of if and only if the parsevall identity x 2 x n 2 10 a boundary value problem for the 3 d fractional wave equation with singularity 11 holds it suffices to show that the parsevall identity holds for a dense subset of l 2 0 1 0 1 we consider the family c 0 1 0 1 which is dense in l 2 0 1 0 1 by the compactness of 0 1 0 1 so let f c 0 1 0 1 then f 2 f f 1 0 1 0 f x y 2 dxdy 1 0 n n 1 0 f x y fn x dx 2 dy by completeness of fn n n 1 0 1 0 f x y fn x dx 2 dy since the sum converges to fy m n n 1 0 1 0 f x y fn x dxgm y dy 2 by completeness of gm m n n f fngm 2 which shows that fngm n m n is complete in l 2 0 1 0 1 note that continuity of f and the compactness of 0 1 0 1 was tacitly used to guarantee the existence of all integrals that appear in the calculation since the trigonometric family of polynomials of period 1 and bessel functions of the 0 th kind are each complete in l 2 0 1 the family of functions given by their products is dense in l 2 0 1 0 1 hence we can represent f x y t and any solution u x y t by f x y t m n n fm n t j 0 mx sin n y 48 u x y t m n n tm n t j 0 mx sin n y 49 here note that the fm n are determined and fm n t 1 j 0 mx sin n y 22 1 0 1 0 xf x y t j 0 mx sin n y dxdy 50 now plugging into the differential equation for the nonhomogenous case yields cd 0 t 2 x 2 1 x x 2 y 2 m n n tm n t j 0 mx sin n y m n n fm n t j 0 mx sin n y 51 by the computations done in the homogeneous case we see that 2 x 2 1 x x 2 y 2 m n n tm n t j 0 mx sin n y m n n tm n t n 2 2 m j 0 mx sin n y 52 combining 51 and 52 and noting that m n n 2 2 m we obtain that m n n cd 0 ttm n t m ntm n t j 0 mx sin n y m n n fm n t j 0 mx sin n y now for any l k n taking inner products with j 0 lx sin k y and using the convergence of sums and linearity of the inner product shows that m n n cd 0 ttm n t m ntm n t j 0 mx sin n y j 0 lx sin k y m n n fm n t j 0 mx sin n y j 0 lx sin k y 11 a boundary value problem for the 3 d fractional wave equation with singularity 12 using the orthogonality of j 0 lx sin k x shows that for all m n n cd 0 ttm n t m ntm n t fm n t which is the cauchy problem described in section 2 2 with m n and f t fm n t hence we see that tm n t bm ne 1 m nt cm nte 2 m nt t 0 t 1 e m n t fm n d where bm n are constant we now determine these coefficients since u x y 0 0 and 0 0 t 1 e m n t fm n d 0 49 and 44 give that 0 u x y 0 m n n bm ne 1 0 0 cm ne 2 0 j 0 mx sin n y m n n bm nj 0 mx sin n y since the family of functions j 0 mx sin n y are orthogonal this shows that the bm n must be identically 0 to handle the values of cm n first note that d dt t 0 t 1 e m n t fm n d t 0 t t 1 e m n t t fm n t t 0 t 0 t t 1 e m n t f d t 0 0 then the fact that ut x y 0 0 combined with 46 51 and identity 8 gives that 0 ut x y 0 m n bm n d dt e 1 m nt cm n d dt te 2 m nt t 0 j 0 mx sin n y m n bm n m nt 1 e m nt cm n t d dt e 2 m nt e 2 m nt t 0 j 0 mx sin n y m n cm nj 0 mx sin n y as before since j 0 mx sin n y is an orthogonal family of functions the constants cm n must be identically 0 this now gives us a final solution to the nonhomogeneous problem u x y t m n n t 0 t 1 e m

53 tm n t cm ne 1 m nt dm nte 2 m nt t 0 t 1 e m n t fm n d 54 where cm n dm n and fm n are given by 45 47 and 48 respectively 4 uniqueness 12 a boundary value problem for the 3 d fractional wave equation with singularity 13 we claim that any continuous solution to the problem 1 2 4 must be unique to see this suppose that u x y t and u x y t solved this problem then their difference s x y t u

as we were in the nonhomogeneous problem with f x y t 0 the argument we used in the nonhomogeneous case now shows that s x y t m n n t 0 t 1 e m n t 0 d j 0 mx sin n x 0 thus u u 5 existence we turn our attention now to showing that the formal solution given by 53 and 54 is well defined and converges under proper assumptions on f and in particular we will demonstrate the following result theorem the formal solution given by 53 54 to the problem given by 1 4 is well defined provided that 1 ftt is continuous and f x y 0 0 2 fyyyxx is bounded and for all x y t f x 0 t f x 1 t fyy x 0 t fyy x 1 t

conditions they satisfy to change similarly for the sake of simplicity we leave them in this single case note also that five times continuous differentiability on and implies the conditions demanded here section 3 demonstrates that 53 54 is a solution to 1 4 if the differential operator cd 0 t 1 x x 2 x 2 2 y 2 can be applied term by term to show this it suffices to show that the series representing u x y t converges uniformly on 0 t and that the formal series given by uxx 1 xux uyy and utt all converge uniformly on t for all 0 the remainder of this section will be devoted to demonstrating this by applications of the weierstrass m test we begin by giving a handful of useful simple facts that will be used throughout the bounding procedure lemma 2 if f d c is a continuous function with fourier bessel series m n n fm n t j 0 mx sin n y then fm n t f 13 a boundary value problem for the 3 d fractional wave equation with singularity 14 for all m n and t proof with f and fm n as given f is well defined and finite by the compactness of d and continuity of f now for any t fm n t 2 m n n fm n t 2 and by parseval 1 0 1 0 x f x y t 2 dxdy 1 0 1 0 f 2 dxdy f 2 hence fm n t f lemma 3 if f 0 1 c and f l 1 0 1 then 1 1 0 f x cos n x dx 1 n 1 0 f x sin n x dx 2 and if f 0 f 1 0 then 1 0 f x sin n x dx 1 n 1 0 f x cos n x dx note here that if f being continuously differentiable or having a bounded derivative is enough to satisfy the requirement that f l 1 0 1 proof this is a simple application of integration by parts the analogous bounding feature for j 0 x is contained in 20 ch 8 section 19 and we state without proof lemma 4 if f 0 1 c is 2 k differentiable for k n f 0 f 0 f 1 f 2 k 2 0 f 2 k 2 1 f 2 k 1 0 0 and f 2 k is bounded then there is a constant c 0 such that for all m 1 0 xf x j 0 mx dx cm m 2 k 1 2 where m max f 2 k x and m is the m th positive 0 of j 0 x we next give some useful facts about fm n and its derivatives note that from the representation of fm n in 50 f m n t d dt 1 j 0 mx sin n y 22 1 0 1 0 xf x y t j 0 mx sin n y dxdy 1 j 0 mx sin n y 22 1 0 1 0 xft x y t j 0 mx sin n y dxdy which is the m n th fourier coefficient of ft x y t with respect to the family j 0 mx sin n y similarly f m n is the m n th fourier coefficient of ftt x y t the representations of fm n f m n and f m n as integrals of f ft and ftt against xj 0 mx sin n y demonstrate that the assumption ftt x y t is continuous implies that all fm n f m n and f m n are continuous our final step before directly handling the series at hand is to place a bound on cm n and dm n recall from 45 that cm n 1 j 0 mx sin n y 22 1 0 1 0 xj 0 mx sin n y x y dxdy where j 0 mx sin n y 22 1 0 1 0 x j 0 mx sin n y 2 dxdy 1 0 sin n y 2 1 0 xj 20 mx dx dy 55 14 a boundary value problem for the 3 d fractional wave equation with singularity 15 we bound 55 below this argument will take two steps to bound the component involving j 0 note that as a consequence of 20 eq 14 1 there is a c 1 0 such that c 1 m 1 0 xj 20 mx dx for all m n next we use the fact from 20 ch 8 section 10 that c 2 inf n n n 1 n is a nonzero positive number and hence that c 2 1 m 1 m for all m n thus taking c 3 to be c 1 c 2 1 for any m n c 3 m 1 0 xj 20 mx dx 56 this completes our bounding of the x component of 55 to handle the y component note that c 4 1 0 sin y 2 dy is evidently a positive real number hence 1 0 sin n y 2 dy 1 n 0 sin n y 2 dy and putting t ny 57 1 0 1 n sin t 2 dt 58 c 4 n 59 combining 55 56 and 59 demonstrates cm n cnm 1 0 1 0 xj 0 mx sin n y x y dxdy 60 where each c is a positive constant independent of m and n an identical argument can be applied to dm n and fm n to create similar bounds we now prove the uniform convergence of 53 54 since sin n y and j 0 mx are both strictly bounded by constants we can place the immediate bound tm n t j 0 mx sin n y c 5 tm n t 61 on the modulus of the terms of 53 54 furthermore since e 1 m nt and e 2 m nt are real for real t decrease as t increases and e 1 0 e 2 0 1 we see that for all m n and t r e 1 m nt 1 and te 2 m nt t t and since t is a fixed constant we see from 61 that tm n t c 6 cm n dm n t 0 t 1 e m n t fm n d 62 c 6 cm n dm n t 0 t 1 e m n t fm n d 63 15 a boundary value problem for the 3 d fractional wave equation with singularity 16 where c 6 is a positive constant we begin by bounding the contributions of cm n and dm n to 63 using the assumptions that yyy is continuous and x 0 x 1 yy x 0 yy x 1 0 we can apply lemma 3 three times with respect to y to 60 and obtain cm n c 7 m n 2 3 1 0 cos n y 1 0 x yyy x y j 0 mx dx dy 64 now since yyy is boundedly twice differentiable with respect to x and yyy 0 y yyy 1 y yyyx 0 y x yyy satisfies the same assumptions hence 1 0 x yyy x y j 0 mx dx 1 0 x x yyy x y j 0 mx dx c 8 m 5 2 max x y 0 1 x yyyxx x y c 9 m 5 2 65 by lemma 4 combining 65 and 64 now gives that cm n c 10 n 2 m 3 2 1 0 cos n y dy c 11 n 2 m 3 2 and since m n n 1 n 2 m 3 2 converges by the p test m n n cm n is dominated by an absolutely convergent numerical series and hence is uniformly convergent by the weierstrass m test the proof of the uniform convergence of m n n dm n is identical and uses the same assumptions on we now handle the contribution of the integral part to 63 which is given by m n n t 0 t 1 e m n t fm n d 66 after using 8 to integrate by parts we rewrite each term of 66 as t 0 1 m n e 1 m n t f m n d fm n t m n t 0 1 m n e 1 m n t f m n d fm n t m n 67 we handle each term in 67 for the second bessel s inequality ab a 2 b 2 demonstrates that fm n t m n 1 2 m n fm n t 2 68 using the parseval s identity and the fact that m n mn now shows that n m n 1 2 m n fm n t 2 f 22 m n n 1 mn 2 69 completing the argument for the second term for the first term lemma 2 and the assumption that ft x y t is continuous allows us to bound f m n by a constant independent of m and n thus for any 0 t 0 1 m n e 1 m n t f m n d c 12 m n t 0 e 1 m n t d c 12 m n t 0 1 1 m n t d t t 1 d by 10 c 12 m n t m n if we take 1 3 m n then this shows t 0 1 m n e 1 m n t f m n d c 12 m n t m n 1 3 m n 1 3 70 16 a boundary value problem for the 3 d fractional wave equation with singularity 17 as 1 2 and m n 1 we see m n 1 3 is bounded above by m n 1 3 thus 70 shows that t 0 1 m n e 1 m n t f m n d c 13 m n 4 3 since 4 3 1 the p series test demonstrates that m n n 1 m n 4 3 m n n 1 mn 4 3 71 hence combining 69 and 71 we see that 67 is dominated by an absolutely convergent series thus is uniformly convergent we have now shown that series given by 53 is uniformly convergent we next handle the uniform convergence of utt on t for a fixed 0 first we compute utt x y t using 8 and 9 d 2 dt 2 e 1 m nt m n d dt t 1 e m nt m nt 2 e 1 m nt and d 2 dt 2 te 2 m nt d dt e 1 m nt 1 m nt 1 e m nt lastly following the computation done from 23 27 and using the assumption that f 0 0 we see that d 2 dt 2 t 0 t 1 e m n t fm n d t 2 e 1 m nt fm n 0 t 0 t z 2 e 1 m nz fm n t z dz t 0 z 2 e 1 m nz f m n t z dz we have now shown that utt x y t m n n t m n t j 0 mx sin n y t m n t m ncm nt 2 e 1 m nt m ndm nt 1 e m nt t 0 z 2 e 1 m nz f t z dz our concern is now to bound each term t m n t j 0 mx sin n y above since j 0 mx sin n y is uniformly bounded by a constant we immediately have that t m n t j 0 mx sin n y c 14 m ncm nt 2 e 1 m nt m ndm nt 1 e m nt t 0 z 2 e 1 m nz f t z dz we thus prove the uniform convergence of utt by bounding each of the following terms with absolutely convergent numerical series m ncm nt 2 e 1 m nt 72 m ndm nt 1 e m nt 73 t 0 z 2 e 1 m nz f t z dz 74 first consider 72 applying 10 and the facts that 1 2 and t on t m ncm nt 2 e 1 m nt m nt 2 cm n e 1 m nt c 15 cm n m n 2 1 m nt c 16 cm n m n 2 m n c 17 cm n 17 a boundary value problem for the 3 d fractional wave equation with singularity 18 where c 17 is a constant independent of m n due to our previous results this shows that 72 is bounded above by an absolutely convergent numerical series analogously m ndm nt 1 e m nt m nt 1 dm n e m nt c 15 dm n m nt 1 1 m nt c 16 dm n m nt 1 m nt c 16 dm n t 1 c 16 dm n 1 c 17 dm n which proves that 73 is also bounded above by an absolutely convergent numerical series finally we consider 74 integrating by parts with dv z 2 e 1 m nz and using 9 and 10 we see that t 0 z 2 e 1 m nz f m n t z dz 75 t 1 e m nt f m n 0 t 0 z 1 e m nz f m n t z dz c 18 f m n 0 m n t 0 z 1 e m nz f m n t z dz 76 the first term in 76 is satisfactorily bounded by the same argument used in 68 69 for the second term begin by noting that 12 shows z 1 e m nz 1 z m n m nz e m nz 1 m n z 1 e 0 m nz 77 after using lemma 2 to estimate fm n by a uniform constant the integral term of 76 then becomes bounded by 1 m n t 0 z 1 e 0 m nt dz 78 now since 1 0 is understood to be 0 z 1 e 0 m nz z 1 k 1 m nz k k k 1 m n kz k 1 k and since 1 this demonstrates that lim z 0 z 1 e 0 m nz 0 this demonstrates that z 1 e 0 m nz can be continuously extended to the entirety of 0 t furthermore since e 0 is diminishing as its argument decreases for all n m n and z 0 t z 1 e 0 m nz z 1 e 0 1 1 z which is finite by the compactness of 0 t thus for any 0 1 applying 10 shows t 0 z 1 e

equation with singularity 19 taking m n 1 4 now shows t 0 z 1 e m nt f m n t z dz c 22 m n 5 4 finishing the last portion of the bounding of 74 this completes the proof of the uniform convergence of utt we next show that the series uyy x y t is bounded above termwise by an absolutely convergent numerical series on t for an arbitrary 0 taking the derivative twice with respect to y shows that uyy x y t m n n n 2 cm ne 1 m nt dm nte 2 m nt t 0 t 1 e m n t fm n d j 0 mx sin n y by placing a constant estimate on j 0 mx sin n y we obtain that each term is bounded above by n 2 cm ne 1 m nt dm nte 2 m nt t 0 t 1 e m n t fm n d as before we bound this expression in three parts n 2 cm ne 1 m nt 79 n 2 dm nte 2 m nt 80 n 2 t 0 t 1 e m n t fm n d 81 for 79 note that since we only consider t t an application of 10 demonstrates n 2 cm ne 1 m nt n 2 c 23 m n c 24 cm n 82 as m n n 2 for all n for 80 an analogous argument shows that n 2 dm nte 2 m nt c 25 dm n 83 as we have previously sufficiently bounded cm n and dm n in the proof of the convergence of u this finishes everything for uyy except 81 for 81 notice that as in 77 t 1 e m n t 1 m n t 1 e 0 m n t this demonstrates that n 2 t 0 t 1 e m n t fm n d n 2 m n t 0 t 1 e 0 m n t fm n d fm n n 2 m n t 0 t 1 e 0 m n t d we have now arrived at exactly the integral that appears in 78 and hence can follow the same argument to have its value bounded by c 25 m n 1 4 leaving us with n 2 t 0 t 1 e m n t fm n d fm n n 2 m n 5 4 84 19 a boundary value problem for the 3 d fractional wave equation with singularity 20 we now apply the conditions we placed on f to eliminate the n 2 term throughout the following argument let t be given note that at the start of this section fm n was bounded by fm n c 26 mn 1 0 1 0 xf x y j 0 mx sin n y dxdy 85 since fyyy is assumed to exist and f x 0 t f x 1 t fyy x 0 t fyy x 1 t 0 applying lemma 3 three times yields that fm n c 26 m n 2 3 1 0 cos n y 1 0 xfyyy x y j 0 mx dx dy 86 now as fyyyxx exists is bounded and satisfies fyyy 0 y t fyyy 1 y t fyyyx 0 y t 0 the same holds of xfyyy hence by lemma 4 and discussion of the zeros of j 0 x 1 0 xfyyy x y j 0 mx dx 1 0 x x fyyy x y j 0 mx dx c 27 m 5 2 max xfyyyxx c 28 m 5 2 87 bringing together 86 and 87 thus demonstrates that fm n c 29 n 2 m 3 2 and since was arbitrary fm n has the same bound therefore n 2 t 0 t 1 e m n t fm n d c 29 m n 5 4 m 3 2 which is a sufficient bound to complete the bounding of 81 and thus the uniform convergence of uyy next we show the uniform convergence of the series that represents a term by term application of 1 x x to u for t on the interval t 1 x ux x y t m n n tm n t m 1 x j 1 mx sin n y note that 18 was used to compute the derivative of j 0 mx here using property 16 of the bessel function we rewrite the sum as m n n tm n t m 2 j 0 mx j 2 mx sin n y once we estimate away j 0 mx j 2 mx and sin n x with a uniform constant the terms that we must bound above in order to apply the weierstrass m test are m 2 cm ne 1 m nt 88 m 2 dm nte 2 m nt m 89 m 2 t 0 t 1 e m n t fm n d 90 for 88 and 89 an analogous argument to as in 82 83 demonstrates that m 2 cm ne 1 m nt c 30 cm n m 2 dm nte 2 m nt m c 31 dm n now since cm n and dm n have been bounded above by terms in absolutely convergent series in the proof of u s convergence this fulfills our obligation for 88 and 89 20 a boundary value problem for the 3 d fractional wave equation with singularity 21 last we must bound 90 as the integral is the same as in 81 we are able to obtain the bound m 2 t 0 t 1 e m n t fm n d fm n m 2 m n 5 4 c 32 fm n m m n 5 4 91 we now leverage our assumptions on f to cancel the m term in 91 the process is similar to as in 84 for any since f x 0 t f x 1 t fy 0 y t fy 1 y t fyx 0 y t 0 and fyxx is bounded applying lemmas 3 then 4 to 85 shows fm n c 33 m 3 2 and hence that fm n has the same bound thus m 2 t 0 t 1 e m n t fm n d c 34 1 m n 5 4 m 1 2 which is a strong enough bound to guarantee the uniform convergence of 1 x ux to finish the existence portion we show the uniform convergence of uxx x y t on t first we compute j 0 mx xx by applying 18 and then 15 we see that 2 x 2 j 0 mx x mj 1 mx 2 m 2 j 0 mx j 2 mx this now shows that uxx x y t m n n 2 m 2 tm n t j 2 mx j 0 mx sin n y we again estimate j 0 mx j 2 mx and sin n x with a uniform constant to obtain that we must bound 2 m 2 cm ne 1 m nt 92 2 m 2 dm nte 2 m nt m 93 2 m 2 t 0 t 1 e m n t fm n d 94 with absolutely convergent series once more 92 and 93 are handled by an analogous argument to as in 82 83 which demonstrates that 2 m 2 cm ne 1 m nt c 35 cm n 2 m 2 dm nte 2 m nt m c 36 dm n now since cm n and dm n have been bounded above by terms in absolutely convergent series in the proof of u s convergence this fulfills our obligation for 88 and 89 finally we must place a bound on 94 the integral in the term is the same as in 81 hence we are able to obtain the bound 2 m 2 t 0 t 1 e m n t fm n d fm n 2 m 2 m n 5 4 c 37 fm n m 2 m n 5 4 we will now apply the remaining unused hypotheses on f to cancel the m 2 term our method is similar to as in 84 if t is given since f x 0 t f x 1 t fy 0 y t fy 1 y t fyx 0 y t fyxx 0 y t fyxx 1 y t fyxxx 0 y t 0 21 a boundary value problem for the 3 d fractional wave equation with singularity 22 and fyxxxx is bounded applying lemmas 3 then 4 twice to 85 shows fm n c 33 m 7 2 and hence that fm n has the same bound thus 2 m 2 t 0 t 1 e m n t fm n d c 34 1 m n 5 4 m 3 2 which bounds 94 above with an absolutely convergent numerical series this completes the convergence of uxx and the section on existence 6 stability we now demonstrate that our solution depends continuously on the choice of initial conditions to do this it suffices to show an estimation of u x y t in terms of and f with no additive constants this is due to the linearity of the homogeneous and nonhomogeneous problems if u solves 1 4 with and f given and u solves 1 4 with and f given then u u is given by the solution to 1 4 with and f f given our approach is largely similar to the methods used in existence since any solution to the original problem 1 4 is given by the sum of solutions to the homogeneous problem 34 37 and nonhomogeneous problem 38 41 we show bounds on each solution individually the solution to the homogeneous problem 34 37 is given by u x y t m n n cm ne 1 t dm nte 2 t j 0 mx sin n y where cmn and dmn are as in 45 and 47 using parseval s identity on the x and y components shows that u t 22 m n n cm ne 1 m nt dm nte 2 m nt 2 m n n cm ne 1 m nt 2 2 cm ne 1 m nt dm nte 2 m nt dm nte 2 m nt 2 m n n 2 cm ne 1 m nt 2 dm nte 2 m nt 2 where the last step is an application of bessel s inequality now since e 2 m nt 1 1 m nt 1 1 t and t 0 we see that e 2 m nt 2 1 1 t 2 1 1 t 2 hence dm nte 2 m nt 2 dm n 2 t 2 1 t 2 in the case that 0 t 1 certainly t 2 1 and therefore dm nte 2 m nt 2 dm n 2 similarly when t 1 then t 2 t 2 and we again obtain the above estimate since the e 1 term can be bounded above by 1 combining our estimates yields u t 22 2 m n n cm n 2 m n n dm n 2 2 22 22 hence u t 2 2 22 22 22 a boundary value problem for the 3 d fractional wave equation with singularity 23 completing the homogeneous case for the nonhomogeneous case we have u x y t m n n t 0 t 1 e m n t fm n d j 0 mx sin n x estimating the x and y portions of u by constants then gives u x y t m n n t 0 t 1 e m n t fm n d now for any m and n we can apply the identity 10 and then lemma 2 to obtain t 0 t 1 e m n t fm n d 1 m n t 0 t 1 e 0 m n t fm n d 95 f m n t 0 t 1 e 0 m n t d 96 we are now in precisely the situation of 78 and following the same argument shows that for any 0 1 t 0 t 1 e 0 m n t d c 1 t m n 1 c 2 here the factor of t demonstrates that the estimate that we obtain on u will be dependent on the geometry of the domain to obtain an estimate that depends minimally on the domain we minimize this factor by taking t m n 1 4 where t max t 1 then t 0 t 1 e 0 m n t d c 1 t m n 3 4 m n t 3 4 c 2 t 1 4 m n 1 4 c 3 t 1 4 m n 1 4 which combined with 96 shows that u x y t c 3 f t 1 4 m n n 1 m n 5 4 and hence that u c 4 f t 1 4 completing the non homogeneous case acknowledgement authors are
