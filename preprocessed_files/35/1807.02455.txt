potentials so that near them the focusing non linear schro dinger equation does not admit local birkhoff coordinates the proof is based on the construction of a local normal form of the linearization of the equation at such potentials 1 introduction it is well known that the non linear schro dinger nls equation 1 i 1 xx 2 i 21 2 2 i 2 xx 2 i 1 22 1 on the torus t r z is a hamiltonian pde on the scale of sobolev spaces hsc hsc hsc s 0 with poisson bracket f g i 1 0 1 f 2 g 1 g 2 f dx 2 and hamiltonian h h 1 c c given by h 1 0 1 x 2 x 2 1 2 2 dx 1 2 h 1 c 3 here for any s 0 hs c hs t c denotes the sobolev space of complex valued functions on t and the poisson bracket 2 is defined for functionals f and g on hsc provided that the pairing given by the integral in 2 is well defined cf section 2 for more details on these matters the nls phase space hsc is a direct sum of two reals subspaces h s c hsr r ihsr where hsr hsc 2 1 and ihsr hsc 2 1 the hamiltonian vector field corresponding to 2 and 9 xh i 2 h 1 h i 1 xx 2 i 21 2 i 2 xx 2 i 1 22 t k is partially supported by the swiss nsf p t is partially supported by the simons foundation award 526907 1 http arxiv org abs 1807 02455 v 2 is tangent to the real subspaces hsr and ih s r cf section 2 and for any s 0 the restrictions xh h 2 r h 2 r l 2 r and xh ih 2 r ih 2 r il 2 r are real analytic maps cf section 2 the vector field xh h 2 r corresponds to the defocusing nls dnls equation iut uxx 2 u 2 u whereas xh ih 2 r corresponds to the focusing nls fnls equation iut uxx 2 u 2 u both equations are known to be well posed on the sobolev space hsr and respectively ih s r for any s 0 moreover they are integrable pdes the dnls equation can be brought into birkhoff normal form on the entire phase space l 2 r cf 2 whereas for the fnls equation an arnold liouville type theorem has been established in 3 the aim of this paper is to study the local properties of the vector field xh in small neighborhoods of the constant potentials c x c c il 2 r c r c c 0 more specifically for a given c c c 6 0 consider the re normalized nls hamiltonian hc h 2 c 2 h 1 where h 1 1 0 1 x 2 x dx one of our main results is the following instance of an infinite dimensional version of williamson classification theorem in finite dimensions 6 theorem 1 1 assume that c c and c z then there exists a darboux basis k k k z in il 2 r such that the hessian d 2 c hc when viewed as a quadratic form represented in this basis takes the form d 2 ch c 4 c 2 dp 20 0 k c 4 k c 2 2 k 2 dpkdqk dp kdq k k c 4 k 2 k 2 c 2 dp 2 k dq 2 k 4 where dpk dqk k z are the dual coordinates we conjecture in section 3 that theorem 1 1 can be generalized to a small neighborhood of the constant potential c we refer to the end of section 3 where the precise statement of such a generalization is given an analog of theorem 1 1 formulated in terms of the linearization of the hamiltonian vector field xhc at the constant potential c is formulated in section 3 see theorem 3 2 as a consequence of these results we obtain 2 theorem 1 2 for any given c c with c z and c the focusing nls equation does not allow gauge invariant local birkhoff coordinates in a neighborhood of the constant potential c we refer to section 4 for the precise definition of gauge invariant local birkhoff coordinates in more general terms theorem 1 2 means that there is no neighborhood of the constant potential c with c z and c where one can introduce action angle coordinates for the fnls equation so that the action variables commute with the hamiltonian h 1 note that a similar result could be obtained using the ba cklund transform and the existence of a homoclinic orbit in a neighborhood of the constant potential c cf 5 note however that such a neighborhood of c is not arbitrarily small since it contains the homoclinic solution of the fnls equation finally note that the same results hold for the potentials c k ce 2 ikx c e 2 ikx where k z and c c with c z and c the only difference is that the re normalized hamiltonian for these potentials is of the form hc k h h 1 h 2 where c are specifically chosen constants depending on the choice of c and k and h 2 i 1 0 1 x 2 x x dx this easily follows from the fact that for any given k z and for any s 0 the transformation k ih s r ihsr 1 2 7 1 e 2 ikx 2 e 2 ikx preserves the symplectic structure induced by 2 and transforms the hamiltonian h into a linear sum of the hamiltonians h h 1 and h 2 organization of the paper the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we introduce the basic notions related to the symplectic phase geometry of the nls equation that are needed in this paper theorem 1 1 and related results are proven in section 3 in section 4 we prove theorem 1 2 acknowledgment both authors would

1 the nls phase space it is well known that the non linear schro dinger equation is a hamil tonian system on the phase space l 2 c l 2 c l 2 c where l 2 c l 2 t c is the space of square summable complex valued functions on the torus t for any two elements f g l 2 c the hilbert scalar product on l 2 c is defined as f g l 2 1 0 f 1 g 1 f 2 g 2 dx where f f 1 f 2 g g 1 g 2 and g 1 and g 2 denote the complex conjugates of g 1 and g 2 respectively in addition to the scalar product we will also need the non degenerate pairing f g l 2 1 0 f 1 g 1 f 2 g 2 dx 5 3 the symplectic structure on l 2 c is f g i 1 0 det f 1 g 1 f 2 g 2 dx 6 note that f g is not the ka hler form of the hermitian scalar product l 2 in l 2 c consider also the scale of sobolev spaces hsc h s c hs c where hs c hs t c is the sobolev space of complex valued distributions on t and s r for any given s r the pairing 5 induces an isomorphism s hsc h sc where hsc denotes the space of continuous linear functionals on hsc in this way for any given s r the symplectic structure extends to a bounded bilinear map hs h s c the l 2 gradient f 1 f 2 f of a c 1 function f hs c at l 2 c is defined by f s d f h sc where d f hsc is the differential of f at l 2 c in particular the hamiltonian vector field xf corresponding to a c 1 smooth function f hsc c at hsc defined by the relation xf d f is then given by xf i 2 f 1 f 7 the vector field xf is a continuous map xf h s c h sc remark 2 1 since xf h s c h sc we see that strictly speaking xf is a weak vector field on h sc however for the sake of convenience in this paper we will call such maps vector fields on hsc remark 2 2 the poisson bracket of two c 1 smooth functions f g hsc c is then given by f g d f xg i 1 0 1 f 2 g 1 g 2 f dx 8 provided that the pairing given by the integral in 8 is well defined the hamiltonian h h 1 c c of the nls equation is h 1 0 1 x 2 x 2 1 2 2 dx 9 by 7 the corresponding hamiltonian vector field is xh i 2 h 1 h i 1 xx 2 21 2 2 xx 2 1 22 10 clearly xh h 2 c l 2 c is an analytic map the nls equation is then written as 1 i 1 xx 2 i 21 2 2 i 2 xx 2 i 1 22 11 the phase space l 2 c has two real subspaces l 2 r l 2 c 2 1 and il 2 r l 2 c 2 1 4 so that l 2 c l 2 2 r il 2 r for any s r one also defines in a similar way the real subspaces hsr and ihsr in h s c so that h s c h s r r ihsr it follows from 9 that the hamiltonian h is real valued when restricted to h 1 r and ih 1 r moreover one easily sees from 11 that the hamiltonian vector field xh is tangent to the real subspaces h 1 r and ih 1 r so that the restrictions xh h 2 r h 2 r l 2 r and xh ih 2 r ih 2 r il 2 r are well defined and hence real analytic maps the vector field xh h 2 r corresponds to the defocusing nls equation and the vector field xh ih 2 r corresponds to the focusing nls equation this is consistent with the fact that the restriction of the symplectic structure to l 2 r and il 2 r is real valued for the sake of convenience in what follows we drop the restriction symbols in xh ih 2 r and xh h 2 r and simply write xh instead 2 constant potentials for any given complex number c c c 6 0 consider the constant potential c x c c il 2 r ic r it follows from 10 that xh c 2 i c 2 c c 12 since this vector does not vanish we see that c is not a critical point of the nls hamiltonian 9 and hence d ch 6 0 in h 1 c 3 the re normalized hamiltonian in addition to the nls hamiltonian 9 consider the hamil tonian h 1 1 0 1 x 2 x dx 13 note that this is the first hamiltonian appearing in the nls hierarchy see e g 2 the corresponding hamiltonian vector field is xh 1 i 1 2 14 for any s r we have that xh 1 hsc hsc and hence xh 1 is a regular vector field on hsc this vector field is tangent to the real submanifolds h s r and ih s r and induces the following one parameter group of diffeomorphisms of ihsr st ihsr ihsr 01 0 2 st 7 01 e it 02 e it 1 15 the transformations 15 preserves the vector field xh i e for any t r and for any ih 2 r st xh xh s t 16 it follows from 12 and 14 that xh c 2 c 2 xh 1 c 17 we have the following 1 in what follows we will restrict our attention to the real space ihs r s r 5 lemma 2 1 let c c 0 then one has i the re normalized hamiltonian hc ih 1 r r hc h 2 c 2 h 1 ih 1 r 18 has a critical point at c ii the curve c r ih 1 r c t 7 ce 2 i c 2 t ce 2 i c 2 t t r 19 is a solution of the nls equation 11 with initial data at c this is a time periodic solution with period c 2 iii the range of the curve c consists of critical points of the hamiltonian hc proof of lemma 2 1 item i follows directly from 17 since the symmetry 15 preserves both xh and xh 1 we conclude from 17 that for any t r xh st c 2 c 2 xh 1 st c 20 this together with the fact that st c is the integral curve of xh 1 with initial data at c we conclude that t s 2 c 2 t c is an integral curve of xh with initial data at c this proves item ii item iii follows from 20 3 the linearization of xhc at c and its normal form in this section we find the spectrum and the normal form of the linearized hamiltonian vector field xhc ih 2 r il 2 r at c ih 2 r in view of lemma 2 1 the constant potential c is a singular point of the vector field xhc i e xhc c 0 moreover by lemma 2 1 iii the range of the periodic trajectory c consists of singular points of xhc it follows from 10 and 14 that for any ih 2 r xhc i 1 xx 2 21 2 2 c 2 1 2 xx 2 1 22 2 c 2 2 hence the linearized vector field dxhc c ih 2 r il 2 r is given by dxhc c 1 2 i 1 xx 2 c 2 1 2 c 2 2 2 xx 2 c 2 1 2 c 2 2 21 where 1 2 ih 2 r since the symmetry 15 preserves xhc and since for any t r st c ceit ce it the map st conjugates the operator 21 computed at c with the one computed at ct with ct ce it more specifically one has the following commutative diagram ih 2 r il 2 r ih 2 r il 2 r lct s t lc s t 22 6 where for simplicity of notation we denote lc dxhc c by choosing t arg c in the diagram above we obtain lemma 3 1 the operators lc and l c are conjugate with this in mind in what follows we will assume without loss of generality that c is real in this case lc i 1 0 0 1 2 x 2 ic 2 1 1 1 1 c r 23 for any k z consider the vectors k 1 0 e 2 ikx and k 0 1 e 2 ikx 24 the system of vectors k k k z give an orthonormal basis in the complex hilbert space l 2 c so that for any 1 2 l 2 c k z zk k wk k where zk 1 k and wk 2 k denote 2 c 2 c 2 c where 2 c 2 z c is the space of square summable sequences of complex numbers in this way zk wk k z 2 c are coordinates in l 2 c in these coordinates the real subspace il 2 r is characterized by the condition that k z wk z k and the real subspace l 2 r is characterized by the condition that k z wk z k we denote the corresponding spaces of sequences respectively by i 2 r and 2 r it follows from 6 that for any k l z one has k l k l 0 and k l i kl where kl is the kronecker delta in addition to the vectors in 24 consider for k z the vectors k 1 2 k k 1 2 e 2 kix e 2 kix k i 2 k k i 2 e 2 kix e 2 kix 25 note that the system of vectors k k k z form an orthonormal basis in the real subspace il 2 r in addition this is a darboux basis in il 2 r with respect to the restriction of the symplectic structure 6 to il 2 r i e for any k l z one has k l k l 0 and k l kl moreover for any l 2 c k z xk k yk k 7 where xk yk k z are coordinates in l 2 c so that the real subspace il 2 r is characterized by the condition that xk yk k z 2 z r 2 z r for any k z xk 1 2 zk w k and yk 1 i 2 zk w k finally consider the 2 complex dimensional subspaces in l 2 c v ck spanc k k k z 26 together with the 4 real dimensional symplectic subspaces in il 2 r wrk spanr k k k k k z 1 27 and wr 0 spanr 0 0 28 it follows from 25 that for any k z 1 wrk c v ck c v c k and wr 0 c v c 0 29 since k k k z is an orthonormal basis of il 2 r il 2 r k z 0 wrk is a decomposition of il 2 r into l 2 orthogonal real subspaces we have the following theorem 3 1 for any c r c z the operator lc dxhc c ih 2 r il 2 r has a compact resolvent in particular the spectrum of lc is discrete and has the following properties i the spectrum of lc consists of 0 0 and k 4 k c 2 2 k 2 0 k c 4 ik 2 k 2 c 2 k c 30 for any integer k z 0 the eigenvalue 0 has algebraic multiplicity two and geometric multiplicity one for any k z 0 the eigenvalue k has algebraic multiplicity two and geometric multiplicity two ii for any k z the complex linear space v ck see 26 is an invariant space of lc in l 2 c and lc v c k i 2 c 2 4 2 k 2 2 c 2 2 c 2 4 2 k 2 2 c 2 31 in the basis of v ck given by k and k if 0 k c the matrix 31 has two real eigenvalues 4 k c 2 2 k 2 and if c k it has two purely imaginary complex eigenvalues 4 i k 2 k 2 c 2 8 iii for any k z 1 the real symplectic space wrk see 27 is an invariant space of lc in il 2 r when written in the basis k k k k of the complexification of wrk the matrix representation of of the operator lc wr k consists of two diagonal square blocks of the form 31 the real symplectic space wr 0 is an invariant space of the operator lc in il 2 r and lc wr 0 2 i c 2 1 1 1 1 when written in the basis 0 0 of the complexification of wr 0 zero is a double eigenvalue of this matrix with geometric multiplicity one proof of theorem 3 1 the proof of this theorem follows directly from the matrix representation of lc when computed in the basis of v ck given by the vectors k and k theorem 3 1 implies that the linearized vector field dxhc c has the following normal form theorem 3 2 assume that c r and c z we have i the vectors 0 0 and 0 0 form a darboux basis of w r 0 il 2 r such that lc wr 0 4 c 2 0 0 1 0 32 ii for any k z 1 there exists a darboux basis k k k k in wrk il 2 r such that 2 for 0 k c lc wr k 4 k c 2 2 k 2 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 33 and for k c lc wr k 4 k 2 k 2 c 2 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 34 in addition one has the following uniform in k z with k c estimates k k o 1 k 2 k k o 1 k 2 k k o 1 k 2 k k o 1 k 2 35 where k k k z is the orthonormal darboux basis 25 in il 2 r recall that hs z r with s r denotes the hilbert space of sequences of real numbers ak k z so that k z k 2 s ak 2 where k 1 k 2 we will also need the banach space 1 s z r of sequences of real numbers ak k z so that k z k s ak 2 here k k k k 1 while all other skew symmetric products between these vectors vanish 9 remark 3 1 note that the asymptotics 35 imply see e g 4 section 22 5 that for any s r the system k k k z is a basis in ihsr in the sense that for any ihsr there exists a unique sequence pk qk k z in hs z r hs z r such that k z pk k qk k where the series converges in ihsr and the mapping ihsr hs z r hs z r 7 pk qk k z is an isomorphism note that k k k z is a darboux basis that is not an orthonormal basis in il 2 r proof of theorem 3 2 item i follows by a direct computation in the basis of wr 0 provided by the vectors 0 0 and 0 0 see 25 towards proving item ii we first consider the case when k c denote for simplicity l k lc v c k ak 4 2 k 2 2 c 2 b 2 c 2 and note that a 2 k b 2 16 2 k 2 2 k 2 c 2 0 then in view of 31 lk i ak b b ak and l k lk in the basis of v cm given by m m for m k denote by k the positive square root of the quantity 2 k a 2 k b 2 ak a 2 k b 2 it follows from theorem 3 1 ii and 31 that fk 1 k b ak a 2 k b 2 e 2 ikx 36 and f k 1 k b ak a 2 k b 2 e 2 ikx 37 are linearly independent eigenfunctions of the restriction of lc to the invariant space v ck cv c k wrk c with eigenvalue k i a 2 k b 2 4 ik 2 k 2 c 2 the eigenfunctions have been normalized in a way convenient for our purposes denote by the complex conjugation in l 2 c corresponding to the real subspace il 2 r l 2 c l 2 c 1 2 7 2 1 38 remark 3 2 one easily sees from 38 that il 2 r idil 2 r and l 2 r idl 2 r this implies that for any il 2 r i i 39 10 since the operator lc is real i e lc ih 2 r il 2 r and complex linear we conclude from 39 that if f h 2 c is an eigenfunction of lc with eigenvalue c then f is an eigenfunction of lc with eigenvalue moreover one easily checks that for any f g h 2 c lcf g f lcg 40 which is consistent with the fact that xhc is a hamiltonian vector field equation 40 implies that if f g h 2 c are eigenfunctions of lc with the same eigenvalue c 0 then they are isotropic i e f g 0 since l 2 c il 2 r r l 2 r we have that fk k i k and f k k i k 41 where by 39 k f k f k 2 and k f k f k 2 i are elements in il 2 r moreover in view of remark 3 2 gk fk 1 k ak a 2 k b 2 b e 2 ikx 42 and g k f k 1 k ak a 2 k b 2 b e 2 ikx 43 are linearly independent eigenfunctions of the restriction of lc to the invariant space v ck cv c k wrk c with eigenvalue k i a 2 k b 2 4 ik 2 k 2 c 2 it follows from 6 36 37 42 and 43 that fk gk f k g k 2 i and fk g k f k gk 0 44 while fk f k gk g k 0 in view of remark 3 2 hence k k 1 4 i fk fk fk fk 1 and similarly k k 1 whereas all other values of evaluated at pairs of vectors from the set k k k k vanish this shows that the vectors k k k k form a darboux basis the matrix representation 34 of lc in this basis then follows from 41 and the fact that fk and f k are eigenfunctions of lc with eigenvalue i a 2 k b 2 lc k i k i a 2 k b 2 k i k and lc k i k i a 2 k b 2 k i k the asymptotic relations in 35 follow from the explicit formulas for f k and g k above together with m fm gm 2 m fm gm 2 i with m k and ak 4 2 k 2 2 c 2 11 the case when 0 k c is treated in a similar way in fact take k z with 0 k c and denote by k the branch of the square root of 2 k b 2 a 2 k ak i b 2 a 2 k that lies in the fourth quadrant of the complex plane c it follows from theorem 3 1 ii and 31 that fk 1 k b ak i b 2 a 2 k e 2 ikx 45 and f k fk 1 k ak i b 2 a 2 k b e 2 ikx 46 are linearly independent eigenfunctions of the restriction of lc to the invariant space v ck cv c k wrk c with eigenvalue k b 2 a 2 k 4 k c 2 2 k 2 by arguing in the same way as above one sees that gk 1 k b ak i b 2 a 2 k e 2 ikx 47 and g k gk 1 k ak i b 2 a 2 k b e 2 ikx 48 are linearly independent eigenfunctions of the restriction of lc to the invariant space v ck cv c k wrk c with eigenvalue k b 2 a 2 k 4 k c 2 2 k 2 since l 2 c il 2 r r l 2 r we have that fk k i k and gk k i k 49 where k f k f k 2 and k f k f k 2 i are elements in il 2 r by 39 this implies that f k k i k and g k k i k 50 it follows from 6 45 46 47 and 48 that fk gk f k g k 0 and fk g k f k gk 2 51 12 while fk f k gk g k 0 in view of remark 3 2 this together with 49 and 50 implies that the vectors k k k k form a darboux basis in wrk the matrix represen tation 33 of lc in this basis then follows from 49 50 and the fact that fk and gk given by 45 and 47 are eigenfunctions of lc with real eigenvalues b 2 a 2 k lc k i k b 2 a 2 k k i k and lc k i k b 2 a 2 k k i k this completes the proof of theorem 3 2 remark 3 3 in fact the canonical form 32 33 and 34 of the restriction of the opera tor lc to the invariant symplectic space wrk with k 0 can be deduced from the description of the spectrum of lc obtained in theorem 3 1 i ii and the williamson classification of lin ear hamiltonian systems in r 2 n see 1 6 instead of doing this we choose to construct the normalizing darboux basis directly the reason is twofold first in this way we obtain explicit formulas for the normalizing basis and second we need the asymptotic relations 35 to conclude that the system of vectors 0 0 together with k k k k k z 1 form a darboux basis in il 2 r in the sense described in remark 3 1 in this way as a consequence of theorem 3 2 we obtain the following instance of an infinite dimensional version of the williamson classification of linear hamiltonian systems in r 2 n 6 theorem 3 3 assume that c r and c z then the hessian d 2 ch c when viewed as a quadratic form represented in the darboux basis k k k z in il 2 r given by theorem 3 2 takes the form d 2 ch c 4 c 2 dp 20 0 k c 4 k c 2 2 k 2 dpkdqk dp kdq k k c 4 k 2 k 2 c 2 dp 2 k dq 2 k 52 where dpk dqk k z are the dual coordinates in this basis for any 0 k c denote ik pkqk p kq k and i k pkq k p kqk 53 and for k c ik p 2 k q 2 k 2 whereas for k 0 i 0 p 2 0 2 note that the functions in 53 are the commuting integrals characterizing the focus focus singu larity in the symplectic space r 4 see e g 8 we conjecture that the following holds there exists an open neighborhood u of c in il 2 r an open neighborhood v of zero in 2 z r 2 z r and a canonical real analytic diffeomorphism u v such that for any s 0 u ihsr v h s z r hs z r 7 pk qk k z 13 and for any p q v h 1 z r h 1 z r hc 1 p q hc ik k z where hc 12 z r r is a real analytic map we will discuss this conjecture in future work 4 non existence of local birkhoff coordinates first we will discuss the notion of local birkhoff coordinates let hs hs z r and 2 2 z r definition 1 we say that the focusing nls equation has local birkhoff coordinates in a neigh borhood of ih 2 r if there exist an open connected neighborhood u of in il 2 r an open neighborhood v of p q h 2 h 2 in 2 2 and a canonical c 2 diffeomorphism u v such that for any 0 s 2 u ihsr v h s hs 7 pk qk k z is a c 2 diffeomorphism and for any k z the poisson bracket ik h where h h 1 and ik p 2 k q 2 k 2 vanishes on v h 1 h 1 the map u v being canonical means that 1 k z dpk dqk 54 where 1 v u is the inverse of u v and is symplectic form 6 on il 2 r assume that the focusing nls equation has local birkhoff coordinates in a neighborhood of ih 2 r then for any k z and 0 s 2 consider the action variable ik u ihsr r ik ik recall that st t r denotes the hamiltonian flow st ihsr ihsr 1 2 7 1 e it 2 e it generated by the hamiltonian h 1 1 0 1 x 2 x dx see 13 from the standard nls hierarchy see e g 2 definition 2 the local birkhoff coordinates are called gauge invariant if for any k z 0 s 2 and for any u ihsr and t r such that st u ihsr one has ik st ik remark 4 1 the gauge invariance of local birkhoff coordinates means that the hamiltonian h 1 belongs to the poisson algebra ai f c 1 u c f ik 0 k z generated by the local action variables ik k z note that for example h 1 belongs to the poisson algebra generated by the functionals c where il 2 r c is the discriminant trm x x 1 and m x is the fundamental 2 2 matrix solution of the zakharov shabat system see e g 2 14 the main result of this section is theorem 1 2 stated in the introduction which we recall for the convenience of the reader theorem 4 1 for any given c c with c z and c the focusing nls equation does not admit gauge invariant local birkhoff coordinates in a neighborhood of the constant potential c ic r consider the commutative diagram u ih 2 r il 2 r v h 2 h 2 2 2 xhc x hc 55 where xhc is the hamiltonian vector field of the re normalized hamiltonian hc d c and x hc is defined by the diagram by linearizing the maps in this diagram at c we obtain ih 2 r il 2 r h 2 h 2 2 2 lc l c 56 where lc is the linearization of xhc at the critical point c and l c is the linearization of x hc at the critical point p q c in particular we see that the unbounded linear operator lc on il 2 r with domain ih 2 r is conjugated to the operator l c on 2 2 with domain h 2 h 2 we have lemma 4 1 assume that for a given c c the focusing nls equation has gauge invariant local birkhoff coordinates in a neighborhood of the constant potential c then the spectrum of the operator l c is discrete and lies on the imaginary axis proof of lemma 4 1 let pk qk k z be the local birkhoff coordinates on v 2 2 and let hc hc 1 v h 1 h 1 r be the hamiltonian hc in these coordinates one easily concludes from 54 and 55 that in the open neighborhood v h 2 h 2 of the critical point z p q one has x hc xhc n z hc pn qn hc qn pn since by lemma 2 1 and 55 z is a critical point of x hc hc pn z hc qn z 0 57 for any n z in addition we obtain that the operator l c h 2 h 2 2 2 takes the form l c dz x hc n z qn l z 2 hc pn pl dpl 2 hc pn ql dql z 58 n z pn l z 2 hc

dhc xil pl hc ql ql hc pl 59 in the open neighborhood v h 2 h 2 of z by taking the partial derivatives pn and qn of the equality above at z for n z we obtain in view of 57 that for any n l z 2 hc pn

60 are trivial more generally by taking the partial derivatives pn and qn of 59 in v h 2 h 2 for n 6 l we see that for any l z and for any n 6 l we have 2 hc pn ql pl 2 hc pn pl ql 0 and 2 hc qn ql pl

xik preserves xhc that is for any t r and for any p q v h 2 h 2 such that stk p q v h 2 h 2 we have the following commutative diagram v h 2 h 2 2 2 v h 2 h 2 2 2 xhc s t k s t k xhc 64 16 remark 4 2 note that for any s r and for any k z we have that xik pk qk qk pk is a vector field in the proper sense i e non weak on hs hs and that stk hs hs hs hs is a bounded linear map in fact if we introduce complex variables zk pk iqk k z then stk z l zl l 6 k e itzk l k in particular we see from 64 that for any k z and for any t r near zero we have that dst k z xhc stk stk dz xhc for k b we have stk z z and hence for any t r near zero l c stk stk l c by taking the t derivative at t 0 we obtain that for any k b l c dz xik 0 where dz xik qk dpk pk dqk 65 formula 63 together with 65 and 60 then implies that l c n k a ank xin z dz ik n b bn qn dpn pn dqn 66 for some matrices ank n k a and bn n b with constant elements note that in view of the commutative diagram 56 and theorem 3 1 the unbounded operator l c on 2 2 with domain h 2 h 2 has a compact resolvent in particular it has discrete spectrum moreover by theorem 3 1 i zero belongs to the spectrum of l c and has geometric multiplicity one since in view of 66 the vectors xik z k a are eigenvectors of l c with eigenvalue zero we conclude that a consists of one element a n 0 and that bn 6 0 for any n z n 0 hence the spectrum of l c consists of ibn n z n 0 and zero which has algebraic multiplicity two and geometric multiplicity one this completes the proof of lemma 4 1 let x y be the coordinates in r 2 equipped with the canonical symplectic form dx dy and let i x 2 y 2 2 the proof of the following lemma is not complicated and thus omitted lemma 4 2 if f r 2 r is a c 1 map such that f i 0 in some open neighborhood of zero then d 0 0 f 0 now we are ready to prove theorem 4 1 proof of theorem 4 1 take c c such that c z and c and assume that there exist gauge invariant local birkhoff coordinates of the focusing nls equation in a neighborhood of the constant potential c in view of lemma 3 1 and theorem 3 1 i the spectrum of lc on il 2 r is discrete and contains non zero real eigenvalues on the other side by lemma 4 1 the spectrum of l c lies on the imaginary axis this shows that the two operators are not conjugated and hence contradicts the existence of local birkhoff coordinates 17 references 1 v arnold mathematical
