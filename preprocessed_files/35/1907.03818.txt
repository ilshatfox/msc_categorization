chicago il 60604 usa abstract the trojan y chromosome tyc strategy is a promising eradication method that attempts to manipulate the female to male ratio to promote the reduc tion of the population of an invasive species the manipulation stems from an introduction of sex reversed males called supermales into an ecosystem the offspring of the supermales is guaranteed to be male mathematical models have shown that the population can be driven to extinction with a continuous supply of supermales in this paper a new model of the tyc strategy is introduced and analyzed that includes two important modeling characteristics that are neglected in all previous models first the new model includes intraspecies competition for mates second a strong allee effect is included several conclusions about the strategy via optimal control are established these results have large scale implications for the biological control of invasive species keywords trojan y chromosome invasive species differential equations model optimal control allee effect 1 introduction the detrimental effects of aquatic invasive species is well documented 3 4 5 6 17 19 21 30 33 subsequently a tremendous amount of effort by habitat controllers is devoted to designing effective eradication strategies such as chemical treatment local harvesting dewatering ichthyocides or a preprint submitted to elsevier march 7 2022 ar x iv 1 90 7 03 81 8 v 1 q bi o p e 8 j ul 2 01 9 suitable combination 29 however these methods are known to negatively impact ecosystems which may be already stressed by the presence of an aquatic invasive species 29 the trojan y chromosome strategy tyc is a new eradication strategy which circumvents many of the known negative ecological impacts due to current practice 12 32 29 tyc strategy involves an introduction of a sex reversed male the off spring of the sex reversed male called a supermale with a wild type female is guaranteed to be male therefore subsequent gen erations become male dominant and this skews the sex ratio towards more males the goal is that through the gradual reduction in the female popu lation extinction of the population may occur see fig 1 the supermale is not a genetically modified organism gmo and the tyc process is re versible that is if the introduction of supermales is stopped then the su permale population will die out 27 the tyc strategy has seen tremendous experimental and theoretical interest 14 28 32 7 8 9 13 22 24 23 25 26 34 35 37 figure 1 the pedigree tree of the tyc model that demonstrates trojan y chromosome eradication strategy a

classical population model of the tyc strategy relates the popu lations of the wild type xx females f wild type xy males m and the 2 yy supermale s populations over time a mathematical model was first proposed by gutierrez teem and parshad in 12 32 f 1 2 lfm f 1 m 1 2 lfm lfs m 2 s s 3 where l 1 f m s k k is the carrying capacity is the birth rate is the death rate and is the constant introduction rate the parameters and populations are assumed to be nonnegative due to the nonlinearities it is not necessary to assume that 0 to obtain a persistent invasive population it was shown in 32 that there exists a such that for all 0 that f m 0 in infinite time in the current manuscript we seek to include two important and rele vant modeling features first the influx of supermales leads to competition between wild males and supermales for female mates second if the female population is below a given threshold then the population loses fitness and extinction should occur 10 15 this latter phenomena is called the allee effect these two modeling features are introduced in section 2 a stability analysis of the equilibrium solutions is also included in section 2 in section 3 we then investigate the influence that intraspecies competition and the allee effect have on the optimal introduction rate that minimizes an objec tive function based on the total wild population and introduced super males a stochastic model is introduced to examine the influence of noise on the birth and death rates have on the objective function s value at the optimal introduction rate 2 modified tyc model with strong allee effect in this paper we investigate and propose a new model of the tyc strat egy namely f 1 2 l f 1 1 m s fm f 4 m 1 2 l f 1 1 m s fm l f 1 2 m s fs m 5 s s 6 3 where l and are as before again the parameters and populations are assumed to be nonnegative and that 0 that is the birth supercedes the death rate intraspecies competition between wild male and supermale populations for female mates is modeled through the nonnegative saturation term 1 m s m m s 2 m s s m s the saturation terms provide the percentage of the total male population that is either wild type or supermale clearly the range of the saturations term is 0 1 notice for a fixed wild type population as s then 1 0 and 2 1 in this situation the birth of females approaches zero while male offspring only occurs from female and supermale progeny likewise for a fixed supermale population as m then 1 1 and 2 0 subsequently male progeny only occurs from wild type male and female mating therefore 1 and 2 attempt to model the difficulty of wild type female finding suitable mates from either wild type or supermale populations the term f 1 models a strong allee effect and represents a loss of fitness in the female population when below the allee threshold this effect is problem of undercrowding of a species and was first motivated by observations made by allee in 1927 1 2 20 since then numerous evidences of this effect have been established 15 31 notice that when f 1 0 then f 0 provided l 0 therefore the female population will decrease toward extinction subsequently a goal of the tyc strategy is to push via the introduction of supermales the female population below the allee threshold in the forthcoming analysis the equations are rescaled the populations are scaled by the carrying capacity while the t is scaled by the deathrate that is t t the rescaled equations are f rl f a 1 m m s fm f 7 m r lf m s f a 1 m 2 2 s 2 m 8 s s 9 where l 1 f m s r k 2 1 a k 1 and k 4 2 1 equilibria and stability analysis a clear requirement of a valid intervention strategy is that in the absence of the strategy the invasive population would persist while if the interven tion strategy was employed control ideally extinction of the invasive species would be established therefore an effective tyc strategy is one that pro vides an introduction rate and initial supermale population such that the wild population is driven to extinction while in the supermale free case the population would persist it is clear that in the modified model exhibits the equilibrium solution 0 0 which is deemed the extinction state once f a the introduction rate of supermales should be set zero causing s 0 subsequently we investigate the equilibrium solutions in the case where 0 a necessary requirement for a successful tyc strategy that there exists some time such that in the forthcoming equilibrium analysis we are interested in equilibrium solutions in the situation where 0 obviously when 0 then in equi librium s 0 therefore the intraspecies terms 1 m 0 1 and 2 m 0 0 in such case f rl f a 1 m 1 0 m rl f a 1 f 1 0 we seek to analyze the stability and presence of nontrivial equilibrium solutions noting that in equilibrium f a 1 6 0 then m f 1 rl f a 1 hence all equilibrium solutions fall on the line f m the nontrivial equilibrium solutions are roots to the third degree polynomial g f 2 f 3 2 a 1 f 2 af a r 10 by descartes rule of signs there always exists a one negative real root which is neglected since this is not realistic in addition there are either two or zero positive real roots if there are zero positive real roots then the only equilibrium solution is the extinction state and is globally attracting in such case the tyc strategy is not necessary therefore we assume there are two real roots f 1 and f 2 where 0 f 1 f 2 5 the jacobian of our system of equations is j 1 c 1 c 0 0 1 where 1 2 f f 1 f a r f 2 1 f a r c 1 2 f f 1 f a r f 2 1 f a r 1 2 f f 2 r a clearly 3 1 is an eigenvalue which indicates exponentially decay in the supermale population the remaining two eigenvalues are determined by the characteristic equation of the submatrix j 33 namely 1 2 tr j 33 tr j 33 2 4 det j 33 2 1 2 1 to investigate the sign of 2 we recall that fi is a root of eq 10 this fact is used to determine an expression for 2 as a function of fi 2 fi 3 2 fir 2 1 a f 2 i r notice that this function is a concave down quadratic with a maximum location located at f 1 2 1 a 0 define f is the positive root of the quadratic function 2 f then 2 0 if fi f and 2 0 if fi f notice that 2 1 3 r a since a 1 implies that r a 1 then 2 1 0 subsequently we have 0 f 1 notice that g 0 g 1 0 now g f 0 provided that q r a r 2 16 a 3 ar 4 a 3 r ar

reasonable to expect values less than 5 of the carrying capacity 10 20 in such case g f 0 then by the intermediate value theorem we have f 1 f f 2 subsequently f 1 f 1 0 and f 2 f 2 0 are a saddle and a sink respectively we call f 2 f 2 0 the sustained state an effective tyc strategy will push populations away from the sustained state and toward the basin of attraction ideally into of the extinction state 2 4 6 8 10 0 00 0 05 0 10 0 15 0 20 0 25 a r q r a 0 q r a 0 figure 2 plot of q r a indicating regions where q r a is greater than zero and less than zero 3 optimal control analysis 3 1 optimal control analysis the goal of this section is to investigate the mechanisms in our tyc system of equations that if controlled could lead to optimal levels of both densities we assume that the scaled introduction rate is not known a priori and enter the system as a time dependent control such that 0 t consider the objective function j 0 t 0 f m 1 2 2 dt 7 subject to the governing equations 7 9 and initial conditions optimal strategies are derived for the objective function where we minimize both female and male populations while also minimizing the introduction rate optimal controls are searched for within the set u 0 namely u 0 measurable 0 t 0 t t the goal is to seek an optimal t such that j 0 max t 0 f m 1 2 2 dt 11 we use the pontryagin s maximum principle to derive the necessary con ditions on the optimal control 16 the hamiltonian for j 0 is given by h 0 f m 1 2 2 1 f 2 m 3 s we use the hamiltonian to find a differential equation of the adjoint i i 1 2 3 namely 1 t 2 r m 2 2

with respect to control variable resulting in h 3 8 a compact way of writing the optimal control is t max 0 3 3 2 numerical simulations in this section we will numerically simulate the optimal control for the modified tyc model with strong allee effect the following unscaled pa rameters used for simulation are provided from a least squares approxima tion of population experiments of guppy fish in 18 namely 0 0057 0 0648 k 405 24 and time interval of 0 200 in scaled variables r 17 8125 a 06 0 t 12 96 in fig 3 the numerically determined optimal t is shown in conjunction with the scaled populations using the optimal control t this indicates that a graduate introduction of supermales is ideal notice that the maximum introduction rate is located near the inflection point of the female population at t 4 25 therefore the acceleration of the declining population can be used as an indicator as to when to begin rapidly reducing the introduction rate 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 t 0 0 2 0 4 0 6 st a

for the classical model was determined in 18 see fig 5 which is shown in fig 4 in scaled variables for convenience without modeling intraspecies competition and the allee effect yields a larger objective function value at the optimal introduction rate in particular the objective values for the classical and modified models are 501 9203 and 315 1675 respectively the reduced value of the objective function in the modified model is clear by inspection of the plots of the integrands of the corresponding objective functions given in fig 5 therefore the inclusion of intraspecies competition and the allee effect greatly influence the overall cost of the tyc strategy and indicate the strategy is less costly than previously considered in 18 in the case of the tyc model that includes intraspecies competition for mates and does not consider the allee effect obtains an objective value of 381 3074 which is still considerably lower than the classical model however this suggests that intraspecies competition for mates has a greater influence on the choice of than the allee effect 10 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 t 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 f m 2 2 classical modified figure 5 a plot of the integrands of the objective functions f m 1 2 2 for the classical red and modified blue models we notice that the area under the curve for the modified model is less than that of the classical case in fig 6 we examine the influence of increasing the value of the dimen sionless variable r as r increases we see that optimal control is maintains the same overall shape in particular the initial introduction remains the same however the initial drop in the introduction rate is less severe in the case of higher reproductive rates 3 3 stochastic model sensitivity analysis there are numerous environmental influences that may cause perturba tions to the birth and death rates of the invasive species here we assume that and fluctuate around average values 11 36 therefore the birth and death rates may be treated as random variables such that 7 w 11 0 0 5 1 1 5 2 2 5 3 3 5 4 4 5 5 t 0 0 5 1 1 5 c o n tr o l increasing r figure 6 a plot of the optimal controls for increasing r on

motions with intensities and respectively here we examine the influence of noise on the objective value in sim ulations with the optimal control given fig 5 the noise on the birth d and death d rates are taken from a normal distribution an euler maruyama method is employed to determine a numerical solution to the stochastic model in each simulation we determine the objective function value eq 11 and compare the percent difference between the objective function value determined in case of no noise the results for increasing 12 percent noise are shown in fig 7 a linear regression through the 95 confi dence interval is shown as a reference and the intervals are given in the table 1 notice that for large amount of noise in the death and birth rates that the objective function is no more than 8 away from the no noise situation the slopes of the upper and lower 95 confidence intervals are relatively small and subsequently means that the value of objective function is changed only slightly for perturbations in the birth and death rates this provides experimental evidence that the determined optimal introduction rate is fairly robust to noise the death and birth rates 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70

analysis and improvement of models of the tyc erad ication strategy are essential to understanding the efficacy of the strategy as a control this is especially important in light of recent field

create the regression lines in fig 7 of the tyc strategy is proposed that includes intraspecies competition be tween males and supermales for female mates and a strong allee effect in the female population it is shown that the dynamical system exhibits an extinction and recovery equilibrium solution for realistic parameter values of the carrying capacity and birth and death rates in such case the equilib rium solutions are shown to be asymptotically stable and hence the goal of an effective tyc strategy is to push the wild type populations toward the basin of attraction of the extinction state an optimal introduction rate of supermales is determined through opti mal control theory and was chosen to minimize an objective function that measures the total amount of wild population and introduced supermales the optimal introduction rate for the classical model was given in 18 here we compare the influence of including the intraspecies competition for mates and the allee effect on the optimal introduction rate it is determined that the optimal introduction rate yields a significantly smaller objective function value as compared to the classical model this suggests that it is impor tant to include intraspecies competition and the allee effect to appropriately determine the overall cost of the tyc eradication strategy in addition this indicates that the overall cost of the strategy is smaller than previously predicted 18 lastly a stochastic model is proposed to investigate the influ ence of noise in the birth and death rates on the objective function s value 14 these results show the sensitivity in the objective function s value in light of perturbations to the birth and death rates numerical results indicate that the optimal introduction rate is indeed robust to noise in the birth and death rate this indicates that the optimal introduction rate is not greatly influenced by noise in death and birth rates acknowledgements jl and rp would like to acknowledge
