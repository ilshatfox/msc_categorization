abstract we consider a non linear integro differential model describing z the position of the cell center on the real line presented in 1 we introduce a new scaling and we prove rigorously the asymptotics when goes to zero we show that this scaling characterizes the long time behavior of the solutions of our problem in the cinematic regime i e the velocity z tends to a limit the convergence results are first given when the elastic energy associated to linkages is convex and regular the second order derivative of is bounded in the absence of blood flow when is quadratic we compute the final position z to which we prove that z tends we then build a rigorous mathematical framework for being convex but only lipschitz we extend convergence results with respect to to the case when admits a finite number of jumps in the last part we show that in the constant force case see model 3 in 1 i e is the absolute value we solve explicitly the problem and recover the above asymptotic

they take their cues directly from the infectious organism from tissue macrophages and other elements of the immune system neutrophils get close to their destination through the blood system when receiving chemical signals they express adhesion molecules 2 responsible for their rolling slowing down and eventual sticking to vessel walls 3 see fig 1 followed by extravasation and crawling through tissue towards their final destination figure 1 a schematic view of the interactions between a neutrophil and the arterial wall in the blood flow illustration taken from 4 in this article we analyze a class of models for the process of rolling and slowing down along the vessel wall by transient elastic linkages the model has the nondimensionalized form z t r z t z t a a t da v t t 0 t z t zp t t 0 1 here z t r is the position of the cell at time t with the given past positions zp t t 0 the integro differential equation describes a force balance between the friction force f t v t z t with the blood flow velocity v t and the elastic linkage forces between the cell and the vessel wall described by the integral these forces are parametrized by the age a of the linkages and the density of linkages with respect to their age is given by a t 0 the function describes the potential energy of a linkage dependent on the distance z t z t a between the present position of the cell and its position when the linkage has been established see fig 2 the dimensionless parameter 0 results from scaling and represents the ratio between the typical age of a linkage and a characteristic time for the cell movement small values of correspond to a rapid turnover of linkages the occurrence of the factor 1 is a scaling assumption needed to obtain an effect of the linkages in the limit 0 however 1 can also be seen as a macroscopic rescaling of the model for the microscopic unknown z z note that in this interpretation we assume the data v and to vary in terms of the macroscopic time t models of the form 1 with various choices of have been derived in 1 passing from a probabilistic description to an averaged version the simplest example is a linear model with quadratic potential energy u u 2 2 this has already been formulated in 1960 s together with the formal macroscopic limit as a derivation of rubber friction 12 it has also been used in the context of the filament based lamellipodium model 5 13 for the crosslinking between cytoskeleton filaments and cell substrate adhesion there it is usually coupled with an age structured population model for the density its mathematical analysis has been developed in 6 7 8 9 10 11 2 z t a 1 z t z t a 2 z t a 3 f t a 1 f t figure 2 the position of the moving binding site at time t and time t a 1 with some of the respective linkages nonlinear models may contain the effects of material or of geometric nonlinearities an example for the latter is a model with linkages in the form of membrane tethers 4 connecting the anchoring point with the closest boundary point of a circular cell with microscopic radius r see fig 3 this gives a tether length u u 2 r 2 r and with linear material properties u u 2 2 o u 4 as u 0 concerning material nonlinearities we also allow models with nondifferentiable potentials such as constant force u u our main structural assumption is convexity of z t a z t r v t figure 3 the actual length of filaments of a cell of radius r is the dashed green segment whose length is z t z t a 2 r 2 r the formal macroscopic limit of 1 as 0 reads z 0 t r az 0 t a t da v t t 0 z 0 t zp t t 0 2 convexity of implies that the left hand side of the implicit ode is a strictly increasing function of z 0 t a rigorous justification of the macroscopic limit has been given in 6 for the linear problem without the additional friction force due to the blood flow generalizations of this result belong to the main goals of the present work strongly related is the long time asymptotics assuming the data a t v t to converge to a v as t we expect convergence of the velocity z t to a constant z satisfying z r az a da v 3 essentially the same equation as in 2 again we shall be interested in making this limit rigorous 3 another concern of this article motivated by the formal computations made in 1 is to give a rigorous mathematical meaning to 1 in the case when is only lipschitz as a consequence of convexity and to justify the asymptotic limits also in this situation the main results of this paper can be summarized as follows i for convex and additionally with lipschitz continuous derivative a comparison principle for a class of integro differential equations including 1 proved in section 2 is used in section 3 to obtain an a priori estimate allowing to show global existence of a unique solution of 1 the comparison principle is also used for an error estimate in the rigorous justification of the limit 0 under weak convergence assumptions on the data as t we prove z t z t o 1 for the solution z of 1 with 1 where z is the unique solution of 3 the asymptotic behaviour of the o 1 term remains open in general except for a simple linear model problem with z 0 where the limit of z t can be computed explicitly ii in section 4 the case of convex and therefore locally lipschitz without any further smoothness assumptions is treated except global lipschitz continuity in this situation a new notion of solution is needed we take inspiration from gradient flows for nonsmooth energy functionals 14 and rewrite the problem with a smoothed potential as a variational inequality where we can pass to the nonsmooth limit the limiting variational inequality v t z t w z t r z t z t a a t da r w z t a a t da w r 4 is then equivalent to the differential inclusion v t z t r z t z t a a t da where the right hand side is the subdifferential of the integral interpreted as a function of z t we prove global existence of a solution in this sense with w z t w the variational inequality is written in a form where we can pass to the limit 0 giving v z 0 t w r az 0 t a t da r az 0 t w a t da w r 5 the linearization approach of section 3 for the rigorous limit does not work in the nonsmooth case however convergence can be proved under the additional assumptions of time independent data v finitely many discontinuities of and a nonvanishing limiting velocity the proof relies on the fact that by the nonvanishing velocity the argument of is close to the discontinuities only for a small set of values of a we then extend this result to data v non constant in time but whose limit pair 0 v 0 is constant finally the convergence as t is transformed to the convergence as 0 by a rescaling allowing to apply the previous result this gives essentially that z t z t o t i e a weaker result than for smooth potentials where z is equal to the solution of v w r a a da r w a a da w r 6 4 iii in order to illustrate our results we consider in section 5 the case when u u and study solutions of 5 we show a plastic asymptotic behavior of the model if v where r a da then sgn v and z t when t is large if v the unique solution of 5 is 0 the neutrophil should stop in this latter case the previous asymptotic results do not prove that actually z vanishes for t growing large assuming that a t a a t a t with being a decreasing integrable function and a t a t the characteristic function of the set a t we show that z t z 0 t 0 v d if v 0 z 0 t 0 v d if v 0 where t t 0 t dt and denotes the positive negative part the same approach gives an explicit profile of z t in the case when v all these arguments provide rigorous mathematical justifications of numerical observations and formal computation in 1 section 3 3 2 2 notations generic hypotheses and a comparison principle we introduce some notation for the rest of this article for the final time t 0 we introduce it 0 t for t and it 0 for t for functional space we write lptlqa lp it lq r for any real p q 1 2 and similarly l a t l r it the weighted lp space of functions of a r with non negative weight a is denoted by lp a da 1 p we state the basic hypotheses that are common to results presented hereafter extra hypotheses will be assumed locally in the claims assumptions 2 1 for 0 t we assume that i the potential is even convex and 0 0 u u r ii the past data zp is bounded and lipschitz on r i e zp a 1 zp a 2 lp a 1 a 2 a 1 a 2 r 2 iii the source term satisfies v c 1 it iv the nonnegative kernel satisfies cb it l 1 1 a 2 da for later use we prove a comparison principle and a stability estimate for a class of integro differential equations including 1 lemma 2 1 let t 0 and let a t u be measurable with respect to a t and let it be odd and nondecreasing as a function of u let the operator h be defined by h z t z t 0 a t z t z t a da 0 t t acting on functions z whose values on 0 are prescribed then h satisfies the comparison principle h z t 0 for t 0 and z t 0 for t 0 z 0 any solution z c 0 t of the problem h z t f t t 0 z t zp t t 0 5 satisfies z t sup 0 zp t 0 f d 0 t t proof the comparison principle is as usual first shown for the case of strict inequalities thus we assume h z t 0 t 0 and z t 0 t 0 let t 0 0 denote the smallest zero of z then we arrive at the contradiction z t 0 0 a t 0 z t 0 a da 0 implying z 0 the statement with non strict inequalities is obtained in the standard way by an approximation argument for 0 let z z 1 t this implies h z t h z t 0 t 0 z t 0 t 0 giving z 1 t by the argument with strict inequalities and z 0 in the limit 0 finally we define z t sup 0 zp t 0 f d t 0 and z t sup t zp t 0 this implies h z z t f t sgn z t f t 0 sgn z t a t z t z t a a t z t z t a z t z t a da 0 sgn z t a t z t z t a a t z t z t a da where we have used the monotonicities of z and of for z t 0 we use the oddness of and write the integrand on the right hand side as a t z t z t a a t z t z t a 0 by the monontonicity of for z t 0 the integrand reads a t z t z t a a t z t z t a 0 showing h z z t 0 t 0 since obviously z t z t 0 for t 0 an application of the comparison principle completes the proof 3 the regular convex potential in this section the additional assumption c 1 1 r on the potential is used we start with existence results for 1 and for the formal limit 2 as 0 theorem 3 1 let assumptions 2 1 hold and let furthermore be lipschitz on r then there exists a unique solution z c 1 it of problem 1 6 proof local existence will be proven by picard iteration as for odes in the space c 0 with 0 small enough since this is completely standard we only prove the contraction property of the fixed point map f z t zp 0 t 0 v s ds t 0 0 a s z s z s a da ds let z 1 z 2 c 0 with z 1 t z 2 t zp t t 0 then we estimate f z 1 t f z 2 t 2 l sup s 0 t 0 a s da sup s 0 z 1 s z 2 s with the lipschitz constant l of showing that f is a contraction for small enough existence on 0 t follows from the a priori estimate z t sup 0 zp t 0 v s ds obtained by an application of lemma 2 1 with a t u a t u and f v continuous differ entiability of z follows from the continuity of v and with respect to t lemma 3 1 let the assumptions of theorem 3 1 hold then there exists a unique solution z 0 c 1 it of 2 proof this is an initial value problem for an implicit ode the monotonicity of and 0 0 imply existence and uniqueness of z 0 t as well as the stability estimate z 0 t v t by the lipschitz continuity of and by c it l 1 a da the left hand side of 2 is continuous as a function of z 0 t and t this and the stability estimate imply continuity of z 0 completing the proof now we are in the position to prove a convergence result theorem 3 2 let the assumptions of theorem 3 1 hold then lim 0 z z 0 uniformly in bounded subsets of it proof a straightforward computation shows that the difference between 1 and 2 can be written as a linearized problem for the error z z z 0 l z t r t t 0 z t 0 t 0 with l z t z t r k a t z t z t a da k a t a t 1 0 su a t 1 s u 0 a t ds and with r t 0 k a t a z 0 t z 0 t z 0 t a a da 7 7 since 0 lemma 2 1 with a t u k a t u can be applied to the linearized problem giving z t t 0 r d it remains to estimate 7 we start with z 0 t z 0 t z 0 t a a 1 a t t a z 0 t z 0 s ds 1 a t t a z 0 t z 0 s ds 1 a t t a z 0 s z 0 s ds in the first term on the right hand side we use the modulus of continuity t of z 0 on the interval 0 t in the second term the integrand is bounded by assumption 2 1 ii thus z 0 t z 0 t z 0 t a a t a z 0 0 lp 1 t a 0 since k l with the lipschitz constant l of already used above r t l 0 a a t t a da l z 0 0 lp t a a t da l 0 a a t t a da l z 0 0 lp 0 1 a a a t da t the result follows by integration with respect to t and by using the dominated convergence theorem for the first term on the right hand side the rest of this section is concerned with large time asymptotics for notational simplicity the pa rameter is set to 1 whence 1 reads z t r z t z t a a t da v t t 0 z t zp t t 0 8 first we prove that for large time the velocity becomes approximately constant for the time dependent data a weak convergence assumption is sufficient in the sense that the difference between the data and its asymptotic limit is integrable up to t theorem 3 3 let the assumptions of theorem 3 1 hold with t and let v r and l 1 1 a da satisfy 0 v t v dt 0 0 a a t a da dt then there exists a unique solution z r of 3 such that the solution z of 8 satisfies z t z t o 1 as t proof existence and uniqueness for 3 follows as in the proof of lemma 3 1 and we denote the solution by z a straightforward computation shows that z defined by z t z t z t zp 0 8 t 0 and z t 0 t 0 satisfies the linearized equation l z t r t t 0 with l z t z t 0 k a t z t z t a da k a t a t 1 0 su a t 1 s az ds r t v t v 0 az a t a da lemma 2 1 can be applied with 1 a t u k a t u and f r to show that for any t 0 z t z t zp 0 z t zp 0 0 r d zp 0 0 v v d l z 0 0 a a a da d completing the proof an improvement of this result i e convergence of z t and of z t z t can be achieved under additional assumptions in particular for vanishing flow velocity v proposition 3 1 let the assumptions of theorem 3 1 hold with t and let v 0 let satisfy 0 t a l l 1 r r and 0 0 t l r furthermore let there exist l 1 r 1 a such that t in l 1 r 1 a then the solution of 8 satisfies 0 z t 2 dt r a 0 zp 0 zp a da and limt z t 0 proof setting u a t z t z t a the function u a t solves the transport problem t a u u a t z u 0 t 0 and u a 0 ui a with ui a zp 0 zp a this connection between the delay equation and age structured popu lation models has already been used in 6 see also 17 considering a t u a t it solves in the sense of characteristics cf 6 theorem 2 1 and lemma 2 1 t a u t a u u a t z integrated in age this gives d dt r a t u a t da r u a t daz z 2 which then leads to r a t u a t da s t s 0 t 0 z 2 ds 0 this shows that z belongs to l 2 r since z 2 l 2 r r ui a 0 da 9 with the formula u a 0 t t t a 0 z d a 0 t the cauchy schwarz inequality implies u a 0 t a 0 z l 2 t a 0 t using lebesgue s theorem it is easy to show that limt z l 2 t a 0 t 0 thanks to lebesgue s theorem again one shows that t 0 a u a t da 0 when t grows large by hypothesis 0 0 so that t 0 u a t a da l r t 0 u a t a da which shows that the left hand side also tends to zero as t tends to infinity in order to study the convergence of r a t u a t da when t goes to infinity we split the integral in two parts r u a t da t 0 t u a t da i 1 i 2 for the first part one has i 1 t 0 u a t a da t 0 u a da the last term is already estimated above and tends to zero when t goes large for the first one as 0 0 one has t 0 u a t a da l u 1 a l 0 t 1 a t l 1 r the latter term vanishing when t grows by hypothesis it remains to consider i 2 by the definition of u we have u a t ui a t t 0 z d a t and thus u a t ui a t t z l 2 t which finally provides u a t 1 a ui 1 a l a z l 2 t by lebesgue s theorem this gives that i 2 tends to zero as t goes to infinity these arguments show that z vanishes at infinity since z t r a t u a t da 10 finally we are able to identify the limit of z t under the further assumptions that is time independent and nonincreasing and the problem is linear we assume that u u 2 2 and and a a 0 and set p a t t 0 u a d t 0 z z a d which solves t a p r a p a t da ui a a e a t r 2 p 0 t 0 p a 0 0 9 if p reaches a steady state p it should satisfy ap a r a p a da ui a p 0 0 with the explicit solution p a a 0 ui a da a 0 a a 0 ui a da da 1 0 a a da 1 then setting p a t p a t p a it solves the homogeneous problem associated with 9 with

proposition 3 1 the simple computation z t zp 0 r a p a da r a p a t da completes the proof of the following result proposition 3 2 let the assumptions of proposition 3 1 hold let be independent of t

2 11 4 discontinuous stretching force differential inclusions in this section we allow the elastic response function to be discontinuous however different from the preceding section we assume its boundedness note that in terms of the potential this means that the convexity assumption which implies local lipschitz continuity is strengthened to global lipschitz continuity we start by smoothing to be able to apply results from the preceding section lemma 4 1 let assumptions 2 1 hold and furthermore c 0 1 r with lipschitz constant l let 1 denote a smooth even probability density and 1 1 then for 0 0 is smooth even convex and lipschitz continuous with lipschitz constant l furthermore is lipschitz continuous on r and lim 0 uniformly on bounded subsets of r proof since is convex we have u 1 v y u y 1 v y u y 1 v y integrating against y dy gives the convexity of the estimate u r u v v dv l r 1 d shows the lipschitz continuity of the remaining results are standard and can be found in basic textbooks cf appendix c theorem 6 in 14 appendix c theorem 6 lemma 4 2 let the assumptions of lemma 4 1 hold then problem 1 with replaced by has a unique solution z c 1 it which is for every compact i it bounded in c 1 i uniformly in and proof the data with replaced by satisfy the assumptions of theorem 3 1 implying the existence and uniqueness statement the obvious estimates z t v l it l 0 a da l it z t zp 0 t z l it complete the proof we shall deal with the lack of smoothness of the potential by passing to a variational formulation analogous to the treatment of gradient flows with nonsmooth convex potentials see e g 14 for t it z t r and w r we define i z t w r w z t a a t da which is for each 0 a smooth function of w with the notation from lemma 4 2 we have by the convexity and smoothness of that for each t it z t argmin w r i z t w w z t v t 12 or equivalently i z t w i z t z t v t z t w z t w r 10 the formal limit i z t w r w z t a a t da of i is still a convex but not necessarily a smooth function of w we define its set valued subdiffer ential by i z t w q r i z t w i z t w q w w w r for each w r it is a nonempty closed interval an existence result where 1 is replaced by a differential inclusion can now be proven by passing to the limit 0 in 10 theorem 4 1 let the assumptions of lemma 4 1 hold then there exists z c 0 1 loc it such that for almost every t it v t z t i z t z t 11 proof by lemma 4 2 and the arzela ascoli theorem there exists z c 0 1 loc it such that as 0 z converges up to the choice of an appropriate subsequence to z uniformly on bounded subintervals of it also z converges to z in l it weak star where the notation is justified since it is equal to the derivative of z almost everywhere in it by lemma 4 1 ii and iii the integrands in i z t w and i z t z t converge pointwise in a r by the uniform lipschitz continuities of and z the integrands can be bound by c 1 a l 1 r therefore we can pass to the limit in i z t w and i z t z t by dominated convergence the last term in 10 converges in l it weak star as a consequence of the strong convergence of z and of the weak star convergence of z therefore the limiting variational inequality i z t w i z t z t v t z t w z t w r holds for all lebesgue points t of z and this is equivalent to 11 the formal limit problem 5 is equivalent to 0 jt z 0 t with jt w w 2 2 v t w 0 aw a a t da which means that we are looking for a minimizer of jt since this a strictly convex coercive function a unique minimizer exists showing the existence of a unique solution of 5 in the following proof we shall need a result on the representation of subdifferentials 18 with the definition u a t z t z t a if t a z t zp t a otherwise u 0 a t az 0 t for a e a t r 0 t we define the function f w r u a t w a t da 13 as a consequence of being convex and lipschitz the subdifferentials of and f coincide with their generalized gradients as defined in 18 prop 2 2 7 this allows to use 18 theorem 2 7 2 implying f w r w u a t a t da as a consequence there exist measurable selections u a t u a t and u 0 a t u 0 a t such that z t r u a t a t da v t z 0 t r u 0 a t a t da v t theorem 4 2 assume that z solves the differential inclusion 4 with is constant in time and l 1 r 1 a 2 l r v is constant is convex l lipschitz and there exists a finite set u ui i 1 n such that u 1 u 2 un c 1 1 r u and there exists l such that w 1 w 2 l w 2 w 1 for all w 1 w 2 u 1 2 n 1 i 1 ui ui 1 2 un 2 then there exists a unique real r solving 5 moreover if 6 0 then z z 0 c 0 t c v l zp ln 12 where z 0 t t zp 0 proof we prove the result for n 1 the general proof for n 1 works the same first if solves 5 with a kernel a and a source term v both constant in time then is constant for the rest of the proof we set u 0 a t a and we assume that 6 0 then one defines a t a r s t u a t u 0 a t since for a fixed t the function of a u a t u 0 a t is continuous a t is a closed set it is also lebesgue measurable by hypothesis there exists u r such that c 1 1 r u and there exists a constant l such that u v l u v u v u 2 u 2 in this context we consider four cases depending on whether 0 resp 0 and u 0 resp u 0 i if 0 and u 0 we assume that u for every a a t one has u 0 a t a 0 u and u a t a which implies u a u a u a t 14 this means that for every a a t u 0 a t u a t u 2 both solutions lie in the domain where is lipschitz thus u a t u a t and u 0 a t u 0 a t and thus setting r t a t u a t u 0 a t a da one has that r t l l 1 a the symmetric case when 0 and u 0 works the same provided again that u ii if instead 0 and u 0 there exists a 0 0 such that u a 0 we split the previous integral in two parts r t a t b a 0 a t b a 0 u a t u 0 a t a da i 1 t i 2 t where is a small positive parameter yet to be fixed the first term can be bounded by the measure of b a 0 indeed i 1 t 2 l b a 0 a da c 13 the latter bound being possible since is also a bounded function next if a a t b a 0 we start by choosing a a 0 moreover we assume that 14 these two latter inequalities allow to write 0 a 0 a u 0 a 0 t u 0 a t u u 0 a t which implies obviously that u 0 a t u u since a a t u a t u 0 a t u 0 a 0 t u so that u a t u as well this implies that for a a t and a a 0 u a t u 0 a t u 2 if a a 0 and a a t then one shows in the same way that u a t u 0 a t u 2 the case when 0 and u 0 follows exactly the same lines and leads to the same conclusion when a a t b a 0 provided that 14 holds u a t u 0 a t u 2 u 2 thus u a t u a t and u 0 a t u 0 a t and again a a t b a 0 u a t u 0 a t l 15 which shows that i 2 t l l 1 a 15 so if for instance 2 combining 13 and 15 we have proved that r t c one shall remark firstly that can be made arbitrarily small and that the latter bound is uniform with respect to setting again z t z t z 0 t we shall write the difference equation solved by z tz r u a t u 0 a t a da 0 we rewrite the last integral term on the left hand side as r u a t u 0 a t a da r a t u a t u 0 a t u a t u 0 a t u a t u 0 a t a da a t u a t u 0 a t a da that becomes tz r a t u a t u 0 a t u a t u 0 a t u a t u 0 a t a da r and we denote k a t u a t u 0 a t u a t u 0 a t a r a t a 16 since the subdifferential of is monotone k is positive moreover it is a function in l 1 r 1 a 2 indeed 0 k a t 2 l a 17 our problem can thus be rephrased as tz r k a t u a t u 0 a t da r 18 that becomes tz r k a t u a t u 0 a t da r k a t u 0 a t u 0 a t da r where u 0 a t z 0 t z 0 t a a if t a z 0 t zp 0 t otherwise 16 thanks to this latter definition the first term in the right hand side above can be reduced to r k a t u 0 a t u 0 a t da 1 t t a k a t da then we rewrite 18 as t z t 1 t k a t a t z t a da r 19 where t is defined as t z t tz t 1 r k a t da z t 1 t 0 k a t z t a da the first term in the right hand side of 19 can be estimated thanks to 17 1 t k a t z t a da 4 l 1 lzp 1 a 2 l 1 a 1 t 20 at this step we have proved that t z t m t c 1 1 t an easy computation shows that t z t sgn z t t z t m t and since t 0 m s ds is non decreasing and non negative one has t t 0 m d m t leading to the inequality t z t t t 0 m d we are in the framework of 16 generalized gronwall lemma 3 10 p 298 and we write z t t 0 m d c ln t then setting ln one obtains the error estimates 12 which ends the proof theorem 4 3 let z solve the differential inclusion 4 with i the kernels and 0 are such that l 1 l r 0 t 17 0 l 1 r 1 a 2 l r is constant in time with tending to zero in l 1 r 0 t ii the source term v w 1 0 t and v 0 r such that v v 0 r in l 1 0 t iii satisfies hypotheses of theorem 4 2 the same conclusions as in theorem 4

arguments as above becomes tz r u a t u 0 a t k a t da r r u 0 da v t v 0 where k is defined in 16 since one obtains as above t z t m t c 1 1 t l r a t 0 a da v t v 0 the same comparison principle as in theorem 4 2 then provides the claim integrating m in time remark 4 1 if is only lipschitz and convex then its derivative has at most a countable set of points in r where it is discontinuous hypotheses above on assume a finite number of isolated jumps of on the real line to our knowledge it is not possible to extend the previous proof to this general case nevertheless for practical applications cf for instance examples in 1 and section 5 it seems sufficient here we present a new way to recover large time asymptotics thanks to the scaling above theorem 4 4 under assumptions 2 1 and assuming that 1 v r and v w 1 r is such that r v t v dt 2 l 1 r 1 a such that r r a t a dadt 3 if satisfies assumptions of theorem 4 2 then if z solves v t z t w z t r z t z t a a t da r w z t a a t da w r 21 18 when t goes to infinity there exists z 0 t t such that lim t z t t z 0 1 0 22 where solves 6 proof we consider the solution z of the problem 1 on the time interval 0 1 where 0 is an arbitrarily small parameter we set z t z t and zp t zp t then one has t z t tz t u a t z t z t a z t z t a u a t 23 so if z solves 21 then z solves 4 by theorem 4 3 z t converges to z 0 t t 0 d in c 0 1 this gives for instance that lim 0 z 1 z 0 1 0 one then returns to z thanks to the change of unknowns and setting t 1 implies 22 which completes the claim 5 an example from the literature here we consider the elastic response u u in a first step assuming that the data v are constant in time we study the asymptotic limit 6 and solve it explicitly cf section 5 1 then assuming a specific form of linkages distribution we do not account for any past positions at time t 0 we show in this framework that it is possible to solve explicitly 5 in section 5 2 and we illustrate numerically this fact in the last part 5 1 study of the limit equation 6 proposition 5 1 we suppose that the kernel is non negative and satisfies a t a l 1 r assume that t solves 5 then it is constant and i if 0 then v ii if 0 then v iii if 0 then v iv if v then 0 proof as in the proof of theorem 4 2 if solves 5 with constant data it is constant in the first case if 0 then choosing w 0 implies that w v r a da w a da w 0 a da w w da w 0 da 19 using lebesgue s theorem and taking the limit when w goes to 0 gives that v 0 in a same way if 0 expressing 5 for positive values of w and taking the limit when w 0 provides that v 0 on the other hand if 0 resp 0 then choosing w 0 resp w 0 gives straightforwardly that v resp v which concludes the proof of i and ii taking 0 in 5 provides that v w w which ends the third claim for the last part if there exists two distinct non zero solutions i for i 1 2 if they have the same sign they are equal since then i or ii hold if their signs are opposite then we end up with a contradiction since then v 0 and v 0 at the same time remains the case when one of the two solution only is zero for instance 1 0 in this case again we have a contradiction since then v since 2 6 0 and v if v then 0 is a solution of 5 since v w w w r which is 5 for 0 by uniqueness it is the only one in fig 4 we plot the solution of 5 in the case when a t a and v v 4 2 2 4 4 2 2 4 v v figure 4 the velocity force diagram when u u and r a da 1 5 2 the exact solution of 4 we assume here in 4 that the kernel is such that a t a a t a t thus we solve the problem find z lip r solving v z t w t 0 a u a t da t 0 a u a t w da t 0 24 together with the initial condition z 0 z 0 20 theorem 5 1 assume that is a positive monotone non increasing function in l 1 r we set t t 0 a da that tends to when t goes to infinity let s assume moreover that v then the only solution of 24 is z t z 0 t 0 v d if v 0 z 0 t 0 v d if v 0 25 which tends as t grows large to z z t 1 where t 1 is such that t 1 v proof we assume hereafter that v 0 since the opposite case works the same a simple computation gives that v z t 0 a da t which shows that 0 v t z t on 0 t 1 where t 1 is the time for which t 1 v in this case setting u a t t t a z d shows that u a t 0 for a t a t 0 t 1 2 such that a t t 1 for t fixed one has that u a t is increasing with respect to a 0 t and absolutely continuous thus there exists a w 0 t such that u a t w for all a 0 a 0 w and u a t w for a a 0 w t this gives v z t w w a 0 w 0 a da t a 0 w a da 2 a 0 w 0 a u a t da for all w 0 u t t then passing to the limit wrt w 0 gives thanks to the integrability of a u a t close to a 0 and since a 0 w 0 when w 0 that z t v t so on 0 t 1 z t v t 26 thus u a t t t a v d for every a t t 1 we assume that on t 1 t 1 with a small positive parameter z is negative definite we fix t t 1 t 1 as z is monotone increasing on 0 t 1 there exists 1 such that for all 1 z z t while for 1 t z z t we set 0 a small parameter such that t still belongs to t 1 t 1 there exists 2 depending on such that z is in z t z t 1 for 2 t while z t z for in 0 2 t t see fig 5 one recovers from 24 that v z t z t z t 1 0 z t z t d t 1 z z t t d i 1 t 0 z t z t d i 2 we analyze the terms i 1 and i 2 i 1 z t 1 0 t 1 t d t 1 1 0 z t d 21 1 2 t 1 t t t 1 z 1 z 2 z t 1 t z figure 5 when we assume that z t 0 on t 1 t 1 while i 2 z t t t 2 0 t 2 t d t t 2 0 t 2 z t d this leads to write v z t z t z t z t z t 1 0 t 1 t d 2 2 1 t t z z t t d 0 factorizing the difference z t z t and dividing by leads to write v z t t 2 t 1 z t z t 2 2 1 t t z z t t d i 3 0 as z is monotone either on 1 2 or on t t the latter term can be estimated as i 3 z t z t 2 1 t t t d c z l r o 1 since 2 tends to 1 as tends to zero one concludes making tend to zero that v z t t 2 t 1 z t 0 22 which we divide by z t since it is a positive definite quantity by hypothesis this leads to v t t 1 a da i 4 t t 1 z then assuming that is a monotone non increasing function shows that i 5 t t t 1 a da is decreasing as well thus i 4 t v i 5 t v i 5 1 v 1 0 the latter estimate being true since 1 t 1 which finally gives that t 1 z the latter quantity is strictly positive since t t 1 1 this leads to a contradiction indeed because t 1 v and limt t v there exists an open set m t 1 of positive measure on which a 0 for a e a m since a is decreasing there exist a 0 m such that supm a 0 0 take a 0 t 1 which implies that t t 1 a 0 then t 1 t 1 0 a da a 0 t 1 0 da t 1 a 0 0 thus z cannot be negative definite we assume now that for t t 1 t 1 z t 0 we fix t as above again using 24 one obtains v z t z t 1 z t t 0 z t z t a a da t 0 z t 1 z t a a da which transforms into v z t t z t 1 z t 0 which leads to z v t 0 which again is a contradiction thus z must be zero on a positive neighborhood of t 1 since both arguments extend to any interval i t 1 the claim is proved when v for the particular case when v the time t 1 such that t v is infinite thus 26 remains true on r if v and z t v t if v this can be rewritten as z t z 0 sgn v t 0 a dad z 0 sgn v t 0 a a da t t a da corollary 5 1 under the same hypotheses as above but if v then z t z 0 t 0 v sgn v d z 0 t sgn v t 0 a dad 23 5 3 a numerical illustration we discretize the previous problem using minimizing movements scheme 19 we denote rj exp j a for j n and we approximate the functional i w t t 0 w z t a a da by setting in w a n 1 j 0 w zn 1 j rj and the total energy minimized for each time step n reads en w w zn 1 2 2 t in w v w 27 it is a convex functional with respect to w and there exists a unique minimum for each step n so at each time step tn n t we define zn as zn argmin w r en w one can compare z computed by this minimization scheme with the theoretical formula 25 above we plot in fig 6 the result of this computation
