abstract we obtain explicit characterization of spectral and orbital stability of solitary wave solutions to the u 1 invariant klein gordon equation in one spatial dimension coupled to an anharmonic oscillator we also give the complete analysis of the spectrum of the linearization at a solitary wave 1 introduction in the present article we study the spectral stability of the u 1 invariant klein gordon equation on a line with a concentrated nonlinearity x t 2 x x t m 2 x t x a 0 t 2 0 t x t c x r 1 1 where m 0 above a is a real valued differentiable function so that the model is u 1 invariant the equation is understood in the sense of distributions physically equation 1 1 describes the klein gordon field coupled to a nonlinear oscillator located at x 0 with a 2 being the oscillator force equation 1 1 admits finite energy solutions of the form x e i t r called solitary waves the solitary waves form a two dimensional solitary manifold in the hilbert space of finite energy states of the system we will determine conditions for orbital and spectral stability of solitary waves formulating the results in terms of values of a and a evaluated at 0 2 see theorem 3 6 below then in theorem 4 5 we give the complete description of the spectrum of the linearization at a solitary wave equation 1 1 was proposed to model electron s transitions between bohr s quantum orbits which is one of the fundamental problems of quantum mechanics more precisely 1 1 models the inter action of the electron represented by the anharmonic oscillator with the electromagnetic radiation represented by the klein gordon field the global attraction of any finite energy solution to the set of all solitary waves in local energy norms which was established in kk 07 can be interpreted as the relaxation of a perturbed electron to the bohr orbit where it no longer loses the energy via the radiation in the complete agreement with bohr s postulate on quantum jumps we pursue further properties of the model 1 1 since it is a convenient playground for establishing asymptotic stability results similarly to bkks 08 kks 12 allowing one to explicitly check all the spectral properties of the linearized equation in the present article we will obtain the spectral and 1 http arxiv org abs 2012 04413 v 1 orbital stability results moreover we obtain the complete description of the spectrum of the linearized equation these results will be needed for the subsequent proof of asymptotic stability we point out that many pieces of the spectral analysis which we develop in the present article can be carried over essentially verbatim to models similar to 1 1 such as the models where the concentrated nonlinearity is substituted by its regularized versions such as the self interaction based on the mean field kk 09 we mention that the local and global well posedness of 1 1 has already been proved in kk 07 in kop 09 kop 10 asymptotic stability of solitary waves was obtained for discrete schro dinger and klein gordon equations let us also mention that related results on local well posedness orbital stability and linear instability of solitary waves in the nonlinear klein gordon equation in the external function potential were obtained in cgor 19 the paper is organized as follows the model and its solitary wave solutions are described in section 2 the linearization at a solitary wave is carried out in section 3 where the standard properties of the linearized operator are obtained the detailed structure of the spectrum of the linearized operator is derived in section 4 see theorem 4 5

which are finite energy solutions of the form x t x e i t r x x i x h 1 r 2 5 above h 1 r is the sobolev space of complex valued measurable functions satisfying r x 2 2 dx by 2 1 the frequency r and

solitary wave solution to 1 1 with all possible r lemma 2 3 the set s is given by s x ei x i x ei x ce x 0 2 where m m 2 2 0 and c 0 satisfies the relation a c 2 2 2 7 if a c 2 6 0 then c is locally a c 1 function of proof equation 2 6 implies that 2 x x m 2 2 x x 6 0 and hence x c e x for x 0 where satisfy 2 m 2 2 since h 1 r we conclude that 0 m and that m 2 2 0 since the function x is continuous at x 0 one has c c c thus the solitary waves are solutions of the form x ce x m 2 2 0 c 6 0 2 8 for our convenience we assume that c 0 and write solitary wave solutions in the form x ei ce x m 2 2 0 c

there is the following relation 2 d d 2 d d a c 2 2 4 a c 2 a c 2 c dc d 2 11 which shows that c is locally a c 1 function of as long as a c 2 6 0 3 3 linearization at a solitary wave let us linearize the nonlinear klein gordon 2 1 at a solitary wave e i t i x e i t i x i x where m m r mod 2 and x c e x with m 2 2 0 and c 0 see lemma 2 3 substituting x t e i t i x x x t x x t x 1 x t x 2 x t c 2 3

rewrite 3 3 in the real form for c 2 we denote re im re t im t r 4 the solitary wave x e i t c 2 is then represented by ej t x r 4 where x x 0 0 x j 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 we identify the perturbation x c 2 with the real vector x rex 1 imx 1 rex 2 imx 2 r 4 then 3 3 becomes x x t 0 1 0 0 0 1 2 x m 2 0 0 0 2 x m 2 0 x x t x 0 0 1 2 x 1 0 t x 2 0 t 3 4 where cf 2 7 a c 2 2 0 c 2 a c 2 a c 2 3 5 this gives a system which is c linear 4 remark 3 1 we note that the above definition of is compatible with the pure power case a 0 0 when a 2 2 a 2 let us denote l 2 x m 2 1 2 x 2 3 6 remark 3 2 the domains of all operators which we consider require a careful definition for example a 2 x c x c r is defined as a l 2 r l 2 r with the domain d a h 2 r c h 2 r c x 0 x 0 c 0 where it is selfadjoint lemma 3 3 spectrum of l let m m r the operator l is selfadjoint and satisfies ess l 2 p l 1 2 4 2 2 1 2 where m 2 2 the eigenvalue is simple proof solving the equation 2 x 1 2 x 2 l 2 r we find that has to satisfy 2 and that x ce x 2 x r c 6 0 3 7 while is obtained from the jump condition at x 0 1 2 2 2 this shows that there could only be an eigenvalue if 1 2 taking into account that 2 one arrives at 2 1 2 2 2 so 4 2 2 in particular setting 0 one obtains the point spectrum 0 of l 0 by 2 6 the corresponding eigenvector is in terms of operators 3 6 the system 3 4 reads as x x t a x x t a 0 1 0 0 0 1 l 2 0 0 0 l 0 2 0 3 8 theorem 2 1 generalizes to equation 3 8 for every initial function x x 0 x 0 e the equation admits a unique solution x x t cb r e denote 0 i 2 i 2 0 h l 2 0 0 0 l 0 2 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 then the operator a from 3 8 corresponding to a linearization at the solitary wave is factored into a h 5 denote g 1 g 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 g 2 g 1 2 i 2 0 0 2 3 9 and consider the conjugated version of h h g 2 g 1 h g 1 1 g 1 2 l 2 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 l 0 2 0 0 1 h 0 0 h 0 3 10 we start with the spectrum of h l 2 1 3 11 lemma 3 4 for any r the essential spectrum of h is given by 1 ess h m 2 0 c 1 c m m 0 where c m 2 1 m 2 1 2 4 2 2 we note that 0 c min 1 m 2 c max 1 m 2 2 p h 1 2 m m 0 1 1 2 0 1 2 m m with the eigenvalues given by 2 1 2 1 2 4 2 3 12 with 4 2 2 when 1 2 from lemma 3 3 in particular 0 p h if and only if 0 and p h 0 0 2 1 with the corresponding eigenvectors 0 x x x 2 1 x x x proof let us compute the essential spectrum ofh since x is a relatively compact perturbation of the laplacian in one dimension by the weyl theorem when computing the essential spectrum of h we can replace l in 3 11 by l 0 2 x m 2 2 then the values of the essential spectrum are those c such that det 2 2 1 1 2 m 2 2 1 0 for some r 3 13 6 thus either 1 or expressing 2 in terms of we arrive at the inequality m 2 2 1 m 2 1 2 1 2 m 2 1 m 2 2 1 0 3 14 there are two roots c of the numerator and root 1 of the denominator these roots satisfy the inequalities 0 c 1 c m m 0 we note that when 0 one has c 0 1 if m 2 1 and c 0 1 if m 2 1 we conclude that the essential spectrum the set where 3 13 is satisfied is given by the intervals c 1 c let us now study the point spectrum of h first let us consider when 1 is an eigenvalue of h one can see from 3 11 that this is only possible when 0 with eigenfunctions of the form 0 u 2 x u 2 l 2 r in this case the rest of the point spectrum comes from lemma 3 3 0 4 m 2 2 in the case 1 2 agreeing with 0 1 and 0 0 from 3 12 now we consider the case 6 1 the operator h i 2 l 2 1 3 15 has zero eigenvalue if and only if so does the schur complement of 1 which is given by l 2 2 1 l 2 1 thus 6 1 is an eigenvalue of h if and only if 2 1 3 16 is an eigenvalue of l see figure 1 now the proof follows from lemma 3 3 leading to the expressions 3 12 let us point out that the eigenfunctions corresponding to 6 1 are given by cf 3 7 u x 1 e x 2 3 17 lemma 3 4 gives the spectrum of the selfadjoint operator h l 2 r c 4 l 2 r c 4 corollary 3 5 for any r the essential spectrum of h is given by ess h c 1 c for 0 one has h 0 with eigenvalue 0 of multiplicity one for 0 one has h 0 0 with eigenvalue 0 of multiplicity two for 0 when from lemma 3 3 is negative the operator h has exactly one simple negative eigenvalue given by 3 12 the following theorem gives the orbital stability result for solitary wave solutions to 1 1 7 s s s 0 s s 1 0 l h 2 c c 2 1 figure 1 the relation between l and h for 6 0 0 theorem 3 6 assume that there are solitary wave solutions for 1 2 m m the solitary wave x e i t is orbitally stable if and only if 2 m 2 above 0 2 a 0 2 a 0 2 could be negative see 3 5 let us recall that for nonzero solitary waves a 0 2 6 0 proof the grillakis shatah strauss theory gss 87 applies when either h 0 with 0 a simple eigenvalue with the corresponding eigenvector j satisfying the assumptions of gss 87 theorem 1 when 0 or h has a negative spectrum consisting of one simple eigenvalue has its kernel spanned by j while the rest of its spectrum is positive and separated away from z 0 satisfying the assumptions of gss 87 theorem 2 in the case 0 the operator a 0 i 1 l 0 2 i in the right hand side of 3 3 is c linear moreover it can be represented as a 0 jh 0 where j 0 1 1 0 h 0 l 0 2 i i 1 the operator h 0 has the same spectral properties as the operator h 0 namely ess h 0 c 1 c p h 0 0 2 1 with eigenvalue 0 being simple hence gss 87 theorems 1 applies showing that the solitary wave x e i t is orbitally stable the instability in the case 2 m 2 follows from gss 87 theorem 3 in the critical case the instability follows from the jordan block structure of the zero eigenvalue see e g cp 03 the spectrum of the linearization at a solitary wave also follows from the arguments in kol 73 and gss 87 we consider it next lemma 3 7 spectrum of a basic properties 1 if belongs to p a then so do and 2 ess a i r m m 8 3 p a r ir there is a pair of a positive and a negative eigenvalues of a if and only if 0 and min m with m 3 18 4 if m m and 6 0 2 m 2 then the zero eigenvalue of a is of geometric multiplicity 1 and of algebraic multiplicity 2 5 if m m 0 and 2 m 2 then the zero eigenvalue of a is of geometric multiplicity 1 and of algebraic multiplicity 4 6 if m m 0 and 0 then the zero eigenvalue of a is of geometric multiplicity 2 and of algebraic multiplicity 2 7 if 0 and 0 then eigenvalue z 0 of a is of geometric multiplicity 2 and of algebraic multiplicity 4 proof we follow the arguments of kolokolov kol 73 and grillakis shatah strauss gss 87 for part 1 one notices that a has real coefficients hence is also an eigenvalue and then that a h which is conjugate to h hence is also an eigenvalue part 2 follows by fixing ir with m and considering the weyl sequences supported away from x 0 to prove part 3 it is convenient to write a from 3 8 in the form similar to the nonlinear schro dinger theory kol 73 we consider the conjugated versions of and h with h g 2 g 1 h g 1 1 g 1 2 from 3 10 and with g 2 g 1 g 1 1 g 1 2 i 0 1 1 0 3 19 now we are in the framework of a kolokolov kol 73 consider the eigenvalue problem for h h i 0 1 1 0 h 0 0 h 0 u v u v u v l 2 r c 4 3 20 first we notice that if 0 then h is nonnegative and selfadjoint hence one can extract the square root also nonnegative and selfadjoint therefore d h 0 d h 1 2 h 1 2 0 ir since h 1 2 h 1 2 is antiselfadjoint from now on we assume that 0 eliminating v we get 1 h 0 1 h u 2 u u l 2 r c 2 for 6 0 one can see that u is orthogonal to ker 1 h 0 1 ker 1 l 0 2 3 21 cf 2 6 hence we can write h u 2 1 h 0 1 1 u 2 1 h 0 1 1 u 9 coupling this relation with u and taking into account that u 1 h 0 1 1 u 0 we see that 2 r to find whether 2 can be negative one considers the minimization problem inf u h u u u 1 u ker 1 h 0 1 3 22 which implies that u satisfies h u u 3 23 with r the lagrange multipliers we note that if 0 then 6 0 or else one would have the only negative eigenvalue of h which is not possible since u x from 3 17 corresponding to eigenvalue is not orthogonal to ker 1 h 0 1 one has u 1 1 e x 2 e x 2 e x 2 e x where 2 is strictly positive so 6 0 or else would have to be positive then one concludes from 3 22 that we rewrite 3 23 as h u u h 1 the sign of could be found from the condition that u is orthogonal to ker 1 h 0 1 h z 1 0 we consider h z h z 1 z c h since h z is monotonically increasing on h the sign of is opposite to the sign of h 0 which is given by h 0 h 1 2 3 24 above we used the relation h l 2 1 3 25 which in turn follows from taking the derivative of 2 6 after we substitute x which yields l 2 3 26 we conclude from 3 24 that there is 2 0 hence there is a pair of a positive and a negative eigenvalues if and only if h 0 2 0 let us prove parts 4 and 5 given m m let us compute the geometric multiplicity of 0 we consider a h with from 3 19 and h from 3 10 since 6 0 by lemma 3 4 the geometric multiplicity of 0 equals 1 with ker h span x e 3 x e 4 10 with ei 1 i 4 the standard basis in c 4 now let us compute the algebraic multiplicity of 0 by 3 21 and 3 25 we have h 0 0 i 0 1 1 0 h 0 0 h 0 0 0 0 h 0 0 i 0 1 1 0 h 0 0 h 0 0 0 i 0 0 3 27 thus 0 is an eigenvalue of h of multiplicity at least two to be able to extend this jordan chain solving h 0 0 c 4 3 28 we need to make sure that the right hand side is orthogonal to the kernel of the adjoint of the operator in the left hand side ker h span 0 0 thus the condition to have a jordan block of a larger size is 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 29 let us compute explicitly the right hand side in 3 29 since 2 c 2 see lemma 2 3 one computes d d 2 c 2 2 c dc d c 2 3 1 3 m 2 c 2 2 a c 2 a c 2 c 2 3 m 2 2 3 30 where c c to express dc d we used 2 11 thus if 6 0 2 0 if and only if 2 m 2 we will consider the case 0 separately if 6 2 m 2 6 0 since the condition 3 29 is not satisfied equation 3 28 has no l 2 solutions hence the algebraic multiplicity is exactly two if 2 m 2 0 then equation 3 28 has an l 2 solution the algebraic multiplicity jumps by at least one this means that an eigenvalue arrives at z 0 by the symmetry of a with respect to r and ir there is also the opposite sign eigenvalue arriving at z 0 thus the algebraic multiplicity of z 0 jumps by two standard considerations see e g cp 03 show that for 6 the algebraic multiplicity of zero eigenvalue can not be more than four indeed let us show that the equation h 4 x e 3 x e 4 l 2 r c 4 11 has no solutions if the algebraic multiplicity of 0 is at least four hence 2 m 2 so that there are l 2 r c 4 such that h e 1 e 2 h 3 31 where as one can readily see from the block form of h see 3 20 one can decompose x 3 x e 3 4 x e 4 then trying to solve h 2 l 2 r c 4 we need to make sure that is orthogonal to the kernel of h 2 h 2 which contains in particular e 1 e 2 h h we arrive at the following necessary condition h 0 3 32 taking into account that h h 0 0 h 0 is semi positive definite on vectors of the form 3 x e 3 4 x e 4 with the one dimensional kernel this follows from lemma 3 4 while by 3 31 the function is not in this kernel we conclude that the left hand side is strictly positive hence the condition 3 32 can not be satisfied for part 6 we consider the case 6 0 0 by lemma 3 4 the geometric multiplicity of 0 equals 2 with ker h 0 span x e 1 x e 2 x e 3 x e 4 to have a jordan block we would need to solve h 0 x e 4 i 0 1 1 0 h 0 0 0 h 0 i x e 1 3 33 since 6 0 the right hand side of 3 33 is not orthogonal to ker h 0 ker h 0 x x 0 0 hence 3 33 has no solutions finally for part 7 we consider the case 0 0 in this case the geometric multiplicity of 0 equals 2 with ker h 0 0 span x e 1 x e 3 the jordan block corresponding to x e 1 is of size at least two since h 0 0 x e 4 i 0 1 1 0 h 0 0 0 0 h 0 0 x e 4 i x e 1 now we notice that x e 4 is not orthogonal to ker h 0 0 which contains x e 4 therefore the corresponding jordan block is of size exactly two similarly there is a jordan block of size exactly two corresponding to x e 3 this completes the proof of lemma 3 7 remark 3 8 by lemma 3 7 3 there is a positive eigenvalue of a if and only if 2 min m 2 m 2 we see from 3 30 that in this case one has 2 0 since the charge of the klein gordon field is given by q 2 see 2 4 the above is in agreement with the kolokolov stability condition q 0 3 34 derived in kol 73 in the context of the nonlinear schro dinger equation 12 4 the spectrum of the linearization operator now we are going to perform a complete analysis of the spectrum of the linearization operator for convenience we consider the linearization operator a from 3 8 using 0 as a parameter recall that a 0 1 0 0 0 1 2 x m 2 1 2 x 0 0 0 2 x m 2 x 0 2 m 2 2 4 1 for x 6 0 substituting x we x with some c re 0 into the equation a 0 we get 1 0 0 1 2 m 2 0 0 2 m 2 w 0 c w c 4 w 6 0 4 2 which via the schur complement idea is equivalent to 1 0 0 1 s 0 0 0 0 w 0 w c 4 w 6 0 4 3 with s end c 2 the schur complement of the top right block i 2 s 2 m 2 0 0 2 m 2 2 2 m 2 2 2 2 2 2 m 2 2 2 4 4 the condition to have nonzero solution w c 4 to 4 3 is equivalent to dets m 2 2 2 2 2 4 2 2 0 this gives m 2 2 2 2 2 i m 2 2 2 2 2 i m 2 i 2 2 m 2 i 2 2 allowing one to express c in terms of and m 2 i 2 we choose the cuts in the complex plane from the branching points to infinity c i i m i m i c i i m i m i defining m 2 i 2 4 5 with re 0 c c 4 6 13 the zero eigenvalue of the schur complement s from 4 4 corresponds to two eigenvectors u c 2 depending on the choice these eigenvectors are given by 2 m 2 2 2 2 2 m 2 2 m 2 2 2 2 i 2 2 1 i so we can use u 1 i by 4 3 the corresponding vector from the null space of a i is then w u v c 4 with v u i i c 2 thus one has w 1 i i i c 4 therefore an eigenfunction corresponding to the eigenvalue c is of the form x aw e x bw e x a 1 i i i e x b 1 i i i e x 4 7 with a b c not simultaneously zeros and re 0 when the corresponding coefficient is nonzero the values of a and b are obtained from the jump conditions at x 0 substituting into a 0 and collecting the terms with function gives 2 1 2 a 2 1 2 b 0 2 ia 2 ib 0 4 8 the condition to have a b c not simultaneously zeros det 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 2 0 takes the form 8 4 1 2 2 1 2 0 which we rewrite as d 0 4 9 with d 2 1 2 2 1 4 2 2 4 10 with 2 m 2 2 from 3 5 and m 2 i 2 from 4 5 the function d is analytic in in c c c since there are two possible values for each of the square roots in the definition 4 5 of d can be continuied analytically through the cuts c and c to an analytic function on the four sheet cover of c which we also denote by d we call the sheet defined by conditions 4 6 the physical sheet of d 4 1 embedded eigenvalues and virtual levels we start by studying embedded eigenvalues and virtual levels of the operator a before formu lating our results let us mention that a virtual level also known as a threshold resonance can be defined as a limit point of an eigenvalue family which corresponds to values of a perturbation param eter in an interval when this limit point no longer corresponds to a square integrable eigenfunction the virtual levels usually occur at thresholds of the essential spectrum the endpoints of the essential spectrum or the points where the continuous spectrum changes its multiplicity for more on the phenomenon of virtual levels see e g jk 79 jn 01 yaf 10 gn 20 egt 19 14 lemma 4 1 embedded eigenvalues and virtual levels of a 1 there are embedded eigenvalues 2 i if and only if 0 and m 3 2 for any r and m m 0 there are no virtual levels at the embedded thresholds i m 3 there are virtual levels at i m if and only if 1 2 1 2 and t where t m 1 2 2 3 4 4 11 in particular im are virtual levels if and only if 1 2 and 0 by part 1 these are genuine virtual levels with non l 2 eigenfunction if and only if 6 0 proof because of the symmetry with respect to the sign of we will assume that 0 m for part 1 it suffices to consider i with m in this case m 2 2 ir therefore in the expression for the corresponding eigenfunction 4 7 one would need to take b 0 there are two cases to consider if 6 0 the system 4 8 shows that one would also have a 0 hence can not be an eigenvalue if 0 and m 3 m there is an embedded eigenvalue 2 i since the system 4 8 is satisfied for b 0 and any a c note that in this case 2 m and 2 for part 2 it is enough to consider 0 m i m at this value of one has 0 m 2 m 2 2 ir 0 thus d i m 2 1 2 2 1 can not be zero since 0 in the case 0 one has 0 and then d im 0 if and only if 1 2 for part 3 we need to consider 0 m i m in this case 0 m 2 2 m 2 2 m 0 by 4 6 we need to solve 0 d i m 2 1 2 2 1 the equation has no solution for 1 in the case 6 1 it is equivalent to m 2 2 1 2 1 2 m which leads to t m 1 2 2 3 4 m 1 4 1 4 3 4 4 12 we note that 0 t m as long as 1 2 1 2 15 4 2 discrete spectrum now we will study the discrete spectrum of the operator a recall that for any r and m m the operator has zero eigenvalue of of multiplicity 2 we start with the special cases 0 and 0 lemma 4 2 eigenvalues of a 0 6 0 p a 0 0 2 i 0 m with eigenvalues 2 i being simple the only eigenvalue of a 0 0 is 0 of algebraic multi plicity 4 and geometric multiplicity 2 proof considering for which values the matrix a 0 i 4 1 0 0 0 1 l 0 2 0 0 l 0 2 4 13 has eigenvalue zero reduces to studying this question for the schur complement of the top right block i 2 s l 0 2 0 0 l 0 2 2 l 0 2 2 2 l 0 2 4 14 by lemma 3 3 l 0 has the only eigenvalue 0 we conclude that can be obtained from the equation det 2 2 2 2 0 which gives 0 and 2 i recall that the eigenvalues 2 i are embedded into the essential spectrum if m 3 in the case 0 the geometric multiplicity could be obtained from sub stituting 0 0 and 0 into 4 13 and taking into account that 0 0 is a simple eigenvalue of l 0 lemma 3 3 lemma 4 3 eigenvalues of a 0 p a 0 0 1 2 2 m 1 1 2 the eigenvalues 2 m 1 are simple real if 0 and purely imaginary if 1 2 0 proof in the case 0 one has m 2 2 and 2 m then d 0 4 m 2 1 2 8 m 1 m 2 2 4 m 2 2 8 m 2 1 4 2 8 m 1 m 2 2 in the case 1 d 0 has the only root 0 of multiplicity 2 for 6 1 d 0 0 if and only if 2 m 2 2 1 0 and 2 m 2 2 1 2 4 m 2 m 2 2 4 15 the second condition gives 2 0 and 2 1 4 m 2 using the first condition of 4 15 we conclude that 1 2 and then 2 m 1 16 denote k m 2 2 m 2 2 m 2 2 m 2 2 m 1 2 2 m m m 4 16 we note that k 0 for m 3 and k 0 for m 3 4 17 we note also that for 0 m the function 7 k is the inverse to the function 7 t defined in 4 11 lemma 4 4 for m m and 0 0 k p a 0 proof for 0 the statement follows from lemma 4 3 because of the symmetry with respect to the sign of it suffices to consider 0 m due to lemma 3 7 3 it suffices to prove that p a ir 0 0 0 k 0 m it suffices to prove that d 6 0 ir 0 0 0 k 0 m 4 18 with d defined in 4 10 we rewrite d as d 2 2 2 4 19 note that 2 i are not roots of d 6 0 for 0 and 6 0 indeed for 2 i one has 2 0 and then d 2 i 2 2 m 2 2 2 m 2 9 2 6 0 the case 2 i is treated similarly for 6 0 2 i we may rewrite 4 19 as d 2 2 1 1 2 1 2 it remains to prove that for 0 m and 0 0 k the equation 1 1 2 1 2 0 has no solutions ir 0 2 i denoting i we rewrite the above equation as 1 q 0 4 20 where q 1 m 2 2 m 2 2 1 m 2 2 m 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 4 21 due to 4 17 it suffices to prove that there are no solution to 4 20 in the following domains 1 0 m 3 t 0 2 m 17 2 0 m 3 t 0 0 2 3 m 3 m 0 t 0 m 1 note that q 0 for 2 m and q m 2 2 m 2 2 2 0 hence inf 2 m q q m 1 1 m 2 2 m 2 1 2 m 2 2 2 m m 2 2 2 m 1 2 m 2 m 2 1 2 2 m 1 2 m 1 k 1 0 4 22 and q k q m 1 therefore 4 20 has no solutions in the first domain 2 note that 0 min 2 m in the second and the third domains hence 2 2 and the following expansion holds m 2 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 n 2 2 n 3 n 2 n n 2 n 2 n the above leads to m 2 2 2 2 2 1 2 n 2 2 n 3 n 1 2 n 1 n 2 n 2 n 1 and then we derive from 4 21 q m 2 2 2 m 2 2 2 1 4 4 2 2 n 1 2 n 1 n 2 n 2 n n 1 2 n 1 2 n 1 0 4 23 since each summand in n 1 is positive for 0 2 this immediately implies that 4 20 has no solution in the second domain 3 in the third domain m 2 let us show that q decreases monotonically on 0 m indeed 4 23 implies q 8 4 2 2 2 n 1 2 n 1 n n 1 2 n 2 n n 1 2 n 1 2 n 1 n 1 2 n 1 n n 2 n 1 2 n 1 n 1 2 n 1 2 n 1 0 hence similarly to 4 22 sup 0 m q q m 1 m 2 2 m 2 1 1 k 1 18 and q k q m 1 hence 4 20 has no solutions in this domain now we collect all the facts about the eigenvalues obtained above theorem 4 5 eigenvalues of a 1 for 2 m 2 one has p a 0 of algebraic multiplicity 4 its geometric multiplicity is 1 if 6 0 and 2 if 0 2 for 6 0 0 one has p a 0 0 2 i 2 i ess a when m 3 3 for 2 m 2 one has p a 0 with some 0 4 for k 2 m 2 one has p a 0 i 0 5 k 6 0 one has p a 0 0 5 0 0 5 1 1 0 5 0 0 5 1 m t 2 1 2 embedded eigenvalue when 0 embedded eigenvalue when 0 no nonzero eigenvalues eigenvalues i real eigenvalues figure 2 location of simple eigenvalues for different values of parameters r and m m the values of on the kolokolov curve 2 m 2 correspond to collision of two simple eigenvalues at 0 as indicated by the kolokolov condition the values of on the virtual level curve t blue curves for 1 2 1 2 correspond to virtual levels at thresholds i m the regions between the kolokolov and virtual level lines dots on the plot correspond to two simple purely imaginary eigenvalues i in the spectral gap the values m 3 at 0 correspond to embedded eigenvalues 2 i besides eigenvalues mentioned on this plot there is always eigenvalue 0 proof part 1 in the case 6 0 follows from lemma 3 7 5 and from lemma 4 2 in the case 0 moreover in the case 6 0 one can arrive at the same conclusion from considering the function d we have d 2 2 1 q i 4 24 19 we notice that 2 2 2 2 i o 0 moreover by 4 23 q i 1 2 1 2 4 2 o 2 1 2 o 2 m 2 2 o 2 2 therefore 1 q i 1 m 2 2 o 2 o 1 6 o 2 2 it follows that if then 0 is a root of 4 24 of order four part 2 follows from lemma 4 2 and part 3 follows from lemma 3 7 3 let us prove part 4 by part 1 for p a 0 of algebraic multiplicity 4 for the two nonzero eigenvalues start moving away from the origin becoming purely real for and purely imaginary for these two purely imaginary eigenvalues hit the threshold points i m at some values t with t m becoming virtual levels see lemma 4 1 since by part 1 there are no eigenvalues at this threshold it remains to note that t corresponds to k indeed solving 4 12 we get k 1 2 2 m 2 m m 1 2 m 1 2 1 2 2 m 1 2 the condition for t to be smaller than m so that the root of d indeed arrives at i m when t m m is 1 2 2 3 4 which gives the requirement 12 1 2 part 5 follows from lemma 4 4 the absence of nonzero roots for k 6 0 is explained by the fact that that when we passing the thresholds k the nonzero root of d moves onto the unphysical sheet of the riemann surface of d recall that in the case 0 m 3 the point spectrum also contains embedded eigenvalues 2 i by lemma 4 1 1 this completes the proof of theorem 4 5 a appendix reducing d 0 to a cubic with explicit solution for the completeness we provide an explicit solution to the equation d 0 with d from 4 10 which we can cast as a cubic equation albeit explicit this solution does not yield the spectral properties of a as readily as the methods employed in section 4 yet this solution enables for example the analysis of large asymptotics of roots of d on physical and unphysical sheets of the riemann surface of d denote with from 4 5 one has 2 2 2 2 2 2 m 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 then 4 9 takes the form 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 a 1 and then 2 1 2 2 2 0 equation a 1 implies 1 2 1 2 8 2 2 a 2 20 further from a 1 and a 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 2 1 2 1 2 2 2 2 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 8 2 2 2 2 1 2 2 1 2 8 2 so 2 2 4 4 16 2 1 2 16 2 1 2 8 2 3 1 2 8 2 1 2 8 2 a 3 on the other side the definition of 4 5 implies that 2 2 i 2 m 2 i 2 m 2 m 2 2 m 2 2 2 m 2 2 4 2 2 2 m 2 4 16 4 4 2 m 2 2 2 2 a 4 from a 3 and a 4 simplifying and denoting x 2 we obtain x 2 4 xm 2 x 2 4 4 8 4 2 8 x 2 2 2 x 2 3 1 2 8 2 1 2 8 x a 5 defining c 4 m 2 2 2 2 2 2 a 6 and squaring a 5 yields x 2 cx 4 2 1 2 8 2 8 1 2 2 4 64 6 1 2 4 x 8 there is a root x 0 to find nonzero roots we simplify the above and cancel x arriving at x 3 2 cx 2 x c 2 4 2 1 2 4 c 4 2 1 2 4 6 1 2 4 8 0 a 7 writing x y 2 c 3 a 8 we reduce the cubic equation a 7 to the form y 3 py q 0 a 9 with p c 2 3 4 2 1 2 4 q 2 c 3 27 c 4 2 1 2 12 6 1 2 4 8 a 10 if the discriminant 4 p 3 27 q 2 a 11 with c c from a 6 is negative then there is exactly one real root y r of equation a 9 and two complex conjugate roots with nonzero imaginary part the real root is given by y 1 q 2 1 2 108 1 3 q 2 1 2 108 1 3 and then a 8 yields x 1 q 2 1 2 108 1 3 q 2 1 2 108 1 3 2 c 3 a 12 21 let us mention that roots of a 9 with nonzero imaginary part correspond to roots y 2 c 3 of d with nonzero real and imaginary parts by lemma 3 7 3 these roots do not correspond to eigenvalues of a we are going to show that the discriminant is negative either if m is sufficiently close to m or if is sufficiently large so that there is exactly one real solution to a 9 and therefore exactly one pair of roots to d 0 which are located on the riemann sheet corresponding to eigenvalues of a that is when the real parts of and from 4 5 are positive lemma a 1 1 there is 0 0 such that 0 for 0 2 for each r 1 0 there is 0 m such that 0 for m proof using a 10 one computes 4 p 3 27 q 2 6 4 1 2 2 c 3 c 2 2 1 2 8 9 c 4 2 1 2 8 6 2 1 2 1 2 8 27 6 1 2 4 32 since c 4 m 2 2 1 2 2 one concludes that for each fixed r different from 1 and 0 0 if 2 m 2 2 is sufficiently small that is if is sufficiently close to m alternatively one can keep the highest order powers of substituting c 2 2 2 and getting 6 6 1 2 6 6 8 4 4 4 2 2 16 2 2 2 9 4 4 16 6 6 16 27 6 6 64 12 12 8 showing that is strictly negative for large enough remark a 2 let us note that for one has c 2 2 2 1 2 6 6 2 2 q 2 27 c 3 6 6 8 29 27 6 6 8 and a 12 yields x 1 6 6 8 1 108 6 6 2 2 1 3 6 6 8 1 108 6 6 2 2 1 3 2 3 2 2 2 c 2 2 with some c 1 showing that 1 2 x 1 are real for 0 these values 1 2 are exactly the two real nonzero eigenvalues of a which appear in theorem 4 5 3 for 0 since a has no real eigenvalues lemma 3 7 3 1 2 correspond to resonances of a that is to zeros of 4 10 on one of the unphysical riemann sheets of d the expression a 12 can be used to analyze zero eigenvalues of a lemma a 3 x 1 0 in the following cases 1 0 and 2 m 2 proof since x 1 0 corresponds to y 1 2 c 3 see a 8 we need to solve 2 c 3 3 2 c 3 p q 0 substituting c from a 6 p q from a 10 and simplifying one arrives at 4 m 2 1 2 2 2 4 2 1 2 4 6 1 2 4 8 0 canceling common factors corresponding to solutions 1 and 0 one obtains 2 m 2 remark a 4 the value 2 m 2 is in agreement with the value of from 3 18 by lemma 3 7 we know that only the cases 0 and 2 m 2 correspond to higher algebraic multiplicity of eigenvalue 0 while the case 1 has to correspond to resonances one can see from 4 10 that in this case the values 0 are located on the riemann sheet of d characterized by 0 22 references bkks 08 v buslaev a komech e kopylova and d stuart on asymptotic stability of solitary waves in
