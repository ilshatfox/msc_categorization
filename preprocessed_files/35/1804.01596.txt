properties of solutions to the zakharov kuznetsov equation of plasma physic given two sufficiently regular solutions u 1 u 2 we prove that if u 1 u 2 decays fast enough at two distinct times then u 1 u 2 1 introduction this paper is concerned with uniqueness properties results for solutions of the so called zakharov kuznetsov equation btu b 3 xu bxb 2 yu ubxu 0 px yq p r 2 t p r 0 1 s 1 equation 1 is one of the variants of the p 2 1 q dimensional generalization of the korteweg de vries kdv equation that reads btu b 3 xu ubxu 0 x p r t p r 0 1 s 2 the equation was introduced in the context of plasma physic by zakharov and kuznetsov in 38 where they formally deduced that the propagation of nonlinear ion acoustic waves in magnetized plasma is governed by this mathematical model a rigorous derivation of equation 1 was given by lannes linares and saut in 29 the problem of local and global well posedness for the cauchy problem associated to 1 has extensively been studied up to date the best local well posedness result available in the literature was obtained independently by molinet and pilod 33 and gr nrock and herr 16 for initial data in hspr 2 q s 1 2 then the global theory follows by standard arguments based on l 2 and h 1 conservation laws we refer to 14 30 32 and references therein for other results of this type and several additional remarks concerning with properties of this equation our main goal is to prove uniqueness properties from two distinct times for equation 1 more precisely we want to deduce sufficient conditions on the behavior of the difference u 1 u 2 of two solutions u 1 u 2 of 1 at two different times t 0 0 and t 1 1 which guarantee that u 1 u 2 this kind of results is inspired to the program performed in 7 12 for schr dinger and kdv see also 37 and remark 1 1 below for further details the main motivation for our study is a recent work by bustamante isaza and mej a 4 where an upper bound for the possible decay at two different times of a non trivial difference of two solutions of 1 was given more precisely they prove the following theorem 1 1 4 suppose that for some small 0 u 1 u 2 p c r 0 1 s h 4 pr 2 q x l 2 pp

1 2 lucrezia cossetti luca fanelli and felipe linares remark 1 1 as the authors in 4 pointed out this result does not appear to be optimal indeed the symmetric character in x and y of the decay assumption does not reflect the non symmetric form with respect to x and y of equation 1 to explain this fact let us sketch the analog picture for kdv and schr dinger equations as regards with the kdv equation escauriaza kenig ponce and vega in 9 considering u 1 and u 2 two solutions of btu b 3 xu ubxu 0 px tq p r r 0 1 s 3 deduced that there exists a universal constant a 0 0 such that if for some

value 3 2 in the exponent in 4 arises in the asymptotic behavior of the airy function while the gaussian decay is known to be the sharpest possible simultaneous decay for both a function f and its fourier transform pf which explains 6 together with the aid of the explicit formula for the schr dinger kernel for the zk equation one might expect to have a sharp decay of the form e ax 3 2 by 2 this is because of the decay of the fundamental solution of kdv and the gaussian parabolic heritage arising from the fourier uncertainty recently faminskii and antonova in 15 showed that the previous natural ansatz for the decay assumption is wrong they proved that the fundamental solution to the operator bt b 3 x bxb 2 y still displays an exponential decay but just in the x variable more precisely considering the ivp btu b 3 xu bxb 2 yu 0 upx y 0 q u 0 px yq whose solution given as a convolution by upx y tq ptq t 2 3 s x t 1 3 y t 1 3 u 0 px yq where spx yq 1 2 f 1 p q eip 3 2 q 1 4 2

precisely we prove the following unique continuation for z k equation 3 theorem 1 2 suppose that for some small 0 u 1 u 2 p c r 0 1 s h 4 pr 2 q x l 2 pp 1 x q 2 p 4 3 q dxdyq x c 1 pr 0 1 s l 2 pr 2

obtain this result following 16 we introduce the linear change of variables x x 1 y 1 2 y x 1 y 1 2 11 with 3 and 4 1 3 it turns out that if u upx y tq solves 1 then rupx 1 y 1 tq u x 1 y 1 2 x 1 y 1

therefore theorem 1 2 is a consequence of the following result theorem 1 3 suppose that for some 0 u 1 u 2 p c r 0 1 s h 4 pr 2 q x l 2 pp 1 x y q 2 p 43 q dxdyq x c 1 pr 0 1 s l 2 pr 2 qq 13 are

we state the following linear result for 15 actually it is considered a slightly more general equation than 15 theorem 1 4 suppose that for some small 0 v p c r 0 1 s h 3 pr 2 q x l 2 pp 1 x y q 2 p

exists a universal constant a 0 0 such that if for some a a 0 vp 0 q vp 1 q p l 2 pea x y 3 2 dxdyq then v 0 we shall see that under the hypotheses of theorem 1 3 15 turns out to be a particular case of 16 with a 0 4 1 3 pbx byqu 2 and a 1 4 1 3 u 1 therefore our result in theorem 1 3 will follow as a consequence of the validity of theorem 1 4 4 lucrezia cossetti luca fanelli and felipe linares the optimality of theorem 1 3 and thus of theorem 1 2 is proved in the following theorem theorem 1 5 suppose that for some 0 u p c r 0 1 s h 4 pr 2 q x l 2 pp 1 x y q 2 p 4 3 q dxdyq x c 1 pr 0 1 s l

1 4 and of its nonlinear counterpart theorem 1 3 in order to do that following the scheme in 9 we introduce two types of estimates a lower bound which follows after performing a suitable carleman estimate and an upper bound for the h 2 norm of the solutions which exploits the exponential decay assumed for the initial and final data in section 3 our main result theorem 1 2 for the original z k equation is proved finally in section 4 the proof of theorem 1 5 is given acknowledgment the authors would like to thank pedro caro for helpful comments and suggestions the research of l c is

theorems 1 3 1 4 this section is concerned with the proof of theorems 1 3 1 4 as sketched above we will prove a lower and an upper bound in suitable weighted norms for the solution v to 16 and then perform a contradiction argument 2 1 lower bound this subsection is mainly interested in the proof of the following result theorem 2 1 let v p cpr 0 1 s h 3 pr 2 qq be a solution of 16 with a 0 a 1 p l 8 pr 3 q assume that r 2 1 0 v 2 v 2 v 2 dx dy dt a 2 let 0 r p p 0 1 2 q and q tpx y tq a x 2 y 2 1 t p rr 1 rsu and suppose that v l 2 pqq then there exist constants rr 0 c 0 c 1 depending on a a

the previous idea of establishing lower bounds for the asymptotic behavior of a suitable norm of the solution in an annulus domain stems from a work by bourgain and kenig 2 on a class of stationary schr dinger operators v pxq in which the property of spectral localization that is the phenomenon for which the point spectrum of the analyzed operator presents exponentially decaying eigenfunctions is studied in that work they needed precise quantitative information on the rate of local vanishing for eigenfunctions more precisely local bounds on the eigenfunctions both from above and from below were required unlike the upper bound which just needs classical tools to be achieved the lower bound is a more subtle issue the statement lemma 3 10 in 2 is as follows lemma 2 1 let u be a bounded solution of u v u 0 in r with suitable additional assumptions about v let x 0 p rn x 0 r 1 then max r 1 x r upxq c 0 e c 1 plogrqr 4 3 this was derived from the following carleman type estimate lemma 2 2 there are constants c 1 c 2 c 3 depending only on n and an increasing function w wprq for 0 r 10 such that 1 c 1 wprq r c 1 and for all f p c 80 pb 10 zt 0 uq c 2 we have 3 rd w 1 2 f 2 c 3 rd w 2 2 p fq 2 in order to obtain the lower bound in theorem 2 1 in the same spirit as bourgain and kenig we will start performing a carleman estimate for our operator p bt pb 3 x b 3 yq a 1 px y tqpbx byq a 0 px y tq 17 where a 0 a 1 p l 8 pr 3 q as a starting point we will prove the following carleman estimate for the leading part of the operator p namely bt b 3 x b 3 y 6 lucrezia cossetti luca fanelli and felipe linares lemma 2 3 assume that r 0 1 s r is a smooth function then there exist two constants c 0 and m 1 m 1 p 1 8 2 8 q 0 such that the inequality 5 2 r 3 e px y tq px y tq g l 2 pr

and px y tq r ptq 2 x r ptq 2 y r ptq 2 with px yq and p 1 1 q remark 2 1 in order to obtain from the previous result an estimate involving the whole operator p as defined in 17 a very essential role is played by the multiplicative parameter on the left hand side of 18 indeed by taking sufficiently large we can make the term on the left hand side as large as we need in order to absorb potential lower order terms this fact can be seen at work explicitly in the proof of lemma 2 4 below where a carleman estimate for the whole operator p bt b 3 x b 3 y a 1 pbx byq a 0 is given indeed by virtue of the assumption 2 m 1 r 3 in lemma 2 3 the terms 5 2 r 3 and 3 2 r 2 grow as a positive fractional power of r therefore being r a large parameter it will allow us to include in the estimate lower order derivatives proof from now on with an abuse of notation we will write l 2 instead of l 2 pr 2 r 0 1 sq because of the difficulty to prove an exponentially weighted estimate as usual in this context we reduce ourselves into proving an estimate for the conjugated operator e px y tqpbt b 3 x b 3 yqe px y tq the main point in the proof is roughly speaking a positive commutator argument that will give a lower bound for the conjugated operator e pbt b 3 x b 3 yqe once it is decomposed as a sum of its symmetric and skew symmetric part in order to do that we define f e px y tqg observe that

1 r 3 the ratios 3 2 r 2 and then 5 2 r 2 on the left hand side grow as a positive fractional power of r therefore being the last two terms on the right hand side finite because of the strong assumption about g these can be absorbed on the left hand side assuming r to be sufficiently large this yields the desired result remark 2 3 notice that our hypothesis 2 m 1 r 3 turns out to be fundamental to make the term 3 2 r 2 growing as a positive fractional power of r in order to absorb e g l 2 in the left hand side of 25 and obtain 24 we recall that the term e g l 2 comes from the fact that we want to obtain a carleman estimate for the operator p bt b 3 x b 3 y a 1 pbx byq a 0 which involves first order derivatives if instead we consider an operator of this form bt b 3 x b 3 y apx y tq namely an operator in which the first derivatives do not appear it would be sufficient to assume 4 m 1 r 5 in order to guarantee that 5 2 r 3 grows as a fractional power of r and hence to get from estimate 18 a carleman estimate for this operator in particular this means that the form of the operator plays the fundamental role in the choice of the decay necessary in order to obtain a unique continuation result to be more precise considering the differential equation btu b 3 xu b 3 yu apx y tqu 0 in this case it would be sufficient to require weaker hypothesis about the decay of the solution than the ones in theorem 1 3 namely u 1 p 0 q u 2 p 0 q u 1 p 1 q u 2 p 1 q p l 2 pea x y 5 4 dx dyq several evidences of the strict link between the decay assumption necessary to get unique continuation results and the form of the operator one is dealing with can be found in literature in 6 liana dawson proved the following result concerning with unique continuation for equations in the kdv hierarchy theorem 2 2 let u 1 u 2 two sufficiently smooth solutions of btu b 5 xu 10 ub 3 xu 20 bxub 2 xu 30 u 2 bxu 0 px tq p r r 0 1 s if there exists an 0 such that u 1 p 0 q u 2 p 0 q u

btv b 5 xv a 4 px tqb 4 xv a 3 px tqb 3 xv a 2 px tqb 2 xv a 1 px tqbxv a 0 px tqv 0 or better since it is always possible to eliminate the fourth order term by considering wpx tq upx yqe 15 x 0 a 4

for the leading order terms of the operator namely bt b 5 x was shown 1 2 r e x r ptq 2 b 4 xg l 2 3 2 r 2 e x r ptq 2 x r ptq b 3 xg l 2 5 2 r 3 e x r ptq 2 x r ptq 2 b 2 xg l 2 7 2 r 4 e x r ptq 2 x

that is bt b 5 x a 3 b 3 x a 2 b 2 x a 1 bx a 0 an adding and subtracting argument is performed to let this argument work we need to choose in such a way the ratios 3 2 r 2 5 2 r 3 7 2 r 4 9 2 r 5 grow as fractional powers of r because therefore for r sufficiently large the additional terms on the right hand side can be absorbed in the left hand side this entails the restriction 3 m 1 r 4 about which leads to the exponential decay rate in theorem 2 2 let us observe that also in this fifth order setting if one considered a differential equation in which third and fourth derivatives do not appear namely btv b 5 xv a 2 px tqb 2 xv a 1 px tqbxv a 0 px tqv 0 27 in this case we just need to guarantee that 5 2 r 3 7 2 r 4 9 2 r 5 grow as a fractional positive power of r that holds true assuming 4 m 1 r 5 this means that in this situation a stronger unique continuation result could be achieved requiring a weaker decay rate for the solutions at two distinct times in 21 it was proved that this fact holds for a quite general class of high order equations of kdv type which includes the kdv hierarchy precisely that work is concerned with unique continuation results for the equation btv p 1 qk 1 bnxv p pv bxv bpxvq 0 px tq p r r 0 1 s 28 where n 2 k 1 k 1 2 and p is a polynomial in v bxv bpxv with p n 1 of particular interest in that work were the cases p n 2 and p k with n 5 for these situations it was proved that if the difference of two sufficiently smooth solutions of the equation 28 with p n 2 decays as e x 4 3 at two distinct times then u 1 u 2 moreover when p k a similar result was obtained assuming the weaker decay e ax n n 1 for a 0 sufficiently large now we are in position to prove the lower bound proof of theorem 2 1 the starting point in the proof of the lower bound is to apply estimate 24 in lemma 2 4 to a particular function g that we shall define to be suitably related with the solution v of 16 in order to do that for r 2 we introduce the function r p c 8 pr 2 q so defined rpx yq 1 if x y r 1 x y r 1 0 if x y r x y r p c 8 pr 2 q such that px yq 0 if a x 2 y 2 1 1 if a x 2 y 2 2 and r r 0 2 2 s p c 80 prq with ptq 0 if t p 0 r 2 y 1 r 2 1 2 2 if t p rr 1 rs increasing in r r 2 rs and decreasing in r 1 r 1 r 2 s unique continuation for z k equation 13 we define the auxiliary function gpx y tq rpx yq x r ptq y r ptq vpx y tq px yq p r 2 t p

observe that since in the first term in the right hand side of the previous equation the derivatives of r appear this term is supported in tpx yq r 1 x y r r 1 x y ru r 0 1 s so in particular px yq is such that a x 2 y 2 r and this entails r ptq 5 moreover one can notice that all the remaining terms sorted with respect to their dependence on the derivatives of our solution v contain the derivatives of this means that they are supported in tpx y tq 1 r ptq 2 t p r 0 1 su next we verify that function g defined above satisfies the hypotheses of lemma 2 4 indeed if x y r x y r then we fall outside the support of r this means that gpx y tq 0 if x y r x y r and t p r 0 r 2 s y r 1 r 2 1 s then gpx y tq 0 indeed being x y r x y r in particular a x 2 y 2 r and since ptq 0 if t p r 0 r 2 s y r 1 r 2 1 s this gives r ptq 1 therefore we are out of the support of x r ptq y r ptq and so gpx y tq 0 this guarantees that g is compactly supported now we observe that g is supported in tpx y tq p r 2 r 0 1 s r ptq 1 u indeed if r ptq 1 then x r ptq y r ptq 0 and so gpx y tq 0 since g satisfies the hypotheses of lemma 2 4 there exist c 0 r 0 and m 1 such that c 5 2 r 3 e g l 2 pr 2 r 0 1 sq e pbt b 3 x b

e 4 a 30 we observe that in the region q tpx y tq a x 2 y 2 1 t p rr 1 rsu we have gpx y tq vpx y tq indeed if a x 2 y 2 1 in particular a x 2 y 2 r 1 therefore rpx yq 1 moreover in q it also holds that x r ptq y r ptq 1 indeed using that ptq 2 2 in rr 1 rs the trivial inequality a b 2 a 2 b 2 which holds for all a b 0 and the assumption r 2 we have r 2 2 2 16 x 2 y 2 r 2 4 2 r px yq 16 4 2 r p x y q 16 8 r a x 2 y 2 12 then r ptq 12 2 and so x r ptq y r ptq 1 using that g v in q we obtain the following chain of inequalities c 5 2 r 3 e g l 2 pr 2 r 0 1 sq c 5 2 r 3 e g l 2 pqq c 5 2 r 3 e v

previous inequality can be absorbed by the term on the left hand side so we can conclude that there exists rr 0 0 such that for r rr 0 the following holds arpvq c 2 e 21 m 1 2 1 r 3 2 this yields the desired result 2 2 upper bound now we will turn on the proof of the upper bound for solutions of 16 precisely the result we will prove is the following theorem 2 3 assume that the coefficients in 16 a 0 a 1 satisfy a 0 p l 8 x l 2 xl 8 yt and a 1 p l 2 xl 8 yt x l 1 xl 8 yt if v p cpr 0 1 s h 4 pr 2 qq is a solution of 16 satisfying that vp 0 q vp 1 q p l 2 pea x y 3 2 dx dyq for some a 0 then there exist c and r 0 0 sufficiently large such that for r r 0 v l 2 pqr r 0 1 sq 0 k l 2 bkxblyv l 2 pqr r 0 1 sq ce ap r 18 q 3 2 where qr tpx yq r 1 x y r r 1 x y ru as in 4 we shall prove first the following lemma whose proof can be found in the appendix lemma 2 5 let w p cpr 0 1 s h 4 pr 2 qq xc 1 pr 0 1 s l 2 pr 2 qq such that for all t p r 0 1 s suppwptq k where k is a compact subset of r 2 assume that a 0 p l 8 x l 2 xl 8 yt and a 1 p l 2 xl 8 yt x l 1 xl 8 yt with small norms in these spaces then there exists c 0 independent of the set k such that for 1 the following estimate holds e

yq remark 2 5 although we have assumed wptq to be compactly supported for all t p r 0 1 s we shall see that the argument in lemma 2 5 can be extended to a larger class of functions indeed we only have to ensure that the following quantity e x y w l 2 0 k l 2 e x y bkxblyw l 8 x l 2 yt is finite unique continuation for z k equation 15 to justify this affirmation we need to anticipate few facts regarding the proof of lemma 2 5 that can be found in the appendix below just to convey the idea we introduce the following notation similar to that one already used by escauriaza kenig ponce and vega in 9 h 1 e x y h l 2 pr 2 r 0 1 sq 0 k l 2 e x y bkxblyh l 8 x l 2 ytpr 2 r 0 1 sq h 2 h l 1 tl 2 xyxl 1 xl 2 ytpr 2 r 0 1 sq as customary we will start proving the estimate involving just the leading part of the operator we are working with namely h bt b 3 x b 3 y then we extended our a priori estimate to the whole operator that is ha bt b 3 x b 3 y a 1 pbx byq a 0 using an adding and subtracting argument more precisely using our new notation the starting estimate for the leading operator h can be written as w 1 c 2 j 3 pe x y wp 0 qq l 2 pr 2 q j 3 pe x y wp 1 qq l 2 pr 2 q e x y hw 2 now the second step we follow is to extend this inequality to the operator ha using the h lder inequality and the smallness assumptions about a 0 and a 1 we get w 1 c 2 j 3 pe x y wp 0 qq l 2 pr 2 q j 3 pe x y wp 1 qq l 2 pr 2 q e x y hw 2 c 2 j 3 pe x y wp 0 qq l 2 pr 2 q j 3 pe x y wp 1 qq l 2 pr 2 q e x y haw 2 e x y a 1 pbx byq a 0 w 2 c 2 j 3 pe x y wp 0 qq l 2 pr 2 q j 3 pe x y wp 1 qq l 2 pr 2 q e

working on a class of solutions w wpx y tq for which w 1 is finite for all 0 we can obtain the desired result that is the extended a priori estimate w 1 c 2 j 3 pe x y wp 0 qq l 2 pr 2 q j 3 pe x y wp 1 qq l 2 pr 2 q c e x y haw 2 now it should appear clear that in order to obtain the result in lemma 2 5 the hypothesis wptq to be compactly supported is overabundant it is sufficient to produce solutions for which w 1 is finite in order to ensure the finiteness of w 1 it is sufficient to prove that a so called persistence property for the solution flow to 12 holds true more precisely it is sufficient to prove that if a solution to 12 has a suitable exponential decay at two different instant of time namely t 1 0 and t 2 1 then this decay rate is preserved for all t p r 0 1 s the proof of this property and thus of the finiteness of the w 1 can be found in appendix b theorem b 1 now we are in position to prove the upper estimate in theorem 2 3 proof of theorem 2 3 we construct a c 8 truncation function r with rpx yq 0 if x y r and rpx yq 1 if x y 18 r 14 let us define wpx y tq rpx yqvpx y tq now we want to see what kind of equation is satisfied by w it is easy to see that since v is a solution of 16 the following holds bt b 3 x b 3 y a 1 px y tqpbx byq a 0 px y tq w erpx y tq 16 lucrezia cossetti luca fanelli and felipe linares where erpx y tq b 3 x rv 3 b 2 x rbxv 3 bx rb 2 xv b 3 y rv 3 b 2 y rbyv 3 by rb 2 yv a 1 px y tqbx rv a 1 px y tqby rv this means that our function w solves an equation like 16 but with a correction term er next step would be apply lemma 2 5 to function w to do so we first need a 0 a 1 to have small norms therefore we introduce r such that r rpx yq rpx yq and raj ajpx y tqr r with j 0 1 have small norms in the corresponding spaces for r r 0 let us consider the operator rl bt b 3 x b 3 y ra 1 pbx byq ra 0 32 now we are in position to apply 2 5 with the operator rl this gives e x y w l 2 0 k l 2 e x y bkxblyw l 8 x l 2 yt c 2 j 3 pe x y wp

consider the term c 2 j 3 pe x y wp 0 qq l 2 since w is supported in the set tpx y tq x y r t p r 0 1 su and using that the r and its derivatives are bounded by a constant independent of r it follows c 2 j 3 pe x y wp 0 qq l 2 c 5 0 k l 3 e x y bkxblywp 0 q l 2 c 5 0 k l 3 e x y bkxblywp 0 q l 2 p x y r c 5 0 k l 3 e x y bkxblyvp 0 q l 2 x y r now we want to choose in such a way to obtain in the right hand side of the previous estimate the weighted norm of vp 0 q with the right exponential weight let 2 ar 3 2 18 r 1 using the explicit expression of it can be seen that for r sufficiently large depending on a one has 5 e x y 2 ar 3 2 18 r 1 5 e 2 ar 3 2 18 r 1 x y cae a 8 x y 3 2 for x y r using the previous estimate one has c 2 j 3 pe x y wp 0 qq l 2 ca 0 k l 3 e a 8 x y 3 2 bkxblyvp 0 q l

finiteness of 34 it can be seen that e a 8 x y 3 2 bkxblyvp 0 q l 2 is finite to show this we will employ the following interpolation result lemma 2 6 for s 0 and a 0 let f p hspr 2 q x l 2 ea x y 3 2

and vptq p c r 0 1 s h 4 pr 2 q hence lemma 2 6 with s 4 and 1 4 ensures that e a 8 x y 3 2 bkxblyvp 0 q l 2 is finite using this fact we obtain c 2 j 3 pe x y wp 0 qq l 2 ca 35 a similar argument shows that c 2 j 3 pe x y wp 1 qq l 2 ca 36 it remains to bound the third term in the right hand side of 33 since er is supported in r tpx y tq r x y 18 r 14 t p r 0 1 su we find that e x y er l 1 tl

defining dr t 18 r 1 x y 18 r 18 r 1 x y 18 ru see that dr r 0 1 s t x y ru r 0 1 s the set in which w is supported observing that in dr r 0 1 s we have w v one obtains e x y v l 2 pdr r 0 1 sq 0 k l

r 1 4 ep 1 q 18 r 1 4 e p 1 1 q 18 r 1 4 e 2 18 r 1 4 ear 3 2 this implies that e 2 ar 3 2 v l 2 pdr r 0 1 sq 0 k l 2 bkxblyv l 2 pdr r 0 1 sq caear 3 2 which is equivalent to v l 2 pdr r 0 1 sq 0 k l

proofs as it was commented in the introduction theorem 1 3 will follow as a consequence of theorem 1 4 therefore we first provide the proof of theorem 1 4 18 lucrezia cossetti luca fanelli and felipe linares 2 3 1 proof of theorem 1 4 if v 0 we can assume after a possible translation dilation and multiplication by a constant that v satisfies the hypotheses of theorem 2 1 this means that for r sufficiently large there exist constants c 0 and c 1 as given in theorem 2 1 such that arpvq c 0 e c 1 r 3 2 38 where arpvq qr r 0 1 s v 2 v 2 v 2 dx dy dt 1 2 and qr tpx yq r 1 x y r r 1 x y ru applying theorem 2 3 we can conclude that v l 2 pqr r 0 1 sq 0 k l 2 bkxblyv l 2 pqr r 0 1 sq ce a r 18 3 2 it is easy to see that the left hand side of the previous expression can be bounded from below by the quantity arpvq this gives arpvq ce a 18 3 2 r 3 2 39 if one assumes a a 0 183 2 c 1 combining 38 and 39 and taking the limit as r tends to infinity we get a contradiction therefore v 0 and theorem 1 4 is proved 2 3 2 proof of theorem 1 3 we just need to show that theorem 1 4 applies when we consider v as the difference u 1 u 2 of two solutions to 12 first of all we have already shown that if u 1 and u 2 are solutions to 12 then the difference v satisfies btv pb 3 x b 3 yqv a 1 pbx byqv a 0 v 0 where a 0 4 1 3 pbx byqu 2 and a 1 4 1 3 u 1 40 thus one just needs to check that the coefficients a 0 a 1 as defined above satisfy the assumptions of theorem 1 4 that is a 0 p l 8 x l 2 xl 8 y t a 1 p l 8 x l 2 xl 8 yt x l 1 xl 8 yt 41 to do that proceeding as in 4 we will use the following interpolation result see 34 lemma 2 7 for s 0 and a 0 let f p hspr 2 q x l 2 pp 1 x y q 2 a dxdyq then for any p p 0 1 q j s p 1 x y qp 1 qaf l 2 c jsf l 2 p 1 x y qaf 1 l 2 42 for c cpa sq applying 42 with s 4 a 4 3 and 1 4 3 16 with as in the statement of theorem 1 3 we have j 1 3 4 p 1 x y qp 1 1 qf l 2 c j 4 f l 2 p 1 x y qp 4 3 qf 1 l 2 43 where 1 2 3 16 2 0 applying 43 with f a 1 4 1 3 u 1 ptq from our hypothesis about the solution u 1 and from the embedding h 1 3 4 pr 2 q l 8 pr 2 q x cpr 2 q we obtain u 1 px y tq c p 1 x y qp 1 1 q 44 for all px y tq p r 2 r 0 1 s since 1 3 4 1 the estimate 43 is also true for j 1 instead of j 1 34 with f 4 12 u 2 using the product rule for the derivatives we obtain that p 1 x y qp 1 1 q 4 13 bxu 2 ptq l 2 pr 2 q and p 1 x y qp 1 1 q 4 1 3 byu 2 ptq l 2 pr 2 q unique continuation for z k equation 19 are bounded function of t p r 0 1 s this allows us to apply 42 with f 4 13 bxu 2 ptq and f 4 1 3 byu 2 ptq s 3 a 1 1 and 13 2 with 2 0 small to obtain j 1 3 2 p 1 x y q 23 4 13 bxu 2 ptq l 2 c j 3 p 4 13 bxu 2 ptqq l 2 p 1 x y q p 1 1 q 4 1 3 bxu 2 ptq 1 l 2 and the same for the derivative with respect to y using this estimate and again the sobolev embeddings one has 4 1 3 pbx byqu 2 ptq c p 1 x y q 23 45 for all px y tq p r 2 r 0 1 s from the decay properties expressed in 44 and 45 it is clear that hypothesis 41 holds remark 2 7 as a final remark we observe that from 44 and 45 the functions raj ajpx y tqr r with j 0 1 and ajpx y tq as in 40 have small norms in the corresponding spaces for r sufficiently large as required in theorem 2 3 indeed choosing r r in theorem 2 3 as r rpx yq tpx yq x y rupx yq with the indicator function of the set it is easy to see from 44 and 45 that the following four terms a 0 tpx yq x y ru l 8 xl 2 xl 8 yt a 1 tpx yq x y ru l 2 xl 8 ytxl 1 xl 8 yt tend to zero as r tends to infinity this guarantees the smallness required 3 proof of theorem 1 2 as a starting point we recall that if uj ujpx y tq j 0 1 is a solution to 1 then ruj rujpx 1 y 1 tq uj x 1 y 1 2 x 1 y 1 2 t j 0 1 satisfies the symmetric problem 12 in particular this entails that if one provides uniqueness for solutions to 12 namely ru 1 ru 2 then uniqueness for solutions to 1 namely u 1 u 2 is also given thus in order to get our result one just needs to show that if uj j 0 1 satisfies the hypotheses in theorem 1 2 then theorem 1 3 applies to ruj j 0 1 using 11 by elementary change of integration variables it can be seen that for j 0 1 u 1 ptjq u 2 ptjq 2 l 2 pea x 3 2 dxdyq r 2 ea x 3 2 pu 1 ptjq u 2 ptjqq 2 dx dy 1

identity it follows that if u 1 u 2 satisfies the decay assumption 10 then ru 1 p 0 q ru 2 p 0 q ru 1 p 1 q ru 2 p 1 q p l 2 e ra x y 3 2 dxdy with ra a p 2 q 3 2 therefore by theorem 1 3 we conclude that there exists a universal constant a 0 such that if ra a 0 that is if a p 2 q 3 2 a 0 then ru 1 ru 2 in particular this implies u 1 u 2 which is the desired result 20 lucrezia cossetti luca

part of the operator p namely bt b 3 x b 3 y lemma a 2 let w p cpr 0 1 s h 4 pr 2 qq x c 1 pr 0 1 s l 2 pr 2 qq such that for all t p r 0 1 s suppwptq k where k is a compact subset of r 2 then 1 for 0

from 58 and 59 the estimate in lemma a 1 for the whole operator p the coefficient in front of the term on the right hand side of 59 involving the operator bt b 3 x b 3 y does not depend on and indeed otherwise since and grow as r the correction terms coming from the addition of the lower order derivatives cannot be hidden in the left hand side as desired before proving lemma a 2 we introduce the following notations h e xe ypbt b 3 x b 3 yqe xe y bt pbx q 3 pby q 3 60 it is easy to see from the previous definition that h is defined through the space time fourier transform by the multiplier i pi q 3 pi q 3 we can define the inverse operator t 0 of h by the symbol m 0 p q 1 i pi q 3 pi q 3 61 this means that yt 0 h m 0 p qph where in order to simplify the notation we use p to denote the fourier transform in s 1 pr 3 q the proof of lemma a 2 is based on two previous lemmas these lemmas express respectively the boundedness of the operator t 0 and pbx qkpby qlt 0 where k l are non negative integers with 0 k l 2 actually we need just the decoupled options that is pk lq p 0 0 q p 1 0 q p 0 1 q p 2 0 q and p 0 2 q lemma a 3 let h p l 1 pr 3 q with h l 1 tl 2 xy pr 3 q 8 then for

xypr 3 q t p r proof first of all we want to write the symbol m 0 p q in a more useful way precisely it is not difficult to see that the following holds m 0 p q i ap q ibp q where ap q 3 3 2 3 3 2 and bp q 3 3 2 3 3 2 before going any further we want to recall some useful properties of the fourier transform unique continuation for z k equation 25 remark a 3 our definition for the 1 dimensional fourier transform is pfp q 1 2 r e i tfptq dt 63 making a straightforward computation it is not difficult to see that defining gp q i ib b 0 the inverse fourier transform of g has this form qgptq 2 p

and the property that the translation in the moment space is a multiplication by a phase factor in the position space and vice versa in other words qgp aqptq e itaqgptq one has qgptq 2 p 0 8 qptqetbe ita b 0 2 p 8 0 qptqetbe ita b 0 with the previous remark in mind we can say that for a fixed pair p q with bp q 0 and t p r we have rm 0 p qsq ptq 2 p 0 8 qptqetbp qe itap q bp q 0 2 p 8 0 qptqetbp qe itap q bp q 0 clearly the magnitude of the right hand side is bounded by 2 now we need to compute the quantity m 0 p qphp q q ptq in order to do that we recall that under our definition of the fourier transform 63 and its inverse the following property holds fgptq qfptq qgptq 2 moreover using that ph hpxyp one easily obtains m 0 p qphp q q ptq rm 0 p qsq ptq hp x y tqpxyp q 2 1 2 rs rm 0 p

consider the case k 2 and l 0 since the proofs of other cases are similar for brevity we will omit them first of all let us note that m 2 0 p q ip i q 2 rp i q 3 p i q 3 s defining v i and w i we can re write the preceding as m 2 0 p q iv 2 v 3 w 3 the polynomial p pvq v 3 w 3 has got as a multiple root just v 0 but since under our hypothesis v is always different from zero we can assume p pvq not to have multiple roots this allows us to use the following decomposition in partial fractions m 2 0 3 j 1 iv 2 j 3 pv vjqv 2 j 3 j 1 i 3 p pvjq ir pvjqsq 1 3 3 j 1 i ajp q ibjp q where vj j 1 2 3 are the different roots of p ajp q pvjq and bjp q pvjq moving on as in lemma a 3 that is using the remark a 3 for a fixed pair p q such that bp q 0 making use of the linearity of the inverse fourier

result in 4 we will provide it for sake of completeness proof of lemma a 2 the proof of estimate 58 follows from lemma a 3 and the proof of 59 follows from lemma a 4 we only prove the estimate 59 for

ptq ptqwptq unique continuation for z k equation 27 where with an abuse of notation w represents the extension of w which is identically zero outside r 0 1 s we define h e xe ypbt b 3 x b 3 yqw then more explicitly h 1 e xe yw h 0 65 where h 0 e xe ypbt b 3 x b 3 yqw it is not difficult to see that h can be re written as h re xe ypbt b 3 x b 3 yqe xe yse xe yw h pe xe yw q this means that e xe yw

using the hypotheses of lemma a 2 we can apply lemma a 4 to h 0 this gives rm 2 0 xh 0 sq l 8 x l 2 yt h 0 l 1 xl 2 yt 67 now we need to provide an estimate for the first term on the right hand side

assuming wptq to be compactly supported without loss of generality we may suppose suppwptq r m m s r m m s for all t p r 0 1 s making use of the fact that b 2 xwptq p h 2 pr 2 q l 8 pr 2 q we get e xe

unique continuation for z k equation 29 in order to conclude the proof we need the following remark an equivalent way to write the estimate 59 is the following ej xek yb 2 xw l 8 x l 2 yt cp 2 2 q j 3

other cases follow in a similar way and so omit them the first step we have to perform is to modify the definition of the multipliers m 0 and mk l considering instead of pi q and pi q the other three possible pairs pi q and pi q if we want to estimate e xe ylw l 8 x l 2 yt pi q and pi q if we want to estimate e xe ylw l 8 x l 2 yt pi q and pi q for the estimate of e xe ylw l 8 x l 2 yt since in order to prove 70 we strongly used the estimates in lemma a 3 and a 4 we would like them to hold also for the modified versions of m 0 and mk l written above but one can easily see that this is true just revisiting the proof of the two lemmas with the new definitions of m 0 and mk l this concludes the proof of our lemma now we shall extend the result in lemma a 2 to operators as in 17 namely we prove lemma a 1 proof of lemma a 1 from lemma a 2 and using the fact that l 2 pr 2 r 0 1 sq l 8 t l 2 xypr 2 r 0 1 sq it follows that e x e y w l 2 e x e y wp 0 q l 2 e x e y wp 1 q l 2 e x e y pbt b

persistence properties in this section we are interested in studying persistence properties for solutions to 12 in general a persistence property in a function space x means that the solution t uptq describes a continuous curve on x that is u p cpr 0 1 s xq the theorem we are going to prove can be seen as a two dimensional generalization of the very well known result by kato 23 for the kdv equation theorem b 1 let u p cpr 0 1 s h 4 pr 2 qq x c 1 pr 0 1 s l 2 pr 2 qq be a solution of the equation 12 i if for all 0 up 0 q p l 2 pe 2 px yqdx dyq then u is a bounded function from r 0 1 s with values in h 3 pe 2 px yqdx dyq for all 0 ii if for all 0 up 1 q p l 2 pe 2 px yq dxdyq then u is a bounded function from r 0 1 s with values in h 3 pe 2 px yqdx dyq for all 0 in particular if the conditions for up 0 q and up 1 q given in piq and piiq respectively are satisfied then u is bounded from r 0 1 s to h 3 pe 2 x y dx dyq the proof of theorem b 1 is based on the following lemmas the first lemma is an interpolation result that can be proved using the three line theorem lemma b 1 for s 0 and 0 let f p hspr 2 q x l 2 pe 2 px yq dxdyq then for p r 0 1 s j spep 1 q px yqfq l 2 pr 2 q c j sf l 2 pr 2 q e px yqf 1 l 2 pr 2 q where js is such that yjsgp q p 1 2 2 q s 2 pgp q in order to prove the exponential decay in theorem b 1 we proceed in two steps firstly we prove that u is a bounded function from r 0 1 s with values in l 2 pe 2 px yqdx dyq then using the interpolation result lemma b 1 we obtain the boundedness of uptq in the space h 3 pe 2 px yqdx dyq the conclusion then follows from the symmetry properties of the equation the following lemma shows the boundedness of uptq in the space l 2 pe 2 px yqdx dyq the proof of this result follows mainly a strategy used in 3 that came to light in the seminal paper by kato 23 treating the well posedness of the cauchy problem for the kdv equation lemma b 2 let u p cpr 0 1 s h 4 pr 2 qq x c 1 pr 0 1 s l 2 pr 2 qq be a solution of the equation 12 such that for all 0 up 0 q p l 2 pe 2 px yqdx dyq then u is a bounded function from r 0 1 s with values in l 2 pe 2 px yqdx dyq for all 0 unique continuation for z k equation 31 proof since e 2 px yq is a highly unbounded weight function it is difficult to prove the result directly therefore we first approximate e 2 px yq by a bounded weight function npx yq which tends to e 2 px yq monotonically as n goes to infinity let p c 8 prq be a decreasing function with pxq 1 if x 1 and pxq 0 if x 10 and let npxq x 0 x 1 n dx 1 for n p n we define npx yq e 2 npx yq it can be seen that for every n npx yq e 2 px yq if x y n and npx yq dn e 20 n if x y 10 n moreover n n 1 and bjx npx yq cj npx yq bjy npx yq cj npx yq j p n px yq p r 2 multiplying the equation 12 by u n and integrating the resulting identity we obtain r 2 btu u n r 2 b 3 xu u n r 2 b 3 yu u n 4 1 3 r 2 u 2 bxu n 4 1 3 r 2 u 2 byu n 0 integrating by parts one has 1 2 d dt r 2 u 2 n 1 2 r 2 u 2 b 3 x

y n 4 1 3 3 r 2 u 3 bx n 4 1 3 3 r 2 u 3 by n using the properties for the derivatives of n and sobolev embeddings one gets 1 2 d dt r 2 u 2 n c 3 r 2 u 2 n 2 4 1 3 3 uptq l 8 c 1 r 2 u 2 n c 3 c u cpr 0 1 s h 2 pr 2 qq r 2 u 2 n c u r 2 u 2 n applying the gronwall lemma we obtain r 2 u 2 ptq n ec ut r 2 u 2 p 0 q n ec u r 2 u 2 p 0 q n t p r 0 1 s using the monotone convergence theorem letting n go to infinity we can conclude that r 2 u 2 ptqe 2 px yq dx dy c r 2 u 2 p 0 qe 2 px yq dx dy t p r 0 1 s this proves that uptq is a bounded function from r 0 1 s with values in l 2 pe 2 px yqdx dyq for all 0 proof of theorem b 1 i we want to prove that assuming up 0 q p l 2 pe 2 px yqdx dyq we have that t uptq is bounded from r 0 1 s with values in h 3 pe 2 px yqdx dyq in lemma b 2 we have already proved that if up 0 q p l 2 pe 2 px yqdx dyq then u is a bounded function from r 0 1 s with values in l 2 pe 2 px yqdx dyq moreover since we are assuming u p cpr 0 1 s h 4 pr 2 qq we can use the interpolation result lemma b 1 with s 4 and 3 2 to obtain j 3 pe 4 px yquptqq l 2 pr 2 q c j 4 uptq l 2 pr 2 q e px yquptq 1 l 2 pr 2 q since we are assuming the previous to hold for all 0 we can re define in such a way to be able to conclude that t uptq is bounded from r 0 1 s with values in h 3 pe 2 px yqdx dyq 32 lucrezia cossetti luca fanelli and felipe linares ii this property follows immediately from piq taking into account the symmetry properties of equation 12 indeed it can be seen that the function defined as rupx y tq up x y 1 tq is still a solution of 12 moreover since we are assuming up 1 q p l 2 pe 2 px yqdx dyq the function ru satisfies the hypothesis of piq therefore ru is bounded from r 0 1 s with values in h 3 pe 2 px yqdx dyq for all 0 or what is equivalent u is bounded from r 0 1 s with values in h 3 pe 2 px yqdx dyq which is the proof of piiq references 1 j bourgain on the compactness of the support of solutions of dispersive equations int math res not 9
