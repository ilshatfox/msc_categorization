painleve o d e y xy 2 y 3 0 x r is known to play an important role in the theory of integrable systems random matrices bose einstein condensates and other problems the generalized second painleve equation y x 1 y 2 y 3 0 x 1 x 2 r 2 is obtained by multiplying by x 1 the linear term u of the allen cahn equation u u 3 u it involves a non autonomous potential h x 1 y which is bistable for every fixed x 1 0 and thus describes as the allen cahn equation a phase transition model the scope of this paper is to construct a solution y connecting along the vertical direction x 2 the two branches of minima of h parametrized by x 1 this solution plays a similar role that the heteroclinic orbit for the allen cahn equation it is the the first to our knowledge solution of the painleve p d e both relevant from the applications point of view liquid crystals and mathematically interesting 1 the allen cahn and painleve phase transition models a standard phase transition model is given by the allen cahn o d e 1 1 u u 3 u in r that can alternatively be written u w u where w u 1 4 u 2 1 2 is a double well potential in this model u describes the mass fraction of the two phases of a substance e g an alloy and takes values approximately 1 or 1 for the pure phases equation 1 1 has variational structure let eac u a b b a 1 2 u 2 1 4 u 2 1 2 be the allen cahn energy associated to 1 1 to minimize eac the right balance between the contributions of the kinetic energy 1 2 u 2 and the potential should be achieved on the one hand the term 1 2 u 2 penalizes high variations of u while on the other hand the potential term w forces the minimizer to be close to its global minima 1 it is clear that the trivial solutions 1 are the two global minimizers of eac thus it is more relevant to investigate instead the existence of local minimizers which are also called minimal solutions while solutions of 1 1 are critical points of eac a minimal solution u of 1 1 satisfies the stronger condition eac u supp eac u supp for all c 0 r i e any perturbation with compact support of u has greater or equal energy it turns out that up to translations and change of x by x the only minimal solution of 1 1 is the heteroclinic orbit x tanh x 2 connecting at the two phases 1 a much more challenging problem is the description of all bounded solutions of the allen cahn p d e 1 2 u u 3 u in rn which is associated to the functional eac u 1 2 u 2 1 4 u 2 1 2 where rn is bounded de giorgi in 1978 17 suggested a striking analogy with minimal surface theory that led to significant developments in p d e and the calculus of variations by stating the following conjecture about bounded solutions on rn conjecture de giorgi let u c 2 rn be a solution to 1 2 such that i u 1 ii u xn 0 for all x rn is it true that all the level sets of u are hyperplanes at least for n 8 1991 mathematics subject classification primary 35 j 91 35 j 20 secondary 35 b 40 35 b 06 35 b 25 1 http arxiv org abs 1807 05580 v 2 the relationship with the bernstein problem for minimal graphs is the reason why n 8 appears in the conjecture we refer to the expository papers of farina and valdinoci 18 and savin 28 for a detailed account the conjecture was proved by ghoussoub and gui in 19 for n 2 for n 3 by ambrosio and cabre in 7 and for 4 n 8 by savin in 27 under the extra requirement that 1 3 lim xn u x 1 xn 1 if we drop the monotonicity requirement as well as 1 3 and simply ask about the structure of minimal solutions 1 of 1 2 then we know from 27 that for n 7 any minimal solution u of 1 2 is either trivial i e u 1 or one dimensional i e u x x x 0 for some x 0 rn and some unit vector rn thus the heteroclinic orbit of o d e 1 1 plays a crucial role for entire solutions of p d e 1 2 in order to construct other connecting solutions of 1 2 one shall impose some additional requirements for instance when n 2 1 2 admits a unique saddle solution u cf 16 satisfying the following properties u x 1 x 2 has the same sign as the product x 1 x 2 u is odd with respect to x 1 and x 2 limx 1 u x 1 x 2 x 2 and ux 1 x 1 x 2 0 x 2 0 lim u cos sin 1 0 2 this example also outlines the hierarchical structure of 1 2 since by taking the limit of a solution along certain directions at infinity lower dimensional solutions are obtained cf 6 chapter 8 for more examples of connecting maps under symmetry assumptions or in the vector case we refer to 6 chapters 6 7 9 and the references therein in particular 4 and 29 the second painleve o d e 1 4 y xy 2 y 3 0 x r is basically obtained by multiplying the linear term in the right hand side of 1 1 by x alternatively we can write 1 4 as 1 5 y hy x y x r with h x y 1 2 xy 2 1 2 y 4 in contrast with w defined below 1 1 the potential h is non autonomous i e it depends both on x and y equation 1 4 is known to play an important role in the theory of integrable systems 1 random matrices 15 20 11 bose einstein condensates 2 3 24 30 and other problems 5 23 25 recently 12 it has been shown that when the right hand side of 1 4 is allowed to be a constant r then it describes local profiles of the so called shadow kink in the theory of light matter interaction of nematic liquid crystals cf also 32 31 in 8 13 14 further relation between other types of non topological defects shadow vortices shadow domain walls and the generalized painleve equation 1 6 y x 1 y 2 y 3 0 x x 1 x 2 r 2 was established showing that their local structure is determined by special solutions of 1 6 one of the characteristics of these solutions is that they should be entire another is that they should be minimal to explain what this means let r 2 be a bounded subset of r 2 and epii u 1 2 u 2 1 2 x 1 u 2 1 2 u 4 be the functional associated to the generalized second painleve equation by definition a solution of 1 6 is minimal if 1 7 epii y supp epii y supp for all c 0 r 2 this notion of minimality is standard for many problems in which the energy of a localized solution is actually infinite due to non compactness of the domain the study of minimal solutions of 1 4 has been recently initiated in 12 where we have showed that the hastings mcleod solution denoted 1 again we say that the solution u is minimal if eac u supp eac u supp for all c 0 rn 2 in this paper by h is up to the sign change the only minimal solution which is bounded at we recall cf 22 that h r r is positive strictly decreasing h 0 and such that h x ai x x h x x 2 x 1 8 clearly the asympotic behaviour of h is determined by the location of the global minima of the potential h x y associated to the equation 1 4 indeed for x fixed h attains its global minimum equal to 0 when y 0 and x 0 and equal to x 2 8 when y x 2 and x 0 thus the global minima of h bifurcate from the origin and the two minimal solutions h of 1 4 interpolate these two branches of minima equation 1 6 or equivalently y hy x 1 y with x x 1 x 2 r 2 and h x 1 y 12 x 1 y 2 1 2 y 4 cf the expression of epii involves a non autonomous potential which is bistable for every fixed x 1 0 hence the painleve generalized equation 1 6 describes as the allen cahn equation a phase transition model for the later the phase transition connects the two minima 1 while for the former the phase transition connects the two branches x 1 2 of minima of h parametrized by x 1 note that in the painleve model the phase transition occurs only in the p d e case i e when the domain is rn 1 r rn with n 1 the scope of this paper is to construct a solution y of 1 6 connecting as x 2 and x 1 is fixed the two branches of minima of h cf theorem 1 1 below it is the first to our knowledge example of solution of the generalized painleve equation both relevant from the applications point of view and mathematically interesting the solution y has similar properties as the heteroclinic orbit it is odd and monotonous with respect to x 2 and as x 1 its rescaled profile is actually given by after the statement of theorem 1 1 we will further discuss its similarities with the heteroclinic orbit theorem 1 1 there exists a solution y r 2 r to 1 9 y x 1 y 2 y 3 0 x x 1 x 2 r 2 such that i y is positive in the upper half plane and odd with respect to x 2 i e y x 1 x 2 y x 1 x 2 ii y and its derivatives are bounded in the half planes s 0 r s 0 r iii y is minimal with respect to perturbations c 0 r 2 such that x 1 x 2 x 1 x 2 iv y x 1 x 2 ai x 1 o 1 as x 1 uniformly in x 2 v for every x 2 r fixed let y t 1 t 2 2 3 2 t 1 1 3 y 3 2 t 1 2 3 x 2 t 2 32 t 1 1 3 then 1 10 lim l y t 1 l t 2 tanh t 2 2 when x 2 0 1 when x 2 0 1 when x 2 0 for the c 1 loc r 2 convergence vi yx 1 x 1 x 2 0 x 1 r x 2 0 vii yx 2 x 1 x 2 0 x 1 x 2 r and liml y x 1 x 2 l h x 1 in c 2 loc r 2 where h is the hastings mcleod solution of 1 4 the solution provided by theorem 1 1 has a form of a quadruple connection between the airy function ai the two one dimensional hastings mcleod solutions h and the heteroclinic orbit of the one dimensional allen cahn equation comparing iv with 1 8 we see that as x 1 the function y x 1 x 2 behaves similarly as the hastings mcleod solution h x 1 at the same time as x 2 we have y x 1 x 2 h x 1 x 2 perhaps the most interesting aspect of the above solution y is stated in property v since after rescaling we obtain as x 1 the convergence to the heteroclinic orbit x tanh x 2 of the allen cahn o d e 1 1 in the proof of theorem 1 1 it is shown that a minimal solution of 1 9 rescaled as in v converges as x 1 to a minimal solution of 1 2 this deep connection of the structure of the painleve equation with the allen cahn p d e suggests that several properties of the allen cahn equation should be transfered to the painleve equation although by construction the solution y is only minimal for odd perturbations we expect that y is actually minimal for general perturbations and plays a similar role 3 that the heteroclinic orbit for the allen cahn equation what s more the two global minimizers 1 of the functional eac have their counterparts in the two minimal solutions h of the painleve equation indeed property vii establishes that y connects monotonically along the vertical direction x 2 the two minimal solutions h x 1 in the same way that connects monotonically the two global minimizers 1 while is a one dimensional object the solution y x 1 x 2 is two dimensional since x 1 parametrizes the branches of minima of the potential h and only x 2 is involved in the phase transition we believe that in higher dimension y rn 1 r n 1 the structure of solutions of 1 9 exactly mirrors that of 1 2 and going further one may ask is it true that that in dimension n 7 any minimal solution y r n 1 r of 1 9 is either y x 1 x 2 xn 1 h x 1 or y x 1 x 2 xn 1 y x 1 x 2 xn 1 n b for some constant b r and some unit vector n sn 1 acknowledgments m g clerc was partially supported by fondecyt 1180903 m kowalczyk was partially supported by chilean research grants fondecyt 1130126 and 1170164 fondo basal

energy functional 2 1 e u r 2 2 u 2 1 2 x u 2 1 4 u 4 where u h 1 r 2 and 0 is a small parameters we suppose that c r 2 is radial i e x rad x with rad c r an even function in addition we assume that 2 2 l r 2 rad 0 in 0 and rad 0 for a unique 0 in the physical context described in 8 the function is specific x e x 2 with some 0 1 f x 1 2 x but this particular form is irrelevant here the euler lagrange equation of e is 2 3 2 u x u u 3 0 x x 1 x 2 r 2 and we also write its weak formulation 2 4 r 2 2 u u u 3 0 h 1 r 2 where denotes the inner product in r 2 note that due to the radial symmetry of the energy 2 1 and equation 2 3 are invariant under orthogonal transformations in the domain and sign change in the range our strategy to construct the solution of 1 9 enjoying the properties described in theorem 1 1 is to find first an odd with respect to x 2 minimizer u of e and then scaling and passing to the limit 0 recover y this gives us existence second in section 3 we show all the properties of y stated in theorem 1 1 we explain formally at the moment the relation between 1 9 and the energy e looking at the energy density of e it is evident that as 0 the modulus of the global or odd minimizer u should approach a nonnegative root of the polynomial x z z 3 0 or in other words u as 0 in some perhaps weak sense this function called the thomas fermi limit of the minimizer is not in h 1 r 2 and therefore the transition near the set x 0 has to be mediated somehow to see this let us consider a point such that 0 by 2 2 e i at introduce local orthogonal frame e i ie i and coordinates s s 1 s 2 associated with it let u be any solution of 2 3 and z s 1 3 u 2 3 s noting that 2 3 s 2 3 s 1 1 with 1 0 we get that z satisfies sz s 1 1 z z 3 o 1 as 0 4 the equation on the left becomes the second painleve equation after passing to the limit and suitable scaling now suppose that u is the odd minimizer of e i e u x 1 x 2 u x 1 x 2 except for the points x 0 the limiting function z could be one of the hastings mcleod one dimensional solutions however at 0 we should have z s 1 s 2 z s 1 s 2 which means that z genuinely depends on both variables this is the idea behind the proof of the existence part in theorem 1 1 showing properties of the solution is a different story and depends on rather tricky application of the moving plane method our first purpose in this paper is to study qualitative properties of the global minimizers of e as 0 in our previous work 12 we studied the following energy e u r r 2 ux 2 1 2 x u 2 1 4 u 4 af x u u r r where a 0 is a parameter and f 1 2 and in 13 we studied its analog for maps u r 2 r 2 by proceeding as in 13 one can see that under the above assumptions there exists a global minimizer v of e in h 1 r 2 namely that e v minh 1 r 2 e in addition we show that v is a classical solution of 2 3 and v is radial similarly in the class h 1 odd r 2 u h 1 r 2 u x 1 x 2 u x 1 x 2 of odd functions with respect to x 2 there exists an odd minimizer u which also solves 2 3 and satisfies u x 1 x 2 u x 1 x 2 although in the sequel we will focus on the odd minimizer for completeness we chose to present our next result in a slightly more general framework theorem 2 1 for 1 let u be a solution of 2 3 converging to 0 as x which may be the odd or global minimizer let 0 be the zero of rad and let 1 rad 0 for every e i we consider the local coordinates s s 1 s 2 in the basis e i iei and the rescaled functions 2 5 w s 2 1 2 1 1 3 u 2 3 s 1 1 3 as 0 the function w converges in c 2 loc r 2 up to subsequence to a function y bounded in the half planes s 0 r for every s 0 r which is a solution of 2 6 y s s 1 y s 2 y 3 s 0 s s 1 s 2 r 2 in particular if we take u to be the odd minimizer of e and 0 then the solution y satisfies y s 1 s 2 y s 1 s 2 and is minimal with respect to perturbations c 0 r 2 s 1 s 2 s 1 s 2 on the other hand if we take u to be the global minimizer then y s 1 s 2 h s 1 or y s 1 s 2 h s 1 we observe that as a corollary of 14 theorem 1 1 it can be proven that v in c 0 loc d 0 because of the analogy between the functional e and the gross pitaevskii functional in the theory of bose einstein condensates we will call the thomas fermi limit of v theorem 2 1 gives account on how non smoothness of the limit of v is mediated near the circumference x where changes sign through the solution of 2 6 we should mention here that detailed description of the minimizers for yet more general setting of the energy can be found in 13 14 before proving the theorem we gather general results for minimizers and solutions that are valid for any values of the parameters 0 for the rest of this paper v or v will be the global minimizer and u or u will be the odd minimizer or a critical point of e we first prove the existence of global and odd minimizers lemma 2 2 for every 0 there exists v h 1 r 2 such that e v minh 1 r 2 e as a consequence v is a c classical solution of 2 3 moreover for 1 the global minimizer v is unique up to change of v by v and it can be written as v x vrad x with vrad c r positive even and such that lim vrad 0 proof we proceed as in 13 lemma 2 1 to establish that the global minimizer exists and is a smooth solution of 2 3 converging to 0 as x next we notice that v 6 0 for 1 indeed by choosing a test function 6 0 supported in d 0 x 2 0 and such that 2 2 one can see that e 2 r 2 2 1 4 r 2 2 2 2 0 1 let x 0 r 2 be such that v x 0 6 0 without loss of generality we may assume that v x 0 0 next consider v v which is another global minimizer and thus another solution clearly in a neighborhood of x 0 we 5 have v v and as a consequence of the unique continuation principle cf 26 we deduce that v v 0 on r 2 furthermore the maximum principle implies that v 0 since v 6 0 to prove that v is radial we consider the reflection with respect to the line x 1 0 we can check that e v x 1 0 e v x 1 0 since otherwise by even reflection we can construct a map in h 1 with energy smaller than v thus the map v x v x 1 x 2 is also a minimizer and since v v on x 1 0 it follows by unique continuation that v v on r 2 repeating the same argument for any line of reflection we deduce that v is radial to complete the proof it remains to show the uniqueness of v up to change of v by v let v be another global minimizer such that v 0 and v 6 v choosing u in 2 4 we find for any solution u h 1 r 2 of 2 3 the following alternative expression of the energy 2 7 e u r 2 u 4 4 formula 2 7 implies that v and v intersect for x r 0 however setting w x v x for x r v x for x r we can see that w is another global minimizer and again by the unique continuation principle we have w v v this completes the proof of lemma 2 2 on the other hand in the class h 1 odd r 2 u h 1 r 2 u x 1 x 2 u x 1 x 2 of odd functions with respect to x 2 there exists an odd minimizer with the following properties lemma 2 3 for every 0 there exists u h 1 odd r 2 such that e u minh 1 odd r 2 e as a consequence u is a c classical solution of 2 3 moreover i u x 0 as x ii u x 1 x 2 u x 1 x 2 iii up to transformation u 7 u we have u x 1 x 2 0 x 1 x 2 r 0 provided that 1 proof the existence of u h 1 odd r 2 such that e u minh 1 odd r 2 e follows as in 13 lemma 2 1 and clearly u is a critical point of e in the subspace h 1 odd r 2 in view of the radial symmetry of it is easy to see that the euler lagrange equation 2 4 holds also for every h 1 r 2 such that x 1 x 2 x 1 x 2 as a consequence u is a c classical solution of 2 3 for the proof of i we refer to 13 lemma 2 1 to show that u x 1 x 2 u x 1 x 2 we first note that e u 0 r e u 0 r indeed if we assume without loss of generality that e u 0 r e u 0 r the function 2 8 u x 1 x 2 u x 1 x 2 when x 1 0 u x 1 x 2 when x 1 0 has strictly less energy than u which is a contradiction thus e u 0 r e u 0 r and as a consequence the function u is also an odd minimizer and a solution it follows by unique continuation 26 that u u that is u x 1 x 2 u x 1 x 2 now it remains to establish the uniqueness of the odd minimizer u when 1 proceeding as in lemma 2 2 we can see that u 6 0 for 1 and that either u 0 or u 0 on r 0 assume that u 1 and u 2 are two minimizers of e in h 1 odd r 2 such that u 1 0 and u 2 0 on r 0 next define the maps 2 9 u x 1 x 2 min u 1 x 1 x 2 u 2 x 1 x 2 when x 2 0 max u 1 x 1 x 2 u 2 x 1 x 2 when x 2 0 2 10 u x 1 x 2 max u 1 x 1 x 2 u 2 x 1 x 2 when x 2 0 min u 1 x 1 x 2 u 2 x 1 x 2 when x 2 0 and the set a x 1 x 2 r 0 u 1 x 1 x 2 u 2 x 1 x 2 we can see that e u 1 a e u 2 a since otherwise we have either e u e u 2 or e u e u 1 which contradicts the minimality of u 1 and u 2 as a consequence e u e u 2 e u 1 e u and it follows that u and u are also minimizers and 6 solutions next by unique continuation 26 we obtain that either u 1 u or u 1 u i e we have either 0 u 1 u 2 or u 1 u 2 0 on r 0 finally applying 2 7 to e u 1 e u 2 we conclude in view of the ordering of u 1 and u 2 that u 1 u 2 this completes the proof to study the limit of solutions as 0 we need uniform bounds modifying slightly the arguments in 13 section 2 we obtain lemma 2 4 for every 0 let u be a solution of 2 3 converging to 0 as x then u are uniformly bounded proof we drop the index and write u u since is bounded the roots of the cubic equation u 3 x u 0 belong to a bounded interval for all values of x if u takes positive values then it attains its maximum 0 maxr 2 u u x 0 at a point x 0 r 2 in view of 2 3 0 2 u x 0 u 3 x 0 x 0 u x 0 thus it follows that u x 0 is uniformly bounded above in the same way we prove the uniform lower bound for u lemma 2 5 for 1 let u be a solution of 2 3 converging to 0 as x then there exist a constant k 0 such that 2 11 u x k max x 0 1 3 x r 2 as a consequence if for every ei we consider the local coordinates s s 1 s 2 in the basis e i iei then the rescaled functions w s defined in 2 5 are uniformly bounded on the half planes s 0 r s 0 r proof as above we write u u let us define the following constants m 0 is the uniform bound of u cf lemma 2 4 0 is such that 3 rad h 2 h h 0 0 is such that 4 6 next we construct the following comparison function 2 12 x x 2 3 2 for x 2 2 3 x 2 3 2 for x 2 3 0 for x 2 3 one can check that c 1 r 2 0 h 1 r 2 satisfies 2 2 3 in h 1 r 2 finally we define the function u 2 2 2 2 3 and compute 2 2 u 2 u u u 2 u 4 2 u 2 u 4 2 4 3 2 13 now one can see that when x x r 2 x 0 we have u 4 3 u 2 0 since x d 0 u 4 3 2 3 x 2 3 2 u 2 u 2 in the open set we also have u 4 3 4 3 4 3 2 4 3 thus 0 in in the h 1 sense to conclude we apply kato s inequality that gives 0 on r 2 in the h 1 sense since is subharmonic with compact support we obtain by the maximum principle that 0 or equivalently 0 in r 2 the statement of the lemma follows by adjusting the constant k after this preparation we are ready to prove the main result of this section 7 proof theorem 2 1 for every ei we consider the local coordinates s s 1 s 2 in the basis e i iei and we rescale the solutions by setting u s u s 2 3 1 3 clearly u s u s 2 3 thus u s s 2 3 2 3 u s u 3 s 0 s r 2 writing h 1 h 1 h a h with 1 rad 0 a c r 2 r 2 and a 0 0 we obtain 2 14 u s 1 s 1 a s 2 3 s u s u 3 s 0 s r 2 next we define the rescaled energy by 2 15 e u r 2 1 2 u s 2 s 2 3 2 2 3 u 2 s 1 4 u 4 s ds with this definition e u 1 5 3 e u from lemma 2 5 and 2 14 it follows that u and also u are uniformly bounded on compact sets moreover by differentiating 2 14 we also obtain the boundedness of the second derivatives of u thanks to these uniform bounds we can apply the theorem of ascoli via a diagonal argument to obtain the convergence of u in c 2 loc r 2 up to a subsequence to a solution z of 2 16 z s 1 s 1 z s z 3 s 0 s r 2 which is associated to the functional 2 17 e 0 j j 1 2 s 2 1 2 s 1 2 s 1 4 4 s ds given s a test function supported in the compact set k let x 1 3 x 2 3 s s 2 3 1 3 in the case where we take u to be the global minimizer v since e v supp e v supp we have e v k e v k and at the limit e 0 z k e 0 z k thus z is a minimal solution of 2 16 in addition the radial symmetry of v implies that z depends only on the variable s 1 indeed noticing that lim 0 2 3 s 1 s 2 2 3 s 1 it follows that v s 1 s 2 v s 1 o 1 0 and z s 1 s 2 z s 1 0 similarly in the case where we take u to be the odd minimizer and 0 we can see that z is a minimal solution of 2 16 for perturbations such that s 1 s 2 s 1 s 2 finally setting y s 1 2 1 1 3 z s 1 1 3 2 16 reduces to 2 6 that is y solves 2 6 in the case where we take u to be the global minimizer v we can see that either y s 1 s 2 h s 1 or y s 1 s 2 h s 1 since h are the only minimal solutions of 1 4 cf 12 theorem 1 3 on the other hand in the case where we take u to be the odd minimizer and 0 it is clear that y is odd with respect to s 2 and minimal for perturbations such that s 1 s 2 s 1 s 2 3 proof of theorem 1 1 we will proceed in few steps the proof of i ii and iii follows from theorem 2 1 lemma 2 5 and the fact that a minimal solution of 1 9 cannot be identically zero to establish v we proceed as in theorem 2 1 after rescaling appropriately y as x 1 we compute uniform bounds of the rescaled functions then by the theorem of ascoli we obtain at the limit a minimal solution of the allen cahn equation 1 2 the proof of vi and vii is based on the moving plane method applied in a sector contained in the upper half plane the main difficulty is due to the unboundedness of the domain and to the availability of boundary conditions only on the x 1 axis where y x 1 0 0 we also utilize the asymptotic behaviour of y as x 1 provided respectively by v and lemma 3 2 our main tool is a version of the maximum principle in unbounded domains cf lemma 3 1 that allows us to compute bounds for yx 1 and yx 2 when x 1 is large enough and x 2 0 cf lemmas 3 3 and 3 4 next these bounds are extended to the whole half plane x 2 0 by applying the sliding method cf lemma 3 5 proof of i ii and iii by applying theorem 2 1 in a neighborhood of the point 0 to the odd minimizer u such that u 0 on r 0 it is clear that we obtain a solution y of 2 6 which is odd with respect to the second variable s 2 and such that y 0 on r 0 for the sake of convenience in what follows we substitute the variables s 1 s 2 by x 1 x 2 the properties ii and iii are also straightforward by theorem 2 1 and lemma 2 5 thus it remains to show that y x 1 x 2 0 x r 0 assume by 8 contradiction that y x 1 x 2 0 for some x r 0 then it follows from the maximum principle that y 0 to conclude we are going to show that a solution y of 1 9 which is minimal for odd perturbations cannot be identically zero indeed the minimality of y implies that the second variation of the energy epii is nonnegative 3 1 r 2 x 2 6 y 2 x x 1 2 x dx 0 c 10 r 2 such that x 1 x 2 x 1 x 2 clearly 3 1 does not hold when y 0 if we take x 0 x 1 l x 2 with l and 0 c 10 r 2 fixed such that 0 x 1 x 2 0 x 1 x 2 and 0 6 0 next we recall a useful version of the maximum principle in unbounded domains 9 lemma 2 1 lemma 3 1 let d be a domain open connected set in rn possibly unbounded assume that d is disjoint from the closure of an infinite open connected cone suppose there is a function z in c d that is bounded above and satisfies for some continuous function c x z c x z 0 in d with c x 0 z 0 on d then z 0 in d as a first application of lemma 3 1 we prove the exponential convergence of y to 0 as x 1 lemma 3 2 y x 1 x 2 o e 2 3 x 3 2 1 as x 1 uniformly in x 2 proof we define x 1 x 2 me 2 3 x 3 2 1 in the domain d x 1 x 2 x 1 1 x 2 0 where m e 2 3 supx 2 0 y 1 x 2 is a constant it is easy to see that x 1 in d and y x 1 y in d since y 0 on d it follows from lemma 3 1 that y in d proof of v we set t 1 t 2 2 3 x 1 3 2 x 1 1 2 r where x 1 1 and r r equivalently we have x 1 r 3 2 t 1 2 3 t 2 32 t 1 1 3 next we define y t 1 t 2 2 3 2 t 1 1 3 y x 1 r x 2 for every x 2 r fixed or equivalently 3 2 y x 1 r x 2 x 1 1 2 2 y t 1 t 2 we are going to show that y t 1 t 2 is uniformly bounded up to the second derivatives when t 2 belongs to a compact interval and t 1 by differentiating 3 2 with respect to s 1 and r we obtain 3 3 a 2 yx 2 x 1 r x 2 x 1 y t 2 t 1 t 2 3 3 b 2 yx 2 x 2 x 1 r x 2 x 1 3 2 y t 2 t 2 t 1 t 2 3 3 c 2 yx 1 x 1 r x 2 1 2 x 1 1 2 y t 1 t 2 x 1 y t 1 t 1 t 2 r 2 y t 2 t 1 t 2 3 3 d 2 yx 1 x 2 y t 2 x 1 3 2 y t 1 t 2 r 2 x 1 1 2 y t 2 t 2 3 3 e 2 yx 1 x 1 1 4 x 1 3 2 y 3 2 y t 1 r 4 x 1 1 y t 2 x 1 3 2 y t 1 t 1 r x 1 1 2 y t 1 t 2 r 2 4 x 1 1 2 y t 2 t 2 since by construction cf 2 11 in lemma 2 5 y satisfies y x 1 x 2 o x 1 1 2 as x 1 i e y is bounded we obtain by 1 9 and standard elliptic estimates 21 3 4 p 37 that 3 4 y x 1 x 2 o x 1 3 2 and d 2 y x 1 x 2 o x 1 5 2 as x 1 from 3 4 and 3 3 it follows that 3 5 y t 1 t 2 o x 1 1 2 and d 2 y t 1 t 2 o x 1 as x 1 9 provided that t 1 t 2 t 0 r 0 t 1 t 2 t 1 t 0 t 2 r 0 32 t 1 1 3 where t 0 0 and r 0 0 are arbitrary constants in particular we have 2 y x 1 x 2 x 1 3 2 y t 1 t 2 o x 1 3 2 for t 1 t 2 t 0 r 0 on the other hand it is clear by 1 9 that 2 y x 1 x 2 x 1 3 2 y 3 t 1 t 2 y t 1 t 2 thus 3 6 y t 1 t 2 and y t 1 t 2 are bounded t 1 t 2 t 0 r 0 similarly by differentiating once more equations 3 3 with respect to x 1 and r one can show that 3 7 d 2 y t 1 t 2 is bounded t 1 t 2 t 0 r 0 next we apply the theorem of ascoli to the sequence y t 1 l t 2 as l up to a subsequence ln we obtain via a diagonal argument the convergence in c 1 loc r 2 of y n t 1 t 2 y t 1 ln t 2 to a bounded function z t 1 t 2 that we are going to determine our claim is that the limit z is a minimal solution of the allen cahn equation 1 2 which is independent of the subsequence ln the proof of this property is based on the following energy considerations let e 1 e 2 be the canonical basis of r 2 the energy functional 3 8 epii y a a x 2 e 2 1 2 y x 1 r x 2 2 1 2 x 1 y 2 x 1 r x 2 1 2 y 4 x 1 r x 2 dx 1 dr associated to 1 9 becomes after changing variables as in 3 2 3 9 epii y a e pii y a f y a

y l t 1 t 2 y t 1 l t 2 note that b l supp l b le 1 and supp l t 1 t 2 t 1 1 when l 1 c thus for l 1 c we can define l c 0 r 2 by l x 1 r x 2 x 1 1 2 2 l t 1 t 2 as in 3 2 let bl x 1 t 1 r t 1 t 2 x 2 t 1 t 2 b l we first examine the case where x 2 0 and assume that t 1 t 2 t 1 t 2 in view of the minimality of y and 3 9 we have 3 13 e pii y l b l epii y l bl epii y bl e pii y b l on the one hand it is clear that the boundedness of y and 3 6 imply that liml r y l b l 0 and liml r y b l 0 next setting t 0 c l we have 3 14 3 2 t 1 2 3 3 2 t 0 2 3 d 3 2 t 0 1 3 t 1 t 0 d t 0 thus we obtain 3 15 f y

z b this means that z is a minimal solution of the allen cahn equation 1 2 for odd perturbations in particular z 6 0 and as a consequence of the maximum principle z t 1 0 0 t 1 r and z t 1 t 2 0 t 1 t 2 r 0 imply that z t 1 t 2 0 t 1 t 2 r 0 thus from 10 theorem 1 5 it follows that z is a function of only t 2 which is the heteroclinic connection z t 1 t 2 t 2 tanh t 2 2 furthermore since the limit z is uniquely determined the convergence y l t 1 t 2 z t 1 t 2 holds as l it remains to examine the case where x 2 6 0 without loss of generality we assume that x 2 0 now 3 13 holds for arbitrary test functions t 1 t 2 c 0 r 2 since bl x 1 x 2 x 2 0 as l repeating the previous arguments we find that z is a nonnegative minimal solution of 1 2 applying 6 corollary 5 2 we deduce that z 1 this completes the proof of v proof of vi and vii the proofs of vi and vii which are based on the moving plane method follow from the next lemmas lemma 3 3 we have yx 1 x 1 x 2 0 x 1 0 x 2 0 in addition for every d 0 there holds supx 2 d yx 1 1 x 2 0 and infx 2 d y 1 x 2 0 proof given 0 we define the function x 1 x 2 y x 1 x 2 y x 1 2 x 2 for x 1 x 2 d x 1 x 2 x 1 x 2 0 one can check that 0 on d and c x 1 x 2 2 x 1 y x 1 2 x 2 0 with c x 1 x 2 x 1 2 y 2 x 1 x 2 y x 1 x 2 y x 1 2 x 2 y 2 x 1 2 x 2 0 furthermore is bounded above by theorem 1 1 ii and not identically zero by theorem 1 1 v as a conse quence of lemma 3 1 it follows that x 1 x 2 0 x 1 x 2 0 and thus by hopf s lemma x 1 x 2 2 yx 1 x 2 0 x 2 0 to establish that supx 2 d yx 1 1 x 2 0 we proceed by contradiction and assume the existence of a sequence ln such that limn ln and limn yx 1 1 ln 0 next we set y n x 1 x 2 y x 1 x 2 ln in view of the bounds provided in theorem 1 1 ii we obtain by the theorem of ascoli that up to subsequence y n converges in c 1 loc to a nonnegative minimal solution y of 1 9 since y x 1 1 0 limn yx 1 1 ln 0 and y x 1 x 1 x 2 0 x 1 0 x 2 r the maximum principle applied to 3 18 y x 1 y x 1 6 y 2 y x 1 x 1 6 y 2 y x 1 implies that y x 1 x 1 x 2 0 x 1 0 x 2 r then since limx 1 y x 1 x 2 0 x 2 r it follows that y 0 in the half plane x 1 0 finally we deduce by unique continuation that y 0 in r 2 which is a contradiction since y is minimal thus we have established that supx 2 d yx 1 1 x 2 0 the proof that infx 2 d y 1 x 2 0 is similar lemma 3 4 for every vector n ei 2 c r 2 with 0 2 there exists s n 0 such that y x 1 x 2 n 0 x 1 sn x 2 0 proof our first claim is that there is a constant k 1 0 such that k 1 yx 1 x 1 x 2 x 1 y x 1 x 2 x 1 1 x 2 0 indeed let x 1 x 2 k 1 yx 1 x 1 x 2 x 1 y x 1 x 2 for x 1 x 2 d x 1 1 x 2 0 where the constant k 1 will be adjusted later it is clear that x 1 0 0 x 1 1 we also note that yx 1 x 2 1 0 0 since the function yx 1 vanishes at 1 0 is negative in x 1 0 x 2 0 and satisfies 3 18 this and supx 2 d yx 1 1 x 2 0 d 0 imply that when k 1 is large enough we have 1 x 2 0 x 2 0 next we compute x 1 6 y 2 1 k 1 x 1 k 1 yx 1 x 1 2 y 2 k 1 x 1 1 4 x 21 x 1 y x 1 2 y 2 k 1 x 1 1 4 x 21 4 y 2 1 k 1 x 1 k 1 x 1 1 4 x 21 k 1 yx 1 11 by choosing k 1 large enough we can ensure that x 1 2 y 2 k 1 x 1 1 4 x 2 1 0 and 4 y 2 1 k 1 x 1 k 1 x 1 1 4 x 2 1 0 when x 1 1 and x 2 0 thus by applying lemma 3 1 our claim follows similarly we are going to establish that there is a constant k 2 0 such that yx 2 x 1 x 2 k 2 y x 1 x 2 x 1 1 x 2 0 to do this we let x 1 x 2 yx 2 x 1 x 2 k 2 y x 1 x 2 for x 1 x 2 d where the constant k 2 will again be adjusted later we first note that yx 2 x 1 0 0 x 1 r since the function y vanishes at x 1 0 is positive in x 2 0 and satisfies 1 9 this and infx 2 d y 1 x 2 0 d 0 imply that when k 2 is large enough we have 1 x 2 0 x 2 0 on the other hand it is clear that x 1 0 0 x 1 1 next we compute x 1 6 y 2 yx 2 x 1 2 y 2 k 2 y x 1 6 y 2 thus by applying lemma 3 1 it follows that 0 in d finally setting y y e i when x 1 x 2 d with 2 3 2 we find that tan yx 2 yx 1 k 1 k 2 x 1 arctan k 1 k 2 x 1 as a consequence we have y x 1 x 2 n 0 if arctan k 1 k 2 x 1 2 that is if x 1 sn k 1 k 2 tan 2 lemma 3 5 let 0 2 be fixed and consider for every r the reflection with respect to the line x 1 x 2 x 2 tan x 1 and the domain d x 1 x 2 0 x 2 tan x 1 then the function x 1 x 2 y x 1 x 2 y x 1 x 2 is negative in d for every r proof we set n ei 2 as in lemma 3 4 and denote by p q the image by of a point p q d and by d the set d it is obvious that x 1 0 0 x 1 and that x 1 x 2 0 x 1 x 2 moreover satisfies p q c p q p p y p q 0 p q d with c p q p 2 y 2 p q y p q y p q y 2 p q for each r we consider the statement 3 19 p q 0 p q d we shall first establish lemma 3 5 in the case where 0 4 according to lemma 3 4 3 19 is valid for each sn set 0 inf r 0 holds in d for each we will prove 0 assume instead 0 r then there exist a sequence k 0 such that limk k 0 and a sequence pk qk d k such that y pk qk y p k q k according to lemma 3 4 we have p k sn thus the sequence pk qk is bounded up to subsequence we may assume that limk pk qk p 0 q 0 d 0 with p 0 sn by definition of 0 we have 0 0 in d 0 and 0 p 0 q 0 0 i e y p 0 q 0 y p 0 q 0 now we distinguish the following cases if p 0 q 0 d 0 the maximum principle implies that 0 0 in d 0 clearly this situation is excluded since y is positive in the half plane x 2 0 on the other hand the maximum principle also implies that 0 n p q 2 y n p q 0 provided that p q 0 and q 0 furthermore the previous inequality still holds at the vertex p q 0 0 since yx 2 x 1 0 0 and yx 1 x 1 0 0 x 1 r cf the proof of lemma 3 4 as a consequence in a neighborhood of the line segment x 1 x 2 x 2 tan x 1 0 x 1 sn we have that y n 0 and it follows that p 0 q 0 cannot belong to 0 finally since the case where p 0 0 and q 0 0 is ruled out because y is positive in the half plane x 2 0 we have reached a contradiction next we establish lemma 3 5 in the case where 4 2 which is a little bit more involved when 4 it is clear that 3 19 is valid for each sn otherwise when 4 2 let a p q d p sn and let a a our first claim is that m infa sn 1 y 0 indeed proceeding as in the proof of theorem 1 1 v one can see that lim x 1 x 2 a xn 1 x 1 2 x 1 y x 1 x 2 1 in addition proceeding as in the proof of lemma 3 4 we obtain that inf y x 1 x 2 x 1 x 2 a sn 1 sn l x 1 sn 0 for every constant l 0 thus m 0 on the other hand we have lim sup y x 1 x 2 12 figure 1 the sets a a b b and the lines in the case where sn and sn x 1 x 2 a 0 since lim inf x 1 x 1 x 2 a 0 cf lemma 3 2 as a consequence when sn 1 is large enough we have y p q m y p q p q a and also y p q y p q p q d a by definition of sn this establishes that 3 19 holds for large enough then defining 0 as previously we assume by contradiction that 0 r and deduce in a similar way the existence of the sequences k and pk qk d k we need to show that pk qk is bounded for letm tan and let x 1 x 2 x 2 tan 2 x 1 tan be the line parallel to n and passing through m let also b p q a q tan 2 p tan be the subset of a which is above and b b proceeding as previously we can see that 0 2 0 1 we have infb y m for some constant m 0 while lim sup y x 1 x 2 x 1 x 2 b 0 as a consequence for large enough and 0 1 we have y p q m y p q p q b and thus pk qk b k furthermore since p k sn by lemma 3 4 we have established the boundedness of pk qk to complete the proof we utilize the same arguments detailed in the case where 0 4 lemma 3 5 implies that 0 2 r and p q with q 0 we have n p q 2 y n p q 0 where n ei 2 it follows that yx 1 x 1 x 2 0 and yx 2 x 1 x 2 0 x 1 r x 2 0 moreover in the half plane x 2 0 yx 1 and yx 2 satisfy respectively yx 1 x 1 6 y 2 yx 1 and yx 2 x 1 6 y 2 yx 2 thus yx 1 resp yx 2 cannot vanish in the open half plane x 2 0 since otherwise we would obtain by the maximum principle yx 1 0 resp yx 2 0 these situations are excluded by the fact that y 0 in the open half plane x 2 0 and yx 2 x 1 0 0 x 1 r therefore we have proved that yx 1 x 1 x 2 0 x 1 r x 2 0 and yx 2 x 1 x 2 0 x 1 x 2 r finally setting y l x 1 x 2 y x 1 x 2 l we obtain by the theorem of ascoli that up to a subsequence lk y lk converges in c 2 loc to a nonnegative minimal solution y of 1 9 furthermore the monotonicity of y along the x 2 direction implies that y is independent of x 2 thus since h is the only nonnegative minimal solution of 1 9 cf 12 theorem 1 3 we deduce that y x 1 x 2 h x 1 and that liml y x 1 x 2 l h x 1 is independent of the subsequence lk we also note that y x 1 x 2 h x 1 x 1 x 2 r 2 from which theorem 1 1 iv follows this completes the proof of theorem 1 1 13 references 1 m j ablowitz and p a clarkson solitons nonlinear evolution equations and inverse scattering london
