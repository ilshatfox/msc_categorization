identification of a boundary influx condition in a one phase stefan problem chifaa ghanmi saloua mani aouadi and faouzi triki abstract we consider a one dimensional one phase inverse stefan problem for the heat equation it consists in recovering a boundary influx condition from the knowledge of the position of the moving front and the initial state we derived a logarithmic stability estimate that shows that the inversion is ill posed the proof is based on integral equations and unique continuation for holomorphic functions we also proposed a direct algorithm with a regularization term to solve the nonlinear inverse problem several numerical tests using noisy data are provided with relative errors analysis 1 introduction stefan problem is a specific type of free boundary problems in partial differential equations related to heat diffusion it aims to describe the temperature distribution in a homogeneous medium undergoing a phase change for example water passing to ice stefan problems model finds application in many engineering settings in which there is melting or freezing causing a boundary change in time examples include melting of ice recrystallization of metals tumor growth freezing of liquids etc 25 30 the stefan problem for the heat equation consists in determining the temperature and location of the melting front delimiting the different phases when the initial and boundary conditions are given conversely the inverse stefan problem is to recover boundary conditions and or initial condition from measurement of the moving boundary position the stefan problem as a mathematical model has been studied in the literature for many decades and has attracted the attention of many mathematicians and physicists see for instance 23 30 36 and references therein the direct stefan problem is known to be well posed i e it possesses a unique solution which depends con tinuously on the data provided that the initial state and the source functions have the correct signs 17 21 if the sign requirements are not fulfilled the direct stefan problem may not have a global solution or may be an ill posed problem 4 28 in contrast with the direct stefan problem only few theoretical results are available for the related inverse problem indeed most published materials have considered the numerical reconstruction of the temperature or heat flux on the boundary 12 14 26 27 31 35 solving numerically both direct and inverse stefan problems can be a difficult task because of the free boundary the nonlinearity and the ill posedness in the sense that these problems may not possess a solution or that in case there exist solutions they may not depend continuously on the given data 8 31 34 in this paper we are interested in solving the so called one dimensional one phase inverse stefan problem which is to find the heat influx at the boundary from the knowledge of the moving free boundary the one dimensional stefan problem has been extensively studied by many authors 7 14 18 30 33 34 assuming that the temperature of the solid is constant and the heat conduction in the melted portion is governed by the heat equation leads to a simple one phase free boundary value problem if in addition the heat influx stays positive which means that heat is continuously entering the domain only one phase remains and the direct stefan problem admits a unique global smooth solution the inverse problem can be recasted as a non date february 24 2020 the work of ft is supported in part by the grant anr 17 ce 40 0029 of the french national research agency anr project

several authors under different smoothness assumptions on the boundary influx and the initial state 9 11 18 19 the novelty in this paper is a logarithmic stability estimate of the inversion and the numerical treatment of the problem based on the resolution of regularized linear integral equations this paper is composed of five sections section 2 provides an introduction to the direct problem we first recall known useful existence uniqueness stability and regularity properties for solutions of the classical one stefan problem in theorems 2 1 and 2 2 we set the inverse stefan problem in section 3 the main stability estimate is given in theorem 3 1 we detailed the proof of the principal results in section 4 finally section 5 is devoted to the numerical resolution of both the direct and inverse stefan problems several numerical tests are provided with relative errors analysis 2 the direct problem we next introduce the one dimension one phase stefan problem let b 0 and t 0 be two fixed constants for any positive function s c 0 t satisfying s 0 b we define the open set qs t r 0 t by 2 1 qs t x t 0 x s t 0 t t the direct stefan problem is to determine u x t c qs t c 2 1 qs t and s t c 1 0 t c 0 1 0 t satisfying ut uxx 0 in qs t 2 2 ux 0 t h t 0 0 t t 2 3 u x 0 u 0 x 0 0 x b 2 4 ux s t t s t 0 t t 2 5 u s t t 0 0 t t 2 6 s 0 b 2 7 where h c 0 t u 0 c 0 b are given let h 0 be a fixed constant throughout the paper we assume 2 8 h c 0 t h t 0 0 t t 2 9 u 0 c 0 b 0 u 0 x h b x 0 x b let m max h h 2 10 next we give a result of existence and uniqueness of the stefan problem 2 2 2 7 theorem 2 1 the problem 2 2 2 7 admits a unique solution s t u x t in addition the solution s t u x t satisfies 0 u x t m s t x in qs t 2 11 0 ux s t t s t m in 0 t 2 12 the proof is based on the maximum principle and the fixed point theorem the existence and uniqueness of the stefan problem has been studied by various authors under different smoothness assumptions see for instance 8 10 and references therein remark 2 1 the assumption on the sign of the flux h t means that heat is entering the domain so that for each t only one phase remains if the sign requirement on h t are not fulfilled the direct stefan problem may not have a global solution or may be an ill posed problem 4 28 3 remark 2 2 since c 0 1 0 t and w 1 0 t are somehow identical for smooth domains theorem 4 page 294 in 15 we deduce from theorem 2 1 that s w 1 0 t moreover a simple calculation gives s t b t 0 h d b 0 u 0 x dx s t 0 u x t dx 2 13 since u is nonnegative we deduce from 2 13 the following estimate b s t t h b u 0 1 in 0 t which combined to inequality 2 12 leads to s w 1 s max t h b u 0 1 m 2 14 next we give some useful properties of the solutions of stefan problem as well as their stability with respect to boundary and initial data consider two sets hi t u 0 i x i 1 2 of stefan data satisfying assumptions 2 8 and 2 9 theorem 2 1 guarantees the existence of an unique solution si ui to each one of the two problems theorem 2 2 if b 1 b 2 then the free boundaries s 1 t s 2 t corresponding to the data hi t u 0 i x i 1 2 satisfy s 1 t s 2 t c b 2 b 1 b 1 0 u 0 1 x u 0 2 x dx b 1 b 2 u 0 2 x dx t 0 h 1 h 2 d 0 t t 2 15 where c 0 only depends on t and m the proof of this theorem is detailed in 8 the constant c 0 appearing in theorem 2 2 is in fact exponentially increasing as function of t and m 3 the inverse problem in this paper we are interested in the following inverse problem to determine h ux from the knowledge of the moving boundary s and the initial state u 0 clearly the inverse stefan problem is a cauchy like problem of determining a function u which satisfies 11 p ut uxx 0 in qs t u x 0 u 0 x 0 0 x b ux s t t s t 0 t t u s t t 0 0 t t s 0 b 3 16 we first study the uniqueness of recovery of the heat flux for a given free boundary s c 1 0 t and a nonnegative initial state u 0 c 1 0 b showing the uniqueness in stefan inverse problem is then equivalent to proving that the linear non standard cauchy problem p admits a unique solution the following result has been established by j r cannon and j douglas in 11 proposition 3 1 for given s c 1 0 t and u 0 c 1 0 b there can exist at most one solution u c 2 qs t c 1 qs t of the problem p since u c 1 qs t we deduce from proposition 3 1 that there exists a unique solution to inverse stefan problem given by h ux notice that required c 1 regularity of the free boundary s t in the previous uniqueness result is not guar anteed by the regularity assumptions 2 8 and 2 9 does not need to be c 1 close to 0 in order to reach 4 chifaa ghanmi saloua mani aouadi and faouzi triki such a regularity one needs to impose stronger smoothness and compatibility conditions on the data 10 19 let a l 2 0 t l 2 0 t be the laplacian ah htt with dirichlet boundary condition it is an unbounded self adjoint strictly positive operator with a compact resolvent denote by d a 1 2 the domain of a 1 2 and introduce for r the scale of hilbert spaces x as follows for every 0 x d a 2 with the norm h a 2 h l 2 note that 0 a where a is the spectrum of a the space x is defined by duality with respect to the pivot space x as follows x x for 0 2 the norm h is given in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the operator a 29 let a 0 be the abel linear integral operator 6 a 0 l 2 0 t l 2 0 t a 0 h t 1 t 0 1 t h d in 29 the authors showed the equivalence between the norm h 12 and a 0 h l 2 that is there exists an universal constant c 0 such that c 1 h 12 a 0 h l 2 c h 12 3 17 next we state our main result in this paper theorem 3 1 let u 0 c 0 t be a given function verifying assumption 2 9 h h c 0 t be strictly positive functions satisfying h h m let u and u be the solutions to the system 2 2 2 7 associated to respectively h and h denote s s the free boundaries of respectively the solutions u and u and assume that s s w 1 e 1 then 3 18 h h 12 c ln ln s s w 1 where the constant c 0 depends only on u 0 b t h and m remark 3 1 the double logarithmic stability estimate 3 18 shows that the inverse stefan problem is indeed ill posed the obtained result is then consistent with known stability estimates in the standard cauchy problem for parabolic equations in time independent domains see for instance theorem 1 1 in 13 therefore the motion of the free boundary causing the nonlinearity and higher complexity of the direct problem does not seem to modify the nature of the cauchy inversion remark 3 2 our stability estimate is carried out within the hilbert scale x 12 but it can be also done using more classical spaces the characterization of x r in terms of sobolev spaces can be found in 29 the inequality 3 17 shows that the abel linear integral operator is invertible from l 2 0 t to x 12 and hence expressing h h in this later space is indeed the best choice when l 2 norm estimates of a 0 h h are available 4 proof of theorem 3 1 we first derive an integral representation of the solution of the system 2 2 2 7 the following result can be found in many references including 11 18 for the convenience of the reader we provide its proof lemma 4 1 under the assumptions of theorem 3 1 the solution u

solution to the following principal integral equation 4 28 t 0 n s t 0 t h d t 0 n s t s t s d b 0 n s t t 0 u 0 d for all t 0 t the proof of stability is based on estimating the modulus of continuity of the corresponding linear integral operator lemma 4 2 under the assumptions in theorem 3 1 the following inequality 4 29 t 0 n x 0 t h h d c s s 1 4 w 1 for all x s t 0 t t holds the constant c 0 only depends on u 0 b t h and m proof in the following proof c stands for a generic constant strictly larger than zero that only depends on u 0 b t h and m we deduce from remark 2 2 that there exists s 0 depending only on b m and t such that s w 1 s w 1 s without loss of generality we can assume that s 1 since u is the unique solution to the system 2 2 2 7 associated to s h it also satisfies 4 28 with h and s substituting respectively h and s on the right side taking the difference between the two linear equations 4 28 related respectively to u and u gives t 0 n s t 0 t h h d t 0 n s t 0 t n s

estimate w 0 a a c a e c a 4 47 holds for all a 0 s where c c 0 only depend on s taking z a at inequality 4 46 and using 4 47 we obtain the wanted estimate applying the estimate 4 45 to inequality 4

stability of our inverse problem we add a different level of gaussian noise to the data s t the tables 2 1 show that the accuracy is altered with noise and the relative error on the numerical solution is under 0 03 the figures 5 2 5 3 and the table 2 are obtained by using mid point rule in figure 5 1 we refined the error on the integration and use gauss legendre formulas of the third order we remark that we have a better stability around t 0 in figure 5 3 we present the evolution of the relative errors with different gaussian noise levels we remark that the numerical solutions are stable far away from 0 and they become more accurate as the amount of noise decreases the numerical results confirms the theoretical predictions of the theorem 3 1 which relates to the stability of the neumann condition h with respect to the free boundary s example 2 in this example the moving boundary is given by 5 73 s t t b t 0 1 we take the exact solution given by 5 74 u x t exp t x b 1 x t 0 s

figure 5 6 we plot the neumann condition h for three different gaussian noise levels 1 3 and 5 and when compared they match well with the exact solution especially far from t tending to 0 remark 5 1 notice that in the three considered examples the explicit boundary influxes are analytic func tions of t this explains the relatively good recovery of the boundary influx from the measurement of the free boundary far away from t 0 remark 5 2 recall that for a smooth right hand side f the inverse of the abel integral operator is given by 6 a 10 f t 1 f 0 t a 0 f t for t 0 t it seems that the regularization and discretization 5 62 of the abel like integral equation 4 28 produce a numerical weak singularity at the origin that doesn t match the real regularity of the boundary influx and slightly increases the relative error there this numerical problem will be considered in future works references 1 g alessandrini and f alberto sharp stability estimates of harmonic continuation along
