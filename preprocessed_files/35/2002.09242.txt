problem consists of recovering the refractive index of a medium from measurements of the scattered waves for multiple frequencies in this paper rigorous stability estimates are derived when the frequency takes value in a bounded interval it is showed that the ill posedness of the inverse medium problem decreases as the width of the frequency interval becomes larger more precisely under certain regularity assumptions on the refractive index the estimates indicate that the power in ho lder stability is an increasing function of the largest value in the frequency band finally a lipschitz stability estimate is obtained for the observable part of the medium function defined through a truncated trace formula ams subject classifications 35 l 05 35 r 30 74 b 05 secondary 47 a 52

refractive index of an one dimensional 1 d medium from boundary measurements for a fixed frequency it is known that this inverse problem is severely ill posed and suffers from the lack of uniqueness several numerical results show that in the case of multiple frequencies in contrast with the single frequency case the ill posedness decreases dramatically when the frequency band increases and covers the resonance region of the medium 14 11 6 5 and references therein however little is known about the stability for the inverse problem or the convergence issues for the numerical methods our goal of the present paper is to prove stability results for the multifrequency inverse medium scattering problem such results would be essential for a rigorous justification of the numerical observations consider the 1 d scalar helmholtz equation x k k 2 1 q x x k 0 1 where the real valued 1 q x is the refractive index of the medium for any real number k we look for a solution of the form x k x k e ikx where the scattered wave corresponding to the left excitation e ikx and the right excitation e ikx respectively satisfy the outgoing radiation conditions x k ik x k 0 for x 1 x k ik x k 0 for x 0 the sum of the incident wave and its corresponding scattered wave x k is called the total wave through out it is assumed that the medium function q x has the regularity cm 10 0 1 with m 4 and satisfies 1 q x n 0 for x r 2 with n 0 0 1 a fixed constant the scattered wave x k satisfies the helmholtz equation x k k 2 1 q x x k k 2 q x e ikx 3 for all x 0 1 date march 31 2020 1 http arxiv org abs 2002 09242 v 2 2 gang bao and faouzi triki since q x vanishes outside 0 1 it is easy to see that for k r there exist complex numbers known as the reflection coefficients such that x k k e ikx for x 0 x k k e ikx for x 1 4 the existence and uniqueness of the solutions c 0 1 are well known for any real k 8 therefore the function k k are well defined on r the outgoing radiation conditions imply x k 1 k e ikx for x 1 x k 0 k e ikx for x 0 furthermore the constants 1 k and 0 k are nonzero if they are zero then cauchy theorem implies that x k 0 for all x r which means that e ikx on the whole space this is in contradiction with the outgoing radiation conditions in fact x k 6 0 holds for all x r and for all k c satisfying im k 0 corollary 4 1 14 the multifrequency inverse medium problem may be stated as follows given one of the reflection coefficients k and k for k 0 k 0 to reconstruct the refractive index 1 q x for x 0 1 define the impedance functions p x k associated with x k respectively by p x k x k ik x k 5 it is shown in 14 that these functions are well defined and verify in addition the nonlinear ricatti equation p x k ikp 2 x k ik 1 q x 6 subject to the boundary conditions p 0 k 1 p 1 k d k p 0 k d k p 1 k 1 7 for all x 0 1 k r where d k 1 k 1 k 8 the inverse problem may be restated as given the data d k k 0 k 0 or d k k 0 k 0 to reconstruct the medium function q x for x 0 1 it is well known that in the case where the data is given for all frequencies this inverse problem has a unique solution and a number of algorithms have been proposed for its numerical treatment 29 however in applications the reflection coefficients k are usually measured with finite accuracy at a finite number of the frequencies k hence the well posedness of the inverse problem when the measurements are taken over a finite interval is of critical importance it is well known that the ill posedness of the inverse scattering problem decreases as the frequency increases 3 however at high frequencies the nonlinear equation becomes extremely oscillatory and possesses many more local minima a challenge for solving this problem is to develop a solution method that takes advantages of the regularity of the problem for high frequencies without being undermined by local minima to overcome the difficulties a recursive linearization method was proposed in 14 15 13 for solving the inverse problem of the two dimensional helmholtz equation based on the riccati equations for the scattering matrices the method requires full aperture data and needs to solve a sensitivity matrix equation at each iteration the numerical results were very successful to inverse medium 3 address the ill posedness computationally however there are two serious issues remain to be resolved due to the high computational cost it is numerically difficult to extend the method to the three dimensional problems recently new and more efficient recursive linearization methods have been developed for solving the two dimensional helmholtz equation and the three dimensional maxwell equations for both full and limited aperture data by directly using the differential equation formulation 11 6 5 7 theoretically little is known about the stability for the inverse problem with multiple frequency data our main objective of this work is to establish stability estimates for the inverse problem with multiple frequency data we state here our first main result associated to the inversion with boundary measurements on a band of frequencies for m 4 m 0 and q 0 cm 10 0 1 satisfying 2 we further denote the set q q n 0 m m by q q cm 10 0 1 q q 0 cm 1 0 1 m n 0 1 q 9 we next give our first main stability estimate for the multifrequency inverse medium problem in what follows cq and kq denote generic strictly positives constants depending only on q theorem 1 1 assume that q q be two medium functions in q let d d and d d be the boundary measurements associated respectively to q and q as defined in 7 satisfying d d l 0 1 let k r be the smallest value satisfying d k d k d d l 0 then there exist constants cq 0 and nq n such that the following estimate holds q q l r cq d d m m 1 w 0 k k 0 l 0 k 0 10 for all k 0 0 where the function w 0 k k 0 is continuous on r 2 and verifies 2 arctan ek 0 1 nq ek 1 2 nq ek 0 1 2 nq w 0 k k 0 2 arctan inf k 0 k 2 k 20 ek 0 nq e 2 k nq e 2 k 0 nq for all k 0 0 k remark 1 1 the ho lder exponent m m 1 w 0 k k 0 in the estimate 10 is an increasing function of k 0 it tends to zero when k 0 goes to zero which shows as expected that the ill posedness of the inversion in creases when the band of frequency shrinks on the other hand the function w 0 k k 0 approaches to its upper bound m m 1 when k 0 tends to k which is the global ho lder stability estimate obtained in corollary 3 1 the value k represents the frequency at which the noise is the most important we observe that the ho lder exponent m m 1 w 0 k k 0 is a decreasing function of k and tends to zero when k approaches by considering the stability estimate 10 we conclude that the reconstruction of the medium function is accurate when the frequency band is large enough and contains the noise frequency k 0 k 0 while it deteriorates when the frequency band shrinks toward zero these theoretical results confirm the numerical observations and the physical expectations for the increasing stability phenomena by taking multifrequency data theorem 1 2 assume that q q be two medium functions in q let d d and d d be the boundary measurements associated respectively to q and q as defined in 7 satisfying d d l 0 1 then there exist constants cq 0 kq 0 and nq n such that the following estimates hold q q l r cq m m 1 if k 0 kq 1 m 11 q q l r cq ln k 0 ln m 2 m 1 if k 0 kq 1 m 12 4 gang bao and faouzi triki where the function is given by k 0 ek 0 1 nq 1 2 1 ek 0 1 2 nq remark 1 2 the estimates 11 and 12 show that the stability is ho lder when the largest value in the frequency band k 0 is larger than a critical limit and is of logarithmic type when k 0 becomes small hence for a limited band of frequencies one can improve the stability of the inverse problem by increasing the largest frequency the critical limit only depends on the noise in the measurement and the set of medium functions q when k 0 tends to zero the function k 0 approaches zero and right hand side term blows up this behavior demonstrate again that the inverse problem is severely ill posed when k 0 is close to zero and confirms the observations made in remark 1 1 based on the high frequency asymptotic expansions of the fields chen and rokhlin 14 introduced the observable part of the medium q x on the band of frequency 0 k 0 as the function qk 0 x unique solution to the truncated version of the trace formula 42 that is p k 0 x k ikp 2 k 0 x k ik 1 q x 0 13 q x 2 1 q x k 0 k 0 pk 0 x k pk 0 x k dk 0 14 for all x 0 1 subject to the boundary conditions pk 0 0 k d k pk 0 0 k 1 qk 0 0 0 15 for all k c they also have derived error estimates of the approximation of the medium function q x by its observable part qk 0 x on the frequency band 0 k 0 14 our third main result is to characterize qk 0 x in terms of the frequency band 0 k 0 and to show that the recovery of qk 0 x is not sensitive to errors in the measurements if k 0 is large enough theorem 1 3 assume that q q be two medium functions in q let d d and d d be the boundary measurements associated respectively to q and q as defined in 7 let qk 0 and q k 0 be the observable parts of respectively q and q on 0 k 0 solutions to the system 13 14 15 then there exist constants q 0 and kq 0 such that qk 0 q k 0 l r q d k d k l 1 0 k 0 is satisfied for all k 0 kq for higher dimension to the best of our knowledge this inverse problem is still open this is due to the difficulties in the analysis of the scattering data as a function of the frequency which are related to the strong nonlinearity for high frequencies and the existence of trapped rays from a physical point of view the situation is better understood according to uncertainty principle there exists a resolution limit to the sharpness of details of the medium that can be observed from measurements in the far field region this limit known as the diffraction limit is about one half of the wavelength consequently the reconstruction of the medium can be then reduced by increasing the magnitude of the frequency 12 mathematically the inverse medium problem with full measurements at a fixed frequency is notoriously ill posed 28 36 in fact alessandrini proved that the stability estimates in 3 d is of logarithmic type 2 and mandache showed later the optimality of such estimates 30 recent studies have been conducted on the behavior of the constant in the logarithmic stability in terms of the fixed frequency 3 24 32 several other results in inverse scattering problems that are related to the increasing stability phenomena by increasing the frequency were obtained in different settings 1 4 24 34 all of these results demonstrate the increasing stability phenomena when the frequency becomes larger for the case of the inverse source problem for helmholtz equation and an homogeneous background it was shown in 8 9 10 16 26 27 that the ill posedness of the inverse problem decreases as the frequency increases convergence results for iterative algorithms solving the multi frequency inverse medium 5 inverse medium problem are obtained in 12 23 finally we refer the reader to the topical review on inverse scattering problems 7 with multifrequencies on other related topics the rest of the paper is structured as follows auxiliary results related to the behavior of the impedance functions as functions of the frequency are provided in section 2 the stability estimate for the observ able part of the medium is given in section 3 finally the proof of the main stability estimates for the multifrequency inverse medium problem is provided in sections 4 and 5 2 properties of the impedance functions a major difficulty in studying the multifrequency inverse medium problem is the fact that the partial dif ferential equation describing the scattering phenomena involves a product of the frequency and the refractive index in the 1 d case gel fand levitan techniques can be employed when the medium function is smooth to convert the helmholtz equation into a schro dinger equation in the obtained schro dinger equation the frequency and the refractive index are separated which allows a better understanding of the behavior of the solutions as functions of the frequency this approach was used to study the 1 d inverse spectral problem 37 it also led the authors in 14 to derive high frequency asymptotic expansions of the impedance functions here we first present some of these useful asymptotic results and our further analysis in addition we also study the meromorphic extensions of the impedance functions to the lower half complex plane for convenience we complexify k denote c the upper half and lower half of the complex plane that is c k c im k 0 c k c im k 0 it is easy to check from the uniqueness of the equations 6 with the boundary conditions 7 that p x k p x k 16 for all x r and k c low frequency behavior we next present the behavior of the impedances functions when the frequency k is close to 0 in lemma 4 1 and 4 2 of 13 the author derived the first term in the asymptotic expansion p when k approaches 0 here we provide explicit bounds in a given frequency neighborhood of 0 proposition 2 1 the following estimate d k 2 holds for all k c satisfying k 1 m 1 with m 1 2 q 0 l 0 1 m 17 proof since the proofs of the estimates for d and d are identical we only provide the proof for d let g 0 x y e ik x y 2 ik be the green function of the one dimension helmholtz equation with the same radiation conditions as multiplying the equation 3 by g 0 x y and integrating by parts yield the following lippmann schwinger integral equation id kq kq e ik 18 where id is the identity operator from l 0 1 to itself and kq is a linear integral operator on l 0 1 defined by kq x k 2 1 0 g 0 x y q y y 6 gang bao and faouzi triki for all l 0 1 therefore for 2 k q 0 l 0 1 m 1 the operator kq becomes a contraction and we deduce from the convergence of the neumann series k l 0 1 1 3 hence d k 2 for k 1 m 1 which finishes the proof remark 2 1 born approximation using the neumann series and after a forward calculation we obtain k k 2 i f q 2 k p 2 ik 2 p 0 1 p eik p qp d for all k 0 k 0 where k 0 1 m 1 p 1 p 1 l 1 l 1 l p for all rp and qp p j 1 q j since the first term in the low frequency expansion is the fourier transform f q 2 k k k 0 k 0 it seems natural to try to reconstruct the medium function from this term by considering the rest as a small perturbation o k 20 and by using the same techniques as in 8 it turns out that this approach fails to give any approximation of the medium function the born approximation error o k 20 is a higher order differential operator that is exponentially amplified in the inversion of the first term and the final term does not vanish when k 0 tends to zero high frequency behavior the following result was obtained in 14 proposition 2 2 assume that q q the impedances p x k are continuous functions of x k 0 1 c and analytic functions of k c moreover there exists a constant cq 0 such that the following estimates p x k 1 q x q x 4 i 1 q x 1 k l cq k 2 19 p x k p x k l cq k m 20 hold for all k c we remark that the estimate 19 provides the two first terms in wkb expansions of the functions p for large real k the difference between p and p is extremely small which decays as 1 k m where m is the smoothness of the medium q x meromorphic extension it is known that the impedance functions p x k and in particular the re flexion coefficients k are holomorphic in c and have meromorphic extensions in c the poles of are called the scattering resonances of the medium here we establish the existence of a scattering resonances free strip in the complex plane the proof is based on a similar result for the 1 d schro dinger equation derived in 22 from 1 it follows that the poles can be characterized in the following way k c is a scattering pole if and only if there exists a nontrivial function such that x k k 2 1 q x x k 0 x 0 1 21 with 0 k ik 0 k 1 ik 1 k 22 we now present a connection between the solution of the helmholtz equation 21 and the one of an equiv alent schro dinger equation this will allow us to relate our scattering resonances to the well studied poles of the resolvent of the schro dinger operator this approach has been also used to derive the high frequency inverse medium 7 asymptotic expansions in theorem 2 2 define further the functions n x n r r r by the following expressions n x 1 q x t x x 0 n s ds n t n x t 1 4 23 r t n t n t n x 2 n x 2 1 4 n 4 x q x nq x 5 4 n 1 q x 2 24 then t k defined by the liouville transformation t k n 1 t x t k satisfies the schro dinger equation t k r t k 2 t k 0 x 0 t 25 with 0 k 1 k 26 where t t 1 1 0 n s ds is the the travel time needed for the wave with speed 1 n to propagate from one end to another we remark that r t has a compact support in 0 t consequently k is a scattering resonance of 21 22 iff it is a resonance of the system 25 26 the pole distribution of the resolvent for the schro dinger operator has been the subject of extensive investigations due to the continuous advance of quantum mechanics many studies have focused on the problem of locating poles in the complex plane for different classes of potentials 18 21 38 17 for the one dimensional schro dinger operator with super exponentially decaying potentials more precise results are possible particularly using the representation of the scattering matrix given by melin 31 hitrik 22 derived an explicit pole free strip for the schro dinger operator in the case of compactly supported potentials the following result is a direct consequence of hitrik s result and the observation that scattering resonances of the system 21 22 are also the poles of the schro dinger operator 25 26 proposition 2 3 let r r r be defined by 24 and h r 1 4 t e 2 t r l 1 0 t then the strip sq k c h r im k 0 re k 6 0 27 is free from scattering resonances of the system 21 22 corollary 2 1 let cq 1 maxq q n x l and cq 2 maxq q r t l then it follows from propo sition 2 3 that the strip of width hq 1 1 4 cq 1 e 2 c 2 q 1 cq 2 defined by s q k c hq 1 im k 0 re k 6 0 28 is free from scattering resonances of 21 22 for all q q we also deduce from proposition 2 3 and proposition 2 1 that the coefficients d k have holomorphic extensions in the strip sq defined by sq k c im k hq 29 where hq min hq 1 1 m 1 we next obtain global bounds of these functions in the strip 8 gang bao and faouzi triki proposition 2 4 there exist constants kq 0 cq 0 dq 0 that only depend on q such that the following inequality hold d k 1 cq re k 2 k sq re k kq 30 d k dq k sq 31 proof since the proofs of the bounds for k and k are identical we only provide the proof for the second scattering coefficient the proof may be given by combining the general idea in the proof of lemma 4 12 in 15 and the meromorphic extension result above applying the liouville transformation to 1 we find that t k n 1 t x t k satisfies the schro dinger equation t k r t k 2 t k 0 t 0 t 32 with t k eikt t 0 33 the impedance function p x k is then given by p x k n x t k ik t k n x 2 ikn x introducing now the auxiliary functions m t k eikt t k and n t k 1 ik e ikt t k a forward calculation yields p x k m t k n t k we deduce from the system 32 33 that m t k satisfies m t k 2 ikm t k r t m t k t 0 t 34 with the initial conditions m 0 k 1

observable part of the medium qk 0 x for k 0 k 0 in this section using the truncated trace formula introduced in 14 we characterize qk 0 x in terms of the frequency band 0 k 0 and study how its determination is sensitive to errors in the measurements the following trace formula is on the asymptotic behavior in proposition 2 2 lemma 3 1 trace formula 14 let q q then the following trace formula holds q x 2 1 q x p x k p x k dk 41 more precisely there exists a constant cq 0 such that the estimate q x 2 1 q x k 0 k 0 p x k p x k dk l r cq km 0 42 holds for all k 0 c the truncated version of the trace formula 42 means that the function 2 k 0 k 0 p x k p x k dk provides a good approximation of log 1 q x as long as k 0 is large and the medium q x is smooth lemma 3 2 let q q then there exist constants cq 0 and kq 0 such that truncated trace formula system 13 14 15 has a unique solution qk 0 in addition the following estimates hold p pk 0 c 0 1 k 0 k 0 q qk 0 l r cq km 0 for all k 0 kq our second main result of this paper is to characterize qk 0 x in terms of the frequency band 0 k 0 and to show that the recovery of qk 0 x is not sensitive to errors in the measurements we are now ready to give the proof of theorem 1 3 10 gang bao and faouzi triki proof let pk 0 x k and p k 0 x k be the impedance functions solutions to the system 13 14 15 related respectively to the observable mediums qk 0 and q k 0 to simplify the notation we introduce the impedance perturbations u x k pk 0 x k p k 0 x k due to the measurements difference on the boundary k d k d k then u x k qk

conditions as in theorem 1 3 there exist constants cq 0 and kq 0 such that k r t k 0 cq for all r t 0 1 and k 0 kq proof lemma 3 3 first we remark from the uniqueness of solution to the system 13 14 15 that pk 0 like the impedance function p x k satisfies pk 0 x k pk 0 x k inverse medium 11 for all x 0 1 then by a change of variables k k we obtain k 0 k 0 ke ik r t pk 0 k p k 0 k d dk k 0 k 0 keik r t pk 0 k p k 0 k d dk hence k can be rewritten as k r t k 0 k 0 k 0 k eik r t pk 0 k p k 0 k d eik r t pk 0 k p k 0 k d dk now let k be defined as follows k r t k 0 k 0 k 0 k eik r t p k p k d eik r t p k p k d dk according to lemma 3 2 there the integrand of k r t k 0 k r t k 0 decays like 1 k m 1 0 uniformly with respect to r t 0 1 therefore there exist constants cq 0 and kq 0 such that k

all t r 0 1 and k 0 kq combining the previous inequalities we finally obtain that k r t k 0 is uni formly bounded over 0 1 2 for all k 0 kq which finishes the proof of the lemma back to the equation

that is there exist a constant kq 0 such that n 0 2 1 qk 0 x 1 q k 0 2 n 0 for all x 0 1 and k 0 kq therefore q x 1 2 n 0 log 1 qk 0 1 q k 0 for all x 0 1 combining the last inequality with 49 gives q

x r and k 0 kq which finishes the proof of the theorem 1 3 remark 3 1 the estimate of theorem 1 3 provides a basis for excellent numerical results to reconstruct the observable part of the medium in addition it is an integral part of the proof of theorem 1 1 now we go back to the proof of the main theorems lemma 3 2 implies that if k 0 is large enough we have the existence of qk 0 and q k 0 by splitting the difference q q into three parts we have q q l 0 1 q qk 0 l 0 1 qk 0 q k 0 l 0 1 q q k 0 l 0 1 using now the results of lemma 3 2 and theorem 1 3 to estimate each part of the right hand side we finish the proof of theorem 1 1 theorem 3 1 assume that q q be two medium functions in q let d k and d k be the boundary measurements associated respectively to q and q as defined in 7 then there exist constants cq 0 and kq such that q q l r cq d d l 1 0 k 0 1 km 0 51 for all k 0 kq obviously this result implies the uniqueness of the multi frequency inverse medium and a conditional lipschitz stability estimate when the band of frequency is large enough corollary 3 1 assume that q q be two medium functions in q let d k and d k be the boundary measurements associated respectively to q and q as defined in 7 satisfying d d l 0 1 then there exists a constant cq 0 such that the following lipschitz stability q q l r cq d k d k m m 1 l 0 holds proof under the same assumptions of theorem 3 1 we have q q l r cq k 0 d d l 0 k 0 1 km 0 52 for all k 0 skq with s 1 by taking s d d 1 m 1 l 0 k 0 we get the wanted estimate remark 3 2 the estimate 51 has two parts the first is lipschitz in terms of the errors in measurements and the second decays as the size of the frequency interval takes larger values clearly this shows that as the frequency increases a conditional ho lder stability in l norm can be reached as illustrated in corollary 3 1 inverse medium 13 4 proof of theorem 1 1 in this section we prove the stability estimate 10 we first provide the following conditional stability estimate for the unique continuation of d on a line theorem 4 1 let k 0 0 d and d be the impedance coefficients given in 7 for respectively q and q in q then the following estimate hold d d k 2 dq d d w 0 k k 0 l 0 k 0 53 for all k k 0 where d is the constant appearing in proposition 2 4 proof we deduce from proposition 2 4 that d k d k 2 dq 54 for all k sq without loss of generality we can assume that hq 2 nq where nq n let shq k c re k 0 im k hq be half a strip and et w 0 k k 0 be the harmonic measure of the complex open domain shq 0 k 0 0 it is the unique solution to the system w k k 0 0 k shq 0 k 0 0 w k k 0 0 k shq w k k 0 1 k 0 k 0 0 the holomorphic unique continuation of the functions d d using the two constants theorem 25 33 gives d d l 0 k 2 dq 1 w 0 k k

deduce from theorem 4 1 the following estimate d d l 0 d k d k 2 dq d d w 0 k k 0 l 0 k 0 considering the global stability estimate in corollary 3 1 we obtain q q l r cq d d m m 1 l 0 2 cqdq d d m m 1 w 0 k k 0 l 0 k 0 which finishes the proof of the theorem 5 proof of theorem 1 2 in this section we prove the stability estimates 11 12 we start by deriving a lower bound to the harmonic measure w 0 on r proposition 5 1 the harmonic measure w 0 k k 0 satisfies w 0 k k 0 6 k 0 e nqk 14 gang bao and faouzi triki proof it is known in the literature that the following inequality 35 arctan x 3 x holds for all x 0 where x x 1 2 1 x 2 hence 2 arctan ek 0 1 nq ek 1 2 nq ek 0 1 2 nq 2 arctan ek 0 1 nqe nqk 6 k 0 e nqk where k 0 e k 0 1 nq we deduce from proposition 2 2 that d k d k d k 1 d k 1 cq km 55 for all k r with cq 2 dq theorem 4 1 and the last inequality lead to d k d k min 2 dq w 0 k k 0 cq km for all k r now we consider the two following cases case 1 assume that cq 1 km 0 holds hence d d l 0 is satisfied and we immediately get the first stability estimate 11 case 2 assume that cq km 0 holds due to the monotonicity of the functions w 0 k 1 k 0 and 1 km there exists a unique k 1 k 0 satisfying cq km 1 2 dq w 0 k 1 k 0 56 and d d l 0 cq km 1 57 since 0 1 and cq 2 dq we have k 1 1 on the other hand combining 56 and proposition 5 1 gives cq km 1 6 k 0 e nqk which in turn leads to enqk 1 ln 2 dq ln cq m ln k 1 6 k 0 ln since cq 2 dq and k 1 1 we deduce from the last inequality the existence of cq 0 such that ecqk 1 k 0 ln inverse medium 15 holds hence k 1 cq ln k 0 ln combining now the last inequality and estimate 57 we find d d l 0 cq ln k 0 ln m by corollary 3 1 and the last inequality we obtain the desired stability estimate 12 with kq c m m 1 q 6 appendix we first recall the gornwall s inequality lemma 6 1 assume that u v and w 0 1 r are continuous functions satisfying the inequality u x v x x 0 u t w t dt for all x 0 1 then u x v x x 0 v t w t e x t w d dt we next give upper and lower estimates of a harmonic measure in a complex strip containing a slit lemma 6 2 fix n n and let h 2 n k 0 0 be two fixed real constants sh k c re k 0 im k h be half a strip denote w 0 k k 0 the harmonic measure of sh 0 k 0 0 then 2 arctan ek 0 1 n ek 1 2 n ek 0 1 2 n w 0 k k 0 2 arctan inf k 0 k 2 k 20 ek 0 n e 2 kn e 2 k 0 n for all k k 0 proof for n n denote by wn k k 0 the harmonic measure of 0 k 0 0 in the sector s 2 n k c arg k 2 n let n k k 0 k 2 n k 2 n 0 be the conformal mapping of the domain s 2 n 0 k 0 0 onto the right half plane s 2 here k is the principal branch of square root function on c 0 satisfying 1 1 the parts of the boundary 0 k 0 0 are then mapped onto ikn 0 ikn 0 now define w z kn 0 to be the harmonic measure of the right half plane s 2 ik n 0 ik n 0 the explicit expression of w is well known 19 w z kn 0 2 arctan kn 0 z for z 0 since wn k k 0 w n k k 0 k n 0 for k s 2 n 0 k 0 0 we also obtain wn k k 0 2 arctan kn 0 k 2 n k 2 n 0 for k k 0 58 let 1 k e k be the conformal mapping of the domain s 2 n 0 k 0 0 onto the domain s 2 n b 1 0 1 ek 0 0 since w 0 k k 0 wn 1 k 1 k 0 on s 2 n b 1 0 1 ek 0 0 we deduce from the max imum principle w 0 k k 0 2 arctan ek 0 n e 2 kn e 2 k 0 n 59 16 gang bao and faouzi triki for all k k 0 by construction we have s 2 n s 2 and consequently 0 w 0 k k 0 w 2 k k 0 on im k 2 n then again by the maximum principle we obtain w 0 k k 0 w 1 k k 0 2 arctan k 0 k 2 k 20 60 for all k k 0 combining inequalities 59 and 60 we finally find w 0 k k 0 2 arctan inf k 0 k 2 k 20 ek 0 n e 2 kn e 2 k 0 n 61 which gives the right hand side inequality let 2 k e k 1 be the conformal mapping of the domain s n 0 k 0 0 onto the domain dn 0 ek 0 1 0 where dn z c z 1 s 2 n re z 1 0 then w 0 1 2 k k 0 is the harmonic measure of 0 ek 0 1 0 in the domain dn now since 0 ek 0 1 0 s 2 n dn we have 0 wn k k 0 w 0 1 2 k k 0 on s 2 n the maximum principle implies that wn k e k 0 1 w 0 1 2 k k 0 holds on s 2 n and particularly we have 2 arctan ek 0 1 n k 2 n ek 0 1 2 n w 0 1 2 k k 0 for all k ek 0 1 or equivalently 2 arctan ek 0 1 n ek 1 2 n ek 0 1 2 n w 0 k k 0 for all k k 0 62 which provides the desired left
