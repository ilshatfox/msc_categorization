quenching 1 introduction in this paper we study the quenching behavior of the following nonlinear heat equation with singular boundary conditions u t ux r 2 ux x 0 x a 0 t t ux 0 t u p 0 t ux a t 1 u a t q 0 t t u x 0 u 0 x 0 x a 1 1 where s is an appropriately smooth and strictly monotone increasing func tion with 0 0 1 1 and s 0 p q are positive constants r 2 and t and the initial function u 0 x is a non negative smooth function preprint submitted to elsevier july 10 2019 http arxiv org abs 1907 03796 v 1 satisfying the compatibility conditions u 0 0 u p 0 0 u 0 a 1 u 0 a q in the case u u 1 m 0 m 1 eq 1 1 is known as the classical non newtonian filtration equation that attempts to model non stationary fluid flow through a porous medium where the tangential stress of the fluid s displacement velocity u has a power dependence under thermodynamic ex pansion and compression as a result of heat transfer 12 13 19 the sin gular boundary flux terms represent a nonlinear radiation law at the bound ary and is common to polytropic filtration equations 11 12 13 19 this mathematical model may exhibit finite time quenching defined as a time t t u 0 such that lim t t min u x t 0 x a 0 or lim t t max u x t 0 x a 1 in the following the quenching time of eq 1 1 is denoted as t as is well known when u u and r 2 the equations reduce to the heat equation in 15 selcuk and ozalp considered the problem ut uxx 0 x a 0 t t ux 0 t u p 0 t ux a t 1 u a t q 0 t t u x 0 u 0 x 0 x a 1 2 it shown that if u 0 satisfies uxx x 0 0 then lim t t u 0 t 0 and ut 0 t blows up in finite time and the quenching location is at x 0 likewise it was shown that if u 0 satisfies uxx x 0 0 then quenching will occur at x a in this paper new estimates are derived for quenching rates in addi tion we provide necessary conditions that guarantee quenching at one of the boundary locations for a more general u and r 2 in the following the initial condition may satisfy either of the two condi tions uxx x 0 0 0 x a or 1 3 uxx x 0 0 0 x a 1 4 and the following condition ux x 0 0 0 x a 1 5 2 these assumptions will be shown to guarantee that quenching will occur in finite time quenching problems have a long history in applied mathematics litera ture dating back to pioneering work of kawarada 10 which examines the one dimensional heat equation with a nonlinear source term with dirichlet boundary conditions the kawarada equations and extensions have been a subject of interest of both numerical 1 8 16 and theoretical 6 7 5 14 18 20 in many situations the location that quenching occurs may be difficult to obtain here the situation of a singular boundary condition enables the oretical predications to happen since the quenching location is known based on simple requirements on the initial conditions chan and yuen 5 investigated a slightly different left boundary condi tion ut uxx in ux 0 t 1 u 0 t p ux a t 1 u a t q 0 t t u x 0 u 0 x 0 u 0 x 1 in d where a p q 0 t d 0 a d 0 t in 5 they showed that x a is the unique quenching point in finite time if u 0 is a lower solution and ut blows up at quenching time in 14 selcuk and ozalp considered the problem ut uxx 1 u p 0 x 1 0 t t ux 0 t

that ut blows up at quenching time furthermore they ob tained a quenching rate and a lower bound for the quenching time in 12 li and et al considered the quenching problem for non newtonian filtration equation with a singular boundary condition u t ux r 2 ux x 0 x 1 0 t t ux 0 t 0 ux 1 t g u 1 t 0 t t u x 0 u 0 x 0 x 1 1 6 where u is a monotone increasing function with 0 0 p 1 g u 0 g u 0 for u 0 and limu 0 g u they showed that x 1 is the only quenching point in finite time under proper conditions further they 3 obtained a quenching rate and gave an example of an application of their results in this paper the quenching problem eq 1 1 exhibits two types of singularity terms the boundary outflux terms u p and 1 u q as eq 1 2 motivated by problems 1 2 and 1 6 we investigate the quenching behavior of eq 1 1 further in such case several questions remain open for eq 1 2 in 15 in particular 1 what are the quenching rates 2 what are the estimated quenching times this paper is arranged as follows in section 2 it will be shown that the solution quenches in finite time t and lim t t u a t or lim t t u a t blows up at quenching time at the only quenching point x a or x 0 under the conditions 1 3 or 1 4 respectively for r 2 in section 3 quenching rates are obtained of the solution near the quenching time for u u and r 2 lower bounds to the are then given section 4 details the development of the finite difference numerical approximation section 4 provides numerical experiments that provide experimental validation to our theoretical results shown in section 3 we highlight our main results in section 4 2 quenching for the non newtonian filtration equation firstly we rewrite eq 1 1 into the following form ut b u ux r 2 ux x 0 x a 0 t t ux 0 t u p 0 t ux a t 1 u a t q 0 t t u x 0 u 0 x 0 x a 2 1 where r 2 b u 1 u and u 6 0 for u 0 lemma 2 1 a assume that 1 5 holds then ux x t 0 in 0 a 0 t 0 b assume that 1 4 holds then ut x t 0 in 0 a 0 t 0 c assume that 1 3 holds then ut x t 0 in 0 a 0 t 0 4 proof a let z x t ux x t then z x t satisfies zt b u z r 2 z xx b u z z r 2 z x 0 x a 0 t t 0 z 0 t u p 0 t z a t 1 u a t q 0 t t 0 z x 0 u 0 x from the maximum principle it follows that z 0 and hence ux x t 0 in 0 a 0 t 0 b let w x t ut x t then w x t satisfies on 0 x a and 0 t t 0 wt b u ux r 2 ux xw r 1 b u ux r 2 wx x and wx 0 t pu p 1 0 t w 0 t 0 t t 0 wx a t q 1 u a t q 1 w a t 0 t t 0 w x 0 b u 0 x u 0 x r 2 u 0 x x 0 x a from the maximum principle it follows that w 0 and hence ut x t 0 in 0 a 0 t 0 c similarly u 0 x assumes 1 3 then from the above proof we have ut x t 0 in 0 a 0 t 0 the proof is complete theorem 2 2 a assume that 1 4 and 1 5 hold then the solution u of eq 2 1 quenches at time t then quenching occurs only at the boundary x 0 and ut 0 t blows up at the quenching time b assume that 1 3 and 1 5 hold then ut x t 0 in 0 a 0 t 0 and there exists a finite time t such that the solution u of eq 2 1 quenches at time t then quenching occurs only at the boundary x a and ut a t blows up at the quenching time proof 5 a assume that 1 4 holds then by lemma 2 1 b we get ut x t 0 in 0 a 0 t 0 in addition by 1 4 3 1 u a 0 q r 1 u p r 1 0 0 0 we shall introduce a mass function m 3 t a 0 u x t dx 0 t t then m 3 t 1 u a t q r 1 u p r 1 0 t 3 by ut x t 0 in 0 a 0 t 0 thus m 3 t m 3 0 3 t which means that m 3 t 0 0 for some t 0 0 t t 0 which means u quenches in finite time since r 2 u is an increasing function ut x t 0 and ux x t 0 in 0 a 0 t 0 we get u t ux r 2 ux x u ut r 1 u r 2 x uxx uxx u ut r 1 ur 2 x 0 namely ux is a decreasing function and since ux a t 1 u a t q 1 ux x t 1 in 0 a 0 t let 0 a integrating this with respect to x from 0 to we have u t u 0 t 0 so u does not quench in 0 a suppose that ut is bounded in 0 a 0 t then there is a positive constant m ut m therefore b u ux r 2 ux x m because of s 0 s is not increasing so there are and which make 0 v 1 in 0 0 t thus b u 1 u b thus ux r 2 ux x m b u m b ur 1 x x m b 6 from ux x t 0 in 0 a 0 t 0 integrating this with respect to x from 0 to a we have 1 u a t r 1 q u r 1 p 0 t ma b as t t the left hand side tends to negative infinity while the right hand side is finite this contradiction shows that ut blows up at the quenching time for x 0 b similarly assume that 1 3 and 1 5 hold from a we have quench ing occurs only at the boundary x a and ut blows up at the quenching time for x a the proof is therefore complete 3 quenching rates of the heat equation in this section we investigate the case where u u and r 2 and determine quenching rates and lower bounds to the quenching time under certain conditions on the initial condition in eq 1 2 in the following we may either assumption on the spatial derivative of the initial condition ux x 0 x a 1 u x 0 q 0 x a or 3 1 ux x 0 a x a u p x 0 0 x a 3 2 theorem 3 1 if u 0 x satisfies condition 1 3 that is the initial condition is not concave down then there exists a positive constant c 1 such that u a t 1 c 1 t t 1 2 q 2 for t sufficiently close to the quenching time t proof define m x t ut q 1 u q 1 ux in 0 a t where 0 t and is a positive constant to be specified later it was shown in 15 that since ut 0 and ux 0 in 0 a 0 t then m x t satisfies mt mxx q q 1 q 2 1 u q 3 u 3 x 2 q q 1 1 u q 2 uxut 0 7 for x t 0 a t furthermore if is small enough thenm x 0 for x 0 a and m 0 t 0 m a t 0 for t t therefore by the maximum principle we obtain that m x t 0 for x t 0 a t this means that ut x t q 1 u q 1 ux x t x t 0 a t evaluating at x a yields ut a t q 1 u a t 2 q 1 integrating over t from t to t gives u a t 1 c 1 t t 1 2 q 2 where c 1 2 q q 1 1 2 q 2 if we provide the additional condition on the spatial derivative of the initial condition then we can obtain a lower bound to the value at the right hand wall this is encapsulated in the following theorem theorem 3 2 if u 0 x satisfies conditions 1 3 and 3 1 then there exist positive constant c 2 such that u a t 1 c 2 t t 1 2 q 2 for t sufficiently close to the quenching time t proof define j x t ux x a 1 u q x t 0 a 0 t then j x t satisfies jt jxx 1 a 2 q 1 u q 1 ux xq q 1 1 u q 2 u 2 x j x t cannot attain a negative interior minimum since ux x t 0 on the other hand by our condition 3 1 we have j x 0 0 and j 0 t u p 0 t 0 j a t 0 8 for a 1 and t 0 t by the maximum principle we obtain that j x t 0 for x t 0 1 0 t therefore jx a t lim h 0 j a t j a h t h lim h 0 j a h t h 0 subsequently jx a t uxx a t 1 a 1 u a t q q 1 u a t 2 q 1 ut a t 1 a 1 u a t q q 1 u a t 2 q 1 0 and ut a t qa 1 a 1 u a t 2 q 1 integrating over t from t to t yields u a t 1 c 2 t t 1 2 q 2 where c 2 qa 1 2 q 2 a 1 2 q 2 corollary 3 1 the results of the theorems 3 1 and 3 2 suggest as the quenching time is approached that the quenching rate of the solution can be estimated as u a t 1 t t 1 2 q 1 equivalently ln 1 u a t ln t t 1 2 q 1 in addition a lower bound for the quenching time can be calculated from theorem 3 2 we have tq a 1 u 0 a 2 q 2 2 qa 1 q 1 t in the following we assume the initial condition satisfies condition 1 4 this condition guarantees quenching will occur at the left boundary x 0 hence we seek quenching estimates to the quenching rate of the solution 9 theorem 3 3 if u 0 x satisfies condition 1 4 that is the initial condition is not concave up then there exists a positive constant c 3 such that u 0 t c 3 t t 1 2 p 2 for t sufficiently close to the quenching time t proof define m x t ut pu p 1 ux x t 0 a t where 0 t and is a positive constant to be specified later it was shown in 15 that since ut 0 and ux 0 in 0 a 0 t then m x t satisfies mt mxx p p 1 p 2 u p 3 u 3 x 2 p p 1 u p 2 uxut 0 for x t 0 a t furthermore if is small enough thenm x 0 for x 0 a and m 0 t 0 m a t 0 for t t therefore by the maximum principle we obtain that m x t 0 for x t 0 a t subsequently ut x t pu p 1 ux x t for x t 0 a t this means at x 0 we have ut 0 t pu 2 p 1 0 t integrating over t from t to t yields u 0 t c 3 t t 1 2 p 2 where c 3 2 p p 1 1 2 p 2 theorem 3 4 if u 0 x satisfies both 1 3 and 3 2 then there exist positive constant c 4 such that u 0 t c 4 t t 1 2 p 2 for t sufficiently close to the quenching time t proof define j x t ux a x

then j x 0 0 and j 0 t 0 j a t 1 u a t q 0 for t 0 t therefore by the maximum principle we obtain that j x t 0 for x t 0 1 0 t as a result jx 0 t lim h 0 j h t j 0 t h lim h 0 j h t h 0 this yields jx

3 2 the results of the theorems 3 3 and 3 4 suggest as the quenching time is approached that the quenching rate of the solution is esti mated as u 0 t t t 1 2 p 2 equivalently ln u 0 t ln t t 1 2 p 1 in addition a lower bound for the quenching time is established from theorem 3 4 namely tp au 0 0 2 p 2 2 pa 1 p 1 t for quenching time t 11 3 1 initial conditions examples it is clear that the estimates for the quenching rates and times rely heav ily on properties of the initial condition here we provide initial functions that satisfy the boundary conditions while simultaneously satisfying either conditions 1 3 and 3 1 or 1 4 and 3 2 consider the initial condition u 0 x 1 4 4 x 4 x 2 0 x a 3 3 where a 1 8 let p 1 and q log 16 3 5 since the initial condition is concave up throughout its entire domain then clearly condition 1 3 is satis fied in addition a straightforward calculation shows that the left boundary condition is satisfied namely u 0 0 4 1 u 0 0 p at the right boundary we have u 0 1 8 5 and 1 1 u 0 1 8 q 16 3 q 5 in fig 1 a it is seen that the condition 3 1 is satisfied in light of the initial condition 3 3 then by corollary 3 1 we have a lower bound to quenching time namely tq 3 16 2 q 2 16 1 8 q 1 q 1 4 0002 10 5 similarly if the initial condition is u 0 x 1 4 4 x 2 x 2 0 x a 3 4 where a 1 8 let p 1 and q log 32 9 7 2 since the initial condition is concave down throughout its entire domain then clearly condition 1 4 is satisfied it is clear that the left boundary condition is satisfied at the right boundary we have u 0 1 8 1 u 0 1 8 q 7 2 in fig 1 b we see that condition 3 2 is satisfied furthermore by corollary 3 2 we have a lower bound to quenching time namely tp 1 9216 1 0851 10 5 12 0 0 02 0 04 0 06 0 08 0 1 0 12 x 0 0 5 1 1 5 2 2 5 3 3 5 4 4 5 5 y

u 0 x x a 1 u 0 x q is satisfied throughout the domain 0 x 1 8 b a graph of u 0 x red and a x a u 0 x p blue for u 0 x 1 4 4 x 2 x 2 it is clear that u 0 x a x a u 0 x p is satisfied throughout the domain 0 x 1 8 4 numerical approximation and experiments let xj jh for j 0 n 1 and h a n 1 let tk tk 1 k 1 where k 1 is the temporal step let uj t be the approximation to u xj t define the vector u t u 0 t u 1 t un t un 1 t where u 0 is created from evaluating the initial condition at the grid points central dif ference approximations are utilized at each grid point to create the semidis cretized equations approximating eq 1 2 namely h 2 u t f u t 4 1 where f f 0 fn 1 with components defined as fk 2 u 1 2 h u 0 p 2 u 0 k 0 uk 1 2 uk uk 1 k 1 2 n 2 un 2 h 1 un 1 q 2 un 1 k n 1 4 2 define vm as the approximation to u t at time t tm then the solution is advanced through a second order accurate crank nicolson scheme 17 vm 1 vm m f vm 1 f vm 4 3 13 where m m 2 h 2 the scheme is overall second order accurate however due to the singular boundary conditions the equations are stiff and it is known that unless k is sufficiently then the method may manifest a reduction in the order of temporal convergence 9 with this in mind we expect the method to overall first order accurate modest temporal steps it is common to approximate vm 1 in the right hand side by a first order euler approximation vm 1 vm 2 m f vm this maintains the overall accuracy of the scheme will creating a semi explicit scheme for efficiency in computations 2 the spatial grid is fixed throughout the computation however adaptation may occur in the temporal step temporal adaption for quenching problems is critical to ensure accuracy in the quenching time an arc length monitoring function for u is used to adapt the temporal step define mi ui t t 1 2 ui t 2 2 x t 0 a 0 t for i 0 n 1 the monitoring functions mi monitor the arc length of the characteristic at node xi subsequently as quenching is approached the temporal derivative grows beyond exponentially fast therefore the arc length will grow 3 therefore we choose the temporal step such that the maximal arc length between successive approximations at tk 2 tk 1 and tk 1 tk are equivalent pragmatically this leads to the equation for the temporal step 2 k 2 k 1 min i ui t k 1 ui t k 2 2 ui t k ui t k 1 2 for k 2 and given the initial times steps of 0 and 1 in the following experiments we look to verify the second order conver gence rate of the numerical routine assume that t t let v be the ap proximation to u for a fixed temporal step then the maximum absolute difference between the numerical solution and u at time is max v u c p where c is some positive constant and p is the order of accuracy of the tem poral scheme consider creating a new approximation with a temporal step 2 then at each grid point v 2 u i c h 2 p chp 2 p v u i 2 p 14 for i 0 n 1 rearranging yields an expression to estimate the order of accuracy p 1 ln 2 ln v u i v 2 u i this generates an approximate convergence rate at each grid point xi in the majority of applications u is unknown hence a numerical solution with a relatively fine temporal step is used to estimate the rate of the underlying cauchy sequence 4 consider the initial condition eq 3 3 where a 1 8 p 1 and q log 16 3 5 we choose 10 4 and h 01 in such case we estimate the convergence rate of 1 013 therefore a reduction in the temporal order of convergence is manifested to estimate the quenching time and rates we run the simulation with h 001 and 0 1 10 6 we adapt the temporal step but require k 10 9 the quenching time is numerically determined to be approximately t 1 9037 10 3 which is greater than our estimated lower bound of 4 10 5 a loglog plot of 1 u 1 8 t versus t t is shown in fig 2 a

p 1 15 next consider the initial condition eq 3 4 where a 1 8 p 1 and q log 32 9 7 2 again we run the simulation with h 001 and 0 1 10 6 we adapt the temporal step but require k 10 9 the quenching time is numerically determined to be approximately t 10 3 which is greater than our estimated lower bound of 1 0851 10 5 a loglog plot of u 0 t versus t t is shown in fig 2 b a least squares approximation suggests a slope of approximately 0 244301262418202 the theoretical estimate was predicated to be 0 25 5 conclusions in this paper a quenching problem with nonlinear boundary conditions are investigated certain conditions on the positivity concavity and the first derivative of the initial condition lead to theoretical lower bound to the quenching time in addition to asymptotic estimates to the quenching rate numerical experiments provided additional validation of the pragmatic appli cation of the theoretical analysis we found that the experimental quenching time t was later than our predicted lower bound further the experiments suggested quenching rates that were within 1 of the predicted asymptotic quenching rates references 1 beauregard m a numerical solutions to
