altenbergerstrasse 69 a 4040 linz austria abstract it is well known that the presence in a homogeneous acoustic medium of a small inhomogeneity of size enjoying a high contrast of both its mass density and bulk modulus amplifies the generated total fields this amplification is more pronounced when the incident frequency is close to the minnaert frequency m here we explain the origin of such a phenomenon at first we show that the scattering of an incident wave of frequency is described by a self adjoint dependent schro dinger operator with a singular like potential supported at the inhomogeneity interface then we show that in the low energy regime corresponding in our setting to 1 such an operator has a non trivial limit i e it asymptotically differs from the laplacian if and only if m the limit operator describing the non trivial scattering process is explicitly determined and belongs to the class of point perturbations of the laplacian when the frequency of the incident wave approaches m the scattering process undergoes a transition between an asymptotically trivial behaviour and a non trivial one 1 introduction models related to the wave propagation in the presence of small scaled but highly contrasted inhomogeneities appear in different areas of applied sciences as in acoustics electromagnetism and elasticity where these inho mogeneities model micro bubbles nano particles and micro or nano inclusions respectively there is a critical ratio between the size and the contrast of the inhomogeneities under which the generated fields can be drastically enhanced this enhancement has tremendous applications in imaging in the broad sense and material sciences to cite a few it has been observed and quantified in the stationary regimes for certain values of the incident frequencies see e g 16 which are referred to as resonances the purpose of our work is understanding the origin of such particular frequencies enlightening the mechanism which leads to their emergence to study this question we consider the stationary acoustic wave propagation in the presence of micro bubbles we deal with a linear model described by the mass density and the bulk modulus see 12 13 when the background medium is homogeneous with constant mass density 0 and bulk modulus k 0 and the micro bubble has shape with diameter of about few tens of micrometers mass density and bulk modulus k then the resonant frequencies are expected to appear in the following asymptotic regimes low density low bulk bubble characterized by the small behaviour 0 k k 0 r with r 0 in this regime the relative speed of propagation c 2 c 2 0 k 0 k 0 1 is moderate but the contrast of the transmission coefficient is large as 1 moderate density low bulk bubble defined by 0 1 and k k 0 r r 0 as 1 these properties mean that the relative speed of propagation is small but the contrast of the transmission coefficient is moderate such bubbles are not known to exist in nature but they might be designed see 30 these configurations give rise to different types of resonant frequencies we classify them as follows the minnaert resonance which corresponds to a surface mode for the low density low bulk bubbles the body resonances which correspond to body modes for the moderate density low bulk bubbles 1 http arxiv org abs 2110 03043 v 2 the size of such resonances depends on the value of r in particular they are very large when r 2 and very small when r 2 in terms of the relative diameter 1 however when r 2 they are moderate and their dominant parts are independent of in what follows we present the general setting of our problem and provide a qualitative argument showing how these resonances indeed appear 1 1 resonant frequencies generated by a micro bubble let r 3 be an open bounded and connected domain with a smooth boundary 1 we define the contracted domain x x y 0 y y 0 y 1 1 and denote with its boundary the acoustic medium is defined by the density and the bulk k both discontinuous across inside 0 outside and k k inside k 0 outside 1 2 let uin x ei 0 k 0 x be the incident plane wave propagating in the direction and be the exterior unit normal to the scattering of uin by the medium perturbation introduced in 1 2 is described by the boundary value problem see 3 7 1 2 1 k u 0 in r 3 u in u ex 1 u in 1 0 u ex at usc u uin u sc x i 0 k 0 usc o x 1 as x 1 3 where f in ex denote the lateral traces on it is worth noticing that these interface conditions provide with the regularity of the total field u usc uin across the boundary we further refer to 12 13 for the physical setting justifying 1 3 denoting with k 0 the green s function of the background medium 0 k 0 satisfying the outgoing sommerfeld radiation conditions and with 1 1 0 1 k 1 k 0 1 4 the contrasts between the inner and the outer acoustic coefficients by the lippmann schwinger representation of the total acoustic field u we have u x x g 0 x y u y dy 2 g 0 x y u y dy uin x 1 5 an integration by parts allows to transform this integro differential equation into a solely integral equation see detailed computations in 14 sec 3 u x k 2 g 0 x y u y dy g 0 x y u y dy uin x 1 6 we next rephrase this problem using the newtonian volume type operator n l 2 l 2 n u x g 0 x y u y dy 1 7 with image in h 2 and the surface type operator 2 k h 1 2 h 1 2 k x p v x g 0 x y y dy 1 8 the notation adopted is justified by the fact that k identifies with the l 2 adjoint of the well known neumann poincare operator see subsection a 5 taking the normal derivative here simply denoted with and trace on from 1 6 we obtain the surface integral equation 1 2 u k 2 n u k u uin at 1 9 1 in most of the computations the lipschitz regularity is enough and all the results here presented hold with a boundary of class c 1 1 however to avoid too many technicalities we prefer to work with a smooth boundary 2 here p v refers to the cauchy principal value 2 hence the total acoustic field in the exterior of the bubble r 3 is fully computable from the values u and u in which are solutions of the following closed form system of integral equations i k 2 n u g 0 x y u y d y uin x in 1 10 1 1 2 k u k 2 n u 1 u in at 1 11 the newtonian and the neumann poincare operators appearing above can be similarly defined on the dilated domain let us simply denote them as n and k in this case when 0 each of the operators n 0 and k 0 generates discrete sequences of eigenvalues p n 0 m m n r and p k 0 1 2 1 2 1 12 these are the key properties in estimating the resonances since n and k scale as n 2 n 0 and k 1 2 2 k 0 as 0 these operators may excite the eigenvalues of n 0 or k 0 and create a singularity in 1 10 1 11 depending on the scales defining our micro bubbles for low density low bulk bubbles we have k 1 and then k 2 n 1 as 1 hence there is no singularity coming from 1 10 nevertheless if 2 as 1 which corresponds to the assumption of a low density and bulk regime with r 2 then a suitable choice of allows to excite the eigenvalue 1 2 of k 0 and create a singularity in 1 11 in this case we have the minnaert resonance with surface modes this resonance was first observed in 7 based on indirect integral equation methods this result was extended to more general families of micro bubbles in 3 and 4 see also the more recent 17 and 18 for moderate density low bulk bubbles we have 1 and then we keep away from the full spectrum of k 0 hence there is no singularity coming from 1 11 but as k 2 1 suitable choices of allow to excite the eigenvalues of the newtonian operators n 0 and create singularities in 1 10 this gives us a sequence of resonances with volumetric modes which were observed in 5 and 25 observe that if is negative i e negative mass densities similar to the drude model for electromagnetism for instance then we could excite the other sequence of eigenvalues of k 0 this gives us another sequence of resonances i e corresponding to the sequence of plasmonics in electromagnetics when the incident frequency is close to the ones generating the singularities the total field inside the bubble solution of the system 1 10 1 11 becomes large this implies an enhancement of the scattered and far fields and motivates the definition of resonant frequency which became widely used in a somehow generic sense the limit behaviour of the scale dependent scattering problem 1 6 has been described in 7 14 where the asymptotic analysis is developed using layer potential techniques and the gohberg sigal theory here we develop a different approach based on the resolvent analysis of a frequency dependent schro dinger operator the advances provided by this approach are presented in section 1 3 1 2 the equivalent frequency dependent schro dinger operator the asymptotic framework is next realized by contrasting an homogeneous acoustic background with a small homogeneous inclusion supported on whose acoustic density and bulk are both defined by the piecewise constant field 1 r 3 21 following the notation introduced in 1 1 1 2 we assume k 1 2 inside 1 outside 1 13 since both contrasts are of size 2 this regime defines a low density low bulk bubble and according to our previous discussion generates an asymptotically bounded minnaert resonance with dominant part independent of furthermore in this particular scaling we have k 0 compare with 1 2 which cancels the body potential contribution in 1 6 in what follows we incorporate the assumption 1 13 in our scattering problem and provide with a frequency dependent auxiliary operator allowing to rephrase 1 3 in terms of a generalized eigenfunction problem this approach requires a large use of layer mappings potentials and integral operators which naturally appear in the modeling of scattering from interfaces and obstacles the precise definitions the related mapping properties and the common notation are recalled in the appendix when these operators refer to the contracted boundary we adopt appropriate notation which are next introduced 3 let in ex 0 and in ex 1 denote the lateral traces and normal traces operators on the corresponding mean traces and jumps are 0 1 and 0 1 respectively omitting the radiation condition which is next tacitly assumed the acoustic scattering equation 1 3 writes as 1 r 3 21 2 1 r 3 21 u 0 in r 3 0 u 0 ex 1 2 in 1 u 0 on 1 14 since the co normal jump condition implies 1 u 2 1 in 1 u 1 15 this problem rephrases as 2 u 0 in r 3 0 u 0 1 u 2 1 in 1 u on 1 16 the dirichlet to neumann operator for the domain next denoted with dnz is defined by dnz in 1 u z 2 u 0 in in 0 u on 1 17 such a definition is well posed whenever z 2 d where d is the dirichlet laplacian in l 2 since inf d 0 by z 2 d 2 z 2 d 1 18 there follows that for each z c there exists 0 0 small enough depending on z such that dnz exists for all 0 0 assuming 2 2 d the solution of 1 16 solves the homogeneous problem in 1 17 with z 2 2 and with boundary datum in 0 u by definition we have in 1 u dn in 0 u 1 19 and 1 16 recasts to 2 u 0 in r 3 0 u 0 1 u 2 1 dn 0 u on 1 20 let us recall from 21 and 23 that given s 0 1 2 and b hs h s self adjoint in the sense of the duality and defining d r 3 as u d u 1 21 a self adjoint in l 2 r 3 realization of is provided by the restriction of ker 0 to functions fulfilling interface conditions of the kind 0 u 0 1 0 u 1 22 see also 10 and 9 for previous references to this topic this suggests a formal analogy between our problem and the generalized eigenfunction equation for singular perturbations of the laplacian with type transmission conditions as a further support to this remark we also notice that the integral form of 1 20 simply reads as compare with 1 6 u uin 2 1 sl in 1 u 1 23 where uin is an incoming wave in this case a solution of 2 uin 0 in r 3 and sl is the single layer operator related to hence the scattered field is represented in terms of a single layer potential which as it has been shown in 22 corresponds to the solution form of the scattering problem for type singular perturbations of the free laplacian a specific feature of classical scattering problems consists in the fact that the total field identifies with a generalized eigenfunction of an auxiliary schro dinger type operator which usually depends on the frequency 4 this is quite evident when one considers the simpler stationary problem for classical waves propagating in a medium with a local perturbation of the bulk assume for instance to have a piecewise constant bulk described by b 01 1 r 3 then a stationary wave with frequency 0 solves the equation 2 1 b 0 1 2 u 0 corresponding to the generalized eigenfunction problem at energy 2 for the schro dinger operator 2 1 b 0 1 in the attempt of adapting this construction to the more complex framework considered in 1 20 which involves a discontinuity on both for the acoustic bulk and density we push further the analogy and consider h of the form 2 1 dn 1 24 as a candidate for the frequency dependent operator to identify the solutions of 1 20 in terms of generalized eigenfunctions of h at energy 2 1 3 the main results the precise definition of h is h u u in r 3 1 25 for any u in the domain dom h u h 0 r 3 h 1 r 3 1 u 2 1 dn 0 u 1 26 where h 0 r 3 is the set of the functions u l 2 r 3 such that u l 2 r 3 u l 2 r 3 1 27 notice that the jump condition 0 u 0 is incorporated into dom h h 1 r 3 the properties of h are investigated in section 3 we next resume the main features of this model let s 0 denote the single layer operator of the laplacian in the whole space see the definition in subsection a 4 the capacitance of is defined by c s 10 1 x d x 1 28 and the related minnaert frequency is m c 1 29 where denotes the volume of it is worth recalling that the positiveness of s 0 implies c 0 according to theorem 3 1 and definitions in subsection 3 3 for each 0 and 0 sufficiently small 1 26 and 1 25 define a self adjoint operator in l 2 r 3 the corresponding resolvent equation h z 2 u f 1 30 is nothing but z 2 u f in r 3 0 u 0 1 u 2 1 dn 0 u 1 31 in this work we provide the asymptotic analysis of the problems 1 20 and 1 30 by using a resolvent operator approach our aims are the resolvent analysis of resonances and global asymptotic expansions of the scattered field the main contributions and the novelties with respect to previous works are summarized in the following 1 resolvent s asymptotics and acoustic resonances since h depends on the physical frequency the dominating term of its resolvent h z 2 1 may still depend on the values of as 0 our main result consists in showing that the resonant frequency m is the unique value of at which the resolvent has a non trivial limit converging toward a point perturbation of the laplacian after introducing the sobolev spaces h 2 y 0 r 3 u cb r 3 u l 2 r 3 u l 2 r 3 u y 0 0 h 2 y 0 r 3 h 2 y 0 r 3 l 2 r 3 u h 2 r 3 u y 0 0 5 such a limit operator is defined as y 0 dom y 0 l 2 r 3 l 2 r 3 y 0 u u 0 u q y 0 1 32 dom y 0 u l 2 r 3 u x u 0 x q g 0 x y 0 u 0 h 2 y 0 r 3 q c 1 33 in this framework the free laplacian is the laplacian operator defined on dom h 2 r 3 and its resolvent has the green kernel gz x y eiz x y 4 x y with reference to the notation and results in 2 chapter i 1 y 0 corresponds to the operator denoted there by y with 0 and y y 0 see 2 theorem 1 1 2 it belongs to the class of point perturbations of the free laplacian and is a self adjoint extension of the closed symmetric restriction h 2 y 0 r 3 by the well known kre n resolvent formula one has y 0 z 2 1 u z 2 1 u 4 i z gz y 0 gz y 0 u l 2 r 3 1 34 equivalently its integral kernel is given by y 0 z 2 1 x y gz x y 4 i z gz x y 0 gz y y 0 the next result shows that h converges in norm resolvent sense as 0 to y 0 if and only if m otherwise the limit is trivial i e it equals the free laplacian theorem 1 1 for any z c ir and for any 0 sufficiently small one has 6 m h z 2 1 z 2 1 l 2 r 3 l 2 r 3 c 1 35 m h z 2 1 y 0 z 2 1 l 2 r 3 l 2 r 3 c 1 2 1 36 perturbations with small support and high contrast have been considered in connection with the low energy behaviour of schro dinger operators in the case of a perturbation by a regular potential the asymptotic problem was discussed in 1 while the case of a like perturbation supported on a small sphere was considered in 27 in both cases the resolvent convergence toward a point interaction model was proved under the condition that the corresponding unperturbed dilated hamiltonian has a zero energy resonance while our model does not directly fit in the framework considered in these works it exhibits a similar physical behaviour following the conclusions of 1 and 27 this suggests that a zero energy resonance should appear at 0 m for the dilated operator h as the resolvent analysis shows indeed see remark 3 7 the map z h z 2 1 is analytic in the neighbourhood of any 0 this corresponds to the absence of eigenvalues or resonances of h around any point z 2 2 of the positive continuous spectrum there is however a strong indication that in the resonant regime h m may have an eigenvalue resonance localized in a neighbourhood of size of the origin despite its theoretical relevance the analysis of this point is outside the main scope of our work and it is postponed to a further development while acoustic resonances have been previously discussed by a direct approach to the scattering problem e g in 7 and 17 their characterization in terms of the resolvent asymptotics was not enlightened so far our result clarifies the role of the physical resolvent for the stationary acoustic equation in the emergence of such resonances in the asymptotic regime 2 a global in space asymptotic expansion of the scattered field according to the resolvent equation 1 30 the acoustic scattering problem in the equivalent form 1 20 identifies with the generalized eigenfunctions problem for h this important feature is discussed in details in section 4 the interest in establishing such relation is not merely formal indeed it allows to represent the scattered field in terms of the limit resolvent on the continuos spectrum hence the global in space asymptotic behavior of the solutions of 1 20 is determined by similar computation to the ones leading to the norm resolvent asymptotic expansions of h in particular we consider two regimes in terms of and in the first one discussed in the section 4 1 we fix and provide the expansion in term of only 6 theorem 1 2 let 0 1 2 and let l 2 r 3 h 2 r 3 be the weighted spaces in a 1 a 2 for uin h 2 r 3 a solution of the homogeneous helmholtz equation 2 uin 0 1 37 denote with usc the unique radiating solution of the scattering problem 1 r 3 21 2 1 r 3 21 usc 0 in r 3 in 0 ex 0 uin u sc 0 2 in 1 ex 1 uin u sc 0 on 1 38 then for any 0 sufficiently small one has uniformly with respect to the choice of the incoming wave uin 6 m usc x 2 c 2 m 2 uin y 0 ei x y 0 4 x y 0 r x r l 2 r 3 c 3 2 1 39 m usc x 4 i uin y 0 ei x y 0 4 x y 0 r x r l 2 r 3 c 1 2 1 40 in the second one discussed in section 4 3 we provide the expansions by varying both and theorem 1 3 let cm 0 and im r be a bounded interval containing m for any 0 sufficiently small the expansion usc x 2 c 2 m 2 i 3 c 4 uin y 0 ei x y 0 4 x y 0 r x 1 41 r l 2 r 3 c 3 2 2 m 2 1 2 1 42 holds uniformly with respect to both in im m cm and uin in any bounded subset of h 2 r 3 coherently with what emerges from the resolvent analysis these expansions shows that when approaches m the scattering system undergoes a transition between an asymptotically trivial scattering and a non trivial one the transition is enlighten in 1 41 with the lower bound condition m cm the expansions of the scattered field in theorems 1 2 and 1 3 hold in the whole space for any fixed 0 small enough depending on it is worth to recall that similar formulas were previously obtained in 7 and 17 for the rescaled problem by a different method nevertheless while holding uniformly w r t these formulas were limited to the far field zone x i e without an uniform control in space of the errors the uniform in space asymptotic expansion of usc here provided by the resolvent analysis can be relevant in applications involving the knowledge of the near field moreover since usc fulfills the outgoing radiation condition our results can be easily rephrased in terms of the far fields pattern yielding possibly under the additional constraint m cm to those formulas of the scattering enhancement near the minnaert frequency already presented in the above mentioned works remark 1 4 as a consequence of the absence of embedded eigenvalues and singular continuous spectrum of h see remark 3 7 the map 7 usc is continuous on any interval of the real axis with the only possible exception of the origin provided that is small enough hence we expect that the constraint m cm in 1 41 could be removed by improving the control of the error r 1 4 approach and perspectives a common approach to the analysis of perturbations with small support and high contrast consists in introducing an equivalent dilated system in our case this allows to work with integral operators defined on the fixed boundary following this strategy in theorem 3 1 we build a family of self adjoint operatorsh depending both on the scale parameter and the frequency which encode the dilated interface conditions at the physical operators h are then obtained in section 3 3 by conjugation of the dilated resolvent with the 7 unitary dilation operators these singular perturbation models are defined through kre n like resolvent formulas representing the difference h z 2 1 z 2 1 in terms of an explicit interaction operator which is a boundary map modeling the interaction between the background and the inhomogeneity see 3 20 below by the limiting absorption principle the scattered fields also represent in terms of this boundary map through an exact formula depending on the incoming wave hence the asymptotic analysis mainly reduces to the analysis of this boundary operator most of the computations can be carried out in the case of multiple low density low bulk bubbles each having a specific minnaert frequency when multiple bubbles share the same excitation frequency the expected limit scattering in the resonant regime will be described by a multiple point scattering system expansions similar to 1 41 have been recently provided in the regime of highly contrasted small inclusions with non homogeneous acoustic backgrounds and different bulk density ratios see 14 these results suggest that the mechanism leading to the scattering enhancement enlighten in this work actually characterizes a much larger class of models it is worth noticing that while our simplified setting allows to implement purely singular perturbation methods in the resolvent analysis of the problem in more general frameworks the auxiliary schro dinger operator associated to the scattering problem would exhibit both singular and regular potential like perturbation terms whose resolvent analysis requires some generalization with respect to the one here employed 1 5 notation r x r x 0 c z c im z r c r

interface conditions here we introduce the schro dinger type operators modeling acoustic interface conditions their construction involves the boundary operators whose existence and mapping properties have been discussed in the small scale limit in section 2 3 1 the dilated operator in this subsection we provide together with its resolvent a self adjoint realization of the laplacian with bound ary conditions at the interface separating in from ex r 3 given by 0 u 0 1 u 2 1 dn 0 u 3 1 the vector space h 0 r 3 appearing in the next theorem is defined as the set of the functions u l 2 r 3 such that the distributional laplacian r 3 u is in l 2 r 3 see 1 27 and a 12 for more details theorem 3 1 let 0 and h be the restriction of h 0 r 3 l 2 r 3 l 2 r 3 3 2 to the domain dom h u h 0 r 3 h 1 r 3

its resolvent is given by r z h z 2 1 rz slz 2 1 1 dn sz 1 dn 0 rz 3 4 where rz denotes the free resolvent i e rz z 2 1 proof here for the sake of brevity we set m z 2 1 1 dn sz 3 5 by a 29 and lemma

and 2 7 be aware of the different notation and convention our m w 1 dn corresponds to z in 23 while our rz z 2 1 is there denoted with r 0 z hence 23 theorem 2 4 applies and we conclude that for the fixed z r z rz slz m z 1 dn 0 rz rz slz 2 1 1 dn sz 1 dn 0 rz 3 8 is the resolvent of a self adjoint operator h in l 2 r 3 which extends ker 0 by 11 theorem 2 19 such a resolvent formula extends to all z c such that z 2 h c 0 in particular by the self adjointness of h 3 8 holds at least for any z c ir let us now show that h h by the mapping properties of slz see a 13 slz m z 1 has values in h 1 r 3 and so by 0 slz 0 see a 14 one gets dom h h 1 r 3 by green s formula a 11 taking into account the boundary conditions in 3 3 one readily can check that h is a symmetric operator hence since h ker 0 h 0 r 3 it suffices to show that dom h u h 1 r 3 u u 0 slz m z 1 dn 0 u 0 u 0 h 2 r 3 dom h to this aim let us notice at first that the identity z 2 slz z 2 gz 0 0 0 0 implies slz x z 2 slz x for

slz m z 1 dn 0 u 0 2 1 m z dn 0 u since m z is a bijection this is equivalent to 1 u 2 1 dn 0 u finally let us show that h is semi bounded again by green s formula a 11 for any u dom h and for any s 0

dom h due to dom h h 1 r 3 remark 3 3 the dirichlet to neumann operator dn appearing in both the definitions of dom h and r z is well defined for any 0 and a sufficiently small 0 such that 0 2 denoting the smallest eigenvalue of d see subsection a 6 in the appendix remark 3 4 building upon the theory of singular perturbations presented in 21 the self adjointness of h could be proved without the assumption 1 here we prefer to exploit a less technical construction involving asymptotic estimates for the operator 2 1 1 dn sz this allows us to avoid a slightly burdensome abstract framework while the asymptotic estimates as 0 provide the natural tool of the subsequent analysis 3 2 dilation identities we introduce the smooth map y y 0 y y 0 0 y 0 r 3 3 9 the contracted domain is then defined by x r 3 x y 0 y y 0 y 3 10 while its boundary is given by x r 3 x y 0 y y 0 y the map and its inverse induce unitary operators on l 2 r 3 defined by u u x 3 2 u 1 x u 1 u y 3 2 u y 3 11 by the definition of u one gets 2 u u 1 and hence rz 2 u r zu 1 3 12 in the next lemmata for any linear operator l in spaces of functions on or we denote by l the corresponding operator in spaces of

theorem 3 1 h is a well defined self adjoint and semi bounded operator in l 2 r 3 and by relations 3 13 3 14 3 15 it can be more explicitly defined as the restriction of h 0 r 3 l 2 r 3 l 2 r 3 to the domain dom h u h 0 r 3 h 1 r 3 1 u 2 1 dn 0 u 3 17 notice that the jump condition 0 u 0 is incorporated into dom h h 1 r 3 moreover by 3 4 and lemmata 3 5 and 3 6 its resolvent r z h z 2 1 2 u h 2 z 2 1 u 1 is given by r z rz 2 u sl z 2 1 1 dn s z 1 dn 0 r zu 1 3 18 for successive notational convenience let introduce gz 1 2 u sl z 3 19 then using 2 26 the resolvent formula 3 18 re writes as r z rz gz z g z 3 20 remark 3 7 by 3 20 the eigenvalues and the resonances of h are those z 2 such that z c is a pole of the map z 7 z by the results in theorem 2 6 this map is analytic in the ball z z r 0 whenever 6 m or in z r 1 z r 0 whenever m provided that is small enough depending on and r 1 r 0 in the small regime this shows the absence of eigenvalues resonances in any open bounded region of the riemann surface if 6 m or the absence of eigenvalues resonances away from the origin if m the operator h provides a self adjoint realization of the laplacian with boundary conditions at the interface and by exploiting its definition and taking into account the boundary conditions appearing in 3 17 for any f l 2 r 3 one gets the resolvent equation h z 2 u f z 2 u f in r 3 0 u 0 1 u 2 1 dn 0 u 3 21 notice that 3 21 is equivalent to h u f 1 r 3 21 u 1 r 3 21 f in 0 u ex 0 u 2 in 1 u ex 1 u 16 3 4 proof of theorem 1 1 we consider here the norm resolvent limits of our model operator h as 0 as should be clear from the resolvent formula 3 20 to study the resolvent convergence of h the behavior of z when 1 is of pivotal importance the related asymptotic formula provided in theorem 2 6 undergoes a sudden change depending on 6 m or m this mechanism produces a discontinuity of the map 7 r z in the limit 0 the proof of theorem 1 1 goes as follows by theorem 2 6 z 2 s 1 zp 0 p 0 o p 0 o 2 s dn 3 22 where 1 6 m 0 m z e 0 1 6 m 4 i c z 1 m 3 23 by lemma a 1 s 1 s 1 0 o and by lemma a 6 which relies on lemma a 3 s dn k 0 2 2 k 2 o 3 k 0 q 0 1 2 k 0 q 0 inserting these relations into 3

property and consider the stationary scattering problem related to h according to the definitions of section 3 3 h acts as outside since h h 0 r 3 while its domain is characterized by the interface conditions 0 u 0 1 u 2 1 dn 0 u hence a generalized eigenfunctions u h 2 loc r 3 h 2 h 2 loc r 3 of h with eigenvalue 2 solves the problem 2 u 0 in r 3 0 u 0 1 u 2 1 dn 0 u 4 1 by the next result the generalized eigenfunctions ofh relate to the scattering solutions and to the functions of the kind g with h 1 2 notice that according to the mapping properties of and r the functions g 1 2 u sl 1 2 u r 0 belong to the weighted sobolev space h 2 r 3 1 2 theorem 4 1 let 0 and uin h 2 r 3 1 2 be a solution of the homogeneous helmholtz equation 2 uin 0 4 2 the scattering problem 2 uin u sc 0 in r 3 0 u sc 0 1 u sc 2 1 dn 0 uin u sc lim x x x x i usc 0 4 3 admits an unique solution in h 2 r 3 given by usc g 0 uin 4 4 proof we proceed in two steps at first we consider a dilated problem with interface conditions assigned on and prove the result in this setting then we discuss 4 3 by using the dilation mapping let in h 2 r 3 be a solution of the helmholtz equation 4 2 and consider the dilated scattering problem 2 in sc 0 in r 3 0 sc 0 1 sc 2 1 dn 0 in sc lim x x x x i sc 0 4 5 notice that due to 3 15 dn is here replaced by dn we next proceed as in 22 lemmata 5 1 and 5 3 where a similar problem involving abstract boundary conditions were discussed let us look for a solution of the form sc 1 sl 0 in by 22 lemma 5 3 sc satisfies the sommerfeld radiation condition in 4 5 since the distributions 0 h 1 2 are supported on from k 2 sl k 2 r 0 0 and 4 2 there follows k 2 in sc 0 in r 3 18 the boundary conditions in 4 5 follows by proceeding along the same lines as in the proof of theorem 3 1 see the calculations there involving the function u by a 14 and in h 2 r 3 it results 0 sc 0 and 1 sc 1 1 sl 0 in 1 0 in furthermore from 2 1 dn 0 in sc 2 1 dn 0 in 1 sl 0 in 2 1 dn 0 in 1 2 1 dn 0 sl 0 in 2 1 dn 0 in 1 1 2 1 dn s 0 in 1 0 in 2 1 dn 0 in 2 1 dn 0 in 1 0 in 1 0 in there follows 1 sc 2 1 dn 0 in sc hence sc solves the dilated scattering problem 4 5 to conclude this part of the proof we need to show that such a solution is unique let us assume that v solve the same scattering problem then the difference w sc v solves the exterior helmholtz equation r 3 2 w 0 4 6 and satisfies the radiation condition lim x x x x i w 0 4 7 let r 0 such that br x r 3 x r by 24 eq 9 19 there follows lim r x r w x 2 d x 0 and by rellich s lemma see e g 24 lemma 9 8 this entails w 0 in r 3 br the green identity in br then yields br w x 2 dx 0 w x 1 w x d x 2 br w x 2 dx and hence im 0 w x 1 w x d x 0 by 24 lemma 9 9 this gives w x 0 whenever x r 3 since 0 w 0 the boundary conditions in 4 5 imply in 0 w in 1 w 0 and so w solves the interior helmholtz equation with both zero dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions this implies w x 0 whenever x let us next consider 4 3 setting u u in u sc and using the identities 3 13 3 14 3 15 and u 1 u 2 we get 2 2 k 2 u 1 u 0 in r 3 0 u 1 u 0 1 u 1 u 2 1 dn 0 u 1 u 4 8 then the function 2 u 1 u 4 9 solves the problem 2 k 2 0 in r 3 0 0 1 2 1 dn 0 19 let sc 2 u 1 u sc since u sc fulfills the radiation conditions in 4 3 it follows lim x x i sc lim x x i 2 u 1 u sc x 1 2 lim x x i usc y 0 x y 0 1 2 lim x x usc y 0 x y 0 i usc y 0 x y 0 0 hence a scaled radiation condition holds for sc moreover from 4 2 follows 2 2 2 u 1 u in u 1 2 uin 0 then in 2 u 1 u in is a solution of the helmholtz equation at energy 2 2 therefore the total field in sc solves the dilated scattering problem 4 5 at energy 2 2 whose unique solution by the first part of the proof writes as sc 1 sl 0 in from 4 9 there follows u 2 u 2 u in 1 sl 0 in 2 u 2 u 1 u in 1 sl 0 2 u 1 uin uin 1 u sl 0 u 1 uin using the definition 3 19 this leads us to usc 3 2 g 0 u 1 uin and from 0 u 1 u in 3 2 0 uin the representation 4 4 follows remark 4 2 according to 4 1 the solution uin u sc in 4 3 can be equivalently defined as the unique generalized eigenfunction of h with eigenvalue 2 such that usc satisfies the outgoing sommerfeld radiation condition according to the above remark the next result is the analogous of theorem 1 1 as regards the behavior of generalized eigenfunctions of h whenever 1 theorem 4 3 for any 0 and for any 0 sufficiently small let u u in u sc be as in theorem 4 1 then one has 6 m u u l 2 r 3 c 3 2 4 10 m u u l 2 r 3 c 1 2 4 11 where 1 2 u x u in x c 2 2 m 2 uin y 0 g x y 0 4 12 u x u in x 4 i uin y 0 g x y 0 4 13 and the estimates hold uniformly with respect to the choice of uin in any bounded subset of h 2 r 3 20 proof by a 32 applied to u in one gets uin uin y 0 2 h 2 b c b 1 2 uin 2 h 2 r 3 where 1 2 and b r 3 is any star shaped bounded open set since 0 l h 2 b h 3 2 and uin h 2 r 3 it follows 0 uin uin y 0 h 1 2 c 1 2 uin 2 h 2 r 3 4 14 and hence 0 uin uin y 0 o 1 2 we next proceed along the same lines as in the proof

combining 4 4 with 4 15 and 4 16 one gets 4 10 4 13 remark 4 4 suppose uin x is a plane wave with direction and frequency i e u in x e i x then in consistency with theorem 1 1 u in 4 13 is a generalized eigenfunction with eigenvalue 2 of the self adjoint operator y 0 defined in 1 32 and 1 33 see 2 equation 1 4 11 there 0 and y y 0 4 1 proof of theorem 1 2 we are now in the position to prove our results for the acoustic scattering problem as pointed out in section 1 2 the acoustic equation 1 r 3 21 2 1 r 3 21 u 0 in 0 u ex 0 u 2 in 1 u ex 1 u 4 17 is equivalent to the generalized eigenvalue problem for the operator h at energy 2 by theorem 4 1 the corresponding scattering problem is well posed and the diffusion of an incident wave uin with frequency 0 is described by the outgoing radiating solution 4 4 and allows the asymptotic expansions provided in theorem 4 3 hence for uin h 2 r 3 1 2 a solution of the homogeneous helmholtz equation 2 uin 0 4 18 the boundary value problem 4 17 admits an unique solution u h 2 r 3 1 2 such that usc u uin satisfies the outgoing sommerfeld radiation condition the scattered field represents as usc g 0 uin 4 19 i e u is a generalized eigenfunction of h with eigenvalue 2 moreover for any 0 sufficiently small the expansions 1 39 1 40 follow from 4 10 4 13 21 4 2 quasi resonant asymptotic scattering solutions the estimates in the expansions provided in the theorem 1 2 see also theorem 4 3 are frequency dependent and so they are useless as regards an accurate descriptions of the transitions between the two different asymptotic scattering regimes as the frequency approaches the minnaert one m in this section we provide more refined estimates which are uniform with respect to the frequency their proof relies on uniform estimates on the expansion of the operator which we provide at first theorem 4 5 let cm 0 im r be a bounded interval containing m and e 0 e 1 be given by 2 17 2 21 for 0 sufficiently small the

sobolev spaces given r 3 open and bounded with smooth boundary we adopt the notation in ex r 3 the symbols hs r 3 hs in h s ex h s s r denote the usual scales of sobolev hilbert spaces of function on r 3 in ex and respectively see e g 24 we use the notation hs r 3 hs in hs ex let x 1 x 2 1 2 and r then we define the weighted l 2 space by l 2 r 3 u l 2 loc r 3 u l 2 r 3 u l 2 r 3 x u l 2 r 3 a 1 the weighted sobolev spaces of positive integer order are defined by h r 3 u l 2 r 3 u h r 3 u 2 h r 3 k dku 2 l 2 r 3 a 2 if s 0 is not integer hs r 3 is defined via interpolation and for s 0 we define hs r 3 as the dual of h s r 3 the spaces l 2 ex and h s ex are defined in a similar way one has l 2 r 3 l 2 in l 2 ex and we set hs r 3 hs in hs ex a 2 the free resolvent let be the distributional laplacian whenever restricted to h 2 r 3 it is a self adjoint operator in l 2 r 3 and its resolvent rz z 2 1 z c a 3 provides a map rz l hs r 3 hs 2 r 3 for any s 0 for any u l 1 r 3 l

valued continuous map for any real s by the resolvent identity rz rw z 2 w 2 rwrz the latter entails that c z 7 rz is a l hs r 3 hs 2 r 3 valued analytic map for any real s by the limiting absorption principle see e g 20 theorem 18 3 c z 7 rz extends to a map c z 7 rz defined as z 7 z 2 1 z c lim 0 i 2 1 z r a 5 the above limit exists in l h s r 3 h s 2 r 3 for any s 0 2 where 1 2 whenever 6 0 or

we get rz 0 l h 1 2 s d r 3 s 1 2 this defines the well known single layer operator slz rz 0 let recall from 24 corollary 6 14 that the mapping properties slz l hs hs 3 2 r 3 s 1 a 13 and the jump relations 0 slz 0 1 slz 1 a 14 hold for any c comp r 3 and z c moreover slz has the integral representation slz gz y y d y a 15 where denotes the surface measure when z c the mapping properties ofrz the identity slz 0 r z and a duality argument allow to improve a 13 as follows slz l hs hs 3 2 r 3 s 3 2 z c next we define the single layer boundary operator sz 0 slz by 24 theorem 7 2 sz l hs hs 1 for any real s the operator s 0 plays a central role in our construction by 24 corollary 8 13 s 0 h 1 2 h 1 2 is self adjoint positive and bounded from below s 0 h 1 2 h 1 2 c 0 2 h 1 2 c 0 0 a 16 hence s 10 l h 1 2 h 1 2 r 3 provides an inner product in h 1 2 defined by s 10 s 1 0 h 1 2 h 1 2 a 17 by a 16 the inner product in a 17 induces a norm s 10 on h 1 2 which is equivalent to the original one lemma a 1 c z 7 sz is a l h 1 2 h 1 2 r 3 valued analytic map and sz s 0 n 1 s n z n a 18 where s n has the integral representation s n x 1 4 in n x y n 1 y d y a 19 and the series converges in lhs h 1 2 h 1 2 r 3 let d be the discrete set d z c z 2 d then c d z 7 s 1 z is a l h 1 2 h 1 2 r 3 valued analytic map proof let k 1 c be the orthonormal basis in h 1 2 defined by k lb 1 1 4 k where k 1 c is the set of normalized eigenfunctions of the self adjoint operator lb h 2 l 2 l 2 here lb denotes the laplace beltrami operator on the surface with respect to the riemannian metric

therefore s n is a hilbert schmidt operator and its hilbert schmidt norm is estimated by the penultimate inequality follows from 15 proposition 4 3 s n 2 hs k 1 s n k 2 h 1 2 i j 1 i i lb 1 1 4 lb 1 1

c z 7 s z by a 7 and a 15 one has i s z j h 1 2 i sz s 0 j h 1 2 for any z c and for any couple i j therefore sz s 0 s z for any z c by 24 theorem 7 6 sz is fredholm with zero index by 24 theorem 7 5 ker sz 6 0 is equivalent to the existence of non trivial solutions of d z 2 u 0 hence s 1 z l h 1 2 h 1 2 r 3 for any z c d the proof is then concluded by lemma a 1 and by the analyticity of the inverse see 28 theorem 5 1 a 5 the neumann poincare operator proceeding as before we observe from a 10 that 1 l h 3 2 s e r 3 for s 3 2 then for z c we get rz 0 l h 1 2 s d r 3 s 1 2 this defines the double layer operator dlz rz 1 let recall from 24 corollary 6 14 that the mapping properties dlz l hs hs 1 2 r 3 s 0 hold for any c comp r 3 and z c moreover dlz has the integral representation dlz y

has the decomposition k 0 p 0 k 0 p 0 q 0 k 0 q 0 1 2 p 0 q 0 k 0 q 0 a 22 27 lemma a 3 c z 7 kz is a l h 1 2 valued analytic map and kz k 0 k 2 z 2 n 3 k n z n a 23 where the series converges in lhs h 1 2 on smooth functions k n has the integral representation k n x n 1 1 4 in n y x y x y n 3 y d y a 24 proof we proceed as in the proof of lemma a 1 see that proof for the definitions of k for any
