quantity in addition the initial conditions are chosen to have o 1 sobolev type norms the spacial dimension is 3 these equations are similar in spirit to the hartree fock bogoliubov equations for fermions for bosons they were derived in 19 20 and independently in 1 and the recent paper 2 which addresses both fermions and bosons estimates for hfb 3 reading this paper requires no knowledge of fock space however as background material we will review the big picture motivating this work as well as 16 20 see these papers for background on fock space and additional references related to this project our work started in 16 in collaboration with d margetis is devoted to the problem of approximating the exact evolution in fock space exact e ithe na 0 e b k 0 2 by an expression of the form 7

literature the fock space hamiltonian acts as a pde hamiltonian on each entry of fock space hn pde n j 1 xj 1 n i j n 3 v n xj xk 4 m grillakis and m machedon in the math literature the fock space evolution eith has been studied in the 70 s by by hepp in 21 ginibre and velo 15 and 30 years later by rodnianski and schlein 26 followed by 16 where eb is explicitly introduced the problem is to find a fock space approximation of exact which involves linear schro dinger equation in an unbounded number of vari ables by approx e na t e b k t 7 where t x k t x y satisfy non linear schro dinger equations in 3 1 respectively 6 1 variables as explained below the motivation for the equations discussed in this paper is that they describe a good choice of and k accomplishing this approximation there are several equivalent ways of writing these equations see 19 20 the equation for k is best expressed in terms of the auxiliary functions and which are functions of and k and are generalized marginal density matrices for the proposed fock space approximation explicitly the equations 1 a 1 c were written in 20 in an equivalent form reminiscent of bbgky in terms of the marginal densities li

the problem of proving a fock space estimate for exact approx is currently an active field see 8 25 and 5 in that paper boccato cenatiempo and schlein prove a result in the range 1 and the estimate is global in time their approximation is given translating to our notation by ei t e na t e b k t u 2 n t where satisfies the expected cubic nonlinear schro dinger equation k t k t x y is explicit and u 2 n t is an evolution in fock space with a quadratic generator see the page preceding theorem 1 1 in 5 the function k t which corresponds to pair correlations has to be present in the initial data regarding the analysis of such correlations see also 10 14 our approach based on coupled pdes for and k offers the possi bility to start with uncorrelated initial data and allow the correlations to develop dynamically in very short time in the present paper we obtain estimates for the generalized marginal densities and in our previous paper 20 devoted to the case 0 2 3 we showed how estimates for and imply estimates for k which in turn imply fock space estimates for the proposed approximation 7 our work was 6 m grillakis and m machedon extended globally in time in 12 see also 11 for the analysis of these equations in 1 1 dimensions for 2 3 1 there are greater difficulties in both the pde problem of obtaining estimates for and and the fock space approxima tion for this reason we treat the two issues separately this paper addresses only the pde problem leaving the fock space estimates for future work we conjecture that using the estimates of this paper it is possible to prove exact appr f e ithe na 0 e b k 0 ei t e na t e b k t f cece ct n for 1 2 for suitable initial conditions which include pure coherent states k 0 0 and a phase function this type of estimate is comparable to 5 but allows more freedom in the choice of initial conditions fock space techniques can also be applied to l 2 rn approximations see the recent paper 27 and the references therein we also mention the approach of 24 we end this section with some general comments regarding the equa tions studied in this paper since we are looking for estimates which hold uniformly in n it is instructive to replace vn by then 1 a 1 c become formally 1 i t x 1 x 1 t x 1 x 1 x 1 1 i t x 1 x 2 x 1 x 2 x 1 x 1 x 2 x 2 x 1 x 2 1 i t x 1 x 2 x 1 x 2 x 1 x 1 x 1 x 2 x 1 x 2 x 2 x 2 these equations are invariant under the following scaling 2 t x 1 2 2 t x 1 x 2 2 2 t x 1 x 2 which is h 1 criti cal for and however scaling does not detect the collapse to the diagonal x 1 x 2 for instance if we replace x 1 x 1 x 1 x 2 by x 1 x 2 2 the scaling would be the same since there is loss of regu larity in going from x 1 x 2 2 to x 1 x 1 2 this make the equations h 1 supercritical on the other hand as explained in the next section the conserved energy for the full system has the scaling of h 2 for but only h 1 for however as shown in 12 a norm of with the estimates for hfb 7 scaling of h 1 grows in time but not n using these conserved quan tities the local existence theorem and estimates of the current paper can be extended globally in time see 12 how this works out the case 2 3 we plan to address the problem of global estimates in detail in a forthcoming paper the plan of the paper is as follows section 2 reviews the conserved quantities derived in our earlier paper 19 and contains some addi tional comments section 3 has the statement of the main nonlinear theorem and a simple statement of the main linear estimates which are shown to imply the main non linear theorem sections 4 reviews standard xs b type estimates needed for the proof section 5 introduces new estimates including a technical statement of the main linear re sult the rest of the paper is devoted to the proof of the main linear estimates each of those sections starts with a heuristic guide to the proofs in that section acknowledgment we thank daniel tataru for a very useful conver sation regarding the estimates of this paper 2 conservation laws and further comments the system 1 a 1 c has two important conserved quantities we men tion this fact here although we do not use it in the construction of solutions locally in time where the solutions are obtained by a fixed point argument using the norms and estimates of theorem 3 3 these conserved quantities would be crucial to extend our estimates globally in time solutions to the system considered in this paper but without potentials depending on n have been constructed in 1 the first conserved quantity is the total number of particles nor malized by division by n and it is m tr t 13 this means that m 1 the second conserved quantity is the energy per particle e tr x 1 x 2 t 1 2 dx 1 dx 2 vn x 1 x 2 t x 1 x 2 2 1 4 dx 1 dx 2 vn x 1 x 2 t x 1 x 2 2 t x 1 x 1 t x 2 x 2 1 2 dx 1 dx 2 vn x 1 x 2 t x 1 2 t x 2 2 14 which is conserved by the evolution notice that the quantity e defined above is positive because the following inequality is true t x 1 x 2 8 m grillakis and m machedon t x 1 t x 2 in the sense of operator kernels with t x 1 t x 2 representing the kernel of orthogonal projection onto in order to see what kind of regularity the conservation laws imply we observe that the kinetic part of the energy is tr x 1 x 2 dx x t x 2 1 2 n dx 1 dx 2 x 1 u 2 x 2 u 2 now if we observe that denoting u sh k c ch k see 11 12 sh 2 k 2 u c c c u u a simple calculation implies the inequality dx 1 dx 2 x 1 2 x 2 2 4 dx 1 dx 2 x 1 u 2 x 2 u 2 1 dx 1 dx 2 u 2 since we have 1 2 n then dx 1 dx 2 x 1 2 x 2 2 ce m n 1 i e the h 1 norm of is bounded by a constant which is independent of time in fact one can show see 12 for some 0 dx 1 dx 2 x 1 1 2 x 2 1 2 2 c t where c t is independent of n on the other hand 1 n u u which implies a better estimate namely x 1 x 2 t l 2 dx 1 dx 2 e it is interesting to observe that the construction of solutions is accom plished using norms which are slightly below the thresholds indicated by the above estimates see theorem 3 3 remark 2 1 it is an interesting task at this point to write down the evolution equations in the case of aligned fermions for the simple hamiltonian defined on fermionic fock space h dx 1 dx 2 c x 1 x 1 x 1 x 2 cx 2 c x 1 c x 2 v x 1 x 2 cx 2 cx 1 we have the following type of reduction we form two pair functions t x 1 x 2 and t x 1 x 2 they satisfy certain relations namely estimates for hfb 9 and t moreover t x x 0 and they are not independent of each other they must satisfy 2 0 the two evolution equations are 1 i t x 1 x 2 2 v x 1 x 2 dy v x 1 y x 1 y y x 2 x 1 y y x 2 y y x 1 x 2 dy v y x 2 x 1 y y x 2 x 1 y y x 2 y y x 1 x 2 0 and 1 i t x 1 x 2 dy v x 1 y x 1 y y x 2 x 1 y y x 2 y y x 1 x 2 dy v y x 2 x 1 y y x 2 x 1 y y x 2 y y x 1 x 2 0 the analogy is 7 t and 7 but notice that is now anti symmetric the system conserves the number of particles n 1 2 tr dx t x x and the total energy e 1 2 tr x 1 x 2 t x 1 xx 2 1 4 dx 1 dx 2 v x 1 x 2 t x 1 x 2 2 1 4 dx 1 dx 2 v x 1 x 2 t x 1 x 1 t x 2 x 2 t x 1 x 2 2 we may observe that we can set consistently 0 is which case we obtain the familiar equation for which must be a projection the equations above are written without any scaling if we scale space by n then we can rescale appropriately the interaction potential v the most natural assumption for v is coulomb see 4 and 2 for related work on fermionic systems we end this section with some comments on the structure of the nonlinear terms which if thought the right way look simple we 10 m grillakis and m machedon adopt the following convention for skew hermitian commutators and symmetrization for two operators say a and b a b a b b a a b a b bt at where recall a b means a b x 1 x 2 dy a x 1 y b y x 2 also denote s t x 1 x 2 1 i t x 1 x 2 s t x 1 x 2 1 i t x 1 x 2 with this convention we can write the equations as follows s t x 1 x 2 1 n vn vn diag vn vn vn vn 15 notice that t and t and vn means pointwise multipli cation i e vn x 1 x 2 vn x 1 x 2 x 1 x 2 vn diag x 1 x 2 dy vn x 1 y y y x 1 x 2 to see why 15 is correct notice that vn vn t vn t dy vn x 1 y x 1 y y x 2 t x 1 y vn y x 2 y x 2 the equation for reads s t x 1 x 2 vn diag vn vn vn vn 16 notice that and in computing the commutators and it easy to check that it is indeed correct estimates for hfb 11 3 statement of the main theorem we use the standard notation f lp dt lq dx l 2 dy f l 2 dy lq dx lp dt fix 1 2 chosen so that 2 1 this is so that roughly speaking 2 1 n vn is less singular than the delta function let 0 t 1 and c t the characteristic function of 0 t define the norms of t x y t

interpolation the same comment applies to n t and nt our main nonlinear theorem is the following 12 m grillakis and m machedon theorem 3 3 assume v is a schwartz function with v supported in the unit ball such that v w with w a schwartz function let 1 and fix 1 2 so that 2 1 let and be solutions to 1 a 1 b and 1 c then there exists n 0 n and 0 such that if 0 t 1 and n n 0 nt x y 0 l 2 t nt n t n 4

0 l 2 x t j x t 0 l 2 the time interval t 0 and the implicit constants in the above inequalities depend only on the following norm of the initial data x y 0 l 2 x y 0 l 2 x 0 l 2 estimates for hfb 13 also the theorem is valid for general functions and although for the application which motivates this work they satisfy a constraint which is preserved by the evolution remark 3 6 while the above theorem looks similar to theorem 6 1 in 20 the similarity is superficial in 20 we took 2 3 in order to be able to treat 1 n vn as a perturbation in x 1 2 type spaces the reason for that was x y 1 n vn x y l 6 5 and we were able to use the l 2 dt l 6 5 d x y l 2 d x y dual strichartz space in the present case 1 1 2 this is not the case since x y 1 n vn x y is almost as singular as x y roughly speaking is the sum of some pieces for which x y x 1 2 and one piece for which x y x y x 1 4 as well as t 1 4 x 1 4 see the term dz 2 in lemma 8 2 these estimates are sufficient in order to recover all strichartz type estimates the proof of this theorem follows from estimates for solutions to linear equations in order to prove these we have to recall the definition of the spaces x xs with s 0 see 30 for more regarding these denote s 1 i t x y or depending on the dimensions s 1 i t x s 1 i t x y so that the symbol of s is 2 2 and the symbol of s is 2 2 let f x 2 2 f l 2 d d d or depending on the dimensions f x 2 f l 2 d d f x 2 2 f l 2 d d d we note that the first application ofx spaces to the bbgky hierarchy is in the work of x chen and j holmer 9 14 m grillakis and m machedon we solve s f 18 0 0 in an interval 0 t by constructing 1 e it 0 c t s ei t s c s f s ds where c t is the characteristic function of 0 t t 1 and noticing c t c t 1 the following is known it follows from proposition 5 8 in 20 and lemma 5 2 see also 13 and 9 proposition 3 7 s f 0 0 s f 0 0 then for all 0 n t x y 0 l 2 dxdy x y c s f x 1 2 19 nt x 0 l 2 dx x c s f x 1 2 the main new contribution of our current paper is a non obvious modification of the above estimates for nt for an equation which includes the potential 1 n vn x y the short version 1 of our main linear theorem is theorem 3 8 let 0 1 and let s 1 n vn x y f 20 0 0 then for all 0 sufficiently small the following holds uniformly in n nt x y 0 x y c t f x 1 2 min x y 1 2 c t f x 1 4 x 1 2 y c t f x 1 4 1 see theorem 5 4 for the long version of the theorem estimates for hfb 15 remark 3 9 note that the definition of nt involves a quarter time derivative but the right hand side above involves no time derivatives this time derivative will be crucial in the proof of theorem 3 8 as well as future applications of the theorem to fock space estimates in preparation for the proof of theorem 3 3 we recall some stan dard inequalities for completeness a general statement and proof are included in lemma 4 2 we will freely use the following estimates f l 2 dt l 6 dx l 2 dy f x 1 2 21 i e there exist numbers 1 2 0 arbitralily small such

exposition notice that if 1 2 is sufficiently close to 1 2 p and q can be made arbitrarily close to strichartz admissible pairs for the sake of completeness we include a proof of lemma 4 2 proof it is

as well as their dual spaces x b one reason is that multiplication by c t is not bounded on x 1 2 but it is bounded on x 1 2 this is because the fourier transform of 0 is a singular integral operator

a more complicated norm denoted by n nt as opposed to the more elementary norms nt from the statement of theorem 3 8 recall 0 1 and 1 2 is such that 2 1 let 1 2 be a number such that 1 2 1 2 and 1 2 1

the term where one falls on the potential is handled in a similar way and so are the terms involving p n proof of theorem 5 4 the outline of the proof will be n n a n c n p n b n p n b n p n n b and

representative of the proof that follows provided at least one of x y fall on also from the above we can read off c t x 1 2 0 l 2 c t f x 1 2 n n and therefore since n on the fourier space support of

the second one uses littlewood paley decompositions notice the similarity with bourgain s improved strichartz estimate 7 9 1 first proof proposition 5 1 follows from the following lemma lemma 9 2 let f be as in proposition 5 1 let 0 2 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 2 2 0 1 3 a 1 4 1 a 2 0 2 3 1 4 then sup z t a 4 x a 2 t x z x l 2 dtdx 38 c 1 1 2 1 a 1 4 1 f 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 1 2 2 l 2 d 2 d 1 c 2 1 2 1 1 4 2 f 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 a 4 l 2 d 2 d 1 39 proof first notice that we have to estimate the integral below a 4 4 3 a 2 f 4 3 1 4 2 3 2 a 4 2 1 a 2 f 2 1 1 2 2 1 2 1 2 3 4 40 1 2 3 4 d d 1 d 4 and we will employ the following inequality a 4 c 1 2 2 2 a 4 1 2 2 2 a 4 41 to compute the integral let 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 1 2 2 and similarly with 3 and 4 then 1 2 3 4 next we set in spherical estimates for hfb 37 coordinates 1 2 1 1 1 s 2 3 4 2 2 2 s 2 we use cauchy schwartz in the angular variables 1 2 and for this purpose we introduce with parameters to be chosen later a f 2 s 2 d 2 2 f 2 because of the inequality 41 we obtain several terms one of which is 2 22 a 4 i 2 a f 2 1 2 22 2 21 a 4 i 1 a f 1 1 2 21 d where d d d 21 2 2 d 1 d 2 42 and the integral i is i 2 d 2 2 0 1 43 in addition we have i 2 a f 2 1 2 22 1 a 4 i 1 a f 1 1 2 21 1 a 4 d 44 as well as cross terms which can be estimated in the same manner so we will ignore them the first important observation is the fact that we can estimate i we use the

interesting fact i c 2 2 c 1 2 2 2 45 due to averaging over the angular variable if we use cauchy schwarz in the integrals 42 and 44 we end up estimating the integral j 2 r 2 d 1 2 2 1 2 2 1 1 2 1 1 2 1 2 2 c provided 1 2 0 explicitly we get 42 2 d 2 2 a 4 i a f 1 2 2 2 l 2 d d now we pick 1 a 1 4 1 3 a 1 4 0 2 1 so that 42 c 2 d a 1 f 2 2 1 1 4 1 2 2 2 l 2 d d c 1 2 1 1 4 1 f 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 1 2 2 l 2 d 2 d 1 as for 44 44 2 d i a f 1 2 2 1 a 4 2 l 2 d d here we pick 1 1 4 and 0 2 3 1 4 so that 44 c 2 d a 2 f 2 2 1 1 4 1 2 2 1 a 4 2 l 2 d d c 1 2 1 1 4 2 f 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 a 4 l 2 d 2 d 1 estimates

based on the following calculation i 2 2 a 1 2 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 d m 2 n if n 2 the integral is m 3 n 2 so assume n 2 then writing u 2 2 2 2 i 1 m 2 n 2 u n 2 1 u 1 2 2 a u 2 2 2 2 d du and sup 2 2 a 2

integral is m continuing we write 1 4 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 2 1 4 and have to estimate the corresponding terms in 1 4 f t x x 1 4 f 2 2 2 2 2 2 d we estimate separately 40 m grillakis and m machedon 2 1 2

the argument for 2 1 2 f 2 2 2 2 2 2 d d d is easier because in a finally 2 2 2 2 1 4 f 2 2 2 2 2 2 d d d f 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 2 2 d 1 2 1 2 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 d 1 2 m n 1 2 f 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 2 2 d
