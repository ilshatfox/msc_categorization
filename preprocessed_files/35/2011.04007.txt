we generalize the strichartz estimates for schro dinger operators on com pact manifolds of burq ge rard and tzvetkov 10 by allowing critically singular potentials v specifically we show that their 1 p loss l p tl q x i m strichartz es timates hold for e ithv when hv g v x with v l n 2 m if n 3 or v l 1 m 0 if n 2 with p q being as in the keel tao theorem and i r a bounded interval we do this by formulating and proving new quasimode estimates for scaled dyadic unperturbed schro dinger operators and taking advantage of the the fact that 1 q 1 q 2 n for the endpoint strichartz estimates when p q 2 2 n n 2 we also show that the universal quasimode estimates that we obtain are saturated on any compact manifolds however we suggest that they may lend themselves to improved strichartz estimates in certain geometries using recently developed kakeya nikodym techniques developed to obtain improved eigenfunction estimates assuming say negative curvatures 1 introduction and main results in 10 burq ge rard and tzvetkov showed that if m g is an n 2 dimensional compact manifold then the time dependent schro dinger operators associated with the laplace beltrami operator satisfy 1 1 e it g h 1 p m lptlqx i m ci if i r is a compact interval and 1 2 n 1 2 1 q 2 p and 2 p if n 3 or 2 p if n 2 hereh m denotes the l 2 sobolev space associated with the laplace beltrami operator on m with norm 1 3 u h m i g u l 2 m in the two dimensional case the bounds in 1 1 also depend on p q in practice there one just takes i 0 1 since this inequality implies the bound for all compact intervals the main purpose of this paper is to show that we also have the bounds in 1 1 if g is replaced by g v x with the potential v being real valued and satisfying 1 4 v ln 2 m when n 3 and v l 1 m some 0 if n 2 2010 mathematics subject classification 58 j 50 35 p 15 key words and phrases schro dinger equation eigenfunctions quasimodes the authors were supported in part by the nsf nsf grant dms 1953413 and the second author was also partially supported by the simons foundation 1 http arxiv org abs 2011 04007 v 2 2 quasimode and strichartz estimates for schro dinger equations such a result involves critically singular potentials since multiplication by elements of ln 2 scale the same as g indeed if we consider the euclidean laplacian then u 2 u and 2 v ln 2 v ln 2 and similar formulae hold on m g if we scale the metric we should also point out that the natural l 1 l estimates for solutions of the heat equation involving the operators 1 5 hv g v may break down when one merely assumes that v ln 2 m moreover individual eigenfunctions need not be bounded unlike the case where v is smooth see e g 1 4 and 20 on the other hand if v is as above then hv defines a self adjoint operator which is bounded from below see e g 3 among other things this allows us to define the time dependent schro dinger operators e ithv even though heat equation bounds may break down for ln 2 potentials we do have the analog of the strichartz estimates 1 1 of burq ge rard and tzvetkov theorem 1 1 let the potential v be real valued and satisfy 1 4 also assume that the pair of exponents p q is as in 1 2 we then have for any compact interval i r 1 6 e ithv u l p tl q x i m u h 1 p m we should point out that burq ge rard and tzvetkov 10 theorem 6 discussed a variant of the above theorem for the euclidean spaces with variable coefficient metrics and their arguments can easily be adapted to the setting of compact manifolds which would show that the above results hold when v ln m also our main point of departure from the analysis in 10 is to use dyadic cut offs in the time variable as opposed to the spatial variable we need to do this since littlewood paley operators associated with g are not easily seen to be compatible with ones associated to g v if v is singular we also note that the philosophy that for solutions of dispersive equations dyadic time frequency cut offs and spatial ones should be interchangeable is not new for instance for solutions of schro dinger equations this is crucially used in 14 and 18 and for wave equations in 17 just as burq ge rard and tzvetkov 10 did for the v 0 case we shall prove this result by showing that if one restricts to frequencies comparable to with large one has no loss estimates on small intervals of size 1 specifically if fix a real valued littlewood paley bump function 1 7 c 0 1 2 2 for future convenience satisfying 1 8 1 2 js for s 0 and s 1 s 3 4 5 4 then the main estimate in 10 is that for large we have 1 9 p eit g l 2 m lptlqx 0 1 m o 1 p g if p q are as in 1 2 since e it g is a unitary operator on l 2 m this of course says that one has o 1 bounds on all intervals of length 1 and so by adding up o of quasimode and strichartz estimates for schro dinger equations 3 these bounds they obtained the estimate 1 9 p eit g l 2 m lptlqx 0 1 m o 1 p which leads to 1 6 with v 0 using standard littlewood paley estimates associated with g we shall follow this strategy and ultimately prove analogous dyadic estimates for e ithv that will allow us to obtain 1 6 we shall have to show that the littlewood paley estimates for hv are valid for the exponents q in 1 2 which we shall obtain in an appendix using a general spectral multiplier theorem of blunck 7 and recent estimates in our collaboration with blair and sire 3 in order to obtain these natural dyadic variants of 1 6 we shall rely on certain microlocalized quasimode estimates for the unperturbed scaled schro dinger operators with a damping term 1 10 i t g i since there is no reason to expect that the littlewood paley operators associated with g are compatible with the corresponding ones for hv g v x with v singular it does not seem that we would be able to use quasimode estimates for the unperturbed operator g to prove results for hv if these estimates include spatial dyadic cutoffs p as above we shall mitigate this potential issue by using the littlewood paley operators acting on the time variable dt h x 2 1 eit h d with as above let us be more specific our main estimates will concern solutions of the scaled inhomogeneous schro dinger equation with damping term 1 11 i t g i w t x f t x w 0 0 it will be convenient to assume that the forcing term here satisfies 1 12 f t x 0 t 0 1 the result that we shall use to prove theorem 1 1 then is the following theorem 1 2 suppose that f satisfies the support assumption in 1 12 and that w solves 1 11 then for 1 and exponents as in 1 2 we have 1 13 dt w l p tl q x r m 1 1 p f l 2 t x 0 1 m and also 1 14 dt w l p tl q x r m 1 2 p f l p t l q x 0 1 m furthermore the quasimode estimates 1 13 are sharp on any manifold these microlocalized quasimode estimates are natural analogs of the ones obtained by one of us for laplace beltrami operators in 22 additionally the first estimate 1 13 essentially follows from the results of one of us and seeger 19 as was the case in these earlier works and more recently in 4 and 3 it is natural to include the damping 4 quasimode and strichartz estimates for schro dinger equations term i to exploit the fourier analysis that arises in the present context it allows use fourier analysis in r to link dyadic microlocal cutoffs in the spatial variable involving p g with the above ones involving the time variable as we shall see being able to prove time microlocalized estimates for solutions of inhomogeneous equations involving the operators in 1 10 will allow us to use the duhamel formula to prove our estimates for e ithv in a manner that is somewhat reminiscent to arguments in a recent joint work 3 on uniform sobolev estimates for the operators hv it is for this reason and others that it is important for us to prove natural estimates for inhomogeneous equations as opposed to ones just involving the cauchy problem on the other hand our proof of 1 13 and 1 14 will be modeled by the arguments in 10 that lead to 1 9 in 4 we shall show that the quasimode estimates 1 13 are optimal this paper is organized as follows in the next section we shall prove theorem 1 2 then in 3 we shall show how we can use the above theorem along with littlewood paley estimates to obtain the strichartz estimates in theorem 1 1 we shall prove the littlewood paley estimates that we require in an appendix in 4 we shall show that the universal bounds 1 13 that easily imply the estimates 1 9 are saturated on any manifold even though bourgain and demeter 8 showed much better estimates hold on the torus when p q 2 n 2 n with just an loss for all 0 and burq ge rard and tzvetkov 10 also showed that on spheres there are improvements of 1 9 in many cases it seems a challenge to show that there are improvements in more general cases such as when m has negative sectional curvature however the knapp example that we shall construct in 4 suggests that perhaps the kakeya nikodym techniques that have been recently developed in 5 6 23 24 and 26 to obtain improved eigenfunction estimates in certain geometries might lend themselves to this problem we are grateful to the referee for several helpful suggestions which improved our ex position 2 quasimode estimates for scaled schro dinger operators in this section we shall prove theorem 1 2 if is as in 1 7 1 8 let us define wider cutoffs that we shall also use as follows 2 1 s j 10 2 js c 0 2 10 210 for future use note that 2 2 s 1 on 1 4 4 one of the main estimates in 10 is that one can obtain the expected o t n 2 dis persive estimates for p eit g p g on time intervals of the form for 1 if 1 for some m 0 using the weyl formula they also showed that these o t n 2 l 1 l bounds are optimal in the sense that no such uniform bounds are possible if as using the bounds for each fixed littlewood paley bump function 2 j one can of course obtain analogous o t n 2 dispersive estimates involving in 2 1 on intervals 1 1 so after possibly changing scales in time and correspondingly scaling the laplace beltrami operator we may always quasimode and strichartz estimates for schro dinger equations 5 assume that we have the bounds 2 3 p eit g l 1 m l m c t n 2 t 1 by virtue of 10 lemma 2 5 we also trivially for all times t have the bounds 2 4 p eit g l 2 m l 2 m c c l as was noted in 10 one can use the keel tao theorem 15 theorem 1 2 to obtain the uniform dyadic strichartz estimates 2 5 p eit gf l p tl q x 0 1 m c f l 2 m if n 1 2 1 q 2 p and 2 p if n 3 or 2 p if n 2 we have excluded the case of p in 2 5 since then q 2 and the estimate is trivial with 0 1 replaced by any interval by the spectral theorem also for future use note that the endpoint case in dimensions n 3 involves the exponents p 2 and q 2 n n 2 for which we have 1 q 1 q 2 n where as usual q denotes the conjugate exponent being able to include this estimate will allow us to handle potentials v ln 2 when n 3 while the fact that the endpoint estimate for n 2 breaks down accounts for the reason that we assume that our potentials lie in l 1 some 0 if n 2 we shall use an equivalent variant of this estimate and the related estimate for inho mogeneous equations that will be formulated first for the unit interval to simplify the fourier analysis to follow we first trivially note that 2 5 is equivalent to the estimate 2 6 p eit 1 ge tf l p tl q x 0 1 m c 1 p f l 2 m p q as in 2 5 and since eis g has l 2 m l 2 m operator norm one we also have the damped global estimate 2 7 p eit 1 ge tf l p tl q x 0 m c 1 p f l 2 m p q as in 2 5 note that for the scaled schro dinger operator in 1 10 we have 2 8 i t g i eit 1 ge th x 0 to proceed let 1 s 1 0 s denote the heaviside function and 2 9 u t 1 t p e it 1 ge t be the operator in 2 7 for later use let us note that we can rewrite this operator indeed if we recall that 2 1 eit i 1 d 1 t e t we deduce that 2 10 u t f x i 2 eit g i p f x d 6 quasimode and strichartz estimates for schro dinger equations also if we regard u as an operator sending functions of x into functions of x t then its adjoint is the operator 2 11 u f x 0 e s e is 1 g p f s x ds consequently 2 12 u t u s f s x ds 1 t 0 ei t s 1 ge t s 2 p e 2 sf s x ds note also that if say 2 13 f t x 0 t 0 1 then the solution to the scaled inhomogeneous schro dinger equation with damping term 2 14 i t g i w t x f t x w 0 0 is given by 2 15 w t x i 1 t 0 ei t s 1 ge t s f s x ds 2 1 1 0 ei t s g i f s x d ds thus since w t 0 for t 0 it follows from 2 9 2 10 and 2 15 that 2 16 2 p w t x i 1 t 0 u t u s e 2 s 2 p f s x ds 2 1 1 0 ei t s g i 2 p f s x d ds using these formulas we claim that we can use the arguments of burq ge rard and tzvetkov 10 along with the keel tao 15 theorem to deduce the following proposition 2 1 suppose that f satisfies the support assumption in 2 13 and that w solves 2 14 then for exponents as in 2 5 and 1 we have 2 17 2 p w l p tl q x r m 1 1 p f l 2 t x 0 1 m and also 2 18 2 p w l p tl q x r m 1 2 p f l p t l q x 0 1 m we remark that like 1 13 the bounds in 2 17 are also optimal proof to use the dispersive estimates 2 3 of burq ge rard and tzvetkov let 2 19 v t f x 1 0 1 t u t f x 1 0 1 t e t p eit gf x we then clearly have v t l 2 m l 2 m 0 1 quasimode and strichartz estimates for schro dinger equations 7 and 2 3 says that v t v s l 1 m l m t s n 2 we can use the keel tao theorem along with these two inequalities to deduce that v t f lp t l q x 0 1 m f l 2 m as well as t 0 v t v s g s ds l p t l q x 0 1 m g l p t l q x 0 1 m and 1 0 v s g s ds l 2 m g l p t l q x 0 1 m using 2 19 we deduce that these inequalities are equivalent to 2 20 u t f lptlqx 0 1 m 1 p f l 2 m as well as 2 21 t 0 u t u s h s ds l p tl q x 0 1 m 2 p h l p t l q x 0 1 m if h s 0 s 0 1 and 2 22 1 0 u s h s ds l 2 m 1 p h l p t l q x 0 1 m respectively using 2 21 with h e 2 sf along with 2 16 we obtain the analog of 2 18 where the norms are taken over 0 1 m since h lptlqx f lptlqx due to 2 13 since as we noted before w and hence 2 p w vanishes for t 0 to prove the remaining part of 2 21 we need that we also have 2 23 2 p w l p tl q x 1 m 1 2 p f l p t l q x 0 1 m since for t 1 t 0 u t u s h s ds u t 1 0 u s h s ds h e 2 sf it is simple to check that by 2 22 we would have this inequality if 2 24 u t f lptlqx 1 m 1 p f l 2 m however since for j 1 2 and s 0 1 u j s e jei 1 j gu s and eit 1 g l 2 l 2 1 we deduce that 2 p w l p tl q x j j 1 m e j 1 2 p f l p t l q x 0 1 m j 1 2 3 which of course yields 2 23 and as a result 2 17 8 quasimode and strichartz estimates for schro dinger equations since u s l 2 m l 2 m o 1 using 2 16 along with 2 20 and 2 24 we find that if h e 2 sf 2 p w l p tl q x r m 1 1 0 1 t s u t u s h s l p tl q x r m ds 1 1 p 1 0 u s h s l 2 x ds 1 1 p 1 0 f s l 2 x ds 1 1 p f l 2 t x 0 1 m as desired which completes the proof by an argument we shall give in the next section the quasimode estimates 2 17 for the scaled schro dinger operators in 1 10 imply the dyadic strichartz estimates 2 3 of burq ge rard and tzvetkov 10 unfortunately though as we noted before we do not seem to be able to directly use proposition 2 1 to obtain analogous estimates for hv g v with v ln 2 m n 3 or the 2 dimensional ones in theorem 1 1 since littlewood paley operators associated with hv are not easily seen to be compatible with the corresponding ones involving g if v is allowed to be singular it is for this reason that we need the bounds in theorem 1 2 involving the littlewood paley cutoff dt in the time variable we are now in a position to prove this result we shall use proposition 2 1 and the following two elementary lemmas whose proofs we postpone for the moment lemma 2 2 let c 0 and 1 p 2 q then 2 25 p f lq m cp q sup 0 1 n 1 p 1 q f lp m lemma 2 3 suppose that 2 26 k t t 1 t t 2 then if 1 p q we have the following uniform bounds for 1 2 27 k t t g t dt l p tl q x r m c g lptlqx r m also suppose that wf t x m k t x t y f t y dvol y ds and that for each t t r the operator wt t f x m k x t y t f y dvol y satisfies wt t f lq m 1 t t 2 f lr m for some 1 r q then if 1 s p we have for 1 2 28 wf lptlqx r m c 1 s 1 p f lstlrx r m quasimode and strichartz estimates for schro dinger equations 9 proof of theorem 1 2 we first note that the kernel of dt is o 1 t t 2 therefore by 2 27 dt 2 p w lptlqx r m 2 p w lptlqx r m therefore if as in proposition 2 1 and our theorem our forcing term f satisfies 2 13 it suffices to show that dt i 2 p w enjoys the bounds in 1 13 and 1 14 recalling 2 15 this means that it suffices to show that 2 29 1 0 ei t s p 2 i 1 2 p f s d ds l p tl q x r m 1 1 p f l 2 t x 0 1 m as well as 2 30 1 0 ei t s p 2 i 1 2 p f s d ds l p tl q x r m 1 2 p f l p t l q x 0 1 m to use lemma 2 3 set t s ei t s 2 i 1 2 d and note that by 2 2 and the support properties of we have for j 0 1 2 j j 1 2 2 i 1 2 2 1 which by a simple integration parts argument translates to the bound t s 1 t s 2 2 2 1 if we use lemma 2 2 we deduce from this that the frozen operators tt sh x ei t s p 2 i 1 2 p h x d satisfy 2 31 tt sh lq m 1 t s 2 2 n 1 2 1 q h l 2 m 1 t s 2 2 2 p h l 2 m as well as 2 32 tt sh lq m 1 t s 2 2 n 1 q 1 q h lq m 1 t s 2 2 4 p h lq m due to the fact that our assumption on the exponents in 2 5 means that n 1 2 1 q 2 p and n 1 q 1 q 2 n 1 2 1 q 4 p if we combine 2 31 and 2 28 we conclude that the left side of 2 29 is dominated by 1 2 1 p 2 2 p f l 2 t x r m 3 2 1 p f l 2 t x r m which is better than the bounds posited in 2 29 by a factor of 1 2 10 quasimode and strichartz estimates for schro dinger equations similarly if we combine 2 32 and 2 28 we find that the left side of 2 30 is domi nated by 1 p 1 p 2 4 p f l p t l q x r m 1 2 p f l p t l q x r m as desired which completes the proof to conclude this section for the sake of completeness let us now prove the lemmas both of which are well known the first is a slight generalization of lemma 2 3 in 9 for instance while the second lemma is essentially theorem 0 3 6 in 25 proof of lemma 2 2 since 1 p n 1 2 1 q l 2 m lq m and 1 p n 1 p 1 2 lp m l 2 m by orthogonality we obtain p f lq m 1 p n 1 2 1 p p f l 2 m sup 0 1 n 1 p 1 q 1 p n 1 p 1 2 f l 2 m sup 0 1 n 1 p 1 q f lp m as desired proof of lemma 2 3 to obtain 2 27 we note that by minkowski s inequality and 2 26 k t t g t dt l q x m 1 t t 2 g t lqx m dt taking the l p t norm of both sides and using young s inequality yields k t t g t dt l p tl q x r m 1 t t 2 g t lqx m dt p dt 1 p c g t p l q x m dt 1 p g lptlqx r m as desired one also obtains 2 28 from this argument after noting that by young s inequality convolution with 1 t 2 has ls r lp r operator norm which is o 1 s 1 p 3 strichartz estimates on compact manifolds let us now see how we can use the first estimate in theorem 1 2 to prove the dyadic strichartz estimate 2 5 of burq ge rard and tzvetkov 10 this simple argument will serve as a model for the one we shall use to prove the same sort of bounds where we replace g with hv g v with v singular let us first recall that the spectrum of g is nonnegative and discrete if we account for multiplicity we can arrange the eigenvalues 0 0 1 2 and the associated l 2 normalized eigenfunctions gej 2 j m ej 2 dvg 1 quasimode and strichartz estimates for schro dinger equations 11 form an orthonormal basis for l 2 m if then ejf x m f ej dvg ej x denotes the projection onto the j th eigenspace we have eit gf j 0 e it 2 jejf to prove 2 5 it clearly suffices to show that for large we have the uniform bounds 3 1 t eit gf l p tl q x r m c f l 2 m if spec f 9 10 11 10 and c 0 0 1 is fixed the assumption on the spectrum of f is that ejf 0 if j 9 10 11 10 and we choose this interval since we are assuming that the littlewood paley bump function arising in theorem 1 2 satisfies 3 2 s 1 on 3 4 5 4 and supp 1 2 2 to be able to use 1 13 we note that after rescaling 3 1 is equivalent to the state ment that 3 1 w lptlqx r m c 1 p f l 2 m with w t x t eit 1 gf x to be able to use theorem 1 2 we shall use the following simple lemma lemma 3 1 let w be as in 3 1 with and f as in 3 1 and suppose that the exponents p q are as in 2 5 then for large enough and each n 1 2 we have the uniform bounds 3 3 i dt w l p tl q x r m cn n f l 2 m proof we first note the fourier transform of t t e it 1 2 j is 2 j and so 3 4 i dt w t x j 9 10 11 10 a t j ejf x where 3 5 a t 2 1 eit 2 1 d since for q as in 2 5 we have 2 q 2 n n 2 for n 3 and 2 q for q 2 the following sobolev estimates are valid 3 6 u lq m i g 1 2 u l 2 m therefore by the spectral theorem 3 7 j 9 10 11 10 a t j ejf lq m j 9 10 11 10 a t j ejf l 2 m 12 quasimode and strichartz estimates for schro dinger equations next since 2 p by minkowski s inequality and sobolev s theorem for r we therefore have i dt w lptlqx r m j 9 10 11 10 a t j ejf l p tl 2 x r m j 9 10 11 10 a t j ejf l 2 xl p t r m j 9 10 11 10 dt 1 2 1 pa t j ejf l 2 xl 2 t r m since by orthogonality j 9 10 11 10 dt 1 2 1 pa t j ejf 2 l 2 xl 2 t r m j 9 10 11 10 dt 1 2 1 pa t j ejf 2 l 2 xl 2 t r m we conclude that 3 8 i dt w lptlqx r m sup 9 10 11 10 dt 1 2 1 pa t l 2 t r f l 2 m next by plancherel s theorem 3 2 and 3 5 dt 1 2 1 pa t 2 l 2 t r 2 1 1 2 p 2 2 1 2 d 5 4 3 4 1 2 p 2 2 d note that 2 if if 5 4 3 4 and 9 10 11 10 and since s r the preceding inequality leads to the trivial bounds 3 9 sup 9 10 11 10 dt 1 2 1 pa t l 2 t r n combining this inequality with 3 8 yields 3 3 using the lemma and the first estimate in theorem 1 2 it is very easy to prove 3 1 we first note that we may apply this theorem since if w is as in 3 1 3 10 i t g i w t x i t i t eit 1 gf x vanishes if t 0 1 and w 0 x 0 therefore by 1 13 and 3 3 we have w lptlqx r m 3 11 dt w lptlqx r m i dt w lpt lqx r m 1 1 p i t t eit 1 gf l 2 r m n f l 2 m 1 p f l 2 m as desired quasimode and strichartz estimates for schro dinger equations 13 let us now prove dyadic high frequency estimates for e ithv where 3 12 hv g v with 3 13 v ln 2 m if n 3 and v l 1 m some 0 if n 2 let us focus first on the case where n 3 and then handle n 2 later under the assumption 3 13 hv defines a self adjoint operator which is bounded from below see e g 3 we wish to prove the analog of 2 5 for the operators e ithv if necessary we may add a constant to v so that 3 14 hv 0 as we shall always assume this will not affect our estimates since if we say add the constant n to v the two different schro dinger operators will agree up to a factor e itn just as with the v 0 case the eigenvalues of the operator hv defined by the spectral theorem are nonnegative discrete and tend to infinity we can list them count ing multiplicity as 0 1 2 and there is an associated orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions evj hv e v j 2 je v j with m evj 2 1 analogous to the v 0 case let evj denote the projection onto the jth eigenspace evj f m f evj evj then for large we wish to prove the analog of 2 5 3 15 e ithv f l p tl q x 0 1 m c f l 2 m if spec f 9 10 11 10 with the condition meaning that evj f 0 if j 9 10 11 10 we are assuming the exponents p q are as in 2 5 for later use we note that since e ithv is a unitary operator on l 2 m this estimate yields the unit scale bounds 3 15 e ithv f l p tl q x 0 1 m c 1 p f l 2 m if spec f 9 10 11 10 since by the spectral theorem e ithv l 2 m l 2 m 1 the estimate trivially holds for p and q 2 therefore by interpolation since we are currently assuming that n 3 it suffices to prove the estimate for the other endpoint i e that for f as in 3 15 we have 3 16 e ithv f l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x 0 1 m c f l 2 m by scaling this is equivalent to the statement that for f as above we have e it 1 hv f l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x 0 1 m c 1 2 f l 2 m finally as before this is equivalent to showing that whenever c 0 1 14 quasimode and strichartz estimates for schro dinger equations is fixed we have 3 17 w l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r m c 1 2 f l 2 m with w t x t e it 1 hv f with f as above to proceed we need the analog of lemma 3 1 lemma 3 2 let n 2 and let w be as in 3 17 with c 0 0 1 and f as in 3 15 and suppose that the exponents p q are as in 2 5 then for large enough and each n 1 2 we have the uniform bounds 3 18 i dt w l p tl q x r m cn n f l 2 m since for instance by 3 and 4 we have the analog of 3 6 u lq m i hv 1 2 u l 2 m for q as in 2 5 it is clear that the proof of lemma 3 1 yields 3 18 for the two dimensional case one uses the fact that if as we are assuming v l 1 m 0 then v is in the kato class k m we now are positioned to prove 3 17 to take advantage of our assumption 3 13 for a given large 1 as in 3 let us split v v v where v x v x if v x and 0 otherwise our assumption 3 13 then yields 3 19 v ln 2 m with 0 as and we also trivially have 3 20 v l m to use this we note that since hv g v i t g i w i t hv i w v w i t hv i w v w v w and also w 0 0 so we can split 3 21 w w w w where 3 22 i t g i w i t hv i w f w 0 0 3 23 i t g i w v w f w 0 0 and 3 24 i t g i w v w f w 0 0 note that since w t x 0 t 0 1 each of the forcing terms f f and f also vanishes for such t which allows us to apply the estimates in theorem 1 2 for w w and w quasimode and strichartz estimates for schro dinger equations 15 by 3 18 and 3 21 we have for each n 1 2 w l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r m 3 25 dt w l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r m cn n f l 2 m dt w l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r m dt w l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r m dt w l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r m cn n f l 2 m based on this we would obtain 3 17 if we could show that could be fixed large enough so that we have the following three inequalities 3 26 dt w l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r m c 1 2 f l 2 m as well as 3 27 dt w l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r m c 1 2 f l 2 m and finally 3 28 dt w l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r m 1 2 w l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r m indeed we just combine 3 25 3 28 and use a simple bootstrapping argument which is justified since the right side of 3 28 is finite by the aforementioned sobolev estimates for hv to prove these three estimates we shall use theorem 1 2 as we may since as we men tioned before the forcing terms in 2 21 2 22 and 2 23 obey the support assumption in 2 13 to prove 1 13 we note that if f is as an 3 22 then since w is as in 3 17 we have f t x i t hv i t e it 1 hv f x i t t e it 1 hv f x consequently as in the v 0 case considered before we may use the l 2 estimate 1 13 in theorem 1 2 to deduce that dt w l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r m 1 2 i t t e it 1 hv f l 2 t x r m 1 2 f l 2 m as desired similarly by 3 19 and the formula for w in 3 17 we obtain dt w l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r m c 1 2 v w l 2 t x r m c 1 2 t e it 1 hv f l 2 t x r m c 1 2 f l 2 m which is better than the inequality posited in 3 27 up until now we have not used the second inequality in theorem 1 2 we need it to obtain 3 28 which allows the bootstrapping step note that 1 q 1 q 2 n if q 2 n n 2 q 2 n n 2 16 quasimode and strichartz estimates for schro dinger equations consequently if we use 1 14 3 24 ho lder s inequality and 3 19 than we conclude that we can fix large enough so that we have dt w l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r m c v w l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r m c v ln 2 m w l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r m 1 2 w l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x r m assuming as we may in the last step that if is as in 3 19 c 1 2 since this is the last of the three inequalities we had to prove we have established 3 17 and hence 3 16 next let us point out that for functions only involving low frequencies we have these types of estimates for unit time scales for all of the exponents in 2 5 in all dimensions in other words if c 0 is fixed we claim that 3 29 e ithv f l p tl q x 0 1 m f l 2 m if spec f 0 c 0 to see this we just note that by the sobolev estimates that were used in the proof of lemma 3 2 we have the following uniform bounds for all times t e ithv f lq m i hv e ithv f l 2 m 1 c 0 f l 2 m by the spectral theorem for f as in 3 29 next let us show that for large enough when n 2 we have the estimates in 3 15 for each fixed p q as in 2 5 here we can take advantage of the fact that we must have p 2 and so the power of in 1 14 is negative since the bounds in 1 14 blow up as the exponents in 3 15 approach the forbidden pair p q 2 for n 2 one needs to choose larger and larger as q increases on the other hand by interpolation if we can establish 1 14 for a given q 0 and large enough as before by a trivial interpolation argument we also obtain the bounds for all q 2 q 0 to take advantage of our assumption on the potential in 3 13 let us thus fix an exponent q sufficiently large so that 3 30 1 q 1 q 1 1 we then can just split w into two terms w w wv one being w exactly as before and the other now solving i t g i wv v w wv 0 0 in other words wv w w if we repeat the arguments for the n 3 case we then deduce that we would have the estimates in 3 15 for our exponents p q if dt w l p tl q x r m c 1 p f l 2 m as well as dt wv l p tl q x r m 1 2 w l p tl q x r m assuming that is sufficiently large depending on q the first inequality follows from the argument used before one just uses 1 13 quasimode and strichartz estimates for schro dinger equations 17 to prove the second inequality we repeat the proof of 3 28 noting that our assump tions on q and v ensure that by ho lder s inequality v lr m cm v l 1 m where 1 r 1 q 1 q due to 3 30 as a result if we use 1 14 and repeat the proof of 3 28 we conclude that since w t x 0 for t 0 1 the left side of the second inequality is dominated by 1 2 p v w l p t l q x 0 1 m cq 1 2 p v lr m w lp t lqx 0 1 m cq v 1 2 p w lptlqx 0 1 m 1 2 w lptlqx for large enough since 1 2 p 0 in the second inequality we used ho lder s inequality in the t variable and the fact that p p proof of theorem 1 1 let us conclude the section by showing that the dyadic esti mates that we have obtained can be used along with littlewood paley estimates associ ated with hv yield theorem 1 1 for the sake of completeness we shall give the simple proof of the littlewood paley estimates involving singular potentials in an appendix let us state the estimates we require recall that we are assuming as in 3 14 as we may that hv 0 and so we may consider the operator pv hv if as in 1 7 and 1 8 is our littlewood paley bump function let 0 s 1 j 0 2 js c 0 0 2 we shall then use the littlewood paley estimates 3 31 h lq m 0 hv h lq m j 0 pv 2 j h 2 1 2 lq m provided that v is as in theorem 1 1 and 3 32 1 q if n 2 3 4 and 2 n n 4 q 2 n n 4 if n 5 we also note that since 2 n n 2 2 n n 4 when n 5 the exponents here include the exponents q arising in 1 2 also since p 2 and q 2 if p q are as in 1 2 we obtain from 3 31 and minkowski s inequality that we have for such exponents 3 33 e ithv f lptlqx 0 1 m 0 hv e ithv f lptlqx 0 1 m j 0 pv 2 j e ithv f 2 l p tl q x 0 1 m 1 2 additionally by 3 29 we have 3 34 0 hv e ithv f lptlqx 0 1 m 0 hv f l 2 m similarly if we use 3 29 for small j 0 and 3 15 for large j we obtain 3 35 pv 2 j e ithv f l p tl q x 0 1 m cv 2 j p pv 2 j f l 2 m j 0 1 for some uniform constant cv 18 quasimode and strichartz estimates for schro dinger equations if we recall 1 7 and 1 8 and combine 3 33 3 34 and 3 35 and use the spectral theorem we deduce that 3 36 e ithv f lptlqx 0 1 m 0 hv f l 2 m j 0 2 j p pv 2 j f 2 l 2 m 1 2 i hv 1 pf l 2 m this does not quite give us the estimate 1 6 in theorem 1 1 since the right hand side of this inequality involves the sobolev space h 1 p m defined as in 1 3 by the operator i g as opposed to sobolev space defined by the operator i hv as in 3 36 this though is easy to rectify by standard arguments see e g the appendix in 3 for the case where n 3 and the one in 4 for the two dimensional case for the potentials we are considering and for the exponents q as above we have i gf l 2 m i hv f l 2 m which means that the two l 2 sobolev spaces of order 1 are comparable by interpolation this means that we have 3 37 i g f l 2 m i hv f l 2 m 0 1 since the estimate for 0 is trivial if we combine 3 36 and 3 37 we obtain 1 6 which completes the proof of theo rem 1 1 4 sharpness of the quasimode estimates let us now show that our scaled quasimode estimates 1 13 cannot be improved on any compact manifold m g we do this by a knapp type construction that is adapted to our scaled schro dinger operators first recall that we can choose local coordinates vanishing at a given point x 0 m so that in these coordinates 4 1 g 2 1 1 j k n gjk x j k n k 1 bj x k here k xk k 1 n here g jk 1 j k n is a smooth real positive definite matrix and the bj are also smooth real valued functions see e g 13 appendix c 5 fix a c 0 1 10 1 10 which equals one near the origin and set 4 2 w t x ei x 1 t a t x where 4 3 a t x a x 1 2 t 1 2 a 1 2 x 1 2 t a 1 2 x with x x 2 xn due to the exponential factor the space time fourier transform of w is the space time fourier transform of a t x translated by 0 0 0 where the first coordinate here is dual to the time coordinate and the rest dual to the x coordinates since the quasimode and strichartz estimates for schro dinger equations 19 fouier transform of a x t is o 1 1 2 n for all n and since s 1 for s 3 4 5 4 it follows that 4 4 i dt w o n n also for each fixed t near 1 2 x a t x is one on a set of measure n 2 thus by 4 3 and 4 4 for sufficiently large we have 4 5 dt w lptlqx 0 1 m w lptlqx 0 1 m o n c n 2 q large for some c 0 note also that 4 6 f t x i t g i w t x 0 t 0 1 and w 0 x 0 next let us observe that 4 7 1 j k n gjk x j k n k 1 bj x k i w o also if we rewrite a t x as 4 8 a t x a 1 2 x 1 2 t a t x where a t x a x 1 2 t 1 2 a 1 2 x then 4 9 i ta x t o and j 1 a x t o 1 j 1 2 consequently by leibniz s rule we have 4 10 i t 2 1 w t x a t x i t 2 1 ei x 1 t ei x 1 t i t a 1 2 x 1 2 t 2 1 a 1 2 x 1 2 t 1 ei x 1 t o note that the first term in the right vanishes as does the sum of the second and third terms therefore by 4 1 and 4 7 4 10 we conclude that if f is as in 4 6 we have f o and since f is supported on a set of measure n 2 we deduce that 4 11 f l 2 t x r m 1 n 4 if we combine 4 11 and 4 5 we deduce that there must be a c 0 0 so that for sufficiently large we have 4 12 dt w lptlqx r m f l 2 t x r m c 0 1 n 1 4 1 2 q c 0 1 1 p if n 1 2 1 q 2 p by 4 6 and 4 12 we deduce that our l 2 quasimode estimate 1 13 is saturated on any compact manifold 20 quasimode and strichartz estimates for schro dinger equations some remarks a challenging problem is to determine when the results of burq ge rard and tzvetkov 10 can be improved even just for the v 0 case as they point out the sharpness of o 1 2 bounds for the l 2 n n 2 sn norms of l 2 normalized spherical harmonics of the second author 21 imply that on the sphere the l 2 tl 2 n n 2 x s n strichartz estimates 1 6 cannot be improved when v 0 on the other hand they were able to use results from 21 and the special nature of the laplacian on the sphere to show that for many cases besides this endpoint strichartz estimate improved bounds hold here more dramatically bourgain and demeter 8 were able to show on the torus tn for the case where q p 2 n 2 n and v 0 the analog of 1 6 is valid with any sobolev norm h tn in the right it does not seem clear though how much improvements are possible here as one approaches the endpoint case of p q 2 2 n n 2 beyond what holds just by interpolation with 1 6 for this exponent and the dramatic improvements for p q 2 n 2 n it would also be interesting to determine which singular potentials could be added so that e ithv enjoys similar bounds for the latter pair of exponents on tori related partial results for resolvent problems were obtained in our joint work with blair and sire 3 it would also be very interesting to determine whether there is a wide class of manifolds beyond just spheres and tori for which some of the estimates in 1 6 could be improved even for v 0 this seems to be a very challenging problem one avenue which is suggested by the knapp example above and recent work on eigenfunctions e g 5 6 23 24 and 26 might be to try to prove kakeya nikodym estimates that link strichartz estimates to ones involving products of powers of l 2 m norms and powers of supremums of l 2 norms over shrinking tubes the construction above suggests not unexpectedly that the tubes should be 1 2 neighborhoods of the projection onto t x space of integral curves of the hamilton flow of p x t q x where q x is the principal symbol of the g which in local coordinates is given by q x n j k 1 gjk x j k here gjk x denotes the cometric to be more specific one might expect to control high frequency solutions of schro dinger equations by kakeya nikodym norms over shrinking tubes about curves which in lo cal coordinates are of the form t t 0 t x 0 x t where x t is a geodesic with x 0 q x 0 0 and speed 2 q x 0 t 0 with t 0 x 0 r m this approach proved to be successful even for critical norms in the related case of estimates for eigenfunctions and in the aforementioned works improved eigenfunction estimates versus the universal bounds 22 of one of us were obtained for manifolds of nonpositive curvature it would be very interesting to prove a corresponding result for high frequency solutions of the unperturbed schro dinger equation quasimode and strichartz estimates for schro dinger equations 21 5 appendix littlewood paley and multiplier bounds involving ln 2 potentials consider a nonnegative self adjoint operator hv g v on a compact manifold consider also a mikhlin type multiplier m c r meaning that 5 1 j m c 1 j 0 0 j n 2 1 we shall also assume that we have finite propagation speed for the wave equation associated to hv by this we mean that if u v l 2 m and dg supp u supp v r then 5 2 u cos t hv v 0 t r additionally for a given 2 q 0 we shall assume that one has the bernstein dyadic sobolev estimates 5 3 hv u lq 0 m c n 1 2 1 q 0 u l 2 m 1 and 0 hv u lq 0 m c u l 2 m if 0 s 1 k 1 2 ks note that we would automatically have these bounds if we had the natural heat estimates of li and yau 16 for small times see 4 using a result of blunck 7 theorem 1 1 we claim that we can obtain the following theorem 5 1 assume that 5 2 and 5 3 are valid and that m is as in 5 1 then 5 4 m hv f lq m cq f lq m q q 0 q 0 if the standard small time pointwise heat kernel bounds held then the the results in theorem 5 1 hold for all 1 q by alexopoulos 2 however as was shown in 4 following 1 and 20 the standard small time heat kernel estimates need not hold if v ln 2 m since there can be unbounded eigenfunctions on the other hand assuming that v k m ensures that these estimates hold by sturm 27 here k m denotes the kato class recall also that if v ln 2 m 0 then v k m and that ln 2 m and k m enjoy the same scaling properties by the results in 3 5 3 holds for v ln 2 m if 2 q 0 if n 3 4 and if q 0 2 n n 4 if n 5 by results in 4 if n 2 one also has this bound for all 2 q 0 if v k m one obtains these dyadic sobolev estimates in higher dimensions n 5 directly from sobolev estimates proved in 3 and for n 2 3 4 by a simple orthogonality argument and the quasimode estimates proved in 3 and 4 in the other cases by a result of coulhon and sikora 12 5 2 is valid when hv is nonnegative self adjoint and v l 1 m alternately one can use arguments from 4 to show this for the potentials that we are considering consequently the estimates 5 4 are valid for the potentials we are considering pro vided that 1 q if n 2 3 4 and for 2 n n 4 q 2 n n 4 if n 5 1 therefore by a 1 we should point out that these results also are a consequence of estimates in 11 and in fact a stronger theorem involving weaker regularity assumption on the multiplier m also holds on the other 22 quasimode and strichartz estimates for schro dinger equations standard argument involving radamacher functions see e g 25 p 21 we obtain the littlewood paley estimates 3 31 that we used at the end of 3 corollary 5 2 if v ln 2 m and 1 q for n 3 4 or 2 n n 4 q 2 n n 4 for n 5 then whenever 5 1 is valid we have m hv l q m lq m if n 2 v k m and 1 q then these bounds also hold consequently under these hypotheses we have the littlewood paley estimates 5 5 h lq m cq v 0 hv h lq m k 1 hv 2 k h 2 1 2 lq m for q and v as above proof of theorem 5 1 by theorem 1 1 in blunck 7 it suffices to show that if q 2 q 0 we have for some q 0 5 6 1 b x 0 r e r 2 2 hv 1 b y 0 r lq m lq m r n 1 q 1 q e q dg x 0 y 0 r here 1 b x 0 r is the operator which is multiplication by the indicator function of the geodesic ball b x 0 r of radius r centered at x 0 we may assume that r is small say smaller than half the injectivity radius since otherwise the estimate is trivial due to 5 3 and a simple tt argument let us first use 5 2 to deduce that 5 7 1 b x 0 r e r 2 2 hv 1 b y 0 r l 2 m l 2 m e cdg x 0 y 0 r for some c 0 we should note that like 5 3 5 7 automatically holds when one has the standard small time heat kernel estimates we may assume that dg x 0 y 0 10 r since otherwise the result is trivial in this case choose c 0 1 2 1 2 with s 1 near the origin then since e r 2 2 hv 1 2 1 r e 1 2 t r 2 cos t hv dt and by 5 2 1 b x 0 r cos t hv 1 b y 0 r 0 if t r 0 dg x 0 y 0 2 we must have 1 b x 0 r e r 2 2 hv 1 b y 0 r 1 b x 0 r 1 2 1 t r 0 1 r e 1 2 t r 2 cos t hv dt 1 b y 0 r consequently 1 t r 0 1 r e 1 2 t r 2 dt e cdg x 0 y 0 r r 0 dg x 0 y 0 2 hand since the proof of theorem 5 1 is simple and since it easy to use the main theorem in 7 to see the ingredients that are needed we have chosen to include the proof here for the sake of completeness we also do this since checking that the hypotheses for the very general results in 11 which are needed to obtain theorem 5 1 is a bit laborious quasimode and strichartz estimates for schro dinger equations 23 and so by the spectral theorem 1 b x 0 r e r 2 2 hv 1 b y 0 r l 2 m l 2 m 1 2 1 t r 0 1 r e 1 2 t r 2 cos t hv dt l 2 m l 2 m e cdg x 0 y 0 r as claimed next by 5 3 e r 2 4 hv f lq 0 m 0 hv e r 2 4 hv f lq 0 m k 1 hv 2 k e r 2 4 hv f lq 0 m f l 2 m k 1 2 nk 1 2 1 q 0 hv 2 k e r 2 4 hv f l 2 m 1 k 1 2 nk 1 2 1 q 0
