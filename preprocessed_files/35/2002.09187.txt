the inverse problem of recovering simultaneously a potential and a point source in a shr dinger equation from the associated nonlinear dirichlet to neumann map the uniqueness of the inversion is proved and logarithmic stability estimates are derived it is well known that the inverse problem of determining only the potential while knowing the source is ill posed in contrast the problem of identifying a point source when the potential is given is well posed the obtained results show that the nonlinear dirichlet to neumann map contains enough information to determine simultaneously the potential and the point source however recovering a point source imbedded in an unknown background medium becomes an ill posed inversion 1 introduction and main results in this paper we study the issue of uniqueness and stability for determining simultaneously a smooth po tential and a point source in a shr dinger equation by boundary measurements motivation for investigating this inverse problem is provided by medical imaging as well as antenna synthesis 4 7 10 13 from the point view of mathematical modeling many works have considered the simplification that the background medium in which the source is imbedded is known here we are interested in recovering both the source and the background medium from cauchy data let rd d 3 be a bounded domain with c boundary we consider the shr dinger equation 1 q x u x a z x in where the real valued function q x is the potential z is the position of the point source and a rd 0 its amplitude assume that the kernel of the operator q x acting on h 10 is the trivial space associated with 1 we define the nonlinear dirichlet to neumann map dtn q a z h 1 2 h 1 2 by f u where u is the solution to 1 with the dirichlet condition u f on and is the unit outer normal vector of the nonlinear map f q a z f is an affine function it can be decomposed as q a z f q a z 0 q 0 0 f where le latter map is the classical linear dirichlet to neumann map

to evaluate the strength of the nonlinear dtn map due to the affine property of the map the trivial map 0 is the unique solution to the equation 0 the inverse problem we consider in this paper is to recover the triplet q a z from the knowledge of the nonlinear dtn map q a z it is well known that the inverse problem of determining only the potential while knowing the source is ill posed the uniqueness of this inverse problem is derived in 15 alessandrini proved that the stability estimate for this problem is of log type 1 and mandache showed that the log type stability is optimal for smooth potentials 11 for a given potential it is also well known that the identification of a general source function from full cauchy data is not possible indeed the authors in 2 showed that many boundary measurements are not sufficient to fully identify a general source moreover it turns out that increasing the number of boundary measurements does not increase the information concerning the source the identification may be achieved by considering many boundary measurements generated by different frequencies 5 6 unlike general source functions point sources are singular and has a lower dimensionality these specificities enable one to obtain uniqueness in the inverse source problem with a single cauchy observed data 3 many h lder type stability estimates have been derived for this inverse problem when the background medium is known and homogeneous 8 9 the inverse problem considered in this paper is quite new and only few partial results are available recently the authors in 14 established a h lder stability estimate on the reconstruction of point sources with respect to smooth changes of a known potential their results say that if the potential is known up to a small smooth perturbation the recovered source is close to the true one with respect to a given nonconventional distance not comparable to classical distances in sobolev spaces for example now we state the main result of the paper theorem 1 1 assume that q 1 a 1 z 1 and q 2 a 2 z 2 are two triplets with associated dtn nonlinear maps q 1 a 1 z 1 and 2 q 2 a 2 z 2 respectively let s d 2 1 and m 1 suppose qj hs m j 1 2 and supp q 1 q 2 then if q 1 a 1 z 1 2 q 2 a 2 z 2 1 the following stability estimate 2 a 1 z 1 a 1 z 2 h s rd q 1 q 2 h s rd c log q 1 a 1 z 1 2 q 2 a 2 z 2 s d 2 holds where c 0 depends only on s d and m the stability of reconstructing the potential and the point source is of logarithmic type this means that the inversion is ill posed and small variations in the measured data can lead to large errors in the recon structions the proof of theorem 1 1 is based on alessandrini s arguments in 1 and the complex geometrical optics cgo solutions constructed in 15 the main idea is to first recover the potential by exploiting the nonlinearity of the dtn map proposition 3 1 then the remaining inverse problem becomes a linear one and we again use cgo solutions to construct a new type of special solutions of the equation 1 in order to determine the position and amplitude of the point source lemma 3 2 using the same approach the obtained results can be extended to the inverse problem of recovering a potential and a finite number of point sources in the rest of the paper we introduce the cgo solutions in section 2 and prove the main result in section 3 2 complex geometrical optics solutions in this section we construct cgo solutions to the equation 1 by using the idea in 15 we recall the following fundamental results due to sylvester and uhlmann in 15 concerning solutions of the equation 3 w w f 3 where cd and 0 given cd with 2 and 0 define k k 1 k 2 i k for k rd where k stands for the fourier transform of the kernel k then for f h s rd s 0 with a compact support k f k f is a solution to the equation w w f in rd and k f k f h s rd lemma 2 1 15 let 1 0 cd with 2 and 0 and let f l 2 loc r d then 4 k f hs c f hs 1 for s 0 5 k f hs 1 c f hs 1 for s 0 for some positive constant c 0 that only depends on s and d here v l 2 1 2 v l 2 rd and v hs s 0 1 2 v l 2 rd these estimates are the corner stone of the proof of the uniqueness of smooth potentials 15 and of the proof of the stability estimates in 1 by using this lemma we can obtain a solution to the general equation q f 6 satisfying some decaying property as in the following lemma lemma 2 2 let s d 2 1 be an integer let cd satisfy 0 and 2 let f hs then there exists constants c 1 0 and c 2 0 depending only on d s and such that if c 1 q hs then there exists a solution hs to the equation 6 satisfying the estimates hs c 2 f hs 7 hs 1 c 2 f hs 8 proof let be a c compactly supported function satisfying 1 on a neighborhood of denote q 0 and f 0 respectively the extensions in h s rd of the functions q and

solution to the equation 6 in the whole space with f and q substituting f and q respectively lemma 2 1 shows that the linear operator k q is bounded from h s rd to itself let id be the identity operator from hs rd to itself the decaying behavior 5 implies that the operator k q is a contraction for large enough and hence id k q becomes invertible 4 gang bao yuantong liu and faouzi triki the estimates 7 and 8 follow immediately by taking the restriction of to the domain from the convergence of the neumann series id k q 1 k q p 0 k q p 1 for large and inequalities 9 the needed cgo solutions are constructed as follows proposition 2 1 let s d 2 be an integer let cd satisfy 0 and 2 define the constants c 1 and c 2 as in lemma 2 2 then if c 1 q hs then there exists a solution u to the equation 1 with the form of 10 u x exp 2 x 1 x where has the estimates hs c 2 q hs hs 1 c 2 q hs proof substituting 10 into 1 we have q q then by lemma 2 2 we obtain this proposition 3 proof of the stability estimate this section is devoted to the proof of theorem 1 1 for f h 1 2 let v be a solution to 11 q x v x 0 in and satisfying the dirichlet condition u f on and define linear map dtn 0 q h 1 2 h 1 2 by 0 f v we first observe that the following inequality q a z f q a z 0 0 q f 12 holds for all f h 1 2 proposition 3 1 assume that q 1 and q 2 are two potentials with associated dtn maps 0 q 1 and 0 q 2 respectively let s d 2 m 1 suppose qj hs m j 1 2 and supp q 1 q 2 then if 0 q 1 0 q 2 1 the following inequality 13 q 1 q 2 h s rd c log 0 q 1 0 q 2 s d 2 holds where c 0 only depends on d s and m let vj be a solution to 11 with q qj j 1 2 then we have q 2 q 1 v 1 v 2 dx 0 q 1 0 q 2 v 1 v 2 h 1 2 h 1 2 14 now we would like to estimate q 2 q 1 r d in terms of the boundary measurements the principal idea is to estimate the low frequencies using products of cgo s solutions and to approximate the high frequencies through the regularity of the difference 5 lemma 3 1 let s d 2 be an integer and m 1 assume ql hs m supp q 1 q 2 then there exist constants cm 1 such that the following inequality q 2 q 1 2 h s rd cm 1 r 2 s d exp cr 0 q 1 0 q 2 2 15 holds for all r 0 where c 0 only depends on s and d proof in the following proof c stands for a general constant strictly larger than one depending only on d s and by proposition 2 1 we can construct cgo solutions vj x to the equation 11 with q qj having the form of vj x exp j 2 x 1 j x for j 1 2 and we have q 2 q 1 exp 1 2 1 2 x 1 1 2 1 2 dx 0 q 1 0 q 2 v 1 v 2 h 1 2 h 1 2 16 from identity 14 where j satisfies j hs c j qj hs if j c d satisfies j j 0 j 2 and 17 j c 1 qj hs now let rd and 0 we assume that rd satisfy 18 0 and 2 2 2 define 1 and 2 as 1 i i and 2 i i then we have j j 0 j 2 2 2 2 2 2 l 1 2 and 1 2 1 2 i hence by 16 we immediately obtain that q 2 q 1 q 2 q 1 exp i x 1 2 1 2 dx 0 q 1 0 q 2 v 1 v 2 h 1 2 h 1 2 19 provided j 2 and 17 are satisfied suppose now that c 0 satisfies 1 near we first estimate the first term on the right hand side of 19 by q 2 q 1 exp i x 1 2 1 2 dx q 2 q 1 exp i x 1 2 1 2 dx q 2 q 1 h s 1 2 1 2 hs q 2 q 1 h s rd hs 1 hs 2 hs 1 hs 2 hs cm 2 q 2 q 1 h s rd 6 gang bao yuantong liu and faouzi triki on the other hand by straightforward calculations we have vj l 2 vj l 2 cm exp c for j 1 2 which by interpolation 12 provide vl h 1 2 cm exp c therefore we can estimate the second term of the right hand side of 19 by 0 q 1 0 q 2 v 1 v 2 h 1 2 h 1 2 v 1 h 1 2 v 2 h 1 2 0 q 1 0 q 2 cm 2 exp c 0 q 1 0 q 2 summing up we have shown that for rd if we take and satisfying the conditions 18 and 20 c 1 m 1 then q 2 q 1 cm 2 q 2 q 1 h s rd cm 2 exp c 0 q 1 0 q 2 21 holds integrating the last inequality with respect to over br 0 r d r and taking into account the fact that s d 2 we obtain br 0 q 2 q 1 2 1 2 sd cm 4 2 q 2 q 1 2 h s rd cm 4 exp c r 0 q 1 0 q 2 2 22 now since q 2 q 1 belong to h s rd we have q 2 q 1 2 h s rd br 0 q 2 q 1 2 1 2 sd cm 2 r 2 s d 23 taking m with 2 m c 1 m 1 2 2 c 2 m 4 and combining 23 and 22 we get q 2 q 1 2 h s rd cm 2 r 2 s d cm 4 exp c m r 0 q 1 0 q 2 2 cm 1 r 2 s d exp cr 0 q 1 0 q 2 2 which finishes the proof of the lemma now we shall prove proposition 3 1 proof since 2 s d 0 there exists a unique r 0 0 satisfying 1 r 2 s d 0 exp cr 0 0 q 1 0 q 2 2 where c 0 is the constant appearing in lemma 3 1 since log r r is bounded by e 1 for all r 0 we have r 0 2 log 0 q 1 0 q 2 c 2 s d e we deduce from the estimate 15 with r r 0 and the previous inequality q 2 q 1 2 h s rd 2 cm r 2 s d 0 2 cm 2 log 0 q 1 0 q 2 c 2 s d e 2 s d which achieves the proof of the proposition 7 next assuming that the potential q is known we identify the source a z from the knowledge of q a z 0 lemma 3 2 let s d 2 1 be an integer let cd satisfy 0 2 and e 1 0 there exist constants c 3 0 and c 4 0 that only depend on s and d such that if c 3 q hs then there exist solutions v and w to respectively the equations 1 and w log v 2 w 0 in with the form of v x exp 2 x 1 v x w x x w x 24 satisfying v 6 0 x 1 w 6 0 in where v and w have the estimates v hs c 4 q hs w hs c 4 q hs 25 in addition the function vw lies in hs and satisfies the equation 1 proof assuming that c 1 q hs we deduce from proposition 2 1 the existence of a solution v hs to the equation 1 with the form 24 and v verifying the following estimate v hs c 2 q hs 26 where c 1 and c 2 are as in lemma 2 2 since s d 2 1 hs is compactly embedded in c 1 and the inequality l c 0 hs 27 is valid for all hs where c 0 0 is a constant that only depends on s and d combining the last two inequalities we get v l 2 c 0 c 2 q hs since 0 taking max c 1 4 c 0 c 2 q hs leads to v 2 exp 2 x 0 since v 6 0 in we have log v 2 hs 1 and has the following decomposition log v 2 v 1 v let v h s rd be a compact supported extension of v to the whole space as in the proof of lemma 2 2 satisfying v hs rd c v hs 28 where c is a constant than only depends on s and d denote now w the solution to w w 1 1 v v w 1 1 v v in lemma 2 1 shows that the linear operator k 1 1 v v is bounded from h s rd to itself let id be the identity operator from hs rd to itself the decaying behavior 26 and the inequality 28 imply that the 8 gang bao yuantong liu and faouzi triki operator k 1 1 v v is a contraction for large enough and hence id k 1 1 v v becomes invertible in fact we have k 1 1 v v hs c 1 1 v v hs 1 1 c v hs hs rd c q hs hs rd for all hs rd and where c c c 0 only depends on s and d then w id k 1 1 v v 1 k 1 1 v v the second estimate 25 follows immediately by taking w the restriction of w to the domain from the convergence of the neumann series now we are ready to prove the main stability estimate in the following proof c stands for a general constant strictly larger than one depending only on d s and let 1 x v x v z 1 w x w z 2 w z 1 w z 2 29 2 x v x v z 2 w x w z 1 w z 2 w z 1 30 by construction the functions 1 and 2 are solutions to the equation 1 and satisfy i zj ij i j 1 2 where ij is the kronecker delta that is i zi 1 and i zj 0 if i 6 j moreover we have a 1 z 1 a 2 z 2 h s hs a 1 z 1 a 2 z 2 z 1 1 z 1 1 h s hs 31 for all hs here h s hs stands for the dual product between h s and hs then a 1 z 1 a 2 z 2 h s sup hs a 1 z 1 a 2 z 2 z 1 1 z 2 2 h s hs proposition 3 2 let i be defined as in 29 and 30 then there exists a constant c 0 that only depends on s and d such that the following inequality z 1 1 z 2 2 h 1 2 c hs is true for all hs proof we first prove that there exists a constant c 0 that only depends on s and d such that w z 2 w z 1 c z 2 z 1 32 9 indeed without loss of generality we can choose z 1 and z 2 on the line te 1 t r that is z 1 z 1 e 1 e 1 z 2 z 2 e 1 e 1 and z 2 z 1 e 1 z 2 z 1 e 1 hence w z 2 w z 1 e 1 z 2 z 1 w z 2 w z 1 33 since s d 2 1 we have w z 2 w z 1 c q hs z 2 z 1 34 combining equations 33 and 34 we get w z 2 w z 1 e 1 c q hs z 2 z 1 then by choosing e 1 0 large enough we obtain 32 back now to the proof of the proposition we have z 1 1 x z 2 2 x z 2 z 1 2 x z 1 1 x 2 x v x v z 2 z 2 z 1 w z 2 w z 1 w x w z 1 z 1 v x v z 1 z 1 v x 1 v x 2 1 v x 1 1 w z 2 w z 1 we finally deduce from the inequality 32 and the regularity of the functions v and w the desired inequality for j 1 2 let uj be the solution to the equation 1 with zero dirichlet boundary condition qj aj zj as a potential and a source respectively then u u 2 u 1 is a solution to q 2 x u x a 2 z 2 x a 1 z 1 x u 1 x q 1 x q 2 x in for a given test function hs multiplying the previous equation by z 1 1 z 2 2 and integrating by parts we obtain a 1 z 1 a 2 z 2 h s hs u h 1 2 z 1 1 z 2 2 h 1 2 q 2 q 1 h s rd u 1 hs hs combining the results of propositions 3 2 and 3 1 we finish the proof of the main stability estimate references 1 g alessandrini stable determination
