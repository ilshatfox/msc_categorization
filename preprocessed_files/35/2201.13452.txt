statistics washington state university pullman wa 99164 usa and jun zou department of mathematics the chinese university of hong kong shatin n t hong kong abstract in this paper we study a nonlinear reaction diffusion system which models an in fectious disease caused by bacteria such as those for cholera one of the significant features in this model is that a certain portion of the recovered human hosts may lose a lifetime immunity and could be infected again another important feature in the model is that the mobility for each species is allowed to be dependent upon both the location and time with the whole population assumed to be susceptible with the bac teria the model is a strongly coupled nonlinear reaction diffusion system we prove that the nonlinear system has a unique solution globally in any space dimension under some natural conditions on the model parameters and the given data moreover the long time behavior and stability analysis for the solutions are carried out rigorously in particular we characterize the precise conditions on variable parameters about the sta bility or instability of all steady state solutions these new results provide the answers to

sciences researchers have a great deal of interest to establish a suitable mathematical model for various infectious diseases the current global pandemic attracts even more scientists to this field there are many different mathematical models for an infectious disease in the literature roughly speaking these models can be divided by two categories a data based discrete model and a continuous model based on a population growth see 15 43 48 our approach is based on a continuous model which provides a much more convenient tool to analyze the complicated dynamics of the interac tion among susceptible infected and recovered patients a continuous model is typically governed by a system of ordinary differential equations ode model or a system of partial differential equations pde model for an ode model a monumental work was done in 1927 by kermack and mckendrick 34 since then a significant progress has been made in modeling and analyzing various infectious diseases such as sir seir models and their various extensions an ode model often provides a clear and precise description of physical quantities and their relations by using an ode model one can study detailed dynamical interaction between viruses and various species as well as other qualitative properties such as reproduction numbers this type of ode models is widely adopted and used by researchers in all fields particularly those in biological and health sciences on the other hand when one takes the movement of species across different geographical regions into consideration it is necessary to include a diffusion process in a mathematical model to reflect the movement this leads to modeling an infectious disease by using a system of partial differential equa tions pdes often called reaction diffusion equations a well known work 17 discussed a number of pde models arising from biological ecological and animal sciences and explained why the pde approach is more appropriate in those areas there are a large number of research studies conference proceedings and monograph in both pde and ode models in the literature we list only some of them here as examples e g 2 3 11 18 35 for the sir ode models and 1 13 17 24 32 41 for the sir pde models many more references can be found in a siam review paper by hethcote 23 and the monograph by busenberg and cooke 7 cantres and cosner 8 daley and gani 11 lou and ni 32 etc it is worth noting from the mathematical point of view that the pde models present significant more challenges for scientists to study the dynamics of the solutions and to analyze qualitative properties of the solutions many important mathematical questions such as global existence and uniqueness are still open for some popular pde models this is one of the motivations for the current study 2 in this paper we consider a mathematical model in a heterogeneous domain for an in fectious disease caused by bacteria such as cholera without lifetime immunity without considering the diffusion process of the population the ode models have been studied ex tensively see e g 4 7 18 19 the model considered in this work is a direct extension of the ode model to describe the mathematical model we introduce the following variables s x t susceptible population concentration at location x and time t i x t infected population concentration at location x and time t r x t recovered population concentration at location x and time t b x t concentration of bacteria at location x and t we assume that the whole population is susceptible to the bacteria moreover the rate of growth for the population denoted by b x t s depends on location time and the population itself a classical example for b is that the population growth follows a logistic growth model with a maximum capacity k 1 0 b x t s b 0 s 1 s k 1 where b 0 0 represents the growth rate of the population the population reduction caused by infected patients is denoted by a nonlinear function g 1 x t s i b which is nonnegative a typical form of the nonlinear function g 1 is given by see 51 54 g 1 x t s i b 1 si 2 sh 1 b h 1 b b b k 2 where 1 2 are positive transmission parameters and h 1 b represents the maximum satu ration rate of bacteria on human hosts and k 2 0 the bacteria growth follows the same assumption denoted by g 2 x t s with a maximum capacity k 3 0 g 2 x t s g 0 s 1 s k 3 where g 0 0 is the growth rate of the bacteria we also assume that the diffusion coefficients depend on location and time by extending the ode model see 7 18 30 etc we obtain the following reaction diffusion system st a 1 x t s b x t s g 1 x t s i b d 1 s r 1 1 it a 2 x t i g 1 x t s i b d 2 i 1 2 rt a 3 x t r i d 3 r 1 3 bt a 4 x t b i g 2 x t b d 4 b 1 4 3 the biological meaning of various parameters and functions in the model are given below see 19 49 50 ai the diffusion coefficients i 1 2 3 4 the recovery rate of infectious individuals the rate at which recovered individuals lose immunity di the natural death rate of species or bacteria the shedding rate of bacteria by infectious human hosts to complete the mathematical model we assume that the system 1 1 1 4 holds in qt 0 t for any t 0 where is a bounded domain in rn with c 2 boundary the initial concentrations for all species are known and we assume that no species can cross the boundary this leads to the following initial and boundary conditions s i r b 0 x t 0 t 1 5 s x 0 i x 0 r x 0 b x 0 s 0 x i 0 x r 0 x b 0 x x 1 6 where represents the outward unit normal on we would like to give a short review about the known results for the above model for the ode system corresponding to 1 1 1 4 there are many studies for various interesting mathematical problems such as global existences dynamical interaction between the bacte ria and species see e g 4 18 19 45 the stability analysis is also carried out by several researchers see 30 39 44 etc when the movement of species is considered in the model the corresponding pde system is much more complicated to study this is due to the fact that the maximum principle can not be applied for a system of reaction diffusion equations it is a challenge to establish the global well posedness for the pde system 1 1 1 6 nev ertheless when the space dimension is equal to 1 under certain conditions on g 1 and g 2 the global existence is established see 49 50 51 52 the reason is that the total population is bounded in l 1 which implies a global boundedness for s x t by using sobolev em bedding for the space dimension n 1 however this method does not work when the space dimension n is greater than 1 in a siam review article 37 the authors considered the following system with a and b being two positive constants ut a u f u v x t 0 vt b v g u v x t 0 4 subject to appropriate initial and boundary conditions suppose f 0 v g u 0 0 for all u v 0 then under the condition that f u v g u v 0 the l 1 norms of the nonnegative solutions u and v are bounded i e sup t 0 u v dx c however the solution u v may blow up in finite time when the space dimension is greater than 1 if no additional conditions on f u v and g u v are made therefore as indicated in 37 one must impose some additional conditions in order to obtain a global bound for a reaction diffusion system there are some interesting results for a general reaction diffusion system when leading coefficients are constants in 2000 under certain additional conditions pierre schmitt 37 introduced a dual method to establish such a bound for the reaction diffusion system in 2007 desvillettes fellner pierre vovelle introduced in 12 an entropy condition originated by kanel in 1990 25 and extended the dual method to a more general reaction diffusion system with constant diffusion coefficients and established the global bound with a quadratic growth reaction as long as a total mass is controlled l 1 boundedness in 2009 caputo vasseur 10 extended the entropy method to establish a global existence for a reaction diffusion system where the nonlinear reaction terms grow at most sub quadratically one can see an interesting review by m pierre in 2010 38 caceres canizo extended in 2017 9 to the case where the reaction terms grow at most quadratically under certain conditions on the steady state solutions in 2018 souplet 42 established the global well posedness for a reaction diffusion system with quadratic growth in the reaction very recently some considerable progress was made for a reaction diffusion system by fellner morgan tang in 2019 22 and morgan tang in 2020 33 they are able to derive a global bound for the solution of a reaction diffusion as long as the diffusion coefficients are smooth and nonlinear reaction terms in the system satisfy a condition called an intermediate growth condition which replaces the entropy condition their approach is based on a combination of the dual method and the entropy method in 2021 fitzgibbon morgan tang yin 14 studied a very general reaction diffusion system with a controlled mass and nonsmooth diffusion coefficients they established the global well posedness for the system with at most a polynomial growth for reactions moreover several interesting examples as applications arising from biological health sciences and chemical reactive flow were studied in the paper those results made a substantial progress for a general reaction diffusion system with a controlled mass however 5 due to the nonlinearity in eq 1 1 these results do not cover the nonlinear system 1 1 1 4 particularly we do not have growth conditions here on g 1 with respect to s 1 s 2 s 3 for the global existence see theorem 2 1 in section 2 the purpose of this paper has twofold the first purpose is to establish the existence of a global solution to the generalized system 1 1 1 6 in any space dimension without any restriction on parameters nor growth conditions with respect to si for g 1 this extends a result obtained by the first author in his recent work 54 our method in this paper is based on some key ideas developed in 54 the special structure of the system 1 1 1 4 will also play a key role we shall also use various techniques from the theories of elliptic and parabolic equations see 20 31 36 to derive an a priori bound we use a crucial result for a linear parabolic equation in the campanato john nirenberg morrey space from 53 which extends the digoigi nash s estimate with weaker conditions for nonhomogeneous terms the other purpose of the current work is to present the stability analysis of all steady state solutions which was not addressed in 54 in particular for the following classical choices of the growth model 8 b x t s b 0 s 1 s k 1 g 1 x t s i b 1 si 2 sh 1 b h 1 b b b k 2 1 7 g 2 b g 0 b 1 b k 2 1 8 we are able to precisely describe what conditions are needed for a steady state solution to be stable or unstable roughly speaking we shall demonstrate that under the conditions d 1 b 0 d 2 0 d 3 0 d 4 g 0 the steady state solution is stable on the other hand if either d 1 b 0 or d 4 g 0 then we can choose a set of suitable values for parameters 1 and 2 such that the steady state solution is unstable this implies that our stability conditions are optimal this stabil ity analysis provides some important guidance to practitioners and scientists in biological ecological and health sciences the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we first recall some function spaces which are frequently used in the subsequent analysis and then state our main results in section 3 we prove the first part of the main results on global solvability of the system 1 1 1 6 theorem 2 1 and corollary 2 1 in section 4 we focus on a general stability analysis and obtain the sufficient conditions on parameters which ensure the stability of a steady state solution in section 5 for a set of concrete functions b x t s h 1 s and g 2 x t s we give 6 precisely conditions on the model parameters under which a steady state solution is stable or unstable finally some concluding remarks are given in section 6 throughout the paper we shall use c with or without subscript for a generic constant depending only on the given data in the model including the upper bound of the terminal time t and it may take a different value at each occurrence 2 preliminaries and statement of main results for reader s convenience we recall some standard function spaces which will be used fre quently in the subsequent analysis for 0 1 we denote by c or c 2 q t the ho lder space in which every function is ho lder continuous with respect to x or x t with exponent in or 2 in q t for t we write qt 0 t as q 0 for p 1 and a banach space v with norm v we define lp 0 t v f t t 0 t v f lp 0 t v equipped with the norm f lp 0 t v t 0 f pvdt 1 p when v lp we simply write lp qt l p 0 t lp with its norm as p sobolev spaces w k p and w k lp qt are defined the same as in the classical references see e g 20 let v 2 qt u c 0 t w 1 02 u v 2 see 36 equipped with the norm u v 2 max 0 t t u l 2 n i 1 uxi l 2 qt we will also use the campanato john nirenberg morry space l 2 qt which is defined as a subspace of l 2 qt with its norm given by u l 2 qt u l 2 qt u 2 qt where u 2 qt sup 0 z 0 qt q z 0 u uq 2 dxdt 1 2 with z 0 x 0 t 0 q z 0 b x 0 t 0 2 t 0 and uq representing the average of u over q z 0 for any q z 0 qt see troianiello 46 for its detailed definition and properties 7 an important fact of the space is that l 2 2 qt is equivalent to c 2 q t with n 2 if n n 2 lemma 1 19 in 46 we shall write the norm of l 2 qt as u 2 we first state the basic assumptions for the diffusion coefficients and the known data involved in our model 1 1 1 4 all other model parameters are assumed to be positive constants throughout this paper one can easily extend the well posedness results to more general system when those parameters are functions of x t as long as the basic structure of the system is preserved h 2 1 assume that ai l q there exist two positive constants a 0 and a 0 such that 0 a 0 ai x t a 0 x t qt i 1 2 3 4 h 2 2 assume that all initial data u 0 x s 0 x i 0 x r 0 x b 0 x are nonnegative on moreover u 0 x l 2 0 4 with 0 n 2 n h 2 3 a let b x t s di x t s and g 2 x t s be measurable in q r and locally lipschitz continuous with respect to s and 0 b x t 0 di x t 0 l q moreover it holds for some m 0 that di x t s d 0 0 bs x t s b 0 x t s q m b let g 1 x t s 1 s 2 s 3 be measurable in q r 3 and nonnegative differentiable with respect to s 1 s 2 s 3 and g 1 x t 0 s 2 s 3 0 s 2 s 3 0 g 2 x t 0 0 g 2 s x t s g 0 x t s q r where k 1 k 2 and k 3 represent the maximum capacity of the general population the infected population and the bacteria respectively for convenience we set u x t u 1 u 2 u 3 u 4 to be a vector valued function defined in qt with u 1 x t s x t u 2 x t i x t u 3 x t r x t u 4 x t b x t x t qt the right hand sides of the equations 1 1 1 4 are denoted by f 1 x t u f 2 x t u f 3 x t u and f 4 x t u respectively with the new notation the system 1 1 1 6 can 8 be written as the following reaction diffusion system u 1 t a 1 x t u 1 f 1 x t u x t qt 2 1 u 2 t a 2 x t u 2 f 2 x t u x t qt 2 2 u 3 t a 3 x t u 3 f 3 x t u x t qt 2 3 u 4 t a 4 x t u 4 f 4 x t u x t qt 2 4 subject to the initial and boundary conditions u x 0 u 0 x s 0 x i 0 x r 0 x b 0 x x 2 5 u x t 0 x t 0 t 2 6 we define x v 2 qt l qt definition 2 1 we say u x t x 4 is a weak solution to the problem 2 1 2 6 in qt if it holds for all functions k x with kt l 2 qt k x t 0 on for k 1 2 3 4 t 0 uk kt ak uk k dxdt uk x 0 k x 0 dx t 0 fk x t u k x t dxdt theorem 2 1 under the assumptions h 2 1 h 2 3 the problem 2 1 2 6 has a weak solution in x and the weak solution is nonnegative and bounded in qt for any t 0 moreover it holds that ui x t c 2 q t for i 1 2 3 4 under some additional conditions on b and g 2 we can deduce an uniform bound of the weak solution to the problem 2 1 2 6 in q we state such a result for the special case which is needed in the subsequent asymptotic analysis corollary 2 1 under the conditions h 2 1 2 2 we further assume bs x t s d 0 0 g 2 s x s d 4 0 0 x t s q 0 and 0 b 0 x t dxdt then the weak solution of the problem 2 1 2 6 is bounded globally in q 9 remark 2 1 the weak solution obtained in theorem 2 1 may grow to infinity as t if there is no additional conditions imposed on b x t s g 2 x t s and d 1 x t s d 4 x t s on the other hand if one assumes that g 1 and g 2 grow at most in a polynomial power with respect to si then one can verify that the conditions in 14 hold consequently a global bound in q can be deduced the next theorem states our main stability results for the steady state solutions to the problem 2 1 2 6 theorem 2 2 under the condition h 4 1 see section 4 a steady state solution is asymp totically stable if d 1 b 0 d 4 g 0 and the parameters 1 2 are appropriately small where b 0 and g 0 are constants which depend on the steady state solution it turns out that the conditions in theorem 2 2 are almost necessary in order to ensure the stability of each steady state solution in section 5 we will see that when b x t s g 1 and g 2 x t s are of the form in 1 7 1 8 then we have a very precise set of conditions for the model parameters to ensure the local stability or instability for each steady state solution to avoid repetitions we state this result in section 5 since there are many specific cases we have to consider 3 global solvability and proof of theorem 2 1 in this section we first derive some a priori estimates for a weak solution to the system 2 1 2 6 then show the existence of a unique weak solution finally we establish the global boundedness and the ho lder continuity lemma 3 1 under the assumptions h 2 1 2 2 a weak solution of the system 2 1 2 6 is nonnegative this is a well known result since each fi x t u 1 u 2 u 3 u 4 is quasi positive for i 1 2 3 4 and is also locally lipschitz continuous with respect to each uk for k 1 2 3 4 interested readers may refer to 5 for a detailed proof next we apply the energy method to derive an a priori estimate in the space v 2 qt 10 lemma 3 2 under the assumptions h 2 1 2 3 there exists a constant c 1 such that 4 k 1 uk v 2 qt c 1 proof we multiply eq 1 1 by u 1 and integrate over to obtain 1 2 d dt u 2 1 dx a 0 u 1 2 dx g 1 u 1 dx d 0 u 2 1 dx b x t u 1 u 1 dx u 1 u 3 dx c 1 u 21 dx c u 21 u 2 3 dx where we have used the assumption h 2 3 a at the second estimate we can perform a similar energy estimate for eq 1 3 to deduce 1 2 d dt u 23 dx a 0 u 3 2 dx u 2 u 3 dx c u 22 u 2 3 dx in order to derive an estimate for u 2 we make use of the special structure of the system 2 1 2 4 to do so we define v x t u 1 x t u 2 x t x t q then it is easy to see that v x t satisfies vt d 2 v d 1 d 2 u 1 f 1 x t u f 2 x t u x t qt 3 1 v x t 0 x t 0 t 3 2 v x 0 s 0 x i 0 x x 3 3 we multiply eq 3 1 by v and then integrate over to obtain 1 2 d dt v 2 dx a 0 v 2 dx d 1 d 2 u 1 v dx v f 1 x t u f 2 x t u dx j 1 j 2 a direct application of the cauchy schwarz s inequality implies j 1 v 2 dx c u 1 2 dx 11 on the other hand using the fact that f 1 x t u f 2 x t u b x t u 1 d 1 u 1 u 3 d 3 u 2 we readily derive that j 2 v f 1 x t u f 2 x t u dx c v 1 u 1 u 3 dx c c v 2 u 21 u 2 3 dx now choosing a 0 2 we can readily derive from the above estimates that d dt v 2 dx a 0 v 2 dx c c v 2 u 21 u 2 3 dx by combining the above energy estimates for u 1 v and u 3 we can further deduce d dt u 21 v 2 u 23 dx u 1 2 v 2 u 3 3 dx c u 21 v 2 2 u 2 3 dx then a direct application of gronwall s inequality implies sup 0 t t u 21 v 2 u 23 dx t 0 u 1 2 v 2 u 3 3 dxdt c c s 20 i 2 0 r 2 0 dx noting that v u 1 u 2 we can write v 2 dx u 1 2 u 2 2 dx 2 u 1 u 2 dx but using the cauchy schwarz s inequality we can see u 1 u 2 dx u 2 2 dx c u 1 2 dx u 2 2 dx c u 21 u 2 3 dx using the above estimates and choosing to be sufficiently small we can obtain u 21 u 2 2 u 2 3 dx qt u 1 2 u 2 2 u 3 2 dxdt c c s 20 i 2 0 r 2 0 dx 12 for u 4 we note that h 2 x t u 4 u 4 k 0 u 24 1 then we can readily derive from eq 2 4 that d dt u 24 dx a 0 u 4 2 dx c u 22 u 2 4 dx now an integration over 0 t implies sup 0 t t u 24 dx qt u 4 2 dxdt c c b 20 dx c qt u 22 dxdt c c s 20 i 2 0 r 2 0 b 2 0 dx this proof of lemma 3 2 is now completed q e d in order to derive more a priori estimats we need a crucial result about the camapanto john nirenberg morrey estimate for a general parabolic equation for reader s convenience we state the result in detail here see lemma 3 3 below consider the parabolic equation ut lu n i 1 fi x t xi f x t x t qt 3 4 u x t 0 or u x t 0 x t 0 t 3 5 u x 0 u 0 x x 3 6 where lu aij x t uxi xj bi x t uxi c x t is an elliptic operator we assume there are positive constants a 1 a 2 and a 3 such that a aij x t n n is a positive definite matrix that satisfies a 0 2 aij i j a 1 2 rn and n i 1 bi l qt c l qt a 2 lemma 3 3 53 let u x t be a weak solution of the parabolic equation 3 8 3 10 let u 0 c with u 0 x 0 on and u 0 l 2 0 for some 0 n 2 n then for any 0 n there exists a constant c such that u l 2 qt c u 0 l 2 2 f l 2 2 n i 1 fi l 2 qt 13 moreover it holds that u l 2 2 qt and u l 2 2 qt c u 0 l 2 2 f l 2 2 n i 1 fi l 2 qt for a constant c that depends only on a 0 a 1 a 2 n and qt lemma 3 4 under the assumptions h 2 1 2 3 the weak solution of 2 1 2 4 satisfies 4 k 1 uk c 2 q t c t proof let 0 n be arbitrary by lemma 3 3 we have u 3 l 2 qt c r 0 l 2 2 u 2 l 2 2 qt u 3 l 2 2 qt 3 7 on the other hand we note that v x t u 1 x t u 2 x t satisfies the system 3 1 3 3 so we can apply lemma 3 3 again to obtain v l 2 qt c v 0 l 2 2 3 i 1 ui l 2 2 qt 3 8 to derive the l 2 estimate for u 1 we note that u 1 t a 1 x t u 1 b x t u 1 d 1 u 1 u 3 bs x t d 1 u 1 b x t 0 u 3 where is the mean value between 0 and u 1 using the facts that bs x t s and b x t 0 are bounded we can use the same calculations as in lemmas 3 2 and 3 3 to obtain u 1 l 2 qt c s 0 l 2 u 3 l 2 qt now we can combine the l 2 qt estimates for u 1 v and u 3 and note that v u 1 u 2 to obtain for any 0 n that 3 i 1 ui l 2 c u 0 l 2 2 3 i 1 ui l 2 2 qt c 3 9 using the fact that ui v 2 qt we derive for any 1 0 2 that 3 i 1 ui l 2 1 qt c 3 i 1 ui 0 l 2 1 3 10 14 now we can apply the interpolation theory for the parabolic equation 2 3 see lemma 2 6 in 53 to further deduce u 3 l 2 1 2 c u 2 l 2 u 3 l 2 u 3 l 2 qt c next we go back to the system 2 1 2 3 and apply the same process for 2 1 2 to obtain 3 i 1 ui 2 2 qt c 3 i 1 ui 0 l 2 2 3 i 1 ui 2 2 2 qt c 3 11 then after a finite number of steps we can deduce for any 0 n that 3 i 1 ui l 2 2 c 3 i 1 ui l 2 ui 0 l 2 2 2 c 3 i 1 ui l 2 qt 3 i 1 ui 0 l 2 2 3 12 now we apply the interpolation theory again see lemma 2 6 in 53 to derive 3 i 1 ui 2 0 4 qt c 3 i 1 ui l 2 qt 3 i 1 ui 0 l 2 0 but noting that 0 n 2 n we can then obtain by lemma 1 19 in 46 that 3 i 1 ui c 2 q t c for 0 2 n 2 the proof of lemma 3 5 is now completed q e d proof of theorem 2 1 first of all by using the energy method we see that the weak solution of 2 1 2 6 must be unique since the solution is bounded and fk is locally lipschitz continuous with respect to ui for all k i 1 2 3 4 with the a priori estimates in lemmas 3 1 3 4 there are several approaches such as the truncation method and galerkin finite element method to prove the desired result see e g 5 14 54 here we choose a different approach the bootstrap argument see 55 for the proof let t 0 be any fixed number it is easy to show that the system 2 1 2 6 has a unique local weak solution in x in qt 0 for some small t 0 0 let t sup t 0 the system 2 1 2 6 has a unique weak solution in qt 0 15 suppose t t otherwise nothing is needed to prove we note that the a priori estimates in lemmas 3 1 and 3 4 hold for any weak solution it follows that lim t t sup 4 k 1 uk v 2 qt 4 k 1 uk c 2 q t by the compactness we know that uk x t h 1 uk l 2 2 for any n n 2 now we use u x t as an initial value and consider the system 2 1 2 6 for t t then the local existence result implies that there exists a small t 0 0 such that the problem 2 1 2 6 has a unique weak solution in the interval t t t 0 consequently we obtain a weak solution to the system 2 1 2 6 in the interval 0 t t 0 this is a contradiction with the definition of t therefore we have t t q e d next we prove corollary 2 1 assume that there exists a constant 0 0 such that d 1 x t s bs x t s 0 0 d 4 x t s g 2 s x t s 0 x t s q 0 with the above assumption we take the integration over for eq 2 1 2 3 to obtain d dt u 1 u 2 u 3 dx min d 0 0 u 1 u 2 u 3 dx b x t 0 dx then it is easy to see sup t 0 u 1 u 2 u 3 dx c now we derive a uniform estimate in l 2 q by using the energy estimate for eq 2 1 we can see that d dt u 21 dx u 1 2 dx c b x t 0 2 dx c u 23 dx for v x t u 1 x t u 2 x t we can derive from eq 3 1 3 3 that d dt v 2 dx v 2 dx c u 1 2 dx c b x t 0 2 u 21 u 2 3 dx c b x t 0 2 u 21 u 2 3 dx where we have used the estimate of u 1 at the second estimate 16 again we can use the energy estimate for eq 2 3 to obtain d dt u 23 dx u 3 2 dx c u 22 dx but we know from the gagliardo nirenberg estimate for p q 2 s 1 n n 2 and 0 u 2 dx u 2 dx c u l 1 then using the uniformly boundedness of l 1 norms of u 1 u 2 u 3 we get for sufficiently small sup t 0 u 21 u 2 2 u 2 3 dx t 0 u 1 2 u 2 2 u 3 2 dx c 1 c 2 t 0 b x t 0 2 dxdt c 3 next we use the iteration method again as in the proof of theorem 2 1 from eq 3 2 for v and u 3 we deduce respectively v 2 c c u 1 2 c u 3 2 and u 3 2 c c u 2 2 for u 1 we see by noting that g 1 0 u 1 t a 1 x t u 1 b 0 x t d 1 u 1 u 3 as u 1 0 in q we can follow the same argument as in 53 to obtain for n 2 n u 1 2 c c u 1 2 u 3 2 as u 1 v u 3 are uniformly bounded in l 2 q the interpolation for v and u 3 with 0 yields that v 2 2 u 3 2 2 c hence we can obtain the l 2 q estimate for u 1 with 2 u 1 2 2 c c u 1 2 2 u 2 2 2 which is uniformly bounded 17 we can now go back to the equations for v and u 3 with 2 to obtain v 2 4 u 3 2 4 c u 1 2 2 u 2 2 2 u 3 2 2 by continuing the above iteration process after a finite number of steps we obtain for 0 n 2 that v c 2 q t u 3 c 2 q t c consequently we get u 1 l q c once we know that u 2 is uniformly bounded then from eq 2 4 we can apply the maximum principle to obtain sup t 0 u 4 l c with the a priori bound for each ui we can extend the weak solution in qt to q q e d 4 linear stability analysis to illustrate the main idea we assume that b and g 2 depend only on x and s we also focus on the following model cases b x t s b 0 x s 1 s k 1 g 1 1 u 1 u 2 2 u 1 u 4 u 4 k 2 g 2 g 0 x s 1 s k 3 moreover we assume that all parameters 1 2 di ki are positive constants the general case can be carried out similarly as long as the functions are differentiable consider the steady state problem in a 1 x u 1 b x u 1 g 1 x u 1 u 2 u 4 d 1 u 1 u 3 4 1 a 2 x u 2 g 1 x u 1 u 2 u 4 d 2 u 2 4 2 a 3 x u 3 u 2 d 3 u 3 4 3 a 4 x u 4 u 2 g 2 x u 4 d 4 u 4 4 4 subject to the boundary condition u x 0 x 4 5 where u x u 1 x u 2 x u 3 x u 4 x 18 it is clear that there is a trivial solution u x 0 0 0 0 if b x 0 g 1 x 0 g 2 x 0 0 but we are interested in nontrivial solutions and will make the following assumptions h 4 1 a 0 a 0 ai x a 0 on b b 0 x b 1 0 and g 0 x g 1 0 and both are bounded lemma 4 1 under the assumptions h 4 1 the elliptic system 4 1 4 5 has at least one nonnegative weak solution u x w 1 2 moreover the weak solution is ho lder continuous in for any space dimension proof since the argument is very similar to the case for a parabolic system we only sketch the proof the key step is to derive an a priori estimate in ho lder space as a first step we know that a solution of 4 1 4 5 must be nonnegative since every right hand side of 4 1 to 4 4 is quasi positive next we can use the same argument as for the parabolic case to derive l 1 estimate for ui x 0 i 1 2 3 4 on indeed by direct integration we have d 2 u 2 d 3 u 3 dx b 0 x u 2 1 dx b 0 d 1 u 1 dx then an application of the cauchy schwarz s inequality yields u 21 d 2 u 2 d 3 u 3 dx c on the other hand we obtain from eq 4 1 that g 0 u 24 dx u 2 dx g 0 g 0 d 4 u 4 dx c g 0 2 u 24 dx which implies u 24 dx c next step is to derive the l 2 estimate for u 2 and u 3 the idea is very much similar to the case for a parabolic system the energy estimate for eq 4 1 yields that for any 0 u 1 2 dx u 31 dx c u 23 dx it is easy to see that by adding up eq 4 1 and eq 4 2 v x u 1 x u 2 x satisfies that a 2 x v a 1 x a 2 x u 1 b x u 1 d 1 u 1 d 2 u 2 u 3 then we can get by the energy estimate that v 2 dx v 2 dx c 2 u 23 dx 19 from eq 4 3 we have by using cauchy schwarz s inequality that a 0 u 3 2 dx d 3 u 23 dx u 2 u 3 dx d 3 2 u 2 3 dx 2 d 3 u 2 2 dx which implies u 3 2 dx u 23 dx c u 22 dx now we can combine the above estimates for u 1 v and u 3 and choose sufficiently small to conclude 4 i 1 ui l 2 4 i 1 u 2 idx c 4 6 to derive a further a priori estimate we use the campanato estimate for elliptic equations 46 to obtain that ui c and 4 i 1 ui c c with the above a priori estimates we can use the schauder s fixed point theorem 21 to obtain the existence of a weak solution for the system 4 1 4 5 and the weak solution is in the space w 1 2 c we skip this step here q e d remark 4 1 the uniqueness is not expected in general since one can see that there are many nontrivial constant solutions when b 1 x s g 1 g 2 have the special forms as stated in the introduction next we shall consider the steady state solutions to the system 4 1 4 5 let z x u 1 x u 2 x u 3 x u 4 x be such a steady state solution for 0 we consider a small perturbation near z x and set z x t z x z 1 x t x t q where z 1 x t u 1 x t u 2 x t u 3 x t u 4 x t with ui x t ui x t u i x for i 1 2 3 4 a direct calculation shows that z 1 satisfies the following linear system u 1 t a 1 u 1 f 1 z 1 x t q 4 6 u 2 t a 2 u 2 f 2 z 1 x t q 4 7 u 3 t a 3 u 3 f 3 z 1 x t q 4 8 u 4 t a 4 u 4 f 4 z 1 x t q 4 9 20 subject to the initial and boundary conditions z 1 x 0 z 1 x 0 x 4 10 z 1 x t 0 x t 0 4 11 where the right hand sides of the system 4 6 4 9 are given by f 1 z 1 bs x u 1 1 u 2 2 h 1 u 4 d 1 u 1 1 u 1 u 2 u 3 2 u 1 h 1 u 4 u 4 f 2 z 1 1 u 2 2 h 1 u 20 u 1 1 u 1 d 2 u 2 2 u 1 h 1 u 4 u 4 f 3 z 1 u 2 d 3 u 3 f 4 z 1 u 2 h 2 s x u 4 u 4 theorem 4 1 under the assumptions h 4 1 the steady state solution z x to the system 4 1 4 5 is asymptotically stable if the following conditions hold d 1 b 0 0 d 4 g 0 0 and 1 is suitably small where b 0 and g 0 are given by b 0 max x bs x u 1 g 0 max h 2 s x u 4 proof for any positive integer k we multiply eq 4 1 by uk 1 and integrate over to obtain 1 k 1 d dt uk 11 dx 4 a 0 k 1 2 u k 1 2 1 2 dx d 1 1 u 2 2 h 1 u 4 bs x u 1 uk 11 dx j where j is given by j 1 u 1 u 2 u k 1 dx u 3 u k 1 dx 2 u 1 h 1 u 4 u 4 u k 1 dx j 1 j 2 j 3 let u 0 max u 1 x then we can use the young s inequality to readily get j 1 1 u 0 k k 1 uk 11 1 k 1 uk 12 dx j 2 k k 1 uk 11 1 k 1 uk 13 dx j 3 2 u 0 g 0 k k 1 uk 11 1 k 1 uk 14 dx 21 now we can easily see for sufficiently small 1 2 that 1 k 1 d dt uk 11 dx 4 a 0 k 1 2 u k 1 2 1 2 dx d 1 1 u 2 2 h 1 u 4 bs x u 1 uk 11 dx c k 1 u k 1 2 u k 1 3 u k 1 4 dx we can apply the same argument above for u 2 u 3 u 4 from eq 4 2 eq 4 3 and eq 4 4 respectively to obtain 1 k 1 d dt uk 12 dx 4 a 0 k 1 2 u k 1 2 2 2 dx d 2 1 u 0 uk 12 dx c k 1 uk 11 u k 1 4 dx 1 k 1 d dt uk 13 dx 4 a 0 k 1 2 u k 1 2 3 2 dx d 3 uk 13 dx c k 1 uk 12 dx 1 k 1 d dt uk 14 dx 4 a 0 k 1 2 u k 1 2 4 2 dx d 4 g 0 uk 14 dx c k 1 uk 12 dx we now look at the quantity y t uk 11 u k 1 2 u k 1 3 u k 1 4 dx noting from the assumption h 4 1 that there exists a small number denoted by 0 such that d 1 b 0 0 d 2 1 u 0 0 d 3 0 d 4 g 0 0 we can add up the above estimates for uk 1 i to derive for sufficiently large k that 1 k 1 y t 0 y t 0 this readily implies y t c k 1 y 0 taking the kth root on both sides we obtain as k that 4 i 1 sup 0 t ui l sup z 1 x 0 l 22 this implies that the solution z 1 x t is asymptotically stable near the steady state solution z x q e d 5 further stability analysis in this section we investigate the stability of constant steady state solutions corresponding to the system 1 1 1 4 to illustrate the method and physical meaning we further assume that the diffusion coefficients and the death rate are constants h 5 1 a let ai and di be positive constants and a 0 min a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 d 0 min d 1 d 2 d 3 d 4 b functions b h 1 and h 2 are of the following forms for two constants b 0 and g 0 b x t s b 0 s 1 s k 1 h 1 s s s k 2 h 2 s g 0 s 1 s k 3 consider the corresponding steady state system in a 1 x u 1 b x u 1 1 u 1 u 2 2 u 1 h 1 u 4 d 1 u 1 u 3 5 1 a 2 x u 2 1 u 1 u 2 2 u 1 h 1 u 4 d 2 u 2 5 2 a 3 x u 3 u 2 d 3 u 3 5 3 a 4 x u 4 u 2 h 2 x u 4 d 4 u 4 5 4 subject to the boundary condition u x 0 x 5 5 where u x u 1 x u 2 x u 3 x u 4 x we can easily derive from 5 1 to 5 4 that d 1 b 0 u 1 dx d 2 u 2 dx d 3 u 3 dx b 0 k 1 u 21 dx 0 d 4 g 0 u 4 dx g 0 k 2 u 24 dx u 2 dx from which we readily see that there exists one trivial solution i e u 1 u 2 u 3 u 4 0 if b 0 d 1 and g 0 d 4 23 on the other hands we can also see that there are two sets of steady state solutions the first set of constant solutions requires b 0 d 1 and g 0 d 4 z 1 0 0 0 0 z 2 k 1 b 0 d 1 b 0 0 0 0 z 3 0 0 0 k 2 g 0 d 4 g 0 there exists another set of constant solutions z 4 s i r b r d 3 i where s i and b are the solutions of the following nonlinear system b 0 k 1 s 2 b 0 d 1 s d 2 d 3 i 0 5 5 g 0 k 2 b 2 g 0 d 4 b i 0 5 6 s d 2 i 1 i 2 h 1 b 5 7 lemma 5 1 the nonlinear system 5 5 5 7 has at least one solution if and only if the following condition holds k 1 b 0 d 1 2 b 0 d 2 2 proof we first derive a necessary condition which will ensure the existence of a nontrivial constant solution by solving the quadratic equation 5 5 for s we obtain s 1 b 0 d 1 b 0 d 1 2 4 b 0 k 1 d 2 d 3 i 2 b 0 k 1 s 2 b 0 d 1 b 0 d 1 2 4 b 0 k 1 d 2 d 3 i 2 b 0 k 1 noting that d 2 d 3 0 we see that the range of i must satisfy 0 i i k 1 b 0 d 1 2 4 b 0 d 2 d 3 24 but we can see from eq 5 7 that s d 2 i 1 i 2 h 1 b d 2 1 1 2 h 1 b 1 i 2 h 1 b if we consider s as a function of i i e s s i we get s 0 0 s i 0 s d 2 1 on the other hand if we consider s 1 as a function of i i e s 1 s 1 i then we have s 1 0 k 1 b 0 d 1 b 0 s 1 i 0 we readily see that min i 0 i s 1 i s 1 i k 1 b 0 d 1 2 b 0 max i 0 i s 1 i s 1 0 k 1 b 0 d 1 b 0 consequently s i and s 1 i have an intersection point if and only if k 1 b 0 d 1 2 b 0 d 2 2 moreover the intersection point is unique since both s i and s 1 i are monotone functions similarly we see for s 2 s 2 0 0 s 2 i 0 s 2 i 0 hence we have max i 0 i s 2 i k 1 b 0 d 1 2 b 0 the above indicates the existence of an intersection point between s i and s 2 i as long as k 1 b 0 d 1 2 b 0 d 2 2 once i and s are determined one can easily solve for b from eq 5 6 b k 2 g 0 d 4 g 0 d 4 2 4 g 0 k 2 i 2 g 0 q e d 25 proof of theorem 2 2 let a be the diagonal matrix with the diffusion coefficients ai we can calculate the jacobian matrix for the nonlinear reaction terms from system 2 1 2 4 b 1 z fi ui 4 4 for z 1 0 0 0 0 it is easy to see the 4 4 matrix b 1 z 1 b 0 d 1 0 2 k 1 b 0 d 1 b 0 k 2 0 2 k 1 b 0 d 1 b 0 d 2 0 2 k 1 b 0 d 1 k 2 b 0 0 d 3 0 0 0 g 0 d 4 let 0 1 2 be the eighenvalue of the laplacian operator subject to the homoge neous neumann boundary condition it is easy to calculate the eigenvalues of aj z 1 df z 1 ja 1 j b 0 d 1 ja 1 2 j d 2 ja 2 3 j d 3 ja 3 4 j g 0 d 4 ja 4 since 1 0 is the first eigenvalue and b 0 d 1 and g 0 d 4 it follows that z 1 0 0 0 0 is unstable unless b 0 d 1 g 0 d 4 since j 0 the eigenvalues indicate that the stability of z 1 is not affected by the diffusion processes this is clear since the birth rate is greater than the death rate the population must be positive for a long time for z 2 k 1 b 0 d 1 b 0 0 0 0 we can see the 4 4 matrix b 1 z 2 b 0 d 1 k 1 1 b 0 d 1 b 0 2 k 1 b 0 d 1 b 0 k 2 0 1 k 1 b 0 d 1 b 0 d 2 0 2 k 1 b 0 d 1 b 0 k 2 0 d 3 0 0 0 g 0 d 4 then we consider aj z 2 df z 2 ja and see its characteristic polynomial denoted by p is equal to p b 0 d 1 ja 1 d 3 ja 3 2 g 0 d 4 ja 4 m 0 d 2 ja 2 m 0 d 2 ja 2 g 0 d 4 ja 4 m 0 26 where m 0 2 k 1 b 0 d 1 b 0 we obtain the eigenvalues 1 b 0 d 1 ja 1 2 d 3 ja 3 3 m 1 m 21 4 m 2 2 4 m 1 m 21 4 m 2 2 where m 1 m 0 d 2 ja 2 g 0 d 4 ja 4 m 2 m 0 d 2 ja 2 g 0 d 4 ja 4 m 0 it follows that z 2 is locally stable if m 1 0 and m 2 0 and z 2 is unstable for either m 1 0 or m 2 0 or m 2 1 4 m 2 0 when m 2 0 on the other hand we know j as j and m 21 4 m 2 0 consequently we conclude that z 2 is an unstable steady state solution now we calculate aj z 3 aj z 3 df z 3 ja for z 3 0 0 0 k 2 g 0 d 4 g 0 we can see the 4 4 matrix b 1 z 3 b 0 d 1 0 0 2 g 0 d 4 2 g 0 d 4 d 2 0 0 0 d 3 0 0 0 g 0 d 4 we know the characteristic polynomial for the matrix aj z 3 df z 3 i 4 4 is equal to p aj z 3 g 0 d 4 ja 4 p 0 where p 0 b 0 d 1 ja 1 d 3 ja 3 d 2 ja 2 2 g 0 d 4 2 g 0 d 4 27 hence the first eigenvalue is equal to 1 g 0 d 1 ja 4 to see the rest of eigenvalues of p we use a lemma from yin chen wang 55 lemma 5 2 let p 0 q and h be constants and p 0 3 p 2 q h 0 then it holds that a if h 0 there exists a positive root b if 0 h pq all roots have negative real parts c if pq h there is a root with positive real part d if pq h the roots are 1 p 2 q 3 q let p 0 3 p 2 q h with its coefficients given by p d 2 ja 2 d 3 ja 3 b 0 d 1 ja 1 q d 2 ja 2 d 3 ja 3 b 0 d 1 ja 1 d 2 ja 2 d 3 ja 3 h d 1 ja 1 b 0 d 2 ja 2 d 3 ja 3 2 g 0 d 4 2 g 0 d 4 since 1 0 is one of the eigenvalues and d 1 b 0 0 g 0 d 4 0 we see h 0 from the expression of h so z 3 is unstable finally we study the stability of z 4 since u 4 always has positive solutions as long as u 2 is positive it does not affect the stability of other variables we only need to focus on the stability of u 1 u 2 u 3 furthermore since 1 0 is the first eigenvalue the rest of eigenvalues have the same sign with di which increases the stability of the solution therefore we only need to find the conditions for the stability when 1 0 it is easy to calculate the jacobian matrix b 1 l 0 1 s 0 1 i 0 2 h b 0 d 2 0 0 d 3 where l 0 d 1 b 0 2 b 0 s 0 k 1 1 i 0 2 h 1 b 0 28 the characteristic polynomial of b 1 is equal to p 3 p 0 2 q 0 h 0 0 where p 0 l 0 d 2 d 3 l 0 q 0 d 3 l 0 d 2 l 0 d 2 1 s 0 1 i 0 2 h 1 b 0 h 0 d 3 l 0 d 2 1 s 0 1 i 0 2 h 1 b 0 1 i 0 2 h 1 b 0 by lemma 5 2 we can see the stability or instability of the steady state solution precisely when parameters varies in particular when l 0 0 if 1 and 2 are sufficiently small we see the condition 0 h 0 p 0 q 0 holds consequently the steady state solution s 0 i 0 r 0 is stable this result confirms the result of theorem 2 2 about the stability analysis of the steady state solution q e d 6 conclusion in this paper we have studied a nonlinear mathematical model for an epidemic caused by cholera without life time immunity the diffusion coefficients are different for each species moreover these coefficients are allowed to be dependent upon the concentration as well as the space location and time the resulting model system is strongly coupled we established the global well posedness for the coupled reaction diffusion system under some very mild conditions on the given data moreover we have analyzed the linear stability for the steady state solutions and proved that there is a turing phenomenon when the diffusion coefficients are different this result indicates that there are some fundamental differences between the ode model and the corresponding pde model these results show that the mathematical model is well defined and can be used by other researchers to conduct the field study the theoretical results obtained in this paper lays a solid foundation for other scientists in related fields to further study more constructive qualitative properties of the solutions the study will provide scientists a deeper understanding of the dynamics of the interaction between bacteria and susceptible infected and recovered species we have used many ideas and techniques from the elliptic and parabolic equations particularly the energy method and sobolev s inequalities there are some open questions that remain to be answered and further studies are needed acknowledgements this
