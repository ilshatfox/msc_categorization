rogers department of physics and astronomy university of manitoba winnipeg manitoba canada r 3 t 2 n 2 august 22 2018 abstract when doubly affine matrices such as latin and magic squares with a single non zero eigenvalue 1 ev are powered up they become constant matrices after a few steps the process of compounding squares of orders m and n can then be used to generate an infinite series of 1 ev squares of orders mn the cayley hamilton theorem is used to understand this 1 ev prop erty where their characteristic polynomials xn lnx n 1 have just two terms with n the order of the square and ln the row column sum 1 introduction we consider a diagonal latin square dls a sud 4 a from cameron rogers and loly 6 dmps of four symbols here 1 2 3 4 in arithmetic progression which has just one non zero eigenvalue 1 ev and then its matrix square a 2 and cube a 3 1 2 3 4 3 4 1 2 4 3 2 1 2 1 4 3 27 23 27 23 23 27 23 27 23 27 23 27 27 23 27 23 250 250 250 250 250 250 250 250 250 250 250 250 250 250 250 250 1 the intermediate square of two symbols still has rows r columns c and diagonals main d 1 dexter d 2 rcd with a common linesum 100 but the final stage is a constant matrix with identical elements with all higher powers then constant matrices we described sud 4 a as a mini sudoku in dmps because of its design as a miniature version of order 2 latin squares as subsquares in a 4 4 frame contrasted with the well known sudoku solutions of a 9 9 puzzle of a larger latin square of 9 symbols 1 2 9 with one of each in every 3 by 3 subsquare this result in 1 characterizes the present study and the sequence is quite dramatic when each unique element is designated by a colour declining from four colours through two to a uniform single colour 1 http arxiv org abs 1712 03393 v 1 this study was prompted by a note to an online group of magic square bloggers c 27 september 2016 by miguel amela ama in powers of associa tive magic squares 2 which renewed interest w r t powering up matrixwise associative magic squares also called regular or symmetric in much of the ear lier literature see loly cameron trump and schindel 15 laa which also includes references to earlier literature this is quite different from the issue of multimagic squares which remain dda when all their elements are squared cubed etc see boyer 5 and derksen eggermont and van den essen 9 in particular miguel amela was concerned to show counterexamples to propo sition 6 1 by cook bacon and hillman 8 cbh let m be any associative p p magic square with magic constant m then m 2 n 1 is magic with magic constant m 2 n 1 and m 2 n is semimagic we will show counterexamples in part because we find examples that become constant matrices at orders n 4 5 8 16 cbh stated that the proof of their proposition involves matrix algebra and an analysis of the eigenvalues but details were not given an alternation for odd versus even powers of associative magic squares was also claimed we will illuminate this claim with a variety of examples while extending beyond the specific constraints of associative magic squares i e those magic squares with antipodal pair sums of 1 n 2 or latins with pair sums 1 n while cbh were concerned with the magicness of the powered up squares the present work evolves from amela s later observation 30 september 2016 linking some counterexamples to certain order 4 associative magic squares hav ing the property of just one non zero eigenvalue 1 ev again see our laa the corresponding characteristic polynomials are obtained by evaluating det a xin 0 where in is the n by n identity matrix for the first three powers p 1 2 3 of sud 4 a the characteristic polynomials charpoly are given in turn with their corresponding eigenvalues i singular values svs i and matrix rank r equal to the number of non zero svs and sum of the 4 th powers of the second to last svs r p charpoly i i r r 1 x 4 10 x 3 10 0 0 0 10 4 2 0 3 272 2 x 4 100 x 3 100 0 0 0 100 8 0 0 2 4096 3 x 4 1000 x 3 1000 0

powers of all but the lead sv in dmps we introduced singular value clans which are characterised by a particular set of singular values as a powerful way to classify different magic and latin squares of the same order and the r index r n i 2 4 i 2 2 which is an integer for all integer squares see dmps the rest of this paper continues with some preliminary matrix spectral issues before completing the order 4 latin square issues then moving on to the parallel situation for magic squares and after that the results of compounding squares of orders m and n as an extension of chan and loly 7 in order to generate an infinite series of 1 ev squares of orders mn which the present authors know 22 rcl will also have just 1 ev the present approach builds on our previous 2004 7 studies of magic square spectra in 15 laa which revealed several cases with 1 ev and included a discussion of non diagonable matrices as well as the insight gained by looking at jordan normal forms together with our more recent 2013 extension which also included latin squares in dmps for sud 4 a these all have mattingly s 16 multiplicity of zero eigenvalues here 3 originally for magic squares the number of svs and thus the matrix rank decrease from 3 through 2 to 1 in this powering we will later use the cayley hamilton theorem 13 which states that the characteristic polynomial is also satisfied by the matrix itself to understand this 1 ev property these 1 ev squares provide hitherto unexpected examples which become constant on matrix powering integer latin and magic squares each have characteristic row and column sums which are therefore doubly affine da in addition magic squares have the same sums for both major diagonals all of our early da squares can be scaled up by constructing larger compound or composite da squares of multiplicative order following an ancient strategy extended by chan and loly cl circa 2008 we realized that this preserved the 1 ev property details and more varieties not needed here are included in a companion paper rcl 2 terminology for magic and latin squares our interest in 1 ev matrices began c 2004 with magic squares as reported in a conference in 2007 14 iwms and published in 2009 laa but we did not envisage this powering issue even though we were aware of prior interest in powering up magic squares as indicated in section 3 5 of that work however in september 2016 miguel amela 2 ama rekindled this by drawing our attention to squaring 8 associative or symmetric or regular 3 order 4 magic squares which we had previously identified as having 1 ev 14 15 we are particularly concerned to be more precise with the use of both magic and semimagic terms by grounding them in a long tradition that stretches more than a century e g andrews classic work 3 itself largely a compilation of works by several authors who published in the monist we find it worth clarifying magic terminology since cbh appear to have followed stark 24 who used magic when just the row and column sums are equal usually called semimagic thus ignoring the two main diagonals usually included in the definition of traditional magic squares since having the same diagonal sums is a feature of the great majority of studies on magic squares 12 we include the diagonals in our definition and thus use the familiar term 3 of semi magic squares for those lacking one or both diagonals here magic is reserved for classic magic squares of sequential integers with the same rcd sums 3 and semimagic whenever one or both diagonals do not have the same linesum so we leave magic and semimagic for those which have non sequential elements we note that semimagic and latin squares are also doubly affine da while magic squares are diagonal doubly affine dda we use magic squares with elements from the consecutive set 1 2 3 n 2 and our latin squares have n symbols in each row and column whose elements run from 1 2 n which are also the most common historically then their linesums a k a magic constants ln in the abstract for magic and latin squares are respectively sn n 2 1 n 2 sn n 2 1 n 3 e g s 3 15 s 4 34 and s 2 3 s 3 6 s 4 10 replacing the generic ln used in the abstract we note that the elements used here are in arithmetic progression but that there is some interest in magic squares which are not e g fibonacci magic squares in cbh which we examine near the end all magic squares have 8 phases on rotation and reflection and we have previously noted in laa some variations in spectral properties as a result that turn out to be relevant here amongst the varieties of magic squares several types have further properties due to additional constraints e g associated or associative or regular where all antipodal pairs have the same sum pandiagonal where all parallel broken diagonals also have the magic linesum ultramagic which are both associative and pandiagonal etc see laa further there are other squares of interest particularly with ben franklin s bent diagonal squares which at least are semimagic due to their half row and column sum property see schindel rempel and loly 23 prsa our tests include orders 3 4 5 8 and 16 for magic squares but began with the latin square sud 4 a which affords by far the simplest example also we do not restrict ourselves to associative magic squares knowing already that other types in laa exhibit 1 evs also our order four 1 ev examples multiply up to order 16 by the basic compounding process described in 2002 by chan and loly 7 cl which preserves the 1 ev property for the 880 order 4 magic squares we use the indexing common to the book by benson and jacoby 4 as well as the web pages of harvey heinz 12 note also that cbh use regular for sequential elements we prefer to reserve regular as an alternate to associative as per andrews 1917 2004 3 3 doubly affine considerations it is helpful now to rephrase cbh s proposition 1 1 if a and b are n n semimagic matrices with magic constants m and n respectively then ab and ba are semimagic with magic constant mn a proof was given by cbh which remains valid if we edit it to apply to doubly affine square matrices as a new proposition 4 proposition 1 if a and b are n n da matrices with magic constants m and n respectively then ab and ba are da with magic constant mn 3 1 multiplying by constant square matrices cbh also noted that if a is magic and if some power of a is constant then since a constant matrix times a magic square is constant it follows that all higher powers are magic our proposition 1 now takes care of multiplying by a constant square matrix such a constant matrix can be represented by cen where c is a multiplicative factor and en is an n n unit matrix consisting of all 1 s in tables below we will characterize the nature of the da integer squares by their type i e magic or diagonal da dda and semimagic or simply da also the elements do not need to be integers for either the latin or magic squares although that is usually the case both latin squares and magic squares are characterised by constant row and column linesums and even without the same linesum s for both diagonals are both da hence its use in the title all magic squares are characterised by having the same linesum on all rows colums and both diagonals 4 characteristic polynomials and the cayley hamilton theorem in table 1 we saw that sud 4 a has rank 3 with characteristic polynomial x 4 10 x 3 0 or x 4 10 x 3 4 we will build more evidence later for the role of a single non zero eigenvalue 1 ev but for now turn to looking at the characteristic polynomials for an understanding of the powering of 1 ev magical squares to constancy see 15 for sud 4 a in 1 has solutions x 10 the linesum eigenvalue and the triply degenerate x 0 so according to the cayley hamilton theorem 13 one can substitute the matrix a for for x in the characteristic equation if 0 is the null matrix and i is the identity matrix of the same order here n 4 with s 1 1 a 4 10 a 3 0 or a 4 10 a 3 5 which means that both a 3 and a 4 are constant matrices and then multi plying both sides successively by a for a 5 10 a 4 and so on for constancy at all higher powers we see that all powers higher than p 2 are constant matrices with just one non zero eigenvalue 3 we conclude more generally that cayley hamilton applied to 1 ev charac teristic polynomials amounts to proposition 2 doubly affine squares with 1 ev power up a to constant matrices 5 which we will illustrate by examples where constancy occurs at either the cube or quartic power 4 1 singular values svs and gramian matrix product the source of the matrix singular values svs the gramian matrix product used to obtain the squares of the svs from the product of a matrix and its transpose either aat or ata is quite similar to the squared product of a matrix with itself with the same row and column sums and for sud 4 a is 30 22 20 28 22 30 28 20 20 28 30 22 28 20 22 30 6 while differing in the information that it yields those svs lead us to the entropic measures introduced by newton and de salvo 17 nds in 2010 for their sudoku study which we extended to a wider set of latin squares as well as magic squares in dmps and used here for comparing successive powers 5 measures of the diversity of matrix elements our results will be presented in terms of the compression entropic measure c introduced for sudoku solutions following nds which offers an insight into the increase in uniformity upon powering up through squaring cubing etc through a measure based on the singular values of matrices specifically one takes the shannon entropy h which is a function of the singular values nor malized by their sum i and then used to obtain the percentage compression c in nds h i i ln i c 1 h ln n 100 7 an alternative spread measure of the elements divides the difference be tween max and min elements of matrices by their average value spread n max fi min fi l n 8 where l n is the row column linesum eigenvalue for sud 4 a p r c spread type 1 3 35 0603 1 2 diagonal latin dls r 272 2 2 80 9527 0 16 dda associative 3 1 100 0 constant 250 e 4 table 2 sud 4 a p is the matrix power r the matrix rank c the compression here to 4 decimal places the spectra listed in table 1 are not repeated here 6 in our tables c 100 means that every element of the cubed and higher powers of sud 4 a has all elements the same increasing powers have decreasing spread although we prefer the increasing nds compression measure 6 a note on jordan normal form the 1 ev squares that produce the constant matrix are non diagonalizable see laa as revealed by the algebraic and geometric multiplicities of the eigen values in these situations a decomposition of the non diagonalizable matrix a is still possible via the jordan normal form a pjp 1 where p is an invertible matrix and j is the jordan matrix 13 20 we note that this form allows powers of the matrix to be computed easily an pjnp 1 since we have pp 1 i the identity matrix the jordan form of the square is useful since it is composed of q blocks each of rank ri i 1 q whose sum corresponds to the rank of the square and the maximum blocksize k indicates the exponent required to reduce our magic square to a constant matrix the jordan normal form often called the jordan canonical form is an upper triangular matrix which has each non zero off diagonal entry equal to 1 immediately above the main diagonal on the superdiagonal and with identical diagonal entries to the left and below them to form blocks e g the 3 by 3 2 by 2 and 1 by 1 blocks 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 2 1 0 2 0 q 1 q 9 for a diagonalizable matrix the jordan form simply has eigenvalues along the main diagonal with 1 s above the diagonals in each block of dimension greater than one and where all non displayed entries are zero 19 7 nilpotent square matrices with 1 ev a nilpotent matrix is a square matrix n such that nq 0 for some positive integer q where its smallest value is sometimes called the degree or index of n let z be a latin or magic square of order n with magic constant linesum l and n 1 zero eigenvalues then we can write z in terms of n a nilpotent 7 matrix of order n and index k n with zero line sum and the square matrix of order n of all ones en in the following fashion z n l n en or n z l n en 10 the square n will be nilpotent since it will have all zero eigenvalues as required if we raise z to the kth power we will end up with a polynomial in n and en composed of terms nk l n kekn and cross terms in l n pnk pepn with appro priate binomial coefficients the first term nk vanishes since we have index k the crossterms will all vanish because they involve multiplying n by en which simply gives zero elements becauhe effect of en is to sum the rows columns of n that has zero linesum since ekn n k 1 n en we end up for our magic square that zk l k n en a constant matrix also for a nilpotent matrix n of index k the jordan form jk has just 1 s above the main diagonal from which it follows that to reduce the jordan form to a zero matrix we need to raise it successively to the kth power while watching the one s migrate out of the resulting products for the 1 ev order 4 da squares of interest here the jordan form is j 4 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 with l the linesum eigenvalue 11 the largest blocksize is 3 which has rank 2 so the rank of this 4 square is r 4 2 1 3 if l 4 is the da linesum the diagonal elements for j 3 4 are 0 0 0 l 34 and all superdiagonal elements are zero this form is characteristic of all n 4 1 ev magic squares and a j 5 example for n 5 will be shown later 8 jordan forms for powers of sud 4 a 3 for sud 4 a and its powers in the introduction the second power has all element pairs symmetric about the centre with the same sum there 50 and can be classified as associative or regular using terminology from the literature of magic squares 15 with higher powers trivially so however the initial sud 4 a is clearly not associative we now show their jordan forms 20 13 in terms of blocks along the main diagonal 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 10 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 100 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1000 12 here the off diagonal 1 s move out for each rise in power with their matrix ranks first from an order 3 block of rank 2 and the diagonal 10 for rank 8 r 2 1 3 next an order 2 block and the diagonal 100 for rank r 1 1 2 and then final rank r 0 1 1 after which the higher powers are all constant matrices 9 lat 4 a 3 non zero eigenvalues 3 ev 1 there are many singular squares of order 4 and higher with three non zero eigenvalues the abbreviation 3 ev will be useful here we compare sud 4 a with lat 4 a from which we obtained the former by moving the second row to the last now the first three powers of lat 4 a are lat 4 a 1 2 3 4 2 1 4 3 3 4 1 2 4 3 2 1 30 28 22 20 28 30 20 22 22 20 30 28 20 22 28 30 232 236 264 268 236 232 268 264 264 268 232 236 268 264 236 232 13 none of these are associative but all are antipodal about the center or symmetric about both main diagonals and all still four symbol latin the spectra of lat 4 a and its first four powers are p 1 i 10 4 2 0 i 10 4 2 0 p 2 i i 100 16 4 0 p 3 i 10 3 64 8 0 i 103 64 8 0 p 4 i i 10 4 256 16 0 all with multiplicity 1 of zero eigenvalues then other measures are p r c spread type r 1 3 35 0603 1 2 latin d 1 4 d 2 16 272 2 3 61 4828 0 4 da d 1 120 d 2 80 65 792

uniformity while the spread decreases gradually towards uniformity but neither is ever achieved here the average of the diagonal sums is the common rc linesum in table 1 the jordan normal form was already useful to us for non diagonalizable sud 4 a as shown in 15 for magic squares so the diagonal form for lat 4 a which is diagonalizable has eigenvalues 4 2 0 10 down the main diagonal r 3 a discussion of eigenvalue and singular value spectra for low order latin and magic squares that is useful in the present context is found in 6 9 10 the n 3 associative magic square 0 aside from rotations and reflections there is just one third order magic square the ancient loshu here a loshu 4 9 2 3 5 7 8 1 6 which is the top bottom reflection of a 1 of cbh we show it followed by its square cube and quartic matrix powers p 1 2 3 4 9 2 3 5 7 8 1 6 59 83 83 83 59 83 83 83 59 1149 1029 1197 1173 1125 1027 1053 1221 1101 14 here the non singular characteristic polynomials are respectively p

elements increase rapidly notice how the relative spread of the elements progressively decreases on powering up these are tabled up to sixth matrix power in the following table p r c spread type 1 3

linesum at each power is s 3 15 p i e 15 225 3375 50625 in table 4 the odd and even powers are in agreement with the alternation in cbh s propositions 2 1 for 3 by 3 s and their general proposition 6 1 as their magic alternates with semimagic as powers increase and the compression monotonically tends to 100 while the spread tends progressively to zero in laa we showed the jordan form of the loshu which has just the eigen values on the main diagonal and also discussed the 8 phases of magic squares using the loshu as an example of changing eigenvalues from 15 2 i 6 2 i 6 to 15 2 6 2 6 on rotation by 90 degrees in the first table on page 2667 of laa 11 prior applications and studies of matrix pow ering the previous 3 ev cases of lat 4 a and loshu both illustrate the gradual increase in compression and reduction in spread which are more representative of larger 10 general not doubly affine matrices where the iterative powering up of ma trices towards constancy has proved useful e g for the largest eigenvalue of large matrices pitman 21 reference to von mises etc with addition of the corresponding eigenvector evolutions the compression and spread measures in tables 2 and 3 are an indicator of what happens in the cases of larger matrices of full rank but singular magic and latin squares may coverge much more rapidly as shown by some examples shown below first we use our earlier results for the spectral properties of the well known complete set of 880 fourth order magic squares where we elucidated the 1 ev phenomenon laa and where we noted earlier powering literature before a brief discussion of 1 ev fifth order magic squares from the complete set of some 275 million higher orders are impossible to survey in their entirety but prompted by cbh we take a look at order 8 in the context of franklin squares prsa 12 n 4 magic squares dudeney groups and sv clans from dudeney 1917 10 we have an important classification of frenicle s 1699 count into the dudeney group classification listing of the 880 distinct order 4 magic squares we refer to the appendix of benson and jacoby 4 for a list of the 880 with their dudeney group designation in 2007 9 laa noted n that reference s table 3 that the 7 dudeney groups i ii iii iv v vi p vi s were singular with at least one zero eigenvalue then in dmps we gave a summary of order n 4 magic squares which have 880 distinct members in 13 dudeney groups and the then new 63 sv clans which we introduced further dudeney groups i pandiagonal ii semi pandiagonal semi bent and iii associative regular semi pandiagonal each have

only took this to the second power and did not note the constancy which begins at power p 3 f 360 is also a column permutation of 11 matlab s magic 4 which is 29 in laa p 2668 col 1 col 3 col 2 col 1

totally different because of the constancy and since for p 2 we find our dda instead of their semimagic note how the rank descends from 3 through 2 to rank 1 i e a matrix of equal elements and remains there for higher powers n b cbh late in their paper in proof of their proposition 5 1 for an unusual order 8 magic square also indicate this point but did not link it to the 1 ev property more on this later 12 2 f 299 clan beta associative 3 1 ev consider also a second 1 ev from group iii but now in sv clan beta f 299 2 7 13 12 16 9 3 6 11 14 8 1 5 4 10 15 now the only differences from table 6 are

the forty 3 ev associative regular semi pandiagonal group iii in laa s 31 which affords an example on a par with cbh table 5 in laa shows that it is a member of sv clan alpha in table 5 a f 175 is shown next followed by its matrix square and cube 1 12 8 13 14 7 11 2 15 6 10 3 4 9 5 16 341 261 285 269 285 301 309 261 261 309 301 285 269 285 261 341 16 for f 175 i 34 8 8 0 2 i 1156 320 20 0 showing the singularity while the results are otherwise qualitatively similar to those in table 4 for n 3 with c rising from 37 2284 at p 1 to 99 7369 at p 6 and spread declining from 1 7647 to 0 0009 with the jordan form for f 175 just has the eigenvalues on the diagonal while it is not our goal to give a complete account of all n 4 magic squares it does seem worthwhile to note other 1 ev cases which are not associative magic squares and thus become constant under powering these are found in dudeney s 10 group i pandiagonals and his group ii semi pandiagonal and semi bent see table 3 in laa of which we choose one of the latter next 12 4 f 27 group ii semi pandiagonal semi bent rank os cillator 1 3 not associative a question that must be addressed is whether associativity in magic squares such as f 360 is necessary for the powering pattern given by cbh of alternation of magic and semimagic in dudeney s group ii semi pandiagonal semi bent magic squares laa there are 32 magic squares with multiplicity of zero eigenvalues 1 and 16 oscillating on reflection or rotation laa table 3 between 1 and 3 e g from the list in benson and jacoby 4 we take first f 27 with 1 with eigenvalues i 34 8 8 0 which is similar to f 175 in behaviour under powering with f 27 having a diagonal jordan form the same as for f 175 above so not shown explicity here the powering details omitted follow cbh s proposition 6 1 thus extending its scope beyond just the associative magic squares in group ii 12 4 1 f 27 rotated pi 2 now with a different result compared to f 27 but with the pattern of constancy by power p 3 as in table 6 for f 360 and with the exception only of a slightly different type for p 2 of da with d 2 1092 instead of dda so dudeney 10 group ii semi bent semi pandiagonals have the same behaviour for the rotated phase as did the group iii associatives for all their phases thus 1 ev magic squares do not need to be associative 13 we note also that group i pandiagonals have another 16 phase oscillators see table 3 in laa for sixteen more 1 ev magic squares 12 5 non singular group ix f 181 0 not associative for the sake of comparison with previous singular case we choose a f 181

360 this associative magic square differs from cbh s proposition 6 1 now the powers of the jordan forms see the off diagonal 1 s moving out until constancy is reached in a similar fashion to 12 i e a single 4 by 4 block of rank 3 for the zero eigenvalues whose rank reduces by 1 for each increase in power with powers of 65 left on the lower right corner this shows why constancy is attained at p 4 rather than the previous p 3 examples 13 1 n 5 0 ultramagic non singular magic square in laa we examined laa 45 an ultramagic square associative and pandiagonal here the results are otherwise qualitatively similar to those in table 4 for n 3 with c rising p as 23 4758 to 99 4352 at p 5 and spread declining from 1 84615 to 0 003 this agrees with cbh s 2010 proposition 6 1 which predicts alternation between their magic our dda and their semimagic our da we also note that there are no singular n 5 latin squares dmps and so no 1 evs dmps 14 are there 1 ev squares in order 6 and higher from dmps there are singular rank 4 order 6 latin squares but we are not aware of any 1 ev examples moreover there are no n 6 associative magic squares see trump 25 for n 6 and higher there are too many magic squares to count 25 but some of these are discussed in our laa so special cases must be considered one of which we address next 14 1 n 8 franklin bent diagonal squares rank 3 5 here we consider questions concerning the complete set of n 8 franklin squares which were first counted by schindel rempel and loly srl in 23 prsa these are characterised by common half row and column sums and thus are at least semimagic as well as a complete set of 4 n bent diagonals prsa franklin s handful of squares also had another property that all 2 by 2 quartets have the half row column sum and which is considered a further constraint srl were also the first to find magic franklin squares since exactly 1 3 of their definitive count were also da in their rows and columns moreover in dmps we stated on p 2675 that all 368 640 eighth order natural pandiagonal franklin squares have three non zero eigenvalues and that they are singular with rank 3 our landmark count of the order 8 franklin bent diagonal semimagic squares did not consider their spectral properties prsa but in dmps we reported that they are rank 3 and thus highly singular cbh drew attention to a particular magic square bf which they de rived from a bona fide franklin square of neal abrahams on suzanne ale 15 jandre s web site 1 by rc permutations of rows 1 2 and then rows 3 4 for abrahams square not shown here i 260 43

1 228 d 2 292 14 1 1 cbh s franklin 8 th order 1 ev magic squares 7 cbh claimed to study ben franklin s 8 x 8 magic square matrix bf added to the puzzle in retrospect is proposition 5 1 of cbh the ale jandre form of the ben franklin 8 by 8 magic square and all of its kth integral powers are magic with magic constant 260 k their proof noted that for k 2 the powered up matrix was a constant matrix all elements equal but this was understated and they did not appear to extend this to other magic squares and then we found that their s was not a bona fide franklin bent diagonal square unfortunately this is not a true franklin square see prsa because while magic in rcd it is not so in all the bent diagonals cbh use a row permutation of abrahams bona fide franklin square which is not magic in the diagonals 1 involving swapping row 1 and 2 and then row 3 and 4 while a bona fide magic square rcd in their proof of their proposition 5 1 cbh state that powers of this magic square for the cube and higher are constant magic matrices with magic constant 260 k 1 k 2 after correcting the last cell in cbh in the first row from a duplicate 10 to 19 bf 14 3 62 51 46 35 30 19 52 61 4 13 20 29 36 45 11

eigenvalue in contrast with three in the rank 3 franklin n 8 set 6 23 it has characteristic polynomial and spectra 260 x 7 x 8 i 260 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 with the same svs as above for abra hams square where we note as an aside that 2 i are not always integer and again with r 463 223 040 which is identical with abrahams square above i e both are in the same sv clan dmps this all suggests to us that many more 1 ev squares may be expected by applying similar row and or column permutations to other bona fide franklin squares the jordan form of this remarkable magic square is simply an enlarge ment to n 8 of the n 4 jordan forms in 11 for sud 4 a j 4 etc by the addi tion of 4 more rows and columns of zeroes with the magic eigenvalue as appro priate now 260 and so need not take up display space moreover the powering 16 is similar to table 6 with c 61 4849 97 872 0 spread 1 9385 0 0152 0 0 with linesums s 8 p 260 p i e 260 67600 p r c spread type 1 3 61 4849 1 93846 magic r 463 223 040 2 2 97

found the single eigen value property nordgren 18 recently showed that odd matrix powers of true pandiagonal franklin squares prsa are also pandiagonal franklin squares and confirmed the rank 3 property 15 compounding sud 4 a to order 16 1 ev dls compounding is an ancient idea more than a thousand years for generating larger magic squares initially used for multiplying up the non singular n 3 loshu to order 9 a paper with wayne chan 7 cl on rediscovering the basic compound idea used here included iterating a pandiagonal and most perfect n 4 with euler s 1779 pandiagonal n 7 to the highly compounded n 12 544 4472 also pandiagonal now the 1 ev property extends to compounded 1 ev latin and magic squares next we apply compounding to our 1 ev latin square sud 4 a before consider ing the magic square parallels 22 rcl the order of the squares increases to multiples of n 4 i e n 16 64 256 of which the first will be considered in detail here in 2004 we began work on an expansion of the compounding idea to in clude latin squares and general magic squares which lead to a formula for the eigenvalues and singular values of compounded magic and latin squares which was included in our talk at iwms 16 in 2007 at windsor ontario see the conference powerpoint slides see iwms it became clear to us by 2008 that compounding 1 evs would produce larger 1 evs due to space restrictions the compound work was not included in the laa conference proceedings with the idea that it would be featured in a follow up paper 22 rcl which now follows the present work so in the present context it is obvious that the compounded 1 ev n 4 latin and magic squares compound to n 16 1 ev squares with 15 and rank 5 and thus worth raising to higher powers the idea is to place incremented versions of the basic square in positions in a larger square with the same underlying pattern which in this case is a latin square of 16 symbols which takes a lot of space which we abbreviate by suggesting an order four filled with a sud 4 a b sud 4 a 4 e 4 c sud 4 a 8 e 4 d sud 4 a 12 e 4 17 a b c d c d a b d c b a b a d c 18 or explicitly with blank rows and columns 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 3 4 1

the compound spectral formulae of rcl this is diagonal latin dl with rank 5 the results on powering up are similar to sud 4 a in table 2 thus agreeing with our proposition 2 but now with c 55 8491 and spread 1 76471 at p 1 both sud 4 a and its compound are dls now the linesums in each row are s 16 p 136 p i e for p 1 2 3 these are 136 18496 2515456 their characteristic polynomials are respectively x 16 136 x 15 x 16 18496 x 15 x 16 2 515 456 x 15 etc the first of these says that the eigenvalues are 136 and fifteen zeroes i e another 1 ev square with multiplicity 15 and so on now we find an n 16 jordan form of which we show just an 8 by 8 portion of the order 16 as the rest contains the only zero elements 18 j 16 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 136 20 where two 3 by 3 rank 2 jordan blocks along the diagonal are followed after nine rows and columns of zeros before the corner diagonal element of the linesum 136 so we have a degree 2 2 1 3 compound square i e raising it to the cube power will provide us with a constant matrix of the previous form zk l k n en with the observed rank decreasing by 2 each time because we have two jordan blocks each contributing now a rank 1 decrease at each power this jordan structure explains why constancy is attained at p 3 as for sud 4 a itself and not much higher as might have been expected by cayley hamilton which gives a 16 136 a 15 continuing this compounding also gives larger latin squares or orders 4 16 64 4 64 256 all 1 ev 16 n 16 compounding of associative 1 ev f 360 now we follow the previous compounding of sud 4 a with the analogous ap proach for an n 4 1 ev magic square above an example for a different order four magic square is shown explicitly in cl the jordan form here dif fers from the compound of sud 4 a only by the magic linesum which here is l 16 s 16 sum 1 256 16 2056 for the 1 ev compounding of f 360 the powers show constancy again at p 3 as for the previous sud 4 a compounding and the same reduction in rank as for the compounding of sud 4 a now with c increasing from 64 3023 and spread decreasing from 1 98444 at p 1 compare with table 6 16 1 larger compound magic squares for 1 ev compound magic squares combinations of the basic 1 ev magic squares n 4 5 8 featured in this work this means that compounding will produce orders 4 5 20 8 5 40 16 5 90 etc in addition to all those that we could make just from powers of n 4 5 8 for n 1 4 n 2 5 the 1 ev order 20 compound magic squares have rank 6 as expected rcl and power up to constancy at p 4 the same as for the n 5 1 ev component as discussed earlier this may be continued for magic squares to multiples of n 5 and then products of powers of 4 and 5 i e 4 5 20 16 5 80 4 25 100 19 17 products of different n 4 1 ev magic squares squaring a matrix is a pair product and cubing a triple product for the associative group iii s we now try mixing different members of the same clan 17 1 double and triple products of different alpha squares see table 5 for details of the alpha and beta clans consider the following pair of alpha squares as a matrix product pair 1 f 360 f 790 i 1156 80 80 0 d 1 1316 d 2 1156 which is no longer 1 ev but now 3 ev and da which indicates that even with the same clan the 1 ev property is destroyed in this pair we have tested powers of pair 1 to 4 th order and it is always 3 ev but slowly approaching constancy however including either component f 360 or f 790 as a third matrix before or after pair 1 always renews the 1 ev property f 360 pair 1 f 360 f 360 f 790 1 ev constant also at p 2 3 pair 1 f 360 f 360 f 790 f 360 1 ev constant also at p 3 4 pair 1 f 790 f 360 f 790 f 790 1 ev constant also at p 2 3 f 790 pair 1 f 790 f 360 f 790 1 ev constant also at p 3 4 these show that when the same square is adjacent the constancy appears in the first squared power of the triple product whereas when they are separated by the other the constancy is delayed to the cube 17 2 pair products of alpha and beta squares multiplying a mixed pair of 1 ev svs an alpha square with a beta square also produces a 3 ev m 1 square e g try 1 ev beta f 489 with alpha f 790 pair 2 f 489 f 790 i 1156 32 16 0 d 1 1140 d 2 1204 so no longer 1 ev but now 3 ev da which again suggests that mixing clans destroys the 1 ev property again we have tested powers of pair 2 to 4 th order and it is always 3 ev but slowly approaching constancy however the following triples are now all 1 ev with the same pattern as for the previous cases which used a single clan f 489 pair 2 f 489 f 489 f 790 1 ev constant also at p 2 3 pair 2 f 489 f 489 f 790 f 489 1 ev constant also at p 3 4 pair 2 f 790 f 489 f 790 f 790 1 ev constant also at p 2 3 f 790 pair 2 f 790 f 489 f 790 1 ev constant also at p 3 4 17 3 commutation non commuting matrix operators encountered in the matrix formulation of quantum mechanics prompt us to consider this issue for the pair products above first with the same clan pair pair 1 f 360 f 790 comm 1 f 360 f 790 f 790 f 360 i 80 80 0 0 d 1 0 d 2 0 so the 3 ev pair 1 has a 2 ev commutator 20 second with the mixed clan pair pair 2 bj 489 f 790 comm 2 bj 489 f 790 f 790 bj 489 i 48 32 16 0 d 1 0 d 2 96 and the 3 ev pair 2 has a 3 ev commutator with this insight we discontinue further exploration of these products 18 fibonacci magic square 0 we include this since cbh introduced herta freitag s order four

circles touch 20 conclusions it was necessary to review previous magic terminology for these powers lead ing to our use of doubly affine and diagonal doubly affine to characterize these magical squares using doubly affine in our proposition 1 to include both latin and magic squares we showed that certain associative n 4 5 1 ev squares power up to constancy in a few steps this was understood by using the cayley hamilton theorem for the corresponding characteristic equations leading to our propo sition 2 cbh s proposition 6 1 had claimed that for any associative magic squares their odd powers remained magic while their even powers were just semimagic but we found exceptions in addition we found evidence that another type did satisfy their proposition a different variation of cbh s alternation between magic and semimagic found in some of our examples we found constancy for latin sud 4 a at p 3 as well as for its compounding to n 16 and for some n 4 examples while constancy occured at p 4 for an n 5 associative 1 ev magic square as well as for their compounding to multiplicative orders it was necessary to study their jordan forms in order to understand constancy at p 3
