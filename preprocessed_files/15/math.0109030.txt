several open problems on gkk matrices raised by examples showing that some such matrices are unstable 1 motivation a complex square matrix is called positive stable if all its eigenvalues have positive real part such stability of a matrix or more usually of its negative is a basic concern in several fields of mathematics e g in the study of odes three important classes of matrices namely the nonsingular totally nonnegative matrices the hermitian pos itive definite matrices and the m matrices are known to be stable matrices in these three classes also share other properties they are p matrices they are weakly sign symmetric and they satisfy eigenvalue monotonicity for definitions of these terms see below in order to investigate the relations between these properties supersets of the three basic matrix classes defined in terms of some or all of the above properties have been studied thus gantmacher krein 7 kotelyansky 10 fan 6 and carlson 2 3 investigated properties of p matrices that are weakly sign symmetric the so called gkk matrices while engel schneider 5 considered matrices which are defined as p matrices that satisfy eigenvalue monotonicity the latter were further investigated by varga 14 hershkowitz berman 9 and mehrmann 12 the stability of gkk and matrices was conjectured and proved in low dimensions in various papers see holtz 11 for details and further history and see also the survey by hershkowitz 8 the gkk matrices satisfy the three properties discussed above nevertheless holtz 11 has shown that there are unstable gkk matrices this raises the question under what conditions a gkk matrix is stable it is the purpose of this note to outline five problems related to this question 1 http arxiv org abs math 0109030 v 1 2 basic notions let n denote the collection of all increasing sequences with elements from the set 1 2 n and let denote the size of the sequence given a matrix a cn n we will use the notation a for the submatrix of a whose rows are indexed by and columns by n and a for the minor deta if for simplicity a will stand for a and a for a by definition a 1 given n with call the number the dispersal of the minor a a matrix a is called a p matrix if a 0 for all n a is said to be sign symmetric if a a 0 1 for all minors a a is called weakly sign symmetric 7 if 1 holds for all minors a with dispersal 1 and these are also referred to as almost principal weakly sign symmetric p matrices were calledgkk in 6 after gantmacher krein and kotelyan sky a p matrix is strict gkk if the inequalities in 1 are strict for all almost principal minors let a denote the spectrum of a and let l a min a ir with the understanding that in this setting min a matrix a is called an matrix 5 if it has eigenvalue monotonicity in the sense that l a l a whenever 6 n a is a matrix if in addition l a 0 a matrix is called positive stable if its spectrum lies entirely in the open right half plane in the sequel we will shorten the term positive stable to simply stable 3 gkk matrix stability and related problems 1 strict gkk matrices closure of the set what gkk matrices can be approximated arbitrarily well by strict gkk matrices in particular can the matrices constructed in 11 be approximated by matrices that are strict gkk the matrices in 11 themselves are not strict gkk the negative answer to this question would give rise to problem 1 a 1 a strict gkk matrices stability are strict gkk matrices stable are strict gkk matrices stable 2 dispersal condition sufficient for stability the counterexample given in 11 shows that it is not sufficient for stability of a p matrix a that the inequalities 1 hold for all minors of dispersal less than or equal to d 1 carlson s theorem 3 asserts that the value d n is sufficient for stability in other words that sign symmetric matrices are stable what minimal value of the parameter d would guarantee stability in particular does that value depend on n 3 classes of stable matrices following a conjecture by varga 14 mehrmann 12 showed that matrices of order up to 4 satisfy the inequality arg l a 2 n a 2 2 which is a property stronger than stability however in 11 it was shown that the gkk matrices a 2 k 2 k t of order 2 k 2 defined there are unstable for all integers k k 20 and all sufficiently small positive t and numerical evidence suggests that there may be matrices an k t of smaller order that are unstable for various classes c of matrices this raises the following three questions concerning the subclass cn of all matrices in c of order less than or equal to n 3 a what is the maximum n such that all matrices in class cn are stable 3 b what is the maximum n such that all matrices in class cn satisfy 2 3 c for given n do the stable matrices in class cn satisfy 2 specific classes c of interest include i the class of matrices an k t for positive integers n and k and for t 0 1 ii the class of gkk matrices iii the class of gkk matrices iv the class of matrices 4 assignment of principal minors given n in and numbers p 6 n is there a matrix a such that a p for all this question was originally motivated by the gantmacher krein carlson theo rem 7 and 2 which states that a p matrix a is gkk if and only if its minors satisfy the generalized hadamard fischer inequality a a a a n 3 an answer to problem 4 coupled with inequalities 3 would therefore allow to decide for a collection of positive numbers p whether there exists a gkk matrix such that a p for all since a is determined by the numbers p one could then find at least in principle all possible spectra of gkk matrices this problem is in fact equivalent to a certain inverse eigenvalue problem indeed specifying all principal minors implies specifying characteristic polynomials and hence all eigenvalues of the principal submatrices and vice versa problem 4 can be specialized to various classes of matrices e g hermitian or nonnegative a part of this problem for hermitian matrices is solved in 1 where it is shown how to construct a symmetricm band matrix of order n from the given necessarily real eigenvalues of the m leading principal submatrices of greatest order such a matrix always exists but is not unique whenever the eigenvalues of a 1 j interlace those of a 1 j 1 j n m 1 n 1 notice that by the hermite biehler theorem see e g 4 p 21 two real polynomials p and q have real interlacing roots if and only if the roots of the polynomial p iq are all on the same side of the real axis and the latter can be checked using the hurwitz matrix for the polynomial w z p iz iq iz which is constructed from the coefficients of p and q therefore the interlacing property can be checked using only the coefficients of characteristic polynomials of principal submatrices and these are sums of the given numbers p 3 5 newton s inequalities for a matrix a let cj j a n j j 0 n does any gkk matrix a satisfy the inequalities c 2 j cj 1 cj 1 j 1 n 1 4 this problem has possible subproblems e g 5 a newton s inequalities for m matrices 5 b newton s inequalities for stable gkk matrices these inequalities are known for real diagonal matrices i e simply for sequences of real numbers see 13 and references therein as was first proved by newton since the numbers cj are invariant under similarity newton s inequalities 4 also hold for all diagonalizable matrices with real spectrum and therefore also for the closure of this set viz for all matrices with real spectrum this question arose at an early stage of the work that led to 11 in an attempt to prove that newton s inequalities hold for the gkk matrices and imply their stability when it became clear that there exist p matrices satisfying newton s inequalities that are unstable the author of 11 turned to constructing a coun terexample to the gkk matrix stability conjecture whether gkk matrices satisfy newton s inequalities however is not known yet we hope that consideration of our questions will lead to further
