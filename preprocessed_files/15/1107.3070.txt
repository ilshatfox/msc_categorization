companion matrix to have a certain number of flat portions on the boundary of its numerical range is given the criterion is specialized to the cases of 3 3 and 4 4 matrices in the latter case it is proved that a 4 4 unitarily irreducible companion matrix cannot have 3 flat portions on the boundary of its numerical range numerical examples are given to illustrate the main results mathematics subject classification 2000 15 a 60 keywords numerical range companion matrix 1 introduction the numerical range w a of an n n matrix a is a subset of the complex plane c defined as w a ax x x cn x 1 where stands for the standard inner product in cn this set first appeared in classical works by toeplitz 15 and hausdorff 9 and since then has been studied intensively among standard contemporary references are 7 and 10 chapter i and all properties of the numerical range we will be using without proof can be found e g in these two monographs among other things it is of interest to locate flat portions if any on the boundary w a of the numerical range and in particular to establish a bound for the number f a of such portions for various matrix classes if a is unitarily reducible that is unitarily similar to a block diagonal matrix with at least two diagonal blocks aj then w a is the convex hull of w aj the flat portions on w a are then bound to emerge unless one of w aj contains all others in particular for normal a the blocks aj can be made one dimensional and w a is nothing but the convex hull of the spectrum a it is easy to see therefore that f a is at most n for normal a http arxiv org abs 1107 3070 v 1 2 eldred rodman and spitkovsky the picture is trivial for n 2 f a 0 if a is not normal since w a is then an elliptical disk f a 1 for normal a different from a scalar multiple of the identity since w a is then a line segment and f i 0 for n 3 the classification of possible shapes of w a was given by kippenhahn 12 see also more accessibly 13 from this classification it easily follows that the maximal possible f a is actually attained by normal a while f a is at most two for non normal unitarily reducible matrices and at most one for unitarily irreducible ones constructive descriptions of 3 3 matrices matrices a with flat portions on w a were obtained in 11 14 the case n 4 was undertaken in 2 theorem 37 where it was established the bound 4 is then sharp while for unitarily irreducible 4 4 matrix a the number f a is at most 3 on the other hand for any n there exist n n unitarily reducible matrices a for which f a 2 n 2 see example 38 in 2 suggested to the authors by c k li it is not known when n 4 i whether this delivers the sharp upper bound for f a note that 2 n 2 4 for n 4 and ii what is the upper bound for unitarily irreducible a in this paper we focus on the case when a is a companion matrix that is a 0 1 0 1 a 0 an 2 an 1 1 1 it is well known that the elements of the last row of 1 1 coincide up to the sign with the coefficients of its characteristic polynomial det a i n an 1 n 1 a 0 1 2 these matrices were treated in 6 where in particular it was established that for a companion n n matrix a f a n and all matrices a with f a n were described they happen to be unitarily reducible and the question of the maximal number of flat portions for unitarily irreducible companion matrices also remains open in our paper we further tackle the issue of flat portions on w a for com panion matrices a necessary and sufficient conditions for such portions to exist are described in section 2 for arbitrary n they are rather cumbersome and at least in their sufficient part not easy to check however for n 3 4 they can be recast into constructively verifiable criteria allowing in particular to describe all possible values of f a the cases n 3 and n 4 are treated in sections 3 and 4 respectively 2 conditions for flat portions existence for convenience of reference we start with two statements applicable to arbitrary n n matrices a recall that rea 1 2 a a and ima 1 2 i a a numerical ranges of companion matrices 3 lemma 2 1 let a be an n n matrix a then w a contains a vertical flat portion to the right of w a if and only if i the maximal eigenvalue max of rea is not simple and ii the compression of ima equivalently of a onto the eigenspace l of rea corresponding to max is not a scalar multiple of the identity this lemma is well known and was used e g in 11 2 formally speaking i follows from ii but we prefer i to be stated explic itly since it is the condition addressed in theorem 2 5 below lemma 2 2 let a be an n n matrix a suppose that rea has an eigenvalue of multiplicity bigger that n 2 while the compression of ima onto the corresponding eigenspace l of rea is a scalar multiple of the identity then a is unitarily reducible proof passing from a to a zi with an appropriate choice of z c we may without loss of generality suppose that 0 and the compression of ima onto l kerrea is the zero operator but the latter condition means simply that ima l l since 2 diml n this is only possible if ima is not injective on l that is l contains a non zero vector x from ker ima then x is an eigenvector for both rea and ima equivalently for both a and a which makes it a normally splitting eigenvector for a and a itself unitarily reducible into 1 1 and n 1 n 1 blocks remark 2 3 for n 3 condition on in lemma 2 2 merely means that this is not a simple eigenvalue consequently for unitarily irreducible 3 3 matrices condition ii of lemma 2 1 can be dropped this observation was also used in 11 2 for companion matrices a constructive criterion of unitary reducibility is known it was obtained in 5 section 1 and can be summarized as follows lemma 2 4 an n n companion matrix is unitarily reducible if and only if a j j j 1 1 j j j 2 for some c 0 and partition j 1 j 2 of 1 n where both j 1 and j 2 are non empty 1 n being the set of all nth roots of 1 if this condition holds then a is unitarily similar to a 1 a 2 with a 1 j j j 1 a 2 1 j j j 2 the matrix a is unitary if 1 and a 1 a 2 are unitarily irreducible otherwise we are now ready to state the necessary condition for the flat portion exis tence theorem 2 5 let a be given by 1 1 then for w a to have a flat portion on the boundary it is necessary that n 2 j 0 aj n j sin j 1 n sin n 2 1 4 eldred rodman and spitkovsky and re an 1 n 1 j 2 j 2 cos n cos j n cos n 2 2 for some with 1 and j 1 2 n sin j n 1 n n 2 k 0 ak n k sin j k 1 n 2 3 if conditions 2 1 2 2 hold then the potential flat portion passes through the point cos n and has the slope 2 arg proof observe first of all that for any with absolute value one the matrix a while not being companion itself for 6 1 is nevertheless unitarily similar to a companion matrix b 0 1 0 1 b 0 bn 2 bn 1 where bj aj n j a 1 b with diag 1 n 1 2 4 consequently w a w a w b it therefore suffices to show that conditions 2 1 2 2 with 1 are necessary for w a to contain a vertical line segment located to the right of w a and that this line segment if it exists passes through the real point cos n let us show that 2 1 2 2 can be interpreted as condition i of lemma 2 1 for a given by 1 1 due to the interlacing property of eigenvalues of hermitian matrices max will be the maximal eigenvalue of all n 1 n 1 principal submatrices of a for a given by 1 1 rea 1 2 t a 0 an 3 1 an 2 a 0 an 3 1 an 2 2 rean 1 2 5 numerical ranges of companion matrices 5 where t is the n 1 n 1 tridiagonal matrix with zeros on the main diagonal and ones on two side diagonals t 0 1 1 1 1 0 the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of t are well known namely see e g 8 or 1 section 2 2 tvj 2 cos j n vj j 1 n 1 where vj sin j n sin j n 1 n t 2 6 so the abscissa of the potential vertical flat portion is indeed cos n on the other hand the left upper n 1 n 1 block of a is the jordan cell jn 1 so that w a w jn 1 in its turn w jn 1 z z cos n see e g 8 so that the above mentioned flat portion should be passing through the real point cos n as it is stated in 8 and can also be checked via a routine trigonometrical calculation vj 2 n 2 for all j therefore the matrix v 2 n sin jk n n 1 k j 1 2 7 is an hermitian actually real symmetric involution which diagonalizes t t 2 v diag cos n cos n 1 n v consequently matrix 2 5 is unitarily similar to h cos n cos n 1 n 1 n 1 1 n 1 re an 1 2 8 where j 1 2 n sin j n 1 n n 2 k 0 ak sin j k 1 n observe that the latter formula is the particular case of 2 3 for 1 from 2 8 it is easily seen that det h cos n i 1 2 n 1 j 2 cos j n cos n 6 eldred rodman and spitkovsky thus cos n is an eigenvalue of h and therefore of rea if and only if 1 0 this coincides with 2 1 in which 1 the multiplicity of cos n as an eigenvalue of rea cannot exceed 2 since the matrix h cos n i contains a non singular n 2 n 2 submatrix diag cos j n cos n n 1 j 2 in order for this multiplicity to equal 2 it is necessary and sufficient that in addition to 1 0 the right lower n 1 n 1 submatrix of h cos ni cos 2 n cos n cos n 1 n cos n 2 n 1 2 n 1 rean 1 cos n is singular this is an arrowheadmatrix the determinant of which can be computed by an easy induction and equals n 1 j 2 j 2 cos n cos j n re an 1 cos n n 1 j 2 cos j n cos n thus it equals zero if and only if 2 2 holds once again with 1 note that necessity of condition 2 1 in a slightly different way was estab lished in 6 see lemma 3 there it follows from lemma 2 4 and theorem 2 5 that in the generic case matrices 1 1 are unitarily irreducible and have no flat portions on the boundary namely the set of companion matrices for which 2 1 has no unimodular solutions is open and dense within the set of all companion matrices the openness of this set is clear from continuity of roots of algebraic equations as functions of the equations coefficients as for denseness assume a 0 6 0 and let n 2 j 0 aj n j sin j 1 n sin n a 0 1 n where 1 n are all the roots of 2 1 counted with multiplicities note that 1 n 1 n 1 a 10 sin n and n j 1 1 j 0 we now perturb 1 n slightly resulting in 1 n respectively such that none of the js is unimodular and the equality n j 1 j 1 0 holds clearly such perturbation is possible now define a 0 a n by the equalities 1 n 1 n 1 a 0 1 sin n numerical ranges of companion matrices 7 and n 2 j 0 a j n j sin j 1 n sin n a 0 1 n as a result a companion matrix is obtained as close as we wish to a for which the corresponding equation 2 1 has no unimodular solutions a specific subclass of unitarily irreducible companion matrices with no flat portions on the boundary of their numerical ranges is delivered by the following corollary 2 6 let a be given by 1 1 with a 0 an 2 0 2 9 then a is unitarily irreducible and w a has no flat portions on the boundary indeed such a are singular and therefore as follows from lemma 2 4 uni tarily irreducible on the other hand equation 2 1 takes the form 0 sin n and thus has no solutions note that if in addition to 2 9 also an 1 0 then a is simply a nilpotent jordan block with w a being a circular disk if an 1 6 0 the numerical range of a cannot be circular according to 6 theorem 1 but still there will be no flat portions on w a an example illustrating this more interesting situation when n 4 will be given in section 4 of course a criterion for the flat portion existence can be formulated by im posing condition ii of lemma 2 1 interpreted for the case of companion matrices on matrices satisfying theorem 2 5 theorem 2 7 let conditions 2 1 2 2 hold for some matrix a given by 1 1 and having absolute value 1 then w a has a flat portion passing through cos n if and only if at least one of the scalar products im a x 1 x 2 and im a x 2 x 2 differs from zero here x 1 1 v 1 0 x 2 1 v 0 0 1 2 10 with v 1 and v given by 2 4 2 6 and 2 7 respectively 0 2 n 1 1 t and j j cos n cos j n j 2 n 1 proof under conditions of theorem 2 5 and in the notation of its proof vectors 1 0 0 t cn and form a basis of ker h cos n i consequently 2 10 delivers a basis for l ker rea cos n i since im a x 1 x 1 im jn 1 v 1 v 1 0 the compression of im a onto l is a scalar multiple of the identity if and only if it equals zero this is equivalent to im a x 1 x 2 im a x 2 x 2 0 it remains to invoke lemma 2 1 8 eldred rodman and spitkovsky thus the number of flat portions on the boundary of the numerical range of the matrix 1 1 coincides with the number of distinct solutions of 2 1 2 2 for which 1 and the if and only if conditions of theorem 2 7 are satisfied 3 3 3 matrices as was mentioned in the introduction the case n 2 is trivial and there is no need to consider companion 2 2 matrices 0 1 a 0 a 1 3 1 separately nevertheless note that conditions 2 1 2 2 in this case amount to a 0 2 0 re a 1 0 they hold if and only if a 0 1 and 2 arga 1 arg a 0 the latter condition being redundant when a 1 0 these are exactly the requirements for 3 1 to be normal as it should be we move therefore to the case n 3 theorem 3 1 let a be a 3 3 companion matrix a 0 1 0 0 0 1 a 0 a 1 a 2 then w a contains a flat portion if and only if the equation a 0 3 a 1 2 1 3 2 has a solution with 1 in addition satisfying 2 re a 2 a 0 2 1 3 3 and the triple a 0 a 1 a 2 differs from a 0 2 3 a 1 3 2 w a 2 3 2 w 3 4 where 1 and w is any cube root of 1 proof necessity of 3 2 3 3 follows directly from theorem 2 5 indeed 2 1 for n 3 takes the form 3 2 while 2 3 for n 3 and j 2 yields 2 1 2 2 1 a 0 3 a 1 2 taking 3 2 into consideration we conclude further that 2 a 0 3 2 based on this observation 2 2 with n 3 turns into 3 3 sufficiency conditions 3 2 3 3 being the 3 3 version of 2 1 2 2 guarantee that the maximal eigenvalue of re a is not simple by remark 2 3 for 3 3 matrices this implies the existence of a flat portion on w a with a numerical ranges of companion matrices 9 slope 2 arg provided that a is unitarily irreducible it remains therefore to consider the case of unitarily reducible a according to lemma 2 4 in the case n 3 the eigenvalues of a unitarily reducible a are 1 1 2 2 3 3 with j corresponding to the three cube roots of unity in no particular order and some non zero moreover a is then unitarily similar to the orthogonal sum of a 2 2 block a 2 with the eigenvalues 1 2 and the 1 1 block a 1 3 letting r and arg we therefore conclude from vieta s formulas that a 0 1 2 3 2 re 3 i a 1 1 2 1 3 2 3 2 1 2 1 2 3 r 2 1 e 2 i 3 a 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 r 2 1 r ei 3 if r 1 then a 1 a 2 0 a 0 1 so that 3 3 is a tautology while 3 2 has three equidistant solutions on the unit circle the matrix a is in this case unitary and w a has three flat portions on the boundary on the other hand 3 3 implies that 2 a 2 a 0 2 1 that is 2 r 2 1 r r 2 1 if r 6 1 this is only possible when r 2 due to the unitary similarity of a and a 1 a 2 the numerical range w a is the convex hull of 3 and w a 2 the latter in its turn is the ellipse with the foci at 1 2 and the major axis of the length tr a 2 a 2 1 2 2 2 1 2 2 tr a a 1 2 2 2 3 2 1 2 2 2 a 0 2 a 1 2 a 2 2 2 r 2 r 2 3 r 2 1 r 2 r 4 while 1 3 2 3 r 1 r 1 3 r 2 r 1 3 2 1 r 2 r 2 but 2 1 r 2 r 2 1 r 2 r 4 for 0 r 2 while for r 2 the equality is attained consequently the point 3 lies outside the ellipse w a 2 and their convex hull has two flat portions on the boundary unless r 2 it remains to observe that the case r 2 corresponds exactly to the exception 3 4 note that example 6 in 6 is a particular case of 3 4 corresponding to w 1 10 eldred rodman and spitkovsky companion 3 3 matrices with elliptical numerical ranges were treated in 3 based on the tests proposed in 11 according to kippenhahn s classification see 13 for irreducible 3 3 companion matrices a not satisfying conditions of 3 or our theorem 3 1 w a has ovular shape we remark that 3 3 is a tautology if a 2 0 a 0 1 it has no unimodular solutions if 2 a 0 a 0 2 1 and its automatically unimodular solutions are given by a 0 2 1 i 4 a 2 2 a 0 2 1 2 2 a 2 in the remaining case 0 6 2 a 2 a 0 2 1 so conditions 3 2 3 3 can be recast as follows either a 2 0 a 0 1 and a 0 3 a 1 2 1 for some unimodular 3 5 or a 2 6 0 2 a 2 a 0 2 1 3 6 and a 0 a 0 2 1 i 4 a 2 2 a 0 2 1 2 3 2 a 1 a 2 a 0 2 1 i 4 a 2 2 a 0 2 1 2 2 8 a 32 3 7 for some choice of 1 example 1 let a 0 2 i a 1 1 i and a 2 2 3 i so that we have a 0 1 0 0 0 1 2 i 1 i 2 3 i 3 8 then 3 3 holds with 1 the exception 3 4 does not hold and 3 2 has only one unimodular solution 1 1 thus the matrix a given by 3 8 has one vertical flat portion on the boundary of its numerical range as such this a is automatically unitarily irreducible the respective w a is pictured in figure 1 below 1 1 all numerical ranges are plotted using the program by c cowen and e harel available at http www math iupui edu ccowen downloads 33 numrange html http www math iupui edu ccowen

in this section we consider the case n 4 that is a 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 a 0 a 1 a 2 a 3 4 1 after some simple algebra equations 2 1 and 2 2 take the form a 0 4 2 a 1 3 a 2 2 1 4 2 and 2 re a 3 2 2 2 3 2 1 4 3 respectively on the other hand a computation shows that the j s defined by 2 3 with n 4 are given by the formulas 2 1 2 2 1 a 0 4 a 2 2 3 1 4 1 a 0 4 2 a 1 3 a 2 2 which simplify further by using 4 2 to 2 a 1 3 2 a 0 4 2 3 1 2 a 1 3 4 4 substitute 4 4 for 2 and 3 in the right hand side of 4 3 to yield 2 re a 3 a 0 a 1 a 0 2 a 1 2 1 4 5 so the system of equations 2 1 2 2 is equivalent to the system 4 2 4 5 12 eldred rodman and spitkovsky similarly to the situation for n 3 4 5 is a tautology if a 3 a 0 a 1 a 0 2 a 1 2 1 4 6 it has no unimodular solutions if 2 a 3 a 0 a 1 a 0 2 a 1 2 1 and its au tomatically unimodular solutions are given by a 0 2 a 1 2 1 i 2 a 3 a 0 a 1 2 a 0 2 a 1 2 1 2 2 a 3 a 0 a 1 4 7 in the remaining case 0 6 a 3 a 0 a 1 1 2 a 0 2 a 1 2 1 we thus obtain the following corollary 4 1 let a be given by 4 1 then for w a to have a flat portion on the boundary it is necessary that a 3 a 0 a 1 1 2 a 0 2 a 1 2 1 and 4 2 has a unimodular solution moreover this must coincide with one of the values given by 4 7 unless 4 6 holds and corresponds to the flat portion if any with the slope 2 arg this result is instrumental in establishing a peculiar gap in the number of possible flat portions for 4 4 companion matrices theorem 4 2 there are no 4 4 companion matrices a with f a 3 proof let us first address the case when a is unitarily reducible according to lemma 2 4 it is then either unitary with the eigenvalues located in the vertices of a square centered at the origin in which case f a 4 or is unitarily similar to the orthogonal sum of two unitarily irreducible blocks if these blocks are both 2 2 then w a is the convex hull of two ellipses the construction that can a priori have 0 2 or 4 flat portions though the case f a 4 does not materialize as shown in 6 but not 1 or 3 finally if a reduces to the orthogonal sum of a 1 1 and 3 3 block then the numerical range of the latter has no flat portions on the boundary according to 4 theorem 2 5 which leaves only options f a 0 2 possible now let a be unitarily irreducible applying corollary 4 1 we see that f a 3 is only possible when 4 6 holds and moreover 4 2 has at least three distinct unimodular solutions say u v and w we consider separately the cases a 0 0 and a 0 6 0 case 1 a 0 0 the second equality in 4 6 then implies that a 1 1 on the other hand equation 4 2 in this case has degree 3 and therefore u v w are numerical ranges of companion matrices 13 all its roots by the vieta theorem uvw 1 2 a 1 which is in contradiction with the unimodularity of u v w case 2 a 0 6 0 then 4 2 has the fourth root also different from zero since the linear term is missing in 4 2 the inverses of the roots have zero sum in other words the fourth root is 1 u 1 v 1 w 1 1 z where we have denoted z u v w other parts of the vieta theorem mean that uvw z 1 a 0 z 1 z 2 a 1 a 0 taking absolute values we obtain a 0 z a 1 z 2 1 2 when combined with the second equality in 4 6 this implies z 1 conse quently a 1 0 equation 4 2 is therefore biquadratic its roots come in opposite pairs and without loss of generality may be relabeled as u v by the same vieta theorem a 0 u 2 v 2 a 2 u 2 v 2 4 8 while we have established that conditions of corollary 4 1 hold for four dis tinct unimodular values of this does not necessarily mean that four flat portions actually materialize so further reasoning is needed in order to arrive at a contra diction the first equality in 4 6 and the equality a 1 0 proven earlier imply that a 3 0 as well so the characteristic polynomial 1 2 in our case also is biquadratic and the eigenvalues of a equal 1 2 with 21 22 being the roots of the quadratic equation 2 a 2 a 0 0 the ratio of these roots is obviously a negative real number when a 2 0 supposing a 2 6 0 on the other hand we obtain 21 22 a 2 a 22 4 a 0 a 2 a 22 4 a 0 a 2 a 22 4 a 0 2 4 a 0 2 a 22 4 a 0 2 a 2 a 22 4 a 0 4 a 0 1 a 2 2 a 2 a 22 4 a 0 2 a 0 1 1 1 4 a 0 a 2 2 2 a 0 a 2 2 1 1 2 2 a 0 a 2 2 1 2 a 0 a 2 2 1 1 2 x 1 x 4 9 14 eldred rodman and spitkovsky where x 2 a 0 a 22 using 4 8 x 2 u 2 v 2 u 2 v 2 2 1 1 re u v 2 and is therefore a positive real number since for all such x 1 2 x 1 x expression 4 9 is again negative so the eigenvalues 1 2 of a are located at the vertices of a rhombus centered at the origin according to 5 this implies unitary reducibility of a a contradiction therefore f a 3 is an impossibility in this case as well which concludes the proof example 2 we provide an explicit example of when a is a unitarily irre ducible 4 4 companion matrix and f a 2 let a 0 9 12 i 25 a 1 2 2 7 i 25 a 2 4 3 4 i 25 and a 3 6 2 1 i 25 so that we have a 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 9 12 i 25 2 2 7 i 25 4 3 4 i 25 6 2 1 i 25 4 10 the eigenvalues ofa 0 6413 0 8475 i 0 6264 0 5578 i 1 0468 0 4290 i 0 5603 0 2000 i each have a different magnitude and therefore lemma 2 4 again a is not unitarily reducible we also see that for the matrix a given by 4 10 that 4 6 holds and 4 2 has two unimodular solutions 1 1 and 2 i and two non unimodular solutions 3 2 i and 4 1 3 2 i 3 moreover for a 1 1 a a rea 1 has two linearly independent eigenvectors f 1 2 2 1 2 2 0 t and f 2 2 23 14 i 25 37 16 i 25 0 1 t corresponding to the maximal eigen value of 2 2 computing the scalar product ima 1 f 1 f 2 2 7 24 i 25 6 0 we see that indeed w a has a vertical flat portion on the boundary simi larly for a 2 2 a ia rea 2 has two linearly independent eigenvectors g 1 1 2 i 1 0 t and g 2 2 2 11 i 25 13 16 i 25 0 1 t corresponding to the maximal eigenvalue of 2 2 while ima 2 g 1 g 2 36 2 i 25 6 0 therefore w a also has a horizontal flat portion on its boundary thus the matrix a given by 4 10 has two flat portions on the boundary of w a as shown in figure 2 numerical ranges of companion matrices 15 2 5 2 1 5

irreducible 4 4 companion matrix and f a 1 let a 0 0 a 1 1 a 2 1 2 and a 3 0 so that we have a 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 2 0 4 11 then 4 6 holds and 4 2 has only one unimodular solution 1 1 more

see indeed that w a has a vertical flat portion on the boundary thus the matrix a given by 4 11 has one flat portion on the boundary of w a as shown in figure 3 16 eldred rodman and spitkovsky 2 5 2 1

irreducibil ity of the matrix 4 11 as was shown in the proof of theorem 4 2 see the first paragraph there finally let us provide an example of a 4 4 matrix satisfying conditions of corollary 2 6 and
