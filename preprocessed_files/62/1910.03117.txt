of defining the cdf of one random variable as one minus the pdf of another the present work also extends the results to exponential and pareto distributions which are empirically relevant for studying income and wealth ch did not consider such unbounded dis tributions and ll only prove a weaker result than their main theorem for the unbounded case lemma 2 in ll for exponential and thicker tailed distributions corollary 8 below shows that most pairs of signals produce the counterintuitive fosd ranking in contrast to the proofs of ch and ll which rely on two specific signal realizations the first substantive section establishes the connection between ll and ch after that sec tion 3 studies the limitations of the results providing a sufficient condition to rule out the coun terintuitive ranking of conditional distributions section 4 extends the counterintuitive fosd ordering to unbounded distributions including exponential and pareto 2 the connection between the previous papers before stating the results the notation is introduced in table 1 after that the central inequality in the first theorem in ll is generalized as theorem 1 below the proof is modeled on the main result of ch but introduces the trick of constructing a cdf as one minus the pdf of another random variable table 1 notation correspondence this paper ch ll x x v n z z v n fx f fz x z x gx z a b a b 0 1 or v v e x z bi bi theorem 1 fix any a b there exists a family of conditional signal distributions fz x x such that for any x with support a b fx z b strictly first order stochastically dominates fx z 2 b a furthermore fz x x forms an independent additive signal and each fz x x is uni modal there exists a signal s such that fx s s z fx z z proof w l o g let a 0 b 1 let the signal pdf be the union of a right angled triangle and a 2 rectangle fz x z x 1 2 3 z x if z x x 1 1 3 if z x 1 x 2 the noise term z x is additive and independent the positive mean of 0 simplifies formulas and is w l o g because bayes rule de biases the signal conditional on z 2 2 b a the posterior equals the prior fx z x z fx x for all x conditional on z 1 b integrating by parts yields the posterior fx z w z w 0 x z

the numerator of 1 is fx w 3 2 z w 0 1 fx x fx w dx fx w 3 2 z w 0 1 fx x dx fx w 3 2 z 1 0 1 fx x dx the term in braces is the denominator of fx z w z thus dividing by it yields fx z w z fx w fx z w

1 to the best of the author s knowledge the technique in theorem 1 of constructing a signal s from another signal z such that the information content of observing s b is equivalent to z b is new the main difficulty in the proof is to ensure that the cdf of s which equals one minus the pdf of z is increasing and has the maximum value 1 theorem 1 implies the following corollary which is the central inequality in the first theorem of ll corollary 2 for every bounded random variable x there exist a noise variable and cutoffs b 1 b 2 such that e x x b 1 e x e x x b 2 proof w l o g let x 0 x 1 take b 1 1 b 2 2 and s x where the cdf of s is defined in the proof of theorem 1 then fx s s 1 fx s s 2 fx i e fx s s 1 strictly fosds fx s s 2 this implies e x x 1 e x x 2 e x claim 1 in ll says that for every bounded random variable x there exists a continuous noise variable and cutoffs b 1 b 2 such that e x x b 1 e x x b 2 this claim is strengthened in the following corollary which is derived analogously to ch 3 corollary 3 for every bounded x there exist a continuous noise variable and cutoffs b 1 b 2 such that for s x and any w 0 1 fx s w s b 1 fx s w s b 2 proof take 0 1 small 1 2 1 and h 2 2 2 and define fz x z x 1 z x 1 h if z x x h z x if z x x 1 h z x 1 h if z x 1 x 1 2 conditional on z 1 the posterior is fx z w z w 0 h z x dfx x 1 0 h z y dfx y w 0 h 1 x dfx x 1 0 h 1 y dfx y which strictly fosds the prior clearly lim 0 fx z w z fx w for any w conditional on z 1 the posterior is fx z w z w 0 1 z x 1 h dfx x 1 0 1 z y 1 h dfx y w 0 1 h z x dfx x 1 0 1 h z y dfx y the same reasoning as in the proof of theorem 1 establishes that fx z w z fx w indepen dently of therefore there exists 0 s t for all 0 fx z w z fx z w z take fs x 1 fz x b 1 z 1 and b 2 z 1 to complete the proof corollary 3 concludes the generalization of ll using ch the next section delimits the results by providing sufficient conditions for an updated distribution given a lower signal not to fosd the distribution given a higher signal after that the counterintuitive ranking is extended to the unbounded exponential and pareto distributions 3 ruling out a counterintuitive fosd order the following lemma provides conditions that preclude the counterintuitive fosd ranking found in theorem 1 and corollary 3 the intuition for the conditions is that either a lower signal rules out some large values of x which a higher signal permits or a higher signal rules out small realizations of x which a lower signal allows to state the lemma denote the range of the bounds of its support by lemma 4 fix and z 1 z 2 if either x z 1 z 2 or x z 1 z 2 has positive probability then fx z z 1 does not fosd fx z z 2 even weakly 4 proof if pr x z 1 z 2 0 then z 1 rules out the high values x z 1 z 2 of x which z 2 allows this implies fx z x z 1 1 fx z x z 2 if pr x z 1 z 2 0 then z 2 rules out the low realizations x z 1 z 2 of x which z 1 permits this implies fx z x z 1 0 fx z x z 2 for some x z 1 z 2 lemma 4 only rules out a fosd ranking non monotone in specific signals or non monotone in the lower cutoff for the transformed signal s used in theorem 1 the conditional expectation of x given a signal above a cutoff may still be non monotone in the cutoff 1 i e the ll result may still hold when the stronger ch result fails the next corollary gives sufficient conditions for no pair of signals to generate the reversed fosd ranking found in theorem 1 and corollary 3 the sufficient conditions hold when x is unbounded and has a positive density but the noise is bounded the conditions also hold when both x and are bounded below but not above or both above but not below corollary 5 if the support a b of x is an interval and either i b a ii and b or iii and a then for any z 1 z 2 fx z z 1 does not fosd fx z z 2 even weakly proof if the support a b of x is an interval and b a then for any z 1 z 2 either pr x z 1 z 2 0 or pr x z 1 z 2 0 so lemma 4 applies if then w l o g take 0 because translating the signal z does not affect bayesian updating if 0 then zi rules out x zi so conditional on z 1 x z 1 z 2 is impossible if b and the support of x is an interval then for any possible z 2 z 1 a the support of x contains z 1 z 2 thus for 0 small enough fx z z 2 z 1 0 fx z z 2 z 2 if but then w l o g take 0 if a and z 1 z 2 b then z 1 z 2 is in the support of x so for 0 small enough fx z z 1 z 1 1 fx z z 1 z 2 an open question is whether the reversed fosd ranking can be generated for some signals when both x and are unbounded below and above the next section establishes the reversed ranking for x bounded on one side and bounded on the opposite side or unbounded 4 variable of interest bounded on one side the following theorem proves that the counterintuitive ranking of conditional distributions occurs for a wide range of signals when x is bounded on at least one side corollaries of this result cover the empirically relevant exponential and pareto distributions as discussed subsequently the theorem allows both independent and dependent x and 1 for example take fx x 1 1 0 1 x where is the standard normal pdf and 0 is small enough and use the signal cdf fs x and cutoffs a 2 b a from the proof of theorem 1 5 theorem 6 if x b and d ln fz x z x dz decreases in x then dfx z w z dz 0 for any w b with strict inequality if d ln fz x z dz is strictly decreasing and w a b proof recall that a infx b the derivative of fx z w z w r t z is w a dfz x z x dz dfx x b a fz x z y dfx y b a dfz x z y dz dfx y w a fz x z x dfx x b a fz x z y dfx y 2 nonnegative iff w a dfz x z x dz dfx x w a fz x z x dfx x b a dfz x z y dz dfx y b a fz x z y dfx y 3 at w b equality holds in 3 the lhs of 3 is continuous in w even if dfz x z x dz has jumps so if the lhs decreases in w then the lhs exceeds the rhs at all w if fx has a discontinuity of height hx at x then the dirac delta function x is used to represent the density fx x hx x define h z x d ln fz x z x dz because dfz x z x dz fz x z x h z x the derivative of the lhs of 3 w r t w is fz x z w h z w fx w w a fz x z x dfx x fz x z w fx w w a fz x z x h z x dfx x w a fz x z x dfx x 2 fz x z w fx w w a h z w h z x fz x z x dfx x w a fz x z x dfx x 2 0 because h z is decreasing therefore dfx z w z dz 0 which implies that for any z 1 z 2 close enough to z fx z w z 1 fosds fx z w z 2 if h z strictly decreases then dfx z w z dz 0 the assumption x b in theorem 6 is for comparability to ch switching the signs of x z a b and w yields the following corollary corollary 7 if x a and d ln fz x z x dz decreases in x then dfx z w z dz 0 for any w a with strict inequality if d ln fz x z dz is strictly decreasing and w a b if the noise is independent of x then theorem 6 may be restated as follows corollary 8 if is independent of x b and there exists s t f f increases for then fx z w z 1 fx z w z 2 for any w b and z 2 z 1 b and if f f strictly increases then fx z w z 1 fx z w z 2 proof define z z f z x z x f z x and apply theorem 6 if d ln f z x dz decreases in x at one z b then it decreases in x at any z b therefore df x z w z dz dfx z w z dz 0 for any z b so fx z w z 1 fx z w z 2 for any z 2 z 1 b if d ln f z x dz strictly decreases then df x z w z dz 0 6 the noise in corollary 8 has to be unbounded above if x is unbounded below as corollary 5 shows the noise may be symmetric single peaked and mean zero but these conditions are not necessary 2 if x and are bounded then the result of corollary 8 holds for b a and z 1 z 2 b a the result does not extend to a fosd reversal for all signal pairs z 1 z 2 even if because z 1 b rules out x z 1 b that z 2 b permits the assumptions of corollary 8 are satisfied by exponential noise f e for 0 as well as any other noise pdf thicker tailed than exponential such noise distributions are relevant in practice for example in detecting tax evasion suppose the log of income or wealth is x b 0 with fx x e x because empirically income and wealth follow pareto distributions the log declared income is z x so x z 0 is the log of the fraction of income that is declared the tax authority observes a specific taxpayer s log declared income z and bayesian updates its belief about the true income conditional on observable characteristics of the taxpayer the updated distribution over income levels given a lower declaration fosds the distribution given a higher reported income another interpretation is that x b 0 is wealth 0 the amount by which wealth is underreported and z x the reported wealth with fx and f pareto distributions empirically the conditional expectation of true wealth or income decreases over a range of declared wealth or income levels alstads ter et al 2019 3 show that in the bottom deciles of declared wealth a lower declaration is associated with a greater fraction of tax evaders and larger evasion amounts for income and wealth total wealth is larger for the first decile of disclosed wealth than for the second in artavanis et al 2016 the three bottom income bins exhibit a negative correlation between the income declared on the tax return and the income the authors infer from the credit extended by a bank fagereng et al 2019 find that the fraction of income saved decreases in declared wealth for households declaring negative wealth but increases for positive wealth households the median capital gains rate decreases fastest for the lowest wealth percentiles thus households whose net wealth is more negative seem to obtain higher returns on assets and save more which suggests they under report assets to a greater extent johannesen et al 2018 figure a 1 shows that among the us persons in the offshore voluntary disclosure program the ratio of the disclosed account value to the capital income in the previous year is decreasing and convex in their capital income percentile up to the 90 th percentile in other words those who previously declared less capital income have disproportionately larger offshore accounts alstads ter et al 2019 find that conditional on hiding wealth the fraction hidden is approx 2 to define a signal s such that the event s z contains the same information as z z as in theorem 1 the pdf of z needs to be decreasing with a maximum value 1 in this case f cannot be symmetric 3 alstads ter et al 2019 online appendix table j 1 excel file ajzappendixh sheets distribevasion tostata and file ajzappendixg sheet discloser nor 1 7 imately 30 at all wealth levels the fraction of income undeclared is about 40 conditional on under reporting independently of wealth the probability of hiding wealth rises with wealth which may be modelled as follows denote the probability of evading taxes at negative wealth x x by p x 0 the pdf of the fraction of income declared conditional on evading by g and the dirac delta function at by define the noise pdf as f x x p x 0 1 p x g then fx z w z 1 z wfx z p z w fx x 1 p x g z x dx 1 z 0 fx z p z 0 fx y 1 p y g z y dy which implies that for any continuous g there exists z 0 such that for any z 0 z and w 0 fx z w 0 w fx x 1 p x g x dx fx 0 p 0 0 fx y 1 p y g y dy w fx x 1 p x g z x dx 0 fx y 1 p y g z y dy fx z w z if g e with 0 or g is thicker tailed than exponential then z 5 discussion the connection established in this note between ch and ll allows using the stronger result in the former to study the diverse applications in the latter for example a journal editor screening papers based on referee reports may obtain not just a better expected quality of papers by reducing the acceptance cutoff but a fosd improved distribution of quality a bank choosing borrowers or an investor picking projects based on quantitative criteria such as credit ratings may shift the return distribution up in the fosd sense by relaxing the criteria the optimal strategy of accepting applicants to educational institutions or conducting an affirmative action policy may not be monotone in people s observable characteristics switching to a better strategy may improve outcomes at every point of the distribution of characteristics similarly in an auction requiring the opening bid to be in a disconnected set as opposed to above a cutoff may fosd improve the revenue distribution the extension of the results to unbounded distributions in particular exponential and pareto opens up additional applications tax evasion and measurement errors in the wealth and income distributions for example the asset distribution of people reporting a lower wealth level may fosd the distribution of those making a higher report the extended results hold for a wide range of signal pairs thus the fosd reversal is a robust phenomenon a notes on other results in ll ll theorem 2 implicitly assumes that the utility functions are strictly increasing and the fosd ranking of the conditional distributions fx z z 1 z 2 is strict if weak fosd is allowed then the 8 signal z could be uninformative over an interval z 1 z 2 in which case the expected value e x z z xe of the random variable of interest is the same for any z z 1 z 2 then for any utility function u such that u xe 0 there is a continuum of optimal strategies because changing the acceptance probability on any subset of z 1 z 2 results in a different optimal strategy most of these optimal strategies are not cutoff strategies if u is permitted to be zero on an interval x 1 x 2 of realizations of x then there is similarly a continuum of optimal non cutoff strategies that differ by the acceptance probability on x 1 x 2 the statement of claim 3 in ll only assumes x is continuous and z x is dis crete with finite support n 1 n 2 nk but the proof implicitly assumes that x is bounded above x x the proof uses the sets a x nk 1 x nk 1 and b x nk 1 x nk 1 to define the support supp x a suppfx z a and similarly for b if x then supp x a supp x b and the probabilities pr x x a and pr x x b are undefined references alstads ter a n johannesen and g zucman 2019 tax
