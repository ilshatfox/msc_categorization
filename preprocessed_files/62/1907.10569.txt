health division of biostatistics and bioinformatics university of cincinnati 160 panzeca way cincinnati oh 45267 0056 abstract the problem tackled in this paper is the determination of sample size for a given level and power in the context of a simple linear regression model at a technical level the simple linear regression model is a five parameter model it is natural to base sample size calculations on the least squares estimator of the slope parameter of the model nuisance parameters such as the variance of the predictor x and conditional variance of the response y create problems in the calculations the current approaches in the literature are not illuminating one approach is based on the conditional distribution of the estimator of the slope parameter given the data on the predictor x another approach is based on the sample correlation coefficient we overcome the problems by determining the exact unconditional distribution of the test statistic built on the estimator of the slope parameter the exact unconditional distribution alleviates difficulties to some extent in the computation of sample sizes on the other hand the test based on the sample correlation coefficient of x and y avoids the problems besetting the test based on the slope parameter however we lose intuitive interpretation that comes with the slope parameter surprisingly we see that the sample size that comes from the correlation test works in synchronization with the one that comes from the test built upon the slope parameter in a broad array of settings key words level power simple linear regression normal covariate sample size 1 introduction multiple regression is one of the core methodologies in statistics power computation and sample size determination have become integral part of many research proposals submitted for funding horton and switzer 2005 report that 51 of research articles published in the new england journal of medicine during 2004 05 have multiple regression as one of the methods used the figure for power analysis was 39 in this paper we focus on power computation in the context of simple linear regression is there a problem in this setting regression methodology has a long history dating back to galton 1885 funding agencies such as nih national institute of health have been demanding sample size calculations in the proposals since its inception we point out difficulties in this setting see ryan 2013 to provide a background and rationale of our work we first review how sample size is determined in the literature under the simple linear regression paradigm a simple linear 2 regression model has two entities x the predictor and y the response variable the model is stated as for some and 0 the hypothesis of interest is 0 against the alternative 0 what should be the required sample size for a given level of significance power 1 and at the alternative value a of let x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 xn yn n independent realizations of x y be a potential sample for the testing problem let 1 be the least squares estimator of 1 i e where and let rss be the residual sum of squares i e for testing the null hypothesis h 0 we use the test statistic 2 under the null hypothesis conditioned on the x data has a distribution with 2 degrees of freedom and under the alternative hypothesis a has a non central distribution with degrees of freedom n 2 and non centrality parameter we reject null hypothesis if and only if where is such that the area to the left of student s t curve is 1 the power formula is given by power we can set power 1 and solve for n this would work as long as we know what is this would require knowledge of the alternative value of 1 2 and sxx critically we should know for each n what xi values are so that n i i xxn 1 2 1 is a constant equivalently one should spell out what is this is a tall order adcock 1997 recognized these problems some software and textbooks do assume that 3 n i i xxn 1 2 1 is known and a constant for example the software pass and nquery do proceed this way more realistically sampling is done on x y simultaneously in that case we cannot use t to accommodate this scenario we proceed with deriving the exact unconditional distribution of a variant of t we will assume that the predictor x has a normal distribution with mean x and standard deviation x the five parameter model now is x n x we will use a variant of t by utilizing the standard unbiased estimator of we use the same notation t 1 where and as an alternative to 1 one can use the correlation coefficient between y and x the correlation has an explicit formula the statement 1 0 is equivalent to 0 one can use the sample correlation coefficient to build a test for testing 0 the null distribution of the test statistic based on is elegant and its non null distribution is tractable we can carry out power calculations of the test based on with a great degree of ease however many researchers prefer to use the test based on because 1 has an easy and physical interpretation ryan 2013 technically we cannot use the sample size calculated based on with the test based on really we show that there is a good agreement in sample sizes calculated in the environment of both the tests in a broad array of settings test hopping is feasible after all the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we provide a literature review and outline main results in section 3 we derive the unconditional distribution of t under the null hypothesis in section 4 we calculate critical values using the main result of section 3 in section 5 we lay out the sample sizes required for a given level power and effect size in section 6 we take up the problem of finding sample sizes based on the correlation in section 7 we contrast the sample sizes in section 8 the paper is summarized and conclusions are drawn 2 literature review and main results outlined 4 ryan has pointed out difficulties in power calculations in the environment of simple linear regression ryan 2013 the problem is how we handle the predictor x adcock has looked at some possible scenarios adcock 1997 one scenario is that the investigator knows the xi values deterministic for every sample size n in such a case the test statistic 2 2 is eminently usable for power calculations its conditional null and non null distributions have been worked out explicitly the software pass requires specification of size alternative value of 1 sxx sample size and error standard deviation for power calculation the software nquery also follows the same route dupont and plummer 1998 draper and smith 1985 hsieh bloch and larsen 1998 maxwell 2000 thigpen 1997 wetz 1984 a more natural scenario is that we sample x y simultaneously we have to handle the test statistic 2 carefully we need its unconditional distribution which seems to be intractable at the outset an alternative to the test statistic 2 we can build a test based on the sample correlation coefficient the null and non null distributions of the test have been worked out explicitly in our consulting work many researchers prefer to use the test based on it is a choice between causality and association ryan 2013 cohen 1988 sas gatsonis and sampson 1989 krishnamoorthy and xia 2008 in our research here we will stick to 1 we use the test statistic t in 1 we determine the distribution of t under the null hypothesis 1 0 as a matter of fact we show that where and with wi s being mutually independent we use this result to obtain the critical values of the test based on t for given levels for power and sample size computations we need the distribution of t for a given value of 1 the distribution also depends on and 2 it turns out that the distribution depends only on turns out that the distribution depends only on which we can deem as the effect size the specification of facilitates computation of power in spite of all these deliberations no magic formula for power surfaces knowing the distribution of t 2 under eases the pain a little bit one might skip all this hard work by rooting for the sample correlation coefficient one could use the statistic t 1 3 for testing and power computations the null and non null distributions of t 1 have been well documented one needs to spell out the alternative value of for power computation 5 can one use the sample size that emanates from here with the test based on 1 after matching the alternative value of with the effect size is test hopping legitimate surprisingly it works this will be discussed in section 7 3 distributional results in this section we will derive the probability density function of t of 1 unconditionally the following series of steps will give the desired result 1 given x 1 x 2 xn has a normal distribution with mean and variance and and are independent 2 unconditionally 3 4 and are independent the random variable we entertain is for a given value of 1 the goal now is to get the unconditional distribution of the joint distribution of and 2 1 1 2 2 1 0 the unconditional marginal density of is given by d 2 1 2 1 1 some properties of this density are clear to observe for example the distribution is symmetric around the true value if n 2 the distribution is cauchy in addition 1 tn 1 further if n 3 unconditionally 1 and var 6 2 in the conditional set up var 3 the random variable has the probability density function 1 1 2 1 2 1 1 4 it follows that where and with and being independent 5 exact distribution of note that and are independent 6 where and and with and being independent in short t 2 7 it follows that 2 3 4 4 critical values the null hypothesis is h 0 0 and the alternative is h 1 0 test statistic test reject the null hypothesis if and only if t c where the critical value c depends on the sample size n and level of significance we denote the critical value by the null distribution of t 2 has been determined in section 3 the critical value satisfies the equation 0 0 under where and with wi s being independent explicit determination of critical values is still hard the exact distribution of t 2 helps the task via simulations the steps in the simulation work are detailed as follows 7 step 1 fix and step 2 simulate step 3 simulate step 4 simulate step 5 simulate step 6 form the ratio step 7 repeat steps 2 3 4 5 and 6 10 000 times step 8 calculate the 1 100 th percentile of the ratios step 9 calculate the positive square root of step 10 repeat step 9 1000 times step 11 calculate mean and standard deviation of step 12 record the results average sd we are not solving for the critical value using an equation the critical value is obtained via large scale simulations using the exact distribution of t 2 under the null hypothesis it is normal to expect variation in the critical value from one simulation run to another the standard deviation of the critical values emanating from step 11 will capture the extent of variation we have used r to run steps 1 through 12 the code is provided in the supplement for example when n 30 0 05 average cn 0 32634 with sd 0 00320 when n 45 0 01 average cn 0 37741 with sd 0 00473 one can also obtain the critical value via the asymptotic distribution of t if n is large t normal 0 approximately there are several ways to establish asymptotic normality of t the exact unconditional distribution of 1 is tn 1 which is asymptotically n 0 1 then use the fact that is consistent for x and that consistent for since we know the variance of t exactly we use this variance in the description of the asymptotic distribution of t the critical values following the asymptotic distribution are identified level formula 10 1 645 5 1 96 1 2 576 we have used r to run steps 1 through 12 the code is provided in the supplement in table 1 we document the average critical value cn for n 20 1 100 0 01 0 05 and 0 10 along with the critical values coming from the normal approximation the sds are not included in the table they are

size n and alternative value of 1 a power is given by power pr suppose 1 is the specified power for the required sample size we set 1 pr and solve for n we will need the distribution of when rewrite the distribution of actually the square of it is described in section 3 and it is free of the parameters of the regression model consequently the random variables and are independently distributed since and are independently distributed d with w 5 w 6 and w 5 and w 6 being independent an important fact emerges from these deliberations in that the distribution of depends only on which we can deem as the effect size in spite of all these labors the distribution of is not amenable to direct and simple computations for power calculations we have resorted to simulations we generate data from the regression model our strategy is as follows a spell out b take x 1 and 1 c for given n draw a random sample x 1 x 2 xn of size n from n 0 1 d for each 1 i n draw a random sample of size 1 from n 1 xi 1 10 e we thus have the data x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 xn yn from the model x n 0 1 and y x n 1 x 1 we are taking x 0 and 0 0 they do not play any role at all in the distributions identified they can take any values f estimate 1 x and g calculate t h check t cn with cn coming from table 1 i set up a counter 1 if t cn 0 otherwise j repeat steps a to i one thousand times k calculate power l if power matches the targeted power 1 stop otherwise keep experimenting with n until the targeted power is attained m once the sample size n is found out we wanted to make sure that this is the right number for the identified n repeat step a to l one thousand times the average power and standard deviation is also reported n tables 2 3 and 4 embody our effort under this strategy o the r code is given in

sample size at the ascertained sample size data are generated under the specifications power calculated and power averaged over thousand times e the fifth column records the standard deviation of the thousand powers calculated f we are satisfied that the sample sizes laid out are holding true 6 the route via sample correlation coefficient the test statistic t 1 built upon the sample correlation coefficient is another way to test the null hypothesis 1 0 which is equivalent to 0 the statistic t 1 tn 2 under the null hypothesis under the alternative value t 1 non central t with n 2 degrees of freedom with non centrality parameter sample size calculations are simple and direct the software r has a package pwr which facilitates sample size calculations with specifications of the level of significance power and alternative value a table of sample sizes is given in cohen 1988 here we want to explore connection between the sample sizes emanating from the test statistics t and t 1 there is a connection between the correlation coefficient and effect size 4 a graph of the relationship is presented in graph 1 15 graph 1 graph of 1 sqrt 1 1 2 we now have two sources for sample sizes in the environment of the slope parameter we will spell out the level of significance power and effect size we will record the sample size for the given effect size we will calculate the matching correlation coefficient 4 and then determine the required sample size in the next section we will contrast the sample sizes 7 contrasting sample sizes in the first table when the level is 10 we contrast sample sizes coming from two sources one based on the test using the slope parameter and effect size and the other based on the matching correlation coefficient 16 in the second table the level entertained is 5 and in the third it is 1 table 5 contrasting sample sizes slope vs correlation for 10 level slope test corrtest 80 620 622 2 90 870 861 9 95 1120 1088 32 99 1690 1584 106 80 161
