making in many areas of public interest however this data may become outdated during the intercensal period which can stretch up to several decades we developed a bayesian hierarchical model leveraging recent household surveys with probabilistic sampling designs and building footprints to produce up to date population estimates we estimated population totals and age and sex breakdowns with associated uncertainty measures within grid cells of approximately 100 m in five provinces of the democratic republic of the congo a country where the last census was completed in 1984 the model exhibited a very good fit with an value of 0 79 for out of sample predictions of population totals at the microcensus cluster level and 1 00 for age and sex proportions at the province level the results confirm the benefits of combining household surveys and building footprints for high resolution population estimation in countries with outdated censuses 2 introduction accurate population figures are essential to support decision making in many areas of public interest for instance urban planning environmental hazard risk management and public health 1 to this end the most complete and reliable data source is arguably the national population and housing census 1 2 however the data collected in the census may be incomplete due to inaccessible regions and may quickly become outdated because of migration fertility and mortality patterns occurring during the ten year intercensal period which can occasionally stretch up to several decades 3 in such circumstances the census data can be completed using different population estimation techniques 1 4 among these techniques the bottom up population modeling approach offers the advantage of producing up to date population estimates independently from the national census 3 4 bottom up models leverage population data retrieved from recent household surveys involving the complete enumeration of a representative sample of small and well defined areas named microcensus clusters 3 in their basic form these models link cluster level population totals and ancillary geospatial covariates with complete coverage of the region of interest such as settlement extents 5 6 and satellite imagery classes 7 8 to estimate population totals in unsurveyed areas these models can also include additional geospatial covariates 5 8 administrative or functional strata 5 6 and existing age and sex structures to disaggregate the population estimates within different age and sex groups 9 the united nations population fund recently highlighted the role of bottom up population models for census planning and preparation 4 in this study we extended an existing bayesian hierarchical framework for bottom up population modeling recently applied in nigeria 6 we integrated a weighted precision approach to produce unbiased estimates from household surveys with population weighted sampling designs 10 11 and modeled age and sex structures within administrative provinces using the same household survey data 12 we also accessed building footprints to provide an accurate approximation of the settled area and derive morphological and topological 3 attributes incorporated in the model both as geospatial covariates 13 14 and functional strata representing different settlement types 14 15 our model was designed to estimate population totals and age and sex breakdowns together with associated uncertainty measures within grid cells of 3 arc seconds approximately 100 m these high resolution population estimates can be flexibly aggregated within different geographic units to support specific use cases 16 we applied our bottom up population model in five provinces in the western part of the democratic republic of the congo drc in this country the last national census was completed in 1984 and existing projections are considered erratic because of the significant security economic and institutional tribulations of the past decades 17 the uncertainty around the geography and demography of the congolese population is particularly critical to decision making for public health and humanitarian interventions 17 18 our modeling effort provides up to date population estimates at high spatial resolution in five provinces of the drc while advancing the state of the art of bottom up population modeling in the use of survey data with widely adopted probabilistic sampling designs 1 2 and building footprint attributes that are in part openly available across sub saharan africa 19 results population estimates we developed a hierarchical bayesian model to estimate population totals and age and sex breakdowns at high spatial resolution in five provinces in the western part of the drc figure 1 shows the estimated population totals within grid cells of approximately 100 m for the five provincial capitals kinshasa figure 1 a has the most considerable spatial extent and the highest population totals per grid cell with large variations between the central part of the city and its outskirts the remaining cities figure 1 b e have reduced extents and lower population totals per grid cell confirming the predominantly rural character of the study region these high resolution population estimates including totals age and sex breakdowns and associated measures of model uncertainty can be accessed on a 4 dedicated web repository 20 visualized using a web mapping application 21 and integrated into data analyses through an r package 22 fig 1 estimated population totals per

total area of building footprints multiplied by the total area of building footprints within the microcensus clusters we computed population totals and densities across 926 clusters based on data collected across two rounds of household surveys and the total area of the building footprints we discarded 21 clusters exhibiting spurious population densities because 7 clusters had reduced survey coverage due to inaccessible areas and 14 clusters had no building footprints coverage figure 2 shows the geographic distribution of the observed population densities people building footprint ha

posterior probability distributions of the hierarchical intercept by settlement type and province while the distributions were generally similar across rural and urban settlements the posterior means were lower in the urban settlements of the kinshasa 6 figure 3 a and kongo central figure 3 b provinces potentially because of the higher prevalence of non residential buildings as a consequence of the limited coverage and the heterogeneous residential context the 95 credible intervals are wider in urban settlements especially in the provinces of kongo central figure 3 b kwango figure 3 c and

the hierarchical intercepts with the additive effects of three geospatial covariates derived from building footprint attribute summaries we first defined the covariate effects to be independently estimated by settlement type for each covariate eq 9 and if their posterior distribution was similar across rural and urban settlements we converted them into fixed effects eq 10 figure 4 shows the covariate effects estimated in the model we estimated random effects by settlement type for the first two covariates and a fixed effect for the third covariate while the covariate average building proximity i e the inverse of the average distance to the nearest building footprint had a 7 significant positive effect at the 95 credible level in rural settlements the effect was non significant in urban settlements conversely the covariate average building focal count i e the average count of building footprints in a focal window of approximately 2 km had a significant negative effect at the 95 credible level in rural settlements and a significant positive effect in urban settlements the covariate average building area i e the average area of the building footprints had a strong significant negative effect at the 95 level across both settlement types and was converted into a fixed effect fig 4 posterior probability distribution of the random effect by settlement type i e urban and rural

horizontal black lines show the 95 credible intervals age and sex proportions as presented in eq 11 12 we modeled age and sex proportions from the household survey data aggregated at the province level with a dirichlet multinomial process figure 5 shows the means of the posterior distribution of the age and sex proportions with relative 95 credible intervals for the five provinces age and sex

increasingly narrow for older age groups in the predominantly urban provinces of kinshasa figure 5 a and kongo central figure 5 b the pyramids had a narrower base typically associated with lower fertility the province of kinshasa also had a larger part of the population between 20 and 49 years old potentially because of work related migratory patterns the 95 credible intervals were generally narrow because of the limited differences in the aggregated province level age and sex structures which were not reflective of potential patterns occurring at the sub provincial level fig 5 means of

people building footprint ha at the microcensus cluster level and age and sex proportions at the cluster level for in sample and out of sample posterior predictions the analysis suggested a very good model fit for population totals for in sample 0 81 and out of sample 0 79 predictions despite a limited fit for population densities for in sample 0 52 and out of sample 0 47 predictions for both population totals and densities approximately 90 of the observations were within the 95 credible intervals of out of sample predictions suggesting that the uncertainty intervals were robust the analysis also indicated slight over prediction of population totals and slight under prediction of population densities at the microcensus cluster level with larger imprecision and inaccuracy for the latter province level age and sex proportions had a perfect fit for in sample 1 00 and out of sample 1 00 model predictions with imperceptible levels of imprecision and inaccuracy in both cases 100 of the observations fell within the 95 credible intervals suggesting conservative uncertainty intervals for age and sex proportions estimated at the province level however these credible intervals are unlikely to account for sub provincial differences in age and sex proportions table 1 analysis of residuals for the estimated population totals people population densities people building footprint ha

contrasts the observed population totals people and densities people building footprint ha versus in sample and out of sample posterior predictions according to settlement type the figure confirms a very good model fit for population totals which were generally in line with the observed totals the most populated microcensus clusters were located in urban settlements where 93 00 and 91 22 observations fell within the 95 credible intervals of in sample and out of sample posterior predictions the limited model fit for population densities was due to large underpredictions in densely populated clusters located in rural settlements these clusters were characterized by a reduced coverage of the building footprints which artificially increased the observed population densities where 91 58 and 90 82 observations fell within the 95 credible intervals of in sample and out of sample posterior predictions the impact of the population density outliers was partly corrected when estimating population totals because of the use of the building footprint area as a multiplicative constraint 11 fig 6 observed microcensus cluster level totals people and densities people building

modeling to leverage household survey data with different sampling designs and building footprint attributes existing techniques for population estimation demonstrated the advantages of using household surveys in terms of time and cost to fully enumerate a set of representative clusters compared with the country wide coverage of a national census 1 2 while these estimation techniques are generally endorsed for decision making 1 2 and census support 8 the resulting estimates should not be seen as a substitute replacement for the richness of information collected in the census however when the census data is incomplete or outdated bottom up modeling is an effective approach to produce 12 comprehensive and up to date population estimates at high resolution 3 4 these estimates can be flexibly aggregated within different units such as administrative boundaries catchment areas health districts or custom made polygons to support different applications 16 our modeling effort estimated population totals age and sex breakdowns at a spatial resolution of approximately 100 m together with measures of model uncertainty the model leveraged household survey data with a population weighted sampling design 23 typically adopted in national household surveys such as demographic and health surveys dhs 11 given that this type of design oversamples locations with higher population densities we included a weighted precision approach to recover unbiased estimates of population totals and densities with robust credible intervals 11 this approach is often regarded as difficult to implement 10 as we confirmed through a systematic analysis of the weights used in the population weighted sampling 24 our assessment exposed the presence of weight outliers associated with uncertainties in the population data used to compute the sampling weights that we truncated at the 90 th percentile of the statistical distribution the use of sampling weights associated with the seeds of the clusters also introduces additional uncertainty in our weighted precision approach because it does not accurately represent the probability of selection of the entire cluster we accessed building footprints to provide an accurate approximation of the settled area and derive morphological and topological attributes from building footprints to produce model covariates and define hierarchical intercepts and random effects by settlement type these attributes are in part openly available across sub saharan africa 15 19 the hierarchical intercept by settlement type and province suggested higher population densities people building footprint ha in rural than urban settlements this result was confirmed by the observed population densities at the microcensus cluster level where we discarded 14 clusters with no building footprint limited building footprint coverage was linked to outdated input imagery and other contextual factors e g forest canopy coverage affecting the 13 automatic extraction 19 in addition building footprints included non residential buildings which were likely to be more prominent in urban settlements despite the limited building footprint coverage their use as model covariates enabled us to produce meaningful inferences the covariate average building proximity had a positive effect on population densities in rural settlements suggesting a link between population density and settlement compactness the same covariate had a non significant effect in urban settlements potentially because of the complex settlement structure 14 and the higher prevalence of non residential buildings 15 the covariate average building focal counts had a positive effect on population densities in urban settlements confirming the association between population density and urban centrality 14 however we observed an opposite effect in rural settlements potentially because of higher population densities of settlements with a larger prevalence of residential buildings lastly the covariate average building area had a consistent negative effect on population densities highlighting the impact of large non residential buildings and small overcrowded buildings on population densities 15 similar to existing modeling efforts the model assumed that the population totals retrieved from the household surveys were observed without error and that no people lived outside of the area defined using the building footprints 5 6 observation error in the household surveys is likely to result in lower population totals because of inaccessible areas within the microcensus clusters additional observation error in the building footprints is expected to underestimate the population totals where the satellite imagery used for automatic extraction is outdated or obfuscated by contextual factors 19 these sources of error are likely to be systematic and could be tackled in future studies by including a measurement error component in the model 6 the model also assumed constant age and sex structures at the province level by potentially failing to capture sub provincial variations within the credibility intervals a limitation that will be addressed in future studies through a more complex hierarchical structure 12 lastly in future studies we will develop a more systematic 14 assessment of the implementation of weighted precision approaches particularly in the uncertainty associated with sampling weights 24 the proposed bottom up model advances the state of the art of bottom up population modeling in countries with outdated census data research to further develop bottom up population models is underway in the eastern part of the drc and other countries of sub saharan africa as part of the geo referenced infrastructure and demographic data for development grid 3 programme 25 these modeling efforts are tailored to the country context and the available input data although the applications of bottom up population modeling conducted as part of the grid 3 programme are primarily focused in sub saharan africa this approach has wider applicability and can support different steps of the census implementation from planning e g updating sampling frames to implementation e g support planning and logistics from quality assessment e g assess census coverage to data usage e g data anonymization 8 material and methods household surveys we accessed geolocated household surveys involving the complete enumeration of 926 microcensus clusters of approximately three settled hectares in five provinces located in the western part of the drc the data was collected across two rounds of household surveys led by the ucla drc health research and training program based at the university of california los angeles fielding school of public health and the kinshasa school of public health ksph 26 the first round of surveys was carried out in 2017 in the provinces of kinshasa kwango kwilu and mai ndombe using random sampling while the second round was carried out in 2018 in the provinces of kinshasa and kongo central using population weighted sampling 23 in both surveys seed locations i e 100 m grid cells were selected and cluster boundaries were manually delineated around these locations to include approximately three settled hectares with similar characteristics we accessed the sampling 15 weights for the second round of surveys and assessed their statistical distribution to identify outliers associated with uncertainties in the gridded population data used in the sampling 24 to limit the effects of outliers resulting from the gridded population data used in the sampling we truncated the sampling weights at the 90 th percentile of the statistical distribution we retrieved population totals for the clusters from the population counts recorded within each household and imputed population in households with a nonresponse based on the mean population per household within the same cluster we also retrieved population totals for standardized age i e under one year old five year groups from 1 to 80 and above 80 years old and sex i e male and female groups 9 within each province by aggregating individual survey records building footprints we accessed building footprints automatically extracted by ecopia ai in 2019 using satellite imagery provided by maxar technologies between 2009 and 2019 within the drc 27 morphological summary attributes based on these building footprints are openly available for the study region and throughout sub saharan africa at a resolution of approximately 100 m 19 the building footprints provided the most accurate approximation of the spatial distribution of populations across the five provinces however their coverage varies according to the year of the satellite imagery used in the feature extraction and other contextual factors e g forest canopy coverage affecting the automatic delineation 19 we used building footprints to derive morphological and topological attributes such as area perimeter number of nodes and distance to the nearest feature 9 14 15 we summarized these attributes within the survey clusters and grid cells of approximately 100 m comprising the five provinces using basic summary statistics such as the sum mean and coefficient of variation we also produced the same summary statistics for focal windows of approximately 500 m 1 km and 2 km to reflect contextual characteristics 14 we allocated the survey clusters and the grid cells to urban and rural settlements using an existing morphological classification derived from the same building footprint data 15 28 we labeled the original built up area class as urban 16 settlement and merged the original classes small settlement area i e representing rural settlements and hamlet i e isolated rural settlements into a class labeled rural settlement administrative boundaries we accessed administrative boundaries provided by the bureau central du recensement bcr the administrative body responsible for the census implementation in the drc 29 the boundaries comprised the administrative level 0 i e country level 1 i e provinces level 2 i e territories and cities and level 3 i e sectors chiefdoms and municipalities at the time of this study the administrative boundaries were being consolidated and level 3 boundaries were only available for the city of kinshasa we first derived the spatial extent of the provinces from the level 1 boundaries we then created the sub provincial regions by combining level 2 and level 3 boundaries in doing so we merged the 24 municipalities comprising the city of kinshasa into nine contiguous groups of municipalities with similar land use characteristics 14 to prevent the presence of unsurveyed sub provincial units we produced gridded datasets with a resolution of approximately 100 m with unique identifiers for each province and sub provincial region and subsequently allocated the survey clusters to a single province and a sub provincial region covariate processing and selection we constrained the extent of the clusters using the building footprints located within a radius of approximately 50 m from the surveyed households to exclude unsurveyed areas associated with accessibility constraints we derived morphological and topological attribute summaries from the building footprints and extracted additional summaries from standard gridded datasets used in the study of population distributions 30 we visually assessed scatterplots and pearson correlations between log population densities people building footprint ha and the attribute summaries across the clusters to select model covariates we retained the five covariates with the highest correlation coefficient building count count of structures average building area in ha average building perimeter in m average 17 building proximity or the inverse of the distance to the nearest building in m and average building focal count average count of building within a focal window of approximately 2 km we assessed pearson correlations between the five covariates and subsequently discarded building count and average building perimeter as strongly correlated with other covariates to avoid multicollinearity the selected covariates were finally scaled based on the mean and standard deviation computed at the grid cell level across the study area data processing and covariate selection were conducted in r version 4 0 231 using the r packages raster 32 and sf 33 population model we modeled population totals by extending an existing hierarchical bayesian modeling

model residuals for spatial autocorrelation using semivariograms and moran s i statistics we examined model fit in and out of sample using 10 fold cross validation where the model was fit ten times each time withholding a random 10 of survey clusters until all had been held out once to assess model fit for age and sex proportions we held out 10 of the clusters for each province and assessed the
