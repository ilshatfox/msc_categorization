usually happens in evacuation scenarios in e g schools hospitals or airports such situations have been discussed so far within the so called social force model sfm a particle based model with interactions depending on the relative position of the particles we suggest to enrich this model by interactions based on the velocity of the particles and some randomness both of which we introduce using the ideas of the vicsek model vm this new model allows to introduce fluctuations for a given average speed and geometry because in real life there are different evacuation modes at the same average speed and considering that the alignment interactions are modulated by an external control parameter the noise allows to introduce phase transitions between ordered and disordered states to clarify the influence of the model ingredients we have compared simulations of pedestrian motion along a corridor using a the pure vicsek model vm with two boundary conditions periodic and bouncing back and with or without desired direction of motion b the social force model sfm and c the new model developed as a combination of both sfm vm the study of steady state particle configurations in the vm with confined geometry shows the expected bands perpendicular to the motion direction while in the sfm and sfm vm particles order in stripes of a given width w along the direction of motion the results in the sfm vm case show that w t t has a diffusive like behavior at low noise dynamic exponent 1 2 while it is sub diffusive at high values of external noise 1 4 we observe the well known order disorder transition in the vm with both boundary conditions but the application of a desired direction condition inhibits the existence of disorder as expected similar behavior is observed in the sfm case for the sfm vm case we find a susceptibility maximum which increases with system size as a function of noise strength indicative of a order disorder transition in the whole range of densities 1 12 1 9 and speeds v 0 0 5 2 studied from our results we conclude that the new sfm vm model is a well suited model to describe non panic evacuation with diverse degrees of disorder i introduction collective behavior of a large number of self propelled particles spp can result in spontaneously developping ordered motion governed by changes in some control pa rameter s many groups of living beings from cells and bacteria to fish birds mammals and even humans ex hibit this specific kind of motion under particular con ditions from the point of view of statistical physics the occurrence of collective motion is a non equilibrium phase transition which has attracted much attention of the community in the last decades for more details see the reviews 1 3 the first step in the understanding of this complex behavior has been to propound simple but non trivial models such as the vicsek model vm 4 in the middle of the nineties in the vm point particles with constant speed interact with each other only by trying to align their direction of motion with their nearest neighbors with an uncertainty of this process represented by an external noise this simple rule explained in detail in section iia is enough to reproduce flocking behavior at low values of as commonly observed in nature however the complexity of collective motion often re quires to go beyond a point particle model by taking into account short and long range particle particle interac tions and interactions with the environment in particu lar it is possible to model a crowd as a system of parti cles by considering person person and person wall inter actions one of the first models of this type proposed to describe pedestrian motion was the so called social force model sfm 5 unlike the simplistic vicsek model the sfm introduces the idea of social interactions by mod eling the individual reaction to the effect of environment either other pedestrians or borders and a preferential direction of motion this model will be explained in de tail in sec ii b the main idea of our work is to analyze by using sta tistical mechanical tools the evacuation of people along a hallway in a non panic regime such as occurs in schools hospitals or airports to model this situation it is impor http arxiv org abs 1912 02232 v 1 2 tant to take into account a series of considerations such as the excluded volume and mass of human particles the interpersonal interactions that make them want to keep their own space the intent to remain away from the walls the existence of a desired direction of motion but also the idea of being influenced by the motion of nearest neighbors keeping this in mind we propose in the present work a new approach by introducing a model a combination of the standard vm and sfm which takes into account the particle interactions as in the sfm and additionally a vicsek like alignment modulated by a noise we call this the sfm vm model and it will be described in detail in sec ii c in order to identify the influence of the different parts of the model we have compared the vm the sfm vm and the sfm in the stationary configuration of n par ticles moving through a corridor like system in a normal evacuation situation slow speed regime we have stud ied all models under the same external conditions num ber of particles n system size lx ly particle speed v 0 external noise etc in particular we have analyzed the vm under different boundary conditions with the purpose of introducing the effect of walls into the vm and the idea of a desired direction of motion such as it is defined in the sfm in order to flesh out the com parison between models and we have studied the effect of these variations on the order disorder phase transition finally it is worth mentioning that even though the sfm has been widely studied see for example 6 7 and ref erences therein the statistical physics issues related to phase transitions of social models have been less exten sively studied see e g 8 9 the paper is organized as follows after this introduc tion a detailed description of the models can be found in section ii the simulation details are presented in section iii and results are analyzed and discussed in section iv finally a summary and our conclusions are developed in section v ii models a vicsek model vm the vicsek model 4 describes the dynamics ofn spp characterized at time t by their position ri t and velocity vi t i 1 n and in its simplest version all parti cles are considered to have the same speed v 0 vi v 0 at each time step particle i assumes the average direc tion of motion of its neighbors within an interaction cir cle of radius r 0 distorted by the existence of an external noise of amplitude 0 1 the simple update rules in the 2 d case are given by i t t t r 0 i t 1 vi t t v 0 cos i t t sin i t t 2 ri t t ri t t vi t t 3 where t r 0 is the average of the direction of motion of all the nearest neighbors of the i th particle whose distance rj ri r 0 and i t is a scalar noise uni formly distributed in the range the update rules given by eqs 1 and 3 are known in the literature as an gular noise 4 and forward update 10 respectively by choosing t 1 as the time unit and r 0 1 as the length unit the only control parameters of the model are the noise amplitude the speed v 0 and the density of particles n v where v lx ly is the volume of the 2 d system these simple rules are enough to reproduce a funda mental aspect of collective behavior the existence of a phase transition between a disordered state and an or dered phase where the direction of motion is the same for all particles as the noise intensity decreases the average velocity of the system defined as 1 nv 0 n i 1 vi 4 is the appropriate order parameter to describe this phase transition 2 4 in the disordered phase 0 while 1 for the ordered phase a critical line c v 0 separates the disordered from the ordered states in order to ensure the independence from initial conditions has to be averaged over time after it reaches a stationary regime this value is called stat the order of this phase transition is still a matter of controversy 10 11 until now the consensus seems to indicate that depending on how the noise is applied angular noise or vectorial noise the transition can be continuous or first order like respectively for more details see 2 b the social force model contemporary to the vm the social force model sfm was proposed by helbing and molnar 5 12 to describe the behavior of pedestrians since then the sfm has been widely studied and applied for different situations see for example 6 13 14 the sfm determines the direction of motion for each particle by taking into account three interactions the desire force the social force and the granular force which are defined as 1 the desire force fdi represents the desire of spp to march in a given direction if we are mod eling the evacuation of a crowd the target of the desire will be the exit this force involves the idea of a desired speed of motion vd and it is given by fdi mi vde t vi rt 5 where mi is the particle mass vi is the current velocity e t the unit vector pointing to the target 3 direction and rt is the relaxation time of the par ticle velocity towards vd in the present work the desired speed has been taken as equal to the vicsek particle speed vd v 0 2 the social force fsi takes into account the fact that people like to move without bodily contact with other individuals the private space wish is represented as a long range repulsive force based on the distance rij ri rj between the center of mass of the individual i and its neighbor j the complete expression is the following fsi n j 6 i a exp d rij b n ij 6 where the constants ai and bi define the strength and range of the social force n ij is the normalized vector pointing from pedestrian j to i and d is the pedestrian diameter when one considers identical particle sizes 3 the granular force fgi is considered when the pedestrians are in contact each other it is a repul sive force inspired by granular interactions includes compression and friction terms and is expressed as fgi k n ij v t ji t ij g d rij 7 where g d rij is zero when d rij and d rij otherwise the first term represents a compressive force its strength given by the constant k which acts in the n ij direction the second term in eq 7 related to friction acts in the tangential direc tion t ij orthogonal to n ij and it depends on the difference vtji vj vi t ij multiplied by the constant the interaction pedestrian wall is defined analogously by means of social fswi and granular forces fgwi if riw denotes the distance between the i pedestrian and the wall and n iw is the wall normal pointing to the particle the social force is defined as fsiw a exp d 2 riw b n iw 8 similarly denominating t iw as the direction tangential orthogonal to n iw the granular force is expressed as fgwi k n iw v i t iw t iw g r riw 9 for the force constants in the interactions between the particles and the walls we choose the same values as for the interparticle forces by considering all the forces described above the equa tion of motion for pedestrian i of mass mi is given by mi dvi dt fdi fsi fswi fgi fgwi 10 c the combined model sfm vm realistic evacuations in a non panic situation have different behavior depending on geometry and average speed however and even in the case of similar bound ary conditions it is expected that one observes differ ences between evacuations in a school hospital or air port an important factor here is the existence of intrin sic fluctuations in the moving interacting particles such as children passengers or patients we propose to intro duce these fluctuations including in the standard sfm the external noise parameter as in the vicsek model the central idea is to take into account not only the social interactions described above but the influ ence of nearest neighbors in the vicsek style and to in clude noise as an external parameter which modu lates this interaction we will refer to this new model as sfm vm in this way in the sfm vm the velocity of particle i is given by vi t t v 0 vv mi t t dvi dt t t vvmi t t dvi dt t t 11 here vv mi t t is the velocity of particle i given by eq 2 iii simulation details as was previously mentioned we are going to compare all models under equal external conditions an important point here is to match all relevant physical units in the models since r 0 and t are common variables we can extend their role as time and length units from the vm to all models studied in order to match the simulations to real systems we have assumed that one length unit r 0 is equivalent to one meter in si and one second corresponds to one time step t after this assumption it is possible to define the mass and force variables in eq 10 as kilograms and newtons respectively as the sfm requires monte carlo simulations were performed in a system of n 300 self propelled particles moving in corridor of size lx ly with lx 600 and ly 2 5 6 periodic boundary conditions were applied in the horizontal di rection at lx so that circulation of particles occurred in a loop a size of lx 600 was then chosen to make sure that the fastest particles do not meet the stragglers to correlate pedestrians with particles in the case of sfm vm we have considered particles with d 0 7 in units of r 0 and 80 kg of mass the characteristic pa rameters of sfm interactions eqs 5 7 have been taken from previous works 5 15 specifically a 2000 n b 0 08 m k 1 2 105 kg s 2 and 2 4 105 kg m s these values correspond to a typical crowd in every case studied several tests have been per formed to assure the reliability of the data that are not shown here for the sake of space we made sure that 4 starting from different initial conditions of particle distri bution in position and direction of motion t reached the same value in the stationary regime stat also the run to run fluctuations in the t profile were not drastic to determine the number of reasonable runs for the simulations a first study was made observing how the average value of stat and its uncertainty varied ac cording to how many runs were taken in the average as a conclusion we considered 50 runs for each set of simulation parameters as was mentioned the vm is a simple model that does not take into account short range interactions such as excluded volume or friction between particles and with walls moreover taking into account that the aim of this work is to analyze the collective motion of individ uals moving through a corridor we introduce a series of variations on the vm on the one hand we relaxed the standard periodic boundary conditions pbc to a bouncing back condition bbc in the y direction in this way we simulate impenetrable walls at y 0 and y ly where particles rebound without losing energy on the other hand we have introduced a desired direction dd of motion in such away that the direction of motion at time t 1 given by eq 1 is modified by the addition of a desired angle des as i t t i t t des 2 12 with des 0 in our case indicating that particles prefer to move to the end of the corridor this variation of the vm allows to introduce the existence of a preferred direction of motion in the same sense as it is introduced in the sfm finally particles were inserted randomly in the first 0 5 lx of the corridor with the intention to move to wards the end of the corridor the speed was considered in the range v 0 0 5 2 m s consistent with normal evacuations in schools hospitals cinemas etc for this reason we have explored the range of ly 2 5 6 m in order to represent the typical widths of corridors iv results and discussion a full set of simulations was performed by taking into account the considerations mentioned above in figure 1 we show several snapshots of stationary configurations in the ordered phase for all models with the same ex ternal parameters 0 05 and v 0 0 5 and different boundary conditions as can be seen in the vm figure 1 a c stationary ordered states correspond to the existence of bands per pendicular to the direction of motion this fact has been widely studied and reported in the literature see 2 3 and reference therein however it is worth to mention that different boundary conditions seem to af fect the local order

fig 4 pbc in figure 1 a in comparison with bbbc in fig ure 1 b following with the qualitative analysis of the vm cases the most ordered configuration corresponds to the vm bbbc dd as it is expected here the in corporation of a preferential direction of motion can be interpreted as an external field applied in the system pro moting order on the other hand in both sfm vm at low noise figure 1 d and sfm figure 1 e particles are ordered in a horizontal cluster configuration trying to keep a distance between each other and with the walls the similarity in behavior observed in snapshot config urations between low noise sfm vm figure 1 d and sfm figure 1 e is broken when the noise increases this is explicitly observed in figure 2 where as it is expected disorder increases with noise to appreciate in detail the influence of vicsek interac tions on the spatial configuration in the sfm we have studied the evolution of particle clusters for several noise strengths for this purpose we define the density profile in the x direction as p x t number of particles between x and x x n 13 and consequently p x t can be interpreted as a his togram with bins of width x in our case we have fixed x 5 d 0 7 so that we have the chance to find many particles in the bin the size of the bin is such that it is not too small to allow the cluster to be described as continuous no empty bins in the middle but also not so large that it cannot be appreciated how 5 0 1 2 3 4 5 l y 2 4 l y 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 l x 2 4 l y 2 4 l y 0 0 5 1 sfm fig 2 comparison of the stationary state configurations for both sfm and sfm vm for different external noise values as indicated the snapshots correspond to n 300 lx 600 ly 4 5 1 9 and v 0 0 5 the size changes over time in this way the width of the density profile at time t w t can be defined as the distance between the max imum and the minimum values of x for which p x t 1 n properly normalized by considering the pbc ap plied in the x direction with this idea w t is directly associated with the extension of the cluster of particles as a function of time the obtained results show that at low noise the station ary cluster keeps its form and w t is constant in time on the other hand when the noise increases particles spread and therefore the cluster width grows with time this effect is most relevant for 0 5 the dynamic dependence of w t figure 3 b suggest a power law behavior of the form w t t 14 where has a strong dependence on noise in fact a least squares fit of the data gives 0 for 0 and the sfm 0 52 4 1 2 for 0 5 and 0 27 1 for 1 the behavior observed for 0 5 is compati ble with a diffusive like spread of the particle front with the typical einstein exponent 1 2 for higher noise it seems that the competition between random movement given by the noise and social force interactions gives as a result a sub diffusive behavior with 1 4 the behavior observed for 1 is reminiscent of the freez ing by heating effect observed in the sfm in the panic regime 16 17 in this case the existence of increasing fluctuations in the system or nervousness of pedestrians produces a blocking effect and even when they are in a disordered state particles can not move in the desired direction of motion let us now turn to the question of an underlying non equilibrium phase transition in the different models as a function of the noise strength by evaluating the station ary state stat and its variance var 2 2 0 100 200 300 400 500 l x 0 0 1 0 2 p x t t 3 t 300 t 3000 10 1 10 2 10 3 time mcs 10 2 w t sfm vm 0 sfm vm 0 5 sfm

lattice size lx ly 600 4 5 can be observed in figure 4 as a first comment it should be noticed that the application of bbbc seems to move the vm transition maximum var in fig 4 b to higher values of in comparison with pbc this is in agreement with the snapshots of figure 1 a b at a given noise c the pbc case is more disordered than the bbbc one even when in both cases the stripe geometry confines particle movement the existence of impenetrable walls in the bbbc increases significantly the confinement effects and therefore it is expected that vm alignment should be more relevant than for pbc 0

with both pbc and bbbc vm dd prevents the existence of a disordered phase as it is expected this appears reflected in the fact that stat 9 0 and var is maximal when 1 in the case of the sfm vm the presence of an exter nal noise clearly modifies the behavior of motion in com parison with sfm in a non panic regime in a corridor when trivially one expects stat 1 because in the sfm vm repulsive interactions between particles make the formation of a condensed cluster more difficult it is observed that v m ddstat sfm v m stat for every the existence of a maximum in var fig 4 b suggests to analyze the dependence of this behavior on external noise upon a variation of speed v 0 and system size lx ly to check the reliability of the sfm vm outcomes we have performed the same analysis in vm cases where the var maximum is related to the existence of a phase transition our results are shown in fig 5 as can be seen in the vm fig 5 a b the peak of the susceptibility defined as var lxly becomes narrower and higher as both n and system size are increased this behavior is not observed in the case of vm dd fig 5 c as ex pected in the case of the sfm vm the rounded peak of var lxly as a function of increases in height as n and the system size grow however it sharpens only very slowly this is indicative of an underlying phase transition but to clearly establish its existence it would be necessary to study much larger system sizes at fixed density than is possible within the scope of the present work however it is noteworthy that although the effect of external noise in the model is less important than in the vm it seems enough to break the symmetry imposed by sfm interactions 0 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 0 100 200 300 400 500 v ar l x l y 0 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 0 100 200 300 400 500 v ar

because in these plots we are keeping n and lx fixed the vertical axis ly is an indirect representation of the density from these plots it can be appreciated that although the previous analysis was presented for a given value of and v 0 sim ilar behavior is observed for 1 12 1 5 and v 0 0 5 2 fig 7 in this way our conclusions can be extended to a wide range of densities and speeds within the non panic regime v summary and conclusions we have studied the role of interactions in the behav ior of pedestrians moving in a corridor like system for this purpose we have introduced a new model that we have called sfm vm as a combination of both the well known vicsek and social force models to check its per formance we have started our analysis with the vicsek model in a confined geometry with different boundary conditions applied in particular we have studied the effects of bouncing back boundary conditions that repro duce the effects of walls and the existence of a desired direction of motion the end of the corridor we have compared these results to those obtained with the sfm and the new sfm vm in the first place particle configurations in the ordered steady state are qualitatively different between the mod 7 fig 7 color online level plots of stat for n 300 lx 600 as a function of noise x axis left pannel for different densities ly variable and lx fixed for fixed speed v 0 0 5 right pannel for different speed v 0 and at fixed ly 4 5 1 9 els analyzed while in the vm particles move in a more or less compact band perpendicular to the direction of motion in the sfm and the sfm vm particles exhibit some horizontal stripes parallel to the direction of mo tion this effect is a consequence of the repulsive inter actions between particles and with the walls present in those two models figures 1 and 2 in order to compare both sfm and sfm vm we have analyzed the density profiles in the direction of motion x and determined its width as a function of time our results indicate that the width in the sfm vm case has a power law behav ior with a dynamical exponent which depends on the external noise in particular we have determined that 1 2 at 0 5 and 1 4 at 1 figure 3 we have associated this change from an expected diffusive like to a sub diffusive behavior to the competition be tween vm like interactions and social interactions at high noise fluctuations have a freezing by heating effect that has been reported only in the panic regime before 16 17 in our case this effect appears in the system even at low speed values as a consequence of the intro duction of the external noise in the second place we have analyzed the order pa rameter defined as the average velocity of the system and its variance as function of external noise for the di verse models described above figures 4 5 in the vm the application of different boundary conditions peri odic and bouncing back moves the critical value of the order disorder phase transition to higher values of in contrast the existence of a desired direction of motion in the vm promotes the order even at high values of exter nal noise annihilating the phase transition as expected in the sfm vm the existence of an external noise that modulates the vicsek like interactions brakes the sfm symmetry figure 6 as a consequence both the order parameter and its variance are sensitive to this effect finally we consider it important to remark that these outcomes can be observed in the whole range of densi ties 1 12 1 9 and speeds v 0 0 5 2 studied which en compass reasonable values of evacuations in a non panic regime figure 7 based on these results we can conclude that the sfm vm is a successful model to describe the pedes trian motion along a corridor in a non panic regime this new model allows us to elucidate the role of the compe tition between social and alignment interactions charac teristics of the sfm and the vm respectively in the sfm vm alignment interactions are tuned by the ex ternal noise same as for the vm and this allows us to address questions on the existence of a non equilibrium order disorder transition controlled by this parameter our results are qualitatively compatible with the exis tence of such a transition however the approach to the thermodynamic limit seems to be very slow putting a final quantitative conclusion beyond the scope of this work acknowledgments
