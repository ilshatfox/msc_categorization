new exploratory tools for extremal dependence networks and annual extremal networks whitney k huang daniel s cooley imme ebert uphoff chen chen snigdhansu chatterjee january 25 2019 abstract understanding dependence structure among extreme values plays an important role in risk assessment in environmental studies in this work we propose the network and the annual extremal network for exploring the extremal dependence structure of environmental processes a network is constructed by connecting pairs whose estimated upper tail dependence coefficient exceeds a prescribed threshold we develop an initial network estimator and we use a spatial block bootstrap to assess both the bias and variance of our estimator we then develop a method to correct the bias of the initial estimator by incorporating the spatial structure in in addition to the network which assesses spatial extremal dependence over an extended period of time we further introduce an annual extremal network to explore the year to year temporal variation of extremal connections we illustrate the and the annual extremal networks by analyzing the hurricane season maximum precipitation at the us gulf coast and surrounding area analysis suggests there exists long distance extremal dependence for precipitation extremes in the study region and the strength of the extremal dependence may depend on some regional scale meteorological conditions for example sea surface temperature 1 introduction the 2017 hurricane season was the costliest tropical cyclone season on record halverson 2018 the season had 17 named

three storms were distinct both in location and timing harvey impacted texas and louisiana in mid to late august irma impacted florida in early september and maria devastated puerto rico in late september a standard treatment of the data from these three storms would likely treat them as independent events due to their temporal and spatial distance however it is largely acknowledged that these storms are related arising from conditions in 2017 conducive to tropical cyclone formation and intensification emanuel 2011 trenberth et al 2018 while it is important to assess local impacts of each storm understanding the connection of hurricane induced extreme precipitation is also important for insurance companies or government agencies e g federal emergency management agency fema who need to prepare for the possibility of responding to multiple extreme events in a year thus we seek to use an approach that studies such phenomena in context of each other specifically using a spatial network type approach the concept of networks has been used in climate science for about 15 years the connection was first established by tsonis and roebber tsonis and roebber 2004 tsonis et al 2006 who introduced the concept of climate networks to study the dynamics of earth s climate system a climate network consists of nodes e g grid cells from a climate model output gridded reanalysis data product and edges two nodes are connected by an edge if the strength of a pair wise dependence measure between the corresponding pairs of time series is strong enough for example tsonis and roebber 2004 connected nodes with correlation greater than 0 5 this approach has been applied to many climate applications e g tsonis et al 2006 2008 donges et al 2009 steinhaeuser et al 2011 to gain insights into the dynamics of the climate system over many spatial scales e g teleconnection paths other important network types in climate science are event synchronization networks quiroga et al 2002 malik et al 2010 2012 boers et al 2014 where connections are defined based on whether extreme events at one point commonly coincide within the span of a selected time interval with extreme events at another point phase synchro 2 nization networks yamasaki et al 2009 where the signals at each point are viewed as oscillations and connections are defined based on the apparent coupling between those oscillations and causal networks runge 2014 ebert uphoff and deng 2014 zerenner et al 2014 kretschmer et al 2016 where connections are defined to represent potential cause effect relationships causal networks can be established by many different methods for example they can be based on probabilistic graphical models pearl 2000 spirtes et al 2000 for their use in climate science see for example ebert uphoff and deng 2014 on combining the concept of granger causality with vector autoregression var l tkepohl 2007 or lasso tibshirani 1996 methods as known as graphical lasso or glasso yuan and lin 2007 friedman et al 2008 for their use in climate science see for example bahadori and liu 2011 or on gaussian models zerenner et al 2014 note that the majority of these network types are closely related to the concept of cor relation namely correlation networks use correlation itself tsonis and roebber 2004 many probabilistic graphical models are derived using partial correlation ebert uphoff and deng 2014 var and glasso approaches approximate regression coefficients which can be expressed in terms of partial correlation and gaussian models approximate the precision matrix i e inverse covariance matrix whose elements can be interpreted as partial correlation coefficients only two network types mentioned above are not based on correlation namely phase synchronization networks which with their assumption of oscillators do not appear to be a good match to model extremes and event synchroniza tion networks which are in fact most closely related to the concepts discussed here but are not based on well understood statistical measures correlation measures the linear relationship between a bivariate random vector around the center of its distribution and hence is poorly suited for describing dependence in the tail i e the dependence between extreme events in contrast several dependence measures designed specifically for extremes have been proposed in the literature and those are likely to be more appropriate than correlation to construct networks that focus on analyzing relationships between extremes three examples are the upper tail dependence 3 aka tail dependence coefficient coles et al 1999 the extremal coefficient smith 1990 schlather and tawn 2003 and the f madogram cooley et al 2006 naveau et al 2009 see chapter 2 of yan and dey 2015 for a review the upper tail dependence is defined as lim u 1 u lim u 1 p f 2 x 2 u f 1 x 1 u 1 where x 1 and x 2 are two random variables and f 1 f 2 their corresponding cumulative dis tribution function cdf thus the measure is the limiting conditional probability of one random variable being extreme given that the other random variable is extreme note that the measure is symmetric in terms of which variable is chosen to be conditioned upon due to the standardization of the marginal cdfs in section 2 we introduce a new network type the network where we use the aforementioned upper tail dependence to explore the spatial dependence structure in extremes we briefly proposed this idea at a workshop ebert uphoff et al 2018 but it is fully developed for the first time here specifically we construct a network by connecting the pairs of nodes whose s exceed some specified value see sec 2 1 for details however we find that a straight forward implementation of this procedure does not perform well as it introduces many spurious network connections see sec 2 2 this problem which can be described as a network bias is not unique to networks in fact we found that the same bias can occur in traditional correlation networks as well although to the best of our knowledge this issue has never been discussed for correlation networks in sec 2 3 we describe a method to alleviate this issue by incorporating the spatial structure on observed from the empirical estimates to reconstruct the network although we did not test this hypothesis yet we conjecture that this bias correction method could be used to correct the bias in correlation networks as well the network assesses extremal dependence integrated over time which is useful for assessing risk however as such it cannot be used to explore the dynamics i e year to year structure of extreme events in order to gain insights about the potential mechanisms that contribute to extreme behavior such as the 2017 hurricane season in section 2 4 4 we develop another network type the annual extremal network that aims to explore the potential drivers of extreme behavior in section 3 we create a network to hurricane season maximum daily precipitation data collected in the us gulf coast to explore the spatial pattern of the extremal network connections we also apply the annual extremal network to this precipitation data and examine whether sea surface temperature affects characteristics of the annual networks it should be noted that the purpose of the new network types proposed here is not to replace existing network types such as correlation networks or event synchronization networks but to supplement them namely for any given application one might construct both a correlation network which is more sensitive to identifying dependencies near the mean of the distribution and a network which is more sensitive to identifying depen dencies between extremes the two different networks are thus expected to provide two complementary viewpoints of the spatial dependencies however comparing these types of networks is not trivial so is subject of future research and here we simply focus on presenting the new type of network 2 and annual extremal networks in this section we first describe how to construct a network but also in tandem describe an illustrative simulation study our reason for interweaving these two discussions is that the simulation study exposes a bias issue with the network that arises due to the act of thresholding at a level of and creating edges for pairs of nodes whose estimated exceeds this threshold we will begin by introducing the needed background in order to describe the procedure for estimating for each pair of nodes locations in section 2 1 we then present a simulation study to illustrate the issue of network bias sec 2 2 which we then correct by conducting a spatial regularization on sec 2 3 we conclude the section by describing the annual extremal networks sec 2 4 5 2 1 an empirical estimator of we first discuss how we estimate from observations of a random sample of a bivariate random vector to develop an estimator for one would need to first estimate the marginal distributions second since is the limiting conditional probability one would need to choose a threshold u 0 1 to estimate there is a bias variance trade off to be made in the choice of u using a u that is not sufficiently high results in increased bias while using a u that is too high results in increased variance due to paucity of data in practice often u is estimated for many values of u and plotted see for example the chiplot function of the evd package stephenson 2002 for r r core team 2018 our particular application with an additional assumption of max stability allows us to avoid the selection of u our motivation here is to better understand relationships between hurricane events in a given year which leads us to investigate annual extremes to make this precise let zt z 1 t z 2 t t maxb ti t 1 b 1 y 1 i max b t i t 1 b 1 y 2 i t t 1 m n b where yi y 1 i y 2 i t i 1 n be the original observations with sample size n b be the block size and m n b be the sample size for the block maximum for example yi ni 1 could denote the daily rainfall amounts at two locations and i the time index e g starting from january 1 st for some year if we use b 365 or 366 for leap years then zt would be the annual maximum precipitation amounts at these two locations in year t where their dependence is of interest for risk assessment below we use estimators of extremal dependence that have been proposed for the max stable setting to obtain our estimator for max stability is an important notion that underlies much of extreme value analysis and here we give a brief introduction the reader is referred to coles et al 2001 beirlant et al 2004 de haan and ferreira 2006 segers 2012 for more details a multivariate distribution z rd is max stable if the distribu tion is close under component wise maximization that is each marginal distribution by extremal types theorem fisher and tippett 1928 gnedenko 1943 is belongs to the family of generalized extreme value gev jenkinson 1955 coles et al 2001 fur thermore the dependence structure which can be described by its copula c joe 1997 6 nelsen 2007 is satisfied the property that c u 1 n 1 u 1 n d n c u 1 ud for all n 0 the copula c is called max stable copula which form the basis for much of multi variate and spatial extreme value analysis davison et al 2012 ribatet and sedki 2013 the implication of max stability is that any pairwise for a max stable random vector is a constant with respect to u and hence there is no need to choose a threshold moreover there exists deterministic relationships between and the other aforementioned summary statistics for extremal dependence namely and under the max stable condition we will make use of these relationships to develop our estimator for in the next paragraph we first estimate the marginal distributions of z 1 and z 2 denoted as g 1 g 2 non parametrically by their empirical distribution functions edfs g 1 g 2 we then estimate the f madogram the first order absolute difference in cdf 1 2 e g 1 z 1 g 2 z 2 2 using the following empirical estimator 1 2 1 m m t 1 g 1 z 1 t g 2 z 2 t 3 cooley et al 2006 has shown that there is a one to one correspondence between and 1 2 1 2 4 furthermore by the max stability assumption we have 2 therefore we use the plug in estimate 1 2 1 2 to obtain the resulting estimator of 2 1 2 1 2 5 to create a network we first apply this estimator to all the pairwise compo nents i j of a d dimensional random vector z we then connect those pairs with ij j 1 d i 1 d i 6 j greater than a chosen threshold min to construct the corresponding 7 network 2 2 simulation study the purpose of this simulation study is to examine the performance of the empirical estimator introduced in the previous section for estimating the network where the network consists of pairs with greater than some pre specified threshold to do that we will need to generate data from a random vector for which we know the true network for a given threshold the estimated network can then be compared with the true network for evaluation this simulated network thus serves as a benchmark for the proposed new network estimation procedure to make this simulation relevant in the context of environmental applications we first simulate 100 spatial locations uniformly in a 0 1 0 1 domain and these are the nodes of the network we then generate realizations from a stationary and isotropic brown resnick process brown and resnick 1977 kabluchko et al 2009 at these locations a brown resnick process is a flexible class of stationary max stable processes where every finite collection of those random variables has a multivariate max stable distribution the dependence structure of a brown resnick process is induced by a gaussian process via the spectral representation of max stable process de haan 1984 the interested reader is referred to kabluchko et al 2009 huser and davison 2013 thibaud et al 2016 for more details the implied value of a brown resnick process for each pair i j only depends on their spatial distance denoted by hij and the gaussian process parameters the range and the smoothness h 2 2 h 2 where is the cdf of the standard normal distribution setting 0 05 1 and min 0 3 two nodes will be connected if their distance is less than 0 107 a relatively small distance compare with the spatial domain in our simulation study we simulate 100 realizations the monte carlo sample size each with sample sizem 50 and dimension d 100 i e a brown resnick process observed at the aforementioned 100 spatial locations for each realization in the simulation study we estimate the 8 network with min 0 3 using the empirical estimator described in sec 2 1 comparing the estimated networks and the true network it is apparent that the number of edges is overestimated see fig 1 a b and c we further evaluate the estimation performance in terms of the true positive rate tpr and positive predictive value ppv defined as tpr i j ij 0 3 and ij 0 3 i j ij 0 3 6 ppv i j ij 0 3 and ij 0 3 i j ij 0 3 7 while tpr is reasonably high 80 the estimation procedure identifies many more false positives than true positives as the ppv is rather low 35 see fig 1 d 0 0 0 4 0 8 0 0 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 0 a true 0 0 0 4 0 8 0 0 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 0 b best f re q u e n cy 200 400 600 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 c edges 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 0 d tpr ppv figure 1 a

connections arises plotted is the true as a function of spatial distance along with one simulation s estimates although the estimates themselves appear unbiased as they center around the true values it is the act of thresholding which introduces the bias clearly there are more false positives than false negatives due to the shape of the true function and the increasing variance of the estimates as decreases note that this problem is not unique to the networks proposed here in fact we confirmed in another simulation that the same effect can also occur for the well established correlation networks although to the 9 best of our knowledge this issue has never been mentioned in the literature on climate networks 0 0 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 0 1 2 0 5 0 0 0 5 1 0 distance tp tnfn fp figure 2 ij

network bias correction here we develop a method to correct the bias of the network estimation as demonstrated in the previous subsection we exploit the spatial structure revealed from ij see fig 2 to spatially regularize the network estimate in what follows we will describe a new estimator for ij denoted by ij which is a weighted average of empirical estimator ij and an estimator that explicitly incorporates spatial information hij the weight for a given pair i j denoted as ij will depend on the estimation precision of ij and hij the resulting estimator the weighted average of ij and hij has an empirical bayes interpretation see loader and switzer 1992 in the context of spatial covariance function estimation can then be used to construct the network specifically the bias corrected estimator has the following form ij ij ij 1 ij hij i j 1 d 8 10 in the following we first describe how to estimate hij and then discuss how to come up with the weights ij 2 3 1 the estimator for h we smooth the ij the empirical estimates for all the pairs by spatial distance to obtain h specifically we divide ij into k distance bins and we compute the mean value of ij within each bin denoted by k we then fit a cubic smoothing spline regression wahba 1990 gu 2013 to hk k kk 1 where h k denotes the average distance within the kth bin using the sreg function in the fields r package nychka et al 2015 to get the h as a function of spatial distance only note that this approach effectively introduced a spatially stationary and isotropic structure on which is less tenable especially when h is large therefore we assume for any h 0 h is normally distributed with variance 2 h increases with spatial distance in order to weaken this somewhat strong and rigid assumption in order to learn potential nonstationary pattern on 2 3 2 the weights ij the weight ij for a given pair i j is determined by the estimation variability of ij 2 ij and the amount of departure from h quantified by a variance function 2 h we perform a spatial block bootstrap see e g wang et al 2016 appendix c or huang et al 2016 appendix d by re sampling the vectors zt mt 1 to obtain the bootstrap variances 2 ij as the estimates for the corresponding 2 ij we then use 2 ij 2 ij 2 ij as the weight ij the estimator 8 can be formulated as the posterior mean from the hierarchical model ij n ij 2 ij 9 ij hij ij 10 ij n 0 2 hij 11 11 ij can be interpreted as an empirical bayes robbins 1955 efron and morris 1972 casella 1985 estimator where the empirical aspect arises from the fact that we estimate h from ij 2 3 3 an illustration following the bias correction procedure described in previous subsections we first bin the ij into k 100 bins to obtain k 100 k 1 we then fit a cubic spline regression to hk k 100 k 1 to get the estimate of h see fig 3 a we then assume 2 h 0 095 1 exp 6 h 0 72 which is an increasing logistic function with h as described in previous subsection the bootstrap standard deviations are used as the es timates of ij and we compare those estimates with the oracle standard errors i e standard deviations sds among those 100 monte carlo simulations from the true model as would be expected the bootstrap sds are slightly higher than their corresponding oracle sds but they show similar behavior at least qualitatively we can then plug in the 2 ij hij and 2 hij to obtain the resulting estimate ij for each pair to construct the bias corrected network this estimator performs well as ij have been shrunk toward hij which is much closer to the truth than ij fig 3 c 0 0 0 4 0 8 1 2 0 4 0

bootstrap standard errors are slightly higher than the true standard errors c as in fig 2 but we add the bias corrected estimates ij blue points the comparison of tpr ppv for the empirical and the bias corrected network 12 estimators shows that our method not only identifies most of the true connections i e tpr 1 but also avoids making many false discoveries i e ppv for the bias corrected

modifications is expected to apply also to correlation networks to compensate for their network bias but that topic is beyond the scope of this work 2 4 annual extremal network the estimation procedure of the network and its bias corrected version assumes that the dependence structure of the block maximum zt does not change with time i e zt t 1 m is a random sample from an underlying time invariant random vector z so that one can use these replicates to infer the spatial extremal dependence moreover we assume that z is max stable to avoid the need to choose a high threshold u to estimate here we introduce another type of network the annual extremal network to examine the year to year variation of the observed extremal networks and we seek to explain this variability the main idea of the annual extremal network is to connect a pair of nodes in a given year t if extreme events occur at both locations for example an extreme event can be defined as the value exceeding a high percentile say the 95 th percentile in this case two locations are connected if both locations exceed their 20 year return level in a given year specifically we treat the edfs of zt denoted by ut where 13 ut u 1 t u 2 t ud t t as the data and for each t 1 m we connect pairs i j if both ui t and uj t are greater than 0 95 the definition of the annual extremal network defined here has similaraties to the definition of event synchronization networks malik et al 2010 2012 boers et al 2014 but the latter operate on a completely different time scale event synchronization net works in climate science typically consider daily data and define extreme events at each location to be those exceeding a certain threshold e g the 95 th percentile of the overall distribution two locations are connected if an extreme event at one location is frequently followed by an extreme event at another location within a matter of days which can be used to track the propagation of individual phenomena from one location to another e g the propagation of storm systems in contrast the annual extremal network due to its annual scale investigates whether the overall conditions in a given year lead to several events in the same year although those events may not have any direct connection to each other thus due to the different time scale days vs years these two network types focus on very different phenomena summary statistics e g the number of the connections the average distance of con nections at each location of this annual network are time series on an annual scale and can be related to some physically meaningful covariates to explore its year to year variation in section 3 3 we use the number of long distance connected pairs to re late this statistic to sea surface temperature note that the annual extremal network described here is constructed directly from the data namely the edfs for all the loca tions whereas the network is constructed from the statistic that was estimated from the edfs therefore by ignoring the estimation uncertainty of edfs themselves we do not need to develop a bias correction procedure as we did for the network 14 3 gulf coast extreme precipitation application 3 1 data set we use a subset of the global historical climatology network ghcn data set menne et al 2012 where the spatial domain includes texas louisiana mississippi alabama florida and georgia and the time period is from jan 1949 to oct 2017 there are 339 ghcn stations being included in this study where the selecting criterion is that those stations should have at least 90 percentage of non missing daily precipitation values we further restrict our attention to the annual maximum of the daily precipitation values from june to october to investigate the extremal dependence structure for the hurricane season 3 2 network for gulf coast extreme precipitation we first compute the network based on the empirical estimator as described in sec 2 1 and we assess the network estimation uncertainty using a spatial block bootstrap the results obtained from the block bootstrap fig 4 left panel clearly demonstrate the issue of overestimation we then conduct a bias correction using the method described in sec 2 3 the right panel in fig 4 displays the ij h and ij as a function of the spatial distance edges f re q u e n cy 2000 4000 6000 8000 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 0 500

connections of the original sample right ij gray points h blue curve and ij black curve of the gulf coast hurricane season maximum precipitation 15 fig 5 shows that many long distance links in the network based on the empirical es timator disappear and may simply be due to estimation variability for using the empirical estimator however the bias corrected network does identify some long distance edges for example between the houston and tampa regions it is important to note that al though takes on values between 0 and 1 its values should not be interpreted in a similar manner to correlation values a of 0 3 between two distant locations would imply strong tail dependence that is when one location experiences a very extreme event the other would have a 30 percent chance of also experiencing an extreme event individual links are hard to interpret and we do not believe there is some phenomenon that specifically links houston to tampa nevertheless these long distance network links at a minimum suggest that calculating annual risk between two distant regions like houston and tampa should not be done with an independence assumption as this would underestimate joint risk 16

for gulf coast in this subsection we construct annual extremal networks in the study region to examine the year to year structure specifically for each hurricane season we identify the connec tions where their edfs of the hurricane season maximum exceed 0 95 i e both places experience at least a 20 year event in that year see fig 6 for examples to further sutdy the long range extremal dependence we compute the number of pairs where their spatial distance are greater than 1 000 km we then study how the inter annual variability of 17 the numbers of these long distance extremal pairs might be explained by some mete orological covariate for example annual mean sea surface temperature sst averaged in a relevant spatial region here we use the hadley centre global monthly average sea surface temperature version 1 1 hadisst 1 1 rayner et al 2003 and we compute the spatial average of the annual mean sst over a rectangular region with longitude from 95 west to 83 west and latitude from 23 north to 29 north where the annual window is defined as from july of the previous year to june i e the 2017 mean sst is computed by averaging the monthly sst from july 2016 to june 2017 22 23 24 25 26

sst and 2017 is the year with the highest sst sst are added as images using a rainbow color scheme see the vertical col bars we explore the potential cause of the annual variation in the number of extremal connections as shown in fig 6 in fig 7 left panel we plot two time series together the red one for the proportion of the long distance i e 1 000 km extremal connections on a log scale log ratio hereafter where this log ratio is computed as the logarithm of the number of the connections divided by the total number of the long distance pairs in the study region in a given year the blue line is the sst time series there exists co movement between these two time series motivated us to perform regression analyses where we use the log ratio as the response and sst as the predictor see fig 7 right 18 panel specifically we perform two regression analyses to study this relationship first a linear regression lm log ratio 0 1 sst second a generalized linear model mccullagh and nelder 1989 assuming the number of the long distance extremal connections follows a poisson distribution with its log intensity denoted by log depends linearly on sst glm e log sst 0 1 sst both the lm although the homoscedasticity assumption is likely not appropriate here and glm model fits suggest that the sst can explain some proportion of the year to year variation observed in the number of long distance extremal pairs and the estimated slopes 1 and 1 are positive with p values 0 008 and 2 16 the results here suggest that the annual mean gulf coast sst may partly contribute to the abnormally

it is still largely unknown how the spatial de pendence of extreme precipitation may respond sparse summer convective precipitation events have typical radius around 10 100 km which lead to short distance spatial depen dence however major atlantic hurricanes can grow to 800 km measured with the outer radius of vanishing wind chavas et al 2016 such large low pressure system deliver huge amount of water when it moves from the warm ocean to land in this case faraway places like some regions in texas and florida could all encounter extreme precipitation during a hurricane season here our biase corrected network see fig 5 bottom panel captures a range of precipitation spatial dependence not only the common short distance connectivity among nearby stations but also the long distance connectivity across states associated with hurricane events with this overall understanding for the spatial ex tremal dependence we further examine the temporal variation of the annual extremal precipitation networks and we investigate the potential relationship with the us gulf coast sst the analyses in sec 3 3 reveal there exists a robust relationship between the number of long distance extremal precipitation connection in southern states of us and pre hurricane season previous year july to current year june sst in gulf of mexico it agrees with the understanding that increased ocean heat content leads to more tropical cyclone trenberth et al 2018 which in turn induces more long distance preciptation extremes in summary by combining the extremal dependence estimates with the net work analysis we are able to quantitatively measure how the hurricane induced extreme precipitation changes under climate change the network perspective enables us to reveal the structural change among a suite of stations which provide additional information to standard analysis based on individual locations 20 4 discussion this work presents two new tools the and annual extremal networks for exploring dependence structure of extreme values for space time data sets in contrast to the widely used correlation network in the climate literature the network uses statistics to summarize extremal dependence and is hence suitable for studying extremal dependence we demonstrate through a simulation study that a network constructed by using an empirical estimator could overestimate the degree of the network we found that this issue can also arise if one uses the sample correlation to construct a correlation network we propose a bias correction method to incorporate the spatial dependence structure to alleviate the network estimation bias for the network we expect that this bias correction procedure could also be used to overcome the bias in traditional correlation networks we then apply the network to the gulf coast hurricane season rainfall extremes to study the spatial dependence structure of the annual maximum precipitation observed over the gulf coast we also apply the annual extremal network to further explore the potential non stationary long range extremal dependence our results suggest that the sea surface tem perature may contribute to the abnormally long distance extremal dependence observed in the 2017 hurricane season due to the exploratory nature of the network there are some limitations in terms of providing the whole picture of the extremal dependence structure of an environmental process of interest first the statistic is a measure of pairwise tail dependence and hence not able to describe the higher order extremal dependence second is an appropriate extremal dependence metric in the case of asymptotic dependence it is less clear about the usefulness of this measure if the environmental process of interest exhibit weakening spatial dependence as events become more extreme huser et al 2017 wadsworth et al 2017 huser and wadsworth 2018 bopp et al 2018 in this work we make several simplifying assumptions for developing our bias corrected method in order to obtain a close form expression for our estimator one could try to 21 relax these assumptions at the price that the computations needed for a sampling based approach which can be substantial given that the number of pairs will be large for most environmental applications we prefer a simple method such as the one we proposed here that allows us to quickly explore the extremal dependence structure which could provide some guidance on how to proceed the following confirmatory analysis references m t bahadori and y liu granger causality analysis with hidden variables
