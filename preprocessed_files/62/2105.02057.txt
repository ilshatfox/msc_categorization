order flow in the financial markets from the perspective of the fractional l vy stable motion a preprint vygintas gontis institute of theoretical physics and astronomy vilnius university saule tekio al 3 10257 vilnius lithuania vygintas gontis eu november 5 2021 abstract it is a challenging task to identify the best possible models based on given empirical data of observed time series though the financial markets provide us with a vast amount of empirical data the best model selection is still a big challenge for researchers the widely used long range memory and self similarity estimators give varying values of the parameters as these estimators themselves are developed for the specific models of time series here we investigate from the general fractional l vy stable motion perspective the order disbalance time series constructed from the limit order book data of the financial markets our results suggest that previous findings of persistence in order flow could be related to the power law distribution of order sizes and other deviations from the normal distribution still orders have stable estimates of anti correlation for the 18 randomly selected stocks when absolute value and higuchi s estimators are implemented though the burst duration analysis based on the first passage problem of time series and implemented in this research gives slightly higher estimates of the hurst and memory parameters it qualitatively supports the importance of the power law distribution of order sizes keywords time series and signal analysis discrete stochastic dynamics scaling in socio economic systems fractional dynamics quantitative finance 1 introduction power law statistical properties are the characteristic feature of social systems the financial markets are providing us with a vast amount of empirical limit order book lob data that exhibit such power law statistical properties as well 1 the long range memory in finance and other natural and social systems is closely related to self similarity and power law statistical properties the empirical data and observed statistical properties of volatility trading activity and order flow in the financial markets are still among the most mysterious features attracting the permanent attention of researchers 2 3 4 5 6 the widely used measures of long range memory based on the self similarity and power law statistical properties are ambiguous as markov processes can exhibit long range memory properties including slowly decaying auto correlation 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 various models such as figarch fiegarch lm arch and arfima including fractional noise have been proposed for the volatility in the financial markets 14 2 15 16 17 18 19 our continuing research recently reviewed in 20 raises the question of whether the observed long range memory in social systems is a result of the actual long range memory process or just a consequence of the non linearity of markov processes earlier we have reduced the macroscopic dynamics of the financial markets to a set of stochastic differential equations sdes able to reproduce empirical probability density function pdf and power spectral density psd of absolute return 21 22 23 24 we used the same model to interpret the scaling behavior of volatility return use footnote for providing further information about author webpage alternative address not for acknowledging funding agencies ar x iv 2 10 5 02 05 7 v 2 q fi n s t 4 n ov 2 02 1 a preprint november 5 2021 intervals 25 for the empirical analysis it was helpful to employ the dependence of first passage time pdf on hurst exponent h 26 27 in search of long range memory properties for the volatility 23 24 and for the order flow 28 in the financial markets the proposed description is an alternative to the modeling incorporating fractional brownian motion fbm non linear sdes might be applicable in the modeling of other social systems where models of opinion or populations dynamics lead to the macroscopic description by the non linear sdes 29 thus the question of which model is best suited for interpreting empirical data is always a big challenge the most general initial assumptions help search for the correct answer there is tremendous interest in long range memory and self similar processes in particular fbm fractional l vy stable motion flsm and auto regressive fractionally integrated moving average arfima 30 31 32 these processes first of all serve for the modeling of systems with anomalous diffusion and expected fractional dynamics 33 the first two models are self similar with correlated increments the discrete time arfima process generalizes both models as in the limit it converges to either fbm or flsm self similar processes with non gaussian stable increments are essential for the modeling of social systems where power law distributions often interplay with auto correlations 34 35 36 in the previous paper 28 we investigated burst and inter burst duration statistical properties of order disbalance time series seeking to confirm or reject the long range memory in the order flow nevertheless we have to admit that the necessary assumption of non gaussian increments was missing in that research here we analyze the same lobster data of order flow in the financial markets 37 from the perspective of flsm and arfima models seeking to identify the impact of increment distributions and correlations on estimated parameters of self similarity the paper we organize as follows in section 2 we introduce fractional time series and methods used to evaluate the scaling parameters in section 3 we describe data sources of limit order books lob and define order disbalance time series in section 4 we apply selected methods to the data and demonstrate the particularities of burst and inter burst duration analysis in the concluding part we discuss the results and summarize the findings 2 fractional time series 2 1 fractional brownian motion fractional brownian motion fbm was proposed as a generalization of the classical brownian motion bm 38 it serves as a model of the correlated time series with stationary gaussian increments fbm of index h hurst parameter in the interval 0 h 1 is the mean zero gaussian process bh t the parameter h in fbm quantifies few essential properties fractal behavior long range memory and anomalous diffusion we will argue later that this is not the case for the other more general modeling thus we assume that hurst parameter h is responsible for the fractal properties of the trajectories and simultaneously for its property of self similarity for any a 0 bh at and ahbh t have identical distributions one can establish the relation with the fractal dimension of trajectories d 2 h as well 39 in analogy to the notions used in fractal geometry this type of process can be considered self similar very important property of many complex systems generating time series x t is the anomalous diffusion characterized by the mean square displacement msd growing as a power law of time x 2 t t where exponent defines the memory parameter d 1 2 for the fbm d h 1 2 33 for d 0 one observes dynamics as sub diffusion and for d 0 as super diffusion in experimental or empirical data analyses one usually deals with discrete time sample data series xi i 0 1 n we will use the sample msd defined as mn k 1 n k 1 n k i o xi k xk 2 1 note that msd definition using ensemble average is valid for the fbm while for the flsm diverges 30 the authors provide an evidence of flsm non ergodicity and that mn k k where 2 d 1 for large n k and n k thus the msd sample analysis of time series with flsm assumption becomes very important estimating the memory parameter d we denote by yi xi xi 1 i 1 n as increment process retrieved from the sample data series in the case of fbm increment process is called fractional gausssian noise fgn the long range memory usually is defined through the divergence of autocovariance k 40 k 1 n k 1 n k 1 i 1 yiyi k h 2 h 1 k 2 2 a preprint november 5 2021 where k 1 k when k for the fgn the exponent of auto correlation is defined by the hurst parameter 2 2 h we see that fbm is an essential process with various statistical properties defined by the hurst parameter thus researchers use an extensive choice of statistical estimators to determine h and evaluate memory effects even when fbm or fgn are not applicable for modeling sample data let us introduce a generalization of the fractional processes essential for modeling social systems where power law noise can appear in the very origin of the process one must decide which model to apply in the description of empirical data exhibiting anomalous diffusion d 6 0 as observed dynamics can originate from the long range memory or power law of the noise 2 2 fractional l vy stable motion gaussian distribution and models related to it are very important for the modeling of processes in nature nevertheless the complexity of processes in social systems often leads to the power law behavior and the distributions with fat tails are just indispensable thus one needs to generalize the fbm to the case of non gaussian distributions there is a special class of stable invariant under summation distributions 41 useful in the modeling both super and sub diffusion 33 here we are interested in the symmetric zero mean stable distribution defined by the stability index 0 2 this new parameter generalizing the previous fbm process and defining the shape of the new distribution is responsible for the power law tails of the new pdf p x x 1 the new process called fractional l vy stable motion flsm l h t is h self similar and stable with stationary increments when 2 one can recover fbm discussed in previous subsection see 41 33 for the precise flsm definition and relation with fbm widely accepted and investigated fbm forms the background for the many estimators of hurst exponent h accepting more general flsm approach one has to reevaluate previously used methods 28 20 as we now have at least two independent parameters the stability index 0 2 and memory parameter d since in the l vy stable case the second moment is infinite the measure of noise auto correlation e g the co difference 41 42 is used instead of covariance k k h 3 we have to admit that the parameter h d 1 has the strong dependence on when for the gaussian processes it was considered just as the indicator of long range memory the sample msd eq 1 should be a good estimator of memory parameter d mn k k 2 d 1 as stated in 30 it is widely accepted to analyze stochastic processes using the psd calculated by fourier transform of sample time series and finding the ensemble average even for the fbm the interpretation of sample psd is challenging as for h 1 2 psd exhibits the same frequency dependence as brownian motion and this property may lead to false conclusions 43 markov processes exhibiting psd s f 1 f confirm that power law properties of time series contribute to the behavior of s f 7 8 9 10 11 12 44 thus the extension of sample psd analysis for flsm is necessary to understand the relevant systems behavior fully and we do not include the psd analysis in this contribution rescaled range analysis r s 45 46 47 is one of the most popular estimators of h the method relies on the measure of scaled fluctuations thus first of all it reveals the property of self similarity we have to be careful using this method to evaluate the long range memory property as the relation with msd d h 1 2 and auto correlation of increments 2 2 h is valid only for the fbm for the other processes with stable distribution this method does not work properly as it involves normalization by the standard deviation 46 thus we do not use this method in this contribution one more method to quantify scaled fluctuations in the sample time series is the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis mf dfa 48 49 in the estimator s multifractal version one can discriminate between fractal and multifractal behavior of sample time series the method relies on the sample variance calculation thus it is not suitable for the non gaussian stable processes earlier we have proposed the burst and inter burst duration analysis as one more method to quantify the long range memory through the evaluation of h 23 29 24 28 when one dimensional sample time series fluctuations are bounded then any threshold divides these series into sequence of burst t bj and inter burst t i j duration j 1 nb the notion of burst and inter burst duration is directly related to the threshold first passage problem from the nearest its vicinity the burst duration is the first passage time from above and inter burst from below of the threshold see 28 24 23 29 for more details we have to revise the concept of burst duration analysis bda from the more general perspective of flsm fortunately ding and yang in 26 demonstrated that pdf of burst or inter burst duration p t scales in some region as p t th 2 4 this property has to be applicable not only for the fbm but also for the other fractional processes with the non gaussian distribution the authors demonstrated this scaling property for the deterministic chaotic processes where 3 a preprint november 5 2021 the increments are not gaussian and for the on off intermittency with fractional noise modulation thus we do expect that the scaling 4 might be applicable for the flsm as well note that this scaling property is invariant regarding non linear transformations of the time series 50 thus the self similarity h estimator based on this property might be applicable for the bounded diffusion cases nevertheless from the perspective of more general flsm processes the question of which properties can be recovered using this method is open and has to be investigated the method of absolute value estimator ave has been considered as working correctly even for the time series with infinite variance 40 51 42 39 the method is based on mean value n calculated from sample series yi and evaluating its scaling with length of sub series n sub series y n j 1 n jn i j 1 n 1 yi divide original series into m pieces of equal length n m n n calculate n n 1 m m j 1 y n j y 5 where y is the overall series mean then the absolute value scaling parameter hav can be evaluated from the scaling relation n nhav 1 6 one more almost equivalent estimator of scaling properties of the time series is higuchi s method 52 40 it relies on finding fractional dimension d of the length of the path the normalized path length ln in this method is defined as follows ln n 1 n 3 n i 1 1 m 1 m 1 j 1 xi jn xi j 1 n 7 and ln n d where d 2 h we will use both methods ave and higuchi s for the empirical analysis in this contribution 3 data in this contribution we continue our efforts understanding the nature of the long range memory phenomenon in socioeconomic systems 20 28 we aim to illustrate a numerical and heuristic approach to the sample empirical data of the financial market as the order flow data provide the best available self similar time series of social systems with expected long range memory property 34 35 36 our source of empirical data is limit order book data for all nasdaq traded stocks provided by limit order book system lobster 37 the limit order book lob data that lobster reconstructs originates from nasdaq s historical totalview itch files http nasdaqtrader com here we extend the list of stocks considered in 28 and construct daily time series of order flow in the period from 3 to 31 of august in 2020 a total of 21 working days we use the sample data from other periods to show that the main statistical properties we are interested in probably are independent of the selected period we use lobster data files message csv and orderbook csv for each selected trading day and ticker stock the message csv file contains the full list of events causing an update of lob in the selected price range we investigate orders up to the ten levels of prices in this research both files provide exact information about the instantaneous state of lob needed to define order disbalance time series any event j changing the lob state has a time value tj and order book has full list of volumes for the 10 price levels 10 buy volumes v k tj as well as 10 sell volumes v k tj seeking for the most simple interpretation of results in this contribution we define order disbalance event time series x j as the difference between all buy and sell orders or simple sum of disbalance increments y i x j 10 k 1 v k j v k j v j v j j i 1 y i 8 compare it with the normalized version used in 28 xn j v j v j v j v j where 1 xn j 1 the simplified definition of disbalance is preferable as it helps to establish a relationship with the discrete sum of random volume flow y i and a particular case of arfima process 32 the first two sub figures in fig 1 illustrate the example of simplified order disbalance empirical time series for the aapl stock the considered simplified empirical order disbalance time series still can serve as an example of opinion dynamics in the social system we will show below that pdf of y i has symmetric power law tails thus the time series x j might behave similarly as flsm or a particular case of arfima process consequently scaling properties of these series depend on pdf characterized by and memory characterized by d of increment series y i to clarify the different impacts of and 4 http

randomized and xrb t denotes randomized and bounded series d on the estimated scaling parameters we construct an artificial time series xr j excluding memory effects the proposed method to manipulate original empirical data helps quantitatively estimate the impacts of and d thus by replacing sequence of y i values in eq 8 by the random reshuffled sequence of the same empirical values yr i random y i we construct an artificial time series xr j with d 0 one can observe in fig 1 that though the series x t look bounded in the case of random increments series xr i become unbounded and non stationary ave and higuchi s methods work correctly with non stationary time series unbounded series is a problem for the burst duration analysis as they have only a few intersections with the threshold we will need one more transformation of the series xr j introducing bounds of diffusion xrb j 100000 see example in fig 1 this diffusion restriction is introduced as the soft boundary condition xrb i 1 max min xrb i yr i 100000 100000 note that the bounded random series xrb i must have the same exponent of inter burst duration pdf scaling as this property is invariant regarding such transformation 26 28 4 results we consider the simplified order disbalance time series retrieved from lobster data as described in the previous section we seek to reveal the behavior of the hurst parameter estimators regarding shuffling of the empirical series increments the procedure of increment shuffling is aimed at the task to compare the impacts of increment pdf and increment auto correlation the pdf of order volumes or more specifically in this research of order disbalance increments y i is rather sophisticated with resonance structure power law tails and some variability from stock to stock nevertheless this pdf is highly symmetric and stable from day to day thus contributes to the scaling properties of the time series constructed from the flow of order volumes in figure 2 we illustrate histograms of increment absolute values y i calculated for the two stocks aapl csco these histograms are calculated from the joint daily series in the whole period of 21 days two collar curves denoting pdfs of positive and negative values are almost indispensable but power law fitting straight lines give different exponent values 1 2 25 for aapl and 2 2 43 for csco note the resonance structure observed for the round numbers of volumes the non gaussian pdfs of increments are essential characteristics of stocks investigated from the perspective of flsm thus it is useful to know whether pdfs are the same in the various periods of observation in figure 3 we compare 5 a preprint november 5 2021 1 10 100 1000 104 105 10 11 10 9 10 7 10 5 0 001 0 100 y i p d f aapl 1 10 100 1000 104 105 10 11 10 9 10 7 10

daily and monthly histograms of aapl disbalance increments y i calculated for the distant periods the presented example and even more detailed investigation confirm that pdfs of increments are essential characteristics of stocks considered nevertheless we admit that deviations from the most probable form of pdf can appear in the specific trading periods but we leave these peculiarities outside the scope of this research the interpretation of burst duration analysis with the assumption of flsm is a challenging task it is well known that the first passage time pdf for any one dimensional markovian process with symmetric jump length distribution including l vy flights has the universal sparre andersen asymptotic p t t 3 2 53 54 27 55 56 nevertheless in the flsm case when d 0 and h 1 one might expect the first passage time pdf p t t 2 1 where 1 different from sparre andersen asymptotic of 3 2 we analyze inter burst duration pdf for the empirical order disbalance time series and for the shuffled time series of various stocks see the examples of csco inter burst duration histograms in the figure 4 both histograms exhibit power law behavior in the region up to the five orders of t values in the case of random order flow the pdfs of inter burst duration tr for different threshold values 0 5 1 0 1 5 almost coincide where denotes the standard deviation of time series in the period of investigation in empirical time series one observes the cutoff of power law for the high t values the area of power law is wider for the higher threshold values very preliminary bda of discrete flsm series generated using arfima 0 d 0 process with d 6 0 revealed that burst and inter burst duration pdfs depend on the threshold values giving different estimates of

us the average values of the memory parameter dmsd 0 16 with a standard deviation 0 08 exhibiting the behavior of sub diffusion one can observe considerable 7 a preprint november 5 2021 fluctuations of msd from stock to stock indicating variation of the memory effects or the sensitivity of the estimator to the stock dependent peculiarities of time series absolute value estimator eq 5 see columns hav and hav r gives considerably different values of the hurst parameter for the empirical and randomized time series with the assumption of flsm h d 1 we can evaluate d as d hav hav r we get the mean value for the stocks considered dav 0 32 and standard deviation 0 05 in columns hhig hhigr we provide results of evaluated h using higuchi s estimator eq 7 both methods give very similar results we get mean value of d evaluated by higuchi s estimator dhig 0 31 and the same standard deviation 0 05 the shift from empirical to randomized sequence of increments yr i gives us a more stable estimation of d than straightforward use of sample msd eq 1 from our perspective this might be related to the impact of the bounded nature of empirical time series and considerable deviations of the empirical increment pdfs from l vy stable form in the columns hbd hbdr we list h values defined fitting histograms of burst duration for the empirical and randomized series with zero threshold the values are scattered in the interval h 0 31 0 52 for the empirical and in the interval h 0 53 0 75 for the random series from the difference of h for the empirical and randomized series we get the mean value for the stocks considered dbd 0 20 and the standard deviation 0 07 the estimated memory parameter is closer to the value we get from the msd method values 1 in the last column defined from the power law of y i pdf see example in fig 2 are scattered in the wide interval 0 35 0 80 1 where denotes the exponent of power law tail of y i pdf note that empirical pdfs of y i considerably deviate from the form of stable distributions thus one can observe values of 1 smaller than 1 2 we do not use these empirical values of in evaluating h instead the method assumes the memory parameter as h difference for empirical and randomized series d h hr likely such an assumption might work even when deviations from l vy stable form are present the observed stability of defined memory parameters for various stocks probably supports this assumption to get a better sense of various scaling exponents provided in the table 1 we present them in fig 5 the pairs of values for the same stock hav and hav r hhig and hhigr hbd and hbdr are joined by straight lines to reveal the impact of memory effect h estimates bdr higr avr give us less scattered values of h for various stocks than 1 as one should expect from the theory of flsm 41 42 we have to admit here that empirical pdfs of increments have considerable deviations from the theoretical stable distributions with parameter note that h shifts of the randomized series are very stable for various stocks as lines in fig 5 indicate nevertheless the shift in the bda case is smaller and gives the estimation of dbd considerably closer to the msd estimation probably both methods give lower and more scattered values of dmsd indicating the dependence of the methods on the and other stock dependent peculiarities of the time series from our perspective this might be related to the bounded nature of empirical order disbalance series as well we have an indirect opportunity to check whether the evaluated value of memory parameter d 0 3 defined using higuchi s and absolute value estimators is reasonable one can get back to the correlated time series using the standard fractional sum procedure we denote the random sequence of increments as z i random y i than we can get back to the anti correlated time series yf i using the most simple version of the arfima 0 d 0 process 57 32 note that the both acronyms arfima and farima are used interchangeably in the literature let us consider that increments yf i are just the fractional sums xf i xf i 1 j 0 j d d j 1 z i j xf i 1 yf i 9 where is the gamma function in the left sub figure of fig 6 we compare pdfs of original adi order disbalance increments y i with reverted back increments yf i using parameter d 0 3 and eq 9 the infinite sum in eq 9 we approximate with the sum over 1000 terms both pdfs see black line for y i and red for yf i almost coincide only resonance structure was not recovered in the formal reversion procedure it is useful to check out other estimators with new reverted time series xf i on the right sub figure of fig 6 we illustrate the pdfs of burst duration t calculated for the time series x i xr i xf i of adi stock though there are many different peculiarities of the original x i and reverted xf i time series the correspondence of scaling exponents is pretty good see table 2 and fig 5 for the comparison of scaling exponents for the original and reverted time series of eighteen stocks note that exponents f of msd for the all reverted time series coincide and the corresponding value dmsdf 0 225 our numerical result given in figure 8 of 20 confirms theoretical prediction for the sample msd mn k k 2 d 1 30 of accumulated arfima 0 d 0 this independence of msd of stability parameter probably explains the empirical

applicable even for the time series with power law increment pdfs deviating from exact l vy stable form empirical analysis of order flow in the financial markets data from the perspective of flsm or arfima time series gives us a much more comprehensive understanding of this social system the absolute value and higuchi s estimators of the hurst parameter work exceptionally well with these time series despite considerable deviations of the noise from the exact l vy stable form more extensive investigation of burst duration analysis from flsm or arfima time series perspective and explanation of quantitative differences from the ave and higuchi s methods is needed 5 conclusions here we continue our efforts in understanding the long range memory phenomenon in social systems 20 in previous work 28 we investigated statistical properties of burst and inter burst duration in order disbalance real time and event time series seeking to discriminate true and spurious long range memory opportunities these results as previous findings in 34 35 36 showed that the limit order flow exhibits strong positive autocorrelation here we admit that many widely used estimators of long range memory were developed with the assumption of gaussian noise distribution 40 thus the more general approach based on the flsm or arfima models has to be implemented for the order flow analysis in the financial markets and other social systems 30 32 more careful investigation of order flow sizes tick sizes revealed that pdfs of tick sizes are specific for each stock with some power law tail exponents of power law tails range from 2 25 for aapl to 3 86 for acn thus the order disbalance time series as defined by eq 8 is just like the most simple case of accumulated arfima 0 d 0 process with empirical power law pdf of noise deviating from the gaussian and even from the stable l vy form the empirical time series x j with specific power law increments y i behave like self similar process many previously used estimators are not applicable in this case as variance of y i and x j might diverge in the continuous limit see 46 40 we selected estimators of self similarity in this contribution absolute value and higuchi s which are applicable for the non gaussian case we include burst duration analysis as well seeking a further investigation of possible applications of this method the first finding of this research is that empirically defined hurst parameters using absolute value and higuchi s estimators for all stocks is lower than 0 5 compare with previous findings 34 35 36 28 fluctuating around 0 7 the previous results are more consistent with the values of the hurst parameter we get with randomized time series xr j see hav r and hhigr columns in the table 1 and figure 5 nevertheless the most meaningful result is that comparison of hurst parameters for the empirical and randomized series gives us an estimation of memory parameter d dav hav hav r and dhig hhif hhigr both estimators give almost the same average values dav 0 32 and dhig 0 31 with the same standard deviation 0 05 calculated for the list of 10 a preprint november 5 2021 randomly selected eighteen stocks the result implies that order disbalance time series can be considered anti persistent with a pretty stable d we implemented an indirect check of flsm or arfima process assumption by the procedure of randomized series reversion back to the fractional as described by eq 9 the estimated scaling parameters for the reverted series are almost the same as for the original empiric but with the lower standard deviation see table 2 and fig 5 the finding serves as one more argument that order disbalance time series are self similar as flsm and arfima processes suggest previously defined persistence 34 35 36 28 is probably related to the power low pdfs of order sizes than to the long range memory effects it is important to know how various estimators of self similarity and memory effects work with flsm and arfima models being the most general theoretical concept of self similar processes the burst duration analysis considered in 26 23 29 24 28 is important here as the burst duration has straightforward relation to the properties of first passage time used in many practical applications 27 58 55 59 the shift of h estimated from bda in empirical and randomized order disbalance series gives the higher value of correlation parameter d 0 2 than ave and higuchi s methods nevertheless this method and msd confirm the presence of anti correlation in the original empirical order disbalance series andersen s theorem has been confirmed by extensive numerical simulations of the first passage time pdf 60 of symmetric l vy flights within a langevin dynamic approach nevertheless we must admit that the bda of the considered randomized empirical time series gives us considerably higher values of h than expected 0 5 more detailed theoretical and numerical investigation of burst duration and first passage time statistics for the flsm and discrete arfima processes with non gaussian noise is needed a theoretical investigation should help explain the observed contradiction with andersen s theorem in the case of uncorrelated increments in empirical series references references 1 m gould m porter s williams m mcdonald d fenn s howison limit order
