the ohio state university columbus usa lance a waller department of biostatistics and bioinformatics emory university atlanta usa summary opioid misuse is a national epidemic and a significant drug related threat to the united states while the scale of the problem is undeniable estimates of the local prevalence of opioid misuse are lacking despite their importance to policy making and resource allocation this is due in part to the challenge of directly measuring opioid misuse at a local level in this paper we develop a bayesian hierarchical spatio temporal abundance model that integrates indirect county level data on opioid related outcomes with state level survey estimates on prevalence of opioid misuse to estimate the latent county level prevalence and counts of people who misuse opioids a simulation study shows that our integrated model accurately recovers the latent counts and prevalence we apply our model to county level surveillance data on opioid overdose deaths and treatment admissions from the state of ohio our proposed framework can be applied to other applications of small area estimation for hard to reach populations which is a common occurrence with many health conditions such as those related to illicit behaviors keywords disease mapping downscaling hierarchical opioid epidemic small area estimation surveillance 1 introduction the opioid epidemic in the united states is a public health crisis office of national drug control policy executive office of the president of the united states 2011 drug en authors contributed equally ar x iv 2 10 1 01 23

drug overdose deaths in the united states exceeded 100 000 representing a 30 increase from the prior year cdc 2021 the opioid epidemic has been particularly severe in ohio in 2019 ohio had the fourth highest overdose death rate of 38 3 per 100 000 which was nearly double the national rate of 21 6 per 100 000 division of unintentional injury pre vention 2021 in addition to the epidemic of overdose death opioid misuse puts ohio at risk of epidemic levels of hepatitis c and hiv lerner and fauci 2019 knowledge of local prevalence of people who misuse opioids pwmo is imperative to quantifying the magnitude of the opioid epidemic however this quantity is an unobservable dynamic subset of the population and the lack of local estimates of pwmo is a significant barrier to the public health response to the opioid crisis schuler et al 2020 despite its importance for guiding a public health response surveillance of behaviorally linked conditions like substance use is challenging these conditions tend to vary at the local level and rely on self reported information which may not be reliable when dealing with an illicit behavior this limits the utility of large surveys because they are not typically designed to provide local estimates and are reliant on self reporting palamar et al 2016 while respondent driven sampling designs handcock et al 2014 craw ford et al 2018 have been implemented to generate estimates specific to local areas for hard to reach populations they are typically cross sectional and would be logistically difficult to implement across larger areas of interest thus there is a great need for local longitudinal population level estimates that cover an entire area of administrative interest like a state in ohio the local spatial unit of interest is the county as that most closely corre sponds to the structure of local health districts which form the basis for the allocation of state resources we lack direct information on the prevalence of pwmo in all of ohio s counties however we do have indirect information on this quantity in the form of surveillance data collected at the county level specifically we have access to counts of overdose deaths and treatment admissions annually for each county however neither surveillance outcome is a perfect reflection of pwmo because there are unique selection processes associated with capturing an individual in either observed outcome that are likely heterogeneous across space and time for example overdose death rates are likely related to supply of fentanyl in the local drug market pardo et al 2019 likewise treatment admissions are related to local access to care this heterogeneity prevents us from simply assuming that there is a perfect correlation between the surveillance out comes and underlying unobservable prevalence of pwmo instead we must explicitly account for these selection processes this is structurally similar to the problem faced in ecological applications of esti mating population abundance with unmarked observations and unknown detection i e selection probabilities briefly abundance models use hierarchical models to estimate the total number of individuals in a community when only a proportion can be observed at a given place and time royle 2004 kery and royle 2010 conceptually this is also similar to capture recapture approaches which have been applied to drug use and hiv in the past jones et al 2016 bao et al 2015 barocas et al 2018 min et al 2020 but does not require identification and tagging of individuals for our problem abundance model for misuse prevalence 3 the county level surveillance outcomes each reflect a proportion of the true population of pwmo in the county whom we are able to observe or detect since we lack individual identifying information we cannot use a capture recapture approach and instead will consider an extension of abundance modeling to estimate the count and prevalence of pwmo one documented challenge with abundance models is the ability to identify intercept parameters for both the latent abundance process and the detection process which im pedes accurate estimates of absolute abundance royle 2004 developed an n mixture model to estimate population size from count data but identifiability under this ap proach requires replicated observations of a closed or unchanging population so lymos et al 2012 suggested replication is unnecessary provided the number of spatial lo cations is large and there is at least one continuous covariate that is uniquely related to each distinct process however knape et al 2015 found that estimates of abso lute abundance from an n mixture model without replication were sensitive to model assumptions on the detection probabilities for our application we lack replication that is we do not have repeated observa tions of a stable population to allow us to uniquely identify both the intercept in the model for the unobserved population in the community and the intercept in the model for the partial proportion of the population observed facing a similar problem stoner et al 2019 used informative prior distributions to identify a hierarchical model for under reporting using a single observed surveillance outcome while this is a reasonable solution to the problem of non identifiability when such prior information exists results will be dependent on the choice of prior neath and samaniego 1997 instead we integrate multiple sources of data at the county and state levels to identify our model this is the notion behind integrated population models which are increasingly pop ular ecological models used to analyze population size by jointly modeling multiple data sources that share some underlying latent process these models can allow estima tion of parameters which would be non identifiable in a single outcome model besbeas et al 2002 schaub and abadi 2011 in our setting the models for the county level surveillance outcomes of overdose death and treatment counts both relate to the latent number of pwmo incorporating multiple county level surveillance outcomes creates pseudo replication because they show aggregate subsets of individuals who were de tected providing multiple partial views of the population of interest we also incorporate state level survey estimates of pwmo to inform the overall statewide prevalence which in turn provides information about the range of the detection probabilities required for identification of the model knape et al 2015 thus we use indirect count data on county level surveillance outcomes and an integrated abundance model framework to inform county level estimates of pwmo this can also be viewed as an approach for using the county level surveillance data to inform small area model based estimates that downscale the state level survey data to obtain county level estimates on pwmo in this paper we develop an extension to the abundance modeling framework that in tegrates multiple aggregate data sources at different spatial supports to estimate county level prevalence of pwmo we define pwmo as those who have misused opioids in the past year and are at risk of experiencing overdose death or treatment admission for opioid misuse in addition to prevalence and relative risks we estimate county level 4 hepler et al counts of pwmo which may ultimately be more useful for per capita resource alloca tion we will illustrate through simulation studies that our model accurately estimates the quantities of interest and is a drastic improvement over baseline approaches ignoring spatial heterogeneity we will also illustrate the benefits of including multiple surveil lance outcomes we then apply our methodology to data from ohio to estimate annual county level prevalence of pwmo over a 13 year period by doing so we provide a coherent framework for integrating multiple sources of data to estimate an unobservable quantity of critical importance for public health policy and resource allocation the rest of the paper is organized as follows we describe the available data in section 2 the modeling framework is detailed in section 3 we present the design and results of our simulation study in section 4 in section 5 we describe the results for the application to the data from ohio we discuss the implications of our findings in section 6 2 data since we lack direct county level data on pwmo our primary data sources will be an nual county level counts of overdose deaths and treatment admissions for each of ohio s 88 counties from 2007 2019 the most recent available year overdose death data are publicly available from the ohio public health data warehouse ohio public health data warehouse 2020 deaths are indexed to the county of residence of the decedent and are counted if the death certificate mentions poisoning from any opioid annual county level treatment admission counts were obtained through a data use agreement with the ohio department of mental health and addiction services treatment ad missions are indexed to the patient s county of residence and capture any residential intensive outpatient or outpatient treatment for opioid misuse data were provided broken down into two age groups adolescents and adults but will only be considered in total for this study state policy requires counts between 1 and 9 to be suppressed caus ing some counties to have censored counts population data used for calculating rates are estimates from the national center for health statistics and were also obtained from the ohio public health data warehouse ohio public health data warehouse 2020 our model also incorporates state level survey estimates of the prevalence of pwmo from the national survey on drug use and health nsduh samhsa center for behavioral health statistics and quality 2003 2005 2006 2008 2009 2010 2011 2014 2015 2016 2016 2017 2017 2018 2018 2019 we obtain state level estimates for past year nonmedical opioid use for surveys prior to 2015 and past year opioid misuse after 2015 the language of the survey question was updated in 2015 but we assume the same underlying construct is addressed over time the survey data for ohio are estimates of multi year averages of the statewide prevalence of misuse the supplementary material contains the multi year estimates of the statewide prevalence along with the standard errors note that the county level data are from the years 2007 t 1 to 2019 t 13 but we incorporate survey information from 2003 t 3 to 2019 into the model the survey estimates are shown in supplemental table 1 we utilize county level estimates of sociodemographic characteristics from the amer ican community survey acs using the r package tidycensus variables obtained abundance model for misuse prevalence 5 included poverty rate unemployment rate the proportion with at least a high school degree and the proportion on food stamps acs estimates of the 5 year averages are available for all n 88 counties in ohio from 2009 2019 acs estimates for the individ ual years are available for 38 of the 88 counties we also acquired publicly available data on opioid prescribing rates from the ohio automated rx reporting system oarrs which was available from 2010 2019 in addition we compiled county level indicators of health professional shortage areas hpsa and medically underserved areas mu from the health resources and services administration high intensity drug trafficking areas hidta from the drug enforcement agency and metropolitan statistical areas msa from the united states census bureau we also created an indicator of whether an interstate highway passed through each county to reflect transportation networks 3 model let y k it be the count of pwmo who experience outcome k 1 k in county i 1 n during year t 1 t note that in our application k 2 and k 1 2 refer to treatment admissions and overdose deaths respectively we also observe state level survey information denoted sa b regarding the estimated statewide average prevalence of opioid misuse for the multi year time period from year a to year b inclusive we are ultimately interested in estimating the latent number of pwmo in county i during year t nit and the relative risk of misuse it as in berliner 1996 we use a three stage bayesian hierarchical model to relate the observed data to the latent processes of interest the data process and prior layers of the model are defined in the following subsections 3 1 data model 3 1 1 county level surveillance data we start by specifying a model for the observed county level surveillance outcomes assume y k it nit p k it ind binomial nit p k it 1 where logit p k it k t x k it k f k it k it in the logistic regression model for each outcome k k t is a time varying intercept x k it is a vector of centered covariates k is a vector of regression coefficients f k it is a spatio temporal random effect and k it iid n 0 2 k accounts for additional unexplained heterogeneity we assume that each surveillance outcome is conditionally independent given the underlying true number of pwmo that is we assume marginal dependence between the counts within a county is attributable to the number of pwmo in that county for our application the design matrix for treatment rate x 1 contains indicator variables that identify the counties that are classified as hpsa and mu the design matrix for death rate x 2 contains indicator variables for whether or not the county contains an interstate whether the county is a hidta and whether the county belongs to a msa 6 hepler et al as mentioned in section 2 the age group specific treatment counts are suppressed if they are between 1 and 9 however we can incorporate the knowledge that suppressed counts are within that interval into our model by adapting the approach of famoye and wang 2004 for interval censoring there are three cases of censoring that we encounter here denoted by the indicator cit 0 total count observed 1 adolescent count censored 2 adolescent and adult counts censored 2 for cit 0 we observe both the adult and adolescent counts and so the total treatment count is their sum for cit 1 we observe the adult count but the adolescent count is censored so we know that the total count must be between the adult count plus 1 and the adult count plus 9 finally for cit 2 both counts are censored so we know the total count must be between 2 and 18 let y 1 it 0 be the adolescent treatment count and y 1 it 1 be the adult treatment count then we have y 1 it y 1 it 0 y 1 it 1 cit 0 y 1 it 1 cit 1 0 cit 2 3 and the likelihood from equation 1 becomes l p 1 p 2 n y 1 y 2 13 t 1 88 i 1 f y 2 it p 2 it nit 13 t 1 88 i 1 f y 1 it p 1 it nit i cit 0 f y 1 it 9 p 1 it nit f y 1 it p 1 it nit i cit 1 4 f 18 p 1 it nit f 1 p 1 it nit i cit 2 where f p 1 it nit is the cumulative distribution function and f p 1 it nit is the probability mass function of the binomial distribution with population size nit and rate p 1 it and f p 2 it nit is the probability mass function of the binomial distribution with population size nit and rate p 2 it 3 1 2 state level survey data for the survey information regarding overall statewide prevalence of misuse between years a and b given by sa b we assume a normal distribution truncated to 0 1 the standard error s ea b is estimated from the survey and assumed to be known we assume a truncated normal distribution to enable the direct incorporation of the mean and standard error reported from the survey in addition we let t denote the true latent abundance model for misuse prevalence 7 statewide prevalence of misuse in year t and assume this is linear over time such that t 0 1 t note that this formulation requires survey data to be observed for at least two time periods more specifically we assume sa b 0 1 n 0 1 1 b a 1 b t a t s e 2 a b 5 so that the mean of sa b is the mean of the true statewide prevalence during the time period from a to b the linearity assumption for t implies the mean function is 1 b a 1 b t a t 0 1 1 b a 1 b t a t 0 1 b 2 b a 2 a 2 b a 1 we assume survey estimates are independent of one another conditional on the true statewide rate of misuse 3 2 process model we are primarily interested in estimating the latent number of pwmo nit and the rel ative risk of misuse it we assume a non canonical spatial rates like parameterization cressie et al 2005 cressie and wikle 2011 nit it ind binomial pit t it where pit is the known population of county i during year t let it represent the relative risk of misuse in county i during year t compared to a statewide average prevalence t subject to the constraint 0 t it 1 recall t is assumed to be linear across time and is informed by survey data as described in section 3 1 2 we use a non standard parameterization because the survey data reflects a state average which is not equivalent to the intercept of a standard logistic regression note that we could also consider a poisson model for the latent counts the large population size and small rates of misuse imply these models will yield near identical results we chose a binomial model to explicitly allow for the known population size pit assume log it wit uit vit where wt is a design matrix for time t containing centered covariates without an intercept uit is a spatio temporal random effect and vit iid n 0 2 v for the spatio temporal random effect uit we assume an intrinsic conditional autoregressive icar model with an autoregressive of order one ar 1 temporal trend besag 1974 more specifically this model assumes for t 1 uit u i t 2 u n 1 wi j wijujt 2 u wi 6 and for t 2 t uit u i t ui t 1 2 u u n uui t 1 1 wi j wij ujt uuj t 1 2 u wi 7 8 hepler et al where u i t ujt j 6 i wij is an indicator that counties i and j share a border and wi j wij is the total number of neighbors for county i let ut u 1 t unt denote the vector of random effects during year t the intrinsic models specified by equations 6 and 7 yield joint distributions with probability density functions u 1 2 u exp 1 2 2 u u 1 h a u 1 for t 1 ut ut 1 2 u u exp 1 2 2 u ut uut 1 h a ut uut 1 for t 2 t where a is the adjacency matrix whose i j th element is wij and h is a diagonal matrix with i i th element wi the above are not valid probability densities since the precision h a is less than full rank however the icar model is a valid process level model provided a centering constraint i uit 0 for all t k is enforced banerjee et al 2004 in this application we chose to include standardized county level covariate informa tion on poverty rate unemployment rate the percentage with at least a high school degree the percentage on food stamps and the opioid prescribing rate per capita as covariates for relative risk of misuse the prescribing rate data from oarrs is only available from 2010 to 2019 thus this variable is only included in wt for t 4 t as discussed in section 1 it is well known that the single visit abundance model suffers from non identifiability of intercept parameters to see this more clearly one can show that in the single outcome k 1 case integrating out the latent count nit yields the marginal distribution y k it p k it t it binomial pit t itpit the product form for the rate implies these quantities and in particular the intercept parameters t and k t cannot be individually identified without additional information however our model s integration of multiple data sources eliminates this issue in particular the survey data directly informs t also note that by jointly modeling k 1 outcomes the joint marginal distribution of the outcomes after summing over the possible values of nit does not take the same simple marginal form that results with the single outcome setting by proposing an integrated model that jointly models multiple data sources we are able to identify the primary quantities of interest nit and it achieving identifiability by integrating multiple data sources is discussed in besbeas et al 2002 and section 9 2 of cole 2020 the models for the surveillance outcomes depend on spatio temporal random effects f k it these are specified similarly to the spatio temporal random effects in the process level model for the relative risk of misuse in particular for each outcome k we assume an icar model with an ar 1 temporal trend analogous to 6 7 with conditional variance parameter 2 k and temporal autocorrelation parameter k we assume these random effects are independent across the k outcomes in more traditional models we would expect these rates to be correlated within a county because they share a common underlying process the latent number of pwmo in that location however we explicitly account for that process as the outcome models are specified conditional on the latent number of pwmo so that these random effects capture residual spatial variability in the outcome specific rates of opioid overdose death and treatment admissions we a priori abundance model for misuse prevalence 9 do not believe these conditional rates would follow similar spatial trends if instead we were modeling outcomes that were believed to be correlated conditional on nit this model can easily be generalized to a multivariate conditional autoregressive model 3 3 acs covariate model our process model relates the relative risk of misuse it to centered covariates from the acs in the design matrix wt however only 5 year average estimates are available for all 88 counties which leads to temporal misalignment with the annual estimates of interest to account for this and the additional uncertainty from using multi year average estimates we add an additional layer to the data and process stages of the model similar to the work of bradley et al 2015 to account for uncertainty in the latent yearly county level values of these variables this additional layer leverages the annual estimates that are available in 38 counties to inform the latent annual value in counties where only 5 year average estimates are available let 5 it and 1 it denote the 5 year and 1 year estimates from the acs for one of the variables of interest with standard errors 5 and 1 respectively let it denote the true latent value of this variable in county i during year t the columns of the design matrix wt corresponding to the acs variables contain standardized variables and are thus functions of these latent it for t 3 t and each of the acs variables included we assume 5 it n 0 100 1 5 t t 4 i 2 5 1 it n 0 100 it 2 1 8 where n 0 100 denotes the normal distribution truncated to 0 100 since our variables of interest are recorded as percentages observe that even though we only include acs estimates from 2009 2019 we infer latent values of the yearly variables from 2005 2019 in the process level of the model we assume the latent yearly percentages follow it ind n 0 100 t 2 i where t denotes a statewide average for that variable in year t this community level process model for the latent variables permits some borrowing of strength across the counties improving estimation in the counties that only have 5 year estimates available we note that a more complicated spatio temporal structure could be considered here as was done in bradley et al 2015 but it comes with additional computational expense 3 4 prior model and posterior distribution all intercepts and regression coefficients k t k 0 1 and are independently as signed flat uniform prior distributions on the real line the statewide average yearly per centages for the acs variables t are assigned a uniform prior distribution over 0 100 all variance parameters 2 k 2 k 2 u 2 v and 2 i are assumed to have inverse gamma prior distributions with shape and scale parameters of 0 5 the temporal autoregressive pa rameters k u are assumed to be uniform over 0 1 the posterior distribution of 10 hepler et al the latent processes and parameters is simulated using an adaptive metropolis within gibbs markov chain monte carlo mcmc algorithm implemented using the r package nimble de valpine et al 2017 to improve the efficiency associated with sampling highly correlated variables for each county i the latent counts ni 1 nit are updated jointly using an automated factor slice sampler as in stoner et al 2019 nimble enforces the zero mean constraint in the icar models with a commonly used approach of updating these variates without the constraint and then centering paciorek 2009 convergence of the markov chain was assessed by visually inspecting trace plots the r code is included in the supplementary material 4 simulation study we performed a simulation study to assess the proposed model s ability to accurately predict latent counts of misuse nit and relative risk it we fixed values of all hyper parameters and simulated m 100 latent processes and data sets from the proposed model where each data set consisted of t 10 years of data for each of n 100 counties on a 10 10 grid for k 2 county level outcomes and also yearly survey estimates of statewide prevalence this mimics the setting for the ohio data we consider in section 5 where the county level outcomes correspond to treatment admission counts k 1 and death counts k 2 note that for the purpose of the simulation we assume the survey estimates are yearly and not multi year averages and we assume covariates used in the design matrix w are known so no process level model is needed for these values specific details regarding how the data were simulated are in the supplementary material for each of the m 100 simulated data sets we fit the proposed model under two scenarios 1 assuming we observed yearly survey information and 2 assuming we only observed survey information in years 2 5 8 which we will refer to as the sparse survey information scenario these cases reflect a slightly better and slightly worse case than the actual multi year average survey data that is available for the application we will compare the results of our proposed joint model to a baseline model that assumes the state level survey estimate applies to all counties rembert et al 2017 burke and buchanich 2018 i e no spatial heterogeneity such that n it tpit and to a model using only a single county level outcome e g death counts stoner et al 2019 we used the r package nimble to run a mcmc algorithm for each of the m data sets under each scenario to assess performance we used the posterior mean as our estimate of latent misuse n it for each simulated data set and computed 95 equal tail credible intervals we used several different criterion to assess how well each approach estimated the true latent counts nit and relative risk it we computed the coverage probabilities cp of the credible intervals for the latent counts the root mean squared error rmse of the counts and of the relative risk as well as the relative median absolute error mae for the counts 4 1 simulation results the main findings of the simulation study are summarized here with additional results in the supplementary material briefly the error rates of the proposed model were abundance model for misuse prevalence 11 table 1 a

setting table 1 and figure 1 the average coverage probabilities of the credible intervals were very close to the target value of 95 we also compared the results of our proposed joint model to the model that only considers a single county level outcome y 2 it in addition to the survey data for both the yearly and sparse survey data cases the proposed joint model yields a coverage probability that is closer to 95 than would be obtained modeling just a single county level outcome we also see that the proposed joint model yields smaller errors for almost all of the 100 simulated data sets with the average error reduced by at least 20 table 2 and figure 2 in addition to illustrating that the proposed model has smaller error than competing approaches we also show that on average the proposed model recovers the true param eters of the data generating model in supplemental figure 1 we show that we were able to estimate the intercept parameters t 0 and 1 1 t and 2 t this suggests that we have adequate information on the range of the detection probabilities to over come the identifiability issues that are common with abundance models in addition we show in supplemental figure 2 that we are able to estimate the relative risks it quite well across the 100 simulated data sets the average difference between the true and estimated it is 0 003 likewise we show scatterplots of the estimates against the true values for three randomly selected simulated data sets in supplement figure 3 and see points clustered around the y x line which indicates that the model is generally recovering the truth again this suggests that we are able to recover the true values of the model parameters suggesting that we have adequate information to inform the model and practically overcome challenges related to identifiability in summary our simulation study showed that our model accurately recovers the latent counts and relative risks and drastically outperforms the baseline model we have also shown that our model with sparse survey information still outperforms the baseline model although it is not as good as having yearly survey data we observe that perfor mance is improved by including multiple observed surveillance outcomes compared to using only a single outcome finally we illustrated that the integration of state level sur vey information overcomes limitations of traditional abundance models and adequately informs the estimation of model parameters abundance model for misuse prevalence 13 fig 2 boxplots of the rmse for the counts nit left and relative risk it

prevalence estimates in this section we apply the model defined in section 2 to estimate the unobserved number of pwmo from 2007 2019 for each of ohio s n 88 counties to do so we utilize t 13 years of observed county level counts of opioid overdose death and treatment admissions and multi year state level survey estimates of the prevalence of opioid misuse figure 3 maps the posterior mean of the estimate prevalence n it pit and figure 4 contains the posterior standard deviation maps for the estimated log relative risk log it are in the supplementary material we observe county level and yearly het erogeneity with prevalence ranging from approximately 0 to nearly 0 13 we observe the highest prevalence in southern ohio which is commonly considered the epicenter of the opioid epidemic in ohio this map also identifies the counties whose estimated counts of the pwmo are significantly different than would be obtained under the naive baseline estimate that assumes a homogeneous statewide rate estimated from the survey data more specifically the counties outlined in yellow have 95 credible intervals ci that are entirely above the baseline estimate and the counties in blue have cis that are entirely below the statewide average prevalence of misuse parameters were estimated to be 0 0 0535 with 95 ci 0 0516 to 0 0557 and 1 0 0006 with 95 ci 0 0009 to 0 0004 table 3 contains the corresponding information for the prevalence of misuse regression coefficients we observe a 5 increase in prevalence per standard deviation increase in unemployment and high school education a roughly

this is likely due to the influx of fentanyl in these regions during this time period daniulaityte et al 2017 pardo et al 2019 table 4 shows the posterior means and 95 credible intervals for the odds ratios for the death rate we estimate that the odds of death are 19 higher in metropolitan statistical areas compared to non metropolitan areas similarly figure 6 maps the estimated treatment rates among pwmo p t it a map of the standard errors is in the supplementary material we generally see an increasing treatment rate over time with the largest rates in southern ohio which is known to have received a large number of resources towards treatment of opioid misuse governor s cabinet opiate action team 2012 table 4 shows the posterior means and 95 credible intervals for the treatment rate odds ratios we estimate that the odds of treatment are 9 less in health professional shortage areas compared to non shortage areas figure 7 plots the time varying intercepts for death and treatment rates d t and t t recall the covariates included for both logistic regression models are indicator variables so the intercepts for death are interpreted as the yearly average death rates on the logit scale among counties without interstates that are neither high impact drug trafficking areas nor metropolitan statistical areas we generally observe an increasing trend with a sharp increase beginning in 2012 the years following 2012 correspond to 16 hepler et al fig 6 maps of the estimated treatment rates p t it for each county from 2007 to 2018 the time in which fentanyl began to infiltrate the state resulting in a drastic increase in overdose deaths pardo et al 2019 the estimates of t t represent the yearly average treatment rates on the logit scale among counties that are neither health professional shortage areas nor medically underserved areas we see a generally increasing trend with slight shifts observed in 2010 and also in 2014 we note that these time periods align with the passing of state legislation expanding access to treatment governor s cabinet opiate action team 2012 and also with medicaid expansion which occurred in ohio in 2014 6 discussion in this paper we developed an approach for estimating the county level prevalence of pwmo using indirect information from observed aggregate surveillance outcomes syn thesized within an abundance model framework by integrating state level external information we showed that our model can identify the intercepts at both the level of the latent counts and for the observed surveillance data we also show that this approach is superior to assuming homogeneity across counties and to using a single surveillance outcome by coherently leveraging joint information across data sources we were able to recover model based estimates of the latent counts of interest we applied our framework to estimate annual county level counts and prevalence of pwmo in ohio over a 13 year period by doing so we were able to estimate the prevalence of pwmo which is extremely relevant for public health policy and until this point estimates did not exist at the county level across the state in addition we estimated death and treatment rates within the population of pwmo this is in contrast to typical epidemiological analyses that define the population at risk as the whole population rather than just the pwmo therefore the estimates of these rates are more relevant for describing trends in pwmo and informing the targeting of resources and harm reduction interventions these estimates can also be used to fill data gaps by informing key model parameters in simulation models developed to inform policy choices abundance model for misuse prevalence 17 fig 7 plot of the time varying intercepts for treatment and death jalali et al 2020 we also described associations with covariates at each level of the model our work forms a foundation for this line of research as there are additional method ological challenges to address for instance the primary goal of our simulation study was to establish the model s ability to accurately estimate the latent counts and preva lence of pwmo we have not thoroughly assessed the conditions required to accurately estimate covariate effects this issue of identifying covariate effects for both observed and latent processes has been studied under various settings e g lele et al 2012 hepler et al 2018 stoner et al 2019 but the results of those papers may not hold since we integrate multiple observed variables at the desired spatial support with addi tional information at the state level a future research question is to investigate how well and under what conditions our model can estimate covariate effects additional avenues for future research include studying advantages and disadvantages of including more outcome variables and also utilizing our model to evaluate policy and optimize resource allocation our analysis has several limitations first we assume the surveillance outcomes are observed without error but there is potential for misclassification particularly of overdose deaths slavova et al 2015 however ohio is considered to have excellent reporting of overdose deaths scholl et al 2019 we also use survey estimates to inform the intercepts which are potentially underreported while the model can flexibly ad just estimates around the parameters informed by the survey future work will formally explore sensitivity to bias in the survey estimates in addition the language of the sur 18 hepler et al vey question addressing opioid misuse was changed in 2015 which may have impacted responses we also assume that all individuals counted as a treatment admission or an overdose death belong to the population of pwmo while this is a reasonable assump tion it is unlikely to be universally true particularly as fentanyl is unknowingly added to other substances mars et al 2019 townsend et al 2021 in addition all analyses are aggregate and should be interpreted at the appropriate level to avoid the ecological fallacy pianntadosi et al 1988 in conclusion we have a developed a model within the abundance model framework to estimate the size of hidden populations using observed data that provide indirect information through synthesis of multiple sources of data we are able to generate model based estimates of hidden quantities that are critical for informing public health policy and the allocation of resources we believe this is a promising framework for addressing questions about hidden epidemiological populations and can provide a foun dation for future research acknowledgements research reported in this publication was supported by the national institute on drug abuse of the national institutes of
