orcid org 0000 0003 3555 3425 february 8 2022 abstract it is argued that there is a need for fat tailed distributions that be come thin in the extreme tail a 3 parameter distribution is introduced that visually resembles the t distribution and interpolates between the normal distribution and the cauchy distribution it is fat tailed but has all moments finite and the moment generating function exists it would be useful as an alternative to the t distribution for a sensitivity analysis to check the robustness of results or for computations where finite moments are needed such as in option pricing it can be mo tivated probabilistically in at least two ways either as the random thinning of a long tailed distribution or as random variation of the variance of a normal distribution its properties are described algo rithms for random number generation are provided and examples of its use in data fitting given some related distributions are also dis cussed including asymmetric and multivariate distributions keywords blurred truncation cauchy distribution heavy tails finite moments poly t distribution 1 introduction heavy tailed distributions that generalize the normal distribution abound with the generalized hyperbolic distribution perhaps being the most all inclusive e g barndorff nielsen and stelzer 2005 however in a finite 1 http arxiv org abs 2202 03253 v 1 world heavy tails cannot continue for ever a simple example is the cauchy distribution e g johnson et al 1995 somewhat alarmingly exemplified as the distribution of bullet holes made on a wall by a rotating gun in the real world the wall would be finite giving sharp truncation to the cauchy distribution even with an arbitrarily long wall the bullets would not travel arbitrarily far because of air resistance and gravity giving censoring or what one might call blurred truncation a thinning of the tail in general one would expect blurred truncation of long tailed distributions to be common in a finite world thus the distribution of the heights of athletes might have a long tail but physical limits eventually impose a cut off the tallest man ever known of had a height of only 2 72 metres thus ideally a fat tailed distribution with an eventual cutoff is required because even a distribution with infinite thin tails has some probability for impossible values of the random variate for example concerning athlete heights a thin tailed distribution has a small probability for the impossibly tall or even for negative heights however estimating a cutoff parameter is difficult and so it seems best to settle for a distribution that is thin in the extreme tails and so has only a tiny probability for impossible occur rences the need for this more realistic modelling of long tailed data is the motivation for this work there is a second reason for seeking fat tailed distributions that are thin in the extreme tail besides their physical implausibility heavy tailed dis tributions have some moments undefined or infinite which causes problems for some analyses although usually the problem is only a minor one thus long tailed distributions model financial returns such as ftse returns much better than the normal approximation used in deriving the famous black scholes option pricing formula in fitting financial indices such as the ftse given successive values si 1 si the logged return xi ln s 1 si 1 can be fitted to a t distribution the actual return is si si 1 si 1 exp xi 1 computing the expected return under some conditions then requires the ex istence of the means of exponentials of the random variable hence cassidy et al 2010 found that an integral needed for pricing european options which was essentially the truncated moment generating function then di verged and truncation of the t distribution was needed to avoid an infinite result in general many workers have cited infinite moments as a problem and have introduced and studied truncated long tailed distributions e g nadarajah 2011 apart from financial calculations of the kind described where all moments must exist in general the first four sample moments are useful for characterising distributions especially via measures such as skew 2 ness and kurtosis they can also be used for estimating model parameters by the method of moments or finding good starting values for methods of estimation such as maximum likelihood this last cannot be done if these moments are undefined or infinite in the model to construct a fat tailed distribution with all moments existing for the bullet holes example given assume a raleigh distribution with survival func tion s x exp x 2 2 for the distance x along the wall a bullet can travel in either direction the resulting pdf would be k exp x 2 2 1 x 2 where the constant k can be found analytically it is here called the nc 1 distribution and interpolates between a cauchy distribution as 0 and a normal distribution as the t distribution also does so although the t distribution can have even longer tails than the cauchy here however all moments exist further the moment generating function also exists this distribution is a special case of the double t distribution the poly t distribution pdf is a product of t pdfs and is discussed by dre ze 1977 who gives an account of the origin of the name more recently nadarajah 2009 has given the properties of the double t distribution however the special cases given here are of value because they are much more mathe matically tractable than the general case have fewer parameters and have proved useful in fitting data the following sections describe the tractable types of double t distri bution finally some data fits are briefly discussed and conclusions drawn many calculations have been checked via purpose written programs and one such was used for the data fitting using the nag numerical algorithms group library of routines 2 the double t distribution and its special cases the special case of the poly t distribution considered by nadarajah 2009 has pdf f x c 1 x 2 a 1 a 2 1 x 2 b 1 b 2 where the mean has been taken as zero this is the product of two t pdfs with a common mean but different spreads and numbers of degrees of freedom specialising to the case where a gives what one might call the n t distribution the general case of the distributions considered here this is a 4 parameter distribution where the long tails of the t distribution can eventually become thin generalizing the cauchy distribution to a t 3 distribution a generalization of the nc 1 pdf would have pdf f x c exp x 2 2 1 x 2 1 for 0 a t type distribution with a raleigh survival function for events to be accepted we can write 1 2 where is the number of degrees of freedom of a t distribution and 1 then generalizes the t distribution however it can show even more extreme tail behaviour when 0 1 2 before the eventual thin tail we can also take 0 when the distribu tion becomes short tailed it is unimodal if 2 with 1 2 the excess kurtosis is 0 385 this n t distribution is then the short tailed distribution of tiku and vaughan 1999 with the affine transformation x y s the distribution of y has 4 parameters s the constant c cannot be found analytically and requires the eval uation of an integral but the distribution can still be used for data fitting evaluating c by numerical quadrature this does not become a large compu tational burden even when is a function of covariates because c only needs to be evaluated once per likelihood iteration as it is not a function of the mean the parameters both control tail behaviour this distribution is fitted to data by maximum likelihood later some special cases are mathematically more tractable the case where 1 2 given in appendix b and where is an integer calling these nc n dis tributions for pdfs that are the product of normal and cauchy pdfs to the power n the introductory example is an nc 1 distribution the nc 2 distribution corresponds to a normal pdf times a t 3 pdf and so on it was found as expected that the nc 1 distribution is needed for fitting very long tailed data but in practice the nc 2 distribution is arguably more useful certainly for non financial datasets the nc n distributions are the main focus here especially where n is 1 or 2 but other cases are given in appendix a and a multivariate distribution in appendix b 3 properties of the nc n distributions 3 1 probabilistic genesis and pdf the approach here can be thought of as taking a long tailed distribution and censoring or thinning its tails according to the survival function of a second distribution to obtain a new distribution with some desired prop erties one probabilistic basis for the nc 1 distribution has already been alluded to random numbersx originate from a cauchy distribution and are 4 accepted with a probability exp x 2 2 alternatively a random number could originate from a normal distribution and be accepted with probability 1 1 x 2 note that in the bullets on the wall example the probability of acceptance varies with the line of flight distance r which for a gun a dis tance a from the wall is given by r 2 x 2 a 2 hence a raleigh distribution for r still gives a term exp x 2 2 another probabilistic basis is to consider a normally distributed random variable where the inverse standard deviation is a random variable with pdf g z a gaussian truncated below at 1 2 i e g z exp z 2 2 2 for z 1 2 where is the normal distribution function then the pdf is 1 2 z exp 1 x 2 z 2 2 dz 2 k exp x 2 2 1 x 2 2 where k exp 2 2 the integral over the pdf 2 is given in gradshteyn and ryzhik 2015 as result 3 466 1 albeit in different notation it is the exclusion of high variances 1 that gives the blurred trun cation to the cauchy distribution with the generalized hyperbolic dis tribution the generalizing distribution is the generalized inverse gaussian distribution so this does not produce blurred truncation the form 2 is useful for derivations but for practical use it is convenient to reparameterize the distribution setting 1 and x x 1 1 2 to obtain the pdf f x c 1 exp x 2 2 1 1 x 2 3 where c 1 1 1 2 exp 2 1 2 1 1 2 and 0 1 then as 0 the cauchy distribution is obtained and as 1 the distribution becomes standard normal the random variable y will then be an affine transformation of x without this reparameterization the standard 1 parameter distribution would interpolate between cauchy as 0 and a normal distribution of zero variance as in general here is analogous to the number of degrees of freedom of the t distribution figure 1 shows the nc 1 pdf for several values of and figure 2 shows the t distribution with 5 degrees of freedom with the closest nc 1 distribution as measured by hellinger distance this was selected for illustration as the distributions are identical with 1 and infinite but it was not evident how close they would be in between except in the extreme tails the distributions look very similar 5 0 0 05 0 1 0 15 0 2 0 25 0 3 0 35 0 4 0 45 4 2 0 2 4 p d f x cauchy beta 0 beta 0 05 beta 0 25 beta 0 5 beta 1 figure 1 the pdf of the nc 1 distribution for different values of the tail weight parameter 1 the nc 1 distribution has a slightly higher peak because there is less probability in the extreme tails it has slightly thinner shoulders and is fatter in the tail before the tail finally thins the excess kurtosis is 6 for the t distribution and 1 50 for the nc 1 distribution showing that although the distributions look similar the nc 1 tail is eventually thin the standard 1 parameter form for x is described here with x y s for the 3 parameter distribution of y with arbitrary mean and variance 3 2 moments moments exist for 0 the odd moments are all zero by symmetry evaluation of the integrals for second and fourth moments 2 e x 2 and e x 4 can be done given 3 and the normal integral then e x 2 1 1 c 1 2 1 6 0 0 05 0 1 0 15 0 2 0 25 0 3 0 35 0 4

closed form in terms of special functions chaudhry et al 1996 it would however be easier and probably much quicker to evaluate the integral numerically 3 3 distribution function this cannot be written in closed form but must be obtained by integrating 3 a useful result follows from reversing the order of the integrations over x and z then we have that the distribution function f x is given by f x 1 2 1 2 1 zx exp z 2 2 dz 8 this form is arguably less convenient for numerical quadrature but when x 1 1 2 the integral can be done to give the results f 1 1 2 1 2 f 1 1 2 2 these results assist numerical integration which can now be done over a smaller range 3 4 random numbers these can be generated in several ways using the rejection method a simple and fairly efficient method is to generate a random variable x from a normal distribution to generate z from a truncated normal distribution and then to set x x 1 z robert 1995 used an exponential majorizing distribution in a rejection method to generate random numbers from the truncated normal distribution for completeness the full method including his algorithm is given here 1 set 4 2 2 generate u v uniformly distributed random numbers 3 generate the shifted exponential random variable z ln u 4 compute exp z 2 2 5 if v restart from step 2 6 generate x a normally distributed random number 7 return the random number as x 1 z 3 5 estimation with y observed where y s x the pdf of y is f y c 1 s exp y 2 2 s 2 1 1 y 2 s 2 4 write di 1 1 yi s 2 then on making n observations y 1 yn the log likelihood is n ln c 1 n ln s 2

derivatives are 2 2 n s 2 2 1 s 2 2 1 s 2 n i 1 yi 2 d 2 i n i 1 1 di 2 s 2 s 3 n i 1 yi 4 1 s 3 n i 1 yi di 4 1 2 s 5 n i 1 yi 3 d 2 i 2 1 s 2 n i 1 yi 2 s 2 n i 1 yi di 2 1 s 4 n i 1 yi 3 d 2 i 2 s

instance where the nc 1 distribution is more tractable than the t distribution because differentiating the corresponding constant for the t distribution would require the computation of the psi digamma function 3 6 nc n distributions for distributions of the form f x cn exp x 2 2 1 x 2 n 6 for integer n the constant cn can be found analytically such distributions can be useful in fitting e g financial data and so the derivation of the constant cn is outlined the generalizing function g z is taken as g z dn z 2 n 1 exp z 2 2 11 for z this is chosen to give an integral of form 6 then f x dn 1 2 z exp 1 x 2 z 2 2 z 2 n 1 dz 2 dn 2 n 1 n 1 exp 2 2 2 exp x 2 2 1 x 2 n 7 where the last result follows on integrating by parts n times it remains to find the constant dn where d 1 n in z 2 n 1 exp z 2 2 dz using integration by parts yet again on g z we obtain i 1 2 i 2 exp 2 1 2 then for n 2 integration by parts gives the recurrence relation in 2 n 3 in 1 2 n 2 in 2 hence it is possible to find the constants cn from dn i 1 n and 7 and fit these distributions to data the corresponding number of degrees of freedom is 2 n 1 again x x 1 for practical use random numbers can be generated from the pdf f x 1 cn exp x 2 2 1 1 x 2 n using the rejection method by generating a random number from the t 2 n 1 distribution rescaling it and accepting it with probability exp x 2 2 in detail 1 generate a random number y from the t 2 n 1 distribution e g using the method of bailey 1994 2 rescale to x y 2 n 1 1 3 generate a uniform random number u and accept if u exp x 2 2 else return to step 1 this algorithm can also be used for the nc 1 distribution timing tests showed that for the nc 1 distribution the random number algorithm given specifically for that distribution took only 54 2 as much time as the general algorithm here this was based on a range of values of from 0 01 to 0 99 12 3 7 the nc 2 distribution this distribution cannot attain the cauchy like tails of the nc 1 distri bution but has proved useful in fitting the datasets described later even financial datasets are not as long tailed as the cauchy the pdf is f x 1 c 2 exp x 2 2 1 1 x 2 2 with c 2 defined as in the previous section i e c 2 2 2 2 1 exp 2 the first two even moments can be easily derived and are e x 2 1 1 c 2 c 1 1 e x 4 1 2 1 2 c 2 c 1 1 3 2 2 c 2 the excess kurtosis as a function of is shown in figure 3 note that as 0 the kurtosis is infinite for nc 1 and nc 2 distributions random numbers can be generated as previously described for the nc n distribution 4 fits to data the fitting was done using a purpose written fortran program and using the nag library function minimizers and quadrature routines derivatives were not required by the gradient based function minimisers used and iden tical results were obtained with different minimisers the model parameters were the mean scale factor s and tail parameters and or iteration converged with no problem using the sample mean and standard deviation as starting values for s and starting estimates of at middle of the range values e g 0 2 5 however random restarts were made by perturbing the parameter values from their fitted values and re minimising to check that the global maximum of the log likelihood had been attained several publicly available datasets were fitted there is little point show ing histograms with the fitted model as the fits are visually very similar to that of the t distribution as can be seen from figure 2 first the heights in centimetres of 100 female athletes from cook and weisberg 1994 next the 1080 monthly average heights of the rio negro river at manaus stern berg 1987 the 10939 logged returns on the s p 500 index to 20 may 13 2021 the 9013 logged returns on the ftse 100 to 8 april 2021 and the 13863 logged returns on the nikkei to 20 may 2021 the first two datasets are physical measurements and the last three are financial it is known that day to day returns are not independent so a better fit to data can be obtained by modelling this dependence but this was ignored here for simplicity results from fitting the t nc 1 nc 2 and n t distributions are shown in table 1 the

two and normal t distribution not shown all distributions except the n t have 3 parameters and so log likelihoods can be compared the n t distribution has 4 parameters overall the nc 1 distribution fits comparably with the t distribution sometimes better and sometimes worse better for the height of athletes data 14 and the nikkei the nc 2 distribution fits better than the t distribution in 4 out of the 5 cases the n t distribution generalizes the t distribution and so must always fit better in the sense that the log likelihood will be higher the improvement is large for the nikkei where the log likelihood increases by over 24 the large size of the dataset enables small differences in fit to be detected because is somewhat lower for the n t fit it seems that the nikkei returns favour a very long tailed distribution but one where the tails do eventually attenuate it is clear that the n t distribution gives a significantly better fit than the t distribution so that x 2 1 48 14 the aim here was to show noninferiority i e that the nc n distribu tions could data comparably to the t distribution sometimes slightly better and sometimes slightly worse this is the case here the tentative con clusion is the nc 2 distribution may be more useful in practice than the nc 1 distribution although it does not allow such extreme tail behaviour it is better at modelling the less extreme tail behaviour that usually oc curs however the nc 1 distribution allows extreme tail behaviour and will always be adequate it is interesting to examine the excess kurtosis of the three financial indices where with the t distribution the predicted kurtosis would be infi nite data were divided into 10 tranches and randomized to obtain sample estimates while predictions pred were made from the fitted n t model the results were s p 500 19 42 9 04 pred 14 87 ftse 100 9 32 1 60 pred 12 68 nikkei 8 055 2 11 pred 6 33 this shows that the predicted kurtoses are in fair agreement with the sample kurtoses confirming that the new models give a better description of the data than the t distribution 5 conclusions a class of fat tailed distributions that are normal in the extreme tails has been described with a number of generalizations and related distributions figure 2 shows the nc 1 distribution to be very similar in shape to the t distribution except in the extreme tails and it has been demonstrated to fit datasets very comparably to the t distribution the data fitting led to the recognition that the nc 2 distribution also looks promising for practical work as it fitted 4 out of 5 datasets better than the t distribution compared to the t distribution the computation of the pdf is of compa rable difficulty both requiring special functions for the normalization con stant moments are simply computed just being somewhat messier than 15 those of the t distribution the moment generating function also exists and can be found as an integral random numbers can be easily generated which is vital for many computations e g markov chain monte carlo the distribution function must be found by numerical quadrature whereas for the t distribution it is available as a special function the incomplete beta function one might ask given that we have the t distribution why we should be interested in a similar distribution where the computations are slightly more complex there are at least three reasons firstly from the arguments given in the introduction we expect that these distributions will model real world behaviour better in the extreme tails which could be useful for predicting the probability of extreme events secondly for sensitivity analysis to check robustness of results to model assumptions we can repeat our analysis with the nc 1 distribution replac ing the t distribution and we should still reach similar conclusions thirdly an advantage of the nc 1 distribution as a replacement for the t distribution is that all the moments and the moment generating function exist this has two benefits one is that the method of moments can be used to find good starting values for a maximum likelihood fit to the data e g by using figure 3 the main benefit however is for cases where the mean of the exponent of the random variable must be computed this happens with long tailed data such as financial return data where logarithms have been taken and the distribution is still long tailed the mean of the exponent then gives the mean of the returns themselves this situation also occurs where for example bmi body mass index or other medical statistics might be fitted by taking logarithms it will be the mean and variance of bmi itself not its logarithm that are ultimately required future work in this area could be gaining experience on fitting the dis tribution 3 in different application areas and investigating further related distributions random number generation is a practically useful topic and the generation schemes given here could doubtless be honed appendix a a multivariate distribution 5 1 multivariate distributions writing a x tv 1 x where is the mean and v the covariance matrix of the normal distribution and with all variances scaled by z 2 as 16 before the p dimensional pdf becomes f x 1 2 p 2 v 1 2 1 2 zp exp 1 a 2 g z dz to obtain the desired pdf take g z cz exp z 2 2 zp 1 then for p 2 the bivariate case g z cz exp z 2 2 z and cz 2 e 1 2 the required pdf is therefore f x 1 v 1 2 e 1 2 exp 1 a 2 1 a for the trivariate case g z cz exp z 2 2 z 2 and the constant is c cz 2 3 2 v 1 2 where cz 1 exp 2 2 in general takingv z 2 as the covariance matrix of a normal distribution the covariance matrix is vcz 1 2 exp z 2 2 dz zp 1 by parts v czp exp 2 p 2 1 appendix b other cases 5 2 a blurred t distribution with zero degrees of freedom when 1 2 a different distribution is obtained the modified bessel function of the second kind can be written as k z z 2 1 2 0 exp z cosh t sinh 2 t dt setting 0 x sinh t 2 z 4 we obtain the pdf f x exp 4 k 0 4 exp x 2 2 1 x 2 this gave similar fits to 2 for the datasets fitted here but is less tractable moments can be computed in terms of the bessel functions k 1 k 2 etc 17 5 3 asymmetric distributions to introduce asymmetry to the nc 1 distribution a simple method is to use a 2 piece distribution f x 2 k s 1 s 2 exp x 2 2 s 2 1 1 1 x 2 s 2 1 if x 2 k s 1 s 2 exp x 2 2 s 2 2 1 1 x 2 s 2 2 if x where s 1 s 2 are scale factors the pdf of this type of distribution and its first derivative are continuous at x the mean can be shown to be e x k s 2 s 1 exp 2 1 e 1 2 1 2 1 where e 1 is the exponential integral e 1 z z exp t dt t for 0 even moments about are simply derived e g the second moment is s 31 s 3 2 s 1 s 2 times the second moment of 3 thus the moments can be derived in terms of special functions albeit messily the probability that x is s 1 s 1 s 2 so random numbers can be generated by finding which half of the range x lies in then proceeding as for the nc 1 distribution 5 4 survival distributions the two distributions used in this approach can of course be survival dis tributions defined for x 0 tebbens et al 2001 used a distribution cr exp ar to model
