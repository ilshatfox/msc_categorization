analytic settings the lack of free objects using a normed set and associated categories i describe constructions of normed objects which build from a set to a vector space to an algebra and thus parallel the natural progression found in alge braic settings each of these is characterized as a left adjoint functor to a natural forgetful functor further the universal property in each case yields a scaled free mapping property which extends previous notions of free normed objects in subsequent papers this scaled free property coupled with the as sociated functorial results will give rise to a presentation theory for banach algebras and other such objects which inherits many properties and constructions from its algebraic counterpart contents 1 introduction 1 2 normed sets revisited 2 2 1

well known in the literature of category theory and abstract algebra such as resources 3 and 10 however as is well known free objects rarely exist in categories of normed objects over f r c key words and phrases banach space banach algebra adjoint functor free construction 1 http arxiv org abs 1011 0717 v 3 2 will grilliette to summarize in the terminology and notation of this paper let c be a subcategory of normed f vector spaces with f linear contractions there is a natural forgetful functor fc c set which strips all algebraic and topological data leaving only the underlying sets and set maps the free mapping property can be stated as a reflection along the functor fc explicitly given a set s a reflection of s along fc is an object v of c and a function s fcv such that given any other object w of c and a function s fcw there is a unique c map v w such that fc proposition 1 1 folklore fix a nonempty set s if c contains an object not isomorphic to the zero space then s has no reflection along fc since the free mapping property is a cornerstone to many constructions in pure algebra particularly presentation theory this is a most discouraging fact the necessity of making some sacrifice has spawned several avenues of research into generators and relations such as 2 4 5 12 13 14 15 the present work develops the same category of normed sets with con tractive maps from 4 p 19 but also generalizes to bounded maps and identifies the properties of both using these categories the present work builds banach spaces and banach algebras with the analogous universal property further the constructions generalize the work of 5 14 15 and it is this scaled free mapping property that is of interest in subsequent papers this scaled free property coupled with the associated functorial results will give rise to a presentation theory for banach algebras and other such objects which inherits many properties and constructions from its algebraic counterpart the author would like to thank the referees of this paper for their com ments and patience in its revision he would also like to thank prof david pitts for his advice and help in developing these ideas 2 normed sets revisited this section defines an alternative working environment apart from the category of sets and explores the basic principles governing it this category was previously introduced in 4 p 19 in the context of constructing c algebras and 6 p 7 for combinatorial homology 2 1 definitions basic results the objective is to construct a cate gory so that a forgetful functor from a category of normed objects and its homomorphisms will have a left adjoint explicitly the objects will be a set with a sizing function definition a normed set is a pair s f where s is a set and f a function from s to 0 the function f is called the norm function this structure is not new previously considered in 4 p 19 and 6 p 7 though the latter allows the use of as a norm value this has significant scaled free objects 3 impact on the structure of the associated category as will be explained in section 2 2 as the author was initially unaware of the previous two references he used the term crutched set and crutch function in his original dissertation 7 p 14 definition given two normed sets s f and t g a function s t is bounded if there is m 0 such that for all s s g s mf s let crh inf m 0 g s mf s s s the bound constant of if crh 1 is contractive the contractive notion was also visited in 4 p 19 and 6 p 7 the author used the terms crutch bound and constrictive in his original dissertation 7 p 15 with these notions adaptations of the standard functional analysis proofs can be used to prove the following foundational results proposition 2 1 1 boundedness criterion let s f and t g be normed sets a function s t is bounded if and only if sup g s f s s 6 f 1 0 0 and g s 0 for all s f 1 0 in this case crh equals the above supremum and g s crh f s for all s s corollary 2 1 2 composition let s f t g and u h be normed sets and s f t g and t g u h be bounded then s u is bounded and crh crh crh if and are contractive so is 2 2 category of normed sets contractive maps next a detailed study is conducted of normed sets and contractive functions between them this combination of objects and maps was considered previously in 4 for notation let cset 1 denote the category of normed sets with contractive maps with this new structure defined one considers some of its basic prop erties and constructions most of these are identical the set case though most interestingly the norm function in each case immediately resembles its counterpart in normed structures the following proposition characterizes the standard types of morphisms for cset 1 isomorphisms were mentioned briefly in 6 p 7 also this proposition adds precision to 4 remark 1 1 9 in regard to sections and retractions the proofs are nearly identical to the set theoretic versions and will be omitted 4 will grilliette proposition 2 2 1 let s f and t g be normed sets and s f t g be contractive the following characterizations hold 1 is a monomorphism in cset 1 iff is one to one 2 is an epimorphism in cset 1 iff is onto 3 is a section in cset 1 iff is one to one g f and for all t 6 s there is st s such that f st g t 4 is a retraction in cset 1 iff for all t t there is st s such that st t and f st g t 5 is an isomorphism in cset 1 iff is one to one onto and g f the construction of the equalizer and coequalizer of parallel maps are the same as mentioned in 6 p 7 characterizing substructures and quotients respectively likewise a small coproduct is identical to the characteriza tion in 6 and it gives a standard decomposition of any normed set as a coproduct of singletons however unlike 6 exclusion of as a norm value changes the product structure proposition 2 2 2 products for an index set i let si fi be normed sets for i i define p s set i i i si s i si i i sup fi s i i i f p 0 by f s sup fi s i i i and i p si by i s s i then p f equipped with i i i is a product of si fi i i in cset 1 since is not allowed any sequence of elements whose norm values would be unbounded must be excluded the proof is akin to the product charac terization for the category of banach spaces with contractive maps this difference in the construction of the product forebodes a difference between cset 1 and the category of 6 indeed these two categories are not equivalent which can be shown by counting their projective objects from 6 let nset denote the category of normed sets and contractive maps which allow like set any set equipped with the constant norm is projective with respect to all epimorphisms however disallowing in cset 1 almost completely forbids this behavior proposition 2 2 3 let s f be a normed set 1 s f is projective relative to all epimorphisms in cset 1 iff s 2 s f is injective relative to all monomorphisms in cset 1 iff s 6 and f 0 proof 1 the empty set equipped with the empty function to 0 is initial in cset 1 hence it is trivially projective with respect to any class of maps scaled free objects 5 for purposes of contradiction assume that s 6 and s f is projective relative to all epimorphisms for each n n define g hn s 0 by g s 0 and hn s n also let n s s by s n s s then consider the following diagram in cset 1 for each n s hn n s f s g since n is onto and s f projective to epimorphisms there must be a contractive n s f s hn such that n n then for each s s and n n s s n s n s and n hn n s f s thus f cannot have a finite value contradicting that s f was in cset 1 2 assume that s f is injective relative to all monomorphisms let 0 s s and 0 0 0 be the empty functions into s and 0 respectively consider the following diagram in cset 1 s f oo 0 s 0 0 0 0 0 0 as s f is injective relative to 0 0 there must be a contractive map from 0 0 to s f hence there is a function from a nonempty set into s forcing s 6 define h s 0 by h s 0 also let s s by s s s then consider the following diagram in cset 1 s f oo s f s h then there is a contraction s h s f such that then for each s s s s s s 6 will grilliette and 0 f s f s h s 0 assume that f 0 and s 6 let t g and u h be normed sets and t g u h be a monomorphism define u ran and observe that u is bijective given any t s choose any s 0 s and define u s by u s u s s 0 u 6 u as is one to one this is a well defined function by design and since f 0 is trivially contractive there is precisely one isomorphism class of a projective object relative to all epimorphisms in cset 1 but set and nset both have a proper class of such isomorphism classes hence the distinction follows corollary 2 2 4 cset 1 is equivalent to neither set nor nset as cate gories 2 3 category of normed sets bounded maps likewise normed sets and bounded functions between them denoted as cset can be stud ied comparing this structure to cset 1 at first glance cset is very similar to cset 1 and most of its constructions are identical however there are some notable distinctions between the two reminiscent of the dif ferences between considering banach spaces with bounded linear maps and contractive linear maps the standard types of morphisms are characterized much like in cset 1 but also similar to banach spaces and bounded maps in particular the notion of a section corresponds to the idea of bounded below proposition 2 3 1 let s f and t g be normed sets and s f t g be bounded define k t s h g k and inf g s f s s 6 f 1 0 1 is a monomorphism in cset iff is one to one 2 is an epimorphism in cset iff is onto 3 is a section in cset iff is one to one 0 and there is a bounded function k h s f 4 is a retraction in cset iff there are st t t s such that st t for all t t f st 0 for all t g 1 0 and sup f st g t t 6 g 1 0 0 5 is an isomorphism in cset iff is one to one onto and 0 scaled free objects 7 the equalizer and coequalizer of parallel maps is constructed as in cset 1 as are the product and coproduct for a finite index set however cset is neither complete nor cocomplete as a category the examples are similar the case of banach spaces and bounded maps where the supposed universal map would be forced to be unbounded example 2 3 2 for n n let sn 0 and fn sn 0 by fn the family sn fn n n does not have product in cset example 2 3 3 for n n define sn 0 and fn sn 0 by fn 0 1 the family sn fn n n does not have a coproduct in cset as such cset is a distinct category from the ones previously men tioned corollary 2 3 4 cset is equivalent as categories to neither set cset 1 nor nset 3 scaled free constructions this section concerns the construction of building normed algebraic ob jects specifically banach spaces and algebras from normed sets the main idea in each case is to build the appropriate free algebraic object on the set and then use the set s norm function to build the corresponding algebraic norm generalizing the constructions of 2 4 and 5 with the viewpoint of 14 the use of the norm function is analogous to the x norms in 9 but the universal objects created here are normed structures as opposed to a general topological ones 3 1 banach spaces let fban denote the category of f banach spaces with bounded f linear maps the forgetful functor fcset fban fban cset drops all of the linear structure given a normed set s f construction of a reflection along fcset fban would proceed along natural lines one builds an f vector space with basis s f 1 0 and completes in an appropriate universal norm however this construction is readily characterized as a weighted 1 space specifically let s s f 1 0 f p s 0 by f t s t f s and vs f 1 f s f define s f s f vs f by s f s 0 s f 1 0 s s 6 f 1 0 where s is the point mass at s s theorem 3 1 1 reflection characterization fban given an f banach space w and a bounded map s f fcset fban w there is a unique 8 will grilliette bounded f linear map vs f w such that f cset fban s f more over crh b vs f w proof define span s s s w on the standard basis by s s for all s s for any finite e s and scalars s s e s e s s w s e s s w s e s s w s e s crh f s crh s e s s vs f thus can be extended by continuity to vs f w by design f cset fban s f and uniqueness follows from the mapping of the basis vectors via s f by the norm computation above crh b vs f w and equality is achieved using the basis vectors further since s f was arbitrary the following functorial result is ob tained corollary 3 1 2 left adjoint functor fban there is a unique functor fbansp cset fban such that fbansp s f vs f which is left adjoint to f cset fban the numeric condition in theorem 3 1 1 actually shows that there is a second adjoint relationship here specifically consider the category of f banach spaces with contractive f linear maps denoted as fban 1 let f cset 1 fban 1 fban 1 cset 1 be the restriction of f cset fban to fban 1 corollary 3 1 3 left adjoint functor fban 1 there is a unique functor fbansp 1 cset 1 fban 1 such that fbansp 1 s f vs f which is left adjoint to f cset 1 fban 1 the universal property of theorem 3 1 1 seems very similar to the classi cal free mapping property but depends on the boundedness of maps how ever this can be somewhat negotiated at the cost of scalar multiplication scaled free objects 9 the following variation of theorem 3 1 1 is termed the scaled free mapping property which more closely mimics the classical free mapping property corollary 3 1 4 scaled free mapping property let s f be a normed set and w be an f banach space for any function s w there is a unique contractive f linear map fbansp 1 s f w such that for all s s s w s f s f s s this adjoint characterization should be compared to the well known unit ball functor explicitly the functor uf fban 1 set by associating a banach space with its closed unit ball and a contraction with its restriction to the unit ball as shown in 1 every set s has a reflection along this functor namely 1 f s however with the functor uf the norm has been hardcoded by the choice of the unit ball that is any element of s must be sent to an element of norm at most 1 the characterization presented here has allowed the norms of generators to vary preserving the numeric data in a function rather than the choice of a subset indeed the f in theorem 3 1 1 is fixed prior to construction but has no restriction otherwise in particular it need not be constant or bounded also the functors fcset fban and fcset 1 fban 1 only remove structure not altering the underlying set in any way this aspect seems to give a more natural forgetful feel like the classical situation of algebraic free objects theorem 3 1 1 states that the properties of the unit ball functor are re covered and extended to the case of bounded f linear maps arguably one can choose to scale all generators to norm 1 but in some cases it may be preferable to let individual generators have different norm values 3 2 banach algebras let fbanalg denote the category of f banach algebras with bounded f algebra homomorphisms the forgetful functor f cset fbanalg fbanalg cset drops all of the algebraic structure as in the previous section one would like to build a reflection along this forgetful functor for any given normed set however due to the introduction of multiplication this is not possible except in trivial cases proposition 3 2 1 a normed set s f has a reflection along fcset fbanalg if and only if s f 1 0 in this case the reflection is the zero algebra equipped with the constant map from s f proof this case is an exercise assume that s 6 f 1 0 for purposes of contradiction as sume that there is an f banach algebra r equipped with a bounded map s f fcset fbanalg r such that for any f banach algebra a and 10 will grilliette bounded map s f fcset fbanalg a there is a unique bounded f algebra homomorphism r a satisfying fcset fbanalg let rs s for all s s define s f by s f s the norm function itself then crh 1 so there is a unique bounded f algebra homomorphism r f such that for all s s f s s b r f rs r b r f crh f s since and are bounded for s 6 f 1 0 a division yields 1 b r f crh forcing crh 6 0 define s f by s 2 crh f s notice that crh 2 crh so there is a unique bounded f algebra homomorphism r f such that for n n rns rs n s n 2 n crh nf s n and rns b r f rns r b r f rs n r b r f crh nf s n combining these for s 6 f 1 0 a division yields 2 n b r f contradicting that was bounded this is initially discouraging like proposition 1 1 however observe that the cause of the failure here was the ability to send a generator to a value potentially larger than its norm value this coupled with the multiplicative structure forced the norm of the fictional universal map to grow without bound this behavior is disallowed in the contractive case where the scaled free construction works perfectly well to see this consider the category of f banach algebras with contractive f algebra homomorphisms denoted as fbanalg 1 there is a natural forgetful functor f cset 1 fbanalg 1 fbanalg 1 cset 1 by dropping all of the algebraic properties leaving only the norm functions and the contractivity of the maps for a normed set s f construction of a reflection along f cset 1 fbanalg 1 would proceed along natural lines one builds a free f algebra on s f 1 0 and completes in an appropriate universal norm however this construction can be realized in another way from theorem 3 1 1 a universal f banach space scaled free objects 11 can be created from s f in 11 satz 1 a universal f banach algebra can be created from this space the banach tensor algebra to make this explicit let f fban 1 fbanalg 1 fbanalg 1 fban 1 be the nat ural forgetful functor given by dropping only the multiplicative properties given an f banach space v the construction of 11 forms the 1 direct sum of projective tensor powers of v t 1 v 1 v n equipped with multiplication by the canonical isomorphism v n v m v m n letting v v t 1 v be the inclusion map into the first tensor power of v in t 1 v the following is a restatement of 11 satz 1 in the notation of the current paper theorem 3 2 2 satz 1 11 given an f banach algebra a and a con tractive linear v f fban 1 fbanalg 1 a there is a unique contractive f algebra homomorphism t 1 v a such that f fban 1 fbanalg 1 v this gives an associated functorial result since v was arbitrary corollary 3 2 3 left adjoint functor from satz 1 11 there is a unique functor t 1 fban 1 fbanalg 1 defined on objects as above which is left adjoint to f fban 1 fbanalg 1 a quick check shows that f cset 1 fbanalg 1 f cset 1 fban 1 f fban 1 fbanalg 1 so one can invoke the closure of right adjoints on composition hence its left adjoint is given by fbanalg t 1 fbansp 1 letting s f vs f s f be the embedding of the generation set the universal property can be stated as follows theorem 3 2 4 reflection characterization fbanalg 1 given an f banach algebra a and a contractive map s f fcset 1 fbanalg 1 a there is a unique contractive f algebra homomorphism fbanalg s f a such that f cset 1 fbanalg 1 s f the characterization on objects becomes nearly immediate by use of 11 satz 1 with the disjoint union coproduct of 6 p 7 and the knowledge that left adjoints preserve coproducts given a normed set s f fbanalg s f fbanalg 1 s s fbanalg s f s fbanalg 1 s 6 f 1 0 t 1 f fbanalg 1 s 6 f 1 0 1 f n where 1 f n is equipped with the convolution product note that the co product in fbanalg 1 is the free product defined in 8 p 318 an analogous 12 will grilliette scaled free mapping property holds like corollary 3 1 4 but will be omitted for brevity as a consequence the adjoint characterization of corollary 3 1 2 and the failure in proposition 3 2 1 yield the following nonexistence result due to the closure of left adjoints on composition corollary 3 2 5 there cannot exist a functor which is left adjoint to the forgetful functor from fbanalg to fban that is there is no analog of the banach tensor algebra when using bounded homomorphisms 3 3 failure of hilbert spaces consider the category of f hilbert spaces and f linear contractions fhilb 1 let f cset 1 fhilb 1 fhilb 1 cset 1 be the restriction of fcset fban to fhilb 1 as in the previous failure cases most interesting normed sets cannot have a reflection along this functor proposition 3 3 1 a normed set s f has a reflection along f cset 1 fhilb 1 if and only if s has either no element or precisely one element of nonzero norm in these cases the reflections are the zero space and the field respec tively equipped with the norm function from s f to f proof this case is an exercise consider first when f c for purposes of contradiction assume that there is an c hilbert space r equipped with a contractive map s f fcset 1 chilb 1 r such that for any c hilbert space h and contractive map s f fcset 1 chilb 1 h there is a unique contractive c linear map r h satisfying fcset 1 chilb 1 let vs s for all s s first the norms of each generator are determined since is contractive vs r f s for all s s consider the function s c by s f s the norm function itself then crh 1 so there is a unique c linear contraction r c such that therefore for all s s vs r vs f s which forces equality next consider the inner product of two generators via the polarization identity for n n and s 6 t vs nvt r vs r vt r f s f t define s t n s c by s t n u f s u s nf t u t 0 otherwise scaled free objects 13 then crh s t n 1 so there is a unique c linear contraction s t n r c such that hence vs nvt r s t n vs nvt s t n vs n s t n vt f s n nf t f s f t forcing equality using the polarization identity vs vt r 1 4 3 n 0 n vs nvt r 1 4 3 n 0 n f s f t 0 thus vs s s is an orthogonal set in r using parseval s identity for s 6 t vs vt 2 r vs 2 r vt 2 r f s 2 f t 2 but vs vt 2 r f s f t 2 f s 2 2 f s f t f t 2 together these imply that if s 6 t f s f t 0 however for distinct s t 6 f 1 0 this is impossible therefore this reflection can never have existed the case for f r follows by considering the real version of the polar ization identity from the proof the issue here was due to the incompatibility of the universal property with parseval s identity the universal property imposes that the norm on the reflection be an 1 norm like the case of f banach spaces but this cannot happen in a f hilbert space other than f or o 14 will grilliette 4 universal algebra for normed objects after performing all the constructions of section 3 consider the following diagram of categories and functors falg fbanalg oo fbanalg 1 oo fvec ii fban oo fban 1 oo jj set hh cset oo ii cset 1 oo ii here falg and fvec denote the categories of f algebras with f algebra homomorphisms and f vector spaces with f linear maps respectively the solid lines represent the natural forgetful functor dropping the appropriate structure in each case the dotted arrows however represent the presence of a left adjoint func tor in the purely algebraic cases these are the free f vector space of a set and the tensor f algebra of an f vector space the normed cases are the constructions depicted in section 3 notice also that none of the horizontal functors have left adjoints since each lacks the necessary condition of pre serving categorical products likewise none of them preserve categorical coproducts so they cannot have right adjoints either viewing these categories and construction functors together shows the parallels between the algebraic and the functional analytic theory for al gebraic categories set plays a foundational role allowing consideration of objects with minimal structure from the constructions of section 3 and the properties found in section 2 cset 1 may play a similar role for normed objects a category of objects with structure similar to normed objects but minimal plans are to investigate these relationships in subsequent papers relying heavily on the foundation laid in this work in particular the intuitive con struction steps from section 3 building an algebraic object and competing in a universal norm can be repeated for many well known functional analytic objects operator spaces operator algebras c algebras etc however the failure result in proposition 3 3 1 warns that care should be taken as the universal property can interfere with the norm structure in adverse ways references 1 ji r ada mek horst herrlich and george
