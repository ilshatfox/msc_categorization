university las cruces nm 88003 1 introduction in a previous publication 6 a definition of loday s leibniz cohomology hl 5 was proposed for differentiable manifolds in particular every k tensor from classical differential geometry is a cochain in the leibniz complex although the leibniz coboundary d is not necessarily a k 1 tensor d remains a local operator on vector fields with the value of d at a point p in the manifold m determined by the values of in an arbitrary open neighborhood containing p with this writing we offer an explicit formula for d in a local coordinate chart and provide a geometric interpretation of d in terms of the calculus of variations if is the metric two tensor on a riemannian manifold then the local expression for d involves the christoffel symbols while the global definition of d reduces to the first variation formula for arc length more generally the leibniz coboundary of any two tensor can be written in terms of the necessary conditions to achieve a minimum or maximum value of over a locally immersed curve or surface the paper closes with the computation of the leibniz coboundary of the riemann curvature tensor r in terms of its covariant derivative r section two of the paper begins with a brief recollection of hl for a dif ferentiable manifold m and proceeds with the foundational material needed to prove that d is a local operator section three contains the results for two tensors and the calculus of variations the final section provides the local 1 http arxiv org abs math 9808036 v 1 coboundary formula for arbitrary k tensors as well as the global cobound ary of the riemann curvature tensor for more background material about hl m and in particular calculations of hl for euclidean n space which are highly non trivial see 6 for more information about leibniz homology and cohomology see 3 4 5 2 the leibniz coboundary as a local operator we begin by reviewing the definition of leibniz cohomology for differentiable manifolds 6 and show that the leibniz coboundary of a k tensor d is a local operator i e d at p m is determined by the value of on an arbitrary open neighborhood of p m this permits in later sections the formulation of d in terms of a local coordinate chart let m be a differentiable c manifold of dimension n m the lie algebra of c vector fields on m and c m the algebra of c real valued functions f m r recall that c m is a left representation of m via m r c m c m x f 7 x f where x f is the lie derivative of f c m in the direction x m let ck m homc r m k c m k 0 denote the r vector space of continuous homomorphisms m k c m in the strong c topology see 2 for a discussion of this topology then the leibniz cohomology of m with coefficients in c m written hl m c m is the homology of the cochain complex c 0 m c 1 m ck m d ck 1 m 2 where d x 1 x 2 xk 1 k 1 i 1 1 i 1 xi x 1 x i xk 1 1 i j k 1 1 j 1 x 1 xi 1 xi xj xi 1 x j xk 1 2 1 let be a k tensor on m i e m t m k is a c section of the k fold tensor product of the cotangent bundle then determines an element of homc r m k c m via x 1 x 2 xk m r x 1 x 2 xk p x 1 p x 2 p xk p although d is not necessarily a k 1 tensor 6 the following local result remains valid lemma 2 1 let be a k tensor on m and o m open if x 1 x 2 xk 1 y 1 yk 1 m with xi yi i 1 2 k 1 on o then d x 1 xk 1 p d y 1 yk 1 p for all p o proof since the lie bracket at p xi xj p is determined by the values of xi and xj on an open set containing p we have xi xj p yi yj p p o 3 also the lie derivative of a function f m r at p is determined by the values of f on an open set containing p thus xi x 1 x i xk 1 p yi y 1 y i yk 1 p p o let x u rn be a coordinate chart for m p u fixed with x p 0 rn if x 1 xk 1 are c vector fields on u we may define d x 1 xk 1 p for a k tensor as follows let g rn r be a c function with g v 1 v 1 0 v 2 then g x u r is c and may be extended to a c function m r via q 0 q m u g x q q u define c vector fields yi on m by setting yi xi on u and yi 0 on m u clearly yi xi on o x 1 v rn v 1 set d x 1 xk 1 p d y 1 yk 1 p 2 2 by lemma 2 1 the value of d x 1 xk 1 p is independent of the choice of g rn r the formula in equation 2 2 is useful for the construction of the leibinz coboundary of a tensor in local coordinate chart 4 3 two tensors and the calculus of variations in this section we compute the leibniz coboundary of a two tensor in terms of the local coordinate chart x u where u m is open and x u rn is a homeomorphism belonging to the atlas of charts for the differentiable structure of m the coefficients of this coboundary can be identified with those which occur in the optimization process for the integral of a two tensor over an immersed curve or surface within u for example the leibniz coboundary of the metric two tensor for m riemannian can be expressed in terms of the christoffel symbols for completeness we begin with a one form i e a one tensor which has a local expression on u as n i 1 ai dx i where ai u r are c functions from equation 2 1 the leibniz coboundary of agrees with the de rham coboundary of and in local coordinates d n i j 1 ai xj dxj dxi j i ai xj aj xi dxj dxi 3 1 we now discuss in what sense the functions ai xj aj xi arise from the calculus of variations let 0 1 u 0 p 1 q be a c curve with a c variation 0 1 u 5 satisfying 0 t t s 0 p for s s 1 q for s we wish to investigate to what extent j 1 0 d dt dt is an extreme value as a function of s of j s 1 0 t s t dt let i xi t r be the i th component of the curve t then d dt n i 1 d i dt xi t d dt n i 1 ai t d i dt 1 0 d dt dt 1 0 n i 1 ai t d i dt dt recalling the treatment of the calculus of variations 9 p 438 we define f rn rn r by f x y n i 1 ai x y i where y y 1 y 2 yn in our case ai x ai x 1 x t and yi d i dt a necessary condition that j be an extreme value is that the euler lagrange equations hold 9 p 438 f x d dt f y 1 2 n 3 2 6 now f x t d dt n i 1 ai x t d i dt f y t d dt a t d dt a t n j 1 a xj t d j dt the condition in equation 3 2 may be rewritten as n i 1 ai x a xi t d i dt 0 3 3 for each 1 2 3 n the coefficients arising in 3 3 also appear in 3 1 of course d n i 1 d i dt x t xi t n i 1 ai x a xi t d i dt we now prove an identical result for the leibniz coboundary of a two tensor which is not necessarily a two form let be a two tensor on m with local expression n i j 1 aij dx i dxj on u let i 2 u be an immersion c is sufficient where i 2 t 1 t 2 r 2 0 t 1 1 0 t 2 1 although the value of the integral j 1 0 1 0 t 1 t 2 dt 1 dt 2 3 4 7 generally depends on the parameterization and not just the image of necessary conditions for an extreme value of j can still be sought consider the c variation i 2 u satisfying 0 t 1 t 2 t 1 t 2 s 1 t 2 1 t 2 s 0 t 2 0 t 2 s s t 1 1 t 1 1 s t 1 0 t 1 0 s then as a

r lemma 3 1 a necessary condition that j in equation 3 4 be an ex treme value for the variation j s is that n i j 1 aij x a j xi ai xj t 1 t 2 i t 1 j t 2 n j 1 a j aj t 1 t 2 2 j t 1 t 2 0 for each 1 2 3 n proof one computes d j s ds directly and equates d j s ds s 0 0 8 in the following aij and aij x are evaluated at s t 1 t 2 while all partial derivatives of the i s are evaluated at s t 1 t 2 then d j s ds 1 0 1 0 n i j 1 n 1 aij x s i t 1 j t 2 n i j 1 aij 2 i s t 1 j t 2 n i j 1 aij i t 1 2 j s t 2 dt 1 dt 2 which can be simplified using intergration by parts and in certain terms the boundary values of for example 1 0 1 0 aij 2 i s t 1 j t 2 dt 1 dt 2 i ii i 1 0 aij i s j t 2 t 1 1 t 1 0 dt 2 0 ii 1 0 1 0 n k 1 aij xk k t 1 i s j t 2 aij i s 2 j t 1 t 2 dt 1 dt 2 after reindexing d j s ds s 0 n 1 1 0 1 0 s n i j 1 aij x a j xi ai xj i t 1 j t 2 n j 1 a j aj 2 j t 1 t 2 dt 1 dt 2 where aij and aij x are evaluated at t 1 t 2 and s is evaluated at 0 t 1 t 2 the lemma now follows from the standard techniques of the calculus of vari ations for example 9 p 432 438 and in particular 9 p 435 recall that the symbols x 1 x 2 xn 9 may be interpreted as vector fields on u as well as derivations of the ring c u to state the next lemma we introduce the composition operators x dxp u c u given by x dxp n i 1 ai xi ap x lemma 3 2 let be a two tensor on m with local expression on u n p q 1 apq dx p dxq where each apq u r is c then d n p q 1 n 1 apq x dx dxp dxq n 1 apq x dxp dx dxq n 1 apq x dxp dxq dx n 1 apq dx dxp x dxq n 1 apq dx dxq x dxp proof let x 1 x 2 x 3 m with local expressions x 1 n i 1 1 ci 1 xi 1 x 2 n i 2 1 ci 2 xi 2 x 3 n i 3 1 ci 3 xi 3 then d x 1 x 2 x 3 n i 1 i 2 i 3 1 d ci 1 xi 1 ci 2 xi 2 ci 3 xi 3 10 and from equation 2 1 d ci 1 xi 1 ci 2 xi 2 ci 3 xi

same result is obtained thus given n p q 1 apq dx p dxq we have d xi x xj a j xi aij x ai xj 3 6 although d is c m linear in the first two tensor factors this is not the case for the third factor d xi x c xj c a j xi aij x ai xj aj a j c xi 3 7 the coefficients of d appearing in equation 3 7 are the same as those in lemma 3 1 lemma 3 3 let m be a riemannian manifold with metric tensor n p q 1 gpq dx p dxq gpq gqp which is compatible with the levi civita connection then i d xi x xj 2 ij twice the christoffel symbol ii d x y z 2 y xz for x y z m 11 proof part i follows from equation 3 6 and the definition of the christoffel symbols of the first kind ij 1 2 gj xi gi xj gij x for part ii recall that since is compatible with the metric tensor 1 p 54 we have x y z xy z y xz since the levi civita connection is symmetric i e torsion free 1 p 54 55 10 p 255 256 we have x y x y y x the lemma now follows from 2 1 i e d x y z x y z y x z z x y x y z x z y x y z thus the obstruction to c m linearity of the leibniz coboundary in lemma 3 3 is the failure of the connection to be c m linear in its second argument also the first variation of arc length of i u can be recovered as 1 2 d d dt y d dt y d dt d dt where y is a vector field which represents the variation of the curve a necessary condition that be a geodesic is that d d dt y d dt 0 for all y since d dt d dt must vanish along such curves the only two tensors which are global cocycles however must be two forms lemma 3 4 let be a two tensor on m with d 0 in the lebiniz cochain complex then is a two form 12 proof letting n p q 1 apq dx p dxq be a local expression for then d xi x xj 0 implies a j xi aij x ai xj 0 furthermore d xi x xi xj 0 and 3 7 imply that aj a j thus is skew symmetric the leibniz coboundary of a k tensor agrees with the terms occurring in the optimization of the integral of if is skew symmetric in its last k 1 arguments such tensors naturally occur in the e 2 term of the pirashvili spectral sequence for leibniz cohomology 7 6 suppose that g is a lie algebra over r g hom g r the coadjoint representation of g and that h lie g g denotes the lie algebra cohomology of g with coefficients in g an element of hk 1 lie g g can be represented by a tensor g k r which is skew symmetric in its last k 1 tensor factors 6 moreover h lie g g occurs in the e 2 term of the pirashvili spectral sequence for hl g 4 the local coboundary formula let be a k tensor on m with local expression i ai dx i 1 dxi 2 dxik 4 1 where i is the multi index i 1 i 2 ik and the summation ranges over 0 i 1 n 0 i 2 n 0 ik n 13 to state the

dxi 3 dxik dxi 1 dxi 2 s dxi 3 dxik 1 k 2 dxi 1 dxik 2 s dxik 1 dxik proof the proof proceeds by induction on k with the case k 2 proven in lemma 3 2 to streamline the inductive step define a k 1 tensor often called a contraction by v 2 vk xj 1 v 2 vk where xj 1 is a fixed canonical vector field on a coordinate chart let z cj 1 xj 1 cj 2 xj 2 cj 3 xj 3 cjk 1 xjk 1 then d z cj 1 cj 2 cjk 1 xj 1

follows the result 15 lemma 4 2 if is a k tensor on an n dimensional differentiable manifold m k n 1 and d 0 then is a k form proof clearly d 0 for any m k 1 since d xj 1 xj 2 xjk 1 0 we have using
