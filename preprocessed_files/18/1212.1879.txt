rings we provide sufficient conditions to guarantee the additivity formula of higher algebraic k groups of the rings involved and establish a long mayer vietoris exact sequence of higher algebraic k groups for homological exact contexts introduced in the first paper of this series our results are then applied to recollements induced from homological ring epimorphisms and noncommutative localizations consequently we get an infinitely long mayer vietoris exact sequence of k theory for milnor squares re obtain a result of karoubi corollary 5 6 on localiza tions and a result on generalized free products pioneered by waldhausen and developed by neeman and ranicki in particular we describe algebraic k groups of the free product of two groups over a regular coherent ring as the ones of the noncommutative tensor product of an exact context this yields a new description of algebraic k theory of infinite dihedral group contents 1 introduction 1 2 preliminaries 6 2 1 general

hochschild homologies hhn and with cyclic homologies hc n of rings by chern characters on higher k theory see 31 chapter 6 for a survey in computation of higher algebraic k groups of rings quillen suslin and many others have made important contributions in the cases of finite fields algebraically closed fields and certain integral domains see 27 and the references in 31 for arbitrary rings however the question is too hard and remains little to be known though general abstract algebraic k theories have been explosively developed in the last a few decades in order to understand these algebraic k groups kn r for arbitrary rings r it is reasonable to investigate relationship between these k groups of different rings which are linked in certain nice ways along this direction are there some interesting and remarkable investigations in the literature for ex ample if two rings are derived equivalent then they have isomorphic kn groups by a result of dugger and shipley see 12 for a homological noncommutative localization r s of rings neeman and ranicki established a long exact sequence of algebraic k groups of r and s see 24 as an application of this result ranicki gave a new interpretation of waldhausen s result on algebraic k theory of generalized free products from the viewpoint of noncommutative localizations see 38 29 later krause relaxed noncommutative locations to homological ring epimorphisms with the property that the chain map lifting problem has a pos itive answer and established the same long exact sequence of k groups see 19 recently we show in 8 that for a homological ring epimorphism r s if the left r module s has a finite type resolution then kn r is the direct sum of kn s and kn r where r is a waldhausen category determined by this result is then applied to study algebraic k groups of endomorphism rings matrix subrings and rings with idempotent ideals see 8 for detail another useful type of natural linkages among rings is recollements of derived module categories which were introduced by beilinson bernstein and deligne in 1 for triangulated categories roughly speaking a recollement consists of three derived or triangulated categories linked by two triangle functors both of which have left and right adjoint functors the notion of recollements is an analogue of exact sequences for derived or triangulated categories which generalizes derived equivalences and is closely related to homological ring epimorphisms here a natural question is whether and when the additivity formula still holds true for algebraic k groups of rings involved in an arbitrary recollement of derived module categories namely we consider the following question question let r s and t be rings with identity suppose that there is a recollement among the derived module categories d t d r and d s of the rings t r and s d s d r ff xx d t ff xx when does the following additivity isomorphism hold true kn r kn s kn t for each n n where kn r always means the n th algebraic k group of the ring r this question may trace back to the work of berrick and keating on k theory of the matrix rings of 2 by 2 triangular matrices see 2 where they described the kn group of a triangular matrix ring as the direct sum of the ones of rings in the diagonal recently we show in 8 that if the ideal rer of a ring r generated by an idempotent element e has a special finite type resolution then the kn group of r is the direct sum of the ones of r rer and ere in both cases we do have recollements of derive module categories of rings and additivity formula of k groups however the isomorphism k 0 r k 0 s k 0 t does not have to hold for arbitrary recollements this can been seen by an example in 4 section 8 remark 2 so answers to the above question seem to be mysterious in this paper we shall apply representation theoretic methods to investigate the above question in detail and establish an additivity formula for higher algebraic k groups of rings involved in recollements with a 2 compactness condition thus we provide a general answer to the above question further we apply our result to homological ring epimorphisms exact contents extensions and free products of groups in dealing with the above mentioned question a number of technical obstacles occur to understand kn r one has to choose certain models of algebraic k theory space k r of r up to homotopy equivalence for example the usual favorite models are the category of finitely generated projective r modules see 26 31 8 the category of bounded complexes of finitely generated projective r modules see 37 19 23 24 33 and certain full subcategories of the category of complexes over r with countable direct sums see 24 12 when comparing algebraic k theory of different rings one has first to fix a suitable model to define k theory and then to find exact functors compatible with the chosen model unfortunately given an arbitrary recollement of derived module categories nothing is known about the concrete forms of the six triangle functors this means that it would be quite difficult to find a suitable model for all three rings in the recollement such that the given six functors can induce compatible functors on the model for all rings and connect k theory space k r with k spaces k s and k t in a reasonable way hence the methods used in 8 24 23 19 actually does not work any more for the present case and therefore some new ideas are necessary for attacking the above question to overcome these obstacles we pass to differential graded dg algebras and introduce a new defini tion of algebraic k theory spaces for dg algebras which captures the usual definition of algebraic k theory spaces of ordinary rings up to homotopy equivalence our definition of k theory spaces is a modification of schlichting s definition in 32 and excludes the potential set theoretic difficulties in the corresponding definition given by dugger and shipley in 12 also this new definition gives much freedom for choices of compatible functors among models that define k theory under a compactness assumption we can identify k s and k t with algebraic k theory spaces of dg endomorphism algebras s and t of perfect complexes over r respectively after a systematical study on homotopy equivalences of k theory spaces related to per fect dg modules we establish decomposition formulas for algebraic k groups of dg algebras particularly this leads to the following main result in this paper theorem 1 1 let r s and t be rings with identity suppose that there is a recollement among the derived module categories d t d r and d s of the rings t r and s d s i d r ff xx d t ff xx if i s is quasi isomorphic to a bounded complex of finitely generated projective r modules that is i s is compact in d r then kn r kn s kn t for all n n we remark that under the compactness condition in theorem 1 1 it is not difficult to prove that k 0 s is a direct summand of k 0 r however the key point here which seems to be highly non trivial is to prove that an additive complement to kn s is just kn t for all n 0 also we note that theorem 1 1 cannot be extended to dg algebras because derived equivalences of dg algebras do not preserve algebraic k groups as pointed out by an example in 12 first we apply theorem 1 1 to recollements of derived module categories arising from homological ring epimorphisms recall that a ring epimorphism r s is said to be homological if torrj s s 0 for all j 0 an r module m has a finite type resolution provided that there is a finite projective resolution by finitely generated projective r modules that is there is an exact sequence 0 pm p 1 p 0 m 0 for some m n such that all r modules pj are projective and finitely generated 3 corollary 1 2 suppose that r s is a homological ring epimorphism which induces a recollement of derived module categories of rings t r s d s i d r ff xx d t ff xx where i is the restriction functor induced from if rs or sr has a finite type resolution then kn r kn s kn t for all n n we should note that not every homological ring epimorphisms r s can induce a recollement of derived module categories of rings because the verdier quotient of d r by d s may not be realized as the derived category of a usual ring this can be seen by the counterexample given by bernhard keller to the telescope conjecture comparing corollary 1 2 with 8 theorem 1 1 we see that the conclusion of corollary 1 2 under the assumption of existence of a recollement is quite strong in fact by 8 theorem 1 1 we have kn r kn s kn r for all n n where kn r is the n th algebraic k group of the category r mentioned before while corollary 1 2 describes kn r explicitly as the kn group of a ring t if such a ring t exists moreover since stratifying ideals give rise to recollements of derived module categories corollary 1 2 also generalizes 8 corollary 1 3 next we consider k theory of reollements arising from exact contexts introduced in the first paper of this series see 6 this kind of recollements involves noncommutative localizations in ring theory which occur often in algebraic topology and representation theory see 28 29 let r s and t be associative rings with identity and let r s and r t be ring homomorphisms suppose that m is an s t bimodule together with an element m m the quadruple m m is called an exact context if the following sequence 0 r s t m m m 0 is an exact sequence of abelian groups where m and m denote the right and left multiplication by m maps respectively an exact context m m is called an exact pair if m s r t and m 1 1 in this case we simply say that is an exact pair the exact context m m is said to be homological if torri t s 0 for all i 1 for each exact context m m we associate it with a new ring t r s called the noncommutative tensor product of m m in 6 section 4 1 which is a generalization of the usual tensor products over commutative rings and captures coproducts of rings and dual extensions for a homological exact context m m we have the following long mayer vietoris sequence which links algebraic k groups of the rings r s t and t r s together theorem 1 3 let m m be a homological exact context then the following statements hold true 1 there exists a long exact sequence of algebraic k groups kn 1 t r s kn r kn kn kn s kn t kn kn kn t r s kn 1 r k 0 r k 0 s k 0 t k 0 t r s for all n n 2 if the left r module s or the right r module t has a finite type resolution then kn r kn t r s kn s kn t for all n n since a milnor square of rings provides a typical exact pair see 6 example 3 section 3 corollary 4 3 we have the following long mayer vietoris exact sequence which extends and amplifies the k theory sequence in 20 4 corollary 1 4 given a pullback square of rings and surjective homomorphisms r i 2 i 1 r 1 j 1 r 2 j 2 r if torrj r 2 r 1 0 for all j 0 then there is a long mayer vietoris exact sequence kn 1 r kn r kn r 1 kn r 2 kn r kn 1 r k 0 r k 0 r 1 k 0 r 2 k 0 r for all n n as another consequence of theorem 1 3 we obtain the following result on ring extensions corollary 1 5 suppose that r s is an extension of rings that is r is a subring of the ring s with the same identity let s be the endomorphism ring of the left r module s r if the left r module s is projective and finitely generated then kn r kn s r s kn s kn s for all n n where s r s is the noncommutative tensor product of an exact context defined by the extension a rather striking application of theorem 1 3 is that algebraic k groups of the free products of finite groups can be characterized by noncommutative tensor products which have finite ranks over ground rings while the group rings of free products usually have infinite ranks let h and g be two groups and let rh and rg be the group rings of h and g over a ring r respectively then the canonical maps from r to rh and rg can be completed into an exact context see section 5 2 for details and the associated noncommutative tensor product rh r rg can be described explicitly as follows as an abelian group rh r rg coincides with the group ring r h g of the direct product h g over r thus rh r rg is a finitely generated free r module if g and h are finite as an associative ring it admits the following multiplication r h g h g r and h g h g h gg hh g h g where r r h h h and g g g recall that the free product of h and g denoted by h g is the coproduct of h and g in the category of groups in general the free product of finite groups may be infinite for example the free product of two cyclic groups of order 2 is the infinite dihedral group d we say that a ring r is regular coherent if any finitely presented left r module has a finite type resolution a typical example of regular coherent rings is the ring of integers the following corollary follows from theorem 1 3 together with 38 theorems 1 and 4 which reduces surprisingly k theory of group rings of infinite r rank to the one of rings of finite r rank corollary 1 6 let r be a regular coherent ring and let h and g be two groups then kn r h g kn rh r rg kn rg r rh for all n 1 5 as a consequence of our methods we get a new description of algebraic k theory for infinite dihedral group d for an arbitrary ring r kn r d kn rz 2 r rz 2 n iln 1 r for n 1 where n iln r is the n th reduced nilgroup of r this decomposition is different from the result in 11 this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we briefly recall some definitions and basic facts on triangulated categories recollements and homological ring epimorphisms in section 3 we first recall the algebraic k theories developed by waldhausen for waldhausen categories and schlichting for frobenius pairs and then mention several fundamental theorems in algebraic k theory of frobenius pairs in section 4 we first introduce our definition of algebraic k theory spaces for differential graded algebras and then discuss homotopy equivalences of k theory spaces constructed from perfect dg modules in detail as a result we establish a reduction in proposition 4 14 for calculation of algebraic k groups of dg algebras at the end of this section we prove theorem 1 1 as well as corollary 1 2 in section 5 we apply our results to homological exact contexts and prove theorem 1 3 and corollaries 1 4 1 5 and 1 6 in the third paper of this series we shall discuss finitistic dimension theory for recollements of derived module categories of rings see 7 2 preliminaries in this section we shall fix notation employed throughout the paper and provide some basic facts for later proofs 2 1 general terminology and notation on categories let c be an additive category we always assume that a full subcategory b of c is closed under isomorphisms that is if x b and y c with y x then y b given two morphisms f x y and g y z in c we denote the composite of f and g by f g which is a morphism from x to z while given two functors f c d and g d e among three categories c d and e we denote the composite of f and g by gf which is a functor from c to e let ker f and im f be the kernel and image of the functor f respectively that is ker f x c fx 0 and im f y d x c fx y in particular ker f and im f are closed under isomorphisms in c and d respectively an additive functor f a b between two additive categories a and b is called an equivalence up to factors if f is fully faithful and each object of b is isomorphic to a direct summand of the image of an object of a under f let a be a triangulated category and x a full triangulated subcategory of a then due essentially to verdier there exists a triangulated category a x and a triangle functor q a a x with x ker q such that q has the following universal property if q a t is a triangle functor with x ker q then q factorizes uniquely through a q a x by 22 theorem 2 18 the category a x is called the verdier quotient of a by x and the functor q is called the verdier localization functor in this case ker q is the full subcategory of a consisting of direct summands of all objects in x see 22 chapter 2 for details we remark that the objects of the category a x are the same as the objects of a a sequence a f b g c of triangle functors f and g between triangulated categories is said to be exact if the following four conditions are satisfied i the functor f is fully faithful ii the composite gf a c of f and g is zero iii the image im f of f is equal to the kernel of g iv the functor g induces an equivalence from the verdier quotient of b by im f to c 6 clearly if x is closed under direct summands in a then we have an exact sequence of triangulated categories x a q a x let t be a triangulated category with small coproducts that is coproducts indexed over sets exist in t an object u t is said to be compact if homt u commutes with small coproducts in t the full subcategory of t consisting of all compact objects is denoted by t c for any non empty class s of objects in t we denote by tria s respectively thick s the smallest full triangulated subcategory of t containing s and being closed under small coproducts respectively direct summands if s consists of a single object u then we simply write tria u and thick u for tria u and thick u respectively the notation tria s without referring to t will not cause any confusions because this notation can be clarified from the contexts of our considerations the following facts are in the literature see 22 proposition 1 6 8 and 6 section 2 1 lemma 2 1 1 if t 0 is a full triangulated subcategory of t such that t 0 is closed under countable coprod ucts then t 0 is closed under direct summands in t 2 let t be a triangulated category with small coproducts and let f t t be a triangle functor if f preserves small coproducts then f tria u tria f u for any u t special examples of triangulated categories are the derived module categories of associative rings with identity which are of our particular interest in this paper now let us fix some notation for rings let r be a ring with identity we denote by r mod the category of all left r modules the complex homotopy and derived categories of r mod are usually denoted by c r k r and d r respectively it is well known that both k r and d r are triangulated categories and that d r tria rr as usual we write dc r for d r c which is equal to the full subcategory of d r consisting all those complexes that are quasi isomorphic to bounded complexes of finitely generated projective r modules 2 2 recollements and homological ring epimorphisms in this subsection we recall the notion of recollements introduced by beilinson bernstein and deligne see 1 which is widely used in algebraic geometry and representation theory some prominent examples of recollements can be constructed from certain homological ring epimorphisms let d d and d be triangulated categories with shift functors denoted universally by 1 we say that d is a recollement of d and d if there are six triangle functors indicated in the following diagram d i i d j j i i d j j such that 1 the 4 pairs i i i i j j and j j are adjoint pairs of functors 2 the 3 functors i j and j are fully faithful 3 the composite of two functors in each row is zero that is i j 0 and thus also j i 0 and i j 0 4 there are 2 canonical triangles in d for each object x d j j x x i i x j j x 1 i i x x j j x i i x 1 where j j x x and i i x x are counit adjunction maps and where x i i x and x j j x are unit adjunction maps 7 it is known that up to equivalence of categories recollements of triangulated categories are the same as torsion torsion free triples ttf triples of triangulated categories see for example 3 and 4 section 2 3 for details in the following lemma we mention some facts about recollements for later proofs lemma 2 2 suppose that the above recollement is given then the following hold a the images of the three fully faithful functors j i and j are closed under direct summands in d b the verdier quotients of d by the images of the triangle functors j and i are equivalent to d and d respectively c assume that d d and d admit small coproducts then both j and i preserve compact objects suppose further that d is compactly generated that is there is a set s of compact objects in d such that tria s d then i preserves compact objects if and only if so is j in this case we can obtain a half recollement of subcategories of compact objects d c i dc j i yy d c j yy note that a and b follow from 3 chapter i proposition 2 6 while c follows from 3 chapter iii lemma 1 2 1 and chapter iv proposition 1 11 a typical example of recollements occurs in the following two situations 1 recollements of derived module categories let r be a ring with an idempotent ideal i rer for e 2 e r suppose that i is a stratifying ideal of r that is the multiplication map re ere er rer is an isomorphism and tor ere j re er 0 for j 1 then there is a recollement of derived module categories d r i d d r er lr rhomr r i ee r i lr d ere re lere rhomere er ee where d is the restriction functor induced from the canonical surjection r r i and where re lere is the total left derived functor of re ere and rhomere er is the total right derived functor of homere er for more details we refer the reader to 10 in section 5 and 4 9 6 one may find more examples of recollements of derived module categories which have not to be induced from idempotent elements 2 recollements of triangulated categories induced from ring epimorphisms recall that a ring epimorphism r s is said to be homological if torrn s s 0 for all n 0 see 13 24 this is also equivalent to that the restriction functor d d s d r is fully faithful according to 25 section 4 for an arbitrary homological ring epimorphism we obtain the following recollement of triangulated categories of which the right hand term is not necessarily the derived category of an ordinary ring lemma 2 3 let r s be a homological ring epimorphism then there is a recollement of triangulated categories d s i d r j ff i xx tria rq gg j ww where q is the two term complex 0 r s 0 with r and s in degrees 0 and 1 respectively and where j is the canonical embedding and j q lr i s lr i d 8 thus if we define y y d r homd r x y 0 for any x tria rq then it follows from lemma 2 3 that y y d r homd r q y n 0 for n z y d r q lr y 0 and that i induces an equivalence d s y finally we point out that if a homological ring epimorphism induces a recollement of derived module categories of rings then it also gives a recollement of derived module categories of opposite rings though the categories d r and d r op for a ring r may not be triangle equivalent this fact will be used in the proof of corollary 1 2 lemma 2 4 let r s be a homological ring epimorphism then the following are equivalent for a ring t 1 there is a recollement of derived categories d s d d r ff xx d t ff xx 2 there is a recollement of derived categories d sop d d rop gg ww d t op gg ww proof observe that if r s is a homological ring epimorphism then so is the map rop sop by 13 theorem 4 4 moreover it follows from 25 corollary 3 4 that 1 holds if and only if there is a complex p c b r proj such that tria p tria rq endd r p t and homd r p p n 0 for any n 6 0 where q is the complex 0 r s 0 however for such a complex p we always have homd rop p p n homd r p p n for all n z where p homr p r c b rop proj so to prove that 1 and 2 are equivalent it is enough to prove the following statement if p c b r proj such that tria p tria rq then tria p tria q r in fact let p be such a complex and define y y d rop homd rop x y 0 for x tria p since p c b r proj we have p c b rop proj it follows from 4 lemma 2 8 that there is a recolle ment y d rop dd yy tria p gg ww where is the inclusion this implies that a tria p x d rop homd rop x y 0 for y y furthermore we remark that y y d rop homd rop p y n 0 for n z y d rop rhomrop p y 0 and that rhomrop p lr p d rop d z 9 by 6 section 2 1 thus y y d rop y lr p 0 however by lemma 2 1 2 for a given y d rop the left derived tensor functor y lr d r d z sends tria q respectively tria rp to zero if and only if y lr q 0 respectively y lr p 0 since tria p tria rq by assumption we certainly obtain y y d rop y lr q 0 since rop sop is a homological ring epimorphism we obtain another recollement by lemma 2 3 d sop d d rop g gg ww tria q r gg f ww where f is the inclusion and g is the tensor functor lr q this implies that im d ker g and b tria q r x d r op homd rop x y 0 for y ker g since y ker g we conclude from a and b that tria p tria q r this finishes the proof of lemma 2 4 3 algebraic k theory in this section first we briefly recall some basics on algebraic k theory of waldhausen categories and frobe nius pairs developed in 37 and 32 respectively and then we discuss algebraic k theory of differential graded algebras and prove a few facts as preparations for proofs of the main results 3 1 k theory spaces of small waldhausen categories let us first recall some elementary notion and facts about k theory of small waldhausen categories see 37 36 26 let c be a small waldhausen category that is a pointed category equipped with a zero object with cofibrations and weak equivalences in 37 section 1 3 waldhausen has defined a k theory space k c for c which is a pointed topological space and an n th homotopy group kn c of k c for each n n which is called the n th k group of c clearly if a waldhausen category c is essentially small that is the isomorphism classes of objects of c form a set then the definition of waldhausen k theory still makes sense for c because in this case one can choose a small waldhausen subcategory c of c such that c is equivalent to c and define the k theory of c through that of c note that k c is always homotopy equivalent to a cw complex in fact this follows from the following observation the classifying space of a small category has the structure of a connected cw complex and the loop space of a cw complex is homotopy equivalent to a cw complex see 21 while k c is the loop space of the classifying space constructed from c the k theory space defined by waldhausen is natural in the following sense each exact functor f c d between waldhausen categories c and d induces a continuous map k f k c k d of pointed topological spaces and a homomorphism kn f kn c kn d of abelian groups for each n n if g d e is another exact functor between waldhausen categories then k gf k f k g in our notation note that the associated point ec of k c corresponds to the image of the map k 0 k c induced from the inclusion 0 c where 0 denotes the zero object of c finally we recall some definitions and basic facts in homotopy theory for later proofs for more details we refer the reader to 40 chapters iii and iv and 34 chapter 7 those readers who are familiar with homotopy theory may skip the rest of this subsection let g y z be a continuous map of topological spaces we say that g is a homotopy equivalence if there is a continuous map h z y such that gh y y and hg z z are homotopic to the identities of 10 y and z respectively if there is a homotopy equivalence between y and z then we say that y and z are homotopy equivalent and simply write y z assume that y and z are pointed topological spaces with the base points y 0 and z 0 respectively and that the map g y z sends y 0 to z 0 the homotopy fibre f g of g is defined to be the following pointed topological space f g y 0 1 z y y 0 z 0 1 y g with the base point cz 0 y 0 where cz 0 is the constant path t 7 z 0 for t 0 1 note that homotopy fibres are well defined up to homotopy equivalences the homotopy fibre of the map z 0 z is called the loop space of z z 0 and denoted by z z 0 note that we can identify z z 0 with the set 0 1 z 0 z 0 1 and that there is a canonical map z z 0 f g 7 y 0 for z z 0 let n z z 0 denote the n th homotopy group of z z 0 for each n n then n z z 0 n 1 z z 0 further we define h f g y by y 7 y for any y f g then the sequence z z 0 f g h y y 0 g z z 0 gives rise to a long exact sequence of homotopy groups n 1 z z 0 n n f g cz 0 y 0 n h n y y 0 n g n z z 0 n 1 f g cz 0 y 0 0 f g cz 0 y 0 0 y y 0 0 z z 0 for a proof we refer the reader to 40 corollary iv 8 9 a sequence x x 0 f y y 0 g z z 0 of pointed topological spaces is called a homotopy fibration if the composite of f and g is equal to the constant map which sends every x in x to the base point of z and if the natural map x f g x 7 cz 0 x f for x x is a homotopy equivalence in this case the loop space z z 0 is homotopy equivalent to the homotopy fibre of f the sequence x x 0 f y y 0 g z z 0 of pointed topological spaces is called a weak homotopy fibration if there is a pointed topological space z z 0 and two pointed maps g 1 y z and g 2 z z with g g 1 g 2 such that 1 the sequence x x 0 f y y 0 g 1 z z 0 is a homotopy fibration and that 2 g 2 induces an injection 0 z z 0 0 z z 0 and a bijection n z z 0 n z z 0 for n 0 assume that x x 0 f y y 0 g z z 0 is a weak homotopy fibration then there is a long exact sequence of homotopy groups n 1 z z 0 n x x 0 n f n y y 0 n g n z z 0 n 1 x x 0 0 x x 0 0 y y 0 0 z z 0 for all n n and g 2 induces a homotopy equivalence g 2 z z 0 z z 0 thus z z 0 is homotopy equivalent to the homotopy fibre of f 11 3 2 frobenius pairs and their k theory spaces we recall some definitions given in 32 by a frobenius category we mean an exact category see 26 17 with enough projective and injective objects such that projectives and injectives coincide a map between two frobenius categories is an exact functor which preserves projective objects let c be a frobenius category we denote by c proj the full subcategory of c consisting of all projective objects it is well known that the factor category c of c modulo c proj called the stable category of c is a triangulated category moreover two objects x and y of c are isomorphic in c if and only if x p y q in c for some p q c proj in particular x 0 in c if and only if x c proj a subcategory x of c is called a frobenius subcategory of c if x is a frobenius category and the inclusion x c is a fully faithful map of frobenius categories in this case x proj c proj and a morphism in x factorizes through x proj if and only if it factorizes through c proj this implies that the inclusion x c induces a fully faithful inclusion x c of triangulated categories in general x does not have to be a triangulated subcategory of c since x is not necessarily closed under isomorphisms in c however by our convention the image of the inclusion x c is indeed a triangulated subcategory of c a pair c c c 0 of frobenius categories is called a frobenius pair if c is a small category and c 0 is a frobenius subcategory of c a map from a frobenius pair c c 0 to another frobenius pair c c 0 is a map of frobenius categories c c such that it restricts to a map from c 0 to c 0 see 32 section 4 3 let c c c 0 be a frobenius pair then the image of the inclusion c 0 c is a triangulated subcategory of c so we can form the verdier quotient of c by this image denoted by df c c c 0 which is called the derived category of the frobenius pair c here we use the same notation c c 0 as in 32 to denote the derived category of c but the meaning of c c 0 in our paper is slightly different from the one in 32 because we require that the image of an inclusion functor is closed under isomorphisms nevertheless all results in 32 work with this modified definition of derived categories clearly if c 0 c proj then df c c in this case we shall often write c for the frobenius pair c c proj the category c of a frobenius pair c c c 0 can be regarded as a small waldhausen category for definition see 37 or 8 the inflations in c form the cofibrations of c and the morphisms in c which are isomorphisms in df c form the weak equivalences of c in this note we shall write c for the waldhausen category c to emphasize the role of c 0 according to our foregoing notation we denote by c the waldhausen category defined by the frobenius pair c c proj for the waldhausen category c we denote the k theory space of c in the sense of waldhausen by k c which is a pointed topological space and the n th k group of k c by kn c for each n n it is known that k 0 c is naturally isomorphic to the grothendieck group k 0 df c of the small tri angulated category df c see 36 section 1 5 6 39 chapter iv proposition 8 4 and 33 proposition 3 2 22 let g c c be a map of frobenius pairs on the one hand g automatically induces a triangle functor df g df c df c which sends x c to g x c on the other hand g c c is an exact functor of associated waldhausen categories which induces a continuous map k g k c k c in this paper we assume that all waldhausen categories considered arise from frobenious pairs two typical examples of frobenius pairs are of our particular interest a the first typical example of frobenius pairs is provided by the categories of bounded complexes over exact categories let e be a small exact category for definition see 26 and 17 we denote by c b e the category of bounded chain complexes over e then c b e is a small exact category with degreewise split conflations 12 that is a sequence x y z is a conflation in c b e if x i y i zi is isomorphic to the split conflation x i x i zi zi for each i z actually c b e is even a frobenius category in which projective objects are exactly bounded contractible chain complexes over e recall that a chain complex x is called contractible when the identity on x is null homotopic moreover the stable category of c b e is the usual bounded homotopy category k b e that is df c b e k b e recall that a complex x x i di i z over e is called acyclic if d i is a composite of a deflation i with an inflation i such that i i 1 is a conflation for all i let c bac e c b e be the full subcategory of objects which are homotopy equivalent to acyclic chain complexes over e then c bac e contains all projective objects of the frobenius category c b e and is closed under extensions kernels of deflations as well as cokernels of inflations in c b e thus c bac e inherits a frobenius structure from c b e and c c b e c bac e is a frobenius pair in particular the pair c or the associated category c b e can be regarded as a wald hausen category a chain map f x y in c b e is called a cofibration if f i x i y i is a split inflation in e for each i z a weak equivalence if the mapping cone of f belongs to c bac e moreover df c coincides with the bounded derived category db e of c b e which is defined as follows let e be an arbitrary exact category the objects of db e are the objects of c b e the morphisms of db e are obtained from the chain maps by formally inverting the maps whose mapping cones are acyclic as complexes of objects in e for example if e is the usual exact category r mod with r a ring then d b e is the usual derived category db r for more details see 17 assume that the exact structure of e is induced from an abelian category a that is e a is a full subcategory such that it is closed under extensions and that a sequence x f y g z with all terms in e is a conflation in e if and only if 0 x f y g z 0 is an exact sequence in a furthermore assume that e is closed under kernels of epimorphisms in the abelian category in this case the chain map f x y is a weak equivalence in c if and only if f is a quasi isomorphism in c a that is h i f h i x h i y is an isomorphism in a for each i z note that an exact category e itself can also be understood as a waldhausen category with cofibrations being inflations and weak equivalences being isomorphisms up to now there are at least three algebraic k theory spaces associated with a small exact category e the quillen k theory space of the exact category e the waldhausen k theory space with respect to the waldhausen category e and the waldhausen k theory space of the waldhausen category defined by the frobenius pair c b e c bac e however these spaces are the same up to homotopy equivalence see 37 section 1 9 and 36 theorem 1 11 7 so in this paper we always identify these spaces b the next example of frobenius pairs is constructed from categories of finitely generated projective modules let r be a ring then the category r proj of finitely generated projective r modules is a small exact category with split short exact sequences as its conflations clearly this exact structure on r proj is induced from the usual exact structure of the abelian category r mod following quillen 26 the algebraic k theory space k r of r is defined to be the space k r proj of r proj and the n th algebraic k group kn r of r to be the n th homotopy group of k r we know from a that the pair c b r proj c bac r proj is a frobenius pair in this way c b r proj can be regarded as a small waldhausen category moreover c bac r proj consists of all bounded contractible chain complexes over r proj which are exactly projective objects in the frobenius category c b r proj in other words we have c b r proj proj c bac r proj thus df c b r proj is the bounded homotopy category k b r proj since each compact object of d r is quasi isomorphic to an object of c b r proj the verdier localization functor k r d r restricts to a triangle equivalence k b r proj dc r hence we see that k r k c b r proj and k c with c c b r proj c bac r proj are homotopy equivalent and therefore their algebraic kn groups are all isomorphic 13 let s be another ring and n a bounded complex of s r bimodules if sn c b s proj then the tensor functor n r c b r proj c b s proj is a map of frobenious pairs so we obtain a map k n r k r k s of k theory spaces in case r s is a ring homomorphism we choose n s and denote simply by k the map k s r k r k s since the homomorphism kn s 1 r kn r kn s induced from the map k s 1 r k r k s is equal to the minus of kn we shall denote the map k s 1 r by k note that the shift functor 1 c b r proj c b r proj is also a map of frobenius pairs now let be the diagonal map x 7 x x for x k r and let r proj r proj r proj be the coproduct functor then the induced map k 1 k r k r is a homotopy equivalence and a homotopy inverse of k r in the sense that the composite of the following maps k r k r k r k 1 id k r k r k k r is homotopic to the constant map which sends x to the base point of k r 3 3 fundamental theorems in algebraic k theory of frobenius pairs now we recall some basic results on algebraic k theory of frobenious pairs in terms of derived categories our main reference in this section is the paper 32 by schlichting the following localization theorem may trace back to the localization theorem in 26 section 5 theorem 5 for exact categories the fibration theorem in 37 theorem 1 6 4 for waldhausen categories and the localization theorem in 36 theorem 1 8 2 for complicial biwaldhausen categories for a proof of the present form we refer the reader to 32 propositions 3 and 5 p 126 and p 128 also the approximation and cofinality theorems are taken from 32 propositions 3 and 4 lemma 3 1 1 localization theorem let a f b g c be a sequence of frobenius pairs if the sequence df a df f df b df g df c of derived categories is exact then the induced sequence k a k f k b k g k c of k theory spaces is a homotopy fibration and therefore there is a long exact sequence of k groups kn 1 c kn a kn f kn b kn g kn c kn 1 a k 0 a k 0 b k 0 c 0 for all n n 2 approximation theorem let g b c be a map of frobenius pairs if the associated functor df g df b df c of derived categories is an equivalence then the induced map k g k b k c of k theory spaces is a homotopy equivalence in particular kn g kn b kn c for all n n 3 cofinality theorem let g b c be a map of frobenius pairs if the associated functor df g df b df c of derived categories is an equivalence up to factors then the induced map k g k b k c of k theory spaces gives rise to an injection k 0 g k 0 b k 0 c and an isomorphism kn g kn b kn c for all n 0 note that the surjectivity of the last map in the long exact sequence in lemma 3 1 1 follows from the fact that k 0 c is isomorphic to the grothendieck group k 0 df c of df c the localization theorem is useful but when we deal with k theory of recollements the obstacle for us to use it is that in a given recollement of derived module categories we do not know whether the given functors between derived categories are induced from exact functors between frobenius pairs 14 for our purpose of later proofs we mention the following result which is a slight variation of 32 section 6 1 and has been mentioned there without proof for the convenience of the reader we include here a proof see also 24 lemma 2 5 for a special case lemma 3 2 thickness theorem let c c c 0 be a frobenius pair suppose that there is a triangulated category c together with a triangle equivalence g df c c let x be a full triangulated subcategory of c define x to be the full subcategory of c consisting of objects x such that g x x then the following statements are true 1 the category x contains c 0 and is closed under extensions in c moreover x naturally inherits a frobenius structure from c and becomes a frobenius subcategory of c such that x proj c proj 2 both x x c 0 and cx c x are frobenius pairs and the inclusion functor x c and the identity functor c c induce the following commutative diagram of triangulated categories df x df c g df cx x c c x 3 if x is closed under direct summands in c then both rows in the diagram of 2 are exact sequences of triangulated categories proof 1 by definition of df c c c 0 the objects of df c are the same as the objects of c thus if m c 0 or m c proj then m 0 in df c this implies that x contains both c 0 and c proj since g is a triangle functor and x is a full triangulated subcategory of c it is easy to see that x is closed under extensions in c since x is closed under extensions in c we can endow x with an exact structure induced from the one of c namely a sequence x y z with all terms in x is called a conflation in x if it is a conflation in c then one can check that with this exact structure x becomes an exact category now we claim that x is even a frobenius category such that x proj c proj indeed it suffices to show that if l p n is a conflation in c with p c proj then l x if and only if n x actually such a conflation can be extended to a distinguished triangle l p n l 1 in c and further to a distinguished triangle in df c since p 0 in df c we have n l 1 in df c as x is closed under shifts in c and g is a triangle functor we know that g l x if and only if g n x in other words l x if and only if n x this verifies the claim 2 note that c 0 x c and c 0 proj x proj c proj thus x x c 0 and cx c x are frobenius pairs recall that df x x c 0 and df cx c x clearly the inclusion functor x c and the identity functor idc c c are maps from the frobenius pair x to the frobenius pairs c and from c to cx respectively so we have two triangle functors df x c 0 c c 0 and df idc c c 0 c x which are induced from the inclusion x c and the identity functor of c respectively clearly x contains c 0 that is the objects of c 0 is a subclass of the objects of x with the morphism set homc 0 x y homx x y for all objects x y in c 0 since the inclusion x c is fully faithful the functor df is also a fully faithful inclusion which gives rise to the following commutative diagram x c 0 df c c 0 g x c consequently g induces a triangle equivalence g 1 c c 0 x c 0 c x 15 by the universal property of the verdier localization functor q 1 c c x respectively q 2 c c 0 c c 0 x c 0 there is a triangle functor c x c c 0 x c 0 respectively c c 0 x c 0 c x such that q 2 q 0 q 1 respectively df idc q 2 where q 0 c c c 0 is the verdier localization functor since q 1 df idc q 0 we have q 1 q 2 q 0 df idc q 0 q 1 and df idc q 0 q 1 q 2 q 0 it follows that id and df idc q 2 as q 2 df idc df idc q 2 we obtain id thus is a triangle isomorphism now we define g g 1 c x c x then the following diagram of triangulated categories c c 0 df idc g c x g c q c x is commutative where q is the verdier localization functor now 2 follows from and 3 in this case x is the kernel of the localization functor q c c x thus 3 follows 4 algebraic k theory of differential graded algebras 4 1 definitions of k theory spaces of dg algebras in this subsection we shall give a definition of k theory spaces of differential graded algebras which gener alizes the one of k theory spaces of usual rings and modifies slightly the definition in 32 but at the level of homotopy groups the two definitions give the isomorphic algebraic kn groups for n n throughout this subsection k stands for an arbitrary but fixed commutative ring and all rings considered here are k algebras note that each ring with identity can be regarded as a z algebra let a be a differential graded dg associative and unitary k algebra that is a n za n is a z graded k algebra with a differential dn an an 1 such that an dn n z is a chain complex of k modules and xy dm n x ydn 1 n xdm y for m z x am and y an thus the map a k a a a k b 7 ba for a b a is a chain map a left dg a module m is a z graded left module m n zm n over the z graded k algebra a with a differential d such that mn d n z is a complex of k modules and for any a a m x mn the following holds ax dm n a xdn 1 n adm x in particular each dg a module is a z graded a module forgetting the differential for a dg a module m we denote by m 1 the shift of m by degree 1 we should observe that the dg algebra a d and left dg a module m defined in this paper are actually the dg algebra a op d and right dg a op module in the sense of 16 summary respectively in the following we give a typical way to obtain dg algebras by taking hom complexes of dg modules let x dx and y dy be two dg a modules the hom complex of x and y over a is defined to be the following complex hom a x y homn a x y d nx y n z over k as a k module the n th component homn a x y is formed by the morphisms h x y of graded a modules homogeneous of degree n in other words h is a homomorphism of a modules such that h hp p z with h p homk x p y p n further the differential d nx y hom n a x y homn 1 a x y of degree n is given by hp p z 7 hpd p n y 1 nd p x h p 1 p z 16 furthermore we take another dg a module z and define hom a x y hom a y z hom a x z f g 7 f pgp m p z for f f p p z hom m a x y and g gp p z hom n a y z with m n z thus the operation is associative and distributive in particular under this operation hom a x x is a z graded ring moreover the above defined operation satisfies the following identity f g d m nx z f g d n y z 1 n f d mx y g this implies that hom a x x together with the differential of itself as a complex over k is a dg algebra in this sense end a x will be called the dg endomorphism ring of x and denoted simply by end a x also due to the above identity the complex hom a x y is actually a left dg end a x and right dg end a y bimodule now we recall the definition of the category c a of left dg a modules actually this category has all dg a modules as objects and a homomorphism f x y between dg a modules x and y is a chain map of complexes over k which commutes with the a actions on x and y this means that homc a x y is exactly the 0 th cocycle of the complex hom a x y it is known that c a is a frobenius category see 16 section 2 by declaring a conflation to be a short sequence of dg a modules such that the underlying sequence of graded a modules forgetting differentials is split exact the stable category of c a is the dg homotopy category k a in which the objects are the dg a modules and the morphisms are the homo topy classes of homomorphisms of dg a modules in other words homk a x y is equal to the 0 th cohomology h 0 hom a x y of the complex hom a x y we say that f is a quasi isomorphism if it is a quasi isomorphism as a chain map of complexes over k that is h i f h i x h i y is an isomorphism for every i z by inverting all quasi isomorphisms of dg a modules we obtain the dg derived category d a of a this is a triangulated category and generated by the dg module a that is d a tria a observe that an ordinary k algebra a can be regarded as a dg algebra concentrated in degree 0 and that the above mentioned categories c a k a and d a coincide with the usual complex homotopy and derived categories of the category of left a modules respectively to give a description of d a by a triangulated subcategory of k a up to equivalence we shall recall some more definitions in 16 the dg a module x is said to be acyclic if it is acyclic as a complex of k modules that is h i x 0 for all i z is said to have the property p if homk a x y 0 for any acyclic dg a module y or equivalently hom a x y is acyclic as a complex over k note that the class of dg a modules with the property p is closed under extensions shifts direct summands and direct sums in c a we denote by k a p the full subcategory of k a consisting of all modules with the property p then k a p k a is a triangulated subcategory containing a and being closed under direct sums more important by 16 section 3 1 the verdier localization functor q k a d a restricts to a triangle equivalence q k a p d a this implies that any quasi isomorphism between two dg a modules with the property p is an isomorphism in k a and that for each dg a module m there is a functorial quasi isomorphism pm m of dg a modules such that pm has the property p with the help of the above triangle equivalence we can define the total left derived functors of tensor functors this procedure is similar to the one for usual complexes over ordinary rings let w be a right dg a module and x a left dg a module the tensor complex of w and x over a is defined to be the following complex w a x w n a x nw x n z over k as a k module the n th component w n a x is the quotient module of p zw p k x n p modulo the k submodule generated by all elements ua v u av for u w r a as and v x t with r s t z and 17 n r s t further the differential w x of degree n is given by w x 7 w d p w x 1 pw x d n p x for w w p and x xn p assume further that b is another dg algebra and that w is a b a bimodule then w a x is indeed a dg b module this gives rise to the following tensor functor bw a c a c b x 7 w a x now the total left derived functor w l a d a d b of this functor is defined by x 7 w a px particularly if x has the property p then w l a x w a x in d b a dg a module m is called relatively countable projective respectively countable projective if there is a dg a module n such that m n is isomorphic to i i a ni as dg a modules respectively as z graded a modules where i is a countable set and ni z clearly relatively countable projective modules are countable projective modules and have the property p since homk a a i m h i m for all i let x a be the full subcategory of c a consisting of countable projective a modules then x a is an essentially small category this is due to the following observation let g a be the category of z graded a modules for every x i z x i g a we have the following a the class u x consisting of isomorphism classes of direct summands of x in g a is a set in fact there is a surjection from the set of idempotent elements of endg a x to u x b the class v x consisting of all dg a modules with x as the underlying graded a module is also a set since v x is contained into the set x di i z d i homk x i x i 1 which is a countable union of sets furthermore x a is closed under extensions shifts direct summands and countable direct sums in c a let c a 0 be the smallest full subcategory of x a such that it 1 contains all relatively countable projective a modules 2 is closed under extensions and shifts 3 is closed under countable direct sums then c a 0 is essentially small inherits an exact structure from c a and becomes a fully exact subcategory of c a even more c a 0 is a frobenius subcategory of c a in which projective injective objects are the ones of c a belonging to c a 0 this can be concluded from the following fact for each m c a there is a canonical conflation m c m m 1 in c a such that c m is a projective injective object of c a see 16 section 2 2 hence c a 0 provides a natural frobenius pair c a 0 c a 0 proj and the inclusion c a 0 c a induces a fully faithful inclusion from the derived category df c a 0 of c a 0 to k a we denote by k a 0 the full subcategory of k a consisting of those complexes which are iso morphic in k a to objects of c a 0 then k a 0 is a triangulated subcategory of k a by the condition 2 and the inclusion df c a 0 k a 0 is a triangle equivalence since the full subcat egory of x a consisting of all dg a modules with the property p satisfies the above conditions 1 3 we deduce that each object of c a 0 has the property p this implies that k a 0 k a p fur thermore by definition c a 0 is closed under countable direct sums in c a and therefore k a 0 is closed under countable direct sums in k a p it follows from lemma 2 1 1 that k a 0 is closed under direct summands in k a p now let x a be the full subcategory of d a consisting of all those objects which are isomorphic in d a to the images of objects of k a 0 under the equivalence q k a p d a then x a is a triangulated subcategory of d a closed under direct summands and q induces a triangle equivalence from k a 0 to x a in all we have df c a 0 k a 0 k a p x a d a 18 and df c a 0 k a 0 x a as triangulated categories recall that a dg a module m is called a finite cell module if there is a finite filtration 0 m 0 m 1 m 2 mn m of dg a modules such that for each 0 i n 1 n the quotient module mi 1 mi is isomorphic to a ni for some ni z see 18 part iii clearly each finite cell a module belongs to c a 0 moreover the category of finite cell a modules is closed under extensions in c a 0 actually this category is a frobenius subcategory of c a 0 in which projective injective objects are the ones of c a 0 belonging to this subcategory an object m d a is said to be compact if homd a m commutes with direct sums in d a let d c a be the full subcategory of d a consisting of all compact objects then dc a is the smallest full triangulated subcategory of d a containing a and being closed under direct summands of its objects in fact each compact object of d a is a direct summand of a finite cell module in d a see 16 section 5 this implies the following chain of full subcategories dc a x a d a now we define wa to be the full subcategory of c a 0 consisting of all those objects in c a 0 such that they are isomorphic in d a to compact objects of d a clearly wa is essentially small more over by applying lemma 3 2 to the frobenius pair c a 0 and the equivalence df c a 0 x a with the triangulated subcategory dc a of x a we deduce that wa is a frobenius subcategory of c a 0 with the same projective objects and that the following diagram of triangulated categories com mutes df wa df c a 0 k a p q k a q zztt t t t t t t t d c a x a d a from now on we regard wa as a waldhausen category in the sense of subsection 3 2 namely it arises exactly from the frobenius pair wa wa proj definition 4 1 the algebraic k theory space of the dg k algebra a is defined to be the space k wa of the waldenhausen category wa denoted by k a for each n n the n th algebraic k group of a is defined to be the n th homotopy group of k a and denoted by kn a note that k 0 a is isomorphic to k 0 df wa the grothendieck group of the essentially small trian gulated category df wa of the frobenius pair wa wa proj see subsection 3 2 as a result we have the following fact lemma 4 2 the verdier localization functor k a d a induces a triangle equivalence df wa d c a in particular k 0 wa is isomorphic to the grothendieck group k 0 d c a of dc a our definition of k theory spaces of dg algebras has the following property lemma 4 3 let fa be the full subcategory of wa consisting of all finite cell a modules then the inclusion fa wa induces an injection k 0 fa k 0 wa and an isomorphism kn fa kn wa for each n 0 proof note that fa is a frobenius subcategory of wa and that the inclusions fa wa c a induce fully faithful inclusions df fa df wa k a p see subsection 3 2 to show that the inclusion df fa df wa is an equivalence up to factors we shall compare the images of these two categories under the equivalence q k a p d a in the above diagram in fact by lemma 4 2 the restriction of the functor q to df wa gives rise to a triangle equivalence df wa 19 d c a let y be the smallest full triangulated subcategory of dc a containing a since the objects of df fa are the same as the ones of fa the image of the restriction of the functor q to df fa is contained in y and therefore is equal to y thus q induces a triangle equivalence df fa y since d c a thick a and a y dc a we have thick y dc a so the inclusion y dc a is an equivalence up to factors consequently the inclusion df fa df wa induced from fa wa is also an equivalence up to factors now lemma 4 3 follows from lemma 3 1 3 remark 4 4 in 32 section 12 3 a k theory spectrum k fa is defined for the category fa moreover it is known in 32 theorem 8 that for each n n the n th homology group of k fa is given by n k fa kn fa if n 0 k 0 d c a if n 0 thus lemmas 4 3 and 4 2 show that n k fa kn a for all n n and therefore at the level of homotopy groups our definition of k theory for dg algebras is isomorphic to the one defined by schlichting in 32 the following result together with lemma 4 3 may explain the advantage of defining k theory of arbi trary dg algebras by using the category wa rather than fa lemma 4 5 let a be an algebra with identity and let a be the dg algebra a concentrated in degree 0 then k a and k a are homotopy equivalent as k theory spaces proof clearly c a c a k a k a and d a d a in particular dc a dc a by the construction of wa we see that c b a proj wa and c b a proj proj c bac a proj wa proj thus the inclusion j c b a proj wa is a fully faithful map of frobenius pairs in other words c b a proj is a frobenius subcategory of wa this implies that the triangle functor df j df c b a proj df wa is fully faithful see subsection 3 2 now we show that df j is an equivalence on the one hand the localization functor q k a d a induces an equivalence q 1 df wa d c a by lemma 4 2 on the other hand the composite of the following functors k b r proj df c b a proj df j df wa q 1 dc a is also an equivalence induced by q thus df j is a triangle equivalence by lemma 3 1 2 we know that k a k wa k a as k theory spaces 4 2 homotopy equivalences of k theory spaces from perfect dg modules in this subsection we introduce the definition of perfect dg modules over dg rings and discuss homotopy equivalences of k theory spaces of dg algebras linked by perfect dg modules let a be a dg algebra a dg a module is said to be perfect if it belongs to wa recall that each perfect dg a module has the property p and is compact in d a conversely each compact dg a module is isomorphic in d a to a perfect one but itself may not have the property p moreover if a is an ordinary ring concentrated in degree 0 then each bounded complex of finitely generated projective a modules is perfect first of all we point out the following result which may illustrate the importance of perfect dg modules for a proof we refer to 16 section 3 1 lemma 4 6 let m be a dg a module and let s end a m if am is perfect then the left derived functor m l s d s tria am is a triangle equivalence in the following lemma we can see that perfect dg modules always provide us with maps of frobenius pairs which define algebraic k theory spaces of dg algebras 20 lemma 4 7 let b be a dg algebra and let m be a dg a b bimodule if am is perfect then the tensor functor am b wb wa is a map of frobenius pairs proof for simplicity we denote by g the tensor functor m b c b c a in the following we show that g wb wa let x b and x a be the full subcategories of c b and c a consisting of all countable projective modules respectively recall that x a is closed under shifts direct summands and countable direct sums in c a then it follows from g b m b b m wa x a that the functor g x b x a is well defined since g always preserves conflations and commutes with both shifts and countable direct sums the following full subcategory g 1 c a 0 n x b g n c a 0 of x b contains all relatively countable projective b modules and is closed under extensions shifts and countable direct sums given that c b 0 is the smallest subcategory of x b admitting these properties we have c b 0 g 1 c a 0 thus g c b 0 c a 0 and g c b 0 c a 0 is a well defined functor furthermore since each object n c b 0 always has the property p we see that g n m lb n in d a so to show that g wb wa it suffices to prove that if n wb then m l b n dc a for checking this we take an object n wb then n d c b since each perfect dg a module is compact in d a we have m l b b m b b m d c a this implies that the functor m l b d b d a preserves compact objects thus m l b n dc a and g wb wa recall that for an arbitrary dg algebra s the category ws proj consists of all those objects which are homotopy equivalent to the zero object in c s as g always preserves conflations and homotopy equiva lences we see that g sends projective objects of wb to the ones of wa thus g wb wa is a map of frobenius pairs next we show that perfect dg modules can offer homotopy equivalences of algebraic k theory spaces lemma 4 8 let b be a dg algebra and let m be a dg a b bimodule such that am is perfect let p be the full subcategory of wa consisting of all those dg a modules which regarded as objects of d a belong to tria am then the followings hold true 1 the category p is a frobenius subcategory of wa and the map am b wb wa factorizes through the inclusion p wa 2 if the left derived functor am l b d b tria am is an equivalence then am b wb p induces a homotopy equivalence k b k p of k theory spaces if in addition d a tria am then k b k a as k theory spaces proof 1 let x tria am d c a then x is a full triangulated subcategory of dc a since the localization functor q k a d a induces a triangle equivalence df wa dc a by lemma 4 2 we see that p is exactly the full subcategory of wa consisting of all those dg a modules which are isomorphic in dc a to objects of x hence by lemma 3 2 p is a frobenius subcategory of wa and q induces a triangle equivalence q 1 df p x by lemma 4 7 the functor g wb wa is a map of frobenius pairs note that d b tria b and m l b commutes with arbitrary direct sums by lemma 2 1 2 we have m l b n tria am it follows that m l b n tria am d c a x and therefore g wb p this implies that m b wb wa factorizes through the inclusion p wa 2 since d a tria a and am d c a we know from 22 theorem 4 4 9 that x coincides with the full subcategory of tria am consisting of all compact objects in tria am now suppose that the functor m l b d b tria am is an equivalence then this functor restricts to a triangle equivalence 21 d c b x moreover by lemma 4 2 the localization functor k b d b induces an equivalence q df wb dc b from the following commutative diagram df wb q df m b df p q d c b m l b x we infer that df m b df wb df p is a triangle equivalence it follows from lemma 3 1 2 that k b k p as k theory spaces clearly if d a tria am then p wa thus 2 follows as a consequence of lemma 4 8 we re obtain the following result in 12 proposition 6 7 and corollary 3 10 where its proof uses knowledge on model categories corollary 4 9 let b a be a homomorphism of dg algebras which is a quasi isomorphism then the functor a b c b c a induces a homotopy equivalence k b k a of k theory spaces in particular if h i a 0 for all i 6 0 then k a k h 0 a proof in lemma 4 8 we take m a then m is a dg a b bimodule via b a such that it is perfect as a dg a module and that tria am d a since is a quasi isomorphism of dg algebras it follows from 18 proposition 4 2 that the functor a b induces a triangle equivalence d b d a see also 16 section 3 1 now the first part of corollary 4 9 follows from lemma 4 8 2 suppose that a ai di i z with h i a 0 for all i 6 0 we define 0 a to be the following dg algebra a 3 d 3 a 2 d 2 a 1 d 1 ker d 0 0 then there exist two canonical quasi isomorphisms 0 a a and 0 a h 0 a of dg algebras it follows from the first part of corollary 4 9 that k 0 a k a and k 0 a k h 0 a combining these homotopy equivalences with lemma 4 5 we see that k a k h 0 a as k theory spaces combining lemma 4 8 with lemma 4 6 we have the following applicable result corollary 4 10 let m be a perfect dg a module and let s end a m define p to be the full subcategory of wa consisting of all those dg a modules which regarded as objects in d a belong to tria am then k s k p as k theory spaces moreover if d a tria am then k s k a as k theory spaces as a consequence of corollary 4 10 we obtain the following fact corollary 4 11 let m and n be two perfect dg a modules if tria m tria n d a then k end a m k end a n the following result conveys that for ordinary rings we can choose smaller subcategories of perfect complexes to realize the homtopy equivalence in corollary 4 10 corollary 4 12 let a be an algebra and p c b a proj define s end a p and p to be the full subcategory of c b a proj consisting of all those complexes which regarded as objects in d a belong to tria p then k s k p as k theory spaces 22 proof we remark that p is a frobenius subcategory of c b a proj such that its derived category df p is equivalent to x tria p dc a via the localization functor q k a d a actually since x is a full triangulated subcategory of dc a and df c b a proj k b a proj d c a we see that p is exactly the full subcategory of c b a proj in which the objects are complexes in c b a proj such that they are isomorphic in dc a to objects of x hence by lemma 3 2 p is a frobenius subcategory of c b a proj and the functor q induces an equivalence q 1 df p x now we view a as a dg algebra concentrated in degree 0 and let x be the full subcategory of wa consisting of those objects that are isomorphic in d a to objects of tria ap since each object of wa is compact in d a we clearly have x x wa x x note that p is a dg a s bimodule such that it is perfect as a dg a module so from the proof of lemma 4 8 1 we know that x is a frobenius subcategory of wa the functor p s ws x is a map of frobenius pairs and q induces a triangle equivalence q 2 df x x in the following we first show that k p k x and then that k s k x as k theory spaces with these two homotopy equivalences in mind we will obviously have k s k p as desired let us check that k p k x actually it follows from c b a proj wa that p x since p proj c bac a proj wa proj x proj the inclusion p x of frobenius categories induces a fully faithful functor df df p df x since q 1 q 2 df we see that df is an equivalence thus the map k k p k x is a homotopy equivalence by lemma 3 1 2 it remains to show that the map p s ws x induces a homotopy equivalence k s k x in fact since each object of c b a proj is perfect it follows from lemma 4 6 that the functor p l s d s tria ap is a triangle equivalence thus k s k x by lemma 4 8 2 4 3 decomposition of higher algebraic k groups in this subsection we shall establish reduction formulas for calculation of algebraic k groups of dg algebras the main result of this subsection is proposition 4 14 which will be applied in the next subsection to show theorem 1 1 first we extend a result of berrick and keating see 2 on algebraic k groups of triangular matrix rings to the ones of dg triangular matrix rings lemma 4 13 let r s m 0 t be the dg triangular matrix algebra defined by dg algebras s t and a dg s t bimodule m then kn r kn s kn t for all n n proof let e 0 0 0 1 r f 1 0 0 0 r and j rer then e 2 e f 2 f ere t and r j s on the one hand for each n z we have homd r re r f n homk r re r f n h n hom r re r f hn ehom r r r f hn er f 0 on the other hand both re and r f are compact in d r and tria re r f tria r d r then by 15 theorem 3 3 there exists a recollement of derived categories of dg algebras d s d d r er r rhomr s dd s l r d t re l t rhomt er dd where d is the restriction functor induced from the canonical surjection r s note that the functors s l r and re l t preserve compact objects and that rs r f d c r and er t dc t thus 23 from the above recollement we can get the following half recollement for the subcategories of compacts objects dc s d dc r er r s l r d c t re l t this implies that the following sequence of triangulated categories d c s dc r s l r oo dc t re l t oo is exact since rre wr and ss ws we see from lemma 4 7 that the following functors re t wt wr and s r wr ws are well defined maps of frobenius pairs moreover by lemma 4 2 we can construct the following commu tative diagram d c s dc r s l r oo dc t re l t oo df ws oo df wr df s r oo oo df wt df re t oo oo this implies that the second row is an exact sequence of triangulated categories df ws df wr df s r oo df wt df re t oo by lemma 3 1 1 the following sequence of maps among k theory spaces k s k r k s r oo k t k re t oo is a homotopy fibration and therefore there is a long exact sequence of k groups kn 1 s kn t kn re t kn r kn s r kn s kn 1 t k 0 t k 0 r k 0 s 0 for all n n it remains to show that this sequence breaks up into a series of split short exact sequences actually since er t wt the functor er r wr wt is a map of frobenius pairs due to lemma 4 7 note that er r re t ere t idwt wt wt thus the composite of the map k re t k t k r with the map k er r k r k t is homotopic to the identity map on k t in view of kn groups we have kn re t kn er r idkn t kn t kn t for each n n this implies that kn re t kn t kn r is a split injection combining this with the above long exact sequence we see that kn r kn s kn t for each n n now we give the main result of this subsection 24 proposition 4 14 let a be a dg algebra and let m and n be two perfect dg a modules suppose that homd a m n i 0 for all i z then kn end a m n kn end a m kn end a n for all n n if in addition d a tria m n then kn a kn end a m kn end a n for all n n proof we define b end a m n then b end a m hom a m n hom a n m end a n since m is perfect it always has the property p this implies that homk a m n i homd a m n i for each i z consequently we have h i hom a m n homk a m n i homd a m n i 0 and therefore the following canonical inclusion c end a m 0 hom a n m end a n end a m hom a m n hom a n m end a n b is a quasi isomorphism of dg algebras it follows from lemma 4 9 that k b k c as k theory spaces and therefore kn b kn c for each n n further due to lemma 4 13 we have kn c kn end a m kn end a n thus the first part of proposition 4 14 follows to show the second part of proposition 4 14 we note that kn a kn b by corollary 4 10 because the dg a module m n is perfect and d a tria m n following 25 section 4 we say that a homomorphism r s of dg algebras is a homological epimorphism if the restriction functor d d s d r is fully faithful this is also equivalent to that the canonical homomorphism s l r s s is an isomorphism in d s clearly each homological ring epimorphism is a homological epimorphism of dg algebras concentrated in degree 0 corollary 4 15 let r s be a homological epimorphism of dg algebras if the dg r module s is compact in d r then there exists a dg algebra t determined by such that kn r kn s kn t for all n n proof since is a homological epimorphism of dg algebras it follows from 25 section 4 that there is a recollement of triangulated categories d s i d r j ff i xx tria rq gg j ww where q is a dg r r bimodule such that r s q r 1 is a distinguished triangle in k r k r op and where j is the canonical embedding and j q l r i s l r i d this implies that homd r q s m 0 for any m z and that d r tria q s 25 assume that rs d c r then q dc r as each compact object of d r is isomorphic in d r to a perfect dg r module there are two perfect dg r modules n and m such that n s and m q in d r it follows that homd r m n m 0 for any m z and that d r tria m n by proposition 4 14 kn r kn end r m kn end r n for all n n now we define t end r m and b end r n to finish the proof of corollary 4 15 it suffices to show that kn b kn s as k groups for each n n on the one hand since rn is perfect the left derived functor n l b d b tria rn is a triangle equivalence by lemma 4 6 on the other hand since the functor i is fully faithful the adjoint pair i i implies that i restricts to a triangle equivalence tria rs d s moreover due to n s in d r we have tria rn tria rs thus the composite s l r n l b d b d s of the functors n l b and i is a triangle equivalence since rn is perfect we see that rn has the property p and that s b n is a perfect dg s module by lemma 4 7 as the functor n b k b k r preserves dg modules with the property p we clearly have s lr n l b s r n l b d b d s it follows from lemma 4 8 2 that k b k s as k theory spaces this gives rise to kn b kn s applying corollary 4 15 to homological epimorphisms of ordinary rings we obtain the following result corollary 4 16 let r s be a homological ring epimorphism such that rs has a finite type resolution denote by q the two term complex 0 r s 0 with r and s in degrees 0 and 1 respectively let p c b r proj such that tria p tria rq d r then kn r kn s kn end r p for all n n proof since rs has a finite type resolution we can choose a complex n in c b r proj such that rs is isomorphic to n in d r so we get a chain map from rr to n such that its mapping cone m is isomorphic in d r to q it follows that m c b r proj and tria m tria rq d r next we regard r and s as dg z algebras concentrated in degree 0 then r s is a homological epimorphism of dg algebras moreover both n and m are perfect dg r modules by lemma 4 5 and the proof of corollary 4 15 we see that kn r kn s kn end r m for all n n note that both m and p are perfect and that tria p tria rq tria m by corollary 4 11 we have kn end r m kn end r p thus kn r kn s kn end r p remark 4 17 let us give a comment on the relationship between corollary 4 16 and 8 theorem 1 1 recall that in 8 theorem 1 1 we describe the difference between kn r and kn s by the n th algebraic k group of a complicial biwaldhausen category w r defined in 19 theorem 14 9 concretely w r is the full subcategory of c b r proj consisting of all those complexes x such that s r x is acyclic as a waldhausen category it has injective chain maps which are degreewise split as cofibrations and has homotopy equivalences as weak equivalences in this sense the cofibrations and weak equivalences of w r are induced from the frobenius pair w r c bac r proj in 8 theorem 1 1 it was shown that kn r kn s kn r for all n n where kn r kn w r now we point out kn end r p kn r for the complex p in corollary 4 16 in fact since r s is homological we see that ker s lr tria rq d r by lemma 2 3 note that w r consists of all those complexes x c b r proj such that s lr x 0 in d s thus w r is the same as the full subcategory of c b r proj consisting of all those complexes which regarded as objects in d r belong to tria rq since p c b r proj and tria rq tria rp we know from corollary 4 12 that kn end r p kn w r kn r 26 finally we give an example to illustrate that the dg algebra in corollary 4 16 cannot be substituted by its underlying ring just forgetting the differential note that in this example the ring homomorphism r s has already been considered in 8 to illustrate 8 theorem 1 1 let r be the following quiver algebra over a field k with relations 1 2 ff 0 further let ei be the idempotent element of r corresponding to the vertex i for i 1 2 and let r s be the noncommutative localization of r at the homomorphism re 2 re 1 induced by then s is equal to the following quiver algebra over k with relations 1 2 1 ff 1 e 1 and 1 e 2 and r s is given explicitly by e 1 7 e 1 e 2 7 e 2 7 7 0 for an explanation we refer the reader to 8 thus s is isomorphic to the usual 2 2 matrix ring m 2 k over k note that se 2 se 1 re 1 and that s se 1 se 2 re 1 re 1 as r modules hence is a homological ring epimorphism such that rs is finitely generated and projective in 8 we show that kn r kn s kn r for all n n where w r coincides with the full subcategory of c b r proj consisting of those complexes x such that h i x add s 1 for all i z here s 1 denotes the simple r module corresponding to the vertex 1 now we follow corollary 4 16 and remark 4 17 to describe kn r as the kn group of a dg algebra let q 0 re 2 re 1 0 and p 0 r s 0 where re 2 and r are of degree 0 clearly q c b r proj and p 1 is the mapping cone of since se 2 se 1 re 1 as r modules we infer that q p in c r and tria q tria rp d r thus all the assumptions of corollary 4 16 are satisfied it follows from corollary 4 16 that kn r kn s kn t for all n n where t end r q is the dg endomorphism algebra of the complex q see subsection 2 1 for definition by remark 4 17 we also have kn r kn t for all n n it is easy to check that the dg algebra t t i i z is given by the following data t 1 k t 0 k k t 1 k t i 0 for i 6 1 0 1 with the differential 0 t 1 0 t 0 1 1 t 1 0 and the multiplication t t t see subsection 2 1 t 1 t 1 t 1 t 1 0 t 1 t 1 t 1 t 1 a b c d ac bd f a b f a a b f b f g a b gb a b g ag where a b c d t 0 f t 1 and g t 1 27 since h 1 t 0 the dg algebra t is quasi isomorphic to the following dg algebra 0 t over k 0 t 1 0 ker d 0 0 where d 0 1 1 t 0 t 1 clearly the latter algebra is isomorphic to the dg algebra a 0 k 0 k 0 where the first k is of degree 1 and has a k k bimodule structure via multiplication thus the algebra structure of a by forgetting its differential is precisely the trivial extension k k of k by the bimodule k now by lemma 4 9 we know that k t k 0 t k a as k theory spaces this implies that kn t kn a and therefore kn r kn a thus kn r kn s kn t kn s kn a for all n n it is worth noting that we cannot replace the dg algebra a in the above isomorphism by the trivial extension k k since the algebraic k theory of dg algebras is different from that of usual rings in fact in this example k 1 r k 1 k k 1 k k k k 1 s k and k 1 a k but k 1 k k k k so k 1 r 6 k 1 s k 1 k k 4 4 proofs of theorem 1 1 and corollary 1 2 with previous preparations now we prove the first two results in the introduction proof of theorem 1 1 we regard the ordinary ring r as a dg algebra r concentrated in degree 0 then c r is exactly the category of dg r modules and d r coincides with d r moreover by lemma 4 5 k r is homotopy equivalent to k r as k theory spaces and therefore kn r kn r for all n n note that a complex x d r is compact if and only if x is quasi isomorphic to a complex y c b r proj now we assume that there exists a recollement d s i d r ff i xx d t ff j xx such that i s is compact in d r on the one hand the dg module j t is always compact in d r by lemma 2 2 3 on the other hand we see that d r tria j t i s and that homd r j t i s m homd r i j t s m 0 for each m z because i i is an adjoint pair and i j 0 recall that each compact object of d r is isomorphic in d r to a perfect dg r module so there exist two perfect dg r modules m and n such that m j t and n i s in d r consequently we have tria m n d r and homd r m n m 0 for all m z it follows from proposition 4 14 that kn r kn end r m kn end r n for all n n next we claim that 1 hm end r m 0 if m 6 0 t if m 0 and that 2 hm end r n 0 if m 6 0 s if m 0 28 in fact since rm is perfect it has the property p this implies that hm end r m homk r m m m homd r m m m as j d t d r is fully faithful we have homd r m m m homd r j t j t m homd t t t m 0 if m 6 0 t if m 0 thus 1 holds similarly we can show that 2 also holds since rn is perfect and i d s d r is fully faithful now by corollary 4 9 it follows from 1 and 2 that kn end r m kn t and kn end r n kn s respectively thus kn r kn r kn s kn t for each n n we remark that the proof of theorem 1 1 shows a little bit more if d r in theorem 1 1 is replaced by d r with r a dg algebra then kn r kn s kn t proof of corollary 1 2 note that i s s and that rs is quasi isomorphic to a bounded complex of finitely generated projective r modules if and only if rs admits a finite type resolution so for the recollement in corollary 1 2 if rs has a finite type resolution then it follows from theorem 1 1 that kn r kn s kn t for each n n similarly we can prove corollary 1 2 for the case that sr has a finite type resolution in fact this can be understood from lemma 2 4 and the following fact for any ring a there is a homotopy equivalence k a k aop see 26 sections 1 3 and 2 5 thus corollary 1 2 follows 5 applications to algebraic k theory of homological exact contexts in this section we apply our results to algebraic k theory of exact contexts see 6 we mainly concentrate on two classes of exact contexts one is induced from noncommutative localizations and the other is from the free products of groups 5 1 k theory of noncommutative localizations first we recall some results about noncommutative localizations in algebraic k theory see 24 23 let a set of homomorphisms between finitely generated projective r modules by abuse of notation we always identify each map p 1 f p 0 in with the two term complex 0 p 1 f p 0 0 in c b r proj where pi is in the degree i for i 0 1 moreover let r r be the noncommutative localization of r at note that the terminology noncommutative localization was originally called universal localization in the literature for example see 28 part i 4 moreover is a ring epimorphism with torr 1 r r 0 now we recall from 24 definition 0 4 the definition of a small waldhausen category r precisely the category r is the smallest full subcategory of c b r proj which i contains all the complexes in ii contains all acyclic complexes iii is closed under the formation of mapping cones and shifts iv contains any direct summands of any of its objects we remark that in r the cofibrations are injective chain maps which are degreewise split and the weak equivalences are homotopy equivalences so the cofibrations and weak equivalences of r are exactly induced from the frobenius pair r c bac r proj following remark 4 17 let w r be the full subcategory of c b r proj consisting of all those complexes x such that r r x is acyclic then r w r as waldhausen categories by the proof of 8 corollary 1 2 the following result follows from 24 theorem 0 5 29 lemma 5 1 if r r is homological then there is a weak homotopy fibration of k theory spaces k r k f k r k k r where f r c b r proj is the inclusion in this case we have a long exact sequence of k groups kn 1 r kn r kn f kn r kn kn r kn 1 r k 0 r k 0 r k 0 r for all n n one of the significant methods for calculating k groups is to have a kind of long mayer vietoris se quences which link k groups of rings together in the following we shall establish some long exact sequences of this type which are induced from homological exact contexts introduced in 6 we follow all the notations introduced in section 1 let m m be an arbitrary but fixed exact context where r s and r t are ring homo morphisms and where m is an s t bimodule with an element m then there is map s r t m defined by s t 7 smt for s s and t t also by the definition of exact context there is a map m t r s which makes the following diagram commutative r s t m m m r s t t r s where s s t r s s 7 1 s and t t t r s t 7 t 1 in 9 we use as a twisting to define a ring structure on t r s called the noncommutative tensor product of m m and denoted t r s see 9 section 4 1 for details define b s m 0 t e 1 1 0 0 0 and e 2 0 0 0 1 b then by 6 lemma 5 1 the noncommutative localization of b at the map be 1 be 2 s 0 7 sm 0 for s s is given by the following ring homomorphism b s m 0 t 0 t r s t r s t r s t r s c furthermore let p be the complex 0 be 1 be 2 0 over b with be 1 and be 2 in degrees 1 and 0 respectively note that be 1 and be 2 are also right r modules via and respectively and that the map m s m is a homomorphism of s r bimodules thus is actually a homomorphism of b r bimodules and therefore p is a bounded complex over b z r op since bp c b b proj it makes sense to discuss the tensor functor p r c b r proj c b b proj let w b be the full subcategory of c b b proj consisting of those complexes x such that c b x is acyclic as a waldhausen category w b is exactly induced from the frobenius pair w b c bac b proj now we regard w b as a frobenius subcategory of c b b proj and define kn b kn w b 30 lemma 5 2 the functor p r c b r proj c b b proj induces a homotopy equivalence from k r to k w b proof we first claim that the functor p r c r proj c b proj factorizes through the inclusion w b c b b proj in fact since is the noncommutative localization of b at the map c b c b be 1 c b be 2 is an isomorphism of c modules this implies that the complex c p is acyclic thus p w b and p r c b r proj c b b proj admits a factorisation as follows c b r proj g w b c b b proj note that w b is a frobenius subcategory of c b r proj such that its derived category df w b is equal to the full subcategory of k b b proj consisting of all objects of w b in this sense g is a map of frobenius pairs next we show that the map k g k r k w b induced from g is a homotopy equivalence actually by 6 lemma 5 4 the left derived functor p lr d r d b is fully faithful this induces a triangle equivalence d r tria p which restricts to an equivalence between full subcategories of compact objects d c r tria p c since d b tria b and p dc b we see from 22 theorem 4 4 9 that tria p c tria p dc b further by 23 theorem 0 11 the category tria p c coincides with the full subcategory of dc b consist ing of all those complexes x such that c lb x 0 in d c now we identify k b r proj and k b b proj with dc r and dc b up to triangle equivalences respectively then p r k b r proj k b b proj induces a triangle equivalence df g df c b r proj k b r proj df w b by lemma 3 1 2 the map k g k r k w b is a homotopy equivalence as a preparation for the proof of theorem 1 3 we need the following result see 6 theorem 1 1 lemma 5 3 let m m be a homological exact context then the ring homomorphism b c is a homological noncommutative localization and there is a recollement of derived module categories d c d d b j ff c lb xx d r ff j xx where d is the restriction functor induced by and where j bp lr and j hom b p for homological exact contexts we can establish the following result which links k theory spaces of rings involved in exact contexts together lemma 5 4 let m m be a homological exact context then the sequence of k theory spaces k r k k k s k t k k k t r s is a weak homotopy fibration where k denotes the map k s 1 r k r k s induced from the functor s 1 r c b r proj c b s proj 31 proof by the proof of lemma 5 2 we have a factorisation of the functor p r c b r proj c b b proj as c b r proj g w b f c b b proj such that k g k r k w b is a homotopy equivalence where f w b c b b proj is the inclusion since m m is a homological exact context the ring homomorphism b c is a homo logical noncommutative localization by lemma 5 3 then it follows from lemma 5 1 that there is a weak homotopy fibration k w b k f k b k k c next we simplify k b and k c up to homotopy equivalence indeed let i s t b be the inclusion and let j b s t b m be the projection since b is a triangular matrix ring with s and t in the diagonal it is known that the ring homomorphisms i and j induce inverse homotopy equivalences k i k s k t k b and k j k b k s k t for a proof of this result using waldhausen k theory one may refer to the proof of 30 proposition 5 7 iv where the additivity theorem for quillen k theory see 37 proposition 1 3 2 4 was applied note that the isomorphisms kn b kn s kn t were first obtained by berrick and keating see 2 now we define e 1 0 0 0 c and t r s since the functor ec c c proj proj is an equivalence of categories we see that k ec c k c k moreover there are the following natural isomorphisms of exact functors b m b p r s 1 r t r c b r proj c b s proj c b t proj ec b c b b s t s t s proj t proj proj with the above preparations we can construct the following commutative diagram of k theory spaces up to homotopy equivalence k w b k f k b k j k k c k ec c k r k g oo k k k s k t k k pp pp pp pp pp pp k i yy k k k k k k 88 q q qq q q q q qq where k is the map induced from the coproduct functor proj proj proj note that the first row is a weak homotopy fibration this means that the second row is also a weak homotopy fibration thus the proof is completed as a byproduct of lemma 5 4 we have the following corollary which says that although the multipli cation of the noncommutative tensor product t r s of a homological exact context m m depends on the pair m m the loop space of the k theory space of t r s is independent of the pair m m up to homotopy equivalence for definitions of loop spaces and homotopy fibres we refer the reader to section 3 1 for details 32 corollary 5 5 let m m be a homological exact context then the loop space k t r s of the k theory space k t r s is homotopy equivalent to the homotopy fibre of the map k k k r k s k t proof of theorem 1 3 1 note that the long exact sequence of k groups in 1 is exactly the one of homotopy groups see section 3 1 induced from the weak homotopy fibration in lemma 5 4 2 recall that we have a recollement of derived module categories described in lemma 5 3 due to corollary 1 2 in order to show 2 it is sufficient to prove that bc respectively cb has a finite type resolu tion if and only if so is rs respectively tr in fact bc has a finite type resolution if and only if bc d c b applying lemma 2 2 3 to the recollement in lemma 5 3 we see that d c bc dc b if and only if j b dc r however j b hom b p b s con 1 d r where con stands for the two term complex 0 r s 0 with r of degree 1 this implies that j b dc r if and only if rs d c r while the latter is equivalent to saying that rs has a finite type resolution thus bc has a finite type resolution if and only if so is rs note that for the ring homomorphisms op rop t op and op rop sop of opposite rings the quadru ple op op t op msop m is also a homological exact context in a similar way we can show that cb has a finite type resolution if and only if so is tr proof of corollary 1 4 since i 1 i 2 is an exact pair we know from 6 remark 5 2 that r 2 r r 1 is isomorphic to the coproduct r 1 r r 2 we can check however that r 1 r r 2 is isomorphic to r see also 7 lemma 2 3 thus corollary 1 4 follows immediately from theorem 1 3 1 proof of corollary 1 5 let r s be the inclusion s s r the canonical surjection and r s the induced map by right multiplication recall from 6 section 3 that the quadruple homr s s r is an exact context so the noncommutative tensor product s r s of this exact context is well defined assume that rs is finitely generated and projective then torri s s 0 for all i 1 this means that this exact context is homological now corollary 1 5 follows from theorem 1 3 2 as a consequence of theorem 1 3 1 we reobtain the following result of karoubi 39 chapter v propo sition 7 5 2 corollary 5 6 let a and b be arbitrary rings and let f a b be a ring homomorphism and a central multiplicatively closed set of nonzerodivisors in a such that the image of under f is a central set of nonzerodivisors in b assume that f induces a ring isomorphism a sa b sb for each s then there is a mayer vietoris sequence kn 1 1 b kn a kn 1 a kn b kn 1 b kn 1 a k 0 a k 0 1 a k 0 b k 0 1 b for all n n where 1 a stands for the localization of a at proof define r a s 1 a t b and f let r s be the canonical map of the localization by 4 lemma 6 2 we have s r t 1 b which is defined by the canonical maps 1 a 1 b and b 1 b since and f do not contain zerodivisors both and are injective as the modules a 1 a and b 1 b are flat both and are homological ring epimorphisms 33 now we claim that is an exact pair to show this we first prove that the following well defined map h 1 a a b 1 b a s b 7 a f b s f for a a s and b b is an isomorphism of 1 a b bimodules in fact since 1 a lim s s 1 a where s 1 a a s a a 1 a we have 1 a a b lim s s 1 a a b lim s s 1 a a b lim s s f 1 b 1 b next we show that the cokernels of and are isomorphic as a modules actually 1 a a lim s s 1 a a lim s s 1 a a lim s a sa similarly 1 b b lim s b sb since a sa b sb for each s the map f induces an isomorphism of a modules 1 a a 1 b b that is coker coker finally we point out that the map b 1 a a b defined by b 7 1 b for b b is injective and that coker coker this is due to the equality h thus 0 a 1 a b 1 a a b 0 is an exact sequence of a modules where 1 a 1 a a b is defined by x 7 x 1 for x 1 a by definition the pair is exact since consists of central nonzerodivisor elements in a the a module 1 a is flat this implies that torai b 1 a 0 for all i 0 and therefore corollary 5 6 follows from theorem 1 3 1 immediately 5 2 k theory of free products of groups finally we apply theorem 1 3 to algebraic k theory of group rings as a preparation we first recall some definitions and results from 38 6 about pure extensions recall that an extension r c of rings is called pure if there exists a spliting c r x of r r bimodules the actual splitting is not part of the data just its existence in general the r r bimodule x may not be unique for example for a group g the canonical embedding r rg is pure in this case x has two natural choices one is the free r submodule of rg generated by the nonidentity elements of g the other is the kernel of the canonical surjective ring homomorphism g rg r g g rgg 7 g rg where rg r the latter motivates the following definition a pure extension r c is said to be strictly pure if the r r bimodule x is even a c c bimodule in other words x is an ideal of c such that the composite of the inclusion r c with the canonical surjection c c x is the identity map pure extensions were originally used by waldhausen to study algebraic k theory of generalized free products in 38 now we briefly recall some of the results there let r c and r d be two pure extensions of rings we denote by c r d the coproduct of and in the category of r rings in 38 coproducts of rings were called generalized free products note that and give rise to a map k k k r k c k d 34 of k theory spaces where k denotes the map k d 1 r k r k d induced from the functor d 1 r c b r proj c b d proj since k 1 k r k r is a homotopy equivalence and a homo topy inverse of k r see the statements at the end of subsection 3 2 we see that both k k and k k have the same homotopy fibre up to homotopy equivalence further we fix two split decompositions of r r bimodules c r x and d r y in order to describe the k theory space of the coproduct c r d waldhausen introduced a topological space k nil r x y in 38 of which the homotopy type depends only on the ring r and the r bimodules x and y for the original definition of k nil r x y we refer to 38 page 217 for further explanations of this space one may find in 29 section 2 4 and 11 section 0 2 the n th algebraic k group of k nil r x y usually called the n th reduced nilgroup will be simply denoted by n iln r x y lemma 5 7 38 theorem 1 and theorem 4 suppose that x and y are free right r modules then the loop space k c r d of the k theory space of the ring c r d is the direct product up to homotopy of the space k nil r x y and of the homotopy fibre of the map k k moreover if the ring r is regular coherent then the space k nil r x y is contractible from the first part of lemma 5 7 we obtain the following mayer vietoris exact sequence of k groups kn r n iln r x y kn c kn d kn c r d kn 1 r n iln 1 r x y k 1 r n il 1 r x y k 1 c k 1 d k 1 c r d k 0 r n il 0 r x y k 0 c k 0 d where kn c r d n iln 1 r x y is a split surjection for n 1 now let us reveal how the homotopy fibre of the map k k can be related to noncommutative tension products when and are strictly pure this is based on a construction of exact contexts in 6 section 4 2 2 assume that and are strictly pure then the pair can be completed into an exact context in the following way let m r x y the direct sum of abelian groups we endow m with the following multiplication r 1 x 1 y 1 r 2 x 2 y 2 r 1 r 2 r 1 x 2 x 1 r 2 x 1 x 2 r 1 y 2 y 1 r 2 y 1 y 2 for ri r xi x and yi y with i 1 2 under this multiplication m is a ring with identity 1 and contains both c and d as subrings moreover the quadruple m 1 is an exact context now we identify the noncommutative tensor product d r c with r x y y r x as r r bimodules then the multiplication of d r c is given by r 1 x 1 y 1 y 3 x 3 r 2 x 2 y 2 y 4 x 4 r 1 r 2 r 1 x 2 x 1 r 2 x 1 x 2 r 1 y 2 y 1 r 2 y 1 y 2 y 1 x 2 y 3 x 3 r 2 r 1 y 4 x 4 y 1 y 4 x 4 y 3 x 3 x 2 where r 1 r 2 r xi x and yi y for 1 i 4 note that m 1 is homological if and only if torri y x 0 for all i 1 in particular m 1 is homological if yr or rx is free in this case by corollary 5 5 the homotopy fibre of the map k k k r k c k d and thus also the map k k is homotopy equivalent to the loop space k d r c so the following result follows immediately from lemma 5 7 corollary 5 5 and the fact that c r d d r c as rings 35 corollary 5 8 let r c and r d be strictly pure such that x and y are free right r modules then the following hold 1 there is a homotopy equivalence k c r d k nil r x y k d r c in particular kn c r d n iln 1 r x y kn d r c for n 1 2 if r is regular coherent then there are homotopy equivalences k c r d k d r c k c r d in particular kn c r d kn d r c kn c r d for n 1 now let us consider pure extensions from group rings suppose that h and g are two groups let rh and rg be the group rings of h and g over r respectively we take c rg and d rh let and be the canonical inclusions then and are strictly pure let x and y be the kernels of the ring homomorphisms g rg r and h rh r respectively then rg r x and rh r y as r r bimodules note that y and x are free r modules with r basis h 1 h h eh and g 1 g g eg respectively where eg denotes the identity of the group g in this case the multiplication of the ring rh r rg is exactly the one defined in section 1 we leave checking the details to the reader note that the construction of rh r rg still makes sense if both h and g are semigroups with identity element proof of corollary 1 6 let g be the category of groups and let r be the category of r rings recall that an r ring is a ring u with identity and a ring homomorphism from r to u preserving identity the group ring functor r g r g 7 rg for g g is left adjoint to the functor which sends an r ring to its group of invertible elements so the functor r preserves coproducts since the group h g is the coproduct of h and g in the category g we see that r h g is the coproduct of rh and rg in the category r thus r h g rh r rg now corollary 1 6 follows from corollary 5 8 2 finally we apply corollary 1 6 to fundamental groups of topological spaces let u be a topological space which is the union of two open and path connected subspaces u 1 and u 2 suppose that v u 1 u 2 is path connected and nonempty let x v be a point we consider the fundamental groups 1 u 1 u 1 1 u 2 and 1 v of u u 1 u 2 and v at x by the seifert van kampen theorem the diagram of fundamental groups 1 v 1 u 1 1 u 2 1 u is a pushout in the category of groups let r 1 u be the group ring of 1 u over the ring r as a consequence of corollary 1 6 we have the following result corollary 5 9 let r be a regular coherent ring for example the ring z of integers suppose that 1 v is trivial then kn r 1 u kn r 1 u 2 r r 1 u 1 kn r 1 u 1 r r 1 u 2 for all n 1 36 remark 5 10 corollaries 1 6 5 8 and 5 9 can be applied to some cases considered in 29 11 for example for an arbitrary ring r we have kn r d kn rz 2 r rz 2 n iln 1 r where z 2 is the group of order 2 in fact we know that d z 2 z 2 and r z 2 z 2 rz 2 r rz 2 it follows from corollary 5 8 1 that kn r d kn rz 2 r rz 2 n iln 1 r r r for n 1 note that n il r r r n il r by 11 corollary 3 27 1 where the reduced nilgroups n il r appears in algebraic k groups of the polynomial ring r x with one variable x k r x k r n il 1 r thus kn r d kn rz 2 r rz 2 n iln 1 r as desired this is different from the decomposition kn r d kn rz 2 kn rz 2 kn r n iln 1 r given in 11 corollary 3 27 2 we have considered strictly pure extensions in this section by using exact contexts now we mention the following open question for arbitrary pure extensions question let r c and r d be pure extensions such that x and y are free right r modules how can one describe the homotopy fibre of the map k k k r k c k d in terms of algebraic k theory space of a ring acknowledgements both
