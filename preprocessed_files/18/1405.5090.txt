dimensions of algebras linked by recollements of derived module categories and establish a series of new upper bounds and relationships among their finitistic or global dimensions this is closely related to a longstanding conjecture the finitistic dimension conjecture in representation theory and homological algebra further we apply our results to a series of situations of particular interest exact contexts ring extensions trivial extensions pullbacks of rings and algebras induced from auslander reiten sequences in particular we not only extend and amplify happel s re duction techniques for finitistic dimenson conjecture to more general contexts but also generalise some recent results in the literature contents 1 introduction 1 2 definitions and conventions 5 3 proofs 7 3 1

triangulated categories have been introduced by beilinson bernstein and deligne in order to decompose derived categories of sheaves into two parts an open and a closed one see 6 and thus providing a natural habitat for grothendieck s six functors similarly recollements of derived module categories can be seen as short exact sequences describing a derived module category in terms of a subcategory and of a quotient both of which may be derived module categories themselves related by six functors that in general are not known it turns out that recollements provide a very useful framework for understanding connections among three algebraic or geometric objects in which one is interested in a series of papers on recollements of derived module categories we are addressing basic questions about recollements and the rings involved our starting point has been infinite dimensional tilting theory see 7 while happel s theorem establishes a derived equivalence between a given ring and the endomorphism ring of a finitely generated tilting object see 15 13 bazzoni has shown that for large tilting modules one gets instead a recollement relating three triangulated categories with two of them being the derived categories of the given ring and the endomorphism ring of the large tilting module in 7 we have addressed the question of determining the third category in this recollement as a derived category of a ring and we have explained this ring in terms of universal localisations in the sense of cohn see 12 20 for definition among the applications has been a counterexample to the jordan ho lder problem for derived module categories in 8 we have dealt with the problem of constructing recollements in order to relate rings our main construction of exact contexts can be seen as a far reaching generalisation of pullbacks of rings in 9 we have used this corresponding author email xicc cnu edu cn fax 86 10 68903637 2010 mathematics subject classification primary 18 e 30 16 g 10

theory of different rings it turned out that under mild assumptions the k theory of an algebra can be fully decomposed under a sequence of recollements for cohomology and for homological invariants of algebras such a complete decomposition is not pos sible nevertheless results by happel in 16 for the case of bounded derived categories when fewer rec ollements exist than in the unbounded case show that finiteness of finitistic dimension of an algebra can be reduced along a recollement if such an invariant is finite for the two outer terms then it is finite for the middle term too note that the particular values of these invariants depend on the ring and are not invariants of the derived category the present paper aims at extending happel s reduction techniques for homological conjectures as in happel s paper 16 we will focus on finitistic dimensions which include finite global dimensions as a special case recall that the finitistic dimension of a ring r denoted by fin dim r is by definition the supremum of projective dimensions of those left r modules having a finite projective resolution by finitely generated projective modules the well known finitistic dimension conjecture states that any artin algebra should have finite finitistic dimension see for instance 3 conjecture 11 p 410 this conjecture is a longstanding question 4 bass 1960 and has still not been settled it is closely related to at least seven other main conjectures in homological representation theory of algebras see 3 p 409 410 in the literature there is another definition of big finitistic dimension of a ring r denoted by fin dim r which is the supre mum of projective dimensions of all those left r modules which have finite projective dimension clearly fin dim r fin dim r usually they are quite different see 26 there are two main directions in this article first we provide reduction techniques for homological invariants of unbounded derived module categories that is for the most general possible setup which also has been covered in the preceding articles in this series in the first main result theorem 1 1 we give criteria for the finiteness of finitistic dimension for each of the three rings in a recollement of derived module categories in terms of the other two the criteria aim to be applicable by putting conditions on particular objects not on the whole category the second main result theorem 1 2 applies the first main result to the general contexts of the so called exact contexts introduced in 7 and in addition provides upper and lower bounds for the finitistic dimensions of the three rings involved a series of corollaries then applies the general results to classes of examples of particular interest such as ring extensions trivial extensions quotient rings and endomorphism rings of modules related by an almost split sequence theorem 1 1 let r 1 r 2 and r 3 be rings suppose that there exists a recollement among the derived module categories d r 3 d r 2 and d r 1 of r 3 r 2 and r 1 d r 1 i d r 2 j i ff i xx d r 3 j ff j xx then the following hold true 1 suppose that j restricts to a functor d b r 3 d b r 2 of bounded derived module categories if fin dim r 2 then fin dim r 3 2 suppose that i r 1 is a compact object in d r 2 then we have the following a if fin dim r 2 then fin dim r 1 b if fin dim r 1 and fin dim r 3 then fin dim r 2 note that the assumption of theorem 1 1 on unbounded derived module categories is weaker than the one on bounded derived module categories because the existence of recollements of bounded derived module categories implies the one of unbounded derived module categories this is shown by a recent investigation on recollements at different levels in 2 18 so theorem 1 1 see also corollary 3 13 generalizes the main result in 16 since for a recollement of db r j mod with r j a finite dimensional algebra over a field for 1 j 3 one can always deduce that i r 1 is compact in d r 2 moreover theorem 1 1 extends 2 and amplifies a result in 25 because we deal with arbitrary rings instead of artin algebras and also yields a generalization of a result in 22 for left coherent rings to the one for arbitrary rings see corollary 3 9 below to prove this result we introduce homological widths or cowidth for complexes that are quasi isomorphic to bounded complexes of projective or injective modules see section 3 1 for details broadly speaking the homological width respectively cowidth defines a map from homotopy equivalence classes of bounded complexes of projective respectively injective modules to the natural numbers it measures up to ho motopy equivalence how large the minimal interval of such a complex is in which its non zero terms are distributed particularly if a module has finite projective dimension then its homological width is exactly the projective dimension using homological widths we will present a substantial and technical result theorem 3 11 which is a strengthened version of theorem 1 1 and describes explicitly upper bounds for finitistic dimensions so that theorem 1 1 will become an easy consequence of theorem 3 11 note that in 16 one of the key arguments in proofs is that finite dimensional algebras have finitely many non isomorphic simple modules while in our general context we do not have this fact and therefore must avoid this kind of argu ments so the idea of proving theorems 3 11 and 1 1 will be completely different from the ones in 16 and 25 moreover our methods also lead to results on upper bounds for big finitistic and global dimensions for details we refer the reader to theorems 3 17 and 3 18 now let us utilize theorem 1 1 to recollements constructed in 8 and establish relationships among finitistic dimensions of noncommutative tensor products and related rings first of all we recall some notions from 8 let r s and t be associative rings with identity and let r s and r t be ring homomorphisms suppose that m is an s t bimodule together with an element m m we say that the quadruple m m is an exact context if the following sequence 0 r s t m m m 0 is an exact sequence of abelian groups where m and m denote the right and left multiplication by m maps respectively there is a list of examples in 8 that guarantees the ubiquity of exact contexts given an exact context m m there is defined a ring with identity in 8 called the noncommutative tensor product of m m and denoted by t r s if the meaning of the exact context is clear this notion not only generalizes the one of usual tensor products over commutative rings and captures coproducts of rings but also plays a key role in describing the left parts of recollements induced from homological exact contexts see 8 theorem 1 1 for an r module rx we denote by flat dim rx and proj dim rx the flat and projective dimensions of x respectively from the proof of theorem 1 1 or theorem 3 11 we have the following result theorem 1 2 let m m be an exact context with the noncommutative tensor product t r s then 1 fin dim r fin dim s fin dim t max 1 flat dim tr 1 2 suppose that torri t s 0 for all i 1 if the left r module rs has a finite projective resolution by finitely generated projective modules then the following hold true a fin dim t r s fin dim s fin dim t 1 b fin dim s fin dim s m 0 t fin dim r fin dim t r s max 1 proj dim rs 3 note that for the triangular matrix algebra b s m 0 t it is known that fin dim b fin dim s fin dim t 1 but theorem 1 2 2 b provides us with a new upper bound for the finitistic dimension of b that is the finiteness of fin dim b can be seen from the one of fin dim t r s and fin dim r involving the starting ring r but without information on fin dim s and fin dim t this is non trivial and somewhat surprising moreover in theorem 1 2 2 if r s is a homological ring epimorphism then we even 3 obtain better estimations fin dim s fin dim r and fin dim t r s fin dim t in this case t r s can be interpreted as the coproduct s r t of the r rings of s and t now let us state several consequences of theorem 1 2 first we utilize theorem 1 2 to finitistic di mensions of ring extensions this is of particular interest because the finitistic dimension conjecture can be reformulated over perfect fields in terms of ring extensions see 24 note that in the following result we do not impose any conditions on the radicals of rings comparing with 23 24 corollary 1 3 suppose that s r is an extension of rings that is s is a subring of r with the same identity let r be the endomorphism ring of the s module r s and let r s r be the noncommutative tensor product of the exact context determined the extension then 1 fin dim s fin dim r fin dim r max 1 flat dim r s s flat dim homs r r s s 1 2 suppose that the left s module r is projective and finitely generated then the following hold true a fin dim r s r fin dim r fin dim r 1 b fin dim r fin dim s fin dim r s r 4 next we apply theorem 1 2 to trivial extensions recall that given a ring r and an r r bimodule m the trivial extension of r by m is a ring denoted by r m with abelian group r m and multiplication r m r m rr rm mr for r r r and m m m for consideration of fin dim r m we refer the reader to 14 chapter 4 corollary 1 4 let r s be a ring epimorphism and m an s s bimodule such that torri m s 0 for all i 1 if rs has a finite projective resolution by finitely generated projective r modules then a fin dim s m fin dim s fin dim r m 1 b fin dim s fin dim r fin dim s m now we apply theorem 1 2 to pullback squares of rings and surjective homomorphisms corollary 1 5 let r be a ring and let i 1 and i 2 be ideals of r such that i 1 i 2 0 then 1 fin dim r fin dim r i 1 fin dim r i 2 max 1 flat dim r i 2 r 1 2 suppose that torri i 2 i 1 0 for all i 0 if the left r module r i 1 has a finite projective resolution by finitely generated projective modules then a fin dim r i 1 i 2 fin dim r i 1 fin dim r i 2 1 b fin dim r i 1 fin dim r fin dim r i 1 i 2 max 1 proj dim r r i 1 3 the strategy of proving corollaries 1 4 and 1 5 is as follows first we show that under the given assump tions we can get exact pairs a class of special exact contexts and then employ theorem 1 2 by verifying the tor vanishing condition at last we have to describe noncommutative tensor products more substantially for the cases considered finally we mention a corollary on finitistic dimensions of algebras arising from idempotent ideals and almost split sequences see 3 for definition corollary 1 6 1 if i is an idempotent ideal in a ring r then fin dim r i fin dim endr r i fin dim endr ri fin dim r i 2 2 let 0 z y x 0 be an almost split sequence of r modules with r an artin algebra if homr y z 0 then fin dim endr y x fin dim endr y 2 the paper is sketched as follows in section 2 we first recall some necessary definitions and then prove two results on coproducts of rings in section 3 we provide all proofs of our results especially we introduce homological widths of complexes and prove an amplified version theorem 3 11 of theorem 1 1 phrased in terms of homological widths and finitistic dimensions of involved rings such that theorem 1 1 is deduced readily from theorem 3 11 moreover the methods developed in this section also give similar upper bounds for global and big finitistic dimensions see theorems 3 17 and 3 18 4 2 definitions and conventions in this section we fix notation and briefly recall some definitions for unexplained ones we refer the reader to 8 9 throughout the paper all notation and terminology are standard for example by a ring we mean an associative ring with identity for a ring r we denote by r mod the category of all left r modues and by c r k r and d r the unbounded complex homotopy and derived categories of r mod respectively as usual by adding a superscript b we denote their corresponding bounded categories for instance db r is the bounded derived category of r mod the full subcategory of compact objects in d r is denoted by dc r this category is also called the perfect derived module category of r it is known that the localization functor k r d r induces a triangle equivalence from the homotopy category of bounded complexes of finitely generated projective r modules to dc r as usual we write a complex in c r as x x i dix i z and call d i x x i x i 1 the i th differential of x sometimes for simplicity we shall write x i i z for x without mentioning the morphisms dix given a chain map f x y in c r its mapping cone is denoted by con f for an integer n the n th cohomology of x is denoted by hn x let sup x and inf x be the supremum and minimum of indices i z such that h i x 6 0 respectively if x is acyclic that is h i x 0 for all i z then we understand that sup x and inf x if x is not acyclic then inf x sup x and hn x 0 if sup x is an integer and n sup x or if inf x is an integer and n inf x for a complex x in c r if hn x 0 for almost all n then x is isomorphic in d r to a bounded complex so db r is equivalent to the full subcategory of d r consisting of all complexes with finitely many nonzero cohomologies as a convention we write the composite of two homomorphisms f x y and g y z in r mod as f g thus the image of an element x x under f will be written on the opposite of the scalars as x f instead of f x this convention makes homr x y naturally a left endr x and right endr y bimodule but for two functors f x y and g y z of categories we write gf x z for their composition let us now recall the notion of recollements of triangulated categories which was defined by beilinson bernstein and deligne in 6 to study derived categories of perverse sheaves over singular spaces it may be thought as a kind of categorifications of exact sequences in abelian categories definition 2 1 let d d and d be triangulated categories we say that d is a recollement of d and d if there are six triangle functors among the three categories d i i d j j i i d j j such that 1 i i i i j j and j j are adjoint pairs 2 i j and j are fully faithful functors 3 j i 0 and thus also i j 0 and i j 0 and 4 for each object x d there are two triangles in d induced by counit and unit adjunctions i i x x j j x i i x 1 j j x x i i x j j x 1 where the shift functor of triangulated categories is denoted by 1 recall that the coproduct of a family ri i i of r 0 rings with i an index set is defined to be an r 0 ring r together with a family i ri r i i of r 0 homomorphisms of rings such that for any r 0 ring s with 5 a family of r 0 homomorphisms i ri s i i there exists a unique r 0 homomorphism r s such that i i for all i i it is well known that coproducts of rings exist see 11 however this existence result does not provide us with a handy form of coproducts therefore we need a concrete description of coproducts for our situations considered in the following we describe coproducts of rings for two cases in terms of some known constructions this will be used in later proofs the first one is for trivial extensions lemma 2 2 suppose that r s is a ring epimorphism and m is an s s bimodule let r m s m be the ring homomorphism induced by then the coproduct s r r m is isomorphic to s m that is the inclusion s s m and define the coproduct proof let r r m and s s m be the inclusions of rings note that s and r m are r rings via and respectively and that r s m to prove that s m together with and is the coproduct of s and r m over r we suppose that is an arbitrary ring and that f r m and g s are arbitrary ring homomorphisms such that g f then we have to show that there is a unique ring homomorphism h s m such that h f and h g clearly if such an h exists then h must be defined by s m 7 m f s g for s s and m m this shows the uniqueness of h so it suffices to show that the above defined map h is a ring homomorphism certainly h is a homomorphism of abelian groups hence we have to show that h preserves multiplication let si s and mi m for i 1 2 on the one hand s 1 m 1 s 2 m 2 h s 1 s 2 s 1 m 2 m 1 s 2 h s 1 m 2 m 1 s 2 f s 1 s 2 g s 1 m 2 f m 1 s 2 f s 1 g s 2 g on the other hand s 1 m 1 h s 2 m 2 h m 1 f s 1 g m 2 f s 2 g m 1 f m 2 f m 1 f s 2 g s 1 g m 2 f s 1 g s 2 g m 1 m 2 f m 1 f s 2 g s 1 g m 2 f s 1 g s 2 g m 1 f s 2 g s 1 g m 2 f s 1 g s 2 g since m 1 m 2 0 this implies that if s 1 m 2 f s 1 g m 2 f and m 1 s 2 f m 1 f s 2 g then s 1 m 1 s 2 m 2 h s 1 m 1 h s 2 m 2 h so to prove that h preserves multiplication we need only to verify these additional conditions that is sm f s g m f and ms f m f s g for s s and m m to show the former we fix an m m and define two maps s s 7 sm f and s s 7 s g m f since g f one can check that both and are homomorphisms of r modules such that but we do not know if they are homomorphisms of rings nevertheless we can still have because r s being a ring epimorphism by assumption implies that the map homr r homr s homr r is an isomorphism and therefore it is injective thus similarly we can show that ms f m f s g consequently the map h preserves multiplication and is actually a ring homomorphism the other description of coproducts is for quotients of rings by ideals which applies to milnor squares see 19 lemma 2 3 let r 0 be a ring and let ri be an r 0 ring with ring homomorphism i r 0 ri for i 1 2 1 if 1 r 0 r 1 is a ring epimorphism then so is the canonical homomorphism 2 r 2 r 1 r 0 r 2 2 let i be an ideal of r 0 and let j be the ideal of r 2 generated by the image i 2 of i under the map 2 if r 1 r 0 i and 1 r 0 r 1 is the canonical surjective map then r 1 r 0 r 2 r 2 j proof 1 it follows from the definition of coproducts of rings that 1 1 2 2 r 0 r 1 r 0 r 2 we point out that 2 is a ring epimorphism in fact if f g r 1 r 0 r 2 s are two ring homomorphisms such that 2 f 2 g then 2 2 f 2 2 g this means that 1 1 f 1 1 g and therefore 1 f 1 g since 1 is a ring epimorphism by the universal property of coproducts we have g f thus 2 is a ring epimorphism 2 let 2 r 2 r 2 j be the canonical surjection and let 1 r 1 r 2 j be the ring homomorphism induced by 2 since j r 2 i 2 r 2 i 2 now we claim that r 2 j together with 1 and 2 is the coproduct of r 1 and r 2 over r 0 clearly we have 1 1 2 2 r 0 r 2 j further assume that 1 r 1 s 6 and 2 r 2 s are two ring homomorphisms such that 2 2 1 1 then i 2 2 i 1 1 0 and therefore j 2 0 this means that there is a unique ring homomorphism r 2 j s such that 2 2 it follows that 1 1 2 2 2 2 1 1 since 1 is surjective we have 1 1 this shows that r 1 r 0 r 2 r 2 j 3 proofs this section is devoted to proofs of all results mentioned in the introduction we start with introducing the so called homological widths for complexes and then prove a strengthened version theorem 3 11 below of theorem 1 1 as consequences of theorem 3 11 we get proofs of theorems 1 1 and 1 2 finally we apply theorem 1 2 to give proofs of all corollaries and mention two results on global and big finitistic dimensions 3 1 homological widths and cowidths of complexes as a generalization of finite projective or injective dimensions of modules we define in this subsection homological widths and cowidths for bounded complexes of projective and injective modules respectively let r be a ring for an r module m we denote by proj dim m inj dim m and flat dim m the pro jective injective and flat dimension of m respectively as usual r proj is the category of all projective left r modules and r proj is the full subcategory of r proj consisting of all finitely generated projective left r modules if there is a projective resolution 0 pn p 1 p 0 m 0 of m with all pi in r proj then we say that m is of finite type the category of all r modules of finite type will be denoted by p r let p pn dnp n z c b r proj we define the homological width of p in the following way w p 0 if p is acyclic sup p inf p proj dim cok d inf p 1 p otherwise clearly 0 w p moreover p is isomorphic in k b r proj to a complex q 0 qt p dt p qt p 1 dt p 1 qt 1 dt 1 qt pt 1 dt 1 p ps 1 ds 1 p ker dsp 0 with s sup p t inf p p proj dim cok dt 1 p and each term being projective clearly the sequence 0 qt p dt p qt p 1 dt p 1 qt 1 dt 1 qt cok dt 1 p 0 is a projective resolution of the r module cok dt 1 p note that if p c b r proj we can choose q c b r proj the following result says that homological widths of bounded complexes of projective modules are pre served under homotopy equivalences lemma 3 1 let m n c b r proj if m n in k b r proj then w m w n proof recall that k b r proj is the stable category of the frobenius category c b r proj with projec tive objects being acyclic complexes assume that m n in k b r proj then there exist two acyclic complexes p and q in c b r proj such that m p n q in c b r proj this implies that h i m h i n and cok dim cok d i p cok d i n cok d i q for all i z thus sup m sup n and inf m inf n moreover since cok dip and cok d i q belong to r proj we have proj dim cok dim proj dim cok din it follows that w m w n thanks to lemma 3 1 the definition of homological widths for complexes can be extended slightly to derived categories in the following sense given a complex x d r if there is a complex p c b r proj such that x p in d r then we define w x w p this is well defined if there exists another 7 complex q c b r proj such that x q in d r then p q in k b r proj and w p w q by lemma 3 1 so for such a complex x its homological width w x can be characterized as follows w x min p p 0 p x in d r for p c b r proj with pi 0 for i p or i p clearly if x r mod has finite projective dimension then w x proj dim x dually we can define homological cowidths for bounded complexes of injective r modules let r inj denote the category of injective r modules given a complex i in dni n z c b r inj we define the homological cowidth of i as follows cw i 0 if i is acyclic sup i inf i inj dim ker d sup i i otherwise similarly if a complex y is isomorphic in d r to a bounded complex i c b r inj then we define cw y cw i in particular if y r mod has finite injective dimension then cw y inj dim y also we have the following characterization of cw y cw y min i i 0 i y in d r for i c b r inj with ii 0 for i i or i i homological widths and cowidths will be used to bound homological dimensions in the next section 3 2 proof of theoem 1 1 in this subsection we shall first prove an amplified version of theorem 1 1 namely theorem 3 11 below so that theorem 1 1 becomes a straightforward consequence of theorem 3 11 recall that the finitistic dimension of a ring r denoted by fin dim r is defined as follows fin dim r sup proj dim rx x p r for each n z we define d c n r x dc r x p in dc r with p c b r proj such that pi 0 for all i n from this definition we have dc n r d c n r whenever n n since the localization functor k r d r induces a triangle equivalence k b r proj dc r we have d c r n z d c n r clearly if fin dim r m then p r dc m r for the convenience of later discussions we also formally set dc r d c r and dc r 0 lemma 3 2 let m n n then the following statements are true 1 the full subcategory dc n r of d c r is closed under direct summands in dc r 2 let x dc n r z dc m r and s min n m then for any distinguished triangle x y z x 1 in dc r we have y dc s r proof 1 let m k b r proj and let n n i i z k b r proj such that n i 0 for all i n suppose that m is a direct summand of n in k b r proj or equivalently there is a complex l c b r proj such that m l n in k b r proj hence h i m 0 for all i n note that k b r proj is the stable category of the frobenius category c b r proj with projective objects being acyclic complexes 8 so we can find two acyclic complexes u and v in c b r proj such that m l u n v in c b r proj this implies that cok dn 1 m cok d n 1 l cok d n 1 u cok d n 1 n cok d n 1 v n n cok dn 1 v since nn cok dn 1 v r proj we have cok d n 1 m r proj it follows that m is isomorphic in k b r proj to the following truncated complex 0 cok dn 1 m m n 1 mn 2 0 recall that the localization functor k r d r induces a triangle equivalence k b r proj dc r thus 1 follows 2 since x dc n r there exists a complex p c b r proj with pi 0 for i n such that x p in dc r similarly there exists another complex q c b r proj with qi 0 for i m such that z q in dc r it follows from the triangle equivalence k b r proj dc r that hom k b r proj q 1 p homdc r q 1 p homdc r z 1 x thus the given triangle yields a distinguished triangle in dc r q 1 f p y q with f a chain map in c r then y con f in dc r since con f i qi pi for any i z we have con f c b r proj and con f i 0 for i s this implies y dc s r to investigate relationships among finitistic dimensions of rings in recollements it may be convenient to introduce the notion of finitistic dimensions of functors let r 1 and r 2 be two arbitrary rings suppose that x 1 and x 2 are full subcategories of d r 1 and d r 2 respectively and that r 1 mod x 1 for a given additive functor f x 1 x 2 we define inf f inf n z hn f x 6 0 for some x r 1 mod fin dim f inf n z hn f x 6 0 for some x p r 1 note that inf f if and only if f x 0 in d r 2 for all x r 1 mod in fact if there exits some x r 1 mod such that h n f x 6 0 for some integer n then inf f n moreover by definition we always have inf f fin dim f and fin dim f z lemma 3 3 let f d r 1 d r 2 be a triangle functor then the following statements are true 1 if f has a left adjoint l d r 2 d r 1 with l r 2 d r 1 then inf f sup l r 2 2 if f has a right adjoint g d r 2 d r 1 then f restricts to a functor d b r 1 d b r 2 if and only if g homz r 2 q z is isomorphic in d r 1 to a bounded complex i of injective r 1 modules in this case inf f m inj dim ker dmi where m sup i and dmi i m im 1 is the m th differential of i proof 1 for each n z and m r 1 mod we have hn f m homd r 2 r 2 f m n homd r 1 l r 2 m n since l r 2 d r 1 we have s sup l r 2 recall that the localization functor k r 1 d r 1 induces a triangle equivalence k r 1 proj d r 1 so there is a complex p p j j z c r 1 proj with p j 0 for all j s such that p l r 2 in d r 1 it follows that hn f m homd r 1 l r 2 m n homd r 1 p m n homk r 1 p m n 0 9 for all n s thus inf f s 2 to calculate cohomologies of complexes we consider the functor homz q z z mod z mod this is an exact functor with the property that a z module u is zero if and only if so is u because q z is an injective cogenerator for z mod let x d r 2 then h 0 x homz h 0 x q z homk z x q z homk z r 2 r 2 x q z homk r 2 x r 2 since r 2 is an injective r 2 module we have homk r 2 x r 2 homd r 2 x r 2 thus h 0 x homd r 2 x r 2 now let m r 1 mod and n z then h n f m homd r 2 f m n r 2 since f g is an adjoint pair we have homd r 2 f m n r 2 homd r 1 m n g r 2 this implies that hn f m 0 if and only if homd r 1 m n g r 2 0 let w g r 2 to check the sufficiency of 2 it is enough to show that homd r 1 m n w 0 for almost all n in fact if w is isomorphic in d r 1 to a bounded complex i of injective r 1 modules then homd r 1 m n w homd r 1 m n i homk r 1 m n i 0 for almost all n in the following we will show the necessity of 2 suppose that f restricts to a functor db r 1 d b r 2 we first claim that h n w 0 for almost all n that is w db r 1 actually we have the following isomorphisms of abelian groups hn w homd r 1 r 1 g r 2 n homd r 2 f r 1 r 2 n h n f r 1 since f r 1 d b r 2 we have h n f r 1 0 for almost all n thus h n w 0 for almost all n in other words w is isomorphic in db r 1 to a bounded complex consequently there exists a lower bounded complex i of injective r 1 modules such that i w in d r 1 in particular we have h n i hn w for all n to complete the proof of the necessity of 2 it remains to show that i can be chosen to be a bounded complex note that we have the following isomorphisms homd r 2 f m r 2 n homd r 1 m w n homd r 1 m i n homk r 1 m i n as f d r 1 d r 2 restricts to a functor d b r 1 d b r 2 by assumption we get f m d b r 2 up to isomorphism in d r 2 we may assume that f m c b r 2 since r 2 is an injective r 2 module we see that homd r 2 f m r 2 n homk r 2 f m r 2 n 0 for almost all n thus homk r 1 m i n 0 for almost all n particularly there is a natural number m depending on m such that homk r 1 m i n 0 for all n m we may suppose that the complex i is of the following form 0 is ds is 1 ds 1 im dm im 1 dm 1 ii di ii 1 where all terms ii are injective and where s m sup i and h i i 0 for any i m let v i m im d i then homk r 1 v i n 0 for all n v now we define t max m v then homk r 1 im d t i t 1 0 this implies that the chain map im dt i t 1 induced from the inclusion im dt it 1 is homotopic to the zero map therefore the 10 canonical surjection it im dt must split with it then also im dt is an injective module since h i i 0 for any i m we see that i is isomorphic in d r 1 to the following bounded complex 0 is ds is 1 ds 1 im dm im 1 dm 1 it dt im dt 0 with all of its terms being injective thus up to isomorphism in d r 1 we can choose i to be a bounded complex of injective modules this completes the proof of the necessity of 2 to show the last statement of 2 we note that the r 1 module ker d m has a finite injective resolution since h i i 0 for all i m hence up to isomorphism in d r 1 we can replace i by the following bounded complex of injective r 1 modules 0 is ds is 1 ds 1 im 1 i m d m i m 1 d m 1 i m p 1 d m p 1 i m p 0 where ker d m ker dm and p inj dim ker dm t this implies that homk r 1 m n i 0 for all n m p since hn f m homd r 1 m n w homd r 1 m n i homk r 1 m n i we have hn f m 0 for all n m p thus inf f m p we remark that in lemma 3 3 2 the r 2 module i homz r 2 q z can be replaced by any injective cogenerator of r 2 mod this is due to the fact that g always commutes with direct products recall that an r 2 module m is called a cogenerator of r 2 mod if any r 2 module can be embedded into a direct product of copies of m clearly i is an injective cogenerator of r 2 mod in case that r 2 is an artin algebra there is another injective cogenerator the usual dual module d r 2 of the right regular module r 2 where d is the usual duality of an artin algebra lemma 3 4 let f dc r 1 dc r 2 be a triangle functor suppose that fin dim f s and fin dim r 2 t then we have the following 1 f p r 1 d c s t r 2 2 let m z then for any x p r 1 and for any y d r 2 with sup y m we have homd r 2 f x y i 0 for all i t s m proof note that s if and only if f x 0 for any x p r 1 in this case both 1 and 2 are true now we assume s thus s is an integer 1 since f x dc r 2 there exists a complex q q j d j j z c b r 2 proj such that f x q in dc r 2 in particular h i f x h i q for all i z since fin dim f s we have h i f x 0 for all i s thus h i q 0 for all i s it follows that y cok ds 1 p r 2 and therefore q is isomorphic in d r 2 to the following canonical truncated complex 0 y qs 1 ds 1 qs 2 0 since fin dim r 2 t we have proj dim r 2 y t so the r 2 module y has a finite projective resolution 0 ps t ps 1 ps y 0 such that p j r 2 proj for s t j s consequently f x is isomorphic in d r 2 to the following complex p 0 ps t ps 1 ps qs 1 ds 1 qs 2 0 clearly p c b r 2 proj and p i 0 for i s t this implies f x dc s t r 2 hence we have f p r 1 d c s t r 2 2 let x p r 1 and y d r 2 with sup y m then h j y 0 for j m and therefore there exists a complex z c r 2 with z r 0 for r m such that z y in d r 2 moreover by the 11 proof of 1 there exists another complex p c b r 2 proj with p i 0 for all i s t such that p f x in d r 2 it follows that homd r 2 f x y i homd r 2 p z i homk r 2 p z i 0 for all i t s m this shows 2 lemma 3 5 let f dc r 1 dc r 2 be a fully faithful triangle functor if fin dim f s is an integer then fin dim r 1 fin dim r 2 s sup f r 1 in particular if fin dim r 2 then fin dim r 1 proof if fin dim r 2 is infinity then the right hand side of the inequality is infinity and the corollary is true so we assume that fin dim r 2 t further we may assume r 1 6 0 since f is fully faithful we have 0 6 f r 1 d c r 2 this implies that sup f r 1 moreover it is known that for any x p r 1 if there is a natural number n such that ext i r 1 x r 1 0 for all i n then proj dim r 1 x n so to show that fin dim r 1 n t s sup f r 1 it is enough to prove that extir 1 x r 1 0 for all x p r 1 and all i n in fact since f is fully faithful we see that extir 1 x r 1 homd r 1 x r 1 i homd r 2 f x f r 1 i due to lemma 3 4 2 we have homd r 2 f x f r 1 i 0 for all i n thus ext i r 1 x r 1 0 for all x p r 1 and all i n summarizing lemmas 3 3 and 3 5 together we obtain the following useful result in which w and cw denote the homological width and cowidth of a complex respectively corollary 3 6 let f d r 1 d r 2 be a fully faithful triangle functor such that f r 1 dc r 2 then the following statements hold true 1 if f has a left adjoint l d r 2 d r 1 with l r 2 d r 1 then fin dim r 1 fin dim r 2 sup l r 2 sup f r 1 if moreover l r 2 d c r 1 then fin dim r 1 fin dim r 2 w l r 2 2 if f has a right adjoint g d r 2 d r 1 and restricts to a functor d b r 1 d b r 2 then fin dim r 1 fin dim r 2 cw g homz r 2 q z proof clearly if fin dim r 2 is infinity then the two statements 1 and 2 are trivially true so we assume that fin dim r 2 t we further assume that ri 6 0 for i 1 2 by assumption we have f r 1 d c r 2 and therefore f restricts to a functor d c r 1 d c r 2 since f is fully faithful and r 1 6 0 we have f r 1 6 0 this leads to fin dim f 6 thus fin dim f z 1 since l f is an adjoint pair we have hn f r 1 homd r 2 r 2 f r 1 n homd r 1 l r 2 r 1 n it follows from 0 6 f r 1 d r 2 that l r 2 6 0 in d r 1 since l r 2 d r 1 we know that sup l r 2 is an integer by lemma 3 3 1 we see that inf f sup l r 2 and therefore fin dim f inf f combining this with lemma 3 5 we have fin dim r 1 t fin dim f sup f r 1 t sup l r 2 sup f r 1 this shows the first part of 1 for the second part of 1 we only need to check that w l r 2 sup l r 2 sup f r 1 in fact it follows from l r 2 d c r 1 that the homological width of l r 2 is well defined and there exists a complex p 0 pr dr pr 1 ps 1 ps 0 in c b r 1 proj with s sup l r 2 and s r w l r 2 such that l r 2 p in d r 1 see section 3 1 in this case dr is not a split injection since l f is an adjoint pair we have homd r 1 p r 1 n homd r 1 l r 2 r 1 n homd r 2 r 2 f r 1 n h n f r 1 12 for all n z this implies that hn f r 1 0 for all n r moreover since the map d r is not a split injection we have homd r 1 p pr r 6 0 thus h r f r 1 homd r 1 p r 1 r 6 0 this shows sup f r 1 r it follows that w l r 2 s r sup l r 2 sup f r 1 2 under the assumption of 2 we see from lemma 3 3 2 that inf f m inj dim ker dmi where i c b r 1 inj is defined in lemma 3 3 2 and m sup i thus fin dim f inf f and fin dim r 1 t m inj dim ker d m i sup f r 1 by lemma 3 5 define w g homz r 2 q z by the proof of lemma 3 3 2 we see that w i in d r 1 and that h n w h n f r 1 for all n z this implies that sup f r 1 inf w inf i thus cw w sup i inf i inj dim ker dmi m sup f r 1 inj dim ker d m i so fin dim r 1 t cw w as a consequence of corollary 3 6 we have the following applicable fact corollary 3 7 let p c r 2 z r op 1 such that r 2 p dc r 2 assume that the following conditions hold 1 r 1 endd r 2 p as rings via multiplication and homd r 2 p p n 0 for all n 6 0 2 p r 1 is isomorphic in d r op 1 to a bounded complex f 0 fr fr 1 fs 1 f s 0 of flat r op 1 modules where r s z and r s then fin dim r 1 fin dim r 2 s r in this case if fin dim r 2 then fin dim r 1 proof let f p lr 1 d r 1 d r 2 then f r 1 r 2 p dc r 2 and f has a right adjoint g rhom r 2 p d r 2 d r 1 since r 2 p dc r 2 the functor f restricts to a functor f d c r 1 d c r 2 note that the condition 1 implies that f is fully faithful further since f commutes with direct sums and d r 1 is compactly generated by r 1 we see that f itself is also fully faithful now we claim that f restricts to a functor db r 1 d b r 2 in fact by lemma 3 3 2 this is equivalent to saying that the complex g homz r 2 q z is isomorphic in d r 1 to a bounded complex of injective r 1 modules to check the latter we use the functor homz q z and apply g to the injective r 2 module r 2 then we have the following isomorphisms in d r 1 g r 2 rhomr 2 p r 2 hom r 2 p r 2 hom z r 2 r 2 p q z p note that r op 1 mod r 1 mod is an exact functor which sends flat r op 1 modules to injective r 1 modules thus the condition 2 implies that p is isomorphic in d r 1 to the following bounded complex of injective r modules f 0 f s f s 1 f r 1 fr 0 where fs and f r are of degrees s and r respectively consequently we have cw g r 2 cw p cw f s r now it follows from corollary 3 6 2 that fin dim r 1 fin dim r 2 cw g r 2 fin dim r 2 s r this completes the proof recall that a ring epimorphism r s is homological if torri s s 0 for all i 0 this is equivalent to saying that the restriction functor d d s d r is fully faithful note that d always has a left adjoint functor s lr d r d s for some new advances on homological ring epimorphisms phrased in terms of recollements of derived categories we refer the reader to 8 9 10 applying corollary 3 6 1 to homological ring epimorphisms we have the following simple result 13 corollary 3 8 let r s be a homological ring epimorphism such that rs p r then fin dim s fin dim r in this case if fin dim r then fin dim s proof if we take f d and l s lr in corollary 3 6 1 then fin dim s fin dim r w l s since w l s proj dim ss 0 we have fin dim s fin dim r let us point out a straightforward proof of corollary 3 8 let sx p s since proj dim rs the change of rings theorem implies that proj dim rx proj dim sx proj dim rs thus proj dim rx fin dim r as is homological we see that extis x y ext i r x y for all y s mod and i 0 this implies that proj dim sx proj dim rx as a result we have proj dim sx proj dim rx fin dim r this shows fin dim s fin dim r the following result extends 22 theorem 1 1 on finitistic dimensions for derived equivalences of left coherent rings to those of arbitrary rings corollary 3 9 suppose that f d r 1 d r 2 is a triangle equivalence then fin dim r 1 fin dim r 2 w f r 1 proof suppose that g d r 2 d r 1 is a quasi inverse of f then g f and f g are adjoint pairs clearly g is also a triangle equivalence since both f and g preserve compact objects they restrict to triangle equivalences of perfect derived categories f dc r 1 dc r 2 and g d c r 2 dc r 1 by corollary 3 6 1 we have fin dim r 1 fin dim r 2 w g r 2 and fin dim r 2 fin dim r 1 w f r 1 thus to complete the proof it is enough to show that w g r 2 w f r 1 in fact up to isomorphism in derived categories we may assume that f r 1 c b r 2 proj and g r 2 c b r 1 proj without loss of generality we suppose that f r 1 is a complex in c b r 2 proj of the form 0 p r d r p r 1 p 1 p 0 0 such that r w f r 1 0 this implies that h 0 f r 1 6 0 and d r is not a split injection since f g is an adjoint pair we always have homk r 2 f r 1 r 2 n homd r 2 f r 1 r 2 n homd r 1 r 1 g r 2 n h n g r 2 for all n z it follows that h i g r 2 0 for i 0 or i r further we claim that h r g r 2 6 0 and therefore sup g r 2 r actually since d r is not a split injection we have homk r 2 f r 1 p r r 6 0 thus 0 6 homk r 2 f r 1 r 2 r h r g r 2 so up to isomorphism in k r 1 the complex g r 2 has the following form 0 qs s qs 1 qs 2 qr 1 qr 0 c b r 1 proj such that 0 r s w g r 2 in particular this implies that s is not a split injection so to show w f r 1 w g r 2 we only need to show s 0 indeed since g f is an adjoint pair we have homk r 1 g r 2 r 1 n homd r 1 g r 2 r 1 n homd r 2 r 2 f r 1 n h n f r 1 for all n z on the one hand if s 0 then homk r 1 g r 2 r 1 s h s f r 1 0 and therefore homk r 1 g r 2 q s s 0 this means that s is a split injection a contradiction on the other hand if s 0 then 0 homk r 1 g r 2 r 1 h 0 f r 1 this is also a contradiction thus s 0 and w f r 1 w g r 2 as desired the above result describes a relationship for finitistic dimensions of derived equivalent rings if we weaken derived equivalences into half recollements of perfect derived module categories we will obtain the following general result which provides a bound for the finitistic dimension of the middle ring by those of the other two rings 14 proposition 3 10 suppose that there is a half recollement of perfect derived module categories of the rings r 1 r 2 and r 3 d c r 1 i d c r 2 j i ww d c r 3 j ww then fin dim r 2 fin dim r 1 fin dim r 3 w i r 1 w j r 3 1 in particular if fin dim r 1 and fin dim r 3 then fin dim r 2 proof the proof will be done in several steps we may suppose that fin dim r 1 and fin dim r 3 clearly if one of r 1 and r 3 is zero then proposition 3 10 follows from corollary 3 9 from now on we assume that r 1 6 0 6 r 3 step 1 we claim that j j p r 2 d c u r 2 where u fin dim r 3 w j r 3 0 actually since j d c r 3 d c r 2 is fully faithful we have 0 6 j r 3 d c r 2 this implies sup j r 3 as j j is an adjoint pair one can follow the proof of lemma 3 3 1 to show that sup j r 3 inf j note that inf j fin dim j thus sup j r 3 fin dim j define u 1 sup j r 3 fin dim r 3 then u 1 fin dim j fin dim r 3 it follows from lemma 3 4 1 that j p r 2 d c u 1 r 3 in other words for any y p r 2 there exists a complex p y p n y n z c b r 3 proj with p n y 0 for n u 1 such that j y p y in d c r 3 clearly the complex p y is of the following form 0 pu 1 y p u 1 1 y p u 1 2 y p s y y 0 where s y depends on y and u 1 s y since j r 3 d c r 2 by the half recollement we see that j r 3 is isomorphic in dc r 2 to a bounded complex l of the form 0 lu 2 lu 2 1 lu 2 2 0 such that u 2 sup j r 3 w j r 3 and that li r 2 proj for all i u 2 see section 3 1 this implies j r 3 d c u 2 r 2 since d c u 2 r 2 is closed under direct summands in d c r 2 by lemma 3 2 1 we have j r 3 proj d c u 2 r 2 note that u fin dim r 3 w j r 3 fin dim r 3 sup j r 3 u 2 u 1 u 2 now we claim that j j p r 2 d c u r 2 d c u 1 u 2 r 2 actually for the complex p y c b r 3 proj there is a canonical distinguished triangle in d c r 3 p s y y s y p y p y s y 1 p s y y 1 s y where p y s y 1 is truncated from p y by replacing p s y y with 0 that is p y u 1 1 0 pu 1 y p u 1 1 y p s y 1 y 0 0 this induces a distinguished triangle in dc r 2 j p s y y s y j p y j p y s y 1 j p s y y 1 s y note that j p s y y s y dc s y u 2 r 2 d c u 1 u 2 r 2 due to u 1 s y since p i y r 3 proj for all u 1 i s y one can apply lemma 3 2 2 to show that j p y d c u 1 u 2 r 2 by induction on the number of non zero terms of a complex it follows from j y p y that j j y j p y d c u 1 u 2 r 2 this implies that j j p r 2 d c u 1 u 2 r 2 15 step 2 we show that i i p r 2 d c v r 2 where v fin dim r 1 w i r 1 u 1 first of all we claim that there is an integer m such that m fin dim i indeed the given half recollement yields the following canonical triangle j j y y y y i i y j j y 1 in d r 2 where y and y stand for the counit and unit adjunction morphisms respectively since j j y d c u r 2 d c r 2 we can find a complex u un n z c b r 2 proj with u n 0 for all n u 0 such that j j y u in d r 2 it follows that homd r 2 j j y y homd r 2 u y homk r 2 u y so there exists a chain map f u y such that its mapping cone v is isomorphic to i i y in d r 2 clearly v 0 u 1 y and v j u j 1 for any j 6 0 in particular v j 0 for all j u 1 since i d c r 1 d c r 2 is fully faithful we have hn i y homd r 1 r 1 i y n homd r 2 i r 1 i i y n homd r 2 i r 1 v n by assumption i r 1 d c r 2 and therefore is isomorphic in d c r 2 to a complex q 0 qv 2 qv 2 1 qb 0 in c b r 2 proj where b sup i r 1 and b v 2 w i r 1 see section 3 1 let m u 1 b then hn i y homd r 2 i r 1 v n homd r 2 q v n homk r 2 q v n 0 for all n m this implies that m fin dim i as claimed let v 1 m fin dim r 1 it follows from lemma 3 4 1 that i p r 2 d c v 1 r 1 now replacing the pair j j in the proof of step 1 with i i one can similarly show that i i p r 2 d c v 1 v 2 r 2 note that v 1 v 2 fin dim r 1 w i r 1 u 1 v u 1 1 step 3 we show that fin dim r 2 v fin dim r 1 fin dim r 3 w i r 1 w j r 3 1 since j j y dc u r 2 and i i y dc v r 2 for y p r 2 with u v it follows from the triangle and lemma 3 2 2 that y dc v r 2 now let p pn dn n z c b r 2 proj such that pn 0 for all n v and that y p in dc r 2 since y is an r 2 module we see that h n p 0 for n 6 0 and h 0 p y consequently ker d 0 r 2 proj and the following complex 0 p v d v p v 1 d v 1 p 1 d 1 ker d 0 y 0 is exact thus proj dim r 2 y v and therefore fin dim r 2 v now with the above preparations we prove the following strong version of theorem 1 1 theorem 3 11 let r 1 r 2 and r 3 be rings suppose that there exists a recollement among the derived module categories d r 3 d r 2 and d r 1 of r 3 r 2 and r 1 d r 1 i d r 2 j i ff i xx d r 3 j ff j xx then the following statements hold true 1 suppose that j restricts to a functor d b r 3 d b r 2 of bounded derived module categories then fin dim r 3 fin dim r 2 cw j homz r 2 q z 2 suppose that i r 1 is a compact object in d r 2 then a fin dim r 1 fin dim r 2 w i r 2 b fin dim r 2 fin dim r 1 fin dim r 3 w i r 1 w j r 3 1 16 proof note that the triangle functors j and i in a recollement always take compact objects to compact objects and that i r 1 is compact if and only if j r 2 is compact for a reference of this fact one may see for example 9 lemma 2 2 thus we have a sequence of functors d c r 1 d c r 2 i oo d c r 3 j oo where the functor j is fully faithful applying corollary 3 6 2 to the adjoint pair j j we then obtain 1 suppose i r 1 d c r 2 then j r 2 d c r 3 and the given recollement in theorem 3 11 induces a half recollment of prefect derived module categories d c r 1 i d c r 2 j i ww d c r 3 j ww now the statements a and b in 2 follow from corollary 3 6 1 and proposition 3 10 respectively this completes the proof of theorem 3 11 as a consequence of theorem 3 11 we obtain the following corollary which extends the main result 25 theorem on finitistic dimensions of artin algebras to the one of arbitrary rings corollary 3 12 let r be a ring and e an idempotent element of r suppose that the canonical surjection r r rer is homological with rrer p r then fin dim r rer fin dim r fin dim ere fin dim r rer proj dim rr rer 1 proof let j rer since the canonical surjection r r j is homological there exists a recollement of derived module categories d r j d d r er lr ee r j lr d ere re lere ee since rj p r we see that d r j r j dc r and that w r j proj dim rr j moreover re lere ere re and w rre 0 now corollary 3 12 follows from theorem 3 11 2 b and corollary 3 8 since a recollement at db level induces a recollement at d level the following result is a straightforward consequence of theorem 3 11 which also generalizes 16 theorem 2 corollary 3 13 let r 1 r 2 and r 3 be rings suppose that there exists a recollement among the derived module categories db r 3 d b r 2 and d b r 1 d b r 1 i d b r 2 j i gg i vv d b r 3 j gg j vv such that i r 1 d c r 2 then fin dim r 2 if and only if max fin dim r 1 fin dim r 3 the existence of a recollement at db level occurs in the following special case see 21 18 let r be a ring and j rer be an ideal generated by an idempotent element e in r such that rj is projective and finitely generated and that jr has finite projective dimension then there exists a recollement among 17 d b r j db r and db ere remark that without proj dim jr we may not get a recollement at db level because the left derived functor re lere d ere d r may not restrict to a functor of bounded derived categories one can construct a desired counterexample from triangular matrix rings applying corollary 3 12 to triangular matrix rings we re obtain the following well known result for example see 14 corollary 4 21 corollary 3 14 let r and s be rings and let m be an s t bimodule set b s m 0 t then fin dim s fin dim b fin dim s fin dim t 1 proof let e 0 0 0 1 then beb be ebe t b beb s b 1 e and bb bs be thus bbeb b proj and the canonical surjection b s is homological now corollary 3 14 follows from corol lary 3 12 recall from 10 that a morphism y x of objects in an additive category c is said to be co variant if the induced map homc x homc x y homc x x is injective and the induced map homc y homc y y homc y x is a split epimorphism of endc y modules covariant morphisms capture traces of modules which guarantee the ubiquity of covariant morphisms see 10 for covariant morphisms we have the following result which follows from corollary 3 12 and 10 lemma 3 2 corollary 3 15 let f y x be a covariant morphism in an additive category c then fin dim endc y x fin dim endc y x fin dim endc y fin dim endc y x 2 where endc y x is the quotient ring of the endomorphism ring endc x of x modulo the ideal generated by all those endomorphisms of x which factorize through the object y consequently we have the following result which restates corollary 1 6 corollary 3 16 1 let i be an idempotent ideal in a ring r then fin dim r i fin dim endr r i fin dim endr ri fin dim r i 2 in particular if ri is projective and finitely generated then fin dim r i fin dim r fin dim endr ri fin dim r i 2 2 let 0 z y f x 0 be an almost split sequence in r mod with r an artin algebra such that homr y z 0 see 3 for definition then fin dim endr y x fin dim endr y 2 proof 1 since the inclusion i r is a covariant homomorphism in r mod and endr i r r i we know that the first statement in 1 follows from corollary 3 15 immediately the last statement is a consequence of the fact that r is morita equivalent to endr r i 2 under the assumption we know that f is a covariant map in r mod the category of finitely generated r modules so by corollary 3 15 it is sufficient to show that fin dim endr y x 0 in fact since endr x is a local algebra and since the ideal of endr x generated by all homomorphisms which factorize through y belong to the radical of endr x the algebra endr y x is local note that a local artin algebra has finitistic dimension 0 therefore fin dim endr y x 0 now 2 follows from corollary 3 15 note that an alternative proof of corollary 1 6 2 can be given by 17 theorem 1 1 together with corol lary 3 14 and 22 18 in the following we point out that the methods developed in this paper for little finitistic dimensions also work for big finitistic and global dimensions recall that for an arbitrary ring r we denote by fin dim r and gl dim r the big finitistic and global dimensions of r respectively by definition gl dim r respec tively fin dim r is the supremum of projective dimensions of all left r modules respectively which have finite projective dimension clearly fin dim r fin dim r gl dim r and if gl dim r then fin dim r gl dim r however the equality fin dim r fin dim r does not have to hold in general see 26 as in theorem 3 11 we have the following result on big finitistic dimensions of rings in which the condition 2 is weaker than the one in theorem 3 11 2 theorem 3 17 let r 1 r 2 and r 3 be rings suppose that there exists a recollement among the derived module categories d r 3 d r 2 and d r 1 of r 3 r 2 and r 1 d r 1 i d r 2 j i ff i xx d r 3 j ff j xx then the following statements hold true 1 suppose that j restricts to a functor d b r 3 d b r 2 of bounded derived module categories then fin dim r 3 fin dim r 2 cw j homz r 2 q z 2 suppose that i r 1 is isomorphic in d r 2 to a bounded complex of not necessarily finitely gener ated projective r 2 modules then we have the following a fin dim r 1 fin dim r 2 w i r 2 b fin dim r 2 fin dim r 1 fin dim r 3 w i r 1 w j r 3 1 sketch of the proof let us consider the full subcategory x r of d r consisting of all those com plexes which are isomorphic in d r to bounded complexes of projective r modules it is known that x r contains dc r and that the localization functor k r d r induces a triangle equivalence k b r proj x r similarly one can define big finitistic dimensions of functors and establish several parallel results for fin dim r such as lemma 3 5 corollary 3 6 and proposition 3 10 in the present situation we shall replace dc r with x r and consider big finitistic dimensions of triangle functors which commute with direct sums further to show theorem 3 17 we observe the following facts for a given recollement i the functors j j i and i commute with direct sums ii the functors j and i preserve compact objects and restrict to triangle functors x r 3 j x r 2 and x r 2 i x r 1 iii if i r 1 x r 2 then i and j restrict to triangle functors x r 1 i x r 2 and x r 2 j x r 3 now one can use the methods in the proof of theorem 3 11 to show theorem 3 17 here we omit the details concerning global dimensions we can describe explicitly upper bounds for the global dimension of a ring in terms of the ones of the other two rings involved in a recollement these upper bounds imply the finiteness of global dimensions mentioned in 2 proposition 2 14 theorem 3 18 let r 1 r 2 and r 3 be rings suppose that there exists a recollement among the derived module categories d r 3 d r 2 and d r 1 of r 3 r 2 and r 1 19 d r 1 i d r 2 j i ff i xx d r 3 j ff j xx then we have the following 1 if gl dim r 2 then gl dim r 3 gl dim r 2 cw j homz r 2 q z and gl dim r 1 gl dim r 2 w i r 2 2 if gl dim r 1 and gl dim r 3 then gl dim r 2 gl dim r 1 gl dim r 3 w i r 1 w j r 3 1 sketch of the proof from 2 proposition 2 14 and its proof we observe the following two facts i if gl dim r 2 or gl dim r 3 then i r 1 is isomorphic in d r 2 to a bounded complex of projective r 2 modules ii gl dim r 2 if and only if both gl dim r 1 and gl dim r 3 in this case the recollement among unbounded derived categories can restrict to a recollement of bounded derived categories moreover for a ring r if gl dim r then gl dim r fin dim r now theorem 3 18 becomes a consequence of theorem 3 17 3 3 proofs of theorem 1 2 and corollary 1 3 now let us turn to proofs of our results on exact contexts that arise from different situations proof of theorem 1 2 given an exact context m m we have defined its noncommutative tensor product t r s and the following two ring homomorphisms s t r s s 7 1 s for s s and t t r s t 7 t 1 for t t note that t r s has t r s as its abelian groups while its multiplication is different from the usual tensor product see 8 for details let b s m 0 t c m 2 t r s and 0 b c where m t r s is the unique r r bimodule homomorphism such that m and m let s 0 m t s 0 7 sm 0 for s s then is a homomorphism of b r bimodules denote by p the mapping cone of then p c b b zrop and bp c b b proj in particular p dc b by 8 theorem 1 1 if torri t s 0 for all i 1 then there is a recollement of derived categories d c d d b j ff c lb xx d r ff j xx where j bp lr j hom b p and d is the restriction functor induced from the ring homo morphism b c first of all we have two easy observations i since c m 2 t r s is morita equivalent to t r s we have fin dim c fin dim t r s 20 ii since b is a triangular matrix ring with the rings s and t in the diagonal it follows from corollary 3 14 that fin dim b fin dim s fin dim t 1 we first apply corollary 3 7 to show theorem 1 2 1 in fact by 8 lemma 5 4 we see that r endd b p as rings via multiplication and that homd b p p n 0 for any n 6 0 it remains to show that p r is isomorphic in d r op to a bounded complex of flat rop modules since the sequence 0 r s t m m m 0 is exact we have con m con in d rop this implies that p r t con m t con in d r op where con is the complex 0 r t 0 with t in degree 0 if flat dim tr then theorem 1 2 1 is trivially true so we may suppose flat dim tr let t max 1 flat dim tr then p is isomorphic in d rop to a bounded complex f 0 f t f t 1 f 1 f 0 0 such that f i are flat rop modules for t i 0 it follows from corollary 3 7 that fin dim r fin dim b t fin dim s fin dim t t 1 this shows theorem 1 2 1 next we shall apply theorem 3 11 to the above recollement and give a proof of theorem 1 2 2 by the proof of 9 theorem 1 3 2 we see that d c bc p b if and only if rs p r suppose rs p r it follows from 8 corollary 5 8 1 that proj dim bc max 2 proj dim rs 1 since c lb b c in d c we see from theorem 3 11 2 a that fin dim c fin dim b note that fin dim t r s fin dim c and fin dim b fin dim s fin dim t 1 thus a holds since d c bc and j r bp in d b we know that w p 1 and w d c w bc proj dim bc max 2 proj dim rs 1 now it follows from theorem 3 11 2 b that fin dim b fin dim r fin dim t r s max 2 proj dim rs 1 1 1 clearly fin dim s fin dim b thus b holds let us point out the following fact related to theorem 1 2 2 suppose that m m is an exact content with torri t s 0 for all i 1 if r s is a homological ring epimorphism such that rs p r then fin dim s fin dim r and fin dim t r s fin dim t in fact in this case the tor vanishing condition that is torri t s 0 for all i 0 is equivalent to that t t r s is a homological ring epimorphism see 8 theorem 1 1 1 for details moreover we have t r s t r s as t s bimodules it follows that if rs p r then t t r s p t by the tor vanishing condition therefore the above mentioned fact is a consequence of corollary 3 8 proof of corollary 1 3 let s r be the inclusion of from s into r and let r r s be the canonical surjection we define s r ends r s s 7 r 7 rs for s s and r r s to be the right multiplication map then the quadruple homs r r s determined by the extension is an exact context see the examples in 8 section 3 and its noncommutative tensor product r s r is defined if sr is flat then tor s i r r 0 for all i 1 particularly under the assumption on sr in corollary 1 3 2 the quadruple fulfills the tor vanishing condition in theorem 1 2 2 now we apply theorem 1 2 to the exact context homs r r s and see that the statements a and b in corollary 1 3 follow from the statements a and b in theorem 1 2 respectively to show corollary 1 3 1 we shall apply theorem 1 2 1 for this aim we shall prove flat dim r s max flat dim homs r r s s flat dim r s s 21 however this can be concluded from the following exact sequence of right r modules also right s modules 0 r homs r r s homs s r s 0 which is obtained by applying homs r s to the exact sequence 0 s r r s 0 now the statement 1 follows from theorem 1 2 1 3 4 proofs of corollaries 1 4 and 1 5 in the following we shall show that under the assumptions in corollaries 1 4 and 1 5 we can get exact pairs a special class of exact contents which satisfy the tor vanishing condition in theorem 1 2 and then apply theorem 1 2 to each case here noncommutative tensor products will be replaced by coproducts and the latter will be interpreted further as some usual constructions of rings let r s and r t be ring homomorphisms and let m be an s t bimodule with m m recall that an exact context m m is called an exact pair if m s r t and m 1 1 in this case we simply say that is an exact pair by 8 corollary 4 3 if the map in the exact context is a ring epimorphism then the pair is exact moreover by 8 remark 5 2 for an exact pair we have t r s s r t the coproduct of the r rings of s and t proof of corollary 1 4 we define t r m r t to be the inclusion from r into t and r m s m to be the canonical map induced from by lemma 2 2 the ring s m together with the inclusion s s m and t s m is the coproduct of s and t over r now we show that is an exact pair actually the split exact sequence 0 r t m 0 of r r bimodules implies that rtr r m as r r bimodules since is a ring epimorphism and m is an s s bimodule the map s r t s m s r m 7 sr sm for s s and m m is an isomorphism of s t bimodules under this isomorphism we can identify the map ids s s t with the inclusion s s m and the map idt t s r t with note that 0 s s m m 0 is also a split exact sequence of s s bimodules it follows that cok cok m as r r bimodules and therefore the sequence of r r bimodules 0 r s t s m 0 is exact this means that the pair is exact consequently we know that t r s s r t s m as rings note that tor r i t s tor r i r m s torri m s 0 for all i 1 thus corollary 1 4 a follows immediately from theorem 1 2 2 a now we turn to the proof of corollary 1 4 b note that if we apply theorem 1 2 2 b to the exact pair then we only get fin dim s fin dim r fin dim s m max 1 proj dim rs 3 so to obtain the better upper bound given in corollary 1 4 b we need the following statement let f and g be ring homomorphisms such that f g id if fin dim l s then fin dim fin dim s to show we set f l d d if fin dim f then is automatically true so we suppose that fin dim f s is an integer and 6 0 since f 6 0 we have s 0 let x p then there exists a finite projective resolution 0 pn p 1 p 0 x 0 of x with all pi in proj now we define y s x the s th syzygy module of x thus y p since fin dim f s we see that tor j y tor j s x h s j f x 0 for all j 0 it follows that y p and i y i y qi for all i 0 where all qi are finitely generated projective modules further we may suppose that fin dim t then proj dim y t and 22 therefore t y t y qt proj since f g id we have t y t y proj consequently proj dim x proj dim y s proj dim t y t s t s thus fin dim fin dim s this finishes the proof of now we take s and s m let f s s m and g s m s be the canonical injection and surjection respectively clearly we have f g ids we assume s 6 0 then l 6 0 and fin dim l 0 suppose fin dim r m due to in order to show corollary 1 4 b we only need to prove that fin dim ls m this is equivalent to saying that tor s n x tor s n m x 0 for all x p s and for all n m to check the latter we first prove that torsj m n tor r j m n for any s module n and for all j 1 indeed let p be a deleted projective resolution of the rop module m since torri m s 0 for all i 1 we see that p r s is a deleted projective resolution of the s op module m r s note that m r s m as sop modules since r s is a ring epimorphism and m is an sop module it follows that p r s is a deleted projective resolution of the sop module m since p r s s n p r n as complexes we have torsj m n tor r j m n for all j 1 let sx p s since proj dim rs the change of rings theorem implies that proj dim rx proj dim sx proj dim rs hence proj dim rx m fin dim r and torsn m x tor r n m x 0 if n m this implies that fin dim ls m now by the result we obtain fin dim s fin dim m fin dim s m fin dim r this completes the proof of corollary 1 4 b we remark that the statement also implies that for any trivial extension of r by an r r bimodule m we always have fin dim r fin dim r m flat dim mr proof of corollary 1 5 let r s r i 1 and r t r i 2 be the canonical surjective ring homomorphisms since i 1 i 2 0 we see that r i 1 i 2 1 is an exact context where 1 is the identity of the ring r i 1 i 2 even more since r is a pullback of the surjective maps r r ii over r i 1 i 2 the pair is exact for example see 8 section 3 so t r s s r t as rings note that s r t r i 1 r r i 2 r i 1 i 2 by lemma 2 3 2 thus t r s r i 1 i 2 as rings now we apply theorem 1 2 to show corollary 1 5 clearly it remains to check that if torri i 2 i 1 0 for i 0 then torri r i 2 r i 1 0 for all i 0 in fact for i 2 we have tor r i r i 2 r i 1 tor r i 2 i 2 i 1 0 by assumption note that torr 1 r i 2 r i 1 i 2 i 1 i 2 i 1 0 and tor r 2 r i 2 r i 1 tor r 1 i 2 r i 1 ker f where f i 2 r i 1 i 2 i 1 is the multiplication map since i 2 r i 1 0 we have tor r 2 r i 2 r i 1 ker f 0 thus torri r i 2 r i 1 0 for all i 0 finally we apply our results to exact contexts related to homological ring epimorphisms first of all we establish a method to construct new homological ring epimorphisms from given ones lemma 3 19 let r s be a homological ring epimorphism suppose that i is an ideal of r such that the image j of i under is a left ideal in s and that the restriction of to i is injective let j be the ideal of s generated by j then the following statements are equivalent 1 the homomorphism r i s j induced from is homological 2 tor r i i j j s j 0 for all i 1 3 the multiplication map i r s j is an isomorphism and tor r j i s 0 for all j 1 4 torrj r i s 0 for all j 1 let b s s j 0 r i if one of the above statements holds true then there is a recollement of derived module categories d s j d b gg ww d r ff xx 23 proof we take t r i and choose r t to be the canonical surjective homomorphism of rings since j is a left ideal of s we have s r t s r r i s s i s j on the one hand the pair is exact if and only if i i j is an isomorphism on the other hand by lemma 2 3 2 we see that s r t s r i s j with j j s and that the ring homomorphism t s r t in 8 theorem 1 1 can be chosen as the canonical map r i s j induced from thus 1 and 4 are equivalent by 8 theorem 1 1 1 moreover the recollement follows from 8 theorem 1 1 2 in the following we shall show that 3 and 4 are equivalent applying the tensor functor r s to the exact sequence 0 i r r i 0 we obtain torr 1 r i s ker and tor r j 1 r i s tor r j i s for all j 1 where i r s j is the multiplication map defined by x s 7 x s for x i and s s clearly this implies that 4 is equivalent to 3 now we show that 1 and 2 are equivalent according to lemma 2 3 1 and the fact that is a ring epimorphism it follows that is a ring epimor phism by assumption j is a left ideal of s and therefore s r r i s s i s j thanks to the general result proved in the last part of the proof of 8 lemma 5 6 we see tor r i i s j w tor r i i s r r i w 0 for all i 1 and all s j modules w it then follows that tor r i i s j s j 0 for all i 1 consider the short exact sequence of right r i modules 0 j j s j s j 0 if we apply the functor r i s j to this sequence then tor r i i j j s j tor r i i 1 s j s j for all i 1 and the connecting homomorphism tor r i 1 s j s j j j r i s j is injective clearly if tor r i 1 s j s j 0 then tor r i j s j s j 0 for all j 1 if and only if tor r i i j j s j 0 for all i 1 this will imply that 1 and 2 are equivalent so it is enough to demonstrate that tor r i 1 s j s j 0 always holds under the assumptions of corollary 3 19 however this is true if we can show j j r i s j 0 in fact if c d is a ring epimorphism then d c x x as d modules for any d module x and y c d y as right d modules for any right d module y this fact together with properties of ring epimorphisms implies the following isomorphisms j j r i s j j j r s j j j r s r s j j j r s r s j since sj j and jj j we deduce j j r s j 0 this means that j j r s is a right s j module clearly the composite of the two ring epimorphisms r s and s s j is again a ring epimorphism it follows that j j r s r s j j j r s as right s j modules in the following we shall show j j r s 0 actually applying the functor r s to the exact sequence 0 j j j j 0 of right r modules we get an exact sequence j r s rs j r s j j r s 0 of right s modules since j is a right s module and r s is a ring epimorphism the multiplication map j r s j defined by x s 7 xs for x j and s s is an isomorphism note that the map r s j r s j is surjective this yields that r s is surjective and j j r s 0 hence tor r i 1 s j s j 0 this finishes the proof 24 a special case of lemma 3 19 appears in trivial extensions let r s be a homomorphism of rings and m be an s s bimodule then is homological if and only if r m s m is homological the necessity of this condition follows from 8 theorem 1 1 1 and the proof of corollary 1 4 the sufficiency can be seen from lemma 3 19 applying theorem 1 2 to the exact pair in the proof of lemma 3 19 we obtain the following estimations on finitistic dimensions which can be applied to a class of examples of milnor squares corollary 3 20 let r s be a homological ring epimorphism suppose that i is an ideal of r such that the image j of i under is a left ideal in s and that the restriction of to i is injective let j be the ideal of s generated by j suppose that one of the conditions 1 4 in lemma 3 19 holds then 1 fin dim r fin dim s fin dim r i max 1 flat dim r i r 1 2 if rs p r then a fin dim s fin dim r and fin dim s j fin dim r i b fin dim b fin dim r fin dim s j max 1 proj dim rs 3 where b s s j 0 r i acknowledgement the both authors would like to express heartfelt gratitude to steffen
