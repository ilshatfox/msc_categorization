multiplicities of eigenvalues of generalized rotation operators in terms of generalized frobenius schur indicators in a semisimple spherical tensor category c in particular this implies that the entire collection of rotation eigenvalues for a fusion category can be computed from the fusion rules and the traces of rotation at finitely many tensor powers we also establish a rigidity property for fs indicators of fusion categories with a given fusion ring via jones s theory of planar algebras if c is also braided these formulae yield the multiplicities of eigenvalues for a large class of braids in the associated braid group representations when c is modular this allows one to determine the eigenvalues and multiplicities of braids in terms of just the s and t matrices 1 introduction our understanding of symmetry in a diverse range of topology representation theory and mathematical physics relies on first understanding rotations obvious examples appear in the study of winding numbers and knot polynomials the actions of rotation operators played an important role in the construction and obstruction theory of vaughan jones s planar algebras jon 98 which provide a diagrammatic axiomatization of the representation theory of murray von neumann subfactors in particular the small index subfactor classification program has been advanced significantly by understanding rotation eigenvalues in relation to other data for an overview see jon 01 jms 13 from a purely algebraic standpoint rotation can be realized as a tensor flip map v 1 v 2 vn 7 vn v 1 v 2 vn 1 kashina sommerha user and zhu ksz 06 showed that the traces of rotation operators on tensor powers of a given representation of a semisimple hopf algebra yield the higher frobenius schur fs indicators for the representation the definition of these in the hopf algebra settings generalizes the classical frobenius schur indicators defined for complex rep resentations of finite groups see lm 00 ng and schauenberg used a synthesis of the subfactor and hopf algebra approaches to generalize much of this theory to the setting of spherical fusion categories ns 07 b ns 07 a the advantages of

daniel barter corey jones and henry tucker the categorical fs indicators have proven to be a powerful invariant of fusion categories as well as their braided counterparts they provide the main technical ingredient in the recent proofs showing the representation of the modular group sl 2 z coming from the drinfel d center of a spherical fusion category that is the canonically associated braided fusion cate gory has a congruence subgroup as its kernel sz 12 ns 10 and showing rank finiteness for modular categories bnrw 16 crucially ng and schauenburg provide a method for comput ing fs indicators of a spherical fusion category in terms of the modular data of its drinfel d center ns 07 a the preceding is discussed in greater detail in section 2 we have seen that there is a great deal of theory regarding the traces of rotation operators and how to compute them from basic categorical data however their actual eigenvalues and corresponding multiplicities have been relatively inaccessible except in special cases in this note we will give formulae for the multiplicities of the eigenvalues of generalized rotation operators in terms of the generalized fs indicators and we will present two applications in section 3 we establish the eigenvalue multiplicities using galois actions on cyclotomic fields and properties of generalized fs indicators to derive the traces of the powers of rotations the finite fourier transform yields the desired formulae in theorem 3 4 however it is desirable to be able to compute the rotation eigenvalues from as little information as possible since there are many situations where the full modular data for the center is not easily accessible for example in gm 16 gannon and morrison describe a procedure for computing possible modular data for the drinfel d centers z c of categorifications c of a given fusion ring their algorithm effectively produces finitely many possibilities for the forgetful functor z c c and the t matrix of z c but finding the s matrix requires solving a generally large system of quadratics which may or may not be possible in theorem 3 7 we show how to compute the generalized frobenius schur indicators from just the t matrix and the forgetful functor hence our formulae let us determine the set of rotation eigenvalues for a given categorification from this information alone the fs indicator data has been an important invariant for classifying categorifications c of a given fusion ring r this is a fusion category whose tensor product structure is isomorphic to r on the level of rings at the end of section 3 we establish a rigidity property for the fs indicators of categorifications of a given fusion ring rigidity phenomenon describe situations where one gets more for less some a priori weaker invariants being equal implies some stronger invariants are equal fs indicators are invariants of spherical fusion categories we say that a fusion ring has fs indicator rigidity if each of its categorifications has a unique sequence of fs indicators if c is a fusion category the sequence is periodic so this is a finite set of data for example the tambara yamagami fusion rings have fs indicator rigidity bj 15 richard ng has asked whether singly generated fusion rings have fs indicator rigidity we observe a negative answer to this question the quadratic haagerup fusion ring with g z 3 admits two inequivalent unitary hence spherical categorifications with the same fs indicator data however we are able to show a weaker rigidity property if two categorifications of a given singly generated fusion ring have the same higher frobenius schur indicator data then their associated planar algebras are isomorphic as objects in the representation category of jones s annular temperley lieb algebroid jon 01 as we shall see this category is related closely to the drinfel d center of the category of representations of the drinfel d jimbo quantum group for sl 2 we establish this property of fusion rings in theorem 3 15 and name it annular fs indicator rigidity a planar algebra is a commutative algebra object in the annular eigenvalues of rotations and braids in spherical fusion categories 3 representation category given an object v c one can construct a planar algebra p v if v v tensor generates c one can recover the category c from the planar algebra suppose r is a fusion ring and c and d are spherical categorifications of r suppose v c and w d are identified under the equivalence of fusion rings then the annular fs rigidity property is stated as follows if the fs indicator data for c and d are the same then p v pw as objects but not necessarily as commutative algebras one can only recover the category c from p v as an algebra object hence the failure of full fs indicator rigidity can be expressed as non uniqueness of the commutative algebra structure on a given object in the annular representation category this also suggests a possible approach to determining which classes of fusion rings exhibit the stronger property of full fs indicator rigidity for example it is possible that from general considerations one could determine that certain objects in the annular representation category admit at most one commutative algebra structure which would imply fs indicator rigidity for any underlying fusion ring finally in section 4 we use our formulae to compute eigenvalues of braid group represen tations associated to braided spherical ribbon fusion categories in terms of generalized fs indicator data in particular when the braiding is non degenerate i e the category is modular our formulae can be written in terms of the modular data i e the s and t matrices from the braiding and spherical structures given an object v in a ribbon fusion category c we have representations of the braid groups bn n v bn endc v n using our formulae in proposition 3 4 and proposition 3 7 we can compute the eigenvalues under these representations for a large class of braids called the jucys murphy elements of the braid group bn m l this class of braids includes the braid group generators and the periodic braids as demonstrated in tw 01 rt 10 the eigenvalues of the braid generator may contain a large amount of information about the associated representation in low dimensions indeed small representations of b 3 are essentially determined by the spectrum of the braid group generator tw 01 in many cases related to quantum groups the spectrum for the braiding can be worked out using explicit forms of the braid matrix but until now there has been no general procedure for finding which square roots occur and with what multiplicity we also anticipate the utility of our formulae for understanding drinfel d centers of exotic fusion categories which don t appear to come from quantum groups in an obvious way see hrw 08 4 daniel barter corey jones and henry tucker remark our results only require c to be a spherical semisimple tensor category that is with possibly infinitely many isomorphism classes of simple objects we primarily restrict our attention to fusion categories finitely many simple objects since in this case the sequence of higher fs indicators is periodic but we have been careful to prove our results in a way that generalizes easily to the non fusion case acknowledgments the authors wish to thank vaughan jones for the

in this note tensor categorymeans a locally finite k linear abelian monoidal category c 1 where the monoidal structure is bilinear on morphisms and the unit object has endc 1 k the local finiteness condition requires objects to have finite length and morphism spaces to be finite dimensional refer to egno 15 for these definitions and other background on the theory of tensor categories we assume for convenience that our tensor categories are strict which can be done without loss of generality by mac lane s strictness theorem with this assumption we may take advantage of graphical calculus for morphisms remark our graphical calculus convention is that diagrams are read bottom to top the opposite convention to ns 07 b ns 10 but the same as mu g 03 a mu g 03 b definition 2 1 a fusion category is a finite tensor category c 1 that is also semi simple with set of simple objects irr c such that 1 irr c and rigid i e objects x c have right left duals x c note the finiteness condition implies that irr c the first important invariant of fusion categories is the fusion ring which is the same as the grothendieck ring k 0 c this is the z based ring with basis given by the set irr c of isomorphism classes of simple objects in c addition by the direct sum and multiplication by the direct product if a b c irr c then the structure coefficients are the integers n ca b dimhomc a b c in general we use the notation n ba 1 an dimhomc a 1 an b these larger multiplicities can be computed from the fusion rule in the following way nda b c e irr c nda en e b c we also use the notation an a a so that for example nda a a nda 3 these numbers depend on the objects only up to isomorphism given a fusion ring r we call a fusion category c a categorification of r if k 0 c r eigenvalues of rotations and braids in spherical fusion categories 5 2 2 pivotal structures in this article we consider spherical fusion categories these come with a well defined trace on endomorphisms of objects a pivotal structure on a rigid tensor category is a choice of natural monoidal isomorphism from the double dual endofunctor to the identity endofunctor it was shown in ns 07 a that we can always choose our pivotal structure to be strictly pivotal in the sense that we can pick our duality functor so that the natural isomorphism from the double dual functor to the identity functor is the identity such a choice will be more conducive to graphical methods see the following discussion recall that by rigidity for each object a c we have a left dual object a c with morphisms coeva homc 1 a a and eva homc a a 1 represented by cups and caps respectively these satisfy the duality or zig zag equations see for example mu g 03 a for duality in graphical calculus similarly a c has a left dual a with morphisms coeva homc 1 a a and eva homc a a 1 using the pivotal structure these morphisms make a also a right dual of a they are basis elements for the transpose spaces of the left dual morphism spaces coeva homc 1 a a and eva homc a a 1 now these four morphisms are represented graphically as oriented caps and cups the left and right duality can be extended to a monoidal equivalence of categories between c and cop for f homc a b we have the left transpose f l homc b a which is given by f l evb 1 a 1 b f 1 a 1 b coeva in diagrams this is left rotation of f by likewise we define the right transpose f r homc b a via right rotation by as follows f r 1 a evb 1 a f 1 b coeva 1 b the pivotal structure gives a monoidal natural isomorphism between left and right duali ties and the strictness of the pivotal structures means f l f r hence we can unambiguously define f f l f r using this fact it is easy to check that the duality functor f satisfies f f strictness of the pivotal structure is then represented graphically as a b f a b f in a pivotal fusion category one may define the left and right pivotal or quantum traces of an endomorphism f homc a a of an object a c trl f eva 1 a f coeva and trr f eva f 1 a coeva 6 daniel barter corey jones and henry tucker definition 2 2 a pivotal fusion category is called spherical if the left and right quantum traces agree for all objects a c and morphisms f homc a a this condition is depicted as the following equality of diagrams a f a f we are also now able to define the quantum dimension da of an object a c by letting da tr 1 a the trace of the identity morphism 1 a homc a a then the global dimension dc of c is defined to be dc a irr c d 2 a 2 3 ribbon categories a braided tensor category has for each pair of objects an iso morphism ca b homc a b b a called the braiding this is a natural isomorphism between the bifunctors and op and it satisfies the braid or hexagon relations the morphisms ca b and c 1 a b are represented respectively by the pictures a b and ba definition 2 3 a ribbon fusion category is a spherical and braided fusion category the ribbon structure is a natural isomorphism of the identity functor given by isomorphisms a homc a a called twists defined as follows a 1 a eva ca a 1 a coeva a in particular if a is simple a is a scalar multiple of the identity morphism 1 a as is common practice we often abuse notation and write a for this scalar the twist isomorphisms satisfy the ribbon axiom a b cb a ca b a b 2 4 modularity and the drinfel d center given a spherical fusion category c one can produce a canonical ribbon fusion category z c called the drinfel d center briefly z c is obtained as the category of c c bimodule endofunctors on c viewed as a c c bimodule category the objects of z c are given by a pair of an object from c and a half braiding that is the bimodule endofunctor f corresponds to the object f 1 c along with half braiding natural isomorphisms ef a f 1 a a f 1 for all objects a c coming from eigenvalues of rotations and braids in spherical fusion categories 7 the bimodule structure morphisms of f the drinfel d center is completely determined by the half braidings see egno 15 definition 7 13 1 for details most significantly for our purposes the drinfel d center of a spherical fusion category is always mu g 03 b a modular category definition 2 4 a ribbon fusion category is modular if the braiding is non degenerate i e if the s matrix is invertible the s matrix for a ribbon fusion category d with n simple objects is the n n matrix s 1 dd s where s a b tr cb a ca b a b the verlinde formula allows the fusion rules of a modular category d to be expressed in terms of entries of its s matrix nac d e irr c sc esd esa e s 1 e the s matrix along with the n n matrix t t where t a b a b a are together referred to as the modular data by ns 10 proposition 5 7 the entries of s and t are cyclotomic integers in q e 2 i m vafa s theorem asserts that all twists are roots of unity hence t is finite order the number m ord t is called the conductor of the category the charge conjugation matrix is the n n matrix c a b and the central charge is the positive square root of the ratio of the gauss sums for d 1 dd a ad 2 a if d is modular then this is always defined and a root of unity these matrices satisfy the following relations st 3 s 2 s 2 c c 2 1 cs sc ct tc which implies that 0 1 1 0 s 1 1 0 1 t is a projective representations of sl 2 z see bk 01 chapter 3 for all of the above results it was proved in ns 10 that this representation of sl 2 z factors through sl 2 zm 2 5 induction to the center consider the forgetful functor z c c this is given by forgetting the half braiding i e by sending the bimodule endofunctor f z c to the object f 1 c mu ger showed that the forgetful functor has a left adjoint i c z c called the central induction functor if we start with a ribbon fusion category d then where it sits inside its drinfel d center z d is particularly well understood define a new ribbon fusion category d such that d d as tensor categories but with a new braiding c a b c 1 b a 8 daniel barter corey jones and henry tucker which gives the following modular data s a b s 1 a b sa b and t a a 1 a for any ribbon fusion category we always have a braided tensor functor g d d z d where is the deligne tensor product of abelian categories if d is modular then by mu g 03 b theorem 7 10 g is a braided equivalence of tensor categories using g we can identify z d with d d under this identification the forgetful functor z d d is given by x y 7 x y along with forgetting about the braiding notice that g d 1 is a tensor equivalence onto its image hence any ribbon fusion category embeds as a full subcategory into a modular one in particular this implies the t matrix of a not necessarilly modular ribbon fusion category also has finite order which we also call the conductor thus in the case that d is modular we can recover the modular data for z d from the modular data of d and the structure of the forgetful functor z d d since the simple objects of z d are indexed by equivalence classes of a b we have the following identities sa b c d sa cs b d sa csb d a b a b these are a consequence of mu ger s result mentioned above their computation can be found in the proof of ns 10 lemma 6 2 at equations 6 5 and 6 6 3 rotation eigenvalues from here on out let c be a spherical fusion category 3 1 generalized rotation and gfs indicators for a spherical fusion category c recall that objects in the drinfel d center z c are pairs of objects b c with a half braiding natural isomorphism eb b b definition 3 1 ns 10 section 2 let c be a spherical fusion category for objects a c and b z c and positive integer n n we define the generalized rotation operator b n a homc b a n homc b a n given by f 7 eva 1 a n 1 a f 1 a eb a 1 a 1 b coeva which is expressed diagrammatically by an f b 7 an f b eigenvalues of rotations and braids in spherical fusion categories 9 the following properties of the generalized rotation are immediate 1 bn a n 1 b id 2 bn a is diagonalizable the traces of the generalized rotation operators provide a very important invariant of spher ical fusion categories definition 3 2 ns 10 definition 2 1 for an object a c in a spherical fusion category we define the generalized frobenius schur gfs indicators for n 0 k z and b z c bn k a tr b n a k where tr is the usual trace of a linear map remark a different version of these invariants were also studied in the hopf algebra setting in sz 12 chapter 8 where they are called equivariant fs indicators the two definitions coincide when b c is the unit object the usual categorical frobenius schur fs indicators are obtained in the special case where b 1 and then m a 1 m 1 a the following proposition enumerates some useful properties of gfs indicators proposition 3 3 ns 10 let a d c be objects in a spherical fusion category let b c z c and let l m n then 1 bm l a d bm l a bm l d if gcd m l 1 ns 10 corollary 5 5 2 b cm l a b m l a c m l a ns 10 remark 2 4 3 bm l a b m g l g ag where g gcd m l ns 10 proposition 2 8 4 if b is irreducible in z c then bm l km a kb bm l a ns 10 lemma 2 7 3 2 discrete fourier transform suppose we have a diagonalizable operator l on a finite dimensional vector space whose eigenvalues are n th roots of unity for some n we can recover the complete collection of eigenvalues of the operator knowing only the values tr lk for integers 1 k n let be a primitive n th root of unity for a vector x x 1 xn cn the discrete fourier transform dft written f x f x 1 f x n cn is defined by f x k n m 1 xm mk the operator f is invertible and f 1 x k 1 n n m 1 xm mk let km be the dimension of the eigenspace of l corresponding to the root of unity m consider the vector x k 1 kn then since tr l k n m 1 km mk it follows that f x tr l tr l 2 tr ln this implies the mth component of f 1 tr l tr l 2 tr ln will be the multiplicity km with which the eigenvalue m occurs for the operator l hence the inverse dft applied to the vector of traces of the powers of l will yield the eigenvalue multiplicity vector 10 daniel barter corey jones and henry tucker 3 3 eigenvalue multiplicities for any simple object b z c and any object a c all the eigenvalues of the rotation operator bn a are roots of 1 b so re normalizing by an n th root of b gives an operator whose eigenvalues are all roots of unity thus its eigenspaces are isotypic components for the corresponding cyclic group representation define the renormalized rotation operator bn a 1 n b b n a where 1 n b is an arbitrary but fixed root of b since b n a n 1 its eigenvalues are nth roots of unity hence we can use the discrete fourier transform to compute eigenvalue multiplicities of the renormalized rotation note that tr bn a k k n bn k a thus if is a n th root of unity the multiplicity of as an eigenvalue of rotation bn a is given by 1 n n k 1 k n bn k a k 1 n n k 1 bn k a 1 n b 1 k the root occurs in with the same multiplicity as 1 n appears in putting this all together we obtain the following proposition proposition 3 4 let c be a spherical fusion category for any a c and b irr z c the eigenvalues of bn a are n th roots of 1 b for such an its multiplicity as an eigenvalue is denoted p bn a 1 where p b n a x n 1 k 0 bn k a n x k in general if the object b z c is not irreducible but is semi simple we can define kbn a c irr z c n 1 c dim homz c c b p c n a 1 where is the kronecker delta 3 4 computing gfs indicators more for less it was shown by ng schauenburg in ns 07 a ns 10 that the gfs indicators for a spherical fusion category c can be computed from the modular data of the drinfel d center z c and the irr z c irr c matrix a induced from the forgetful functor forget z c c ab a dim homc forget b a the full gfs data can be given as a matrix definition 3 5 the gfs indicator matrix vm l is the irr z c irr c matrix defined by vm l b a bm l a for m 0 and l z with gcd m l 1 let denote the sl 2 z representation given by the modular data of z c let m l g denote the standard right action of sl 2 z on z 2 now we have the following useful facts theorem 3 6 ns 10 1 let gcd m l 1 and g sl 2 z such that 1 0 g 1 m l then vm l g a ns 10 theorem 5 4 2 factors through a finite group ns 10 theorem 7 1 eigenvalues of rotations and braids in spherical fusion categories 11 this shows that if the modular data and linear structure of the forgetful functor are at hand then all gfs indicators can be computed furthermore only finitely many numbers appear since factors through a finite group the purpose of this section is to show that we can actually compute all the gfs indicators from only the single rotation higher indicators bn 1 a suppose n n and let n be a primitive nth root of unity if gcd k n 1 let k n denote the galois automorphism on the cyclotomic field q n which acts by n kn let a c and b irr z c be fixed and pick an nth root of b proposition 3 7 for 1 k n 1 bn k a k n b k g n g g n b b n g 1 a g where g gcd k n proof as in the previous section define the operator bn a 1 n b b n a then b n a is diagonal izable and bn a n id hence the eigenvalues of are powers of n and tr l z it is clear that if gcd k n 1 then k n bn k a tr k k n tr k n 1 n bn 1 a hence the formula is true in this case it is then easy to see the general result since bn k a b n g k g ag for g gcd n k remark 3 8 given a spherical fusion category c one can compute the fs indicators from the matrix induced from the central induction functor as well as t for the center gannon and morrison have outlined an effective procedure for finding a finite set of possibilities for the central induction and t matrix pairs for the center using the fusion rule of c alone which often but not always yields a unique such pair gm 16 given an induction and t matrix pair that does not actually correspond to a categorification of a given fusion rule there seems to be no reason a priori why these numbers should live in the right number field suitable for applying the galois automorphisms in the first place or that the multiplicities of the eigenvalues should add up to the number as determined by the fusion rules understanding this would add an additional layer to the procedure of gannon and morrison which could help to rule out extraneous possibilities of s and t pairs or even to show that certain fusion rules admit no categorifications 3 5 fs indicator rigidity letr be a fusion ring ocneanu rigidity says that there are only finitely many categorifications of r in general one would like to classify all categorifications definition 3 9 a fusion ring r exhibits fs indicator rigidity if two spherical categori fications of r having the same fs indicator data implies that they are equivalent as fusion categories to be more precise let r be the fusion ring over z with canonical basis rb bi ni 1 and let c be a spherical categorification of r meaning we have an identification of irr c with rb that induces a fusion ring homomorphism let m be the order of the t matrix for z c recall that the usual fs indicators are given by j a 1 j 1 a then c has the m n fs indicator matrix vc i bj i j this matrix captures all the information about the higher indicators since the sequence j a is m periodic by ns 07 a theorem 5 5 hence the fusion ring r has fs indicator rigidity if equality of the fs indicator matrices vc vd for two spherical categorifications c and d of r implies that c d several families of fusion rings have been shown to exhibit indicator rigidity one well known example are the tambara yamagami fusion rings bj 15 richard ng has asked 12 daniel barter corey jones and henry tucker whether all fusion rings generated by a simple object exhibit indicator rigidity but we present a negative answer here from quadratic categories recall the haagerup fusion ring h z 1 g g 2 g g 2 with mulitplication given by g 3 1 g g 2 and 2 1 g g 2 proposition 3 10 the fusion ring h does not exhibit fs indicator rigidity proof izumi constructed two inequivalent unitary categorifications of this ring and found their drinfel d centers and induction matrices evans and gannon found that the drinfel d centers of categories with this type of fusion ring i e haargerup izumi fusion categories have modular data given by a metric group that is a finite abelian group with a non degenerate quadratic form for the case of categories with ring h the group is z 13 see eg 15 6 3 in tuc 15 the third author demonstrates that the fs indicator data is entirely determined by the quadratic form and from eg 15 theorem 3 ii we see that izumi s two unitary categorifications correspond to the same quadratic form in fact not only are the indicators the same but the generalized indicators are the same not only are the modular data for the centers of the two categorifications equivalent but the a matrices from their forgetful functors are also equal this counterexample also demonstrates that even the stronger condition of asking for all generalized fs indicator data to be the same is not sufficient to establish a similar rigidity property for general fusion rings even for gfs indicators 3 6 annular representation theory while indicator rigidity is not true in general an interesting question remains in determining criteria on a fusion ring which would imply indicator rigidity in this direction we have determined a weaker rigidity property satisfied by unitary or c fusion categories that categorify a singly generated fusion ring restricting to the unitary setting allows us to utilize jones s theory of planar algebras the celebrated jones polynomial knot invariant can be obtained from skein theory as well as the representation theory of quantum groups tin 17 these two methods rely on a com mon category called the temperley lieb jones category or algebroid and denoted t lj in the setting of quantum groups this is the tensor category of finite dimensional representations of the quantum group uq sl 2 where q q 1 in the setting of planar al gebras t lj is obtained as the semisimple idempotent completion of the temperley lieb algebroid which has a familiar diagrammatic description due to kauffman kau 87 under this construction the simple objects of t lj are the well known jones wenzl idempotents this realization is a refinement of a category of skein modules see tur 16 for details for our purposes the simple objects of t lj are just natural numbers n n and morphism spaces homt lj n m are spanned by rectangular diagrams with n bottom points and m top points with non crossing arcs pairing the points i e temperley lieb diagrams on n m points composition of morphisms is by stacking diagrams and closed circles evaluate to the number the category t lj is semisimple unless 2 cos n n 3 from here on we will assume is a semisimple value this category is universal in the sense that given any unitary rigid tensor category c generated by a symmetrically self dual object there exists a unique dominant dimension preserving monoidal functor t lj c eigenvalues of rotations and braids in spherical fusion categories 13 note that t lj is not a fusion category since there are infinitely many simple objects hence we lose much of the good behavior of the drinfel d center there have been several approaches to understanding half braidings for this purpose jones introduced the annular temperley lieb category or algebroid annt l its irreducible unitary modules yield half braidings for objects in t lj in the annular temperley lieb algebroid objects are again given by natural numbers and morphisms are given by the span of annular temperley lieb diagrams these are diagrams on an annulus with n points on the inner boundary and m points on the outer boundary for formal definitions see jr 06 and jon 01 and note that this object is called the affine temperley lieb algebroid in jon 01 with a likewise change to the notation this category is quite far away from being semi simple and it is not even a tensor category its representation category while still being non semi simple is a braided tensor category see dgg 14 a more purely categorical approach to understanding this representation category is pro vided by neshveyev and yamashita in ny 16 they show that the representation category for the annular temperley lieb algebroid is equivalent to the drinfel d center of the ind category definition 3 11 ny 16 2 2 let c be a semisimple unitary tensor category the category ind c is given as follows objects inductive systems in c x uji homc xi xj i j where the uji are isometries morphisms t x y collections of morphisms in c t tki homc xi yk such that tkjuji tki if i j v lktli tki if k l sup k i tki an object v of ind c is called locally finite if v ind c satisfies dim homind c a v for all a c jones s annular representation category is equivalent to z ind t lj as braided tensor categories using the annular approach jones and jones reznikoff establish a classification of unitary locally finite irreducible representations for the representation category of the annular also called affine in jr 06 temperley lieb algebroid this provides us the following proposition 3 12 jon 01 jr 06 an irreducible locally finite unitary object v z ind t lj is classified up to isomorphism by the following data 1 a number n 0 called the lowest weight of v such that vk 0 for k n and vn 6 0 2 for n 0 a scalar s 1 which is the rotation eigenvalue for n 0 a number 0 2 which is the eigenvalue of the double closed loop 14 daniel barter corey jones and henry tucker every locally finite unitary object of z ind c is semi simple jon 01 i e every such object is isomorphic to a possibly infinite direct sum of simple obects note that at each weight space only finitely many such simple objects can appear by local finiteness by the proposition above each simple vn for n 0 is classified up to isomorphism by the set of eigenvalues of the rotation operator the only exception is the weight 0 part where there is no rotation this gives us the following corollary corollary 3 13 locally finite unitary objects v z ind t lj with a fixed weight 0 component v 0 are classified up to isomorphism by the set of eigenvalues n of the rotation operator on each vn for n 0 3 7 annular fs indicator rigidity now again let c be a spherical fusion category we now give the definition of jones s planar algebras in categorical terms definition 3 14 let x c such that dx 2 and define p xn homc 1 x x n then the spherical structure makes the system p x a commutative algebra object in z ind t lj called the planar algebra for x c note that dx the algebra structure is given by the map evx in c now suppose r is a fusion ring and c and d are categorifications of r fix specified isomorphisms of c and d to r we say a b if a b r for a c and b d note that in particular a b implies they have the same dimension theorem 3 15 annular fs indicator rigidity suppose r is a fusion ring with two spherical categorifications c and d with equivalent fs indicator data i e such that vc vd if a c and b d with a b and da 2 then p a and p b are isomorphic as objects in z ind t lj z ind rep uq sl 2 proof it is clear that the weight 0 components of p a and p b are both given by the number d 2 a d 2 b hence have isomorphic weight 0 components by corollary 3 13 it suffices to show that the eigenvalues of the rotation are the same as sets for all non zero weights since the fs indicator data is the same combining theorem 3 4 and theorem 3 7 yields the desired result 4 eigenvalues for braid group representations from ribbon categories 4 1 braid group actions and their spectra let d be a ribbon fusion category the braid group bn acts on the vector space homc b an via the braiding in the category we call the corresponding representation ba n bn gl homd b an given an object a d the tensor structure ond gives an inclusion endd an endd an 1 which is compatible with the natural inclusion bn bn 1 the braiding gives the following homomorphism a n bn endd an taking colimits gives the homomorphism a b nendd an eigenvalues of rotations and braids in spherical fusion categories 15 this implies that the spectrum of a n g only depends on the conjugacy class of g inside b in other words the representations of our braid group are local furthermore suppose a braid x is conjugate in b to some braid y bn then to determine the spectrum of a x it suffices to determine the spectrum of ba n y acting on homd b a n for all b irr d in other words spec a x b irr d spec ba n y 4 2 diagonalizing consider for l m 0 l m n the jucys murphy elements of the braid group bn given by anl m m l note that we could define a n l m similarly with over and under crossings switched and the rest of this section follows from similar arguments letting i be the standard braid group generators inside b i is conjugate to a 2 0 0 and i 1 i i 1 i i 1 i is conjugate to a 3 1 0 using the results from the last section we can compute the eigenvalues for anl m under the above representations in terms of generalized frobenius schur indicators let c be ribbon fusion and let a b c we define the linear isomorphisms v nl m homc b a n homc al m b an l m by the following formulae v nl m f eval 1 an m l evam 1 al f 1 am 1 al cam b v nl m an f b 7 n m l l m f b a a 16 daniel barter corey jones and henry tucker let g c c z c be the usual inclusion then g al m b al m b cam l 1 b 1 al c b if we identify c c with its image under g then we have v nl m 1 a l m b n m l a v n l m a b a a n l m the picture is given by let m ord t for the ribbon fusion category c the rotation operator a l m b n m l a is diagonalizable with respect to some basis of eigenvectors bi m n m l i 1 ordered by the eigenvalue count established in the previous section therefore the operator a b a a n l m is diagonalizable with basis v nl m 1 bi this implies corollary 4 1 1 a a n l m is diagonalizable and a a n l m m n m l 1 2 given an m n m l th root of unity the complex number 1 a occurs as an eigenvalue of ba n a n l m with multiplicity k al m b n m 1 a thus the computation of the eigenvalues for anl m reduces to computing the eigenvalues of appropriate rotation operators which we know how to do in terms of ng schauenburg indicators if c happens to be modular we can compute these eigenvalues in terms of the modular data s and t as we demonstrate explicitly in the next section now we suppose c is modular with modular data s t with ord t m in this case g c c z c is an equivalence again assume a is fixed so kbn refers to the multiplicity of in bn a where is a some nm th root of unity and b z c specializing the formulae from above to n 2 we see that for a 2 m th root of unity we have kc b 2 2 b c 2 1 c b 2 1 a n b c a a recall from section 2 that sc b d e sc dsb e and a b a b so we have the following formula which was first derived in ns 10 proposition 6 1 c b 2 1 a d e irr c d e 2 sc dsb en a d e combining these formulae gives eigenvalues of rotations and braids in spherical fusion categories 17 proposition 4 2 let c be a modular category with modular data s t and let be a 2 m th root of unity then a b 2 a contains eigenvalue with multiplicity kc b 2 2 b c 1 2 1 d e irr c d e 2 sc dsb en a d e n b c a a in particular kc b 2 is a non negative integer and spec c b 2 a if and only if kc b 2 0 remark it was shown earlier by ns 10 theorem 8 3 that the expression in parentheses in proposition 4 2 is a non negative integer it appears somewhat surprising that this number is a non negative integer in general using the verlinde formula we can compute the terms n bc a a in the sum in terms of the s matrix and thus the above formula is entirely expressible in terms of the modular data in b i is conjugate to a 20 0 and i i 1 i is conjugate to a 3 1 0 this implies 1 spec a i 1 a k 1 b 2 6 0 for some b c 2 spec a i i 1 i 1 a ka b 2 6 0 for some b c remark 4 3 note that this allows us to compute the link invariants for the closures of powers of braids anm l in terms of generalized fs indicators hence also in terms of the modular data when c is modular for example for the closure of the braid ap 0 0 q is the p q torus link and thus above observations given a formula for this invariant in terms of the dimensions twists and bp q this class of examples is directly computable from the gfs indicators without first determining the eigenvalues but other examples will require more interesting interactions with the eigenvalues themselves it would be interesting to determine general classes of links whose invariants can be obtained this way and precise formulae in terms of the modular data 4 3 an example from the haagerup fusion category as an example we consider the quadratic fusion category haag corresponding to the even part of the haagerup subfactor this is the standard categorification of the fusion ring h given in section 3 5 then the modular data for the center z haag is well known and was first computed by izumi in izu 01 we use here the form from eg 11 s 1 3 x 1 x 1 1 1 1 y y y y y y 1 x x 1 1 1 1 y y y y y y 1 1 2 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 2 0 0 0 0

demonstration of our formula we consider the 6 th simple object x 6 we chose this object because it has multiplicity 2 objects in the decomposition of its tensor square but our formula is easy to
