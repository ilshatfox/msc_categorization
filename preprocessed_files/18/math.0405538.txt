show that the sheafication of graded koszul mod ules k over n k x 0 x 1 xn form an important subcategory k of the coherents sheaves on projective space coh pn one reason is that any co herent sheave over pn belongs to k up to shift more importantly the category k allows a concept of almost split se quence obtained by exploiting koszul duality between graded koszul modules over and over the exterior algebra this is then used to develop a kind of relative auslander reiten theory for the category coh pn with respect to this theory all but finitely many auslander reiten components for coh pn have the shape za we also describe the remaining ones 1 introduction the aim of the paper is to apply the methods of non commutative algebra and very particularly of finite dimensional algebras to the study of sheaves on projective space as well as to some non commutative generalizations the starting point for this approach was the paper by bernsntein gelfand gelfand in which they proved that there exists a derived equivalence of categories mod d b coh pn bgg between the stable category mod of the exterior algebra k x 0 x 1 xn x 2 i xixj xjxi and the derived category of bounded complexes of coherent sheaves over projective space it is of interest to know which modules over the exterior algebra correspond to particular sheaves over projective space for example which modules correspond to locally free sheaves which to torsion free sheaves the answer to the first question was given by j bernstein and s gelfand bg who proved that vector bundles over pn correspond to nice modules over the exterior algebra we will give here a different characterization of the modules over the exterior algebra corresponding to the locally free sheaves on projective space 2 some basic facts on vector bundles over projective space for the convenience of the reader and to fix notation we recall in this sec tion standard theorems of algebraic geometry on sheaves and vector bundles over projective space we will consider graded quiver algebras kq i where k is a field q a finite connected quiver and i an homogeneous ideal in the grading given by path length date august 21 2003 1991 mathematics

let gr be the category of graded modules and degree zero maps in order to prove the main results it seems to be essential to assume is noetherian hence we will assume it we will denote by gr the full subcategory of all finitely generated graded modules we will say that a graded modules m is torsion if it is a sum of submodules of finite length in particular if m is finitely generated it is torsion when it is of finite length for a given module m we will denote by t m the sum of all submodules of finite length given two graded modules x and y we denote by hom x y n the set of all maps f x y such that f xi yi n by homgr x y the maps in degree zero and hom x y i z hom x y i let qgr be the quotient category with the same objects as gr denote by gr qgr the quotient functor the maps in qgr are defined as homqgr x y 0 lim hom x y y 0 where the limit is taken over all pairs x y of submodules of x and y respectively such that x x and y are torsion we define homqgr x y n z lim hom x y y n given a graded module x we define the truncated module x n as follows x n j 0 if j n and x n j xj if j n the following result is well known s 2 m 2 proposition 1 let kq i be a noetherian graded quiver algebra then if x is a graded finitely generated module and y is an arbitrary module then we have isomorphisms homqgr x y m lim hom x n y m for all m it is well known p s 2 qgr has injective envelopes and the extension groups extkqgr x y m are obtained as derived functors ofhomqgr x y m it follows extkqgr x y m lim extk x n y m theorem 1 serre se let k be a field k x 0 x 1 xr i be the quotient of

hq f were defined by cech we refer to the reader to serre s paper for definitions and for the proof of the isomor phisms hq f hq x f where hq x denotes the derived functor of the global sections

definition 1 a sheaf f is locally free if and only if x can be covered by open sets u for which f u is a free ox u module we will need the following well known characterization of algebraic vector bun dles proposition 2 l the functor which associates the sheaf of modules of regular sections to a vector bundle e is an equivalence of categories between the category of algebraic vector bundles over x and the category of locally free sheaves of finite rank on x the following result will be also needed theorem 3 serre se let x pr be projective space then a coherent sheaf f is locally free if and only if hq x f n 0 for n 0 and 0 q r we can prove now the following proposition 3 let k x 0 x 1 xr be the polynomial algebra and f m m the sheaf associated to a finitely generated module m then f is locally free if and only if lim ext j m t s 0 0 for s 0 and 0 j r proof it is easy to see m n k m k n n by serre duality homk lim ext q j k m n 0 k lim ext r q m n k r 1 0 lim ext j m k n n r 1 0 lim

results given here were proved in bgs adl gm 1 gm 2 see also the references given there definition 2 let kq i be a graded quiver algebra a finitely generated module m with minimal graded projective resolution pk pk 1 p 1 p 0 m 0 with each pj finitely generated is called quasi koszul if and only if j k m km j 2 pk 1 for any k 1 4 roberto marti nez villa the module m is called weakly koszul if and only if jj k m km jj 1 pk 1 for any j 0 and any k 1 the module m is koszul if and only if each pj is finitely generated in degree j a graded algebra is called koszul if and only if all graded simple generated in degree zero are koszul definition 3 let be a graded quiver algebra and m a module with minimal graded injective co resolution 0 m i 0 i 1 ik with each ik finitely cogenerated 1 we say that m is quasi co koszul if for any j 0 there exist an epimorphism soc 2 ij 1 socij 2 soc j m 0 2 if for any pair of positive integers j and k there are epimorphisms sock 2 ij 1 soc k 1 ij 2 soc k 1 j m sock j m 0 then we say m is weakly co koszul 3 if for all non negative integers j the injective module ij is cogenerated in degree j then we say m is co koszul remark 1 weakly koszul co koszul modules were called strongly quasi koszul quasi co koszul in gm 1 gm 2 we will denote by k the category of koszul modules and degree zero maps by the yoneda algebra k 0 extk 0 0 and by f gr gr op the ext functor f m k 0 extk m 0 theorem 4 let kq i be a koszul algebra with yoneda algebra then the following statements hold 1 the algebra is koszul with yoneda algebra k 0 extk 0 0 2 if k and k op denote the category of koszul and opmodules respectively then the ext functor induces a duality f k k op such that f j km k kf m k and jkf m k f km k we are interested in the following examples of koszul algebras 1 the polynomial algebra k x 0 x 1 xr is a koszul algebra with yoneda algebra the exterior algebra k x 0 x 1 xr x 2 i xixj xjxi 2 if is a koszul k algebra and g a finite group of automorphisms of such that chark g and is the yoneda algebra of then g acts on and the skew group algebra g is koszul with yoneda algebra g m 4 in the examples above the exterior algebra is selfinjective and given a finite group of automorphisms of the k algebra such that the chark g then the skew group algebra g is selfinjective if and only if is rr the following theorem characterizes selfinjective koszul algebras it was proved first in the connected case by p s smith theorem 5 s 1 m 3 let be a finite dimensional indecomposable koszul algebra with yoneda algebra then the following statements are equivalent 1 the algebra is selfinjective with radical j such that jr 1 6 0 and jr 2 0 2 i the graded op simple have projective dimension r 1 ii for any graded simple module s the equality exti op s 0 for i 6 r 1 iii the functor extr 1 op induces a bijection between the graded and op simple modules koszul algebras and sheaves 5 definition 4 we will call a graded algebra satisfying conditions i ii iii artin shelter regular as remark 2 these algebras were called generalized auslander regular in gmt m 2 m 3 another example of artin shelter regular koszul algebra is the preprojective algebra k q i of a non dynkin bipartite graph q its yoneda algebra is the trivial extension algebra kq d kq m 1 gmt we will need the following results from m 5 mm theorem 6 let kq i be a koszul algebra and m and n two koszul modules then for any pair of integers k and l with k 0 the following two statements are true i if extk m n l 0 6 0 then k l ii if k l then there exists a vector space isomorphism extk m n l 0 ext k l op f n l f m 0 theorem 7 let be an infinite dimensional koszul algebra with yoneda algebra and let f gr gr op be koszul duality f m k 0 extk m 0 then for any pair of koszul modules m and n any integer p and an integer n 0 there exist a functorial isomorphism lim extn j km n p lim extn op k pf n kf m p corollary 1 under the conditions of the theorem if we assume in addition selfinjective the isomorphism becomes lim extn j km n p ext n op pf n f m p 4 main results let k x 0 x 1 xr be the polynomial algebra k x 0 x 1 xr x 2 i xixj xjxi the exterior algebra gr qgr the quotient functor we are interested in finitely generated graded modules m such that m corresponds to a locally free sheaf under serre s equivalence by the approximation proposition m 3 given a finitely generated module m there exists an integer k such that m k k n is koszul we know p s 2 that for two graded modules x and y there exists an integer k such that x k y k if and only if x y it follows m n k hence we may assume m is koszul up to shifting this is there exists some integer k such that m k is koszul using koszul duality f k k op we want to characterize the koszul modules n such that f n is locally free definition 5 let be an indecomposable noetherian artin shelter regular koszul algebra of global dimension r 1 let gr qgr be the quotient functor and m a finitely generated module we say that m is locally free if lim ext j m t s 0 0 for s 0 and 0 j r see also bgk observe that if m is locally free and k is an integer then m k is locally free we have m k t m k t k set s s k and k t t then there exists a chain of isomorphisms 6 roberto marti nez villa lim ext j m k t s 0 lim ext j m k t k s 0 lim ext j m k t s k 0 lim ext j m t s 0 0 for s 0 and 0 j r we remarked above that for any finitely generated module m there exists some integer k such that m k k is koszul we are interested in koszul op modules m such that f m is locally free theorem 8 let be an indecomposable selfinjective koszul algebra with jr 1 6 0 and jr 2 0 assume the yoneda algebra is noetherian let f k k op be koszul duality then a koszul module n has the property that f n is locally free if and only if ext j s 0 s n 0 0 for 0 j r and s 0 proof by theorem 7 we have natural isomorphisms lim ext j op j kf n s 0 lim ext j op j kf n s lim ext j k sf 1 kn s lim ext j k s 0 s kn 0 ext j s 0 s n 0 it follows f n is locally free if and only if ext j s 0 s n 0 0 for 0 j r and s 0 corollary 2 let n be a koszul module then for any positive integer k the module kn k is such that f kn k is locally free if and only if f n is locally free proof ext j s 0 s kn k 0 ext j s k 0 s k n 0 0 for s 0 lemma 1 let kq i be a graded quiver algebra let m and n be graded modules generated in degree l and k respectively with l k then there is a natural isomorphism ext 1 m n 0 ext 1 m j l kn 0 proof the exact sequence 0 j l kn n n j l kn 0 induces an exact sequence hom m n j l kn 0 ext 1 m j l kn 0 e xt 1 m n 0 where hom m n j l kn 0 0 we must prove is an epimorphism let x ext 1 m n 0 then the exact sequence x 0 n e m 0 induces an exact commutative diagram 0 n l e l m 0 1 0 n e m 0 with n l j l kn and we have proved is an epimorphism proposition 4 let be an indecomposable selfinjective koszul algebra with jr 1 6 0 and jr 2 0 assume the yoneda algebra is noetherian and let f k k op be the koszul duality let 0 x y z 0 be an exact sequence of koszul modules and degree zero maps then the following statements hold 1 if f x and f z are locally free then f y is locally free 2 if f x and f y are locally free then f z is locally free koszul algebras and sheaves 7 proof 1 the exact sequence 0 x y z 0 of koszul modules induces an exact sequence exti s 0 s x 0 ext i s 0 s y 0 ext i s 0 s z 0 by hypothesis exti s 0 s x 0 ext i s 0 s z 0 0 for 0 i r and s 0 hence exti s 0 s y 0 0 for 0 i r and s 0 2 let k be an integer k r 1 and l a torsion free module it was proved in m 2 extk op l 0 hence ext k op l j 0 for all j and k r 1 if f x is torsion free then using lemma 1 and theorem 6 we have a chain of natural isomorphisms extk s 0 s x 0 ext 1 k s 1 0 s x 0 ext 1 k s 1 0 s j k 1 x 0 ext 1 op k 1 f x s jk s 1 f 0 0 ext 1 op k 1 f x s f 0 0 extk op f x f 0 s ext k op f x s 0 for k r 1 assume f x has torsion and let s 1 be a simple in the socle then there is an integer k such that jkf x f kx s 1 w 1 applying f 1 there is an isomorphism kx p 1 x 1 but since p 1 is projective injective k 0 and s 1 appears at the top of f x we have proved f x s w with s semisimple and w torsion free hence x p x with p projective and x is such that f x is locally free we have an exact sequence exti s 0 s y 0 ext i s 0 s z 0 ext i 1 s 0 s x 0 by hypothesis and the above remark for 0 i r and s 0 we have exti s 0 s y 0 0 ext i 1 s 0 s x 0 hence exti s 0 s z 0 0 for 0 i r and s 0 proposition 5 let be an indecomposable selfinjective koszul algebra with jr 1 6 0 and jr 2 0 assume the yoneda algebra is noetherian and let f k k op be the koszul duality then the following statement holds if x is a koszul module such that f x is locally free then jx 1 is such that f jx 1 is locally free proof let x be a koszul module such that f x is locally free let 0 x p x 0 be exact with p the projective cover of x it induces an exact sequence 0 x 1 jp 1 jx 1 0 by corollary 2 f x 1 is locally free if p is projective generated in degree zero and m is a koszul module then from the exact sequence 0 jp 1 p 1 s 1 0 we obtain an exact sequence 0 hom m jp 1 0 hom m p 1 0 hom m s 1 0 ext 1 m jp 1 0 0 and isomorphisms ext j 1 m s 1 0 ext j m jp 1 0 since m is generated in degree zero and j 1 m in degree j 1 it follows hom m s 1 0 0 and ext j 1 m s 1 0 0 therefore ext j m jp 1 0 0 for j 0 letting m be equal to s 0 s we get ext i s 0 s jp 1 0 0 for all s 0 and all i 0 8 roberto marti nez villa we have proved f jp 1 is locally free it follows by 2 of previous propo sition f jx 1 is locally free we will consider now the case r 1 theorem 9 let be an artin shelter regular koszul algebra of global dimension 2 and assume is noetherian indecomposable with yoneda algebra let f k k op be the koszul duality a koszul module m is such that f m is locally free if and only if m ss s for a simple module s and some integer s 0 proof a koszul module m is such that f m is locally free if and only if ext 1 s 0 s m 0 0 for s 0 equivalently if and only if the maps module projectives hom s 1 0 s m 0 0 for s 0 assume m ts t with s a simple module and let s t then hom s 1 0 s ts t 0 hom s t 1 0 s t s 0 but s t 1 s s t is generated in degree 1 hence hom s t 1 0 s t s 0 0 conversely assume m is not isomorphic to ss s for any simple s and any s there is an isomorphism hom s 1 0 s m 0 hom 0 s 1 m s 0 if the loewy length of m is two then socm is generated in degree one we have an exact sequence 0 m p p 1 m 0 with p generated in degree 1 since 1 m is not projective p socp 0 and loewy length of 1 m 2 if 1 m is not simple then soc 1 m 1 is generated in degree 1 it follows by induction soc sm s is generated in degree 1 hence s 1 m s has socle in degree zero and hom 0 s 1 m s 0 6 0 for all s in the general case we have the following remarks proposition 6 let be an indecomposable artin shelter regular noetherian koszul algebra of global dimension r 1 with yoneda algebra let f k k op be the koszul duality let n be a koszul module such that f n is locally free then there exists some integer s such that sn s is not koszul proof assume for all s 0 the module sn s is koszul the fact f n is locally free implies for s 0 and 0 j r there are isomorphisms hom s j 0 s n 0 hom j 0 sn s 0 hom 0 s jn s 0 0 by hypothesis the module x s jn s j is koszul consider the exact sequence 0 x p 1 x 0 with p the injective envelope of x since 1 x 1 is koszul then socx is generated in degree r if j r then x j has socle generated in degree zero and hom 0 x j 0 hom 0 s jn s 0 6 0 is a contradiction we have the following characterization of the koszul modules m with f m locally free theorem 10 let be an indecomposable noetherian artin shelter regular koszul algebra of global dimension r 1 with yoneda algebra let f k k op be the koszul duality then an indecomposable koszul module m is such that f m is locally free if and only if there exists an integer s 0 such that sm s 1 0 proof assume f m is locally free and suppose for all s 0 the module sm s 1 6 0 we know by mz there exists an integer s such that sm s is weakly co koszul koszul algebras and sheaves 9 let x sm s and let 0 x q 1 x 0 be exact with q the injective envelope of x since x is weakly co koszul the epimorphism q socq 1 x 0 induces an epimorphism soc 2 q socq soc 1 x 0 this means that if x has a cogenerator in degree k then 1 x has a cogenerator in degree k 1 and 1 x 1 has a cogenerator in degree k the module m is generated in degree zero then it has cogenerators in degree k with k r and 1 m 1 has cogenerators in degree r it follows by in duction x has cogenerators in degree r by hypothesis sm s 1 6 0 then sm s has a cogenerator in degree k with 1 k r it follows for all t 0 the module t sm t s has cogenerator in lowest degree 1 k r then k s t m s t has a cogenerator in degree zero and it follows hom 0 k s t m s t 0 6 0 hence ext k 0 l m 0 6 0 for all s a contradiction assume now there exists an s such that sm s 1 0 and setx sm s as above if x has a cogenerator in lowest degree k then 1 x 1 has a cogen erator in lowest degree k it follows for all t 0 the module s t m s t 1 0 hence for all 0 j r the module j s t m s t has cogenerators in degree less than zero it follows hom 0 j s t m s t 0 0 for all t 0 and 0 j r we have proved f m is locally free corollary 3 let and be as in the theorem let m be a koszul and quasi co koszul module then f m is locally free if and only if m is simple proof it is clear that if m is simple then f m is projective and f m locally free assume m is not simple then m has cogenerators in degree k with r k 0 hence m 1 6 0 as in the proof of the theorem sm s has cogenerators in degree k 0 therefore hom 0 k sm s 0 6 0 for all s 0 it follows f m is not locally free we can improve now the characterization of the modules corresponding to locally free sheaves theorem 11 let be an indecomposable noetherian artin schelter regular koszul algebra of global dimension r 1 with yoneda algebra let f k k op be koszul duality then an indecomposable koszul module m is such that f m is locally free if and only if there exists a non negative integer t such that tm t is co koszul proof assume there exists an integer t 0 such that tm t is co koszul by hypothesis tm t is cogenerated in degree zero this means tm t 1 0 applying theorem 10 it follows f m is locally free we assume now f m is locally free by theorem 10 there exists an integer t 0 such that tm t 1 0 let s be a simple in the socle of tm t by hypothesis s is generated in degree k 0 suppose k 0 then ts is generated in degree k t and m t is generated in degree t with k t t it follows hom ts m t 0 0 10 roberto marti nez villa we have isomorphisms hom s tm t 0 hom s tm t 0 hom ts m t 0 and hom s tm t 0 6 0 since the natural inclu sion j s tm t is not zero we have reached a contradiction proving soc tm t is generated in degree zero let s t it is clear sm s 1 0 hence soc sm s is generated in degree zero it follows tm t is co koszul theorem 12 let and be koszul algebras satisfying the conditions of theorem 11 and f k k op be koszul duality let m be a koszul module such that f m is locally free then there exists a semisimple module s finitely generated in degree zero a non negative integer t and an epimorphism ts t m 0 proof let t be a non negative integer such that tm t is co koszul and let s be the socle of tm t the inclusion j s tm t induces a non zero map tj ts m t we want to prove that tj is an epimorphism assume tj is not an epimorphism then there exists a simple s generated in degree zero and a non zero map h m t s t such that h tj 0 therefore th j 0 and ker th soc tm t let t be a simple module contained in soc im th taking the pull back of the inclusion i we obtain a commutative exact diagram 0 ker th soc tm t w t 0 1 i 0 ker th soc tm t tm t soc tm t im th 0 since tm t is cogenerated in degree zero wk 6 0 implies k 0 therefore w has all its generators in negative degrees it follows t is generated in nega tive degree but this is a contradiction since soc im th soc ts t and soc ts t is generated in degree zero 5 the auslander reiten quiver of k in this section we study the auslander reiten quiver of the category k of koszul modules over a selfinjective koszul algebra we recall from gmrsz that if m is an indecomposable koszul module then there exists an auslander sequence 0 m e m 0 in k ending at m this sequence is constructed as follows we first look at the auslander reiten sequence ending at m in gr 0 m f m 0 and then if we define m m 0 and e f 0 it turns out that m is an indecomposable koszul module and we also get that the induced sequence is an auslander reiten sequence in k thus k has left a r sequences also note that m has loewy length exactly two hence it is also a j 2 module we also mention that if 0 a b c 0 is an a r sequence in k then it is also an a r sequence in the category of graded modules finitely generated in degree zero gr 0 this will be used through the section lemma 2 let 0 a b c 0 be a non split exact sequence in k then the induced sequence 0 a b c 0 is also exact in k proof since for each i 0 we have j ia j ib a we know from mz that the exactness of 0 a b c 0 implies that we have an induced exact sequence 0 a b c 0 the lemma follows immediately from the definition of the main tool that will be used very often is the following result from gmrsz koszul algebras and sheaves 11 lemma 3 let l denote the full subcategory of gr 0 consisting of the mod ules m having a linear presentation that is a projective presentation of the form p 1 p 0 m 0 where p 1 is generated in degree 1 and p 0 is generated in degree zero then j 2 l gr 0 j 2 is an equivalence of categories the following results are true in a more general setting for certain subcategories of the graded module category of a finite dimensional algebra having left auslander reiten sequences they are part of the finite dimensional algebra folklore and we include proofs only for our more restricted needs proposition 7 let m be an indecomposable non projective koszul module and let 0 m f e g m 0 be the a r sequence in k ending at m let f f 1 f 2 fk and g g 1 g 2 gk t where e e 1 e 2 ek and for each 1 i k ei is indecomposable in k then for each 1 i k the maps fi and gi are irreducible in k proof first note that by construction the sequence 0 m f e g m 0 is also an a r sequence in gr 0 we show more generally that the maps are in fact irreducible in gr 0 assume now we have a factorization of gi in gr 0 ei gi m j h x and that h is a not splittable epimorphism then we have an induced factorization ei e i gi g i m j 0 0 1 h g i x e i where e i i 6 s es lets us show that h g i is not a splittable epimorphism if it is there exists a morphism s t m x e i such that h g i s t 1 m and we have hs g it 1 m the composition g it is an endomorphism of m and since g i is not a splittable epimorphism the image is in the radical of endm hence g it is nilpotent therefore hs 1 g it is invertible in endm so h is a splittable epimorphism contradicting our assumption on h this means that we can lift h g i to ei e i and we obtain the following commutative diagram with exact rows 0 m ei e i gi g i m 0 j 0 0 1 0 k x e i h g i m 0 a b c d 0 m ei e i gi g i m 0 12 roberto marti nez villa in the composite diagram 0 m ei e i gi g i m 0 aj b cj d 0 m ei e i gi g i m 0 we observe that cannot be nilpotent otherwise a simple argument would show that 1 m factors through ei e i contradicting our assumptions since m is indecomposable must be invertible thus aj b cj d a b c d j 0 0 1 is invertible so the matrix j 0 0 1 is a splittable monomorphism so there exists a map x y z w that is a left inverse of j 0 0 1 and we obtain xj 1 so that j is a splittable monomorphism proving that gi is an irreducible morphism we show in a similar way that each fi is also an irreducible morphism it turns out that each irreducible morphism in gr 0 is either a monomorphism or an epimorphism for instance assume that we have a map f e m that is irreducible in gr 0 if f is not onto then since x imf is again generated in degree zero we have a factorization e f m s t x and this implies that s is a splittable monomorphism hence f is also a monomorphism this implies that if 0 m f e g m 0 is an a r sequence in k and f f 1 f 2 fk and g g 1 g 2 gk t then for each i the morphisms fi and gi are either monomorphisms or epimorphisms we recall the following definition assume that the subcategory c has left auslander reiten sequences and let m c the cone of m is the subquiver of the a r quiver of c consisting of m and its predecessors let now m be a non projective koszul module over an indecomposable selfinjective koszul algebra of loewy length r 1 for example the exterior algebra r 1 v where v is a k vector space of dimension r 1 and r 2 we will describe the cone of m in k by analyzing the cone of m j 2 m in the a r quiver of gr j 2 namely using the auslander reiten quiver of gr j 2 and gmrsz we see that two of the com ponents of the a r quiver of gr 0 j 2 are of the form z where is the separated quiver of j 2 for example in the case is the exterior algebra the separated quiver of j 2 is the quiver with two vertices and r 1 arrows from the first vertex to the second one there are the preprojective component y 0 j 2 y 2 y 1 y 3 and the preinjective component x 3 x 1 i x 2 x 0 k koszul algebras and sheaves 13 lemma 4 let be a koszul algebra and let f m n be a map in gr 0 then the induced map f m j 2 m n j 2 n is a monomorphism if f is a monomor phism and an epimorphism if f is an epimorphism proof the statement about epimorphisms is trivial assume f is a monomor phism so we have an exact sequence 0 m n c 0 it is easy to show that j im j in m for all i 0 the result follows from gm 1 proposition 8 let be a selfinjective koszul algebra m an indecomposable non projective koszul module and let 0 m f e g m 0 be the a r sequence in k ending at m where the maps are f f 1 f 2 fk and g g 1 g 2 gk t then i the induced sequence 0 m f e j 2 e g m j 2 m 0 is the a r sequence ending at m j 2 m in gr 0 j 2 ii the number of indecomposable summands of e equals the number of inde composable summands of e j 2 e iii the irreducible morphisms fi gi are monomorphisms epimorphisms if and only if the induced maps fi gi are monomorphisms epimorphisms proof i assume x m j 2 m is not a nonsplittable epimorphism in gr 0 j 2 using the equivalence mentioned earlier this map is induced by a homomorphism h y m in l that is not a splittable epimorphism since h can be lifted to e the result follows since the equivalence l gr 0 j 2 restricted to k implies the indecomposability of m j 2 m ii and iii follow immediately from our previous remarks as an immediate application of this result we see that if m is a koszul module of loewy length 2 then the a r sequence in k ending at mcoincides with the one in gr 0 j 2 let us assume now that m is an indecomposable non projective module in k then m j 2 m is again an indecomposable j 2 module so by analyzing the a r quiver of j 2 we see that m j 2 m either belong to the preprojective or preinjective components of gr 0 j 2 or is regular we show that one of this possibilities cannot exist lemma 5 let be an indecomposable selfinjective koszul algebra of loewy length r 1 and m an indecomposable non projective koszul module then m j 2 m can not lie in the preprojective component of gr 0 j 2 proof if it does it follows from the previous result that m is also in the preprojective component this component has two kinds of orbits one of them is the orbit of p j 2 p with p an indecomposable projective if m is in the orbit of p j 2 p then by induction p j 2 p is the of a koszul module therefore it must be a koszul but we know that if r 1 then p j 2 p is not koszul and we obtain a contradiction assume m is in the orbit of y 1 1 j 2 s with s a simple module generated in degree zero this implies by induction y 1 is koszul on the other hand it is easy to verify that over the module y 1 can not be a koszul module since this would imply that y 1 is simple and this is impossible we have enough to describe the shape of the auslander reiten quiver ofk where is selfinjective koszul using our previous results and the preceding remarks it is not hard to see that if m an indecomposable non projective koszul module 14 roberto marti nez villa then the cones of m in k and of m j 2 m in gr 0 j 2 are isomorphic via an iso morphism that takes monomorphisms into monomorphisms and epimorphisms into epimorphisms moreover since the modules soc 2 p i where p is an indecom posable projective injective and the simple s are koszul and the injective modules of j 2 are precisely the modules i the entire preinjective component of gr 0 j 2 consists of koszul modules thus the two kinds of orbits in this component are in fact orbits putting together these facts gives us the main result of this section theorem 13 let be an indecomposable selfinjective koszul algebra of loewy length r 1 with r 1 the a r quiver of k has connected components containing the indecomposable projective modules a component that coincides with the prein jective component of gr 0 j 2 and all the remaining connected components are full subquivers of a quiver of type za since the preinjective component ofk consists only of koszul modules of loewy length at most two it turns out that each non projective koszul module of loewy length three or higher lies in a regular component the following result yields examples of modules in the regular component of k lying at the mouths of these components see also gmrsz 3 2 and 3 6 proposition 9 let be as in the previous theorem let m be an indecomposable non projective koszul module and assume that m has no cogenerators in degree 1 let 0 m f e g m 0 be the auslander reiten sequence in k ending at m then the middle term e is indecomposable proof assume that e decomposes into k 1 indecomposable summands then f f 1 f 2 fk and g g 1 g 2 gk t it is clear that each composition gifi is nonzero on the other hand it was proved in gmrsz that m and therefore m too are cogenereted in degree 1 hence we obtain a contradiction to the fact that m has no cogenerators in degree 1 6 construction of locally free sheaves in this section we will prove that for an indecomposable noetherian artin shelter regular koszul algebra of global dimension r 1 the category of coherent sheaves qgr has relative right almost split sequences moreover we will prove that the category of locally free sheaves has relative right almost split sequences ar when we specialize to k x 0 x 1 xr with r 2 we will construct indecomposable vector bundles on pr of arbitrary large rank lemma 6 let be a noetherian artin shelter regular koszul algebra gr qgr the quotient functor and let m be module with m indecomposable in qgr then endqgr m is local proof let m be a graded torsion free module with m indecomposable we know there exists an integer k such that m k k n is koszul since n k m it follows n is indecomposable hence we may assume m is koszul up to shifting let l be a torsion free module we have homqgr m l 0 k 0 homgr j km l 0 koszul algebras and sheaves 15 to see this observe first that if k l then j lm jkm and the exact sequence 0 j lm jkm jkm j lm 0 induces an exact sequence homgr j km j lm l 0 homgr j km l 0 homgr j lm l 0 with homgr j km j lm l 0 0 it follows homgr j km l 0 homgr j lm l 0 and lim homgr j km l 0 k 0 homgr j km l 0 assume m is koszul and torsion free then endqgr m k 0 homgr j km m 0 let f homgr j km m 0 then imf j km set f to be the restriction of f to jkm let be the yoneda algebra of and let f k op k be the koszul duality we have natural isomorphisms hom op kf 1 m kf 1 m 0 hom j km jkm 0 hom op f 1 m f 1 m 0 hom m m 0 it follows end j km 0 is local and f is either nilpotent or invertible then f is either nilpotent or invertible proposition 10 let be an indecomposable noetherian artin shelter regular koszul algebra of global dimension r 1 with yoneda algebra let f k k op be the koszul duality then the category of non simple koszul op modules has right almost split sequences proof let m be an indecomposable non simple koszul op module then there exists a non projective koszul module n such that f n m let 0 n e n 0 be the almost split sequence in gr the module n is generated in degree r 1 and n r 1 is koszul it was proved in gmrsz jr 1 n is koszul 0 n 0 e 0 n 0 is an almost split sequence in k and n 0 j r 1 n is indecomposable applying koszul duality f we obtain an almost split sequence in k op 0 f n f e 0 f j r 1 n 0 let be a noetherian artin schelter regular koszul algebra and gr op qgr op the quotient functor denote by k op n the subcategory of qgr op defined as k op n m n m is a koszul op module it follows by proposition 5 the category qgr op is equal to n z k op n with this notation we have the following definition 6 an object m in qgr op has a relative right almost split sequence if given an integer n such that m k op n then there exist l n k op n and a short exact sequence 0 m l n 0 which is an almost split sequence in k op n theorem 14 let be an indecomposable noetherian artin shelter regular koszul algebra then the category of sheaves qgr op has relative right almost split se quences 16 roberto marti nez villa proof let m be an indecomposable object in qgr op and gr op qgr op be the quotient functor then there exists an indecomposable torsion free module m such that m m since for some integer k the truncated module m k k x is koszul and x k m hence x is indecomposable by proposition 10 there exists an almost split sequence in k op of the form 0 x i y p z 0 and an exact sequence 0 x k y k z k 0 the functor is exact p s 2 hence there exists an exact sequence 0 x k i y k p z k 0 assume there exits h y k x k such that h i 1 where h hom j ty k x k then the sequence 0 j tx k j ty k j tz k 0 splits it follows the sequence 0 tf 1 z k tf 1 y k tf 1 x k 0 splits then the sequence 0 f 1 z k f 1 y k f 1 x k 0 splits it follows 0 x k y k z k 0 splits we must prove the sequence is almost split in k op k let h w k z k be a non splittable map in k op k the map h belongs to hom j tw k z k then h j tw k j tz k does not split applying the functor f 1 we obtain the following exact diagram 0 tf 1 z k tf 1 y k tf 1 x k 0 tf 1 w k applying t to the diagram and using the fact 0 f 1 z k f 1 y k f 1 x k 0 is almost split in k k we obtain an exact diagram 0 f 1 z k f 1 y k f 1 x k 0 f 1 w k applying t to the diagram we obtain and extension of the map tf 1 z k tf 1 w k applying the functor f we obtain a lifting of the map h j tw k j tz k to g j tw k y k finally applying the functor to the diagram we obtain a lifting g w k y k of h as claimed we have proved 0 m i l p n 0 is a relative almost split sequence in qgr op corollary 4 let coh slpr be the category of coherent sheaves on projective space slpr then coh slpr has relative right almost split sequences koszul algebras and sheaves 17 let be an artin schelter regular koszul algebra l and m finitely generated koszul op module such that l n m m and assume n m then there exits an integer k such that l n k l n k n m m k mm k m or jn kl n k jm km m k applying the duality f 1 we obtain n kf 1 l n k m kf 1 m m k therefore n mf 1 l n m f 1 m applying f it follows jn ml n m m the following leemma will be needed in the next proposition lemma 7 let be an indecomposable graded selfinjective quiver algebra of loewy length r 1 then for any non negative integer k we have an isomorphism d k 0 r 1 k 0 proof let s be a graded simple generated in degree zero then by m 3 d s is also generated in degree zero let p be the projective cover of d s applying the functor hom to the exact sequence p d s 0 we obtain an exact sequence 0 d s p with p an indecomposable projective generated in degree zero of loewy length r 1 therefore d s r 1 is a simple module generated in degree zero the nakayama equivalence s d s r 1 induces a bijection of the graded simple modules generated in degree zero hence 0 d 0 r 1 applying d r 1 to the minimal projective resolution of 0 we obtain a minimal projective resolution of d 0 r 1 it follows d k 0 r 1 k 0 theorem 15 let be an indecomposable noetherian artin shelter regular koszul algebra of global dimension r 1 then the category of locally free sheaves of finite rank has relative right almost split sequences proof let be the yoneda algebra of and f k k op koszul duality let m qgr op be an indecomposable locally free sheaf we may assume m m where gr op qgr op is the quotient functor and m is an indecomposable module then there exists an indecomposable non projective koszul module x and some integer n with f x n m let 0 x e x 0 be the almost split sequence in gr and 0 jr 1 x e 0 x 0 the almost split sequence in k since f x is locally free ext j s 0 s x 0 0 for 0 j r and s 0 there is a chain of isomorphisms hom s j 0 s d x r 1 0 hom s j 0 d x r s 1 0 hom d s j 0 x r s 1 0 hom d s j 0 r 1 x s 0 hom s j 0 x s 0 hom s j 0 s x 0 0 for s 0 but x 2 d x hence x r 1 2 d x r 1 2 it follows by corollary 2 x r 1 is such that f x r 1 is locally free by proposition 5 jr 1 x is such that f jr 1 x is locally free and by proposition 4 f e 0 is locally free it follows 0 f x f e 0 f j r 1 x 0 is a rela tive almost split sequence of locally free sheaves hence 0 f x n f e 0 n f j r 1 x n 0 is relative almost split 18 roberto marti nez villa corollary 5 the category of vector bundles v pr on projective space pr has relative right almost split sequences let and be like in the theorem the almost split sequences in qgr op are related with the almost split sequences in gr j 2 using the results of section 3 we have the following version of the main theorem of section 3 theorem 16 let be an indecomposable noetherian artin schelter regular koszul algebra of global dimension r with r 2 with yoneda algebra let f k k op be the koszul duality and let m be an indecomposable koszul module then the relative auslander reiten component of f m is either contained in the nonegative part of a quiver of type z where is the separated quiver of j 2 or of the form fm if f m is locally free then all the sheaves in the diagram are locally free for all the modules m in the nonegative part of a quiver of type z where is the separated quiver of j 2 the sheaf f m is locally free as a corollary we have theorem 17 let k x 0 x 1 xr be the polynomial algebra with r 1 and k x 0 x 1 xr x 2 i xixj xjxi the exterior algebra let f k k op be the koszul duality and let m be an indecomposable koszul module then the relative auslander reiten component of f m is either contained in the non negative part of the quiver z where is the quiver with r 1 arrows or of the form fm if f m is locally free then all the sheaves in the diagram are locally free if m is contained in the non negative part of the quiver z where is the quiver with r 1 arrows then f m is locally free corollary 6 there are indecomposable vector bundles on pr with r 1 of arbitrary high rank proof if we have an exact sequence of vector bundles 0 x y z 0 it is clear that rk y rk x rk z where rk y dentes the rank of y letm be an indecomposable koszul

for any j 0 the following equality hold rk f jm 1 rk f j 1 m rk f jm assume for all j 0 there is an equality rk f jmi rk f jmi 1 rk f i jm we have the following commutative diagram f j 1 mi 1 f jmi f
