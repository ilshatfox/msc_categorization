chiral algebras as defined by a beilinson and v drin feld from the point of view of deformation theory first we define the notion of deformation of a chiral algebra on a smooth curve x over a bundle of local artinian commutative algebras on x equipped with a flat connection whereas usual algebraic structures are deformed over a local artinian algebra and we show that such deformations are controlled by a certain lie algebra g then we try to contemplate a possible additional structure on g and we conjecture that this structure up to homotopy is a chiral analogue of gerstenhaber al gebra i e a coisson algebra with odd coisson bracket in the terminology of beilinson drinfeld finally we discuss possible applications of this structure to the problem of quantization of coisson algebras 2000 mathematics subject classification 14 18 1 introduction chiral algebras were introduced in 1 in the same paper the authors intro duced the classical limit of a chiral algebra which they call a coisson algebra and posed the problem of quantization of coisson algebras the goal of this paper is to show how the theory of deformation quantization the theory of deformations of associative algebras of a certain type in the spirit of 3 can be developed in this situation central object in the theory of deformations of associative algebras is the differential graded lie algebra of hochschild cochains it turns out that in our situation it is more appropriate to use what we call pro lie algebras rather than usual lie algebras the notion of lie algebra was also introduced in 1 next we compute the cohomology of the pro lie algebra controlling chiral deformations of a free commutative dx algebra sk where k is a locally free dx module next we state an analogue of gerstenhaber theorem which says that the coho mology of the deformation complex of an associative algebra carries the structure of a gerstenhaber algebra we give a definition of a chiral analogue of gerstenhaber

operations of this structure on deformation pro lie algebra of a chiral algebra finally mimicking kontsevich s formality theorem we formulate the formality conjecture for the deformation pro lie algebra of the chiral algebra sk mentioned above and claim that this conjecture implies a 1 1 correspondence between defor mations of sk and coisson brackets on sk 2 chiral algebras and their deformations 2 1 chiral operations in 1 chiral operations are defined as follows let x be a smooth curve and mi n dx modules denote by in x x n the diagonal embedding and by jn un x n the open embedding of the complement to all diagonals in xn set pch m 1 mn n homdxn j j m 1 mn in n 1 in the case n 0 set pch m h 0 m dx ox let m be a fixed dx module write pchm n pch m m m m it is explained in 1 that pm is an operad 2 1 1 chiral algebras let lie be the operad of lie algebras a chiral algebra structure on m is a homomorphism lie pm we have a standard chiral algebra structure onm x a chiral algebra m is called unital if it is endowed with an injection x m of chiral algebras 2 2 deformations 2 2 1 agreements to simplify the exposition we will only consider unital chiral algebras m with the following restrictions we assume that x is affine and the dx module m can be represented as m x n where n e ox dx for some locally free coherent sheaf e 2 2 2 nilpotent dx algebras let e be a left dx module equipped with a commutative associative unital product e e e let u ox e be the unit embedding call e nilpotent if there exists a dx module splitting s e m ox and a positive integer n such that the n fold product vanishes on m m is then a unique maximal dx ideal in e deformations of chiral algebras 107 2 2 3 deformations over a nilpotent dx algebra let e be a nilpotent dx algebra with maximal ideal m we have a notion of e module and of an e linear chiral algebra for any dx module m me m ox e is an e module let m be a chiral algebra an e linear unital chiral algebra structure on me is called deformation of m over e if the induced structure on me m me m coincides with the one on m denote by gm e the set of all isomorphism classes of such deformations 2 3 the functor gm and its representability it is clear that e 7 gm e is a functor from the category of nilpotent dx algebras to the category of sets in classical deformation theory one usually has a functor from the category of usual local arminian nilpotent and finitely dimen sional algebras to the category of sets and one tries to represent it by a differential graded lie algebra in this section we will see that in our situation a natural sub stitute for a lie algebra is a so called lie algebra in the sense of 1 more precise given a lie algebra g we are going to construct a functor fg from the category of nilpotent dx algebras to the category of sets in the next section we will show that the functor gm is pro representable in this sense we will construct a pro lie algebra defm exact meaning will be given below and an isomorphism of functors gm and fdefm 2 3 1 lie algebras 1 let gi n be right dx modules set p g 1 gn n homdxn g 1 gn in n and p g n p g g g it is known that p g is an operad a lie algebra structure on g is by definition a morphism of operads f lie p g let b lie 2 be the element corresponding to the lie bracket we call f b p g 2 the lie bracket 2 3 2 let g be a lie algebra and a be a commutative dx algebra introduce a vector space g a g dx a this space is naturally a lie algebra indeed we have a lie bracket g g i 2 g multiply both parts by a a g g dx x a a i 2 g dx x a a the left hand side is isomorphic to g a g a the right hand side is isomorphic to g dx a ox a thus becomes g a g a g dx a ox a 108 dimitri tamarkin the product on a gives rise to a map g dx a ox a g dx a g a and we have a map g a g a g a it is straightforward to check that this map is a lie bracket 2 3 3 let now g be a differential graded lie algebra and let a be a differential graded commutative dx algebra then g a g dx a is a differential graded lie algebra 2 3 4 let a be a nilpotent dx algebra and ma a be the maximal nilpotent ideal then g ma is a nilpotent differential graded lie algebra 2 3 5 recall that given a differential graded nilpotent lie algebra n one can con struct the so called deligne groupoid gn its objects are all x n 1 satisfying dx x x 2 0 so called maurer cartan elements the group exp n 0 acts on the set of maurer cartan elements by gauge transformations gn is the groupoid of this action denote by dn the set of isomorphism classes of this groupoid if f n m is a map of differential graded lie algebras such that the induced map on cohomology hi f is an isomorphism for all i 0 then the induced map dn dm is a bijection if n m are both centered in non negative degrees then the induced map gn gm is an equivalence of categories since in our situation we will deal with lie algebras centered in arbitrary degrees we will use dn rather than groupoids 2 3 6 set fm a dg ma it is a functor from the category of nilpotent dx algebras to the category of sets 2 4 pro lie algebras lie algebras are insufficient for description of deformations of chiral algebras we will thus develop a generalization we need some preparation 2 4 1 procategory for an abelian category c consider the category pro c whose objects are functors i c where i is a small filtered category let fk ik c k 1 2 be objects set hom f 1 f 2 liminv i 2 i 2 limdir i 1 i 1 f 1 i 1 f 2 i 2 the composition of morphisms is naturally defined one can show that pro c is an abelian category objects of pro c are called pro objects deformations of chiral algebras 109 2 4 2 direct image of pro d modules let m i dy mod be a pro object where y is a smooth algebraic variety and let f y z be a locally closed embedding denote the composition f m i dz mod simply by f m we will get a functor f pro dy mod pro dz mod 2 4 3 chiral and operations forn mi pro dx modwe define p m 1 mn n pch m 1 mn n by exactly the same formulas as for usual dx modules 2 4 4 pro lie algebras lie algebra structure on a pro dx module is defined in the same way as for usual dx modules 2 4 5 for a pro right dx module i m and a left dx module l define a vector space m dx l liminv i m dx l for a lie algebra g and a commutative dx algebra a g dx a is a lie algebra construction is the same as for usual lie algebras similarly we can define the functor fg from the category of nilpotent dx algebras to the category of sets 2 5 representability of gm by a pro lie algebra we are going to construct a differential graded pro lie algebra g such that fg is equivalent to gm we need a couple of technical lemmas 2 5 1 let y be a smooth affine algebraic varieties and u v be right dy modules let u a be the family of all finitely generated submodules of u denote prohom u v liminv u v the corresponding pro vector space 2 5 2 let i x y be a closed embedding let b be a dy module and m be a dx module then prohomdy b i m ox dx is a pro dx module denote it by p b m let now y x n lemma 2 1 assume that b jn j n e oxn dxn where e is locally free and coherent for any left dx module l we have prohom b in m ox l p b m dx l 110 dimitri tamarkin proof let f jn j ne we have b f oxn dxn note that f limdir f where f runs through the set of all free coherent submodules of f we have p b m liminv homdxn f oxn dxn in m ox l liminv f oxn in m ox dx dx l liminv homoxn f in m ox dx dx l prohom b in m ox dx dx l 2 5 3 let b m be as above we have a natural morphism i in p b m p b m dx d n o x x prohom b m dx dx n o x the above lemmas imply that i is an isomorphism 2 5 4 let m be a right dx module set um n pch m m m m dx prohom jn j nm n in m dx it is a right pro dx module we will endow the collection um with the struc ture of an operad in pseudotensor category this means that we will define the composition maps i p um n um m um n m 1 i 1 n m 1 satisfying the operadic axioms we need a couple of technical facts 2 5 5 let in x x n be the diagonal embedding and pin x n x be the projections lemma 2 5 3 implies that lemma 2 2 in um k pch m m m dx d n x lemma 2 3 for any dx modules m s we have an isomorphism in m p i n s in m s deformations of chiral algebras 111 2 5 6 we are now ready to define the desired structure in virtue of 2 3 we have natural maps pch m 1 mn n pch m 1 mi dx mn n dx thus we have maps pch m 1 mn ni dx pch n 1 nm k dx pch m 1 mn ni dx pch n 1 ni dx nm k dx dx pch n 1 ni 1 m 1 mn ni 1 nm k dx dx i 2 pch n 1 ni 1 m 1 mn ni 1 nm k dx by substituting m instead of all ni mj k we get the desired insertion map i um n um m i 2 um n m 1 2 5 7 similarly we have insertion maps i um n pchm m um n m 1 and i pchm n um m um n m 1 2 5 8 let o be a differential graded operad set go n o n sn and go ngo n 1 n let pn o n go n be the natural projection which is the symmetrization map define the brace x y 7 x y go n go m go n m 1 as follows x y npn 1 x y 2 and the bracket x y x y 1 x y y x 3 we see that is a lie bracket thus go is a differential graded lie algebra for an operad o denote by o the shifted operad such that the structure of an o algebra on a complex v is equivalent to the structure of an o algebra on a complex v 1 thus o n o n n 1 n where n is the sign representation of sn let o be an operad of vector spaces the set of maurer cartan elements of go is in 1 1 correspondence with maps of operads lie o assume that o 1 is a nilpotent algebra xn 0 for any x o 1 let a be o 1 with adjoined unit and let a be the group of invertible elements a acts on o by automorphisms therefore a acts on the set of maps lie o the groupoid of this action is isomorphic to the deligne groupoid of go 112 dimitri tamarkin 2 5 9 similarly let a be a operad then formula 3 defines a lie algebra ga we have natural action of a usual pro lie algebra gp ch m on a pro lie algebra gum by derivations the chiral bracket b g 1 p ch m satisfies b b 0 therefore the bracket with b defines a differential on gum denote this differential graded lie algebra by dm 2 5 10 to avoid using derived functors we will slightly modify dm recall that m x n where n is free let pred ch m m m dx pch m m m dx be the subset of all operations vanishing under all restrictions pch m m m dx pch m m x m m m dx let defm dm be the submodule such that defm n p red ch m m m dx n sn 1 n we see that defm is a lie differential subalgebra of dm 2 5 11 proposition 2 4 the functors gm and fdefm are canonically isomorphic 2 6 example let k be a free left dx module let t ik k o xi the symmetric group si acts on the dx module t ik let sik t ik si be the submodule of invariants and sk i 0 s ik sk is naturally a free commutative dx algebra and hence skr sk x is a chiral algebra we will compute the cohomology of the dx module defskr let s 0 k n 1 s ik we have defskr n pch s 0 k r 1 s 0 k r 1 skr dx 1 sn on the other hand denote by sk k consider as an sk dx module of differentials of sk we have the de rham differential d s 0 k we have a through map cn pch k 1 r k 1 r sk 1 r sn p sk ch 1 r 1 r sk 1 r sn d pch s 0 k 1 r s 0 k 1 r sk 1 r sn where psk ch stands for sk linear chiral operations denote by the same letter the induced map cn pch k 1 r k 1 r sk 1 r sn defsk deformations of chiral algebras 113 proposition 2 5 1 dcn 0 2 cn induces an isomorphism pch k 1 r k 1 r sk 1 r sn hn 1 defsk 1 n 2 6 1 for a chiral algebra m denote by hm the graded lie algebra of cohomology of defm 2 6 2 assume that k is finitely generated let k hom k dx x 1 be the dual module then hskr n p k r kr skr dx n sn 1 n n nk ox sk r 1 n 2 6 3 we will postpone the calculation of the lie bracket on hskr until we show in the next section that hm has in fact a richer structure 3 algebraic structure on the cohomology of the deformation pro lie algebra we will keep the agreements and the notations from 2 2 1 3 1 cup product we will define a chiral operation pch defm 1 2 and then we will study the induced map on cohomology 3 1 1 recall that defm 1 n an sn where an pch n 1 n 1 m dx let in x x n be the diagonal embedding and let pi xn x un x n be the complement to the union of all pairwise diagonals pix pjx and jn un xn be the open embedding let un m x n m be the complement to the diagonals pix pjx where 1 i n n 1 j n m and jnm unm x n m be the embedding 114 dimitri tamarkin compute j 2 j 2 an am hom jn j n n 1 n jm j m n 1

obtain a chiral operation j 2 j 2 an am hom jn m j n m n 1 n m in m m dx dx i 2 an m which induces a chiral operation from pch a sn n a sm m a sn m n m and hence an opera tion pch defm 1 defm 1 defm 1 s 2 3 1 2 to investigate the properties of this operation consider the brace operation p defm defm defm defined by formula 2 let r pch a 1 a 2 a 3 p a 1 a 2 a 3 be the natural map proposition 3 1 d r let h be the induced operation on hm 1 the above proposition implies that r h 0 in virtue of exact sequence 0 hom a 1 l a 2 l a 3 l pch a 1 a 2 a 3 r p a 1 a 2 a 3 h defines a dx commutative product hm 1 hm 1 hm 1 denoted by the same letter 3 1 3 proposition 3 2 h is associative 3 1 4 leibnitz rule we are going to establish a relation between and this relation is similar to the one of coisson algebras our exposition will mimic the definition of coisson algebras from 1 deformations of chiral algebras 115 3 1 5 let ai be right dx modules write a 1 a 2 a l 1 a l 2 r p a 1 a 2 a 3 hom a 1 a 2

3 we have f e et in other words the cup product and the bracket satisfy the leibnitz identity 3 1 7 we see that hm has a pro lie bracket hm l 1 has a commutative dx algebra structure and these structures satisfy the leibnitz identity call this struc ture a c gerstenhaber algebra structure thus our findings can be summarized as follows theorem 3 4 the cohomology of the deformation pro lie algebra of a chiral algebra is naturally a pro c gerstenhaber algebra 3 2 example m sk r we come back to our example 2 6 for simplicity assume k is finitely gener ated free dx module we have seen in this case that hm l 1 i i k sk i s k 1 k proposition 3 5 the cup product on hm coincides with the natural one on the symmetric power algebra 116 dimitri tamarkin 3 2 1 to describe the bracket it suffices to define it on the submodule of generators g k 1 k r define p g g hm to be zero when restricted onto kr kr and k r 1 k r 1 restriction onto k k 1 takes values in x hm and is given by the canonic pairing from 1 k k r i 2 x recall the definition we have k r hom kr dx x for open u v x we have the composition map k u k v dx x u v i 2 x u v which defines the pairing this uniquely defines the lie bracket 4 formality conjecture following the logic of kontsevich s formality theorem one can formulate a formality conjecture in this situation 4 1 quasi isomorphisms a map f g h of differential graded pro lie algebras is called quasi isomorphism if it induces an isomorphism on cohomology call a pro lie algebra perfect if such is its underlying complex of pro vector spaces the morphism f is called perfect quasi isomorphism if it is a quasi isomorphism and both g and h are perfect two perfect pro lie algebras are called perfectly quasi isomorphic if there exists a chain of perfect quasi isomorphisms connecting g and h conjecture 4 1 defsk and hsk are perfectly quasi isomorphic the importance of this conjecture can be seen from the following theorem theorem 4 2 any chain of perfect quasi isomorphisms between defskr and hskr establishes a bijection between the set of isomorphism classes of a linear coisson brackets on skr a which vanish modulo the maximal ideal ma and the set of isomorphism classes of all deformations of the chiral algebra skr over a references 1 a beilinson v drinfeld chiral algebras 2 w goldman j millson deformations of flat bundles over ka hler
