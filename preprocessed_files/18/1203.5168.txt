bernstein and deligne to study the derived cat egories of perverse sheaves and nowadays become very powerful in understanding relationship among three algebraic geometric or topological objects the purpose of this series of papers is to study recolle ments in terms of derived module categories and homological ring epimorphisms and then to apply our results to both representation theory and algebraic k theory in this paper we present a new and systematic method to construct recollements of derived module categories for this aim we introduce a new ring structure called the noncommutative tensor product and give necessary and sufficient conditions for noncommutative localizations which appears often in representation theory topology and k theory to be homological the input of our machinery is an exact context which can be easily obtained from a rigid morphism that exists in very general circumstances the output is a recollement of derived module categories of rings in which the noncommutative tensor product of an exact context plays a crucial role thus we obtain a large variety of new recollements from commutative and noncommutative localizations ring epimorphisms and

first introduced by beilinson berstein and deligne in 1982 in order to describe the derived categories of perverse sheaves over singular spaces by using derived versions of grothendieck s six functors see 16 6 later recollements of derived categories were employed to study stratifications of the derived categories of modules over blocks of the bernstein gelfand gelfand category o see 14 further rec ollements were used by happel to establish a relationship among finitistic dimensions of finite dimensional algebras see 17 recently they become of great interest in understanding the derived categories of the endomorphism rings of infinitely generated tilting modules see 5 2 8 it turns out that recollements are corresponding author email xicc cnu edu cn fax 0086 10 68903637 2010

epimorphism 1 http arxiv org abs 1203 5168 v 3 actually a very useful framework for investigating relationships among three algebraic geometric or topo logical objects see 6 27 recollements of derived module categories have an intimate connection with homological ring epimor phisms 15 20 8 25 which play a crucial role in many branches of mathematics recall that a ring epimorphism r s is said to be homological if torri s s 0 for all i 0 in commutative algebra homo logical ring epimorphisms often appear as localizations which are one of the fundamental tools in algebraic geometry in representation theory homological ring epimorphisms have been used to study perpendicular categories sheaves and stratifications of derived module categories of rings see 15 14 8 and to construct infinitely generated tilting modules see 1 in algebraic k theory neeman and ranicki have employed homological noncommutative localizations a special class of homological ring epimorphisms to establish a useful long exact sequence of algebraic k groups see 23 which generalizes many earlier results in the literature see 22 also in banach algebra homological ring epimorphisms have been topologically modified to investigate the analytic functional calculus see 31 where they were called localizations in this paper we shall provide a systematic study of recollements of derived module categories through homological ring epimorphisms especially those arising from noncommutative localizations which have been used widely in topology and geometry see for instance 23 and 27 for this purpose we introduce the notion of exact contexts and define their noncommutative tensor products which not only generalise the usual tensor products over commutative rings but also cover some well known constructions in the literature coproducts of rings dual extensions and endomorphism rings under a tor vanishing condition we give a constructive method to produce new homological noncommutative localizations and recollements of derived categories of rings roughly speaking the input of our machinery is a quadruple consisting of two ring homomorphisms a bimodule and a special element of the bimodule such that they are linked by an exact sequence the output is a recollement of derived module categories of rings in which the noncommutative tensor products play an essential role as a consequence we apply our general results to ring epimorphisms commutative and noncommutative localizations and extensions and get a large class of new recollements of derived module categories this kind of recollements was already applied to study the jordan ho lder theorem for stratifications of derived module categories in 8 and will be used to investigate relationships among homological or k theoretical properties of three algebras see 9 10 now let us explain our results more explicitly first of all we introduce some notation let r s and t be associative rings with identity and let r s and r t be ring homomorphisms suppose that m is an s t bimodule together with an element m m we say that the quadruple m m is an exact context if the following sequence 0 r s t m m m 0 is an exact sequence of abelian groups where m and m denote the right and left multiplication by m maps respectively if m s r t and m 1 1 in an exact context m m then we simply say that the pair is exact exact contexts can be easily constructed from rigid morphisms in an additive category see section 3 below given an exact context m m we introduce in section 4 a new multiplication on the abelian group t r s so that t r s becomes an associative ring with identity and that the following two maps s t r s s 7 1 s for s s and t t r s t 7 t 1 for t t are ring homomorphisms see lemma 4 4 furthermore if both s and t are r algebras over a commutative ring r and if the pair is exact then this new ring structure on t r s coincides with the usual tensor product of the r algebras t and s over r due to this reason the new ring t r s is called the noncom mutative tensor product of the exact context m m and denoted by t r s in this paper note that if is an exact pair then the ring t r s together with and is actually the coproduct of the r rings s and t via the ring homomorphisms and over r and further if is a ring epimorphism then t r s is isomorphic to the endomorphism ring of the t module t r s see remark 5 2 2 let b s m 0 t c t r s t r s t r s t r s let m t r s be the unique r r bimodule homomorphism such that m and m see section 4 1 we define a ring homomorphism 0 b c first of all this ring homomorphism is of particular interest in representation theory the map can be regarded as the noncommutative localization of b at a homomorphism between finitely generated projective b modules and therefore it is a ring epimorphism with torb 1 c c 0 see section 5 1 and 29 and yields a fully faithful exact functor c mod b mod called the restriction functor between the category of all left c modules and the one of all left b modules moreover the map plays a fundamental role in stratifications of derived categories and in algebraic k theory see 8 23 27 generally speaking is not always homological in the sense of geigle and lenzing see 15 in 8 there is a sufficient condition for to be homological concisely if r s is an injective ring epimorphism with torr 1 s s 0 and if t is the endomorphism ring of the r module s r with r t the ring homomorphism defined by r 7 x 7 xr for r r and x s r then b is isomorphic to the endomorphism ring of the r module s s r for to be homological we assume in 8 that rs has projective dimension at most 1 in general context it seems not much to be known about the map being homological so the following general questions arise questions let m m be an exact context 1 when is b c homological or equivalently when is the derived functor d d c d b fully faithful 2 if is homological is the verdier quotient of d b by d c equivalent to the derived module category of a ring or does d b admit a recollement of derived module categories of rings r and c the present paper will provide necessary and sufficient conditions to these questions here we will assume neither that is injective nor that rs has projective dimension at most 1 nor that is homological compare with 1 8 furthermore we allow some flexibilities for the choice of the ring homomorphism r t and the bimodule m our main result in this paper can be formulated as follows theorem 1 1 let m m be an exact context then 1 the following assertions are equivalent a the ring homomorphism b c is homological b torri t s 0 for all i 1 moreover if the pair is exact and is homological then each of the above is equivalent to c the ring homomorphism t t r s is homological 2 if one of the above assertions in 1 holds then there exists a recollement among the derived module categories of rings d t r s d b gg ww d r ff xx if in addition the projective dimensions of rs and tr are finite then the above recollement can be restricted to a recollement of bounded derived module categories d b t r s d b b hh vv d b r gg vv 3 note that d b is always a recollement of d t and d s in which the derived category d r of the given ring r is missing however theorem 1 1 provides us with a different recollement for d b a remarkable feature of this recollemnt is that it contains d r as a member and thus provides a way to understand properties of the ring r through those of the rings closely related to s and t this idea will be discussed in detail in the forthcoming papers 9 10 of this series the homological condition b in theorem 1 1 can be satisfied in many cases for instance in commuta tive algebra we may take r s to be a localization and in non commutative case we refer to the general examples in section 4 2 a realization of theorem 1 1 occurs in noncommutative localizations which have played an important role in topology see 27 given a ring homomorphism r s we may consider as a complex q of left r modules with r and s in degrees 1 and 0 respectively then there is a distinguished triangle r s q r 1 in the homotopy category k r of the category of all r modules this triangle induces a canonical ring homomorphism from r to the endomorphism ring of q in k r and therefore yields a ring homomorphism from r to the endomorphism ring of q in d r which depends on see section 5 2 for details let s endd r q observe that if is injective then q can be identified in d r with the r module s r and consequently the map r s coincides with the induced map r endr s r by the right multiplication further let endd r s q and let be the following induced map homd r s q homd r s q s homd r s q q which is a homomorphism of finitely generated projective modules let stand for the noncommutative localization of at universal localization in terminology of cohn and schofield 13 29 if is a ring epimorphism such that homr s ker 0 then we show in section 5 2 that the pair is exact so applying theorem 1 1 to we get the following corollary corollary 1 2 if r s is a homological ring epimorphism such that homr s ker 0 then the following assertions are equivalent 1 the noncommutative localization of at is homological 2 the ring homomorphism s s r s is homological 3 torri s s 0 for any i 1 in particular if one of the above assertions holds then there exists a recollement of derived module categories d ends s r s d ii uu d r ff xx as an application of corollary 1 2 we obtain the following result which not only generalizes the first statement of 8 corollary 6 6 1 since we do not require that the ring epimorphism is injective but also gives a way to get derived equivalences of rings see 28 for definition corollary 1 3 let r s be a homological ring epimorphism such that homr s ker 0 then we have the following 1 if rs has projective dimension at most 1 then is homological 2 the ring is zero if and only if there is an exact sequence 0 p 1 p 0 rs 0 of r modules such that pi is finitely generated and projective for i 0 1 in this case the rings r and are derived equivalent as another application of corollary 1 2 we have the following result in which we do not impose any restriction on the projective dimension of rs 4 corollary 1 4 suppose that r s is an extension of rings that is r is a subring of the ring s with the same identity let s be the endomorphism ring of the r module s r and b s homr s s r 0 s 1 if the left r module s is flat then there exists a recollement of derived module categories d s r s d b gg ww d r ff xx where s r s is the noncommutative tensor product of an exact context 2 if s is commutative and the inclusion r s is homological then the ring s is commutative and there exists a recollement of derived module categories d s r s d b gg ww d r ff xx where s r s is the usual tensor product of r algebras let us remark that in commutative algebra there is a lot of ring extensions satisfying the homological assumption of corollary 1 4 2 for example if r is a commutative ring and is a multiplicative subset of r that is 0 6 and st whenever s t then the ordinary localization r 1 r of r at is always homological further if f r r is a homomorphism from the ring r to another commutative ring r then the image of a multiplicative subset of r under f is again a multiplicative set in r so as a consequence of corollary 1 4 2 we obtain the following result which may be of its own interest in commutative algebra corollary 1 5 suppose that r is a commutative ring with a multiplicative subset of r let s be the localization 1 r of r at with r s the canonical ring homomorphism if the map is injective for example if r is an integral domain then there exists a recollement of derived module categories d 1 s d endr s s r ii tt d r ii uu where s endr s r and is the image of under the induced map r s given by the right multipli cation observe that the recollements in corollaries 1 4 and 1 5 occur in the study of infinitely generated tilting modules see 1 and 8 the contents of this paper are outlined as follows in section 2 we fix notation and recall some defini tions and basic facts which will be used throughout the paper in particular we shall recall the definitions of noncommutative localizations coproducts of rings and recollements and prepare several lemmas for our proofs in section 3 we introduce the notion of exact contexts to construct exact contexts we introduce rigid morphisms or hypercyclic bimodules and show that rigid morphisms exist almost everywhere in rep resentation theory for example all kinds of approximations are rigid morphisms thus exact contexts exist rather abundantly in section 4 we define the so called noncommutative tensor products of exact contexts which will characterize the left parts of recollements constructed in section 5 also we provide examples to demonstrate that noncommutative tensor products cover many well known constructions in noncommutative algebra in section 5 we prove theorem 1 1 and all of its corollaries mentioned in section 1 finally in section 6 we give several examples to explain the necessity of some assumptions in our results in the second paper 9 of this series we shall consider the algebraic k theory of recollements and establish a long mayer vietoris sequence of higher algebraic k groups for homological milnor squares in the third paper 10 we shall study relationships among finitistic dimensions of three algebras involved in a recollement this will extend an earlier result of happel and a recent result by xu 5 2 preliminaries in this section we shall recall some definitions notation and basic results which are closely related to our proofs 2 1 notation and basic facts on derived categories let c be an additive category throughout the paper a full subcategory b of c is always assumed to be closed under isomorphisms that is if x b and y c with y x then y b given two morphisms f x y and g y z in c we denote the composite of f and g by f g which is a morphism from x to z the induced morphisms homc z f homc z x homc z y and homc f z homc y z homc x z are denoted by f and f respectively we denote the composition of a functor f c d between categories c and d with a functor g d e between categories d and e by gf which is a functor from c to e the kernel and the image of the functor f are denoted by ker f and im f respectively let y be a full subcategory of c by ker homc y we denote the full subcategory of c which is left orthogonal to y that is the full subcategory of c consisting of the objects x such that homc x y 0 for all objects y in y similarly ker homc y stands for the right orthogonal subcategory in c with respect to y let c c be the category of all complexes over c with chain maps and k c the homotopy category of c c when c is abelian the derived category of c is denoted by d c which is the localization of k c at all quasi isomorphisms it is well known that both k c and d c are triangulated categories for a triangulated category its shift functor is denoted by 1 universally if t is a triangulated category with small coproducts that is coproducts indexed over sets exist in t then for each object u in t we denote by tria u the smallest full triangulated subcategory of t containing u and being closed under small coproducts we mention the following properties related to tria u let f t t be a triangle functor of triangulated categories and let y be a full subcategory of t we define f 1 y x t f x y then 1 if y is a triangulated subcategory then f 1 y is a full triangulated subcategory of t 2 suppose that t and t admit small coproducts and that f commutes with coproducts if y is closed under small coproducts in t then f 1 y is closed under small coproducts in t in particular for an object u t we have f tria u tria f u in this paper all rings considered are assumed to be associative and with identity and all ring homomor phisms preserve identity unless stated otherwise all modules are referred to left modules let r be a ring we denote by r mod the category of all unitary left r modules by our convention of the composite of two morphisms if f m n is a homomorphism of r modules then the image of x m under f is denoted by x f instead of f x the endomorphism ring of the r module m is denoted by endr m as usual we shall simply write c r k r and d r for c r mod k r mod and d r mod respectively and identify r mod with the subcategory of d r consisting of all stalk complexes concentrated in degree zero further we denote by db r the full subcategory of d r consisting of all complexes which are isomorphic in d r to bounded complexes of r modules let x dx and y dy be two chain complexes over r mod the mapping cone of a chain map h x y is usually denoted by con h in particular we have a triangle x h y con h x 1 in k r called a distinguished triangle for each n z we denote by hn d r r mod the n th cohomology functor certainly this functor is naturally isomorphic to the hom functor homd r r n the hom complex hom r x y of x and y is defined to be the complex homnr x y d nx y n z with homnr x y p z homr x p y p n 6 and the differential d nx y of degree n given by f p p z 7 f pd p n y 1 nd p x f p 1 p z for f p p z hom n r x y for example if x r mod then we have hom r x y homr x y n homr x d n y n z if y r mod then hom r x y homr x n y 1 n 1 homr d n 1 x y n z for simplicity we denote hom r x y and hom r x y by homr x y and homr x y respectively note that homr x y is also isomorphic to the complex homr x n y homr d n 1 x y n z moreover it is known that hn hom r x y homk r x y n for any n z let z be a chain complex over rop mod then the tensor complex z r x of z and x over r is defined to be the complex z nrx nz x n z with z nrx p z z p r x n p and the differential z x of degree n given by z x 7 z dpz x 1 pz x dn px for z z p and x xn p for instance if x r mod then z r x zn r x d n z 1 n z in this case we denote z r x simply by z r x the following result establishes a relationship between hom complexes and tensor complexes let s be an arbitrary ring suppose that x xn dnx is a bounded complex of r s bimodules if rx n is finitely generated and projective for all n z then there is a natural isomorphism of functors homr x r r hom r x c r c s to prove this we note that for any r s bimodule x and any r module y there is a homomorphism of s modules x y homr x r r y homr x y defined by f y 7 x 7 x f y for f homr x r y y and x x which is natural in both x and y moreover the map x y is an isomorphism if rx is finitely generated and projective for any y c r and any n z it is clear that homr x r nry p z homr x p r r y n p and homnr x y p z homr x p y p n since x is a bounded complex now we define nx y p z 1 p n p x p y n p which is a homo morphism of s modules from homr x r nry to homnr x y then one can check that x y nx y n z is a chain map from homr x r ry to hom r x y since rx p is finitely generated and projective for each p z the map x p y n p is an isomorphism and so is the map nx y this implies that x y homr x r r y hom r x y is an isomorphism in c s since the homomorphism x y is natural in the variables x and y it can be checked directly that x homr x r r hom r x defines a natural isomorphism of functors from c r to c s 7 in the following we shall recall some definitions and basic facts about derived functors defined on derived module categories for details and proofs we refer to 7 19 let k r p respectively k r i be the smallest full triangulated subcategory of k r which i contains all the bounded above respectively bounded below complexes of projective respectively injective r modules and ii is closed under arbitrary direct sums respectively direct products note that k r p is contained in k r proj where r proj is the full subcategory of r mod consisting of all projective r modules moreover the composition functors k r p k r d r and k r i k r d r are equivalences of triangulated categories this means that for each complex x in d r there exists a complex px k r p together with a quasi isomorphism px x as well as a complex ix k r i together with a quasi isomorphism x ix in this sense we shall simply call px the projective resolution of x in k r for example if x is an r module then we can choose px to be a deleted projective resolution of rx furthermore if either x k r p or y k r i then homk r x y homd r x y and this isomorphism is induced by the canonical localization functor from k r to d r for any triangle functor h k r k s there is a total left derived functor lh d r d s defined by x 7 h px a total right derived functor rh d r d s defined by x 7 h ix observe that if h preserves acyclicity that is h x is acyclic whenever x is acyclic then h induces a triangle functor d h d r d s defined by x 7 h x in this case we have lh rh d h up to natural isomorphism and d h is then called the derived functor of h let m be a complex of r s bimodules then the functors m s k s k r and hom r m k r k s form a pair of adjoint triangle functors denote by m ls the total left derived functor of m s and by rhomr m the total right derived functor of hom r m it is clear that m ls rhomr m is an adjoint pair of triangle functors further the corresponding counit adjunction m ls rhomr m idd r is given by the composite of the following canonical morphisms in d r m ls rhomr m x m ls hom r m ix m s p hom r m ix m s hom r m ix ix x similarly we have a corresponding unit adjunction idd s rhomr m m ls which is given by the following composites for y d s y py hom r m m s py hom r m i m s py rhomr m m s py rhomr m m ls y for x d r and n z we have hn rhomr m x hn hom r m ix homk r m ix n homd r m ix n homd r m x n let t be another ring and n a complex of s t bimodules if sn k s p then m ls n lt m ls n lt m s n lt d t d r in fact since sn k s p by assumption we have n t pw k s p for w d t it follows that m ls n lt w m ls n t pw m s n t pw m s n t pw m s n lt w m ls n lt w 2 2 homological ring epimorphisms and recollements let r s be a homomorphism of rings 8 we denote by s mod r mod the restriction functor induced by and by d d s d r the derived functor of the exact functor we say that is a ring epimorphism if the restriction functor s mod r mod is fully faithful it is proved that is a ring epimorphism if and only if the multiplication map s r s s is an isomorphism as s s bimodules if and only if for any two homomorphisms f 1 f 2 s t of rings the equality f 1 f 2 implies that f 1 f 2 this means that for a ring epimorphism we have x s y x r y and homs y z homr y z for all right s modules x and for all s modules y and z note that for a ring epimorphism r s if r is commutative then so is s following 15 a ring epimorphism r s is called homological if torri s s 0 for all i 0 note that a ring epimorphism is homological if and only if the derived functor d d s d r is fully faithful this is also equivalent to saying that induces an isomorphism s lr s s in d s moreover for a homological ring epimorphism we have torri x y tor s i x y and ext i s y z ext i r y z for all i 0 and all right s modules x and for all s modules y and z see 15 theorem 4 4 clearly if r s is a ring epimorphism such that either rs or sr is flat then is homological in particular if r is commutative and is a multiplicative subset of r then the canonical ring homomorphism r 1 r is homological where 1 r stands for the ordinary localization of r at as a generalization of localizations of commutative rings noncommutative universal in cohen s ter minology localizations of arbitrary rings were introduced in 13 see also 29 and provide a class of ring epimorphisms with vanishing homology for the first degree now we mention the following basic fact on noncommutative localizations lemma 2 1 see 13 29 let r be a ring and let be a set of homomorphisms between finitely generated projective r modules then there is a ring r and a homomorphism r r of rings such that 1 is inverting that is if p q belongs to then r r r r p r r q is an isomorphism of r modules and 2 is universal inverting that is if s is a ring such that there exists a inverting homomorphism r s then there exists a unique homomorphism r s of rings such that 3 r r is a ring epimorphism with torr 1 r r 0 following 23 the r r in lemma 2 1 is called the noncommutative localization of r at one should be aware that r may not be flat as a right or left r module even worse the map in general is not homological see 24 thus it is a fundamental question when is homological next we recall the definition of coproducts of rings defined by cohn in 12 and point out that noncom mutative localizations are preserved by taking coproducts of rings let r 0 be a ring an r 0 ring is a ring r together with a ring homomorphism r r 0 r an r 0 homomorphism from an r 0 ring r to another r 0 ring s is a ring homomorphism f r s such that s r f then we can form the category of r 0 rings with r 0 rings as objects and with r 0 morphisms as morphisms clearly epimorphisms of this category are exactly ring epimorphisms starting from r 0 the coproduct of a family ri i i of r 0 rings with i an index set is defined to be an r 0 ring r together with a family i ri r i i of r 0 homomorphisms such that for any r 0 ring s with a family of r 0 homomorphisms i ri s i i there exists a unique r 0 homomorphism r s such that i i for all i i it is well known that the coproduct of a family ri i i of r 0 rings always exists we denote this coproduct by r 0 ri note that if i 1 2 then r 1 r 0 r 2 is the push out in the category of r 0 rings this implies that if r 1 r 0 r 1 is a ring epimorphism then so is the homomorphism 2 r 2 r 1 r 0 r 2 moreover r 0 r 0 r 1 r 1 r 1 r 0 r 0 for every r 0 ring r 1 where r 0 r 0 r 0 is the identity in general the coproduct of two r 0 algebras may not be isomorphic to their tensor product over r 0 for example given a field k the coproduct over k of the polynomial rings k x and k y is the free ring k x y in two variables x and y while the tensor product over k of k x and k y is the polynomial ring k x y the following result is taken from 8 lemma 6 2 and will be used later 9 lemma 2 2 let r 0 be a ring a set of homomorphisms between finitely generated projective r 0 modules and r 0 r 1 r 0 the noncommutative localization of r 0 at then for any r 0 ring r 2 the coproduct r 1 r 0 r 2 is isomorphic to the noncommutative localization r 2 of r 2 at the set r 2 r 0 f f finally we recall the notion of recollements of triangulated categories which was first defined in 6 to study exact sequences of derived categories of coherent sheaves over geometric objects definition 2 3 let d d and d be triangulated categories we say that d is a recollement of d and d if there are six triangle functors among the three categories d i i d j j i i d j j such that 1 i i i i j j and j j are adjoint pairs 2 i j and j are fully faithful functors 3 i j 0 and thus also j i 0 and i j 0 and 4 for each object x d there are two triangles in d i i x x j j x i i x 1 j j x x i i x j j x 1 clearly it follows from definition that for any objects x d and y d we have homd j x i y 0 homd i y j x a typical example of recollements of derived module categories is given by triangular matrix rings suppose that a and b are rings and that n is an a b bimodule let r a n 0 b be the triangular matrix ring associated with a b and n then there is a recollement of derived module categories d a d r ff xx d b ff xx in this case the six triangle functors in definition 2 3 can be described explicitly let e 0 0 0 1 r then we have j re l b j er lr j rhomb er i a lr i a l a i rhomr a where a is identified with r rer note that the canonical surjection r r rer is always a homological ring epimorphism as a further generalization of the above situation it was shown in 25 section 4 that for an arbitrary homological ring epimorphism r s there is a recollement of triangulated categories d s d r ff xx tria q gg ww where q is given by the distinguished triangle r s q r 1 in d r in this case the functor j is the canonical embedding and j q 1 lr i s lr i s l s i rhomr rs moreover we have d s ker homd r tria q x d r homd r y x 0 for all y tria q this clearly implies that homd r q x n 0 for all x c s and n z 10 3 definitions of rigid morphisms and exact contexts in this section we introduce the notion of rigid morphisms in an additive category which occur almost everywhere in the representation theory of algebras and which will be used to construct exact contexts let c be an additive category an object x in c c is rigid if homk c x x 1 0 definition 3 1 a morphism f y x in c c is said to be rigid if the object z in a distinguished triangle y f x z y 1 is rigid or equivalently the mapping cone con f of f is rigid in c c a morphism f y x in c is said to be rigid if f considered as a morphism from the stalk complex y to the stalk complex x is rigid or equivalently the complex con f 0 y f x 0 is rigid in c c note that the rigidity of a morphism f does not depend on the choice of the triangle which extends f if we consider a rigid morphism f in c as a two term complex over c then f is positively self orthogonal in k c that is homk c f f n 0 for all n 0 clearly a morphism f y x in c is rigid if and only if homc y x endc y f f endc x thus the zero map y x is rigid if and only if homc y x 0 and any isomorphism y x is always rigid let us give some non trivial examples of rigid morphisms which show that rigid morphisms exist in very general circumstances i for an additive category c if f y x is a morphism in c such that the induced map homc y f homc y y homc y x respectively homc f x homc x x homc y x is surjective then homc y x endc y f respectively homc y x f endc x and therefore f is rigid thus all ap proximations in the sense of auslander smalo see 4 are rigid morphisms this type of rigid morphisms includes the following three cases a let a be an artin algebra and let 0 z f y g x 0 be an almost split sequence in a mod then both f and g are rigid since both homa y g and homa f y are surjective for the definition of almost split sequences we refer the reader to 3 b the covariant morphisms defined in 11 are rigid recall that a morphism f y x in an additive category c is called covariant if the induced map homc x f homc x y homc x x is injective and the induced map homc y f homc y y homc y x is a split epimorphism of endc y modules c let s be a ring with identity if y is a quasi projective s module that is for any surjective homomor phism y x the induced map homs y y homs y x is surjective then we may take a submodule z of y and consider the canonical map f y x y z clearly we have homs y x ends y f and therefore f is rigid dually if x is a quasi injective s module that is for any injective homomorphism g y x the induced map homs x x homs y x is surjective then for any submodule y of x we have homs y x end x where is the inclusion of y into x this means that is rigid in par ticular every surjective homomorphism from a projective module to a module is rigid and every injective homomorphism from a module to an injective module is rigid ii let r s be an extension of rings that is r is a subring of the ring s with the same identity then the canonical map s s r of r modules is rigid in fact for any f homr s s r we choose an element s s such that s 1 f and denote by s s s the right multiplication by s map then the map f s sends 1 s to zero thus there exists a unique homomorphism g endr s r such that f s g this implies that homr s s r ends s endr s r since ends s endr s we have homr s s r endr s endr s r thus the map is rigid we should observe that not every nonzero homomorphism is rigid for example the right multiplication by x map k x x 2 k x x 2 is not rigid in k x x 2 mod where k is a field and x x x 2 is the coset of x in k x in general an element x in the radical of an artin algebra a considered as the right multiplication by x map from aa to itself is never rigid 11 motivated by the rigid morphisms we introduce the notion of the so called hypercyclic bimodules let s and t be two rings with identity and let m be an s t bimodule an element m m is called a hypergenerator if m sm mt in this case m is said to be hypercyclic hypercyclic bimodules and rigid morphisms are intimately related in the following way if f y x is a rigid morphism in an additive category c then f is a hypergenerator of the endc y endc x bimodule homc y x if m is hypercyclic with m a hypergenerator then we may define a map s t m s t 7 sm mt for s s and t t and get an exact sequence of ableian groups 0 k s t m 0 where k s t s t sm mt is a subring of the ring s t let p and q be the canonical projections from k to s and t respectively then s and t can be considered as k k bimodules and therefore the above sequence is actually an exact sequence of k k bimodules thus for each rigid morphism f y x there is an exact sequence 0 r p q endc y endc x f f homc y x 0 of r r bimodules where r s t endc y endc x s f f t is a subring of the ring endc y endc x now we give the definition of exact contexts definition 3 2 let r s and t be rings with identity let r s and r t be ring homomorphisms and let m be an s t bimodule with m m the quadruple m m is called an exact context if 0 r s t m m m 0 is an exact sequence of abelian groups where m and m stand for the right and left multiplication by m maps respectively in this case we also say that m m is an exact complement of if s r t 1 1 is an exact context then we say simply that is an exact pair note that the sequence is exact in the category of abelian groups if and only if e 1 the s t bimodule m is hypercyclic with m as a hypergenerator and e 2 the ring homomorphism r s t induces a ring isomorphism from r to k note that the quadruple m m is an exact context if and only if the following diagram r s m t m m is both a push out and a pull back in the category of r r bimodules let m m be an exact context then from we see that for an s t bimodule n with an element n n the pair n n is an exact complement of if and only if there exists a unique isomorphism m n of r r bimodules such that sm sn and mt nt for all s s and t t clearly preserves hypergenerators that is m n in general has not to be an isomorphism of s t bimodules that is m and n may not be isomorphic as s t bimodules see the examples in subsection 4 2 1 next we mention several examples of exact contexts 12 1 let m be a hypercyclic s t bimodule with m a hypergenerator then the pair p q of ring homo morphisms p k s and q k t together with m m forms an exact context so rigid morphisms always provide us with a class of exact contexts conversely every exact context appears in this form in fact for a given exact context m m we may define b s m 0 t and consider the canonical map from the first column to the second column of b defined by m it is easy to see that this is rigid and the induced exact context is precisely the given one so rigid morphisms describe exact contexts 2 suppose that r s is an extension of rings let r s be the inclusion with s s r the canonical surjection define s endr s r and r s r 7 x 7 xr for r r and x s r then homr s s r is an s s bimodule and the quadruple homr s s r is an exact context since the following diagram 0 r s s r 0 0 s homr s s r homr r s r 0 is commutative and the sequence of r r bimodules 0 r s s homr s s r 0 is exact in general the exact context presented here is different from the one induced from the rigid mor phism and the pair may not be exact because either s endr s as rings or s r s homr s s r as s s bimodules may fail a more general construction of exact contexts from a not necessarily injective ring homomorphism will be discussed in lemma 5 9 3 milnor squares defined by milnor in 21 sections 2 and 3 also provide a class of exact contexts recall that a milnor square is a commutative diagram of ring homomorphisms i 2 i 1 1 j 1 2 j 2 satisfying the following two conditions m 1 the ring is the pull back of 1 and 2 over that is given a pair 1 2 1 2 with 1 j 1 2 j 2 there is one and only one element such that i 1 1 and i 2 2 m 2 at least one of the two homomorphisms j 1 and j 2 is surjective clearly can be regarded as an 1 2 bimodule via the ring homomorphisms j 1 and j 2 let 1 be the identity of then j 1 and j 2 are exactly the multiplication maps 1 and 1 respectively now we claim that the pair i 1 i 2 together with 1 forms an exact context indeed it follows from the condition m 2 that is hypercyclic with 1 as a hypergenerator with the help of the condition m 1 the following sequence 0 i 1 i 2 1 2 j 1 j 2 0 is an exact sequence of bimodules this verifies the claim even more the pair i 1 i 2 is exact without loss of generality assume that j 2 is surjective then by m 1 the map i 1 is also surjective and i 2 induces an isomorphism ker i 1 ker j 2 of bimodules now 13 we can check that the map 1 2 defined by 1 2 7 1 j 1 2 j 2 for 1 1 and 2 2 is an isomorphism of 1 2 bimodules actually this follows from the following isomorphisms 1 2 ker i 1 2 2 ker i 1 2 2 ker j 2 2 similarly we can check that the pair i 2 i 1 is also exact with 2 1 as 2 1 bimodules 4 noncommutative tensor products of exact contexts in this section we shall define a new ring for each exact context this is the so called noncommutative tensor product which includes the notion of coproducts of rings usual tensor products and so on these noncom mutative tensor products can be constructed from both morita context rings and strictly pure extensions and will play a crucial role in construction of recollements of derived module categories in the next section 4 1 definition of noncommutative tensor products from now on let r s and r t be two arbitrary but fixed ring homomorphisms unless stated otherwise we always assume that m m is an exact context first we characterize when the pair in the exact context is exact recall that we have the following exact sequence of r r bimodules 0 r s t m m m 0 according to there exist two unique homomorphisms m s r t x 7 sx 1 1 tx and m t r s x 7 1 sx tx 1 where x m and sx tx s t with x sxm mtx such that the following two diagrams r s t m m m r s t s r t and r s t m m m r s t t r s are commutative where r t t s r t t 7 1 t and s r s s r t s 7 s 1 s s t r s s 7 1 s and t t t r s t 7 t 1 for s s and t t note that x and x are independent of different choices of sx tx in s t further let s r t m s t 7 smt clearly and are homomorphisms of r r bimodules is a homomorphism of s t bimodules and idm in particular is injective and is surjective lemma 4 1 the following statements are equivalent 1 the pair is an exact pair 2 the map is an isomorphism 3 coker r coker 0 4 m mt r m sm 0 14 proof note that is a homomorphism of s t bimodules and s 1 1 s 1 sm and 1 1 t 1 t mt for s s and t t this implies that the following diagram r s t s r t 0 r s t m m m 0 is commutative where the second row is assumed to be exact consequently 1 and 2 are equivalent according to we know that coker m mt and coker m sm as r r bimodules thus 3 and 4 are equivalent now we verify the equivalences of 2 and 3 in fact since idm the map is an isomorphism if and only if is a surjection while the latter is equivalent to that the map s t s r t is a surjection by therefore it is enough to show that is surjective if and only if coker r coker 0 to check this condition we consider the following two complexes con 0 r s 0 and con 0 r t 0 of r r bimodules where both s and t are of degree 0 and calculate the tensor complex of them over r con r con 0 r r r r r s r r r r t s t s r t 0 where r r r is of degree 2 if we identify r r r s r r and r r t with r s and t respectively then con r con is precisely the complex 0 r s t s r t 0 which is isomorphic to the following complex 0 r s t s r t 0 it follows that is surjective if and only if h 0 con r con 0 since h 0 con r con h 0 con r h 0 con coker r coker the map is surjective if and only if coker r coker 0 thus is an isomorphism if and only if coker r coker 0 this shows the equivalences of 2 and 3 remark 4 2 by the equivalences of 1 and 2 in lemma 4 1 if the pair is exact then it admits a unique complement s r t 1 1 up to isomorphism preserving hypergenerators of s t bimodules a sufficient condition to guarantee the isomorphism of is the following result corollary 4 3 if either r s or r t is a ring epimorphism then s r t m s t 7 smt is an isomorphism of s t bimodules 15 proof suppose that is a ring epimorphism then for any s module x the map x r r x s r x is an isomorphism this implies that coker r x 0 since coker m sm as r modules by and since m sm is an s module we have coker r coker coker r m sm 0 by lemma 4 1 the map is an isomorphism similarly if is a ring epimorphism then is an isomorphism as examples of exact pairs we see from corollary 4 3 that the rigid morphisms from an almost split sequence always provide us with exact pairs next we shall introduce the so called noncommutative tensor products t r s of the exact context m m that is we endow t r s with an associative multiplication t r s t r s t r s under which it becomes an associative ring with the identity 1 1 let s r t t r s s t 7 1 ssmt tsmt 1 for s s and t t where the pair ssmt tsmt s t is chosen such that smt ssmtm mtsmt then is a homomorphism of r r bimodules such that s 1 1 s and 1 t t 1 the multiplication is induced by the following homomorphisms t r s r t r s t r s r t r s t s t r t r s r s t r t r s r s t s t r s where t t r t t and s s r s s are the multiplication maps more precisely for ti si t r s with i 1 2 we have t 1 s 1 t 2 s 2 t 1 s 1 t 2 s 2 t 1 1 ss 1 mt 2 ts 1 mt 2 1 s 2 the following lemma reveals a crucial property of this multiplication lemma 4 4 the following statements are true 1 with the multiplication the abelian group t r s becomes an associative ring with the identity 1 1 2 the maps s t r s and t t r s are ring homomorphisms in particular t r s can be regarded as an s t bimodule via and 3 the map m t r s is a homomorphism of s t bimodules such that m 1 1 proof 1 it suffices to show that the multiplication is associative and that 1 1 is the identity of t r s to check the associativity of we take elements ti t and si s for 1 i 3 and choose two pairs x y and u v in s t such that s 1 mt 2 xm my and s 2 mt 3 um mv on the one hand t 1 s 1 t 2 s 2 t 3 s 3 t 1 s 1 t 2 s 2 s 3 t 3 t 1 1 x y 1 s 2 t 3 s 3 t 1 xs 2 t 3 s 3 t 1 y s 2 t 3 s 3 t 1 xs 2 t 3 y s 2 t 3 s 3 on the other hand t 1 s 1 t 2 s 2 t 3 s 3 t 1 s 1 t 2 s 2 t 3 s 3 t 1 s 1 t 2 1 u v 1 s 3 t 1 s 1 t 2 us 3 t 1 s 1 t 2 v s 3 t 1 s 1 t 2 u s 1 t 2 v s 3 so to prove that t 1 s 1 t 2 s 2 t 3 s 3 t 1 s 1 t 2 s 2 t 3 s 3 it is enough to verify that xs 2 t 3 y s 2 t 3 s 1 t 2 u s 1 t 2 v in fact since xs 2 mt 3 x um mv xum xmv and xu s we have xs 2 t 3 xum xmv 1 xu xmv similarly s 1 t 2 v yv 1 xmv it follows that xs 2 t 3 y s 2 t 3 1 xu xmv y 1 u v 1 1 xu xmv y u yv 1 16 1 xu y u yv 1 xmv 1 x y 1 u yv 1 xmv s 1 t 2 u s 1 t 2 v this shows that the multiplication is associative note that t 1 s 1 1 1 t 1 s 1 1 t 1 1 s 1 t 1 s 1 and 1 1 t 1 s 1 1 t 1 s 1 t 1 1 s 1 t 1 s 1 thus t r s is an associative ring with the identity 1 1 2 since s 1 s 2 1 s 1 1 s 2 s 1 1 s 2 1 s 1 s 2 1 s 1 s 2 s 1 s 2 the map s t r s is a ring homomorphism similarly we can show that t t r s is also a ring homomor phism 3 clearly by the definition of we have m 1 1 it remains to check that is a homomorphism of s t bimodules or equivalently that sat s a t for s s a m and t t to check this we pick up sa s and ta t such that a sam mta then sat ssamt smtat ssamt smtat ssa t s tat 1 ssa t 1 1 s tat 1 1 s 1 sa t 1 1 s ta 1 t 1 1 s 1 sa ta 1 t 1 s a t thanks to lemma 4 4 the ring t r s will be called the noncommutative tensor product of the exact context m m denoted simply by t r s if the exact context m m is clear we should note that the ring t r s is not the usual tensor product of two r algebras first the ring r is not necessarily commutative this means that the usual tensor product of r algebras on the abelian group t r s does not make sense second even if the ring r is commutative we cannot ensure that the product has to coincide with the usual tensor product because the image of r s does not have to be in the center of s this means that s is not necessarily an r algebra nevertheless the ring t r s does generalize the usual tensor product of r algebras in the following sense let r be a commutative ring suppose that s and t are r algebras via and respectively that is the images of and are contained in the centers of s and t respectively if is an exact pair then the noncommutative tensor product t r s coincides with the usual tensor product t r s of r algebras t and s in fact by our notation we have m s r t ids rt and s r t t r s where is determined uniquely by the diagram r s t s r t r s t t r s however since is exact we can check that the switch map s r t t r s defined by s t 7 t s for s s and t t also makes the above diagram commutative that is this implies that thus the multiplication t r s t r s t r s coincides with the usual tensor product of r algebras t and s over r 4 2 examples of noncommutative tensor products in this section we present two general receipts for constructing noncommutative tensor products which show that noncommutative tensor products cover a large variety of interesting algebras 4 2 1 from morita context rings let a c x y f g be an arbitrary but fixed morita context that is a and c are rings with identity x is an a c bimodule y is a c a bimodule f x cy a is a homomorphism of a a bimodules and g y a x c 17 is a homomorphism of c c bimodules such that x 1 y 1 f x 2 x 1 y 1 x 2 g and y 1 x 1 gy 2 y 1 x 1 y 2 f for xi x and yi y with i 1 2 for simplicity we denote by x 1 y 1 and y 1 x 1 the elements x 1 y 1 f and y 1 x 1 g respectively given a morita context a c x y f g we can define the morita context ring a x y c where the multiplication is given by a 1 x 1 y 1 c 1 a 2 x 2 y 2 c 2 a 1 a 2 x 1 y 2 a 1 x 2 x 1 c 2 y 1 a 2 c 1 y 2 c 1 c 2 y 1 x 2 for ai a ci c xi x and yi y let r a 0 0 c s a x 0 c t a 0 y c m a x y c m 1 0 0 1 m and let r s and r t be the canonical inclusions note that the s t bimodule structure on m is induced from the ring structure of the morita context ring since r s t and m s t the quadruple m m is an exact context so we can consider the noncommutative tensor product t r s of this exact context in fact the multiplication in t r s can be described explicitly as follows we identify r mod with the product a mod c mod in this sense rs a x c and tr a y c it follows that the following homomorphism t r s a x y c y a x defined by a 1 0 y 1 c 1 a 2 x 2 0 c 2 7 a 1 a 2 a 1 x 2 y 1 a 2 c 1 c 2 y 1 x 2 is an isomorphism of abelian groups via this isomorphism we identify t r s with and translate the multiplication of t r s into the one of by calculation this multiplication on is exactly given by the following formula a 1 x 1 y 1 c 1 y x a 2 x 2 y 2 c 2 y x a 1 a 2 x 1 y 2 a 1 x 2 x 1 c 2 x 1 y x y 1 a 2 c 1 y 2 yx y 2 c 1 c 2 y 1 x 2 c 1 y x y xc 2 y xy x where x x x and y y y thus t r s in this sense the associated homomorphisms s t r s t t r s and m t r s are given by a 1 x 1 0 c 1 7 a 1 x 1 0 c 1 0 a 1 0 y 1 c 1 7 a 1 0 y 1 c 1 0 a 1 x 1 y 1 c 1 7 a 1 x 1 y 1 c 1 0 respectively note that both and are ring homomorphisms however does not have to be a ring homomorphism in general actually it is a ring homomorphism if and only if y a x 0 moreover it follows from the multiplication of that the map a 1 x 1 y 1 c 1 y x 7 a 1 x 1 y 1 c 1 yx 18 is a surjective ring homomorphism such that idm further let e 1 0 0 0 0 then e 2 e e e a e a y e a x e a x y y a x and e c this also implies that the canonical multiplication map e a e e is an isomorphism of bimodules so if torai y x 0 for all i 0 then the canonical surjective map e is homological for each i 1 we have torri t s tor a i y x thus tor r i t s 0 if and only if tor a i y x 0 let us give some examples to illustrate how the choices of structure maps in the morita contexts influence the noncommutative tensor products of exact contexts in the above construction let k be a field and let a c x y k now we take two different kinds of structure maps f x r y a and g y r x c as follows i let f and g be the canonical isomorphism k k k k then the morita context ring is the matrix ring m 2 k of 2 2 matrices over k in this case the noncommutative tensor product of the corresponding exact context is t r s k k k k k with the multiplication given by a 1 x 1 y 1 c 1 x a 2 x 2 y 2 c 2 x 7 a 1 a 2 x 1 y 2 a 1 x 2 x 1 c 2 x 1 x y 1 a 2 c 1 y 2 xy 2 c 1 c 2 y 1 x 2 c 1 x xc 2 xx where x x ai ci xi yi k for i 1 2 actually this ring is morita equivalent to k k since e 2 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 e 2 e 2 and e e 2 ii let f and g be the zero homomorphism k k k k then the morita context ring denoted by m 2 k 0 has the vector space m 2 k and admits a new multiplication a 1 x 1 y 1 c 1 a 2 x 2 y 2 c 2 a 1 a 2 a 1 x 2 x 1 c 2 y 1 a 2 c 1 y 2 c 1 c 2 note that m 2 k 0 can be identified with the following quiver algebra with relations 1 2 ff 0 in this case the noncommutative tensor product t r s can be calculated analogously and turns out to be isomorphic to the quiver algebra of the same quiver as the above but with only one zero relation 0 clearly this noncommutative tensor product t r s is a quasi hereditary algebra and has m 2 k 0 as its quotient algebra as the foregoing general fact indicated note that the noncommutative tensor products in both i and ii are not derived equivalent to the co product s r t of and in fact and are independent of the choices of structure maps f and g and moreover s r t is given by the following quiver algebra 1 2 ff which is infinite dimensional and hereditary note that if a k algebra is derived equivalent to another finite dimension k algebra then the algebra itself must be finite dimensional since the noncommutative tensor products in both i and ii are finite dimensional they are not derived equivalent to s r t 19 4 2 2 from strictly pure extensions an extension d c of rings is said to be strictly pure if c has an ideal x such that there exists a splitting c d x of d d bimodules such a kind of extensions was used by waldhausen to compute the algebraic k theory of generalized free products in 32 now let r s and r t be two arbitrary strictly pure extensions we shall construct an exact context m m from the pair first of all we fix two split decompositions of r r bimodules s r x and t r y where x and y are ideals of s and t respectively and define m r x y the direct sum of abelian groups next we endow m with a ring structure such that s and t are subrings of m here we define a multiplication on m as follows r 1 x 1 y 1 r 2 x 2 y 2 r 1 r 2 r 1 x 2 x 1 r 2 x 1 x 2 r 1 y 2 y 1 r 2 y 1 y 2 for ri r xi x and yi y with i 1 2 in particular we have x 1 y 1 0 y 1 x 1 in m one can check that under this multiplication m is a ring with identity 1 and contains both s and t as subrings since the intersection of s and t in m is equal to r and since m s t we see that the quadruple m 1 is an exact context clearly torrj t s 0 if and only if tor r j yr rx 0 now we calculate the noncommutative tensor product t r s of the exact content m 1 actually as r r bimodules we have t r s r x y y r x in this case the map s r t m is given by s t 7 st for s s and t t and the map m t r s is exactly the canonical inclusion it follows that s r t t r s is defined as follows r x r y 7 rr ry xr for r r r x x and y y in particular we have x y 0 now we can check that the multiplication t r s t r s t r s is actually given by r 1 x 1 y 1 y 3 x 3 r 2 x 2 y 2 y 4 x 4 r 1 r 2 r 1 x 2 x 1 r 2 x 1 x 2 r 1 y 2 y 1 r 2 y 1 y 2 y 1 x 2 y 3 x 3 r 2 r 1 y 4 x 4 y 1 y 4 x 4 y 3 x 3 x 2 where r 1 r 2 r xi x and yi y for 1 i 4 here we have x 1 y 2 0 and y 1 x 2 y 1 x 2 moreover the following map t r s m r 1 x 1 y 1 y 3 x 3 7 r 1 x 1 y 1 is a surjective ring homomorphism with idm note that may not be a ring homomorphism in general in the following we show that noncommutative tensor products induced from strictly pure extensions cover the trivially twisted extensions in 33 let a be an artin algebra and let a 0 a 1 and a 2 be three artin subalgebras of a with the same identity we say that a decomposes as a twisted tensor product of a 1 and a 2 over a 0 see 35 if the following three conditions hold 1 a 0 is a semisimple k algebra such that a 1 a 2 a 0 and a a 0 rad a as a direct sum of a 0 a 0 bimodules where rad a denotes the jacobson radical of a 2 the multiplication map a 2 a 0 a 1 a is an isomorphism of a 2 a 1 bimodules 3 rad a 1 rad a 2 rad a 2 rad a 1 now we assume that a decomposes as a twisted tensor product of a 1 and a 2 over a 0 then we always have the following decompositions of a 0 a 0 bimodules a 1 a 0 rad a 1 and a 2 a 0 rad a 2 20 where a 0 is a common semisimple subalgebra of a a 1 and a 2 if rad a 1 rad a 2 0 then a is called the trivially twisted tensor product of a 1 and a 2 over a 0 let a be the trivially twisted tensor product of a 1 and a 2 over a 0 then we may take r a 0 s a 1 t a 2 x rad a 1 y rad a 2 and let r s and r t be the inclusions clearly both and are strictly pure by the foregoing discussion m r x y is a ring and m 1 is an exact context so the noncommutative tensor product t r s of this exact context can be defined since xy rad a 1 rad a 2 0 in a the multiplication of the noncommutative tensor product t r s implies that the map t r s a is actually an isomorphism of rings thus a t r s as rings we do not know whether all twisted tensor products of artin algebras can be realized as the noncommu tative tensor products of some exact contexts 5 recollements arising from exact contexts in this section we shall give a procedure to construct recollements of derived module categories of rings from exact contexts throughout this section we assume that r s r t m m is an exact context 5 1 proof of theorem 1 1 in the following we shall first show that noncommutative tensor products t r s can be used to describe noncommutative localizations let b s m 0 t c t r s t r s t r s t r s we define a ring homomorphism 0 b c see section 4 1 for notation furthermore let e 1 1 0 0 0 e 2 0 0 0 1 b and be 1 be 2 s 0 7 sm 0 for s s then is a homomorphism of finitely generated projective b modules if we identify homb be 1 be 2 with m then corresponds to the element m m let us now look at the noncommutative localization b b of b at lemma 5 1 up to isomorphism the map b c is the noncommutative localization of b at proof we first recall a characterization of b in terms of generators and relations in 30 let be the ring defined by the following generators and relations generators ax for any x m relations 1 am 1 2 ax ay ax y for y m 3 asmax asx for s s 4 axamt axt for t t define s s s 7 asm t t t 7 amt and m m x 7 ax for s s t t and x m then s and t are ring homomorphisms moreover by 30 theorem 2 4 the noncommutative localization b b is isomorphic to the following map s m 0 t s m 0 t 21 let t r s t s 7 t t s s amtasm for t t and s s in the following we shall show that is a ring isomorphism such that s m and t thus up to isomorphism the map can be regarded as the noncommutative localization of b at this also means that the noncommutative tensor product of an exact context can be described by generators and relations now we show that is a ring homomorphism clearly 1 1 amam am by the relation 3 to show that preserves multiplications that is t 1 s 1 t 2 s 2 t 1 s 1 t 2 s 2 for si s and ti t for i 1 2 we pick up u s and v t such that s 1 mt 2 um mv then t 1 s 1 t 2 s 2 t 1 1 u v 1 s 2 t 1 us 2 t 1 v s 2 t 1 t us 2 s t 1 v t s 2 s t 1 t u s s 2 s t 1 t v t s 2 s t 1 t u s v t s 2 s note that t 1 s 1 t 2 s 2 t 1 t s 1 s t 2 t s 2 s so it is sufficient to prove that u s v t s 1 s t 2 t or equivalently that aum amv as 1 mamt 2 ac tually due to the relations 2 and 3 we obtain aum amv aum mv as 1 mt 2 as 1 mamt 2 thus is a ring homomorphism next we show that is a bijection in fact the element 1 1 is the identity of t r s and m 1 1 by lemma 4 4 3 moreover for any s s t t and x m we have sm x s m x s x sx and x mt x m t x t xt this implies that there exists a unique ring homomorphism t r s sending ax to x now we check that idt rs and idm indeed the former follows from t s amtasm mt sm m t s m t s t 1 1 s t s while the latter follows from ax x tx 1 1 sx amtx am amasxm amtx asxm ax where sx s and tx t such that x sxm mtx thus is a ring isomorphism note that m by since s 1 s amasm asm s s and t t 1 amtam amt t t we see that s and t remark 5 2 1 if is an exact pair then it follows from lemma 5 1 and 29 theorem 4 10 p 59 that the noncommutative tensor product t r s together with the ring homomorphisms s t r s and t t r s is the coproduct s r t of the r rings s and t over r via the ring homomorphisms r s and r t that is the push out in the category of r rings in this case the map b c is actually given by the following s s r t 0 t t r s t r s t r s t r s s 1 s 2 t 2 0 t 1 7 s 1 s 2 t 2 0 t 1 for si s and ti t with i 1 2 in fact since is an exact pair we have m s r t idm and s r t t r s see section 4 1 for notation further is equal to the following map s r t t r s s 2 t 2 7 s 2 t 2 22 in general for an exact context its noncommutative tensor product may not be isomorphic to the coproduct of the r rings s and t 2 if is a ring epimorphism then t r s endt t r s as rings actually in this case the pair is an exact pair by corollary 4 3 and lemma 4 1 it follows from 1 that s r t t r s further the ring homomorphism t t r s is a ring epimorphism thus t r s endt rs t r s endt t r s endt t r s as rings from now on let p be the complex 0 be 1 be 2 0 in c b with be 1 and be 2 in degrees 1 and 0 respectively that is p con further let p homb p b which is isomorphic to the complex 0 e 2 b e 1 b 0 in c bop with e 2 b and e 1 b in degrees 0 and 1 respectively note that be 1 and be 2 are also right r modules via r s and r t respectively and that the map m s m is a homomorphism of s r bimodules thus is actually a homomorphism of b r bimodules this implies that p is a bounded complex over b z r op and that there is a distinguished triangle in k b z r op be 1 be 2 p be 1 1 by lemma 5 1 the ring homomorphism b c is a ring epimorphism and therefore the restriction functor c mod b mod is fully faithful now we define a full subcategory of d b d b c mod x d b hn x c mod for all n z clearly we have x n d b c mod for all x c mod and all n z also by 8 proposition 3 3 3 we have d b c mod ker homd b tria p x d b homd b p x n 0 for all n z or equivalently d b c mod x d b hn hom b p x 0 for all n z the following result is taken from 8 proposition 3 6 a and b 4 5 see also 23 theorem 0 7 and proposition 5 6 lemma 5 3 let i be the canonical embedding of d b c mod into d b then there is a recollement d b c mod i d b gg i ww tria p gg ww such that i is the left adjoint of i moreover the map b c is homological if and only if hn i i b 0 for all n 6 0 in this case the derived functor d d c d b c mod is an equivalence of triangulated categories to realize tria p in lemma 5 3 by the derived module category of a ring we first show that p is a self orthogonal complex in d b recall that a complex x in d b is called self orthogonal if homd b x x n 0 for any n 6 0 23 lemma 5 4 the following statements are true 1 endd b p r as rings 2 the complex p is self orthogonal in d b that is homd b p p n 0 for any n 6 0 3 there exists a recollement of triangulated categories d b c mod i d b i gg j gg i ww d r j ffff j xx where i is the canonical embedding and j bp lr j hom b p rp b j rhomr p proof 1 note that p is a bounded complex over b consisting of finitely generated projective b modules it follows that endd b p endk b p as rings since homb be 2 be 1 0 we clearly have endk b p endc b p moreover if endb be 1 and endb be 2 are identified with s and t respec tively then we can identify endc b p with k s t s t sm mt which is a subring of s t since m m is an exact context we see that r k as rings thus endd b p r as rings 2 it is clear that homd b p p n homk b p p n 0 for all n z with n 2 since homb be 2 be 1 0 we get homd b p p 1 0 observe that homk b p p 1 0 if and only if homb be 1 be 2 endb be 2 endb be 1 if we identify homb be 1 be 2 endb be 1 and endb be 2 with m s and t respectively then the latter condition is equivalent to that the map m m s t m s t 7 sm mt for s s t t is surjective clearly this is guaranteed by the definition of exact contexts thus 2 holds 3 the idea of our proof is motivated by 19 since p is a complex of b r bimodules the total left derived functor p lr d r d b and the total right derived functor rhomb p d b d r are well defined moreover since p is a bounded complex of finitely generated projective b modules the functor hom b p k b k r preserves acyclicity that is hom b p w is acyclic whenever w c b is acyclic this automatically induces a derived functor d b d r which is defined by w 7 hom b p w therefore we can replace rhomb p with the hom functor hom b p up to natural isomorphism now we claim that the functor p lr is fully faithful and induces a triangle equivalence from d r to tria p to prove this claim we first show that the functor p lr d r d b is fully faithful let y y d r p lr homd r r y n homd b p lr r p lr y n for all n z clearly y is a full triangulated subcategory of d r since p lr commutates with arbitrary direct sums and since p is compact in d b we see that y is closed under arbitrary direct sums in d r in the following we shall show that y contains r it is sufficient to prove that a p lr induces an isomorphism of rings from endd r r to endd r p lr r and b homd b p lr r p lr r n 0 for any n 6 0 since p lr r p in d b we know that a is equivalent to that the right multiplication map r endd r p is an isomorphism of rings and that b is equivalent to homd b p p n 0 for any n 6 0 actually a and b follow directly from 1 and 2 respectively this shows r y thus we have y d r since d r tria r consequently for any y d r there is the following isomorphism p lr homd r r y n homd b p lr r p lr y n for all n z 24 now fix n d r and consider xn x d r p lr homd r x n n homd b p lr x p lr n n for all n z then one can check that xn is a full triangulated subcategory of d r which is closed under arbitrary direct sums in d r since r xn and d r tria r we get xn d r consequently for any m d r we have the following isomorphism p lr homd r m n n homd b p lr m p lr n n for all n z this means that p lr d r d b is fully faithful recall that tria p is the smallest full triangulated subcategory of d b which contains p and is closed under arbitrary direct sums in d b it follows that the image of d r under p lr is tria p see the property 2 in section 2 1 and that p lr induces a triangle equivalence from d r to tria p note that hom b p is a right adjoint of p lr this means that the restriction of the functor hom b p to tria p is the quasi inverse of the functor p lr d r tria p in particular hom b p induces an equivalence of triangulated categories tria p d r furthermore it follows from 8 proposition 3 3 3 that d b c mod x d b homd b p x n 0 for all n z ker hom b p therefore we can choose j p lr and j hom b p since p is a bounded complex of b r bimodules with all of its terms being finitely generated and pro jective as b modules there exists a natural isomorphism of functors see section 2 1 p b hom b p c b c r this implies that the former functor preserves acyclicity since the latter always admits this property it follows that the functors p lb and p b d b d r are naturally isomorphic and therefore j p lb clearly the functor p lb has a right adjoint rhomr p this means that the functor j can also have rhomr p as a right adjoint functor up to natural isomorphism however by the uniqueness of adjoint functors in a recollement we see that j is naturally isomorphic to rhomr p thus we can choose j rhomr p this finishes the proof of 3 lemma 5 5 the following statements hold true 1 i i be 1 i i be 2 in d b 2 hn i i be 1 0 if n 0 torr n t s tor r n t s if n 0 3 if r s is homological then i i be 1 be 2 lr s in d b proof we keep the notation introduced in lemma 5 4 1 applying the triangle functor i i d b d b to the distinguished triangle p 1 be 1 be 2 p in d b we obtain another distinguished triangle in d b i i p 1 i i be 1 i i i i be 2 i i p since the composition functor i j d r d b c mod is zero in the recollement we clearly have i p i j r 0 thus i i i i be 1 i i be 2 is an isomorphism 25 2 first we show that if n 0 or n 1 then hn i i be 1 tor r n t s tor r n t s where torr n t s 0 for n 0 in fact let j j idd b and idd b i i be the counit and unit adjunctions with respect to the adjoint pairs j j and i i in the recollement respectively then for any x d b there is a canonical triangle in d b j j x x x x i i x j j x 1 in particular we have the following triangle in d b j j be 1 be 1 be 1 be 1 i i be 1 j j be 1 1 note that j be 1 homb p be 1 s 1 as complexes of r modules in the following we always identify homb p be 1 with s 1 under this identification we obtain the following triangle in d b p lr s 1 be 1 be 1 be 1 i i be 1 p lr s now for each n z we apply the n th cohomology functor hn d b b mod to this triangle and conclude that if n 0 or n 1 then hn i i be 1 h n p lr s moreover we have p t 0 s m m 0 t con m d rop sincer m m is an exact context it follows from the diagram that the chain map m con con m is a quasi isomorphism this implies that con m con in d rop thus p t con in d rop and p lr s t l r s con l r s in d z in particular we have hn p lr s h n t lr s h n con lr s for all n z applying the functor lr s to the canonical triangle r t con r 1 in d rop we obtain another triangle s t lr s con l r s s 1 in d z this implies that if n 0 or n 1 then hn t lr s h n con lr s and therefore hn i i be 1 h n p lr s h n t lr s h n t lr s tor r n t s tor r n t s next we shall show that h 1 i i be 1 tor r 1 t s tor r 1 t s indeed we have the following two homomorphisms s r s s s 1 s 2 7 s 1 s 2 1 s r s m r s s 1 s 2 7 s 1 m s 2 for s 1 s 2 s and can identify be 1 r s and be 2 r s with s rs 0 and m rs t rs as b modules respectively then there is a chain map in c b p r s 1 g 0 s rs 0 0 10 m rs t rs 0 0 be 1 0 s 0 0 0 0 26 let ps be a deleted projective resolution of the module rs with ps s a quasi isomorphism recall that j be 1 homb p be 1 s 1 then the counit be 1 j j be 1 be 1 is just the composite of the following homomorphisms j j be 1 p lr hom b p be 1 p r ps 1 1 1 p r s 1 g be 1 further let h be the following chain map p h 0 s 0 m 0 m t 0 0 be 1 1 0 s 0 0 0 0 then we have a commutative diagram p r ps 1 1 1 h 1 p r s 1 g h 1 be 1 be 1 1 r ps 1 1 1 be 1 1 r s 1 0 be 1 this implies that the following diagram p lr homb p be 1 h l 1 be 1 1 l r homb p be 1 1 1 0 p lr homb p be 1 be 1 be 1 s 0 is commutative in d b since we have the following distinguished triangle be 2 p h be 1 1 1 be 2 1 in k b z r op there is a homomorphism be 2 lr homb p be 1 1 i i be 1 in d b and a complex w d b such that is completed to the following commutative diagram w w 1 l 1 p lr homb p be 1 h l 1 be 1 1 l r homb p be 1 1 l 1 1 1 0 be 2 1 l r homb p be 1 p 1 lr homb p be 1 p lr homb p be 1 be 1 be 1 s 0 be 1 i i be 1 p 1 lr homb p be 1 w 1 w 1 with rows and columns being distinguished triangles in d b note that such a homomorphism is unique in fact this follows from homd b p 1 lr homb p be 1 i i be 1 homd b j s i i be 1 0 27 now we obtain the following triangle in d b w be 2 l r s i i be 1 w 1 where 1 l 1 this yields a long exact sequence of abelian groups h 1 w h 1 h 1 be 2 l r s h 1 h 1 i i be 1 h 0 w h 0 h 0 be 2 l r s in the sequel we show that the map h 0 h 0 w h 0 be 2 lr s is always injective note that h 0 is the composite of h 0 h 0 w h 0 be 1 lr s with h 0 1 l 1 h 0 be 1 lr s h 0 be 2 l r s and that h 0 be 1 l r s be 1 r s s r s and h 0 be 2 l r s be 2 r s on the one hand applying the functor h 0 to the triangle w be 1 l r s 1 1 0 be 1 w 1 we obtain a short exact sequence 0 h 0 w h 0 s r s s 0 where be 1 is identified with s this implies that h 0 h 0 w ker on the other hand we can identify h 0 1 l 1 with the map r s be 1 r s be 2 r s induced from be 1 be 2 consequently h 0 is the composite of h 0 h 0 w s r s be 1 r s with r s be 1 r s be 2 r s thus h 0 is injective if and only if so is the restriction of r s to ker while the latter is also equivalent to saying that the restriction of the map 1 m r s s r s m r s to ker is injective hence we need to show that ker 1 ker 0 in fact for the ring homomorphism r s the sequence 0 ker s r s s 0 always splits in the the category of r s bimodules since the composite of r s r r s s r s with is an isomorphism of r s bimodules it follows that r s is injective im r s ker 0 and s r s ker im r s now we apply the tensor functor r s to the diagram which is a push out and pull back diagram in the category of r r bimodules and obtain another diagram r r s rs rs s r s 1 t r s m rs m r s which is a push out and pull back diagram in the category of r s bimodules this implies that the map r s induces an isomorphism from ker r s to ker 1 in particular we have ker 1 im r s it follows from im r s ker 0 that ker 1 ker 0 thus h 0 h 0 w h 0 be 2 lr s is injective consequently the map h 1 is surjective and h 1 i i be 1 coker h 1 observe that h 1 is the composite of the isomorphism h 1 h 1 w h 1 be 1 l r s with the map h 1 1 l 1 h 1 be 1 lr s h 1 be 2 l r s therefore we have h 1 i i be 1 coker h 1 coker h 1 1 l 1 so to show that h 1 i i be 1 tor r 1 t s tor r 1 t s it suffices to prove that coker h 1 1 l 1 torr 1 t s tor r 1 t s 28 recall that be 1 s be 2 m t and m 0 s m t in rop mod moreover we have h 1 be 1 lr s torr 1 s s and h 1 be 2 l r s tor r 1 m t s in this sense the map h 1 1 l 1 is actually given by torr 1 m s 0 torr 1 s s tor r 1 m s tor r 1 t s thus coker h 1 1 l 1 coker torr 1 m s tor r 1 t s finally we show that coker torr 1 m s tor r 1 t s in fact since the quadruple m m is an exact context we have the following exact sequence of r r bimodules 0 r s t m m m 0 applying torri s for i 0 1 to this sequence we obtain a long exact sequence of abelian groups 0 torr 1 r s tor r 1 s s tor r 1 t s torr 1 m s torr 1 m s torr 1 m s r r s rs rs s r s s r t since r s r r s s r s is injective the map torr 1 m s torr 1 m s torr 1 s s tor r 1 t s tor r 1 m s is an isomorphism which gives rise to coker torr 1 m s tor r 1 t s it follows that h 1 i i be 1 coker h 1 1 l 1 coker torr 1 m s tor r 1 t s tor r 1 t s tor r 1 t s hence we have shown that hn i i be 1 torr n t s tor r n t s for any n z this finishes the proof of 2 3 note that if is homological then both 1 1 be 1 1 lr homb p be 1 be 1 1 r s 1 and s r s s are isomorphisms this implies that the morphism 1 1 0 be 1 1 l r homb p be 1 be 1 is an isomorphism thus w 0 and i i be 1 be 2 l r s in d b this shows 3 for exact pairs we establish the following result which will be used in the proof of theorem 1 1 lemma 5 6 suppose that is an exact pair and that is homological then 1 torri s t 0 for all i 0 2 given a commutative diagram of ring homomorphisms r s f t g the following statements are equivalent a the ring homomorphism g t is homological b the ring homomorphism f g b m 2 s 1 s 2 t 2 0 t 1 7 s 1 f s 2 f t 2 g 0 t 1 g si s ti t i 1 2 is homological 29 proof 1 let q be the mapping cone of then there is a distinguished triangle in d r r s q r 1 since is homological it follows from 15 theorem 4 4 that induces the following isomorphisms s s lr r s lr s lr s in d s this implies that s lr q 0 in d s and therefore s lr q 0 in d r let i i z be the chain map defined by 1 0 and i 0 for i 6 1 0 since is an exact pair we see that q q r t is an isomorphism in d r it follows that s l r q r t s lr q 0 in d s now applying s lr to the triangle t s r t q r t t 1 we obtain s l r t s l r s r t in d s and also in d r this yields that torri s t tor r i s s r t for all i 0 as s r t is a left s module and is homological it follows that torri s s r t tor s i s s r t 0 for all i 0 and therefore torri s t 0 this shows 1 2 set m 2 let e 1 1 0 0 0 and e 2 0 0 0 1 b and let e e 2 f g then we have e e 2 end e and endb be 2 t observe that e is a projective generator for mod then by morita theory the tensor functor e mod mod is an equivalence of module categories which can be canonically extended to a triangle equivalence d e d d it is clear that e 2 b b e 2 e as t bimodules where the left t module structure of e is induced by g t thus the following diagram of functors between module categories mod e f g mod g b mod e 2 b b t mod is commutative where f g and g stand for the restriction functors induced by the ring homomorphisms f g and g respectively since all of the functors appearing in the diagram are exact we can pass to de rived module categories and get the following commutative diagram of functors between derived module categories d d e d f g d d g d b d e 2 b b d t where the functor d e in the upper row is a triangle equivalence note that f g b respectively g t is homological if and only if the functor d f g respectively d g is fully faithful this means that to prove that a and b are equivalent it is necessary to establish some further connection between d f g and d g in the diagram actually the triangle functor d e 2 b b induces a triangle equivalence from tria be 2 to d t this can be obtained from the following classical recollement of derived module categories d s s ls d b d e 2 b b bb d t bb be 2 l t which arises form the triangular structure of the ring b 30 suppose that the image im d f g of the functor d f g belongs to tria be 2 then we can strengthen the diagram by the following commutative diagram of functors between triangulated cate gories d d f g yyss s s s s s s s d e d f g d d g d b tria be 2 oo d e 2 b b d t this implies that d f g is fully faithful if and only if so is d g and therefore f g is homological if and only if g is homological so to finish the proof of lemma 5 6 2 it suffices to prove that im d f g tria be 2 in the following we shall concentrate on proving this inclusion in fact it is known that d tria e and d f g commutes with small coproducts since it admits a right adjoint therefore according to the property 2 in section 2 1 in order to check the above inclusion it is enough to prove that e tria be 2 when considered as a b module via f g if we identify e 2 b b with the left multiplication functor by e 2 then e tria be 2 if and only if be 2 lt e 2 e e in d b clearly the latter is equivalent to that tortn be 2 e 2 e 0 for any n 0 and the canonical multiplication map be 2 t e 2 e e is an isomorphism set m s r t and write b modules in the form of triples x y h with x t mod y s mod and h m t x y a homomorphism of s modules the morphisms between two modules x y h and x y h are pairs of morphisms where x x and y y are homomorphisms in t mod and s mod respectively such that h m t h with these interpretations we rewrite e b mod where m t is defined by s t 7 s f t g for s s t t and then e 2 e e e as left t modules and be 2 m t as right t modules consequently we have be 2 t e 2 e be 2 t m t 1 and tortn be 2 e 2 e tor t n m t tor t n m for any n 0 this implies that the multiplication map be 2 t e 2 e e is an isomorphism if and only if so is the map it follows that be 2 lt e 2 e e in d b if and only if is an isomorphism of s modules and tortn m 0 for any n 0 in order to verify the latter conditions just mentioned we shall prove the following general result for any module w if we regard w as a left t module via g and an s module via f then the map w m t w w defined by s t w 7 s f t gw for s s t t and w w is an isomorphism of s modules and torti m w 0 for any i 0 to prove this general result we fix a projective resolution v of sr v n v n 1 v 1 v 0 sr 0 with v i a projective right r module for each i by 1 we have torrj s t 0 for any j 0 it follows that the complex v r t is a projective resolution of the right t module m thus the following isomorphisms of complexes of abelian groups v r t t w v r t t w v r w imply that torti m w tor r i s w for any i 0 recall that w admits an s module structure via the map f moreover it follows from f g that the r module structure of w endowed via the ring ho momorphism g is the same as the one endowed via the ring homomorphism f then it follows from being a homological ring epimorphism that the multiplication map s r w w is an isomorphism of s modules and that torri s w 0 for all i 0 see 15 theorem 4 4 therefore for any i 0 we have torti m w tor r i s w 0 note that m t w s r t t w s r t t w s r w w 31 as s modules thus the map w is an isomorphism of s modules so the above mentioned general result follows now by applying the above general result to the ring we can show that is an isomorphism and tortn m 0 for any n 0 this completes the proof of lemma 5 6 2 proof of theorem 1 1 1 let m m be a given exact context where r s and r t are ring homomorphisms by lemma 5 3 the map is homological if and only if hn i i b 0 for all n 6 0 however by lemma 5 5 we see that hn i i b hn i i be 1 hn i i be 1 4 i 1 tor r n t s for each n z thus a and b are equivalent this shows the first part of theorem 1 1 1 assume that is an exact pair such that is homological let t r s be the noncommutative tensor product of m m see lemma 4 4 and c m 2 note that we have the following commuta tive diagram of ring homomorphisms r s t and that the map defined in lemma 5 6 b is equal to b c by remark 5 2 1 it follows from lemma 5 6 2 that the statements a and c in theorem 1 1 are equivalent this finishes the proof of theorem 1 1 1 combining theorem 1 1 1 with lemmas 5 3 and 5 4 3 we have the following result corollary 5 7 if one of the assertions in theorem 1 1 1 holds then there is a recollement of derived module categories d c d d b j ff c lb xx d r ff j xx where d is the restriction functor induced by b c and where j bp lr and j hom b p rp b to prove theorem 1 1 2 we first establish the following result which describes relationships among projective dimensions of special modules over different rings for an r module x we denote the projective dimension of x by proj dim rx corollary 5 8 assume that one of the assertions in theorem 1 1 1 holds then we have the following 1 proj dim rs max 1 proj dim bc and proj dim bc max 2 proj dim rs 1 in particular proj dim rs if and only if proj dim bc 2 proj dim tr max 1 proj dim cb and proj dim cb max 2 proj dim tr 1 in particular proj dim tr if and only if proj dim cb proof note that the ring homomorphisms op rop t op and op rop sop together with m m form an exact context so it is sufficient to show 1 because 2 can be shown similarly we first show that proj dim rs max 1 proj dim bc to see this inequality we use the recollement given in corollary 5 7 clearly there is a triangle in d b p lr p b c p lr p 1 this implies that con is isomorphic in d b to the complex p lr p 1 since con con m in d r by the diagram in section 3 we see that p 1 s con m s con in d r and therefore con p lr s p l r con in d b 32 as p lr d r d b is fully faithful we have homd r s y n homd b p lr s p lr y n for every y r mod and n n suppose that proj dim bc and let s max 1 proj dim bc we claim that homd r s y n 0 for any n s and therefore proj dim rs s since p lr s is a direct summand of con in d b it is enough to show that homd b con p lr y n 0 for any n s recall that con is the complex 0 b c 0 with b and c in degrees 1 and 0 respectively then con is isomorphic in d b to a bounded complex x 0 x s x 1 s x 1 x 0 0 such that x i are projective b modules for all 0 i s let py be a deleted projective resolution of y in r mod then homd b con p lr y n homd b x p lr y n homd b x p r py n homk b x p r py n 0 for any n s where the last equality is due to the observation that all positive terms of the complex p r py are zero this verifies the claim and shows that proj dim rs s next we show that proj dim bc max 2 proj dim rs 1 suppose that proj dim rs m and let m 0 m m m 1 m m 1 m 0 0 be a deleted projective resolution of rs where m i are projective r modules for all m i 0 then p lr s p r m in d b note that con is isomorphic in d r to a complex of the form m 0 m m m 1 m m 1 r m 0 0 in particular m i 0 for i 0 or i max 1 m then p lr con p r m in d b thus con p r m p r m in d b recall that p is the two term complex 0 be 1 be 2 0 over b with be 1 and be 2 in degrees 1 and 0 respectively this implies that con is isomorphic in d b to a complex of the following form n 0 n t n 1 t n 1 n 0 0 where t max 2 m 1 and n i are projective b modules for all t i 0 now let x b mod then homd b con x n homd b n x n homk b n x n 0 for any n t applying homd b x n to the canonical distinguished triangle con 1 b c con in d b we have extnb c x homd b c x n 0 for any n t this shows proj dim bc t proof of theorem 1 1 2 let t r s and c m 2 then the c bimodule induces an equivalence of module categories c c mod mod in view of derived module categories we obtain a triangle equivalence c d c d 33 now assume that one of the assertions in theorem 1 1 1 holds by the above equivalence we know from corollary 5 7 that there exists a recollement of derived module categories d d b ff g xx d r ff j xx where g lb and j bp lr this shows the first part of theorem 1 1 2 by 26 theorem 3 the recollement in corollary 5

proj dim bc if and only if proj dim rs and that proj dim cb if and only if proj dim tr identifying db c with d b up to equivalence we finish the proof of the second part of theorem 1 1 2 5 2 proofs of corollaries in this section we shall prove all corollaries of theorem 1 1 which were mentioned in the introduction all notation introduced in the previous sections will be kept as in section 1 we fix a ring homomorphism r s and let r s q r 1 be the distinguished triangle in the homotopy category k r of r where the complex q stands for the mapping cone of now we set s endd r q and define r s by r 7 f for r r where f is the chain map with f 1 r f 0 r and f i 0 for i 6 0 1 here r and r stand for the right multiplication maps by r and r respectively these data can be recorded in the following commutative diagram r r s r q f r 1 r 1 r s q r 1 the map is called the ring homomorphism associated to if is injective then we shall identify q with s r in d r and further identify with the induced map r endr s r by the right multiplication map recall that denotes the ring endd r s q and that is the induced map homd r s q homd r s q s homd r s q q let stand for the noncommutative localization of at note that homd r s q is an s s bimodule containing now we define a homomorphism of s s bimodules s r s homd r s q s f 7 s f 34 for s s and f s this induces the following ring homomorphism 0 1 s s r s 0 s endr s homd r s q homd r q s s where s endr s is the inclusion under the identification of s with ends s it is natural to ask when the quadruple homd r s q is an exact context actually in 8 lemma 6 5 3 we proved that if is an injective ring epimorphism with torr 1 s s 0 then the pair is exact as a generalization of this result we show the following statement in which is not necessarily injective and q may have non zero cohomology in two degrees lemma 5 9 assume that homr s ker 0 then the quadruple homd r s q is an exact context if is additionally a ring epimorphism then is an exact pair in this case both and are isomorphisms proof applying homd r q to the triangle we have the following long exact sequence homd r s 1 q 1 homd r r 1 q homd r q q homd r s q homd r r q since homr s ker 0 the map homr s is injective as homd r s 1 s homd r s s 1 ext 1 r s s 0 we obtain homd r s 1 q 0 by applying homd r s 1 to the triangle thus the above map is injective next we show that homd r q homd r s q homd r r q is surjective in fact the following diagram homd r s q homd r r q x x homk r s q homk r q homk r r q is commutative where the vertical maps are the canonical localization maps from k r to d r since homr s homr s s homr r s is surjective we see that homk r q is surjective this implies that is surjective as desired let s homd r s q stand for the right multiplication by map then we have the following exact commutative diagram 0 ker r s coker 0 0 homd r r 1 q homd r q q homd r s q homd r r q 0 where the isomorphisms follow from the fact that homd r r n q h n q for n z consequently the chain map con con is a quasi isomorphism this implies that all of their cohomologies are isomorphic note that is exactly the left multiplication by map thus the square in the middle of the above diagram is a pull back and push out diagram and therefore the quadruple homd r s q is an exact context assume that is a ring epimorphism by corollary 4 3 the map s r s homd r s q is an isomorphism of s s bimodules this implies that is an exact pair by lemma 4 1 it remains to show that the ring homomorphism is an isomorphism in fact since is a ring epimorphism we have s ends s endr s as rings thus s endr s is an isomorphism note that the composite of with the valuation map homr s endr s homr r s s f 7 1 f for f endr s 35 coincides with the identity map of s this implies that homr s is an isomorphism and therefore homd r q s 0 consequently the map is an isomorphism proof of corollary 1 2 by lemma 5 9 there is an isomorphism of rings 1 endd r s q b s s r s 0 s which sends 0 0 0 to 0 1 1 0 0 set e 1 1 0 0 0 and e 2 0 0 0 1 b let be 1 be 2 be the map sending s 0 to s 1 0 for s s then corresponds to under the isomorphism 1 thus b and 1 moreover by corollary 5 9 the pair is exact it follows from lemma 5 1 that coincides with b c m 2 s r s this means that is homological if and only if is homological note that s r s s r s ends s r s as rings by remark 5 2 2 since is homological corollary 1 2 follows immediately from theorem 1 1 remark 5 10 the equivalences of 1 and 3 in corollary 1 2 can be obtained under a weaker assumption instead of the homological assumption on precisely we have the following result if homr s ker 0 and ends s endr s then the map is homological if and only if torri s s 0 for each i 1 proof if homr s ker 0 then the quadruple homd r s q is an exact context by lemma 5 9 moreover if ends s endr s then the map homr s homr s s homr r s is an isomorphism which leads to homd r q s 0 and s homd r s q 0 s now the above mentioned result follows immediately from lemma 5 1 and theorem 1 1 1 combining corollary 1 2 with lemma 2 2 we get the following criterion for to be homological corollary 5 11 let be a set of homomorphisms between finitely generated projective r modules suppose that r r is homological such that homr r ker 0 set s r and s r f f then the noncommutative localization of at is homological if and only if the noncommutative localization s s of s at is homological in particular if one of the above equivalent conditions holds then there is a recollement of derived module categories d s d gg xx d r ff xx as a consequence of corollary 5 11 we obtain the following result which can be used to adjudge whether a noncommutative localizations of the form is homological or not corollary 5 12 let f d be an arbitrary extension of rings let d d f be the canonical surjection of f modules set r d d 0 f and s m 2 d let r s be the canonical inclusion and let s s r be the canonical surjection then the noncommutative localization of at is homological if and only if the noncommutative localization e e of e at is homological where e endf d d f and homf d d f d homf d d f d f is the homomorphism of e modules induced by 36 proof since q can be identified with s r in d r we have s endr s r thus the map r s is given by the right multiplication set e 1 1 0 0 0 e 2 0 0 0 1 and e 12 0 1 0 0 r furthermore let re 1 re 2 and s e 1 s e 2 be the right multiplication maps of e 12 and e 12 respectively it follows from lemma 5 1 see also 29 theorem 4 10 and d f f d that r s is the non commutative localization of r at in particular is a ring epimorphism since s e 1 r e 1 r as right r modules the embedding is even homological note that s r can be identified with by corollary 5 11 the map is homological if and only if the map s s is homological clearly r re 1 r f as rings so every f module can be regarded as an r module in particular the f module d d f can be considered as an r module further one can check that the map d d f s r d t f 7 0 0 d t r for d t d is an isomorphism of r modules thus s e as rings under this isomorphism corresponds to and therefore s e as rings it follows that s s is homological if and only if so is e e this finishes the proof before starting with the proof of corollary 1 3 we introduce a couple of more definitions and notation recall from 28 that a complex u in d r is called a tilting complex if u is self orthogonal isomor phic in d r to a bounded complex of finitely generated projective r modules and tria u d r it is well known that if u is a tilting complex over r then d r is equivalent to d endd r u as triangulated categories see 28 theorem 6 4 in this case r and endd r u are called derived equivalent we refer the reader to 18 for some new advances in constructions of derived equivalences if i is an index set we denote by u i the direct sum of i copies of u in d r the following result generalizes some known results in the literature see for example 15 theorem 4 14 1 theorem 3 5 5 and 34 lemma 3 1 3 where the ring homomorphism r s is required to be injective we shall use this generalization to prove corollary 1 3 lemma 5 13 let r s be a ring homomorphism and let i be an arbitrary nonempty set define u s q then homd r u u i n 0 for any 0 6 n z if and only if the following conditions hold 1 homr s ker 0 and 2 extir s s i 0 exti 1 r s r i for any i 1 in particular the complex u is a tilting complex in d r if and only if homr s ker 0 ext 1 r s s 0 and there is an exact sequence 0 p 1 p 0 rs 0 of r modules such that pi is finitely generated and projective for i 0 1 proof recall that we have a distinguished triangle r s q r 1 in k r first of all we mention two general facts let i be an arbitrary nonempty set a by applying homd r s i to one can prove that homd r q s i i homd r s s i i for i z 0 and homd r q s i ker homr s i b by applying homd r r i to one can show that homd r q r i j homd r s r i j for j z 0 1 next we show the necessity of the first part of lemma 5 13 suppose that homd r u u i n 0 for any n 6 0 then extir s s i homd r q s i i 0 for any i 1 and homd r s q 1 0 consequently the map homr s homr s r homr s s is 37 injective this means that the condition 1 holds further applying homd r s to the triangle r i i s i i q i r i 1 we get exti 1 r s r i homd r s q i i 0 thus the conditions 1 and 2 in lemma 5 13 are satisfied in the following we shall show the sufficiency of the first part of lemma 5 13 assume that the conditions 1 and 2 in lemma 5 13 hold true then it follows from a and b that homd r q s i n 0 homd r q r i m 1 for n z 0 and m z 1 0 applying homd r q to the triangle r i i s i i q i r i 1 one can show that homd r q q i m 0 for m z 1 0 furthermore we shall show that the condition 1 in lemma 5 13 implies also that homd r q q i 1 0 clearly homr s ker i homr s ker i 0 where ker i stands for the direct product of i copies of ker since ker i contains ker i as a submodule we infer that homr s ker i 0 and ker homr s i homr s ker i 0 now it follows from the following exact commutative diagram 0 homd r q q i 1 1 homd r q r i i homd r q s i 0 ker homr s i homr s r i i homr s s i that ker homr s i homr s ker i 0 and therefore homd r q q i 1 0 thus homd r q q i n 0 for n 6 0 it remains to prove that homd r s q i n 0 for n 6 0 actually applying homd r s to the triangle r i i s i i q i r i 1 we have the following long exact sequence homd r s s i j homd r s q i j homd r s r i j 1 i homd r s s i j 1 for j z since homd r s s i r 0 for 0 6 r z and homd r s r i t 0 for t z 0 1 we see that homd r s q i j 0 for j z 1 0 and that homd r s q i 1 ker homr s i 0 it follows that homd r s q i n 0 for n 6 0 hence homd r u u i n 0 for any n 6 0 this finishes the proof of the sufficiency as to the second part of lemma 5 13 we observe the following the complex u over r is a generator of d r that is tria u d r since r tria u by the triangle moreover the complex u is a tilting complex in d r if and only if it is self orthogonal and rs has a projective resolution of finite length consisting of finitely generated projective r modules furthermore if rs has finite projective dimension and exti 1 r s r i 0 for any i 1 then rs does have projective dimension at most 1 thus by the first part of lemma 5 13 we can show the second part of lemma 5 13 proof of corollary 1 3 1 by corollary 1 2 the map is homological if and only if torrj s s 0 for all j 1 now we assume that rs has projective dimension at most 1 then tor r i s s 0 for all i 2 this implies that is homological if and only if torr 1 s s 0 since be 2 s s r s as right r modules it suffices to show that torr 1 be 2 s 0 in fact from lemma 5 4 3 we obtain a triple j j j of adjoint functors let idd b j j be the unit adjunction with respect to the adjoint pair j j then we have the following fact for any x d b there exists a canonical triangle in d b i i x x x j j x i i x 1 38 where j j x rhomr p hom b p x for the other triple i i i of adjoint triangle functors we refer the reader to lemma 5 4 3 let 0 p 1 p 0 rs 0 be a projective resolution of rs with all p j projective r modules this exact sequence gives rise to a triangle p 1 p 0 s p 1 1 in d r then we see from the recollement in lemma 5 4 3 that there is the following exact commutative diagram i i be 2 r p 1 be 2 r p 1 be 2 rp 1 1 j j be 2 r p 1 j j 1 i i be 2 r p 1 1 i i be 2 r p 0 be 2 r p 0 be 2 rp 0 j j be 2 r p 0 i i be 2 r p 0 1 i i be 2 l r s be 2 l r s be 2 l r s j j be 2 l r s i i be 2 l r s 1 i i be 2 r p 1 1 be 2 r p 1 1 j j be 2 r p 1 1 i i be 2 r p 1 2 since i i be 1 be 2 l r s in d b by lemma 5 5 3 we know that j j be 2 l r s j j i i be 1 0 due to j i 0 in the recollement it follows that j j 1 is an isomorphism and so is h 0 j j 1 suppose that h 0 p p h 0 j j p is injective for any projective b module p then h 0 be 2 rp 1 is injective since rp 1 is projective it follows from the isomorphism h 0 j j 1 that the map 1 be 2 r p 1 be 2 r p 0 is injective this implies that torr 1 be 2 s 0 as desired thus in the following we shall prove that h 0 p p h 0 j j p is injective for any projective b module p first we point out that h 0 p is injective if and only if homd b b p j homd r j b j p is injective to see this we consider the the following composite of maps nx homd b b x n j homd r j b j x n homd b b j j x n for each n z where the second map is an isomorphism induced by the adjoint pair j j then one can check directly that nx homd b b x n it is known that the n th cohomology functor h n d b b mod is naturally isomorphic to the hom functor homd b b n so under this identification the map nx coincides with h n x hn x hn j j x it follows that h 0 p is injective if and only if so is the map homd b b p j homd r j b j p second we claim that if homd b i i b p 0 then homd b b p j homd r j b j p is injective let j j idd b be the counit adjunction with respect to the adjoint pair j j then for each x d b there exists a canonical triangle in d b j j x x x i i x j j x 1 now we consider the following morphisms homd b b x m j homd r j b j x m homd b j j b x m for any m z where the last map is an isomorphism given by the adjoint pair j j one can check that the composite of the above two morphisms is the map homd b b x m this means that to show that 39 homd b b p j homd r j b j p is injective it suffices to show that homd b b p is injective for this aim we apply homd b p to the triangle j j b b b i i b j j b 1 and get the following exact sequence of abelian groups homd b i i b p homd b b p homd b b p homd b j j b p if homd b i i b p 0 then homd b b p is injective and therefore the map j homd b b p homd r j b j p is injective as desired third we show that if homr s s 0 then homd b i i b p 0 for any projective b module p in fact due to lemma 5 5 1 and 3 we have i i be 2 i i be 1 be 2 l r s in d b this implies that homd b i i b p 0 if and only if homd b be 2 l r s p 0 now we consider the following isomorphisms homd b be 2 l r s p homd r s rhomb be 2 p homd r s e 2 p homr s e 2 p since e 2 b s as r modules we have homr s e 2 b homr s s 0 note that p add bb and e 2 p add rs thus there is an index set i such that e 2 p is a direct summand of s i since s i is a submodule of the product s i of s it follows that homr s s i is a subgroup of homr s s i which is isomorphic to homr s s i hence homr s s i 0 homr s e 2 p 0 and homd b i i b p 0 as desired now it remains to show that homr s s 0 in the following we shall prove a stronger statement namely homd r s s n 0 for any n z since is a ring epimorphism with torr 1 s s 0 we know from 29 theorem 4 8 that ext 1 r s s i ext 1 s s s i 0 for any set i as rs is of projective dimension at most 1 we can apply lemma 5 13 to the complex u s q and get homd r u u m 0 for m 6 0 this implies that homd r q q m 0 for m 6 0 and that hm rhomr q q homd r q q m 0 if m 6 0 s if m 0 thus the complex rhomr q q is isomorphic in d r to the stalk complex s on the one hand by the adjoint pair q lr rhomr q of the triangle functors we have homd r s s n homd r s rhomr q q n homd r s rhomr q q n rhomr q lr s q n for any n z on the other hand since is homological by assumption the homomorphism lr s r l r s s lr s is an isomorphism in d r it follows from the triangle r l r s lr s s lr s q lr s r l r s 1 that q lr s 0 hence homd r s s n rhomr q lr s q n 0 for any n z thus we have proved that for any projective b module p the homomorphism h 0 p p h 0 j j p is injective in b mod this finishes the proof of corollary 1 3 1 2 from lemma 5 4 3 we see that the ring is zero if and only if the functor j induces a triangle equivalence from d b to d r this is equivalent to the statement that j b is a tilting complex over r note that j b u 1 thus the ring is zero if and only if u is a tilting complex over r now corollary 1 3 2 follows directly from lemma 5 13 proof of corollary 1 4 40 1 let r s be the inclusion s s r the canonical surjection and r s the induced map by right multiplication since is injective we know from lemma 5 9 that homr s s r is an exact context if rs is flat then tor r i s s 0 for all i 1 now 1 follows from theorem 1 1 2 since is an injective ring epimorphism the pair is exact by lemma 5 9 since the ring r is commutative and is homological the ring s is also commutative by 8 lemma 6 5 5 consequently the noncommutative tensor product s r s coincides with the usual tensor product s r s of s and s over r see section 4 1 by lemma 5 6 we know that torri s s 0 for any i 0 since r s and s are commutative rings we have torri s s torri s s 0 thus the assertion 3 in corollary 1 2 is satisfied it follows from corollary 1 2 that the ring homomorphism s r s s r s is a ring epimorphism this im plies that ends s r s ends rs s r s s r s as rings note that s endr s as rings and that homr s r s 0 since is a ring epimorphism thus endr s s r b as rings now 2 is an immediate consequence of corollary 1 2 proof of corollary 1 5 for a commutative ring r and a multiplicative set of r the localization map r s 1 r is al ways homological since rs is flat therefore by corollary 1 4 2 it suffices to show that homr s r s 0 and that s r s is isomorphic to 1 s actually the former follows from the fact that is a ring epimor phism to check the latter we verify that the well defined map s r 1 r 1 s y r x 7 r y x for y s r r and x is an isomorphism of rings where r s is the right multiplication map clearly is surjective to see that this map is injective we note that the map 1 s s r 1 r y x 7 y 1 x for y s and x is a well defined ring homomorphism with 1 observe that preserves the multiplication of s r s this finishes the proof of corollary 1 5 6 examples now we present a few examples to show that some conditions in our results cannot be dropped or weakened 1 the condition that r s is a homological ring epimorphism in corollary 1 2 cannot be weakened to that r s is a ring epimorphism let r k 0 0 k x x 2 k 0 k x x 2 k x x 2 k where k is a field and k x is the polynomial algebra over k in one variable x let s be the 3 by 3 matrix ring m 3 k x x 2 then the inclusion of r into s is a noncommutative localization of r and therefore a ring epimorphism further we have torr 1 s s 0 6 tor r 2 s s see 24 thus is not homological so rs cannot have projective dimension less than or equal to 1 moreover one can check that the ring homomorphism r s associated to is an isomorphism of rings recall that the pair is exact by lemma 5 9 and further that s r s s r s s as rings by remark 5 2 in this sense we have 1 s s consequently is not homological however due to remark 5 10 the map is homological since torri s s torri r s 0 for each i 1 hence without the homological assumption on the conditions 1 and 2 in corollary 1 2 are not equivalent 2 the condition that is homological does not guarantee that the noncommutative localization of at in corollary 1 2 is always homological in the following we shall use corollary 5 12 to produce a counterexample 41 now take f a 0 b a a b k and d k 0 k k with k a field then one can verify that the extension r s defined in corollary 5 12 is homological and that the canonical map d d f is a split epimorphism in f mod and therefore d f d f as f modules let e be the idempotent of e corresponding the direct summand f of the f module d d f then e e eee m 2 k further more the noncommutative localization e e of e at is equivalent to the canonical surjection e e eee since ext 2 e e eee e eee 6 0 the map is not homological this implies that is not homological too thus is not homological by corollary 5 12 that is the restriction functor d d d is not fully faithful in addition one can check that for this extension the r module rs has infinite projective dimension 3 in corollary 1 3 1 we assume that the projective dimension of rs is at most 1 but there does exist an injective homological ring epimorphism r s such that the projective dimension of rs is greater than 1 and that is homological let r be a pru fer domain which is not a matlis domain recall that a matlis domain is an integral domain r for which the projective dimension of the fractional field q of r as an r module is at most 1 in this case the inclusion r q is an injective homological ring epimorphism by corollary 1 2 the map is homological acknowledgement the authors thank federik marks for some discussions on
