abstract quantum field theory allows more general symmetries than groups and lie algebras for instance quantum groups that is hopf alge bras have been familiar to theoretical physicists for a while now nowdays many examples of symmetries of categorical flavor cate gorical groups groupoids lie algebroids and their higher analogues appear in physically motivated constructions and faciliate construc tions of geometrically sound models and quantization of field theories here we consider two flavours of categorified symmetries one coming from noncommutative algebraic geometry where varieties themselves are replaced by suitable categories of sheaves another in which the gauge groups are categorified to higher groupoids together with their gauge groups also the fiber bundles themselves become cate gorified and their gluing or descent data is given by nonabelian cocycles generalizing group cohomology where groupoids appear in the role both of the domain and the coefficient object such cocy cles in particular represent higher principal bundles gerbes possibly equivariant possibly with connection as well as the corresponding associated higher vector bundles we show how

an overview for a general audience of mathe matical physicists of some appearances of categorified symmetries of geo metrical spaces and symmetries of constructions related to physical theories on spaces our main emphasis is on geometric and physical motivation and the kind of mathematical structures involved sections 2 4 treat examples in noncommutative geometry while 5 6 introduce nonabelian cocycles mo tivated in physics in sections 6 9 we discuss some technical details concerning differential cocycles and their quantization part of these sections can be understood as a research anouncement warning on versions the original version of this article has been sub mitted in december 2008 and appeared in 5 th summer school of modern mathematical physics sfin xxii series a conferences no a 1 2009 397 424 editors branko dragovich zoran rakic in this arxiv version we have slightly updated some introductory points and in particular the subsections 2 5 and 7 2 are entirely new section 7 1 on connections on principal bundles is also new and serves to provide some more back ground for the examples in section 9 where for instance the discussion of the electromagnetically charged quantum particle from a categorical per spective is new and the whole subsection 9 7 on chern simons theory we have also appended the list of additional mainly new references alpha betically just below the original references 1 48 one should especially mention the important reference arxiv 0905 0731 fhlt which touches on similar issues of categorical foundations of quantum physics as the the work sketched here and in the larger manuscript 36 also from december 2008 we should also note that since publication many aspects of this and http arxiv org abs 0905 0731 4 urs schreiber zoran s koda related work were discussed or presented in the online project nlab 66 in which we are participating 1 1 categories and generalizations we assume the reader is familiar with basics of the theory of categories functors and sheaves as the mathematical physics community has adopted these by now at a few places for instance we use co limits in categories readers familiar with enriched and higher category theory 3 24 65 72 can skip this subsection the concept of a category c is often extended in several directions 2 4 24 leading to the internal categories internal groupoids monoidal categories enriched categories strict n categories and various flavours of weak higher categories we will just sketch the terminology for orientation instead of a set c 1 obc of objects and set c 0 morc of morphisms with the usual operations assignment of identity i x 7 idx to x do main source and codomain target maps s t c 1 c 0 composition of composable pairs of morphism c 1 c 0 c 1 c 1 one defines an inter nal category in some ambient category a by specifying object of objects c 0 and object of morphism c 1 which are both objects in a together with morphisms i s t as above and satisfying analogous relations an inter nal groupoid is an internal category equipped with an inverse assigning morphism 1 c 1 c 1 satisfying the usual properties for instance smooth groupoids lie groupoids are internal groupoids in the category of manifolds 2 14 23 40 a category may be given additional structure e g a monoidal category is equipped with tensor monoidal products and tensor unit object cf 4 24 29 and section 3 given a monoidal category d a d enriched category c has a set of objects but each set of morphisms homc a b is replaced by an object d in d it is required that the composition be a monoidal functor in particular d may be the cat egory of small categories in which case a d enriched category is precisely a 2 category it has morphisms between morphisms this process may be iterated and leads to n categories of various flavour with n morphisms or n cells as morphisms between n 1 morphisms a strict n 1 category is the same as ncat enriched category where ncat is the category of strict n categories and strict n functors if the cells for all n 0 are allowed we are dealing with categories it is natural to weaken the associativity conditions for compositions of k cells for 0 k n this weakening is difficult to deal with and there are multiple definitions but this weakening is often naturally arising in applications and is more natural from the point of view of category theory itself thus one can talk about weak n categories 3 24 65 72 the weakening is much easier if the higher cells are invertible these are by definition the n 1 categories in the sense of baez and dolan including the case of 1 categories which are of central importance in appli cations more generally we may talk on n k categories of in general weak n categories only r cells for r k are invertible and in particular of k categories according to grothendieck s homotopy hypothesis from 58 ex categorified symmetries 5 plained also in 3 65 24 72 0 categories i e weak groupoids are equivalent to topological spaces in particular 1 categories can be modelled as categories enriched over a convenient category top of topolog ical spaces alternatively instead of describing combinatorially n cells and the algebra of various compositions among them one can model 1 categories as simplicial sets satisfying the inner kan conditions which are certain existence properties which together replace the algebraic structure of higher compositions this model is also known under the name of quasi categories most recently thomas nikolaus 67 has found a mixture of algebraic and simplicial definition in which the existence is accompanied with additional choices making the comparison between the topological and algebraic models of higher categories more transparent the language of quillen model categories helps to compare various mod els for categories see 6 1 1 2 basic idea of descent suppose we are given a geometric space and its decomposition in pieces with some intersections e g an open cover of a manifold the manifold can be reconstructed as the disjoint union modulo the identification of points in the pairwise intersections for this we need to specify the identifications explicitly and they may be considered as additional data suppose we now want to glue not the underlying sets but some structures above e g vector bundles bundles on each open set u of the cover form a category vec and there are restriction functors from vec to the localized category of bundles on u u u a global bundle f is determined by its restrictions f to each open set u of the cover together with identifications f u f f u via some isomorphisms f these isomorphisms satisfy the cocycle condition f f f and f id the data f f are called descent data 19 9 47 equivalence classes of descent data are cohomology classes with values in the automorphism group of the typical fiber and they correspond to isomorphism classes bundles over the base space there are vast generalizations of this theory cf 19 9 46 36 40 41 gluing categories of quasicoherent sheaves modules see section 2 on their role over noncommutative nc localizations which replace open sets 34 33 44 is a standard tool in nc geometry localization functors q for different usually do not commute what may be pictured as a noncommutativity of intersections of open sets in order to reconstruct the module from its localizations restrictions to localized regions we need match at both consecutive localizations q q and q q 2 from noncommutative spaces to categories 2 1 idea of a space and of a noncommutative space by a noncommutative nc space 14 34 44 we mean any object for which geometrical intuition is available and whose description is given by the data pertaining to some geometrical objects living on the space sup pose we measure observable corresponding to some property depending on 6 urs schreiber zoran s koda a local position in space if the position changes from one part to another part of a space we get different measurements thus the measurements are expected to be functions of the local position if the space is made out of points and we can make measurements closely about each point then we get a function on the underlying set of points this corresponds to the observables on phase space in classical physics the quantum physics and noncommutative geometry mean that we can not decompose some spaces to points hence we can not really construct set theoretic functions still one can often localize observables to some geometrical parts if not points 2 2 gel fand naimark the most standard case is when the space is represented by a c valued algebra a if a is commutative then the points of the space correspond to the characters nonzero homomorphisms a c or equivalently to maximal ideals i ker in a knowing all functions at all points physi cally means being able to measure all local quantities and mathematically expresses thegel fand naimark theorem from the c algebra of contin uous c valued functions on a compact hausdorff space we can reconstruct back the space as the gel fand spectrum of a 14 23 the gel fand spectrum can be constructed for nc algebras as well but in that process we lose information and get smaller commutative algebras the spectrum is roughly extracting the points together with some topology and there are not sufficiently many points to determine the nc space instead one is trying to express the geometrical and physical constructions we need in terms of algebra a at least for good a s of physical interest this strat egy usually works e g for small nc deformations of commutative algebras thus such a quantum algebra is by physicists usually called a nc space we emphasise that there are more general nc spaces and more general types of their description 2 3 nonaffine schemes and gluing of quasicoherent sheaves we often know how the local coordinate charts look like and glue them to gether the global ring is in principle sufficient information in c algebraic framework but many constructions are difficult as one has to make cor rect choices in operator analysis thus sometimes one resorts to algebraic geometry that is algebras of regular polynomial functions but even com mutative algebraic variety scheme x is not always determined by its ring of global regular functions o x even if it is we may find convenient to glue together more complicated objects say fiber bundles over the space from pieces one way or another we need to glue the spaces represented by algebras of functions to an object which will not loose information as the global coordinate ring sometimes does if we have some sort of a cover of the space by collection of open sets ui where on each ui the algebra of functions determines the space then having all of them together conserves all local information moreover we should be able to pass to other open sets thus one needs a correspondence which to every open set gives an algebra of observables that is some sheaf of functions in the case of commutative space to do the same for fibre bundles means that we need to do the same categorified symmetries 7 for sheaves of sections of other bundles it seems reasonable to take a cate gory of all sheaves of suitable kind on the space as a replacement of space this point of view in geometry was advocated by a grothendieck in 1960 s geometry of toposes gabriel rosenberg s theorem states that every algebraic scheme x typical geometrical space in algebraic geometry can be reconstructed up to an isomorphism of schemes from the abelian category qcohx of quasicoherent sheaves on x 34 for noetherian schemes a smaller tensor abelian subcategory cohx of coherent sheaves is enough and in some cases even its derived category db cohx in the sense of homological algebra 31 2 4 noncommutative generalizations of qcohx examples suggest that instead of small deformations of commutative al gebras of functions we may consider deformations and similarly behaved analogues of categories qcohx principal examples appeared related to mirror symmetry mirror symmetry is a duality involving two calabi yau 3 folds x and y saying that n 2 scft s a model on x and b model on y and viceversa a model on y and b model on x are nontrivially equivalent as n 1 scft s the difference at n 2 level is in a 1 eigenvalue of an additional u 1 symmetry operator what is physically not distinguishable in 1994 maxim kontsevich proposed the homological mirror symmetry conjecture 27 which is an equivalence of a categories related to topological a and b models in a model the a category in volved is the fukaya category defined in terms of symplectic geometry on x y and b model is the a enhancement of the derived category of coher ent sheaves on y x kontsevich also suggested a definition of a category of b branes in n 2 landau ginzburg models 21 26 which have very similar structure to but are different from the derived categories of coher ent sheaves on quasiprojective varieties there are known relations between hochschild cohomology expressed in terms of db cohx and n point cor relation functions in the corresponding scft around 2003 kontsevich and independently k costello found a way to go back and reconstruct scft from sufficiently good but abstract a categories 15 26 where good involves generalizations of certain properties of a enhancement of db cohx where x is a calabi yau variety this shows that indeed physically relevant generalizations and deformations of varieties of complex algebraic geometry may come out of generalizations of algebraic geometry in terms of categories of sheaves and their abstract generalizations 2 5 abelian versus categories while abelian categories of quasicoherent sheaves 68 34 contain all the information on a variety this is not always true for their derived categories or enhanced versions of those 54 62 63 recent years have witnessed a subject of derived algebraic geometry dag cf 63 26 74 75 which helped redefine many constructions in the usual geometry in a fruitful and natural manner the geometric spaces are there understood as higher cat egorical entities in the functor of points view on schemes the commutative 8 urs schreiber zoran s koda rings as opposite to local models are replaced by commutative dg or sim plicial rings and presheaves of sets by presheaves of simplicial sets this allows for notions of constructions uo to coherent homotopy and in par ticular of derived version of many natural constructions and functors in particular many new moduli spaces are constructed in this framework while the framework of dag has extended the commutative algebraic geometry and can treat the usual schemes as special case of derived schemes the passage from the representation of the category of quasicoherent sheaves to its derived version looses some information in general there are severals ways to do a derived category it is well known that the usual triangulated version is bad for many reasons including the nonfunctoriality of cones and that one can replace it by an enhanced version the enhanced versions are very natural from the categorical point of view but even they do not contain full information which the abelian category of quasicoherent sheaves have all of them are just a derived version of a usual scheme while the usual schemes can be embedded into the bigger world of derived schemes the replacement of the abelian category of quasicoherent sheaves by the enhanced triangulated category is not a faithful functor there are several versions of enhancements of a triangulated category that is their replacements by a pretriangulated differential graded category by pretriangulated a category or by a stable category 54 61 53 in characteristics zero all of the three approaches are equivalent being pretriangulated or stable are properties rather than structures now coming back to noncommutative geometry the replacement of an algebraic variety by a stable category or say a version of it can also be fitted into the functor of points point of view then there is no difference in formalism between the derived algebraic geometry based on simplicial presheaves on derived affine schemes as with the derived geometry based on representing spaces by stable infinity categories thus there is no signifi cant difference between derived commutative and derived noncommutative geometry while there is a more serious difference between the commutative and noncommutative geometry at the level of abelian categories of sheaves seen for example in localization theory of noncommutative algebras which are large in the sense close to free algebras 3 monoidal categories as symmetries of nc spaces 3 1 basic appearances of hopf algebras the role of symmetry objects extends to the nc world they help us sin gling out good candidates for the underlying space time of a theory and one employs the covariance properties of the tensors built out of field variables when constructing model lagrangeans in qft one wants not only that the fields form a representation of a symmetry algebra but also to describe the second quantized systems where the hilbert space h is replaced by its exponent the direct sum of n particle hilbert spaces for all n which are in bosonic case for simplicity the symmetric powers of 1 particle hilbert space h thus the symmetry has to be defined on tensor products of rep resentation spaces classical example addition of angular momenta of sub systems hopf algebras have the structure sufficient to define the tensor categorified symmetries 9 product of representations and the dual representations 28 29 and each finite group gives rise to a hopf algebra group algebra with the same representation theory locally compact groups considered in axiomatic qft may also be generalized to hopf algebra like structures called locally compact quantum groups if the underlying space is undeformed and in 4 d the axiomatic qft actually proves that the full symmetry is decribed by a locally compact group but in dimension 2 exotic braiding symmetries and quantum groups are allowed in nc case a generic model will have a nonclassical symmetry the symmetry algebra is here understood in the usual sense consisting of all observables commuting with the hamilto nian the natural hamiltonians preserve the symmetries of the underlying space geometry but there are often other symmetries which are not the symmetries of the underlying space there are also hidden symmetries not seen at hamiltonian level but only in solutions now we want to discuss the geometrical symmetries of bare underlying noncommutative space for this we need to discuss more carefully a role of hopf algebras recall 29 that a hopf algebra h is an associative unital algebra equipped with a counital coassociative coproduct h h h which is a morphism of algebras starting with any say finite group one may form its group algebra cg which is a hopf algebra whose representations coincide with the representations of the group on the other hand the group itself may be replaced by a suitable algebra of functions o g on it and then the corepresentations of o g linear maps v v o g with id id will correspond to the representations of g o g is commutative and one may consider noncommutative hopf algebras instead and they are in abundance 29 since the discovery of quantum groups 3 2 a problem with tensor product mathematically replacing the commutative algebras by the noncommu tative one should change the tensor product of commutative algebras a categorical coproduct in the category of commutative algebras by the so called free product of noncommutative algebras in all considerations this would yield straightforward transfer of many constructions and their properties however examples of hopf algebras with respect to the categor ical coproduct are just few while usual nc hopf algebras with respect to e g quantum groups are abundant in physical applications many prac tioners ignore these facts and simply work with the usual tensor product however we suggest a better understanding of this situation 45 from the perspective of categories of modules quasicoherent sheaves rather than algebras 3 3 replacing hopf co actions with geometrically admissible actions of monoidal categories recall that in the commutative case a mod is equivalent to qcohspeca and that we took a viewpoint that the categories like qcohx are repre senting spaces h mod and h comod where h is a hopf algebra are rigid 10 urs schreiber zoran s koda monoidal categories a monoidal category is a category equipped with a bifunctor monoidal or tensor product which is associative up to co herent isomorphisms m n p m n p this category has a unit object 1 satisfying 1 m m m 1 and this category has dual ob jects m with usual properties rigidity autonomous category not only qcohx remembers schemex gabriel rosenberg theorem also in favorite cases h mod as a rigid monoidal category remembers the underlying hopf algebra or hopf algebroids appearing as symmetries of inclusions of fac tors 8 relevant to cft this is an aspect of so called tannakian duality used widely in physics e g the doplicher roberts duality dealing with reconstruction of a qft in 4 d out of knowledge of full symmetry algebra is also a form of tannaka reconstruction theorem some reconstructions in cft are as well 29 ch 9 the reason why the usual hopf algebras geometrically still fit into nc world is that the hopf actions h a a i e when a is h module algebra 29 or hopf coaction a a h a is h comodule algebra induce an action of the monoidal category of h comodules 1 st case or h modules 2 nd case on a mod cf 45 for recipes how to induce the categorical actions in these cases hopf coaction is hence replaced by an action bifunctor a mod h mod a mod the action axiom is the mixed associativity with product in h mod namely m n p m n p replacing the hopf algebra h by its monoidal category of left modules h mod we can as well replace the hopf coaction of h on a by the corresponding action of h mod while in these affine cases co actions of hopf algebras induce for non commutative geometry more fundamental categorical actions in some more general nonaffine situations the usual co actions of hopf algebras do not make sense and need to be replaced by a categorical device anyway for example if we want to globalize the action of hopf algebra to nonaffine noncommutative varieties then the latter may not be represented by a single algebra but rather by the gluing data for several algebras as the co action usually does not make the affine pieces invariant one really needs to talk about a coaction of hopf algebra on the entire category of sheaves glued from pieces but such coaction has no sense literally unless we re place the hopf algebra by its monoidal category of modules as well which can act in the categorical sense one should emphasise that not all actions of monoidal categories are good in this framework a monoidal category usually has some origin which is understood over the ground scheme for example the category of mod ules over a hopf algebra h over a commutative ground ring k knows that its hopf algebra structure is made sense of by the tensor product in the category of k modules in particular the tensor product on the category of h modules exists because the coproduct of h is defined using the ten sor product of k modules the category of h modules naturally acts on the category of k modules just by forgetting the h module structure and tensoring over k now any action on a category of quasicoherent sheaves over some noncommutative k scheme must be compatible with that original defining action in the sense that the direct image functor to the ground scheme represented by the category of k modules intertwines the actual categorified symmetries 11 action and the canonical action on the ground scheme abstract actions of monoidal categories satisfying this property were defined in our earlier paper 45 as geometrically admissible actions 3 4 principal bundles on noncommutative schemes we now have to answer which geometrically admissible actions are principal in the noncommutative setup in which the space is replaced by a category of would be quasicoherent sheaves what are locally trivial bundles and how can they be expressed by the cocycle like data this is partly understood in the categorical framework but not widely known geometrical admissibility of actions of monoidal category in the case when both the total space and the base quotient space of the action are affine can be understood as a construction of the action by lifting the canonical action on the base to the total space in category theory such lifts were studied for co monads and lead to the concept of a distributive law one of the authors has worked out a slightly more general case when the monad or comonad is replaced by a monoidal category 73 it is interest ing that in the construction of examples of noncommutative quantum principal bundles t brzezin ski and s majid rediscovered the notion of mixed distributive laws under the name of entwining structures 55 for principality a minimal reasonable requirement is that the category of equivariant sheaves on the total space is canonically equivalent via a descent theorem to the category of usual sheaves on the base space it has been shown by v lunts and the second author that in the case of coaction of hopf algebras the relative hopf modules are in very literal sense phrased in terms of sheaves on noncommutative analogue of a simplicial object namely the borel construction equivariant sheaves a summary of that interpretation is treated in 45 and indeed the schneider s theorem for hopf galois extensions and its various generalizations including for the distributive laws are then the descent along torsor theorems surely the natural topology for such theorems in the commutative case is the flat topology while zariski principal bundles are very special flat noncommutative localizations form an analogue of zariski topology in the noncommutative case there are some substantial differences in the formulation of the descent in that case in respect to the case of the usual grothendieck topologies see our survey 44 which we for simplicity ignore in this article still the descent for such a noncommutative topology can be formulated and effectively used in some favorable cases but it appears that the local situation is in such cases usually neither the tensor product nor the free product of the base algebra and the fiber instead the most fre quent case is a special case of hopf galois extensions which is algebraically similar to semidirect products of groups namely the hopf smash product of noncommutative algebras which indeed has many important features of a trivial principal bundle though there exist more than one trivial princi pal bundle in general for example one of the authors has shown 42 that the quantum group analogue of the gauss decomposition induces a local trivialization in the sense of noncommutative ore localizations and smash products of the q deformation of the fibration sln sln b expressed in 12 urs schreiber zoran s koda terms of quantized algebras of functions more generally one can consider morphism e x of noncommutative schemes 33 represented by abelian categories ce cx with an action of a monoidal category m of modules over a hopf algebra together with an atlas of localizations on cx which are compatible in the sense that there is an induced action of the monoidal category on the localizations 45 and then if the localizations are affine then one tests locally if the action is hopf galois or a distributive law analogue of hopf galois at least such cases deserve to be called principal actions and some slight generalizations are not difficult to define moreover one can define associated bundles in some of these situations in the case of coactions of hopf algebras the sections of the associated bundles locally in affine charts boil down to the cotensor product of the type e v where e is the total algebra of the principal bundle and v is a left comodule over the symmetry hopf algebra 42 43 for some reason in the literature there is almost no study of the global algebras of associated bundles but rather most of the spaces of sections in affine case we will address this question in detail in another publication 4 application to hopf algebraic coherent states in the classical case of compact lie groups and some other classcial gen eralizations there is a projective operator valued measure on the space of coherent states cs which integrates to a constant operator on the hilbert space corresponding to a unitary representation of the compact lie group or to a space of sections of certain line bundle over a generalization of the homogenous space from the lie group case the cs are not mutually or thogonal but they still play role in a resolution of unity operator formula if the hilbert space is a playground of some quantum mechanical situation the schro dinger equation can thus be written in cs representation in ad dition cs have a number of special properties perelomov cs minimize generalized covariant uncertainty relations and transform in an appropri ate covariant manner tensor operators of various spin may be treated simultaneously by forming cs operators what is useful for discussing qft on homogeneous spaces i todorov with collaborators 20 37 has been taking advantage of cs in formulating gauged wznw models in hamilto nian formalism but their cs are attached to quantum groups cf 28 for variants of hopf algebras in 2 dcft context whose general and particu larly geometric theory was lacking the open problem was to extend the projective cs measure to the quantum group case existing formulas in simple cases in literature were just formal identities and usually the claimed invariance is incorrect but todorov et al did not develop an appropriate geometric theory of coherent states motivated by 20 37 one of us has shown in 43 that using non commutative localization and gluing one can study the geometry of line bundles over the quantum group homogeneous spaces and express the cor rect algebraic conditions for the analogues of perelomov cs and of the in variant projective cs measure local coordinates on quantum g b are described as a nncommutative principal fibration using categorical picture categorified symmetries 13 with action compatible noncommutative localizations and a smash product picture in charts in practice the construction of coordinates on the quo tient space boils down to gluing of the algebras of localized coinvariants under the localized coaction of quantum borel subgroup bq in coaction compatible localized charts on gq 42 5 higher gauge theories an n groupoid is a n category in which all k cells for all 1 k n are invertible depending on the choice of context this means strictly invertible or weakly invertible i e up to higher cells an n group is a one object n groupoid smooth n group oid s appear as analogues of lie gauge groups for parallel transport along higher dimensional surfaces one can build a theory of bundles with total space which is now replaced by smooth n category possesing local trivialization and differential forms which are analogues of connection forms two torsors of 30 principal bigroupoid 2 bundles of 5 and gerbes 9 are examples the cocycle data of a gerbe may be used to twist usual bundles and constructions with bundles e g to get twisted k theory instead of looking at the total space and differential forms one may instead consider the effect of parallel transport to the points in a typical fiber thus an n bundle with connection gets replaced by trans port n functor from some groupoid corresponding to the path geometry of the underlying space fundamental n groupoid path n groupoid to the symmetry object of the fiber the same formalism may incorporate gluing of hyper covers by replacing the path groupoids with c ech n groupoids of hypercovers corresponding n functors into symmetry n group oid are the appropriate cocycles on the other hand the fiber bundles may be pulled back from the universal bundle over the classifying space of the group the classifying space bg of an n group corresponds to regarding the n group g as a one object n 1 groupoid bg thus in the next few sections we view cocycles as some weak maps into bg in general we find it useful to employ some abstract homotopy theory of a certain model of categories described in section 6 to express what sort of weak maps the cocycles re ally are for more details see 36 we present two collections of definitions one encoding the theory of nonabelian cocycles and bundles in section 7 the other describing aspects of the quantum theory of the corresponding models in section 8 some examples and applications are in section 9 6 categories and homotopy theory while for a long time definitions of categories were notorious for not being ready for showtime recently andre joyal s several decades old sug gestion that there is good 1 category theory with good explicit incar nations in terms of simplicial sets and simplicially enriched categories has been fully realized and now provides a fully fledged context in which to do higher category theory a good deal of the full picture was clarified in 65 building on previous and ongoing work by many authors the reader is referred to this reference for a comprehensive account of most of the tech nical concepts that we will invoke in the following sections notably to the 14 urs schreiber zoran s koda appendix for a survey of category theory simplicially enriched category the ory model category theory and its relation to higher category theory we now try to briefly survey some aspects to provide some kind of indication of the background for the technical discussion to follow 6 1 categories versus model categories this subsection is about the technical point of modelling categories and may be skipped in the first reading a kan complex is a simplicial set whose k cells may be thought of as k morphisms in an groupoid the kan condition ensures that these k morphisms may be composed and have inverses an 1 category is like an groupoid only that the 1 morphisms are not required to be necessarily invertible accordngly there is a slightly weakened version of the kan condition and simplicial sets satisfying that condition were called weak kan complexes by boardman and vogt a joyal fully realized that this is a good model for 1 categories and introduced the term quasicategory 60 for these simplicial sets this is a powerful model in that it allows to use many tools from simplicial homotopy theory for the study of 1 categories a closely related and equivalent incarnation of 1 categories is given by ordinary enriched categories enriched in kan complexes this is a powerful too because it allows to apply many tools from enriched category theory there is an operation called the homotopy coherent nerve which takes a kan complex enriched category to a quasi category in practice this is used to pass back and forth between the two incarnations at will there are other models such as segal categories and complete segal spaces too a particularly powerful additional toolset for presenting and handling 1 categories is the old language of quillen model categories which deals with ordinary categories some of whose morphisms are marked in a way that indicates their hidden 1 categorical origin notably a model category has a singled out class of morphisms called weak equivalences which need not be invertible in the category but are supposed to be equiv alences in the 1 category presented by the model category not all 1 categories arise from model categories but all 1 categories do arise from categories with just weak equivalences 51 every category with weak equivalences determines by a procedure called dwyer kan simplicial localization at these weak equivalences an 1 category and all 1 categories arise this way but if the category with weak equivalences does carry in addition the structure of a simplicial quillen model category then the corresponding 1 category may more easily be expressed as simply the full sset subcategory on all those objects that are marked in the model structure as being fibrant and cofibrant the hom simplicial sets of a simplicial model category are necessarily kan complexes hence groupoids if moreover the model category is com binatorial meaning that there is particularly good control over its cofibra tions then the 1 category obtained this way is locally presentable 65 it is a reflective sub 1 category a localization of an 1 category of 1 presheaves that every presentable 1 category does arise this way from a combinatorial simplical model category is essentially categorified symmetries 15 the dugger s theorem which says that every combinatorial model category arises as the left bousfield localization of the projective model structure on the category of simplicial presheaves on some site precisely if the local ization defining a locally presentable 1 category is exact in that the left adjoint to the inclusion of the reflective subcategory preserves finite limits is the presentable 1 category an 1 topos in that case this left adjoint is stackification and the reflective subcategory is that of stacks 1 sheaves if the localization is what is called topological then these stacks are precisely those presheaves that satisfy descent with respect to c ech nerves given by some grothendieck topology on the underlying category this is the categorical version of the ordinary sheaf condition the topos of stacks on some site c plays the role of the collection of groupoids equipped with geometric structure modeled by c this is discussed in the next section 6 2 generalized spaces topoi and higher categories if the object of a category c play the role of test spaces and their mor phisms behave as geometric homomorphisms between these test spaces then the topos sh c the category of sheaves on c may be understood as the category of generalized spaces modeled on c this is a rephrase of grothendieck s functor of points point of view on geometric spaces by now largely extended by lurie 64 and others some of these generalized spaces are very general all they provide is a consistent rule for how to probe them by throwing test spaces in c into them if c is a concrete site the concrete sheaves on c model such spaces that at least have an underlying topological space of points among these concrete generalized spaces are the tame ones that are locally isomorphic to objects in c for instance for c cartesianspaces cartsp for short the category whose objects are the spaces rn for all n n and whose morphisms are smooth infinitely differentiable maps between these we have a sequence of inclusions cartesianspaces smoothmanifolds diffeologicalspaces sh cartesianspaces representable sheaves locally representable sheaves sheaves with underlying topological space all sheaves where the entire inclusion from left to right is the yoneda embedding here diffeological spaces are sets equipped with a consistent rule for which maps of sets from an rn into them are regarded as being smooth originally defined this way by souriau and chen one sees that more ab stractly speaking these are precisely the concrete sheaves on cartsp 49 those shaves which have an underlying topological space of points for instance for and x two smooth manifolds their mapping space x is naturally a diffeological space which as a sheaf is given by the assignment x u 7 homsmoothmanifolds u x that says that a smooth map from u into x is a smooth u parameterized family of smooth maps from to x 16 urs schreiber zoran s koda from this point of view smooth manifolds are precisely the concrete sheaves on cartsp that are also locally representable but there are also useful generalized spaces modeled on cartsp that are not concrete an example is the space given by the rule u 7 ncl u that sends a cartesian space u to the set of closed smooth n forms on it this may be thought of as a model for an eilenberg maclane space k n r in a useful sense but it is not a concrete space in fact this space only has a single point a single curve a single surface and generally a single k dimensional probe for k n but then it has infinitely many n dimensional probes but the theory of sheaves is not enough for a good discussion of general geometric objects the fully general geometric objects modeled on test objects in a site c have not just a set of ways of mapping a test object u c into them but an groupoid of ways of doing this there is an 1 topos h sh 1 c of groupoid valued sheaves stacks on c if again c cartsp then an groupoid valued sheaf on c is a generalized lie groupoid a locally presentable lie groupoid is an orbifold or a higher generalization of that a convenient model for presenting and manipulating the 1 category sh 1 c is as the full sset enriched subcategory spsh c proj loc of the category spsh c cop sset of simplicial set valued ordinary presheaves on c on those objects which are fibrant cofibrant in what is called the projective local model structure on simplicial presheaves with respect to the given grothendieck topology on c this subcategory is kan complex enriched hence enriched in groupoids hence an 1 category its objects can be thought of as rectified groupoid valued presheaves that satisfy an sheaf stack desccent condition the tools for handling toposes this way go back tokenneth brown s work from 1973 13 they have later been promoted by a joyal and developed further by jardine 59 c simpson d dugger and oth ers with the results of 74 75 65 this toolset has found its intrinsic interpretation in higher category theory the sequence of inclusions of tame generalized spaces into ever more general generalized spaces mentioned above has been realized in 64 for the context of 1 toposes in this context a concrete stack in h is not one with an underlying topological space but one in turn with an underlying petit 1 topos apart from a hierarchy of geometrically more or less tame sheaves of groupoids there is also a hierarchy of categorically more or less tame groupoids to this we turn now 6 3 strict groupoid valued stacks the category of strict groupoids is the limit obtained by recursively forming groupoids strictly enriched in strict n groupoids starting with 0 groupoids sets str grpd lim grpd str 2 grpd grpd grpd str 3 grpd 2 grpd grpd categorified symmetries 17 ross street s nerve functor n str grpd kancplx sset injects strict groupoids into all groupoids one useful aspect of strict groupoids is that they are half way in between homological algebra and topology full groupoid theory there is an equivalence going back to whitehead and amplified by r brown higgins and others of strict groupoids with crossed complexes these are like complexes of abelian groups but may have non abelian groups in low degree and be groupoidal in the lowest degree accordingly ordinary chain complexes of abelian groups in non negative degree in turn sit inside all crossed complexes as the models for the strict and abelian groupoids combined with the nerve this factors the familiar dold kan map ch ab crscpl str grpds n kancplx grpd as a hierarchy of more or less tame groupoids street had also proposed a notion of descent for strict groupoid valued presheaves on a site c in 46 following a conjecture by one of the authors dominic verity has shown 76 that under mild conditions this notion is compatible with the correct notion of descent in cop sset induced by the intrinsic categorical theory under the embedding cop str grpd n cop sset this allows to handle strict groupoid valued stacks on c by themselves as useful special cases of general groupoid valued stacks for instance the higher lie groups known as the string 2 group or the fivebrane 6 group have convenient models as strict n groupoid valued presheaves on c cartsp notice that this is no contradiction to the fact that under the nerve strict groupoids represent only a very restrictive subclass of all homotopy n types as soon as we are speaking about groupoid valued presheaves on some site the geometric realization functor h grpd that we discuss in more detail in section 7 4 will send such an groupoid valued sheaf to an groupoid that combines the geometric homotopy groups encoded in the sheaves in each categorical degree with the cate gorical homotopy groups themselves for instance for c cartsp clearly every homotopy type x grpd is in the image of simply take the categorically discrete and hence strict groupoid valued presheaf whose presheaf of objects is that represented by x 7 nonabelian cohomology higher vector bundles and back ground fields fix now some site c of test spaces and take the ambient context of groupoids modeled on c to be the 1 sheaf 1 topos h sh 1 c as mentioned above this may be presented by the model 18 urs schreiber zoran s koda category structure spsh c proj loc on the functor category func c op sset defined to be the left bousfield localization of the global projective model structure at the set of c ech nerve projections c ui u for ui u i a covering family in c we shall give several of the following definitions both in their intrinsic category theoretic formulation in h and also in terms of the model given by the ordinary category spsh c the latter we shall often refer to just as the model notably for x a two objects of h we may think of a morphism g x a as a cocycle on x with values in a a nonabelian cocycle if a is not an eilenberg maclane object think of a 2 morphism x g g 88 a necessarily an equivalence in the 1 category h as a coboundary and think of the set of equivalence classes of morphisms h x a 0 h x a as the cohomology set of x with coefficients in a this is a group if a is a group object as discussed further below many notions of cohomology ever considered are special cases of this simple definition for suitable choices of c notably for c in which case h grpd top is the archetypical 1 topos does the above notion reduce to the familiar definition of nonabelian cohomology of topological spaces in terms of homotopy classes of maps into suitable coefficient objects it is useful to think of all constructions here as refinements of this case where continuous maps between topological spaces are replaced with richer structure preserving maps such as smooth maps between lie groupoids in terms of the model choosing a fibrant representative for a a cocycle x a is represented by an anafunctor this suggestive terminology for what is of course an old and basic concept in homotopy theory we find useful to adopt from 25 6 from x to a a span g x a x g a x whose left leg is an acyclic fibration which exhibits x as a cover of x or rather as something akin to the c ech groupoid of a cover cocycles are regarded as distinct only up to refinements of their covers this makes categorified symmetries 19 their composition by pullbacks x g a r a g a a r a x g a x well defined noticing that acyclic fibrations are stable under pullback and associative several other simple notions for cohomology in an 1 topos are use ful for c a b a morphism in h we can think of it both as a b cocycle on a and as a characteristic class on a cohomology inducing a morphism of cohomologies h x a h x b natural in x we will later on notably be interested in the curvature characteristic classes of certain coefficient objects given morphisms i x 0 x and k a 0 a we may define the relative cohomology of x with values in a and with respect to i and k as the corresponding hom object in the arrow 1 category hi of our 1 topos h x x 0 a a 0 0 h i x 0 x a 0 a a cocycle in this cohomology is a square x 0 a 0 x a in h commuting up to a 2 morphism there and can always be mod eled by a strictly commuting square in the model this is notably of interest when a is pointed and a 0 is that point then we write just h x x 0 a for the corresponding relative cohomology cocycles in here are a cocycles on x that trivialize when pulled back to x 0 the curvature characteristic class mentioned above arises from cocy cles in such relative cohomology in section 7 4 3 20 urs schreiber zoran s koda given a morphism f b c thought of as a characteristic class let a b denote its homotopy fiber for a given object x choose a rep resentative cocycle for each c cohomology class h x c h x c then we may call the connected components of the homotopy pullback hf x a h x c h x b h x c the f twisted cohomology on x with coefficients in a this we use for defining differential cohomology as curv twisted flat differential cohomology our goal now is to exhibit the following concepts internal to h for x h an groupoid thought of as target space a generalized orbifold and for g an group the gauge group or structure group g and given an 1 category f the category of typical fibers together with a morphism bg f into a pointed codomain ptf pt f which we think of as a representation of g we can speak of g cocycles g on g the g principal bundle p g eg on x classified by these the associated bundles v g ef the collection v of sections of v connections on the g principal bundle p except for the last one the definition of these notions follows pretty much classical lore in homotopy theory only that we work not necessarily in the traditional archetypical 1 topos grpd top but in h this allows us to speak with ease for instance about the differential geometry of smooth bnu 1 principal bundles otherwise known as n 1 bundle gerbes or smooth nonabelian structures such as string principal 2 bundles but all constructions here work for arbitrary sites c up to section 7 4 where connections on bundles are introduced and special properties in the site are required 7 1 principal bundles definition 7 1 group given a one object groupoid bg h the pullback g bg categorified symmetries 21 is the corresponding group in terms of the model for bg a fibrant representative this may be identified with the ordinary pullback g bg i d 0 d 1 pt bg bg where i 0 1 is the categorical interval for g an group a g principal bundle p x can be defined intrin sically in h simply as the categorical fiber of a morphism x bg as we shall do shortly in terms of the model for h this simple statement requires introducing the universal g principal bundle which we now do first definition 7 2 universal g principal bundle for bg a fibrant representative in the model the universal g principal bundle eg bg is given by the ordinary pullback eg pt bg i d 1 d 0 bg bg lemma 7 3 the morphism eg bg defined this way is indeed a fibration and its kernel is g we have a short exact sequence g i eg p bg proof this is a standard fact in homotopy theory but maybe deserves to be highlighted here in the context of principal bundles in h that p is a fibration is the factorization lemma 13 to see that g is indeed the kernel of this fibration consider the diagram g eopg pt eg bgi d 1 d 0 bg pt bg 22 urs schreiber zoran s koda the right and bottom squares are pullback squares by definition moreover g is by definition 7 1 the total pullback g d dd dd dd d pt bgi d 1 d 0 bg pt bg therefore also the top left square exists and is a pullback itself and hence so is the pasting composite of the two top squares this says that i is the kernel of p definition 7 4 g principal bundles for x h and g h an group and for g x bg a g cocycle on x the corresponding homo topy fiber p x i e the pullback p x g bg is the g principal bundle classified by g in terms of the model for h the cocycle is given by an anafunctor x oooo x g bg and the cor responding g principal bundle g p x classified by g is given by the ordinary pullback diagram g eg eg x g bg x for n 2 this way of describing universal principal n bundles was de scribed in 32 if g is a group or strict 2 group this definition of g principal bundles is equivalent to the definitions in 6 5 48 of course this statement involves higher categorical equivalences for g a 2 group and g x bg a cocycle the pullback g eg is a priori a 2 groupoid whereas in the literature on 2 bundles one expects this total space categorified symmetries 23 to be a 1 groupoid but this desired 1 groupoid is obtained by dividing out 2 isomorphisms in g eg and the result is weakly equivalent to the original 2 groupoid g eg g eg principal bundles and line bundle gerbes for every ordinary lie group g i e a one object lie groupoid bg in h sh 1 cartsp there is a 2 group aut g i e a one object lie 2 groupoid baut g in h defined as the internal automorphism 2 group the notion of g gerbe introduced by giraud corresponds to the notion of aut g principal 2 bundle as described here for g u 1 we have that baut u 1 is the 2 groupoid given by the crossed complex u 1 0 z 2 where z 2 acts on u 1 by automorphisms a aut u 1 principal 2 bundle is what in the literature has been called a jandl gerbe if one assumes that the z 2 part of a aut u 1 cocycle is trivial one arrives at a plain bu 1 principal 2 bundle in h if a cocycle for these is written down in a certain form this is what in the literature is called a bundle gerbe similarly a cocycle for a b 2 u 1 principal 3 bundle in our sense written down in a certain way is called a bundle 2 gerbe generally therefore for n n we may think of certain representative cocycles for bnu 1 principal bundles as bundle n gerbes not all higher principal bundles that appear in practice are of this abelian form but by local semi trivialization many cocycles for nonabelian g principal bundles may be realized as abelian principal bundles on total spaces of nonabelian principal n bundles for lower n for let ba bg bg be a fibration sequence in h then consider the diagram in h of the form g p g p ba x x g bg bg where every single square and hence all rectangles are pullback squares this exhibits p x as the total space of the g principal bundle clas sified by g but the diagram shows that this is encoded in an a principal bundle on the total space p of the underlying g principal bundle satisfying the special property that its restriction to any fiber presents the cocycle that exhibts the extension g g if a is an abelian group then this construction allows to speak of the possibly nonabelian g principal bundle p only in terms of abelian co cycles on p this is for instance the case for string n principal 2 bundles 24 urs schreiber zoran s koda the 2 group string n is defined by the fibration sequence b 2 u 1 bstring n bspin n 1 2 p 1 b 3 u 1 hence a string principal 2 bundle may equivalently be encoded by a certain bundle gerbe on the total space of the underlying spin n principal bundle these structures appear in the background of the heterotic string see 69 for a survey similarly using now the fiber sequence b 2 u 1 baut u 1 bz we find that aut 1 principal 2 bundles are the same as bundle gerbes on certain double covers these structures model the kalb ramond field on an orbifold in string theory 7 2 associated bundles for many aspects of quantum theory it is crucial to pass from principal bun dles to associated vector bundles for instance the electromagnetic field on a space x is entirely encoded in a u 1 principal bundle p x with connection but to form the spaces of quantum states of the quantum particle that is charged under this field one passes to the associated line bundle e p u 1 c a rank 1 vector bundle of the principal bundle and then forms the space of sections of that this space of linear sections in turn may be understood as the collection of morphisms x c e from the trivial line bundle into e here it is important this this mor phism is not required to be an isomorphism but a general morphism in the category vect x of vector bundles over x this means that for the quantum theory it is crucial to generalize from groupoid valued stacks to category valued stacks and hence from groupoid valued stacks to 1 category valued stacks and to realize associated bundles in terms of these this is what we formalize now while there is no good general intrinsic theory of 2 toposes of 1 category valued stacks available yet it is pretty clear what the 1 category of 1 category valued stacks should be let sset be the model structure on marked simplicial sets in troduced in 65 which provides a simplicial model structure that models quasi categories then define the 1 category of 1 category valued stacks on c to be as before the left bousfield localization of the global projective model structure func cop sset at c ech nerves of covering fam ilies in the following by 1 category over c we shall mean an object in this left bousfield localization so let f be some 1 category over c in this sense not necessarily an groupoid which will play the role of the stack vect of ordinary vector bundles an anafunctor bg f categorified symmetries 25 may be thought of as an group cocycle with values in f if f is equipped with a point pt ptf f we may think of such a morphism also as a representation of g in analogy with the universal g principal bundle from definition 7 2 we obtain the universal f bundle with respect to the chosen point ptf as a pullback from the point definition 7 5 universal f bundle for f an 1 category with cho sen point ptf f the universal f bundle ef f is the pullback ef ptf f i d 0 d 1 f f here i 0 1 crucially still denotes the category free on a single nontrivial morphisms not the groupoid this means that an object in f i is not in general an invertible morphism in f definition 7 6 associated f bundle given a representation morphism bg f we call the lax comma pullback ef bg f which for f a fibrant representative in the model is given as the ordinary pullback ef ef b g f bg the f bundle associated to the universal g bundle correspondingly the further pullback along a g cocycle 26 urs schreiber zoran s koda g ef ef x g bg f which is modeled by the sequence of ordinary pullbacks g ef ef ef x g b g f x is the f bundle associated to the specific g principal bundle g eg the pullback v in v ef ef b g f is the representation space itself the typical fiber of the associated bun dles 7 3 sections of associated bundles definition 7 7 section a section of a associated bundle v g ef coming from a cocycle x g bg is a lift of the cocycle through ef bg or equivalently a morphism from the trivial f bundle with fiber ptf to v v ef x g x x x x bg x id pt ptf a aa aa aa x g f 1 zzz zz zzzz z categorified symmetries 27 lemma 7 8 these two characterizations of sections are indeed equivalent proof first rewrite x g pt ptf c cc cc cc c bg f rr rr pt ptf f x g c cc cc cc c f i d 0 oo d 1 bg f using the characterization of right directed homotopies by the directed path object f i using the universal property of ef as a pullback this yields ef x g 66 llllllll bg f ef x g x x x x bg 7 4 connections on bundles a gauge background field is crucially not just an bundle but an bundle with connection the connection encodes the forces acting on the objects that are charged under the background field its parallel transport enters the action functional for these objects the underlying bundle only encodes the global nontriviality of this parallel transport while the crucial local physical information is in the connection in low categorical dimension n following an original suggestion by john baez see 50 for an exposition and 40 41 for details it is by now well known that the n connection is in fact equivalent to the parallel trans port n functor on the path n groupoid that it induces in 70 the full categorical formulation of this phenomenon was indicated with empha sis on lie differential geometric aspects we now discuss this with more emphasis on some general abstract properties that we need for our exam ples in section 9 a comprehensive discussion is to appear elsewhere see 71 7 4 1 the homotopy groupoid to obtain the functor that sends each object x h to its path groupoid x we shall now observe that in nice cases this is defined canonically 1 1 u s thanks richard williamson for useful discussion of this point it turns out that in some disguise and up to some issues this is almost a classical fact but 28 urs schreiber zoran s koda theorem 7 9 let c be a site whose objects are geometrically contractible in that kan complex valued presheaves on c satisfy descent for simplicial presheaves on objects of c then h sh 1 c is a locally contractible 1 topos in that the terminal global sections geomet ric morphism h grpd is essential i e in that we have a triple of adjoint 1 functors lconst h oo lconst grpd this is the case notably for the site c cartsp with covering families given by ordinary covers that are good covers all intersections of patches are contractible in this case we have moreover lconst lconst id id grpd grpd remark the last statement means that the shape of the locally con tractible 1 topos sh 1 cartsp in the sense of shape theory of 1 toposes 65 is that of the point this highlights the fact that sh 1 cartsp is a gros 1 topos of all spaces modeled on cartsp rather than something that is to be thought of as a generalized topological space itself we may indeed usefully think of the objects in cartsp as noth ing but thickened points n dimensional disks that only serve to encode the notion of smooth families around a given point useful comments along these lines can be found in 56 proof for the first statement it is sufficient to produce a quillen ad junction lconst spsh c proj loc oo lconst ssetquillen with the underlying functor of lconst simply being the constant presheaf functor almost by definition that has an sset enriched left adjoint given by sending a presheaf to its colimit since lconst evidently sends acyclic fibrations in ssetquillen to acyclic fibrations in the global model struc ture spsh c proj it follows that lim spsh c proj ssetquillen preserves cofibrations but the cofibrations do not change under left bousfield local ization so that also lim spsh c proj loc ssetquillen preserves cofi brations moreover by assumption lconst ssetquillen spsh c proj loc preserves fibrant objects noticing that ssetquillen is a left proper model lifting the disguise and making the abstract 1 topos theoretic structure manifest turns out to be very useful for a detailed commented review and more literature see http ncatlab org nlab show homotopy groups in an infinity 1 topos http ncatlab org nlab show homotopy groups in an infinity categorified symmetries 29 category this means that the conditions of corollary a 3 7 2 in 65 are sat isfied which says that lim lconst is indeed a quillen adjunction for the local model structure on spsh c as stated to see that the site cartsp does satisfy the required assumptions let ui u be a good cover of u cartsp and write c ui n n i 0 in ui 0 in for the corresponding c ech nerve regarded as simplicial presheaf then for s a kan complex we have spsh c ui lconst s spsh n n i 0 in ui 0 in lconsts n i 0 in spsh ui 0 in lconsts n i 0 in sset lconsts sset n n i 0 in s which is a kan complex weakly equivalent to s since the simplicial set coming from the cover is a contractible kan complex since u cartsp is topologically contractible so the morphism s spsh u lconst s spsh c ui lconst s is a weak equivalence which means that lconst s satisfies descent similarly we have that the right adjoint to the constant simplicial presheaf functor lim spshproh loc ssetquillen preserves fibrant objects and that lconst also preserves cofibrations since the point r 0 is cofibrant and tensoring with a simplicial set sends cofibrant presheaves to cofibrant presheaves since also spsh c proj loc is left proper being the left bous field localization of a functor category with values in a left proper model category corollary a 3 7 2 in 65 applies again to show that we have a triple of quillen adjoint functors lconst spsh c proj loc ssetquillen by the above discussion lconst idsset and lconst idsset are evidently composites of derived functors which proves the last claim remark topological geometric realization the colimit over a rep resentable presheaf is the singleton set by 56 every object x 30 urs schreiber zoran s koda spsh c proj has a cofibrant replacement x that is degreewise a coprod uct of representables uin c x n n in uin this means that the 1 functor modeled by sends such x to the kan fibrant re placement of the simplicial set obtained by contracting in this expression each representable to a point x n n in in particular for c cartsp andx a manifold the simplicial set x is under the quillen equivalence ssetquillen top a topological space that is weakly homotopy equivalent to x so we may think of h grpd top as being a topological geometric realization of structured objects in h to plain topological spaces up to weak homotopy equivalence indeed by proposition 2 8 in 56 the cofibrant replacement of a sim plicial presheaf x may be taken to be of the form x n n x n with x n a replacement of the simplicially discrete presheaf xn this is sent by to the topological space n n x n which is the geometric realization of the simplicial topological space x obtained by geometrically realizing x in each degree so again in our running example of c cartsp we find in particu lar that if x is a simplicial manifold or simplicial diffeological space then x is up to weak homotopy equivalence the familiar topological geo metric realization of x the fact alone that the path groupoid functor is part of an essential geometric morphism of 1 toposes lconst leads to some useful general statements about the geometric homotpy groups of objects in h definition 7 10 write core grpd for the groupoid of small groupoids define cov h lconst core grpd h grpd for x h we call cov x the groupoid of covering spaces over x theorem 7 11 galois theory let h be a locally contractible 1 topos we have naturally in x h the following statements covering spaces correspond to local systems cov x func x grpd for each point x x in the geometric realization of x the automorphism group of the induced fiber functor fx cov x grpd is equivalent to the geometric homotopy groups x x aut x op x of x at x aut fx x x categorified symmetries 31 proof the first statement is simply the hom equivalence corresponding to the 1 adjunction lconst cov x h x lconst core grpd grpd x core grpd func x grpd the second fact is abstract tannaka duality a formal consequence of apply ing the 1 yoneda lemma four times in a row the fiber functor fx func x x func x grpd grpd may itself be re garded as an 1 presheaf by the 1 yoneda lemma for the 1 yoneda embedding j x op psh 1 x op this is equivalently fx hompsh 1 x op j x but this means that fx j j x is it self a representable 1 presheaf an object in psh 1 psh 1 x op op the statement then follows from applying the 1 yoneda lemma two more times aut fx aut j j x aut j x aut x op x x x where we suppressed some evident subscripts for readability 7 4 2 the geometric path groupoid we now want to obtain a notion of path groupoid internal to h for that we use the above adjunction to reflect the homotopy groupoid back into h definition 7 12 for h a locally contractible 1 topos write lconst lconst h h for the composite adjunction we call the path groupoid functor while entirely abstractly defined it turns out that the path groupoid functor does induce an intrinsic notion of geometric paths in h we make this explicit for c cartsp with the following statement theorem 7 13 for c cartsp in the model cop sset the functor is equivalently given by the left quillen functor which is the left derived yoneda extension r of the smooth singular simplicial complex functor c cop sset u 7 u r where r is the canonical cosimplicial object exhibiting the geometric smooth n simplex 32 urs schreiber zoran s koda proof choose a functorial factorization u f ff ff ff ff r u u r in spsh c proj of the evident inclusion u u r notice that since the representable u is cofibrant in spsh c proj loc also r u is cofibrant for general x spsh c we then set r x u c r u x u here the coend over the tensoring of spsh c over sset c spsh c proj inj c op sset proj spsh c proj is a left quillen bifunctor by proposition a 2 26 and remark a 2 27 of 65 since by construction r regarded as an object in c spsh c proj inj is cofibrant this means that r u c r u u preserves cofibrations and acyclic cofibrations moreover this r extends to an sset enriched functor and as such has an sset enriched right adjoint r x 7 spsh r x therefore r r spsh c proj oo spsh c proj is a quillen adjunction for the global model structure it remains to show that this descends to a quillen adjunction on the local model structure for this notice that r sends projections c ui u of good covers ui u out of c ech nerves of good covers to weak equivalences this is because using that r u is a global weak equivalence for u cartsp and that the c ech nerve is cofibrant we have n i 0 in r ui 0 in n n i 0 in n r c ui n i 0 in r ui 0 in n n i 0 in n where sset n 7 n n op is the bousfield kan cofibrant replacement of and of in sset proj and we use again that all coends over tensors here are quillen bifunctors and finally on the right that u is topologically contractible categorified symmetries 33 from this we can now conclude that r preserves fibrant objects in spsh c proj loc this is because the fibrant objects in the left bousfield localization are the globally fibrant objects that satisfy descent on all c ech nerves of good covers as above and since both c ui as well as u and therefore also r c i and of course r u are cofibrant in spsh c proj loc we have by adjunction that spsh c ui u r a spsh r c ui r u a is the enriched hom of a weak equivalence between cofibrant objects into a fibrant object in the simplically enriched model category spsh c proj and so is itself a weak equivalence in ssetquillen but this says that r a satisfies descent again by appeal to corollary a 3 7 2 in 65 we therefore have the desired local quillen adjunction r r spsh c proj loc oo spsh c proj loc it remains to show that the functor modeled by r i e its left derived functor is indeed equivalent to the abstractly defined this fol lows again using dugger s cofibrant replacement theorem and the remarks about geometric realization in section 7 4 1 forx a simplicial presheaf and r x n n in r uin the value of the left derived functor of r this is related by a zig zag of weak equivalences as in the diagram above to n n in lconst lconst x x remark the groupoid r x may be thought of as generated in degree n from the n k dimensional smooth paths in the smooth space of k morphisms of x the unit of the adjunction x x identifies x as the object of constant paths inside x in low categorical degree a very explicit description of r x for x a diffeological c ech groupoid is given in 41 there it is also discussed how morphism out of r x encode connections on higher principal bundles and nonabelian gerbes on x this aspect we describe now in the full abstract generality of a locally contractible 1 topos h 7 4 3 differential cocycles and connections with the path groupoid availalable it is immediate to say what a flat connection on a principal bundle is a local system as seen by in cases where the obstruction to flatness is measured suitably by some char acteristic class curv the curvature we can define non flat connections as cocycles in the curv twisted cohomology of throughout now h is assumed to be a locally contractible 1 topos notice that the units and counits of the adjunctions lconst induce canonical natural morphisms 34 urs schreiber zoran s koda x x and a a definition 7 14 for g x bg a cocycle with corresponding g principal bundle p x we say that an extension x bg in x g bg x wwwwwwwww is a flat connection on p with underlying cocycle g if the underlying cocycle is trivial then we call a corresponding flat connection a flat closed g valued differential forms datum bgdr u 7 h i u u bg for the sheaf of closed g valued differential forms where hi is the arrow 1 category of h we now turn to the discussion of general not necessarily flat connection connections on principal bundles of the full theory we here just treat the special case where g is braided meaning that a bg is itself a group object with one further delooping ba the general theory is discussed elsewhere 71 a simple but important example to keep in mind is g bnu 1 in which case ba bn 2 u 1 theorem 7 15 for h a locally contractible 1 topos and a h a group object we have a fiber sequence a a curv badr this means that for g x a a given cocycle the obstruction to lifting it to a flat differential cocycle x a which by adjunction corresponds to x a is precisely the nontriviality of its curv characteristic class x a badr definition 7 16 a differential cocycle refining a cocycle g x bg or equivalently a connection on the g principal bundle p x classified categorified symmetries 35 by g is a cocycle in curv twisted a cohomology i e in the pullback hcurv x bg in hcurv x bg f h x b 2 gdr h x bg h x b 2 gdr where h x b 2 gdr 0 h x b 2 gdr is the set of g valued de rham cohomology classes and the right vertical morphism is a choice of cocycle representative for each class for a differential cocycle we call the underlying cocycle and f its curvature characteristic class theorem 7 17 in the model for h a differential cocycle connection on x is given by a fixed cofibrant replacement y x of x and a diagram y g bg y ebg such that the composite morphism in f y ebg b 2 g equals the corresponding curvature de rham cocycle a morphism between such cocyles is a commuting diagram y g 1 g 2 bg y 1 2 ebg in the sset enriched category cop sset that keeps the curvature fixed in that y 1 2 ebg b 2 g f 1 f 2 y b 2 g 36 urs schreiber zoran s koda given a differential cocycle g and a representation bg f the total space e g f of the corresponding associated f bundle is accompanied by its action groupoid e with respect to the action of the paths in the base on the fibers under the connection definition 7 18 the groupoid e associated in the model to a given differential cocycle g is the pullback e ef y ebg f bgebg this fits canonically into a commuting diagram e e y y in the model we can also consider applying to objects that are not smooth groupoids but smooth 1 categories notably if is a causal lorentzian manifold then this may naturally be regarded as a smooth poset a smooth category with exactly none or one morphism between every ordered pair 1 2 of points one if 2 is in the future of 1 none otherwise then is a smooth 1 category whose morphisms are generated from spacelike paths in and timelike jumps and whose 2 morphisms are gen erated from those of the form 1 1 2 77 2 where horzontal morphism are given by spacelike paths and are invert ible while the vertical 1 morphisms are given by future directed jumps and are non invertible 8 quantization and quantum symmetries we want to think of an associated bundle e x with connection as a background field a generalization of an electromagnetic field on x to which a higher dimensional fundamental brane such as a particle a string or a membrane propagating onx may couple if a piece of worldvolume of this fundamental brane is modeled by an 1 category then following for instance 16 we want to say that categorified symmetries 37 the space of fields over is c hom x the object of maps from the worldvolume to target space x the space of states over is the space of sections v of the back ground field v transgressed to the space of fields the quantum time propagation along a piece of worldvolume in out is given by pull push of sections through the span in x x out x weighted by the parallel transport of over the path integral we now try to give this a precise meaning 8 1 background field and space of states definition 8 1 a background structure for a model is an groupoid x h called target space an group g called the gauge group a g principal bundle p x with a connection called the background gauge field a representation called the background matter content then for a smooth 1 category to be called parameter space or worldvolume we say x is the extended configuration space an action functional is a connection on a associated vector bundle on x whose restriction to x is e called the gauge interaction part of the action whereas the part depending on is called the kinetic action 8 2 transgression of cocycles to mapping spaces following 40 we identify transgression to mapping spaces with the internal hom applied to cocycles definition 8 2 transgression of cocycles for x g f a cocycle classifying a associated bundle on x and for any other groupoid we say that the transgression g of g to x is its value under the pointed internal hom in h g hom g hom x hom f 38 urs schreiber zoran s koda 8 3 branes and bibranes from the second part of definition 7 7 one sees that spaces of states being spaces of sections are given by certain morphisms between background fields pulled back to spans correspondences of target spaces from the diagrammatics this has an immediate generalization which leads to the notion of branes and bibranes definition 8 3 branes and bibranes a brane for a background struc ture x g is a morphism q x equipped with a section of the background field pulled back to q i e a transformation q pt ptf x g f v q qqq more generally given two background structures x g and x g a bibrane between them is a span q x x equipped with a transforma tion q x g x g f v r rrr bibranes may be composed fused along common

such as to produce a monoidal structure on bibranes on q consider therefore a category q s t x internal to groupoids equivalently a monad in the bicategory of spans internal to groupoids categorified symmetries 39 with composition operation the morphism of spans q t s q zzuuu uu i iii i comp q s t jjj jj j q stt t yyttt t x x x q s iirrrrrrrrrr t 66 llllllllll definition 8 4 monoidal structure on bibranes given an internal category as above and given an f cocycle g x f the composite of two bibranes q x g x g f uu uuuu v w uu uuuu on q is the result of first forming their composite bibrane on on q t s q and then pushing that forward along comp v w comp s v t w here for finite cases which we concentrate on push forward is taken to be the right adjoint to the pullback in a proper context remarks notice that branes are special cases of bibranes and that bibrane composition restricts to an action of bibranes on branes also recall that the sections of a cocycle on x are the same as the branes of this cocycle for idx the idea of bibranes was first formulated in 18 in the language of modules for bundle gerbes we show in section 9 5 how this is reproduced within the present formulation 8 4 quantum propagation for bg f a representation the corresponding representation space v is in applications typically equipped with a bimonoidal structure v given a sufficiently tame groupoid v over v we may think of it under groupoid cardinality as presenting a linear combination in v where each element in v is weighted by the groupoid cardinality of the fiber above it in this way groupoids over v are a way of presenting linear combinations in v without actually computing these in particular they may not converge in any sense since the typical fiver of a associated bundle is v similarly an groupoid e over e may be thought of as representing a a section of e that may possibly be very singular 40 urs schreiber zoran s koda for in out a piece of worldvolume with specified action functional exp s e qq qqq q ef id qq qqq qq eexp s ef x qq qq f qq qqq q x exp s f bgebg rr rrr rr consider the corresponding span hom in in e eexp s hom e eexp s hom out out e eexp s then the pull push of groupoids through the bottom part we may regard as modelling the quantum propagation along 9 examples and applications we start with some simple applications to illustrate the formalism and then exhibit some maybe interesting aspects in the context low dimensional or finite group qft 9 1 ordinary vector bundles let g be an orinary group hence a 1 group and denote by f vect the 1 category of vector spaces over some chosen ground field k a linear representation of g on a vector space v is indeed the same thing as a functor bg vect which sends the single object of bg to v the canonical choice of point ptf pt vect is the ground field k re garded as the canonical 1 dimensional vector space over itself using this we find from definition 7 5 that the universal vect bundle is evect vect the category of pointed vector spaces with vect vect the canon ical forgetful functor using this one finds from definition 7 6 that the associated vector bundle to the universal g bundle is v g bg where v g v g p 1 v is the action groupoid of g acting on v the weak quotient of v by g categorified symmetries 41 for g x g bg a cocycle describing a g principal bundle and for v the corresponding associated vector bundle according to definition 7 6 one sees that sections v in the sense of definition 7 7 are precisely sections of v in the ordinary sense 9 2 the charged quantum particle in this section we indicate how the familiar path integral quantization of the electromagnetically charged quantum particle arises from the general discussion we will here fall short of attemptig to discuss the measure on paths with respect to which the integral is done while this is arguably the crucial technical point of making sense of the path integral it may still be of interest to see here how just the underly structure of the path integral arises the background field for the charged particle that we consider is the electromagnetic field the data involved is the target space x a smooth manifold the gauge group g u 1 a choice of representation bg v ectc taken to be the canonical representation on v c the background field given by a u 1 principal bundle p x classified by a cocycle g x bu 1 in h which in the model is given by an anafunctor x y bu 1 a connection on this bundle which in the model is given by a diagram y g bu 1 y ebu 1 and whose field strength is given by the composite f y ebu 1 b 2 u 1 in 40 a realization of this setup on terms of smooth strict 2 groupoids is given it is shown there in particualr that such differential cocycles g correspond precisely to ordinary line bundles with connection y may be chosen to be the c ech 2 groupoid induced from a good cover ui x g is a transition function c ech cocycle gij c ui uj u 1 with respect to this cover encodes the parallel transport of the correspondingly the local differential form data ai 1 u 1 and f is the parallel surface 42 urs schreiber zoran s koda transport of the corresponding curvature 2 form f 2 x which here in the physical model is the electromagnetic field strength tensor inspection shows that the corresponding action groupoid eexp s can be characterized as objects are triples x v with x x and v a vector in the fiber of e over x morphisms x v x v correspond to paths 0 1 x from x to x such that evaluating the action on this path takes v to v consider a delta section of e given by the terminal groupid e over e that picks one vector v in the fiber ex over a point x for t 1 t 2 an interval the pull push of this through the bottom part of the span in section 8 4 produces over the fiber v of e over y the 0 truncated groupoid which over v is the set of those paths from x to y whose action takes v to v if everything were suitably finite the decategorification of this v colored set would then indeed yield the familiar expression y x y exp skin tra x for the path integral of the charged particle 9 3 group algebras and category algebras from bibrane monoids in its simplest version the notion of monoidal bibranes from section 8 3 reproduces the notion of category algebra k c of a category c hence also that of a group algebra k g of a group g recall that the category algebra k c of c is defined to have as underlying vector space the linear span of c 1 k c spank c 1 where the product is given on generating elements f g c 1 by f g g f if the composite exists 0 otherwise to reproduce this as a monoid of bibranes in the sense of section 8 3 take the category of fibers in the sense of section 7 2 to be f vect as in section 9 1 consider on the space set of objects c 0 the trivial line bundle given as an f cocycle by i c 0 pt ptk vect an element in the monoid of bibranes for this trivial line bundle on the span given by the source and target map c 1 s t a a c 0 c 0 is a transformation of the form c 1 s xxx t ff f c 0 i gg g c 0 i www vect v vv vv vvvv in terms of its components this is canonically identified with a function v c 1 k from the space set of morphisms to the ground categorified symmetries 43 field and every such function gives such a transformation this identifies the c bibranes with functions on c 1 given two such bibranes v w their product as bibranes is according to definition 8 4 the push forward along the composition map on c of the function on the space set of composable morphisms c 1 t s c 1 k f g 7 v f w g this push forward is indeed the product operation on the category algebra 9 4 monoidal categories of graded vector spaces from bibrane monoids the straightforward categorification of the discussion of group algebras in section 9 3 leads to bibrane monoids equivalent to monoidal categories of graded vector spaces let now f 2 vect be a model for the 2 category of 2 vector spaces for our purposes and for simplicity it is sufficient to take f bvect 2 vect the 2 category with a single object vector spaces as morphims with composition being the tensor product and linear maps as 2 morphisms this can be regarded as the full sub 2 category of 2 vect on 1 dimensional 2 vector spaces and we can assume bvect to be strictified then bibranes over g for the trivial 2 vector bundle on the point i e transformations of the form g ww w g gg pt g gg pt www bvect 0 yyy y yyyy canonically form the category vectg of g graded vector spaces the fusion of such bibranes reproduces the standard monoidal structure on vectg 9 5 twisted vector bundles the ordinary notion of a brane in string theory is for an abelian gerbe g on target space x a map q x and a pu n principal bundle on q whose lifting gerbe for a lift to a u n bundle is the pulled back gerbe g equivalently a twisted u n bundle on q whose twist is g equivalently a gerbe module for g we show how this is reproduced as a special case of the general notion of branes from definition 8 3 see also 41 the bundle gerbe on x is given by a cocycle g x bbu 1 the co efficient group has a canonical representation b 2 u 1 f bvect 44 urs schreiber zoran s koda 2 vect on 2 vector spaces as in section 9 4 given by id id c u 1 7 c c c see also 41 38 by inspection one indeed finds that branes in the sense of diagrams q www ww g gg gg pt ptf h hh h

bundle on the cover encoded by the transformation v the above naturality diagram says that its transition function gtw satisfies the usual cocycle condition for a bundle only up to the twist given by the gerbe g if y x is a cover by open subsets y iui then the above diagram is equivalent to the familiar equation gtw ij gtw jk gtw ik gijk in this functorial cocyclic form twisted bundles on branes were described in 39 41 9 6 dijkgraaf witten theory dijkgraaf witten theory 17 is the model which in our terms is specified by the following data the target space x bg is the one object groupoid corresponding to a finite ordinary group g categorified symmetries 45 the background field bg b 3 u 1 is ab 2 u 1 principal 3 bundle on bg classified by a group 3 cocycle on g more in detail for g a finite group let bg grpd be the correspond ing bare one object groupoid then we may identify bg lconstbg from purely formal manipulations with the adjunctions in our locally con tractible 1 topos of smooth groupoids using theorem 7 9 we find that bg lconstbg lconst lconstbg lconstbg bg which simply reflects the fact that there are no non constant paths in the discrete bg then from definition 7 14 it follows that every principal bundle on such bg uniquely carries a flat connection in this sense the cocycle bg b 3 u 1 is indeed already the full background gauge field for some manifold a field configuration of the dw model is a mor phism bg in h again just formally using the adjunction lconst we find that this is equivalent to a morphism bg by the remark below theorem 7 9 we learn that field configurations for the dw model on smooth manifolds correspond to topological g principal bundles on the underlying topological space i e simply to ordinary g principal bundles on x of course the same can be seen also immediately in compo nents by modelling x bg by an anafunctor out of the c ech nerve of a good cover 9 6 1 the 3 cocycle to understand the 3 cocycle and its transgression that we discuss later on we make explicit what bg looks like 1 morphisms element elements of g 2 morphisms are triangles of the frm h hg g 3 morphisms are tetrahedra of the form h k g oo hg khg 88 8

what it looks like in low degrees if however we think of bg as being a strict groupoid then we need to consider the strict 4 groupoid which is generated from k morphisms as indicated above modulo the relation that every 5 simplex built from these 4 simplices commutes this gives a strict 4 groupoid equivalent to the familiar one object groupoid corresponding to g the functor bg b 3 u 1 has to send the generating 3 morphisms g h k to a 3 morphism in b 3 u 1 which is an element g h k u 1 in addition it has to map the generating 4 morphisms between pasting diagrams of these 3 morphisms to 4 morphisms in b 3 u 1 since there are only identity 4 morphisms in b 3 u 1 and since composition of 3 morphisms in b 3 u 1 is just the product in u 1 this says that has to satisfy the equations g h k l g g h k g kh l h k l hg k l g h lk in u 1 this identifies the functor with a group 3 cocycle on g con versely every group 3 cocycle gives rise to such an functor and one can categorified symmetries 47 check that coboundaries of group cocycles correspond precisely to transfor mations between these functors for the strict groupoid picture notice that uniquely extends to the additional formal inverses

the cocycle as claimed 9 6 3 the drinfeld double modular tensor category from dw bibranes let again b 2 u 1 2 vect be the representation of bu 1 from section 9 4 and let bz g b 2 u 1 be the 2 cocycle obtained in section 9 6 2 from transgression of a dijkgraaf witten line 3 bundle on bg and consider the the associated 2 vector bundle bz corresponding to that its sections according to definition 7 7 form a category bz categorified symmetries 49 corollary 9 2 the category bz is canonically isomorphic to the representation category of the twisted drinfeld double of g proof follows by inspection of our definition of sections applied to this case and using the relation established in 9 6 2 between nonabelian cocycles and the ordinary appearance of the drinfeld double in the literature a section

chern simons theory which is defined for a lie group g and a certain bundle gerbe on g in 1 topos language this can be made precise in that both theories at least as far as their classical formulation goes which is fully understood are literally defined on the same type of data only that the extra structure on g differs which is a difference that the abstract structure of h takes care of automatically in both cases the target space object is x bg in h and the back ground gauge field is a b 2 u 1 principal 3 bundle with connection given by a differential cocycle bg b 3 u 1 bg eb 3 u 1 as in section 7 4 we had seen that in the dijkgraaf witten case of finite g this general statement reduces to the much simpler statement that the background field is already determined by the morphism bg b 3 u 1 which moreover in this case is nothing but a bare group 3 cocycle on g with coefficients in u 1 but the very same morphism bg b 3 u 1 is something much richer in the case that g is a genuine lie group there are various ways to characterize this morphism in terms of a concrete model one way to think of it is as a g equivariant bundle 2 gerbe on the point a bundle gerbe on g with some extra structure and properties similarly the differential cocycle by unwinding what a morphism r bg b 3 u 1 is in the model one finds that it can for instance be given by a degree 4 class in the complex of differential forms on the simplicial manifold g g g that is given by a certain 3 form on g and a 2 form on g g satisfying some relation details of this using explicit models in terms of bundle gerbes have been worked out by various authors see for instance 77 for a good account then for a piece of cobordism a field configuration for the chern simons quantum field theory is a morphism in hi from to bg bg this defines on the differential cocycle bg b 3 u 1 bg eb 3 u 1 for 3 dimensional its volume holonomy is the familiar chern simons action one way to see this is by differentially approximating the lie categorified symmetries 51 groups involved here by their corresponding lie algebras l algebras one passes from this diagram to a corresponding diagram of dg algebras if p is the ordinary g principal bundle classified by this is vert p ooavert oo ce g oo oo ce b 2 u 1 oo p oo a fa w g oo cs p w b 2 u 1 where g is the lie algebra of g ce g its chevalley eilenberg algebra w g

form a on p this differential approximation to the differential chern simons cocycle in h is discussed in 35 a full account shall be given elsewhere 10 conclusion we discussed that symmetries assembled into categories and higher ana logues allow for a systematic and uniform treatment of many phenomena in noncommutative geometry geometry and physics the emphasis has been on monoidal categories acting on categories of sheaves in nc geometry and on higher cocycles for smooth groupoids we sketched generalized notions of background fields and aspects of their induced models let us list some related topics not touched on here some models and couplings can be defined using infinitesimal versions of gauge n groupoids e g a remarkable aksz construction 1 utilizes essentially lie algebroids as gauge lie algebras the relation betwen higher groupoids and l algebroids particularly integration is an active area of research cf its role in our context in 36 with actions of higher
