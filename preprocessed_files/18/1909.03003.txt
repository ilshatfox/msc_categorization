fusion rules for permutation extensions of modular tensor categories colleen delaney september 9 2019 abstract we give a construction and algorithmic description of the fusion ring of permutation extensions of an arbitrary modular tensor category using a combinatorial approach inspired by the physics of anyons and symmetry defects in bosonic topological phases of matter the definition is illustrated with examples namely bilayer symmetry defects and s 3 extensions of small modular tensor categories like the ising and fibonacci theories an implementation of the fusion algorithm is provided in the form of a mathematica package we introduce the notions of confinement and deconfinement of anyons and defects respectively which develop the tools to generalize our approach to more general fusion rings of g crossed extensions 1 introduction modular tensor categories and their module categories provide an algebraic framework to describe anyons boundaries and defects in 2 1 d bosonic topological phases of matter a special case is when a modu lar tensor category mtc with a g action admits a g crossed graded extension by a family of invertible bimodule categories when g acts not just as a group on the decategorified part of an mtc namely its fusion ring but acts on c by braided monoidal autoequivalences then the simple objects in the invertible bimodule categories cg describe point like twist defects at the end of invertible domain walls that can be manifest by adding terms to the hamiltonian of the anyon theory depending on whether the cg form a fusion category extending c the extension is interpreted as symmetry enriched topological set order or anomalous set order in the latter case there exists a g crossed braided fusion category which can be interpreted as the algebraic theory of anyons and symmetry defects in 2 1 d bosonic set order the obstruction theory determining the existence and subsequent classification of gxbfcs was given in by etingof nikshych and ostrik in 15 the obstructions to lifting a group action on a braided fusion category c to a categorical group action and the obstructions to the pentagon axioms needed for the cg to form a g crossed braided fusion category gxbfc are measured by cohomology classes in h 3 g a and h 4 g u 1 respectively the inequivalent gxbfcs then form a h 2 g a h 3 g u 1 torsor while 15 provides a classification of set order it is still worthwhile to give an explicit construction of gxbfcs in terms of mtcs and suitable categorical group actions by g both from the point of view of computational physics and abstract quantum algebra a simple but important example is the case of permutation symmetry of multilayer topological order corresponding to sn crossed braided extensions of deligne product mtcs of the form c n while its counterpart in conformal field theory permutation orbifolding is well understood and algebraic data for 1 ar x iv 1 90 9 03 00 3 v 1 m at h q a 6 s ep 2 01 9 permutation extensions has been described in the language of tqft for practitioners of condensed matter theory it is desirable to have a construction purely in terms of mtcs in this paper we develop an elementary approach to modeling the fusion rings of gxbfcs in order to understand the fusion rules satisfied by topological charges and symmetry defects in set phases of matter and apply it to construct the fusion rings for permutation extensions c n sn of mtcs we define an h 2 sn a n torsor of sn crossed ring extensions of the fusion ring of a deligne product category c n for arbitrary modular tensor categories c the main theorem is an explicit construction of the possible fusion rules for c n sn in terms of the fusion rules for c and a choice of 2 cocycle valued in a n the group of abelian anyon types in c n theorem fusion rings of permutation extensions of mtcs the fusion rings of sn crossed braided exten sions of c n are given by the permutation defect fusion rings c sn which can be computed from the data c n our construction gives a short algorithm to compute the fusion rules algorithm permutation defect fusion algorithm the fusion product of two permutation defects x a and x b can be computed as follows 1 and deconfinement strip the topological charges from the defects and twist with the abelian anyon 2 transposition defect annihilation compute the fusion product of the bare and defects for every pair of indices ij permuted by both and pulling out a factor of c irr c c i c j 3 confinement confine the product of the objects from step 1 and step 2 with the bare defect an implementation in the form of a mathematica package permutationdefectfusion m is provided at the author s website see appendix a for a code sample showing the main function we cast the statements and proofs of our results purely in terms of classical abstract algebra rings modules and group actions to demonstrate the principle that classical things can be understood through classical means on the other hand higher data requires higher data but the benefit of the topological phase inspired approach is not just that it is straightforward to construct the fusion rings it becomes trans parent how to categorify the fusion rings which we discuss in upcoming work 10 and provides alternate categorical proofs of the results herein 1 1 related work and acknowledgments the fusion rules for permutation defects were first understood in terms of modular functors in 5 the approach taken here was independent and uses the data c n consisting of a fusion ring c of an mtc c a choice of n and a choice of 2 cocycle 2 in contemporaneous work 6 bischoff and jones give a more general algorithm for fusion rules for spherical g crossed braided extensions of arbitrary fusion categories c using different methods they ap ply it to derive formulas for the fusion rules of maximal cyclic subextensions c n z nz of permutations c n sn giving an alternate description to the one that follows from our section 4 the author thanks christoph schweigert for bringing his and his collaborators work to their attention and to corey jones and marcel bischoff for coordinating the publication of related results thanks as well to eric samperton for helpful advice with an earlier version of this manuscript the perspective developed here was heavily influenced by the author s time at microsoft station q and thanks zhenghan wang mike freedman and parsa bonderson 1 2 overview of contents we begin in section 2 with a brief review of the algebraic theory of anyons and symmetry defects and establish the notions needed to work with them at the level of their fusion rings in section 3 we introduce the terminology and tools like g confinement and g deconfinement that are then applied in section 4 to construct the permutation defect fusion ring i e the fusion ring of the gxbfcs c n sn examples when n 2 and n 3 are given in section 5 to demonstrate the defect fusion algorithm and illustrate the main features of the general theory from section 3 we conclude our discussion in section 6 with a brief comment on generalizations of our approach for general gxbfcs and applications 2 preliminaries although our goal is to understand permutation extensions of mtcs as categories the approach used here to compute the sn crossed fusion ring doesn t require any higher data the fusion ring and its physical interpretation can be understood in terms of elementary abstract algebra requiring only knowledge of the symmetric group sn z based rings in the sense of 14 and second group cohomology for this reason we present our results in a decategorified way and refer the reader to other sources for detailed definitions of mtcs and gxbfcs and their interpretation as algebraic theories of anyons and symmetry defects in 2 1 d topological phases of matter see 1 9 that being said we will still use the notation and for multiplication and addition in the fusion ring especially in section 4 we abuse notation and write objects to mean their isomorphism class conflating anyons and defects with their types these choices have the effect of making the proofs of our results elementary if a bit inelegant however the techniques we use here to construct g crossed braided fusion rings readily suggest the form of their categorification which we construct in an upcoming sequel 10 and which provides a categorical proof of the following results 2 1 algebraic theory of anyons and topological charge fusion although strictly speaking the interpretation of mtcs as topological order is only for unitary mtcs and our results are stated for more general braided fusion categories we will freely use the physics terminology for umtcs throughout definition an anyon is a simple object in a unitary modular tensor category c an anyon type or topolog ical charge is the isomorphism class of an anyon 3 for our purposes it will be enough to know that the topological charges form a unital commutative based z ring i e a braided fusion ring we will consistently use calligraphic fonts for fusion categories c and standard font c to denote fusion rings passage from the calligraphic font to standard font c c indicates the appropriate decategorification for groups like g and aut c their categorical groups are indicated by g and aut c definition unital based z ring 14 let c be a ring which is free as a z module a z basis of a c is a set of elements b bi i i such that bibj k i n k ijbk where n k ij z a unital based z ring is a ring with a fixed z basis b such that 1 1 b 2 there exists an involution i 7 i of i such that the induced map a 7 a is an anti involution of c and whenever bibj nkijbk n 1 ij 1 i j 0 i 6 j given a basis of topological charges or defect types see definition 2 2 equipped with the involution that sends every object to its dual the data of the fusion ring is encoded by the fusion coefficients nabc the abelian topological charges those a l such that for all b l there exists a unique c l with nabc 6 0 form an abelian group under fusion denoted by a definition group action on fusion ring let g be a group and c a braided fusion ring with fixed basis a g action on c is a homomorphism g aut c where aut c is the group of involution preserving ring isomorphisms of c a g action on a fusion ring induces the symmetry nabc n g a g b g c of the fusion coefficients the obstruction that measures whether a family of g graded c bimodules coming from a group action on c under the isomorphism brpic c aut c form a fusion ring is given by a cohomology class inh 3 g a 15 2 2 algebraic theory of symmetry defects g crossed braided fusion rings when the h 3 g a obstruction vanishes the extension fusion ring has the structure of a g crossed braided g crossed commutative fusion ring definition g crossed braided fusion ring let c be a fusion ring of an mtc with a g action a g crossed braided fusion ring c g is a fusion ring which admits a g grading by c bimodules cg where cid c together with a g action on c g such that xg y g y xg 1 for all xg cg and y c g an additional h 4 g u 1 obstruction to the existence of gxbfcs measures the failure for the invert ible c bimodule categories cg to satisfy the pentagon axioms and form a fusion category 15 in other words it determines whether a g crossed braided ring extension of c lifts to a g crossed braided extension of c 4 definition 1 given a categorical group action of g on an mtc c a group symmetry defect is a simple object in an invertible c bimodule category cg under the equivalence brpic c autbr c a symmetry defect type is its isomorphism class when the h 3 obstruction vanishes but the h 4 doesn t the g graded extension of c by bimodule cat egories is interpreted as anomalous g symmetry enriched topological order in the sense that the fusion cannot be realized by point like objects in a strictly 2 1 d system but can potentially be realized as a 2 dimensional slice of some n 1 d system in this case the decategorified part of the anomalous g extension is still a fusion ring just a fusion ring which cannot be lifted to a g crossed braided fusion category while in the case of permutation extensions the h 4 g u 1 obstruction does vanish 16 the tools we develop should be applicable to the case of anomalous set order and thus we keep our discussion slightly more general 2 3 permutation extensions of mtcs let p be the monoidal functor that acts strictly on c n by permutations p sn autbr c n id 7 id c n c n 7 t c n c n ixi 7 ix i ifi 7 if i so that the tensorators u t x y t x t y and compositors x t t x t x are the identity isomorphisms for all sn and x y obj c n for these untwisted permutation actions on mtcs it is known that the h 4 g u 1 obstruction van ishes theorem 16 the h 4 sn u 1 obstruction to sn extensions of c n vanish for the categorical permu tation group action p sn autbr c n and the equivalence classes of sn extensions form a torsor over h 3 g u 1 the permutation symmetry models a global unitary on site symmetry of multi layer topological order given by n layers of topological order c 1 c c c sn y c n sn sn c while we been interpreting the factors in the deligne product as spatially separated layers the permu tation symmetry is technically on site because c n can also be interpreted a monolayer topological order this is what allows us to study the spatial symmetry using the techniques developed for on site symmetries in 1 5 prior to the development of gxbfcs as the algebraic theory of symmetry defects physicists studied per mutation defects in 2 1 d tpm under the guise of genons 2 so called because of the way they effectively couple layers of topological phases to create nontrivial topology 1 2 the ability of genons to entangle the layers comes from the sn crossed braiding whereby exchange with defects transports monolayer anyons between layers iai ia i x x 3 confinement deconfinement and fusion rules between anyons and g defects our model of symmetry defect fusion is based on a parametrization of defect types by fixed points irr cg x g f f irr c with g f f 2 one benefit is that when id one recovers the anyons in c cid as the fixed points under the action by the identity element ofg thus we can think of anyons as trivial symmetry defects although in what follows we reserve the term symmetry defect to indicate g 6 id it is also worth mentioning that the defects within each sector inherit an ordering from an ordering of c definition 2 defect charge let xgf cg be a symmetry defect then f is called the topological charge of the defect xgf since the isomorphism class of the monoidal unit 1 is always fixed by a g action each sector has a distinguished object 1 with vacuum charge following 1 we make the following definition definition 3 bare defect a symmetry defect with vacuum charge xg 1 is called a bare defect 3 1 confined versus deconfined objects in topological phases anyons being intrinsic quasiparticle excitations corresponding to the ground state of a hamiltonian which can be moved by local operators without additional energy are said to be deconfined on the other hand point like symmetry defects are not finite energy excitations they are extrinsic in the sense that a hamiltonian realization of a topological phase enriched with symmetry needs additional terms added in order for it to have excitations which correspond to the symmetry defects 1 moreover the energy needed to spatially separate defects grows differently than it does for anyons and they are said to be confined as opposed to deconfined we make the following definitions of g confinement and g deconfinement borrowing the ideas from condensed matter theory 1 1 these are at odds with the sense in which deconfinement is used in the context of anyon condensation which is why we have made the dependence on the group element explicit 6 3 2 g confinements and g deconfinement of anyons and g defects definition 4 g deconfinement let xgf be a g defect with charge f and let d f obj c be any object not necessarily simple with the property that d f xg 1 x g f 3 then we say that d f is a deconfinement or write dg f is a g deconfinement of the defect x g f in general a defect has multiple deconfinements definition 5 g confinement let a irr c xg 1 irr cg a bare defect and define c a mk 1 g k a 4 where g m then the defect xg c a is called the confinement of a observe that g c a c a so that confinement is well defined 4 fusion rules for permutation defects now we apply the ideas introduced in the previous section to construct g crossed braided fusion rings directly in the case of g sn acting on deligne product mtcs c n the definition of the permutation defect fusion ring c n sn proceeds by specifying a free z module on a basis of permutation defect types and a binary operation that gives it the structure of a g crossed commutative unital z based ring 4 1 model for multilayer anyons and permutation defects we will consistently use c n to mean the fusion ring of c n with respect to a basis irr c n iai ai irr c 1 i n since the rank of each sector in an sn extension is given by the number of fixed anyons under the action of see for example 4 one can index the isomorphism classes of simple objects in c by irr c x iai ai irr c n with i a i iai 5 occasionally we use a iai or supress the deligne product and write ai to simplify notation it will soon become apparent that this parametrization of symmetry defects is the key to constructing the fusion ring in a group theoretical way allowing one to construct the sn extension of c n from s 2 extensions of c c in exactly the same way that sn is generated by its transpositions definition 6 permutation defect type basis let c n sn be the free z module on the set irr c n irr c which we will also write as sn x a a a the following sections endow c sn with the structure of a g crossed braided fusion ring see definition 2 2 7 4 1 1 overview of construction in section 4 2 we define c n bimodules c with respect to the bases x a a a a irr c n and in section 4 3 define an sn action on the z module c sn which is free on the basis sn x a a a section 4 4 defines a multiplication on c sn and show that this gives it the structure of an sn graded sn crossed braided fusion ringc sn sn c extendingc n we call c sn the permutation defect fusion ring in section 4 5 we show that this fusion ring can be realized as a basepoint for an h 2 sn a torsor s worth of fusion rings c sn in the final section 4 5 we conclude that the fusion rules for permutation extensions of mtcs can be constructed from the data nab c n we give an algorithm to compute the fusion product of permutation defects and an implementation see appendix a 4 1 2 notation and terminology we use standard permutation notation for sn for an arbitrary permutation sn we write its disjoint cycle decomposition as 1 2 s where each i is a cycle i 1 i 2 im by abuse of notation we conflate permutations with the subsets of 1 2 n that they act nontrivially on and for example write i j to mean that the two permutations are disjoint and i i to indicate that a given i 1 2 n is or isn t permuted nontrivially by the action of throughout we will use the physics terminology whose corresponding mathematical meaning was given in the next table 2 1 d tpm umtc multi layer topological order deligne product of umtcs c n multi layer set order unitary snxbfc c n sn sn c multilayer anyon a iai where ai irr c vacuum iso

im permutation defect simple object x ifi c bare defect x 1 n table 1 mathematical definitions of the physics terminology we will use when discussing permutation enriched topological order 8 4 2 fusion of multilayer anyons and permutation defects the multiplication on c sn that we are about to define restricts to a commutative associative binary operation on cid c n and for this reason in any expression involving only products in c n we will freely commute elements and omit parenthesization without comment first we restate definitions 4 and 9 in the case of permutation symmetry of c n definition 7 confinement let a irr c n and write a disjoint cycle decomposition of as j j then the confinement map c c n c n is defined on basis elements by c a ici where ci ai i k j ak i j 6 and extended linearly to c n proposition 1 the confinement map has the following properties 1 c a b c a c b 2 c k a c a for all a b irr c n 1 k proof easy consequences of definition 7 these will be applied often in the proofs that follow definition 8 permutation sectors let c be the free z module on the basis of defect types irr c the confinement map is the main ingredient in extending the fusion between anyons to an action on defects definition 9 anyon defect fusion let a irr c and x b irr c then we define a binary operation c n c c on basis elements by a x b x c a b 7 and identically for c c n c definition 10 deconfinement let x b irr c a irr c n and suppose they satisfy a x 1 x b 8 then we say that a is a left deconfinement of xb and define right deconfinements in the analogous way using the right action 9 when we want to strip the topological charge from a defect by splitting off an anyon but without making a specific choice of deconfinement we write x a d a x 1 9 we will see that the notion of deconfinement is central to our construction as it allows us to intuit the way that the defect theory is built from the anyon theory lemma 1 anyon defect fusion is independent of choice of deconfinements in other words we can write a x b a d b x 1 10 for any choice of deconfinement d b proof we have a x b x c a b 11 x c a c d b 12 by the definitions of confinement deconfinement where d b is any deconfinement then by proposition 1 x c a c d b x c a d b 13 a d b x 1 14 example 1 fusion of monolayer anyons and bare defects the fusion between monolayer anyons 1 i 1 a 1 n i and bare defects x 1 is given by 1 i 1 a 1 n i x 1 x bj bj 1 j j a j 6 j 15 for example when n 2 1 a x 1 a 1 x 1 xaa 16 for all a irr c in words fusing an anyon in the ith layer with the bare defect results is the defect with the topological charge label that has a in every layer which is in the orbit of i proposition 2 c is a c n c n bimodule with respect to anyon defect fusion proof distributivity was built in to the definition of the confinement map and fusion and it is immediate that 1 x a x a 1 for all a a the only axioms of a bimodule that need to be checked are 10 left right and middle associativity these are any easy consequence of proposition 1 and commutativity of associativity of in c n for example a b x c xc a b c 17 x c a c b c 18 a x c b c 19 a b x c 20 the other cases are similar 4 3 sn action on defects so far we have a free z module c sn which is an sn graded extension of c by bimodules c sn sn c definition 11 let sn then define a map sn c sn c sn on basis elements by x a x 1 a 21 one can check this is a well defined action of sn on c sn extending the action of sn on c n due to associativity in sn proposition 3 sn crossed commutativity of topological charge and defect type fusion x a b b x a proof we have x a b b d a x 1 22 x c b d a 23 x c b c d a 24 x c b a 25 b x a 26 by lemma 1 definition 9 and parts 1 and 2 of proposition 1 later we will show that the multiplication on all of c sn is sn crossed commutative but lemma 3 will be helpful for showing said multiplication is associative 11 4 4 fusion of permutation defects finally we are ready to define a product on all of c sn definition 12 defect fusion let x a and x b be two symmetry defects then their untwisted product is given by x a x b d a d b ikil c irr c 1 ik 1 c 1 il ik 1 c 1 n il x 1 27 it will become clear that the choice of ordering of factors in the product and left justification is arbitrary but we will present our calculations this way consistently the fusion product that results from the annihilation of transposition defects is an object with nice properties that will come in handy later the next proposition says it can teleport anyons from layer to layer and is invariant under the layer exchange symmetry let ij be a transposition and write x ij 1 x ij 1 c irr c c i c j as shorthand for the fusion product of bare transposition defects proposition 4 properties of the transposition fusion product the following equations hold 1 c irr c a c i c j c irr c c i c a j for all a irr c 2 ij c irr c c i c j c irr c c i c j proof for 1 one can write c a c c b c nacb b c b c n b a c b c b c b n b a c c b b b a 28 where b and c range over all of irr c and we have used symmetries of the fusion coefficients that come from duality induced isomorphisms of trivalent hom spaces in c see for example 17 14 relabeling gives equation 1 equation 2 follows immediately from the fact that the sum is over all of irr c and relabeling 12 the following lemma shows that it suffices to check associativity for bare transposition defects lemma 2 associativity of bare transposition defects implies associativity of all nontrivial permutation defects proof suppose x 1 1 x 2 1 x 3 1 x 1 1 x 2 1 x 3 1 29 then x 1 a x 2 b x 3 c d 1 a d 2 b x 1 1 x 2 1 d 3 c x 3 1 d 1 a d 2 b d 3 c x 1 1 x 2 1 x 3 1 d 1 a d 2 b d 3 c x 1 1 x 2 1 x 3 1 x 1 a x 2 b x 3 c 30 since transpositions generate sn associativity for arbitrary permutation defects follows immediately thus it is enough to check associativity for bare transposition defects lemma 3 bare transposition defect associativity x 1 1 x 2 1 x 3 1 x 1 1 x 2 1 x 3 1 31 proof there are several cases to check we start with the border cases a if 1 2 3 are pairwise disjoint then both sides of equation 31 simplify to x 1 2 3 1 by part 1 of proposition 5 b if 1 2 3 then both sides of equation 31 yield x c a irr c a a by definition 12 c if 1 2 3 1 definition 12 gives x 1 2 3 1 the remaining cases are similar and the details not particularly illuminating lemma 4 sn defect type fusion is associative making c sn into a ring proof of course products involving three anyons are associative and associativity of triple defect products follows from combining lemmas 2 and 3 by propositions 2 and 3 products involving two anyons and one defect are associative it remains only to check associativity for products involving one anyon and two defects we show a x b x c a x b x c 32 and claim that the other cases are similar note that it suffices to check the case where 1 and 2 are transpositions since together with equation 32 lemma 3 generates equality between such parenthesizations with arbitrary permutations we index the confinements and deconfinements using the transposition indices 1 2 to simplify notation on the one hand we have a x 1 b x 2 c x 1 c 1 a b x 2 c d 1 c 1 a b d 2 c x 1 1 x 2 1 d 1 c 1 a b d 2 c x 1 2 1 1 6 2 c irr c c i c j 1 2 ij 33 13 on the other hand a x 1 b x 2 c a d 1 b d 2 c x 11 x 2 1 a d 1 b d 2 c x 1 2 1 1 6 2 c irr c c i c j 1 2 ij 34 now it is not necessarily the case that d 1 c 1 a b d 2 c a d 1 b d 2 c however in the case 1 6 2 it suffices to show that their confinements with respect to 1 2 are equal if 1 2 the confinement of d 1 c 1 a b d 2 c is the object ixi xi ai bi ci i 1 2 ai 1 aj 1 bi ci 1 cj 1 i 1 aj 1 aj 2 bi 2 bj 2 ci i 2 which one can check this is the same as the confinement of a d 1 b d 2 c the case where 1 and 2 multiply to a 3 cycle is similar now let 1 2 and write ij write d b i j di j 35 d c i j ei j 36 d c a b i j fi j 37 where the equations di dj bi bj 38 ei ej ci cj 39 fi fj ai aj bi ai aj bj 40 are satisfied by definition 4 comparising the products layer wise indexing by k one has d c a b d c c irr c c i c j and a d b d c c irr c c i c j clearly when k 6 i j the kth entry of both products are equal and hence it suffices to consider the ith and jth entries which become c irr c fi ei c i fj ej c j and 14 c irr c ai di ei c i aj dj ej c j by proposition 4 and commutativity of multiplication in cid checking whether these two objects are equal can be reduced to checking whether fi fj ei ej ai aj di dj ei ej both sides simplify to ai aj bi ci by equations 38 40 together with the confinement map that determines anyon defect fusion the following proposition shows that bare transposition defects generate permutation defects in the same way that transpositions generate all of sn proposition 5 1 products of disjoint bare defects commute and are themselves bare defects x 1 x 1 x 1 when 41 2 every bare defect x 1 can be written as a product of bare transposition defects proof the first is an immediate consequence of definition 12 the second follows from definition 12 and proposition 3 that one can write x 1 i x i 1 i j x ij 1 42 where i i 1 i 2 imi is any transposition decomposition of the ith disjoint cycle in the decomposition of 4 4 1 sn crossed braiding lemma 5 the multiplication is sn crossed x a x b x b x a proof first observe that if d b is a deconfinement of x b then d b is a 1 deconfinement of x 1 b since the fusion products are independent of choice of deconfinements we have x b x a x 1 b x a d 1 b x 1 x a d b x 1 1 x a d b x a x 1 x a d b x 1 x a x b 43 15 theorem 1 the permutation defect fusion ring c sn is a unital based z ring which is sn crossed commutative proof let a be the free z module generated by the set irr c n irr c combining the multipli cation coming from the fusion ring of c n the confinement map in definition 5 2 and the definition of bare defect fusion products in definitions 5 4 and 5 5 defines an associative binary operation a a a that gives a the structure of a ring as a consequence of our definitions the products are all given by non negative integer linear combina tions of basis elements irr c n irr c and the unit 1 irr c n is simple therefore we have a unital z ring now since a a for all simple objects in an mtc by pivotality and g 1 1 g for all g g the following map defines an involution on basis elements a 7 a a irr c n 44 x a 7 x 1 a x a irr c 45 which we expand linearly to an involution on all of a since that nab 1 1 if and only if a b it remains only to check that this involution corresponds to duality of defects fix sn a irr c n and let x a c x b c clearly n x ax b 1 0 unless 1 given a transposition decomposition of m t 1 with j j 1 j 2 j 1 j 2 we have x a x 1 b d a d b x 1 x 1 1 d a d b 1 j m c irr c 1 j 1 1 c 1 j 2 j 1 c 1 n j 2 46 in the fusion product over j there is one summand of 1 hence n x ax 1 b 1 1 only if n d a d b 1 1 so we must have d b d a in other words the deconfinements must be dual now reconfinement with an arbitrary bare defect gives x 1 d a d b x 1 x a b 47 and hence b a finally lemma 5 gives sn crossed commutativity 4 5 twisted fusion of permutation defects the fusion ring we have defined forms a basepoint for an h 2 sn a n torsor definition 13 twisted defect fusion let sn sn a n be a 2 cocycle for the permutation action of sn on a n define x a x b x a x b 48 lemma 6 the twisted fusion product gives an sn crossed fusion ring structure on the defects for every 2 cocycle sn sn a n 16 proof the twisted fusion product is associative on the one hand x a x b x c x a x b x c 49 x a x b x c 50 x a x b x c 51 on the other hand x a x b x c x a x b x c 52 x a x b x c 53 x a x b x c 54 where we have used the sn crossed braiding and associativity of anyon defect fusion since is a 2 cocycle for the sn action on a n it satisfies 55 whenever two 2 cocycles and differ by a 2 coboundary their corresponding twisted fusion products and give rise to isomorphic sn crossed fusion rings lemma 7 c sn and c sn are isomorphic as sn crossed fusion rings if and only if and differ by a 2 coboundary proof there exists a map sn a such that where satisfies 56 we check that defines a ring isomorphism between the rings c sn and c sn if and only if and differ by a 2 coboundary x a x a 57 on the one hand x a x b x a x b 58 on the other hand x a x b x a x b x a x b x a x b x a x b 59 17 4 6 the permutation defect fusion ring and algorithm we have constructed a torsor of sn crossed fusion rings over h 2 sn a n which classify such fusion rings extending those c n since the h 4 sn u 1 obstruction vanishes by the work of 16 every such sn crossed extension ring lifts to an sn crossed braided extension 15 therefore we can conclude that the twisted sn defect fusion construction realizes the fusion rules for permutation extensions of mtcs c n theorem 2 given an mtc c and a 2 cocycle representing h 2 sn a n the equivalence classes of fusion rings of sn crossed braided extensions of c n are given by the isomorphism classes of the fusion rings c sn in particular the following algorithm 1 produces the correct fusion rules algorithm 1 permutation defect fusion algorithm the fusion product of two permutation defects x a and x b can be computed as follows 1 and deconfinement strip the topological charges from the defects and twist with the abelian anyon 2 transposition defect annihilation compute the fusion product of the bare and defects for every pair of indices ij permuted by both and pulling out a factor of c irr c c i c j 3 confinement confine the product of the objects from step 1 and step 2 with the bare defect an implementation of the algorithm is given in a mathematica permutationdefectfusion m package in appendix a we show the main function implementing algorithm 1 the full code is available at the author s website math ucsb edu cdelaney research 5 examples the salient features of the sn crossed fusion ring construction can be illustrated through a few small ex amples first we recall the bilayer symmetry defect fusion rules established in 1 13 5 from which the general permutation defect fusion rules are built the fusion rules for the trilayer fibonacci defects of the rank 24 fusion category fib 3 s 3 in section 5 2 1 exhibit the overall pattern of sn crossed fusion rings in particular how they are determined by the fusion ring of c and bare s 2 defects in section 5 2 2 we repeat the example for the rank 3 ising mtcs with fusion rules 1 1 18 math

topological order with z 2 z symmetry c c s 2 y c 2 s 2 c 2 c 12 fusion rules for s 2 extensions of c c were first proven 5 in the language of modular functors more recently they appeared in the physics literature in 1 and in the case of fib 2 z 2 z were computed directly by computer assisted de equivariantization of the mtc su 2 8 7 fusion rules for c c s 2 directly in terms of c were then proven in 13 recasting these results yet again in our model the form of the general fusion rules for c c s 2 cid c 12 can be understood as follows writing irr c 12 x 12 a a a irr c for the fusion rules corresponding to the trivial cocycle 1 we find that every defect is fixed by the s 2 action and related to the bare defect by fusion with a monolayer anyon a 1 also 1 a in particular the fusion

2 fusion table for bilayer fibonacci anyons and defects 5 2 trilayer topological order with s 3 symmetry the general pattern of fusion in sn extensions can be seen from the n 3 case ranks of permutation extensions are large even for small n with rank fib 3 s 3 24 and rank ising 3 s 3 60 so rather than providing the full fusion table for these examples we give a more compact description in the form of the fusion table for bare permutation defects and show how to use them to compute arbitrary products for general n the fusion rules can be derived from the n n 1 2 n n 1 2 table of its bare transposition defects but even then all transpositions behave identically and can be just as well understood through the n 2 case and the fusion algorithm 5 2 1 example trilayer fibonacci with s

so a 1 and h 3 s 3 a is trivial by the existence result of 16 and the classification of g crossed braided extensions of bfcs 15 there is a unique fusion ring shared among s 3 crossed extensions of fib

idea of the algorithm in section 4 can be applied to compute other fusion rings we conjecture that fusion rules between inverse defects in gxbfcs conform to the rule x g 1 x g 1 1 c c g c where c sums over a minimal subset of irr c which includes the identity is closed under duality and whose orbit under the tensor product and g action generates all of irr c the rough idea of how to generalize our algorithm given g a finite group with presentation g g 1 g 2 gk r 1 r 2 rl on generators is as follows by writing arbitrary g h g as words in gener ators g g 1 g 2 g h h 1 h 2 h fusion of arbitrary defects proceeds by computing the product of gg 1 g h and rewriting the group labels on the resulting bare defects using the group relations of course the last step involves some art to guarantee the algorithm terminates and thus isn t efficient in general but for small groups it suffices to quickly determine the fusion ring of the g extension 22 in particular all small examples of z 2 z extensions of mtcs we checked could be described in this manner we include two brief examples of untwisted fusion rules the z 2 z toric code with electromagnetic duality symmetry and vecz 3 z anyons with charge conjugation symmetry see 1 or 12 for more details example 2 toric code with e m symmetry e x 1 xf m x 1 xf f x 1 x 1 e xf x 1 m xf x 1 f xf xf x 1 x 1 1 f x 1 xf e m xf xf 1 f example 3 z 3 anyons with charge conjugation symmetry x 1 x 1 x 1 x 1 x 1 x 1 1 we conclude with a few short comments on some related directions 6 1 more general symmetries while our main result shows that it is still possible to learn new things about mtcs through elementary con siderations already there has been work towards a more general extension theory of mtcs by mathematical objects with richer structure than groups for example the hopf monads of 8 or hypergroups of 3 the success of a classical approach here suggests it may too be possible to deduce fusion rules for more general symmetry enriched categories using only the decategorified part of the symmetry 6 2 topological phases of matter and quantum computing with anyons and defects determining the possible quantum logical operations that can result from exchanging and measuring anyons and defects in an set phase requires algebraic data beyond the fusion rules however the fusion rules dictate which units of quantum information e g qubits qutrits qudits etc can be encoded in the multi fusion channels of objects for example it follows from theorem 1 that a collection of 4 bare ij defects with total vacuum charge in c n sn are always qudits with d rank c in upcoming work with eric samperton we leverage the approach to constructing fusion rings given here to construct their categorifications and then apply it to derive algebraic data for set phases from which we can derive insights into the interplay of symmetry topological order and quantum information see also 9 23 a permutation defect fusion code sample
