of two groups is generalized to describing sub groups of a direct product a 1 a 2 an of a finite number of groups other possible generalizations are discussed and applications characterizing several types of subgroups are given most of these applications are straightforward while somewhat deeper applications occur in the case of profinite groups cyclic groups and the sylow p subgroups including infinite groups that are virtual p groups 1 introduction in sections 11 12 of a paper written in 1889 gou 89 the famed french math ematician e douard goursat developed what is now called goursat s lemma also called goursat s theorem or goursat s other theorem for characteriz ing the subgroups of the direct product a b of two groups a b it seems to have been first attributed to goursat by j lambek in lam 58 lam 76 who in turn attributes h s m coxeter for bringing this to his attention the lemma is elementary and a fundamental question to consider for example it appears as exercise 5 p 75 in lang s algebra lan 02 it has also been the subject of recent expository articles pet 09 pet 11 in an undergraduate mathematics journal it is possible that other authors discovered the lemma independently without knowing the original reference indeed one such ex ample related to the theory of lie groups occurs in 1961 in a paper of a hattori hat 61 section 2 3 now translated into english

research council of canada 1 http arxiv org abs 1109 0024 v 3 other sources that mention goursat s lemma include papers of s dick son dic 69 in 1969 k ribet rib 76 in 1976 a book by r schmidt sch 94 chapter 1 6 a paper of d anderson and v camillo in 2009 ac 09 a preprint of a greicius in 2009 gre 09 a recent preprint by l to th to th 14 and several internet sites such as fl 10 aem 09 taken together these various sources demonstrate the applicability of goursat s lemma to diverse branches of mathematics there are a number of interesting possibilities for generalizing this useful lemma the first is to subgroups of a semi direct product and this is stud ied in use 91 the second is to other categories besides groups indeed it is proved for modules in lam 76 and this implies that it will hold in any abelian category by applying the embedding theorems of lubkin freyd heron mitchell cf mac 71 p 205 it is proved for rings in ac 09 the most general category in which one can hope to have a goursat lemma is an exact mal cev category cf fl 10 and for a proof of this fact cf clp 93 theorem 5 7 in this note we examine another generalization to the direct product of a finite number of groups while this seems at first glance to be a triviality since we can write a b c a b c unexpected complications arise as noted by arroyo et al in aem 09 the complications are overcome by considering an asymmetric version of the lemma cf sch 94 in section 2 which enables us to solve the general case in section 3 applications within group theory are given in section 4 these are divided into relatively easy applications followed by a more subtle application to profinite groups then to the cyclic subgroups of a direct product a 1 an and finally to the sylow p subgroups of a subgroup g of a direct product the conditions for sylow p subgroups are obtained not only for finite groups but also for virtual p groups groups having a subgroup that is a p group and has finite index an appendix gives an example that illustrates the necessity for the asymmetric version of goursat s lemma in order to generalize it to finite direct products acknowledgements we thank la slo to th for providing us with an al ternate proof of lemma 4 3 which uses the chinese remainder theorem as well as for pointing out a gap in the original proof of theorem 4 4 we also thank joseph rotman and hanafi farahat for further discussions that have been helpful with the group theoretic applications in section 4 2 2 goursat s lemma two versions for convenience and to establish the notation we start by stating the usual symmetric version of goursat s lemma let a b be groups and g a b be a subgroup the neutral element of each group a and b with slight abuse of notation will be written e let 1 a b a 2 a b b be the natural projections and 1 a a b 2 b a b be the usual inclusions 2 1 theorem goursat s lemma there is a bijective correspondence be tween subgroups g of a b and quintuples g 1 g 1 g 2 g 2 where g 1 g 1 a g 2 g 2 b and g 1 g 1 g 2 g 2 is an isomorphism as mentioned above the proof is elementary and given as an exercise in lan 02 it can also be found in ac 09 hat 61 the basic idea of the proof is as follows suppose that g is a subgroup of a b write g 1 1 g a a a b g for some b b g 1 1 1 g a a a e g similarly for g 2 and g 2 it is easily seen that g 1 g 1 g 2 g 2 the isomorphism g 1 g 1 g 2 g 2 is given by a b where a b g and a g 1 a b g 2 b are the respective cosets of a and b in g 1 g 1 g 2 g 2 again with slight abuse of notation it is easily checked that is independent of the choices of a b thus g determines the quintuple q 2 g g 1 g 1 g 2 g 2 conversely given a quintuple q g 1 g 1 g 2 g 2 where g 1 g 1 a g 2 g 2 b and g 1 g 1 g 2 g 2 let 2 q be the subgroup p 1 g where g g 1 g 1 g 2 g 2 is the graph of and p g 1 g 2 g 1 g 1 g 2 g 2 is the natural surjection the functions q 2 and 2 are inverse to each other 2 2 definition motivated by the correspondence between subgroups g of a b and the quintuples q we say that the quintuple q 2 g of theorem 2 1 is the goursat quintuple for g we now state an equivalent asymmetric version of the lemma cf sch 94 theorem 1 6 1 which is in effect a minor variation of theorem 2 1 but has the advantage that it generalizes easily to higher direct products as we shall see in section 3 an example in the appendix shows why this asymmetric version is necessary to deal with the higher direct products 2 3 theorem asymmetric version of goursat s lemma there is a bijective correspondence between subgroups g of a b and quadruples 3 g 1 g 2 g 2 1 where g 1 a g 2 g 2 b are arbitrary subgroups of a and b and 1 g 1 g 2 g 2 is a surjective homomorphism proof the proof is similar to that of theorem 2 1 for any subgroup g of a b we define q 2 g to be the quadruple q 2 g g 1 g 2 g 2 1 where g 1 g 2 and g 2 are the first third and fourth coordinates of q 2 g cf theorem 2 1 the surjection 1 is given by 1 a b for a g 1 and a b g for some b g 2 again easily seen to be independent of the choice of b conversely for an arbitrary quadruple q g 1 g 2 g 2 1 with g 1 a g 2 g 2 b and 1 g 1 g 2 g 2 a surjective homomorphism define 2 q p 1 g 1 where g 1 g 1 g 2 g 2 is the graph of 1 and p g 1 g 2 g 1 g 2 g 2 is the natural surjection the functions q 2 and 2 are inverse to each other the equivalence of theorem 2 1 and theorem 2 3 is easily seen it need only be pointed out that determines the surjection 1 as the composition g 1 g 1 g 1 g 2 g 2 while 1 determines via the first isomorphism theorem specifically g 1 g 2 g 2 g 1 ker 1 1 finally we have ker 1 a g 1 1 a b with b g 2 a g 1 a b g e b g a g 1 a e g g 1 4 2 4 remark it is often useful to note a few additional facts which we now list for a b cf hat 61 hz 09 a g 1 g 2 g g 1 g 2 b g g 1 g 2 g 1 g 1 g 2 g 2 c from b using g 1 g 2 g 1 g 2 one readily obtains that g g 1 g 2 g 2 g 1 for the cardinality of g d one has short exact sequences of groups 2 g 2 ker 1 g g g 1 1 g 1 ker 2 g g g 2 1 g 2 g 3 the generalized goursat lemma as mentioned in the introduction generalizing the usual goursat lemma from n 2 to n 2 seems to create unexpected complications however using the asymmetric version theorem 2 2 the generalization to finite n 2 becomes routine we will state the result theorem 3 2 below for n 2 after first introducing some convenient notation for any subgroup g of a 1 an 3 1 definition let s 1 2 n n and j nr s then g j s xj aj x 1 xj xn g for some xi ai 1 i n i 6 j with xi e if i s for example g 1 1 g g 1 2 3 n 1 x 1 a 1 x 1 e e g these correspond to the notation used in section 2 when n 2 via g 1 g 1 g 1 2 g 1 g 2 g 2 g 2 1 g 2 for brevity we extend this notation and let gk g k for all k for convenience we shall usually omit the brackets e g g 1 2 3 g 1 2 3 note that if t s then g j s g j t as in section 2 we let gi i g where i a 1 an ai is the standard projection onto the i th factor finally it will be convenient to also use i a 1 an a 1 ai for the standard projection onto the first i factors 1 i n e g 1 1 and n ida 1 an 5 3 2 theorem goursat s lemma for n 2 there is a bijective corre spondence between the subgroups g a 1 an and 3 n 2 tuples qn g g 1 g 2 g 2 1 1 gn g n 1 n 1 n 1 where gi ai g i 1 i 1 gi and i i gi 1 g i 1 1 i is a surjective homomorphism here i a 1 ai is defined recursively 1 i n 1 by setting 1 g 1 and i 1 2 i gi 1 g i 1 1 i i a 1 ai ai 1 with 2 as defined in theorem 2 2 proof starting with g we must construct the 3 n 2 tuple qn g all entries of which are already defined from g except the i we shall show by induction 1 i n 1 first that i i g and second that i can then be suitably defined to successfully carry out the inductive step to start the induction we simply observe that by hypothesis 1 g 1 and g 1 1 g 1 g now suppose as inductive hypothesis that i i g to define i i gi 1 g i 1 1 i suppose x i by the inductive hypothesis x a 1 ai i g a 1 ai then a 1 ai ai 1 an g for some aj aj j i 1 n we define i x ai 1 gi 1 g i 1 1 i to see that this definition makes sense one must check that ai 1 gi 1 that i is surjective and that the definition is independent of the choice of ai 1 the first two are obvious and as far as the third suppose a 1 ai a i a n g then e e a 1 i 1 a i 1 a 1 n a n g which implies a 1 i 1 a i 1 g i 1 1 i and therefore ai 1 a i 1 i e i is well defined from the definitions of i 1 of 2 theorem 2 2 and of i it is now obvious that i 1 i 1 g this completes the inductive step conversely suppose we are given a 3 n 2 tuple q g 1 g 2 g 2 1 1 g 3 g 3 1 2 2 gn g n 1 n 1 n 1 satisfying the hypotheses of the theorem then simply define a subgroup n q a 1 an by n q n because q 2 and 2 are inverse to one another cf proof of theorem 2 2 the iterated versions of these two operations namely qn and n are also inverse to one another 3 3 definition for a subgroup g a 1 an we say that the corre sponding 3 n 2 tuple qn g of theorem 3 2 is the goursat decomposition of g 6 we may also refer to the goursat quintuple of definition 2 2 as a goursat decomposition even though it differs slightly from the quadruple q 2 g in this paper the context makes clear the difference between these two possible decompositions 3 4 remark as in remark 2 3 g g 1 gn however the rest of remark 2 3 does not directly apply here 4 applications there are many potentially interesting applications of the generalized goursat lemma within group theory in this section we start with sev eral easy applications and then explore three relatively deeper applications profinite groups cyclic groups and p sylow subgroups for example an immediate consequence of the lemma is that the subgroup g is a sub direct product if and only if j is the trivial homomorphism 1 j n 1 4 1 proposition let c be a class of groups closed under taking subgroups quotient groups and finite direct products let g be a subgroup of a 1 an then g is in the class c iff each gi is in c proof the proposition follows from theorem 3 2 and remark 3 4 which taken together indicate that g is a subgroup of g 1 gn and furthermore each gi is a quotient of g for example proposition 4 1 holds for any serre class of abelian groups and any variety of groups in the sense of neu 67 in particular it holds for each of the following familiar families of groups a finite groups b abelian groups c p groups d nilpotent groups e groups nilpotent of class at most m e solvable groups to verify each of these examples one need only verify that each class of groups satisfies the hypotheses of proposition 4 1 this is trivial for a b c in e we find that groups which are nilpotent of class at most m are closed under subgroups and quotients as rot 95 theorem 5 35 5 36 as well the products of groups which are nilpotent of class at most m must be nilpotent of class at most m since the commutator subgroup of the product is the product of the commutator subgroups similarly for d for f cf rot 95 theorems 6 11 6 12 and corollary 6 14 7 it is interesting to note that hattori in hat 61 or hz 09 first deter mined the finite subgroups of the lie group s 3 which is isomorphic to su 2 sp 1 spin 3 as a lie group he then applied goursat s lemma and proposition 4 1 to determine all finite subgroups of s 3 s 3 using the results of section 3 we could now for example find all finite subgroups of s 3 n s 3 it is also interesting that in fact the papers of goursat gou 89 and hattori hat 61 or hz 09 study closely related questions as another interesting application which also involves some topology we consider profinite groups their definition and basic properties can be found in ram val 99 briefly a topological group is a profinite group if it can be obtained as an inverse limit of finite groups each having the discrete topology profinite groups can also be characterized as topological groups that are hausdorff compact and totally disconnected the class of profinite groups is closed with respect to taking closed subgroups quotient groups by a closed normal subgroup and arbitrary direct products however arbitrary subgroups of profinite groups may not be profinite so proposition 4 1 does not immediately apply we shall nevertheless be able obtain a similar result by being careful about the topology for simplicity we start with two profinite groups a b and a subgroup g a b where a b has the product topology and g the subspace topol ogy of course g has a goursat decomposition q 2 g g 1 g 2 g 2 1 as a group we topologize gi i 1 2 using the surjection i g gi and giving gi the identification topology also called the quotient topol ogy then g 1 g 1 is given the subspace topology we also note that the usual projection and inclusion maps i i are continuous since the product topology is being used and that each space gi gi is a subspace of either a or b hence is hausdorff note that the notation gi is being used here as in theorem 2 1 definition and subsequently it has nothing to do with the closure operator in topology 4 2 proposition let a b be profinite groups and g a b as above then g is a profinite group iff each of the subgroups in the goursat decom position for g are profinite groups and 1 is continuous proof suppose that g is a profinite group using the hausdorff property we have e b g is a closed subgroup of g so also profinite but then 2 e b g g 2 is a continuous bijection of a compact space onto a hausdorff space hence a homeomorphism since it is also a group isomorphism g 2 is profinite and similarly for g 1 since i gi are closed normal subgroups of g remark 2 4 d and the properties of profinite groups 8 imply that gi are also profinite now consider the continuous surjective homomorphism id p g 1 g 2 g 1 g 2 g 2 recalling that g id p 1 g 1 we have g 1 id p g this is a continuous image of a compact space hence compact and hence closed since it lies in the hausdorff space g 1 g 2 g 2 by the closed graph theorem 1 is continuous conversely suppose that g 1 g 2 g 2 are profinite groups and 1 is continuous then g 2 g 2 is also a profinite group since 1 is continuous we must have again by the closed graph theorem that the graph g 1 g 1 g 2 g 2 is a closed subgroup the identification map q g 1 g 2 g 1 g 2 g 2 is continuous therefore g q 1 g 1 is a closed subgroup of the profinite group g 1 g 2 hence g being a closed subgroup of a profinite group is itself profinite we remark that there is a close relation between proposition 4 2 above and gre 09 lemma 4 6 although neither one implies the other it is also clear that proposition 4 2 will generalize to subgroups of finite direct prod ucts of profinite groups with more than two factors in the obvious way the next application that of determining the cyclic subgroups of a b will involve more substantial use of goursat s lemma cyclic subgroups are not closed under products so proposition 4 1 does not apply we shall henceforth use additive notation since g 1 g 1 g 2 g 2 will be abelian one preliminary lemma will be needed 4 3 lemma let d divide both m and n and let zm dzm zn dzn be a given isomorphism where both groups are of course isomorphic to zd then there exist generators of respectively zm and zn such that where dzm and similarly dzn proof we take 1 and set 1 0 so 0 generates zn dzn zd this means that d and 0 are coprime in general 0 and n need not be coprime however 0 0 d 0 2 d so it will suffice to show that 0 kd is coprime to n for some k by dirichlet s famous theorem dir 1837 there are infinitely many primes in the arithmetic progression 0 kd so we can choose k with p 0 kd prime and also p not a divisor of n then p and n are coprime and taking p zn fulfills the conclusion of the lemma lemma 4 3 is necessary because given cyclic groups g 1 and g 2 sub groups h 1 g 1 and h 2 g 2 and an isomorphism g 1 h 1 g 2 h 2 a 9 representative g 2 of being a generator of g 1 need not generate g 2 for example there is an isomorphism z 45 9 z 45 z 198 9 z 198 defined by 1 2 but 2 z 198 is not a generator however 2 11 20 29 and although 11 and 20 are also not generators of z 198 29 is coprime to 198 and so is a generator 4 4 theorem let g be a subgroup of a b with goursat quintuple q 2 g g 1 g 1 g 2 g 2 a the subgroup g is finite cyclic if and only if g 1 g 2 are both finite cyclic and g 1 g 2 have coprime order furthermore g lcm g 1 g 2 b the subgroup g is infinite cyclic if and only if either g 1 is infinite cyclic g 2 is finite cyclic and g 2 0 or g 2 is infinite cyclic g 1 is finite cyclic and g 1 0 or both g 1 g 2 are infinite cyclic with g 1 g 2 0 proof in either case a or b g 1 or g 2 being the homomorphic image of a cyclic group must be cyclic hence their respective subgroups g 1 g 2 are also cyclic a suppose g is finite cyclic then it is generated by an element whence g 1 is cyclic and generated by g 2 cyclic and generated by let the respective orders of g 1 g 2 i e of be m n and set d gcd m n also write m m 1 d n n 1 d then m 1 n 1 are coprime and there exist x y z with xm 1 yn 1 1 or equivalently xm yn d now n n 0 g implies n g 1 also m 0 g 1 hence d xm yn x m y n g 1 it follows that c g 1 if 0 c d for if c g 1 then c 0 g hence c 0 z for some integer z therefore z 0 c z whence n z and m c z since d divides m and n we have d divides both z c z as a result d c which is a contradiction thus we conclude that g 1 is the cyclic subgroup of g 1 generated by d and having order m d m 1 similarly g 2 is generated by d and has order n 1 so the orders of g 1 and g 2 are coprime conversely suppose g 1 m 1 is coprime to g 2 n 1 and set d g 1 g 1 g 2 g 2 m m 1 d n n 1 d then d gcd m n also g 1 will be cyclic of order m g 2 cyclic of order n using the isomorphism g 1 g 1 g 2 g 2 and lemma 4 3 choose generators of g 1 and of g 2 with then and are elements of of order d whence has order d g 2 dn 1 n and generates g 2 also by goursat s lemma 10 g finally the order of is lcm o o lcm m n mn d dm 1 n 1 further again using goursat s lemma g g g 1 g 2 dm 1 n 1 thus g is cyclic of this order and generated by b since g is infinite and g g 1 g 2 at least one of g 1 g 2 must be infinite cyclic without loss of generality suppose g 1 z now suppose generates the cyclic group g then generates g 1 and generates g 2 we claim that g 2 0 for if y g 2 then y r for some integer r whence 0 y r 0 g this implies 0 y k k k for some integer k therefore k 0 whence k 0 and y k 0 hence g 2 0 we now consider separately the cases g 2 infinite and g 2 finite the case g 1 finite and g 2 z is symmetric to the latter so can be omitted suppose first g z with g 2 z then the argument in the previous paragraph now also implies g 1 0 conversely suppose g 1 g 2 z and g 1 g 2 0 then the isomorphisms cf remark 2 3 g g 1 g 2 g 1 g 1 g 2 g 2 reduce to g g 1 g 2 z secondly for the remaining case suppose g z g 1 z as before and now g 2 zn is cyclic of order n n 2 then n n 0 implies n g 1 and clearly i g 1 if i n thus g 1 nz and as before g 2 0 conversely suppose g 1 z g 1 nz g 2 zn and g 2 0 in this case we have the isomorphism g 1 g 1 g 2 g 2 zn let g 1 with generating g 1 g 1 then generates g 2 g 2 g 2 zn we claim that g is generated by the single element and thus is infinite cyclic to see this let x y g g 1 g 2 so x j y k for some integers j k furthermore x y g implies x y y which gives k y j j j then j k mod n so j j j j k x y 4 5 theorem let g be a subgroup of a b c with its goursat decom position g 1 g 2 g 2 1 1 g 3 g 3 1 2 2 a the subgroup g is finite cyclic if and only if g 1 g 2 g 3 are finite cyclic and each of the pairs of integers g 1 2 g 2 1 g 1 3 g 3 1 g 2 3 g 3 2 is coprime in this case one also has g lcm g 1 g 2 g 3 11 b the subgroup g is infinite cyclic if and only if one of the following three cases up to obvious permutation of indices occur i g 1 z g 2 and g 3 are finite cyclic g 2 1 g 3 1 0 and g 2 3 g 3 2 are coprime ii g 1 g 2 z g 3 finite cyclic and g 2 1 g 3 1 g 1 2 g 3 2 0 iii gi z for i 1 2 3 and g i j 0 for 1 i 6 j 3 proof a if g is finite cyclic then so is g 12 2 g a b applying part a of theorem 4 4 to g 12 gives us g 1 g 2 finite cyclic with g 1 2 coprime to g 2 1 the other conditions follow by symmetry conversely suppose g 1 g 2 g 3 are all finite cyclic with respective orders m n p and that the three coprimality conditions hold let g 12 1 12 g a b g 1 g 2 a b e g applying theorem 4 4 a two times we obtain that g 12 and g 12 are both finite cyclic with respective orders lcm m n lcm g 1 3 g 2 3 we next apply theorem 3 2 which tells us thatg is determined by the surjection 2 g 12 g 3 g 3 1 2 a third application of theorem 4 4 a now tells us that g will be cyclic if g 12 and g 3 1 2 are coprime but g 12 lcm g 1 3 g 2 3 and g 3 1 2 is a divisor of g 3 1 which is coprime to g 1 3 thus g 3 1 2 is coprime to g 1 3 and similarly is coprime to g 2 3 so also coprime to their least common multiple g 12 b the three cases when g is infinite cyclic all follow from theorem 4 4 b in obvious ways namely in b i we use a b c a b c in b ii and b iii we use a b c a b c we omit the details the generalization of this theorem to n 3 is now clear albeit cumber some to state since there will be many cases involved determining the sylow p subgroups of a a group g a 1 an in terms of the goursat decomposition of g is an application of a slightly different type our main result in this direction theorem 4 8 below gives a very simple and natural answer to this question and not only for finite groups but for certain classes of infinite groups we therefore commence with a brief discussion of sylow p subgroups for groups that are not necessarily finite taking p to be a fixed prime for the remainder of this section the sylow p subgroups of an arbitrary group g are easily defined as its maximal p subgroups which always exist by a zorn s lemma argument 12 however following rob 82 section 14 3 one sees that without some sort of finiteness hypothesis the familiar sylow theorems for a finite group can fail badly indeed it is possible for two sylow p subgroups to even have different cardinalities let alone be isomorphic or conjugate one hypothesis that will insure the usual sylow theorems hold namely that all sylow p subgroups are conjugate and their number is both finite and congruent to 1 modulo p is that there exists a sylow p subgroup with a finite number of conjugates this theorem was proved in 1938 by dieman kurosh uztov dku 38 and in 1940 by baer baer 40 we shall call this finite conjugacy property fcp and also call this theorem the fcp theorem we shall consider a further finiteness property that the group is a virtual p group i e it has a p subgroup with finite index it is easy to see that a virtual p group satisfies fcp for suppose g is a virtual p group then it has a p subgroup m of finite index and without loss of generality enlarging m if necessary we may suppose m is a sylow p subgroup the number of conjugates of m is given by the index g nm of its normalizer nm and since nm m this index is finite proving the fcp property on the other hand since any abelian group trivially satisfies fcp it is clear that fcp does not imply that the group is a virtual p group the next proposition gives us an easy way to identify a sylow p subgroup in a virtual p group and along with the lemma that follows it will make the proof of the main result theorem 4 8 below quite easy 4 6 proposition let g be a virtual p group and m a p subgroup then m is a sylow p subgroup if and only if g m is coprime to p proof supposem h g then g m g h h m if g m is coprime to p then it follows that h m is also coprime to p if also h is a p group this can only happen if h m 1 whence m is a maximal p subgroup and thus sylow conversely supposem 1 is a sylow p subgroup we have already argued above that any virtual p group g admits a sylow p subgroup m having finite index since g also satisfies fcp m m 1 are conjugate by the fcp theorem and hence have the same index in g so we can deal with m now g m g nm nm m all being finite numbers again by the fcp theorem g nm 1 mod p and is thus coprime to p since m e nm and is also a sylow p subgroup of nm it is easy to see that nm m is also coprime to p by considering the finite group nm m a which has order nm m and the surjection nm a the sylow p subgroup of a must be trivial otherwise its inverse image would be a p subgroup of nm 13 strictly larger than m the next lemma is a non commutative version of a result that is fa miliar in abelian categories where it follows at once by taking the quotient objects to form a third exact row in the diagram 4 7 lemma let g be any group m any subgroup and a surjective homomorphism of g onto a group h consider the commutative diagram k 1 m h 1 k g h m where k k 1 are the respective kernels of m and h 1 is the image of m then one has the following relation of possibly infinite cardinal numbers g m h h 1 k k 1 proof since k g it is standard cf rot 95 theorem 2 13 that km mk k m is a subgroup of g another standard fact is that g m g mk mk m cf rob 82 section 1 3 5 the plan of this proof is to show that g mk h h 1 and mk m k k 1 which will complete the proof for g mk let us first note that mk 1 h 1 then g mk h h 1 is part of hall 59 theorem 2 3 4 for mk m let k xik 1 be a coset decomposition of k where xi k i i and x 1 i xj k 1 if and only if i j by definition i k k 1 now consider xim mk now x 1 i xj m implies x 1 i xj k m k 1 which implies i j hence xim xim mk further if g mk km then g km xik 1 m for some k k m m and k xik 1 for some i i and some k 1 k 1 given k i and k 1 are unique thus g xi k 1 m xim showing that mk xim from which mk m i k k 1 4 8 corollary let g be a virtual p group then any normal subgroup k or any quotient group h is also a virtual p group proof given a normal subgroup k let h g k or given a quotient group h let k equal the kernel of the projection map g h also let m be a p subgroup of g with finite index this gives exactly the situation of lemma 4 6 and since g m is finite the lemma implies that both 14 k k 1 h h 1 are finite clearly k 1 and h 1 are p groups since m is a p group thus k and h are virtual p groups 4 9 theorem let g a b be a virtual p group a if m is a sylow p subgroup of g then m i is a sylow p subgroup of gi and mi is a sylow p subgroup of gi b conversely if n g has goursat quintuple n 1 n 1 n 2 n 2 n with n i a sylow p subgroup of gi and ni a sylow p subgroup of gi then n is a sylow p subgroup of g proof first for both parts of the proof notice that g being a virtual p group implies by remark 2 3 d and corollary 4 7 that gi and gi i gi i 1 2 are also virtual p groups a letm be a sylow p subgroup of g then g m is coprime to p by proposition 4 5 applying lemma 4 6 to remark 2 3 d with replaced by 1 h 1 h replaced respectively by m 1 g 1 and k 1 k replaced respectively up to isomorphism by m 2 g 2 we obtain g m g 1 m 1 g 2 m 2 hence g 1 m 1 g 2 m 2 are also coprime to p since m is a p group so are m 1 m 2 and since we have already observed that g 1 g 2 are virtual p groups proposition 4 5 implies that m 1 m 2 are respectively sylow p subgroups of g 1 g 2 the proof for m 2 m 1 is similar b conversely given the hypotheses of b n must first of all be a p group by proposition 4 1 c the steps for proving a above can now all be reversed to show that g n is coprime to p and hence by proposition 4 5 n is a sylow p subgroup of g using the correspondence between the symmetric and asymmetric ver sions of goursat s lemma section 2 and theorem 3 2 the generalization of theorem 4 8 to subgroups of a finite direct product is clear and we simply state it here without proof 4 10 theorem let g a 1 an be a virtual p group and have goursat decomposition qn g g 1 g 2 g 2 1 1 gn g n 1 n 1 n 1 as in theorem 3 2 a if m is a sylow p subgroup of g then m i is a sylow p subgroup of gi and m i 1 i 1 is a sylow p subgroup of g i 1 i 1 2 i n b conversely if n g has goursat 2 n 3 tuple n 1 n 2 n 2 1 1 n 3 n 3 1 2 2 nn n n 1 n 1 n 1 15 with each n i a sylow p subgroup of gi and each n i 1 i 1 a sylow p subgroup of g i 1 i 1 2 i n then n is a sylow p subgroup of g we close this section with two questions 4 11 remark a one can ask whether theorems 4 8 4 9 hold under the weaker hypothesis that g is an fcp group the answer is no let g be the infinite cyclic subgroup of z z 3 generated by 1 1 p 3 and recall that any abelian group satisfies fcp the sylow 3 subgroupm of g equals 0 hence m 1 0 whereas g 1 z 3 has sylow 3 subgroup z 3 b in corollary 4 7 we have seen that any normal subgroup of a virtual p group is also a virtual p group does this hold for any subgroup 5 appendix an example illustrating the neces sity of the asymmetric goursat lemma when moving from goursat s lemma to the asymmetric version of goursat s lemma in section 2 we used the first isomorphism theorem to show that the required isomorphism g 1 g 1 g 2 g 2 corresponds uniquely to a surjection 1 g 1 g 2 g 2 now that we have derived goursat s lemma for n 2 it is tempting to use analogous reasoning to try to obtain a symmetric version of the lemma for n 3 for n 3 such a lemma would make use of the three lattices of subgroups each subgroup being normal in the one above it and using the notation of section 3 g 1 g 2 g 3 g 1 2 g 1 3 g 2 3 g 2 1 g 3 1 g 3 2 g 1 2 3 g 2 1 3 g 3 1 2 together with the isomorphisms g 1 g 1 2 g 2 g 2 1 16 g 2 g 2 3 g 3 g 3 2 g 3 g 3 1 g 1 g 1 3 and also the isomorphisms g 1 3 g 1 2 3 g 2 3 g 2 1 3 g 2 1 g 2 1 3 g 3 1 g 3 1 2 g 3 2 g 3 1 2 g 1 2 g 1 2 3 the desired lemma would then state that this information uniquely deter mines the original subgroup g of a b c in fact this is not the case indeed we now give an example of two subspaces of the product a b c of three vector spaces each of dimension at least 2 say over r or q which generate all of the same data as given above but nevertheless are not the same subspace thereby showing that a symmetric version of the lemma for n 3 is impossible we remark that by applying forgetful functors this could also be considered as an example in the category of abelian groups as well as the category of groups choose linearly independent vectors a 1 and a 2 in a b 1 and b 2 in b and c 1 and c 2 in c consider the 3 dimensional subspace v span a 1 b 1 c 1 a 2 b 2 c 2 a 1 a 2 b 1 2 b 2 c 1 3 c 2 of a b c and similarly define a second 3 dimensional subspace by v span a 1 b 1 c 1 2 c 2 a 1 b 1 b 2 c 1 a 1 2 a 2 b 1 c 1 to compare these subspaces we determine the twelve subspaces and nine isomorphisms presented in the subspace lattice at the beginning of this sec tion for example we find that for the subspace v an element a b c of the subspace g 1 2 a a a 0 c v for some c c is determined by the existence of scalars x y and z such that a xa 1 ya 2 z a 1 a 2 and 0 xb 1 yb 2 z b 1 2 b 2 since b 1 and b 2 are linearly independent this leads us to the equations x z 0 and y 2 z 0 17 whose solutions are x y 2 z thus a xa 1 ya 2 z a 1 a 2 xa 2 and g 1 2 span a 2 in a similar fashion we find the following subspaces of v g 1 span a 1 a 2 g 2 span b 1 b 2 g 3 span c 1 c 2 g 1 2 span a 2 g 2 3 span b 2 g 3 1 span c 2 g 1 3 span a 2 g 2 1 span b 2 g 3 2 span c 2 g 1 2 3 0 g 2 1 3 0 g 3 1 2 0 if we are to generalize the method of goursat s lemma 2 1 the isomor phism is determined by a b where a b c v for some c c similarly a b where a b 0 v we write a rather than a since g 1 3 g 1 2 3 g 1 3 0 g 1 3 and likewise for b the other isomorphisms and are defined in the same manner the fact that this produces well defined isomorphisms is automatically determined by the definitions of the 12 subspaces in the subspace lattice we wish to very specifically determine these isomorphisms for v so that they can be compared to the data for v in this case a 1 b 1 since a 1 b 1 c 1 v and a 2 b 2 0 since a 2 b 2 c 2 v the other isomorphisms are determined similarly and we obtain a 1 b 1 b 1 c 1 c 1 b 1 a 2 0 b 2 0 c 2 0 a 2 b 2 2 b 2 3 c 2 c 2 a 2 the determination of a 2 for example is given by the fact that a 2 b 2 2 0 1 2 a 1 b 1 c 1 3 a 2 b 2 c 2 a 1 a 2 b 1 2 b 2 c 1 3 c 2 is a vector in v we leave it as an exercise for the reader to check that all twelve subspaces and six isomorphisms corresponding to the subspace v are exactly the same as those corresponding to v however the subspaces v and v are not the same we offer two ex planations first one can apply theorem 3 2 to the subspaces v and v when applying this theorem one sees from the computations above that g 1 g 2 g 2 1 1 g 3 and g 3 1 2 are the same for each of v and v however the homomorphisms 2 2 g 3 g 3 1 2 are not the same the subspace 2 of a b is determined by 2 a b a b c v resp v for some c c 18 and the homomorphism 2 is defined by 2 a b c where a b c v resp v for v one finds that a 1 b 1 2 with 2 a 1 b 1 c 1 since a 1 b 1 c 1 v however for v one finds that a 1 b 1 2 but 2 a 1 b 1 c 1 2 c 2 since a 1 b 1 c 1 2 c 2 v note that since g 3 1 2 0 for both v and v there is no indeterminacy so c 1 6 c 1 2 c 2 in g 3 by theorem 3 2 we now conclude that v 6 v a more elementary explanation is given by considering a particular case of the above example in which v and v are both in the grassmann manifold g 6 3 of 3 planes in r 6 r 2 r 2 r 2 let a b c r 2 and let a 1 b 1 c 1 1 0 and a 2 b 2 c 2 0 1 then the subspace v is the span of 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 2 0 3 in r 6 while v is the span of 1 0 1 0 1 2 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 2 1 0 1 0 the matrix 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 2 0 3 1 0 1 0 1 2 has rank 4 showing that the vector 1 0 1 0 1 2 of v is not in v thus v 6 v in this case this demonstrates that the symmetric version of goursat s lemma does not hold 5 1 remark upon trying to recover the symmetric version of goursat s lemma by applying the first isomorphism theorem to theorem 3 2 one sees almost immediately that the trouble stems from the fact that g 1 2 3 is not necessarily equal to the intersection of g 1 2 and g 1 3 and similarly for g 2 1 3 and g 2 1 3 it seems very likely that a symmetric version of goursat s lemma is available with this additional hypothesis references ac 09
