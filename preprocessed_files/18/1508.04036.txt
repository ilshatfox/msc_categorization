ar x iv 1 50 8 04 03 6 v 1 m at h c t 1 7 a ug 2 01 5 on adjoint and brain functors david ellerman philosophy department university of california at riverside abstract there is some consensus among orthodox category theorists that the concept of adjoint functors is the most important concept contributed to mathematics by category theory we give a heterodox treatment of adjoints using heteromorphisms object to object morphisms between objects of different categories that parses an adjunction into two separate parts left and right representations of heteromorphisms then these separate parts can be recombined in a new way to define a cognate concept the brain functor to abstractly model the functions of perception and action of a brain the treatment uses relatively simple category theory and is focused on the interpretation and application of the mathematical concepts the mathematical appendix is of general interest to category theorists as it is a defense of the use

are all umps part of adjunctions 16 1 http arxiv org abs 1508 04036 v 1 1 category theory in the life and cognitive sciences there is already a considerable but widely varying literature on the application of category theory to the life and cognitive sciences such as the work of robert rosen 31 32 and his followers 1 as well as andre e ehresmann and jean paul vanbremeersch 4 and their commentators 2 the approach taken here is based on a specific use of the characteristic concepts of category theory namely universal mapping properties one such approach in the literature is that of franc ois magnan and gonzalo reyes which emphasizes that category theory provides means to circumscribe and study what is universal in mathematics and other scientific disciplines 26 p 57 their intended field of application is cognitive science we may even suggest that universals of the mind may be expressed by means of universal properties in the theory of categories and much of the work done up to now in this area seems to bear out this suggestion by discussing the process of counting in some detail we give evidence that this universal ability of the human mind may be conveniently conceptualized in terms of this theory of universals which is category theory 26 p 59 another current approach that emphasizes universal mapping properties universal construc tions is that of s phillips w h wilson and g s halford 10 30 29 in addition to the focus on universals the approach here is distinctive in the use of heteromorphisms which are object to object morphisms between objects if different categories in contrast to the usual homomorphisms or homs between objects in the same category by explicitly adding heteromor phisms to the usual homs only presentation of category theory this approach can directly represent interactions between the objects of different categories intuitively between an organism and the environment but it is still early days and many approaches need to be tried to find out where theory lives 2 the ubiquity and importance of adjoints before developing the concept of a brain functor we need to consider the related concept of a pair of adjoint functors an adjunction the developers of category theory saunders maclane and samuel eilenberg famously said that categories were defined in order to define functors and functors were defined in order to define natural transformations 5 a few years later the concept of universal constructions or universal mapping properties was isolated 23 and 34 adjoints were defined a decade later by daniel kan 15 and the realization of their ubiquity adjoint functors arise everywhere 24 p v and their foundational importance has steadily increased over time lawvere 18 and lambek 17 now it would perhaps not be too much of an exaggeration to see categories functors and natural transformations as the prelude to defining adjoint functors as steven awodey put it the notion of adjoint functor applies everything that we have learned up to now to unify and subsume all the different universal mapping properties that we have encountered from free groups to limits to exponentials but more importantly it also captures an important mathematical phenomenon that is invisible without the lens of category theory indeed i will make the admittedly provocative claim that adjointness is a concept of fundamental logical and mathematical importance that is not captured elsewhere in mathematics 1 p 179 1 see 38 20 and 21 and their references 2 see 14 for kainen s comments on the ehresmann vanbremeersch approach kainen s own approach and a broad bibliography of relevant papers 2 other category theorists have given similar testimonials to some including this writer adjunction is the most important concept in category theory 37 p 6 the isolation and explication of the notion of adjointness is perhaps the most profound contribution that category theory has made to the history of general mathematical ideas 9 p 438 nowadays every user of category theory agrees that adjunction is the concept which justifies the fundamental position of the subject in mathematics 36 p 367 3 adjoints and universals how do the ubiquitous and important adjoint functors relate to the universal constructions mac lane and birkhoff succinctly state the idea of the universals of category theory and note that adjunctions can be analyzed in terms of those universals the construction of a new algebraic object will often solve a specific problem in a uni versal way in the sense that every other solution of the given problem is obtained from this one by a unique homomorphism the basic idea of an adjoint functor arises from the analysis of such universals 25 p v we can use some old language from plato s theory of universals to describe those universals of category theory ellerman 6 that solve a problem in a universal or paradigmatic way so that every other solution of the given problem is obtained from this one in a unique way in plato s theory of ideas or forms a property f has an entity associated with it the universal uf which uniquely represents the property an object x has the property f i e f x if and only if iff the object x participates in the universal uf let from or methexis represent the participation relation so x uf reads as x participates in uf given a relation an entity uf is said to be a universal for the property f with respect to if it satisfies the following universality condition for any x x uf if and only if f x a universal representing a property should be in some sense unique hence there should be an equivalence relation so that universals satisfy a uniqueness condition if uf and u f are universals for the same f then uf u f the two criteria for a theory of universals is that it contains a binary relation and an equiv alence relation so that with certain properties f there are associated entities uf satisfying the following conditions 1 universality condition for any x x uf iff f x and 2 uniqueness condition if uf and u f are universals for the same f i e satisfy 1 then uf u f a universal uf is said to be non self predicative if it does not participate in itself i e uf uf a universal uf is self predicative if it participates in itself i e uf uf 3 for the sets in an iterative 3 a self predicative universal for some property is thus an impredicative definition of having that property see 21 p 245 where a supremum or least upper bound is referred to as giving an impredicative definition of being an upper bound of a subset of a partial order also michael makkai 27 makes a similiar remark about the universal mapping property of the natural number system 3 set theory boolos 3 set membership is the participation relation set equality is the equivalence relation and those sets are never self predicative since the set of instances of a property is always of higher type or rank than the instances the universals of category theory form the other bookend as always self predicative universals the set theoretical paradoxes arose from trying to have one theory of universals frege s paradise where the universals could be either self predicative or non self predicative 4 instead of having two opposite bookend theories one for never self predicative universals set theory and one for always always self predicative universals category theory for the self predicative universals of category theory see 25 or 24 for introductions the participation relation is the uniquely factors through relation it can always be formulated in a suitable category as x uf means there exists a unique arrow x uf then x is said to uniquely factor through uf and the arrow x uf is the unique factor or participation morphism in the universality condition for any x x uf if and only if f x the existence of the identity arrow 1 uf uf uf is the self participation of the self predicative universal that corresponds with f uf the self predication of the property to uf in category theory the equivalence relation used in the uniqueness condition is the isomorphism 4 the hom set definition of an adjunction we will later use a specific heterodox treatment of adjunctions first developed by pareigis 28 and later rediscovered and developed by ellerman 7 8 which shows that adjoints arise by gluing together in a certain way two universals left and right representations but for illustration we start with the standard hom set definition of an adjunction the category sets has all sets as objects and all functions between sets as the homomorphisms so for sets a and a hom a a is the set of functions a a in the product category sets sets the objects are ordered pairs of sets a b and homomorphism a b a b is just a pair of functions f g where f a a and g b b for an example of an adjunction consider the product functor sets sets sets which takes a pair of sets a b to their cartesian product a b set of ordered pairs of elements from a and b and takes a homomorphism f g a b a b to f g a b a b where for x a and y b f g x y 7 f x g y the maps f a a in sets go from one set to one set and the maps f g a b a b in sets sets go from a pair of sets to a pair of sets there is also the idea of a cone f g c a b of maps that is a pair of maps f c a and g c b going from one set c the point of the cone in sets to a pair of sets a b the base of the cone in sets sets before the notion of a adjunction was defined by kan 15 the product of sets a b was defined by its universal mapping property the projection maps a a b a and b a b b define a canonical cone a b a b a b that is universal in the following sense given any other cone f g c a b from any set c to a b there is a unique homomorphism f g c a b in sets such that the two triangles in the following diagram commute 4 then the universal for all the non self predicative universals would give rise to russell s paradox since it could not be self predicative or non self predicative russell 33 p 80 4 figure 1 universal mapping property for the product of sets in terms of the self predicative universals considered in the last section the property in question is the property of being a cone f g c a b to a b from any set c the canonical cone of projections a b a b a b is the self predicative universal for that property the participation relation f g a b is defined as uniquely factoring through as in figure 1 the universal mapping property of the product can then be restated as the universality condition for any cone f g from any set to a pair of sets f g a b if and only if f g is a cone to a b ump of a b stated as a universality condition the hom set definition of the adjunction for the product functor uses the auxiliary device of a diagonal functor to avoid mentioning the cones and to restrict attention only to the hom sets of the two categories the diagonal functor sets sets sets in the opposite direction of the product functor just doubles everything so c c c and f f f then the product functor is said to be the right adjoint of the diagonal functor the diagonal functor is said to be the left adjoint of the product functor and the two functors together form an adjunction if there is a natural isomorphism between the hom sets as follows homsets sets c a b homsets c a b hom set definition of the adjunction between the product and diagonal functors the diagonal functor sets sets sets also has a rather trivial ump that can be stated in terms of cones c a b except now we fix c and let a b vary there is the canoncial cone 1 c 1 c c c c and it is universal in the following sense for any cone f g c a b from the given c to any pair of sets a b there is a unique homomorphism in sets sets namely f g c c a b that factors through the canonical cone c c c figure 2 universal mapping property for diagonal functor this product diagonal adjunction illustrates the general hom set definition given functors f x a and g a x going each way between categories x and a they form an adjunction if there is a natural isomorphism for objects x x and a a 5 homa f x a homx x g a hom set definition of an adjunction to further analyze adjoints we need the notion of a heteromorphism 5 heteromorphisms and adjunctions we have seen that there are two umps often one is trivial like c in the above example involved in an adjunction and that the object to object maps were always within one category e g in the hom sets of one category or the other using object to object maps between objects of different categories properly called heteromorphisms or chimera morphisms the notion of an adjunction can be factored into two representations or half adjunctions in ellerman 7 p 158 each of which expresses a universal mapping property we have already seen one standard example of a heteromorphism or het namely a cone f g c a b that goes from an object in sets to an object in sets sets the hets are contrasted with the homs or homomorphisms between objects in the same category to keep them separate in our notation we will henceforth use single arrows for hets and double arrows for homs 5 then the ump for the product functor can be represented as follows figure 3 ump for the product functor it should be particularly noted that this het formulation of the ump for the product does not involve the diagonal functor if we associate with each c sets and each a b sets sets the set het c a b of cones or hets f g c a b then this defines a het bifunctor in the same manner as the usual hom bifunctor homsets a a or homsets sets a b a b see the appendix for more details then the ump for the product functor gives a natural isomorphism based on the pairing f g 7 f g so that the sets valued functor het c a b is said to be represented on the right by the sets valued homsets c a b het c a b homsets c a b right representation of the hets c a b by the homs c a b the trivial ump for the diagonal functor can also be stated in terms of the cone hets without reference to the product functor 5 the hets between objects of different categories are represented as single arrows while the homomorphisms or homs between objects in the same category are represented by double arrows the functors between whole categories are also represented by single arrows one must be careful not to confuse a functor f x a from a category x to a category a with its action on an object x x which would be symbolized x 7 f x moreover since a functor often has a canonical definition there may well be a canonical het x f x or x f x but such hets are no part of the definition of the functor itself 6 figure 4 ump for the diagonal functor this ump for the diagonal functor gives a natural isomorphism based on the pairing f g 7 f g so the sets valued functor het c a b is said to be represented on the left by the sets valued homsets sets c c a b homsets sets c c a b het c a b left representation of the hets c a b by the homs c c a b then the right and left representations of the hets het c a b can be combined to obtain as a consequence the hom set definition of the adjunction between the product and diagonal functors homsets sets c c a b het c a b homsets c a b heteromorphic presentation of the product diagonal adjunction in the general case of adjoint functors f x a g the hets het x a from objects x x to objects a a have left and right representations homa f x a het x a homx x g a heteromorphic presentation of a general adjunction this is the heterodox treatment of an adjunction first published by pareigis 28 pp 60 1 and later rediscovered and developed by the author 7 p 130 and 8 it is heterodox since the morphisms between the objects of different categories are not officially recognized in the standard presentations of category theory e g 24 or 1 even though such hets are a common part of mathematical practice see the appendix for further discussion hence the standard hom set definition of an adjunction just deletes the het middle term het x a to obtain just the het free or homs only presentation of an adjunction the important advance of the heteromorphic treatment of an adjunction is that the adjunction can be parsed or factored into two parts the left and right representations each of which only involves one of the hom functors figure 5 left and right representations each involving on one of the adjoints f and g moreover the diagrams for the two representations can be glued together at the diagonal het f into one diagram to give the simple adjunctive square diagram for an adjunction 7 figure 6 adjunctive square diagram for the het treatment of an adjunction every adjunction can be represented up to isomorphism in this manner 7 p 147 so the molecule of an adjunction can be split into two atoms each of which is a left or right representation of a het functor this means that the importance and ubiquity of adjunctions emphasized above also passes to the atoms left or right representations that make up those molecules moreover it should be noted that each left or right representation defines a self predicative universal as indicated in the previous example of the het cones c a b the main point of this paper is that those atoms the left and right representations can be recombined in a new way to define a recombinant construction cognate to an adjunction and that is the concept of a brain functor 6 brain functors in many adjunctions the important fact is expressed by either the left or right representation e g the ump for the product functor or for the free group functor considered in the appendix with no need for the auxiliary device such as a diagonal or forgetful functor of the other representation used to express the adjunction in a het free manner another payoff from analyzing the important but molecular concept of an adjunction into two atomic representations is that we can then reassemble those atomic parts in a new way to define the cognate concept speculatively named a brain functor the basic intuition is to think of one category x in a representation as the environment and the other category a as an organism instead of representations within each category of the hets going one way between the categories as in an adjunction suppose the hets going both ways were represented within one of the categories the organism intuitively a het from the environment to the organism is say a visual or auditory stimulus then a left representation would play the role of the brain in providing the re cognition or perception expressed by the intentionality of perception slogan seeing is seeing as of the stimulus as a perception of say a tree where the internal re cognition is represented by the homomorphism inside the organism category 8 figure 7 perceiving brain presented as a left representation perhaps not surprisingly this mathematically models the old philosophical theme in the platonic tradition that external stimuli do not give knowledge the stimuli only trigger the internal perception recognition or recollection as in plato s meno that is knowledge in de magistro the teacher the neo platonic christian philosopher augustine of hippo developed an argument in the form of a dialogue with his son adeodatus that as teachers teach it is only the student s internal appropriation of what is taught that gives understanding then those who are called pupils consider within themselves whether what has been explained has been said truly looking of course to that interior truth according to the measure of which each is able thus they learn but men are mistaken so that they call those teachers who are not merely because for the most part there is no delay between the time of speaking and the time of cognition and since after the speaker has reminded them the pupils quickly learn within they think that they have been taught outwardly by him who prompts them augustine de magistro chapter xiv the basic point is the active role of the mind in generating understanding represented by the internal hom this is clear even at the simple level of understanding spoken words we hear the auditory sense data of words in a completely strange language as well as the words in our native language but the strange words bounce off our minds like with no resultant understanding while the words in a familiar language prompt an internal process of generating a meaning so that we understand the words thus it could be said that understanding a language means there is a left representation for the heard statements in that language but there is no such internal re cognition mechanism for the heard auditory inputs in a strange language dually there are also hets going the other way from the organism to the environment and there is a similar distinction between mere behavior e g a reflex and an action that expresses an intention mathematically that is described by dualizing or turning the arrows around which gives an acting brain presented as a right representation 9 figure 8 acting brain as a right representation in the heteromorphic treatment of adjunctions an adjunction arises when the hets from one category x to another category a het x a for x x and a a have a right representation het x a homx x g a and a left representation homa f x a het x a but instead of taking the same set of hets as being represented by two different functors on the right and left suppose we consider a single functor b x that represents the hets het x a on the left het x a homa b x a and represents the hets het a x going in the opposite direction on the right homa a b x het a x if the hets each way between two categories are represented by the same functor b x as left and right representations then that functor is said to be a brain functor thus instead of a pair of functors being adjoint we have a single functor b x with values within one of the categories the organism as representing the two way interactions perception and action between that category and another one the environment the use of the adjective brain is quite deliberate as opposed to say mind since the universal hets going each way between the organism and environment are part of the definition of left and right representations in particular it should be noted how the turn around the arrows category theoretic duality provides a mathematical model for the type of duality between sensory or afferent systems brain furnishing the left representation of the environment to organism heteromorphisms and motor or efferent systems brain furnishing the right representation of the organism to envi ronment heteromorphisms in view of this application those two universal hets representing the afferent and efferent nervous systems might be denoted x and x as in the following diagrams for the two representations figure 9 left and right representation diagrams for the brain functor b x a we have seen how the adjunctive square diagram for an adjunction can be obtained by gluing together the left and right representation diagrams at the common diagonal f the diagram for a brain functor is obtained by gluing together the diagrams for the left and right representations at the common values of the brain functor b x if we think of the diagram for a representation as right triangle then the adjunctive square diagram is obtained by gluing two triangles together on the hypotenuses and the diagram for the brain functor is obtained by gluing two triangles together at the right angle vertices to form the butterfly diagram 10 figure 10 butterfly diagram combining two representations at the common b x if both the triangular wings could be filled out as adjunctive squares then the brain functor would have left and right adjoints thus all functors with both left and right adjoints are brain functors although not vice versa the previous example of the diagonal functor sets sets sets is a brain functor since the product functor a b a b is the right adjoint and the coproduct or disjoint union functor a b a b is the left adjoint the underlying set functor see appendix that takes a group g to its underlying set u g is a rather trivial example of a brain functor that does not arise from having both a left and right adjoint it has a left adjoint the free group functor so u provides a right representation for the set to group maps or hets x g also it trivially provides a left representation for the hets g x but has no right adjoint in the butterfly diagram below we have labelled the diagram for the brain as the language faculty for understanding and producing speech figure 11 brain functor butterfly diagram interpreted as language faculty wilhelm von humboldt recognized the symmetry between the speaker and listener which in the same person is abstractly represented as the dual functions of the selfsame power of the language faculty in the above butterfly diagram nothing can be present in the mind seele that has not originated from one s own activity moreover understanding and speaking are but different effects of the selfsame power of speech speaking is never comparable to the transmission of mere matter stoff in the person comprehending as well as in the speaker the subject matter must be developed by the individual s own innate power what the listener receives is merely the harmonious vocal stimulus 11 p 102 11 7 a mathematical example of a brain functor a non trivial mathematical example of a brain functor is provided by the functor taking a finite set of vector spaces vi i 1 n over the same field or r modules over a ring r to the product i vi of the vector spaces such a product is also the coproduct i vi 12 p 173 and that space may be written as the biproduct v 1 vn ivi i vi the het from a set of spaces vi to a single space v is a cocone of vector space maps vi v and the canonical such het is the set of canonical injections vi v 1 vn taking the brain as a coproduct with the brain at the point of the cocone the perception left representation then might be taken as conceptually representing the function of the brain as integrating multiple sensory inputs into an interpreted perception 6 figure 12 brain as integrating sensory inputs into a perception dually a het from single space v to a set of vector spaces vi is a cone v vi with the single space v at the point of the cone and the canonical het is the set of canonical projections taking the brain as a product with the brain as the point of the cone v 1 vn v i the action right representation then might be taken as conceptually representing the function of the brain as integrating or coordinating multiple motor outputs in the performance of an action figure 13 brain as coordinating motor outputs into an action putting the two representations together gives the butterfly diagram for a brain 6 the cocones and cones are represented in the diagrams using cone shapes 12 figure 14 conceptual model of a perceiving and acting brain this gives a conceptual model of a single organ that integrates sensory inputs into a perception and coordinates motor outputs into an action i e a brain 8 conclusion in view of the success of category theory in modern mathematics it is perfectly natural to try to apply it in the life and cognitive sciences many different approaches need to be tried to see which ones if any will find where theory lives and will be something more than just applying biological names to bits of pure math the approach developed here differs from other approaches in several ways but the most basic difference is the use of heteromorphisms to represent interactions between quite different entities i e objects in different categories heteromorphisms also provide the natural setting to formulate universal mapping problems and their solutions as left or right representations of hets in spite of abounding in the wilds of mathematical practice hets are not recognized in the orthodox presentations of category theory one consequence is that the notion of an adjunction appears as one atomic concept that cannot be factored into separate parts but that is only a artifact of the homs only treatment the heteromorphic treatment shows that an adjunction factors naturally into a left and right representation of the hets going from one category to another where in general one representation might exist without the other one benefit of this heteromorphic factorization is that the two atomic concepts of left and right representations can then be recombined in a new way to form the cognate recombinant concept of a brain functor the main conclusion of the paper is that this concept of a brain functor seems to fit very well as an abstract and conceptual but non trivial description of the dual universal functions of a brain perception using the sensory or afferent systems and action using the motor or efferent systems 9 mathematical appendix are hets really necessary in cat egory theory since the concept of a brain functor requires hets for its formulation it is important to consider the role of hets in category theory the homomorphisms or homs between the objects of a category x are given by a hom bifunctor homx x op x sets in the same manner the heteromorphisms 13 or hets from the objects of a category x to the objects of a category a are given by a het bifunctor het xop a sets 7 the het bifunctor gives the rigorous way to handle the composition of a het f x a in het x a thin arrows for hets with a homomorphism or hom g x x in x thick arrows for homs and a hom h a a in a for instance the composition x g x f a is the het that is the image of f under the map het g a het x a het x a similarly the composition x f a h a is the het that is the image of f under the map het x h het x a het x a 8 figure 15 composition of a het with a hom on either end this is all perfectly analogous to the use of hom functors to define the composition of homs since both homs and hets e g injection of generators into a group are common morphisms used in mathematical practice both types of bifunctors formalize standard mathematical machinery 9 1 chimeras in the wilds of mathematical practice the homs only orientation may go back to the original conception of category theory as a con tinuation of the klein erlanger programm in the sense that a geometrical space with its group of transformations is generalized to a category with its algebra of mappings 5 p 237 while chimeras do not appear in the orthodox ontological zoo of category theory they abound in the wilds of mathematical practice in spite of the reference to working mathematician in the title of maclane s text 24 one might seriously doubt that any working mathematician would give say the universal mapping property of free groups using the device of the underlying set functor u instead of the traditional description given in the left representation diagram which does not even mention u as can be seen in most any non category theoretic text that treats free groups for instance consider the following description in nathan jacobson s text 13 p 69 to summarize given the set x x 1 xr we have obtained a map xi x i of x into a group fg r such that if g is any group and xi ai 1 i r is any map of x into g then we have a unique homomorphism of fg r into g making the following diagram commutative 7 although often with a somewhat different interpretation the sets valued profunctors 16 distributors 2 or correspondences 22 p 96 are formally the same as het bifunctors 8 the definition of a bifunctor also insures the associativity of composition so that schematically hom het hom hom het hom 14 x fg r g in jacobson s diagram only the fg r g morphism is a group homomorphism the vertical and diagonal arrows are called maps and are set to group hets so it is the diagram for a left representation 9 9 2 hets as homs in a collage category the notion of a homomorphism is so general that hets can always be recast as homs in a larger category variously called a directly connected category 28 p 58 since pareigis calls the het bifunctor a connection a cograph category 35 or more colloquially a collage category since it combines quite different types of objects and morphisms into one category in total disregard of any connection to the erlangen program the collage category of a het bifunctor het xop a sets denoted x heta 22 p 96 has as objects the disjoint union of the objects of x and a the homs of the collage category are defined differently according to the two types of objects for x and x objects in x the homs x x are the elements of homx x x the hom bifunctor for x and similarly for objects a and a in a the homs a a are the elements of homa a a for the different types of objects such as x from x and a from a the homs x a are the elements of het x a and there are no homs a x in the other direction in the collage category does the collage category construction show that hets are unnecessary in category theory and that homs suffice since all the information given in the het bifunctor has been repackaged in the collage category any use of hets can always be repackaged as a use of the x to a homs in the collage category x heta in any application like the previous example of the universal mapping property ump of the free group functor as a left representation one must distinguish between the two types of objects and the three types of homs in the collage category suppose in jacobson s example one wanted to avoid having the different maps and group homomorphisms by formulating the left representation in the collage category formed from the category of sets the category of groups grps and the het bifunctor het setsop grps sets for set to group maps since the ump does not hold for arbitrary objects and homs in the collage category sets hetgrps one would have to differentiate between the set type objects x and the group type objects g as well as between the mixed type homs in hom x g and the pure type homs in hom fg r g then the left representation ump of the free group functor could be formulated in the het free collage category sets hetgrps as follows for every set type object x there is a group type object f x and a mixed type hom x x f x such that for any mixed type hom f x g from the set type object x to any group type object g there is a unique pure type hom f f x g such that f f x thus the answer to the question are hets really necessary is no since one can always use sufficient circumlocutions with the different types of homs in a collage category jokes aside the collage category formulation is essentially only a reformulation of the left representation ump using clumsy circumlocutions working mathematicians use phrases like mappings or morphisms to refer to hets in contrast to homomorphisms and mixed type homs does not seem to be improved phraseology for hets there is however a more substantive point i e the general umps of left or right representations show that the hets between objects of different categories can be represented by homs within the codomain category or within the domain category respectively if one conflates the hets and homs 9 we modified jacobson s diagram according to our het hom convention for the arrows similar examples of hets can be found in the maclane birkhoff s text 25 15 in a collage category then the point of the representation is rather obscured since it is then one set of homs in a collage category being represented by another set of homs in the same category 9 3 what about the homs only umps in adjunctions there is another het avoidance device afoot in the homs only treatment of adjunctions for in stance the left representation ump of the free group functor can for each x sets be formu lated as the natural isomorphism homgrps f x g het x g but if we fix g and use the underlying set functor u grps sets then there is trivially the right representation het x g homsets x u g putting the two representations together we have the hetero morphic treatment of an adjunction first formulated by pareigis 28 homgrps f x g het x g homsets x u g if we delete the het middle term then we have the usual homs only formulation of the free group adjunction homgrps f x g homsets x u g without any mention of hets moreover the het avoidance device of the underlying set functor u allows the ump of the free group functor to be reformulated with sufficient circumlocutions to avoid mentioning hets for each set x there is a group f x and a set hom x x u f x such that for any set hom f x u g from the set x to the underlying set u g of any group g there is a unique group hom f f x g over in the other category such that the set hom image u f of the group hom f back in the original category satisfies f u f x 10 figure 16 over and back diagram for free group adjunction such het avoidance circumlocutions have no structural significance since there is a general ad junction representation theorem 7 p 147 that all adjoints can be represented up to isomorphism as arising from the left and right representations of a het bifunctor 9 4 are all umps part of adjunctions even though the homs only formulation of an adjunction only ignores the underlying hets due to the adjunction representation theorem is that formulation sufficient to give all umps or are there important universal constructions that are not either left or right adjoints 10 even the over and back formulation using two different categories could be avoided by using the further cir cumlocutions of the only pure type homs in the single collage category 16 probably the most important example is the tensor product the universal mapping property of the tensor product is particularly interesting since it is a case where the heteromorphic treatment of the ump is forced under one disguise or another the tensor product functor a b 7 a b is not a left adjoint so the usual device of using the other functor e g a forgetful or diagonal functor to avoid mentioning hets is not available for a b c modules over some commutative ring r one category is the product category modr modr where the objects are ordered pairs a b of r modules and the other category is just the category modr of r modules the values of the het bifunctor het a b c are the bilinear functions a b c then the tensor product functor modr modr modr given by a b 7 a b gives a left representation hommodr a b c het a b c that characterizes the tensor product the canonical het a b a b a b is the image under the left representation isomorphism of the identity hom 1 a b obtained by taking c a b so we have a b a b f a b f c left representation diagram to characterize tensor products where the single arrows are the bilinear hets and the thick arrow is a module homomorphism within the category modr for instance in maclane and birkhoff s algebra textbook 25 they explicitly use hets bilinear functions starting with the special case of an r module a for a commutative ring r and then stating the universal mapping property of the tensor product a r a using the left representation diagram 25 p 318 like any other working mathematicians for any r module a there is an r module a r and a canonical bilinear het h 0 a r a r such that given any bilinear het h a r c to an r module c there is a unique r module hom t a r c such that the following diagram commutes a r h 0 h a r t c left representation diagram of special case of tensor product references 1 awodey steve 2006 category theory oxford clarendon press 2 be
