pointwise remez inequality b eichinger and p yuditskii july 6 2020 dedicated a aptekarev on the occasion of his 65 th birthday abstract the standard well known remez inequality gives an upper estimate of the val ues of polynomials on 1 1 if they are bounded by 1 on a subset of 1 1 of fixed lebesgue measure the extremal solution is given by the rescaled chebyshev polynomials for one interval andrievskii asked about the maximal value of poly nomials at a fixed point if they are again bounded 1 on a set of fixed size we show that the extremal polynomials are either chebyshev one interval or akhiezer polynomials two intervals and prove totik widom bounds for the extremal value thereby providing a complete asymptotic solution to the andrievskii problem 1 introduction based on several results by t erde lyi e b saff and himself 5 6 12 13 v andrivskii posed the following problem problem 1 1 let pn be the collection of polynomials of degree at most n let e be a closed subset of 1 1 and e denote its lebesgue measure for x 0 1 1 define mn x 0 e sup pn x 0 pn pn pn x 1 for x e 1 1 for 0 1 find ln x 0 sup mn x 0 e e such that e 2 2 1 2 let us comment the setting with the following three evident remarks 1 ln x 0 is even thus we will consider only x 0 1 0 supported by the austrian science fund fwf project no j 4138 n 32 supported by the austrian science fund fwf project no p

interval 1 2 1 i e ln tn 1 1 rn x tn x 1 where tn denotes the standard chebyshev polynomial of degree n associated to 1 1 tn x 1 2 x x 2 1 n x x 2 1 n we will henceforth call rn the remez polynomial 3 clearly for problem 1 1 rn x can not be extremal for all x 0 1 0 as soon as is sufficiently small let 1 2 then rn 1 2 0 1 while for the so called akhiezer polynomial a 2 m x we get a 2 m 1 2 0 tm 5 3

approximation theory 2018 the third remark highlights that the problem is non trivial we found it highly interesting and in this paper we provide its complete asymptotic solution in 1 2 akhiezer studied various extremal problems for polynomials bounded on two disjoint intervals e 1 1 1 0 see also 3 appendix section 36 and section 38 in german translation definition 1 2 we say that a polynomial an x is the akhiezer polynomial in e with respect to the internal gap if it solves the following extremal problem an x 0 sup pn x 0 pn pn pn x 1 for x e 1 3 where x 0 we describe properties of akhiezer polynomials in section 2 1 note in particular that the extremal property of an x does not depend on which point x 0 was fixed in 1 3 in section 3 we prove the following theorem theorem 1 3 the extremal value ln x 0 is assumed either on the remez polynomial rn x or on an akhiezer polynomial an x with a suitable 2 our main result the asymptotic behaviour of ln x 0 is presented in section 4 akhiezer provided asymptotics for his polynomials associated to two intervals in terms of elliptic functions although the concept of the complex green function is used already in 1 nowadays the language of potential theory is so common and widely accepted see e g 6 8 10 16 24 that we will formulate our asymptotic result using this terminology let g z z 0 be the green function in the domain c e with respect to z 0 in particular we set g z g z respectively g z is the green function of the domain c e with respect to infinity where e 1 2 1 it is well known that rn x eng x e ng x 2 x 1 1 2 1 4 and lim 1 g x g x x 1 1 2 1 5 lemma 1 4 let x be the upper envelope x sup 1 0 g x 1 6 if for x 0 the supremum is attained for some internal point 1 0 then x 0 x 0 is a unique solution of the equation g x 0 otherwise it is attained as 1 and x 0 g x 0 note that the only nontrivial claim in lemma 1 4 is the uniqueness of x 0 we will provide a proof of this fact in section 4 2 und use it to give a description of the upper envelope x 0 in proposition 4 2 our main theorem below shows that the asymptotics of ln x 0 are described by the upper envelope x 0 theorem 1 5 the following limit exists lim n 1 n log 2 ln x 0 x 0 to be more precise if x 0 g x 0 then log 2 ln x 0 n x 0 o 1 1 7 if x 0 g x 0 for some 1 0 then the totik widom bound log 2 ln x 0 n x 0 o 1 1 8 holds 3 2 preliminaries in 23 the sharp constant in the remez inequality for trigonometric polynomials on the unit circle was given the proof was based on the following two steps i the structure of possible extremal polynomials was revealed with the help of their comb representations ii the principle of harmonic measure a monotonic dependence on a domain exten sion allows to get an extremal configuration for the comb parameters in the given problem we also start with recalling comb representations for extremal polynomials see subsection 2 1 we refer the reader to 14 22 and the references therein for more infor mation about the use of comb mappings in approximation theory however we doubt that the step ii is applicable to the andievskii problem that is that comparably sim ple arguments from potential theory such as the principle of harmonic measure would also allow us to bring a certain fixed configuration comb to an extremal one instead we develop here an infinitesimal approach closely related to the ideas of loewner chains 9 19 using this method we will prove in section 3 that the extremal solution for ln x 0 is either a chebyshev or an akhiezer polynomial for this reason we continue in subsection 2 3 with the complete discussion of akhiezer polynomials an see 1 3 recall that an is extremal on two given intervals with respect to points x 0 up to some trivial degenerations it is different to the classical chebyshev polynomial related to the same set since the latter one is extremal for points x 0 r 1 1 generically a 1 n 1 1 is a union of three intervals the set contains also an additional interval outside of 1 1 we demonstrate our infinitesimal approach showing dependence of this additional interval on for fixed n and in the language of comb domains we will observe a rather involved dependence of the comb parameters in a simple monotonic motion of the domain can undergo all possible variations to narrow expand or a combination of both see theorem 2 14 essentially this is the base for our believe that simple arguments in the spirit of ii in the andrievskii problem are hardly possible if for fixed x 0 the extremal polynomial is a remez polynomial there is no additional interval outside of 1 1 intuitively the same considerations as were used in 23 should work however a technical difference prevents a direct applications of the principle of harmonic measure namely the lebesgue measure on the circle corresponds to the harmonic measure evaluated at 0 while in the sense of potential theory the lebesgue measure on r corresponds to the martin or phragme n lindelo f measure 17 although we are convinced that a limiting process would allow to overcome this technical issue we provide an alternative proof below cf lemma 2 5 4 2 1 comb representation for extremal polynomials by a regular comb we mean a half strip with a system of vertical slits z re z n n im z 0 z k iy y 0 hk k n n where n n n n and the k s are integers we call hk hk 0 the height of the k th slit and point out that the degeneration hk 0 is possible let c be a conformal mapping of the upper half plane onto a regular comb such that then tn z cos z 2 1 defines a polynomial of degree n let e 1 1 be compact and x 0 1 1 e moreover let a b denote the maximal open interval in r e that contains x 0 then using the technique of markov correction terms we obtain the following representation of the extremizer of 1 1 theorem 2 1 22 7 5 basic theorem 11 theorem 3 2 under the normalization tn x 0 0 there exists a unique extremal polynomial for 1 1 and it only depends on the gap a b and not on the particular point x 0 a b moreover let c be a comb mapping onto a regular comb and e be such that i h 0 0 and a 1 0 b 1 0 ii e contains at least one of the points 1 k 0 for all k n n iii e contains at least one of the points 1 n 1 n then tn z cos z 2 2 is an extremal polynomial for e and the interval a b vice versa if tn is an extremal polynomial for a set e and an interval a b then there exists a regular comb with these properties such that 2 2 holds let us now specify to the case of akhiezer polynomials where e e 1 1 by the above theorem the so called n extension en en a 1 n 1 1 can be of the following types i there is an additional interval to the right of 1 ii e is extended at 1 iii e is extended at 1 iv there is an additional interval to the left of 1 the corresponding comb mapping realization is collected in the following corollary 5 corollary 2 2 for a fixed set e e and degree n the extremal polynomial an z of 1 1 is of the form 2 2 the unique comb n has one of four possible shapes shown in figure 1 and 2 moreover the following normalizations distinguish the cases i 1 n 1 1 n 1 0 1 see figure 1 left ii 1 n 0 1 1 n 1 n see figure 1 right iii 1 n n 1 1 n 0 1 see figure 2 left iv 1 n 1 0 1 1 n 1 see figure 2 right remark 2 3 let us denote the additional interval for the cases i and iv by in these cases include the limit cases hn 1 and hn 1 respectively that is the extremal polynomial is of the degree n 1 note that an has a zero on in the aforementioned degeneration corresponds to the zero being at on the other hand also the degenerations hn 1 0 and hn 1 0 are possible which allow for a smooth transition to the cases ii and iii respectively 2 2 reduction to remez polynomials as we have mentioned in the beginning of this section we cannot use the ideas of harmonic measure directly we overcome this technical problem by using transition functions from the theory of loewner chains 9 19 let us consider an arbitrary regular comb 0 as in theorem 2 1 and let us fix a slit with height hk 0 let hk be strictly monotonically decreasing such that hk 0 hk and be the comb which coincides with but hk is reduced to hk let and be the corresponding comb mappings then clearly and thus the transition function w z w z 1 z is well defined and is an analytic map from c into c if we define i 1 k ihk k ihk and ck 1 hk then w r i r ck is one to one and onto the arc j 1 k ihk k ihk lies except its endpoint in c and w c c j is conformal lemma 2 4 the nevanlinna function w admits the representation w z z i 1 z 2 1 2 d z 2 3 proof it follows from the above that w is a nevanlinna function and that the measure in its integral representation is supported on i that is we can write w z a z b i d z a 0 b r 6 moreover it satisfies the normalization conditions w 1 1 w 1 1 w 2 4 which yields b 1 a d 1 a 1 i d 1 2 2 5 from this we obtain 2 3 we are now ready to prove the easy part in theorem 1 3 that is if x 0 is in a gap on the boundary then the extremal polynomial is actually the remez polynomial lemma 2 5 let e b 0 1 g j 1 aj bj x 0 1 b 0 e 2 2 and tn x e be the extremal polynomial for x 0 as described in theorem 2 1 then rn x 0 tn x 0 e proof let be the comb associated to e and let us assume that n 0 n n noting that by theorem 2 1 there is no extension in the extremal gap we obtain that x 0 ir we will show that by decreasing the slits the set as well as the value of the extremal polynomial will increase let us decrease the slit corresponding to the gap aj bj by lemma 2 4 this is achieved by w z z z 2 1 2 1 d z thus a direct computation shows w al 1 w bl al 1 bl al 1 bl 1 1 2 1 al 1 bl d al 1 bl where we used that the support of d is included in the gap aj bj this also holds for l g with ag 1 1 thus the size of the bands bl al 1 increases and we get that e is increasing similarly we see that w x 0 x 0 recall that w z 1 z using that is decreasing on ir we get im x 0 im w x 0 im x 0 thus t x cos x satisfies t x 0 t x 0 therefore by this procedure we can show that there is b 0 with 1 b 0 e and tn x 0 b 0 1 tn x 0 e set 2 2 1 b 0 and note that since rn x 0 is clearly monotonic increasing in it follows that tn x 0 b 0 1 rn x 0 rn x 0 which concludes the proof 7 remark 2 6 continuing the heuristics provided in the beginning of this section we give an interpretation of this proof in terms of the harmonic measure the argument in the proof relies on showing that e e and w x 0 x 0 let us assume we were interested in the harmonic measure of e instead of its lebesgue measure then the above properties have a probabilistic interpretation namely the first one corresponds to the probability that a particle which starts at a point which is close to infinity in the domain and and terminates on the base of the comb from this perspective it is clear that this increases if one of the slit heights is decreased similarly writing the second one as w x 0 1 x 0 1 it corresponds to the probability that a particle terminates in 1 x 0 in and respectively again this explains why the value should be increased the above interpretation uses the fact that there is no additional portion of e outside of 1 1 for akhiezer polynomials this is not true this makes the problem essentially more delicate and we extend our tools by using the infinitesimal variation w as defined in 2 6 cf also remark 2 15 2 3 transformation of the akhiezer polynomials as is moving our goal is to describe the transformation of the comb as the interval starting from the center moves continuously to the left this should correspond to a continuous transformation of the comb which seems at the first sight impossible since the base of the slits are positioned only at integers we show in the following how the cases i ii iii iv can be connected by a continuous transformation let us start with case i in the degenerated configuration hn 1 then we start decreasing hn 1 until we reach hn 1 0 now we are in the situation that 1 n 1 and we continue with case ii that is 1 increases until it reaches 1 n all the time 1 n now we continue with case iii and increase 1 until the point 1 n 1 we continue with case iv and increase hn 1 from hn 1 0 to hn 1 we have arrived at our initial configuration but the base of the comb was shifted from position n n 1 to position n 1 n we believe it is helpful to understand these transformation also on the level of en our initial configuration corresponds to e en we view this as the additional interval is hidden at starting case i corresponds to the motion that the position of the addition interval decreases from until it joins e this corresponds to the change from case i to ii when it is fully absorbed we arrive at case iii i e e starts to be extended to the left until the extension separates and start to decrease to and the circle starts from the beginning theorem 2 7 moving a b to the left corresponds to a succession of continuous trans formations of the comb as described above if n is odd we start with case i and hn 1 if n is even we start with case iii and 1 n remark 2 8 when 0 by symmetry the extremal polynomial is even and all critical values are equally distributed on 1 and 1 the above procedure describes how 8 figure 1 comb domains for the cases i and ii all critical values are moved from the interval 1 to 1 as is decreasing in the limit when approaches 1 all critical values will be on 1 2 1 and the extremal polynomial will transform into the remez polynomial rn as we have already indicated at the end of section 2 2 the proof of theorem 2 7 requires in addition to the transition function w its infinitesimal transform w let us introduce the notation w z zw z w z w z and w z w z 0 2 6 lemma 2 9 under an appropriate choice of w z is differentiable with respect to and there exists k 0 such that w z lim 0 w z w z 0 1 z 2 1 c 2 k k ck z 2 7 where ck ck 0 1 k ihk proof we note that if k n 1 or k n 1 and we are in the situation of theorem 2 1 i or iv then due to 2 5 a 1 and a 1 otherwise in any case we obtain from the properties of w that a is strictly monotonic therefore if we fix 0 and define 0 i 0 d 0 1 2 then 7 i d 1 2 maps 0 0 continuously and bijectively on 0 0 through a reparametrization we can achieve that i d 1 2 0 0 thus the measures d 1 2 are normalized and we get by passing to a subsequence lim k w z k z k lim k i k 1 z 2 1 2 1 z d k k 1 z 2 1 2 d z since the support of k shrinks to ck we get that k ck for k 1 c 2 k 0 0 this concludes the proof 9 figure 2 comb domains for the cases iii and iv we are also interested in the case of growing slit heights this corresponds to u x w 1 x for some transition function as defined above note that since ck ck as 0 this inverse is well defined on r away from a vicinity of ck and we conclude since w z 0 1 that u x w x 2 8 the following lemma discusses the case i we show that decreasing hn 1 and simultaneously increasing h 0 appropriately allows us to move the gap to the left without changing its size let us set a b let c be the critical point in a b and c be the critical point outside 1 1 i e c 1 ih 0 c 1 n 1 ihn 1 lemma 2 10 let e with 0 be such that the corresponding extremal poly nomial an z corresponds to the case i then the infinitesimal variation w x generated by decreasing the height hn 1 under the constraint of a constant gap length const leads to an increase of h 0 moreover in this variation the gap is moving to the left that is is decreasing proof let wn 1 and w 0 be transforms corresponding to a variation of the slit heights hn 1 and h 0 in 2 7 we chose n 1 0 and determine the sign of 0 by the condition of constant gap length thus the total transform corresponds to w z wn 1 w 0 z and hence by the previous computations we find that w z 1 x 2 1 c 2 0 c x 1 x 2 1 c 2 c x 2 9 10 with 0 the value 0 is determined due to the constraint w b w a b a i e w b w a thus we obtain 0 1 b 2 c b 1 a 2 c a 0 1 c 2 1 b 2 c b 1 a 2 c a 1 c 2 b a 1 ab c a b c a c b 0 1 c 2 1 ab c a b c a c b 1 c 2 2 10 let x 1 ab a b x 2 11 since a b 2 0 is non decreasing moreover since a b 1 1 1 a 1 b 0 and hence c 0 and c 0 using that the numerator is negative for both summands we find that 0 implies 0 0 in other words the compression of the height hn 1 leads to a growth of h 0 since both summands are negative w a 1 a 2 1 c 2 0 c a 1 b 2 1 c 2 c a 0 consequently w b w a 0 and we find that the ends of the interval a b are moving to the left this concludes the proof case iv is similar to case i however we will encounter a certain specific phe nomena first of all we will increase the value of hn 1 to move the given gap to the left but in order to fulfill the constraint of fixed gap length both an increasing or a decreasing of h 0 is possible lemma 2 11 let e with 0 be such that the corresponding extremal polyno mial an z corresponds to the case iv let be defined as in 2 11 and 1 2 1 2 1 2 12 be its zero if c the infinitesimal variation w x generated by increasing the height hn 1 under the constraint of a constant gap length const leads to an increase of h 0 and it leads to a decrease of h 0 if c 1 in both case the gap is moving to the left that is is decreasing proof as before we find that the infinitesimal variation is of the form w x 1 x 2 1 c 2 0 c x 1 x 2 1 c 2 c x 0 respectively the constraint w b w a corresponds to c c a c b 0 1 c 2 c c a c b 1 c 2 0 11 we have that c 0 for c since c 1 a c b this implies that 0 0 as before we conclude that w a 0 and the interval is moving to the left if c 1 then c 0 and therefore 0 0 in this case w b 0 and again the interval is moving to the left finally if c we have c 0 and therefore 2 10 implies that 0 0 2 3 1 the cases ii and iii we will discuss case ii and case iii simultaneously recall that case ii corresponds to an extension of e to the right and case iii to an extension to the left i e 1 n 1 n or 1 n n 1 let but let us increase the normalization point 1 let w z 1 z be the corresponding transition functions lemma 2 12 let w be defined as above then there exists 0 such that w z 1 z 1 w z 1 z 1 1 1 2 13 and w z 1 z 0 2 14 proof we only prove the claim for w since 0 w is just an affine trans formation and using w 1 1 and w we find 2 13 since 1 1 we obtain that w 1 1 1 1 1 1 and thus 1 therefore w z lim w z z z 1 lim 1 0 lemma 2 13 let e with 0 be such that the corresponding extremal polyno mial an z corresponds to the case ii case iii then the infinitesimal variation w x generated by increasing 1 increasing 1 under the constraint of a constant gap length const leads to an increase decrease of h 0 moreover in this variation the gap is moving to the left that is is decreasing proof we only prove the case ii we have w x x 1 1 x 2 1 c 2 0 c x 0 2 15 applying the constraint w a w b we obtain 0 b a 1 ab a b c c a c b 0 1 c 2 since c 0 this implies 0 0 and thus h 0 is increasing moreover w a 0 which concludes the proof 12 we summarize our results in the following theorem theorem 2 14 let be defined by 2 12 then we have i h 0 is increasing ii h 0 is increasing iii h 0 is decreasing iv if c then h 0 is decreasing if c then h 0 is increasing in all cases is decreasing remark 2 15 we have seen in the proof of lemma 2 5 that w x 0 increased mono tonically if some other slit height was decreased theorem 2 14 in particular case iii and case iv show that such a monotonicity is lacking for akhiezer polynomials which makes the situation essentially different to the remez extremal problem 3 reduction to akhiezer polynomials the goal of this section is to finish the proof of theorem 1 3 that is if x 0 is in an internal gap then the extremal polynomial is an akhiezer polynomial recall that in contrast to section 2 2 now it is possible that there is an extension outside of 1 1 moreover this is a generic position all possible types of extremizer were described in corollary 2 2 and the discussion above the corollary thus it remains to show that on 1 1 the extremal configuration in fact only has one gap i e the extremal set is of the form e for some 1 1 first we will show that e has at most two gaps on 1 1 let tn z e denote the extremizer of 1 1 for the set e lemma 3 1 let e 1 1 and let x 0 be in an internal gap of e then there exists a two gap set e such that tn x 0 e tn x 0 e e e 3 1 proof we will only prove the case that there are no boundary gaps moreover let us assume that e is already maximal i e t 1 n 1 1 e 1 1 e let us write e 1 1 g j 1 aj bj and let us denote the gap which contains x 0 by a b let be the comb related to e and let us assume that the slit corresponding to a b is placed at 0 and let c denote the critical point of tn in a b assume that there are two additional gaps a 1 b 1 and 13 a 2 b 2 with slit heights hk and critical points ck k 1 2 we will vary the slit heights hk and h such that w x 0 x 0 and e e therefore we get w z z 2 1 c 21 1 1 c 1 z z 2 1 c 22 1 2 c 1 z z 2 1 c 2 1 c z 3 2 the constraints g j 1 w bj w aj 0 w x 0 0 3 3 will guarantee that 3 1 is satisfied our goal is to find 1 0 and 2 such that 3 3 is satisfied let us define h z z 2 1 z x 0 z c 1 z c 2 z c due to the second constraint in 3 3 we have w z f z h z 3 4 where f z is linear thus f z k z or f z k we need to check that we can always find such that the first constraint in 3 3 is satisfied if g j 1 h bj h aj 0 we set f z k if g j 1 h bj h aj 6 0 we define g j 1 bjh bj ajh aj g j 1 h bj h aj in any case we define w by 3 4 and 1 2 as the residues of this function at c 1 c 2 c respectively now we have to distinguish two cases if 6 c 1 we can choose k so that 1 0 and decrease h 1 if at some point c 1 we can choose k so that 2 will be decreased note that in this case h 1 remains unchanged in particular it won t increase again hence this procedure allows us to erase all but one additional gap the case of boundary gaps works essentially in the same way only using instead of the variations used above variations as described in lemma 2 12 ending proof of theorem 1 3 first assume that the extremizer is in a generic position that is there is an extra interval in r 1 1 we have tn z e with e 1 1 a b a 1 b 1 3 5 and tn z e 1 for z e in the corresponding comb has three slits which heights we denote by hout h h 1 our goal is to show that we can reduce the value h 1 varying all three values we get that the corresponding infinitesimal variation as described by expression 3 2 with the parameters out 1 therefore we still can satisfy the two constraints in 3 3 and choose one of the parameters positive since the direction of 14 the variation of the heights hout and h is not essential for us we choose 1 0 and therefore reduce the size of h 1 in a degenerated case we can use variations which were described in section 2 3 assume that e is of the form 3 5 but the corresponding comb has only two non trivial teeth of the heights h and h 1 wlog we assume that b a 1 we have tn z e cos z n 1 n 1 we will apply the third variation see figure 2 left that is we will reduce the value h 1 and move the preimage of 1 in the positive direction according to 2 14 see also 2 15 we obtain w z z 1 1 z 2 1 c 21 1 c 1 z 0 1 0 let us point out that with an arbitrary choice of the parameter 1 0 and 0 we get an increasing function therefore w 1 w b 1 0 w a 1 w b 0 w a w 1 0 thus with a small variation of this kind we get e w 1 w 1 w a w b w a 1 w b 1 with e w 1 w b 1 w a 1 w b w a w 1 1 b 1 a 1 b a 1 e on the other hand w z has a trivial zero z 1 and a second one which we denote by y since 1 y 1 c 21 1 c 1 y 0 we get y y 1 2 1 1 2 c 1 where 2 1 1 c 21 1 1 2 1 2 0 thus with different values of 0 and 1 0 we can get an arbitrary value y 1 c 1 assume that x 0 c we choose 1 2 such that y c recall our assumption b a 1 therefore this is possible then w x 0 0 for a small we get w x 0 x 0 by definition tn w x 0 e tn x 0 e since in this range tn w x 0 e is increasing we get tn x 0 e tn x 0 e that is tn z e was not an extremal polynomial for the andievskii problem if x 0 c b we choose y c then w x 0 0 we repeat the same arguments having in mind that in this range tn z e is decreasing thus we arrive to the same contradiction tn x 0 e tn x 0 e 15 4 asymptotics the goal of this section is to prove theorem 1 5 and to give a description of the upper envelope 1 6 4 1 totik widom bounds we need an asymptotic result for akhiezer polynomials recall that e 1 1 and let an denote the associated akhiezer polynomial moreover we denote e n a 1 n 1 1 e in and n c e n we have described the shape of the additional interval in in theorem 2 1 and the discussion below the following lemma is known in a much more general context 8 proposition 4 4 lemma 4 1 let be fixed and an be the associated akhiezer polynomial let xn in denote the single zero of an outside of 1 1 for any y log 2 an y ng y n o 1 4 1 if we pass to a subsequence such that lim k xnk x r 1 1 then lim k nk g y g y nk g y x 4 2 where c e proof of theorem 1 5 we start with the case that the sup in 1 6 is attained at some internal point 0 1 0 let tn x 0 be the extremizer of 1 2 and set e n t 1 n x 0 1 1 and n c e n due to theorem 1 3 e n is either 1 2 1 or e n e n in for some n and some additional interval outside of 1 1 in the following we will denote g x g x and we note that by definition g x g x put en e n 1 1 and n c en due to extremality of 0 we have g x 0 0 g x 0 n since n n we get g x 0 n g x 0 n using 4 1 or 1 4 and the extremality property of tn x 0 x 0 we get ng x 0 n log 2 tn x 0 x 0 o 1 log 2 tn x 0 e 0 o 1 equation 4 2 yields log 2 tn x 0 e 0 ng x 0 0 c o 1 16 where c sup x r g x x 0 0 4 3 by definition tn x 0 x 0 ln x 0 and therefore combining all inequalities finishes the proof of 1 8 the proof for the boundary case is essentially the same only in the last step due to representation 1 4 there is no extra constant c due to the fact that there is no extension of the domain and we get 1 7 4 2 the asymptotic diagram in this section we introduce an asymptotic diagram which provides a description of the upper envelope x first of all we prove lemma 1 4 proof of lemma 1 4 recall the explicit representation of green functions for two in tervals as elliptic integrals for a b we have g x x a c d 2 1 a b 4 4 where c c b a d 2 1 a b b a d 2 1 a b 4 5 if for fixed x 0 the sup is attained at an interval point then clearly g x 0 4 6 holds thus it remains to show that 4 6 has a unique solution x 0 due to 4 4 we have log xg x c c x 1 2 a a x 1 2 b b x since a b 1 we get x g x c c x x x a x b 1 x 2 1 x a x b 4 7 note that inf x a b c x x x a x b 1 since the distance c b monotonically increases with we have c 1 therefore we get x g x 0 in 4 7 that is g x is increasing for x a b moreover limx a g x and limx b g x and we obtain that a zero x 0 of the function g x in a b exists and is unique 17 thus the limiting behavior of ln x 0 n can be distinguished by a diagram with two curves which we describe in the following proposition see also example 4 5 proposition 4 2 in the range x 1 0 x represents the upper envelope of the following two curves the first one is given explicitly y g x log x 1 x 1 2 1 4 8 and the second one is given in parametric form x x 0 y g x 0 1 0 4 9 moreover the end points of the last curve are given explicitly by 0 1 2 log 1 1 for 0 1 2 0 for 1 4 10 proof according to lemma 1 4 if x is assumed at the end point 1 then it is the green function in the complement to the interval 1 2 1 which has a well known representation 4 8 alternatively x x 0 and x g x 0 for a certain in the range what is 4 9 further for 0 g 0 x is the green function related to two symmetric intervals due to the symmetry x 0 0 0 and g 0 x can be reduced to the green function of a single interval 2 1 we get g 0 0 1 2 log 1 1 thus it remains to prove the last statement of the proposition our proof is based on expressing g in terms of elliptic integrals and manipulating those it will be convenient to make a standard substitution in 4 4 let cos then g x x c 1 2 d x arccos x 4 11 differentiating 4 11 we get g x i 1 x i 2 x c i 3 x 4 12 where i 1 x x 1 c 1 2 1 2 d i 2 x x c 1 x 2 2 x 2 i 3 x x d 1 2 18 let be such that 0 as 1 to be chosen later on and let x cos 4 13 direct estimations show that i 1 x o 1 i 2 x a 1 o 1 where lim 1 a 1 0 the integral i 3 x also tends to zero but we will need a more precise decomposition i 3 x b 1 b 2 3 3 o 5 4 14 with lim 1 b 1 0 indeed we have i 3 x a d 1 2 0 d 1 cos 2 therefore for sufficiently small we can use the expansion 1 1 cos 2 b 1 b 2 2 o 4 where o 4 is uniform in we get 4 14 in the same time lim 1 b 1 1 1 1 2 2 0 collecting all three terms we obtain g x a 1 c b 1 b 2 3 3 o 1 1 c 2 3 3 o 1 4 15 where 1 a 1 b 1 a 1 b 1 and 2 is chosen appropriately recall that 1 and have positive and finite limits as 1 similar manipulations with elliptic integrals show that c as 1 in fact the rate of this divergence is see appendix c log 2 1 1 1 2 2 0 but such accuracy is not needed for our purpose having these estimations we can find a suitable interval x x with the limit lim 1 x 1 2 4 16 19 such that g x changes its sign in it and therefore this interval contains the unique solution of the equation g x 0 define c 1 since c 3 o 1 4 15 gets the form 1 1 g x c 1 c c 1 o 1 2 c 1 c 1 o 1 4 17 where x is defined by 4 13 for for c sufficiently large we ob tain in 4 17 both positive and negative values and simultaneously we have 4 16 consequently x 0 1 2 corollary 4 3 let be a unique solution of the equation 2 1 1 0 1 numerically 0 543689 then for x does not coincide identically with g x in its range x 1 0 on the other hand for an arbitrary 0 there exists x 1 such that x and g x coincide in 1 x proof the first claim follows by a direct comparison of g 0 and g 0 0 see 4 8 and 4 10 for a fixed we define x inf 1 0 x 0 4 18 by 4 10 and continuity x 1 thus the curve 4 9 does not intersect the range 1 x remark 4 4 we do not claim here that 1 x with x given by 4 18 is the biggest possible interval on which x g x see example 4 5 bellow for details example 4 5 a numerical example of the asymptotic diagram for 0 4 is given in figure 3 diagrams for other values of 0 5 look pretty the same let xs be the switching point between two remez and akhiezer extremal configurations i e xs g xs g s x 0 s x 0 s xs recall that x was defined in 4 18 on the diagram we can observe the following four regions 1 x x xs xs 1 2 and 1 2 0 note that we discuss the case 1 2 0 i e 0 5 20 1 0 0 8 0 6 0 4 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 5 1 0 1 5 figure 3 the asymptotic diagram for 0 4 a x 1 2 0 in this case x implies that such an interval is a subset of 1 1 even in the leftmost position x therefore the function g x for a fixed x and x x attains its maximum at some internal point and we get the case g x 0 b x xs 1 2 as soon as x 1 2 the left boundary for a possible value of is given by 1 respectively the supremum of g x for a fixed x can be attained either at an internal point 1 x or as the limit at the left end point in this range it is still attained at an internal point note that besides the local maximum the function gets a local minimum the second branch of the curve 4 9 with the same coordinate x 0 x c x x xs for such x the function g x has still its local maximum and minimum but the biggest value is attained at the boundary point 1 i e x g x d x 1 x at x x the points of local maximum and minimum of the function g x collide that is in fact they produce an inflection point the function g x become monotonic in this region its supremum is the limit at the boundary point 1 see the second claim in corollary 4 3 21 a lemma on the limit of c lemma a 1 set 1 1 1 2 2 then c tends to as 0 with the rate c log 2 proof by 4 5 we have c b a d 2 2 1 2 b a d 2 2 1 2 making the change of variables cos 0 we get c 0 2 cos sin d sin 1 x 2 0 sin d sin 1 x 2 0 cos d 1 x 2 0 d 1 x 2 thus introducing u 0 cos d 1 2 v 0 d 1 2 we have 1 c v 2 det u v u v since 1 we have u 0 cos d 1 2 1 2 v 0 d 1 2 1 2 using the definition of we get det u v u v det u v u v 0 1 1 det 0 1 d 1 2 1 2 0 d 1 2 1 2 0 1 d 1 2 0 d 1 2 finally c 1 1 v 2 det 0 d 1 1 2 0 d 1 2 1 2 0 1 1 d 0 d 1 2 1 1 v 2 det i 1 i 2 i 3 v a 1 22 now we insert 1 1 1 2 2 0 for a sufficiently small 0 we have 1 1 cos 2 2 2 o 4 0 0 recall that b therefore the following limit lim 0 0 d 1 2 exists thus we have v 0 d 1 2 0 0 d 1 0 0 d 2 2 0 0 dt 1 t 2 log also i 1 0 d 1 1 2 0 0 d 1 log moreover for i 3 we get lim 0 0 1 1 d 0 1 cos 2 cos d 0 as before we can split up i 2 and get i 2 0 0 d 1 2 1 2 0 0 d 2 2 3 2 1 2 0 0 dt 1 t 2 3
