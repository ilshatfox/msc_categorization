used to establish universality at the edge of the spectrum for a fixed positive mea sure on 1 1 assume that is a regular measure and is absolutely continuous in some closed neighborhood j of 1 assume that in j x h x 1 x 1 x where h 1 0 and h is continuous at 1 then uni versality at 1 for follows from universality at 1 for the classical jacobi weight 1 x 1 x dedicated to the 60 th birthday of percy deift 1 results 1 let be a finite positive borel measure on 1 1 then we may define or thonormal polynomials pn x nx n n 0 n 0 1 2 satisfying the orthonormality conditions 1 1 pnpmd mn these orthonormal polynomials satisfy a recurrence relation of the form xpn x an 1 pn 1 x bnpn x anpn 1 x where an n 1 n 0 and bn r n 1 and we use the convention p 1 0 throughout w d dx denotes the absolutely continuous part of a classic result of e a rakhmanov 6 asserts that if w 0 a e in 1 1 then belongs to the nevai blumenthal class m that is lim n an 1 2 and lim n bn 0 a class of measures

normalized cousin k n x y w x 1 2 w y 1 2 kn x y in 3 we presented a new approach to this universality limit proving theorem 1 1 let be a finite positive borel measure on 1 1 that is regular let i be a closed subinterval of 1 1 in which is absolutely continuous a assume that w is positive and continuous in i let denote the modulus of continuity of w in i so that for 0 w sup w x w y x y i and x y assume that w satisfies the dini condition 1 0 w t t dt then if i is a compact subinterval of i 0 we have lim n k n x a ekn x x x b ekn x x k n x x sin a b a b uniformly for x i and a b in compact subsets of the real line b assume that w is bounded above and below by positive constants and moreover w is riemann integrable in i then if p 0 and i is a closed subinterval of i 0 lim n i k n x a ekn x x x b ekn x x k n x x sin a b a b p dx 0 uniformly for a b in compact subsets of the real line we also established l 1 analogues assuming less on w however we have subse quently realized that the smoothness condition in a can be dropped and all we need is that w is continuous on i the technique of 3 involved a taylor series expansion in of kn x n x n a localization technique and a smoothing technique in this paper we show how localization and smoothing can be applied at the edge 1 of the spectrum as far as the author is aware the most general result to date for jacobi type weights is due to kuijlaars and vanlessen 2 let be absolutely continuous and w have the form 1 1 w x h x w a x h x 1 x 1 x where h is positive and analytic in 1 1 they showed that uniformly for a b in bounded subsets of 0 as n 1 2 1 2 n 2 k n 1 a 2 n 2 1 b 2 n 2 j a b o a 2 b 2 n here j u v j u vj v j v uj u 2 u v is the bessel kernel of order and j is the usual bessel function of the first kind and order our result is universality limits 3 theorem 1 2 let be a finite positive borel measure on 1 1 that is regular assume that for some 0 is absolutely continuous in j 1 1 and in j its absolutely continuous component has the form w hw where 1 assume that h 1 0 and h is continuous at 1 then uniformly for a b in compact subsets of 0 we have 1 3 lim n 1 2 n 2 k n 1 a 2 n 2 1 b 2 n 2 j a b if 0 we may allow compact subsets of 0 remarks a we remind the reader that is regular if w is positive a e in 1 1 or more generally if m b our proof uses the fact that universality holds for the jacobi weight w c we can reformulate this in a way that allows a b to vary in a compact subset of the complex plane to do this one shows that n 2 2 kn 1 a 2 n 2 1 b 2 n 2 is uniformly bounded for n 1 and a b in compact subsets of the plane this can be proved by bounding 1 x 1 n 2 1 2 kn x x in 1 1 for some 0 using cauchy schwarz to bound kn x y and then using the maximum principle for subharmonic functions this paper is organised as follows in the next section we establish asymptotics for christoffel functions in section 3 we localize and in section 4 we smoothe and prove the theorem in the sequel c c 1 c 2 denote constants independent of n x the same symbol does not necessarily denote the same constant in different occurences we shall write c c or c 6 c to respectively denote depen dence on or independence of the parameter given measures we use k n k n and p n p n to denote their reproducing kernels and orthonormal polyno mials similarly superscripts are used to distinguish their leading coefficients and christoffel functions and the superscript denotes quantities associated with the jacobi weight w acknowledgement this research was stimulated by the wonderful conference in honor of percy deift s 60 th birthday held at courant institute in june 2006 2 christoffel functions recall that the nth christoffel function for is n x 1 kn x x min deg p n 1 1 1 p 2 d p 2 x the methods used to prove the following result are well known but i could not find this theorem in the literature theorem 2 1 let be a regular measure on 1 1 assume that for some 0 is absolutely 4 d s lubinsky

uniformly for n n 0 a and a 0 a 2 2 n 1 a 2 n 2 n 1 a 2 n 2 n 2 2 the constants implicit in do not depend on remark the notation means that the ratio of the two christoffel functions is bounded above and below by positive constants independent of n and a our proof actually shows that if n is any sequence of positive numbers with limit 0 n x n x h 1 o 1 uniformly for x 1 n 1 proof let 0 and choose 0 such that 2 3 1 1 h x h 1 1 x 1 1 let us define a measure with in 1 1 and in i 1 1 let be absolutely continuous with absolutely continuous component w satisfying 2 4 w w h 1 1 in i because of 2 3 d d so that if n is the nth christoffel function for we have for all x 2 5 n x n x we now find an upper bound for n x for x 1 2 1 there exists r 0 1 such that 2 6 0 1 t x 2 2 1 r for x 1 2 1 and t 1 1 choose 0 1 2 and 1 so close to 1 that 2 7 1 1 r 4 let m m n n 2 n 2 fix x 1 2 1 and choose a polynomial pm of degree m 1 such that m x 1 1 p 2 mw and p 2 m x 1 universality limits 5 thus pm is the minimizing polynomial in the christoffel function for the jacobi weight w at x let sn t pm t 1 t x 2 2 n 2 a polynomial of degree m 1 2 n 2 n 1 with sn x 1 then using 2 4 and 2 6 n x 1 1 s 2 nd h 1 1 1 1 p 2 mw pm 2 l 1 1 1 r n 2 1 1 d h 1 1 m x pm 2 l 1 1 1 r n 2 1 1 d now we use the key idea from 4 lemma 9 p 450 for m m 0 we have pm 2 l 1 1 m 1 1 p 2 mw m m x this holds more generally for any polynomial p of degree m 1 and is a consequence of the regularity of the measure w alternatively we could use classic bounds for the christoffel functions for jacobi weight then from 2 7 uniformly for x 1 2 1 n x h 1 1 m x 1 c 1 1 r 2 n h 1 1 m x 1 o 1 so as n n sup x 1 2 1 n x n x h 1 1 1 o 1 sup x 1 2 1 m x n x 2 8 now for large enough n and some c independent of m n 2 9 sup x 1 2 1 m x n x 1 c indeed if p k denote the orthonormal jacobi polynomials for w they admit the bound 5 p 170 p k x c 1 x 1 k 2 2 1 4 x 0 1 6 d s lubinsky then 0 1 n x m x n x n 1 k m p 2 k x c n x n m max n 2 k n 1 x 1 k 2 1 2 c n n x 1 x 1 n 2 1 2 c by classical bounds for christoffel functions 5 p 108 lemma 5 so we have 2 9 now let a 0 a we see that for n n 0 a we have 1 a 2 n 2 1 2 1 and hence 2 8 gives lim sup n sup a 0 a n 1 a 2 n 2 n 1 a 2 n 2 h 1 1 1 c as the left hand side is independent of the parameters we deduce that 2 10 lim sup n sup a 0 a n 1 a 2 n 2 n 1 a 2 n 2 h 1 in a similar way we can establish the converse bound 2 11 lim sup n sup a 0 a n 1 a 2 n 2 n 1 a 2 n 2 h 1 1 indeed with m x and as above let us choose a polynomial p of degree m 1 such that m x 1 1 p 2 m t d t and p 2 m x 1 then with sn as above and proceeding as above n x 1 1 s 2 nw h 1 1 1 1 1 p 2 md pm 2 l 1 1 1 r n 2 1 1 w h 1 1 1 m x 1 c 1 1 r 2 n and so as above sup x 1 2 1 m x m x h 1 1 1 1 o 1 sup x 1 2 1 m x n x h 1 1 1 1 o 1 1 c then 2 11 follows after a scale change m n and using monotonicity of n in n together 2 10 and 2 11 give the result universality limits 7 3 localization theorem 3 1 assume that are regular measures on 1 1 assume that d d hw t dt in j 1 1 where h satisfies the hypothesis of theorem 2 1 let a 0 then as n 3 1 sup a b 0 a kn k n 1 a 2 n 2 1 b 2 n 2 n 2 2 o 1 proof we initially assume that 3 2 d d in 1 1 the idea is to estimate the l 2 norm of kn x t k n x t over 1 1 and then to use christoffel function estimates now 1 1 kn x t k n x t 2 d t 1 1 k 2 n x t d t 2 1 1 kn x t k n x t d t 1 1 k 2 n x t d t kn x x 2 k n x x 1 1 k 2 n x t d t by the reproducing kernel property as d d we also have 1 1 k 2 n x t d t 1 1 k 2 n x t d t k n x x so 1 1 kn x t k n x t 2 d t kn x x k n x x 3 3 next for any polynomial p of degree n 1 we have the christoffel function estimate 3 4 p y kn y y 1 2 1 1 p 2 d 1 2 applying this to p t kn x t k n x t and using 3 3 gives kn x y k n x y kn y y 1 2 kn x x k n x x 1 2 so kn x y k n x y kn x x kn y y kn x x 1 2 1 k n x x kn x x 1 2 8 d s lubinsky now we set x 1 a 2 n 2 and y 1 b 2 n 2 where a b 0 a by theorem 2 1 uniformly for such x k n x x kn x x 1 o 1 for they both have the same asymptotics as for the jacobi weight moreover uniformly for a b 0 a kn 1 b 2 n 2 1 b 2 n 2 kn 1 a 2 n 2 1 a 2 n 2 n 2 2 so sup a b 0 a kn k n 1 a 2 n 2 1 b 2 n 2 n 2 2 o 1 now we drop the extra hypothesis 3 2 define a measure by in j and d x max 1 w w dx d s d s in 1 1 j where w w and s s are respectively the absolutely continuous and singular components of then d d and d d and is regular as its absolutely continuous component is positive in 1 1 and hence lies in the even smaller class m the case above shows that the reproducing kernels for and have the same asymptotics as that for in the sense of 3 1 and hence the same asymptotics as each other 4 smoothing in this section we approximate of theorem 1 2 by a jacobi measure and then prove theorem 1 2 our smoothing result is theorem 4 1 let be as in theorem 1 2 let 0 1 2 and choose 0 such that 2 3 holds let 4 1 w h 1 w in 1 1 let a 0 then there exists c and n 0 such that for n n 0 4 2 sup a b 0 a kn k n 1 a 2 n 2 1 b 2 n 2 n 2 2 c 1 2 where c is independent of n proof we note that because of our localization result theorem 3 1 we may replace w by w where w w w h in i 1 1 and w w h 1 in 1 1 i without affecting the asymptotics forkn 1 a 2 n 2 1 b 2 n 2 note that and play no role in theorem 3 1 so in the sequel we assume that w w h 1 w in 1 1 i while keeping w the same in i observe that 2 3 implies that 4 3 1 1 w w 1 in 1 1 universality limits 9 then much as in the previous section 1 1 kn x t k n x t 2 w t dt 1 1 k 2 n x t w t dt 2 1 1 kn x t k n x t w t dt 1 1 k 2 n x t w t dt 1 1 k 2 n x t w t dt i k 2 n x t w w t dt 2 kn x x k n x x k n x x kn x x i k 2 n x t w w t dt recall that w w in 1 1 i by 4 3 i k 2 n x t w w t dt j k 2 n x t w t dt kn x x so 4 4 1 1 kn x t k n x t 2 w t dt k n x x 1 kn x x applying an obvious analogue of 3 4 to p t kn x t k n x t and using 4 4 gives for y 1 1 kn x y k n x y k n y y 1 2 k n x x 1 kn x x 1 2 so kn x y k n x y k n x x k n y y k n x x 1 2 1 1 kn x x k n x x 1 2 in view of 4 3 we also have kn x x k n x x n x n x 1 1 so for all y 1 1 kn x y k n x y k n x x k n y y k n x x 1 2 1 1 1 1 2 2 k n y y k n x x 1 2 now we set x 1 a 2 n 2 and y 1 b 2 n 2 where a b 0 a by theorem 2 1 uniformly for a b 0 a k n 1 b 2 n 2 1 b 2 n 2 k n 1 a 2 n 2 1 a 2 n 2 n 2 2 10 d s lubinsky and also the constants implicit in are independent of this is crucial thus for some c and n 0 depending only on a we have for n n 0 sup a b 0 a kn k n 1 a 2 n 2 1 b 2 n 2 n 2 2 c proof of theorem 1 2 let 1 0 we can choose 0 so small that the right hand side of 4 2 is less than 1 recall that c there is independent of hence for n n 0 a 1 sup a b 0 a kn k n 1 a 2 n 2 1 b 2 n 2 n 2 2 1 it follows that lim n sup a b 0 a kn k n 1 a 2 n 2 1 b 2 n 2 n 2 2 0 next uniformly for a a 1 a 2 where 0 a 1 a 2 we see that w 1 a 2 n 2 1 o 1 h 1 2 a 2 n 2 w 1 a 2 n 2 1 o 1 with a similar relation when we replace a by b hence uniformly for a b a 1 a 2 1 2 n 2 k n 1 a 2 n 2 1 b 2 n 2 1 2 n 2 k n 1 a 2 n 2 1 b 2 n 2 1 o 1 o 1 j a b o 1 by the universality limit 1 2 for the scaled jacobi weight w h 1 w for this see for example 2 when 0 we can allow instead a 0 a references 1 p deift
