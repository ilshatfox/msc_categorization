approximation problem posed in 1924 deals with approximation by polynomials in the weighted uniform norm f fw l r the qualitative form of this problem was solved by achieser mergelyan and pollard in the 1950 s quantitative forms of the problem were actively investigated starting from the 1960 s we survey old and recent aspects of this topic including the bernstein problem weighted jackson and bernstein theorems markov bernstein and nikolskii inequalities orthogonal expansions and lagrange interpolation we present the main ideas used in many of the proofs and different techniques of proof though not the full proofs the class of weights we consider is typically even and supported on the whole real line so we exclude laguerre type weights on 0 nor do we discuss saff s weighted

approximation problem the first quarter of the twentieth century was a great period for approximation theory in that time dunham jackson and sergei bernstein completed their great works on the degree of approximation mu ntz proved his theorem on approximation by powers x j j 0 solving a problem of bernstein faber introduced faber polynomials and faber series and szego was developing the theory of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle right at the end of that quarter in 1924 bernstein 4 came up with a problem that became known as bernstein s approximation problem and whose ramifications continue to be explored to this day weighted approximation 3 one can speculate that one day bernstein must have felt confined in approximating on bounded intervals and so asked by weierstrass we know that we can uniformly approximate any continuous function on a compact interval by polynomials are there analogues on the whole real line the first thing to deal with is the unboundedness of polynomials on unbounded intervals clearly we need to damp the growth of a polynomial at infinity by multiplying by a weight for example consider p x exp x 2 x r where p is a polynomial or more generally p x w x here w must decay sufficiently fast at to counteract the growth of every polynomial that is lim x xnw x 0 n 0 1 2 1 1 what can be approximated and in what sense this problem is known as bernstein s ap proximation problem a more precise statement is as follows let w r 0 1 be measurable when is it true that for every continuous f r r with lim x fw x 0 there exists a sequence of polynomials pn n 1 with lim n f pn w l r 0 if true we then say that the polynomials are dense or that bernstein s problem has a positive solution the restriction that fw has limit 0 at is essential if xkw x is bounded on the real line for every non negative k then xkw x has limit 0 at for every such k and so the same is true of every weighted polynomial pw so we could not hope to approximate in the uniform norm any function f for which fw does not have limit 0 at when w vanishes on a set of positive measure or is not continuous extra complications ensue so in the sequel we shall assume that w is both positive and continuous the more general case is surveyed at length in 67 the case where we approximate only on a countable set of points is included in that study in his early works on the problem bernstein often assumed that 1 w is the restriction to the real line of an even entire function with positive even order maclaurin series coefficients other major contributors were n i akhiezer k i babenko l de branges l carleson m m dzrbasjan t hall s izumi t kawata s n mergelyan and v s videnskii yes that s lennart carleson and the same mergelyan of mergelyan theorem fame on uniform approximation by polynomials on compact subsets of the plane bernstein s approximation problem was solved independently by achieser mergelyan and pol lard in the 1950 s mergelyan 67 p 147 introduced a regularization of the weight z sup p z p a polynomial and sup t r p t w t 1 t 2 1 d s lubinsky 4 theorem 1 1 mergelyan let w r 0 1 be continuous and satisfy 1 1 there is a positive answer to bernstein s problem iff log t 1 t 2 dt in another formulation there is a positive answer iff z for at least one non real z and then z for all non real z we shall outline the proof of this in the next section akhiezer and perhaps bernstein 67 p 158 used instead the regularization w z sup p z p a polynomial with pw l r 1 theorem 1 2 akhiezer let w r 0 1 be continuous and satisfy 1 1 there is a positive answer to bernstein s problem iff logw t 1 t 2 dt finally pollard 161 67 p 164 showed theorem 1 3 pollard let w r 0 1 be continuous and satisfy 1 1 there is a positive answer to bernstein s problem iff both log 1 w t 1 t 2 dt and there exists a sequence of polynomials pn such that for each x lim n pn x w x 1 while sup n 1 pnw l r pollard later 162 reformulated this as sup log p x 1 x 2 dx p a polynomial with pw l r 1 of course these are not very transparent criteria when the weight is in some sense regular simplifications are possible theorem 1 4 let w be even and log 1 w ex be convex there is a positive answer to bern stein s problem iff 0 log 1 w x 1 x 2 dx 1 2 weighted approximation 5 this result was proved by lennart carleson in 1951 10 although misha sodin pointed out to the author that it appeared in a 1937 paper of izumi and kawata 51 on perusing the latter paper i agree that it is clearly implicit in the results there though not explicitly stated i have also seen the result attributed to m dzrbasjan the reader should conclude that the history presented in this survey is by no means authoritative but merely what could be deduced often from secondary sources in the available time corollary 1 5 let 0 and w x exp x 1 3 there is a positive answer to bernstein s problem iff 1 as regards necessary conditions hall showed that 1 2 is necessary for density when density fails only a limited class of entire functions can be approximated 70 a comprehensive treatment of this topic is given in koosis book 67 a concise elegant exposition appears in 86 p 28 ff a more abstract solution to bernstein s problem was given by louis de branges of bieberbach fame in 1959 29 the ideas in that paper have had several recent ramifications 174 175 what about extensions to lp at least when w is continuous the answer is the same theorem 1 6 let w r 0 1 be continuous and satisfy 1 1 let p 1 then any of the conditions of achieser mergelyan or pollard is necessary and sufficient so that for every measurable f r r with fw lp r there exist polynomials pn with lim n f pn w lp r 0 there is even a generalization of this theorem to weighted mu ntz polynomials 188 as regards the proof of the lp case let us quote koosis 67 p 211 in general in the kind of approximation problem considered here that of the density of a certain simple class of functions in the whole space it makes very little difference which lp norm is chosen if the proofs vary in difficulty they are hardest for the l 1 norm or the uniform norm indeed in his 1955 paper 162 pollard added about two pages to deal with the lp case in the special case of l 2 there are connections to the classical moment problem let sk be a sequence of real numbers if there is a positive measure on the real line such that sk tkd t k 0 1 2 1 4 then we say that the hamburger moment problem for sk has a solution if there is only one solution of the equations 1 4 we say the moment problem is determinate existence of is equivalent to positivity of certain determinants the determinacy of the moment problem is often a deeper and more difficult issue if we define z sup p z 2 p a polynomial with p 2 d 1 then a necessary and sufficient condition for determinacy is 67 p 141 log t 1 t 2 dt d s lubinsky 6 here log x max 0 log x in particular for the measure d t exp t dt one can use this to show that the corresponding moment problem is determinate iff 1 recall that bernstein s approximation problem also had a positive solution iff 1 there are still closer connections to bernstein s problem 38 thm 4 3 p 77 it is noteworthy that this was obtained by m riesz in 1923 even before bernstein s problem was formulated theorem 1 7 suppose that is a positive measure on the real line with finite moments sk as in 1 4 suppose moreover that has no point masses so that x 7 x d is a continuous function of x then the moment problem associated with sk is determinate iff for every measurable function f with f 2 d finite and for every 0 there exists a polynomial p such that f p 2 d without assuming the continuity of d determinacy still implies density of the polynomials 38 p 74 ff there is also an important result on one sided approximation 38 theorem 3 3 p 73 theorem 1 8 suppose that is a positive measure on the real line with finite moments sk as in 1 4 suppose moreover that the moment problem associated with sk is determinate let 0 and f r r be a function that is riemann stieltjes integrable against d over every finite interval and improperly riemann integrable over the whole real line and of polynomial growth at then there exist polynomials r and s such that r f s in r and s r d some recent work related to bernstein s approximation problem and its l 2 analogue appear in 6 7 8 79 155 157 163 164 165 173 174 175 188 2 some ideas for the resolution of bernstein s problem in this section we present some of the ideas used by akhiezer mergelyan pollard to resolve bern stein s approximation problem it s relatively easy to derive the necessary parts of the conditions we follow 67 p 147 ff and 86 p 28 ff recall mergelyan s regularization of w z sup p z p a polynomial and sup t r p t w t 1 t 2 1 in the sequel c c 1 c 2 denote positive constants independent of n x t and polynomials p of degree n the same symbol does not necessarily denote the same constant in different occur rences we write c c or c 6 c to respectively show that c depends on or does not weighted approximation 7 depend on we use the notation in the following sense given sequences of real numbers cn and dn we write cn dn if for some positive constants c 1 c 2 independent of n we have c 1 cn dn c 2 lemma 2 1 in order that bernstein s approximation problem has a positive solution it is neces sary that for all z c r z 2 1 proof suppose that bernstein s problem has a positive solution fix z c r since the function f t t z 1 is continuous and fw has limit 0 at we can find polynomials rn such that n f rn w l r 0 2 2 as n let pn t 1 t z rn t n t z n f rn t then for all t r pn t t z w t 1 n f rn t w t 1 next for some constant c independent of t we have t z t i c t r then sup t r pn t w t 1 t 2 sup t r t z t i pn t t z w t c it follows that pn c is one of the polynomials considered in forming the sup in z so z pn z c 1 nc n let s think how we can reverse this to show the condition is also sufficient if z then reversing the above argument we see that there are polynomials rn satisfying 2 2 with f t t z 1 if z for all z we can approximate linear combinations f t m j 1 cj t zj by polynomials in the norm w l r for small we can then approximate 1 2 1 t z 1 t z 1 t z 2 2 d s lubinsky 8 and hence also 1 t z 2 iterating this we can approximate 1 t z m for any non real z and m 1 we can then approximate polynomials in 1 t z the latter can in turn uniformly approximate on the real line any continuous function f t that has limit 0 at use weierstrass theorem and make a transformation x 1 t c since w 1 we then obtain a positive solution to bernstein s problem for continuous functions that have limit 0 at this class of continuous functions is big enough to approximate arbitrary ones for the bernstein problem for full details see 67 p 148 ff next we show lemma 2 2 in order that bernstein s approximation problem has a positive solution it is neces sary that log 1 w t 1 t 2 dt 2 3 proof the basic tool is the inequality log p i 1 log p t 1 t 2 dt 2 4 valid for all polynomials p to prove this suppose first that p has no zeros in the closed upper half plane we can then choose an analytic branch of logp there and the residue theorem gives logp i 1 logp t 1 t 2 dt taking real parts we obtain 2 4 with equality instead of inequality when p has no zeros in the upper half plane but possibly has zeros on the real axis a continuity argument shows that 2 4 persists but with equality finally when p z contains factors z a with a in the upper half plane we use log a i log a i 1 log a t 1 t 2 dt 1 log a t 1 t 2 dt and divide such factors out from p so we have 2 4 now if sup t r p t w t 1 t 2 1 2 5 we obtain 1 log p t 1 t 2 dt 1 log 1 w t 1 t 2 dt 1 2 log 1 t 2 1 t 2 dt and hence log p i 1 log 1 w t 1 t 2 dt 1 2 log 1 t 2 1 t 2 dt taking sup s over all p satisfying 2 5 gives log i 1 log 1 w t 1 t 2 dt 1 2 log 1 t 2 1 t 2 dt as we assumed bernstein s approximation problem has a positive solution lemma 2 1 shows that i and hence 2 3 follows weighted approximation 9 with a little more work this proof also gives log t 1 t 2 dt see 67 p 153 3 weighted jackson and bernstein theorems in the 1950 s the search began for quantitative estimates rather than theorems establishing the possibility of approximation bernstein and jackson had provided quantitative forms of weierstrass theorem in 1911 and 1912 two wonderful years for approximation theory recall first the classical unweighted case jackson and bernstein independently proved that en f inf deg p n f p l 1 1 c n f l 1 1 3 1 with c independent of f and n and the inf being over algebraic polynomials of degree at most n the rate is best possible amongst absolutely continuous functions f on 1 1 whose derivative is bounded more generally if f has a bounded kth derivative then the rate is o n k in addition jackson obtained general results involving moduli of continuity for example if f is continuous and its modulus of continuity is f sup f x f y x y 1 1 and x y then en f c f 1 n where c is independent of f and n bernstein also obtained remarkable converse theorems which show that the rate or degree of approximation is determined by the smoothness of f these are most elegantly stated for trigonometric polynomial approximation let en g inf deg r n g r l 0 2 denote the distance from a periodic function g to the set of all trigonometric polynomials r of degree n let 0 1 bernstein showed that en g o n n g t o t t 0 where g is the modulus of continuity of g on 0 2 defined much as above that is the error of approximation of a 2 periodic function g on 0 2 by trigonometric polynomials of degree at most n decays with rate n iff g satisfies a lipschitz condition of order moreover if k 1 en g o n k n g k t o t t 0 here in the converse implication the existence and continuity of the kth derivative g k is assured bernstein never resolved the exact smoothness required for a rate of decay of n 1 or more generally d s lubinsky 10 o n k the case k 1 was solved much later in 1945 by a zygmund the father of the chicago school of harmonic analysis and author of the classic trigonometric series 193 zygmund used a second order modulus of continuity for approximation by algebraic polynomials converse theorems are more complicated as better approximation is possible near the endpoints of the interval of approximation only in the 1980 s were complete characterizations obtained with the aid of the ditzian totik modulus of continuity 36 an earlier alternative approach is that of brudnyi dzadyk timan 31 we shall discuss only the ditzian totik approach since that has been adopted in weighted polynomial approximation define the symmetric differences hf x f x h 2 f x h 2 2 hf x h hf x khf x h k 1 h f x so that khf x k i 0 k i 1 if x k h 2 ih 3 2 if any of the arguments of f lies outside the interval of approximation 1 1 in this setting we adopt the convention that the difference is 0 the rth order ditzian totik modulus of continuity in lp 1 1 is r f h p sup 0 h t r h 1 x 2 f x lp 1 1 note the factor x 1 x 2 multiplying the increment h this forces a smaller increment near the endpoints 1 of 1 1 reflecting the possibility of better approximation rates there for 1 p ditzian and totik 36 thm 7 2 1 p 79 proved the estimate en f p inf deg p n f p lp 1 1 c r f 1 n p with c independent of f and n this implies the jackson or jackson favard estimate 31 p 260 en f p cn r rf r lp 1 1 n r provided f r 1 is absolutely continuous and the norm on the right hand side is finite moreover they showed that if 0 r then 31 p 265 en f p o n n 3 3 iff r f h p o h h 0 for example if 3 3 holds with 31 2 this implies that f has 3 continuous derivatives inside 1 1 and f satisfies a lipschitz condition of order 1 2 in each compact subinterval of 1 1 weighted approximation 11 this equivalence is easily deduced from the jackson inequality above and the general converse inequality 36 theorem 7 2 4 p 83 r f t p mt r 0 n 1 t n 1 r 1 en f p t 0 1 the constant m depends on r but is independent of f and t of course this subject has a long and rich history and all we are attempting here is to set the background for developments in weighted approximation please forgive the many themes omitted for weights on the whole real line the first attempts at general jackson theorems seem due to dzrbasjan 37 he obtained the correct weighted rates but only when restricting the approximated function to a finite interval in the 1960 s and 1970 s freud and nevai made major strides in this topic 150 that 1986 survey of paul nevai is still relevant and a very readable introduction to the subject let us review some of the fundamental features discovered by freud in the case of the weight w x exp x 1 a little calculus shows that the weighted monomial xnw x attains its maximum modulus on the real line at freud s number qn n 1 thereafter it decays quickly to zero with this in mind freud and nevai proved that there are constants c 1 and c 2 such that for all polynomials pn of degree at most n pnw lp r c 2 pnw lp c 1 n 1 c 1 n 1 3 4 the constants c 1 and c 2 can be taken independent of n pn and even the lp parameter p 1 outside the interval c 1 n 1 c 1 n 1 pnw decays quickly to zero this meant that one cannot hope to approximate fw by pnw outside c 1 n 1 c 1 n 1 so either a tail term fw lp x c 1 n 1 must appear in the error estimate or be handled some other way inequalities of the form 3 4 are called restricted range inequalities or infinite finite range inequalities the sharp form of these was found later by mhaskar and saff using potential theory 136 138 139 140 167 let w exp q where q is even and xq x is positive and increasing in 0 with limits 0 and at 0 and respectively for n 1 let an an q denote the positive root of the equation n 2 1 0 antq ant 1 t 2 dt 3 5 we call an the nth mhaskar rakhmanov saff number for example if 0 and w x exp x an 2 2 2 2 1 n 1 mhaskar and saff established the mhaskar saff identity for polynomials pn of degree at most n pnw l r pnw l an an 3 6 moreover if pn is not the zero polynomial pnw l r an an pnw l an an d s lubinsky 12 and an is asymptotically the smallest such number there are lp analogues valid for all p 0 for example if 0 there exists c 0 such that for n 1 and polynomials pn of degree n pnw lp r an 1 an 1 e cn pnw lp an an 3 7 we shall discuss these more in section 4 6 the next task is to determine what happens on can can now if we had to approximate in the unweighted setting on this interval a scale change in the jackson bernstein estimate 3 1 gives inf deg p n f p l can can cc 1 an n f l can can remarkably the same is true when we insert the weight w in both norms inf deg p n f p w l can can c 3 an n f w l can can 3 8 very roughly this works for the following reason it seems that if c is small enough we can approximate 1 w on can can by a polynomial rn 2 of degree n 2 and then use the remaining part n 2 degree polynomial in p to approximate fw itself on can can in real terms this approach works only for a small class of weights nevertheless it at least indicated the form that general results should take to obtain an estimate over the whole real line freud then proved a tail inequality such as fw lp x can c 4 an n f w lp r 3 9 with c 4 independent of f and n combining 3 8 3 9 and that suitable weighted polynomials are tiny outside c 1 an c 1 an yielded the following theorem 3 1 let 1 p 1 and f r r be absolutely continuous with f w lp r then en f w p inf deg p n f p w lp r c 5 an n f w lp r 3 10 with c 5 independent of f and n while this might illustrate some of the ideas we emphasize that the technical details underlying proper proofs of this jackson or jackson favard inequality are formidable some of these ideas will be illustrated in the next section freud and nevai developed an original theory of orthogonal polynomials for the weights w 2 partly for use in this approximation theory we note that freud proved 3 10 for w for 2 41 42 the technical estimates required to extend this to the case 1 2 were provided by eli levin and the author 80 what about 1 well recall that the polynomials are only dense if 1 so there is no point in considering 1 but 1 is still worth consideration and we shall discuss that below in section 5 one consequence of 3 10 is an estimate of the rate of weighted polynomial approximation of f in terms of that of f indeed if pn is any polynomial of degree n 1 then en f w p en f pn w p c 5 an n f pn w lp r weighted approximation 13 and since p n may be any polynomial of degree n 1 we obtain the favard or jackson favard inequality en f w p c 5 an n en 1 f w p 3 11 this can be iterated corollary 3 2 let 1 p r 1 1 and f r r have r 1 continuous derivatives assume moreover that f r is absolutely continuous with f r w lp r then for some c independent of f and n en f w p c 5 an n r f r w lp r 3 12 freud also obtained estimates involving moduli of continuity here one cannot avoid the tail term and has to build it directly into the modulus partly for this reason there are many forms of the modulus and more than one way to decide which interval is the principal interval and over what interval we take the tail however it is done it is awkward we shall follow essentially the modulus used by ditzian and totik 36 ditzian and the author 33 and mhaskar 136 all these owe a great deal to earlier work of freud the first order modulus for the weight w has the form 1 p f w t sup 0 h t w hf lp h 1 1 h 1 1 inf c r f c w lp r t 1 1 t 1 1 why the inf over the constant c in the tail term it ensures that if f is constant then the modulus vanishes identically as one expects from a first order modulus why the strange interval h 1 1 h 1 1 it ensures that when we substitute h n 1 n n 1 1 then h 1 1 h 1 1 n 1 n 1 c 1 an c 1 an for an appropriate constant c 1 independent of n more generally if r 1 the rth order modulus is r p f w t sup 0 h t w rhf lp h 1 1 h 1 1 inf deg p r 1 f p w lp r t 1 1 t 1 1 3 13 again the inf in the tail term ensures that if f is a polynomial of degree r 1 then the modulus of continuity vanishes identically as is expected from an rth order modulus the jackson theorem takes the form en f w p c r p f w an n 3 14 this is valid for 1 p and the constant c is independent of f and n but depends on p and w d s lubinsky 14 one can consider more general weights than w almost invariably the weight considered has the form w exp q and the rate of growth of q has a major impact on the form of the modulus let us suppose for example that q is of polynomial growth at the so called freud case the most general class of such weights for which a jackson theorem is known is the following it includes w 1 but excludes w 1 definition 3 3 freud weights let w exp q where q r r is even q exists and is positive in 0 moreover assume that xq x is strictly increasing with right limit 0 at 0 and for some a b 1 c 0 a q x q x b x c 3 15 then we write w f for suchw we take an to be the positive root of the equation 3 5 the existence and uniqueness of an is guaranteed by the strict monotonicity of xq x to replace the function t 1 1 we can use the decreasing function of t t inf an an n t t 0 3 16 the modulus of continuity becomes r p f w t sup 0 h t w rhf lp h h inf deg p r 1 f p w lp r t t 3 17 the reader new to this subject will be encouraged to hear that this strange looking creature has all the main properties of more familiar moduli of continuity 33 35 36 48 78 136 theorem 3 4 properties of r p let w f r 1 0 p let f r r and if p assume that fw lp r if p assume in addition that f is continuous and that fw has limit 0 at a r p f w t is an increasing function of t 0 b lim t 0 r p f w t 0 c assume that p 1 or assume that w admits a markov bernstein inequality p w lp r c n an pw lp r 3 18 valid for n 1 and polynomials p of degree n where c 6 c n p then there exists c 1 6 c 1 t f such that

let r 1 there exists c 6 c f t such that r p f w t c r 1 p f w t t 0 3 19 f assume the markov bernstein inequality 3 18 then if q min 1 p there is the marchaud inequality r p f w t c 1 tr c 2 t q r 1 f w u urq 1 du fw q lp r 1 q where cj 6 cj f t j 1 2 g assume that 1 and 0 p q then there is the ulyanov type inequality r q f w t c t 0 u 1 q 1 p r p f w u q du u 1 q t 0 where c 6 c f t h assume that p 1 and for some 0 r r p f w t o t t 0 3 20 let k the integer part of then f k exists a e in the real line and r k p f k w t o t k t 0 3 21 if p f k is continuous on the real line proof a this is immediate as t is a decreasing function of t b this follows as for classical moduli of continuity one first establishes it for suitably re stricted continuous functions and then approximates an arbitrary function by a continuous one c this is part of theorem 1 4 in 33 p 104 d this is part of corollary 1 8 in 33 p 105 e this follows easily from the definition 3 13 and the recursive definition of the symmetric differences f this is corollary 1 7 in 33 p 105 g this is part of theorem 9 1 in 35 p 133 h see 36 pp 62 64 for the analogous proofs on a finite interval d s lubinsky 16 note all the strictures for p 1 fundamentally these arise because we cannot bound norms of functions in terms of their derivatives when p 1 at least the jackson theorem is the obvious analogue of the result for finite intervals 33 theorem 1 2 p 102 theorem 3 5 let w f r 1 and 0 p let fw lp r if p we also require f to be continuous and fw to have limit 0 at then for n r 1 en f w p c 1 r p f w c 2 an n 3 22 where c 1 and c 2 are independent of f and n in the case where p 1 or w admits the markov bernstein inequality 3 18 one can omit the constant c 2 inside the modulus this follows directly from theorem 3 4 c we shall say much more about markov bernstein inequalities in section 7 corollary 3 6 let 1 p r 1 w f and f r r have r 1 continuous derivatives assume moreover that f r is absolutely continuous with f r w lp r then for some c independent of f and n en f w p c 5 an n r f r w lp r 3 23 the converse inequality which can be interpreted as a bernstein type converse theorem has the form 33 p 105 theorem 3 7 let 0 p r 1 w f assume that w admits the markov bernstein inequality 3 18 let q min 1 p for t a 1 define the positive integer n n t by n n t inf k ak k t 3 24 then for some c 6 c t f r p f w t q c an n rq log 2 n j 1 2 j a 2 j rq e 2 j f w q p 3 25 where we define e 2 1 e 0 and log 2 n denotes the largest integer log 2 n from this one readily deduces corollary 3 8 assume the hypotheses of the previous theorem and let 0 r then r p f w t o t t 0 en f w p o an n n a related smoothness theorem is given by damelin 14 one of the important tools in establishing this is k functionals and the concept of realization this is a topic on its own in the setting of weighted polynomial approximation it has been explored weighted approximation 17 by freud and mhaskar and later ditzian and totik damelin and the author see 11 27 33 44 45 136 137 in our context an appropriate k functional is kr p f w t r inf g f g w lp r t r g r w lp r t 0 where the inf is taken over all g whose r 1 st derivative is locally absolutely continuous it works only for p 1 again because of the problems of estimating functions in lp p 1 in terms of their derivatives the k functional is equivalent to the modulus of continuity in the following sense 33 thm 1 4 cor 1 9 pp 104 105 theorem 3 9 let w f and p 1 then for some c 1 c 2 0 independent of f t c 1 r p f w t kr p f w tr c 2 r p f w t the appearance of fairly general functions g in the inf defining kr p helps to explain its use fulness in fact many of the properties of the modulus described above go via the k functional when p 1 the k functional is identically zero so instead we use the realization functional introduced by hristov and ivanov 50 and analyzed by those authors and ditzian 32 kr p f w t r inf p f p w lp r t r p r w lp r t 0 here the inf is taken over all polynomials p of degree n t and n t is defined by 3 24 for p 1 kr p and kr p are equivalent 32 for all p one can prove 33 thm 1 4 p 104 theorem 3 10 assume w f and w admits the markov bernstein inequality 3 18 then for some c 1 c 2 0 independent of f t c 1 r p f w t kr p f w tr c 2 r p f w t observe that if we choose t an n the above result actually gives more than the jackson estimate theorem 3 5 at least when ak k decreases strictly with k we obtain inf deg p n f p w lp r an n r p r w lp r c 2 r p f w an n so there is an automatic bound on the rth derivatives of best approximating polynomials the freud weights above have the form w exp q where q is of polynomial growth at with q x growing at least as fast as x for some 1 for the special weight exp x the polynomials are still dense but we have not established anything about the degree of approximation we shall devote a separate section to this the case where q is of faster than polynomial growth is often called the erdo s case and also has received some attention the main difference is that the modulus of continuity becomes more complicated here is a suitable class of erdo s weights definition 3 11 erdo s weights let w exp q where q r r is even q exists and is positive in 0 assume that xq x is strictly increasing with right limit 0 at 0 and the function t x xq x q x 3 26 d s lubinsky 18 is quasi increasing in the sense that for some c 0 0 x y t x ct y 3 27 while lim x t x assume moreover that for some c 1 c 2 and c 3 0 yq y xq x c 1 q y q x c 2 y x c 3 then we write w e examples of weights in this class include w x exp expk x expk 0 where 0 and for k 1 expk exp exp exp denotes the kth iterated exponential we set exp 0 x x for this weight t x x k 1 j 1 expj x for large x 85 p 9 while the mhaskar rakhmanov saff number has the asymptotic 85 p 29 an logk 1 log n 1 2 k 1 j 1 logj n o 1 1 logk n 1 1 o 1 n logk denotes the kth iterated logarithm for general w e the modulus of continuity involves the function t x 1 x t t t 1 2 where t is as in 3 16 one may think of this as an analogue of the function 1 x 2 which appears in the ditzian totik modulus of continuity and it appears for the same reason in ap proximating by polynomials with erdo s weights the rate of approximation improves towards the endpoints of the mhaskar rakhmanov saff interval the modulus is r p f w

converse estimates 11 16 27 the details are more difficult than for freud weights because of the more complicated modulus analogous results for exponential weights on 1 1 are given in 15 92 93 for exponential weights multiplied by a generalized jacobi weight or other factor having singularities see 49 120 121 122 178 for laguerre and other exponential weights on 0 see 28 62 115 geometric rates of approximation in the weighted setting have been explored in 70 127 128 135 136 4 methods for proving weighted jackson theorems in this section we shall outline various methods to prove weighted jackson theorems but will not provide complete expositions in the unweighted case on 1 1 many of the elegant meth ods involve convolution operators however unfortunately these depend heavily on translation invariance so fail for the weighted case we begin with two of the oldest used by freud and nevai 4 1 freud and nevai s one sided l 1 method the l 1 method is primarily a tool to obtain estimates on the degree of approximation for special functions such as characteristic functions once one has it one can use duality and other tricks to go to l and then interpolation for 1 p and this will be done in the next section the method is based on the theory of orthogonal polynomials and gauss quadratures under the tutelage of ge za freud and paul nevai the two subjects of weighted approximation and orthogonal polynomials for weights on the real line developed in tandem throughout the 1970 s and 1980 s mhaskar s monograph 136 provides an excellent treatment of the material in this and the next section corresponding to the weight w we define orthonormal polynomials pn x pn w 2 x nx n where n 0 satisfying pnpmw 2 mn note that the weight is w 2 not w this convention simplifies some formulations later on let us denote the zeros of pn by xnn xn 1 n x 2 n x 1 n the nth christoffel function for w 2 is n w 2 x inf deg p n 1 pw 2 p 2 x 4 1 d s lubinsky 20 it also satisfies n w 2 x 1 n 1 j 0 p 2 j x try this as an exercise expand an arbitrary polynomial of degree n 1 in pj n 1 j 0 and then use cauchy schwarz and orthonormality many readers unfamiliar with the detailed theory of orthogonal polynomials will nevertheless have seen the christoffel functions in the gauss quadrature formula pw 2 n j 1 n w 2 xjn p xjn valid for all polynomials p of degree 2 n 1 for fixed one can also develop similar quadrature formulae based on the zeros of pn x pn 1 pn 1 x pn these zeros are real and simple and include there are important inequalities the posse markov stieltjes inequalities that are used to analyze these quadratures in the simple gauss case they assert that if f is a function with its first 2 n 1 derivatives positive in xkn then n j k 1 n w 2 xjn f xjn xkn fw 2 n j k n w 2 xjn f xjn see 38 p 33 136 p 13 this may be used to prove 136 p 17 lemma 4 1 let n 1 and xk 1 n xkn then there exist upper and lower polynomials r and r such that r r in r and r r w 2 n w 2 xkn n w 2 xk 1 n thus once we have upper estimates on the christoffel functions we have bounds on the error of one sided polynomial approximation one could write a survey on methods to estimate christoffel functions there are so many paul nevai paid homage to them and their applications in his still relevant survey article 150 as well as in his earlier memoir 148 we shall present a very simple method of freud in a very special case lemma 4 2 assume that w exp q f and in addition that q is convex then there exists c 1 c 2 0 such that for n 1 and c 1 an n w 2 c 2 an n w 2 4 2 weighted approximation 21 proof let em x m j 0 xj j denote the mth partial sum of the exponential function fix n and let r x w 1 e n 2 x q here n 2 denotes the integer part of n 2 now e n 2 u c 2 exp u for u n 8 moreover given 0 we have if x 2 an and an x q 3 anq an n 8 4 3 if only is small enough to see this we use the definition of an and the monotonicity of t 7 tq t n 2 1 0 antq ant 1 t 2 dt 2 1 1 2 dt 1 t 2 an 2 q an 2 thus anq an 2 c 1 n using the lower bound in 3 15 of definition 3 3 we obtain for m 1 anq m an 2 a manq an 2 c 1 a mn there we had a 1 so choosing m 2 with large enough m gives 4 3 next r x c 2 w 1 exp x q c 2 exp q x q c 2 exp q x by convexity of q thus r x w x c 2 for all x 2 an moreover rw 1 now we use the extremal property 4 1 of christoffel functions we set p r there where is a polynomial of degree n 2 we see that n w 2 w 2 inf deg p n pw 2 pw 2 inf deg n 2 rw 2 rw 2 c inf deg n 2 2 an 2 an rw 2 rw 2 d s lubinsky 22 by the restricted range inequality 3 7 now we use the upper bound on rw and rw 1 to continue this as cc 22 inf deg n 2 2 an 2 an 2 2 cc 222 an inf deg s n 2 1 1 s 2 s 2 2 an the latter is the christoffel function of order n 2 for the legendre weight on 1 1 evaluated at 2 an using classical estimates for these 38 p 103 we continue this as n w 2 w 2 c an n now we present a very special case of the l 1 approximation theorem 4 3 assume the hypotheses of lemma 4 2 on w assume that f is continuous and f w 2 l 1 r while f is of polynomial growth at then there exist upper and lower polynomials sn and sn such that sn f sn in r 4 4 and sn sn w 2 c an n f w 2 f w 2 l x can main idea of the proof we assume that f 0 and that f 0 outside xnn x 1 n to simplify the proof recall that xnn and x 1 n are the largest and smallest zeros of pn w 2 x we write the fundamental theorem of calculus f x f 0 x 0 f d in the form f x f 0 0 1 x f d 0 x f d to check this consider separately x 0 and x 0 we use the upper and lower polynomials r and r of lemma 4 1 and define sn x f 0 0 1 r x f d 0 r x f d and sn x f 0 0 1 r x f d 0 r x f d as f 0 and r r we obtain 4 4 moreover sn sn x r r x f d weighted approximation 23 so sn sn w 2 r r x w 2 x dx f d now by lemmas 4 1 and 4 2 and some other minor considerations r r x w 2 x dx c an n w 2 at least for can thus sn sn w 2 c an n can can f w 2 f w 2 l x can can w 2 r r x w 2 x dx d the first term on the right hand side has the correct form the second tail term does not one can still use estimates for christoffel functions and some other tricks see 40 46 or 136 p 83 ff for more details this is what freud proved in 1974 40 p 297 using these ideas theorem 4 4 let q be an even and convex function on the real line assume that q is increasing and q exists in 0 and that for some c 1 c 2 0 1 c 1 q 2 x q x 1 c 2 let r 0 and f r be of bounded variation over every finite interval and of polynomial growth at satisfying for some a b 0 and integer m f x a bx 2 m then there exist upper and lower polynomials sn and sn of degree n such that 4 4 holds and sn sn w 2 c an n r 1 w 2 df r a b the constant c is independent of f n a b while this is a one sided l 1 result it also implies en f w 2 1 c an n r 1 w 2 df r a b this can be extended to other lp spaces using duality see 120 for an extension to weights with inner singularities d s lubinsky 24 4 2 freud s method involving de la valle e poussin means this is based on orthogonal expansions and for the finite interval was used before freud freud was the first to make it work on infinite intervals 41 42 for a measurable function for which fw 2 is finite we can form the orthonormal expansion f j 0 cjpj where cj fpjw 2 j 0 define the partial sums of the orthonormal expansion sn f n 1 j 0 cjpj the classic minimum property asserts that f sn f w l 2 r en 1 f w 2 inf deg p n 1 f p w l 2 r and the classic bessel s inequality asserts that sn f w l 2 r n 1 j 0 cj 2 1 2 fw l 2 r in particular sn is a uniformly bounded sequence of operators in a weighted l 2 space sometimes it is more convenient to use the de la valle e poussin operators vn f 1 n 2 n j n 1 sj f we see that still vn f w l 2 r fw l 2 r so the vn are uniformly bounded in this weighted l 2 setting they also reproduce polynomials vn p p if p is a polynomial of degree n 1 however they are not projection operators as vn p is a polynomial of degree 2 n 1 in general the real advantage is that in spaces other than l 2 vn is often uniformly bounded when sn is not another crucial ingredient are estimates for the christoffel functions defined by 4 1 let us outline some of the main ideas of freud s method to prove the jackson favard inequality en f w p c an n en 1 f w p 4 5 weighted approximation 25 a we show that vn is a uniformly bounded sequence of linear operators first in l and then in l 1 using duality and then in lp 1 p using interpolation b we approximate a very special function something like a characteristic function in l 1 using the method of the previous section c we prove the estimate in l using vn and the special function d we extend to lp 1 p in our outline we shall do this only for p the first step is to show for some c 6 c n f that e 2 n f w f vn f w l r cen f w 4 6 lemma 4 5 the inequality 4 6 holds provided we assume the estimate 4 13 below proof the left inequality here is immediate as vn f is a polynomial of degree 2 n 1 it is the right hand inequality that requires work we follow freud 42 the idea goes back at least to torsten carleman the partial sum sm f admits the representation sm f x m 1 j 0 cjpj x f t km x t w 2 t dt 4 7 where km x t m 1 j 0 pj x pj t the christoffel darboux formula 38 asserts that km x t m 1 m pm x pm 1 t pm 1 x pm t x t 4 8 we now fix x and n and define g f x x ann x an n and h f g f r x ann x an n here s denotes the characteristic function of a set s thus g f in an interval of radius an n about x and is 0 elsewhere while h is the rest of f we have sm f x sm g x sm h x 4 9 d s lubinsky 26 now sm g x x an n x an n f t km x t w 2 t dt fw l r x an n x an n km x t w t dt fw l r 2 an n 1 2 x an n x an n k 2 m x t w 2 t dt 1 2 by the cauchy schwarz inequality here using orthogonality x an n x an n k 2 m x t w 2 t dt k 2 m x t w 2 t dt m 1 j 0 p 2 j x 2 n 1 j 0 p 2 j x 1 2 n w 2 x provided m 2 n thus for m 2 n sm g x fw l r 2 an n 12 n w 2 x 1 2 and hence averaging over sm n 1 m 2 n vn g x fw l r 2 an n 12 n w 2 x 1 2 4 10 now comes the clever idea let h t h t x t t r and denote its fourier coefficients with respect to pj by cj h so that h j 0 cj h pj we use the christoffel darboux formula 4 8 to write sm h x m 1 m pm x h t pm 1 t w 2 t dt pm 1 x h t pm t w 2 t dt m 1 m pm x cm 1 h pm 1 x cm h then summing and using cauchy schwarz vn h x 1 n max m 2 n m 1 m 2 2 n m 0 p 2 m x 1 2 2 n m 0 c 2 m h 1 2 4 11 weighted approximation 27 yet another clever idea use bessel s inequality on the fourier coefficients of h recall this holds for any orthogonal system in any inner product space 2 n m 0 c 2 m h m 0 c 2 m h hw 2 t t x ann f t w t t x 2 dt fw 2 l r 2 n an then 4 11 becomes vn h x 2 2 n max m 2 n m 1 m n an 12 n 1 w 2 x 1 2 finally combining this with 4 9 and 4 10 gives vn f x fw l r 2 n 1 w 2 x 1 2 2 an n 1 2 1 n max m 2 n m 1 m 2 2 n an 1 2 4 12 up to this stage we have not used any properties of the weight it s completely general but now we use lower bounds for the christoffel function n w 2 x c an n w 2 x x r n 1 4 13 and an upper bound max m 2 n m 1 m can 4 14 to deduce that uniformly for n 1 and x r vn f x w x c fw l r thus for some c 6 c n f vn f w l r c fw l r then for any polynomial p of degree n the reproducing property of vn gives f vn f w l r f p vn f p w l r f p w l r vn f p w l r 1 c f p w l r taking the inf over all p of degree n gives the right hand inequality in 4 6 we turn to the discussion of 4 13 and 4 14 for the latter we can just use restricted range inequalities if m 2 n m 1 m xpm 1 x pm x w 2 x dx c 2 am 2 am xpm 1 x pm x w 2 x dx c 2 am by cauchy schwarz the lower bound 4 13 is more difficult see for example 83 136 150 d s lubinsky 28 as an aside let us see how duality also gives this bound in l 1 we use duality of lp norms vn f w l 1 r sup g vn f gw 2 4 15 where the sup is over all measurable g with gw l r 1 sorry we used g above in a different sense now we use the self adjointness of vn vn f gw 2 fvn g w 2 4 16 this follows easily once we prove the self adjointness of sm sm f gw 2 fsm g w 2 we leave the latter as an exercise just substitute in the definitions of sm f and sm g combining 4 15 and 4 16 gives vn f w l 1 r sup g fvn g w 2 sup g fw l 1 r vn g w l r c fw l 1 r 4 17 using the case p with this bound we can finish off the rest of the proof as we did for the case p for 1 p one can use interpolation of operators it is possible to improve the estimate 4 6 to include factors that vanish near an reflecting improved approximation there see 101 a partially successful attempt to extend 4 5 to general exponential weights was given in 102 an obvious question is for which weights we have the lower bound 4 13 for the christoffel functions they have not been established for the class f of definition 3 3 however they were established in 83 for the following class definition 4 6 let w exp q where q exists and is positive in 0 while q is positive there with limit 0 at 0 and for some a b 1 a 1 xq x q x b 1 x 0 4 18 then we write w f for weaker but difficult to formulate hypotheses these estimates were proved in 85 an excellent exposition is given in 136 chapter 3 the christoffel function bound 4 13 there is proved assuming q is increasing this is true for w w if 2 while 4 18 holds for 1 the next step is an inequality that is a distant relative of hardy s inequality lemma 4 7 let n 1 and g be a function such that gpw 2 0 4 19 for all polynomials p of degree n then there exists c 6 c n g such that sup x r w x x 0 g c an n gw l r 4 20 weighted approximation 29 main idea of the proof fix x 0 and let x t w 2 t 0 x t for g as above and any polynomial p of degree n x 0 g g t x t w 2 t dt g t x t p t w 2 t dt gw l r x p w taking the inf over all such p gives x 0 g gw l r en x w 1 once we have the estimate w x en x w 1 c an n 4 21 for some c 6 c n x the result follows to prove this one can use one sided approximation as in section 4 1 see for example 42 p 34 now we can give the jackson favard inequality in the case p theorem 4 8 letw f let f be absolutely continuous in each finite interval with f w l r finite then for some c 6 c n f en f w c an n f w l r 4 22 and en f w c an n en 1 f w 4 23 proof let g x f x vn f x this does satisfy 4 19 indeed if p is a polynomial of degree n self adjointness of vn gives gpw 2 f pw 2 vn f pw 2 f pw 2 f vn p w 2 0 as vn p p next let un x f 0 x 0 vn f t dt d s lubinsky 30 so that f un x x 0 f vn f x 0 g then w f un l r w x 0 g l r can n gw l r c an n f vn f w l r an n en f w here we applied lemma 4 7 and then lemma 4 5 this also gives as un has degree 2 n e 2 n f w c an n en f w c an n f w l r replacing n by n 2 and using the fact that an 2 an we obtain en f w c an n f w l r finally we observe that for any polynomial p of degree n en f w en f p w c an n f p w l r choosing p suitably gives 4 23 for the extension to all 1 p see 136 chapter 4 4 3 the kroo szabados method the idea here 69 is to make use of the alternation equioscillation for best polynomial approxi mants together with some clever tricks on a finite interval the idea was used by bojanov 5 babenko and shalaev while it works quite generally it does not yield the correct jackson rate maybe some clever tweaking can repair that let us fix a function f and n 1 and let p n be its best polynomial approximation of degree n in the weighted uniform norm thus f p n w l r inf deg p n f p w l r en f w then there exist equioscillation points yj n 1 j 0 such that for 0 j n 1 f p n w yj 1 jen f w the number 1 1 is independent of j in terms of these there is the determinant expression en f w u f 1 xn y 0 y 1 yn 1 u g 1 xn y 0 y 1 yn 1 weighted approximation 31 where for functions j u 0 1 n 1 y 0 y 1 yn 1 det i yj n 1 i j 0 and g is a function such that gw yj 1 j 0 j n 1 a proof of this formula may be found in 170 p 28 by some elementary determinantal manipu lations one can show that u f 1 xn y 0 y 1 yn 1 1 n n k 0 1 k f yk 1 f yk bk and u g 1 xn y 0 y 1 yn 1 1 n 1 n k 0 w 1 yk 1 w 1 yk bk here bk is the determinant of a matrix with entries involving only yj then one obtains en f w n k 0 1 k f yk 1 f yk dk 4 24 where dk bk n j 0 w 1 yj 1 w 1 yj bj suppose we define the unusual modulus f t sup x y r x y t f x f y w x w y where 0 1 then from 4 24 en f w n k 0 dk w yk 1 w yk f yk 1 yk now one uses properties of the modulus and then has to estimate the dk this involves tricks such as needle polynomials here is a sample of what can be achieved theorem 4 9 let q r r be an even continuous function which is positive and differentiable for large x and with 0 lim inf x xq x q x lim sup x xq x q x 4 25 let q 1 denote the inverse of q defined for sufficiently large positive x for small n take q 1 n to be 1 assume that 0 1 and f r r is continuous with lim x f x w x 0 d s lubinsky 32 a then for some cj 6 cj f n en f w c 1 f q 1 n log n 1 n e c 2 n fw l r 4 26 b let 0 1 2 then for some c 6 c f n en f w c 1 f i 1 2 n 4 27 where for large enough n in q 1 n 1 q t t 2 dt 4 28 note that 4 25 requires less than we required for w f but the restrictions on f are more severe than in theorem 3 5 and instead of an n inside the modulus we obtain essentially an log n n the boundary case q x x satisfies the above conditions and in this case we obtain en f w c 1 f log n 1 2 here by choosing small enough the exponent of logn can be made arbitrarily close to 1 this method is interesting and general the challenge is how to tweak it if possible to get the correct jackson rate 4 4 the piecewise polynomial method this is undoubtedly the most direct and general method and ditzian and the author used it to prove theorem 3 5 however it does pose substantial technical challenges for finite intervals it has been used for a long time and in spirit goes back to lebesgue s proof of weierstrass theorem lebesgue first approximated by a piecewise linear function and then polynomials it has served as a powerful tool on finite intervals for example in investigating shape preserving polynomial approximation the degree of spline approximation and even approximation by rational functions 30 156 the function f is first approximated by a piecewise polynomial or spline each of the piecewise polynomials is generated via whitney s theorem then special polynomials that approximate characteristic functions are used to turn the spline approximation into a polynomial approximation we illustrate the method as it is used to prove theorem 3 5 for freud weights step 1 partition an an recall that our modulus r p involves a tail piece that will take care of the behavior of f x for very large x so we fix n and concentrate on approximation on the mhaskar rakhmanov saff interval an an we partition this interval into small intervals all of length an n an 0 1 2 2 n an set ij j j 1 0 j 2 n 1 weighted approximation 33 step 2 use whitney s theorem to develop a piecewise polynomial approximation we fix r this will be the order of the modulus we approximate f on ij by a polynomial pj of degree r and then form the piecewise polynomial s f p 0 2 n 1 j 1 pj pj 1 j an where as usual j an denotes the characteristic function of the interval j an when restricted to ik the sum becomes a telescopic sum we see that in the interior of ik namely in k k 1 s f p 0 k j 1 pj pj 1 pk then if p f s f w p lp an an 2 n 1 j 0 ij f pj w p c 2 n 1 j 0 w j p f pj plp ij 4 29 in this step we use the fact that because the intervals ij have length an n w does not grow or decay by more than a constant the idea is that for x y ik w x w y exp q y q x exp q x y exp q an n c 4 30 since q is bounded by c n an throughout an an this is true for freud weights in the class f but fails for erdo s weights now comes the application of whitney let i j ij ij 1 by whitney s theorem on the interval i j 156 p 195 p 191 we can choose pj of degree r such that f pj p lp i j c n an an n 0 i j rsf x p dx ds c p j here c is independent of f n j the strange creature on the right is really the pth power of an rth order integral modulus of continuity on the interval i j in forming the rth difference in this integral one uses the convention that the difference is taken as 0 if any of the arguments of the function are outside the interval i j substituting this in 4 29 and using 4 30 gives f s f w p lp an an c n an an n 0 an an w rsf x p dx ds c sup 0 h an n w rhf p lp an an 4 31 step 3 approximate the characteristic function j an now comes the difficult part we approximate j an by a polynomial rj of degree ln giving the polynomial p f p 0 2 n 1 j 1 pj pj 1 rj d s lubinsky 34 which is of degree at most ln r here the constant l is independent of n and arises in the challenging task of generating rj we see that then s f p f 2 n 1 j 1 pj pj 1 j an rj 4 32 to estimate this we compare pj and pj 1 on the common interval where they approximate f namely ij that is why we used whitney on i j ij ij 1 we obtain even for p 1 pj pj 1 lp ij c j 1 j now we use nikolskii inequalities which compare the norms of polynomials in lp and lq and the bernstein walsh inequality which bounds the growth of polynomials outside an interval once we know their size on the interval together they yield for all real x pj pj 1 x c n an 1 p 1 n an x j r j 1 j 4 33 again the constant c does not depend on x or n or f it does however depend on r which crucially remains fixed the n an factor arises from the length of ij suppose now that for a given j an rj x w x w j c 1 n an x j x r 4 34 where c is independent of f n j x then substituting this and 4 33 into 4

assumed step 4 construction of the rj recall we want rj of degree ln satisfying an rj x w x w c 1 n an x x r an an 4 37 with constants independent of n x the problem here is the w in the denominator it s tiny for close to an and we want rj to approximate 1 in an and to approximate 0 elsewhere in r one starts with an even entire function g x j 0 g 2 jx 2 j with all g 2 j 0 such that c 1 gw x c 2 x r such functions were constructed in 87 we let gn denote the nth partial sum one can show that gnw x c 1 x r and c 1 gnw x c 2 x c 1 an d s lubinsky 36 next we need needle or peaking polynomials vn built from chebyshev polynomials satisfying vn l 1 1 vn 1 vn t b 1 n t t 1 1 and vn t 1 2 t c 1 n the constants b c are independent of n x we define 33 p 121 rj x x 0 gln 4 s vn s a 2 ln lds 0 gln 4 s vn s a 2 ln lds where l and are appropriately chosen and aln to prove this works we split the integral into various pieces consider several ranges of x and reduce other ranges to the main range where s an for some fixed s all the details appear in 33 we note that for erdo s weights or exponential weights on 1 1 the technical details are still more complicated the subintervals ij of the an an are no longer of equal length see 27 92 93 5 weights close to exp x the weight exp x sits on the boundary of the class of weights admitting a positive solution to bernstein s problem that boundary is fuzzy but if you recall that w x exp x admits a positive solution iff 1 this makes sense so it is not surprising that results like jackson s theorem tend to take a different form freud was interested in this boundary case right throughout his research on weighted polynomial approximation in 1978 freud giroux and rahman 43 p 360 proved that en f w 1 1 inf deg p n f p w 1 l 1 r c f 1 log n x n fw 1 x dx where f sup h fw 1 x h fw 1 x dx fw 1 here c is independent of f and n and n could be replaced by n 1 for any fixed 0 1 compare the 1 log n inside the modulus to the n 1 1 we obtained for w 1 this suggests that lim 1 n 1 1 1 log n 5 1 at least in the sense of jackson rates ditzian the author nevai and totik 34 later extended this result to a characterization in l 1 the technique used by freud giroux and rahman was essentially an l 1 technique using the relation between one sided weighted approximation gauss quadratures and christoffel functions as we discussed in section 4 1 weighted approximation 37 only recently has it been possible to establish the analogous results in lp p 1 98 the author modified the spline method discussed in section 4 4 above the challenge is that however you tweak the construction of rj there it does not work so a new idea was needed as the peaking polynomials used there do not work for w 1 they were replaced by the reproducing kernel for orthogonal polynomials for w 21 and in the proofs the author needed bounds for these orthogonal polynomials implied by recent work of kriecherbauer and mclaughlin 68 if we examine the modulus used in 3 13 for w 1 we see that the interval h 1 1 h 1 1 is no longer meaningful for 1 it turns out to be replaced by exp 1 h exp 1 h for some fixed 0 1 the modulus becomes r p f w 1 t sup 0 h t w 1 rhf lp exp 1 t exp

may be a technical achievement it is scarcely surprising given that freud giroux and rahman already had the rate o 1 log n in the l 1 case what about a jackson favard inequality the limit 5 1 suggests that an analogue of 3 10 should have the form en f w 1 p c log n f w 1 lp r remarkably enough this is false and there is no jackson favard inequality for w 1 not even if we replace 1 log n by a sequence decreasing arbitrarily slowly to 0 more generally we answered in 99 the question which weights admit a jackson type theorem of the form 3 10 with an n n 1 replaced by some sequence n n 1 with limit 0 we proved 99 theorem 5 2 let w r 0 be continuous the following are equivalent a there exists a sequence n n 1 of positive numbers with limit 0 and with the following property for each 1 p and for all absolutely continuous f with f w lp r finite we have inf deg p n f p w lp r n f w lp r n 1 5 4 b both lim x w x x 0 w 1 0 5 5 and lim x w x 1 x w 0 5 6 with analogous limits as x d s lubinsky 38 two fairly direct corollaries of this are corollary 5 3 let w r 0 be continuous with w e q where q x is differentiable for large x and lim x q x and lim x q x 5 7 then there exists a sequence n n 1 of positive numbers with limit 0 such that for each 1 p and for all absolutely continuous f with f w lp r finite we have 5 4 corollary 5 4 let w r 0 be continuous with w e q where q x is differentiable for large x and q x is bounded for large x then for both p 1 and p there does not exist a sequence n n 1 of positive numbers with limit 0 satisfying 5 4 for all absolutely continuous f with f w lp r finite in particular for w 1 there is no jackson favard inequality since both 5 5 and 5 6 are false thus there is a real difference between density of weighted polynomials and weighted jackson favard theorems it is possible to have the former without the latter a key ingredient in the above theorem is an estimate for tails 99 theorem 5 5 assume that w r 0 is continuous a assumew satisfies 5 5 and 5 6 with analogous limits at then there exists a decreasing positive function 0 0 with limit 0 at such that for 1 p and 0 fw lp r f w lp r 5 8 for all absolutely continuous functions f r r for which f 0 0 and the right hand side is finite b conversely assume that 5 8 holds for p 1 and for p for large enough then the limits 5 5 and 5 6 in theorem 1 1 are valid with analogous limits at the above results deal with lp for all 1 p what happens if we focus on a single lp space we recently proved 100 theorem 5 6 let w r 0 be continuous and let 1 p and 1 p 1 q 1 the following are equivalent a there exists a sequence n n 1 of positive numbers with limit 0 and with the following property for all absolutely continuous f with f w lp r finite we have inf deg p n f p w lp r n f w lp r n 1 5 9 b lim x w 1 lq 0 x w lp x 0 5 10 with analogous limits as x weighted approximation 39 as a consequence one can construct weights that admit a jackson theorem in lp but not in lr for any 1 p r with p 6 r theorem 5 7 let 1 p r with p 6 r there exists w r 0 such that 1 1 x 2 w x exp x 2 1 x 2 x r and w admits an lr jackson theorem but not an lp jackson theorem that is there exists n n 1 with limit 0 at satisfying 5 9 in the lr norm but there does not exist such a sequence satisfying 5 9 in the lp norm this is a highly unusual occurrence in weighted approximation in fact the first occurrence of this phenomenon known to this author density of polynomials and the degree of approximation is almost invariably the same for any lp space suitably weighted of course recall koosis remark quoted after theorem 1 6 67 pp 210 211 6 restricted range inequalities we have already seen the role played by restricted range inequalities often called infinite finite range inequalities in weighted jackson theorems paul nevai rated freud s discovery of these as one of his most important contributions to weighted approximation theory one is reminded of their import when one recalls that dzrbasjan did not have these and could only prove estimates in a fixed finite interval this should not detract from admiration for the generality of dzrbasjan s results and the sophistication of his ideas which are still being used let s recap a little recall that freud and nevai proved that there are constants c 1 and c 2 such that for all polynomials pn of degree at most n pnw lp r c 1 pnw lp c 1 n 1 c 1 n 1 6 1 the constants c 1 and c 2 can be taken independent of n pn and even the lp parameter p 1 outside the interval c 1 n 1 c 1 n 1 pnw decays quickly to zero for more general w exp q one replaces n 1 with freud s number qn the positive root of the equation n qnq qn if xq x is positive continuous and strictly increasing in 0 with limit 0 at 0 and at then qn exists and is unique theorem 6 1 assume that xq x is positive continuous and strictly increasing in 0 with limit 0 at 0 and at then for n 1 and polynomials p of degree n pw l r pw l 4 q 2 n 4 q 2 n 6 2 d s lubinsky 40 proof this type of proof was used many times by freud and nevai see also the monograph 136 p 66 recall that if tn is the classical chebyshev polynomial then for x 1 and polynomials p of degree n p x tn x p l 1 1 2 x n p l 1 1 6 3 scaling this to q 2 n q 2 n and using the fact that q is increasing in 0 gives p x 2 x q 2 n n p l q 2 n q 2 n 2 x q 2 n n w 1 q 2 n pw l q 2 n q 2 n so pw x 2 n x nw x qn 2 nw q 2 n pw l q 2 n q 2 n now if x 4 q 2 n log xnw x qn 2 nw q 2 n x q 2 n n uq u u du n 4 q 2 n q 2 n du u n log 4 since u q 2 n uq u 2 n substituting in above gives for x 4 q 2 n pw x 2 n pw l q 2 n q 2 n this certainly implies 6 2 the proof clearly shows the exponential decay of pw outside the interval q 2 n q 2 n which depends only on n in lp any p 0 a typical analogue is pw lp r 1 e cn pw lp bq 2 n bq 2 n where c 0 and b is large enough these inequalities are sufficient for weighted jackson and bernstein theorems but not for some of the deeper results such as bernstein inequalities with endpoint effects or convergence of or thogonal expansions or lagrange interpolation let alone asymptotics of orthogonal polynomials with such questions in mind mhaskar and saff asked in the early 1980 s where does the sup or lp norm of a weighted polynomial really live clearly it is inside the intervals bq 2 n bq 2 n with appropriate b but what is the best b in seminal papers 138 139 140 they used potential theory to obtain the answer in another seminal development e a rakhmanov a little earlier 166 developed the same potential theory in order to investigate asymptotics of orthogonal polynomials one of the best ways to understand their work is to recall bernstein s bound for growth of polynomials in the complex plane for n 1 polynomials p of degree n and z 1 1 p z z z 2 1 n p l 1 1 thus once we have a bound on p on an interval we can estimate its growth outside of course it is related to the inequality involving tn that we used above but that works only for real x now let us look for a weighted analogue for even weights w exp q where say x 7 xq x is increasing positive and continuous in 0 suppose that a 0 and we have a function g gn a with the following properties weighted approximation 41 i g is analytic and non vanishing in c a a ii g z zn has a finite limit as z iii g z w x as z x a a then given a polynomial p of degree n the function pg is analytic in c a a including at where it has a finite limit moreover for x a a lim z x pg z pw x pw l a a by the maximum modulus principle we then obtain pg z pw l a a z a a in particular for real x with x a pw x pw l a a w x gn a x for a given n mhaskar and saff found the smallest a an for which w x gn a x 1 for all x a 6 4 clearly we then have pw x pw l an an x an and the mhaskar saff identity pw l r pw l an an recall that an is called the mhaskar rakhmanov saff number and is the positive root of the equation n 2 1 0 antq ant 1 t 2 dt 6 5 for the weight w x exp x 0 an 2 2 2 2 1 n 1 how does this arise and how does one find the function gn a we solve the integral equation 1 1 log x t n a t dt q ax n cn a x 1 1 6 6 for the function n a and some constant cn a subject to the condition a a n a 1 d s lubinsky 42 by formal differentiation we see that this is really equivalent to solving a singular integral equation 1 1 n a t x t dt aq ax n x a a the integral on the left is a cauchy principal value integral there is a well developed theory of such equations 47 167 one can show that 111 p 37 136 p 124 ff n a x 2 2 1 0 1 x 2 1 s 2 asq as axq ax n s 2 x 2 ds bn a 1 x 2 6 7 where bn a 1 2 n 1 0 atq at 1 t 2 dt 6 8 then the function gn a is given by gn a z exp n 1 1 log z a t n a t dt ncn a so that for x a a gn a x exp n 1 1 log x a t n a t dt ncn a w x by 6 6 so at least we have verified iii above it turns out that whenever bn a 0 then w gn a 1 in some right neighborhood of 1 thus we look for the smallest a for which bn a 0 we see from 6 8 that this requires 1 2 n 1 0 atq at 1 t 2 dt 0 a an this scratches the surface of an extensive theory the monograph of saff and totik 167 contains a detailed and deep development a more elementary treatment is provided in 136 though that will be more than sufficient for those interested only in the topics of this survey for general exponential weights restricted range inequalities in quite precise form are investigated in 85 here is a typical result 85 theorem 1 8 p 15 136 thm 6 2 4 p 142 theorem 6 2 let q r 0 be even and convex with limit at and 0 q 0 q x x 6 0 a for not identically zero polynomials p of degree n pw l r pw l an an and pw

smaller estimate for the tail and this is possible provided we omit a little more than the mhaskar saff interval here is what can be achieved 85 thm 1 9 p 15 for the class of weights f specified in

back a little inside the mhaskar saff interval if we allow a cruder estimate on the tail 85 theorem 4 2 a p 96 theorem 6 5 assume in addition to the hypotheses of theorem 6 4 that q exists and is positive in 0 while for some c 0 and large enough x q x q x cq x q x let 0 p and 0 then there exists n 0 and c such that for n n 0 and polynomials p of degree n pw lp r c pw an 1 n an 1 n 6 11 where n nt an 2 3 6 12 see 57 61 85 134 136 145 167 for further discussion of restricted range inequalities d s lubinsky 44 7 markov bernstein inequalities markov bernstein inequalities have already been mentioned above they are the main ingredient of converse theorems of approximation but also enter in many other contexts for the unweighted case on 1 1 the classical markov inequality asserts that p l 1 1 n 2 p l 1 1 7 1 for n 1 and all polynomials p of degree n the bernstein inequality improves this as long as we stay away from the endpoints p x n 1 x 2 p l 1 1 x 1 1 7 2 for n 1 and all polynomials p of degree n the weights w x exp x 0 already provide a lot of insight into the weighted case on the real line the analogue of the markov inequality is p nw lp r c pnw lp r n 1 1 1 log n 1 1 1 1 7 3 this is valid for all n 1 and polynomials pn of degree n the constant c depends on p 0 and but not on n or p it s no accident that the factors arising are similar to those in the jackson rates and for 1 the factor is bounded independent of n for 2 these inequalities were proved by freud for 1 2 by eli levin and the author and for 1 by paul nevai and vili totik in order to generalize this for arbitrary q we should try to cast this estimate in a unified form for 1 we see that n 1 1 c 1 n an c 2 q an where q x x and recall an c 1 n 1 as we shall see q an is the correct factor whenever w exp q and q is even and grows faster than x for some 1 for freud weights where q is of polynomial growth but still grows faster than x for some 1 we can use n an however for all polynomial rates of growth including x 1 we can use cn 1 ds q 1 s where if q is strictly increasing and continuous on 0 q 1 denotes its inverse the most general l result for q of polynomial growth with this factor is due to kroo and szabados 69 p 48 theorem 7 1 let w exp q where q is even continuous increasing in 0 and twice differentiable for large enough x with lim inf x xq x q x 0 7 4 weighted approximation 45 and lim sup x xq x q x 7 5 then for n 1 and all polynomials p of degree n p w l r cn 1 ds q 1 s pw l r here c 6 c n p the author and eli levin used the slightly more restrictive condition that w f so 4 18 holds this implies like 7 4 and 7 5 that q grows faster than some positive power of x but slower than some other positive power of x strangely enough there does not seem to be a published form of this result in lp indeed extra difficulties arise in lp we shall discuss techniques for proving markov bernstein inequalities in the next section however there are results that apply to lp separately for the case where q grows faster or slower than x first we record the former case 84 p 231 theorem 7 2 let w f let 1 p then for n 1 and all polynomials p of degree n p w lp r c n an pw lp r here c 6 c n p this was later extended to the case 0 p 1 85 corollary 1 16 p 21 for weights growing slower than x nevai and totik 151 thm 2 p 122 used a beautiful method to prove theorem 7 3 let w exp q where q is even increasing and concave in 0 with 0 q x 1 x 2 dx then for n 1 and all polynomials p of degree n p w l r c pw l r here c 6 c n p if in addition lim x 2 q x q 2 x log x then given p 0 we have for n 1 and all polynomials p of degree n p w lp r c pw lp r here c 6 c n p d s lubinsky 46 the above are all markov inequalities analogues of 7 3 there are also bernstein inequalities which reflect the opposite feature of the finite interval case the growth in n decreases towards the end of the mhaskar rakhmanov saff interval to state these we need the function n x max 1 x an n 2 3 x r eli levin and the author proved 84 thm 1 1 p 231 theorem 7 4 let w f and let 1 p then for n 1 and all polynomials p of degree n pw 1 2 n lp r c n an pw lp r here c 6 c n p for p this was proved in 82 and for 1 p in 84 if p we see that this has the consequence pw an c n 2 3 an pw l r when p has degree n there is in 84 thm 1 2 p 233 an analogue of this for weights satisfying 4 18 in definition 4 6 with a 0 only such as exp x 1 one fixes 0 1 and proves that pw 1 2 n lp x an c n an pw lp r note that in the bernstein inequalities it is essential that we estimate pw and not p w there is no improvement for the latter at least in general near an analogues of markov and bernstein inequalities have also been obtained for erdo s weights where q is of faster than polynomial growth as well as for exponential weights on 1 1 they are also available for non even exponential weights on a possibly asymmetric finite or infinite interval 85 for simplicity we quote only the even case first we define a suitable class of weights which includes both the freud and erdo s weights in the real line and exponential weights on 1 1 definition 7 5 let i d d where 0 d let q i 0 be an even function with the following properties a q is continuous and positive in i and q 0 0 b q exists and is positive in 0 d c lim t d q t d the function t t tq t q t is quasi increasing in 0 d in the sense that 0 x y d t x ct y weighted approximation 47 moreover for some 1 t t 1 t 0 d e there exists c 1 0 such that q x q x c 1 q x q x x 0 d then we write w feven c 2 if also there exists c 0 d such that q x q x c 2 q x q x x c d then we write w feven c 2 examples of weights satisfying this are w 1 as well as w exp q where q x exp x exp 0 x 7 6 with 1 1 and exp exp exp denoting the th iterated exponential we set exp 0 x x others include q x exp 1 x 2 exp 1 x 1 1 7 7 where now 0 and 0 theorem 7 6 let 0 p and w e q feven c 2 for n 1 let n x an n 1 x a 2 n 1 x an nt an 2 3 7 8 then for n 1 and polynomials pn of degree n pw n lp r c pw lp r moreover p w lp r c n an t an 1 2 pw lp r this result is a special case of theorem 1 15 and corollary 1 16 in 85 p 21 there the restrictions on q are weaker but the definition of the classes is more implicit so we restrict ourselves to the smallest even case considered there the main feature is the extra factor t an 1 2 which really is there weighted extremal polynomials attain it see 85 as examples q of 7 6 has markov factor 85 p 30 n an t an 1 2 n log n 1 j 1 logj n 1 2 d s lubinsky 48 here logj log log log denotes the jth iterated logarithm for q of 7 7

outline some of the methods that have been used to prove markov bernstein inequalities for exponential weights an extensive treatment of markov bernstein inequalities for both weighted and unweighted cases is given in 9 143 we begin with 8 1 freud s method via de la valle e poussin means recall that in lemma 4 5 we proved vn f w l r c fw l r where c 6 c n f thereafter at 4 17 we showed how duality can be used to prove vn f w l 1 r c fw l 1 r where c 6 c n f in much the same way one can prove that when w f v n f w l r c n an fw l r 8 1 the main new technical ingredient required is the estimate 1 n 1 k 0 p k 2 c an n 3 w 2 r 8 2 this is a cousin of the christoffel function estimate 4 13 and can be proved using much the same ideas freud did this in 42 a proof is also given in 136 p 64 now if p is a polynomial of degree n then vn p p so 8 1 immediately gives the l markov bernstein inequality p w l r c n an pw l r weighted approximation 49 to extend this to l 1 we use duality on v n v n f w l 1 r sup v n f gw 2 8 3 where the sup is taken over all measurable functions g with gw l r 1 next we use the fact that if p is a polynomial of degree 2 n then g v 4 n g pw 2 0 indeed we can prove this by considering the special case p pj 0 j 2 n and recalling that the first 2 n fourier series coefficients with respect to pj of v 4 n g are the same as those of g the above considerations and an integration by parts give v n f gw 2 v n f v 4 n g w 2 vn f v 4 n g w 2 2 vn f v 4 n g q w 2 8 4 here vn f v 4 n g w 2 v 4 n g w l r vn f w c n an gw l r fw l 1 r c n an fw l 1 r 8 5 in the second last line we used our l 1 bound 4 17 for vn and the l bound 8 1 for v n and in the last line we used our bound on the sup norm of gw to bound the second term in 8 4 one needs lemma 8 1 let h be absolutely continuous with h 0 0 then q hw l r c h w l r 8 6 proof observe that if x 0 q x h x w x q x w x x 0 h t dt h w l r q x w x x 0 w 1 t dt 8 7 we now assume that q is increasing and lim t q t q t 2 0 this latter condition is true for regularly behaved freud and erdo s weights such as f e choose a 0 such that q t q t 2 1 2 t a d s lubinsky 50 if x a an integration by parts gives x a w 1 t dt x a q t 1 q t w 1 t dt q t 1 w 1 t t x t a x a q t q t 2 w 1 t dt q x 1 w 1 x 1 2 x a w 1 t dt then x a w 1 t dt 2 q x 1 w 1 x and x a q x w x x a w 1 t dt 2 as q w is bounded in 0 we obtain x 0 q x w x x 0 w 1 t dt c a similar bound holds for x 0 and then we obtain 8 6 from 8 7 next we apply 8 6 to the second term in the right hand side of 8 4 with h v 4 n g v 4 n g 0 we obtain v 4 n g q w x v 4 n g x v 4 n g 0 q x w x v 4 n g 0 q x w x c v 4 n g w l r c v 4 n g 0 c n an gw l r c n an so vn f v 4 n g q w 2 c n an vn f w c n an fw l 1 r 8 8 combining 8 4 8 5 and 8 8 gives v n f w l 1 r c n an fw l 1 r thus recalling 8 1 we have that for both p 1 and p v n f w lp r c n an fw lp r by interpolation we obtain v n f w lp r c n an fw lp r weighted approximation 51 for all 1 p where c 6 c n p applying this with f p a polynomial of degree n gives p w lp r c n an pw lp r this method is elegant and yields more than just markov bernstein inequalities as we have seen we also obtain a proof of a jackson favard type inequality bounds on cesa ro means of orthogonal expansions and other useful information our main technical ingredients were bounds on christoffel functions and their derivative analogue 8 2 and some technical estimates involving q 8 2 replacing the weight by a polynomial this method is very simple but applies only to a limited class of weights suppose that for some fixed k 0 we have polynomials sn of degree kn with c 1 sn w c 2 in 2 an 2 an 8 9 and s n w c 3 n an in an an 8 10 these polynomials enable us to reduce weighted bernstein inequalities to classical unweighted bernstein inequalities if p is a polynomial of degree n then our restricted range inequalities give p w lp r c p w lp an an cc 1 1 p sn lp an an cc 11 psn lp an an ps n lp an an cc 11 2 n an psn lp 2 an 2 an n an pw lp an an by our hypotheses on s n and the classical bernstein inequality scaled from 1 1 to 2 an 2 an using 8 9 again we obtain p w lp r c pw lp r this works in any lp 0 p if p we can weaken the requirements on sn which can be made different for each x we only need the upper bound on s n at a given x and the lower bound on sn at that x but we still need the upper bound on sn throughout 2 an 2 an freud and nevai used this for weights like w 2 m x exp x 2 m where m 1 is a positive integer the partial sums of these entire weights can be used for sn for w 1 eli levin and the author used canonical products of weierstrass primary factors such as n 1 e x n 1 to generate these polynomials 80 81 this method can provide quick easy proofs in special cases which would be useful for teaching a course on weighted approximation d s lubinsky 52 8 3 nevai totik s method this involves fast decreasing polynomials a topic initiated by kamen ivanov paul nevai and vili totik and works well for slowly decreasing weights such as w 1 let us suppose that for n 1 and some k 0 we have polynomials s n that satisfy s n 0 1 s n 0 0 8 11 and s n x ke q x x an an 8 12 typically s n has a unique maximum in 1 1 at 0 and decreases rapidly in 0 1 nevai and totik 151 used a construction of marchenko to generate such polynomials one starts with an entire function of the form b z k 1 sin 2 2 1 z tk 2 1 z tk 2 the product may be finite or infinite and the tk are positive numbers with t k 1 tk assuming that q is even increasing on 0 and 0 q x 1 x 2 dx 8 13 one can choose tk such that t 1 and b x k exp q x x r in this case b is an entire function of exponential type 1 assuming 8 13 nevai and totik used the partial sums of b to construct polynomials pn of degree n with a local maximum at 0 and pn 0 1 and pn x k exp q nx x 1 1 8 14 then s n x p an x an satisfies 8 11 and 8 12 and is of degree an it is easy to derive the markov inequality at 0 p w 0 p 0 ps n 0 n an an ps n l an an by the usual unweighted bernstein inequality we continue this as p w 0 c pw l an an 8 15 weighted approximation 53 using the property 8 12 and the fact that the convergence 8 13 implies n o an which we shall not prove to extend this to general x 0 we use the evenness and concavity of q which implies that for x y r w x w y w x y now apply 8 15 to the polynomial r y p x y w x for fixed x p w x r 0 w 0 c rw l r c sup y r p x y w x w y c sup y r p x y w x y c pw l r this method can be modified to give the correct markov inequality for w 1 nevai and totik were the first to do so 8 4 dzrbasjan kroo szabados method dzrbasjan was apparently the first researcher to investigate the degree of approximation for general exponential weights in his 1955 paper 37 although his approximation estimates worked only on a finite interval he nevertheless came up with a great many ideas kroo and szabados subsequently used dzrbasjan s method and restricted range inequalities to establish theorem 7 1 we start with cauchy s integral formula for derivatives or if you prefer cauchy s estimates p x 1 2 i t x p t t x 2 dt 1 sup p t t x the number 1 is invariably chosen as the size of the markov bernstein factor to estimate p t in terms of the values of pw on the real line we write t u iv and use an inequality that often arises in the theory of functions analytic in the upper half plane we already used one form of this in the proof of lemma 2 2 log p u iv v log p s s u 2 v 2 ds v logm q s s u 2 v 2 ds logm v q s s u 2 v 2 ds 8 16 where m pw l r of course we need to assume the integral converges which is very restrictive we shall assume more precisely that 0 q t 1 t 2 dt and that for s 1 q s sq s s 2 q s then the above considerations show that log p w x log 1 logm sup v v q s q x s u 2 v 2 ds 8 17 d s lubinsky 54 the technical challenge is to estimate the integral in the last right hand side we break it into several pieces if we assume x 1 0 u 2 x and q x 0 we see that i 1 v 3 u 2 q s q x s u 2 v 2 ds 9 3 u 2 q s s 2 ds and i 2 v 0 q s q x s u 2 v 2 ds 9 0 q s s 2 ds recall that v t x in 0 u 2 we see that the integrand is non positive as s u 2 x so i 3 v u 2 0 q s q x s u 2 v 2 ds 0 finally we handle the difficult central integral i 4 v 3 u 2 u 2 q s q x s u 2 v 2 ds v 3 u 2 u 2 q s q u s u 2 v 2 ds q u q x i 41 i 42 here i 41 v 3 u 2 u 2 q s q u s u 2 v 2 ds v u u 2 q r 2 q u q 2 u r r u 2 v 2 dr for some between r and u q r 2 q u q 2 u r q r u 2 and one can show that 69 p 53 q cq r r 2 so i 41 c 2 u u 2 q r r 2 dr also i 42 q u q x q u x cq x c 2 x x q s s 2 ds combining the above estimates we have shown that for x 1 log p w x log 1 logm c 1 q y y 2 1 dy weighted approximation 55 we simply choose 1 similar estimates hold over 1 and the range 1 1 is easy to handle this leads to the markov inequality p w l r c pw l r valid for all n 1 and polynomials of degree n when dealing with weights w exp q where q grows faster than x some 1 one typically chooses an n uses restricted range inequalities and needs more work to estimate the various integrals 8 5 levin lubinsky s method like the previous method we use cauchy s integral formula for derivatives and then go back to the real line however instead of using 8 16 we use the potential theoretic functions associated with exponential weights these give analogues of the bernstein walsh inequality for growth of polynomials in the complex plane for p going back from the plane to the real line is quite complicated and requires carleson measures we shall outline the method for 1 p fix x 0 0 and define an entire function fx by fx z exp q x q x z x observe that f j x x w j x for j 0 1 we have pw x pfx x 1 2 i t x pfx t t x 2 dt 1 2 t x pfx t p dt 1 p 1 2 t x t x 2 q dt 1 q 1 1 2 pfx p x ei d 1 p 8 18 in the second last line we used ho lder s inequality and q p p 1 there we shall choose n x n x where n x is given by 7 8 this guarantees 85 lemma 10 6 p 301 that fx z cw z for z x n x 8 19 the proof of this involves a taylor series expansion of q re z aboutq x now comes the potential theory bit there is 85 lemma 10 7 p 303 a function gn analytic in c an an with boundary values gn x on an an from the upper half plane satisfying gn x w x x an an d s lubinsky 56 moreover zngn z has a finite limit at and uniformly for x a 2 n a 2 n w z c gn z z x n x 8 20 one representation for gn is gn z exp an an log z t d n t cn where n is the equilibrium measure of mass n for the weight w and cn is an equilibrium constant recall that we used something similar in deriving restricted range inequalities in section 6 then we obtain from 8 18 to 8 20 pn x pw x p c pgn p x n x ei d integrating gives a 2 n a 2 n pn pw p c a 2 n a 2 n pgn p x n x ei d dx c pgn p d n n 8 21 where n is a measure on the upper half plane and n is a measure on the lower half plane for borel measurable sets s with characteristic function s we have n s a 2 n a 2 n 0 s x n x e i d dx n s a 2 n a 2 n 0 s x n x e i d dx next we use a famous inequality of carleson we say a measure on the upper half plane is a carleson measure if there exists a 0 such that for all squares k in the upper half plane with base on the real axis and side h 0 k ah the smallest such number a is called n the carleson norm of let hp denote the hardy space in the upper half plane consisting of all functions analytic there whose boundary values on the real axis lie in lp r for f hp f pd cn f p for p 1 there is an analogous statement applying this to 8 21 gives a 2 n a 2 n pn pw p c n n n n pgn p weighted approximation 57 here although n is a measure on the lower half plane it is obvious what is meant by its carleson norm next one shows that sup n n n n n finally an an pgn p an an pw p and one can show using hilbert transform estimates that x an pgn p c an an pw p giving a 2 n a 2 n n pw p c an an pw p the integral over r a 2 n a 2 n may be handled using restricted range inequalities this method is the deepest of those we presented and it is the only one that gives the bernstein inequalities in theorem 7 4 and 7 6 for p the proof is easier as one can avoid carleson measures 82 133 8 6 sieved markov bernstein inequalities the methods of this section have been extensively developed by paul nevai and others 105 108 and illustrate the power of jensen s inequality on finite intervals they go back at least to zygmund 193 the idea is to start with the christoffel type estimates pw 2 c n an pw 2 8 22 and p w 2 c n an 3 pw 2 8 23 valid for freud weights w n 1 polynomials p of degree n and r we used these already in section 8 1 we now extend these to lp type christoffel function estimates let 0 p 2 from 8 22 we derive pw 2 l r c n an pw 2 p l r pw p and hence pw p l r c n an pw p 8 24 next 8 23 followed by 8 24 give p w 2 l r c n an 3 pw 2 p l r pw p c n an 3 n an pw p 2 p p pw p d s lubinsky 58 rearranging gives p w p l r c n an p 1 pw p 8 25 thus far we have 8 24 and 8 25 for 0 p 2 our weight is w exp q we apply these inequalities instead to the weight exp rq for fixed r 0 its mhaskar rakhmanov saff number is a multiple of that for w exp q since for any fixed s 0 asn an uniformly in n we obtain pw r p l r c n an pw r p 8 26 and p w r p l r c n an p 1 pw r p 8 27 for all 0 p 2 r 0 n 1 and p of degree n now comes the sieving idea let l m be positive integers and fix we apply these inequalities to the polynomial in t p t s t kmn t l 8 28 where s has degree n and kn t n 1 j 0 pj pj t is the nth reproducing kernel for the weight w 2 as lm 1 n a lm 1 n n an uniformly in n we obtain from 8 26 s klmn w r p c n an sw r t kmn t l p dt here for freud weights w f 83 kn 1 n w 2 n an w 2 1 2 an 8 29 while kn 1 n w 2 c n an w 2 r 8 30 so if m is so large that 1 2 amn 2 an we obtain for all polynomials s of degree n and all 2 an s pw r 2 l p c n an 1 lp sw r t kmn t l p dt weighted approximation 59 now assume that l is chosen so large that lp 2 by cauchy schwarz for all n and t r kmn t lp 2 kmn 1 2 kmn t t 1 2 lp 2 c n an lp 2 w 1 w 1 t lp 2 8 31 so s pw r l p 2 can n s t pkmn t 2 w r l p 2 t dt 8 32 we now choose r l 1 giving sw p can n sw t p w w t kmn t 2 dt 8 33 valid for all 0 p 2 n 1 s of degree n and 2 an since by orthonormality k 2 mn t w t 2 dt kmn n an w 2 8 34 we can also write this as lemma 8 2 let 0 p 2 n 1 s of degree n and 2 an then sw p c sw t pkmn t 2 w 2 t dt kmn t 2 w 2 t dt 8 35 from this follows lemma 8 3 fundamental lemma of sieving let 0 0 be a convex increasing function of x with 0 0 let p 0 n 1 s of degree n and 2 an then sw p c sw p t kmn t 2 w 2 t dt kmn t 2 w 2 t dt 8 36 if in addition for some a 0 2 t a t t 0 then sw p c sw p t kmn t 2 w 2 t dt kmn t 2 w 2 t dt 8 37 proof for p 2 this follows from 8 35 by a single application of jensen s inequality for general p one instead applies jensen s inequality with the convex function t 7 ta with large enough a d s lubinsky 60 next we extend this to derivatives we again use the polynomial p of 8 28 we let k n x t x kn x t by 8 25 s klmn l kmn l 1 k mn s p w rp c n an p 1 sw r t kmn t l p dt here we recall 8 29 and 8 30 while cauchy schwarz and 8 2 give for all x t r k mn t mn 1 k 0 p k 2 1 2 mn 1 k 0 pk t 2 1 2 c n an 2 w 1 w 1 t then s pw r l p 2 c n an p s pw r l p 2 c n an p 1 s t pkmn t 2 w r l p 2 t dt c n an p 1 s t pkmn t 2 w r l p 2 t dt by 8 32 we now choose r l 1 giving s w p c n an p 1 sw p t w w t kmn t 2 dt 8 38 which we can reformulate as lemma 8 4 let 0 p 2 n 1 s of degree n and 2 an then s w p c n an p sw p t kmn t 2 w 2 t dt kmn t 2 w 2 t dt 8 39 from this follows lemma 8 5 let 0 0 be a convex increasing function of x with 0 0 let p 0 n 1 s of degree n and 2 an then s w p c nansw p t kmn t 2 w 2 t dt kmn t 2 w 2 t dt 8 40 if in addition for some a 0 2 t a t t 0 8 41 then s w p c nansw p t kmn t 2 w 2 t dt kmn t 2 w 2 t dt 8 42 weighted approximation 61 proof the proof uses jensen s inequality as in lemma 8 3 the inequalities 8 40 and 8 42 are useful for more than markov bernstein inequalities but for the moment we deduce by integration and restricted range inequalities 108 theorem 8 6 let w f let 0 0 be a convex increasing function of x with 0 0 let p 0 n 1 s of degree n then s w p d c n an sw p t dt 8 43 if in addition for some a 0 8 41 holds then s w p d c n an sw p t dt 8 44 9 nikolskii inequalities we already proved an inequality of this type in the last section pw l r c n an 1 p pw lp r for n 1 and polynomials p of degree n recall 8 24 and 8 35 thus we compared the weighted sup norm and weighted lp norm of a polynomial more generally inequalities that com pare the norms of polynomials of degree n in different spaces are called nikolskii inequalities they are not difficult to prove here is a sample theorem 9 1 let w f let 0 p r then for n 1 and polynomials p of degree n pw lp r cnn p r pw lr r where nn p r a 1 p 1 r n r p n an 1 r 1 p r p proof if first r p we can use restricted range inequalities and then ho lder s inequality pw p lp r c an an pw p c an an pw p r p p r an an 1 1 p r c pw p lr r a 1 p r n that is pw lp r ca 1 p 1 r n pw lr r if p the proof is easier next if r p we use pw p lp r pw p pw p r l r pw r d s lubinsky 62 letting n p sup deg p n pw l r pw lp r p we obtain pw lp r 1 r 1 p n p pw plr r 9 1 in the case of freud weights w f that grow at least as fast as x some 1 we know from 8 24 that n p c n an for the canonical weights w we have n p n 1 1 1 log n 1 1 1 1 the sharpness of these was proved by nevai and totik 143 152 observe that n p grows independently of p in general it seems that n p sup x r 1 n w 2 x w 2 x for general convex exponential weights it is known 85 p 295 that theorem 9 2 let w feven c 2 be as in definition 7 5 let 0 p r then for n 1 and polynomials p of degree n pw lp r cnn p r pw lr r where nn p r a 1 p 1 r n r p nt an 1 2 an 1 r 1 p r p 10 orthogonal expansions there is an old mathematical saying that l 1 l 2 and l were invented by the almighty and man invented all else the author heard this many years ago but was interested to see it used as the opening quote in a chapter of simon s treatise 172 that orthogonal expansions naturally live in l 2 is obvious among the many manifestations of this is the best approximation property f sn f w l 2 r en f w 2 infdeg p n f p w l 2 r this ensures that when the polynomials are dense in an obvious sense lim n f sn f w l 2 r 0 weighted approximation 63 for all functions f for which fw l 2 r but it is part of the mathematician s spirit to take important tools out of their natural domain so it is not surprising that much effort has been devoted to convergence of sn f in lp or in a uniform sense or at a specific point and so on a lot of fundamental advances have ensued for example the boundedness of the hilbert transform in lp 1 p was established in order to prove that classic fourier series converge in such lp the theory of ap weights started with muckenhoupt s efforts to prove convergence in lp of hermite expansions in this section we shall discuss pointwise and mean convergence we begin with the latter 10 1 mean convergence recall the reproducing kernel and the christoffel darboux formula kn x t n 1 j 0 pj x pj t n 1 n pn x pn 1 t pn 1 x pn t x t define the hilbert transform h g x g t x t dt lim 0 x x g t x t dt whenever the limit exists if g l 1 r the transform exists for a e x for a function f with fw l 2 r we see that sn f x kn x t f t w 2 t dt n 1 n pn x h pn 1 fw 2 x pn 1 x h pnfw 2 x thus if u is a given function and 1 p sn f wu 2 lp r n 1 n pnwu l r h pn 1 fw 2 u lp r pn 1 wu l r h pnfw 2 u lp r 10 1 next we use the aforementioned theorem of riesz that the hilbert transform is a bounded operator on lp provided 1 p for some c 6 c g h g lp r c g lp r in his investigations of hermite expansions muckenhoupt 144 considered weighted versions for suitable functions u h g u lp r c gu lp r such u are severely restricted in particular satisfying muckenhoupt s condition examples are u t 1 t a 1 p a 1 1 p 10 2 d s lubinsky 64 the theorem fails if p 1 or p though in l 1 other inequalities are available so we continue 10 1 as sn f wu 2 lp r c n 1 n pnwu l r pn 1 fw 2 u lp r pn 1 wu l r pnfw 2 u lp r 10 3 for exponential weights in the real line recall from 4 14 that n 1 n can if we have the bounds pnwu l r ca 1 2 n 10 4 then for some c 6 c n f sn f wu 2 lp r c fw lp r once we have such a bound the reproducing property of sn that sn p p when p has degree n and density of polynomials gives lim n f sn f wu 2 lp r 0 all that is required of f is that fw lp r the problem with this procedure is that the bound 10 4 is hardly ever true for freud weights like w or the weights in the class f we typically have pn x w x ca 1 2 n 1 x an n 2 3 1 4 x r 10 5 and the upper bound reflects the real growth of pn near an pnw l r a 1 2 n n 1 6 however at least in an an with 0 1 fixed we do have pnw ca 1 2 n 10 6 this problematic growth of the orthogonal polynomials near the effective endpoints of the interval of orthogonality already occurs for the legendre weight on 1 1 and more generally jacobi weights the same pollard that solved bernstein s approximation problem came up with a fix for this in the context of freud weights a similar feature occurs for jacobi weights the fix is based on the observation that pn pn 2 has a much better bound than pn pn x pn 2 x w x ca 1 2 n 1 x an n 2 3 1 4 x r 10 7 in particular pn x pn 2 x w x ca 1 2 n x r weighted approximation 65 think of p n cos cosn to see from whence this comes pollard 158 159 160 found a clever way to rewrite the christoffel darboux formula to exploit this let us set n n 1 n then see 90 or 141 for an accessible proof kn x y kn 1 x y kn 2 x y kn 3 x y where kn 1 x y n n n 1 pn 1 x pn 1 y kn 2 x y n n 1 n n 1 pn 1 y pn x pn 2 x x y kn 3 x y kn 2 y x note that there is no x y in the denominator in kn 1 while in kn 2 and kn 3 we have the term pn pn 2 to help this clever decomposition is not enough on its own we emphasize that in investigating mean convergence one still has to break up integrals into several different pieces and work over several different ranges for the hermite weight the simplest bound is due to askey and wainger 2 theorem 10 1 let w x exp x 2 let 4 3 p 4 there exists c 6 c n f such that sn f w lp r c fw lp r this inequality is not true for p 4 3 or p 4 muckenhoupt found the correct extension to 1 p in what follows we let ua x 1 x a theorem 10 2 let w x exp x 2 and 1 p let b 1 1 p b 1 p b b 10 8 assume in addition that b max b 1 p 4 3 p 1 0 if p 4 3 10 9 and b min b 1 1 p 1 3 4 3 p 0 if p 4 10 10 then sn f wub lp r c fwub lp r 10 11 for some c 6 c n f if b b and p 4 3 or 4 then we insert a factor of log x 2 in the right hand side of 10 11 in the case of equality in 10 9 or 10 10 we need strict inequality and replace the max or min by their second terms all these inequalities are also necessary d s lubinsky 66 for general freud weights shing wu jha and the author 52 extended muckenhoupt s result also closing up slight gaps between the latter s necessary and sufficient conditions in boundary cases we let l n log n 1 if 1 otherwise theorem 10 3 let w exp q f let 1 p and b b r a then for sn f wub lp r c fwub lp r to hold with some c 6 c n f it is necessary that i 10 8 holds ii if p 4 3 then a max n b 1 p o b n n 1 6 4 p 3 o 1 lb 1 p n iii if p 4 3 or p 4 then strict inequality holds in the third inequality in 10 8 iv if p 4 then a b min n b 1 1 p o b n n 1 6 1 4 p o 1 lb 1 1 p n b assume in addition that the orthonormal polynomials for w 2 also satisfy 10 7 then the conditions above are also sufficient when w w and an cn 1 the conditions above reduce to essentially muckenhoupt s max b 1 p b 6 4 p 3 0 b 6 1 p 0 b 1 p b min b 1 1 p b 6 1 4 p 0 b 6 1 1 p 0 b 1 1 p the bound 10 7 was established for exp x 2 m m 1 2 3 in 52 for general 1 it follows from results in that paper and work of kriecherbauer and mclaughlin 68 it is an interesting unsolved problem to establish the bound 10 7 for w f or to come up with some method to prove it that works without much deeper tools see 76 for some work in this direction there is also an l 1 analogue of these 52 p 337 further work on mean convergence of orthogonal expansions appears in 56 77 123 130 131 discrete analogues of orthogonal expansions have been considered by mashele 112 113 weighted approximation 67 10 2 uniform and pointwise convergence one of the simplest and yet most elegant and general theorems on pointwise convergence is an extension of the dirichlet jordan criterion due to freud 39 it was subsequently extended by mhaskar 129 131 its proof is quite simple and follows readily from estimates of previous sections so we provide it theorem 10 4 dirichlet jordan criterion let w f and let f r r be absolutely continuous with f w l 1 r then lim n f sn f w l r 0 proof note first that fw is bounded and has limit 0 at to see this let a 0 and x a then fw x f a x a f w x f a w x a f w as w is decreasing hence lim sup x fw x a f w our integrability condition on f w ensures that this last right hand side can be made as small as we please so indeed fw has limit 0 at next let m n 2 then f sn f w l r f vm f w l r vm f sn f w l r 10 12 here by nikolskii inequalities such as in theorem 9 1 vm f sn f w l r c n an vm f sn f w l 2 r c n an vm f f w l 2 r f sn f w l 2 r 2 c n an vm f f w l 2 r 10 13 recall the l 2 best approximation property of the partial sums sn and that vm has degree 2 m n next vm f f w 2 l 2 r vm f f w l 1 r vm f f w l r cem f w 1 vm f f w l r c am m f w l 1 r vm f f w l r d s lubinsky 68 we used the jackson favard inequality 4 5 in the last line since m n so am m an n by substituting this into 10 13 we obtain vm f sn f w l r c f w l 1 r vm f f w l r 1 2 so 10 12 becomes f sn f w l r f vm f w l r c f w l 1 r vm f f w l r 1 2 c 1 em f w em f w 1 2 by theorem 4 8 again since fw is continuous and has limit 0 at infinity we have em f w 0 as n this theorem is attractive because of the simplicity of the hypotheses we don t need to assume anything about the tail of f there are also results which give convergence at a point under local assumptions a result of mhaskar 136 p 224 is the archetype theorem 10 5 let w f and in addition assume that q is increasing on 0 let f be of bounded variation and x be a point of continuity of f then sn f x f x c x x an n x an n w df an n w df t can w df here c x depends on x but not on n or f mashele 114 has established analogues of this for general exponential weights unfortunately in passing to the more general weights some of the power of this result is lost ky 77 has investigated a e convergence of orthonormal expansions for freud weights trilinear kernels and related expansions have been explored by osilenker 154 there is an extensive literature on expansions in hermite polynomials including transplantation theorems 186 187 that specifically exploit the structure of the hermite weight there are also many results for laguerre and related expansions on the interval 0 see 119 11 lagrange interpolation lagrange interpolation at zeros of orthogonal polynomials is probably the most studied of all approximation processes associated with exponential weights recall that we denoted the zeros of pn the nth orthonormal polynomial for the weight w 2 by xnn xn 1 n x 2 n x 1 n given a function f we define the nth lagrange interpolation polynomial to f at xjn nj 1 to be the unique polynomial of degree n 1 that satisfies ln f xjn f xjn 1 j n weighted approximation 69 one formula for ln f is ln f n j 1 f xjn jn where jn nj 1 are fundamental polynomials of lagrange interpolation satisfying jn xkn jk the jn admit the representation jn x n k 1 k 6 j x xkn xjn xkn but because we are using zeros of orthogonal polynomials there are others jn x kn x xjn kn xjn xjn to see this look at the christoffel darboux formula another advantage of interpolating at zeros of orthogonal polynomials is the ease of analysis largely because we have the gauss quadrature formula for polynomials p of degree 2 n 1 pw 2 n j 1 jnp xjn where jn n w 2 xjn 1 kn xjn xjn are called the christoffel numbers since ln f 2 has degree 2 n 2 and agrees with f at xjn we see that ln f 2 w 2 n j 1 jnf 2 xjn 11 1 thus boundedness and convergence of ln f is closely associated with convergence of gauss quadrature there are at least two recent monographs devoted to lagrange interpolation 116 179 11 1 mean convergence just as sn f converge in l 2 so do the ln f a famous theorem of erdo s tura n indeed we may think of ln f as a discretization of sn f ln f x n j 1 jnf xjn kn x xjn w 2 t f t kn x t dt sn f x at this stage may i share two erdo s stories with the reader i was doing a postdoc at the technion in haifa in 1982 erdo s often visited the technion and i was one of several who went to lunch with him later that day i carried his suit to the drycleaners and the reward was some time d s lubinsky 70 with him he asked me what i was doing and i mentioned numerical quadrature he replied that i should go and read the book of freud on orthogonal polynomials which i did and it changed my career here is another story which illustrates how little we communicate across fields in early 2006 i had the privilege of visiting texas a m in college station to give some frontiers lectures i mentioned the famous theorem of erdo s tura n on distribution of zeros of polynomials at the end of the talk one of the very first comments was i thought erdo s was a graph theorist hmmph he spent a large amount of his life on lagrange interpolation orthogonal polynomials and approximation theory since lagrange interpolation samples a function only at a discrete sets of points and sets of measure zero make no difference to lebesgue integrals it is clear that we shall need to use something other than lebesgue integrability as gauss quadrature sums are riemann sums or riemann stieltjes sums 181 p 50 the riemann integral is the appropriate tool the following result was actually proved by shohat 171 erdo s tura n considered only finite intervals the growth of f at poses extra problems for the infinite interval theorem 11 1 shohat s version of the erdo s tura n theorem let f be bounded and riemann integrable on each finite interval assume moreover that there is an even entire function g with all non negative maclaurin series coefficients such that gw 2 is integrable over the real line and lim x f 2 x g x 0 11 2 then lim n f ln f 2 w 2 0 11 3 proof let p be a fixed polynomial for large enough n ln p p so f ln f 2 w 2 f p ln f p 2 w 2 2 f p 2 w 2 2 ln f p 2 w 2 2 f p 2 w 2 n j 1 jn f p 2 xjn 11 4 in the second last line we used the inequality x y 2 2 x 2 y 2 and in the last line we used 11 1 now if g is not a polynomial which we may assume just add a very slowly growing entire function if it is lim x f p 2 x g x 0 let 0 choose a 0 such that x a f p 2 x g x weighted approximation 71 then j xjn a jn f p 2 xjn j xjn a jng xjn n j 1 jng xjn gw 2 by a special case of the posse markov stieltjes inequalities 38 p 92 these inequalities estimate quadrature sums of absolutely monotone functions in terms of integrals next since f p 2 a a is riemann integrable while gauss quadrature sums are riemann sums lim n j xjn a jn f p 2 xjn a a f p 2 w 2 substituting all these in 11 4 gives lim sup n f ln f 2 w 2 4 f p 2 w 2 gw 2 here p is independent of and by l 2 analogues of the bernstein problem may be chosen so that f p 2 w 2 is as small as we please note that if f is of polynomial growth at we can always choose g to satisfy 11 2 for large classes of exponential weights the author 87 88 constructed entire functions g satisfying the hypotheses above and with g x w 2 x 1 x a any a 1 so typically the growth restriction on f is hardly more than that required for fw 2 to be integrable of course this is a really beautiful result and its proof is elegant the extensions to lp require a whole lot more work but like their cousins in orthogonal expansions a lot of great mathematics has come out of these efforts it was paul nevai 149 who obtained the first major result in lp for the hermite weight theorem 11 2 let f be continuous on the real line let w x exp 1 2 x 2 be the hermite weight and assume that lim x f x 1 x w x 0 let ln f denote the lagrange interpolation polynomials to f at the zeros of hermite polyno mials then for p 1 lim n f ln f w lp r 0 note that the pth power of the weight w appears in the integral nevai showed that the presence of such a factor is necessary see his still relevant survey for more perspectives on this 147 the author and d matjila 106 subsequently extended nevai s result to general freud weights theorem 11 3 let f be continuous on the real line let 1 p 1 and w x exp 1 2 x let r 0 and min 1 moreover let p 1 p 6 max 0 1 4 p 11 5 d s lubinsky 72 let ln f denote the lagrange interpolation polynomials to f at the zeros of pn w 2 x for lim n

hold for every 1 p and every continuous f satisfying 11 7 it is necessary and sufficient that max 1 6 this in turn is a special case of a result for general freud weights theorem 11 4 let w exp q f let p 1 r 0 and min 1 let ln f denote the lagrange interpolation polynomials to f at the zeros of pn w 2 x for 11 6 to hold for every continuous function satisfying 11 7 it is necessary and sufficient that 1 p if 1 p 4 a 1 p n n 1 6 1 4 p o 1 log n if p 4 and 1 a 1 p n n 1 6 1 4 p o 1 if p 4 and 6 1 11 8 the main ideas of proof of these results already appear in nevai s 1980 paper although obvi ously technical details are more complicated for general weights in analyzing ln f one fixes a polynomial p and splits the function f p into two pieces for example ln f p ln f p 14 an 14 an ln f p r 14 an 1 4 an and handles them separately using different techniques one of the reasons for the split is the bound pn x w x ca 1 2 n x 1 an any fixed 0 which does not extend all the way to an recall the discussion at 10 5 and 10 6 indeed it is the fact that pn x w x behaves roughly like 1 x an 1 4 near an that accounts for the change in phenomena at p 4 as well as for the complicated conditions the weighted lp norms of the two pieces of f are themselves split into a number of pieces with different techniques used to estimate over different ranges tools include estimates of quadrature sums in terms of integrals see section 12 bounds on hilbert transforms and estimates of special quadrature sums here we shall establish just one of the main estimates using ideas that go back to richard askey

of 11 12 we use duality but in a very precise form let gn x sign ln n x ln n x p 1 w p 2 x 1 x p 12 an 12 an x then ln n x w x 1 x p lp 12 an 1 2 an ln n gn x w 2 x dx ln n sn gn x w 2 x dx 11 14 by orthogonality of g sn g to polynomials of degree n 1 using the gauss quadrature formula and the interpolatory properties of n we continue this as n k 1 kn n xkn sn g xkn xkn 14 an kn sn g xkn w 1 xkn

106 mean convergence of lagrange interpolation associated with erdo s weights has been investigated by s damelin and the author 25 26 the author has investigated lagrange interpolation associated with exponential weights on 1 1 94 while d kubayi and the author investigated mean convergence associated with general exponential weights 75 the convergence in lp p 1 has been investigated by matjila 125 one obvious question is whether other interpolation sets lead to cleaner or simpler results it was j szabados 176 192 who came up with this idea the method of additional points in the context of lebesgue functions which we shall discuss shortly szabados idea was to add two extra points of interpolation near an to damp the growth of pn x recall roughly 1 x an 1 4 near an suitable points are those where pnw attains its sup norm on the real line pnw n pnw l r d s lubinsky 76 one can show that 1 n an cn 2 3 and that x 1 n n an n 2 3 we let l n f denote the polynomial of degree n 1 that interpolates to f at the n 2 points n xnn xn 1 n x 2 n x 1 n n inspired by szabados work on lebesgue functions g mastroianni and the author 103 proved theorem 11 6 let w f let p 1 r 0 and min 1 for lim n f l n f x w x 1 x p lp r 0 11 18 to hold for every continuous function satisfying lim x f x 1 x w x 0 11 19 it is necessary and sufficient that 1 p what a difference the extra two points make let us explain a little of the mechanics behind this l n f admits the representation l n f x f n 0 n x f n n 1 n x n j 1 f xjn j n x where for 1 j n j n x jn x 2 n x 2 2 n x 2 jn and jn x pn x p n xjn x xjn the factor 2 n x 2 damps the growth of pn x near an of course there is an extra factor of 2 n x 2 jn in the denominator but this is large for most xjn so actually helps we already noted that convergence of ln f associated with freud weights in lp p 1 has been investigated by matjila 125 if one sacrifices precision in this case one can achieve very general results using distribution functions rearrangements of functions and a classic lemma of loomis 3 the latter asserts that for any cj nj 1 meas x n j 1 cj x xj 8 n j 1 cj weighted approximation 77 it is often stated in the case where all cj 0 and without absolute values if one writes ln f x pn x n j 1 f xjn p n xjn x xjn pn x gn x we see that for any positive function and real numbers b c ln f w b lp r pnw b c l 2 p r gn c l 2 p r 11 20 next loomis lemma shows that mgn meas x gn x 8 fw c l r n j 1 1 p nw c xjn 8 fw c l r n for the moment let h denote the decreasing rearrangement of a function h in particular the decreasing rearrangement of gn is g n t sup mgn t sup 8 fw c l r n t 8 fw c l r t n inequalities for decreasing rearrangements give 3 gn c 2 p l 2 p r gn c 2 p 0 gn 2 p 2 pc 0 g n 2 p 1 2 pc 8 fw c l r n 2 p 0 t 2 p 1 t 2 pc dt 11 21 now if p 1 2 this integrand poses no problem at 0 if for example t 1 t then 1 t 1 t 2 1 t 0 and the integral will converge provided 2 p 2 pc 1 combining this 11 20 and 11 21 we obtain ln f w b lp r c fw c l r n pnw b c l 2 p r with c independent of n f recalling the definition of n above we have the main part of 97 theorem 3 p 155 theorem 11 7 let w be even and positive in 0 and t 1 t the following are equivalent i there exist b c r and c p 0 such that for every continuous f ln f w b lp r c fw c l r d s lubinsky 78 ii there exist r and r 0 such that sup n 1 pnw lr r n j 1 1 p nw xjn from this one may easily obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for mean convergence of ln f in lp some p 12 with appropriate weights the striking feature of these results is the simplicity of the proofs and their generality however one sacrifices a great deal of precision for even the specific lp is not fixed in advance for further work on mean convergence of lagrange interpolation associated with exponential weights see 19 21 24 53 117 118 123 153 168 169 11 2 lebesgue functions and pointwise convergence since ln p p for any polynomial p of degree n 1 the convergence of ln in almost any norm is equivalent to the norms of these operators being bounded independent of n the lebesgue function is the weighted norm of ln f at a given point when working on infinite intervals it makes more sense to investigate weighted version of these the idea is ln f x w x n j 1 f xjn jn x w x fw l r w x n j 1 jn x w 1 xjn fw l r n x it is easy to see by suitable choice of f that n x sup ln f x w x fw l r 1 so the lebesgue function n x is indeed a norm the lebesgue constant of ln is n n l r observe that for any function f there is the pointwise error estimate w x f ln f x 1 n x inf deg p n 1 f p w l r 1 n x en f w and hence the global estimate w f ln f l r 1 n en f w amongst the contributors to estimation of n x on infinite intervals are damelin freud horva th kubayi matjila nevai sklyarov szabados szabo szili and ve rtesi the earliest results were due to freud and sklyarov the following result for general freud weights is due to szabados 176 indeed it was in this context that szabados introduced his method of additional points matjila 124 126 independently obtained the upper bound implicit in a weighted approximation 79 theorem 11 8 let w exp q f a let n denote the lebesgue constant for the lagrange interpolation polynomials ln at the zeros of pn w 2 then n n 1 6 n 1 b let n denote the lebesgue constant for the lagrange interpolation polynomials l n at the zeros of pn w 2 together with the points n where pnw attains its maximum then n log n 1 n 1 the n 1 6 arises from the factor 1 x an 1 4 that gives the growth of pn near an together with the fact that 1 x 1 n an n 2 3 it is remarkable that szabados addition of the two points n gives the optimal factor of log n yes that is the same lower bound of log n for the sup norm of projection operators onto the space of polynomials of degree n in the context of finite intervals 179 in the context of exponential weights this optimality was proved by szabados 176 there are extensions of this result to erdo s weights and exponential weights on 1 1 12 13 71 73 74 typically there one obtains the same result for n while n nt an 1 6 n 1 some inkling of the proofs comes from the representation for the fundamental polynomials jn x jnkn x xjn when we interpolate at the zeros of pn then n x w x n j 1 jn x w 1 xjn w x n j 1 jnw 1 xjn kn x xjn w x w t kn x t dt recall that jn ann w 2 xjn at least for xjn well inside the interval an an for general sets of interpolation nodes lower bounds for lebesgue functions have been obtained by ve rtesi and his coworkers 189 190 these show that most of the time the lebesgue function is bounded below by log n 190 p 359 theorem 11 9 let w f for n 1 let n x denote the lebesgue function corresponding to n distinct points not necessarily the zeros of pn let 0 then there is a set hn of linear lebesgue measure 2 an such that n x c log n x an an hn the constant is independent of n x and the array of interpolation points d s lubinsky 80 szabados analyzed the influence of the distribution of the interpolation points and in particular the largest interpolation point on the size of the fundamental polynomials and lebesgue constant 177 kubayi 72 and damelin 17 explored szabados result in the context of more general weights summability of weighted lagrange interpolation has been investigated by szili and ve rtesi 183 184 185 when one increases the degree of the polynomial interpolating at n points from n 1 to n 1 some fixed 0 then one can avoid the factor of log n above for finite intervals this was an old result of erdo s for freud weights it is due to ve rtesi 191 and for exponential weights on 1 1 due to szili and ve rtesi 182 theorem 11 10 let w f let us be given an array of interpolation points xjn n 1 1 j n with associated fundamental polynomials of interpolation jn n 1 1 j n assume that these admit the bound sup x r jn x w 1 xjn w x a for n 1 and 1 j n let 0 and let f be a continuous function such that fw 1 has limit 0 at then there exist polynomials pn such that i pn has degree nn n 1 c n 2 3 ii pn xjn f xjn 1 j n iii w 1 f pn l r cenn f w 1 note that the fundamental polynomials associated with the orthogonal polynomials pn w 2 x satisfy the above bound 83 despite the many investigations of lagrange interpolation there are relatively few results where local assumptions are imposed that guarantee pointwise convergence of ln f it seems that the following interesting result of nevai has never been extended beyond the case of the hermite weight 146 theorem 11 11 let w x exp x 2 let f be riemann integrable in each finite interval and assume that for some c 1 2 fw c l r assume that on a b f satisfies the one sided dini condition f x t f x v t log t 1 a x x t b where v t decreases to 0 as t decreases to 0 then lim n ln f x f x 11 22 at each point of continuity of f in a b the convergence is uniform in every closed subinterval of a b where f is continuous note that any increasing function f satisfies this dini condition so 11 22 holds also when f is of bounded variation in a b for then f is the difference of monotone increasing functions finally we note that convergence of lagrange interpolation to entire functions of suitably restricted growth leads to a geometric rate of convergence see 136 weighted approximation 81 12 marcinkiewicz zygmund inequalities the classical marcinkiewicz zygmund inequality has the form c 1 1 2 r p d 1 p 1 2 n 1 2 n j 0 r j 2 n 1 p c 2 where n 1 r is a trigonometric polynomial of degree n and c 1 and c 2 are independent of n and r 193 vol 2 p 28 these types of inequalities are useful for example in discretisation problems quadrature theory and lagrange interpolation in the context of exponential weights these have chiefly been used for mean convergence of lagrange interpolation in fact the proof of the erdo s tura n theorem above was based on a converse quadrature sum namely ln f 2 w 2 n j 1 jnf 2 xjn this of course is an immediate consequence of the gauss quadrature formula in our outline of the proof of lemma 11 5 above we used a forward quadrature sum let us repeat this in simplified form assume that we have an inequality n j 1 jnw 2 xjn pw xjn c pw 12 1 if q p p 1 duality gives ln f w lp r sup g ln f gw 2 where the sup is taken over all g with gw lq r 1 using orthogonality of g sn g to polynomials of degree n 1 and then the gauss quadrature formula gives sup g ln f sn g w 2 sup g n j 1 jnf xjn sn g xjn fw l r n j 1 jnw 2 xjn sn g xjn w xjn c fw l r sn g w in the last line we used the quadrature sum estimate 12 1 setting n sign sn g and then using self adjointness of sn we continue the above as c fw l r nw 1 sn g w 2 c fw l r sn nw 1 gw 2 c fw l r sn nw 1 w lp r d s lubinsky 82 if sn is bounded in a suitable sense we obtain ln f w lp r c fw l r with c independent of n we emphasize that this is a simplified version of what one needs typically there are extra factors inside the quadrature sum in subsequent sections we shall present several methods to establish such quadrature sums 12 1 nevai s method for forward quadrature sums we let u xjn xj 1 n p 1 and start with the following consequence of the fundamental theorem of calculus pw p xjn pw p u p xj 1 n u pw p 1 s pw s ds we may assume that u is the point in xjn xj 1 n where pw p attains its minimum we now need estimates for christoffel functions and spacing of zeros of orthogonal polynomials in fact the former imply the latter via markov stieltjes inequalities we use jnw 2 xjn n w 2 xjn w 2 xjn n xjn where n is defined by 7 8 and xjn xj 1 n c jnw 2 xjn then jnw 2 xjn pw p xjn c xj 1 n xjn pw p u du c n xjn xj 1 n xjn pw p 1 s pw s ds summing over j and using the fact that n does not change much in xjn xj 1 n one obtains n j 1 jnw 2 xjn pw p xjn c pw p u du c pw p 1 s pw s n s ds 12 2 we apply ho lder s inequality and then the bernstein inequality theorem 7 6 to the second term pw p 1 s pw s n s ds pw p 1 lp r pw n lp r c pw p 1 lp r pw lp r together with 12 2 this gives n j 1 jnw 2 xjn pw p xjn c pw plp r 12 3 here is a sample of what can be proved using this method 107 thm 2 p 287 weighted approximation 83 theorem 12 1 let w f 1 p b 2 and a r then n j 1 jnw b xjn 1 xjn a pw p xjn c pw p t 1 t aw 2 b t dt this method has also been used by h ko nig in a vector valued and banach space setting with w as the hermite weight 65 66 it was used first for hermite weights by nevai 149 of course it can be used for points other than zeros of orthogonal polynomials all we need are suitable estimates on the spacing between successive zeros 12 2 the large sieve method as far as the author is aware this also was developed by p nevai based on the large sieve of number theory and used by him and his coworkers for exponential weights 105 we already presented the idea in the context of markov bernstein inequalities in section 8 6 we start with lemma 8 3 for polynomials s of degree n sw p c sw p t kmn t 2 w 2 t dt kmn t 2 w 2 t dt which is equivalent to sw p c mn sw p t kmn t 2 w 2 t dt here p 0 s is a polynomial of degree n and 2 an while m is a fixed large enough positive integer independent of n p we now simply take linear combinations of this and use the bound mn w 2 c an n w 2 2 an for example if we use the zeros of pn we obtain n j 1 sw p xjn c sw p t n t dt where n t an n w 2 t n j 1 k 2 mn xjn t w 2 xjn here by the christoffel darboux formula and our bounds for pn and recalling our bound 8 31 for kmn we see that for t 2 an w w t kmn t min n an 1 t moreover for freud weights uniformly in j n xjn xj 1 n c an n d s lubinsky 84 hence n t c n j 1 xjn xj 1 n min an n xjn t 2 c min an n u t 2 du c 1 n an thus we arrive at the estimate n j 1 an n sw p xjn c sw p t dt valid for n 1 and polynomials p of degree n we note that this does not imply the estimate n j 1 jnw 2 xjn sw p xjn c sw p t dt since jnw 2 xjn an n 1 xjn an n 2 3 1 2 an n when xjn is close to an thus this method is in some respects not as powerful as nevai s method however it can easily yield estimates like n j 1 an n sw p xjn c sw p t dt where is an increasing convex function that is positive in 0 and has 0 0 and works for any set of suitably spaced points 12 3 the duality method the idea here is to use duality of lp spaces to derive a forward quadrature sum estimate from a converse one it was probably first used by ko nig 65 66 let us illustrate this in the context of quadrature sums at zeros of orthogonal polynomials let n be fixed and n be a pure jump measure having mass jnw 2 xjn at xjn let as usual q p p 1 if p is a polynomial of degree n n j 1 jnw 2 xjn pw p xjn 1 p pw pd n 1 p sup g pw 2 g d n where the sup is taken over all g with gw q d n 1 since g needs to be defined only at xjn nj 1 we can assume that g is a polynomial of degree n 1 so pw 2 g d n n j 1 jn pg xjn pgw 2 pw lp r gw lq r weighted approximation 85 now we assume a suitable converse quadrature sum inequality for n 1 and all s of degree n sw lq r c n j 1 jnw 2 xjn sw q xjn 1 q 12 4 applying this to g gives gw lq r c n j 1 jnw 2 xjn gw q xjn 1 q c gw qd n 1 q c thus we obtain n j 1 jnw 2 xjn sw p xjn 1 p c pw lp r in ko nig s work he first proved a converse inequality like 12 4 for 1 q 4 and then deduced a forward estimate for 4 3 p note that one can also use carleson measures to derive forward quadrature estimates just as we derived markov bernstein inequalities in section 8 5 for this approach on finite intervals see the survey 95 12 4 the duality method for converse quadrature sum estimates this was perhaps the earliest method used for converse quadrature sum estimates for trigono metric polynomials it appears in zygmund s treatise 193 ch x pp 28 29 let 1 p and q p p 1 let p be a polynomial of degree n 1 by duality pw lp r sup g gpw 2 where the sup is taken over all g with gw lq r 1 let sn g denote the nth partial sum of the orthonormal expansion of g with respect to pj j 0 by orthogonality we continue this as pw lp r sup g sn g pw 2 using the gauss quadrature formula and then ho lder s inequality we continue this as sup g n j 1 jnsn g xjn p xjn sup g n j 1 jnw 2 xjn sn g w q xjn 1 q n j 1 jnw 2 xjn pw p xjn 1 p sup g t 1 t 2 d s lubinsky 86 if we have a suitable forward quadrature sum estimate and mean boundedness of sn in a weighted lq norm we can bound t 1 as follows t 1 c sn g w lq r c gw lq r c then for n 1 and all polynomials p of degree n pw lp r c n j 1 jnw 2 xjn pw p xjn 1 p this method does yield estimates for full gauss quadrature sums however it requires mean boundedness of orthogonal expansions such as that in theorem 10 3 which is difficult to prove it also requires a forward quadrature sum estimate which is not all that difficult to prove it works best for p 4 for p 4 the next method gives better results here is a sample of what one can achieve 91 thm 1 2 p 531 we note that because we are considering a special case of results there the hypotheses there are simplified below theorem 12 2 let w f and assume that the orthonormal polynomials pn for w 2 satisfy the bound 10 7 let p 4 and r r r satisfy r 1 p 12 5 and a r min n r 1 1 p o n n 1 6 1 4 p o 1 r 6 1 1 p o log n r r 1 1 p 12 6 then for n 1 and polynomials p of degree n 1 pw x 1 x r lp r c n j 1 jnw 2 xjn pw p xjn 1 xjn rp 1 p 12 7 for p 4 this persists provided 12 5 holds and r min r 1 1 p 0 weights that satisfy the bound 10 7 include exp x 1 in 91 we showed that slightly weaker forms of these conditions on r r are necessary 12 5 ko nig s method ko nig s method 65 66 is based on a clever estimate for hilbert transforms of characteristic functions of intervals it is technically the most difficult of all the methods we present for forward or converse estimates but is very powerful and relatively direct it does not depend on mean boundedness of orthogonal expansions for n 1 and 1 j n let ijn xjn xj 1 n ijn xj 1 n xj n jn ijn weighted approximation 87 let p be a polynomial of degree

exponential weights see 18 23 96 in particular in the latter paper an attempt was made to provide a very general framework for ko nig s method 13 hermite and hermite fe jer interpolation the hermite interpolation polynomial to a function f at the zeros xjn nj 1 of pn x is a polynomial hn f of degree 2 n 1 such that for 1 j n hn f xjn f xjn h n f xjn f xjn of course we have to assume f is defined at the zeros xjn to avoid this restriction the hermite fe jer interpolant h n f is often used instead it is a polynomial of degree 2 n 1 such that for 1 j n h n f xjn f xjn h n f xjn 0 hermite fe jer polynomials first came to prominence when fe jer used them with interpolation at zeros of chebyshev polynomials to provide another proof of weierstrass approximation theorem a close relative of the hermite fe jer interpolation polynomial is the gru nwald operator yn f x n j 1 f xjn 2 jn x where jn are the fundamental polynomials of lagrange interpolation taken at the zeros of pn x pn w 2 x yn has the advantage of being a positive operator which makes convergence more general though possibly at a slower rate than interpolatory operators convergence of hermite and hermite fe jer polynomials

derivatives of the interpolating polynomials have also been investigated here we note just one result of szabo 180 theorem 13 1 let w exp q f with a as in 4 18 let w 2 x w 2 x 1 q x 13 1 1 a log 2 q x

throughout c c 1 c 2 denote positive constants independent of n x t and polyno mials p of degree n the same symbol does not necessarily denote the same constant in different occurrences we write c c or c 6 c to respectively show that c depends on or does not depend on we use the notation in the following sense given sequences of real numbers cn and dn we write cn dn if for some positive constants c 1 c 2 independent of n we have c 1 cn dn c 2 if x is a real number then x denotes the greatest integer x throughout w exp q is an even exponential weight associated withw are the mhaskar rakhmanov saff numbers an an q the positive root of the equation n 2 1 0 antq ant 1 t 2 dt if xq x is strictly increasing with limits 0 and at 0 and respectively then an is uniquely defined corresponding to the weight w we define orthonormal polynomials pn x pn w 2 x nx n n 0 satisfying pnpmw 2 mn weighted approximation 91 note that the weight is w 2 not w we denote the zeros of pn by xnn xn 1 n x 2 n x 1 n

15 3 assume moreover that for some c 1 c 2 and c 3 0 yq y xq x c 1 q y q x c 2 y x c 3 then we write w e definition 15 4 general exponential weights feven c 2 let i d d where 0 d let q i 0 satisfy the
