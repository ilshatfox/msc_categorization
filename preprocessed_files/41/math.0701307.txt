ar x iv m at h 07 01 30 7 v 1 m at h c a 1 0 ja n 20 07 a new approach to universality limits involving orthogonal polynomials d s lubinsky abstract we show how localization and smoothing techniques can be used to establish universality in the bulk of the spectrum for a fixed positive measure on 1 1 assume that is a regular measure and is absolutely continuous in an open interval containing some closed subinterval j of 1 1 assume that in j the absolutely continuous component is positive and continuous then universality in j for follows from universality for the classical legendre weight we also establish universality in an lp sense under weaker assumptions on 1 introduction and results 1 let be a finite positive borel measure on 1 1 then we may define orthonormal polynomials pn x nx n n 0 n 0 1 2 satisfying the orthonormality conditions 1 1 pnpmd mn these orthonormal polynomials satisfy a recurrence relation of the form 1 1 xpn x an 1 pn 1 x bnpn x anpn 1 x where an n 1 n 0 and bn r n 1 and we use the convention p 1 0 throughout we use w d dx to denote the absolutely continuous part of a classic result of e a rakhmanov 12 asserts that if w 0 a e in 1 1 then belongs to the nevai blumenthal class m that is 1 2 lim n an 1 2 and lim n bn 0 we note that there are pure jump and pure singularly continuous measures in m despite the fact that one tends to associate it with weights

contains m is the class of regular measures on 1 1 13 defined by the condition lim n 1 nn 1 2 orthogonal polynomials play an important role in random matrix theory 3 8 one of the key limits there involves the reproducing kernel 1 3 kn x y n 1 k 0 pk x pk y because of the christoffel darboux formula it may also be expressed as 1 4 kn x y an pn x pn 1 y pn 1 x pn y x y define the normalized kernel 1 5 k n x y w x 1 2 w y 1 2 kn x y the simplest case of the universality law is the limit 1 6 lim n k n x aekn x x x bekn x x k n x x sin a b a b typically this holds uniformly for x in a compact subinterval of 1 1 and a b in compact subsets of the real line of course when a b we interpret sin a b a b as 1 we cannot hope to survey the vast body of results on universality limits here the reader may consult 1 3 4 8 and the forthcoming proceedings of the conference devoted to the 60 th birthday of percy deift our goal here is to present what we believe is a new approach based on localization and smoothing our main result is theorem 1 1 let be a finite positive borel measure on 1 1 that is regular let i be a closed subinterval of 1 1 such that is absolutely continuous in an open interval containing i assume that w is positive and continuous in i then uniformly for x i and a b in compact subsets of the real line we have 1 7 lim n k n x aekn x x x bekn x x k n x x sin a b a b note that we allow the case where i consists of just a single point corollary 1 2 let m 1 and rm y 1 y 2 ym det k n yi yj m i j 1 universality limits 3 denote the m point correlation function uniformly for x i and for given j m j 1 we have lim n 1 k n x x m rm x 1 k n x x x 2 k n x x x m k n x x det sin i j i j m i j 1 1 8 corollary 1 3 let r s be non negative integers and 1 9 k r s n x x n 1 k 0 p r k x p r k s let 1 10 r s 0 r s odd 1 r s 2 r s 1 r s even let i be a closed subinterval of i 0 then uniformly for x i 1 11 lim n 1 nr s 1 k r s n x x 1 w x 1 x 2 r s 1 2 r s remarks a we believe that the hypotheses above are the weakest imposed so far guaranteeing universality for a fixed weight on 1 1 most hypotheses imposed so far involve analyticity for example in 5 b the only reason for restricting a b to be real in 1 7 is that k n x aekn x x x bekn x x involves the weight evaluated at arguments involving a and b if we consider instead kn x aekn x x x bekn x x then the limits hold uniformly for a b in compact subsets of the plane we also present lp results assuming less about w theorem 1 4 let be a finite positive borel measure on 1 1 that is regular let p 0 let i be a closed subinterval of 1 1 in which is absolutely continuous and w is bounded above and below by positive constants and moreover w is riemann integrable in i then if i is a closed subinterval of i 0 1 12 lim n i k n x aekn x x x bekn x x k n x x sin a b a b p dx 0 4 d s lubinsky uniformly for a b in compact subsets of the real line the restriction of riemann integrability of w arises in showing w x aekn x x w x 1 as n in a suitable sense if we do not assume w is riemann inte grable in i we can prove theorem 1 5 let be a finite positive borel measure on 1 1 that is regular let p 0 let i be a closed subinterval of 1 1 in which is absolutely continuous and w is bounded above and below by positive constants then if i is a closed subinterval of i 0 uniformly for a b in compact subsets of the plane 1 13 lim n i kn x aekn x x x bekn x x kn x x sin a b a b p dx 0 when we assume only that w is bounded below and do not assume ab solute continuity of we can still prove an l 1 form of universality theorem 1 6 let be a finite positive borel measure on 1 1 that is regular let i be a closed subinterval of 1 1 in which w is bounded below by a positive con stant then if i is a closed subinterval of i 0 uniformly for a b in compact subsets of the plane 1 14 lim n i 1 n kn x a 1 x 2 n x b 1 x 2 n 1 w x 1 x 2 sin a b a b dx 0 in the sequel c c 1 c 2 denote constants independent of n x y s t the same symbol does not necessarily denote the same constant in different occurences we shall write c c or c 6 c to respectively denote dependence on or independence of the parameter given measures we use k n k n and p n p n to denote respectively their reproducing kernels and orthonormal polynomials similarly superscripts are used to distinguish other quantities associated with them the superscript l denotes quantities associated with the legendre weight 1 on 1 1 for x r and 0 we set i x x x recall that the nth christoffel function for a measure is n x 1 kn x x min deg p n 1 1 1 p 2 d p 2 x the most important new idea in this paper is a localization principle for universality we use it repeatedly in various forms but the following basic universality limits 5 inequality is typical suppose that are measures with in 1 1 then for x y 1 1 kn x y k n x y kn x x kn y y kn x x 1 2 1 k n x x kn x x 1 2 n x n y 1 2 1 n x n x 1 2 observe that on the right hand side we have only christoffel functions and their asymptotics are very well understood the paper is organised as follows in section 2 we present some asymp totics for christoffel functions in section 3 we prove our localization prin ciple including the above inequality in section 4 we approximate locally the measure in theorem 1 1 by a scaled jacobi weight and then prove theorem 1 1 in section 5 we prove the l 1 result theorem 1 6 and in section 6 prove the lp results theorem 1 4 and 1 5 in section 7 we prove corollaries 1 2 and 1 3 acknowledgement this research was stimulated by the wonderful conference in honor of percy deift s 60 th birthday held at the courant institute in june 2006 in the present form it was also inspired by a visit to peter sarnak at princeton university and discussions with eli levin during our collaboration on 6 2 christoffel functions we use ln to denote the nth christoffel function for the legendre weight on 1 1 the methods used to prove the following result are very well known but i could not find this theorem as stated in the literature the issue is that known asymptotics for christoffel functions do not include the increment a n we could use existing results in 7 9 10 15 to treat the case where x a n j and add a proof for the case where this fails but the amount of effort seems almost the same theorem 2 1 let be a regular measure on 1 1 assume that is absolutely contin uous in an open interval containing j c d and in j w is positive and continuous let a 0 then uniformly for a a a and x j 2 1 lim n n x a n ln x a n w x 6 d s lubinsky moreover uniformly for n n 0 a x j and a a a 2 2 n x a n 1 n the constants implicit in do not depend on remarks a the notation means that the ratio of the two christoffel functions is bounded above and below by positive constants independent of n and a b we emphasize that we are assuming that w is continuous in c d when regarded as a function defined on 1 1 c using asymptotics for ln we can rewrite 2 1 as lim n n n x a n 1 x 2 w x proof let 0 and choose 0 such that is absolutely continuous in i c d 1 1 and such that 2 3 1 1 w x w y 1 x c d with x y of course this is possible because of uniform continuity and positivity of w let us fix x 0 j let i x 0 x 0 x 0 and define a measure with in 1 1 i x 0 and in i x 0 let be absolutely continuous with absolutely continuous component w satisfying 2 4 w w x 0 1 in i x 0 because of 2 3 d d in 1 1 so that if n is the nth christoffel function for we have for all x 2 5 n x n x we now find an upper bound for n x for x i x 0 2 there exists r 0 1 depending only on such that 2 6 0 1 t x 2 2 r for x i x 0 2 and t 1 1 i x 0 in fact we may take r 1 4 2 let 0 1 2 and choose 1 so close to 1 that 2 7 1 r 4 universality limits 7 let m m n n 2 n 2 fix x i x 0 2 and choose a polynomial pm of degree m 1 such that lm x 1 1 p 2 m and p 2 m x 1 thus pm is the minimizing polynomial in the christoffel function for the legendre weight at x let sn t pm t 1 t x 2 2 n 2 a polynomial of degree m 1 2 n 2 n 1 with sn x 1 then using 2 4 and 2 6 n x 1 1 s 2 nd w x 0 1 i x 0 p 2 m pm 2 l 1 1 i x 0 r n 2 1 1 i x 0 d w x 0 1 lm x pm 2 l 1 1 r n 2 1 1 d now we use the key idea from 7 lemma 9 p 450 for m m 0 we have pm 2 l 1 1 m 1 1 p 2 m m lm x this holds more generally for any polynomial p of degree m 1 and is a consequence of the regularity of the legendre weight alternatively we could use classic bounds for the christoffel functions for the legendre weight then from 2 7 uniformly for x i x 0 2 n x w x 0 1 lm x 1 c 1 r 2 n w x 0 1 lm x 1 o 1 so as n n sup x i x 0 2 n x l n x w x 0 1 1 o 1 sup x i x 0 lm x l n x 2 8 the o 1 terms is independent of x 0 now for large enough n and some c independent of m n x 0 2 9 sup x 1 1 lm x l n x 1 c 8 d s lubinsky indeed if plk denote the orthonormal legendre polynomials they admit the bound 9 p 170 plk x c 1 x 2 1 k 2 1 4 x 1 1 then uniformly for x 1 1 0 1 l n x lm x ln x n 1 k m plk x 2 c ln x n m maxn 2 k n 1 x 2 1 k 2 1 2 c n ln x 1 x 2 1 n 2 1 2 c by classical bounds for christoffel functions 9 p 108 lemma 5 so we have 2 9 and then 2 8 and 2 3 give for n n 0 n 0 x 0 sup x i x 0 2 n x ln x w x 1 2 1 c by covering j with finitely many such intervals i x 0 2 we obtain for some maximal threshhold n 1 that for n n 1 n 1 j sup x c 2 d 2 n x ln x w x 1 2 1 c it is is essential here that c is independent of now let a 0 and a a there exists n 2 n 2 a such that for n n 2 and all a a and all x j we have x a n c 2 d 2 we deduce that lim sup n sup a a a x j n x a n ln x a n w x 1 2 1 c as the left hand side is independent of the parameters we deduce that 2 10 lim sup n sup a a a x j n x a n ln x a n w x 1 in a similar way we can establish the converse bound 2 11 lim sup n sup a a a x j ln x a n w x n x a n 1 indeed with m x and as above let us choose a polynomial p of degree m 1 such that m x 1 1 p 2 m t d t and p 2 m x 1 universality limits 9 then with sn as above and proceeding as above ln x 1 1 s 2 n w x 0 1 1 i x 0 p 2 md pm 2 l 1 1 i x 0 r n 2 1 1 i x 0 1 w x 0 1 1 m x 1 c 1 1 r 2 n and so as above sup x i x 0 2 lm x m x w x 0 1 1 1 o 1 sup x i x 0 2 lm x l n x w x 0 1 1 1 o 1 1 c then 2 11 follows after a scale change m n and using monotonicity of n in n much as above together 2 10 and 2 11 give 2 1 finally 2 2 follows from standard bounds for the christoffel function for the legendre weight 3 localization theorem 3 1 assume that are regular measures on 1 1 that are absolutely con tinuous in an open interval containing j c d assume that w is positive and continuous in j and d d in j let a 0 then as n 3 1 sup a b a a x j kn k n x a n x b n n o 1 proof we initially assume that 3 2 d d in 1 1 the idea is to estimate the l 2 norm of kn x t k n x t over 1 1 and then to use christoffel function estimates now 1 1 kn x t k n x t 2 d t 1 1 k 2 n x t d t 2 1 1 kn x t k n x t d t 1 1 k 2 n x t d t kn x x 2 k n x x 1 1 k 2 n x t d t 10 d s lubinsky by the reproducing kernel property as d d we also have 1 1 k 2 n x t d t 1 1 k 2 n x t d t k n x x so 1 1 kn x t k n x t 2 d t kn x x k n x x 3 3 next for any polynomial p of degree n 1 we have the christoffel function estimate 3 4 p y kn y y 1 2 1 1 p 2 d 1 2 applying this to p t kn x t k n x t and using 3 3 gives for all x y 1 1 kn x y k n x y kn y y 1 2 kn x x k n x x 1 2 so kn x y k n x y kn x x kn y y kn x x 1 2 1 k n x x kn x x 1 2 3 5 now we set x x 0 a n and y x 0 b n where a b a a and x 0 j by theorem 2 1 uniformly for such x k n x x kn x x 1 o 1 for they both have the same asymptotics as for the weight w on 1 1 moreover uniformly for a b a a kn x 0 b n x 0 b n kn x 0 a n x 0 a n n so sup a b a a x 0 j kn k n x 0 a n x 0 b n n o 1 now we drop the extra hypothesis 3 2 define a measure by in j and in 1 1 j let d x max x c x d w x w x dx d s x d s x where w w and s s are respectively the absolutely continuous and sin gular components of then d d and d d and is regular as its absolutely continuous component is positive in 1 1 and hence lies in the even smaller class m moreover is absolutely continuous in an open interval containing j and w in j the case above shows that the reproducing kernels for and have the same asymptotics as that for in the sense of 3 1 and hence the same asymptotics as each other universality limits 11 4 smoothing in this section we approximate of theorem 1 1 by a scaled legendre jacobi measure and then prove theorem 1 1 recall that k n is the nor malized kernel given by 1 5 our smoothing result which may also be viewed as localization is theorem 4 1 let be as in theorem 1 1 let a 0 0 1 2 and choose 0 such that 2 3 holds let x 0 j then there exists c and n 0 such that for n n 0 4 1 sup a b a a x i xo 2 j k n kln x a n x b n n c 1 2 where c is independent of n x 0 proof fix x 0 j and let w be the scaled legendre weight w w x 0 in 1 1 note that 4 2 k n x y 1 w x 0 kln x y recall that the superscript indicates the legendre weight on 1 1 be cause of our localization result theorem 3 1 we may replace d by w x dx where w w in i x 0 and w w x 0 in 1 1 i x 0 without affecting the asymptotics forkn x a n x b n in the interval i x 0 2 note that and play no role in theorem 3 1 so in the sequel we as sume that w w x 0 w in 1 1 i x 0 while not changing w in i observe that 2 3 implies that 4 3 1 1 w w 1 in 1 1 then much as in the previous section 1 1 kn x t k n x t 2 w t dt 1 1 k 2 n x t w t dt 2 1 1 kn x t k n x t w t dt 1 1 k 2 n x t w t dt 1 1 k 2 n x t w t dt i x 0 k 2 n x t w w t dt 2 kn x x k n x x k n x x kn x x i x 0 k 2 n x t w w t dt 12 d s lubinsky recall that w w in 1 1 i by 4 3 i x 0 k 2 n x t w w t dt i x 0 k 2 n x t w t dt kn x x so 4 4 1 1 kn x t k n x t 2 w t dt k n x x 1 kn x x applying an obvious analogue of 3 4 to p t kn x t k n x t and using 4 4 gives for y 1 1 kn x y k n x y k n y y 1 2 k n x x 1 kn x x 1 2 so kn x y k n x y k n x x k n y y k n x x 1 2 1 1 kn x x k n x x 1 2 in view of 4 3 we also have kn x x k n x x n x n x 1 1 so for all y 1 1 kn x y k n x y k n x x k n y y k n x x 1 2 1 1 1 1 2 2 k n y y k n x x 1 2 2 kln y y kln x x 1 2 2 ln x ln y 1 2 here we have used 4 2 now we set x x 1 a n and y x 1 b n where x 1 i x 0 2 and a b a a by classical estimates for christoffel functions for the legendre weight or even theorem 2 1 uniformly for a b a a and x 1 j ln x 1 b n ln x 1 a n n 1 universality limits 13 and also the constants implicit in are independent of and x 1 this is crucial thus for some c and n 0 depending only on a and j we have for n n 0 sup a b a a x 1 i x 0 2 j kn k n x 1 a n x 1 b n n c finally recall 4 2 that 1 1 w x 1 w x 0 1 for all x 1 i x 0 and that w is continuous at the endpoints of i x 0 2 j proof of theorem 1 1 let a 1 0 choose 0 so small that the right hand side c 1 2 of 4 1 is less than 1 choose 0 such that 2 3 holds now divide j into say m intervals i xj 2 1 j m each of length for each j there exists a threshhold n 0 n 0 j for which 4 1 holds for n n 0 j with i x 0 2 replaced by i xj 2 let n 1 denote the largest of these then we obtain for n n 1 sup a b a a x 0 j k n kln x a n x b n n 1 it follows that 4 5 lim n sup a b a a x j k n kln x a n x b n 0 finally the universality limit for the legendre weight see for example 5 gives as n 1 x 2 n kln x u 1 x 2 n x v 1 x 2 n sin u v u v 4 6 uniformly for u v in compact subsets of the real line and x in compact subsets of 1 1 setting a u 1 x 2 and b v 1 x 2 in 4 5 we obtain as n uniformly for x j and u v in compact subsets of the real line lim n 1 x 2 n k n x u 1 x 2 n x v 1 x 2 n sin u v u v 4 7 14 d s lubinsky since uniformly for x j by theorem 2 1 k n x x 1 kln x x 1 1 o 1 1 x 2 n 1 o 1 we then also obtain the conclusion of theorem 1 1 for future use we record also that 4 8 lim n 1 n k n x a n x b

1 1 i the restriction of to universality limits 15 i is regular as its absolutely continuous component w 0 there then theorem 5 3 3 in 13 p 148 shows that is regular as a measure on all of 1 1 c in view of 5 1 we have for x i n x c 0 inf deg p n 1 i p 2 p 2 x c 0 c 1 n here we are using classical bounds for the legendre weight translated to the interval i and the constant c 1 depends only on the intervals i and i then the first bound in 5 3 follows and that for n is similar since the lower bound on in i is independent of it follows that the constants we obtain in 5 3 will also be independent of d since is regular and w is bounded below by a positive constant in i we have a e in i lim n kn x x n 1 w x 1 x 2 see for example 7 p 449 thm 8 or 15 theorem 1 a similar limit holds for k n n we also have the uniform bound in c then lebesgue s dominated convergence theorem gives the result e recall that i is a positive distance from 1 while w w are bounded below in i by c 0 2 then i 1 1 t 2 1

is positive and continuous in i theorem 2 1 shows that for some c 0 n x c n for x i and n 1 and then 6 4 n kn x x n n x c for x i and n 1 the definition 6 2 of rn the fact that w is bounded below in i and this last inequality give 6 3 proof of theorem 1 5 as w is bounded above and below in i the lemma and theorem 1 6 give uniformly for a b a a lim n i kn x a k n x x x b k n x x w x 1 x 2 n sin a b a b dx 0 now a e in i 1 kn x x w x 1 x 2 n 1 o 1 moreover by 6 4 lemma 5 1 c and cauchy schwarz both 1 n kn x a k n x x x b k n x x and kn x a k n x x x b k n x x kn x x are bounded above uniformly for a b a a x i and n n 0 we deduce that lim n i kn x a k n x x x b k n x x kn x x sin a b a b dx 0 finally as we have just noted the integrand in the last integral is bounded above uniformly for a b a a x i and n n 0 so we may replace the first power by the pth power for any p 1 for p 1 we can use ho lder s inequality in proving theorem 1 4 our last step is to replace kn x a ekn x x x b ekn x x kn x x universality limits 21 by ekn x a ekn x x x b ekn x x ekn x x this is more difficult than one might expect it is only here that we need riemann integrability of w in i for general lebesgue measurable w it seems difficult to deal with the factor k n x x w x kn x x below lemma 6 2 assume that w is riemann integrable and bounded below by a positive con stant in i let i be a compact subinterval of i let p a 0 then uniformly for a b a a we have lim n i w x a k n x x w x b k n x x w x 1 p dx 0 proof let a b a a from 6 4 for a suitable integer n 0 and some l 0 we have a k n x x l n and b k n x x l n uniformly for x i a b a a and n n 0 next as w is riemann integrable in i it is continuous a e in i 11 p 23 for x i and n 1 let n x sup w x s w x s l n note that for x i n n 0 and a b a a w x a k n x x w x n x we have at every point of continuity of w and in particular for a e x i lim n n x 0 moreover as w is riemann integrable n is bounded above in i uniformly in n then lebesgue s dominated convergence theorem gives uniformly for a a a i w x a k n x x w x p dx i n x p dx 0 n this the fact that w is bounded above and below and some elementary manipulations give the result proof of theorem 1 4 22 d s lubinsky since kn x a ekn x x x b ekn x x kn x x is bounded uniformly in n x a b over the rel evant ranges and k n x aekn x x x bekn x x k n x x kn x aekn x x x bekn x x kn x x w x a k n x x w x b k n x x w x this follows directly from the lemma above and theorem 1 5 7 proof of corollaries 1 2 and 1 3 proof of corollary 1 2 this follows directly by substituting 1 6 into the determinant defining rm in proving corollary 1 3 we need lemma 7 1 let w c in i and i i be closed subintervals of i 0 such that i is contained in the interior of i let a 0 there exists c 2 such that for n 1 x i and all c with a 7 1 1 n kn x n x n c 2 proof recall that 1 n kn x x is uniformly bounded above for x i by lemma 5 1 c applying cauchy schwarz we obtain for x y i 7 2 1 n kn x y 1 n kn x x 1 n kn y y c 1 next we note bernstein s growth lemma for polynomials in the plane 2 theorem 2 2 p 101 if p is a polynomial of degree n we have for z 1 1 p z z z 2 1 n p l 1 1 from this we deduce that given l 0 and 0 1 there exists c 2 6 c 2 n p z such that for re z and im z ln p z c 2 p l 1 1 mapping this to i by a linear transformation we deduce that for re z i and im z l n p z c 3 p l i universality limits 23 where c 3 6 c 3 n p z we now apply this to 1 nkn x y separately in each variable obtaining the stated result proof of corollary 1 3 note first from the lemma 1 n kn x n x n n 1 is analytic in and uniformly bounded for in compact subsets of the plane moreover from 4 8 and continuity of w lim n 1 n w x kn x n x n sin 1 x 2 uniformly for x i and in compact subsets of i by convergence con tinuation theorems this last limit then holds uniformly for in compact subsets of the plane next expanding pk x n and pk x n in taylor series about x 1 n kn x n x n 1 n n 1 k 0 pk x n pk x n 1 n r s 0 n r r n s s n 1 k 0 p r k x p s k x r s 0 r r s s 1 nr s 1 k r s n x x with the notation 1 9 since the series terminates the interchanges are valid by using the maclaurin series of sin and the binomial theorem we see that sin r s 0 r r s s r s where r s is given by 1 10 since uniformly convergent sequences of ana lytic functions have taylor series that also converge we see that for x i and each r s 0 lim n 1 nr s 1 w x k r s n x x r s 1 x 2 r s 2 this establishes the limit 1 11 but we must still prove uniformity let a 0 by the uniform convergence in theorem 1 1 there exists n 0 such that for n n 0 w x 1 x 2 n kn x a 1 x 2 n x b 1 x 2 n w y 1 y 2 n kn y a 1 y 2 n y b 1 y 2 n 7 3 24 d s lubinsky uniformly for x y i a b a a and n n 0 using bernstein s growth inequality as in the lemma above applied to the polynomial in the left hand side of 7 3 we obtain that this inequality persists for complex with a except that we must replace by c where c depends only on a not on n x a b we can now use cauchy s inequalities to bound the taylor series coefficients of the double series in a b implicit in the left hand side in 7 3 this leads to bounds on 1 nr s 1 w x k r s n x x 1
