space x which can be approx imated by elements in a subset a of x that is to say approximation theory allows to characterize the closure of a in x the first significant results of previous type were those of karl weierstrass 1815 1897 who proved in 1885 when he was 70 years old the density of algebraic polynomials in the class of continuous real valued functions on a compact interval and the density of trigonometric polynomials in the class of 2 periodic continuous real valued functions such results were in a sense a counterbalance to weierstrass famous example of 1861 on the existence of a continuous nowhere differentiable function the existence of such func tions accentuated the need for analytic rigor in mathematics for a further understanding of the nature of the set of continuous functions and substan tially influenced the development of analysis this example represented for some mathematicians a lamentable plague as hermite wrote to stieltjes on may 20 1893 see 3 so that we can say the approximation theorems were a panacea while on the one hand the set of continuous functions con tains deficient functions on the other hand every continuous function can be approximated arbitrarily well by the ultimate in smooth functions the polynomials weierstrass was interested in complex function theory and in the ability to represent functions by power series the result obtained in his paper in 1885 should be viewed from that perspective moreover the title of the paper emphasizes such viewpoint his paper was titled on the possibility of giving an analytic representation to an arbitrary function of real variable see 16 weierstrass perception on analytic functions was of functions that could be represented by power series the paper of weierstrass 1885 was reprinted in weierstrass mathema tische werke collected works with some notable additions for example a short introduction this reprint appeared in 1903 and contains the following divulgaciones matema ticas vol 16 no 1 2008 pp 231 247 a survey on the weierstrass approximation theorem 233 statement the main result of this paper restricted to the one variable case can be summarized as follows let f c r then there exists a sequence f 1 f 2 of entire functions for which f x i 1 fi x for each x r in addition the convergence of the above sum is uniform on every finite interval notice that there isn t mention of the fact that the fi s may be assumed to be polynomials we state the weierstrass approximation theorem not as given in his paper but as it is currently stated and understood theorem 1 1 k weierstrass given f a b r continuous and an arbitrary 0 there exists an algebraic polynomial p such that f x p x x a b 1 1 over the next twenty five or so years numerous alternative proofs were given to this result by a roster of some the best analysts of the period two papers of runge published almost at the same time gave another proof of the theorem but unfortunately the theorem was not titled weierstrass runge theorem the impact of the theorem of weierstrass in the world of the math ematics was immediate there were later proofs of famous mathematicians such as picard 1891 volterra 1897 lebesgue 1898 mittag leffler 1900 landau 1908 de la vallee poussin 1912 the proofs more commonly taken at level of undergraduate courses in mathematics are those of feje r 1900 and bernstein 1912 see for example 4 7 16 or 20 we only present a limited sampling of the many results that has been related with weierstrass approximation theorem which can be found in ap proximation theory and others areas we would like to include all results but the length of this paper would not be suffice enough in addition we don t prove most of the results we quote we hope nonetheless that the readers will find something here of interest in regards to the outline of the paper it is as follows section 2 is ded icated to describe some improvements generalizations and ramifications of weierstrass approximation theorem section 3 presents some new results on the subject and to introduce some open problems divulgaciones matema ticas vol 16 no 1 2008 pp 231 247 234 dilcia pe rez yamilet quintana 2 improvements generalizations and ramifica tions of weierstrass approximation theorem there are many improvements generalizations and ramifications of weier strass approximation theorem for instance we could let f be a complex valued or take values in a real or complex vector space of finite dimension that is easy we could let f be a function of several real variables then it is also easy to formulate the result and we could let f be a function of several complex variables that would require a more profound study with skillful adaptations of both hypothesis and conclusion finally of course we may try with functions which take theirs values in an infinite dimensional space see section 3 below among the results of this kind we can find theorem 2 1 bernstein let f 0 1 r bounded then lim n bn f x f x for each x 0 1 where f is continuous furthermore if f c 0 1 then bn f x converges to f uniformly notice that if f c a b we can take y x a b a for translate the ap proximation problem to interval 0 1 and to use the bernstein polynomials bn f y the theorem of bernstein besides showing weierstrass result gives a bonus an explicit expression for the polynomial approximants to the function simultaneously with the study of the approximation for algebraic poly nomials also the approximation by trigonometrical polynomials was investi gated beginning with fourier series the problem can generally be outlined given fi i a sequence of a normed space x when fi i is fundamental in x i e when holds that for every g x and 0 exist n and a sequence of scalars ci i such that g n i 1 cifi this question occupied to many mathematicians during the past century maybe the oldest and simpler example was proposed by bernstein in 1912 approximately let i i 1 a sequence of distinct positive numbers when the functions 1 x 1 x 2 x 3 are fundamental in c 0 1 also the answer was surmised by bernstein and it is given in the following theorems divulgaciones matema ticas vol 16 no 1 2008 pp 231 247 a survey on the weierstrass approximation theorem 235 theorem 2 2 mu ntz s first theorem consider the set of functions x 1 x 2 where 1 2 i it is fundamental in the least squares norm on 0 1 if and only if i 6 0 1 i theorem 2 3 mu ntz s second theorem 1914 let i i 1 a sequence of distinct positive numbers such that 1 i then the set of functions 1 x 1 x 2 x 3 is fundamental in c 0 1 if and only if i 1 1 i by some time this last theorem was called mu ntz szasz theorem because szasz published an independent proof of it in 1916 seemingly bernstein solved part of the problem in fact taking i i we can recover the weier strass approximation theorem for 0 1 furthermore the mu ntz s second theorem is all the more interesting be cause it traces a logical connection between two apparently unrelated facts the fundamentality of 1 x x 2 x 3 and the divergence of the series of re ciprocal exponents n 1 1 n in fact if we wish to delete functions from the set while maintaining its fundamentality this divergence is precisely the prop erty that must be preserved the reader is referred to 7 for the proofs of the both theorems the combination of dual spaces theory and complex analysis are very usual in the study of fundamental sequences another application of these techniques is given to solve the problem ofwiener on traslation of fundamental sequences such problem dates from the thirty s decade of the past century and is related with the problems of invariant spaces this problem has generated almost so much investigation as mu ntz theorem the following theorem is a version of wiener s theorem theorem 2 4 wiener approximately 1933 let f l 1 r for all g l 1 r and every 0 there are cj j j j r such that g x n j 1 cjf x j l 1 r if and only if the fourier transform f doesn t have real zeros that is to say e itx f t dt 6 0 x r we shall enunciate two additional theorems on fundamental sequences which was published in the 30 s of last century and appear in the russian divulgaciones matema ticas vol 16 no 1 2008 pp 231 247 236 dilcia pe rez yamilet quintana edition of the book of akhiezer 2 and also in the translation of this book to german but not in the translation to english theorem 2 5 akhiezer krein fundamental sequences of rational functions with simple poles if aj j 1 c 1 1 is such that aj 6 ak j 6 k then the sequence 1 x aj j 1 is fundamental in lp 1 1 1 p and in c 1 1 iff k 1 1 ak a 2 k 1 where the branch of the function f z z considered is the usual is to say z 0 for z 0 theorem 2 6 paley wiener 1934 trigonometric series non harmonic if j j 1 c is such that j 6 k j 6 k and j 2 j 1 then the sequence e 2 x ix j j 1 is fundamental in l 2 r iff j 1 cos j coth j where z z denote respectively the real and imaginary parts of the complex number z other result which despite its recent discovery has already become classi cal and should be a part of the background of every student of mathematics is the following theorem 2 7 m h stone approximately 1947 let k be a compact subset of rn and let l be a collection of continuous functions on k to r with the properties i if f g belong to l then sup f g and inf f g belong to l ii if a b r and x 6 y k then there exists a function f in l such that f x a f y b then any continuous function on k to r can be uniformly approximated on k by functions in l divulgaciones matema ticas vol 16 no 1 2008 pp 231 247 a survey on the weierstrass approximation theorem 237 the reader is referred to the paper 28 in which the original proof of stone appears another known result but not very noted is due to e hewitt 12 this work appeared published in 1947 and it presents certain generalizations of the stone weierstrass theorem which are valid in all completely regular spaces there exist another three problems on approximation which have had a substantial influence on the analysis of last century 1 the problem on polynomial approximation of bernstein on whole real line between 1912 and 50 s 2 to characterize the closure of polynomials in families of functions defined on compact sets k c between 1885 and 50 s it is also necessary to mention here the kakutani stone theorem on the closure of a lattice of functions real valued and stone weierstrass theorem on the closure of an algebra of functions continuous complex valued see 28 18 3 the szego s extremum problem between 1920 and 40 s with respect the first problem it must be treated for non bounded poly nomials in if let us consider a weight w r 0 1 i e a non negative measurable function and we define cw f r r continuous with lim x fw x 0 with norm f cw fw l r bernstein wondered when holds that for all f cw and every 0 there exists a polynomial p such that f p w l r 2 2 the condition fw null in is necessary to give sense to the problem we would like pw l r p p and in particular xnw l r n 0 notice that this condition necessarily makes lim x xnw x 0 then using 2 2 we would have fw l r therefore fw is null in among those that contributed to the solution of this problem are bernstein 1912 1924 t s hall 1939 1950 dzrbasjan 1947 and videnskii 1953 in the case w continuous weight the solution solution was given by h pollard 1953 other solutions were given by akhiezer 1954 mergelyan 1956 and carleson 1951 divulgaciones matema ticas vol 16 no 1 2008 pp 231 247 238 dilcia pe rez yamilet quintana the techniques used in the solution of bernstein s problem includes dual spaces theory other problems of approximation entire functions theory analytic on the half plane and a lot of hard work for the approximation problem on compact subset of the complex plane the situation is as follows let k a compact set of complex plane we define a k f k c continuous in k and analytic in k where k denotes the interior of k and the norm is given by f f l k if we consider p k f k c such that there exist polynomials pn with lim n f pn l k 0 the interesting question is when p k a k may be this problem was never assigned a name but in spirit it should be called the runge problem 1885 whose fundamental contributions to ap proximation theory still can be seen in the course of complex analysis among the interested on the solution of this problem are j l walsh 1926 hartogs rosenthal 1931 lavrentiev 1936 and keldysh 1945 theorem 2 8 mergelyan 1950 s let k c compact the following statements are equivalent 1 p k a k 2 c k is connected with respect to szego s extremum problem it can be expressed as follows let us consider a non negative and finite borel measure on the unit circle z c z 1 and p 0 the szego s extremum

polynomial this problem has had more impact in approximation theory than bern stein s problem or the mergelyan theorem its solution and the techniques developed from it have had a great influence in the spaces hardy theory and also on the functions theory in the 20 th century theorem 2 9 szego 1921 let absolutely continuous measure with respect to lebesgue measure on the unit circle with d z w ei d then p exp 1 2 2 0 log w ei d first szego showed this result with w a trigonometric polynomial and then he used such approximation for extending the result for w continuous function and also for general case see 29 the generalization to not necessarily absolutely continuous measures came later twenty years and is the merit of a n kolmogorov 1941 for p 2 and m g krein 1945 for p 0 theorem 2 10

theory the condition 2 0 log w ei d is called the szego s condition in recent years it has arisen a new focus on the generalizations of weier strass approximation theorem which uses the weighted approximation or ap proximation by weighted polynomials more precisely if i is a compact inter val the approximation problem is studied with the norm l i w defined by f l i w ess supx i f x w x 2 3 where w is a weight i e a non negative measurable function and the conven tion 0 0 is used notice that 1 1 is not the usual definition of the l norm in the context of measure theory although it is the correct definition when we work with weights see e g 5 and 10 considering weighted norms l w has been proved to be interesting mainly because of two reasons first it allows to wider the set of approx imable functions since the functions in l w can have singularities where the weight tends to zero and second it is possible to find functions which approximate f whose qualitative behavior is similar to the one of f at those points where the weight tends to infinity in this case it is easy to see that l i w and l i are isomorphic since the map w l i w l i given by w f fw is a linear and bijective isometry and therefore w is also homeomorphism or equivalently y l i w w y w y where we take each closure with respect to the norms l i w and l i in each case analogously for all a l i 1 w a 1 w a and 1 w w 1 then using weierstrass theorem we have 1 w p 1 w p f l i fw c i 2 4 unfortunately in many applications it is not just the isomorphism type is of interest since the last equality in 2 4 doesn t allow to obtain information on local behavior of the functions f l i w which can be approximated furthermore if f l i w then in general fw is not continuous function divulgaciones matema ticas vol 16 no 1 2008 pp 231 247 a survey on the weierstrass approximation theorem 241 since its continuity depends of the nature of weight w so arises the necessary research of the family of weights for which have sense the approximation problem by continuous functions the reader can find in 22 and 27 a recent and detailed study of such problem it is precisely in 22 where appears one of the most general results known at the present time theorem 2 11 25 theorem 2 1 let w be any weight and h 0 f l w f is continuous to the right at every point of r w f is continuous to the left at every point of r w for each a s w ess limx a f x f a w x 0 for each a s w ess limx a f x f a w x 0 then a the closure of c r l w in l w is h 0 b if w l loc r then the closure of c r l w in l w is also h 0 c if suppw is compact and w l r then the closure of the space of polynomials is h 0 as well another special kind of approximation problems arise when we consider simultaneous approximation which includes to derivatives of certain functions this is the case of versions of weierstrass theorem in weighted sobolev spaces in our opinion very interesting results in such direction appears in 24 under enough general conditions concerning the vector weight the so called type 1 defined in a bounded interval i the authors characterize to the closure in the weighted sobolev space w k i w of the spaces of

extension of the weierstrass approximation theorem throughout this section let us consider a real and separable hilbert space g a compact interval i r the space l g i of all g valued essentially bounded functions a weakly measurable function w i g the space p g of all g valued polynomials and the space l g i w of all g valued functions which are bounded whit respect to the norm defined by f l g i w ess supt i fw t g 3 5 where fw i g is defined as follows if dim g we have the func tions f and w can be expressed as f f 1 fn 0 and w w 1 wn 0 respectively where fk wj i r for j 1 n 0 with n 0 dimg then fw t f 1 t w 1 t fn 0 t wn 0 t for t i if dimg let j j z be a complete orthonormal system then fw t j 0 f t j g w t j g j for t i it is known that every g is a real separable hilbert space isomorphic either to rn for some n n or to l 2 r and in both cases g has a structure of commutative banach algebra with the coordinatewise operations and identity in the first case and without identity in the second case see 14 we use this fact in what follows divulgaciones matema ticas vol 16 no 1 2008 pp 231 247 a survey on the weierstrass approximation theorem 243 3 1 g valued functions let g a real separable hilbert space a g valued polynomial on i is a function i g such that t n n nt n where n n g has finite support let p g be the space of all g valued polynomials on i it is well known that p g is a subalgebra of the space of all continuous g valued functions on i we denote by l g i the set of all weakly measurable essentially bounded functions f i g for 1 p let lpg i denote the set of all weakly measurable functions f i g such that i f t pg dt then l 2 g i is a hilbert space with respect to inner product f g l 2 g i i f t g t g dt p g is also dense in lpg i for 1 p more details about these spaces can be found in 30 in 26 the author studies the set of functions g valued which can be ap proximated by g valued continuous functions in the norm l g i w where i is a compact interval g is a real and separable hilbert space and w is certain g valued weakly measurable weight and using the previous results of 24 the author obtains a new extension of weierstrass approximation theorem in the context of real separable hilbert spaces 3 2 approximation in w 1 g i for dealing with definition of sobolev space w 1 g i first of all notice that we need a definition of derivative f of a function f l g i such definition can be introduced by means of the properties of g and the definition of classical sobolev spaces as follows divulgaciones matema ticas vol 16 no 1 2008 pp 231 247 244 dilcia pe rez yamilet quintana definition 3 1 given g a real separable hilbert space and f i g we say that a function g i g is the derivative of f if g f 1 f n 0 if dimg n 0 f k k

sense of the definition 3 1 and f l g i with norm f w 1 g i f l g i f l g i 3 3 interesting problems the following problem in this area arises if we consider the norm f w 1 g i w f l g i w f l g i w and we define the weighted sobolev space of g valued functions by means of the relation f w 1 g i w f l g i w there exists f in the sense of the definition 3 1 and f l g i w then we can ask 1 what is p g w 1 i w 2 which are the most general conditions on the weight w which allow to characterize p g w 1 i w remark 3 1 some pieces of information are taken from internet based re sources without the
