dimension elevation in mu ntz spaces a new emergence of the mu ntz condition rachid ait haddou king abdullah university of science and technology thuwal saudi arabia abstract we show that the limiting polygon generated by the dimension elevation algo rithm with respect to the mu ntz space span 1 tr 1 tr 2 trm with 0 r 1 r 2 rm and limn rn over an interval a b 0 converges to the underlying chebyshev be zier curve if and only if the mu ntz condition i 1 1 ri is satisfied the surprising emergence of the mu ntz condition in the problem raises the question of a possible connection between the density questions of nested chebyshev spaces and the convergence of the corresponding dimension elevation algorithms the question of convergence with no condition of monotonicity or positivity on the pairwise distinct real numbers ri remains an open problem keywords mu ntz spaces chebyshev blossoming dimension elevation chebyshev bernstein bases gelfond bernstein bases schur functions chebyshev be zier curves 1 introduction degree elevation of be zier curves is a standard technique in computer aided curve design it consists of iteratively expressing a be zier curve of a fixed degree in the bernstein bases of the linear spaces of polynomials of higher degrees the process generates a sequence of control polygons which converges uniformly to the underlying be zier curve 16 degree elevation or more appropriately di mension elevation can be generalized to any infinite nested sequence of linear spaces in which an analogue notion of bernstein basis can be defined more pre cisely let e u 1 u 2 um be an infinite sequence of sufficiently differen tiable functions ui over an interval a b and such that for every n 1 the linear space den span u 1 u 2 u n is an extended chebyshev space of dimension n over a b 12 then for any n 1 the linear space en span 1 u 1 un possesses a so called chebyshev bernstein basis bnk k 0 n and character ized as the unique normalized basis of en such that for every k 1 n the function bnk has k zeros at a and n k zeros at b 13 a chebyshev be zier curve in the space en can be expressed in the chebyshev bernstein bases of the spaces en and en 1 over an interval a b as

i 1 n there exist real numbers i 0 1 such that p 1 i 1 i pi 1 ipi 1 iterating the process of expressing the curve in the chebyshev bernstein bases of the nested sequence of spaces en 1 en 2 em generates a sequence of control polygons since dimension elevation is a corner cutting scheme the generated sequence converges to a lipschitz continuous curve 6 however a difficult question is to characterize the sequences e in which the limiting polygon converges uniformly to the underlying chebyshev be zier curve here we report our complete solution to the problem when e is the mu ntz sequence e t r 1 tr 2 trn with 0 r 1 r 2 rm and limn rn more precisely we have theorem 1 the limiting polygon generated by the dimension elevation algo rithm with respect to the mu ntz space span 1 tr 1 tr 2 trm with 0 r 1 r 2 rm and limn rn over an interval a b 0 converges uniformly to the underlying non constant chebyshev be zier curve if and only if i 1 1 ri 2 let us compare our theorem with the celebrated original mu ntz theorem on the density of mu ntz spaces 1 8 15 theorem 2 mu ntz theorem let r 1 r 2 rm be an infinite strictly increasing sequence of positive real numbers such that limn rn the mu ntz space span 1 tr 1 trm is a dense subset of c 0 1 the linear space of continuous functions on 0 1 endowed with the uniform norm if and only if i 1 1 ri the emergence of the mu ntz condition 2 in both theorem 1 and theorem 2 is rather surprising and may suggest a deep connection between the prob lem of density of nested chebyshev spaces and the convergence of the associ ated dimension elevation algorithms for nested mu ntz spaces over the interval 0 1 a hypothesis of equivalence is ruled out by the fact that the condition limn rn can be dropped in mu ntz theorem 2 5 while such condi tion is necessary for the convergence of the dimension elevation over 0 1 to the underlying curve see theorem 5 however the necessity of the condition limn rn in theorem 1 remains an open problem it is interesting to note that as much as the classical weierstrass approxi mation theorem is a special case of mu ntz theorem for the exponents rn n the classical convergence theorem of the degree elevation of be zier curves is a consequence of theorem 1 for the same set of exponents the mu ntz condition 2 also appears in different contexts other than the density questions of mu ntz spaces such as in biernack theorem on entire func tions 11 in ramm horva th theorem on the inverse scattering problem 9 or in the famous erdo s conjecture on arithmetic progressions 7 2 the strategy for the proof of theorem 1 for nested mu ntz spaces the analytical form of i in 1 can be expressed in terms of a quotient of generalized schur functions that depend on the interval parameters a and b 2 iterating the dimension elevation process using these quotients leads to complicated expressions that hinder a direct proof of theorem 1 the limiting curve generated by the dimension elevation in mu ntz spaces over an interval a b depends only on the shape parameter b a 12 therefore we only need to prove theorem 1 over an interval a 1 with 0 a 1 taking into account the special role of the origin in the density questions of mu ntz spaces 5 we could first look at the dimension elevation algorithm in mu ntz spaces over the interval 0 1 an apparent obstruction to such strategy is the fact that mu ntz spaces does not possess chebyshev bernstein bases over the interval 0 1 fortunately as we will show in this work the pointwise limits of the chebyshev bernstein bases over an interval a 1 as a goes to zero do exist and in fact coincide with the gelfond bernstein bases of mu ntz spaces 3 the dimension elevation algorithm for the gelfond bernstein bases over the interval 0 1 can be easily expressed this allows us to prove theorem 1 over the interval 0 1 to prove theorem 1 over an interval a 1 such that 0 a 1 we use the notion of chebyshev blossoming in mu ntz spaces in order to show that the control polygon of the dimension elevation over a 1 can be obtained by a generalized de casteljau algorithm from the control polygon of the dimension elevation over the interval 0 1 the necessity of the mu ntz condition is proved with the aid of the bounded chebyshev inequality in mu ntz spaces although the initial steps of the proof of theorem 1 namely the proof of the theorem over the interval 0 1 appeared in our work in 3 4 we review here of all the steps of the proof in order to give a consistent presentation and show how we extended our methods to deal with the away from the origin case 2 chebyshev bernstein bases in mu ntz spaces throughout this work we will denote by r 0 0 r 1 rm an infinite sequence of strictly increasing real numbers for any integer n we denote by n the finite subsequence n r 0 0 r 1 rn and denote by e n span t r 0 1 tr 1 trn the associated mu ntz space to give an explicit expression for the chebyshev bernstein basis of the linear space e n over an interval a b we introduce the following definitions and terminology definition 1 a finite sequence of real numbers 1 2 n is termed a real partition if it satisfies 1 2 1 3 2 n n 1 n the generalized schur function indexed by a real partition is defined as the continuous extension of the function defined for pairwise distinct real values u 1 u 2 un by 14 s u 1 un det u j n j i 1 i j n 1 i j n ui uj we use the notation s u m 1 1 u m 2 2 u mk k to mean the evaluation of the generalized schur function in which the argument u 1 is repeated m 1 times 3 the argument u 2 is repeated m 2 times and so on when the elements of the finite sequence are positive integers we recover the classical notion of integer partitions whose associated schur functions s u 1 un are elements of the ring z u 1 un the value s 1 n can be computed for integer partitions using the hook length formula 17 or in general by the formula s 1 n 1 j k n j k j k n j 1 j 1 definition 2 for a finite sequence n r 0 r 1 rn of n 1 real num bers such that 0 r 0 r 1 rn we define the real partition 1 n n 1 associated with the finite sequence n by k rn rk 1 n k 1 for k 1 n 1 we also denote by 0 the real partition 0 2 3 n 1 termed the bottom partition of with the above definitions we can prove the following theorem 2 theorem 3 the chebyshev bernstein basis bn 0 n b n n n over an interval a b of the mu ntz space e n is given by bnk n t s 1 n 1 s 0 1 n bnk t s 0 a n k bk t 1 s a n k bk ab t s an 1 k bk s an k bk 1 where bnk is the classical bernstein basis of the polynomial space over the interval a b the real partition associated with n and 0 the bottom partition of 2 1 gelfond bernstein bases as pointwise limits of chebyshev bernstein bases let f be a smooth real function defined on an interval i for any real numbers x 0 x 1 xn in the interval i the divided difference x 0 xn f of the function f supported at the point xi i 0 n is recursively defined by x 0 f f x 0 and x 0 x 1 xn f x 1 xn f x 0 x 1 xn 1 f xn x 0 if n 0 consider now the function ft defined on 0 as ft x t x for t 0 x 0 f 0 0 1 f 0 x 0 for x 0 3 definition 3 for a finite sequence n 0 r 0 r 1 rn of strictly increas ing positive real numbers the gelfond bernstein basis of the mu ntz space e n with respect to the interval 0 1 is defined by hnk n t 1 n krk 1 rn rk rn ft for k 0 n 1 and hnn n t t rn where ft is the function defined in 3 4 the relation between the chebyshev bernstein basis and the gelfond bernstein basis of a given mu ntz space is given by the following theorem 3 theorem 4 let n 0 r 0 r 1 rn be a finite sequence of strictly increas ing real numbers we denote by bnk n k 0 n the chebyshev bernstein basis of the mu ntz space e n over an interval a 1 then for k 0 n and t 0 1 we have lim a 0 bnk n t h n k n t the proof of theorem 4 is based on applying to the explicit expression of the chebyshev bernstein bases in theorem 3 the following splitting formula for generalized schur functions if 1 k 1 h is a real partition then we have lim 0 s z 1 zk y 1 yh s z 1 zk s y 1 yh where and are the real partitions 1 k and 1 h and where denotes 1 2 h the proof also relies on the following inter esting connection between generalized schur functions and divided differences of the function ft in 3 namely for any finite sequence n 0 r 0 r 1 rn of strictly increasing real numbers we have r 0 r 1 rn ft 1 n r 1 r 2 rn 1 t n s 1 t n s 0 t n where is the real partition associated with the finite sequence n and 0 the bottom partition of 2 2 dimension elevation in mu ntz spaces over the interval 0 1 to express the corner cutting scheme associated with the dimension eleva tion of gelfond be zier curves we should express the gelfond bernstein basis of e n in terms of the gelfond bernstein basis of e n 1 such expression is given by the following proposition 3 proposition 1 for k 0 n and for any t 0 1 we have hnk n t rn 1 rk rn 1 hn 1 k n 1 t rk 1 rn 1 hn 1 k 1 n 1 t let p be an element of the mu ntz space e n written as p t n k 0 hnk n t pk m k 0 hmk m t b m k m n 4 by proposition 1 the control points bmk p m n k in 4 can be computed using the following corner cutting scheme for i 0 1 n we set p 0 i pi and for j 1 2 m n we construct iteratively new polygons p j 0 p j 1 p j n j using the inductive rule p j 0 p j 1 0 p j n j p j 1 n j 1 5 and for i 1 n j 1 p j i ri rn j p j 1 i 1 1 ri rn j p j 1 i 6 5 p 0 p 1 p 2 p 3 figure 1 the sequence of control polygons generated from 100 iterations of the corner cutting scheme 5 and 6 and parameters n 3 r 1 1 r 2 2 r 3 3 and ri 2 i for i 4 the red curve is the be zier curve associated with the control polygon p 0 p 1 p 2 p 3 when the real numbers ri are given by ri i for every index i then the corner cutting scheme 5 and 6 leads to the classical degree elevation algorithm in which it is well known that the limiting control polygon converges to the underlying be zier curve as m goes to infinity 16 consider the case where ri i for i 1 n and ri 2 i for i n figure 1 shows the generated polygons from 100 iterations with n 3 the figure clearly suggests the convergence of the generated polygons to the be zier curve with control points p 0 p 1 p 2 p 3 consider now the case where ri i for i 1 n while ri i 2 for i n figure 2 shows the obtained polygons after 100 iterations with n 3 it is clear from the figure that the limiting polygon does not converge to the be zier curve with control points p 0 p 1 p 2 p 3 now consider for example the limiting polygon of the corner cutting scheme 5 and 6 for the case n 3 and in which r 1 2 r 2 4 r 3 10 and ri 2 i 5 for i 3 figure 3 shows the generated polygons from 100 iterations and the gelfond be zier curve associated with the mu ntz space f span 1 tr 1 tr 2 tr 3 span 1 t 2 t 4 t 10 and control polygon p 0 p 1 p 2 p 3 the figure suggests that the limiting polygon converges to the gelfond be zier curve to exhibit the importance of the condition lims rs in the dimension elevation of gelfond be zier curves figure 4 shows the limiting polygon for the case n 3 r 1 1 r 2 2 r 3 3 and ri 4 1 i for i 3 the limiting polygon does not converge to the be zier curve with control polygon p 0 p 1 p 2 p 3 in fact we can prove the following theorem 4 theorem 5 the limiting polygon generated from a non constant polygon p 0 p 1 pn in rs s 1 using the corner cutting scheme 5 and 6 with respect to the sequence converges uniformly to the gelfond be zier curve associated with the mu ntz space e n and control polygon p 0 p 1 pn if and only if the real numbers ri satisfy the conditions lim s rs and i 1 1 ri for the rest of the paper we adopt the following notation for a given element p of the mu ntz space e n we denote by i p n 0 1 the gelfond be zier control points of p with respect to the interval 0 1 and we denote by 6 p 0 p 1 p 2 p 3 figure 2 the sequence of polygons generated from 100 iterations of the corner cutting scheme 5 and 6 and parameters n 3 r 1 1 r 2 2 r 3 3 and ri i 2 for i 4 the red curve is the be zier curve associated with the control polygon p 0 p 1 p 2 p 3 p 0 p 1 p 2 p 3 figure 3 the sequence of polygons generated from 100 iterations of the corner cutting scheme 5 and 6 and parameters n 3 r 1 2 r 2 4 r 3 10 and ri 2 i 5 for i 4 the red curve is the gelfond be zier curve associated with the mu ntz space span 1 t 2 t 4 t 10 and control polygon p 0 p 1 p 2 p 3 p 0 p 1 p 2 p 3 figure 4 the sequence of control polygons generated from 100 iterations of the corner cutting scheme 5 and 6 and parameters n 3 r 1 1 r 2 2 r 3 3 and ri 4 1 i for i 4 the red curve is the be zier curve associated with the control polygon p 0 p 1 p 2 p 3 7 i p n a 1 the chebyshev be zier control points of p with respect to the interval a 1 one of the main tool in proving theorem 5 and which will be needed later is the fact that for any element p of e n we have lim m p i tr 1 m 0 1 1 r 1 i p m 0 1 0 7 uniformly in i 3 dimension elevation over an interval a 1 given two intervals a 1 b 1 b 0 we can infer from the de castel jau algorithm of chebyshev be zier curves that for any element p of e n there exist real numbers s i j 0 1 j 0 n independent of p such that n j 0 s i j 1 and i p n a 1 n j 0 s i j j p n b 1 8 although the latter statement remains true for b 0 its proof is not obvious and requires the generalization of the notion of blossoming in mu ntz spaces over the interval 0 1 and the use of the relation between the gelfond bernstein bases and the chebyshev bernstein bases as stated in theorem 4 we have 3 theorem 6 let p be an element of the mu ntz space e n then for any i 0 1 n there exist real numbers s i j 0 1 j 0 n independent of p such that i p n a 1 n j 0 s i j j p n 0 1 with n j 0 s i j 1 using theorem 6 we can prove the following theorem theorem 7 under the mu ntz condition 2 on the sequence for any positive integer k m lim m i tr 1 m a 1 rk r 1 i trk m a 1 0 uniformly in i proof consider the parametric curve tr 1 trk over the interval a 1 since rk r 1 is the graph of a convex function as a parametric curve in the mu ntz space e with 0 r 1 rk it is thus located above its control polygon this remain true when considering as a parametric curve in e m as dimension elevation is a corner cutting scheme therefore we have for i 0 m i t r 1 m a 1 rk r 1 i trk m a 1 9 from theorem 6 we have i t r 1 m a 1 rk r 1 i trk m a 1 m j 0 s i j j t r 1 m 0 1 rk r 1 m j 0 s i j j t rk m 0 1 8 therefore by jensen inequality and inequality 9 we have 0 i tr 1 m a 1 rk r 1 i trk m a 1 m j 0 s i j j t r 1 m 0 1 rk r 1 j trk m 0 1 the proof is concluded upon using equation 7 corollary 1 under the mu ntz condition 2 on the sequence for any p e n and for any positive integer k m we have lim m p i tr 1 m a 1 1 r 1 i p m a 1 0 uniformly in i proof denote by p an element of e n given by p t n k 0 t rkak we have p i tr 1 m a 1 1 r 1 i p m a 1 n k 0 ak i tr 1 m a 1 rk r 1 i trk m a 1 we conclude the proof using theorem 7 using the widder hirschman gelfond theorem 1 10 we proved in 4 that the point set dm i tr 1 m 0 1 1 r 1 i 0 m form a dense subset of the interval 0 1 as m goes to infinity applying the generalized de casteljau algorithm to the function tr 1 to compute its control points over the interval a 1 for its control points over the interval 0 1 and using the density property of the point set dm we also have the following theorem 8 under the mu ntz condition 2 the point set dm i tr 1 m a 1 1 r 1 i 0 m form a dense subset of the interval a 1 as m goes to infinity we are now in a position to prove the main theorem 1 when the sequence satisfies the mu ntz condition 2 in this case if we denote by p an element of e n we have to show that given a point t a 1 and a sequence of real numbers im t t r 1 m a 1 1 r 1 that converges to t as m goes to infinity this is possible thanks to the density result in theorem 8 the point bm im t im t p m a 1 converges to p t as m goes to infinity uniformly on t we have max t p t bmim t maxt p t p im t t r 1 m a 1 1 r 1 max im t p im t t r 1 m a 1 1 r 1 bmim t the function p is continuous in the compact interval a 1 thus max t p t p im t t r 1 m a 1 1 r 1 0 as m 9 and corollary 1 shows that max im t p im t t r 1 m a 1 1 r 1 bmim t 0 as m this concludes the proof of the if part of theorem 1 remark 1 using equation 8 it can be proven that if the limiting polygon generated by the dimension elevation with respect to a sequence over an interval a b converges to the underlying chebyshev be zier curve then the limiting polygon over any interval c d a b also converges to the underlying curve to prove that the mu ntz condition 2 is necessary in theorem 1 we need the following bounded chebyshev inequality 1 8 5 theorem 9 bounded chebyshev s inequality let us assume that the sequence r 0 0 r 1 r 2 satisfies i 1 1 ri then for any real valued element p e and for each 0 there is a constant c 0 depending only on and and not on the number of terms in p and such that p 0 1 c p 1 1 10 to prove that the mu ntz condition 2 is necessary in theorem 1 we pro ceed as follows let p be a non constant element of e n expressed in the chebyshev bernstein basis over an interval a 1 as p t m i 0 bmi m t b m i m n without loss of generality we can assume that p a 6 0 otherwise we work on an interval b 1 such that a 1 b 1 and p b 6 0 and invoke remark 1 we have 2 p a bm 0 m a bm 0 b m 1 using the bounded chebyshev inequality 10 with 1 a we have bm 0 m a c bm 0 m a 1 c for any m n therefore lim m bm 0 b m 1 p a c 0 this shows that the dimension elevation leads to a limiting curve with a segment of non zero length as part of the curve thereby the limiting polygon cannot converge to the underlying chebyshev be zier curve 4 concluding remarks for a sequence of distinct real positive numbers r 0 0 r 1 rn with no monotonicity condition on the ri the space e is dense in c 0 1 if and only if 5 k 1 rk rk 2 1 11 10 gelfond be zier curves are too degenerate at the origin to study the dimension elevation algorithm in case we have no condition of monotonicity on the real numbers ri for instance if we consider the case n 3 r 1 1 r 2 2 r 3 3 and rj 1 j for j 3 and we start with a control polygon p 0 p 1 p 2 p 3 then the control polygon obtained by a dimension elevation to the order m is not obtained by a corner cutting scheme similar to 5 and 6 but instead the algorithm collapses the first m 3 control points to p 0 while the remaining con trol points are given by p 1 p 2 p 3 3 therefore an analogue formulation as in 11 for the dimension elevation in mu ntz spaces over 0 1 is unlikely how ever if we consider the dimension elevation algorithm of gelfond be zier curves away from the origin i e over an interval a 1 with a 0 then the gelfond bernstein basis coincides with the chebyshev bernstein basis the degeneracy at the origin disappears and the algorithm leads to a family of corner cutting schemes without imposing any condition of monotonicity on the real numbers ri unfortunately such family of corner cutting schemes involves rather com plicated coefficients expressed in term of generalized schur functions 2 it will be interesting to find for the away from the origin case conditions on the real number ri for the convergence of the dimension elevation algorithm to the un derlying curve in the theory of the density of mu ntz spaces over an interval a b with a 0 with no condition of positivity nor monotonicity on the pair wise distinct real numbers ri the corresponding mu ntz space is a dense subset of c a b if and only if the real numbers ri satisfy the so called full mu ntz condition 1 5 rk 6 0 1 rk 12 an interesting question is then let a b be an interval with a 0 and let ri be a sequence of pairwise distinct real numbers without any condition of positivity or monotonicity can we claim that the corresponding dimension elevation algorithm over a b converges to the underlying curve if and only if the sequence ri satisfies the full mu ntz condition 12 acknowledgments the author wishes to express his gratitude to professor marie laurence mazure for pointing out an error in the original submission of this work
