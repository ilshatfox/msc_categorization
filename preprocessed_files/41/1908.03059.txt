users traffic on two sided internet platforms qualitative dynamics victoria rayskin victoria rayskin tufts edu august 14 2019 abstract internet platforms traffic defines important characteristics of plat forms such as price of services advertisements speed of operations one can estimate the traffic with the traditional time series models like arima holt winters functional and kernel regressions when using these methods we usually want to smooth out noise and remove various external effects in the data and obtain short term predictions of processes however these models do not necessarily help us to understand the un derlying mechanism and the tendencies of the processes in this article we discuss the dynamical system approach to the mod eling which is designed to discover the underlying mechanism and the qualitative properties of the system s phase portrait we show how to reconstruct the governing differential equations from data the external effects are modeled as system s parameters initial conditions utiliz ing this new approach we construct the models for the volume of users interacting through internet platforms such as amazon com homes mil or wikipedia org then we perform qualitative analysis of the system s phase portrait and discuss the main characteristics of the platforms 1 introduction internet platforms become one of the most popular objects for our daily ac tivities there are many examples of interactions through platforms health exchange platforms connect health insurance providers subscribers bidding platforms connect auction buyers sellers real estate platforms connect renters home owners the 1000 genomes platform connects multi disciplinary re searchers the first three of these are examples of two sided platforms and the last example is the example of multi sided platform 10 4 the revision of some models and their analysis as well as the manuscript preparation were supported by aro grant w 911 nf 19 1 0399 1 ar x iv 1 90 8 03 05 9 v 2 ph ys ic s so c ph 1 3 a ug 2 01 9 users traffic is one of the most important characteristics of platforms for example it helps the platform owners to price the platform s services to predict platform s crashes due to high traffic and to plan platform development we discuss the dynamical systems approach for the study of the volume of users interacting through platforms our goal is to understand the platform specific rules that govern the inter net platform dynamics the new dynamical systems approach developed for platform analysis in 8 and 9 makes it now possible to develop strategies for increasing platforms efficiency furthermore in the study of multi sided platforms which becomes increas ingly important dynamical systems are very well suited for a high number of platform sides finally prediction of a platform s future behavior may be sensitive to noise external effects and platform s policies the dynamical systems approach allows one to associate changes in the external world with the changes in the trajec tories initial conditions also one can study regions of stability and other fundamental qualitative concepts less sensitive to external effects in section 3 we discuss a method for deriving differential equations of the process from the data there are numerous techniques for the short term pre dictions of the state variables of the process we demonstrate section 2 that approximation of the vector field instead of the state variables may result in more accurate predictions and in better understanding of the underlying pro cess the reconstructed vector field allows to perform qualitative analysis of the process and to understand the tendency of the process see sections 4 and 5 moreover we can switch between different trajectories of the dynamical system to reflect the changes in the external conditions in section 4 we provide examples of the reconstructed dynamical systems and perform qualitative analysis of the phase portraits in section 5 we discuss specific internet platform models and the characteris tics of the mechanism that governs the dynamics of these models in particular we compare the properties of the seller buyer type of platforms and plat forms like wikipedia we note that the competition between sellers as well as competition between buyers restricts grows of the number of users of a seller buyer type of platform while wikipedia s popularity can grow if there are no wars between contributors 2 vector field estimation vs flow estimation many laws of nature and human activities can be modeled with the help of differential equations frequently as illustrated with the next two examples it is easier to observe and discover these equations than their solutions at the end of 16 th century galileo galilei had studied the law of free fall according to his pupil vincenzo viviany galileo had dropped balls from the learning tower of pisa and recorded the data of his experiment 2 galileo galilei found that the velocity of the falling objects is proportional to their time of descent he formulated the law of free fall as the linear differential equation x t gt the trajectory solution of this equation is quadratic x t h 0 g 2 t 2 even though the tale about the learning tower of pisa may be apocryphal it would be harder to discover from the data that the hight x is proportional to the square of the elapsed time t then to discover the linear equation for the velocity if we turn our attention to the study of the physical systems meteorologi cal dynamics or chemical reactions that can be described with the help of the lorentz equations we will face complexity of the chaotic behavior the differen tial equations of this process are rather simple quadratic and easily discoverable with the modern techniques x 1 10 x 2 x 1 x 2 x 1 28 x 3 x 2 x 3 x 1 x 3 8 3 x 3 however if we try to describe the lorentz attractor trajectory corresponding to the solution of these equations we would not be able to write an explicit equation and would not be able to achieve high accuracy with approximations figure 1 lorentz attractor many processes for which the state variables equations cannot be explic itly written due to their complexity can be approximated with simple dif ferential equations which have very few non linear terms our goal is to study the complex processes with the help of differential equations that can be fitted into the data generated by the processes this approach allows to under stand the general laws governing the process to perform qualitative anal ysis of the system s phase portrait and depending on the external state to choose one of the initial value s trajectory for the short term prediction of the process comparing the short term prediction discussed above with the traditional time series model s prediction we found that the former method gives us higher accuracy consider for instance the quarterly data for 1955 1985 gross national prod uct gnp and money supply m 1 first let us use a traditional time series 3 figure 2 gnp and money supply quarterly data for 1955 1985 model since m 1 and gnp influence each other we can employ vector auto regression p cowpertwait and a metcalfe 3 suggest to use var of order 3 var 3 let us now assume that there exists gnp m 1 law and try to discover it from the data this law is affected by various external factors for example government regulations these externalities will shift the process from one tra jectory to another in the phase portrait which satisfy different initial conditions of the gnp m 1 law but the main governing forces of the law will remain un changed this is similar to the body moving in accordance with the law of free fall but slightly shifted from one initial value s solution to another by a strong wind using the quarterly data we can approximate the gnp m 1 law with the following dynamical system gnp 855 98 0114 gnp 3 79 m 1 000011 gnp 2 0038 m 12 00012 gnp m 1 m 1 164 69 0239 gnp 689 m 1 000008 gnp 2 0005 m 12 00003 gnp m 1 1 the vector field defined by 1 can be used for approximation of the solution for the short term prediction root mean square error of this approximation is smaller than the root mean square error of the var 3 method of 3 with the dynamical system approach we also obtain the equations which help us to understand how m 1 and gnp influence each other 3 techniques of reconstruction of the vector field from the data how to reconstruct dynamical systems from data we will follow the ideas of the sindy method developed by brunton proctor kutz 2 however instead of trying to reconstruct one single trajectory we will assume that the data comes from many different trajectories because the process is influenced by external effects and jumps from one initial value solution to another one we will try to reconstruct the vector field for some region of these trajectories accordingly we will use lasso ridge regression or a similar sparse re gression for the vector field approximation using the data points x tj here 4 tj 1 p are the moments of times when the state variables x tj were recorded we will approximate the vector field x tj x tj x tj 1 tj tj 1 by a linear combination of functions from the library l x lk x tj k p k j 1 here k is the number of functions included in the library l more specifically for an n dimensional system we want to find the optimal values a a ki k n k i 1 s th l x a approximates x t x i tj x i tj k lk x tj a ki the library l of candidate functions may consist of homogenious monoms trigonometric and or other simple functions the matrix a is sparse because we need only a few terms for the vector field approximation 4 examples of the vector field reconstruction in this section we consider several examples of differential equations recon structed precisely or approximately from data using the method discussed in section 3 these examples are related to the dynamics of the volume of users on internet platforms which we will present in section 5 our first example will be based on the data simulated by the system of differential equations x x y y y x 2 for the library l we will use monoms of order 5 and x y the lasso regression is capable of reconstructing the equations 2 precisely the reconstructed dynamical system can be analyzed the global properties can be described and the short term predictions can be performed starting at any ini tial condition the phase portrait of this system which has 1 basin of attraction with the attracting fixed point 1 1 is shown in figure 3 next we will simulate the data with the help of the linear system x x y y y x 3 theoretically this system is very simple however it has the whole diagonal of stationary points this singularity may cause problems with the traditional techniques for predicting future values of the process however if we try to reconstruct the differential equations from the simulated data using the same library l as in the last example we can recover the equations precisely and obtain the simple picture of the linear flow figure 4 5 figure 3 true and identified trajectories defined by the equations 2 all tra jectories in the basin of attraction 0 1 2 0 converge to 1 1 the trajectories initial conditions are shown as green squares figure 4 true and identified trajectories defined by the equations 3 all trajectories converge to the diagonal y x the trajectories initial conditions are shown as green squares 6 figure 5 trajectories of the true equations 4 and trajectories of the approxi mation of these equations with the system 5 there are 3 basins of attraction with the attracting stationary points 0 0 5 5 and 1 1 the trajectories initial conditions are shown as green squares clearly once we have discovered the linear nature of the process it is very easy to analyze this flow and to predict the future of the process in practice the functions which we include in the library l do not coincide with the functions or other mechanisms that generate the real process in the next example we will simulate the data with the help of the system which consists of the functions not included in our library x x y 1 4 sin 4 y y y x 1 4 sin 4 x 4 we will use the library of monoms of order 5 sin nx and cos nx n 1 13 the result of the lasso regression is the system of the differential equations x 2669 x 5 2845 y 5 3128 sin 3 x 2479 sin 3 y 3808 cos 3 x 2753 cos 3 y 0977 cos 5 x y 2669 y 5 6149 sin 3 x 3128 sin 3 y 7437 cos 3 x 3808 cos 3 y 9624 cos 5 x 0977 cos 5 y 5 even though the identified equations 5 differ from the true equations 4 it appears that the approximation of the trajectories is of high precision figure 5 7 5 dynamics of the volume of users on internet platforms in this section we will use the ideas of the differential equations approximation discussed in the sections 2 3 4 for the analysis of the traffic on internet platforms the estimates of the volume of platform users are important for the platform owners helping them to price the platforms services to predict the moments of high traffic which occasionally cause platform s crashes and to understand the long term future of platforms popularity we will focus on the examples of the dynamical system models for the two types of internet platforms those that involve interaction similar to the seller buyer relations and those that are similar to the wikipedia platform we will analyze tendency and global properties of the volume of users interacting through these platforms for more detailed analysis and proof of the results stated in this section see 8 and 9 the platforms discussed in this section are the two sided platforms they are characterized by two different types of users renters and home owners on homes mil sellers and buyers on amazon com readers and contributors on wikipedia org males and females on match com job seekers and employers on jobs com etc the volume of users in our model is a fraction of all theoretically possible users on each side of the platform we will denote them b and g for example b may represent the fraction of all possible buyers and g may represent the fraction of all possible sellers interacting through the amazon com platform and consider the following system b v g r b g w b s g b 0 1 g 0 1 here r b s g are the same side network effects and v g w b are the cross side network effects the same side network effect represents the interaction within the same type of users this effect can be positive s 0 1 0 negative s 0 1 0 or non existent s 0 the same for the r function the negative effect is typical for renters and buyers who want to keep costs low for home owners on homes mil sellers on amazon com job seekers on jobs com males or females on match com who prefer lower competition positive effect occurs between reviewers on yelp or gamers who share access tools on gaming platforms on a platform like wikipedia the same side network effect does not exist unless there are some edit wars between contributors first we will consider platforms with the negative same side network effect such as homes mil amazon com match com jobs com platforms with the negative same side network effect we call seller buyer type of platform then we discuss the wikipedia platform in all examples discussed below we approximate the same side network ef fects with linear functions 8 the cross side network effect represents users preferences and interest in the other type of users usually this effect is non negative therefore we assume it here and w 0 v 0 0 nobody wants to join the platform without presence of the opposite party time and range re scaling allow to assume that w v 0 1 0 1 we will call w and v the attachment functions 5 1 systems with negative same side network effect in this subsection we discuss the users traffic model for platforms with the negative same side network effect approximated by linear functions b and g b v g b g w b g 6 where b 0 1 g 0 1 1 and v w 0 1 0 1 v 0 w 0 0 it is easy to see that each trajectory defined by the equations 6 with its initial condition in the unit square 0 1 2 remains in the square and converges to a fixed point due to negative divergence in other words the model is well defined platform s population does not grow beyond 100 has no cyclic trajectories we will discuss the tendency convergence to the fixed points of the trajectories and other qualitative properties of the phase portrait of the system with various attachment functions the first example is the power attachment i e v g g w b b 1 7 because fixed points of the dynamical system 6 are located at the inter sections of v and w we draw them on the same graph figure 6 the phase portrait is shown in the figure 3 of section 4 it has one attracting fixed point at 1 1 the quadrant 0 1 2 0 is the basin of attraction we can conclude that with the power very strong cross side attachment all population tends to join the platform eventually many platforms can be characterized by step function attachments here for simplicity we show only 3 steps v g 0 g 0 25 1 2 g 25 75 1 g 75 1 w b 0 b 0 25 1 2 b 25 75 1 b 75 1 these functions are discontinuous and are inconvenient for the analysis more over it is natural to assume that these steps are smoothly connected possibly 9 figure 6 the power attachment functions the fixed points of the dynamical system defined by the equations 6 with the attachments expressed by the equations 7 are located at the intersections of the attachment functions at the origin and at the corner 1 1 this strong attachment attracts all theoret ically possible users eventually everybody joins the platform see figure 3 of section 4 figure 7 smoothed step attachment with 3 steps creates 3 attracting fixed points in the phase portrait of the dynamical system they are located in the 1 st 3 rd and 5 th points of intercept of the attachments the other 2 points of intercept are the hyperbolic fixed points of the dynamical system 10 via rapidly growing functions called here c 1 and c 2 thus we will consider smoothed step function attachments shown in figure 7 v g 0 g 0 25 c 1 g g 25 25 1 2 g 25 75 c 2 g g 75 75 1 g 75 1 8 a similar equation can be written for w b the phase portrait corresponding to the smoothed step attachment with 3 steps is illustrated by the figure 5 of section 4 it has 3 basins of attraction containing stable fixed points the basins are separated by separatrix passing through the 2 saddle fixed points see figure 8 conclusion 1 the model defined by the equations 6 with attachments ex pressed by the equations 8 has the dynamics shown in figure 8 it has the following properties if the volume of users is low within the low left basin all existing users tend to leave the platform eventually if the volume of users is in the middle basin of attraction the tendency of the volume is the middle fixed point if the level of users is high in the upper right basin the platform will eventually attract all population the jumps between the basins of attraction happen with the help of external effects for example the platform owner can offer some incentives or change the platform s policy to jump from the lower basin to the higher one a more general dynamics defined by the equations 6 can be described by the following theorem 1 suppose the two sided platform model described by the equa tions 6 is smooth and has finite number of fixed points then they are lo cated at b g 0 1 2 b v g g w b the fixed points are stable nodes saddles saddle nodes and stable spirals no repelling fixed points at least one eigenvalue has negative real part b 0 g 0 is a stable node spiral if and only if v g 0 w b 0 b 0 g 0 is a saddle if and only if v g 0 w b 0 b 0 g 0 belongs to center manifold if and only if v g 0 w b 0 moreover if v g 0 w b 0 1 v g 0 2 w b 0 6 0 then one of the branches of center manifold converges to b 0 g 0 but the other one diverges from this fixed point the proof of this result can be found in 9 11 figure 8 fixed points are denoted by red dots green separatrix passing through saddle fixed points separate 3 basins of attraction low volume of users in the low left basin eventually extinct if the volume of users is in the middle basin of attraction the tendency of the volume is to the middle fixed point if the level of users is in the upper right basin of attraction the platform will eventually attract all population 5 2 systems without the same side network effect the model for platforms without the same side network effect can be written as b v g g w b 9 where v w 0 1 0 1 and v 0 w 0 0 the flow has stationary point at the origin since attachment functions by def inition are non negative the number of users never declines on such platforms also because b and g never decrease there are no cycles applying these ideas to the general tendency of the popularity of wikipedia we can conclude that on the long run it should increase if there is no the same side competition the trajectories of the equations 9 satisfy v g dg w b db 0 10 if v and w vanish not only at the origin then non zero stationary points are formed and the flow of users converges to such point s from left and below while staying within the point s basins of attraction or the flow escapes the unit square if 0 is the only stationary point or the volume of users is either above the highest stationary point or to the right of the rightmost stationary point the trajectories would eventually escape the unit square 0 1 2 as shown in figure 9 thus we assume that either the negative interaction between the users of the 12 figure 9 if we assume that negative same side network effect is not present the volume of platform users does not decline unless it jumps to a lower trajectory due to policy changes for example however if the origin was the only fixed point as shown here the flow of users would escape the unit square same side must appear at some point and the model changes or there are some non zero stationary points with both b and g positive coordinates and the initial volume of user is below and to the left of some stationary point let us come back to the wikipedia example the authors of 7 5 1 6 discuss issues like edit wars between contributors and newcomer retention they also discuss some new policies re interpretations of the community rules and curating according to seniority this indicates some competition between contributors and possibly appearance of the negative same side network effect in this case the system becomes similar to the seller buyer system discussed in the section 5 1 then incentives provided to the contributors or some new policy can move the dynamics into a higher basin of attraction as discussed in conclusion 1 and increase the volume of contributors and readers the recent analysis of 6 shows that the number of wikipedia contributors declines if the edit wars are not fundamental characteristics of the wikipedia platform they can be viewed as a temporary external effects in this case the decline of the volume of users can possibly be explained as jumps from the higher trajectories to lower trajectory while the fundamental law governing the dynamics has no negative same side network effects and can be modeled with the equations 9 then the long term tendency of the trajectories is the growth of the number of users let us assume that the equations 9 describe the dynamics of the users volume of wikipedia as we noticed in this case v and w must vanish not only at the origin i e at some points gi bj 0 1 2 each side becomes indifferent to the opposite side v gi 0 and w bj 0 then gi bj are non zero stationary points since v g 0 on its domain gi must be a point of local minimum of v g and consequently v gi 0 similarly w bj 0 this implies that all non zero stationary points gi bj belong to the center manifolds which direct the flow north east as shown in 13 figure 10 if the attachment function v g has three zeros at 0 g 1 and g 2 and the attachment function w b has 3 zeros at 0 b 1 and b 2 the system has 9 sta tionary points shown in red color the flow of users with some positive volume of users on each side increases approaching one of the 4 non zero stationary points staying within some basin of attraction shown in green or escapes the unit square if the flow was above either b 2 or g 2 shown with dashed lines it would escape the unit square figure 10 some of the trajectories may be trapped between the center manifolds and converge to the stationary points while other trajectories escape the unit square in the latter case we assume that it takes very long time to escape the unit square during a reasonably long time the volume of users does not grow beyond 100 conclusion 2 the platform modeled with the help of equations 9 has the following properties on the long run the volume of users does not decrease a temporary decline of the volume of users may be due to external effects this corresponds to the jumps from the higher trajectories to the lower trajectories of the governing equations references 1 i beschastnikh t kriplean d w mcdonald
