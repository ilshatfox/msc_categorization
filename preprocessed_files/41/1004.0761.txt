edu tw september 3 2018 abstract this is the fourth paper of our study of the shape parameter c contained in the fa mous multiquadrics 1 c 2 x 2 0 and the inverse multiquadrics c 2 x 2 0 the theoretical ground is the same as that of 10 however we extend the space of interpolated functions to a more general one this leads to a totally different set of criteria of choosing c keywords radial basis function multiquadric shape parameter interpolation 1 introduction again we are going to adopt the radial function h x 2 c 2 x 2 2 r 2 n 0 c 0 1 where x is the euclidean norm of x in rn is the classical gamma function and c are constants this definition looks more complicated than the ones mentioned in the abstract however it will simplify the fourier transform of h and our analysis of some useful results in order to make this paper more readable we review some basic ingredients mentioned in the previous papers at the cost of wasting a few pages for any interpolated function f our interpolating function will be of the form s x n i 1 cih x xi p x 2 where p x pm 1 the space of polynomials of degree less than or equal to m 1 in rn x x 1 xn is the set of centers interpolation points for m 0 pm 1 0 we require that s interpolate f at data points x 1 f x 1 xn f xn this results in a linear system of the form n i 1 cih xj xi q i 1 bipi xj f xj j 1 n 3 1 http arxiv org abs 1004 0761 v 1 n i 1 cipj xi 0 j 1 q to be solved where p 1 pq is a basis of pm 1 this linear system is solvable because h x is conditionally positive definite c p d of order m max 2 0 where 2 denotes the smallest integer greater than or equal to 2 besides the linear system another important object is the function space each function of the form 1 induces a function space called native space denoted by ch m rn abbreviated as ch m where m denotes its order of conditional positive definiteness for each member f of ch m there is a seminorm f h called the h norm of f the definition and characterization of the native space can be found in 4 5 7 11 12 and 14 in this paper all interpolated functions belong to the native space although our interpolated functions are defined in the entire rn interpolation will occur in a simplex the definition of simplex can be found in 3 a 1 simplex is a line segment a 2 simplex is a triangle and a 3 simplex is a tetrahedron with four vertices let tn be an n simplex in r n and vi 1 i n 1 be its vertices then any point x tn can be written as convex combination of the vertices x n 1 i 1 civi n 1 i 1 ci 1 ci 0 the numbers c 1 cn 1 are called the barycentric coordinates of x for any n simplex tn the evenly spaced points of degree l are those points whose barycentric coordinates are of the form k 1 l k 2 l kn 1 l ki nonnegative integers with n 1 i 1 ki l it s easily seen that the number of evenly spaced points of degree l in tn is exactly n dimpnl n l n where pnl denotes the space of polynomials of degree not exceeding l in n variables moreover such points form a determining set for pnl as is shown in 2 in this paper the evaluation argument x will be a point in an n simplex and the set x of centers will be the evenly spaced points in that n simplex 2 fundamental theory before introducing the main theorem we need to define two constants definition 2 1 let n and be as in 1 the numbers and 0 are defined as follows a suppose n 3 let s n 3 2 then i if 0 3 s 3 and 0 2 s 1 s 3 2 ii if 0 1 s 2 2 3 and 0 2 m 2 s 2 m 1 s 2 m 3 2 m 2 where m 2 2 b suppose n 3 n 1 then 1 and 0 1 c suppose n 1 let s n 3 2 then 1 and 0 1 2 m 2 2 m 1 2 m s 3 where m 2 the following theorem is the cornerstone of our theory we cite it directly from 6 with a slight modification to make it easier to understand theorem 2 2 let h be as in 1 for any positive number b 0 let c max 2 3 b 0 8 and 0 1 3 c for any n simplex q of diameter r satisfying 1 3 c r 2 3 c note that 2 3 c b 0 if f ch m f x s x 2 n 7 4 n 1 4 n nc 2 l 0 3 c 1 f h 4 holds for all x q and 0 0 where s x is defined as in 2 with x 1 xn the evenly spaced points of degree l in q satisfying 1 3 c l 2 3 c the constant n denotes the volume of the unit ball in rn and 0 1 is given by 2 3 1 3 c which only in some cases mildly depends on the dimension n remark a note that the right hand side of 4 approaches zero as 0 this is the key to understanding theorem 2 2 the number is in spirit equivalent to the well known fill distance although the centers x 1 xn are not purely scattered the shape of the simplex is controlled by us hence the distribution of the centers is practically quite flexible b in 4 the shape parameter c plays a crucial role and greatly influences the error bound this provides us with a theoretical ground of choosing the optimal c however we need further work before presenting useful criteria in this paper all interpolated functions belong to a kind of space defined as follows definition 2 3 for any positive number e f l 2 rn f 2 e 2 d where f denotes the fourier transform of f for each f e its norm is f e f 2 e 2 d 1 2 the following lemma is cited from 9 lemma 2 4 let h be as in 1 for any 0 if 0 n 1 and n 1 0 then e ch m rn and for any f e the seminorm f h of f satisfies f h 2 n 1 4 n 1 4 c 1 n 4 n 1 2 ec 2 1 2 f e where c c 2 2 4 n 1 4 3 corollary 2 5 under the conditions of theorem 2 2 if f e 0 n 1 and n 1 0 4 can be transformed into f x s x 2 3 n 4 2 34 n 12 n n 0 3 cc n 1 4 l 4 n 1 2 ec 2 1 2 1 f e 5 where c c 2 2 4 n 1 4 proof this is an immediate result of theorem 2 2 and lemma 2 4 note that corollary 2 5 covers the very useful case 1 n 2 however the case 1 n 1 is excluded for this case we need a different approach lemma 2 6 let 0 1 and n 1 for any f e f h 2 n 1 4 1 1 ln 2 2 3 m c 1 2 f e where m c e 1 1 c 2 if c 2 3 and m c g c c 2 2 4 4 if c 2 3 where g c ec 2 proof this is just theorem 2 5 of 9 corollary 2 7 let 0 1 and n 1 under the conditions of theorem 2 2 if f e 4 can be transformed into f x s x 2 3 n 4 2 n 5 4 n n 0 3 cc 2 l 1 ln 2 2 3 m c 1 2 1 f e 6 where m c is defined as in lemma 2 6 proof this is an immediate result of theorem 2 2 and lemma 2 6 now we have dealt with the most useful cases for 0 the next step is to treat 0 lemma 2 8 let 0 0 and n 1 for any f e f h d 0 c 1 n 4 1 n 2 ec e 2 1 2 f e where c c 2 2 4 1 n 4 and d 0 is a constant depending on n only proof this is just theorem 2 8 of 9 corollary 2 9 let 0 0 and n 1 if f e 4 can be transformed into f x s x 2 n 7 4 n 1 4 n n 0 3 cd 0 c 1 n 4 l 4 1 n 2 ec e 2 1 2 1 f e 7 where d 0 are as in lemma 2 8 proof this is an immediate result of theorem 2 2 and lemma 2 8 4 3 criteria of choosing c note that in 5 6 and 7 there is a main function of c as in 9 let s call this function the mn function denoted by mn c and its graph the mn curve the optimal choice of c is then the number minimizing mn c however unlike 9 the range of c is the entire interval 0 rather than a proper subset of 0 we now begin our criteria case 1 0 n 1 and n 1 0 let f e and h be as in 1 under the con ditions of theorem 2 2 for any fixed satisfying 0 0 the optimal value of c in 0 is the number minimizing mn c c n 1 4 l 4 n 1 2 ec 2 1 2 where c c 2 2 4 n 1 4 reason this is a direct consequence of 5 remark a it s easily seen that mn c as c also if n 1 0 mn c as c 0 b case 1 covers the frequently seen case 1 n 2 c the number c minimizing mn c can be easily found by mathematica or matlab numerical results 3 4 5 6 7 8 c 0 02 0 03 0 04 0 05 0 06 mnhcl graph of the mn curve with 0 01 and l 5 figure 1 here n 2 1 1 and b 0 1 5 3 4 5 6 7 8 c 0 004 0 006 0 008
