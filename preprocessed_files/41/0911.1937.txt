rehovot 76100 israel e mail yosef yomdin weizmann ac il abstract the classical remez inequality bounds the maximum of the absolute value of a polynomial p x of degree d on 1 1 through the maximum of its absolute value on any subset z of positive measure in 1 1 similarly in several variables the maximum of the absolute value of a polynomial p x of degree d on the unit cube qn 1 rn can be bounded through the maximum of its absolute value on any subset z qn 1 of positive n measure the main result of this paper is that the n measure in the remez inequality can be replaced by a certain geometric invariant d z which can be effectively estimated in terms of the metric entropy of z and which may be nonzero for discrete and even finite sets z http arxiv org abs 0911 1937 v 1 1 introduction the classical remez inequality 32 bounds the maximum of the absolute value of a polynomial p x of degree d on 1 1 through the maximum of its absolute value on any subset z of positive measure in 1 1 more accurately let p x be a polynomial of degree d then for any measurable z 1 1 max 1 1 p x td 4 max z p x 1 1 where 1 z is the lebesgue measure of z and td x cos d arccos x is the d th chebyshev polynomial in several variables the generalization of 1 1 was obtained in 10 theorem 1 1 let b rn be a convex body and let b be a measurable set then for any real polynomial p x p x 1 xn of degree d we have sup b p td 1 1 1 n 1 1 1 n sup p 1 2 here n n b with n being the lebesgue measure on r n this inequality is sharp and for n 1 it coincides with the classical remez inequality it is well known that the inequality of the form 1 1 or 1 2 may be true also for some sets z of measure zero and even for certain discrete or finite sets z let us mention here only a couple of the most relevant results in this direction in 2 3 12 26 31 38 39 such inequalities are provided for z being a regular grid in 1 1 in 3 trigonometric polynomials are considered let us mention 1 where a dual problem is considered of interpolation by polynomials of degree higher than the number of the nodes in 14 discrete sets z 1 1 are studied see section 2 2 below an invariant z d is defined and estimated in some examples which is the best constant in the remez type inequality of degree d for the couple z 1 1 below in definition 1 1 we call this invariant extended to any dimension the remez d span of z and denote it rd z on the other hand recently in 9 remez inequality has been extended for complex polynomials of n variables to subsets z of positive hausdorff 1 s measure s 2 n 2 here 2 n 2 is the real dimension of a zero set of such a polynomial so the result has a natural geometric interpretation remez type inequalities are true for z having hausdorff dimension larger than the dimension of the corresponding zero sets for real polynomials of n variables under the above assumption on z an integral version of the remez inequality was proved in 9 and a question was posed of the existence of a strong remez type inequality of the form 1 2 in 7 estimates have been obtained for covering numbers of sub level sets of families of analytic functions depending analytically on a parameter using these estimates strong remez type inequalities have been proved for the restrictions of analytic functions to certain fractal sets the existence of such inequalities was conjectured in 9 in 6 28 30 analytic and quasi analytic functions have been studied from a similar point of view for one complex variable results similar to remez inequality are provided by the classical cartan lemma see for example 17 13 and references therein let p z be a monic polynomial of one complex variable of degree d for any given 0 consider v d p z c p z d then v d p can be covered by at most d complex discs dj with radii rj j 1 d such that d j 1 rj 2 e in 40 see also 41 a generalization of the cartan lemma to plurisub harmonic functions was obtained which leads in particular to the bounds on the size of sub level sets similar to those obtained in 9 in the present paper we would like to address a general problem of char acterizing sets z for which remez type inequality is valid having this in mind let us give the following definition definition 1 1 a set z qn 1 rn is called d definite if any real polynomial p x p x 1 xn of degree d bounded in absolute value by 1 on z is bounded in absolute value by a certain constant c d z not depending on p on qn 1 the minimum rd z of all such constants c d z is called the remez d span of z in view of the above mentioned results the following problem looks natural and important 2 characterize through their metric geometry all the sets z qn 1 rn with the finite remez d span rd z and compute rd z for such z in geo metric terms in principle there is a very simple answer to this question rd z if and only if z is contained in a zero set of a certain nonzero polynomial p of degree d indeed in the opposite case supz p and supqn 1 p both are norms on the finite dimensional space of polynomials of degree d however in general it is not easy to reformulate this condition in effective geometric terms and to provide explicit bounds on rd z starting with an explicitly given z for finite sets z it is possible in principle to write an explicit answer through the interpolation systems see for example 18 27 16 and references therein but to analyze for instance the asymptotic behavior of rd z as d for a fractal z may be a tough problem compare 14 and section 2 2 below in the present paper we construct for subsets z qn 1 a simple geometric invariant d z which we call a metric d span of z the metric d span d z can be effectively estimated in terms of the metric entropy of z and it may be nonzero for discrete and even finite sets z our main result is that the n measure in the remez type inequality 1 2 can be replaced by d z to define d z let us recall that the covering number m a of a metric space a is the minimal number of closed balls covering a see 19 21 22 25 below a will be subsets of rn equipped with the l metric so the balls in this metric are the cubes qn for a polynomial p on rn let us consider the sub level set v p defined by v p x qn 1 p x the following result is provided by 33 34 20 theorem 1 2 vitushkin s bound for v v p as above m v n 1 i 0 ci n d 1 i n v 1 n 1 3 with ci n d c i n 2 d n i for n 1 we have m v d 1 v 1 and for n 2 we have m v 2 d 1 2 8 d 1 2 v 1 2 3 for 0 we denote by mn d or shortly md the polynomial of degree n 1 in 1 as appears in 1 3 md n 1 i 0 ci n d 1 i 1 4 in particular m 1 d d m 2 d 2 d 1 2 8 d 1 now for each subset z qn 1 possibly discrete or finite we introduce the metric n d span of z via the following definition definition 1 2 let z be a subset in qn 1 rn then the metric n d span or shortly d span d z is defined as d z sup 0 n m z md 1 5 now we are ready to state the main result of this paper which in particular provides a partial answer to the above stated general problem of describing sets with finite remez d span theorem 1 3 if d z 0 then rd z is finite and satisfies rd z r td 1 1 1 n 1 1 1 n 1 6 where td x cos d arccos x is the d th chebyshev polynomial this theorem is proved in section 2 via a combination of inequalities 1 2 and 1 3 the last being reinterpreted as in theorem 2 1 below the bound in 1 6 is finite if and only if 0 as an immediate corollary of definition 1 2 and theorem 1 3 we obtain the following general condition for positivity of d z corollary 1 the d span d z is positive if and only if for certain 0 we have m z md 4 corollary 1 establishes finiteness of rd z for a large class of sets first of all this is true for z having a hausdorff dimension dimh z greater than n 1 together with an explicit bound given in section 3 below this provides a partial answer to the question posed in 9 of existence in this case of a remez type inequality of the form 1 2 in fact we can replace the hausdorff dimension by the entropy or the box dimension dime z the entropy dimension is defined in terms of the asymptotic behavior of the covering number m z as tends to 0 it is larger and often strictly larger than the hausdorff dimension and it may take any value up to n also for countable subsets of rn however corollary 1 shows finiteness of rd z also for sufficiently large sets of dimension exactly n 1 corollary 2 let z be a c 1 hypersurface in qn 1 with n 1 z cn 1 n d then z is d definite by the virtue of the covering number also sufficiently dense finite subsets of d definite sets are themselves d definite thus corollary 1 provides a class of examples of finite d definite subsets z bn 1 roughly those are sufficiently dense finite subsets of sets of dimension n 1 or higher it is important to analyze the behavior of the remez d span rd z for finite and general sets z in terms of their metric structure here an ap propriate invariant may be the so called spread introduced in 36 37 a very closely related notion is the weight of a minimal spanning trees see 23 and references therein some initial results in this direction are given in section 3 2 6 below let us stress that the sufficient condition for a set z to be d definite provided by corollary 1 is not necessary in general any small piece w of an irreducible algebraic hypersurface w in rn of degree d 1 d is d definite since it is not contained in any algebraic hypersurface of degree d the same is true for transcendental hypersurfaces w as well as for transcendental or algebraic of high degree sets w of smaller dimensions in particular for curves on the other hand in each of these situations if we take a sufficiently small piece w of w inside the unit cube the n 1 area n 1 w of w is much less than cn 1 n d consequently m w n 1 w 1 n 1 is 5 always strictly less than cn 1 n d 1 n 1 therefore by corollary 1 we have d w 0 this stresses once more the importance and apparent difficulty of the problem of a geometric characterization of the d definite sets the behavior of polynomials on discrete sets plays an important role in the whitney problem of extension of differentiable functions from closed sets 35 in particular there is an apparent relation of the remez type inequal ities with the problem of extending finite differences to higher dimensions see 5 11 15 for some results representing recent progress in the whitney problem the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we prove theorem 1 3 and state in a simplified form some of the main results describing the behavior of the d span in specific situations the proofs of these results are postponed till section 3 where they are given with all the required details and accurate but somewhat cumbersome constants the author would like to thank a brudnyi v katsnelson b nadler and m sodin for useful discussions and for providing important references and the referee for suggesting significant improvements of the presentation 2 proof of theorem 1 3 and some basic ex amples of d definite sets the following theorem relates the n volume of the sub level sets v of a polynomial of degree d with the metric d n span d z of subsets z v theorem 2 1 let p x p x 1 xn be a polynomial of degree d and let z qn 1 be a given set then if z v p for a certain 0 then we have n v p d z where n denotes as above the lebesgue n measure proof this fact follows directly from the vitushkin bound on the covering number of the sub level sets v given in theorem 1 2 above for any polyno mial p x p x 1 xn of degree d for z v p and for any 0 we 6 have m z m v p md n v p 1 n consequently for any 0 we have n v p n m z md 2 1 and we can take a supremum with respect to this completes the proof proof of theorem 1 3 assume that p is bounded in absolute value by 1 on z then we have z v 1 p by theorem 2 1 n v 1 p d z now since p is bounded in absolute value by 1 on v 1 p by definition we can apply the yu brudnyi ganzburg inequality theorem 1 1 above with b qn 1 and v 1 p this completes the proof let us now study some specific classes of z theorem 2 2 a set z qn 1 of positive s hausdorff measure s n 1 is d definite for any d proof this follows directly from theorem 3 2 section 3 below where also a lower bound for d z is given the invariant d is strong enough to prove that sets of dimension exactly n 1 are definite assuming their n 1 hausdorff measure is big enough theorem 2 3 a set z qn 1 with n 1 hausdorff measure hn 1 z sat isfying hn 1 z 2 nn 1 cn 1 n d is d definite in particular any curve z q 21 of the length l z satisfying l z 16 2 d is d definite proof this follows directly from corollary 4 section 3 below where also a lower bound for d z is given 2 1 bounding remez d span via minimal spanning trees let us now consider finite sets z by virtue of the definitions any sufficiently dense finite subset of a set with positive d span also has positive d span see theorem 3 4 of section 3 below specifying the choice of such a dense finite subset in each of the cases considered above one result addressing the specific geometry of z is the following the distance below is with respect to the l norm on rn 7 theorem 2 4 let a degree d and a finite subset z qn 1 be given and let 0 be the minimal distance between the points of z assume that z p md 0 then the set z is d definite in particular any set with more than d points in q 11 is d definite any set z q 21 with the number of points larger than 2 d 1 2 8 d 1 0 is d definite proof this follows from definition 1 2 since m o z z p remark let us stress the importance of the assumption z qn 1 in theorem 2 4 without it we could take all the points of z on the same straight line however inside the cube qn 1 the points of z must form an essentially n dimensional configuration in order to satisfy the inequality z md 0 following the direction of theorem 2 4 we can analyze in a more system atic way the behavior of d span of finite and general sets z in terms of the mutual distances between the points of z this can be done in terms of the so called spread introduced in 36 37 a very closely related notion is the weight of minimal spanning trees see 23 and references therein some results in this direction are given in section 3 2 6 below 2 2 examples in one dimension and the favard bound we complete the present section with writing down explicitly the resulting bounds for some one dimensional sets z let us start with a regular grid theorem 2 5 let d be given and let g 1 s x 1 1 x 2 xs 1 be a regular grid in 1 1 s d then rd g 1 s td 4 where 2 s d s 1 in particular rd g 1 s is finite for s d and it tends to 1 for s proof it follows from the bounds on d g 1 s computed in example 1 sec tion 3 the result of theorem 2 5 was obtained by a different method in 39 38 in section 3 1 below we compute d z for z zr 1 12 r 1 3 r 1 kr we get d zr rr r 1 r 1 1 dr in particular for r 1 i e for z 1 1 12 1 3 1 k we get d z 1 14 d 8 now for for 0 q 1 and for z q 1 q q 2 q 3 qm computa tions in section 3 1 give d z q q d log 1 q substituting these expressions for the d span into the expression of the orem 1 3 we obtain theorem 2 6 for the sets zr and z q as above rd zr rd td 2 where rr r 1 r 1 1 dr or q d log 1 q respectively for d we have rd 4 r 1 r 1 rr ddrd or rd 4 log 1 q d 1 q d 2 respectively in particu lar rd z 1 24 ddd rd z 1 2 2 d 2 2 d in 14 slightly better bounds are given in the last two examples rd z 1 2 d d rd z 1 2 d 1 2 d 2 3 d 2 2 favard s method for bounding rd z is to fix d 1 points z and to estimate the corresponding interpolation polynomial of degree d this produces the following general bound 14 rd z inf x 1 xd 1 z d 1 i 1 1 a x 1 xd 1 xi 2 2 where ax 1 xd 1 x d 1 j 1 x xj unfortunately we cannot expect favard s approach to produce realistic bounds on rd z for general one dimensional z 1 1 the problem is that considering polynomials of degree d we analyze the finite subsets in z containing exactly d 1 points and therefore we cannot take into account the influence of the rest of the set z in the examples zr and z q considered above this method works well since for each d the first d 1 points of these sets give a sufficiently accurate approximation of the entire set however for a uniform grid g 1 s s d a straightforward application of the favard estimate gives rd g 1 s 2 e d the minimum in 2 2 being achieved on the 9 approximately uniform sub grid formed by d 1 points in g 1 s and this bound does not depend on s at all our bound given by theorem 2 6 which in this case is sharp up to a constant shows that rd g 1 s for any fixed degree d indeed tends to 1 as s increases remark it is an interesting problem to investigate the asymptotic behavior of rd z as d for fractal sets z in one and several dimensions the examples above give some hope that the metric d spread being a rather coarse metric invariant still provides an adequate tool for this problem on the other hand as it was mentioned above there are d definite sets z for which d z 0 as for a regular grid gns with the step 1 s in the unit cube qn 1 we notice that the following inequality is true lemma 2 1 for each n rd g n s rd g 1 s n proof induction by the dimension 3 more examples of d definite sets in this section we consider in somewhat more details properties of the d span and present more examples stressing the question of positivity of d z in particular we provide the proofs of theorems 2 2 and 2 3 and of some results used in section 2 2 above 3 1 some one dimensional examples for n 1 the sub level set v v p 1 1 is just a finite union of closed intervals the maximal possible number of these intervals is d degp clearly the covering number m v satisfies m v d 1 v 1 in agreement with theorem 1 2 above we get proposition 3 1 for a set z 1 1 d z sup 0 m z d this immediately implies corollary 3 for z d we have d z 0 for z d the d span d z is strictly positive 10 in fact the following more accurate bound can be given proposition 3 2 let z p d and let 0 be the minimal distance between the points of z then the d span d z satisfies the inequality d z 0 p d proof we have m 0 z p in section 3 3 5 below we generalize this last remark to higher dimensions let us give now some initial specific examples where the d span can be explicitly estimated example 1 let gs x 1 1 x 2 xs 1 be a regular grid in 1 1 the covering number m gs is 2 1 for 2 s 1 and it is s for 2 s 1 therefore the function m gs d behaves as 2 d for 2 s 1 and it is s d for 2 s 1 as corollary 3 above shows for s d we get d gs 0 for s d the supremum is achieved for 2 s 1 and we get d gs 2 s d s 1 notice that d gs tends to the total length of 1 1 as s grows or as the density of the set gs inside 1 1 increases example 2 let zr 1 12 r 1 3 r 1 kr an easy computation shows that m zr 1 1 r 1 hence d zr sup 0 m zr d sup 0 1 1 r 1 d rr r 1 r 1 1 dr the supremum being attained for r r 1 r 1 dr 1 in particular for z 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 k we get d z 1 14 d the supremum being attained for 1 4 d 2 example 3 let for 0 q 1 z q 1 q q 2 q 3 qm computa tions as above give d z q q d log 1 q as for sharpness of these bounds we show it via theorem 2 1 above which claims that for a sublevel set v v p containing z we have v d z now the sets of the form v p are exactly all the sets containing at most d intervals therefore if we can cover z by d intervals of a total length a then by theorem 2 1 we have d z a in example 1 let us cover the grid gs with d intervals each containing s d consecutive points there are d 1 gaps of the length 2 s 1 between these 11 intervals so their total length is 2 2 d 1 s 1 2 s d s 1 so the bound above is sharp in example 2 we can easily find a covering of the set zr with d intervals of the total length 1 dr indeed take first d 1 intervals of a small length each covering exactly one point from 1 1 2 r 1 3 r 1 d 1 r the rest of the set zr we cover by one interval of the length 1 dr so also here the bound above is sharp up to a constant the same is true also in example 3 3 2 higher dimensions let us start with some simple general properties of the d span certainly this geometric invariant is stronger than the usual n measure n proposition 3 3 for a measurable subset z bn 1 the d span d z satisfies d z n z proof take 0 in definition 1 2 notice that md grows at most as 1 n 1 and use the fact that if we can cover z by m z disjoint cubes then m z z n 3 2 1 sets of positive s hausdorff measure n 1 s n the result above can be generalized to sets of fractal hausdorff measures let us recall that for 0 the hausdorff measure of z is defined as h z lim 0 h z where h z is the lower bound of all the sums of the form i 1 r i ri and z i 1 ai with the diam ai ri see e g 19 however in case s n we need more geometric information on our set z and not only the positivity of its s hausdorff measure hs z to conclude that the volume of any simple semi algebraic set containing z is large indeed think about a long but rapidly oscillating curve inside a small ball in the plane what we need is a kind of an injectivity radius 0 of z for which the covering 0 balls are almost disjoint let us give the following definition 12 definition 3 1 let hs z 0 we define the s injectivity radius 0 s z as the maximal such that h s z 12 hs z for all now we can compare the covering number and the s hausdorff measure proposition 3 4 for 1 n 0 s z we have m z 12 nshs z 1 s proof by definition of 0 s z and of h s z we have for any covering of z by m z cubes m z n s 1 2 hs z hence m z 1 2 ns hs z 1 s let us fix n and d we fix also a certain s n 1 0 we can prove now a general lower bound for the d span of sets z with positive hausdorff s measure let us introduce some notations as above we have md c 0 n d c 1 n d 1 cn 1 n d 1 n 1 where the constants c 0 n d cn 1 n d depending only on n d have been defined in theorem 1 2 above for small the leading term of degree n 1 in 1 in md determines the asymptotic behavior of this expression so let us define 1 1 d as the maximal such that md 2 cn 1 n d 1 n 1 for all finally for any h 0 let us put 2 2 h d h 8 cn 1 n d ns 1 now we are ready to state the result theorem 3 1 let s n 1 0 and let z qn 1 satisfy hs z h 0 then d z 1 4 1 hs z here min 1 d 2 h d proof by definition d z sup 0 e m z md e m z md 3 1 by the choice of and by proposition 3 4 we have m z 1 2 ns hs z 1 s while md 2 cn 1 n d 1 n 1 since 1 d therefore m z md 1 2 ns hs z 1 s 2 cn 1 n d 1 n 1 3 2 13 finally the condition that 2 h d h 8 cn 1 n d ns 1 implies that the right hand side of 3 2 is not smaller than 1 4 ns hs z 1 s combining this last inequality with 3 1 and 3 2 we obtain the required bound remark an important feature of theorem 3 1 is that we do not need to assume that the s hausdorff measure of z is large just the fact that hs z 0 implies d z 0 to stress the dependence of the bound of theorem 3 1 on s and hs z let us assume that the radius of injec tivity 0 s z is large while the measure h hs z is small then min 1 d 2 h d 2 h d c d s h 1 and therefore by theorem 3 1 d z c 1 h 1 this bound blows up as 0 or s n 1 being quite effective the bound of theorem 3 1 is not sharp compare 7 8 however for s exactly equal to n 1 there is still a possibility to bound d z from below if hs z is strictly greater than 2 nn 1 cn 1 n d this bound is obtained in corollary 4 in section 3 2 4 below 3 2 2 sets with large covering number the following result is parallel to theorem 3 1 but it replaces the assumption of positivity of hs z with the assumption that the covering number m z grows as cs 1 s s n 1 for sufficiently small we preserve essentially the same notation as in theorem 3 1 define the s covering injectivity radius 0 s z as the maximal such that m z 1 2 cs 1 s for all the parameter 1 1 d is defined exactly as above and we put e 2 cs d cs cn 1 n d 1 s theorem 3 2 let s n 1 0 and let z qn 1 satisfy m z cs 1 s for all sufficiently small then d z 1 4 1 cs here min 0 s z 1 d 2 cs d proof exactly the same as for theorem 3 1 remark as above if e 2 cs d cs cn 1 n d 1 s then we get d z 1 4 1 8 cn 1 n d 1 c 1 s 14 notice also that theorem 3 2 formally implies theorem 3 1 because of propo sition 3 4 however since the hausdorff measure is probably a somewhat more natural invariant than the covering number it looks preferable to sep arate these two statements 3 2 3 entropy and hausdorff dimension we recall here the notions of the entropy and the hausdorff dimensions definition 3 2 let a x be a bounded subset in a metric space x 1 dime a inf k such that for each 0 n a k 1 is called the entropy dimension of a 2 dimh a inf s a is called the hausdorff dimension of a the notion of the entropy dimension appears in fractal geometry under many different names in particular minkowski dimension probably the most justified historically capacity dimension box dimension it is well known see for example 19 that for any set a we have dimea dimh a in particular for countable sets a always dimh a 0 while dimea may take any value the bounds of theorems 3 1 and 3 2 imply the following proposition 3 5 for any d and for any subset z bn 1 if dime z n 1 then d z 0 in particular this is true if dimh z n 1 3 2 4 sets of dimension n 1 now we consider the case s n 1 here we start with the covering number and obtain the corresponding result for the hausdorff measure as a corollary let m z c 1 n 1 for 0 n 1 with c cn 1 n d we define 1 d c as the largest for which md q c d 1 n 1 for all here q c d cn 1 n d 1 2 c cn 1 n d theorem 3 3 let z qn 1 satisfy m z c 1 n 1 for 0 n 1 with c cn 1 n d then d z 1 2 c cn 1 n d where min 0 n 1 1 c d 15 proof exactly as in theorem 3 1 via proposition 3 4 we obtain corollary 4 let z bn 1 satisfy hn 1 z 2 nn 1 cn 1 n d then d z 1 2 c cn 1 n d where c 1 2 nn 1 hn 1 z and min 1 n 0 n 1 z 1 c d 3 2 5 dense finite subsets in massive sets each of the results above produces in particular a finite subset z qn 1 with d z 0 indeed in each of the situations covered by theorems 3 1 3 3 and corollary 4 let us define z z as the set of the centers of all the 1 2 cubes providing a covering of z with m z 1 2 elements we have theorem 3 4 in each of the situations covered by theorems 3 1 3 3 and corollary 4 the d span of the finite set z z satisfies d z 12 nk where k is the appropriate lower bound for d z proof if certain 1 2 cubes cover z then the corresponding cubes cover z therefore m z 1 2 m z 1 2 the rest of the proof goes exactly as in the results above 3 2 6 bounding d span via minimal spanning trees theorem 3 4 provides a class of examples of finite subsets z bn 1 with positive d span roughly those are sufficiently dense finite subsets of sets of dimension n 1 or higher it is important to analyze the behavior of d span of finite and general sets z given by themselves with no relation to an underlying large set in terms of their metric structure here an appropri ate invariant may be the so called spread introduced in 36 37 a very closely related notion is the weight of minimal spanning trees see 23 and references therein the main reason for us to relate the d span with the spread and minimal spanning trees is that a lot of information is available today in this direction for some initial references see 23 and we can hope to ultimately incorporate this information in our study of polynomial and smooth interpolation problems 16 let s recall a definition of spread let gp be the set of all connected non oriented trees with p vertices we write i j g for g gp if the vertices i and j are connected by the edge in g definition 3 3 let x be a metric space 0 for each x 1 xp x and g gp let g x 1 xp i j g d xi xj where d is a distance in x define x 1 xp as infg gp g x 1 xp the tree g on which the infinum is achieved is called the minimal spanning tree now let a x we define the spread of a v a by v a sup p x 1 xp a x 1 xp for x 1 xp x x 1 xp is called a weight of the minimal span ning tree g on x 1 xp notice that the 1 minimal tree is also minimal for any see 23 under a different name spread for subsets of a real line has been studied in 4 a notion of weight has appeared earlier in geometric combinatorics and in fractal geometry compare 23 24 19 and references therein how ever we are not aware of any appearance of the general notion of spread in metric spaces as defined above let us also notice that as a function of the spread v a is a kind of a zeta function for a 0 1 3 6 10 15 1 2 n n 1 the spread v a is exactly the riemann function while for a 0 1 n with 0 0 1 1 n n i 1 1 i n 1 we have v a so it may be a good idea to substitute into v a complex values of see 24 for a detailed treatment of fractal geometry from this point of view we shall not touch here general properties of spread as well as its relations to the geometry of critical values of smooth functions instead we give a lower bound for the d span in terms of spread let us first provide an immediate generalization to higher dimensions of proposition 3 2 above we have to consider here the l distance instead of the usual euclidean distance in rn proposition 3 6 let d and a finite subset z qn 1 be given and let 0 be the minimal distance between the points of z assume that z p md 0 then the d span d z satisfies the inequality d z n 0 p md 0 0 17 for any z finite or infinite we can apply proposition 3 6 to finite subsets of z let us introduce some convenient notations see 37 definition 3 4 let x be a metric space for x 1 xp x let x 1 xp min i 6 j d xi xj for a x define a p for any natural p 2 by a p sup x 1 xp a x 1 xp proposition 3 6 implies corollary 5 let d and a finite subset z qn 1 be given if for a certain p we have md z p p then d z nz p p md z p 0 let us remind that md n 1 j 0 cj n d 1 j c n d 1 n 1 for 1 hence we have a weaker but simpler version of corollary 5 corollary 6 let d and a finite subset z qn 1 be given if for a certain p we have c n d z p 1 n p then d z nz p p c n d z p 1 n 0 3 3 now we can give a criterion of positivity of d z in terms of the spread of z theorem 3 5 let d and a subset z qn 1 be given if for a certain with n 1 n we have v z c d n 1 n 1 where x p 1 1 px then d z 0 proof assume that d z 0 then by corollary 5 we have for each p 2 3 that c n d z p 1 n p hence z p c n d p 1 n 1 and for each we have p 2 z p c n d n 1 p 1 1 p n 1 c n d n 1 n 1 3 4 now the following result relates z p and v z proposition 3 7 for any 0 sup p 2 p 1 z p v z j 2 z j 18 the proof of proposition 3 7 is given in 36 see also 37 combining this result with 3 4 we complete the proof of theorem 3 5 in analogy with the hausdorf and entropy dimensions let us define the v dimension as follows dimv a inf v a it turns out that always dimv a dime a see 36 37 23 now theorem 3 5 provides another proof of proposition 3 5 above indeed if dime z s n 1 we fix some such that n 1 s dimv z by definition of dimv z we have v z while n 1 is finite since n 1 theorem 3 5 implies now that d z 0 there are limit cases where spread is more sensitive to certain subtle geometric properties of z than the covering number see 36 37 23 and references therein it is also related with some important notions in potential theory like transfinite diameter we plan to present some results in this direction separately references 1 s bernstein sur une formule d interpolation comptes rendus as
