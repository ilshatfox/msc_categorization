can be approximated by g valued continuous functions in the norm l g i w where i is a compact interval g is a real and sep arable hilbert space and w is certain g valued weakly measurable weight thus

of functions which can be approximated by polynomials in the norm l i if we identify as usual functions which are equal almost everywhere weierstrass proved this theorem in 1885 also in that time he proved the density of trigonometric polynomials in the class of 2 periodic continuous real valued functions these results were in a sense a counterbalance to weierstrass famous example of 1861 on the existence of a continuous nowhere differentiable function see 1 two subject of interest for weierstrass were complex function theory and the possibility of representing functions by power series the result obtained in his paper in 1885 should be viewed from that perspective moreover the title of the paper emphasizes such viewpoint his pa per was titled on the possibility of giving an analytic representation to an arbitrary function of real variable see 16 weierstrass percep tion on analytic functions was functions that could be represented by power series this paper of weierstrass was reprinted in weierstrass research partially supported by did usb under grant di cb 015 04 1 http arxiv org abs math 0611034 v 3 2 yamilet quintana mathematische werke collected works with some notable additions for example a short introduction this reprint appeared in 1903 and contains the following statement the main result of this paper restrict to the one variable case can be summarized as follows let f c r then there exists a sequence f 1 f 2 of entire func tions for which f x i 1 fi x for each x r in addition the convergence of above sum is uniform on every finite interval let us observe that there is not mention of fact that the fi may be assumed to be polynomial we state weierstrass approximation theorem not as given in his paper but as it is currently stated and understood theorem 1 1 k weierstrass given f a b r continuous and an arbitrary 0 there exists an algebraic polynomial p such that 1 1 f x p x x a b two papers of runge published about the same time also provided a proof of this result but unfortunately the theorem was not titled weierstrass runge theorem the impact of weierstrass approxima tion theorem on the mathematical world was immediate there were later proofs of famous mathematicians such as picard 1891 volterra 1897 lebesgue 1898 mittag leffler 1900 landau 1908 de la vallee poussin 1912 the proofs more commonly taken at level of undergraduate courses in mathematics are those of feje r 1900 and bernstein 1912 see for example 2 6 16 22 or 20 there have been many improvements generalizations and ramifica tions of weierstrass approximation theorem for instance if f is a v valued function with v a real or complex finite dimensional linear space and if f is a function of several real variables each one of these cases have an easy formulation of results while the case in which f is a function of several complex variables requires a more profound study with skillful adaptations of both hypothesis and conclusion a detailed presentation of such results may be found in 30 3 7 12 and 13 also we must recall the bernstein s problem on approxi mation by polynomials on the whole real line see 16 17 and 18 and the approximation problem for unbounded functions in i see for example 11 on hilbert extensions of weierstrass theorem with weights 3 in recent years it has arisen a new focus on the generalizations of weierstrass approximation theorem which uses the weighted approx imation more precisely if i is a compact interval the approximation problem is studied with the norm l i w defined by 1 2 f l i w ess supx i f x w x where w is a weight i e a non negative measurable function and the convention 0 0 is used observe that 1 2 is not the usual definition of the l norm in the context of measure theory although it is the correct definition when we work with weights see e g 4 and 8 considering weighted norms has been proved to be interesting mainly because of two reasons first they allow to wider the set of approx imable functions since the functions in l i w can have singulari ties where the weight tends to zero and second it is possible to find functions which approximate a given function f whose qualitative be havior is similar to qualitative behavior of f at those points where the weight tends to infinity the reader may find in 24 26 27 and 28 recent and detailed studies about such subject another special kind of approximation problems arises when we con sider simultaneous approximation which includes derivatives of cer tain functions this is the case of versions of weierstrass theorem in weighted sobolev spaces with respect to recent developments about this subject we refer to 26 and 27 in the first paper under enough general conditions concerning the vector weights the so called type 1 defined in a compact interval i the authors characterize to the closure in the weighted sobolev space w k i w of the spaces of polyno mials k differentiable functions and infinite differentiable functions respectively in the second paper the reader may find shaper results for the case k 1 in this paper we obtain a new result on weierstrass approxima tion theorem with weights when considering approximation in hilbert spaces we consider a real and separable hilbert space g a compact interval i r the space of all the g valued essentially bounded func tions l g i a weakly measurable function w i g the space of all g valued continuous functions c i g the space of all the g valued functions l g i w which are bounded with respect to the norm de fined by 1 3 f l g i w ess supt i fw t g the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we provide some notation necessary preliminaries and auxiliary results which will be 4 yamilet quintana often used throughout the text we shall use standard notation or it will be properly introduced whenever needed in section 3 we present the main result about approximation in l g i w 2 preliminaries in what follows i stands for any compact interval in r by l 2 r we denote the real linear space of all sequences xn n z with n 0 xn 2 and g g stands for a real and separable hilbert space with as sociated norm denoted by g it is well known that every real and separable hilbert space g is isomorphic either to rn for some n n or to l 2 r in each case g has structure of commutative banach algebra with the coordinatewise operations in the first case we have commutative banach algebra with identity and the second case this is commutative banach algebra without identity the reader is referred to 9 14 or 33 for more details about these statements however in many applications this isomorphism is not interesting for instance we may be dealing with hilbert spaces of say analytic or differentiable functions and in this interplay between the hilbert space structure and the properties of individual functions the second can be fruitful despite cases as the previous to know such isomorphism is valuable because it allows to determine as far as the properties of hilbert spaces can be useful for us and furthermore we can just think in l 2 r or rn when we want 2 1 on weighted spaces a detailed discussion about properties of weighted spaces may be found in 6 10 15 19 or 23 we recall here some important tools and definitions which will be used through out this paper definition 2 1 a scalar weight w is a measurable function w r 0 if w is only defined in a r we set w 0 in r a definition 2 2 given a measurable set a r and a scalar weight w we define the space l a w as the space of equivalence classes of measurable functions f a r with respect to the norm f l a w ess supx a f x w x this space inherits some properties from the classical lebesgue space l a and it allows us to study new functions which could not be in the classical l a see for example 6 29 another properties of l a w have a strong relation with the nature of the weight w in fact if a i and w has multiplicative inverse i e there exists a on hilbert extensions of weierstrass theorem with weights 5 weight w 1 i r such that w t w 1 t 1 t i then it is easy to see that l i w and l i are isomorphic since the map w l i w l i given by w f fw is a linear and bijective isometry and therefore w is also homeomorphism or equivalently for all y l i w we have w y w y where we take each closure with respect to the norms l i w and l i respectively also for all a l i 1 w a 1 w a and 1 w w 1 then using weierstrass theorem we have 1 w p 1 w p f l i w fw c i 2 4 unfortunately the last equality in 2 4 does not allow to obtain information on local behavior of the functions f l i w which can be approximated furthermore if f l i w then in general fw is not continuous function since its continuity also depends of the singularities of weight w see 6 16 17 28 24 27 the next definition presents the classification of the singularities of a scalar weight w done in 27 to show the results about density of continuous functions in the space l supp w w definition 2 3 given a scalar weight w we say that a supp w is a singularity of w or singular for w if ess lim infx supp w x aw x 0 we say that a singularity a of w is of type 1 if ess limx aw x 0 we say that a singularity a of w is of type 2 if 0 ess lim supx aw x we say that a singularity a of w is of type 3 if ess lim supx aw x we denote by s and si i 1 2 3 respectively the set of singulari ties of w and the set of singularities of w of type i we say that a s i respectively a s i if a verifies the property in the definition of si when we take the limit as x a respectively x a we define s s 1 s 2 s 3 and s s 1 s 2 s 3 definition 2 4 given a scalar weight w we define the right regular and left regular points of w respectively as r a supp w ess lim infx supp w x a w x 0 r a supp w ess lim infx supp w x a w x 0 the following result was proved in 27 and it states a characteriza tion for the functions in l supp w w which can be approximated by continuous functions in norm l supp w w for every w 6 yamilet quintana theorem 2 1 portilla et al 27 theorem 1 2 let w be any scalar weight and h 0 f l supp w w f is continuous to the right at every point of r f is continuous to the left at every point of r for each a s ess limx a f x f a w x 0 for each a s ess limx a f x f a w x 0 then a the closure of c r l w in l w is h 0 b if w l loc r then the closure of c r l w in l w is also h 0 c if supp w is compact and w l r then the closure of the space of polynomials is h 0 as well theorem 2 1 is going to be an important tool which is going to allow us to obtain the key for the first result about hilbert extensions of weierstrass theorem with weights in the present paper 2 2 g valued functions definition 2 5 let g be a real and separable hilbert space and we consider any sequence xn g we say that the support of xn is the set of n for which xn 6 0 we denote to support of xn by supp xn definition 2 6 let g be a real and separable hilbert space a weight w on g is a weakly measurable function w i g let g be a real and separable hilbert space a g valued polynomial on i is a function i g such that t n n nt n where n n n g has finite support let p g be the space of all g valued polynomials on i it is well known that p g is a subalgebra of the space c i g of all continuous g valued functions on i for 1 p lp g i denotes the set of all weakly measurable functions f i g such that i f t p g dt if 1 p or ess supt i f t g if p on hilbert extensions of weierstrass theorem with weights 7 then l 2 g i is a hilbert space with respect to the inner product f g l 2 g i i f t g t g dt p g is also dense in lp g i for 1 p more details about these spaces may be found in 31 definition 2 7 let g be a real and separable hilbert space a weight w on g is a weakly measurable function w i g definition 2 8 let w be a weight on g we define the space l g i w as the space of equivalence classes of all the g valued weakly measurable functions f i g with respect to the norm f l g i w ess supt i fw t g where fw i g is defined as follows if dimg we have the functions f and w can be expressed by f f 1 fn 0 and w w 1 wn 0 respectively where fj wj i r for j 1 n 0 with n 0 dimg then fw t f 1 t w 1 t fn 0 t wn 0 t for t i if dim g let j j z be a complete orthonormal system then for t i the functions f and w can be expressed as f t j 0 f t j g j and w t j 0 w t j g j respectively so we can define fw t j 0 f t j g w t j g j for t i on this way we can study our approximation problem using the properties of commutative banach algebra of l 2 r the next proposition shows a result about algebraic properties and density of p g in c i g the analogous result when g is a complex separable hilbert space appears in 31 proposition 2 1 i p g is a subalgebra of the space of all g valued continuous functions on i ii the closure of p g in l g i is c i g proof i it is straight forward ii it is enough to prove that c i g p g since p g c i g c i g case 1 dim g 8 yamilet quintana let us assume that dimg n 0 given an orthonormal basis 1 n 0 of g 0 and f c i g c i rn 0 then f f 1 fn 0 with fj c i j 1 n 0 the weierstrass theorem guarantees that there exists pk p such that fj pj l i n 0 j 1 n 0 if we consider the polynomial p p g such that p p 1 pn 0 then we have that f p l g i ess supt i f p t g ess supt i n 0 j 1 f t p t j g 2 1 2 ess supt i f 1 p 1 t fn 0 pn 0 t rn 0 case 2 g is infinite dimensional let f c i g and j j z a complete orthonormal system then for each t i f t j 0 f t j g j consequently given 0 there exists m 0 z such that f t n j 0 f t j j g whenever n m 0 now let us consider the functions fj i r given by fj t f t j g we have that f fj with j z fj t 2 for each t i and fj c i so weierstrass approximation theorem guarantees that there exists a sequence pj j z p such that fj pj l i j 1 j z we define the g polynomials p j p g by p j t pj t j for each j z then for n m 0 we have on hilbert extensions of weierstrass theorem with weights 9 f t n j 0 p j t g f t n j 0 fj t j g n j 0 fj t j n j 0 p j t g j 0 fj t pj t 2 1 2 j 0 j 1 2 1 2 1 j 0 1 j 1 2 1 2 from these inequalities we can deduce that for n large enough there exists qn t n j 0 p j t such that f qn l g i c this completes the proof 3 the main results in this section we only deal with weights w such that supp w i 3 1 approximation in l g i w definition 3 1 let g be a real and separable hilbert space and let w be a weight on g we say that w is admissible if one of the following conditions is satisfied i if dimg then each one of the components wj 1 j dimg is a scalar weight ii if dimg j j z is a complete orthonormal system and w t j 0 w t j g j then each one of the functions w t j g is a weight function let us observe that if dim g and w is admissible then it induces a family of weighted l 2 r spaces l 2 t r w t i given by l 2 t r w xj j z j 0 w t j g xj 2 and for each t i the function wj t w t j g also induces a linear isometry twj l 2 t r wj l 2 r given by twj xj j z wj t xj j z w t j g xj j z for a brief study on weighted l 2 r spaces the reader is referred to 9 in order to characterize the g valued functions which can be 10 yamilet quintana approximated in l g i w by functions in c i g l g i w our ar gument requires an admissible weight w it is clear that in the one dimensional case an admissible weight is an arbitrary scalar weight on i and therefore the theorem 2 1 in 27 holds in this case theorem 3 1 let g be a real and separable hilbert space and let w be an admissible weight on g let us define h f l g i w f f 1 fn 0 and fj hj 1 j n 0 with n 0 dimg or f fj and fj hj j z if dim g where hj fj l i wj fj is continuous to the right at every point of r fj is continuous to the left at every point of r for each a s ess limx a fj x fj a wj x 0 for each a s ess limx a fj x fj a wj x 0 then the closure of c i g l g i w in l g i w is h furthermore if w l g i then the closure of the space of g valued polynomials is h as well proof let us assume that dimg n 0 if f c i g l g i w l g i w then f f 1 fn 0 with fj i r 1 j n 0 given 0 there exists g c i g l g i w such that f g l g i w let us consider g 1 gn 0 such that gj c i l i wj and g g 1 gn 0 then fj t gj t wj t ess sups i n 0 j 1 fj s gj s wj s 2 1

for 1 j n 0 and the part a of theorem 2 1 gives thath contains c i g l g i w l g i w in order to see that h is contained in c i g l g i w l g i w let us fix f h and 0 and let us consider each one of its component functions fj hj j 1 n 0 by the part a of theorem 2 1 there exists gj c i l i wj j 1 n 0 such that fj gj l i wj n 0 on hilbert extensions of weierstrass theorem with weights 11 we define the function g c i g such that g g 1 gn 0 then f g l g i w ess supt i f p w t g ess supt i n 0 j 1 fj t gj t wj t 2 1 2 if w l g i the closure of the g valued polynomials is h as well as a consequence of proposition 2 1 in a similar way if dimg j j z is a complete orthonormal system and f c i g l g i w l g i w then f t j 0 f t j j given 0 there exists g c i g l g i w such that f g l g i w let us
