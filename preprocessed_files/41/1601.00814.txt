integrable with jacobi weights on 1 1 and prove hardy littlewood type inequalities for fractional integrals as applications we obtain the sharp lp lq ulyanov type inequalities for the ditzian totik moduli of smoothness and the k functionals of fractional order 1 introduction the following lp lq inequalities of ulyanov type between moduli of smoothness of functions on t play an important role in

lp t is given by r f p sup h 6 rhf x lp t 1 6 p 6 where rhf x r 1 h hf x and hf x f x h f x recently 20 23 the sharp version of 1 1 was proved in the case 1 p q r f t q 6 c t 0 u r f u p q 1 du u 1 q 1 2 where r f u p is the moduli of smoothness of the fractional order r 0 moreover it turned out that 1 2 also holds if p q 1 see 21 in this case 1 and one can work with the classical not necessary fractional moduli of smoothness on the other hand 1 2 is not true 21 for 1 p q or 1 p q in the present paper we consider a nonperiodic case namely lp spaces with jacobi weights on an interval and obtain inequalities similar to 1 2 for the fractional k functionals and ditzian totik moduli of smoothness we start with notation key words and phrases jacobi weights landau type inequalities hardy

the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we obtain the key result to get sharp ulyanov inequalities the weighted inequalities of hardy littlewood and landau type for functions

for the ditzian totik moduli of smoothness are obtained namely we study a relationship between these moduli and the corresponding k functionals and prove sharp ulyanov inequalities for the ditzian totik moduli in the case of 1 6 p 6 q 6 theorem 5 2 inequalities for fractional integrals with jacobi weights 2 1 landau type inequalities we will need the following hardy type inequality see e g 5 and 19 theorem 6 2 example 6 8 we set 1 q 0 for q theorem a let 1 6 p 6 q 6 p q 6 a 1 q x 0 then the inequality f x xa lq 0 x 6 c p q a x f x xa h lp 0 x holds for any locally absolutely continuous function f on 0 x with the property f x 0 if and only if h 6 1 1 p 1 q let us mention that the quantity c p q a x is nondecreasing with respect to x the following landau type inequality can be found in e g 6 ch 2 th 5 6 p 38 theorem b for 1 6 p 6 2 there is a constant c such that for all r 0 and any function f with f 1 absolutely continuous on 1 2 1 2 and f lp 1 2 1 2 we have f r lp 1 2 1 2 6 c f lp 1 2 1 2 f lp 1 2 1 2 as a corollary of theorem a and theorem b we get 4 polina glazyrina and sergey tikhonov lemma 1 suppose that 1 6 p 6 q 6 p q 6 a b 1 q c d 1 p r is a nonnegative integer k is a

the analogous statement also holds with respect to the parameter b proof of lemma 1 it is enough to verify inequality 2 1 for k 1 the proof in the general case is by induction on k note that f r is continuous on 1 2 1 2 by our assumption we take x 1 2 1 2 such that f r x min f r x x 1 2 1 2 let g x f r x f r x then f r w a b q 6 gw a b q f r x w a b q 6 gw a b lq 1 x gw a b lq x 1 f r x w a b lq

f r 1 l 1 1 2 1 2 6 2 c d a h b h c fw c d lp 1 1 f r 1 w a h b h lp 1 1 where c depends only on r 1 thus 2 1 follows let us now show 2 2 since for any 0 6 1 6 2 the estimate w a h 2 b h x 6 2 2 1 w a

collorary 17 11 which is written in our notation as follows theorem c if 1 p 6 q 1 a b c d 1 s 1 p 1 q a q c p 2 1 2 1 p 1 q b q d p 2 1 2 1 p 1 q the quantities a c 1 p and b d 1 p are not positive

1 t f q a b 6 c f p c d 6 polina glazyrina and sergey tikhonov where c is independent of and f moreover there is a function tf in l a b q such that t f converges to tf in l a b q as 1 if it is also assumed that a 1 1 q and b 1 1 q then t f k 0 0 6 k 6 h 1 k hf k h max 0 h 6 k the next hardy littlewood inequality is a simple corollary of theorem c corollary 1 let 1 p q 1 2 a b 1 1 a 1 1 p b 1 1 p and 1 p 1 q let also f l a b p then there exists c independent of f such that i f q a b 6 c f p a b 2 4 in the special case a b the hardy littlewood inequality 2 4 was studied by askey and wainger 2 sec j see also 1 and later by bavinck and trebels 3 theorem 5 4 4 theorems 1 and 1 theorem d 2 4 let 1 p q a b 1 a b 1 and 2 a 2 1 p 1 q if f l a b p then i a b f l a b q and i a b f q a b 6 c p q a b f p a b for 6 a b we have the following result theorem 2 let 1 p q a b 1 a 1 2 1 p 6 2 a b 6 q 2 5 the quantities a a 1 p and b b 1 p be not positive integers and either a or a and q 2 or a and p 2 let 2 a 2 1 p 1 q 2 6 f l a b p l 1 and f k 0 0 6 k 6 max 0 a max 0 b 1 2 7 then there exists c independent of f such that i f q a b 6 c f p a b 2 8 proof it is sufficient to prove this theorem for polynomials indeed suppose that 2 8 holds for polynomials consider a sequence of polynomials qm convergent to f in l a b p and l 1 then i qm is a cauchy sequence in l a b q and it converges to some function g in l a b q without loss of generality we can assume that i qm converges to g a e on 1 1 since the operator i is continuous in l 1 the sequence i qm converges jacobi weights fractional integration and sharp ulyanov inequalities 7 to i f in l 1 there is a subsequence i qmj convergent to i f a e on 1 1 therefore g i f let f be a polynomial i e f k 0 ck k where ck f k and ck 0 for k deg f case 1 consider a q 2 more precisely under assumption of the theorem the following relations are possible a and q 2 or a and q 2 now we define 1 and p 1 if a then we set 1 q 2 a q 2 1 p 1 a p 1 2 1 2 1 p 1 p 1 in this case we have 2 1 1 p 1 2 a 1 p 2 a q 2 and 2 1 2 1 p 1 1 q 1 p 1 p 1 2 a 2 1 p 1 q 2 9 notice that condition a implies that 1 max a 0 and p p 1 q if a then we set 1 p 1 p we divide the rest of the proof in case 1 into three steps step 1 1 we apply theorem c with q p p 1 p 1 1 c d a b h 0 s 1 1 p 1 p 1 and k 1 1 k 1 then we have a 1 b p 1 b p 1 2 1 2 1 p 1 p 1 1 p 1 2 a b p 2 p 2 10 a a 1 p b b 1 p therefore under condition 2 7 for any 0 1 we obtain the inequality c 0 k 1 k 1 1 k 1 ck 1 1 k p 1 1 b 6 c f p a b 2 11 where c is independent of f and since f is a polynomial the sum is finite and we can rewrite 2 11 as c 0 k 1 1 1 k 1 ck 1 1 k p 1 1 b 6 c f p a b relations 2 5 and 2 10 show that 1 b and hence c 0 k 1 1 1 k 1 ck 1 1 k p 1 1 1 6 c f p a b 2 12 8 polina glazyrina and sergey tikhonov step 1 2 in view of 2 6 and 2 9 we have 1 2 1 2 1 p 1 1 q we can apply theorem d for the pair of spaces l 1 1 q and l 1 1 p 1 to get c 0 k 1 1 1 k ck 1 1 k q 1 1 6 c c 0 k 1 1 1 k 1 ck 1 1 k p 1 1 1 2 13 step 1 3 we use theorem c once again with q p q q 1 1 c d 1 1 and k k 1 1 k then s 0 a a b q 1 q 1 2 b q q 2 a b 2 q 2 14 and a b 1 1 q 1 1 1 q 1 1 q 6 1 2 1 q

12 2 13 and 2 15 we obtain inequality 2 8 case 2 consider 6 a p 6 2 more precisely under assumption of the theorem the following relations are possible a and p 2 or a and p 6 2 now we define 1 and q 1 if a then we set 1 2 a p 2 p a q 1 q 1 1 2 1 2 1 q 1 1 q in this case we have 2 1 1 q 1 2 a 1 q 2 a 2 p and 2 1 2 1 p 1 q 1 1 q 1 1 q 2 a 2 1 p 1 q 2 16 notice that condition a implies that 1 max a 0 and p q 1 q if a then we set 1 q 1 q we can argue similarly to the proof in case 1 dividing the rest of the proof into three steps jacobi weights fractional integration and sharp ulyanov inequalities 9 step 2 1 we are going to use theorem c with q p p p 1 1 c d a b h 0 s 0 and k 1 then a 1 b p b p 1 2 1 p 2 a b p 2 p 2 17 a a 1 p b b 1 p therefore under condition 2 7 for any 0 1 we obtain the inequality c 0 k 1 kck 1 1 k p 1 b 6 c f p a b 2 18 where c does not depend on f and since f is a polynomial the sum is finite taking into account 2 5 and 2 17 we conclude that 1 b and hence and we can rewrite 2 18 as c 0 k 1 ck 1 1 k p 1 1 6 c f p a b 2 19 step 2 2 set 1 1 q 1 1 q in view of 2 6 and 2 16 we have 1 2 1 1 1 p 1 q 1 we can apply theorem d for the pair of spaces l 1 1 q 1 and l 1 1 p to get c 0 k 1 1 1 k 1 ck 1 1 k q 1 1 1 6 c c 0 k 1 ck 1 1 k p 1 1 2 20 step 2 3 we use theorem c once again with q p q q 1 1 1 c d 1 1 and k k 1 1 1 k k 1 hence s 1 1 q 1 1 q a a b q 1 q 1 1 2 1 2

that b 6 b and hence c 0 k 1 k ck k q a b 6 2 b b c 0 k 1 k ck k q a b 2 22 finally combining 2 19 2 20 and 2 22 we obtain inequality 2 8 10 polina glazyrina and sergey tikhonov 3 ulyanov type

version of the nikolskii stechkin type inequality was proved in 14 theorem 7 3 1 this argument can be used to show the weighted version the relation between k functionals 4 1 and 3 3 in the case when r is positive integer follows from corollary 2 below note that the case a b is due to dai and ditzian 8 theorem 7 1 and is based on the muckenhoupt transplantation theorem we follow the idea of their proof and first obtain the following result theorem 4 let 1 p r be a positive integer and a b 1 be such that 3 1 holds then there exists a constant c such that for any q we have rq r p a b 6 c d r q p
