different thermo elastic properties of glass fibers and polymer matrices can generate residual thermal stresses in injection molded fiber reinforced plastic frp objects during cooling from mold to room temperature these stresses can be relaxed by large deformations resulting from an instability of the unwarped configuration i e buckling this article investigates the ther mal buckling of thin frp disks via an analytical formulation based on the fo ppl von ka rma n theory expanding on our previous work cylindrical or thotropy with material parameters varying over the disk thickness is assumed in order to account for thickness dependency of the glass fiber orientation distribution a disk parameter generalizing the thermal anisotropy ratio for homogeneous orthotropic disks is introduced and its relation with the occur rence and periodicity of buckling is discussed this is done for a skin core skin model for which the core to total thickness ratio is defined for fiber orientation distributions typical of injection molded disks it is found that there exists a value of the thickness ratio for which no buckling occurs it is also demonstrated that the periodicity of

fiber reinforced plastics frps are a class of materials consisting of a thermoplastic matrix reinforced by short glass fibers they are often pro cessed by injecting the molten polymer and the glass fibers into a mold injection molding the specific process parameters determine the orien tation of the fibers in the final product which in turn translates to its thermo elastic properties see for example tseng and osswald 1994 as the injection molded part cools down it tends to shrink while building up stresses adhikari et al 2016 the problem of plates with residual thermal stresses has been widely investigated see hetnarski 2014 for a comprehen sive review residual stresses can be relaxed by sudden large deformation a phenomenon referred to as buckling in general it is possible to identify a parameter describing the magnitude of the internal stresses buckling occurs corresponding author email address j j m slot tue nl j j m slot 2 when this parameter exceeds a certain critical value the buckling threshold in a previous work gualdi et al 2021 we studied the thermal buckling of thin plates with uniform fiber orientation distribution through the wall thickness a framework for the buckling analysis based on the von ka rma n theory with constitutive linearity in the thermo elastic material behavior hooke duhamel model was formulated the framework was specified for the particular case of a free disk with cylindrical orthotropy and uniform thermo elastic properties through its thickness a general technique to de termine post buckling deflections based on a perturbation approach and the fourier galerkin method was proposed it was found that the periodicity of the first buckling mode for orthotropic disks is fully determined by the anisotropy ratio of the elastic moduli or equivalently by the ratio of the coefficients of thermal expansion in agreement with experimental evidence available in the literature kikuchi and koyama 1994 1996 a b by aver aging the thermo elastic properties of the material over the disk thickness the model can be applied to systems where the fiber orientation distribution is a function of the vertical coordinate however a more general formulation accounting for thickness dependent properties is required to properly inves tigate their effects on the buckling behavior the orientation of the glass fibers in injection molded products with thin walls has been extensively investigated regardless of the mold geometry the fibers tend to align in the flow direction or perpendicular to it trans verse direction during the injection process depending on their distance from the mold walls for flat parts the orientation can be investigated by taking cross sections perpendicular to their mid planes it is reported in the lit 3 erature that the fibers are generally parallel to the walls with predominant alignment along the transverse direction close to the center and along the flow direction close to the surface this is shown for reference geometries in oumer and mamat 2012 rectangular cavity lionetto et al 2021 ten sile bar hamanaka et al 2017 rectangular plate and kikuchi and koyama 1996 a disk and for a complex geometry in baranowski et al 2019 bear ing part for automotive applications variations in the predominant orien tation are often observed close to the lateral edges of the mold this effect is highlighted for fiber reinforced pa 66 disks in kikuchi and koyama 1996 a where it is shown to become stronger for thicker disks and remain secondary for thinner geometries in this work we will assume that the in plane varia tions in the fiber orientation distribution can be neglected i e we will con sider geometries with a large lateral dimension over thickness ratio when this assumption is satisfied the fiber orientation distribution results in a 2 d orthotropic material model with parameters varying through the thickness vertical direction z the material properties in the in plane directions of or thotropy at a given z are chosen such that the macroscopic material behavior resulting from the complex in plane distribution is reproduced an equiva lent description is that of a continuous sequence of infinitely thin orthotropic layers z constant in the following we will refer to this representation as orthotropic stack or stack model in contrast to orthotropic single layer or single layer model when the material parameters are constant through the thickness the latter yields the formulation of our previous work as re called in the paragraph above even though the material properties in the stack model are allowed to vary arbitrarily though the thickness they are 4 usually approximated with piecewise constant functions the skin core skin three layer model is one of the most used representations more accurate de scriptions can generally be obtained by adding a shell layer between the core and the skin resulting in the five layer skin shell core shell skin model tech niques to translate continuous fiber orientation distributions to such mod els can be found for example in lionetto et al 2021 and hamanaka et al 2017 these stack models have been introduced here as approximations of injection molded geometries but they can be also used to describe exactly composite plates made of orthotropic layers in fact the general formulation provided in our previous work can be applied to such problems too the buckling behavior of products with material properties varying through their thickness has been widely studied for composite materials often it is investigated how the buckling parameter depends on the layer proper ties in order to limit the amount of warpage by specific design of the stack build up it is generally found via analytical considerations based on lin ear elasticity that the ratios between the thicknesses of the various layers are crucial in the determination of the onset of buckling this is shown for example in lopatin and morozov 2008 where a symmetrical sandwich panel with orthotropic core subjected to in plane compression is considered when the stack is made of orthotropic layers also the ratio between the elastic moduli in the directions of orthotropy becomes a relevant param eter such result can be found again in lopatin and morozov 2008 but also in wankhade and niyogi 2020 where the buckling of composite plates with orthotropic laminae is addressed via numerical methods while layer thickness and level of orthotropy can be easily tuned in laminated compos 5 ites in injection molded products they are the result of the flow path and process conditions and thus harder to control nevertheless they are ex pected to play analogous roles in determining the buckling characteristics of the product the relation between layer thickness level of orthotropy and observed warpage upon cooling is discussed for injection molded disks in kikuchi and koyama 1996 b based on experiments and numerical sim ulations the authors correlate the critical buckling temperature to r the ratio between the coefficients of thermal expansion in the radial and tangen tial directions averaged over the disk thickness this parameter is in fact a combination of the layer thickness ratios and levels of anisotropy and the two contributions cannot be analyzed separately with the proposed approach a modified linear correlation between r and the normalized buckling tem perature is also proposed the present work investigates the relation between thickness dependent fiber orientation distributions and buckling behavior in thin injection molded disks via equivalent stack models the effects of layer thickness and orthotropy level are investigated independently and summarized by a disk parameter which is a generalized thermal anisotropy ratio and plays an analogous role to that of r in kikuchi and koyama 1996 b the formulation and solution technique presented in our previous work gualdi et al 2021 is used when comparing the results to those of the single layer formulation an improvement in the accuracy of the predictions is observed when using a skin core skin formulation analytical considerations are used to improve the modified linear correlation between averaged thermal anisotropy and buck ling temperature proposed in kikuchi and koyama 1996 b the range of 6 validity of the new expression is extended and the fit with the available nu merical results is improved the paper is organized as follows the fo ppl von ka rma n equations for a stack of orthotropic circular layers are derived in section 2 the solution technique is also recalled in the same section in section 3 the role of the generalized thermal anisotropy ratio is discussed for a skin core skin ge ometry results are compared to those of the single layer model from our previous work finally the correlation between normalized buckling tem perature and thermal anisotropy ratio is studied and an improved fitting function is proposed 2 the fo ppl von ka rma n equations for continuous orthotropic disks let us consider a thin disk of thickness h and radius r let the center of the coordinate system coincide with the center of the midplane of the disk the radial tangential and normal or vertical directions are indicated with r and z respectively we assume that the material behavior is described by the hooke duhamel law linear thermo elasticity and that the thermo elastic properties are symmetric with respect to the midplane of the plate thermal stresses are taken proportional to z z the sym metric temperature difference due to cooling down of the disk during which the temperature decreases from its higher initial value ti of the hot mold to its final lower value tf the colder room temperature since large deflections w can occur during cooling the mechanics of deformation is best described by the fo ppl von ka rma n theory a general coordinate free formulation 7 of the fo ppl von ka rma n equations for thin anisotropic and inhomogeneous plates was derived in gualdi et al 2021 a solution technique based on per turbation schemes and galerkin fourier approximations was also presented the equations were then specified for the particular case of a cylindrically or thotropic disk with constant thermo elastic properties through the thickness here we want to describe disks with thickness dependent fiber orientation distributions we will still assume that each cross section z constant is cylindrically orthotropic but we will allow the material properties to be functions of z under these assumptions the fo ppl von ka rma n equations take the same structure as the particular homogeneous case in gualdi et al 2021 21 w w 22 1 2 w w 1 the expressions of the differential operators 21 2 2 and are given in appendix a and differ from the ones in gualdi et al 2021 only in the material dependent coefficients the same holds for the four boundary con ditions of vanishing normal and shear resultants bending moment and gen eralized shear force their explicit expressions are given in appendix a the unknown deflection w and airy stress function both functions of r r and are dimensionless they can be obtained from their dimensional forms wdim and dim via the following relations w eh d wdim h d dim 2 where e 1 h h 2 h 2 e z dz d h 2 h 2 e z z 2 1 z 2 dz 3 8 the previous relations and the differential operators in 1 involve geometri cal averages and ratios of the thermo elastic properties in the two directions of orthotropy their definitions are analogous to those in gualdi et al 2021 and are here just recalled e z er z e z z r z r z k z kr z k z 4 z e z er z r z r z z kr z k z 5 for each value of z 1 represents isotropic behavior 1 corre sponds to a predominant radial fiber orientation and 1 to a tangential one as the present model is formulated in terms of the composite thermo elastic properties it can also be applied when anisotropic properties are the result of the presence of different reinforcements e g platelets and or pro cessing conditions e g flow orientation since the structure of the system and its boundary conditions are the same as for the more specific case described in gualdi et al 2021 the same so lution technique discussed there can be here applied directly therefore w and are sought for by expanding them in powers of the small parameter as follows w w 0 w 1 2 w 2 6 0 1 2 2 7 where the parameter is defined as c c c c 8 9 here c is the minimum temperature difference required for buckling still unknown and is the average of z over the thickness the dimensionless buckling parameter and its critical value c are defined by a more general version of equation 40 from gualdi et al 2021 h 3 d r h 2 k 2 0 a 0 b 0 k 1 0 b 0 c 0 a 0 c 0 c c 9 the coefficients a 0 b 0 c 0 k 1 0 and k 2 0 are functions of the thermo elastic parameters of the material only and their expressions are given in appendix a for a temperature decrease 0 however the sign of its normalization constant depends on the considered fiber orientation distribution and thus both positive and negative values of c are of interest we also define the dimensionless parameters and as 2 c 0 a 0 2 k 1 0 b 0 c 0 k 2 0 a 0 b 0 10 as it will be demonstrated later they will determine the buckling mode and its occurrence just like and do in the uniform case after solving the system 1 order by order the approximate solution is fully determined up to the second order and reads w w 1 n cos m 11 0 2 2 n 12 the complete expressions for the solutions at each order are given in ap pendix b 3 results many commercial fem software packages allow to specify thickness dependent fiber orientation distribution tensors through a layer approach 10 the geometry is described as a stack of discrete layers each characterized by a 2 d material model in the case of thin injection molded parts a commonly used discretization is the symmetric skin core skin geometry this represen tation has proven successful to capture the mechanical behavior of parts with continuous through the thickness fiber orientation distributions while keep ing the amount of required input parameters limited in the following we will thus focus on such three layer geometry the current model however is more general and can be applied to geometries with any number of layers let h be the thickness of the core layer and h h 2 that of each skin layer h is thus the total disk thickness we define a thickness ratio as h h 0 1 13 the values of the thermo elastic properties in each layer are constant and will be denoted with the subscripts s or c when referring to the skin or core layer respectively first we will draw some general conclusions regarding the occurrence of buckling then we will compare the predictions to those of the equivalent single layer model finally the dependence of the buckling temperature on thickness and thermal anisotropy ratio will be discussed 3 1 occurrence and periodicity of buckling the occurrence of buckling is determined by the pre buckled stresses which are described by the zeroth order airy stress function 0 h 3 d r h 2 k 2 0 a 0 b 0 k 1 0 b 0 c 0 a 0 c 0 1 1 2 2 h 3 d r h 2 k 2 0 1 b 0 a 0 1 2 1 2 1 1 2 2 14 11 as follows from equation b 2 with according to equation 9 while the parameters and were introduced in equation 10 when the material properties are such that 0 0 the disk behaves macroscopically as if it were isotropic and no stress is built up during cooling in our previ ous work the condition for no buckling was formulated in terms of ratio of elastic moduli and ratio of the coefficients of thermal expansion for uniform orthotropic disks their values follow the same trends with respect to fiber orientation 1 for a radial alignment 1 for a tan gential alignment 1 for an isotropic distribution therefore the two parameters are interchangeable in discussing the occurrence of buckling when multiple layers are considered generalization of and general ization of become independent meaning that 1 does not imply 1 and vice versa it can be seen from equation 14 that the stress field does vanish for 1 irrespective of the value of therefore is identified here as the relevant parameter to describe the occurrence of buckling since its definition involves all the thermo elastic constants and their geometrical averages the overall isotropic behavior is thus the result of all these factors combined consequently if one were to control the degree of orientation in the layers or their thickness the macroscopic isotropic state would be reached and buckling would be avoided this is numerically shown in figure 1 where all the thermo elastic properties are kept constant values provided in table 1 and the thickness ratio is varied from 0 to 1 a predominant tangential fiber orientation is assumed in the core and a radial one in the skin layer three cases are analyzed in case i the orientation is stronger in the core and conversely stronger in the skin in case iii case ii describes a balanced 12 configuration with the same degree of orientation in all layers the buckling temperature c is plotted as a function of the value iso of the thickness ratio for which no buckling occurs isotropic thickness ratio can be identi fied as the asymptote in the buckling temperature on the second axis the corresponding value of is displayed as expected 1 when the isotropic thickness ratio is approached the equivalence of and extends to the determination of the buck ling mode too in the uniform case axisymmetric buckling coffee cup was observed for 1 whereas non axisymmetric buckling of period sad dle occurred for 1 analogous results hold for the skin core skin formulation buckling is axisymmetric for iso when 1 and non axisymmetric of period for iso when 1 these results hold irrespective of the value of the analogy between the uniform and multi layer geometries and the results discussed above are summarized in table 2 3 2 comparison with single layer model in kikuchi and koyama 1994 the type and period of buckling was linked to the anisotropy in coefficients of thermal expansion r kr k experiments were performed by injection molding disks of pa 66 with vari ous reinforcements and the macroscopic orthotropic thermo elastic properties were measured in our previous work it was demonstrated that the proposed model for uniform orthotropic disks is able to correctly capture the buckling mode and excellent quantitative agreement with the results of linear thermo elastic fem simulations was shown additional simulations were performed in kikuchi and koyama 1996 a to 13 investigate the influence of the disk thickness on the buckling temperature the fiber orientation distribution was first derived by solving the flow field in the mold and then used as input for the simulations the values of the thermal parameters averaged over the thickness of the disks were provided together with the elastic constants corresponding to the highest degree of ori entation the calculations showed that the buckling temperature increases with the disk thickness the thinnest disks 1 5 to 3 mm buckled axisymmet rically coffee cup whereas the thicker disks 4 and 5 mm did not show any warpage as their buckling threshold was higher than the applied temperature difference these results were already analyzed in our previous work with the model for uniform disks single layer formulation by using the measured thickness averaged coefficients of linear thermal expansion for the elastic moduli and poisson s ratios the values corresponding to the highest degree of orientation were used since the actual material properties vary through the thickness and show less orientation than in the ideal case of perfect align ment the buckling temperature was underestimated and the deflection was overestimated the fiber orientation distribution through the disk thickness was studied for the thinnest 1 5 mm and thickest 5 mm disks since no buckling was predicted for the thickest disk we focus on the thinnest one as explained in the next paragraphs we will translate the fiber orientation dis tribution to an orientation tensor for a three layer geometry the tensor will then be used to estimate the thickness dependent elastic parameters needed as inputs for the present model the fiber alignment is described in kikuchi and koyama 1996 a by the layer averaged orientation angle defined as the volume average per layer of 14 the fiber angle with respect to the radial direction when 0 all the fibers in the layer are radially oriented whereas when 2 they are all in the tangential direction in figure 2 is plotted against the normalized thickness z z h 2 for the 1 5 mm thick disk as 4 corresponds to an average fiber orientation of 45 approximately 15 4 of the disk shows a predominantly tangential fiber alignment and the remaining 84 6 a radial one this implies that in the corresponding skin core skin model one should use 0 154 to better describe the fiber orientation distribution in each layer additional information about the distribution of the angles around their averages should be considered however in the following we will assume that all the fibers in a layer share the same orientation angle this is done in order to maintain the focus on the validation of the proposed model as it is demonstrated in advani and tucker 1987 the symmetric orientation tensor in cylindrical coordinates for a planar uniform fiber orientation dis tribution with angle with respect to the radial direction has elements ij given by 11 cos 2 22 sin 2 12 0 15 let s and c be the averages of over the skin and core layers re spectively see figure 2 by assuming that the orientation of all fibers is given by either of the two averages the orientation tensor in each layer can be computed directly from equation 15 by taking either s or c once the orientation tensor has been estimated the thermo elastic constants can be calculated this is done numerically in digimat mf by providing the matrix and fiber thermo elastic properties the filler content and the orien tation tensor linear thermo elastic behavior is assumed mori tanaka ho 15 mogenization is used in the software to calculate the resulting composite be havior the inputs used in these calculations are summarized in table 3 and are extracted from kikuchi and koyama 1996 a and material datasheets unless otherwise specified the outcome of this procedure is shown in table 4 the estimated constants are used as inputs for the three layer model with 0 154 in agreement with previous results the model correctly predicts axisymmetric buckling the buckling threshold and magnitude of warpage at the disk edge are reported in table 5 and compared to the fem results and our previous single layer analysis despite the approximation introduced in the estimation of the thermo elastic parameters the skin core skin geometry significantly improves the quantitative agreement of the predicted buckling temperature difference with the fem results the magnitude of the deflec tion is underpredicted which is believed to be caused by the conservative calculation of the coefficients of thermal expansion for the composite a better match can be obtained by improving the calculation of the composite properties for which more information about the fiber orientation distribu tion is required 3 3 buckling temperature thickness and anisotropy the dependence of the buckling temperature difference t b on the disk thickness h c and h in our notation respectively and on the average ther mal anisotropy ratio r is discussed and quantified in kikuchi and koyama 1996 b by means of fem simulations for disks of varying thickness and fiber orientation distribution to investigate the thickness dependence the fiber orientation distribution 16 was kept fixed while h was varied it was observed that the ratio t b h 2 is constant this property is typical of composite laminates where the lam inar thickness can be changed freely without affecting the thermo elastic properties conversely injection molded disks of different thickness will also show a different fiber orientation distribution and hence material properties in the following we will thus focus on composite laminates in our formulation the buckling temperature for a laminate of total thickness hl is given by equation 9 after some rearrangements t b h 2 l c h 2 d h 3 1 r 2 a 0 c 0 k 2 0 a 0 b 0 k 1 0 b 0 c 0 c 16 all the terms on the right including c depend on the material parame ters and relative layer thickness only the integrals involved in the defini tions are already normalized by the appropriate power of h and the ra tio d h 3 is independent of h too this confirms the numerical results of kikuchi and koyama 1996 b the previous equation also highlights the de pendence on the disk radius r as c r 2 is independent of r the second part of kikuchi and koyama 1996 b focuses on the relation be tween t b h 2 l and the average thermal anisotropy ratio r l by per forming fem simulations of disks with various thicknesses and fiber ori entation distributions it was shown that linear correlations exist between t b h 2 l and r l in the intervals 0 26 r l 0 75 and 1 78 r l 2 20 separately this is shown in figure 3 together with the r squared values for each fit the two linear functions where combined in the following general expression t b h 2 l a r l b c exp 1 r l 1 17 17 the values of the coefficients a b and c in each r l interval are given in the original publication the exponential term was introduced to reproduce the divergent behavior of the buckling temperature around r l 1 we will now show that our formulation allows to derive analytically a different relation which improves the fit to the experimental data and includes the asymptotic behavior near r l 1 since the attention is put on the average thermal anisotropy ratio the disk can be analyzed with our previous single layer formulation where the ra tio of the coefficients of thermal expansion was indicated by 2 r l evaluation of equation 16 for a single layer yields t b h 2 l c k r r l 1 r l 18 where c is a function of the ratio of the elastic moduli the geometric average of the poisson s ratios and of the coefficients of thermal expansion k and of the disk radius r in principle the value of c depends on the considered data point of figure 3 as each simulation refers to a different fiber orientation distribution this is evident when comparing data points for r l 1 and r l 1 t b h 2 l should be always positive implying that in the first case c 0 whereas in the second c 0 the lack of detailed information about the thermo elastic parameters in each simulation does not allow to better quantify the c dependence on them which is also partially hidden in the numerical calculation of c however let us assume that the dependence is weak in the two regions r l 1 and r l 1 separately 18 so that the following approximation holds t b h 2 l c 1 r l 1 r l r l 1 c 2 r l r l 1 r l 1 19 the constants c 1 and c 2 are positive and they are determined by fitting the experimental data of figure 3 yielding c 1 7 88 and c 2 14 21 the fitted function is plotted on the same figure together with its statistical coefficient of determination r squared when r l 1 the fit to the fem results is excellent with an r squared value higher than that of the linear fit it can thus be concluded that the dependence of c on the thermo elastic constants is weak for r l 1 and the proposed model of equation 19 is accurate when r l 1 the r squared value drops from 0 997 to 0 609 indicat ing that the dependence of c on the thermo elastic parameters might be stronger than for r l 1 as mentioned earlier the statement cannot be further validated analytically as c is the solution of a generalized eigenvalue problem and scarce information about the fiber orientation distribution for each simulation is provided nevertheless the proposed fit extends the lin ear one of equation 17 to the whole interval r l 1 even though more data is needed to better determine its accuracy the divergent behavior for r l 1 is already incorporated in the choice of the fitting function in equation 19 and does not need to be accounted for with the introduction of corrective terms 4 conclusions the thermal buckling of thin injection molded frp plates has been inves tigated via an analytical approach based on the fo ppl von ka rma n theory 19 the presence of short glass fibers is modeled by using cylindrical orthotropy with thermo elastic material parameters varying through the disk thickness the formulation was further specified for a skin core skin geometry it was shown that for injection molded disks there exists a value iso of the core to total thickness ratio for which the disk can be considered macroscopically isotropic i e no buckling occurs the period of the first buckling mode is determined by the predominant fiber orientation as described by the gen eralized thermal anisotropy ratio when 1 predominant radial fiber orientation buckling is axisymmetric coffee cup when 1 predominant tangential fiber orientation buckling is non axisymmetric of period sad dle when 1 also iso and no buckling occurs this result generalizes that obtained for uniform disks where the same description holds by replac ing with the elastic and thermal anisotropy ratios and respectively the skin core skin formulation was used for model validation on a case previ ously analyzed with a uniform fiber orientation distribution improvements in the accuracy of the predictions were obtained showing the importance of including a more detailed description of the fiber orientation distribution through the disk thickness based on analytical considerations the relations between buckling temperature disk thickness and thermal anisotropy were explored an expression correlating the normalized buckling temperature t b h 2 l to the thermal anisotropy ratio r l was proposed improving the modified linear fit previously proposed in the literature 20 figure 1 influence of on c and for cases i dashed line ii continuous line and iii dotted line the buckling mode is axisymmetric m 0 coffee cup when 1 and non axisymmetric of period m 2
