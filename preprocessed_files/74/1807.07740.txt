dynamics and self organization dated march 4 2022 the contact line of a liquid drop on a solid exerts a nanometrically sharp surface traction this provides an unprecedented tool to study highly localised and dynamic surface deformations of soft polymer networks one of the outstanding problems in this context is the stick slip instability observed above a critical velocity during which the contact line periodically depins from its own wetting ridge time resolved measurements of the solid deformation are challenging and the mech anism of dynamical depinning has remained elusive here we present direct visualisations of the dynamic wetting ridge formed by water spreading on a pdms gel unexpectedly it is found that the opening angle of the wetting ridge increases with speed which cannot be attributed to bulk rheology but points to a dynamical increase of the solid s surface tensions from this we derive the criterion for depinning that is confirmed experimentally our findings reveal a deep connection between stick slip processes and newly identified dynamical surface effects liquid drops on vertical glass windows frequently get stuck due to sub micrometric heterogeneities of the sur face indeed while a drop on a perfectly flat homoge neous surface will slide down under its own weight sur face defects result into pinning of the contact line and can give rise to a characteristic stick slip motion differ ent aspects of the depinning transition on rigid surfaces have been studied experimentally and theoretically 1 revealing critical phenomena 2 that are blurred by ther mal activation at the nanoscale 3 from an engineering perspective there is a continued effort in designing sur faces with low contact angle hysteresis for purposes of hy drophobicity self cleaning or anti fouling coatings 4 5 recently wetting of soft surfaces has generated a large interest the liquid like surface properties of reticulated polymer networks and brushes can offer nearly hysteresis free substrates 6 7 however despite the absence of hysteresis drops on these soft surfaces do exhibit a stick slip motion when forced to spread beyond a threshold velocity 8 11 this stick slip behaviour is highly un expected since the steadily moving contact line is not pinned to a material point of the solid but surfs a wet ting ridge created by the capillary forces located at the contact line this suggests a rather intriguing scenario of self pinning and subsequent depinning of the contact line from its own wetting ridge while stick slip motion was qualitatively correlated to the viscoelastic rheology of the substrate 8 9 or weakening of the wetting ridge 10 the current models predict a stable steady state motion even at large velocities 11 as such there is no explana tion why the contact line would depin from its own ridge and start a stick slip cycle in this letter we identify the origin of the stick slip transition using a direct high speed visualisation of the full wetting ridge during self pinning and depinning the fig 1 a schematic of the experimental setup a cylin drical cavity of gel is partially filled with water with an im posed velocity u b the shape of the gel can be accessed optically from the side the image was taken just after the contact line depinned from the old ridge left forming a new ridge right the liquid vapor interface is indicated by the dashed line c space time diagram showing the dynamics of the wetting ridge in steady state left and in the stick slip regime which is reached above a critical velocity uc right experiments reveal an increase of the solid angle at the ridge tip with contact line velocity which is interpreted as a dynamical increase of solid surface tensions we identify the criterion for the instability and as such reveal the origin of the stick slip motion the increased solid angle enables the contact line to depin from its ridge and rapidly slide down its own wetting ridge wetting ridge visualisation it is notoriously dif ficult to image the wetting ridge below the contact ar x iv 1 80 7 07 74 0 v 2 co nd m at s of t 2 9 o ct 2 01 8 2 line techniques such as confocal 12 or x ray mi croscopy 10 13 have provided excellent spatial reso lution but the rapid dynamics during stick slip motion constitute a challenge to overcome this we present the setup shown in fig 1 a consisting of a square block of transparent gel with a cylindrical cavity the block has a width of 10 mm the cavity diameter is 4 mm leaving about 3 mm of gel thickness these dimensions ensure a separation of length scales where the elastocapillary length is small compared to the thickness and the menis cus while the effect of gravity is still negligible the cav ity is partially filled with milliq water the contact line pulls the gel inwards creating an axisymmetric wetting ridge this setup allows to accurately trace the edge of the gel when observing from the side dashed rectangle in fig 1 a without the otherwise unavoidable optical distortions using a high speed camera 3200 frames per second and a long working distance microscope giving a spatial resolution of 1 0 2 2 m pixel we image the wet ting ridge and the stick slip motion with the necessary spatio temporal resolution a sample image is shown in fig 1 b which was taken during a rapid slip event after the contact line depinned from the ridge the im age reveals both the new wetting ridge right and the decaying old wetting ridge left the reticulated polymer used is a pdms gel dow corning cy 52 276 mixed at a 1 3 1 a b ratio the dynamic modulus is accurately described by g ig g 1 i n where the static shear modu lus g 265 pa 0 48 s and the exponent n 0 61 cf supplementary information 14 with the surface tension of milliq water 72 mn m this gives rise to the elastocapillary length g 0 27 mm which makes the wetting ridge easily accessible for optical microscopy we verified that the experimental aspects such as the surface tension of the water and the wetting ridge dy namics remain consistent over extended periods of time days even when leaving the water in contact with the pdms the motion of the contact line is imposed by fill ing the cavity at a constant volumetric rate using a sy ringe pump control parameter is the imposed averaged contact line speed u the opening angle of the solid ridge was measured at the micron scale within 3 by fitting the gel profile on both sides of the ridge cf supplemen tary information 14 the contact angle of the liquid was measured in a separate experiment using a sessile drop on a flat surface of the same gel of sufficiently large thickness from steady motion to stick slip cycles at small velocity u the contact line moves in a steady state as can be seen by the left space time diagram in fig 1 c this steady regime has been studied in previous works 11 15 19 which have shown that the motion is gov erned primarily by the viscoelastic dissipation inside the solid the speed at which a drop can spread thus de pends on the rheology of the solid as well as on the size fig 2 dynamical ridge shapes at different times during a stick slip cycle the coloured asterisks on the inset space time diagram denote the point in time the snapshot was taken time interval between snapshots 0 04 s of the wetting ridge where most of the dissipation occurs our prime interest lies in the high velocity regime where wetting is forced beyond a critical speed uc the contact line motion then turns unstable and results into a stick slip behaviour that we resolve in detail at the scale of the wetting ridge the space time plot of a stick slip cycle is shown in fig 1 c with the corresponding dy namic wetting ridges presented in detail in fig 2 at the start of a cycle the contact line depins from the wetting ridge and suddenly moves with a much higher ve locity over the substrate slip phase the first data in fig 2 red shows the profile just after depinning where we observe both the abandoned wetting ridge rounded tip left and the newly formed wetting ridge sharp tip right the old ridge is no longer pulled by the contact line and will decay over time the evolution of the new ridge can be followed by the subsequent profiles in fig 2 from dark blue to light blue the wetting ridge initially grows while also moving along the surface in contrast to the sudden depinning the transition to the stick phase is characterized by a continuous deceleration of the ridge the growing ridge causes more viscoelastic dissipation slowing down its motion at a later stage the wetting ridge becomes markedly asymmetric with a large rota tion of the ridge tip light blue finally the contact line depins and the stick slip cycle is repeated the speed during the slip phase is two to three orders of magnitude faster than during the stick phase fig 1 c slip velocities between 102 and 103 mm s are actually comparable to those measured during the wetting of a rigid surface 1 20 in this phase of rapid motion there is essentially no wetting ridge and hence negligible vis coelastic dissipation inside the solid during the slow phase the velocity typically remains larger than 30 of the critical speed uc 1 0 0 1 mm s therefore 3 fig 3 the solid opening angle s versus contact line speed u the red curve shows s for the steady state regime u uc accurately fitted by s s 0 u 0 31 black line the blue curve represents a stick slip cycle u uc the light blue part of the curve represents the decelerating part of the cycle where the wetting ridge is growing and the solid opening angle s is decreasing the dark blue part of the curve shows the accelerating part of the cycle up to the point of ridge detachment slip arrow inset zoom on the stick slip cycle with the arrows denoting the direction of time the contact line never really sticks to a material point of the substrate but rather creeps as for the stick slip associated with solid friction 21 the depinning from the wetting ridge cannot be ex plained as a simple consequence of the viscoelastic fric tion force namely classical stick slip in solid friction is due to the sharp decrease of the friction force with ve locity modeled in coulomb s law by a jump from static to dynamic friction the decrease of friction causes an overshoot of the speed of the slipping object which in turn induces the irregular stick slip regime however the gel used in these experiments presents a loss mod ulus increasing monotonically with frequency g n with exponent n 0 61 so that the dissipation in each material element and subsequently the effective friction force increases with velocity indeed theory based on linear viscoelasticity assuming constant surface tensions predicts a stable steady solution for all velocities 11 this calls for a more detailed investigation given below of how the contact line detaches from the wetting ridge dynamic surface tension the main surprise of the profiles in fig 2 is that the solid angle s at the tip of the wetting ridge is not constant but increases with veloc ity it will provide the key to the depinning mechanism figure 3 shows the dynamics of s for both the regime of constant velocity u uc and during the stick slip cycle u uc in the steady state regime red we observe a gradual increase with velocity from the static value 85 2 at equilibrium to 140 4 at the critical speed u uc the data is very accurately described by the fit s s 0 u 0 31 black a similar trend is observed during the stick slip cycle blue where u denotes the instantaneous contact line velocity the moment of slip is indicated by the arrow where the surface is very flat and we set s to 180 then as the contact line veloc ity decreases a decrease in s is observed that follows the same trend as in the steady state in first approxima tion at the minimum velocity s slightly undershoots the steady state curve in red subsequently the contact line velocity increases while s follows the steady state curve until depinning occurs and the cycle is repeated this unexpected increase of s with velocity can be interpreted as a dynamical increase of the solid surface tensions here we follow 12 22 where s is used to measure surface tensions based on the neumann condi tion for the contact angles this is a balance of forces applied to an elementary material system surrounding the contact line the liquid surface tension is coun teracted by the solid surface tensions respectively sv solid vapor and sl solid liquid by this argument we assume that the bulk viscoelastic stress cannot con tribute on small scales which is in fact consistent with the shear thinning nature n 1 of the gel this point can be quantified by estimating the bulk stress at a dis tance from the contact line the characteristic fre quency at which the material is excited by the moving contact line is v which for the present rheology implies a bulk stress g n g v n when computing the integral of viscoelastic stress from a dis tance up to the contact line we find g v n 1 n for shear thinning materials with n 1 this integrated stress vanishes in the limit 0 so ultimately capil lary effects prevail the cross over scale from bulk to surface is obtained from the balance which gives g 1 1 n v n 1 n for the gel used in our experiment this gives 10 m for u 5 mm s ensur ing that the measurement of s is indeed not obscured by bulk effects importantly the corresponding charac teristic frequencies are within the range that is accessible by bulk rheometry see supplement 14 depinning mechanism finally we demonstrate how the change in s is indeed responsible for depinning fig 4 a first we revisit the classical depinning from a rigid wedge 23 24 used as a model for topographic roughness on stiff solids panel i the contact line can slide off the ridge once the liquid angle with respect to the inclined edge exceeds the young s angle y that marks the wetting equilibrium any virtual displacement to the right with a lower angle will result in a restoring force that pushes the contact line back to the tip of the ridge the depinning criterion thus reads r y 1 where is the liquid angle with respect to the horizontal while r is inclination angle on the right of the wedge panel i a similar argument applies for depinning to the left which in the case of a rigid wedge gives rise a 4 fig 4 a mechanism for ridge detachment in the stick slip regime i a rigid defect the contact line depins as soon as the liquid angle with respect to the inclined edge r exceeds the young angle y ii on a soft wetting ridge with constant surface tensions the ridge rotates along with any change of the liquid angle in order to maintain a constant s iii depinning can only occur when s increases as a function of u b validation of the depinning condition 1 verified by plotting and r y versus contact line speed u the critical speed for depinning occurs when r y at which the contact line can detach from the ridge range of possible values for this is the source of con tact angle hysteresis on rigid topography for which 1 goes by the name of the gibbs inequality 25 for soft wetting ridges however the mechanics is fundamentally different for example no contact angle hysteresis is ob served 7 instead any change of the liquid angle is followed by a rotation of the ridge itself as is clearly visible in fig 2 in the absence of changes of surface tensions there is no depinning but instead foresees a stable steady motion at all speeds 11 in this case of constant surface tensions the solid angle s takes on a constant value dictated by the neumann balance and and r will always rotate by exactly the same amount to maintain a constant s panel ii by consequence the depinning criterion 1 will never be satisfied all this changes dramatically however when surface tensions al low for an increase of s and thereby reduce r enabling the contact line to slide off the wetting ridge panel iii this scenario for dynamics induced depinning is con firmed in fig 4 b where we verify the depinning crite rion 1 the blue data shows the increase of the liquid angle with velocity u this is compared to the angle relative to the right side of the ridge r y shown as the red data in accordance with recent work 7 12 26 we set y to a constant value measured from equilib rium the motion leads to a decrease of r that allows for a crossing of the curves that indeed coincides with uc fig 4 b this is direct evidence for the depinning criterion 1 as the cause of stick slip this mechanism does not involve any sudden failure of the neumann con dition as was suggested in 10 which is corroborated by the gradual evolution of s discussion and outlook in summary we revealed that the surface tension of a soft solid is a truly dynam ical quantity which has important consequences in con tact mechanics it provides the mechanism responsible for depinning and the rapid stick slip motion of drops on soft substrates the change in ridge angle s provides direct evidence for a dynamic coupling between the sur face tensions and the mechanical state of the substrate a similar variability of s and thus of the solid s surface tensions was recently observed for static drops when progressively stretching the substrate 12 22 this was attributed to the so called shuttleworth effect 27 29 where the surface tension depends on the elastic surface strain it is tempting to interpret the results of fig 3 along the same lines by considering the strain induced by the droplet motion indeed the motion of the contact line induces a rotation visible in fig 2 of the wetting ridge with respect to its more symmetric static shape this rotation leads to an increase of the stretch on the liq uid side and a decrease of the stretch on the vapour side however the observed change of s is found to change as u 0 31 while the rotation angle and its induced strain exhibits a much weaker dependence un dictated by the rheology exponent n 0 58 11 it is thus unlikely that the strain dependence of surface tension is sufficient to explain our observations in fig 3 the above considerations suggest that surface tension of such a polymer gel is a truly dynamic quantity that depends on the rate of strain at the surface as the con tact line passes by this opens the exciting perspective of surface rheological effects as is for example known for interfaces with surfactants 30 31 for the present case of cross linked polymer networks this will require a de tailed understanding of non equilibrium interfacial effects that find their origin at a scale smaller than the distance between cross linkers the observed time dependent sur face tension suggests as for thixotropy the possibility that the surface tension actually depends on a micro state variable that remains yet to be identified future work on surface effect in reticulated polymer network will have to focus on the micro physics of the problem we acknowledge discussions with j eggers

physique statistique umr 8550 ens cnrs univ paris diderot 24 rue lhomond 75005 paris 3 max planck institute for dynamics and self organization dated march 4 2022 in this supplemental information we provide experimental details on the measurement of the contact angles of the wetting ridge and on the rheology of the gel wetting ridge angle measurement as a first step we detect the edge of the gel from images such as shown in fig 1 of the main text using a subpixel measurement scheme for this we fit an error function of the grey values of a vertical cut around the edge where the inflection point is set to the subpixel height of the gel this leads to profiles shown in fig 2 of the main text the imaging scale of our setup is 1 0 m pixel or 2 2 m pixel depending on the series of experiments and we estimate the accuracy of the vertical position to be 0 5 m which is not limited by the imaging scale but by the optical resolution power and the recording noise unavoidably however the tip of the ridge will appear rounded because of the limited optical resolution of such kind of shadowgraphy setup the typical residual radius of curvature at the ridge tip that is extracted from the images is about 2 3 m independent of the imaging scale this indicates that the resolution is limited by the aperture numerical aperture 0 1 of the shadowgraphy setup and not the imaging scale this optical limitation blurs the discontinuity of the gel s orientation when crossing the contact line to accurately determine the solid angle s as reported in fig 3 of the main text we therefore fit both sides of the contact line and subsequently determine the discontinuity from the crossing of the fits fig 1 to perform the fit we first estimate the horizontal position of the contact line from the local maximum around the ridge we then use phenomenological fit functions that provide an accurate description of the local profile on either side of the contact line from the profiles in fig 2 in the main text it is clear that the wetting ridges present a strong asymmetry we therefore used different fits for the two sides to the right of the contact line on the side of the air the shape is fitted by the form y a b log c x to the left of the contact line on the side of the liquid a second order polynomial is used y a bx cx 2 for both fits the points around the maximum within the limit of optical resolution are discarded to account for the tip rounding 1 pixel on each side for the measurement with imaging scale 2 2 m fig 1 of this supplementary information shows a representation of the fitting procedure on a measurement with an imaging scale of 2 2 m pixel at u 0 45 mm s and s 135 using 60 datapoints to the left and the right of the detected ridge tip the fits have a norm of residuals of 5 9 10 6 for the blue fit and 1 5 10 3 for the red fit which are typical values panel c shows a zoom of the of the same fit the intersection of the two fitted curves gives a good estimate
