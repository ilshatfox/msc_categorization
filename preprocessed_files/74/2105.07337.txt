correspondence x w wxliang mail ustc edu cn d b bdy 1993 sjtu edu cn abstract a big challenge in current biology is to understand the exact self organization mechanism underlying complex multi physics coupling developmental processes with multiscale computations of from subcellular gene expressions to cell population dynamics that is based on first principles we show that cell cycles can self organize into periodic stripes in the development of e coli populations from one single cell relying on the moving graded nutrient concentration profile which provides directing positional information for cells to keep their cycle phases in place resultantly the statistical cell cycle distribution within the population is observed to collapse to a universal function and shows a scale invariance depending on the radial distribution mode of genetic oscillations in cell populations a transition between gene patterns is achieved when an inhibitor inhibitor gene network is subsequently activated by a gene oscillatory network cell populations with zebra stripes can be established with the positioning precision of cell fate specific domains influenced by cells speed of free motions such information may provide important implications for understanding relevant dynamic processes of multicellular systems such as biological development keywords cell fate decision multiscale computations positional information self organization zebra stripe 1 introduction the most fascinating thing in developmental biology is how a highly structured multicellular organism is developed from an initially homogenous zygote such a biological patterning is an intricate process that takes place at multiple time and space scales involving cell division cell differentiation and specification fate determination cell migration cell interactions and even cell death 1 to clearly understand such complex tissue level patterning processes from behaviors of individual cells is a long standing technical challenge for both experiments and theory as early as 1952 turing became the first to propose a mathematical model i e the reaction diffusion model to explain morphogenesis 2 local self enhancement and long range inhibition that are based on the diffusing and reacting chemicals usually termed morphogens have been derived and widely believed as the fundamental mechanism for biological pattern formation 1 12 due to their ability to explain self regulation and scaling of patterning which are key characteristics of developmental biology 13 with the increasingly deeper understanding of cellular activities the turing mechanism is being found far from adequate a big problem of turing models is that these models cannot directly treat individual behaviors of cells and have neglected the multi scale aspect of biological pattern formation this makes them hard to gain wide acceptance among experimental biologists due to the gap with the real case 14 therefore for current pattern formation theories more precise and quantitative multiscale models are in great need and being mailto wxliang mail ustc edu cn mailto bdy 1993 sjtu edu cn 2 created 15 17 in experiments to have a clear understanding of biological pattern formation some scientists utilized a bottom up approach to model pattern formation in cell populations by designing and building simple gene regulatory circuits in some simple model microorganisms 18 22 such an approach has greatly reduced the difficulty in understanding biological patterning principles however there is still a long way for this method to go to disclose the mechanisms behind many more complex developmental processes which also strongly needs the involvement of more powerful pattern formation models here we present first principle computations to further explore the pattern formation principle in cell populations naturally growing on a two dimensional plane we select e coli as the model cell in our multiscale discrete element model dem see supporting information for methods and the calibration with available experimental data 23 incorporating intracellular gene expressions in this study we mainly stress two basic developmental questions 1 how can a highly ordered spatial organization of cells be self established within a cell population 2 how can cell fate specific domains precisely positioning inside a cell population the first question is explored in sections 2 1 2 3 and the second is explored in section 2 4 our ultimate intention here is to provide possible new insights into relevant biological development through our explorations 2 results this section orderly presents the patterning regimes of cell cycles periodic gene expressions and zebra stripes we will see later that some parameters used in our multiscale physical model are tunable in a range and are not based on available experimental values see table 1 for the parameters defined in this article however this is a valid approach as the focus of this article is to show the potential behaviors of models the possible patterning ways and not to study their predictive power using specific experimental values some critical predictions produced by our theoretical models remain to be revealed through future experiments 2 1 spatial organization of cell cycles the spatial arrangement of cell fates within developing cell populations requires a clear understanding of population dynamic behaviors of individual cell cycles in the process growth and division cycle is the most basic behavior of cells with a number of physiological activities strongly linked fig 1 a illustrates several phases within one cell cycle of one e coli cell under the ideal steady state growth condition which precisely correspond to specific cell lengths or cell mass figs 1 b c 24 and physiological states such as dna replication levels 25 26 fig 1 c shows the correspondence between cell length lc and cell cycle phase c within multiple cell cycles the correlation between them is given by c 2 lc l 0 ldiv l 0 l 0 lc ldiv 1 where l 0 is the initiation length of one cell cycle and ldiv is division length of cells or the ending length of one cell cycle although some previous works were performed on the interplay between single cell growth cycle and intracellular gene expressions 28 31 little is known about their spatial population dynamics and properties under the impact of their living environment actually during the developing process from one single cell to tissue level cell populations growth resources nutrients that are available to individuals are often spatially heterogeneous due to their limited diffusion 25 32 growth resources have a direct determination of cell cycle time via influencing the synthesis rate of substances consequently the spatial heterogeneity of 3 resources will lead to the differentiation between cells fates inside a population 25 in this study we first explore the effect of spatiotemporal self allocation of growth resources on the population dynamics of cell cycles within expanding cell populations we grow one single cell on the solid agar under standard experimental conditions see fig 2 for relevant parameters we observe that when nutrients are unlimited cell cycles cannot be coordinated into the spatially structured packing during the development of the cell population fig 2 a since no graded position information is provided to cells all cells have the identical division cycle time in such a case cell cycles are independent of each other because of the random effect naturally happening to cell divisions of all the cells the spatial arrangement of cell cycle phases within the population is always disordered under limited nutrients cell cycles start to self organize into periodic stripe structures after the colony grows to a specific size fig 2 b 1 movie s 1 because in such a case cells can obtain the coordinated position information provided by the spatiotemporal self allocation of nutrients to lock into region specific fates during the early development stage 0 7 0 h reduced nutrients available to inner cells can be supplemented timely through the diffusion of those at outside so there is no big difference in cells growth conditions fig 2 b 3 and subsequent cells growth rates fig 2 b 2 with the further increase of colony size however inner cells are unable to obtain equally fair allocation of nutrients to keep pace with outer cells in cell division cycle phases due to the limited diffusion which leads to the sufficiently graded radial position information and subsequent differentiation between inner and outer cells cycle phases t 10 h movies s 1 to s 3 since the provided position information is radially symmetrical fig 2 b 3 stripes are always the closed curves encircling the center point of the population we next explore the initiation condition of patterning fig 3 a shows that during the development of the cell population self organized patterning initiates at a sufficiently sloped radial nutrient distribution we select the parameter cfront ccenter the proportion of the nutrient concentration at the colony front to that at the center point of colony to quantify this patterning condition fig 3 b shows that patterning starts once the proportion exceeds a specific critical value kc 3 simulations under various growth conditions further indicate that patterning generally needs higher kc at higher nutrient concentrations and uptake rates and lower nutrient diffusion constants figs 3 c e we further investigate the effects of some growth variables on the properties of stripe structures results show that an increased nutrient concentration and diffusion speed can lead to an increment in the wave length of cell size stripes l figs 4 a b while the increase of nutrient uptake rate could cause a reduction in wave length fig 4 c the shared outcome of variations of these variables is the change in the moving speed of nutrient distribution vn fig 4 d and also the expansion speed of cell populations fig s 1 simulations show there is a positive linear correlation between l and vn phase diagrams figs s 2 and s 3 also show that stripes of cell cycles can be established more readily under lower nutrient concentrations higher nutrient uptake rates and slower diffusion of nutrients 2 2 statistical distribution of cell cycles a simple characterization of the packing structure of cell states within the population is the statistical probability distribution of cell cycle phases in our study we observe that under unlimited nutrients the terminal probability density distribution of cell cycle phases within the population is periodically time variant despite various cell cycle times figs 5 a c movie s 4 but under limited nutrients the statistical distributions will gradually collapse to some specific curves with the establishment of more stripes figs 5 d f movie s 5 surprisingly these curves have a universal distribution which is independent of the wave length of stripe structures i e cell cycle distributions have a scale invariant dependence and can be well described with a 4 four parameter empirical function figs 5 g h p f a 1 be f e f 2 where f c c is the normalized cell cycle phase indicates the average over all cells in the population optimal fitting values are obtained a 0 7472 b 0 6120 14 81 and 0 5704 the function 2 captures the exponential tail at large f and the peak of the distribution near f 0 2 note that the scale invariant function 2 can be derived after only several cell cycle stripes are established within the cell population figs 5 d f this may indicate that the statistical distribution within a colony will step into a steady state soon after the starting of the cell cycle self organization although the colony expansion has not entered into a steady state fig s 1 b where under the limited nutrients the colony expansion speed continues to decline with time to zero besides the peak of the universal distribution locates at f 0 2 1 which means within one complete cell cycle stripe a high proportion of cells are fixed at the initial cell cycle phase moreover the collapse property of the statistical distribution of cell cycles e g the critical collapse speed is likely to be used to assess if a real cellular system is starting to diverge away from the over abundance of nutrients and enter into a cell cycle self organized regime 2 3 genetic pattern formation here we further explore the population dynamics of intracellular genetic oscillators which may play a significant role in controlling various biorhythms and regulating biological pattern formation like color patterns on animal skins several types of synthetic gene oscillators have been built in model microorganisms 33 34 and the repressilator was recently shown in spatial pattering 21 however the exact patterning conditions and properties of gene oscillators still largely remain poorly understood due to the limitation of experimental techniques and the lack of proper pattern formation theories as well 13 35 here we use the multiscale dem model to reveal underlying mechanisms of gene patterns in the development of cell populations through incorporating intracellular gene expressions supporting information we grow one single cell with the activator inhibitor ai gene regulatory network which has been engineered in e coli strains fig 6 a on the solid agar see fig 7 for parameters used for the current genetic kinetics within each cell with this gene oscillatory network each cell is able to switch its states between the low and high gene expressions fig 6 b gene expressions are often strongly coupled with cell s growth state to incorporate this effect intracellular gene oscillators are therefore forced to be shut down when cells growth rate reduces to a specific value stop in our simulations stop 0 5 h 1 unless otherwise stated we observed three modes of genetic patterns under various growth conditions different nutrient concentrations diffusion constants uptake rates and genetic oscillation cycle times to see figs s 4 s 6 for the patterning rules under varying growth conditions when gene oscillators in cells stop oscillating in the very early developmental stage of populations see the evolution of the growth rate of frontier cells front in fig 6 c 1 where the radial distribution of c in the population is in the low mode as in fig 6 d sector like gene patterns are produced the patterning principle of sectors is mainly the local genotype fixation arising from the self proliferation of cells which further leads to the establishment of cell lineages with the same cell fates at a large space scale movie s 6 when oscillators can persist for a long enough time and in the meantime the graded position information can be provided circular fringes are produced fig 6 c 4 movie s 7 which are in line with the previous experimental observation 21 the underlying patterning mechanism is similar to the pattern formation of cell cycles in fig 2 b the synchronization between gene expressions in pioneering cells of the population is guaranteed by the radially symmetrical position information that is produced by the radially graded nutrient distribution fig 2 b 3 when oscillation persists for a specific time and then ceases a synthesis of sectors and circular fringes will be produced figs 6 c 2 3 5 we provide further support for the mode transition of gene patterns for the same growth condition through modulating the parameter stop individually with the decrease in stop the mode of gene patterns transitions from sectors to circular stripes fig s 7 our results demonstrate that the stripe pattern formation requires the stable establishment of the graded radial distribution of c that crosses stop i e the hybrid distribution mode in fig 6 d besides the genetic oscillation cycle time to should also be long enough to obtain gene patterns with recognizable wave lengths as there is a positive correlation between the wave length and to fig s 8 in theory to should be larger than the patterning period of cell cycles 1 1 h shown in fig 4 d to have a direct knowledge about how cell cycle patterning affects genetic oscillation dynamics we present in fig 8 the simultaneous oscillations of cell cycles intracellular arac and laci in cells located in different parts of the colony under different growth conditions but the same gene expression dynamics the result suggests that there is a positive correlation between the spatial patterning of cell cycles and that of genetic kinetics the larger the wave length of the cell size stripe is the larger the wave length of the genetic stripe 2 4 gene pattern with bi stability the precise positioning of gene expression domains in cell populations is a big challenge for the current understanding of developmental pattern formation since the continuously graded morphogen gradients generated by diffusion are believed to be too messy to drive the tissue patterning in organisms 36 37 the typical case is the zebra stripe where pigment cells have only two fates white or black and are strictly segregated in space a single gene oscillatory system struggles to produce such periodic patterns with discontinuous discrete pigment domains see fig 6 an early guess for this problem is that different pigment genes are activated by a graded morphogen distribution that provides different position information in a concentration dependent manner with corresponding thresholds then cells adopt different fates at the signal levels which are below and above the thresholds the french flag model 38 however it is still a puzzle for this model why one gene cannot be activated on the higher morphogen transcriptional factor concentration if it can be activated at a lower level of concentration it is also hard to explain the periodicity of discrete domains like in zebra stripes with the french flag model moreover although many studies on early embryonic development have suggested that geometrical constraints genetic regulatory feedback apoptosis and cell cell and cell environment interactions are responsible for embryonic self organization 39 42 the self assembly process of cell fate specific domains in developing cell populations has still remained poorly understood in basic principles 43 the inhibitor inhibitor ii mechanism has been found to be able to exclusively lock cells fates into one of two fixed states activation or silence in an irreversible way to realize cell fate decisions 44 45 more recently in an in vivo study the necessity of a mutually inhibitory gene network consisting of wnt and sox 9 was observed in the precise digit patterning of mouse 46 we next investigate the formation mechanism of gene patterns with zebra stripes in expanding populations of discrete cells based on the combined aai ii gene regulatory network shown in fig 9 a in our simulations the ii subsystem is not started until a cell receives a starting signal c ii 0 our methodology for the current intracellular gene expression dynamics and parameters used are given in fig 10 we observe that with the current genetic regulatory mechanism periodic stripe patterns with only two states c or d are produced without having to shut down the gene oscillatory subsystem consisting of the aai network fig 9 b movies s 8 and s 9 how such gene patterns with discrete cell state specific domains can be established according to the messy spatial distribution of state transition signals a and b and also the continuously graded position information provided by the nutrient distribution within the population in 6 our study we found that in the development of cell populations the operation of aai subsystem in cells can stably provide the alternative signal level high a or high b for the cells around a given position c ii 0 fig 9 c movie s 10 despite the spatial disorder of signals a and b within the whole cell population movie s 11 since the ii subsystem locks a cell into one specific fate in a wide range of relative input signal level not based on the absolute values of signals a little difference in the oscillation cycle phases of transition signals inside those cells would not have a big impact on the coordination among their fate decisions in this case according to the alternative fate switching signals moving like traveling waves all the cells who receive a high level of a or b signal around that radial place then make the same fate decision and precisely self organize into the specific c or d pigment region by means of the ii regulatory system fig 9 c this also suggests that the fate region width scales with the expansion speed of cell populations and also the oscillation cycle time of state transition signals the precision of region specific cell fate positioning is influenced by the parameter ii 0 fig 9 e this is because that higher ii 0 means the fate decision making at the position closer to the colony front where cells have a higher velocity for free motions fig 9 d in this case the coordination in the location of cells receiving the a or b signal at the place will be reduced and the degree of mixing between pigment c and d cells is subsequently enhanced suggesting the importance of slow free motions of cells in precise biological patterning in embryonic development slow free motions of cells correspond to a large degree to cell adhesion 41 this result may provide important implications for us to understand the embryonic development of multicellular organisms such as the development of animal spines 3 summary and discussion at present the elementary self organization mechanism of biological pattern formation is widely believed as the local self activation and lateral long range inhibition which is derived from a continuum theory for only two interacting and diffusing chemicals i e the turing model although this mechanism has become a tenet in biology for several decades as it spontaneously drives pattern formation it might be inaccurate for complex biological development which usually involves multi physics and multi scale processes in case of e coli strains we develop a first principle computational model for the development of cell populations which is able to incorporate individual cellular behaviors on different time and space scales including cell growth and division cell movement and intracellular gene expressions compared with the turing model this approach is more precise but needs a huge amount of computations we show here that spontaneous biological patterning within the cell populations developed from one single cell is driven by the graded position information that is produced by the nutrient depletion with activators and inhibitors not required to diffuse through cell populations activators not required to be self enhanced either according to the moving positional information produced by diffusion cell cycles and periodic gene expressions can self organize into stripe structures within cell populations with some necessary conditions satisfied the establishment of genetic stripes requires the stable graded radial distribution of c that crosses stop besides we also observe that under unlimited nutrients the cell cycle distributions produce periodic transitions between different modes of cell cycle however this behavior is completely different in nutrient deficient conditions where a scale invariant dependence of cell cycle distributions emerge and can be described by a 4 parameter empirical function another important developmental question is about the precise establishment of specific gene expression domains within a cell population although the early french flag model proposed that this problem can be solved if different genes are activated according to corresponding thresholds it might have problems in its self consistency here we show that with the involvement of an ii gene regulatory network that is activated 7 by a gene oscillatory network cells are able to interpret messy gradients of fate transition signals into region specific cell fates a key secret behind is that cells make the same fate decision according to the relative not the absolute values of signals our results also show that the speed of free motions of cells has a significant impact on the precise cell fate positioning these findings may provide us deeper insights into the relevant natural biological pattern formation the next step of our work is to include more details of subcellular events and cellular signaling network such as the gene regulatory mechanism at the molecular level and the cell cell signaling mediated via molecules or even electrical and mechanical signals these details may improve our understanding of complex pattern formation greatly references 1 a j koch h meinhardt rev mod phys 1994 66
