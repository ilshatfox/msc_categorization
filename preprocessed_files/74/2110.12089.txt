marne france art icle info keywords viscous thin shell cell cortex active gels morphogenesis abstract the cell cortex is a thin layer beneath the plasma membrane that gives animal cells mechanical resistance and drives most of their shape changes from migration divi sion to multicellular morphogenesis it is mainly composed of actin filaments actin binding proteins and myosin molecular motors constantly stirred by myosin mo tors and under fast renewal this material may be well described by viscous and con tractile active gel theories here we assume that the cortex is a thin viscous shell with non negligible curvature and use asymptotic expansions to find the leading order equations describing its shape dynamics starting from constitutive equations for an incompressible viscous active gel reducing the three dimensional equations leads to a koiter like shell theory where both resistance to stretching and bending rates are present constitutive equations are completed by a kinematical equation describing the evolution of the cortex thickness with turnover we show that tension and moment resultants depend not only on the shell deformation rate and motor activity but also on the active turnover of the material which may also exert either contractile or ex tensile stress using the finite element method we implement our theory numerically to study two biological examples of drastic cell shape changes osmotic shocks and cell division our work provides a numerical implementation of thin active viscous layers and a generic theoretical framework to develop shell theories for slender active biological structures 1 introduction biological cells can exhibit a large diversity of shapes which are intimately linked to the multiple key functions they perform division polarisation apoptosis i e programmed death or migration dynamic changes in the shape of animal cells also called morphogenesis is mainly controlled by the cell cortex a densemeshwork of filaments underlying the plasmamembrane capable of generating internal active tensions and torques 1 the cell cortex is a thin biological structure of few hundreds of nanometers in thickness that extends over several tens of micrometers the typical cell size 2 it is composed of semi flexible actin polymers actin binding proteins and myosin molecular motors which are the substrates for various phosphorylation events keeping this material out of equilibrium 3 by continuously hydrolyzing atp adenosine triphosphate into adp adenosine diphosphate and inorganic phosphate actomyosin networks have two remarkable proper ties which are relatively unusual in classical mechanics first they are under permanent renewal principally through the assembly and disassembly of filaments which happenswithin seconds this fast material turnover releases elastic stresses accumulated in the network making this material viscous on timescales longer than corresponding author e mail addresses hudson borja da

polytechnique edu mailto jeremy bleyer enpc fr mailto herve turlier college de france fr shell theory of the cell cortex a few dozens of seconds 4 second they are the subject of internal active loads created by molecular mo tors which exert contractile traction forces on neighboring filaments this creates a source of active stress that is continuously dissipated and renewed leading overall to an effective surface tension at the cell level 5 6 7 8 it can also lead to structural rearrangements of actin filaments within the plane of the cell s sur face which has motivated the recent emergence of active gel theories 9 relying on mass and momentum balance and exploiting the fundamental symmetries of the system active gel theories extend hydrodynamic theories for nematic or polar liquid crystals 10 to account for the activity of motors and to a certain ex tent for the renewal of the material 11 9 they have provided a convenient generic theoretical framework to describe the large scale mechanical properties of active materials through hydrodynamic variables the cortex mechanics is consecutively described in general by two sources of stress an active stress which is controlled spatiotemporally by the cell metabolism and depends on the local filament organization and a passive stress which results from the viscoelastic deformation of the network in response to external loads and internal active stress this theoretical framework has proven its ability to capture the essential physics characterizing the morphological changes observed experimentally in single cells 5 6 7 12 13 14 15 16 because of the slender character of the cell cortex around 0 2 2 m in thickness 17 2 for a typical cell radius of 10 100 m it is reasonable to adopt thin shell theories to model its mechanics at the cell level 18 19 shells are considered thin if their thickness is much smaller typically by one order of magnitude or more than other characteristic dimensions such as the curvature radius the main goal of thin shell theories is to reduce the three dimensional equations into an equivalent two dimensional model which is generally defined onto the midsurface i e the surface that splits the shell into two layers of equal thickness at any point although different choices of reference surfaces are possible 20 21 to perform this dimensional reduction two generic approaches are usually undertaken one may calculate the limit as the slenderness parameter goes to zero of the the nonlinear 3 d model using asymptotic methods alternatively one may restrict from the beginning the range of admissible deformations and stresses used in the nonlinear 3 d shell model by means of generally ad hoc assumptions for instance the kirchhoff love hypothesis 22 even though the passive response of the cortex is essentially viscous at the timescale of interest we expect here our viscous active shell model to be closely related elastic plates and shell theories which have been extensively studied in solid mechanics this is due to the stokes rayleigh analogy which states that the equations of slow viscous flow and linear elasticity are interchangeable in the incompressible limit if velocities replace displacements and strain rates replace strains 23 24 25 26 for a more detailed introduction on elastic shell theories we refer to classic textbooks 27 28 29 30 for viscous materials only a limited number of thin sheet models have been previously derived a fewmembrane models in which bending resistance is neglected have been developed in arbitrary shapes 31 32 but models accounting for bending resistance were mostly derived for specific geometries 33 34 35 with one exception in general curvilinear coordinates 36 relying on an asymptotic approach this last study constitutes the starting point of our active shell theory for the cell cortex most of the recent works on dynamic cell shape changes have considered the mechanics of the cortex modeled as an active and viscous surface equipped with tensions only 37 7 38 39 other works have focused on the lipid bilayer or plasma membrane mechanics onto which the cortex is attached through specialized linker proteins which is generally described as a 2 dimensional fluid layer equipped with an elastic bending rigidity 40 41 42 43 44 45 lipid bilayers may indeed be regarded as a stack of two lipid monolayers of nanometric thickness that do not flow transversely which justifies why viscous dissipation is inherently 2 dimensional in that case here we argue that the lipid bilayer contribution to cell mechanics is generally negligible and we focus on the cortex the cortex present several features that justify the need to derive a proper thin viscous shell theory starting from 3 dimensional constitutive equations first the cortex is a bulk continuous material with a thickness that may vary along the cell s surface which is in contrast to the classical assumption of constant thickness in thin elastic shell theories 46 or lipid bilayers second the hudson borja da rocha et al preprint submitted to elsevier page 2 of 37 shell theory of the cell cortex turnover of cortical material is not homogeneous along the transverse sheet direction polymerization hap pens mainly at the lipid bilayer surface through membrane attached actin nucleator proteins called formins 47 while depolymerization acts in bulk idealistically at each filament ends 48 as commonly described we assume that this mode of turnover breaks the symmetry of the shell with respect to its midsurface by cre ating an inward flux of actomyosin toward the cell interior as depicted schematically on fig 1 this flux can potentially generate tangential viscous flows of cortical material and therefore and additional active source of stress that has been neglected so far third pure membrane models of the cell surface cannot handle compressive forces nor active torque generation that may lead to surface buckling finally if active gel the ories provide relevant bulk constitutive equations for cortical material the mathematical form of equivalent two dimensional stress and torque resultants after dimensional reduction is hard to guess readily figure 1 schematic representation of the cell cortex composed of actin filaments and actin binding proteins in particular myosin molecular motors the cortex forms a thin layer of thickness t r 0 beneath the plasma membrane where r 0 is the typical curvature radius of the cell it is under permanent turnover with a polymer ization flux vp from the plasma membrane surface and a depolymerization rate kd in the bulk of the layer the dimensional reduction into a thin theory theory consists in finding the two dimensional approximate in plane and transverse shear stress n and q and torque m resultants defined on the middle surface of the shell this paper proposes therefore a general thin active viscous shell theory that aims to predict how the shape of a cell responds to arbitrary loads the load can be internal such as gradients of active stress or external originating from the mechanical interaction of the cell with its environment extending to active gel materials a previous covariant description of thin viscous shells 36 we present a systematic asymptotic expansion of governing equations in powers of a slenderness parameter t 0 l where t 0 and l are respectively the characteristic thickness and a length scale over which the flows varies across the sheet for a cell l is typically its radius r 0 and the thickness is fixed by turnover t 0 vpkd see fig 1 we start from three dimensional active gel constitutive laws and mass balance equations the expansion is performed in two limits stretching and bending dominated which are then combined to build an ap proximate two dimensional model that is valid for the whole range of intermediate behaviors following the generic method of matched asymptotic expansion 49 the two dimensional model is complemented by a kinematic equation describing the evolution of the thickness aiming at facilitating the spread modifica tion refinement of our model and to highlight its features we furthermore devise a numerical scheme 50 available on https github com virtualembryo active viscous shell to solve the 2 dimensional thin shell equations with the finite element library fenics 51 and we illustrate numerically two drastic dynamic cell shape changes cell division and osmotic shocks the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we start by introducing our notations and provide a summary of differential geometry and kinematics for surfaces and shells in section 3 we introduce the general governing equations the linear momentum balance in three dimensions and resulting generic stress resultants and torque

viscous shell shell theory of the cell cortex the mass balance with turnover follows in section 4 the core of the theory with the dimensional reduction of constitutive equations by asymptotic expansion which we perform successively in the membrane and inextensional limits based on preliminary scaling arguments then we introduce a variational formulation of our problem in section 5 and we derive the kinematic evolution equation for the thickness in section 6 we summarize the main equations of the model in section 7 and detail the numerical scheme employed to solve 2 dimensional thin sheet equations in section 8 we illustrate numerical results for osmotic shocks and cell division in section 9 and discuss in the light of future perspectives to extend our theoretical and numerical approaches in the dicussion section 10 the appendix contains more detailed calculations and numerical values used for simulations 2 differential geometry and kinematics of surfaces and shells

parametric domain is mapped to a unique a material point x on the surface let be a surface embedded in 3 e g the middle surface of the shell we describe surfaces paramet rically that is we choose a set of coordinate variables 1 2 in a parametric domain 2 and let each of the ambient coordinates x 1 x 2 x 3 of a material point x depend on x x this corresponds to a mapping of the point 1 2 in the parametric domain to a point on the material domain see fig 2 this mapping is supposed to be an infinitely differentiable homeomorphism are curvilinear coordinates on the surface and are non orthogonal in general we must therefore distinguish between covariant and contravariant components of tensors at every point in the surface of the patch the parametrization defines in plane covariant tangent vectors a x x 1 the comma denotes the partial derivative with respect to a variable for tangential vectors to form a co variant vector basis a we furthermore suppose them linearly independent at any point of the surface the contravariant basis vectors a are the reciprocals of the covariant basis and are defined by the relation 1 the index appears only twice once as a superscript upper

contravariant metric tensors of the surface are defined from basis vectors as a a a and a a a respectively these tensors allow one to generalize the notion of dot product on curved surfaces and may also be employed in lowering and raising index of tensors for instance c a c a c the determinant of the covariant metric tensor is a det a a 11 a 22 a 12 a 21 the unit normal of the surface at any point x is defined by n a 1 a 2 a 1 a 2 2 while the normal is a unit vector the same is not true for the tangent vectors which generally are neither of unit length nor perpendicular to each other the second fundamental form of the surface is called the curvature tensor defined as b a n and is symmetric b b a n it quantifies the extent of local curvature of the surface in the embedding three dimensional space in a curved manifold the coordinate system is position dependent as well as the tensors living on this manifold the covariant derivative accounts for the position dependence of the coordinate system and extends the notion of derivatives to curved surfaces producing tensors out of tensors the resulting tensor is one covariant order greater than the original tensor covariant

27 the middle surface is the two dimensional surface that is equidistant at any of its point to the upper and lower shell boundaries the euclidean space in which the surface is embedded is generally called the ambient space we suppose that the midsurface is everywhere continuous infinitely differentiable and of arbitrary shape in this text we follow closely the notation of 28 to which we refer the reader for a more in depth discussion the midsurface is described by a position vector x t relative to an arbitrary origin through general ized coordinates we introduce a third coordinate 4 z t 2 t 2 measured along the unit normal n a 3 t defined at each point of the midsurface so that z 0 is the midsurface and the thickness t t is a general function of see fig 3 then the position of an arbitrary material point of the shell r z t is defined by the equation r z t x t zn t 4 the covariant basis vectors at an arbitrary point in the shell are defined as g r a zb a a and g 3 n 5 2 note that this definition of the christoffel symbols suppose a torsion free manifold levi civita connection 3 objects that can be constructed without reference to any coordinate systems are called invariants or geometric scalar fields vectors and tensors are examples of geometric objects 4 derivatives with respect to the normal coordinate will be denoted as z 3 hudson borja da rocha et al

derivation may be found in more detail in classical books on elastic shell theory 27 28 we adopt mostly the notations employed by 28 to which we refer for more details at the scale of cells the reynolds number is very small and we are interested in deformations at low fre quencies such that inertial and convective terms in thenavier stokes equation are negligible 54 therefore all equations below will be written neglecting inertia we assume that the distribution of stress throughout the sheet is characterized by the stress tensor in equilibriumwith bulk forces f described by the inertialess cauchy s equation of motion div f 0 9 hudson borja da rocha et al preprint submitted to elsevier page 6 of 37 shell theory of the cell cortex the voss weyl formula 52 expresses the

10 where ij is the cauchy stress tensor and f j are the contravariant components of volume forces these stresses must be expressed both per unit area of a single reference surface and relative to base vectors that do not vary across the thickness of the sheet the natural choice for this purpose is the midsurface and its intrinsic base vectors ai if we use g a g 3 n the equilibrium equations can be rewritten in thefollowing form 28 b 3 3 3 f in plane equilibrium 11 a 3 b 33 3 f 3 out of plane equilibrium 11 b where i i and i 3 i 3 12 are tangential and transverse stress tensor components referred to the midsurface notice that ij is not symmetric moreover because of the symmetry of ij it follows that 3 3 3 1 the cell cortex bulk equations 3 d constitutive relations the cell cortex is often described as an active polymeric gel 55 polymer gels are cross linked networks formed by linear or branched polymers in the cell cortex actin polymers are furthermore permanently renewed by polymerization depolymerization which releases elastic stresses over timescales of dozens of seconds 48 4 the cell cortex is therefore often described as amaxwell viscoelastic material responding elastically on short timescales and viscously on longer times 11 the cell cortex differs from physical gels in which it is an active material it is out of equilibrium continuously consuming energy in the form of atp here we work in the viscous regime of cortical behavior and start from viscous active nematic gel equations 11 56 12 which consider the stress to be the sum of a passive viscous term and an active stress exerted bymyosin molecular motors in the network pas act the viscous response is modeled as a newtonian fluid ijpas pg ij 2 gikgjlekl 13 where p is the hydrostatic pressure is the shear viscosity of the actomyosin gel and eij 1 2 gi u j gj u i 14 is the three dimensional strain rate tensor and u z t is the lagrangian fluid velocity of the shell the cell cortex generates internal stress from the action of the motor protein myosin myosin motors can walk along actin filaments driven by the hydrolysis of atp when assembled into minifilaments and associated with several actin filaments they induce internal stresses in the actin network see fig 4 while the detailedmicroscopic processes for the generation and renewal ofmotor generated stress are complex 57 they lead most generally to contractile stress in actomyosin networks 58 55 an effect which is akin in first approximation to a negative pressure the contractile activity is controlled spatiotemporally by cells by hudson borja da rocha et al preprint submitted to elsevier page 7 of 37 shell theory of the cell cortex actin myosin figure 4 cortex as an active gel the myosin transforms the energy of atp hydrolysis into mechanical work local phosphorylations of myosin chains through various biochemical pathways such as the rhoa pathway 59 as a result of motor activity or viscous flow actin filaments may also acquire a structural organization within the cortex 60 61 that is generally measured by a director field t see fig 5 b and described with a polar or nematic 5 order parameter 11 12 while actin filaments turn over fast the maintenance of a local orientation may be linked experimentally to crosslinking 62 or filament guided de novo assembly 63 the active gel theory predicts an active stress contribution of the general form ijact q ij 15 where is the gain in chemical free energy for one atp molecule hydrolysis 0 is a measure of the local motor contractile activity 11 at this point we do not specify any particular form of the tensor qij which can represent nematic or polar order 6 note that we neglect here the contribution of the conjugate field a classical passive term in polar or nematic hydrodynamic theories that reflect the restoring forces deriving from elastic energy penalizing gradients of filament orientations the frank oseen energy 10 the bulk constitutive relation is written in its contravariant form ij pgij 2 gikgjlekl g ikgjlqkl 17 where we introduced to simplify notations the magnitude of the actively generated stress in the cortex which has to be positive

balance the actomyosin cortex is under permanent turnover the polymerization of new actin monomers happens mostly at the surface in contact with the plasma membrane at z t 2 creating a flux of actin inwards the cell at a velocity vp kp a where kp is the rate of polymerization and a the typical size of a monomer the depolymerization of the actin may happen through different mechanisms 48 5 in contrast to polar order the nematic phase is described by the breaking of rotational symmetry but not translational symmetry in the nematic phase the molecules are randomly polarized but their long axes are oriented on the average along a particular direction specified by a unit vector t see fig 5 6 in the nematic case one can further divide the contractile stress in an isotropic and deviatoric components this is done by simply decomposing qij such that ijact g ij q ij gij isotropic q ij deviatoric 16 the local orientation of actin filaments is measured by a traceless nematic tensor q ij titj 1 3 ij where represents a local mesoscopic average over the orientation of the filaments in a elementary mesoscopic volume 10 64 and the orientation of each filament being characterized by a unit

section of the cortex containing the normal to the midsurface the actin filaments are mainly organized parallel to the midsurface the addition of new actin monomers happens at the surface in contact with the plasma membrane while the depolymerization happens uniformly across the cortex thickness b in the tangent plane the vector t represents the average orientation of an actin filament here we suppose that depolymerization is a bulk process that essentially happens at each free filament end where monomers depolymerize at a rate kd see fig 5 a supposing actomyosin density uniform across the membrane bulk mass balance reads div u kd vp z t 2 18 where the delta function constrains polymerization from the upper shell surface boundary z t 2 3 2 balance of stress and torque resultants the fundamental dynamic quantities of interest for a thin shell theory are stress resultants and bending moments which are integrals of the stress and torque across the sheet therefore we integrate the equations 11 with respect to z through the thickness of the shell and obtain n b q p 0 q b n p 3 0 19 where n t 2 t 2 dz q t 2 t 2 3 dz are the stress resultant tensor and transverse shear stress p t 2 t 2 f dz f f and p 3 t 2 t 2 f 3 dz f 3 f 3 with f j ij n i are the components of the stress applied in the direction aj to the sheet outer surface measured per unit area of the midsurface and 1 14 g t t 1 2 the outward unit normal vectors are n n i gi with n 1 12 t and n 3 1 to obtain the equation for the torque resultant we multiply 11 a by z then integrate across the sheet m q 20 where m t 2 t 2 z dz hudson borja da rocha et al preprint submitted to elsevier page 9 of 37 shell theory of the cell cortex is the bending moment tensor and t 2 t 2 f z dz t 2 f f is the applied moment vector next we then introduce the symmetric effective membrane stress tensor n n b m 21 and the symmetric effective moment tensor as m 1 2 m m 22 then we eliminate the shear stress resultant q using equation eq 20 and substitute 21 and 22 into 19 to finally obtain 27 n 2 b m m b p 0 23 a m b b m b n p 3 0 23 b where p p b and p 3 p 3 it is worth noting that the balance equations 23 are independent of the constitutive law for the shell they represent universal force balance equations valid for any 2 dimensional medium equipped with tension and bending moments and simply expresses the conservation of momentum such decomposition is classical in the theory of elastic shells 65 27 and was also used to model the dynamics of viscous sheets 36 moreover since inertia has been neglected time does not explicitly appear in the equilibrium equations or boundary conditions 4 thin sheet constitutive equations because we are deriving equations of a shell theory based on stress resultants eq 21 22 constitutive equations for these stress resultants have to be formulated these constitutive relations represent the stress field integrated over the shell thickness its formulation is not trivial since one must carefully consider the phenomenological three dimensional constitutive equations for the visco active material and for mass balance introducing the active turnover effects into the two dimensional constitutive relations we nowwish to exploit the slenderness of the cortex to obtain approximated thin sheet equations such an approach is valid when the slenderness parameter t 0 l 1 then we use asymptotic expansion in the small parameter and in z to express the effective stress n and bending momentm in terms of the midsurface velocity u u z 0 t u a u 3 n in the local basis a n more specifically the constitutive equations will depend on the two tensors that describe the rate of deformation of the midsurface the strain rate tensor which is one half of the time derivative of the metric tensor 2 da dt and therate of change of the curvature tensor which is defined as the time derivative of the curvature tensor db dt these tensors can be explicitly written in terms of midsurface velocity u as 36 1 2 u u b u 3 24 and u 3 b u b u b u b b u 3 25 the deformation rate of the middle surface is described completely by the pair of symmetric tensors and it is important to note that the rate of tangential stretching depends not only on the rate of surface strain u u 2 but also on surface shape changes in the presence of curvature b u 3 hudson borja da rocha et al preprint

element g a 1 2 h z g z 2 2 the dimensionless shift tensor z b and we approximate the contravariant metric tensor as g a 2 z b 2 in theories of thin sheets one often distinguishes between two main deformation modes that are highly dependent on the load applied to the system 7 in themembrane or stretching dominated regime the system responds mainly through stretching such that bending moments can be neglected while in the inextensional or bending dominated regime the dissipation issued from bending deformation rates becomes significant these two regimes are described by different scalings for velocity and stress components 34 66 32 in the membrane limit the velocities and stresses in a viscous sheet scale as 31 u pl p p 26 while in the inextensional bending regime the appropriate scaling is 33 36 u pl 3 p p 2 27 in order to cover both deformation modes within our thin sheet model we use the method of matched asymptotic expansions 49 which consists of finding approximate solutions separately in each limiting case and then combining these approximations giving an approximate constitutive relation that is valid for the whole range of intermediate behaviors 4 2

viscous sheet without couplings between bending and stretching moreover we note that the absence of transverse shear deformation at the lowest order in the asymptotic expansion induces a kirchhoff love type of deformation 8 for an initially curved elastic shell kirchhoff love deformations lead to a theory generally named after koiter 67 this can be readily seen since the passive parts of the resultants 42 and 43 are modulo a time derivative similar to the incompressible limit of koiter s constitutive equations for elastic shells 67 as one may expect from the stokes rayleigh analogy 9 5

velocities ui ui one can identify the resulting variational function as a rayleigh potential 68 69 which is the sum of the passive power dissipated by viscous forces and the power input of active terms 8 the kirchhoff love kinematical assumption states that the material line orthogonal to the midsurface in the undeformed configuration remains straight unstretched and orthogonal to the midsurface after deformation in our particular case the condition that the normal is unstretched is relaxed since we allow the shell to vary its thickness 9 the stokes rayleigh analogy addresses the similarities between the formulation of viscous and elastic problems it states that the equations for slow viscous flow derive from the equations of linear elasticity when velocities replace positions and strain rates replace strains 23 24 hudson borja da rocha et al preprint submitted to elsevier page 14 of 37 shell theory of the cell cortex in the absence of external forces the rayleigh potential

variational form expresses here simply the fact that viscous flowsminimize dissipation 54 a generalization of such approach for dissipative systems to include other sources of dissipation but also reactive forces deriving from a free energy is often named onsager variational principle in soft matter physics 70 71 6 evolution of the sheet thickness to obtain the equation of evolution for the

element solution scheme used for the numerical sim ulations note however that computational aspects of the viscous thin shell theory are not the primary purpose of the present work the proposed implementation will therefore be limited to simple geometrical settings which excludes non manifold surfaces for instance for more details on the practical numerical hudson borja da rocha et al preprint submitted to elsevier page 16 of 37 shell theory of the cell cortex implementation aspects we refer to the documentation of the source code released with the paper 50 for viscous membranes a few numerical implementations have been recently proposed based either using finite element models 72 39 or discrete geometric approaches computer graphics 73 25 yet no numerical work has been dedicated to implementing viscous thin shells in generalized coordinates to our best knowledge let us first point out that thin shell theories based on the kirchhoff love kinematics are notoriously difficult to implement due to the system being of fourth order type which requiresc 1 continuity of the approximating finite element discretization fields to avoid kinks leading to infinite bending energies since this cannot be achieved with standard 0 finite elements one has to resort to either dedicated or complex finite elements 74 75 30 or isogeometric analysis approaches 76 to circumvent the difficulty of handling 1 conforming elements one may also relax the underlying thin shell hypothesis and solve an equivalent shearable shell model 77 which requires only 0 continuity the use of such a shearable thick shell instead of unshearable thin shell kinematics must however consistently converge to the latter in the thin shell limit 0 in such thick or naghdi type shell models the shell cross section does not remain normal to the shell surface any more additional degrees of freedom are introduced in the form of inextensible directors these inextensible directors are allowed to deviate from the surface normal during the deformation hence accounting for transversal shearing of the shell across the thickness more simple 0 elements can then be considered in the case of thick shell kinematics for the both displacement velocity and director fields however shear locking issues are prone to arise in the thin shell limit requiring the use of dedicated numerical techniques such as mixed methods to circumvent the locking issue 78 79 our simulations were conducted along these lines by relaxing the thin shell hypothesis in the numerical implementation by considering a director field d which contrary to n is not necessarily normal to the shell midsurface see fig 6 strain measure expressions need then be adapted with d instead of n since the shell cortex is in practice extremely thin we expect to recover the theoretical thin shell limit derived above by adding a penalization for the deviation between the normal n and the shell director d in the dissipation potential see eq 63 8 2 discrete shell geometry the discrete shell reference surface denoted byx is assumed to bemade of an assembly of flat triangular elements and d 0 n 0 denotes the reference shell director which we assume to initially coincide with the reference shell normal the reference metric tensor and curvature tensors are defined respectively as a 0 1 2 x x x x and b 0 12 x d 0 x d 0 79 in the current configuration the metric and curvature tensors are similarly given by a 12 x x x x and b 12 x d x d reference configuration current configuration figure 6 kinematic of the shearable shell model left generic point in the reference and current configurations of the shell midsurface right parametrization of the inextensible director d in terms of two independent euler angles 1 2 following 79 we assume the shell director to be unstretchable d 1 so that we parametrize the hudson borja da rocha et al preprint submitted to elsevier page 17 of 37 shell theory of the cell cortex unit director d by two angles 1 2 see fig 6 right giving rise a so called five parameter shell model 80 d 1 2 cos 1 sin 2 sin 1 cos 1 cos 2 59 note that this simple parametrization limits our implementation to non closed manifold surfaces we implement an updated lagrangian formulation in which the discrete equations are formulated in the current configuration which is assumed to be the new reference configuration in this setting we replace the def initions of the strain rate tensor 12 da dt and rate of change of curvature tensor db dt with theirlinearized expressions for the rate of deformation 79 1 2 x u x u 60 and 1 2 u d 0 u d 0 x x 61 where d dd dt is the rate of change of director and u dx dt in addition we must also consider the rate of shear strain x d 0 u 62 when 0 we recover that u 3 b u a then substituting into eq 61 we should retrieve exactly eq 25 which corresponds to the unshearable shell dynamics 10 as a consequence the new rayleigh potential density is modified to add a novel dissipation contribution penalizing shear u d n m ks pen t a 63 where ks pen is a shear penalization constant that we choose sufficiently large to ensure d n everywhere on the midsurface 8 3 finite element discretization at each time step we must solve for the shell midsurface velocity u and the new director d in fact we consider the rate of change of the parameters to be the main unknowns from which we also have sin 01 sin 02 cos 01 cos 02 cos 01 0 sin 01 cos 02 cos 01 sin 02 w 0 64 as a result we have a system with 5 degrees of freedom to solve at each time step three velocity components u 1 u 2 u 3 u and two angular rates of change 1 2 in the present work we do not follow the mitc discretization discussed in 79 to remove shear locking but rather use a much simpler finite element discretization namely a quadratic continuous p 2 lagrange interpolation for the velocity field u a linear interpolation with continuity enforced at the triangle mid sides crouzeix raviart element for the angular rates such a discretization choice is extremely simple and seems free of any shear locking effects as shown in 81 for nonlinear shells and 82 in the case of plate and shell limit analysis theory 10 we use the fact that u u b u 3 a u 3 b u n which comes from the decomposition of the velocity u in thelocal frame and the use of the gauss weingarten relations

65 where u tn s u tn da 66 is the total rayleighian of the system of surface density given by 63 here we assume no external loading on the shell such that all shell deformations are powered by internally generated active stresses note that due to the linear expressions of the strain rates 60 61 62 and the quadratic form of the dissipation potential the resulting system to solve is in fact linear 83 7 we then update the geometry in an asynchronous and lagrangian manner by solving the discretized thickness evolution equation and updating the midsurface position and director using 59 as

some biologically relevant model problems illustrating the partitioning of the sheet deformation between stretching and bending dominated modes in particular cell division and hypo osmotic shocks are mainly dominated by tensions whereas fast hyper osmotic shocks will be bending dominated in the following for the sake of simplicity we neglect local variations in the filament orientation within the cortex we furthermore suppose that filaments remain parallel to the cell surface which is a good approximation for the true organisation of actin in the cell cortex as observed experimentally 87 88 since we neglect tangential gradients of orientation filaments are supposed isotropically oriented along the midsurface see fig 5 to account for the isotropic organization of filaments along themidplane we assume a purely nematic form of the active stress tensor qij in 3 d with constant diagonal coefficients in the local midsurface basis a n 89 12 7 qij 1 6 0 0 0 1 6 0 0 0 1 3 73 in all generalityqij may also have an isotropic contribution however such isotropic term would appear only in active bending moments but not in membrane resultants we will see that in our two examples below osmotic shock and cell division that active bending moments play a negligible role in the shape dynamics and we therefore ignored such contribution to explicitly consider filament reorganization one may have to write down and expand a dynamic equation for the spatiotemporal evolution of this nematic tensor and its coupling to velocity gradients 11 12 9 90 91 which is out of the scope of this manuscript 9 1 osmotic shock here we mimic the response of a suspended cell to rapid osmotic shocks considering a cell in osmotic equilibrium with an external medium a sudden change in solute concentration creates an osmotic imbal ance that will generate a rapid flux of water across the cell membrane changing its volume until a novel equilibration of concentrations is reached if the solute concentration in the medium is increased the cell is subjected to a hyperosmotic shock causing an outward flux of water and cell shrinkage in contrast a decrease in solute concentration leads to an inward flux in the cell called hypo osmotic shock leading to its expansion for the sake of simplicity we don t intend here to solve for a realistic pump leak model of cell volume control involving electroosmotic effects 92 93 94 but we impose instead directly the variation of a target volume v t using the constraint 72 see figs 7 a and 8 we first consider an hypo osmotic shock where a solution may be calculated analytically we suppose that the cell s response is mainly in the membrane regime and that the volume can be externally controlled and is given by v t because the deformation is spherically symmetric the time evolution for the radius of the expanding cell reduces to r t 3 3 v t 4 in spherical coordinates the metric and curvature tensors are hudson borja da rocha et al preprint submitted to elsevier page 20 of 37 shell theory of the cell cortex a diag r 2 r 2 sin 2 and b diag r r sin 2 respectively moreover since 12 da dt we have for isotropic deformations diag rr rr sin 2 the thickness evolution eq 50 can be readily written as t t 2 r r kd vp t vp r 0 74 the first order differential equation 74 subjected to the initial condition t t 0 t 0 can be analytically solved for a given v t consequently givenr t the steady state thickness at a given cell radiusr is given by t 0 rvpkdr vp it slightly differs from the value vp kd value defined in 7 12 which is valid only in thelimit of a flat plate r it is corrected here by a curvature term vpht in the thickness evolution that comes from the asymmetry of the polymerization and the curved geometry of the sheet such simplified system can be used to validate the fem approach we impose a sigmoid volume variation v t and compare the analytical solution of 74 for the thickness t t with the solution obtained

homogeneous along the membrane it is interesting to note the geometric correction to laplace s law in t r in front of the pressure that is usually neglected for very thin shells or membranes in the approximation of slow volume change t 0 r 0 the above coupled equations at steady state reduce to p 2 r t f lat 0 1 2 4 kd t f lat 0 r 76 hudson borja da rocha et al preprint submitted to elsevier

spherical geometry p 2 r t f lat 0 2 12 7 is corrected by a term of order t r proportional to the turnover rate kd hyperosmotic shock to probe ourmodel in situationswhere bending dissipationmay become non negligible we study the effects of a rapid hyperosmotic shock on a cell here turnover acts as a stabilizing agent if the volume variation is slower than the typical turnover timescale the cell cortex will have the time to rearrange and adapt the cell s shape to its new volume without buckling we thus apply a sudden drop in volume that we model by a sigmoid function as illustrated in fig 8

represents the local thickness of the cell ta is the typical deformation timescale in our simulations shown in fig 8 we find numerically that active bending terms play a negligible role contributing to less than 0 1 of the total power input however passive bending terms are not negligible to compare the relative contributions to the dissipation of bending and stretching rates we define the following non dimensional parameter b b s b 1 3 t 3 da 4 t 1 3 t 3 da 77 which measures the relative weight of bending dissipation b 13 t 3 da to the total viscous dissipation in the shell s b where s 4 t da is the dissipation due to stretching the time course of the parameter b is plotted in fig 9 two distinctive peaks indicate a significant contribution of bending to dissipation which may reach up to 60 of the total interestingly these two peaks indicated by i and iii do not correspond to the most folded cell shape which rather lies at the minimum of the curve between these two maxima as indicated by ii this is because for a thin viscous sheet dissipation increases with the rate of curvature change but not with the curvature itself like one may be used to in elasticity therefore maintaining highly curved cell shapes does not cost energy but dissipation shall oppose rapid shape changes 9 2 cell division cell division encompasses two main processes in biology mitosis which corresponds to the even split ting of genetic material between the two future daughter cells and cytokinesis whereby the mother cell cy toplasm is physically cleaved in two 95 in the following we focus on the cell s shape deformation during hudson borja da rocha et al preprint submitted to elsevier page 22 of 37 shell theory of the cell cortex figure 9 plot of the relative contribution of the bending dissipation to the total dissipation the two peaks i and iii represent the instants in time for which the rate of curvature change is the highest even though at intermediary time ii the cell shape is overall much more curved bending dissipation is the lowest cytokinesis in animal cells cytokinesis is achieved through the ingression of a circumferential actomyosin furrow located at the equator of the cell while cortical tension at cell poles is resisting the deformation imposed by increasing cell pressure 96 7 various mechanical models of cell deformation over cytokine sis have been proposed in the last decades with different assumptions about the mechanical nature of the cortical material contractile 97 elastic 98 viscous 99 or viscoelastic 100 other approaches have considered the lipid bilayer mechanics only and attributed most of the mechanical dissipation to cytoplasmic and surrounding medium fluids 101 102 in some of these models a contractile ring structure of different nature is supposed to provide the constricting force at the cell equator 98 100 while in others the furrow ing is the natural result of higher but continuous activity in the equatorial region that may trigger possible structural rearrangements of the continuous cortical surface 97 99 in agreement with early hypotheses 103 recent active gel models of cytokinesis 7 and experiments 96 61 all point towards the continuum character of the cortex that may flow in amarangoni like process toward the equator as a result of contractile gradients and can reorganize structurally along the cell s surface in response to extensile and compressive forces in fact the hypothesis of surface tension gradients driving division is ancient and goes back to early observations of dividing marine eggs 104 105 106 and to the similarity of their shape to one of the olive oil droplets in response to surfactants 97 a gradient of contractility centered at the equator has indeed been measured from the cell poles to the cell equator in the form of a gaussian like spatial distribution of active rhoa a protein upstream of actomyosin contractility 107 following 7 we start from a spherical cell of radius r 0 and mimic the rhoa gradient by imposing a gaussian distribution of active stress along a fixed ambient coordinate direction x centered at the equator 0 0 e 1 2 x 2 w 2 78 where 0 is the basal level of stress that creates an active tension at poles and is called equatorial overac tivity that expands over a typical widthw in the initial state the cell is a sphere ofr 0 and uniform thickness t vp kd which is subjected to an uniform contractile activity 0 a typical deformation timescale in this system is the ratio of the viscosity to the contractile stress ta typical numerical values for all these parameters are extracted from experimental measurements referenced in the literature and may be found in table 1 following the rise of a gaussian over activity the equatorial region of the cell becomes more contractile and generates cortical flows toward the equator this triggers a local increase in the thickness which is partially counterbalanced by depolymerization as found in the mass balance eq 34 material turnover is indeed the essential factor ensuring the overall stability of the thickness evolution in presence of contractility or thickness gradients the accumulation of matter in the furrow here represented by the hudson borja da rocha et al preprint submitted to elsevier page 23 of 37 shell theory of the cell cortex increase in thickness increases further the contractile stress around the equator 11 the resulting contractile ring then pinches the cell leading to its constriction the time course for such dynamics is shown on fig 10 the spatial distribution of contractility is assumed here to be time independent but it may slightly vary with cell shape changes 107 the spatiotemporal evolution of the thickness and of the midsurface velocity field are illustrated at corresponding timepoints in fig 11 figure 10 dynamic shape changes of a cell during cell division cytokinesis illustrated by successive timepoints of furrow constriction the color scheme refers to the rescaled contractile activity signal 78 figure 11 dynamic evolution of the thickness and velocity field during cell division cytokinesis illustrated by successive timepoints of furrow constriction arrows represent the direction of the velocity field u the color scheme refers to the cortex thickness as for the osmotic shocks we find numerically that active bending plays a fully negligible role but in contrast to the hypoosmotic shock bending dissipation remains here also largely negligible during the time course of cell division not shown and the cell adopts very curved shapes in tje final stages of cytokinesis with almost no associated dissipation cytokinesis may therefore be well described by a simple membrane theory where tension is the dominating phenomena which justifies a posteriori the approach of 7 where an axisymmetric active viscousmembranemodel was employed to simulate cytokinesis as originally predicted in 7 we show that full constriction of the furrow leading to the completion of cell division depends on the level of equatorial over activity 0 presenting a threshold c below which the full constriction fails we plot in fig 12 b the bifurcation diagram for physiological values of the parameters each point in the figure represents the final radius following the dynamics as shown in fig 12 a with variable signal over activity even though the obtained results in 7 were qualitatively correct capturing well the shape changes for axisymmetric cell division the model neglected an essential stress contribution generated by active material de polymerization to compare the relative contribution of the turnover to the total input power we define 11 simple stability analysis of a flat shell under uniform active stress shows that the thickness is stable if 4 kd if the additional tension generated by turnover 2 t a kd vp t is neglected the threshold for stability doubles to 8 kd which shows that the turnover stress has a

rocha et al preprint submitted to elsevier page 25 of 37 shell theory of the cell cortex 10 discussion the lack of generic and flexible theoretical and numerical frameworks to realistically simulate the 3 d shape changes of single or multiple interacting cells has been limiting our ability to characterize complex morphogenetic events such as asymmetric cell divisions 108 109 110 111 112 and rapid multicellular reorganizations 113 114 115 which are fundamental to early embryogenesis and tissue morphogenesis to fill this gap we derived in this paper a viscous active thin shell theory for the cell cortex in general curvilinear coordinates andwe proposed a numerical implementationwith the finite element library fenics 84 51 which we hope will facilitate the spread reuse modification and refinement of our model we have used systematic asymptotic expansions to derive leading order constitutive equations governing the dynamics of the actomyosin cortex the main geometrical assumption is the slenderness of the cortex meaning that the characteristic thickness t 0 must be small relative to a characteristic size of the cell typically its curvature radius our main physical assumption is to describe the actomyosin cortex as a continuous medium relying on hydrodynamics active gel models 11 9 here we chose to model the actomyosin material as a single incompressible active fluid phase following previous approaches 12 7 however the full rheological and dynamic complexity of actomyosin networks may not be fully encompassed by such a simple constitutive equation the asymptotic expansion approach may provide a generic and rigorous method to derive alternative thin shell models based on refined descriptions of actomyosin rheology a first extension would be to account explicitly for the dynamics of the nematic order of filaments active nematic gel theories 9 12 provide a convenient framework to describe the bidirectional coupling between nematic order and surface flows our derivation was done with a generic active tensor q it was then supposed nematic in the two examples to account for the approximate alignment of filaments parallel to the midsurface while we neglected dynamic filament reorganization in this tangent plane to obtain a proper nematic active thin viscous shell theory one should write explicitly a bulk dynamic equation forq and reduce it into an effective 2 dimensional equation defined on the midplane our theory may also be readily extended to account for possible transverse gradients in myosin 116 that could generate additional active torques we assumed that actomyosin is incompressible but this material may be better described as a permeating gel by introducing a local actin density 117 118 describing the cortex as a gel seems important to better assess the contribution of turnover to stress resultants which relies here importantly on the incompressibility condition by essence our model was designed as purely viscous and is well suited to describe shapes changes on timescales much larger than a typical actomyosin turnover time k 1 d but it couldalso be extended to describe the viscoelastic response of the cortex on shorter timescales 4 although this may entail the more difficult handling of power law rheological models 119 all these possible extensions rely generally on bulk descriptions of actomyosin mechanics that do not derive directly from microscopic descriptions of the network ample numerical and theoretical effort will also be required in the field to bridge these scales quantitatively our thin shell theory accounts for viscous stretching and bending resistance making it relevant to de scribe rapid curvature changes although viscous in nature the stokes rayleigh analogy allows for inter preting our model in terms of the classic theory of elastic shells and the equations we obtained may be classified into koiter like shell models in contrast to alternative direct active surface approaches 120 the derivation of a proper thin shell theory starting from three dimensional constitutive equations shows its relevance for the cortex through two important predictions first the balance between polymerization and depolymerization is predicted to create contractile or extensile tensions and may also oppose or promote the bending of the layer this effect depends inher ently on the shell character of the cortex and relies primarily on our hypothesis of an incompressible phase and on the fact that the cortex grows from the plasma membrane creating an inward addition of material that may translate into longitudinal viscous flows and hence into turnover generated viscous hudson borja da rocha et al preprint submitted to elsevier page 26 of 37 shell theory of the cell cortex stresses it follows that active cell deformations depend not only on the contractile activity of myosin motors but also on the speed of actin de polymerization which is particularly important to relate cell shape changes to its molecular regulation such contribution has been neglected in previous theo ries of active membranes 12 7 39 yet using experimentally measured parameters we find that up to 25 of the active power input may come from turnover during cytokinesis and that it largely contributes to the equatorial contractile force that divides the cell second a proper thin shell model with bending resistance is necessary to account for rapid changes in cell curvatures as one may observe in hyperosmotic shocks here the asymptotic approach allowed us to calculate prefactors for active bending terms 43 which would have been otherwise difficult to write down directly yet in the two numerical examples we chose we found that active bending was largely negligible from a numerical perspective we provided an easily modifiable python implementation of the model within the general purpose finite element library fenics we proposed a numerical scheme based on a penalization method that circumvents the need for c 1 elements to use more simple c 0 elements in the cortex gradients in contractile stress can lead to strong tangential motions and convergent flows which create excessive distortions of the computational mesh linked to the material 7 see fig 10 in the present work such significant distortions were circumvented through repeated remeshing of the computational mesh and interpolation of the fields this solution may prove costly for larger meshes and a more appropriate alternative using an arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale representation 121 may be used in which one is free to decouple the movement of the lagrangian particles from the movement of the mesh such an approach has been previously employed for the simulation of fluid membranes 39 122 and our description can be very easily translated into a similar ale formulation our finite element numerical scheme may be adapted in the future to tackle more complex morpho genetic processes in particular one can readily envision the study of the cell division when the cell is confined to a rigid shell as happens for instance in sea urchin or worm eggs such as c elegans where such confinement leads to two tightly apposed membranes in the furrowing region 123 during division and migration cortical flows have been long predicted to reorient actin filaments 103 60 61 which in turn may influence cortical contractility 97 99 interestingly rayleigh variational formulations for 2 d nematic sur faces are already available 90 but solving numerically for the coupled viscous nematic dynamics remains a challenging task 91 that may require specific finite element approximations to implement tensorial dynam ics on moving boundaries 124 125 another possible extension of our numerical approach is the coupling of cortical mechanics with regulatory proteins lying at the plasma membrane which may diffuse react and be advected by cortical flows to generate complex morphogenetic patterns 126 127 128 129 38 19 fi nally the generalization our model to multicellular systems by solving for instance similar equations on non manifold triangular meshes 8 would allow us to envision very realistic

numerical values have been chosen so that r 0 1 and ta 10 are the reference length and timescale c boundary conditions to apply the boundary conditions we need to define a set of basis vector tangent and normal to the outer surface the position vector in the outer surfaces is x x t 1 2 t t n t here we specified that the thickness t is a function of time and varies along the sheet moreover indicates that the variable in question is evaluated at z t 2 then the covariant and contravariant tangent vectors to the outer surfaces are c x g 1 2 t g 3 c g g t 2 2 g 3 1 2 t g 101 where 1 14 g t t 1 2 the outward unit normal vectors are c 3 c 3 n n i gi with n 1 1 2 t and n 3 1 the main driver of cortex deformation is generally the local motor activity which creates additional internal contractile stress akin to a negative pressure in the layer that cells can control longitudinally however external normal forces are also present in the form of hydrostatic pressure stemming from the extracellular or intracellular medium or cytoplasm tangential external loads may also exist at the inner and outer surfaces of the cortex such as friction forces arising from the interactionwith the plasmamembrane or viscous resistance from the cytoplasm then let p p i ci p i c i represent the stress vector applied to the outer surfaces of the cell per unit area of those outer surfaces the vectors ci and c i are the given by 101 the tangential components of the applied stress are p or p and the the normal components p 3 or p 3 continuity of the stress vector at the outer surfaces

the thin shell limit of the shearable model in this section we show how to retrieve eq 24 and 25 from their shearable counterparts eq 60 and 61 in the thin shell limit where shear is negligible lets

use of the gauss weingarten and codazzi b b relations will lead to eq 25 hudson borja da rocha et al preprint submitted to elsevier page 37 of 37
