fiber composites in the form of kevlar yarn with a thin outer layer of graphene was investigated and modeled such fiber structure may be fabricated by using a strong chemical bond between kevlar yarn and graphene sheets chemical functionalization of graphene and kevlar may achieved by modification of appropriate surface bound functional e g carboxylic acid groups on their surfaces in this report we studied elastic response to unidirectional in plane applied load with load peaks along the diameter the 2 d linear elasticity model predicts that significant strengthening occurs when graphene outer layer radius is about 4 of kevlar yarn radius the polymer chains of kevlar are linked into locally planar structure by hydrogen bonds across the chains with transversal strength considerably weaker than longitudinal one this suggests that introducing outer enveloping layer of graphene linked to polymer chains by strong chemical bonds may significantly strengthen kevlar fiber with respect

composites 2 1 introduction reinforced polymer fibers have been studied intensively in search of superior fabrics for a broad range of applications including bullet proof vests protective clothing and high performance composites for aircraft and automotive industries 1 2 for most structural materials the compressive strength is much greater than the tensile strength fiber reinforced composites are among a few materials that exhibit greater tensile strength than compressive strength this behavior results from fiber micro buckling compressive failure mechanism in fiber composites static compressive strengths of unidirectional composites have been studied by several research groups in the past few decades 3 6 a major step forward in the protection of personnel against ballistic threats has been achieved by introduction of kevlar synthetic fibers and textiles the most common approaches for the fabrication of reinforced composite fibers have been melt processing and solution coagulation spinning 7 8 kevlar fibers are produced by wet spinning from sulfuric acid solutions 9 while in acid solution kevlar form liquid crystalline phase with rod like polymer chains well aligned parallel to each other and bonded by hydrogen bonds across to form strong planar sheets 10 such sheets are stacked radially to form kevlar fiber as a result the fiber is much stronger with respect to longitudinal deformations than to transversal deformations on the other hand the carbon nanotubes cn and graphene sheets gs have been proposed as one of the most promising additives for the fabrication of ultra strong polymer composites due to their advanced mechanical properties 11 12 it is well known that carbon nanotubes and graphene sheets have young s modulus and tensile strength above 1 tpa and 60 gpa 13 16 respectively while their densities can be as low as 1 3 g cm 3 they may exist as single layered or multi layer structures it is possible to harness the multifunctional properties of graphene sheets and design novel class of advanced composites with superior mechanical and electric performance 17 18 thus various polymeric cn and polymeric gs composites and their chemical functionalisations have become a subject of intensive research and technological development over the last years 19 20 recently a significant mechanical enhancement of kevlar fibers has been demonstrated by incorporation of surface modified carbon nanotubes achieved by using n methylpyrrolidone nmp solvent 21 22 the maximum values observed were for young s modulus 115 207 gpa yield strength 4 7 5 9 gpa strain at break 4 0 5 4 and toughness 63 99 j g 21 in this paper we present the 2 d linear elasticity model to predict the mechanical properties of the kevlar fibers reinforced by depositing an outer shell of graphene rigidly simulation of the elastic properties of reinforced kevlar graphene composites 3 attached to kevlar fiber by chemical bonding the schematic diagram of the kevlar graphene fibers is shown in figure 1 a graphene outer layer can be formed by soaking kevlar single fiber with graphene dispersed in n methylpyrrolidone nmp solvent by using spinning technique it will be possible to create a composite structure by depositing an outer layer of graphene enveloping the kevlar fiber this lead us to hypothesize that graphene could be incorporated into swelled kevlar fibers by soaking fibers in a dispersion of graphene in nmp chemical functionalization of graphene and kevlar may be achieved by modification of appropriate surface bound functional e g carboxylic acid groups on their surfaces we anticipate that outer graphene layer enveloping kevlar fiber may stabilize radially stacked hydrogen bonded planar sheets forming kevlar fiber with respect to transversal deformations the main goal of this paper is to model the mechanical behavior of kevlar graphene fibers and to predict the optimal thickness of the outer layer of graphene for strengthening we show that within 2 d linear elasticity model and taking realistic young modulus and poisson ratios for transversal deformations reinforcement starts to occur when the outer hard shell radius is about 4 of kevlar fiber radius corresponding to about 8 weight we assume that applied load has a narrow load peak along the diameter which we may take to be the y axes typical displacements are shown in figure 1 b our modeling assumes that graphene flakes are tied up together by covalent bonds which may be achieved by graphene functionalization in the presence of strong interlayer covalent bonds we assume that bonded graphene flakes will have high young modulus and tensile strength in all directions and we model it by isotropic continuous model such model predicts theoretical limit on strengthening which may be achieved commercially available kevlar fiber has radius of about 6 microns in that case we will need about 240 nanometers of functionalized multilayer graphene for substantial two fold yield strength improvement at such scale continuous elasticity model may be used 2 explicit solution we assume that the enveloping graphene layer and kevlar fiber are rigidly attached by chemical bonds on their common boundary and that the load is perpendicular to the fibers in this section we derive an explicit solution of planar linear elasticity equations modeling a circular fiber enveloped by a rigidly attached to it ring of different stronger material simulation of the elastic properties of reinforced kevlar graphene composites 4 in section 3 we use our explicit solution to compute stress tensor both in the outer graphene layer and inside kevlar fiber and to analyze increase of the yield strength of the composite system as a function of reinforcing layer thickness our explicit solution is given in terms of the airy stress function u airy stress function is a function from which the stress and strain tensors can be derived at any given point x y those stress and strain tensors will then automatically satisfy the equilibrium equations of linear elasticity airy stress function is a solution of bi harmonic equation 2 u 0 1 it is related to the stress tensor by yy 2 u x 2 xx 2 u y 2 xy 2 u x y 2 it is well known 23 that a biharmonic function can be expressed via two analytic functions z z z x iy 2 u z z 3 it follows from 2 that xx yy 2 yy xx

that a 0 a 0 21 this is the condition for 17 20 with n 0 to have solution in fact solution for n 0 mode is not unique however it is clear from 5 that imaginary part of a 0 does not affect the stresses thus we can take a 0 a 0 22 assuming zero total force a 1 0 23 with this condition and using 14 equations 17 18 are consistent for n 1 mode and similarly equations 19 20 are consistent for n 1 solving

reinforced kevlar graphene composites 7 coefficients pn can be found from 12 24 pn a 2 n 1 n a 2 n a 2 n n z 25 we note that it is evident from the above formulas as well as from dimensional analysis that for a prescribed applied external stress given as a function of the polar angle the solution for stresses on the domain depends on the ratio of internal and external radii r 1 r 1 r 2 but not the overall scale r 2 3 analyzing solution for a given load we can compute components of stress tensor using equations 5 9 10 14 24 25 those formulas determine stresses created by any transversal load in this paper we will analyze in detail response to uni directional transversal compression applied along a diameter such load may be used to estimate a response to the transversal compression of a fiber created by impacting projectile when the fiber is pressed against a matrix and other fibers to stay in place we assume that in such case high loads will be applied in a small neighborhood of points of contact and will be uni directional young modulus of the reinforcing outer graphene layer is very high thus we anticipate that material delivering external load e g a projectile and the matrix or loading plate in a static loading experiment will be deformed at a point of contact with the reinforced fiber to estimate stresses in the kevlar graphene system we assume that the load is uniform in a small region of contact the load we use in our study is shown in figure 2 compressing force is applied on the outer boundary in the y direction in a small neighborhood of y axes intercept with an opposite balancing force applied in diametrically opposite region magnitude of the force per transversal to y surface area element as a function of the polar angle has narrow peaks centered at 2 we take the magnitude to be constant 1 gpa at such peaks and we take width of the peak to be w 16 outside of the peaks we take a smooth interpolation to a zero value in a small angular region of width thus fy the y axes projection of the applied force per transversal to y area element as a function of polar angle is given by fy 1 2 w 2 1 2 w 2 0 2 w 26 simulation of the elastic properties of reinforced kevlar graphene composites 8 corresponding stresses applied on the outer boundary as functions of polar angle are rr fy sin sin r fy sin cos 27 fy as a function of the polar angle is shown in figure 2 a in figure 2 b and 2 c we plot components of the stress tensor rr and r induced in the material by such applied load as a function of the polar angle here r are polar coordinates stress rr corresponds to a compression in the vicinity of two diametrically opposite points on the y axes stress r rapidly changes sign at those points this is because projection of fy onto the polar unit vector e changes sign to understand how stresses are distributed in the kevlar fiber and the outer graphene layer we compute components of the stress tensor using equations 5 9 10 14 24 25 we take experimental values for the transverse young modulus e 1 5 gpa and poisson ratio 1 0 35 for kevlar and e 2 600 gpa and poisson ratio 2 0 1 for the graphene in our analysis and we use the relationship 8 to estimate the lame parameters and of kevlar and graphene for the particular combination of lame parameters which appear in the exact solution 24 we get 1 1 85 gpa 1 1 6 for the kevlar 2 270 gpa 2 2 6 for the graphene we note that using the five elastic constants describing anisotropic transversally isotropic material when those constants are known will give more accurate determination of the transversal lame parameters those five elastic constants were measured for the kevlar km 2 fiber 25 using those we get values of the same order as above for 1 and 1 and the qualitative behavior of the solution is similar in figure 3 we plot the yy component of the stress tensor on the y axes that is on the line where the load is applied for varying values of the ratio of the inner to outer radius r 1 r 1 r 2 we clearly see that the stress in the kevlar fiber region is considerably reduced dropping down in the stronger graphene region with about 2 fold drop when r 1 0 96 and even bigger drop for smaller r 1 the magnitude of the drop varies continuously when we vary r 1 when r 1 approaches 1 there is no reduction of stress as expected in figure 4 we plot all 3 components of the stress tensor in the kevlar fiber region for varying thickness of the outer graphene shell when graphene shell is thin e g r 1 r 1 r 2 0 99 there is not much reduction in stresses in kevlar but for a thicker outer shell r 1 0 96 there is about 2 fold reduction of stresses in the kevlar fiber region we see that stresses in the kevlar fiber region attain a maximum value in the outmost region of the fiber and near the y axes where the load is applied stresses in kevlar fiber simulation of the elastic properties of reinforced kevlar graphene composites 9 region vary continuously with the change of r 1 getting smaller when the outer graphene shell gets thicker in a continuous manner as expected in figure 5 we plot the rr and r components of the stress tensor in the kevlar fiber region corresponing to polar coordinates r those two components of stress tensor are selected since those are continuous across the inner boundary between kevlar and graphene regions behavior of those components in the kevlar fiber region is similar to the stress components in the euclidean coordinates x y shown in figure 4 stresses are larger in the outer parts of the fiber and near the y axes where the external load is applied for a fixed external load stresses decrease continuously with decrease of r 1 r 1 r 2 with approximately 2 fold decrease at r 1 0 96 3 1 estimating yield yield criteria for a broad class of materials may be given in terms of the von mises stress the von mises stress is proportional to the square root of the sum of squares of characteristic values of the trace free part of the stress tensor since kevlar fiber is transversally isotropic and the transversal yield strength of the kevlar fiber is much lower than the longitudinal one we will use a 2 dimensional version of the von mises stress m xx yy 2 4 2 xy 28 we note that for a planar elasticity problem we consider the longitudinal stress zz c 13 2 xx yy 0 6 xx yy and so is of the same order as planar stresses while longitudinal yield is much higher than the transversal yield thus using more accurate for anisotropic material yield criteria such as hill yield criteria will produce similar conclusions to illustrate how the von mises stress is distributed on the kevlar graphene domain we plotted the von mises stress 28 on the whole domain figure 6 a and on the kevlar fiber region figure 6 b in the case when r 1 r 1 r 2 0 95 the external applied load is along the y axes and has a sharp peak of polar angle width 16 as in 26 27 distribution of the von mises stress is largely similar to the distribution of components of the stress tensor in figure 4 there is a sharp drop of the von mises stress occuring in the stronger outer graphene layer with a more than 2 fold decrease of stress in the kevlar fiber compared to the case of no graphene reinforcement on the kevlar fiber domain the von mises stress is larger in the outmost region and near the y axes where the external stress is applied simulation of the elastic properties of reinforced kevlar graphene composites 10 von mises yield criteria is that yield occurs when max the maximum value of the von mises stress m taken over the domain becomes greater or equal to the critical value yield specific for the material for kevlar yield 2 9 gpa for longitudinal loads 10 but for transversal loads it is lower e g for kevlar pekk composite the transversal strength is 21 mpa 24 if at a fixed external load the maximum von mises stress in the kevlar region is reduced by a factor of 2 say due to reinforced outer graphene layer that implies that combined kevlar graphene system will have twice bigger yield strength we assume as experimental data suggests that the yield strength of graphene is much bigger than the transversal yield strength of kevlar and that linear elasticity approximation suffices for the estimate in figure 7 we show the reduction of the maximum value of the von mises stress in the kevlar fiber region as a function of the ratio of the kevlar fiber radius r 1 to the total radius r 2 for various loading cases figure 7 a shows a uni axial compression in the y direction applied to the outer graphene layer and having a sharp peak of angular width 16 on the y axes figure 7 a illustrates typical displacements for such load in figure 7 d we show the reduction of the maximum von mises stress in the kevlar fiber region max r 2 max r 1 as a function of the inner to outer radius ratio r 1 r 2 figure 7 b shows an off center compression in the y direction applied to the outer graphene layer at 4 points having polar angles 4 3 4 each load has angular width 16 figure 7 c shows a one sided version of such off center compression applied at 2 points having polar angles 4 in figures 7 b c we illustrate typical displacements for such loads reduction of the maximum von mises stress for such loads is shown in figures 7 e and 7 f respectively the calculation reveals that the reduction of the maximum von mises stress for all the three different loading cases was similar conclusions strengthening of kevlar graphene fibers with the increase of thickness of the outer layer of graphene was predicted by analyzing an explicit solution of the equations of 2 d linear elasticity results of computation of von mises stress in kevlar graphene fibers for different transversal loadings demonstrated a two fold increase in the yield strength when the outer graphene shell radius was about 4 corresponding to about 8 weight of the simulation of the elastic properties of reinforced kevlar graphene composites 11 kevlar fiber radius the
