abstract we report that both shear and bulk moduli not only shear modulus are critical parameters involved in both homogeneous and inhomogeneous flows in metallic glass the flow activation energy f of various glasses when scaled with average molar volume vm which is defined as flow activation energy density f vm can be expressed as 11 10 kg e the extended elastic model is suggestive for

the mysterious glass transition phenomenon which connects the liquid and glassy state has wide applications in daily life industry and organism preservation 1 4 in the past decades intensive efforts have been made to understand the glass transition 1 5 9 to understand the flow in supercooled liquid and glass many models have been proposed the well known models are the free volume model the adam gibbs entropy model the mode coupling theory and elastic models 1 6 a successful model of viscous liquids and glasses must explain why the activation energy has such strong temperature dependence and can correlate the activation energy to simple and readily measurable parameter among these models the elastic models link the glass transition and elastic moduli of the glasses 1 all the elastic models link the activation energy to the readily measurable instantaneous shear modulus g in metallic glasses the glass transition temperature tg indeed shows clear correlation with the elastic moduli such as young s modulus e and g 10 18 in this letter based on the scaling laws between tg and elastic moduli in metallic glasses we demonstrate that the vm scaled flow activation energy f that is flow activation energy density f vm is determined by both g and k in a way of 10 g k 11 the physical origin of the extended elastic model is discussed the temperature dependence of the viscosity of liquids approaching glass transition is 1 tk tf b exp 0 where 0 is a constant kb is the plank constant at tg the viscosity of various liquids get to tg 1013 poise 3 for metallic glasses then the f tg should be the same for metallic glasses a variety of elastic models have been proposed 1 which assume that f is proportional to the elastic modulus 1 e g f g figure 1 a shows experimental data of e and g versus tg for 46 different kinds of bulk metallic glasses bmgs listed in table i these bmgs cover many typical alloy systems including zr cu ca mg ni fe and rare earth elements based bmgs and their thermal mechanical and physical properties are markedly 3 different their values of tg e and poisson s ratio span from 317 k to 930 k 23 gpa to 195 gpa 0 276 to 0 41 respectively 12 13 the linear fitting results are e 0 206 0 017 tg and g 0 0759 0 0065 tg the relations between tg and g and e are key evidence for the elastic model 1 however it can be seen that the data are rather scattered and the adjusted r square the adjusted coefficients of determination 19 are 0 755 and 0 741 respectively which denotes that g or k should not be the only parameter that involved in glass transition in fact according to shoving model a characteristic volume vc is involved in homogeneous flow of glass forming liquids as 1 14 f gvc in inhomogeneous flow of glasses the activation energy of a flow event unit shear transformation zone stz also correlates with volume as 15 16 22 8 cgf where is the volume of stz and c is the shear strain limit recently it is found that the elastic moduli scaled with vm show better correlations with the thermal and mechanical properties for metallic glasses 17 18 20 21 thus the characteristic volume could be an important parameter involved in the flow event in glass transition and glass figure 1 b shows the plot of gvm and evm versus tg for these bmgs indeed the data can be better fitted with evm 1 53 0 06 tg and gvm 0 560 0 029 tg and the adjusted r increases to 0 923 and 0 905 respectively the results certify that the combination of g and vm e and vm does show much better correlation with tg and the vm is another important parameter in governing the glass transition it is found that the atom number n involved in the cooperative flow events of stz in metallic glasses is similar and around 100 15 16 and the volume of stz can be expressed as 100 1 n i a m i n v nvv where na is the avogadro constant the inhomogeneous flow in glass is a self organized of a large number of local shearing events or stz 15 17 and the transition from local shearing to macroscopic shear band results from the dramatic increase of the atom mobility and softening along a shear plane 4 motivated by the input mechanical energy 15 17 thus the transition is akin to a process of stress driven glass to liquid transition or glass transition 17 then the involved activation energy gv ngvm na should have linear correlation with kbtg the good linear correlation between gvm and evm and tg in fig 1 b confirms that the n involved in the cooperative flow event for various metallic glasses is almost the same based on above scaling laws and elastic model we propose that it is the flow activation energy density e not the flow activation energy itself correlates with the elastic moduli as e mv f moduli 1 the extended elastic model means that the energy per volume needed in glass transition or in stz in metallic glass is proportional to the elastic moduli previous elastic models 1 suggest that the atoms or atomic groups go through pure shearing displacement which is independent of k and the e depends only on g recent works 18 20 and the jamming model of granular systems 22 find that both shear and dilatation are involved in the flow during glass transition and deformation next we further justify the flow activation energy density e relates not to g or k but both g or k that is the flow event relate to both shearing transformation corresponding to volume preserving g and dilatation corresponding to volume nonpreserving k at tg the f tg should be the same for all glasses that is independent of poisson s ratio or other moduli 3 however the statistics analysis of both gvm tg and kvm tg for glasses listed in table i show linearly depends on as kvm tg 8 78 and gvm tg 0 86 respectively fig 2 a b the relationships between f tg and should be neither the dashed black line kvm tg nor the short dashed olive line gvm tg but a constant like the solid magenta line in fig 3 a the slope in the relationship of kvm tg vs is positive while that of gvm tg vs is negative the bigger the slope of kvm tg vs or gvm tg vs is the less the contribution to f of the modulus should be this 5 indicates that if f tg would be a constant it should not only relate to g or k but a combination of both k and g when the ratio of the contribution of g and k is about 8 78 0 86 10 1 or alternatively e f vm 10 g k 11 the f tg vs is a constant as shown in fig 3 a figure 3 b shows the results of 0 91 g 0 09 k vm tg vs for various bmgs the data indeed can be well fitted by a constant of 0 63 and is independent of which is consistent with the glass transition phenomenon that the viscosity of all the liquids gets to the same value at tg the f 0 91 g 0 09 k vm which is independent of mass or amount is a kind of elastic energy and the ratio f rtg 0 63 r 0 076 which is dimensionless can be regarded as some kind of elastic strain stored in glassy state 23 thus the glass transition could be regarded as the release or absorb of the elastic strain stored the acoustic velocities behaviors during glass transition further verify the extended elastic model the t dependent transversal vs and longitudinal vl velocities change differently during the glass transition process 1 24 25 and the ratio of their relative changes is about 1 2 l l s s v v v v from gvs 2 and kgvl 3 4 2 we obtain the relative changes of g and k in metallic glasses is 1 5 k k g g in 3 d space there are two shear models corresponding to g and one radial model dilatation model corresponding to k when atoms move thus the contribution of g should be doubled and the ratio of the contribution of g and k in e should be about 10 1 that is e 10 g k 11 we further discuss why the elastic moduli show better correlation with e rather than the activation energy itself the shear elastic energy density of a stz can be expressed as 4 sin 20 c 15 where 0 is the total barrier energy density and is the shear strain the g can be reduced from the not the shear elastic energy in a way of 0 g 22 0 8 c 15 this indicates that g is related to the barrier 6 energy density the k can be expressed as 0 0 2 00 2 2 2 0 vv vv v v v u v u vk 21 where u is the atomic potential energy v 0 is the atomic equilibrium volume u v 0 is the energy density and v v 0 correlates with elastic strain in harmonic approximation around v 0 the u can be expressed in a parabolic form as u u 0 1 v v 0 2 1 where is constant depending on the atomic bonding nature this gives k 2 2 u 0 v 0 which correlates with the potential energy density at equilibrium state thus both g and k are proportional to their corresponding deformation energy density therefore it is reasonable for e rather than the activation energy shows correlation with the combination of k and g most models for flow in glasses and supercooled liquids consider the case of simple shear which involves only shear stress and shear modulus our model suggests that the both homogeneous and inhomogeneous flows at one hand is shearing process and on the other hand must generate free volume which is a form of dilatation in fact the shear induced dilatation has been widely observed 22 and demonstrates that both shear and free volume are important for flow in glass transition and deformation and provides an intuitional picture of the flow of the atoms or atomic groups in glass or liquid furthermore the formation of shear bands when the bmgs deform plastically is thought to be akin to the process of glass transition 17 23 thus this means that both the shear 26 and the dilatation 22 could be involved in the formation of shear bands however due to the critical difference between the two phenomena the glass transition is constraint free while the formation of shear bands is stress constraint and the formation of shear bands then may involve less dilatation acknowledgements the experimental assistance of dq zhao and rj wang is appreciated financial support is from the nsfc nrs 50731008 and 50921091 and most 973 no 2007 cb
