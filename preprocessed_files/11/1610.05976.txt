private bag x 1 matieland 7602 south africa djbasson sun ac za keywords drinfeld modular forms product expansion drinfeld discriminant function abstract we give a product expansion for the drinfeld discriminant function in arbitrary rank r which generalizes the formula obtained by gekeler for the rank 2 drinfeld discriminant function this enables one to compute the fourier expansion of this function much more efficiently the formula in this article uses an r 1 dimensional parameter and as such provides a nice counterpoint to the formula previously obtained by hamahata which is written in terms of several 1 dimensional parameters 1 introduction one of the first great theorems in the theory of elliptic modular forms is the jacobi product formula for the discriminant function 2 i 12 q n 1 1 qn 24 where q e 2 i after drinfeld introduced elliptic modules 3 the study of a characteristic p version of modular forms called drinfeld modular forms took off beginning with david goss s thesis 8 it was not long before gekeler 4 proved a version of jacobi s product formula for drinfeld modular forms of rank 2 but the higher rank case had to wait for some new ideas to make a higher dimensional theory of modular forms possible this came in the form of pink s new compactification 12 of drinfeld moduli spaces with so called fine level structure which built on a construction of kapranov in a special case 11 a project initiated by breuer and pink and carried on by the author in his phd dissertation this work was supported by the wilhelm frank scholarship 1 http arxiv org abs 1610 05976 v 1 translated this idea into the rigid analytic setting 2 it is fitting that a generalization of the product formula see theorem 7 is one of the first results proved in the theory of higher rank drinfeld modular forms it should be noted that there exists a product formula for higher rank drinfeld discrim inant functions discovered by hamahata 9 and 10 it has a very different flavour from the formula proven in this note since it uses r parameters each depending on one variable while our formula uses one parameter that depends on r 1 variables generally speaking expansions of drinfeld modular forms are quite hard to compute this is true for rank 2 drinfeld modular forms as can be seen from 6 where even the simplest functions have complicated expansions and things only become worse in higher rank when coefficients are no longer constants but functions the product formula simpli fies the computation of expansions for higher rank drinfeld modular forms and is therefore not just an interesting result but a useful one as well 2 background and notation throughout this article a fq t and f fq t also let f fq 1 t be the comple tion at the infinite place for which f g qdeg f deg g and let c denote the completion of an algebraic closure of f the drinfeld period domain r is the complement of all the f hyperplanes in pr 1 c it inherits the structure of a rigid analytic space from p r 1 c since it is an admissible open subset 13 proposition 1 we shall need a more explicit description of this structure before the technical lemma 6 but this will be postponed until it is needed we shall write the elements in r as r 1 column vectors and normalize them so that the last entry of 1 2 r 1 r t is equal to where q 1 tq i 1 1 tq i t tq i 1 t is a generator for the lattice corresponding to the carlitz module this is only defined up to multiplication by an element in f q but we choose one and fix it by definition of r the elements 1 r are f linearly independent and in particular non zero there is an action of glr f on r given by j 1 where denotes the matrix product of the r r matrix with the r 1 matrix and j is a factor used to normalize so that its last entry is explicitly j is 1 times the last entry of if an fq subvector space l c has the property that its intersection with any ball of finite radius is finite then we can associate an exponential function el c c to 2 it under the convention that a primed sum or product indicates a sum or product over all non zero elements of a set it is defined as el x x l 1 x and is an entire surjective function with l as its set of roots it is also fq linear in the sense that el ax by ael x bel y for all x y c and a b fq it is easily verified that simultaneously scaling the lattice and the parameter x by a factor c c has the following effect ecl cx cel x if l is moreover an a module then there is the additional identity el ax l a el x where la is the polynomial 1 la z az a 1 l l 1 z el note that since el is l invariant the value of el does not depend on which represen tative in a 1 l is chosen each la can be thought of as an fq linear endomorphism of c and then the map l a endfq c defined by a 7 la actually defines a ring homomorphism we call this homomorphism the drinfeld module associated to l for proofs of these results and more about drinfeld modules see 7 any r gives rise to a lattice ar c and hence also to a drinfeld module which we denote instead of a r the leading coefficient of the polynomial t x depends on and in fact defines a rigid analytic function r c which is the function of interest in this note if we act with glr a on then the lattice ar maps to ar j 1 ar in particular t x tx t 1 1 x e 1 tx t 1 1 x j 1 e this equation shows that the leading coefficient changes according to the formula j qr 1 in other words is a weak modular form of weight qr 1 3 definition 1 let k be an integer a weak drinfeld modular form of rank r and weight k is a rigid analytic function f r c satisfying f j kf for all r and all glr a as in the classical and rank 2 cases weak modular forms also admit a fourier expansion write 2 3 r t for the element of r 1 obtained from by deleting its first component we introduce a parameter u 1 defined as u 1 ear 1 1 1 we shall often abbreviate u u 1 theorem 2 2 every weak modular form f has a laurent series expansion f n z fn u 1 n where each fn r 1 c is a holomorphic function moreover the fn are uniquely determined remark 3 the reader may be interested to know that the functions fn are themselves also weak drinfeld modular forms of rank r 1 and weight k n this fact is proven in 2 definition 4 let k be an integer a modular form f of rank r and weight k is a weak modular form of rank r and weight k whose u expansion has the property that fn is the zero function for all n 0 that concludes the background we need from 2 3 main result and proof from now on we denote the lattices ar and ar 1 by and respectively and assume that the drinfeld module is the one associated to suppose that the leading coefficient of the polynomial a x is a where the argument stresses the fact that this is a function depending on for each a a we define fa x x q r 1 deg a a 1 a x 1 1 it is a polynomial of degree q r 1 deg a 1 which is divisible by xq r 1 deg a q r 1 deg a 1 then 2 a u 1 1 uq r 1 deg a a 1 1 fa u 1 note for later use that 3 a t 1 q q deg a 1 4 which can be obtained by computing a x from t x in the proof of theorem 7 we suppress the subscript when we mean t the product in lemma 6 below is closely related to the product in the expansion of we need to deal with its convergence issues as some point so we start with it then we may do the various interchanges of summations and or products in the proof without worry lemma 6 asserts that the product converges uniformly on a certain set which we need to describe first since r is the complement of f hyperplanes in p r 1 c we wish to have a measure of how far an element r is from any hyperplane for this we follow the approach in 13 if h is a hyperplane defined over f it can be defined as the zero set of a linear equation with coefficients in f h x h 1 x 1 h 2 x 2 hrxr 0 this linear equation is only well defined up to scaling by a factor in c so we assume that max hj 1 then even though h might not be well defined h is well defined for any hyperplane h and any r we define i inf h h is a hyperplane defined over f if we also define maxrj 1 j then the sets rn r i q n for n n form a collection of affinoid subdomains of r remark 5 let b 0 r z c z r be the open ball with radius r in c the sets n 1 b 0 rn r 1 n where intuitively rn gets smaller as n increases play an important role in the analysis of higher rank drinfeld modular forms and are called quasi uniform neighbourhoods of 0 r 1 in 2 incidentally the set on which the u expansion of a drinfeld modular form converges is a quasi uniform neighbourhood punctured to exclude 0 r 1 if it is not holomorphic at infinity this at least gives some motivation as to why it occurs in the next lemma lemma 6 for any n n there exists an rn 0 such that the product a a 1 fa u converges uniformly for u b 0 rn r 1 n 5 proof by definition a x ax a 0 1 x and so 1 fa u 0 1 u in these products runs through the values e a 1 ar 1 we claim that these values are bounded from above by some d that is independent of a and r 1 n but may depend on n in the definition of e z z 1 z we can split the product into three factors those where z those where z and those where z the factors where z have absolute value 1 and the factors where z have absolute value less than or equal to 1 thus 4 e z 6 z z z each ar 1 is of the form a 1 1 ar 1 r 1 each ai a so i q n the first inequality follows since a 1 1 ar 1 r 1 is a f linear equation with largest coefficient greater or equal to 1 and the second follows from the definition of r 1 n it follows that each factor of 4 satisfies 6 6 qn since we may take 6 it remains to bound the number of factors since a 1 1 ar 1 r 1 and the smallest i is at least as large as q n times the largest j the ai are bounded by q n therefore the number of is bounded by q r 1 n which depends only on n that proves the claim now let si i 1 q q r 1 deg a be the symmetric polynomials in the set of for which a 0 so that fa u q r 1 deg a i 1 sq r 1 deg a iu q r 1 deg i since for each we have d depending only on n we have sj 6 dj for any 1 suppose that u d then sjuj 6 dj d j 6 j for each j q r 1 deg a i it follows that q r 1 deg a i 1 sq r 1 deg a iu q r 1 deg i 6 q r 1 deg a q r 1 deg a 1 as a this tends to 0 so the product converges uniformly on b 0 d r 1 n theorem 7 the u expansion of the drinfeld discriminant function is given by the product quq 1 a a 1 fa u qr 1 6 remark 8 if r 2 then we set 1 to be consistent with the product formula deter mined by gekeler the cautious reader may note that the factor of q 2 1 from gekeler s formula is missing this is a consequence of having normalized our elements r so that r instead of 1 corollary 9 if a denotes the set of monic polynomials in a then quq 1 a a 1 fa u qr 1 q 1 proof every polynomial can be uniquely written in the form cp with c f q and p a all that remains is to note that by definition fcp u fp u proof of theorem 7 the proof is very similar to gekeler s proof in the rank 2 case 4 so we give only the essential details during this proof let be the lattice 1 a ra and be the lattice 2 a ra the following formulae from 4 still hold 5 t t 1 a a r e 1 6 e x e x a a e x e a 1 e a 1 7 z c t z t z 0 x z t x z 0 where is the drinfeld module associated to the lattice and z 0 c is fixed they are equations 5 6 and 4 respectively in 4 from 5 we compute t t 1 a a r e 1 6 t t 1 a a r e 1 a a e a 1 e a 1 e t t 1 a a r e 1 a a t 1 a a r e a 1 e a 1 e 7 in the last product we note that adding the factor corresponding to 0 changes nothing since it is equal to e a 1 e a 1 1 thus t t 1 a a r e 1 a a t 1 a a r e a 1 e a 1 e first we compute the internal product in the second factor we break it up into two parts t 1 a a r e a 1 e a 1 qr a e 1 qr 2 a q r 1 fa u qr 8 and t 1 a a r e a 1 e 1 7 c t 1 a a t e a 1 e c 1 1 q c fq at c e 1 1 2 q c fq at c 1 fat c u 9 together 8 and 9 give a a e a 1 e a 1 e a a a q r 1 fa u qr q c fq at c 1 fat c u if deg a 1 we use 3 to obtain at c a q r 1 after which the previous equation simplifies to 10 a a e a 1 e a 1 e a a 1 fa u qr c fq 1 fat c u if deg a 0 it becomes instead 11 a fq 1 c fq 1 fat c u we now claim that a a deg a 1 1 fa u a a c fq 1 fat c u 8 indeed these products are of the same factors over the same index set so the result follows by uniform convergence of the products involved lemma 6 since fa u 0 when deg a 0 10 simplifies to 12 a a 1 fa u qr 1 lastly we compute t 1 a a r e again by breaking it into two parts let 1 where 1 t 1 a a and t 1 a a r 1 and distinguish the two cases where 1 0 and where 1 6 0 using 7 we get 1 t 1 a a t 1 a a r e 1 t 1 a a t e 1 1 1 q 1 c fq cu q 1 uq 1 13 the factor with 1 0 is 14 t 1 a a r 1 e putting together 12 13 and 14 we obtain the theorem remark 10 in this note we have restricted to the simplest case where a fq t and is the discriminant function that arises from the polynomial t x in 5 vii 4 gekeler extended this result to general drinfeld rings a where the discriminant function is the one associated to a x with a a the theory of higher rank drinfeld modular forms as developed in 2 allows for this generality and it is probably not hard to extend this result to the more general setting
