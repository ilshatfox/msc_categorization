combinatorial understanding of congruences for partition functions ehrhart theory allows us to give a new decomposition of partitions which in turn allows us to define statistics called supercranks that combinatorially witness every instance of divisibility of p n 3 by any prime m 1 mod 6 where p n 3 is the number of partitions of n into three parts a rearrangement of lattice points allows us to demonstrate with explicit bijections how to divide these sets of partitions into m equinumerous classes the behavior for primes m 1 mod 6 is also discussed 1 introduction ramanujan 18 observed and proved the following congruences for the ordinary partition function p 5 n 4 0 mod 5 p 7 n 5 0 mod 7 p 11 n 6 0 mod 11 in 1944 freeman dyson 9 called for direct proofs of ramanujan s congruences that would give concrete demonstrations of how the sets of partitions of 5 n 4 7 n 5 and 11 n 6 could be split into 5 7 and 11 equinumerous classes respectively felix breuer and brandt kronholm were

is unsatisfactory to receive no concrete idea of how the division is to be made we require a proof which will not appeal to generating functions but will demonstrate by cross examination of the partitions themselves 9 he conjectured that a very simple statistic on partitions the largest part minus the smallest part performs this division when considered modulo 5 and 7 he named this statistic the rank of a partition and he further hypothesized the existence of a different statistic called the crank that would witness ramanujan s congruence modulo 11 in the same way in 2 atkin and swinnerton dyer proved dyson s conjecture about the rank and in 1988 andrews and garvan 1 found a crank that not only witnessed ramanujan s congruence modulo 11 but also witnessed ramanujan s congruences modulo 5 and 7 with a new division into 5 and 7 classes respectively however in both cases the proofs were analytic and they did not employ a cross examination of the partitions themselves as dyson had hoped in 14 garvan kim and stanton finally gave a combinatorial proof of ra manujan s congruences by finding explicit bijections among equinumerous classes these bijections were realized by 5 7 and 11 cycles respectively that exhaust the corresponding sets of partitions their cycles led to new crank statistics that were different from the rank and the andrews garvan crank but that witnessed the congruence modulo 11 as dyson had requested and also witnessed the congruences modulo 5 and 7 with another new division into 5 and 7 classes respectively re markably more than 70 years after dyson s original request there is still no known bijective proof that the rank witnesses ramanujan s congruences modulo 5 and 7 in this paper we explore the possibilities for giving bijective proofs of partition congruences by considering p n 3 the number of partitions of n into three parts we define a new crank like statistic on partitions that has a remarkable property unlike the rank and the few known cranks for p n which witness congruences along certain arithmetic progressions we discover cranks for p n 3 that witnesses each and every instance of divisibility modulo a given prime we call cranks with this remarkable property supercranks and they were first treated by the second and third authors in 13 the new techniques we introduce here allow us to give the first infinite family of supercranks and more generally establish an entirely new framework for treating certain types of partition congruences and crank statistics although we currently restrict our attention to p n 3 in 5 we address a much more general class of partition functions our new method for discovering bijective proofs comes from an appeal to poly hedral geometry specifically ehrhart theory 3 4 10 11 12 partitions of an integer n into three parts can be viewed as integer vectors lying inside a triangle in 3 dimensional space we call this triangle the partition triangle and the natural inequalities that determine partitions with three parts define a polyhedral cone that we call the partition cone following ehrhart the partition cone can be tiled by in teger translates of a certain fundamental parallelepiped this tiling of the partition cone then induces a tiling of the partition triangle with slices of the fundamen tal parallelepiped figures 2 3 and 4 this construction allows us to decompose each such partition into a partition in the fundamental parallelepiped and a non negative integer vector that determines which translate of the fundamental 2 parallelepiped lies in we call the box remainder and the box quotient which together give the box decomposition of figure 5 and definition 4 1 the box decomposition has a purely combinatorial description that we study in detail in 5 in this paper we maintain a geometric vantage point whereby the box decompo sition allows us to view the set of all partitions of n into three parts as a union of six copies of triangular arrays tk of lattice points in particular as ehrhart al ready pointed out this provides a geometric interpretation of the coefficients of the quasipolynomial formula for p n 3 in a binomial basis with this geometric insight in hand when p n 3 exhibits divisibility it is often possible to reassemble the triangles tk into a rectangle of lattice points wherein the number of lattice points along the width or height of this rectangle is divisible by the modulus m we are interested in figure 6 cycling partitions along the rows of this rectangle provides a combinatorial witness for divisibility since this construction works for any arrangement of triangles tk into a suitable rectangle this method provides a whole family of combinatorial witnesses for congruences of p n 3 theorems 5 1 and 5 2 cranks for every such witness are given by a composition of the piecewise linear functions that perform the original decomposition into triangles tk and the subsequent rearrangement into a rectangle in general essentially the only way to write down a formula for these cranks is by this direct appeal to the mechanics of this rearrangement however for every prime m 1 mod 6 there is one special scheme for rearranging these triangles which causes all of the resulting cranks to simplify into a single simple formula the largest part minus the smallest part modulo m this simple statistic denoted cls witnesses each and every divisibility of p n 3 by any such m in other words the polyhedral geometry approach provides us with a deep structural insight into the set of partitions into three parts allowing us to construct a supercrank theorem 3 4 the rest of the paper is arranged as follows in section 2 we give background on formulas for p n 3 and fully characterize when p n 3 is divisible by any prime m 1 mod 6 in section 3 we define terms surrounding combinatorial proofs of partition congruences and we state our main theorem in section 4 we give our key decomposition of partitions into three parts via ehrhart theory in section 5 we use this decomposition to demonstrate a general method for constructing ehrhart cranks that witness congruences for p n 3 in section 6 we prove our main theorem based on the mathematics developed in the previous sections section 7 provides an alternate proof of the main theorem which in contrast to section 6 is confined to only the partition triangle in section 8 we use our techniques to consider the divisibility of p n 3 by primes m 1 mod 6 in section 9 we offer some concluding remarks and indicate some directions for future study 2 the arithmetic and congruence properties of p n 3 2 1 historical background for p n 3 historically there have been several ways to compute the values of p n 3 one method is the expansion of the generating function for p n 3 as rational function 3 n 0 p n 3 qn q 3 1 q 1 q 2 1 q 3 q 3 j 0 qj j 0 q 2 j j 0 q 3 j 1 however closed form formulas are far more convenient and attractive in the middle of the nineteenth century demorgan 7 8 proved that p n 3 was the nearest integer to n 2 12 2 and warburton 8 20 established p 6 k r 3 3 k 2 r 0 3 k 2 k r 1 3 k 2 2 k r 2 3 k 2 3 k 1 r 3 3 k 2 4 k 1 r 4 3 k 2 5 k 2 r 5 3 following the work of herschel 17 by the turn of the 20 th century even more methods for computing p n 3 had been developed by cayley 6 sylvester 19 glaisher 15 and others 8 16 for example p n 3 n 2 7 6 12 1 n 8 e 2 i n 3 e 4 i n 3 9 4 their efforts were not solely focused on p n 3 but on p n d in general as it applied to the theory of invariants each of 2 3 and 4 are considered quasipolyno mials for p n 3 unfortunately the above expressions for p n 3 have some shortcomings the methods used to obtain them either do not easily generalize or they require math ematics with a significant amount of depth moreover the expressions in 2 3 and 4 elicit very little information about the partitions themselves in the next section we consider an alternative that eradicates all of these shortcomings 2 2 ehrhart s method for computing quasipolynomials half a century ago the french geometer euge ne ehrhart devised a very elegant method for computing formulas for functions such as p n 3 p n d and many others 3 10 11 12 while ehrhart was interested in counting integer points in dilates of polytopes or in other words the number of solutions of a linear diophan tine system as a function of the system s right hand side his method boils down on the arithmetic level to straightforward manipulation of the relevant generating function the key insight is that it is useful to bring the denominator into the form 1 qj d for p n 3 we compute n 0 p n 3 qn q 3 1 q 1 q 2 1 q 3 q 3 1 q q 2 q 3 q 4 q 5 1 q 2 q 4 1 q 3 1 q 6 1 q 6 1 q 6 5 4 q 3 q 4 2 q 5 3 q 6 4 q 7 5 q 8 4 q 9 5 q 10 4 q 11 3 q 12 2 q 13 q 14 q 15 1 q 6 3 6 q 3 q 4 2 q 5 3 q 6 4 q 7 5 q 8 4 q 9 5 q 10 4 q 11 3 q 12 2 q 13 q 14 q 15 k 0 k 2 2 q 6 k 7 hence p 6 k 3 0 k 2 2 3 k 1 2 3 k 2 8 p 6 k 1 3 0 k 2 2 4 k 1 2 2 k 2 9 p 6 k 2 3 0 k 2 2 5 k 1 2 1 k 2 10 p 6 k 3 3 1 k 2 2 4 k 1 2 1 k 2 11 p 6 k 4 3 1 k 2 2 5 k 1 2 0 k 2 12 p 6 k 5 3 2 k 2 2 4 k 1 2 0 k 2 13 in this paper our focus is on the structure underlying lines 8 through 13 we will show that these expressions contain fundamental information about arithmetic geometric and combinatorial properties of the partitions themselves notice that 8 through 13 are given in the binomial basis which when simplified to the monomial basis are equivalent to the expressions in 3 in particular the formulas 8 through 13 as well as 2 3 and 4 show that p n 3 is a quasipolynomial as are all p n d for fixed d a quasipolynomial k is a polynomial in k whose coefficients are periodic functions of k equivalently a quasipolynomial is a function such that there exist polynomials 0 l 1 with the property lk r r k for all k 0 and r 0 l 1 the integer l is called a period of the minimal period of the partition function p n 3 is 6 as we have seen above in general the minimal period of p n d is lcm d lcm 1 d which is implicit in the work of herschel 17 cayley 6 sylvester 19 glaisher 15 and others 2 3 establishing infinite families of divisibility for p n 3 mod m with a quasipolynomial formula in hand it is straightforward to determine various divisibility properties of p n 3 for any prime m 1 mod 6 we can determine when m p n 3 completely proposition 2 1 let m 6 j 1 be prime then p n 3 0 mod m if and only if n 0 1 2 2 m 2 2 m 1 mod 6 m we will often write these congruences as for k 0 p 6 mk 0 1 2 2 m 2 2 m 1 3 0 mod m 14 proof write n 6 k r for 2 6 r 6 3 and appeal to 3 case 1 r 0 then m 3 k 2 m k i e 6 k n 0 mod 6 m 5 case 2 r 1 or 2 then m 3 k 2 rk m k i e n r mod 6 m or m 3 k r now m 3 k r k r 3 mod m and since m 6 j 1 the inverse of 3 is 2 j and so this is the same as k 2 jr mod m multiplying both sides of this congruence by 6 adding r and observing that 12 j 2 m 2 we have that this is equivalent to 6 k r n 12 rj r 2 mr r mod 6 m thus in case 2 we have p n 3 0 mod m n r mod 6 m or n 2 mr r mod 6 m i e exactly when n 1 2 2 m 1 4 m 2 1 2 2 m 2 2 m 1 mod 6 m case 3 r 3 observe that 3 k 2 3 k 1 3 k 1 2 2 1 4 also observe that modulo m 6 j 1 the inverse of 2 is 3 j and so the inverse of 4 is 9 j 2 thus m p 6 k 3 3 if and only if 3 k 2 3 k 1 3 k 1 2 2 1 4 3 k 3 j 2 3 j 2 0 mod m dividing by 3 this holds if and only if k 3 j 2 3 j 2 mod m which can only have solutions if 3 is a square modulo m since 1 m 1 m 1 2 and 3 m 1 b m 1 6 c we see that no matter what the parity of j is 3 is not a square modulo m 3 crank supercrank and statement of main theorem we saw in the last section that modulo any prime m 1 mod 6 the quasipoly nomial formula for p n 3 allows us to see exactly when m p n 3 a natural ques tion to ask is is there a combinatorial way we could have predicted this without appealing to the formula also are there crank statistics that witness any of this divisibility the remainder of this paper is devoted to demonstrating affirmative answers to both of these questions in this section we make rigorous the notions of combinatorial witness rank and crank we state our main theorem and we outline the proof definition 3 1 let s be a finite set of size n s and let m be a positive integer a combinatorial witness for m n is an explicit partition s s 0 t s 1 t t sm 1 of s into disjoint sets si together with explicit bijections i j si sj which witness that any two of the si are of the same size dyson s original request for a crank statistic has now been satisfied in a few different ways here we will refer to any statistic that forms a combinatorial witness for divisibility as a crank 6 definition 3 2 a crank is a function c s 0 m 1 defining the classes si c 1 i and cycles are given by a permutation s s such that si is a bijection between si and si 1 where the index i 1 is understood modulo m in this article we introduce a new class of cranks which we call ehrhart cranks in sections 4 and 5 below ehrhart cranks make excellent combinatorial witnesses as they reveal a tremendous amount of structure in sets of partitions with a restricted number of parts one remarkable crank is the following let p n 3 denote the set of partitions 1 2 3 with three parts 1 2 3 0 let a modulus m be fixed for every p n 3 define cls 1 3 mod m 15 to be the largest part minus the smallest part modulo m as we will show in section 6 cls defines a crank for all the congruences given in proposition 2 1 this is a particularly strong property for which we coin a new name supercrank definition 3 3 let m 1 be a fixed integer let s n be a finite set for every nonnegative integer n a function c defined on n z 0 s n is a supercrank if for all n z 0 such that m s n the function c is a crank witnessing this divisibility a main result of this paper is that cls has this property for the set of partitions into three parts for every prime m 1 mod 6 theorem 3 4 let m 6 j 1 be prime then cls largest part minus smallest part modulo m is a supercrank witnessing m p n 3 for each and every n z 0 for which this divisibility holds as characterized in proposition 2 1 we now give a rough outline of how theorem 3 4 will be established and we begin by describing a way in which one might geometrically demonstrate divisibility of p n 3 by m by treating a partition n 1 2 3 as an integer vector 1 2 3 z 3 we can see that the set of partitions of n into three parts is p n 3 1 2 3 z 3 1 2 3 n and 1 2 3 0 as can been seen in the example shown in figure 1 these lattice points fit into an obvious triangular region p n 3 which is determined by the above equation and inequalities applied in r 3 if we find a way to rearrange these points evenly into a rectangle such that the number of lattice points along the width or height of the rectangle is divisible by the modulus m we are interested in then we have a geometric demonstration that p n 3 is divisible by m see figure 6 for an illustra tion of course we would like to do this not for one particular n but if possible for every single n such that m p n 3 by studying these lattice points in a way outlined by ehrhart 3 10 11 12 a great deal of structure is revealed in section 4 in particular for every n this collection of lattice points dissects nicely into six neatly arranged triangular collections of points see figure 5 as it turns out for every prime m 1 mod 6 we are able to find a uniform method for arranging 7 these triangles into rectangles with side lengths divisible by m for every n such that m p n 3 and thus we have a geometric proof of the divisibility in fact the rectangles proving divisibility offer an obvious way to divide the par titions into cycles of length m we can define a crank statistic on the lattice points and equivalently on the partitions as simply the distance from the appropriate edge of the rectangle and then our partitions divide into m equal classes according to their crank modulo m as it turns out whenever we have one arrangement of our triangles into a useful rectangle we actually have many such arrangements for each we get a different crank statistic that witnesses the divisibility we call cranks of this type ehrhart cranks which are defined in section 5 in section 6 we find that among all of the possible arrangements of triangles into rectangles there is one that is by far the most well poised there is one way in particular of arranging the triangles such that a constant multiple of the distance modulo m from one edge of the rectangle is identically the largest part minus the smallest part of the partition in other words we have theorem 3 4 a statement as simple as dyson s original conjecture what is quite striking is that whereas dyson s rank witnesses the first two ramanujan congruences this new supercrank witnesses every congruence of the form p n 3 0 mod m for every prime m 1 mod 6 4 the box decomposition of restricted partitions in this section we introduce the box decomposition of a restricted partition into a box remainder which is a partition in the fundamental parallelepiped f 3 defined below and a box quotient which is a non negative integer vector this decom position is motivated by polyhedral geometry and is the result of applying a classic construction in ehrhart theory 3 10 11 12 in a partition theoretic context while this decomposition can be defined purely in combinatorial terms 5 the geometric point of view will provide the key intuition for the rest of this paper and so we introduce the relevant background from ehrhart theory in this section in partic ular we take great care to visualize the construction in order to build geometric intution to be clear our use here of the word box is not motivated by the geome try at hand but by the ferrers diagram of since partitions into three parts are the topic of this paper we will restrict our attention to the three dimensional case note however that the constructions below generalize in a straightforward manner to partitions with any fixed number of parts this is treated in detail in 5 for general introductions to ehrhart theory and polyhedral geometry we recommend the textbooks 3 and 21 we now set the stage for our definition of the box decomposition in definition 4 1 below as illutrated in figure 1 the starting point for the geometric approach is to view a partition n 1 2 3 as an integer vector 1 2 3 z 3 experienced partition theorists may not be used to this convention so just to be absolutely clear throughout the rest of the paper we will literally use the word partition to mean such a vector in z 3 the height 1 2 3 is the sum of coordinates of i e the number being partitioned the set of all partitions into three parts is then the set c 3 z 3 c 3 of integer vectors or lattice points in the 8 figure 1 the partition triangle p 18 3 and the set p 18 3 z 3 p 18 3 of partitions it contains the outer triangle is the intersection of the non negative octant with the constraint x 1 x 2 x 3 18 adding the inequality constraints x 1 x 2 shown in red x 2 x 3 green and x 3 0 dashed blue yields the half open partition triangle p 18 3 the lattice points p 18 3 are shown as black dots partition cone c 3 x r 3 x 1 x 2 x 3 0 16 the set of partitions of a fixed n into three parts is then the set p n 3 z 3 p n 3 of lattice points in the partition polytope or partition triangle p n 3 c 3 x r 3 x n 17 which is the intersection of the partition cone with the plane at height n with this notation the restricted partition function is simply p n 3 p n 3 one important property of the partition cone is that it has the dual description c 3 v 3 r 2 0 r 1 0 where v 3 6 3 20 3 2 0 0 2 18 the columns of v 3 are called the generators of the cone c 3 equation 18 states that c 3 is the set of all vectors that can be written as a linear combination of generators with non negative real coefficients where the coefficient of the last generator has to be strictly positive note that c 3 is simplicial i e the generators are linearly independent the generators are not uniquely determined we could replace any generator v by any positive multiple v for r 0 however the generators in 18 have the crucial property that they all have integer components and they are all at the same height notice 6 lcm 1 2 3 lcm 3 is the lowest height at which this happens the idea of choosing generators in this way goes back to ehrhart 10 11 12 as illustrated in figure 2 18 allows us to tile c 3 with integer translates of the fundamental parallelepiped f 3 via c 3 v 3 z 3 0 f 3 where f 3 v 3 0 1 2 0 1 1 19 9 a the fundamental parallelepiped f 3 of c 3 b translates of f 3 by any one of the generators and their intersection with p 21 3 c translates of f 3 by any two of the generators and their intersection with p 21 3 d translates of f 3 by any three of the generators and their intersection with p 21 3 figure 2 the fundamental parallelepiped f 3 tiles the cone c 3 which induces a tiling of p 21 3 with slices of f 3 at different heights here denotes the minkowski sum i e c 3 is obtained by translating f 3 by every vector v v 3 z 3 0 and then taking the union which is disjoint again we write f 3 z 3 f 3 note that the fundamental parallelepiped is not uniquely determined by the cone c 3 but by our particular choice of generators for every n the tiling 19 of c 3 induces a tiling of the partition triangle p n 3 as shown in figure 2 to make this precise we define hi f 3 r 3 i as the slice of f 3 at height i and let hi z 3 hi and h i hi denote the corresponding lattice point set and count respectively all slices h 0 through h 17 and the lattice points they contain are shown in figure 3 the coefficients in 8 through 13 reflect the lattice point counts in the hi we define tk v z 3 0 v k as the set of all non negative integer vectors with coordinate sum k the elements of tk are necessarily arranged in a triangle pattern and are correspondingly counted by the triangular numbers tk k 2 2 with this notation the construction shown in figure 2 then yields p 6 k r 3 hr v 3 tk h 6 r v 3 tk 1 h 12 r v 3 tk 2 20 p 6 k r 3 hr v 3 tk h 6 r v 3 tk 1 h 12 r v 3 tk 2 21 p 6 k r 3 h r k 2 2 h 6 r k 1 2 h 12 r k 2 22 for any r 0 5 and any k z 0 here we have made crucial use of the fact that our chosen generators are all at the same height and are integral in particular 21 shows that the coefficients h i count lattice points at a certain height in the 10 figure 3 the slices of the fundamental parallelepiped all the tiles hi and the lattice points they contain as we can see there are 36 distinct lattice points in f 3 the shapes of the lattice points indicate the last two coordinates any lattice point that is represented by a circle has last two coordinates 2 1 and 3 1 going one step right increases 2 by 1 going one step up increases 3 by 1 for example the circle in h 4 has coordinates 2 1 1 the circle in h 8 has coordinates 6 1 1 and the diamond in h 12 has coordinates 7 3 2 fundamental parallelepiped and that the binomial coefficients count translation vectors v tj this was ehrhart s key observation whence the vector h is called ehrhart h vector or ehrhart vector figure 4 shows examples of the tiling given in 20 for p 18 3 through p 23 3 passing from the continuous tiles to lattice point sets yields 21 counting these lattice points we obtain 22 which is the general form of equations 8 through 13 this construction shows that the coefficients of 22 hence 8 through 13 are precisely the lattice points counts in the hi as is evident in figure 3 since all unions are disjoint 21 allows us decompose any partition p n 3 uniquely into a partition the box remainder f 3 in the fundamental paral lelepiped and a partition of the form v 3 where z 3 0 the box quotient is a non negative integer vector for brevity we will simply say that we decompose into the pair this decomposition is vital for our results and so we summarize it in the following definition and lemma see figure 5 for an illustration definition 4 1 for all k z 0 r 0 5 and p 6 k r 3 write v 3 such that f 3 and z 3 0 23 11 a p 18 3 r 0 b p 19 3 r 1 c p 20 3 r 2 d p 21 3 r 3 e p 22 3 r 4 f p 23 3 r 5 figure 4 tilings of p 18 3 through p 23 3 define k r p 6 k r 3 hr tk h 6 r tk 1 h 12 r tk 2 qk r by 7 we abbreviate k r k r the pair is called the box decomposition of the partition f 3 is the box remainder and the vector is the box quotient of as we have proven above the crucial property of k r is the following lemma 4 2 for all k z 0 and r 0 5 the map k r p 6 k r 3 qk r is a bijection as 23 suggests we can think of the box decomposition as a division with remainder in addition to the example given in figure 5 consider the box decom position 11 5 2 2 2 2 v 3 1 1 0 even though 11 5 2 v 3 1 1 1 we have 1 1 0 since 2 2 2 f 3 but 0 0 0 6 f 3 the underlying reason is that we are working with partitions with exactly three parts in fact 2 2 2 is the magenta square in h 6 as shown in figure 3 the box decomposition has a very nice combinatorial interpretation in terms of a decomposition of the ferrers diagram of into boxes which is explored in 5 for the purposes of this paper our focus is on the geometric point of view 5 ehrhart cranks for witnessing divisibilities in this section we construct a whole family of combinatorial witnesses for each and every arithmetic progression of divisibility for p n 3 modulo any prime m 12 figure 5 the partition triangle p 20 3 is tiled with certain integer translates of h 2 h 8 h 14 in other words the set p 20 3 is decomposed into zero triangles t 3 as h 2 is empty 5 triangles t 2 one for each lattice point in h 8 and 1 triangle t 1 one for each lattice point in h 14 each partition in p 20 3 is decomposed into a fundamental partition and a non negative integer vector via v 3 for example 13 4 3 5 2 1 v 3 1 0 1 so that 3 2 with 5 2 1 and 1 0 1 1 mod 6 the basic strategy is the following the decomposition k r from definition 4 1 allows us to divide the set of partitions p 6 k r 3 into h r copies of the triangle tk h 6 r copies of the triangle tk 1 and h 12 r copies of the triangle tk 2 any way in which these triangles can be reassembled into a rectangle of lattice points wherein the number of lattice points along the width or height of the rectangle is divisible by m will provide us with cycles proving divisibility and a crank statistic that witnesses divisibility for that fixed r here it is crucial that for a given r there is an arrangement of triangles that works for all k so that we do indeed obtain a crank function that witnesses divisibility for the entire arithmetic progression with a fixed remainder we first give an informal statement of the theorem and then in theorem 5 2 we give the technical details theorem 5 1 for fixed r and m and any k 0 let r k be such that 6 mk r 6 k r then any way of reassembling h r triangles tk h r 6 triangles tk 1 and h r 12 triangles tk 2 into a rectangle r with one side divisible by m defines a crank function c as illustrated in figure 6 that witnesses the congruence p 6 mk r 3 0 mod m for all k 24 where cycles are given by traversing either the rows or columns of r 13 figure 6 the construction of an ehrhart crank c for the case r 2 m 2 the lattice point sets are shown for m 5 k 1 k mk m 2 3 6 however the rectangle arrangement given by is independent of these parameters to work our way up to a precise technical statement of this result let us consider the case of remainder r 2 m 2 as an example as shown in figure 6 our goal is to witness 24 to begin is given by the decomposition from section 4 to this end we rewrite 6 mk 2 m 2 6 mk m 2 3 2 and let k mk m 2 3 k 0 by 21 and 22 we have for all k k p 6 k 2 3 0 k 2 2 5 k 1 2 1 k 2 and p 6 k 2 3 h 2 v 3 tk h 8 v 3 tk 1 h 14 v 3 tk 2 where h 2 h 8 8 1 8 2 8 3 8 4 8 5 h 14 14 1 and 8 1 6 1 1 8 2 4 2 2 8 3 5 2 1 8 4 3 3 2 8 5 4 3 1 14 1 8 4 2 14 thus k 2 gives a bijection between p 6 k 2 3 and qk 2 for all k k in figure 6 the set qk 2 is visualized as 6 disjoint triangles as explained in section 4 we now show that the six interlacing triangles in p 6 k 2 3 h 2 v 3 tk h 8 v 3 tk 1 h 14 v 3 tk 2 can be rearranged to make a rectangle having at least one side of length a multiple of m this is done by noting that qk 2 being the six triangles indicated by the binomial coefficients in 5 mk m 2 3 1 2 1 mk m 2 3 2 can be arranged into a rectangle r k of width 1 k m 3 k 1 and height 2 k mk m 2 3 formally we let r 1 k 2 k 0 1 k 1 0 2 k 1 denote the continuous rectangle and write r k r 1 k 2 k z 2 r 1 k 2 k for the set of lattice points therein since in this example 1 k is a multiple of m for all k it follows that r k is divisible by m and this divisibility is witnessed by the crank r 2 0 m 1 x y 7 xmodm the cycles that go along with this crank are simply moving along a row of the rectangle our strategy will therefore be to reassemble the triangles in qk 2 to form the rectangle r k to this end assume that for every i 1 6 we have an affine linear function i r 3 r 2 such that for every s z 1 the restriction i ts is injective and 1 tk 1 2 tk 1 3 tk 1 4 tk 1 5 tk 1 6 tk 2 r k for all k k where the unions are disjoint and k is determined by k mk m 2 3 then the function qk r r k 7 is a bijection affine linear functions with this property can be understood by an inspection of figure 6 we will give explicit formulas for this example below but first let us reap the benefits of this construction the composition c k 2 p 6 mk r k 2 qk 2 r k 0 m 1 7 7 x y 7 xmodm is a crank function witnessing the congruence 24 for r 2 m 2 cycles are defined by moving along a row of r k one important aspect here is that the formulas for do not depend on k in this sense c is one function that witnesses divisibility for the entire congruence 24 for fixed r 2 m 2 the above construction generalizes which proves the following theorem theorem 5 2 let m z 1 and r z 0 be fixed let r 0 5 and k z z such that 6 mk r 6 k k r for all k z 0 let k k k k z 0 let 1 2 z z and r k r 1 k 2 k let h hr hr 6 hr 12 for each hr 6 i h let r 3 r 2 be an affine linear function such that

of theorem 5 2 for every r 0 1 2 2 m 2 2 m 1 for all k z 0 where the union is disjoint let qk k r r k be defined by let r 2 0 m 1 be a function of the form x y x y modm for z if at least one of the following two conditions hold i gcd m 1 and m 1 k for all k or ii gcd m 1 and m 2 k for all k then the composition c is a crank function witnessing the congruence p 6 mk r 3 0 mod m in case i let 10 in case ii let 0 1 cycles of length 1 k or 2 k respectively are then given by the operation 7 1 where the addition is taken modulo 1 k or 2 k respectively such rectangles r and triangle arrangements exist for all the cases covered in proposition 2 1 we call crank functions of the form c as given in theorem 5 2 ehrhart cranks lemma 5 3 for all r 0 1 2 2 m 2 2 m 1 there exist lengths 1 2 and affine linear functions satisfying the conditions of theorem 5 2 proof for every r the values of k r 1 2 and h r h r 6 h r 12 are given in ta ble 1 see also figure 3 we work with x y xmodm in the cases r 2 m 2 2 m 1 as here the width of r is divisible by m and with x y ymodm in the cases r 0 1 2 as here the height of r is divisible by m the triangle arrangements are given in figure 7 corollary 5 4 there exist ehrhart cranks with explicit cycles providing combina torial witnesses for the congruences of p n 3 as characterized by proposition 2 1 proof follows from theorem 5 2 and lemma 5 3 16 figure 7 the different triangle arrangements for every r 0 1 2 2 m 2 2 m 1 figure 7 gives a clear picture of how the maps are to be constructed for instructive purposes we work out an explicit formula for c as given in theorem 5 2 for the case r 2 m 2 below the triangle arrangement from figures 6 and 9 is given by the six affine linear 17 functions 6 1 1 0 1 00 0 1 4 2 2 1 1 00 1 1 10 5 2 1 0 1 00 0 1 1 1 10 0 0 20 3 3 2 1 1 00 1 1 1 1 10 0 0 30 4 3 1 0 1 00 0 1 2 2 20 0 0 40 8 4 2 1 1 00 1 1 2 2 20 0 0 51 exploiting the pattern evident in these formulas can be written more com pactly as 2 3 1 1 1 2 2 1 2 3 3 3 1 2 1 2 3 8 6 where is a vector encoding the multiplicities of the columns of the ferrers diagram of the fundamental partition i e 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 2 2 3 3 which in the case of the triangle arrangement we chose for r 2 m 2 gives 6 1 1 5 0 1 4 2 2 2 0 2 5 2 1 3 1 1 3 3 2 0 1 2 4 3 1 1 2 1 8 4 2 4 2 2 therefore the crank function c that witnesses p 6 mk 2 m 2 3 0 mod m is given by the formula c 2 3 1 1 1 2 2 k modm where and are the box remainder and box quotient as introduced in defini tion 4 1 from the division with remainder v 3 it is easy to derive explicit formulas for and expressed in terms of the floor and fractional part functions bxc and x in the case r 2 m 2 this leads to the following formula for the crank function c 2 3 2 3 2 2 3 2 z 1 1 6 1 3 2 3 2 k modm where k 1 2 3 1 6 2 3 3 2 3 2 z and f denotes the value 1 if the statement f is true and 0 otherwise 6 largest part minus smallest part is a supercrank in this section we use the methods developed in sections 4 and 5 to prove theo rem 3 4 which we restate here 18 figure 8 the cases r 0 1 2 all triangles are oriented as shown in the lower left of the figure the vertices of each triangle are labeled with their respective crank value modulo m the triangles are labeled by the corresponding vector in every column of every rectangle the crank value increases by 3 modulo m at every step wrapping around at the top which provides cycles witnessing divisibility along each row the crank value typically decreases by 3 but there are two jumps in each row this does not affect the cycles however theorem 3 4 let m 6 j 1 be prime then cls largest part minus smallest part modulo m is a supercrank witnessing m p n 3 for each and every n z 0 for which this divisibility holds as characterized in proposition 2 1 proof for all n characterized in proposition 2 1 we have to show that cls 1 3 modm witnesses m p n 3 i e c 1 ls 0 c 1 ls 1 c 1 ls m 1 25 to witness 25 combinatorially it suffices to find bijections fi c 1 ls i c 1 ls i 1 modm for all i 0 m 1 one way to construct these bijections is to find a single involution f p n 3 p n 3 with the property that cls f cls modm where is a constant relatively prime to m note that this property implies that on each cycle of the permutation f all crank values appear equally often for brevity we say that f cycles the crank values the construction of f is summarized in figures 8 and 9 we first decompose the relevant sets p n 3 into triangles tk as in section 4 then we reassemble these triangles into rectangles r k as in section 5 this time however we take additional care to make sure that values of cls change by a constant at each step along the columns cases r 0 1 2 shown in figure 8 or rows cases r 2 m 2 2 m 1 shown in figure 9 of the rectangles wrapping around at the boundary the permutation f that cycles the crank values is thus given by taking one step to the right or taking one step up in the rectangles given in figures 8 19 figure 9 the cases r 2 m 2 2 m 1 all triangles are oriented as shown in figure 8 the vertices of each triangle are labeled with their respective crank value modulo m the triangles are labeled by their corresponding box remainder in every row of every rectangle the crank value decreases by 3 modulo m at every step wrapping around at the right which provides cycles witnessing divisibility along each column the crank value increases by 3 modulo m without wrapping around at the top this is not relevant for the cycles however and 9 to make these ideas precise we now go into detail for the case r 2 m 2 the other cases are analogous let n 6 mk r for r 2 m 2 in this case k mk m 2 3 and r 2 given the decomposition k r p n 3 qk r defined in section 4 and the triangle arrangement given in figure 9 for this case we define f by f k r 1 k r 10 26 i e we get from to the next partition in the cycle by first finding the position of in the rectangle r k taking one step right in this rectangle and then making note of the corresponding partition moreover when we reach the right edge of the rectangle we wrap around and return to left edge of the rectangle in the same line more precisely the addition 10 in 26 is to be understood modulo m 3 k 1 in the first coordinate the function f is a permutation by construction moreover cls f cls 3 modm which we can see as follows first we observe that taking one step in any triangle tk changes the crank value as shown in figure 10 thus if triangles are oriented as shown in the bottom left of figure 8 then within each triangle the crank value will consistently change by 3 when taking one step right therefore all we have to ensure is that the triangle arrangement is such that the crank value also changes by 3 when stepping right from one triangle to the next and at the boundary to this end it is important to observe that for a fixed the crank values at the vertices l k 0 0 r 0 k 0 and t 0 0 k of tk are fixed constants modulo m that do not depend on k or m for example we can compute that for 20 figure 10 let l left r right t top denote the vertices k 0 0 0 k 0 0 0 k of tk respectively taking a single step from l to t changes the value of the crank c 1 3 by 6 modulo m i e c v 1 0 1 c v c v 1 0 1 6 modm and similarly for the other steps shown in the figure r 2 m 2 and 6 1 1 we have cls 1 k r l 5 mod m cls 1 k r r 0 mod m cls 1 k r t 5 mod m this data is recorded for all vertices of all triangles in figures 8 and 9 in the case r 2 m 2 we can see that moving horizontally from the triangle for 6 1 1 to the triangle for 4 2 2 the crank value changes by 3 as desired and similarly for all other steps to the right between different triangles in particular going from the rightmost edge of the rectangle to the leftmost edge the crank value also changes by 3 this completes the proof that f cycles the crank values and thus shows that cls is a supercrank for p n 3 above we have used the methods developed in sections 4 and 5 to prove that cls is a supercrank thus the question arises whether the crank cls is actually an ehrhart crank in the sense of theorem 5 2 i e whether cls c for the triangle arrangements given in the figures for the cases r 2 m 2 2 m 1 this is true immediately when choosing x y 3 x 3 y where is the value in the lower left corner of the respective rectangle however for the cases r 0 1 2 this does not work as the crank value cls does not increase linearly when moving to the right in each case there are two jumps when moving from one small sub rectangle to the next while this does not affect the above proof at all it means that no affine linear function can produce cls as an ehrhart crank however if we generalize the notion of an ehrhart crank to allow for functions that are piecewise linear then the crank cls is an ehrhart crank 7 a second proof of theorem 3 4 we provide an alternate proof of theorem 3 4 by cycling the partitions of p n 3 utilizing vector representations as in figure 1 the result is bijection from p n 3 back to itself 21 figure 11 there are three distinct m cycles for the case p 6 3 4 3 40 with m 5 k 1 and r 2 m 2 they are formed by 1 cycling the 20 partitions in the horizontal rows 2 3 and 5 of p 22 3 shown in red 2 cycling the 10 partitions in the horizontal rows 4 6 and 7 of p 22 3 shown in black and 3 cycling the 10 partitions in the horizontal row 1 of p 22 3 shown in blue the permutation on the rows defined by the bijection between the left and right boundaries is shown by the labels on the arrows at the sides see bullet r 2 m 2 in this section the crank values of the partitions are shown as subscripts on the partitions e g the partition 22 17 3 2 has crank value 0 22 alternative proof of theorem 3 4 let n be such thatm p n 3 by proposition 2 1 we may write n 6 mk r for some r 0 1 2 2 m 2 2 m 1 fol lowing the approach taken in section 6 we show that cls is a crank by constructing a permutation f on p n 3 with the property cls f cls 1 modm a partition p n 3 is on the left border b of the partition triangle if and only if 2 3 as illustrated in figure 11 we now define f as follows i for 2 6 3 f f 1 2 3 1 2 1 3 1 i e if is not on the left border of p n 3 the map f translates one unit to the left within p n 3 ii for 2 3 f is defined by case distinction on r see list below if is on the left border of p n 3 then f maps to the right border of p n 3 such that the value of cls increases by 1 it is now straightforward to check that f is injective and that cls f cls 1 modm for partition 6 b this is immediate and for b this follows from the list of case distinctions below thus f cycles the values of cls as in section 6 which proves that cls is a supercrank for p n 3 figure 11 provides an example of the three distinct m cycles for the case p 22 3 40 with m 5 k 1 and r 2 m 2 we note that a partition on the left border b of p n 3 has the form 6 mk r 2 3 3 3 for such partitions we define the map f by the following list of nine case

because the largest part minus the smallest part modulo m is a supercrank witness ing every instance of divisibility of p n 3 by any such m for every prime m 1 25 mod 6 all of the same techniques still apply for proving and witnessing some di visibility of p n 3 modulo m but in this case we no longer know of a supercrank for even one such m as it turns out the largest part minus the smallest part modulo m still witnesses most of the divisibility of p n 3 by m however p n 3 enjoys two more arithmetic progressions of divisibility modulo primes 1 mod 6 and none of the techniques from sections 5 6 or 7 can account for this extra divisibility we describe this extra divisibility with an analog of proposition 2 1 below proposition 8 1 let m 6 j 1 be prime then p n 3 0 mod m if and only if n 0 1 2 2 m 1 2 m 2 3 m s m 1 mod 6 m where s satisfies s 2 3 mod m our combinatorial methods for proving theorem 3 4 work here to prove theorem 8 2 let m 6 j 1 be prime then cls largest part minus smallest part modulo m is a crank witnessing p 6 m k 0 1 2 2 m 2 2 m 1 3 0 mod m however the congruences p 6 m k 3 m s m 1 3 0 mod m from proposition 8 1 are resistant to our methods we have no combinatorial proof of p 6 m k 3 m s m 1 3 0 mod m nor do we know of a crank statistic that provides a combinatorial witness one explanation for why the same techniques do not provide a combinatorial proof of divisibility is that on the ehrhart side since 3 m s m 1 3 mod 6 our decomposition of p n 3 now produces triangles of three different sizes instead of just two because of these three different sizes it is impossible to rearrange the six triangles into a rectangle and so no ehrhart crank is forthcoming regarding divisibility of p n 3 by the remaining two primes 2 and 3 super cranks in both cases were found in 13 it is interesting to observe that the parity of the largest part minus smallest part again appears as a supercrank witnessing every instance of 2 p n 3 however the supercrank witnessing each and every instance of 3 p n 3 is a different statistic it is simply the largest part modulo 3 9 conclusion dyson s 70 year old request for a bijective proof that the rank witnesses ramanu jan s congruences modulo 5 and 7 remains unfulfilled since garvan kim and stanton made the remarkable stride of discovering purely bijective proofs of ra manujan s first four congruences along with new crank statistics witnessing them twenty five years ago 14 surprisingly little has been done treating congruences for partition functions using bijective methods in this paper we have taken two approaches to provide bijective proofs and combinatorial witnesses for every instance of divisibility of p n 3 by primes m 1 mod 6 as well as 9 11 ths of the divisibility by primes m 1 mod 6 the first approach is rooted in ehrhart theory remarkably although there are many ehrhart cranks one can construct using this approach that witness each of these 26 divisibilities one very well poised crank cls the largest part minus smallest part taken modulo m witnesses every single one the second approach relies upon creating a permutation of partitions whose cycle decomposition includes only cycles with lengths divisible by m a fact also witnessed by cls it remains to be seen if the fact that we have a supercrank for primes 1 mod 6 while the same crank only witnesses 9 11 ths of the divisibility by primes 1 mod 6 will lead to a critical insight or if the discrepancy is just an unremarkable property of the integers our hope here is that by revealing the structure of these sets of partitions in a new way and in a way that reveals why certain crank statistics witness divisibility of p n 3 we will open the gateway to a deeper understanding of other partition functions and their divisibility we have restricted our attention here to studying the geometry and combinatorics governing p n 3 however these methods can still be applied when d 3 and in 5 the authors treat this more general setting the authors would like to thank peter paule and the research institute for symbolic computation for their generous support of this research including support of
