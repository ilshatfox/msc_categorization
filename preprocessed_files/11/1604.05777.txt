extended norm trace codes with a gro bner basis of the ideal of the fqr rational points of the norm trace curve one can determine the dimension of the subfield subcodes or the dimension of the trace code we also find a bch like bound from the minimum distance of the original supercode ams subject classification primary 14 g 50 11 t 71 secondary 13 p 10 keywords coding theory gro bner bases binary

codes these codes include ag codes from some quasi hermitian curves and norm trace curves bch codes and binary classical goppa codes are subfield subcodes of rs codes and subfield subcodes of special ag codes of genus 0 curves i e very special mds codes these subfield subcodes inherit good parameters good automorphism groups and efficient encoding and decod ing algorithms from their ag supercode we have previously used gro bner bases in 5 to study subfield subcodes of hermitian curves we also found codes which are optimal or best known now we generalize these results to subfield subcodes of extended norm trace codes in this article we provide a gro bener basis framework and prove results that help us give explicit algorithms for computing the parameters of subfield subcodes of extended norm trace codes these results are easily adaptable to encoding and de coding we have implemented these algorithms in symbolic software we finish with some subfield subcodes of extended norm trace codes which ei ther have optimal parameters or are as good as any known code we fix q pl a prime power and r 1 a positive integer in addition t is a prime power such that ft fqr we denote the trace function of fqr over ft by tfqr ft note that tfqr ft y r 1 i 0 yq i 2 subfield subcodes for the material in this section we refer the reader to 6 definition 1 let c be a code over fqr of length n the subfield subcode of c is defined as c ft c f n t the trace code of c is defined as tfqr ft c tfqr ft c 1 tfqr ft c 2 tfqr ft cn c c both c ft and tfqr ft c are linear codes over ft of length n in fact proposition 1 6 delsarte s theorem let c be a code over fqr then c ft tfqr ft c 2 the map x 7 xt is an automorphism of fqr which fixes ft pointwise one extends this map to a linear space as follows definition 2 6 let c be a code over fqr of length n define c t ct 1 c t 2 c t n c c stichtenoth 6 showed that c ft and tfqr ft c may be seen as codes over fqr proposition 2 6 suppose qr tm let c be a code over fqr let c o m 1 i 0 c t i and c m 1 i 0 c t i then co is the fqr linear code spanned by c ft over fqr and c the fqr linear code spanned by tfqr ft c over fqr moreover co and c ft have the same dimension and minimum distance likewise c and tfqr ft c also have the same dimension and minimum distance 3 extended norm trace codes the extended norm trace curve and their associated linear codes were intro duced in 1 extended norm trace curves are defined in greater generality but for simplicity we fix u q r 1 q 1 definition 3 suppose v p 1 p 2 pn f m qr is a finite set and l is an fqr linear subspace of polynomials the affine variety code is defined as c v l f p 1 f p 2 f pn f l the trace code of an affine variety code is expressed in a simple way lemma 4 suppose v p 1 p 2 pn f m qr is a finite set and l is an fqr linear subspace of polynomials then tfqr ft c v l c v tfqr ft l c v m 1 i 0 l t i 3 proof let c tfqr ft c v l the vector c is equal to a vector of the form tfqr ft f p 1 tfqr ft f p 2 tfqr ft f pn for some f l there fore the codeword c g p 1 g p 2 g pn where g tfqr ft f this implies the codeword c is in the code c v tfqr ft l the converse is simi lar definition 5 the curve xu tfqr fq y 0 over fqr is known as the extended norm trace curve over fqr associated to q r and u denote by nt u x y f 2 qr x u tfqr fq y the authors in 1 note that nt u q r 1 u q 1 1 and the genus is qr 1 1 u 1 2 when u q r 1 q 1 the curve is a norm trace curve when r 2 the curve is a quasi hermitian curve definition 6 the qr 1 u weight of a monomial x iy j is qr 1 u x iy j qr 1 i uj we denote the set of all monomials whose qr 1 u weight is at most s by mqr 1 u s definition 7 for s the extended norm trace code of weight s is nt u s c nt u mqr 1 u s proposition 3 1 nt u s nt u q r 1 u 1 u qr 1 1 1 s 4 dimension of subfield subcodes our aim is to find or bound the dimension of nt u s ft lemma 8 dimnt u s ft n dim tfqr ft nt u q r 1 u 1 u qr 1 1 1 s proof the proof follows from proposition 3 and delsarte s theorem 4 as nt u s is an affine variety code lemma 4 implies tfqr ft nt u s is also an affine variety code we aim to determine or bound dim tfqr ft nt u s to do this we need to study the kernel of the evaluation map of the functions in m 1 i 0 mqr 1 u s ti on the points of nt u for this purpose we compute a gro bner basis for the ideal corresponding to nt u lemma 9 the ideal of polynomial functions which vanish on nt u is gen erated by xu tfqr fq y and x u q 1 1 x proof let i denote the ideal of polynomial functions which vanish on nt u this ideal is generated by xu tfqr fq y x qr x and y q r y the polynomial xu tfqr fq y q xu tfqr fq y x qu xu y q r y i as both xqu xu i and xq r x i their greatest common factor xu q 1 1 x is in the ideal as y q r y is a combination of xu tfqr fq y and xu q 1 1 x it follows that i is generated by xu tfqr fq y and xu q 1 1 x as the ideal of polynomial functions which vanish on nt u is the ideal generated by xu tfqr fq y and x u q 1 1 x we have the following corol lary corollary 10 f pi g pi pi nt u if and only if f g x u t y xu q 1 1 x proof two polynomials evaluate to the same function on nt u if and only if f g is in the ideal of polynomial functions which vanish on nt u as this ideal equal to xu t y xu q 1 1 x the proof now follows lemma 11 the qr 1 u weights of the support monomials of xu tfqr fq y are congruent mod q 1 u likewise the qr 1 u weights of the support of xu q 1 x are congruent mod q 1 u proof note that qr 1 u x u qru and qr 1 u y qi qiu as qu u q 1 u the result is true for xu tfqr fq y the q r 1 u weight of xu q 1 1 is qr 1 u q 1 1 corollary 12 if the qr 1 u weights of the monomials of the nonzero terms of f are congruent mod q 1 u then the qr 1 u weights of the monomials of the nonzero terms of f mod xu t y xq r x are also congruent mod q 1 u 5 in 4 we used simpler techniques to prove that lemmas 9 and 11 and corollary 12 hold for norm trace curves as there are fewer monomials but still a similar structure the computations will be faster for extended norm trace codes as the divisor u decreases as the authors state in 1 we can find a lower bound of the minimum distance of nt u s from the theory of order domain codes we use the following minimum distance bound from 2 proposition 4 2 let x iy j 0 i u q 1 0 j qr 1 then the minimum distance of nt u s is at least min p mu s k k s t p s t u k u p u k this lower bound is analogous to the bch bound this bound is an improvement on the minimum distance of subfield subcodes we use this to find the minimum distance of some subfield subcodes of extended norm trace codes as in the following examples 5 finding the codes in order to find the parameters of nt u s ft we use the minimum distance of the supercode nt u s itself as a lower bound on the minimum distance of the subfield subcode this bound is analogous to the bch bound in order to determine the dimension it is quite difficult to work with nt u s ft or with nt u s o delsarte s theorem allows us to work with the trace code of the dual code instead as dim tfqr ftnt u s dimnt u s we find the dimension of mu s reduced modulo the ideal of nt u 5 1 binary subcodes first we consider the extended norm trace curve given by x 3 y 8 y 4 y 2 y over f 16 we would like to find dimnt 3 36 f 2 the dual code nt 3 36 is equal tont 3 8 note thatm 3 8 1 y y 2 x thus m 3 8 is spanned by 1 y y 2 y 4 y 8 x x 2 x 4 x 8 now we reduce these monomials modulo nt 3 which is the ideal generated by the polynomials x 4 x and x 3 y 8 y 4 y 2 y in this case we can see that x 4 is equiv alent to x x 8 is equivalent to x 2 and y 8 is equivalent to x 3 y 4 y 2 y 6 therefore we find that tf 16 f 2 m 3 8 is generated by the independent poly nomials 1 y y 2 y 4 x 3 x x 2 thus dim tf 16 f 2 nt 3 8 7 and for the subfield subcode dimnt 3 36 f 2 25 following geil 2 the code nt 3 36 has minimum distance at least 3 however as tf 16 f 2 nt 3 8 contains the all ones codeword therefore all codewords of nt 3 36 f 2 have even weights thus nt 3 36 f 2 is an optimal 32 25 4 binary code now we consider the extended norm trace curve x 5 y 8 y 4 y 2 y over f 16 the code nt 5 65 has parameters 48 44 3 over f 16 the dual code is nt 5 65 nt 5 10 now we shall find dim tf 16 f 2 nt 5 10 in this case m 5 10 1 y y 2 x as in the previous case m 5 10 is spanned by the monomials 1 y y 2 y 4 y 8 x x 2 x 4 x 8 by considering reductions modulox 6 x andx 5 y 8 y 4 y 2 y we find that y 8 is equiva lent to x 3 y 4 y 2 y andx 8 is equivalent to x 3 therefore the evaluation y 8 is a linear combination of the evaluation of the other monomials and we obtain that tf 16 f 2 m 5 10 is generated by 1 y y 2 y 4 x x 2 x 4 x 3 thus dimtr nt 5 10 8 and dimnt 5 65 f 2 40 as in the previous example the code nt 5 65 has minimum distance at least 3 however as tr nt 5 10 contains the all ones codeword we obtain that nt 5 65 f 2 is an optimal 48 40 4 binary code 5 2 quaternary subcodes for the curve x 5 y 8 y 4 y 2 y we will study the codes nt 5 60 and nt 5 62 using geil s bound 2 on the minimum distance we find these are 48 43 3 and 48 44 3 codes over f 16 respectively if one reduces the monomials in m 5 60 4 modulo the ideal nt 5 one finds that the re ductions of the 43 monomials are contained in m 5 60 therefore the code nt 5 60 is invariant under the frobenius automorphism x 7 x 4 this im plies nt 5 60 nt 5 60 o and therefore there exists a 48 43 3 optimal quaternary code the reductions of the monomials in m 5 62 4 are also contained in m 5 62 the same argument implies there is also a 48 44 3 quaternary code the binary and quaternary codes found in this section have optimal min imum distance for their given dimension or have the best known minimum distance 3 7 references 1 maria bras amoro s and michael e o sullivan applied algebra alge braic algorithms and error correcting codes 17 th international sympo sium aaecc 17 bangalore india december
