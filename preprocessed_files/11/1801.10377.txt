for the auxiliary equation of waring s problem which seems a little simpler than the one introduced in 4 and give the same upper bounds of g k as the ones of the paper 4 and 8 keywords waring s problem hardy littlewood method iterative method auxiliary equation 1 introduction waring s problem is a well known problem in number theory the original statement is that for each natural number k there is a positive integer g k such that each natural numbers may be represented a sum of at most g k kth powers of natural numbers since the original problem was proved by hilbert and the values of g k have been almost completely known the modern version of the problem is to find the least integer g k such that each sufficient large integer may be represented a sum of at most g k kth powers of natural numbers in about 1920 s hardy ramanujan and littlewood proposed so called circle method which first appears hope in solving some problems of number theory since then many mathematicians such as vinogradov davenport hua chen vaughan wooley and others have made enduring and great efforts on exploiting hardy littlewood method and have succeed in progress for g k for the details is referred to see the vaughan and wooley s survey paper 6 suppose that n is a sufficient large integer for a given integer k denoted by p 1 kn for s integer sets 1 0 i ix i s x p denoted by 1 1 ki i i i s x x x i s a let m be the number of occurrences of number m ina that is the characteristic function of set a it is clear that 1 i i s x m m hence 2 2 2 01 1 i m m mi s x m m so 2 2 0 1 1 i m mi s x m the formula above indicates that 2 m m is more less the size a is more large when 1 i i s x given in hardy littlewood method an important work is to find as little as possible s and sets 1 ix i s such that 2 m m as small as possible and that seta is dense in 1 n with some sense let 1 2 sx x x x 2 s m s p x m it is clear that ss p x is the number of solutions of equation 1 1 1 k k k k s s i i ix x y y x y x i s the equation above is called auxiliary equation of waring problem earlier work such as vinogradov 7 and davenport 1 2 the selection of sets 1 ix i s are different from each other vaughan 4 creatively introduced a iterative method with the sets ix are same each other 1 ix p r i s a where p ra is a set of so called smooth integers in their papers ss p x is written as ss p r it is not difficult to imagine that there is a merit for such homogeneous construction is that it may be represented as a simple integral form which is favorable to be varied by h lder inequality this feature is reflected very well in the paper 4 in this paper we will present a new construction for domain set x of the auxiliary equation which is seemingly a little simpler than the one of smooth numbers in 4 and 8 but most arguments and results are almost same as ones in 4 and 8 with the new homogeneous construction we also obtain theorem 1 vaughan 1989 4 for sufficient large k log log 2 log log 1 log 2 log k g k k k k o k 1 1 theorem 2 wooley 1991 8 for sufficient large k log log 1 g k k k k o 1 2 2 the proof of theorem 1 p is sufficient great is a constant with that 1 k let 1 p p p is a set of prime numbers p in interval 2 p p write z p then we know 2 log z p p define recursively p x p x p p c c p 2 1 in this paper we simply write s ss p s p x as x p c lemma 1 2 1 s s s s ss p z s p z ps p 2 2 proof as usual write 2 ixe x e let k k k k x p x p y p f e x f p e p x f e y c c c then clearly k k p x p p f e p x f p p c p applying h lder s inequality it has 1 1 2 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 12 0 0 1 2 1 0 s s s s s p q s p q p q s s p q p q ss s s p q p q s p f d f f d f p f q d d z f d f p f q d z s p z f p f q d p p p p moreover let 1 sp q f p f q then by cauchy inequality it has 1 1 0 0 1 2 1 21 12 2 0 0 s sf p f q d p q q p d p q d q p d and 1 2 1 21 1 12 2 0 0 0 1 2 0 s s p q p q p q p q p q p q f p f q d p q d q p d p q d p p p denoted by p qt the inner integral which is the number of solutions of equation 1 2 1 1 2 1 k k k k k k k k k ks sp x x x y y y q y x 2 3 with 1 1 i ix y p x y p i s p q p q c c p hence it has that modk k ky x p by the definition we can know that for x p c it has 1 x p since the prime factors of element x less than p moreover we know that for an integer km p m there are at most finite solutions for the congruence modk kx m p so we may divide residue system kp into finite classes 1 k ip i l a l k such that there is at most one solution in each class ia for the congruence this means in one class ia k ky x mod kp implies y x mod kp and so here x y for 1 k in more detail let 1 i k k i i i x p p x x p x a f q e q x i l c c c where x represents the least non negative integer with that x x mod kp then 1 i i l f q f q and 1 12 2 1 2 0 0 2 1 2 1 0 1

k k k k k k ks sp x x x y y y q y x 2 4 with 1 1 j j ix y p j s x y p c c now for the equation 2 4 it has mod modk k k ky x p y x p y x for 1 k therefore 1 p q st ps p and 1 2 10 s s p q p q f p f q d z ps p p and then 2 1 s s s s ss p z s p z ps p corollary 1 suppose that sss p p then for 2 s 2 2 2 1 s s k s k k k 2 5 proof by lemma 1 it has 1 12 s s ss sp z p z p as s s and 2 log z p p so the first term of the right side of the inequality above is sub term may be omitted and hence 1 1 1 2 s s sp p i e 1 1 2 1 1 s s s 2 6 from the recursive inequality and the known result 2 2 with a simple calculate it follows 2 1 1 1 2 2 1 s s s let 1 k 5 is followed let 12 kkp 1 1 1 i for integers a q denotes 1 q a a q q m and for positive number w p denotes q a a q w q p n m is the union of the q am

j it should be mentioned that in the proof of lemma 7 we save the investigation for possible singular cases that is the cases ip x these cases may be treated as that divide the summation of i x into singular ones and normal part by h lder inequality the difference for the singular ones is delayed to the 1 i round it will be showed the singular ones are secondary and the number of singular ones is finite for a polynomial i hence it will be no effect for the result eventually in order that the differences can be carried out successively and efficiently to order k it should be i iu v 0 i k 3 6 at
