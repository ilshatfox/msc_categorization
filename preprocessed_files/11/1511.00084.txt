obtain the slopes of the q adic newton polygons of l functions of xd axd 1 fq x with respect to finite characters when p is larger than an explicit bound depending only on d and logp q the main tools are dwork s trace formula and zhu s rigid transform theorem 1 main results let q ph be a power of the rational prime number p let v be the normalized valuation on qp with v p 1 for a polynomial f x fq x let f zq x be its teichmu ller lifting for a finite character zp c p of order p m define the l function l f t exp m 1 s m f tm m 1 where s m f is the exponential sum s m f x qm 1 trqqm qp f x 2 and n is the group of n th roots of unity then l f t is a polynomial of degree pm 1 d by adolphson sperber as and liu wei lwe we denote npq f t the q adic newton polygon of l f t we fix a character 1 zp c p of order p and denote l f t l f 1 t and npq f t npq f 1 t when p 1 mod d it is well known that npq f t coincides the hodge polygon with slopes i d 0 i d 1 let a be a nonzero element in fq for f x x d axs s d liu niu and zhu obtained the slopes of npq f t for p large enough under certain conditions in ln 2 theorem 1 10 and z 2 but these conditions are not so easy to check for f x xd ax zhu liu niu and ouyang j yang obtained the slopes in z 2 theorem 1 1 ln 1 theorem 1 10 and oy theorem 1 1 see also r yang y 1 theorem for earlier results in dwx davis wan xiao gave a result on the behavior of the slopes of npq f t when the order of is large enough in this way for p sufficiently large they can obtain the slopes of npq f t based on the slopes of npq f 0 t with 0 a character of order p 2 in n niu gave a lower bound of the new ton polygon npq f t in oy theorem 4 3 ouyang yang showed that if the newton polygon of l f t is sufficiently close to its hodge polygon the slopes of npq f t for in general follow from the slopes of npq f t as a consequence 2010 mathematics subject classification primary 11 secondary 14 corresponding author s zhang email zsxqq mail ustc edu cn 1 http arxiv org

theorem 1 let f x xd axd 1 be a polynomial in fq x with a 6 0 let n d d 2 3 4 for q p and d 2 2 for general q if p 1 mod d and p n d the q adic newton polygon of l f t has slopes w 0 w 1 wd 1 where wi p 1 i d p 1 if i d 2 p 1 i d d p 1 1 2 if i d 2 p 1 i 2 d d p 1 if i d 2 remark 1 for general p write pi dki ri with 1 i ri d 1 if ri s for any 1 i s then one can decide that the first s 1 slopes of npq f t are 0 k 1 1 p 1 ks 1 p 1 by our method for sufficiently large p for the rest of slopes one needs to calculate the determinants of submatrices of vandermonde style matrices 2 the slopes in our case coincide zhu s result in z 2 theorem 2 assume f x and n d as above for any non trivial finite character if p 1 mod d and p max n d h d 2 1 4 d 1 the q adic newton polygon of l f t has slopes p 1

deta 1 s 1 deta let d 1 diag 0 d 1 d s d d 2 diag k 1 2 k 1 d 1 k 1 and b s 1 kifpi j 1 i j s then a d 1 1 d 2 b s d 1 it suffices to compute v detb s note that for s d 1 b d 1 a 11 o 2 a 1 d 2 o 2 1

i i d in theorem 4 we have v cs 1 h w 0 w 1 ws and npq det i tah d npp det i ta 1 d thus w 0 w 1 wd 1 are q adic slopes of npq det 1 i tah by theorem 3 det 1 i tah l f t det 1 i tqah since the valuation of any entry of ah is 0 the q adic slopes of det 1 i tah are 0 and the q adic slopes of det 1 i tqah are 1 thus any q adic slope of det 1 i tah less than 1 must be a q adic slope of l f t but l f t has degree d hence w 0 wd 1 are all slopes of l f t 3 2 the case for general let f x fq x be a polynomial with degree d assume p d let np f x be the piecewise linear function whose graph is the q adic newton polygon of det i tah let hp f x be the piecewise linear function whose graph is the polygon with vertices k k k 1 2 d k 0 1 2 newton polygons 7 then np f x hp f x cf lw oy set gap f max x 0 np f x hp f x theorem 8 see oy theorem 4 3 let 0 0 1 d 1 1 denote the slopes of the q adic newton polygon of l f t if gap f 1 h then the q adic newton polygon of l f t has slopes p 1 m i j 0 i p m 1 1 0 j d 1 for any non trivial finite character proof of theorem 2 the slopes of np f x are i wj i 0 0 j d 1 notice that d 1 i 0 wi d 1 i 0 i d np f x hp f x is a periodic function with period d for 0 k d np f x hp f x i d 1 2 2 i d p 1 d 2 1 4 d p 1 if p h d 2 1 4 d 1 then gap f 1 h and this concludes the proof acknowledgements this paper was prepared when the authors were visiting the
