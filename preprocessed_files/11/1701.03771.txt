ar x iv 1 70 1 03 77 1 v 1 m at h n t 1 3 ja n 20 17 a note on dirichlet l functions j b friedlander and h iwaniec abstract we study the relation between the size of l 1 and the width of the zero free interval to the left of that point 1 introduction let modd be a real primitive character of conductor d and l s 1 n n s its dirichlet l function we are interested in the size of l 1 the generalized riemann hypothsis implies 1 1 log logd 1 l 1 log logd unconditionally we have the easy upper bound l 1 logd but what one might expect to be the corresponding lower bound 1 2 l 1 logd 1 is not yet known to hold in general we know that 1 2 does hold apart from rare exceptions there is a similar situation with respect to the location of the largest real zero say of l s apart from rare exceptions one has the bound 1 3 1 logd 1 and one expects that this always holds moreover there is a close connection between the two phenomena and here we intend to study how close this is in one direction this is clear thanks to the following result of e hecke see e landau la theorem 1 if 1 3 holds then so does 1 2 supported in part by nserc grant a 5123 supported in part by nsf grant dms 1406981 1 http arxiv org abs 1701 03771 v 1 2 friedlander and iwaniec in this note we make a modest step toward the reversal of this im plication it is easy to see from the equation l s n 6 d n log n n s o d 1 2 logd 2 valid if s 1 logd 1 that 1 4 l s logd 2 there and hence by the mean value theorem of differential calculus that 1 5 1 logd 3 implies 1 6 l 1 logd 1 using deeper arguments we can say a bit more theorem 2 if l s has a real zero with 1 7 1 logd 3 log logd then 1 6 holds it seems surprising not to be able to do better one expects in the case of an extremely small value of l 1 that mimics the mo bius function and in such a situation l s rather than being limited by 1 4 should be almost though not quite bounded hence that 1 2 should imply something only slightly weaker than 1 3 the limitation in the bound of theorem 2 comes from our imperfect knowledge about the complex zeros at the end of this note we describe in theorem 3 how the bound can be substantially sharpened if we assume the riemann hypothsis holds apart from an exceptional real zero there is an extensive literature on the subject discussed in this note we encourage the reader to obtain a broader perspective through the publications gosc go pi mv grso saza 2 relations between and l 1 from now on we assume that 1 6 3 logd 1 denote 1 and z s s l s 1 n n s a note on dirichlet l functions 3 we evaluate the smoothly cropped sum 2 1 s x n 6 x n 1 n x n by contour integration of z s as follows s x 1 2 i 1 z s xs s s 1 ds l 1 x 1 1 2 o x 1 d 1 2 logd hence proposition 2 1 assume l s has a real zero with 1 6 3 logd 1 then 2 2 l 1 1 s d therefore our problem reduces to the estimation of s d note that trivially s d 1 and this gives hecke s theorem 1 3 upper bound for s d we have 3 1 s d n 6 d n n p 6 d 1 p p we split this product into 3 2 p 6 b 1 p p 6 p 6 b 1 2 p logb 2 and 3 3 b p 6 d 1 p p 6 exp t d logb where 3 4 t d p 6 d p p log p up to now our estimates have been rather simple but to estimate t d we require deeper tools namely the deuring heilbronn repulsion property of put 3 5 1 1 logd 3 4 friedlander and iwaniec the repulsion property asserts that l s has no zeros other than in the region 1 c log logd t 1 s it where c is an absolute positive constant cf the ore me 16 of e bombieri b a very nice way of using the repulsion property together with a quite delicate estimate for the number of zeros of l s in small discs centered on re s 1 cf ch x lemma 2 1 of pr to bound sums of p over primes has been given by d r heath brown we borrow from his work the estimate lemma 3 of h b 1 3 6 t d log 1 2 logd choosing logb log 1 2 logd we obtain 3 7 s d log 1 logd 2 4 conclusion from 2 2 and 3 7 we get 4 1 l 1 1 log logd 2 in particular if satisfies 1 7 then logd and 4 1 gives 1 6 5 remarks behind the scenes we take this opportunity to share some of our impressions about the nature of the arguments used in this note the main issue is the question of how the exceptional zero is connected with the rarity of small primes which split in the quadratic field q 1 d a quick connection is displayed in the bound see 24 20 of fi 4 5 1 z p 6 x p p 1 1 log x valid for x z d 2 this shows that if 5 2 1 o 1 logd then the splitting primes in the segments d 2 p 6 da are very rare one can easily deduce the same conclusion from the assumption see 24 19 of fi 4 5 3 l 1 o 1 logd a note on dirichlet l functions 5 the deficiency of such primes is the driving force for finding prime numbers in many interesting sequences cf h b 1 h b 2 fi 3 one of these is the proof by heath brown that the existence of infinitely many exceptional zeros implies the existence of infinitely many twin primes another example is the implication to primes of the form p a 2 b 6 in our series of papers fi 1 fi 5 we used assumptions of type 5 3 rather than 5 2 and for those applications they serve the same pur pose note that 5 1 says nothing about splitting primes which are very small relative to the conductor d in all of these applications the rarity of small splitting primes was not needed but for theorem 2 it is essential the current technology allows one to penetrate this territory but only barely due to the deuring heilbronn repulsion property of the exceptional zero heath brown s lemma 3 of h b 1 does just that we include for curiosity an alternative derivation of 2 2 we con sider the function 5 4 f s e d sl s 1 which satisfies the conditions f 1 0 f 0 l 1 f 0 l 1 logd l 1 and f s logd 3 if s 1 logd 1 hence by the taylor expansion of f 1 at s 0 we get 5 5 l 1 1 l 1 logd l 1 o 1 2 logd 3 on the other hand we have cf 22 109 of ik 5 6 n 6 d n n 1 l 1 logd l 1 o d 1 4 logd combining 5 5 and 5 6 we obtain 5 7 l 1 1 n 6 d n n 1 o 1 logd 3 1 d 1 4 for our purposes 5 7 and 2 2 amount to the same thing note that under the assumption 5 3 the formula 5 7 implies 5 8 l 1 n 6 d n n 1 which can be compared with 22 117 of ik 6 friedlander and iwaniec there are infinitely many real primitive characters modd with d prime and p 1 for every p c logd for such characters we have 5 9 n 6 d n n 1 log logd 2 hence if the largest real zero of l s satisfies 3 5 we have 5 10 l 1 1 log logd 2 therefore 1 6 cannot hold for such special discriminants unless l s has a zero with 1 logd 1 log logd 2 6 the ultimate deuring heilbronn phenomenon in this final section we investigate the extent of improvement in the conclusion of theorem 2 which could be obtained if one assumed the grh for l s apart from one real zero let us assume that 3 4 is the only zero of l s in re s 3 4 we proceed along the lines of j e littlewood li beginning with the formula cf 5 58 of ik 6 1 l l n 6 x n n 1 n x n 1 1 1 x o x 1 2 logd which is valid for 1 6 6 5 4 with any x 1 the implied constant being absolute here runs through the zeros of l s in the critical strip separating and estimating the other terms trivially we find 6 2 l l n 6 x n n n 1 1 1 x o 1 x 1 4 logd we take x logd 4 so the error term in 6 2 is bounded integrating 6 2 over 1 6 6 5 4 we obtain logl 1 p 6 x p p 5 4 1 x tt 1 1 t 1 dt o 1 up to a bounded error term the integral is equal to 1 x tt 1 dt e tt 1 dt e log e t log t dt a note on dirichlet l functions 7 where 1 log x here we have e log log 1 o 1 and the last integral is bounded hence logl 1 p 6 x p p 1 log 1 o 1 in other words 6 3 l 1 exp p 6 logd p p 1 where 6 4 min 1 1 log logd this proves theorem 3 assuming that 3 4 is the only zero of l s in re s 3 4 we have 6 3 hence 6 5 log logd 1 l 1 log logd in particular if 1 log logd 1 then 6 6 1 l 1 1 log logd 2 references b e bombieri
