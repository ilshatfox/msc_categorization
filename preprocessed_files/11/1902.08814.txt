denote by a h the smallest positive integer that can be represented as a sum of h and no less than h elements in sa nathanson studied the properties of the a h sequence and posed the problem of finding the values of a h when a 2 i we represent a h by 2 i h only the values 2 3 1 1 2 3 3 5 2 3 3 21 and 2 3 4 150 are known in this paper we extend this result for any odd i 1 and h 1 2 3 we find the values of 2 i h furthermore for fixed h 1 2 3 we find the values of 2 i h that occur infinitely many times as i runs over the odd integers bigger than 1 we call these numbers the limit points of nathanson s lambda sequences 1 introduction we begin with the generating set an j 0 j n n j j n 0 1 2 n 2 for any finite set a of positive integers bigger than 1 and sa a aaa we can represent any positive integer k as a sum of elements of the set sa in the form k a j 0 j j associated with the above representation of k is the length function which is defined as la k j 0 1 2 a j this representation of integers follows naturally from the special g adic representations of positive integers outlined in sections 1 1 and 1 2 below we will now proceed to define the a h function definition 1 for every positive integer h let a h denote the smallest positive integer that can be represented as the sum of elements of sa with length h but that cannot be represented as a sum with length less than h for ease of notation we will write 2 n h 2 n h and l 2 n k l 2 n k the lambda values are very important in geometric group theory and additive number theory nathanson in 6 7 and 8 did extensive work in solving some of these problems and derived important properties of the a h sequences in the process these a h sequences originate from the study of groups generators and metric spaces and their existence can be traced back to jarden date february 26 2019 1 http arxiv org abs 1902 08814 v 1 limit points of nathanson s lambda sequences 2 and narkiewicz in 4 and hajdu in 1 this work was further extended by hajdu and tijdeman in 2 where they found non trivial bounds for the terms of the a h sequences and in 3 where they considered sums and differences of power products additional extensions were done by berto k in 5 by considering representations as power products with non prime bases very few terms are known for nathanson s lambda sequences even in the simplest of cases such as 2 3 h where one needs to consider representations of integers only as sums and differences of powers of two s and three s in fact only the first four terms 2 3 1 1 2 3 2 5 2 3 3 21 and 2 3 4 150 are known see 7 and 10 a similar function is considered by dimitrov and howe in 9 where representations are generated from sums and differences of the product of powers of 2 s and 3 s in this paper we will extend work on nathanson s lambda sequences by finding the values of 2 n h for h 1 2 3 and odd n 1 for fixed h 1 2 3 we also find the values of 2 i h that occur infinitely many times as i runs over the odd integers bigger than 1 we will now discuss the case when the cardinality of a denoted by a is 1 i e a m and sa am this will provide us with a useful tool to compute lambda values in this case nathanson s algorithms in 7 allow us to represent positive integers in special m adic form uniquely and with shortest length we will denote these lengths by l m k to find terms of the lambda sequences we only require shortest length representations uniqueness is not necessary this is prevalent for a 1 and in particular for representations of integers from a 2 an for odd n 1 we now outline the algorithms 1 1 generating special 2 adic representations a we begin by writing the positive integer n as a standard binary expansion in the unique binary form m i 0 i 2 i where i 0 1 b if there are t consecutive sums of powers of 2 i e i i 1 i t 1 1 for t 2 then we rewrite i t 1 j i 2 j 2 i t 2 i notice that this shortens the number of terms from t to 2 for t 2 after performing the above step on all consecutive blocks of powers of 2 if we end up with s consecutive negative terms of powers of 2 then by a similar argument we see that i i 1 i s 1 1 and i s 1 j i 2 j 2 i s 2 i c if we have two consecutive terms with opposite signs say the k and k 1 terms then we combine them in the following manner 2 k 2 k 1 2 k or 2 k 2 k 1 2 k to convert them into a single term d if identical powers of 2 s occur with opposite signs after implementing the above steps cancel them if a term of the form m 2 j occurs where m 2 r then coalesce them into 2 j r if m 6 2 j then write the binary expansion of m and multiply each power of two in this expansion by 2 j after repeating these steps a finite number of times there will be no consecutive terms and the process will terminate to give us a minimum special 2 adic expansion of our integer for example using the above algorithm we can write 473 29 25 23 20 and it follows that l 2 473 4 1 2 generating special g adic representations for odd g 1 a take any positive integer n and write n it in the standard base g representation n i 0 ig i with i 0 1 2 g 1 for all i limit points of nathanson s lambda sequences 3 b if g 1 2 i g 1 for some i then choose the smallest such i and apply the identity ig i g i g i gi 1 c if g 1 i g 1 2 for some i then apply the identity ig i g i g i gi 1 d delete all occurrences of 0 e if gi and gi occur delete them f if gi resp gi occurs g times replace these g summands with the one summand gi 1 resp gi 1 by iterating the above process we get a special g adic representation of n for example 39797 written as a special 9 adic representation is 39797 1 95 3 94 1 93 4 92 3 91 1 90 and it follows that l 9 39797 13 in the next section we will examine representations of positive integers with elements from s 2 n for odd n 1 in particular we will find the values of 2 n h for h 1 2 and 3 2 computing 2 n h for h 1 2 3 and odd n 1 it is clear that representations of numbers from a 2 and an are also representations from a 2 n in addition l 2 n k l 2 n where l 2 n k denote the minimal length of k in s 2 n a 2 an we will now proceed to compute the values of 2 n h for h 1 2 3 and any odd n 1 we begin with an example to compute some lambda values example 1 2 5 1 1 2 5 2 3 and 2 5 3 19 we represent the first twenty positive integers using elements from a 2 a 5 0 2 j j 0 1 2 3 1 5 m m 0 1 2 2 5 k k 0 1 2 and list their corresponding lengths in table 1 our task is to identify the first number with a representation of shortest length one to get 2 5 1 which is trivially 1 similarly we identify the first number with shortest length 2 to get 2 5 2 and so on we observe that we can represent 1 and 2 as numbers with lengths 1 namely 1 20 and 2 21 clearly 3 cannot have length 1 but it has several representations with length 2 this readily follows since the equations 2 1 3 2 5 2 3 and 5 3 3 are insoluble in n the set of positive integers and one representation of 3 with length 2 is 1 21 1 51 the first number with length three is 19 to see this we need to establish that l 2 5 19 3 and as such that 2 1 19 2 2 2 3 19 5 4 19 2 5 5 19 5 6 5 7 19 2 8 5 9 19 are all insoluble by nathanson s algorithms we see that l 2 19 l 2 1 2 4 1 21 1 20 3 and l 5 19 l 2 1 5 2 1 51 1 50 3 which establish the insolubility of all the equations except for 2 8 5 9 19 this latter system s insolubility is established in the proof of theorem 2 and it follows that l 2 5 19 3 we will now prove some results that are essential to the establishment of 2 n h for h 1 2 3 and odd n 1 limit points of nathanson s

p it readily follows from k 1 k 1 that l p k 1 for the rest of the paper we will write representations of the form 1 an as an lemma 1 l 2 n t 2 for t q where q 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 12 14 15 16 17 18 20 24 proof for t q l 2 t 2 which is seen from the special 2 adic algorithm in section 1 1 we list the shortest length representations of the elements of q from a 2 1 1 2 2 3 1 2 2 4 22 5 1 22 6 2 23

pay particular attention to the number 11 and consider its representations and length in the special n adic form for odd n we will classify all odd n s with l 2 n 11 2 lemma 2 for odd n 1 l 2 n 11 1

statement is trivial for the second part when u s it readily follows that l 2 u 11 2 since the elements in s satisfy the equation 11 2 c u and from the first part we see that l 2 u 11 6 1 lemma 3 for

equation 13 2 d v and from the first part we see that l 2 u 13 6 1 lemma 4 t s 3 5 9 15 19 21 proof this intersection follows by finding all the solutions of the equations below n 1 2 c 1 13 2 c 2 11

sequences 6 the positive odd solutions are 3 5 9 15 19 21 we now establish that there are no other solutions for equation 7 2 u 1 2 u 2 2 we can consider 2 u 1 2 2 u 2 which has the solution u 1 u 2 0 and it is clearly insoluble for u 2 1 since we get 2 u 1 0 for the equations of the shape 2 m 2 n 2 namely equations 1 5 9 clearly m n and we can write m n from which it follows that 2 n 2 1 2 and the only solution occurs when n 1 and 1 for the equations of the shape 2 m 2 n 24 namely equations 6 8 we can consider 2 m 24 2 n which has the solutions m 3 n 4 and m 4 n 3 it is clearly insoluble for n

l 2 n 13 3 for n s r 3 5 9 15 19 21 proof for any n s by lemmas 1 2 3 and 4 and the fact that l 2 13 l 2 1 2 2 24 3 the claim follows we will now proceed to establish 2 n h for h 1 2 3 and odd n 1 it is a routine calcula tion to show that 2 3 2 5 see for example 7 proposition 3 2 n 1 1 and 2 n 2 3 for any odd integer n 5 n n proof 2 n 1 1 is trivial and 2 n 2 3 follows from the fact that l 2 1 l 2 2 1 l 2 3 2 and the diophantine equations 2 a 3 and nb 3 are insoluble corollary 1 the limit point of 2 n 1 is 1 and that of 2 n 2 is 3 proof the corollary follows immediately from proposition 3 we have seen in lemma 4 that t s 3 5 9 15 19 21 and that 11 13 are also points of interest since l 2 11 11 1 l 2 11 13 l 2 11 2 11 3 l 2 13 13 1 and l 2 13 11 l 2 13 2 13 2 which readily follows from remark 1 and the insolubility of 13 t 11 and 11 s 13 it follows that in the computation of 2 n 3 we need to consider the set of outliers for limit points of nathanson s lambda sequences 7 n 3 5 9 11 13 15 19 21 separately we will now state our main result which will allow us to find all limit points of 2 n 3 theorem 1 for odd n 1 where s is the set defined in lemma 2 we have that 2 n 3 11 for n s 11 13 for n s r 3 5 9 11 13 15 19 21 proof from lemma 1 we have that l 2 n t 2 for t 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 12 using this fact and propositions 1 and 2 our theorem follows corollary 2 the limit points of 2 n 3 are 11 and 13 proof the corollary follows immediately from theorem 1 and s theorem 2 2 3 3 21 2 5 3 19 2 9 3 19 2 11 3 23 2 13 3 22 2 15 3 21 2 19 3 22 2 21 3 26 proof 2 3 3 21 see 7 now consider the pairs g k 2 g where g k 2 g 5 19 9 19 11 23 13 22 15 21 19 22 21 26 for integer valued x where 1 x k 2 g we will first establish that l 2 g x 2 an application of lemmas 1 and 4 shows that l 2 g x 2 for x q q 11 13 for each g 5 9 15 19 21 we will now consider the values of x q but in the interval 1 x k 2 g and their appropriate representations to show that l 2 g x 2 for g 5 9 x q
