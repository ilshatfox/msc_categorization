vdw n k defined as the simplicial complex whose facets correspond to arithmetic progressions of length k in the vertex set 1 2 n we show the van der waerden complex vdw n k is homotopy equivalent to a cw complex whose cells asymptotically have dimension at most log k log log k furthermore we give bounds on n and k which imply that the van der waerden complex is contractible 1 introduction a number of recent papers have considered the topology of cell complexes associated to number theoretic concepts these include bjo rner s study of the betti numbers and homotopy type of a simplicial complex whose euler characteristic is the negative of the mertens function as well as a related cw complex whose euler characteristic is the summatory liouville function 1 musiker and reiner s work describing the coefficients of the cyclotomic polynomial as the torsion homology of a sequence of simplicial complexes 8 and pakianathan and winfree s topological reformulations of number theoretic conjectures using threshold complexes 9 recall that van der waerden s theorem from ramsey theory states that given positive integers k and r there is an integer m m k r so that when the integers 1 through n with n m are colored with r colors there is a monochromatic arithmetic progression of length k 11 there is an upper bound for m k r due to gowers coming out of his proof of szemeredi s theorem 3 motivated by van der waerden s theorem we define the van der waerden complex vdw n k to be the simplicial complex on the vertex set 1 2 n whose facets correspond to all arithmetic progressions of length k that is the facets have the form x x d x 2 d x k d where d is a positive integer and 1 x x k d n observe that the van der waerden complex vdw n k is a simplicial complex of dimension k that is each facet has dimension k furthermore when k 1 the complex vdw n 1 is the complete graph kn which is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of n 1 2 circles this paper is concerned with understanding the topology of the van der waerden complex by constructing a discrete morse matching we show that the dimension of the homotopy type of the van der waerden complex is bounded above by the maximum of the number of distinct primes factors of all positive integers less than or equal to k see theorem 3 8 this bound is asymptotically described as log k log log k see theorem 3 11 in section 4 we give bounds under which the van der waerden complex is contractible we then look at the implications of our results when studying the topology of the family of van der waerden complexes vdw 5 k k where k is any positive integer we end with open questions in the concluding remarks 1 http arxiv org abs 1605 00663 v 2 2 preliminaries let p be the set of positive integers let n denote the set 1 2 n and i j denote the interval i i 1 j definition 2 1 the van der waerden complex vdw n k is the simplicial complex on the vertex set n whose facets correspond to all arithmetic progressions of length k in n that is the facets have the form x x d x 2 d x k d where d is a positive integer and 1 x x k d n we remark that the van der waerden complex is not monotone in the variable k for instance the set 1 4 7 is a facet in vdw 7 2 but is not a face of vdw 7 3 let p be a finite partially ordered set poset with partial order relation for further information on posets see 10 chapter 3 a matching m on p is a collection of disjoint pairs of elements of p such that x y for each pair x y m given a matching m we define the two partial functions u and d on p as u x y and d y x when x y m definition 2 2 a matching m on a poset p is a discrete morse matching if there do not exist elements x 1 x 2 xj such that x 1 u x 1 x 2 u x 2 xj u xj x 1 one can describe this definition in more concrete terms in the hasse diagram of the poset p direct all of the edges upward except for those in the matching m these are directed downward the matching m is a discrete morse matching if and only if the resulting directed graph has no directed cycles hence a discrete morse matching is also known as an acyclic matching one way to construct an acyclic matching is by taking the union of acyclic matchings on subposets as detailed below for details see 6 theorem 11 10 theorem 2 3 patchwork theorem let p q be an order preserving map between the two posets p and q suppose that a discrete morse matching exists on each subposet 1 q for every q q then the union of these matchings is itself a discrete morse matching on p an element in the poset p that does not belong to matching m is called critical we can now state the main theorem of discrete morse theory 2 theorem 2 5 theorem 2 4 forman let be a simplicial complex and let m be a discrete morse matching on the face poset of let ci denote the number of critical elements of dimension i then the simplical complex is homotopy equivalent to a cw complex consisting of ci cells of dimension i for i 0 a cw complex consisting of one 0 dimensional cell and c i dimensional cell is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of c i dimensional spheres combining this observation with theorem 2 4 we have the following result proposition 2 5 let be a simplicial complex and let m be a discrete morse matching on if there only are c critical cells of dimension i 0 and one critical cell of dimension 0 then is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of c spheres each of dimension i for a detailed treatment of the theory of cw complexes we direct the reader to 5 2 3 a bound on the dimension of the homotopy type we begin by studying a family of sets that we use as building blocks in order to understand the van der waerden complex definition 3 1 define k to be the family of subsets given by k f 0 k f 0 k gcd f 1 where 0 k 0 1 k and gcd f denotes the greatest common divisor of the elements of f in other words k is the family of all subsets containing the pair 0 k and contained in the interval 0 k such that the only arithmetic sequence from 0 to k containing this family is the entire interval 0 k even though k is not a simplicial complex we refer to the sets in the collection k as faces lemma 3 2 let k be a positive integer which is not squarefree then the family k has a discrete morse matching with no critical cells proof let s denote the product of all of the distinct primes dividing k since k is not squarefree we have that s k let f be a face in k such that s 6 f note that gcd f s gcd 1 s 1 thus the union f s also belongs to the family k similarly if we have a face f in k such that s f we claim that f s is also a face of k assume that the prime p divides gcd f s it follows from k f s that p k since s is the squarefree part of k the prime p also divides s this yields the contradiction that p divides gcd gcd f s s gcd f 1 hence we conclude that the set difference f s is also in the family k proving the claim given a face f match it with the symmetric difference f s this defines an acyclic matching on k with no critical cells as claimed proposition 3 3 let k be a squarefree positive integer there exists a discrete morse matching on the family k which has only one critical cell given by 0 k k q q k and q prime proof the proof is by induction on the number of prime factors of k if there are no prime factors that is k 1 then 1 only consists of the set 0 1 which is then the only critical cell assume now that k has at least one prime factor p we begin to create the matching as follows let f be a set such that k p 6 f and gcd f 1 note that gcd f 1 implies that gcd f k p gcd gcd f k p 1 hence the two sets f and f k p are faces of k match these two faces note that among the elements that have been matched so far there is no directed cycle the remaining unmatched faces are of the form f k p where k p 6 f gcd f 6 1 and gcd f k p 1 observe that gcd gcd f k p 1 since gcd f divides k the only option for gcd f is the prime p the unmatched faces are described by f k p where k p 6 f and gcd f p note these sets f are in bijection with faces in the family k p by sending f to the 3 set f p i p i f that is the faces of k which have not yet been matched are the image of the map g p g k p applied to the family k p by the induction hypothesis we can find a morse matching for k p where the only critical cell is given by c 0 k p k pq q k p and q prime by applying the map to the morse matching of k p we obtain a matching on the unmatched cells of k the only remaining unmatched cell is c 0 k k q q k p and q prime k p this is the claimed unmatched face by induction there are no directed cycles in the image k p furthermore since the image k p lies in ranks which are less than that of the elements which were first matched there can be no directed cycles between these two parts hence we conclude the matching constructed is a morse matching this completes the induction hypothesis and the proof as an application the matching constructed in lemma 3 2 and proposition 3 3 yields a combi natorial identity for the number theoretic mo bius function recall for a positive integer k that the mo bius function is defined by k 1 r if k is square free and has r prime factors 0 if k is not square free corollary 3 4 for k a positive integer the mo bius function k is given by k f k 1 f proof the matching of lemma 3 2 and proposition 3 3 yields a sign reversing involution on the set k the only unmatched face f 0 k k q q k and q prime occurs when k is squarefree and it satisfies 1 f 1 prime factors of k k for 1 x y n define the set d n k x y by d n k x y d p d y x and x x d y vdw n k the following inclusion holds d n k x y d p d y x and y x d k 3 1 in general this inclusion is not an equality since the right hand side does not depend on n the following example illustrates this phenomenon example 3 5 consider the case n 7 and k 3 we have that 1 7 is an edge in vdw 7 3 since it is contained in the facet 1 3 5 7 in fact d 7 3 1 7 2 6 whereas the right hand side of equation 3 1 is given by the set 2 3 6 4 the following notion will be useful in what follows definition 3 6 for a finite non empty set s s 1 s 2 sj of positive integers define the greatest common divisor after translation as gcdtr s gcd s 2 s 1 s 3 s 1 sj s 1 observe that gcdtr s is the largest divisor d of the difference max s min s for which min s min s d max s d max s is an arithmetic progression that contains s proposition 3 7 the van der waerden complex vdw n k can be expressed as the disjoint union vdw n k 1 2 n 1 x y n d d n k x y d y x d x where d j x denotes the family d f x f j and d f x denotes the set d i x i f proof let f be a face in vdw n k if the face has cardinality at most 1 then it belongs to the family 1 2 n otherwise it has cardinality at least 2 for such a face let x min f y max f and d gcdtr f note that the face f is a subset of d y x d x this yields the decomposition we now use the aforementioned acyclic matching to obtain bounds for the dimension of the cells of a cw complex which is homotopy equivalent to the complex vdw n k our bounds are stated in terms of the primorial function x which is defined as the product x p x p where p ranges over all primes less than or equal to x let pi denote the ith prime the product of the r first primes is then given by pr theorem 3 8 let n k and r be positive integers such that k pr then the van der waerden complex vdw n k is homotopy equivalent to a cw complex whose cells have dimension at most r proof the case k 1 follows directly from the fact that vdw n 1 is the complete graphkn consider the case when k 1 define the poset q by q x y d n 3 1 x y n y x 2 d d n k x y 0 with partial order defined by x y d q x y d if x x y y and d d and 0 q z for all z q we also define the map vdw n k q as f min f max f gcdtr f if max f min f 2 0 otherwise note that is order preserving also for x y d q the fiber 1 x y d is given by the family d y x d x finally the fiber 1 0 consists of singletons and the pairs i i 1 where 1 i n 5 the fibers of the map yield the decomposition of the complex vdw n k in proposition 3 7 furthermore the fiber 1 0 has an acyclic matching where the singleton i is matched with the pair i i 1 the other fibers each have an acyclic matching by lemma 3 2 and proposition 3 3 finally we apply theorem 2 3 to conclude that the union of the aforementioned acyclic matchings is itself an acyclic matching on all of vdw n k the singleton n is the only critical cell in the fiber 1 0 if y x d is not squarefree then there are no critical cells in the fiber 1 x y d on the other hand if y x d is squarefree then the fiber 1 x y d has exactly one critical cell with cardinality at most 2 plus the number of distinct primes factors of y x d since the inequality y x d k pr holds the number of prime factors of y x d is at most r 1 hence the size of the critical cells in our acyclic matching is at most r 1 that is their dimensions are at most r corollary 3 9 if k pr then the ith reduced homology group h i vdw n k of the van der waerden complex vanishes for i r 1 we end this section by considering the asymptotic behavior of r as k tends to infinity recall lim r log pr r log log pr 1 3 2 see the beginning of section 22 10 in 4 just before theorem 430 theorem 3 10 let r k be the unique positive integer r such that the inequalities pr 1 k pr hold then the following asymptotic result holds r k log k log log k as k proof note that the function log x log log x is increasing for x ee hence for sufficiently large k take k 30 we have the two inequalities r 1 r log pr 1 r 1 log log pr 1 log k r log log k log pr r log log pr where r r k note that r k as k hence by equation 3 2 both the right hand and left hand sides of the above bound tend to 1 as k thus the asymptotic follows by the squeeze theorem we can now state an asymptotic version of our homotopy equivalence dimension bound theorem 3 11 the van der waerden complex vdw n k is homotopy equivalent to a cw complex whose cells have dimension asymptotically at most log k log log k 4 bounds for contractible complexes recall that for a prime p and integer s that pr s means that r is the largest power of p dividing s that is pr s but pr 1 6 s 6 proposition 4 1 for an integer a 1 let l a lcm 1 2 a let p be a prime such that p l for 1 let k be an integer greater than or equal to l a p 1 and let n be an integer bounded by a k n a 1 k then the van der waerden complex vdw n k is contractible proof define the poset q as q x y n 2 1 x y n y x 2 0 with the partial order relation given by x y q x y if x x y y and 0 q z for all z q we also define the map vdw n k q as f min f max f if max f min f 2 0 otherwise note that is order preserving as in the proof of theorem 3 8 the fiber 1 0 consists of singletons and the pairs i i 1 such that 1 i n again we match the singleton i with the pair i i 1 leaving us with the critical cell n we will now describe a matching on the fiber 1 x y for x y q we have that x y is an edge of vdw n k and that y x 2 note that all facets of vdw n k have steps at most a since for any b a the difference between z b k and z is greater than n 1 let s be the set of steps of the facets containing the edge x y that is s d p x y z z d z k d n note that s is a non empty subset of a next let t be the set of minimal elements of s with respect to divisibility we have that d y x for all d t thus the least common multiple lcm t also divides y x also note that lcm t lcm s l a p 1 k we claim that y x 6 lcm t to reach a contradiction suppose that y x lcm t note that 1 6 t since if the element 1 did belong to t the set t would be the singleton 1 implying that y x lcm t 1 which contradicts y x 2 factor l a as p c where c is not divisible by p assume now that y x factors as p c such that p does not divide c since y x lcm t divides l a we have that c c and we have two cases to consider the first case is 1 we have the following string of inequalities y x p c p c p c l a p 1 k this shows that the edge x y is contained in an edge of step 1 yielding the contradiction 1 t the second case is 2 we then have y x p c p c p l a p p 1 l a p 1 p 1 k we now claim that there is a facet with step p 1 that contains the edge x y since p di vides l a we have the inequality p a we have the following string of inequalities k 1 p 1 k p 1 p 1 k p 1 k p 1 p 1 k p k p k a n 7 hence the arithmetic sequence f p 1 2 p 1 k 1 p 1 which has step size p 1 and length k is contained in the vertex set n that is f is indeed a facet by shifting this facet f we obtain all the facets of step p 1 f p 1 1 f p 1 2 f f n k 1 p 1 since p 1 divides y x and y x k p 1 one of the above facets contains the edge x y proving the claim hence the element p 1 belongs to s either p 1 is a minimal element of s or it is not let p be an element of t that is less than or equal to p 1 in the divisor order that is 1 consider another element t in t that is t 6 p we have that p t implies that hence p is the largest p power that divides lcm t since 1 this contradicts the fact that p is the smallest power of p dividing lcm t y x this proves our claim thus we conclude that lcm t y x we now continue to construct our matching on the fiber 1 x y as follows for a face f vdw n k such that f x y we match f with the symmetric difference f x lcm t this is well defined because if the sum x lcm t does not belong to the face f then f x lcm t is also a face of the complex note that this matching on the fiber 1 x y is acyclic and has no critical cells finally we apply theorem 2 3 to conclude that the union of the aforementioned acyclic matchings is an acyclic matching on vdw n k with the unique critical cell n it follows that the complex vdw n k is contractible directly we have the following result proposition 4 2 let a 1 be an integer and define l a as in proposition 4 1 let p 1 1 p 2 2 p m m be the prime factorization of l a let m a be the maximum of the set p 1 11 p 2 1 2 p m 1 m let k be an integer greater than or equal to l a m a and let n be an integer bounded by a k n a 1 k then the van der waerden complex vdw n k is contractible remark the prime p in m a p 1 must be 2 or 3 to see this suppose that p 5 since 22 p we have that p 1 2 1 2 p so there are at least two 2 powers between p 1 and p note that 2 p a hence the maximum m a cannot be given by p 1 lemma 4 3 view l and m in the previous proposition as functions in the variable a then the quotient l m is a weakly increasing function in a proof first consider when a is not a prime power we have l a 1 l a and hence m a 1 m a thus the two quotients l a 1 m a 1 and l a m a are equal next assume that a is the prime power p then l a increases by a factor of p that is l a p l a 1 if m a 1 m a then l a m a p l a 1 m a 1 l a 1 m a 1 on the other hand if m a 6 m a 1 then we have that m a p 1 note now that m a 1 p 2 we thus have l a 1 m a 1 p l a 1 p m a 1 l a p p 2 l a m a 8 using lemma 4 3 we now remove the lower bound a k on n theorem 4 4 for an integer a 1 let l a and m a be as in proposition 4 2 let k be an integer greater than or equal to the quotient l a m a and let n be a positive integer bounded by n a 1 k then the van der waerden complex vdw n k is contractible proof let b a be a positive integer such that b k n b 1 k by lemma 4 3 we have that l b m b l a m a k hence applying proposition 4 2 with the parameter b implies that vdw n k is contractible remark if a 1 is not a prime power then the statement of theorem 4 4 can be sharpened by increasing a by 1 because we have that l a lcm 1 2 a lcm 1 2 a 1 hence in this case we have that the complex vdw n k is contractible for k l a m a and n a 2 k we have the following lower and upper bounds on m a lemma 4 5 for an integer a 1 let m a be defined as in proposition 4 2 then we have that a 4 m a a 2 proof assume that m a p 1 where p is a prime and 0 we have that p a and hence m a p 1 p 2 a 2 as for the lower bound let 0 satisfy 2 a 2 1 then we have a 4 2 1 m a 5 examples for the sake of illustration in this section we discuss the topology of the family of van der waerden complexes vdw 5 k k for k 1 let l a and m a be defined as in proposition 4 2 then l 4 12 22 3 and accordingly m 4 2 applying theorem 4 4 for a 4 we conclude the complex vdw 5 k k is contractible for all k l 4 m 4 6 in fact when k 6 the van der waerden complex vdw n k is contractible for all positive integers n 5 k the remaining van der waerden complexes in the family namely vdw 5 1 through vdw 25 5 are not contractible for instance the complex vdw 5 1 is the complete graph k 5 which is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of 4 2 6 circles to determine the homotopy equivalence of the other four van der waerden complexes we construct on each complex an acyclic matching with a minimal number of critical cells example 5 1 the complex vdw 10 2 has a discrete morse matching with the critical cells 10 and x x 3 for 1 x 7 thus this complex is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of seven circles proof on the face poset of vdw 10 2 match the singleton x with x x 1 for 1 x 9 furthermore match x x 2 d with x x d x 2 d for 1 x x 2 d 10 it is straightforward to see that this matching is acyclic and the critical cells have the form x x 3 for 1 x 7 the homotopy result follows from proposition 2 5 9 vdw 5 k k homotopy type vdw 5 1 s 1 6 vdw 10 2 s 1 7 vdw 15 3 s 2 9 vdw 20 4 s 2 22 vdw 25 5 s 2 32 table 1 the homotopy types for vdw 5 k k such that 1 k 5 by theorem 4 4 the complex vdw 5 k k is contractible for k 6 let q and vdw n k q be the poset and the order preserving map which appear in the beginning of the proof of proposition 4 1 we will use them in examples 5 2 through 5 4 example 5 2 the complex vdw 15 3 has a discrete morse matching with the critical cells 15 and x x 3 x 6 for 1 x 9 hence this complex is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of nine 2 dimensional spheres proof for a non empty face f vdw 15 3 the difference max f min f takes one of the following values 0 1 2 3 4 6 8 9 and 12 consider the following matching 1 if the difference max f min f 0 1 2 4 8 we match the face f in the same manner as in example 5 1 this leaves 15 as a critical cell 2 if 1 x x 3 d n we match the face f in the fiber 1 x x 3 d with the symmetric difference f x d note that when the difference is 6 this leaves the critical cells x x 3 x 6 for 1 x 9 n 6 observe that all of these matchings stay inside the corresponding fiber of the poset map and are acyclic in each fiber hence by theorem 2 3 their union is an acyclic matching the critical cells are 15 and x x 3 x 6 for 1 x 9 it follows from proposition 2 5 that vdw 15 3 is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of nine spheres example 5 3 the complex vdw 20 4 has a discrete morse matching with the critical cells 20 x x 3 x 6 for 1 x 14 and x x 4 x 12 for 1 x 8 hence this complex is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of 22 2 dimensional spheres proof now we have that for a non empty face f vdw 20 4 the difference max f min f 0 1 2 3 4 6 8 9 12 16 1 when max f min f 0 1 2 3 6 9 we match in the same manner as in example 5 2 above this leaves one zero dimensional critical cell 20 and 14 two dimensional critical cells of the form x x 3 x 6 for 1 x 14 2 for 1 x 16 match each face f in the fiber 1 x x 4 with the symmetric difference f x 2 10 3 for 1 x 12 match each face f in the fiber 1 x x 8 with the symmetric difference f x 4 4 for 1 x 8 and f 1 x x 12 there are three cases to consider if f x 6 vdw 20 4 then we match f with the symmetric difference f x 6 the remaining cases are when f is one of the following three faces x x 4 x 12 x x 8 x 12 or x x 4 x 8 x 12 we proceed by matching the last two faces and leaving x x 4 x 12 as a critical face for 1 x 8 5 for 1 x 4 we match each face f 1 x x 16 with the symmetric difference f x 8 the result follows by the same reasoning as the end of example 5 2 example 5 4 the complex vdw 25 5 has a discrete morse matching with the critical cells 25 x x 3 x 6 for 1 x 19 and x x 4 x 12 for 1 x 13 hence this complex is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of 32 2 dimensional spheres proof note that for a non empty face f we have that the difference max f min f belongs to the set 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 9 10 11 12 15 16 20 consider the following matching 1 when the difference max f min f 0 1 2 3 4 6 8 9 12 16 we match as in example 5 3 this leaves the critical cells 25 x x 3 x 6 for 1 x 19 and x x 4 x 12 for 1 x 13 2 for 1 x x 5 d 25 which implies 1 d 4 match the face f 1 x x 5 d with the symmetric difference f x d the same reasoning as in the previous examples yields the result note that since 3 and 5 are prime it was easier to describe the matchings for the complexes vdw 15 3 and vdw 25 5 6 concluding remarks some natural questions arise concerning the topology of the van der waerden complex if vdw n k is noncontractible is it always homotopy equivalent to a wedge of spheres there is some evidence for this in the examples described in section 5 one possible way to prove such a result would be to construct an acyclic matching that satisfies kozlov s alternating path condition 7 when the complex vdw n k is noncontractible can one predict its betti numbers or say some thing nontrivial about their behavior with respect to n or k moreover do sequences of these betti numbers have an underlying connection to other mathematical structures including number theoretic ones what is the error term in the asymptotic bound log k log log k for the dimension of the homotopy type in theorem 3 11 given that the prime number theorem is fundamentally encoded into this asymptotic via the primorial function it is conceivable that a successful analysis in this direction 11 may yield a statement about the homotopy dimension bound of vdw n k that is equivalent to the riemann hypothesis are theorems 3 8 and 4 4 provably the tightest possible general bounds for the dimension with respect to k and for contractibility with respect to n k can one generalize theorem 4 4 to a bound on the dimension of the homotopy type of vdw n k with respect to both n and k as opposed to just k as in theorem 3 8 acknowledgments the authors thank nigel pitt for discussions related to asymptotics in
