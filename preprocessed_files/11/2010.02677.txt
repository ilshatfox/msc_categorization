ing mersenne prime to all base and uniformly for both generalized mersenne and wagstaff numbers the later correspond to negative base the role of the quadratic iteration x x 2 2 is extended by chebyshev polynomial tn x with an implied iteration algorithm because of the compositional iden tity tn tm x tnm x this results from a chebyshev polynomial primal ity test based essentially on the lucas pair a a a a a 2 1 where a 6 0 1 it gives a uniform way to detect primality of all integers of the form p q r q p r p q r for q 6 0 1 and gcd q r 1 which implies for example tqp rp a tq r a mod p q r for any a 6 0 1 the chebyshev test using tn x is a natural extension of the usual fermat test using tn x x n which satisifies the simplest instance of the composition law tn tm tnm to test primality of q the method essentially do a fermat little test in the ring z qz a 2 1 with unit base a the advantage is that when we change the base unit a it also changes the ring which gives more possibility the integers in a quadratic ring has two components and it is more conve nient to work with rational integers by taking trace which is the chebyshev polynomial we further observed that there is a natural generalization of mersenne prime search to multi prime parameters search given by general homogenized cyclotomic with odd square free index n r s this has explicit product form as an example the cyclotomic number 2021 4 13 4 13 42021 132021 443 1343 447 1347 is a 2152 digit prime we also note that chebyshev polynomials tn un have a twisted bosonic version sn vn and they can all be derived as odd and even part of a bionomial 1 x n following a n mo solution on real rootedness of s eulerian polynomial 1 main results and proof the chebyshev polynomial of the first kind can be explicitly defined 9 for x 1 by tn x x x 2 1 n x x 2 1 n 2 nx n x 2 where x x x 2 1 has a natural extension to negative value of n with t n x tn x since 1 in fact we can extend tn x cosh n log x to all real or even complex value of n and also x with the recursion tn 1 x 2 xtn x tn 1 x still holds this also says that for integral a 6 0 1 tn a is half the trace of the nth power of the unit a in q a 2 1 and indeed for all 2000 mathematics subject classification primary 11 a 51 secondary 11 a 15 key words and phrases lucas lehmer chebyshev primality 1 http arxiv org abs 2010 02677 v 2 2 kok seng chua such a a a is a lucas pair in the sense of 1 this seems to suggest that apart from its role in numerical analysis the chebyshev polynomial tn x may also have some interesting arithmetical properties if n is a positive integer we have clearly na pn a qn a a 2 1 for some pn x qn x z x but they are just chebyshev polynomials na a a 2 1 n tn a un 1 a a 2 1 which follows from n 1 a n a a and induction and this is another way to think of tn x un x which also derives the recursion which one can never remember it also suggest a twisted version of chebyshev if we replace a with the negative unit a a 2 1 since a is a unit so is n a and hence we have the pell s equation tn a 2 un 1 a 2 a 2 1 1 it follows that we have also deducible from the elementary identity x t 1 x cosh log x na tn a tn a 2 1 tn a and this implies the compositional multiplicativity tm tn a tmn a this seems to be a remarkable property which is special only to chebyshev and not the other orthogonal polynomials it implies that one can compute tqn a efficiently as t nq a where the power on the right means compositional iteration of the smaller polynomial tq a in particular if we let sn 2 t 2 n 2 then using t 2 x 2 x 1 we get 1 1 s 0 4 sn 1 s 2 n 2 which is exactly lucas lehmer iteration for testing mersenne prime so we have for odd prime p mp 2 p 1 is prime if and only if mp divides 2 t 2 p 2 2 sp 2 it seems that there is no reason for the base 2 to be special for chebyshev and it is natural to wonder if there is a natural test for primality of qp 1 or rather p q q p 1 q 1 dividing out the obvious factor for q 2 using perhaps tqn 2 q mod p q using the implied fast computation a little experimentation testing initial primes p upto 300 led us to visually discover that there is always a dip similar to the dip in light intensity in a well known method for detecting exo planets in the number of digits of the residues tqn a mod p q for a 6 0 1 exactly for primes p where p q is prime but there appears to be two distinct residues checking some examples show a dependence on the quadratic character a 2 1 p q which always equals 1 in the lucas lehmer case where q a 2 since 3 is a qudratic non residue mod any mersenne prime this then allows us to guess the correct statement 1 2 numerically in the theorem below an unexpected addition which we discovered accidentally is that the result still holds when q 6 0 1 is negative in which case it corresponds to primality of generalized wagstaff primes p q qp 1 q 1 with the same algorithm as long as t n x is implemented as tn x it is now easy to deduce the proof of 1 2 from the standard proof of the necessity part of lucas lehmer replacing 2 2 3 with a a a 2 1 once we know we need to keep track of the quadratic character lemma 1 6 in this instance knowing the exact statement of the result which we found numerically lead us to the generalized proof theorem 1 2 is however weaker than the necessity part of lucas lehmer in the case q a 2 which however can be deduced from lemma 1 6 we keep the statement of 1 2 for its simplicity chebyshev polynomials and higher order lucas lehmer algorithm 3 theorem 1 1 let q a be integers both not 0 1 and p be an odd prime and let a 2 1 p q if p q is a prime not dividing a 2 1 then 1 2 tqp a tq 1 a uqp q 1 2 a 0 mod p q more generally if p q r qp rp q r is the homogenized form with gcd q r 1 is prime and a 2 1 p q r then 1 3 tqp rp a tq r a uqp rp q r 1 a 0 mod p q r remark 1 2 this works also for q for example for q 2 a 2 p 3 it says np 2 p 1 3 prime implies t 2 p 2 t 3 p 3 2 mod np which in term of 1 1 is equivalent to np divides sp 104 90 p 3 this is a weakened form and we can derive a stronger version later namely np divides sp 1 5 9 p 3 note also we only need to code one program which will work for both q provided t n x and u n x are implemented as tn x un 2 x as was the case with pari gp which we used remark 1 3 one can compute tqp a efficiently as t p q a but un x does not sat isfies the compositional identity and in general they don t commute un um x 6 um un x for large n of no special form un and also tn can be computed in o log n steps by the usual method of writing a linear recurrence as a matrix power and applied the binary exponentiation as was observed in 3 we give the formula to compute tn 1 a un a mod q together via a coupled recurrence which follows from n 1 n and 2 2 below 1 4 tn 1 a un a a a 2 1 1 a n a 1 mod q if n qp for small one should use q nary expansion of n remark 1 4 one can express 1 2 in a simple lucas lehmer form similar to 1 1 let s 0 a sn 1 tq sn if p q is prime it divides sp 2 tq a 2 1 p q 1 a this is weaker than what is provable but have a simple uniform form sufficiency actually failed in this weak form for some small p for some choices of a eg q 11 p 3 a 2 m 11 11 3 1 10 133 7 19 q 5 p 3 a 3 n 53 1 6 21 3 7 but this can be ruled out if we choose other starting point eg use a q they also failed the stronger chebyshev test remark 1 5 theorem 1 1 can be seen visually if we compute a list of values of tqp a mod p q for primes p up to say 200 there is clearly a dip in the number of digits of the residues when p q is prime and this is how we first saw them theorem 1 follows immediately from the following lemma lemma 1 6 let q be an odd prime and a 6 0 1 a a 2 1 as before and let a 2 1 q 2 a 1 q then 1 5 q 2 mod q 4 kok seng chua or equivalently 1 6 tq 2 a uq 2 1 a 0 mod q and this implies tq 2 a mod q 2 proof we have computing mod q a 1 a 2 1 q a 1 a 2 1 multiplying by a 1 a 2 1 gives 2 2 a 1 2 a 1 a 2 1 q and using a 1 a 2 1 2 2 a 1 gives us note 1 1 2 q 2 2 a 1 q mod q but we have without mod q q 2 tq 2 a uq 2 1 a a 2 1 by 2 2 below which give the equivalent 1 5 remark 1 7 writing n q 2 since is a unit so is n we must have the pell s equation n n tn a 2 a 2 1 un 1 a 2 1 so we have q 2 divides tn a 2 1 tn a tn a since q divides tn a its prime divisor cannot divide tn a so we always have tn a mod q 2 proof proof of theorem specialize to q p q qp 1 q 1 q may be negative in 1 4 gives qp 1 q 1 2 q 1 and raising to the 2 q 1 power this lose information gives qp 1 q 1 1 which is the same as tqp a t q 1 1 a tq 1 a uqp q 1 2 a 0 mod q proof of 1 3 is similar note the t test is independent of remark 1 8 using 1 4 one can find similar divisibility criteria of the same se quence for many class of primes eg q 2 a 2 and sn the usual lucas lehmer sequence 1 1 we have mp 2 p 1 prime implies mp divides sp 2 np 2 p 1 3 prime implies np divides sp 1 5 9 p 3 n 2 mn 3 2 n 1 prime implies mn divides s 3 n 1 3 sn 1 4 n 2 nn 3 2 n 1 prime implies nn divides sn 1 1 sn 1 2 etc the last two follows from setting a 2 t 3 2 n 1 2 t 1 2 and t 3 2 n 1 2 1 remark 1 9 for a cubic example let q 3 a 2 and s 0 2 sn 1 sn 4 s 2 n 3 then mp 3 p 1 2 prime implies it divides sp 26 and np 3 p 1 4 prime implies it divides sp 194 1 p 1 2168 chebyshev polynomials and higher order lucas lehmer algorithm 5 2 chebyshev primality test if q is a prime and a an integer with gcd a 2 1 q 1 by 1 5 we have 2 1 tq 2 a 2 a 1 q uq 2 1 a 0 mod q clearly all odd primes q pass this test to every base a we shall called an odd non prime integer q with gcd q a 2 1 1 which pass this test a chebyshev pseudoprime to the base a it depends only on a mod q but there is no subgroup structure chebyshev pseudoprimes are always squarefree except for some prime squared they are rare and seems rarer than fermat pseudoprimes there are only seven of them to the base 2 upto 20000 23 43 37 73 1032 61 181 5 7 443 97 193 31 607 is there a chebyshev pseudoprime to every base mod q a sierpin ski number 12 is a positive odd integer k such that nn k 2 n 1 is composite for every n 1 k 0 78557 is the smallest known sierpin ski number because every nn k 02 n 1 is divisible by one of 3 5 7 13 19 37 73 it may be possible that nn fail a chebyshev test for every n for some a since nn 1 mod 8 for n 3 we get 1 if we pick a 3 so if s 0 3 sk 1 2 s 2 k 1 and n 2 n k 2 n 1 2 does not divide tk sn 1 1 for every n 3 then k is sierpin ski note nn 1 2 nn 1 it is open if any of the following five numbers 21181 22699 24737 55459 67607 is sierpin ski a chebyshev pseudoprime for the base a is also a weak chebyshev pseudoprime as defined in 7 ie tq a a mod q since the condition on u means q 1 or q and taking trace gives tq a t 1 a a mod q there are composites which pass the weak test for all base a oeis a 175530 but all of them fail the strong chebyshev test for all base from 2 to 10 a square free q which pass the t test will also pass the u test proof we have tq a 1 so that q 2 q 2 2 0 and squarefreeness of q implies u q 2 1 a 0 there are many non square free integers which pass the t test but the only non squarefree integer which can pass both tests are square of prime proof so the second part only serve to rule out non squarefree integer and this is relevant since there is no known efficient algorithm to detect squarefreeness however we can always rule out perfect square as input if q 2 2 tq 1 is even we can look at the profile tq 1 a t 2 q 1 a t q 2 a as in the strong pseudoprime test since t 2 x 2 x 2 1 if there is a 1 not preceded by 1 or a 1 not preceded by 0 q cannot be prime for the seven pseudoprimes above the profiles are 1 0 1 9083 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 8416 4431 8861 1 14063 17370 18527 387 1 18791 1301 18720 0 1 1 so the strong test rule out 5 7 443 and 97 193 as primes for square free q 1 is always preceded by 0 since m m 2 1 implies m 2 m 2 2 0 mod q we note that for a 6 0 1 a a forms a lucas pair in the sense of 1 since a a is not a root of unity the associated lucas number un a a un 1 a it seems to follow from 1 that for every n 1 un a has a primitive divisor ie there is a prime p which divides un a but not a a 2 1 u 0 a un 1 a 6 kok seng chua 2 1 multiplicative order and sufficiency test many of the necessity criteria seems to be sufficient in the range we can compute it could be that when q is composite the residue behave randomly and the chance they give divisibility is 1 q which is very small so we never see them let a a 2 1 be the canonical unit for an integer power n we must have n p a q a a 2 1 for some p x q x z x but for they are just chebyshev polynomials 9 or just by induction 2 2 n tn a un 1 a a 2 1 and n may be negative writing n 1 n gives the recurrence formula in 1 3 for an odd integer q let oq be the multiplicative order of a mod q ie the smallest integer m such that m 1 mod q this is thus the same as the smallest integer m such that tm a 1 and um 1 a 0 mod q note that for a prime q or a chebyshev pseudoprime q we have q a 2 1 so that oq a divides one of q 1 in particular it divides q 2 1 and oq q 1 there seems to be only one argument to prove primality of q one shows that has multiplicative order q 1 and hence q cannot have any non trivial divisor since it will have the same order in fp a 2 1 for the smallest prime p dividing q of size t 2 q 1 we can determine the order if we know the complete factorization of q 1 lemma 2 1 let q be an odd integer and a 6 0 1 and assume 2 a 1 q 1 let a 2 1 q if q is prime then t q 2 a 1 and u q 2 1 a 0 conversely if we know the complete factorization q k j 0 q nj j j 0 k where q 0 2 and we have t q 2 a 1 and u q 2 1 a 0 and also t q qj a 6 1 or u q 2 1 a 6 0 for j 1 k then q is prime for q 2 p 1 and a 2 we get 2 p 1 1 so that oq 2 2 p q 1 so 2 p 1 is prime if and only if o 2 2 q 1 if an only if t 2 p 1 2 1 and this is equivalent to t 2 p 2 2 0 mod q instead of starting with a 2 we can choose any a of the form a 1 x 2 so that a 1 3 y 2 or a 1 6 y 2 we then have 1 we still have 2 p 1 is prime if and only if t 2 p 2 a 0 mod q this condition turns out to be necessary and sufficient and is given in oeis a 18844 lemma 2 1 is just the analogue of the usual computational definition of the existence of a primitive root in the case of z q but there is one basic difference here since changing base a means changing the group z a 2 1 also we can change a until we get the correct order example 2 2 let a 2 and r r 1 rk be an odd square free integer not divisible by 3 and let 2 r 0 1 mod 3 n 2 n and q r 2 n 1 let s 0 2 sn 1 s 2 n 2 then q is prime implies q divides tr sn 2 2 conversely if q is odd integer of the form r 2 n 1 and divides tr sn 2 2 and in addition t r rj sn 2 6 1 mod q for j 1 k then q is prime proof the value of were chosen such that q 1 mod 3 so for a 2 1 and 2 a 1 q 1 and we have q 2 r 2 n 1 1 so that tr 2 n 2 2 0 it also implies the order oq t 1 tk 2 n where tj divides rj if t r rj sn 2 6 1 r rj 2 n 6 1 we must have tj rj and om m 1 chebyshev polynomials and higher order lucas lehmer algorithm 7 if we let r 5 then for n up to 3000 there are 29 primes and 5 of them at n 2 18 32 1638 2622 fail the sufficiency tests we also have an order q version example 2 3 let q 12 qn 1 be prime where q is an odd prime then t 3 qn 2 0 mod q conversely if an odd integer q is of the form 12 qn 1 satisfies t 3 qn 2 0 and in addition t 4 qn 2 t 12 qn 1 2 are all not 1 mod q then q is prime proof we have q 1 mod 3 and 5 mod 8 so if a 2 1 1 so that we have 6 q n 1 so t 3 qn 2 0 and oq 4 3 t 1 qt 2 t 1 1 t 2 n it is 12 qn q 1 iff t 12 qn 1 2 6 1 and t 4 qn 2 6 1 for q 5 q is prime when n 1 1 1 5 7 18 19 23 46 51 55 69 1 126 1 469 1835 1 3079 3249 4599 4789 but the primality proof failed for 1 69 126 1835 but we get a proof when we change base recall that a proth s number n k 2 n 1 where k is odd and k 2 n is prime if and only if there ia an integer a such that a n 1 2 1 mod n we have an exact analogue lemma 2 4 let n k 2 n 1 where k is odd and k 2 n let a be such that 1 then n is prime if and only if it pass the chebyshev test ie n 1 2 a 1 or equivalently tk 2 n 1 a 1 uk 2 n 1 1 a 0 mod n proof the necessity is just chebyshev test conversely n 2 k 2 n 1 1 mod n implies the same mod any prime p dividing n which implies p 1 op 2 n which means every prime divisor of n is greater than n a special case of this is a question in mathoverflow 5 where we set a 4 see also answer by ian algol the requirement 1 translate to 5 n 1 and n 3 1 n 1 2 1 since n 1 mod 8 for n 2 and note that pn x 2 tn x 2 for any fixed k and n there is always some choice of a to give a necessary and sufficient condition what we want is for a fixed k to find an a which works for all n but for k 3 this does not seem to be possible example 2 5 in the same way if n 1 and fn 2 2 n 1 and set a 4 we have 1 so 22 n 1 4 1 so that ofn 4 22 n fn 1 and also 2 2 n 2 4 22 n 2 4 0 so fn is prime if and only if t 22 n 2 4 0 mod fn in lucas lehmer term if s 0 8 sn 1 s 2 n 2 then fn is prime if and only if fn divides s 2 n 2 3 chebyshev polynomials are just even and odd part of binomials 3 1 twisting chebyshev polynomials the chebyshev test depends on the unit a a 2 1 it is natural to wonder if we get something new using the negative units a a 2 1 instead if we let x x x 2 1 we will have x x 1 if we define the polynomial nx sn x vn 1 x x 2 1 we have s 1 x x v 0 x 1 and sn 1 x xsn x x 2 1 vn 1 x vn x sn x xvn 1 x 8 kok seng chua or 3 1 sn 1 a vn a a a 2 1 1 a n a 1 again sn x nx n x 2 sn x is the same as tn x with all coefficients positive and vn is un with all sign positive so they are congruent mod 2 roots of sn vn are i times those of tn un which follows from sn x i ntn x i vn x i nun x i we also have the finite golden ratio x 1 x 1 x x 1 x vn x 2 vn 1 x 2 gan 1 x which is the hyperbolic version of x 1 x 1 x x 1 x un x 2 un 1 x 2 fan 1 x which converge to x x 2 4 2 which are positive branch to the inverse of the simplest quadratic f x x 1 x here fan 1 x det xi an det xi an 1 gan 1 x per xi an per xi an 1 are cauchy interlacing ratio for the path graph on n vertices to that with one end point deleted also we have the pell s equation s 2 n x v 2 n 1 x x 2 1 1 n so that nx sn x sn x 2 1 n so that nx sn x for odd n and sm sn x smn x for n odd note s 3 s 2 x 32 x 6 48 x 4 30 x 2 7 6 s 6 x 32 x 6 48 x 4 18 x 2 1 s 2 s 3 x we still have compositional commutativity sn sm sm sn for m n both odd is there a primality test based on iterating this 3 2 square root of even and odd part of chebyshev polynomials s eulerian and erhart polynomials the polynomial pn x 1 n 2 x n 4 x 2 n 6 x 3 n 8 x 4 n 2 n 2 x n 2 is an s eulerian polynomial and is known to be real rooted since degree pn n 2 we expect pn to interlace pn 2 which was supported by computations a problem posted in mo luis ferroni asked to prove that the polynomial qn x pn x nx which is the ehrhart h polynomial of the hypersimplex 2 n is also real rooted this was solved explicitly by fedor petrov who observe that 2 pn x 1 i x n 1 i x n chebyshev polynomials and higher order lucas lehmer algorithm 9 if we expand 2 p 1 x 2 pn 1 x we get the recursion pn x 2 pn 1 x x 1 pn 2 x so that we have a continued fraction pn x pn 1 x 2 x 1 pn 1 x pn 2 x 2 x 1 2 x 1 2 x 1 x 1 which gives a fast way to compute pn x we also have by expanding 2 p 2 x 2 pn 2 x pn x 2 1 x pn 2 x 1 x 2 pn 4 x which gives pn x pn 2 x 2 1 x 1 x 2 pn 2 x pn 4 x 2 1 x 1 x 2 2 1 x 1 x 2 2 1 x 1 x 2 x 1 which allow us to prove interlacing inductively by looking at the graphs it is obvious from the mo solution that pn is essentially a squareroot of cheby shev tn x x npn x 2 1 x 2 so we know their roots explicitly from those of tn and they are given by tan k 1 2 n 2 k 0 n 2 1 3 2 1 deriving chebyshev polynomilas from the binomial 1 x n we let 1 i x n pn x iqn x x so that qn x n 2 1 j 0 n 2 j 1 xj pn x n 2 j 0 n 2 j xj 2 pn x 1 i x n 1 i x n 2 iqn x x 1 i x n 1 i x n the tangent substitution x 1 y 2 y 2 gives tn y y npn y 2 1 y 2 un 1 y y n 1 qn y 2 1 y 2 since x x 2 1 n tn x un 1 x x 2 1 and we also have the dual x x 2 1 n sn x vn 1 x x 2 1 the hyperbolic tangent substitution x 1 y 2 y 2 gives sn y y npn y 2 1 y 2 vn y y n 1 qn y 2 1 y 2 10 kok seng chua multiplying 1 i x n with 1 i x n gives 1 x n pn x 2 xqn x 2 this does not look obvious and it implies a series of binomial identities obviously we also have 1 x n n 2 j 0 n 2 j x 2 j x n 1 2 j 0 n 2 j 1 x 2 j pn x 2 xqn x 2 which give the functional equation pn x 2 xqn x 2 pn x 2 xqn x 2 but note pn x 2 6 pn x 2 are there other such pairs of polynomials so the chebyshev polynomials tn un are essentially just the even and odd part of the binomial polynomial 1 x n 3 3 aside extending mersenne primes search to cyclotomic primes the mersenne prime mp 2 p 1 can be expressed as mp p 2 where m x denotes the mth cyclotomic polynomial it is natural and seemingly useful to gen eralize the mersenne prime to more general cyclotomic primes let m x y m x y y m be the homogenized cyclotomic polynomial since m x are irre ducible with fixed divisor 1 m 1 1 except p 1 p 2 1 p there should be infinitely many primes of the form m r s as r s varies by schinzel s conjecture one expects some form of uniform distribution so that we still get infinitely many primes if we fixed r s with s r and gcd r s 1 and varies m for example one can widen the difficult question for the infinitute of mersenne primes to those of the form m 2 1 note not the same as 2 m 1 and more generally are there always infinitely many primes of the form m r s for foxed s r gcd r s 1 the mersenne prime search also generalize naturally to multi prime tuple search for primes of the form p 1 pk r s over distinct odd primes p 1 pk non squarefee m with m r s prime are rare and only occurs when m p 2 and 2 m x m x for m odd we have found a 2152 digit prime 2021 4 13 mersenne numbers are interesting partly because they have a simple form p r s rp sp r s and this generalizes to m r s d m r d sd n d which follows from xm 1 d m d x by inclusion exclusion so we can express the above prime in nicer form 2021 4 13 4 13 42021 132021 443 1343 447 1347 we also found a three tuple 5599 digit example 13 17 29 11 4 116409 46409 1113 413 1117 417 1129 429 11 4 11221 4221 11377 4377 11493 4493 for day we found 79 89 3 14 3 14 379 89 1479 89 379 1479 389 1489 which is a 7868 digit prime this seems to be very useful for outreach purpose to impress the even educated public perhaps more impressive than mersenne primes it is not at all obvious that the rhs is even an integer and it may seem mysterious that the it will somehow cancel out and left with a single term which is a prime however we do not have a simple sufficiency test like lucas lehmer for mersenne prime chebyshev polynomials and higher order lucas lehmer algorithm 11 the product formula for example for k 2 p q r s rp q sp q r s rp sp rq sq means we are searching along prime exponents which does not seem to be governed by the usual conjectures it does not seem easy to even prove that there is at least one such prime for fixed r s with gcd r s 1 maybe the only way is to prove positive density but they seem very sparse acknowledgements this works started when we read some posting on mathoverflow of user pedja terzic and realized that the function he defined is essentially chebyshev polynomial tn x and that the compositional identity tn tm x tnm x means there is an implied q nary lucas lehmer iteration algorithm numerical experimentation then lead us to the statement of theorem 1 1 the q nary lucas lehmer is essentially known in many posting by pedja terzic 5 6 and these can all be derived from our main lemma 1 6
