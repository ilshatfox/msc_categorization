the iwasawa theory over q has a natural place in the context of the galois representation of galpq qq on the etale pro p fundamental group of the projective line minus three points however we still need to assume the vandiver conjecture to get a proof of the main conjecture in this context 1 introduction let us fix an odd prime number p let mp resp mp be the maximal abelian pro p extension of qp p 8 q resp qp p 8 q unramified outside p let us denote x 8 galpmp qp p 8 q q and g galpqp p 8 q qq the group g acts on x 8 by conjugation and hence x 8 is a zprrgss module by a well known theorem of iwasawax 8 is a finitely generated torsion zprrgss module the structure theorem of finitely generated torsion zprrgss modules then implies that x 8 is pseudo isomorphic to izprrgss pfiq for some fi p zprrgss the main conjecture of iwasawa theory proved by mazur wiles 10 and independently by rubin appendix in 9 states that p fiq q p ipzprrgssq where ipzprrgssq is the augmentation ideal and q p p fracpzprrgssq is the p adic zeta function of kubota leopoldt for a more detailed description the reader should consult 1 pages 1 8 let lp be the maximal pro p abelian extension of qp p 8 q unramified everywhere then lp is contained in mp let galpqp p 8 q qq z p the group acts on galplp qp p 8 qq by conjugation the main conjecture can also be stated in terms of the zprr ss module galplp qp p 8 qq see 1 the beginning of section 1 4 and 13 chapter 14 section 14 5 in this note we present a proof of the main conjecture for galplp qp p 8 qq assuming the vandiver conjecture for a prime p we remark that it was already observed by iwasawa that the main conjecture is a consequence of vandiver s conjecture we place our proof in the context of the natural representation of galpq qq on the pro p etale fundamental group of p 1 q t 0 1 8 u based at the tangential point 10 where the main conjecture over q has perhaps its natural place we point out that the 1 http arxiv org abs 1812 04360 v 1 2 mahesh kakde zdzis law wojtkowiak december 12 2018 p adic zeta function of kubota leopoldt appears naturally while considering this galois representation see 16 our proof is based on construction of the cocycle ap 10 q gq zprrzpss defined in 16 and denoted there by p whose construction will be given in section 2 and on the ihara s formula z p xm 1 dap 10 qprclsp qqpxq lppm 1 mqp 1 pm 1 qcwmp q for m 1 and odd see 7 formula on the page 105 let us explain briefly the notations and objects appearing in the formula let u 18 be the projective limit with respect to the relative norm maps of the principal units of qpp pnq let kp be the field extension of qp p 8 q generated by all p powers roots of 1 i pn for all n and all 0 i pn in the formula p u 18 rcls u 1 8 galpkp qp p 8 q is induced from the local class field theory maps cwn u 1 8 zp are coates wiles homomorphisms lp is the p adic l function of kubota leopoldt and is the teichmu ller character our principal result is the following consequence of the ihara s formula proposition 1 1 let p u 18 then ap 10 q prclsp qq p pf q as pseudo measures on z p using the well known isomorphism between the ring of mea sures on z p and the ring of zprrz p ss we may consider the above equation as an equality in the total ring of fractions of zprrz p ss in the last formula f is the coleman power series associated to the power series pf q is defined by p pf qqpt q p 1 t qf 1 pt q f pt q further g denotes the measure on zp associated to a power series gpt q p zprrt ss and g denotes the restriction of the measure on zp to z p again we have implicitly used isomorphisms between the ring of zp values measures on zp the ring zprrzpss and the ring zprrt ss the latter obtained by fixing 1 p zp as its topological generator the element p is the p adic zeta function we shall construct in this paper corollary 1 2 let ap 10 q galpkp qp p 8 qq zprrz p ss be induced by ap 10 q gq zprrzpss by restriction of a measure on zp to z p then we have an isomorphism of zprr ss modules galpkp kp x lpq p pq where p pq is the augmentation ideal of zprrz p ss times p the action of zprr ss on zprrz p ss will be defined in section 2 in particular the action of 1 p is an involution hence any zprr ss module is a direct sum of the and parts 3 lemma 1 3 let us assume the vandiver conjecture then the map ap 10 q galpkp qp p 8 qq zprrz p ss is an isomorphism this consequence of the vandiver conjecture is in fact well known see 7 section ii theorem 6 2 theorem 7 33 5 theorem c and 6 corollary on page 62 the proofs there use the ihara power series from 7 the proof presented in this note is simpler and moreover it can be applied in more situations for example to study surjectivity of soule classes for roots of unity or more generally of l adic galois polylogarithms introduced in 14 though in fact it has some common points with the alternative proof given on page 333 in 5 the proof of the main conjecture over q is then an easy consequence of corollary 1 2 and lemma 1 3 our last result is the generalization of the ihara s formula for all integers m the case m 1 is the most interesting as then the residue at 1 of the p adic zeta function appears 2 the cocycle associated to the path from 01 to 10 let vn p 1 q zpt 0 8 uy pnq and let n be a path on vn from 01 to 1 pn 10 along the interval r 0 1 s let 1 pvn 01 q denote the e tale pro p fundamental group of vn based at 01 we denote by xn and by yk n for 0 k p n the standard topological generators of 1 pvn 01 q loops around 0 and kpn for 0 k p n respectively see 15 section 1 let p gq

tapnqp 10 qp q z pnz zp i pnqi p qunpn defines a measure denoted ap 10 qp q on zp with values in zp it follows from the proposition that we get a continuous function ap 10 q gq zprrzpss let p gq it follows from the identity 1 n pp qp nqq p 1 n p nqq p 1 n p nqq that 1 pnq i p q pnq i p q p q pnq 1 p qi p q from the last two identities we get 2 pnq i p 1 q pnq i p q p q pnq 1 p qi p q p q pnq 1 p qi p q this identity 2 motivates the next definition 4 mahesh kakde zdzis law wojtkowiak december 12 2018 definition 2 2 define the action of z p hence the action of gq via the p cyclotomic character on zprrzpss by the formula 3 cp m i 1 airxisq m i 1 caircxis for elements of zprzps and we extend by continuity to the action on zprrzpss it follows immediately from the identity 1 that the function ap 10 q gq zprrzpss is a cocycle let a belong to a number field k contained in q we denote by paq gkp p 8 q zp the kummer character associated to a proposition 2 3 see proposition 2 in 16 let p gqp p

p extension of qp p 8 q let p galpqp p 8 q qq and be a lifting of to galpkp qq the group galpqp p 8 q qq z p acts on galpkp qp p 8 qq by the standard formula p q 1 it follows from proposition 2 3 that the map ap 10 q gq zprrzpss factors through the galois group galpkp qq we denote the restriction of ap 10 q galpkp qq zprrzpss to the subgroup galpkp qp p 8 qq also by ap 10 q proposition 2 4 the map ap 10 q galpkp qp p 8 qq zprrzpss is a continuous injective homomorphism of zprr ss modules proof the formula 1 implies that ap 10 q is a morphism of zp modules it follows from equation 2 that that for p gqp p 8 q we have pnq i p 1 q p q pnq 1 p qi p q therefore pn 1 i 0 pnq i p 1 qris pn 1 i 0 p q pnq p q 1 i p qris p q pn 1 j 0 pnq j p qr p qjs 5 hence it follows that ap 10 q is a map the injectivity following from the definition of the field kp and the explicit description of ap 10 q given in proposition 2 3 3 the restriction to z p the multiplicative group z p is a closed and open subset of zp it follows from the formula in equation 3 that the restriction map r zprrzpss zprrz p ss which associates to a measure on zp its restriction to z p is a morphism of zprr ss modules we shall also denote the measurerp q by for p galpq qp p 8 qq we denote the restriction of the measure ap 10 qp q to z p by ap 10 q p q we denote the composition zp galpkp qp p 8 qq ap 10 q zprrzpss r zprrz p ss by zp the action of 1 p is an involution hence galpkp qp p 8 qq and zprrz p ss are the direct sums of their and parts moreover zp induces morphism of zprr ss modules z p galpkp qp p 8 qq zprrz p ss for p t u proposition 3 1 see also 16 corollary 1 we have i the morphisms zp and z p are injective ii the group galpkp qp p 8 qq 0 proof observe that p 1 ipnq for 0 i p n and pi pq 1 as well as p 1 pn q can be expressed as sums of p 1 kpnq with 0 k p n and pk pq 1 hence it follows from propositions 2 3 and 2 4 that zp is injective let a p pn 1 i 0 a pnq i risqnpn p zprrzpss then p 1 q p acts on a as follows p 1 qa a pnq 0 r 0 s pn 1 i 1 a rns i rp n is npn hence it follows that 4 a 1 2 pn 1 i 1 pa pnq i a pnq pn iqris npn and 5 a 1 2 2 a pnq 0 r 0 s pn 1 i 1 pa pnq i a pnq pn iqris npn for p galpkp qp p 8 qq we have ap 10 qp q 1 pn p qr 0 s pn 1 i 1 p 1 ipn qp qrisq npn 6 mahesh kakde zdzis law wojtkowiak december 12 2018 by proposition 2 3 the identity 1 ipn p i pn qp 1 i pnq implies that p 1 i pn q p 1 i pnq on galpkp qp p 8 qq hence it follows that for p galpkp qp p 8 qq we have ap 10 qp q 0 and ap 10 qp q p 1 pn qp qr 0 s pn 1 i 1 p 1 ipnqp qris npn therefore galpkp qp p 8 qq 0 and the map z p given by z p p q pn 1 i 1 pi pq 1 p 1 ipnqp qris npn is injective let en be the group of p units in qp pnq i e en zr pns 1 p and let cn be the group of cyclotomic p units of qp pnq i e the subgroup of en generated by pn and elements 1 kpn for 0 k p n let sn be a set of all integers between 0 and p n 2 that are coprime to p lemma 3 2 the following conditions are equivalent i the map n galpkp qp pnqq ipsnz p n z given by p p 1 ipnqp qqipsn is surjective ii p does not divide en cn proof the map en e pn n qp pnq qp pnq p n induced by the inclusion en qp pnq is injective therefore by the kummer theory the map n is surjective if and only if the subgroup of en e pn n generated by elements 1 i pn i p sn is isomorphic to pz p nzq sn it follows from 13 theorem 8 9 that there is no multiplicative relation between pn and the elements 1 i pn for i p sn hence n is surjective if and only if the subgroup of en e pn n generated by elements 1 i pn i p sn and by pn is isomorphic to pz p nzq sn 1 the last condition holds if and only if the subgroup of en e p n generated by elements 1 i pn i p sn and by pn is isomorphic to pz pzq sn 1 if p divides en cn then there is u p en such that u p p cn but u r cn any element of cn can be written in a unique way in the form a 0 pn ipsn p 1 ipnq ai see 13 theorem 8 9 hence up a 0 pn ipsn p 1 ipnq ai where at least one of ai 0 modulo p but then the subgroup of en e p n generated by pn and 1 ipn for i p sn will have the rank smaller than sn 1 therefore i implies ii 7 if p does not divide en cn then the map cn c p n en e p n is injective the elements pn and 1 i pn for i p sn taken modulo c p n form a basis of cn c p n but it implies going backwards all equivalent statements that i holds lemma 3 3 the following conditions are equivalent i the map z p galpkp qp p 8 qq galpkp qp p 8 qq zprrz p ss is an isomorphism of zprr ss modules ii p does not divide en cn for all n 1 proof if p does not divide en cn then the map n galpkp qp pnqq ipsnz p n z given by p p 1 ipnqp qqipsn is surjective by lemma 3 2 let m n let us assume that p does not divide em cm then it follows from the bass theorem see 13 page 150 and theorem 8 9 that the map pmqn galpkp qp pmqq ipsnz p m z given by p p 1 ipnqp qqipsn is surjective hence the assumption ii implies that for all n p n the maps 8 n galpkp qp p 8 qq ipsnzp given by p p 1 ipnqp qqipsn are surjective therefore the map z p galpkp qp p 8 qq zprrz p ss is surjective hence it follows from proposition 3 1 that the map z p is an isomorphism it follows from lemma 3 2 that i implies ii 4 the multiplicative structure of zprrz p ss we denote by zppkq the ring zp equipped with the action of given by xpaq xka the infinite product 8 k 1 zppkq is equipped with a multiplicative structure given by pakq 8 k 1 pbkq 8 k 1 pakbkq 8 k 1 the zprr ss module zprrz p ss has a multiplication induced by a group multiplication in z p let us define a map zprrz p ss 8 k 1 zppkq 8 mahesh

it is evident that is continuous let us first show that the map is a map of zprr ss by continuity of the it is enough to check that pg q g p q for each g p and for xpz p axrxs p zprz p s by our

lemma 4 1 that the composition galpkp qp p 8 qq z p zprrz p ss 8 k 1 zpp 2 k 1 q is an injective morphism of zprr ss modules 9 5 the coates wiles homomorphism we recall briefly some results of coleman presented in 1 let un zpr pn 1 s and put u 8 lim n un with the projective limit taken with respect to the norm maps let n zprrt ss zprrt ss be the norm map defined in 1 put w tf p zprrt ss n pfq fu for each integer n 0 we fix a pn 1 root pn 1 of 1 such that p pn 1 pn theorem 5 1 see 1 theorem 2 1 2 and corollary 2 3 7 let p nq p u 8 then there exists a unique f pt q p zprrt ss such that fp pn 1 1 q n for all n 0 moreover the map f pt q defines an isomorphism of groups from u 8 to w let us define zprrt ss zprrt ss by pfq p 1 t qf 1 pt q fpt q for f p zprrt ss we define pfqpt q fpp 1 t qp 1 q the trace operator zprrt ss zprrt ss is a continuous zp homomorphism characterized by the identity p qpfqpt q 1 p p p 1 fp p 1 t q 1 q we set zprrt ss id tf p zprrt ss pfq fu we define a map rcols u 8 zprrt ss to be the map pf pt qq corollary 5 2 the map rcols induces a surjective homomorphism of zprr ss modules rcols u 8 zprrt ss id with kerprcolsq p 1 proof it follows from 1 theorem 2 4 6 and lemma 2 4 5 that rcols is surjective with kerprcolsq p 1 we recall that the action of on zprrt ss is defined by cpfq cfpp 1 t q c 1 q the map f pt q commutes with the action of c p defined by cpfq fpp 1 t q c 1 q hence when we compose with we get that rcols is a map the map rcols is a morphism of z modules hence by continuity it is a zp whence a map of zpr s modules we recall the definition of the

lemma 2 6 2 10 mahesh kakde zdzis law wojtkowiak december 12 2018 we recall that p zprrzpss zprrt ss is the iwasawa isomorphism characterized by ppr 1 sq p 1 t q and that in our notation if f p zprrt

and the result follows we denote by en and cn the group of units and cyclotomic units respectively in qp pnq let qp pnq be the maximal real subfield of qp pnq we denote by e n and c n the group of units and cyclotomic units in qp pnq and by e n and c n the group of p units and cyclotomic p units in qp pnq lemma 6 2 the inclusions en en and e n e n induce isomorphisms en cn en cn and e n c n e n c n proposition 6 3 let us assume that p does not divide the class number hpqp pq q i e that the vandiver conjecture holds for a prime p then p does not divide en cn for all n 1 proof the vandiver

and corollary 4 13 and cn pnc n 13 lemma 8 1 hence it follows that e n c n en cn therefore it follows from the above lemma that p does not divide the order of en cn for all n 1 12 mahesh kakde zdzis

galpmp qp p 8 qq galpkp qp p 8 qq by rcls the image of rcls is the subgroup galpkp k 0 pq of galpkp qp p 8 qq the next result we need is stated without proof in 8 on page 248 lemma 6 4 let us assume that p does not divide the class number hpqp pq q i e that the vandiver conjecture holds for a prime p then kp m p proof it follows from proposition 3 1 ii that kp m p another proof is in 8 on page 248 first we shall show that m p is generated over qp p 8 q by p nth rootsqp pnq of p units of qp p 8 q for n p n the extension qp p 8 q m p is pro p abelian hence it is generated by kummer extensions of the form qp pnq m qp pnqpa 1 prq for some a p zr pns we can assume that a p zr pns let q be a prime ideal of zr pns not dividing p if a r q then the extension qp pnq m is unramified over q let us assume that a p q then the extension m of qp pnq is unramified over q if and only if a p qkp r for some k 0 and a r qkp r 1 if q is a principal ideal generated by q p zr pns then a qkp r a 1 a 1 r q and m qp pnqpa 1 pr 1 q so let us assume that q is not a principal ideal the fact that p does not divide hpqp pq q implies that p does not divide hpqp pnq q see 13 corollary 10 6 hence there is a positive integer s coprime to p such that qs is a principal ideal generated by some q p zr pns observe that as qkp r a 1 a 1 r q and qp pnqpa 1 pr 1 q m by the kummer theory therefore m p is generated over qp p 8 q by p units of qp pnq for n p n it follows form 13 corollary 10 6 and theorem 8 2 and from lemma 6 2 that p does not qp pnq divide e n c n hence it follows from the kummer theory that m p is generated over qp p 8 q by cyclotomic p units of qp pnq for n p n the elements 1 ipn for i between 0 and pn 2 and coprime to p and pn generate p units of qp pnq the p units of qp pnq can be
