residue characteristic p g a connected reductive group over f and r a field of characteristic p when r is algebraically closed the irreducible admissible r representations of g g f are classified in ahhv in term of supersingular r representations of the levi subgroups of g and parabolic induction there is a similar classification for the simple modules of the pro p iwahori hecke r algebra h g r in abe in this paper we show that both classifications hold true when r is not algebraically closed contents i introduction 1 ii some general algebra 7 iii classification theorem for g 12 iv classification theorem for h g 18 v applications 25 vi appendix eight inductions modr h m modr h g 29 references 31 i introduction i 1 in this paper p is a prime number f is a locally compact non archimedean field of residual characteristic p g is a connected reductive group over f finally r is a field in this introduction r has characteristic p except in i 2 recent applications of automorphic forms to number theory have imposed the study of smooth representations of g g f on r vector spaces indeed one expects a strong relation a la langlands with r representations of the galois group of f the only established case however is that of gl 2 qp the first focus is on irreducible representations when r is an algebraically closed the irreducible admissible r representations of g have been classified in terms of parabolic induction of supersingular r representations of levi subgroups of g ahhv but the restriction to algebraically closed r is undesirable for example in the work of breuil and colmez on gl 2 qp r is often finite here we extend to any r the classification of ahhv and its consequences let i be a pro p iwahori subgroup of g if w is a smooth r representation of g the fixed point w i is a right module over the hecke ring h g of i in g it is non zero if w is and finite dimensional if w is admissible even though w i might not be simple over h g when w is irreducible it is important to study simple r h g modules when 1 http arxiv org abs 1712 08038 v 1 2 g henniart and m f vigne ras r is algebraically closed they have been classified abe see also ahenv 2 cor 4 30 in terms of supersingular r h m modules where m is a levi subgroup of g and h m the hecke ring of i m in m the classification uses a parabolic induction process from h m modules to h g modules again we extend that classification to any r i 2 before we state our main results more precisely let us describe our principal tool for reducing them to the known case where r is algebraically closed those tools are developped in section ii the idea is to introduce an algebraic closure ralg of r and study the scalar extension w 7 ralg r w from r representations of g to r alg representations of g or from r h g modules to ralg h g modules the important remark is that when w is an irreducible admissible r representation of g or a simple r h g module its commutant has finite dimension over r the following result examines what happens for more general extensions r of r theorem 1 decomposition theorem let r be a field a an r algebra 1 and v a simple a module with commutant d enda v of finite dimension over r let e denote the center of the skew field d the reduced degree of d over e and esep the maximal separable extension of r contained in e let r be a normal extension of r containing a finite separable extension of e splitting d then the scalar extension vr of v to r has length e r and is a direct sum vr j homr esep r vr j of copies of a direct sum of esep r indecomposable ar modules vr j of commutant the local artinian ring r j esep e for each j vr j has length e esep simple subquotients all isomorphic to r r esepe vr j of commutant r and descends to a finite extension of r the vr j are not isomorphic to each other and form a single autr r orbit the map sending v to the autr r orbit of r r esepe vr j induces a bijection from the set of isomorphism classes v of simple a modules v with commutant of finite dimension over r resp v of finite dimension over r to the set of autr r orbits of the isomorphism classes v of simple ar modules v with commutant of finite dimension over r descending to a finite extension of r resp v of finite dimension over r thm 1 implies without difficulty corollary 1 for any extension l r the length of vl is e r and the dimension over l of the commutant of any subquotient of vl is finite the second theorem is a criterion inspired by ahenv 1 lemma 3 11 for a functor to preserve the lattice lw of submodules of a module w theorem 2 lattice isomorphism let f c d be a functor between abelian categories of right adjoint g unit id g f and counit f g id then f and g induce lattice isomorphisms inverse from each other between lw and lf w for any object w c of finite length satisfying the properties a the unit morphism w w g f w is an isomorphism 1 all our algebras are associative with unit representations of a p adic group in characteristic p 3 b f y 1 f y 2 for any subobjects y 1 y 2 of w or g x 6 0 for any non zero subobject x of f w c f y is simple for any simple object y subquotient of w equivalent to the properties a b c where b g x is simple for any simple subquotient x of f w c the length of f w is equal to the length of w if w satisfies a b c then any subquotient of w satisfies a b and c the proof starts by showing that f defines an injective lattice map lw lf w using a and b and then showing that the lattice map lf w l g f w defined by g is injective using c we end ii by another lattice isomorphism for the functor rv from r vector spaces to a modules where v is a simple a module with commutant r inspired by abe lemma 5 3 theorem 3 lattice isomorphism and tensor product let r be a field a an r algebra v a simple a module with commutant r and w an r vector space then w r v is an isotypical a module of type v the map y 7 y r v lw lw rv is a lattice isomorphism the map w homa v w rv sending w w to w v 7 w v is an isomorphism let moreover bw endr w bv endr v and a subspace y of w if y is stable by bw then y r v is stable by bw bv conversely if y r v is stable by bw bv then y is stable by bw provided that bv 6 0 in our applications we have an r algebra a containing a and an a module v which is simple with commutant r as an a module we also have a basis b of a containing a basis b of a and elements of b b act invertibly on v moreover we deal with a modules w where elements of b act as identity and such that the tensor product action of b on w r v yields an a module corollary 2 in the above situation the map y 7 y r v lw lw rv yields a lattice isomorphisms between a submodules of w and a submodules of w r v the map w homa v w r v is an isomorphism of a modules if we let b b act on homa v w r v by b bw rv b 1 v note that the natural map homa v w r v r v w r v is also an isomorphism of a modules if we let b b act by the tensor product action i 3 in iii for a field r of characteristic p we prove the classification of the irreducible admissible r representations of g in terms of supersingular irreducible admissible r representations of levi subgroups of g an r triple p q of g consists of a parabolic subgroup p mn of g a smooth r representation of m and a parabolic subgroup q of g satisfying p q p where p m n is the maximal parabolic subgroup of g where extends trivially on 4 g henniart and m f vigne ras n let eq denote the restriction to mq of this extension by definition ig p q ind g p st m q where 3 1 st m q ind m q eq q q p ind m q eq 3 2 is the generalized steinberg r representation of m and ind m q stands for the para bolic smooth induction ind m q m in iii 3 prop 3 we show that ig p q and scalar extension are compatible for any r triple p

what it means to be a supersingularh g r r zh g module for all p 6 g a certain central element tp of the pro p iwahori hecke ring h g should act locally nilpotently vigpiwss we say that is supersingular if i the i invariants is supersingular as a right h g r module definition 2 in iii 4 when r is algebraically closed the definition given in ahhv is equivalent by ov in iii 4 lemma 6 we show that supersingularity is compatible with scalar extension theorem 4 classification theorem for g for any r triple p q of g with irreducible admissible supersingular ig p q is an irreducible admissible r representation of g if p q and p 1 1 q 1 are two r triples of g with and 1 irreducible admissible supersingular and ig p q ig p 1 1 q 1 then p p 1 q q 1 and 1 for any irreducible admissible r representation of g there is a r triple p q of g with irreducible admissible supersingular such that ig p q when r is algebraically closed this is the classification theorem of ahhv in iii 5 we descend the classification theorem from ralg to r by a formal proof using the decom position theorem thm 1 and a lattice isomorphism l ralg lig p ralg q when is irreducible admissible supersingular of scalar extension ralg to r alg prop 1 in iii 3 remark 11 in iii 4 i 4 in iv we prove a similar classification for the simple right h g r modules when r is a field of characteristic p as in ahenv 2 when r is algebraically closed this classification uses the parabolic induction functor ind h g p modr h m modr h g from right h m r modules to right h g r modules analogue of the parabolic smooth induction indeed indgp i is naturally isomorphic to ind h g p i m for a smooth r representation of g ov an r triple p v q of h g consists of parabolic subgroups p mn q of g containing b and of a right h m r module v with q p v definition 3 as for the group it defines a right h g r module ih g p v q theorem 5 classification theorem for h g any simple right h g r module x is isomorphic to ih g p v q for some r triple p v q of h g with v simple supersingular representations of a p adic group in characteristic p 5 for any r triple p v q of h g with v simple supersingular ih g p v q is a simple h g r module if p v q and p 1 v 1 q 1 are r triples of h g with v and v 1 simple supersingular and ih g p v q ih g p 1 v 1 q 1 then p p 1 q q 1 and v v 1 the proof follows the same pattern as for the group g by a descent to r of the classification over ralg ahenv 2 in proposition 7 we prove that ih g p q and scalar extension are compatible as in the group case prop 3 assuming that r contains a root of unity of order the exponent of zk the quotient of the parahoric subgroup of z by its pro p sylow subgroup the simple supersingular h g r modules are classified oss vigpiwss thm 1 6 in particular when g is semisimple and simply connected they have dimension 1 with theorem 5 we get a complete classification of the h g r modules note that the ring h m does not embed in the ring h g and different inductions from modr h m to modr h g are possible we denote ci h g p modr h m modr h g the parabolic coinduction functor and cih g p v q the corresponding h g r module associated to an r triple p v q of h g used in abe the classi fication theorem thm 5 can be equivalently expressed with cih g p v q instead of ih g p v q as in the case where r is algebraically closed ahenv 2 cor 4 24 in the appendix we recall results of abe on the different inductions modr h m modr h g and their relations i 5 in v we give applications theorems 6 7 8 9 of the classification for g thm 4 and for h g thm 5 they were already known when r is algebraically closed except for parts ii iii of theorem 7 below theorem 6 vanishing of the smooth dual the smooth dual of an infinite dimensional irreducible admissible r representation of g is 0 this was proved by different methods when the characteristic of f is 0 in kohl and whenr is algebraically closed in ahenv 2 thm 6 4 in v 1 we deduce easily the theorem from the theorem over ralg using the scalar extension to ralg theorem 1 description of indgp for an irreducible admissible r representation of m and of ind h g p v for a simple h m r module v we write l for the lattice of subrepresentations of an r representation of g and lx for the lattice of submodules of an h g r module x recall that for a set x an upper set in p x is a set q of subsets of x such that if x 1 x 2 x and x 1 q then x 2 q write lp x for the lattice of upper sets in p x for two subsets x 1 x 2 of x write x 1 x 2 for the complementary set of x 1 x 2

which we see as a field r containing r the scalar extension r r modr modr from r to r also denoted r is faithful exact and left adjoint to the restriction from r to r the scalar extension ar of a is an r algebra and if w a left or right a module wr is an ar module an ar module of the form wr is said to descend to r remark 1 let ralg be an algebraic closure of r if a is a finitely generated r

bijective if r r is finite or if v is a finitely generated a module bkia 8 12 no 2 lemme 1 bkia 2 ii prop 16 p 110 we assume from now on in ii that v is a simple a module in particular finitely generated we write d for the commutant enda v so that d is a division algebra and e for the center of d by remark 2 the commutant of vr is dr and its center is er consider v as an a r d module that v

as an ar module then dr is left and right artinian and er is artinian bkia 8 12 n o 5 prop 5 if moreover r r is separable vr is semisimple bkia 8 12 n o 5 cor p 5 if d has finite dimension over r dr has the same dimension over r and by p 2 vr has finite length d r over a in the reverse direction lemma 1 let r r be an extension and v a simple ar module descending to a finite extension of r then homar v vr 6 0 for some simple a module v for any such v dimr v is finite if dimr v is and dimr enda v is finite if dimr endar v is proof a assume first that r r finite then ar is a free finitely generated a module so v as an a module is finitely generated and in particular has a simple quotient v homa v v 6 0 by remark 2 homar v r vr 6 0 but v r is the sum of r r copies of v so homar v vr 6 0 let v be any simple a module with homar v vr 6 0 then by the same reasoning homa v v 6 0 so dimr v is finite if dimr v is put d enda v and d endar v and let w be the maximal v isotypic submodule of vr then w is dr stable and we get an homomorphism dr endar w which is necessarily injective on d since d is a division algebra by p 4 vr has finite length so is w and endar w is a matrix algebra over d it follows that if dimr d is finite so is dimr endar w hence also dimr endar w and dimr d b let us treat the general case by assumption there is a finite subextension l of r in r and an al module u such that v r l u then u is necessarily simple by a homal u vl 6 0 for some simple a module a and by remark 2 homar v vr 6 0 conversely if v is some simple a module with homar v vr 6 0 then by remark

absolutely simple if and only if d r for bkia 8 3 no 2 cor 2 p 44 for the commutant of vr is r and p 1 implies that vr is simple if r is algebraically closed of cardinal dimr v then d r bkia 8 3 n o 2

purely inseparable extension then l k e is an artinian local ring with residue field l proof this is probably well known but i do not know a reference here is a proof when e k this is obvious assume e

by induction on i we suppose that ai 1 l k ei 1 is an artinian local ring with residue field l we show that ai has the same property clearly ai is an artinian commutative ring hence a finite product of local artinian rings eis cor 2 16 we have ai ai 1 x x p the only idempotents in ai are trivial if p x ai 1 x is unitary and satisfies p x 2 p x modulo xp then p x 1 hence ai is local as ai 1 is a quotient of ai and l is a quotient of ai 1 the field l is a quotient of ai ii 3 proof of the decomposition theorem thm 1 and cor 1 let v a simple a module of commutant d of finite dimension over r 2 the dimension of d over its center e we recall that a finite extension e e splits d i e e e d m e if and only if e is isomorphic to a maximal subfield of a matrix algebra over d bkia 8 15 no 3 prop 5 we recall also that d contains a maximal subfield which a separable extension e e of degree cr 7 24 prop or bkia 8 lo cit and 14 no 7 let r r be a normal extension containing a finite galois extension

to l l j esepe vl j the decomposition of dl shows that there are no non zero al homomorphism between vl j and vl j if j 6 j also between the simple subquotients of vl j and of vl j the al module vl j l r vr j and the ar module vr j have the same length the scalar extension to l of the ar module r r j esepe vr j is simple this being true for all l the simple subquotients of vr are absolutely simple the same is true for their scalar extension to l taking r e the al subquotients of vl are defined over e an r automorphism g of r induces an r isomorphism r v 7 g r v r j esepv r g j esep v for i j this action which corresponds to the transitive action of g on j induces a transitive action of g on the set of isomorphism classes vr j of vr j for j j so the map v autr r v where v is a simple subquotient of vr is well defined it is injective because v seen as an a module is v isotypic and it is surjective by lemma 1 this ends the proof of thm 1 remark 4 in thm 1 we note that the subquotients of vr descend to the finite galois extension e r we prove now corollary 1 we choose algebraic closures lalg ralg of l r containing a finite galois extension e r splitting d i the length of vl is less or equal to the length of vlalg and the length of vlalg is e r ii the length of ve is e r the commutant of any subquotient w of ve is contained in the commutant of w seen as an a module w is v isotypic of finite length as an a module and the dimension of the commutant d of v is finite hence the dimension of the commutant of w is finite the scalar extension from e to lalg induces a lattice isomorphism lve lvlalg any subquotient of vlalg is the scalar extension wlalg from e to lalg of some subquotient w of ve the dimension of the commutant of wlalg is equal to the dimension of

lalg hence is finite ii 4 proof of the lattice theorems theorems 2 3 corollary 2 motivated by the parabolic induction and the pro p iwahori invariant functor when r is a field of characteristic p we prove the lattice theorem theorem 2 which generalizes ahenv 1 lemma 3 11 to the setting of an adjunction f g where f c d is a functor between abelian categories of right adjoint g id g f is the unit and f g id is the counit w is a finite length object of c ks ex 8 20 p 205 familiar notions for modules extend to abelian categories lemma 3 the partially ordered set lw of subobjects of w is a lattice i e for any pair of subobjects x x of w the common subobjects of x and of x have a largest element representations of a p adic group in characteristic p 11 x x and the subobjects of w with x and x as subobjects have a smallest element x x writing x x for the direct sum we have an exact sequence 0 x x x x x x 0 proof ks prop 2 2 4 ii 5 4 axiom 3 notations 8 3 10 ii 5 ex 8 20 we prove now theorem 2 proof step 1 as g is left exact it defines a map of ordered sets lf w g l g f w if y 1 y 2 w and x is the kernel of f y 1 f y 2 then g x is the kernel of g f y 1 g f y 2 by a w is an isomorphism so y is an isomorphism for all y w so g x 0 by b x 0 so f defines a map lw f lf w the composite map lw f lf w g l g f w is an isomorphism by a so lw f lf w is injective step 2 we prove step 1 and c implies b and c by step 1 the image of a jordan holder sequence of w by f has length w it has length w and is a jordan holder sequence of f w if and only if f y is simple for any irreducible subquotient y of w i e c holds then g x is simple for any simple subquotient x of f w by a so step 1 and c imply b and c we prove in steps 3 4 5 that b and c imply the injectivity of lf w g l g f w therefore lw f lf w is a lattice isomorphism of inverse lf w 1 g lw step 3 let x be a non zero subquotient of f w of length lg x we prove by induction on the length that b implies lg g x lg x let x x a simple quotient of kernel x then g x is the kernel of g x g x as g is left exact by c g x is simple and by induction on the length we get lg g x lg g x 1 lg x 1 lg x step 4 if x is a non zero subobject of f w we prove that c and step 3 imply lg g x lg x seeing x as the kernel of the quotient map f w f w x g x is the kernel of the quotient map g f w g f w x by left exactness of g by step 3 lg g x lg x and lg g f w x lg f w x by c w f w so lg g x lg x and lg g f w x lg f w x step 5 let x x be subobjects of f w such that g x g x we show that step 4 implies x x a functor between abelian categories commutes with finite direct sums ks ii 5 axiom a 3 and a right adjoint functor is left exact ks ii 6 20 p 137 applying g to the exact sequence of lemma 3 g x x is the kernel of g x x g x g x g x x by step 4 and length count the last map is surjective but then g x x g x g x so g x x g x g x and by length preservation x x x x step 6 we showed that the properties a b and c imply the properties a b and c conversely assume the properties a b and c as g is left exact and f w has finite length by c b implies that g x 6 0 for any non zero object of f w hence b and c imply b we showed that a b b c imply that lw f lf w is a lattice isomorphism and in particular c therefore the properties a b and c hold true step 7 assume that w satisfies a b and c or equivalently a b and c by step 6 clearly a subobject of w has finite length satisfies a b and c and a quotient w w 12 g henniart and m f vigne ras has finite length and satisfies a c it satisfies also b as f w is a quotient of f w and has finite length as b implies b w satisfies a b c proof of theorem 3 the first assertions of the theorem are bkia 8 4 no 4 prop 3 no 4 thm 2 if y is stable by bw it is clear that y r v is stable by bw bv conversely assume that y r v is stable by bw bv then for y y and v v bw y bv v belongs to w r v applying an r linear form on v we see that bv v bw y belongs to y if bv 6 0 we can choose v v and such that bv v 6 0 and then bw y y proof of corollary 2 we apply theorem 3 with the endomorphisms bw and bv attached to elements b of b if b b bw idw so any y is stable by bw and if b b

the map which to as above associates the autr r alg orbit of the irreducible sub quotients of ralg is a bijection from the set of isomorphism classes of irreducible ad missible r representations of g onto the set of autr r alg orbit of isomorphism classes of irreducible admissible ralg representations of g descending to some finite extension of r this is immediate from theorem 1 if we remark that a submodule of the admissible representation ralg is also admissible of course we could apply the more precise results of theorem 1 for intermediate extensions r r and corollary 1 use lemma 4 14 g

of the simply connected cover of the derived group of g the image of gis in g is the normal subgroup g of g generated by u and g zg let denote the set of roots of t in u m and the set of simple roots we say that p is a parabolic subgroup of g and write p mn to mean that p is an f parabolic subgroup of g containing b m the levi subgroup containing z and n the unipotent radical so p mb mn the parabolic subgroups p of g are in bijection p 7 p with the subsets we have g m gn for the normal subgroup gn of g generated by n for j we write pj mjnj for the corresponding parabolic subgroup such

extension iii 4 supersingular representations in the setting of iii 3 with an algebraically closed field r of characteristic p the definition of supersingularity for an irreducible admissible r representation of g ahhv uses the hecke algebras of the irreducible smooth r representations of the special parahoric subgroups of g it is shown in ov that this definition is equivalent to a simpler one using representations of a p adic group in characteristic p 17 only the pro p iwahori hecke r algebra of g this latter definition has the advantage to extend easily to the non algebraically closed case let r be a field of characteristic p let i be a pro p iwahori subgroup of g compatible with b so that i m is a pro p iwahori subgroup of m for a parabolic subgroup p mn recall that m contains z

irreducible subquotient ig p alg q of ig p q ralg ig p ralg q the decomposition theorem for g implies that ig p q conversely let p mn q be an r triple of g with irreducible admissible supersingular we show that ig p q is irreducible by the decomposition theorem for m ralg has finite length ig p ralg q also by the lattice isomorphism l ralg lig p ralg q ig p q ralg ig p ralg q and the scalar

to a subrepresentation of ig p q ralg ig p ralg q by the lat tice isomorphism l ralg lig p ralg q ralg ig p q for a subrepresentation of ralg the representation descends to r because ig p q does by the strong compatibility of ig p q with scalar extension but ralg has no proper subrep resentation descending to r by the decomposition theorem for g so ralg and ralg ig p ralg q ig p q ralg or

classification theorem over r alg implies p p 1 q q 1 and some irreducible subquotient alg of ralg is isomorphic to some irreducible subquotient alg 1 of 1 ralg as r representations of g alg is

r r be a field extension the parabolic induction commutes with the scalar restriction from r to r and with the scalar extension from r to r hence the left resp right adjoint of the parabolic induction commutes with scalar extension resp restriction this is valid for any commutative rings r r ii let r r be a field extension for an h m r module v and an h g r module x such that ind h g p v xr we have v l h g p x r ii let r r be an extension for an r triple p v q of h g we have p v p vr if v is simple and v a subquotient of vr then p v p v e v r e vr st p v q v r st p v q vr and ih g p v q r ih g p

f vigne ras then v is the scalar extension to r of the natural action of h m r on resp st p v q resp homh m v r st p v q r l h g p proof i as for the group prop 2 it is clear that the parabolic induction 3 7 commutes with the scalar restriction from r to r and with the scalar extension from r to r hence the left resp right adjoint of the parabolic induction commutes with scalar extension resp restriction ii let v be anh m r module as anh m r module vr is v isotypic and this holds true for any subquotient v of vr if v is simple for orthogonal to p t m z for z z m acts trivially on h m r module if and only if it acts trivially on this module seen as an h m r module so p v p vr and if v is simple p v p v it is clear that e v r e vr as e v r st h m v q r e v z st h m v q st h m v q v we have st h m v q v r st h m v q vr as ind h g p commutes with scalar extension i we have ih g p v q r ind h g p v st h m v q v r ih g p vr q iii if ih g p v q r then st h m v q v r where l h g h m v by i and 4 10 if st h m v q v r then e v r where homh m v r st h m v q r as e v homh m v r st h m v q r r prop 5 and st h m v q r st h m v q r r if e v r then t m v m acts trivially on r for m m v hence also on and v zr where z is the restriction of to h m r remark 15 proposition 6 applies to the scalar extension vralg to r alg of a simple supersingular h m r module v the proof is the same as for the group remark 11 by the decomposition theorem of vralg and lemma 6 all irreducible subquotients of vralg are supersingular p p v p vralg prop 7 ii and ih g p q is irreducible by the classification theorem for h g over ralg thm 5 ahenv 2 iv 5 classification of simple modules over the pro p iwahori hecke algebra as in iii 5 for g the classification theorem for h g over ralg thm 5 descends to r by a formal proof relying on the properties 1 the decomposition theorem for h g thm 1 2 the classification theorem for h g over ralg thm 5 ahenv 2 3 the compatibility of scalar extension with ih g p q prop 7 and supersingu larity lemma 6 4 the lattice isomorphism lv ralg lih g p vralg q for the scalar extension vralg to ralg of a simple supersingular h m r module v prop 5 and remark 15 we start the proof with an arbitrary simple h g r module x by the decomposition theorem the h g ralg module xralg has finite length we choose a simple submodule x alg of xralg by the classification theorem over r alg 5 11 x alg ih g p v alg q for an ralg triple p mn valg q of g where valg is a simple supersingular h m ralg module by the decomposition theorem x alg descends to a finite extension of r and representations of a p adic group in characteristic p 25 also valg by compatibility of scalar extension with ih g p q by the decomposition theorem valg is contained in the scalar extension vralg to r alg of a simple h m r module v by compatibility of scalar extension with ih g p q and supersingularity v is supersingular p v q is an r triple of g and 5 12 ih g p vralg q ih g p v q ralg we have ih g p v alg q ih g p vralg q by the lattice isomorphism lvralg lih g p vralg q the decomposition theorem implies x ih g p v q conversely we start with an r triple p v q of h g with v simple supersingu lar and we prove that ih g p v q is simple by the decomposition theorem the h g ralg module vralg has finite length and ih g p vralg q also by the lattice iso morphism lv ralg lih g p vralg q the scalar extension is faithful and exact and ih g p v q ralg ih g p vralg q so ih g p v q has also finite length we choose a simple h g r submodule x of ih g p v q the h g ralg module xralg is contained in ih g p v q ralg hence xralg ih g p v q for an h m ralg submodule v of vralg by 5 12 and the lattice isomorphism lv ralg lih g p vralg q as ih g p v q de scends to r v is also but no proper h m ralg submodule of vralg descends to r by the decomposition theorem for h g so v vralg xralg ih g p vralg q and xralg ih g p v q ralg by compatibility of scalar extension with ih g p q so x ih g p v q and ih g p v q is simple finally let p v q and p 1 v 1 q 1 be two r triples of h g with v v 1 simple super singular and ih g p v q ih g p 1 v 1 q 1 the scalar extensions to r alg are isomor phic ih g p v q ralg ih g p 1 v 1 q 1 ralg the classification theorem for h g over ralg and 5 12 imply p p 1 q q 1 and some simple h m ralg subquotient v alg of vralg is isomorphic to some simple h m ralg subquotient v alg 1 of v 1 ralg as v alg is v isotypic and v alg 1 is v 1 isotypic as h m r module v and v 1 are isomorphic this ends the proof of the classification theorem for h g thm 5 v applications let r be a field of characteristic p and g a reductive p adic group as in iii 3 v 1 vanishing of the smooth dual the dual of modr g is homr r with the contragredient action of g that is gf gx f x for g g f homr r x the smooth dual of is k homr r k where k runs through the open compact subgroups of g a finite dimensional smooth r representation of g is fixed by an open compact sub group and its smooth dual is equal to its dual we prove thm 6 let ralg r be an algebraic closure and let be a non zero irreducible admissible r representation of g by remark 2 ralg ralg assume that 6 0 then ralg 6 0 hence ralg 6 0 implying 6 0 for some irreducible subquotient of ralg by the theorem over r alg ahenv 2 thm 6 4 the ralg dimension of is finite the ralg dimension is constant on the autr r alg orbit of by the decomposition theorem thm 10 the ralg dimension of ralg is finite it is equal to the 26 g henniart and m f vigne ras r dimension of so we proved that 6 0 implies that the r dimension of is finite v 2 lattice of submodules proof of theorem 7 v 2 1 before proving thm 7 we recall some properties of the invariant functor i mod r g modr h g see iii 1 which are specific to the pro p iwahori group i denote by a smooth r representation of m and by v a h m r module 1 the parabolic induction commutes with i ov prop 4 4 and with h g r r i g ov cor 4 7 indgp i ind h g p i m ind h g p v h g r r i g ind g p v h m r r i m m 2 the last isomorphism and the faithfulness ind h g p prop 4 show that the natural map ind h g p v ind h g p v ind h g p v h g z i g i is bijective if and only if the natural map v v v h m z i m m i m is 3 the trivial r representation of g is naturally isomorphic to r h g z i g i ov lemma 2 25 4 the i invariants of ig p q is isomorphic to ig p i m q when min iii 3 and p p i m lemma 8 let be an irreducible admissible supersingular r representation of m then min p p i m so ig p q i ih g p i m q proof the equality min follows from the classification thm 4 because is super singular iii 4 when min then is orthogonal to m iii 3 as being irreducible is generated by i m p p i m ahenv 2 thm 3 13 5 the representations ih g p v q h g rr i g and ig p v h

known that indgp r is multiplicity free of irre ducible subquotients stgq r and ind g q r is the subrepresentation of ind g p r with cosocle stgq r for p q g ly 9 therefore sending stgq r for p q to q p induces a lattice isomorphism from lindg p r onto the set of upper sets in p p to an upper set in p p is associated the subrepresentation j ind g pj p r for j in the upper set ahenv 2 prop 3 6 the h g r module ind h g p r has a filtration with quotients st h g q r for p q g by the classification theorem the st h g q r are simple not isomorphic so ind h g p r is multiplicity free of simple subquotients st h g q r for p q g applying 1 2 and 3 in v 2 the natural map ind h g p r h g z i g ind g p r representations of a p adic group in characteristic p 27 is an isomorphism and ind h g p r is bijective the properties a b c of theorem 2 are satisfied for the functor h g z i g modr h g modr g of right adjoint i and the h g r module ind h g p r so h g z i g i give lattice isomorphisms between l ind h g p r and lindgp r v 2 3 indgp st m q r and ind h g p st h m q r for q p this case is a direct conse quence of v 2 2 because indgp st m q r ind g q r q q 1 p indgq 1 r is a quotient of indgq r we deduce from v 2 2 that ind g p st m q r is multiplicity free of irreducible subquotients stgq r for q q but q does not contain any q 1 such that q q 1 p that is q q p the subrepresentation indgp st m q r of ind g p st m q r has cosocle stgq sending st g q r to q p gives a lattice isomorphism from lindg p stm q r onto the lattice of upper sets in p p which does not depend on q we deduce also from v 2 2 and remark 5 that h g z i g and i give lattice isomorphisms between l ind h g p st h m q r and lindgp st m q r v 2 4 indgp for irreducible admissible supersingular and ind h g p v for v simple su persingular indgp admits a filtration with quotients ig p q ind g p st m q for p q p and by the classification theorem the ig p q are irreducible and not isomorphic so indgp is multiplicity free of irreducible subquotients ig p q for the r triples p q of g the maps x 7 e r x 7 ind g p e r x lindm p r l e rind m p r lindgp are lattice isomorphisms this follows from the lattice theorems and the classification theorem thm 2 thm 3 thm 4 as in proposition 1 when r is algebraically closed ahenv 1 prop 3 8 for a simple supersingularh m r module v the same arguments show

is a direct con sequence of v 2 4 because indgp st m q 1 ind g q eq 1 q q 1 p indgq 1 eq 1 1 28 g henniart and m f vigne ras is a subquotient of indgp 1 1 as eq 1 ind mq p 1 1 and similarly for v we

v assume now until the end of v 2 7 that i m and i m 11 are simple and that the natural map i m h m z i m m is injective representations of a p adic group in characteristic p 29 then p 1 p i m 1 1 lemma 8 when v 1 i m 1 1 the lattice isomorphisms 2 14 2 15 between lindgp and l ind h g p i m are simply given by i and h m g z i g indgp 1 e 1 r x 7 ind g p 1 e 1 r x i 2 16 ind h g p 1 e i m 1 1 r

that they satisfy the hypotheses a b c of this theorem as the map i m h m z i m m is injective irreducible and as the parabolic induction commutes with h g z i g the natural map ind h g p i m h g z i

of g there are eight different inductions modr h m modr h g h m h g and homh m h g for associated to the eight elements of hom where gm iv 1 we we write as sets the triple corresponds to the parabolic induction ind h g p h m h g and the triple hom corresponds to ci h g p homh m h g that we call parabolic coinduction the proposi tions prop 8 prop 9 comparing these eight inductions are extracted from abeparind and abeinv to formulate them we need first to define the twist by nwgwm and the involution m m of h m twist by nwgwm let wm wp be the longest element of the weyl group of m p and w 7 nw w w
