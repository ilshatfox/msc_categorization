averages brian cook and kevin hughes abstract we obtain positive and negative results concerning lacunary discrete maximal operators defined by dilations of sufficiently nonsingular hypersurfaces arising from dio phantine equations in many variables our negative results show that this problem differs substantially from that of lacunary discrete maximal operators defined along a nonsingular hypersurface our positive results are improvements over bounds for the corresponding full maximal functions which were initially studied by magyar in order to obtain positive results we use an interpolation technique of the second author to reduce problem to a maximal function of main terms the main terms take the shape of those introduced in work of the first author which is a more localized version of the main terms that appear in work of magyar the main ingredient of this paper is a new bound on the main terms near 1 for our negative results we generalize an argument of zienkiewicz 1 introduction 1 1 background the discrete spherical averages are defined for a function f on the integer lattice zn as s n f y 1 rn x 2 f y x where x 2 x 21 x 2 2 x 2 n and rn x z n x 2 magyar mag 97 and magyar stein and wainger msw 02 considered the question of p boundedness of the discrete spherical maximal operators 1 s n f y sup n s f y a complete result on this is given in the latter work with a subsequent restricted weak type endpoint result given by ion 04 theorem a msw 02 the operator s n is bounded on p if and only if n 5 and p n n 2 while this result cannot be improved several interesting related problems concerning scenarios where the definition 1 is modified in some way remain open one difficult problem concerns the case when n 4 where the supremum taken only over odd integers 0 see mag 07 hug 12 hug 18 for more information the focus of this paper is on another problem which asks for the correct range of p boundedness for maximal operators obtained from restricting the supremum in 1 to a fixed subsequence to be precise given a subsequence l 1 2 n we are interested in the discrete spherical maximal function over l defined as 2 s n l f y sup l s f y 1 http arxiv org abs 1905 09189 v 1 2 brian cook and kevin hughes the motivation for these operators lies in euclidean harmonic analysis where they have been extensively studied in particular a result of caldero n cal 79 and independently of coifman weiss cw 78 states that the maximal function of euclidean spherical averages over a lacunary subsequence of r is bounded on lp rn for all 1 p when n 2 recall that a sequence l 1 2 r 0 is lacunary if there is a constant c 1 such that i 1 i c for all i this is an improvement over the boundedness of stein s full spherical maximal function which is bounded on lp rn precisely in the range p n n 1 and n 2 see ste 76 bou 86 the main conjecture in this euclidean setting is that the lacunary spherical maximal function is weak type 1 1 this conjecture remains open despite much interest for instance see chr 88 stw 03 ck 17 in analogy with these euclidean harmonic analysis results we expect that a discrete spherical maximal function s n l over a lacunary subsequence l n is bounded on a larger range of p zn subspaces than the range of the full maximal function given by theorem a naively one would expect that s n l is bounded on p zn for all p 1 however zienkiewicz showed that this may fail initially unaware of these limitations the authors showed that s n l may indeed be bounded on a larger range of p zn spaces for certain types of lacunary subsequences see hug 14 cook 19 b for more detail combining ideas from the authors works klm 18 recently obtained a result which only requires l to be lacunary in particular klm 18 showed that for each lacunary sequence the lacunary discrete spherical maximal function l n lacunary s n l is bounded on p zn for p n 2 n 3 and n 5 the discrete spherical maximal function and its restriction to subsequences lie in a more general context introduced by magyar in mag 02 magyar extended theorem a of magyar stein wainger to sufficiently nice positive definite hypersurfaces we will describe precisely what we mean below magyar only recorded the 2 zn boundedness of the associated maximal functions however his methods allow one to obtain p zn boundedness for a range of p slightly below 2 unfortunately determining the sharp range of p zn boundedness in the range of p or n is far too difficult a problem with current methods to convey its difficulty note that one first requires a complete resolution of waring s problem instead the goal of the current work is to obtain a general result for lacunary discrete maximal functions associated to diophantine equations in many variables a particular case of our main result yields a distinct proof of the result in klm 18 remark 1 the above problems and results as well as those below concern averages transverse to a given hypersurface and differ substantially from the indefinite case where one averages along a fixed hypersurface e g bourgain s averages along the squares in bou 88 bou 89 in the indefinite case the full maximal function along the hypersurface is equivalent up to a factor of a power of 2 to the maximal function along the dyadic sequence 2 j for j n along the hypersurface for instance the second author cook 19 a previously obtained p zn boundedness of the corresponding lacunary maximal functions for all p 1 the endpoint behavior at p 1 is subtle in all of these problems in some instances see uz 07 chr 11 mir 15 the weak type 1 1 estimate holds while in other cases see bm 10 lav 11 the weak type 1 1 estimate fails we will see below that the behavior of the maximal functions considered here which are given by transverse dilations of a hypersurface possess significantly more subtle phenomena than that of maximal operators defined along a hypersurface bounds for lacunary maximal functions given by birch magyar averages 3 1 2 the main results our results lie in the magyar s framework in mag 02 which gen eralized theorem a to averages over more general families of surfaces given by diophantine equations in many variables we describe this framework before stating our results let q be a homogeneous integral polynomial i e an integral form of degree k in n variables and define the birch rank of q denoted b q to be the co dimension of the complex singular locus z cn z 1 q z znq z 0 of q for a given test function with 0 1 we define the counting function rq q x x 1 k from bir 61 we have that 0 rq q x 1 x 1 ksupp n k 1 on the condition b q k 1 2 k an integral form q satisfying this rank condition together with the condition that q x 1 has a nonsingular solution x rn on the support of a given test function is said to be regular if q is regular for a given as is shown in mag 02 there is an infinite arithmetic progression of regular values such that has n k 1 rq the precise set of regular values is actually independent of up to the first few terms possibly although the lower bound here depends on the existence of a nonsingular solution henceforth for a regular form q let denote such an infinite arithmetic progression for we define the averages a q f y 1 rq q x x 1 k f y x these averages appear more general than the averages considered in mag 02 but the meth ods in mag 02 extend to include these averages our reason for including the cutoff is that we wish to include cases where the surface in rn given by the equation q x 1 is not compact for the full maximal function a q f y sup a q f y over the variety q 1 we have the following result due to magyar theorem b mag 02 let q be a regular integral form of degree k 1 with a sequence of regular values if a q is defined as above then we have a q 2 2 the correct exponent for p boundedness in this result remains open considering the maximal function of a delta function in zn shows that the bound on the exponent in theorem a is sharp moreover the same example shows that a q is unbounded on p zn for p n n k most likely p n n k is the sharp range of p zn boundedness for sufficiently large n with respect to the degree k of the form q as noted in hug 18 and independently by the first author the range of p zn boundedness in theorem b extends slightly to p below 4 brian cook and kevin hughes 2 but nowhere near to the critical exponent of n n k substantial improvements to the range of p zn boundedness for a q remain intractable at this time due to the present limitations of the circle method instead we are interested in bounds for lacunary maximal operators a q l f y sup l l a q l f y sup l l 1 rq l q x l x 1 k l f y x where l is a lacunary subsequence of for an integral polynomial q in n variables we define the normalized weyl sums f q q a a q n s znq e q s a q s a q where a zq and a z n q here we introduce the notations e z e 2 iz zq z qz and uq z q with the understanding that u 1 z 1 0 allowing the notation to keep track of any major arc around 0 for the statement of our main result we need the quantity 3 q sup 0 sup a uq sup a znq f q q a a q an important property of q being regular is that it forces the bound q 2 this is necessary in our approach in corollary 2 of mag 02 magyar proves that q b q 2 k 1 k 1 for b q 2 k k 1 we make this assumption on the degree and dimension implicitly throughout this bound is not sharp in general for instance one may improve it significantly when q is a diagonal form using the approach in hug 17 one may prove that for any lacunary subsequence l of the lacunary maximal function a q l is bounded on p zn for p q q 1 this improves upon the range implicit in mag 02 in this work we obtain the following further improvement note that 2 q 2 2 q 3 q q 1 precisely when q 2 theorem 1 let q be a regular integral form of degree k 1 with a sequence of regular values if l l l 1 is a lacunary sequence then the maximal operators a q l are bounded on p zn for p 2 q 2 2 q 3 and the dimension n is sufficiently large in tandem with theorem 1 we generalize zienkiewicz s probabilistic construction for spheres in zie 14 to show that there exists lacunary sequences l for which a q l is un bounded near 1 zn theorem 2 let q be a regular integral form of degree k 1 with a sequence of regular values if p 1 n n 1 then there exists a lacunary sequence l of n such that a q l is unbounded on p zn to give the reader a explicit sense of the range in theorem 1 we consider a few specific examples and compare this result to previous results and conjectures spheres when q x x 21 x 2 n n 5 we can choose any test function which is identically one on the unit sphere in rn to recover the spherical averages s n the exponential sum in question is an n fold product of one dimensional gauss sums giving that q n 2 in turn we have p boundedness of the maximal functions s n l along a lacunary sequence l for p n 2 n 3 recovering the result in klm 18 bounds for lacunary maximal functions given by birch magyar averages 5 moreover our result gives the same range of p whenever q is a positive definite integral quadratic form since q remains the same for such quadratic forms see for a proof of these bounds k spheres let q x xk 1 x k n for an k 3 where n is sufficiently large in terms of k if k is even then the obvious choice for is a test function which is identically one on the unit surface q x 1 in rn if k is odd then we choose so that the restriction its support is contained in the positive orthant alternatively one can also work with the expressions q x x 1 k xn k and choose identically one on the rn surface given by q x 1 in either case a result of ste 77 gives q n k which yields p zn boundedness for p 2 n 2 k 2 n 3 k when n k 2 see achk 18 for the precise range of n we may obtain here the exponent 2 n 2 k 2 n 3 k is smaller than the exponent n n k for which the full maximal operator a q n is unbounded birch magyar forms for a general regular form q of degree k 3 assuming that q is regular theorem 1 gives the bound p b q 2 k 1 2 k 2 b q 3 k 1 2 k 2 from the estimates in bir 61 lemma 5 4 even in the nonsingular cases where b q n this fails to reach the exponent n n k however this represents an improve ment over currently available bounds for the full maximal operator a q in all of the above cases the exponents are larger than n n 1 so that theorem 1 does not conflict with theorem 2 furthermore theorem 2 does not say that every lacunary sequence is unbounded on p zn for 1 p n n 1 in fact the first author in cook 19 b cook 19 a showed that there exists lacunary sequences l n for which a q l is bounded on p zn for all p 1 and n 5 when q x x 21 x 2 n surprisingly the second author has formulated a precise conjecture regarding the p zn boundedness when q x x 21 x 2 n see the forthcoming work hwz with the above results and examples in mind we make the following two conjectures conjecture 1 let q be a regular integral form of degree k 1 with a sequence of regular values the maximal operator a q is bounded on p zn for p n n k when the dimension n is sufficiently large with respect to the degree k conjecture 2 let q be a regular integral form of degree k 1 with a sequence of regular values if l l l 1 is a lacunary sequence then the maximal operators a q l are bounded on p zn for p n n 1 when the dimension n is sufficiently large with respect to the degree k 1 3 notation we will write f g if there exists a constant c 0 independent of all under consideration e g in n or in q such that f c g furthermore we will write f g if q f while we will write f h g if f g and f g subscripts in the above notations will denote parameters such as the dimension n or degree k of a form q on which the implicit constants may depend 6 brian cook and kevin hughes tn denotes the n dimensional torus r z n identified with the unit cube 1 2 1 2 n denotes convolution on a group such as zn tn or rn it will be clear

thank stephen wainger for discussions on this problem and for his encouragement in pursuing it this collaboration was supported by funding from the heilbronn institute for mathematical research 2 reduction to the maximal function of the main term here we give an outline of the argument for theorem 1 the main approach is in line with the argument in msw 02 which goes as follows 1 find a suitable approximation of the surface measures by fourier multipliers yielding main terms and an error term each fourier multiplier corresponds to a distinct convolution operator with an associated maximal operator 2 deduce p boundedness for the maximal operators that arise from the main terms by transference from a euclidean maximal function inequality 3 use a partial result such as the main result of mag 97 to show that the maximal operator arising from the error term is bounded on the appropriate p spaces lacunary maximal functions allow for greater flexibility in step 3 which gives us more free dom in choosing the form of our main terms in the approximation of step 1 to proceed fix a regular integral form q and a lacunary sequence l l l 1 inside a sequence of regular values of the form q for the remainder of the paper the dependence on l q and is suppressed from the notation our starting point is to find a suitable approximation to the fourier multipliers l 1 r l q x l e x of the shape m l e l however we first state our interpolation inequality which reveals what we need from e l and hence m l lemma 1 suppose that each multiplier l m l e l decomposes into terms m l and e l for each l l define the convolution operator m lf f 1 f m l and the maximal operator m f sup l 1 m lf assume that there exists some 0 such that e l l tn l bounds for lacunary maximal functions given by birch magyar averages 7 uniformly for all l n if m is bounded on p 0 zn for some 1 p 0 2 then a is bounded on p zn for all p p 0 remark 2 we will use a similar statement over rn which follows by an analogous proof proof let l m l e l and be as in the statement of the lemma write a l m l e l for the convolution operators rescpectivly associated to the multipliers l m l e l recall that ij denotes the discrete interval 2 j 1 2 j z also let p 0 denote the exponent of the lemma that is the exponent for which m is bounded since a l m l e l we have sup l ij a lf p sup l ij m lf p sup l ij e lf p for each p and all f p take p 0 p 2 since we have assumed that the maximal operator sup l ij m l is bounded on p 0 it suffices to show that the maximal operator sup l ij e l is bounded on p for p p 0 there exists a constant 0 c depending on l such that for each j we have l ij c since l l 1 is a lacunary sequence this implies that sup l ij e lf p l ij e lf p c sup l ij e lf p therefore it suffices to show that e lf p l for some 0 depending on p the hypothesis e l l tn l is equivalent to e lf 2 2 l by interpolation it now suffices to show that e lf p 0 p 0 1 uni formly for l l young s inequality implies that sup l l a l p p 1 for all 1 p since each of the averages a l is given by convolution with a probability measure since m is bounded on p 0 we have sup l l m lf p 0 m f p 0 f p 0 therefore sup l l e lf p 0 sup l l a l m l f p 0 sup l l a l p 0 sup l l m lf p 0 f p 0 as desired in our method the following form of the main term m is useful define the fourier multipliers on tn as 4 m l j q a uq a znq fq a a e a l q 10 j a q d 1 k l a q for all q ij 2 j 1 2 j here the function is a fixed smooth non negative function supported on the interval 1 5 1 5 which is identically one on 1 10 1 10 and the measure d is defined by d x x d x q x where the euclidean surface measure on the euclidean surface x rn q x 1 section 6 of bir 61 shows that the density q is well behaved and that assuming the existence of a nonsingular solution in the support of gives that d 0 8 brian cook and kevin hughes the particular shape 4 of the main term is from cook 19 b see also cook 19 a this main term relates to the decomposition used in mag 02 but more closely resembles the main terms of bou 89 our main term has the advantage of being very localized near rational points a q note that for each q 2 j 1 2 j z the multipliers 10 j a q are disjoint as a q varies over a znq while this is important in msw 02 it is more important for us that the factor of 10 j is the same for all q 2 j 1 2 j z for each we define m j q ij m j q our main term in the approximation is then m j 1 m j lemma 5 in cook 19 b yields the following 2 zn approximation for our averages lemma 2 2 approximation there exists a 0 depending on q such that l m l l tn l applying lemma 1 and lemma 2 it remains to show that the operatorm is bounded on p for p 2 q 2 2 q 3 that is when p satisfies the bound in theorem 1 to accomplish this task we will obtain bounds near 1 and bounds on 2 for each of the maximal operators m j with which to interpolate and sum up this is the dominant approach for essentially all problems of this type continuous or discrete more precisely we will use the following bound lemma 3 see mag 02 uniformly for j n we have m j 2 2 2 2 j for all q as defined in 3 this is proved in mag 02 our main contribution is to give a new estimate of the following form theorem 3 for each j n we have 5 m j p p p j 22 j for all 1 p 2 to prove theorem 1 one interpolates the bounds from lemma 3 and theorem 3 and sums over j to deduce the desired range of p we carry this out momentarily after describing how we prove theorem 3 in order to prove the latter estimates near 1 we use a mo bius inversion argument in section 3 to give a suitable rearrangement of the terms m l j q as a divisor sum of complete exponential sum analogues of the m l j q after summing over q ij we end up with a manageable expression for the multipliers m l j the use of the complete sum analogues dates back to bourgain bou 89 and in the current context these are considered in cook 19 b the presence of the characters e a l q in 4 introduces several difficulties in comparison with cook 19 a in section 4 we deal with these issues by comparison with a certain euclidean maximal function result the euclidean maximal function is bounded in section 5 and is bounds for lacunary maximal functions given by birch magyar averages 9 based on a result in dr 86 the results of section 5 only treat the maximal averages along suitable tails of l and thus the results of section 4 do as well as we shall see what constitutes the tail is reasonable and thanks to the lacunary condition this allows us to treat the maximal averages along the entire lacunary sequence l in order to conclude the proof of theorem 1 in the ultimate section proof of theorem 1 since the full maximal function is bounded on 2 zn it suffices to consider only 1 p 2 we have the maximal operator m corresponding to the multipli ers m l and the maximal operators m j corresponding to the multipliers m l j the triangle inequality implies that m p p j 1 m j p p so it suffices to show the bound m j p p 2 j for some 0 depending on p when 2 2 2 3 p 2 and all sufficiently small 0 select 1 p 0 2 close to 1 choose an 0 sufficiently small and select such that 2 interpolating the bound on 2 from lemma 1 with the p 0 bound from theorem 3 we find that m j p p 2 j for all sufficiently small 0 where t 2 1 t with t defined by the equation 1 p t p 0 1 t 2 we see that is positive precisely when t 2 1 t this is equivalent to t 2 1 this in turn occurs precisely when 1 p 2 1 p 0 1 2 1 2 in other words we require p 2 p 0 1 2 4 p 0 taking p 0 towards 1 we are allowed all p such that p 2 1 2 3 as claimed 3 completing the main terms by mo bius inversion we use the approximations to the multipliers l as defined above however the point of this section is to rearrange the functions m l j in terms of the completed multipliers j d which are defined as j d a zd a zn d fd a a e a d 10 j a d d 1 k a d this is done by an application of mo bius inversion giving a divisor sum which leads us to the constants cj d h 1 h 1 ij dh with the mo bius function by completed we are referring to the sum over a in j d which is over the complete residue class zd as opposed to ud in m j these constants are bounded in terms of simple functions of j and d 6 cj d 2 j d 1 ij d 10 brian cook and kevin hughes to see this note that the bound on cj d follows as cj d h 1 h 1 ij dh h 2 j d 1 1 ij to carry out the mo bius inversion argument we need to consider a slightly more general class of exponential sums set f a q a q l n s zn l e p s a q s a q where q q 1 qn a q a 1 q 1 an qn and l lcm q q 1 qn is the least common multiple of the set q q 1 qn notice that f a q a q q fq a a so the case when q q 1 qn simply gives us back our previously defined exponential sums an important observation concerning the exponential sums f a q a q is the following lemma 4 let q 1 be a given integer if qi does not divide q for some 1 i n then for any fixed a uq and any a uq we have f a q a q 0 proof fix q q a uq and a zq a 6 0 assume without loss of generality that q 1 does not divide q then we can write q pd and q 1 p 1 d where the greatest common divisor of p 1 and p 1 1 denoted gcd p p 1 is 1 recall that l is the least common multiple of all q 1 qn and q so that s zn l e p s a q s a q s 2 sn zl s 1 zl e p s 1 sn a q s 1 a 1 q 1 e a 2 s 2 q 2 ansn qn let q 1 pp 1 d denote the least common multiple of q and q 1 the inner sum is a multiple of s 1 zq 1 e p s 1 sn a q s 1 a 1 q 1 since q 1 l and the phase is periodic modulo q 1 the sum over s 1 zq 1 can be written as a sum of r qt over r zq and t zp 1 giving s 1 zq 1 e p s 1 sn a q s 1 a 1 q 1 r zq t zp 1 e p r qt sn a q r qt a 1 q 1 r zq e p r s 2 sn a q e ra 1 q 1 t zp 1 e pta 1 p 1 the result follows as t zp 1 e qta 1 q 1 t zp 1 e pta 1 p 1 0 because a 1 p p 1 1 we now come to the main result of this section bounds for lacunary maximal functions given by birch magyar averages 11 lemma 5 for a fixed integer q 1 we have that 7 m l j q d q q d l j d which in turn gives m l j d 1 cj d l j d proof fix a generic and consider m q j for a fixed q by the mo bius inversion formula the first claim is equivalent to d q m j d j q hence we consider d q a ud a zn d fd a a e a d 10 j a d d 1 k a d by reducing fractions this is simply d q a ud d d a un d f a d a d e a d 10 j a d d 1 k a d here d d 1 dn and by d d we mean that di d for each i applying lemma 4 lets us write this as d q a ud d q a unq f a d a d e a d 10 j a d d 1 k a d as each of the terms with d q and di d for some i do not contribute anything this last expression is a zq a znq f a q a q e a q 10 j a q d 1 k a q which is just a zq a znq fq a a e a a 10 j a q d 1 k a q this proves the first claim 12 brian cook and kevin hughes we

close this section it is worth pointing out a few corollaries of lemma 4 which will be used shortly in the statement we use the notation v d for the set s z n d q s corollary 1 for a given integer q 1 we have the following estimates 8 d q q d d 1 n v d d q q d d 1 n v d 1 a uq fq a 0 e a q 9 q 1 n v q d q a ud fd a 0 e a d and 10 q 1 n v q 1 also for t uq we also have 11 fq t 0 sup r zq d q q d d 1 n vr d 1 the statements 8 and 9 occur in standard treatments of the singular series and here they follow from direct evaluation of 7 at 0 equation 10 is also known but follows easily enough from 8 using the estimates fq a 0 q 2 for all 0 this estimate is used in the section 4 the last statement should be known but we have not found it in the literature the last estimates follows by multiplying both sides of 8 by e r q summing in zq and then using the trivial upper bound on the result from left hand side of 8 4 the discrete maximal function estimate we begin by stating a required real analytic maximal function estimate for this fix an integer d 1 and define the averages t rf y rn f d 1 k e y r d bounds for lacunary maximal functions given by birch magyar averages 13 and the tail maximal operators t f y sup l l l sup r d n t rf y for smooth compactly supported functions on rn where d 0 1 d 1 we also define the tail maximal operators t rf y sup l l l t rf y note that t f y sup r d n t rf y for these operators we have lp boundedness property proposition 1 for each p 1 there exists a positive constant c p independent of d n such that t d c p f lp rn f lp rn with an implied constant independent of d this result is enough for us to deduce the required discrete maximal function inequality which is the main goal of the current section proposition 2 let p and d 1 be given and fix j 1 if c p 0 is as stated in proposition 1 then sup l d c p f 1 l j d f p f p with an implied constant independent of d proof of proposition 2 assuming proposition 1 fix p d and j and let c c

abuse of notation u j df denotes the maximal operator defined by sup l d c u l j d f we can evaluate the convolution kernel vt d directly getting vt d x d 1 q x t mod d 1 2 1 2 n d e x d with the bound 1 2 1 2 n e x d 1 n 1 2 1 x n 1 we see that vt d x d 1 q x t mod d x dn n 1 2 1 x d n 1 this gives vt d u j df x zn d 1 q x t mod d x dn n 1 2 1 x d n 1 u j df y x an application ho lder s

those treated in proposition 1 recalling that the convolution kernel u j d has a fourier multiplier of a zn d 10 j a d d 1 k l a d which lets us write u j d f y r n u j d e r f e y d the transference principle of msw 02 section 2 reduces the result to proposition 1 5 a euclidean maximal function in this section we prove proposition 1 to do this we need the following estimate from mag 02 see lemma 6 there lemma 6 if q is a regular form of degree k in n variables then we have the decay estimate d 1 k where k 1 2 b q k 1 2 k 1 2 k 1 0 in general this estimate is not sharp but any positive k suffices for our argument for instance these bounds are readily improved in diagonal situations such as when q x xk 1 x k n where one may take k n k we now continue with the proof of proposition 1 proof of proposition 1 fix p 1 2 let c be the constant chosen so that interpolating dn at l 1 p 1 2 and d c at l 2 gives a constant of d 0 1 at lp more precisely define 0 1 by p 1 1 1 p 1 2 2 and select c by the equation n 1 c 0 note that c does not depend on d 16 brian cook and kevin hughes we use an argument similar to that of lemma 1 of section 2 here we approximate the operators t l r simply by the unshifted operator t l 0 lemma 6 paired with theorem a of dr 86 implies that t 0 is bounded on l p rn for all p 1 similarly for each fixed r we have that t r is bounded on l p rn for all p 1 at l 1 p 1 2 we have sup l sup r d n t l r t l 0 l 1 p 1 2 l 1 p 1 2 r d n sup l t r l 1 p 1 2 l 1 p 1 2 t 0 l 1 p 1 2 l 1 p 1 2 dn by our choice of c it suffices for us to show that sup r d n sup

l n l d c n 1 n k 2 l and then a sup l ij l r d n n l d c n 1 n k 2 l 2 j dc 2 n 1 n k 2 l we now choose c 4 k 1 2 c 2 n 1 so that l d c implies dc 2 n 1 n k 2 l d c this completes the proof 6 proof of theorem 3 fix 1 p 2 from section 3 we apply the triangle inequality to find that m jf p d 1 cj d sup l f 1 l j df p the right hand side is at most d 1 cj d sup l d c p f 1 l j df p d 1 cj d sup l d c p f 1 l j df p a b where c p is the constant appearing in the statement of proposition 1 to treat a we use proposition 2 which gives a d 1 cj d f p summing we find a f p d 1 1 d 2 j 2 j d j 2 j f p for b we see that b d 1 cj d l d c p f 1 l j df p for each fixed l j and d we have f 1 l j df p f p 18 brian cook and kevin hughes then b f p d 1 cj d l l d c p from the lacunary assumption on our sequence we get l l d c p c p log d which gives b f p d 1 cj d log d f p j d 1 cj d j 22 j f p this completes the proof of theorem 3 7 probabilistic counterexamples in this section we generalize zienkiewicz s probabilistic counterexamples to prove theo rem 2 throughout this section fix our form q z x 1 xn to be a homogeneous positive definite form of degree k 2 satisfying the birch rank condition b q k 1 2 k we will leave the extension to regular forms to the reader we will use the following asymptotic known as the lipschitz principle in dav 51 12 x zn q x r cqr n k oq r n k 1 for all sufficiently large r 1 the implicit constants in 12 only depend on the form for instance cq is the volume of the body q x 1 while the other implied constant depends on the n 1 dimensional volume of q x 1 this is more precise than the following which was a corollary of the main theorem in bir 61 x zn q x r h rn k moreover we have the following version for congruence classes for fixed q and b zq 13 x zn q x r and x b mod q cqq nrn k oq r n k 1 for all r 0 sufficiently large with respect to q it is important that cq is the same as in 12 since q is positive definite and x rn q x 0 for 0 defines an affine algebraic set x rn q x 0 satisfies the conditions stated in dav 51 sufficient for 12 to hold asymptotically we will use an analogous statement for the hypersurfaces of q proposition 3 for each j n there exists an r 0 j 0 sufficiently large such that for each b zn pj and r r 0 there exists a b r 2 r n such that 14 x zn q x and x n mod pj p j n 1 n k 1 proof fix a choice of b zn pj from 12 we have p jnrn k h m zn m b and q m r 2 r r 2 r q b mod pj m zn q m and m b mod pj r pj max r 2 r q n mod pj m zn q m and m n mod pj bounds for lacunary maximal functions given by birch magyar averages 19 therefore max r 2 r q n mod pj m zn q m and m n mod pj p j n 1 rn k 1 we now give the proof of theorem 2 proof of theorem 2 fix p to be an odd prime we will probabilistically construct our lacunary sequence l n by making use of 14 for each j n choose k j so that proposition 3 holds with r 0 j 2 k j order the vectors in zn pj as bi for i 1 pjd choose sj i b i 2 k j j 2 i 1 2 k j j 2 i such that 14 holds for bi for each j n we now have a finite sequence 1 pj order the set of all sj i lexicographically e g in the first index and then the second index to form the sequence l which we also write as j j n under this lexicographic ordering if j i j i then by construction 2 sj i sj i consequently j 1 2 j for each j l so that we indeed have a lacunary sequence fixing j for the moment for each t n we take our function to be ft 1 pjz t t n for x t 10 n t 10 n n we write x pjy b for some y zn and some b pj n which we identify with zn pj then for j compatible with b by the above construction we have a jft x 1 n d j z s 1 pjz t t n x z 1 n d j z s 1 pjz n b t t n z provided that t is sufficiently large with respect to pj e g t 1010 npj the right hand side of the above is 1 n d j m z n q m and m b mod pj p j n 1 by proposition 3 therefore for t sufficiently large depending on j we have x t 10 n t 10 n sup j n a jft x p x t 10 n t 10 n p j n 1 p t np j n 1 p comparing this to ft p p zn h t pj n we see that if p n n 1 then the p zn operator norm for the lacunary maximal function satisfies the lower bound sup j l a j p p p j n 1 p jn p p j n p n 1 this is unbounded on p zn for p n n 1 as j goes to infinity remark 3 it is important to note that in the above analysis one may instead choose a sequence which grows faster than lacunary e g j n such that it grows exponentially like j 1 j for any 0 or worse yet super exponentially like j 1 c j for some c 1 for which the associated maximal function is unbounded near 1 zn in particular the results of cook 19 b and hug 14 are non trivial despite being restricted to such quickly growing sequences 20 brian cook and kevin hughes references achk 18 t anderson b cook k hughes and a kumchev improved lp boundedness
