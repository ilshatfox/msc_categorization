com puter scientists a motivated uninitiated peer could encounter difficulties perusing the literature due to various synonyms and polysemes used by different schools one purpose of this note is to provide a short introduc tion for probabilists we proceed by recalling a perspective originating in a work of the second author from 2002 using it various new examples of completely uniformly distributed mod 1 sequences in the metric mean ing almost sure stochastic sense can be easily exhibited in particular we point out natural generalizations of the original p multiply equidistributed sequence kp t mod 1 k 1 where p n and t 0 1 due to hermann weyl in 1916 in passing we also derive a weyl like criterion for weakly completely equidistributed also known as wcud sequences of substan tial recent interest in mcmc simulations the translation from number theory to probability language brings into focus a version of the strong law of large numbers for weakly correlated complex valued random variables the study of which was initiated by weyl in the aforementioned manuscript followed up by davenport erdo s and leveque in 1963 and greatly extended by russell lyons in 1988 in this context an application to distributed koksma s numbers tk mod 1 k 1 where t 1 a for some a 1 and an important generalization by niederreiter and tichy from 1985 are discussed the paper contains negligible amount of new mathematics in the strict sense but its perspective and open questions included in the end could be of considerable interest to probabilists and statisticians as well as

certainly neither the first nor the last time that equidistribution is viewed using a probabilistic lense a probability and number theory enthusiast will likely recall in this context the famous erdo s kac central limit theorem ek see also du ch 2 4 9 or the celebrated monograph by kac ka 1 unlike in ka 1 ka 2 ek ke 1 ke 2 our main concern here are the completely equidistributed sequences and their generation in the abstract we deliberately alternate between equidistribution or equidistributed and two of its synonyms in particular the completely uniformly distributed sometimes followed bymod 1 and distributed in the abstract the keywords and the references see for example any of ho 1 ho 2 dt kn 1 kn 2 kr 5 kn nt 1 lac lo le 2 to ot sp mean the same as completely equidistributed uniform distribution is a fundamental probability theory concept to minimize the confusion in the rest of this note we shall i always write the uniform law when referring to the distribution of a uniform random variable and ii almost exclusively write equidistributed to mean equidistributed uniformly distributed uniformly distributed mod 1 or distributed usually preceded by one of the following attributes simply d multiply or completely let d 0 1 d be the d dimensional unit cube let r n and assume that a bounded domain g is given in rr denote by the restriction of the d dimensional

the no tation and the jargon aim to simplify reading of the present work by an inter ested probabilist or statistician in dt kn 2 kn kr 5 sp and other standard references equidistribution is defined as a property of a single deterministic sequence of real numbers nevertheless in any concrete example discussed here e g the sequences mentioned in the abstract as well as all the examples given in the forthcoming sections this property is verified only up to a null set over a certain parameter space so there seems to be no loss of generality in integrating the almost everywhere surely aspect in definitions 1 1 and 1 2 below there is one potential advantage the weyl criterion viewed in a s sense reduces to countably many applications of the strong law of large numbers slln for specially chosen sequences of dependent complex valued random variables the just made observation is the central theme of this note note in addition that the study of r 4 and r 6 types of randomness according to knuth kn 2 sec tion 3 5 see also sections 2 4 1 and 3 below makes sense only in the stochastic setting davenport erdo s and leveque delv are strongly motivated by the weyl equidistribution analysis we yet they do not mention any connections to prob ability theory lyons ly clearly refers to the main result of delv as a slln criterion but is not otherwise interested in equidistribution the weyl variant of the slln see section 2 2 is central to the analy sis of koksma kok who seems to ignore its probabilistic aspect the break through on the complete equidistribution of koksma s numbers and variations by franklin fr relies on the main result in kok but without any need of recalling the weyl variant of the slln in the background see the proof of fr theorems 14 and 15 on the surface this line of research looks more and more distant from the probability theory the classical mainstream num ber theory textbooks e g kn as well as modern references e g dt sp corroborate this point of view of equidistribution in the metric soon to be called stochastic a s sense and yet the niederreiter and tichy nt 1 met ric theorem considered by many as one of the highlights on this topic consists of lengthy and clever calculus based covariance calculations followed by an application of the slln from delv see section 2 4 1 for more details to the best of our knowledge li is the first and at present the only study of complete or other equidistribution in the metric sense which identifies the verification of weyl s criterion as a stochastic problem equivalent to count ably many slln recalled in section 2 without any additional restriction on the nature of the generator xk k in comparison holewijn ho 1 ho 2 made analogous connection and in ho 2 even applied the slln criterion of delv to the sequence of rescaled weyl s sums 2 4 but only under particularly nice probabilistic assumptions which are not satisfied in any of the examples dis cussed in the present survey in addition

similar prob abilistic number theory topics works in the setting analogous to that of ho 1 ho 2 however his analysis is not directly connected to the weyl criterion on a related topic in a pioneer study of non normal numbers and their relation to equidistribution mendes france mf also applies the slln from delv as a purely analytic result though it is not clear that a probabilistic interpretation brings a new insight in that setting interested readers are referred to kem kh for probabilistic perspectives on normal numbers the study of complete equidistribution in the standard deterministic sense and its close link to normal numbers was initiated by korobov kr 1 in 1948 korobov used weyl s criterion we for multiple and complete equidistribu tion and exhibited an explicit function f in a form of a power series such that f k mod 1 k is a completely equidistributed sequence see also kr 5 theorem 28 knuth was aware of fr but apparently unaware of either we kr 1 when he exhibited in kn 1 a deterministic completely equidistributed there called random sequence of numbers in 0 1 by extending the method of cham pernowne s that previously served to find an explicit normal number knuth kn 1 kn 2 uses his own computer science inspired criterion for complete equidistribution all the examples given in kr 1 kr 2 and kn 1 kn 2 as well as those obtained later on by the korobov school see levin le 2 korobov kr 5 and also the historical notes in kn and sp are practical to a varying degree to find out more about the deterministic setting readers are encouraged to use the pointers to synonyms and references given above as a guide to the literature we finally wish to make note of a recent spur of interest in completely equidis tributed sequences and their generalizations definable only in the stochastic setting in relation to markov chain monte carlo simulations cmno cdo ot to section 2 3 makes a brief digression in this direction importance of complete equidistribution for mcmc is not surprising in view of a long list of empirical tests that these sequences satisfy see fr kn 2 and remark 2 d e the first author is convinced that anyone who regularly runs or even looks at pseudo random simulations should benefit from reading a note of this kind disclaimer and motivation this review and tutorial is highly inclusive but by no means exhaustive the theory of equidistribution or uniform dis tribution is rich complex and fast evolving and it would be very difficult to point to a single book volume let alone a survey paper which covers all of its interesting aspects for example the list of references in the specialized survey ab 2 overlaps with ours in only four items even when focusing on complete equidistribution in the metric stochastic a s sense it seems hard to find a single expository article aimed at specialists let alone at the probability and statistics community at large we hope to have accomplished here an order of magnitude effect citing several dozens of original research papers and surveys textbooks or monographs in a brief attempt to shed a probability friendly light imsart generic ver 2014 10 16

natural and interesting open questions we wish we had come across such a paper at our very encounter with this important topic the latter thought gave the impetus to our writing 1 2 one dimensional examples suppose that d r 1 and that g is an interval we recall several well known examples of functions xk g 7 r that generate equidistributed sequences in 0 1 the first class of examples is as follows for each p n define xk t k p t t g 0 1 k 1 1 3 then k k 1 0 1 n from 1 1 are weyl s numbers of parameter p the second class of examples are the so called multiplicatively generated numbers for each m 2 3 let xk t m k t t g 0 1 k 1 1 4 and k k 1 0 1 n as in 1 1 finally if one defines for each k and any a 1 xk t t k t g 1 a k 1 1 5 then k k 1 from 1 1 are known as koksma s numbers it is well known that for each of the above three examples the sequences k k are at least simply equidistributed for almost all seeds we fr kok see also kn dt sp in fact if p 1 then the weyl sierpinski bohl equidistribution theorem is a stronger claim k t mod 1 is simply equidistributed for all irrational t one could refine the notion of a seed and call t a seed only if k t is sufficiently equidistributed the new set of seeds t would then be well defined up to a null set note that 1 3 and 1 4 are both linear in t which is not true for 1 5 the methodology developed by the second author in li was motivated by the particularly simple analysis of the linear case which can be extended under certain hypotheses on xk k to the non linear setting 1 3 multiple equidistribution with examples let d 2 be fixed a sequence of real measurable functions xk k 1 can be used to form sequences xk k 1 of d dimensional vector valued measurable functions and therefore the corresponding sequences k k 1

c comprises class b if h is set to 1 and that if h d then d h k k is formed from a strict subsequence of xk k we shall consider the above definitions with d varying over n the sequences in 1 6 will be included in the analysis of section 2 1 the equidistribution analysis is typically done on the sequences of vectors d from 1 7 yet see remark 1 c below the construction in 1 8 is par ticularly interesting from the perspective of comparison with pseudo random simulations simple equidistribution in d was defined in the paragraph preceding section 1 1 let again g be a bounded domain in rr for some r 1 definition 1 1 assume that xk k 1 is a sequence of real measurable functions on g i the sequence k k n defined in 1 1 is said to be d multiply equidistributed in 0 1 if there exists a measurable subset of seeds td of full measure or equivalently td g such that the sequence of vectors d k in 1 7 is simply equidistributed in 0 1 d for each t td ii if k k n is d multiply equidistributed in 0 1 for all d 1 then k k n is called completely equidistributed we shall often abbreviate completely equidistributed sequence in 0 1 by c e s in 0 1 occasionally we may drop the descriptive in 0 1 it is natural to also consider shifts of arbitrary fixed length definition 1 2 if for some measurable subset of seeds td h again of full mea sure we have that the sequence of vectors d h k in 1 8 is simply equidistributed in 0 1 d for all t td h then we say that k k n defined in 1 1 is d multiply equidistributed in 0 1 with respect to shift by h naturally we omit with respect to shift if h 1 and use attribute simply instead of 1 multiply if d 1 and h 1 remark 1 a fix some h n and o n 0 it is easy to check that if k k n is d multiply equidistributed in 0 1 with respect to shift by h then the same property holds on the same subset of seeds for k o k n for this reason the definitions above are stated only in the case o 0 imsart generic ver 2014 10 16 file equidist 8 tex date december 4 2018 v limic and n limic equidistribution uniform distribution a probabilist s perspective 7 b due to the just mentioned easy fact one can quickly check by averaging over h different offsets that if k k n is d multiply equidistributed in 0 1 with respect to shift by h 2 then it is also d multiply equidistributed in 0 1 in the sense of definition 1 1 note however the following example suppose k k and k k are simply equidistributed in 0 1 so that k 2 k and 1 k 2 k are equidistributed in 0 1 2 and 1 2 1 respectively then k k defined by 2 k 1 k 2 k k k 1 is simply equidistributed in 0 1 but not even simply equidistributed in 0 1 with respect to shift by 2 one could construct similar examples in the multiply equidistributed setting c as already noted the interest of including shifts becomes apparent if one compares the equidistribution with the law of large numbers lln or with monte carlo simulations using pseudo random numbers if x 1 x 2 is a se quence of i i d uniform random variables and f 0 1 d r a bounded mea surable map then ef x 1 xd is the theoretical lln limit in the l p and in the almost sure sense of 1 n n k 1 f x k 1 d 1 x k 1 d d 1 9 given a pseudo random sequence a ak k 1 a direct analogue of 1 9 is 1 n n k 1 f a k 1 d 1 a k 1 d d 1 10 and the shift by h d is typical in doing simulations while it is also true that for each choice of h o n lim n 1 n n k 1 f x k 1 h o x k 1 h d o 1 ef x 1 xd the variance and therefore the theoretical error of the approximation is the smallest if h d this variance error bound is constant over shifts h d and offsets o 1 hence 1 9 is an economical approximation each element of xk k is used once and only once and 1 10 is its direct analog d we can point the reader to at least two different derivations kn 2 sec tion 3 5 theorem c and the final note in kr 5 ch iii 20 of the following important fact if k k n is completely equidistributed then it is also omega by omega on the same set of seeds d multiply equidistributed in 0 1 with respect to shift by h for each d 1 and each h 2 due to this fact and the observations made in b defining completely equidistributed with re spect to shifts is superfluous e as a consequence of d and various other properties derived in fr knuth kn 1 kn 2 concludes that any c e s passes numerous empirical tests see kn 2 imsart generic ver 2014 10 16

section 2 4 gives a page long proof of their complete equidistribution as an extension of the technique from section 2 1 to the non linear setting the discussion in section 2 4 1 serves to put this into perspective with respect to kok fr and nt 1 section 3 recalls the main observations made in this and the next section and discusses several natural open problems 2 equidistribution via probabilistic reasoning the purpose of this section is to describe the approach of li as well as to put it into perspective with respect to kok fr nt 1 2 1 a lesson from the linear case consider the set of multi indices m m 1 m 2 md zd let xk k n be a sequence of functions soon taken to be linear as in definitions 1 1 1 2 and let points k d be defined by 1 6 define the sequence n n of purely atomic finite probability measures on 0 1 d via n n k 1 1 n k n 1 2 1 where the dependence in t g is implicit then clearly the simple equidis tribution in 0 1 d 1 2 is equivalent to the weak convergence of n n to the uniform law on 0 1 d denoted in 1 2 by as n goes to this in turn is equivalent to saying that for any polynomial p in d variables we have limn p s n ds 0 1 d p s ds from an analyst s perspective choosing the class of polynomials in the above characterization of weak convergence is suboptimal indeed if d 1 the class of complex exponentials t 7 exp 2 im t m z is orthogonal even orthonormal in l 2 0 1 and due to the stone weierstrass theorem the al gebra they generate is dense in the periodic continuous functions on 0 1 with respect to the usual sup norm the same is true

consider the quantities wn m 1 n n k 1 exp 2 im k 2 2 then k k is simply equidistributed in d if and only if wn m 0 for n and each m 6 0 recalling that in our setting each k and therefore n is in fact

r d 1 then 1 6 and 1 7 coincide leading to the conclusion that if xk k is again either from 1 3 or in 1 4 then the corresponding k k is simply equidistributed the study of multiple equidistribution

that especially on the first reading a non negligible fraction of fellow probabilists could be asking the above or a similar question it is clear that an i i d sequence of uniform random variables is a c e s in 0 1 in the sense of definition 1 1 or any of its equivalent formulations described in the previous section studying complete equidistribution starting from i i d or similar random families is precisely what probability oriented works ho 1 ho 2 lac lo did however to most non probabilist mathematicians this will not mean much especially due to the fact that the rigorous probability theory is axiomatic and the rigorous construction of rather abstract more precisely is not presented in a neat classical functional format like any of the sequences xk k and their corresponding k xk mod 1 k

defined using either 2 10 or 2 11 is completely equidis tributed in the sense of definition 1 1 let us take 2 11 for example simple equidistribution can be quickly de duced as in the previous section see remark 2 b in particular now fix some d 2 and m z 0 wlog we can assume that the weyl criterion 2 3 has been shown for the d 1 multiply case moreover due to symmetry we can and will assume md 0 we have yk t yk m t e m xk t 2 12 which in this special case reads yk t exp 2 i t d i 1 mi k i 1 t 0 1 it is clearly true that e yk 0 and e yk 2 1 for each k n it is furthermore easy to see that whenever k l c m for some c m n then i mi k i 1 l i 1 is a strictly positive integer and due to the periodicity of sine and cosine we have again e ykyl e ykyl 0 or equivalently yk and yl are uncorrelated moreover y s are uniformly bounded by 1 therefore var n k 1 yk n n k 1 k 1 l k c m 1 n 1 c m and again the argument lln b lln d using the simplification from re mark 2 a applies by induction on d we obtain the above stated complete equidistribution the proof for 2 10 follows the very same steps the reader is undoubtedly able to construct further new examples of c e s for which the elements of yk

2 13 its proof strongly relies on the uniform boundedness of the individual random variables y but not at all on their particular complex exponential form see lyons ly theorem 1 lyons ly takes moreover general complex valued se quence yk k and derives different generalizations of the above slln criterion of delv where the uniform boundedness condition is replaced by various bounded moment conditions remark 3 in view of the slln stated here the fact that the sequences of functions from section 2 1 3 generate c e s is again trivial just like with the usual slln of lln a d and remark 2 a it is important here that all the covariances can be computed or adequately uniformly estimated 2 3 weyl like criterion for weakly c e s recall the random discrepancy sequences introduced in section 2 1 1 owen and tribble e g ot definition 2 or to definition 5 define weak complete equidistribution aka wcud in terms of the weak er convergence of the dis crepancy sequence as follows k k is wcud if and only if d d n 0 or equiv alently since the limit is deterministic if d d n 0 in probability for each d 1 the following a s convergence along subsequences characterization is well known a sequence of random variables xn n converges in probability to x if and only if for any subsequence nk k one can find a further subsequence nk j j such that xnk j converges to x almost surely let us apply it to the discrepancy sequences and conclude due to the countability of n and the arzela ascoli diagonalization scheme that for any subsequence nk k one can find a further subsequence nk j j and a single event borel measurable set gf of full probability such that d dnk j t 0 for all d 1 and all t gf g but now we recall as in section 2 1 1 that the above convergence is equivalent t by t to the

reasoning of section 2 1 and definition 2 12 to the statement lim j 1 nk j nk j k 1 yk m 0 on gf for each m zd 0 and each d n 2 14 this leads to the following conclusion for each subsequence nk k one can find a further subsequence nk j j such that for each m zd 0 the rescaled weyl sums indexed by m converge to 0 along that sub sub sequence almost surely in other words for each d and m zd 0 instead of 2 6 we arrived to lim n sn n lim n 1 n n k 1 yk m 0 in probability 2 15 finally recalling that in our special setting sn n is uniformly bounded by 1 the adaptation of lebesgue dominated convergence theorem says that 2 15 is equivalent to lim n e sn n lim n e sn n 0 2 16 we record the above sequentially made equivalences as lemma 2 1 sufficiency and necessity for weak c e s aka wcud let xk k be a sequence of random variables or measurable functions on g yk m be defined by 2 12 and k k by 1 1 then k k is weakly completely equidistributed in 0 1 if and only if 2 16 is valid for each d and m zd 0 in view of lemma 2 1 the claim from to that wcud sequences are hard to construct seems rather surprising 2 4 extensions to the non linear setting as already noted the reasoning of section 2 1 is crucially connected to linearity only through 2 5 in particular if we were to take 1 5 or some other sequence of functions then apply 1 7 to obtain d dimensional vector sequences and plug them into 2

section 2 1 3 for a detailed discussion of problems with non linearity see ai in the special case of koksma s numbers the probability p is set to renor malized by a 1 on 1 a or equivalently p is the

derivation kok of the simple equidistribution of koksma s numbers was similar to that included above see also kn i theorem 4 3 and easier due to the fact that a simpler polynomial m g replaces p g in 2 19 as already mentioned in the introduction franklin fr found a way again similar to the calculus exercise above of building on koksma s analysis without directly applying weyl s criterion for multiple equidistribution koksma kok showed in addition a stronger type of equidistribution sup pose that ak k is a sequence of positive distinct integers and consider the re ordering with possible deletion of koksma s numbers obtained via 1 1 from xak k 1 defined as in 1 5 the obtained sequence is again simply equidis tributed niederreiter and tichy nt 1 proved that the above arbitrarily per muted sub sequence of koksma numbers is in fact completely equidistributed thus confirming a guess of knuth s kn 2 who called the above property pseudo random of r 4 type as it turns out the arguments in nt 1 are equally based on probabilistic reasoning using the delv variant 2 13 of the slln and covariance calculations for the benefit of the reader we sketch it next suppose initially that for each

non linear setting of which the proto type is xk t t log t rk wk k 1 where rk k resp wk k are sequences of positive resp natural numbers satisfying certain hypotheses this may not be so interesting even though there is no obvious reduction of such sequences to ex ponential sequences of section 2 4 1 in view of the main theorem of niederreiter and tichy nt 1 nt 2 however the approach to complete equidistribution implicit in li and made explicit in section 2 is interesting in particular it leads to the realization that nt 1 is based on probability arguments a careful reader must have noticed that 2 13 is only a sufficiency condi tion for the slln 2 6 davenport erdo s and leveque also state in delv main only theorem on the contrary however these counter examples do not either imply nor disprove the necessity of assumption n 1 n e sn n 2 for the slln of the corresponding weyl sums indeed it could be that xk are purely constant random variables and such that for some m zd 0 we have that e sn m 2 n 2 sn m 2 n 2 is both 1 logn and o 1 korobov kr 4 guarantees that such examples exist so that the slln happens even though the series in the criterion diverges however here we would trivially have for the same d and m zd 0 that n 1 n var sn m n and lim n e sn m 2 n 2 0 3 1 while the above example is arguably contrived it already illustrates the fol lowing straight forward consequence of 2 13 or more precisely of its gener alization ly theorem 1 3 1 is a strictly stronger sufficiency criterion for the slln of the corresponding indexed by m weyl sums than that given in

complete collection of them meaning that 3 1 is true for all m zd 0 and all d n necessary for complete equidistribution of the corresponding if not are there natural additional easy to check hypotheses on xk k under which these families of criteria become necessary they are always sufficient as pointed out in section 2 4 1 we know from nt 1 that koksma s numbers are of r 4 type and that the same is true as shown in nt 2 for a large class of other exponentially generated sequences a trivial example of a c e s which is also r 4 and even r 6 in knuth s terminology is the infinite

community in particular as examples of so called lacunary sequences we could not find them on the list of c e s in any the standard references however 2 11 was studied by korobov kr 3 in connection to an explicit example of a simply equidistributed sequence they seem amenable to analysis and natural for continuing the investigation in knuth s framework who anticipated the result of nt 1 but at the

s e g var k 1 c d 0 for all k and and all 0 c d 1 is of r 4 type if not is there a natural and easy to check characterization of when the complete equidistribution type r 1 implies r 4 by the way note that if an infinite sequence of random variables k k on 0 1 b is both completely equidistributed in 0 1 that is of type r 1 and exchangeable see e g du example 5 6 4 then it must be equal in law to is there a natural exchangeability like property clearly stronger than r 4 type though weaker than exchangeability that would jointly with c e s still imply that the sequence k k has the law of is there a natural condition stronger than c e s but weaker than i i d that would imply jointly with r 4 type that the sequence k k has the law of once equidistribution is established it is natural to ask about the rate of convergence in 1 2 or in analogous multi dimensional expressions that corre spond to definitions 1 1 1 2 the discrepancy sequences as recalled in section 2 1 1 seem to be the principal object for this analysis already in the focus of classical studies by the founders of analytic number theory see kn chap ter 2 and dt sections 1 1 1 2 from the stochastic point of view it seems more interesting to study discrepancy as a random variable in particular the well known erdo s tura n koksma inequality see e g dt theorem 1 21 can be restated in the present setting as follows if h is a positive integer and for m zd we let r m d i 1 max 1 mi then it is true t by t that d d n 3 2 d 2 h 1 0 m h 1 r m 1 n n k 1 yk m substantial work by the tichy school has been done on multi dimensional discrepancy estimation of koksma s numbers and variations in particular tichy ti obtains in the context of nt 2 more precisely xk t t ak t 1 for some ak r and the minimal distance between different powers is bounded below by 0 bounds on d d n of the form o n 1 2 for any 0 even if the multiplicity d is not fixed but diverges as logn raised to a small power and goldstern go extends these to the setting where the replication between the exponents an is possible but infrequent and the minimal distance between the exponents may slowly converge to 0 see also notes on the literature in dt
