supersingular locus of a shimura variety for a quaternionic unitary similitude group of degree 2 over a ramified odd prime p if the level at p is given by a special maximal compact open subgroup more precisely we show that such a locus is purely 2 dimensional and every irreducible component is birational to the fermat surface furthermore we have an estimation of the numbers of connected and irreducible components to prove these assertions we completely determine the structure of the underlying reduced scheme of the rapoport zink space for the quaternionic unitary similitude group of degree 2 with a special parahoric level we prove that such a scheme is purely 2 dimensional and every irreducible component is isomorphic to the fermat surface we also determine its connected components irreducible components and their intersection behaviors by means of the bruhat tits building of pgsp 4 qp in addition we compute the intersection multiplicity of the ggp cycles associated

introduction let g x be a shimura datum that is a pair consisting of a reductive connected group g over q and a finite disjoint union of hermitian symmetric domains x satisfying certain conditions let af be the finite ade le ring of q for a compact open subgroup k of g af we associate a complex manifold shk g x an g q x g af k called the shimura variety ifk is sufficiently small the shimura variety shk g x an descends to a quasi projective variety shk g x over a number field e depending on g x which is called the reflex field next let p be a prime number and a p f the finite ade le ring without p component fix a place of e above p and we denote by oe the completion of the integer ring of e with respect to moreover we assume that g x is of pel type and k kpkp where k p is a subgroup of g a p f and kp is a parahoric subgroup of g qp then rapoport and zink construct in rz 96 a scheme sk over oe which is a moduli space of abelian varieties with additional structures in particular if g q r is isomorphic to gsp 2 n for some n z 0 then it is an integral model of shk g x now consider the geometric special fiber sk fp of sk and define s ss k as the reduced closed subscheme of sk fp consisting of points such that the corresponding abelian varieties are supersingular this s ssk is called the supersingular locus making concrete descriptions of supersingular loci is important for example for unitary and orthogo nal shimura varieties we have an application to the arithmetic intersection problem conjectured by kudla in kud 02 it predicts a relation between the intersection multiplicities of certain cycles called special cycles and the fourier coefficients of the derivatives of an eisenstein series some partial results are known for the conjecture above by using descriptions of supersingular loci e g kr 00 for siegel 3 folds and ter 11 for hilbert modular surfaces there are many known results for descriptions of supersingular loci we give some results which are related to this paper in the following the case for g gsp 2 n that is a siegel modular variety and kp is hyperspecial for n 2 3 katsura and oort ko 87 a ko 87 b describe the structure of s ssk more precisely when n 2 they proved that each irreducible component is birational to p 1 fp for general n li and oort lo 98 give formulas on dimension and the number of irreducible components of s ssk the case for g gu 1 n 1 associated to an imaginary quadratic extension l q p is an odd prime which inerts in l and kp is hyperspecial in this case the structure of s ss k is given by vollaard vol 10 for n 3 and vollaard and wedhorn vw 11 in general recently cho cho 18 considered in the case when kp is a parahoric subgroup given by the stabilizer of a single lattice and any n the case for g gu 2 2 associated to an imaginary quadratic extension l q p is an odd prime which inerts in l and kp is hyperspecial in this case howard and pappas hp 14 give an explicit description of the structure of s ssk their method relies on an exceptional isomorphism between gu 2 2 and gspin 4 2 corresponding to the identity a 3 d 3 of the dyinkin diagrams the supersingular locus 3 the case for g gspinn 2 p is an odd prime and kp is hyperspecial the structure of s ssk is given by howard and pappas hp 17 by using the same method as that for gu 2 2 as above for more history of works see the introductions of vol 10 and wu 16 in this paper we describe the supersingular locus of the integral model of the shimura variety for a quaternionic unitary similitude group of degree 2 with coefficient d an indefinite quaternion algebra over q when p is an odd prime which ramifies in d and kp is a special maximal compact open subgroup we also consider the related rapoport zink space which is associated to the quaternionic unitary similitude group of degree 2 moreover as another application of the results on the rapoport zink space we compute the intersection multiplicity of certain cycles which is called the ggp cycles let us explain our results more precisely in the sequel throughout this paper let p 2 be an odd prime number 1 1 main theorem local results let qp be the field of p adic numbers andd the quaternion division algebra over qp write d as below d qp 2 z p z p 2 2 p we define an involution on d by d trd d d 1 then the maximal order od of d is stable under let fp be a finite field of p

x 0 spec fp s such that the pull back of the polarization of x equals c 0 for some c q p here s is the closed subscheme of s defined by the ideal sheaf pos it is a formal scheme over spfw which is locally formally of finite type note that there is an action of gsp 4 qp on mg moreover there is a decomposition into open and closed formal subschemes mg i z m i g wherem i g is the locus ofmg where ordp c i the action of gsp 4 qp onmg implies that each m i g are isomorphic to each other we denote by b the bruhat tits building of pgsp 4 qp the main theorem in this section is describing the underlying reduced subschememredg ofmg by means of b let verths be the set of all hyperspecial vertices of b vertns the set of all non special vertices of b and edgehs the set of all edges connecting two adjacent hyperspecial vertices moreover put ve verths vertns edgehs we introduce an order on ve for distinct x y ve we have x y if one of the following hold x vertns y verths and x y are adjacent x vertns y edgehs and x y is the set of all vertices of a 2 simplex in b x edgehs y verths and y x 4 y oki for x ve we associate a reduced closed subscheme mg x of the underlying reduced scheme mredg ofmg see section 5 3 moreover putm 0 g x mg x m 0 g theorem 1 1 i theorem 5 42 i for x y ve we have mg y mg x if and only if y x ii theorem 5 42 ii let x ve if x vertns then m 0 g x is a single fp rational point if x edgehs then m 0 g x is isomorphic to p 1 fp if x verths then m 0 g x is isomorphic to the fermat surface defined by x p 1 0 x p 1 1 x p 1 2 x p 1 3 0 in projfp x 0 x 1 x 2 x 3 in particular m 0 g x is projective smooth and irreducible of dimension d x where d x 2 if x verths 1 if x edgehs 0 if x vertns for x ve put bt 0 g x m 0 g x y xm 0 g y then the closure of bt 0 g x inm 0 red g equalsm 0 g x by theorem 1 1 ii moreover theorem 1 1 i implies that it is equal to y xbt 0 g y theorem 1 2 i theorem 5 42 iii we have a locally closed stratification called the bruhat tits

the coxeter element where d x is an integer defined in ii in addition to theorem 1 2 we can also describe the non formally smooth locus of the formal scheme mg by using the bruhat tits strata note thatmg is regular and flat over spfw see corollary 4 2 theorem 1 3 theorem 5 42 iv the non formally smooth locus of m 0 g equals vertns bt 0 g x 1 2 main theorem global results let d be an indefinite quaternion algebra over q which is ramified at p and v a skew hermitian d module of rank 2 in the sense of kot 92 as in section 7 1 put g gu v which is an algebraic group over q then g is a non trivial inner form of gsp 4 over q in particular the same assertion holds after the base change from q to qp on the other hand we have g q r gsp 4 let x be a g r conjugacy class inside the set of all homomorphisms resc rgm g q r which contains the homomorphism induced by resc rgm gsp 4 a b 1 7 ae 2 be 2 be 2 ae 2 here e 2 is the unit matrix of size 2 now fix an order od of d which is maximal at p we write k kpkp where k p g apf and kp g qp then we further assume that kp is the stabilizer of a self dual od z zp lattice see section 7 1 then the algebraic variety shk g x is defined over q and it is 3 dimensional moreover sk is defined over z p as a moduli space of abelian 4 folds with od linear actions polarizations and kp level structures see section 7 2 the supersingular locus 5 theorem 1 4

iii theorem 7 12 ii let f be an irreducible component of s ssk then the following hold there are at most p 1 p 2 1 irreducible components of s ssk whose intersections with f are birational to p 1 fp here we endow the intersections with reduced structures there are at most p 1 p 2 1 irreducible components of s ssk which intersect f at a single fp rational point other irreducible components of s ssk do not intersect f iv theorem 7 12 iii each non formally smooth point in s ssk is contained in at most 2 p 1 irreducible components v theorem 7 12 iv each irreducible component of s ssk contains at most p 1 p 2 1 non formally smooth points remark 1 5 very recently wang proved in wan 19 the same results as sections 1 1 and 1 2 his research is independent of the author s one and the author recognized it after completing this paper wang s method is direct that is it does not use an exceptional isomorphism moreover he also consider a relation between his bruhat tits stratification and the affine deligne lusztig variety for g on the other hand our method can be expected to generalize for certain spinor similitude groups of arbitrary degrees see the strategy of our proof after section 1 3 for details 1 3 application computation of the intersection multiplicity of the ggp cycles let qp 2 be the unramifed quadratic extension of qp and denote by the non trivial galois automorphism of qp 2 over qp consider triples x over a w scheme s on which p is locally nilpotent where x is a 4 dimensional p divisible group over s zp 2 end x is a ring homomorphism x x is a polarization such that the following conditions are fulfilled for any a zp 2 det t a lie x t 2 trq p 2 qp a t nqp 2 qp a 2 a a note that x 0 0 0 be the object as in section 1 1 define mh the subscript h will be gu 2 2 the unramified unitary similitude group of signature 2 2 as the moduli space of quasi isogenies x ss x 0 spec fp s which commutes with the additional structures it is a formal scheme over spfw which is locally formally of finite type we have a relation betweenmg andmh as follows proposition 1 6 proposition 3 3 there is a closed immersion ig h mg mh whose image consists of x mh satisfying 1 0 end x see section 1 1 for the definition of now put end 0 x 0 end x 0 z q and end 0 od x 0 endod x 0 z q we define a 6 dimensional quadratic space as l q 0 1 f end 0 od x 0 trdend 0 od x 0 qp f 0 f f qp 0 1 end 0 x 0 6 y oki with quadratic form v 7 v v over qp moreover put j 0 h gspin l q which is an algebraic group over qp then j 0 h qp acts on l q andmh we define as the image of id ig h p z mg pz mg spfw mh called the ggp cycle moreover for g j 0 h qp put g id g we consider the intersection multiplicity g pz mg spf w mh o l og we call that g is regular semi simple and minuscule if the zp submodule l g 5 i 0 zp g i 0 1 of l q is a lattice and satisfies pl g l g l g where l g is the dual lattice of l g in l q if g is regular semi simple and minuscule and mgh 6 then g induces an action on l g l g let pg be the characteristic polynomial of g on l g l g for a non zero polynomial r fp t we define the reciprocal of r by r t t deg r r t 1 and we call that r is self reciprocal if r r then pg is self reciprocal let irr pg be the set of all monic irreducible factors of pg and irr sr pg the set of all self reciprocal monic irreducible factors of pg moreover put irrnsr pg irr pg irrsr pg let irrnsr pg be the quotient of the set irrnsr pg by the relation r cr for some c f p moreover for r irr pg let m r be the multiplicity of r in pg then the function m on irr nsr pg factors through irr nsr pg theorem 1 7 theorem 8 21 assume that g j 0 h qp is regular semi simple minuscule and satisfies mgh 6 i the following are equivalent we have g 6 there is a unique qg irrsr pg such that m qg is odd if the conditions above hold then we have g fp degqg r irrnsr pg 1 m r ii we have an equality g degqg m qg 1 2 r irrnsr pg 1 m r strategy of our proof first we explain the strategy of the proof of theorems 1 1 and 1 4 for results on singularities ofmg and sk w we determine the structure of the local model explicitly on the other hand for results on mredg and s ssk the strategy is based on the case for gu 1 n 1 over an inert prime established by vol 10 and vw 11 the method is as follows i construct a locally closed stratification of the corresponding rapoport zink space by means of a certain bruhat tits building ii apply the p adic uniformization theorem of rapoport zink rz 96 theorem 6 30 for our shimura variety and reduce to the result in i in our case the rapoport zink space appearing in i ismg and the involving bruhat tits building is b our approach to i is as follows we regard mg as a closed formal subscheme of mh by the closed immersion ig h in proposition 1 6 under this situation we can construct a closed immersion gsp 4 j 0 h which is compatible with the actions onmg andmh this induces an embedding of the bruhat tits building i b b where the supersingular locus 7 b is the bruhat tits building of j 0 h ad qp so l q qp on the other hand howard and pappas constructed in hp 14 a stratification bth ofmh by means of b we denote bymh the closure of bth in mh now we definemg x mh i x mg for x ve then we can prove the equality mg x mh i x and the desired assertions in theorem 1 1 note that our method relies on the exceptional isomorphism pgsp 4 so 5 corresponding to the identity c 2 b 2 of dynkin diagrams hence we cannot expect to generalize it to quaternionic unitary similitude groups of arbitrary degrees however we can hope it for a family of spinor similitude groups more precisely we expect such a generalization which associates an embedding son 1 son 2 this is one of our future problems next we explain the strategy of the proof of theorem 1 7 we use the argument introduced in lzhu 18 which proves a similar result for rapoport zink spaces for unramified spinor similitude groups with hyperspecial level structures the most different point from lzhu 18 is the proof of the reducedness of the bruhat tits strata of mh our proof is based on generalizing some linear algebraic results in hp 14 2 4 which does not involve the integral models of shimura varieties organization of this paper in section 2 we specify a rapoport zink space mg that we consider in this paper in section 3 we recall and refine the argument in hp 14 2 to study mg in section 4 we consider the flatness and the non formally smooth locus of mg in section 5 we introduce the notion of vertex lattices and construct the bruhat tits stratification in section 6 we interpret the bruhat tits strata in terms of deligne lusztig varieties in section 7 we specify a shimura variety and its supersingular locus that we consider and prove the global results as the first application of our local results in section 8 we define the ggp cycle and compute the intersection multiplicity for the minuscule case as the second application of our local results in appendix a we give a complement of the proof of hp 14 corollary 2 14 in appendix b we give a proof of the reducedness of the bruhat tits strata of mh acknowledgment this paper is the author s master thesis i would like to thank my advisor yoichi mieda for his constant support and encouragement he carefully read the draft version of this paper and pointed out many mistakes and typos this work was supported by the program for leading graduate schools mext japan 1 4 notation in this paper we use the following terminologies p adic fields and their extensions for an algebraically closed field k of characteristic p let w k be the ring of witt vectors over k denote by the p th power frobenius on k or its lift to w k if k fp write w and k 0 for w k and frac w k respectively we normalize the p adic valuation ordp on q qp or frac w k so that ordp p 1 dual lattices let of be one of z p zp and w where z p is the valuation ring in q with respect to ordp put f frac of further let v be a finite dimensional vector space over f with a symmetric or a symplectic form and v an of lattice then we denote the dual lattice of by v v v of except for v l q appered in section 1 3 in this case we denote the above dual lattice by perpendiculars let k be a field v a symplectic or a quadratic space over k of finite dimensional and w a k subspace of v then we denote by u the perpendicular of u in v hermitian forms let k be a field and b either a quadratic extension of k or a quaternion algebra over k we put b trd b b for b b let v be a finite free left b module in this paper a b k hermitian form on v means a non degenerate b valued bilinear form satisfying x 1 x 2 x 2 x 1 and b 1 x 1 b 2 x 2 b 1 x 1 x 2 b 2 8 y oki for b 1 b 2 b and x 1 x 2 v we can apply the results in sch 85 to it since we may regard v as a right b module by restricting scalars by b 7 b we say that a pair v where is a b k hermitian form on v as a b k hertmitian space symplectic similitude group for n z 0 let j 2 n 0 in in 0 where in is the anti diagonal matrix of size n that has 1 at every non zero entry we define an algebraic group gsp 2 n over z as gsp 2 n r a c gl 2 n r gm r taj 2 na cj 2 n for any ring r 2 rapoport zink space for gu 2 d in this section we recall a rapoport zink space for gu 2 d we use the notation in section 1 1 for a while 2 1 rapoport zink datum first we recall a rapoport zink datum of pel type defined in rz 96 definition 3 18 see also mie 20 definition 2 1 it is a tuple b ob v b l where b is a finite dimensional semi simple algebra over qp b b is an involution ob is a maximal order of b which is stable under v is a left b module which is finite dimensional over qp v v qp is a non degenerate symplectic form such that dx y x d y for any d b and x y v by the data above we define an algebraic group g over qp by 1 g r g c glb qpr v qp r gm r g v g w c v w for all v w v qp r for each qp algebra r then we can explain the remaining objects b g k 0 gm z k g qp k is a cocharacter defined over a finite extension k of k 0 l is a self dual lattice chain see rz 96 definition 3 1 definition 3 13 we require the following conditions the isocrystal v qp k 0 b has slopes in the interval 0 1 sim b p where sim g gm g c 7 c is the similitude character of g the weight decomposition of v qp k with respect to contains only the weights 0 and 1 we introduce a rapoport zink datum considered in this paper note that a partial datum is given in rz 96 1 42 let d qp 2 be the quaternion division algebra over qp such that 2 p and a a for any a qp 2 fix an element z p 2 and define an involution on d by d d 1 then we have and a a for any a qp 2 moreover the unique maximal order od of d is stable under next let v d 2 be a left d module and 0 o 2 d v an od lattice let us define a qp valued bilinear form on v by x 1 x 2 y 1 y 2 trdd qp 1 x 1 y 2 x 2 y 1 for x 1 x 2 y 1 y 2 v the supersingular locus 9 lemma 2 1 the bilinear form on v is non degenerate alternating and satisfies the following prop erties i dx y x d y for all d d and x y v ii 0 0 proof before the proof we recall some properties of the reduced trace the following hold for any d 1 d 2 d we have trdd qp d 1 d 2 trdd qp d 2 d 1 for any d d we have trdd qp d trdd qp d using these properties for d d we have trdd qp d trdd qp d 1 trdd qp d trdd qp d first we prove that is alternating take x 1 x 2 y 1 y 2 v then we have x 1 x 2 y 1 y 2 trdd qp 1 x 1 y 2 x 2 y 1 trdd qp 1 y 2 x 1 y 1 x 2 since we obtain trdd qp 1 y 2 x 1 y 1 x 2 trdd qp 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 x 1 y 1 y 2 x 1 x 2 as desired second we prove that is non degenerate take x x 1 x 2 v 0 0 we may assume x 1 6 0 then y 0 x 1 1 satisfies x y 2 6 0 by definition we show the remaining two properties the assertion i follows from the definition of for the assertion ii take x y v then we have i 0 x y trdd qp i 1 y 0 i x y trdd qp i 1 x for i 0 1 since trdd qp a b trdqp 2 qp a for a b qp 2 we have trdd qp i 1 y trdd qp i 1 x zp for all i 0 1 if and only if x y od hence the assertion ii follows let g be the algebraic group over qp defined by the tuple d od v we claim that g is isomorphic to gu 2 d which is a non trivial inner form of gsp 4 zqp and splits over qp 2 this is pointed out in rz 96 1 42 however we give a proof here to use the argument in section 7 1 we use the following lemma lemma 2 2 let k be a field whose characteristic is not equal to 2 b a quaternion algebra over k suppose that there is a subfield k 0 of k and a quaternion division algebra b 0 over k 0 such that b b 0 k 0 k let e b 0 be an element such that e e and e 2 k 0 k 0 2 define an involution of b by b ebe 1 for any b b moreover let v be a finite free left b module and a k valued symplectic form on v such that bx y x b y for any b b and x y v then there is a unique b k hermitian form on v such that trdb k e 1 x y x y for any x y v moreover if r is a k algebra g c glb kr v k r gm r and x y v k r then g x g y c x y if and only if g x g y c x y proof since e 2 k 0 k 0 2 and the characteristic of k 0 not equals 2 the subalgebra k 0 e of b 0 is a separable quadratic field extension of k 0 moreover the involution b 7 b induces the non trivial galois automorphism of k 0 e k 0 hence there is an element d b 0 such that d 2 k 0 de ed and b 0 k 0 e d by sch 85 8 12 2 theorem hence we obtain b k e d fix an element d as above first we prove the uniqueness assume that two b k hermitian forms i for i 1 2 on v satisfy x y trdb k e 1 x y i for x y v then we have 2 x y 1 x y 2 k kd kde 10 y oki in particular for fixed x 0 y 0 v 0 we obtain x 0 y 0 1 x 0 y 0 2 a 0 a 1 d a 2 ed for some a 0 a 1 a 2 k on the other hand the assertion 2 for x ex 0 dex 0 and dx 0 imply a 0 a 1 a 2 0 hence we obtain the equality of b k hermitian forms 1 2 to prove the existence define a b valued bilinear form on v by x y 1 2 ex y e 2 x y d 2 ed 1 x y ed 2 d 1 x y then is a b k hermitian form satisfying the desired condition the rest of the assertion follows from the definition of as above corollary 2 3 keep the notation in lemma 2 2 and put n rankb v we further assume that one of the following hold k is a non archimedean local field k r and b is split k is a number field and b is totally indefinite then the following hold i let v be another finite free left d module and a k valued symplectic form on v such that bx y x b y for any b b and x y v then there is a b linear isometry of symplectic spaces between v and v if and only if rankb v n ii the algebraic group g over k defined by the formula 1 for any k algebra r equals gun b in particular g is isomorphic to gsp 2 n zk if b is split proof first if k is a non archimedean local field then shi 10 theroem 25 5 or its proof and sch 85 10 1 8 ii imply that a hermitian form over b of dimension n is unique up to isometry therefore i and ii follows from lemma 2 2 second if k r and b is split then i and ii follow from the same argument by using sch 85 10 1 8 i third if k is a number field and b is totally indefinite then i and ii follows from the same argument by using sch 85 10 1 8 iii applying corollary 2 3 to k qp b d v d 2 and e we have g gu 2 d we now introduce the notion of polarized isocrystals which is called p polarized d isocrystals in mie 20 definition 2 1 definition 2 4 let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p i a polarized d isocrystal over k is a triple n where n is an isocrystal over k n n frac w k is a non degenerate symplectic form over frac w k such that the following conditions hold for any x y n dx y x d y for any d d x y p x y ii let ni i i i 1 2 be two polarized d isocrystals a morphism of polarized d isocrystals from n 1 1 1 to n 2 2 2 is a morphism f n 1 1 n 2 2 of isocrystals which satisfies the following f commutes with d actions on n 1 and n 2 there is c q p such that f x f y 2 c x y 1 for any x y n 1 let b v qp k 0 v qp k 0 d 1 a 1 d 2 a 2 7 d 1 a 1 d 2 a 2 then we have b g k 0 and sim b p by lemma 2 1 i let f b and dq v qp k 0 and extend the d action and to v qp k 0 over k 0 then dq f is a polarized d isocrystal over fp moreover dq f is an isocrystal which is isoclinic of slope 1 2 and d 0 zp w is a w lattice in dq which is stable under f and pf 1 the supersingular locus 11 let gm z k 0 g qp k 0 be the composite of the cocharacter of gsp 4 gm z k 0 gsp 4 zk 0 z 7 diag z z 1 1 and an inner twist gsp 4 zk 0 gu 2 d qpk 0 then satisfies the condition for weight decomposition finally we can easily check that n 0 n z is a self dual multi chain of od lattices in v therefore we obtain a rapoport zink datum d d od v b n 0 n z 2 2 rapoport zink space for g we denote by nilpw the category of w schemes on which p is locally nilpotent for s nilpw a p divisible group with g structure over s is a triple x consisting of the following data x is a 4 dimensional p divisible group over s od end x is a ring homomorphism x x is a polarization in the sense of rz 96 3 20 that is a quasi isogeny satisfying such that the following conditions are fulfilled for any d od kottwitz condition det t d lie x t 2 trdd qp d t nrdd qp d 2 d d there is a p divisible group with g structure x 0 0 0 over fp such that x 0 is isoclinic of slope 1 2 and 0 is an isomorphism indeed we can construct such an object from the polarized d isocrystal dq f and the self dual lattice d see the argument after mie 20 definition 2 1 now we definemg the rapoport zink space for g to be the functor that parameterizes the equivalence classes of x for s nilpw where x is a p divisible group with g structure over s and x s s x 0 specfp s is an od linear quasi isogeny such that 0 c for some locally constant function c s q p here s is the closed subscheme of s which is defined by pos two tuples x 1 1 1 1 and x 2 2 2 2 are equivalent if 12 1 lifts to an isomorphism x 1 x 2 over s by rz 96 theorem 3 25 the functor mg is representable by a formal scheme over spfw which is formally locally of finite type moreover we havemg i zm i g wherem i g is the locus of x such that c s piz p 2 3 the algebraic group j we define an algebraic group j over qp by j r g g k 0 qp r g f f g for any qp algebra r the representability of j is obtained in rz 96 proposition 1 12 we show that j is isomorphic to gsp 4 over qp this is pointed out in rz 96 1 42 for the qp rational points however we recall a proof here since the argument for the assertion will also appear in section 4 2 definition 2 5 we denote by y 1 the action 0 on x 0 we identify it as an action of on d under the isomorphism d x 0 d definition 2 6 for i 0 1 we define i di and dq i as below i 1 1 2 1 i 1 2 zp 2 zp w di i d x 0 zp w a 1 x 1 i a x for all a zp 2 dq i di w k 0 i v qp k 0 12 y oki we have equalities d d 0 d 1 dq dq 0 dq 1 and both dq 0 and dq 1 are totally isotropic cf rz 96 1 42 moreover we have equalities y 1 di d 1 i y 1 dq i dq 1 i f di d 1 i f dq i dq 1 i definition 2 7 let i 0 1 let 0 be a k 0 valued bilinear form on dq 0 as follows for any x y dq 0 x y 0 x y 1 y put f 0 y 11 f on dq 0 define v 0 a qp vector space as the f 0 fixed part of dq 0 it is 4 dimensional the bilinear form 0 is a non degenerate symplectic form on dq 0 by lemma 2 1 and dq 0 f 0 is isoclinic of slope 0 moreover we have f 0 x f 0 y 0 x y 0 for any x y dq 0 see rz 96 1 42 therefore the symplectic form 0 induces a symplectic form on v 0 and there is an isomorphism v 0 qp k 0 id dq 0 f 0 by the definition of v 0 we recall the map defined in hp 14 2 2 definition 2 8 we define a linear endomorphism on end dq as follows end dq end dq f 7 f f f 1 then end dq is isoclinic of slope 0 moreover there are isomorphisms end 0 x 0 end dq end 0 od x 0 endd dq here end dq and endd dq are the fixed parts of end dq and endd dq respectively on the other hand put 0 end dq 0 end dq 0 f 7 f 0 f f 10 then we have an isomorphism end dq 0 0 end v 0 by the definition of v 0 proposition 2 9 there are isomorphisms endd dq end dq 0 and endd dq end dq 0 0 proof first we construct a homomorphism endd dq end dq 0 take f endd dq since f commutes with qp 2 action we have f dq 0 dq 0 therefore we obtain the map endd dq end dq 0 0 f 7 f dq 0 moreover if f endd dq then f commutes with f 0 since it commutes with y 1 and f next we construct the inverse morphism of take f 0 end dq 0 0 put f 0 dq dq x y 1 y 7 f 0 x y 1 f 0 y for x y dq 0 then f 0 commutes with the d action by definition therefore we obtain the map end dq 0 endd dq moreover if f 0 end dq 0 0 then f 0 commutes with f by the definitions of and they are inverse to each other hence the assertion follows the supersingular locus 13 let r be a qp algebra then we have equalities v qp k 0 qp r dq 0 k 0 r vk 0 1 k 0 r v 0 qp r qp k 0 dq 0 qp r therefore we have v qp k 0 qp r v 0 qp r qp k 0 y 1 v 0 qp r qp k 0 proposition 2 10 i the isomorphism endd dq end dq 0 in proposition 2 9 induces an isomorphism g k 0 qp r gsp dq 0 k 0 qp r for any qp algebra r ii the isomorphism end 0 od x 0 endd dq end dq 0 0 end v 0 induced by proposition 2 9 induces an isomorphism j gsp v 0 of algebraic groups over qp proof i take a qp algebra r and g endd dq qpr glr dq 0 qpr where the isomorphism above is induced by the isomorphism in proposition 2 9 then for c r it suffices to show that we have g x g y c x y for x dq if and only if g x g y 0 c x y 0 for x dq 0 however this holds since g commutes with y 1 ii this follows from the same argument for the proof of i by using the isomorphism endod x 0 qp r glr v 0 qp r instead of endd dq qp r glr dq 0 qp r next we give a qp basis of v 0 definition 2 11 define elements ei dq 0 1 i 4 and fj dq 1 1 j 4 as follow e 1 0 0 e 2 0 0 e 3 0 0 e 4 0 0 f 1 1 0 f 2 0 1 f 3 1 0 f 4 0 1 then e 1 e 4 form a k 0 basis of dq 0 and f 1 f 4 form a k 0 basis of dq 1 lemma 2 12 i we have equalities y

1 4 other cases are similar we have e 1 f 4 1 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 1 4 1 0 0 1 4 2 0 0 1 4 0 0 1 4 1 0 0 on the other hand we have 1 0 0 trd 1 2 and thus 0 0 2 2 moreover 0 0 trd 0 and hence 1 0 0

form a basis of v 0 whose gram matrix of 0 is j 4 by lemma 2 12 the basis will be used in sections 3 3 and 5 4 14 y oki definition 2 14 we define a left action of j qp onmg by j qp mg s mg s g x 7 x g

proposition 2 15 i we have sim gp p and g 2 p p ii for any i z the morphism gip m 0 g m i g x 7 g i p x is an isomorphism iii there is an isomorphism pz mg m 0 g m 1 g 3 rapoport zink space for gu 2 2 in this section we recall and refine the method of hp 14 which studies the rapoport zink space for gu 2 2 the unramified unitary similitude group of signature 2 2 over qp with hyperspecial level structure the results in this section will be used in section 5 3 3 1 definition of the rapoport zink space for gu 2 2 here we regard v as a qp 2 vector space by forgetting the action of let h be an algebraic group over qp defined by h r g c glq p 2 qpr v qp r gm r g v g w c v w for all v w v qp r for each qp algebra r then we have a natural closed immersion g h in the following we identify g as a closed subgroup of h by for s nilpw a p divisible group with h structure over s is a triple x consisting of the following data x is a 4 dimensional p divisible group over s zp 2 end x is a ring homomorphism x x is a polarization in the sense of rz 96 3 20 such that the following conditions are fulfilled for any a zp 2 kottwitz condition det t a lie x t 2 trq p 2 qp a t nqp 2 qp a 2 a a example 3 1 let x 0 0 0 be the p divisible group with g structure fixed in section 2 1 then x 0 0 z p 2 0 is a p divisible group with h structure note that on qp 2 d in this paper as a framing object we use a p divisible group with h structure which follows from a p divisible group with g structure as in example 3 1 we define mh the rapoport zink space for h as the functor that parameterizes the equivalence classes of x for s nilpw where x is a p divisible group with h structure over s and x s s x 0 specfp s the supersingular locus 15 is a zp 2 linear quasi isogeny such that 0 c for some locally constant function c s q p two p divisible groups with h structures x 1 1 1 1 and x 2 2 2 2 are equivalent if 1 2 1 lifts to an isomorphism x 1 x 2 over s by the same reason as for mg the functor mh is representable by a formal scheme over spfw which is formally locally of finite type moreover we havemh i zm i h wherem i h is the locus of x such that c s piz p remark 3 2 i let x mh s where s nilpw and denote by h the height of then p h is a principal polarization on x moreover we have x p h mh s which is equivalent to x hence mh coincides with the rapoport zink space considered in hp 14 2 ii the formal scheme mh is attached to the rapoport zink datum qp 2 zp 2 v b pn 0 n z proposition 3 3 the morphism ig h mg mh x 7 x z p 2 is a closed immersion a tuple x inmh lies in the image of i if and only if 1 y 1 end x proof first we show that i is injective suppose that two p divisible groups withg structures x 1 1 1 1 and x 2 2 2 2 are equivalent as p divisible groups with h structures let x 1 x 2 be an iso morphism which lifts 2 11 then commutes with the actions of y 1 by the rigidity of quasi isogenies see the assertion after rz 96 definition 2 8 thus gives an equivalence between x 1 1 1 1 and x 2 2 2 2 as p divisible groups with g structures next we show the second assertion it is clear that x in mh which lies in the image of i satisfies the property 1 y 1 end x on the other hand for x in mh such that 1 y 1 end x we can define an action of on x by 1 y 1 then it is a p divisible group with g structure by the rigidity of quasi isogenies and its image under i is identical to x finally by the description of the image above and rz 96 proposition 2 9 we obtain that i is a closed immersion remark 3 4 some analogues of proposition 3 3 for unramified unitary similitude groups of signature 1 n 1 appears in lzha 19 10 and rsz 18 10 that pursue the theory of arithmetic intersection they involve the rapoport zink spacesm i 1 n 1 with fixed objects x 1 n 1 i for i 0 1 where x 1 n 1 is a p divisible group of dimension n 1 which is isoclinic of slope 1 2 zp 2 end x 1 n 1 is a ring homomorphism i x 1 n 1 x 1 n 1 is a polarization satisfying the following det t a t a t a n 1 for a zp 2 i a a i for a zp 2 ker i x 1 n 1 p and has height 2 i more precisely lzha 19 10 uses a closed immersion m 1 1 n 1 m 0 1 n to prove the kudla rapoport conjecture form 1 1 n 1 on the other hand rsz 18 10 considers a closed immersionm 0 1 n 1 m 1 1 n 3 2 special quasi endomorphisms in this section we construct a quadratic subspace l q in end 0 x 0 with a quadratic form f 7 f f over qp whose elements are called special quasi endomorphisms we realize it as a subspace of the quadratic space l q defined in hp 14 2 2 we use such a space to describe combinatorial properties of the underlying space ofmg which is similar to the case formh in hp 14 16 y oki let dq f be the polarized d isocrystal introduced in definition 2 4 we define a qp 2 qp k 0 valued hermitian form on dq by x y 1 2 0 x y 2 x y for x y dq this is a unique qp 2 qp hermitian form such that trq p 2 qp 1 1 we have the following by definition lemma 3 5 for x y dq we have f x f y p x y from now on let us fix an element zp 2 with nq p 2 qp 1 lemma 3 6 there is a w basis ei fj 1 i j 4 of d with ei d 0 and fj d 1 such that ei fj ij 0 f e 1 f 1 f e 2 f 2 f e 3 pf 3 f e 4 pf 4 f f

is the element defined in definition 2 6 proof fix a b zp 2 k 0 such that a b a b 1 for example put a 1 and b 1 2 let us define ei and fj as below e 1 ae 1 be 2 e 2 1 a e 1 1 b e 2 e 3 ae 3 be 4 e 4 a e 3 b e 4 f 1 a f 3 b f 4 f 2 af 3 bf 4 f 3 a f 1 b f 2 f 4 1 af 1 1 bf 2 by lemmas 2 12 and 3 5 the elements above satisfy the desired conditions let 2 q p 2 dq be the second exterior power of dq as a qp 2 k 0 module we regard it as a k 0 subspace of end dq by x y z x z y y z x for x y dq moreover we introduce a hermitian form on 2 q p 2 dq by v 1 v 2 w 1 w 2 v 1 w 1 v 2 w 2 v 1 w 2 v 2 w 1 for any v 1 v 2 w 1 w 2 dq we give two lemmas on this subspace lemma 3 7 let v 2 q p 2 dq and regard it as an element of end dq by the injection above then for x y dq we have x v y v x y proof this is pointed out in the proof of hp 14 proposition 2 8 however we make a proof since we use this assertion in lemma 3 11 below we may assume v x 0 y 0 for some x 0 y 0 dq in this case we have x v y x x 0 y y 0 y 0 y x 0 x y 0 x 0 y x x 0 y 0 y on the other hand we obtain v x y x 0 x y 0 y 0 x x 0 y x y 0 x 0 y x x 0 y 0 y which concludes the assertion the supersingular locus 17 lemma 3 8 we have y 1 p e 1 e 2 1 e 3 e 4 1 f 1 f 2 p f 3 f 4 as elements in end dq proof it suffices to show the equality on ei and fj since they form a k 0 basis of dq we only prove it for f 1 other cases are similar for the right hand side we have p e 1 e 2 1 e 3 e 4 1 f 1 f 2 p f 3 f 4 f 1 p e 1 e 2 f 1 p e 1 f 1 e 2 moreover we have p e 1 f 1 e 2 p 0 e 2 p e 2 by the property on ei fj in lemma 3 6 and e 2 dq 0 on the other hand we have y 1 f 1 p e 2 by the last property in lemma 3 6 hence the equality for f 1 follows let us recall the hodge star operator on 2 q p 2 dq defined in hp 14 2 2 put e 1 e 2 e 3 e 4 f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 4 q p 2 dq then the hodge star operator is the k 0 linear map 2 q p 2 dq 2 q p 2 dq such that for x 2 q p 2 dq x satisfies y x y x for any y 2 q p 2 dq remark 3 9 in hp 14 2 2 they also define the hodge star operator with respect to for any qp 2 with nq p 2 qp 1 however we use it only for 1 let us recall the linear endomorphism on end dq introduced in definition 2 8 it is defined by f 7 f f f 1 we study relations between and 2 q p 2 dq lemma 3 10 i for x y dq we have x y p 1 f x f y in particular 2 q p 2 dq is stable under that is 2 q p 2 dq is a subisocrystal of end dq ii for v w 2 q p 2 dq we have v w v w iii for v w 2 q p 2 dq put v w v w then we have iv the map commutes with proof note that the assertion i and iii are pointed out after hp 14 proposition 2 4 i take z dq then we have x y z f x f 1 z y y f 1 z x p 1 f 1 f x z y 1 f y z x by lemma 3 5 we obtain f x f 1 z y y f 1 z x p 1 f 1 f x z y 1 f y z x p 1 f x z f y f y z f x p 1 f x f y z which implies the desired equality ii we may assume v x 1 x 2 and w y 1 y 2 for some x 1 v 2 w 1 w 2 dq by i we have x 1 x 2 y 1 y 2 p 2 f x 1 f x 2 f y 1 f y 2 p 2 f x 1 f y 1 f x 2 f y 2 p 2 f x 1 f y 2 f x 2 f y 1 18 y oki on the other hand we have p 2 f x 1 f y 1 f x 2 f y 2 p 2 f x 1 f y 2 f x 2 f y 1 x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 x 1 y 2 x 2 y 1 x 1 x 2 y 1 y 2 therefore the assertion follows iii by i we have p 2 f e 1 f e 2 f e 3 f e 4 f f 1 f f 2 f f 3 f f 4 using the second property of ei and fj in lemma 3 6 we obtain p 2 f e 1 f e 2 f e 3 f e 4 f f 1 f f 2 f f 3 f f 4 which implies the assertion iv take v w 2 q p 2 dq by ii we have w v w v w v on the other hand we have w v w v w v w v by iii and the definition of hence we have v v now we define a map as follows end dq end dq h 7 0 h 0 1 we have 2 idend dq by definition lemma 3 11 i for any v 2 q p 2 dq we have v y 11 v y 1 ii for x y 2 q p 2 dq with x y dq we have x y p 1 y 1 x y 1 y in particular 2 q p 2 dq is stable under iii for v w 2 q p 2 dq we have v w v w iv for v w 2 q p 2 dq put v w v w then for a qp 2 we have 0 a 0 a v the map commutes with and proof i this follows from the equality 0 v v 0 ii take z dq by i and lemmas 3 8 3 7 we have x y z y 11 x y 1 z y y y 1 z x y 1 1 y 1 x z y y 1 y z x since a a for any a qp 2 we obtain y 11 y 1 x z y y 1 y z x p 1 y 1 x z y 1 y y 1 y z y 1 x p 1 y 1 x y 1 y z which implies the desired equality iii we may assume v x x and w y y for some x x y y dq by ii we have x x y y p 2 y 1 x y 1 x y 1 y y 1 y p 2 y 1 x y 1 y y 1 x y 1 y p 2 y 1 x y 1 y y 1 x y 1 y the supersingular locus 19 note that we can apply lemma 3 7 by lemma 3 8 hence we have p 2 y 1 x y 1 y y 1 x y 1 y p 2 y 1 x y 1 y y 1 x y 1 y x y x y x y x y x x y y therefore the assertion follows iv by ii we have 0 a p 2 ay 1 e 1 y 1 e 2 y 1 e 3 y 1 e 4 a y 1 f 1 y 1 f 2 y 1 f 3 y 1 f 4 using the last property of ei and fj in lemma 3 6 we obtain p 2 ay 1 e 1 y 1 e 2 y 1 e 3 y 1 e 4 a y 1 f 1 y 1 f 2 y 1 f 3 y 1 f 4 a e 1 e 2 e 3 e 4 af 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 on the other hand we have 0 a a e 1 e 2 e 3 e 4 af 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 since a a hence the assertion follows v the first assertion follows from the commutativity of y 1 and f for the second assertion take any v w 2 q p 2 dq by iii we have w v w v w v w v on the other hand by iv we have w v w v w v w v thus the assertion follows we set lq v 2 q p 2 dq v v endowed with a quadratic form over k 0 by q v v v see hp 14 proposition 2 4 2 for the map q being k 0 valued define the associated symmetric bilinear form on lq by v w q v w q v q w by lemma 3 10 iv lq becomes an isocrystal of slope 0 hence we can consider a qp vector space l q the fixed part of lq the structure of l q is determined in hp 14 proposition 2 6 here we refine their assertion definition 3 12 cf the proof of hp 14 proposition 2 6 we define xi 1 i 6 in lq as follow x 1 e 1 e 2 f 3 f 4 x 2 e 3 e 4 f 1 f 2 x 3 e 1 e 3 f 4 f 2 x 4 e 4 e 2 f 1 f 3 x 5 e 1 e 4 f 2 f 3 x 6 e 2 e 3 f 1 f 4 then we have xi xj 1 i j 6 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 20 y oki next we re define the elements yi 1 i 6 in lq by y 1 p x 1 1 x 2 0 y 2 p x 1 1 x 2 y 3 x 3 x 4 y 4 x 3 x 4 y 5 x 5 x 6 y 6 x 5 x 6 then the gram matrix is given by yi yj 2 1 i j 6 p 2 p 1 2 1 2 and hence y 1 y 6 form an orthogonal basis of l q put l q v l q v v l q v l q v v then yi yi for 2 i 6 by the last property in lemma 3 6 on the other hand we have y 1 y 1 by definition therefore we have l q 6 i 2 yiqp and l q y 1 qp consequently we obtain the following proposition 3 13 i we have an orthogonal decomposition l q l q l q moreover l q y 1 qp and it is the unique orthogonal complement of l q in l q hence is the reflection on l q with respect to y 1 ii the discriminant of l q q is equal to 2 p the hasse invariant of l q q equals 1 iii the discriminant of l q p 1 2 q is equal to 1 the hasse invariant of l q p 1 2 q equals 1 3 3 exceptional isomorphisms first let us recall basic facts of the theory of clifford algebras and spinor similitude groups see also bas 74 let u be a finite dimensional quadratic space over a field k and c u the clifford algebra of u we have a z 2 grading which is denoted by c u c u c u we regard u as a subspace of c u we have a canonical involution v 7 v on c u which is charac terized by v 1 vn vn v 1 for v 1 vn u we define an algebraic group gspin u over k by gspin u r g c u k r g u k r g 1 u k r g g r for any k algebra r there is an exact sequence of algebraic groups over k 1 gm gspin u so u 1 here the morphism gspin u so u is defined as gspin u r so u r g 7 v 7 gvg 1 for any k algebra r we apply the results above to l q the invariant part of lq the inclusion l q end dq induces an injection i c l q end dq by hp 14 proposition 2 4 2 it commutes with the actions of by definition the supersingular locus 21 proposition 3 14 the injection i induces an isomorphism c l q endd dq proof if v l q then we have v d d v for d hence the image of c l q by the injection i is contained in endd dq on the other hand we have dimk 0 c l q 2 5 1 16 since dimk 0 l q 5 moreover we have dimk 0 endd dq 16 since dq is free of rank 2 over d qp k 0 therefore the image of c l q by the injection i equals endd dq let r be a qp algebra we define an action of h k 0 qp r on end dq qp r end dq qp r cf hp 14 2 6 for r qp it is defined by h f h f h 1 for h h k 0 qp r and f end dq qp r if x y 2 q p 2 dq with x y dq then we have g x y sim g 1 g x g y on the other hand let h 0 k 0 qp r h h k 0 qp r sim h 2 detqp 2 qp k 0 qpr h then the action of h h k 0 qp r commutes with if and only if h h 0 k 0 qp r see hp 14 2 3 moreover hp 14 proposition 2 7 shows that there is an isomorphism of groups between h 0 k 0 and gspin lq k 0 which commutes with the actions on lq remark 3 15 the groups h k 0 and h 0 k 0 are identical to the groups gu dq and gu 0 dq in hp 14 2 3 respectively we identify dq 1 as a dual space of dq 0 by dq 0 dq 1 k 0 we also denote an element of h k 0 qp r as h 0 h 1 where hi gl dq i qp r for i 0 1 then we have following lemma 3 16 i we have two homomorphisms h k 0 qp r gl dq 0 qp r gm r h 7 h 0 sim h gl dq 0 qp r gm r h k 0 qp r h 0 c 7 h 0 c h 0 1 here h 0 1 is the dual map of h 0 they are inverse to each other ii for h h 0 h 1 h k 0 qp r we have equalities detq p 2 qp k 0 qpr h detk 0 qpr h 0 detk 0 qpr h 1 detk 0 qpr h 0 sim h 4 detk 0 qpr h 0 1 in qp 2 qp k 0 qp r k 0 qp r k 0 qp r lemma 3 17 the group g k 0 qp r is contained in h 0 k 0 qp r proof take h h 0 h 1 h k 0 qp r by lemma 3 16 we have sim h 2 detqp 2 qp k 0 qpr h if and only if sim h 2 detk 0 qpr h 0 on the other hand the map above induces an isomorphism g k 0 qp r gsp dq 0 k 0 qp r by proposition 2 10 i then the square of the similitude equals the determinant for all elements in g k 0 qp r since dimk 0 dq 0 4 by lemma 3 17 g k 0 qp r acts on l q qp r as the same formula for the action of h 0 k 0 qp r on end dq qp r 2 q p 2 dq qp r or lq qp r 22 y oki proposition 3 18 the isomorphism endd dq c l q induces an isomorphism g k 0 qp r gspin l q r which commutes with the actions on l q qp r proof we follow the proof of hp 14 proposition 2 7 take a qp algebra r and g endd dq qpr c l q r note that we have gx y x g y for any x y dq qpr by lemma 3 7 it is equivalent to the condition that gx y x g y for any x y dq qp r first suppose g g k 0 qp r by lemma 3 17 the action of g on endd dq qp r preserves the subspace lq qp r furthermore the action of g also preserves l q qp r since g is d linear on the other hand by the argument above we have x g g y g x g y sim g x y for any x y dq qp r we therefore obtain g g sim g r which concludes g gspin l q r second suppose g gspin l q r then we have g g r and g x g y x g g y g g x y for any x y dq qp r hence we have g g g g k 0 qp r the compatibility with the action on l q qp r is a consequence of the definition taking the invariants of the isomorphism in proposition 3 18 for any qp algebra r we obtain the following corollary 3 19 there is an isomorphism j gspin l q of algebraic groups over qp therefore there is an isomorphism jad so l q of algebraic groups over qp here jad is the adjoint group of j which is isomorphic to pgsp v 0 4 local model and singularity of mg in this section we prove the flatness ofmg which is conjectured after the proof of rz 96 corollary 3 35 to do this we consider the local model instead of mg itself the local model is also useful to study the singularity ofmg 4 1 local model we define the local model m locg to be the functor that parameterizes od zp os modules f of 0 zp os for any zp scheme s satisfying the following f is a direct summand of 0 zp os as an os module f f kottwitz condition det t d f t 2 trdd qp d t nrdd qp d 2 for any d od the goal of this section is the following theorem 4 1 i the scheme m locg w m loc g speczp specw is flat over specw moreover it is regular and irreducible of dimension 4 ii the scheme m locg w is smooth over specw outside the unique fp rational point x 0 such that the corresponding subspace f of 0 zp fp satisfies f 0 moreover there is an isomorphism om loc g w x 0 w t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 p t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 by rz 96 proposition 3 33 we obtain the following corollary 4 2 the formal schememg is flat over spfw moreover it is regular of purely 4 dimensional that is the local ring is regular of dimension 4 for each point and formally smooth over spfw outside the discrete set of fp rational points such that the corresponding tuple x satisfies 0 on lie x remark 4 3 there is a point inmg which is not formally smooth over spfw indeed the fp rational point corresponding to x 0 0 0 idx 0 satisfies the condition since lie x 0 d f 1 pd d y 1 d the supersingular locus 23 4 2 proof of theorem 4 1 in this paper we use a generalization of hp 14 2 4 in appendix b note that there is a more direct proof which reduces to yu 11 3 see wan 19 2 3 put l 0 v l q v d d 6 i 2 wyi l q see section 2 1 for the definition of d note that we have l 0 l 0 and lengthw l 0 l 0 1 let isotl 0 be the functor which parametrizes all isotropic lines in l 0 w os for any w scheme s here an isotropic line in l 0 w os is an os submodule of l 0 w os which is locally a direct summand of rank 1 which is totally isotropic with respect to q proposition 4 4 i for a w algebra r and f m locg w r l f v l 0 w r v f 0 is an isotropic line in l 0 w r hence f 7 l f induces a morphism of w schemes f m loc g w isotl 0 ii the morphism f in i is an isomorphism moreover the image of d w fp m locg under f equals the radical of l 0 w fp proof put l v lq v d d by lemma b 7 lr f v l w r v f 0 is an isotropic line in l w r for any f lag z p 2 d r that is a lagrangian subspace of d and f 7 lr f induces an isomorphism lag z p 2 d isotl moreover f is stable if and only if lr f l 0 w r note that the stable locus of lag z p 2 d equals m loc g w by definition hence the assertions i and the isomorphy of f follow on the other hand by the definitions of f and ei fj see lemma 3 6 we have f d w fp fpy 2 and fpy 2 is the radical of l 0 w fp hence the assertion for f d w fp follows by definition the w scheme isotl 0 is the w scheme q l 0 in the sense of hpr 18 12 7 1 hence we have the following theorem 4 5 hpr 18 proposition 12 6 there is an isomorphism of w schemes between isotl 0 and the hypersurface defined by x 1 x 4 x 2 x 3 px 2 5 0 in projw x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 moreover the radical of l 0 w fp corresponds to the unique non smooth point of the latter scheme hence all assertions in theorem 4 1 follow from theorem 4 5 5 bruhat tits stratification in this section we start to study the underlying space of mg first we describe the set of points of pz mg by specific self dual lattices in the certain quadratic space lq second we define the notion of vertex lattices they can be written in terms of the bruhat tits building of so l q qp we introduce the closed formal subschemes attached to vertex lattices and construct the locally closed stratification by them finally using the exceptional isomorphism jad qp so l q qp we rewrite the stratification above the bruhat tits building of jad qp as an application of this we also prove some properties of the j qp action onmredg 24 y oki 5 1 description of the set of geometric points ofmg in this section let k fp be a field extension w k the cohen ring of k and k fracw k we construct a bijection between the k rational points of pz mg and the set of certain lattices in lq k 0 k which is compatible with that of h in hp 14 corollary 2 14 first we recall the bijection in hp 14 2 4 a dieudonne lattice in dq k dq k 0 k is a zp 2 stable w k lattice m in dq k satisfying the following conditions m pim for some i z pm f 1 pm m dimkm f 1 pm 4 there is a relation between dieudonne lattices andmh as follows it is based on the theory of windows see zin 01 theorem 5 1 hp 14 corollary 2 11 there is a bijection mh k dieudonne lattices in dq k on the other hand a special lattice in lq k lq k 0 k is a self dual lattice l in lq k such that lengthw k l l l 1 where l is the w k lattice in lq k generated by l they are related as follows theorem 5 2 hp 14 corollary 2 14 the map pz dieudonne lattices in dq k special lattices in lq k which is defined by m 7 l m v lq k v f 1 pm f 1 pm is bijective remark 5 3 the original proof of theorem 5 2 needs a little modification we will consider it more precisely in appendix a definition 5 4 i a stable dieudonne lattice in dq k is a dieudonne lattice m in dq k such that y 1 m m ii a special lattice in lq k is a special lattice l in lq k containing y 1 the following follows from proposition 3 3 proposition 5 5 the bijection in theorem 5 1 induces a bijection mg k stable dieudonne lattices in dq k next we describe a correspondence between stable dieudonne lattices in dq k and special lattices in lq k using the bijection in theorem 5 2 proposition 5 6 the bijection in theorem 5 2 induces a bijection pz stable dieudonne lattices in dq k special lattices in lq k proof let m be a dieudonne lattice in dq k and denote the corresponding special lattice in lq k by l by the definition of the bijection in theorem 5 2 m is stable if and only if y 1 l that is l is special finally we give a relation between the action of and the map which will be used in section 5 3 proposition 5 7 let m be a stable dieudonne lattice in dq k and l a corresponding special lattice in lq k under the bijection in proposition 5 6 i if m corresponds to a point of m i g k for some i z then both y 1 m and f m are also stable dieudonne lattices in dq k and the corresponding points of mg k lie in m i 1 g the supersingular locus 25 ii under the bijection in proposition 5 6 y 1 m and f m correspond to l and l respec tively proof i we only prove the assertion for y 1 m other case is similar since the action of commutes with f we can see that y 1 m satisfies the conditions of stable dieudonne lattices except for that of relation with the dual however using the assumption m pim and lemma 2 1 we have y 1 m pi 1 y 1 m therefore the assertion for y 1 m follows ii this follows from the definition of the bijection in proposition 5 6 5 2 vertex lattices first we introduce the notion of vertex lattices which will be indices of a locally closed stratification ofmg definition 5 8 a vertex lattice is a lattice l q such that p we call t dimfp the type of we denote the set of all vertex lattices by vl lemma 5 9 for vl we have t 1 3 5 proof fix an orthogonal zp basis v 1 v 5 of this is possible since p 2 then we have t 5 i 1 ordp q vi and 0 t 5 by the definition of vertex lattices on the other hand we have ordp disc l q 5 i 1 ordp q vi mod 2 where disc l q is the discriminant of l q by proposition 3 13 ii we know that ordp disc l q is odd therefore t is also odd for t 1 3 5 we set vl t vl t t proposition 5 10 we have vl t 6 for each t 1 3 5 proof by proposition 3 13 iii there is a qp basis w 1 w 5 of l q whose gram matrix is given by p 1 0 p 1 p 1 p 1 0 p 1 now let i 1 i 3 be lattices in l q as below 1 zpw 1 zpw 2 zpw 3 zppw 4 zppw 5 2 zpw 1 zpw 2 zpw 3 zpw 4 zppw 5 3 zpw 1 zpw 2 zpw 3 zpw 4 zpw 5 then we have i vl 2 i 1 next we consider combinatorial properties of vertex lattices definition 5 11 for vl put so g so l q qp g proposition 5 12 26 y oki i if vl 1 vl 3 then vl 5 2 p 1 if t 1 2 if t 3 ii if vl 3 then vl 1 p 1 iii let vl 5 for t 1 3 the group stab acts transitively on the set vl t which has exactly p 1 p 2 1 elements iv if 1 vl 5 and 2 vl 3 then vl 5 1 2 1 v if 1 vl 5 and 2 vl 1 then vl 5 1 2 p to show the assertions above we need some results about quadratic spaces over finite fields we denote by hfp the hyperbolic plane over fp moreover we endow a 1 dimensional space fp with the norm form definition 5 13 for vl let 0 0 p these are fp vector space we endow 0 and 0 with quadratic forms 2 pq mod p and q mod p respectively lemma 5 14 let vl i if vl t for some t 1 3 then there is an isomorphism 0 h 5 t 2 fp of quadratic spaces over fp ii if vl t for some t 3 5 then there is an isomorphism 0 h t 1 2 fp fp of quadratic spaces over fp proof we will only prove the assertion i for t 3 the other assertions follow by the same argument take an orthogonal basis v 1 v 5 over zp of since vl 3 after permuting vi we may write q vi ui if i 1 2 p 1 ui if 3 i 5 for some ui z p then we have p fpv 1 fpv 2 using the basis vi the hasse invariant of l q equals p u 1 u 2 p where p is the hilbert symbol with respect to p on the other hand proposition 3 13 ii implies p u 1 u 2 p 1 that is u 1 u 2 1 in z p z p 2 therefore we have det p 1 in f p f p 2 which implies that p is isomorphic to hfp lemma 5 15 i for t z 0 the group so h tfp fp fp acts transitively on the set of all isotropic lines in h tfp fp the number of non zero isotropic lines in h t fp fp equals 2 t 1 i 0 p i ii the group so h 2 fp fp fp acts transitively on the set of all totally isotropic subspaces of dimension 2 in h 2 fp fp the number of the set above equals p 1 p 2 1 iii the number of isotropic lines in hfp equals 2 iv the number of totally isotropic subspaces of dimension 2 in h 2 fp equals 2 p 1 v let w be a totally isotropic subspaces of dimension 2 in h 2 fp then the number of lagrangian subspace w 6 w in h 2 fp such that w w 0 equals p proof these follow from wil 00 3 7 2 3 7 4 if g so then we have g which concludes that g induces an element of so 0 fp hence we obtain a homomorphism red so so 0 fp g 7 g the supersingular locus 27 lemma 5 16 under the notation above we further assume that vl 5 then the homomorphism red is surjective proof the lattice e 0 in e 0 is self dual let so e be the algebraic group over zp then we have so e zp so furthermore it induces isomorphisms so e fp so 0 fp so h 2 fp fp fp since p 2 the algebraic group so e is smooth over zp therefore the homomorphism so e zp so e fp is surjective by fu 15 proposition 2 8 13 which concludes the assertion proof of proposition 5 12 i we have a bijection below vl 5 w 0 fp subspace w w 7 p p by lemma 5 14 i and lemma 5 15 iii iv the number of the set in the right hand side equals 2 p 1 if t 1 2 if t 2 hence the assertion follows ii we have a bijection below which commutes with actions of stab and so 0 fp vl 1 p 0 fp subspace 0 6 p p 7 by lemma 5 14 ii and lemma 5 15 i so 0 fp acts transitively on the set in the right hand side which has exactly p 1 elements hence the assertion follows from lemma 5 16 iii we have a bijection below vl t p 0 fp subspace 0 6 p p dimfp p 5 t 2 7 p by lemma 5 14 ii and lemma 5 15 ii the number of the set in the right hand side equals p 1 p 2 1 applying lemma 5 16 to we obtain the assertion iv the bijection in the proof of i for 2 induces a bijection vl 5 2 1 2 w 2 fp subspace w w w p 1 p 0 by lemma 5 15 iii the number of the right hand side of the bijection above equals 1 hence the assertion follows v the bijection in the proof of i for 2 induces a bijection vl 5 2 1 2 w 2 fp subspace w w w p 1 p 0 by lemma 5 15 v the number of the right hand side of the bijection above equals p hence the assertion follows next we state the property which concerns with the connectedness ofm 0 g the proof is exactly the same as that of hp 17 proposition 5 1 5 proposition 5 17 for any vl there is a sequence 0 1 n such that every i lies in vl and we have either i i 1 or i i 1 for each i 0 n 1 in the sequel we call a vertex lattice in the sense of hp 14 definition 2 17 an h vertex lattice denote by vlh the set of all h vertex lattices we relate vertex lattices with h vertex lattices definition 5 18 for any lattice l in lq or l q we denote the dual lattice of l by l 28 y oki proposition 5 19 we have two maps vl vlh p 1 y 1 7 p 1 y 1 zp vlh p 1 y 1 vl 7 l q they are inverse to each other moreover if vl t for some t 1 3 5 then is an h vertex lattice of type t 1 to prove the assertion above we need the following lemma 5 20 let be an h vertex lattice containing p 1 y 1 then we have y qpy 1 there is an element z l q such that y z p 1 y 1 zp proof we use the correspondence between h vertex lattices and lattices l in h 2 qp 2 l q p 1 q with l l p 1 l appearing in the proof of hp 14 proposition 2 22 here l is the dual lattice of l with respect to p 1 q under this correspondence the assertion is equivalent to the formula e y qp there is an element z h 2 qp such that y z p zp by shi 10 lemma 29 2 1 3 there is a self dual lattice l containing p note that 1 l since p 1 y 1 hence we have a decomposition l l 0 zp where l 0 l h 2 qp since e is the image of p under the second projection h 2 qp qp qp the assertion follows proof of proposition 5 19 if is a vertex lattice of type t 1 3 5 then is an h vertex lattice of type t 1 containing p 1 y 1 since y 1 zp on the other hand if is an h vertex lattice containing p 1 y 1 then we have l p 1 y 1 zp by lemma 5 20 since is an h vertex lattice we obtain that is a vertex lattice the assertions idvl and id follow from the definitions of and for a lattice l in lq and an integer r z 0 we set l r l l r l proposition 5 21 for a special lattice l in lq set l r l l r for r z 0 there is an integer d 0 1 2 such that l l 1 ld ld 1 and li li 1 is of length 1 for 0 i d moreover l ld l q is a vertex lattice of type 2 d 1 and l l l q to prove proposition 5 21 we use the following lemma 5 22 if l is a special lattice in lq then we have l l l p 1 y 1 w proof let l be a special lattice in lq taking the duals it suffices to show l l l l q y 1 w first take v l l then we have v l and thus we obtain v v 2 l q and v v 2 l l q y 1 w here we use the assumption that l is special hence we obtain v v v 2 v v 2 l q y 1 w next take v l l q y 1 w with v w ay 1 where w l q and a w since l is special we have y 1 l therefore we obtain w l l q l l which concludes v l l proof of proposition 5 21 first we have lengthw l 0 l 1 by p 1 y 1 6 l and lemma 5 22 by hp 14 proposition 2 19 there is the minimum integer d 1 2 3 such that l d is stable note that p 1 y 1 l d if d 3 since y 1 l d pl d we have lengthw l r lr 1 lengthw l r l r 1 1 the supersingular locus 29 for any r z 0 by lemma 5 22 and hp 14 proposition 2 19 on the other hand we have an equality for r z 0 3 lengthw l r l r lengthw l r l r 1 lengthw l r lr 1 lengthw l r 1 l r 1 first assume p 1 y 1 6 l d hence d 2 we claim that d is the minimum integer among r z 0 such that lr is stable the stability of ld follows from the equality ld l d p 1 y 1 w which is a consequence of lemma 5 22 next if 0 r d then we prove that lr 1 lr by the assumption p 1 y 1 6 l d we have lengthw lr l r lengthw lr 1 l r 1 1 by lemma 5 22 on the other hand we have lengthw l r l r 1 1 by the minimality of d therefore we obtain lengthw l r lr 1 1 by 3 next assume p 1 y 1 l d we claim that d 1 is the minimum integer among r z 0 such that lr is stable let r 0 be the minimum integer among r z 0 such that p 1 y 1 l r then 1 r 0 d therefore we have lengthw l r l r 1 1 for 1 r r 0 on the other hand by the definition of r 0 and lemma 5 22 we have lengthw l r 0 l r 0 0 and lengthw l r l r 1 for 0 r r 0 1 combining them with the formula 3 for r 1 r 0 we obtain l r 0 lr 0 1 and lengthw l r lr 1 1 for 1 r r 0 1 that is r 0 1 is the minimum integer among r z 0 such that lr is stable hence it suffices to show r 0 d now suppose r 0 d then we have p 1 y 1 l d 1 which concludes l d 1 ld 1 by using the formula 3 for r d we obtain lengthw l d l d 1 lengthw l d ld 1 since lr 0 is invariant we have ld lr 0 ld 1 consequently the left hand side is 0 which contradicts the assumption of d hence we have r 0 d 5 3 bruhat tits stratification first we recall the closed formal subschemem h ofmh attached to an h vertex lattice it is defined as the locus of x such that 1 end x moreover putm i h m h m i h we define closed formal subschemes ofmg by the same manner definition 5 23 let vl be a vertex lattice we define a closed formal subschmemg ofmg as the locus of x with 1 end x for i z we setm i g mg m i g the bijection in proposition 5 6 induces a bijection as follows pz mg fp l special lattice in lq l l special lattice in lq l proposition 5 24 let vl i we have mg mh ii we have m i g m i h for any i z proof i by proposition 3 3 mg is the locus of x inmh such that 1 y 1 end x and 1 end x this is equivalent to the condition 1 end x since zpy 1 ii this follows from i andm i g m i h corollary 5 25 let vl i the formal scheme mg is a reduced scheme of characteristic p ii we have the following if vl 1 then m 0 g is a single point 30 y oki if vl 3 then m 0 g is isomorphic to p 1 fp if vl 5 then m 0 g is isomorphic to the fermat surface defined by x p 1 0 x p 1 1 x p 1 2 x p 1 3 0 in projfp x 0 x 1 x 2 x 3 in particular m i g is projective smooth and irreducible of dimension t 1 2 for any i z proof i by proposition 5 24 i it suffices to show thatmh is reduced this follows from theorem b 1 ii by propositions 2 15 ii and 5 24 ii it suffices to show thatm 0 h is projective smooth and irreducible of dimension t 1 2 this follows from hp 14 theorem 3 10 theorem 5 26 let 1 2 vl i we have mg 1 mg 2 mg 1 2 if 1 2 vl otherwise ii we have mg 1 mg 2 if and only if 1 2 proof i we follow the proof of rtw 14 proposition 4 3 ii for s nilpw and x mg s we have 1 1 2 1 1 2 end x if and only 1 i end x for i 1 2 therefore if 1 2 vl then we have mg 1 mg 2 mg 1 2 next assume mg 1 mg 2 6 then there is a special lattice l such that l mg 1 mg 2 fp we have l 1 2 and therefore p 1 2 1 2 1 2 l l 1 2 that is 1 2 vl ii by definition we havemg 1 mg 2 if 1 2 on the other hand assumemg 1 mg 2 by i we have 1 2 vl and mg 1 2 mg 1 6 hence it suffices to show the equality 1 2 1 we have t 1 2 1 2 dimmg 1 2 dimmg 1 t 1 1 2 by corollary 5 25 ii hence we have t 1 2 t 1 since 1 2 1 we obtain the desired equality let us define a locally closed subscheme ofmg attached to vl by btg mg mg then we have a bijection as follows by proposition 5 21 pz btg fp l special lattice in l q l we set bt i g btg m i g for each i z theorem 5 27 i we have a locally closed stratification m 0 redg vl bt 0 g each bt 0 g is irreducible of dimension t 1 2 the supersingular locus 31 ii for any vl the closure of bt 0 g in m 0 g equals m 0 g bt 0 g iii the scheme m 0 redg is connected iv let irr m 0 g be the set of all irreducible components ofm 0 g then we have a bijection vl 5 irr m 0 g 7 m 0 g in particular m 0 g is purely 2 dimensional the stratification in theorem 5 27 i is called the bruhat tits stratification of mg proof i this follows from proposition 5 21 and corollary 5 25 ii ii this follows from the irreducibility of corollary 5 25 ii iii this follows from the same argument as that of hp 17 theorem 6 4 1 here we use proposition 5 17 iv by i and proposition 5 12 i we have an equality of underlying sets m 0 redg vl 5 mg hence m 0 g is an irreducible component of m 0 g and the map 7 m 0 g is surjective on the other hand the injectivity of the map follows from theorem 5 26 ii we further consider the geometric structure of mg let mnfsg be the non formally smooth locus of mg over spfw and setm 0 nfsg mnfsg m 0 g theorem 5 28 there is an equality m 0 nfsg vl 1 m 0 g proof note that corollary 4 2 implies that for any non formally smooth point x m 0 g is fp rational and the corresponding stable dieudonne lattice m satisfies y 1 m f 1 pm this is equivalent to the condition y 11 f m m indeed the equivalence above follows from dimfp m y 1 m 4 dimfp m pf 1 m here the second equality is a consequence of the kottwitz condition moreover if l is the special lattice corresponding to m then the condition y 11 f m m is translated into l l by proposition 5 7 first take vl 1 and writem 0 g fp l where l is a special lattice in lq then we have l l and l m 1 g fp p z mg fp by proposition 5 7 moreover we have l l m 0 g fp p z mg fp by lemma 3 11 iv and proposition 5 7 on the other hand m 0 g fp consists of a single point by corollary 5 25 ii hence we obtain l l that is m 0 g m 0 nfs g note that the disjointness of the right hand side follows from theorem 5 26 ii next take a special lattice l in lq which corresponds to a point inm 0 nfsg then we have l l which implies that l 0 l l is invariant since 2 idlq hence we have l 0 vl 1 and m 0 g l 0 x corollary 5 29 i each non formally smooth point of m 0 g is contained in 2 p 1 irreducible components 32 y oki ii each irreducible component of m 0 g contains p 1 p 2 1 non formally smooth points iii for each irreducible component f of m 0 g the number of irreducible components of m 0 g such that the intersections with f are 1 dimensional is p 1 p 2 1 iv for each irreducible component f of m 0 g the number of irreducible components of m 0 g which intersect at a single point is p p 1 p 2 1 proof i this is a consequence of propositions 5 12 i 5 26 ii and theorem 5 28 ii this follows from propositions 5 12 iii 5 26 ii and theorem 5 28 iii this is a consequence of propositions 5 12 iii iv and 5 26 iv this follows from propositions 5 12 iii v and 5 26 remark 5 30 i we can count numbers as in corollary 5 29 form 0 h by the same method ii we modify the number of irreducible components ofm 0 h which intersects at a single point for each irreducible component of m 0 h asserted in hp 14 theorem 3 12 1 the precise value is p p 2 1 p 3 1 this follows from the analogue of proposition 5 12 v and the fact that each irreducible component ofm 0 h contains p 2 1 p 3 1 superspecial points here a superspecial point is an element ofmh fp such that the corresponding dieudonne lattice m in dq satisfies f 2 m pm we write vertex lattices in terms of the bruhat tits building define a simplicial complex v with an action of so l q as follows the set of vertices in v is the set vl 1 vl 5 the adjacency relation is given as below for distinct vl 1 vl 5 if t 1 and t 5 then if if t t 5 then if lengthw 1 and lengthw 1 for m 0 1 2 an m simplex is a subset of m 1 vertex lattices 0 m which are mutually adjacent so l q qp acts simplicially on v by so l q vl 1 vl 5 vl 1 vl 5 g 7 g proposition 5 31 there is a bijection between the set vl 3 and the set of edges connecting two adjacent vertex lattices of type 5 that is the set of 1 simplexes 1 2 such that 1 2 vl 5 proof for a 1 simplex 1 2 with i vl 5 for i 1 2 we show that 1 2 vl 3 for i 1 2 since i vl 5 we have i p i hence we have p 1 2 p 1 2 p 1 p 2 1 2 on the other hand since 1 and 2 are adjacent we have p 1 2 1 2 hence we obtain 1 2 vl moreover the adjacency relation for 1 and 2 also implies that 1 2 vl 3 therefore we obtain a map 1 2 1 simplex 1 2 vl 5 vl 3 1 2 7 1 2 the bijectivity of the map above follows from proposition 5 12 i we can also prove the assertion as below which follows from the same argument as the proof of hp 14 proposition 2 22 by using propositions 3 13 iii and 5 31 see also gar 97 20 3 proposition 5 32 there is an so l q equivariant isomorphism between the simplicial complex v and the bruhat tits building of so l q the supersingular locus 33 5 4 bruhat tits building of jad qp and bruhat tits strata we interpret the simplicial complex v by the isomorphism jad so l q constructed in corollary 3 19 first we recall the bruhat tits building of jad qp pgsp 4 qp see also gar 97 20 1 and fan 11 chapter 2 we use the 4 dimensional symplectic space v 0 0 over qp constructed in section 2 3 see definition 2 7 for a lattice t in v 0 let t be the homothety class of lattices in v 0 containing t we define a simplicial complex b as follows the set of vertices consists of sets of lattices in v 0 such that there is necessarily unique t satisfying the conditions as follows t t pt t t we denote by vert the set of all vertices the adjacency relation on the set of vertices is defined as follows for vertices 1 2 we have 1 2 if there are lattices t 1 t 2 in v 0 such that ti i and pti t i ti for i 1 2 t 1 t 2 or t 2 t 1 for m 0 1 2 an m simplex is a subset of m 1 vertices 0 m which are mutually adjacent the group j qp gsp v 0 qp acts simplicially on b by j qp vert vert g 7 g gt t since the action of the center of j qp is trivial the action of j qp factors through j ad qp for a vertex of b put t dimfp t t z where t is the unique lattice in v 0 satisfying pt t t note that the number t is independent of the choice of t and we have t 0 2 4 we call t the type of definition 5 33 i for t 0 2 4 we denote by vert t the set of all vertices of b satisfying t t ii put verths vert 0 vert 4 an element of verths is called a hyperspecial vertex iii put vertns vert 2 an element of vertns is called a non special vertex iv let edgehs be the set of all edges connecting two adjacent hyperspecial vertices that is 1 simplexes 0 2 where i vert 2 i for i 0 2 remark 5 34 i let vert and t then we have t if and only if verths if verths then we have t t ii there is an isomorphism of simplicial complexes between the bruhat tits building of sp 4 qp and b with sp v 0 qp actions by sending t to t t cf gar 97 20 1 iii let g jad qp satisfying ordp sim g z 2 z and t a lattice in v 0 satisfying pt t t and dimfp t t 2 then the homothety class gt does not contain a lattice t in v 0 such that pt t t however gt contains such a lattice we further consider the lattices in v 0 definition 5 35 we define a subgroup j 0 of j qp by j 0 g j qp sim g z p proposition 5 36 let t 0 be a self dual lattice in v 0 and t 1 a lattice in v 0 satisfying pt 1 t 1 t 1 that is dimfp t t 2 i for any lattice t in v 0 satisfying t pit for some i z there is an element g j qp such that t g t 0 ii let i z and t a lattice in v 0 satisfying t pit then we have an equality g t g j 0 t lattice in v 0 t pit 34 y oki iii for a lattice t in v 0 satisfying pt t t there is an element g j 0 such that t g t 1 to prove proposition 5 36 let us define an algebraic group jzp over zp as jzp r g c glr t 0 zp r gm r g v g w c v w for all v w v zp r for any zp algebra r then we have jzp zp qp j and jzp gsp 4 zzp we endow t 0 fp t 0 zp fp with the non degenerate symplectic form 0 mod p over fp lemma 5 37 the group jzp fp acts transitively on the set of isotropic lines in t 0 fp proof these follow from wil 00 3 5 4 lemma 5 38 for n z 0 the canonical homomorphism gsp 2 n zp gsp 2 n fp is surjective proof the algebraic group gsp 2 n zzp is smooth over zp hence the assertion follows from fu 15 proposition 2 8 13 proof of proposition 5 36 i this is a consequence of kot 92 corollary 7 3 ii first note that gt for g j 0 satisfies gt pigt since gt pigt 0 sim g t p it 0 t p it 0 zp on the other hand take a lattice t in v 0 satisfying t pit by i there is an element g j qp such that t gt then we have zp t pit 0 gt p igt 0 sim g t p it 0 sim g zp consequently we have sim g z p that is g j 0 iii take a lattice t in v 0 satisfying pt t t then there is a self dual lattice t in v 0 such that t t p 1 t we have dimfp pt pt dimfp t t 1 let us fix t as above by ii there is an element g 0 j 0 such that t g 0 t 0 then we have t 0 g 10 t p 1 t 0 hence there is an element g jzp fp such that g 10 pt pt 0 g pt 1 pt 0 by lemma 5 37 furthermore by lemma 5 38 there is g jzp zp such that g mod p g then we have g 10 t gt 1 that is t g 0 g t 1 now we give a reinterpretation of the bruhat tits stratification ofm 0 g proposition 5 39 there is an isomorphism of simplicial complexes b v which commutes with the actions of jad qp so l q qp moreover induces correspondences as follow i the set verths corresponds to the set vl 5 ii the set edgehs corresponds to the set vl 3 iii the set vertns corresponds to the set vl 1 proof by proposition 5 32 and the isomorphism jad so l q there is a jad qp equivariant isomor phism of simplicial complexes b v by the same argument as hp 14 3 6 the assertions i and ii follows since preserves the adjacent relations by definition we obtain the assertion iii by proposition 5 39 we can restate the bruhat tits stratification by means of b put ve verths vertns edgehs note that we have a bijection ve vl by proposition 5 39 we define an order on ve as follows for x y ve if x y vert then x y if x vertns y verths and they are adjacent if x vert and y edgehs then x y if x vertns and x y is a 2 simplex the supersingular locus 35 if x edgehs and y vert then x y if y x the following follows from the definition of proposition 5 40 the bijection induces an isomorphism ve vl of ordered sets definition 5 41 for x ve put mg x mg x btg x btg x m 0 g x m 0 g x bt 0 g x bt 0 g x see definition 5 23 for the definition ofmg x the following is a restatement of the results in the previous section theorem 5 42 i for x y ve we have mg x mg y if and only if x y ii for x ve we have the following if x vertns then m 0 g x is a single fp rational point if x edgehs then m 0 g x is isomorphic to p 1 fp if x verths then m 0 g x is isomorphic to the fermat surface defined by x p 1 0 x p 1 1 x p 1 2 x p 1 3 0 in projfp x 0 x 1 x 2 x 3 in particular m 0 g x is projective smooth and irreducible iii put bt 0 g x btg x m 0 g for x ve then we have a locally closed stratification m 0 redg x ve bt 0 g x we also call the equality above the bruhat tits stratification in particular m 0 redg is connected and is purely 2 dimensional iv there is an equality m 0 nfsg x vertns m 0 g x v for distinct x y verths the following hold if x y is a 2 simplex then m 0 g x m 0 g y m 0 g x y if x y are not adjacent and there is necessarily unique z vertns such that x z z y are 2 simplexes then m 0 g x m 0 g y m 0 g z if x y do not satisfy the above two conditions then m 0 g x m 0 g y proof i this follows from theorem 5 26 ii and proposition 5 40 ii this follows from corollary 5 25 ii and proposition 5 40 note that we can also prove the connectedness ofm 0 g and the assertion on the dimension ofmg by the bruhat tits stratification and the connectedness of b iii this follows from theorem 5 27 i ii and proposition 5 40 iv this follows from theorem 5 28 and proposition 5 39 iii v this follows from theorem 5 26 i and proposition 5 40 finally we consider the j qp action onmredg proposition 5 43 36 y oki i let irr mredg be the set of all irreducible components of mredg and take i vert 2 i for i 0 2 then m 0 g 0 m 0 g 2 is a set of complete representatives of j qp irr m red g in particular we have j qp irr mredg 2 ii the group j qp acts transitively on the set mnfsg proof i take two irreducible components f 1 f 2 ofmredg for i 1 2 if fi m ni g for some ni z then g nip fi is an irreducible component of m 0 red g hence we may assume fi m 0 red g now write fi m 0 g i where i verths take ti i satisfying pti t i ti then f 1 and f 2 are in the same orbit if and only if there is g j 0 such that g 1 2 which is equivalent to gt 1 t 2 therefore the assertion follows from proposition 5 36 ii ii by theorem 5 42 iv we have an j 0 qp equivariant isomorphismm 0 nfsg vert ns hence the assertion follows from proposition 5 36 iii remark 5 44 the finiteness of j qp irr mredg is already obtained by mie 20 proposition 2 8 the orem 1 1 6 deligne lusztig varieties and bruhat tits stratification in this section we relate the bruhat tits strata with some deligne lusztig varieties 6 1 generalized deligne lusztig varieties for odd special orthogonal groups let g 0 be a split reductive group over fp fix a split maximal torus t 0 of g 0 and a borel subgroup b 0 containing t 0 put g g 0 fp fp t t 0 fp fp and b b 0 fp fp we denote the frobenius of g by let w be the weyl group and 1 n be the simple roots corresponding to t b let si s i w be the simple reflection corresponding to i for i let wi be the subgroup of w generated by si w i i and pi bwib the corresponding parabolic subgroup then we have an equality g w wi w wi piwpi hence we obtain the relative position map inv g pi g pi wi w wi by the composite of g pi g pi pi g pi defined by g 1 g 2 7 g 11 g 2 and the bijection pi g pi wi w wi coming from the equality above definition 6 1 for i and w wi w wi we define a generalized deligne lusztig variety as a locally closed subscheme of g pi which is defined by xpi w g g pi inv g g w we keep the notations above we consider the case where g 0 is an odd special orthogonal group see also wu 16 example 4 1 3 let m z 0 and 0 a 2 m 1 dimensional quadratic space over fp definition 6 2 a basis e 1 e 2 m 1 of 0 is elementary if em 1 is anisotropic and ei ej 1 if i j 2 m 2 and i 6 m 1 0 otherwise by shi 10 lemma 22 3 there is an elementary basis of 0 we fix such a basis e 1 e 2 m 1 of 0 put g 0 so 0 which is a split reductive group over fp we regard a subgroup of gl 2 m 1 by the basis e 1 e 2 m 1 let t 0 g 0 be the diagonal torus and b 0 g 0 the upper triangular borel subgroup then the weyl group w can be identified with the subgroup of the symmetric group s 2 m 1 w w s 2 m 1 w i w 2 m 2 i 2 m 2 for any i 1 2 m 1 the set of all simple reflections in w t is s 1 sm where the supersingular locus 37 si i i 1 2 m 1 i 2 m 2 i for 1 i m 1 sm m m 2 for 0 i m we define wi sm sm 1 i then we have w 0 id and wm is a coxeter element moreover for 0 i m 1 let ii 1 m 1 i wi wii and pi bwib the corresponding parabolic subgroup then we have pm 1 b we put pm b by convention moreover g p 0 is isomorphic to the grassmanian of all totally isotropic subspaces of dimension m of 0 fp fp now we put id 0 we introduce the following notation we also use it in section 6 2 definition 6 3 let f n n be a linear isomorphism and r an fp algebra for a r submodule n of n fp r we denote by f n the r submodule of n fp r generated by f n note that it is locally free of rank rankr n if n is locally free let us consider the closed subscheme of g p 0 as below s 0 l g p 0 rank l l m 1 the following follows from hlz 19 corollary 2 4 6 and the isomorphism x i wi xj wi in the proof of hlz 19 proposition 2 5 1 for g j l bn s sn s 1 sn in hlz 19 table 1 proposition 6 4 there is a locally closed stratification of s 0 s 0 m i 0 xpi wi moreover for 0 i m the closure of xpi wi in s 0 equals i j xpi wj proposition 6 5 the schemes xb wm and s 0 are irreducible of dimension m proof we have dimxpi wi i and xb wm is irreducible by hp 14 proposition 3 2 by proposition 6 4 xb wm is dense in s 0 which concludes the irreducibility of s 0 6 2 relation with the case for non split even orthogonal groups let 0 be a 2 m 2 dimensional non split quadratic space over fp furthermore put 0 fp fp and id 0 for d m m 1 let ogr d be the moduli space of totally isotropic subspaces of rank d of over fp on the other hand let ogr m m 1 be the moduli space which parametrizes flags of os submodules lm lm 1 of fp os such that li is locally free of rank i for i m m 1 for any fp scheme s the scheme ogr m m 1 has exactly two connected components denote by ogr m m 1 the connected components of ogr m m 1 moreover put s 0 l ogr m 1 0 rank l l m we have a closed immersion i 0 s 0 ogr m m 1 l 7 l l l moreover put s 0 s 0 ogr m m 1 the schemes s 0 equal the schemes x for d m 1 in the sense of hp 14 3 2 hence we have the following proposition 6 6 hp 14 proposition 3 6 the schemes s 0 are projective smooth and irreducible of dimension m 38 y oki we relate s 0 with s 0 fix an anisotropic vector 0 and let be the reflection with respect to set 0 0 it is a 2 m 1 dimensional quadratic space over fp we endow ogr d for d m m 1 and s 0 with an fp structure defined by l 7 l moreover we endow ogr m m 1 0 with an fp structure defined by lm lm 1 7 lm lm 1 then i 0 commutes with the fp structures proposition 6 7 i we have ogr m m 1 ogr m m 1 and s 0 s 0 ii for a reduced fp algebra r of finite type and l ogr m 1 0 r we have l l fpr moreover l l is totally isotropic and locally free of rank m over r therefore we obtain the morphism q ogr m 1 0 g p 0 l 7 l l over fp moreover q commutes with fp structures iii the morphism q induces an isomorphism s 0 s 0 which commutes with the fp structures proof i first we prove ogr m m 1 ogr m m 1 fix an elementary basis e 1 e 2 m 1 of 0 and put c e 2 m 1 e 2 m 1 1 note that 6 0 since is anisotropic then we have c f p f p 2 since 0 is non split fix a square root f p 2 of c then we have now fix a p 1 th root a f p 2 of 2 e m 1 e m 1 1 this is possible since f p 2 is a cyclic group of order p 2 1 and f p p 1 and define ei and fi for 1 i m 1 as follow ei e i if 1 i m a e m 1 if i m 1 fi e 2 m 2 i if 1 i m ap e m 1 if i m 1 then we have the following ei fj ij i j 1 m 1 ei ei if 1 i m fm 1 if i m 1 fi fi if 1 i m em 1 if i m 1 ei ei if 1 i m fm 1 if i m 1 we define subspaces of as below l m i 1 fpei l l em 1 l l fm 1 then we have l l ogr m m 1 fp moreover by after hp 14 lemma 3 4 after relabeling the connected components of ogr m m 1 if necessary we may assume l l ogr m m 1 fp on the other hand we have l l l l by the relations between ei fj and hence we obtain ogr m m 1 ogr m m 1 by the connectedness of ogr m m 1 second we prove s 0 s 0 this follows from ogr m m 1 ogr m m 1 and the commutativity of and ii note that we have l 6 fp r by the similar argument to the proof of lemma 5 22 we have l l l l where l and l are the and fixed parts in l respectively then we have l r and both l and l are totally isotropic let us show that l is locally free of rank m over r and l 0 first suppose r fp then l 0 follows since is anisotropic hence we have dim fp l dim fp l l by the similar argument to the proof of lemma 5 22 we have the supersingular locus 39 dimfp l l m which implies the assertion next for general r the assertion follows from the case for r fp lan 02 exercise x 16 for id fp r and the property that r is a jacobson ring finally the commutativity of q and fp structures is a consequence of the commutativity of and iii first note that q s 0 commutes with the fp structures by i and ii we show that q s 0 are closed immersions by ii we have a morphism i s 0 ogr m m 1 l 7 l l l which is injective as a functor it is a closed immersion since both s 0 and ogr m m 1 are proper see proposition 6 6 relabeling if necessary we may assume i s 0 ogr m m 1 moreover we have isomorphisms c ogr m m 1 ogr m lm lm 1 7 lm by after hp 14 lemma 3 4 moreover by ii c i s 0 factor as s 0 q g p 0 ogr m hence the assertion follows next we show that q s 0 factors through the closed immersion s 0 g p 0 take a reduced fp algebra r of finite type and l s 0 r by ii we have l l g p 0 r on the other hand since l l is locally free over r l l l l l l l l is also locally free over r by the injectivity of and lan 02 exercise x 16 for id fp r moreover by the same argument as in the proof of ii we have rank l l l l m if l l fp r m 1 otherwise hence the assertion follows finally we show that q s 0 s 0 s 0 are isomorphisms by propositions 6 4 i 6 5 and 6 6 both s 0 and s 0 are integral of dimension m therefore the assertion follows 6 3 some lower dimensional cases we describe s 0 for m 0 1 and 2 case 1 m 0 in this case s 0 is a single point defined over fp case 2 m 1 by definition we have p 0 p 1 b and s 0 g b p 1 fp the set of all fp rational points corresponds to xb id in s 0 and the complement corresponds to xp 0 w 1 in s 0 moreover by the identity of dynkin diagrams b 1 a 1 there is a surjection gl 2 so such that the upper triangular borel subgroup b of gl 2 surjects onto b let w be the unique non trivial element of the weyl group of b t where t is the diagonal torus then we have xb id xb id and xb w 1 xb w case 3 m 2 by definition we have p 0 6 p 1 b consider the 4 dimensional symplectic space v 0 over fp and denote by gsp v 0 as the symplectic similitude group of v 0 then gsp v 0 is an algebraic group over fp which is isomorphic to gsp 4 by the identity of dynkin diagrams b 2 c 2 we have a surjection gsp 4 so 0 such that the klingen parabolic subgroup p of gsp v 0 surjects onto p 0 this induces an isomorphism s 0 l p v 0 l l the right hand side is isomorphic to the surface defined by 4 x 0 x p 3 x p 0 x 3 x 1 x p 2 x p 1 x 2 0 40 y oki in projfp x 0 x 1 x 2 x 3 note that proposition 6 7 ii gives an fp isomorphism however not defined over fp between 4 and the fermat surface defined by x p 1 0 x p 1 1 x p 1 2 x p 1 3 0 in projfp x 0 x 1 x 2 x 3 let b be the upper triangular borel subgroup of gsp v 0 the weyl group can be identified with a subgroup of the symmetric group s 4 w s 4 w i w 5 i 5 for any i 1 4 denote s 1 by the simple reflection which corresponds to 1 2 3 4 also denote s 2 by the simple reflection which corresponds to 2 3 then we have xp id xp 0 id xb s 1 xp 0 w 1 and xb s 1 s 2 xp 0 w 2 6 4 relation with the bruhat tits strata of mg in this subsection we relate the bruhat tits stratification with deligne lusztig varieties by using the results in the previous subsections definition 6 8 for vlh put 0 it is a fp vector space we endow 0 with quadratic form v 7 p 2 q v mod p we apply the results in section 6 2 to 0 0 and p 1 y 1 then we have on 0 and 0 is isomorphic to the quadratic space 0 cf definition 5 13 moreover we have mod on 0 fp fp and 0 fp fp the following follow from hp 14 theorem 3 9 and propositions 5 24 6 7 ii theorem 6 9 i there is an isomorphism m 0 g s 0 which commutes with the bijection in proposition 5 6 ii the isomorphism in i induces an isomorphism xpi wi vl 2 i 1 bt 0 g for any 0 i t 1 2 in particular the dense open subscheme bt 0 g of m 0 g is isomorphic to the deligne lusztig variety for sot associated with a coxeter element proof i this is a consequence of propositions 5 23 ii 6 7 ii and hp 14 theorem 3 9 ii this follows from the same argument as in the proof of hp 14 theorem 3 11 combining theorem 6 9 with proposition 5 40 and the results in section 6 3 we obtain the following corollary 6 10 let x ve then bt 0 g x is isomorphic to the deligne lusztig variety for gsp 2 d x associated with a coxeter element where d x 2 if x verths 1 if x edgehs 0 if x vertns 7 application to some shimura varieties in this section we apply results for mg to the shimura varieties for quaternionic unitary groups of degree 2 first we review integral models of such shimura varieties cf rz 96 chapter 6 next we recall the definition of the supersingular locus and study the non smooth locus of the integral model by using the local model finally we show the global results by using the p adic uniformization theorem and the results formg the supersingular locus 41 7 1 integral models of shimura varieties for quaternionic unitary groups let d be an in definite quaternion algebra over q which is ramified at p define a set ram d as the set of all prime numbers which ramifies in d note that ram d is a finite set and 2 ram d lemma 7 1 there are two elements e q satisfying the following conditions d q where 2 2 e and ordp 1 and ordp e 0 e 0 proof since d is ramified at p there are e q satisfying the first condition and ordp 1 ordp e 0 1 if ordp 1 then we can replace e to 1 e and hence we may assume ordp e 0 next if 0 then we have e 0 since d is indefinite moreover we may replace to e 0 since e nq e q q e therefore we may assume 0 finally if e 0 then by 0 there is an element n q q q such that 0 and ordp 0 therefore we can replace e to e 0 let us fix e q as in lemma 7 1 let be the involution of d defined by d d 1 it is a positive involution by the assumption on and mum 70 21 theorem 2 let od be an order of d which is stable under and od z zp is a maximal order of d q qp put v d 2 as a left d module and let be a bilinear form on v defined by x 1 x 2 y 1 y 2 trdd q 1 x 1 y 2 x 2 y 1 for x 1 x 2 y 1 y 2 v then is a non degenerate symplectic form satisfying the following condi tions dx y x d y for any d d and x y v let 0 o 2 d v be a z lattice then 0 z z p 0 z z p these follow from the same argument as in the proof of lemma 2 1 by the definition of the lattice chain n 0 z z p n z in v is self dual let g be the algebraic group over q defined by g r g c gld qr v q r gm r g v g w c v w for all v w v q r for any q algebra r by corollary 2 3 ii there are isomorphisms g gu 2 d g q qp gu 2 d g q r gsp 4 zr let h resc rgm g q r be homomorphism induced by resc rgm gsp 4 zr a b 1 7 ae 2 be 2 be 2 ae 2 and an isomorphismg qr gsp 4 zr we denote byx theg r conjugacy class of hom resc rgm g q r containing h as above then we obtain a shimura datum g x the reflex field of g x is q moreover we can construct a cocharacter gm g q c of g over c from h see rz 96 6 2 finally let kp g ap f be a compact open subgroup which is contained in the congruence subgroup of level n 3 where n is prime to p consequently we obtain a datum d od v n 0 z z p n z kp and hence we can define an integral model over zp as in rz 96 definition 6 9 which is denoted by sk here k kpkp and kp is the stabilizer of 0 z zp in g q qp it is defined as the functor which parametrizes tuples a p for any connected noetherian zp scheme s where a is an abelian scheme of dimension 4 over s od z z p end a z z p is a ring homomorphism 42 y oki a a is a prime to p quasi polarization p is a kp level structure that is a 1 s s invariant kp orbit of an od linear isomorphism p h 1 as a p f v q apf which respects the symplectic forms up to a constant in a p f here h 1 as a p f 6 p t as z q and s is a geometric point of s see kot 92 5 satisfying the following conditions for any d od det t d lie a t 2 trdd q d t nrdd q d 2 d d two tuples a 1 1 1 p 1 and a 2 2 2 p 2 are equivalent if there is a prime to p quasi isogeny a 1 a 2 such that 2 1 and p 2 h 1 a p f p 1 the functor above is representable by a quasi projective scheme over z p by geometric invariant theory see kot 92 5 remark 7 2 let us explain a symplectic form on h 1 a a p f for a polarized abelian variety a over an algebraically closed field of characteristic p choose an isomorphism a p f 1 apf for any prime 6 p the polarization induces a homomorphism t a t a which induces a weil pairing t a t a z 1 using this we obtain a symplectic form over a p f h 1 a a p f h 1 a apf a p f 1 af we endow h 1 a a p f with symplectic form as above 7 2 supersingular loci and non smooth loci of the integral models in this section we define the supersingular locus of the integral model sk and consider the non smooth locus of sk w sk speczp specw in this subsection we regard dq v qp k 0 as an isocrystal over fp by the linear map f b let s ssk be the supersingular locus of sk that is the reduced closed subscheme of sk fp sk specz p specfp such that s ss k k a p sk k a is supersingular for any algebraically closed field k of characteristic p let s ssk be the completion of sk w along s ss k we also define the basic locus s basick of sk fp to be the closed subscheme of sk fp such that s basic k k a p sk k d a p q is basic see kot 85 5 1 for any algebraically closed field k of characteristic p now consider the datum below d d q qp od z zp v q qp n 0 z zp n z since d is ramified at p we have an isomorphismd qqp d over qp by the skolem noether theorem we may take an isomorphism such that d maps to an element of qp 2 we identify d q qp and d by the isomorphism above then we may assume that qp 2 in section 1 1 is an element above in this case under the isomorphism d qqp d the involution defined in section 7 1 equals the one defined in section 1 1 moreover we have c for some c z p 2 lemma 7 3 there is a d linear isometry of symplectic spaces over qp v q qp v satisfying 0 z zp 0 the supersingular locus 43 proof let v q qp v x 1 x 2 a 7 ax 1 c 1 ax 2 then f is a d linear isomorphism moreover we have x 1 x 2 y 1 y 2 trdd qp 1 x 1 c 1 y 2 x 2 y 1 c 1 trdd qp c 1 1 x 1 y 2 x 2 y 1 x 1 x 2 y 1 y 2 for x 1 x 2 y 1 y 2 v the assertion 0 z zp 0 follows from the definition of by the isometry above we obtain the following the cocharacter obtained by h is identical to that of section 2 1 the lattice chain n 0 z zp n z in v q qp equals n 0 n z therefore under the isomorphism d qqp qp and the isometry the datum d equal the rapoport zink datum d defined in section 2 1 proposition 7 4 we have an equality s basick s ss k proof we follow the proof of hp 17 lemma 4 2 4 let i g glqp v be the standard representation then it suffices to prove that b is basic if and only if b is so this follows from that the center of g equals gm which is identified with the scalar matrices by i theorem 7 5 i the scheme sk w is regular and flat over w ii let s nsmk w be the set of non smooth points in sk w then s nsm k w is the finite set of all fp rational points such that 0 on lie a iii let s ssk nfs be the set of non formally smooth points in s ssk then we have an equality s nsm k w s ssk nfs proof by hai 05 theorem 6 4 and theorem 4 1 the following hold sk w is flat over specw and regular sk w specw speck 0 is smooth over speck 0 x s nsmk w corresponds to an object a p sk fp such that 0 on lie a more over there is an isomorphism between the complete local ring of x sk w andw t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 p therefore i and ii follow let us show iii in the sequel we must show that s nsmk s ssk fp take a p s nsmk it suffices to show that d a p q is isoclinic of slope 1 2 put n d a p q and m d a p then m is a w lattice in n which is stable under od f and pf 1 furthermore we have an isomorphism lie a m pf 1 m using the assumption that 0 on m pf 1 m we have f m m cf the proof of theorem 5 28 hence we obtain f 2 m pm which means that n is isoclinic of slope 1 2 by above x s ssk belongs to s nsmk if and only if the complete local ring of s ssk w at x is not formally smooth over w which is equivalent to x s ssk nfs proposition 7 6 the supersingular locus s ssk is non empty to prove proposition 7 6 we need a comparison between sk and the integral model of shk g x considered in kmps to explain more precisely let g be the symplectic similitude group of v regarded as a symplectic space over q then there is an isomorphism g gsp 8 zq we denote by i g g be the canonical injection and let x the g r conjugacy class of i h then g x is the shimura datum whose reflex is q moreover we obtain an embedding of shimura datum i g x g x 44 y oki for a compact open subgroup k p of g a p f let s k p be the z p scheme defined as the functor which parametrizes equivalence classes of triples a p where a is an abelian scheme over s a a is a prime to p quasi polarization p is a k p level structure that is a 1 s s invariant k p orbit of an isomorphism p h 1 as a p f v q apf which respects the symplectic forms up to a constant in a p f here s is a geometric point of s we define the notion of equivalence on triples by the same manner as in the definition of sk proposition 7 7 there is an open compact subgroup k p of g ap f such that the canonical morphism sk s k p specz p speczp a p 7 a p is a closed immersion proof put skp lim kp skpkp and s lim k p sk p specz p speczp then skp is the moduli space of prime to p isogeny classes of the quadruples as in the case of sk except that instead of being p exactly an od linear isomorphism h 1 as a p f v q apf the similar moduli interpretation for s also holds it suffices to prove that the canonical morphism s i skp s induced by i is a closed immersion we may prove that s i is a proper monomorphism the properness follows from the valuative criterion by using the theory of ne ron models on the other hand the moduli descripstion implies that s i is a monomorphism hence the assertion follows fix kp and k p satisfying proposition 7 7 we denote by s kmpsk the integral model of shk g x with respect to i in the sense of kmps that is the normalization of the scheme theoretic closure of shk g x in s k corollary 7 8 i there is an isomorphism sk s kmpsk specz p speczp ii under the isomorphism in i s basick equals the basic locus in the sense of kmps proof the assertion i is a consequence of theorem 7 5 i and proposition 7 7 the assertion ii follows from the definitions of sk and s kmps k proof of proposition 7 6 by corollary 7 8 ii it suffices to prove that the basic locus of s kmpsk is non empty however this assertion is exactly the same as kmps theorem 1 3 13 2 7 3 proof of the global result we describe the scheme s ssk by using the results onmg and the p adic uniformization theorem to apply the p adic uniformization theorem for s ssk we need to show that s ss k equals s basic k s ss k is not empty and the hasse principle for g holds however the first assertion is proposition 7 4 the second assertion is proposition 7 6 moreover the last assertion is pointed out in kot 92 7 therefore we obtain the following theorem 7 9 rz 96 theorem 6 30 for a fixed a 0 0 0 p s ssk fp there is an isomorphism i q mg g apf k p s ssk of formal schemes over spfw here i is an algebraic group over q defined by i r g c end 0 od a 0 q r gm r g 0 g c 0 for any q algebra r the supersingular locus 45 note that i q r is anisotropic modulo center moreover for any prime number we have i q q g q q if 6 p j if p we regard i q as a subgroup of j qp g apf by the diagonal embedding putm i q g a p f kp note that i q g apf kp is a finite set and let g 1 gm is a set of complete representative of i q g ap f kp put i i q j qp gikpg 1 i then we have i q mg g apf k p m i 1 i mg gikp kp moreover if we regard i as a subgroup of j qp then the right hand side is of the form m i 1 i mg note that the group i is discrete cocompact modulo center and torsion free by the hypothesis on k p we compute the numbers of connected and irreducible components of s ssk and the set s nsm k w theorem 7 10 i there is an equality connected components of s ssk i q j 0 j qp g a p f kp see definition 5 35 for the definition of j 0 ii let kmax i be the stabilizer of a vertex x vert i for i 0 2 then there is an equality irreducible components of s ssk i q j qp kmax 0 g apf k p i q j qp kmax 2 g apf k p iii let kmin be the stabilizer of a vertex lattice x vertns then there is an equality s nsmk i q j qp kmin g a p f k p all numbers above are finite proof we follow the proof of vol 10 proposition 6 3 we have a decomposition 5 i mg ij 0 j qp i j 0 m 0 g for any i i we have m i 1 ij 0 j qp m i 1 i j qp j 0 m i 1 i j qp j 0 gikp kp i q j qp j 0 g apf k p sincem 0 g is connected by theorem 5 27 iii the assertion follows from 5 and theorem 7 9 ii by theorem 5 27 iii the number of irreducible components of i j 0 mg equals i j 0 verths by proposition 5 36 ii the latter number equals i j 0 j 0 kmax 0 i j 0 j 0 kmax 2 therefore the assertion follows from the same computation in i 5 and theorem 7 9 iii by theorems 5 28 and 7 5 iii the number of non formally smooth points in i j 0 mg equals i j 0 vertns by proposition 5 36 iii the latter number equals i j 0 j 0 kmin therefore the assertion follows from the same computation in i 5 and theorem 7 9 let i mg i mg be the canonical morphism for each i proposition 7 11 let x verths and i 1 m i the morphism i m 0 g x i m 0 g x is proper the scheme i m 0 g x is projective over specfp 46 y oki ii the morphism i m 0 g x i m 0 g x is birational proof i the scheme m 0 g x is projective over specfp by corollary 5 25 ii on the other hand i j 0 m 0 redg is separated over specfp since it is a closed subscheme of sk fp which is quasi projective over specfp hence i is proper consequently i m 0 g x is proper over specfp and hence it is a closed subscheme of s k fp which quasi projective over specfp therefore the assertion follows ii the set y vertns y x is finite by propositions 5 12 iii and 5 39 i ii the scheme m 0 redg y consists of single fp rational point for y vert ns by proposition 5 39 i and corollary 5 25 ii hence y vertns y xm 0 g y is a finite set put u m 0 g x y vertns y x m 0 g y we claim that u u for i j 0 since stabj 0 x is compact and i is discrete stabj 0 x i is finite moreover we have stabj 0 x i id since i is torsion free now take i j 0 id since x and x have the same type theorem 5 42 v implies thatmg x mg x is not 1 dimensional moreover mg x mg x consists of at most single point and is of the formmg y for some y vertns if non empty hence the claim follows consequently i u i u is bijective on any k rational points where k is a field containing fp now we prove that i u i u is birational let s speck i u i u be the morphism induced by the localization at the unique generic point of i u where k i u is the function field of i u by the bijectivity of i u i u on k i u rational points there is a unique morphism s speck i u u such that s i s hence we obtain a homomorphism k u k i u such that k i u i k u k i u is an identity map where k u is the function field of u hence k i u i k u is an isomorphism which implies the assertion finally we prove the the main result for s ssk theorem 7 12 i the scheme s ssk is purely 2 dimensional every irreducible component is projective and birational to the fermat surface defined by x p 1 0 x p 1 1 x p 1 2 x p 1 3 0 in projfp x 0 x 1 x 2 x 3 ii let f be an irreducible component of s ssk then the following hold there are at most p 1 p 2 1 irreducible components of s ssk whose intersections with f is birational to p 1 fp here we endow the intersections with reduced structures there are at most p p 1 p 2 1 irreducible components of s ssk which intersects to f at a single point other irreducible components of s ssk do not intersect f iii each non smooth point in sk w is contained in at most 2 p 1 irreducible components of s ss k iv each irreducible component of s ssk contains at most p 1 p 2 1 non smooth points in sk w proof the assertion i follows from proposition 7 11 in the sequel we only prove iv the others are similar take x verths and i as in proposition 7 11 by proposition 7 11 i induces the following surjection mnfsg m 0 g x 1 i s nsm k w i m 0 g x s nsm k w i m 0 g x by propositions 5 12 iii and 5 40 the left hand side of the surjection above has exactly p 1 p 2 1 elements therefore the assertion follows the supersingular locus 47 8 application to arithmetic intersections for another application we compute the intersection multiplicity of certain cycle called the ggp cycle we keep the notation for dual lattices in l q as definition 5 18 8 1 basic properties of the ggp cycle we define an algebraic group jh over qp by jh r g h k 0 qp r g f f g for any qp algebra r let us also define an algebraic group j 0 h over qp by the same formula for h 0 instead of h the representabilities of jh and j 0 h follow from rz 96 proposition 1 12 we have canonical injections j j 0 h jh moreover we have an isomorphism j 0 h gspin l q of algebraic groups over qp see hp 14 remark 2 8 we define a left action of jh qp onmh as mh mh x 7 x g for g jh qp cf definition 2 14 for the action of j qp on mg then the bijection m 7 l m in theorem 5 2 commutes with the actions of j 0 h qp definition 8 1 let ig h mg mh be the closed immersion defined in proposition 3 3 then we obtain a closed immersion idmg ig h p z mg pz mg spf w mh x 7 x ig h x we define the ggp cycle as the image of id ig h it is a formal scheme over spfw for g jh qp put g id g where id g pz mg spf w mh pz mg spf w mh x y 7 x g y lemma 8 2 for any g jh qp the second projection pr 2 mg spf w mh mh induces an isomorphism g pz ig h mg mgh where mgh is the g fixed part ofmh proof take s nilpw and x y pz mg spf w mh s then we have x y pz g s if and only x y x g 1 y pz mg spf w mh s hence we have y ig h x g 1 y that is y pz ig h mg mgh s therefore pr 2 induces an injection g pz i mg mgh to prove the surjectivity of the morphism above take s nilpw and y pz ig h mg m g h s then there is a unique x pz mg s satisfying ig h x y moreover we have g y y since y pz mgh s therefore we have x ig h x g s and pr 2 x ig h x y hence the assertion follows we moreover rewrite the formal scheme g for g j 0 h qp put l g 5 i 0 zp g i y 1 which is a zp submodule of l q definition 8 3 for a zp submodule v of l q we define a closed formal subschme z v ofmh to be the locus x satisfying 1 v end x proposition 8 4 let g j 0 h qp i we have an equality ig h mg mgh z l g g 48 y oki ii if pz z l g g is an artinian scheme then we have o l og o og that is the left hand side is represented by the right hand side in the derived category of sheaves on pz mg spfw mh proof i take s nilpw and x mh s then we have x ig h mg m g h s if and only if 1 y 1 end x and g note that y 1 0 since g y 1 g y 1 g 1 by definition the condition above is equivalent to the condition that 1 l g end x and g g that is x z l g g ii note that pz mg is a regular formal scheme of dimension 4 by corollary 4 2 hence locally is the intersection of 4 regular divisors put o opz mg spf wmh take x p z z l g g and let si ox 1 i 4 be regular elements such that ox s 1 s 4 o x moreover if we put si g si 4 ox for 5 i 8 since ox is cohen macaulay and dimopz z l g g x dimox s 1 s 8 0 by hypothesis s 1 s 8 form a regular sequence by ega iv 0 corollaire 16 5 6 form ox therefore for 1 i 7 si 1 is regular in ox s 1 si and hence we have torox 1 ox s 1 si ox si 1 ker ox s 1 si si 1 ox s 1 si 0 therefore we have torox 1 o x og x 0 consequently we obtain an equality of sheaves toro 1 o og 0 which implies the assertion if g j 0 h qp and pz ig h mg m g h is an artinian scheme then we define g o l og where is the euler poincare characteristic then we have the following by proposition 8 4 proposition 8 5 under the hypothesis above we have an equality g x pz z l g g lengthw opz z l g g x z 8 2 relation with the bruhat tits strata ofmh we give a description of pz mg h fp in terms of the bruhat tits stratum ofmh for certain vlh we will use it for l g in section 8 3 for vlh put bt h m h vlh m h it is the bruhat tits stratum ofmh attached to moreover the following holds proposition 8 6 hp 14 2 6 the bijection m 7 l m in theorem 5 2 induces a bijection pz bt h fp l special lattice in lq l here l is the fixed part of i z 0 i l which is an element of vlh definition 8 7 for g j 0 h qp we define two subsets of vlh as follow vlgh vlh g for vlgh vl g h vl g h the supersingular locus 49 if vlgh then we have g and hence g induces an element g so 0 see definition 6 8 for the definition of 0 moreover g induces actions of g onmh and bth proposition 8 8 there is an equality pz mg h fp vlg h pz btg h fp proof the bijection m 7 l m in theorem 5 2 induces a bijection pz mg h fp l special lattice in lq l g l l l special lattice in lq l g l l on the other hand the bijection in proposition 8 6 induces a bijection vlg h pz btg h fp vlg h l special lattice in lq l g l l l special lattice in lq l vlgh g l l note that we have g l l if g l l for a special lattice l hence under g l l the condition l vlgh is equivalent to the condition l therefore the assertion follows in the end of this section we give a criterion for non emptyness of pz btg h this is proved in the proof of lzhu 18 theorem 3 6 4 by considering deligne lusztig varieties see also lzhu 18 theorem 3 5 2 proposition 8 9 let g j 0 h qp and vl g h let pg fp t be the characteristic polynomial of g on 0 assume that pg equals the minimal polynomial of g on 0 then we have p z btg h 6 if and only if pg is irreducible in this case we have pz btg h dimfp 0 degpg 8 3 intersection multiplicity of the ggp cycles first we state a result which is essentially proved in lzhu 18 second we define the notion of minusculeness for g j 0 h qp finally we show that the intersection multiplicity is defined for a minuscule g in the sequel we fix g j 0 h qp satisfyingm g h 6 lemma 8 10 we have vl g h 6 and g l g l g proof by the hypothesismgh 6 there is a special lattice l in lq satisfying g l l then we have g l l which concludes the first assertion moreover if p g t qp t is the characteristic polynomial of g on l q then we have p g t zp t therefore the second assertion follows for vlgh we have z mh by definition note that the right hand side is a reduced scheme of characteristic p by lzhu 18 proposition 4 2 11 moreover g induces an element g so 0 as explained after definition 8 7 let pg fp t be the characteristic polynomial of g on 0 definition 8 11 let r fp t be a non zero polynomial we define the reciprocal of r by r t t deg r r t 1 the polynomial r is self reciprocal if r r lemma 8 12 for vlgh the polynomial pg is self reciprocal proof the assertion follows from g so 0 50 y oki for a self reciprocal p fp t let irr p be the set of all monic irreducible factors of p and irrsr p the set of all self reciprocal elements of irr p furthermore put irrnsr p irr p irrsr p we introduce an equivalence relation on irr p and irrnsr p by r cr for some c f p for r irr p let r be the image of r under the canonical map irr p irr p and m r the multiplicity of r in p then we have m r m r since p is self reciprocal proposition 8 13 let vlgh assume that pg equals the minimal polynomial of g on 0 then the following are equivalent i we have pz mg h 6 ii there is a unique qg irrsr pg such that m qg is odd if the conditions above hold then we have pz mg h fp degqg r irrnsr pg 1 m r in particular pz mg h is an artinian scheme the proof below gives a more precise proof of lzhu 18 theorem 3 6 4 see also rtz 13 proposition 8 1 we prepare some lemmas for the assertion above for vlgh and an fp g submodule w of 0 let rw fp t be the characteristic polynomial of g on w lemma 8 14 let vlgh i for vlgh we have an equality pg r pg r hence we obtain a map vl g h r fp t pg rr fp t 7 r ii let q fp t satisfying q pg and q q then the preimage of r fp t pg rqr under equals vlgh pg q proof i we have inclusions of fp g submodules 0 0 let r be the characteristic polynomial of g on then we have r r and pg r pg r hence the assertion follows ii take vlgh then it suffices to show that pg q if and only if pg r qr this follows from i lemma 8 15 let vlgh assume that the assumption on pg in proposition 8 13 holds i the polynomial pg equals the minimal polynomial of g on 0 ii the map in lemma 8 14 is bijective proof i this follows from lemma 8 14 i and the assumption on pg ii first note that we have a bijection vl g h w 0 fp subspace w w g w w 7 hence it suffices to show that the map w 0 fp subspace w w g w w r fp t pg rr fp t w 7 rw the supersingular locus 51 is bijective we have a decomposition of to generalized eigenspaces q irr pg 0 q 0 q ker q g m q note that 0 q is g invariant for any q irr pg since pg equals the minimal polynomial of g on 0 a g invariant subspaces of 0 q is of the form wq a ker q g a im q g m q a where 0 a m q therefore wq a is a unique subspace of 0 whose characteristic polynomial of g equals qa moreover we have dimfp wq a a degq on the other hand for q irr pg 0 a m q v wq a and w 0 we have 6 0 q g a v w v q g 1 a w v q g ag a degq w here the first equality follows from v wq a hence we obtain the following if q q irr pg and q 6 q then 0 q 0 q apply 6 to a m q and w 0 q if q irrsr pg satisfies 2 m q and 0 a m q 1 2 then wqg a is a totally isotropic subspace in 0 qg apply 6 to w 0 qg if q irrsr pg satisfies 2 m q and 0 a m qg 2 then wq a is a totally isotropic subspace in 0 q apply 6 to w wq a if q irrnsr pg 0 a m q and 0 a m q a thenwq a wq a is a totally isotropic subspace in 0 q 0 q apply 6 to w wq a now take r fp t satisfying pg rr fp t if we write r q irr pg q mq then we have ker r g q irr pg wq mq and it is a unique g invariant totally isotropic subspace in 0 satisfying rker r g r therefore we obtain the bijectivity of corollary 8 16 under the hypothesis in lemma 8 15 we have pz btg h 6 if and only if pg irr pg and m pg is odd in this case we have pz btg h degpg proof by lemma 8 15 i and proposition 8 9 it suffices to show that pg is irreducible if and only if pg irrsr pg and m pg is odd suppose that pg is irreducible then we have pg irrsr pg by lemma 8 12 on the other hand 2 m q follows from lemma 8 14 proof of proposition 8 13 first assume that i holds we prove ii by proposition 8 8 there is vlgh satisfying pz bt g h 6 hence we have pg irrsr pg and m pg by corollary 8 16 moreover by lemma 8 14 pg is a unique element of irr pg such that the multiplicity in pg is odd therefore we obtain ii next assume that ii holds we prove i and compute pz mg h fp let qg irrsr pg be as in ii by proposition 8 8 and corollary 8 16 the following hold for vlgh we have pz btg h 6 if and only if pg qg 52 y oki if satisfies the equivalent conditions above then we have pz btg h degqg moreover induces a bijection vlgh pg qg r fp t pg rqg r by lemmas 8 15 ii and 8 14 ii hence it suffices to show the equality r fp t pg rqg r r irrnsr pg 1 m r z 0 the set r fp t pg rqg r consists of elements of the form r irrnsr pg ra r r m r a r r irrsr pg qg r m r 2 where 0 a r m r for any r irrnsr pg in particular it is non empty hence we obtain the desired equality next we compute length fp opz mg h for vlgh and x pz m g h it contributes to computation of the arithmetic intersection number see proposition 8 5 we recall the action of g on s 0 it is given by g l l g l g l for l l s 0 proposition 8 17 there is an isomorphism pz mg h sg 0 proof there is an isomorphism pz m h s 0 see hp 14 theorem 3 9 moreover the isomor phism above is compatible with the actions of g and g by definition hence the assertion follows by proposition 8 17 to compute lengthfp opz mg h it suffices to compute lengthfp osg 0 x for vl g h and x s g 0 however it is already computed by lzhu 18 5 2 5 3 5 4 let us state the result of computation in lzhu 18 let x 0 l 0 l 0 s g 0 fp then l 0 is stable under g since it commutes with define fp and c z 0 as follows fp is the non zero unique eigenvalue of g on l 0 l 0 c is the size of the jordan block of g l 0 of the eigenvalue note that 1 c d the following follows from exactly the same argument as the proof of lzhu 18 corollary 5 4 2 theorem 8 18 i assume p c then there is an isomorphism between the complete local ring of s g at x 0 and fp x x c ii assume that pg equals the minimal polynomial of g on 0 then we have c m qg 1 2 here qg is the polynomial appeared in proposition 8 13 ii now we define the notion of minusculeness for g and compute the intersection multiplicity for minuscule g definition 8 19 let g j 0 h qp an element g is regular semi simple if l q 5 i 0 qp g i y 1 a regular semi simple element g is minuscule if l g vlh we suppose that g is regular semi simple and minuscule then we have l g vlgh l g by lemma 8 10 moreover put 0 g 0 l g g gl g so 0 g pg pgl g fp t g l g and cg cl g the supersingular locus 53 lemma 8 20 the polynomial pg equals the minimal polynomial of g proof note that we have l g 5 i 0 zp g i y 1 since g is regular semi simple and minuscule it suffices to show that l g is g cyclic that is there is u l g such that l g 5 i 0 zp g i u this follows from the same argument as in the proof of rtz 13 lemma 5 3 summarizing the results above we obtain the following theorem 8 21 assume g j 0 h qp is regular semi simple minuscule and satisfies m g h 6 i the following are equivalent we have g 6 there is a unique qg irrsr pg such that m qg is odd if the conditions above hold then we have g fp degqg r irrnsr pg 1 m r ii if g satisfies the condition i then we have an equality g degqg m qg 1 2 r irrnsr pg 1 m r proof i this follows from proposition 8 13 and lemma 8 20 ii by lemma 8 2 proposition 8 4 i and z l g mg l g we have g pz mg h l g hence g is defined by i and proposition 8 4 ii moreover by proposition 8 17 we have g x sg 0 g fp lengthfp osg 0 g x z on the other hand by theorem 8 18 ii and lemma 8 20 we have cg m qg 1 2 we claim that cg 2 indeed since degqg 2 4 6 by the proof of proposition 8 13 we have m qg 6 2 3 hence we have cg m qg 1 2 3 1 2 2 as claimed we compute the intersection multiplicity since s g 0 g is an artinian scheme lengthfp osg 0 g x equals the length of the complete local ring at s g 0 g at x for any x sg 0 g which equals cg m qg 1 2 by theorem 8 18 ii on the other hand by proposition 8 13 we have s g 0 g fp degqg r irrnsr pg 1 m r therefore the assertion follows appendix a complement of the proof of hp 14 corollary 2 14 in this appendix we provide a complement of the proof of hp 14 corollary 2 14 it is introduced as theorem 5 2 in section 5 1 we use the notation in sections 3 3 and 5 1 to prove the assertion they asserted in hp 14 lemma 2 15 the bijectivity of the map pz nearly self dual lattices in dq k self dual lattices in lq k m 7 l m where l m v lq k v m m we claim that the lattice l m in lq k is not necessarily self dual even when m is a nearly self dual lattice in dq k to avoid this possibility we restrict the left hand side of the map above 54 y oki we also denote an element of h k as h 0 h 1 where hi gl dq i k 0 k for i 0 1 by the same manner as in section 3 3 lemma a 1 denote by ck the stabilizer of d w w k in h k then we have an equality h 0 k ck h h 0 h 1 h k ordp det h 0 ordp det h 1 proof we have an isomorphism h k gl dq 0 k 0 k k h 7 h 0 sim h the proof is the same as the isomorphy of the first homomorphism as in lemma 3 16 i it induces the following isomorphisms h 0 k h 0 c gl dq 0 k 0 k k c 2 det h 0 ck gl d 0 w w k w k therefore we obtain h 0 k ck h 0 c gl dq 0 k 0 k k 2 ordp c ordp det h 0 which is equivalent to the assertion example a 2 for i z let mi p id 0 p id 1 w w k then mi is self dual on the other hand we have mi h i d w w k where h p iddq 0 p 1 iddq 1 then hi h 0 k 0 c if and only if i 0 put l v lq v d d then we have l mi p 2 i l w w k which is self dual if and only if i 0 next we modify the bijection m 7 l m write zk for the center of h k then we have an injection h 0 k ckzk ckzk pz nearly self dual lattices in dq k h 7 h d w w k definition a 3 a special nearly self dual lattice is a lattice m in dq k such that the homothety class of m is in the image of the map the definition amounts to saying that there is an element h in h 0 k or h 0 k ck such that m h d w w k by definition special nearly self dual lattices are zp 2 invariant and nearly self dual in the sense of hp 14 2 5 we state the modified version of hp 14 lemma 2 15 the proof is the same as the original one proposition a 4 the map pz special nearly self dual lattices in dq k self dual lattices in lq k m 7 l m is bijective by the modification above hp 14 lemma 2 16 holds only for special nearly self dual lattices the precise statement is as follows lemma a 5 let m be a special nearly self dual lattice in dq k and put l l m where l m is the self dual lattice in lq k corresponding to the bijection m 7 l m in proposition a 4 let i z satisfying m pim and we regard m as a self dual symplectic space over w k by pi i for an isotropic line l in l w k k m l x m w k k v x 0 for any v l is a zp 2 stable lagrangian subspace in m w k k hence we obtain a map isotropic lines in l w k k zp 2 stable lagrangian subspaces in m w k k l 7 m l the supersingular locus 55 ii the map l 7 m l in i is bijective the inverse map is given by m 7 l m v l w k k v m 0 moreover we have l m v l w k k v m m we can also prove the following by the same proof of hp 14 lemma 2 16 lemma a 6 let k k be a field extension i for an isotropic line l in lq k lq k k k m l x dq k v x 0 for any v l is a zp 2 stable lagrangian subspace in dq k hence we obtain a map isotropic lines in lq k zp 2 stable lagrangian subspaces in dq k l 7 m l ii the map l 7 m l in i is bijective the inverse map is given by m 7 l m v lq k v m 0 moreover we have l m v lq k v m m lastly we check that hp 14 corollary 2 14 is true proposition a 7 for a dieudonne lattice m in dq k f 1 pm is special nearly self dual proof put d w k b d w w k where b g k 0 is defined as in section 2 1 write f 1 pm h d w k hb d w w k where h h k since b h 0 k by definition it suffices to prove h h 0 k ck put g h 1 b h b 1 h k then g induces an isomorphism f d w k h 1 f h d w k h 1 f h d w k on the other hand for i 0 1 put d w k i id w k then we have lengthw k d w k 1 i f d w k i lengthw k d w k 1 i h 1 f h d w k i 2 by the kottwitz condition see also the proof of hp 14 proposition 2 10 therefore we have ordp det gi 0 if we write g g 0 g 1 taking determinant of the defining equation of g we obtain det g 0 det g 1 det h 0 det h 1 1 det h 0 det h 1 det h 0 1 det h 1 det h 1 1 det h 0 in qp 2 qp k 0 k 0 k 0 which concludes that ordp det h 0 ordp det h 1 therefore the assertion follows from lemma a 1 now we can give a proof of hp 14 corollary 2 14 take a dieudonne lattice in dq k then proposition a 7 implies that f 1 pm is special nearly self dual we apply lemma a 5 to f 1 pm and the assertion therefore follows from the same proof as the original one appendix b reducedness of the bruhat tits strata of mh in this appendix we prove the following theorem b 1 for vlh the formal scheme mh is a reduced scheme of characteristic p to prove the assertion above we introduce some notations definition b 2 cf lzhu 18 definition 4 1 6 let c be the category defined as follows objects in c are triples o s where o is a local artinian w algebra s is a w homomorphism o fp and is a divided power structure on ker s see bo 78 definitions 3 1 definition 3 27 56 y oki a morphism of objects in c from o 1 s 1 1 to o 2 s 2 2 is a w homomorphism g o 1 o 2 such that s 1 s 2 g and g ker s 1 1 2 g ker s 1 remark b 3 i for an object o s in c the homomorphism s is surjective since it is a w homomorphism hence ker s is the unique maximal or prime ideal of o and s induces an isomorphism between the residue field of o and fp ii for a morphism g o 1 s 1 1 o 2 s 2 2 in c we have g ker s 1 ker s 2 that is g is a local homomorphism we simply denote o s c by o as long as there is no confusion definition b 4 let l q be a quadratic space over w let isotl be the functor which parametrizes all isotropic lines in l w r for any w algebra r here an isotropic line l in l w r is an r submodule of l w r which is locally a direct summand of rank 1 and q l 0 note that the functor isotl is representable by a projective scheme suppose that r is a local ring whose residue field is fp and let s r fp be the canonical homomorphism then for an isotropic line l in l w fp put liftr l isotl s 1 l isotl r under the notations above we prove the following proposition b 5 let x mh fp we denote by m h x the completion of mh at x let m be the dieudonne lattice in dq corresponding to x under the bijection in theorem 5 1 and l the image of m under the bijection m 7 l m in theorem 5 2 moreover put fil 1 l p l l p l it is an isotropic line in l w fp l p l by lemma a 5 then for o c there is a bijection fo m h x o lifto fil 1 l satisfying the following properties i for a morphism g o o we have fo m h x g isotg l fo m h x o lifto fil 1 l ii let v be a zp submodule in l q satisfying x z v where z v is a closed defined in definition 8 3 denote by z v x the completion of z l at x then the bijection fo induces a bijection z v x o l lifto fil 1 l l vo in l w o where vo is the o submodule of l wo generated by the image of v under l l wo the assertion above is a variant of lzhu 18 theorem 4 1 7 hence if proposition b 5 is true then theorem b 1 follows from the same argument as the proof of lzhu 18 theorem 4 2 11 to prove proposition b 5 we generalize lemma a 5 for this we moreover prepare some notations definition b 6 let m and i be as in lemma a 5 let lag z p 2 m be a functor which parametrizes zp 2 stable lagrangian subspaces in m w r for any w algebra r here a lagrangian subspace m in m w r is an r submodule of m w r which is locally a direct summand of rank 4 and pi m m 0 note that the functor lag z p 2 m is representable by a projective scheme suppose that r is a local ring whose residue field is fp and let s r fp be the canonical homomorphism then for an isotropic line m in m w fp put lift z p 2 r m lag z p 2 m s 1 m lag z p 2 m r lemma b 7 let m and l be as in lemma a 5 the supersingular locus 57 i for a w algebra r and l isotr l m l x m w r v x 0 for any v l is a zp 2 stable lagrangian subspace in m w r hence l 7 m l induces a morphism of w schemes f isotl lag z p 2 m ii the morphism f in i is an isomorphism the inverse is given by lag z p 2 m r isotl r m 7 l m v l w r v m 0 for any w algebra r moreover we have l m v l w r v m m to prove lemma b 7 we need a preparation on certain c l modules as pointed out in the proof of hp 14 lemma 2 16 the inclusion lq end dq induces an isomorphism i c l end m we regard m as a left c l module under the isomorphism above on the other hand we regard c l as a left c l module by the left multiplication lemma b 8 under the notation in lemma b 7 there is an isomorphism c l m 8 of c l modules proof fix a w basis e 1 e 8 of m and let 1 c l be the element corresponding to the endomor phism m m e i 7 i 1 e i under the isomorphism i c l end m then both 1 c l and m are free w modules of rank 8 hence there is an isomorphism 1 c l m of w modules which associates a desired isomorphism by the morita equivalence proof of lemma b 7 i by localizing r we may assume that l is free over r take v l so that l rv the stability of m l under the zp 2 action is a consequence of the equality 0 a v v 0 a for any a zp 2 next we prove the equality 7 m l v m w r and that it is a totally isotropic r direct summand of d w r of rank 4 since m is special nearly self dual there is h h 0 k 0 such that m h d hence we may assume m d write v 6 i 1 aixi for ai r see definition for the definition of xi then we have 8 a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 a 5 a 6 0 on the other hand since l is an r direct summand of l w r we have ai r for some i here we suppose that a 1 r other cases are similar we may assume a 1 1 then by using 8 we obtain m l v d w r r e 2 a 3 e 3 a 5 e 4 r e 1 a 6 e 3 a 4 e 4 r a 4 f 1 a 5 f 2 f 4 r a 6 f 1 a 3 f 2 f 3 which is an r direct summand of d w r of rank 4 hence the assertion follows ii the injectivity follows from lemmas a 5 ii a 6 ii and the nakayama s lemma next we prove the surjectivity put gu m r h c glz p 2 zpr m w r p i h v h w cpi v w for all v w m w r 58 y oki then we have an isomorphism gu m r gl 0 m w r r h 7 h 0 sim h see definition 2 6 for the definition of 0 the proof is the same as the isomorphy of the first homomor phism as in lemma 3 16 i moreover if we set gu 0 m r h c gu m r c 2 det z p 2 zpr h then the isomorphism above induces the following isomorphism gu 0 m r h 0 c gl 0 m w r r c 2 det h 0 on the other hand we have a bijection lag z p 2 m r r direct summands of 0 m w r of rank 2 m 7 0 m which commutes with the canonical actions of gu m r gl 0 m w r r since gu 0 m r acts transitively on the set of all r direct summands of m w r of rank 2 so does lag z p 2 m r hence the surjectivity follows next we give an inverse of f take m lag z p 2 m r by localizing r we may assume that m is free over r take v l w r such that rv isotl r and m m rv this is possible by the proof of the bijectivity of f then by 7 we have l m l v m w r rv which implies the assertion for l on the other hand for w l we have v w if and only if wvc l vc l by the same argument as in the proof of hp 14 lemma 2 16 moreover the condition wvc l vc l is interpreted as w m m by lemma b 8 hence the equality for l m follows proof of proposition b 5 put fil 1 x pf 1 m pm then it is a zp 2 stable lagrangian subspace of m w fp m pm let o c by the grothendieck messing theory see mes 72 chapter v theorem 1 6 we have a bijection gmo m h x o lift z p 2 o fil 1 x on the other hand the bijection m 7 lo m in lemma b 7 induce a bijection lx o lift z p 2 o fil 1 x lifto fil 1 l now put fo lx o gmo then fo is bijective and satisfies i by proposition b 5 i ii and iv next we prove ii for x m h x o we have x z v x o if and only if v gmo x gmo x for any v v by proposition b 5 iii it is equivalent to the condition that vo lo gmo x fo x references bas 74 h bass clifford algebras and spinor norms over
