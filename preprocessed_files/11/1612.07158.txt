known that for each prime p there exists a generic newton polygon for all polynomials f ina fp for the traditional l function l f 1 s but these generic spaces over fp for different prime p have no known connection in this paper we discover a global generic set in a whose special fiber gives the generic newton polygon at almost all prime p theorem 1 1 fix d 1 d 2 3 that defines for each

generalization of the main theorem in dwx 16 theorem 1 2 answering question 1 8 of dwx 16 there are some noted difference between our 2 variable result and their 1 variable one that we shall point out here while davis wan xiao proves that for any fixed prime p the p adic newton slopes form an arithmetic progression for all m large enough our result fixes any positive integer m and proves an arithmetic progress for all prime p large enough their result applies to all 1 variable polynomials while our result is for generic 2 variable polynomials finally their 1 variable case is arithmetic progression while for 2 variable case it is weighted arithmetic progression theorem 1 1 also yields a direct generalization of the main theorems in zh 03 and zh 04 artin schreier witt cover am f has the following zeta function z am f s exp k 1 am f fqk sk k if one writes it as z am f s 1 1 qs m k 1 l f s 1 where the second product ranges over all characters of conductor equal to pk it is not hard to derive an immediate application of theorems 1 1 and 1 2 corollary 1 3 let f u q and let p be large enough then npq 1 qs z am f s 1 m k 1 gnpl k p pk 1 p 1 let af be the eigencurve associated to the artin schreier witt tower defined in dwx 16 theorem 1 5 for 1 variable polynomial f it was shown by davis wan xiao that when restricted to the boundary of the weight space the eigencurve af is an infinite disjoint union of subspaces which are finite and flat over the weight annulus in particular its newton slopes are in arithmetic progressions this property clearly mirrors that of coleman mazur s eigencurve cm 98 see also bg 15 for survey of other related recent progress and conjectures yet there is no available explicit conjecture upon similar properties for eigencurve over 2

understanding of eigencurves in our artin schreier witt setting our paper is organized as follows section 2 recalls basic notations of dwork liu wan s t adic l functions and produces a p and t adic interpolation of its newton polygon for generic polynomial in two variables in a fp as applications of these interpolations we go on to prove the main results of this paper theorems 1 1 and 1 2 are proved in theorem 3 11 application to eigencurves relative to artin schreier witt covers is discussed in section 4 where theorem 1 4 is proved 2 interpolating newton slopes of character power series we first recall l functions l f s and character power series c f s among other things for any n variable polynomial function f in section 2 2 we investi gate polynomial functions which will turn out to be coefficients of c f later and split it into a product of p adic part and t adic part a key step for our interpo lation of c f we apply this finding in p adic and t adic interpolation of newton

namely is the region 0 x d 1 and 0 y d 2 let s be the set of all integral points in the cone of for some subset s of s there is the simplex partition s s 1 s 2 according to v 1 d 1 v 2 d 2 or not see

investigation in 2 variable case we shall fix a 2 dimensional residue class r of p mod d 1 d 2 that is a pair r 1 r 2 in z d 1 z z d 2 z such that r 1 r 2 p mod d 1 p mod d 2 with 0 r 1 d 1 1 0 r 2 d 2 1 of course each residue is in bijection with the residue mod lcm d 1 d 2 we denote p r for any s s let sym s denote the set of all permutations of s for any i s and sym s let r r 1 r 2 p i i mod d 1 d 2 such that 0 r 1 d 1 1 0 r 2 d 2 1 write 9 m s s 1 d 1 i s 1 r 1 1 d 2 i s 2 r 2 w s i s w i 1 p 1 m s let m 0 s min sym s m s let kk be the set of all subsets s s with k elements and let k 0 k be its subset with i s with w i w i for any i not in s then for p large enough mins w s is achieved at and only at s k 0 k for suitable k we denote by sym s for all such that m s m 0 s d we write w k i s w i m s p 1 m s m 0 s d slopes for artin schreier witt tower in two variables 7 for some s k 0 k for every sym s define a rational number qs 2 i s 2 1 pi 1 i 1 d 1 pi 2 i 2 d 2 pi 1 i 1 d 1 let qs 1 be defined similarly by swapping subindices 1 and 2 in the above formula let ad 1 d 2 ad 1 0 a 0 d 2 a 0 0 1 and let n id for any 0 define a polynomial function in zp q a v g kn p sym fn 1 kn sgn q fn 1 q fn 2 i fn a r then we define a polynomial in z a v g kn r sym fn 1 kn sgn ukn pq fn 1 q fn 2 i fn a r 10 where ukn p i fn 2 pi 1 d 1 p i 2 d 2 i 1 d 1 i fn 1 pi 2 d 2 p i 1 d 1 i 2 d 2 we shall use o to denote higher order terms p adically or adically below which should be clear from context lemma 2 1 fix d 1 d 2 3 and fix a nontrivial residue class r in z d 1 z d 2 fix n id then g kn r ukn pg kn p o p 1 there exists a least nonnegative integer d 2 such that g kn r is a nonzero polynomial in z a v proof 1 after some elementary cancellation we notice by its very defini tion that ukn pq fn 1 q fn 2 mod p is independent of p moreover the subindices r are also independent of p this proves that g kn r depends only on d 1 d 2 sym 0 fn and r 2 notice that for each permutation sym fn there is a corresponding monomial i fn a r in the sum of gkn r by 7 i fn a r where r p i i for nonzero ness of the polynomial g kn r it suffices to find a monomial i fn a r that is unique namely it can not be cancelled by other terms to this end we shall explicitly locate such that its corresponding monomial is unique some preparation is in order first of all we define a total order on the residue set z d 1 z z d 2 z as follows first of all we order them in terms of weight as defined in section 2 1 namely define v v if w v w v for the subset of vectors with equal weight we order them in lexicographic order with the first coordinate of higher order this defines a total order we write v v this order defines a total order on the set of monomials r z d 1 z d 2 a t r r index r is ordered by as follows r a t r r r a s r r when t r r s r r in lexicographic order by abuse of notation we call this total order on as well we shall locate the permutation sym fn that corresponds to the monomial of the unique highest order let r be the 8 hui june zhu kn kn residue matrix p i j with i j fn then each row and column consists of pairwise distinct vectors in z d 1 z z d 2 z take all entries of highest order in the two diagonal blocks of r where i j fn 1 or i j fn 2 by definition any two entries of the same order necessarily lie in different rows and different columns collect every x y in r assign x y then cross off the x the row and y th column repeat this step on the left over matrix until entire matrix r is crossed off this obviously defines a permutation in sym fn then its corresponding monomial under is r z d 1 z d 2 a m r r where m r i fn p i i r by construction it is of the highest order in the two diagonal blocks hence it is unique 3 each permutation constructed from part 2 above yields a specialization m fn kn 1 d 1 fn 1 r 1 1 d 2 fn 2 r 2 where the two sums ranges over all entries r 1 r 2 picked in the residue ma trix r from the above algorithm suppose the minimum m 0 fn is achieved at 0 and its corresponding entries in r are r 01 r 0 2 at the same same row of r then r 1 r 0 1 d 1 and r 2 r 0 2 d 2 and hencem fn m 0 fn d this proves that m fn m 0 fn d 2 d and hence sym fn for some d 2 by definition 10 we thus conclude that g kn r is nonzero 2 3 generic newton slope formula let notation be as in lemma 2 1 for simplicity from now on we shall denote by gkn r g kn r ms

integers d 1 d 2 3 that defines fix a nontrivial residue class r in z d 1 z d 2 for any t ranging over all primes p in r define a t parameterized piece wise linear lower convex function on 0 2 d 1 d 2 gnpl t npt n id 1 t n t s w n 1 t 2 n t s w n where n mfn mfn 1 and n t n d n t 1 let gnpc t be the product of gnpl t and the algebraic polygon of 1 1 s 2 remark 2 4 1 slopes of gnpc p are gnpc p i 1 n id i 1 n p i 1 n p i w n where 0 n p 1 since r is nontrivial for p large enough we have i 1 n p 6 i 1 m p where n 6 m id and i 0 unless and only unless n 2 d n 0 2 these newton polygons are defined in such a way that they depend on and the residue class r moreover lim t gnpl t hpl lim t gnpc t hpc proposition 2 5 1 let hpc be as in 5 we write np d for the trun cation of first d terms of a newton polygon np then snp p gnp p hpc d 2 the two newton polygons gnp p and snp p both have horizon tal length equal to d for p large enough depending only on d 1 d 2 gnp p snp p with vertices exactly at kn wkn its slopes with multiplicities are n id w n n moreover all slopes are in 0 1 3 for p large enough depending only on d 1 d 2 the two newton polygons snp p and hpc d have vertices both at x kn n id where the y coordinate gap is equal to n p 1 where n z 0 lcm d 1 d 2 furthermore lim p gnp p lim p snp p hpc d proof 1 that snp p gnp p hpc for all p is immediate by their definitions 2 we shall show that kn wkn is a vertex point for gnp p for each n id pick two positive integers k k such that k kn k notices that k kn 1 and 1 kn k d so 1 k kn 1 kn k 1 1 kn 1 1 d 12 by definition we have ms d and hence ms mfn max ms mfn 2 d 13 for any k kn by the argument above and 11 we have s k kn n d 1 p 1 d kn k 10 hui june zhu since kn k we have km k km 1 for some m n 1 and m id we have similarly s kn k n 1 d 1 p 1 d k kn therefore s kn k s k kn 1 d d p 1 1 k kn 1 kn k 1 d d p 1 1 1 d 1 d d 1 p 1 when p d 2 d 1 we have that s kn k s k kn 0 by the definition of slope function s this means that kn wkn is a vertex on gnp p for any k 0 write k w k for points on snp p we claim that for p large enough w k wk 2 d p 1 by 11 and 13 if k 6 kn s k kn n 1 d 1 p 1 ms mfn k kn 1 p 1 d k kn 14 let s k 0 k and kn k kn 1 by definition and proposition 2 5 1 w k wk k kn kn 1 kn wkn 1 wkn it follows w k wk w k wkn wk wkn wkn 1 wkn kn 1 kn k kn n 1 d k kn ms mfn p 1 s kn 1 kn n 1 d k kn ms mfn p 1 we have w k wk s kn 1 kn n 1 d k kn 1 p 1 ms mfn d p 1 combining the above and 14 the difference in y coordinates of gnp p and snp p at each k is w k wk 2 d p 1 which approaches 0 as p this proves that snp p gnp p for p large enough 3 the vertices of hpc are at kn i fn w i so the gap between hpc and gnp at x kn is n p 1 but n only depends on the residue class r hence it is bounded in terms of d 1 d 2 it follows from the definition of n that its denominator is the least common multiple of d 1 d 2 3 existence of global generic polynomials 3 1 interpolating character series in p and t adically for the p adic artin

using our hypothesis that ad 1 d 2 ad 1 0 a 0 d 2 1 we conclude part 1 and its adic valuation in part 3 the other case i s 2 in part 2 is similar which we omit for ease of notation we suppress in all wkn and gkn r from lemma 2 1 below whenever context allows proposition 3 2 let notation be as in lemma 2 1 for any n id hkn p 1 wknu 1 kn pgkn r o p 1 wkn p 1 wkno p 1 proof let w fn be as in 9 by

consider f u z for p large enough by the transformation lemma of zh 12 section 5 by lemma 2 1 g is a nonzero polynomial with coefficients in q this shows that u is zariski dense open subset of a

let notation be as in proposition 3 4 1 suppose f u q and for p large enough npq l f 1 s 1 gnpl p npq c f 1 s gnpc p 2 let f a q then for p large enough npp l f 1 s 1 gnpl p npp c f 1 s gnpc p if and only if f uo q proof 1 by 2 and 3 npq l f s 1 d npq c f s d gnp p n id w n n 14 hui june zhu by proposition 3 4 1 by symmetry of the newton polygon npq l f 1 s 1 the rest d slopes are n id 2 n w n in summary npq l f 1 s 1 gnpl p consequently we have npq c f 1 s gnpc p 2 proof of this part is similar to the above by applying proposition 3 4 2 liu and wan proved in lw 09 that if np a p 1 c f s hpc holds for one nontrivial implies that it holds for all non trivial application of theorem 3 5 yields a similar statement for gnpc p in theorem 3 6 below which proves a 2 variable case of liu wan s conjectures 7 10 and 7 11 in lw 09 theorem 3 6 independency of character let be any character zp c p of conductor pm for some m z 1 let notation be as in proposition 3 4 1 for any f u q and for p large enough np a p 1 c f s is indepen dent of m and np a p 1 c f s npta p 1 c f t s gnpc p 2 for any f uo q and for p large enough np p 1 c f s is independent of m and np p 1 c f s nptp 1 c f t s gnpc p proof notice that for any nontrivial character np a p 1 c f s npta p 1 c f t s gnpc p but np a p 1 1 c f 1 s gnpc p by theorem 3 5 1 thus the equalities hold above and that is npta p 1 c f t s gnpc p this proves part 1 proof of part 2 follows from same argument via applying theorem 3 5 2 combining this theorem and remark 2 4 one observes the following statements corollary 3 7 1 for any f u q we have limp np a p 1 c f s limp gnpc p hpc 2 for any f u 0 q we have limp np p 1 c f s limp gnpc p hpc 3 3 generic slopes for higher characters and arithmetic progression we will use the independency of character theorem 3 6 to compute the q adic newton slopes for any character m of conductor p m definition 3 8 formula for generic newton polygons higher order character for any n i 1

product of gnpl m t and the algebraic polygon of 1 1 s 2 slopes for artin schreier witt tower in two variables 15 remark 3 9 1 one observes n 1 t n t and n i t i 1 n t tm 1 for all i z 1 also one notices that gnpl m p has length 2 d 1 d 2 p 2 m 1 gnpl m p 2 pm 1 1 i 1 n id n i p 2 n i p nn i 2 a direct computation shows that gnpc m t i 1 n id i 1 n t tm 1 i 1 n t tm 1 iw n 3 if we write gnpl t d j 1 j then gnpl m t tm 1 1 i 1 d j 1 i 1 j tm 1 n i where n i i for 1 i tm 1 and n i 2 tm 1 i for tm 1 i 2 tm 1 1 in particular gnpl m p is p m adic weighted arithmetic progression of gnpl p in the following theorem we prove the existence of global generic polynomials whose reduction at all but finitely many prime p is generic theorem 3 10 let m zp c p be any character of conductor p m with m 1 let notation be as in proposition 3 4 1 for any f u q for p large enough we have npq l f m s 1 gnpl m p for all m 1 2 let f a q then for all p large enough npp l f m s 1 gnpl m p for any m 1 if and only if f uo q proof by theorem 3 6 1 for f u q np a p 1 m c f m s gnpc m p as q a p 1 m pm 1 npq c f m s i 1 n id i 1 n p pm 1 iw n by 2 npq l f m s 1 has precisely 2 dp 2 m 1 slopes in the following set in 0 2 2 pm 1 1 i 1 n id i 1 n p pm 1 iw n pm 1 1 i 1 n id 1 i 1 n p pm 1 2 iw n after cancellation npq l f m s 1 2 pm 1 1 i 1 n id i 1 n p pm 1 nn i p by remark 3 9 this proves part 1 proof of part 2 follows the same argument and theorem 3 6 2 finally we shall prove our main theorems theorems 1 1 and theorem 1 2 of this paper below 16 hui june zhu theorem 3 11 main theorem fix d 1 d 2 3 that defines let a be the coefficient parameter space of all polynomial f v a v x v with x 1 x 2 degree equal to d 1 d 2 let gnpl m t and gnpc m t be defined in definition 3 8 for nontrivial residue class r 1 there is a zariski dense open subset u in a defined over q such that for all f u q and prime p large enough in r we have npq l f m s 1 gnpl m p np a p 1 m c f m s npta p 1 c f t s gnpc m p for any character m zp c p of conductor p m with m 1 2 there is a zariski dense open subset uo in a defined over q such that for all f uo q and prime p large enough in r we have npp l f m s 1 gnpl m p np p 1 m c f m s nptp 1 c f t s gnpc m p for any character m zp c p of conductor p m with m 1 proof consider the natural projection map a a defined as follows for any f in a represented by a v v z 2 such that ad 1 d 2 ad 1 0 a 0 d 2 6 0 is sent via to a v v z 2 such that ad 1 d 2 ad 1 0 a 0 d 2 1 let u 1 u and uo 1 uo we have u u o are open dense subsets in a then our statement follows from that in theorem 3 10 remark 3 12 one can prove this theorem for a directly via similiar argument as that for that of a above in theorem 3 10 which would be able to give an explicit description of the set u in an analogous fashion as that in proposition 3 4 we leave the details to the interested readers 4 generic eigencurves for 2 variable artin schreier witt towers eigencurve for artin schreier witt towers were introduced in dwx 16 section 4 letwp denote the rigid analytic open unit disc associated to zp t recall that eigencurve af associated to the artin schreier witt tower for f v z 2 a v x v is the zero locus of c f t s viewed as a rigid analytic subspace of wp gm rig where s is the coordinate of the second factor denote the natural projection to the first factor by wtp af wp davis wan xiao showed that for a fixed prime p when f is one variable of degree d that for m large enough the eigencurve af is disjoint union of finite flat cover of the weight space wp each is zero locus of degree d proposition 4 1 let notation be as in theorem 3 11 let f u q and let p be large enough suppose for any n id we assume that n 6 0 1 then c f t s i 1 n id pn i s p n i s where pn i s and p n i s are polynomials in zp t s of degree iw n pure of t a p 1 adic slope i 1 n d 1 d 2 n p 1 and i 1 n d 1 d 2 n p 1 respectively 2 the eigencurve af is an infinite disjoint union af i 1 n id af n ia f n i where each af n i and a f n i respectively is of the zero locus of pn i s and p n i s respectively slopes for artin schreier witt tower in two variables 17 proof by theorem 3 11 the slopes for the eigencurvesaf are npta p 1 c f t s gnpc p since n 0 for all n id and p is large enough all slopes in gnpc p described in remark 2 4 are distinct by elementary p adic weierstrass preparation theorem c f t s split accordingly let pn i be its factor polynomial corresponding to slope i 1 n p segment and p n i to slope i 1 n p segment both of degree iw n this proves part 1 part 2 follows formally by setting af n i for the zero locus of pn s s and a f n i for that of p n i s the above splitting of af depends on the shape of the t adic newton polygon of c f t s when f is not generic the newton polygon goes up in general and subsequently its breaking points will change accordingly the only permanent ver tex points in this situation are the right endpoint of the length 1 slope 0 segment and the left endpoint of the length 1 slope 2 segment in l f t s slopes in between are in the interval 0 2 this observation gives rise to the following theorem theorem 4 2 theorem 1 4 let notation be as in proposition 4 1 let f u q then af is an infinite disjoint union af af 0 i 1 af i where af i is the zero locus of a polynomial of degree 2 i 1 d 1 d 2 1 with t adic slopes lying in the interval i 1 i with 0 or w d and af 0 is a closed point proof write d d 1 d 2 let w d if d 0 and 0 otherwise so 2 is the length of slope 1 segment in gnpl p now our statement follows by counting the slopes multiplicities in gnpc p see remark 2 4 following the paragraph above this theorem the proof of theorem 1 4 does not take advantage of any special property of gnpc p this indicates that an analog of this theorem may hold generally for all prime p and all 2 variable f in a q when m large enough namely af is a disjoint union of covers of degree n n 2 d 1 d 2 n 4 d 1 d 2 n 6 d 1 d 2 for some n with
