irreducible cuspidal c representations of a reductive p adic group g over a field c of characteristic different from p in all known cases such a represen tation is the compactly induced representation indgj from a smooth c representation of a compact modulo centre subgroup j of g when c is algebraically closed for many groups g a list of pairs j has been produced such that any irreducible cuspidal c representation of g has the form indgj for a pair j unique up to conjugation we verify that those lists are stable under the action of field automorphisms of c and we produce similar lists when c is no longer assumed algebraically closed our other main result concerns supercuspidality this notion makes sense for the irreducible cuspidal c representations of g but also for the representations

reductive linear group defined over f and c a field of characteristic c we are interested in irreducible smooth c representations of g g f most of the literature supposes that the coefficient field c is the field c of complex numbers but the study of congruences of automorphic forms and the modularity conjectures of galois representations use representations over number fields or finite fields we concentrate here on the case c 6 p which we always assume and for which our basic reference is 55 with no further assumption on c we investigate the irreducible c representations of g we concentrate on the cuspidal ones since every irreducible smooth c representation of g embeds in a representation parabolically induced from an irreducible cuspidal c representation of some levi subgroup of g when c is algebraically closed all known irreducible cuspidal c representations of g are compactly induced from an open subgroup compact modulo the centre and one conjectures that it is the case for any g in this paper we extend many known results to a general coefficient field c as we now explain for us a cuspidal c type in g is a pair j where j g is an open compact modulo the centre subgroup and is an isomorphism class of smooth c representations of j such that the representation indgj of g compactly induced from j is irreducible hence as we show cuspidal a set x of cuspidal c types in g is said to satisfy exhaustion if all irreducible cuspidal c representations are of this form unicity if indgj determines j modulo g conjugation intertwining if the endomorphism c algebras of and indgj are isomorphic that condition is automatic when c is algebraically closed h stability for a subgroup h aut c if for j x and h j is also in x when c is algebraically closed and for many of our groups g a list of cuspidal c types j has been produced which satisfies exhaustion sometimes only for level 0 representations and often unicity for those lists we verify aut c stability which allows us to produce similar lists when c is no longer assumed algebraically closed theorem 1 1 let c be a field of characteristic c 6 p and ca an algebraic closure of c 1 any irreducible cuspidal c representation of g of level 0 is induced from a type in a list of cuspidal types in g satisfying intertwining unicity and aut c stability 1 2 any irreducible cuspidal c representation of g is induced from a type in a list y of cuspidal types in g satisfying intertwining and unicity if g admits a set xa of cuspidal ca types satisfying unicity exhaustion and autc c a stability if xa satisfies aut ca stability then y satisfies aut c stability to construct y from xa we replace each j a xa by k a where k is the g normalizer of j and a indkj a we prove that k is open and compact modulo the centre proposition 4 16 and that the set ya of ca types k a in g associated to xa satisfies the same properties as xa proposition 3 18 the new set ya has the advantage that it satisfies autc c a unicity if autc c a then indgk ind g k implies we obtain y by replacing k a ya by k where is an irreducible smooth c representation of 1 those types are called of level 0 representations of a reductive p adic group in characteristic distinct from p 3 k such that a is isotypic isomorphic to a direct sum of representations isomorphic to as a c representation of k this relies on the decomposition theorem of ca c for a simple module over a c algebra with an endomorphism ring of finite c dimension 31 we recall that decomposition theorem in section 2 applying our method to the list of cuspidal ca types in g constructed by bushnell kutzko 11 moy prasad 43 morris 42 weissmann 58 minguez s cherre 41 cui 15 16 kurinczuk skodlerack stevens 37 skodlerack 51 yu fintzen 26 we obtain theorem 1 2 let c be a field of characteristic c 6 p 1 any irreducible cuspidal c representation of g of level 0 is compactly induced and g admits a list of level 0 cuspidal c types in g satisfying intertwining unicity exhaustion and aut c stability 2 any irreducible cuspidal c representation of g is compactly induced and g admits a list of cuspidal c types satisfiying intertwining unicity exhaustion and aut c stability in the following cases the semimple rank of g is 1 except for unicity which is not known for all g of rank 1 g sl n f g gl n d for a central division algebra d of finite dimension over f g is a classical group a unitary symplectic or special orthogonal group as in 37 and p 6 2 g a quaternionic form of a classical group as above g is a moderately ramified connected reductive group and p not dividing the order of the absolute weyl group theorem 1 1 applies rather generally indeed we show that if ca and c a are two alge braically closed fields with the same characteristic c 6 p and g admits a set of ca types satisfying unicity exhaustion and aut ca stability then g also admits a list of c a types satisfying the same properties our other main results concern supercuspidality an irreducible smooth c representation of g is supercuspidal if it is not a subquotient of a representation parabolically induced from a proper levi subgroup of g 55 this notion of supercuspidality also makes sense for finite reductive groups the explicit cuspidal ca types j considered above involve cuspidal ca representations of finite reductive groups more precisely j has two normal open subgroups j 1 j 0 and the quotient j 0 j 1 is naturally a finite reductive group the restriction of to j 0 is constructed as a tensor product of an irreducible ca representation of j 0 which we call here a preferred extension see 6 1 for detail and a ca representation of j 0 trivial on j 1 inflated from a cuspidal representation of j 0 j 1 we say accordingly that is supercuspidal if the irreducible components of are inflated from supercuspidal representations of the finite reductive group j 0 j 1 for a cuspidal c type j obtained via theorem 1 1 we say that is supercuspidal if the irreducible components of ca c which are cuspidal c a types are supercuspidal theorem 1 3 let j be a cuspidal c type in g then is supercuspidal if and only if indgj is supercuspidal in the following cases j has level 0 c is algebraically closed j is in the list of cuspidal c types of g gl n f or g is a classical group and p is odd or g splits over a tame galois extension of f and p is odd and 4 guy henniart marie france vign ras does not divide the order of the absolute weyl group of g constructed by bushnell kutzko 12 minguez s cherre 38 or kurinczuk skodlerack stevens 34 or yu 59 fintzen 26 2 to prove theorem 1 3 we use injective hulls indeed if is an irreduciblec representation of a finite reductive group and i is an injective hull of then is supercuspidal if and only if i is cuspidal in practice we work with representations whose restriction to a maximal torsion free subgroup z of the centre z of g is a multiple of a fixed irreducible c representation in that setting we show that if an injective hull i of is cuspidal then ind g j i is cuspidal with the same length as i and is an injective hull and a projective cover of ind g j in the reverse direction we show that if i is cuspidal then i is supercuspidal when the second adjointness holds then is supercuspidal if and only if i is cuspidal and we get theorems 5 1 and 6 10 for a cuspidal c type j in g of level 0 or satisfying the properties i to vi of 6 1 if is supercuspidal then indgj is the converse is true if j has level 0 or if j satisfies also the property vii of 6 1 and g c satisfies the second adjunction this result implies theorem 1 3 indeed dat proved the second adjointness for level 0 representations and for the groups g gl n f the classical groups of stevens and the moderately ramified groups of fintzen yu we check that the properties i to vii of 6 1 are satisfied by the cuspidal ca types in g when g is gl n d a classical group as in 37 and p 6 2 a quaternionic form of such a classical group a moderately ramified connected reductive group and p not dividing the order of the absolute weyl group constructed by bushnell kutzko 12 minguez s cherre 38 kurinczuk skodlerack stevens 34 skodlerak 50 51 yu 59 the layout of the paper is the following in section 2 we recall useful consequences of the decomposition theorem of 31 when v is a simple module over a unital c algebra a with finite dimensional commutant it describes the submodule structure of ca c as a module over ca c a section 3 collects facts about various functors on the category of smooth c representations of a locally profinite group g also we derive from section 2 a procedure to produce cuspidal c types in g from cuspidal ca types in section 4 we first show that all irreducible smooth c representations of g g f are admissible and that our procedure applies to such g moreover we show that good sets of cuspidal types can be transferred from one algebraically closed field to another of the same characteristic then we show aut ca stability for the level 0 cuspidal ca types yielding corresponding lists of c types the more technical case of positive level cuspidal ca types is treated at the end of section 6 in section 5 we investigate the notion of supercuspidality and we prove that a level 0 cuspidal c type j is supercuspidal if and only if indgj is supercuspidal section 6 is devoted to the explicit ca types of theorem 1 2 we show the properties i to vi of 6 1 and aut ca stability for them and the property vii for some of them to get theorem 1 3 part of this paper was presented in carthage at the conference organized by ahmed abbes in june 2019 it is a pleasure to thank muic fintzen aubert s cherre stevens abbes and the participants of the carthage conference and of imj prg for their contribution or stimulating interest 2 this case is conditional on the verification of the second adjunction by dat representations of a reductive p adic group in characteristic distinct from p 5 notation throughout the paper p is a prime number c is a field with characteristic c different from p unless mentioned otherwise and ca is an algebraic closure of c all c algebras are assumed to be associative aut c is the group of field automorphisms of c and autc c a is the group of automorphisms of ca fixing c in section 3 g is a locally profinite group most often with a compact open subgroup of pro order invertible in c and z is a closed central subgroup of g we write modc g for the category of smooth c representations of g and irrc g modc g for the family of irreducible representations in sections 4 to 6 g g f where f is a non archimedean local field with finite residue characteristic p g is a connected reductive f group and z is the centre of g of maximal compact subgroup z 0 and z a finitely generated torsion free subgroup as usual of is the ring of integers of f pf the maximal ideal of of o f the group of units of of and kf of pf the residual field 2 the decomposition theorem let a be a unital c algebra and v a simple a module such that d enda v has finite dimension over c the decomposition theorem 31 theorem 1 1 analyzes the structure of c c v as a module over c c a when c is any normal extension of c containing a maximal subfield of d its lattice of submodules is isomorphic to the lattice of right ideals in the artinian ring c c d in particular c c v has finite length we shall mostly use the following consequences drawn in 31 when c ca theorem 2 1 a let v be a simple a module with dimc enda v finite then the ca ca module c a cv has finite length a simple subquotient of c a cv is also isomorphic to a submodule and to a quotient it is absolutely simple and defined over a finite extension of c the isomorphism classes of simple subquotients form a finite orbit under autc c a b an absolutely simple ca c a module w which is defined over a finite extension of c is a subquotient of ca c v for some simple a module v with dimc enda v finite the a module v is determined up to isomorphism by the property that w is v isotypic 3 as an a module the theorem implies that the map sending v to the set of irreducible subquotients of ca c v induces a bijection from the set of isomorphism classes of simple a modules with endomorphism ring of finite c dimension to the set of orbits under autc c a of absolutely simple ca c a modules defined over a finite extension of c for any extension c c we putac c ca anac module isomorphic to c cv for an a module v is said to be defined over c if v is simple then c cenda v endac c cv 31 rem ii 2 an a module v is said to be absolutely simple if the ac module c c v is simple for any extension c c as a consequence of theorem 2 1 a simple a module v with enda v c is absolutely simple the converse is true 31 rem ii 3 in particular a simple aca module of finite ca dimension is absolutely simple lemma 2 2 i let v be a simple a module with d enda v of finite c dimension and let c c be an extension contained in d then c c v is a simple ac module if and only if c c 3 w is a direct sum of modiules isomorphic to v 6 guy henniart marie france vign ras ii an a module v such that d enda v has finite c dimension is absolutely simple if and only if c c v is a simple c c a module for all finite extensions c c proof ii is a consequence of i by theorem 2 1 we prove i if c c v is a simple c c a module then c c d endc ca c c v is a division c algebra of finite dimension containing c c c an integral c algebra of finite dimension is a field so c cc is a field but c cc is a field if and only if c c the multiplication x y 7 xy is a quotient map c c c c hence is an isomorphism and c c remark 2 3 let v be a simple a module with endomorphism ring d endav and b a a central subalgebra containing the unit let e be the image of b in endc v then e lies in the centre of d in the special case where v is a finitely generated b module then e is a field and v is a finite dimensional e vector space 5 3 3 corollary 2 of proposition 3 that applies in particular when b a in which case dime v 1 in general at least e is integral assume now that d has finite c dimension then e is a commutative finite dimensional c algebra and being an integral domain it is necessarily a field hence is a finite extension of c the algebra b acts on v via its quotient field e which is a simple b module and v as a b module is e isotypic in the case that a c g for a group g and b c z where z g is a central subgroup we see that v is a simple e g module z acting by an homomorphism z e we now give a kind of converse to theorem 2 1 which will be used in proposition 3 13 proposition 2 4 let v be an a module such that enda v is a division algebra assume that the ca c a module c a c v has finite length and that all its simple subquotients are absolutely simple and their isomorphism classes form an orbit under autc c a then v is simple and enda v has finite dimension over c proof let u be a simple a subquotient of v as an a module ca c u is a direct sum of modules isomorphic to u hence each simple subquotient of ca c u is as an a module a direct sum of modules isomorphic to u since the isomorphism classes of the simple subquo tients of ca c v form an orbit under autc c a they are also the simple subquotients of ca c u as an a module c a c v is a direct sum of modules isomorphic to v therefore the simple a subquotients of v are isomorphic to u since the ca c a module c a c v has finite length the a module v has finite length too as u occurs as an a submodule and a a quotient of v there exists an a endomorphism of v of image u as enda v is a division algebra any non zero a endomorphism of v is surjective therefore v u is simple since ca c v has finite length and that all its simple subquotients are absolutely simple endca a c a c v has finite dimension over c a this is also the dimension of enda v over c 3 smooth c representations of locally profinite groups let g be a locally profinite group z a closed central subgroup of g and c a field definition 3 1 we say that z is almost finitely generated when z z 0 is finitely generated for some open compact subgroup z 0 z this property does not depend on the choice of z 0 representations of a reductive p adic group in characteristic distinct from p 7 a c representation v of g is called smooth if every vector in v has open stabilizer in g and v is called admissible if moreover the subspace v j of j invariant vectors of v has finite dimension for any open subgroup j of g note that a c representation v of g generated by v j for some j is smooth as gv is fixed by gjg 1 for g g v v we write modc g for the category of smooth c representations of g and irrc g for the family of irreducible smooth c representations of g a homomorphism g c is called a c character of g the c characters of g act on the c representations of g respecting irreducibility if v is a c representation of g then g 7 g g for g g gives a c representation of g on v written and called the twist of by that action is compatible with morphisms of representations so we also get an action written in the same way on isomorphism classes of c g modules the smooth characters i e with open kernel act on the smooth representations of g and on their isomorphism classes 3 1 invariants under an open subgroup let j g be an open subgroup the functor v v j from c representations of g to c vector spaces is left exact and exact if j is compact and has pro order invertible in c if v is irreducible we get a ring homomorphism d endc g v endc v j which is injective if v j 6 0 because d is a division algebra in particular if dimc v j is finite so is dimc d and we can apply section 2 to v in that case z acts via a quotient field of c z finite over c remark 2 3 so z acts via a character if c is algebraically closed we conclude that we can apply section 2 to an irreducible admissible c representation of g in fact the functor v v j gives a functor from c representations of g to modules over the hecke c algebra hc g j of j in g in order to get left modules hc g j is defined as the opposite of the c algebra endc g c g j the following is well known when c c is the field of complex numbers and the proofs in 9 1 4 3 proof of proposition 2 carry over to any field c theorem 3 2 let j g be an open compact subgroup with pro order invertible in c i if v is an irreducible c representation of g with v j 6 0 then v is smooth and v j is a simple hc g j module ii let m be a simple hc g j module then the c g module xm c g j hc g j m is smooth has a unique largest submodule x m not intersecting 1 m and the quotient ym xm x m is an irreducible smooth c representation of g the map sending m m to the image in ym of 1 m gives an isomorphism m y j m of hc g j modules iii if v is an irreducible c representation of g such that v j 6 0 then taking m v j the natural map xm v induces an isomorphism ym v that theorem gives an explicit bijection between isomorphism classes of irreducible smooth c representations ofg with non zero j invariants and isomorphism classes of simplehc g j modules corollary 3 3 let v irrc g with v j 6 0 then the natural map endc g v endhc g j v j is an isomorphism that result was already established in 44 theorem 4 1 when c q is the field of rational numbers 8 guy henniart marie france vign ras proof we already remarked that the map is injective let a endhc g j v j then a induces an endomorphism of the c g module xm where m v j which preserves x m hence induces b endc g v by iii of the theorem by construction b induces a on m v j remark 3 4 let v irrc g with v j 6 0 and dimc v j finite by the corollary we can apply section 2 to the c g module v and also to the hc g j module v j we get parallel results in particular the map w w j gives an isomorphism of the lattice of subrepresentations of ca c v onto the lattice of hc g j submodules of c a c v j let us consider an extension c c if v is a c g module the inclusion c cv j c cv induces an isomorphism c c v j c c v j it is an isomorphism of hc g j modules clearly if v is an irreducible c g module defined over c with v j 6 0 then the hc g j module v j is also defined over c conversely corollary 3 5 let c c be an extension let v irrc g with v j 6 0 if the hc g j module v j is defined over c then v is defined over c proof let m be an hc g j module such that c c m v j then m is necessarily simple because v j is by i of the theorem consider the irreducible c representation ym of g of j invariants isomorphic to m then c c ym j v j and by iii of the theorem c c ym v hence v is defined over c 3 2 irreducible c representations of g with finite dimension in this subsection we assume that g z is compact proposition 3 6 let v be a finitely generated smooth c representation of g then v is trivial on an open subgroup if v is irreducible and z is almost finitely generated definition 3 1 then dimc v is finite the second assertion will be generalized proposition 3 8 proof let s be a finite set generating v for v v the g stabilizer jv of v is an open subgroup of g for g g jgv gjvg 1 and depends only on gzjv so because g z is compact there are only finitely many open subgroups jgv for g g v s their intersection is therefore an open subgroup of g acting trivially on v moreover v is a finitely generated module over c z as g z is compact and v is a finitely generated c g module with an open subgroup of g acting trivially if z is almost finitely generated then any quotient field of c z has finite c dimension and the second assertion is a consequence of remark 2 3 corollary 3 7 when z is almost finitely generated any v irrca g has finite dimension is absolutely irreducible and is defined over a finite extension of c proof endca g v c a and z acts on v via a character the values of that character generate a finite extension e of c in ca since z is almost finitely generated on the other hand an open subgroup of g acts trivially on v so we may assume that g z is finite taking representatives gi for g z the matrix coefficients of the action of the g is on a basis of v generate a finite extension c of c in ca and we see that v is defined over ec 3 3 z compactness in this subsection we assume that g contains an open compact subgroup with pro order invertible in c for each such subgroup j g we then have a canonical projector ej which acts on any smooth c representation v of g it is j equivariant and has image ejv v j representations of a reductive p adic group in characteristic distinct from p 9 a smooth c representation v of g is called z compact 55 i 7 3 and 7 11 if for all small enough open compact subgroups j g and all v v the support of the function g ejgv is z compact i e compact modulo z when z is trivial we say compact instead of z compact it is clear that a subrepresentation of a z compact smooth c representation of g is z compact and a quotient representation is also it is known that a compact finitely generated smooth c representation of g is admissible 55 i 7 4 let us analyze the situation in general let v modc g and j an open compact subgroup of g with pro order invertible in c let v v and v v the subrepresentation of v generated by v then the vector space v v j is generated by the ejgv g g if v is z compact the function g ejgv vanishes outside a finite number of double cosets jgzjv where jv g is the g stabilizer of v in particular v v j is a finitely generated c z module more generally if v is z compact and w is a finitely generated subrepresentation of v then w j is finitely generated over c z if c z acts on w via a quotient a with dimc a finite then w j is finite dimensional proposition 3 8 assume that z is almost finitely generated then any z compact v irrc g is admissible wheng z is compact all smooth c representations of g are z compact so the proposition does generalize the last assertion of proposition 3 6 proof choose a non zero vector v v and j g a compact open subgroup with pro order invertible in c fixing v by the above the simple hc g j module v j is finitely generated over c z since z is almost finitely generated reasoning as for proposition 3 6 gives that v j has finite dimension remark 3 9 1 assume that z is almost finitely generated if there exists a z compact irreducible smooth representation v of g of finite dimension over c we claim that g z is compact indeed since v is smooth of finite dimension an open normal subgroup in g acts trivially on v and dividing by this subgroup we may assume g discrete taking now j trivial in the property of z compactness we see that that gv 6 0 only for g in a finite number of z cosets but that implies that g z is finite 2 assume that v irrc g is z compact then the image a of c z in the division algebra d endc g v is an integral domain so has a fraction field e d since d stabilizes v j a and e stabilizes v j too by the above v j is finitely generated over a so dime v j is finite if dimc a or equivalenly dimc e is finite then dimc v j is finite 3 let c be an extension of c and let v modc g then c c v modc g and v is z compact if and only if c c v is z compact the space of linear forms l v c invariant under an open subgroup of g with the natural action gl gv l v for v v g g of g is a smooth representation v modc g called the contragredient of v 55 i 7 1 as g contains a compact open subgroup of pro order invertible in c the contragredient functor v 7 v modc g modc g is exact 55 4 18 proposition i the three properties v admissible v admissible the natural map v v is bijective are equivalent and when v is admissible then v is irreducible if and only if v is 55 i 4 18 proposition iii and v a smooth coefficient of v modc g is a function g l gv from g to c for v v l v proposition 3 10 let v modc g then v is z compact if and only if the support of any smooth coefficient of v is z compact 10 guy henniart marie france vign ras proof that is already established with compact instead of z compact in 55 i 7 3 proposition c it is clear that if v is z compact then any smooth coefficient of v is z compact let us prove the converse fix v v to prove that the support of the function g ejgv is z compact for all compact open subgroups j g with pro order invertible in c we may as well assume that j fixes v and that v generates v for each double coset x jhzj h g let v x v j the subspace generated by the ejhzv for z z then v j is the sum of the v x because v generates v let x be the set of cosets x such that v x 6 0 the goal is to show that x is finite by the hypothesis on coefficients any linear form on v j which can be uniquely extended to a linear form on v fixed by j vanishes outside a finite number of subspaces v x for each x x let us choose a non zero vector vx v x extract from the family vx x x a maximal linearly independent subfamily vx x y with y x there is a linear form on v j taking value 1 at each vx for x y which implies that y is finite by our hypothesis on coefficients so the family vx x x generates a finite dimensional subspace w v j choose a basis of w homc w c each element of that basis vanishes on vx for all x x except for finitely many so the vx are 0 except finitely many which finally shows that x is finite as desired remark 3 11 let v modc g admissible from proposition 3 10 v is z compact if and only if v is if v is also irreducible then v is z compact if and only if the support of some smooth coefficient of v is z compact 3 4 compact induction in the setting of the introduction all known constructions of cuspidal irreducible c representations of g f are for c algebraically closed and are obtained via compact induction we now investigate the situation without assuming c algebraically closed let j g be a subgroup the functor c g c j from c j modules to c g modules is exact because c g is a free c j module and faithful it is left adjoint to the restriction functor resgj it is obviously compatible with scalar extension through a field extension c c in particular it is compatible with the action of aut c and with the action of c characters of g on c g modules in the sense that if is a c character of g and a c j module then c g c j c g c j j we now assume that j is open in that case the previous functor restricts to a functor modc j modc g we rather use the isomorphic functor of compact induction 55 i 5 7 denoted indgj modc j modc g while the smooth induction from j to g is denoted by indgj modc j modc g 55 i 5 1 if v modc j we thus get a ring homomorphism 3 1 endc j v endc g ind g j v which is injective by faithfulness it is rarely surjective though even when v is irreducible by adjunction endc g ind g j v homc j v res g j ind g j v and res g j ind g j v decomposes as a direct sum over double cosets jgj of the representation of j on the space ind jgj j v of functions in indgj v with support in jgj 3 2 resgj ind g j v jgj ind jgj j v the trivial coset j yields a representation of j naturally isomorphic to v and accounts for the embedding 3 1 the embedding is an isomorphism if and only if no non trivial coset contributes note that indgj v can be admissible only if v is and finitely many cosets contribute representations of a reductive p adic group in characteristic distinct from p 11 let us analyze a more general situation let j be another open subgroup of g and v modc j by adjunction homc g ind g j v indgj v homc j v resgj ind g j v res g j ind g j v jgj ind jgj j v consequently homc j v resgj ind g j v sits between the direct sum and the direct product of the homc j v ind jgj j v more precisely it is made out of the collections of jgj homc j v ind jgj j v such that for v v jgj v 0 except for a finite number of double cosets jgj in g 4 note that we have an isomorphism 3 3 homc j v ind jgj j v homc j g 1 jg v gv which associates to the map v 7 v 1 where gv is the representation of g 1 jg on v via g 1 hg v 7 hv let us recall what intertwining means let g be a group and h k subgroups of g let be a c representation of h on a space v and a c representation of k on a space w for g g a map homc v w such that k g 1 kg for k k ghg 1 is called a g intertwiner of with the space i g of g intertwiners of with is 3 4 homc ghg 1 k v g w homc h g 1 kg v gw where v g g 1 v is the g conjugate of v the representation of ghg 1 on v via ghg 1 v 7 hv we say that g intertwines with if i g 6 0 this is equivalent to saying that the set kgh supports a non zero function f g homc v w such that f kgh k f g h for k k h h indeed the map f 7 f g is an isomorphism from the space of such functions to the space of g interwiners when g interwines with we simply say that g intertwines the set of g g which interwines is called the g intertwining of the g normalizer of is the k intertwining of where k is the g normalizer of h an immediate but important remark is that the action of aut c preserves intertwining indeed let aut c then v c v identifies with v by 1 v corresponding to v the action of c c on 1 v corresponding to the action of c 1 on v as c v 1 1 c v clearly a g intertwiner of with identifies with a g intertwiner of with 3 5 i g i g recall that indgj v is contained in the smooth induced representation ind g j v and that indgj v is naturally isomorphic to indgj v remark 3 12 assuming that g has a compact open subgroup of pro order invertible in c let us briefly tackle the issue of admissibility a if indgj v is admissible so is v because j g is open and v res g j ind g j v b assume v admissible so v is admissible and v v adapting the reasoning in 8 see also 55 i 2 8 one proves that the following conditions are equivalent i indgj v is admissible ii indgj v is admissible iii ind g j v ind g j v if those conditions are satisfied for v they are also satisfied for v in particular indgj v indgj v and all smooth coefficients of indgj v have support contained in a finite number of cosets jg consequently their support is z compact if j contains z with j z compact and then indgj v is z compact 4 the reader should be aware of slightly incorrect statements in 55 i 8 3 preuve i ii and 36 remark 2 1 12 guy henniart marie france vign ras our main interest goes to cases where indgj v is irreducible which can only happen when v is let us assume then that v is irreducible let ng j v be the g normalizer of j v made out of the elements in the g normalizer of j which transform v into an isomorphic representation of j in general the intermediate induction ind ng j v j v is not irreducible so to ensure that indgj v be irreducible it is better to assume that j contains the centre of g for g ng j v the coset gj jgj contributes to endc g ind g j v if the embedding endc j v endc g ind g j v 3 1 is an isomorphism then ng j v j for v irreducible and v a an irreducible subquotient of ca c v we derive information on indgj v from ind g j v a using section 2 when endc j v has finite c dimension proposition 3 13 let v irrc j such that endc j v has finite dimension let v a irrca j be a subquotient of c a c v the following two conditions are equivalent i the embedding endc j v endc g ind g j v 3 1 is an isomorphism ii the embedding homca j v a v a homca g ind g j v a indgj v a is an isomor phism for any autc c a assume that indgj v a is absolutely irreducible and that indgj v a indgj v a only if v a v a for autc c a then i holds true and indgj v is irreducible proof condition i means that homc j v ind jgj j v 0 for any non trivial coset jgj similarly condition ii means that homca j v a ind jgj j v a 0 for any non trivial coset jgj and any autc c a let us fix g g because v is irreducible homca j c a c v ind jgj j c a c v ca chomc j v ind jgj j v from theorem 2 1 the irreducible subquotients of c a cv have the form v a for autc c a and each of them is isomorphic to a subrepresentation of ca c v and also a quotient we deduce the equivalence of the four properties 1 homc j v ind jgj j v 6 0 2 homca j c a c v ind jgj j c a c v 6 0 3 there exist autc c a such that homca j v a ind jgj j v a 6 0 4 there exists autc c a such that homca j v a ind jgj j v a 6 0 therefore conditions i and ii are equivalent assume now that indgj v a is absolutely irreducible and that indgj v a indgj v a only if v a v a for autc c a by the decomposition theorem 2 1 there is a finite normal extension c of c such that c c v achieves the length of c a c v and such v a is defined over c so indgj v a is also defined over c by assumption indgj v a is absolutely irreducible so all the irreducible subquotients of indgj c a c v which are its autc c a conjugates are absolutely irreducible as well it follows also that the length of indgj c a c v is the same as that of ca c v which by the decomposition theorem 2 1 is finite the other part of the assumption implies that condition ii is satisfied hence also condition i consequently we can apply proposition 2 4 to indgj v and we get that it is simple remark 3 14 assume that all conditions in the proposition are satisfied then applying the decomposition theorem 2 1 to v or indgj v gives parallel results in particular compact induction from j to g gives an isomorphism from the lattice of subrepresentations of ca c v to the lattice of subrepresentations of ca c ind g j v 3 5 c types representations of a reductive p adic group in characteristic distinct from p 13 definition 3 15 a c type in g is a pair j v where j g is an open subgroup and v an isomorphism class of irreducible smooth c representations of j such that indgj v is irreducible it is called z compact if z j and j z is compact it is said to have finite dimension if dimc v is finite to be defined over a subfield c of c if v is defined over c warning that is not the usual definition of types when g g f 14 it is simply a convenient one for us we can take j g in particular the group aut c acts on the set of c types in g by its action on the component v of the pair also g acts on that set by conjugation the two actions respect z compact types when j v is a c type in g and j is a subgroup of g containing j the transitivity of the compact induction indgj v ind g j ind j j v shows that ind j j v is irreducible so j indj j v is a c type in g which is z compact if j v is and j has finite index in j definition 3 16 a c type j v in g is said to satisfy intertwining if the homomorphism endc j v endc g ind g j v 3 1 is an isomorphism definition 3 17 let x be a set of c types in g the set x satisfies intertwining if each element of x does it satisfies unicity if for j v j x such that indgj v ind g j v there is g g conjugating j to j let z be a set of isomorphism classes of irreducible z compact smooth c representations of g the set x satisfies z exhaustion if for j v x the isomorphism class of indgj v is in z and any element of z has that form let aut c the set x is stable if for j v x then j v is also in x x is said to satisfy unicity when moreover indgj v ind g j v implies v v let h aut c be a subgroup the set x is h stable if it is stable for any h it satisfies h unicity if it satisfies unicity for any h proposition 3 18 let x be a set of c types in g let x denote the set of c types j v where j is the g normalizer of j and v the isomorphism class of indj j v let z and h be as in definition 3 17 if x satisfies intertwining resp unicity resp z exhaustion h stability then so does x if x satisfies unicity and h stability then x satisfies h unicity proof the composite of the natural maps endc j v endc j ind j j v endc g ind g j v is 3 1 the assertion for intertwining follows the assertion for unicity comes from the fact that if g g conjugates j v to j 1 v 1 then it also conjugates j indj j v to j 1 ind j 1 j 1 v the assertion for z exhaustion comes from transitivity of induction the assertion for h stability is due to the fact that compact induction is compatible with the action of aut c let us assume that x satisfies unicity and h stability and let j v x and h be such that indgj v ind g j v by unicity there is g g conjugating j v to j v but then g is in the g normalizer j of j so indj j v ind j j v 3 6 from ca types to c types when g is a reductive group with centre z as in the introduction many lists of ca types j v are known our purpose is to produce c types from ca types we now describe a general procedure using proposition 3 13 we start from a set ya of ca types j v a in g such that a each v a is absolutely irreducible and defined over a finite extension of c by corollary 3 7 that is automatic if the types in ya are z compact 14 guy henniart marie france vign ras b ya satisfies intertwining unicity autc c a stability and autc c a unicity we let za be the set of isomorphism classes of the c representations indgj v a for j v a ya those representations are absolutely irreducible because v a is and ya satisfies in tertwining defined over a finite extension of c because v a is and za is stable under autc c a let j v a ya there is a unique isomorphism class v of smooth irreduciblec representations of j such that v a is a subquotient of ca c v theorem 2 1 and endc j v has finite di mension over c lemma 3 19 the pair j v is a c type in g satisfying intertwining proof we see that indgj v a indgj v a only if v a v a for autc c a since ya satisfies unicity autc c a stability and autc c a unicity proposition 3 13 gives the result from the set ya of ca types j v a in g we therefore get a set y of c types j v in g satisfying intertwining note that za is the set of isomorphism classes of irreducible subquotients of ca c w for w in the set z of isomorphim classes of ind g j v irrc g for j v y proposition 3 20 the set y of c types in g satisfies intertwining and unicity if ya satisfies aut ca stability and aut ca unicity then y satisfies aut c stability and aut c unicity proof that the set y satisfies intertwining comes from the lemma let j v and j v in y be such that indgj v and ind g j v are isomorphic let v a be the class of an irreducible subquotient of ca c v and choose similarly v a they belong to ya and since indgj v ind g j v we have indgj v a indgj v a for some autc c a since ya satisfies unicity v a and v a are conjugate by some g g so that v and v are also conjugate by g that proves that y satisfies unicity assume now that ya satisfies aut ca stability and aut ca unicity let j v y and aut c there is an extension of to an automorphism a of ca 4 4 no 3 corollary 2 of theorem 2 if c ca is the embedding then a and ca c v c a v a ca c v if v a is the class of an irreducible subquotient of ca c v then j v a ya and because ya satisfies aut ca stability j a v a is also in ya and it follows that j v y proving that y satisfies aut c stability let now aut c be such that indgj v ind g j v choosing v a and a as before we have see that indgj v a and indgj a v a are conjugate under autc c a and changing a we may assume that they are isomorphic but ya satisfies aut ca unicity so v a a v a and it follows that v v that proves that y satisfies aut c unicity 4 cuspidal types in reductive groups in this section f is a non archimedean local field with finite residual characteristic p c is a field of characteristic c 6 p of algebraic closure ca g is a connected reductive f group of centre z with rank nz the dimension of a maximal f split subtorus g g f and z is a closed subgroup of z z f with compact quotient z z for example z z representations of a reductive p adic group in characteristic distinct from p 15 the group g contains an open pro p subgroup the compact subgroups of g generate an open and normal subgroup g 0 and the quotient g g 0 a finitely generated free abelian group the maximal compact subgroup z 0 of z is z g 0 the injective homomorphism z z 0 g g 0 has finite cokernel similarly the maximal compact subgroup z 0 of z is z g 0 and the injective homomorphism z z 0 g g 0 has finite cokernel as z z is compact the groups z and z are almost finitely generated definition 3 1 and are the product of their maximal compact subgroup by a non unique subgroup isomorphic to znz we can choose z isomorphic to znz we can choose z trivial if and only if nz 0 for a parabolic subgroup p of g with levi decomposition p mn of rational points p mn we will say that p is a parabolic subgroup of g the unnormalized parabolic induction indgp modc m modc g is faithful and exact with a left adjoint the n coinvariant functor n and a right adjoint rgp 57 this implies that n is right exact and r g p is left exact as c 6 p n is exact 55 i 4 10 and the second adjunction conjecture says that r g p is equivalent to p n where p is the modulus of p the equivalence is a celebrated result of bernstein when c is the complex field and a theorem of dat 17 proposition 6 3 theorem 9 2 when g is gl n f or is a classical p adic group and p 6 2 it is also true for any g for the restriction of the functors to the subcategories of level 0 representations see below 4 4 for that notion when g is the group of points of a connected reductive group over a finite field of character istic p we will say simply that g is a finite reductive group in characteristic p the parabolic induction indgp is faithful and exact of left adjoint n and right adjoint the n invariant functor n 45 proposition 3 1 as c 6 p there exists an idempotent e c n such that ev v n for v modc g 55 4 9 proposition a and r g p is equivalent to n this is the form of the second adjunction 4 1 review on cuspidal representations the definitions and results in this subsection are valid also for finite reductive groups definition 4 1 55 2 2 2 3 a representation modc g is called cuspidal if n 0 for all proper parabolic subgroups p mn of g equivalently by adjunction is cuspidal if homc g ind g p 0 for all proper parabolic subgroups p mn of g and modc m remark 4 2 when is irreducible one can restrict to irreducible irrc g is cuspidal if and only if homc g ind g p 0 for all proper parabolic subgroups p mn of g and irrc m 55 ii 2 4 remark 4 3 we note that n 0 if and only if for any element v there exists an open compact subgroup nv of n such that envv 0 where env nv is the projection on the nv invariants 55 i 4 6 this remark will be used in proposition 6 7 remark 4 4 what we call cuspidal here is called left cuspidal in 2 definition 6 3 2 3 be cause there is a symmetric notion which we call right cuspidal where one asks rgp 0 for all proper parabolic subgroups p mn of g or equivalently by adjunction homc g ind g p 0 for all proper parabolic subgroups p mn and modc m of course when the second adjunction holds true in particular for level 0 representations these notions are equivalent 16 guy henniart marie france vign ras without assuming the second adjunction we will verify in proposition 4 10 iii their equiv alence for admissible representations we are lead naturally to the notion of supercuspidality for semi simple representations definition 4 5 55 ii 2 5 an irreducible smooth c representation of g is called super cuspidal if it is not isomorphic to a subquotient of indgp for all proper parabolic subgroups p mn g and modc m a semi simple smooth c representation of g is supercuspidal if each irreducible compo nent of is supercuspidal clearly supercuspidal implies left cuspidal and right cuspidal the converse is not true when c is the prime field of characteristic dividing p 1 the principal series of gl 2 qp induced by the trivial c character of the diagonal torus has a cuspidal non supercuspidal subquotient lemma 4 6 an irreducible quotient of a projective cuspidal representation v is supercus pidal this will be used in the proof of proposition 6 7 we will see that all known irreducible supercuspidal representations are of this form theorems 5 10 5 11 6 12 proof if is a subquotient of a parabolically induced representation indgp for a proper parabolic subgroup p mn of g and a smooth c representation of m then indgp contains a subrepresentation w of quotient as v is projective of quotient there is a non zero c g map v w any quotient of a cuspidal representation is cuspidal and indgp does not contains a cuspidal representation hence a contradiction remark 4 7 one does not need to consider all modc m in definition 4 5 it suffices to take c kn m for all kn in some decreasing sequence of pro p open subgroups of m with trivial intersection indeed modc m is an abelian grothendieck category with generator nc kn m 57 lemma 3 2 and the functor ind g p is exact and commutes with direct sums it has a right adjoint and 34 remark after proposition 2 2 10 remark 4 8 in the definition of supercuspidality of irrc g one can suppose irreducible when g satisfies the second adjunction or when has level 0 a theorem of dat 18 theorem 1 1 or when g is finite as c m has finite length such an assumption is forgotten but used in the proof in 55 ii 2 6 remark 4 9 assume only for this remark that c p when g z is not compact the trivial representation is right cuspidal and not left cuspidal 2 an irreducible representation may be not admissible a definition of supercuspidality 1 for c algebraically closed 2 in general is given for admissible irreducible c representations of g is called supercuspidal if it is not isomorphic to a subquotient of indgp for all proper parabolic subgroups p mn g and all admissible irreducible c representations of m proposition 4 10 i indgp indgp p for all parabolic subgroups p mn of g and modc m ii let modc g then is z compact is cuspidal is right cuspidal iii if is admissible then n n for p mn opposite to p with respect to m is cuspidal is right cuspidal representations of a reductive p adic group in characteristic distinct from p 17 iv let irrc g and g c a smooth c character of g then indgp for some p mn and irrc m cuspidal is admissible is cuspidal is cuspidal is cuspidal is supercuspidal is supercuspidal is supercuspidal v any irreducible smooth ca representation of g is absolutely irreducible proof for i iii except for cuspidal right cuspidal and for iv except for the last line we refer to 55 i 4 18 iii i 5 11 ii 2 1 vi ii 2 4 ii 2 7 ii 2 8 where the proof does not use the assumption that c is algebraically closed ii 2 9 we have cuspidal right cuspidal hence ii because i and 55 i 4 13 homc g ind g p homc g ind g p homc g ind g p p and homc g ind g p 6 0 implies homc g ind g p 6 0 if is admissible we deduce cuspidal right cuspidal ending the proof of iii indeeed and is cuspidal if and only if is cuspidal as n n we prove the last line of iv as indgp ind g p m it is clear that super cuspidal super cuspidal if is non supercuspidal it is a quotient of a subrepresentation y of indgp for some proper parabolic subgroup p mn of g and modc m taking the contragredient which is exact y is a quotient of indgp containing and as indgp indgp p we see that is non supercuspidal as the reverse is true v the intertwining algebra of is a finite extension of ca hence is equal to ca because is admissible by iv therefore is absolutely irreducible remarks following theorem 2 1 proposition 4 11 let c c be an extension let irrc g and irrc g an irre ducible subquotient of c c then is supercuspidal if and only if is similarly for cuspidal proof a let p mn be a parabolic subgroup of g and modc m if is a subquotient of indgp then is a subquotient of indgp c c as ind g p commutes with scalar extension therefore supercuspidal implies supercuspidal b conversely if is a subquotient of indgp c kn m remark 4 7 then is a subquo tient of indgp c kn m because as c representations is isotypic and indgp c kn m is isomorphic to a direct sum of indgp c kn m therefore supercuspidal implies su percuspidal c similarly for quotient and right cuspidal replacing subquotient and supercuspidal in a and b hence is right cuspidal if and only if is as right cuspidal cuspidal for an irreducible representation proposition 4 10 is cuspidal if and only if is the next proposition is used in the proof of proposition 4 24 proposition 4 12 the scalar extension and the parabolic induction respect finite length proof let c c be an extension and irrc g let p mn a parabolic subgroup of g and irrc m we show that the lengths of c c and of ind g p are finite the scalar extension and the parabolic induction being exact this implies the proposition a the dimension of endc g is finite as is admissible proposition 4 10 iv the length of c c is finite bounded by the length of c a c by 31 corollary i 2 18 guy henniart marie france vign ras b it is already known that the length of indgp is finite when c is algebraically closed 55 5 13 the parabolic induction commutes with scalar extension and by a ca c has finite length hence the length of indgp c a c c a c ind g p is finite a fortiori the length of indgp is finite 4 2 cuspidal type compared to the case of a general locally profinite group z compact c types in g definition 3 15 and irreducible smooth c representations of g have peculiar features proposition 4 13 i a z compact c type in g has finite dimension ii a z compact ca type in g is defined over a finite extension of c iii if j v is a z compact c type in g the representation indgj v irrc g is cuspidal and indgj v ind g j v iv a z compact ca type j v in g is absolutely irreducible and so is indgj v in particular j v satisfies intertwining proof i proposition 3 6 ii corollary 3 7 iii any coefficient of v extended by 0 is a coefficient of indgj v with z compact support by remark 3 11 indgj v irrc g is z compact by proposition 4 10 ii ind g j v is cuspidal by remark 3 12 b indgj v ind g j v iv when j v is a z compact ca type in g then v is irreducible of finite ca dimension proposition 3 6 so v is absolutely irreducible the irreducible representation indgj v is admissible proposition 4 10 iv so is absolutely irreducible the commutant of an absolutely irreducible ca representation is ca definition 4 14 a z compact c type in g definition 3 15 is called a cuspidal c type in g the definition is motivated by proposition 4 13 iv a cuspidal c type in g satisfies intertwining when c is algebraically closed proposition 4 13 iii but not in general example 4 15 take c r and a quaternion division algebra d over q 3 we construct an example of r type j in d which does not satisfy intertwining let h be the hamilton quaternion algebra and u the quaternion subgroup of order 8 generated by the order 4 elements i j ij ji the left multiplication by u on h gives an irreducible r representation of u if t is the subgroup of u generated by i and the 2 dimensional representation of t on r i then indut the commutant of is r i and the commutant of is h we show that u is a quotient of d then we take the inverse image j of t in d and the inflation of to j the type j in d does not satisfy intertwinining the quotient ud u 1 d of the unit group by its first congruence subgroup is cyclic of order 8 choose a generator let be the image of a uniformizer of d in d u 1 d the group morphism d u 1 d u sending to i and to j is surjective proposition 4 16 let j g be an open subgroup containing z with j z compact then the g normalizer j of j is open in g and j z is compact as a consequence if j v is a cuspidal c type in g then the pair j indj j v is a cuspidal c type in g applying the procedure of 3 5 and 3 6 we immediately get representations of a reductive p adic group in characteristic distinct from p 19 theorem 4 17 let xa be a set of cuspidal ca types j v a in g satisfying unicity autc c a stability and autc c a unicity let ya denote the set of cuspidal ca types in g of the form j indj j v a where j v xa and j is the g normalizer of j and let y denote the set of cuspidal c types j v in g obtained by applying the decomposition theorem 2 1 to ya let za denote the set of isomorphism classes of indgj v a for j v a xa and let z denote the set of isomorphism classes of c representations of g obtained by applying the decomposition theorem 2 1 to za then i za is the set of isomorphism classes of indgj v a for j v a ya and z is the set of isomorphism classes of indgj v for j v y ii the set y satisfies unicity and intertwining iii if moreover xa satisfies aut ca stability and aut ca unicity then y satisfies aut c stability and aut c unicity the key to the proof of proposition 4 16 is the next lemma let gad be the adjoint group of g f g gad gad f the natural group homomorphism with kernel z and b b gad the bruhat tits building of gad let j g be an open subgroup containing z such that j z is compact the g normalizer j of j which contains j is open but f j gad might not be open when the characteristic of f is 2 the image of sl 2 f in pgl 2 f is not open because 1 is not open in f f 2 lemma 4 18 the subset bf j b of fixed points of f j is compact and non empty proof the subgroup f j gad being compact the set bf j is not empty because any orbit of f j in b is bounded hence contains a point fixed by its gad stabilizer 7 3 2 4 let b be the landvogt compactification of b the action of f j on b is continuous 39 14 31 so the subset b f j b of fixed points of f j is closed hence compact the open subgroup j g is not contained in any proper parabolic subgroup of g which is f analytic of dimension less than the dimension of g and j it follows that f j is not contained in any proper parabolic subgroup of gad this implies b f j bf j 39 14 4 i 12 4 12 3 2 4 and the notations 0 20 and 0 15 hence the lemma we finally prove proposition 4 16 it is clear that j contains z and is open as it contains j we prove that j is z compact the gad normalizer k of f j is a closed subgroup of gad stabilizing bf j and bf j is a compact non empty subset of b by the lemma a non empty compact subset of b is bounded in the metric space b 7 2 5 1 there exists x bf j fixed by k 7 3 2 4 by 7 3 3 1 the gad stabilizer of x is open and compact as it contains k we deduce that k is compact hence f 1 k is z compact as well as the closed subgroup j f 1 k 4 3 fields of the same characteristic for some groups g a good set of types as in theorem 4 17 has been produced only for c it is likely that all the arguments can be adapted to obtain such a set of types for all algebraically closed fields of characteristic 0 but that needs verification let c c be two fields of the same characteristic c and algebraic closure ca c a we write c 0 for the prime subfield of c and c a 0 for its algebraic closure in c a here we show directly using twists by unramified characters that a good set of ca types in g gives rise to a good set of c a types in g 20 guy henniart marie france vign ras the centre z of g acts on any irreducible smooth ca representation a of g by a ca character a called its central character because a is admissible proposition 4 10 theorem 4 19 let a be an irreducible cuspidal ca representation of g assume that the central character a of a has finite order then a is defined over a finite extension of c 0 in ca proof because a has finite order by assumption the subfield k ca generated by the values of a is a finite cyclotomic extension of c 0 choose an open compact subgroup j g such that a j 6 0 by corollary 3 5 it is enough to prove that the hca g j module a j is defined over a finite extension of c 0 we know that dimca a j n is finite by admissibility moreover by z compactness of cuspidal representations 55 ii 2 7 we know that the coefficients vanish outside a finite union of cosets jgzj and that there are only finitely many cosets jgzj which give non zero operators a jgzj endca a j z z those operators generate a finite dimensional k subalgebra of endca a j because a jgzj a z a jgj each such operator satisfies a non trivial polynomial equation with coefficients in k the finiteness up to k shows that the eigenvalues of the a jgj taken together generate a finite extension l k in ca the characteristic polynomials of the a jgj all have their coefficients in l choose a ca basis of a j the coefficients of the a jgj endca a j in the chosen basis generate a finitely generated l subalgebra a ca and we get an l algebra homomorphism hl g j m n a any quotient field e of a is a finite extension of l and we get an l algebra homomorphism hl g j m n e thus gives an he g j module structure on e n choose an extension e ca of the embedding l ca 4 4 no 3 corollaty 2 of theorem 2 that gives an hca g j module structure on ca e e n let us prove that the two hca g j modules c a e e n and a j are isomorphic which shows that a j is defined over e indeed for h hl g j the characteristic polynomial of h is the image in e t of the characteristic polynomial of h which is the characteristic polynomial of h acting on a j and has coefficients in l by 5 20 no 6 corollary 1 of theorem 2 the two hca g j modules c a n and a j have isomorphic semisimplifications but the second one is simple already so ca n and a j are isomorphic corollary 4 20 base change from ca 0 to c a yields a bijection between isomorphism classes of irreducible cuspidal ca 0 representations of g with central character of finite order and isomorphism classes of irreducible cuspidal ca representations of g with central character of finite order that bijection is clearly compatible with the action of finite order smooth characters which have values in ca 0 we will remove in corollary 4 26 iii the restriction in corollary 4 20 if c is another algebraically closed field of characteristic c then its prime field c 0 is isomorphic to c 0 and so are the algebraic closures c a 0 in c a and c 0 a in c a consequently any isomorphism ca 0 c 0 a will yield a bijection between isomorphism classes of irreducible cuspidal ca representations of g with central character of finite order and isomorphism classes of irreducible cuspidal c a representations of g with central character of finite order a character of g is said to be unramified if it is trivial on the subgroup g 0 generated by the compact subgroups of g we will remove the restriction that the central character has finite order by twisting by unramified ca characters of g representations of a reductive p adic group in characteristic distinct from p 21 we choose a subgroup z of z isomorphic to znz such that z is the product of z and of its maximal compact subgroup z 0 proposition 4 21 let z ca be a smooth character then there is an unramified character g ca such z is trivial on z so has finite order proof since z z 0 g g 0 has finite index z can be extended to a c a character of g trivial on g 0 calling the inverse of that character z z c a is trivial on z and coincides with on z 0 so has finite order as z z 0 z is finite corollary 4 22 let be an irreducible smooth ca representation of g there is an unram ified ca character of g such that the central character of has finite order remark 4 23 if already has a central character of finite order and is an unramified character such that the central character of has finite order then z has finite order and so has because z z 0 has finite index in g g 0 so in the corollary the character is well defined up to finite order unramified characters note that twisting by unramified characters preserves irreducibility intertwining and cus pidality stability under twisting by unramified characters is easy to verify in all the known explicit constructions of types proposition 4 24 any irreducible smooth ca representation a of g is defined over a finite extension of c proof a there exists an unramified ca character a of g such that the central character of a a has finite order corollary 4 22 if a a is defined over a finite extension of c then a has the same property as the values of a generate a finite extension of c as g g 0 is finitely generated b there is a parabolic subgroup p mn of g and an irreducible cuspidalc representation a of m such that a is a subquotient of indgp a we show that any irreducible subquotient of indgp a is defined over a finite extension of c b 1 if p m g a is cuspidal this is clear by a and theorem 4 19 b 2 in general a descends to a finite extension of c by b 1 applying the decomposition theorem 2 1 there exists a finite extension c c in ca and an absolutely irreducible c representation of m such that a ca c proposition 4 10 v if c c is an extension in ca the length c of indgp c c is finite bounded proposition 4 12 and 31 corollary i 2 we have c 1 c 2 for any finite extensions c 1 c 2 of c in ca as an increasing bounded sequence of integers stabilize there exists a finite extension c 1 c such that c 1 c 2 for all finite extensions c 2 c 1 in c a the irreducible subquotients of indgp c 1 c are admissible and remain irreducible by any finite scalar extension by lemma 2 2 ii we deduce that any irreducible subquotient of indgp a is defined over c 1 we can now remove the conditions dimc endc g and a absolutely irreducible and defined over a finite extension of c in 31 theorem iii 4 as c 6 p we get corollary 4 25 the map sending to the set of irreducible subquotients of ca c induces a bijection from the set of isomorphism classes of irreducible smooth c representations of g to the set of orbits under autc c a of isomorphism classes of irreducible smooth ca representations a of g 22 guy henniart marie france vign ras let us now apply those considerations to cuspidal types let za denote the set of isomor phism classes of cuspidal irreducible ca representations of g with central character of finite order similarly za 0 for the field c a 0 corollary 4 26 i the base change from ca 0 to c a yields a bijection from xa 0 x a 0 is a set of cuspidal c a 0 types in g satisfying z a 0 exhaustion onto xa xa is a set of cuspidal ca types in g satisfying za exhaustion ii let xa 0 as in i and x a its base change then xa satisfies unicity if and only if xa 0 does xa is aut ca stable if and only if xa 0 is aut c a 0 stable xa satisfies aut ca unicity if and only if xa 0 satisfies aut c a 0 unicity xa is stable under twisting by unramified characters of g with finite order if and only if xa 0 does iii if xa as in i satisfies unicity and stability under unramified characters with finite order of g then the set ya of cuspidal ca types in g obtained from xa by twisting by all unramified characters of g satisfies exhaustion for the isomorphism classes of all cuspidal irrca g and unicity it satisfies aut c a stability resp aut ca unicity if and only if xa does proof i base change from ca 0 to c a of a set xa 0 of cuspidal c a 0 types in g satisfying z a 0 exhaustion yields a set xa of cuspidal ca types in g that satisfies za exhaustion because of the theorem that works also in the reverse direction let xa be a set of cuspidal ca types in g satisfying za exhaustion and j v xa because indgj v has central character of finite order so has v and as remarked above v is the base change to ca of a ca 0 representation v a 0 of j then indgj v is the base change to c a of indgj v a 0 and consequently j v a 0 is a cuspidal ca 0 type in g note that j v a 0 is uniquely determined by j v if we let x a 0 be the set of types obtained from xa in that manner then xa 0 satisfies z a 0 exhaustion if we base change again to ca we get back the set xa of ca types ii because base changing types from ca 0 to c a is compatible with g conjugation xa satisfies unicity if and only if xa 0 does note also that za is aut ca stable and za 0 is aut c a 0 stable all isomorphism classes of ca representations obtained by base change from ca 0 are obviously autca 0 c a invariant so that autca 0 c a acts trivially on za and xa and the action of aut ca on za and xa factorizes through the quotient aut ca 0 the other properties of ii are clear iii is clear 4 4 level 0 cuspidal types in this subsection to conform to current usage in the relevant literature we write now the types j instead of j v it is natural to conjecture that all irreducible cuspidal c representations of g are compactly induced from a cuspidal c type j because all explicit examples have that form of course when g has semisimple rank 0 5 then g z is compact and all irreducible smooth c representations are cuspidal of finite dimension so the conjecture is trivially true with j g even so it is interesting to have inducing types j where j 6 g the example of the multiplicative group of a finite dimensional central division algebra over f is examined in 60 6 5 the rank of g is the f rank of g representations of a reductive p adic group in characteristic distinct from p 23 when g has semisimple rank 1 m weissman recently proved the conjecture using that the building b of gad is a tree if is an irreducible cuspidal c representation of g there is a c type j of g such that indgj where j is either the g stabilizer of a vertex or of of an edge of b see 58 corollary 2 6 when c c and the note following it for general c the other known cases assume c algebraically closed initially c c and also make assumptions on g or on the representations considered but those cases include more precise information in the guise of an explicit list of c types inducing to those representations very often that list satisfies exhaustion for the kind of representations considered and unicity we will verify stability by the group of automorphisms of c and apply theorem 4 17 to extend the result to a general coefficient field c no longer assumed algebraically closed the case of level 0 representations requires no assumption on g and does not assume c algebraically closed for any point x in the bruhat tits building b of the adjoint group gad we denote by gx the g stabilizer of x gx 0 the parahoric subgroup fixing x and gx 0 the pro p unipotent radical of gx 0 the g normalizer of gx 0 is gx if x is a vertex 59 lemma 3 3 i and gx 0 gx 0 is the group of points of a connected reductive group over the residue field kf when x is a vertex it is known that gx determines x the proof uses that two vertices x 6 y are contained in the same apartment there is an affine root containing x and not y implying that the corresponding unipotent subgroup of g does not have the same intersection with gx and with gy this implies that gx is its own g normalizer as ggxg 1 ggx for g g a c representation of g has level 0 if x gx 0 where x runs through the vertices in b in particular it is smooth for irreducible this means that gx 0 6 0 for some vertex x b the category of level 0 c representations of g is a direct factor of modc g and the parabolic induction respects level 0 let z 0 denote the set of isomorphism classes of level 0 irreducible cuspidal c representations of g clearly z 0 is stable under aut c lemma 4 27 let x y b be two different vertices and irrc gx if gx 0 acts trivially on and is cuspidal as a representation of gx 0 gx 0 then gx gy 0 has no non zero fixed vector in proof by 56 lemma 5 2 the image of gx 0 gy in gx 0 gx 0 is a parabolic subgroup with unipotent radical the image of gx 0 gy 0 because x and y are two disctinct vertices that parabolic is not gx 0 gx 0 and the result comes from the cuspidal assumption proposition 4 28 if gx 0 acts trivially on irrc gx and is cuspidal as a represen tation of gx 0 gx 0 then the space of vectors fixed by gx 0 in ind g gx is made out of the functions with support in gx in particular it affords the representation of gx proof put j gx j 0 gx 0 j 1 gx 0 as in section 3 4 the restriction of ind g j to j 1 splits as a direct sum jgj 1 ind jgj 1 j over the double cosets jgj 1 of the subspaces ind jgj 1 j consisting of functions with support in jgj 1 the subspace of functions with support in j as a representation of j is isomorphic to and is trivial on j 1 it is enough to show that for g g j a function in indgj with support in jgj 1 and right invariant under j 1 is 0 putting x gy this follows from lemma 4 27 as y 6 x for g g gx and the isomorphisms 3 3 and 3 4 proposition 6 5 will be a generalization of this proposition 24 guy henniart marie france vign ras corollary 4 29 if gx 0 acts trivially on irrc gx and is cuspidal as a representation of gx 0 gx 0 then ind g gx is irreducible and endc g ind g gx endc gx proof as before put j gx j 0 gx 0 j 1 gx 0 a quotient of ind g j contains a representation of j isomorphic to by frobenius reciprocity for compact induction indgj and a subrepresentation of indgj as a representation of j has a quotient isomorphic to by frobenius reciprocity for smooth induction indgj and the inclusion of ind g j in ind g j but the restriction of indgj to the pro p group j 1 is semi simple and by the proposition indgj as a representation of j contains as a subquotient only once hence ind g j is irreducible similarly one infers that endc g ind g j endc j indeed as in section 3 4 this means that homc j g 1 jg g 0 for all double cosets jgj 6 j putting x gy we have g 1 jg gy with x 6 y when jgj 6 j in this case gy gx 0 has no non zero fixed vector in g by lemma 4 27 but any vector in is fixed by gy gx 0 when c is algebraically closed the irreducibility of indggx is proved in 56 with another proof the result for c c goes back to 42 and 43 corollary 4 30 assume that indggx ind g gy for a vertex y b and irrc gy and that and as representations of gx 0 and gy 0 are the inflations of cuspidal representations of gx 0 gx 0 and gy 0 gy 0 respectively then y gx and g for some g g proof if y gx for some g g we may conjugate gy to reduce to y x in which case the proposition implies if y is not of the form gx then by the reasoning of the proposition gy 0 gx fixes no non zero vector in which yields a contradiction this argument rose out of conversations with r deseine definition 4 31 a level 0 cuspidal c type in g is a pair j where j gx for some vertex x of b and is the isomorphism class of an irreducible c representation of j trivial on gx 0 and cuspidal as a representation of gx 0 gx 0 if moreover is supercuspidal as a representation of gx 0 gx 0 then we say that j is supercuspidal by corollary 4 29 a level 0 cuspidal c type j in g is a cuspidal c type definition 4 14 since indgj is irreducible lemma 4 32 let x be a vertex of b irrc gx and irrc g let c c be a field extension irrc gx a subquotient of c c and irrc g a subquotient of c c i has level 0 if and only if has level 0 ii gx is a level 0 cuspidal resp supercuspidal c type in g if and only if gx is a level 0 cuspidal resp supercuspidal ca type in g proof i gx 0 6 0 if and only if gx 0 6 0 31 iii 1 ii as c representations is a direct sum of representations isomorphic to because c c is so is trivial on gx 0 if and only if does in 4 1 which is valid for finite reductive groups we saw that is cuspidal if and only if is cuspidal similarly for supercuspidal proposition 4 11 we deduce that is the inflation of a cuspidal resp supercuspidal representation of gx 0 gx 0 if and only if does theorem 4 33 the set x 0 of level 0 cuspidal c types in g satisfies intertwining unicity z 0 exhaustion and aut c stability representations of a reductive p adic group in characteristic distinct from p 25 proof the set x 0 satisfies intertwining by corollary 4 29 and unicity by corollary 4 30 it is aut c stable as cuspidality is preserved under the action of aut c on c representations of a finite reductive group when c is algebraically closed z 0 exhaustion and unicity is in 42 and 43 when c c and the arguments of 43 carry over to c exhaustivity was implicit in 56 and is established by fintzen at the end of 26 the hypothesis on g of 26 plays no r le for level 0 representations when c is not algebraically closed z 0 exhaustion follows from z 0 exhaustion over ca by theorem 4 17 noting that the group j gx is its own g normalizer corollary 4 34 any irreducible cuspidal c representation of g of level 0 is compactly induced from a level 0 cuspidal c type j in g unique modulo g conjugation it satisfies intertwining endc g endc j 5 supercuspidality in level 0 let j be a level 0 cuspidal c type of g inducing a level 0 cuspidal irreducible repre sentation indgj of g our goal is to prove theorem 5 1 j is supercuspidal if and only if is supercuspidal the equivalence will be a consequence of theorems 5 10 for only if and 5 11 for if below in 5 3 we use injective hulls as our main tool 5 1 injectives in the category of representations with a fixed action of the center only in this subsection c is a field of any characteristic we fix a closed subgroup z of the center z the abelian group z is almost finitely generated definition 3 1 let be an irreducible smooth c representation of z the dimension of is finite proposition 3 6 applied to v g z z the dimension of is 1 if and only if is absolutely irreducible if and only if endc z c remark 5 2 the c algebra c z acts on via a quotient field c which is a finite extension of c and endc z c as z is abelian for modc g the isotypic part of is the sum of the subrepresentations of z isomorphic to because z is central in g is a subrepresentation of the representation is called isotypic if any irreducible c representation of g is isotypic for some irrc z let modc g denote the category of isotypic representations in modc g and irrc g irrc g modr g for a parabolic subgroup p mn of g the parabolic induction indgp and its adjoints give functors between modc g and modc m lemma 5 3 modc g and modc g are grothendieck abelian categories proof the proof for modc g 57 lemma 3 2 extends to modc g recall that a grothendieck category admits sufficiently many injectives any object embeds in an injective object and that every object has an injective hull an essential extension which is injective 38 3 d notation 5 4 for modc g we denote by i an injective hull of in modc g and by i an injective hull in modc g 26 guy henniart marie france vign ras lemma 5 5 let modc g the isotypic part of an injective hull of in modc g is an injective hull of in modc g proof if modc g is injective its isotypic part is injective in modc g as homc g homc g for any modc g as a consequence i is isomorphic to a direct summand of the isotypic part of i a supplement i has a trivial intersection with as i is an essential extension of containing i we have i 0 hence the result 5 2 supercuspidality and injective hulls let us revert to our running hypothesis that c has characteristic different from p supercuspidality can be seen on the injective hull this was proved by hiss for finite reductive groups 32 proposition 2 3 lemma 5 6 when g is a finite reductive group in characteristic p an irreducible c representation of g is supercuspidal if and only if an injective hull i of modc g is cuspidal hiss formulates this result in terms of projective cover but in that case i is a projective cover we imitate the proof of hiss to show proposition 5 7 let irrc g then is supercuspidal if and only if i is right cuspidal if the second adjunction holds for g c or if has level 0 then is supercuspidal if and only if i is cuspidal proof by definition 4 5 is supercuspidal if and only if is not a subquotient of indgp for all proper parabolic subgroups p mn of g and modc m we have 5 1 irrc g is a subquotient of modc g if and only if homc g i 6 0 indeed if f homc g i is non zero then f hence is a subquotient of conversely if is a subquotient ot then is a subrepresentation of a quotient of the inclusion of in i extends to a r g map i inflating to a r g map i by adjunction is supercuspidal if and only if rgp i 0 for all proper parabolic sub groups p of g which means by definition that i is right cuspidal right cuspidality passes to subrepresentations because rgp is left exact so i right cuspidal implies i right cuspidal conversely i right cuspidal implies is supercuspidal when the second adjunction holds for g c or has level 0 because in this case is supercuspidal if and only if is not a subquotient of indgp for all proper parabolic subgroups p mn of g and irrc m remark 4 8 as irrc m is isotypic for some irrc z b the representation indgp is also isotypic if is a subquotient of ind g p with irrc m then and homc g ind g p i homc g ind g p i by adjunction we deduce that is supercuspidal if and only if i is right cuspidal our assumption implies that i right cuspidal is equivalent to i cuspidal remark 4 4 recalling that level zero representations form a direct factor in modc g recall that a functor between abelian categories having an exact left adjoint respects in jectives similarly a functor having an exact right adjoint respects projectives 33 ii 10 example 5 8 a indgp and r g p respect injectives the left adjoint functors n and ind g p are exact and n respects projectives its right adjoint ind g p is exact b let c c a field homomorphism the scalar extension c c modc g modc g respects projectives and the restriction right adjoint of the extension respects injectives they are both exact representations of a reductive p adic group in characteristic distinct from p 27 c let j be an open subgroup of g containing z and irrc z b the restriction resgj modc g modc j has a right adjoint the smooth induction ind g j and a left adjoint the compact induction indgj 55 i 5 7 to see that ind g j and ind g j preserve isotypic representations use remark 5 2 the three functors are exact 55 i 5 9 i 5 10 the restriction resgj respects injectives and projectives the compact induction ind g j respects projectives and the smooth induction indgj respects injectives let j 1 be a normal subgroup of j such that inflates a representation 0 of z z j 1 the j 1 invariant functor modc j modc j j 1 0 is right adjoint to the inflation the inflation is exact preserves injectives and identifies modc j j 1 0 to the category modc j j 1 of representations in modc j trivial on j 1 if moreover the pro order of j 1 is invertible in c the j 1 invariant functor is exact and modc j j 1 is a direct factor of modc j so the inflation and the j 1 invariant preserve injectives and projectives and the inflation preserves injective hulls 5 3 supercuspidality and types in the remaining of section 5 we assume that z z let j be a level 0 cuspidal c type of g where is isotypic for irrc z i an injective hull of in modc j and j 0 and j 1 as in the proof of proposition 4 28 put indgj since j 1 is a pro p normal subgroup of j i is trivial on j 1 and indgj i is injective in modc g example 5 8 c since ind g j i contains the injective hull i of in modc g is a direct factor of ind g j i the compact induction ind g j induces an injec tive inclusion preserving map from the lattice of subrepresentations of i to the lattice of subrepresentations of indgj i proposition 5 9 i is finite dimensional projective indecomposable with socle and cosocle isomorphic to j is supercuspidal if and only if i is cuspidal as a representation of j 0 j 1 the proof will be given in 5 4 let us assume the proposition and prove theorem 5 10 assume j supercuspidal then indgj is supercuspidal moreover indgj i is an injective hull i of in modc g it is cuspidal projective indecomposable with socle and cosocle isomorphic to the lattices of subrepresentations of i and of i are isomorphic by the map w 7 ind g j w which is equal to ind g j w with inverse v 7 v j 1 proof by proposition 5 9 i has finite length and is cuspidal as a representation of j 0 j 1 any irreducible subquotient of i is cuspidal as a representation of j 0 j 1 by proposition 4 28 indgj ind g j is cuspidal and ind g j j 1 by induction on the length this is also true for any subquotient of i this gives the last assertion of the theorem and that indgj i has finite length is cuspidal and is projective since ind g j preserves projectives and indgj i ind g j i as the socle and the cosocle of i are both isomorphic to the socle and the cosocle of indgj i are both isomorphic to as i is indecomposable ind g j i is indecomposable and is an injective hull i of in modc g since i is cuspidal is supercuspidal proposition 5 7 in the reverse direction theorem 5 11 assume indgj supercuspidal then j is supercuspidal and i j 1 is an injective hull i of in modc j 28 guy henniart marie france vign ras proof since has level 0 and is supercuspidal i is cuspidal and has level 0 proposition 5 7 and its proof let be an irreducible subquotient of i then is cuspidal of level 0 and induced from a level 0 cuspidal type gy corollary 4 34 if gy is not conjugate to j in g then j 1 0 proof of corollary 4 30 if gy is conjugate to j we may take gy j and then j 1 proposition 4 28 we deduce that ij 1 is cuspidal as a representation of j 0 j 1 by the following lemma lemma 5 12 let modc g if j 1 is cuspidal or 0 as a representation of j 0 j 1 for each irreducible subquotient of then the same is true for proof let p mn a proper parabolic subgroup of j 0 j 1 assume that there exists f j 1 such that the average fn of f along n is not 0 let be an irreducible quotient of the subrepresentation of generated by fn the image of fn in is not 0 and is fixed by j 1 hence j 1 is not 0 and is not cuspidal as a representation of j 0 j 1 a contradiction proving the lemma as ij 1 modc j is injective example 5 8 c and contains j 1 proposition 4 28 i is a direct factor of i j 1 as i j 1 is cuspidal as a representation of j 0 j 1 the same is true for i hence j is supercuspidal proposition 5 7 by theorem 5 10 ind g j i is an injective hull of in modc g and ind g j i i 1 i that proves the theorem 5 4 proof of proposition 5 9 with the notations of 5 3 we put h j j 1 as z j 1 is trivial z identifies with a subgroup y of h with irrc y inflates modc h and i inflates an injective hull i of in modc h in general let h be a group with a central subgroup y of finite index irrc y irrc h and i an injective hull of in modc h by adjunction indhy is a generator of the abelian category modc h or equivalently the functor hom indhy is faithful in modc h 34 proposition 5 2 4 as y has finite index in h indhy is projective in modc h by morita theory the category modc h is equivalent to the category of right modules over the c algebra endc h ind h y the algebra c y acts on via a quotient field c which is a finite extension of c and endc y c remark 5 2 the convolution c algebra h of functions f h c such that f yh y f h for y y h h is isomorphic to endc h ind h y recall 38 16 54 that a finite dimensional c algebra a is called symmetric if there exists a linear map on a satisfying ab ba for a b a and ker does not contain a non zero right ideal of a lemma 5 13 h is a symmetric c algebra proof we choose a c linear map c c with 1 6 0 and we consider the linear map f 7 f f 1 on h we have f f f f for f f h because f f 1 f f 1 for g g and d c d 6 0 let eg d h with support gz such that eg d g d for any non zero f h there exists g g and d d d 6 0 such that f eg d 1 1 this shows that ker does not contain a non zero right ideal of h proposition 5 14 i is finite dimensional projective indecomposable with as its socle and cosocle representations of a reductive p adic group in characteristic distinct from p 29 proof as h is a symmetric c algebra any simple h module has a finite dimensional pro jective cover which is also an injective hull 38 corollary 16 64 it is consequently indecom posable with as its socle and cosocle the proposition follows by morita equivalence we consider now only the example h y i given in the beginning of this subsection 5 4 then the first assertion of the proposition 5 9 follows from proposition 5 14 put h 0 j 0 j 1 with the notations of 5 3 then h 0 is a finite normal subgroup of h such that y h 0 is trivial let be an irreducible quotient of h 0 and i an injective hull of in modc h 0 proposition 5 15 the restriction of i to h 0 is a sum of h conjugates of i proof a we restrict first to h 0 y let irrc h 0 y be a quotient of h 0 y and i an injective hull of in modc h 0 y by proposition 5 14 i is indecomposable projective with as its socle and cosocle by mackey formula the restriction of indhh 0 y i to h 0 is a finite direct sum of h conjugates of i the representation ind h h 0 y i is injective in modc h and contains ind h h 0 y by adjunction indhh 0 y hence i is a direct factor of indhh 0 y i therefore the restriction of i to h 0 y is a direct sum of h conjugates of i we consider now the restriction of i to h 0 the functor v 0 7 v 0 c modc h 0 modc h 0 y is an equivalence of categories which ish equivariant write 0 c with 0 irrc h 0 and i 0 for an injective envelope of 0 in modc h 0 then i i 0 c so i h 0 is isomorphic to i 0 seen as a c representation by krull remak schmidt s theorem b we assume as we may that is a quotient of h 0 and we show that seen as a c representation i 0 is a direct sum of copies of i seen as a c representation 0 is equal to by our assumption extending scalars from c to c preserves projectives example 5 8 b as i is projective in modc h 0 so is c c i in modc h 0 but i 0 is a projective cover of 0 in modc h 0 so i 0 is a direct factor of c c i as a c representation c c i is a direct sum of copies of i so is i 0 by krull remak schmidt s theorem from that proposition i is cuspidal if and only if i h 0 is cuspidal or equivalently i is cuspidal as a representation of j 0 j 1 the second assertion of proposition 5 9 follows as is supercuspidal if and only if i is cuspidal 6 positive level cuspidal types we use the notations of section 4 6 1 positive level an irreducible smooth c representation of g or a cuspidal c type in g definition 4 14 which is not of level 0 definition 4 31 is said to be of positive level the known cases of cuspidal c types require special assumptions on g but give types for all positive level irreducible cuspidal c representations pioneer investigations were done in the 1970 s by g rardin and howe but the main results originate either from bushnell kutzko s approach 11 or from j k yu s construction 59 in both approaches positive level cuspidal c types j are constructed when c is alge braically closed via an explicit but intricate procedure actually there is a general procedure 30 guy henniart marie france vign ras based on facts established in each case we now explain that procedure for application to aut c stability and also to supercuspidality in 6 2 we shall give the references in each case below in 6 3 and 6 4 we assume that c is algebraically closed only at the very end do we generalize to non algebraically closed field the group j possesses a filtration by normal open subgroups j j 0 j 1 h 1 where j 0 j 1 is the group of points of a connected reductive group over the residue field kf of f j 1 is a pro p group and j 1 h 1 is a finite fp vector space the starting datum for the representation irrc j is a very special smooth c character of h 1 satisfying i the g normalizer of is j ii the g intertwining of is jg j where g g is the group of f points of a connected reductive group defined over a finite extension f of f and there is a vertex y in the bruhat tits building b g ad of the adjoint groupg ad ofg such thatg j g y g j 0 g y 0 g j 1 g y 0 in particular the inclusion g g induces isomorphisms j j 1 g y g y 0 and j 0 j 1 g y 0 g y 0 iii there is a unique representation irrc j 1 restricting on h 1 to a multiple of iv the g intertwining of is the g intertwining of and for any g g intertwining the c dimension of the space i g of g intertwiners of is 1 v there are preferred extensions of to irreducible c representations of j 0 preferred means that the g intertwining of the restriction of to a pro p sylow subgroup of j 0 contains the g intertwining of vi is any irreducible c representation of j of restriction to j 0 of the form c where is a preferred extension of to j 0 and is a c representation of j 0 trivial on j 1 inflated from a cuspidal c representation 0 of the finite reductive group j 0 j 1 remark 6 1 sometimes one knows that intertwining implies conjugacy in the sense that two very special characters appearing in the same irreducible cuspidal c representation of g are in fact g conjugate note that if intertwining implies conjugacy and is induced from a cuspidal type j which contains a very special character then if contains the very special character the characters and are g conjugate so we may assume j j and is induced from j which is a cuspidal type as described in i to vi sometimes one knows a weaker condition vii if an irreducible cuspidal c representation of g contains a very special character then it is induced from a cuspidal type j as described in i to vi the level 0 case definition 4 31 enters that framework if we decide that h 1 j 1 gx 0 and that is the trivial character of gx 0 so that j gx is the g normalizer of the trivial character of j 0 gx 0 is a preferred extension extending to j with these definitions a level 0 cuspidal c type j of g satisfies the properties i to vii for later use it is worth elaborating on conditions v and vi what means intertwining was recalled in 3 4 before remark 3 12 there are usually several preferred extensions of to j 0 if is one and j 0 c a character trivial on j 1 of order prime to p then is also a preferred extension because is trivial on the pro p sylow subgroups of j 0 there is a converse representations of a reductive p adic group in characteristic distinct from p 31 lemma 6 2 if is a preferred extension of to j 0 the other preferred extensions of to j 0 are where j 0 c is a character trivial on j 1 and of order prime to p proof an arbitrary extension of irrc j 1 to j 0 has the form where j 0 c a character trivial on j 1 which we can identify with a character of the finite reductive group g y 0 g 0 y for y in ii if the order of is divisible by p is not trivial on the pro p sylow subgroups of j 0 and we show that condition ii implies that is not a preferred extension of indeed the vertex y of b g ad lies in the apartment associated to a maximal split subtorus t g in b g ad let b g be a minimal parabolic subgroup containing t with unipotent radical u then u g y 0 u g y 0 is a pro p sylow subgroup of g y 0 g y 0 s u g y 0 g y 0 is a pro p sylow subgroup of g y 0 and sj 1 is a pro p sylow subgroup of j 0 by condition ii j 1 g g y 0 so sj 1 g s there exists t t such that t 1 u g y 0 t g y 0 by condition ii t intertwines these properties imply that for any preferred extension 1 of each t intertwiner of is also a t intertwiner of the restriction of 1 to s indeed is a t intertwiner of the restriction of 1 to the pro p sylow subgroup sj 1 of j 0 since sj 1 g s is also a t intertwiner of the restriction of 1 to s so 1 t 1 xt 1 x for all x t st 1 s in particular for x u g y 0 t st 1 s if is a preferred extension as is trivial on t 1 u g y 0 t j 1 we deduce t 1 xt x x for all x u g y 0 as is a preferred extension we have also t 1 xt x hence x for all x u g y 0 if the order of is divisible by p then is not trivial on u g y 0 we get 0 a contradiction because t interwines which shows that cannot be a preferred extension remark 6 3 most of the time all characters of g y 0 g y 0 have order prime to p see the list in digne michel 21 but there are some exceptions for example a non trivial complex character of sl 2 f 2 has order 2 the signature after identifying sl 2 f 2 with the group of permutations on 3 elements and the two non trivial complex characters of sl 2 f 3 have order 3 remark 6 4 applying clifford theory to j and its normal subgroup j 0 the restriction of to j 0 is semi simple by the condition vi its irreducible components are the j conjugates of c where irrc j 0 is trivial on j 1 and choosing one is obtained from the c isotypic component of j 0 by induction to j from the j stabilizer j of the isomorphism class of c let j j the j conjugate j of is again a preferred extension of because j normalizes j 0 hence permutes its pro p sylow subgroups and j normalizes and by the conditions ii and iv by lemma 6 2 j where j 0 c is a character trivial on j 1 of order prime to p the j conjugate of c is j c j j c and j is as an irreducible representation of j 0 trivial on j 1 and cuspidal as a representation of j 0 j 1 we conclude that vi is independent of the choice of the preferred extension that all irreducible components of j 0 have the form prescribed in vi with the same the condition on j 0 in vi is equivalent to j 0 c where is a preferred extension of to j 0 and is a c representation of j 0 inflated from a cuspidal c representation 0 of j 0 j 1 32 guy henniart marie france vign ras very often the construction of preferred extensions gives one which is normalized by j often too there is an extension of to j and then c where is an irreducible representation of j trivial on j 1 containing on restriction to j 0 as in the level 0 case we generalise now proposition 4 28 for level 0 cuspidal c types to level 0 cuspidal c types as above proposition 6 5 in the setting described with the conditions i to vi the space of vectors in indgj transforming by under right translation by h 1 is made out of the functions with support in j in particular it affords the representation of j proof the restriction of indgj to h 1 splits as a direct sum jgh 1 ind jgh 1 j the subspace of functions with support in j as a representation of j is isomorphic to by vi the restriction of to h 1 is isotypic it is enough to show that for g g j a function in indgj with support in jgh 1 and transforming by under right translation by h 1 is 0 saying that there exists a non zero function in indgj with support in jgh 1 transforming by under h 1 is saying that g interwines with since h 1 is isotypic if g interwines with then g interwines so belongs to jg j by ii because j normalizes we can assume g g since g interwines with it intertwines j 0 with it also intertwines as g 1 jg h 1 is a pro p group and is a preferred extension by v reasoning as in 11 proposition 5 3 2 we see that g intertwines with the trivial representation of j 1 restricting to g j 0 g y 0 we get that g intertwines seen as a representation of g y 0 with the trivial representation 1 of g y 0 we are now in a level 0 situation so g g must satisfy homg y 0 g 1 g y 0 g 1 6 0 which means that the irreducible cuspidal representation of g y 0 has a non zero vector fixed by g y 0 g g 1 y 0 by lemma 4 27 g has to be in the g stabilizer g y of y hence in j corollary 6 6 the conditions i to vi imply that indgj is irreducible and endc g endc j proof apply the proposition as in corollary 4 29 proposition 6 7 the conditions i to v imply that indgj 0 c is cuspidal when is a preferred extension of to j 0 and is a c representation of j 0 trivial on j 1 inflated from a cuspidal c representation 0 of the finite reductive group j 0 j 1 proof put v c and v for the inflation of v of j 0 z as j 0 z is trivial the representation indg j 0 z v has finite length and its irreducible subquotients are of the form indgj where satisfies the condition vi and ind g j is irreducible corollary 6 6 and cus pidal a coefficient of is a coefficient of indgj with z compact support hence ind g j 0 z v is cuspidal to show the cuspidality of indgj 0 v we use the criterion remark 4 3 for any f ind g j 0 v and any arbitrary proper parabolic subgroup p mn of g there exists a compact open subgroup nf of n such that enf f 0 where enf is the projection on the nf invariants we have indgj 0 v ind g j 0 z v c c z and the linear map c z c sending z z to 1 induces a surjective c g map indg j 0 z v cc z indgj 0 v sending f to f z z zf as zf g z f g for g g by the criterium of cuspidality recalled above there exists a compact open subgroup nf of n such that enf f 0 as the intersection j 0 z n is trivial we have also enf f 0 representations of a reductive p adic group in characteristic distinct from p 33 corollary 6 8 the conditions i to v imply that indgj is cuspidal when satisfies the condition vi without the irreducibility proof by adjunction embeds in indjj 0 j 0 and by exactness ind g j embeds in ind g j 0 j 0 by proposition 6 7 indgj 0 j 0 is cuspidal a subrepresentation of a cuspidal representation is cuspidal hence indgj is cuspidal in that setting aut c stability can be established as follows let j be a cuspidal c type as above and let aut c to prove that j is also a cuspidal c type as above there are two issues a if is a very special character then is also very special if a is true certainly is an irreducible representation of j 1 restricting on h 1 to a multiple of and we need b if is a preferred extension to j 0 of then is a preferred extension to j 0 of clearly c c and is as an irreducible c representation of j 0 trivial on j 1 with restriction to j 0 inflated from a cuspidal c representation 0 of j 0 j 1 if a and b are true j is a cuspidal c type as desired assuming a let us prove b indeed extends and since preserves intertwining b comes from condition v our task in the examples of 6 3 and 6 4 below will be to verify property a note that underlying the construction of the very special characters is the choice of an additive character f c assumed to be trivial on pf but not on of applying aut c transforms to the character x 7 x for some o f actually if a is the characteristic of f then is in z p o f if a 0 and in f p o f if a p in fact as we shall see changing to for o f does not change the set of types constructed inducing cuspidal irreducible representations and property a holds 6 2 supercuspidality and types let j be a cuspidal c type ing as in 6 1 satisfying the properties i to vi put indgj we are in the situation where c is algebraically closed j 1 is isotypic for a representation irrc j 1 which is normalized by j and extends to a representation irrc j 0 moreover for any h j the conjugate of by h is isomorphic to h where h is a c character of j 0 trivial on j 1 of order prime to p we choose a preferred extension of remark 6 4 lemma 6 2 we have 6 1 j 0 c where is cuspidal as a representation of j 0 j 1 the definition of depends on the choice of the preferred extension of the other preferred extensions have the form where is a character of j 0 trivial on j 1 of order prime to p by the discussion in 6 1 before lemma 6 2 so that c 1 c therefore another choice of gives twisted by a character of order prime to p by clifford s theory j 0 is semi simple of finite length the irreducible components are j conjugate of the form where is an irreducible component of let i be the injective hull of in modc j 0 the following properties are equivalent i some irreducible component of is supercuspidal as a representation of j 0 j 1 ii i is cuspidal as a representation of j 0 j 1 lemma 5 6 definition 6 9 j is called supercuspidal if the properties i ii are satisfied 34 guy henniart marie france vign ras the definition does not depend on the choice of the preferred extension in of in level 0 where and are trivial it coincides with definition 4 31 and j is supercuspidal if and only if is supercuspidal theorem 5 1 in positive level our goal is to prove theorem 6 10 if j is supercuspidal then is supercuspidal the converse is true if g c satisfies the second adjunction and j satisfies the property vii of 6 1 the proof is parallel to the previous ones in level 0 if g c satisfies the second adjunction with one extra complication coming from and a slight simplification due to the fact that c being algebraically closed and are isotypic for some irrc z of dimension 1 which can be considered as a c character of z the category modc j 0 of c representations of j 0 which are isotypic on restriction to j 1 is a direct factor of modc j 0 when 1 j 1 is trivial modc j 0 1 j 1 is equivalent to modc j 0 j 1 we have similar results when j 0 is replaced by a subgroup of g containing j 1 as a normal subgroup since is an extension of to j 0 the functor 6 2 w 7 w c modc j 0 1 j 1 modc j 0 is an equivalence depending on the choice of a reverse equivalence being given by homc j 1 with the natural action of j 0 the functor v 7 v modc g modc j sending a representation to its isotypic part on restriction to j 1 with the natural action of j is exact and respects injectives and projectives and also the functor e modc j modc j 0 1 j 1 v 7 homj 1 v where is the c character of z such that is isotypic in level 0 where and are trivial v e v v j 1 we have proposition 6 5 and e formula 6 1 let i be an injective hull of in modc j proposition 6 11 i is finite dimensional projective indecomposable with socle and coso cle isomorphic to j is supercuspidal if and only if e i is cuspidal as a representation of j 0 j 1 that corresponds to proposition 5 9 in level 0 proof the kernel ker of the very special character of h 1 is a normal open pro p subgroup of j and is trivial on ker by the properties i and iii in 6 1 we put h j ker as z ker is trivial z identifies with a subgroup y of h with irrc y inflates modc h and i inflates an injective hull i of in modc h see the example 5 8 c the first assertion of the proposition follows from proposition 5 14 applied to h y i by the equivalence 6 2 c where e is an irreducible quotient of j 0 by proposition 5 15 applied to h 0 j 0 ker the restriction of i to j 0 is a sum of j conjugates of i c where i is an injective hull of in modc j 0 1 j 1 a j conjugate of i c is of the form i c for a j conjugate i of i and a character of j 0 trivial on j 1 remark 6 4 hence e i is a sum of i it is cuspidal as a representation of j 0 j 1 if and only if i if and only if j is supercuspidal definition 6 9 theorem 6 12 1 assume j supercuspidal then indgj is supercuspidal moreover indgj i is an injective hull i of in modc g it is cuspidal projective indecomposable with socle and cosocle isomorphic to the lattices of subrepresentations of representations of a reductive p adic group in characteristic distinct from p 35 i and of i are isomorphic by the map w 7 ind g j w which is equal to ind g j with inverse v 7 v 2 assume supercuspidal then j is supercuspidal if g c satisfies the second adjunction and j satisfies the property vii of 6 1 that is a stronger form of theorem 5 1 which corresponds to theorems 5 10 and 5 11 in level 0 proof the proof of second part of 1 is the same as in theorem 5 10 so i is cuspidal of finite length hence is admissible and consequently right cuspidal proposition 4 10 when the second adjunction holds true the proposition 5 7 implies that is supercuspidal the proof of 2 which assumes the second adjunction follows the same method as for theorem 5 11 replacing corollary 4 34 by the property vii we show now that j supercuspidal implies supercuspidal without assuming the sec ond adjunction we recall the injective hull i j 0 of j 0 in modc j 0 and we consider the representation v indjj 0 i j 0 of j the restriction of v to j 0 is c where is a finite sum of i where is a character of j 0 trivial on j 1 and i a j conjugate of i remark 6 4 the representation indgj v ind g j 0 i j 0 of g is projective with quotient indgj as i j 0 is projective of quotient j 0 and is a quotient of v ind j j 0 j 0 by adjunction if j is supercuspidal then i is cuspidal as a representation of j 0 j 1 hence also and proposition 6 7 tells us that indgj v is cuspidal so is the quotient of the projective cuspidal representation indgj v hence is supercuspidal lemma 4 6 in the setting of 6 1 the field c is algebraically closed when c is not algebraically closed a cuspidal ca type j a of g defines by restriction to c a cuspidal c type j of g such that a seen as a c representation is isotypic definition 6 13 a cuspidal c type j of g arising by restriction to c of a cuspidal ca type j a of g in the setting of 6 1 with the properties i to vi satisfied is called supercuspidal if j a is supercuspidal definition 6 9 that definition ensures via theorem 5 1 and proposition 4 11 that indgj is super cuspidal if j is supercuspidal and that the converse is true if g c satisfies the second adjunction and j a satisfies also the property vii of 6 1 remark 6 14 the definition is compatible in level 0 with definition 4 5 which does not suppose c algebraically closed lemma 4 32 the definition does not depend on the choice of a because another irreducible component is a conjugate a of a by some autc c a we have a j 0 a a a c a a c a a is a preferred extension of a and an irreducible component of a is supercuspidal if and only if an irreducible component of a is 6 3 types la bushnell kutzko let us review the types constructed with the tech niques of bushnell kutzko the reader needs familiarity with the references as we only indicate why properties i to vii are true and how to establish aut c stability 6 3 1 gl n f we start with gl n f and c c treated in 11 the basic concepts are those of simple stratum and simple character the maximal simple characters in 11 are the very special characters here 36 guy henniart marie france vign ras we let v be an f vector space of dimension n e g v fn so that g autf v is isomorphic to gl n f a simple stratum a n r is made out of an hereditary of order a in endf v integers n r 0 and an element g normalizing a such that e f is a field and satisfying the conditions of 11 1 5 5 those conditions involve only the conjugation of on endf v and on a so it is straightforward that for a o f a n r a is again a simple stratum moreover the groups j j 0 j 1 h 1 attached to the two strata are the same 11 3 1 14 we write j 0 j 1 h 1 for bushnell kutzko s j a j 1 a h 1 a g b where b is the centralizer of in endf v the oe hereditary order b a b in b corresponds to a point in the bruhat tits building b g of g write y for the image of this point in b g ad we have 17 7 1 p 313 g y 0 b and g y is the normalizer of b in b we put j g yj 1 and we have j 0 gy 0 j 1 11 3 1 15 so that the inclusion b endf v induces an isomorphism g y g y 0 j j 1 as demanded by property ii to the simple stratum a n r is attached the set c a r of simple characters 11 3 2 1 and 3 2 3 we add the underlying character in the notation of 11 following the definitions one gets that c a r c a r a for a o f and that for aut c the map 7 yields a bijection c a r c a r c a r in particular property a of 6 1 is satisfied only r 0 is used in the sequel so we suppress it from the notation the simple characters occuring in the cuspidal representations are the maximal ones meaning that b is a maximal oe order in b 11 6 2 1 10 corollary 1 corresponding to the case where y is a vertex to b g ad if c a is a simple character its g normalizer is j 11 3 3 17 and its g intertwining is jg j 11 3 3 2 the non degenerate alternating bilinear form on j 1 h 1 is in 11 3 4 1 the existence and uniqueness of are in 11 5 1 1 and the g intertwining of is in 11 5 1 8 the conditions i ii iii iv of 6 1 are satisfied there are extensions of to j 0 11 5 2 1 a extension is an extension which is intertwined by g or equivalently by j 0 g j 0 or equivalently with the same g intertwining than because j 0 g j 0 jg j in particular it is a preferred extension and is normalized by j giving property v of 6 1 for a maximal simple character j j 0 is cyclic so a extension even extends to j in any case if is a extension and aut c then is also a extension the cuspidal types j of bushnell kutzko 11 6 2 are obtained by the procedure of 6 1 property v starting from a maximal simple character and a extension of in fact they are such that c where is an extension of to j and is a representation of j g yj 1 trivial on j 1 g y 0 with restriction of j 0 inflated from an irreducible cuspidal representation of j 0 j 1 g y 0 g y 0 the discussion in 6 1 shows that if one uses instead any preferred extension in lieu of we get the same set of cuspidal types following the procedure indicated after corollary 6 6 we deduce that the set of types thus obtained satisfies aut c stability exhaustion and unicity for the set of cuspidal types obtained by varying the maximal simple characters and including level 0 are given by 11 8 4 1 finally intertwining implies conjugacy is true for maximal simple characters 10 giving property vii the second adjointness holds for g c 17 6 3 2 gl m d the case of inner forms of gln of course it includes the split case but uses 11 as a basis is due to minguez s cherre and stevens 49 41 in their setting d is a central division algebra over f of finite reduced degree d v is a right d vector space representations of a reductive p adic group in characteristic distinct from p 37 of finite dimension m and g autd v is an inner form of gln f n md when m 1 g d has semisimple rank 0 cuspidal complex types were known before 60 6 minguez s cherre and stevens for a general algebraically closed field c of characteristic c 6 p construct a set of cuspidal simple c types using simple strata and simple characters for non level 0 types and they show exhaustion and unicity 41 theorem 3 11 let us now give detail enough to verify aut c stability and properties i to vii of 6 1 there is a notion 47 definition 2 3 of simple stratum a n r made out of an hered itary od order a in endd v where od is the ring of integers of d corresponding to a chain of od lattices in v we write indifferently a or in the notation of the simple stra tum to such a stratum is associated the centralizer b of in endd v and open subgroups j j 0 j 1 h 1 all normal in j see 47 formula 65 for j 0 j 1 h 1 whereas s cherre writes j for j 0 we write j for the group written k a b j 0 in 47 the normality property is proposition 3 43 there which also says that j 1 h 1 is a finite p group the chain is stable under e where e f and defines a point y in b g ad where g b we have j g yj 1 and j 0 g y 0 j 1 to get cuspidal types we have to restrict ot maximal simple strata 41 proposition 3 6 which means that y is a vertex as in 6 3 1 we restrict to r 0 and suppress it from the notation to a simple stratum n in g is attached a set c of simple characters h 1 c 47 definition 3 45 obtained by a restriction process from simple characters constructed in 11 following the definition it is straightforward that for a o f n a is again a simple stratum with the same attached groups and c a c a as in 6 3 1 we verify that aut c induces a bijection 7 c c c the g normalizer of c is j and its g intertwining is jg j j 1 g j 1 47 theorem 3 50 and rem 3 51 giving properties i and ii existence and uniqueness of come from 47 theorem 3 52 yielding property iii the intertwining property iv of is 48 proposition 2 10 an extension of to j 0 is a extension if it is normalized by b g 48 2 4 as the g centralizers of and coincide for any aut c we get stability for the extensions the extensions are preferred extensions in our sense property v as in 6 3 1 the other preferred extensions are obtained by twisting by a character of order prime to p and can equally be used to construct the cuspidal types if is a extension and as in property vi one can form j 0 c and consider the g normalizer j of j 0 c which is included in j as c is isotypic the extended maximal cuspidal simple types of 41 are the j where is any extension of c to j such extensions exist as j j 0 is cyclic as before for such a pair indg j is irreducible and it is for that set of pairs j including the level 0 ones that 41 theorem 3 11 gives exhaustion and unicity from proposition 3 18 we deduce that the set of pairs j where indj j also satisfies exhaustion and unicity and property vi is valid by clifford s theory that set of cuspidal types is verified to be aut c stable as in 6 3 1 starting from the analysis above of the action of aut c on simple characters and extensions finally we mention that property vii comes from 41 lemma 3 9 and 3 10 6 3 3 sln next we turn to sln treated in 13 for complex representations and extended recently to positive characteristic coefficients by cui 15 16 she also treats levi subgroups of sln to keep with her notation we let m be a levi subgroup of gln and add the exponent to indicate the intersection with g sln 38 guy henniart marie france vign ras to get cuspidal simple types for m one starts from such types for m as m is a product of glri one can take those obtained in 6 3 1 if j is a cuspidal simple type for m one defines 15 3 44 its projective normalizer j it contains j as a finite index subgroup the induced representation indj j is irreducible its restriction to j is semisimple let be any irreducible component of j and h nm its m normalizer in fact h is the m intertwining of and any irreducible representation of h containing on restriction to j induces irreducibly to a cuspidal irreducible representation indm h of m moreover each cuspidal irreducible representation of m has this form for some choice of j and a pair h obtained in this way is a cuspidal type in m and the set x of such types satisfies exhaustion and is stable under conjugation by m 15 theorem 3 5 1 unicity is obtained for c in 13 5 3 theorem and in general in 15 3 5 6 let us verify that x is aut c stable start with a cuspidal simple type j in m and choose and as above let aut c by 15 3 44 the projective normalizer j of j is the same for and clearly then is an irreducible component of j and nm nm furthermore is an irreducible representation of h nm containing on restriction to j this shows that h belongs to x as desired remark 6 15 that case of sln does not immediately conform to the common pattern de scribed before that question needs further study 6 3 4 classical groups the case of classical groups for any c but only when p is odd is due to kurinczuk and stevens 36 for c c 54 in this context f f 0 is an extension of degree 1 or 2 v is a finite dimensional f vector space 1 1 and h is a non degenerate hermitian form on v with respect to f 0 the group g g autf v h gv gw h v w for all v w v is the group of f 0 points of a unitary symplectic or orthogonal group g and u v h the f 0 points of the connected component g of g in the unitary and symplectic case u v h g in the orthogonal case f f 0 and 1 u v h is the special orthogonal group one needs semisimple strata n in endf v where this time is a sequence of of lattices in v 54 definition 2 4 again only r 0 is used and suppressed from the notation and the corresponding sets c of semisimple characters in autf v 54 3 1 now assume that 0 trf f 0 for some character 0 f 0 c and write x 7 x for the involution on endf v associated to h for the involution x 7 x 1 on autf v and is the lattice sequence in endf v dual to with respect to h then induces a bijection 7 c c clearly for aut c and c when the stratum n is self dual that is when is up to a translation in indices and the subgroups of autf v attached to that stratum by bushnell kutzko are invariant under and intersecting them with g gives subgroups h 1 h 1 a g j 1 j 1 a g j j 0 a g then j j 1 is the group of points of a possibly non connected reductive group over kf and we define j 0 of the subgroup of j such that j 0 j 1 is the connected component of j j 1 the set c of semisimple characters of g is obtained by restricting to h 1 the invariant semisimple characters of autf v corresponding to it is clear that the semisimple characters of g satisfy for a o f c a c a and aut c induces a bijection 7 c c c our very special characters are those semi simple representations of a reductive p adic group in characteristic distinct from p 39 characters satisfying some maximality condition and a procedure parallel to the previous ones gives a set of cuspidal c types in g 36 theorem a i let us verify properties i to vii first property ii is a special case of 36 theorem 3 10 and property i is an easy consequence property iii is 36 theorem 2 6 while iv is a special case of 36 theorem 4 1 in their 5 kurinczuk and stevens define extensions of for a semisimple character in c a extension in 36 is a representation of j j g and for property v we need to verify that its restriction to j 0 which 36 also calls a extension deserves to be called a preferred extension at least when the maximality condition is satisfied this comes from 54 4 1 indeed the very special characters that is the semisimple characters occurring in cuspidal representations are those attached to a skew semisimple stratum such that the associated order in b is maximal in that case theorem 4 1 in 54 defines extensions to j and their construction and corollary 3 11 in 54 show that they are exactly our preferred extensions note that 54 works over the complex numbers but the constructions of 3 and 4 are valid over our field c now the cuspidal types of 36 have the form where is a extension of to j and an irreducible representation of j with restriction to j 0 inflated from a cuspidal representation of j 0 j 1 and condition vi is satisfied property vii comes along the proof of exhaustion in 36 see the proof of theorem 11 2 see 37 for general results about intertwining implies conjugacy for semisimple characters adding as before the level 0 cuspidal c types one gets the set of cuspidal simple c types in g which satisfies exhaustion 36 theorema ii and unicity 37 main theorem using the action of aut c on semisimple characters analysed above verifying aut c stability for cuspidal simple types follows as before the second adjointness holds for g c 17 6 3 5 quaternionic form finally the case of a quaternionic form g of a classical group for odd p is obtained by skodlerak 50 for c c citesk 20 theorem 1 1 in the modular case that case is a mix of the previous two and skodlerak constucts a set of c types satisfying irreducibility exhaustion and unicity 51 theorem 1 1 the procedure to define semisimple characters is the same as for classical groups but starting with autd v where v is a right vector space of dimension m over a central quaternion division f algebra d equipped with an anti involution d 7 d it is necessarily of the first kind and a non degenerate hermitian form h on v with 1 1 the group g is the group of isometries of h it is connected reductive indeed over a quadratic unramified extension of f it gives a unitary group 50 proposition 2 2 starting with a semisimple stratum n endd v again r 0 is omitted one defines dual stratum n 50 definition 4 1 as in 6 3 4 and for a self dual stratum the set c of semisimple characters in g the intertwining of semisimple characters in g computed in 50 4 4 is the same in the modular case for the very special semisimple characters that is those giving rise to a cuspidal c type it has indeed the form jg j 50 proof of proposition 4 3 which gives property ii and i follows properties iii and iv come from 50 lemma 4 2 and proposition 4 3 we have already said why v is true and vi comes from 50 definition 6 2 vii from 50 theorem 8 1 the action of aut c follows the same pattern as 6 3 4 and adding the level 0 c types one gets the set of simple cuspidal c types in g which satisfies aut c stability 6 4 yu types we now turn to the representations constructed by yu wheng is a connected reductive group which splits over a tamely ramified field extension of f 59 we refer to the papers of fintzen 25 26 27 because she corrects an error in the proof of irreducibility 40 guy henniart marie france vign ras in 59 and also because she proves in 26 that when p does not divide the order of the absolute weyl group of g and for any algebraically closed field c with c 6 p the set of c types constructed by yu satisfies irreducibility and exhaustion hakim and murnaghan 30 theorem 6 3 go a long way towards proving unicity when c c but their result is not expressed in terms of a list of types the translation and the extension to c algebraically closed of characteristic c 6 p is done in the ph d thesis of r deseine 20 6 4 1 we follow the account and notation of 26 2 1 2 4 5 1 the input for the con struction comprises a sequence g g 1 g 2 gn 1 of twisted levi subgroups of g splitting over a tamely ramified extension of f and such that z gn 1 z g is anisotropic a sequence r 1 rn 0 of real numbers n 0 is

irreducible representation of gn 1 x trivial on gn 1 x 0 of restriction to the parahoric subgroup gn 1 x 0 gn 1 inflated from a cuspidal representation of the finite connected reductive group gn 1 x 0 gn 1 x 0 if n 0 a sequence of characters i of gi 1 assumed of depth ri with respect to x meaning trivial on gi 1 x ri and not trivial on gi 1 x ri and gi generic with respect to x in the sense of 59 9 p 59 a condition on i restricted to gi 1 x ri if gi 6 gi 1 remark 6 16 recall that the bruhat tits building b g of g is the direct product of the bruhat tits building b gad of the adjoint group gad by a real affine space for any point x b g we denote by x its projection in b gad and by gx and g x the g stabilizers of x and x the parahoric subgroup gx 0 of g fixing x and its pro p unipotent radical depend only on x and we put g x 0 gx 0 g x 0 gx 0 when n 0 we call g i 1 i n 1 ri 1 i n x i 1 i n 0 a yu datum the associated cuspidal c type of g is j 0 c where 6 6 3 j g 1 x r 1 2 gn x rn 2 gn 1 x g

by to describe the representation of k we introduce more notations following 26 2 5 for 1 i n there exists a unique c character i gn 1 x gi 1 x 0 gx ri 2 c given on gn 1 x gi 1 x 0 by the restriction of i and on gx ri 2 factorizing through a natural homomorphism from gx ri 2 gx ri to gi 1 x ri 2 gi 1 x ri on which it is induced by i that homomorphism is described in 27 2 5 after second bullet after 6 gi x ri ri 2 gi is the open compact subgroup denoted gi 1 gi f x ri ri 2 in 59 p 585 586 as that last notation underlies the group depends on both gi and gi 1 gn 1 x gn 1 is the gn 1 stabiliser of the image x of x in the building of g ad n 1 it normalizes gx ri ri 2 and gx ri ri 2 it is an open subgroup containing the center z gn 1 of gn 1 and gn 1 x z gn 1 is compact the second equality in 6 3 follows from gi x ri 2 gi x ri ri 2 gi 1 x ri 2 we have also gi x ri 2 gi x ri ri 2 gi 1 x ri 2 representations of a reductive p adic group in characteristic distinct from p 41 59 4 let denote the group of p roots of 1 in c by 59 proposition 11 4 vi gx ri ri 2 gx ri ri 2 admits the symplectic form x y 7 x y i i xyx 1 y 1 vi vi and a canonical special isomorphism j i gx ri ri 2 gx ri ri 2 ker i v i where v i is the finite heisenberg p group with underlying set vi and law given by v v v v 1 2 v v i we use an additive notation for both vi and the special isomorphism j i identifies the centres gx ri ri 2 gx ri ri 2 ker i and of the two groups the conjugation action of gn 1 x on gx ri ri 2 gx ri ri 2 preserves i so gives a group morphism gn 1 x sp vi i which is trivial on gn 1 x 0 and with j i gives a group morphism j i gn 1 x gx ri ri 2 gx ri ri 2 ker i sp vi i v i the heisenberg c representation i v i of v i with restriction to a multiple of the char acter given by the inclusion of into c extends canonically to an irreducible representation i of sp vi i v i the weil representation 28 theorem 2 4 hence a representation i j i of gn 1 x gx ri ri 2 gx ri ri 2 ker i on v i which inflates to an action of gn 1 x gx ri ri 2 on v i there is a unique representation of j on the tensor product ni 1 v i such that gn 1 x acts on v i as above for 1 i n and gi x ri ri 2 acts by i on v i and by multiplication by the character j gi x ri ri 2 on v j for 1 i 6 j n 7 6 4 2 to the above data we attach groups h 1 j 1 j 0 j and representations satisfy the properties i to vii of our setting of 6 1 as follows j is the group 6 3 replacing gn 1 x with gn 1 x 0 in j we get 6 4 j 0 g 1 x r 1 2 gn x rn 2 gn 1 x 0 g 1 x r 1 r 1 2 gn x rn rn 2 gn 1 x 0 replacing gn 1 x 0 with gn 1 x 0 in j 0 we get 6 5 j 1 g 1 x r 1 2 gn x rn 2 gn 1 x 0 g 1 x r 1 r 1 2 gn x rn rn 2 gn 1 x 0 the quotient j 0 j 1 gn 1 x 0 gn 1 x 0 is the finite connected reductive quotient of the parahoric subgroup gn 1 x 0 of gn 1 replacing r 1 2 rn 2 by r 1 2 rn 2 for i 1 n in j 1 we get 6 6 h 1 g 1 x r 1 2 gn x rn 2 gn 1 x 0 g 1 x r 1 r 1 2 gn x rn rn 2 gn 1 x 0 is the unique character of h 1 trivial on gn 1 x 0 and equal to i on gi x ri ri 2 for 1 i n is the unique representation of j 1 on ni 1 v i trivial on gn 1 x 0 where gi x ri ri 2 acts by i on v i and by multiplication by the character j gi x ri ri 2 on v j for 1 i 6 j n 7 the group gn 1 x gi 1 x 0 gx ri 2 contains gi x ri ri 2 for 1 i n 42 guy henniart marie france vign ras a preferred extension of is let us say why properties i to vii are true the intertwining of was determined by yu 59 theorem 9 4 giving i and ii properties iii and iv come from 59 theorem 11 5 and proposition 12 3 note that yu works over complex numbers but his reasoning for properties i to iv is valid here see 25 the fact that the construction above gives a preferred extension is essentially due to fintzen it is somewhat hidden in 25 proof of lemma 3 5 it would much more space to give detail so we omit them thus we have v and vi finally vii comes in the proof of exhaustion by fintzen 25 proof of theorem 7 1 once again giving detail would take us much more space dat proved the second adjointness holds for g c 17 19 deseine 20 proves unicity for the types constructed above 6 4 3 we verify now that the list of yu types is aut c stable let aut c we show that if g i 1 i n 1 x i 1 i n is a yu datum of associated type k then g i 1 i n 1 x i 1 i n is a yu datum of associated type k as in the other cases is trivial on gn 1 x 0 and restricts on gn 1 x 0 to a cuspidal representation of gn 1 x 0 gn 1 x 0 because does we explain now why i has depth ri and is gi generic if gi 6 gi 1 with respect to x because i does underlying the notion of genericity is the choice of an additive character f c as before giving an identification of the group g of smooth characters of g lie g with the dual g homf g f explicitly each element f g identifies with the smooth character f u f u of the additive group g for r r the orthogonal of gr is g x r and that of gx r is g x r our choice of yields an isomorphism gx r gx r g x r g x r changing to a for a o f multiplies by a 1 as f a a 1 f for r 0 gx r gx r identifies canonically with gx r gx r because g splits on a tamely ramified extension 24 rem 3 2 4 those considerations apply to gi 1 as well and changing to a for a o f does not change the depth of the smooth characters of gi 1 with respect to x or the gi genericity of the elements of gi 1 x ri gi 1 x ri by 59 9 p 59 that genericity is expressed in terms of the element of gx ri gx ri corresponding to it and multiplication by a o f does not affect it consequently if i is of depth ri and gi generic if gi 6 gi 1 with respect to x then so is i we proved that g i 1 i n 1 x i 1 i n is a yu datum it remains to show that k is the associated type we have and clearly we explain now why is the representation of k associated to i 1 i n it is clear that i i we have an isomorphism v i v i given by identity on vi and x 7 x on it extends to an isomorphism sp vi i v i sp vi i v i one checks from the construction 59 11 that the special isomor phisms satisfy j i j i and also j i j i the representation i v i of v i is the heisenberg representation of v i where acts by multiplication by i j 1 i and the associated weil representation of sp vi i v i is i composing with 1 we get an action of v i on v i c c v i which is the representations of a reductive p adic group in characteristic distinct from p 43 heisenberg representation given by i j 1 i on and the associated weil representation of sp vi i v i is i following the action of through the rest of the construction of is straightforward and we get that is the representation of k
