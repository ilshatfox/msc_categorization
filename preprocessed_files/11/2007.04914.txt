math lsu edu abstract whittaker functions of gl n r 11 12 are most known for its role in the fourier whittaker expansion of cusp forms 19 17 their behavior in the siegel set in large is well understood in this paper we insert into the literature some potentially useful properties of whit taker function over the group gl n r and the mirobolic group pn we proved the square integrabilty of the whittaker functions with re spect to certain measures extending a theorem of jacquet and shalika 13 for principal series representations we gave various asymptotic bounds of smooth whittaker functions over the whole group gl n r due to the lack of good terminology we use whittaker functions to refer to k finite or smooth vectors in the whittaker model 1 introduction let g gl n gl n r let u be the group of unipotent lower triangular matrices u be the group of unipotent upper triangular ma trices a be the group of positive diagonal matrices and m be the centralizer of a in g let k be the standard orthogonal group o n then we have the iwasawa decomposition g kau let h be a irreducible hilbert representation of g let be the frechet space of smooth vectors in h let be the topolog ical dual space of this dual space is equipped with the natural action of a functional is called a whittaker functional if u exp 2 i miui i 1 u u for some m rn 1 with mi 6 0 11 12 in 19 j shalika showed that whittaker functionals if exist are unique up to a con stant for if a whittaker functional exists the representation is often said to be generic in 15 kostant showed that a representation is generic if and only if it has the maximal gelfand kirillov dimension 15 we then know the classification of generic representations for 1 http arxiv org abs 2007 04914 v 1 gl n namely those irreducible representations induced from the dis crete series of gl 1 and gl 2 levi factors now fix an m we can define wh m f wh m f g f m if m 1 the constant vector with entries 1 we write whf g g f 1 obviously whf c c 1 u g now the group g will act from the right the space whf is known as the whittaker model of intro duced by jacquet in his studies of automorphic forms 12 because of the iwasawa decomposition whf g can be uniquely determined by its restriction on ak hence whittaker model is often regarded as a space of smooth functions on ak if f is a spherical vector then whf g is uniquely determined by whf a generally speaking whf m g is a smooth section of cm u g u g where cm denote the one dimensional representation defined by the character of u u exp 2 i n 1 i 1 ui i 1 mi let pn be the mirabolic subgroup consisting of invertible matrices with last row 0 0 0 1 pn is the semidirect product of gl n 1 and r n 1 when we refer to gl n 1 as a subgroup of gl n gl n 1 will always lie in the upper left corner consider the restriction whf pn it is a smooth section of c 1 u pn u pn which can be identified with a smooth section of c 1 un 1 gl n 1 un 1 gl n 1 and vice versa fix an invariant measure on gl n 1 and the eu clidean measure on rn 1 and equip pn with the right invariant mea sure jacquet and shilika proved the following theorem theorem 1 1 jacquet shalika 13 let h be a generic irre ducible unitary representation of g then whf pn l 2 c 1 u pn the whittaker model produces a unitary equivalence between pn h and r l 2 c 1 u pn here r stand for the right regular representa tion by mackey s theory r l 2 c 1 u pn is an irreducible unitary rep resentation of pn essentially the unique one with maximal gelfand kirillov dimension 18 this implies that pn h is already 2 irreducible which was conjectured by kirillov to be true for all irre ducible unitary representations of g in the literature whf pn is often known as the kirillov model here are our main results theorem 1 2 a let be an irreducible unitary representation of gl n with a whittaker model let f be a k finite vector in write a diag a 1 a 2 an 1 1 in the uak decomposition of gl n 1 then for any li n i 1 n 1 we have n 1 i 1 ai ai 1 liwhf pn l 2 c 1 u pn consequently n 1 i 1 ai liwhf pn l 2 c 1 u pn identify l 2 c 1 u pn with l 2 c 1 un 1 gl n 1 here un 1 u gl n 1 we have theorem 1 3 b let be an irreducible unitary representation of gl n with a whittaker model let f be a k finite vector in then whf gl n 1 l 2 c 1 un 1 gl n 1 det dg for any 0 indeed l 2 c 1 un 1 gl n 1 det dg provides us a unitary struc ture of the perturbed representation det 2 pn notice that det 2 is never unitary unless ir theorem a and b suggest that the asymptotic behavior of the whit taker function can be similarly understood the asymptotic behavior of the whittaker function whf g is well know for g in the siegel set however whf g outside the siegel set can also be important in this paper we prove the following theorem 1 4 c let v be the principal series defined over g mau suppose that v 1 v 2 vn let n 1 2 n 3 2 n 3 2 n 1 2 be the half sum of positive roots for a u for any f v any li n i 1 n 1 the function a v n 1 i 1 ai ai 1 liwhf g is bounded by a constant dependent on f and l hence whf g cf la v n 1 i 1 ai 1 ai li 3 the restriction imposed on v simply means that v is in the open nega tive weyl chamber of a c we shall remark that the asymptotic bound we obtain is the best possible bound notice that if is trivial and f is spherical as ai ai 1 0 for all possible i the whittaker function whf a will approach c v a v with c v harish chandra s c function 7 14 it can be easily verified that c v is not zero when v is in the open negative weyl chamber hence a v is the best possible ex ponent over the siegel set with ai ai 1 our theorem implies that whf g is fast decaying more generally theorem c gives effective bounds over g nak with a in all weyl chambers at the boundary where vi vi 1 for some i our theorem is no longer true in general but a weaker version with introduction of certain small or log terms is true in the general situation where is induced from discrete series of gl 2 and gl 1 one can embed into a principal series v with v in the closed negative weyl chamber similar statement remains true but it is unlikely that we can obtain the best results this way in fact one would have to use the leading exponents of to state theorem c correctly 14 21 there seems to be a deep connection between the asymptotes of the whittaker functions and leading exponents of we shall not pursue the asymptotes of the more general whittaker functions involving the discrete series of gl 2 in this paper finally we shall remark that theorem c holds for principal series v of all semisimple lie groups theorem 1 5 d let g be a semisimple lie group and nak its iwasawa decomposition let n be the opposite nilpotent group let g a be the positive restricted simple roots let v be a

otherwise stated allgl n in this paper will refer togl n r for n 2 the whittaker functions of gl 2 are classical whittaker functions and their asymptotes are well known 11 we shall from now on assume

known let s t u ua t k be the siegel set with u a lattice in u t 0 and a t a a ai ai 1 t i 1 n 1 let be an irreducible smooth representation with a whittaker model and f then for any l nn 1 and uak s t whf uak cl f n 1 i 1 ai ai 1 li 3 notice that with respect to the right invariant measure the siegel set has a finite measure hence this estimate is inadequate for the discus sion of whf g with g g the fast decaying property in equation 3 is also a special feature of cusp forms of g indeed in the main lemma of ch 1 6 harish chandra proved that if a smooth function of g with zero constant terms along the directions of maximal parabolics containing na then this function is fast decaying on the siegel set harish chandra s in tention was to apply this lemma to cusp forms it is not hard to see that the whittaker function whf g has zero constant terms for all parabolics containing na hence equation 3 also follows from harish chandra s lemma philosophically this observation provides us some initial evidence that many analytic properties of the whittaker func tions hold for cusp forms and vice versa we shall also remark that fast decaying property over siegel set is of ten rephrased simply by using the norm g n with g s 3 this is no longer good for the purpose of studying whf g for arbitrary g we have to go back to the classical iwasawa decomposition 3 1 general setup of principal series representation fix a minimal parabolic subgroup mau consisting of all invertible lower triangular matrices form the principal series representation 7 v with g g acting from the left on smooth functions of the form f gmau m 1 a vf g where 1 v g f x f g 1 x 2 n 1 2 n 3 2 n 1 2 is the half of the positive roots of u a 3 v hom a c cn is identified with the characters of a and av n i 1 a vi i 4 1 2 n is a character ofm diag 1 1 1 each v restricted to the center of gl n produces a central character diag a 1 a 1 a 1 n i 1 i sgn a 1 a 1 vi we may speak of representations of central character we use v to denote the linear space of all smooth vector f the function f is uniquely determined by its value on k and vice versa hence the smooth representation v can be identified with smooth sections of the vector bundle k m c this is often called the smooth compact picture or the compact model fix an invariant measure on k we now equip v c k m c k m with the l 2 norm on k m then v be comes a unitary representation when v is purely imaginary we use to denote the hilbert inner product associated with l 2 k m c in addition there is a canonical complex linear non degenerate pairing between v and v f 1 f 2 k m f 1 k f 2 k d k here and f 1 k f 2 k f 1 k f 2 k only depends on k k m it follows that v can be identified with v the dual representation of v let f denote the l 2 norm f l 2 k mc we equip v with the semi norms f x v x f with x u g then v becomes a frechet space its dual space consisting of continuous linear functionals contains v as a subspace it is often denoted by v we retain v g g g and v x x u g for the group action and lie algebra action on v 3 2 noncompact model and proof of theorem c by the bruhat decomposition the image of u in g mau is open and dense we consider the pull back i v c u 8 this is essentially the restriction map of f to the group u it is injec tive the group g acts on the image of i conformally i v is often called the noncompact model fix the invariant measure the euclidean measure on uij if v is purely imaginary then v g will be unitary operators on l 2 u hence we have a unitary repre sentation v l 2 u similarly we have a nondegenerate pairing between v and v f 1 f 2 u f 1 u f 2 u i j dui j we normalize the invariant measure on k so the pairing defined here is the same as the pairing defined over k m throughout this paper we shall use the noncompact model unless otherwise stated the following lemma is well known and crucial to the construction of the standard intertwining operator and jacquet s whittaker function lemma 3 1 suppose that v 1 v 2 vn let f v then f k is bounded and f n l 1 n indeed for any x u g v x f k will also be bounded see for example ch vii 8 9 10 in 14 write a c v a c v 1 v 2 vn we call this open negative weyl chamber in a c the closed negative weyl chamber cl a c v a c v 1 v 2 vn now we take m to be the function exp 2 i n 1 i 1 miui i 1 when v a c since all vectors in the noncompact model i v are in l 1 u the function exp 2 i n 1 i 1 miui i 1 defines a continuous linear functional on v we then analytically continue m of v to all cl a c lemma 3 2 we have v a 1 m a v ad a m where ad a m a 1 a 2 m 1 a 2 a 3 m 2 an 1 an mn 1 for the reason of bookkeeping we check that v a 1 m u m au m ad a ua a v m ad a u a v ad a m u let f 0 be the spherical vector of v triv with the property that f 0 k 1 then f 0 u l 1 u if v a c by lemma 3 1 in addition f 0 u 0 for all u u theorem 3 1 let v a c and f v then whf m ak cm f k supa v 9 proof observe that whf m ak v k f v a 1 m a v v k f ad a m expressed in the noncompact model whf m ak u v k f u ad a m u du every v k f u is bounded by f k supf 0 u even though f 0 u is the spherical vector of v triv our theorem then follows from lemma 3 1 proof of theorem c the proof is similar to the proof of theo rem a let us consider the element in the universal enveloping algebra u g x l x l 11 2 x l 2 2 3 x ln 1 n 1 n then wh v xl f m a v x l f v a 1 m by theorem 3 1 and lemm 2 1 n 1 i 1 2 miai ai 1 li whf m a is bounded by v x l f k supcma v similar statement is true for every v k f n 1 i 1 2 miai ai 1 li wh v k f m a v x l v k f k supcma v hence n 1 i 1 2 miai ai 1 li whf m ak cma v max k 0 k v x l v k 0 f k sup cma v max k 0 k v ad k 10 x l f k sup 3 3 some remarks on the general case theorem c can be generalized to cover the case v in the boundary of the negative weyl chamber but the exact same statement will not hold instead for v a c we have n 1 i 1 ai ai 1 liwhf g ca v where a c and n i 1 i 0 indeed we only require that i i 1 if vi vi 1 if vi vi 1 i i 1 will be 10 allowed obviously these bounds will not be the best bounds for many applications these bounds should be adequate we shall not pursue this here we are still left with induced representations from gl 1 and gl 2 factors by the theorem of kostant representations with whittaker model must have the largest gelfand kirillov dimension 15 by vo gan s classification of unitary dual of gl n 20 irreducible unitary generic representations are of the form ind g man with ma r 1 i 1 gl 2 r 2 i 1 gl 1 2 r 1 r 2 n r 1 i 1 d di vi di vi r 2 i 1 c i i here di z 2 vi ir i c i 1 the parameter satisfies the condition that the principal series of gl r 2 induced from is unitary d di vi di vi is the discrete series with harish chandra param eter 2 di and central character det vi the bounds for the whittaker functions of these is more difficult at the minimum we can em bedded as a subquotient of a certain principal series v such that v cl ac we will be able to obtain bounds on whf based on the bounds from the principal series v these bounds can be far from optimal the correct way to write down the bounds is to use leading exponents of v 14 when is a unitary representa tion of gl 1 factors the leading exponents are simply av for the general case the leading exponents are more complex hypothetically the whittaker functions in this general case should at least share the same kind of bounds as the spherical principal series 0 triv this should be adequate for applications in automorphic forms 4 perturbation of group action and uni tary structure let us get back to the setting of section 2 let h be an irreducible unitary representation of g with a whittaker model and f hk we would like to give a proof of theorem c and show that whf gl n 1 l 2 un 1 gl n 1 det s s 0 proof of theorem c by theorem a t n det twhf gl n 1 n 1 i 1 ai twhf gl n 1 l 2 c 1 un 1 gl n 1 11 observe that for any s 0 un 1 gl n 1 whf g 2 det g sd g un 1 gl n 1 det g 1 whf g 2 d g un 1 gl n 1 det g 1 whf g 2 det g 2 td g where t is an integer greater than s 2 now let us perturb the group action of we define an action of g on g g s g det g s g it is easy to check that s is a group representation of g it can never be endowed with a pre hilbert structure to make s unitary but the following theorem says that s pn can be made into a unitary representation indeed we can perturb the unitary whittaker model to obtain a unitary structure for s pn theorem 4 1 let s 0 the map wh f whf g pn l 2 c 1 u pn det 2 sd g yields a unitary structure of s pn here d g a 2 n 1 da a dk is the
