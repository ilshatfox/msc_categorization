tallahassee florida 32310 usa the centuries old idea of a lighter than air vacuum balloon has not materialized yet as such structure needs to be both light enough to float in the air and strong enough to withstand atmospheric pressure we propose a design of a rigid spherical sandwich shell and demonstrate that it can satisfy these stringent conditions with commercially available materials such as boron carbide ceramic and aluminum alloy honeycomb a finite element analysis was employed to demonstrate that buckling can be prevented in the proposed structure also discussed are other modes of

where buoyancy was to be created by evacuated copper spheres ref 1 see also ref 2 containing historical information related to the design however this dream has not materialized so far because it is very difficult to design and manufacture a shell that is light enough to float in the air and strong enough to reliably withstand the atmospheric pressure for example a f zahm ref 3 calculated the stress in a thin homogeneous one layer rigid shell with vacuum inside and zero buoyancy so that its mass equals that of the displaced air 4 3 3 4 2 1 where is the radius of the shell is the shell thickness and are the densities of air and of the shell material respectively we use an approximation for a thin shell let us then consider the condition of equilibrium for half of the shell see fig 1 2 2 2 where is the compressive stress in the shell and 101 is the atmospheric pressure at 0 c we used a condition of equilibrium for a hemisphere of air in the atmosphere to calculate the right hand side we obtain 3 3 2 3 if 2700 3 the density of aluminum 1 29 3 the density of air at 0 c and 1 atm 101 kpa and 1 01 105 then 1 6 10 4 320 i e the stress is of the same order of magnitude as the compressive strength of contemporary aluminum alloys it is important to note that this result does not depend on the radius of the shell t fig 1 stress and atmospheric pressure acting on a half of evacuated spherical shell not to scale a f zahm notes that while the results of stress calculation are quite problematic buckling is an even more dangerous mode of failure for such a structure let us perform a simple buckling analysis for this structure ref 4 the critical buckling pressure for a thin spherical shell is given by the well known formula of the linear theory of stability ref 5 2 2 3 1 2 2 4 where and are the modulus of elasticity and the poisson s ratio of the material of the shell respectively if and e g 0 3 then 2 9 3 1 2 2 2 4 5 10 5 1 5 2 5 even if we use diamond as the shell material 1 2 1012 and 3500 3 we obtain 2 10 5 1 5 2 6 in other words even the maximally optimized homogeneous diamond shell of ideally spherical shape would inevitably fail already at 0 2 thus one layer shells made of any solid material in existence either cannot float in the air or have no chance of withstanding the atmospheric pressure it should be noted that we only considered the spherical shape in our analysis as this shape is certainly the optimal one problems of this kind are quite common in aircraft design and typical solutions are multi layer shells with light core or stiffened shells in our patent application ref 4 we defined viable designs of a vacuum balloon based on three layer shells made of commercially available materials numerous patents and articles on vacuum balloons had been published earlier see e g ref 6 but to the best of our knowledge none of them properly addressed the crucial issue of buckling more recently other work addressing the issue of buckling for vacuum balloons was published see e g refs 7 11 and references there the recent popular articles on vacuum balloons refs 12 13 also reflect current interest in this topic as our design ref 4 garnered some interest it is advisable to describe it here in a journal article format after significant rework providing details of the all important buckling analysis detailed comparison with the vastly different designs featured in related work by others refs 7 11 would perhaps require finite element analysis of each proposed structure and is beyond the scope of this article we would just like to note that our design unlike many others is spherically symmetric and scalable multiplying all linear dimensions by the same factor provides an equally viable design see some caveats related to intracell buckling in section iii so it has fewer parameters as there is no dependence on the polar and azimuthal angles or absolute linear dimensions which facilitates its analytical optimization it is also noteworthy that the design does not contain any components under tension this may be advantageous for using materials such as ceramics whose compressive properties are typically much better than the tensile properties ii a sandwich vacuum balloon and its buckling analysis as an example let us consider a three layer spherical shell with face skins of equal thickness 1 2 and a core of aluminum alloy honeycomb of thickness 3 see fig 2 and fig 3 below fig 2 dimensions of a spherical sandwich shell not to scale a b fig 3 a fragment of a spherical sandwich shell a before and b after assembly not to scale in order to prove the design feasibility we used parameters of commercially available materials in our study boron carbide ceramic was chosen as the face skin material density 2500 3 elasticity modulus 460 compressive strength 3200 poisson s ratio 0 17 ref 14 plascore pamg xr 1 3 1 1 8 7 n 5056 honeycomb was chosen as the core material cell size 1 8 inch 3 2 nominal foil gauge 0 0007 inch 18 nominal density 3 1 pcf 50 3 bare compressive strength 340 psi 2 3 modulus 97 ksi 670 plate shear strength 250 psi 1 7 l 155 psi 1 1 w modulus 45 ksi 310 l 20 ksi 140 w ref 15 if is the radius of the shell we assume that 3 1 to assess the design feasibility we also anticipate that the shell allows a small payload fraction 0 1 the ratio of the mass of the payload at zero buoyancy and the mass of the displaced air then the condition of zero buoyancy has the following form 4 3 3 1 4 2 2 1 3 3 7 or 6 1 3 3 3 1 8 where 1 1 3 3 3 3 the buckling stability condition that we used is described by the following semi empirical formula for critical pressure obtained for three layer domes ref 16 2 1 3 1 2 2 1 3 2 2 1 3 9 in this case is the modulus of elasticity of the face skin material and is the maximum pressure at which the three layer shell is stable the requirements for core rigidity are discussed below but let us first find the values of 1 and 3 that maximize using eq 8 let us eliminate 1 from eq 9 2 1 3 3 3 6 3 10 the value of is maximal for 3 3 1 6 3 3 9 10 3 11 in that case the optimal values of 1 and are 1 1 1 3 3 3 6 3 9 10 5 1 37 12 this is a good indication that the design is feasible however we need to assess the buckling stability more accurately and consider other modes of failure we cannot rely on the results of the above analytical approach as it hinges on the semi empirical formula eq 9 from ref 16 the validity limits of this formula are not clear in particular it is not clear how this formula should be modified to take into account manufacturing imperfections when they are different from those in the shells of ref 16 the results of the above approach were verified and optimized by a finite element analysis fea using ansys which enabled us to compute the stress and strain in the shell components and to perform the eigenvalue buckling analysis which is actually a classical euler buckling analysis the results of the fea analysis confirmed that the analytical approach provides reasonable estimates and a good starting point for optimization in our case however we base the conclusions of this article on the results of the fea analysis not on the results of the analytical approach for the fea analysis a 2 d axisymmetric model in the spherical system of coordinates with due regard for corresponding boundary conditions at the edges was found sufficient and adequate fig 4 in this model plane 82 2 d high order 8 node elements which are well suited for curved boundaries were used for the finite element mesh in axisymmetric mode the mesh was heavily refined and the elements aspect ratios were appropriately adjusted fig 4 the ansys fea a a 2 d axisymmetric model and b an enlarged fragment of the 3 layer sandwich shell s solid model in the fea the anisotropic material properties of the honeycomb were treated in accordance with recommendations of a honeycomb manufacturer ref 17 p 20 for the sake of simplicity we assume that the honeycomb is a transversally isotropic material so the lesser of the two values of shear modulus from ref 15 was used which makes the results more conservative thus we used the following values the out of plane component of the modulus 670 the in plane components of the modulus 67 out of plane components of the shear modulus 140 the in plane component of the shear modulus 14 the poisson s ratio 10 5 very small values of the poisson s ratio and the in plane components of the modulus and the shear modulus were used to avoid singularities in accordance with ref 17 p 20 thus the ansys eigenvalue buckling analysis input includes the loads the output of the analysis is the eigenvalues buckling load multipliers which are the safety factors for buckling modes for the input loads the minimum eigenvalue obtained in the eigenvalue buckling analysis determines the critical buckling load as we load our structure with atmospheric pressure we have the following relation between the minimum eigenvalue and the critical buckling pressure 13 the optimized parameters of the analytical approach were used as initial values for optimization through the fea the eigenvalue regarded as a function of 3 has a rather sharp maximum of 2 65 see fig 5 for a value of 3 3 53 10 3 which is close to the value we arrived at using the simplified method the corresponding value of 1 approximates 4 23 10 5 to give an idea of how the eigenvalue varies with the payload fraction let us note that is approximately 3 21 for an optimized design with zero payload fraction fig 5 the 3 least eigenvalues and from the ansys eigenvalue buckling analysis versus the relative core thickness for payload fraction the safety factor of 2 65 is not very high as empirical knock down factors are typically applied to the results of small deflection analysis for externally pressurized thin walled spherical shells to take into account initial imperfections and other factors for example the knock down factor of 0 2 is recommended in ref 18 p 6 9 for hemispherical sandwich domes there is a very good agreement between our fea results and the results obtained with the use of formulas in ref 18 p 6 6 with a knock down factor of 1 for buckling critical pressure stress the formulas of ref 18 are based on the solution from refs 19 20 if we perform linear and if required non linear buckling analysis with due regard for imperfections of manufacturing the safety factors will decrease but the obtained results are high enough to reasonably expect that the safety factors will still be quite sufficient for the state of the art manufacturing accuracy as thoroughly manufactured thin spherical shells were shown to withstand external pressure of up to 80 90 of the critical one refs 21 22 the relevant variation of thickness of the shallow spherical shells in the experiments of refs 21 22 was about 1 of the thickness in our design if the radius is 2 5 the thickness of the sandwich shell is about 9 see the dimensions in conclusion so the comparable manufacturing accuracy would be about 0 1 while such accuracy may be difficult to achieve the knock down coefficient of 0 2 is conservative according to the review of experimental results on buckling of spherical shells in ref 23 the knock down factors for various technologies often exceed 0 4 which would be sufficient in our case for payload factor of 0 1 if necessary incoming testing of sandwich plates can be performed before the assembly of the shell to make sure the knock down factor for the plates exceeds the required value only homogeneous spherical shells are discussed in refs 21 23 and information on spherical sandwich shells is scarce but the results and recommendations of ref 16 suggest similar conclusions taking into account the imperfections in the finite element analysis is beyond the scope of this work as the imperfections depend on the specific technologies iii other modes of failure now let us verify that other modes of failure are not problematic for the design we used standard unity checks from refs 17 24 providing detailed descriptions of the failure modes and explanations of the standard formulas here does not seem warranted let us first check that the compressive stress in the face skins does not exceed the compressive strength of the face skin material instead of eq 2 we have 2 2 1 2 4 1 600 14 which is much less than the compressive strength of boron carbide 3 2 the following formula is used to check the design for shear crimping ref 17 pp 8 19 ref 24 pp 245 246 3 3 0 49 15 where is the allowable force per unit length of a sandwich plate in some direction and 3 20 138 is the honeycomb shear modulus the actual force per unit length is much less 2 1 51 16 the design was checked for face skin wrinkling using the following formula ref 24 p 234 2 3 1 3 17 where is the allowable uniaxial wrinkling stress 2 0 82 is a theoretically derived coefficient for honeycomb cores 460 is the face skin modulus 3 97 ksi 0 69 gpa is the honeycomb modulus we obtain 1 58 however we have biaxial stress so we should check that ref 24 p 235 3 3 1 3 2 1 18 where and are stresses in two orthogonal directions 600 is the shear stress 0 0 95 the left side of eq 18 equals approximately 0 5 so this check also yields a satisfactory result the design is scalable with respect to all of the above modes of failure an equally successful design can be obtained by multiplying all linear dimensions by the same factor however this is not true for another mode of failure so called intracell buckling also known as dimpling we use the following formula ref 24 p 241 2 1 2 1 2 19 where is the critical stress for intracell buckling and 0 17 is the poisson s ratio of the face skins and 1 8 3 2 is the cell size we obtain 168 2 2 however we have biaxial stress so we must make sure that ref 24 p 242 1 0 8 2 1 20 where 3 if the cell size 15 63 1 that means 4 8 for our values of and 1 and 3 otherwise see ref 24 p 243 if 4 8 we have 2 1 3 2 1 21 and condition 20 is satisfied if 4 8 we have 2 1 3 134 2 2 or 2 11 thus we obtain the following condition of stability for intracell buckling 2 11 we did not study possible effects of small leaks in the face skins but they should not present a greater problem than for other vacuum systems as only rough vacuum is required for vacuum balloons if pressure difference in neighboring honeycomb cells is a concern one may need to use a honeycomb with cell perforations ref 15 iv towards a prototype vacuum balloon manufacturing of the boron carbide face skins seems to be the most challenging part of the design as they may be very thin and their density needs to be close to the theoretical boron carbide density otherwise the elasticity modulus can be insufficient for large prototypes 25 the face skin thickness exceeds 1 and parts of the face skins can be produced using traditional methods such as uniaxial pressing with subsequent sintering refs 25 26 for smaller prototypes the thickness of the face skins is 0 1 by order of magnitude producing such parts is technologically challenging and the parts may be too fragile detailed treatment of these issues is beyond the scope of this article but a preliminary discussion is clearly necessary the face skins can be produced either by deposition on a sacrificial substrate this can be time consuming if the process is to yield high elasticity modulus or using gelcasting which can provide fine features down to 100 scale ref 27 another approach to manufacturing uniform spherical boron carbide shells with a thickness of the order of 100 by dropping a slurry coating on a molybdenum substrate and subsequent drainage and curing is described in ref 28 while the radius of the shells in ref 28 is small 1 the method was used with different materials to manufacture shells of a radius of up to 375 ref 29 shells of larger radius can probably be manufactured by varying the viscosity of the slurry and or using rotation to circumvent the issue of fragility one can first bond the face skins to the honeycomb and then remove the face skin supports the substrates or parts of the molds to fabricate the entire vacuum balloon one will need to join several sandwich panels using some standard approach such as bonded butt joints using h sections ref 30 p 5 the weight penalty is not estimated in this article but it will be smaller for larger sandwich panels according to ref 31 in terms of volume efficiency convex stellated shells are comparable to spherical shells with a knockdown factor of 0 65 so the former can achieve better buckling efficiency than the latter when the effects of geometric imperfections are considered if a similar conclusion is also true for sandwich shells then sandwich stellated shells can be another option for vacuum balloons in terms of manufacturing such shells can be attractive as they can be assembled using flat sandwich panels the exterior and the interior of the structure can be connected with a valve at a modest weight penalty for initial evacuation of the structure or for altitude control the buoyant force reduction due to the shell compression by atmospheric pressure was calculated to be less than 0 4 point loading of the structure should be avoided for example it is relatively easy to provide distributed support with larger contact area for the structure on the ground we did not discuss issues related to adhesives here mass requirements modes of failure etc but these issues are less significant for shells of larger radius as the adhesive mass scales as 2 and the mass of the entire structure scales as 3 neither did we discuss potential use of more exotic materials such as chemical vapor deposition cvd diamond for the face skins or architected cellular materials ref 13 for the core to significantly increase safety factors and or the payload fraction v conclusion we showed that a lighter than air rigid vacuum balloon can theoretically be built using commercially available materials the design of this article is an evacuated spherical sandwich shell of outer radius 2 11 containing two boron carbide face skins of thickness 4 23 10 5 each that are reliably bonded to an aluminum honeycomb core of thickness 3 52 10 3 the structure is lighter than air it allows a payload fraction of 0 1 and can withstand the atmospheric pressure for example if 2 5 the face skin thickness is 106 the honeycomb thickness is 8 8 the mass of the shell is 75 7 the payload capacity for zero buoyancy is 8 7 a prototype vacuum balloon would also become the first ever lighter than air solid for example aerogels are actually not lighter than air due to the air inside manufacturing a prototype vacuum balloon will be a major breakthrough it will require detailed engineering to resolve numerous relatively minor issues but the results of this article suggest that we can finally bring to fruition the ancient dream of a vacuum balloon it took mathematicians 357 years to prove fermat s last theorem will it take us more to build the first vacuum balloon acknowledgments a portion of this work is performed at
