ar x iv 2 00 9 11 36 9 v 1 m at h n a 2 3 s ep 2 02 0 a personal perspective on numerical analysis and optimization desmond j higham 1 abstract i give a brief non technical historical perspective on numerical analysis and optimization i also touch on emerging trends and future challenges this content is based on the short presentation that i made at the opening ceremony of the international conference on numerical analysis and op timization which was held at sultan qaboos university muscat oman on january 6 9 2020 of course the material covered here is necessarily incom plete and biased towards my own interests and comfort zones my aim is to give a feel for how the area has developed over the past few decades and how it may continue 1 definitions mathematicians love to make definitions but defining an area of mathematics is a thankless task the best one sentence definitions that i can come up with for numerical analysis and optimization are as follows numerical analysis the design analysis and implementation of computa tional algorithms to deliver approximate solutions to problems arising in applied mathematics optimization the design analysis and implementation of computational algorithms to approximate the best solution to a problem arising in applied mathematics when there may be many feasible solutions for alternative versions i refer to the references 3 24

computational algorithms can be attributed to two main factors first technology has advanced rapidly and consistently since the digital computing era began in the 1950 s the cdc 6600 widely acknowledged to be the world s first supercomputer was introduced in 1964 achieving a speed of 3 megaflops that is 3 106 float ing operations per second 17 today s fastest supercomputers can achieve petaflop speeds 1015 floating operations per second by contrast in his 1970 turing award lecture 28 1971 james wilkinson discussed the use of mechanical desk calculators it happened that some time after my arrival at the national physical laboratory in 1946 a system of 18 equations arrived in mathematics division and after talking around it for some time we finally decided to abandon theorizing and to solve it the operation was manned by fox goodwin turing and me and we decided on gaussian elimination with complete pivoting leslie fox 12 noted that the computation referred to in this quotation took about two weeks to complete by my estimation this corresponds to around 0 003 floating operations per second a second and equally important factor behind the rise of scientific com putation is the availability of ever increasing sources of data caused by im provements in experimental techniques and perhaps most notably by the inexorable sensorization and digitization of our everyday lives hence al though numerical analysis and optimization build on classical ideas that can be attributed to the likes of newton euler lagrange and gauss they con tinue to be shaped by current developments of course many disciplines make extensive use of computational techniques for example the word compu tational often appears before the words biology chemistry physics and social science furthermore computational science and engineering 23 is a well established discipline that is often referred to as the third leg of the science and engineering stool equal in stature to observation and the ory in addition many graduate schools now offer courses with titles such as data analytics and data science although there is clearly much over lap my view is that numerical analysis and optimization have a distinct role of focusing on the design and analysis of algorithms for problems in applied mathematics in terms of complexity accuracy and stability and hence they are informed by but not driven by application fields 3 reflections my own exposure to numerical analysis and optimization dates back to the mid 1980 s when i enrolled on an msc course on numerical analysis and history of numerical analysis 3 programming at the university of manchester the course in which opti mization was treated as a branch of numerical analysis made heavy use of the series of textbooks published by wiley that was written by members of the highly influential numerical analysis group at the university of dundee 27 here are the topics and most recent versions of these books approximation theory 26 numerical methods for odes 18 numerical methods for pdes 22 25 and optimization 11 an additional topic was numerical linear alge bra 14 each of these topics remains active and highly relevant numerical linear algebra and optimization are often important building blocks within larger computational tasks and hence their popularity has never waned par tial differential equations lie at the heart of most models in the natural and engineering sciences and they come in many varieties giving rise to an ever expanding problem set timestepping methods for odes gained impetus through the concept of geometric integration 15 and now play a prominent role in the development of tools for statistical sampling 6 ode simulation also forms a key component in certain classes of neural network as described in 7 which received a best paper award at neurips 2018 a leading con ference in machine learning approximation theory lies at the heart of the current deep learning revolution 16 19 and in particular understanding very high dimensional data spaces and or parameter spaces remains a fun damental challenge 4 impact in a special issue of the journal computing in science and engineering jack dongarra and francis sullivan published their top ten list of algorithms that had the greatest influence on the development and practice of science and engineering in the 20 th century 9 these were metropolis algorithm for monte carlo simplex method for linear programming krylov subspace iteration methods the decompositional approach to matrix computations the fortran optimizing compiler qr algorithm for computing eigenvalues quicksort algorithm for sorting fast fourier transform integer relation detection fast multipole method here the word algorithm is being used in a very general sense but it is clear that most of these achievements have ideas from numerical analysis and optimization at their heart 4 desmond j higham researchers in numerical analysis and optimization are in the advanta geous position that their work is not only recorded in journals and text books but may also be made operational through public domain software many authors now deposit code alongside their academic publications and state of the art code is available in a wide range of languages and platforms including fortran c r matlab maple scientific python and the more recent julia 4 5 momentum judging by the level of activity around graduate classes seminar series con ferences and journals there is a strong pull for further research in numerical analysis and optimization particularly active and overlapping directions include dealing with or exploiting randomness both in the simulation of math ematical models that are inherently stochastic 20 and in the use of randomization in solving deterministic problems 8 21 accurately and efficiently simulating mathematical models that operate over a vast range of temporal or spatial scales 10 13 tackling problems of extremely high dimension notably large scale opti mization and inverse problems in machine learning and imaging 2 5 exploiting the latest computer architectures and designing algorithms that efficiently trade off between issues such as memory bandwidth data access communication and perhaps most topically the use of low preci sion special function units 1 such items and may others emphasize that important challenges remain for researchers in numerical analysis and optimization in the design evalua tion and extension of the modern computational scientist s toolbox
