parametrized by a set s the prequantum hilbert spaces produced by geometric quantization using the half form correction also depends on these parameters this way we obtain a field of hilbert spaces p hprq s we show that this field can have natural inequivalent smooth hilbert bundle structures 1 introduction let mm be an m dimensional compact riemannian manifold that is the con figuration space of a classical mechanical system geometric quantization intends to construct a hilbert space the quantum hilbert space associated to this system in a natural way according to the recipe of kostant and souriau ko so w the first step in this process is to pass to phase space n where is a symplectic form and then to choose a hermitian line bundle with connection e n with curvature i the prequantum hilbert space hprq then consists of the l 2 sections of e for physical reasons this hilbert space is too big and one needs to reduce its size hence the next step is to select a hilbert subspace of hprq frequently this is done with the help of a complex structure on n if is a ka hler form e also inherits a holomorphic structure and one can take the quantum hilbert space h to be the holomorphic l 2 sections of e often one includes in this construction the so called half form correction assume that the canonical bundle kn admits a square root then the corrected prequantum hilbert space consists of the l 2 sections of e and the corrected quantum hilbert space hcorr consists of the holomorphic l 2 sections of e in certain situations not only one but an entire family parametrized by a set s of complex structures exists on n resulting a family of quantum hilbert spaces hs or hcorrs the question then arises is it possible to identify these hilbert spaces in a canonical way suppose the set s admits a smooth manifold structure axelrod et al adw and hitchin hi suggest to view the family hs s s or hcorrs as the fibers of a hilbert bundle h s resp hcorr s endowed with some hermitian connec tion the quantum connection in situations when this is true parallel transport along a curve in s would yield a unitary map between different fibers if furthermore the quantum connection was flat we would even have a locally path independent method of identification now in the uncorrected situation hprq is fixed it does not depend on the pa rameter s since hs are all closed subspaces of this hilbert space to implement the idea above we could try to view this family as the fibers of a hilbert subbundle 2000 mathematics subject classification 53 d 50 53 c 35 32 l 10 70 g 45 65 key words and

hilbert bundle l s hprq s in this case the quan tum connection would arise from the canonical flat hermitian connection on l by orthogonal projection in very specific situations adw w this works but we are not aware of any general theorem that would guarantee that h s is indeed a hilbert subbundle of l in the corrected version a further difficulty arises the prequantum hilbert spaces hprqs the l 2 sections of e s themselves are no longer fixed but form a family of which the corrected quantum hilbert spaces form a family of hilbert subspaces thus before we try to show that hcorrs s s is a subbundle of hprqs s s we need to see whether hprqs s s forms a hilbert bundle or not the main purpose of this note is to demonstrate that in certain cases there are at least two natural inequivalent ways to make hprqs a hilbert bundle the topology on these bundles is the same but their smooth structure and therefore the set of smooth sections are different this is the content of theorem 5 1 therefore it is better not to try to explain the smooth structure and the quantum connection on hcorr as in adw fmmn 1 fmmn 2 through hprq but rather do it directly using the family of complex structures defined on n this was our motivation and reason why we introduced in lsz 14 the notion of smooth and analytic fields of hilbert spaces generalizing hilbert bundles with a hermitian connection it is not clear whether hcorr s really forms a smooth hilbert subbundle or not in hprq equipped with either of the smooth structures considered in theorem 5 1 2 a unitary representation of a the affine semigroup a is the semigroup of affine transformations r r t 7 a bt where a b r here a and b provide global coordinates on a and identify it with r 2 with this single coordinate chart a becomes a lie semigroup the subset of a with b 0 forms a lie sub group that we shall denote by a in the above coordinates a is identified as a smooth manifold with the upper half plane s a acts naturally not only on r but on c as well for an s s let s a be the unique element with s i s the map s a s 7 s is simply the inverse of the coordinate chart of a the curves r a defined as 2 1 u t 7 u t u t 7 eut are 1 parameter subgroups in a and 0 0 form a basis in its lie algebra define the homomorphism a 0 by b if t a bt let nowmm be an m dimensional compact smooth manifold equipped with a riemannian metric we take the phase space n to be the manifold of parametrized geodesics x r m any t 0 r induces a diffeomorphism n x 7 x t 0 tm and the pull back of the canonical symplectic form of tm t m is independent of t 0 cf w that we shall denote by associating with a point q m the constant geodesic q identifies m as a submanifold in n in the tm picture this is just the zero section of the tangent bundle composition of geodesics with the elements of a defines a right action of a on n induced by this action we get the vector fields x y on n corresponding to 0 and 0 when n is replaced by tm x is the vector field induced by the geodesic flow and y corresponds to the euler vector field for a x n let a n n be defined by a x x as one easily checks 2 2 a smooth structures on the field of prequantum hilbert spaces 3 let e m m be the liouville volume form on n from 2 2 we get 2 3 a e me denote by l 2 n e the complex valued square integrable w r t the volume form e functions on n and u l 2 n e the unitary self maps of this hilbert space theorem 2 1 with a the map 2 4 l 2 n e l 2 n e f 7 m 2 f a is unitary and yields a unitary representation a u l 2 n e the map 2 5 a l 2 n e l 2 n e defined by f f is continuous but not differentiable proof 2 3 implies n f 2 e n m f a 2 e n a f 2 e n f 2 e hence in 2 4 is unitary also if a f m 2 f a m 2 f a a m 2 f a f shows that is a representation we prove the continuity of in two steps first step let g l 2 n e and a be fixed assume that g is continuous with compact support we want to show that when f l 2 n e is close to g and a is close to then f is close to g in the rest of the proof norm always refers to the l 2 norm w r t the volume form e f g f g g g f g g g since is unitary g g 2 n m 2 g a m 2 g a 2 e n m 1 m 2 g a 1 g 2 a e n 1 m 2 g a 1 g 2 e because is also unitary this implies g g n 1 m 2 1 2 g a 1 2 e n g a 1 g 2 e denote the two terms on the right hand side by i and ii using the unitarity of 1 we get i 1 m 2 1 m 2 1 g if is close to 1 is near to 1 and so i is close to zero also in this case a 1 is close to the identity diffeomorphism of n because of our choice g 4 ro bert szo ke is uniformly continuous on its support consequently ii is also near to zero all these imply the continuity of in g second step let now g l 2 n e be arbitrary choose a g 1 near g that is continuous with compact support let f l 2 n e then f g f g g g 1 g 1 g 1 g 1 g f g g g 1 g 1 g 1 g 1 g and applying the first step to g 1 we get the continuity of in g to justify that is not differentiable it suffices to show that its partial derivative with respect to the variable does not exist consider the 1 parameter subgroups in a from 2 1 and let g l 2 n e be arbitrary then s g g a s s g e sm 2 g a s so we would get d ds s 0 s g xg d ds s 0 s g m 2 g yg of course for a generic g neither xg nor yg exists and even if it does it is not necessarily square integrable 3 adapted complex structures first we recall some important facts on adapted complex structures mainly from lsz 12 if we are given a complex manifold structure on a a complex structure on n is called adapted if for every x n the orbit map a 7 x n is holomorphic an adapted complex structure on n can exist only if the initial compex structure on a is left invariant the left invariant complex structures on a are parametrized by the points of c r for each s c r and corresponding left invariant complex structure i s on a if an i s adapted complex structure j s exists on n then this structure is unique and if j i exists then j s also exists for all s in s c r it is not easy to find such riemannian manifoldsm for which j i exists the only known examples are certain surfaces of revolution sz 91 compact normal riemannian homogeneous spaces sz 98 some examples obtained from the homogeneous examples using the method of symplectic reduction ag one can also take products or coverings of such spaces but these are all we know so far the original definition of adapted complex structures in lsz 91 corresponds to the parameter s i recall that s denotes the upper half plane for s s n j s becomes a ka hler manifold denote its canonical bundle by ks if s i we simply write k instead of ki proposition 3 1 assume m is oriented then the bundle ks is holomorphically trivial this is lemma 10 4 1 in lsz 14 but for the readers sake we include its short proof here proof according to lsz 12 theorem 6 c the map a s n j s n j i is a biholomorphism therefore it is enough to deal with the case s i since n j i is a stein manifold lsz 91 theorem 5 6 by the oka principle h pp 144 145 it suffices to show that k is smoothly trivial m is a deformation retract in n so we only need to show that k m is trivial since m is oriented the bundle km m of real m forms is trivial but restricting a form in k m to tm is an isomorphism k m c km and we are done smooth structures on the field of prequantum hilbert spaces 5 it is interesting that although the canonical bundle k is trivial the first guess for a trivializing holomorphic section is wrong namely if one takes the m 0 com ponent of the volume form ofm and extend it holomorphically to n assuming that such an extension exists not only in a neighborhood of m in n this holomorphic m 0 form may have zeroes in n m so it is not a trivializing section of k this is the case for example for those surface of revolution metrics on the two sphere in sz 91 the formula 3 1 hs e x im 2 x n ksx defines a hermitian metric hs on k s write h for hi due to the proposition when m is orientable there is a hermitian holomor phic in fact trivial line bundle h so that h 2 k h let be a trivializing holomorphic section of k and the corresponding section of with taking s a s h s a s h we have s s h 2 s k s hs let s a s and s a s proposition 3 2 hs s s im s mh a s h s s s 2 hs s s proof since s im s 3 1 and 2 3 implies s s a s a s h i m 2 e i m 2 im s m h a s e using 3 1 once again we obtain the first formula from which the second follows from the definitions 4 the field of prequantum hilbert spaces the prequantum line bundle is a hermitian line bundle e n with a hermitian connection whose curvature is i when m is simply connected it is unique in any case one such line bundle is the trivial line bundle e n c n with the trivial metric he x 2 on it the connection on e is obtained from a real 1 form a on n such that da such a exists since is the pull back of the canonical symplectic form of t m let be the canonical section of e i e that is defined by x x 1 x n then all the sections of e have the form f where f n c and the connection on e is defined by e f f ia where is any smooth complex vector field on n the half form corrected pre quantum hilbert space hprqs corresponding to the ka hler manifold n j s s s is the hilbert space of l 2 sections of the bundle e s since s is a nowhere vanishing section of e s h prq s fs s fs n c n fs 2 h s s s e let hprq s shprqs be the disjoint union of these hilbert spaces p hprq s is the natural projection map at the moment there is no further structure defined yet on the set hprq except that the fibers p 1 s are hilbert spaces p hprq s is an example that we call cf lsz 14 a field of hilbert spaces 6 ro bert szo ke 5 smooth hilbert bundle structures on hprq the map l s l 2 n e a hprq s f 7 f h s s s s is a fiber preserving bijection and its restriction to each fiber is unitary therefore pushing forward l with a equips hprq with a smooth in fact trivial hilbert bundle structure the canonical flat hermitian connection on l yields an orthogonal connection on hprq when m is a compact lie group equipped with a biinvariant metric this is the hilbert bundle structure with hermitian connection chosen by c florentino p matias j moura o and j nunes in their papers fmmn 1 fmmn 2 except that they do not consider the full parameter space s only the positive imaginary axes but this is not the only possible natural way to equiphprq with a hilbert bundle structure let s fs s hprqs then from proposition 3 2 we get s 2 l 2 n fs 2 h s s s e im s m 2 n fs 2 h a s e im s m 2 n a s fs 2 a 1 s h e im s m 2 n fs 2 a 1 s h e therefore the map hprq b l s l 2 n e fs s 7 s im s m 4 fs a 1 s h 1 4 is a fiber preserving bijection whose restriction to each fiber is unitary by pulling back the hilbert bundle structure of l with b the hilbert field p hprq s inherits another smooth in fact trivial hilbert bundle structure we claim that as a smooth bundle this is different from the one we obtained with the help of the map a earlier theorem 5 1 the hilbert bundle structures on p hprq s obtained by the maps a and b are the same as topological hilbert bundles but their smooth struc tures are different proof using proposition 3 2 we calculate the map b a l l to be s f 7 s im s m 2 f a 1 s s s 1 f it follows from theorem 2 1 that the fiberwise unitary map b a is a homeomor phism but it is not differentiable acknowledgement we thank la szlo lempert for
