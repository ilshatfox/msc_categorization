cubic lagrange elements satisfying exact incompressibility johnny guzma n and l ridgway scott abstract we prove that an analog of the scott vogelius finite elements are inf sup stable on certain nondegenerate meshes for piecewise cubic velocity fields we also characterize the diver gence of the velocity space on such meshes in addition we show how such a characterization relates to the dimension of c 1 piecewise quartics on the same mesh 2010 65 n 30 65 n 12 76 d 07 65 n 85 1 introduction in 1985 scott and vogelius 13 see also 16 presented a family of piecewise polynomial spaces in two dimensions that yield solutions to the stokes equations with velocity approximations that are exactly divergence free the velocity space consists of continuous piecewise polynomials of degree k 4 and the pressure space is taken to be the divergence of the velocity space moreover they proved stability of the method by establishing that the pair of spaces satisfy the so called inf sup condition assuming that the meshes are quasi uniform and that the maximum mesh size is sufficiently small in a recent paper 7 we gave an alternative proof of the inf sup stability for k 4 on more general meshes assuming only that they are non degenerate shape regular one key aspect in the proof is to use the stability of the p 2 p 0 or the bernardi raugel 4 finite element spaces as a result the proof becomes significantly shorter here we utilize and extend the techniques to the case k 3 the case k 3 has been considered earlier 11 one key concept in this paper is the notion of a local interpolating vertex roughly speaking this is an interior vertex z such that for every finite element pressure p we can find a discrete velocity v in the finite element velocity space such that div v z p z with support in the patch of z and such that div v 0 for all other vertices moreover we require that div v has zero mean on each triangle we then show that if all interior vertices are local interpolating vertices then the inf sup stability holds see theorem 1 we generalize this result to show that if some interior vertices are local interpolating and that there are acceptable paths from any other vertex to one of the local interpolating vertices then the inf sup condition holds see theorem 2 in 7 we showed that all interior vertices are local interpolating vertices if piecewise quartic velocities or higher are used in this article we show that a generic interior vertex is local interpolating if piecewise cubics are used for the velocity space in particular we show that singular vertices and vertices with odd number of triangles touching it are local interpolating vertices in the case that a non singular interior vertex has an even number of triangles touching it then we give sufficient conditions for it to be a local interpolating vertex although a generic date november 19 2018 1 ar x iv 1 71 2 00 67 2 v 1 m at h n a 2 d ec 2 01 7 2 j guzma n and r scott interior vertex is a local interpolating vertex there are important meshes were no interior vertex is locally interpolating e g a diagonal mesh it is known that the c 1 piecewise quartic space which we denote by s 4 h is related to the piecewise cubic lagrange space surprisingly the dimension of s 4 h has not been verified for all meshes but it has been verified for a large class of meshes see 10 1 in the last sections of this paper we use the onto ness of the divergence operator of piecewise cubics to verify the dimension of s 4 h for a large class of meshes we also are able to verify the dimension of s 4 h which are c 1 piecewise quartic space with functions vanishing on the boundary to second order the paper is organized as follows in the following section we begin with preliminaries in section 3 we identify vertices at which we can interpolate pressure vertex values with the divergence of localized velocity fields in section 6 we prove the inf sup stability for k 3 under some restrictive assumptions on the mesh in section 7 we characterize the divergence of piecewise cubics on a broader class of meshes than considered in section 6 in section 8 we compare our the results with those of 11 in section 9 we relate our results to the dimension of c 1 piecewise quartics 2 preliminaries we assume is a polygonal domain in two dimensions we let th h be a non degenerate shape regular family triangulation of see 5 the set of vertices and the set of internal edges are denoted by sh x x is a vertex of th eh e e is an edge of th and e 6 we also let s inth and s h denote all the interior vertices and boundary vertices respectively define the internal edges eh z and triangles th z that have z sh as a vertex via eh z e eh z is a vertex of e th z t th z is a vertex of t finally we define the patch h z t th z t the diameter of this patch is denoted by 2 1 hz diam h z to define the pressure space we must define singular and non singular vertices let z sh and suppose that th z t 1 t 2 tn enumerated so that tj tj 1 share an edge for j 1 n 1 and tn and t 1 share an edge in the case z is an interior vertex if z is a boundary vertex then we enumerate the triangles such that t 1 and tn have a boundary edge let j denote the angle between the edges of tj originating from z define z max sin 1 2 sin n 1 n sin n 1 if z is an interior vertex max sin 1 2 sin n 1 n if z is a boundary vertex definition 2 1 a vertex z sh is a singular vertex if z 0 it is non singular if z 0 inf sup stability of cubic lagrange stokes elements 3 z z z z figure 1 example of singular vertices z dashed edges denote boundary edges this is equivalent to the original definition given in 9 16 we denote all the non singular vertices by s 1 h x sh x is non singular that is x 0 and all singular vertices by s 2 h sh s 1 h we also define for i 1 2 s i int h s i h s int h and si h s i h s h let q be a function such that q t c t for all t th for each vertex z s 2 h define 2 2 azh q n j 1 1 j 1 q tj z the scott vogelius finite element spaces for k 1 are defined by vkh v c 0 2 v t p k t 2 t th qk 1 h q l 2 0 q t p k 1 t t th azh q 0 for all z s 2 h here p k t is the space of polynomials of degree less than or equal to k defined on t also l 20 denotes the subspace of l 2 of functions that have average zero on we also make the following definition vkh 0 v v k h t div v dx 0 for all t th the definition of qk 1 h is based on the following result 14 lemma 1 for k 1 div vkh q k 1 h the goal of this article is to prove the inf sup stability of the pair vkh q k 1 h for k 3 for certain meshes definition 2 2 the pair of spaces vkh q k 1 h is inf sup stable on a family of triangulations th h if there exists 0 such that for all h 2 3 q l 2 sup v vk h v 6 0 q div v dx v h 1 q qk 1 h 2 1 notation for piecewise

notation for single triangle for z sh and e eh z where e z y let tze e 1 y z be a unit vector tangent to e where e denotes the length of the edge e then 2 5 tze y 1 e on e more generally suppose that t th y and let g be the edge of t that is opposite to y see figure 2 let n y t be the unit normal vector to g that points out of t then 2 6 y t 1 h y t n y t where h y t is the distance of y to the line defined by the edge g if z is another vertex of t and e z y then 2 7 h y t e sin where is the angle between the edges of t emanating from z 2 2 preliminary stability results the following is a consequence of the stability of the bernardi raugel 4 finite element spaces proposition 1 let k 1 there exists a constant 1 such that for every p qk 1 h there exists a v v 2 h such that t div v dx t p dx for all t th and v h 1 1 p l 2 inf sup stability of cubic lagrange stokes elements 5 the constant 1 is independent of p and only depends on the shape regularity of the mesh and the next result is a simple consequence of lemma 2 5 of 16 and is based on a simple counting argument proposition 2 let k 1 there exists a constant 2 0 such that for every p qk 1 h with p z 0 for all z sh and t p dx 0 for all t th there exists v vkh such that div v p on and v h 1 2 p l 2 using the above results we can prove inf sup stability as long as we can interpolate pressure vertex values with the divergence of velocity fields this is the subject of the next result lemma 2 suppose there exists a constant 3 0 such that for every p q 2 h there exists a v v 3 h 0 satisfying div v p 0 for all sh 2 8 with the bound v h 1 3 p l 2 then 2 3 holds for k 3 with 1 1 3 1 1 2 1 3 1 1 proof let p be an arbitrary function in q 2 h first we let v 1 be from proposition 1 we define p 1 p div v 1 then from our hypothesis let v 2 v 3 h 0 be such that div v 2 p 1 0 for all sh letting p 2 p 1 div v 2 we see that p 2 satisfies the hypotheses of proposition 2 and we let v 3 be the resulting vector field then we set w v 1 v 2 v 3 then we see that div w p on and 2 9 w h 1 1 3 1 1 2 1 3 1 1 p l 2 hence p 2 l 2 p div wdx w h 1 sup v v 3 h v 6 0 p div v dx v h 1 the result now follows after applying 2 9 hence one way of proving inf sup stability is two establish the hypothesis of lemma 2 this is going to be the task of the next sections 6 j guzma n and r scott 3 locally interpolating vertex values in this section we will identify vertices at which we can interpolate pressure vertex values with the divergence of velocity fields we first define the local spaces vkh z v v k h supp v h z vkh 0 z v v k h z t div v dx 0 for all t th z vkh 00 z v v k h 0 z div v 0 for all sh 6 z suppose that z sh and that th z t 1 t 2 tn ordered as described following 2 1 then in view of 2 2 we define w z a 1 an rn if z s 2 h then n j 1 1 j 1 aj 0 note that if z s 1 h is non singular then w z r n and there is a constraint if z is singular definition 1 let z sh and suppose that th z t 1 t 2 tn we say that z is a local interpolating vertex if for every a 1 an w z there exists a v v 3 h 00 z such that 3 1 div v tj z aj for all 1 j n if z sh is a local interpolating vertex then given a a 1 an w z we define ma v v 3 h 00 z v satisfying 3 1 also we set 3 2 dz max a 1 an w z min v ma v l h z max 1 j n aj we let lh be the collection of all local interpolating vertices then definition 3 2 says that if z lh then given a w z there exists v v 3 h 00 z satisfying 3 1 and v l h z dz max 1 j n aj in the next section we identify local interpolating vertices it will be useful to define funda mental vector fields used in 7 for every z sh and e eh z with e z y define 3 3 ze 2 z y let t 1 and t 2 be the two triangles that have e as an edge then we can easily verify the following see also 7 supp ze t 1 t 2 3 4 a ze 0 for sh and 6 z 3 4 b ze l t 1 t 2 c e 3 4 c we then define the vector fields 3 5 wze e t z e z e the following lemma is proved in 7 inf sup stability of cubic lagrange stokes elements 7 lemma 3 let z sh and e eh z with e z y and denote the two triangles that have e as an edge as t 1 and t 2 let w z e be given by 3 5 then wze v 3 h 00 z 3 6 a supp wze t 1 t 2 and div w z e ts z 1 for s 1 2 3 6 b wze l t 1 t 2 c 3 6 c the constant c only depends on the shape regularity of t 1 and t 2 3 1 schematic for interior vertex it will be useful to use the following notation for an interior vertex z s inth we assume that th z t 1 t 2 tn enumerated as before so that tj tj 1 share an edge for j 0 n 1 and we identify t 0 as tn indices modulo n for 1 i n we let ei be the edge shared by ti and ti 1 and en is the edge shared by tn and t 1 we let y 1 y 2 yn be the vertices such that ei z yi we set y 0 z also ni is unit normal to ei pointing out of ti and i is the angle formed by the two edges of ti emanating from z moreover let ti be the unit tangent vector to ei pointing towards yi the edge opposite to z belonging to ti is denoted by fi the unit normal to fi pointing out of ti is denoted mi 3 7 mi fi 1 yi yi 1 yi yi 1 1 yi yi 1 finally hi dist z fi the notation denotes rotation by 90 degrees counter clockwise see figure 3 for an illustration using this notation we will use the shorthand notation i yi for 0 i n and wi w z ei for 1 i n 3 2 singular vertices are local interpolating vertices s 2 h lh in this section we recall that all singular vertices are local interpolating vertices the proof can be found in 7 but we recall some of the details lemma 4 it holds s 2 h lh moreover there exists a constant csing such that dz csing for all z s 2 h where csing only depends on the shape regularity of the mesh proof we only consider interior singular vertices for simplicity the proof for boundary singular vertices is similar suppose that z s 2 inth and we use the notation in section 3 1 note that n 4 let a a 1 a 4 w z first define b 1 a 1 and inductively define bj aj bj 1 for j 2 3 then define v b 1 w 1 b 2 w 2 b 3 w 3 by 3 6 a v v 3 h 00 z using 3 6 b we see that div v tj z aj for 1 j 3 we also have div v t 4 z b 3 a 3 a 2 a 1 a 4 where we used that a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 w z moreover using 3 6 c we have v l h z c b 1 b 2 b 3 c max 1 j 4 aj 8 j guzma n and r scott figure 3 example of th z with n 4 where the constant c only depends on the shape regularity constant 3 3 interior vertices with odd number of triangles are local interpolating vertices in this section we prove that if z s inth and th z has an odd number of triangles then z lh lemma 5 let z s inth with th z t 1 tn and suppose that n is odd then z lh moreover there exists a constant codd such that dz codd here codd is a fixed constant that only depends on the shape regularity of the mesh proof we use the notation in section 3 1 we start by defining some auxiliary functions first define v 1 1 2 n j 1 1 j 1 wj we see that v 1 v 3 h 00 z by 3 6 a moreover using 3 6 b we see that div v 1 tj z 1 j for 1 j n where ij is the kronecker delta function note that here we used crucially that n is odd moreover we have by 3 6 c that v 1 l h z c inf sup stability of cubic lagrange stokes elements 9 where c only depends on the shape regularity next we define inductively vi wi vi 1 for 2 i n then we easily see that vi v 3 h 00 z and 3 8 div vi tj z ij for 1 i j n and furthermore 3 9 vi l h z c for 1 i j n where c only depends on the shape regularity now given a a 1 an w z we set v n j 1 ajvj then using 3 8 we get 3 1 moreover using 3 9 we get v l h z codd max 1 j n aj where codd is a fixed constant only depending on the shape regularity of the mesh 3 4 interior vertices with even number of triangles if z s inth is non singular and has an even number of triangles containing it then it is not necessarily the case that z lh in this section we give sufficient conditions for z lh we use the notation in section 3 1 to do this in addition to the vector fields wi we will need other vector fields we start with 3 10 i 12 ei zeini 12 ei 2 z yini for 1 i n in the following lemma the indices are calculated modulo n lemma 6 it holds for 1 i n supp i ti ti 1 3 11 a div i yj 0 for 1 j n 3 11 b div i ti z 12 cot i ei 2 div i ti 1 z 12 cot i 1 ei 2 3 11 c ti div i dx 1 ti 1 div i dx 1 3 11 d i l ti ti 1 c ei 2 3 11 e proof it follows from the definition 3 3 of zei that 3 11 a and 3 11 b hold a simple calcu lation using 2 6 and 2 7 shows that yi ti 1 sin i ei ni 1 thus div i ti z 12 ei 2 z z yi ti ni 12 sin i ei 2 ni 1 ni 12 cot i ei 2 10 j guzma n and r scott similarly we can show that div i ti 1 z 12 cot i 1 ei 2 to show 3 11 d we use integration by parts and use that zei vanishes on ti ei to get ti div i dx 12 ei ei ds 1 similarly we can show that ti 1 div i dx 1 to prove 3 11 e we use the definition of i and the bound 3 4 c note that i is not in v 3 h 0 z by 3 11 d however again using 3 11 d we see that 1 2 n does belong to v 3 h 0 z in fact using 3 11 b we have that v 3 h 00 z we collect it in the following result lemma 7 it holds that v 3 h 00 z and div tj z 12 cot j 1 ej 2 1 ej 1 2 for 1 j n 3 12 l h z c h 2 z 3 13 the inequality 3 13 follows from 3 11 e so far we have w 1 wn and that belong to v 3 h 00 z next we describe two more functions that also belong to the space we let e 1 1 0 t and e 2 0 1 t be canonical directions we then define i 2 zei for i 1 2 the following result can easily be proven lemma 8 it holds for i 1 2 i v 3 h z 3 14 a div i yj 0 for 1 j n 3 14 b div i tj z 3 tj bji for 1 j n 3 14 c tj div i dx bji for 1 j n 3 14 d where tj denotes the area of tj and using 3 7 we get 3 15 bji fj mj ei 3 yj yj 1 ei 3 yj yj 1 e i 3 inf sup stability of cubic lagrange stokes elements 11 where v denotes the rotation of v by 90 degrees counter clockwise moreover the following bound holds 3 16 i l h z c hz proof from the definition z we have that 3 14 a and 3 14 b hold to show 3 14 c we have div i tj z 2 z z z tj ei 2 mj ei hj fj mj ei tj in the last equation we used that tj hj fj 2 using that div i is linear in tj and 3 14 b 3 14 c we have tj div i dx tj 3 div i tj z bji finally 3 16 follows by a simple computation we note that i does not belong to v 3 h 0 z by 3 14 d however by integration by parts and using that i vanishes on h z we do have that h z div idx 0 and hence 3 17 b 1 i b 2 i bni 0 for i 1 2 this also follows by summing 3 15 we can now correct i to make it belong to v 3 h 00 z we define i i c 1 i 1 c 2 i 2 cn 1 i n 1 for i 1 2 where cji b 1 i b 2 i bji 1 3 yn yj e i for j 1 n in the following result indices are calculated mod n and in particular c 0 i cn i 0 lemma 9 it holds for i 1 2 i v 3 h 00 z and div i tj z 3 tj bji 12 cot j cji ej 2 cj 1 i ej 1 2 for 1 j n 3 18 i l h z c hz 3 19 the bound 3 19 follows from 3 16 and 3 11 e we define for i 1 2 3 20 dji div i tj z 3 tj bji 12 cot j cji ej 2 cj 1 i ej 1 2 for 1 j n and 3 21 dj 0 div tj z cot j 1 ej 2 1 ej 1 2 for 1 j n using 3 19 and 3 13 we note that for all 1 j n 3 22 dji c hsz where s 1 if i 1 2 and s 2 if i 0 12 j guzma n and r scott we can now prove the following important result lemma 10 let z s 1 inth with th z t 1 tn with n even assume that for at least one i 0 1 2 3 23 di n j 1 1 jdji 6 0 then z lh moreover in this case there exists a constant c depending only on the shape regularity constant such that 3 24 dz c max 0 i 2 1 1 di hsz where s 1 if i 1 2 and s 2 if i 0 proof we set 0 let i be such that 3 23 holds we let s 1 0 and define inductively sj dji sj 1 for 2 j n define v 1 1 di i s 2 w 2 sn 1 wn 1 snwn we easily have that using 3 20 3 21 div v 1 tj z 1 di dji sj 1 sj 0 for 2 j n and div v 1 t 1 z 1 di d 1 i sn we see that sn n j 2 1 jdji we have d 1 i sn n j 1 1 jdji di hence div v 1 t 1 z 1 the following bound follows from 3 22 3 19 3 13 and 3 6 c 3 25 v 1 l h z c di hsz then we define inductively v w v 1 for 2 n we then easily see that 3 26 div v tj z j for 1 j n moreover from 3 6 c and 3 25 we have v l h z c 1 1 di hsz for an arbitrary a a 1 a 2 an w z we simply define v n 1 a v inf sup stability of cubic lagrange stokes elements 13 then v satisfies 3 1 and hence z lh by 3 4 we have v l h z c 1 1 di hsz max a which proves 3 24 3 5 simplification of condition 3 23 in the case i 0 we have d 0 n i 1 1 jdj 0 n i 1 1 j cot j ej 2 ej 1 2 n i 1 1 j cot j cot j 1 ej 2 3 27 thus we see that generically this is nonzero since the lengths ej can be chosen independently of the angles j for i 1 2 we have n j 1 1 j 3 tj bji n j 1 1 j 1 tj yj 1 yj e i n j 1

r scott therefore for i 1 2 di n j 1 1 j 4 cot j cot j 1 ej 2 1 tj 1 tj 1 yj e i 4 d 0 yn e i 3 30 4 meshes where 3 23 fails to hold lemma 10 gives sufficient conditions for an interior vertex z with an even number of triangles to be a local interpolating vertex i e z lh we see that 3 23 is a mild constraint and that a generic vertex will satisfy 3 23 however there are important examples of vertices which do not satisfy 3 23 and perhaps are not local interpolating vertices here we present some examples 4 1 regular n gon with n even suppose that h z is a triangulated regular n gon with n even more precisely we assume that h z is subdivided by n similar triangles with edge lengths e 1 e 2 en and interior angles 1 2 n then we can show that 3 23 does not hold first of all the condition on the edge lengths alone implies that dj 0 0 for all j 1 n thus d 0 0 now consider i 1 2 the vertices of the regular n gon can be written as yk he 2 k n for some h here we make the the standard association e with the vector cos sin t we conclude that for n even 4 1 h 1 n j 1 1 jyj n 2 j 1 e 4 j n n 2 j 1 e 2 2 j 1 n 1 e 2 n n 2 j 1 e 4 k n 0 since all the triangles are the same using 3 30 and that we showed d 0 0 we have for i 1 2 di 8 cot 1 e 1 2 2 t 1 n j 1 1 jyj e i 0 where we used 4 1 thus 3 23 fails for i 1 2 as well and lemma 10 cannot be used 4 2 three lines mesh for the three lines mesh generating a regular hexagonal pattern as shown on the left in figure 4 the condition 3 23 also fails for i 0 1 2 since each vertex is at the center of a regular hexagon 5 crossed triangles consider the mesh shown on the right in figure 4 half of the vertices are at the center of a regular 4 gon but these are singular vertices so these are all local interpolating vertices for the other vertices at the center of a non regular 8 gon we can argue as follows since the interior angles are all the same 4 and cot 4 1 we have using 3 27 inf sup stability of cubic lagrange stokes elements 15 z figure 4 for the mesh on left no interior vertex satisfies 3 23 all interior vertices on the mesh on the right belong to lh 5 1 d 0 2 8 j 1 1 j 1 ej 2 let l be the length of the smallest edge l min ej j 1 8 then the longest edge length is 2 l and the edge lengths ej alternate l 2 l l 2 l thus 8 j 1 1 j 1 ej 2 2 l 2 depending on where we start the counting therefore condition 3 23 holds at these vertices and thus lemma 10 can be applied to conclude that these vertices are also local interpolating vertices thus all of the vertices in the mesh shown on the right in figure 4 are in lh 6 inf sup stability when all interior vertices belong to lh in the previous section we have identified many local interpolating vertices in particular sin gular vertices and interior vertices with odd number of triangles are local interpolating vertices see lemmas 4 and 5 if z is an interior non singular vertex with even number of triangles then lemma 10 gives sufficient conditions for it to be a local interpolating vertex none of the above examples address boundary vertices that are non singular in this section we will show how to interpolate at those vertices but in a non local way then using that result and assuming that s inth lh we will prove inf sup stability in the next section we will address s int h 6 lh for vertices that are not local interpolating vertices we can still interpolate there but with a side effect of polluting a neighboring vertex in other words the vector field will not belong to v 3 h 00 z to do this we will need to define a piecewise cubic function that has average zero on edges for every z s h and interior edge e eh with e z y we set 6 1 ze z e 1 2 z y 2 z y 1 2 z y the function ze will play the same role as z e in 7 but the difference is that the added term in ze is piecewise quadratic let t 1 t 2 th z be two triangles that have e as an edge and let i be the angle between the edges of ti emanating from z 16 j guzma n and r scott then we can easily verify the following supp ze t 1 t 2 6 2 a ze 0 for sh 6 z and 6 y 6 2 b e ze ds 0 6 2 c ze ti z 1 2 y ti z e ti y 1 2 z ti for i 1 2 6 2 d using these functions we can prove the following result lemma 11 for every p q 2 h and z s h there exists a v v 3 h 0 z such the following properties hold div v 0 for all s h 6 z 6 3 a div v t z p t z for all t th z 6 3 b if z is non singular 6 4 v l 2 h z c 1 z 1 p l 2 h z if z is singular 6 5 v l 2 h z c p l 2 h z the constant c only depends only on the shape regularity proof if z is singular the result follows from lemma 4 so now assume that z is non singular enumerate the triangles such that t 1 and tn each have a boundary edge and tj tj 1 share an edge ej z yj for j 1 n 1 let j denote the angle between the edges of tj originating from z also let nj be the normal to ej out of tj and tj be tangent to ej pointing away from z let 1 s n 1 be such that sin s s 1 z we will define vector fields v 1 vn we start by defining vs vs 2 es sin s sin s s 1 ts 1 z es then we can easily show that div vs ti z i s for 1 i n where i s is the kronecker indeed div vs ti z 2 es sin s sin s s 1 ts 1 zes ti z es sin s sin s s 1 ts 1 ys ti z the result follows after using 2 5 and 2 7 to calculate ys ti and using basic trigonometry then we can define inductively for s 1 j n vj w z ej vj 1 also for 1 j s 1 we define vj w z ej vj 1 inf sup stability of cubic lagrange stokes elements 17 hence we have the following property 6 6 div vj ti s i j for 1 i j n we then define v n j 1 p tj z vj the stated conditions on v are easily verified we can then use the above lemma to prove the following result we define min min z s 1 h z lemma 12 for every p q 2 h there exists a v v 3 h 0 such that div v p z 0 for all z s h 6 7 and v l 2 cb 1 min 1 p l 2 the constant cb only depends on the shape regularity proof let p q 2 h for every z s h let v z be the vector field from lemma 11 then we set v z s h vz then it is easy to verify the conditoins on v we can now prove the main result of the section theorem 1 assume that s inth lh then for every p q 2 h there exists a v v 3 h 0 satisfying div v p 0 for all sh 6 8 with the bound v h 1 c 1 d 1 1 min p l 2 where d maxz lh dz proof let v 1 be from lemma 12 and let p 1 p div v 1 and we note that p 1 q 2 h with p 1 vanishing on boundary vertices since s inth lh for every z s int h there exists a v z v 3 h 00 z such that div vz p 1 z 0 with vz l h z dz max t th z p 1 t z using an inverse estimate we can show vz l 2 h z cdz p 1 l 2 h z 18 j guzma n and r scott figure 5 illustration for lemma 13 with n 4 if we set v 2 z sint h vz and set v v 1 v 2 then the desired conditions on v are met using lemma 2 we have the following corollary corollary 1 assume that s inth lh then the inf sup condition holds for q 2 h v 3 h with constants given by lemma 2 and theorem 1 7 inf sup stability the general case as mentioned above for most meshes s inth lh and hence by the previous section one can prove inf sup stability however for very important meshes such as the diagonal mesh none of the interior vertices belong to lh i e lh s inth however if some interior nodes belong to lh then it might hold that div v 3 h q 2 h and we can give a bound for inf sup constant to do this we use a concept of a tree and paths we consider the mesh as a graph and consider trees and paths that are subgraphs of the mesh precise statements are given below 7 1 paths and trees in a mesh we will prove that if there is a tree of the mesh th with root in lh satisfying certain mild conditions then we can interpolate a pressure on all the vertices of the tree we start with some preliminary results let t 1 t 2 th z be two triangles that have e as an edge and let i be the angle between the edges of ti emanating from z then we define 7 1 m ze cot 1 cot 2 note that m ze 0 if 1 2 lemma 13 let z y sh and e z y eh and suppose that m ze 6 0 let th z t 1 t 2 tn and suppose t 1 and t 2 are the two triangles that share e as an edge and let i be the angles of ti originating from y for i 1 2 see figure 5 let a a 1 a 2 an rn inf sup stability of cubic lagrange stokes elements 19 and define the alternating sum s a n j 1 1 j

the constant c depends only on the shape regularity proof we prove the result in the case z is an interior vertex the case z is a boundary vertex is similar we use the notation from section 3 1 we need to define some auxiliary vector fields first let r 2 e 1 ze 1 n 1 where we recall that the definition of ze 1 is given in 6 1 using 6 2 a and 6 2 c it is easy to show that r v 3 h 0 z then using 6 2 b we have div r ti 0 for all sh 6 z 6 y also using 6 2 d 2 6 2 7 we can show that div r t 1 z cot 1 div r t 2 z cot 2 and div r t 1 y cot 1 div r t 2 z cot 2 if we let v 1 1 m ze r cot 2 w 1 then using the properties of w 1 e g 3 6 we have the following div v 1 t 1 z 1 div v 1 t 2 z 0 div v 1 t 1 y cot 1 m ze div v 1 t 2 y cot 2 m ze and v 1 l h z c m ze where the constant c only depends on the shape regularity constant next we define inductively vj wj 1 vj 1 for 2 j n 20 j guzma n and r scott using the properties of v 1 just proved together with 3 6 we can show the following for all 1 j n vj v 3 h 0 z 7 3 a div vj 0 for all sh 6 z 6 y 7 3 b div vj ti z ij for all 1 i j n 7 3 c vj l h z c 1 1 m ze c m ze 7 3 d where we used that m ze c is bounded where the constant c depends on the shape regularity by the definition of vj and using that div wj y 0 we note that div vj y 1 j 1 div v 1 y we now set v n j 1 ajvj we easily see conditions 7 2 hold we can apply the previous result repeatedly to generalize the result for a path definition 7 1 given z y sh p y 0 y 1 yl is a path between y 0 z yl y if ei yi 1 yi eh and yi 6 yj for i 6 j we say that the path is acceptable if m yi 1 ei 6 0 for 1 i l see figure 7 6 for an illustration for an acceptable path p as in definition 7 1 we define for 1 j l 1 z yj m y 1 e 1 m y 0 e 1 m y 2 e 2 m y 1 e 2 m yj ej m yj 1 ej we also let z z 1 moreover we define 7 4 z yj 1 z yj m yj ej 1 finally we let 7 5 p max 1 j l z yj also for any collection of vertices p we define th p t th t th y for some y p we define h p t th p t lemma 14 suppose that z y sh and let th z t 1 t 2 tn let p y 0 y 1 yl with y 0 z yl y be an acceptable path also we denote by k 1 and k 2 the two triangles that share el and i the corresponding angles for every a a 1

here s a n j 1 1 jaj the constant c only depends on the shape regularity of the mesh proof let a a 1 an rn be given we will use the following notation ej is the edge with vertices yj 1 yj we assume that th yj t 1 j t 2 j tnj j and such that t 1 j t 2 j share ej as a common edge the corresponding angles are denoted by 1 j 2 j note that k 1 t 1 l and k 2 t 2 l by lemma 13 we have r 1 v 3 h 0 y 0

7 7 e the next task is to interpolate values on a tree of the mesh we need some notation definition 2 we say that r r y e with y 0 j m yj and e 1 j m ej is a tree of th with root r if the following hold 1 y 0 r 2 for every 1 j m yj sh ej eh and yj ej 3 for every y yj there is a unique e ej such that e y z for some z yj 1 4 yj yi for i 6 j inf sup stability of cubic lagrange stokes elements 23 if y yj and z yj s for s 1 and there is a path in r r connecting y to z then we say that z is a descendant of y and that y is an ancestor of z if we let y 0 z ys y by path we mean pz y y 0 y 1 ys such that yi yj s i for 0 i s such that ei yi 1 yi ej s i 1 for 1 i s we let d y denote the set of all descendants of y and a y to be all the ancestors of y we know that if z y then there is a unique path pz r which we denote by pz from z to the root r we say that the tree r r is acceptable if pz is acceptable for each z y moreover we define 7 11 r r max z y pz where pz is defined in 7 5 we can now state the following result lemma 15 let r r y e with y 0 j m yj and e 1 j m ej be an acceptable tree of th with root r lh then for any p q 2 h there exist v v 3 h 0 such that support v h y 7 12 a div v p 0 for all y 7 12 b div v 0 for all sh y 7 12 c if in addition th is quasi uniform the following bound holds 7 13 v l 2 h y c 1 dr 1 r r r r p l 2 h y where r r 2 maxz y y a z d y we recall that dr is given in 3 2 proof for every z y with z 6 r there is a unique path pz y that connects z to r by lemma 14 we can find vz v 3 h 0 such that support vz h pz 7 14 a div vz p z 0 7 14 b div vz 0 for all sh 6 z 6 r 7 14 c vz l h pz c pz max t th z p t z 7 14 d where c only depends on the shape regularity of the mesh note that from 7 14 d and inverse estimates we get that for any y a z assuming hy c hz which holds if the mesh is quasi uniform we have 7 15 vz l 2 h y c pz p l 2 h z then we take w z y z 6 r vz we then have the following properties of w div w p y 0 for all y y r 7 16 support w h y 7 17 div w 0 y 7 18 24 j guzma n and r scott since r lh using definition 1 we can find r v 3 h 00 r so that 7 19 div r div w p r 0 7 20 r l h r dr max t th r div w p t r in this case using inverse estimates we can show that 7 21 r l 2 h r cdr w l 2 h r p l 2 h r we next set v w r and we see that v v 3 h 0 and 7 12 a 7 12 b and 7 12 c hold to get the bound 7 13 we assume that th is quasi uniform using the triangle inequality and 7 21 v l 2 h y w l 2 h y r l 2 h y 1 c dr w l 2 h y p l 2 h r next we estimate w w 2 l 2 h y y y w 2 l 2 h y y y z d y vz 2 l 2 h y by 7 14 a y y z d y vz l 2 h y 2 by the triangle inequality y y d y z d y vz 2 l 2 h y by ho lder s inequality c r r 2 y y d y z d y p 2 l 2 h z by 7 15 c r r 2 z y p 2 l 2 h z y a z d y interchange summation 3 c r r 2 r r 2 p 2 l 2 h y by definition of r r taking square roots we get w l 2 h y c r r r r p l 2 h y the result now follows the next result follows immediately from the previous lemma theorem 2 suppose that we have r 1 rt lh and corresponding acceptable trees r r 1 r r 2 r rt if r ri zi ei we require that t i 1 zi sh and zi zj for i 6 j then for any p q 2 h there exist v v 3 h 0 such that div v p 0 for all sh inf sup stability of cubic lagrange stokes elements 25 and if th is quasi uniform v l 2 c 1 d 1 p l 2 where 7 22 d max 1 i t dri max 1 i t r ri max 1 i t r ri using theorem 2 and lemma 2 we have that the inf sup condition 2 3 holds for q 2 h v 3 h corollary 2 assuming the hypothesis theorem 2 then the estimate 2 3 holds for q 2 h v 3 h with constants given by lemma 2 and theorem 2 from theorem 2 and lemma 2 we deduce that if the hypotheses of theorem 2 hold then q 2 h v 3 h is inf sup stable see corollary 2 and in fact that div v 3 h q 2 h if we do not care about the inf sup constant in 2 3 and only care if div v 3 h q 2 h then we can give weaker conditions inspecting the proof of lemma 15 and using lemma 2 we can show the following theorem 3 if for every z sh there is exists an r lh such that there is an acceptable path pz r between them then div v 3 h q 2 h 8 relationship to qin s result results concerning the pair of spaces v kh q k 1 h were given in 11 for k 3 here we review the case k 3 for the case k 1 also see 12 and for the case k 2 see 3 qin considered the mesh in figure 10 which is called a type i triangulation 8 of course the upper left and lower right triangles are problematic since the pressures will vanish at the corner vertices there but more interestingly qin found an additional spurious pressure mode as indicated in figure 7 a we can relate this to the quantities di in 3 23 by computing them for this mesh as indicated in figure 7 b there are only two angles in this mesh 4 and 2 and cot 4 1 and cot 2 0 similarly the edge lengths are l and l 2 for some l thus the quantities dj 0 in 3 21 are of the form a where a 1 2 l 2 for the 4 angles and 0 for the 2 angles as indicated in figure 7 b computing the alternating sum of terms in 3 21 we get 8 1 d 0 6 j 1 1 jdj 0 a a 0 a a 0 thus condition 3 23 is violated for i 0 for all the interior vertices in figure 10 now let us compute di for i 1 2 first we note that the sequence of vertices yk for a fixed interior vertex z y 1 l 1 0 z y 2 l 1 1 z y 3 l 0 1 z y 4 l 1 0 z y 5 l 1 1 z y 6 l 0 1 z thus 8 2 6 j 1 1 jyj l 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 z 6 j 1 1 j 0 26 j guzma n and r scott a 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 b a a 0 0 a a figure 7 a a global spurious pressure mode on the mesh in figure 10 b compu tation of 8 1 letting tj cot j cot j 1 we easily can show t 1 1 t 2 2 t 3 1 t 4 1 t 5 2 t 6 1 also we have the sequence of values ej 2 are e 1 2 1 l 2 e 2 2 1 2 l 2 e 3 2 1 l 2 e 4 2 1 l 2 e 5 2 1 2 l 2 e 6 2 1 l 2 hence cot j cot j 1 ej 2 1 l 2 for all j also tj t 1 for all j hence using 3 30 8 1 and 8 2 we have for i 1 2 di 4 l 2 2 t 1 n j 1 1 jyj e i 0 thus condtion 3 23 is violated for all i 0 1 2 for all interior vertices in figure 10 this suggests that the constraint 3 23 maybe required for inf sup stability 9 strang s dimension for simplicity let us assume that is simply connected then the space z 3 h v v 3 h div v 0 is the curl of the space s 4 h of c 1 piecewise quartics on the same mesh where the quartics must vanish to second order on the boundary the dimension of the space s 4 h of c 1 piecewise quartics without boundary conditions is known 10 1 for a broad class of triangulations th to be 9 1 dim s 4 h e 4 v v 0 i where t is the number of triangles in th e resp e 0 is the number of edges resp interior edges in th v resp v 0 is the number of vertices resp interior vertices in th and i is the number of singular interior vertices in th the dimension formula 9 1 is essentially the one conjectured by gil strang 15 so we refer to this as the strang dimension of s 4 h 9 2 d s 4 h e 4 v v 0 i for c 1 piecewise polynomials of degree k 5 the strang dimension was confirmed using an explicit basis 9 but the strang dimension has not yet been confirmed for arbitrary meshes for inf sup stability of cubic lagrange stokes elements 27 a b figure 8 a nodal basis for quartics b nodes that determine value and gradient on an edge k 4 however what is known is that it provides a lower bound 10 9 3 dim s 4 h d s 4 h 9 1 computing dims 4 h now let us compute dims 4 h dim z 3 h under the assumption that the inf sup condition holds the space v 3 h can be described in terms of lagrange nodes 9 4 dim v 3 h 2 t 2 e 0 v 0 2 t 4 e 0 2 v 0 we have v 3 h q 2 h where the latter space consists of mean zero piecewise quadratics that satisfy the alternating condition azh div v 0 at singular vertices where a z h is defined in 2 2 dimq 2 h 6 t 1 thus dim v 3 h dimq 2 h k for some integer k 0 and v 3 h q 2 h if and only if k 0 since dim v 3 h dim image v 3 h dim z 3 h we have dim z 3 h dim v 3 h dim image v 3 h 2 t 4 e 0 2 v 0 6 t 1 k 4 t 4 e 0 2 v 0 1 k 9 5 we have 3 t e e 0 2 e 0 e e 0 thus 9 6 dim z 3 h t e e 0 4 e 0 2 v 0 1 k by euler s formula 1 t e v t e 0 v 0 1 thus e 0 v 0 t 1 and dims 4 h dim z 3 h v 0 e 0 e e 0 4 e 0 2 v 0 k 2 e 0 e 3 v 0 k 9 7 technically we actually have dims 4 h min 0 2 e 0 e 3 v 0 k since the dimension can never be negative there are cases where the number of boundary edges e e 0 which is the same as the number of boundary vertices is larger than e 0 3 v 0 for a domain consisting of only two triangles e 0 1 v 0 0 2 and e e 0 4 so the formula in 9 7 gives a negative number if k 0 from now on we assume that e 0 e e 0 3 v 0 0 for th 28 j guzma n and r scott theorem 4 let k 3 and suppose that th is any triangulation satisfying e 0 3 v 0 e e 0 then v 3 h q 2 h if and only if dims 4 h 2 e 0 e 3 v 0 more generally dim v 3 h dimq 2 h k if and only if dims 4 h 2 e 0 e 3 v 0 k 9 2 computing dim s 4 h now let us relate the spaces s 4 h and s 4 h by imposing boundary con ditions on s 4 h to yield the space s 4 h using the approach pioneered by strang 15 it is natural to conjecture that this involves simply imposing constraints on the boundary for example a c 1 piecewise quartic that vanishes to second order on must vanish to second order at each boundary vertex 3 constraints per boundary vertex in addition the value at one point on each boundary edge must vanish as well as the normal derivative at two points on each boundary edge to see why this is the right number of constraints we pick special nodal variables for quartics as indicated in figure 8 a these are 1 the value and gradient at each vertex 2 the value at edge midpoints and 3 the second order cross derivatives ei ej evaluated at the vertex ij at the intersection of ei and ej where the ek s are the edges of the triangle more precisely ei ij is defined as the directional derivative of in the direction of ei away from ij these nodal variables are unisolvent for quartics as follows vanishing of nodal variables of type 1 and 2 guarantee vanishing on each edge these are the standard nodal variables for hermite quartics thus a quartic q with these nodal values zero is of the form q l 1 l 2 l 3 l where the non trivial linear functions li vanish on ei but ei ejq ij eilj ejli lk ij l ij where i j k 1 2 3 and lk ij 6 0 thus vanishing of the nodal variables of type 3 implies that l 0 moreover similar arguments show that the nodal variables for q associated with a boundary edge as indicated in figure 8 b determine q to second order on that edge thus satisfication of second order boundary conditions is guarenteed by setting these nodal values to zero this reduces the dimension by at most 3 v v 0 3 e e 0 6 e e 0 since e e 0 v v 0 we will show that these conditions have at least one redundancy at singular boundary vertices thus dims 4 h dim s 4 h 6 e e 0 b where b is the number of singular boundary vertices therefore 9 8 dims 4 h 6 e e 0 b dim s 4 h d s 4 h e 4 v v 0 i inf sup stability of cubic lagrange stokes elements 29 a 2 e e e 1 3 b 2 e e 1 e e 3 4 figure 9 a singular boundary vertex where two triangles meet b singular bound ary vertex where three triangles meet assume now that v 3 h q 2 h using theorem 4 and e e 0 v v 0 we find dims 4 h 6 e e 0 b e 0 e e 0 3 v 0 6 e e 0 b e 0 3 v 0 i 5 e e 0 e 0 3 v i 2 e e 0 e 3 v i e e 0 e 4 v i v 0 9 9 combining 9 8 and 9 9 proves the following result theorem 5 let k 3 and suppose that th is a triangulation satisfying e 0 3 v 0 e e 0 and suppose that v 3 h q 2 h on this triangulation then the strang dimension 9 1 is valid for s 4 h dim s 4 h d s 4 h moreover equality holds in 9 8 so the 6 e e 0 b constraints are nonredundant to complete the proof of theorem 5 we need to verify the redundancy of constraints at singular boundary vertices this occurs because the second order cross derivatives ei ej are linearly dependent at singular boundary vertices for the case of a triangle with two boundary edges e 1 and e 2 the vanishing of the nodal variables of type 1 and 2 on e 1 and e 2 already imply vanishing on both edges so necessarily e 1 e 2 is already zero for the case where two triangles meet at a singular boundary vertex see figure 9 a then e 1 and e 3 are parallel and thus 9 10 e 1 e 2 e 3 e 2 for any c 1 piecewise quartic thus setting one of them to zero sets the other they are redundant for the case where three triangles meet at a singular boundary vertex see figure 9 b equation 9 10 still holds and in addition e 2 and e 4 are parallel and thus e 3 e 2 e 3 e 4 for any c 1 piecewise quartic thus e 1 e 2 e 3 e 4 and setting one of them to zero sets the other they are redundant this completes the proof of theorem 5 30 j guzma n and r scott figure 10 the type i regular mesh studied in 11 chapter 6 since theorem 2 allows us to prove the inf sup condition for quite general meshes this confirms the strang dimension 9 1 for s 4 h is correct for such meshes in particular if the hypothesis of theorem 3 holds then 9 1 is correct 9 3 connection to qin s results there is a connection between qin s results and dimension counting qin finds a spurious mode that suggests that div v 3 h 6 q 2 h on the right traingle mesh in figure 10 we conclude that the dimension of the space s 4 h of c 1 quartics satisfying second order boundary conditions on this mesh is at least one larger than the dimension for this space given in theorem 4 k 1 on the other hand it is well known 8 10 that the strang dimension 9 1 is correct on type i triangulations without boundary conditions in view of 9 8 there is a further redundancy in the constraints enforcing boundary conditions unfortunately the dimension of splines in two dimensions satisfying boundary conditions has had only limited study 6 2 so far references 1 p alfeld b piper and l l schumaker an explicit basis for c 1 quartic bivariate splines
