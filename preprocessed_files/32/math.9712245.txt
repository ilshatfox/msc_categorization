i universite paul sabatier abstract given a finite sequence a a 1 an in a domain c n and complex scalars v v 1 vn consider the classical extremal problem of finding the smallest uniform norm of a holomorphic function verifying f aj vj for all j we show that the modulus of the solutions to this problem must approach its least upper bound along a subset of the boundary of the domain large enough to contain the support of a measure whose hull contains a subset of the original a large enough to force the same minimum norm furthermore all the solutions must agree on a variety which also contains this hull an example is given to show that the inclusions can be strict 0 introduction and statement of results given a finite sequence a a 1 an in a domain cn and complex scalars v v 1 vn consider the classical extremal problem 1 inf f f h f aj vj 1 j n m it will be convenient to consider the data v as lying in h ia where h is the algebra of functions holomorphic and bounded on and ia is the ideal associated to a ia f h f aj 0 j 1 n then m v h ia by the definition of the quotient norm by montel s theorem we know that this problem always admits an extremal function f i e a representative of the class v such that f v h ia when n 1 and d it is a classical fact that f is unique and indeed given by a constant multiple of a blaschke product of degree n 1 in particular it is holomorphic in a neighborhood of d and of constant modulus on d and the same properties hold when d is replaced by any bounded domain with smooth boundary in the complex plane and in even more general one dimensional cases see gr or for instance gm and references therein part of this work was done during a stay at the centre de recerca mathema tica universitat auto noma de barcelona bellaterra financed by a program of the comunitat de treball dels pirineus typeset by ams tex 1 http arxiv org abs math 9712245 v 1 2 eric amar and pascal j thomas those properties cannot hold in higher dimension consider the simple example where a 0 d 0 bn the unit ball of cn with 1 n d then given any solution f h bn to the problem 1 the function f 0 h d defined by restriction f 0 f 0 will be a solution to the classical extremal problem in the disk therefore v h bn ia v h d i but given any solution f 0 to the problem in the disk the trivial extension f z f 0 z 1 will solve the problem in the ball thus v h bn ia v h d i f 0 and we have a solution given by a constant multiple of a blaschke product in z 1 which has modulus v h bn ia on d 0 and strictly less than v h bn ia elsewhere on bn furthermore this solution is not unique indeed using for instance the fact that on the unit circle f 0 2 can only have critical points where f 0 vanishes so that in this case the non vanishing of any further derivative at that point would imply a local violation of the maximum principle one sees easily that f 0 does not vanish anywhere on the circle and thus there exists a 0 such that f 0 f 0 1 2 for all d on the other hand if z 1 z bn c cn 1 then z 2 1 z 2 therefore any function of the form g z 1 z f 0 z 1 h z where h z z 2 will provide another solution to the problem we are interested in the relationship between our extremal problem notably the sequence a and the subsets of where its solutions reach their maximum modulus v h ia definition for any function f h let m f lim sup z z f z f it will be useful to highlight those subproblems of the original problem which yield the same extremal norm definition we say that a defines a sufficient subproblem of 1 if and only if v h ia v h ia we say that a problem a v is minimal when it does not contain any strictly smaller sufficient subproblem note that this definition depends on the values v that a be sufficient implies of course that the points of a a are inactive constraints in the sense that removing them will not change the extremum we are looking for note however that the converse is not true it is quite possible to have problems a v every constraint ai vi of which is inactive but of course removing them all resp all but one would lead to a problem without constraints whose solution is resp the modulus of the remaining vj take for instance three points in the disk and values at those three points of a mo bius automorphism of the disk then any pair of points will provide a minimal sufficient subproblem we denote by a the algebra of functions holomorphic on and continuous on for any compact set k the a hull is defined to be k a z cn f a f z max k f in the case where has a neighborhood basis of runge domains for instance when is convex then we can replace a by cn z the set of all holomorphic polynomials in n variables and we just get the polynomial hull denoted by k finite interpolation with minimum uniform norm in cn 3 we will restrict attention to open sets where bounded holomorphic functions are well approximated by functions continuous up to the boundary in the following sense definition we say that has property a if and only if is a bounded domain and for any g h there exists a sequence gn a such that for any open set u limn gn l u g l u and gn g uniformly on compacta of this property holds in particular when is convex and bounded use dilations theorem 1 suppose that has property a let f h and f v h ia there exists a sufficient subproblem a v a such that m f a a in particular if all the points of a are active constraints then m f a a and in general m f a a 6 notice that it follows from the maximum principle that when v is not constant a subsequence a giving a sufficient subproblem must contain at least two points in the case of the example given above m f d 0 and m f d 0 in fact there is always a single setm f 0 contained in all the m f for any f solution to the problem lemma 2 given any a and v as above there exists a holomorphic solution f 0 to the problem 1 such that m f 0 f h f a v f v h ia m f in the case of the example m f 0 d 0 theorem 1 says that m f 0 cannot be too small we give some well known consequences in the case when bn corollary 3 1 the set m f 0 has positive possibly infinite length 2 the set m f 0 cannot be a peak interpolation set 3 if m f 0 d 0 then m f 0 d 0 proof by applying an automorphism of the ball we may assume that 0 m f 0 a then fo and la show that the length of m f 0 is at least 2 so remains pos itive after applying the inverse automorphism for ii see ru iii is elementary representing measures let be a borel measure on we define the hull of e by z e if and only if there exists a measure z absolutely continuous with respect to which is a representing measure for z i e for any f a f z fd z lemma 4 if is supported on the closed set k that is if k 0 then e k a proof for any z e the measure z given by the above definition is also sup ported on k for any f a f z f d z k f d z sup k f sup k f 4 eric amar and pascal j thomas with the help of the above lemma theorem 1 is a consequence of the following result theorem 5 let f 0 be a solution to the extremal problem 1 there exists a giving a sufficient subproblem of a v and a borel measure on supported on m f 0 such that a e the second named author would like to thank makhlouf derridj norman lev enberg and zbigniew slodkowski for useful discussions 1 proof of theorem 5 the methods needed to prove theorem 5 rely on concepts developed long ago by the first named author am 1 and recently put to use to study pick nevanlinna problems in several variables am 2 first we reduce ourselves to a when needed we will write ja ia a lemma 6 for any finite sequence a and values v v h ia v a ja proof take any f h such that f aj vj 1 j n and f v h ia if fn is the sequence given by property a supa f fn 0 as n let ln be the lagrange polynomial interpolating the values f fn aj at the points aj then fn ln provide representatives of the class of f i e fn ln f ia and fn ln f so v a ja v h ia and the reverse inequality is trivial now to avoid trivialities suppose that v 6 0 and let g be a representative of v in a then by hahn banach s theorem there exists a ja a continuous linear form such that v v a ja and 1 equivalently we may consider that a ia 0 g v a ja and 1 since a can be considered as a subspace of c there is a measure on which represents with 1 write d d where is a probability measure and 1 a e proposition 7 let f 0 h be a solution of the problem 1 and m v h ia v a ja then there exists f l defined almost every where such that f m almost everywhere and f m m f 0 notice that we do not prove that f represents the boundary values of f 0 proof take a sequence fn fn ln as in the proof of lemma 6 by weak com pactness of the unit ball of l fn admits a subsequence which converges weakly to some f l f m furthermore f d lim n fn d lim n fn g m so we must have f m for a e this proves the first assertion about f and reduces the second one to proving that is supported on the closed set m f let m f and c 0 1 such that supp b r m f 1 on b r 2 then by definition of m f there exists 0 such that max b r f m 2 finite interpolation with minimum uniform norm in cn 5 for n large enough by property a maxb r fn m so fn d m d thus f d m d which implies d 0 thus b r 2 0 q e d a representation of h 2 let h 2 be the closure in l 2 of a let b then jb h 2 let eb j b h 2 observe that dim j b 1 for all f a f eb f b 1 eb so either jb is dense in h 2 and eb 0 or if we can find some eb 6 0 kb 1 eb 1 eb is a reproducing kernel for the point b this proves the following lemma 8 if j b 6 0 then b e definition for any f a we let f be the antilinear map from h 2 to itself given by f h k h fk for any h k h 2 lemma 9 see am 2 is an antilinear representation of a and f f if eb j b f eb f b eb now for s let es span eb eb j b b s j s and s denote the restriction of to es the above definitions could be made for any measure but here we will be using the fact that the construction of depended on a solution of the problem 1 proposition 10 for any g a representing the given values v a ja a g g a ja g a ja where a aj a j aj 6 0 proof observe first to avoid trivialities that a cannot be empty otherwise ea would be reduced to 0 and ia would be dense in h which is impossible when v 6 0 because then we d have solutions of the problem 1 with arbitrarily small norm by the definition of a ea ea thus a a applying this to the same function g we get the same operator norms so it will be enough to prove the first equality to complete the proof let f be any function in a h ja since the map only depends on the values of f on a a f h a f thus a f op a f h op f h op f h and passing to the infimum we get a f op f a ja so a g op m 6 eric amar and pascal j thomas conversely given g take f as in proposition 7 again denote m v a ja then since f is obtained as a limit of holomorphic functions f h h 2 and f h 2 m because its modulus is constant a e for any h ja h f hf d hm d m hd m h 0 by definition of thus f j a ea we can then test a g on f a g f 1 f g m g m 2 this proves the required inequality end of proof of theorem 5 by proposition 10 the subproblem defined by a is sufficient proposition 7 shows that the measure defined after lemma 6 is sup ported on f m m f 0 and by lemma 8 the a we have obtained is included in e 2 questions of uniqueness definition the uniqueness variety for the problem 1 is defined by u a v z bn f g solving 1 f g z 0 clearly u a v is an analytic variety containing a proposition 11 whenever is chosen as in theorem 5 e u a v proof we reuse the notations of lemma 6 and proposition 7 suppose f 0 and f 0 are distinct solutions to the problem 1 take two sequences of functions in a fn resp f n converging uniformly on compacta of to f 0 resp f 0 and in l to f resp f the proof of proposition 7 shows that in fact f f a e suppose b e then denoting by b a representing measure for b that is absolutely continuous with respect to f 0 b f 0 b lim n fn f n d b 0 by the dominated convergence theorem examples in the case of the example given in the introduction u a v d 0 b 2 we shall see presently that there are some cases when u a v that is to say the solution to the problem 1 is unique theorem 12 for b 2 there exists a a 1 a 4 and v such that m f 0 is a 2 real dimensional torus in b 2 and the solution to the problem 1 is unique the above theorem will reduce to a result about extension of inner functions from an analytic disk embedded into the ball b 2 first we need a simple one variable lemma finite interpolation with minimum uniform norm in cn 7 lemma 13 let a a 1 an be distinct points in d and bn 1 a blaschke product of degree exactly equal to n 1 let vj bn 1 aj 1 j n then bn 1 is the unique solution to the extremal problem 1 proof it will be enough to show that v h d ia 1 the proof will proceed by induction for n 1 bn 1 is a unimodular constant and the property is obvious suppose it is true for n and consider a a 1 an an 1 for any d denote by the involutive automorphism of d which exchanges 0 and suppose f h d f a v and f 1 let g bn an f an we have g 0 0 so g h with h g 1 set a j an aj v j bn an bn aj 1 j n 1 we have v j b a j 1 j n 1 where b bn an bn an this implies that b bn 1 where bn 1 is a blaschke product of degree n 1 exactly now letting v j v j a j 1 j n we have v j bn 1 a j and v h d ia h 1 a contradiction with the inductive hypothesis from now on we are considering the disk embedded in the unit ball b 2 of c 2 given by d d where 1 2 2 observe that d z 1 z 2 bn z 2 2 z 21 lemma 14 suppose that g h d is an inner function i e g ei 1 for all r analytic in a neighborhood of the closed unit disk such that there exists g h b 2 with g g for all d and g g 1 then g 0 0 and if we write g h there exists h holomorphic in b 2 such that g z 1 z 2 g 2 z 1 z 2 2 z 21 2 3 h 2 z 1 z 2 2 z 21 2 h z 1 z 2 proof step 1 claim for any differentiable function f on the ball set lf z z 1 f 2 z 1 z 2 f z then for any d lg 0 this is to be compared with ru theorem 11 4 7 if g was assumed to be smooth in a neighborhood of b 2 it would be enough to notice that for each z d b 2 l is a derivation along the complex tangent line to b 2 at z since g is maximal on d with respect to b 2 its derivative lg should vanish there the slightly more intricate argument that follows merely extends this to the case where g 1 notice first that since g is smooth across the unit circle its derivative is bounded in a neighborhood of it and we have c 1 0 such that 1 g 2 c 1 1 2 for all d now consider the complex line l passing through the point 0 and 8 eric amar and pascal j thomas parallel to the vector 1 0 since when 0 1 this is the complex tangent to b 2 at 0 there exists a c 2 0 such that the disk of center 0 of radius c 2 1 0 2 1 2 along the line l is contained in b 2 then the function f g 0 c 2 1 0 2 1 2 1 0 is bounded by 1 in modulus on the unit disk and schwarz pick s lemma see gr chap i lemma 1 2 shows that f 0 1 f 0 2 1 g 0 2 1 g 0 2 c 1 1 0 2 and since f 0 c 2 1 0 2 1 2 lg 0 notice that along d z 1 2 we have lg 0 c 1 0 2 1 2 now lg is a holomorphic function on d so it must be identically zero which proves the claim step 2 consider the change of variables w 1 z 1 w 2 z 2 2 z 21 z 1 w 1 z 2 w 2 2 w 21 if we set g 1 w 1 w 2 g z 1 z 2 we then have l 1 g 1 w 1 0 0 where l 1 g 1 w w 1 g 1 3 2 w 1 w 2 g 1 w since g 1 w 1 0 g 2 w 1 we have w 1 g 1 w 1 0 2 g 2 w 1 and the above partial differential equation becomes 2 g 3 w 2 g 1 2 0 which can be solved if and only if g h we then have w 2 g 1 w 1 0 2 3 h 2 w 1 and this provides the expansion of order 1 of g 1 near w 2 0 so g 1 w 1 w 2 g 2 w 1 w 2 2 3 h 2 w 1 w 2 2 h 1 w 1 w 2 for some h holomorphic on the image of b 2 under the change of variables going back to the z 1 z 2 variables we get the lemma we now make a small aside to look into the problem of extending a family of simple functions the monomials k from the analytic disk d to b 2 with the smallest possible h norm lemma 15 i for any g h b 2 such that g g 2 and this bound is attained by g z 1 z 2 2 z 1 ii for any k 6 1 there exists g k h b 2 such that g k k and g k 1 in particular one can take g 2 z 1 z 2 2 3 z 21 2 z 2 g 3 z 1 z 2 2 z 1 z 2 remark finite interpolation with minimum uniform norm in cn 9 we know that the only analytic disks in the ball that allow the uniform norm preserving extension of any bounded holomorphic function are the affine embed dings of d st su this is to be compared with lempert s result that the only disks which admit a holomorphic retraction are geodesic disks for the kobayashi distance i e in this instance affine disks once again le 1 le 2 for our disk d the above lemma gives explicit examples of the functions which do or don t admit norm preserving extensions proof i since g 2 2 2 1 2 z 1 g 0 0 1 applying schwarz s lemma we get supz d g z 0 2 whence the result ii when g 2 g 2 h 2 and setting h 0 we find g 2 checking the norm inequality for z 1 z 2 b 2 is elementary in the same way or by inspection we find g 3 given any integer k 2 we can find two non negative integers a b such that k 2 a 3 b we then set g k g a 2 g b 3 the next result will essentially complete the proof of theorem 12 lemma 16 the function g 3 in lemma 14 is the only g h b 2 such that g 3 and g 1 proof let us first consider the simpler case where g is holomorphic in a neighborhood of the closed ball then so is h the function obtained in lemma 14 for any 0 2 consider the map from the disk to the ball given by 2 ei 2 2 then applying lemma 14 g e i ei e 3 i 1 2 e 4 i ei 1 2 h ei a winding number argument then shows that h must vanish at some point along the curve d we will show that in fact h is identically zero now remove the additional assumption g e i 3 1 1 2 ei 1 2 h set f 1 2 ei 1 2 h this function can only be constant if h 0 suppose this is not the case we claim that for any r 0 1 there exists r 0 2 such that f rei r 0 indeed there exists 0 such that this is true for all r 0 by the open mapping theorem since f 0 0 let r 0 be the largest number such that the conclusion of the claim holds for all r 0 r 0 if r 0 1 since the winding number of the curve f rei around 0 is positive for r small enough and can only change for a value of r at which the curve goes through 0 there must be 0 r 1 r 0 such that f r 1 e i r 1 0 then there is r 2 0 r 1 such that f r 2 ei r 2 is maximal we use the compactness of f d 0 r 1 but this violates the open mapping theorem in a neighborhood of the point r 2 e i r 2 10 eric amar and pascal j thomas by the same argument we can see that the function which to r associates the largest possible value f rei r cannot have a local maximum and that with a slight abuse of notation lim supr 1 f re i r 0 this yields lim sup r 1 g rei r lim sup r 1 r 3 1 f rei r 1 a contradiction thus we must have h 0 q e d end of proof of theorem 12 pick aj j where 1 4 are distinct points in the unit disk and vj 3 j by lemma 12 any solution to the problem 1 must be equal to 3 at the point for any d and v h b 2 ia 1 by lemma 15 v h b 2 ia 1 and by lemma 16 the solution to the problem is unique and assumes its maximum modulus on the set z 1 z 2 1 2 this example shows that the inclusions proved in theorem 1 and proposition 11 can be strict here f 0 z 2 z 1 z 2 u a v b 2 and m f 0 z 1 z 2 1 2 so m f 0 z 1 1 2 z 2 1 2 on the other hand since f 0 a b 2 already we have f f 0 b 2 it is elementary to see that the form can be represented by integration against a function along the boundary of the embedded disk d so we may take 1 2 d and e d so we have the strict inclusions that we had announced finite
