that the cluster value problem in separa ble banach spaces for the banach algebras au and h can be reduced to the cluster value problem in those spaces which are 1 sums of a se quence of finite dimensional spaces in particular we prove that the cluster value problem for 1 is equivalent to the cluster value problem for l 1 0 1 1 introduction the cluster value problem was introduced in 1961 in 3 by a group of math ematicians who worked together under the alias i j schark they compared the set of cluster values of a function f in an algebra h of bounded analytic functions on a domain u at a point z u with the set f mz where mz is the set of multiplicative linear functionals on the algebra h such that l l z for all linear functionals they found these sets are the same when the domain u is the unit disk in the complex plain it was soon un derstood that this cluster value theorem would be a consequence of a positive solution to the famous corona problem which of course was solved positively in the unit disk of the complex plane by carleson in 1962 in 1979 the cluster value problem was solved positively by mcdonald in 7 for bounded analytic functions defined on a strongly pseudoconvex domain with smooth boundary in cn but only in 2012 did aron carando gamelin lasalle and maestre consider the case of domains u in infinite dimensional banach spaces they solved the cluster value problem at the origin for bounded uniformly con tinuous and analytic functions defined on the ball of a banach space with a shrinking 1 unconditional basis in 2 this class of spaces include for exam ple the p spaces for 1 p as well as c 0 but not for example the space 1 or or lp 0 1 1 p 6 2 in 5 we gave a positive answer to the cluster value problem for bounded analytic functions on the ball of the space of continuous functions on a dispersed compact hausdorff space this paper focuses attention on the cluster value problem for the unit ball of the 1 sum of finite dimensional spaces we prove that in order to solve 1991 mathematics subject classification primary 32 xx secondary 46 xx the authors were supported in part by nsf dms 10 01321 1 http arxiv org abs 1307 2195 v 2 2 w b johnson and s ortega castillo the cluster value problem for the unit ball of all separable banach spaces it is enough to solve it for the ball of spaces that are an 1 sum of a sequence of finite dimensional spaces that is if the cluster value problem has a negative solution for some separable banach space then it has a negative answer for some space that is an 1 sum of finite dimensional spaces although we do not see a reduction of the cluster value problem for all banach spaces to the case of separable banach spaces an obvious modification of the proof of theorem 2 4 yields that if the cluster value problem has a positive solution for uncountable 1 sums of all collections of finite dimensional spaces then there is a positive answer for all banach spaces to be precise we recall 5 that the cluster value problem is posed as follows given a banach space x an algebra h of bounded analytic functions over the ball b of x that contains x and a point x in the weak closure of bx that is in the closed unit ball of x we define for f h the set clb f x to be all the limit values of f x over all nets x in bx converging to x in the weak topology and we define mx to be the multiplicative linear functionals in the spectrum over h that when restricted to x coincide with x is it then true that clb f x mx f for every f h the reverse inclusion is always true as we may recall from the first section in 5 the algebras of analytic functions we consider in this paper are h b the set of all bounded analytic functions on the open unit ball b bx of the banach space x and au b the uniformly continuous functions that are in h b 2 reduction of the cluster value problem to 1 sums of finite dimensional spaces we will see that the cluster value problem in banach spaces can be re duced to the cluster value problem in those spaces that are 1 sums of finite dimensional spaces for simplicity we will only show that the cluster value problem for separable spaces can be reduced to the cluster value problem in spaces that are a countable 1 sum of finite dimensional spaces and it will be clear that the nonseparable case reduces to uncountable 1 sums of finite dimensional spaces we will need the next two lemmas the ideas in the following lemmas originated with c stegall 8 and were developed by the first author in 4 lemma 2 1 let y be a separable banach space and y 1 y 2 y 3 an increasing sequence of finite dimensional subspaces whose union is dense in y set x yn 1 then the isometric quotient map q x y defined the cluster value problem for banach spaces 3 by q zn n n 1 zn induces an isometric algebra homomorphism q h by h bx where h denotes either the algebra au or the algebra h proof note that for all zn n x 2 1 q zn n n 1 zn n 1 zn zn n 1 let y n zn n x zk 0 k 6 n since q by n byn for all n n we now have that q bx is dense in by and hence q is an isometric quotient map then the function q h by h bx given by q f f q is an isometric homomorphism because q is clearly linear and for all f h by q f sup x bx f q x sup y by f y f moreover for all f g h by q f g f g q f q g q q f q g so q is an algebra homomorphism lemma 2 2 under the assumptions of lemma 2 1 there is a norm one algebra homomorphism t h bx h by so that t x y and t q ih by proof the first part of the proof consists of constructing t and verifying that th bx h by for every y yn and n n let sn y zi i x be given by zi y if i n and y yn 0 otherwise let u be a free ultrafilter on n for each g h bx set sg y lim n u g sny for every y b yn which is well defined because g is bounded next we prove that sg is contin uous let 0 r 1 since g h bx then schwarz lemma thm 7 19 6 and the convexity of bx imply that g au rbx let 0 since g is uniformly continuous on rbx there exists 0 such that if a b rbx and a b then g a g b thus given y 1 y 2 rb yn such that 4 w b johnson and s ortega castillo y 1 y 2 we can find n n such that y 1 y 2 yn n n and then sn y 1 sn y 2 y 1 y 2 eventually for n so sg y 1 sg y 2 lim n u g sn y 1 g sn y 2 since each sg b yn c is uniformly continuous on rb yn for 0 r 1 we can continuously extend each sg to tg by c moreover it is evident that tg is uniformly continuous on bx when g au bx it is left to show that each tg is analytic by checking that every tg is analytic in each complex line thm 8 7 6 we do this in two parts step 1 let us check that each sg is analytic on complex lines let y 1 b yn and y 2 6 0 yn since b yn is open we can find r 0 such that if y y 1 r then y b yn choose r 0 such that r y 2 r thus if r we have that c y 1 y 2 b yn for each n n let un sn y 1 and wn sn y 2 using the notation in remark 5 2 in 6 we claim that sg y 1 y 2 m 0 lim n u pmg un wn m uniformly on for r let us start by showing that for each m n and 0 r limn u p mg un wn exists we can find s 1 such that also sr y 2 r then when t s and r we have that y 1 t y 2 b yn because y 1 t y 2 y 1 t y 2 sr y 2 r so un t wn bx eventually for n and from cauchy s inequality cor 7 4 6 for each m n pmg un wn 1 sm g eventually for n and then limn u p mg un wn exists the cluster value problem for banach spaces 5 moreover given m n and such that r sg y 1 y 2 m m 0 lim n u pmg un wn m lim n u g un wn m m 0 pmg un wn lim n u m m 1 pmg un wn m m 1 1 sm g g s 1 1 sm which goes to zero as m thus sg is analytic on complex lines step 2 the following general lemma should be known but we could not find a reference lemma 2 3 if by c is bounded and uniformly continuous on sby for each 0 s 1 and there is a dense subspace z of y such that bz is analytic on complex lines then is analytic on complex lines in by and hence analytic proof let y 1 by and y 2 6 0 y let s y 1 1 since sby is open and contains y 1 we can find r 0 such that if y y 1 r then y sby choose r 0 such that r y 2 r thus if r we have that c y 1 y 2 sby let f y 1 y 2 a function defined for r we want to show that f is analytic let y 1 k k bz and y 2 k k z be sequences such that y 1 k y 1 1 2 k and y 2 k y 2 1 2 k choose k 1 n such that 1 r 2 k 1 r r y 2 then for k k 1 and r we have that y 1 k y 2 k y 1 y 1 k y 1 y 2 k y 2 y 2 1 r 2 k 1 r y 2 r so y 1 k y 2 k sbz for each k k 1 let fk y 1 k y 2 k which is an analytic function for r by assumption 6 w b johnson and s ortega castillo since is bounded clearly fk k k 1 is uniformly bounded let us now show that fk k k 1 converges uniformly to f let 0 since is uniformly continuous on sbz we can find 0 such that a b sbz a b a b choose k k 1 such that 1 r 2 k then k k and with r y 1 k y 2 k y 1 y 2 y 1 k y 1 y 2 k y 2 1 r 2 k so fk f y 1 k y 2 k y 1 y 2 then by the lemma on p 226 in 1 f is analytic from the previous two steps we obtain that t is a well defined mapping from h bx into h by now given x x y 1 y 2 by and c such that y 1 y 2 by we can find y 1 k k b yn converging to y 1 and y 2 k k b yn converging to y 2 and then tx y 1 y 2 lim k lim n u x sn y 1 k y 2 k lim k lim n u x sn y 1 k x sn y 2 k tx y 1 tx y 2 i e tx y this shows that tbx by moreover for every f h by and y by we can find yk k b yn converging to y and thus t q f y t f q y lim k lim n u f q sn yk lim k f yk f y so t q ih by the cluster value problem for banach spaces 7 also t is a homomorphism because t is clearly linear and for all f g h bx y by we can find yk k b yn converging to y so t f g y lim k lim n u f g sn yk lim k lim n u f sn yk g sn yk tf y tg y tf tg y finally for every f h bx tf sup y by tf y sup y b yn lim n u f sn y sup x bx f x f and t t q t q 1 so t 1 theorem 2 4 let y be a separable banach space and y 1 y 2 y 3 an increasing sequence of finite dimensional subspaces whose union is dense in y set x yn 1 let h denote either the algebra au or the algebra h if h bx satisfies the cluster value theorem at every x bx then h by satisfies the cluster value theorem at every y by proof we know that f mx bx clbx f x for all f h bx and x bx let us show that g my by clby g y for all g h by and y by let y by my by and g h by let t be the algebra homomorphism from h bx to h by constructed in lemma 2 2 then x y t bx q g h bx and defining t we see that mx bx because for all x x x tx y t x x x moreover q g q g t q g g g and clbx q g x clbx g q x clby g q x clby g y so the theorem is established remark 2 5 a very special case of theorem 2 4 is that if 1 satisfies the cluster value theorem then so does l 1 we do not know for 1 p 6 2 whether the cluster value theorem for p implies the cluster value theorem for lp incidentally in 2 it was proved that p for p in this range satisfies the cluster value theorem at 0 but it is open whether lp satisfies the cluster value theorem at any point of blp 8 w b johnson and s ortega castillo remark 2 6 the analogue of theorem 2 4 for non separable spaces which is proved by a non essential modification of the proof of theorem 2 4 can be stated as follows let y be a banach space and y a a family of finite dimensional subspaces of y that is directed by inclusion and whose union is dense in y if a y 1 satisfies the cluster value theorem then so does y remark 2 7 there is a slight strengthening of theorem 2 4 let y yn n and h be as in the statement of theorem 2 4 and suppose that xn n is a sequence so that xn is 1 n isomorphic to yn and n 0 if n xn 1 satisfies the cluster value theorem for the algebra h then so does y now let zn be a sequence of finite dimensional spaces so that for every finite dimensional space z and every 0 the space z is 1 isomorphic to one and hence infinitely many of the spaces zn set c 1 n zn 1 as an immediate consequence of this slight improvement of theorem 2 4 we get if c 1 satisfies the cluster value theorem for h then so does every separable banach space the proof of the improved theorem 2 4 is essentially the same as the proof of the theorem itself one just needs to define in lemma 2 1 the mapping q so that the conclusion of lemma 2 1 remains true for each n take an isomorphism jn xn yn so that for x xn the inequality 1 n 1 x jnx x is valid and define q xn n n jnxn for xn n in n xn 1 remark 2 8 if every banach space with an unconditional basis satisfies the cluster value theorem for the algebra h then so does every separable banach lattice the proof is basically the same as the previous because a banach lattice is paved by finite dimensional subspaces en n with en en 1 and en has a 1 1 n unconditional basis references 1 lars v ahlfors complex
