holomorphic extension along the complex lines through a boundary point have holomor phic extension to the ball this was proved in 2 by an argument of cr geometry we give here an elementary proof based on the expansion in holomorphic and antiholomorphic powers 1 main result statement and proof in my note 2 i stated a general principle of holomorphic extension from a convex boundary of cn for functions which have separate holomorphic extension along generic 2 n 2 parameter families of discs in particular the discs which pass through a fixed boundary point the conclusion seems to be natural in the framework of cr geometry but less in the classical literature of harmonic analysis also it is in contrast with the case in which the center of the system of discs is an interior point of the ball a single point does not suffice for this reason i want to supply here a direct proof which only uses taylor expansions moment condition forces coefficients of the antiholomorphic powers to vanish the technique is specific of the sphere general convex domains are out of reach unless one brings into play as i do in 2 the extraordinary strength of the riemann lempert theorem cf 4 and 3 this makes equivalent the family of discs by a point of a convex domain to the lines by a point of the ball let bn be the ball in cn bn the sphere zo a point in b n and c the real analytic functions theorem 1 1 let f be a function in c bn and suppose that f extends from bn along each line passing through zo then f extends holomorphically to b n proof a we first prove the result for b 2 in c 2 it is not restrictive that zo is the pole 0 1 the straight discs through 0 1 can be parametrized over a c as the sets da described by da 1 1 a 2 a 1 1 a 2 1 note that when a 1 the disc da becomes very close to the complex tangent line to the sphere at the point zo and moreover da lies in a neighborhood of zo 1 http arxiv org abs 0911 2560 v 1 2 l baracco since f c b 2 and z 2 is transverse to b 2 at zo f can be extended in a neigh borhood of zo holomorphically in z 2 we denote again by f this extension we consider the power series development of f at zo f z 1 z 1 z 2 l 0 h k 2 m l bh k mz h 1 z k 1 z m 2 note that we reordered the terms in a weighted degree giving weight 2 to z 2 taking a sufficiently big we consider the n momentum on the disc da g a n nf da d 1 1 n l 0 h k 2 m l bh k m 1 1 a 2 a h 1 1 a 2 a k 1 1 a 2 m 1 2 we want to prove that bh k m 0 whenever k 0 to this end let lo be the lowest weighted degree such that bh k m 6 0 for some k 0 and let ko be the highest degree in z 1 for which this happens we get g a n 0 for any n and any a in particular for ta with a 1 and t consider the limit lim t g ta n tlo lim t l lo h k 2 m l k n 2 i 1 k h n 1 1 3 h k m k n 1 aha k 1 t 2 a 2 m tlo l 1 1 t 2 a 2 l 1 4 h k 2 m lo k n 2 i 1 h k n 1 h k m k n 1 bh k m aha k a 2 m a 2 lo 0 1 5 where we have used the fact that n 1 h 1 k 1 md 1 k 1 h k m k l d 1 h m n 1 h k m k 1 n now choosing n ko 1 we get the following relation on the coefficients b s h ko 2 m lo 1 h m ko h ko m 1 bh ko ma h ma ko m 0 writing a ei we get h ko 2 m lo 1 h m ko h ko m 1 bh ko me i h ko 0 which implies bh ko m 0 for h ko 2 m lo therefore when k 1 we have bh k m 0 for any weighted degree l this concludes the proof in dimension 2 holomorphic extension from the sphere to the ball 3 b we pass to the ball bn of general dimension we still suppose that zo is the pole 0 1 by a we know that f extends holomorphically along the slices of bn with the 2 dimensional planes through 0 and zo the different extensions glue to a single well defined function on bn because on the complex line l through 0 and zo where they all overlap they have to coincide by the caucly formula over l bn also by cauchy kowalevski theorem f extends to a neighborhood of zo in b n as a holomorphic function of zn this must coincide with the extension along the slices but it is in addition c in any of these slices f is holomorphic in radial directions and therefore by forelli s theorem cf for instance 6 it is holomorphic since it is also holomorphic in zn then it is holomorphic in a neighborhood of zo in b n by real analyticity the holomorphicity of the extension propagates from a neighborhood of zo to a neighborhood of the whole b n finally by hartogs theorem f is in fact holomorphic in the whole bn references 1 m
