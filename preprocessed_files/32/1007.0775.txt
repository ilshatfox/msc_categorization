on a compact pseudoconvex cr submanifold of cn of hypersurface type that satisfies property p when the submanifold is orientable these estimates were proved by a raich in 32 using microlocal methods our proof deduces the estimates from a slight extension when q 1 of those known on hypersurfaces via the fact that locally cr submanifolds of hypersurface type are cr equivalent to a hypersurface the relationship between two potential theoretic conditions is also clarified 1 introduction a cr submanifold m of cn is of hypersurface type if the complex tangent bun dle has real codimension 1 inside the real tangent bundle of m for background on cr manifolds we refer the reader to the books 3 7 13 45 the complex of the ambient cn induces the extrinsic b complex on m 7 chapter 8 13 chapter 7 in this paper we will study the associated complex green operator on a compact pseudoconvex cr submanifold of cn of hypersurface type these submanifolds are possibly non orientable generalizations to codimension greater than one of bound aries of bounded pseudoconvex domains 1 that b hence b and b have closed range in l 2 m when m is the boundary of a smooth bounded pseudoconvex domain in cn was shown in 37 5 25 compactness estimates for these operators when the boundary of the domain satisfies a potential theoretic condition known as property p were established only recently in 33 the results in 33 and ours are actually more precise see section 3 below see also 27 for general m the closed range properties are also surprisingly recent they were es tablished in 31 for m with dim m 5 compare also 19 the case dim m 3 is open subsequently raich further developed the microlocal methods of 31 to derive compactness estimates when m satisfies a cr analogue of property p and is also orientable 32 because compactness is a local property one would not expect ori entability to be crucial in this paper we give a new proof of the compactness results in 32 that indeed does not require orientability more specifically because locally m is cr equivalent to a hypersurface these results should follow directly from the cor responding results on hypersurfaces in our joint work in 33 prima

sense of currents 20 this is not strong enough to apply known methods as in 25 33 1 http arxiv org abs 1007 0775 v 2 2 emil j straube straightforward again because compactness is a local property however two issues arise immediately first b does not commute with pullbacks under cr mappings this turns out to be easy to handle in the context of compactness 2 second and more importantly the behavior under biholomorphisms and under cr equivalences of the version of property p appropriate for 0 q forms is not understood when q 1 this is of independent interest also for because compactness of is known to be invariant the same remark applies to the behavior under a change in the metric see 12 for the invariance of compactness we sidestep the question of invariance by showing that property p with respect to a general metric still implies the desired compactness estimates we also clarify the relationship between seemingly different versions of property p type conditions in particular we show that for submanifolds of cn as above prop erty p and its cr analogue from 32 are actually equivalent compactness estimates for b imply that the complex green operator is continuous in sobolev norms see the discussion at the end of section 3 but it is also of interest to study estimates in sobolev norms in situations where compactness may not hold when m is the boundary of a smooth bounded pseudoconvex domain in cn such estimates were established in 6 when the domain admits a defining function that is plurisubharmonic at points of the boundary i e m this class of domains includes the convex domains we plan to address the question of sobolev estimates in the case of submanifolds of hypersurface type in a future paper when m is not assumed of hypersurface type it is not known whether the results for b discussed above hold it is not obvious that the methods of 31 33 32 carry over what the methods of the present paper show is that at least for the implication from property p to compactness one can restrict attention to generic submanifolds if m is of hypersurface type this means to hypersurfaces finally when embedability is dropped from the assumptions b need not have closed range in l 2 indeed the closed range property is quite intimately related to embedability see for example 26 7 chapters 11 and 12 and 13 chapter 12 for a discussion of these issues whether a compactness estimate which implies closed range see the discussion in the next section has any implications for embedability seems to be unknown 3 positive results in this direction would certainly provide ample motivation for studying sufficient conditions for compactness also on abstract cr manifolds 2 cr submanifolds and b let m cn be a compact smooth cr submanifold for z m the complex tangent space tcz m is defined as tz m jtz m where j is multiplication by i 2 using a metric free version of the b complex see e g 7 would also remedy this situation but the results in 33 are for the extrinsic complex so an argument has to be made somewhere here the point is simply that the behavior of the extrinsically defined b under pullbacks notwithstanding compactness is preserved under cr equivalences see remark 6 at the end of section 4 3 however compactness should yield global regularity properties also in this situation these properties are favorable for embedability in view of burns modification 9 of the boutet de monvel embedding theorem 8 see theorem 12 2 2 in 13 what is not clear is whether points can still be separated when strict pseudoconvexity is replaced by compactness estimates for b the complex green operator compactness 3 the spaces tcz m form the complex tangent bundle t c m t 1 0 m denotes the bundle of complex vector fields of type 1 0 tangent to m t 1 0 z m and t c z m are c linearly isomorphic via n j 1 aj zj a 1 an m is said to be of hypersur face type if at each point z m tcz m has real codimension one inside tz m that is if m 1 is the complex dimension of tcz m for z m the cr dimension of m then the real dimension of m is 2 m 1 the notation m 1 is chosen here in analogy to a hypersurface in cm and will be convenient later locally near a point z m chose a real vector field t t m that is transversal to tc m at each point the levi form at z is the hermitian form lz on t 1 0 z m given by 1 1 2 i x y lz x y t mod t 1 0 z m t 0 1 z m x y t 1 0 z m m is pseudoconvex if every point has a neighborhood where the levi form is positive or negative semidefinite the latter property is independent of the choice of t in the case of an embedded hypersurface this definition agrees with the familiar one note that we are not assuming m to be orientable so such t s need not be defined globally 0 q m denotes as usual the bundle of 0 q forms on m that is the bundle obtained from 0 q cn by first restricting the bundle to m and then quotenting out at each point the restriction to the point of the ideal generated by a set of local defining functions and their s see 7 chapter 8 13 chapter 7 alternatively this is the bundle of skew symmetric multilinear maps on t 0 1 m q to c locally these forms can be described as follows let l 1 lm 1 be an orthonormal basis locally of t 1 0 m where the inner product on vectors is the one inherited from the ambient cn denote by 1 m 1 the dual basis in t 1 0 m 1 0 m then a 0 q form u can be written uniquely as u j q uj j where indicates summation over strictly increasing multi indices j j 1 jq 1 m 1 q only and j j 1 jq we still may conveniently take the coefficients uj to be defined for all j by skew symmetry the b complex on m is induced by the complex on c n if u is a smooth section of 0 q m choose a section u of 0 q cn whose tangential part agrees with u at points of m then bu equals the tangential part of u this definition is independent of the choice of the extension u see again 7 13 for details in local coordinates as above this gives that for a function f bf m 1 j 1 lj f j for a 0 q from u j q uj j with q 0 one has 2 bu j q m 1 j 1 lj uj j j j q uj b j note that in the second sum on the right hand side of 2 the coefficients uj are not differentiated the inner product in cn induces a pointwise inner product in t 1 0 m and therefore in 0 1 m by duality declaring j and i orthonormal when j 6 i as sets results in a pointwise inner product on 0 q m note that this inner product is well defined it is independent of the choice of local orthonormal basis l 1 lm 1 as above this inner product denoted by z then induces an l 2 inner product via 4 emil j straube integration against lebesgue measure d m on m induced from the ambient c n 3 u v m m u v zd m z we denote by l 2 0 q m the hilbert space of l 2 sections of 0 q m provided with the inner product 3 locally elements of l 2 0 q m are still written as above but the coefficients uj are now in l 2 locally b is defined from l 2 0 q m to l 2 0 q 1 m as a closed densely defined operator in the usual manner a form u is in the domain of b if its coefficients computed in local coordinates in the sense of distributions via 2 are square integrable the resulting complex is the l 2 b complex as a closed densely defined operator b has an adjoint b l 2 0 q 1 m l 2 0 q m integration by parts gives that in local coordinates if u j q uj j then 4 bu m 1 j 1 k q 1 ljujk k terms of order zero compare 15 p 94 13 section 8 3 finally b q is defined by b qu b bu b bu with domain coinsisting of those forms in l 2 0 q m where the compositions are defined b q is selfadjoint in fact it is the unique selfadjoint operator associated with the closed quadratic form see 14 theorem 4 4 2 34 theorem viii 15 qb q u u bu bu m bu bu m with form domain equal to dom b dom b the proof of this equality is essentially the same as that of proposition 2 8 in 42 where the corresponding fact in the context of the complex is proved 3 compactness of the complex green operator recall that a compact set k cn is said to satisfy property pq if the following holds for every a 0 there is a c 2 function a defined in some neighborhood ua of k such that 5 0 a z 1 z ua and 6 k q 1 n j k 1 2 a z zj zk wjkwkk a w 2 z ua w 0 q z where 0 qz denotes the space of 0 q forms at z for q 1 and k the boundary of a pseudoconvex domain this property was introduced in 10 catlin showed that when the boundary is sufficiently smooth this restriction was removed in 40 and satisfies the condition then the neumann operator on 0 1 forms on the domain is compact in the above form still for q 1 the condition was studied in detail under the name b regularity in 39 for q 1 the property appears in 16 17 sibony s analysis carries over to the q 1 case in a straightforward manner details including the relevance of property pq for compactness of the neumann operator on 0 q forms may be found in 42 chapter 4 in particular lemma 4 7 there gives two useful equivalent formulations of 6 first the sum of any q equivalently the the complex green operator compactness 5 smallest q eigenvalues of the complex hessian of a at z is at least a it is immediate from this formulation that property pq implies property pq 1 second 7 q s 1 n j k 1 2 a z zj zk ts j t s k a whenever t 1 tq are orthonormal in cn we can now formulate the main result of this paper which says that property pq is also sufficient for compactness in the b complex at the level of 0 q forms for compact pseudoconvex cr submanifolds of hypersurface type modulo a modification that is necessary namely the property has to be assumed at the symmetric form levels q and m 1 q where where m 1 is the cr dimension of m theorem 1 let m cn be a smooth compact pseudoconvex cr submanifold of hy persurface type assume that m satisfies property pq and property pm 1 q equiv alently pmin q m 1 q where 1 q m 2 then the following compactness estimate holds for all 0 there exists a constant c such that 8 u l 2 0 q m bu l 2 0 q 1 m bu l 2 0 q 1 m c u w 1 0 q m for all u dom b dom b by symmetry the same family of estimates holds for q replaced by m 1 q note that the condition 1 q m 2 implies m 3 so that the real dimension of m is at least five formally the restriction which is also present in 33 32 arises because if q 0 or q m 1 the assumption would involve property p 0 and it is not clear what an appropriate interpretation of p 0 is when m is at least three one can obtain a substitute to the effect that p 1 is a sufficient condition for compactness of the complex green operator on 0 0 forms functions and on 0 m 1 forms details are in 33 last paragraph of section 1 and 32 discussion following the statement of theorem 1 1 the case m 2 i e dim m 3 is not understood that the assumptions in theorem 1 have to be made at symmetric form levels is essentially dictated by lemma 1 below and corresponds to the symmetry between q and n 1 q forms in the case of the boundary of a domain treated in 33 in turn the phenomenon that a condition at the level of q forms in the interior of a domain needs to be imposed at symmetric levels on the boundary to obtain the analogous estimates goes back at least to the conditions z q and y q which equals z q and z n 1 q the conditions for subelliptic 1 2 estimates in the interior and on the boundary respectively compare for example 15 p 57 94 and 13 p 192 193 lemma 1 let m cn be a smooth compact pseudoconvex cr submanifold of hyper surface type 1 q m 1 where m 1 is the cr dimension of m a compactness estimate 8 holds for 0 q forms if and only if it holds for 0 m 1 q forms proof for the case of subelliptic estimates lemma 1 is contained in 23 corollary 6 7 and its proof the proof there relies on a hodge type construction that results in isomorphisms between l 2 0 q m and l 2 0 m 1 q m which intertwine b and b modulo terms of order zero compare also 24 page 255 an alternative construction 6 emil j straube based on a natural sesquilinear pairing is in the appendix of 33 these terms can be absorbed koenig s proof works verbatim for lemma 1 remark 1 the reason why the constructions in the proof of lemma 1 work is that m is a manifold without boundary so that being in the domain of b does not involve a boundary condition the analogous constructions on a domain fail because they result in forms which need not be in the domain of and the symmetry between form levels with respect to subellipticity and compactness is indeed absent in general on a domain in cn in addition to the references already given the reader should also consult 27 19 and 22 in this connection remark 2 there is a version of property pq introduced in 29 called property p q there and shown to imply compactness of nq pq implies p q but to what extent the latter is actually more general is not understood at present for this reason and because the proof of theorem 1 requires some of the analysis of property pq from 39 17 42 that is not yet available for p q we have chosen to work with pq there are also geometric sufficient conditions for compactness of the neumann operator in terms of short time flows generated by suitable complex tangential vector fields these ideas whose relationship to p p is not understood in general were introduced for the case of c 2 in 41 and generalized for cn in 30 see also 42 section 4 11 the geometric arguments from these papers are expected to apply in the context of the present paper as well but we do not pursue this direction here theorem 1 is proved in section 4 we conclude this section by noting that the compactness estimate 8 implies first the usual l 2 theory and then the customary sobolev estimates in particular hq ker b q equals ker b ker b and is finite dimensional both b and b have closed range and we have the estimate 9 u l 2 0 q m c bu l 2 0 q 1 m bu l 2 0 q 1 m u dom b dom b u hq see for example 21 theorems 1 1 3 and 1 1 2 it follows further that b q maps the orthogonal complement of hq onto itself and has a bounded inverse there the complex green operator gq compare for example the proof of theorem 9 4 2 in 13 we take gq to be defined on all of l 2 0 q m extending it linearly so that it is zero on hq this amounts to precomposing gq with the orthogonal projection onto hq and so does not affect compactness of the operator finally 8 also shows for 1 q n 2 that gq is compact see for example 42 proposition 4 2 were these arguments are detailed in the context of the neumann operator once the l 2 theory is established the various estimates can be lifted by standard methods to sobolev spaces again using 8 to obtain that the ranges in question are closed also in w s m for s 0 and that gq is compact in particular continuous in w s 0 q m s 0 see for example 32 subsection 5 3 28 proof of theorem 3 the complex green operator compactness 7 4 proof of theorem 1 we begin with some geometric preparations fix p m near p m is a graph over a smooth hypersurface in cm see 3 7 after suitably rotating coordinates we may assume that the graphing function is just the inverse of the projection cn cm z 1 zn 7 z 1 zm and p 0 10 z 1 zm 7 z 1 zm h 1 z 1 zm hn m z 1 zm z 1 zm m where hj 1 j n m is a cr function on m and the map 10 is a cr diffeomorphism namely the inverse of the restriction of to m because m is pseudoconvex m is a pseudoconvex hypersurface in cm denote by a smooth pseudoconvex domain whose boundary contains a neighborhood of 0 in m and whose other boundary points are strictly pseudoconvex this can be done along the lines of the construction in section 4 of 4 ignoring the parts that refer to finite type compare also 2 18 these constructions start with a domain rather than just with a piece of hypersurface such as m but everything is local including a defining function such that a suitable power is strictly plurisubharmonic on the side of m where it is negative in principle m could be pseudoconvex from both sides that is levi flat in which case we would just choose one side as the pseudoconvex side however this does not happen in our situation by assumption m satisfies property pq hence property pm 1 therefore it cannot contain complex varieties of dimension m 1 42 lemma 4 20 the statement there is for the boundary of a domain but the same proof works in the present situation but then m cannot contain such varieties either and a fortiori it cannot be levi flat near p choose an orthonormal basis l 1 lm 1 for t 1 0 m with associated dual basis 1 m 1 as in section 2 denote by z 1 zm 1 the projection of l 1 lm 1 this gives a local basis for t 1 0 m let 1 m 1 be the dual basis note that while zj lj 1 j m 1 j 6 j in general compare the discussion in 7 section 9 2 for a 0 q form u j q uj j on m that is supported sufficiently close to p we define a 0 q from u on m as follows 11 u z j q uj 1 z j z m again note that u 6 u in general in fact need not take 0 1 m 0 2 m 0 m 1 m to 0 1 m 0 m 1 m see again 7 section 9 2 in particular lemma 2 commutes with wedge products most importantly for us it also commutes with b and b modulo error terms of order zero indeed by 2 we have b m u z j j zj uj 1 z j j terms of order zero over 8 emil j straube 12 j j ljuj 1 z j j terms of order zero j j ljuj j j terms of order zero b mu z terms of order zero where the additional subscripts on b have their obvious meaning and terms of order zero refers to the coefficients uj 1 z an analogous computation using 4 gives 13 b m u z b mu z terms of order zero to prove the compactness estimate 8 it suffices via a partition of unity to prove the estimate for forms that are supported in small neighborhoods where the above construction is valid for such a form u 11 and 13 show that 8 holds if and only if a corresponding estimate holds for u on m this will follow if there is a compactness estimate for 0 q forms on b since u is supported near 0 it can be viewed as a form on b we are now in a position to give the simple proof when q 1 so assume q 1 we claim that b satisfies property p 1 first compact subsets of b m satisfy property p 1 as compact subsets of a strictly pseudoconvex hypersurface this is a special case of proposition 1 12 39 proposition 4 15 42 it is also implicit in 10 second 1 can be extended as a c map f f 1 fn into a neighborhood of m in such a way that fj 1 j n vanishes to infinite order on m see for example 7 theorem 2 section 9 1 a standard computation shows that the pullbacks under f of the functions a with large hessians from the definition of property p 1 for m have large hessians at points of m in directions in the complex tanget space adding b 2 where is a defining function for m and b is large enough produces a function with large hessian in all directions compare the arguments in the proof of proposition 1 in section 5 below by continuity there is a neighborhood of the compact set b m depending on a where the hessian is at least a 2 also in a small enough neighborhood again depending on a the pullbacks will be bounded independently of a by say 3 2 in other words b m satisfies property p 1 therefore b is a countable union of compact sets all of which satisfy property p 1 hence so does b 39 proposition 1 9 42 corollary 4 14 then b also satisfies pm 1 q since 1 m 1 q and theorem 1 4 in 33 gives a compactness estimate for 0 1 forms on b this completes the proof of theorem 1 when q 1 when q 1 the argument involving the pullbacks of the functions a no longer works in such a straightforward way this is essentially the statement that property pq is no longer obviously invariant under biholomorphisms when q 1 the author does not know whether it actually is the reason for this failure is simple biholomorphic maps are in general not conformal so that the push forward of a set of orthonor mal vectors as in 7 is not orthonormal in general 4 we remedy this situation by modifying the euclidean metric near m see 14 below so that the matrix of 4 see remarks 3 and 4 below for further discussion the complex green operator compactness 9 the hessian of the pullback of a with respect to this modified metric satisfies 7 see 18 below we then derive analogues of the weighted estimates 19 in 33 for this metric both on and on b where b is a big ball containing see 19 below once these estimates are established the arguments in 33 apply again to first give compactness of the respective neumann operators and then the desired compactness estimate for 0 q forms on b we start with it is convenient although not necessary to use that in our situation more can be said about extending cr functions from m because m contains no analytic varieties of dimension m 1 as observed at the end of the first paragraph of this section cr functions on m extend holomorphically to the pseudoconvex side of m 44 thus locally m actually is the boundary in the c sense of a complex manifold m 5 m is graphed over a one sided neighborhood of m the graphing functions h 1 z 1 zm hn m z 1 zm are simply the one sided holomorphic extensions of h 1 hn m from 10 extend l 1 lm 1 and augment the set by lm so that these vector fields form an orthonormal basis for t 1 0 m locally smooth up to the boundary m denote by 1 m the dual basis via this gives fields z 1 zm defined in a one sided neighborhood of m and smooth up to the boundary m let 1 m be the dual basis next choose a cutoff function 1 that equals one near m b that is supported in a sufficiently small neighborhood of m b and that takes values in 0 1 for a 0 q from v on denote by vj the coefficients with respect to 1 m vj is defined on the support of 1 shrinking that support if necessary recall that v 1 v 2 z denotes the euclidean inner product between 0 q forms at the point z cm for z we define the following new pointwise inner product on 0 q forms 14 v 1 v 2 z 1 z j q v 1 j v 2 j 1 1 z v 1 v 2 z the norms induced by these inner products are equivalent to the pointwise eu clidean norms uniformly in z we introduce weighted l 2 inner products 15 v 1 v 2 v 1 v 2 z e z dv z where for the moment is only assumed smooth on the reader should keep in mind that these are not just weighted inner products as the term is typically used the pointwise inner product 14 involves a more substantial change of metric near m namely z 1 zm hence 1 m are declared orthonormal in particular the domain of the adjoint of changes for a discussion of these matters see for example 12 p 175 176 for a 0 q from u and a function equal to one on b m and supported where 1 equals one calculation of the kohn morrey ho rmander formula in local coordinates and dropping the nonnegative boundary term gives see for example 36 5 if m is also orientable this kneser lewy type extension property combines with 20 to give that in fact m is globally the boundary of a complex manifold 25 p 526 10 emil j straube formula 3 17 1 proposition 2 1 with s 0 45 proposition 1 9 1 with q 0 0 16 k q 1 m j k 1 jk u jk u kk e 2 u 2 u 2 c u 2 u c 0 q dom where the matrix jk 1 j k m is defined via m j k 1 jk j k on the support of and c is a constant that does not depend on next we choose z a z for a 0 let a be the function from the definition of property pq for m pick a cutoff function a 0 a 1 that equals one in a neighborhood of b m is supported where 1 equals one so 1 and a are nested and whose support is also small enough so that the composition with the graphing function for m is defined on this support this last condition makes a dependent on a whence the subscript set 17 a z a z a z 1 zm h 1 z 1 zm hn m z 1 zm that is a is the pullback under the graphing function for m of a times the cutoff factor a and so is defined on all of we claim that for z in the set where a equals one the matrix a jk z satisfies 7 let t 1 tq be orthonormal in cm then by the definition of a jk note that j 1 k 1 zj 2 zk 2 1 2 j 1 j 2 k 1 k 2 18 q s 1 m j k 1 a jk z t s j t s k 2 q s 1 a z m j 1 ts jzj z m k 1 ts k zk z 2 q s 1 a m j 1 ts jlj m k 1 ts k lk a where z 1 zm h 1 z hn m z in the last inequality in 18 we have used 7 and the fact that the vectors m j 1 t s jlj 1 s q are orthonormal in cn because ts 1 s q are orthonormal in cm and lj 1 j m are orthonormal in cn this establishes the claim with a chosen we establish the following estimate 19 u 2 a c a u 2 a a u 2 a ca u 1 a u dom a dom a for a big enough here the subscript a refers to the norms given by 15 with a and the corresponding adjoint of note that in view of the uniform bounds on a and the uniform equivalence of the pointwise inner products 14 these norms are equivalent to the euclidean norm on forms uniformly in a restrict the cutoff function from above to be supported on the set where a equals one and still let it equal one in a small neighborhood of b m and denote it by a then both the support of 1 a and the suport of a intersect the boundary of in the set of strictly pseudoconvex boundary points near such points there is a subelliptic 1 2 estimate this can be seen by checking that the usual proofs based on the boundary term in the kohn morrey ho rmander formula still apply when the formula is written in terms of local coordinates 15 13 42 alternatively there the complex green operator compactness 11 is a general result by sweeney 43 to the effect that subellipticity is independent of the metric this is however considerably more sophisticted than what is needed here combining these estimates with interpolation of sobolev norms and setting ea max a 1 gives 20 1 a u 2 a 1 aea 1 a u 2 1 2 a ca 1 a u 2 1 a c aea 1 a u 2 a a 1 a u 2 a ca 1 a u 2 1 a c a u 2 a a u 2 a u 2 a ca u 2 1 a we note that as usual constants are allowed to change from one occurrence to the next on the other hand for au we obtain from 16 18 and the equivalence of 6 and 7 and for u c 0 q dom a 21 au 2 a 2 a au 2 a a au 2 a c a au 2 a 2 a u 2 a a u 2 a a u 2 a c a u 2 a c a u 2 a a u 2 a u 2 a ca u 2 1 a where a u stands for terms of the form derivative of a times u the last in equality in 21 follows by an interpolation of sobolev norms for these terms similar to the one used in 20 adding estimates 20 and 21 and absorbing the u 2 a terms gives 19 for a big enough and for u c 0 q dom a finally when u is only in dom a dom a we invoke the density in the graph norm of forms smooth up to the bound ary this density can be established in the same way as for the euclidean norm one can check that for example the proof in 42 proposition 2 3 also work for the metrics considered here this establishes 19 having established 19 on we now turn to b the argument here consists of an adaption of the proof of proposition 3 1 in 33 to the effect that the standard neumann operator n q is compact if b satisfies property pm 1 q the vector fields zj 1 j m defined only in a one sided neighborhood of m can be extended into a full neighborhood of b m the forms 1 m then also extend as dual to z 1 zm now define a pointwise inner product and then an l 2 inner product on in analogy to 14 and 15 define a as in 17 but with a now the negative of the function that comes from the definition of property pm 1 q of m then a is defined in a one sided neighborhood of m and a jk satisfies 18 with q replaced by m 1 q we can extend a into a full neighborhood of b m depending on a so that 18 with a in place of a and q replaced by m 1 q still holds there possibly replacing a by a 2 which is immaterial and also keeping a uniform bound we also choose a as above equal to one in a neighborhood of b m and supported near b m as well 12 emil j straube for u c 0 q dom a we again split u into au 1 a u the estimation of 1 a u is the same as above except that on the strictly pseudoconcave part of the boundary of one has to invoke condition z q 15 p 57 for the subelliptic 1 2 estimate namely for z b b m viewed as a boundary point of the levi form has m 1 q 1 negative eigenvalues by 21 theorem 3 25 or 15 theorem 3 2 2 this implies to a subelliptic 1 2 estimate actually in both these references the estimate is formulated not in terms of the 1 2 norm but rather in terms of the l 2 norm on the boundary but the 1 2 estimate follows from this via elliptic theory u 1 2 is dominated by the boundary l 2 norm plus the 1 norm of au which in turn is dominated by u a u see for example 42 proof of proposition 3 1 compare also 28 theorem 5 to estimate au we start by replacing 16 with the following estimate which now also includes the boundary terms 22 k q 1 m j k 1 a jk au jk au kk e a j q j m 1 a jj auj 2 e a b k q 1 m j k 1 jk au jk au kk e a b j q j m 1 jj auj 2 e a 2 au 2 a a au 2 a c au 2 a u c 0 q dom a where c does not depend on a and is a normalized defining function for b say near b m 22 is in 1 proposition 2 1 with s m 1 and in 45 proposition 1 9 1 with q 0 m 1 it is implicit already in 36 formula 3 23 now the argument follows verbatim the one in 33 starting with inequality 15 there and we outline it only briefly referring the reader to 33 for details the first observation is that the boundary terms can be collected into 23 b k q 1 m 1 j k 1 jk 1 q m 1 l 1 ll jk au jk au kk e a see 16 in 33 the sum over k q 1 is also only over k that do not con tain m since then ujk 0 because u dom a therefore the sum in the integrand equals at least au 2 times the sum of the smallest q eigenvalues of the hermitian matrix in the integrand this sum equals minus the trace plus the sum of the smallest q eigenvalues of jk m 1 jk 1 so equals minus the sum of m 1 q eigen values of jk m 1 jk 1 because the complex hessian of is negative semidefinite on the complex tangent space this sum is nonnegative thus the boundary terms give a nonnegative contribution to the left hand side of 22 and can be dropped from the inequality in the terms involving integration over the interior restricting the sums over k with m k j k m and j with m j makes an error that is controlled as follows when m j uj vanishes on the boundary because u dom a and a au a au 1 controls au j 1 this is well known for the euclidean the complex green operator compactness 13 metric for a proof see 42 lemma 2 12 for the case of our metric the same argu ment works because the second order part of a still acts diagonally in the chosen basis via an elliptic operator this is essentially the same computation as in the euclidean case but done in local coordinates the constant in the resulting estimate depends on a via interpolation of sobolev norms we obtain control of au j in terms of the right hand side of 22 modulo adding au 1 the resulting estimate corresponding to 18 in 33 is 24 k q 1 m 1 j k 1 a jk 1 q m 1 l 1 a ll jk au jk au kk e a c au 2 a a au 2 a au 2 a ca au 2 1 a where denotes summation over strictly increasing multi indices that do not con tain m arguing as above we obtain that the integrand in the left hand side of 24 is at least au 2 times minus the sum of m 1 q eigenvalues of a jk m 1 j k 1 this sum is at least equal to the sum of the smallest m 1 q eigenvalues of a jk m j k 1 which in turn is at least a this is why we chose the negative sign in the definition of a choosing a big enough and absorbing the au 2 a term gives the desired estimate 25 au 2 a c a au 2 a a au 2 a ca au 2 1 a with c independent of a again invoking the density of forms smooth up to the boundary in the graph norm compare the remark in the paragraph following 21 25 carries over to u dom dom a combining 25 with the estimate for 1 a u gives 19 on as well from now on the argument follows 33 essentially verbatim first 19 on and implies compactness of the neumann operators n q and n q respectively this is shown in 33 on pages 772 773 the fact that here the unweighted norm is not the euclidean norm and consequently the domain of the adjoint of may change see 12 does not matter what does is that it is comparable to the euclidean norm so that the norms a are also and uniformly so with respect to a the argument for is slightly simpler in that the space of harmonic forms is trivial this actually turns out to be the case also on 1 q m 2 as shown recently in 38 finally compactness of both n q and n q implies the desired compactness estimate on 0 q forms on b this is shown in 33 section 4 remark 3 the fact that property pq is not known to be invariant under say local biholomorphisms smooth up to the boundary is unsatisfactory from the per spective of the property as a sufficient condition for compactness of nq the latter is invariant pullbacks of compact solution operators for on the image domain produce compact solution operators on the source domain see 42 proof of the implication i ii in theorem 4 26 this invariance may be viewed as a special case of in variance under a change of metric by pulling back the metric from the image domain to the source domain as in the proof of theorem 1 see 12 for the invariance of compactness under a change of metric among metrics smooth up to the boundary 14 emil j straube the part of the proof of theorem 1 where we worked on shows in particular that it suffices for compactness of nq that there exist some metric smooth up to the bound ary with respect to which property pq holds in the sense of 18 likewise the work for shows that such an invariant version of proposition 3 1 in 33 holds for as a result there is an invariant version of theorem 1 4 in 33 this is the slight extension referred to in the abstract remark 4 in light of the comments in the previous remark and the invariance result in 12 it seems appropriate for the time being to re formulate property pq invariantly when q 1 that is there should exist a metric smooth up to the boundary so that pq holds with respect to this metric in the sense of 18 remark 5 a slightly different approach to the proof of theorem 1 is as follows instead of establishing compactness of n q and n q one establishes compactness of n q and n m 1 q from properties pq and pm 1 q of m respectively so this is only one proof compactness at these two symmetric levels in the interior implies compactness on the boundary at the level of 0 q forms 1 q m 2 this implication is implicit in 27 and explicit within a general context in 22 on the other hand the argument for the annular domain used above is of interest in its own right remark 6 for emphasis we point out the following observation which was used in the proof of theorem 1 b defined extrinsically does not commute with pullbacks under cr equivalences between cr submanifolds of cn consequently results about the complex associated with a particular cr submanifold do not automatically trans fer to the complex on a cr equivalent submanifold nonetheless solvability for b is preserved 7 corollary 2 section 9 2 and so is compactness the compactness esti mate 8 is preserved under cr equivalences this is immediate from the properties 11 13 of the modified pullback 5 two potential theoretic conditions in 32 property cr pq is introduced for an orientable m and it is shown that cr pq and cr pm 1 q are sufficient for compactness of gq it is also shown that pq implies cr pq we show here that the two are actually equivalent in fact both are equivalent to a version of pq where the condition on the hessian is required only in complex tangential directions that lie in the nullspace of the levi form in the context of p q for the boundary of a domain this was observed in 11 proposition 1 compare also 35 corollary 2 and the remark that follows we recall the definition of property cr pq from 32 m is a smooth orientable cr submanifold of cn of hypersurface type because m is orientable the real vector field t from section 2 can be chosen globally denote by the 1 form on m that annihilates t 1 0 m t 0 1 m and that is constant one on t then the levi form 1 equals 1 2 i l l i 2 d l l where l is a local section of t 1 0 m the equality follows from the definition of the exterior derivative and the fact that l l 0 replacing t by t hence by if necessary we may assume that the levi form is positive definite let i 2 then m is said the complex green operator compactness 15 to satisfy property cr pq if for every a 0 there exist a function a defined in a neighborhood u of m with 0 a 1 and a constant a 0 such that 26 q j 1 1 2 b b a b b a a 0 d lj lj a at all points z m and any set lj q j 1 of orthonormal vectors in t 1 0 z m 32 definition 2 6 we say that m satisfies property pq on the nullspace of the levi form if for every a 0 there exists a smooth function a defined in a neighborhood ua of m with 0 a 1 and 27 q s 1 n j k 1 2 a z zj zk ls j ls k a whenever l 1 lq are orthonormal and are contained in the nullspace nz of the levi form of m at z m proposition 1 let m cn be a smooth compact pseudoconvex cr submanifold of hypersurface type let 1 q m 1 where m 1 is the cr dimension of m then the following conditions are equivalent i m satisfies property pq on the nullspace of the levi form ii m satisfies property pq for orientable m i and ii are also equivalent to iii m satisfies property cr pq the implication ii iii is in corollary 1 2 in 32 note that orientability is required for the definition of cr pq in iii proof that ii implies i is a trivial consequence of the definitions the implication iii i is an immediate consequence of 32 proposition 3 2 by that proposition with ls as above so that d ls ls 0 1 s q 28 1 2 q s 1 n j k 1 2 a z zj zk ls j ls k q s 1 a ls ls q s 1 1 2 b b a b b a ls ls 1 2 a q s 1 d ls ls q s 1 1 2 b b a b b a a 0 d ls ls a where a is the derivative of a in the direction of the normal to m given by j the complex structure map of cn times the unit tangent field to m that is perpendicular to tc m the second equality is proposition 3 2 in 32 and the last inequality holds if a is the function from the definition of property cr pq we next show that i implies iii the argument is standard denote by bn the unit ball in cn by s the compact subset of m bbn bbn q fold given by z l 1 lq ls t 1 0 z m 1 s q l 1 lq are orthonormal and by k the compact subset of s given by the requirement that ls nz 1 s q let a 0 16 emil j straube and let a be the function from i then on k again because d ls ls 0 1 s q 29 q j 1 1 2 b b a b b a lj lj q s 1 a ls ls a 2 choose a neighborhood u of k in s so that 29 holds with a 2 1 on the right hand side for z l 1 lq u this can be done by continuity next choose a neighborhood v u of k and denote by b 1 and b 2 the minimum of the left hand side of 29 and the strictly positive minimum of q s 1 d ls ls respectively for z l 1 lq s v then for a 0 0 we have on s v 30 q j 1 1 2 b b a b b a a 0 d lj lj b 1 a 0 b 2 a if a 0 is chosen sufficiently large when z l 1 lq u the left hand side of 30 equals at least q s 1 1 2 b b a b b a ls ls by pseudoconvexity d ls ls 0 hence at least a 2 1 since a 0 is arbitrary and u s v s this and 30 show that m satisfies property cr pq it remains to show i ii the strategy is the same as in the previous argument except that the correction function that makes things big away from k has to be in the form of a hessian so we need to express the levi form in terms of hessians it suffices to prove property pq locally 39 42 recall that here m is not assumed orientable and the levi form is is only defined locally and only up to sign let 1 d d 2 n 2 m 1 be a set of defining functions for m say near a point p so that their gradients are orthonormal choose the field t to be orthogonal to t 1 0 m t 0 1 m by 7 theorem 1 in section 10 2 the levi form is given up to sign by the expression 31 d l 1 n j k 1 2 l zj zk wjwk j l d l 1 n j k 1 2 l j l zj zk wjwk where l n j 1 wj zj t 1 0 m here we think of as being defined also on vectors not in the tangent space to m by setting it equal to zero on t m so that the right hand side of 31 is well defined moreover this definition works locally near m as usual by considering the submanifolds given by l l 1 l d for l small the equality in 31 then holds for z m because l z 0 1 l d and n j 1 l zj z wj 0 we may assume that 31 is nonnegative again changing t to t if necessary let now a 0 and a the function form the definition of property pq on the null space of the levi form then the same argument as above shows that if b 1 is chosen sufficiently large the function a b 1 d l 1 l j l has hessian greater than say a 1 on vectors in t 1 0 m near p because the correction term vanishes at points of m we can keep uniform in a bounds say 1 2 and 3 2 by shrinking the neighborhood ua the actual value of the bounds is immaterial finally adding b 2 d l 1 2 l and choosing b 2 large enough produces a function whose hessian is large on all vectors in cn compare for example 39 proof of lemme 1 13 10 proof of theorem 2 or 42 proof of proposition 4 15 this proves that m the complex green operator compactness 17 satisfies property pq locally and as was noted above this implies that m satisfies pq globally remark 7 proposition 1 is a manifestation of a general albeit somewhat vague principle to the effect that conditions for some regularity property of or b involving the complex tangent space need only be imposed on the nullspace of the levi form in the context of compactness compare again 11 35 in connection with sufficient conditions for global regularity manifestations of this principle occur for example in 42 theorem 5 9 and proposition 5 13 acknowledgement the author is indebted to
