we consider a function f continuous on a domain of r 2 separately real analytic in x 1 and cr extendible to y 2 resp cr extendible to y 2 0 this means that f x 2 extends holomorphically for y 1 x 2 and f x 1 for y 2 resp 0 y 2 continuous up to y 2 0 with independent of x 1 we prove in theorem 3 4 that f is then real analytic resp in theorem 3 5 that it extends holomorphically to a wedge w i where is an open cone trumcated by y and containing the ray 0 y 2 the extension is uniformly continuous up to y 0 and gives f as limit note that the first result can be obtained from the second it follows via the edge of the wedge theorem of 1 from the holomorphic extension to the pair of wedges w which correspond to the two sides y 2 0 but we prefer to give its own simplified proof we point out that it is not made any assumption on uniform continuity or uniform boudedness for the different extensions these come as consequences of the statement in any case boundedness is the main issue once this is proved then continuity follows theorem 2 1 and the holomorphic extension of a function which is cr extendible to both y 1 and y 2 is a consequence of the edge of the wedge theorem of ajrapetyan henkin 1 historically it was earlier obtained by malgrange zerner with specification of the side separate cr continuous extension to y 1 0 and y 2 0 implies holomorphic extension to the quadrant y 1 0 y 2 0 see also komatsu 9 and druzkowski 7 where continuity is replaced by boundedness successively siciak 18 19 proved that cr extension in both arguments implies real analyticity without assumption of continuity or boundedness what we show in the present paper is that cr extension to y 2 and simple real analyticity in x 1 suffices and that cr extension to y 2 0 implies holomorphic extension to a wedge of c 2 with edge r 2 and which points to that side we stress attention to the fact that cr extension in at least one argument is needed as shows the classical example of f x 1 x 2 x 1 x 2 exp 1 x 2 1 x 2 2 as for the proof of our result the main technical tool is a refined version of the hartogs lemma which is contained in theorem 3 1 it is a combination of the fatou s theorem and the phragme n lindelo f principle in the other respects to tackle the problem we introduce a point of view which is new in the context of the separate analyticity that is the cr theory first we show that the cr extensions in either variable are continuous when the other argument is restricted to an open dense range of values we then apply 1 http arxiv org abs math 0606390 v 1 2 l baracco g zampieri the edge of the wedge theorem to extend f to an open set of c 2 and next the theorem by hanges treves 20 to propagate this extension along the planes y 2 const at this point we apply our generalized hartogs lemma to the sequence of the roots of the taylor coefficients of the expansions of f in z 2 to fill all missing values of x 2 in the domain of f the authors are grateful to professor claudio rea for fruitful discussions msc 32 d 10 32 u 05 32 v 25 2 generalized uniformly continuous boundary values let rn and cn be the euclidean real and complex spaces with coordinates x and z x iy respectively and also write x x xn z z zn let be a domain of r n we discuss of boundary values on of functions which solve the cauchy riemann equations on manifolds or wedges of cn with boundary or edge we begin by a result essentially due to 14 on uniform continuity of functions which are holomorphic and tempered in one variable say zn for yn 0 theorem 2 1 let f be a continuous function on such that for some and for all x f x extends holomorphically in zn to 0 yn uniformly continuous up to yn 0 we also suppose that for any xon there are two neighborhoods a b of x o n such that f x xn iyn yn k x xn b a and for a suitable k then f is uniformly continuous for 0 yn and x proof since f is already known to be continuous it suffices to prove that f x xn iyn f x xn 0 as yn 0 uniformly on any we take a function zn of class c c 1 at x o n such that supp r b a and o yn k under this choice we have that f is uniformly bounded we write f f x xn i yn and apply cauchy formula to the function f 1 at 1 for the half plane re 0 we get after substituting i for i 2 1 f x xn iyn 1 f x xn yn 2 1 d 2 i zn f x xn yn yn 1 2 1 d d recall that 1 1 2 1 d 1 hence 2 1 implies 2 2 f x xn iyn f x xn 1 f x xn yn f x xn 2 1 d o yn which yields the conclusion theorem 2 1 can be extended to a general wedge swept by analytic discs this is locally described as the image through a cr embedding into cn of w i where is an open convex cone trumcated by y in a linear subspace of rn here x has a positive lower bound on each compact subset of the embedding is supposed to be separate real analyticity and cr extendibility 3 smooth up to it also holds for more general sets swept by analytic half discs the set w i is said a wedge with edge and directional cone any subset w i with that is 0 and is said a proper subwedge of w we will use the notation w w in this case when is open in rn theorem 2 1 can be remarkably improved we want to explain in what sense a function or more generally a distribution or a hyperfunction f on is the boundary value of a holomorphic function that we still denote f on a wedge w of dimension 2 n a generalized or hyperfunction boundary value acts on g in the space a of real analytic functions on through the integral 2 3 f x iy g x iy dx for y suitably small by cauchy formula the integrations for different y only differ near thus 2 3 defines an element in the quotient a a that we denote by bv f if the holomorphic function f on w is tempered in the sense that f y k for some k as y 0 y then it has a distributional boundary value defined over ck 1 c by 2 4 bv f lim y 0 y f x iy x dx in this case 2 4 is compatible with 2 3 in the sense that the hyperfunction defined on by 2 3 coincides with the distribution defined by 2 4 for continuous functions on we have coincidence of all possible notions of boundary values theorem 2 2 rosay 14 and cordaro private communication let w i be a wedge of dimension 2 n and let f be a continuous function on which is the boundary value of a holomorphic function on w that we still denote by f then f is uniformly continuous on any proper subwedge w w up to and the boundary value is in fact a limit proof the direction in the wave front set of f are contained in the polar cone and this is the same as a hyperfunction and a distribution in this situation f is the boundary value of a tempered holomorphic function on w cf 11 theorem 8 4 15 which must coincide by uniqueness with the former extension at this point one can apply the analogous of theorem 2 1 for functions which are holomorphic in a wedge 14 proposition 1 point 3 differently from boundary value the word extension is ambiguous an extension has full meaning when it is a holomorphic function on a wedge w of dimension 2 n and reproduces the initial function f through 2 3 or 2 4 as we have just seen when f is continuous on and is the boundary value of a holomorphic function on a wedge w of 4 l baracco g zampieri dimension 2 n then it is in fact its uniform limit but a function may happen to extend along discs which fill a wedge w of general dimension without being the uniform limit of its extension first the separate extensions may not glue into a continuous function on w as in the following example which was suggested to us by professor p cordaro example 2 3 we take r r and define f on by f x 1 x 2 x 1 sin x 2 x 1 then f is continuous on and extends as an entire function along each plane x 1 c thus we have here instead of a wedge a manifold without boundary r c but it is not tempered in the neighborhood of any point 0 x 2 as we may check by using for instance the sequence x 1 z 2 1 2 x 2 i 1 also even if f extends separately along discs which cover a wedge w of dimension 2 n and the different extensions glue into a holomorphic function on w there is no evidence that f is the boundary value hence the uniform limit of its extension however this conclusion holds all over when we know from the beginning that it is true over a sufficiently large subset of theorem 2 4 in the situation of theorem 2 1 assume in addition that f extends holo morphically to a wedge w i for an open cone r n which contains the positive yn axis then f is uniformly continuous on any w w up to proof since f is holomorphic in w we know in particular that it is continuous for yn 0 in combination with theorem 2 1 we get the uniform continuity for y 0 yn 0 x in this situation if we inspect 2 3 we see that f is the boundary value in the sense of hyperfunctions of its extension to conclude we have just to apply theorem 2 2 3 two sided and one sided holomorphic extension from r to c before entering the main theme we need some preliminar result on functions of one complex variable let c be the complex plane with coordinate the unit disc c 1 the upper half disc im 0 i the unit real interval i t r t 1 we recall that a subharmonic function is a function which is upper semicontinuous and whose value at any point is dominated by the mean value on the boundary of any disc centered at the following generalization of hartogs lemma will play a crucial role separate real analyticity and cr extendibility 5 theorem 3 1 let us be given a sequence of functions upper semicontinuous on subharmonic on and which satisfy for some constants l and l 3 1 lim sup sup l lim sup t 0 t i sup l then for any and there is such that 3 2 l im for im where is an universal constant proof we denote by the function on which is 0 for im 0 and l for 1 let pz z be the poisson kernel of for any z and 0 and for suitable z we have when z z pz d pz d l im z 3 3 where the first inequality comes from the subharmonicity of each the second from fatou s lemma and the third from the phragme n lindelo f principle for any and for suitable we have 3 4 pz pw d for w z im z 2 imw 2 because pz as a family of functions of z is equicontinuous on im z 2 and since the s are uniformly bounded by a finite covering of im by discs of radius and center at points z with im z 2 we get the conclusion of the proof of the theorem remark 3 2 we will get the same conclusion 3 2 if we replace the half disc by the strip u i i 0 let z x iy be the coordinates in cn an open domain of rn and f a continuous function on definition 3 3 we adopt the following terminology 6 l baracco g zampieri we say that f is separately real analytic in xj if its restriction to the section of with each line parallel to the xj axis is real analytic thus when all the other coordinates are fixed f extends to yj x we say that f is separately cr extendible to yj if it is separately real analytic in xj and moreover it has holomorphic extension to yj with having positive lower bound locally uniform in x we say that f is separately cr extendible to yj 0 or yj 0 if it has a holomor phic extension to 0 yj or yj 0 with locally uniform in x and the extension on each plane zj has locally uniform limit f for yj 0 let cn cn 1 cn 2 with coordinates z z z x iy x iy separate analyticity in the group of variables x means analyticity in x when the other variables are fixed cr extendibility to all the directions of the y plane rn 2 means holomorphic extendibility to y with locally uniform in x cr extendibility to a cone 2 r n 2 means that f extends holomorphically for y 2 y with locally uniform in x we also assume that for fixed x f is locally uniformly continuous up to y 0 clearly real analyticity or cr extendibility in a group of variables x is more restrictive than the combination of real analyticities in any single x j we state now our main results whose proofs will follow in section 4 theorem 3 4 let f be a continuous function on which is separately real analytic in x and cr extendible to y then f is real analytic theorem 3 4 improves siciak s theorem of 18 where it is assumed that f is separately cr extendible both to y and y by iteration theorem 3 4 implies that if f is separately real analytic in x 1 and cr extendible to each single variable y 2 yn then it is in fact real analytic let 1 2 r n rn 1 rn 2 we will denote by an open convex cone in the y space rn and by its trumcature by y we will denote by 2 or 2 the analogous open cones in the y space rn 2 we fix a cone 2 theorem 3 5 let f be a continuous function on which is real analytic in x and cr extendible to 2 then f extends holomorphically to a wedge w i where is a conic neighborhood of an arbitrarily large proper subcone of 2 and is uniformly continuous up to y 0 corollary 3 6 let 1 v 2 be a domain in r n 1 cn 2 and let f be a function in 1 v 2 such that x 1 f x is holomorphic and z v 2 f z is real analytic then f extends holomorphically to a neighborhood w of 1 v 2 cf theorem 1 by shiffman 16 this is a corollary to theorem 3 4 or theorem 3 5 applied to the family of domains obtained by slicing 1 v 2 by the planes y const some care is needed because f 1 v 2 is not assumed to be continuous when v 2 is a wedge 2 i 2 one can see that w is also a wedge i where 2 for an arbitrarily large separate real analyticity and cr extendibility 7 2 2 however theorem 3 5 is far better real analyticity in x for fixed x 2 and not z 2 i 2 suffices let us notice that theorem 3 4 could be obtained from theorem 3 5 in fact cr extension to y implies cr extension to any pair of antipodal open cones 2 r n 2 application of theorem 3 5 implies extension to a pair of wedges w whose profiles are conical neighborhoods of 2 in r n but then the ajrapetyan henkin edge of the wedge theorem gives extension to the directions of the convex hull of the profiles that is the whole of the directions of the y plane rn however for the sake of clearness we will give a separate proof outline of the proof of theorems 3 4 3 5 we start from theorem 3 4 assuming that is the square i 2 1 1 1 1 of r 2 and denoting by the standard disc we consider the sets x 1 i x 1 and x 2 i x 2 x 2 to which f is supposed to extend now by baire s theorem the extension of f is bounded in i and u i for some interval i and some strip u i ii it is easy to prove by cauchy s inequalities that boundedness combined with continuity on i 2 implies in fact continuity for the extensions by the celebrated ajrapetyan henkin s edge of the wedge theorem of 1 f extends to for a new the argument of this theorem consists in attaching analytic discs to the two hypersurfaces and in extending f along these discs by the maximum principle also wherever the extension is continuous we can apply the propagation of the holomorphic extendibility of cr functions along discs in particular f will extend holomorphically to u for a new at this point we apply our generalized hartogs lemma theorem 3 1 above to the sequence z 1 z 2 z 1 0 1 and get normal convergence of the taylor series of f in z 2 over discs of radius arbitrarily close to 1 and uniform for y 1 suitably small thus f extends holomorphically to u where is a little shrunk as for theorem 3 5 where we have extension only to the side y 2 0 we follow the same lines the proof that boundedness implies continuity requires an extra argument since we are now working in the upper half disc at the boundary points im z 2 0 this is provided by the more general theorem 2 1 a direct proof based on the phragme n lindelo f priciple could be given in this way we get holomorphic extension to u we center now the taylor series of f with respect to z 2 at z 2 2 i 2 for and get that this series converges normally for z 2 in the disc 2 i 2 of center 2 i 2 and radius 2 and uniformly for z 1 belonging to compact subsets of i i i 0 for a suitable we next iterate and center the taylor series of the extension of f to the points j j or j j j 0 n so that n n 1 in this way we are able to extend f to the domains w i ii n v where v is a neighborhood of i i 2 in the z 2 plane by taking the union w we obtain a domain of extension which is a neighborhood of i 2 i 0 i next by a theorem by kashiwara cf 9 we get 8 l baracco g zampieri extension to a domain w i 2 i where is a conical neighborhood of the half line y 2 0 in r 2 4 proofs proof of theorem 3 4 by using iteration we may assume n 2 we will use the notations i 1 1 i 2 i i i 1 u c re 1 im im 0 i t i t 0 u u im 0 the statement being local we can suppose that f is defined and continuous in i 2 extends to x 2 x 2 and x 1 holomorphic with respect to and x 1 respectively we even assume that f extends indeed to discs of radius slightly bigger than 1 or x 2 a we first prove that there are an open interval i i and an open strip u i ii such that f is continuous in i and in u i cf 10 and 18 hence it is a continuous cr function therein we start from the proof of the continuity on i let kl x 1 i sup z 2 f x 1 z 2 l we note that kl kl 1 and that lkl i since for each x 1 sup z 2 f x 1 z 2 we claim that 4 1 kl is closed f is continuous on kl in fact let x 1 x o 1 with x 1 kl we want to show that then x o 1 kl we use the notation f z 2 f x 1 z 2 f x o 1 z 2 the sequence f is equicontinuous in a neighborhood of in fact remember that that f was supposed to be holomorphic for z 2 slightly bigger than 1 so the conclusion follows from the hypothesis of boundedness in addition to the cauchy inequalities we claim that f 0 otherwise by the equicontinuity there is a subsequence f k k which converges to a limit f 6 0 but this limit is holomorphic in and 0 in i a contradiction this proves the claim and thus 4 1 follows we can see now that by baire s theorem the union lkl being the whole i the sets kl must contain an open interval for large l also such an interval can be found in a neighborhood of any point it needs not to contain 0 but we may assume it by means of a small translation for the purpose of our proof thus we can assume that f extends as a continuous function on i holomorphic in z 2 hence it is a continuous cr function therein we pass now to prove that f is a continuous cr function on u i for this purpose we define jl x 2 f x 2 extends to y 1 1 l and f x 2 l in fact if x 2 x o 2 with x 2 jl then by boundedness there is a subsequence which converges to a holomorphic function on u 1 l this must be f xo 2 as before we have f x 2 l and f u 1 l il is continuous by baire s theorem we still conclude that for large l the set jl contains an open interval that we can suppose to be centered at 0 this concludes the proof of the claim separate real analyticity and cr extendibility 9 b at this point we apply the ajrapetyan henkin edge of the wedge theorem and con clude that f extends holomorphically to a domain of type since this is a crucial point here we give the outline of the proof which follows 21 we show first how to ex tend f for 0 im z 1 0 im z 2 in fact choose smooth functions yj e i 0 with supp y 1 0 supp y 2 2 and with unit mean value take j with 0 j j write y 1 y 1 2 y 2 and consider the discs axo which are the holomorphic extensions of xo t 0 y iy from e i to here t 0 is the hilbert transform normalized by the condition t 0 0 0 note that the boundaries of these discs corresponding to the values ei of the parameter are contained in the union of i and i also the set of their centers axo 0 xo i is the set described by 0 im z 1 0 im z 2 on the other hand f is uniformly approximated over the set of the boundaries by a sequence of polynomials according to the baouendi treves approximation theorem cf theorem 1 ch 13 of 4 this sequence is also convergent in the inside of these discs in particular in the set of their centers by the maximum principle the limit of the sequence provides the desired extension of f to the first quadrant 0 im z 1 0 im z 2 in the same way we prove extension to the other quadrants and conclude the proof of our claim c we notice now that f is continuous and cr on u i u i is foliated by the complex leaves x 2 u x 2 for x 2 i f extends to each leaf x 2 intersects i but then the propagation of the holomorphic extendibility of cr functions along complex leaves yields extension of f to an open domain u of c 2 for small we notice here that is swept by discs with boundary in the region where f is bounded and u by discs with boundary in the union of u i and where f is also bounded hence by maximum modulus principle f is bounded in u since by such an intervals i where f has different bounds we cover an open dense set d i we conclude that f is continuous up to y 0 over i d this remark will be crucial in the proof of the subsequent theorem 3 5 d we consider now the taylor series of f with respect to z 2 centered at z 2 0 4 2 z 2 f z 1 0 z 2 this represents a holomorphic function on u when x 1 is fixed in i this extends holomorphically for z 2 we write z 1 1 log z 2 f z 1 0 and note that these are subharmonic functions of z 1 we have 4 3 lim sup sup z 1 u z 1 log 10 l baracco g zampieri and hence in particular sup z 1 u z 1 l for some constant l and for any we also have 4 4 lim sup x 1 0 for x 1 i in 4 3 and 4 4 the domains and i should be arbitrarily little shrunk but then theorem 3 1 applies to the sequence of the s over the pair of half strips x 1 u it implies that for any 0 and 0 and for suitable we have sup x 1 i y 1 z 1 2 1 log y 1 we have in other words z 2 f z 1 0 1 e 2 y 1 1 let satisfy e 2 1 1 1 then the series 4 2 converges uniformly for z 1 on compact subsets of u i i i 0 normally for z 2 in 1 and its sum is therefore a holomorphic function on u 1 since we already know that this function extends to y 1 0 when z 2 then it is in fact holomorphic on u the proof is complete proof of theorem 3 5 it is not restrictive to assume n 2 i i and 2 i we may suppose that f is a continuous function on i 2 which extends holomorphically to x 1 and x 2 x 2 x 1 and x 2 in i we prove that it extends holomorphically to a domain i 2 i where is an open cone of r 2 around the positive y 2 axis e the first part of the proof follows the lines of theorem 3 4 we begin by noticing that f extends continuously to u i and to i for some the former is identical as in theorem 3 4 the latter is a consequence of theorem 2 1 we then apply the edge of the wedge and the propagation theorems and conclude that f extends holomorphically to u we note here that contains 2 i 2 the disc with center i 2 and radius 2 we will write instead of 2 in the following and therefore suppose that f extends to i f we consider now the taylor series of f with respect to z 2 centered at the point i for 4 5 z 2 f z 1 i z 2 this represents a holomorphic function on i when x 1 is fixed in i this extends holomorphically for z 2 i that is the radius of convergence in z 2 increases from to we write z 1 1 log z 2 f z 1 i and note that these are subharmonic functions of z 1 we have 4 6 lim sup sup z 1 u z 1 log separate real analyticity and cr extendibility 11 together with 4 7 lim sup x 1 log for x 1 i in 4 6 and 4 7 the domains u and i should be arbitrarily little shrunk but then theorem 3 1 applies to the sequence of the s over the pair of half strips u it implies that for any 0 and 0 and for suitable we have sup x 1 i y 1 z 1 log log y 1 2 we have in other words 4 8 z 2 f z 1 i 1 e 2 1 y 1 define by log 1 2 log we note that under the condition y 1 we have e 2 y 1 1 1 and hence the term in the right of 4 8 is 1 1 1 that is the radius of convergence of 4 5 is 1 the convergence is normal for z 2 satisfying z 2 i uniform in z 1 satisfying x 1 i y 1 in fact by repeating the argument of theorem 3 1 in the half disc y 1 0 it is also uniform for y 1 hence by letting 0 it remains well defined a holomorphic function on i ii i that we will denote by f we can of course move backwords and center the taylor series at i instead of i g in the next step we center the taylor expansion of f at 2 i by the same argument as in f in which we apply theorem 3 1 to a covering of u by rescaled discs x 1 we get extension of f to the domain i ii 2 2 i after finitely many say n steps we get n n 1 we can also move backwords and get n n 1 we have thus obtained a holomorphic extension f to a domain of the type i ii n nj n j i note that the union of discs in the second term above contains an open neighborhood v of i i we move now to 0 we then get a holomorphic function f defined on the domain i ii n v we show now that f is also defined for y 1 0 that it extends to a wedge w i 2 i where is a conic neighborhood of the axis y 2 0 and that it is uniformly continuous 12 l baracco g zampieri at y 0 with limit f we start by remarking that f is defined from the beginning over u where it is uniformly continuous up to i i with limit f f z 1 z 2 y 1 0 y 2 0 f x 1 x 2 for x 1 x 2 i i in particular f x 1 z 2 y 2 0 f x 1 x 2 for x 2 i but it then follows from the iden tity principle for holomorphic functions f x 1 z 2 f x 1 z 2 for z 2 v thus f is defined also for y 1 0 and is wherever defined an extension of f x 1 z 2 for values of z 1 such that y 1 0 in particular it is an extension of f to i ii n v next by a theorem by kashiwara cf 9 f extends to a wedge w as before described at this point f has at its own right a generalized boundary value on the other hand by what we remarked before d of the proof of theorem 4 1 f is uniformly continuous up to y 0 over i d where d is open dense in i in particular for any xo 2 i there are neigborhoods b a xo 2 such that b a d thus f is indeed uniformly continuous according to theorem 2 4 and it has limit f at i 2 the proof is complete proof of corollary 3 6 we let n 2 and suppose that f extends to x 1 and z 2 z 2 for any x 1 i and z 2 respectively for y 2 i let i y 2 i iy 2 the idea of the proof is to apply theorem 3 2 with i 2 replaced by i i y 2 but we have to overcome the problem that f i i y 2 is not known to be continuous to this end we define jl y 2 z 2 i y 2 f z 2 is holomorphic in u 1 l and sup z 1 u 1 l f z 1 z 2 l we can then see that f i jl y 2 is continuous if we manage to prove this then f will be in fact continuous on u jl y 2 for some 1 l by theorem 2 1 and this will suffice to carry out our proof to prove this claim we write for any pair of points x 2 iy 2 x 2 iy 2 in jl y 2 and x 1 x 1 in i f x 1 x 2 iy 2 f x 1 x 2 iy 2 f x 1 x 2 iy 2 f x 1 x 2 iy 2 f x 1 x 2 iy 2 f x 1 x 2 iy 2 now the first term is small for x 1 x 1 small and uniformly with respect to x 2 by cauchy inequalities and by the uniform bound f l the second is small for x 2 x 2 small since f x 1 is holomorphic henceforth continuous references 1 r ajrapetyan g
