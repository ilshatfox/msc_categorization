references 85 introduction the main purpose of this article is to prove necessary and sufficient nu merical conditions for equisingularity and equinormalizability of families of isolated non normal singularities in order to put these into perspective we start with a survey of classical results for families of reduced curve singulari ties partly from a non classical point of view the main new results concern deformations of isolated non normal singularities we define a invariant and a invariant for these singularities und use them to prove necessary and sufficient numerical conditions for equinormalizability and weak equinormal izability we determine also the number of connected components of the milnor fibre for families of generically reduced curves we investigate the topological behavior of the milnor fibre and characterize topological trivial ity of such families using and finally we state some open problems and conjectures a germ z z of an arbitrary complex space z is said to have an iso lated non normal singularity inns for short if u r z is normal for some neighbourhood u of z e g if z is an isolated singularity of z we allow in particular that z is not reduced at z which is a natural assumption since this happens necessarily for fibres of families where the total space has low depth 2 see st 15 for interesting examples of deformations of isolated non normal singularities for z z an inns we introduce a invariant z z and a invariant z z which take care of the embedded component of z at z these invariants generalize the definitions given in bug 80 for reduced and in brg 90 for non reduced curve singularities and we continue to call z z the milnor number of z z if z z is a curve singularity the main general result is that a deformation f x x c 0 of an inns x 0 x admits a simultaneous normalization iff for a good representa tive f x t xt is constant for t t and if the milnor fibre xt t 6 0 has no isolated points this generalizes the well known result of teissier for deformations of reduced curve singularities and of br cker and the author for non reduced isolated curve singularities moreover we study the problem of simultaneous weak normalization where the fibres admit a simultaneous weak normalization which has not been considered so far we prove among others that a family of reduced isolated non normal singularities admits a simultaneous weak normalization iff xt xt is constant we apply the general results to families of curves and study several eq uisingularity conditions in particular topological triviality it is known by bug 80 that in a family of reduced curve singularities with section the constancy of xt along is equivalent to topological triviality we show by an example that this is no longer the case for families of non reduced curve singularities the reason is that in a family where the special fibre has an embedded component the milnor fibre may become disconnected even if xt is constant we provide an algebraically computable formula for the number of connected components for arbitrary families of isolated non normal singularities the nice thing about is that in a family of generically reduced curves xt is constant iff the topological euler charac teristic of xt is constant moreover we prove that a family with section is topologically trivial iff xt t and the number of branches r xt t are constant and that this is equivalent to xt being connected and xt t being constant we give now an overview of the different sections of the paper section 1 reviews the classical characterizations of equisingular families of plane curve singularities these studies go back to oskar zariski s studies in equisingu larity in the 1960 ties in connection with his attempts to prove resolution of singularities by induction on the dimension we review the basic results by oskar zariski bernard teissier and l du ng tra ng 3 in section 3 we study equinormalizable deformations of a reduced plane curve singularity c 0 cn 0 and in connection with this the constant stratum in the semiuniversal deformation of c 0 the non classical approach here is that we consider deformations of the parametrization of c 0 instead of deformations of the equation of c 0 deformations of the parametrization are much easier and the main result taken from gls 07 is that the semiuniversal deformation of the parametrization is obtained by pulling back to the normalization of the constant stratum of c f theorem 3 1 in section 4 we reconsider equisingular deformations es deformations of a reduced plane curve singularity c 0 by using again deformations of the parametrization as developed in gls 07 this leads to a description of the semiuniveral es deformation of the parametrization which is as simple and explicit computable as the semiuniveral of c 0 itself theorem 4 2 the parametric approach provides also an easy proof of jonathan wahl s result that the constant stratum in the semiuniversal deformation of c 0 is smooth theorem 4 6 the presentation of our new results starts in section 5 we introduce the invariant which measures the embedded component the invariant and the invariant for isolated non normal singularities definition 5 2 we describe the weak normalization of an inns and characterize the class of weakly normal inns by the minimum of the invariant moreover we give some formulas which are useful for the computation of the new invariants and elaborate this in an example including the singular code example 5 8 section 6 contains the general concepts of simultaneous normalizations and equinormalizability and we prove some consequences for maps that ad mit a simultaneous normalization moreover we review the more recent results by chiang hsieh lipman and kolla r who treat simultaneous nor malizations over an arbitrary normal resp weakly normal base space hung jen chiang hsieh and joseph lipman reconsidered in 2006 teissier s results and in addition families of projective varieties replacing the con stancy of delta by that of the hilbert polynomial theorem 6 9 in 2009 ja nos kolla r proved the existence of a fine moduli space for the functor of simultaneous normalization of a projective morphism theorem 6 13 thus generalizing the results of chiang hsieh and lipman the main new outcomes are presented from section 7 on and later in section 7 we characterize simultaneous normalization of 1 parametric fam 4 ilies f x x c 0 of isolated non normal singularities mentioned at the beginning of this introduction we need partial normalizations of the restriction of f to subspaces of x which we call moderations the intro duction of moderations unifies the proof of the main results of this section the first main result is a local and global generalization to families of inns of the classical constant criterion theorem 0 1 cf theorem 7 17 theorem 7 19 1 let f x x c 0 be flat with x 0 x an inns of dimension 1 and f x t a good representative then f is equinormalizable if and only if f is constant and xt has no isolated points for t 6 0 2 let f x t be a flat morphism of complex spaces with t a 1 dimensional complex manifold such that the non normal locus of f is finite over t then f is equinormalizable iff xt is constant on t and the 1 dimensional part of x is smooth and does not meet the higher dimensional components of x we like to mention that we do not need to assume that the fibres are equidimensional as this is the case in cl 06 and ko 11 the only necessary topological condition is that the fibres have no isolated points in section 8 we prove a connectedness result for the milnor fibre of an arbitrary morphism f x x c 0 theorem 0 2 cf theorem 8 2 corollary 8 4 let f x x c 0 be a morphism of complex germs f x t a good representative and f xt t 6 0 the milnor fibre of f 1 if x 0 x is reduced then f is connected 2 if x x is irreducible and if there exist points y x 0 arbitrary close to x such that x 0 y is reduced then f is irreducible this a joint result with bobadilla and hamm we prove 1 under a weaker assumption in proposition 8 8 we use this to determine an algebraically computable formula for the number of connected components of the milnor fibre of a family of inns moreover in this section we study constant families of inns and give in particular a numerical criterion for simultaneous weak normalization 5 theorem 0 3 cf theorem 8 7 let f x x c 0 be flat with x 0 x a reduced inns of dimension 1 f x t a good representative and x x the weak normalization of x then xt xt is constant is a weak normalization of f i e f f x t is flat with weakly normal fibres and the restriction t f 1 t xt is the weak normalization of xt for t t the application of the general results of section 7 and 8 to families of generically reduced curves and to the study of several equisingularity condi tions in particular topological triviality is presented in section 9 the main results are the following theorem 0 4 cf theorem 9 1 corollary 9 2 let f x x c 0 be flat with x 0 x a generically reduced curve singularity and f x t a good representative then the following holds 1 x 0 xt 1 xt for t t 2 the following are equivalent i xt b 0 xt is constant ii b 1 xt 0 iii each connected component of xt is contractible this shows that the definition of the milnor number for generically re duced curves with arbitrary non reduced embedded points has good topo logical properties if the family has a singular section we can say more theorem 0 5 cf theorem 9 3 corollary 9 8 let f x x c 0 be flat x 0 x a generically reduced curve singu larity and c 0 x x a section of f such that xt r t is smooth 1 the following are equivalent i f x t is topologically trivial ii x 0 and xt are embedded topologically equivalent for t t iii x x is pure 2 dimensional and f x t admits a weak si multaneous resolution 6 iv x x is pure 2 dimensional and xt t and r x t are constant v xt is constant and xt is connected for t t 2 f admits a strong simultaneous resolution i v hold and mt xt t is constant in example 9 11 we give examples to show that is in general not semicontinuous and that constant does not imply topological triviality if x 0 x is not reduced we finish the article with some comments open problems and conjectures in section 10 the appendix in section 11 contains notations and definitions about de formations of complex spaces and maps and which are particularly useful for understanding the relation between deformations of the equation and de formations of the parametrization moreover we fix the notion of a good representative of a morphism of germs to be used throughout this article for all results we give either full proves or precise references hoping that this rather long article may be useful as a reference source acknowlegment i would like to thank j bobadilla and h hamm for the cooperation in proving theorem 8 2 and both as well as j j ballesteros l du ng tr ng j lipman and j snoussi for additional references and fruitful discussions 1 equisingularity for plane curve singularities in a series of three papers studies in equisingularity i ii iii cf zai 65 zaii 65 zaiii 68 published in 1965 and 1968 oscar zariski initiated the study of equisingular families of algebroid hypersurfaces over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 the motivation behind this study was the idea to prove resolution of singularities by projection and by induction on the dimension see also za 77 and li 00 the rough and much simplified idea is as follows let x be an r dimensional hypersurface and consider a generic projection of x onto a k dimensional smooth space s then the fibres xs s s of this projection are k codimensional hypersurfaces which we know to resolve by induction 7 for each individual s s if the family xs s s is sufficiently equisin gular in the sense that for a given point x 0 xs the singularities of the nearby fibres are of the same type as the singularity of xs x 0 then the procedure to resolve the singularities of a single fibre xs should resolve the nearby fibres simultaneously and hence the singularities of x in the above cited papers zariski considered the case that dims dimx 1 and that the projection f x s has a section s x such that w s is the smooth singular locus of x in this case the fi bres xs are plane curves and zariski gave a precise definition of the intuitive idea of equisingularity he defined equisingularity of x along w i e for families of plane curve singularities xs s and proved several equivalent characterizations one of these characterizations is that f x s admits a simultaneous resolution by blowing up x at w such that the blown up fam ily admits again a simultaneous resolution by blowing up sections etc until the special fibre and then all nearby fibres are resolved hence if the hy persurface x has a smooth singular locus and if an equisingular projection f x s exists then the singularities of x can be resolved unfortu nately such an equisingular projection does not always exist and resolution of singularities is in general not possible by this method it was heisuke hironaka who proved the resolution of singularities in general for arbitrary algebraic varieties over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 in 1964 by blowing up smooth centres and by an ingenious induction which reduces certain invariants of the singularities this is a deep result for which hironaka received the fields medal in 1970 nowadays there exist simpler algorithmic proofs and even implementations e g in singular see fp 13 in dgps 15 for a historical account of resolution in characteristic 0 see ha 00 the resolution of singularities over fields of positive characteristic is an important and still open problem for varieties of dimension bigger than 3 see ha 10 for an overview independant of resolution of singularities zariski s studies in equisingu larity had great influence on the development of singularity theory we give a short account of equisingularity for families of plane curves which is of interest to us and which motivated the study of simultaneous normalization to be dicussed in the subsequent sections in the following we mainly work in the category of complex analytic space and germs zariski defines the equivalence of two reduced plane curve singularities in three different ways which he proves to be equivalent by induction on the number of successive blowing ups needed to resolve the singularities 8 we recall his definition of a equivalence let c 0 and d 0 be two reduced curve singularities in c 2 0 if c 0 is smooth resp an ordinary node i e analytically isomorphic to x y 0 then d 0 is equivalent to c 0 if d 0 is smooth resp an ordinary node denote by c 0 the minimal number of blowing ups needed to obtain a good embedded resolution of c 0 this means that the reduced total transform has only ordinary nodes as singularities c 0 0 means that c 0 is either smooth or has an ordinary node now let c 0 0 and assume that for curve singularities 0 with 0 c 0 the notion of equivalence has already been defined denote by c the strict transform of c 0 obtained by blowing up 0 c 2 and let t denote the number of connected components of c corresponding to the different tangents of c 0 let 01 0 t be the intersection points of c with the exceptional divisor e and denote the germs of c at 0 by c 0 then c 0 is smaller than c 0 now zariski s definition in zai 65 is as follows an a equivalence between c 0 and d 0 is a bijection between the set of branches ci 0 of c 0 and di 0 of d 0 i 1 r satisfying i is tangentially stable i e ci 0 and cj 0 have the same tangent iff this holds for ci 0 and cj 0 for any i j ii if di 0 ci 0 then mt di 0 mt ci 0 i 1 r iii the induced bijection between the branches of c 0 and of d 0 is an a equivalence zariski introduces also b equivalence and formal equivalence and proves in zai 65 that all three definitions are equivalent we call any of these equivalent conditions zariski equivalence the following theorem gives other characterizations which are more intu itive theorem 1 1 zariski let c 0 and d 0 be two reduced plane curve singularities the following are equivalent 1 c 0 and d 0 are zariski equivalent 2 there exists a bijection between the set of branches ci 0 of c 0 and di 0 of d 0 i 1 r such that 9 i ci 0 and ci 0 have the same puiseux pairs for i 1 r ii the intersection multiplicity of ci 0 and cj 0 coincides with the intersection multiplicity of ci 0 and cj 0 for all i 6 j 3 c 0 and d 0 are embedded topologically equivalent we say that two embedded complex germs x x cn x and y y cn y with representatives x resp y in cn are embedded topologi cally equivalent if there exists a sufficiently small 0 0 such that for each 0 0 there exists a homeomorphism h b x b y with h x y and h x y where b x z cn z x is called a milnor ball for sufficiently small since topological maps disregard the non reduced structure embedded topological equivalence is a condition about the respective reductions the equivalence of the three characterizations is basically due to zariski zaiii 68 and za 71 using the theory of saturation see also te 75 2 appendix recall that for a convergent power series f c x 1 xn or for a holomorphic function germ f cn 0 c 0 and analytic coordinates x 1 xn the milnor number f is defined as f dimcc x 1 xn f x 1 f xn if the power series f c x y defines a reduced plane curve singularity c 0 f 1 0 0 then and are related by the very useful formula of john milnor cf mi 68 c 0 2 c 0 r c 0 1 where r c 0 is the number of branches of c 0 and c 0 dimc n oc 0 oc 0 with n c c the normalization of c the delta invariant of c 0 see definiton 5 2 for a generalization it is a non trivial fact proved by l du ng tra ng in le 74 that f depends only on the topological type of c 0 c 2 0 and therefore we write c 0 we consider now a 1 parameter deformation c 0 c 0 of a reduced plane curve singularity c 0 c 2 0 together with a section c 0 c 0 10 theorem 1 2 zariski teissier l lejeune ramanujam timo urian let c 0 c 0 a deformation of the plane curve singularity c 0 with section and c s a good representative then the following conditions are equivalent 1 the germs cs s are pairwise zariski equivalent for s s 2 the milnor number cs s is constant for s s 3 the delta invariant cs s and the number of branches r cs s are constant for s s 4 the multiplicity mt cs s is constant and c s admits a simul taneous embedded resolution by blowing up s which results in a family of multigerms of plane curve singularities over s along finitely many sections with constant multiplicities these sections can be in ductively blown up until the special fibre c 0 0 c 0 and then all fibres cs s b 0 are resolved with normal crossings of the reduced total transform 5 the germs cs s are pairwise embedded topologically equivalent for s s 6 c s is induced by a topologically trivial family of functions fs c 2 0 c 0 s s the proof theorem 1 2 is due to several people 1 5 and 4 1 are due to zariski see theorem 2 1 while 1 4 is due to teissier see te 75 2 5 6 was proved by timourian ti 77 for a precise statement see below while 6 5 is trivial 5 2 was proved by l du ng tra ng le 74 and 2 5 by l and ramamanujam lr 76 2 3 is due to teissier te 76 and 3 2 follows from milnors formula relating and above the implication 2 1 for irreducible curves was first proved in a short note by monique lejeune l du ng tr ng and bernard teissier in llt 70 for a proof of several further characterizations and for some historical remarks see te 76 theorem 5 3 1 and te 77 3 7 the result of timourian has been generalized by bobadilla who introduces in bo 13 the notion of cuts and a general technique for topological trivi alization the notion of good representative is explained in the appendix remark 1 3 let x 0 cn 0 be an isolated hypersurface singularity and x s c a good representative of a 1 parameter deformation of 11 x 0 without a given section but with constant milnor number x 0 xs x xs xs x for all s s then there exists a section s x of such that s is the only singular point of xs for all s s the uniqueness of the singular point in xs was proved by fulvio lazzeri la 74 and gabrielov ga 74 the existence of a section by teissier te 77 we explain what topologically trivial family of functions means for the good representative c s there exists a holomorphic function f b s c such that c is the hypersurface f 1 0 b s and for s s we have cs f 1 s 0 with fs f s b c we call fs s s an embedded topologically trivial family of functions if there exists a neighbourhood u of 0 0 in b s and a homeomorphism h u b s h 0 s 0 s such that the following diagram commutes u h g b s f 0 idyyss s s s s s s s c s with g z s f z s s the restriction of h induces a homeomorphism c g 1 0 s f 0 id 1 0 c 0 s making the c s an embedded topologically trivial family of hypersurface singularities respecting the section s 0 s this implies several weaker notions of topological triviality in particular that c s is non embedded topologically trivial where a family c s resp with section is called topologically trivial if there exists a homeomorphism h c c 0 s over s resp s t h s 0 s moreover setting us h 1 b s and hs us b the induced homeomorphism then fs f 0 hs that is f 0 and fs are topologically right equivalent for s s it follows from lr 76 that for s t s the germ cs 0 and ct 0 in c 2 0 are embedded topological equivalent with the same milnor ball in c 2 2 constant and constant families of reduced curves in this section we consider families of not necessarily plane reduced curves we give an overview of numerical characterizations of simultane 12 ous normalization due to bernard teissier and hung jen chiang hsieh and joseph lipman and of topologial triviality due to ragnar buchweitz and the author of this article in the late 1970 ies bernard teisssier reconsidering the work of zariski and hironaka studied again simultaneous resolutions of singularities and he initiated the study of simultaneous normalization note that for a reduced curve singularity c 0 the normalization n c 0 c 0 where 0 denotes the finite set n 1 0 provides a resolution of c 0 since c 0 is smooth however in contrast to the previous section where we con sidered embedded resolutions of plane curve singularities the normalization gives only an abstract non embedded resolution even if c 0 is plane teissier introduces in te 76 several notions of simultaneous resolution which we recall definition 2 1 let f x x s 0 be a flat morphism of complex germs with reduced fibres and s 0 reduced 1 f admits a very weak simultaneous resolution if for sufficiently small representatives there exists a morphism x x such that i is proper and bimeromorphic 1 ii f f x s is flat with non singular fibres iii the induced map s x s xs on the fibres is a resolution of singularities of xs for s s 2 f admits a weak simultaneous resolution along the image w 0 s 0 of a section s 0 x x of f if in addition to the properties i iii of 1 the following holds with w 1 w iv the induced morphism g f w w s satisfies for each x w there exists an isomorphism h w red x g 1 0 red x s 0 such that g w red x pr h with pr the projection onto s 0 1 a morphism is bimeromorphic if there exists a nowhere dense analytic subset a x such that 1 a is nowhere dense in x and x r 1 a x ra is an isomorphism a subset a of a complex space x is called nowhere dense if its closure has no interior points by ritt s lemma gr 84 chapter 5 3 1 an analytic set a is nowhere dense if and only if dim a x dim x x for all x a 13 3 f admits a strong simultaneous resolution if with the notions of 2 there exists an isomorphism h w x g 1 0 x s 0 such that g pr h 4 if 1 i holds and if ii f is flat with normal fibres iii s x s xs is the normalization of xs for s s then x x is called a simultaneous normalization of f note that a simultaneous resolution of a family may be considered as a deformation of the resolution of the special fibre that blows down to a deformation of the special fibre this problem is quite subtle and was studied for surface singularities by mike artin egbert brieskorn jonathan wahl and others including henry laufer in la 73 for families of reduced plane curve singularities we have the following numerical characterization of strong weak and very weak simultaneous resolution proved by teissier in te 75 theorem ii 5 3 1 resp in te 76 theorem i 1 3 2 and zariski the equivalence between iii and iv below theorem 2 2 teissier zariski let f x x s 0 be a deformation with section s 0 x x of the reduced plane curve singularity x 0 x with s 0 smooth then the following are equivalent for good representatives i the milnor number xs s is constant for s s ii the delta invariant xs s and the number of branches r xs s are constant for s s iii f admits a weak simultaneous resolution iv f admits a strong simultaneous resolution for simultaneous normalization we have the following result by teissier theorem 2 3 teissier let f x x c 0 be a deformation of the not necessarily plane reduced curve singularity x 0 x then the following are equivalent for a good representative f x s i the delta invariant xs y xs xs y is constant for s s 14 ii f admits a very weak simultaneous resolution x x iii f admits a simultaneous normalization x x moreover in this case x is necessarily the normalization of x theorem 2 3 says that a flat family f x s c of reduced curves without section admits a simultaneous normalization iff the function s 7 xs is constant on s teissier considers in te 76 i 1 3 2 also families over higher dimensional base spaces s and states the same result for s normal attributing the proof to michel raynaud it was observed much later by chiang hsieh and lipman in cl 06 that the proof contained a gap which they closed theorem 2 4 teissier raynaud chiang hsieh lipman let f x x s 0 be a flat morphism of complex germs with s 0 normal x x equidimensional and with fibre x 0 x a reduced curve sin gularity then f admits a simultaneous normalization x x iff xs is constant for s s for a good representative f x s moreover is the normalization of x remark 2 5 1 the proof for higher dimensional base spaces is surpris ingly much more difficult then for 1 dimensional base spaces chiang hsieh and lipman had to use a global argument namely the existences of the quot scheme for coherent sheaves 2 the proof in cl 06 is given for families of schemes over a perfect field and then the authors derive the complex analytic case from that a simplified direct proof along the same lines in the complex analytic setting is given in gls 07 ii 2 6 example 2 6 let x x y s c 3 x 2 y 3 sy 2 0 and f x 0 c 0 the projection on the s axis then x 0 x y c 2 x 2 y 3 0 is the ordinary cusp and xs x y c 2 x 2 y 2 y s 0 has 1 singular point at 0 which is an ordinary node if s 6 0 hence f does not admit a strong simultaneous resolution according to theorem 1 2 note that r x 0 0 1 while r xs 0 2 for s 6 0 however the family is constant as xs 0 1 for all s by theorem 2 3 f admits a simultaneous normalization with total space the normaliza tion x of x we can compute x as x y x s t c 4 x ty y 2 ys tx y t s 2 x 2 y 3 sy 2 0 15 with normalization map n x x the projection to the first three coor dinates computed with normal lib glp 15 from singular dgps 15 x is nonsingular in fact isomorphic to y t 2 0 by eliminating x hence normal and the singular point 0 0 s xs has two preimage points 0 0 s x in xs for s 6 0 we consider now topological triviality of families of reduced but not necessarily plane curves a key role plays the milnor number for a reduced curve singularity c 0 cn 0 introduced by buchweitz and the author in bug 79 and bug 80 it is defined as c 0 dimc c 0 doc 0 where c is the dualizing sheaf of c moreover it was shown in bug 80 proposition 1 2 1 that c 0 2 c 0 r c 0 1 and that c 0 0 iff c 0 is smooth now we consider a situation as in theorem 3 3 but with being constant the key result is the following theorem 4 2 2 in bug 80 proposition 2 7 let f x s be a good representative of a deformation f x x c 0 of a reduced curve singularity x 0 x cn 0 the following holds for s s 1 xs is connected 2 x 0 x xs dimch 1 xs c 1 xs 3 x 0 x xs x 0 x xs 0 here h 1 xs c is the first singular cohomology group of the topological space xs and the topological euler characteristic an easy consequence is the following theorem 4 2 4 in bug 80 theorem 2 8 buchweitz greuel let f x s be as in proposition 2 7 then the following are equivalent 1 xs is constant for s s 2 xs and r xs y xs r xs y are constant for s s 3 h 1 xs 0 for s s 16 4 xs is contractible for s s here r xs y r xs y 1 which is 0 at smooth points y of xs note that if x 0 x is not planar then xs constant does in general not imply that xs has only 1 singular point or that xs is homeomorphic to x 0 for examples see bug 80 therefore one has to assume the existence of a section s x such xs r s is non singular which follows from xs s being constant theorem 2 9 buchweitz greuel let f x s be as in proposition 2 7 and assume that there is a section s x of f such that xs r s is smooth for s s the following conditions are equivalent 1 xs s is constant for s s 2 xs s and r xs s are constant for s s 3 dimch 1 xs c 0 for s s 4 f admits a weak simultaneous resolution 5 x 0 x and xs s are embedded topologically equivalent in cn 0 for s s 6 the family f x s with section is topologically trivial the proof is given in bug 80 theorem 5 3 1 for the definition of em bedded topologically equivalent and topologically trivial see the previous section the following corollary is well known it is an immediate consequence of theorem 2 9 although it was not explicitely mentioned in bug 80 corollary 2 10 f admits a strong simultaneous resolution iff xs s and mt xs s are constant proof by theorem 2 9 we have to show that a weak simultaneous resolution is strong iff mt xs s is constant this is proved for generically reduced curve singularities in lemma 9 10 by a result of teissier te 76 strong simultaneous resolution is also equiv alent to the validity of the whitney conditions a and b for the pair x r w w moreover the whitney conditions to hold is equivalent to 17 xs s and mt xs s being constant this was proved by brian on galligo and granger in bgg 80 based on bug 80 where the authors con sider further equisingularity conditions see section 10 1 for an overview the results of this section are generalized to flat families of generically reduced curves in section 7 for simultaneous normalization and in section 9 for topological triviality 3 deformation of the normalization and the constant stratum in this section we study equinormalizable deformations of a reduced plane curve singularity c 0 c 2 0 and in connection with this the constant stratum of a deformation this is done by considering the deformation of the normalization resp of the parametrization of c 0 which is easier than the corresponding deformation of the equation of c 0 the main result is a theorem published first in gls 07 saying that the restriction of the semiuniversal deformation of c 0 to the constant stratum is after pull back to the normalization of isomorphic to the semiuniversal deformation of the normalization map n c 0 c 0 this gives not only a nice desription of constant deformations it shows also that is irreducible with smooth normalization let c 0 s 0 be a deformation of the plane curve singularity c 0 over an arbitrary complex germ s 0 and c s a good repre sentative we denote by sing the points in c where is not regular and call sing s the discriminant of and for k 0 k s s cs k k s s cs k since the fibres cs of have only finitely many isolated singularities cs and cs are finite numbers and the restriction of to sing is a finite morphism the discriminant of is therefore a closed analytic subset of s which we endow with the fitting structure cf gls 07 def i 1 4 5 by gls 07 prop ii 2 57 the sets k resp k are closed analytic subsets of s which we equip here with the reduced structure the smallest 18 of these analytic sets are those with k c 0 resp k c 0 called the constant stratum resp the constant stratum of and are denoted by resp the strata k are also called the severi strata of although we do not need it here we like to mention that carries a natural not necessarily reduced scheme structure since it can be interpreted as the stratum in s parametrizing all equisingular deformations of c 0 that can be induced from cf gls 07 section ii 2 1 moreover it was recently shown in cms 16 that all severi strata are defined by equations coming from a natural symplectic form on s we come now to the description of by using deformations of the normalization map n c 0 c 0 cf appendix we have the forgetful functor from deformations of n c 0 c 0 to deformations of c 0 or in other words from deformations of the normalization of c 0 to deformations of the equation of c 0 the following theorem explains the relation between deformations of the normalization of c 0 and constant deformations of the equation of c 0 c 2 0 for this we recall the seminuniversal deformation of the equation of c 0 let f oc 2 0 define c 0 and g 1 1 g 2 g oc 2 0 be a basis of the tjurina algebra tf c x y f f x f y with f dimc tf the tjurina number of f define with s s 1 s d 0 z s c 2 c 0 f z i 1 gi z si 0 and let d 0 bc 0 c 0 be the projection on the second factor then is the seminuniversal defor mation of c 0 with base space bc 0 and we call for a good representa tive the analytic subsets resp of bc the constant stratum of c 0 resp the constant stratum of c 0 it consists of those points s bc such that the fibre ds satisfies ds c 0 resp ds c 0 the following theorem from gls 07 theorem ii 2 59 is the main result of this section a short summary of the deformation theoretic background is given in the appendix 19 theorem 3 1 greuel lossen shustin let n c 0 c 0 be the normalization of the reduced plane curve singularity c 0 1 if c 0 c 0 b c c 0 denotes the semiuniversal deformation of n then its base space b c c 0 is smooth of dimension 2 let d 0 bc 0 be the semiuniversal deformation of c 0 then the forgetful transformation def c c def c and the versality of d 0 bc 0 imply the existence of a morphism b c c 0 bc 0 satisfying i the image of is the constant stratum 0 of c 0 and b c c 0 0 is the normalization of 0 ii the pull back of the semiuniversal deformation d 0 bc 0 of c 0 via is isomorphic to c 0 b c c 0 and hence lifts to the semiuniversal deformation c 0 c 0 b c c 0 of the normalization n of c 0 3 i the constant stratum 0 bc 0 is irreducible of dimen sion and has a smooth normalization ii s is a smooth point of iff each singularity of the fibre ds has only smooth branches iii there exists an open dense set u such that each fibre ds s u has only ordinary nodes as singularities remark 3 2 1 the existence of follows from deformation theoretic properties in general it is unique only up to first order however in our situation it is unique since it is the normalization of 0 2 statement 3 i and ii was proved before with global methods by stephan diaz and joseph harris in dh 88 in 1988 using an earlier result by arbarello and cornalba theorem 3 1 above was first pub lished in gls 07 although the result was already known to the author of this article since 1988 he scetched a proof since then on several con ferences remark 3 3 for the full proof of theorem 3 1 we refer to gls 07 but we like to make a few comments on the proof 20 1 we use at several places that c 0 is a plane curve singularity we need this assumption to prove that b c c is smooth the proof for this is indirect by showing first that the semiuniversal deformation of the normalization n c 0 c 0 is isomorphic to the semiuniversal deformation of the parametrization j n c 0 c 2 0 with j c 0 c 2 0 an embedding of c 0 in fact any deformation of the the parametrization can be lifted to a deformation of the pair n j c 0 n c 0 j c 2 0 see gls 07 prop ii 2 23 this is in general not true for non plane curve singularities since the parametrization is a morphism between smooth multi germs its semiuniversal deformation is given by varying the coefficients of without any flatness condition and hence its base space is smooth cf gls 07 theorem ii 2 38 this is described in the next section 2 another place where we use that c 0 is planar is the proof that b c c 0 0 is the normalization it is well known that for a generic point s the fibre ds has only ordinary nodes as singularities statement 3 iii a local computation for a node d 0 shows that its constant stratum is smooth a reduced point and isomorphic to b d d 0 by openness of versality for deformations of c 0 and of c 0 c 0 it follows that s is smooth of codimension 4 deformation of the parametrization and the constant stratum we come back to equisingular deformations or es deformation for short of a reduced plane curve singularity c 0 c 2 0 here we describe it not by deformation of the equation as in section 1 but by deformation of the parametrization this approach is very natural and much easier since deformations of the parametrization are almost effortless to describe both concepts can be defined for deformations over non reduced base spaces giv ing a deformation functor in the sense of michel schlessinger sch 68 see also gls 07 app c and a canonical not necessarily reduced scheme struc ture on the base space of its semiuniversal deformation when we compare es deformations of the parametrization with es deformations of the equation the main problems arise in connection with deformations over non reduced base spaces 21 without going through the formalities for which we refer to gls 07 section 2 3 let us describe deformations of the parametrization in concrete terms consider the commutative diagram of complex multi germs c 0 n c 0 j c 2 0 with j the given embedding n the normalization and the parametrization of c 0 if c 0 c 1 0 cr 0 is the decomposition of c 0 into ir reducible components then c 0 c 1 01 cr 0 r is a multigerm with ci 0 i c 0 mapped via n onto ci 0 inducing the normaliza tion of the branch ci 0 we fix local coordinates x y of c 2 0 and ti of ci 0 i i 1 r identifying it with c 0 then the parametrization i i 1 r is given by r holomorphic map germs i c 0 c 2 0 ti 7 xi ti yi ti parametrizing the branch ci 0 since any deformation of the smooth germs ci 0 i and c 2 0 is trivial a deformation of the parametrization over a complex germ s 0 with sections is given by a cartesian diagram r i 1 ci 0 i c 0 c 0 r i 1 c s 0 m 0 c 2 0 m 0 c 2 s 0 pr 0 s 0 dd s 0 with pr the projection compatible sections and and a morphism i i 1 r c 0 r i 1 ci 0 i m

i e s 0 s and i s 0 s where 0 always denotes the origin of the corresponding germ the deformation is thus given by two holomorphic map germs xi ti s xi ti ai ti s ai ti 0 0 yi ti s yi ti bi ti s bi ti 0 0 setting ord i min ord xi ti ord yi ti we call the deformation equimultiple along the trivial sections and i if for i 1 r ord i min ordti xi ti s ordti yi ti s here ordtx t s denotes the t order of x i e the lowest degree of non zero terms of x t s considered as power series in t with coefficients in c s the definition makes sense also for non reduced base spaces for a re duced base space s equimultiple means that the multiplicity of the branch of the plane curve singularity parametrized by ti 7 xi ti s yi ti s is independent of s s we describe now equisingular deformations of the parametrization of c 0 we denote by m c 2 a small neighbourhood of 0 and consider an infinitely near point p m including 0 m of c 0 that is m is obtained from m by a finite squence of blowing up points with c the strict transform of c and p an intersection point of c with the exceptional divisor of the blowing up then the germ c p is the strict transform of a collection of branches of c 0 denoted by cp 0 let c p 1 cp 0 c 0 and p c p c 2 0 be the restriction of since cp 0 and c p have the same normalization c p p factors through c p and the induced map p c p c p m p c 2 0 is a parametrization of c p definition 4 1 a deformation with section of over a complex germ s 0 is called equisingular or an es deformation of if the fol lowing holds 23 i is equimultiple along ii for each infinitely near point p of c 0 induces an equimultiple deformation p c p s 0 m p s 0 of the parametrization p along some section p compatible with p i i 0 p iii the collection p p p p infinitely near to c 0 is compatible with blowing ups relating two infinitely near points iv if m p is obtained by a single blowing up of m p then the source of p is the blow up of the source of p along the section p we denote the category of es deformations of over s 0 by def es c 0 c 2 0 s 0 or by def es s 0 where the morphisms are morphisms of deformations with section and by def es s 0 the functor of isomorphism classes for details see gls 07 def 2 36 and the subsequent discussion since equimultiple deformations are defined for arbitrary s 0 this is also the case for es deformations in order to describe the semiuniversal es deformation of we have to introduce the equisingularity module of we have o c 0 r i 1 o ci 0 i r i 1 c ti with m r i 1 tic ti the jacobson radical of o c 0 writing elementes of o c 0 as column vector we define the equisingularity module ies of as the set of elements a 1 ar x b 1 br y m x m y such that xi ti ai ti yi ti bi ti is an es deformation of over t for t see appendix 7 it can be shown that i es is an oc 2 0 submodule of m x m y gls 07 prop ii 2 40 we identify now the submodule of ies defining trivial deformations of the algebra homomorphismus oc 2 0 c x y oc 0 r i 1 c ti 24 induced by maps x to x 1 t 1 xr tr and y to y 1 t 1 yr tr mapping the maximal ideal m x y of oc 2 0 to the oc 2 0 submodule m of oc 0 then m x m y is a oc 2 0 submodule of m x m y setting x i ti xi ti ti y i ti yi ti ti and x 1 t 1 x r tr x y 1 t 1 y r tr y we get the following o c 0 submodule of m x m y m c 1 x 1 cr x r x c 1 y 1 cry r y ci tic ti then xi ti ai ti yi ti bi

es is isomorphic as a c vector space to def es t the space of isomorphism classes of infinitesimal es deformations of gls 07 lemma ii 2 7 we are now in the position to formulate the main theorem about es deformations of the parametrization gls 07 theorem ii 238 theorem 4 2 greuel lossen shustin let c 0 r i 1 c 0 c 2 0 ti 7 xi ti yi ti be a parametrization of the reduced plane curve singularity c 0 with r branches if a j 1 a j r x b j 1 b j r y ies j 1 k 25 represent a basis resp a system of generators of t 1 es then c 0 r i 1 c ck 0 c 2 ck 0 ti s 7 xi ti s yi ti s s with xi ti s xi ti k j 1 a j

parametrization of a reduced plane curve singularity has a smooth base space of dimension dimc t 1 es remark 4 4 1 the base space of the semiuniversal es deformation of is not only smooth but a linear subspace of the vector space t 1 sec m x m y m m x m y which can be identified with the base space of the semiuniversal defor mation with sections of cf gls 07 prop ii 2 27 2 in the previous section we considered deformations of the normaliza tion n c 0 c 0 without section and used them to describe the constant stratum of c 0 theorem 3 1 let def n resp def secn be the deformations resp deformations with section of n and def resp def sec the deformations of we prove in gls 07 prop ii 2 23 that we can revover c 0 from the parametrization c 0 c 2 0 and that this holds for any deformation of in this way we get a surjection def n def inducing an isomorphism def n def of isomorphism classes between deformations of n and that of without section see also remark 3 3 the same holds for deformations with section in particular for infinitesimal deformations of n and of we have def n t def t t 1 o c 0 x o c 0 y o c 0 o c 0 x o c 0 y which are vector spaces of dimension c 0 c

was first devel oped in cgl 07 a even for algebroid plane curve singularities defined over an algebraically closed field of arbitrary characteristic it is essen tially the same as over the complex number an algorithm to compute t 1 es and hence the seminuniversal es deformations of is given in cgl 07 b algorithm 1 and remark 3 9 the nice thing with es deformations of the parametrization is that they are a linear subfunctor of arbitrary deformations of the parametrization and hence easy to describe we used them in gls 07 to derive properties of es deformation of the equation in particular to show that the constant stratum of a plane curve singularity is smooth as we are going to review now in section 1 of this article we considered 1 parameter i e over c 0 es deformations of the equation of a reduced plane curve singularity c 0 c 2 0 given by f oc 2 0 c x y now we define es deformations of c 0 over a not necessarily reduced complex germ s 0 of arbitrary di mension consider a deformation c 0 s 0 of c 0 with a section s 0 c 0 it is isomorphic to an embedded deformation of c 0 with trivial section by section 2 8 that is if s 0 is a subgerm of some ck 0 then there is an isomorphism c 0 f 1 0 0 c 2 s 0 0 for some holomorphic map f c 2 s 0 c 0 with f x y s f x y k i 1 sigi x y s s s 1 sk such that is the composition c 0 f 1 0 0 pr s 0 with pr the second projection and s 0 0 s under this isomorphism definition 4 5 the embedded deformation c 0 s 0 of c 0 with trivial section is equisingular along or an es deformation with section of c 0 if 27 i it is equimultiple along i e ord x y f mt c 0 ii after blowing up there exist sections through the infinitely near points in the first neighbourhood of c 0 such that the respective reduced total transform of c 0 is equisingular along these sections iii for a nodal curve c 0 defined by f x y xy an es deformation is an equimultiple deformation for an es deformation of c 0 with section the section is unique cf gls 07 prop ii 2 8 we call a deformation without section of c 0 equisin gular or an es deformation if there exists a section such that is equisingular along we denote the category of es deformations of c

semiuniversl defor mation of a reduced plane curve singularity is smooth of dimension t 1 es 28 for the proof see gls 07 theorem ii 2 64 and theorem ii 2 61 the proof is by induction on the number of blowing ups and uses the notion of equi intersectional deformations over arbitrary not necessarily reduced base spaces introduced in gls 07 remark 4 8 1 the first proof of the smoothness of the constant stratum for a reduced plane curve singularity was given by jonathan wahl in wa 74 using deformation theory of global objects namely of divisors supported on the exceptional divisor of the resolution of c 0 our proof first published in cgl 07 a and gls 07 using es deformations of the parametrization appears to be simpler than wahl s 2 an algorithm to compute the constant stratum is given in cgl 07 b algorithm 2 and remark 3 12 it is implemented in the singular library equising lib lm 07 5 a and invariant for isolated non normal sin gularities we introduce in this section a invariant and a invariant for isolated non normal singularities moreover we fix some notations to be used in the rest of this article most definitions and results of this section have been given in brg 90 for generically reduced curves the generalization to isolated non normal singularities given here is straightforward for a complex space x let xred denote its reduction and i xred x the closed embedding x and xred coincide as topological spaces but for the structure sheaves we have oxred ox nil ox where nil ox is the sheaf of nilpotent elements of ox if n x xred denotes the normalization of xred we call the composition x n xred i x the normalization of x x is normal if is an isomorphism a normal space is reduced and locally irreducible i e the germs x x are irreducible for all x x a germ is called locally irreducible if this holds for some representative 29 moreover we denote by w x xred the weak normalization of xred and by x w xred x the weak normalization of x x is weakly normal if is an isomorphism we call a morphism x x a partial normalization of x if factors as x xred x and if factors as x x x examples are the normalization the reduction and the weak normalization of x for a morphism f x t of complex spaces we denote by f red xred t red f f x t f f x t f f x t the induced morphisms and by xt f 1 t xredt f red 1 t x t f 1 t x t f 1 t x t f 1 t the corresponding fibres over t t recall that x is called weakly normal or maximal if every contin uous function on x which is holomorphic on the regular locus of x is holomorphic on x x is reduced and obtained from the normalization x by identifying points with the same image in x w is a homeomorphism cf fi 76 section 2 29 a germ x x is called normal resp weakly normal if this holds for some representative a curve singularity of embedding dimension r is weakly normal iff it consists of r smooth branches with independent tangent directions i e it is isomorphic to the coordinate axes in cr the whitney umbrella y 2 x 2 z 0 is an example of a weakly normal surface cf vi 11 it has a smooth normalization by an irreducible component of a complex space or a germ we always mean an irreducible component of its reduction x x is called irreducible if xred x is irreducible note that an irreducible germ need not be reduced if x x is a curve singularity i e a 1 dimensional germ an irreducible component of x x is also called a branch of x x 30 if a complex germ x x has r irreducible components xi x i 1 r its normalization is given by x x r i 1 x xi n xred x i x x with x x a multigerm x n 1 x and x i xi xi x the normaliza tion of xi x x x is normal iff x x x x is an isomorphism it is convenient to introduce r x x r x x 1 if r x x denotes the number of irreducible components of x x if x is a complex space and x x z an invariant defined for the germs x x such that x x 6 0 for only finitely many x x we write x x x x x definition 5 1 1 for a complex space x resp a germ x x we denote by xi resp by xi x the union the i dimensional irreducible components of xred resp of xred x we set x j i j xi x j x i j xi x and ri x irreducible componentes of xi ri x x irreducible components of xi x the latter is the same as the number of i dimensional minimal primes of ox x 2 we say that x is an isolated non normal point of x or x x is an isolated non normal singularity inns for short if there exists a neighbourhood u of x such that u r x is normal e g any isolated singularity is an inns let x n xred i x be the normalization of the complex space x and ox ox the induced map of the structure sheaves we have ker nil ox and coker ox oxred since is finite ker resp coker are 31 coherent sheaves of ox modules with support the non reduced locus resp the non normal locus of x if x x is an inns then ker x and coker x are finite dimen sional vector spaces and if dim x x 1 we have ker x nil ox x h 0 x ox where h 0 x denotes local cohomology if dim x x 0 we have dimch 0 x ox dimcnil ox x 1 for the definition of the isolated points of x play a special role let x 0 xred isolated points of xred be the positive dimensional part of xred and denote by x 0 x 0 the normalization with o x 0 ox 0 0 if dimx 0 definition 5 2 let x x be an inns we define x x dimch 0 x ox the epsilon invariant x x dimc ox 0 x ox 0 x x x the delta invariant and x x 2 x x r x x the invariant of x x remark 5 3 1 the above definition coincides with the classical inva riant resp milnor number x x if x x is a reduced curve singu larity it generalizes and defined in brg 90 for dim x x 1 we have x x x 0 x x x with x 0 x 0 and x 0 x 0 if and only if x 0 is normal at x or x 6 x 0 2 if dim x x 0 then x x dimcox x x x in particu lar x x 1 for x an isolated and reduced hence normal point of x 32 3 let dim x x 0 then x x xred x x x if x x is normal then x x x x x x 0 we have xred x xred x 0 and xred x 0 xred x 0 xred x is normal however we may have 0 and 0 if x x is not reduced and xred x is not normal e g x 0 k for the irreducible curve singularity x 0 defined by the ideal x 2 y 3 x 3 k y k 0 4 we observe that for any inns we have that x x is the euler characteristic o x x dimc h 0 o x x dimc h 1 o x x of the two term complex o x x 0 o 0 x x ox x o 1 x x ox 0 x 0 which turns out to be useful in proofs 5 if dim x x 2 we prefer the notion invariant instead of milnor number since its properties are then rather different from the classi cal milnor number for isolated hypersurface or complete intersection singularities for topological considerations the weak normalization turns out to be useful an example of a weakly normal germ x x is the 1 point union or bouquet of normal singularities in independent directions that is if xi 0 cni 0 i 1 r are normal germs then x 0 cn 1 cnr 0 is the union of the xi 0 embedded in the i th component 0 0 cni 0 0 any singularity isomorphic to x 0 is called an or dinary inns lemma 5 4 let x x be an inns with irreducible components xi x i 1 r and x x the weak normalization of x x the following holds for good representatives 1 xi xj x for i 6 j 2 the weak normalization x x is a homeomorphism 3 the irreducible components x i of x are normal and x i xi is the normalization of xi for i 1 r 4 x x is an ordinary inss proof 1 follows since x is an isolated non normal point in x and xi xj is non normal in any of its points while 2 is a general property of the 33 weak normalization cf fi 76 section 2 29 since x r x is normal the germ x x is constructed from the normalization x x r i 1 xi xi by identifying the xi xi in one point x this follows from the proof of the maximalization theorem in fi 76 section 2 29 see also the proof of the next lemma and proves 3 and 4 lemma 5 5 let x x be a reduced germ of dimension 1 then x x r x x and the following are equivalent i x x is a weakly normal inns ii x x is an ordinary inns iii x x r x x proof for x weakly normal and u x open we have ox u n ox u with ox u f u c continuous f u r sing x holomorphic n ox u f u r sing x c holomorphic and locally bounded on u to prove the equivalences of the lemma let x x be an inns since xr x is normal we have n ox ur x ox ur x and ur x r i 1 uir xi with xi the irreducible components of x and ui xi an open neighbourhood of xi hence for u sufficiently small n ox u f u r x c holomorphic and bounded in x therefore the jacobson radical j of n ox x represented by f n ox u with f xi 0 for all i is contained in ox x and we get since x x is reduced x x dimc n ox x ox x r 1 the constants of ox x are diagonally embedded in n ox x the argument shows also that x x is an ordinary inns and that x x r 1 with equalitiy iff j is contained in ox x i e iff x x is an ordinary inns this proves the lemma the following definition is quite useful in our context it should however not be confused with the intersection multiplicity defined by serre in se 65 34 for two complex germs x 0 x 0 cn 0 defined by ideals i i ocn 0 we define the intersection number as x x 0 dimcocn 0 i i which is finite iff x 0 x 0 0 proposition 5 6 let xi 0 cn 0 i 1 p be isolated non normal singularities defined by ideals ii ocn 0 such that for i 6 j xi 0 xj 0 0 we set x 0 p i 1 xi 0

maximal ideal m since xred x is defined by i r i 1 pi we get the primary decomposition of i as in the following corollary corollary 5 7 let x 0 cn 0 be an inns dim x 0 0 defined by the ideal i ocn 0

nor malizations and equinormalizability and prove some consequences for maps that admit a simultaneous normalization moreover we recall the main re sults from chiang hsieh and lipman in cl 06 and kolla r in ko 11 about simultaneous normalization of projective morphisms let f x s be a morphism of complex spaces we call f regular resp normal resp weakly normal resp reduced at x x if f is flat at x and if the fibre xf x is regular resp normal resp weakly normal resp reduced at x the morphism f is called regular resp normal resp weakly normal resp reduced if this holds at every x x recall that a complex space x is said to be weakly normal or maximal if every continuous function on x which is holomorphic on the regular locus of x is holomorphic on x the following sets flat f x x f is flat in x reg f x x f is regular in x nor f x x f is normal in x wor f x x f is weakly normal in x red f x x f is reduced in x are analytically open subsets of x for flat cf fr 67 th or me iv 9 and for reg nor wor red see bf 93 theorem 1 1 2 theorem 2 1 2 nflat f sing f nnor f nwor f nred f denote the corresponding ana lytic sets of non flat non regular or singular non normal non weakly nor mal non reduced points of f we denote by nor x resp wor x resp red x the set of normal resp weakly normal resp reduced points of x and with an n in front the corresponding complements the set of regular points of x is denoted by reg x and its complement by sing x let us recall the following well known result proposition 6 1 let f x s be a morphism of complex spaces 1 if f is reduced then x is reduced if and only if f x red s 2 i if f is regular then x is regular if and only if f x reg s ii if x is reduced and f flat then reg f is dense in x 39 3 if f is normal then x is normal resp weakly normal if and only if f x nor s resp f x wor s for the proof of 1 and 3 we refer to mat 86 corollary to theorem 23 9 ni 81 2 4 and man 80 iii 3 for 2 see gls 07 definition ii 1 112 and theorem ii 1 115 for i and corollary ii 1 116 for ii we need also the following theorem theorem 6 2 let f x s be a morphism of complex spaces 1 if s is generically 2 reduced then f nflat f is neglectible 3 in s 2 assume there is an open dense subset v s with v reg s i if f 1 v reg x then f sing f is neglectible in s ii if f 1 v nor x then f nnor f is neglectible in s iii if f 1 v wor x then f nwor f is neglectible in s iv if f 1 v red x then f nred f is neglectible in s if the restriction of f to sing f resp nnor f resp nwor f resp nred f is proper then in statements i to iv neglectible can be re placed by a nowhere dense closed analytic subset statement 1 is due to frisch fr 67 prop iv 14 statement 2 i is sard s theorem while the rest is proved in bf 93 theorem 2 1 3 following cl 06 and ko 11 we make the following definition 6 3 let f x s be a morphism of complex spaces 1 a simultaneous normalization of f is a morphism n x x such that i n is finite ii f f n x s is normal 2 we say that a property p holds generically on x if the set of points where p holds contains an analytically open dense subset of x i e the complement is analytic and nowhere dense in x 3 a subset n of a complex space x is called neglectible if n is contained in a countable union of nowhere dense locally analytic subsets of x then x n is dense in x by baire s theorem 40 iii the induced map ns x s f 1 s xs is bimeromorphic for each s f x 2 f is called equinormalizable if the normalization x x is a simultaneous normalization of f f is called equinormalizable at x x if the restriction of f to some neighborhood of x is equinormalizable 3 we say that n x x is a simultaneous weak normalization of f if it satisfies i and iii of 1 and if f x s is weakly normal if f x x s s is a morphism of germs then a simultaneous normal ization of f is a morphism n from a multi germ x n 1 x to x x such that some representative of n is a simultaneous normalization of a represen tative of f the germ f is called equinormalizable if some representative of f is equinormalizable remark 6 4 1 ns x s xs is finite hence proper a proper bimero morphic morphism is surjective since the image is closed and contains an open dense subset it follows that x s and xs are generically iso morphic 2 simultaneous normalizations need not be unique cf ko 11 example 1 8 they are unique if s is normal since then n is the normalization of x by proposition 6 6 5 lemma 6 5 if f x s admits a simultaneous normalization then f red xred sred admits also a simultaneous normalization the converse holds if the non empty fibres xs of f are generically reduced proof let n x x be a simultaneous normalization of f and let f red x sred be the map obtained from f x s by base change sred s then f red is flat with normal hence reduced fibres and therefore x is reduced by proposition 6 1 1 since x and x are topologically the same spaces it follows that x is the reduction x red of x then n induces a map nred x red xred which is easily seen to be a simultaneous normalization of f red for the converse we note that xreds xs is bimeromorphic if xs is generically reduced although we do not require f to be flat in definition 6 3 the follow ing proposition shows that f has to be generically flat in order to admit a simultaneous normalization and at non flat points f must be almost flat 41 proposition 6 6 assume that f x s admits a simultaneous normal ization n x x 1 ns x s xs is the normalization of xs and xs is generically normal hence generically reduced for each s f x 2 f is open and for each x x the dimension formula holds dim x x dim xf x x dim s f x 3 if xf x is reduced at x then f is flat at x in particular f is generically flat on x and x x is reduced if xf x x and s f x are reduced 4 n nnor f is nowhere dense in x and n 1 n is nowhere dense in x n x x is surjective and n x n 1 n x n is an isomorphism moreover nnor f xs nnor xs for s f x 5 x is normal if and only if n is the normalization of x and this is equivalent to f x nor s in particular if s is normal then n is the normalization of x and if f x nor s then f is not equinor malizable 6 if s s is any morphism then the pullback xs s of f admits a simultaneous normalization in particular if s s is the normaliza tion of s then x s s is equinormalizable 7 x is weakly normal resp reduced if and only if f x wor s resp f x red s 8 x and x are generically reduced if s is generically reduced proof 1 since x s is normal ns factors through xs red hence ns x s xs red is finite and bimeromorphic and therefore the normalization map cf gr 84 ch 8 3 3 and 4 2 moreover since x s and xs are generically isomorphic by remark 6 4 xs is generically normal 2 since f is flat it is open and therefore f is open to see the dimension formula note that dim x x dim x s x dim s s for x n 1 x and s f x f x since f is flat as x s is the normalization of xs we can choose x n 1 x such that dim x s x dim xs x then dim x x dim x x dim xs x dim s s 42 since the other inequality is always true the dimension formula follows 3 if xs x is reduced for s f x then oxs x ns ox s x is injective by gls 07 prop b 5 3 it follows that n ox ox x is os s flat and since n ox x is os s flat we have that ox x is os s flat by gls 07 cor b 5 2 since the non empty fibres are generically reduced by 1 f is generically flat for the rest use proposition 6 1 1 4 n x x is surjective since ns x s xs is surjective for s f x by 1 for y n 1 nor xs n x y x n y induces an isomor phism of the fibres by 1 since f is flat n is itself an isomorphism at y cf gls 07 lemma i 1 86 hence f is normal at n y and we conclude nnor f xs nnor xs since the other inclusion is always true we get n xs nnor xs moreover n is bijective over x n and hence n x n 1 n x n is an isomorphism since x s xs is bimeromor phic nor xs is open and dense in xs and hence n xs nnor xs has everywhere smaller dimension than xs hence for x n we get dim n x dim n xs x dim s s dim xs x dim s s dim x x therefore n is nowhere dense in x by ritt s lemma and since n is finite a dimension argument shows that n 1 n is nowhere dense in x 5 since f f n is normal we get that x is normal if and only if f x f x nor s by proposition 6 1 if x is normal n is the normalization by 4 if f x nor s then x is not normal and hence the normalization x x cannot be a simultaneous normalization of f 6 the preservation of simultaneous normalization by base change follows from that of flatness the rest is a consequence of 5 7 this is an immediate consequence of proposition 6 1 applied to f 8 since f is reduced the restriction induces a map nred x nred s by proposition 6 1 this implies for s f x dim nred x x dim nred s s dim x s x dim x x since dim nred s s dim s s and since f is flat hence nred x is nowhere dense in x since x and x are generically isomorphic by 4 we get also that nred x is nowhere dense in x remark 6 7 1 statement 5 was proved in cl 06 theorem 2 3 for f a reduced map 43 2 simultaneous normalizations are only interesting for morphisms with positive fibre dimension namely if a finite morphism f x s admits a simultaneous normalization then f x x s f x is an isomorphism for each x x in fact since f is finite x is an isolated point of xs s f x since ns x s xs is bimeromorphic x s n 1 x xs x and hence x is a smooth point of xs therefore f is flat at x proposition 6 6 3 with smooth 0 dimensional fibre and hence an isomorphism at x note that x x does not need to be pure dimensional if f x x s s admits a simultaneous normalization even if s s is normal cf the orem 7 17 by the following lemma it is however not allowed that the nearby fibres of f have isolated points if the special fibre has positive di mension moreover there is an intimate relation between the irreducible components of the total space and of the fibres of f lemma 6 8 let f x x s s have a simultaneous normalization and assume that s s is locally irreducible e g if s s is normal 1 the germs x x and xs x have the same number of irreducible components 2 for each irreducible component x s x of xs x there exists a unique irreducible component x x of x x containing x s x the corre sponding components satisfy dim x x dim x s x dim s s in particular if dim xs x 0 then each irreducible component of x x has dimension dim s s proof let s s be the normalization of s and x s s the pullback of f since s s is irreducible for each s in a neighbourhood of s s s is homeomorphic to s s for a unique s s hence x x is homeomorphic to x s x for the unique preimage x of x and we get a bijection between the irreducible components of x x and x s x and between those of xs x and x s s x by proposition 6 6 6 we may therefore assume that s s is normal now let n x x be a simultaneous normalization of f then ns x s n 1 x xs x is the normalization of the fibre xs x of f and n x n 1 x x x the normalization of the total space proposition 6 6 1 follows since in both cases the irreducible components are in 1 1 44 correspondance to the points of n 1 x moreover for each x n 1 x x s x resp x x is the normalization of the corresponding component x s x resp x x proving the first part of 2 for the unique x x belonging to x x we get dim x x dim x x dim x s x dim s s dim x s x dim s s finally if dim xs x 0 then xs x is not a point and all irreducible components of xs x have dimension 0 and the last statement follows let f x s be a morphism of complex spaces such that the fibres xs s s have only finitely many non normal points we call f locally delta constant if the function s 7 xs is locally constant on s a morphism of germs is constant if it has a constant representative in cl 06 chiang hsieh and lipman reconsider teissier s constant cri terion and in addition consider projective morphisms f x s with fibres of arbitrary dimension replacing the invariant by the hilbert polynomial they prove theorem 6 9 chiang hsieh lipman let f x s pr s be a flat projective morphism of complex spaces with s irreducible and normal x locally equidimensional and all fibres xs reduced for s s let s xs xs be the normalization of xs and with oxs s oxs let h oxs n oxs opr n be the hilbert polynomial of the coherent sheaf oxs on xs pr then f is equinormalizable iff the hilbert polynomial h oxs is constant on s remark 6 10 1 locally equidimensional means that for each x x the irreducible components of the germ x x have the same dimen sion since f is flat and s locally irreducible this implies that xs is locally equidimensional moreover it follows that x is reduced 2 theorem 6 9 is in cl 06 deduced from an analogous theorem for al gebraic schemes over a perfect field 3 since f is flat the hilbert polynomial h oxs is constant on s it follows from the exact sequence 0 oxs oxs oxs oxs 0 45 that h oxs is constant iff h oxs oxs is constant if the fibres are reduced curves then h oxs oxs xs and the theorem follows from theorem 4 4 since the projective curves xs have only finitely many singularities the assumptions in theorem 6 9 can be weakened as has been shown by kolla r in ko 11 theorem 6 11 kollar let f x s be a projective morphism of algebraic schemes over a perfect field with s semi normal such that all fibres xs are locally equidimensional of the same dimension and generically reduced then f admits a simultane ous normalization iff the hilbert polynomial h oxs is constant on s for the notion of semi normal we refer to the reference given in ko 11 we have normal weakly normal semi normal reduced in character istic 0 weakly normal coincides with semi normal a survey on weak and semi normality can be found in vi 11 remark 6 12 1 in theorem 6 11 it is not assumed that f is flat but it follows from the assumptions that f is generically flat on x and that x is generically reduced and equidimensional if s is connected by propositon 6 6 3 2 passing from reduced fibres to generically reduced fibres is a non trivial generalization at least from the point of view in cl 06 where the authors make essential use of reducedness of the fibres it follows from proposition 6 6 1 that generically reduced is a necessary condition for simultaneous normalization the approach of kolla r is different from that of chiang hsieh and lip man for a morphism f x s of algebraic schemes over a field kolla r considers the functor of simultaneous normalizations of f simnor f which associates to a morphism t s the set of simultaneous normaliza tions of the pull back xt t kolla r proves in ko 11 theorem 1 theorem 6 13 kollar let f x s be a proper morphism such that all fibres xs are generically geometrically reduced then there exists a morphism of schemes sn s which represent the functor simnor f in particular for any morphism t s xt t has a simultaneous normalization iff factors through sn s 46 the construction of sn and hence of a fine moduli space for simultaneous normalizations is a new idea of kolla r it works only for proper and hence for projective morphisms a similar construction in the local or affine setting is not known 7 families of isolated non normal singularities in this section we present our results about 1 parametric families f x t t a 1 dimensional complex manifold of isolated non normal singularities of arbitrary dimension we use the notations of section 5 in particular x x is the normalization x x the weak normalization and we have f red f xred f f f f f 1 f x 1 with fibres xredt f red 1 t xt f 1 t x t f 1 t x 1 t f 1 1 t note that xredt xt and x t need not be reduced normal and weakly normal respectively the corresponding reduction normalization and weak normalization are denoted correspondingly by xt red xt and x t x 1 t denotes the fibre of f 1 f 1 1 x 1 t we use similar notations for germs for topological considerations the flatness assumption is often too strong for 1 parametric families we may consider the weaker notion of activeness which we introduce now definition 7 1 let f x t be morphism of complex spaces with t a 1 dimension complex manifold we call f active at x if f red xred t is flat at x and f is called active if it is active at every x x remark 7 2 1 the notion of acticity was introduced by grauert and remmert in gr 84 2 1 who call an element f ox x active if the image f red oxred x is a non zero divisor n z d of oxred x since the morphism of germs f red xred x c 0 is flat iff f red is a non zero divisor of oxred x both notions coincide for f mx x the maximal ideal of ox x 2 the active set of f act f x x f is active at x 47 coincides with flat f red and hence is analytically open in x by the theorem of frisch a simple argument is given in gr 84 since xred is reduced and f red is flat it follows from gls 07 cor ii 1 116 that reg f red is dense in x for f active 3 since the set of zerodivisors of ox x resp oxred x is the union of all associated resp minimal prime ideals of ox x f is flat resp active iff f is not contained in any associated resp minimal prime ideal of ox x in particular we get for a morphism f x x c 0 f is active dimoxi x f dimoxi x 1 for each irreducible component xi x of x x 4 activeness is a purely topological condition we have for f x t f is active f is open the openness follows since flat maps are open by fi 76 3 10 lemma 1 and since f and f red are topologically the same maps conversely let f be open and x x if x x is irreducible then f x 6 0 and we are done otherwise let x x be an irreducible component of x x and x x the union of the remaining irreducible components of x x then there exist y x rx arbitrary close to x and we can choose an open neigbourhood u in x with u x since f u is open by assumption f x is not constant this shows that f is not contained in any minimal prime of ox x and hence f is active the next lemma and lemma 9 5 show that activeness is a natural as sumption lemma 7 3 let f x x c 0 be a morphism of complex germs 1 if f is flat then f is active 2 f is active if and only if f x x c 0 is flat proof 1 follows from remark 7 2 3 2 if f is flat at x then f is a n z d of o x 1 x since oxred x is a subring of ox x f red is a n z d of oxred x i e f is active at x for the converse consider the conductor c anno xred n ox oxred 48 which is coherent because the sheaf n ox oxred is coherent denote by nnor xred the non normal locus of xred which is nowhere dense in xred then nnor xred is the vanishing locus of c it follows from the prime avoidance theorem that there exists an element h cx such that h is not contained in any associated prime of oxred x thus h is a n z d of oxred x and h n ox x oxred x therefore we have n ox x h 1 oxred x since f is active f red is a n z d of oxred x h 1 oxred x hence of n ox x this implies that f is a n z d of o x 1 x more generally we have the following result lemma 7 4 1 if f is flat and x x is a subgerm of x x defined by the intersection of some primary or prime ideals of ox x then f x x is also flat 2 if f is active and x x x x a partial normalization of x x then f f x c is flat at every point of x 1 x proof 1 follows again from remark 7 2 3 2 since f is a n z d of ox x by lemma 7 3 f is a n z d of ox x ox x since factors through the reduction of x note that the statement of lemma 7 3 1 is false for a morphism f x x s s with s s not smooth or of dimension bigger than one see fi 76 3 13 example for an example with s s reduced of dimension 1 and cn 76 with f x x c 2 0 f flat but f red not flat the following lemma shows that activeness is a necessary condition for equinormalizability while flatness is not we may add an extra fat point to x x of arbitrary length destroying flatness but neither activeness nor simultaneous normalization cf lemma 6 5 lemma 7 5 if f x x c 0 admits a simultaneous normalization then f is active proof this follows from lemma 7 3 2 lemma 7 6 let f x x c 0 be active and x 0 x reduced then x x is reduced and f is flat moreover x x is either 1 dimensional and smooth or depth x x 2 and dim xi x 2 for each irreducible component xi x of x x 49 proof consider the diagram 0 nil ox f ox f oxred fred 0 0 nil ox ox oxred 0 since f is active f red is injective and since ox 0 is reduced the sanke lemma implies that nil ox fnil ox 0 by nakayama s lemma nil ox 0 x is reduced and f is flat if dim x x 1 then x 0 x is a reduced point and f is locally an isomorphism if dim x x 2 then depth x 0 x 1 since it is reduced of positive dimension hence depth x x 2 proposition 7 7 let f x x c 0 be active x 1 x x x the normalization and x x x x the weak normalization for good representatives f x t f x t and f x t the following holds 1 let x 0 r x be reduced i f is flat on x r x f is flat on x and f is flat on x ii nred f is finite over t and hence all fibres xt t t are reduced outside finitely many points iii x is generically reduced and reduced at y x 0 r x we have x r x reduced f reduced on x r x xt reduced for t t r 0 iv if f is flat then x is reduced iff xt is reduced for t t r 0 2 let x 0 r x be normal i nnor f is finite over t and all fibres xt t t are normal outside finitely many points ii f is normal outside 1 x and xt xt is the normalization for t t r 0 iii x is generically normal and we have xr x normal f normal on x r x xt normal for t t r 0 iv xt is reduced for t t r 0 3 let x 0 r x be weakly normal 50 i nwor f is finite over t and all fibres xt t t are weakly normal outside finitely many points ii f is weakly normal outside x 1 x and x t xt is the weak normalization for t t r 0 iii x is generically weakly normal and we have x r x weakly nor mal f weakly normal on x r x xt weakly normal for t t r 0 iv x t is reduced for t t r 0 proof it follows from lemma 7 6 that in any of the three cases f is flat at points of x 0 r x 1 i since f is flat at points y x 0 r x the analytic set nflat f is finite over t then f nflat f is a closed analytic set in t which is nowhere dense by theorem 6 2 1 and therefore equal to 0 it follows that f is flat on x r x the flatness of f and f follows now from lemma 7 3 and lemma 7 4 ii since f is flat on x r x by i we have nred f x 0 r x nred x 0 r x and hence nred f is finite over t iii x is generically reduced by ii and proposition 6 1 1 and x is reduced at y x 0 r x if x r x is reduced then we can apply theorem 6 2 2 iv to get that f nred f 0 and that f is reduced on xr x hence xt t t r 0 is reduced if xt t t r 0 is reduced then f is x is reduced at y xt by 1 and hence x r x reduced since it is reduced at y x 0 r x iv let f be flat and xt reduced for t 6 0 then x r x is reduced by iii hence nil ox x has support x and is therefore killed by some power of f since f is flat every power of f is a n z d of ox x implying nil ox x 0 2 i follows as in 1 ii ii nnor f is finite over t since f is flat by 1 i it follows from theorem 6 2 2 ii applied to f that f nnor f 0 and hence that f is normal outside 1 x it follows that xt is normal for t 6 0 and that x t xt is the normalization 51 iii applying theorem 6 2 2 ii to nnor f this follows as in 1 iii iv since f is flat and x reduced this follows from 1 iv 3 the proof is the same as for 2 using theorem 6 2 2 iii remark 7 8 1 if f x x c 0 is active and f x t a good representative then we get for the number of 1 dimensional com ponents of x x r 1 x x r 0 xt isolated points of xt for t t r 0 2 if r 1 x x 6 0 let x 1 be the union of the 1 dimensional irreducible components of x since x 1 is reduced the fibre x 1 t of f 1 f x 1 is re duced for t 6 0 proposition 7 7 1 with x 1 t isolated points of xt note that x and xt need not be reduced at points y x 1 t f 1 is flat and hence by gls 07 theorem 1 81 2 x 10 dimc ox 1 x f isolated points of xt t 6 0 proposition 7 9 let f x x c 0 be active with x 0 x an inns i if r 1 x x 0 then x 0 x f 1 0 x is reduced ii if r 1 x x 6 0 let x x be an irreducible component of x 1 x with x 1 x the corresponding point in x then then x 0 x is reduced iff x x is smooth and x 0 1 iii the fibres x t of f and xt of f have the same normalization for all t t if dim x x 2 then x 0 x and x 0 x have the same normalization iff r 1 x x 0 iv let f be flat then depth x x 2 iff r 1 x x 0 and x 0 x is reduced if dim x x 2 then x 0 x reduced implies r 1 x x 0 and hence x 0 x reduced is equivalent to depth x x 2 proof i follows from iv applied to f ii if x 0 x is a reduced point then f x x c 0 is an isomor phism and hence f x x c 0 is an isomorphism 52 iii since x t xt is bimeromorphic the normalization of x t is also the normalization of xt if dim x x 2 then dim x 0 x 1 and hence its normalization x 0 satisfies dim x 0 x 1 for each x x since r 1 x x is the number of isolated points of the fibre x 0 r 1 x x 0 iv if depth x x 2 all components of x x have dimension 2 and depth x 0 x 1 implying x 0 x reduced since it is an inns con versely let dim x x 2 and x 0 x reduced then dim x 0 x 1 and depth x 0 x 1 which implies depth x x 2 and therefore r 1 x x 0 proving the claim for a deeper investigation of the behavior of and other invariants in active families f x t we need to consider partial normalizations of f and the restriction of f to subspaces of x in order to treat these situations simultaneously we introduce the notion of moderation as isolated points play a special role for the definition of so does the 1 dimensional part of x when we study 1 parametric constant families of isolated non normal singularities this 1 dimensional part can be changed by a moderation which we define now definition 7 10 let f x t be active with t a pure 1 dimensional complex manifold and with nnor f finite over t a morphism x x is called a moderation of f if i is finite ii there exists a closed analytic subset n x finite over t such that with n 1 n x r n x rn is an isomorphism iii f f x t is active examples of a moderation are the reduction xred x the inclusion x 1 x the normalization x x and the weak normalization x x lemma 7 11 let x x be a moderation of f x t 1 if ox ox is the induced map of structure sheaves then ker and coker are finite over t 2 nnor f is finite over t 3 x 1 x 1 is bimeromorphic 53 4 for t t the fibre x 1 t of f x 1 has the same normalization as the fibre x 1 t of f x 1 proof 1 ker and coker are contained in n hence finite over t 2 nnor f is finite over t since it is contained in n 3 since dim n dimn 1 n and n are nowhere dense in x 1 and x 1 respectively 4 since n and n are finite over t n x 1 t and n x 1 t consist of finitely many points and t x 1 t x 1 t is bimeromorphic if t x 1 t x 1 t is the normalization of x 1 t then t t is the normalization of x 1 t the following lemma is used when we study the fibres of a moderation lemma 7 12 let z z z z z 1 z be finite such that for small representatives z r z is normal and z r z z r z is an isomorphism let oz z oz z and 0 oz 0 z oz 0 z be the maps induced by and 0 z 0 z 0 then z 0 z and z 0 z z 0 1 z have the same normaliza tion and has a finite dimensional kernel and cokernel satisfying dimc coker dimc ker z z z z z z z z dimc coker 0 proof since z r z z r z is an isomorphism as well as 0 have finite dimensional kernel and cokernel if dim z z 0 then z consists of finitely many isolated points of z and we have dimcoz z z z z z and dimc oz z z z z z the claim follows with coker 0 0 let dim z z 1 then zred z z 0 z and z red z z 0 z finitely many isolated points of z let n z 0 z z 0 z be the normalization map since z 0 r z is dense in z 0 and 0 z 0 r z z 0 r z is an isomorphism n z 0 z z 0 z is the normal ization 54 now consider the 2 term complexes o 0 oz z oz 0 z 0 o 0 oz z n oz 0 z 0 and and the morphism o o with 0 and the identity in degree 1 let k resp c be the 1 term complexes ker resp coker concentrated in degree 0 then we have the exact sequence of complexes 0 k o o c 0 taking euler characteristics we get dimc coker dimc ker o o z z showing the first equality since z z 0 z we get z z z z z 0 z 0 from the inclusions oz 0 z oz 0 z oz 0 z the second equality follows proposition 7 13 let f x x c 0 be flat with x 0 x an inns and let x x x x be a moderation of f such that f f is flat then we have for good representatives f x t and f x t with fibres xt f 1 t and x t f 1 t t t i x 0 xt x 0 x t ii x 0 xt x

hence we get dimc coker 0 dimc ker 0 x 0 x 0 for 0 ox 0 x ox 0 x the map induced by ox x ox x 55 now consider the commutative diagram for fixed t t 0 ox f t ox oxt t 0 ox f t ox ox t 0 with exact rows since f and f are flat and is an exact functor is finite we set n ker ox ox m coker ox ox since n and m are finite over t f n and f m are ot coherent since ot 0 is a principal ideal domain we have for

isolated non normal singularity for a good representative f x t the following holds 1 if t 6 0 then x 0 xt is equal to i xred 0 xredt xred 0 xt red ii x 0 x t x 0 r 1 x x iii x 10 x 1 t x 1 0 0 iv x 0

red xred t to f 1 x 1 t and to f x t which are flat by lemma 7 4 i follows then from proposition 7 7 1 ii saying that xredt is reduced while ii follows from proposition 7 7 2 ii noting that x t is normal hence x t isolated points of x t isolated points of xt r 1 x x applying proposition 7 13 to f and f 1 gives the first equality and ap plying it again to f 1 and f 1 we deduce iii from ii to prove iv we apply proposition 7 13 to f and get x 0 xt x 0 x t for t t 57 since x t is weakly normal by proposition 7 7 3 we get from lemma 5 5 for t 6 0 x t x t 0 x t r x t 0 isolated points of x t r xt r 1 x x to determine x 0 consider the weak normalization w x 0 x 0 and the normalization x 0 x 0 of x 0 which factors as x 0 x 0 w x 0 we have x 0 x 0 red x 0 and from the morphisms o x 0 w w o x 0 o x 0 we get x 0 red x 0 dimcw o x 0 o x 0 red r x 0 dimc coker w by lemma 5 5 2 from proposition 7 13 we get x 0 xt x 10 x 1 t since coker t 0 for t t in this case since x 1 is reduced x 1 t is reduced by proposition 7 7 1 iv as it has no 0 dimensional part we get x 1 t 0 as an immediate consequence of theorem 7 14 we get corollary 7 15 1 the functions t 7 xt and t 7 xt are upper semicontinuous on t 2 if r 1 x x 0 then x 0 x is reduced and x 0 xt x 0 0 with x 0 0 iff x 0 is normal from theorem 7 14 we deduce also easily constant criteria for the si multaneous normalization of 1 parametric families of isolated non normal singularities theorem 7 16 let f x x c 0 be flat with x 0 x an isolated non normal singularity and dim x 0 x 1 then the following are equiva lent 1 f is constant 58 2 f red is constant 3 f 1 is constant 4 f 1 is equinormalizable proof 1 2 resp 1 3 follows immediately from theorem 7 14 moreover f is constant if and only if x 1 0 0 and this is equiv alent to x 1 0 normal since x 1 0 is reduced by proposition 7 9 1 hence 4 1 conversely if f is constant then x 10 is normal it follows that f 1 is normal since it is flat and x 1 t x 1 t is the normalization by proposition 7 7 2 which implies that f 1 is equinormalizable theorem 7 17 let f x x c 0 be flat with x 0 x an inns of dimension 1 then f is equinormalizable if and only if f is constant and r 1 x x 0 proof the necessity of r 1 x x 0 for equinormalizability follows from lemma 6 8 2 if r 1 x x 0 then f red f 1 and the fibres of f are gener ically reduced by proposition 7 7 1 the result follows from corollary 7 16 and the fact that f is equinormalizable if and only if f red is equinormalizable by lemma 6 5 corollary 7 18 let f x x c 0 be active with x 0 x a reduced inns of dimension 1 then f is equinormalizable iff it is constant proof by lemma 7 6 x x is reduced and f is flat then r 1 x x 0 by proposition 7 9 iv and the result follows from theorem 7 17 note that dim x 0 x 0 implies that f x x c 0 is equinormal izable if and only if f is an isomorphism cf remark 6 7 2 theorem 7 19 let f x t be a flat morphism of complex spaces with t a 1 dimensional complex manifold such that the non normal locus of f is finite over t then the following are equivalent i f is equinormalizable ii xt is constant on t and the 1 dimensional part x 1 of x is smooth and does not meet the higher dimensional part x 1 59 proof let x x be the normalization and f f then f is equinormalizable iff f is normal which is a local condition on x and if xt xt is bimeromorphic for t f x we have by proposition 6 1 that nnor x nnor f and that nnor xt nnor f xt hence x r 1 nnor f x r nnor f and x t r 1 nnor xt x t r nnor xt are isomorphisms it follows that xt xt is bimeromorphic iff dim nnorxt x dim xt x for all x xt which is a local condition on x hence we have to show the equivalence of i ad ii only for the germs f x x t f x for each x x if x x 1 then dim xf x x 1 and we get from theorem 7 17 that f x x t f x is equinormalizable iff f is constant and x 6 x 1 x 1 in particular x 1 x if x x 1 then x 1 x x x dim xf x x 0 and f x x t f x is equinormalizable iff f is an isomorphism this implies that x is smooth at x and xt 1 for t in a neighbourhood of f x conversely if x 1 x x x is smooth then x x x 1 x and f f is normal at x hence f is regular on u r x for a neighbourhood u of x in x since f is flat dimcoxf y y 1 and hence xf y y 1 for y u remark 7 20 1 theorem 7 19 shows that the equidimensionality assump tion by chiang hsieh and lipman in theorem 6 9 and by kolla r in theorem 6 11 is not necessary at least for 1 parametric families of inns the only geometric necessary condition for equinormalizability is that of 7 19 ii 2 theorem 7 19 applies of course to proper analytic and hence algebraic morphisms f with nnor f finite over t kolla r s result in theorem 6 11 does however not imply theorem 7 19 since in our case f x t need not be algebraic the paper bf 79 contains examples of flat analytic morphisms f x x c 0 with all fibres homogeneous singularities of dimension n for any n 0 such that ox x is not the analytic ring of some algebraic c scheme if n 1 resp 2 then x x can even be chosen reduced resp normal 60 8 connected components of the milnor fibre the main purpose of this section is to study topological properties of the general fibre of a flat morphism f x x c 0 with special fibre x 0 x an inns of arbitrary dimension we determine the number of connected components of the milnor fibre xt f 1 t t t r 0 for a good repre sentative f x t some of these properties have already been proved in brg 90 for generically reduced curves we continue to use the notations of section 5 and in particular consider the induced morphisms f red f f and the invariants xt xt r xt and xt in addition we denote for any topological space y by bi y dimch i y c the i th betti number and by y i 0 1 ibi y the topological euler characteristic b 0 y is the number of connected components of y and bi y 0 for i n if y is a stein complex space of dimension n in our situation for a good representative x is a stein space and the fibres are also stein spaces before we consider families of inns we start with an arbitrary morphism f x x c 0 and prove a connectedness result for the milnor fibre theorem 8 2 and corollary 8 4 which seems to be new for dim x x 2 this was proved in bug 80 by proving coherence and local freeness of a certain hypercohomology group the method can easily be generalized to higher dimensions if the singular set of f is finite over t and with more effort also to our more general situation in a personal cor respondence helmut a hamm ha 16 and j fern ndez de bobadilla bo 16 proposed easier topological proofs for x x irreducible hamm s proof goes by induction on the dimension and uses a weak lefschetz theorem he obtains also some information about fundamental groups while bobadilla proposed to use the monodromy the final general result as presented in proposition 8 2 is based on bobadilla s idea and resulted from discussions of the author with hamm we need also a general fibration theorem due to l du ng tra ng le 77 see also le 76 for a detailed account saying that for an arbitrary morphism 61 of complex germs f x x c 0 and for a good representative f x t f x x x 0 t 0 t is a topological fibre bundle the geometric monodromy of this fibre bundle permutes the irreducible components of the milnor fibre f xt t t lemma 8 1 let f x t be a good representative of f x x c 0 1 if f is flat then sing f sing x 0 sing x sing xt xt sing f t t 2 if the monodromy of the fibre bundle f x t acts trivially on the irreducible components of f then there is a bijection between the irreducible components of f and those of x that are not contained in x 0 proof 1 since f is flat sing xt xt sing f for t t by gls 07 theorem i 1 115 c x z is smooth if f is smooth at z by proposition 6 1 hence sing x 0 sing x sing f we claim that xt sing x is smooth for t 6 0 otherwise sing f would contain a germ of a curve c 0 x 0 finite over t and not contained in sing x at z c r 0 x is smooth and f has a singularity hence for t close to f z the fibre xt is smooth at z close to z cf gls 07 lemma i 2 4 contradicting that c is a curve which is finite over t this proves 1 2 since the statement is purely set theoretically we may assume that x is reduced if f x 0 the statement is trivially true and if x contains irreducible components that are mapped to 0 by f we omit them as they do not affect the milnor fibre we may therefore assume that f is active and hence flat since x is reduced for any reduced complex space x the irre ducible components are the topological closure of the connected components of x sing x moreover x is irreducible iff x a is connected for any subspace a of codimension 1 it follows that the irreducible components of x that are not contained in x 0 correspond to the connected components of x sing x and from 1 we get that the irreducible components of f correspond to the connected components of f sing x the monodromy acts on x sing x and in duces an action h on the integer homology it gives rise to an exact sequence the wang sequence of the fibre bundle x t see mi 68 lemma 8 4 62 h 0 f sing x h id h 0 f sing x h 0 x sing x 0 since h acts trivially on h 0 f sing x the second arrow is an isomor phism which proves the claim theorem 8 2 bobadilla greuel hamm 2017 let f x x c 0 be a morphism of complex germs and f x t a good representative 1 let x x be irreducible and red x 0 6 i e there exist points y x 0 arbitrary close to x such that x 0 y is reduced then the milnor fibre of f is irreducible 2 let x x be reducible with irreducible components xi x i 1 r and assume that the intersection graph g f is connected then the milnor fibre of f is connected here g f is the graph with vertices i 1 r and we join i 6 j by an edge iff red x 0 xi xj 6 i e there exist points y x 0 xi xj arbitrary close to x such that x 0 y is reduced proof let f red denote the restriction of f to the reduction xred of x since f red 1 0 is reduced at y if x 0 is reduced at y and since the statements about the milnor fibre concern only the reduced structure we may assume that x is reduced 1 if f x 0 the statement is trivially true hence we may assume that f is flat the monodromy of the fibre bundle x t permutes the irreducible components of the milnor fibre and we denote by r a common multiple of the cardinalities of the orbits of in order to trivialize the monodromy we consider the base change t t t tr xt x t t g x f t t we claim that xt is irreducible since red x 0 6 also reg x 0 6 and there are smooth points of x 0 arbitrary close to 0 if z is an irreducible component of xt then z x since x is irreducible it follows that g 1 0 is contained in every irreducible component of xt since g 1 0 is 63 isomorphic to x 0 it has smooth points z arbitrary close to x 0 by lemma 8 1 xt is smooth at z and z cannot be in the intersection of two components of xt i e xt is irreducible since the monodromy of g acts trivially on the irreducible components of the milnor fibre of g by the choice of the base change we can apply lemma 8 1 and get that the milnor fibre of g and hence the milnor fibre of f is irreducible 2 we proceed by induction on r 2 let fi denote the restriction of f to xi the assumption implies that red x 0 xi 6 for i 1 r hence the milnor fibre of fi is connected by 1 if r 2 then red x 0 x 1 x 2 6 since g f is connected and proposotion 8 3 implies that the milnor fibre of f is connected if r 2 let i be a leaf of a spanning tree of g f such that the graph g f obtained from g f by deleting i remains connected after a renumeration we may assume that i 1 let f be the restriction of f to x x 2 xr then g f g f is connected and hence the milnor fibre of f is connected by induction hypothesis since the milnor fibre of f 1 is connected the milnor fibre of f is connected by proposotion 8 3 proposition 8 3 let x x be the union of two reduced subgerms x 1 x and x 2 x and let fi be the restriction of f to x i i 1 2 assume that the milnor fibres of fi are connected and that red x 0 x 1 x 2 6 then the milnor fibre of f is connected proof note that we do not assume that x 1 or x 2 are irreducible if x contains irreducible components that are mapped to 0 by f we omit them as they do not affect the milnor fibre hence we may assume that f is flat then the fi are flat too and we have for the fibres x i t of fi xt x 1 t x 2 t t t as sets we prove now that f x 1 x 2 6 0 choose y red x 0 x 1 x 2 arbitrary close to x and consider the commutative diagram with exact rows and with vertical arrows induced by multiplication with f o ocn y ox y o i and oxi y o ii 0 o i o i 1 o i 2 o i 1 i 2 f 0 0 o i o i 1 o i 2 o i 1 i 2 0 64 the two first vertical arrows are injective by flatness and hence we get from the snake lemma the exact sequence 0 ker f o i f o i 1 f o i 2 f i e ker f i 1 f i 2 f i f the numerator defines x 10 y x 20 y and the denominator x 0 y which coincide as sets therefore the radicals of the ideals coincide and since x 0 y is reduced ker f 0 it follows that f x 1 x 2 y is flat hence open showing that f x 1 x 2 6 0 then z x 1 x 2 such that f z t 6 0 and hence z x 1 t x 2 t since xit is connected it follows that xt is connected theorem 8 2 has the following immediate corollary corollary 8 4 let f x x c 0 be a morphism of complex germs with x 0 x reduced then the milnor fibre of f is connected example 8 5 the following examples are meant to illustrate the previous results f denotes the milnor fibre of f and in 1 4 x 0 c 2 0 1 f x y x 2 here f is not connected x 0 is nowhere reduced 2 f x y xy x 0 is reduced and f is irreducible 3 f x y xy 2 f is irreducible note that x 0 is not reduced but has reduced points arbitrarily close to 0 4 f x y x 2 y 3 here f is irreducible as one can see by using the un ramified covering f c x y 7 y theorem 8 2 is not applicable as x 0 is nowhere reduced however one can see that the acts mon odromy is trivially on h 0 f hence the irreducibility of f follows also from lemma 8 1 5 x xy 0 c 3 f x y z z x is reducible x 0 is reduced and f is connected but not irreducible further examples with reduced x 0 and connected f with several irreducible components are given in example 9 11 1 2 6 x x 1 x 2 with x 1 x y 0 x 2 u v 0 c 4 and f x y u v x y u v we have x 0 x y u v 0 u v x y 0 with an embedded component y v x u u 2 0 65 at 0 here x 0 x 1 x 2 0 thus the assumptions of theorem 8 2 are not satisfied and f consists of 2 disjoint lines for another example with 3 irreducible components that do not satisfy the assumptions of theorem 8 2 and with disconnected milnor fibre see example 9 11 4 examples 1 and 6 show that the assumption of theorem 8 2 can in general not be weakened we consider now the behavior of the invariant in a flat family of inns of arbitrary dimension since r we get immediately from theorem 7 14 iv proposition 8 6 let f x x c 0 be flat with x 0 x an isolated non normal singularity for a good representative f x t and t tr 0 we have x 0 xt x 0 xt r 1 x x dimcw o x 0 o x 0 red x 0 this result was stated in brg 90 lemma 2 4 1 for families of curves without the term x 0 which was mistakenly omitted we will show by examples at the end of this section that this term may appear and is re sponsible for being in general not semicontinuous and that constant does not imply constant semicontinuity of follows if x 0 0 i e if x 0 is reduced moreover in this case constant characterizes simultaneous weak normalizability of f theorem 8 7 let f x x c 0 be flat dim x x 2 and x 0 x an inns if x 0 x is reduced equivalently depth x x 2 then r 1 x x 0 and the following holds for a good representative f x t 1 x 0 xt x 0 xt dimcw o x 0 ox 0 t t r 0 in particular is upper semicontinuous 2 xt is constant iff xt and r xt are constant for t t 3 xt xt is constant for t t iff x x is a simultaneous weak normalization of f 4 x 0 x is reduced in the following cases i x 0 x is reduced 66 ii x is locally irreducible proof since f is flat we get from proposition 7 9 iv that x 0 x is reduced iff depth x x 2 and r 1 x x r 1 x x 0 hence 1 follows from proposition 8 6 2 if xt and r xt are constant then xt is constant by the defi nition of if xt is constant then xt is constant by 1 and by the semicontinuity of 3 by 1 xt xt is constant iff w o x 0 ox 0 i e iff x 0 is weakly normal then w x 0 x 0 is the weak normalization of x 0 and hence x t xt is the weak normalization for all t 4 i if x 0 x is reduced then depth x x 2 by proposition 7 9 iv and hence depth x x 2 by bf 93 ii if x is locally irreducible then r 1 x x 0 and the weak normal ization coincides with the normalization x hence x 0 x 0 is reduced by proposition 7 9 i the most drastic difference between families of reduced and non reduced inns is that in the non reduced case the milnor fibre xt may have several connected components proposition 8 8 gives a precise answer about the number of connected components using a primary decomposition and com putations such as in example 5 8 this number can be effectively computed part 1 of the following result was proved for isolated curve singularities in brg 90 proposition 8 8 let f x x c 0 be active dim x x 2 x 0 x an isolated non normal singularity and xt the milnor fibre of f 1 if r 1 x x 0 then b 0 xt b 0 x r x 2 if r 1 x x 6 0 then b 0 xt b 0 x 1 r x x 10 x with x 10 x dimc ox 1 x f isolated points of xt t 6 0 r 1 x x proof since x and xred as well as xt and x red t are topologically the same spaces we may assume that x is reduced and that f is flat 1 let r 1 x x 0 if x x is irreducible then xt is connected for t 6 0 by proposition 8 2 since dim x 0 x 1 and x 0 r x is reduced 67 now let x be reducible with xi i 1 r the irreducible components fi the restriction of f to xi and xi t the milnor fibre of fi then xt is the union of the xi t and xi t is connected by the previous step we claim that xi t xj t 6 for i 6 j iff xi xj 6 x note that xi xj x 0 x since x is normal at y x 0 r x therefore xi xj 6 x iff f xi xj is at least 1 dimensional i e xi t xj t f xi xj 1 t 6 this proves the claim to see 2 let x 1 be the union of the 1 dimensional irreducible compo nents of x by remark 7 8 r 1 x x isolated points of xt x 10 the result follows from 1 since the number of connected components of xt is the number of its positive dimensional components plus the number of its isolated points apart from the number of connected components we cannot say much about the topology of the milnor fibre for an arbitrary inns this is different for families of generically reduced curves to which we switch in the next section 9 topology of families of generically reduced curves we consider families of generically reduced curve singularities f x x c 0 with x x a surface singularity i e a 2 dimensional complex germ we have xred x x 2 x x 1 x with xi x the pure i dimensional part of xred x x x is pure 2 dimensional if xred x x 2 x i e if r 1 x x 0 but x x may not be reduced let us now investigate constant families for families of reduced curves constant along a section is equivalent to topological triviality by theorem 2 9 we show by an example below that this is in general not true for families of non reduced curve singularities nevertheless the nice thing about is that it determines the euler characteristic of the milnor fibre in a family of generically reduced curves theorem 9 1 let f x x c 0 be flat with x 0 x an isolated curve singularity and f x t a good representative then the following holds 1 x 0 xt xred 0 xredt x 2 0 0 for t t r 0 68 2 x 0 xt xred 0 xredt 1 xt for t t proof 1 is a special case of theorem 7 14 2 the equality x 0 xt 1 xt was proved in brg 90 satz 3 1 2 the proof is completely topological using the reducedness of the mil nor fibre of f since xt x red t for all t the second equality follows it follows of course also easily from 1 and the definition of corollary 9 2 with the assumption of theorem 9 1 we have for t t 1 xt is constant iff xt is constant 2 the following are equivalent i xt b 0 xt is constant ii b 1 xt 0 iii each connected component of xt is contractible proof the equivalence of iii to the other statements in 2 follows as in bug 80 theorem 4 2 4 even if lacks if x 0 x is not reduced some of the well known proper ties like semicontinuity the above results show that always controls the euler characteristic of the milnor fibre of an arbitrary isolated curve singu larity this is somewhat surprising as x 0 x may have a rather complicated embedded component in the following theorem we use the notion of weak simultaneous resolu tion for families with non reduced fibres if x is a non reduced space we say that x x is a resolution of singularities if x is reduced and if the induced map x xred is a resolution of singularities in the classical sense then the notion of very weak resp weak resp strong simultane ous resolution from definition 2 1 carries over verbatim for investigating topological triviality we have to assume that xt t t has only one singular point along a section theorem 9 3 let f x x c 0 be a deformation with section of the isolated curve singularity x 0 x and f x t a good representative with section t x such that xt r t is smooth for t t then the following are equivalent 69 i x x is pure 2 dimensional and f x t admits a weak simulta neous resolution ii x x is pure 2 dimensional and xt t and r x t are con stant iii xt is constant and xt is connected for t t iv xt is connected and h 1 xt c 0 for t t v x 0 and xt are embedded topologically equivalent for t t vi f x t is topologically trivial proof we prove the following implications i ii ks iii ks ks vi 3 iv v 3 ks ii i since r 1 x x 0 xt constant implies very weak si multaneous resolution by theorem 7 17 since r xt t 1 t is constant 1 t red 1 x red t over t and we get i i vi the proof is the same as in bug 80 4 6 vi iv trivial iv v v iv is trivial while the proof for iv v is the same as in bug 80 3 5 it only needs the connectedness of the milnor fibre but not the reducedness of x 0 x iv iii follows from corollary 7 11 2 iii ii since iii iv was already proved we can use that there is a homeomorphism h b x 0 x b xt t for some em bedding x b t with f the restricton of the second projection hence h x 0 r x xtr t and x 0 r x and xtr t have the same number of connected components since xt is connected and xt r t is smooth the number of connected components of xt r t is equal to the number of global irreducible components of xt t t and all irreducible compo nents of xt meet at t therefore r xt t is constant together with xt t constant we get xt t constant moreover xt con nected implies that xt has no isolated points i e r 1 x x 0 and hence 70 ii follows remark 9 4 the equivalence of i ii and vi was proved by l c ng tr nh in lc 15 theorem 4 5 for x x pure dimensional and reduced using corollary 9 7 below note however that the constancy of the milnor number is not sufficient to guarantee ii see example 9 11 4 we need now a local bertini theorem for a generic linear projection f x 0 c 0 due to flenner fl 77 f is called a generic linear projection if it is the restriction to x 0 cn 0 of a linear projection cn 0 c 0 x 1 xn 7 1 x 1 nxn with 1 n cn generic f 1 0 is called a generic hyperplane section lemma 9 5 let x 0 cn 0 be a complex germ of positive dimension and f x 0 c 0 a generic linear projection then the following holds for a good representative f x t i f is active on x ii let x 0 be reduced then f is flat on x and for all t t the fibre xt is smooth at y iff y is a smooth point of x i e sing f sing x proof i f is active iff no irreducible component of x 0 is contained in the linear subspace 1 0 which can be achieved for a generic since dim x 0 0 ii the flatness is an immediate consequence of i that f 1 0 reg x is smooth is proved in fl 77 4 1 satz f 1 t reg x is smooth for t 6 0 by lemma 8 1 1 conversely if xt y is smooth then x y is smooth by proposition 6 1 2 from theorem 9 3 we deduce corollary 9 6 let x x be a reduced pure dimensional surface singularity with smooth 1 dimensional singular locus a good representative f x t of a generic linear projection makes x a topologically trivial family of curves iff the normalization x of x becomes an analytically trivial family of smooth curves 71 proof we can choose a generic f such that sing x is finite and smooth over t i e there is a section t sing x of f moreover f is flat on x and f 1 t r t is smooth by lemma 9 5 now we can apply theorem 9 3 the following consequence is due to j fern ndez de bobadilla j snoussi and m spivakovsky bss 16 theorem 4 4 corollary 9 7 bobadilla snoussi spivakovsky if a reduced pure dimensional surface singularity x with smooth 1 dimensional singular locus is a topologically trivial family of curves then x is smooth as another corollary we can characterize strong simultaneous resolutions for families of generically reduced curves which follows from theorem 9 3 and lemma 9 10 let mt denote the hilbert samuel multiplicity corollary 9 8 with the assumptions of theorem 9 3 f x t admits a strong simultaneous resolution iff any of the conditions i vi hold and if mt xt t is constant for t t remark 9 9 1 in bt 08 j j nu o ballesteros and j n tomazella study the milnor number f for a finite morphism f x 0 0 c 0 x 0 0 a reduced curve singularity in the sense of v goryunov d mond and d van straten they define m 1 x 0 0 f for f a generic linear projection and prove based on bug 80 a greuel l type formula m 1 x 0 0 x 0 0 mt x 0 0 1 they show that m 1 xt t being constant in a family f x t as above with x 0 reduced is equivalent to whitney equisingularity 2 if we define m 1 x 0 0 by the above formula for a generically reduced curve singularity and with x 0 0 as in definition 5 2 we get from corollary 9 8 if f x x c 0 is a deformation with section of the generically reduced curve singularity x 0 x such that xt r t is smooth then f x t admits a strong simultaneous resolution xt is connected and m 1 xt t is constant it would be interesting to study properties and m 1 for functions on a gener ically reduced curve or more generally on an inns of arbitrary dimension 72 the following lemma is well known for reduced curve singularities using that mt xt t mt x red t t by the additivity formula of serre cf se 65 v 3 the proof is the same as in the reduced case lemma 9 10 let f x x s 0 be a deformation with section of an isolated curve singularity x 0 x with s 0 reduced x x pure dimensional and xsr s smooth for s s then a weak simultaneous resolution along s is strong iff mt xs s s s is constant proof let x x be a weak simultaneous resolution of f x s and let x 10 x x r 0 x be the branches of x 0 x then r is also the number of irreducible components of xs s s s and of x x by theorem 9 3 then can be given as a deformation of the parametrization of x 0 0 c 0 x 0 r i 1 x i 0 i r i 1 c s 0 x 0 cn s 0 ti s 7 xi 1 ti s xi n ti s s with xi j ti s xi j ti s ai j ti s i 1 r j 1 n such that ti 7 xi 1 ti xi n ti is a parametrization of xi 0 0 then w s 0 s and w 1 w is the disjoint union of the w i defined by the ideal ii xi 1 ti s xi n ti s in ox i 0 i c ti x 1 0 0 1 0 r is defined by the ideals xi 1 ti xi n ti tmic ti in c ti where mi min ord xi 1 ord xi n is the multiplicity of xi 0 0 hence w 1 0 s iff ii tmic ti s i e iff mi min ordti xi 1 ti s ordti xi n ti s but this is equivalent to mi min ordxi 1 s ordxi n s mt xis 0 for each fixed s s sufficiently close to 0 since mt xs 0 mt x red s 0 r i 1 mt xis 0 and since the multiplicity is semicontinuous w 1 0 s iff mt xs s is constant this proves the lemma we illustrate the previous results by several examples example 9 11 in example 1 2 4 f x c is the projection to the t axis 73 1 let x c 4 be the reduced surface consiting of 3 planes and defined by the ideal xz xy yz zt with depth x 0 2 x 0 is the reduced curve singularity consisting of the 3 coordinate axes in c 3 while xt consists of 3 lines meeting in two ordinary nodes this family is constant and constant with xt xt r xt 2 2 let x c 4 be defined by xz xy yz yt zt again reduced pure 2 dimensional of depth 2 x consists of a plane and a surface with an a 1 singularity meeting in the t axis we have x 0 as in 1 but for t 6 0 the milnor fibre xt is the union of two smooth curves meeting in an a 1 singularity in 0 we smoothed away one a 1 singularity in 1 hence xt xt r xt 1 the family is constant x and all fibres are weakly normal and id x x is the weak normalization of f in accordance with theorem 8 7 3 3 consider x c 4 defined by x y u v and let f x y u v x y u v x is the 1 point union of 2 planes with depth x 0 1 x 0 consists of 2 lines through 0 with an embedded component of length x 0 1 and xt consists of 2 disjoint lines for t 6 0 we get x 0 0 r x 0 1 x 0 1 and xt r xt xt 0 in this example x is reduced and pure 2 dimensional with xt not upper semicontinuous 4 let x c 6 be the reduced surface with 3 components given by x 2 y y 2 x t x 2 y 4 w t v y x w u y x the first ideal of the intersection describes the deformation from a d 4 singularity to an a 3 singularity the other 2 ideals describe 2 planes that meet in 0 x has depth 1 x 0 consists of a d 4 singularity and 2 lines with an embedded point of length x 0 1 the general fibre xt is a reduced curve consisting of an a 3 singularity at 0 a line through 0 and another disjoint line we get x 0 r x 0 x 0 4 and xt 3 r xt 2 xt 4 this family is constant along the trivial section the t axis but not constant the computation for these examples were done with singular dgps 15 similar to the computations in example 5 8 74 10 comments open problems and conjectures 10 1 equisingularitiy for families of generically reduced curves the theory of equisingularity for familes of plane curves is well understood since many years part of it has been reviewed in section 1 with emphasis on topological equisingularity and simultaneous resolution in section 2 we considered the case of families of reduced but not neces sarily plane curve singularities based on bug 80 this had been continued in bgg 80 who investigated stronger conditions e g whitney regularity and equisaturation equisingular families of plane curve singularities with embedded points have been studied by a nobile no 95 families of generi cally reduced curves have been considered in brg 90 in bss 16 and in this paper but several questions remain still open which we are going to discuss in this section general assumption let x x be a surface singularity f x x c 0 flat with x 0 x f 1 0 x an isolated curve singularity and f x t a good representative with generically reduced curves as fibres we keep also the other notations from section 7 if x 0 x is reduced equivalent to x x cohen macaulay then x x is pure dimensional and reduced and if t x is a section of f such that xt r t is smooth we have the following implications shown in the es diagram below diagram taken from bgg 80 1 topological triviality

we consider 3 iv zariski s discrimininant criterion we have l xt t x t 0 xt t with x t the plane curve ob tained by a generic projection of xt t to c 2 0 c 4 xt t denotes 75 the cone of limits of tangent vectors at xt r t and c 5 xt t the cone of limits of secant vectors the implications 1 2 2 2 are due to bug 80 3 3 4 4 and 4 3 to bgg 80 3 1 to thom mather 3 3 to teissier and 3 3 and 4 4 to stutz reference see bgg 80 conjecture 1 topological triviality means the existence of a homeomor phism of pairs h x t x 0 t x t over t in bug 80 this was shown to be equivalent to the existence of homeomorphisms ht b x 0 0 b xt t for each t t we conjecture that the home omorphisms ht t t can be glued to one homeomorphism providing em bedded topological triviality the question is whether there exists a homeo morphism of triples h b t x t b t c 0 t x t over t this question was communicated to me by o nogueira and j snoussi it is purely topological independent from x and x 0 being reduced or not the proof of non embedded topological triviality in bug 80 used for x 0 cn n 3 a theorem by lickorish about the unknotting of cones in high codimension a proof of the conjecture would require a generalization about the simultaneous unknotting of cones in a 1 parametric family or a direct construction using vector fields as in ti 77 remark added in proof fern ndez de bobadilla communicated to me that conjecture 1 has a positive answer in section 2 of his paper bo 13 he introduces the notion of cuts and a technique for topological trivialization using the same arguments as in his generalization of timourian s result con jecture 1 follows according to bobadilla problem 2 in brg 90 and in this paper we prove 1 2 2 and 3 3 for families of generically reduced curves we also show 1 2 while 2 1 holds only if the general fibre xt is connected it is open which of the remaining implications of the es diagram above hold for families of generically reduced curves resp which additional as sumptions have to be made 76 problem 3 zariski s discrimininant criterion for equisingularity of plane curves is also not fully understood in general for generically reduced curves let x x be a pure dimensional surface singularity and x x c 2 0 a finite morphism the image sing of the singular locus of is called the discriminant of zariski s discriminant criterion 3 iv says that for a generic linear projec tion the restriction to x x of a linear projection from an ambient space the reduced discriminant is smooth the following was proved in bug 80 theorem 6 2 7 let f x x c 0 be flat with x 0 x a reduced complete intersection curve and let x x c 0 be a generic projection then 1 f x x c 2 0 satisfies zariskis discriminant criterion iff a good representative f x t admits a section such that xt r t is smooth and xt t and mt xt t are constant for t t this result was complemented in bgg 80 theoreme ii 5 where the authors show that zariski s discriminant criterion is equivalent to whitney regularity of x i e sing x is smooth and the pair xrsing x sing x satisfies the whitney conditions a and b in bss 16 theorem 3 1 the authors generalize this to the following let x x be reduced and irreducible with 1 dimensional smooth sin gular locus then zariski s discriminant criterion is equivalent to whitney regularity it remains still open whether the irreducibility and reducedness in this theorem is necessary in our general setting more generally which implica tions between 3 iv 3 3 and 3 hold under the assumptions of theo rem 7 13 of this paper where 3 means that xt t r xt t and mt x t are constant we like to add that for hypersurfaces of arbitrary dimension li 00 the orem 3 2 shows that a zariski equisingular stratification defined by con stancy of dimensionality type is indeed a whitney stratification problem 4 study properties of the milnor number f introduced by goryunov mond and van straten and the invariant m 1 x 0 introduced by nu o ballesteros and tomazella for functions f on a generically reduced curve or more generally on an inns of arbitrary dimension see remark 9 9 in particular their behaviour under deformations and their relation to other equisingularity conditions 77 some of the questions in problem 1 2 and 4 should have an easy answer for families of generically reduced curves given the results of the present paper the invariants from the es diagram and from problem 4 may be studied for families of higher dimensional inns and related to equisingular ity questions we can however not expect that the invariants r mt are meaningful enough to study the topology e g the higher homology groups of the milnor fiber in such families 10 2 deformation of the normalization and of the parametriza tion let c 0 cn 0 be a reduced curve singularity and consider the diagram c 0 n c 0 j cn 0 with j the given embedding n the normalization and the parametrization of c 0 we compare deformations of n and of by definition a defor mation of a morphism includes the deformation of the source and the target cf appendix deformations of n are hence at least as complicated as de formations of c 0 on the other hand deformations of are very simple as c 0 and cn 0 are both smooth they can be explicitly described as in section 4 just with n components insteady of 2 for plane curves however deformations of and of n are up to isomor phism the same thing as we explained in remark 4 4 and the same holds for deformations with section cf gls 07 proposition 2 23 this identifica tion allowed us in theorem 3 1 to relate the base space of the semiuniversal deformation of with the constant stratum in the seminuniversal defor mation of c 0 consider now for c 0 cn 0 a 1 parametric deformation of x x c c 0 cn c 0 pr c 0 and let x x cn c 0 be the image of which is analytic since is finite if we endow x x with its reduced structure then the restriction of 78 pr to x x f x x c 0 is flat if x x is not cohen macaulay then x 0 x has an embedded com ponent and induces a deformation of x 0 x but not of c 0 xred 0 x therefore we cannot expect a similar relation between the semiuniversal de formations of and of c 0 as for plane curves nevertheless c 0 has a semiuniversal deformation which we denote by dc 0 bc 0 consider the restriction of to the constant stratum bc of and let d be the pullback of via the normalization map then is flat and a constant deformation of the reduced curve singularity c 0 over a normal base space by theorem 2 4 the normalization d m d is a simultaneous normalization of since the deformation can be embedded we get a deformation of the normalization of c 0 d m 1 0 d 0 c n 0 0 and the composition d m 1 0 cn 0 0 is a defor mation of the parmaetrization hence can be induced from the semi nuniversal deformation d b of by some morphism b is only unique up to first order but nevertheless we may suggest in view of theorem 3 1 problem 5 what can be said about in particular about its image in b in general probably not much since deformations of are unobstructed while deformations of c 0 can be arbitrary complicated it is still an open problem whether there exist non smooth rigid reduced curve singularities it might nevertheless be interesting to study special classes of curves such as complete intersections or reduced curves in c 3 0 for both classes the semiuniversal deformation can be explicitly described and has a smooth base space for the latter case see brg 90 proposition 6 3 note that in any case we have an explicit description of the semiuniversal deformation of any deformation of c 0 cn 0 is given as in section 4 with n components instead of 2 also the semiuniversal deformation of is anal ogous to the case of plane curves which is explicitly described in gls 07 proposition ii 2 27 we have to use a basis of t 1 c 0 cn 0 which is the same as m 0 in gls 07 but now with n components see grl 08 theorem 1 3 79 for an isolated curve singularity c 0 cn 0 we can define equisingu larity by any of the es conditions i e conditions of the es diagram including zariski s discriminant criterion 3 iv above so far mainly 1 parametric de formations have been considered even for reduced curves the following problem appears natural problem 6 for a generically reduced curve singularity c 0 study de formations that satisfy any of the es conditions over a reduced base space of arbitrary dimension in particular does a versal es deformation to be understood in the category of reduced complex spaces exist what can be said about the base space if it exists e g smoothness irreducibil ity note that for reduced plane curve singularities the restriction to the constant stratum of the semiuniversal deformation is a seminuniversal zariski equisingular deformation may be the case of complete intersections or of reduced curves in c 3 0 is more feasible 10 3 simultaneous normalization our main new result about simultaneous normalization is theorem 7 17 resp its global version theorem 7 19 it says that a flat morphism f x x c 0 with x 0 x a positive dimensional inns is equinormalizable iff f is constant and without isolated points in the fibres we conjecture that this result extends to familes over a normal base space conjecture 7 let f x x s s be flat with s s normal such that the non normal locus nnor f finite over s and dim x 0 x 1 then f is equinormalizable iff f ist constant and without isolated points in the fibres a proof of this conjecture would be an important step to answer some of the questions posed in problem 6 the conjecture was proved by l c ng tr nh lc 15 theorem 3 6 for families of isolated curve singulrities under the assumption that s s is smooth and x x reduced and pure dimensional with normalization x x being cohen macaulay we may ask whether in our local situation the functor of simultaneous normalizations is representable as this was proved by kolla r 6 13 for pro jective morphisms it would probably be of great help to prove conjecture 7 problem 8 let f x x s s be a morphism of complex germs and consider the functor simnor f from complex germs to sets associating to 80 a germ t t the set t t s s f admits a simultaneous normalization over t t show that this functor is representable if the fibres of f are generically re duced without isolated points and if nnor f is finite over s s may be one has to assume that s s is normal or weakly normal concerning projective morphisms chiang hsieh and lipman pose the question why the hilbert polynomial a global object should be involved in the characterization of simultaneous normalization which is a purely local phenomenon moreover they ask if there are local invariants somehow related to the hilbert polynomial that characterize equinormalizability at a point this question makes sense also for local analytic morphisms when no hilbert polynomial is available problem 9 let f x x s s by a morphism of complex germs does there exist numerical invariants of a complex space such that their constancy along the fibres characterizes the existence of a simultaneous normalization of f one may think of certain multiplicities associated to the non normal locus to hyperplane sections of various dimensions or to strata of a strat ification we have seen that our invariant gives a positive answer if the non normal locus of f is finite over s s and if s s c 0 and we conjecture it for s s normal 10 4 equisingularity in positive characteristic equisingular deformations of plane algebroid isolated curve singularities r k x y f k an algebraically closed field of characteristic p 0 have been studied in cgl 07 a and cgl 07 b using zariski s definition of equisingularity requiring equimultiplicity along sections through successive blowing up points the aim was to prove smoothness of the equisingular ity stratum in the semiuniversal deformation of the equation as well as of the parametrization we do not go into details here but like to mention that the parametric approach works very much like in characteristic 0 while deformations of the equation may depend on the characteristic for small p in particular the base space of the semiuniversal es deformation of the parametrization is always smooth while this holds for deformations of the equation only in good characteristic furthermore the classification of iso lated hypersurface singularities has been started in grk 90 and in grn 16 81 otherwise not very much is known about equisingularity in positive charac teristic in particular the conditions at the beginning of section 8 1 have not been systematically studied for algebroid curve singularities therefore one might consider the following problem problem 10 let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 and c an isolated algebroid curve singularity i e c spec r with r k x 1 xn i a 1 dimensional analytic ring such spec r rm is regular m the maximal ideal of r the problem is to study the es conditions at the beginning of section 10 1 and their relations for 1 parametric deformations of r whenever they make sense the algebraic framework for this in even greater generality has been developed in cl 06 for r reduced the authors prove there that for de formations over a normal base space the family is equinormalizable iff it is constant even for perfect fields finally the following problem seems to be of general interest e g in the context of generalized jacobians problem 11 let c be an isolated algebroid plane curve singularity de fined over an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic is the nor malization of the constant stratum in the semiuniversal deformation of c smooth more generally does theorem 3 1 hold in this situation 11 appendix deformation categories and functors for the convenience of the reader we collect notations and definitions concerning deformations of complex spaces resp of germs and good rep resentatives to be used throughout this article as a general reference we refer to gls 07 1 let x s and t s be morphisms of complex spaces 4 we denote by xt the fibre product of x with t over s giving rise to a 4 we always assume that a complex space is separated and has a countable basis of the topology 82 cartesian diagram x s t xt x t s with called the pull back of if s s then xs 1 s denotes the fibre of over s s is called the base space or the parameter space of analogous notations are used for morphisms of complex space germs 2 let x x and s s be complex germs a deformation of x x over s s consists of a flat morphism x x s s of complex germs together with a isomorphism i x x xs x hence it is given by a diagram as in 1 with flat but for germs we denote a deformation by i or just by 3 let f x x t t be a morphism of complex germs a deforma tion of the morphism f over a complex germ s s is a cartesian diagram x x f i x x f t t ji t t p pt s s with i and j closed embeddings p and flat hence deformations of t t resp of x x over s s and pt the reduced point we denote it by i j f p or just by f p a deformation with compatible sections of f is a deformation f p together with sections s s t t of p and s s x x of such that f 4 a morphism of two deformations of f i j f p over s s and i j f p over s s is given by morphism 1 x x x x 2 t t t t and s 0 s s such that the obvious diagram commutes forgetting the upper square of the diagram in 3 we get a morphism of deformations of t t if s s s s we always assume id a morphism of deformations with sections is given by morphisms 1 and 2 that commute with the sections 83 5 deformations of f form a category of deformations of f denoted by def f def f s s denotes the subcategory of def f consisting of deformations of f over s s with being the identity on s s the category of deformations of x x are denoted by def x x the di agram in 3 shows that we have forgetful functors def f def x x and def f def t t the categories of deformations with section are denoted by def secf and def secf s s and similar for x x instead of f 6 let s s s s be a morphism and f p a deformation of f over s s the pull backs of f and p give rise to a deformation of f over s s the induced deformation by if we denote by def f s s the set of isomorphism classes of deformations of f over s s then we get a functor def f category of complex space germs category of sets mapping s s to def f s s and a morphism of complex germs to the induced deformation this is called the deformation functor of f similar notations are used for deformations of x x and for deformations with section 7 we denote by t the complex space consisting of one point with local ring c c c 2 0 deformations over t are called infinites imal deformations for isomorphism classes of deformations over t we use the notion t 1 x x def x x t t 1 f def f t and t 1 sec def sec t for deformations with section note that these sets are complex vector spaces cf gls 07 section ii 1 4 and appendix c 8 let x x be a complex subgerm of cn 0 a deformation x x s s of x x with section is isomorphic to an embedded deformation with trivial section that is there exists a commu tative diagram x x i x x cn s 0 s pr ww pt s s dd 84 with x x embedded in cn s 0 s pr the secod projection and s s 0 s s cf gls 07 prop ii 1 5 need not be flat 9 let x x s s be a morphism with fibre isomorphic to x x cn 0 and with s s ck 0 choose an embedding of as in 8 and let b cn resp d ck be open balls around 0 of radius resp and x b a closed subspace of b representing x x if s d resp x b s are closed subspaces representing s s resp x x and if 0 are sufficiently small depending on the required properties of then pr x x s is called a good representative of x x s s by identifying b t with b we usually consider the fibres xt t s of as subsets of b and identify the central fibre xs with x talking about good representatives we allow and to shrink during an argument if necessary b is called a milnor ball if is sufficiently small
