convergence of volume forms on a degenerating holomorphic family of log calabi yau varieties to a non archimedean measure extending a result of boucksom and jonsson more precisely let x b be a holomorphic family of sub log canonical log calabi yau complex varieties parameterized by the punctured unit disk let be a meromorphic volume form on x with poles along b we show that the possibly infinite measures induced by the restriction of the to a fiber converge to a measure on the berkovich analytification as we approach the puncture the convergence takes place on a hybrid space which is obtained by filling in the space x b with the aforementioned berkovich space over the puncture 1 introduction if y is an irreducible normal and compact complex analytic space such that we have a top dimensional meromorphic form on the smooth locus y reg and a divisor d y such that is holomorphic and does not vanish on y reg d and has poles given exactly by d then the pair y d is called log calabi yau any two such forms and on y reg which have poles given by d will be unique up to a scalar factor the form gives rise to the volume form i dimy 2 on y reg d and thus a positive measure on y for a log calabi yau y d this measure is unique up to scaling note that locally near d and y sing it is possible for the mass to be infinite when d 0 y is said to be calabi yau families of log calabi yau varieties appear in many settings for example in ge ometry and mirror symmetry bat 94 it would be natural to ask how this canonical measure varies along families of log calabi yau varieties the main motivation for our problem comes from bj 17 where boucksom and jonsson studied this canon ical measure along families of calabi yau varieties we extend some of the results to families of log calabi yau varieties let x d be a proper flat family of irreducible normal complex analytic spaces let b x be a q weil divisor such that kx d b is q cartier and is q linearly equivalent to 0 then xt b xt is log calabi yau for t 1 using the above recipe we can obtain measures t on each of the fibers xt for t 1 two such families t and t would differ by a factor of h t 2 m where h is a holomorphic function on d and m is an integer our goal is to understand if the measure t converge in some sense as t 0 meromorphic form on x reg t with poles along bt x reg t which gives rise to a volume form on x reg t bt and hence a possibly infinite positive measure t on date november 19 2019 1 http arxiv org abs 1911 07307 v 1 2 sanal shivaprasad xt bt even if m 6 1 we can still obtain a measure t on xt bt using for more details see section 4 3 we would like to understand the asymptotics and the convergence of t as t 0 top dimensional meromorphic form on xt with poles along bt b xt then i t t is a volume form on xt bt which gives rise to a measure t on xt bt one way to study the convergence would be to think of the measures t as being measures on x with support xt however since there is no fiber over the origin the measures t converge weakly to the zero measure on x as t 0 which is not very interesting this is where non archimedean geometry comes in handy we restrict our attention to the case when the pair x b is projective and meromorphic over d i e x is a closed subset of pn d for some n n and x and b are cut out by homoge neous polynomials whose coefficients are holomorphic function on d and meromorphic on d the pair x b has analytical singularities at 0 i e there exists a proper variety x over d with x d x there exists a line bundle l extending kx d b and a global section of l which extends the generating section of kx d used to define t such an x is called a model of x for x b satisfying the first condition above we can can construct varieties xc t andbc t over the non archimedean field c t by considering the coefficients of the polynomials cutting out x and b as elements of c t the berkovich analytification of a variety y over the field c t denoted y an is a topological space whose points are valuations on the residue fields of scheme points in y that extend the t adic valuation on c t ber 93 ber 90 by considering the berkovich analytifications we obtain compact hausdorff spaces xan c t and ban c t the main tool that we use to study the asymptotics of t is a hybrid space var ious hybrid spaces i e spaces which are obtained by gluing complex analytic spaces with non archimedean spaces have been constructed in the literature they have been used to study compactifications oda 18 and degenerations fav 16 bj 17 ps 19 hybrid spaces were used in bj 17 to answer to prove theorem a below for sub klt pairs x b following ks 06 ber 09 bj 17 we construct a hybrid topo logical space x b hyb which as a set is a disjoint union of x b and xan c t ban c t the topology on the hybrid space is given by the logarithmic rate of convergence see section 3 for more details we have the following convergence theorem for measures on x b hyb theorem a suppose x b is as above in addition assume that the pair x b is sub log canonical then there exists a measure 0 on x an c t bc t and constants d n and min q such that the measures t t 2 min 2 log t 1 d converge weakly to 0 when viewed as measures on x b hyb the measure 0 is easy to describe when x b is log smooth i e when x is smooth and b has snc support see section 4 in this case the support of 0 is the locus where a certain weight function associated to x b constructed in mn 15 bm 19 is minimized the minimizing locus of the weight function is called as the essential skeleton in the literature and thus we have that the our measure 0 is supported on the essential skeleton in general the support of 0 is the image of a skeleton under a birational map x b x b and its support is the generalization of the essential skeleton constructed by temkin in tem 16 if the non archimedean degenerations of volume forms 3 pair x b is not sub log canonical then there is no reasonable convergence in this non archimedean setting see example 4 3 1 for more details this is consistent with the observation that the essential skeleton of x b is empty when x b is not sub log canonical as an application of theorem a get a convergence result for a torus t c n we have a canonical embedding rn t an c t given by sending r rn to the valuation m zn amz m 7 maxm am e r m consider the constant family t d and the associated hybrid space t d t an c t then by applying theorem a to a smooth projective toric compactification of t we get that as t 0 the haar measure on t t scaled by a factor of 1 2 log t 1 n converge weakly to the lebesgue measure on rn see examples 4 3 6 and 5 4 4 for more details the motivation for this problem comes from bj 17 where the case for smooth x and b 0 bj 17 theorem a and the case for sub klt pairs bj 17 theorem 8 4 is studied the essential difference in our scenario is that the measures t are no longer finite measures when we drop the assumption that b is sub klt for a smoothx and a smooth model x ofx there is an associated cw complex x given by the dual intersection complex of the central fiber x 0 in bj 17 boucksom and jonsson construct a locally compact hausdorff hybrid space x hyb over d whose fiber over d isx and the fiber over 0 is x then they show that the measures t scaled appropriately converge to a weighted lebesgue measure 0 on a subcomplex of x using this they show a convergence of the measures to a measure on xan we will employ a similar approach to prove theorem a we first prove theorem b below which shows the convergence on certain skeletal subsets ofxan ban since our measures are no longer finite we would have to allow for the limit measures to be infinite and this would not be possible if we use lebesgue measure on a compact simplicial complex the solution is to allow our simplices to have unbounded faces now assume that x b is log smooth and pick a model x such that x 0 b red is an snc divisor a good candidate for this is x b the dual intersection complex of a pair introduced in tyo 12 bpr 13 bpr 16 in the one dimensional case and in grw 16 bm 19 for higher dimensions let x 0 i biei and let y be a stratum of x 0 b i e a connected component of i i ei j j bj then we get a face y r s r i j 0 i i biri 1 of x b these faces are then glued together via some attaching maps to get x b associated to such a model we construct a similar hybrid space x b hyb x b x b where the topology is given by logarithmic rate of convergence we prove the following convergence theorem on the hybrid space note that for theorem b we don t need to assume that x b is projective theorem b let x d be a holomorphic family of proper complex manifolds let b be a snc q divisor such that kx d b q 0 and the pair x b is sub log canonical i e if b j jbj for prime divisors bj then j 1 for all j let x be a smooth proper model of x such that x 0 b is snc let l extend kx d b and let h 0 x ml be a generating section for sufficiently divisible m and let t be the measure induced on xt by then there exists a lebesgue type measure 0 supported on a subcomplex l of x b and explicit constants 4 sanal shivaprasad d n min q such that t t 2 min 2 log t 1 d 0 converges weakly as measures on x b hyb for precise details see section 4 we can view x and x b as subsets of the berkovich analytification xan c t moreover x is a strong deformation retract of x an c t and its image is denoted as sk x in the literature theorem a follows from theorem b by using the following trick which was used in bj 17 the collection of x for all smooth proper snc models x is a directed system andxan c t lim x x see ks 06 theorem 10 bfj 16 corollary 3 2 we prove a similar result see theorem 5 1 1 that xanc t banc t lim x x b the topology on x b hyb is in fact given by x b hyb lim x x b hyb which immediately proves theorem a for smooth x for a general x b by taking a log resolution x b x b and using theorem b for x b we are able to prove theorem a it would interesting to see the application of theorem a to various examples of log calabi yau varieties that are available in the literature man 19 to see if it yields any interesting results in jn 19 jonsson and nicaise prove a p adic version of bj 17 where they consider the measure induced by a pluricanonical form on a smooth proper variety x over a local field k they show that the measures induced by k k k for all finite tame extensions k of k converge to a lebesgue type measure on the berkovich analytification the measures considered in jn 19 are finite and it would be interesting to see whether it would be possible generalize theorem a to this p adic setting to extend the result to a family of infinite measures as well structure of the paper the paper is structured as follows in section 2 we recall the construction of the dual complex x b associated to an snc model x of a log smooth pair x b and in section 3 we recall the construction of the the hybrid space x b hyb associated to a model x in section 4 we prove theorem b in section 5 we construct the space x b hyb realize it and its the central fiber as a non archimedean space and prove theorem a acknowledgments i would like to thank my advisor mattias jonsson for sug gesting this problem and also for his support and guidance this work was sup ported by the nsf grant dms 1600011 2 the dual simplicial complex associated to an snc model in this section we recall the notion of a model and construct the dual intersection complex associated to an snc model of a log smooth pair x b let x be a holomorphic flat family of compact manifolds parametrized by d i e x is a smooth complex manifold with a proper flat map x d let b be an snc q divisor in x write b j jbj where j q and bj are prime divisors in this section we don t need to assume that x b is projective non archimedean degenerations of volume forms 5 p 1 0 0 0 0 figure 1 the dual complex x b for x p 1 d and b 0 d d 2 1 models of x b a model of a pair x b is a complex analytic space x flat over d such that we have a specified isomorphism x d x as spaces over d we say that a model x is snc if x is smooth and x 0 b red is an snc divisor in x we say that x is proper if x is proper over d by abuse of notation we will also denote the closure of b in x by b as well let x 0 i biei denote the central fiber where ei are irreducible components of the central fiber and denote d x 0 b by hironaka s resolution of singularities given a proper model x of x b we can always produce a proper snc model x of x b such that we have a proper map x x which commutes with the projection to d 2 2 the dual complex to an snc model x of x b we can associate a cw complex with possibly open faces x b called the dual complex as follows a non empty connected component y of ei 0 eip bj 1 bjq is called a stratum associated to the stratum y we have a face y x 0 xp y 1 yq rp 1 0 r q 0 i bixi 1 rp 1 0 r q 0 if y is a stratum that contains y then we have attaching maps y y given by sending the extra coordinates to 0 for example if y ei 0 ei p bj 1 bj q for some p p and q q then the map y y is given by x 0 xp y 1 yq 7 x 0 xp 0 0 y 1 yq 0 0 the union of all such faces corresponding to all the strata in x 0 for all p q 0 along with the attaching maps give rise to the cw complex x b for example if dim xt 1 then x b is the dual graph complex of d with the vertices corresponding to b removed the dual complex of a pair was introduced in grw 16 bm 19 the complex x x 0 used in bj 17 is just the subcomplex of x b consisting of all the bounded faces example 2 2 1 the dual complex associated to p 1 d let x p 1 d with projection to d and b 0 d d consider the model x p 1 d then the dual complex x b is homeomorphic to r with 0 being the vertex p 1 0 the positive axis being identified with 0 0 and the negative axis with 0 see figure 1 2 3 integral piecewise affine structure on the dual intersection complex we briefly discuss some results related to the natural integral piecewise affine struc ture on x the reader can take a look at ber 99 ber 04 and bj 17 section 1 3 for more details given a polytope x 0 xp p i 0 bixi 1 r q 0 consider m the collection of affine linear functions with integral coefficients on r p 1 q 0 restricted to and two such functions are identified if they are equal on denote b gcd b 0 bp 6 sanal shivaprasad let 1 m denote the constant function 1 on the evaluation map m r realizes as a possibly unbounded polytope of codimension one in m r contained in the affine plane 1 1 so the tangent space of in m r can be realized as m r where m m q 1 m the lebesgue measure on m r normalized with respect to the lattice homz m z gives rise to a measure on this is called the normalized lebesgue measure of the following remark stated with a typo in bj 17 remark 1 3 gives an explicit description of the normalized lebesgue measure which will be useful for computations we provide a quick proof here for the convenience of the reader proposition 2 3 1 bj 17 remark 1 3 let b 0 bp n and let x 0 xp y 1 yq rp q 1 0 p i 0 bixi 1 be a polytope then we have a homeomorphism x 1 xp y 1 yq rp q p i 1 bixi 1 where we can recover x 0 by x 0 b 1 0 1 p i 1 bixi under this homeomorphism the normalized lebesgue measure is given by b b 1 0 dx 1 dxp dy 1 dyq proof note that 1 x 1 xp y 1 yq is a r basis for m r as an abelian group where xi and yj denote projection to the xi and yj coordinates let 1 x 1 y q denote the dual basis then x 1 y q is a r basis for the m r and homz m z is a sub lattice of zx 1 zy q note that we can view homz m z as the kernel of the map z b 0 z given by 1 x 1 px p 1 y 1 qy q b 1 1 bp p b 0 z the image of is generated by b and the size of the image is b 0 b thus the index of homz m z in is b 0 b and thus b b 1 0 dx 1 dxp dy 1 dyq is the normalized lebesgue measure on 3 the hybrid space associated to a dual complex in this section we construct a hybrid space x b hyb associated to an snc model x of a log smooth pair x b this is a topological space over d such that the fiber over d is isomorphic to x and the central fiber is isomorphic to x b this construction exactly follows bj 17 section 2 2 where the construction for b 0 was done 3 1 local log function to construct the hybrid space we will first construct a log function on this space as done in bj 17 and glue x and x b using this log function to do this we first construct a local version of the log function for an open set u x and for local coordinates z w y on u where z z 0 zp w w 1 wq and y y 1 yr we say that u z w y is adapted to a stratum y locally e 0 ep b 1 bq if non archimedean degenerations of volume forms 7 the only irreducible components of d intersecting u are e 0 ep and b 1 bq u e 0 ep b 1 bq u y we have zi wj yk 1 on u and ei u zi 0 and bj u wj 0 in such a case we can define logu u d y let fu zb 00 z bp p then t u fu for some invertible holomorphic function u on u define logu z w y log z 0 log fu log zp log fu log w 1 log fu log wq log fu remark 3 1 1 bj 17 prop 2 1 if u z w y and u z w y are adapted to a stratum y then logu logu o 1 log t 1 as t 0 uniformly on compact subsets of u u 3 2 constructing the global log function here we globalize the log con struction by patching up the local log functions and to do so we will have to find a nice open covering of d the following construction as well as proposition 3 2 1 is similar to bj 17 proposition 2 1 but we provide some more details following cle 77 theorem 5 7 we can find tubular neighborhoods ui j of di j ei bj and a smooth projection i j ui j di j satisfying ui j ui j ui i j j in particular if ui j and ui j intersect thendi j di j 6 also note that ui j has as many connected components as di j and each connected component uy of ui j corresponds to a stratum y ei bj pick x x 0 suppose x lies in a stratum y around x pick an open neigh borhood ux that is adapted to y and lies in uy the union of all such ux for x x 0 covers x 0 since x 0 is compact we only need finitely many of these call these open sets u 1 ul and let their corresponding strata be y 1 yl respectively let 1 l be a partition of unity with respect to u 1 ul and let v l 1 u then v is a neighborhood of x 0 proposition 3 2 1 the function logv v d x b given by logv l 1 logu is well defined proof pick a point x v after a possible re indexing suppose x u 1 ua ua 1 ul then logv x 1 x logu 1 x a x logua x for this to make sense it is enough to find a face of x b such that y 1 ya note that u 1 ua uy 1 uyl each connected component of l 1 uy corresponds to a stratum of l 1 y let y be the stratum corresponding to the connected component of l 1 uy containing x then y contains y for all 1 l proposition 3 2 2 let u be an open set adapted to a stratum y then logv logu o 1 log t 1 locally uniformly as t 0 where the equality is interpreted as being true in some faces of x b containing y for all 1 l proof we may replace u by u uy and assume that u uy suppose x u 1 ua ua 1 ul then from the previous proof we know that there exists a stratum y such that x uy since x uy uy which tells us 8 sanal shivaprasad p 1 d 0 d d hyb 0 t d figure 2 the hybrid space p 1 d 0 d d hyb with the projection to d that y y 6 let z be the stratum corresponding to the connected component of uy uy containing x then y y z suppose x ei zi 0 defines ei in u and z i 0 defines ei in u 1 then log zi log fu log z i log fu 1 o 1 log t 1 in a neighborhood of x suppose x ei and z i 0 defines ei in u 1 then log z i log t o 1 log t 1 in a neighborhood of x using a similar argument for bj s as well gives us that logu logu 1 o 1 log t 1 in a neighborhood of x repeating the argument for all ui for i 1 a we get that logu logv o 1 log t in a neighborhood of x 3 3 the hybrid space the hybrid space of an snc model x of x b as a set is defined as x b hyb x b x b the topology on the hybrid space is defined by x b x b hyb is an open immersion the projection map x b hyb d given by extending the projection x b d and sending x b to the origin is continuous loghybv v x 0 b x b x b defined by logv on v x 0 b and identity on x b is continuous note that the hybrid space does not contain b it follows from proposition 3 2 2 that the topology of the hybrid space does not depend on the global log function we pick also note that the fiber of x b hyb d over t d is xt bt example 3 3 1 hybrid space of p 1 d the hybrid space x b hyb for example 2 2 1 is given by c d with the identification rei 1 0 rei 2 0 for all r r i 0 2 over any line segment in d with one end point 0 x b hyb is given by a solid cylinder see figure 2 the hybrid space x hyb constructed in bj 17 in the case b 0 is compact over a closed neighborhood of the origin but the hybrid space x b hyb that we construct is not always compact over a neighborhood of the origin as can be seen from example 3 3 1 however the following proposition tell us that it is not too bad in particular it implies that the hybrid space is locally compact non archimedean degenerations of volume forms 9 proposition 3 3 2 the map logv hyb v d x b x b is proper near the central fiber in the sense that for a compact set k x b log 1 v hyb k 1 1 2 d is a compact subset of x b hyb proof by rescaling the coordinate t we may without loss of generality assume that v x we need to show that l log 1 v hyb k 1 1 2 d is compact let i i ui be an open cover of l since k l is compact there exists a finite subset i i such that k i i ui for a point p x b x b hyb the sets of the form log 1 v hyb w 1 1 n d where w x b is an open neighborhood of p in x b and n n form basic open neighborhoods of p in x b hyb since k is compact there exists 0 r 1 such that log 1 v hyb k 1 rd i i ui since l 1 r 2 t 1 2 is a closed subset of the compact set 1 r 2 t 1 2 it is compact thus we can find a finite subset j i such that l 1 r 2 t 1 2 i j ui thus l i i j ui 4 convergence of measure in this section we prove theorem b by imitating the proof of bj 17 theorem a the proof idea is the same except for some new calculations since x b hyb is not compact we can no longer use stone weierstrass as done in bj 17 instead we use lemma 4 3 3 let x b be as in the previous section further assume that kx b q 0 and x b is sub log canonical i e j 1 for all j fix a proper snc model x of the pair x b note that we still don t need to assume that x is projective in this section as well 4 1 the subcomplex l of x b suppose l is a q line bundle on x that extends kx d b then l differs from k logx d b only by vertical divisors where k log x d kx x 0 x 0 red thus we can write l k logx d i aiei j jbj for some ai q see bj 17 section 3 1 let i aibi and min mini i since x is smooth the condition that x b is sub log canonical is equivalent to saying that j 1 for all j define the subcomplex l x b as follows if y ei bj then y l if i min for all i i and if j 1 for all j j in the case when dim xt 1 this just means that we pick the subgraph generated by vertices corresponding to irreducible components with minimal value and the rays corresponding to intersections ei bj with i mink k and j 1 define b y gcd bi i i and let y be the normalized lebesgue measure on y define d dim l 4 2 the residual measure given a section h 0 x ml and a closed sub variety y x 0 we can get a section resy h 0 y m l j y bj bj i y ei ei y if z 0 zp w 1 wq 0 define y locally and f dz 0 z 0 dzp zp dw 1 w 1 dwq wq m then resy f my then resy 2 m gives rise to a positive measure on y i y 6 bibi y we denote y i y 6 bibi y resy 2 m by just y resy 2 m 4 3 the convergence theorem let n 1 denote the dimension of x i e each of the fibers xt for t 6 0 has dimension n let h 0 x m kx d b be a generator and suppose there exists a section h 0 x ml that extends let 10 sanal shivaprasad t denote the restriction xt for t 6 0 if t dx 1 dxn m on a local chart then in 2 t t 1 m given locally by in 2 t t 1 m 2 mdx 1 dx 1 dxn dxn is a well defined positive smooth volume form on xt bt define a measure t in 2 t 2 min 2 log t 1 d t t 1 m on xt bt and a measure 0 face l dim d y resy 2 m b 1 on x b example 4 3 1 this example illustrates the importance of the sub log canonical assumption for simplicity assume that x has relative dimension 1 let e 0 be an irreducible component of x 0 and let b 0 be an irreducible component of b occurring with multiplicity 0 1 let r 0 be the face corresponding to e 0 b 0 let z and w denote the functions that define e 0 and b 0 in an open neighborhood u of e 0 b 0 such that z w 1 on u we may assume that t zb 0 we have logu u e 0 b 0 r 0 given by z w 7 log w log t suppose we had that logu t t weakly converged to a measure 0 on r 0 for some positive scaling function t by scaling by a suitable power of t we may assume that t i w 2 0 dw dw pick a compactly supported continuous function f on r 0 then ut f logu d t ut f log w log t i w 2 0 dw dw making a change of variable w t uei we get ut f logu d t 2 log t 1 0 f u t 2 0 1 udu if we pick a function f that is close to the indicator function of 0 n then t ut f logu d t o t log t 1 t 2 0 1 n log t 1 as t 0 if we require that this expression converge for all values of n as t 0 then it is easy to see that this is only possible if 0 is the zero measure and 1 t is growing super polynomially as t 0 thus we see that the convergence in this hybrid space setting is not very interesting if don t assume that x b is sub log canonical to prove theorem b we first prove a local version for functions that are pulled back from a face y via a local log map lemma 4 3 2 let u be a coordinate chart adapted to a stratum y of x 0 let f be a compactly supported continuous real valued function on u let cc u and if a maximal face of l is contained in y let y denote this unique maximal face and let y be the stratum associated to y if a maximal face of l is contained in then u xt f logu d t y resy 2 m y fb 1 y y non archimedean degenerations of volume forms 11 as t 0 if y does not contain a maximal face of l then the above limit is 0 proof by replacing l by l minx 0 and by t min we may assume that min 0 suppose y e 0 ep b 1 bq locally the proof for the case q 0 can be found in bj 17 lemma 3 5 and the calculations in this proof are not very different the only new estimate we need to make is equation 4 2 let z w y be coordinates on u such that ei zi 0 and bj wj 0 on u to simplify notation denote za za 00 z ap p and w w 1 1 w q q then we can write 1 m locally in u as 1 m za w dz 0 z 0 dzp zp dw 1 dwq dy we know that 1 m t dtt 1 m using dt t p i 0 bi dzi zi we can write 1 m t on

log polar coordinates let ui bi log zi log t and vj log wj log t u p i 0 iui v 1 q j 1 vj j 1 then we can write xt u fd t c log t 1 p q d p r q 0 y t 2 u v 1 log 1 t u v y t u v y dudv dy 2 where f logu t u v y is the haar measure on the torsor log 1 t u v y for the possibly disconnected lie group 0 p s 1 p 1 ei 0 ei p 1 s 1 q and c is a constant first let us try to figure out the order of magnitude of the expression on the left hand side after re indexing assume that 0 min p i 1 i note that t 2 u du o t 2 0 log t 1 i i 0 and for a fixed n such that supp f p i 0 biui 1 0 n q 4 2 0 n q t q j 1 2 j 2 vjdv o 1 log t 1 j j 1 thus we see that u xt f logu d t o t 2 0 log t 1 d p q i i 0 j j 1 note that the right hand side in the above expression goes off to 0 unless 0 0 and d i i 0 j j 1 this corresponds exactly to the case when there exists a face y y such that y l and y has dimension d 12 sanal shivaprasad after a possible re indexing assume that 0 p 0 and i 0 for all i p and 1 q 1 and j 1 for all j q and p q d then y e 1 ep b 1 bq in this case the poincar residue of at y is given by resy 1 m z ap 1 p 1 z ap p w 1 q 1 q 1 w 1 q q dzp 1 zp 1 dzp zp dwq 1 wq 1 dwq wq dy note that resy 2 m is a finite measure on y as ai 1 j 0 for all i p and j q using the expression of t in equation 4 1 we can write in 2 1 m t t 1 m 1 b 0 dz 1 z 1 dzp zp dw 1 w 1 dwq wq resy 1 m 2 make a change

of the previous lemma to obtain a global version lemma 4 3 3 let l be a compact subset of x b hyb then lim supt 0 xt l d t proof without loss of generality assume that v x since log 1 v hyb k 1 1 2 d k cpt x b forms a compact exhaustion of x 1 12 d we may as sume that l log 1 v hyb k for some compact k x b we wish to show that lim supt 0 xt 1 l logv d t let v i i ui and i i i be a partition of unity on ui i i such that logv i ilogui it is enough to show that lim supt 0 ui xt i 1 l logv d t for all i since logv logui o 1 log t 1 on the support of i we can find a compactly supported continuous function f on x b such that f logui 1 l logv on ui d supp i then lim sup t 0 ui xt i 1 l logv d t lim t 0 ui xt i f logui d t and the right hand side exists and is finite by lemma 4 3 2 we now prove the statement of theorem b for functions that are pulled back from compactly supported continuous functions on x b via a global log map lemma 4 3 4 let f be a continuous compactly supported function on x b and let v be a neighborhood of x 0 and let logv be a global log function then xt f logv d t x b fd 0 as t 0 proof let v i i ui and let i be a partition of unity on ui so that logv i

ui contains at most one maximal face of l and this happens if and only if y intersects ui thus for all i i we have 4 4 lim t 0 ui xt i f logui d t l dim d y i resy 2 m b 1 combining equations 4 3 and 4 4 we are done now we are ready to prove theorem b 14 sanal shivaprasad proof of theorem b let f be a continuous compactly supported function on x b hyb fix a global log function logv and let be a continuous function that is 1 in a neigh borhood of x 0 and is supported in 1 1 2 d by replacing f by f x b logv f we may assume that f x b 0 letk supp f and pick 0 since f is continuous and compactly

of example 3 3 1 let t denote the haar measure on p 1 0 t then 1 2 log t 1 t weakly converges to the lebesgue measure on r x b as mea sures on the hybrid space x b hyb more generally we can prove a similar result for toric varieties example 4 3 6 convergence for a torus let n be a free abelian group of rank n let m homz n z and t spec c m be the associated torus let y be a smooth projective toric compactification of t i e a smooth projective toric variety associated to a regular fan in nr for example y p n let be a torus invariant meromorphic 1 form on y note that there is a canonical choice of such an up to a sign and has poles of order one along all boundary divisors let d be the reduced divisor given by the sum of the boundary divisors then h 0 ky d consider the constant family y d over d then y d d d is log smooth and consider the projective snc model y y d of y d d d then x b is canonically isomorphic to nr with the faces given by the cones in the fan defining y thus we have a hybrid space given by y d d hyb t d nr we also get a top dimensional meromorphic form on y d whose restriction to each fiber gives the measure let t denote the measure induced by on the fiber t t scaled by a factor of 1 2 log t 1 n applying theorem b to this setting we get that the the measures t converge to the lebesgue measure on each of the cones the lebesgue measures on each of the cones is exactly the lebesgue measure on nr normalized by n restricted to that cone thus t converges weakly to the lebesgue measure on nr as t 0 5 convergence on the limit hybrid model the choice of a hybrid space x b hyb depends on the choice of the model x of x we construct a canonical hybrid space x b hyb that does not depend on a choice of a model such a space is obtained by an inverse limit x b hyb lim x x b hyb theorem 5 1 1 implies that this definition matches with the def inition in the introduction when x d is a projective and meromorphic over d we also explain how the space x b hyb can itself be viewed as an analytic space when x d is projective and meromorphic over d 5 1 the limit hybrid model given two models x x of x b there is al ways a bimeromorphic map x 99 k x induced by the given isomorphism with x over d we say that x dominates x when this bimeromorphic map extends to a morphism more precisely we say that x dominates x if we have a proper holomorphic map x x which commutes with the projection to d and extends the identity map x x non archimedean degenerations of volume forms 15 when x and x are proper snc models of x b such that x dominates x via a map x x we also have an integral affine map x b x b and also a continuous surjective map x b hyb x b hyb as in section 4 2 and section 4 8 of bj 17 if y is a face of x b associated to a stratum y of x 0 by identifying the smallest stratum y that contains y then y y we describe these maps in detail in the projective case in the following subsection the collection of all proper snc models of x b is a directed system see bj 17 lemma 4 1 for more details we can then define x b hyb lim x x b hyb it is easy to see that we have a projection map x b hyb d such that 1 d x b and the central fiber x b hyb 0 is lim x x b where the inverse limit runs over all proper snc models x of x b and the inverse limit is taken in the category of topological spaces theorem 5 1 1 tells us why this definition of x b hyb matches with the one in the introduction suppose now that x b is projective over d i e we can view x as a closed subset of pn d for some n such that x and b are cut out by polynomials whose coefficients are holomorphic on d and meromorphic on d thus we can view the coefficients of the defining equations as elements of c t using the same defining equations in pn c t we get varieties xc t and bc t over spec c t a smooth projective snc model x of x b gives rise to an snc model xc t over spec c t whose generic fiber is xc t and special fiber is x 0 and x 0 bc t is an snc divisor in xc t then we can define xc t bc t as the dual complex of the divisor xc t 0 bc t and we have that xc t bc t x b the following theorem analogous to ks 06 theorem 10 bfj 16 cor 3 2 re alizes the central fiber x b hyb 0 as a non archimedean space theorem 5 1 1 we have an isomorphism xan c t ban c t lim x x b where an denotes the berkovich analytification with respect to the t adic norm on c t and the inverse limit is taken over all smooth projective snc models x b of x b we will prove the above theorem in the following section after setting up some preliminaries 5 2 the central fiber of the limit hybrid model as a non archimedean space for the remainder of this subsection we assume that x is a smooth proper variety over the discretely valued field k c t b x is a snc divisor and x is a smooth proper integral scheme over r c t along with a specified isomorphism xk x such that x is an snc model of x b that is x 0 b is a snc divisor in x then x b is the dual intersection complex of the divisor x 0 b we also have a cw complex x x 0 which can be viewed as a subcomplex of x b let xan and ban denote the berkovich analytification of x and b respectively with respect to the t adic norm on k we have an inclusion ix x xan and a retraction rx xan x as constructed in mn 15 we would like to do a similar construction for x b and xan ban let x be a proper snc model of x b then we have an inclusion map i x b x b xan ban which is given as follows let y locally e 0 ep b 1 bq denote a stratum of x 0 pick a point r 0 rp s 1 sq y let zi and wj locally define ei and bj near y for 0 i p and 1 j q then 16 sanal shivaprasad we have an isomorphism o x 0 y c z 0 zp w 1 wq pulling back the valuation defined by np 1 nq c z w minc 6 0 r s we get an element of xan ban it is clear that i x b is injective and it follows from mn 15 prop 3 1 4 that i x b is continuous the image of i x b is denoted as sk x b we also have a continuous retraction map r x b x an ban x b which is a left inverse to the map i x b defined as follows since x is proper every valuation in xan ban has a center in x 0 pick x xan ban pick the smallest stratum y locally e 0 ep b 1 bq containing redx x then we define r x b x x e 0 x ep x b 1 x bq in y to see why r x b is continuous recall that the map x an x 0 taking any valuation to its center is anti continuous i e the inverse image of a closed set is open for any stratum y locally e 0 ep b 1 bq of x 0 the subset r 1 x b y xan ban is a closed set as it corresponds to a subset of xan whose center lies on an open set of x 0 therefore it is enough to prove that r x b r 1 x b y r 1 x b y y is continuous for all possible strata y but this is clear from the description of the map above we also have a continuous retraction map x x b x which we obtain from the composition x b i x b xan ban xan rx x more explicitly if y locally e 0 ep b 1 bq let y locally e 0 ep containing y then x y y and x r 0 rp s 1 sq r 0 rp if x and x are two proper snc models of x b such that x dominates x then there is a surjective map rx x b x b x b given by x b i x b xan ban r x b x b the surjectivity of the map follows from mn 15 prop 3 17 we have an explicit description of rx x b similar to bj 17 section 4 2 as follows let x x denote the proper map between x and x let y e 0 e p b 1 bq be a stratum of x 0 and let y e 0 ep b 1 bq be the stratum of x 0 containing the image of y note that q q let ei bj be locally defined by z i 0 and w j 0 near y and let ei and bj be locally defined by zi 0 and wj 0 near y then we can write zi ui p k 0 z k ci k and wj vj w j p k 0 z k dj k for units ui vj ox y and for some ci k dj k n then rx x b y y and is given by ri p k 0 ci kr k and sj s j p k 0 dj kr j non archimedean degenerations of volume forms 17 it follows from the explicit description of rx x b that 5 1 log x rx x b logx o 1 log t uniformly on compacts in a neighborhood of x 0 as t 0 proposition 5 2 1 we have a commutative diagram x b x x b x x r x x b rx x x which gives rise to a continuous map lim x x b lim x x proof to see that the diagram commutes it enough to use the fact that rx x rx rx mn 15 prop 3 1 7 and show that x r x b rx on xan ban pick xan ban let y locally e 0 ep b 1 bq be the minimal stratum of x 0 b containing the center of then r x b e 0 ep b 1 bq in y let y locally e 0 ep be the stratum containing y then y is the minimal stratum in x 0 containing the center of and rx e 0 ep in y it follows from the description of x that x r x b rx proposition 5 2 2 if x is a blowup of x along a stratum y e 0 ep b 1 bq then rx x b x b x b is a homeomorphism obtained by a subdivision proof this follows from a local blowup computation let e denote the exceptional divisor in x then the strata of x that map down to y are of the form e e i b 0 b q and e e 0 e p b j where i and j denote subsets of 0 p and 1 q of size p and q 1 respectively and e i and b j denote the strict transforms of ei and bj first let s compute the image of e in x b note that divx t i bie i p i 0 bi e let e denote the divisorial valuation corresponding to e then e ei e e i e e e 1 orde t 1 p i 0 bi for all i 0 p similarly e bj 1 p i 0 bi for all j 1 q thus the image of e in x b is 1 p i 0 bi 1 1 it is easy to check that the x b x b is a subdivision obtained by adding the vertex e for example let s compute the image of y for y e e 1 e p b 1 b q note that y x 0 xp y 1 yq p i 0 bi x 0 p i 1 bixi 1 18 sanal shivaprasad a b figure 3 the dual complexes of the p 1 d 0 d d after a blowing up at 0 0 and b blowing up at 1 0 suppose is a valuation represented by x 0 xp y 1 yq y then e 0 e 0 e e x 0 and ei e i e xi x 0 for i 1 p similarly bj yj x 0 for j 1 q thus we see that rx x b y is given by x 0 xp y 1 yq 7 x 0 x 1 x 0 xp x 0 y 1 x 0 yq x 0 in general the map x x is not a homeomorphism as illustrated by the following example example 5 2 3 blowup of p 1 d let the notation be the same as in example 2 2 1 let e 0 p 1 0 b 1 0 d b 2 d let x denote the blowup of x at e 0 b 1 and let x denote the blowup of x at some point in e 0 that is different from 0 and then x b is obtained from x b by adding a vertex along the ray e 0 b 1 and x b is obtained from x b by adding an extra vertex and joining it to e 0 the retraction rx x b x b x b is an isomorphism while rx x b x b x b is given by collapsing the newly added edge and vertex to e 0 lemma 5 2 4 let x be a proper snc model of x b and let k x b be a compact set then there exists a proper snc model x of x b dominating x such that r 1 x x b k x proof for a valuation xan and a divisor d x not contained in ker set d f where f defines d in an open neighborhood of the redx since it is enough to prove the result for some neighborhood of all points ink we may assume without loss of generality that there exists an irreducible component e of x 0 and an 0 such that e for all k let b 1 bq be the irreducible components of b containing the centers of all k it is enough to show that there exists a smooth proper snc model x of x b such that redx is not contained in the closures of b 1 bq in x for all x b such that rx x b k note that if q 0 we are done we will prove the result by induction on q pick n 0 large enough so that n e 1 b 1 for all k let ie and ib 1 be the ideal sheaf defining e and b 1 respectively let x be the blowup of x along the ideal sheaf ine ib 1 then x is a proper model of x b although it may not necessarily be smooth pick k and let u be an affine open neighborhood of redx if e is defined by z 0 and b 1 is defined by w 1 0 on u then u spec ox u z n w 1 is a chart of the blowup let x be a resolution of singularities of x such that x is a proper snc model for x b non archimedean degenerations of volume forms 19 pick x b such that rx x b then z n w 1 z n w 1 0 thus the center of in x is contained in u but since u misses the strict transform of b 1 and thus the center of in x is not contained in b 1 thus the irreducible components of b containing the centers of any valuations r 1 x x b k can only be b 2 bq and thus we are done by induction corollary 5 2 5 let x x lim x x b given a smooth proper snc model x of x b there exists a smooth proper snc model x of x b dominating x b such that the center of x in x does not intersect b proof this easily follows lemma 5 2 4 once we find a model x of x such that redx x is not contained in the closure of b we can further blowup to assume that the two become disjoint proposition 5 2 6 the map lim x x b lim x x is open and injective where x ranges over all proper snc models x of x b proof pick x x x x be two distinct elements in lim x x b let x be a proper snc model of x b such that x 6 x in x b from corollary 5 2 5 we can find a model x b such that x x x and x x x note that x 6 x as rx x b x 6 rx x b x thus is injective to see that is open it is enough to show that x x lim x x b y u is open for a model y of x b and an open set u y b we may also assume that u has compact closure using lemma 5 2 5 we can find a model y such that u r 1 y y b u y then it is easy to check that x x lim x x b y u x x lim x x y u to prove theorem 5 1 1 we exploit the isomorphism xan lim x x see ks 06 theorem 10 bfj 16 cor 3 2 remark 5 2 7 the homeomorphism xan lim x x in ks 06 theorem 10 is stated when the inverse limit runs over all smooth proper models x of x such that the central fiber x 0 is an snc divisor however we may as well take the inverse limit over all smooth proper models x such that x 0 b is an snc divisor because such models form a cofinal system proof of theorem 5 1 1 we obtain a map r xan ban lim x x b by con sidering the inverse limit over the retraction map r x b x an ban x b observe that we have the commutative diagram where the bottom map is a homeomorphism xan ban lim x x b xan lim x x r x b i rx 20 sanal shivaprasad therefore it is enough to show that the image of ban in lim x x does not intersect with the image of let x x be an element of lim x x b and let r 1 x x x without loss of generality assume to the contrary that ban 1 using corollary 5 2 5 we can find a model x such that the center of x in x does not intersect b then x x x we also have that rx x x x and the center of in x is contained in the center of x in x but the center of is contained in the closure of b 1 which is a contradiction 5 3 the limit hybrid space as an analytic space in this section for any 0 r 1 we realize x b hybr x b hyb rd as the analytification of a scheme over a banach ring ar as in ber 09 consider the banach ring ar i z cit i ci c and i z ci hybri where ci hyb max ci 1 if ci 6 0 and 0 hyb 0 then its berkovich spectrum m ar is homeomorphic to rd for more details see ber 09 bj 17 appendix 1 note that any function that is holomorphic in open neighborhood of rd 0 and meromorphic at 0 gives an element of ar given a projective family x d we can think of x as a finite scheme over spec ar because the coefficients of the homogeneous equations cutting out x in pn d can be viewed as elements of ar we denote this scheme as xar similarly we get bar xar let an denote the berkovich analytification functor on the category of finite type schemes over spec ar the map xar bar spec ar gives rise to the canonical map xanar b an ar m ar rd the following proposition tells us how this analytic space is related to x b hyb proposition 5 3 1 we have a homeomorphism xanar b an ar x b hybr as spaces over rd proof let r xar bar rd m ar be the canonical projection map from bj 17 lemma a 6 we have the following homeomorphisms 1 r rd x b rd and 1 r 0 xanc t banc t moreover the first homeomorphism is compatible with the projections to rd the above homeomorphisms let us define a bijection xanar b an ar x b hybr it remains to check that this map is continuous to do this first note that we have an embedding x b hyb xhyb where xhyb lim x x hyb given by the canonical inclusion over d and by proposition 5 2 1 over the central fiber we also have a homeomorphism xanar x hyb r as topological spaces over rd bj 17 prop 4 12 it is straightforward to check that the following diagram of topological spaces over rd commutes xanar b an ar x b hybr xanar x hyb r since the map at the bottom is a homeomorphism and the top map is a bijection the top map is also a homeomorphism non archimedean degenerations of volume forms 21 now we can define the hybrid space associated to a not necessarily smooth pair x b over d as x b hyb xanar b an ar proposition 5 3 1 tells us that this matches with the previous definition 5 4 convergence on limit hybrid model the convergence described in theo rem b depends on the choice of a model x b of x b we would like to remedy this by describing the convergence on x b hyb which does not require choosing a model given two models x b and x b of x b with x b dominating x b via x x a line bundle l on x extending kx d b a generating section extending and a proper we can get a line bundle l l on x extending kx d b and a section extending applying theorem b to both x and x we get measures x 0 and x 0 on x b and x b respectively it follows from lemma 4 3 2 and equation 5 1 that x 0 is just the push forward of the measure x 0 under the map rx x b thus we get a compatible system of measure x 0 on all models x b domi nating a fixed model x b this gives rise to a measure on 0 on x b hyb 0 and thus we get the following convergence theorem theorem 5 4 1 let x b be a log smooth pair over d such that kx d b q 0 and let h 0 x m kx d b have an analytic singularity at t 0 i e there exists a model x of x b a line bundle l extending kx d b and h 0 x ml extending then there exists min q and d n such that the measure t i t t t 2 min 2 log t 1 d converges weakly to a measure 0 on x b hyb moreover if we fix a model x a line bundle l and a section h 0 x ml extending then 0 is supported on l x b xan ban and d min and 0 has the same description as in section 4 3 example 5 4 2 following up example 4 3 5 we see that the haar measures on p 1 converges to the lebesgue measure on r which can be thought of as the unique line joining the type 1 points corresponding 0 and in p 1 c t an more gener ally we could take bt is given by p t q t for distinct functions p q which are meromorphic on d and holomorphic on d then there exists an isomorphism of pairs p 1 d p t q t p 1 d 0 d d this extends to an isomorphism p 1 c t an p q p 1 c t an 0 where p q denote the type 1 points corresponding to p t and q t thus as t 0 the haar measure on p 1 p t q t converges to the lebesgue measure on the unique line joining the points p and q in p 1 c t an p q example 5 4 3 generalizing the above example let x p 1 d denote the constant family let b z 2 a 1 z a 2 0 p 1 d where z denotes the coordinate on p 1 and a 1 a 2 are functions that are meromorphic on d and holo morphic on d then x b is log calabi yau also assume that the polynomial z 2 a 1 z a 2 c t z is irreducible fix a square root u t and consider the field extension c t c u this corresponds to a degree two map d d given by u u 2 let y denote the fiber product of x d d the polynomial z 2 a 1 z a 2 c t z splits into factors z p z q in c u z by the previous example as u 0 the haar measure on p 1 p u q u converges to the lebesgue measure on the line joining p and q 22 sanal shivaprasad in p 1 c u an p q call this measure 0 we have a map p 1 c u an p q p 1 c t an ban to understand the convergence of the haar measure on p 1 bt note that p 1 bt p 1 p u q u thus as t 0 the haar measure on p 1 bt converges to the pushforward of 0 to p 1 c t an ban example 5 4 4 following up on 4 3 6 we get that the scaled haar measure on the constant family of tori t n c converges to the lebesgue measure on rn for any smooth projective toric compactification y of t with boundary divisor d the image of y d t an c t coincides with the image of nr t anc t given by sending ni ai nr to the seminorm j aj m j maxj aj e i ri mj ni 5 5 convergence for log canonical pairs x b in this subsection we drop the assumption thatx is smooth and prove theorem a suppose thatx is a normal projective family of analytic varieties over d and b is q divisor in x such that x b is a sub log canonical log calabi yau pair with analytical singularities at 0 let h 0 x m kx d b be a generating section let y b x b be a log resolution of singularities here b b e where e is the exceptional divisor of note that ky d b kx d b q 0 therefore the pair y b is log smooth sub log canonical and log calabi yau let h 0 y m ky d b denote the section applying theorem b to y we get that there exist min q d n such the measures t in 2 t t 2 log t 1 d t 2 min converge weakly to a measure 0 on the space y b hybr for any 0 r 1 let anar y b r x b r denote the continuous map induced by on the analytification then it follows from a change of variable formula that t anar t in 2 t t 2 log t 1 d t 2 min from the continuity of anar it follows that t anar 0 which finishes the proof of theorem a references bat 94 victor v batyrev dual
