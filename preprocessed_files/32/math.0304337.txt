recent results related to group actions in several complex variables we ll not aim at giving a complete survey about the topic but giving some our own results and related ones we ll divide the results into two cases compact and noncompact trans formation groups we emphasize some essential differences between the two cases in the compact case we ll mention some results about schlichtness of envelopes of holomorphy and compactness of automorphism groups of some invariant domains in the noncompact case we ll present our solution of the longstanding problem the so called extended future tube conjecture which asserts that the extended future tube is a domain of holomorphy invariant version of cartan s lemma about extension of holomorphic functions from the subvarities in the sense of group actions will be also mentioned 2000 mathematics subject classification 32 key words and phrases domain of holomorphy plurisubharmonic func tion group actions 1 fundamentals of several complex variables about one century ago hartogs discovered that there exist some domains in several complex variables on which any holomorphic functions can be extended to larger domains being different with one complex variable this causes a basic concept domain of holomorphy definition a domain of holomorphy in cn is a domain on which there exists a holomorphic function which can t be extended holomorphically across any boundary points a domain in cn is called holomorphically convex if given any infinite discrete point sequence zk there exists a holomorphic function f s t f zk is unbounded or f xv consequently there exists a holomorphic function which tends to institute of mathematics amss chinese academy of sciences beijing department of math ematics zhejiang university hangzhou china

stein i e holomorphically convex definition a function with value in on the domain d in cn is called plurisubharmonic p s h if i is upper semicontinuous i e c is open for each c r or equivalently limz z 0 z z 0 for z 0 d ii for each complex line l z 0 tr z 0 d l d is subharmonic w r t one complex variable t an equivalent definition in the sense of distributions is that i is a positive current in particular when is c 2 this means levi form 2 zi zj 0 every where in other words djd 0 where j is the complex structure if i 0 then is called strictly p s h example for a bounded domain or a domain biholomorphic to a bounded domain the bergman kernel k z z is strictly p s h a pseudoconvex domain in cn is a domain on which there exists a p s h function which tends to at the boundary it s easy to see that a holomorphical convex domain is pseudoconvex since f 2 is plurisubharmonic function where f is given in the consequence of the definition of a stein domain a deep characterization of a domain of holomorphy is given by a solution to levi problem which is the converse of the above statement fact a domain d in cn is a domain of holomorphy if and only if the domain is pseudoconvex a natural corresponding concept of the domain of holomorphy in the setting of complex manifolds complex spaces is the so called stein manifold stein space which is defined as a holomorphically convex and holomorphically separable complex manifold space a complex manifold or space with finite embedding dimension is stein if and only if it is a closed complex submanifold or subvariety in some cn and if and only if there exists a strictly p s h exhaustion function which is r valued i e the value is not allowed a complex reductive lie group in particular a complex semisimple lie group is a stein manifold we know that a domain of holomorphy or a stein manifold are defined by special holomorphic functions which are usually hard to construct in several complex variables however a pseudoconvex domain is defined by a special p s h function which is a real function and then relatively easy to construct construction of various holomorphic objects in several complex variables and complex geometry is a fundamental and difficult problem an important philosophy here is reducing the construction of holomorphic functions to the construction of plurisubharmonic functions because of the solution of levi problem and ho rmander s l 2 estimates for and other results 2 group actions in several complex variables definition a group action of the group g on a set x is given by a mapping g x x satisfying the following 1 e x x 2 ab x a b x where e is the identity of the group a b g x x a x a x some results related to group actions in several complex variables 745 a group action on a set can be restricted on various cases when the set is a topological space and the group is a topological group the action is continuous then one gets a topological transformation group when the space is a metric space the transformation preserves the metric then one gets a motion group when the set is a differentiable manifold and the group is a lie group the action is differen tiable then one gets a lie transformation group when the set is a vector space the transformation preserves the vector space structure then one gets a linear trans formation group when the set is an algebraic variety or a scheme the group is an algebraic group and the action is algebraic one gets an algebraic transformation group when the set is a complex space the transformation is holomorphic and the action is real analytic then one gets a real holomorphic transformation group note that in this case if the action is continuous then it is also real analytic if the set is a complex space the group is a complex lie group and the the action is holomorphic then one gets a complex holomorphic transformation group in this talk we re mainly concerned with the last case we consider a complex lie group gc with a real form gr acting holomorphically on a complex manifold also called holomorphic gc manifold and a gr invariant domain it s known that a complex reductive lie group has a unique maximal compact subgroup up to conjugate as its real form but it also has many noncompact real forms a group action on a set can be regarded as a representation of the group on the whole group of transformations an effective group action means the representation is faithful so it corresponds to a closed subgroup of the whole transformation group actually many domains in several complex variables such as hartogs circular reinhardt and tube domains can be formulated in the setting of group actions examples a hartogs and circular domains consider the hartogs action of c with the real form s 1 on cn c cn cn given by t z 1 zn tz 1 z 2 zn then hartogs domain is s 1 invariant domain consider the circular action of c with the real form s 1 on cn c cn cn given by t z 1 zn tz 1 tz 2 tzn then circular domain is s 1 invariant domain b reinhardt domains consider the reinhardt action of c n on cn given by t 1 tn z 1 zn t 1 z 1 tnzn then reinhardt domain is s 1 n invariant domain one can similarly defines matrix reinhardt domains c tube domains consider the action of rn on cn given by r z r z then r n invariant domain is tube domain d future tube let m 4 be the minkowski space with the lorentz metric x y x 0 y 0 x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 x 3 y 3 where x x 0 x 1 x 2 x 3 y y 0 y 1 y 2 y 3 r 4 let v and v v be the future and past light cones in r 4 respectively i e v y m y 2 0 y 0 0 the corresponding tube domains t v r 4 iv in c 4 are called future and past tubes let l be the lorentz group i e l o 1 3 l has four connected components denote the identity component of l by l which is called the restricted lorentz group i e l so 1 3 let l c be the complex lorentz group i e l o 1 3 c o 4 c l c has two 746 xiangyu zhou connected components denote the identity component of l c by l c called the proper complex lorentz group which has the restricted lorentz group as its real form considering the linear action of l c on c 4 the future or past tube is l invariant denote the n point future tube by n n times let l c act diagonally on c 4 n i e for z z 1 z n c 4 n z z 1 z n where l c then n is l invariant e matrix reinhardt domains let cn m m z 1 zn zj c m m be the space of n tuples of m m matrices a domain d cn m m is called matrix reinhardt if it is invariant under the diagonal u m u m action u v z 1 zn 7 uz 1 v uznv these domains are the usual reinhardt domains in the case m 1 diag d is defined as the intersection of d with the diagonal matrices z 1 zn c n m m slice theory when g is a lie transformation group properly acting on a smooth manifold x e g when g is compact one has a satisfactory slice theory about the structure of a neighborhood of an orbit this theory was extended to the case of an affine reductive group action regularly on an affine variety by d luna 20 and the case of a complex reductive lie group g action holomorphically on a stein space x by snow 27 in these cases the structure of a neighborhood of a closed orbit is finely determined we state the result for reduced stein spaces let g x be a closed orbit then there exists a locally closed gx invariant stein subspace b containing x s t the natural map from the homogeneous fiber bundle g gx b over g gx g x is biholomorphic onto a saturated open stein subset of x where x x g is the categorical quotient or git quotient which exists as a stein space here b is called a slice at x the slice b is transversal to the closed orbit g x when x is regular at x then b can be chosen to be regular as a consequence of the slice theorem one has a stratification of the categorical quotient x g at least when x is a stein manifold the stratum with maximal dimension is zariski open in x g and is contained in the regular part of x g this is called principal stratum the inverse of the principal stratum under x x g consists of all g closed orbits satisfying that they are of maximal dimension k among the dimensions of all g closed orbits and their corresponding isotropy groups are of minimum number of components such orbits are called principal closed orbits and the corresponding isotropy groups are called principal when k dimg then x is called having fpig 3 some results on compact holomorphic transfor mation groups the relationship between orbit connectedness orbit convexity and holomor phical convexity goes back to the beginning of this century when several complex variables was born due to hartogs reinhardt h cartan and others one already knew some classical relations between completeness logarithmic convexity and holo some results related to group actions in several complex variables 747 morphical convexity for circular domains hartogs domains and reinhardt domains the orbit connectedness and orbit convexity are defined in a general setting for arbitrary compact connected lie group which correspond to completeness and logarithmic convexity when one restricts to the above domains there are some fundamental relationships between orbit connectedness and orbit convexity with holomorphically convexity and envelope of holomorphy for invariant domains definition let gc be a connected complex lie group gr be a connected closed real form of gc let x be a holomorphic gc space d x be a gr invariant set we call d orbit connected if for bz gc x g 7 g z b 1 z d is connected for each z d when gc gr is a geodesic convex pair i e the map lie gr gr v g exp iv g gc is a homeomorphism cf 3 d is called orbit convex if for each z d and v ilie gr s t exp v b 1 z d it follows exp tv b 1 z d for all t 0 1 roughly speaking orbit connectedness means that gcx d is connected for every x d one has known for a long time that the envelope of holomorphy of a domain in cn or more general a riemann domain over cn exists uniquely as a riemann domain over cn there is a difficult problem of univalence when is the envelope of holomorphy of a domain in cn itself a domain in cn we have the following criteria for the univalence of the envelope of holomorphy for certain invariant domains theorem 1 36 let x be a stein manifold kc be a complex reductive lie group holomorphically acting on x where k is a connected compact lie group and kc be its universal complexification let d x be a k invariant orbit connected domain then the envelope of holomorphy e d of d is schlicht and orbit convex if and only if the envelope of holomorphy e kc d of kc d is schlicht furthermore in this case e kc d kc e d when k s 1 and the action is circular or circular and hartogs the corresponding concepts of orbit connectedness for such domains were introduced separately and the above results were obtained and stated separately by casadio tarabushi and trapani in 1 2 when k s 1 n and the action is reinhardt the result is well known as a classical result about reinhardt domain which asserts that any reinhardt domain in c n has schlicht envelope of holomorphy some other results were also included in the above theorem so our result can also be regarded as an extension of their results and the classical result on reinhardt domains in a unified way in the proof a theorem due to harish chandra on the infinite dimensional representation of lie groups plays an important role we also give some examples of orbit connected domains let x kc lc the action of kc on x be given by the left translations when l is connected or k l is a symmetric pair then any k invariant domain is orbit connected the simplest example is reinhardt domains in c n the origin of orbit connectedness could at least go back to 28 example a theorem of v bargmann d hall and a s wightman cf 748 xiangyu zhou wightman 32 jost 12 streater wightman 28 asserts that n is orbit con nected we also consider the homogeneous embeddings of kc lc let x be a smooth homogeneous space embedding of kc lc d x be a k domain assume that l is connected or k l is a symmetric pair then e d is schlicht and orbit convex in particular every matrix reinhardt domain of holomorphy d is orbit convex since an orbit convex matrix reinhardt domain has a path connected diag d so a matrix reinhardt domain of holomorphy has a connected diag d theorem 2 37 let k be a connected compact lie group l be a closed not necessarily connected subgroup of k let kc and lc be respectively universal complexification of k and l suppose that d is k invariant relatively compact domain in kc lc here the action of kc is given by left translations then i aut d is a compact lie group ii any proper holomorphic self mapping of d is biholomorphic if k is semisimple or a direct product of a semisimple compact lie group and a compact torus by a result of matsushima kc lc is a stein manifold which is a holomorphic kc manifold w r t left translation action the motivations of the present work are two folds the result i is to extend a main result of 4 where the same result was obtained by requiring a restrictive con dition that k l is a symmetric pair i e k l is a compact riemannian symmetric space the result ii is to extend a classical result which asserts that proper self mapping of the relatively compact reinhardt domains in c n is biholomorphic the proof is involved with many famous results such as mostow decomposi tion theorem h cartan s theorem about compactness of automorphism groups andreotti frankel s theorem on homology group of a stein manifold the holomor phic version of de rham s theorem on a stein manifold a result of milnor s about cw complex a result from iteration theory poincare duality theorem degree the ory for proper mappings covering lifting existence theorem and a result about compact semisimple lie groups et al 4 extended future tube conjecture let s keep the notation in example d of the section 2 the set n z z n l c is called the extended future tube the extended future tube conjecture which arose naturally from axiomatic quantum field theory at the end of 1950 s asserts that the extended future tube n is a domain of holomorphy for n 3 this conjecture turns out to be very beautiful and natural in their papers vladimirov and sergeev said that the importance of the conjecture is also due to the fact that there are some assertions in qft such as the finite covariance theorem of bogoliubov vladimirov proved only assuming that this conjecture is true according to the axiomatic quantum field theory cf 12 13 28 one may describe physical properties of a quantum system using the wightman functions which correspond to holomorphic functions in n invariant w r t the diagonal action of l this sort of functions have the following extension property some results related to group actions in several complex variables 749 bhw theorem due to bargman hall andwightman 1957 an l invariant holomorphic function on n can be extended to an l c invariant holomorphic function on n cf 12 13 28 in the proof the orbit connectedness of n play a key role with this and identity theorem one can easily define the invariant holomorphic extension so a natural question arises i e can these holomorphic functions be extended further or is n holomorphic convex w r t l c invariant holomorphic func tion after some argument this is equivalent to ask if n is a domain of holomorphy streater s theorem a holomorphic function on the dyson domain n n j where j n m 4 n is the set of jost points which was proved to exist and characterized by r jost can be extended to a holomorphic function on n cf 12 28 so a natural question is to construct the envelope of holomorphy of the dyson domain n n j this question is mentioned in the article quantum field theory of the russian s great dictionary encyclopedia of mathematics that the extended future tube conjecture holds is equivalent to that this envelope of holomorphy is exactly the extended future tube n the conjecture have been mentioned as an open problem in many classical 12 28 and recent references 11 21 24 28 31 and references therein in 38 39 we found a route to solve the conjecture via kiselman loeb s minimum principle and luna s slice theory let s recall the minimum principle minimum principle let x be a complex manifold gc a connected complex lie group gr a connected closed real form of gc denote gc gc gr and p x gc x the natural projections gc acts on x gc on the right by x gc gc x gc x g h 7 x gh let x gc be a right gr invariant domain and have connected fibres of p and u c be a right gr invariant function u naturally induces a smooth function u x g on idx suppose that 1 u is p s h on 2 x p u x is strictly p s h on x p 1 x and 3 u x is exhaustive on x x then the minimum principle asserts that v x inf g x u x g is c and p s h on p remark c o kiselman in 14 first obtained the minimum principle when x cn gc c m gr imc m j j loeb in 18 generalized kiselman s result to the present general case it s easy to construct invariant p s h functions w r t compact lie group via averaging technique however such a technique doesn t hold again for non compact lie group observation let g be a real lie group which acts on cn linearly let d be a bergman hyperbolic domain which is g invariant then the bergman kernel kd z w satisfies kd z z kd g z g z for g g when g is compact when g is semisimple we have kd z w kd g z g w 750 xiangyu zhou brief proof is as follows since g linearly act on cn one has a representation g gl n c if g is semisimple then the image of g must be in sl n c if g is compact the image of g is in u n using the transformation formula for the bergman kernels and noting that the determinant of the jacobian of the map z g z is 1 for semisimple case and is in s 1 for compact case then we can get the result we consider the following question let x be a stein manifold gc be a connected complex reductive lie group acting on x s t the action is holomorphic gr a connected real form of gc let d x be a gr invariant orbit connected stein domain is gc d also stein when gr is compact the answer is positive cf 22 this is a special case of theorem 1 in the section 3 the extended future tube conjecture is a special case of the question where x c 4 n gc l c gr l d n gc d n consider x gc x x g g 1 x suppose that there is a suitable gr invariant s p s h function on d we have a p s h function u x g g 1 x on 1 d define x inf g x u x g for x p where p x gc x is given by p x g x and x g gc x g in order to prove x is p s h on p gc d we can use the minimum principle due to kiselman loeb observation x is connected if and only if d is orbit connected in order to use the minimum principle we still need to check two assumptions i u x is s p s h on x ii u x is exhaustion on x where u x g is defined on id x gc gr and is induced by u gc gc gr x x usually speaking assumption i fails on the whole however when x has fpig then the assumption i is fulfilled on a zariski open subset of let x x x gcx is closed gc x is principal and finite then by the slice theory a x a is a gc invariant analytic subset of x let d d x 1 d then the assumption i is satisfied on if the assumption ii is also satisfied on then we can use the minimum principle on and get that x is p s h on p gc d a since x is upper semicontinuous on gc d by the extension theorem for p s h functions x can be extended to a p s h function on gc d if we can prove that the extended p s h function is weak exhaustion then gc d is stein as a consequence of our observations we deduce that the general question is true for pseudoconvex pair gc gr i e there exists a gr invariant p s h func tion on gc which is exhaustion on gc gr cf 17 which include the case when gr is compact and nilpotent cf 17 however it s pity that l c l is not a pseudoconvex pair in the case of the extended future tube conjecture we proved that the as sumption ii in the minimum principle is satisfied and the constructed function is weak exhaustion these are the main technical difficulties we overcome them and finished our proof via a consideration of the matrix form of the conjecture and explicit calculations based on hua s work and matrix techniques 9 19 some results related to group actions in several complex variables 751 theorem 38 39 the extended future tube conjecture is true a g sergeev posed an interesting idea to attack the mentioned question he assumed an invariant version of cartan s lemma if a d is a gr invariant analytic subset f o a gr then there exists an f o d gr s t f a f if this is the case we can prove that d is stein in x gc in order to prove it it s sufficient to prove d is holomorphically convex let yn d be an arbitrary discrete set then 1 yn d is a gr invariant analytic subset in d by the assumption then there exists a gr invariant holomorhic function f on d s t f 1 yn n since o d o d gr then we get a holomorphic function on d which is unbounded on yn this means that d is holomorphically convex and then 1 d is also stein when 1 d gc d i e gc d is saturated then gc d is stein it seems to be hard to prove directly the invariant version of cartan s lemma for a noncompact lie group gr although it s trivially the case for a compact lie group actually we have the following proposition 41 suppose furthermore gc d is saturated then the invariant version of cartan s lemma holds if and only if gc d is stein however we recently observed that it should be possible to directly give an answer to the above question based on l 2 methods and group actions references 1 e casadio tarabushi s trapani
