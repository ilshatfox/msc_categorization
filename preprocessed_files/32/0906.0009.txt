esti mates for the neumann problem on 0 1 forms details of several of the results and examples here do not appear in the literature but versions of them have been known to the authors and a few others for a long time and some have been men tioned without proof such as in dk recent interest in this subject helps justify including them furthermore the situation in two complex dimensions has long been completely understood one of the main results there is due to rothschild and stein rs and hence fits nicely into this volume first we briefly recall the definition of subelliptic estimate and one consequence of such an estimate see bs c 1 c 2 c 3 dk k 4 k 5 kn for consid erable additional discussion we then discuss the situation in two complex dimen sions where things are completely understood we go on to describe two methods for proving such estimates kohn s method of subelliptic multipliers and catlin s method of construction of bounded plurisubharmonic functions with large hessians we provide in proposition 4 4 an example exhibiting the failure of effectiveness for kohn s algorithm for finding subelliptic multipliers and we give a simplified situation theorem 5 1 in which one can understand this algorithm perfectly this section is taken from d 5 we go on to discuss some unpublished examples of the first author these examples provide surprising but explicit information about how the largest possible value of the parameter that arises in a subelliptic estimate is related to the geometry of the boundary see example 7 1 and theorem 7 2 both authors acknowledge discussions with joe kohn over the years and the second author acknowledges support from nsf grant dms 07 53978 2 definition of subelliptic estimates let be a pseudoconvex domain in cn with smooth boundary and assume that p b let t 1 0 b be the bundle whose sections are 1 0 vectors tangent to b we may suppose that there is a neighborhood of p on which b is given by the vanishing of a smooth function r with dr p 6 0 in coordinates a vector field l n j 1 aj zj is a local section of t 1 0 b if on b n j 1 aj z rzj z 0 1 then b is pseudoconvex at p if whenever 1 holds we have n j k 1 rzjzk p aj p ak p 0 2 1 http arxiv org abs 0906 0009 v 1 2 david w catlin and john p d angelo it is standard to express 2 more invariantly the bundle t 1 0 b is a subbundle of t b c the intersection of t 1 0 b with its complex conjugate bundle is the zero bundle and their direct sum has fibers of codimension one in t b c let be a non vanishing purely imaginary 1 form that annihilates this direct sum then 1 and 2 together become l l l l 0 3 on b for all local sections of t 1 0 b formula 3 defines a hermitian form on t 1 0 b called the levi form the levi form is defined only up to a multiple but this ambiguity makes no difference in what we will do the domain or its boundary b is called pseudoconvex if the levi form is definite everywhere on b in this case we multiply by a constant to ensure that it is nonnegative definite the boundary is strongly pseudoconvex at p if the levi form is positive definite there each smoothly bounded domain has an open subset of strongly pseudoconvex boundary points the point farthest from the origin must be strongly pseudoconvex and strong pseudoconvexity is an open condition subelliptic estimates arise from considering the complex on the closed domain as usual in complex geometry we have notions of smooth differential forms of type p q we will be concerned only with the case of 0 1 forms here similar examples and results apply for forms of type p q a smooth differential 0 1 form n j 1 jdz j defined near p lies in the domain of if the vector field n j 1 j zj lies in t 1 0 z b for z near p the boundary condition for being in the domain of therefore becomes j r zj 0 on the set where r 0 let denote the l 2 norm and let denote the sobolev norm of where can be either a function or a differential form the sobolev norm involves fractional derivatives of order of the components of definition 2 1 a subelliptic estimate holds on 0 1 forms at p if there is a neighborhood u of p and positive constants c and such that 4 holds for all forms compactly supported in u and in the domain of 2 c 2 2 2 4 in this paper we relate the largest possible value of the parameter for which 4 holds to the geometry of b perhaps the main interest in subelliptic estimates is the fundamental local reg ularity theorem of kohn and nirenberg kn in the statement of the theorem the canonical solution to the inhomogeneous cauchy riemann equation is the unique solution orthogonal to the holomorphic functions theorem 2 1 let be a smoothly bounded pseudoconvex domain and assume that there is a subelliptic estimate at a boundary point p then there is a neighborhood u of p in with the following property let be a 0 1 form with l 2 coefficients and 0 let u be the canonical solution to u then u is smooth on any open subset of u on which is smooth it has been known for nearly fifty years k 1 k 2 fk that there is a subellip tic estimate with 1 2 at each strongly pseudoconvex boundary point one is also interested in global regularity see bs for a survey of results on global regularity subelliptic estimates 3 of the canonical solution in particular on each smoothly bounded pseudoconvex domain there is a smooth solution to u when is smooth and 0 but the canonical solution itself need not be smooth 3 subelliptic estimates in two dimensions let be a pseudoconvex domain in c 2 with smooth boundary m and suppose p m the statement of theorem 3 1 below resulting by combining the work of several authors completely explains the situation assume that r is a defining function for m near p we may choose coordinates such that p is the origin and r z 2 re z 2 f z 1 im z 2 5 where df 0 0 we let t m p denote the maximum order of contact of one dimensional complex analytic curves with m at p and we let treg m p denote the maximum order of contact of one dimensional regular complex analytic curves with m at p we let t m p denote the type of m at p defined as follows let l be a type 1 0 vector field on m with l p 6 0 then type l p is the smallest integer k such that there is an iterated bracket lk l 1 l 2 lk for which each lj is either l or l and such that lk p 6 0 this number measures the degeneracy of the levi form at p it is independent of the choice of l as t 1 0 p m is one dimensional we put t m p type l p in two dimensions there is an equivalent method for computing t m p consider the levi form l l as a function defined near p we ask how many derivatives one must take in either the l or l direction to obtain something non zero at p then c l p is defined to be two more than this minimum number of derivatives we add two because the levi form already involves two derivatives in two dimensions it is easy to see that type l p c l p this conclusion is false in higher dimensions when the levi form has eigenvalues of opposite signs at p it is likely to be true on pseudoconvex domains see d 1 for more information in c 2 there are many other ways to compute the type of a point the easiest one involves looking at the defining function directly with f as in 5 both of these concepts and also both versions of orders of contact mentioned above equal the order of vanishing of the function f z 1 0 at the origin things are much more subtle and interesting in higher dimensions regarding these various measurements see d 1 both the geometry and the estimates are easier in c 2 than in higher dimensions the following theorem explains fully the two dimensional case theorem 3 1 let be a smoothly bounded pseudoconvex domain in c 2 and suppose p b the following are equivalent 1 there is a subelliptic estimate at p with 1 2 m but for no larger value of 2 for l a 1 0 vector field on b with l p 6 0 we have type l p 2 m 3 for l as in 2 we have c l p 2 m 4 there is an even integer 2 m such that t b p 2 m 5 there is an even integer 2 m such that treg m p 2 m kohn k 3 established the first subelliptic estimate for domains in c 2 assuming that type l p was finite greiner gr established the converse to establish the 4 david w catlin and john p d angelo sharp result that could be chosen to be the reciprocal of type l p kohn invoked results of rothschild stein rs based on the notion of nilpotent lie groups these difficult results establish the equivalence of 1 and 2 above also see for example cns among the many references for estimates in other function spaces for solving the cauchy riemann equations in two dimensions the geometry in two dimensions is easy to understand it is quite easy to establish that condition 2 is equivalent to the other conditions from theorem 3 1 and hence we listed all five conditions in higher dimensions however the geometry is completely different nonetheless based on theorem 3 1 one naturally seeks a geometric condition for subellipticity in higher dimensions 4 subelliptic multipliers we next consider the approach of kohn from k 4 for proving subelliptic esti mates let e denote the ring of germs of smooth functions at p recall that u denotes the l 2 norm of u we use this notation whether u is a function a 1 form or a 2 form we write u for the sobolev norm definition 4 1 assume f e we say that f is a subelliptic multiplier at p if there are positive constants c and and a neighborhood u such that f 2 c 2 2 2 6 for all forms supported in u and in the domain of we will henceforth write q for 2 2 2 by definitions 2 1 and 4 1 a subelliptic estimate holds at p if and only if the constant function 1 is a subelliptic multiplier at p we recall that when b is strongly pseudoconvex at p we can take 1 2 in 4 the collection of subelliptic multipliers is a non trivial ideal in e closed under taking radicals furthermore the defining function r and the determinant of the levi form det are subelliptic multipliers we state these results of kohn k 4 proposition 4 1 the collection i of subelliptic multipliers is a radical ideal in e in particular if fn i for some n then f i also r and det are in i r 21 cq 7 det 21 2 cq 8 kohn s algorithm starts with these two subelliptic multipliers and constructs additional ones we approach the process via the concept of allowable rows an n tuple f 1 fn of germs of functions is an allowable row if there are positive constants c and such that for all as in the definition of subelliptic estimate j fj j 2 cq 9 the most important example of allowable row is for each j the j th row of the levi form namely the n tuple rz 1 zj rznzj the following fundamental result of kohn enables us to pass between allowable rows and subelliptic multipliers subelliptic estimates 5 proposition 4 2 let f be a subelliptic multiplier such that f 22 q 10 then the n tuple of functions f z 1 f z 1 is an allowable row and we have j f zj j 2 cq 11 conversely consider any n n matrix fij of allowable rows then det fij is a subelliptic multiplier proof see k 4 or d 1 for domains with real analytic boundary kohn s process always terminates in finitely many steps depending on only the dimension following the process pro duces two lists of finite length one of modules of allowable rows the other of subelliptic multipliers the value of the obtained from this process depends on both the length of this list and the number of radicals taken in each step we will show that there is no positive lower bound on the value of in a subelliptic estimate obtained from kohn s process in general in order to do so we recall some geometric information and notation from d 1 and d 2 for a real hypersurface m in cn we recall that t m p denotes the maximum order of contact of one dimensional complex analytic varieties with m at p we compute this number as follows let z denote the order of vanishing operator let z be a parametrized holomorphic curve with z 0 p we compute the ratio t m p z z r z and call it the order of contact of the curve z with m at p then t m p is the supremum over z of t m p z later we will generalize this concept next we consider the ring of germs of holomorphic functions o at 0 in cn some of the ideas also apply to the formal power series ring at times we write r or rn when the statement applies in either setting see cho for a treatment of kohn s algorithm in the formal power series setting the maximal ideal in o is denoted by m if i is a proper ideal in o then the nullstellensatz guarantees that its variety v i is an isolated point if and only if the radical of i equals m in this case the intersection number d i plays an important role in our discussions we put d i dimco i for such an ideal i we also consider its order of contact t i defined analo gously to the order of contact with a hypersurface this number provides a slightly different measurement of the singularity than does d i see d 1 and d 5 for precise information the following proposition is a special case of results from d 2 and k 4 it gives a simple situation where one can relate the geometry to the estimates note that the geometric conditions 3 through 6 state in various ways that there is no complex analytic curve in b through 0 proposition 4 3 let be a pseudoconvex domain in cn for which 0 b and there are holomorphic functions hj such that the defining equation near 0 can be 6 david w catlin and john p d angelo written as r z re zn n j 1 hj z 2 12 the following are equivalent 1 there is a subelliptic estimate on 0 1 forms 2 there is no complex analytic one dimensional curve passing through 0 and lying in b 3 t b 0 is finite 4 v zn h 1 hn 0 5 the radical of the ideal zn h 1 hn is m 6 d zn h 1 hn is finite our next example is of the form 12 but it illustrates a new quantitative result let be a pseudoconvex domain in c 3 whose defining equation near the origin is given by r z re z 3 z m 1 2 zn 2 z 2 z k 1 2 13 we assume that k m 2 and n 3 we note that t b 0 2 max m n and that d zm 1 z n 2 z 2 z k 1 z 3 mn in the next result we show that kohn s algorithm for finding subelliptic multipliers gives no lower bound for in terms of the dimension and the type proposition 4 4 failure of effectiveness let be a pseudoconvex domain whose boundary contains 0 and which is defined near 0 by 13 then the root taken in the radical required in the second step of kohn s algorithm for subelliptic multipliers is at least k and hence it is independent of the type at 0 in particular the procedure in k 4 gives no positive lower bound for in terms of the type proof let be a domain in cn 1 defined near the origin by 13 by the discussion in k 4 d 1 or d 5 kohn s algorithm reduces to an algorithm in the ring o in two dimensions we therefore write the variables as z w and consider the ideal h defined by zm wn wzk in two variables the exponents are positive integers we assume k m 2 and n 3 note that d h mn and t h max m n we write g z w wn wzk and we use subscripts on g to denote partial derivatives the algorithm begins with the collection m 0 of allowable rows spanned by 14 and the ideal i 0 given in 15 zm 1 0 gz gw 14 there is only one determinant to take and therefore i 0 rad z m 1 gw zgw 15 by definition m 1 is the union of m 0 and d zgw zgwz gw dz zgwwdw using the row notation as before we see that the spanning rows of m 1 are given by 16 zm 1 0 gz gw zgwz gw zgww 16 subelliptic estimates 7 it follows that i 1 is the radical of the ideal j 1 generated by the three possible determinants the ideal generated by zgw and the two new determinants is j 1 zgw z mgww zgzgww zgwgzw g 2 w 17 it is easy to see that i 1 rad j 1 m 18 thus m 2 includes dz and dw and hence i 2 1 the crucial point concerning effectiveness involves the radical taken in passing from j 1 to i 1 we prove that we cannot bound this root in terms of m and n to verify this statement we claim that zk 1 is not an element of j 1 this claim shows that the number of roots taken must be at least k since k can be chosen independently of m and n and also arbitrarily large there is no bound on the number of roots taken in terms of the dimension 2 and the intersection number d h mn or the order of contact t i max m n it remains to prove the claim if zk 1 j 1 then we could write zk 1 a z w zgw b z w z mgww c z w zgzgww zgzw g 2 w 19 for some a b c we note that gww z 0 0 that gw z 0 z k and gzw z 0 kzk 1 using this information we set w 0 in 19 and obtain zk 1 a z 0 zk b z 0 0 c z 0 zkzk 1 0 20 it follows from 20 that zk 1 is divisible by zk this contradiction proves that zk 1 is not in j 1 and hence that passing to i 1 requires at least k roots it is easy to show but the information is not needed here that taking k roots suffices this proposition shows that one cannot take radicals in a controlled fashion un less one revises the algorithm one might naturally ask whether we can completely avoid taking radicals the following example shows otherwise example 4 1 put n 2 and let h denote the three functions z 2 zw w 2 then the three jacobians obtained are z 2 2 w 2 4 zw if we tried to use the ideal gen erated by them instead of its radical then the algorithm would get stuck we elaborate the functions z 2 zw w 2 are not known to be subelliptic multipliers at the start after we compute i 0 however they are known to be subelliptic multi pliers and hence we are then allowed to take the radical this strange phenomenon we cannot use these functions at the start but we can use them after one step illustrates one of the subtleties in kohn s algorithm 5 triangular systems two computational difficulties in kohn s algorithm are finding determinants and determining radicals of ideals we describe a nontrivial class of examples for which finding the determinants is easy at each stage we require only determinants of triangular matrices furthermore we avoid the computation of uncontrolled radicals for this class of examples we never take a root of order larger than the underlying dimension in order to do so we deviate from kohn s algorithm by treating the modules of 1 0 forms differently 8 david w catlin and john p d angelo we call this class of examples triangular systems the author introduced a version of these examples in d 4 using the term regular coordinate domains but the calculations there give a far from optimal value of the parameter in a subelliptic estimate the version in this section thus improves the work from d 4 catlin and cho cc and independently kranh and zampieri kz have recently established subelliptic estimates in some specific triangular systems the crucial point in this section is that triangular systems enable one to choose allowable rows in kohn s algorithm one at a time and with control on all radicals in theorem 5 1 we establish a decisive result on effectiveness for triangular systems definition 5 1 triangular systems let h be a collection of nonzero elements of m rn we say that h is a triangular system of full rank if possibly after a linear change of coordinates there are elements h 1 hn h such that 1 for each i with 1 i n we have hi zj 0 whenever j i in other words hi depends on only the variables z 1 zi 2 for each i with 1 i n hi 0 zi 6 0 here 0 zi is the i tuple 0 0 zi it follows from 1 that the derivative matrix dh hi zj for 1 i j n is lower triangular all the entries above the main diagonal vanish identically it follows from 2 that hi zi 0 zi 6 0 by combining these facts we see that j det dh is not identically zero our procedure makes no use of the other elements of h of course any ideal defining a zero dimensional variety contains a triangular system of full rank we are assuming here additionally that the differentials of these functions define the initial module of allowable rows remark 5 1 triangular systems of rank less than n are useful for understanding the generalization of the algorithm where we consider q by q minors we do not consider these systems here and henceforth we drop the phrase of full rank assuming that our triangular systems have full rank let h be a triangular system after renumbering we may assume that h 1 is a function of z 1 alone h 2 is a function of z 1 z 2 and so on note that h 1 z 1 zm 11 u 1 z 1 for a unit u 1 that h 2 z 1 z 2 z 2 u 2 z 2 z 1 g 2 z 1 z 2 for a unit u 2 and so on after changing coordinates again we may assume that these units are constant for example zm 11 u 1 z 1 m 1 1 where 1 is a new coordinate we may therefore assume that a triangular system includes functions h 1 hn as follows h 1 z z m 1 1 21 1 h 2 z z m 2 2 z 1 g 21 z 1 z 2 21 2 h 3 z z m 3 3 z 1 g 31 z 1 z 2 z 3 z 2 g 32 z 1 z 2 z 3 21 3 hn z z mn n n 1 j 1 zjgnj z 1 zn 21 n in 21 the holomorphic germs gkl are arbitrary our approach works uniformly in them corollary 5 1 but the from kohn s algorithm depends upon them each hj depends upon only the first j variables and has a pure monomial in zj a useful special case is where each hj is a weierstrass polynomial of degree mj in zj whose coefficients depend upon only the first j 1 variables subelliptic estimates 9 example 5 1 write the variables z w in two dimensions the pair of functions h z w h 1 z w h 2 z w z m wn zg z w 22 where g is any element of r 2 form a triangular system lemma 5 1 let h 1 hn define a triangular system in rn and let h denote the ideal generated by them then d h n j 1 mj 23 proof there are many possible proofs one is to compute the vector space di mension of rn h by listing a basis of this algebra the collection z for 0 i mi 1 is easily seen to be a basis we next provide an algorithm that works uniformly over all triangular systems the result is a finite list of pairs of subelliptic multipliers the length of the list is the multiplicity from 23 the first pair of multipliers is a 1 b 1 where both a 1 and b 1 equal the jacobian the last pair is 1 1 the number of pairs in the list is exactly the multiplicity or length of the ideal h the key point is that each aj is obtained from bj by taking a controlled root of some of its factors in other words each bj divides a power of aj and the power never exceeds the dimension we remark that the proof appears at first glance to be inefficient as delicate machinations within it amount to lowering an exponent by one this inefficiency arises because the proof works uniformly over all choices of the gij in 21 perhaps the proof could be rewritten as an induction on the multiplicity theorem 5 1 there is an effective algorithm for establishing subelliptic estimates for domains defined by triangular systems that is let h 1 hn define a trian gular system with l d h mj the following hold 1 there is a finite list of pairs of subelliptic multipliers b 1 a 1 bl al such that b 1 a 1 det hi zj also bl al and bl is a unit 2 each bj divides a power of aj the power depends on only the dimension n and not on the functions hj in fact we never require any power larger than n 3 the length l of the list equals the multiplicity d h given in 23 proof the proof is a complicated multiple induction for clarity we write out the cases n 1 and n 2 in full when n 1 we never need to take radicals when n 1 we may assume h 1 z 1 z m 1 1 we set b 1 a 1 z 1 h 1 and we set bj aj z 1 jh 1 then b 1 is a subelliptic multiplier and each bj 1 is the derivative of bj and hence also a subelliptic multiplier it is the determinant of the one by one matrix given by dbj since h 1 vanishes to order m 1 at the origin the function bm 1 is a non zero constant thus 1 holds here l m 1 and hence 3 holds since bj aj we also verify that the power used never exceeds the dimension and hence 3 holds thus the theorem holds when n 1 we next write out the proof when n 2 the initial allowable rows are dh 1 and dh 2 giving a lower triangular two by two matrix because h 1 z 2 0 we set b 1 a 1 det hi zj dh 1 dh 2 10 david w catlin and john p d angelo where we use the following convenient notation dhk hk zk 24 for 1 j m 2 we set bj dh 1 2 djh 2 25 1 aj dh 1 d jh 2 25 2 each bj 1 is a subelliptic multiplier obtained by taking the determinant of the allowable matrix whose first row is dh 1 and second row is daj recall that d m 2 h 2 is a unit when j m 2 in 25 2 we therefore find that am 2 is a unit times dh 1 the collection of multipliers is an ideal and hence dh 1 is a subelliptic multiplier we may use d dh 1 as a new allowable first row therefore bm 2 1 d 2 h 1 dh 2 using d h 1 as the first row and d bm 2 1 as the second row we obtain bm 2 2 d 2 h 1 2 d 2 h 2 am 2 2 d 2 h 1 d 2 h 2 notice again that we took only a square root of the first factor more precisely a 2 k is divisible by bk where k m 2 2 thus each ak is a multiplier as well proceeding in this fashion we obtain am 2 j d 2 h 1 d jh 2 and therefore a 2 m 2 is a unit times d 2 h 1 thus d d 2 h 1 is an allowable row we increase the index by m 2 in order to differentiate h 1 once applying this procedure a total of m 1 times we see that bm 1 m 2 is a unit we started with a 1 b 1 otherwise each bj divides a 2 j since each bj is a determinant of a matrix of allowable rows each bj is a subelliptic multiplier therefore each aj is a subelliptic multiplier and al bl is a unit when l m 1 m 2 we have verified 1 2 and 3 we pause to repeat why we needed to take radicals of order two in the above after establishing that aj dh 1 d jh 2 is a multiplier we use daj as an allowable row the next determinant becomes v dh 1 2 dj 1 h 2 if we use v as a multi plier then we obtain both dh 1 and d 2 h 1 as factors instead we replace v with dh 1 d j 1 h 2 in order to avoid having both dh 1 and d 2 h 1 appear we now describe this aspect of the process when n 3 before sketching the induction for n 3 we will obtain a 1 b 1 dh 1 dh 2 dh 3 after m 3 steps we will find that am 3 is a unit times dh 1 dh 2 to compute the next determinant we use dh 1 as the first row d dh 1 dh 2 as the second row and da 1 as the third row each of these includes dh 1 as a factor and hence dh 1 3 is a factor of the determinant hence we need to take a radical of order three for general n each matrix of allowable rows used in this process is lower trian gular and hence each determinant taken is a product of precisely n expressions as above the largest number of repeated factors is precisely equal to the dimension subelliptic estimates 11 now we make the induction hypothesis we assume that n 2 and that h 1 hn defines a triangular system we assume that 1 and 2 hold for all triangular systems in n 1 variables we set b 1 a 1 det hi zj dh 1 dh 2 dhn 26 we replace the last allowable row by dan and take determinants obtaining b 2 dh 1 dh 2 dhn 1 dh 1 dh 2 dhn 1 d 2 hn 27 as a subelliptic multiplier taking a root of order two we obtain a 2 dh 1 dh 2 dhn 1 d 2 hn 28 as a subelliptic multiplier repeating this process mn times we obtain amn dh 1 dh 2 dhn 1 29 as a subelliptic multiplier we use its differential damn as the n 1 st allowable row and use dhn as the n th allowable row taking determinants shows that amn 1 dh 1 dh 2 dhn 2 dh 1 dh 2 d 2 hn 1 dhn 30 is a subelliptic multiplier what we have done we are in the same situation as before but we have differentiated the function hn 1 one more time and hence we have taken one step in decreasing the multiplicity of the singularity we go through the same process mn 1 mn times and we determine that amnmn 1 is a subelliptic multiplier which depends upon only the first n 2 variables we then use its differential as the n 2 nd allowable row we obtain after mnmn 1 mn 2 steps a nonzero subelliptic multiplier independent of the last three variables by another induction after mj steps we obtain a unit each determinant is the product of n diagonal elements at any stage of the process we can have a fixed derivative of h 1 appearing as a factor to at most the first power in each of the diagonal elements similarly a derivative of dh 2 can occur as a factor only in the last n 1 diagonal elements it follows that we never need to take more than n th root in passing from the bk which is a determinant to the ak after l steps in all we obtain the unit dm 1 h 1 d m 2 h 2 d mnhn al bl as a subelliptic multiplier thus 1 2 and 3 hold corollary 5 1 let be a domain defined near 0 by re zn 1 hj z 2 where hj are as in 21 there is 0 such that the subelliptic estimate 4 holds at 0 for all choices of the arbitrary function gjk in 21 the algorithm used in the proof of theorem 5 1 differs from kohn s algorithm at each stage we choose a single function a with two properties some power of a is divisible by the determinant of a matrix of allowable rows and the differential da provides a new allowable row the algorithm takes exactly d h steps thus we do not consider the modules mk instead we add one row at a time to the list 12 david w catlin and john p d angelo of allowable 1 0 forms by being so explicit we avoid the uncontrolled radicals required in proposition 4 2 remark 5 2 the difference in this approach from k 4 can be expressed as follows we replace the use of uncontrolled radicals by allowing only n th roots of specific multipliers on the other hand we must pay by taking derivatives more often the special case when n 1 clarifies the difference the multiplicity d h is the dimension over c of the quotient algebra r h this algebra plays an important role in commutative algebra and it is worth notic ing that the process in theorem 5 1 seems to be moving through basis elements for this algebra as it finds the aj we note however that the multipliers bj might be in the ideal and hence 0 in the algebra we give a simple example example 5 2 let h z w z 2 w 2 the multiplicity is 4 we follow the proof of theorem 5 1 we have a 1 b 1 zw zw we have a 2 b 2 z z 2 we have a 3 b 3 w w 2 and finally a 4 b 4 1 1 notice that the aj give the basis for the quotient algebra whereas two of the bj lie in the ideal h to close this section we show that we cannot obtain 1 as a subelliptic multiplier when the initial set does not define an m primary ideal this result indicates why the presence of complex analytic curves in the boundary precludes subelliptic estimates on 0 1 forms in theorem 6 2 we state a more precise result from c 1 proposition 5 1 let hj m for each j and suppose h 1 hk is not m primary then the stabilized ideal from the algorithm is not the full ring rn proof since the analytic or formal variety defined by the hj is positive dimen sional we can find a convergent or formal nonconstant n tuple of power series in one variable t written z t such that hj z t 0 in r 1 for all j differentiating yields hj zk z t z k t 0 31 hence the matrix hj zk has a nontrivial kernel and so each of its n by n minor determinants j vanishes after substitution of z t since j z t 0 j zk z t z k t 0 32 hence including the 1 form dj does not change the collection of vectors annihilated by a matrix of allowable rows continuing we see that z t lies in the kernel of all new matrices we form from allowable rows and hence g z t vanishes for all functions g in the stabilized ideal since z t is not constant we conclude that the variety of the stabilized ideal is positive dimensional and hence the stabilized ideal is not rn 6 necessary and sufficient conditions for subellipticity in the previous sections we have seen a sufficient condition for subellipticity a subelliptic estimate holds if and only if the function 1 is a subelliptic multiplier there is an algorithmic procedure to construct subelliptic multipliers beginning with the defining function and the determinant of the levi form each step of the process decreases the value of known to work in 4 if however the process terminates subelliptic estimates 13 in finitely many steps then 4 holds for some positive using an important geometric result from df kohn k 4 established that the process must terminate when the boundary is real analytic and that 1 is a subelliptic multiplier if and only if there is no complex variety of positive dimension passing through p and lying in the boundary in this section we recall from c 1 c 2 c 3 a different approach to these esti mates the sufficient condition for an estimate involves the existence of plurisub harmonic functions with certain properties such functions can be used as weight functions in proving l 2 estimates see also he a related approach to the esti mates that works on lipschitz domains appears in s we wish to relate the estimate 4 to the geometry of the boundary let r be a smooth local defining function of a pseudoconvex domain and assume 0 b we consider families mt of holomorphic curves through p and how these curves contact b there for t 0 we consider nonsingular holomorphic curves gt as follows 1 gt t c n and gt 0 0 2 there is a positive constant c 2 independent of t such that on 1 we have g t c 2 3 there is a positive constant c 1 such that c 1 g t 0 we say that the order of contact of the family mt of holomorphic curves parametrized by gt with b is 0 if 0 is the supremum of the set of real numbers for which sup r gt ct 33 the holomorphic curves gt considered in this definition are all nonsingular therefore this approach differs somewhat from the approach in d 1 and d 2 where allowing germs of curves with singularities at 0 is crucial our next example provides some insight example 6 1 1 define r as follows r z re z 3 z 2 1 z 2 z 3 2 z 2 4 34 by d 1 we have t b 0 4 each curve g whose third component vanishes has contact 4 at the origin on the other hand consider a nearby boundary point of the form 0 0 ia for a real then the curve 2 ia ia ga 35 has order of contact 8 at 0 0 ia by d 2 this jump is the maximum possible see 39 below for the sharp inequality in general 2 following c 1 we jazz up this example by considering r z re z 3 z 2 1 z 2 z l 3 2 z 2 4 z 1 z m 3 2 36 for positive integers l m with 2 l m again we have t b 0 4 we will construct a family of regular holomorphic curves gt with order of contact 4 2 m l m 2 l for t and to be chosen put gt 2 it l it 37 14 david w catlin and john p d angelo then pulling back r to gt we obtain r gt 8 t 4 l 2 t 2 m 38 setting the two terms in 38 equal we obtain 6 t 4 l 2 m put 3 m 2 l and then we get t it follows that sup r gt 2 t where 4 2 m l m 2 l hence the order of contact of this family is at least in fact it is precisely this value furthermore by theorems 6 1 and 6 2 below there is a subelliptic estimate at 0 for 1 and this value is the largest possible depending on l and m the possible values of the upper bound on live in the interval 1 8 1 4 we next recall the equivalence of subelliptic estimates on 0 1 forms with finite type theorem 6 1 see c 2 and c 3 suppose that b is smooth and pseudoconvex and t b p 0 is finite then the subelliptic estimate 4 holds for some 0 theorem 6 2 see c 1 suppose that the subelliptic estimate 4 holds for some positive if mt is a family of complex analytic curves of diameter t then the order of contact of mt with b is at most 1 in two dimensions type of a point is an upper semi continuous function if the type at p is t then the type is at most t nearby in higher dimensions the type of a nearby point can be larger as well as the same or smaller sharp local bounds for the type indicate why relating the supremum of possible values of in a subelliptic estimate to the type is difficult in dimension at least 3 theorem 6 3 see d 2 let b in cn be smooth and pseudoconvex near p 0 and assume t b p 0 is finite then there is a neighborhood of p 0 on which t b p t b p 0 n 1 2 n 2 39 the bound 39 is sharp when n 2 we see that the type at a nearby point can be no larger than the type at p 0 when n 3 however the type can be larger nearby this failure of upper semi continuity of the type shows that the best epsilon in a subelliptic estimate cannot simply be the reciprocal of the type as holds in two dimensions see d 1 d 2 d 3 for more information example 7 1 below generalizes example 6 1 it is an unpublished result due to the first author all these examples are based upon a simple example found by the second author in d 3 to illustrate the failure of upper semi continuity of order of contact see d 1 and d 2 for extensions to higher dimensions and a proof of 39 7 sharp subelliptic estimates example 7 1 consider the local defining function r given by r z 2 re z 3 z m 1 1 f z 3 z 2 2 zm 22 2 z 2 g z 3 2 40 where m 1 and m 2 are integers at least 2 and f and g are functions to be chosen let b be the zero set of r assume f 0 g 0 0 it follows by d 1 that subelliptic estimates 15 t b 0 2 max m 1 m 2 and mult b 0 2 m 1 m 2 we will show that we can obtain for the reciprocal of the largest possible value of in a subelliptic estimate any value in between these two numbers by theorem 6 1 there is a subelliptic estimate according to theorem 6 2 to find an upper bound for we must find a family mt of one dimensional complex curves with certain properties we follow example 6 1 and define this family mt as follows mt is the image of the holomorphic curve t m 1 f it it 41 on the set where t pulling back r to this family of curves yields r t m 1 f it 2 m 2 m 1 f it 2 g it 2 42 reasoning as in example 6 1 we choose f and g to make the two terms in 42 equal the condition for equality is 2 m 1 m 2 2 m 1 f 2 m 2 2 g 2 43 the crucial difference now is that the functions f and g which depend on only one variable can be chosen as we wish in particular choose a parameter 0 1 and assume that f and g are chosen such that log f log g then 43 gives 2 m 1 m 2 1 log 2 m 2 1 2 log g 44 we obtain from 44 and 45 log r t 2 2 m 1 2 2 2 m 1 m 2 1 2 m 2 1 2 log 45 in order to find a value for which there is a constant c such that r c we take logs and see that we find the ratio log r log using 45 we obtain the order of contact t of this family of curves to be t 2 m 1 2 1 m 1 m 2 1 m 2 1 1 46 if in 46 we put 1 then we get t 2 m 1 if in 46 we let tend to 0 we obtain t 2 m 1 2 m 1 m 2 1 2 m 1 m 2 in the previous example we may for example choose f z zp and g z zq if we put p q then our calculations apply and 46 is rational on the other hand we can achieve the condition log f log g by allowing f and g to be functions vanishing to infinite order at 0 but which are holomorphic in the half plane re z 3 0 for example we may define f by f exp p and g the same except that p is replaced by q by doing so we can allow in 46 to be real it is easy to include the limiting value 0 by setting g 0 in order to finish we have to discuss sufficiency the first author uses the method of weighted l 2 estimates we let h denote the complex hessian of a smooth real valued function we say that h c if the minimum eigenvalue of the 16 david w catlin and john p d angelo hessian is at least c at each point one of the crucial steps in the proof of theorem 6 1 is the following result from c 2 based upon ideas from c 4 theorem 7 1 let be a smoothly bounded domain defined near a boundary point p by r 0 suppose that there is neighborhood u of p such that the following holds for each 0 we can find a smooth function satisfying 1 1 on u thus is uniformly bounded 2 is plurisubharmonic on u thus h 0 on u 3 h c 2 on u r 0 thus the hessian of blows up in a precise manner as we approach the boundary then there is a subelliptic estimate of order at p using this result it is possible to say more about example 7 1 one can choose f and g there such that there is a subelliptic estimate of order at the origin where is the reciprocal of the number t in 46 in particular for every 0 in the range 1 2 m 1 m 2 1 2 m 1 there is a domain in c 3 such that the largest possible value of in a subelliptic estimate is 0 by changing the function g appropriately one can create the situation of part 2 of the next result theorem 7 2 let 0 be in the interval 0 1 4 1 there is a smooth pseudoconvex domain in c 3 with defining function 40 such that the subelliptic estimate 4 holds with equal to 0 but for no larger value of in addition if 0 in the same range is rational then we can choose the domain to be defined by 40 where f z zp and g z zq and hence the defining equation is a polynomial 2 there is also a smooth pseudoconvex domain in c 3 with defining equation 40 such that the estimate 4 holds for all with 0 0 but for which the estimate fails at 0 theorem 7 2 can be extended to higher dimensions it is much harder to under stand subelliptic estimates on 0 1 forms in three or more dimensions than it is in two dimensions the theory for 0 1 forms in two dimensions is analogous to the theory for 0 n 1 forms in n dimensions in these cases there is no need to consider the contact with singular varieties and hence issues involving subelliptic estimates are controlled by commutators we conclude by observing that connec tions between the analysis and the commutative algebra involved do not reveal themselves in two dimensions or more generally when we consider estimates on 0 n 1 forms hence
