sufficiently complicated that there are no universal model domains with which to compare a general domain good models may be con structed by bumping outward a pseudoconvex finite type c 3 in such a way that i pseudoconvexity is preserved ii the locally larger domain has a simpler defining function and iii the lowest possible orders of contact of the bumped domain with at the site of the bumping are realised when cn n 3 it is in general hard to meet the last two requirements such well controlled bumping is possible when is h extendible semiregular we examine a family of domains in c 3 that is strictly larger than the family of h extendible semiregular domains and construct explicit models for these domains by bumping 1 introduction a rather successful strategy for understanding a pseudoconvex domain in cn n 2 involves carefully deforming its boundary about some boundary point without destroying pseudoconvexity so that the new domain well approximates the original but has a much simpler defining function in many instances one requires the model domain to be deformed outwards about the chosen boundary point the latter procedure is formalised as follows given a smoothly bounded pseudoconvex domain cn n 2 and find a neighbourhood u of and a c 2 smooth function psh u such that 1 0 is a smooth hypersurface in u that is pseudoconvex from the side u z z 0 and 0 but u u we shall call the triple u a local bumping of about fornaess and sibony 10 devised a procedure of bumping to show that every boundary point of a finite type domain in c 2 admits a holomorphic peak function the works 9 12 are just some of the many applications of bumping in c 2 going beyond c 2 diederich and fornaess 7 have shown that if is a bounded pseudoconvex domain with real analytic boundary then local bumpings always exist about each however the applications cited above rely on a second ingre dient that the bumpings constructed are in some sense well adapted to the pair to be more specific it is highly desirable for a local bumping u to have the following two properties b 1 the orders of contact of u with 1 0 at along various directions v t it are the lowest possible 2000

in part by a grant from the ugc under dsa sap phase iv 1 http arxiv org abs 1010 4451 v 2 2 gautam bharali b 2 the function is as simple as possible and is explicitly known the difficulty with the results of 7 is that when cn and n 3 the order of contact between and 1 0 at along certain complex tangential directions can be very high furthermore the great generality of the scope of 7 makes it very hard for an explicit equation for to be discernable yet there has been some progress which generalises the situation in 10 in achieving so that the local bumping has the properties b 1 and b 2 to appreciate this we need to define the catlin normal form for a pair to this end we refer the reader to catlin 3 for a definition of the catlin multitype definition 1 1 let be a pseudoconvex domain in cn 1 n 1 having c smooth boundary and let let 1 m 1 mn be the catlin multitype of at and suppose mj j 1 n then by 3 main theorem there exists a local holomorphic coordinate system u w z 1 zn centered at which we shall call distinguished coordinates such that u w z v rew p z q z r imw z 0 1 1 where v is a neighbourhood of 0 c n 1 and where p is an m 1 mn homogeneous plurisubharmonic polynomial in c n that has no pluriharmonic terms d d q 0 0 whenever nn nn such that n j 1 m 1 j j j 1 and there exists a smooth function s defined about 0 r such that r x z s x x o z 1 m 1 zn mn as x z 0 any presentation of in a neighbourhood of having the form 1 1 will be called a catlin normal form for we remind the reader that given an n tuple 1 n p is said to be homogeneous if p t 1 1 z 1 t 1 nzn tp z 1 zn z z 1 zn c n and for every t 0 the behaviour of the the term r above is already implicit in 3 but has been made explicit in 14 following an argument by fornaess sibony 10 let the pair be as in definition 1 1 if the model domain p w z c cn rew p z 0 where p is the polynomial occurring in 1 1 is of finite type then it was shown independently by yu in 13 and by diederich herbort in 8 that one can make a holomorphic change of the w coordinate and find a neighbourhood v of 0 c n 1 and an m 1 mn homogeneous function h c 1 cn that is positive away from 0 such that p h psh cn and u w z v rew p z h z 0 1 2 with as above whenever the model domain p associated to its catlin normal form at some is of finite type we say that is h extendible at or alternatively that is h extendible it is evident that the bumping represented by the right hand side of 1 2 also has the properties b 1 and b 2 are such elementary model domains available when the pair is not h extendible the answer to the above question is definitively no yu in 13 and diederich herbort in 8 have independently shown that model domains and bumping 3 fact 1 2 an m 1 mn homogeneous h as in 1 2 exists if and only if there are no complex subvarieties of cn of positive dimension along which p is harmonic the purpose of this paper is to show that if the domain in question is in c 3 and for the chosen boundary point the structure of the exceptional complex varieties along which p in the notation of 1 1 is not too complicated then one can construct a local bumping u that has the properties b 1 and b 2 and in particular is not much more complicated than the formula occurring in 1 2 the class of pointed domains we shall discuss is strictly larger than the class of h extendible pairs the precise definition will be given in the next section but a representative of the class that we will study is example 1 3 w z c c 2 re w z 1 6 z 2 2 z 1 8 15 7 z 1 2 re z 61 z 2 10 0 note that 0 is not an h extendible pair because p z 1 z 2 z 1 6 z 2 2 z 1 8 15 7 z 1 2 re z 61 the above example is already in catlin normal form at 0 is harmonic along the complex line z 1 z 2 c 2 z 1 0 the purpose of this paper is to construct model bumpings for domains of the class to which example 1 3 belongs 2 statement of results we begin with some notation that is relevant to the definitions and results in this section let p be an m 1 m 2 homogeneous plurisubharmonic polynomial on c 2 m 1 m 2 z and define p z c 2 hc p z is not strictly positive definite c p the set of all irreducible complex curves x c 2 such that p is harmonic along the smooth part of x e p the class of all curves of the form z 1 z 2 z m 1 gcd m 1 m 2 1 z m 2 gcd m 1 m 2 2 c along which p is harmonic understanding that p is harmonic along z 1 z 2 c 2 z 2 0 where hc p z denotes the complex hessian of p at z c 2 here p is the prototype for the lowest weight polynomial that occurs in a catlin normal form see 1 1 the set e p will be the focus of our attention this is because whenever c p 6 then e p 6 this follows by making the obvious modifications to allow for the fact that p is m 1 m 2 homogeneous to the proof of the following observation by noell result 2 1 lemma 4 2 11 let p be a homogeneous plurisubharmonic non pluriharmonic polynomial in cn n 2 suppose there exist complex analytic va rieties of positive dimension in cn along which p is harmonic then there exist complex lines through the origin in cn along which p is harmonic note that in view of fact 1 2 if a pair is not h extendible then e p 6 our claim is that loosely speaking the levi geometry around a boundary point is tractable enough to enable simple bumpings about for those non h extendible pairs for which a catlin normal form has the property that c p contains no 4 gautam bharali complex curves other than those in e p however we need to make this assertion precise to do so we need the following object an m 1 m 2 wedge in c 2 is defined to be a set w having the property that if z 1 z 2 w then t 1 m 1 z 1 t 1 m 2 z 2 w t 0 the terms open m 1 m 2 wedge and closed m 1 m 2 wedge will have the usual meanings note that when m 1 m 2 2 k the true homogeneous case an m 1 m 2 wedge is simply a cone we also clarify that in what follows finite type will be used in the sense of d angelo i e if is of finite type at we will mean that the 1 type 1 see 5 for a definition is finite we can now present our key definition definition 2 2 let be a pseudoconvex domain in c 3 having c smooth bound ary and let let 1 m 1 m 2 be the catlin multitype of at we say that is almost h extendible at or alternatively that is almost h extendible if is of finite type at and for some consequently for every system of distinguished coordinates for the lowest weight plurisubharmonic polynomial p occurring in the normal form 1 1 has the following property p x e p x contains no complex subvarieties of positive dimension and is well separated from x e p x i e there is a closed m 1 m 2 wedge w that contains p x e p x and satisfies w x e p x 0 remark 2 3 it is evident from definition 1 1 that distinguished coordinates u w z 1 z 2 need not be unique however it is easy to see that for each p i e rel ative to each system of distinguished coordinates whether e p or e p 6 and whether or not p x e p x is well separated from x e p x in the latter case is independent of the choice of distinguished coordinates furthermore m 1 m 2 z z this is not evident from the definition of the catlin multitype but is a consequence of 3 theorem 2 2 remark 2 4 observe that if is h extendible in which case e p then it is almost h extendible we must record one notational point given a system of distinguished coordinates u w z 1 zn w and zj j 1 n will interchangably denote the standard coordinates of c cn in which the normal form is presented as well as the compo nents of an injective holomorphic map w z 1 zn u c n 1 0 the pairs for which we can state our main theorem will be required to satisfy the following mild condition for each x e p and each x x 0 0 dom q ord p nx p x x ord q nx q x x and if r 0 is so small that b 3 0 r w z 1 z 2 u then r imw z imw 1 1 lcm m 1 m 2 w z b 3 0 r where m 1 m 2 and p q r are determined by the distinguished coordi nates u w z 1 z 2 and n x denotes the complex line in c 2 z that is normal to the curve x at x we have abbreviated the 1 type 1 to 1 the condition might seem like a severe restriction on the class of almost h extendible pairs so a couple of explanations are in order given a point a c and model domains and bumping 5 a smooth function f defined in a neighbourhood of a such that f a 0 we write ord f a min n z some monomial of degree n in the taylor expansion of f around a has non zero coefficient now concerning the first part of p n x p x may well vanish to infinite order in some real direction in n x but we do not require q nx q x to have the same decay along such a direction if ord p nx p x refer also to the short remark just after theorem 2 5 as for we do not require the condition on r in order to obtain a result in spirit of theorem 2 5 but there is a pragmatic reason for imposing this condition the reader is referred to remark 2 7 following theorem 2 5 we can now state the main theorem of this paper theorem 2 5 let be a pseudoconvex domain in c 3 having c smooth boundary and let assume that is almost h extendible at let 1 m 1 m 2 be the catlin multitype of at let u w z v rew p z q z r imw z 0 be the local representation of with respect to a system of distinguished coordinates u w z 1 z 2 here and below z z 1 z 2 if e p 6 then 1 e p is a finite set denoted as x 1 xn 2 suppose satisfies then we can find a system of holomorphic co ordinates u w z 1 z 2 in such a way that z z and construct a plurisub harmonic function g c c 2 0 c 2 c 2 whose orders of vanishing at 0 c 2 along various complex directions in c 2 are explicitly known and such that 0 b 3 0 r w z c 3 rew g z 0 b 3 0 r 2 1 for some r 0 the function g has the following description there exist a non negative function h 0 c c 2 0 c 2 c 2 that is m 1 m 2 homogeneous subharmonic functions vj c c 0 c 2 c that are homogeneous of degree 2 dj j 1 n and are strictly subharmonic away from 0 c and closed m 1 m 2 wedges w 1 j and w 2 j satisfying w 1 j 0 int w 2 j j 1 n such that h 10 0 n j 1 xj for each j n g z p h 0 z vj zk j z 1 z 2 w 1 j b 2 0 r where k j 1 or 2 depending on j 1 n g z 1 z 2 p h 0 z 1 z 2 z 1 z 2 c 2 nj 1 w 2 j b 2 0 r remark 2 6 we have given a part of the explanation for the assertion that the first part of condition is mild another reason for this assertion is that that condition can be dispensed with i e even without that condition a bumping theorem similar to theorem 2 5 can be deduced however the model that one would get would have a more complicated defining function than the one above since the main point of theorem 2 5 is to construct the simplest bumpings in the almost h extendible case we will assume that the the first part of is in effect 6 gautam bharali remark 2 7 the second part of the condition can also be dispensed with the theorem that one obtains without this assumption differs from theorem 2 5 in the following respect in addition to all the objects asserted to exist in theorem 2 5 there exist polynomials qj c z 1 z 2 j 1 n with deg qj 2 dj such that g z p h 0 z reqj z vj zk j z 1 z 2 w 1 j b 2 0 r where k j 1 or 2 depending on j 1 n this latter version takes some extra effort to prove but has the advantage that for domains in c 3 it subsumes the bumping results in 8 and 13 however it is not clear whether the right hand side of the above equation is simple enough to be useful in applications in contrast if we study unbounded domains of the form 1 1 with q c c 2 and r 0 then theorem 2 5 can be applied to several problems on such domains for example using theorem 2 5 one can extend in c 3 4 theorem 1 2 by chen kamimoto ohsawa to a much wider class of unbounded domains which we shall address in a forthcoming work to summarise because of the utility of the bumpings we get from theorem 2 5 we prefer to restrict attention to domains that satisfy the second part of we ought to mention that the idea of almost h extendibility comes from 2 the property that the polynomial p occurring in definition 2 2 possesses is termed property a in 2 in fact some of the preliminary steps in our proof of theorem 2 5 are variations on the work in 2 before we conclude this section let us glance at the key ideas involved in the proof of theorem 2 5 the four primary ingredients in our proof are as follows step 1 as in 2 we begin by studying the true homogeneous case i e when the catlin multitype of at is 1 2 k 2 k k 2 for each complex line x e p we can find a closed cone k x and a function hx that is supported ink x such that p hx is a bumping of p for 0 sufficiently small inside the aforementioned cone the departure from 2 here is that hx must be constructed with greater delicacy so that the precise orders of decay of hx as one approaches its zero set are known this involves some new ideas step 2 we know from 2 proposition 1 that in the homogeneous case there are finitely many complex lines x 1 xn e p we use pseudo convexity of plus the hypothesis of being of finite type at to extract summands from the taylor expansion of p q see definition 1 1 that constitute homogeneous subharmonic polynomials corresponding to each xj j 1 n a well known prescription is used to bump these polyno mials which yields the functions v 1 vn of theorem 2 5 step 3 the properties of p allow us to patch together all the functions constructed up to this point in an appropriate manner this yields the function g of theorem 2 5 we then account for those terms in the taylor expansion of p q that are not already in g k x so that we can eventually conclude that g z p q z z b 2 0 r 0 0 for some r 0 sufficiently small step 4 the analogous results for the case when the catlin multitype of at is 1 m 1 m 2 m 1 6 m 2 are obtained by applying an appropriate proper holomorphic map that pulls back the catlin normal form of to a model domains and bumping 7 domain to which the above ideas can be applied a final change of coordinate accounts for the terms in the taylor expansion of r see definition 1 1 the constructions described in the first step of the above procedure will be ex plained in section 4 the second and the third steps represent the key technical proposition of this paper they constitute proposition 5 3 which will be presented in section 5 below the final part of the above analysis will be found in section 6 3 technical preliminaries the purpose of this section is to list some results that we shall apply many times in the sections that follow to accomplish specific technical tasks we begin by stating a proposition that is essential for the proof of theorem 2 5 and from which part 1 of theorem 2 5 follows almost immediately result 3 1 proposition 1 2 let p be a plurisubharmonic non pluriharmonic polynomial in c 2 that is homogeneous of degree 2 k then there are at most finitely many complex lines passing through 0 c 2 along which p is harmonic the next result is a mild refinement of 10 lemma 2 4 by fornaess sibony in fact we do not need to alter anything in the proof of 10 lemma 2 4 the refinement lies in stating explicitly in part c below a property of the fornaess sibony construction of which there was no need in 10 but which we will need in section 4 result 3 2 let u c r be a real analytic subharmonic non harmonic function that is homogeneous of degree j assume that 1 m 0 2 u e i 0 0 2 let 0 0 be so small that k 0 k 0 0 2 and k 0 k 0 k 1 0 k 1 0 k 1 m 1 next define sk re i r 0 k k 0 0 there exist positive constants c 1 c 1 u which varies polynomially in sup z 1 u z c 2 c 2 u which varies polynomially in sup z 1 u z and 0 0 and a 2 periodic function h c r such that a 0 h x 1 x r b u jh arg z c 1 z j 2 z c and 0 1 c u jh arg z c 2 z j 2 z c m k 1 sk and 0 0 independent of here arg refers to any continuous branch of the argument remark 3 3 the 0 appearing in the above lemma must not be confused with the appearing in the statement 10 lemma 2 4 the latter is a universal constant which is a component of the constant c 1 u in our notation if we denote the of 10 lemma 2 4 by univ then our c 1 u is a polynomial function of univ and in the notation of 10 u sup z 1 u z the last technical item is a levi form calculation we will need this result in section 4 8 gautam bharali lemma 3 4 let p z 1 z 2 be a plurisubharmonic non pluriharmonic polynomial that is homogeneous of degree 2 k k 2 and assume that p 0 0 write p z 1 z 2 2 k j qj z 1 z 2 where each qj is the sum of all monomials of p that involve powers of z 1 and z 1 having total degree j j 2 k then q is plurisubharmonic proof we start with a levi form calculation for w c let us write w w ei ei where t r 2 z with this notation the levi form of p at the points w w can be written as lp w w v w 2 k 1 2 v 1 v 2 t 11 t 12 t 12 t 22 v 1 v 2 w 2 k 1 o 1 v 1 2 v 1 v 2 1 v 2 2 0 3 1 where t 11 t 12 and t 22 are trigonometric polynomials obtained when lq w w v is written out relative to the polar coordinates defined above we first note that as p psh c 2 whence 2 lq 0 0 let us assume that q psh c 2 then there exist 0 6 0 w 0 6 0 and a vector v v 1 v 2 c 2 such that lq 0 w 0 w 0 v c 0 now for each r 0 define wr rv 1 v 2 from the expression for the levi form of q in 3 1 above it clear that lq r 0 w 0 w 0 wr r lq 0 w 0 w 0 v cr 3 2 notice that by the definition of ql 2 jk ql r 0 w 0 w 0 wr jwr k o r l l 1 j k 1 2 combining this fact with 3 2 we see that there exists a positive constant 1 such that lp r 0 w 0 w 0 wr cr o r 1 0 r 0 but this contradicts the plurisubharmonicity of p hence our earlier assumption must be false and q is plurisubharmonic 4 homogeneous polynomials bumping around e p this section is devoted to making precise the ideas presented in step 1 of the outline given in section 2 in order to state the main result of this section cleanly we need the following notation for any c k will denote the open cone k z 1 z 2 c 2 z 1 z 2 z 2 note that k is a conical neighbourhood of the punctured complex line z 1 z 2 z 2 z 2 c 0 as stated in section 2 the initial ideas in the proof of the proposition below are similar to those in the proof of 2 proposition 2 the departure from 2 here is represented by the estimate in part a of proposition 4 2 below this estimate is a more precise statement than part a of 2 proposition 2 model domains and bumping 9 establishing this requires a more delicate construction which relies in part on the following result result 4 1 theorem 3 2 let q z 1 z 2 be a plurisubharmonic non harmonic polynomial that is homogeneous of degree 2 p in z 1 and 2 q in z 2 then q is of the form q z 1 z 2 u z d 1 z d 2 where d d z and u is a homogeneous subharmonic non harmonic polynomial a comment about the hypothesis imposed on p in the result below the p below is the prototype for the polynomial p described in definition 1 1 under the following assumptions the pair is such that the catlin multitype of at is 2 k 2 k is almost h extendible at with e p 6 these are encoded in the hypothesis about p k 0 l in this prototype l must be viewed as a complex line belonging to e p proposition 4 2 let p z 1 z 2 be a plurisubharmonic polynomial that is homoge neous of degree 2 k k 2 contains no pluriharmonic terms and such that p z 1 z 2 2 k j qj z 1 z 2 0 where each qj is the sum of all monomials of p that involve powers of z 1 and z 1 having total degree j write l z 1 z 2 z 1 0 and assume that there exists an 0 such that p is strictly plurisubharmonic in the cone k 0 l then there exist constants c 0 which depend only on p and a non negative function h c c 2 0 c 2 c 2 that is homogeneous of degree 2 k such that a h z 1 z 2 c z 1 z 2 2 k when 0 z 1 z 2 b for every 0 1 p h is strictly plurisubharmonic on k 0 l furthermore there is a constant b b t 0 that is independent of 0 1 and depends only on and t such that whenever t 0 1 l p h z v 1 v 2 b t z 2 k 1 v 2 z t z 2 z 1 z 2 v c 2 for every 0 1 proof from result 4 1 we deduce that there exist a homogeneous subharmonic non harmonic polynomial u and a b z such that q z 1 z 2 u z a 1 z b 2 then adopting the notation used in the proof of lemma 3 4 above we see that the levi form of p at the points w w has the form lp w w v u awa b j w av 1 b v 2 2 w 2 k 1 2 k j 1 j 2 v 1 v 2 t j 11 t j 12 t j 12 t j 22 v 1 v 2 u awa b j w av 1 b v 2 2 w 2 k 1 r v 4 1 where j w 2 a 1 w 2 a b 1 t j 11 t j 12 and t j 22 are trigonometric polynomials obtained when lqj w w v is written out in polar coordinates as described in the 10 gautam bharali proof of lemma 3 4 and where r c t c 2 r define the matrix valued function m c t c 2 2 by the relation r v m v 1 v 2 v 1 v 2 where the inner product above is the standard hermitian inner product on c 2 we wish to construct the h mentioned in the statement of this proposition by applying result 3 2 to the polynomial u consequently establishing part b of this proposition would require some estimates on the quantity r we shall begin with this task and divide our proof into three steps step 1 positivity estimates on r when v lies in a conical neighbourhood of v c 2 av 1 b v 2 0 consider the set s 1 c t ker m v 1 v 2 c 2 av 1 b v 2 0 which is clearly a real analytic subvariety of c t assume that s 1 d 0 r t 6 r 0 here and later in this proof d 0 r shall denote the punctured disc d 0 r 0 c then there exists a sequence n n n n c t such that n 0 as n and m n n b a 0 n n this implies in view of 4 1 that lp ne i n ei n b n a 0 n n but this means that p is not strictly plurisubharmonic on the set of points ne i n ei n n n which has non empty intersection with k 0 l this contradicts our hypothesis whence our assumption on s 1 is false therefore r 1 0 such that s r 1 1 s 1 d 0 r 1 t let us define the following auxiliary objects r v 2 m v v u b a b a from the following facts p is strictly plurisubharmonic on k 0 l sr 11 with r 1 lq b a 0 we conclude thatr b a 0 ond 0 r 1 t owing to the real analyticity of r we can find an exponent 1 2 k and a constant 1 0 such that i r b a 1 d 0 3 r 1 4 t ii for each t lim inf 0 r b a 1 2 in view of the identity r b a a 2 b 2 r u model domains and bumping 11 the bounds in i and ii above tell us that there is a d 0 3 r 1 4 t s 3 open neighbourhood say u of d 0 3 r 1 4 t ue it t r such that r v 1 4 a 2 b 2 v u here and later in this proof s 3 shall denote the unit euclidean sphere in c 2 from the last inequality it follows that there exists a small s 3 open neighbourhood w of ueit t r such that r v 1 4 a 2 b 2 v d 0 r 1 2 t w 4 2 and finally exploiting the relationship between r and r we infer from 4 2 that there exists a small constant 0 which depends upon the cone determined by w such that if av 1 b v 2 a v 2 bv 1 then r v 1 4 a 2 b 2 v 1 2 v 2 2 d 0 r 1 2 0 t from this we can infer that shrinking 0 if necessary if we define the closed cones c v c 2 b a v 2 v 1 b a v 2 understanding to be smaller than b a then there are small constants c 1 r 1 0 such that r v c 1 2 v 1 2 v 2 2 v d 0 r 1 t c 4 3 step 2 the structure of the set w w 6 0 and u awa b 0 and definition of h when this set is non empty let 1 m be the set associated to u 4 u as defined in result 3 2 the arguments in this part of our proof are predicated on the assumption that 1 m 6 we will consider what to do when 1 m in step 3 we compute s 1 w c 2 w 6 0 and u awa b 0 m k 1 r 0 w c 2 awa b rei k 4 4 we can apply a simple computation to 4 4 to get s 1 r m k 1 a b l 1 rei sei r s 0 k a 2 l a b 4 5 in other words for each fixed c 0 s 1 c is a collection of radial segments we now apply result 3 2 to u and let h be the 2 periodic function whose existence is asserted by result 3 2 let m z be such that u is homogeneous of degree 2 m define f rei r 2 mh rei c 12 gautam bharali now set ak sup t 0 u f ei u ei k t k t 2 k 1 m 0 1 the whole point of part b of result 3 2 is that ak 0 k m it is obvious that ak is independent of because any lowering of u f e i with respect to u ei is determined only by the cut off functions used to construct h let us now define h z 1 z 2 f z a 1 z b 2 z 1 z 2 c 2 4 6 let us also set a min 1 k m ak refer to result 3 2 for a definition of the sets sk a which are just closed sectors in c if we now define the set c 2 by r m k 1 a b l 1 rei sei r s 0 k a 2 l a b a a b then comparing this with 4 5 and the definition of a we infer w awa b sk a for some k 1 m 4 7 then from the definition of a we conclude that l q h w w v u f awa b j w av 1 b v 2 2 lq w w v w v c 2 4 8 for each 0 1 step 3 completing the proof when the set w w 6 0 and u awa b 0 is non empty in view of part b of result 3 2 the definition of h and the estimate 4 3 we have l p h w w v c 1 w 2 k 1 2 v 1 2 v 2 2 w v d 0 r 1 t c 4 9 for each 0 1 next from 4 8 and 4 1 we conclude that l p h w w v lp w w v 0 w v c 2 4 10 for each 0 1 let us stay with the case when u 1 0 0 for the moment and complete our argument for this case it now remains to account for the positivity of the levi form of p h along vectors that remain unaccounted for by the inequality 4 9 we will have to treat this under separate two cases in this part of the proof we shall use the notation jl w to denote the product l w 2 k 1 l 0 case i v c 2 v 1 b a v 2 for some c the above condition implies av 1 b v 2 b v 2 a v 1 a v 2 v 1 2 v 2 2 b a 2 1 v

there exist constants c m 0 such that exploiting the two inequalities above we may estimate l p h w w v c a 2 j 0 w v 2 2 mj 1 w v 1 2 v 2 2 j 0 w c a 2 m b a 2 1 v 2 2 w v w 1 1 2 for each 0 1 thus there exists a positive constant r 2 1 such that l p h w w v c a 2 2 j 0 w v 2 2 c 2 j 2 w v 1 2 v 2 2 4 11 w v w 1 r 2 for each 0 1 case ii v c 2 v 1 b a v 2 for some c the inequalities analogous to the ones used in case i are av 1 b v 2 a v 1 b v 2 a b a 1 v 1 v 1 2 v 2 2 b a 2 1 v 1 2 it is now evident that the previous argument goes through mutatis mutandis to yield constants c 3 r 3 0 such

min r 1 r 2 r 3 and make the following substitutions z 1 w z 2 w then the statements 4 9 4 10 4 11 and 4 12 clearly establish part b step 3 completing the proof when the set w w 6 0 and u awa b 0 is empty very similar ideas will work when u 1 0 0 in this situation step 2 is irrelevant instead we begin by defining inf 0 2 u e i note that 0 in this case we define recall that u is homogeneous of degree 2 m h z 1 z 2 2 m 2 za 1 z b 2 2 m z 1 z 2 c 2 4 13 14 gautam bharali in this situation we can repeat the entire argument given in step 3 relying once again on the two inequalities that follow the headings case i and case ii making the following replacements replace the definition of w 1 s given in case i by w 1 s w v c 2 c 2 s v 1 b a v 2 replace the definition of w 2 s given in case ii by w 2 s w v c 2 c 2 s v 1 b a v 2 replace the constant c wherever it occurs in step 3 by the constant 2 it is easy to see that this exercise leads us to the following conclusion when u 1 0 0 analogues of the estimates 4 11 and 4 12 are achieved with h as redefined in 4 13 with the newly defined wj s j 1 2 4 14 from which the desired result follows for the case u 1 0 0 5 the key proposition we are now in a position to prove the key technical proposition of this work we ought to indicate that the work in this section represents a continuation of the work done in 2 while the philosophy of the proof of proposition 5 3 below is not very different from the proof of 2 theorem 1 the estimates needed for theorem 2 5 affect the details of the proof below for instance the proof of proposition 5 3 would not work without proposition 4 2 the similarity with 2 theorem 1 is further visible in our use of the other crucial idea needed in our proof this result is derived from 11 result 5 1 version of prop 4 1 in 11 let p be a plurisubharmonic polynomial on cn that is homogeneous of degree 2 k let 0 be a connected component of p 0 having the following two properties a there exist closed cones k 1 and k 2 such that 0 int k 1 k 1 0 int k 2 and such that k 2 p 0 b 0 does not contain any complex analytic subvarieties of positive dimension along which p is harmonic then there exist a smooth function h 0 that is homogeneous of degree 2 k and constants c 0 0 which depend only on p such that int k 2 h 0 and such that for each 0 0 l p h z v c z 2 k 1 v 2 z v k 2 c n remark 5 2 the above result is not stated in precisely these words in 11 propo sition 4 1 the proof of the latter was derived from a construction pioneered by diederich and fornaess in 6 a careful comparison of the proof of 11 propo sition 4 1 with the diederich fornaess construction keeping in mind the as sumption of homogeneity in result 5 1 easily reveals that the assumption a in result 5 1 is enough to obtain the above localised version of 11 proposition 4 1 model domains and bumping 15 proposition 5 3 let u be a neighbourhood of 0 c 3 and let v be such that 0 v u 0 c 2 let r c v psh v and be such that the domain r w z u rew r z 0 is of finite type let n 2 k pn r z 1 z 2 denote the taylor expansion of r around z 0 where k 2 and each pn r is the sum of all monomials having total degree n set p p 2 k r assume that p has no pluriharmonic terms and has the properties stated in definition 2 2 if e p 6 then 1 e p is a finite collection of complex lines l 1 ln passing through the origin 2 for any x lj set j x x l j j 1 n where the orthogo nal complement is taken with respect to the standard inner product on c 2 assume that for each x lj 0 ord p j x p x x ord r j x r x x 5 1 and let j denote the generic value on lj of the left hand side of 5 1 j 1 n then there is an algebraic change of coordinate centered at 0 c 3 and a positive integer d chosen suitably so as to give us a d below such that if w z 1 z 2 denotes the new coordinates then z z and if r w z rew z 0 is the representation of r relative to the new coordinates then the associated pn contain no pluriharmonic terms for n 2 k d and p 2 k r p 2 k p furthermore there exist constants c 0 r 0 0 a non negative function h c c 2 0 c 2 c 2 that is homogeneous of degree 2 k closed cones k 1 j and k 2 j satisfying k 1 j 0 int k 2 j j 1 n and for each 0 0 a constant r 0 subharmonic functions uj c c 0 c 2 c that are homogeneous of degree 2 mj j 1 n and are strictly subharmonic away from 0 c and a function g c c 2 psh c 2 such that a g is strictly plurisubharmonic on c 2 0 b for each j n g z p h z uj zk j z 1 z 2 k 1 j b 2 0 r 0 where k j 1 or 2 depending on j 1 n c g z 1 z 2 p h z 1 z 2 z 1 z 2 c 2 nj 1 k 2 j b 2 0 r 0 d for each j

swapped and j 0 e g z c z 2 k z 1 z 2 c 2 nj 1 k 1 j b 2 0 r 16 gautam bharali proof note that part 1 follows simply from proposition 3 1 let k be the closed cone with the properties given in definition 2 2 whose existence is guaranteed by hypothesis by assumption we can find a slightly larger cone k such that p n j 1 lj int k k 0 int k and such that k n j 1 lj 0 step 1 constructing g in view of the assumption that p has no pluriharmonic terms p lj 0 please note in the interests of brevity our arguments below will be framed for complex lines in e p of the form lj z z 1 jz 2 j c only if e p z z 2 0 lj 0 then a separate argument will be provided for a statement relating to lj 0 only if that statement does not follow mutatis mutandis from the arguments given in particular for the purposes of step 1 we may assume that lj z z 1 jz 2 j 1 n the hypotheses of proposition 4 2 are satisfied by j p z 1 z 2 p z 1 jz 2 z 2 hence we can find a constant c 1 0 that depends only on p constants j 0 j 1 n that depend only on p and j functions hj c c 2 0 c 2 c 2 that are homogeneous of degree 2 k and a positive decreasing function b 0 1 r such that l p hj z v 1 v 2 b t z 2 k 1 v 2 z t j z 2 z 1 jz 2 j z 2 v c 2 5 2 hj z 1 z 2 c 1 z 1 jz 2 j z 2 2 k j z k j j lj 5 3 for t 0 1 j 1 n and for 0 1 recall that j z are as determined by the condition 5 1 note furthermore that by the finite type assumption on r if we define mj inf n z pn r lj is non harmonic on lj 2 then mj j 1 n let us now write d maxj n 2 mj it is a well known trick that we can make a global holomorphic change of coordinates and work with new coordinates w z 1 z 2 having the form w w a holomorphic polynomial in z 1 and z 2 of degree d z z 5 4 such that if the representation of r with respect to these coordinates is r w z rew z 0 then the taylor expansion of around z 0 contains no pluriharmonic terms of degree d and p 2 k r p 2 k to clarify the holomorphic polynomial that is a part of the definition of w z is the sum of all monomials in z 1 and z 2 whose real model domains and bumping 17 and imaginary parts are pluriharmonic terms in pn r n 2 k 1 d let us call this polynomial now owing to the property 5 4 of w z 1 z 2 the condition 5 1 remains unchanged when r is replaced by to un derstand this first note that the left hand side of 5 1 remains unchanged now suppose lj spanc b 1 b 2 if ox j 1 denotes the degree of the first non zero monomial in and of the taylor expansion in around 0 of r x b 2 b 1 r x then 5 1 states that ox j ord p j x p x x now as the monomials of the polynomial x b 2 b 1 x occur in the aforementioned taylor expansion the degree of the first non zero monomial in and of the taylor expansion in of x b 2 b 1 x cannot be less than ox j hence our claim none of the assertions made thus far in this proof are affected from this point we shall work with the defining function rew z and we shall simply write pn pn n z it follows from an argument very similar to the one used in the proof of lemma 3 4 that the functions uj s p 2 mj js s s c j 1 n are subharmonic non harmonic functions in particular therefore the mj s defined above are integers we invoke result 3 2 to obtain constants c 2 b 2 0 that depend only on and functions hj c c 0 c 2 c that are homogeneous of degree 2 mj j 1 n such that hj s c 2 s 2 mj s c 5 5 2 ss uj hj s b 2 s 2 mj 1 s c 0 1 5 6 j 1 n lastly in view of result 5 1 we can find a smooth function h 0 0 that is homogeneous of degree 2 k and constants b 3 0 0 such that z h 0 0 int k l p h 0 z v b 3 z 2 k 1 v 2 z v k c 2 and 0 0 5 7 let 0 be so small that 2 j j 1 n k j 2 s 3 k s 3 j n k j 2 s 3 k k 2 s 3 if j 6 k 5 8 here s 3 denotes the unit sphere in c 2 the parameter will be used to define the cones k 1 j and k 2 j j 1 n let us now define vj k j s 3 and wj k j 2 s 3 let j s 3 0 1 be a smooth cut off function such that j vj 1 and supp j wj j 1 n let us define j z j z z z c 2 0 finally if c 2 r is a function that is homogeneous of degree d 0 then 18 gautam bharali we shall abuse notation somewhat and use the expression j z z as having the following meaning j z z j z z if z 6 0 0 if z 0 note that j has the same regularity as and is homogeneous of degree d before we define g let us define a preliminary function g g z p z h 0 z n j 1 uj z 2 hj z hj z 2 j z z c 2 5 9 note that if e p z z 2 0 lj 0 then the sum on the right hand side above would contain the summand uj 0 z 1 hj 0 z hj 0 z 1 j 0 z also note that as j 1 on k j s 3 proposition 4 2 and 5 6 imply that g is strictly plurisubharmonic on k j 0 j 1 n but since strict plurisubhar monicity is an open condition we infer from continuity and homogeneity that i 1 such that g is strictly plurisubharmonic on k j for each j 1 n and for each 0 1 2 in view of i above we need to examine the levi form of g on k j 2 k j by our definition of the j s we can find a 0 such that 1 j z z k j 2 k j j 1 n furthermore an application of 5 2 and an appeal to the properties of p stated in definition 2 2 respectively imply that there exists a constant 0 such that z k j 2 k j l p uj hj hj z v 0 lp z v z 2 k 1 v 2 for each v c 2 and each j 1 n and for each 0 1 2 for each j 1 n let us write fj z 1 z 2 hj z 1 z 2 hj z 2 from the last three inequalities we can estimate lg z v 1 j z lp z v uj z 2 fj z l j z v 2 re 2 j z uj fj z v v z 2 k 1 v 2 s 1 z v s 2 z v 5 10 z k j 2 k j and v c 2 where s 1 z v and s 2 z v are as follows we first consider s 1 z v in which case we can find a large constant k 1 0 such that s 1 z v 2 2 j z hj z v v hj z l j z v k 1 z 2 k 1 v 2 z v k j 2 k j c 2 5 11 for each j 1 n in a similar way we can find a large constant k 2 0 such that s 2 z v k 2 z 2 2 mj 1 v 2 z v k j 2 k j c 2 5 12 model domains and bumping 19 for each j 1 n let 0 be so small that k 1 4 0 then we can find an r 0 0 such that in view of 5 11 and 5 12 the following holds lg z v k 1 z 2 k 1 k 2 z 2 2 mj 1 v 2 2 z 2 k 1 v 2 5 13 z k j 2 k j b 2 0 2 r 0 v c 2 and 0 for each j 1 n let us now set h h 0 n j 1 jhj 0 min 0 so far in view of i above and the bound 5 13 we have accomplished the following ii g is strictly plurisubharmonic on b 2 0 2 r 0 0 0 0 iii z h 0 int k n j 1 k j 2 lj we carry out the following three steps to transform g to g a we make a small perturbation of h to obtain a function h having the same regularity as h and homogeneous of degree 2 k such that h 1 0 n j 1 lj b ensure that the perturbation in a is so small that if we set z p z h z n j 1 uj z 2 hj z 2 j z z c 2 5 14 then is strictly plurisubharmonic on b 2 0 2 r 0 0 0 0 the process of achieving this has been described in the proof of 2 theorem 1 and hence we shall not repeat this argument c since is strictly plurisubharmonic on b 2 0 2 r 0 0 it is a well known fact that we can extend to a function g on c 2 that is strictly plurisub harmonic on c 2 0 such that b 2 0 r 0 g b 2 0 r 0 for each 0 0 5 15 from c above part 2 a of this proposition follows if we define k k j k j k k 1 2 uj uj hj for each j 1 n then in view of 5 14 and 5 15 parts 2 b and 2 c also follow the next step of this proof is to shrink r 0 to the extent necessary to obtain an r 0 so that parts 2 d and 2 e follow step 2 estimates on the size of g for the same reasons as described in step 1 we shall argue as though each lj is of the form z z 1 jz 2 for some j c analogous arguments will follow if for 20 gautam bharali some j 0 n lj 0 z z 2 0 so let us fix a j n and write pn z pn z 1 jz 2 jz 2 z 2 n c j n z 1 jz 2 1 z 1 jz 2 2 z 1 2 z 2 for each n 2 k 1 2 mj and j 1 n here and denote multi indices we clarify some notation 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 supp j n 1 2 1 2 n 4 c j n 6 0 recall that owing to the change of coordinate described in step 1 pn lj 0 for n 2 k 1 2 mj 1 thus we can conclude the following facts for n 2 k 1 2 mj 1 the condition 5 1 tells us that 1 2 1 2 supp j n j uj s 0 supp j 2 mj c 0 j 2 mj s 1 s 2 hence we get the following estimate supp j n 2 k 1 n 2 mj and 1 c j n z 1 jz 2 1 z 1 jz 2 2 z 1 2 z 2 j c j n z 1 jz 2 j z 2 n j z k j 5 16 furthermore if we write z 2 mj n 2 k pn z rj z for each j 1 n then there exists a constant k 3 0 such that rj z k 3 z 2 mj 1 z b 2 0 1 5 17 then in view of the estimates 5 3 5 5 5 16 and 5 17 there is a large constant k 4 0 such that g z c 1 z 1 jz 2 j z 2 2 k j c 2 z 2 2 mj k 4 2 mj j 2 k 1 z 1 jz 2 j z 2 n j k 3 z 2 mj 1 z k j b 2 0 1 for each j 1 n since n 2 k in every occurrence of n in the above inequality we can find an r 0 sufficiently small and a constant c 0 independent of such that g z c z 1 jz 2 j z 2 2 k j z 2 2 mj z 1 z 2 k j b 2 0 r for each j 1 n and for each 0 0 this establishes part 2 d as for part 2 e the recipe given by a c above implies that g z is dominated by a strictly negative function that is homogeneous of degree 2 k see 2 pp 53 54 model domains and bumping 21 for details in c 2 nj 1 k j provided z is small thus by arguments very similar to the preceding one part 2 e follows 6 the proof of theorem 2 5 we begin by stating that several parts of this proof are based on ideas in the proof of main theorem 1 of 2 define lcm m 1 m 2 i e the least common multiple of m 1 and m 2 and write j mj j 1 2 next define the two proper holomorphic maps c 3 c 3 s t 1 t 2 s t 1 1 t 2 2 c 2 c 2 t 1 t 2 t 1 1 t 2 2 finally write p q and r also write d w z v rew z 0 the following are easy to verify and we shall not dwell on the details r is plurisubharmonic let n m 0 n r t 1 t 2 denote the taylor expansion of r around t 0 with each n r being the sum of all monomials having total degree n then m 0 the domain 1 d is given by r s t 1 v res r t 0 write r then satisfies all the properties satisfied by p p 2 k r of proposition 5 3 refer to 2 pp 59 60 for details furthermore the domain r satisfies all the hypotheses of proposition 5 3 it would be useful to look more closely at the second assertion we state the following general fact for later use fact 6 1 let be any c smooth function defined around 0 c 2 and let r where is as defined above let n r n n be as defined above and let q be a formal rearrangement of the terms of the taylor expansion of around z 0 such that q r 1 m 1 z 1 r 1 m 2 z 2 r q z 1 z 2 r 0 if n r q then n to see this simple fact we fix a t c 2 such that n r t 6 0 thus by definition rn n r t n r rt q r 1 t 1 1 r 2 t 2 2 r 0 on the other hand q r 1 t 11 r 2 t 22 q r 1 m 1 t 11 r 1 m 2 t 22 r q t r 0 comparing the two equations above we conclude that n the second assertion above is just a special case of fact 6 1 as in the proof of proposition 5 3 in the interests of brevity we shall frame our arguments as though each curve x e p is of the form z 1 z 2 z m 1 gcd m 1 m 2 1 z m 2 gcd m 1 m 2 2 22 gautam bharali for some c and the reasons are the same as for proposition 5 3 although see the remark following 6 13 it would be useful to look at the fourth assertion above in greater depth first observe that m 1 gcd m 1 m 2 2 m 2 gcd m 1 m 2 1 and hence note that for any c such that z 1 z 2 z 2 1 z 1 2 e p is forced to be harmonic along each of the complex lines that make up the set l 1 2 1 l 0 t 1 t 2 t 1 1 1 2 exp 2 il iarg 1 2 t 2 here arg denotes some branch of the argument but since proposition 5 3 is applicable to the domain r there must be only finitely many complex lines of the above description this implies part 1 of our theorem let us introduce some notation that we shall require by part 1 and in view of the italicised remark above let us label the irreducible curves belonging to e p as x 1 xn and let us assume that xj z 1 z 2 z m

scheme let jk z denote the numbers determined by 5 1 for the pair r similarly let mjk z be the integer associated to the complex line ljk e that is provided by the proposition 5 3 let max 2 mjk 1 j n

from 6 4 result 5 1 is applicable to a careful examination of its proof reveals that noell s construction of the bumping is local hence in view of 6 2 and i we can construct the function h 0 that we use in the proof of proposition 5 3 as well as the perturbation described in a and b in the proof of proposition 5 3 in such a way that h rlm t h t u c 2 and l m z 6 5 and finally owing to 6 1 mjk mjk

then it is clear that 1 r w z 2 u rew z 0 24 gautam bharali we now pick and fix a value in 0 0 say 0 2 and use this to define the functions mentioned in the statement of our theorem to this end we define g z 1 1 2 1 a 1 2 b 1 g 0 2 z 1 1 1 exp 2 ia iarg z 1 1 6 9 z 2 1 2 exp 2 ib iarg z 2 2 w l j k l j 0 l 1 2 j 1 n 6 10 where all the objects on the right hand sides of 6 9 and 6 10 are as given in proposition 5 3 we remark here that owing to ii above we could as well have used k l jk k 0 1 2 1 in the definition 6 10 for each fixed j let us now define h 0 z 0 2 1 2 1 a 1 2 b 1 h z 1 1 1 exp 2

properties listed at the end of theorem 2 5 the task of defining the vj s is subtler if we would like to recover the second property listed at the end of theorem 2 5 we would first need to study the quantity g p h 0 w 1 j accordingly we first fix a j n then refer to the formula for 0 2 from 5 14 whence for an r 0 sufficiently small we get g p h 0 w 1 j 1 1 2 1 2 1 k 0 1 a 1 2 b 1 jk z 1 1 1 exp 2

for the meaning of the quantities ujk 0 2 in 6 12 following 5 14 strictly there should be a double sum over all possible values of j k 1 n 0 1 2 1 it is easy to see however that for z w 1 j the

2 mj that are products of integer powers of t l l and t l l l 1 2 the equation 6 6 tells us that the second factor in the expression 6 12 does not change as b ranges through the set 1 2 in view of ii iii and 6 10 the first factor in 6 12 does not change as k ranges through the set 0 1 2 1 in view of these two points the equation 6 12 reveals that the second property listed at the end of theorem 2

side of the above equation with x replaced by z 2 is just a different way of expressing the right hand side of 6 12 we claim that each vj is subharmonic to see this we note that the functions within the square brackets in 6 13 are subharmonic this follows from the following general fact fact 6 2 let d 1 and d 2 be two domains in c n and let p d 1 d 2 be a proper holomorphic map if u is a plurisubharmonic function on d 1 then the function v z t p 1 z u t z d 2 is plurisubharmonic on d 2 therefore vj being a positive linear combination of subharmonic functions is sub harmonic in fact as each ujk is by construction strictly subharmonic away from x 0 and since the map x 7 x 2 is a local biholomorphism away fron x 0 each vj is in fact strictly subharmonic on c 0 note that if for some j n say j 0 xj 0 is the z 1 axis then in view of the work done in proposition 5 3 there would be just a single uj 0 k 0 2 uj 0 0 2 accordingly the formulas 6 9 and 6 13 would reflect the following changes in defining vj 0 the ujk 0 2 s in 6 13 would be replaced by uj 0 0 2 and every occurrance of 2 would be replaced by 1 in 6 9 vj 0 would appear as a term depending on z 1 since g 0 2 is by construction plurisubharmonic on c 2 we see from fact 6 2 and the formula 6 9 that g is plurisubharmonic on c 2 at this stage we only need to establish 2 1 this will require one more holomorphic change of coordinate step 2 establishing the relation 2 1 let r 1 0 be so small that b 3 0 r 1 v shrinking r 1 further if necessary it follows from our definition 6 10 of the m 1 m 2 wedges w 1 j j 1 n and from part 2 e of proposition 5 3 applied to the domain r that there is a constant a 1 0 such that g z a 1 z 1 m 1 z 2 m 2 z 1 z 2 c 2 nj 1 w 1 j b 2 0 r 1 6 14 26 gautam bharali recall that is as given by 6 8 let us now fix a j n now obviously g z 1 1 2 1 a 1 2 b 1 g 0 2 z 1 1 1 exp 2 ia iarg z 1 1 z 2 1 2 exp 2 ib iarg z 2 2 1 1 2 1 a 1 2 b 1 y z a b 6 15 note that if z w 1 j then from our discussions above the arguments of the functions constituting the sum above would fall into one of the cones k 1 jk k 0 1 2 1 applying part 2 d of proposition 5 3 we get z w 1 j is such that z 1 1 1 e i 2 a arg z 1 1 z 2 1 2 e i 2 b arg z 2 2 lies in k 1 jk b 2 0 r 0 2 y z a b c 0 2 z 1 1 1 e i 2 a arg z 1 1 jk z 2 1 2 e i 2 b arg z 2 2 j z 2 j 2 z 2 2 mj 2 6 16 where jk j 1 1 2 exp i 2 k arg j 1 2 and where we remind the reader that j 0 j 1 2 1 j and mj 0 mj 1 2 1 mj thus if r 2 0 is so small that the the arguments of the functions constituting the right hand side of 6 15 are in b 2 0 r 0 2 then from 6 15 and 6 16 we have a non negative function nj b 2 0 r 2 0 such that g z c 0 2 nj z z 1 z 2 w 1 j b 2 0 r 2 6 17 now the whole point of the estimate in 2 d applied to the domain r above was that there exists a constant a 2 0 such that t a 2 t 1 jkt 2 j t 2 j t 2 2 mj t k 1 jk dom for all relevant j k hence if z w 1 j satisfies the hypothesis of the statement 6 16 then z has as upper bound the quantity obtained from the right hand side of 6 16 with the factor c 0 2 replaced by a 2 eventually therefore we get the estimate z a 2 nj z z 1 z 2 w 1 j b 2 0 r 2 6 18 we are now ready to establish 2 1 to this end we define new coordinates w z 1 z 2 as follows w w kw 2 zl zl l 1 2 where k 0 the mapping w z 7 w z is invertible in a neighbourhood of 0 c 3 whose size depends on the parameter k we will choose a suitable k 0 so that 2 1 is achieved recall from 6 8 the relation r imw z r imw z model domains and bumping 27 let us write rew and imw in view of there exists an a 3 0 such that r z r imw z a 3 im w f z q a 3 q im f z q w z b 3 0 r 1 2 6 19 where q 1 1 by hypothesis and where f is the polynomial described in 6 7 note that if we decompose f as f q f where the right hand side is as described in the statement of fact 6 1 and if each q f is the sum of pluriharmonic terms contained in some n r then 1 this is because r itself contains no pluriharmonic terms then in view of fact 6 1 and 6 19 and raising the value of a 3 0 if necessary we have r z a 3 q z 1 m 1 z 2 m 2 q 1 z b 2 0 r 1 2 6 20 by a similar appeal to fact 6 1 and raising a 3 0 even further if necessary nj z a 1 3 z 1 m 1 z 2 m 2 1 z 1 z 2 w 1 j b 2 0 r 2 6 21 for each j 1 n recall that max 2 mjk j n k 0 1 2 1 note that we would be done if we could show that for each w z 6 0 such that z r z 0 provided w and z are sufficiently small re w kw 2 g z 0 the above statement is true when z c 2 nj 1 w 1 j b 2 0 r 1 for r 1 0 sufficiently small and for a suitable choice of k 0 this follows from the estimate 6 14 it was shown by yu 14 pp 604 605 using an idea of fornaess sibony 10 it thus remains to establish the above statement when z w 1 j provided w z 6 0 and sufficiently close to the origin we fix j n for the following calculation and write re w kw 2 g z k 2 2 g z k 2 z r z k z r z 2 g z k 2 g z r z 2 k z 2 r z 2 provided z r z 0 w z 6 0 6 22 let us write r min r 1 2 r 2 then applying to 6 22 the estimates 6 17 6 18 and 6 20 and shrinkingr 0 if necessary so that 2 kr z 2 k 2 a 3 r z we get re w kw 2 g z k 2 2 ka 22 n 2 j z c 0 2 nj z 1 k 2 a 3 r z k 2 a 3 2 2 ka 22 n 2 j z

final holomorphic coordinates required for our theorem with k fixed we can shrink r 0 further if necessary and apply 6 21 so that the following inequalities follow let us write a a 3 1 2 k b c 0 4 and z z 1 m 1 z 2 m 2 re w kw 2 g z 2 bnj z a z 1 m 1 z 2 m 2 q 1 2 b a 3 z 1 a z q 1 z w 1 j b 3 0 r 0 6 24 the curves xj have order of contact 2 mj with at the origin hence 1 this means 1 1 1 1 1 1 applying this to 6 24 affords us an r 0 sufficiently small that re w kw 2 g z 2 b 2 a 3 z 1 0 z w 1 j b 3 0 r 0 for each j 0 n in view of our preceding remarks the proof is complete references 1 e
