mathematics see ber for an extensive discussion of many aspects of cr manifolds and mappings between them one aspect of the subject not covered in ber concerns cr mappings invariant under groups the purpose of this paper is to discuss interactions with number theory and combinatorics that arise from the seemingly simple setting of group invariant cr mappings from the unit sphere to a hyperquadric some elementary representation theory also arises the unit sphere s 2 n 1 in complex euclidean space cn is the basic example of a cr manifold of hypersurface type more generally we consider the hyperquadric q a b defined to be the subset of ca b defined by a j 1 zj 2 a b j a 1 zj 2 1 1 of course s 2 n 1 is invariant under the unitary group u n let be a finite subgroup of u n assume that f cn cn is a rational mapping invariant under and that f s 2 n 1 s 2 n 1 for most such an f must be a constant in other words for most there is no non constant invariant rational mapping from sphere to sphere for any target dimension in fact for such a non constant invariant map to exist must be cyclic and represented in a rather restricted fashion see li 1 dl and especially corollary 7 on page 187 of d 1 for precise statements and the considerable details required the restriction to rational mappings is natural for n 2 forstneric f 1 proved that a proper mapping between balls with sufficiently many continuous deriva tives at the boundary must be a rational mapping on the other hand if one makes no regularity assumption at all on the map then see li 2 one can cre ate group invariant proper mappings between balls for any fixed point free finite unitary group the restrictions on the group arise from cr geometry and the smoothness of the cr mappings considered in this paper we naturally restrict our considerations to the class of rational mappings see f 2 for considerable discussion about proper holomorphic mappings and cr geometry in order to find group invariant cr mappings from a sphere we relax the as sumption that the target manifold be a sphere and instead allow it to be a hyper quadric we can then always find polynomial examples as we note in corollary 1 1 in this paper we give many examples of invariant mappings from spheres to hyperquadrics our techniques allow us to give some explicit surprising examples 1 http arxiv org abs 0906 0007 v 1 2 john p d angelo in theorem 6 1 for example we show that rigidity fails for mappings between hy perquadrics we find non linear polynomial mappings between hyperquadrics with the same number of negative eigenvalues in the defining equations of the domain and target hyperquadrics as in the well known case of maps between spheres we must allow sufficiently many positive eigenvalues in the target for such maps to exist to get started we recall that a polynomial r cn cn c is called hermitian symmetric if r z w r w z for all z and w if r is hermitian symmetric then r z z is evidently real valued by polarization the converse also holds we note also that a polynomial in z z 1 zn and z is hermitian symmetric if and only if its matrix of coefficients is hermitian symmetric in the sense of linear algebra the following result from d 1 shows how to construct group invariant mappings from spheres to hyperquadrics throughout the paper we will give explicit formulas in many cases theorem 1 1 let be a finite subgroup of u n of order p then there is a unique hermitian symmetric invariant polynomial z w such that the following hold 1 0 0 0 2 the degree of in z is p 3 z z 1 when z is on the unit sphere 4 z w z w for all corollary 1 1 there are holomorphic vector valued invariant polynomial map pings f and g such that we can write z z f z 2 g z 2 2 the polynomial mapping z f z g z restricts to a invariant mapping from s 2 n 1 to the hyperquadric q n n where these integers are the numbers of positive and negative eigenvalues of the matrix of coefficients of the results in this paper revolve around how the mapping f g from corol lary 1 1 depends on we clarify one point at the start even if we restrict our considerations to cyclic groups then this mapping changes surprisingly much as the representation of the group changes the interesting things from the points of view of cr geometry number theory and combinatorics all depend in non trivial ways on the particular representation therefore the results should be considered as statements about the particular subgroup u n rather than as statements about the abstract group g for which g the proof of theorem 1 leads to the following formula for z w 1 1 z w 3 the first three properties from theorem 1 are evident from 3 and the fourth property is not hard to check one also needs to verify uniqueness the starting point for this paper will therefore be formula 3 we will first consider three different representations of cyclic groups and we note the considerable differences in the corresponding invariant polynomials we also consider metacyclic groups we also discuss some interesting asymptotic considerations as the order of the group tends to infinity additional asymptotic results are expected in appear in the doctoral thesis g of d grundmeier invariant cr mappings 3 an interesting result in this paper is the application in section 6 in theorem 6 1 we construct for each odd 2 p 1 with p 1 a polynomial mapping gp of degree 2 p such that gp q 2 2 p 1 q n p 2 p 1 4 these mappings illustrate a failure of rigidity in many contexts restrictions on the eigenvalues of the domain and defining hyperquadrics force maps to be linear see bh our new examples show that rigidity does not hold when we keep the number of negative eigenvalues the same as long as we allow a sufficient increase in the number of positive eigenvalues on the other hand by a result in bh the additional restriction that the mapping preserves sides of the hyperquadric does then guarantee rigidity it is quite striking that the construction of the polynomials in theorem 6 1 relies on the group theoretic methods in the rest of the paper the author acknowledges support from nsf grant dms 07 53978 he thanks both dusty grundmeier and jiri lebl for many discussions on these matters he also acknowledges the referee who spotted an error in the original presentation of example 3 3 2 properties of the invariant polynomials let be a finite subgroup of the unitary group u n and let be the unique polynomial defined by 3 our primary interest concerns how this polynomial depends on the particular representation of the group we remark at the outset that we will be considering reducible representations a simple example clarifies why if g is cyclic of order p then g has the irreducible unitary one dimensional representation as the group of p th roots of unity an elementary calculation shows that the invariant polynomial becomes simply z w zw p 5 on the other hand there are many ways to represent g as a subgroup of u n for n 2 we will consider these below for now we mention one beautiful special case let p and q be positive integers with 1 q p 1 and let be a primitive p th root of unity let p q be the cyclic group generated by the diagonal 2 by 2 matrix a with eigenvalues and q a 0 0 q 6 because a is diagonal the invariant polynomial p q z z depends on only z 1 2 and z 2 2 if we write x z 1 2 and y z 2 2 then we obtain a corresponding polynomial fp q in x and y this polynomial has integer coefficients a combinatorial interpretation of these coefficients appears in lww the crucial idea in lww is the interpretation of as a circulant determinant hence permutations arise and careful study of their cycle structure leads to the combinatorial result asymptotic information about these integers as p tends to infinity appears in both lww and d 4 the technique in d 4 gives an analogue of the szego limit theorem in the special case where q 2 these polynomials provide examples of sharp degree estimates for proper monomial mappings between balls the polynomials fp 2 have many additional beautiful properties we pause to write down the formula and state an appealing corollary these polynomials will arise in the proof of theorem 6 1 4 john p d angelo fp 2 x y 1 p 1 yp x x 2 4 y 2 p x x 2 4 y 2 p 7 corollary 2 1 d 4 let sp be the sum of the coefficients of fp 2 then the limit as p tends to infinity of s 1 p p equals the golden ratio 1 5 2 proof the sum of the coefficients is fp 2 1 1 so put x y 1 in 7 the largest in absolute value of the three terms is the middle term taking p th roots and letting p tend to infinity gives the result see dkr for degree estimates and dle for number theoretic information con cerning uniqueness results for degree estimates the following elegant primality test was proved in d 2 theorem 2 1 for each q the congruence fp q x y xp yp mod p holds if and only if p is prime we make a few comments when q 1 the polynomial fp 1 is simply x y p and the result is well known for other values of q the polynomials are more complicated when q 2 or when q p 1 there are explicit formulas for the integer coefficients for small q recurrences exist but the order of the recurrences grows exponentially with q see d 2 d 3 d 4 and g there is no known general formula for the integer coefficients nonetheless the basic theory enables us to reduce the congruence question to the special case note also that the quotient space l p q s 3 is a lens space it might be interesting to relate the polynomials fp q to the differential topology of these spaces we return to the general situation and repeat the crucial point the invariant polynomials depend on the representation in non trivial and interesting ways even in the cyclic case in order to express them we recall ideas that go back to e noether see s for considerable discussion given a subgroup of the general linear group noether proved that the algebra of polynomials invariant under is generated by polynomials of degree at most the order of given a polynomial p we can create an invariant polynomial by averaging p over the group 1 p 8 we find a basis for the algebra of invariant polynomials as follows we average each monomial z of total degree at most as in 8 to obtain an invariant polynomial often the result will be the zero polynomial the nonzero polynomials that result generate the algebra of polynomials invariant under in particular the number of polynomials required is bounded above by the dimension of the space of homogeneous polynomials of degree in n variables finally we can express the f and g from 2 in terms of sums and products of these basis elements the invariant polynomials here are closely related to the chern orbit polynomials from s the possibility of polarization makes our approach a bit different it seems a worthwhile project to deepen this connection some results in this direction will appear in g invariant cr mappings 5 3 cyclic groups let be cyclic of order p then the elements of are i a a 2 ap 1 for some unitary matrix a formula 3 becomes z w 1 p 1 j 0 1 ajz w 9 we begin by considering three different representations of a cyclic group of order six we give precise formulas for the corresponding invariant polynomials let be a primitive sixth root of unity and let be a primitive third root of unity we consider three different unitary matrices each generates a cyclic group of order six example 3 1 let be the cyclic group of order 6 generated by a where a 0 0 10 1 the invariant polynomial satisfies the following formula z z z 1 2 z 2 2 6 10 2 it follows that is the squared norm of the following holomorphic polynomial f z z 61 6 z 51 z 2 15 z 41 z 2 2 20 z 31 z 3 2 15 z 21 z 4 2 6 z 1 z 5 2 z 6 2 10 3 the polynomial f restricts to the sphere to define an invariant cr mapping from s 3 to s 13 c 7 example 3 2 let be the cyclic group of order 6 generated by a where a 0 0 11 1 the invariant polynomial satisfies the following formula z z z 1 12 z 2 12 6 z 1 2 z 2 2 2 z 1 6 z 2 6 9 z 1 4 z 2 4 11 2 note that is not a squared norm nonetheless we define f as follows f z z 61 z 6 2 6 z 1 z 2 2 z 31 z 3 2 3 z 2 1 z 2 2 11 3 then f 1 2 f 2 2 f 3 2 f 4 2 f 5 2 and the polynomial f restricts to the sphere to define an invariant cr mapping from s 3 to q 4 1 c 5 example 3 3 let be the cyclic group of order 6 generated by a where a 0 1 0 12 1 the polynomial can be expressed as follows z z x y 3 s t 3 x y 3 s t 3 12 2 where x z 1 2 6 john p d angelo y z 2 2 s z 2 z 1 t z 1 z 2 after diagonalization this information determines a holomorphic polynomial mapping f g such that f 2 g 2 it is somewhat complicated to determine the components of f and g it is nat ural to use noether s approach for this particular representation considerable computation then yields the following invariant polynomials z 31 z 3 2 p z 21 z 2 z 1 z 2 2 q z 61 z 6 2 f z 31 z 3 2 1 2 p 2 f z 1 z 5 2 2 z 51 z 2 1 2 z 41 z 2 2 2 z 21 z 4 2 h in order to write nicely we let g c z 1 z 5 2 3 z 3 1 z 3 2 2 z 51 z 2 then one can write for some c 0 as follows p 2 q 2 1 2 f z 31 z 32 2 f z 31 z 32 2 c g h 2 g h 2 12 3 we conclude that the invariant polynomial determines an invariant cr mapping f g from the unit sphere s 3 to the hyperquadric q 4 2 c 6 we have f p q 1 2 f z 31 z 32 c g h 12 4 g 1 2 f z 31 z 3 2 c g h 12 5 consider these three examples together in each case we have a cyclic group of order six represented as a subgroup of u 2 in each case we found an invariant cr mapping the image hyperquadrics were q 7 0 q 4 1 and q 4 2 the corresponding invariant mappings had little in common in the first case the map was homogeneous in the second case the map was not homogeneous although it was a monomial mapping in the third case we obtained a rather complicated non monomial map it should be evident from these examples that the mappings depend in non trivial ways on the representation invariant cr mappings 7 4 asymptotic information in this section we consider three families of cyclic groups p 1 p 2 and p p 1 for these groups it is possible to compute the invariant polynomials exactly in each case because the group is generated by a diagonal matrix the invariant polynomial depends on only x z 1 2 and y z 2 2 we will therefore often write the polynomials as functions of x and y for p 1 we have z z z 1 2 z 2 2 p x y p 13 it follows that there is an invariant cr mapping to a sphere namely the hyper quadric q p 1 0 we pause to prove 13 by establishing the corresponding general result in any domain dimension theorem 4 1 let be the cyclic group generated by i where i is the identity operator on cn and is a primitive p th root of unity then z z z 2 p z p 2 thus 1 p p 1 z 2 and hence it is independent of p proof a basis for the invariant polynomials is given by the homogeneous monomials of degree p by theorem 1 1 is of degree p in z and hence of degree 2 p overall it must then be homogeneous of total degree 2 p and it must take the value 1 on the unit sphere it therefore equals z 2 p we return to the case where n 2 where z 2 z 1 2 z 2 2 x y in the more complicated situation arising from p q the expression 1 p p q is not constant but its behavior as p tends to infinity is completely analyzed in d 4 as an illustration we perform this calculation when q 2 by expanding 3 the following formula holds see d 4 for details and precise formulas for the nj fp 2 x y p 2 z z x p 1 p 1 yp j njx p 2 jyj 14 1 here the nj are positive integers and the summation index j satisfies 2 j p the target hyperquadric now depends on whether p is even or odd when p 2 r 1 is odd the target hyperquadric is the sphere namely the hyperquadric q r 1 0 when p 2 r is even the target hyperquadric is q r 1 1 in any case using 7 under the condition x x 2 4 y 2 y we obtain fp 2 x y 1 p x x 2 4 y 2 1 hp x y 1 p 14 2 where hp x y tends to zero as p tends to infinity note that we recover corollary 2 1 by setting x y 1 we summarize this example in the following result similar results hold for the fp q for q 3 see d 4 proposition 4 1 for x x 2 4 y 2 y the limit as p tends to infinity of the left hand side of 14 2 exists and equals x x 2 4 y 2 it is also possible to compute p p 1 exactly after some computation we obtain the following z z z 1 2 p z 2 2 p j nj z 1 2 z 2 2 j xp yp nj xy j 15 8 john p d angelo where the nj are integers they are 0 when 2 j p and otherwise non zero in this range nj 0 when j is odd and nj 0 when j is even explicit formulas for the nj exist in fact they are closely related to the coefficients for fp 2 see d 3 to see what is going on we must consider the four possibilities for p modulo 4 we illustrate by listing the polynomials of degrees 4 5 6 7 as above we put z 1 2 x and z 2 2 y we obtain f 4 3 x y x 4 y 4 4 xy 2 x 2 y 2 16 4 f 5 4 x y x 5 y 5 5 xy 5 x 2 y 2 16 5 f 6 5 x y x 6 y 6 6 xy 9 x 2 y 2 2 x 3 y 3 16 6 f 7 6 x y x 7 y 7 7 xy 14 x 2 y 2 7 x 3 y 3 16 7 for p p 1 one can show the following when p 4 k or p 4 k 1 we have k 2 positive coefficients and k negative coefficients when p 4 k 2 or p 4 k 3 we have k 3 positive coefficients and k negative coefficients for q 2 in general one obtains some negative coefficients when expanding fp q and hence the target must be a non spherical hyperquadric the paper lww provides a method for determining the sign of the coefficients given a finite subgroup of u n the invariant polynomial is hermitian symmetric and hence its underlying matrix of coefficients is hermitian we let n denote the number of positive eigenvalues of this matrix and we let n denote the number of negative eigenvalues when is cyclic of order p we sometimes write n p instead of n but the reader should be warned that the numbers n and n depend upon and not just p the ratio rp n p n p n p is of some interest but it can be hard to compute we therefore consider its asymptotic behavior for the class of groups considered above theorem 4 1 holds it is a special case of a result to appear in the doctoral thesis g of grundmeier who has found the limit of rp for many classes of groups not necessarily cyclic whose order depends on p many different limiting values can occur here we state only the following simple version which applies to the three classes under consideration proposition 4 2 for the three classes of cyclic groups whose invariant polynomi als are given by 13 14 and 15 the limit of rp as p tends to infinity exists in the first two cases the limit is 1 when satisfies 15 the limit is 1 2 remark 4 1 for the class of groups p q the limit lq of rp exists and depends on q if one then lets q tend to infinity the resulting limit equals 3 4 thus the asymptotic result differs from the limit obtained by setting q p 1 at the start the subtlety of the situation is evident 5 metacyclic groups let cp denote a cyclic group of order p a group g is called metacyclic if there is an exact sequence of the form 1 cp g cq 1 invariant cr mappings 9 such groups are also described in terms of two generatorsa and b such that ap i bq i and ab bma for some m in this section we will consider metacyclic subgroups of u 2 defined as follows let be a primitive p th root of unity and let a be the following element of u 2 0 0 17 for these metacyclic groups we obtain in 23 a formula for the invariant polyno mials in terms of known invariant polynomials for cyclic groups we write c p p 1 for the cyclic subgroup of u 2 generated by a its invariant polynomial is c p p 1 1 p k 0 1 akz z 18 now return to the metacyclic group each group element of will be of the form bjak for appropriate exponents j k since b is unitary b b 1 we may therefore write bjakz w akz b jw 19 we use 19 in the product defining to obtain the following formula z z 1 p 1 k 0 q 1 j 0 1 bjakz z 1 p 1 k 0 q 1 j 0 1 akz b jz 20 notice that the term p 1 k 0 1 akz b jz 21 can be expressed in terms of the invariant polynomial for the cyclic group c p p 1 we have p 1 k 0 1 akz b jz 1 c p p 1 z b jz 22 and hence we obtain z z 1 q 1 j 0 1 c p p 1 z b jz 23 the invariance of follows from the definition but this property is not immedi ately evident from this polarized formula the other properties from theorem 1 1 are evident in this version of the formula we have 0 0 0 also z z 1 on the unit sphere because of the term when j 0 the degree in z is pq because we have a product of q terms each of degree p the simplest examples of metacyclic groups are the dihedral groups the di hedral group dp is the group of symmetries of a regular polygon of p sides the group dp has order 2 p it is generated by two elements a and b which satisfy the relations ap i b 2 i and ab bap 1 thus a corresponds to a rotation 10 john p d angelo and b corresponds to a reflection we may represent dp as a subgroup of u 2 by putting a 0 0 1 24 1 b 0 1 1 0 24 2 formula 23 for the invariant polynomial simplifies because the product in 23 has only two terms we obtain the following result proved earlier in d 2 theorem 5 1 the invariant polynomial for the above representation of dp satis fies the following formula z z fp p 1 z 1 2 z 2 2 fp p 1 z 2 z 1 z 1 z 2 fp p 1 z 1 2 z 2 2 fp p 1 z 2 z 1 z 1 z 2 25 6 an application failure of rigidity in this section we use the group invariant approach to construct the first examples of polynomial mappings of degree 2 p from q 2 2 p 1 to q n p 2 p 1 the key point of these examples is that the number of negative eigenvalues is preserved the mappings illustrate the failure of rigidity in the case where we keep the number of negative eigenvalues the same but we are allowed to increase the number of positive eigenvalues sufficiently the mappings arise from part of a general theory being developed dle 2 by the author and j lebl as mentioned in the introduction the additional assumption that the mapping preserves sides of the hyperquadric does force linearity in this context bh theorem 6 1 let 2 p 1 be an odd number with p 1 there is an integer n p and a holomorphic polynomial mapping gp of degree 2 p such that gp q 2 2 p 1 q n p 2 p 1 and gp maps to no hyperquadric with smaller numbers of positive or negative eigen values proof we begin with the group 2 p 2 we expand the formula given in 7 with p replaced by 2 p the result is a polynomial f 2 p 2 in the two variables x y with the following properties first the coefficients are positive except for the coefficient of y 2 p which is 1 second we have f 2 p 2 x y 1 on x y 1 third because of the group invariance only even powers of x arise we therefore can replace x by x and obtain a polynomial f x y such that f x y 1 on x y 1 and again all coefficients are positive except for the coefficient of y 2 p next replace y by y 1 y 2 we obtain a polynomial in x y 1 y 2 which has precisely 2 p 1 terms with negative coefficients these terms arise from expanding y 1 y 2 2 p all other terms have positive coefficients this polynomial takes the value 1 on the set x y 1 y 2 1 now replace x by x 1 x 2 p 1 we now have a polynomial w x y that is 1 on the set given by 2 p 1 1 xj 2 1 yj 1 invariant cr mappings 11 it has precisely 2 p 1 terms with negative coefficients there are many terms with positive coefficients suppose that the number is n p in order to get back to the holomorphic setting we put xj zj 2 for 1 j 2 p 1 and we put y 1 z 2 p 2 2 and y 2 z 2 p 3 2 we note that this idea an example of the moment map has been often used in this paper as well as in the author s work on proper mappings between balls see for example d 1 and dkr let gp z be the mapping determined up to a diagonal unitary matrix with n p j 1 gj z 2 2 p 1 j 1 gj z 2 w x y 26 each component of gp is determined by 26 up to a complex number of modulus 1 the degree of gp is the same as the degree of w we obtain all the claimed properties example 6 1 we write out everything explicitly when p 1 let c 2 the proof of theorem 6 1 yields the polynomial mapping g q 2 3 q 8 3 of degree 2 defined by g z z 21 z 2 2 z 2 3 cz 1 z 2 cz 1 z 3 cz 2 z 3 cz 4 cz 5 z 2 4 cz 4 z 5 z 2 5 27 notice that we used a semi colon after the first eight terms to highlight that g maps to q 8 3 summing the squared moduli of the first eight terms yields z 1 2 z 2 2 z 3 2 2 2 z 4 2 z 5 2 28 summing the squared moduli of the last three terms yields z 4 2 z 5 2 2 29 the set q 2 3 is given by z 4 2 z 5 2 1 z 1 2 z 2 2 z 3 2 on this set we obtain 1 when we subtract 29 from 28 bibliography ber baouendi m salah ebenfelt peter and rothschild linda preiss real submanifolds in complex space and
