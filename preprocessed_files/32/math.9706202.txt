abstract we show how to compute the bergman kernel func tions of some special domains in a simple way as an application of the explicit formulas we show that the bergman kernel functions of some convex domains for instance the domain in c 3 defined by the inequality z 1 z 2 z 3 1 have zeroes 1 introduction this note has two themes the first is that one can obtain useful formulas for the bergman kernel function in special cases with minimal computational effort the second is that one can find from the explicit formulas examples of simple convex domains whose bergman kernel functions have zeroes recently there has been renewed interest 6 9 8 13 in explicit formulas for the bergman kernel function especially in connection with the asymptotic behavior of the kernel near weakly pseudoconvex boundary points we will show how even without writing down an in finite series one can easily obtain an explicit formula for the bergman kernel function of for example the domain defined by the inequality z 1 2 p 1 zn 2 pn 1 where each zj is a vector in some c mj and each pj is a positive integer finding a simple class of domains whose bergman kernel functions are zero free has been an open problem ever since lu qi keng 12 raised the question in connection with the existence of bergman rep resentative coordinates the first author recently discovered 3 that the bergman kernel of a generic strongly pseudoconvex domain does have zeroes but the possibility was left open that all convex domains might have zero free bergman kernel functions we will show that the bergman kernel function of the domain in c 3 defined by the inequality z 1 z 2 z 3 1 does have zeroes consequently when n 3 there exists a smooth bounded strongly convex reinhardt domain in cn 1991 mathematics

boundary whose bergman kernel function has zeroes 2 explicit formulas for the bergman kernel the bergman kernel function k z w of a domain in cn is the reproducing kernel for the space of square integrable holomorphic func tions that is f z f w k z w dvw when f is a square integrable holomorphic function in we use three basic principles to obtain new bergman kernel functions from old ones the principles of deflation and inflation relate kernel functions of domains in different dimensions on the other hand the well known principle of folding relates kernel func tions of domains in the same dimension 2 1 deflation let be a bounded domain in cn defined by an in equality of the form z 1 where is a continuous nonnega tive function in a neighborhood of the closure of let k 1 denote the bergman kernel function of the bounded domain 1 in c n 2 de fined by the inequality z 1 2 p 2 2 q 1 where p and q are positive real numbers similarly let k 2 denote the bergman kernel function of the bounded domain 2 in c n 1 defined by the inequality z 2 p q 1 then k 2 z 0 w 0 2 p 1 q 1 p q 1 k 1 z 0 0 w 0 0 1 for example we will show in 3 1 that the bergman kernel function k z 1 z 2 w 1 w 2 of the non convex domain z 1 z 2 z 1 z 2 2 4 1 in c 2 has zeroes when z 2 w 2 0 taking n 1 and p q 2 in 1 shows that the bergman kernel function of the convex domain z 1 z 2 z 3 z 1 z 2 z 3 1 in c 3 also has zeroes the deflation identity 1 holds because both sides represent the unique holomorphic reproducing kernel function for the holomorphic functions on that are square integrable with respect to the weight function 1 p q consult 11 for a systematic study of weighted bergman projections to see this observe that a holomorphic function h on can be regarded as a holomorphic function on both 1 and 2 by extending it to be independent of the extra variables the reproducing property of the bergman kernel function on 2 implies that h z 2 h w k 2 z 0 w dvw 2 in the domain 2 the fiber over a point w in is a one dimensional disc of radius 1 w p q 2 integrating with respect to and using bergman kernel explicit formulas and zeroes 3 the mean value property of harmonic functions shows that 2 reduces to h z h w 1 w p q k 2 z 0 w 0 dvw the subaveraging property of k 2 z 0 w 0 2 implies thatk 2 z 0 w 0 is square integrable with respect to the weight 1 p q so the left hand side of 1 is the reproducing kernel for the holomorphic functions on that are square integrable with respect to the weight 1 p q the verification of the reproducing property of the right hand side of 1 differs only in that the fiber over a point in is two dimensional and one needs the volume of the region in c 2 defined by the inequality 1 2 p 2 2 q r a routine calculation in polar coordinates shows that this volume equals 2 p 1 q 1 rp q p q 1 which completes the proof of the deflation identity 1 2 2 inflation let be a bounded complete hartogs domain in cn 1 defined by an inequality of the form 2 z where c z cn and is a bounded positive continuous function on the interior of some bounded domain in cn due to the circular symmetry in the one dimensional variable there is a function l z w t such that the bergman kernel function k z w for can be written in the form l z w we can inflate into a domain in cn m defined by the inequality z 2 z where z is a vector variable in cm with euclidean norm z we will show that the bergman kernel function k z z w w of is given by the relation k z z w w 1 m 1 m 1 tm 1 l z w t t z w 3 where z w z 1 w 1 zmwm the motivation for this formula is the relation between the bergman kernel function 1 1 2 for the unit disc in c and the bergman kernel function for the unit ball in cm which is 1 m m 1 tm 1 1 1 t 2 t z w m m 1 1 z w m 1 4 for an application recall that when p is a positive real number the bergman kernel function of the domain z 2 2 p 1 in c 2 is 1 p 2 2 t 2 1 1 t p t zw 5 here is the only place in this note where implicitly an infinite se ries appears bergman 2 p 82 computed this kernel by summing a 4 harold p boas siqi fu and emil j straube series although he states that p is integral his computation is valid for arbitrary positive p inflating both variables shows that the bergman kernel function of the domain z 2 z 2 p 1 in cn m is 1 p n m n m tn 1 um 1 1 1 t p u t z w u z w 6 this kernel function was first computed in a somewhat different form by chalmers 4 theorem 1 1 subsequently d angelo used a different method to sum the orthonormal series to compute this kernel form 1 in 5 and for general m in 6 his formulas are written as finite sums rather than as derivatives we prove the inflation formula 3 by verifying the reproducing prop erty since is invariant under unitary transformations of cm it suf fices to verify 3 when z z 1 0 0 in which case we can rewrite m 1 tm 1 l z w t t z w 1 zm 11 m 1 w m 1 1 l z w z 1 w 1 7 if h is a square integrable holomorphic function on then we find by using the mean value property in the m 1 variables w 2 wm that 1 m 1 h w w m 1 tm 1 l z w t t z 1 w 1 dvw w 1 m 1 zm 11 h w w 1 w w 1 2 m 1 m 1 w m 1 1 l z w z 1 w 1 dvw w 1 observe that f z 7 1 z f z is continuous in l 2 on holomor phic functions in the unit disc this follows by integrating in polar coordinates so the above calculation implies that the kernel 7 is square integrable in approximating h w w 1 and l z w z 1 w 1 by polynomials in w 1 and w 1 respectively shows that no boundary terms arise when we integrate by parts in the w 1 variable m 1 times so the right hand side of the preceding formula reduces to 1 zm 11 h w w 1 w m 1 1 l z w z 1 w 1 dvw w 1 h z z 1 where the final equality follows from the reproducing property of the bergman kernel function on thus the kernel given by 3 does reproduce holomorphic functions on bergman kernel explicit formulas and zeroes 5 2 3 folding the third method is a well known useful tool to estab lish explicit formulas for the bergman kernel jarnicki and pflug 10 p 176 as in paragraph 2 2 let be a bounded complete hartogs domain in cn 1 defined by an inequality of the form 2 z when p is a positive integer z 7 z p is a proper holomorphic mapping of onto the domain p in c n 1 defined by the inequality 2 p z bell s transformation rule 1 for the bergman kernel function under proper mappings implies that when 6 0 the bergman kernel k for is related to the bergman kernel kp for p via p 2 p 1 kp z p w p p j 1 jk z w j where is a primitive pth root of unity for example we can repeatedly fold formula 6 with m 1 to see that when p 1 pn are positive integers and p is any positive real number the domain in cn 1 defined by the inequality z 1 2 p 1 zn 2 pn zn 1 2 p 1 has bergman kernel k given by the finite sum 8 k z p 1 1 z pn n zn 1 w p 1 1 w pn n wn 1 1 p n 1 n k 1 1 p 2 k zkw k pk 1 p 1 j 1 1 pn jn 1 n 1 tn 1 j 1 1 jn n 1 t p zn 1 w n 1 t n 1 z w j where each j is a primitive pjth root of unity francsics and hanges 9 theorem 3 computed this kernel by summing an infinite series when p is also an integer this kernel can be obtained by folding the simpler formula 4 for the ball compare 10 exercise 6 5 this special case was first computed by zinov ev 15 via series methods it should be evident how to inflate 8 via 3 to obtain the bergman kernel function for the domain defined by the inequality z 1 2 p 1 zn 2 pn zn 1 2 p 1 where each zj is a vector in some c mj re peated foldings and inflations easily give the bergman kernel functions of still more general domains with defining functions like z 1 2 p 1 z 2 2 p 2 2 p z 3 2 p 3 1 the only difficulty in writing the formulas being the choice of a suitable notation compare 7 6 2 3 zeroes of the bergman kernel we now deduce from the explicit formulas some consequences about when the bergman kernel function has zeroes in particular the kernel 6 harold p boas siqi fu and emil j straube function has zeroes in some simple convex domains a fact previously unknown 3 1 two dimensional domains to find the bergman kernel func tionkp for the domain p in c 2 defined by the inequality z 1 z 2 2 p 1 we fold bergman s formula 5 or equivalently take n 1 and p 1 2 in 8 leaving p as an arbitrary positive real number setting x z 1 w 1 and y z 2 w 2 we have kp z 2 1 z 2 w 2 1 w 2 1 4 p 2 x 2 x 2 1 1 x p y 1 1 x p y 9 when x 6 0 we will show that the bergman kernel function kp of p has zeroes when p 2 while the bergman kernel function k 2 of 2 has no zeroes on the interior of the domain setting y 0 in 9 we see that kp z 2 1 0 w 2 1 0 0 if and only if x 6 0 and 1 x p 2 1 x p 2 when y 0 the point x runs over the unit disc since t 7 1 t 1 t maps the unit disc bijectively to the right half plane it follows that the equation 1 x 1 x p 2 1 has a non zero solution in the unit disc if and only if p 2 hence for p 2 the bergman kernel function kp has zeroes when z 2 0 taking the limit in 9 as x 0 we find after a routine calculation that kp 0 z 2 0 w 2 1 2 2 y 2 p 2 3 p 2 4 y p 2 1 p 2 3 p 2 1 y 4 this expression is real valued for real values of y positive for y 0 and equal to p 2 4 2 at y 1 so if p 2 then there is a zero for y in the unit disc hence for p 2 the bergman kernel kp has zeroes also when z 1 0 setting p 2 in 9 we find after some routine algebra that k 2 z 1 z 2 w 1 w 2 2 2 3 1 x y 1 x y 2 8 xy 1 x y 2 4 xy 3 where x z 1 w 1 and y z 2 w 2 as before compare 10 example 6 1 9 we aim to show that this expression has no zeroes when x and y are complex numbers such that x y 1 this constraint implies that 4 x y 1 x y 2 so the numerator of the expression exceeds twice 3 1 x y 1 x y 2 2 1 x y 2 3 1 x y 2 1 x y 2 1 x y 2 1 x y 2 bergman kernel explicit formulas and zeroes 7 consequently k 2 z 1 z 2 w 1 w 2 has no zeroes on the interior of the domain however there are zeroes on the boundary for instance k 2 1 0 1 0 0 notice that when p 2 the case in which we have shown that the bergman kernel kp has zeroes the domain p is not convex in higher dimensions the situation changes 3 2 higher dimensional domains using the deflation identity 1 we can identify many convex domains in higher dimensions whose bergman kernel functions have zeroes for example the bergman kernel function of the convex domain in cn defined by the inequal ity z 1 z 2 zn 1 has zeroes if and only if the dimension n 3 indeed we have checked that this bergman kernel is zero free when n 2 if n 3 on the other hand then we find by 1 that the restriction of the kernel to the subspace where z 2 zn 0 equals a positive constant times k 2 n 2 z 1 0 w 1 0 and we saw in 3 1 that this kernel has zeroes when 2 n 2 2 as another example we show that the bergman kernel function k of the convex domain in cn defined by the inequality z 1 z 2 2 z 3 2 zn 2 1 has zeroes if and only if the dimension n 4 using deflation as in the preceding paragraph shows that the kernel has zeroes when n 4 but does not show that the kernel is zero free when n 3 accordingly we examine the explicit formula obtained by folding the kernel for the ball k z 21 z 2 zn w 2 1 w 2 wn n n 1 4 z 1 w 1 1 1 z w n 1 1 1 z w n 1 the same argument as in 3 1 that t 7 1 t 1 t maps the unit disc bijectively to the right half plane shows that this kernel function has zeroes in the interior of the domain if and only if n 1 4 by using the tools indicated in 2 the reader can easily produce more examples of convex domains whose bergman kernel functions have zeroes we have given two examples to illustrate the usefulness of the techniques the examples just given of convex domains whose bergman kernel functions have zeroes are nonsmooth domains we can exhaust such domains by sequences of smooth strongly convex domains with real analytic boundaries by ramadanov s theorem 14 the bergman ker nels of the approximating domains converge uniformly on compact sets to the bergman kernel of the limit domain by hurwitz s theorem the bergman kernel functions of the approximating strongly convex 8 harold p boas siqi fu and emil j straube domains cannot all be zero free consequently when n 3 there exist smooth bounded strongly convex domains in cn even with real analytic boundary whose bergman kernel functions have zeroes 4 remarks 1 the domains in cn whose bergman kernels we have shown to have zeroes are convex only when n 3 it would be interesting to find a bounded convex domain in dimension n 2 whose bergman kernel function has zeroes 2 it would be interesting to characterize the set of positive real numbers p 1 p 2 pn for which the bergman kernel function of the domain in cn defined by the inequality z 1 2 p 1 z 2 2 p 2 zn 2 pn 1 is zero free note added 23 june 1997 shortly after we emailed p pflug about our results he and e h youssfi were able to find zeroes of the bergman kernels of
