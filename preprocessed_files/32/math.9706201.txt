and sufficient conditions for a system z i zipi z pi a polynomial to have only entire analytic functions as solutions 1 preliminaries we will need the following elementary facts from nevanlinna theory for any entire function of one complex variable f z we set m r f 1 2 r z r log f z dz n r f f a log r a and t r f m r f n r f in the definition of n the sum is taken over all poles a of f with regard to multiplicity the function t r f is called the nevanlinna characteristic of f the following properties are easily verified t r f 1 f 2 t r f 1 t r f 2 o 1 t r f 1 f 2 t r f 1 t r f 2 t r fd dt r f 1 here and in the sequel the estimates o g and o g are as r the first fundamental theorem of nevanlinna theory says that t r 1 f t r f o 1 we also have the lemma of the logarithmic derivative lld m r f f oexcl t r f here oexcl means that the estimate holds outside a set of finite measure we also use the corresponding notation oexcl from lld and the preceding inequalities it follows that m r f k 1 oexcl 1 t r f 2 m r f k f oexcl t r f 3 1991 mathematics subject classification 34 a 20 30 d 35 supported by a grant from stint 1 http arxiv org abs math 9706201 v 1 2 erik anderse n for all positive integers k 2 borel s theorem we need a version of a theorem named after borel which is classical but which is proved here since i have not found a good reference to it we call an entire holomorphic function a unit if it has no zeros theorem 1 let f be an entire function and u 1 u 2 un be units satis fying ui f 4 then one of the following cases holds 1 t r ui oexcl t r f 1 for all i 2 some subsum i i ui 0 proof the proof is by induction if n 1 then case 1 holds automatically so there is nothing to prove we assume that the theorem holds for sums with less than n terms if we differentiate 4 we get u j i ui ui f j for j 0 n 1 this is a linear system for ui two cases are possible 1 det u j i ui 6 0 then we can solve for ui and get t r ui o t r f j o t r u j i ui o 1 o t r f i oexcl t r ui o 1 by lld we therefore have case 1 2 det u j i ui 0 this means that thewronskianw ui det u j i 0 the theory of ordinary differential equations now says there are con stants ci such that ciui 0 5 we choose the shortest possible such sum that is the sum with the smallest number of non zero ci possibly after a reordering and a scal ing we may assume that c 1 1 so that u 1 i 1 ciui division by u 1 gives i 1 ciui u 1 1 6 we set vi ciui u 1 and apply the theorem to the expression 6 which has less than n terms there are two cases ordinary differential equations with only entire solutions 3 a t vi r oexcl t 1 r 1 oexcl 1 for all i then all vi are constant and ui aiu 1 for some ai the sum 4 now becomes ai 1 u 1 f if ai 1 0 then f 0 and we have case 2 otherwise u 1 is proportional to f and then all ui are also proportional to f we then have case 1 b i i vi 0 for some set i then i i ciui 0 and this sum is shorter than 5 this is a contradiction 3 differential equations theorem 2 let pi be laurent polynomials and z i zipi z zi 0 ci 1 i n 7 be an ordinary differential equation such that for all c in some open set all components of the solutions are units then p z n 1 k 1 uk k m k u 0 8 here uk c n m k c z z 1 k is defined by m n z and m k 1 i m k j a k ij for k n 2 9 where a k are k 1 k matrices satisfying a k a n uk 0 and k are laurent polynomials conversely any system of the form 8 has only entire solutions and all components are either units or identically zero the proof needs a lemma we write p z p 1 z pn z p z p z and p p 1 p n we let dg denote g 1 g 1 g n gn let s be the set of meromorphic functions satisfying t r f oexcl t r z 1 t r zn 1 lemma 1 let m be the multiplicative module generated by of n z p i 6 0 for some i then dimm n proof choose c so that a p ic 6 0 for all non zero subpolynomials and all indices i and so that all components of the solution are units let z t be the solution with z 0 c apply borel s theorem to p iz z i zi because of our choice of initial condition case 2 does not hold therefore n s it follows from the rules 1 that m s assume that the dimension of m is n then for each i there is di such that z di m s again by 1 zi s for each i this is impossible and therefore the dimension is less than n proof of theorem 2 the proof is by induction the theorem holds if n 1 so we assume that it holds for systems with smaller number of variables we first prove the necessity of 8 assume that 7 has only entire solutions by lemma 1 we can write p z f m where m m 1 ml and mi z aij j and l n we may assume that a aij has full rank since 4 erik anderse n we can otherwise drop some variables mi if l n 1 we can complete a to an n 1 n matrix of full rank so we assume that l n 1 set mi z aij j then dz p z f m and logarithmic differentiation gives dm af m by induction af m n 2 k 1 vk k m k v 0 where m k are given by 9 for k n 1 2 and a k a n 1 vk 0 since a is surjective vk auk for some uk so f m n 2 k 1 vk k m k v 0 ker a since this kernel is one dimensional we have f m un 1 n 1 m n 2 k 1 uk k m k u 0 for some un 1 ker a c n and some laurent polynomial n 1 if we set m n 1 m and a n 1 a the first half of the theorem is proved if the system is of form 8 then we get as above that dm a n n 1 k 1 uk k m k u 0 n 2 k 1 a n uk k m k a n u 0 since a n un 0 by assumption by induction this system has only entire solutions m t an integration of z i zi fi m t now proves the rest of the theorem remark although the form 8 9 is complicated the proof gives an extremely simple recursive algorithm to determine if all solutions to a system are entire first compute the multiplicative span of all z such that p i 6 0 for some i if this is the whole space the system does have non entire solutions otherwise let mi be a basis for this space and express p z f m in terms of this basis differentiate logarithmically to get a new equation dm af m with notations as in the theorem the original system has only entire solutions if and only if this new system has remark if the polynomials pi are genuine polynomials it is immediately clear that all components of any solution are either zero free or identically zero corollary 1 all complete polynomial vector fields on c n are of the form 7 with p satisfying 8 ordinary differential equations with only entire solutions 5 corollary 2 all complete polynomial vector fields on c n preserve the volume form dzi zi proof the proof is again by induction we compute d dt dzi zi dz i zi z i dzi z 2 i d zipi z zi zipi z dzi z 2 i d pi z this shows in particular that the result holds for n 1 also we compute d dt i dzi zi i dz 1 z 1 d dt dzi zi dzn zn i zi pi zi i dzi zi we use the notation of the proof of the theorem and in particular the result that p z f m anddm af m we have to prove that zi pi zi z 0 so we compute i zi fi zi i zi j fi mj mj zi i zi j fi mj mj aji zi i j fi mj mjaji j af j mj mj 10 the last expression is 0 by induction and the corollary is proved department
