function defined on the unit ball of a complex banach space 1 introduction given a complex banach space x of infinite dimension we recall the following runge approximation problems 1 given r 0 1 0 and f a holomorphic function on the open unit ball of x is there an entire function h satisfying f h on the open ball of radius r centered at the origin see for instance 8 2 is there r 0 1 such that for any 0 and any holomorphic function f on the open unit ball of x there exists a entire function h satisfying f h on the open ball of radius r centered at the origin see for instance 13 we note that problem 2 is clearly independent of the choice of an equivalent norm defining the topology of x while problem 1 is the analogous version of what is known to be true when x is finite dimensional the main difficulty here is due to riesz theorem asserting that the unit ball is not relatively compact when dimx in other words we may possibly deal with holomorphic functions defined on the unit ball that are not bounded on smaller balls the following example shows that this is indeed the case example 1 1 consider on the banach space l 1 n z n c z j 1 z j the function given by f z j 1 2 jz j j and let ek be defined by ek j jk one can check that f is holomorphic on the unit ball and since f 2 3 ek 2 k 2 3 k f is unbounded on b 0 2 3 on the other hand since unbounded holomorphic functions on the unit ball may occur we can not replace as in the finite dimensional case h entire holomorphic function by h holomorphic polynomial in the setting of the runge approximation problems indeed holomorphic polynomials are bounded on the unit ball the first result in the direction of problem 1 is due to l lempert he proves the following theorem for the banach space l 1 z c z z where is any set analyse complexe complex analysis the author was partially supported by swiss nsf grant 2100 063464 00 1 1 http arxiv org abs 1404 1726 v 1 2 f meylan theorem 1 2 8 let x be a locally convex space and m be a stein manifold let k m be a compact set that is convex with respect to the set of holomorphic functions on m and v m be an open neighborhood of k define m z v l 1 z r m m z z r m where r and r are positive continuous functions on v satisfying r r then for every seminorm for every 0 for every x valued holomorphic map f defined on there exists an x valued holomorphic map g defined on m l 1 such that f g on k one of lempert s motivations to get interested into the runge approximation problems has been for instance the solvability of the equation in banach spaces see 9 10 17 in particular he obtains the following theorem theorem 1 3 10 if l 1 n is pseudoconvex and f c 0 1 is a closed locally lipschitz continuous 0 1 form then the equation u f has a solution u c 1 when solving the problem when is the ball centered at 0 of radius r in 9 he shows first that u f is solvable on balls centered at 0 of radius r r and then constructs a global solution on the ball centered at 0 of radius r using the runge approximation problem 1 2 preliminaries let x be a complex banach space for r 0 we use b 0 r to denote the ball of radius r recall that a function f u x c where u is an open subset of x is holomorphic if f is continuous on u and f u x 1 is holomorphic in the classical sense as a function of several complex variables for each finite dimensional subspace x 1 of x see 2 we note that unlike the finite dimensional case the continuity of f is not automatic as it is shown in the following example example 2 1 let ei be an algebraic basis of x with ei 1 and let f x c be the linear form satisfying f ei i since f is not bounded f is not holomorphic we now recall the definition of a holomorphic polynomial definition 2 2 let n x xn be the mapping defined by n x x x a n homogeneous holomorphic polynomial p x c is the composition of n with any continuous n linear map l that is p l n a holomorphic polynomial is a finite sum of homogeneous holomorphic polynomials definition 2 3 let h be a holomorphic function on b 0 r r 0 we say that h is n homogeneous if h x nh x for c 1 for the convenience of the reader we give the proof of the next propositions proposition 2 4 let fn b 0 r c be holomorphic functions such that limn fn f uniformly on compact subsets of b 0 r then f is holomorphic on b 0 r proof since f is clearly holomorphic when restricted to finite dimensional subspaces of x we only have to show the continuity of f let zn be a sequence in x with limn zn z x by assumption given 0 there exists on the compact subset zn z m depending only on such that 2 1 f z fm z fm zn f zn 2 3 approximation of holomorphic functions in banach spaces 3 hence there exists n 0 such that for n n 2 2 f z f zn f z fm z fm z fm zn fm zn f zn proposition 2 5 let h b 0 r c be a n homogeneous holomorphic function then h is an entire function that is a holomorphic function defined on x proof for z x we may write z 1 z 1 z 1 b 0 r we define h z 1 nh z 1 and claim that it is a well defined entire function indeed if z has another representation z 2 z 2 z 2 b 0 r then without loss of generality we will have z 1 2 1 z 2 2 1 1 which implies h z 1 h 2 1 z 2 proposition 2 6 let h x c be a n homogeneous holomorphic function then h is a n homogeneous holomorphic polynomial more precisely there is a unique symetric continuous n linear map l such that h l n proof if l exists it has to satisfy 2 3 h z 1 x 1 znxn l zjxj zjxj z 1 nl x 1 x 1 n z 1 z 2 znl x 1 xn znnl xn xn hence we have the integral formula 2 4 l x 1 xn 1 n 2 i n z 1 1 zn n h z 1 x 1 znxn z 1 2 zn 2 dz 1 dzn using 2 4 we obtain the uniqueness for the existence we use 2 4 as a definition and show that l is a symetric n linear map using a linear change of variables the continuity of l beeing obtained by using j small enough 3 bounded holomorphic functions we start this section by recalling the following definition definition 3 1 let f b 0 1 c be a holomorphic function we define fn z as 3 1 fn z 2 0 f e 2 itz e 2 intdt lemma 3 2 let f b 0 1 c be a holomorphic function then fn defined by 3 1 is a n homogeneous holomorphic polynomial proof we first notice that fn is a holomorphic fonction on the unit ball that is n homogeneous along any finite dimensional subspace we conclude then using proposition 2 6 that fn is a n homogeneous holomorphic polynomial lemma 3 3 let f b 0 1 c be a holomorphic function then 3 2 f z n 1 fn z proof the proof is achieved by restricting to finite dimensional subspaces of x 4 f meylan the following theorem shows that uniform approximation by holomorphic polynomials is possible for bounded holomorphic functions for the convenience of the reader we give the proof theorem 3 4 let f b 0 1 c be a holomorphic function that is bounded on smaller balls b 0 r 0 r 1 then given 0 there exists a holomorphic polynomial h satisfying f h on b 0 r proof we claim that for 0 1 we have 3 3 lim n fn b 0 1 1 n 1 indeed since f is bounded on b 0 1 we have m fn z n fn z hence fn z 1 n m 1 n which implies limn fn b 0 1 1 n 1 choosing 1 satisfying 1 we obtain 3 3 we then consider for r 1 the ball b 0 r rb 0 1 using 3 3 we obtain that there exists 1 such that rn fn b 0 1 n for n large enough using lemma 3 3 we then conclude that f z n 1 fn z uniformly on b 0 r the proof of the proposition is achieved using lemma 3 2 4 a counterexample in this section we discuss the counterexample given by lempert in 14 we start with the following definition definition 4 1 a set s is called a bounding set if f s for every entire function in 1 dineen shows that l admits non compact closed bounding subsets more precisely he shows that any entire function on l is bounded on the set s en where en j jn lempert considers a sequence of norms on l all equivalent to the sup norm more precisely he defines 4 1 z k 2 k supj 1 j 2 jk z j 1 z j 2 z jk z n c l then he considers on l z k the following holomorphic function on the unit ball 4 2 f z j 1 jz j j that is unbounded on the set s en this shows using dineen s result that the answer to problem 1 and problem 2 is negative on l z k we refer the interested reader to 14 for the details 5 the general case in the light of the counterexample given by lempert we may ask the following question do runge approximations 1 and 2 hold in any separable banach space of particular interest is the space c 0 1 since every separable banach space is isometric to a subspace of c 0 1 the runge approximations are still open for this space as well as for the banach space l 1 0 1 as said in the introduction the obstruction to runge approximations is riesz theorem therefore one needs to look for good compact subsets that replace the unit ball the following lemma gives some understanding of what kind of sufficient conditions is needed to obtain a positive answer to problem 1 and problem 2 approximation of holomorphic functions in banach spaces 5 lemma 5 1 3 let tn be a uniformly bounded sequence of linear operators in x if limn tnx x for every x x then this limit exists uniformly on any compact set conversely if limn tnx x uniformly for x in a bounded set k and if in addition tnk is relatively compact for each n then k relatively is compact we recall the following definitions definition 5 2 a series n 1 xn is said to converge unconditionally if n 1 x n converges for every permutation of the integers definition 5 3 let x be a complex banach space a sequence xn of closed subspaces of x is called a schauder decomposition of x if every x x has a unique representation of the form x n 1 xn with xn x the schauder decomposition is unconditional if for every x x the series n 1 xn which represents x converges unconditionally remark 5 4 18 a decomposition xn of a banach space x is a schauder decomposition of x if and only if the projections pj defined by 5 1 pj n 1 xn j n 1 xn are continuous moreover pj is a uniformly bounded sequence of linear operators in x example 5 5 lp n z n c z j 1 z j p 1 p admits an unconditional schauder basis i e dimxn 1 example 5 6 let x be the space of compact operators on l 2 n which have a triangular representing matrix with respect to en where en j jn let xn be the subspace of x defined as xn t x tej 0 j 6 n then xn is an unconditional schauder decomposition of x with dimxn in this case we say that x has a ufdd unconditional finite dimensional decomposition moreover by a result of gordon and lewis x does not have an unconditional schauder basis see 4 16 example 5 7 it is well known that the space of compact operators on l 2 n has an unconditional schauder decomposition into ufdd but has no ufdd itself see 7 assume now that x admits an unconditional schauder decomposition xn n 1 let x n 1 xn xn xn be the unique representation of x it is known that for every sequence of complex numbers n n 1 n n the operator m defined by m n 1 xn n 1 nxn is a bounded linear operator the finite constant sup m is called the unconditional constant of the decomposition see 16 and 18 for details it is clear that one can always define on x an equivalent norm 1 so that the unconditional constant becomes 1 take x 1 sup m x in other words we have 5 2 n 1 nxn 1 n 1 xn 1 n 1 n n 6 f meylan using lemma 5 1 and 5 2 one proves proposition 5 8 let x be a complex banach space admitting an unconditional schauder decomposition xn with unconditional constant one then the following holds 1 m b 0 r is relatively compact in b 0 r for any sequence of complex numbers n n 1 which converges to 0 if and only if dimxn for any n 2 for any compact k b 0 r there exists a sequence of complex numbers n n 1 which converges to 0 and a compact l b 0 r so that m l k proof we note that pj m b 0 r is relatively compact if and only if dimxn for any n the rest of the proof is similar to the one of proposition 1 2 in 11 remark 5 9 the sets m b 0 r in proposition 5 8 will play the role of good relatively compact sets that replace the unit ball in the case of a space admitting a ufdd 6 the case of banach spaces admitting a ufdd in the light of the proof of theorem 3 4 remark 5 9 leads to the following definitions that appear in 8 11 5 and 13 let x be a complex banach space admitting an unconditional schauder decomposition xn with unconditional constant one let z x be given by its unique representation z n 1 zn with zn xn for every n for m n one defines 6 1 t m e 2 it t tn tn r tn 0 for n m and 6 2 k m k kn kn n 0 kn 0 for n m m n 1 kn m definition 6 1 let f be a holomorphic function on b 0 r for k k m and e 2 is t m we define fk z as 6 3 fk z t m f me 2 isz e 2 ik sds where ds is the normalized haar measure on t m note that fk is homogeneous of degree kn in zn definition 6 2 the formal series associated to f given by 6 4 m 0 k k m fm k z is called the josefson series we have the following proposition proposition 6 3 13 let x be a complex banach space admitting an unconditional schauder decom position xn with unconditional constant one then the josefson series converges to f uniformly on compact sets of b 0 r if dimxn for any n approximation of holomorphic functions in banach spaces 7 remark 6 4 in proposition 6 3 the proof of the uniform convergence on compact sets relies on the fact that the sets m b 0 r are compact it would be interesting to know if it holds without the assumption on the dimension of each xn making use of the josefson series one can show that problem 2 holds in spaces admitting an uncon ditional schauder decomposition xn with dimxn for any n more precisely we have theorem 6 5 13 let x be a complex banach space admitting an unconditional schauder decomposition xn with dimxn for any n then there exists an equivalent norm on x for which the runge approximation problem 1 holds we may ask the following question does the runge approximation problem 2 hold in complex banach spaces admitting an uncon ditional schauder decomposition into ufdd note that the model case of such a space is given by example 5 7 remark 6 6 it is known that the spaces c 0 1 and l 1 0 1 do not admit any unconditional schauder decomposition into ufdd indeed lindenstrauss and pelczynski in 15 showed that if xn is an uncon ditional schauder decomposition of c 0 1 then at least one xn c 0 1 which is impossible 18 n j kalton in 6 showed that the same holds for l 1 0 1 references 1 dineen s bounding subsets of a banach space math ann 192
