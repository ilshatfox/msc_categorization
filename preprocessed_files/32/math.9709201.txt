group siqi fu and bun wong 1 introduction in this paper we continue our investigation of domains with non compact automorphism groups in fw we shall prove the following main theorem if d is a simply connected domain in c 2 with generic piecewise smooth levi flat boundary and non compact automorphism group then d is biholomorphic to the bidisc the boundary bd of a bounded domain d in cn is called piecewise smooth if there exists a neighborhood u of d and k c u 1 k m such that d q u k q 0 1 k m and d k 1 d kl 6 0 on l j 1 skj for any distinct k 1 kl 1 m where sj q u j q 0 it is called generic piecewise smooth if k 1 kl 6 0 on lj 1 skj the boundary bd is called generic piecewise smooth levi flat if each sj is in additional levi flat see section 3 we will call j 1 j m a defining system of d and each sj a defining hypersurface of d when d is convex the above result was obtained by k t kim kim 1 see w 2 for related results kim s proof uses a refine version of the rescaling method introduced by frankel fra it was proved by pinchuk p that a homogeneous bounded domain with piecewise smooth boundary is biholomorphic to a product of balls note that the non compact condition in the above theorem is weaker than the homogeneous condition in pinchuk s result in the latter case one can choose a special boundary accumulation point that has properties similar to those possessed by a strictly pseudoconvex boundary point see kod 1 2 and cs for results along this line we remark that the simply connected condition on d cannot be dropped for example the product of a disc and an annulus has generic piecewise smooth levi flat boundary and non compact automorphism group however it is not biholomorphic to the bidisc for motivation and background on the subject we refer readers

siqi fu and bun wong acknowledgment the first author thanks professors h boas s krantz and e straube for their supports he is especially thankful to professor e straube for stimulating con versations on the subject 2 preliminaries let d be a bounded domain in cn let be the unit disc and n the unit n polydisc let h d 1 d 2 be the family of holomorphic mappings from d 1 to d 2 let t d be the holomorphic tangent bundle of d we will identify t d with d cn the kobayashi royden metric fkd t d r 0 is defined by fkd z v inf 1 there exits f h d with f 0 z f 0 v 0 for z v t d for f z f 1 z 1 zn

sup det f z 2 f h d n f z 0 we list some well known properties of the kobayashi royden metric and the invariant measures lemma 2 1 let d d 1 and d 2 be bounded domains in c n 1 if f h d 1 d 2 then f k d 1 p v fkd 2 f p f p v for p v t d 1 2 if f h d 1 d 2 then md 1 z md 2 f z det f z 2 where md is either of the invariant measures 3 let d 1 d 2 be a covering mapping then f k d 1 z v fkd 2 z v and m e d 1 z med 2 z det z 2 4 med z m c d z for all z d if m e d z 0 m c d z 0 for some z 0 d then d is biholomorphic to n for more information on invariant metrics and measures we refer readers to kob kr gw 1 2 and jp let re i r 0 be the cone with vertex at the origin and angles between its edges and the negative re z axis let a r be the disc with center a and radius r let 0 and lemma 2 2 let 1 and 2 be two numbers such that 0 1 2 let zj rje i j 1 j 1 be a sequence in 1 suppose that zj 0 and j 1 then for any positive numbers 1 and 2 non compact automorphism groups 3 lim j m 1 1 zj m 2 2 zj 2 cos 2 2 1 cos 2 1 2 where m is either of the invariant measures proof note that in this case the two invariant measures are identical in fact they are the square of the poincare metric in the unit direction using the conformal mapping z 7 1 i z 2 1 i z 2 2 that maps onto the upper half plane and the explicit formula for poincare metric of the upper half plane one obtains by straight forward but tedious calculations that for z rei with m z 1 cos 2 2 2 1 r 2 r 2 sin 2 1 r 2 r 2 sin 2 4 r 1 r 2 the lemma then follows from the above formula 3 levi flat hypersurfaces let s be a smooth hypersurface in cn let be a defining function for s i e there exists a neighborhood u of s such that c u s z u z 0 and d z 6 0 on s the hypersurface s is called pseudoconvex if the levi form n j k 1 2 zj z k z xjx k 0 for all z s and x cn with n j 1 zj z xj 0 it is called levi flat if the sign in the above inequality is replaced by the sign it is well known that a levi flat hypersurface is locally foliated by complex manifolds of codimension 1 cf fre in particular if s is a levi flat hypersurface in c 2 and p s then there exists a neighborhood u of p and a diffeomorphism gt g t 1 1 s u such that gt is holomorphic in each open riemann surface gt is a leaf of the foliation the following lemma shows that if s contains an affine disc then one can piece together the local foliations to obtain a foliation of s in a neighborhood of any smaller disc of the given disc since we cannot find a reference for such a result we provide the details of the proof which is inspired in part by the work of barrett and forn ss baf lemma 3 1 let m 0 and let s be a levi flat hypersurface containing m then for any with 0 1 there exists a neighborhood n of 0 and a diffeomorphism 4 siqi fu and bun wong t from 1 1 onto s n such that t t where t is holomorphic in and 0 0 for proof it follows from theorem 8 in df see lemma 3 3 below that after a change of coordinate system in a neighborhood of m the real normal of s is constant on m assume that the normal direction is the positive real rew direction then s is given in a neighborhood of 0 by 2 1 rew r z z imw 0 where r z z imw c imw 2 for some constant c 0 we now cover the closure of by finitely many discs zj rj 0 j m so that s has a foliation by open riemann surfaces in a neighborhood uj of zj 2 rj 0 without loss of generality we assume that z 0 r 0 contains the origin let g t g 1 t g 2 t 1 1 s u 0 be a foliation of s u 0 after reparametrization we may assume that g 0 0 0 since g 0 s it follows from 2 1 that re g 2 0 c im g 2 0 2 thus g 2 0 0 and g 1 0 is one to one for let a 0 1 be sufficiently closed to 1 such that z 0 r 0 g 1 0 a it is easy to see from rouche s theorem that g 1 t g 1 t is one to one on a for sufficiently small t let 0 t 0 t 0 0 z 0 r 0 s where 0 t g 2 t g 1 t 1 and 0 is a sufficiently small positive constant after a reparametrization in t we may assume that 0 t 0 0 r 0 0 t it it is clear that 0 t gives a foliation of s in a neighborhood of z 0 r 0 0 we now show how to extend 0 t to obtain a foliation of s in a neighborhood of 0 suppose that z 0 r 0 z 1 r 1 6 let p z 0 r 0 z 1 r 1 let 1 t 1 t 1 1 z 1 r 1 s be defined as in the previous paragraph such that 1 t p p 0 t p here 1 is a sufficiently small constant it follows from the uniqueness of the foliation that 0 t 1 t for t 0 0 1 1 and z 0 r 0 z 1 r 1 piecing together the foliations of s in a neighborhood of zj rj 0 in this manner we obtain a smooth foliation of s in a neighborhood of in a form of t t s where t 0 0 r 0 0 t it and 0 is a sufficiently small constant after a reparametrization in t we may assume that 1 lemma 3 2 let d be a bounded domain in c 2 with piecewise smooth levi flat boundary let s be one of the defining hypersurfaces of d let d be a subdomain of d and let g d bd be a holomorphic map if g d s 6 then g d s proof we assume that g is a non constant map let m g d s then m is a closed subset of g d we now prove that it is also an open subset let p m and p g q for some q d after a change of coordinate system we may assume that p 0 0 the leaf of s through p is locally parameterized by 7 0 and s is locally defined by z w rew imw r z z imw non compact automorphism groups 5 where r z z imw o z imw write g g 1 g 2 it follows from g 1 g 2 0 that re g 2 z w im g 2 z w for z w sufficiently closed to q since g 2 q 0 it follows from the open mapping property of non constant holomorphic functions that g 2 is identically zero near q since m contains the set g 1 z w 0 for all z w near q it is also an open subset of g d therefore g d m s since the above mentioned result of diederich and forn ss df theorem 8 plays an important role in this paper we reformulate it here for reader s convenience theorem 3 3 diederich forn ss let d be a bounded domain in c 2 such that m 0 bd assume that bd is smooth and pseudoconvex in a neighborhood of m with a local defining function r r z w assume further that the outward normal direction of bd at the origin is the positive rew axis let v z arg r w z 0 then v z defines a harmonic function on furthermore if u z is a harmonic conjugate of v z and h z exp u z iv z then the outward normal of bd is constant on m in the new coordinates z w defined by z z and w wh z 4 proof of the main theorem part i for the rest of the paper we will use d to denote a simply connected domain in c 2 with generic piecewise smooth levi flat boundary and non compact automorphism group aut d let gk aut d suppose that gk q bd as k for some q d after passing to a subsequence we may assume that gk g local uniformly on d it follows from cartan s theorem cf na 1 pp 78 that g d bd let s bd j 6 k sj sk be the set of singular boundary points let r bd s be the set of regular boundary points in this section we prove the main theorem for the case when g d r 6 let p g q g d r assume that p s where s is one of the defining hypersurfaces of d with defining function then there exists a neighborhood u of p so that d u z w u z w 0 it follows from lemma 3 2 that g d s lemma 4 1 with above notations and conditions g 6 constant furthermore if d is a relatively compact subdomain of d then g d is a locally closed open riemann surface proof let qj gj q and let pj be the projection of qj onto the boundary in the direction of the outward normal of bd at p let mj be the leaf on s that passes through pj and let vj be the unit complex tangent vector of mj at pj it is easy to see that g 1 j qj vj fkd q g 1 j qj vj f k d qj vj 1 for all j let v j g 1 j qj vj g 1 j qj vj passing to a subsequence we may assume that v j converges to a unit vector v since g j q v j 1 we have that g q v 1 therefore g 6 constant let q d and p g q after a change of local coordinate near p we assume that p 0 0 the positive rew axis is the outward direction of bd at p and the leaf of s 6 siqi fu and bun wong through p is locally parameterized by 7 0 let g g 1 g 2 it follows from the proof of lemma 3 2 that g 2 is identically zero in a neighborhood of q therefore g 1 6 constant thus g d 0 for sufficiently small 0 it remains to prove that after possible shrinking of g d 0 suppose that this is not true then there exists a sequence p j g d such that p j p and the second coordinate of p j is not zero let q j d be such that p j g q j after passing to a subsequence we assume that q j q d since g q p we have again that g 2 z w 0 for z w in a neighborhood of q this contradicts to the assumption lemma 4 2 let be a bounded domain such that m 0 b and s b 0 is smooth and levi flat for some 0 0 let 0 1 0 and u then for any sequence qj in that tends to 0 0 lim 0 lim j mc u qj me u qj 1 proof by theorem 3 3 we can choose a coordinate system in a neighborhood of m such that the outward normal of b is the positive rew axis for points on m then s is given in a neighborhood of 0 by a defining function of form z w rew r z z imw where r z z imw c imw 2 for some constant c 0 let n be a neighborhood of 0 and t t 1 1 s n be the diffeomorphism constructed in lemma 3 1 write qj zj aj ibj let tj 1 1 satisfy tj zj r zj z j bj ibj such tj is uniquely determined and tj 0 it is clear that lj tj is the leaf of through the projection of qj onto s in the direction of the positive rew axis let vj z arg w z tj z where the argument takes the principal branch since w z 0 1 2 for z vj z is well defined for sufficiently large j it follow from theorem 3 3 that vj z is harmonic let uj z be its harmonic conjugate such that uj 0 0 let hj z exp uj z ivj z let fj z w 7 z w be defined by z z and w w tj z hj z then fj u z w z w hj z tj z z w 0 where z w f 1 j z w since z 0 0 z z 0 0 and w z 0 w z tj z euj z 0 for z therefore in the z w coordinates lj 0 and the outward normal of b is the positive rew axis for points on lj on the other hand there exists a constant non compact automorphism groups 7 c 0 such that tj z c tj and 1 c hj z c for z and sufficiently large j therefore there exist constants a 0 b 1 such that w b rew a imw 2 0 fj u w b rew a imw 2 0 for sufficiently small and sufficiently large j thus for any two angles 1 0 2 and 2 2 we have b 1 fj u b 2 provided is sufficiently small let q j fj qj and w j be the second coordinate of q j it follows that 1 mc u qj me u qj mc b 2 q j me b 1 q j mc b 2 w j me b 1 w j by lemma 2 2 the last term can be chosen to be as close to 1 as we wish provided j 0 1 2 and 2 2 the following lemma is well known and its proof is elementary lemma 4 3 let d be a simply connected domain let dn be subdomains of d such that dj dj 1 and n j 1 dj d then dj is also simply connected for sufficiently large j we are now in position to prove the main theorem in the case when g d r 6 the proof uses ideas from our previous work fw we shall keep the notation and setup as at the beginning of this section let d 1 and d 2 be simply connected subdomains of d such that q d 1 d 2 d let v g d 2 by lemma 4 1 v is a locally closed open riemann surface since every open riemann surface is stein cf na 2 thm 3 10 13 and every holomorphic line bundle of an open riemann surface is trivial cf for thm 30 3 it follows from siu cor 1 that there exists a biholomorphic mapping from an open neighborhood w of v to an open neighborhood u of v 0 in v c such that g z w g z w 0 for z w d 2 we may assume that u v let 1 v be the universal covering map let z w 1 z w let 1 w d then z w c z w u z w 0 where z w 1 z w it is easy to see that z 0 z z 0 0 and w z 0 6 0 therefore b is smooth and hence levi flat in a neighborhood of m 0 8 siqi fu and bun wong fix a preimage p 1 p after a unitary transformation we may assume that p 0 0 since is locally one to one there exist unique liftings q j of qj for suf ficiently large j such that q j p since d 1 is simply connected and gj d 1 w d for sufficiently large j there exist unique liftings g j and g d 1 of gj and g respectively such that g j q q j and g q p choose 0 1 sufficiently closed to 1 such that g d 1 0 let 0 and u it follows from lemma 2 1 that mcd 1 q med q det g j q 2 mc g j d 1 q j det g j q 2 med qj det g j q 2 mc u q j det g j q 2 med qj det g j q 2 mc u q j det g j q 2 me u qj det g j q 2 mc u q j det g j q 2 det q j 2 me u qj mc u q j me u q j by lemma 4 2 mcd 1 q m e d q 1 since we can exhaust d by relatively compact simply connected subdomains lemma 4 3 we obtain that mcd q m e d q 1 it then follows from lemma 2 1 4 that d is biholomorphic to the bidisc 5 proof of the main theorem part ii in this section we prove the main theorem when g d s 6 let p g q g d s then there exists a neighborhood u of p such that u d z w u 1 0 2 0 where 1 and 2 are functions in a defining system of d let s 1 and s 2 be the corresponding defining hypersurfaces it follows from lemma 3 2 that g d s 1 s 2 since 1 p and 2 p are linearly independent over c after an affine linear transformation we may assume that p 0 0 1 p 0 1 and 2 p 1 0 lemma 5 1 the boundary point p is a local peak point of d proof assume that the leaves l 1 and l 2 of the foliations of s 1 and s 2 through p are given locally by 1 2 and 1 2 respectively after reparametrization we may assume that 0 0 p 0 1 0 and 0 0 1 after a change of coordinates of form z w 7 z w where z z 1 1 2 w and w w 2 1 1 z we may assume that l 1 and l 2 are given locally by 1 0 and 0 2 respectively thus s 1 and s 2 are defined by rew imw o z imw 0 and re z im z o w im z 0 respectively after possible shrinking of u we have d u rew imw 0 re z im z 0 let fp z w exp z 2 3 w 2 3 where the cubic root takes the principal branch then fp is a local peak function at p it follows from the maximal principle that bd is variety free at p therefore g d p non compact automorphism groups 9 lemma 5 2 let u then for any sequence qj in d that tends to p lim 0 lim j mcd u qj med u qj 1 proof the proof is similar to that of lemma 4 2 in nature we first project qj to the defining hypersurfaces s 1 and s 2 we then construct a new coordinate system such that the leaves through the projections of qj are discs on the coordinate planes and the outward normal of bd is constant for points on each leaf we then compare the invariant measures of d u with those of a product of two cones we provide details as follows as in the proof of lemma 5 1 we can choose a coordinate system in a neighborhood of p such that the leaves of the foliations of s 1 and s 2 through p are locally given by l 1 0 0 and l 2 0 0 for some 0 0 by theorem 3 3 we can further assume that the outward normal of s 1 is the positive rew axis for points on l 1 and the outward normal direction of s 2 is the positive re z axis for points on l 2 for 0 0 let t t be the diffeomorphism from 1 1 onto a neighborhood of 0 on s 1 as constructed in lemma 3 1 choose tj such that tj 0 and l 1 j tj is the leaf of the foliation of s 1 that passes through the projection of qj onto s 1 in the direction of the positive rew axis let v 1 j z arg 1 w z tj z by theorem 3 3 v 1 j z is harmonic on let u 1 j z be its harmonic conjugate such that u 1 j 0 0 let h 1 j z exp u 1 j z iv 1 j z define f 1 j z w z w by z z and w w tj z h 1 j z let 1 z w 1 f 1 j 1 z w and 2 z w 2 f 1 j 1 z w then 1 z 0 0 1 z z 0 0 1 w z 0 1 w z tj z euj z 0 2 0 w 0 2 w 0 w 0 2 z 0 w 2 z 0 w h 1 j 0 tj 0 0 for z and w h 1 j 0 tj 0 0 therefore in the z w coordinates l 1 j 0 and the outward normal of s 1 is the positive rew axis for points on l 1 j moreover l 2 0 w w h 1 j 0 tj 0 0 and the outward normal of s 2 is the positive re z axis for points on l 2 since h 1 j 0 1 and tj 0 0 f 1 j l 2 0 w w and 2 f 1 j u 2 for sufficiently large j now let s w be the diffeomorphism from 1 1 onto a neighborhood of 0 on f 1 j s 2 as constructed in lemma 3 1 choose sj such that sj 0 and l 2 j sj is the leaf of the foliation of f 1 j s 2 that passes through the projection of qj onto s 2 in the direction of the positive re z axis let v 2 j w arg 2 z sj w w let u 2 j w be its harmonic conjugate on such that u 2 j 0 0 let h 2 j w exp u 2 j w iv 2 j w define f 2 j z w z w by z z sj w h 2 j w and w w let 10 siqi fu and bun wong 1 z w 1 f 2 j 1 z w and 2 z w 2 f 2 j 1 z w then 1 z 0 0 1 z z 0 0 1 w z 0 1 w z h 2 j 0 sj 0 0 0 2 0 w 0 2 w 0 w 0 2 z 0 w 2 z sj w w eu 2 j w 0 for z h 2 j 0 sj 0 and w therefore in the z w coordinates l 1 j and l 2 j are discs on coordinate planes and the outward normal of s 1 and s 2 is the positive rew axis re z axis respectively for points on l 1 j l 2 j respectively let fj f 2 j f 1 j then for sufficiently large j 2 2 fj d u 2 2 furthermore there exists a constant c 0 such that z 2 re

provided is sufficiently small let q j z j w j fj qj then 1 mc u qj me u qj mc 2 2 2 2 q j me 2 2 2 1 q j mc 2 2 z j me 2 1 z j mc 2 2 w j me 2 1 w j it follows from lemma 2 2 that the last term can be chosen to be as close to 1 as we wish provided j 0 1 2 and 2 2 the lemma is now proved we now prove the main theorem in this case we use the notation and setup at the beginning of the section let q d and qj gj q let d 1 be relatively compact subdomain of d containing q for any 0 since g d p gj d 1 d u for sufficiently large j therefore by lemma 2 1 mcd 1 q med q mc gj d 1 qj med qj mcd u qj med
