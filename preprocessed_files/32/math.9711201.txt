operator on 0 q forms 1 q n on a bounded convex domain in cn is compact if and only if the boundary of contains no complex analytic equivalently affine variety of dimension greater than or equal to q 1 introduction let denote a bounded pseudoconvex domain in cn for 1 q n let l 2 0 q denote the space of 0 q forms with square integrable coefficients with the norm aidz i 2 ai 2 dv z where the prime indicates the summation over strictly increasing q tuples the neumann operator nq is the bounded inverse of the unbounded self adjoint surjective operator we refer the reader to fk ko kr 2 and the recent survey bs 3 for background on the neumann problem compactness of the neumann problem is a basic property with many useful conse quences in the case of domains with smooth boundary it implies global regularity of the neumann problem in the sense of preservation of the l 2 sobolev spaces see kn also the fredholm theory for toeplitz operators is a direct consequence of the compactness of the neumann problem v hi in a related context whether or not the neumann problem is compact has ramifications for certain c algebras of operators naturally asso ciated with a domain in cn compare for example sa catlin ca 2 proved compactness of the neumann operator on smoothly bounded do mains whose boundary satisfies property p the boundary of a domain satisfies prop erty p if for every positive number m there is a plurisubharmonic function c with 0 1 such that for all z b and w cn n 1 2 z z z w w m w 2 ca 2 property p was studied systematically under the name of b regularity in si in the context of arbitrary compact sets in cn it was recently observed that catlin s result remains true when no boundary smoothness at all is assumed the neumann prob lem is compact on a bounded pseudoconvex domain whose boundary is a b regular set st under the additional assumption that the domain is hyperconvex compactness of the neumann problem had been shown earlier in hi 1991 mathematics

we discuss compactness of the neumann problem on bounded convex domains we obtain a complete characterization of compactness by the absence from the boundary of complex analytic equivalently affine varieties of appropriate dimensions a closely related in fact in the context of convex domains equivalent question is that of compact solution operators for for 1 q n consider as an unbounded operator from l 2 0 q 1 to l 2 0 q ker a bounded linear operator sq from l 2 0 q ker to l 2 0 q 1 is called a solution operator for on 0 q forms if squ u for all u l 2 0 q ker the following terminology will be convenient an affine variety of dimension q is a relatively open subset of a complex affine subspace of cn of dimension q theorem 1 1 let be a bounded convex domain in cn let 1 q n the following are equivalent 1 there exists a compact solution operator for on 0 q forms 2 the boundary of does not contain any affine variety of dimension greater than or equal to q 3 the boundary of does not contain any analytic variety of dimension greater than or equal to q 4 the neumann operator nq is compact the implication 4 1 holds in general and is well known compactness of the neumann operator implies compactness of the canonical solution operator in fact the formula nq nq nq nq 1 nq 1 see r fk shows that nq is compact if and only if the canonical solution operators nq and nq 1 are compact note that in statement 1 it is the same to say that the canonical solution operator is compact since compactness is preserved by projection onto the orthogonal complement of the kernel of henkin and iordan hi recently showed that on a bounded convex domain the neumann operators are compact for 1 q n if there are no one dimensional analytic varieties contained in the boundary of the domain see si for the smooth case it has been known for some time that analytic discs in the boundary of a smooth pseudoconvex domain in c 2 obstruct compactness of the neumann operator specific examples for failure of compactness are given in li and kr 2 these examples are pseudoconvex reinhardt domains in cn theorem 5 in sa implies that on a pseudoconvex reinhardt domain compactness of the canonical solution operator on 0 1 forms is incompatible with analytic discs on the boundary to what extent analytic varieties in the boundary obstruct compactness of the neumann problem on general domains seems to be open on the other hand it is known that obstructions to compactness of the neumann problem can be more subtle than analytic varieties in the boundary so that the above characterization is false without some assumption on the domain matheos mt has recently shown that there exist smooth bounded pseudoconvex hartogs domains in c 2 without discs in their boundaries whose neumann operators are nonetheless not compact we remark that we make no explicit assumption on smoothness of the boundary how ever convexity implies that the boundary is lipschitz see e g mz 1 1 8 the remainder of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we briefly discuss the compactness of the neumann problem 3 equivalence of conditions 2 and 3 in theorem 1 1 this may be part of the folklore but we include the simple argument for completeness section 3 contains the proof that 2 implies 4 the proof of theorem 1 1 is completed in section 4 where we show that 1 implies 2 we conclude the paper with some additional remarks in section 5 acknowledgement the authors thank harold boas for stimulating conversations 2 varieties in the boundary of a convex domain in this section we show that 2 implies 3 in theorem 1 1 3 2 is trivial this may be viewed as the simplest manifestation of the general principle that on the boundaries of convex domains questions of orders of contact with analytic varieties are determined by the orders of contact with affine subspaces mc bs 2 y related observations may be found in n ch complex manifolds in general but smooth pseudoconvex boundaries are studied in bf we first observe the following if v is a q dimensional variety in cn then its convex hull v contains an affine variety of dimension q this is clear if n 1 for general n the observation follows by induction on the dimensions as follows if v has non empty interior in cn we are done if the interior of v is empty v is contained in a real hyperplane since then there are no 2 n line segments with end points in v which are linearly independent over r after a suitable change of coordinates this hyperplane is xn 0 by the open mapping property of non constant holomorphic functions applied to the restriction of the function zn to the regular part of v v is contained in the complex hyperplane zn 0 this completes the induction to prove that 2 implies 3 in theorem 1 1 assume now that b contains a q dimensional analytic variety v let p 0 be a regular point of v so that near p 0 v is a q dimensional complex manifold and assume without loss of generality that a support ing hyperplane for at p 0 is given by xn 0 the argument in the previous para graph shows that if vp 0 is the intersection of v with a small neighborhood of p 0 then vp 0 zn 0 consequently the convex hull of vp 0 is likewise contained both in and in zn 0 xn 0 hence in b but by the above observation this convex hull contains a q dimensional affine variety 3 sufficient conditions for compactness of nq proposition 3 1 let be a bounded pseudoconvex domain in cn assume that for every positive number m there exists a neighborhood u of b and a c 2 smooth function on u 0 1 such that for all z u the sum of any q equivalently the smallest q eigenvalues of the hermitian form 2 z z z n 1 is at least m then the neumann operator nq on is compact note that for q 1 the above condition on the hessian of reduces to the condi tion that appears in property p for q 1 this condition does not imply that is plurisubharmonic while it still implies that is subharmonic 4 siqi fu and emil j straube to prove proposition 3 1 we first note following h p 137 that the condition on implies 3 1 i n 1 2 z z z f if i m f 2 for all z u and f 0 q z where 0 q z denotes the space of 0 q forms at z and the prime indicates summation over increasing q 1 tuples i 3 1 can be seen by using a frame at z where the hessian of is diagonalized the proof of proposition 3 1 is now based on ca 3 theorem 2 1 see also bs 3 section 2 for a somewhat different approach to this type of estimate and ca 2 proof of theorem 1 the fact that no boundary smoothness is assumed necessitates working on smooth subdomains and using a regularization procedure for the forms involved that was introduced in st the details of this argument are carried out in st proof of corollary 3 to which we refer the reader in order to show that 2 4 in theorem 1 1 it now suffices to show that if the bound ary of a bounded convex domain contains no affine varieties of dimension q or greater then the assumption in proposition 3 1 is satisfied this can be done by suitably generalizing the arguments in si proposition 2 4 that cover the case q 1 the choquet theory has to be done for a cone of functions that reflects the condition on the hessian used in proposition 3 1 rather than for the cone of plurisubharmonic functions we also need a substitute for the fact that boundary points of a convex domain are peak points for the algebra of functions holomorphic on and continuous on when there are no varieties of positive dimension in the boundary of we now develop the necessary ideas for a compact set x in cn denote by c x the usual algebra of continuous functions on x with sup norm denote by h x the closure in c x of the functions holomorphic in a neighborhood of x a closed subset e of x is said to be a peak set if there exists f h x such that f z 1 on e and f z 1 on x e the function f is called a weak peak function on e proposition 3 2 let x be a compact convex subset of cn let z 0 x and let 1 q n then there exists a complex affine subspace l of dimension q 1 through z 0 such that x l is a peak set if and only if x contains no affine variety of dimension q through z 0 proof the direction follows easily from the maximum modulus principle to prove the reverse direction we need glicksberg s peak set theorem cf g 2 pp 58 which says that e is a peak set if and only if e h x for all finite regular borel measures h x where e is the restriction of to e we argue by induction the case n 1 is clear but see the case q n below assume the conclusion for n 1 n 2 we need to establish it for n since there is no affine variety of dimension q through z 0 and contained in x z 0 is a boundary point without loss of generality assume that z 0 is the origin and x re zn 0 set g z exp zn where the square root is the principal branch let j x zn 0 if q n let l zn 0 then j is a peak set the function g z is a peak function compactness of the neumann problem 5 now assume that 1 q n 1 then j is a compact convex subset of cn 1 and by the induction assumption there is a complex affine subspace l zn 0 cn 1 of dimension q 1 such that j l is a peak set for h j we now show that x l j l is a peak set for h x let be a finite regular borel measure onx h x thus we have for any holomorphic polynomial f and positive integer m that x f gm d 0 note that g although not itself analytic in a neighborhood of x is in h x letting m we obtain that j f d 0 the convex set j is polynomially convex so the holomorphic polynomials are dense in h j by the oka weil approximation theorem consequently j h j and hence j l h j by glicksberg s theorem using glicksberg s theorem in the other direction we conclude that j l is a peak set for h x this completes the induction and the proof of proposition 3 2 for an open set u cn denote by pq u the set of continuous functions on u such that for any z u and orthonormal set of vectors t 1 tq in cn the function 1 q cq 7 z 1 t 1 qtq is subharmonic on cq z 1 t 1 qtq u that is pq u consists of the continuous functions on u that are subharmonic on each q dimensional complex affine subspace in particular p 1 u is the set of all continuous plurisubharmonic functions and pn u is the set of all continuous subharmonic functions pq u is a convex cone in c u that is closed under taking the pointwise maximum of finitely many of its elements note that each function in pq u is a locally uniform limit of c smooth elements in pq of slightly smaller open sets this follows from the usual mollifier argument finally it is not hard to check that q 1 j 1 zj 2 q 1 n j q zj 2 pq cn we now return to a bounded pseudoconvex domain we denote by pq b the closure in c b of functions that are in pq in a neighborhood of b a probability measure on b is said to be a pq measure for z b if 3 2 z b d pq b we refer the reader to g 1 chapter 1 for a treatment of these measures in an abstract con text and for the elements of choquet theory in particular pq b satisfies the properties 1 1 1 3 in g 1 let be a bounded convex domain and z 0 a boundary point through which there is no affine variety of dimension q or higher that is contained in b we claim that the only pq measure for z 0 is the point mass at z 0 note that there is also no affine variety of dimension q through z 0 that is contained in this is a special case of the argument at the end of section 2 by proposition 3 2 there is a complex affine subspace l of dimension q 1 such that b l is a peak set for h let f be the corresponding weak peak function because f h f pq b 3 2 now shows that any pq measure for z 0 is supported on b l in suitable coordinates we may assume that z 0 is the origin and l zq zn 0 in 3 2 take now q 1 j 1 zj 2 q 1 n j q zj 2 we 6 siqi fu and emil j straube already know that the support of is contained in l where reduces to q 1 j 1 zj 2 we thus obtain from 3 2 that the support of consists of the point z 0 we next invoke edwards theorem g 1 theorem 1 2 for every continuous function u on b and z b inf b u d is a pq measure for z sup z pq b u on b because all pq measures have point support the theorem gives 3 3 u z sup z pq b u on b for every function u c b for m 0 let um z m z 2 it follows from 3 3 and a compactness argument similar to the proof of dini s theorem that um can be approximated uniformly on b by functions in pq b hence by functions that are smooth and in pq in a neighborhood of b in particular there exists a neighborhood u of b and a function pq u c 2 u such that 0 m z 2 1 on u after shrinking u if necessary the sum of the smallest q eigenvalues of the hessian of m z 2 is at least qm m because pq u the sum of the q smallest eigenvalues of the hessian of is non negative therefore satisfies the assumptions in proposition 3 1 and the proof that 2 implies 4 in theorem 1 1 is complete 4 necessary conditions for the compactness of solution operators to in this section we prove the implication 1 2 of theorem 1 1 one of the main tools in the proof is the ohsawa takegoshi extension theorem ot o 2 we also use an idea that comes from ca 1 see also dp we first prove an auxiliary lemma denote by k z w the bergman kernel function of a domain lemma 4 1 let be a bounded convex domain in cn 1 for any p 0 b and p 1 there exist constants c 0 and 0 0 such that 4 1 k p p ck p 2 p 2 for any 0 0 where p p 0 p 1 p 0 p 1 p 0 2 for any sequence pj converging to p 0 b 4 2 lim j k z pj k pj pj 0 locally uniformly on proof 1 let u be a ball with center p 0 and radius r the minimum of dist p 1 b and p 1 p 0 2 let n p 1 p 0 p 1 p 0 it is easy to see from the convexity of that t u for 0 p 1 p 0 2 where t z z n let 0 r 2 then for 0 0 k p p ck u p p ckt u p 2 p 2 ck p 2 p 2 compactness of the neumann problem 7 where the first inequality follows by localization of the kernel jp theorem 6 3 5 and the last inequality holds because t u 2 this part of the lemma is implicit in work of pflug see jp 7 6 and ohsawa o 1 on the completeness of the bergman metric we recall the proof for the reader s convenience without loss of generality assume that contains the origin it suffices to establish pointwise convergence vitali s theorem note that k pj k pj pj has norm 1 then implies that the convergence is locally uniform for z let f w k z w then f w f tw 0 as t 1 now fix t 0 t 1 then f pj k pj pj f pj f tpj k pj pj f tpj k pj pj f w f tw k z tpj k pj pj the domain is convex and so satisfies an outer cone condition therefore k pj pj as j see e g jp theorem 6 1 17 thus letting first j then t 1 we obtain part 2 of lemma 4 1 we are now in a position to prove the implication 1 2 in theorem 1 1 proof of 1 2 arguing indirectly we assume that there exists a compact solution operator sq on 0 q forms and b contains an affine variety of dimension q thus q n 1 after an affine transformation we may assume that z 0 cn z 2 b where z z 1 zq let z zq 1 zn let 1 z cn q 0 z it follows from the convexity of that 1 is a non empty convex domain in cn q z let 2 z cn q 2 z 1 then z cq z 1 2 every point in this set is the midpoint of a line segment joining a point in z 2 0 to a point in 0 1 let p 0 be a point in 2 and let pj p 0 j j n let fj z k 1 z pj k 1 pj pj then fj 1 1 we have fj z 2 2 k 1 pj 2 2 k 1 pj pj k 1 pj pj k 2 pj pj 2 2 n q k 1 pj pj k 1 2 pj 2 pj c for j large enough the first inequality follows because k 1 pj pj k 2 pj pj 1 2 k 1 pj 2 obtained by applying the reproducing property of k 2 pj to the func tion k 1 pj the last equality follows from the transformation formula of the bergman 8 siqi fu and emil j straube kernel the last inequality follows from 4 1 on the other hand by 4 2 fj 0 locally uniformly on 1 consequently no subsequence of fj can converge in l 2 2 by the ohsawa takegoshi extension theorem ot see also o 2 there exist l 2 holomorphic functions fj z z on such that fj 0 z fj z and fj c we now use an idea from ca 1 compare also dp let j fj z z dz 1 dz q then j 0 j l 2 0 q c let gj sq j denote by g j the form obtained from gj by discarding terms containing a dz j with q 1 j n for z 2 fixed we can think of the forms j and g j as 0 q and 0 q 1 forms respectively in the variables z z 1 zq z 1 note that we still have z g j j where z denotes in the variables z let be the standard pointwise inner product on forms in cq let c 0 be a cut off function such that 0 1 1 when t 1 2 and 0 when t 3 4 let z dz 1 dz q it follows from the mean value property of holomorphic functions that for z 2 fj z fk z c z 1 j k dv z c z 1 g j g k dv z is the formal adjoint of z c z 1 g j g k 2 dv z 1 2 therefore after integrating in z fj fk 2 c g j g k l 2 0 q 1 c gj gk l 2 0 q 1 as j k since fj has no subsequence that converges in l 2 2 gj has no subsequence that converges in l 2 0 q 1 contradicting the compactness of sq this completes the proof that 1 implies 2 in theorem 1 1 5 further remarks 1 the arguments in section 4 can be localized by using suitable cut off functions in z as well it is enough to control the geometry locally one then needs a lemma to the following effect let u 1 and u 2 be neighborhoods of a boundary point p 0 of a bounded pseudoconvex domain u 1 u 2 then k w w and k w u 2 are comparable uniformly for w u 1 this can be shown by applying the reproducing property of k u 2 to k w and using that k u 2 w w and k w w are comparable also compactness of the neumann problem is a local property if every boundary point has the property that a compactness estimate holds for forms supported near the point then the neumann problem is compact this shows that theorem 1 1 holds on domains that are locally convexifiable compactness of the neumann problem 9 2 it is noteworthy that in the proof that 1 implies 2 in theorem 1 1 we have only used that there is a compact solution operator to on the 0 q forms with holomorphic coefficients 3 on smooth bounded convex domains there is a hierarchy of regularity for the neumann problem which can be described in terms of the contact with the boundary of affine complex varieties nq is subelliptic if and only if the order of contact with the boundary of q dimensional affine complex varieties is bounded from above ca 3 mc y nq is compact if and only if the boundary contains no q dimensional affine varieties theorem 1 1 finally nq is globally regular regardless of whether or not b contains analytic varieties bs 1 4 we have stated our results for 0 q forms rather than p q forms as the index p plays no ro le in solving 5 to prove compactness of nq we have used the analogue for 0 q forms of prop erty p see proposition 3 1 our work shows that for convex domains this property is actually equivalent to compactness of nq on general pseudoconvex domains property p still seems to be the only systematic way to derive compactness of the neumann problem but to quote from bs 3 it is not yet understood how much room there is between property p and compactness 6 in the proof of lemma 4 1 we have used the fact that on a bounded convex do main k z z as z b while this is sufficient for the proof of lemma 4 1 it is interesting to note that for convex domains there is the optimal lower estimate k z z c dist z b 2 this can be shown by the ohsawa takegoshi extension the orem see ot o 2 and the fact that the estimate is true for bounded convex domains in the plane references bf eric bedford and john eric forn ss complex manifolds in pseudoconvex boundaries duke math ematical
