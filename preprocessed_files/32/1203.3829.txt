problem for a germ of a biholomorphic mapping from a nonminimal real hypersurface m cn into a real hyperquadric q cpn and prove that under certain nondegeneracy conditions any such germ extends locally biholomorphically along any path lying in the complement u x of the complex hypersurface x contained in m for an appropriate neighbourhood u x using the monodromy representation for the

this leads to the following definition a levi nondegenerate hypersurface m is called k l spherical at a point p m if there exists a germ at p of a biholomorphic map f sending the germ m p of m at p onto the germ of a k l hyperquadricq at f p it follows then that a levi nondegenerate hypersurface m is k l spherical at one point iff it has this property at all points and we simply call m a k l spherical hypersurface similar extension result holds if instead of levi nondegeneracy one assumes that m is essentially finite a condition on the so called segre map of m generalizing levi nondegeneracy see 23 and 12 using arguments similar to those in 12 one can further generalize pinchuk s theorem to the case when m is merely minimal in the sense of tumanov 26 i e when m does not contain any germs of complex hypersurfaces see 21 in this paper we study the analytic continuation phenomenon for biholomorphic maps from a nonminimal real analytic hypersurface m i e when m contains a complex hypersurface x in this case the levi form of m vanishes identically on x and m is not essentially finite at points in x also note that nonminimality is equivalent to the infinite type condition in the sense of kohn and bloom graham see e g 1 in appropriate local coordinates z w cn 1 c near the origin a real analytic nonminimal hypersurface m is given by imw rew m z z rew where z z rew is a real analytic function satisfying certain reality condition m 1 is an integer and x w 0 m is the complex hypersurface within the study of cr invariants of real hypersurfaces the nonminimal case is considered to be particularly difficult and very little is known in this setting some motivational examples and partial results concerning automorphism groups were obtained by v beloshapka 3 p ebenfelt b lamel and d zaitsev 10 m kolar and b lamel 14 see also references therein further in 14 the authors give normal form in the so called ruled case i e when the function z z rew is independent of rew and m 1 this is somewhat analogous to the rigid case for finite type hypersurfaces however in the general case the z and the w variables in the expansion of z z rew can mix which prevents the use of the chern moser type machinery for the con struction of the normal form it becomes apparent that different methods should be employed for the study of nonminimal hypersurfaces in this paper we use the approach of analytic continua tion as a tool for propagation of local cr invariants of real hypersurfaces and determination of cr invariants at nonminimal points our results show that the nonminimal case is quite different from the minimal one as new geometric phenomena occur the following illuminating example shows that the analytic contin uation fails in general in the nonminimal case the hypersurface m log appeared first in 2001 in the work of v beloshapka and a loboda as an example of an infinite type hypersurface with a large automorphism group example 1 1 consider the real analytic hypersurface given by m log z w u iv c 2 v u tan z 2 z 1 2 or by a global complex defining equation w w e 2 izz note that m log contains the complex hypersurface x w 0 but it is levi nondegenerate at all other points the set x divides m log into two connected components m given by u 0 and m given by u 0 it follows that m x arctan v u z 2 analytic continuation of holomorphic mappings 3 and so for u 0 we have im lnw z 2 this shows that the map f u 0 c 2 given by z z w lnw 2 argw 2 maps m onto an open subset of the nondegenerate hyperquadric q z w c 2 imw z 2 however f clearly does not extend across x neither holomorphically nor as a holomorphic correspondence in fact the branch f u 0 c 2 of the multiple valued map z z w lnw satisfying 2 argw 3 2 sends m into an open subset of a different hyperquadric q z w c 2 imw z 2 this and examples given in 3 10 and 14 as well as other examples given later in this paper suggest that given a nonminimal hypersurface m containing a complex hypersurface x and a local map f from m into a hyperquadric q one cannot expect in general that f extends holomorphically to x and since the complement of x is not simply connected the analytic continuation if exists can lead to a multiple valued extension of f furthermore since m x is not connected different components of m x can be mapped by different branches of the multiple valued extension into different hyperquadrics our principal result establishes such multiple valued holomorphic extension phenomenon we call a real hypersurface m containing a complex hypersurface x pseudospherical if at least one of the components of m x is k l spherical for some k l n 1 0 l k n 1 theorem 1 let m cn be a connected smooth real analytic hypersurface containing a complex hypersurface x assume that m x is levi nondegenerate and that m is pseudospherical then i there exists an open neighbourhood u of x in cn such that for p m x u any biholomorphic map f of m p into a k l hyperquadric q extends analytically along any path in u x as a locally biholomorphic map into cpn in particular f extends to a possibly multiple valued locally biholomorphic analytic mapping u x cpn in the sense of weierstrass ii if one of the components of m x is k l spherical then the second component is k l spherical with possibly k l 6 k l somewhat surprisingly example 6 2 of section 6 gives a real hypersurface m c 3 for which k l 6 k l in part ii of theorem 1 however if f extends to u x as a single valued map then both components of m x have the same signature of the levi form as shown in proposition 6 4 the nature of multiplicity of the extension in the above theorem depends only on the geometry of the hypersurface m and does not depend on the choice of the map f in section 7 we give a precise description of the monodromy of analytic continuation of f about x by constructing explicitly the monodromy operator in analogy with the corresponding theory of singular odes to suppress technical details we give a simplified formulation of our result below and refer the reader to section 7 for further details theorem 2 under the conditions of theorem 1 there exists a linear representation 1 u x aut cpn such that the analytic continuation f of f along a cycle u x satisfies f f 4 i kossovskiy and r shafikov the cyclic subgroup 1 u x aut cpn is determined by m uniquely up to conjugation and the conjugacy class is a biholomorphic invariant of m remark 3 additional motivation for the study of mappings from nonminimal hypersurfaces into quadrics comes from the fact that only the hypersurfaces that are levi nondegenerate and k l spherical outside the complex locus x admit large automorphism groups in particular for n 2 these are the only hypersurfaces that admit the estimate dimaut m 0 5 for the local automorphism group see 2 for details and 14 for some examples the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we provide the necessary background about segre varieties and the associated notion of segre map and prove the local one to one property of the segre map in u x for hypersurfaces under consideration in section 3 we apply this property to study the behaviour of segre sets and show that any point in the punctured neighbourhood u x can be connected with q m x by a chain of segre varieties we use this fact to construct in section 4 the desired analytic continuation along some specific paths by means of extension along segre varieties in the spirit of k diederich and j e forn ss 7 k diederich and s pinchuk 8 and 23 we also introduce the notion of q segre property for a map f and use it for appropriate understanding of the extension along iterated segre varieties combining the results of sections 3 and 4 we prove a crucial corollary establishing analytic continuation of the initial germ f 0 to an arbitrary point r u x along some specific path in section 5 we use this result to prove the continuation along an arbitrary path using the global nature of the complexified automorphism group of the target hyperquadric q which gives the first part of our principal result we also provide a number of examples of analytic maps that extend germs of local biholomorphic mappings to a hyperquadric most of these are certain blow ups of the unit 3 sphere giving both single valued and multiple valued maps in section 6 we prove the second part of theorem 1 and give an example of m that can be mapped to inequivalent hyperquadrics in section 7 we describe the monodromy of the obtained multiple valued map showing that the monodromy can be expressed in terms of a scaled element of gln 1 c the monodromy matrix we also establish an intriguing connection between nonminimal pseudospherical hypersurfaces and linear differential equations of order n with an isolated singular point by proving the monodromy formula for the multiple valued mapping f the hypersurface x m playing the role of an isolated singularity for holomorphic maps under consideration becomes an analogue of a single point in cp 1 as an isolated singularity of linear differential equations in section 8 we consider separately the case where m is algebraic and prove that the multiple valued mapping f in this case extends to x either holomorphically or as a holomorphic correspondence acknowledgments we would like to thank v beloshapka and b

2 background segre varieties let m be a smooth real analytic hypersurface in cn n 2 0 m and u a neighbourhood of the origin in what follows in this paper we consider only connected real hypersurfaces if u is sufficiently small then m u admits a real analytic defining function z z where the function z w is holomorphic in u u and for every point u we can associate to m its so called segre variety in u defined as q z u z 0 3 analytic continuation of holomorphic mappings 5 note that segre varieties depend holomorphically on the variable in fact we may find a suitable pair of neighbourhoods u 2 u z 2 uw 2 cn 1 c and u 1 u 2 such that q z w u z 2 uw 2 w h z u 1 4 is a closed complex analytic subset here h is a holomorphic function following 8 we call u 1 u 2 a standard pair of neighbourhoods of the origin from the definition and the reality condition on the defining function the following basic properties of segre varieties easily follow z q qz z u 1 5 z qz z m z u 1 6 m z u 1 q qz m u 1 7 the set i z u 1 q qz is also a complex analytic subset of u 1 if m contains a complex hypersurface x then for any p x qp x and qp x 6 p x so ip x if f u u is a holomorphic map sending a smooth real analytic hypersurface m u into another such hypersurface m u and u is as in 4 then f z z f qz q z 8 for z close to the origin the invariance property of segre varieties will play a fundamental role in our arguments for the proofs of these and other properties of segre varieties see e g 7 8 9 or 1 the space of segre varieties qz z u 1 can be identified with a subset of cn for some n 0 in such a way that the so called segre map z qz is holomorphic see 7 since we have qp x for any p x the segre map sends the entire x to a unique point in cn and accordingly is not even finite to one near each p x i e m is not essentially finite at points p x on the other hand if m is levi nondegenerate at a point p then its segre map is one to one in a neighbourhood of p in fact the last property can be strengthened as follows proposition 2 1 let m cn be a smooth real analytic hypersurface containing a complex hypersurface x 0 x m suppose that m x is levi nondegenerate then a standard pair of neighbourhoods u 1 u 2 for 0 m can be chosen in such a way that the segre map u 1 cn is locally injective at any point p u 1 x proof denote by the set of points where the rank of the map is less than n clearly is a complex analytic subset of u 1 and x we will show that u 1 can be taken sufficiently small so that u 1 x u 1 let be any irreducible component of of positive dimension such that 0 it follows from injectivity of at levi nondegenerate points that m x let u and u be the two connected components of u 1 m we claim that either u or u indeed suppose that on the contrary u 6 and u 6 let d dim first observe that m 6 sing for otherwise the set sing would divide reg into a union of two open components because m divides u 1 and therefore m divides this is however impossible because for irreducible the set reg is connected see e g 6 it follows that m contains regular points of and considering a small neighbourhood of any such point we conclude that the dimension of the real analytic set m equals 2 d 1 since this set splits reg on the other hand x m x from the above arguments so m x which shows that the dimension of m can not be odd that proves the claim now if for example u we can move along the normal direction to m at 0 and get w u for the perturbed set and a sufficiently small neighbourhood w of the origin 6 i kossovskiy and r shafikov this means that x 6 though for the perturbed set x which is a contradiction because dim dimx n and therefore their intersection is stable under small perturbations 6 from the above we conclude that all components of different from x do not intersect x the zero dimensional components of do not accumulate at 0 and therefore we may choose the neighbourhood u 1 so small that x u 1 as required proposition 2 1 motivates the following definition 2 2 a smooth real analytic hypersurface m containing a complex hypersurface x 0 is called segre regular in a neighbourhood u of the origin if the segre map of m is locally injective at each point p u x we immediately conclude from proposition 2 1 that for a smooth real analytic hypersurface m containing a complex hypersurface x 0 and levi nondegenerate in u x a standard pair of neighbourhoods u 1 u 2 of the origin can be chosen in such a way that m is segre regular in u 1 the segre regularity will be the basic assumption for most of the statements in this paper we note once again that for a segre regular in a neighbourhood u hypersurface the image x consists of a unique point in cn and near all points p u x the map is one to one finally we describe the geometry of segre varieties for the nondegenerate hyperquadric q in the target domain in this case the segre variety of a point 0 n cpn is the projective hyperplane q 0 n cpn h 0 and the set q cp n of all segre varieties coincides with the space cpn of all projective hyperplanes in cpn the segre map in this case is a global natural one to one correspondence between cpn and the space cpn 3 exhaustion of a punctured neighbourhood by segre sets let m x u 1 u 2 be as in section 2 following 1 we introduce the segre sets of m in a neighbourhood of the origin we choose q u 1 and define the zero and the first segre sets sq 0 s q 1 of q simply as s q 0 q and s q 1 qq u 1 higher order segre sets s q j j 2 are defined by induction as s q j r s q j 1 qr u 1 finally we define s q j 0 s q 2 j for q x we have s q j x u 1 for any j 0 as it is shown in 1 segre sets have the following properties a s q j s q j 2 for q u 1 and s q j s q j 1 for q m u 1 b r sqj q srj and so r s q q sr c s q j can be presented as q j where q j cn is a complex submanifold n n and cn cn is a holomorphic projection in this section we show that the open connected set u 1 x can be exhausted by the even segre sets sp 2 j j 1 for any fixed p u x analytic continuation of holomorphic mappings 7 proposition 3 1 let m cn be a smooth real analytic hypersurface containing a complex hypersurface x 0 and u 1 u 2 be the standard pair of neighbourhoods for m at the origin suppose that m is segre regular in u 1 then for any q u 1 x sq u 1 x proof property b above shows that for any two segre sets s q s r q r u 1 either s q s r or s q sr holds so u 1 x can be represented as a disjoint union of some s q q u 1 x since each q sq 2 the proposition now asserts that in fact this disjoint union consists of just one element s q we first claim that every s q 2 q u 1 x is open at any point r s q 2 sufficiently close to q except possibly the point r q indeed let u q be a neighbourhood of q such that the segre map is one to one in u q take any point r sq 2 so that r 6 q and r u q then r qs s qq qr in particular qr qq 6 the injectivity of in u q implies that qr 6 qq a sufficiently small perturbation of r does not change the properties qr 6 qq from the definition of u q and qr qq 6 as in the proof of proposition 2 1 we use the fact that the sum of the dimensions of these two analytic sets is at least n and refer to 6 so for any r sufficiently close to r there exists a point s such that s qq and s qr so that r qs and r sq 2 as required this proves the claim now take any s q q u 1 x and consider an interior point q sq 2 take a ball b centred at q and such that b sq 2 then for all r sufficiently close to q we have sr 2 b 6 this follows from the continuity of the map z qz therefore there exists r b such that r sr 2 we get the inclusions r s 2 r r s 2 q which imply by definition of segre sets the inclusion r s q 4 for all r sufficiently close to q this shows that q is an interior point of s q 4 taking a point s sq 2 j for some j 0 we use a similar argument to conclude from openness of s q 4 at q that s is an interior point of s q 2 j 4 this finally shows that all points of the set s q are in fact its interior points and so s q is an open set the connectivity of u 1 x now implies that the decomposition of u 1 x into segre sets consists of a unique element and u 1 x sq for any q u 1 x as required example 3 2 for the hypersurface m log see introduction we may choose u 1 u 2 c 2 and p 0 1 m then m is segre regular in u 1 and simple computations show s p 0 p s p 1 w 1 s p 2 c 2 x z 0 w 6 1 sp 3 s p 4 c 2 x it is also not difficult to see that taking u 1 z w and p 2 0 all points lying in the j th segre set s p j satisfy w 12 e 2 j 2 this inequality shows that no segre set of a fixed depth j can a priori exhaust the punctured neighbourhood u 1 x for a nonminimal segre regular hypersurface m 4 extension along segre varieties the result of the previous section showing that iterated segre varieties of a fixed point p m x exhaust the punctured neighbourhood u 1 x suggests that the desired continuation of a given local biholomorphic map f of m into a quadric q can be obtained by extending f along iterated segre varieties of the point p the extension along segre varieties is based on their invariance property 8 and gives an effective way of holomorphic continuation for holomorphic maps of real submanifolds in complex spaces see 23 12 let m x u 1 u 2 be as in section 2 with 0 x m let p m x u 1 we first introduce the following notation by qp 0 p 1 pj 1 we denote the segre variety qpj 1 where p 0 p pk 8 i kossovskiy and r shafikov qpk 1 k 1 2 j 1 so that pk s p k k 0 1 2 j 1 and qp 0 p 1 pj 1 s p j in this section we show that a local biholomorphic map f sending the germ of m at a point p m x into a hyperquadric can be extended in a certain sense to a neighbourhood of any qp 0 p 1 pj 1 for j 1 the segre variety qp 0 contains p and the extension can be understood naturally while for j 2 the meaning of extension will be specified let r u 1 x u r u 1 x be an open polydisc centred at r and f u r cpn be a biholomorphic map onto its image for q u r and s qq so that q qs we denote by qs c the connected component of qs u r containing q we say that f has the q segre property in u r if for any q u r and s qq the image f qs c is contained in a projective hyperplane in cpn the definition is motivated by the fact that quadrics are the only hypersurfaces in cpn for which the segre varieties are projective hyperplanes we now formulate the key claim for the main result of this paper proposition 4 1 let m cn be a smooth real analytic hypersurface x cn be a complex hypersurface 0 x m u 1 u 2 be a standard pair of neighbourhoods at the origin suppose that m is segre regular in u 1 and that for some point p m x and a polydisc u p centred at p there exists a biholomorphic map f 0 u p cpn such that f 0 m u p q where q cpn is a nondegenerate real hyperquadric then there exist connected neighbourhoods w 1 w 2 wj of qp 0 qp 1 qpj 1 respectively so that pk wk k 0 1 j 1 and locally biholomorphic maps f 1 f 2 fj fk wk cpn k 1 2 j such that i the intersection u p w 1 contains a polydisc w 0 centred at p 0 such that f 1 is a holomorphic extension of f 0 w 0 ii for each k 2 j the intersection wk 2 wk contains a polydisc u pk 2 centred at pk 2 such that fk is a holomorphic extension of fk 2 u pk 2 iii for each r qpk k 0 1 j 1 there exists a polydisc u r wk 1 such that fk 1 u r has the q segre property in u r proof we use the coordinate system in the preimage in the form z w cn 1 c and denote by u z and uw the projections of a polydisc u u 1 cn onto the z coordinate subspace and the w axis respectively we also suppose that in these coordinates segre varieties of m are graphs of the form w h z h o u z and x is given by w 0 in the target domain we denote by q the segre varieties of points cpn with respect to the hyperquadric q step 1 we first prove part i and iii for k 0 we choose w 0 u p to be a polydisc centred at p and such that for each segre variety qq q qp u 1 the intersection qq w 0 is the graph of a function over w z 0 in particular it is connected the existence of such a polydisc follows from the fact that p qp p qq for q qp and that the 1 jets of segre varieties qq q qp at p are bounded in the intersection of qp with the closed polydisc u 1 u 2 so we can choose a connected neighbourhood w 1 qp such that for s w 1 the intersection qs w 0 is also connected and nonempty we follow the strategy in 8 and 23 and consider the set a 1 z w 1 cpn f 0 qz w 0 q in the same way as it is done in proposition 3 1 in 23 one can show that a 1 is a nonempty closed complex analytic subset in w 1 cpn of dimension n but unlike the situation in 23 we do not need to exclude an analytically constructible set from qp since the hypersurface in analytic continuation of holomorphic mappings 9 the target domain is the hyperquadric q whose segre map is globally injective if for some z w 1 1 2 cpn and 1 6 2 then z 1 z 2 a 1 f 0 qz w 0 q 1 q 2 which is not possible since f 0 is biholomorphic in w 0 dimq 1 q 2 n 2 while qz w 0 is of dimension n 1 so a 1 is in fact the graph of a holomorphic map f 1 w 1 cpn to show that f 1 is locally biholomorphic we observe that local injectivity of implies that for distinct z 1 z 2 that are close to each other the intersection qz 1 qz 2 w 0 has dimension at most n 2 so by shrinking w 1 if necessary we conclude that z 1 a 1 and z 2 a 1 forces z 1 z 2 so that f 1 is locally one to one and hence biholomorphic also the invariance property of segre varieties 8 implies that for z w 1 sufficiently close to p f 0 z f 1 z which proves i for the proof of iii for k 0 we consider the set v 1 of points q u 1 such that qq w 0 6 clearly v 1 s w 0 qs 9 since w 0 is open v 1 is also open and because each qs is path connected and w 0 is open and path connected v 1 is also connected for points s u 1 close to p f 1 f 0 and the invariance property implies that f 1 transfers qs w 0 to an open subset of a projective hyperplane now take a point a w z 0 cn 1 and consider an open connected subset va v 1 which consists of q u 1 such that a ww 0 qq 6 clearly each va is open va b ww 0 q a b so that va is connected and v 1 a w z 0 va the set va always contains points sufficiently close to p and we may consider on va the holomorphic map which assigns to q va the k jet k 2 of qq at the point a the components of this map corresponsing to derivatives of order 2 vanish for points in va close to p since for such points f 1 qq w 0 is contained in a projective hyperplane and consequently vanish on entire va so for all q va f 1 transfers the connected component of qq w 0 containing the point with z coordinates equal to a to an open subset of a projective hyperplane from this and 9 it follows that the desired q segre property holds for f 1 in w 0 now we take any r qp and prove the q segre property for f 1 is some polydisc u r we choose u r w 1 and so that qp u r is the graph of a function over u z r so that for p sufficiently close to p qp u r is connected since w 1 qp for p close to p qp w 1 and the q segre property of f 1 in w 0 implies by the uniqueness property that f 1 qp is an open subset of a projective hyperplane and so does f 1 qp u r now arguments analogous to those used above show the q segre property for f 1 in u r which completes step 1 step 2 we now prove ii and iii for j 2 this will give us the base case for a general induction argument the proof for this case will be a small modification of the one in the previous step from i w 0 w 1 and f 0 w 0 f 1 w 0 we choose a polydisc u p 1 w 1 with the q segre property for f 1 and a connected neighbourhood w 2 of qp 1 such that for each segre variety qq q w 2 the intersection qq u p 1 is the graph of a function over u z p 1 in particular it is connected consider the set a 2 z w 2 cpn f 1 qz u p 1 q the q segre property of f 1 and arguments similar to those in 23 show that a 2 is an nonempty complex analytic set in w 1 cpn of dimension n by shrinking w 2 if needed we obtain in a similar fashion that a 2 defines a locally biholomorphic mapping f 2 w 2 cpn since qp 1 p 10 i kossovskiy and r shafikov we conclude that p w 2 and for points p w 2 sufficiently close to p qp 2 w 1 and the intersection w 0 wp is connected by the invariance property of f 1 f 0 in w 0 we conclude that the point in a 2 over p must equal f 1 p i e f 2 p f 1 p f 0 p which proves ii for j 2 the proof of iii for this case follows the same pattern as in step 1 step 3 we now perform the induction step by assuming that j 2 and that for all smaller j the proposition holds i e for all k j the desired extensions and polydiscs with the q segre property have been already obtained we treat the case k j in the same way as in step 2 we obtain using theq segre property of fj 1 a polydisc u pj 1 a neighbourhood wj of qpj 1 with qq u pj 1 connected for q wj and a locally biholomorphic map fj wj cpn corresponding to the n dimensional complex analytic set aj z wj cpn fj 1 qz u pj 1 q to prove ii take now z close to pj 2 so that qz is contained in wj 1 to clarify what fj z equals recall that by assumption the proposition is proved for smaller j therefore fj 1 qz u pj 1 fj 3 qz u pj 1 q fj 3 z so by the definition of fj and fj 2 we obtain that fj z fj 2 z and ii is proved finally to prove iii for fj we take r qpj 1 and a polydisc u r such that for p close to pj 1 the intersection qp u r is connected we also may suppose that qp wj since fj 2 qp u pj 2 contained in a projective hyperplane and fj 2 fj in u pj 2 wj we conclude that fj qp is contained in a projective hyperplane to obtain the entire q segre property for fj we repeat the arguments from the proof in step 1 this completes the proof of the theorem we now formulate the following corollary which is a weaker form of our main extension result but is convenient for applications corollary 4 2 let m x p u 1 u 2 f 0 satisfy proposition 4 1 then for each point q u 1 x there exists a connected path 0 1 u 1 x 0 p 1 q such that f 0 extends analytically along as a locally biholomorphic mapping to cpn and for any r there exists a polydisc u r centred at r such that the mapping fr has the q segre property in u r here fr is the element of the analytically continued germ f 0 along at the point r proof proposition 3 1 implies that there exist points p 1 p 2 p 2 j 1 u 1 x such that q qp 0 p 1 p 2 j 1 j 1 we set p 2 j q and choose connected paths 0 2 qp 1 2 4 qp 3 2 j 2 2 j qp 2 j 1 such that 0 2 0 p 0 0 2 1 p 2 2 4 0 p 2 2 4 1 p 4 2 j 2 2 j 0 p 2 j 2 2 j 2 2 j 1 p 2 j q 10 then applying proposition 4 1 we conclude that f 2 is a local biholomorphic extension of f 0 along 0 2 f 4 along 2 4 f 2 j is a local biholomorphic extension of f 2 j 2 along 2 j 2 2 j of course we use the connectivity and simple connectivity of the segre varieties as holomorphic graphs taking now to be the union of the paths of 0 2 2 j 2 2 j we obtain the desired local biholomorphic extension of f 0 the q segre property for fr r now follows from proposition 4 1 5 extension along an arbitrary path in this section we prove that f 0 can be analytically continued along any path in u 1 x we begin with the following proposition analytic continuation of holomorphic mappings 11 proposition 5 1 let m x u 1 u 2 satisfy proposition 2 1 r u 1 x u r u 1 x a polydisc centred at p and let f g be two biholomorphic mappings u r cpn with q segre property in u r then there exists a linear automorphism of cpn such that g f proof let u 1 cn and cpn cpn be the segre maps in the preimage and the target domain respectively u f u we consider the map g f 1 which is a biholomorphic map u cpn onto its image from the q segre properties of f and g we know that maps many connected components of intersections of projective hyperplanes with u to open subsets of projective hyperplanes and want now to prove the same for the set of hyperplanes intersecting a ball b in some coordinate chart in cpn to do so put r f r and fix some coordinate ball b u centred at r let q qr so that r sq choose a polydisc u r with the following properties i u r u r f u r b ii sq u r is a graph over u z r we use the notation from proposition 4 1 according to property ii there exists a connected neighbourhood v q such that for each r u r there exists q v q such that r qq and qq u r is connected we simply use the fact that qr is close to qr q choosing u r small enough we may suppose the segre map is injective in v q consider now the following mapping taking q v q we associate qq to it then consider f qq u r an open subset of a projective hyperplane and using associate a point in cpn to it this is an injective holomorphic map from v q to cpn denote its image by w consider also the set of projective hyperplanes intersecting b and denote this open connected set in cpn by a then w is an open subset of a by property i and by definition of the map sends l a b with l a w here l a is a projective hyperplane that corresponds to a cpn to open subsets of projective hyperplanes considering as in the proof of proposition 4 1 the high order jets of l a b as holomorphic mappings of a we see that their components corresponding to derivatives of order 2 vanish for l a w so they must vanish for all l a a and we obtain the desired hyperplane to hyperplane property of for any hyperplane intersecting b as it can be verified from many references see for example 25 24 or 16 17 in this case must be a local biholomorphic symmetry of the system of flat second order complex differential equations yxkxl 0 k l 1 2 n 1 hence it is a linear automorphism of cpn and g f as required we now can prove part i of theorem 1 which we formulate in the following theorem theorem 5 2 let m cn be a smooth real analytic hypersurface x cn a complex hyper surface 0 x m suppose that m is levi nondegenerate in m x and pseudospherical then there exists a neighbourhood u 1 of the origin such that for each point p m x u 1 any local biholomorphic mapping f 0 c n p cpn transferring m p onto an open piece of a nondegenerate real hyperquadric q cpn extends analytically along arbitrary continuous path 0 1 u 1 x 0 p as a local biholomorphic mapping into cpn proof let u 1 u 2 be a standard pair of neighbourhoods of the origin such that m is segre regular in u 1 suppose on the contrary that the claim of the theorem is false then since for t close to 0 the extension with q segre property already exists we can choose the smallest t 0 0 t 0 1 such that f 0 does not extend analytically to t 0 along the path 0 t 0 with the q segre property in some neighbourhood of each t 0 t t 0 t 0 is simply the supremum of t such that f 0 extends 12 i kossovskiy and r shafikov to t along 0 t with the q segre property at each point applying corollary 4 2 we obtain a polydisc u r centred at r t 0 and a mapping f r in u r with the q segre property we now take some t close to t 0 with t t 0 and r t u r and denote the corresponding extension of f 0 with the q segre property at some polydisc u r by fr without loss of generality we may assume that u r u r then applying proposition 5 1 for the polydisc u r and mappings f r fr in it we get a linear automorphism of cp n such that fr f r in u r this equality clearly implies by the global nature of that f r is a holomorphic extension of fr to u r r with the q segre property which contradicts the definition of t 0 let y y be complex manifolds and f 0 y p y p be a local biholomorphic mapping between them suppose that the germ f 0 p can be extended analytically along any continuous path y starting at p by a multiple valued analytic mapping in the sense of weierstrass we mean the collection fq q of all possible germs obtained by analytic extension of f 0 p along all possible continuous paths y starting at p and ending at arbitrary points q y see for example 20 for more details of this concept if for an arbitrary path y the analytic extension of f 0 p along gives the same element f 0 p then the multiple valued analytic mapping simply determines a holomorphic mapping y y the monodromy theorem note that if y and y are domains in c then this notion simply gives an accurate set up for a multiple valued analytic function putting now y u x y cpn we can formulate the following corollary 5 3 let m x u 1 f 0 p satisfy theorem 5 2 then the mapping f 0 c n p cpn extends locally biholomorphically to a multiple valued analytic mapping f u 1 x cpn in the sense of weierstrass moreover each analytic element fr r of f at a point r u 1 x has the q segre property the following examples as well as example 6 2 and the model example m log illustrate be haviour of the map f a special case of example 5 4 is considered in 10 and 14 and example 5 5 is borrowed from 10 example 5 4 consider the standard hyperquadric q z w c 2 imw z 2 11 and the multiple valued locally biholomorphic mappings f c c 0 cp 2 given as z zw w w 2 r 0 then it is not difficult to check by plugging f into the defining equation ofq that f 1 determined by 2 arg w 2 maps q p p 0 1 q onto an open piece of the smooth real analytic hypersurface m z w c 2 w w 1 z 4 i z 2 1 z 1 12 all m are nonminimal as they contain x w 0 and segre regular in z 1 f turns out to be exactly the multiple valued locally biholomorphic mapping provided by corollary 5 3 for z the mapping f is single valued and extends holomorphically to x w 0 thus f 1 performs a certain blow up of the 3 sphere in c 2 for rational the multiple valued mapping f is finitely valued and extends to x as a holomorphic correspondence 22 the graph of f extends even to an algebraic subset of cp 4 in this case for irrational the mapping f is infinitely valued and furthermore the graph of a germ of f does not even extend to a closed complex analytic subset of u 1 x c 2 note that such extension is possible for the model example m log analytic continuation of holomorphic mappings 13 example 5 5 considering the quadric q defined by 11 and the blow ups gm given by z zwm w w m z m 0 the image of q under gm is the union of algebraic hypersurfaces given by km imw z 2 w 2 m 13 these are nonminimal with x w 0 and segre regular in appropriate polydiscs um 0 here gm are single valued and extend to x holomorphically 6 application transfer of sphericity the above continuation results imply the following remarkable fact on the geometry of non minimal real hypersurfaces throughout the section we denote by m and m the connected components of m x the next theorem is reformulation of theorem 1 part ii theorem 6 1 let m cn be a smooth real analytic hypersurface containing a complex hyper surface x cn and levi nondegenerate in m x suppose that m is pseudospherical with m being k l spherical then m is k l spherical with possibly k l 6 k l proof we fix a standard pair of neighbourhoods u 1 u 2 such that m is segre regular in u 1 and choose points p m u 1 and p m u 1 and a local biholomorphic map f 0 c n p cpn with f m q for a nondegenerate hyperquadric q cpn of the signature k l applying corollary 4 2 we can find a polydisc u p and a local biholo morphic map f u p cpn with q segre property put p f m u p then p cpn is a smooth real analytic levi nondegenerate hypersurface biholomorphically equivalent to m u p the q segre property of f and the holomorphic invariance of segre varieties imply that all segre varieties of p in some neighbourhood of f p are open pieces of pro jective hyperplanes now choose some affine chart containing p and make an invertible affine transformation such that in new coordinates p has the form 2 rew h z z o 2 z cn 1 w c where h z z is a nondegenerate hermitian form then segre varieties of p have the form w b h z a this equation determines a hyperplane for all sufficiently small a and b which implies that all monomials in dots in fact vanish and therefore p is a nondegenerate real hyperquadric the following example shows that surprisingly the equality k l k l does not hold in theorem 6 1 even for algebraic nonminimal hypersurfaces in cn n 2 in particular m and m may have different signature of the levi form example 6 2 let q imw z 1 2 z 2 2 c 3 be a real strictly pseudoconvex hyperquadric consider the following blow up map f z 1 z 1 w z 2 z 2 w w w choosing a connected neighbourhood d q of the point 0 0 1 q and the single valued biholomorphic branch of f given by 2 argw 2 it is straightforward to check that f 1 maps d onto an open piece of the smooth real analytic nonminimal hypersurface m w w i z 1 2 1 2 i z 2 2 w z 1 4 2 1 2 i z 2 2 w 2 14 i kossovskiy and r shafikov satisfying rew 0 and z 1 z 2 w be small enough one should rewrite the equation of q in the new coordinates it is easy to check that m is levi nondegenerate outside w 0 so m satisfies the conditions of theorem 6 1 and at the point p m p 0 0 0 the levi form is positive definite though at the point p m p 0 0 0 the levi form has eigenvalues of different signs so m is 2 0 spherical though m is 1 1 spherical in fact the single valued biholomorphic branch of f given by 2 arg w 3 2 maps the negative half m of m onto a domain on the indefinite hyperquadric q imw z 1 2 z 2 2 unlike the case n 3 for n 2 all hyperquadrics in cp 2 are equivalent to the 3 sphere s 3 c 2 and the phenomenon from example 6 2 can not hold however it may still happen that the multiple valued mapping obtained in theorem 5 2 maps m and m to different hyperquadrics in cp 2 though these hyperquadrics are equivalent by means of some aut cp 2 example 6 3 consider the hypersurface m log c 2 see introduction then the multiple valued map f z w z lnw maps the domain m m given by the condition u 0 to the hyperquadrics imw 2 k z 2 k z and the domain m m given by u 0 to the hyperquadrics imw 2 k 1 z 2 k z each of the hyperquadrics looks as k q 0 whereq 0 is the standard hyperquadric imw z 2 and the element aut cp 2 is the affine transformation z w z i as a small consolation for the paradoxical phenomenon illustrated by examples 6 2 6 3 we show now that this does not happen if f is single valued proposition 6 4 let m cn be a smooth real analytic hypersurface containing a complex hypersurface x cn and levi nondegenerate in m x suppose that m is pseudospherical with m being k l spherical and the multiple valued analytic mapping f obtained in theorem 5 2 is single valued then i m is also k l spherical ii f maps both components m m to the same hyperquadric q proof choose u 1 p p f 0 q as in the proof of theorem 6 1 and apply propositions 3 1 and 4 1 to find a sequence p 0 p p 1 p 2 j 1 such that the point p qp 2 j 1 as well as all the continuations f 1 f 2 j since f is single valued the continuations are simply restrictions of f onto some domains in u 1 x by the definition of f 2 j we have f 2 j 1 qp q f 2 j p so that f qp q f p but p m and accordingly p qp so f p q f p which means that f p q since p m is arbitrary this shows that f m q and proves both i and ii it was communicated to us by v beloshapka that an alternative proof of theorem 6 1 can be deduced from the differential equations characterizing sphericity of a levi nondegenerate hyper surface obtained by j merker in 16 17 7 the monodromy in this section we give a description of the multiple valued extension obtained in theorem 5 2 it will allow us to find an interesting interaction between nonminimal pseudospherical hypersurfaces in cn and linear differential equations of order n analytic continuation of holomorphic mappings 15 let m x u 1 p f 0 satisfy theorem 5 2 and let f be the multiple valued analytic mapping obtained there consider a noncontractible cycle 0 1 u 1 x 0 1 p which is a generator of the fundamental group of u 1 x let f 1 p be the analytic continuation of the element f 0 p of f along to the point p applying the q segre property of f 0 f 1 and using proposition 5 1 we obtain a mapping aut cpn such that f 1 f 0 general properties of analytic continuation and the global character of imply that the linear automorphism is independent i of the choice of a generator ii of the choice of an analytic element q fq 0 of f at a point q u 1 x to show ii for example we choose a path q such that fq 0 is an extension of f 0 along q and denote by fq 1 the extension of fq 0 along we suppose without loss of generality that q again the q segre property of the elements of f and proposition 5 1 show that there exists an element aut cpn such that fq 1 fq 0 note that fq 1 is obviously the extension of f 1 along q but f 1 f 0 so that the extension of f 1 along q equals by the uniqueness fq 0 and we conclude that fq 0 fq 0 and finally as required the proof of i is analogous to see the dependence of on the choice of the initial local biholomorphic mapping f 0 of m onto a hyperquadric choose some other local biholomorphic mapping f 0 of m p to a possibly different hyperquadric q and denote the continuation of f 0 along by f 1 and the corresponding linear automorphism of cpn by then applying proposition 5 1 we conclude that there exists aut cpn such that f 0 f 0 and so the continuation of f 0 along equals f 1 f 0 on the other hand f 1 f 0 f 0 so that f 0 f 0 and in fact the linear automorphism is a linear projective equivalence of q and q we finally may express as follows 1 14 relation 14 shows that the monodromy matrix is defined up to matrix conjugation and scaling we will call this conjugacy class the monodromy operator of m and denote it by this term is used in analogy with the monodromy matrix of a linear differential equation of order n at a singular point 13 the monodromy operator does not depend on the choice of the cycle the point p u 1 x the element fp of f the target hyperquadric q and the initial local biholomorphic mapping f 0 of m or m into q and is only a characteristic of the holomorphic geometry of a nonminimal pseudospherical real analytic hypersurface this geometry can be also characterized for example by the jordan normal form of defined up to scaling of its diagonal part or alternatively by the cyclic subgroup h k k z aut cpn generated by defined up to conjugation note that the subgroup h exactly determines all possible elements of f at a point p u 1 x and all the elements have the form fp k k fp 0 k z where fp 0 is some fixed element both the scaled jordan normal form of and the conjugacy class of the subgroup h aut cpn precisely characterize the monodromy of f about x the analogy with differential equations goes even further choose the local coordinate system in such a way that x is given in u 1 by the condition w 0 consider the n 1 n 1 matrix defined up to scaling we set a 1 2 i ln 16 i kossovskiy and r shafikov we may choose any of the matrix logarithms and consider in a neighbourhood u p of p the mapping g 0 u p cpn g 0 z w w a f 0 z w here we understand f 0 z w as the column of its n 1 homogeneous coordinates and by w a we understand the functional matrix exponent e a lnw the definition of g 0 does not depend on the choice of the uncertain factor of since the uncertain factor clearly just scales the column representing g 0 and that does not change the element g 0 z cpn z u p then g 0 extends along an arbitrary path in u 1 x because f 0 and the matrix valued mapping w a do and determines a multiple valued analytic mapping g since the monodromy of w a is given by w a 1 w a w a 1 the monodromy of g is given by g 0 w a 1 f 0 w a f 0 g 0 hence by the monodromy theorem 20 g is a single valued holomorphic mapping and we obtain the following formula characterizing the multiple valuedness of f f wa g the monodromy formula where g is a holomorphic mapping u 1 x cpn note that a very similar formula holds for the monodromy of the fundamental matrix of solutions of a linear differential equation of order n 13 the monodromy formula generalizes examples 1 1 5 3 5 4 and gives a local monodromy representation of an arbitrary multiple valued extension of a local biholomorphic mapping from a nonminimal real hypersurface to a quadric we summarize our arguments in the following theorem which is the expanded formulation of theorem 2 theorem 7 1 let m x u 1 q satisfy theorem 5 2 and f be the multiple valued analytic mapping obtained there then there exists an element aut cpn such that 1 the monodromy of f with respect to a generator of the fundamental group of u 1 x is given by fq fq where fq is an arbitrary element of f at a point q u 1 x in particular the collection of all elements of f at a point q is given by the natural action of the cyclic subgroup of aut cpn generated by on a fixed analytic element of f at q 2 all possible changes of the target hyperquadric q cpn and the local biholomorphic map f 0 transferring m p to q transform the monodromy matrix by the formula 1 where aut cpn and thus generate the monodromy operator the correspondence m j m where j m is the scaled jordan normal form of is only characterized by holomorphic geom etry of m in particular j m is a biholomorphic invariant of m 3 if the local coordinates z w at the origin are chosen in such a way that x w 0 then there exists a single valued holomorphic mapping g u 1 x cpn such that the following monodromy formula holds f wa g analytic continuation of holomorphic mappings 17 where 2 ia is a complex logarithm of the monodromy matrix remark 7 2 if is a scalar matrix i e the monodromy operator is the identity we conclude by the monodromy theorem 20 that the multiple valued map f is in fact a single valued locally biholomorphic mapping f u 1 x cpn example 7 3 for the hypersurfaces m c 2 given by 12 with z and the hypersurfaces km c 2 given by 13 the monodromy operator is the identity and the map f is single valued for the hypersurfaces m with z the monodromy operator has a diagonal jordan normal form j m diag e 2 i e 4 i 1 thus the monodromy representation becomes f w 0 0 0 w 2 0 0 0 1 z 1 1 finally for the model example m log the appropriately scaled jordan normal form is given by j m log 1 0 0 0 1 2 i 0 0 1 decomposing the matrix to the sum of a diagonal and a nilpotent matrices and computing the logarithm we get a 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 and so the monodromy representation takes the form f wa z 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 lnw 0 0 1 z 0 1 8 the algebraic case in this section we show that if the nonminimal pseudospherical hypersurface m in the preim age is algebraic then the multiple valued extension f obtained by theorem 5 2 admits certain holomorphic extension to x we start with preliminaries let m cn be a smooth real analytic nonminimal hypersurface containing a complex hypersurface x and levi nondegenerate in m x we choose local coordi nates z w cn 1 c at the origin in such a way that the complex hypersurface contained in m is given by x w 0 and m is given locally by the equation imw rew m z z rew where z z rew is a real analytic function in a neighbourhood of the origin such that z z 0 6 0 identically o 2 and m is a positive integer see 1 for the existence of such coordinates we may further consider the local complex defining equation see 1 17 10 of the form w w z z w where 1 o 2 is real analytic so finally we come to the following defining equation for m w w ei z z w 15 18 i kossovskiy and r shafikov where the complex valued real analytic function in a polydisc u 0 satisfies the condition z z w o 2 and also the reality condition z z w e i z z w z z w 16 reflecting the fact that m is a real hypersurface in what follows we call 13 the exponential defining equation for a nonminimal hypersurface m generalizing the ideas in 14 consider in a sufficiently small polydisc u 0 the real analytic subset m z w u w w e i k z z w k containing the complex hypersurface x w 0 where k 2 is an integer it follows from 16 that m is in fact a smooth real analytic hypersurface and that the mapping z z w k w k argw k sends the half of m satisfying rew 0 into the half of m satisfying rew 0 the hypersurface m is called the k root of m since the inverse mapping z z w w k 17 is holomorphic in all of u and locally biholomorphic in u x it maps the entire m into m preserving the complex hypersurfaces this means that m x is levi nondegenerate as well theorem 8 1 let m x u 1 p f 0 satisfy theorem 5 2 suppose in addition that m is real algebraic and let f u 1 x cpn be the multiple valued holomorphic extension obtained in theorem 5 2 then i if the mapping f is single valued then it extends to x holomorphically and f m q ii if the mapping f is multiple valued then it extends to x as a holomorphic correspondence furthermore if the coordinates z w in u 1 are chosen in such a way that x u 1 w 0 then f admits the representation f z w f z k w where f cn 0 cpn is a single valued holomorphic mapping and k 2 is an integer iii let d u x x d be a domain where the multiple valued mapping f admits a single valued branch then f d extends continuously to d x proof fix p m and f 0 as in theorem 5 2 by webster s theorem 27 the graph of the local biholomorphic mapping f 0 u p cpn lies in a complex algebraic set a u 1 cpn of dimension n accordingly the graph f of the extended mapping f lies in a as well let a be the irreducible component of a containing f and let a u 1 and a cpn be the natural projections compactness of cpn implies that the projection is proper so by remmert s theorem a is a complex analytic subset in u 1 so a u 1 consider now the set e q u 1 dim 1 q 0 then e is a complex analytic subset in u 1 see e g 15 and dime n 1 because otherwise 1 e becomes a complex analytic subset in a of dimension n therefore x e and we can find a point o x such that some polydisc u o does not contain points from e to prove i we suppose that f is single valued and choose a projective hyperplane cpn such that does not intersect the finite set 1 o cpn choosing appropriate coordinates in cpn we analytic continuation of holomorphic mappings 19 may assume that cpn cn and accordingly 1 u o cn by riemann s theorem we conclude now that x is a removable singularity for f u o thus f extends holomorphically to the complement of e since dime n 2 it follows that f extends holomorphically to all of u see e g 11 the inclusion f m q follows from the uniqueness to prove ii we note that by algebraicity of f 0 its multiple valued extension f is in fact finite valued which means that there exists an integer k 2 such that the extension of the analytic element f 0 p along the path k where is the generator of 1 u 1 x does not change this element choose now the coordinates z w in u 1 in such a way that x w 0 and p m and consider m the k root of m it follows from the arguments above that m satisfies all the conditions for theorem 5 2 and we may also consider the multiple valued mapping f corresponding to the pseudospherical hypersurface m the map given by 17 gives the relation between m and m and thus shows that the monodromy of f with respect to the generator of 1 u x is simply the identity since the monodromy of f with respect to k is the identity we conclude that the map f is single valued and from claim i f extends to x holomorphically and the explicit formula for now implies ii for the proof of iii only the multiple valued case is not immediate it is easy to see from ii that for each o z 0 0 x the limit lim z w o f d z w f z 0 0 which shows the continuity of the glued map in d x this completes the proof of the theorem remark 8 2 when q is strictly pseudoconvex and f is single valued the set f x in the above theorem becomes a connected locally analytic set in q which implies that f x consists of one point using the k root construction it is easy to verify from here that in the multiple valued case the cluster set of x with respect to any single valued branch of f in a domain d u x x d consists of exactly one point
