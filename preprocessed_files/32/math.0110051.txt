projective manifolds analogues of the structure theorems for lie algebras reducing these first to semi simple and solvable ones the solvable being iterated extensions of abelian ones the roles of semi simple solvable and abelian are respectively played here by the orbifolds of general type special manifolds and third manifolds either rationally connected or with 0 a complex projective manifolds x is said to be special if it has no map onto an orbifold of general type the orbifold structure on the base being given by the divisor of multiple fibres suitably defined we show that manifolds either rationally connected or with 0 are special we also show that x is special if and only if it has no bogomolov sheaf which are rank one coherent subsheaves of maximal kodaira dimension p of p x for some p 0 an orbifold version of iitaka s cn m additivity conjecture implies that special manifolds have a canon ical decomposition as towers of fibrations with generic orbifold fibres either rationally connected or with zero kodaira dimension this decomposition is obtained by alternatively iterating orbifold iitaka fibrations and suitably defined rational quotients for any complex projective manifoldx we next construct a functorial fibration cx x c x called its core 1 such that its general fibre is special and contains any special subvariety of x meeting it the core is thus the constant resp identity map iff x is special resp of general type as a consequence of the special case of the orbifold version of iitaka conjecture cn m when the base orbifold is of general type we show that the core has an orbifold base of general type if x is not special the core thus canonically decomposes any x into its components in the dichotomy special the fibres versus general type in the orbifold sense the base special manifolds being conjecturally orbifold combinations of the first two types of the fundamental trichotomy rationally connected 0 general type of classification theory this decomposition is deeply linked with other aspects of classification theory we indeed conjecture and show in some few cases that special manifolds have an almost abelian fundamental group and are exactly the ones having zero kobayashi metric or a potentially dense set of rational points over any field of definition finitely generated over q this immediately leads to a natural extension of lang s conjectures to arbitrary x s and even to orbifolds this decomposition gives a simple synthetic view of the structure of arbitrary x s and indicates that the natural frame of classification theory is the category of orbifolds to which our observations should be extended the present observations actually work for any compact ka hler x which are considered here most of them can also be applied to other algebraically closed fields with the usual problems of separability in positive characteristics 1 from the french coeur a case to which a dumas s statement applies well comme l anglais n est que

large extent by the following two theorems the first one says that any such lie algebra is in a unique way an extension of a semi simple lie algebra by a solvable one next this extension can further be decomposed also in a canonical functorial way as a composition of extensions with abelian kernels the objective of this paper is to establish two similar structure results for arbitrary complex projective varieties x in birational geometry the first theorem asserts the existence and uniqueness of a fibration cx x 99 kc x called the core of x such that its general fibres are special while its orbifold base is of general type the second result only conjectural asserts that the core can be obtained in a functorial canonical way as a composition of orbifold rational quotients and iitaka fibrations this statement depends on an orbifold version of iitaka s conjecture cn m one thus gets a canonical decomposition of x the elementary components of which are the va rieties of pure type in the fundamental trichotomy of algebraic geometry rationally connected 0 general type the orbifold structures seem to be unavoidable and to lie at the heart of classification theory which should thus deal with this category of objects we now describe the content of the different sections in 1 we introduce the notion of orbifold base of a holomorphic fibration f x y f is thus surjective and its fibres are connected between compact ka hler manifolds this is simply 1 1 4 a q divisor on y suitably defined by the multiple fibres of f this orbifold structure carries naturally a canonical bundle a kodaira dimension and a fundamental group the kodaira dimension y f is the minimum of the kodaira dimensions of the orbifold bases when f runs over all models of f which are the fibrations bimeromorphically equivalent to f this minimum is achieved by f itself when y 0 by 1 12 but may be smaller in general we next show 1 7 that y f behaves as in the classical case where f idx under composition with generically finite maps u x 99 kx and stein factorisation in the next section we define canonically a rank one subsheaf ff of p x by saturating the inverse image of ky this sheaf is an intrinsic invariant of the equivalence class of fibration its kodaira dimension is y f as an aplication the orbifold base of f has kodaira dimension y f if f is what we call neat see 1 2 we next show 1 25 the countable upper semi continuity of y f in families finally we show how to compute on suitable models the orbifold structure on the base of a composition g f of two fibrations from the orbifold bases of g and f this computation plays an essential role in the proof of the shown case of the orbifold additivity conjecture in 4 it is also the clue to the definition of the orbifold base of a fibration between orbifolds see section 2 6 in 2 we first define general type fibrations f x 99 ky as the ones having y f dim y 0 special manifolds x are defined as the ones having no f of general type and special fibrations as special varieties and classification theory 5 the ones having special general fibres we list without proof some examples of special manifolds the two most important ones are the rationally connected manifolds and manifolds with 0 notice however that being special does not give any restriction on the kodaira dimension except for the top one for example any elliptic surface with base elliptic or rational is special if it has a section somewhat unexpectedly maybe the moduli of fibrations do not play any role in our considerations we next show various geometric properties of special and general type fibrations the most important one 2 12 is that any special fibration f x 99 ky dominates any general type fibration g x 99 kz in the sense that there exists y 99 kz such that g f from which one concludes that on any x there exists at most one fibration both special and of general type one of the main results of the present paper is the existence of such a fibration we get it by the two possible approaches either from above as the lowest special fibration on x obtained by geometric means see section 3 or from below as the highest general type fibration on x see 5 17 the second approach is less geometric and hides the motivations and origins of the constructions made but has technical advantages similar to those of the axiomatic method turning theorems into definitions once the foundations have been laid see footnote 2 below 1 the next subsection shows the bijective correspondance between bogomolov sheaves and general type fibrations 2 25 from which we conclude that special manifolds are characterised by the absence of such sheaves applying a result from c 95 we obtain a first simple proof that xis special if either rationally connected or with c 1 x 0 we next show 2 37 among other things that the general fibre xs of a fibration h x s is special if it is special for any s in a set e not contained in a countable union of zariski closed subsets with empty interior of z this property which we call zariski regularity for specialness is together with 2 12 one of the main ingredients in the proof that the core of a manifold is a special fibration 3 3 this section ends with a brief sketch of the extension of the considerations of the present paper to the orbifold category it seems that most of them extend without any difficulty to the orbifold context including the notions of orbifold modification and of differential form on an orbifold y d with smooth y and the support of d of normal crossings in particular the notion of bogomolov sheaf and the sheaf ff associated to a fibration between orbifolds make sense the geometric aspect seems more delicate to handle see section 6 1 for some subtle problems on surface orbifolds which are classical in the non orbifold context the notion of orbifold differential form we introduce interpolates between the usual one when d is empty and the classical notion of y log d when d is reduced which corresponds to the limiting case of infinite multiplicities it seems that this topic desrves by itself further develop ments in 3 we construct and start to study the core cx x 99 kc x of a manifold we first show 3 3 that its general fibres are special this fails for general singular varieties and does not follow from the original definition obtained applying the construction of meromorphic quotients recalled in 1 b russell once compared these advantages to the ones of stealing over honest work 6 fre de ric campana section 12 from this result we immediately get 3 21 that rationally connected manifolds are special simply because p 1 is special the notions around rational connectedness are recalled we next deduce in 3 25 from g h s that if r x is the rational quotient of x see 3 22 for this notion then c r x c x we next describe 3 30 and 3 37 the core and list the special manifolds in dimensions 2 and 3 after having introduced see 3 6 the higher kodaira dimensions of a compact complex manifold from the description so obtained we deduce that in these cases the core is a fibration of general type when x is not special the decomposition theorem 5 8 asserts that this is true in any dimension the next 4 states see 4 3 the orbifold version of iitaka conjecture cn m and shows 4 4 the special case when its orbifold base is of general type this result is one of the main technical tools of the present paper the proof consists in extending the classical weak positivity results of fujita kawamata and wiehweg for direct image sheaves of pluricanonical forms to the orbifold situation by suitably introducing the orbifold divisor into the proofs 5 contains the geometric consequences of the orbifold additivity result theorem 4 4 manifolds with 0 are special 5 1 the albanese map of a special manifold is surjective connected and has no multiple fibres in codimension one 5 3 we also show 5 5 resp 5 7 that the essential dimension ess x dim c x of x is equal to its dimension dim x n resp to n 1 iff x is of general type resp iff x has a fibration of general type with generic fibre a curve either rational or elliptic these are two special cases of the decomposition theorem already stated above this theorem is established in 5 8 we also show that the decomposition theorem implies the invariance of the essential dimension under finite e tale covers in particular that such covers of a special manifold are still special we finally observe see subsection 5 6 that the decomposition theorem asserts that any nonspecial x has a unique fibration both special and of general type and a unique maximum bogomolov sheaf we then show that the stein factorised product of two fibrations of general type is itself of general type 2 this gives together with another application of 4 4 the second construction of the core from below as the highest general type fibration on a given x the 6 presents various conjectures related to the core we first start with defining and comparing some orbifold variants of the notion of rational connectedness one of them the weakest possibly equivalent to the strongest of these notions turns out to give a good substitute of the notion of rational quotient in the orbifold context provided the orbifold version of conjecture cn m holds this implies see section 6 4 that the core can be canonically and functorially decomposed into a 2 maybe surprisingly it was not no noticed since bo 78 that one could so naturally define a fibre product of two bogomolov sheaves although the techniques used in the present paper are available since two decades this is because the question is obvious if one starts from above the geometry of orbifolds and general type fibrations but very hidden and unnatural if one starts from the sheaves special varieties and classification theory 7 succession of orbifold iitaka moishezon 3 fibrations and rational quotients defined in section 6 3 see 6 for more details this construction thus only depends on cn m in its orbifold version so that the core actually gives directly the final step of this decomposition without producing the intermediate steps in subsection 6 5 we conjecture the deformation invariance of all the invariants introduced in particular ess x and the higher kodaira dimensions so that in particular deformations of special manifolds should be special the next subsections deal with two other similar theories built on related notions of specialness and general type fibrations they seem to both differ from the one presented here but presently no example is known that distinguishes them in 7 we consider the fundamental group and conjecture abelianity conjecture 7 1 that a special manifold should have an almost abelian fundamental group this conjecture is supported and motivated by the fact that rationally connected manifolds are simply connected that this conjecture is standard for the case 0 and the preceding conjectural orbifold decomposition of any special manifold as a tower of fibrations with fibres of these two types this conjecture seems to sum up all conjectures with the same conclusion we show that this conjecture is true for linear and torsionfree solvable representations of the fun damental group as an immediate consequence of previous result by various authors as usual we extend this cojecture to the orbifold case anyway necessary to solve the non orbifold one in higher dimensions in 8 we establish and apply an orbifold version see 8 2 of the famous extension theorem of kobayashi ochiai asserting roughly that meromorphic nondegenerate ie somewhere submer sive maps from a dense zariski open subset u of a complex manifold v to a variety of general type y do not have essential singularities along the boundary divisor d v u our version essentially says this holds true if factorises as f with f x 99 ky is a fibration of general type and u 99 kx meromorphic the proof is an orbifold version of the proof of kobayashi ochiai this result implies among other more general results that a manifold x is special if there is a meromorphic nondegenerate map cn 99 kx this is a special instance where the kobayashi pseudometric of x vanishes identically if has dense image in the metric topology the next 9 discusses two conjectures concerning the kobayashi pseudometric of a compact ka hler x the first one 9 2 states that special manifolds are exactly the ones having zero kobyashi pseudometric dx the second one 9 10 states that for any x dx is the lift by the core cx x 99 kc x of the orbifold kobayashi pseudometric of the base orbifold of cx defined in 9 23 and that this orbifold pseudometric is a metric outside some algebraic subset s of c x recall that the orbifold base of cx is of general type if not a point so this second part of the conjecture 9 10 is the orbifold version of lang s hyperbolicity conjecture the next 10 resp 11 is the exact analog of 9 for arithmetic geometry resp the function field version of 10 we do not give a more detailed description here because our discussion rests only on known results by many authors 3 usually called iitaka fibration the construction obtained independently by b moishezon mois remained apparently unnoticed 8 fre de ric campana this paper ends with the 12 which is a technical appendix exposing with proofs the con struction of meromorphic quotients of equivalence relations of geometric origin 12 4 identifying points connected by chains with irreducible components in a given family of subvarieties this construction appeared it seems for the first time in c 81 we follow here the original argument in a slightly simplified form this construction was exposed also in ko 96 by a different approach corrected and exposed in a detailed way in de we complete this construction by introducing the notions of zariski regularity section 12 4 and stability section 12 5 of constant use in this context in particular the notion of stability per mits to give a criterion 12 31 for the quotient to have fibres in the class as subvarieties used to construct the chains providing the equivalence relation the present version is the sixth one it differs from the original one in two aspects first by the definition of multiple fibres based on inf no longer gcd see 1 1 4 second and more importantly by the proof that the base orbifold of the core is of general type which was only conjectured in the preceding versions the first point was also observed independently of me by s lu after he read the first versions of the present paper one can replace the gcd multiplicities by the present ones without changing any statement or proof except for a small refinement in the proof of the former version of proposition 4 20 the new definition is better behaved with respect to hyperbolicity questions and bogomolov sheaves but seemingly not with respect to the fundamental group for which gcd multiplicities work very well aknowlegements i would like to thank f bogomolov j p demailly and c voisin for discus sions which permitted me to improve sections 7 and 10 p eyssidieux asked me about the function field version of 10 which lead to 11 f bogomolov noticed that general type fibrations might be linked with what is called here bogomolov sheaves this link is established in 2 25 one direction was in fact shown in the first version in the transcendantal context of section 8 moreover after a first version of this work was written i got further stimulating comments and references included here from d abramovitch j l colliot the le ne and b totaro who independently suggested me to include conjecture iva i thank heartily thank l bonavero s druel j p demailly l manivel c mourougane m paun and e

gaps and inaccuracies they also suggested me to reorganise the exposition according to the technical order of proofs the present version thus differs considerably from the preceding ones in this respect further l bonavero and s druel provided me with considerable help in the manipulation of latex special thanks are due to e viehweg who gave me a decisive hint in the proof of the crucial lemma 4 22 1 orbifold base of a fibration 1 1 fibrations before giving definitions let us start with 1 1 1 a motivating example special varieties and classification theory 9 example 1 1 let x 0 e p 1 c where e is an elliptic curve let x x j where x e c where c is a hyperelliptic curve and j t h is the involution acting diagonally on x by a translation t of order 2 on e and by the hyperelliptic involution h on c then both x 0 and x have natural fibrations on p 1 c with generic fibre e they cannot be distinguished by this information although they differ fundamentally at the levels of kodaira dimension fundamental group kobayashi pseudo metric and arithmetics for appropriate choice of e if however we take into account the multiple fibres of the fibrations onto p 1 c we see that in the second case of x the base is not really p 1 c but rather the orbifold of general type c h this we shall now generalise 1 1 2 fibrations a fibration f x 99 ky is a surjective i e dominant meromorphic map with connected fibres between normal irreducible compact complex analytic spaces x and y see below for the precise definition of the fibres of a meromorphic map of course this fibration is said to be holomorphic or regular if so is the map f another fibration f x 99 ky is said to be equivalent to f if there exists bimeromorphic maps u x 99 kx and v y 99 ky such that f u v f we denote by f or xy the generic fibre of f we also say that f is a model or a representative of f we shall not distinguish between f and its equivalence class a fibration f x 99 ky canonically defines see c 85 a meromorphic map f y 99 kc x with c x the chow scheme of x by sending the generic y y to the point of c x parametrising the reduced fibre xy of f over y let f c x be the image of y by f it is a compact irreducible analytic subset of c x bimeromorphic to y such that its incidence graph is bimeromorphic to y the above correspondance induces a bijective map between equivalence classes of fibra tions and compact irreducible analytic subsets of c x with incidence graph bimeromorphic to x definition 1 2 assume that f x y is a holomorphic fibration an irreducible weil divisor d on x is said to be f exceptional if f d has codimension 2 or more in y we say that f x y is neat if f is holomorphic x y are smooth and if there moreover exists a bimeromorphic holomorphic map u x x with x smooth such that each f exceptional divisor of x is also u exceptional by raynaud and hironaka flattening theorems any fibration f 0 x 099 ky 0 has a neat model in which x may be choosen arbitrarily bimeromorphic to the domain x 0 of the initial fibration f 0 indeed first blow up x in such a way that f 0 b x 99 ky 0 is holomorphic where b x 99 kx 0 is bimeromorphic then flatten f 0 b by blowing up y 0 to get a smooth y finally take a smooth model x of x y 0 y assume the fibration f is holomorphic we say that the holomorphic fibration f x y with x y smooth dominates f if there exists a commutative diagram in which u v are bimeromor phic obviously f is then equivalent to f 10 fre de ric campana x u f x f y v y observe that any f dominating a neat fibration is itself neat more generally we say that the fibration f x 99 ky dominates the fibration f x 99 ky if there exists a diagram as above with u v meromorphic and bimeromorphic this notion is well defined on equivalence classes let f x y be a holomorphic fibration with x y smooth we say as in vi 82 that f is prepared if the locus y y of points y with a smooth f fibre xy has a complement contained in a normal crossing divisor d y such that moreover f 1 d is also a divisor of normal crossings in x any fibration is dominated by a prepared model again by an immediate application of hironaka s results the models of fibrations considered can thus always be assumed to be prepared 1 1 3 multiplicities assume now x y to be smooth and f to be a holomorphic fibration let y be the union of all codimension one irreducible components of the locus of y s y such that the scheme theoretic fibre of f over y is not smooth for each component i of let di j j mi jdi j be the union of all components counted with their scheme theoretic multiplicities of f i which are mapped surjectively onto i by f define mi m f i inf mi j j j it is called the multiplicity of f along i 1 1 4 multiplicity divisor of a fibration the q divisor f i i 1 1 mi i on y will be called the multiplicity divisor of f the motivation for its introduction comes from the examples above and in example 1 3 below observe we can also write f d y 1 1 m f d d where d ranges over the set of all irreducible divisors of y and m f d is the multiplicity of f along d defined as m f d inf mj j j f d where f d j j f d mjdj r and j f d is the set of all components of f d which are mapped surjectively onto d by f while r is f exceptional indeed m f d 1 if d is not a component of 1 2 orbifolds 1 2 1 notion of orbifold an orbifold y is a pair consisting of a compact irreducible complex space y together with a weil q divisor of the form i i 1 1 mi i for distinct prime divisors i of y and positive integers mi we also say that is an orbifold structure on y we write for the support of in which the coefficient of each i is one or equivalently each mi if y is smooth and if the support of is a simple normal crossings divisor such pairs y were introduced and used by v shokurov in sk 92 under the name of standard pairs we shall say that the orbifold y is a klt orbifold if the pair y is klt this is an abbreviation for kawamata log terminal this seems to be the right category to consider morphisms being the obvious ones special varieties and classification theory 11 the next example shows why such pairs are rather called orbifolds here we also note that this term is commonly used in similar situations either in differential geometry or when y is a curve in f m or l for example example 1 3 let f x y be a finite ramified galois cover between manifolds let its ramification divisor be i i 1 1 mi i the order of ramification above the generic point of i being mi this preceding example occurs in the construction of fibrations with multiple fibres as in 1 1 for example 1 2 2 orbifold base of a fibration definition 1 4 let f be a holomorphic fibration as in 1 1 2 and f be the multiplicity divisor of f we call y the orbifold base of f 1 2 3 orbifold invariants and fibrations definition 1 5 let y be an orbifold we define its canonical bundle as the q divisor ky ky on y and its kodaira dimension as y y ky one can also associate to an orbifold its fundamental group considered below the term orbifold arises in this context from the following reason first from the special case when f is the quotient of a fibration f x y by a finite group g acting on some galois cover x of x the action of g preserving the fibration f and such that f has no multiple fibre in codimension 1 in this case y f is precisely the orbifold y g we then say that the orbifold y f has the unfolding y g when y is a curve such an unfolding exists except when y p 1 and consists of one or two punctures with different multiplicities in the general case such unfoldings exist locally on y but not globally in general m kapovitch explained me a very beautiful construction in dimension two for orbifolds of general type 1 3 the kodaira dimension of a fibration 1 3 1 kodaira dimension define now in general for f x 99 ky a fibration between irre ducible compact complex spaces x and y y f inf y f where f x y ranges over all holomorphic fibrations f between manifolds x and y which are equivalent to f we call y f the kodaira dimension of the fibration f notice indeed that this notion depends only on the equivalence class of f definition 1 6 we shall say that f x y is admissible if it is holomorphic with x y smooth and if y f y ky f we shall see in section 1 4 that neat fibrations are admissible in 1 12 we shall see that any f x y is admissible if y 0 notice that it follows from 1 7 right below that if f dominates f and if f is admissible so is f 12 fre de ric campana 1 3 2 generically finite maps we consider a commutative diagram of holomorphic surjec tive maps between compact irreducible normal complex spaces x u f x f y v y we assume moreover that f f are holomorphic fibrations and u v generically finite and such that f u v f theorem 1 7 let f x y and f x y be two holomorphic fibrations and let holomorphic maps u x x and v y y such that f u v f be given 1 assume also that u v are bimeromorphic then a y f u y f and y f y f b if moreover y 0 then equality holds and y f y f 2 assume that u and v are generically finite and surjective then a y f y f b y f y f if u is e tale and x x are smooth we shall prove theorem 1 7 as a consequence of several lemmas some of independent interest a different shorter proof of 1 7 will be given in section 1 4 below lemma 1 8 assume u v bimeromorphic then a f u f and so y f u y f b f v f e for some q divisor e supported on the exceptional locus of v therefore v f f and y f y f proof a for any d y using notations of 1 1 4 we have f u d u f d u j d f mj dj r j j d f u mj dj rj u r where dj is the strict transform by u of dj and rj is the u exceptional part of u dj obviously u r is f u exceptional for each component rjk of rj its multiplicity in f u d is divisible by mj by the above equalities and the factoriality of the smooth x thus m d f u m d f and f u f as claimed observe that rjk does not need to be f u exceptional in general b by a we can and shall assume that x x to ease notations let d y be an irreducible divisor and let d v d we just need to show that m d f m d f if d is not u exceptional that is if d is a divisor of y then v d d e with e an effective v exceptional divisor of y thus j d f mj dj r f d f d f e now observe that f e is f exceptional and that each dj is mapped surjectively onto d by f and so must be surjectively mapped to d by f thus j d f mj dj j d f mj d j and we get the claim we thus get the first assertion of b the others easily follow from it write e e e with e and e effective and v exceptional we thus get y f y ky v e y v y and so the conclusion special varieties and classification theory 13 remark 1 9 modifications of x thus don t alter y f but modifications of the base may let it decrease see the example below which shows that strict inequality can actually occur in theorem 1 7 example 1 10 probably the simplest example is when y p 2 and red is a union of 2 k 6 distinct lines meeting at one point a p 2 corresponding fibrations are easily constructed as follows let p y y be the double cover branched exactly along red and h the involution of y exchanging the sheets of p let e be an elliptic curve and t a translation of order 2 of e let x e y j t h the diagonal involution of x and x 0 x g where g is the group of order 2 generated by j let f 0 x 0 y and f x y be the induced holomorphic fibrations let d x x 0 be a desingularisation induced by a desingularisation of y for example and f d f 0 x y then f 1 2 red and so y f resp 0 resp 2 if k 2 resp k 3 resp k 4 on the other hand let v y y be the blow up of a p 2 let e be its exceptional divisor and f x y be the lifting of the meromorphic map v 1 f x y to a suitable modification x of x an easy local computation for example shows that f the strict transform of f by v this is just because the normalisation of y y y does not ramify over the generic point of e we thus conclude that y f whatever k 1 because ky f k 3 v h e 2 e if h is the hyperplane line bundle on y and v h e defines the unique ruling of y in particular y f y f if k 3 finally we observe that the same construction does not lead to this last strict inequality when f is a normal crossing divisor but such other examples should exist corollary 1 11 let f x 99 ky a fibration between irreducible compact complex spaces x and y 1 there exists f x y an admissible holomorphic model of f between manifolds x and y and bimeromorphic maps u x x and v y y such that f u v f 2 for any x bimeromorphic to x there exists u x x bimeromorphic and f x y a holomorphic admissible and prepared model of f between manifolds x and y such that any effective divisor b x which is f exceptional is also u exceptional proof it is an easy application of hironaka smoothing and hironaka raynaud flattening theorems 1 first take an admissible model f x y of f modify y to y smooth and dominating y making base change by y over y and smoothing x y y we get the fibration f with the desired properties 2 start with the previous fibration f we can first modify x so that the new x dominates any given bimeromorphic model of x then flatten the new f by modifying y to get y smooth and the non smooth locus of f contained in a divisor of normal crossings as before make base change of y over y and smooth x y y to obtain a fibration f x y enjoying the claimed properties proposition 1 12 assume that y 0 in lemma 1 8 above then y f y f y f 14 fre de ric campana in other words any holomorphic model of f is then admissible proof because y is smooth using the notations of the proof of lemma 1 8 we have v f be f f for some nonnegative rational number b with f denoting the strict transform of f by v also here e denotes the reduced exceptional divisor of the map v and the inequality d d between two q divisors d d on y means that their difference d d is an effective q divisor moreover we have ky v ky ae for some strictly positive rational number a here we use the smoothness of y but y having just terminal singularities would be sufficient we can thus write as q divisors ky f v ky ae v f be v ky f a b e we are thus finished if a b 0 so we now assume the contrary a b 1 from be v f f we get first ae a b be a b v f f and then f a e a b v f 1 a b f from which we deduce ky f v ky f ae d with d a b v ky f 1 a b v ky f a b v ky f where the last inequality follows from our assumption that y 0 lemma 1 13 let the situation be as in theorem 1 7 above assume u and v are generically finite and surjective then y f y f proof we need only to show that for any admissible f as above we can find a holomorphic representative f 0 x 0 y 0 of f with y 0 f 0 y f because then y f y 0 f 0 y f y f modifying x x y and y we can and shall thus assume f to be admissible let v v v be the stein factorisation of v with v y y connected hence bimeromorphic v y y finite and y normal we also denote here with f f f 0 f 0 the relevant multiplicity divisors for the corresponding fibrations f f f v f f 0 let now w y y o be a modification and define f 0 w f w v f wo w v y y 0 the relevant diagram is the following x f 0 u f f b b b b b b b b x f y v v w 0 a a a a a a a a y v w y y 0 lemma 1 14 we can and shall further assume modifying y x and x y if needed that such a w exists with f o admissible equivalent to f proof indeed this existence follows from the next lemma applied to our initial y 0 y 0 in place of v u where f 0 dominates f 0 which means there exists g h such that f 0 h g f 0 and f 0 x 0 y 0 is equivalent to f with g y 0 y 0 and h x 0 x 0 generically finite special varieties and classification theory 15 lemma 1 15 let r v u be generically finite surjective between irreducible normal compact complex spaces there exist modifications n v v and m u u such that 1 s m 1 r n v u is holomorphic 2 if s r r is the stein factorisation of s then there exists a holomorphic factorisation n v v of m r v u through r ie r n m r here r v v is connected and r v u is finite we can assume v and u to be smooth the relevant diagram is the following v n r s b b b b b b b b v r n v r u m u proof just flatten the map r by suitably modifying u to complete the proof of 1 13 we shall next need the following two properties a b a we then have because v is finite a ky v ky r an equality between weil divisors and r effective to see this observe we may first assume that f is deduced from f by base change by v and smoothing of a main component this is simply because f u f if y y and u is generically finite the argument is the same as in 1 8 next a simple computation in local analytic coordinates over the generic point y of y shows that if r is the ramification order of v at y and m is the multiplicity of the fibre of f over y v y then the multiplicity of the f fibre over y is m m d if d gcd r m and r r d for this we need to choose y lying outside the codimension two analytic subset of y consisting of points y which are either singular on y or mapped by v to a point y v y either singular on f s or with f fibre of nongeneric multiplicity where s v s with s the weil divisor of points of y at which v ramifies from this we see that near y on y we have ky v ky 1 1 r r 1 1 m 1 r d with r v r s r the reduced ramification divisor of v near y and d the unique reduced component of near y if r or d is empty our equality a is obvious otherwise r d by our choice of y and a follows from the inequality 1 1 m 1 1 m r 1 1 m r 1 1 r 1 1 m 1 r b moreover we also have quite generally ky v ky this is an immediate check from the initial constructions made we thus know that f 0 is admissible and dominates f 0 admissible in the sense just before the lemma we then get ky v ky v ky r hence ky 0 0 w ky w v ky r w 0 v ky r 16 fre de ric campana and so y f y 0 ky 0 0 y 0 w 0 v ky y v ky y ky y f as claimed in 1 13 the proof of which is thus complete the last property asserted in theorem 1 7 is lemma 1 16 let the situation be as in theorem 1 7 above assume now that u x x is e tale ie unramified then y f y f proof by lemma 1 13 we need only to show that y f y f for any f f as above we can assume f to be admissible and still u to be e tale indeed just replace x by x 1 x x x 1 if m x 1 x is a modification having an admissible fibration f 1 x 1 y 1 equivalent to f then x 1 is smooth and u 1 x 1 x 1 is e tale the stein factorisation f 1 x 1 y 1 of f 1 u 1 x 1 y 1 does not need to have y 1 smooth but a modification m x 2 x 1 of x 1 allows to assume this to be true accordingly modifying y 1 now the birational invariance of the fundamental group for complex manifolds shows that x 2 may be assumed after further modification to be of the form x x x 2 for some modification x 2 of x let us check this we can indeed assume that u x 1 x x is galois of group g and that f is the connected part of the stein factorisation of f u the map v y y is thus g equivariant as well but then the modification m x 2 x 1 can be assumed to be also g equivariant which shows that x 2 is obtained from u by base change over a modification of x this establishes our preliminary claim that f can be chosen admissible next by stein factorisation of v v v we see as in the above proof of lemma 1 7 that it is sufficient to show that ky v ky that is r is empty because then ky v ky and so ky v ky e for some v exceptional not necessarily effective q divisor e of y which implies the desired reverse inequality by the finiteness of the map v the equality has only to be shown near any point y y lying outside a codimension two subset s of y we can thus assume that y is a generic point on some component of the support of f let us now cut y by divisors in general position through y we are reduced to the case when y is a curve the argument being local on y in the analytic topology we don t need any algebraicity assumption of y but then an easy local computation see c 98 for example shows that for any y y the order of ramification r of v at y divides the multiplicity m of the fibre xy of f over y v y the multiplicity m of the fibre x y of f over y is thus m m r since u is e tale we now compute ky near y ky v ky 1 1 r y 1 1 m y v ky 1 1 r 1 r 1 1 m y v ky 1 1 m y as claimed here y is the reduced divisor on the curve y supported by the point y 1 4 the sheaf of differential forms determined by a fibration definition 1 17 let x c be smooth and let f x 99 ky be a meromorphic fibration with y reduced but not necessarily smooth the rank one coherent subsheaf ff of p x p dim y is defined as the saturation in p x of f ky 0 if y 0 is the smoot locus of y special varieties and classification theory 17 let us remark that the subsheaf ff so defined is a bimeromorphic invariant it is preserved not only under modifications of x but also under modifications of y in other words ff depends only on the equivalence class of f we define by f its kodaira dimension let us make more precise what is understood by x ff for m 0 define h 0 x fm to be the complex vector space of sections of the subsheaf of p x m which coincides with f mf over the zariski open subset of x with codimension two or more complement over which ff is locally free then define in the usual way to see the usual property of being an integer or notice that the data are bimeromor phically invariant on x so that ff can be considered as the injective image of some locally free rank one sheaf l on x after some suitable modification the claimed property is then obvious since it holds for l we can then always implicitely assume the existence of l in the sequel and also the holomorphic character of any meromorphic map defined on x such as for example the ones defined by linear systems l m we shall now describe ff in more detail definition 1 18 in the preceding situation define f f f kx ox f f where the symbol used is the usual round up defined as applied to the coefficients of the irreducible components of the effective q divisor under consideration here is the integral part of course definition 1 19 let f x y be a holomorphic fibration and s an effective divisor on x we say that s is partially suported on the fibres of f if f s 6 y and if t is any irreducible component of f s of codimension one in y then f 1 t contains an irreducible component mapped on t by f but not contained in the support of s observe that if s is partially supported on the fibres of f so are its positive multiples the introduction of this notion is due to the following lemma 1 20 let f x y be a fibration and s a divisor of x partially supported on the fibres of f let l be a line bundle on y the natural injection of sheaves l f f l s is an isomorphism proof the assertion is of local nature on y so we can assume that l is trivial we then just need to show that f ox s oy we assume that s f oy t for some effective divisor t on y local sections of the the sheaf on the right are of the form f u t where u is holomorphic on y while t is a local equation of t the sections of the sheaf on the left are meromorphic functions on x of the same form but with poles contained in s because s is partially supported on the fibres of f we get the claim t divides u we apply this to the following situation proposition 1 21 let f x y be a holomorphic fibration between manifolds there exists a zariski closed subset a y of codimension at least 2 such that f f s and ff are naturally isomorphic over x b f 1 y a where s x is an effective divisor partially supported on the fibres of f 18 fre de ric campana proof let a be the union of the singular set of the support of f and of images of all f exceptional divisors on x let us remark that the above natural isomorphism is immediate outside of because if t y is a one codimensional component of the locus of non smooth fibres of f then f 1 t contains a reduced component at the generic point of which f is smooth so we consider the situation near a smooth point of some i not lying in a in suitable local coordinates at the generic point of dij in the notations of the lines preceding 1 1 4 we have x x 1 xn and y y 1 yp with f x y 1 x mij 1 y 2 x 2 yp xp and so f ky f is generated by x mij mi 1 1 d x with d x dx 1 dxp a simple check shows that this is exactly the claim one may even observe that the divisor s has the same description as the one given to define f f by adding to the one codimensional components of the locus of non smooth fibres of f corollary 1 22 let f x y be a fibration as in 1 21 above let m 0 be a sufficiently divisible integer then 1 the natural isomorphism between f f s and ff over x b extends to a natural injection of h 0 x f m f into h 0 x m f f s h 0 y m ky f 2 if f is neat this injection is bijective proof 1 we start by observing that by 1 20 the bijection h 0 x m f f s h 0 y m ky f actually holds the natural map at the level of sections of m th powers induces an isomorphism over a codimen sion two subset of y because m ky f is locally free on y the said isomorphism thus extends as an injection by hartog s theorem 2 this is because b is mapped to a codimension two or more zariski closed subset of x if u x x is a modification with x smooth and sending the f exceptional divisors of x in codimension 2 or more in x then the sections of m f f s over x b extend to sections of f m f as claimed we now have the following easy but important consequence proposition 1 23 let f x y be a holomorphic fibration with x y smooth then 1 f y f 2 f y f if f is neat see 1 2 for this notion 3 f y f proof 1 and 2 are simply restatements of 1 22 we deduce 3 by choosing a neat admissible model f of f then f y f y f this allows us to give a short proof of the basic properties shown in theorem 1 7 corollary 1 24 the statements of theorem 1 7 hold proof using the notations there we have a natural inclusion u ff ff which is an equality if u is e tale the conclusions follow from the standard properties of the kodaira dimension remark that one can also use the sheaves ff to simplify some of the geometric proofs given in section 2 2 special varieties and classification theory 19 1 5 semi continuity of the kodaira dimension proposition 1 25 let f x y and g y z be holomorphic fibrations with x a connected compact complex manifold and h g f let z be the zariski open subset of z over which g and h are smooth let for z z denote by fz xz yz the restriction of f to the z fiber xz of h mapped by f to the z fibre yz of g then 1 there exist modifications x x and y y such that f z is admissible for z general in z with f 1 f holomorphic 2 let d inf yz fz z z so that d 0 1 dim y dim z then d yz fz for z general in z 3 let a be the set of points z of z such that yz fz dim y dim z then either a contains the general point of z or a is contained in a countable union of closed proper analytic subsets of z proof we don t mention modifications of x since they don t change the kodaira dimensions of fibrations with x as domain for any modification y y and d 0 1 dim y dim z let s d z z such that yz f z d from gr 60 and as in 5 l s we deduce that s d sd z where sd is a countable union of zariski closed subsets of z obviously sd 1 sd for any and d this on z at least which is sufficient for our purposes if y y dominates in the sense that there exists a y y with then obviously by theorem 1 7 sd sd we can thus define for any d sd z as the intersection of all sd s it is again a countable intersection of zariski closed subsets of z define now d max d such that sd z there thus exists some such that sd 1 6 z both claims then follow immediately from the constructions just made the third assertion is an immediate consequence of the second 1 6 composition of fibrations this section will not be used before section 4 assume now x y z to be smooth and f x y and g y z to be holomorphic fibrations our aim is to define if h is an orbifold structure on y ie an effective q divisor on y with components having multiplicities of the form 1 1 m for m integer an orbifold structure g h on z in such a way that we have the equality g h g f when h f if f x y is sufficiently high in a sense defined in section 4 below let us recall how we defined multiplicities for any irreducible divisor d z the multiplicity m g d of g along d is m g d inf mj j j g d where g d j j g d mj dj is the union of all components counted with their scheme theoretic multiplicities of g d which are mapped surjectively onto d by g and j g d is the set of these components let if d y is an irreducible divisor of y mapped by g to a divisor d g d z m g d be the multiplicity of d in g d thus m g d j j g d m g dj dj we shall now define the notion of orbifold base of a fibration g y h z when the domain of the fibration is itself an orbifold y h but g y z is just a usual fibration with z smooth 20 fre de ric campana writingh i i 1 1 mi hi define for any irreducible reduced divisord y its muliplicity m h d in h as being mi if d hi and being 1 otherwise ie if d is not a component of the support of h for any irreducible divisor d z with z smooth define next the multiplicity m g h d of g y h z along d by m g h d infj j g d m g dj m h dj and finally definition 1 26 let g y z be a fibration with z smooth let h be an orbifold structure on y we define the orbifold base g h of the fibration g y h z by g h d z 1 1 m g h d d in general it is not true that g h g f if h f but the following results at least are available proposition 1 27 let f x y and g y z be two holomorphic fibrations with x y z smooth then g f g f recall that for two q divisors a b on a variety z we write a b if b a is effective proof we easily check that we have for any prime divisor d z m g f d infj j g d m g dj m f dj by definition and m g f d infk j g f d m g f dk also by definition now if f dk dj is a divisor then m g f dk m g dj m f dj by an easy check observe that the minimum of these values taken over j g d is precisely m g f d thus m g f d inf m g f d m f g where m f g infk j g f d m g f dk and where j g f d is the set of irreducible components of g f d which are surjectively mapped to d by g f but are f exceptional from this the claim follows observe that strict inequality may thus occur however proposition 1 28 let f g be two fibrations as above let f x y be a modification of f with modifications u x x and v y y such that f u v f then 1 g f g f with g g v 2 g f g f 3 there exists a modification f of f such that g f g f for any modification f of f 4 if f is a modification as in 3 above then g f g f 5 in 3 above we can choose f such that moreover f g and g f are prepared admissible and high proof 1 g f g f u so the claim follows from 1 7 2 we can and shall thus assume that x x and f v f let d z be a prime divisor then j g d j g d the difference consisting of the v exceptional components of g d moreover for each j j g d we have m g dj m g dj with dj the strict transform of dj by v finally m f dj m f dj by 1 7 this implies the claim special varieties and classification theory 21 3 this is simply because there are only finitely many orbifold divisors on z lying between g f and g f and because of 1 and 2 above which show that the first resp second term is invariant resp decreases under a modification 4 assume indeed that f rather than f to ease notations enjoys the property stated in 3 assume we have g f g f this means that there exists an f exceptional prime divisor d x such that g f d d z is a divisor in z and that the multiplicity m of d in g f d is equal to m g f d and is so strictly less than m g f d take a modification f of f such that the strict transform of d in x is no longer f exceptional the multiplicity of d the strict transform of d in x is then m by an easy check thus m g f d m m g f d but this contradicts the property 3 supposed to hold for f contradiction the claim follows 5 by modifying z we can assume that g f and g are admissible high and moreover that the non smooth loci of these two fibrations are contained in a normal crossings divisor by modifying next y we can assume that g is prepared f admissible and high and that the non smooth locus of f is contained in a normal crossings divisor of y finally modify x to get the remaining stated properties 2 special fibrations and general type fibrations 2 1 special or general type fibrations definition 2 1 let f x 99 ky be a fibration with x y compact irreducible 1 the fibration f x 99 ky is said to be of general type if y f dim y 0 2 the variety x is said to be special if x c and if there is no meromorphic fibration f x 99 ky of general type for any y 3 the fibration f x 99 ky is said to be special if x c and if its general fibre is special recall that here c is the class of compact complex spaces x which are bimeromorphic to or equivalently dominated by some compact ka hler manifold x depending on x this class was introduced by a fujiki recall see c 81 also that a point of a complex space y is said to be general if it lies outside of a countable union of closed analytic subsets of y none of which containing any irreducible component of y similarly if f x y is a fibration one of its fibres xy is general if it lies above a general point y of y example 2 2 we list proofs need tools developed below and so are given later some examples of special manifolds 0 a variety of general type and positive dimension is not special consider its identity map it is a fibration of general type 1 a curve is special iff its genus is 0 or 1 iff its kodaira dimension is at most zero iff its fundamental group is abelian iff it is not hyperbolic this because a curve has only the two trivial fibrations constant and identity the two fondamental examples of special manifolds are direct generalisations 22 fre de ric campana 2 a manifold which is rationally connected is special see theorem 3 21 for a geometric proof and definition of the notions involved another shorter but more abstract proof of the specialness of rationally connected manifolds is given 2 27 below 3 a manifold x with vanishing kodaira dimension ie x 0 is special see theorem 5 1 for the proof another proof is given in 2 27 in the special case where c 1 x 0 4 more generally special manifolds are conjectured to be build up from manifolds either ra tionally connected or with kodaira dimension zero by suitable compositions of fibrations with fibres of these two types see section 6 4 for a precise formulation 5 for any d 0 and k 0 d 1 there exists projective manifolds of dimension d and kodaira dimension k see 2 18 for such examples 6 a manifold x c is special if there exists a nondegenerate meromorphic map from cn to x where nondegenerate means submersive at some point where it is holomorphic for example a complex torus or a projective space are special this follows also from 2 3 above as well see theorem 8 2 for the proof of a more general version 7 ka hler manifolds with nef anticanonical bundle are conjectured to be special this con jecture implies most usual conjectures concerning these manifolds see d p s zh pa 8 a manifold x of algebraic dimension zero denoted a x 0 to mean that all mero morphic functions on x are constant so that meromorphic maps from x to projective varieties are constant is also special simply because any meromorphic map from x onto a projective manifold is constant 9 more generally see u chap 12 for the notions used theorem 2 3 let ax x alg x be the algebraic reduction of x c the generic fibre of ax is special recall that the algebraic dimension of x denoted a x is the dimension of alg x and also the transcendance degree over c of the field of meromorphic functions on x one says that x is moishezon if a x dim x this also means that x has a modification which is projective the proof of the preceding result is given in 2 38 below question 2 4 two important stability properties of the class of special manifolds are expected to hold but are not proved in the present paper the stability under deformation and specialisation do these hold 2 2 special fibrations dominate general type fibrations the geometric study of spe cial manifolds is based on theorem 2 11 stated and proved below its proof rests on several preliminary resuts of independent interest that we now give lemma 2 5 let g x x be meromorphic surjective ie dominant assume that x is special then x is special too proof assume first that g is connected ie a fibration let if any f x y be a fibration of general type we can assume that f g x y is admissible then obviously f g f e for some effective divisor e y because m f g d m f d for any irreducible divisor special varieties and classification theory 23 d y thus f g is of general type too a contradiction no such f does exist which is what was claimed in the general case stein factorise g and use the first part to reduce to the case where g is generically finite if f as in the first part exists then we deduce from 1 7 that the fibration part of the stein factorisation of f g also is of general type hence again a contradiction proposition 2 6 let f x y be a fibration of general type let j z x be holomorphic such that f j z y is surjective let f j g h be the stein factorisation of f j with h z y connected and g y y finite then h is a fibration of general type in particular if dim z dim y we get corollary 2 7 let f x y be a fibration of general type let j z x be meromorphic and such that f j z y surjective then z is a variety of general type proof of 2 6 and 2 7 assume first that f j z y is connected and admissible as we can then for any component i of f we have restricting to components surjectively mapped onto i by f j f j i j f i j mi di mi j di thus f j f e for some effective q divisor e of y and f j is thus of general type in this case we now consider the general case define f x x y y y be deduced from the base change by g and smoothing of the fibre product the map j lifts meromorphically to j z y by construction because f j is surjective but now f j z y is a fibration applying the first part we get the claim for 2 7 notice that in this situation h is bimeromorphic and of general type by 2 6 thus z is itself of general type as claimed example 2 8 we can now give two elementary examples of special varieties 1 pn c is special 2 a product of special varieties is special proof indeed for 1 let f pn c 99 ky be any general type fibration if any let m dim y 0 choose j z pm c pn c such that f j is surjective to contradict 2 6 the proof of 2 is similar we shall prove more general results in section 3 proposition 2 9 let f x y and k y w be fibrations assume that f is of general type then fw xw yw is also of general type for w w general proof let w w be general and recall that fw xw yw is nothing but the restriction of f to xw but then fw f yw ew with ew effective and empty for generic w in w moreover kyw ky yw by adjunction thus kyw fw ky f yw for general w now ky f is big thus so is its restriction to yw by modifying adequately x and y we can assume that fw is admissible by the following lemma we thus get the claimed property lemma 2 10 let f x y and g y z be fibrations there exists representatives of f and g also denoted f and g such that fz is admissible for z z general 24 fre de ric campana proof this is a special case of 1 25 the main result in this section is theorem 2 11 let h v 99 kz and f x 99 ky be fibrations with f of general type and h having general fibres which are special let g v 99 kx be meromorphic surjective then there exists k z y such that f g k h the situation is described in the following commutative diagram v g h special x f gen type z k y the special case v x deserves special mention theorem 2 12 let h x 99 kz and f x y be fibrations with f of general type and h special then there exists k z y such that f g k h we say that h dominates f the corresponding diagram is x f gen type h special z k y remark 2 13 the special case where x y is of general type is obvious by the easy addition theorem because the covering family of y by the subvarieties h xz has a generic member of general type these subvarieties must be points proof of 2 11 this is a direct consequence of 2 14 below indeed if such a map k does not exist then f g vz is positive dimensional for generic z z but the stein factorisation of f gz is then of general type by 2 14 this contradicts the assumption that g is special proposition 2 14 let f x y and h v z be fibrations assume f is of general type let g v x be a surjective meromorphic map let gz vz yz be the restriction of f g to vz with yz hz vz assume yz is positive dimensional then the stein factorisation of gz is of general type for z general in z proof by 2 9 we can then replace x by v and f by f g without losing the hypothesis that g g is of general type both when g is generically finite or is a fibration we thus see that the connected part of the stein factorisation f of f g is a fibration of general type replace x by v and f by f so that we are reduced to the case where x v and f f g which we now treat we then notice that we can replace z by any subvariety z z going through a general point of z and x by x x defined by x g 1 z provided f x y this is because of 2 9 which shows that the stein factorisation of the restriction of f to x is still of general type we shall then construct an appropriate z z let c z c y be the meromorphic map sending a generic z z to the reduced cycle of y supported on yz here c y denotes the chow scheme of y observe next that f being of special varieties and classification theory 25 general type y is moishezon by modifying suitably y we shall assume that y is projective let w c x be the image of z by c thus w is projective too we next choosew w to be an intersection of generic members of any very ample linear system on w in such a way that the incidence graph y w y of the algebraic family of cycles of y parametrised by w is generically finite over y this means that if p y y and q y w are induced by the natural projections then p is generically finite surjective more concretely the generic point of y is contained in only finitely many of the yw s for w w define now z c 1 w remark that when z is moishezon we don t need to consider c and can just take intersections of ample divisors of a projective modification of z directly we now replace x z g f respectively by x z and their restrictions to x lemma 2 15 p y y is bimeromorphic proof let c be the restriction of the above map c to z then y w y is the image of c h f x w y thus f x y lifts to f x y such that p f f because p is generically finite and f connected we see that p is bimeromorphic we have by construction q f c h x w we now can conclude by applying successively 2 9 and 2 7 to xw for w general in w indeed from 2 9 we learn that the restriction fw xw yw of f to xw is of general type further for z generic in c 1 w z w we know that f xz f xw yw and so by 2 7 the stein factorisation of the restriction of f to xz is of general type as claimed corollary 2 16 let f x 99 ky be a special fibration and let j z x be such that f j z 99 ky is onto assume that z is special then x is special proof let h x 99 kw be a fibration of general type if any by 2 11 with v x there is a factorisation k y w such that h k f thus j h z w is onto we can thus apply 2 7 which says that the stein factorisation h z w of h j z w is of general type but z being special by assumption this is a contradiction and x is special remark 2 17 it is not true true in general that x is special if it admits a special fibration f x y with y special see 1 1 for example but in some cases if the fibres are for example rationally connected this is true see 3 28 example 2 18 for any d 0 and k 0 d 1 there exists projective manifolds of dimension d and kodaira dimension k in particular it is not true that a special manifold has nonpositive kodaira dimension to get examples with k 0 just take indeed a general member of the linear system op d k 2 m on p pd k 1 pk for large m and such that this member has a section over the base pk if k just take pd we now come to a very important consequence of 2 12 corollary 2 19 let x c there is at most one fibration defined on x which is both special and of general type if it exists this fibration special and is dominated by any other special 26 fre de ric campana fibration defined on x it is also moreover of general type and dominates any other general type fibration defined on x the proof is immediate from 2 12 in other words such a fibration is the lowest special and the highest of general type on x the existence of such a fibration on any x is the main result of tis paper these two descriptions provide us with two means of construction by consideration of chains of special subvarieties one geometrically constructs the lowest special fibration on any x this is the way used in section 3 dually by making fibre products of general type fibrations one constructs the highest general type fibration on x this is the approach followed in section 5 in both cases to show that the fibration so constructed has the missing property special if general type and conversely we need the orbifold additivity result 4 4 recall now definition 2 20 let f x y be a surjective meromorphic map between normal compact irre ducible analytic complex spaces we say that f is almost holomorphic if f j 6 y where j is the indeterminacy locus of f more precisely if x x y is the graph of f and f x y the restriction of the second projection then f j f j with j being the set of all x x such that p 1 x does not reduce to x or equivalently is positive dimensional here p x x is the first projection which is a proper modification and x p x theorem 2 21 let f x y be a meromorphic fibration of general type with x c smooth then f is almost holomorphic remark 2 22 the smoothness assumption is essential as shown by the example of the cone x over a projective manifold of general type y the conclusion of the preceding theorem should however hold if the singularities of x are terminal or even canonical proof resolve the indeterminacies of f by a sequence of smooth blow ups u x x by h hironaka s results with f f u x y holomorphic if f is not almost holomorphic some irreducible component v of the exceptional divisor of u is mapped surjectively onto y by f in such a way that the fibres vz of the restriction u of u to v are mapped to positive dimensional subvarieties f vz of y this contradicts 2 14 because v has two maps u v z u d x and f v y the restriction of f to v now by smoothness of x u is special its generic fibre is a rational variety so apply 2 8 moreover by 2 7 f is of general type possibly after stein factorisation from 2 14 we thus have a factorisation z y with f u but this precisely contradicts dim f vz 0 and we get the claim 2 3 general type fibrations and bogomolov sheaves definition 2 23 let x c a rank one coherent subsheaf f of px p 0 is said to be a p dimensional bogomolov sheaf on x if x f p the properties of these kodaira dimensions have been discussed in section 1 4 to which we thus refer special varieties and classification theory 27 by the results of that section any equivalence class of a general type fibration f defined on x canonically determines a bogomolov sheaf ff on x we shall now see the converse direction by the results of bo any p dimensional bogomolov sheaf determines a meromorphic fibration ff x yf with dim yf p and such that f f f kyf at the generic point of yf the proof given there applies only tox projective because of the argument of cutting by transver sal hyperplane sections but as is well known can be easily modified to apply to any x compact ka hler or in c as follows theorem 2 24 bo 79 let f px p 0 be a bogomolov sheaf on x c let ff x yf be the fibration defined by the linear system l m for m 0 sufficiently large and divisible we can assume that f is holomorphic then f f f kyf at the generic point of yf proof we can using the covering trick argument of bo 79 reduce to the case when m 1 which we now treat we can thus select p 1 sections si i 0 1 p of f which are analytically independent ie the linear system they define is ff up to stein factorisation and so has p dimensional image because f has rank one there exists meromorphic functions yi i 1 p such that si yi s 0 by hodge theory x being ka hler or even just in c the holomorphic p forms si i 0 p on x are closed from which we get ds 0 dyi s 0 0 i 1 p the last equality shows by simple algebraic arguments the existence of a meromorphic function g on x such that s 0 g dy 1 dyp the first equality shows that g f h for some meromorphic function h on y and so the claim since the argument applies to i 0 as well we can thus sum up the preceding observations as follows theorem 2 25 notations being as above for any x c there are inverse bijective correspon dances between bogomolov sheaves f on x and eqivalence classes of general type fibrations f defined on x these correspondances are defined as fillows 1 if f is of general type then ff is a bogomolov sheaf on x 2 if f is a bogomolov sheaf on x then ff is a fibration of general type a direct application and motivation is theorem 2 26 the manifold x c is special if and only if there is no bogomolov sheaf on x proof the bogomolov subsheaves on x correspond bijectively to fibrations of general type with domain x corollary 2 27 the manifold x is special in the following two cases 1 x is rationally connected see section 3 3 for this notion 2 x is a compact ka hler manifold with trivial or torsion canonical bundle or even more generally if c 1 x 0 proof in both cases it is shown in c 95 that x 0 which means in particular that a coherent rank one subsheaf of p x p 0 has kodaira dimension negative or zero thus x has no bogomolov subsheaf it is thus special by 2 26 the result in c 95 depends on calabi yau s theorem but in the projective case one can get algebro geometric proofs using miyaoka s generic semi positivity theorem 28 fre de ric campana we shall see later that the weaker condition x 0 is actually sufficient for x to be special notice that the property shown in c 95 in the above two cases is considerably stronger than the absence of bogomolov sheaves this is not surprising in view of the fact that these manifolds are the building blocks of the class of special manifolds but do not exhaust this class by far 2 4 general type reduction 2 4 1 ordering of fibrations recall from 1 1 2 that a meromorphic fibration f x 99 ky canonically defines see c 85 a meromorphic map f y c x with c x the chow scheme of x by sending the generic y y to the point of c x parametrising the reduced fibre xy of f over y let f c x be the image of y by f it is a compact irreducible analytic subset of c x bimeromorphic to y such that its incidence graph is bimeromorphic to y the above correspondance induces a bijective map between equivalence classes of fibrations and compact irreducible analytic subsets of c x with incidence graph bimeromorphic to x recall also we said that f is almost holomorphic if the image by f naturally defined using the graph of f of the indeterminacy locus i f of f is not all of y see 2 20 for details it is easy to show that f is an irreducible component of c x if f is almost holomorphic see c 85 we now introduce an order on the set of equivalence classes of fibrations with domain x we say that f dominates the fibration g x z if there exists a meromorhic fibration y 99 kz such that g f equivalently each fibre of f is contained in some fibre of g this binary relation defines an ordering on the set f x of all equivalence classes of fibrations seen as a subset of c c x there is now an easy lemma 2 28 if f x is any subset it has in the ordered set f x a least upper bound denoted proof is so constructed let 0 1 n be finite such that the product map f f 1 f n has an image of maximal dimension then take for the fibration part of the stein factorisation of f finally the preceding construction shows that if any element of is almost holomorphic so is the least upper bound of the family example 2 29 if consists of fibrations onto varieties of general type then is also a fibration onto a variety of general type this is easily reduced to the case when has two elements and then reduces to showing that if z y y is a subvariety of a product of two varieties of general type then z itself is of general type if it is mapped surjectively to y y by the first and second projections this results easily from the additivity theorem for fibrations with base of general type generalised orbifold versions will be proved in section 4 below definition 2 30 for any x c let gtx x 99 kgt x be the least upper bound in f x of the family x of all equivalence classes of fibrations of general type fj x 99 kyj if x is special we just take for gtx the constant fibration we call gtx the general type reduction of x special varieties and classification theory 29 from 2 4 1 above we deduce proposition 2 31 for any x c smooth the map gtx x gt x is almost holomorphic question 2 32 let x c is gtx either constant or a fibration of general type this question has a positive answer if so does the next one question 2 33 let u x u and v x v be fibrations of general type is then f x w of general type if so are u and v here f is the stein factorisation of the product map u v x w with w u v x u v it is obvious that if 2 33 has a positive answer so does 2 32 by the construction of gtx we shall see in 5 17 that these two questions have an affirmative answer but this answer rests on the very different techniques of section 4 theorem 2 34 let x c and f x 99 ky be any fibration then f admits a relative gt reduction this means that there exists a unique factorisation f h g of f by fibrations h z 99 ky and g x 99 kz such that for y general in y the restriction gy xy 99 kzy of g to xy is the gt reduction of xy proof this construction is actually in essence already in c 8 o to which we refer for more details we can and shall assume that x is smooth and f holomorphic due to the bimeromorphic invariance of the notions involved we shall actually show a more precise version lemma 2 35 let f x y be a fibration with x c after a generically base change v y y and proper modifications that we notationally ignore there exists finitely many factorisations f hi gi i 1 2 n with gi x zi hi zi y such that 1 the restriction gi y xy zi y of each gi to the general fibre xy of f is of general type 2 if g x z is the fibration part of the stein factorisation of the product map g 1 gn x z 1 y z 2 zn 1 y zn then the restriction g xy xy zy of g to the general fibre xy of f coincides with the gt reduction gtxy xy g xy of that fibre proof let for y y gty xy zy be the gt reduction of xy where y is the zariski open subset of z over which f is smooth for such a y let z y be the family of fibres of gty defined as the image of the meromorphic map from zy to c xy sending a generic point of zy to the point in c xy parametrising its reduced gty fibre in xy because gty is an almost holomorphic map by 2 21 z y is an irreducible component of c xy consider now the zariski closed subset c x y of c x consisting of cycles contained in some fibre of f it is naturally equipped with the holomorphic map fy c x y y sending such a cycle to the fibre containing it strictly speaking one may need to weakly normalise first to make f holomorphic but this does not change the argument because x c the irreducible components of c x y are compact 30 fre de ric campana assume the fibre of f is not special for y in a subset of y which is of second category in baire s terminology being of second category means not contained in a countable union of closed subsets with empty interior as we shall see later the right topology here in our context is the zariski topology not the metric topology because x c the irreducible components of c x y are compact by the countability at infinity of c x y there is an irreducible component of c x y mapped surjectively onto y by f and such that the f fibre y of over y has a component equal to z y c xy the family of fibres of a fibration of general type gi y xy 99 kz y this map is almost holomorphic by 2 21 the stein factoristation of f restricted to gives a finite base change for y this base changes we shall notationally ignore here because they are irrelevant to our problem so we deal as if the generic fibres of f were irreducible thus for some y y the fibre y of f is the family of fibres of some almost holomorphic meromorphic fibration gi y y xy zy on xy by the obvious openness of almost holo morphicity one deduces the existence of such a y for the generic y y and so using the graph of the family we get a factorisation f with fibrations x z and z y by our assumption y is a fibration of general type for y in s y of second baire category in y from 1 25 we conclude that y is still of general type for y general in y the construction of the gi s is now obvious by observing that if the map g resulting from a finite family of gi s i 1 2 n does not induce gtxy on the general xy there exists by the same argument as above a component inducing a general type fibration on the general xy and such that its stein factorised fibre product over y with the preceding ones will increase the dimension of the resulting z contradiction this shows the lemma and so 2 34 definition 2 36 a subset a v of a complex analytic space is said to be of second zariski category in v if it is not contained in a countable union of zariski closed subsets with empty interior of v notice that the definition makes sense in the algebraico geometric context as well from the proof 2 34 we immediately get corollary 2 37 let f x 99 ky be a fibration with x c assume that dim gt xy d for y a where a is of second zariski category in y then this equality holds for the general point y of y in particular if xy is special for y in a subset of second zariski category in y the general fibre of f is special proof let f h g be the gt reduction of f by assumption dim gt xy d for y a but also dim g xy dim gt xy for y general in y and dim g xy d for y generic in y thus dim gt xy d for y y general 2 5 the algebraic reduction as an application of the preceding arguments we show the orem 2 3 theorem 2 38 let ax x 99 kalg x be the algebraic reduction of x c the generic fibre of ax is special special varieties and classification theory 31 proof assume not by lemma 2 35 above after a suitable finite base change over alg x which we notationally ignore because it preserves the algebraic reduction and dimension there exists a non trivial factorisation ax h g with g a fibration inducing a fibration of general type over the general fibre of ax write it ax h g with g x z and h z alg x then dim z dim alg x by construction the line bundle ky g over z is thus h big thus z is moishezon as one sees considering the line bundle l h k h kz g on z which is big for k a large and positive integer and h an ample line bundle on alg x which we oviously can choose to be projective see for example the proof of u theorem 12 1 but this contradicts the definition of ax and proves the claim 2 6 the category of orbifolds we very briefly discuss without proofs the extension of part of our considerations to orbifolds restricting here to prepared orbifolds y with y smooth and the support of an s n c divisor of y but ultimately one needs to consider klt orbifolds one of the main point is to define bimeromorphic equivalence the right notion seems to be derived from terminal modifications definition 2 39 the bimeromorphic holomorphic map v y y is said to induce a bimero morphic map v y y if it is terminal with respect to the orbifold structures that is if ky v ky j j aj ej where as usual the aj are all positive and j is the collection of v exceptional divisors on y one might also define similarly the notion of canonical modification of course notice that the orbifold kodaira dimension is invariant under bimermorphic equivalence of orb ifold which is the one generated by terminal modifications one can define for any fibration g y z its orbifold base as in 1 6 one can extend this notion to the case of meromorphic g by first resolving the indeterminacies of g by a terminal modification the kodaira dimension of this fibration is then the minimum of the kodaira dimensions of the orbifolds bases of fibrations equivalent to g these being defined on orbifolds y bimeromor phically equivalent to y definition 2 40 the fibration g y z is of general type if its kodaira dimension is dim z 0 the orbifold y is special if it has no fibration of general type fundamental tools for the study of orbifolds are the locally free sheaves p y log of logarithmic forms along classically known when the multiplicities are infinite or said differently when is reduced we shall not give the definition here but simply say that sections of this sheaf can be symbolically written locally in the standard normal crossing coordinates for fixed q as linear combinations of expressions of the form h dyj 1 y 1 1 mj 1 j 1 dyjs y 1 1 mjs js dyjs 1 dyjq with h holomorphic and 1 j 1 js r js 1 jq if y 1 yr is a local equation of the multiplicities being given by the mi s a section of q y log is thus an m th root of a well defined holomorphic tensor when m is an integer divisible by each of the mi s 32 fre de ric campana more precisely a section s of this sheaf is defined as a pair f s where f is a rank one coherent subsheaf of q y log and s is a holomorphic section of f m for some m divisible by all the mi s and such that s qy log m m where is the q divisor on y defined by i i 1 mj j by lifting to a nice covering see section 4 these sections become standard p forms from which one deduces the important property of d closedness of such log forms as we did above one can then also define directly the kodaira dimension of a fibration by introducing the saturation of the differential sheaf defined by g in y log because we may only consider high and divisible multiples to define the kodaira dimensions one does not need to define precisely y log to define this orbifold kodaira dimension and directly look at rank one subsheaves f of y log and define as usual the kodaira dimension of f m m their relevanco to our topic is that special orbifolds y are characterised by the absence of bogomolov sheaves on y defined as in 2 23 above when is empty just replacing there p y by p y log the correspondance between bogomolov sheaves on y and general type fibrations on this orbifold extends to this orbifold context the orbifold additivity theorem then applies in this context the construction of the core for an orbifold can then be made by the second approach we followed as the highest special fibration the geometric approach seems more delicate than for varieties and certainly needs some extra arguments because one needs to take into account the order of contact of the subvarieties with the orbifold divisor 3 the core 3 1 the core functoriality properties we use the notations of section 12 definition 3 1 let x c be normal let a a x c x be the family of special subvarieties of x it is z regular let then t a be the family of its components see proposition 12 22 and let cx x 99 kc x be the t a quotient of x this almost holomorphic fibration will be called the core of x see section 12 in general not much can be said about the fibres of cx except that two of their points are joined by a chain of special subvarieties of x at least if question 12 25 has a positive answer example 3 2 let x be the cone over a variety of general type v then cx is the constant map but x is by no means special since it has a p 1 fibration over v note that this fibration is not almost holomorphic this example shows the role of singularities indeed theorem 3 3 let x c be smooth let cx x c x be the core of x then 1 the general fibre of cx is special 2 if f is a general fibre of cx and if z x is a special subvariety of x meeting f then z is contained in f such a fibre f will be said cx general 3 cx is almost holomorphic special varieties and classification theory 33 remark 3 4 the above result should hold true when x is singular provided it has at most canonical singularities notice that cx is not a bimeromorphic invariant in general as the preceding example shows but it is easily seen from 3 3 to be so if x is smooth then cy cx m if m y x is bimeromorphic when x is smooth we denote by ess x the dimension of c x and call it the essential dimension of x thus ess x 0 iff x is special and ess x d dim x iff x is of general type by theorem 5 5 below in the first case the core is the constant map in the second case it is the identity map theorem 3 5 let x c be normal let cx x 99 kc x be its core and let ax x 99 ka x be its algebraic reduction there exists a factorisation bx a x 99 kc x of cx such that cx bx ax in particular c x is always moishezon proof by theorem 2 3 the fibres of ax which is a bimeromorphic invariant of x are special hence contained in the fibres of cx we shall prove theorem 3 3 below before we start with some easy observations proposition 3 6 let cx x c x be the core of x smooth let h z 99 kx be any mero morphic map assume h z meets some cx general fibre of cx there exists then a natural meromorphic map ch c z 99 kc x such that ch cz cx h proof by the assumption if z z is general its image x h z in x belongs to a cx general fibre fz of cx the fibre of cz through z is special thus so is its image vz by h since vz meets fz it is contained in fz by property 2 in theorem 3 3 hence the existence of ch corollary 3 7 let h z 99 kx be as in proposition 3 6 above then ch as above exists in the following cases 1 cx h z c x is surjective in particular if h itself is surjective 2 z x is the general member of a family zt t t of subvarieties of x such that the varieties cx zt cover c x 3 z xy is a general fibre of cx where c x y is any fibration in this case cz is simply the restriction of cx to z let us give some easy examples in which cx can be described proposition 3 8 let x c be a manifold and assume that f x 99 ky is a special fibration of general type then f cx in particular there is at most one fibration both special and of general type on x proof because f is special there is a factorisation g y 99 kc x such that g f cx indeed the general fibre f of f is special and meets the general fibre c of cx thus f c but f is of general type and so by theorem 2 11 there exists a factorisation h c x 99 ky such that f h cx thus f cx as claimed remark 3 9 we shall later conjecture and prove in some cases see section 5 8 that cx is a fibration of general type so that cx should always be characterised as the unique fibration of domain x both special and of general type 34 fre de ric campana corollary 3 10 let x be a manifold of general type then cx idx the identity map of x and so ess x dim x proof indeed idx is then special and of general type apply then 3 8 remark 3 11 we shall see later in theorem 5 5 that the converse also holds true if ess x dim x 0 then x is of general type corollary 3 12 let x c be a manifold with n dim x then ess x n 1 in the following two cases a x n 1 and jx is a fibration of general type then cx jx b r x the rational quotient of x is of dimension n 1 and of general type proof indeed in case a resp b the generic fibre of jx resp rx is an elliptic resp rational curve the fibration jx resp rx is thus special the other conditions imply that it is also of general type it is thus the core of x in particular ess x n 1 remark 3 13 we shall see later in theorem 5 7 as a consequence of orbifold additivity theo rems that the converse also holds true if ess x dim x 1 0 then x is of the type a or b for the case ess x n 2 see below 3 35 finally in the same section we shall also give a conjectural description of the core as a canonical and functorial composition of orbifold rational quotients and iitaka fibrations corollary 3 14 let f x 99 kc be a special fibration with x c and c a curve then either f is of general type and f cx or f is not of general type and x is special proof in the first case the claim follows from proposition 3 8 in the second from the fact that if g x 99 kz is a fibration of general type there exists by 2 11 a factorisation h c 99 kz such that g h f but c is curve and f is not of general type thus z is a point and g is not of general type contradiction the core can be constructed in a relative setting as well by a simple application of theorem 12 27 theorem 3 15 let f x y with x c there exists a unique factorisation f gf cf by two fibrations cf x c f and gf c f y such that for y y general the restriction cf xy c f y is the core of xy we call the factorisation f gf cf the core of f we now prove theorem 3 3 3 2 construction of the core as the lowest special fibration proof of theorem 3 3 for this we shall simply apply theorem 12 31 to the family a x of special subvarieties of x supposed to be smooth an to be in c we know that a x is z regular see section 12 4 for this notion it is thus sufficient to show that a x is also stable see 12 5 for this notion the property stab 2 is obtained by applying corollary 2 5 the property stab 1 is the content of the next theorem which thus establishes at the same time theorem 3 3 special varieties and classification theory 35 theorem 3 16 let t t a x c x be a special family as above with x smooth in c assume each irreducible component of t is x covering then 1 x is special if x is t connected ie qt is the constant map 2 the general fibre of qt is special proof the second assertion is a consequence of the first because the if xy is a general fibre of qt then xy is smooth since qt is almost holomorphic and the family ty consisting of t t such that vt xy is a finite union of covering families of xy with general member special and such that xy is ty connected we thus only need to show the first statement assume there existed a meromorphic fibration f x y of general type by 2 21 f is almost holomorphic since x is supposed to be smooth by theorem 2 11 applied to each irreducible component vi of v we have a meromorphic factori sation t y such that g f v y assume first that f is holomorphic thus f is constant on every vt and so on every t chain because x is t connected f takes the same value on two arbitrary points of x thus f is constant and y is a single point in contradiction with the fact that it is of general type thus x is special as claimed if f is only almost holomorphic the same argument applies provided we choose an f regular point y y for every t t if vt meets xy then vt is contained in xy because of the factorisation property g f and the usual rigidity lemma more precisely approximate vt in c x by a sequence vtn such that vtn xyn f 1 u for some stein or affine in the algebraic category neighborhood u of y in y and n large this is possible because the generic vt is contained in a fibre of f then vt xy by an easy argument based on the fact that f is holomorphic on f 1 u so we get that the generic member hence every member of the family t is contained in some fibre of f here the notion of fibre of f is the usual chow scheme theoretic one defined in section 1 1 2 thus every t chain meeting xy is contained in xy because x is t connected x is contained in xy and f is constant and so not of general type as assumed contradiction we can now establish the following often useful characterisations of the core theorem 3 17 let f x 99 ky be a special fibration with x c such that for any special fibration g x 99 kz there exists a factorisation z 99 ky of f g then f cx is the core of x in particular if f x 99 ky is a special fibration of general type it is the core of x the relevant diagram is x f g y z ff proof first because cx is special there exists a factorisation c x 99 ky let f be a cx general fibre of cx by the existence of it is contained in some fibre g of f but g is special because f is by the defining property of cx we have the reverse inclusion g f 36 fre de ric campana the last assertion follows now from theorem 2 11 because f being of general type for any special fibration g theorem 2 11 shows that the factorisation exists 3 3 rationally connected manifolds we now come to our first basic example of special manifolds the rationally connected ones we recall first their definition and some properties recall c 3 ko mi mo that an irreducible compact complex space x is said to be rationally connected if any two generic points of x are contained in a rational chain of x ie a connected projective curve ofx all irreducible components of which are rational possibly singular curves examples of rationally connected manifolds include unirational and fano manifolds twistor spaces this property is bimeromorphically stable among manifolds but not among varieties the cone over a projective manifold which is not rationally connected will again provide such an example of course the above definition can be given for algebraic varieties defined over arbitrary fields we refer to ko mi mo for some of the fundamental properties of this class of manifolds rational connectedness has a slightly different characterisation by the following fundamental result g h s theorem 3 18 g h s any fibration f x c over a projective curve c with x smooth projective and generic fibre rationally connected has a holomorphic section definition 3 19 c 95 let x c be irreducible we say that x is rationally generated if for any surjective meromorphic map f x 99 ky y is uniruled any rationally connected x c is thus rationally generated but conversely theorem 3 20 let x c be rationally generated then x is rationally connected proof by induction on the dimension x is uniruled take f idx let rx x r x be the rational quotient of x then r x is also rationally generated obvious by induction it is rationally connected so it is in particular moishezon by c 81 which says in particular that if any two points of x c can be joined by a chain of curves then x is moishezon thus x too is moishezon by c 85 which says among others that x c is moishezon if there is a fibration u x 99 ky with y and the generic fibre f of u moishezon if f has q f 0 because the fibres of rx are moishezon with vanishing irregularity we can assume x to be projective by the bimeromorphic invariance of the rational generatedness but then the conclusion follows easily from g h s which allows to lift rational curves from r x to x theorem 3 21 let x c be a rationally connected manifold then x is special notice that the smoothness ofx is essential as shown again by the cone over a projective manifold of general type proof let cx x 99 kc x be the core assume it is not the constant map let f be a cx general fibre of cx because x is rationally connected some rational curve in x meets f but is not contained in f contradiction we now extend these results to the relative case special varieties and classification theory 37 3 4 the rational quotient and the core we now turn to the study of the rational quotient of x from the point of view of special varieties the rational quotient of x c was introduced in c 3 as an application of t quotients it was also independently constructed in ko mi mo under the name of maximal rationally connected fibration m r c for short by a different method based on their glueing lemma for rational curves in the algebraic context theorem 3 22 let x c be normal there exists a unique meromorphic fibration rx x 99 kr x called the rational quotient of x such that 1 the general fibre of rx is rationally connected 2 the general fibre of rx contains any rational curve of x that it meets as usual rx is almost holomorphic the proof is given in section 12 see theorem 12 26 notice that by theorem 12 28 the rational quotient also exists in relative version corollary 3 23 let x c be smooth the rational quotient rx of x is then a special fibration there exists a factorisation cr x r x 99 kc x of cx cr x rx proof this is simply because x and so the generic fibre of rx is special by theorem 3 21 this shows the first assertion notice the second is obvious and does not require x to be smooth we have the following easy property already shown for cx the proof for rx is similar proposition 3 24 let f x y be a surjective meromorphic map with x c then f induces fonctorial maps always denoted f f r x r y and f c x c y in the above proposition taking f rx we get in particular a natural map rx c x 99 kc r x for the rational quotient we have a particular property not valid for arbitrary special fibrations theorem 3 25 let x be smooth and moishezon let rx x r x be the rational quotient of x let cr x r x c r x be the core of r x then rx c x 99 kc r x is bimeromorphic equivalently cr x rx x c r x is the core of x in other words c r x c x remark 3 26 the hypothesis that x is moishezon can certainly be weakened to x c for this it is sufficient to make the same weakening in the hypothesis for g in 3 28 below proof we have natural fibrations r x 99 kc x and rx c x 99 kc r x defined above we thus only need to show that is isomorphic or that the general fibre f of cr x rx x 99 kc r x is special observe that we have by restricting rx to f a map rx f 99 kg where g rx f is the corresponding fibre of cr x thus f is fibered over g which is special with fibres which are generically rationally connected the claim thus follows from the next proposition 3 27 let r f g be a fibration with f c such that g is moishezon and special and the generic fibre of f is rationally connected then f is special 38 fre de ric campana proof let if any g f h be an admissible holomorphic fibration of general type since f has special fibres there exists by theorem 2 11 a factorisation g h of g f but now by lemmas 3 28 and 3 29 below we see that g thus is of general type too but this contradicts g being special such a g thus does not exist and x is special lemma 3 28 let f f g be a fibration with generic fibres rationally connected and g moishe zon then f is multiplicity free ie f is empty proof we may assume that g is projective the claim then follows immediately from g h s and is actually the most difficult part of the proof by considering the restriction of f over a very ample curve of g meeting transversally any irreducible component of f the proof of the following is immediate from the definition of multiplicities and the computation of the base orbifold divisor of a composed fibration as in section 1 6 lemma 3 29 let f f g and g h be fibrations assume that f is multiplicity free then f 3 5 surfaces we can describe the core of a surface as follows in terms of its rational quotient or iitaka moishezon fibration this will be extended to threefolds in the next section a conjectural description in arbitrary dimension will be given in section 6 4 recall that for any compact connected complex manifold x with x 0 we denote by jx x 99 kj x its iitaka moshezon fibration let also x j x jx obviously x x theorem 3 30 let x be a compact ka hler smooth surface then its core cx is described as follows 1 x 2 then cx idx and ess x 2 2 x x 1 then cx jx and ess x 1 3 x 1 x x is special 4 x 0 x is special 5 x and q x 2 then cx rx ess x 1 6 x and q x 1 x is special proof if x 2 the claim is given by 3 10 if x 1 the fibration jx x 99 kc j x is special and the claim follows from 3 14 if x 0 x is special from the facts just recalled above if x from the classification of surfaces x is bimeromorphic to p 1 c c a curve with g c q x and rx is the projection to c if q 0 and the constant map if q 0 the claims are then obvious corollary 3 31 let x be a ka hler surface either x is special and cx is the constant map or x 1 and cx jx the iitaka fibration or x and cx rx the rational quotient of x one can compute ess x as follows 1 ess x 2 iff x 2 2 ess x 1 iff x 1 and 1 x is not virtually abelian special varieties and classification theory 39 3 ess x 0 iff x 1 and 1 x is virtually abelian recall that a group g is said to be almost or virtually abelian if it has a finite index sugroup which is abelian proof all claims are deduced immediately from 3 30 except for the ones concerning the funda mental group when x 1 if x then 1 x 1 c with the notations of the proof of 3 30 the assertion is obvious if x 0 we know that 1 x is almost abelian from classification theory if x 1 the assertion follows from lemma 3 33 applied to jx corollary 3 32 a compact ka hler surface x is special if and only if it has a finite e tale cover which is bimeromorphic to one of the following surfaces 1 p 2 c 2 p 1 c e with e elliptic 3 k 3 or abelian 4 elliptic over a curve c with m multiple fibres c either rational then m 2 or elliptic then m 0 proof the surfaces listed above are special by 3 30 above thus so are their undercovers conversely if x is special it has a finite e tale cover in the preceding list this is clear if x 0 by classification and from the next lemma 3 33 if x 1 lemma 3 33 let f x c be a relatively minimal elliptic fibration on the compact ka hler surface x 1 let f c j j mj dj be any scheme theoretic fibre xc of f then its multiplicity m c f inf mj is also equal to m c f gcd mj 2 there exists a finite e tale cover u x x such that if v f f u is the stein factorisation of f u with f x c connected and v c c finite then f has no multiple fibre if g c 1 and at most 2 multiple fibres of coprime multiplicities if c is rational 3 moreover g c c f c f in the preceding situation 4 x is special if and only if 1 x is almost abelian proof 1 follows from kodaira s classification of singular fibres of elliptic fibrations b p v chap v 7 this equality actually also follows from an elementary argument in the more general case of fibrations with generic fibre a complex torus assertion 2 follows from c 98 and n n shows that if a curve c with points a 1 am affected with multiplicities n 1 nm is given there exists a cover c of c ramified above the ai s only each point above any ai having ramification exactly ni the only exception is when c p 1 m 1 2 and when n 1 6 n 2 if m 2 in c 98 it is shown it is a simple computation that the base change over c leads to the sought after e tale cover u x x then property 3 follows from theorem 1 7 for the second equality and from the fact that m 0 if g c 1 we show 4 if x is special then c f 0 so that c is rational or elliptic we apply c 98 which shows that the natural sequence of maps 40 fre de ric campana 1 f 1 x 1 c 1 is exact with f a generic fibre of f so that f is an elliptic curve and 1 f z 2 thus 1 x is almost abelian if x is special which is true if so is x because f is special and c f c f conversely assume that 1 x is almost abelian then so is 1 c and c is either rational or elliptic thus c f 0 and x is special by 3 30 3 6 higher kodaira dimensions we shall define higher kodaira dimensions of any con nected manifold x c as follows this works for compact connected manifolds as well actually the first kodaira dimension of x is the usual one x if x the second kodaira dimension of x is not defined otherwise x 0 and jx x j x the iitaka moishezon fibration of x is defined let then x j x jx we of course have x dim j x x j x if x the next kodaira dimension x is not derfined otherwise x 0 let then j 0 1 x j x j x be the iitaka fibration defined on j x by the q divisor kj x jx for any admissible model of the fibration jx define j x j 0 1 x jx x j x define next x j x j x j x of course we have x x x for the invariants so defined continuing inductively we can define a decreasing sequence of invariants x x r x and iterated orbifold iitaka fibrations j r x x 99 kj r x if the sequence is defined til j r x define r 1 x j r x j r x and if this is nonnegative define j r r 1 x as being the iitaka fibration defined by the q divisor kj r x j r x for any admissible model of the fibration j r x we thus have fibrations j r 1 r x j r 1 x 99 kj r x such that j r x j r 1 r x j r 1 x observe also that fr j r x 0 if fr is a general fibre of j r 1 r x by the standard property of iitaka fibrations this sequence stops at the first term if any equal to and is stationary if any two terms r x r 1 x are equal and nonnegative necessarily this happens clearly if and only if the corresponding map j r x is of general type the following is easily shown by induction on r proposition 3 34 the sequence of higher kodaira dimensions is invariant under bimeromorphic maps and finite e tale covers we shall later extend these notions and even conjecture that these higher kodaira dimensions are invariant under deformation for x ka hler as an illustration for the introduction of these invariants we show the proposition 3 35 let x c be smooth of dimension n 2 then ess x n 2 in each of the following cases a e moreover the core cx and its generic fibre f a special surface are described as follows special varieties and classification theory 41 a x n 1 x x n 2 then cx j x and f 1 f 0 b x n 1 x there exists r j x 99 kz with dim z n 1 such that f jx is of general type then f 1 and f c x x n 2 then cx jx and f 0 d r x the rational quotient of x is of general type of dimension n 2 then f is a rational surface e r x has dimension n 1 and r x r x n 2 then f is birationally elliptic ruled proof case a indeed the fibre of j x is special because f has an elliptic fibration j f c with c j 0 so the assertion follows from 3 30 by assumption j x is of general type because x x to show that f 1 use the easy addition theorem applied to x and j x it says that n 1 x f dim j x f n 2 dim f n 2 n 1 we shall skip the proofs of the other cases which are easier or similar remark 3 36 we shall also nearly show the converse as a consequence of additivity theorems in section 6 4 actually the converse holds under the general additivity conjecture the formulation of case b is unnatural a natural formulation would require the conjectural notion of rational quotient for orbifolds see 6 4 3 7 threefolds we shall describe the core of a compact ka hler threefold for this we shall need theorem 5 1 shown later in section 5 which says that x is special if x 0 in all dimensions theorem 3 37 let x c be a nonspecial threefold the core cx of x is a fibration of general type moreover one can describe cx its generic fibre f and ess x as follows 1 ess x 3 iff x 3 then cx idx 2 ess x 2 in the following two cases a x x 2 then cx jx is an elliptic fibration of general type b x r x is a surface of general type and cx rx is a p 1 fibration over r x 3 ess x 1 iff one of the following cases occurs a x 2 x x 1 then cx j x is a fibration of general type onto a curve with f a special surface with f 1 and f 0 b x 2 x x nonspecial then cx is a fibration of general type onto a curve with f 1 and x c x x 1 then cx jx is a fibration of general type onto a curve with f 0 d cx rx is a fibration onto a curve of general type with f a rational surface e cx jr x rx is a fibration of general type over a curve with f a birationally ruled elliptic surface we now give a very rough list of the special threefolds theorem 3 38 any special threefold x c is one of the following 1 x 2 42 fre de ric campana a x 1 x j x is a non general type fibration over a curve with fibre f a special surface with f 1 f 0 b x 0 jx is an elliptic fibration with a klt orbifold base a normal surface with torsion canonical bundle ks the log enriques case c x x has either a non general type fibration over a curve with generic fibre a special surface f with f 1 f or an elliptic fibration with base orbifold a klt normal surface with picard number one and log del pezzo ie ks is ample 2 x 1 then jx is a non general type fibration over a curve with generic fibre f a surface with f 0 3 x 0 4 x x is either rationally connected or a fibration over an elliptic curve with generic fibre a rational surface or a p 1 fibration over a special surface s with s 0 the case where x is simple non kummer conjecturally does not exist but strictly speaking additionally belongs to the last part 4 of the above list because x 0 then proof we shall prove both results 3 37 and 3 38 at the same time the case where x is clear from the section 12 26 above because x is then uniruled if x is projective by miy and by c p otherwise if x is not simple so we proceed case by case assuming x 0 if x 0 we are done by theorem 5 1 if x is non projective we could also have applied c p theorem 8 1 which says that if x has a nonzero holomorphic 2 form it is covered by either a torus or by the product of an elliptic curve and a k 3 surface thus x is special in this case too the existence of a nonzero 2 form when x is non projective is a famous result of k kodaira we now classify the cases occuring according to the pairs x x x 1 when the two terms are equal and positive we conclude from 3 8 that jx is the core and of general type if x 1 and x 0 we conclude from 3 14 that x is special we are thus left with the cases where x 2 x 1 we thus now assume that x 2 assume first that x 1 consider the map j x x j x using the notations of 3 6 it has general special fibres because if f is its general fibre and g jx f then the restriction to f of jx defines j f g which has generic fibres elliptic curves while g is a curve and by the definition of j 0 1 x we have g j 0 we conclude from 3 14 that f is a special surface the easy addition theorem shows that f 1 if x 1 j x is a fibration both special and of general type so we conclude from 3 8 that it is the core of x otherwise if x 0 x is special we are thus done with this case ess x 0 or 1 we are now left with the more difficult case when x 0 assume that x is not special let f x y be a fibration of general type the fibration jx being special we get from 1 12 a factorisation j x y of f jx thus y has to be a curve special varieties and classification theory 43 to conclude the proof we thus just need to show that this does not happen if x 0 because of the minimal model program applied to a klt surface orbifold as described below the assertion we need follows from proposition 3 40 below but we need first some definitions for its statement 3 8 orbifold surfaces a surface orbifold will be a klt pair s with s a normal projective surface together with an orbifold divisor on it if g s c is a holomorphic fibration we define the orbifold base of g s c as the pair c g g where g is the weil q divisor on c defined as follows f c c 1 1 m c g c with m c g infj j mj nj and g c j j mj dj here nj is simply 1 dj 1 if dj 1 1 nj is the multiplicity of dj in remark 3 39 as in 1 6 we see that if h x s is a fibration with h then f g h on a suitable model of h we define then as usual the canonical bundle and kodaira dimension of c f and s by definition ks is supposed to be q cartier we then say that g is of general type if c f 1 and that s is special if s 2 and if there is no holomorphic fibration of general type g s c onto a curve proposition 3 40 let s be a surface orbifold if s 0 then s is special proof assume there exists a general type fibration g on s we shall show that s 6 0 we thus apply the mmp to our initial pair s this produces a sequence of elementary contractions of the form k s s with s still a klt pair such that after at most s 1 steps one gets for the final pair denoted also s one of the three basic cases 1 k s is nef 2 there is a fibration g s c onto a curve such that k s is g ample and s 2 3 k s is ample and s 1 log del pezzo case notice that at each step the kodaira dimension of the pair s is preserved and that the curve being contracted is rational smooth because s itself is klt we refer to k m and f m for the existence and usual properties of these reduction steps in cases 2 3 we have x x so these cases do not occur because we assumed that x 0 thus k s is nef claim d ks 0 indeed we have d 2 0 otherwise we had x 2 from f mk 11 3 we get the claim their theorem asserts that x is equal to the numerical kodaira dimension of x the rest of the proof rests on the following two lemmas 3 41 and 3 42 the first one will be proved at the end of this section lemma 3 41 let g s c be a fibration of general type with s klt let e be a rational curve mapped surjectively onto c by g then e 2 corollary 3 42 let k s s is the contraction of an irreducible smooth rational curve e with s s klt surfaces ks e 0 and k 44 fre de ric campana if g s c is a fibration of general type then there exists g s c such that g g k moreover g is still of general type and ks k ks if ks e 0 proof of 3 42 the second assertion is clear if the first one is this is because m c g m c g since in the definition of the left hand side of the inequality the infimum is taken over a smaller subset the first assertion is clear also if g c 1 because the rational curve e contracted by k cannot be mapped surjectively to c by g we shall show that this also cannot happen when c is rational because g is of general type actually as the proof shows the condition c g 0 is sufficient even we use the following numerical conditions a e 2 0 e exceptional b k e e 2 e rational smooth c k e 0 so we assume by contradiction that e is mapped onto c by g we then get e k e 2 e 2 2 which contradicts 3 41 we now complete the proof of 3 40 we then apply the minimal odel program to s but relative to ks at each step again only smooth rational k negative curves are contracted let s be the resulting pair it has by 3 42 all properties of s in particular d ks 0 and g x c is of general type put k ks assume first that x 0 in addition to the above properties ks is nef by our assumptions the generic fibre of g is elliptic and is vertical ie contained in fibres of g thus k 2 0 d 0 d 2 thus d 2 0 and so d is a union of complete fibres of g by zariski s lemma there exists thus an orbifold divisor on c such that g because x 0 and c 1 we easily get that x 1 see lemma 4 10 below for example a contradiction we now treat the remaining case in which x now d is g ample and every fibre of g has an irreducible reduction as above g for an orbifold structure of general type on c we thus have s 2 and the arguments of f mk theorem 11 2 3 show that ks hor f hor is the horizontal part of defined as usual and f is any fibre of g here q is such that 2 q 2 with q the genus of c thus d deg f has kodaira dimension at least 1 because deg 2 2 q contradiction we still have to show lemma 3 41 proof of 3 41 from hurwitz s formula we get 2 2 d e e re 1 where d is the degree of the restriction h e c of g to e and for each e e re is the ramification order of h at e fix c c write g c j j mj dj special varieties and classification theory 45 m inf mj nj j j nj 1 dj 1 dj multiplicity of dj in let ec e sc where sc g 1 c is the fibre of g over c claim e ec re 1 1 1 m d c e where c is the union of components of contained in sc with their corresponding multiplicities then lemma 3 41 is an easy consequence of the claim indeed 2 2 d e e re 1 2 d c c e ec re 1 2 d g e e if g deg 2 d e but deg 2 0 because g is of general type hence the conclusion of 3 41 to complete the proof we establish the preceding claim proof of the claim 1 1 m g c e 1 1 m j j mj dj e j j mj mj m dj e j j mj 1 1 1 nj dj e because mj nj m j j j j mj 1 dj e e we are thus reduced to show that j j mj 1 dj e e ec re 1 because j j mj dj e e ec re d we just need to establish that j jdj e e ec 1 which itself follows from the inequality j j dj e e 1 e ec where the intersection number dj e e is the local intersection number near e recall that s is only assumed to be normal we now show this last inequality indeed we have j j mj dj e re and the conclusion follows from the inequality mj re j j to show this inequality we make a base change over h e c let x be the normalisation of the fibre product x c e and let k x x g x e such that k g h g be the natural maps induced from this base change let e x be the lift of e to x it is a section of g let e be the point of e lying above e the components of g c which contain e are thus reduced this easily implies the conclusion by looking at a generic point of dj near which the projection g is locally given by the equation g t z zmj the fibre product is thus locally given by an equation of the form re zmj dividing by d gcd re mj we can assume that d 1 since we normalised the fibre product thus we have on x local coordinates t s with smj and z sre locally the projection g is given in these coordinates by g t s from which we deduce that mj 1 thus mj divides re this in particular proves the claimed inequality remark 3 43 what we actually proved in this section is the orbifold additivity for kodaira dimensions in dimension 2 the general case is stated in the next section at 4 4 4 orbifold additivity 4 1 orbifold conjecture cn m we use the notations and notions introduced in section 1 6 46 fre de ric campana so if g y h z is a holomorphic fibration from the manifold y equipped with the orbifold divisor h we defined the base orbifold g h on z the fundamental property of this definition is that whenh f for some fibration f x y then g f for suitable models of f g which can be choosen so that f g g f are admissible definition 4 1 we shall say that g y h z is high resp very high if there exists a modification u 0 y y 0 with y 0 smooth such that a and b resp a and b below are satisfied a every g exceptional divisor of y is u 0 exceptional b y h y 0 h 0 with h 0 u 0 h b ky h u 0 ky 0 h 0 the following properties are immediate using the arguments of 1 11 and 1 28 for 3 proposition 4 2 1 if g is very high it is high 2 if g is high then y ky h b y ky h for any effective g exceptional q divisor b on y 3 if h f then one can choose models of f g in such a way that g is high prepared that g f g h and f g g f are admissible now we can state the orbifold additivity conjecture corbn m conjecture 4 3 corbn m let g y h z be a holomorphic fibration between manifolds as above with y c assume g is prepared and high then y h y h z z g h where z z is general and y h z yz hz of fundamental importance for the considerations of the present paper is the following special case shown by suitably adapting the classical methods of proof t fujita y kawamata e viehweg theorem 4 4 corbgt let g y h z be a holomorphic fibration between manifolds as above with y c and z projective assume g is prepared high and of general type ie z g h dim z then y h y h z dim z where z z is general and y h z yz hz of course the above corbn m is a simple generalisation and refinement of the classical conjecture of s iitaka dictated by the constructions made in the previous chapters let us list some of its corollaries or special cases of the above conjecture proposition 4 5 assume corbn m holds let f x y and g y z be fibrations with x c then y f yz fz z g f where z z is general and fz xz yz is the restriction of f proof by 1 6 and 1 25 we can choose models of g and f in such a way that f g g f are admissible prepared with g high g f g f and such moreover that fz is admissible we conclude then from corbn m and the following equalities y f y f yz f z yz fz and special varieties and classification theory 47 z g f z g f z g f in the special case where x y we get proposition 4 6 assume corbn m holds let g y z be a fibration with y c then y yz z g yz z the extreme inequality is of course the classical iitaka conjecture let us first list some immediate consequences of theorem 4 4 corollary 4 7 let f x y and g y z be fibrations with x c assume g f is of general type then y f yz fz dim z corollary 4 8 let g y z be a fibration with y c assume g is of general type then y yz dim z we shall now give the proof of theorem 4 4 it is classically done in two steps first an easy reduction to weak positivity statements for direct images by g of twisted pluricanonical forms second the proof of semipositivity the first step is entirely similar to the known cases so we shall be brief on it the second step is simply obtained by introducing the orbifold divisors at appropriate places in the classical proofs of y kawamata and e viehweg see also the initial work fuj 78 4 2 reduction to weak positivity we start by briefly recalling the notion of weak positivity introduced in vi 83 see also the survey e a torsionfree coherent sheaf f on z projective is said to be weakly positive written w p for short if for any ample line bundle a on z and every a 0 integer there exists an integer b 0 such that sab f ab is generated over some nonempty open subset u of z by its global sections defined over z here sab f denotes the extension to z of the sheaf denoted by the same symbol naturally defined over the open subset where f is locally free remark 4 9 the following properties are shown in vi 82 1 if f is locally free and nef it is w p 2 let v z z be bimeromorphic and f g a inclusion of torsionfree coherent sheaves of the same rank on z if f is w p then so is v g 3 if v z z is a ramified flat covering with z z smooth and if f is torsionfree coherent on z then f is w p if so is v f we now state without proofs two lemmas shown but not separately stated in e and in various more or less implicit forms in vi 82 and kw 81 together with the weak positivity result shown in the next section they imply immediately theorem 4 4 lemma 4 10 let g y z be a fibration with z projective let e and l be q divisors on y and z respectively such that l is big and y e 0 then y e g l dim z yz e yz for z general in z the crucial place where weak positivity enters is to check that y e 0 48 fre de ric campana lemma 4 11 let g y z be a fibration e a line bundle on y and l a q divisor on z assume l is big and g e is weakly positive and nonzero then y e g l 0 in the next section we shall show theorem 4 12 in the situation and hypothesis of theorem 4 4 for any sufficiently divisible integer m 0 there exists an effective g exceptional divisor b on y such that the sheaf g m k y z g h h b is weakly positive on z if g is very high we can choose b 0 let us now explain how to deduce theorem 4 4 from the preceding lemmas and theorem 4 12 apply first 4 11 to e m k y z g h h b with m 0 an integer sufficiently divisible so chosen that g e is nonzero and w p and l m 2 k z g h which is big by hypothesis we conclude that y e g l 0 thus e e g l h is such that y e 0 next apply 4 10 to e and l to conclude that y ky h b m satisfies the inequality stated in 4 4 use finally the fact that g is high to conclude the proof of 4 4 because y ky h b m y ky h 4 3 orbifold weak positivity our objective in the next two sections is to establish theorem 4 12 stated and used above notation 4 13 we consider thus a prepared holomorphic fibration g y z with y and z smooth and z projective that g is prepared means that its non smooth locus is contained in a simple normal crossing divisor of z and that the inverse image by g of this non smooth locus is also a divisor of simple normal crossings on y we let g and g h be the orbifold divisors for g and g h respectively the second one is defined in 1 6 to which we refer for details thus g i i 1 1 mi i also is of simple normal crossings we define also kz kz and ky z ky g kz 1 we apply similar notations for notice that remark 4 14 notice that g h g hvert where hvert is the g vertical part of h equal to k k 1 1 nk hk where k k consists of the components of h which are not mapped onto z by g we shall also denote by hhor the g horizontal part of h defined such that h hvert hhor our objective in this section is to establish the following orbifold generalisation of famous results of y kawamata anf e viehweg initiated by t fujita in the case where z is a curve we shall actually essentially just reduce our case to the cases they treated theorem 4 15 let g y z be as above prepared let h be an orbifold structure on y and g h as above assume z is projective and y is ka hler compact let m 0 be an integer such that all q divisors involved are integral special varieties and classification theory 49 then g m k y z h b is weakly positive for b a suitable effective g exceptional divisor on y we shall obtain this result as the consequence of three intermediate steps the first step is a generalisation of the standard weak positivity results for direct image sheaves of pluricanonical forms in ka hler geometry theorem 4 16 let g y z be a fibration as in 4 15 above with the same assumptions let d j j dj dj be a divisor with integer positive coefficients on y the dj being as always pairwise distinct assume also that the support of d is a divisor of simple normal crossings and that d is horizontal which means that each dj is mapped surjectively onto z by g let m be a positive integer such that m dj j j then g mky z d is weakly positive this result will be proved in the next section observe that the restriction that d is horizontal is obviously unnecessary because in general one can remove the vertical part of d if any and then get an injection from the direct image sheaf relative to the horizontal part of d into the same sheaf relative to all of d notice that there is then no restriction needed on the multiplicities of the vertical components of d besides nonnegativity the second and third steps are given by the following lemma 4 17 and proposition 4 18 lemma 4 17 let g y z d and m satify the same assumptions as the preceding 4 16 if v z z is a flat finite map with z smooth and if g y z is deduced from g by smoothing the base change y y z z of y by v there is a natural injection of sheaves g mky z d v g mky z d where d u d if u y y is the natural map obtained by composing the desingularisation d y y with the base change map u y y proposition 4 18 let g d m be as in 4 17 above let in addition h hvert be an orbifold vertical divisor on y which means that no component of h is mapped onto z by g there exists a finite flat map v z z with z smooth such that if g y z is constructed as in 4 17 above from v the above injection of sheaves extends to an injection g mky z d v g mky z g h h d b for some effective g exceptional divisor b on y we shall give below the proofs of the preceding lemma and proposition let us first show that they imply together with 4 16 the theorem 4 15 write mh d mhvert with d mhhor this is an integral divisor if m is sufficiently divisible moreover 0 dj 1 1 mj m m for each j so that 4 16 applies to g and d if g is deduced from g by any base change v z z as in lemma 4 17 above and if d is the strict transform by u y y of d so that it is the horizontal part for g of d u d actually by the obvious injection of sheaves the same result applies also if d u d because then only effective vertical divsors are added if we now apply the proposition 4 18 we see that the conclusion of 4 15 holds we shall now prove 4 17 and 4 18 proof of 4 17 we use the notations of 4 17 it is proved in vi 83 lemma 3 3 pp 335 336 to which we refer that in our situation we have d mky z naturally injects into u mky z this statement implies that d mky z d injects into u mky z d since d u d we then just need to apply g to both sides noticing that g u v g by flatness of v 50 fre de ric campana here g y z is of course deduced from g by the base change v proof of 4 18 we start with the construction of v definition 4 19 let g as above a finite covering v z z is said to be nice in similarity to kw if 1 it is flat and z is smooth 2 v i m i i for some reduced divisor i z this for any i i here m i is any integer divisible by lcm mij s these being the same as above used to define the multiplicity of g along i observe in particular that v is cartier on z 3 v 1 is a divisor of normal crossings on z by kw and vi 82 such coverings exist construction let v z z be a nice covering let u y y be the composition u u n d in which u u y y y z z y is the base change by v n y n y is the normalisation and d y y n is a desingularisation isomorphic above the smooth locus of y n one thus also has with the previous notations of 4 17 d n d we also denote by g g y z and g g d y z the maps deduced from g then 4 18 is an immediate consequence of 4 9 and the following proposition 4 20 in the preceding situation there exists on z a natural injection of sheaves u g m ky z d g v m v g m ky z hvert d b this for any integer m 0 sufficiently divisible and some effective g exceptional divisor b on y proof the main point is that we just need to check this injection on the complement of a codimension two subvariety a of z since by 4 17 the result holds with g v m deleted from the left hand side and hvert deleted from the right hand side on all of z this provided oy b is defined by the poles of maximal order acquired by an arbitrary extension across a of a section of g m ky z g v m defined outside of a observe that we are working here on the fibre product y z z which is cohen mac caulay by the normal crossing hypothesis on so that the poles of the sections considered actually occur in codimension one this observation is due to s druel we shall thus check the above injection only above the generic point z of some i let u be a sufficiently small analytic open neighborhood of z in z let yu g 1 u and let w y be a small analytic neighborhood of y a generic point of dij notations being as in 1 1 2 thus mij divides m ij mij q for some integer q qi j by the definition of a nice covering factorise v v v over u with v z z and v z z in such a way that v resp v ramifies at order exactly mij resp q above i resp i v 1 i construct y from y over z by taking base change by v followed by normalisation and then smoothing we have also a natural fibration g y z possibly modifying y we thus get a factorisation u u u moreover from the usual commu tation properties we have v g g u and v g g u special varieties and classification theory 51 the crucial property in this construction is that u is e tale over w if sufficiently small this is an easy standard local computation which we already used several times before see c 2 for example thus u is e tale over the generic point of dij from the following lemma 4 21 below we deduce that over the generic point of dij we have a natural injection of sheaves m k y z u m ky z hvert for any integer m 0 sufficiently divisible from this injection we can deduce the following by tensorising with oy d and its lift oy d to y by u m k y z d u m ky z hvert d the very same argument as in the proof of 4 17 above shows the existence for any j on which the preceding factorisations depend of a natural injection of sheaves g m ky z d v g m ky z d by composing the above injections and restricting over w we see that the sections of g m ky z d actually belong to v g m ky z h vert d we identify local sections of g m ky z d over z and sections of m ky z d over corresponding open subsets of y the conclusion now follows from hartog s extension theorem applied over yu to extend the sections thus obtained across the intersection of two or more such di j s we used the following lemma 4 21 with the above notations over the generic point of dij we have a natural injection of sheaves m k y z u m ky z hvert for any integer m 0 sufficiently divisible proof we shall argue using instead of sheaf injections rather inequalities between q divisors the inequality a b meaning as usual that a b is effective from the equalities ky u ky because u is e tale and kz v kz 1 1 mi j i ramification formula we deduce that ky z u ky z mi j 1 di j because g i mi j di j and g u v g on the other hand ky z h vert ky z g 1 1 m i i 1 1 ni j di j ky z mi j 1 1 m i 1 1 ni j di j ky z mi j 1 mi j m i 1 ni j di j ky z mi j 1 di j since mi j ni j m i by the very definition of m i this concludes the proof by applying u 4 4 twisted weak positivity the aim of this section is to prove theorem 4 16 for this we shall refer to the proof given in vi 83 of the classical case where d is empty and simply indicate the changes needed i would like to heartily thank e viehweg who gave me a decisive hint for the proof of the following lemma the single change needed lies in the corollary 5 2 of vi 83 we restate this corollary in the form we need lemma 4 22 let g y z be as above let a be ample on z let a g a 52 fre de ric campana assume that sn g mky z d ma is generated by its global sections on some nonempty open subset of z then g mky z d m 1 a is weakly positive on z one can thus withdraw one a in the above situation this is sufficient to conclude to the desired weak positivity see vi 83 for the ingenious details proof we shall closely follow the proof of the same corollary 5 2 where d is empty in vi 83 the proof in fact reduces to add d everywhere in an appropriate way observe also that the proof given there uses only the fact that g ky z is weakly positive when y is projective the case when y is ka hler can be obtained from the different proof of this fact sketched in vi 86 based on ko 86 see the references in vi 86 for more details because it uses only the hodge theoretic result due to p deligne that holomorphic forms with logarithmic poles on a compact ka hler manifold are d closed take now l k d a with k ky z define next m image g g mk d ma m k d a assume that the base locus of nml m 1 nd does not contain any component of d we can of course always easily reduce to this case by diminishing the relevant dj s without modifying the conclusion we now reproduce the proof of vi 83 5 2 blowing up y if needed we can assume thatm is a line bundle and that nml nmm e m 1 nd for e an effective divisor on y not containing any component of d such that e d has a support of normal crossings by hypothesis nm m is generated by global sections over a nonempty zariski open subset of z we first treat the case in which m dj j j the corollary 5 1 of vi 83 then applies without any change and shows that the subsheaf g k l m 1 g k m 1 l is weakly positive in the notations l m 1 of vi 82 2 2 here l m 1 m 1 l m 1 mn e m 1 nd the integral part of a q divisor being computed just by taking the integral part of the coefficients componentwise from the constructions made we see that g k l m 1 g k m 1 l m 1 2 mn d and that they coincide over the generic point of z the sheaf on the right is thus weakly positive too computing we get k m 1 l m 1 2 mn d k m 1 l j j m 1 2 mj m dj mk j j m 1 mj m 2 mj mj m dj mk d as desired this ends the proof of the special case all dj m considered when dj m for certain components j of d so that d d m each component dj of d having dj m one just needs to replace k by k in the above proof using the fact that g k is weakly positive on z by kw thm 32 which can be proved also using the above result of deligne in the ka hler case once this lemma 4 22 is obtained the rest of the proof of the weak positivity of g mk d is the same as the one given in vi 83 when d is empty 5 geometric consequences of additivity 5 1 varieties with 0 the second fundamental example of special manifold is given by the special varieties and classification theory 53 theorem 5 1 assume x c has x 0 then x is special proof this is an immediate application of theorem 4 4 let indeed f x y be a fibration of general type then the results apply and give x xy dim z but dim z 0 by hypothesis and xy 0 contradiction remark 5 2 this theorem together with theorem 2 26 shows that x has no bogomolov sheaf if x 0 actually more is expected x 0 if x 0 see c 95 for details and definitions this equality is shown for x projective or ka hler using yau s results if c 1 x 0 5 2 the albanese map the following result uses indirectly only the easiest part of the ad ditivity theorem 4 4 it nevertheless seems to belong to this section proposition 5 3 let x c be special let x x alb x be the albanese map of x then is surjective connected and has no multiple fibres in codimension one ie is empty if x is only w special see section 6 6 below for this notion then is surjective and connected proof assume x is not onto let z alb x be its image after u 10 9 there exists a fibration g z w with w of general type thus dim y 0 let x w and w w be the stein factorisation of then w is of general type too since is finite this contradicts the fact that x is special thus is onto and z alb x let now be the stein factorisation of with x a connected and a alb x finite a slight variation of the arguments of k v shows that if is ramified there exists a fibration a w with w of general type considering we get as above a contradiction to the fact that x is special thus is unramified hence isomorphic by the universal property of which is thus connected and onto assume now that the fibration x alb x has nonempty let be any compo nent of there exists a connected submersive quotient map q alb x a alb x b for some subtorus b of alb x such that q 1 d for some big q divisor d a consider the fibration f q x a the support of f a obviously contains d we conclude from 1 12 that f is of general type since ka is trivial and d is big on a again this contradicts the assumption of x being special and concludes the proof if x is special if x is only w special the first two steps of the proof apply without any change to give the last assertion question 5 4 let x c be a special manifold are then the generic fibres of x special one can easily show that this question has a positive answer if so does the conjecture corbn m 5 3 varieties of general type although the results of this section are easy consequences of the main result 5 8 below we give a direct proof theorem 5 5 for any manifold x c we have ess x dim x if and only if x is of general type 54 fre de ric campana in particular x is generically covered by a nontrivial family of special submanifolds the fibres of cx if x is not of general type the case when x 0 is clear by theorem 5 1 applied to the fibres of the iitaka moishezon fibration of x so the result applies nontrivially only when x and its proof gives the following theorem 5 6 let x c be such that x and dim x 0 then cx x c x has a general fibre xy which is special of positive dimension with xy the proofs are easy applications of theorem 4 4 proof of 5 5 assume first that x is of general type so the identity map idx of x is a special fibration of general type it is thus the core by 3 8 conversely assume that ess x dim x or what is the same that cx idx and that n dim x 0 so that x is not special there exists then a fibration of general type f x y with m dim y 0 we proceed by induction on n 0 so the assertion holds for manifolds of dimension smaller than n if f is a general fibre of f then f is of general type indeed otherwise we could construct a relative core for f by theorem 12 27 and deduce a nontrivial fibration on x with general fibre special contradicting our initial hypothesis thus f is of general type but now f is a fibration of general type with general fibre itself of general type by theorem 4 4 we get that x is of general type as claimed proof of 5 6 we get first from the preceding argument that dim xy 0 otherwise x n assume that xy 0 from theorem 4 4 again we learn that x dim z xy dim z 0 contradiction in a similar way we can get a very simple description of the next step ess x dim x 1 theorem 5 7 let x c be a manifold of dimension n 0 then ess x n 1 if and only if one of the following two cases occurs a x n 1 and jx is a fibration of general type b r x the rational quotient of x is of dimension n 1 and of general type proof the fact that cases a b imply that ess x n 1 was already shown in 3 12 so assume cx x 99 kc x has n 1 dimensional image let f be the generic fibre of cx it is a special curve hence rational or elliptic if f is rational then c x r x by the fact that rx dominates cx see 3 23 thus r x is n 1 dimensional moreover we get from 3 5 that r x is moishezon and so also x is moishezon by c 85 because c r x c x by theorem 3 25 which applies becausex is moishezon we conclude that cr x idr x and so by the preceding theorem 5 5 we infer that r x is of general type as claimed next if f is elliptic then cx jx because jx dominates cx and is obviously dominated by cx if x 0 we show this by induction on n 2 the case of curves is obvious thus x is non special by assumption let f x 99 ky be a fibration of general type and let f be its general fibre by 2 11 we have a factorisation f cx g for a certain fibration g c x 99 ky moreover because of the functoriality properties of the core the restriction of cx to the general fibre xy of f is the core of xy the induction hypothesis thus applies to xy and we get that special varieties and classification theory 55 xy d 1 if d dim xy and also that jxy which is the restriction of cx to xy is a fibration of general type we are thus in position of applying theorem 4 4 since f is of general type we get first that x xy dim y n 1 then because the general fibres xy of f have nonnegative kodaira dimension we get also from theorem 4 4 that jx is of general type since so is its restriction to the general fibre of f the next step classification of cases when ess x n 2 is similar but some cases would require the general case of corbgt 5 4 the decomposition theorem this is the following asssertion which motivates most of the present paper theorem 5 8 let x be non special then cx is a fibration of general type roughly speaking this means that x decomposes into its special part the fibres of cx and its core or essential part the orbifold c x cx which is either a point or of general type hence the name the decomposition theorem can also be restated in the following form any x c has a fibration both special and of general type this fibration is unique and it is the core of x apply 3 8 to see the last two assertions remark 5 9 we already showed some cases of the preceding theorem 5 8 1 up to dimension 3 as a byproduct of the description of the core given in low dimensions 2 when x is of general type and when ess x dim x in this last case showing that x is of general type is actually the same as showing the decomposition theorem in this case the crucial step was actually applying corbgt this is not an accident we shall show right below that the decomposition conjecture is in fact a consequence of corbgt 3 exactly the same remarks apply to the classification of the cases in which ess x n 1 or n 2 4 we shall show below two consequences of the decomposition theorem c x is moishezon and meromorphic multisections of cx are of general type theorem 5 10 let x c and let ax x alg x be its algebraic reduction there exists a factorisation alg x c x of cx ax alternatively c x is moishezon proof by theorem 2 3 the general fibre of ax is special let us now establish the following weak version of the decomposition theorem 2 7 shows that it is a consequence of this result proposition 5 11 let j z 99 kx be a meromorphic map such that cx j z 99 kc x is surjective and generically finite cx x c x being as usual the core of x c then z is a variety of general type proof by the functoriality of the core and the surjectivity of cx j we get the existence of a factorisation cj c z 99 kc x because cx j cj cz is generically finite so is cz the claim thus follows from 5 5 56 fre de ric campana proof of theorem 5 8 proceed by induction on d ess x when d 0 the result trivially holds so assume it does when ess f d assume that ess x d and that c x 0 by assumption d 0 x is not special so let f x 99 ky be of general type we have by theorem 2 11 a factorisation c x 99 ky of f cx by the characteristic property of the core the restriction of cx to the general fibre xy of f is the core of xy otherwise x would contain special subvarieties strictly larger than the generic fibre of cx a contradiction by the induction hypothesis we conclude that the restriction of cx to the general fibre xy of f is a fibration of general type we conclude from theorem 4 4 that cx itself is a fibration of general type as claimed 5 5 finite e tale covers let us indicate that the decomposition theorem implies the invariance of ess x under finite e tale covers theorem 5 12 let u x x be a finite e tale cover let cu c x c x be the induced map then cu is generically finite in particular ess x is invariant under finite e tale covers and a finite e tale cover of a special manifold is special remark that the proof of this seemingly easy statement requires here fairly deep tools it were interesting to know if there is an easy proof of it proof we can assume that u is galois of group g due to its uniqueness the map cx is g equivariant for an appropriate action of g on c x let h c x c x be the g quotient we have natural maps c x x c x by g invariance and v c x c x since the fibres of c x as images of those of cx by u are special moreover cx v c x by the general properties of cx by the decomposition theorem cx is a fibration of general type and so c x is also of general type by 1 7 from 2 11 we infer the existence of a factorisation w c x c x such that c x w cx thus c x c x and h cu is a finite map 5 6 essential and bogomolov dimensions definition 5 13 for x c let b x max p 0 such that there exists a bogomolov sheaf f p x if there is no bogomolov sheaf on x define b x 0 from 2 26 we see that b x 0 if and only if ess x 0 in general we have corollary 5 14 for any x c we have ess x b x proof let f be any bogomolov sheaf of dimension p 0 on x the associated fibration is thus of general type and so dominated by cx thus ess x p conversely because cx is a fibration of general type the bogomolov sheaf associated to it has p ess x hence the equality let us say that if f g are bogomolov sheaves on x that f dominates g if the fibration f of general type associated to f dominates the fibration g of general type associated to g special varieties and classification theory 57 remark 5 15 the decomposition theorem may then be restated in the following form for any x c ess x b x there exists on x a unique maximum bogomolov sheaf and it is defined by the core of x 5 7 fibre products we answer here the question 2 33 theorem 5 16 let x c and f x 99 ky g x 99 kz be two fibrations of general type let h x 99 kw be the connected part of the stein factorisation of the product map f g x 99 ky z then h is a fibration of general type proof this is an immediate generalisation of the argument in the classical case when y z are themselves of general type indeed let g w 99 kz and f w 99 ky the fibrations such that f f h and g g h by the equality deduced from 4 4 w h wz g z z g g h wz g z dim z we just need to check that the restriction of g xz 99 kwz is of general type for z general in z observe the statement is bimeromorphically invariant we thus assume that z is projective it is certainly moishezon since g is of general type take s z be an intersection of generic hyperpane sections such that g 1 s t w is mapped surjectively and generically finitely onto y by f let v h 1 t x the restrictionfv v 99 ky of f to v has thus the restriction hv v 99 kt of h to v as stein factorisation it is thus a fibration of general type by 2 6 if g t 99 ks has positive dimensional fibres the conclusion follows from 2 9 if not this means that g dominates f in which case the assertion is trivial 5 8 construction of the core as the highest general type fibration we sketch here a second shorter construction of the core it is more abstract avoiding the consideration of chains of special varieties it is something like a reconstruction a posteriori once one already knows from previous more down to earth work the existence of the core theorem 5 17 let x c then x admits a fibration both of general type and special this fibration is unique up to equivalence it is the core of x proof everything is clear from 2 11 once the existence is known we know from 5 16 above together with 2 30 that x admits a unique fibration of general type gtx x 99 kgt x wich dominates all general type fibrations with domain x it remains to show that the general fibres of gtx are special assume not from the construction of the relative gt reduction in 2 34 we deduce the existence of a factorisation gtx h g with g x 99 kg and h g 99 kgt x such that the restriction ga xa 99 kga to the general fibre xa a gt x is the gt reduction of xa thus ga is a fibration of general type since xa is assumed to be nonspecial but then we get from theorem 5 8 that g x 99 kg is a fibration of general type this contradicts the facts that dim g dim gt x by hypothesis and that gtx dominates any fibration of general type defined on x 6 geometric conjectures we shall state in this section some conjectures or questions naturally arising from our previous considerations 58 fre de ric campana 6 1 orbifold rational connectedness we consider in this section an orbifold y d with y c compact smooth and d an orbifold divisor of normal crossings on y we define several variants of rational connectedness directly adapted from the non orbifold case if g y d z is a fibration we define its orbifold base z g d as in section 1 6 if g is only meromorphic we replace y d by a terminal modification y d y d such that g g is holomorphic and then define the orbifold base of g to be that of g we then define z g d as the minimum of the kodaira dimensions of the orbifold bases so obtained the orbifold general fibre of g y d z is defined as the orbifold yz dz with yz the general fibre of g and dz i d where i yz y is the inclusion map an orbifold rational curve on y d is an irreducible rational curve c on y such that c k c n d where n c c is the normalisation map definition 6 1 we say that y d is 1 uniruled if it is covered by a family of curves whose generic member is an orbifold rational curve 2 rationally connected if two generic points of y can be joined by a chain of orbifold rationall curves 3 rationally generated if for any fibration g y d 99 kz the orbifold base of some holo morphic model of g is uniruled 4 rationally connected if for any fibration g y d 99 kz z g d we note as usual for short r c resp r g resp k rg for rationally connected resp rationally generated resp rationally generated notice that r g was introduced in c 95 in the non orbifold context and that the notion of rational generatedness is directly inspired from the definition of in the same paper actually one can even define definition 6 2 for y d as above define y d max z g d where g runs through all fibrations g y d 99 kz as above then rational generatedness is defined by the equality remark 6 3 one can also introduce in the orbifold case many other invariants based on the vanishing of holomorphic covariant tensors which conjecturally characterise rational connect edness we do not do this here because one needs first to define these notions in the orbifold case so we introduced only the simplest one one could for example define y d max y f where f ranges over all rank one coherent subsheaves of y log d see section 2 6 for this notion another variant of orbifold rational connectedness would be defined by y d standard arguments that we do not need to reproduce easily show proposition 6 4 for any orbifold y d as above one has 1 y d if y d is uniruled 2 y d is r g if it is r c anf is k rg if it is r g the reverse implications depend on the answers to the following two questions special varieties and classification theory 59 question 6 5 1 assume y d is then y d uniruled 2 let g y d p 1 be a fibration with generic orbifold fibre rationally connected and such that p 1 g d does g have a section that is an orbifold rational curve mapped isomorphically to p 1 by g of course the second question is directly inspired from g h s again standard arguments show that if question 1 has a positive answer then r g and k r g are equivalent if question 2 has a positive answer then r c and r g are equivalent properties remark 6 6 question 1 seems quite delicate if true it is open in the non orbifold case it is open even in the surface case dim y 2 and seems to present great subtlety it is similar to the case handled in k mk of log del pezzo surfaces with a reduced boundary d but their methods might apply to treat the above surface case remark 6 7 another natural question in this context is whether the glueing lemma of ko mi mo extends to this context for example can one add to an orbifold rational curve c in y d sufficiently many free orbifold rational curves if y d is uniruled in such a way that the union deforms to an irreducible orbifold rational curve we shall now justify the introduction of the notion of generatedness by showing that it permits to define the notion of rational quotient even in the orbifold case without solving question 1 above this definition however depends on the solution of conjecture corbn m conjecture 6 8 conjecture assume that y d there exists then a unique fibration ry d y 99 kr y d such that 1 the general orbifold fibre fr yr dr r r y d of ry d has yr dr 2 r y d ry d d 0 proposition 6 9 a fibration as in 6 8 is unique if it exists the existence follows from conjec ture corbn m proof assume there exists another fibration h y 99 kz with the same properties let u y 99 kw be the stein factorised product of ry d and h assume h is not equivalent to ry d the restriction hr yr 99 kwr then maps the orbifold fr to a positive dimensional orbifold of nonnegative kodaira dimension by the property 2 assumed to hold for h this contradicts 1 above for ry d and shows unicity for the existence consider the stein factorised product p y 99 kv of all fibrations h y 99 kz such that z h d 0 by corbn m p itself has this property assume the general orbifold fibre of p were not rg we could find by the result on the relative quotients fibrations h y 99 ku and k u 99 kv such that p k h and such that the general orbifold fibre of k had nonnegative kodaira dimension by corbn m again this would imply that u h d 0 but this contradicts the maximality of p among such fibrations since dim u dim v 6 2 orbifold iitaka moishezon fibration the iitaka moishezon fibration of an orbifold y d as in section 6 1 above can be defined without difficulty by considering the linear sys tem m ky d for m sufficiently big and divisible 60 fre de ric campana we shall then denote by jy d y d 99 kj y d the resulting iitaka moishezon fibration by the usual properties of iitaka fibrations one has ys ds 0 for its general orbifold fibre 6 3 orbifold rational quotient and iitaka fibration of a special fibration we describe in this section an alternative construction of the core of an arbitrary x along the program described in the introduction this construction actually coincides in dimensions 2 and 3 with the construction of the core given in 3 30 and 3 37 the idea is quite simple assume we have a special fibration f x 99 ky we try to understand the obstructions to constructing a non trivial h y 99 kz such that g h f x 99 kz is still special this in terms of the invariant y f this will certainly be impossible if f is of general type because then f is the core of x by 3 8 the other cases can actually be reduced as in the classical iitaka moishezon classification pro gram to the cases 0 or and we conjecture below that such a non trivial g then exists this leads to a conjectural decomposition of the core in a canonical and functorial sequence of orbifold rational and iitaka fibrations first we need to give an orbifold generalisation of iitaka fibrations and rational quotients for special fibrations we consider in the sequel a special fibration f x 99 ky thus with x c theorem 6 10 assume that y f 0 then x is special proof this follows from 4 4 and its corollaries assume indeed x were not special by 2 11 there would exists a fibration g y 99 kz such that g f x 99 kz were of general type but then we would have 1 yz fz 0 because y f 0 by the easy addition theorem 2 0 y f yz fz dim z dim z 0 because of 1 contradiction from this result we deduce immediately the notion of iitaka fibration of the special fibration f x 99 ky it is just the fibration jf y j f associated to the q divisor ky f first replacing f by any of its admissible models alternatively it is also the iitaka moishezon fibration of the orbifold base y f of any of its admissible prepared models the important property is that the general orbifold fibre of jf has kodaira dimension zero by the remarks made in section 6 2 above from this follows immediately using 6 10 that the composite fibration j f f x 99 kj f is special next we need to investigate the case when y f using the preceding conjecture 6 8 we get conjecture 6 11 let f x 99 ky be special fibration with y f there exists a unique fibration rf y f 99 kr f such that 1 the general orbifold fibre of rf is rationally generated 2 r f rf f r f rf f 0 we call rf the rational quotient of f notice that assuming the existence of rf we have dim r f dim y and that f 1 yr xr is then special for r r f general special varieties and classification theory 61 by a slight extension of the definition we also define the rational quotient rf of f to be the identity map of y if y f 0 caution the iitaka base fibration resp the rational base quotient differ from the relative iitaka fibration resp rational quotient of f which are defined for any fibration f and provide a factorisation of f inducing on the general fibre of f the corresponding fibration of that fibre of course if the questions 6 5 have a positive answer the general orbifold fibre of rf is rationally conected 6 4 the core as an iterated orbifold rational quotients and iitaka fibrations we assume in this section the conjecture 6 8 definition 6 12 special reduction of a special fibration let f x y be a special fibration assume that the above conjecture 6 8 hold define sf jrf rf y 99 kj rf f s f and call it the first special reduction of f in vague terms sf is obtained by first applying rf to y and then j rf f to r f rf f notice that sf x s f has still its general fibre special so the construction can be iterated and we get a sequence of special fibrations s 0 f idy with y s 0 f and then inductively sk 1 f ssk f x sk 1 f we call skf the kth special reduction of f notice that sf f exactly when y f dim y 0 in this case by 3 8 f is the core of x and it is the constant map iff y f dim y 0 from this we immediately deduce the following by applying the above iteration starting with f idx the identity map of x thus getting the sequence of k th special reductions of x theorem 6 13 assume that the conjecture 6 8 holds let x c with n dim x define skx s k idx x sk x sk idx k 0 then snx cx the core of x and cx is thus either constant or a fibration of general type of course in general the sequence of fibrations skx will be stationary before its n th term is reached definition 6 14 for x c and k 0 define sk x dim sk x and rsk x dim r skx where rsk x sk x r skx is the rational quotient of skx x sk x the kth special reduction of x under the said conjecture these are new bimeromorphic invariants of x we call sk x the kth special dimension of x and rsk x the reduced kth special dimension of x standard easy arguments give proposition 6 15 assume that the conjecture 6 8 holds the invariants sk x and rsk x are invariant under finite e tale covers u x x of x the same holds for the associated fibrations skx resp rs k x is the stein factorisation of s k x u resp rskx u one has the following strictness property for the core decomposition which we quote without proof theorem 6 16 assume that conjecture 6 8 holds let x c and let k j 0 be integers let s resp r be the general fibre of skx resp rs k x the restrictions of s j x and rs j x to s and r coincide respectively with s j s rs j s s j r and rs j r 62 fre de ric campana remark 6 17 the sequence s of 2 n 2 integers dim x n s 0 rs 0 s 1 rs 1 sk rsk sn rsn partitions the class of n dimensional manifolds in c into a certain finite number c n of classes according to the number of steps and the dimensions of the steps needed to decompose the core in orbifold rational quotients and iitaka fibrations one has for example c 0 1 c 1 3 c 2 8 c 3 21 by direct listing one can easily compute the numbers c n as follows say a sequence s is special if its last term is zero notice the sequence is stationary precisely if two consecutive terms rsk sk 1 coincide or if one is zero we say the sequence s ends at j resp r if sk rsk rsk 1 resp sk 1 rsk sk let s n be the number of special sequences of n dimensional manifolds let s n resp s n be the number of such special sequences which end at r resp j thus s n s n s n we quote without proof lemma 6 18 one has for any n 0 1 c n m 0 1 n s m 2 s n 1 h 1 n 1 s h 3 s n 1 h 1 2 n 1 s h because s 0 1 s 1 s 1 1 s 1 2 c 1 3 we get inductively s 2 2 s 2 3 s 2 5 c 2 8 for example we already met these classes actually when listing the possibilities for the core of a surface corollary 6 19 for all n 0 one has 1 s n 1 s n s n 1 2 s n s n 1 2 s n 1 3 s n s n 1 c n 1 c n s n 1 and finally corollary 6 20 if 3 5 2 and 3 5 2 one has for all n 0 1 s n 1 5 2 5 n 5 1 2 5 n 2 c n n 1 n 1 5 6 5 deformation invariance we next state the following for x c smooth conjecture 6 21 deformation conjecture ess x is a deformation invariant of x in par ticular the class of special manifolds is stable under deformation one may ask more precise versions does the core of x vary holomorphically with x for suitable models even weaker versions are difficult is ess x upper or lower semi continuous under smooth de formations is it lower semi continuous under degenerations the following is important and maybe accessible is a degeneration of special manifolds still special in the sense that all of its irreducible components are special special varieties and classification theory 63 a more refined version of the above deformation conjecture is the following which extends the classical conjecture concerning the deformation invariance of the kodaira dimension for compact ka hler manifolds question 6 22 assume that the conjecture hold let x c are the invariants sk x and rsk x deformation invariants of x more precisely do the associated fibrations vary holomorphically for suitable models when deforming x notice that this is the case for k 0 and in the projective case and deformation among projective manifolds for s 1 x by the invariance of plurigenera due to y t siu siu a slightly less general version but which deals with invariants known to exist is the following concerning the higher kodaira dimensions defined in 3 6 question 6 23 let x be compact ka hler assume the invariants x x r x are defined are then these invariants defined also and constant for small deformations of x of course one could still extend the preceding questions to the category of orbifolds appropriately defined 6 6 weakly special manifolds definition 6 24 x c is said to be weakly special or w special for short if there is no pair u f in which u x x is a finite e tale covering and f x 99 ky is a surjective meromorphic map onto a manifold y of general type in the usual sense and positive dimension from 1 7 we get proposition 6 25 if x is special it is w special proof it is the same as in 2 33 assume by contradiction that a triple u x f as in the preceding definition exists we can assume the cover u to be galois of group g if f is g equivariant then f descends to f x 99 ky y g and f is of general type by 1 7 otherwise just replace f by the least upper bound f of the finite family f g g g now f is g equivariant and maps x to y which is of general type by 2 29 example 6 26 all the examples listed in 2 2 are thus w special notice that contrary to the case of special manifolds it is obvious that any finite e tale cover of a w special manifold is again w special in particular any finite e tale cover of a special manifold is w special conversely it follows from 3 32 that special surfaces and are weakly special the same assertion for threefolds is expected to have a negative answer more generally question 6 27 does there exist manifolds which are w special but not special although it seems reasonable to expect a positive answer the construction of such examples is far from being immediate the following has been shown in 5 3 64 fre de ric campana proposition 6 28 let x be w special the albanese map of x is then surjective and connected in particular if x is special and x is a finite e tale cover of x the albanese map of x is surjective and connected observe that in contrast to the case x special this result does not assert that the albanese map of x is multiplicity free if x is w special thus if x is w special but its albanese map has multiple fibres in codimension one x cannot be special the core as a weak analogue described below 6 7 the weak version of the core it is possible to construct an analogue of the core for weakly special manifolds and fibrations strongly of general type we briefly indicate how to do this the proofs are much easier than in the case of the actual core and will be omitted because of being straightforward applications of standards results concerning the classical not orbifold kodaira dimension these notions will not be used anyway but it seems worth mentioning them for sake of completeness definition 6 29 we say that the fibration f x 99 ky with y c is of strong general type if there exists a finite e tale cover u x x such that y is of general type where f u v f is the stein factorisation of f u here f x 99 ky is connected and v y y is finite thus x is weakly special iff it has no fibration f x y of strong general type notice that by 1 7 a fibration of strong general type is of general type proposition 6 30 let f x y and g x z be two fibrations of strong general type let h x v be the stein factorisation of the product map f g x w y z then h is of strong general type corollary 6 31 for x c there exists a unique fibration gt x x gt x which is of strong general type and dominates in the obvious sense any fibration of strong general type f x y we call it the strong general type reduction of x it is thus the constant map iff x is weakly special corollary 6 32 for x c there is a unique wx c x gt x such that gt x wx cx if cx x c x is the core of x proof by 2 11 if f x y is a fibration of general type there is a unique factorisation c x y such that f cx apply this to f gt x which is of general type since of strong general type remark 6 33 1 the general type reduction gtx x gt x of x see 2 30 dominates gt x and is dominated by cx 2 for any fibration f x y it is possible to construct a relative strong general type reduction of f as in the general type case 3 applying the above reduction to f gt x we would get that the general fibre of gt x is weakly special provided one could show the following if g f x z is of strong general type special varieties and classification theory 65 and if so is the restriction fz xz yz of f x y to the general fibre xz of g f then f x y is of strong general type this statement seems however very unplausible it would be much better to have counterexam ples which is why we were led to consider the more complicated notion of special varieties and general type fibrations 4 as d abramovitch informed me in ab a reduction map analogous to the preceding gt x was constructed but with fibrations onto general type varieties in place of strong general type fibrations ie ignoring e tale covers inspired by harris conjecture it enjoys nice properties but is very unstable with respect to finite e tale covers which however preserve kobayashi pseudo metric and the arithmetic behaviour 6 8 classical gcd multiplicities we can still introduce a third notion of special manifolds which interpolates between the preceding two ones it is based on the classical definition of multiple fibres using gcd instead of inf we shall be brief on this definition 6 34 let f x y be a fibration and let y be an irreducible reduced divisor let f j j mj dj r where f dj j while f r has codimension two or more in y define multiplicities as follows m f gcd mj j j and m f min mj j j obviously m divides m now using this definition of multiplicity one can define exactly as we did with the same proofs the notion of base orbifold and kodaira dimension of a fibration this leads to the gcd versions of fibration of general type and special manifold the gcd core can be constructed also with the same properties one property only is possibly lost gcd fibrations of general type are no longer naturally in bijective correspondance with bogomolov sheaves on the other hand the additivity result 4 4 and its proof even becoming slightly simpler at a point remain so it may happen that the gcd core is still a fibration of gcd general type at this point one may wonder 1 are the two theories actually different 2 if yes which one is the right one presently there is no counterexample to distinguish them but it seems plausible that the two theories differ we shall make some general easy comparisons between them right below concerning the second question b above assuming a positive answer to a it seems that the version given here with inf not gcd is the right one this is supported by the correspondance with bogomolov sheaves and the direct link between inf fibrations of general type and geometric positivity properties of cotangent sheaves this link between geometry and positivity is the main theme of classification theory other impressions support this choice of inf versus gcd the inf notion is better suited for the study of kobayashi pseudo metric also one may expect on the arithmetic side the fact that gcd special manifolds are not always potentially dense the only feature in favour of the gcd theory is that it is better suited for the computation of the fundamental group this property cannot however compensate the other drawbacks let us end up with some obvious remarks concerning the comparisons between the three notions of specialness introduced 66 fre de ric campana a special manifold is gcd special because a fibration of general type is of gcd general type a gcd special manifold is w special by the gcd version of 1 7 although no counterexamples are known it seems plausible that the three notions are distinct the easiest counterexample would be a w special but not special threefold the following question is related to the comparison of special and gcd special manifolds a positive answer not necessarily expected would show the coincidence of the two notions question 6 35 assume the general fibre f of f is special is it then true that m f m f for any pair y remark 6 36 it is sufficient to answer the above question when y is a curve and m f 1 one would like to know if one of the m js 1 then the question above is motivated by the fact that it has a positive answer when f is rationally connected by g h s the above assertion being actually the main difficulty in the proof and when f is an abelian variety or a complex torus by an easy argument the addition of local multisections the next interesting case to consider is that of f a k 3 surface or a special surface with 1 the answer does not seem to be known in these cases 6 9 irreducible special manifolds definition 6 37 let x c be a special connected manifold we say x is irreducible special resp strongly irreducible special if it is special and if every fibration f x y resp covering family vt t t of x with general fibre special resp special general member vt is trivial ie has fibre or base dimension zero resp if vt has dimension or codimension zero in x examples if x is rationally connected of dimension 2 or more it is not strongly irreducible special but it is possible that some rationally connected threefolds necessarily bimeromorphic to some terminal q fano threefolds with picard number one may be irreducible special the answer does not seem to be known the general quintic threefold is strongly irreducible because not generically covered by images of elliptic curves or abelian surfaces remark 6 38 if x is irreducible special then x 0 or by 3 10 5 1 and the iitaka moishezon fibration recall the standard uniruledness conjecture if x then x is uniruled observe that it is obviously equivalent to irreducibility conjecture if x and if x is special of dimension n 2 then x is not strongly irreducible special 6 10 manifolds with nef anticanonical bundle question let x be a ka hler manifold with kx nef see d p s for this notion is then x special a positive answer to this question would imply most of the conjectures concerning these manifolds special varieties and classification theory 67 certain important consequences of a positive answer to this question have been established q zhang has shown in zh the surjectivity of the albanese map in the projective case and m paun has shown in the difficult ka hler case see pa the virtual nilpotency of the fundamental group combined with q zhang s result and c 4 it shows that if x is projective and has nef anticanonical bundle then it has virtually abelian fundamental group 7 the fundamental group 7 1 the abelianity conjecture our considerations here are guided by the following conjecture 7 1 let x be special then 1 x is virtually abelian recall that a group is said to be virtually abelian one also says almost abelian if it has a subgroup of finite index which is abelian this conjecture is motivated by the fact that it should be true for klt orbifolds either rationally connected or with 0 and the fact that a special manifold should be after section 6 4 a tower of orbifold fibrations with orbifold fibres in the preceding two classes see section 9 4 for the motivation of a similar conjecture concerning the kobayashi pseudo metric examples 7 2 1 curves a curve is special iff its fundamental group is virtually abelian 2 rationally connected manifolds they have trivial fundamental group c 3 c 5 ko mi mo and are special more generally if rx is the rational quotient of x see 12 26 then it induces an isomorphism between the fundamental groups of x and r x by ko so that x and r x are simultaneously special and have simultaneously virtually abelian fundamental groups the above conjecture should thus essentially reduces to the case where x 0 if the uniruledness conjecture is true 3 manifolds with a x 0 or with x 0 are special and standard conjectures say they should have a virtually abelian fundamental group these conjectures are thus special cases of conjecture i above notice that conjecture 7 1 is established for manifolds with c 1 x 0 which are indeed special and have almost abelian fundamental group by the calabi yau theorem this provides strong support for and motivates the case where 0 let us give another example of result supporting conjecture 7 1 in the case a x 0 theorem 7 3 c 95 let x c be such that a x 0 and x ox 6 0 then 1 x is finite in particular conjecture 7 1 holds for x more generally if f is the generic fibre of the algebraic reduction map of any x c with x ox 6 0 the image in 1 x of 1 f is finite recall that f is special by 2 3 4 surfaces and threefolds by 3 32 and 3 38 conjecture 7 1 holds for ka hler surfaces and projective threefolds with 6 2 and more precisely for all special threefolds except maybe for the ones with 2 and having a model of the iitaka moishezon fibration with orbifold base a log enriques or log fano normal surface in this case the conjecture is open because of an insufficient knowledge of these orbifolds 68 fre de ric campana this case shows clearly that the solution of conjecture 7 1 above should be extended to the orbifold situation recall that the fundamental group of y is defined as the quotient of the fundamental group of the complement of in y modulo the normal subgroup generated by elements of the form jmj where j is a small loop winding once aroud j if j j 1 1 mj j question 7 4 let y be a klt orbifold with y normal assume that ky is ample or torsion is then the fundamental group of y trivial in the first case and almost abelian in the second case more generally is the fundamental group of y almost abelian if y 0 or if y is rationally generated see section 6 1 for this notion notice that a positive answer for surfaces solves the remaining cases of the abelianity conjecture in dimension three 5 manifolds with kx nef are conjectured to have a virtually abelian fundamental group this conjecture is thus also a consequence of conjecture 7 1 under a positive answer to the question asked above of whether such manifolds are special the main results concerning this conjecture are in d p s d p s pa and zh 6 ka hler manifolds x covered by cd are special by the results of the next section 8 2 and s iitaka conjectured them to be covered by complex tori easy arguments given below show that this happens precisely if 1 x is virtually abelian so this conjecture is also a special case of the abelianity conjecture above we are not presently able to solve substantial examples of the abelianity conjecture but at least the solvable and linear quotients of the fundamental group can be dealt with 7 2 linear and solvable quotients recall first 5 3 theorem 7 5 let x be any finite e tale cover of a special manifold let x x alb x be the albanese map of x then it is surjective connected moreover x has no multiple fibres in codimension one if x is special remark 7 6 due to 5 1 this extends and sharpens slightly a result of kw remark 7 7 assume that conjecture 7 1 holds or alternatively that x is special and has almost abelian fundamental group easy standard arguments then show using the surjectivity of the albanese map and its absence of multiple fibres in codimension one that the universal cover of x is holomorphically convex in accordance with the conjecture of shafarevitch and that its remmert reduction makes it proper over an affine complex space which is the universal cover of its albanese variety now using c 4 see also a n b sim one gets corollary 7 8 let x c be special and let c x x to be an e tale finite cover then 1 the derived group d 1 x of x is finitely generated 2 the green lazarsfeld set 1 x consists of finitely many torsion characters of 1 x special varieties and classification theory 69 again using c 4 corollary 4 2 based on deligne s semi simplicity and invariant cycle theorems and 7 5 we get theorem 7 9 if x is w special and if 1 x g is a surjective morphism of groups with g solvable and torsionfree then g is virtually abelian we say that torsionfree solvable quotients of 1 x are almost abelian proof this is an easy consequence of 7 5 which says that the albanese map of x is surjective and connected and of corollary 4 2 of c 4 which says that if the albanese map ofx is surjective for any finite e tale cover x of x then the conclusion of 7 9 is true for x remark this applies in particular when a x 0 it is shown by a different method in c 4 and when x 0 now using a result of z itself based on results of n mok mk see also siu and 7 9 we get theorem 7 10 let x be w special and let 1 x gl n c be a linear representation then g image is virtually abelian we say that linear quotients of 1 x are almost abelian so counter examples to conjecture 7 1 if any can t be detected by linear representations of their fundamental groups proof let g be the zariski closure of g replacing x by a suitable e tale cover we assume that g is connected we have an exact sequence of groups 1 r g s 1 with s semi simple and r solvable consider the representation 1 x s where g s is the above quotient by z thm 5 p 105 we get that s is trivial ie reduced to the unit element thus g r is solvable and can be assumed to be torsionfree passing to a suitable finite e tale cover by a selberg s theorem the conclusion now follows from 7 9 corollary 7 11 conjecture 7 1 holds when 1 x is linear ie has a faithfull representation 7 3 manifolds covered by cn an easy consequence of 7 10 is theorem 7 12 let x c be covered by cd so d dim x assume that 1 x is either solvable or linear ie admits a faithful linear representation in some gl n c then x is covered by a complex torus ie s iitaka s conjecture then holds for x proof we know that x is special by 8 2 below one can also get directly from k o that x is w special which is sufficient for our purpose thus 1 x is virtually abelian by 7 9 or 7 10 above replacing x by a suitable unramified cover the conclusion thus follows from the next lemma 7 13 lemma 7 13 let x c be covered by cd with d dim x assume that 1 x is abelian then x is a complex torus 70 fre de ric campana proof let x a be the albanese map of x by 7 5 it is surjective and connected let f be a generic fibre of it is sufficient to show that dim f 0 because x is covered by cd indeed is then birational and so x contains a rational curve if is not isomorphic but this rational curve would lift after normalisation to the universal cover of x a contradiction assume dim f 0 then image 1 f 1 y would be infinite again because cd does not contain positive dimensional subvarieties because 1 x is abelian this implies by dualising that the restriction map h 0 x 1 x h 0 f 1 f is nonzero a contradiction to the fact that f is a fibre of we can slightly extend 7 10 to the relative case which shows that interesting linear representations of 1 x x c come from the core theorem 7 14 let x c let cx x c x be its core with f its generic fibre and let 1 gl n c be a linear representation let g resp h be the image of 1 x by resp the intersection with g of the zariski closure of the image h of 1 f by then h is normal in g almost abelian and there is a natural quotient linear representation 1 c x g h gl n c where c x is a suitable finite e tale cover of c x proof this is an immediate consequence of 7 10 using the well known fact c 2 for example that in the situation of 7 14 if k ker 1 x 1 c x then 1 f x k and the quotient group is generated by torsion elements thus if k k since h is almost abelian by 7 10 and the quotient group g h is linear by standard linear algebraic group theory we have an embedding g h gl n c for some n and we see that k h is the trivial group by a selberg s theorem provided we replaced x by some suitable finite e tale cover we thus get then an isomorphic morphism of groups g k g h which gives the asserted representation 8 an orbifold generalisation of kobayashi ochiai s extension theorem 8 1 statements we give here an orbifold version of a famous extension theorem due to kobayashi ochiai k o the setting considered in all of this section 8 is the following notation 8 1 v be a connected complex manifold d a reduced divisor on v and u v d let u 99 kx be a meromorphic map with x c we always assume f u 99 ky is nondegenerate ie has maximal rank p dim y somewhere let f x 99 ky be a fibration with p dim y our main result here is theorem 8 2 let v u x y f be as above assume f is a fibration of general type then a extends meromorphically to v 99 ky b for any m 0 sufficiently divisible and s h 0 y m ky f s extends to s h 0 v pv m m 1 d special varieties and classification theory 71 remark 8 3 the result of kobayashi ochiai is the special case where x y so that x is of general type the proof will be given in the next sections it is an orbifold modification of the original proof of k o we shall first give some applications of this result which are criteria of transcendental nature for certain varieties to be special definition 8 4 let u v d be the complement of a reduced divisor d in the connected complex manifold v say that the pair v d is log special if for p 0 there is no rank one coherent subsheaf l pv and no m 0 such that the complete linear system defined by h 0 v ml m 1 d is of general type ie defines a meromorphic map of maximal rank p as a first application we immediately get from 8 2 corollary 8 5 let u v d be the complement of the divisor d in the connected complex manifold v let u 99 kx be nondegenerate assume that the pair v d is log special then x is special we now consider the case when v x and d is empty so the extension part of 8 2 is certainly trivial observe that the pair v d x 0 is log special precisely if there is no bogomolov sheaf on x we however recover one direction of 2 26 corollary 8 6 assume that x has no bogomolov sheaf then x is special to get some concrete applications we take more restrictive conditions than log specialness definition 8 7 let u v d be the complement of a reduced divisor d in the connected complex manifold v say that the pair v d is log rc for log rationally connected if h 0 v p v m m 1 d vanishes for any m 0 of course if v d is log rc it is log special if v is projective rationally connected and d is empty the pair v d is log rc one easily checks the following shown in a generalised form below example 8 8 the pair pn pn 1 is log rc from 8 2 we get corollary 8 9 assume that the pair v d is log rc then x is special specialising from example 8 8 we get the definition 8 10 say that x is cd dominable resp covered by cd if there exists cd 99 kx nondegenerate resp if the universal cover of x is isomorphic to cd the terminology cd dominable is from b l from 8 9 we then deduce corollary 8 11 let x c be cd dominable then x is special in particular if x is covered by cd then x is special 72 fre de ric campana remark that manifolds x c covered by cd are conjectured by s iitaka to be covered by a torus ie to have a finite e tale cover which is a torus this is shown to be true for surfaces in i 2 and for threefolds in c z for x projective of arbitrary dimension this follows see c z from the standard conjectures of the minimal model program see 7 12 for another case where this conjecture is known to hold true we now give a geometric criterion for the pair v d to be log rc this criterion may explain the name log rc and shows that being log rc may be seen as a transcendental analogue of rational connectedness definition 8 12 we say the pair v d is h special if there exists a meromorphic map u 99 kx where u w c with w quasi projective and moreover such that is holomorphic and constant at the generic point of w 0 ie w 0 a for some fixed a x and any w w example 8 13 the pair pn pn 1 is h special blow up a point outside of pn 1 to see this proposition 8 14 the pair v d is log rc if it is h special the easy but lengthy proof is deferred to section 8 8 below although the following clearly results from the preceding observations we state it separately corollary 8 15 let x c be h special then x is special remark 8 16 due to 8 2 and in this situation it is tempting to ask if x is special when v itself is special this is not true because transcendental holomorphic maps do not preserve multiplicities along d the following example shows this example 8 17 let b e be elliptic curves and ai b be distinct points i 1 4 let b be the complement of these points in b let v e b and u e b v let now m 2 be an integer let now x be obtained from v by applying to v the four logarithmic transformations of multiplicity m respectively to its fibres e ai over b then x is projective and contains u as a zariski open subset however v is special while x is not so the specialness of v does not imply that of x even when is the embedding of a zariski open subset of both v and x except when x is a curve as observed by m zaidenberg this is an immediate consequence of k o 8 2 sketch of proof of the kobayashi ochiai s extension theorem we shall very briefly first sketch the proof of the classical result of kobayashi ochiai and then indicate in section 8 6 the changes needed to obtain the orbifold version we consider here only the extension part of the statement ie the fact that extends meromor phically to v the second part the control of the order of poles of s is shown in section 8 7 by a lemma of independent interest recall we want to show that if u v d 99 ky is nondegenerate then extends meromor phically to v provided y is of general type the idea is thus that maps to general type varieties do not have essential singularities this is analogous to the fact that a bounded function on the special varieties and classification theory 73 unit disc minus the origin extends across the origin now general type manifolds behave like manifolds with universal cover a bounded domain in the sense that they admit pseudo volume forms with negative ricci form the proof as explained in kob chap 7 goes in several steps 1 it is sufficient to deal with the special case v dp d 0 dp 1 so that u dp 0 dp 1 d p this is simply because meromorphic maps to a projective variety or even a ka hler manifold extend meromorphically across codimension 2 or more analytic subsets the case where dim v p can be reduced to the equidimensional case see kob p 374 75 notations for future reference we denote by d r the disk of radius r centered at 0 in c by d d 1 the unit disk dp r and d p r are constructed as dp and d p above replacing d by d r 2 because y is of general type it has a pseudo volume form w of ricci curvature negative bouded from above by a constant 1 c 0 this form is constructed out of a basis of a linear subsystem l of m ky giving an embedding of y into some projective space once its fixed components have been removed another property used in the proof is that if wj is the pseudo volume form associated to a single element of the basis of l above the quotient wj w is a smooth function on y this function is thus bounded these notions and constructions are explained in more detail in section 8 4 below 3 an elementary lemma see 8 22 below together withe argument exposed in 5 below show that the special case 1 above is true if one shows that w being the preceding pseudo volume form on y then the integral of w converges on d p 1 2 4 by the celebrated ahlfors schwarz lemma see 8 21 below we have the estimate w c if is the homogeneous volume form on d p with constant ricci curvature 1 and c is the positive constant of 2 above one concludes from the elementary fact that has finite volume on d p 1 2 5 let us now conclude the proof in the equidimensional case the forms wj sj of the linear system m ky extend meromorphically to d p by the steps 2 3 4 5 but the map is defined by the n tuple of maps w 0 w 1 wn with values in p n the map itself thus extends meromorphically to dp as claimed we shall refer to kob for the details not given here for the main points 2 3 4 we shall introduce the basic definitions and properties in the sections 8 4 and 8 3 below finally the proof of the orbifold version will be given in section 8 6 the proof of point b in the statement of theorem 8 2 will be given in the separate section 8 7 below although it might possibly be deduced from kob which contains a similar result in implicit form we prefer to give an independent more general statement 8 3 pseudo volume and ricci forms we need to recall some classical notions see for example kob chapters 1 and 7 for more details let m be a complex manifold we say that v is a pseudo volume form with holomorphic degeneracies onm if it is a form of type p p onm with p dim m such that locally in any coordinate system x 1 xp x one has v a 2 t vol x with vol x ip 2 d x d x a 74 fre de ric campana is a holomorphic nonzero function and t a smooth ie c everywhere positive function locally defined on m for such a form v its ricci form is the real 1 1 form ricci v ddc logt i logt and its ricci function is kv ricci v m v both are well defined independently of local coordinates because changing charts multiplies t by the square of the modulus of the jacobian the log of which has vanishing ddc from the definitions one gets also immediately the functoriality of these notions if f n m is a dominant holomorphic map with p dim n and if v f v then the definitions apply to v and one has both ricci v f ricci v and kv f kv remark 8 18 the ricci form is thus the special case for km of the notion of curvature form of a singular hermitian metric on a line bundle neglecting the singular part cohomologically significant however of the curvature current assume that v has holomorphic degeneracies then we say that v has negatively bounded ricci curvature if ricci v is an everywhere positive or zero 1 1 form and if kv c for some constant c 0 everywhere on m observe that kv is then nonpositive from the condition on ricci v and that kv may take the value at points where a vanishes note that if m is compact and ricci v everywhere positive then v has negatively bounded ricci curvature observe too that v has negatively bounded ricci curvature if and only if so has v for v f v as above example 8 19 we give the examples used in the proof as said above these are bounded domains 1 the unit disc take in the linear coordinates v idx dx 1 x 2 2 then ricci v v and kv 1 2 the unit disc with origin removed d take in the linear coordinates v idx dx x 2 log x 2 2 one again has ricci v v and kv 1 actually the forms in the preceding two examples correspond under the universal covering map from d to d this can be checked explicitely using the poincare upper half plane as an intermediate step an important property used in the proof is that d r v if r 1 of course the domain over which the integral is taken is the disc of radius r with origin deleted 3 m d p take in the linear coordinates v ip 2 dx dx x 1 2 log x 1 2 2 2 j p 1 xj 2 2 one again has ricci v v and kv 1 again one has d p r v the above volume forms have thus negatively bounded ricci function we give in the next section the example used in the proof in an essential way 8 4 pseudo volume forms on varieties of general type let y be a p dimensional man ifold of general type that is with ky big from kodaira s lemma for m large enough we can write mky h a with h effective and a very ample special varieties and classification theory 75 let l be a free linear subsystem of the complete linear system a such that the associated regular map y pn n diml is an embedding let s s 0 s 1 sn be a complex basis of h l and h a section of oy h vanishing exactly on h define w j 0 n i m p 2 sj sj 1 m then w is a pseudo volume form with holomorphic degeneracies along h since it is written in local coordinates as w a 2 v 1 with w 1 j 0 n tj 2 1 m vol x if a is a local equation for h and sj tj vol x m j using the notation introduced in section 8 2 above notice that l being free w 1 is a smooth volume form on y we now compute its ricci form by its very definition we have ricci w where is up to a positive constant the curvature form of the fubini study metric on the tautological line bundle opn 1 this is in accordance with remark 8 18 the ricci form od w is just since the singular part of the metric is given by h the ricci form of w is thus negative everywhere as a consequence kw ricci w p v is negative everywhere and on h by the compactness of y we conclude that this function is negatively bounded by some constant 1 c for some c 0 remark 8 20 for j 0 n define wj im p 2 sj sj 1 m this is still a pseudo volume form with holomorphic degeneracies on y the function wj w is obviously smooth on y and thus bounded there exists b 0 such that wj b w j 0 n 8 5 the lemma of ahlfors schwarz despite its simplicity it is a very powerful tool to obtain bounds on the growth of pseudo volume forms we give the simplest version sufficient for our applications lemma 8 21 let v be a pseudo volume form with holomorphic degeneracies on d p assume that kv 1 c 0 everywhere on d p then v where is the volume form on d p with constant ricci function 1 defined in example 8 19 3 above sketch of proof see kob 2 4 14 for details one can reduce by introducing the volume forms relative to polyradii r 1 to the case when the quotient smooth function k v has a maximum at an interior point b of the closure of d p obviously v does not vanish at b the real 1 1 form ddc logk i logk is then nonnegative at b by functoriality it is sufficient to check this on a complex parametrised curve but then i logk 2 logk s 2 2 logk t 2 ds dt in real coordinates x s it and the claim follows rescaling v we assume that c 1 now i logk i logv i logb ricci ricci v 0 if v b are the functions such that v v vol x and b vol x we get ricci ricci v hence also v kv v ricci p ricci v p k and the conclusion follows we now state an extension criterion which is used crucially in the proof proposition 8 22 let s h 0 d p m kd p be such that d p r im p 2 s s 1 m for some r 1 then s extends to a meromorphic section of mkdp moreover the poles of this extension are of order at most m 1 along 0 dp 1 76 fre de ric campana the proof is given in kob 7 5 7 8 the proof reduces to the case when p 1 and the elementary fact that a holomorphic function on the punctured unit disc which is l 2 m on some d r r 1 extends meromorphically with a pole of order at most m 1 8 6 proof of the orbifold version setting we consider in this section the following data f x 99 ky is a fibration of general type u 99 kx is a meromorphic map which is dominant ie submersive at some point x v are connected complex manifolds with x compact and j u v is a zariski dense open subset complement of some divisor d of v let f u 99 ky blowing up x and y if needed we shall assume that f is holomorphic that y is projective and that f is high see 4 1 we let p 0 be the dimension of y and f be the multiplicity divisor for f as defined in 1 1 4 our purpose here is to establish that extends meromorphically to v proposition 8 23 let m 0 be an integer such that m is cartier then 1 f defines an injection of sheaves f oy m ky px m after suitable modifications of x and y 2 in particular let s h 0 y m ky then f s h 0 x px m recall y has dimension p proof just as in the proof of 4 20 because we have an injection of sheaves also denoted f f oy m ky px m it is sufficient to check the above injection outside a codimension two subvariety of x provided f is high so we first assume that we are near in the analytic topology the generic point of i but the assertion follows here from an easy local computation indeed mi divides m m mi by assumption and we can choose local coordinates x x 1 xd near the generic point of the divisor di x a component of f 1 i mapped surjectively to i by f in such a way that in suitable local coordinates y y 1 yp near the corresponding generic point of i one has f x y y 1 yp with y 1 x 1 mi m and yj xj for j 1 with m some appropriate nonnegative integer local equations for di and i being respectively x 1 0 and y 1 0 thus we get a local generator of f oy m ky in the form f d y y 1 1 mi 1 m and this expression is equal to f d y m y m m 1 x mi m 1 m mi m m m 1 d x m x 1 m m d x m up to a nonzero constant factor where d y dy 1 dyp and d x dx 1 dxp hence the claim since the exponent of x 1 in the last expression is obviously nonnegative we thus see that f is well defined outside the finite union b of all divisors of x which are mapped to codimension two or more analytic subsets of y by a suitable composition of blow ups u x x and v y y we get f x y holomorphic such that f u v f and moreover such that the strict transform b of b in x has all of its irreducible components mapped onto a divisor of y by f depending on the component of course special varieties and classification theory 77 then g v 1 f f u 1 x 99 ky is holomorphic outside a codimension two or more analytic subset a of x the indeterminacy locus of u 1 but then g oy m ky f injects into px m over x a by hartog s theorem for example this injection extends through a now composing with u p x m p x m we see that f injects oy m ky f into px m as asserted the second assertion is an immediate consequence of the first the first part of this argument in simpler form applies to give proposition 8 24 let u y y be a nice covering in the sense of 4 19 but we choose u such that it ramifies at order exactly mj above each component j of f then 1 u defines an injection of sheaves u oy m ky oy m ky 2 in particular let s h 0 y m ky then u s h 0 y m ky we now come to the crucial point of our modification of the proof of the extension theorem of kobayashi ochiai in a first step we proceed as in section 8 4 by the construction of a pseudo volume form on y with meromorphic not holomorphic degeneracies notation 8 25 let d p 99 kx be such that f d p 99 ky is nondegenerate we need to extend meromorphically to dp since ky is big on y we can write by kodaira s lemma m k h a with a very ample and h effective on y m being choosen sufficiently divisible by the l c m of the mi s and sufficiently big let h h 0 y oy h be an element defining h let h 0 y oy m be a section vanishing exactly on m with the right multiplicities for a the complete linear system defined by h we denote by s h h 0 y m ky let now 0 n a basis of h 0 y a let also sj h j for j j 0 n let further tj sj j these are meromorphic sections of m ky define v j n j 0 i p 2 mtj t j 1 m thus v is a global pseudo volume form with meromorphic degeneracies on y notice however that by proposition 8 23 above f tj is for any j a holomorphic section of p x m this is simply because in local coordinates on y we can write tj tj d dy for some holomorphic function tj where d resp dy is a local generator of the ideal defining m resp ky i thank m paun for this important observation the assertion thus follows from 8 23 and the fact that dy d is a local section of m ky in particular tj is a holomorphic section of mkm with m d p and so w v is naturally a pseudo volume form with holomorphic degeneracies on m for the same reason f sj is for any j a holomorphic section of p x m exactly in the same way we defined w v we can define a pseudo volume form with holomorphic degeneracies w on m by w j n j 0 i p 2 m sj sj 1 m notice that here however there is no pseudo volume form v on y such that w v the crucial point is now 78 fre de ric campana lemma 8 26 ricci w ricci w if y pn is the regular map defined by the complete linear system a on y and the curvature form of the fubini study metric on pn in particular ricci w is thus negative everywhere and there exists c 0 such that kw 1 c everywhere on d p proof write again tj tj d dy as above we deduce that v h d 2 m v vol y if h is a local equation for h and vol y a local volume form on y here v j tj 2 1 m now from 8 23 again we see that vol y d 2 m g 2 vol m for a certain holomorphic function g defined on 1 u for u y the open suset where the said trivialisations and charts are defined recall that i v by 8 4 above a computation of the ricci curvature then gives the first assertion for w the assertion for w is deduced from the fact that w d 2 m w so that these two pseudo volume forms have the same ricci form we then get kw p v p h gm 2 m v volm and so kw d 2 m kw 1 c 1 h 2 m v because v is differentiable and h locally bounded from above everywhere on y to express things differently one can compute the ricci function of w symbolically as if it were of the form v with v j n j 0 i p 2 msj sj 1 m by the argument given in section 8 2 to show 8 2 it is sufficient to show that each of the sj s extend meromorphically to dp and this is true if the integral of w over d p r is convergent for some 0 r 1 to show this convergence we simply need by the ahlfors schwarz lemma to show that w has everywhere negatively bouded ricci function by some constant 1 c 0 but this exactly what the preceding lemma 8 26 claims this concludes the proof of the first assertion of 8 2 remark 8 27 observe that the preceding proof shows with minor adaptations using 8 24 the following orbifold version of theorem 8 2 if y is an orbifold of general type y smooth and suported on a normal crossings divisor then any nondegenerate meromorphic map u 99 k y extends meromorphically to v here to say that is a meromorphic map to the orbifold y means that any point u u at which is holomorphic with y u a smooth point of the support of lying on i then lifts locally around u to a holomorphic map to the ramified cover of y near y ramifying at order exactly mi above i 8 7 extension of pluri canonical meromorphic forms we now want to control the order of the poles along d of the meromorphic extension to v of s h 0 u pu m for s h 0 y m ky more precisely notations being as above proposition 8 28 for any m 0 sufficiently divisible and s any element of h 0 y m ky f s extends to s h 0 v pv m m 1 d proof recall that the support of is of normal crossings we can assume that is holomorphic because the assertion holds for v if it does for any of its blow ups recall that s can be written in local coordinates as follows s being a section of m ky f special varieties and classification theory 79 s d y y 1 1 m 1 1 y 1 1 mp p m if has local equation the denominator of this expression some of the mi may be one and so the corresponding terms don t contribute let now v v 1 vn be local coordinates near a generic point of some component d of d such that d has local equation w v 1 0 we can assume that near this point the map is given by v vr 11 y 1 v rp 1 yp for integers ri and nowhere vanishing functions yi of v computing we get letting r be r 1 rp s wr 1 wr s y m with w v 1 for some holomorphic p form on v and y a nowhere vanishing function on v the product of the yi s and s r 1 m 1 rp mp this shows the proposition because s m is a positive integer since each mi divides m 8 8 proof that h specialness implies log rational connectedness we prove here proposition 8 14 we use the notations and setting of 8 1 8 12 and 8 7 proof we just need to show that any element s of h 0 v p v m m 1 d vanishes provided it is on u of the form s for some s h 0 x px m for this we shall just show that its restriction to any f w p 1 c v has to vanish for any w w the argument is similar to and motivated by the one showing that sections of p x m vanish if x is rationally connected see c 5 let q denote the restriction of q v to f for q 0 and let n be the trivial dual of the normal bundle of f in v from the exact sequence 1 n 1 1 f 1 we get for q 0 1 q n q 1 f q 1 n 1 notice that all these sequences are split we now fix q p 0 and denote respectively by b pn the kernel and a 1 f p 1 n the quotient of the corresponding exact sequence from this same split exact sequence we get now for p m a decreasing split filtration by subbundles 0 wm 1 w 1 w 0 p m with successive quotients w 0 w 1 a m wk wk 1 a m k bk wm b m notice that for k 0 m the bundle a m k bk is isomorphic to of 2 m k tensorised by a trivial vector bundle nk on f we now take local coordinates w t on v near w 0 where w w 1 wn 1 are local coordinates on w and t is a a local coordinate near 0 p 1 the map takes the form w t t 1 t d for holomorphic functions i of w t with d dim x in local coordinates near a x since w 0 a by our h speciality assumption locally if is a p form on x near a then is written dt t for and forms in the dwi s if now is a p form then tp 1 dt tp with the same conditions 80 fre de ric campana we now consider the case when s s for some s h 0 x px m from the preceding remarks we can write s s 0 sk sm where each of the sk is the tensor product of m k terms of the form tp 1 dt and of k terms of the form tp so that for each k sk is actually the piece of degree k of s for the above graduation and so turns out to be a section of the bundle am k bk defined above and vanishing at 0 to order m k p 1 k p m p 1 k now we assumed that s has a pole of order at most m 1 at the point at infinity of f thus sk defines a meromorphic section of of 2 m k nk with nk a trivial bundle this section vanishing at 0 to order m p 1 k at least and having a pole of order m 1 at most at infinity this section thus has to vanish because otherwise the number of poles should be the opposite of the degree but here m 1 m p 1 k 2 m k for any integers m p 0 and 0 k m this concludes the proof of 8 14 9 the core and the kobayashi metric 9 1 the kobayashi pseudo metric we refer to kob for a systematic treatment of the following notions let x be a complex manifold let dx be the kobayashi pseudometric on x which is the largest pseudometric d on x such that h d pd for any holomorphic map h d x where d is the unit disc in c and pd is the poincare metric on d for example it is easy to check using the ahlfors schwarz lemma that dcn 0 and pd dd a fundamental property of d is that holomorphic maps are distance decreasing if h x y is any holomorphic map then h dy dx hence if h c x is holomorphic then dx vanishes on the metric closure of the image of h rational and elliptic curves have thus vanishing d in particular if h c x is holomorphic then dx vanishes on the metric closure h of the image of h thus dx will vanish identically if for example h x or if any two points of x can be connected by such a chain of hi s on the opposite side x is said to be hyperbolic if dx is a metric on x defining its usual coherent or metric topology the unit disc and the curves of genus 2 or more which it covers are hyperbolic a fundamental result of r brody states that a compact complex manifold x is hyperbolic if and only if every holomorphic map h c x is constant the study of projective hyperbolic manifolds is guided by the two nearly converse conjectures of s kobayashi and s lang kobayashi s conjecture states that a hyperbolic projective manifold has ample canonical bundle and is so of general type lang s conjecture states that a manifold x is of general type if and only if it is pseudo hyperbolic in lang s terminology which means that there is a proper algebraic subset s x such that any holomorphic map h c x has image contained in s see la 1 2 for more information also on the relations with arithmetic geometry notice that being pseudo hyperbolic in the above sense is a priori weaker than being hyperbolic modulo s in kobayashi s terminology which means that dx is a metric outside s although it seems plausible that both properties are equivalent special varieties and classification theory 81 9 2 hyperbolically special manifolds our aim here and in section 9 10 below is to give a conjectural description of dx in the general case definition 9 1 x c is said to be h special h for hyperbolically if dx 0 our investigations are guided by conjecture 9 2 conjecture iiih let x c then x is special if and only if it is h special we shall give a motivation for conjecture 9 2 in section 9 4 below in section 9 10 we shall complete conjecture iiih by conjecture ivh which hopefully describes dx for any x c examples 9 3 we list special manifolds known to be h special 1 curves a curve is h special iff special that is either rational or elliptic 2 rationally connected manifolds are h special and special this is obvious more generally proposition 9 4 let f x y be a rationally connected fibration ie so is its generic fibre with y projective then dx f dy in particular x is h special iff so is r x proof clearly there exists a pseudometric d y on y such that dx f d y we need to show that d y dy the inequality d y dy is obvious by the decreasing property of dx under holomorphic maps by the algebraic approximation theorem of d l s it is sufficient to show this when y is a curve but then by g h s f has a section this provides us with the opposite inequality remark 9 5 this is another instance in which it is shown that rationally connected manifolds are in many aspects negligible also in fibrations indeed we already saw that if f x 99 ky is a rationally connected fibration with x projective then x and y have the same core the same fundamental group and the same kobayashi pseudo metric only the arithmetic aspects are still unknown although the function field case is by g h s much better understood notice that by the birational invariance of dx the above result applies if y is moishezon in fact as in 3 28 it should still be true when x c 3 manifolds with trivial canonical class they provide important examples of manifolds with 0 then conjecture iiih is obviously true for complex tori true for k 3 surfaces see below using bogomolov decomposition theorem it is sufficient to test the irreducible holomorphic sym plectic manifolds and the calabi yau manifolds the known symplectic manifolds form a very short list the two series of beauville fujiki and the two examples of o grady for all these examples a direct verification seems quite feasible by reduction to the case of abelian surfaces and k 3 surfaces for others symplectic manifolds if any the method of c 90 obviously underexploited there gives a very positive indication the first significant example of calabi yau manifolds that of quintics in p 4 c might be acces sible also by a strategy explained to me by c voisin 82 fre de ric campana 4 manifolds with 0 this is a crucial case motivated by the special case where kx is trivial the conjecture then implies by 5 1 the vanishing of dx this question is standard and was already raised in kob 76 5 finite e tale covers of an h special x are h special too by the invariance of kobayashi pseudometric under e tale covers 6 h special manifolds let us now consider the opposite implication that h specialness should imply specialness its difficulty lies in the fact that the vanishing of dx has no known geometric translation in dimension 3 or more see 9 16 for a simple discussion of this topic so we start with a stronger hypothesis that gives such an implication definition 9 6 we say that x c is h special if there exists a holomorphic map with dense image in the metric topology u x where u w c with w quasi projective and moreover such that w 0 a for some fixed a x and any w w then x is obviously h and h special if it is h special by 8 12 x is also special in particular of course manifoldsx which are cd dominable or covered by cd areh special they are special too by 8 11 9 3 similarities three stability properties we list here to stress their analogies three stability properties which are common to the classes of special and h special manifolds a let f x y be a fibration and g v x be holomorphic with f g v y surjective then x is special resp h special if so are v and the generic fibres of f b assume x is s connected resp h connected in this case x is special resp h special here being s connected resp h connected means that two generic points of x can be joined by a chain of subvarieties of x which are special resp h special c the albanese map is surjective if x is special resp h special provided its albanese torus is simple see 5 3 resp 9 13 below for the special resp h special case notice that conjecture iiih implies that specialisations of special varieties are special because this specialisation stability holds for h special varieties by the metric continuity of the kobayashi metric 9 4 the origin of conjecture iiih conjecture iiih is motivated by the following question 9 7 let f x y be an admissible fibration assume that df 0 if f is a general fibre of f then dx f d y for a certain pseudometric d y on y a is then d y d y f the kobayashi pseudometric of the orbifold y f defined in 9 23 below b is d y f 0 if either y f 0 or if there exists a family of rational curves ct t t with xt f 1 ct special for t t general and such that any two points of y can be connected by a finite chain of such ct s notice that the above theorem 9 4 shows that the preceding question has a positive answer for rationally connected fibrations f x y if y is projective because then f is empty special varieties and classification theory 83 let us show briefly how to deduce conjecture iiih from a positive answer to the above question assuming moreover conjectures 0 expressing the core as a composition of orbifold iitaka fibrations and rational quotients we keep the notations of 6 4 we argue by induction on the largest number k 0 such that skx x sk x is not the constant map if skx r is the constant map then there exists a family of rational curves ct as in the question b above by the positive answer to that question the orbifold pseudometric on the base vanishes while the fibres have vanishing psudometric by the induction hypothesis hence the conclusion by a if g r skx is not constant then s k 1 x is constant the preceding argument applied to jbg instead of s k x r gives the conclusion the following result due to b l and l can be rephrased as giving a second example abelian fibrations over curves in which the above question 9 7 has a positive answer theorem 9 8 let f x c be a fibration with c a curve x projective and the generic fibres of f being abelian varieties then 9 7 above has a positive answer more precisely dx c x d c where d c vanishes if f is not of general type and otherwise is a metric on c such that g d c dc where g c c is a finite galois cover with c of genus 2 at least the map g having ramification order exactly mi above each of the points ci of f c 9 5 surfaces proposition 9 9 a compact ka hler surface not of general type is h special if and only if it is special and if and only if its fundamental group is virtually abelian thus conjecture iiih holds for them except for potential surfaces of general type and vanishing dx the existence of which is excluded by lang s conjectures for surfaces conjecture iiih is thus equivalent to lang s conjecture proof this follows easily from the results of b l which can be rephrased as saying that non k 3 special surfaces are c 2 dominable and the fact that every k 3 surface is h special by the metric continuity of kobayashi pseudometric used in conjonction with the usual argument of approximating an arbitrary k 3 surface by kummer ones more generally being h special is a property which is closed under deformation in the metric topology thus special surfaces are h special the reverse direction is clear because a non special surface not of general type has by 3 30 a finite e tale cover which maps surjectively onto a curve of genus two or more and cannot thus be h special remark 9 10 let x c be h special with x 0 1 then x is special indeed the case 0 resp 1 follows from 5 1 resp 3 14 9 6 threefolds our results are very partial the complete solution of conjecture iiih in this case depends in particular on the solution of several other difficult conjectures lang s conjecture in dimension 3 its orbifold generalisation as stated in section 9 23 below for orbifold surfaces and finally the case where 0 proposition 9 11 let x be a projective threefold 84 fre de ric campana 1 assume x 6 3 ess x 6 2 and x is h special then x is special 2 assume x 6 0 2 and x is special then x is h special unless possibly in the following case x 1 and jx has generic fibres wich are k 3 surfaces let us remark that the non algebraic case presents some specific difficulties which can however be solved at the cost of some lengthy arguments the case x 2 left open in the above statement seems also accessible by known methods we hope to come back on this in a later work the proof that the special 3 folds listed above are h special does not present any difficulty using the description of special 3 folds given in 3 38 the converse direction rests on the fact that if f x 99 ky is surjective with x h special then y is h special too 9 7 the fundamental group conjectures 7 1 and iiih imply that if x is h special then its fundamental group should be virtually abelian it is thus natural to conjecture independantly that being h special should force the fundamental group to be virtually abelian notice that this would imply for example that beingh special or cd dominable or being covered by cd implies the virtual abelianity of the fundamental group recall that this last implication by far the easiest one is equivalent to s iitaka s conjecture and is widely open a typical example of a question suggested by the preceding context is question 9 12 let f c x x c be a holomorphic map with zariski dense image is then 1 x almost abelian 9 8 the albanese map however in complete analogy with the special case see 5 3 we have using strengthenings of a classical result of bloch ochiai surprisingly it does not seem to have ever been stated that way proposition 9 13 let x c be h special then its albanese map x x alb x is surjective if alb x is a simple torus of course the hypothesis that alb x is simple is artificial it could be removed using another result of y kawamata in kw provided one could positively answer question 9 14 below which is a natural strengthening of brody s theorem alternatively it is possible that a suitable sharpening of the proof of bloch ochiai s theorem permits to remove this artificial hypothesis without answering question 9 14 in general question 9 14 let x be a compact complex connected manifold let z x be a proper compact analytic subset assume that any holomorphic map h c x has image contained in z is then the kobayashi pseudo metric dx a metric on its complement x z notice also that certain recent results of noguchi winkelmann or at least the methods there might imply that in 9 13 the albanese map considered is surjective and has no multiple fibres in codimension one as expected from conjecture iiih and theorem 5 3 corollary 9 15 if x c which is h special and with simple albanese torus then a any torsionfree solvable quotient of 1 x is almost abelian b any linear quotient of 1 x is almost abelian special varieties and classification theory 85 proof the proof is exactly the same as that of 7 10 where x was special just observing that any finite e tale cover of x satisfy the same hypothesis also we need to apply zuo s result z that if 1 x had a non trivial semi simple linear representation then x were generically brody hyperbolic in particular not h special 9 9 geometric variants of h speciality brody s theorem says that the obstruction to the hyperbolicity of a compact x is due to the presence of entire curves in x that is images of nonconstant holomorphic maps h c x it is thus natural to try to express the fact that x is h special by the geometry of entire curves lying on x in this sense being h special appears as a transcendental analogue of rational connectedness unfortunately the analogue of a deformation theory for entire curves does not exist and would certainly present great difficulties so we introduced above the notions of h speciality of h speciality and of cd dominability to try to give some examples in which the vanishing of dx is deduced from the geometry of entire curves remark 9 16 let x c one has the following implications between the different notions of speciality cd dominability implies h speciality which implies both h speciality and h speciality which implies speciality by 8 2 of course there are lots of other geometric variants of h speciality which one can introduce replacing for example the metric topology by the zariski topology and or considering jets see gr and which can be considered as approximations of h speciality one can ask about the relationships between the various notions so defined in particular do the notions relative to metric and zariski topologies always coincide we shall just ask one question of whether some strong reverse implications hold between the various notions introduced in 9 16 question 9 17 assume x is h special is x then also h special this question is motivated by the fact that a positive answer which does not seem unrealistic although far beyond reach if true would imply using 8 2 that h special manifolds are special which is one of the two implications of conjecture iiih it is shown in b l that for surfaces not of general type cd dominability h speciality and h speciality are equivalent this may however be a low dimensional phenomenon similar to the fact that rational connect edness unirationality and rationality coincide for complex surfaces this suggests the following obvious observations concerning rationally connected manifolds remark 9 18 let x be a rationally connected manifold then x is h special if x is unira tional then x is cd dominable this suggests of course also the following again far beyond reach since no rationally connected manifold is known which is not unirational although most of them are suspected not to be question 9 19 let x be a rationally connected manifold if x is cd dominable is x unira tional 86 fre de ric campana the answer is not expected to be necessarily positive it seems quite possible that the class of rationally connected manifolds which are cd dominable is strictly intermediate between the other two ones unirational and rationally connected as the following example may suggest example 9 20 the threefold x constructed in u 11 7 1 p 137 is obviously c 3 dominated and less obviously rationally connected but it is asked by k ueno whether it is unirational or not recall that x is nothing but a smooth model of the quotient of e 3 with e the gauss elliptic curve by the cyclic group of order 4 generated by complex multiplication by i 1 on each factor in the other direction discrepancy between rational connectedness and cd dominability even the c 3 dominability of the general quartic in p 4 is far from obvious if true 9 10 the core and the splitting of the kobayashi metric let x c and let cx x c x y be its core by conjecture iiih its general fibres are h special since special thus dx should vanish on all of them by conjecture iiih and the metric continuity of dx there should thus exist a unique pseudometric dc x d y on y c x such that dx c x d y we give a first version of conjecture 9 21 conjecture ivh the pseudometric d c x is a metric on some zariski nonempty open subset c x of c x remark 9 22 1 assume x is of general type then cx idx and we just recover the usual conjecture of lang in its strong form 2 recall that after conjecture ii c x cx is an orbifold of general type thus conjecture ivh appears as an extension of lang s conjecture to the orbifold case 3 the preceding remark can be made more precise if one introduces as in 9 23 below an orbifold kobayashi pseudometric on any orbifold y one may then ask whether d c x dc x cx then conjecture ivh appears as the orbifold extension of lang s conjecture see conjecture iv h below we hope to come back on this latter we shall now propose an orbifold definition of the kobayashi pseudometric definition 9 23 let x be a complex manifold and 1 1 mi i be a q divisor on x with mi positive integers and i irreducible distinct divisors let d be the unit disc in c and h d x a holomorphic map we say that h is an orbifold map to x if for each z d such that h z belongs to the smooth locus of say to i for some i then for any nonnegative integer j which is not divisible by mi the j th derivative of h at z seen as a tangent vector to x at h z is tangent to i at h z we then define d x as the largest pseudometric on x such that h d x dd for any orbifold map from d to x we call d x the orbifold kobayashi pseudometric of x i thank j p demailly for supporting my impression that such a definition is meaningful and correcting my first attempt remark that by the same arguments as in the classical case this special varieties and classification theory 87 pseudometric enjoys the same properties as when is empty in which case we just recover the usual kobayashi pseudometric on x in particular we have the following obvious refinement of the distance decreasing property of holomorphic maps proposition 9 24 let f x y be a fibration assume that f f then dx f d y f proof for any holomorphic map h d x f h d y is an orbifold map to y f this trivial argument is in fact the motivation for the definition 9 23 given above notice that for the reverse inequality at least when f is a special fibration one would need to approximate arbitrarily closely holomorphic orbifold maps from d to y by liftable to x ones the definition of multiplicities based on inf shows that there is no local on y obstruction for this we can now formulate more precisely conjecture ivh conjecture 9 25 conjecture iv h let cx x c x be the core of x with cx admissible then 1 dx cx d x cx in other terms dx should be nothing but the lift of the orbifold pseudometric of x cx by cx 2 let x be a klt orbifold of general type then its kobayashi pseudometric is a metric outside some proper algebraic subset s x remark that conjecture iv h obviously implies conjecture ivh 10 arithmetic aspects 10 1 fields of definition we consider here the situation in which x is a projective manifold defined over the field k c supposed to be finitely generated over q this can always be achieved proposition 10 1 let f x y be an almost holomorphic fibration then a f is defined over some finite extension k of k b if f is either jx the iitaka fibration or rx the rational quotient or cx the core of x then f is defined over k itself proof i would like f bogomolov for explaining me the proof and indicating me some of the examples below a the family of fibres of f with their reduced structure for the generic one is then an irreducible component of the hilbert scheme hilb x of x let k be the algebraic closure of k then g gal k k acts on the set of irreducible components of hilb x with finite orbits since this action preserves the hilbert polynomial of any component this shows the claim b when f jx the claim is clear since jx is defined by the linear system m kx for some suitable integer m 0 and this system is invariant under the galois action in the same way because of the maximality properties of the general fibres of rx and cx we see that g preserves the component of hilb x parametrising the generic fibres of either rx or cx more precisely the conjugate of a rational curve resp a special variety is still rational 88 fre de ric campana resp special notice that the same argument in fact applies to any fibration enjoying a similar maximality property 10 2 arithmetically special manifolds definition 10 2 the projective manifold x is said to be arithmetically special a special for short if its set x k of k rational points is zariski dense in x for some suitable finite extension k k this notion is usually called potential density in analogy with the notion of h speciality we formulate the conjecture iiia x is special if and only if it is a special in the first version of the present article i hesitated to include this conjecture but the indepen dent kind suggestion from b totaro to include it decided me i thank him for this suggestion one can strengthen the above conjecture by replacing the zariski topology by the metric topology examples in c t s sd show that further field extensions may be needed ie x k may be zariski dense without being metrically dense now guided by lang s arithmetic conjecture that a variety of general type should be mordel lic and the connections he found between hyperbolicity and mordellicity we infer from the observations above in 9 1 the following definitions and conjectures conjecture iva let x be a projective manifold defined over the field k c assumed to be finitely generated over q let cx x c x be its core which is defined over k by the above remark let k k be any finite extension then the k rational points of x are mapped by cx to a proper algebraic subset which is finite outside of the proper algebraic subset s of c x defined in conjecture iv h known cases that special implies a special a curves for genus 0 curves the existence of a k rational point implies already the density of x k for genus 1 curves this is a special case of l n for example b abelian varieties this is shown in l n but is older going back to a weil at least c unirational manifolds the conjecture holds almost by definition for rational surfaces see ct especially th 5 there as well as the references in ct s sd and ct for example the works devoted to this class of surfaces lie much deeper than what is needed for our purpose here because the authors usually work with a fixed base field k d special elliptic surfaces with two sections due to b t the base is a rational or elliptic curve so finitely extending the base field we can assume everything to be defined over k and the two sections having a dense set of k points they induce then using addition in the fibres of the elliptic fibration a dense set of k rational points this is the principle of construction of bo t for a k 3 surface over a number field and a dense set of k rational points by taking a suitable base change by an elliptic double cover of the base p 1 c one can even get a surface x with x 1 and x k dense of course x is special colliot the le ne informed me that k 3 examples with this properties are already in sd and with 1 in cox e quartics in p 4 c these are a special if defined over a number field by h t f fano manifols rationally connected manifolds the answer is not known although the analogous property property is known over function fields see 11 1 below special varieties and classification theory 89 let us list some properties common to special and a special manifolds first in complete analogy with 5 3 and 9 13 theorem 10 3 let x be a special then a the albanese map of x is surjective b any finite e tale cover u x x of x is a special if x is defined over a number field k proof a if not we have a surjective map x z where z is a subvariety of general type of an abelian variety everything is defined over the base field k after a finite extension after fa z k is however not zariski dense this contradicts our assumption that x is a special b this is an immediate consequence of the chevalley weil theorem h s ex c 7 p 292 which states that in this situation x k contains u 1 x k for a suitable finite extension k k the restriction that k is a number field can probably be removed here known cases of conjecture iva the list here is very short a curves this is known by the solution of mordell s conjecture in fa for curves of general type and previous papers by the same author b subvarieties of abelian varieties such a variety is not a special if of general type by fa the distribution of k rational points is as predicted by lang s conjectures c non special surfaces not of general type theorem 10 4 let x be a projective surface defined over the number field k assume x is not special and not of general type then conjecture iva holds for x proof because of the hypothesis either x is birationally ruled over a curve of genus 2 or more and the conclusion follows from fa or x has an elliptic fibration which is of general type in the sense of 1 9 but then x has a finite e tale cover x which is elliptic over a curve of general type the conclusion now follows from combining fa and 10 3 the chevalley weil theorem notice that the preceding argument in fact solves more generally conjecture iva when ess x 1 over number fields proposition 10 5 assume ess x 1 and x is defined over a number field then conjecture iva holds for x the hypothesis here means that the core of x is a fibration of gcd general type not just of general type see 6 8 for this notion it is an interesting question to know if the arguments can be adapted to the case where ess x 1 remark 10 6 1 the preceding result is known in various versions see da da g ct s sd i thank d abramovitch and j l colliot the le ne for learning me these references 2 presumably the conclusion extends if k is finitely generated over q 3 lang s connection between hyperbolicity and arithmetic properties and the reformulation above of conjecture ivh as conjecture iv h also suggest strongly that one should be able to attach to any projective orbifold y defined over k the notion of its k rational points y k 90 fre de ric campana such a definition can actually be given quite naturally in complete analogy with the hyperbolicity and function field cases considered here as explained to me by e peyre pey an important property is that if f x y is a fibration defined over k then f x k y f k the latter being the set of k rational points of the base orbifold y f of f then conjecture iva above can be reformulated as the assertion that an orbifold of general type defined over k does not have a zariski dense set of k rational points conjecture iv a let cx x c x be an admissible representative of the core of x defined over k finitely generated over q ifk k is any finite extension s c x is defined as in conjecture iv h then c x cx k has only finitely many points outside of s and contains cx x k 10 3 a related conjecture of abramovitch and colliot thelene a conjecture related to conjecture iiia is formulated in h t and attributed to d abramovitch and j l colliot the le ne i thank j l colliot the le ne for learning me this reference it claims that if x is what we called w special and defined over a number field then x is a special potentially dense there and conversely this conjecture thus coincides with conjecture iiia if the properties of being special and w special coincide although no example of a w special but not special manifold is known today it seems plausible that the two properties are distinct special is anyway more restrictive the difference in the two conjectures is that if there exists an x defined over a number field which is w special but not special it should be a special by h t but not by iva which would imply that its k rational points should lie in finitely many fibres of cx outside of c 1 x s 11 the function field case 11 1 the complex function field case the following extremely interesting function field variant of conjectures iiia and iva above was suggested to me by p eyssidieux they are included here with his kind authorisation one could of course consider other fields than c as well we need first some conventions conventions let f x c be a fibration onto a complex projective curve c with x complex projective smooth connected let s 0 f chow x be the zariski open subset consisting of holomorphic sections of f and let s f be its closure in chow x the chow variety of x we also denote by s 0 x x the union of all images of sections of f and by s x the zariski closure of s 0 x in x we say that an irreducible component of s 0 f is x covering if the union of all images of sections in is zariski dense in x and so covers a nonempty zariski open subset of x let finally b c c be any finite covering possibly ramified with c a smooth connected projective curve we then let f x c be deduced from f by the base change b we define also s f s x as before with f in place of f the arithmetic interpretation is that if k is the non algebraically closed function field of c ie its field of meromorphic functions then x is a model of the k variety xk defined over k by special varieties and classification theory 91 the function field of x moreover the sections of f are exactly the k rational points x k of xk and x k is zariski dense in xk if and only if so is s 0 x or equivalently s x x the finite extensions k k are exactly the ones given by the coverings b c c above we shall say that f x c is split if there exists a manifold f and a birational map f c x over c after some suitable base change b this is essentially lang s terminology in la 2 we need to introduce the orbifold version of the preceding notions an orbifold x over c will be just a fibration f x c as above together with an orbifold structure on x the notions of kodaira dimension canonical bundle general type are defined by restriction to the general fibre if f x c and g y c are fibrations a fibration h x 99 ky over c is the usual h such that g h f when h is holomorphic we can naturally define its base orbifold an orbifold structure on y in the expected way this leads to the notion of kodaira dimension of h denoted y f c a special fibration f x c is thus defined in the same way as we already did by the existence of a relative core this is the same as having a special general fibre in this context it is maybe useful to define the sections of an orbifold x over c these are simply the sections of f which meet each component j of at order at least mj at each point where the section meets j if j j 1 1 mj j we say that x is split if it becomes birationally trivial after some base change b as in the non orbifold version birationally trivial means that x is birational to f d c over c for some constant orbifold f d definition 11 1 we say that the k variety xk is special resp rationally connected resp an abelian variety resp of general type if so is the general fibre of f let f g h be factorisation of f by fibrations h x y and g y c we say that this factorisation is the k core resp the k rational quotient resp the k albanese map if it induces the corresponding reduction on the general fibre of f these factorisations thus exist by 12 27 and analogous results for the other cases are uniquely defined and moreover compatible with the base changes b because of the split case the formulation of the function field version of conjectures iiia and iva is not exactly the same to formulate them we need to introduce the k core f gf cf of f see 12 27 we thus have a factorisation of f by cf x c f and gf c f c conjecture 11 2 conjecture iiiff the k rational points of xk are zariski dense in x for some finite extension k k if and only if gf c f c f c is split in particular if xk is special x k is zariski dense in x for a suitable finite extension k k one might say in analogy with the terminology introduced in 9 1 and 10 2 that they are ff special ff standing for function field geometrically this just means that s x x if and only if c f is birationally a product over c after a preliminary covering of c maybe 92 fre de ric campana conjecture 11 3 conjecture ivff assume that gf c f c f c is not split there exists a zariski closed subset t c f t 6 c f such that for any finite extension k k cf s x is contained in t and a finite union of images of sections of gf remark 11 4 if gf is split one can consider also only the sections which are not constant to then recover exactly the same formulations as in the arithmetic case known cases when xk is special one wants to know if x k becomes zariski dense for a suitable finite extension k k a curves for rational curves this is clear because such surfaces x are birationally ruled for elliptic fibrations it is a special case of the next case alternatively by a suitable base change construct 2 sections the first one is used as the zero section to define a relative group law then choose the second section so as to have infinite order this is an immediate construction b abelian varieties this is shown in a more general form in l n c rationally connected varieties they are ff special for function field special this immediately follows from the glueing lemma of ko mi mo which implies that if the generic fibre of f x c is rationally connected and if f has a section then any finite set of x mapped injectively to c is contained in a section of f notice that g h s announces that f itself has a section so that no field extension is needed in that case d surfaces the answer is known except for k 3 surfaces as fibres theorem 11 5 let f x c be a fibration with its generic fibre a special but not k 3 surface then s x x for a suitable finite covering b c c the proof will be given elsewhere the case of elliptic k 3 surfaces is true and immediate it is certainly worth investigating the case of general k 3 s known cases when xk is not special the list is then much more limited it is in fact restricted to cases when xk is of general type and where conjecture ivff reduces to the function field case of lang s conjectures a curves this case has been settled by various approaches by h grauert gr y manin man and a n parshin par b subvarieties of general type of abelian varieties this the case where the general fibre f of f is of general type and mapped birationally into its albanese variety by its albanese map we now turn to another question quite natural in our context but for which we don t know any reference 11 2 split and dominated fibrations the rational quotient we shall make here some easy observations on the non orbifold versions it would be interesting to extend them to the orbifold case as well definition 11 6 the fibration f x c is said to be dominated if there exists a projective manifold f and a dominant rational map g f c x ovec c for some suitable b c c if the above map g can be chosen to be regular resp isomorphic above the generic point of c we say that f is regularly dominated resp isotrivial special varieties and classification theory 93 remark that if f is dominated the manifold f can be chosen to be of the same dimension as f the generic fibre of f so that g is generically finite and remark also that a split fibration is dominated our objective now is to introduce conjecture iiisd below which says that the obstruction to reverse implication lies in the rational quotient of f the relevance of notion of dominatedness to our context is the following proposition 11 7 the following properties are equivalent for a fibration f x c a f is dominated b s 0 x x for a suitable b c c see above for the definition of s 0 x c there exists an irreducible component t of s f which is x covering for some suitable b c c see 12 proof obviously a implies b to show that b implies c use the countability at infinity of the chow scheme of x to show that c implies a take t f and use the surjective evaluation map of the incidence graph g say of the algebraic family of cycles parametrised by t the conclusion is implied by the fact that g is bimeromorphic to c t because the generic point of t parametrises a section of f conjecture 11 8 conjecture iiisd i let rk x r xk be the rational quotient of the fibration f x c then xk is dominated if and only if r xk is split a weaker form shown below to be equivalent is ii assume xk is dominated but not split then xk is uniruled ie so is f this means in particular that xk is dominated if rationally connected and that it is split if it is dominated and not uniruled we shall show several cases where the above conjecture holds first the if part theorem 11 9 if r xk is split then xk is dominated a special case when r xk c is corollary 11 10 assume xk is rationally connected then it is dominated it would be interesting to have concrete examples when f is a three dimensional cubic or quartic for example the above result asserts that one can uniformely dominate one dimensional families of such manifolds although they are birationally distinct proof of 11 9 assume r x c r after finite base change if needed let r r be generic and let r k xr r 1 k c r c r be the restriction of rk to xr this is a rationally conected fibration and so by g h s and ko mi mo it is dominated thus so is f using characterisation b above of dominatedness theorem 11 11 if the weaker form ii of conjecture iiisd holds the stronger form i also holds proof the proof is actually a direct application of 3 20 or of g h s which asserts the equiva lence of rational connectedness and rational generatedness this last notion is defined as follows 94 fre de ric campana x is rationally generated if for any fibration h x y y is uniruled indeed since xk is dominated so is r xk if r xk is not split it is uniruled by but g h s for details in particular says that r xk is not uniruled if conversely r xk is split we deduce from 11 9 above that xk is dominated we now give some positive answers to the conjecture iiisd ii proposition 11 12 assume that through the generic point of x there exists a positive dimensional family of sections of f x c then xk is uniruled this is a simple application of mori s bend and break technique indeed proof this is a simple application of mori s bend and break technique indeed let x x be generic with a positive dimensional family of sections through it by mori s techniques no characteristic p 0 is needed here there is a rational curve in x through x if the base c is not rational is vertical ie contained in the fibre of f through x we can reduce to this case by a base change b c c with c non rational because sections of f lift to sections of f so the remaining case is when x is dominated but the set of sections through the general point of any x is at most countable not empty proposition 11 13 assume xk is regularly dominated then xk is isotrivial this is essentially up to the terminology shown in mw corollary 11 14 assume f the generic fibre of f is an absolutely minimal model in the sense that any birational rational map r f 0 f with f 0 smooth is regular then xk is isotrivial if dominated example 11 15 the above condition is satisfied if f is an abelian variety or a minimal surface with f 0 another important case is given by proposition 11 16 assume f is of general type if xk is dominated it is split this is shown in mae observe that conjecture iiisd ii consists in extending this to the case where f is not uniruled already the conjecturally equivalent case where f 0 would be of interest 12 appendix geometric quotients we now turn to the exposition of various techniques of construction of quotients for equivalence relations of geometric origin these techniques have been introduced in c 80 81 and have found many subsequent applications c 92 ko mi mo c 94 c 01 among others they are based on fundamental properness properties of the chow scheme c x of x see ba if x is not projective if x c discovered in lieb see fu for the hilbert douady space case further properties having been shown in c 80 when x is projective these properties reduce to the well known projectivity of the irreducible components of c x of x special varieties and classification theory 95 the cycle of x naturally parametrised by t t is denoted by vt conversely if v is a subvariety of x ie irreducible reduced we denote by v or sometimes simply v the the correspopnding point t c x we need some preliminary definitions and facts 12 1 covering families let x be a compact connected normal analytic space not necessarily in c we shall consider finite or countable unions t c x of compact irreducible subvarieties ti c x such that a vvt is irreducible for t generic in t b x is the union of all vt s for t t equivalently if v x t is the incidence graph of the family vt t t and q v t and p v x the restrictions to v of the projections then p is surjective and for any index i qi has generic fibres which are irreducible where vi qi and pi denote the incidence graph of the family ti and the restrictions of p and q to vi respectively we say then that t c x is a covering family of x notice that by baire s category theo rem at least one of the families ti c x has to be a covering family of x because the maps qi are equidimensional we have the following important proposition 12 1 if t is a covering family of x then a vt is connected for every t t b vi is irreducible for every i more generally c if v i is deduced from qi vi ti by any surjective base change by t i ti with t i irreducible then v i is irreducible too sometimes we shall denote by v not the incidence graph of the family t but its normalisation or a smooth model of it without further notice remark 12 2 all results in this appendix hold together with their proofs without any change if x is arbitrary irreducible not necessarily compact provided the maps qi pi are all assumed to be proper so the ti s are not necessarily compact either this was observed and used in c 94 14 2 t equivalence see also c 81 let t c x be a covering family of x let r t be the equivalence relation on x which is generated by the symmetric reflexive binary relation r 1 t on x for which x x x are related if and only if there exists t t such that vt contains x and x thus x x x are r t equivalent iff they can be joined by ie are contained in a t chain this is by definition a connected union of finitely many of the vt s we say that x is t connected if r t has a single equivalence class ie any two points of x can be connected by some t chain for these definitions we do not assume that t is irreducible we only assume that each irreducible component of t is compact and that t has at most countably many such components observe that r 1 t x x has the following description r 1 t p p v t v with obvious notations from this and 12 1 we conclude 96 fre de ric campana corollary 12 3 if t is a covering family of x then for any i r 1 ti is irreducible the fundamental result on t equivalence is now the following theorem 12 4 c 81 let t c x be a covering family of x assume that x is normal there exists a fibration qt x xt such that its general fibre is an equivalence class for r t of course this map is unique up to equivalence moreover qt is almost holomorphic the map qt is called the t quotient of x remark 12 5 if t has only finitely many irreducible components the word general can be replaced by generic in 12 4 see below it is not necessary to assume that x c in 12 4 remark 12 6 the above result is shown in c 6 only when t is irreducible the general case stated here can however be easily reduced to this special case by arguments sketched below in 12 3 see also c 94 for a more general version but the proof goes through in which x is not assumed to be compact but pi is assumed to be only proper this version is used to construct reductions also called shafarevitch maps these t quotients appear in many other problems finally the normality assumption is essential as shown by examples given in c 81 theorem 12 4 is exposed in ko 1 in the algebraic context via an approch slightly different from and no appropriate quotation of the original one a carefull corrected exposition along this line is given in de the proof of thorem 12 4 will be done in two steps first the proof of the case where t has finitely many components each covering second the the easy reduction to this special case 12 2 construction of the quotient for an irreducible covering family we shall prove here theorem 12 4 when t is irreducible the proof is exactly the same as in c 81 except for a slight simplification at one point which shortens the exposition this simplification consists in replacing t by t in step 2 below let us remark that the proof works also if t is not necessarily irreducible provided all components ti of t are covering we thus start with a diagram v p q x t in which v t x are irreducible compact p q surjective and q is equidimensional with generic fibre irreducible also x is normal because t is fixed we delete t from the notations introduced in 12 1 obtaining r r 1 instead of r t r 1 t we define an n chain of t as the connected union of n of the vt s we say that x x x are n equivalent for t if they are connected by ie contained in some n chain of t special varieties and classification theory 97 we denote by rn or rn t the symetric set of x x consisting of pairs x x x which are n equivalent when n 0 resp n we define rn as being x the diagonal of x resp r n 0 rn the sequence rn is of course increasing for the inclusion lemma 12 7 for any n 1 one has 1 rn 1 p q 1 p 1 rn where p and q v t v x x denote the restrictions to v t v of p p v v x x and q q respectively 2 rn x x is zariski closed 3 r 1 is irreducible see 12 1 proof easy see c 81 for details definition 12 8 we shall now say that an irreducible component of rn is significant if it contains x we note rn rn the union of the significant irreducible components of rn thus rn x x is zariski closed and rn has only finitely many significant components for any n notice that r 1 r 1 is irreducible if t is we also note dn t dn dim rn for every n 0 this is an increasing bounded sequence of integers so it stabilises at some n 0 definition 12 9 we shall say that the irreducible covering family t of x is stationary if a p is a modification b d 2 d 1 theorem 12 4 is proved in two steps corresponding to the following two propositions proposition 12 10 let t be an irreducible covering family of x normal there exists a stationary irreducible covering family t of x such that r t r t propsition 12 11 will be proved below proposition 12 11 let t be an irreducible stationary covering family of x normal then a h q p 1 x 99 kt is an almost holomorphic fibration b h x 99 kt is the t quotient of x proof of 12 11 the second assertion is an immediate consequence of the first because h is then holomorphic near each of its regular fibres the ones not meeting the indeterminacy locus ih of h so that each such fibre is then an equivalence class for r t r everything is clear from the definitions and assumptions in the first assertion except for the fact that h is almost holomorphic we check this by contradiction assuming that each fibre f vt of h meets ih this implies that f also meets j the indeterminacy locus of p 1 let x j f because x is normal p 1 x w is positive dimensional at each of its points in particular at x t x let w be an irreducible component of w containing x let s p q 1 q w x and let y f vt be generic then s y r 2 t because x y and s x are in r 1 t if s s by construction more precisely if f vt is irreducible reduced then s y r 2 t because s is then irreducible and t t generic 98 fre de ric campana we now get that d 2 d m if d dim s and m dim x while d 1 f m if f dim f dim v m to get a contradiction it is thus sufficient to show that d f but this is obvious because dim s dim p q q 1 w dim q q 1 w dim w f f the second equality comes from the fact that p is a modification and that f is not contained in j but is contained in q q 1 w we now start the proof of 12 10 we shall denote for any a x x by r resp r the restriction to a of the first resp second projection of x x to x and by a x resp a x the fibre of r resp r above x x let s x x x x be the involution exchanging the factors we say that a is symmetric if s a a in this case a x a x x x and is simply denoted a x the main step in the proof of 12 10 is lemma 12 12 let n 0 be such that dn d 2 n then a rn is symmetric and irreducible b rn x is irreducible and locally irreducible at x x for x generic in x before we show 12 12 let us prove that it implies proposition 12 10 let r rn x be the first projection by 12 12 it is a fibration let g x 99 kc x be the associated map sending x x generic to rn x let t c x be the image of g this is an irreducible covering family of x it thus only remains to observe the following two properties a r t r t b the family t is stationary let us show a for x generic in x rn x r 1 x by definition with r r t because r 1 is irreducible by 12 1 we conclude that r 1 t rn t r t thus r t r t in the opposite direction because r 1 t is irreducible and contains the diagonal r 1 t rn t r 1 t thus r t r t observe this argument still works if t consists of finitely or infinitely many components ti each of which is covering so that r 1 ti contains the diagonal but it does not work in general let us next show b because r 1 t rn t we have r 2 t r 2 n t thus also r 2 t r 2 n t so d 2 t d 2 n dn d 1 t hence b to conclude the proof of theorem 12 4 it thus only remains to give the proof of lemma 12 12 we first prove by contradiction that rn x is irreducible at x x for x x generic otherwise rn had two distinct local irreducible components s 1 s 2 at x x with s 1 say of dimension dn and s 1 x s 2 x are irreducible at x x for x close to x by lemma 12 13 below applied to each local irreducible component of rn we have a natural holomorphic map h w s 1 x x s s 2 r 2 n x defined by sending x y y z to x z shrinking suitably the domain w of this map we can assume that it is irreducible because the generic fibres of w over x are irreducible but now h w contains special varieties and classification theory 99 s 1 x u take z x and s 2 x u take y x if u is a sufficiently small open neighborhood of x in x because s 2 x is not contained in s 1 x by hypothesis the rank of h at the generic point of w is thus strictly larger than dim s 1 m dn m if m dim x because this rank is at most d 2 n m this implies that d 2 n dn contradicting our assumptions the others assertions of 12 12 are immediate consequences of lemma 12 13 below to complete the proof of theorem 12 4 for t irreducible it thus simply remain to show the lemma 12 13 let g v w be a surjective holomorphic map between complex spaces with w v a holomorphic section let w w if v is lacally irreducible at the generic point of w then for w w generic a the g fibre vw over w is locally irreducible at w w b vw is irreducible if g is proper proof we shall give by lack of suitable reference a proof based on desingularisation the only advantage is its shortness elementary algebro geometric proofs were longer see c 81 for an analytic proof proof of a let d v v be a smooth model of v and g g d v w we can assume w to be smooth connected the fibres of d over w are thus connected by assumption and zariski s main theorem let w d 1 w v the rank of g is then maximal equal to m dim w at each w w w wherew is zariski open and contains w g 1 u where u is a dense zariski open subset of w this holds true by standard zariski lower semi continuity properties of the rank and bertini theorem for w w generic we conclude that the fibre v w of g over w is connected and smooth near ww thus vw d v w is irreducible near w hence a proof of b let v w be a smooth generic fibre of g we saw that ww d 1 w is connected it is thus contained in a unique connected component w of v w let g h g be the stein fac torisation of g with g v w connected and h w w finite now the previous observation defines a natural meromorphic section h of h which sends w w generic to w this shows b the above proof of theorem 12 4 easily gives an estimate of the length of the t chains connecting two general t equivalent points of x see ko mi mo and de for similar results proposition 12 14 let t be an irreducible covering family of x normal let qt x xt be the t quotient of x and f a regular ie contained in the regular locus of qt fibre of qt then any two points of f are joined by a t chain of length at most l 2 f r where r dim vt and f dim x dim xt is the dimension of a generic fibre of qt in particular l 2 f 1 unless t is the family of points of x actually the statement holds for any chow theoretic fibre f of qt as the proof shows proof assume the sequence d 1 d 2 d 4 d 2 k is strictly increasing while d 2 k d 2 k 1 thus d 2 k d 1 k from the proof of 12 4 we see that d 1 m r while d 2 k m f if m dim x thus m f d 2 k d 1 k m r k and k f r hence the claim since by construction two points of f are connected by a t chain of length 2 k 100 fre de ric campana remark 12 15 the proofs given here work also when t has all of its components ti covering if r denotes the infimum of the corresponding ri s so in this case we always get l 2 f 1 the estimate is then in this case slightly sharper than the one l 2 f 1 given in loc cit the estimate l 2 f 1 can easily be deduced but apparently not improved see section 12 3 below in the general case from 12 14 and the reduction process described in the next section 12 3 reduction to the case where t is irreducible we show how to reduce the proof of theorem 12 4 to the case where t is irreducible we shall consider the set f x t of almost holomorphic fibrations f x 99 ky which are sub ordinate to t this means by definition that r f r y r t here y is seen as the covering family parametrised by the family of fibres of f notice that the identity map of x is in f x t let t ti be a component of t and v p q the data associated to t as in 12 1 let f f x t we say that ti is f covering if f p v y is surjective the main step of the reduction process is contained in lemma 12 16 assume that t is f covering for some f subordinate to t then either 1 r t r f or 2 there exists a fibration g y 99 ky with dim y dim y and such that f g f x 99 ky is almost holomorphic and subordinate to t moreover r t r f before proving 12 16 we show how it implies the existence of qt in the general case take f x 99 ky be in f x t and such that dim y is minimum let j be the set of i s such that ti is not f covering let t be the union of all components ti of t which are f covering from the preceding lemma we see that r ti r f for each i j for a general fibre f of f we thus see that f is saturated for r t and moreover that r t r t on this fibre because the ti s are not f covering if i j thus f is saturated for r t finally because f is subordinate to t we see that f is a single r t eaquivalence class proof of 12 16 let thus t be f covering and assume that r t is not contained in r f so dim vt 0 if t is generic in t in this case define for t t generic the new reduced cycle v t x by v t f 1 f vt this cycle is irreducible because so are vt and the generic fibre of f let now t c x be the closure in c x of the points parametrising the cycles v t so obtained it is obvious to check that t is an irreducible covering family of x and that we have a natural factorisation map g y y xt such that f g f if f x y is the t quotient of x obviously dim y dim y because dim vt 0 if t is generic in t moreover we have an inclusion r 1 t r 1 t because r t is generated by r f and r t this inclusion extends to r t r t so that f is subordinate to t as claimed let us show that r t is generated by r f and r t the inclusions of r 1 f and r 1 t in r 1 t are obvious by construction so that r f and r t are contained in r f the reverse direction is immediately given by the lemma 12 17 1 r 1 t is the main component of f f 1 f f r 1 t special varieties and classification theory 101 2 r 1 t r 2 s if s is the covering family with the two irreducible components y and t proof the first assertion follows immediately from the definition of the generic v t and the fact that r 1 t is irreducible while the second follows from the first and lemma 12 7 remark 12 18 de ko mi mo any two points of any chow theoretic fibre f of q x 99 kxt can be connected by a t chain of length at most l 2 b 1 if b dim x dim xt is the dimension of f proof by the reduction process just described above and using the same notations we just need to show that if this holds for f in place of qt this holds also for f so that r f is generated by r f and r t t an irreducible f covering family of x by 12 14 to points of any fibre chow theoretic as always f of f are connected by a t chain of length l 2 b r 2 b b 1 where b dim f r dim v t b 1 with b dim f f any fibre of f by the definition of v t we immediately see that any two of its points are connected by a t chain of length at most 2 l 1 if two points of any fibre of can be connected by a t chain of length l by the hypothesis on f we can take l 2 b 1 so that any two points of any fibre of f can be connected by a t chain of length at most l l 2 l 1 2 b b 1 2 2 b 1 1 2 b 1 as claimed 12 4 zariski regularity definition 12 19 let a s where s is a complex space we say that a is z regular in s if for each irreducible zariski closed subset t of s a t either contains the general point of t or is contained in a countable union of zariski closed proper subsets of t in which case we say that a is of first zariski category in t there are many examples of this situation actually it rather seems that counterexamples are unnatural in algebraic or analytic geometry theorem 12 20 let x c let ap x ap c x be the set of points t parametrising the set of irreducible reduced subvarieties vt of x possessing a certain property p by convention points of x are always supposed to posses p then ap x ap is z regular in c x if p is any one of the following properties 1 vt is special 2 vt is a possibly singular rational curve 3 vt has algebraic dimension at least d a given nonegative integer 4 1 v t x g where g is a class of isomorphism classes of groups and the first term is the image in 1 x of the fundamental group of the normalisation of vt proof for 1 resp 3 4 see corollary 2 37 and proposition 12 21 below resp c 80 c 01 assertion 2 is easy proposition 12 21 let p be a property such that if f x y is any fibration such that x c then the set of irreducible fibres of f having p either contains the general point of y or is of first zariski category in y 102 fre de ric campana then for any x c ap x is z regular proof let t c x be irreducible zariski closed let v vt be the incidence graph of the family t with projections p v x and q v t by c 80 v c thus ap x t either contains the general point of t or is of first zariski category in t by the hypothesis made on p proposition 12 22 let a s be z regular there exists a countable or finite family of zariski closed irreducible subsets si of s such that 1 for each i ai a si contains the general point of si 2 a is the union of the ai s the family si is moreover unique if it is irredundant that is if there is no inclusion among the si s the si s are called the components of a proof let a be the zariski closure of a in s and let a be an irreducible component of a consider a a either it contains the general point of a or it is contained in a countable union b of zariski closed subsets of a in the first case a is a component of a proceed the a after removing its component a in the second case remove a from a and replace it by b repeat this process observing that for each component of a we let at each step decrease the diension of the remaining components so the process ends in finitely many steps for each such component the uniqueness statement is easy to check assume we have two irredundant families si and s j of components of a it is sufficient to show that any si is contained in some s j if not a si is contained in the countable union of the a s j it is then of first zariski category in si this is a contradiction to the definition of a component of a the notion of z regularity has application to the consruction of meromorphic quotients theorem 12 23 let x c be normal let a c x be z regular let t t a be the family of components of a as defined in 12 22 if t is not covering we add the family of points of x let qa x 99 kxt a xa be the t quotient of x let t a such that vt meets some general fibre f of qt then vt is contained in f we shall call also qt the a reduction of x proof by the defining property of qt its general fibre f is an equivalence class for r t a in particular any vt t a is either disjoint from or contained in f remark 12 24 two points in such a fibre are joined by a t a chain such a t a chain turns out to be an a chain if a is stable under specialisation in the sense defined just below so it is important to know if the property p defining a is stable under specialisation ie if each component of vt has the property p when t si if si is a component of ap and ap is z regular for example this is easily seen to be the case for properties 2 3 in 12 20 above the case of 1 is not presently known but a positive answer to the following question is expected question 12 25 let f x y be a special fibration with x c is each irreducible component of xy special for each y y special varieties and classification theory 103 an application of 12 23 above obtained explicitely in c 92 and in ko mi mo in the algebraic case is theorem 12 26 let x c be normal there exists an almost holomorphic map rx x r x called the rational quotient of x such that 1 the fibres of rx are rationally connected ie any two of their points are contained in a connected union od finitely many rational curves 2 if a rational curve c inside x meets some general fibre f of rx then c is contained in f moreover a reductions can be constructed in a relative situation as well theorem 12 27 let x c be normal let f x y be a holomorphic fibration let a c x be z regular let af a be the set of t a such that vt is contained in some fibre of f then af c x is also z regular if qaf x 99 kxaf is the af reduction of x there exists a factorisation haf xaf 99 ky such that f haf qaf moreover for y y general the restriction of qaf to xy is the ay reduction of xy if ay af c xy the map qaf is called the a reduction of f proof the fact that af is z regular is obvious because a is z regular and af is the intersection of a with its zariski closed subset c x y consisting of t s such that vt is contained in some fibre of f we thus have a quotient qaf for af the natural map f c x y y now defines the factoristaion haf because the equivalence classes for t af are obviously contained in fibres of f if one prefers r f contains obviously r t af we shall now show that for y general in y t af y t ay this will immediately imply that xy ay xy af y and so the claim notice first that by definition ay af y for any y next if t af is the union of all components of t af surjectively mapped to y by f then t af y t af y for y general in y it is thus sufficient to show that t af y t ay for y general in y this we now show first we have for y general ay af y t af y this gives the first inclusion t ay t af y to show the reverse let t be a component of t af then ty t ay for general y indeed t af t is contained in a countable union of zariski closed proper subsets bj of t for each j the set cj of y y such that bj ty has empty interior in ty is zariski closed proper in y if c is the union of the cj s and y is not in c we conclude that t af y t ay as claimed the main applications of 12 27 are to construct relative versions of the rational quotient of the core and other natural fibrations for example applying 12 27 to the family of rational curves on x c we get proposition 12 28 let f x y be a fibration x c then f has a rational quotient that is a factorisation f rf rf where rf x r f is a fibration which induces the rational quotient rxy xy r xy r f y for y general in y 104 fre de ric campana 12 5 stability definition 12 29 let a c x be z regular for x c we say that a is stable if it has the following two properties stab 1 the general fibre of qt x xt is in a if t is any covering irreducible component of a in the sense of definition 12 22 above stab 2 t a if vt v x is a subvariety and f v 99 kw is a fibration with general fibre vw in a such that a subvariety w v exists with w a and f w w by abuse of language we say that a suvariety z of x is in a if the point z c x which parametrises this subvariety is in a let us give some examples theorem 12 30 let ap x c x be z regular for x c be as in theorem 12 20 above then ap is stable in the following two cases 1 p is the property of being special if x is smooth 2 ap is the set of t s such that 1 v t x g where g is a class of isomorphism classes of groups which is stable in the sense of c 98 such classes are the class of finite or solvable groups for example the proof is given in section 3 for 1 and in c 98 for 2 the basic result about stability is the following theorem 12 31 let a c x be z regular and stable for x c normal let qa x 99 kxa be the t a quotient of x then 1 the general fibre of qa is in a 2 the general fibre f of qa contains v if v is a subvariety of x which is in a and meets f proof the second property is just one of the defining properties of qa to show the first one we observe that because of stab 1 it is obviously satisfied for the quotient of x by any of the covering irreducible components of t a an so for the first step of the construction of qa as exposed in section 12 3 we now go to the induction step the general fibre of qn 1 is in a if qn has this same property we use here this same section 12 3 to which we refer with the same notations and t t a then the subvarieties v t constructed there from the varieties vt are also in a by stab 2 applied to q and vt a by the hypothesis tn 1 t a using the induction hypothesis the general fibre of q is in a and so by stab 1 again we see that the general fibre of qn 1 is indeed in a re fe rences ab 97 d abramovich langs map
