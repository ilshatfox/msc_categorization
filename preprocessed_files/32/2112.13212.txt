abstract in this paper we explore the existence of pluricomplex green func tions for stein manifolds from a functional analysis point of view for a stein manifold m we will denote by o m the fre chet space of analytic functions on m equipped with the topology of uniform convergence on compact sub sets in the first section we examine the relationship between existence of pluricomplex green functions and the diametral dimension of o m this led us to consider negative plurisubharmonic functions on m with a nontrivial relatively compact sublevel set semi proper in section 2 we characterize stein manifolds possessing a semi proper negative plurisubharmonic function through a local controlled approximation type condition which can be con sidered as a local version of the linear topological invariant of d vogt in section 3 we look into pluri greenian and locally uniformly pluri greenian complex manifolds introduced by e poletsky we show that a complex mani fold is locally uniformly pluri greenian if and only if it is pluri greenian and give a characterization of locally uniformly pluri greenian stein manifolds in terms of the notions introduced in section 2 introduction spaces of analytic functions equipped with the topology of uniform convergence on compact subsets forms an important class of nuclear fre chet spaces in recent years there has been significant advances in the structure theory of nuclear fre chet spaces 14 in order to make use this theory in complex analysis it is imperative to analyze the complex analytic properties shared by stein manifolds whose analytic function spaces possess a common linear topological invariant in this note we look into the connection between the existence of pluricomplex green functions and certain linear topological properties of the fre chet space of analytic functions on a stein manifold a topic that was touched upon in 4 throughout the note we will denote the space of analytic functions on a stein manifold m with compact open topology by o m after compiling some background material in section 1 we recall a result of 4 that relates the existence of pluricomplex green functions on m to the diametral dimension of o m and look at an example in section 2 we examine semi proper pluricomplex green functions see defini ton below and give a characterization of their existence in terms of a

aytuna we then relate the existence of semi proper pluricomplex green functions to the linear topological properties of vogt 22 and the diametral dimension for o m in section 3 we look into pluri greenian and locally uniformly pluri greenian complex manifolds introduced by e poletsky 18 19 we show that a complex manifold is locally uniformly pluri greenian if and only if it is pluri greenian and give a characterization of locally uniformly pluri greenian stein manifolds in terms of the notions introduced in section 2 in the last section we recall some research done for the existence of pluricomplex green functions with the intention of putting our results in perspective the manifolds considered in this note are always assumed to be connected we will use the standard terminology and results from functional analysis and complex potential theory as presented in 14 13 respectively 1 pluricomplex green functions on a stein manifold m and the diametral dimension of o m we start by defining the terms appearing in the heading let x be a fre chet space and k k an increasing system of semi norms generating the topology of x let uk x x x k 1 denote the unit ball of the corresponding local banach spaces xk k 1 2 for a subspace l of x and for k k let uk uk l inf t 0 uk tuk l the n th kolmogorov diameter of uk with respect to uk is defined as dn uk uk inf uk uk l l subspace of x of dimension at most n n z there is a huge literature on techniques of computing kolmogorov diameters for specific banach spaces see 16 the diametral dimension of x is defined as x tn n cn k k k tndn uk uk 0 the diametral dimension of x does not depend upon the generating semi norm system and is a linear topological invariant of the fre chet space x in the sense that if x is linear topologically isomorphic to a fre chet space y then x y in the case of nuclear fre chet spaces one can choose a generating system of hilbertian semi norms k k for x and represent the compact linking maps ik k xk xk as ikk n n fn k en where fn and en are orthonormal sequences in xk and xk respectively and n is a sequence of nonnegative numbers converging to 0 in this framework the sequence of kolmogorov diameters dn uk uk coin cides with the non increasing rearrangement of the sequence n n of the eigenval ues this information is quite useful in computing diametral dimensions for exam ple in view of this observation one can readily verify that o d n n n 2 e 2 k n 1 d k 1 2 o cd n r 1 n crn 1 d pluricomplex green functions on stein manifolds 3 where d is the unit polydisc in the d dimensional complex plane cd d 1 2 for more information about diametral dimension we refer the reader to 15 20 we now recall some background material from complex potential theory let m be a connected complex manifold and z 0 m let us denote plurisub harmonic functions on an open m by the symbol psh the pluricomplex green function gm z 0 with a pole at w 0 is defined as gm z z 0 sup u psh m u 0 onm c u z ln z w 0 c z uz 0 where uz 0 is some local neighborhood near z 0 see 13 it turns out that either gm is a plurisubharmonic function that is maximal on m or is we will say that pluricomplex green function with a pole at z 0 exists in case gm z 0 6 pluricomplex green functions are natural analogues in several variables of the classical green functions in the theory of open riemann surfaces and were studied in diverse settings see 13 9 18 our first result connecting pluricomplex green functions and diametral dimen sion comes basically from 4 indeed corollary 4 3 theorem 2 9 and proposition 4 1 of 4 combined yields theorem 1 1 let m be a stein manifold of dimension d and suppose that o m o d then pluricomplex green function exists for each point of m however the statement of the above theorem is not an if and only if statement as the example below reveals example 1 2 let m c c 2 clearly pluricomplex green function exists for each point 0 z 0 w 0 of m indeed the function g z w 0 ln z z 0 1 zz 0 is the pluricomplex green function for m with a pole at 0 we now examine the diametral dimension of o m the nuclear fre chet space o m admits a schauder basis znwm where z n z w zn wm z w wm n m 0 1 we choose the exhaustion dk z w m z e 1 k w ek of m k 1 2 and set hk 1 k k for 0 1 k 1 2 using the h 2 dk norms k 1 2 to generate the topology of o m we obtain a sequence space representation of o m of the form o m n m n m 0 n m k n m n m 2 e 2 hk n n m 1 2 k 1 2 where as usual we used the notation n m for n m n n the corresponding fundamental system of neighborhoods are uk f n m n mz n w m n m k 1 k 1 2 4 aydin aytuna fix a k n k 2 k and 0 1 whose values we will specify later we will use the usual lexicographical order for n n and set n n m for n m n m 0 1 as was mentioned in the introduction the sequence of kolmogorov diameters d 0 uk uk dn uk uk coincides with the non increasing rearrangement of e 2 hk hk n n evidently for a fixed j 1 1 j j 1 hk hk j k k where a denotes the number of elements of the set a and j k k ln dj uk uk j 0 1 on the lattice points 1 since hk hk k k we have 1 hk hk j k k 1 k k j k k 1 2 1 k k j k k 2 1 k k j k k k j k k 2 where k 1 2 1 2 k k 1 k k on the remaining lattice points 1 since k 2 k we estimate 1 hk hk j k k 1 2 k j k k a crude estimate on the number of lattice points in the wedge with base an interval in the unit simplex starting from 0 1 with length 2 and with norm less than or equal to 2 k j k k yields 1 2 k j k k 1 2 4 k 2 2 k k now choose so that k 2 and k so that k 1 it follows from these choices and inequality 1 1 that j 3 j k k 2 3 ln 1 dj k k 2 or 1 2 dj uk uk e 1 3 j j 1 since j was arbitrary the nuclearity of o m implies that e 1 3 j j o m see 10 on the other hand since o 2 j j j 2 e 2 j k k 1 2 e 1 3 j j o 2 for more information about the diametral dimension of spaces of analytic func tions on complete reinhardt domains in cn we refer the reader to 5 7 pluricomplex green functions on stein manifolds 5 2 semi proper pluricomplex green functions the sublevel sets of the pluricomplex green functions of the above example are far from being relatively compact moreover the poles of these pluricomplex green functions are not strict in the sense of poletsky recall that a function g on a complex manifold is said to have a strict logarithmic pole at a point w in case there are a coordinate neighborhood u and constants c 1 and c 2 such that ln z w c 1 g w ln z w c 2 on u see 18 one can ask as to whether these features account for the difference o m 6 o 2 in the example above in what follows we will call a real valued function f on a topological space x semi proper in case there exists a c r such that the sublevel set 6 x x f x c is relatively compact in x to answer the question posed above we will enquire into the existence of semi proper pluricomplex green functions definition 2 1 let m be a stein manifold and k k be a generating norm system for o m for z m we will say that m has the property z in case there exists a ball with radius 0 in some coordinate system around z b z b z m such that k 1 0 k k 1 c 0 uk 1 c r u 0 r uk r 0 where u 0 f o m supw b z f w 1 clearly this condition does not depend on the generating norm system of o m now we can state the main theorem of this section theorem 2 2 let m be a stein manifold and 0 m the following statements are equivalent 1 there exists a negative plurisubharmonic function onm that has a relatively compact sublevel set containing 0 2 m possesses a semi proper pluricomplex green function with a strict loga rithmic pole at 0 3 m has the property 0 proof 1 2 the proof of this implication is a gluing argument see e g 3 we give it in detail since we will utilize the explicit form of some of the functions appearing in the proof in a later discussion let 1 be a negative plurisubharmonic function given in the assumption and assume that z 1 z c is relatively compact for some c 0 and contains 0 choose a ball b 0 in a coordinate neighborhood of 0 such that b 0 z 1 z c and set 2 z 1 c where c max b 0 1 fix a relatively compact smooth strictly pseudoconvex domain d m con taining z 2 z c c and let gd denote the pluricomplex green function on d with a pole at 0 the function gd is continuous on d and is a proper exhaustion on d see theorem 4 3 of 9 and theorem 4 3 of 18 6 aydin aytuna choose c 1 0 c 2 0 so that z gd z c 1 b 0 z 2 z z d gd z c 2 d m set z c 2 c 1 2 c 1 and let u z d gd z c 2 v z d gd c 1 c z d gd c 2 for any v u limz z gd by construction hence the function u defined by u max gd on v gd on u v is a plurisubharmonic function on u since on z d 2 z c z d gd c 2 max gd we can extend u to be a bounded plurisubharmonic function on m by setting it equal to off z d gd z c 2 this modification makes u supz m u z a semi proper negative plurisubhar monic function on m note that u is equal to gd in a neighborhood of 0 the domain d is hyperconvex in the sense of poletsky and so gd and hence u has a strict logarithmic pole at 0 according to theorem 4 3 of 18 since gm 0 dominates u supz m u z on m gm 0 also has a strict logarithmic pole at 0 2 3 to simplify the notation we will denote the pluricomplex green function with a strict logarithmic pole at 0 by pm pick a coordinate chart u around 0 such that gm 0 ln 0 c for some c on u choose an 0 such that the ball around 0 with radius 0 b 0 in this coordinate system that satisfies b 0 u now for ln c small enough we can find an 0 such that b 0 b 0 b 0 where z m gm z 0 since is connected 17 we conclude that b 0 for this choice of hence gm 0 is a semi proper negative plurisubharmonic function on m choose 0 c 0 0 c c such that b 0 z pm z c z pm z c m pick a c strictly plurisubharmonic proper function m 0 and set dk z z k k 1 2 for some k 1 large we have b 0 z pm z c z pm z c dk 1 let dk 1 z m pm z c c define a plurisubharmonic function t on m via t z t c pm z t t 0 clearly 1 t z 0 for z b 0 t 0 2 t z 1 c c t for z t 0 we choose a hermitian metric on m and denote by dv the volume form coming from this metric using the notation of lemma 1 of 1 we set d cd where is a measure on m that is equivalent to the volume form and c is a strictly positive real valued function on m fix f o with dk 1 f 2 d 1 2 1 pluricomplex green functions on stein manifolds 7 in view of lemma 1 of 1 we can for each t 0 compose f as f f f f o f o such that f 2 e td c 1 e 1 c c t f 2 e td c 1 e 1 c c t and for some c 1 0 which is independent of f and t since c 2 0 such that f 2 e td c 2 e 1 c c t we have f 2 e td c 1 e c c t and b 0 f 2 d b 0 f 2 e td c 1 e 1 c c t set f f on f f on the analytic function f o m satisfies 2 1 k 0 m f 2 d ket c c b 0 f f 2 d b 0 f 2 c 1 e 1 c c t we set for f o m f k dk f 2 d 1 2 k 1 2 plainly k k 1 forms a fundamental system of norms generating the topology of o m and as usual we denote the unit ball corresponding to k by uk k 1 2 let b g o m m g 2 d 1 observe that b uk for each k n the above analysis can be summerized as 2 2 k 1 0 k k 1 c 0 uk 1 1 r ub 0 cruk r 1 where 0 and ub 0 f o m sup b 0 f 1 since for 0 r 1 2 2 is trivial we conclude that m has the property 0 3 1 choose a volume form dv onm and an open strictly pseudoconvex exhaustion dk k 1 dk d k 1 k 1 2 dk m ofm with 0 d 1 for f o m set k dk 2 dv 1 2 k 1 2 in view of our assumption 0 such that b 0 d 1 and 2 1 k 0 k k 1 ck 0 such that uk 1 ruk ck r u 0 r 0 8 aydin aytuna where uk s are closed unit balls corresponding to k s and u 0 f o m sup b 0 f 1 in the first part of the proof we employ the argument given in 29 16 lemma of 14 to construct a hilbert space densely imbedded in o m and satisfies a certain interpolation condition we will include this line of reasoning here for completeness in view of nuclearity ofo m for each k 1 2 and 0 k min 12 k 1 c 2 1 k 2 we can find a finite set mk uk 1 such that uk 1 kuk mk since for each k 1 2 ms uk 1 for s k the set s 1 ms is bounded in o m for each g o m we have 2 3 g k 1 k g k sup x g x where h s supx us h x is the dual norm of s s 1 2 iterating inequality 2 3 we get g o m n k 1 2 4 g n 1 n 1 n 1 n 2 n 1 0 sup x g x 0 n 1 g 0 2 sup x g x 0 n 1 g 0 where g 0 supx u 0 g x and 0 1 from 2 2 it follows that k 1 0 n k 1 cn such that g o m g k 1 r g n cn r g 0 r 0 inserting 2 4 into this expression one gets 2 5 g k 1 2 r sup x g x r 0 n 1 cn r g 0 r g o m now for cn r 2 cn 1 r 0 n

it and consider the hilbert norm 2 k 1 2 k 12 kd 2 k where dk sup k k 1 2 and let b f o m f 1 we denote by hb the hilbert space imbedded in o m whose unit ball is b taking into account the o m is separable by enlarging if necessary we can without loss of generality say that hb is dense in o m pluricomplex green functions on stein manifolds 9 in view of 2 6 2 7 d 0 g o m g k 1 r g b d r 2 g 0 r

g o m where 0 supu 0 let h denote closure of o m with respect to the hilbertian norm b 0 2 dv 1 2 since for some constant c 0 g 0 c g g o m the above statement holds for the dual norm as well the imbedding h h is compact since o m is nuclear and consequently has a representation of the form x n 0 n x fn en for an orthonormal basis fn an orthonormal system en for h and h respec tively for some null sequence n consisting of strictly positive numbers note that fn n and f n 1 n where f n fn n 0 1 set n ln 1 n since fn is a bounded sequence in o m and n the function z lim z limn ln fn n defines a plurisubharmonic function on m plainly z 0 for z m and since fn 1 for z b 0 z 1 choose a 0 1 with we will look at the sublevel set z z this set is non empty since b 0 choose a point z in view of hartog s lemma p 50 in 13 c c z such that fk z ce k k 1 2 2 9 for an f h f z n f n f fn z 10 aydin aytuna in view of 2 8 and 2 9 we have f z n f n f fn z n f n k 1 fn z f k 1 c n 1 n e n f k 1 c n e n f k 1 f k 1 for some z in the above estimate we have used the fact that increasing permutation of the sequence n n dominates by a constant times the sequence 1 dn u uk 1 n which in turn is dominates a constant times n 1 d n where d dimm see proposition 1 1 of 5 since h is dense in o m the above inequality is true for each f o m choose a relatively compact holomorphically convex d k 1 m that contains dk 1 the analysis above yields c 0 f o m f z c sup d k 1 f j 1 2 employing a well known trick of applying this inequality to fn for a given f o m taking nth root of both sides as n we conclude that z d k 1 this finishes the proof of the theorem we now look into the question posed in the beginning of the section theorem 2 3 let m be a stein manifold of degree d and suppose it satisfies one of the equivalent conditions of theorem 2 2 for some 0 m then o m o d proof choose a c strictly plurisubharmonic exhaustion function p m and let k z p k k z with p choosen such that 0 0 we assume that m has the property 0 choose b 0 k 1 and a sequence of integers kn with k 1 k 2 tending to infinity where and k 1 are as in the definition of 0 using the notation of theorem 2 2 3 1 we set v 0 f o m b 0 f 2 d 1 2 1 and vn f o m dkn f 2 d 1 2 1 n 1 2 in view of proposition 3 8 of 6 and the condition 0 we have 2 10 n 0 1 k n j and c 0 with vk 1 rjvn c r vk r 0 also we have 2 11 k 0 0 1 and c 0 f k 1 c f k f 1 k 2 pluricomplex green functions on stein manifolds 11 this two constants theorem type condition can be perceived in many ways one of which is to employ p measures in its proof as in 2 p 125 now from the discussion leading to proposition 1 1 of 5 we conclude that 0 lim lndn v 1 v 0 n lim ln dn v 1 v 0 n where n n 1 d d dimm is the associated exponent sequence of o m 5 choose r 0 large 1 r 0 such that 2 12 n 0 n n 0 1 r n 0 dn v 1 v 0 we estimate dn v 1 v 0 n n using 0 as in 21 in view of 29 13 lemma of 14 and 2 6 of the proof 2 3 of theorem 2 2 an equivalent form of 0 in our notation reads as bounded set b and 0 such that 2 13 v 1 1 r v 0 crb r 0 now suppose that 0 satisfies b v 0 l for some finite dimensional subspace l with dim l n in view of 2 13 this leads to v 1 1 r cr v 0 l r 0 and hence to dn v 1 v 0 1 r cr v 0 l r 0 taking infimum of 1 r cr over r first then taking infimum over we get 2 14 0 dn v 1 v 0 dn b v 0 1 we claim that o m 6 o cd n r 1 and c 0 n cr n anticipating a contradiction we assume that o m o cd choose an r r 1 1 0 since r n n o cd m n such that 2 15 lim n r ndn vm v 0 0 so by 2 12 and 2 14 r r 1 1 0 n r ndn v 1 v 0 1 1 1 1 r ndn b v 0 cr ndn vm v 0 hence 2 15 gives us the desired contradiction in view of theorem 4 4 of 4 we conclude that o m o d this finishes the proof of the theorem we now look at some immediate corollaries of theorem 2 3 corollary 2 4 letm be an open riemann surface then the following are equiv alent 1 m is hyperbolic 2 m possesses a semi proper negative subharmonic function 12 aydin aytuna 3 m b 0 1 n supn n rn r 1 proof ifm is hyperbolic it has a non trivial green s function gm at each point of m which is harmonic except at its singularity fix a point m and a small ball b in some chart around consider the sublevel set z gm z c where c min b gm such a c 0 exists since gm is continuous taking into account that the sublevel sets of the green functions are connected 17 we conclude that z gm z c b so m has a semi proper negative subharmonic function the other implications are consequences of theorem 2 3 and theorem 1 1 respectively another consequence of theorem 2 3 and theorem 1 1 is corollary 2 5 letm be a stein manifold ifm possesses a semi proper complex green function with a pole at 0 m then for each m pluricomplex green function with a pole at exists we would like to close this section by recalling a linear topological invariant introduced by d vogt 22 from the structure theory of nuclear fre chet spaces definition 2 6 let x be a fre chet space and k k a fundamental system of seminorms generating the topology x is said to have the property in case k 0 k 1 0 k k 1 c 0 uk 1 c r uk 0 r uk r 0 where as usual us denotes the closed unit ball of the local banach space xs s 1 2 this property does not depend upon the generating system k and is in fact a linear topological invariant that is if x has then any fre chet space isomorphic to x as a linear topological space also enjoys this property like all type conditions passes through quotient spaces for more informa tion about the property we refer the reader to 22 11 stein manifolds m for which o m possesses the property were characterized in 3 plainly the property for o m m a stein manifold implies that m possesses the property for every point is m consequently appears as a linear topological invariant of o m that ensures for every m the existence of a semi proper negative plurisubharmonic on m with a relatively compact sublevel set containing on the other hand possessing at every point for a stein manifold m need not imply that o m has the property to see this consider the punctured disc b 0 1 0 c this domain obviously enjoys the property for each of its points employing laurent expansion for analytic functions on the punctured disc it is not difficult to show that o b 0 1 0 o c o b 0 1 as fre chet spaces see 20 p 376 if the space of analytic functions on this punctured disc had the property o c being a quotient ofo b 0 1 0 would also enjoy this property but this cannot be eg in view of theorem 2 3 and the above remarks pluricomplex green functions on stein manifolds 13 3 pluri greenian and locally uniformly pluri greenian complex manifolds e poletsky in 18 introduced the concepts of pluri greenian and locally uni formly pluri greenian complex manifolds in this section we look into these notions from our point of view a complex manifold m is called pluri greenian if for each m the pluricom plex green function gm has a strict logarithmic pole at on pluri green manifolds the pluricomplex green function gm satisfies ddcgm d 2 d if d is the dimension of the manifold consequently in view of theorem 2 2 a stein manifold m is pluri greenian if and only if it has the property z for every z m recall that a complex manifold m is called locally uniformly pluri greenian in case every point w 0 m has a coordinate neighborhood u with the following property there is an open set w u containing w 0 and a constant c such that gm z w ln z w c on u whenever w w see 18 19 balls in cn plainly satisfy the required property hence bounded domains in cn are locally uniformly pluri greenian it turns out that existence of a pluricomplex green function with a strict logarithmic pole at each point of a complex manifold ensures that it is locally uniformly pluri greenian theorem 3 1 1 a complex manifold is uniformly pluri greenian if and only if it is pluri greenian 2 a stein manifold m is uniformly pluri greenian if and only if it has the property z for each z m proof let m be a complex manifold and w 0 m suppose there exists a pluri complex green function gm w 0 with a strict logarithmic pole at w 0 that is there exists numbers a and b such that ln z w a gm z w 0 ln z w b on a coordinate neighborhood u 0 around w 0 choose r 0 and 0 for the time being so that z z u 0 gm z w 0 b w 0 e a and b w 0 e a b w 0 r u 0 where b w r denotes the ball around w u 0 with radius r 0 in u 0 since the sub level sets of gm w 0 are connected z z m gm z w 0 b w 0 r u 0 chooser r such thatb w 0 r and set 0 sup b w 0 r gm w 0 set z gm z w 0 0 z m the plurisubharmonic function is bounded and semi proper since z z 0 b w 0 r let g denote the pluricomplex green function of b w 0 r with a pole at w 0 choose constants r 1 and r 2 r 1 r 2 such that z b w 0 r g z r 1 b w 0 r b w 0 e a z b w 0 r g z r 2 b w 0 r 14 aydin aytuna set z r 2 r 1 0 z r 1 z m and z b w 0 r g z r 2 define a function u on by the formula u z max g on z b w 0 r g z r 1 c g z on z b w 0 r g z r 1 by our construction u becomes a plurisubharmonic function note that outside b w 0 e a gm z w 0 so 0 outside b w 0 e a hence by setting u outside we can extend u to m to a bounded plurisubharmonic function on m note that on m u z sup m r 2 r 1 0 0 r 1 setting um r 2 r 1 0 0 r 1 the function v u um becomes a negative plurisubharmonic function on m that is equal to g um on a ball around wo where g is the pluricomplex green function of a ball of radius r with center w 0 in a coordinate chart around wo note that the dependence of to the function g is through the constants r 1 and r 2 that satisfy the conditions above if one could select r 1 and r 2 such that the con ditions required by these numbers are fulfilled by all pluricomplex green functions of b w 0 r with poles that lie in a fixed small ball around w 0 one can then use the function defined above and carry out the above argument simultaneously for all pluricomplex green functions with poles in this neighborhood and thereby obtain a negative plurisubharmonic function onm for each x in this neighborhood which equals to gx c for some c that does not depend upon x on a fixed neighborhood w of w 0 where gx denotes the pluricomplex green function of b w 0 r with a pole at x we claim that such a choice of constants is possible in other words we wish to show that s 1 and s 2 s 1 s 2 0 and 0 b w 0 z u 0 gx z s 1 b w 0 r and b w 0 e a z b w 0 r gx z s 2 b w 0 r for every x in a fixed neighborhood of w 0 to this end choose r 1 and r 2 such that the condition is satisfied for x w 0 in view of lemma 6 2 4 of 13 choose balls around w 0 b and b 0 such that w 0 b b 0 z b w 0 r gw 0 z r 1 1 gw 0 z gx z 1 1 gw 0 z x b z u 0 b 0 and 0 to be chosen later on gw 0 r 1 gx r 11 hence gx z r 1 1 on z gw 0 r 1 for all x b consequently we can find a 0 such that b w 0 z u 0 gw 0 r 1 z u 0 gx z r 1 1 for all x b on the other hand for z b 0 and x b one has gx z r 1 1 gw 0 z r 1 1 2 pluricomplex green functions on stein manifolds 15 choose 0 so small that z gw 0 z r 1 1 2 b w 0 r it follows that z b w 0 r gx z r 11 b w 0 r x b choose a ball aroundw 0 that is contained compactly in z b w 0 r gw 0 z r 2 and contains b w 0 e a on the boundary of gx r 21 for x b so b w 0 e a z b w 0 r gx z r 2 1 we put another condition on by requiring that z b w 0 r gw 0 z r 2 1 2 b w 0 r it now follows that z b w 0 r gx z r 2 1 b w 0 r by choosing 0 satisfying the requirements stated above and setting s 1 r 1 1 s 2 r 2 1 one proves the claim now since b w 0 r is locally uniformly pluri greenian there are open neigh borhoods w and u of w 0 w u contained in b and a constant c such that gx z ln z x c on u whenever x w combining this with the analysis above finishes the proof of the first part of the theorem the second part of the theorem follows directly from the first part theorem 2 2 and the proposition above 4 concluding remarks i we would like to point out that the results about locally uniformly pluri greenian complex manifolds obtained by e poletsky in his papers 18 19 are valid in view of theorem 3 1 for pluri greenian complex manifolds this in particular applies to the construction in 19 of pluri potential compactifications for locally uniformly pluri greenian complex manifolds poletsky introduced biholomorphically invari ant pluri potential compactifications for complex manifolds in 19 as a counterpart to the martin compactification in the classical potential theory consequently the orem 3 1 and theorem 2 1 implies corollary 4 1 let m be a stein manifold and suppose the fre chet space o m has the property then m admits a pluri potential compactification in the sense of poletsky ii in 12 harz shcherbina and tomassini introduced the notion of a core of a complex manifold m c m as the set of all points w m where every smooth bounded from above global plurisubharmonic function fails to be strictly plurisub harmonic in w in the example of section 1 the core of the manifold is plainly itself poletsky and shcherbina in 17 corollary 3 3 showed that complex manifolds possess pluricomplex green functions with strict logarithmic singularities at points outside their core combining this result with theorem 2 2 of section 2 we get 16 aydin aytuna corollary 4 2 a stein manifold m satisfies for all points m that lie outside its core iii chen and zhang in their paper 8 considered stein manifolds whose pluri complex green functions are semi proper and specified them as manifolds that satisfy the property b 1 they showed among other things that stein manifolds satisfying property b 1 possesses a bergman metric 8 theorem 1 this result and theorem 2 2 of section 2 yields corollary 4 3 a stein manifold m satisfying for all its points possesses a bergman metric acknowledgement the
