category of complex symplectic varieties which admit certain singularities it includes symplectic v manifolds cf fu 1 and o grady s singular moduli spaces of semi stable torsion free sheaves on a k 3 surface o cf na introduction a normal compact ka hler space z is a symplectic variety if its regular locus u admits a non degenerate holomorphic closed 2 form with the following property for any resolution z z of z with 1 u u the 2 form on 1 u extends to a holomorphic 2 form on z if z can be embedded in a projective space z is called a projective symplectic variety our purpose is to give a positive answer to the following problem posed in na problem let z be a q factorial projective symplectic variety with termi nal singularities assume that z is smoothable by a suitable flat deformation is z then non singular from the first we actually prove more main theorem let z be a q factorial projective symplectic variety with terminal singularities then any flat deformation of z is locally trivial in other words it preserves all singularities on z this theorem would explain why local torelli theorem na theorem 8 holds for such symplectic varieties example o cf also k l s let s be a k 3 surface with picard number 1 fix an even integer c with c 6 let mc be the moduli space of semi stable sheaves on s of rank 2 with c 1 0 and c 2 c o grady proved in 1 http arxiv org abs math 0506534 v 5 1 introduction 2 o that mc is a projective symplectic variety with terminal singularities in the preprint version of o math ag 9708009 he constructed a projective resolution m c mc let n 1 m c mc be the r vector space of numerical classes of 1 cycles l on m c such that l point then n 1 m c mc r c r c r c for effective 1 cycles c c and c ibid section 3 on the other hand exc consists of three prime divisors c c and c ibid section 3 this implies that mc is q factorial in fact let d be a prime divisor of mc and let d be its proper transform on m c by the observation above we can find ai q i 1 2 3 such that d d a 1 c a 2 c a 3 c is numerically trivial since mc has only rational singularities there is a positive integer m such that md is linearly equivalent to the pull back of a cartier divisor e of mc then md is linearly equivalent to e more generally for a k 3 surface or an abelian surface almost all moduli spaces of semi stable sheaves with non primitive mukai vectors are q factorial projective symplectic varieties k l s applying main theorem to these moduli spaces we conclude that any deformation of them are locally rigid in particular they have no smoothing via deformations in the final section we shall apply main theorem to get the following remarkable results corollary 1 let h y z and h y z be two q factorial terminalizations of a projective symplectic variety z in other words h resp h is a crepant projective birational morphism such that y resp y has only q factorial terminal singularities assume that y is non singular then y is also non singular remark 1 a q factorial terminalization y of a projective symplectic variety z is again symplectic in fact there is a 2 form h on h 1 u where u zreg by the definition of a symplectic variety this 2 form extends to a holomorphic 2 form on v yreg moreover since ky h kz the extended 2 form is non degenerate over v if we take a resolution y of y then this 2 form further extends to a holomorphic 2 form on y example flops when the codimensions of exc h and exc h are both larger than one corollary 1 says that the smoothness is preserved un der a flop a similar result has been proved by kaledin under certain condi tions when z is an affine symplectic singularity cf symplectic resolutions http arxiv org abs math 9708009 2 proof of main theorem 3 deformations snd birational maps math ag 0012008 corollary 2 let z be a projective symplectic variety assume that z has a q factorial terminalization h y z then the following are equivalent 1 z is smoothable by a flat deformation 2 y is non singular the following conjecture would be true if any projective symplectic vari ety had a q factorial terminalization cf remark 2 1 conjecture a projective symplectic variety is smoothable by a defor mation if and only if it admits a crepant symplectic resolution remark 2 1 the existence of a q factorial terminalization follows from the minimal model conjecture in fact let z z be a projective resolution if the minimal model conjecture holds one can get a q factorial terminalization y z after running the minimal model program for z over the fixed base z the q factorial terminalizations are not unique however they have the same kind of singularities by virtue of the proof of corollary 1 the minimal model conjecture is proved by shokurov sh in dimension 4 2 it would be interesting to know whether our results also hold in the case where z is a convex symplectic variety here we say that z is convex if there is a birational projective morphism from z to an affine symplectic singularity x when x has non isolated singularity the usual deformation theory of z and x has an infinite dimensional nature and does not work well instead we should consider a poisson deformation cf g k 2 proof of main theorem i q factoriality a normal variety z is called q factorial if for any weil divisor d of z md is a cartier divisor of z for some positive integer m assume that z is a projective variety with rational singularities let z z be a resolution such that the exceptional locus consists of finite number of divisors ei 1 i m denote by ei h 2 z z the corresponding classes by ko mo 12 1 6 z is q factorial if and only if im h 2 z q h 0 z r 2 q im q ei h 0 z r 2 q http arxiv org abs math 0012008 2 proof of main theorem 4 we give here a proof of the only if part fix an ample class h 2 z q let h 20 z q be the primitive part of h 2 z q by definition we have h 2 z q h 20 z q q since z has only rational singularities the natural maph 2 z q h 2 z q is an injection of mixed hodge structures de hence by the strict com patibility of weight filtrations h 2 z q admits a pure q hodge structure of weight 2 then h 20 z q h 2 z q h 20 z q also admits a pure q hodge structure of weight 2 note that h 20 z c contains h 2 0 z and h 0 2 z with respect to the hodge riemann bilinear form on h 20 z q we put v h 20 z q one can check that v h 20 z q 0 and hence h 2 z q v q h 20 z q note thath 20 z q is mapped to zero by the maph 2 z q h 0 z r 2 q since every element of v is of type 1 1 we see that im h 2 z q h 0 z r 2 q im pic z q h 0 z r 2 q now take a q cartier divisor d of z the push forward d is a q cartier divisor of z since z is q factorial now the pull back d of d is well defined and one has d d aiei for some ai q this implies the only if part ii terminal singularity we recall the definition of a terminal sin gularity assume for simplicity that z is a normal variety such that the canonical divisor kz is a cartier divisor we say that z has only terminal resp canonical singularities if for a resolution z z such that the exceptional locus consists of finite number of divisors ei 1 i m kz kz aiei with ai 0 resp ai 0 for all i let z be the singular locus if z has only terminal singularities then we have codim z 3 cf re but 2 proof of main theorem 5 if in addition z is a symplectic variety then we have codim z 4 by na 2 k conversely if z is a symplectic variety with codim z 4 then z has only terminal singularities na 2 iii infinitesimal deformations assume that z is a reduced complex space recall that a deformation z of z over an analytic space s with a reference point 0 s is a flat map z s with a fixed isomorphism z s 0 z when 0 s is a spectrum of an artinian local c algebra with a unique point z is called an infinitesimal deformation of z moreover an infinitesimal deformation z s is called locally trivial if for any stein open set v z z v v s for n 0 we put an c t t n 1 and sn specan suppose that zn sn is an infinitesimal deformation of z over sn define tzn sn hom 1 zn sn ozn let sn spec an 2 there is a natural closed immersion sn sn moreover the injection an an 2 induces a map sn sn ext 1 1 zn sn ozn plays an important role in the deformation theory of a reduced complex space iii a there is a one to one correspondence between ext 1 1 zn sn ozn and the set of equivalence classes of infinitesimal deformations of zn over sn here two infinitesimal deformations zn and z n of zn over sn are equiv alent if there is an sn isomorphism between them which induces over sn the identity map of zn the correspondence is given in the following manner assume an in finitesimal deformation zn is given by the map sn sn we regard zn as an sn analytic space there is an exact sequence ozn d 1 zn sn an an 1 zn sn 0 here d is defined by d f fd for f ozn by using the fact that z is reduced one can show that this d is an injection hence we have an element of ext 1 1 zn sn ozn since zn is flat over sn ozn ozn conversely let there be an element of ext 1 1 zn sn ozn ext 1 1 zn sn ozn this element gives an ozn module extension of 1 zn sn by ozn we con sider this extension as an an module extension then by the homomorphism ext 1 an 1 zn sn ozn ext 1 an ozn ozn induced by d ozn 1 zn sn 2 proof of main theorem 6 we have the commutative diagram of exact sequences 0 ozn g ozn 0 id y d y d y 0 ozn f 1 zn sn 0 1 by definition g f g f ozn f dg we give a ring structure to g by f g f g g f gf gg by the inclusion ozn f we regard as an element of f then g is an an 2 algebra by defining f g g 0 for f g g now put g ozn then zn ozn is an infinitesimal deformation of zn ozn over sn remark another approach to prove iii a is to use the cotangent com plex and the associated tangent cohomology cf l s pa bi 5 let l zn sn be the cotangent complex for zn sn we put t izn sn ext i l zn sn ozn and t i zn sn exti l zn sn ozn by the definition of the cotangent complex one has t 0 zn sn tzn sn more over if z is reduced then the argument of ar 2 prop 6 1 shows that t 1 zn sn ext 1 1 zn sn ozn since there is a natural map of complexes l zn sn 1 zn sn we get the maps exti exti 1 zn sn ozn t i zn sn and exti exti 1 zn sn ozn t i zn sn therefore we have a commutative diagram of local to global exact sequences h 1 tzn sn ext 1 h 0 ext 1 h 2 tzn sn y y y y h 1 t 0 zn sn t 1 zn sn h 0 t 1 zn sn h 2 t 0 zn sn 2 by this diagram we see that ext 1 1 zn sn ozn t 1 zn sn when z is reduced 2 proof of main theorem 7 next let us consider a locally trivial deformation zn sn of z locally trivial deformations are controlled by h 1 z tzn sn instead of ext 1 iii b there is a one to one correspondence between h 1 z tzn sn and the set of equivalence classes of locally trivial deformations of zn over sn first let us take a stein open cover vi i i of zn then each locally trivial deformation zn of zn is constructed by patching vi sn sn together in such a way that over sn it gives the original zn now the situation is the same as the usual deformation of a non singular variety by the same argument as sga 1 expose iii 6 we have the above correspondence iv assume that z is a q factorial projective symplectic variety with terminal singularities by ii codim z 4 where sing z we define an and sn as in iii suppose that zn sn is an infinitesimal deformation of z over sn let u be the regular part of z we put un zn u lemma 1 the natural map h 1 z tzn sn ext 1 1 zn sn ozn is a bijection proof it suffices to show that the map ext 1 1 zn sn ozn h 0 z ext 1 1 zn sn ozn is the zero map take a point p let z p be a small stein open neighborhood of p z and set u p z p u we put zn p zn z p and un p un u p we prove that ext 1 1 zn sn ozn h 0 zn p ext 1 1 zn p sn ozn p is the zero map since z is cohen macaulay and codim z 3 by ko mo 12 5 6 one has ext 1 1 zn sn ozn h 1 un tun sn and h 0 zn p ext 1 1 zn p sn ozn p h 1 un p tun p sn since the symplectic 2 form extends to n h 0 un 2 un sn by na we can identify tun sn with 1 un sn by this relative 2 form now we only have to prove that h 1 un 1 un sn h 1 un p 1 un p sn 2 proof of main theorem 8 is the zero map let us consider the hodge spectral sequences hj un i un sn h i j u an and hj un p i un p sn h i j u p an where an is the constant sheaf with coefficient an in the latter spec tral sequence we have a decreasing filtration 0 f 2 loc f 1 loc f 0 loc h 2 u p an by the depth argument e 0 1 1 h 1 un p oun p 0 be cause z is cohen macaulay and codim z 3 so there is an injection gr 1 floc h 2 u p an h 1 un p 1 un p sn in particular we have a map f 1 loc h 1 un p 1 un sn on the other hand the first spectral sequence degenerates at e 1 terms for i j 2 cf na 1 lemma 2 7 because codim z 4 hence for the decreasing filtration f of h 2 u an gr 1 f h 2 u an h 1 un 1 un sn in particular we have a surjection f 1 h 1 un 1 un sn the inclusion map u p u induces a map of the second cohomologies say p p h 2 u an h 2 u p an this map preserves the filtrations f and f loc hence it induces a map f 1 f 1 loc by the commutative diagram f 1 h 1 un 1 un sn f 1 loc h 1 un p 1 un sn we only have to prove that the map p is the zero map take a resolution z z such that 1 u u put z p 1 z p let us consider the commutative diagram h 2 z an h 2 u an h 2 z p an h 2 u p an here note thath 2 an h 2 c can since z is q factorial im h 2 z an h 2 z p an is generated by ei s as an an module by i where ei are exceptional divisors of therefore the composite h 2 z an h 2 z p an h 2 u p an 3 applications 9 is the zero map on the other hand the map h 2 z an h 2 u an is a surjection by an argument in na proposition 9 cf b p 143 because codim z 4 now p is the zero map by the commutative diagram q e d let us start the proof of main theorem let a be an artinian local c algebra and put s spec a recall that a deformation z s of z is locally trivial if for any stein open set v z z v v s we can introduce a locally trivial deformation functor of z dlt art c set as a sub functor of the usual deformation functor d of z one can check that dlt has a pro representable hull rlt zrlt in the sense of schlessinger sch here rlt is a complete local c algebra and zrlt is a certain projective system of infinitesimal deformations of z moreover by the definition of dlt one can construct rlt as a suitable quotient of the hull r of the usual deformation functor d d has t 1 lifting property as noted in na for the relationship between t 1 lifting property and unobstructedness of deformations see ka na 3 hence by lemma 1 and iii b we see that dlt also has t 1 lifting property this implies that r and rlt are both complete regular local ring over c since their cotangent spaces coincide again by lemma 1 we conclude that r rlt this implies that any flat deformation of z is locally trivial 3 applications in this section we shall generalize theorem 2 2 of na 1 to the case of q factorial terminalizations cf theorem 1 and apply main theorem and theorem 1 to get corollaries 1 and 2 propositions 1 and 2 are preliminaries for the proof of theorem 1 let us recall some generalities on deformation theory let y be a compact complex space then it has been proved by gr do pa and others that there is a kuranishi space 0 def y and a semi universal deformation f y def y of y with f 1 0 y assume that h y z is a proper map of compact complex spaces such that r 1 h oy 0 and h oy oz let y def y and z def z be the semi universal deformations then one can construct two maps h def y def z and h y z in such 3 applications 10 a way that the following diagram commutes cf ko mo 11 4 y h z y y def y h def z 3 for the convenience of readers we shall give a sketch of the construction of h and h according to ko mo 11 4 first note that h and h exist in the formal category by wa we want to construct them in the analytic category let g y z be the graph of h we shall find a graph g y z in such a way that g y z g let us consider the component d of the relative douady space of y z def y def z containing g the projection morphism d def y has a formal section defined by the formal contraction morphism around 0 def y then by ar 1 1 5 one can find an analytic section note that when h is a birational map h t yt zh t is a birational map for t def y proposition 1 let z be a projective symplectic variety assume that h y z is a q factorial terminalization that is h is a birational mor phism and y is a q factorial projective symplectic variety with terminal sin gularities then there is a deformation of h y h z over a disc such that for t 0 h t yt zt is an isomorphism proof denote by t 0 the kuranishi space of y and let p y t be the semi universal family over t by na 1 proposition 2 5 t is smooth take a projective resolution y y in such a way that is an isomorphism outside sing y for a general t t t y t yt is a resolution moreover 1 t ut ut for the regular locus ut of yt since ut sing y note that y t is not in general a projective variety but a ka hler manifold we shall prove that one can deform yt further to a variety yt so that it contains no curves since there is a map of kuranishi spaces h t def z as noted above one has a birational morphism yt zh t but yt does not have any curve hence this birational morphism should be an isomorphism cf na 1 claim 3 p 618 since yt is a small deformation of a symplectic variety y yt is again symplectic by na a symplectic singularity is a canonical singularity cf be a canonical singularity is a rational singularity by el therefore yt has only rational singularities since yt has only rational singularities the natural map h 2 yt c h 2 y t c is an 3 applications 11 injection of mixed hodge structures de hence by the strict compatibility of weight filtrations h 2 yt c admits a pure hodge structure of weight 2 let h 2 yt c h 2 0 yt h 1 1 yt h 0 2 yt be the hodge decomposition recall again that there is an injection of pure hodge structures h 2 yt c h 2 y t c put n dimy and consider the perfect pairing h 2 n 2 y t c h 2 y t c h 2 n y t c c set vt h 2 yt c h 2 n 2 y t c here we regard h 2 yt c as a subspace of h 2 y t c claim 1 every element of vt is of type n 1 n 1 proof if we put v n 1 n 1 t vt h n 1 y t n 1 y t then we see that v n 1 n 1 t h 1 1 yt hn 1 y t n 1 y t for the serre pairing hn 1 y t n 1 y t h 1 y t 1 y t hn y t n y t c since hn 1 n 1 y t h 1 1 y t dimv n 1 n 1 t h 1 1 y t h 1 1 yt on the other hand dimvt b 2 y t b 2 yt we shall prove that dimvt dimv n 1 n 1 t in order to do this it suffices to show that all elements of h 2 y t of type 2 0 and of type 0 2 are mapped to zero by the map h 2 y t c h 0 yt r 2 t c in fact since the map h 2 yt h 2 y t is an injection of pure hodge structures of weight 2 if these are proved then the injection is actually an isomorphism at 2 0 and 0 2 parts by the conjugation it suffices to show that 0 for an element h 2 y t of type 2 0 we shall prove that for every point x yt x 0 in r 2 t c x let w y t be a projective birational morphism such that w is smooth and d t 1 x is a simple normal crossing divisor of w put h t since r 1 c 0 r 2 t c injects to r 2 h c hence we have to check that is sent to zero by the composite h 2 y t c h 2 w c r 2 h c x h 2 d c 3 applications 12 we call this composite then preserves hodge filtrations of h 2 y t and h 2 d hence it induces gr 2 f h 2 y t gr 2 f h 2 d h 2 d since gr 2 f h 2 y t gr 2 f h 2 d but since yt has rational singularities at x gr 2 f h 2 d h 0 d 2 d 0 by na 1 lemma 1 2 where 2 d 2 d torsion therefore dim vt dimv n 1 n 1 t q e d the families y y t induces the kodaira spencer maps y t tt t h 1 y t y t yt tt t ext 1 1 yt oyt since y t is versal at t t yt is surjective define a map d h 1 y t y t ext 1 1 yt oyt as the differential of the map def y t t we then have d y t yt let ut yt be the regular locus of yt then ext 1 1 yt oyt h 1 ut ut by this identification the map d coincides with the restriction maph 1 y t y t h 1 ut ut a symplectic 2 form on yt extends to a holomorphic 2 form on y t by this 2 form we have a map h 1 y t h 1 1 y t we put t 1 im tt t h 1 y t y t t 2 im tt t h 1 y t 1 y t claim 2 dim t 2 dimh 1 ut 1 ut proof let us consider the composite tt t h 1 y t 1 y t h 1 ut 1 ut by the symplectic 2 form we identify h 1 ut ut with h 1 ut 1 ut then the composite above coincides with the kodaira spencer map yt which is surjective look at the pairing h 1 y t y t h n 1 y t n 1 y t hn y t n 2 y t 3 applications 13 claim 3 in the pairing above t 1 vt 0 proof for h 1 y t y t take the corresponding infinitesimal de formation y t specc choose an element l h 2 n 2 y t c of type n 1 n 1 then l is an obstruction for the class l to remain of type n 1 n 1 under the infinitesimal deformation now the claim follows from claim 1 and the fact that r 2 p cy is a local system on t cf na 1 since t 2 is the image of t 1 by the map h 1 y t h 1 1 y t we have t 2 vt 0 by the commutative diagram of the pairing maps h 1 y t y t h n 1 y t n 1 y t hn y t n 2 y t h 1 y t 1 y t hn 1 y t n 1 y t hn y t n y t note that codim vt h n 1 n 1 y t h 1 1 yt on the other hand since h 1 1 yt h 1 ut 1 ut cf na 2 we see by claim 2 that t 2 vt with respect to the pairing above now let c be a connected curve on y t such that t c is not a point since c vt we see that c t 2 is a codimension 1 subspace of t 2 by the perfectness of in particular we can find an element t 1 such that c 6 0 the n 1 n 1 classes of curves on y t constitute a countable subset of hn 1 n 1 y t hence if we take a generic deformation y t of y t then any effective 1 cycle on y t which is not contaied in a fiber of t cannot deform sideways since y t is a kaehler morphism every 1 in na this has been proved under ceratin additional conditions h 0 yreg 2 yreg 1 h 1 y oy 0 however these conditions are not essential here we give a more direct proof to this fact by using our main theorem since y t is proper if we choose t small enough then there is an open covering vi i i of y with analytic trivializations over t vi vi t here vi y vi let us take a canonical stratification y j yj of y into locally closed smooth subsets such that y j sing y j 1 and y 0 yreg fix a nowhere vanishing c vector field of t one can lift to a c vector field i of vi t in such a way that i induces a vector field of each yj vi t for each stratum yj by using the partition of unity one can glue together i and get a globally defined vector field of y this vector field gives us a c trivialization of y over t hence rip c are constant sheaves 2 by the argument of the footenote 1 above we see that h 2 y h 2 yt and h 2 u h 2 ut with u yreg since y is q factorial one has h 2 y h 2 u hence h 2 yt h 2 ut now we get the result by the footnote 1 in p 21 of the eprint version of na math ag 0010114 http arxiv org abs math 0010114 3 applications 14 irreducible component of the douady space d y t parametrizing curves is proper over t fu 2 therefore all components dominating t parametrize the curves which are contracted to points by y y by the countability of the douady space fu 3 we now see that for a generic deformation y t of y t any holomorphic curve c on y t is t exceptional for t y t yt that is t c is a point then the variety yt has no holomorphic curves in fact if there is a curve c then one can find a curve d on y t such that t d c by using the chow lemma hi which is a contradiction let h y z be a q factorial terminalization of a projective symplectic variety z we put sing z there is a closed subset 0 of with codim 0 z 4 such that z is locally a trivial family of a rational double point along 0 in the remainder we put u z 0 and v y sing y note that h 1 u v we denote by n the dimension of z in this situation we have the following generalization of na 1 proposition 2 1 proposition 23 there is a commutative diagram ext 1 1 y oy h 1 h 1 u h 1 u ext 1 1 z oz ext 1 1 u ou where horizontal maps are both isomorphisms proof in the diagram each space corresponds to the set of first order deformations of y h 1 u z or u respectively a first order deformation of y resp h 1 u induces that of z resp u cf na 1 p 614 each vertical map is nothing but this correspondence on the other hand the horizontal maps are natural ones induced by the restriction the second horizontal map at the bottom is an isomorphism by ko mo 12 5 6 be cause codim 0 z 3 and z is cohen macaulay by the same reason ext 1 1 y oy h 1 v v we only have to prove that the first horizontal map is an isomorphism set f y h 1 u and f 0 v h 1 u note that dimf n 2 since

same argument as the proof of na 1 proposition 2 1 by na 1 claim 2 p 616 rk h n 1 y loge e 0 for k 2 then by taking the duals of the first term and the fourth term we get the conclusion since codim 0 z 4 cf na 1 p 615 as a consequence we see that gr 1 f h 2 h 1 u h 1 h 1 u 1 h 1 u http arxiv org abs math 0010114 3 applications 16 since the natural map h 1 v 1 v h 1 h 1 u 1 h 1 u coincides with the map gr 1 f h 2 v gr 1 f h 2 h 1 u we conclude that it is an isomorphism finally by the symplectic 2 form on v this map is identified with h 1 v v h 1 h 1 u h 1 u theorem 1 let h y z be a q factorial terminalization of a projec tive symplectic variety z then the kuranishi spaces def y and def z are both smooth of the same dimension the natural map cf na 1 h def y def z is a finite covering moreover z has a flat de formation to a non projective symplectic variety zt which is at the same time a small deformation of y proof when y is non singular it is nothing but theorem 2 2 of na 1 in a general case we modify the proof of na 1 in the following way first corollary 1 5 of na 1 holds true when x is a q factorial terminalization of x here the notation being the same as na 1 next proposition 1 6 of na 1 follows from a more general fact recently proved in k finally we have to replace proposition 2 1 of na 1 by proposition 2 and replace claim 3 of na 1 p 618 by proposition 1 corollary 1 let h y z and h y z be two q factorial terminalizations of a projective symplectic variety z assume that y is non singular then y is also non singular proof since h is a symplectic resolution the kuranishi space def z of z is non singular by na 1 theorem 2 2 moreover a general point of def z parametrizes a non singular variety assume now that y is singu lar by proposition 1 there is a point t def z parametrizing a suitable deformation y t of y by main theorem y does not have any smoothing via deformation hence y t does not have too this contradicts the fact that a general point of def z parametrizes a non singular variety corollary 2 let z be a projective symplectic variety assume that z has a q factorial terminalization h y z then the following are equivalent

main theorem applying proposition 1 to h y z we see that zh t yt is also non smoothable but by theorem 1 def z is non singular and hence irreducible this contradicts the assumption 1 2 1 this is
