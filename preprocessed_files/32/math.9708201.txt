of illinois urbana il 61801 usa introduction this paper considers some work done by the author and catlin cd 1 cd 2 cd 3 con cerning positivity conditions for bihomogeneous polynomials and metrics on bundles over certain complex manifolds it presents a simpler proof of a special case of the main result in cd 3 providing also a self contained proof of a generalization of the main result from cd 1 some new examples and applications appear here as well the idea is to use the bergman kernel function and some operator theory to prove purely algebraic theorems about matrices of polynomials the main idea arises from generalizing a classical factorization question see dj and rr for many aspects of factorization of non negative matrices and operators on hilbert spaces consider a real analytic matrix valued function f z z that is positive semi definite at each point is there a holomorphic matrix valued function a z such that f z z a z a z here a denotes the conjugate transpose of a in general the answer is no even when f is a scalar positive definite and its entries are bihomogeneous polynomials because such factorizations have many applications we allow ourselves a generalization we can first multiply f by powers of a scalar function r and ask whether we can factor rdf for sufficiently large d this is a natural thing to do when one studies proper holomorphic mappings between balls in different dimensions and one chooses r to be the squared euclidean norm see cd 1 for applications this multiplication also admits an interpretation in terms of metrics on tensor products of hermitian line bundles we write w for the euclidean hermitian inner product of and w on any finite dimensional complex euclidean space and 2 for the squared norm later we will use subscripts to denote l 2 norms we write v a to denote the variety defined by the simultaneous vanishing of the component functions of a holomorphic mapping a a bihomogeneous polynomial on cn is a polynomial function f cn cn c that is homogeneous of the same degree m in each set of variables we will be considering f z w which is conjugate analytic in the second set of variables the polynomial defined by f z z is real valued if and only if f z w f w z we call such an f a bihomogeneous real valued polynomial on cn of degree 2 m suppose that f is a bihomogeneous real valued polynomial of degree 2 m by elemen tary linear algebra it is possible to find holomorphic polynomial mappings a and b with finitely many components that are homogeneous of degree m and such that f z w a z a w b z b w 1 it follows from 1 that f z z a z 2 b z 2 2 1 http arxiv org abs math 9708201 v 1 suppose in addition that f z z 0 we investigate the following questions can we choose b 0 in 2 and if we cannot can we do this for rdf where r is an appropriate multiplier and d is sufficiently large suppose more generally that f z z is a matrix of bihomogeneous polynomials each of degree 2 m and that is positive semi definite at each z 6 0 can we factor z 2 df z z for sufficiently large d the following theorem gives a decisive answer in the positive definite case theorem 1 catlin d angelo suppose that f is a bihomogeneous real valued polynomial on cn of degree 2 m then f is positive away from the origin if and only there is an integer d and a holomorphic homogeneous polynomial mapping a whose components span the space of homogeneous polynomials of degree m d such that z 2 df z z a z 2 3 suppose that f z z is an r by r matrix whose entries are bihomogeneous polynomials of degree 2 m then f z z is positive definite at each point z 6 0 if and only if there is an integer d and a holomorphic homogeneous polynomial matrix a whose row vectors span the space of r tuples of homogeneous polynomials of degree m d such that z 2 df z z a z a z 4 note that 3 is the scalar version of 4 the scalar statement about f was proved in cd 1 the matrix version is a special case of a general result from cd 3 about hermitian metrics on bundles over certain complex manifolds because it is a special case some steps in the proof simplify its intrinsic interest justifies giving the simpler proof here in the scalar statement one can replace the condition that the components of a span by the condition that v a 0 the exponent required may be smaller the proof reveals that the stronger condition on a is the natural one when f z z a z a z necessarily f z z is positive semi definite at each point a general result such as theorem 1 cannot hold in the positive semi definite case for the following simple reason suppose r 1 for simplicity if the zero set of f is not an analytic variety then there is no hope to write z 2 df z z a z 2 because the zero set of the right side is an analytic variety a simple example where the zero set of a bihomogeneous polynomial fails to be an analytic variety is given by 5 f z z z 1 2 z 2 2 2 5 some results hold under specific hypotheses in the semi definite case but most of this paper considers only the positive definite case we give a complete proof of theorem 1 relying on the bergman kernel function for the unit ball in theorem 2 we give a simple application to elliptic pde in theorem 3 we reinterpret theorem 1 in terms of the universal bundle over complex projective space we also provide some illuminating examples along the way we close the paper with some brief remarks about factorization theorems proved in the 1970 s 2 i holomorphic factorability suppose that we are given an r by r matrix f z w whose entries fij z w are biho mogeneous polynomials of degree 2 m on cn let n n n m denote the dimension of the vector space of homogeneous polynomials of degree m in n variables we write vd for the vector space of r tuples of homogeneous polynomials of degree d on cn definition 1 the r by r matrix of bihomogeneous polynomials f z w of degree 2 m is called holomorphically factorable if there is an integer s and a matrix ejk z for j 1 r and k 1 s of homogeneous polynomials of degree m such that 6 holds fij z w ej z ei w s k 1 ejk z eik w 6 here ej z ej 1 z ejs z let a be the transpose of e we observe immediately that definition 1 implies that f z w a w a z 7 definition 2 the matrix of bihomogeneous polynomials f z w of degree 2 m is called strictly holomorphically factorable if it is holomorphically factorable and in addition the s column vectors of ejk z are a basis for vd note that the notion of strict holomorphic factorability requires that we choose s n the first concept allows us to write 7 forcing f z z to be positive semi definite the second concept ensures that f z z is positive definite but it is an even stronger condition we give a simple example when r 1 to illustrate the difference example let f z w be the one by one matrix given by z 21 w 1 2 z 22 w 2 2 here definition 1 holds with e 1 z z 2 1 z 2 2 note that f z z is positive definite away from the origin but the absence of the z 1 z 2 cross term means that definition 2 fails ii the link to operator theory we will prove theorem 1 by using some facts about compact operators on a hilbert space because we consider matrices of bihomogeneous polynomials and use the eu clidean norm as a multiplier it suffices to consider the hilbert space h of r tuples of l 2 functions on the unit ball b in complex euclidean space cn we let a denote the closed subspace of r tuples of holomorphic functions in l 2 b we write p for the bergman projection from h to a it is the usual bergman projection acting on each component there is an orthogonal decomposition of a into the finite dimensional subspaces vd the following result provides the crucial link between matrices whose entries are bihomo geneous polynomials and operator theory on a proposition let f z z fij z z be an r by r matrix of bihomogeneous poly nomials of degree 2 d on cn the following are equivalent 1 the matrix f is strictly holomorphically factorable thus there is an s by r matrix e z of holomorphic homogeneous polynomials whose column vectors give a basis for vd for each z 6 0 furthermore with a the transpose of e 8 holds 3 f z w a w a z 8 2 consider the integral operator t vd vd defined by th z j b i fij z w hi w dv w 9 then t is positive on vd that is there is a positive constant c so that for h vd th h h c h 2 h 10 3 write fij z w fij z w 11 for constants fij then the matrix fij is positive definite on c nr cr cn that is there is a positive constant c so that fij titjs s c tis 2 c ti 2 s 2 12 proof first we show that 1 implies 2 given h vd a we write h h 1 hr we assume that 6 holds and compute the left side of 10 to obtain th h h s k 1 r i j 1 eik w ejk z hi w hj z dv w dv z s k 1 j ejk z hj z dv z 2 s k 1 ak h h 2 13 the condition of strict holomorphic factorability guarantees that the vectors ak the column vectors of e form a basis for vd the last expression in 13 is therefore c h 2 h this proves that 1 implies 2 next we show that 3 implies 1 recall that n is the dimension of the space of homogeneous polynomials of degree d in n variables and that fij is an r by r matrix if 12 holds there is a basis ei of c nr so that fij ej ei plug this in 11 to obtain fij z w fij z w ej ei z w 14 now define aj z by aj z ej z we see that fij z w aj z ai w 15 and hence that 1 holds it remains to prove that 2 implies 3 we write hi z hi z and we plug this into th h h recall that distinct monomials are orthogonal so we may write 4 th h h fij z w hi w hj z dv w dv z fij hi hj p p 16 where the positive numbers p are equal to z 2 l 2 on the other hand we have h 2 h hi 2 p by a similar calculation thus 10 implies that there is a positive constant c so that fij p p hi hj c hi 2 p 17 since the p are positive numbers 17 implies that the matrix with entries fij is also positive definite with a different constant c this gives 3 iii proof of theorem 1 suppose that the entries of f are bihomogeneous polynomials of degree 2 m let qd be the operator on vm d whose kernel is given by z w df z w in order to prove theorem 1 proposition 1 implies that we must find an integer d so that qd is positive definite on vm d we observe immediately that if this holds for some d then it holds for all larger integers see cd 1 whose title suggests this stabilization process furthermore the operators qd are zero except on vm d this suggests considering their sum weighted by positive constants on the whole space a if we choose the positive constants cd appropriately then cd z w d n n 1 1 z w n 1 b z w 18 here b z w is the bergman kernel function for the unit ball b in complex euclidean space cn the crucial property of the bergman kernel function is that it is the integral kernel of the bergman projection mapping l 2 b to its closed subspace a 2 b of holomorphic functions the kernel function satisfies b z w z w where the collection is any complete orthonormal set for the hilbert space a 2 b for the unit ball one can choose c z where c is a normalizing constant and z denotes the indicated monomial recall that h denotes the cartesian product of r copies of l 2 b let p h a denote the bergman projection acting componentwise motivated by 18 we let q denote the integral operator on h whose kernel is given by b z w f z w for a scalar function we let m denote the operator on h given by multiplication by also mf denotes matrix multiplication by f there is no integration involved in these operators choose a smooth non negative function of compact support that is positive near the origin we may write 5 q mfp pm q mfp pm t 1 t 2 t 3 19 we claim that t 1 is positive and that t 2 and t 3 are compact this will show that q s k where s is positive on a and k is compact lemma 1 t 1 is positive on all of a and t 3 is compact on h proof the second statement is immediate because the integral kernel is smooth everywhere on the ball the first statement follows because p is a self adjoint projection to see this let h a t 1 h h h mfph pm h h h mfh h h m h h h mf h h h 20 since the multiplier f is strictly positive definite at all points the last expression in 20 is at least c h 2 h and the result follows lemma 2 t 2 is compact proof this follows from theorem 1 in cd 2 but is elementary in this case because of the explicit nature of the bergman kernel the kernel of q mfp is n n f z w f z z 1 z w n 1 the numerator a matrix of polynomials vanishes on the boundary diagonal where the only singularities of the denominator occur one can use young s inequality to verify that t 2 is compact we summarize what we have proved so far the operator q on h has kernel given by b z w f z w by lemmas 1 and 2 we have written q s k where s is positive on a and k is compact the operator q vanishes off a and we have a vj write qd for the restriction of q to vm d if we show that qd is positive on vm d for sufficiently large d then an application of proposition 1 completes the proof of theorem 1 since s is positive there is c 0 so that sh h h c h 2 h since k is compact there is a finite rank operator l such that the operator norm k l c 3 see r write q s l k l so that qh h h sh h h lh h h k l h h h 21 using the lower bound on s and because k l h h h c 3 h 2 h we can write qh h h c h 2 h c 3 h 2 h lh h h 2 c 3 h 2 h lh h h 22 because l is finite rank we can choose d 0 sufficiently large such that for d d 0 the restriction of l to vm d satisfies lh h h c 3 h 2 h also combining this with 22 implies that the restriction of q to vm d is positive by proposition 1 its kernel z w df z w can be written a w a z completing the proof of theorem 1 6 iv examples and applications the integer d in theorem 1 can be arbitarily large even when f has fixed degree the example fc z z z 1 4 c z 1 z 2 2 z 2 4 is positive away from the origin for c 2 by theorem 1 for each c with c 2 there is a minimum dc for which 3 holds it is elementary to show that dc as c 2 see cd 1 because the integer d can be arbitarily large the holomorphic mapping a from the orem 1 can have an arbitrarily large number of components this fact has consequences for proper holomorphic mappings between balls in different dimensions for example in cd 1 theorem 1 is used to prove the following given a holomorphic polynomial q cn c that doesn t vanish on the closed unit ball there is an integer n and a holomorphic polynomial mapping p cn cn such that p q is reduced to lowest terms and defines a proper map between balls the integer n can be arbitarily large this is in sharp contrast to the case when n 1 where the result is trivial and we can take n 1 as well next we give an application to symbols of differential operators let d be a linear partial differential operator on real euclidean space r 2 n of even order 2 m recall see f for example that the principal symbol or characteristic form p of d governs whether it is elliptic we suppose that the principal symbol has constant coefficients thus p 2 m c and the operator is elliptic precisely when p vanishes only at the origin if we make the usual identification of r 2 n with cn then we can express d in terms of the operators zj and zj using multi index notation we can then write the principal symbol as 2 m c z z f z z in general f is not bihomogeneous there are simple simple necessary and sufficient condition for a real valued polynomial f z z to be bihomogeneous of degree 2 m one is that it be both homogeneous of degree 2 m over r and invariant under replacing z by ei z here ei is a scalar not an n tuple another is the existence of holomorphic polynomial mappings a and b each homogeneous of degreem such that f z z a z 2 b z 2 an arbitrary real valued polynomial p can be written as the difference of squared norms of holomorphic polynomials but the holomorphic polynomials will not be homogeneous of the same degree when p fails to be bihomogeneous see d for uses of such a decomposition we say that the partial differential operator d on r 2 n is complex bihomogeneous if its principal symbol is a bihomogeneous polynomial in this case we may apply theorem 1 to obtain the following conclusion we write for the laplace operator defined by zj zj theorem 2 let d be a complex bihomogeneous linear partial differential operator suppose that p is the absolute value of the principal symbol of d let qd be the absolute value of the principal symbol of dd the following are equivalent 1 d is elliptic that is p z z 0 for z 6 0 2 there is an integer d and a positive definite matrix e so that qd satisfies 7 qd z z m m e z z 3 there is an integer d so that qd is a squared norm of a holomorphic differential operator qd z z a z 2 i a i z 2 23 we assume also that the indicated homogeneous polynomials span vm d 4 there is an integer d so that qd satisfies 23 and such that v a 0 proof the principal symbol of dd evaluated at z z is qd z z z 2 dp z z the operator d is elliptic precisely when p is strictly positive away from the origin therefore by theorem 1 d is elliptic if and only there is d so that z 2 dp z z satisfies any of the equivalent conditions of proposition 1 equation 10 applied when r 1 is equivalent to the positive definiteness of e the strict holomorphic factorability there is equivalent to statement 3 here statement 3 obviously implies statement 4 which in turn implies that p z z is positive away from the origin thus the four statements are equivalent remark this result extends to systems of pde in a straightforward fashion v reinterpretation of theorem 1 next we reinterpret theorem 1 in terms of pullbacks of the universal bundle over grassman manifolds see w for more details about the universal bundle let gp n denote the grassman manifold of p planes in complex n space when p 1 we have complex projective space and we write as usual pn 1 for g 1 n let up n denote the universal bundle over gp n this bundle is sometimes known as the tautological bundle or the stupid bundle a point in up n is a pair s where s is a p dimensional subspace of cn and s we let g 0 denote the euclidean metric on up n in terms of a local frame e of up n we define g 0 e e e observe that if t determines a change of frames by acting on the right then g 0 et et et t e et t g 0 e t this is the correct transformation law and hence g 0 defines a hermitian metric on up n we may consider the matrix representation of g 0 with respect to a local frame we have g 0 ij ej ei where denotes the usual hermitian inner product on complex euclidean space cn and the vectors ei for i 1 r are linearly independent note the interchange of indices we see immediately that g 0 is of the form a a let l denote the universal line bundle l u u 1 n over complex projective space pn 1 we consider also its m th tensor power um let e denote the vector bundle over pn 1 equal to the direct sum of r copies of um on l we use the euclidean metric written z 2 and on e we use the metric determined by a matrix of bihomogeneous polynomials f z z that is positive definite for z 6 0 theorem 1 now admits the following restatement 8 theorem 3 suppose that l and e are the bundles over pn 1 as described in the previous paragraph equipped with the given metrics then there are integers n and d so that the bundle ld e over pn 1 with metric determined by z 2 df z z is the isometric pullback of the vector bundle ur n with the euclidean metric over the grassmanian gr n via a holomorphic embedding the link to bihomogeneous polynomials arises because one can identify homogeneous polynomials of degree m on cn with sections of the m th power hm of the hyperplane bundle h over pn 1 the bundle h is dual to u a matrix of bihomogeneous polynomials determines a metric on the direct sum of r copies of u the general result in cd 3 considers certain base manifoldsm a line bundle l and a vector bundle e over m and metrics r and f on them satisfying certain conditions the conclusion again guarantees the existence of integers n and d so that ld e with metric rdf is the isometric pullback of ur n with the euclidean metric over the grassmanian gr n the proof again relies on the bergman kernel and facts about compact operators but it is technically more difficult than the special case considered here vi remarks on classical factorization we briefly mention some of the results in dj and rr djokovic dj considers for example an r by r positive semi definite matrix f whose entries are complex valued homogeneous polynomials of degree 2 m in the pair of real variables he proves that one can write f a a where the entries in a are homogeneous polynomials of degree m two nice things about this result are that it is not required to multiply f by powers of a scalar function and f is allowed to be semi definite on the other hand the theorem holds only when the entries depend upon two real variables the analogue of one complex variable for us making a z depend holomorphically on z in 4 requires that we work with bihomogneous polynomials the only bihomogeneous polynomials in one complex variable are constants times z 2 m hence we could factor this scalar out of the matrix completely and the analogue of the result in dj becomes trivial in our setting the idea of multiplying by powers of a scalar factor does not appear in dj the work in rr concerns functions from either r or the unit circle s 1 that take values in non negative operators on a hilbert space the authors study many aspects of the factorization question in detail including holomorphic extension to the upper half plane or to the unit disc one of many results there is that if p x is a non negative operator on a hilbert space that is a polynomial of degree 2 m in the real variable x then there is an operator q x such that p x q x q x and such that q is a polynomial of degree m in x other results in rr are related to an application of theorem 1 here from cd 1 suppose that f z z is an arbitrary polynomial that is positive on the unit sphere then there is a holomorphic polynomial mapping g such that f z z g z 2 on the unit sphere in rr however positivity questions are considered only for functions depending on one variable references 9 cd 1 david w
