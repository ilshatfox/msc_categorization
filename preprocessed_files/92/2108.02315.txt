is unknown whether zombies from an evolutionary point of view can actually rise from the dead to provide insight into this unknown we created a mathematical model that predicts the trajectory of human and zombie populations during a zombie apocalypse we parameterized our model according to the demographics of the us the zombie literature and then conducted an evolutionary invasion analysis to determine conditions that permit the evolution of zombies our results indicate a zombie invasion is theoretically possible provided there is a sufficiently large ratio of transmission rate to the zombie death rate while achieving this ratio is uncommon in nature the existence of zombie ant fungus illustrates it is possible and thereby suggests that a zombie apocalypse among humans could occur keywords mathematical model stability analysis zombie apocalypse evolution invasion analysis 3 1 introduction the world is continuously at risk from pandemics with covid 19 sars and ebola serving as recent examples of their devastating impacts as time progresses diseases capable of starting another pandemic are more than likely to occur one important potential pandemic that would likely be worse than anything humanity has ever seen is a zombie apocalypse while this may seem far fetched for humanity in south america among other regions a fungus exists that can turn ants into zombie ants zombie ant 2021 which implies such an outbreak among humans is within the realm of biological possibilities what is biological possible constitutes all species most of which exhibit enormous diversity of traits coevolution of habitat diversity and species diversity 1995 nowak 2006 through examining these traits specifically the trade offs between them nowak 2006 the direction of evolution can be inferred which can provide a glimpse as to what may be in store for a species future typically such an evolution is caused by the occurrence of a rare mutant or a patient zero in the case of a novel disease mckay 2017 peters 2014 which features some form of trait advantage in reproductive ability size speed susceptibility to disease or survival rate among others while patient zero is ubiquitous in many pop culture movies and tv shows as the first individual to become a zombie wikipedia contributors 2021 the mechanism by which the first zombie is created is often relatively unknown classically many possible scenarios lead to the uprising of patient zero and ultimately a full blown zombie apocalypse for instance consumption of the mutated zombie ant fungi could infect humans causing them to seek out nutrients by cannibalism and thereby further spread fungal spores through their saliva the last of us n d alternatively medical experimentation is often a culprit in causing patient zero with cross transmission events from monkeys to humans boyle garland 2003 fresnadillo joffe 2007 and side effects of untested vaccines lawrence et al 2007 standing as common causes however despite these mechanisms for zombie uprisings it is unknown whether zombies from an evolutionary point of view can actually rise from the dead so to provide insight into this unknown we created a mathematical model that predicts the trajectory of human and zombie populations during a zombie apocalypse using this mathematical model we apply stability analysis martcheva 2015 to estimate the long term prognosis of the united states conduct an evolutionary invasion analysis otto day 2011 to infer conditions that allow the zombie apocalypse to occur or invade from another country and investigate the potential for an endless human zombie war through hopf bifurcation analysis our main findings show an uprising of zombies requires the fungus to transmit their spores to more than and would likely lead to an oscillating struggle that decreases over 0 023 thousands of years between humans and zombies as both try to overwhelm the other https paperpile com c zjpcja jtd 6 h https paperpile com c

that permit the evolution of zombies we developed a mathematical model of zombie transmission in a human population we calibrate our model to the demographics of the us and then apply stability evolutionary invasion and hopf bifurcation analyses to inform on the long term outcomes for humanity 2 1 mathematical model to begin we created a mathematical model that predicts the long term population of the us we then extend the model to include zombies and proceed to investigate the model s long term behavior 2 1 1 the resident system we first consider a resident system of humans split into two compartments one compartment represents the population of humans in the united states which is the population of susceptible humans and the second represents the number of deceased humans due to natural causes which have yet to completely decompose d the rates governing the transition between these compartments is given by 1 1 where is the birth rate is the mortality rate of people in the us during the year 2020 is the limiting capacity of humans in the us and is the rate at which dead bodies decompose table 1 parameters base values and sources constant parameter value citation transmission rate 0 35 per day pacheco j 2021 birth rate 0 000065753 per day united states 1968 mortality rate 0 00003562 per day united states 1968 decomposition rate of a human body 0 00595 per day

that tracks the number of humans that have been turned into zombies this compartment is governed by the differential equation 2 where is the zombie death rate and is the transmission rate of zombism 2 1 2 the extended system the extended system is a combination of the resident system and the zombie equation the equations are linked by including a transmission rate to capture the spread of zombism and a mortality rate that reflects patient zero naturally rising from the dead altogether this yields 1 3 note the transmission term is assumed to be a function of the death rate when 1 77 365 that 0 because natural death isn t transmittable 2 2 parameter estimation we estimated the population capacity from publically available data and determined the value of transmission rate based on the spread of zombie outbreaks from the literature pacheco j 2021 in addition we also obtained from the literature archyde 2021 2 2 1 population capacity to estimate the population capacity in the us we used a least squares method this method used the population of the us from 1960 1980 2000 and 2020 population total united states n d figure 1 using the average lifespan of a person within the us 79 years wamsley 2021 in conjunction with predictions of the us population from the resident model figure 2 through this procedure the value that had the least squares error was 558 075 379 https paperpile com

model from united states population the square error between the predictions of the resident model and us population data for the given value of population capacity figure 2 resident model vs us population the resident model with red 558 075 379 line and the us population from 1960 to 2020 black points 2 3 stability analysis here we apply stability analysis to the resident system to determine its long term behavior so we evaluated the jacobian at the non extinction and extinction equilibria to determine the long term behavior of the resident system as characterized by its eigenvalues 7 the jacobian of system 1 at the non extinction equilibrium and 1 is 1 which yields the eigenvalues of and thus the non extension 1 2 equilibrium is locally stable provided the death rate is lower than the birth rate for the extinction equilibrium and the jacobian of the system 1 simplifies to 0 0 the associated eigenvalues are and the extinction equilibrium is thus 1 2 locally stable when the death rate is greater than the birth rate 2 4 analysis of zombie invasion and evolution to determine whether zombies could evolve and become the dominant form of death we extend the resident model to include a zombie class we then provide details of the jacobian of the extended model to illustrate conditions that permit zombies to invade a population and their potential evolution from the dead 2 4 1 conditions for a zombie invasion for the extended system 3 when and 0 the jacobian at and is 0 1 1 0 thus given it follow that zombies cannot invade provide 1 0 2 0 3 1 0 2 4 2 conditions that prevent the zombie uprising to examine the potential uprising of patient zero we now consider the jacobian of the extended system for close but not equal to zero specifically the jacobian evaluated at and is 1 1 0 8 it follows that the eigenvalues are 1 2 12 1 1 2 2 1 2 3 12 1 1 2 2 1 2 thus for the zombie free equilibrium to be an evolutionarily stable state otto day 2011 we require 2 2 where and 1 77 365 0 for values of close to we have that 0 2 2 0 2 0 0 where and 2 0 2 0 0 1 therefore for close to the zombie free equilibrium is an evolutionarily stable state provided 0 2 0 0 0 0 and 2 2 2 0 0 2 5 periodic behavior https paperpile com c zjpcja 59 nh 9 we now examine the potential for periodic behavior in the dynamics between humans and zombies by means of hopf bifurcation analysis to begin we assume thus the extended system has the non extinction and zombie 0 endemic equilibria 2 rearranging the order of the system computing the jacobian and evaluating it at the non extinction and zombie endemic equilibrium we have that it follows that the eigenvalues of are and 1 2 3 12 2 4 for periodic behavior to occur we require purely imaginary eigenvalues and so if 0 then which implies periodic behavior does not occur if then 0 2 3 0 0 2 3 thus for and periodic behavior does not occur 0 0 3 results to illustrate our predictions on the likelihood of a zombie apocalypse and its effect on human populations we parameterized our model according to the demographics of the us and the zombie literature furthermore to illustrate the potential outcomes for humanity and zombies we evaluate the trajectory of our model for and and 0 015 0 029 0 35 determined the long term behavior of the model through stability evolutionary invasion analysis and hopf bifurcation analyses in the absence of zombies the us population converges towards maximum capacity as nothing is hindering their growth when zombies are included the behavior of the system depends critically on the values of and for instance given the value of must be greater 0 than 0 023 for zombies to disrupt the stability of the non extinction equilibrium figure 5 similarly when it is required that for zombies to be able to disrupt the 0 35 0 1575 stability of the non extinction equilibrium figure 4 10 the phases of the extended model show the pattern the outbreak could take depending on how fast or slow zombies spread figure 7 for the zombie apocalypse to occur the value must be greater than 0 023 a value of less than 0 023 causes the non extinction and zombie endemic equilibrium to be unstable for example with a low value of such as 0 015 the zombies die out and the humans converge to their carrying capacity k figure 6 a d g when is slightly above 0 023 for example 0 029 the system approaches a non extinction and zombie endemic equilibrium implying zombie and human populations end up coexisting figure 6 b e h for higher values of such as 0 35 shows more frequent decreasing oscillations between human and zombie populations implying both populations will battle it out for dominance figures 6 c f i and figure 7 to determine if the current form of death is an evolutionarily stable state we examine the largest eigenvalue when figure 4 specifically for we have that 2 0 figure 4 this means that natural death without zombies is the 2 2 dominant form of death for humans which implies that zombies cannot evolve from the dead figure 4 the change in the real part of the eigenvalues of the extended system with respect too the blue line with circles is the eigenvalue while the red line with triangles and black line represents the real parts of the eigenvalues respectively when 0 for any 2 3 eigenvalue a zombie outbreak can occur 11 figure 5 the change in eigenvalues of the extended system with respect to the value of is shown by the blue line with circles the real part is represented by the red line with 1 triangles and black lines respectively the critical point on this graph is where is greater than 2 0 which occurs when values of result in a zombie outbreak 0 023 12 a b c d e f g h i figure 6 3 the trajectory of the extended model from left to right the columns have values of 0 015 0 029 and 0 35 the first column shows what happens when the zombie population dies off after initial infection as the us human population continues to grow towards k the second column resulted in an endemic equilibrium where each population never reaches k but it never falls to 0 this leads to both species eventually coexisting with one another the third column is much more chaotic as both populations rise and dip over the years showing a constant struggle for survival 13 14 figure 7 phase portraits of the extended model the left middle and right columns have values of 0 015 0 029 and 0 35 respectively the top and bottom rows correspond to plots of zombies vs humans and deaths vs zombies respectively 4 discussion we analyzed a mathematical model using stability evolutionary invasion and hopf bifurcation analyses to determine the long term prognosis of the united states and the likelihood of a potential zombie uprising according to our model the prognosis of the united states remains positive so long as its birth rate continues to exceed its mortality rate and no country imports any form of zombie infection importantly our evolutionary invasion analysis shows that an invasion is likely only possible if the ratio of the zombie transmission rate to the zombie death rate is less than the ratio of alive humans to alive and non decayed dead humans unfortunately if zombies can invade the united states our stability analysis shows that we would likely have to learn to coexist with zombies at least until some form of public health intervention is implemented to eradicate them according to our results zombie invasions are theoretically possible provided a sufficiently large ratio of transmission rate to the zombie death rate while achieving this ratio is uncommon in nature a single ant infected with zombie ant fungus can potentially infect entire colonies by seeking elevated locations that promote transmission in tropical climates such as brazil africa and thailand zombie ants real world sci fi horror story 2020 if a human zombie https paperpile com c zjpcja u 5 zf 1 15 followed such behavior this suggests they would seek out a more densely populated area which would increase the chances of people being infected while our work focused on showing the theoretical conditions required for zombies to evolve or invade the united states there exist many potential future directions for instance we could calibrate our model to the transmission cycle of zombie ant fungus and ants to inform the dynamics of zombie evolution furthermore we could also generalize our model to account for additional traits such as zombie speed or intelligence or additional zombification stages such as latent or asymptomatic infection to gauge their effects on the likelihood of an uprising as with all mathematical models our work has several limitations to begin there is a lack of available and reliable data on zombie outbreaks and our analysis hinged on the functional form of the human mortality rate furthermore research studies on zombie evolution are limited although recent trends in studying zombie ant fungus are on the rise whyevolutionistrue 2020 zimmer 2019 other important factors from our work include simplifying assumptions on the demographics of zombies and humans alike specifically people with underlying health conditions disabled people the elderly and the young would likely be at high risk of becoming zombies which could stand to influence the speed that zombism transmits and its capacity for invasion having stated this the likely advances in science and public health from a zombie outbreak would help to offset such health inequalities in addition to improving humanity s ability to combat epidemics and eradicate zombies even though zombie ants exist our main finding indicates human zombies are impossible from an evolutionary standpoint furthermore upon a situation where human zombies do rise our work further highlights that the us would likely survive either by promoting conditions that discourage a zombie invasion or by learning to coexist with zombies in some form of steady state at least until the time that medicine or some massive public health intervention turns the tide in humanities favor https paperpile com c zjpcja jzsjq https paperpile com c zjpcja msimc 16 references adams v 2017 dying what happens to the body
