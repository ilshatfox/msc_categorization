present an open source package with the latest release of ebic a next generation biclustering algorithm for mining genetic data the major contribution of this paper is adding full multi gpu support which makes it possible to run efficiently large genomic data mining analyses multiple enhancements to the first release of the algorithm include integration with r and bioconductor and an option to exclude missing values from analysis results ebic was applied to datasets of different sizes including a large dna methylation dataset with 436 444 rows for the largest dataset we observed over 6 6 fold speedup in computation time on a cluster of 8 gpus compared to running the method on a single gpu this proves high scalability of the method availability the latest version of ebic could be downloadedfromhttp github com epistasislab ebic installation and usage instructions are also available online contact patryk orzechowski gmail com jhmoore upenn edu supplementary information supplementary informations are available online 1 introduction biclustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique which attempts to detect meaningful data patterns that are distributed across different columns and rows of the input dataset this allows biclustering to capture heterogeneous patterns that manifest only in subsets of genes and subsets of samples biclustering has been commonly applied to genomic datasets padilha and campello 2017 and has proven to be successful in revealing potential diagnostic biomarkers liu et al 2018 or tumor transcription profiles in breast cancer singh et al 2018 with exponentially increasing sizes of the input datasets there is an emerging need for effective and efficient methods that would scale well with growing amounts of data although there was discussion on possibility of applying biclustering to larger datasets kasim et al 2016 padilha and campello 2017 hardly any biclustering study involved large genomic dataset this motivated emergence of parallel biclustering method some of the most recent parallel methods use multiple threads e g runibic orzechowski et al 2017 or message passing interface mpi e g parbibit gonz lez dom nguez and exp sito 2018 or gpu e g ccs bhattacharya and cui 2017 orzechowski et al 2018 one of the recent advancements in biclustering area was introduction of ebic a parallel biclustering method which takes advantage of multiple evolutionary computation strategies orzechowski et al 2018 this representative of hybrid biclustering algorithms orzechowski and boryczko 2016 a c b has been shown to outperform multiple state of the art methods in terms of accuracy although the original concept of ebic provided theoretical support for multiple gpus all the previous evaluations have been made using a single gpu thus the rationale of involving multiple gpus was not clear another constraint for ebic was hardware limitation of the size of the dataset to 65 535 rows per gpu this required large clusters of gpus in order to run analyses and greatly restricted application of the method in this paper we introduce the open source package built on top of the upgraded version of the method first and foremost a full support for multi gpus is added which allows to analyze datasets with almost unlimited numbers of rows available memory is a constraint secondly the method has been integrated with bioconductor which enables the user to run all the analysis from the r level thirdly a different method for performing analysis was added which depends on the presence or absence of missing values within the data last but not least some bugs have been fixed and optimizations were made for more efficient memory management all above combined make an this open source software ready out of the box for big data biclustering analysis http arxiv org abs 1807 09932 v 1 http github com epistasislab ebic patryk orzechowski gmail com jhmoore upenn edu main 2018 7 27 0 28 page 2 2 2 orzechowski et al 2 methods the new version of ebic provides a comprehensive open source framework for performing biclustering analysis the major improvements over the original release of the method include support for big data in the previous version of ebic only a very limited number of rows could be processed on a single gpu kernel grid constrained the maximal number of rows analyzable by a ebic to 65 535 per gpu thus at least 8 gpus were needed to analyze large datasets e g modern methylation datasets our new implementation overcomes this limitation allowing to analyze up to 231 1 rows per single gpu devices with computing capabilities 3 0 this greatly enhances the flexibility and applicability of the method to almost any type of data this comes at a cost of reducing the size of genetic algorithm population down to 65 535 this remains a large number as for the majority of genomic datasets the algorithm converged using a population size of 1 600 or less individuals handling missing values we introduce a very important feature which allows to remove the impact of missing values on the results of the method as ebic search is driven by counting of rows a greater or equal relation between the values in columns used to capture missing values instead of the real trends in the data this posed a drawback especially for datasets with high percentage of missing values instead of finding useful patterns in the data ebic used to become more attracted in detecting the emptiness in the current release missing values might be replaced with a predefined value e g 0 or 999 which is no longer counted towards the score of the bicluster thus the method is focused on the real trends in the data instead of emptiness different input file formats support ebic allows different delimiters in input file the data values might be separated by either comma tabulator or semicolon an upper left header is not required which simplifies porting files between ebic and r compatibility with r and bioconductor the results returned by ebic could be easily saved into a format loadable by bioconductor r package biclust in order to perform biological validation in supplementary material we provide detailed workflow presenting how to use ebic all within r environment workflow for analysis of methylation data ebic was capable to capture bio meaningful signals in methylation data a tutorial is presented in a supplementary material 3 results in order to assess running times of the algorithm we have performed tests on from 1 up to 8 gpus on datasets with varying number of rows and columns the geo accession

present the recent advancements in one of the leading biclustering methods the algorithm was wrapped into a framework which is conveniently integrated with r and allows multiple input file formats in supplementary material we also demonstrate that even for such a large genomic dataset the results provided by ebic are bio meaningful we conclude that ebic released as open source package is a very
