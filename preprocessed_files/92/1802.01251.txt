intrinsic structure of neural codes were introduced by c curto et al in 2013 since then they were investigated in several papers including the 2017 paper by gu ntu rku n et al in which the notion of polarization of neural ideals was introduced in this paper we extend their ideas by introducing the notions of polarization of motifs and neural codes we show that the notions that we introduced have very nice properties which could allow the studying of the intrinsic structure of neural codes of length n via the square free monomial ideals in 2 n variables and interpreting the results back in the original neural code ambient space in the last section of the paper we introduce the notions of inactive neurons partial neural codes and partial motifs as well as the notions of polarization of these codes and motifs we use these notions to give a new proof of a theorem from the paper by gu ntu rku n et al that we mentioned above 1 introduction the neural rings and ideals as an algebraic tool for analyzing the intrinsic structure of neural codes were introduced by c curto et al in 2013 in the pioneering paper 3 in order to make our paper self contained we will give in this section all the definitions and facts from 3 that we are going to use which are related to neural codes all other notions and facts that we assume are well known can be found either in 3 or in the standard references 1 and 2 definition and basic facts 1 1 3 an element w w 1 wn of f n 2 is called a word of length n a set c fn 2 is called a neural code shortly code of length n we also call the subsets of fn 2

christensen and hamid kulosman is denoted by cc we denote m 0 1 we say that this set is the set of motifs of length 1 we define a partial order on m by declaring that 0 and 1 a sequence a a 1 an mn is called a motif of length n we define a partial order on the set mn by declaring that a b if ai bi for every i n in other words a b if for each i n bi 0 resp 1 implies ai 0 resp 1 we have a b va vb for a mn the subset va of fn 2 consisiting of all the words w obtained by replacing the stars of a by elements of f 2 is called the variety of a for a code c fn 2 a motif a of length n is called a motif of c if va c the set of all motifs of c is denoted by mot c a motif a mot c is called a maximal motif of c if for any motif b mot c a b implies a b the set of all maximal motifs of c is denoted by maxmot c for any a mot c there is a b maxmot c such that a b we have c if and only if maxmot c moreover for any two codes c 1 and c 2 c 1 c 2 maxmot c 1 maxmot c 2 remark 1 2 3 pages 1593 and 1594 we have c va a maxmot c however it can happen that for a proper subset m of maxmot c we still have c va a m for example consider the neural code c 000 001 011 111 f 32 then maxmot c 00 0 1 11 however c v 00 v 11 definition 1 3 2 3 for a variety v fn 2 we define the ideal of v i v f 2 x 1 xn in the following way i v f f 2 x 1 xn f w 0 for all w v note that for any variety v in fn 2 we have i v b where b x 21 x 1 x 2 n xn is the boolean ideal of f 2 x 1 xn moreover for v fn 2 we have i v b if and only if v fn 2 for an ideal i f 2 x 1 xn we define the variety of i v i fn 2 in the following way v i w fn 2 f w 0 for all f i theorem 1 4 3 4 for every variety v fn 2 we have v i v v polarization of neural codes 3 for every ideal i f 2 x 1 xn we have i v i i i b the second formula in the previous theorem is called the hilbert s nullstellensatz for f 2 definition 1 5 3 4 for a motif a mn we define the lagrange polynomial of a la f 2 x 1 xn in the following way la ai 1 xi aj 0 1 xj note that for any word w fn 2 la w 1 if and only if w va i e la w 0 if and only if w va definition 1 6 3 page 1582 for a neural code c fn 2 we define the neural ideal of c jc f 2 x 1 xn in the following way jc lw w cc proposition 1 7 3 lemma 3 2 for a neural code c fn 2 we have v jc c i c jc b definition 1 8 3 page 1585 a polynomial f f 2 x 1 xn is called a pseudo monomial if it has the form f i xi j 1 xj for some n 1 n with an ideal i f 2 x 1 xn is called a pseudo monomial ideal if i can be generated by a finite set of pseudo monomials definition 1 9 3 page 1585 let i be an ideal in f 2 x 1 xn and f i a pseudo monomial we say that f is a minimal pseudo monomial of i if there does not exist another pseudo monomial g i such that deg g deg f and g f in f 2 x 1 xn definition 1 10 3 page 1585 let i be a pseudo monomial ideal in f 2 x 1 xn we call the finite set cf i consisting of all minimal pseudo monomials of i the canonical form of i remark 1 11 3 page 1585 clearly for any pseudo monomial ideal i of f 2 x 1 xn cf i is unique and i cf i on the other hand cf i is not necessarily a minimal generating set of i for example consider the ideal i x 1 1 x 2 x 2 1 x 3 this ideal contains a third minimal pseudo monomial x 1 1 x 3 1 x 3 4 katie christensen and hamid kulosman x 1 1 x 2 x 1 x 2 1 x 3 so that cf i x 1 1 x 2 x 2 1 x 3 x 1 1 x 3 which is not a minimal generating set of i proposition 1 12 3 proposition 4 5 let c fn 2 be a code in fn 2 and d its complement let maxmot c a 1 al then maxmot d b b 1 bn bi 6 aj bi aji and aj 6 bi 6 bi aji and b is maximal with respect to these two properties in particular if maxmot c then maxmot d proof the proposition follows from proposition 4 5 and corollary 5 5 from 3 proposition 1 13 3 lemma 5 7 let c fn 2 be a neural code and jc the neural ideal of c then cf jc la a maxmot cc remark 1 14 3 page 1594 note that it can happen that jc la a m where m is a proper subset of maxmot cc for example for the neural code c 000 001 011 111 f 32 we have cc 100 010 110 101 so that maxmot cc 10 10 1 0 hence cf jc l 10 l 10 l 1 0 however jc l 10 l 10 definition 1 15 3 page 1594 for a motif a 0 1 n we define a prime ideal of a pa f 2 x 1 xn in the following way pa xi ai 0 1 xj aj 1 if a prime ideal p in f 2 x 1 xn is equal to pa for some motif a we say that p is a motivic prime ideal proposition 1 16 3 page 1594 let a b 0 1 n be two motifs of length n we have va vb pb pa i va pa b v pa va for an ideal i in f 2 x 1 xn we denote by min i the set of all minimal prime ideals of i polarization of neural codes 5 proposition 1 17 3 lemma 5 1 lemma 5 3 and corollary 5 5 let c fn 2 be a neural code and a mn a motif we have a mot c pa jc a maxmot c pa min jc moreover 1 min jc pa a maxmot c proposition 1 18 3 corollary 5 5 let c fn 2 be a non empty neural code then jc pa a maxmot c is the unique irredundant primary decomposition of jc the notions of polarization of pseudo monomials and pseudo monomial ideals were introduced in 2017 in the paper 5 by gu ntu rku n et al definition 1 19 5 page 6 for a pseudo monomial f i xi j 1 xj f 2 x 1 xn where are two disjoint subsets of n we define its polarization f p to be the square free monomial f p i xi j yj f 2 x 1 xn y 1 yn proposition 1 20 5 lemma 3 1 let f g f 2 x 1 xn be two pseudomonomials then f g f p gp definition 1 21 5 definition 3 3 let j be a pseudo monomial ideal in f 2 x 1 xn and let cf j f 1 fl be its canonical form we define the polarization of j to be the ideal jp f p 1 f p l f 2 x 1 xn y 1 yn note that then cf jp f p 1 f p l remark 1 22 about definitions and notation related to f 2 n 2 vs those related to fn 2 square free monomial ideals are the ideals generated by square free monomials and they are easier to deal with than the pseudo monomial ideals the previous two definitions show that in order to get some conclusions about the pseudo monomial ideals in n variables x 1 xn we can consider some related square free monomial ideals 6 katie christensen and hamid kulosman in 2 n variables which however are not denoted by x 1 x 2 n but by x 1 xn y 1 yn because of this difference in the notation for variables we should be aware that for example a pseudomonomial in f 2 x 1 xn y 1 yn is a polynomial of the form f i xi j 1 xj k yk l 1 yl where n similarly we have for example that for a motif a b 1 bn c 1 cn mot 2 n the lagrange polynomial la of a and the prime ideal pa of a are respectively given in the following way 2 la ai 1 xi aj 0 1 xj bi 1 yi bj 0 1 yj 3 pa xi bi 0 1 xj bj 1 yi ci 0 1 yj cj 1 so the definitions of these notions with respect to f 2 n 2 are the same as the ones with respect to fn 2 we just need to take into account the notation for the variables this works for other notions as well like for example minimal pseudo monomials in an ideal the neural ideal of a code the canonical form of a pseudo monomial ideal etc while some notions like for example minimal primes of an ideal etc can be given in the form that does not depend on the notation for the variables from now on we have the following convention if the length of motifs and codes is denoted by n then the associated rings and ideals will always be in n variables x 1 xn while for the length denoted by 2 n the associated rings and ideals will always be in 2 n variables x 1 xn y 1 yn for lengths given by concrete numbers it will always be clear from the context if the number is n or 2 n 2 definitions of the polarizations of motifs and codes we would like to define the motif ap which is the polarization of a motif a a 1 an mn since for the motifs from mn we have that the lagrange polynomials and the prime ideals of motifs are in n variables and the polarizations of those lagrange polynomials and prime ideals of motifs are in 2 n variables it is natural to try to define ap to be an element of m 2 n after defining the polarization of the motifs we would define the polarization of a neural code c fn 2 in the following way cp vap a maxmot c f 2 n 2 polarization of neural codes 7 this would imply that 4 maxmotp c maxmot cp here and in the rest of the paper we use the notation mp ap a m for any m mn we would also like that the formula 5 min jcp min p jc holds we will first try to find the formula for ap in an example so we will assume that the relations 4 and 5 hold in addition to that we will be using the relation 1 min jc pa a maxmot c example 2 1 suppose that the relations 1 4 and 5 hold let c 10 f 22 then maxmot c 10 by 5 we have maxmot cp 10 p by 1 min jc 1 x 1 x 2 p 10 hence by 5 min jcp 1 x 1 x 2 p x 2 y 1 p 00 hence by 1 maxmot cp 00 maxmotp c 10 p thus 6 10 p 00 now d cc 00 01 11 so that maxmot d 0 1 hence by 4 maxmot dp 0 p 1 p by 1 min jd x 1 1 x 2 hence by 5 min jdp x 1 1 x 2 p x 1 y 2 p 0 p 0 hence by 1 maxmot dp 0 0 maxmotp d 0 p 1 p 8 katie christensen and hamid kulosman hence we have either 7 0 p 0 1 p 0 or 8 1 p 0 0 p 0 now if we have a 1 a 2 p b 1 b 2 c 1 c 2 then the formula 6 would suggest that a 1 1 b 1 c 1 0 a 2 0 b 2 0 c 2 and the formula 7 would suggest that a 1 0 b 1 0 c 1 a 2 b 2 c 2 this would suggest that if a 1 an p b 1 bn c 1 cn then ai 0 bi 0 ci ai 1 bi ci 0 ai bi ci this in particular suggests that the formulas 7 are the correct way to polarize and not the formulas 8 having completed this example based on the reasoning in it we introduce the following definition definition 2 2 let a a 1 an mn we define its polarization a p b 1 bn c 1 cn in the following way if ai 0 in a then bi 0 ci in ap if ai 1 in a then bi ci 0 in ap if ai in a then bi ci in ap polarization of neural codes 9 schematically 0 7 0 1 7 0 9 7 we now define the polarization of a code definition 2 3 for any code c fn 2 we define its polarization cp f 2 n 2 in the following way cp vap a maxmot c example 2 4 let s now determine cp and dp for c and d cc from example 2 1 cp 10 p v 10 p v 00 0000 1000 0001 1001 dp 00 01 11 p v 0 p v 1 p v 0 v 0 0000 0100 0010 0110 0001 0101 0011 0111 1000 1100 1010 1110 note that here cp dp 0000 and cp dp f 42 1111 in general cp dp can contain several words and the complement of cp dp in f 2 n 2 can as well contain several words definition 2 5 we say that a motif b m 2 n is a polar motif if there is a motif a mn such that b ap the motif a is unique and we then denote a bd note that we have a pd a for every a mn b dp b for every polar motif b m 2 n 3 properties of the polarization of motifs and codes proposition 3 1 let a b mn then a b ap bp 10 katie christensen and hamid kulosman proof suppose a b let i n if bp i 0 then bp n i and bi 0 hence ai 0 hence a p i 0 if b p n i 0 then b p i and bi 1 hence ai 1 hence a p n i 0 thus a p bp suppose ap bp let i n if bi 0 then bp i 0 hence ap i 0 hence ai 0 if bi 1 then b p n i 0 hence a p n i 0 hence ai 1 thus a b corollary 3 2 for any code c fn 2 we have motp c mot cp proof let a mot c and let b maxmot c such that a b by proposition 3 1 ap bp since by the definition of cp bp mot cp we have ap mot cp theorem 3 3 for any code c fn 2 we have maxmot cp maxmotp c proof claim 1 maxmot cp 0 2 n proof of claim 1 suppose to the contrary i e that b maxmot cp has a component b 1 for some 2 n let w vb then w 1 we have w vap for some a maxmot c then ap hence the word w obtained by replacing w in w by 0 is also in vap hence in c hence the motif b obtained by replacing b by is also a motif of cp contradicting to the maximality of b claim 1 is proved claim 2 let b maxmot cp then there is no i n such that bi bn i 0 proof of claim 2 suppose to the contrary let a j n bj bn j b j n bj 0 bn j c j n bj bn j 0 d j n bj bn j 0 then the sets a b c d form a partition of n and i d let w vb be defined in the following way j a wj wn j 1 j b wj 0 wn j 1 j c wj 1 wn j 0 j d wj wn j 0 polarization of neural codes 11 since w cp there is an a maxmot c such that w vap since ap is a polar motif we have j a ap j ap n j j b ap j 0 or ap n j j c ap j ap n j 0 or j d at least one of ap j ap n j is the other one is 0 or since d contains at least one element these relations imply ap b contradicting to the maximality of b claim 2 is proved claim 3 maxmot cp maxmotp c proof of claim 3 let b maxmot cp by the claims 1 and 2 for each i n we have one the following three cases bi bn i or bi 0 bn i or bi bn i 0 let w vb be a word defined in the following way if bi bn i then wi wn i 1 if bi 0 and bn i then wi 0 wn i 1 if bi and bn i 0 then wi 1 wn i 0 this word belongs to some vap where a maxmot c since ap is a polar motif we have the following cases when wi wn i 1 then a p i a p n i when wi 0 and wn i 1 then ap i 0 a p n i when wi 1 and wn i 0 then ap i ap n i 0 hence a p b since ap mot c and b maxmot c we have b ap claim 3 is proved claim 4 maxmotp c maxmot cp proof of claim 4 suppose to the contrary let a maxmot c such that ap maxmot cp by the definition of cp ap mot cp hence there is a b maxmot cp such that ap b by claim 3 b cp for some c maxmot c now by proposition 3 1 from ap cp we get a c which is a contradiction since both a and c are maximal motifs of c claim 4 is proved now the statement of the theorem follows from claim 3 and claim 4 definition 3 4 for a motif a a 1 an mn we define a to be the motif b b 1 bn mn which satisfies the following condition for i 1 2 n if ai 6 then bi ai 1 ai example 3 5 1 01 0 10 note that for two motifs a b mn we have 10 b ap a bd 12 katie christensen and hamid kulosman also if for any code c fn 2 and any m mot c we denote m a a m then mot c mot c 11 maxmot c maxmot c 12 proposition 3 6 for any motif a mn we have lp a l a p proof this follows from the definitions 1 19 2 2 2 and 3 4 example 3 7 let n 4 and let a 11 0 mot 4 then la x 1 x 2 1 x 4 hence lp a x 1 x 2 y 4 on the other side we have ap 11 0 p 00 11 p 00 0 0 11 1 hence l a p x 1 x 2 y 4 l p a definition 3 8 we say that two motifs a b mn are disjoint if there is an i n such that ai bi definition 3 9 on the set m of motifs of length 1 we introduce a commutative operation of addition in the following way 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 the first three lines represent the arithmetic in the field f 2 while the last three lines represent the max arithmetic we then the addition in m n by adding two motifs componentwise polarization of neural codes 13 it is easy to verify that with this operation and the partial order that we introduced before mn is a partially ordered monoid the importance of above definition lies in the fact that the sum a b of two motifs a b mn has an 1 component if and only if the motifs a and b are disjoint thus we can recognize the disjointness of two motifs algebraically by considering their sum proposition 3 10 let a mot c for some code c fn 2 and b mn then b mot cc if and only if b is disjoint with a moreover the maximal motifs of cc are the motifs b that are maximal among the motifs from mn that are disjoint with all the maximal motifs of c proof easy to see proposition 3 11 let a b b mn if a b has an 1 component and b b then a b has an 1 component in particular if c is a code in mn the maximal motifs of cc are the maximal elements b mn such that each a b a maxmot c has an 1 component proof easy to see corollary 3 12 let c fn 2 be a code in fn 2 if b maxmot c cp then every bi which is different than is equal to 1 proof the statement follows from the previous proposition as each 0 could be replaced by a which would result in a strictly bigger motif disjoint with all maximal motifs of cp proposition 3 13 the motifs a and b from mn are disjoint if and only if the motifs ap and b p from m 2 n are disjoint proof suppose that a and b are disjoint we first consider the case ai 1 bi 0 for some i n then ap i and ap n i 0 while b p i and b p n i 1 hence a p and b p are disjoint the case ai 0 bi 1 for some i n is similar suppose that ap and bp are disjoint we first consider the case ap i 0 b p i 1 for some i n then ai 0 and b p i 0 hence b i 0 hence bi 1 so that a and b are disjoint the case ap i 1 b p i 0 for some i n is similar proposition 3 14 let c d be two codes in fn 2 then d cc dp c cp 14 katie christensen and hamid kulosman proof the next equivalences follow from proposition 3 10 proposition 3 13 theorem 3 3 and proposition 3 10 respectively d cc a maxmot c b maxmot d a and b are disjoint a maxmot c b maxmot d ap and bp are disjoint c maxmot cp d maxmot dp c and d are disjoint dp c cp remark 3 15 note that in the previous proposition the equality on the left hand side is not equivalent with the equality on the right hand side as we are going to see in example 3 20 corollary 3 16 let d cc then cp c dp proof follows immediately from the previous proposition the reason for giving the next definition and using the terminolo gy introduced in it will become clear later after theorem 3 19 and example 3 20 definition 3 17 let c be a code in fn 2 and let d be its complement we call the code c p defined by 13 c p c dp the formal polarization of the code c proposition 3 18 let c be a code in fn 2 and d its complement we have maxmot cp maxmot c p 14 maxmot c c p maxmot d p maxmot c cp 15 proof by theorem 3 3 and the formula 13 this is equivalent with showing that a maxmot c b maxmot d ap and bp are disjoint which is true by proposition 3 13 we now show 15 let d maxmot c c p maxmot dp then d b p for some b maxmot d let e maxmot c cp such that d e i e bp e hence bp e since e is bigger than or equal to a polar motif e is a polar motif too so e f p for some motif f polarization of neural codes 15 hence b p fp so that bp f p e hence since e is disjoint with all the maximal motifs of cp then by proposition 3 13 f is disjoint with all the maximal motifs of c and f b where b is one of the maximal motifs among the motifs that are disjoint with all maximal motifs of c hence f b so that d e theorem 3 19 let c be a code in fn 2 we have cf j p c cf p jc cf jc p cf jcp proof let cf jc f 1 fk by definition jpc f p 1 f p k here f p 1 f p k are square free monomials by 6 corrolary 1 10 the set f p 1 f p k contains a minimal susbest s with respect to inclusion which generates j p c by 6 corrolary 1 8 if f p i s then f p i f p j for some f p j s then by proposition 1 20 fi fj a contradiction thus s f p 1 f p k hence by 6 proposition 1 11 cf jp c f p 1 f p k cf p jc let d be the complement of c we have cf p jc lpa a maxmot d by proposition 1 13 l a p a maxmot d by proposition 3 6 lb b d maxmot d by 10 lb b d maxmot d lb b maxmot d p lb b maxmot d p cf j c p by proposition 1 13 finally the inclusion in the statement of the theorem follows from proposition 3 18 and proposition 1 13 example 3 20 consider the neural codes c 000 100 110 011 and d c c 001 010 101 111 in f 32 we have maxmot c 00 1 0 011 and maxmot dc 01 1 1 111 then by theorem 3 3 maxmot cp 00 00 0 00 16 maxmot dp 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 17 16 katie christensen and hamid kulosman by proposition 3 14 we have dp c cp from 17 we have by proposition 1 13 cf jc p x 3 y 2 x 1 x 3 x 2 y 1 y 3 cf p jc by proposition 3 10 a motif b m 6 is a maximal motif of c cp if and only if it is a maximal motif from m 6 disjoint with all the maximal motifs of cp the sets a 1 2 3 a 2 3 4 a 3 1 5 6 are the sets of coordinates which the maximal motifs a 1 00 a 2 00 and a 3 0 00 of cp have zeros at respectively to get a set b of coordinates where a motif b maxmot c cp has ones we need to take one element from each of the sets a 1 a 2 a 3 and then out of all sets b obtained in that way 2 2 3 12 of them select the minimal ones with respect to inclusion in that way we get the sets b 1 2 4 1 b 2 2 4 5 b 3 2 4 6 b 4 3 1 b 5 3 5 and b 6 3 6 for each of these sets bi we get an element bi maxmot c cp by putting ones at all the coordinates of bi and stars at all other coordinates thus maxmot c cp 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 11 11 1 hence by proposition 1 13 cf jcp x 3 y 2 x 1 x 3 x 2 y 1 y 3 x 3 y 3 x 2 y 1 y 2 x 1 x 2 y 1 in particular cp c p one can check that cp has 29 words while c p has 35 words example 3 21 consider again the code c 10 fn 2 and its com plement d 00 01 11 from examples 2 1 and 2 4 we have maxmot c 10 maxmot d 0 1 cf jc 1 x 1 x 2 cf j c p cf p jc x 2 y 1 cp 0000 1000 0001 1001 maxmot c cp 1 1 cf jcp x 2 y 1 thus in this example cp c p polarization of neural codes 17 definition 3 22 the prime ideals p f 2 x 1 xn y 1 yn such that p pap for some a mn are called polar motivic primes for polar motivic primes we have the following formula 18 pap p p a indeed if a a 1 an maxmot c and ap b 1 bnc 1 cn then pap xi bi 0 yj cj 0 xi ai 0 yj aj 1 pp a theorem 3 23 for any code c fn 2 we have min jcp min p jc min jc p proof we have min jcp pd d maxmot cp by proposition 1 17 pap a maxmot c by theorem 3 3 pap pa min jc by proposition 1 17 pp a pa min jc by the formula 18 hence min jcp min p jc the inclusion part of the statement follows from 14 and the relation 1 from proposition 1 17 example 3 24 we continue example 3 20 by 17 we have maxmot c c p 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 now using the same technique as in example 3 20 for finding maxmot c cp given maxmot cp we find here that maxmot c p 00 00 0 0 00 0 0 00 0 00 hence by proposition 1 17 we have min jcp x 2 x 3 x 3 y 1 x 1 y 2 y 3 minp jc min j c p x 2 x 3 x 3 y 1 x 1 y 2 y 3 x 3 y 3 x 1 x 2 y 2 x 1 y 1 y 2 the minimal prime ideals of j p c i e j c p were also calculated in 5 example 5 4 in a different way note that among the minimal primes of j c p we have in addition to all the minimal primes of jcp three non polar minimal primes namely 18 katie christensen and hamid kulosman p 0 0 x 3 y 3 p 00 0 x 1 x 2 y 2 and p 0 00 x 1 y 1 y 2 a natural question to ask is the following one if for an a m 2 n we have pa min jc p how is then the motif a related to c a statement related to this question is given in the next section in theorem 4 5 which is 5 theorem 5 1 we will give a different proof of this theorem theorem 3 25 for any code c fn 2 the ideal jcp has the unique irredundant primary decomposition and it is obtained by polarizing the prime ideals from the unique irredundant primary decomposition of jc proof by 3 corollary 5 5 the ideals jc and jcp have the unique irredundant primary decompositions jc pa a maxmot c jc pb b maxmot cp hence the statement follows from theorem 3 3 and the formula 18 4 partial motifs definition 4 1 we denote pm 0 1 we say that this set is the set of partial motifs of length 1 we define a partial order on pm by declaring that 0 and 1 note that is comparable only with itself the same holds for 0 and 1 we define a partial order on the set pmn by declaring that a b if ai bi for every i n a partial motif of length n is an element of pmn a partial word of length n is an element of pwn 0 1 n the neurons i n for which wi are said to be inactive a partial code of length n is a subset of pwn the variety of a partial motif a is the set of all partial words obtained by replacing all the stars in a by zeros and ones it is denoted by va if c pwn is a a partial code then a pmn is a partial motif of c if va c the set of all partial motifs of a partial code c is denoted by parmot c the set of all maximal partial motifs of a partial code c is denoted by maxparmot c example 4 2 we can think of the partial word w 01 00 1 as of a statement that the neurons 3 and 8 are firing the neurons 2 5 and 6 are not firing and the neurons 1 4 and 7 are inactive the set of all partial motifs a pmn resp partial words w pwn such that ai 1 aik resp wi 1 wik and all the remaining neurons are active is denoted by pmni 1 ik resp pw n i 1 ik it is naturally in a bijective correspondence with the set m n k resp fn k 2 if a resp w is a motif resp word then the polarization of neural codes 19 partial motif resp partial word obtained by replacing each ai resp wi i i 1 ik by is called the partial motif resp partial word obtained by deactivating the neurons i 1 ik and is denoted by ai 1 ik resp wi 1 ik if c fn 2 is a code and i 1 ik n then the code obtained by replacing each wir r 1 k by in each word w c is called the partial code obtained by deactivating the neurons i 1 ik and is denoted by ci 1 ik the partial code ci 1 ik is naturally in a bijective correspondence with the code ci 1 ik obtained by deleting the neurons i 1 ik proposition 4 3 let c be a code in fn 2 and let w pwni 1 ik if w is not an element of ci 1 ik then the motif a obtained from w by replacing each by belongs to mot cc proof easy to see definition 4 4 if a pmn then we define its polarization ap b 1 bnbn 1 b 2 n pm 2 n defined by bi 0 bn 1 when ai 0 bi bn 1 0 when ai 1 bi bn 1 when ai bi bn 1 when ai a partial motif b pm 2 n is called a polar partial motif if b ap for some partial motif a pmn then a bd is called the depolarization of the polar partial motif b the next theorem is a slight reformulation of theorem 5 1 from 5 we give a different proof theorem 4 5 5 theorem 5 1 let c m 2 n and let a m 2 n be the motif obtained by replacing all ones in c by stars let i 1 ik be the set of all elements i of n such that ai ai n then pc jc p if and only if a di 1 ik i 1 n ik n parmot ci 1 ik proof let d cc since maxmot c c p bp b maxmot d the motifs c of c p are the motifs from m 2 n that are disjoint with all b p b maxmot d they give the primes pc and these are all the motivic primes that contain j c p note however that pc jc p if and only if pa jc p it follows that a motivic prime pc contains jc p if and 20 katie christensen and hamid kulosman only if a b p has at least one component equal to 1 or equivalently such that 19 a b p as a 0 2 n and bp 1 2 n for every b maxmot d let i 1 ik be the set of elements i of n such that ai ai n 0 this includes the possibility k 0 let a d denote a di 1 ik i 1 n ik n the statement of the theorem follows if we now justify the claim that a satisfies 19 if and only if each partial word w a d belongs to ci 1 ik i e if and only if a d parmot ci 1 ik the necessity is clear for the sufficiency there would otherwise be a partial word w a d which is not coming from any partial word in ci 1 ik let w be the motif obtained by replacing each in w by then w mot d hence w p mot c c p this motif would have stars at all the components at which a has zeros and ones or stars at all other components hence a w p contradicting to the asumption that a satisfies 19 example 4 6 in the context of the examples 3 20 and 3 24 let c 00 0 m 6 then a c and a d 2 2 0 d 0 also c 2 000 100 110 011 2 0 0 1 0 0 1 hence maxparmot c 2 0 0 thus a d 2 2 maxparmot c 2 so that pc x 1 x 2 y 2 jc p in fact we have pc x 1 x 2 y 2 min jc p let now c 0 0 0 m 6 then a c and a d 3 3 0 d 0 also c 3 000 100 110 011 3 00 10 11 01 hence maxparmot c 3 thus a d 3 3 parmot c 3 polarization of neural codes 21 so that pc x 1 x 3 y 3 jc p note that pc x 1 x 3 y 3 min jc p since it was shown in example 3 24 that the prime x 3 y 3 is a minimal prime of jc p finally let c 100 0 m 6 then a 00 0 and a d 2 2 0 d 0 also c 2 000 100 110 011 2 0 0 1 0 0 1 hence maxparmot c 2 0 0 1 thus a d 2 2 maxparmot c 2 so that pa x 2 x 3 y 2 jc p and pc 1 x 1 x 2 x 3 y 2 jc p note that pa min jc p even though a d 2 2 maxparmot c 2 since it was shown in example 3 24 that the prime x 2 x 3 is a minimal prime of jc p references 1
