wxliang zju edu cn wxliang mail ustc edu cn a h harry essex ac uk abstract how patterns and structures undergo symmetry breaking and self organize within biological systems from initially homogeneous states is a key issue for biological development the activator inhibitor ai mechanism derived from reaction diffusion rd models has been widely believed as the elementary mechanism for biological pattern formation this mechanism generally requires activators to be self enhanced and diffuse more slowly than inhibitors here we identify the instability sources of biological systems through solving eigenvalues dispersion relation of the generalized rd model for two chemicals properties of elementary genetic interaction motifs topology in pattern formation are discussed systematically we show that both the single ai mechanisms with long range inhibition and activation are enough to self organize into fully expressed domains through enhancing the difference in self proliferation rates of activators and inhibitors and weakening the coupling degree between them considering only the ai mechanism is insufficient to drive developmental pattern formation we stress that both inhibitor inhibitor ii and activator activator aa systems need to be involved to drive highly precise and robust biological patterning especially we believe the ii system that is subsequently activated plays a significant role in producing discrete and multi stable patterns through exclusively locking cells into fixed states that realize the cell differentiation and specification keywords reaction diffusion system instability eigenmode genetic topology pattern formation 1 introduction self organized patterning is a hallmark of biological systems at all levels from genomes to ecological systems 1 to understand the underlying universal mechanism have long been of interest to scientists turing was the first to propose a reaction diffusion model to explain biological pattern formation 2 turing s work shows that mathematical models are necessary in biology 3 since they can reveal the essence behind phenomena since the publication of turing s pioneering work in 1952 2 it has been widely believed that morphogen mediated reaction diffusion works as the principal mechanism in many embryonic patterning processes 2 16 in this scenario complex biological patterns are considered to emerge from the complex interactions among interacting and diffusing chemical molecules usually termed morphogens and the genome s role is just to set up the proper initial conditions by its expression of the appropriate set of proteins in the right nuclei thus in turing s view patterns we see in nature are just reflections of the heterogeneities underling biochemical signaling 11 diffusion driven instability proposed by turing has achieved great success in developmental biology and has even been considered as an elementary mechanism for biological patterning in our previous work we have discussed biological pattern formation using the multiscale discrete element method 17 18 however we have not shown the possibility of the continuum theory the turing model in solving key issues of biological development including the precision and robustness of patterning the turing model has its unique advantage in theoretical analysis so we think it should be further stressed in this article we first generalize the formulation of turing model i e the deterministic continuum theory to characterize the interactions between two chemical species properties of elementary interaction modes in mailto wxliang zju edu cn mailto wxliang mail ustc edu cn mailto harry essex ac uk 2 biological pattern formation will be analyzed systematically then we will present the biological basis for corresponding interaction motifs and discuss the precision and robustness of turing models 2 generalized turing model under turing s framework the biological system we studied is abstracted into two reaction diffusion equations for two chemicals expressed by corresponding genes in cells which are coupled by the parameter eq 1 in box 1 obviously the reaction diffusion rd model is a simplification and omits many details like the cellular behaviors e g cell growth and division and the discrete nature of cells which makes this model only qualitative nevertheless such simplifications are necessary for theorists to obtain analytical solutions and effectively extract the key nature of complex systems as in eq 1 box 1 the self reproduction rates of chemicals 1 and 2 and the coupling rates between them 1 and 2 constitute a 2 2 topology matrix for the interaction network between genes a and b 1 1 2 2 the signs of 1 and 2 classify the interaction topology into three types i e the activator inhibitor ai mechanism the inhibitor inhibitor ii mechanism mutual antagonism and the activator activator aa mechanism fig 1 different topologies determine distinctive properties in pattern formation and are introduced next figure 1 topologies of the interaction network between genes a and b a activator inhibitor ai mechanism b inhibitor inhibitor ii mechanism c activator activator aa mechanism dash lines represent that they are not essential and even can be replaced by the positive or negative feedback box 1 turing model reaction diffusion model the turing model i e reaction diffusion rd model is phenomenological for the study of biological systems as it overlooks lower level effects for example for cell populations the turing model often takes the cell interactions which are based on individuals out of consideration instead such interactions are treated as those between subpopulations this situation is rooted in the theory of the rd model itself which is established on a basis of continuum assumption here we show the general formulation for the interaction between any two chemicals a and b which are synthesized respectively by corresponding genes within a one dimensional biological system where d is the spatial diffusion constant is the coupling rate between a and b is the net gain or loss rate t is time and x is position a t d 1 2 a x 2 1 a 1 b t d 2 2 b x 2 2 a 2 b 1 diffusion reaction 3 initial and boundary conditions together constitute definite conditions for the above governing equations i e eq 1 in our calculations reaction diffusion equations are solved through the finite volume method fvm note that during computations both a and b usually need to be constrained by the saturation effect c 1 a b c 2 which corresponds to the upper and lower limits of gene expression in practice 12 the saturation limit value should be large enough compared with initial random chemical perturbations in order to avoid changing reaction kinetics drastically in some literatures chemical concentrations are confined by adding nonlinear saturation terms to the reaction diffusion equations instability of biological system biological patterns are initiated by the instability of a homogenous system the key is to identify instability sources eq 1 is usually analyzed through its linearization 2 19 21 given the plane wave solution c x t aexp ikx iwt fourier modes a is amplitude k is wave number and w is angular frequency the above group of equations can be reduced to an eigenvalue problem w 2 where and the effective hamiltonian is expressed as follows i k 2 d 1 1 i 1 i 2 i k 2 d 2 2 3 we can derive the characteristic equation that corresponds to as m 1 m 2 1 0 4 where m 1 and m 2 are expressed as m 1 iw k 2 d 1 1 1 m 2 iw k 2 d 2 2 2 5 combining eqs 4 and 5 the eigenvalue of this system i e the dispersion relation can be finally solved as w i k 2 d 1 d 2 1 2 2 1 2 k 2 d 1 d 2 2 1 2 2 6 form eq 6 we can obtain the maximum growth rate of instability the imaginary part of eigenvalues as im w 1 2 k 2 d 1 d 2 2 1 2 2 1 2 k 2 d 1 d 2 2 7 where 1 2 k 2 d 1 d 2 2 1 2 2 0 which leads to standing waves in biological systems it can be seen from eq 7 that in motivating exciting the waves instability inside the system chemical diffusion plays the stabilizing role since it can smooth out the spatial difference of chemicals whereas both the differences in the diffusion coefficients and in the self enhancements of chemicals will contribute to the instability which can operate as sources generating patterns symmetry breaking in addition 1 2 0 i e ii and aa mechanisms produces instability more readily than 1 2 0 i e the ai mechanism 3 symmetry breaking a major challenge in biology is to understand the mechanisms which drive the pattern formation during 4 various processes such as development 13 14 how can a highly structured multicellular organism become stably developed from an initially homogenous zygote despite the entropy reduction in this process such a process corresponds to symmetry breaking events in physics which means a reduction in the uniformity of the system 15 we know that embryonic development is the outcome of differential gene expression in cells which results from cell interactions 16 22 and finally leads to cell differentiation and specification symmetry breaking but which are the root causes that are driving the differences between cells in the turing model this question is reduced to how small spatial fluctuations in a well mixed system are unstable and become amplified 23 fourier analysis box 1 shows that instability of the system of two reacting and diffusing chemicals could come from 1 the self enhancement of chemicals i e the self proliferation rate 1 2 0 2 the difference in self reproduction rates 1 2 3 the difference in diffusion coefficients d 1 d 2 and 4 the positive product of coupling rates 1 2 0 which can all serve as the sources of symmetry breaking of a biological system figure 2 properties of activator inhibitor ai mechanism the inhibitor inhibitor ii mechanism and the activator activator aa mechanism between chemicals genes a and b in one dimensional

0 01 and g d 0 1 periodic boundary conditions are used how the periodic patterns are established in organisms is central to biology an obvious example is the development of spine and digits we show in fig 2 the pattern formation generated by eq 1 box 1 in a one dimensional biological system initially there is a very small random fluctuation in a and b which are in a steady and nearly homogeneous state fig 2 a under the activator inhibitor mechanism the difference in diffusion coefficients of activators and inhibitors is the driver of instability in the system and starts a growth in both activators and inhibitors fig 2 b the original symmetry in the system is then broken down and a highly structured and a regular pattern with a single wave mode is finally established fig 2 c the generation 5 of a periodic and stable pattern as in fig 2 c requires the faster diffusion of inhibitors than activators later we will see that long range inhibition is not necessary for self organization of this ai mechanism this is the well known diffusion driven instability proposed by turing for the inhibitor inhibitor mechanism and the activator activator mechanism our results show that the patterning can be started without the difference in diffusion of the two interacting species but the patterns generated are irregular figs 2 d g for an initially random distribution of chemicals in fig 2 a the irregularity of patterns in the aa and ii systems indicates the stabilization of multiple unstable wave modes within the system this is owing to the inherent strong instability of ii and aa mechanisms themselves see eq 7 in box 1 which work like a single positive feedback loop 24 such strong instability locks both ii and aa systems into fixed states in an irreversible way i e cell fate decision and produces robust patterns figs 2 d g for all of these three topologies i e ai ii and aa mechanisms the region width of pattern structures is scaled by the diffusion constant and increases with it figs 2 d g also as shown in fig 2 under the activator inhibitor mechanism both of the interacting species genes are in an activated state at each site of the system fig 2 c while for the ii and aa systems both species a and b are in fully activated state on state at some sites and in fully silent state off state at some other sites figs 2 d g the difference between the ii mechanism and aa mechanism is that for the ii mechanism the terminal states of species a and b are absolutely opposite at any site within the system i e in opposed phase for the aa mechanism the states of a and b are always the same at each site within the system i e in the same phase in analogy to boolean operation the ii mechanism seems to work as the logic not and the aa mechanism works as the logic and these unique properties will determine their specific roles of ai ii and aa mechanisms in organisms figure 3 regular patterns produced by the inhibitor inhibitor ii mechanism and the activator activator aa mechanism under the odd initial condition in one dimensional biological system a regular initial spatial fluctuation in species a and b the initial distributions of a and b are opposed in phase i e odd initial conditions b c the final spatial distribution of a and b within system the two systems ii and aa are shown in schematics with the interaction and diffusion coefficients indications periodic boundary conditions are used both ii and aa mechanisms cannot self regulate the system into regular patterns from an initially disordered state figs 2 d g however this doesn t mean a ii or aa system cannot play a part in producing regular patterns as seen in fig 3 regular spatial structures which have a single wave mode can be produced only when the odd initial conditions are imposed for both ii and aa systems this shows that to generate regular patterns for the ii or aa system regular signals need to be pre established the results above are derived from only extreme parameter examples of genetic topologies we now further 6 systematically discuss pattern formation properties of topology parameters according to eq 7 the most unstable wave happens at k k 0 namely d 1 d 2 a 2 1 2 d 1 d 2 2 0 8 where a k 2 d 1 d 2 2 1 eq 8 has non zero nontrivial solutions only when 1 2 0 namely for ai systems in this case the solutions km satisfies km 2 1 2 d 1 d 2 1 2 d 1 d 2 d 1 d 2 9 for aa and ii systems 1 2 0 k is generally the monotonic function of wave number k which leads to no stable waves within the system the wave number km is zero figure 4 pattern formation of the ai mechanism with long range inhibition a c e growth rate of the unstable waves as the function of the wave number b d f the final unstable wave of the

then we can see from eqs 7 and 9 that km will not vary but the function k will shift up down as a whole fig 4 a changing the instability strength of unstable waves fig 4 a presents k for d 2 4 d 1 4 and 1 2 2 we can see the most unstable wave emerges at the mode 1 6 that finally dominates the system by suppressing other modes of unstable waves fig 4 b an unexpected result is that when decreases and approximates to but is still beyond zero which means it still satisfies the classical ai mechanism the final wave sharply converges to zero in its amplitude and cannot stabilizes in the system see fig 4 b for the case 1 0 7 and 2 1 3 a similar phenomenon has been mentioned by smith and dalchau 25 these results seem to suggest that to finally stabilize the wave within the system a sufficiently high instability strength of the wave is needed i e the growth rate of the most unstable wave should be beyond some small positive number from fig 4 b we can also see that when both 1 and 2 increase and exceed specific values flat patterns of the chemical a activator which tend to only occur with the involvement of the ii mechanism can also be established this suggests that some special pattern formation functions that are similar to that of the ii system may be achieved by enhancing singly self proliferation rates of chemicals in the ai system for the same case we now vary 1 2 from fig 4 c we can see that with the increase of 1 2 the most unstable wave number km decreases which causes the increment in the wave length of patterns fig 4 d when 1 2 exceeds some value flat patterns can be created since the instability strength of the unstable wave is enhanced fig 4 c we further consider the case 1 1 fig 4 e shows that increasing would increase the most unstable mode km causing the decreasing wave length of patterns fig 4 f these results suggest that the scaling and flattening of turing patterns can be realized through tuning the difference in self proliferation rates and the product of coupling rates of interacting chemicals just as shown in eq 9 in particular there are topological parameter ranges where the ai mechanism can give rise to less regular patterns e g the case 1 1 4 and 2 1 0 in fig 4 c and the cases 0 7 and 0 9 in fig 4 e the irregularity of patterns may mean multiple unstable wave modes have been stabilized within the system corresponding to the little difference in their k which causes the most unstable mode hard to fully suppress other modes we still consider the typical ai case 1 1 1 2 if d 1 d 2 namely the long range activation we have km 2 1 2 d 1 d 2 d 1 d 2 d 1 d 2 according to eq 9 fig 5 shows that patterns can also be self organized and stabilized within the system with the chemicals a and b are in opposed or identical phase in some previous work 20 25 the ai mechanism with long range activation is also termed the activator substrate as mechanism the scaling and flattening of patterns of this mechanism can also be realized through tuning the difference in self proliferation rates the product of coupling rates and diffusion speed of interacting chemicals it s necessary to point out that the case in fig 5 d is actually the classical turing mechanism but with short range inhibition which further suggests the long range inhibition or even the difference in diffusion is not necessary for the self organization of the single ai mechanism the most unstable mode of this mechanism in theory is still km 0 fig 5 a but it cannot always succeed in fully suppressing the other modes within some topological parameter ranges causing the irregularity of patterns this unexpected exception is missed in the recent classification discussion of the 2 node network type i 26 of course the long range inhibition is still required for this mechanism to establish regular patterns i e have nontrivial wave mode km 0 8 figure 5 pattern formation of the ai mechanism with long range activation a growth rate of the unstable waves as the function of the wave number b c d the final unstable waves of chemicals a and b within the system d 1 8 d 2 8 we further discuss aa and ii systems fig 6 shows that no waves can be stabilized within the aa system if 0 0 when we increase 2 to reach 0 0 heterogeneous chemical patterns will be established we can also see that for the same topology parameters increasing diffusion speed of chemicals easily leads to the emergence of homogenous patterns k 0 the reason is probably that high chemical diffusion makes the growth rate of the wave mode k 0 obviously higher than other modes i e the more sloped distribution of k see fig 6 a which contributes to the suppression of other modes and the final stabilization of the mode k 0 the ii system shows a similar property of the stabilization of patterns part of results are shown in fig 7 from fig 7 we can see that both positive and negative 1 and 2 can lead to the stabilization of heterogeneous patterns the stabilization of irregular patterns means the stabilization of multiple unstable wave modes within the system which may result from the flat distribution of k where the mode k 0 cannot fully suppress other modes to dominate the system see fig 7 a figure 6 pattern formation of the aa mechanism a growth rate of the unstable waves as the function of the wave number b the final pattern of the chemical a within the

the rd model can produce a nearly limitless variety of spatial patterns through tuning model parameters and boundary conditions 27 incorporating more complex gene interaction networks 8 and modeling on the discrete media with a skeleton of complex networks 28 29 the remarkable similarity between patterns observed in the framework of 2 d turing model and those seen in real organisms has been presented by kondo and miura 27 three two dimensional patterns simulated by the eq 1 box 1 are presented in fig 8 in agreement with the 1 d case the final pattern excited by a single ii mechanism is

pattern formation due to its ability to explain self regulation and scaling of pattern formation which are key characteristics of developmental biology 6 as shown in table 1 the activator inhibitor mechanism has been claimed to be identified in various embryonic development processes such as wnt dkk 31 33 nodal lefty 34 35 and fgf bmp 36 pairs including the head regeneration in hydra hair follicle spacing in mouse and the left right asymmetry in mouse embryos in vivo the mutual inhibition i e ii mechanism was observed in the formation of pigment patterns of zebrafish where both melanophores and xanthophores show the short range exclusive effect against one another 37 the ii mechanism was also found to be able to enhance the metastatic ability of nodules in mouse 38 and make cell fate decisions in c elegans 39 in addition to those natural ii systems in organisms the ii system was already synthesized artificially in escherichia coli showing a robust bi stability that functioned as a toggle switch between two different fates 40 the aa mechanism was observed to play the part in diverse progressive processes table 1 due to its ability to convert graded inputs into all or none outputs such as a mitotic trigger 41 eukaryotic chemotaxis 42 spontaneous cell polarization 43 cell fate specification and decision 44 47 blood clotting etc the aa network motif has also been analyzed by uri alon 24 we note that the activator inhibitor model which is based on the rd mechanism involved in some of the developmental processes above has not been fully recognized by experimental researchers 27 we have shown here that long range inhibition or the difference in diffusion is not essential for self organization of the classical ai mechanism diffusion is not a must for pattern formation either besides although many ii and aa mechanisms have been identified in organisms their direct involvement in the process of biological pattern formation still largely remains to be revealed table 1 ai ii and aa mechanisms in organisms identified by molecular experiments 11 5 precision of turing model the precise positioning of gene expression domains in cell populations is a big challenge for the current understanding of developmental pattern formation 48 such as the development of spine as discussed above the single activator inhibitor mechanism is enough to produce patterns but its precision has been under question 7 as seen in figs 2 c and 8 a patterns produced by this mechanism are continuously graded and have no well defined region boundaries in morphogenesis however cells fates are often controlled very precisely at specific positions take the zebra stripe shown in fig 9 a for an example there are domains composed of pigment cells which are completely segregated in space and one cannot find a different pigment within another pigment s domain the activator inhibitor mechanism and even the whole rd process have been questioned because of this problem since the graded morphogen gradients generated by diffusion are believed to be too messy to drive the tissue patterning in organisms 7 figure 9 a illustration of zebra stripes with discrete domains the mutual antagonism between expression states of white and black genes probably indicates the involvement of ii mechanism in pattern formation b interpretation of morphogen signals in french flag model morphogen gradient provides the position information to cells and makes them transform the information into the final region specific fates to explain the formation of patterns with well defined discontinuous domains the french flag model 49 has been proposed in this model it is postulated that different pigment genes are activated by a graded morphogen distribution providing different position information in a concentration dependent manner with corresponding thresholds 7 fig 9 b cells will adopt different fates at the signaling levels which are below and above the thresholds 6 although many morphogens with several thresholds of gene expression induction have been identified by experiments 50 54 it is still a puzzle for this model why one gene cannot be activated on the higher morphogen transcriptional factor concentration if it can be activated at a lower level of concentration it is also hard to explain the generation of periodic patterns as in fig 9 a with the french flag model we believe that the precision problem of turing model does not root in diffusion itself but in the single selection of the ai mechanism with inappropriate topological parameters fig 10 further shows that the single ai mechanism can obtain precise stable patterns with well defined domains through tuning topology parameters including elevating self proliferation rates of chemicals and weakening the coupling degree between activators and inhibitors for the ai mechanism with long range inhibition interacting chemicals are in the same phase fig 10 a while chemicals are in opposed or identical phase for the long range activation figs 10 b and 10 c nevertheless the single ai mechanism is hard to produce the multi stable developmental patterns where multiple interacting genes can suppress the others in full and establish fully activated regions as in fig 9 we deduce from the properties of single ai ii and aa mechanisms that the generation of periodic biological patterns with discrete domains like the zebra stripe is the outcome of a combination of ai and ii aa 12 mechanisms that is the ai mechanism first produces the crude but regular signals for cells to interpret and then the ii aa mechanism is involved in locking cells into fixed states according to the crude cues provided figure 10 precise 2 d pattern formation of the single ai mechanism a the ai mechanism with long range inhibition spatial distribution of the chemical a b c the ai mechanism with long range activation spatial distribution of b the chemical a and c the chemical b periodic boundary conditions are used for the zebra stripes shown in fig 9 a for instance the antagonistic relationship between white and black stripes probably indicates the involvement of the ii mechanism we verified this deduction in fig 11 we use the patterned structures resulting from the ai system as the signal inputs of the ii system and we obtain refined patterns with clear domain boundaries evidently the combination between ai and ii mechanisms has dramatically enhanced the precision of patterning at the same time chemicals c and d suppress each other in full within specific expression domains as in above fig 3 b figure 11 refinement of patterns by ii mechanism a regular spatial distribution of signals produced by ai mechanism distribution of a b the terminal regular pattern refined by the ii mechanism distribution of c periodic boundary conditions are used fig 11 suggests that adding an ii system after an ai one is able to enhance the precision of biological 13 pattern formation and the opposed genes are in full activation within their own dominant domains just as disclosed in our previous study 18 to further identify the pattern formation properties of such a mechanism we consider the designed sequential combination of ai and ii mechanisms in fig 12 a within the current genetic interaction network the ii subsystem is started after the ai subsystem with a time delay t fig 12 d shows that if the time delay is short there will be some error for the gene c to interpret signals from the gene a in some positions since the ii system starts before the ai system hasn t reached the steady state figs 12 e and 12 f suggest that the precision of pattern formation can be improved through elevating the mutual inhibition degree of the ii system and the activation degree from the ai system fig 12 g suggests that the slow or even no diffusion of ii system is required for the highly precise patterning figure 12 bi stable stripe formation of the sequential ai ii mechanism a genetic

conditions are used in a recent in vivo study the combination of ai and ii mechanisms consisting of the bmp sox 9 wnt gene network was observed in the digit pattering of mouse fig 13 55 wnt was pointed out to be essential to 14 repress sox 9 in the interdigital regions fig 13 c which actually suggests the necessity of the ii mechanism consisting of wnt and sox 9 in precise patterning of this process note that in the current bmp sox 9 wnt gene network activator bmp is required to diffuse faster than inhibitor wnt to generate periodic patterns fig 13 d nevertheless this multigene network still follows the classical long range inhibition in turing models since activator bmp actually behaves the inhibitory role on wnt whereas inhibitor wnt plays the promoting role on bmp moreover the current genetic topology network is hard to produce multi stable patterns like zebra stripes that are established with the gene network in fig 12 figure 13 digit patterning mechanism identified in

conditions e g the periodic boundary conditions and zero flux boundary conditions etc are imposed even the different sets of small random initial fluctuations in a and b will generate the different spatial orders of a and b see fig 10 this sensitivity may correspond to the remarkable diversity of color patterns as seen in real organisms e g the skin pattern of one zebra or one s fingerprint differs from each other however for biological development exhibiting a highly reproducible and robust behavior this high sensitivity to noisy environmental conditions is infeasible especially when other influencing factors such as gene expression time delays 11 28 57 the cross diffusion between chemicals 58 and domain growth 11 59 60 are incorporated other stabilizing mechanisms must be involved like the involvement of flattening ai mechanism ii and aa mechanisms and the sequential fate making robustly encoded in cells genes 10 the rd system can also become insensitive to external perturbations and generate robust patterns if boundary conditions such as the fixed boundary conditions are set to be non homogenous with respect to the kinetic steady state 61 as shown in fig 12 the fixed boundary conditions needed to generate reproducible patterns may correspond to the highly encoded cell fates in animal development 62 7 summary biological pattern formation is widely believed to be the outcome of complex interactions among reacting and diffusing chemicals within biological systems local self activation and lateral long range inhibition has been derived from reaction diffusion models turing models and achieved success in developmental biology 15 since it can explain the self regulation and scaling of biological patterning in this article we show that long range inhibition is not necessary for the single ai mechanism to self organize into patterns another obvious problem of turing models is the low precision and robustness which have made many researchers reluctant to believe the rd mechanism here we propose that the problem does not lie in the diffusion itself but in the single selection of ai mechanism with improper topology parameters the proper tuning of genetic interaction parameters and the sequential combination among ai ii and aa mechanisms are the likely solutions the rd mechanism is involved in the mechanism of precise developmental patterning as long as ii or aa mechanism is incorporated in particular the ii system that is subsequently activated may take a part in the self organization of gene patterns with multi stability however the direct involvement of ii and aa mechanisms in biological patterning which is based on diffusing activators and inhibitors largely remains to be disclosed the turing mechanism has been widely believed to be the main mechanism of biological pattern formation over many levels from intracellular patterning like cell division 1 63 64 and the gradient formation of intracellular proteins 65 to animal development like the digit formation 55 and the somitogenesis 3 and to ecological evolutions 66 with the further development of biology we have reason to believe that more and more evidences will support the rd mechanism however we highlight that the rd mechanism is not the only one which can produce periodic patterns since the tissue level patterning in organisms often emerges from the events which happed inside single cells 1 to clearly understand how the subcellular events influence the behaviors at the tissue level advanced multiscale models with the links from molecular to tissue levels are required 48 references 1 kretschmer s and schwille p pattern formation on membranes and its role in bacterial cell division curr opin cell biol 38 52 59 2016 2 turing a m the chemical basis
