china corresponding author e mail lolfcm imu edu cn ll abstract the phylogenetic tree of sars cov 2 ncov 19 viruses is reconstructed according to the similarity of genome sequences the tree topology of betacoronavirus is remarkably consistent with biologist s systematics because the tree construction contains enough information about virus mutants it is suitable to study the evolutionary relationship between novel coronavirus mutants transmitted among humans the emergences of 14 kinds of main mutants are studied and these strains can be classified as eight bifurcations of the phylogenetic tree it is found that there exist three types of virus mutations namely the mutation among sub branches of the same branch the off root mutation and the root oriented mutation between large branches of the tree from the point of the relation between viral mutation and host selection we found that individuals with low immunity provide a special environment for the positive natural selection of virus evolution it gives a mechanism to explain why large mutations between two distant branches generally occur mailto lolfcm imu edu cn in the ncov 19 phylogenetic tree the finding is helpful to formulate strategies to control the spread of covid 19 key words ncov 19 phylogenetic tree information correlation off root mutation root oriented mutation incomplete immunity introduction the rapidly expanding genetic diversity of sars cov 2 ncov 19 viruses provides a great deal of information about virus mutation gisaid introduced a nomenclature system for major clades based on marker mutations 1 then gisaid clades are augmented with more detailed lineages assigned by the phylogenetic assignment of named global outbreak lineages pango lineage tool 2 recently on 31 may 2021 world health organization who announced that the greek alphabet will be used to refer to the main covid 19 mutant virus in the future 3 now we found that more than ten variants alpha beta gamma delta kappa epsilon theta iota zeta lambda omicron etc have been widely spread among humans what is their evolutionary relationship the ncov 19 viruses spread in human is thought to belong to sarbecovirus of betacoronavirus that infers a possible bat origin 4 9 however there should exist some intermediate hosts in animal between the bat origin and the virus spreading in human although recent works discovered that the genome of malayan pangolin coronaviruses shows high similarity to ncov 19 little is known about the problem of who is the real intermediate host 10 13 let us put the problem aside for the time being and in this paper we will focus on how the ncov 19 mutates in human it is hoped that this will enlighten the problem of tracing source of ncov 19 and searching for its intermediate host about the calculation method of phylogenetic analysis starting from information theory with the emphasize of base correlation property of the genome sequence we proposed ic pic method and used it in deducing the phylogenetic tree of betacoronavirus 14 16 the careful analysis of early 2019 ncov tree was given in 16 however limited to the virus data at that time we were unable to study the various mutants of novel coronavirus now we will use ic pic method in this paper to make phylogenetic analysis based on a wealth of virus mutation data to reveal the law of how novel coronavirus mutates to produce evolutionary bifurcations methods we suggested the average mutual information ami and k departed base correlation can be looked as the signature of a given genome sequence 17 the average mutual information is called information correlation ic defined by 2 2 2 2 log log k i i i k j i k j i ij d p p p p and the k departed base correlation is called partial information correlation pic defined by 2 i k j i k j i j f p p p where pi means the probability of base i in the sequence and pi k j means the joint probability of base pair ij departed by distance k k 0 1 2 in the following we shall study the sars cov 2 phylogeny by using ic pic algorithm based on the above set of signatures of the genome sequence the ncov 19 viruses genomes used in our analyses were downloaded from the gisaid https gisaid org platform the genome sequence is converted into an ic pic matrix with 17 rows representing 1 ic for given k and 16 pics of different base correlation categories and d columns representing the distance k between base pair k 0 1 to d 1 the only parameter in the algorithm is the range of d which is denoted as k k is determined from the best fit construction of tree in general the deduced tree changes with k and attains stable at some large value the work is carried out on ic pic web server 18 after uploading input data in fasta format setting the parameter k value and choosing the neighbor joining nj option the server will run the program and for each run of given d d 1 to k stepping 1 deduce a phylogenetic tree in the calculation the evolutionary distance of any two genomes is calculated by euclidean distance between their respective ic pic 17 xd matrices then an unrooted nj tree is generated finally k phylogenetic trees are combined to generate a consensus tree all these trees were constructed by using neighbor and consense program in the phylip package 19 the robustness of the tree topology was estimated by branch support results and discussions the whole genome based phylogenetic trees for ncov 19 are deduced by use of ic pic method and given in fig 1 to reconstruct the phylogenetic tree the sequence data of 150 viruses are used the consensus tree is derived from 50 k 50 trees based on ic pic matric the robustness of the tree topology was estimated by branch support the nj consensus tree is drawn with avian viruses as out group however the comparison between k 50 and larger k shows that the deduced tree attains stable at k 50 the tree topology remains also unchanged under different choices of the out group betacoronavirus contains five subgenus namely sarbecovirus hibecovirus nobecovirus embecovirus and merbecovirus the phylogenetic tree of betacoronavirus genus is shown in fig 1 from fig 1 we found that the tree topology is remarkably consistent with biologist s systematics that embecovirus merbecovirus nobecovirus and hibecovirus bifurcated first and then sars cov 1 and 2 related and ncov 19 formed their own clade respectively 9 10 we confirmed current taxonomic classification of the ncov 19 as sarbecovirus sub genus and supported the assumption that the ncov 19 is of bat origin above results show that our ic pic method is reliable further in order to carefully study the variation of the virus as it spreads among humans we have included 115 human virus mutation data in the tree of 150 sequences the schematic diagram fig 2 is deduced from the tree topology of fig 1 for 115 human ncov 19 viruses figure 2 combined with fig 1 gives the details of human novel coronavirus mutation that provide new understanding on the rapidly expanding genetic diversity of ncov 19 viruses about the ncov 19 evolution in humans the phylogenetic analysis gives 1 emergence of mutants and their evolutionary bifurcation the phylogenetic tree is deduced from the closeness relationship of sequence characteristics the deduced phylogenetic tree of 115 human ncov 19 viruses shows eight main bifurcations which constitutes eight major clades of mutants fig 2 two clades omicron and lambda are located in the lowest bifurcation near the root of the phylogenetic tree three mutants alpha eta and gamma constitute a major clade emerging from the bifurcation no 1 of the phylogenetic tree two mutants kappa and delta constitute next clade emerging from the bifurcation no 2 of the phylogenetic tree three mutants beta iota and theta constitute another clade emerging from the bifurcation no 3 of the tree then zeta gh epsilon g as independent clades emerge from the bifurcation no 4 to 6 respectively finally l s and v constitute the last clade emerging from the bifurcation no 7 of the tree 2 the spatio temporal localization of mutants and their dynamical variation and evolutionary trajectory l s v are early amino acid mutants they are thought to have no important amino acid mutation effects d 614 g mutation in spike protein was firstly reported in italy in february 2020 that obviously increases the infectivity of the virus the mutant is named g then in may 2020 l 452 r mutation was reported in usa that has strong ability of immune escape the mutant is named epsilon or gh from gh to omicron there are 12 important new mutants given in fig 2 note that all these mutants appeared in a given area that is because the geographical isolation plays a role in species formation each of them appeared also in a given time interval of 2020 apart from two theta and omicron in 2021 the time and place of the emergence of all these mutants were recorded in detail therefore we are able to depict the evolutionary trajectories of mutants in principle for example alpha firstly occurred in uk in september 2020 and then quickly spread to other countries germany france italy usa thailand and india etc on the other hand both kappa and delta occurred firstly in india in october 2020 it was reported alpha kappa and delta coexisted in india in the early stage at the beginning the three competed and then delta got the upper hand becoming the main strain in india one can assume kappa and delta have common precursor and alpha is the possible candidate of the precursor another example is zeta and gamma occurred firstly in brazil in april 2020 and november 2020 respectively in the early stage zeta as the main strain was reported then it was reported zeta and gamma mixed and finally gamma was the main strain in brazil one can assume zeta is the precursor of gamma moreover the mutant lambda occurred in peru in july 2020 and it was mixed with gamma in the early stage one can assume lambda and gamma have common precursor above examples show that there exist a complex evolutionary network of human ncov 19 viruses which should be carefully searched for 3 three kinds of ncov 19 viral mutation the ncov 19 viral mutation happens in a not too long time of only one or two years in the following three types 1 the mutation between sub branches in the same large branch 2 the mutation occurring between adjacent or non adjacent large branches in the direction deviating from the root called off root mutation and 3 the mutation between large branches in the direction towards the root of the tree called root oriented mutation the possible mutations between alpha eta and gamma between kappa and delta and between beta iota and theta belong to the first category the possible mutations of alpha to delta etc belong to the second category the possible mutations of zeta to gamma ls vs to g and g to gh epsilon the emergence of lambda in peru in july 2020 and the emergence of omicron in south africa in november 2021 etc belong to the third category it is found most mutations belong to the third category 4 mechanism of virus mutation and natural selection looking at the problem from the general point of view of evolutionary theory why the ncov 19 mutation can occur between two distant branches and most in the direction towards the root the evolution of virus is closely related to its host the ic pic tree of viruses is constructed according to the sequence similarity the sequences located on the same branch have stronger similarity and the mutation between them should have higher probability therefore the new species should gradually emerge at the top of the tree branches at given host this is the usual pattern of virus evolution before it sneaked in humans in fact the source host of the virus is bat the selection pressure of the virus in bats is very small bats had evolved a tolerant immune system that allows nearly all kinds of viruses replicate in their bodies 20 on the other hand although little is known about the intermediate hosts if one assumes that the selection pressure felt by the viruses in the intermediate hosts is not great in most cases then the viruses can adapt to the environment with fewer mutations generally the above examples are consistent with the construction of phylogenetic tree fig 1 and do not violate the usual pattern of virus evolution however as the virus emerging into humans the human immune system is a special environment for viruses because the mutation is essentially at random only those large virus mutations for example mutations between distant branches are likely to include immune escape mutations and adapt to the environment in other words the immune escape mutation of ncov 19 needs external selection and the selection comes from incomplete immunity of the host weak immunity to the virus therefore from the relation between mutation and selection we infer that the immune escape mutations to be really selected can only happen in hosts with incomplete immunity 21 the point that individuals with low immunity provide a special environment for virus evolution has been tested in experiments as early as in the spread of alpha in uk the ncov 19 evolution during treatment of chronic infection was studied 22 it was observed that the mutant of the virus in the patient showed a reduced susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies and a higher level of viral infectivity the recent emergence of omicron in south africa provides another evidence of virus fast evolution in people with low immunity south africa has many people infected with hiv which suppresses the immune system who were more suitable for ncov 19 evolution 23 the above examples explained why the large mutations between two distant branches can be selected and the corresponding sars cov 2 mutants do occur in experiments in the meantime since the root oriented mutation has more possibilities than the off root mutation in statistics most observed ncov 19 mutations belong to the root oriented category summary the emergence of ncov 19 variants that posed an increased risk to global public health prompted the global monitoring and research on their nucleotide mutations to assist with public discussions of variants evolution this paper summarizes various mutations that have taken place in the spread of ncov 19 in humans from a fundamental point of view the view of phylogeny first the ic pic method is used to reconstruct the phylogenetic tree of betacoronavirus and the tree topology is remarkably consistent with biologist s systematics it gives supplementary evidence of the reliability of this method second based on the phylogenetic tree of ncov 19 in humans and the spatio temporal record of the virus mutations we found three mutation categories existing in the rapidly expanding genetic diversity of ncov 19 namely the mutation among sub branches the off root mutation and the root oriented mutation between large branches of the tree and the most mutations belong to the third category third the relation of virus mutation and selection in humans is discussed we found the individuals with low immunity provide a special environment for virus evolution since the condition of selection for virus evolution in humans might be very different from the usual pattern large mutations between two distant branches and even the root oriented mutations can occur above conclusions are helpful to formulate covid 19 s prevention and control strategy the ncov 19 mutations occurred mainly in 2020 but it still happened in 2021 there is no evidence that covid 19 pandemic is coming to an end at omicron oppositely the longer the disease spreads the more likely the virus is to mutate since the individuals with low immunity provide the positive selection to virus mutation to minimize the mutation of the virus the international society should pay special attention to the health of these people what is more noteworthy is that asymptomatic infected persons may have incomplete immunity 24 and they need vaccinated to strengthen their immunity acknowledgements we
