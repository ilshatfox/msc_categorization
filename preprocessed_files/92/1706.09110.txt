cells graphene glial differentiation abstract there is urgent clinical need to improve the clinical outcome of peripheral nerve injury many efforts are directed towards the fabrication of bioengineered conduits which could deliver stem cells to the site of injury to promote and guide peripheral nerve regeneration the aim of this study is to assess if graphene and related nanomaterials can be useful in the fabrication of such conduits a comparison is made between go and reduced go substrates our results show that the graphene substrates are highly biocompatible and the reduced go substrates are more effective in increasing the gene expression of the biomolecules involved in the regeneration process compared to the other substrates studied mailto aravind manchester ac uk 1 introduction schwann cells sc are key cellular elements in assisting the regeneration of peripheral nerve after injury sc switch from a myelinating to repair phenotype which results in increased expression of extracellular matrix ecm proteins neurotrophins and growth factors furthermore sc undergo profound morphological changes which result in upregulation of filament cytoskeletal proteins such as nestin and actin 1 2 despite a clear need for novel therapies use of sc as a clinical intervention for peripheral nerve injury pni is problematic due to the necessity of harvesting a functional nerve and the limited expansion capacity of sc as a clinically viable alternative mesenchymal stem cells and adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells ascs have been differentiated in vitro towards a schwann like cells phenotype 3 4 these differentiated adipose stem cells dascs express glial markers such as glial fibrillary acidic protein gfap s 100 and p 75 4 express myelin protein 5 and myelin structures when in co culture with neurons 6 7 and when implanted in bioengineered conduits to repair murine peripheral nerve gap in vivo dasc have demonstrated promotion of nerve regeneration reduction of muscle atrophy increased nerve conduction velocity and higher rates of myelination 8 11 graphene and related nanomaterials can play an important role in the fabrication of bioengineered nerve conduits for the treatment of peripheral nerve injuries although the biocompatibility of these materials for in vivo studies depends on many variables such as the thickness the lateral size of the flakes the level of hydrophilicity and the extent of functionalization 12 it can be stated that when these materials were used as coatings on surfaces to support stem cell growth the extent of cytotoxicity was limited and enhanced stem cell differentiation was reported 13 17 graphene and related nanomaterials were found to be effective in positively modulating axonal outgrowth and nerve regeneration in vitro 18 21 thus far researchers have been exploring the effect of graphene and related nanomaterials on the neurite outgrowth but there have not been studies regarding the effect of these materials in supporting the growth of dascs the aim of this study is then the biological characterization of graphene oxide go and reduced go rgo coated coverslips and verify if these materials are able to sustain the differentiated dascs phenotype which is rapidly lost following withdrawal of growth factors 2 materials and methods 2 1 graphene based materials synthesis substrates

graphpad prism 6 0 graphpad software la jolla ca usa using a one way anova test followed by dunnett s multiple comparison test using glass as a control sample level of significance was expressed as p values 3 results and discussion 3 1 substrates characterization optical microscopy and afm showed the uniformity of thin film coverage on the substrate and no empty areas were observable on the substrates as shown in fig 1 a d raman spectroscopy is a useful tool to detect the presence of graphene oxide on any surfaces the typical spectrum of go is composed by two peaks the d peak at 1350 cm 1 and the g peak at 1586 cm 1 the intensity ratio id ig between these two peaks is employed to characterize go dispersions the measured id ig of go was 0 92 while upon thermal reduction we noticed a decreased id ig down to 0 84 fig 1 e f xps c 1 s spectra of all the different substrates can be deconvoluted into 6 components c c sp 2 carbon at 284 6 ev c c sp 3 carbon at 285 1 ev c oh at 286 ev c o c at 286 9 ev c o at 287 7 ev and ho c o at 288 8 ev fig 1 g 25 26 successful reduction is confirmed by the c 1 s spectrum of rgo we noticed a clear decrease in all the oxygen functionalities with the exception of hydroxyl group a decrease in sp 3 carbon and increased sp 2 carbon as shown in fig 1 h as previously reported 14 graphene based materials are efficient materials for the fabrication of artificial scaffolds in regenerative medicine in fact graphene and related nanomaterials are characterised by ultra high specific surface area and by the ability of binding stem cells growth inducers both covalently and non covalently acting as a pre concentration platform for growth factors and other biomolecules present in the differentiation medium starting form this observation human dascs were cultured on the substrates to assess cell proliferation and the effect of the substrate on the gene expression of glial markers 3 2 proliferation of dascs on graphene substrates to assess dascs proliferation rate on the different substrates studied we used mts assay we selected three time points on day 1 day 4 and day 7 after seeding as it can be seen on fig 2 a the proliferation rate of dascs on both go and rgo substrates was comparable to glass coverslips used as controls with values only marginally lower at each time points to assess the biocompatibility of the substrates and confirm that the slightly reduced proliferation was not due to go rgo cytotoxicity we performed a live dead viability assay after 48 hours of cellular growth on the different substrates indeed at each time point we measured that 99 89 0 01 of cells were alive on go substrates 99 80 0 02 of cells were alive on rgo coverslips and finally 99 87 0 02 of cells were alive on glass substrates we can therefore conclude that although the proliferation rate was marginally slower on the rgo and go coverslips the amount of live cells was very high and comparable in all the different substrates studied we then decided to study the gene expression of crucial proteins and growth factors which are key features of the differentiated state of dasc and are involved in the peripheral nerve regeneration process 3 3 gene expression studies key molecules involved in the regeneration process are neurotrophins these growth factors are involved in neuronal survival development and functionality 27 28 29 we decided to focus our attention studying brain derived neurotrophic factor bdnf nerve growth factor ngf and glial derived neurotrophic factor gdnf also another group of protein molecules involved in the regeneration process are intermediate filament proteins such as nestin and vimentin which are strictly related to the profound morphological changes associated with sc response to injury nestin is a protein which is involved in the axonal growth and is normally up regulated after nerve injury 30 31 32 33 moreover a recent study highlighted that nestin positive hair follicle pluripotent stem cells were able to promote peripheral nerve regeneration 34 interestingly a bigger proportion of asc were found to express nestin filaments compared to bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells 4 vimentin is reported to be up regulated during peripheral nerve regeneration and higher expression levels of this protein have been reported to augment the peripheral nerve regeneration 35 lastly we decided to investigate also the gene expression of neurotrophins receptor such as trkb trkc and ret as a measure of growth factor responsiveness of dascs gdnf expression is increased on rgo coverslips 1 64 0 06 vs glass p 0 01 n 3 and no statistical difference is observed between go coverslips and the glass controls the expression of bdnf is increased on rgo and go coverslips 1 53 0 08 p 0 01 vs glass n 3 on rgo substrates and 1 68 0 01 p 0 001 vs glass n 3 on go substrates ngf expression increased on rgo coverslips 1 67 0 14 p value 0 01 while go substrates behaved as glass controls fig 3 a c nestin expression is increased on both rgo and go substrates 1 44 0 05 p 0 01 vs glass n 3 on rgo substrates and 1 31 0 11 p 0 05 vs glass n 3 on go substrates vimentin expression is increased on both rgo and go substrates 1 66 0 04 p 0 001 vs glass n 3 on rgo substrates and 1 67 0 01 p 0 001 vs glass n 3 on go substrates fig 3 d e trkc expression is increased on rgo substrates 2 86 0 29 p 0 01 vs glass n 3 while no statistical difference is observed between go substrates and the glass controls the same trend is followed by the gene expression of trkb receptor the expression of this gene is increased on rgo substrates 1 85 0 02 p 0 01 vs glass n 3 the expression of ret receptor is marginally increased on rgo substrates although not statistically significant due to the high variability of the rgo substrates the expression of this gene on go shows the same behaviour as the glass controls fig 3 f h faroni et al 24 studied the gene expression changes when ascs are differentiated towards schwann like dascs the gene expression of gdnf bdnf trkc ret nestin and vimentin markers was reported to be upregulated after the differentiation protocol compared to non differentiated asc the expression of ngf and trkb was reported to be downregulated after the differentiation protocol compared to non differentiated asc although the level of ngf protein was found to be increased in the dasc phenotype the development of a protocol that permanently differentiates asc cells into dasc is crucial to implement a stem cell based therapy strategy for peripheral nerve regeneration dasc cells were found able to express glial markers and to promote nerve regeneration myelination and to increase the speed of the conduction in the nerve 8 11 the main obstacle in the clinical translation of dasc is the maintenance of the differentiated phenotype faroni et al 24 proved that after the withdrawal of the growth factors dasc started to decrease the expression of glial markers and to reverse into asc phenotype there is consequently the need to develop better differentiation protocols and to test new materials that help maintaining the dasc phenotype even after the withdrawal of the growth factors for efficient delivery of stem cell therapies in vivo graphene and related nanomaterials have been widely reported as suitable material to support stem cell growth and differentiation 13 17 in this study the proliferation rate and the biocompatibility of these substrates were studied by two different assays and we can conclude although there is a slower proliferation rate of dasc on rgo and go substrates the amount of live cells is comparable between all the different substrates studies indicating that go and rgo substrates do not cause cytotoxicity after 48 hours importantly the analysis of gene expression of important glial markers increased after 48 hours of cellular growth on go and rgo substrates the expression of neurotrophins and their receptors is statistically increased on rgo substrates and to a lesser extent on go substrates moreover the expression of intermediate filament proteins such as nestin and vimentin is statistically increased on both and rgo substrates park et al reported increased the neuronal differentiation of neural stem cells on graphene substrates together with decreased expression of glial cells 36 the contrast between our observations and previous results from park et al can be explained by the presence of laminin on the surface of the graphene coverslips laminin is a protein of the extracellular matrix which is reported to increase neuronal differentiation of embryonic and neural stem cells 37 38 previous results on asc differentiation on go substrates 13 showed enhanced osteogenesis adipogenesis and epithelial genesis but no experiment was conducted on rgo or graphene substrates our study point out the increased glial differentiation especially on rgo substrates this is very interesting as specific properties of rgo can be exploitable in the clinical translation of dasc this is especially important for electrical conductivity as rgo compared to go is not insulating and allows the possibility of electrically stimulate stem cells even in the presence of neuronal co culture for peripheral nerve regeneration therapeutic strategy 4 conclusions our results confirm the biocompatibility of the graphene based substrates and show increased expression of neurotrophins and filament proteins mainly on rgo and go substrates these results strongly positions rgo and go coatings to be used as functional surfaces to increase glial differentiation of asc at earlier stage as the initial results on 48 hours are encouraging further studies need to be conducted to establish if the gene expression of these markers will be increased at longer time points as the entire differentiation protocol required 2 weeks of treatment funding av and afv acknowledge funding
