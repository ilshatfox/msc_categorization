need to identify existing drugs that might be suitable for treating patients suffering from covid 19 infection drugs rarely act at a single molecular target with off target effects often being responsible for undesirable side effects and sometimes beneficial synergy between targets for a specific illness off target activities have also led to blockbuster drugs in some cases e g viagra for erectile dysfunction and minoxidil for male pattern hair loss drugs already in use or in clinical trials plus approved natural products constitute a rich resource for discovery of therapeutic agents that can be repurposed for existing and new conditions based on the rationale that they have already been assessed for safety in man a key question then is how to rapidly and efficiently screen such compounds for activity against new pandemic pathogens such as covid 19 here we show how a fast and robust computational process can be used to screen large libraries of drugs and natural compounds to identify those that may inhibit the main protease of sars cov 2 3 cl pro mpro we show how the resulting shortlist of candidates with strongest binding affinities is highly enriched in compounds that have been independently identified as potential antivirals against covid 19 the top candidates also include a substantial number of drugs and natural products not previously identified as having potential covid 19 activity thereby providing additional targets for experimental validation this in silico screening pipeline may also be useful for repurposing of existing drugs and discovery of new drug candidates against other medically important pathogens and for use in future pandemics introduction the devastating impact of the covid 19 pandemic caused by sars coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 has stimulated unprecedented international activity to discover effective vaccines and drugs for this and other pathogenic coronaviruses such as sars and mers cov 1 17 computational methods offer considerable promise for determining the affinities of small drug like molecules for sars cov 2 protein targets recent papers in science have reported the application of computational de novo drug design based on the structures of the sars cov 2 protease 18 19 clearly design of potent new drugs for coronaviruses is very important for future pandemic preparedness given that the last three serious epidemics have been caused by coronaviruses however to make an impact on the current covid 19 pandemic it is only feasible to use drugs that are already registered off label use have been through at least phase 1 clinical trials to establish initial human safety or are approved natural products any covid 19 drug candidates identified in this way can then be used very quickly as their safety and pharmacokinetics should be already well understood drugs that reduce viral replication primarily by targeting viral proteases and polymerases are classified as direct acting antivirals and are the focus of the current work other studies have explored host targeted drugs that inhibit cellular functions required for viral replication and thereby inhibit sars cov 2 infection albeit with more potential for host side effects 20 the sars cov 2 genome encodes 20 proteins many of which are potential antiviral drug targets figure 1 two proteases pl pro and 3 cl pro are essential for virus replication these enzymes cleave the pp 1 a and pp 1 ab polyproteins into functional components 3 chymotrypsin like protease 3 clpro aka main protease mpro catalytically self cleaves a peptide bond between a glutamine at position p 1 and a small amino acid serine alanine or glycine at position p 1 this protease corresponds to non structural protein 5 nsp 5 the main protease in coronaviruses 3 cl protease is crucial to the processing of the coronavirus replicase polyprotein p 0 c 6 u 8 cleaving it at 11 conserved sites 3 cl protease employs a cys his catalytic dyad in its active site where the cysteine sulfur is the nucleophile and the histidine imidazole ring is a general base very recent research has shown that strong mpro inhibitors can substantially reduce sars cov 2 virus titres reduce weight loss and improve survival in mice 21 making mpro a promising drug target for structure based drug discovery figure 1 virus entry and replicative cycle mpro produces non structural proteins nsps that are essential for assembly of the viral replication transcription complex needed for rna synthesis inhibitors bind to mpro resulting in failure of virion assembly and inhibition of release of new functional virions adapted from mengist et al 22 https creativecommons org licenses by 4 0 computational methods can rapidly and efficiently identify candidate drugs for repurposing in pandemic situations where speed is of utmost importance here we used molecular docking followed by high throughput molecular dynamics simulations to prioritize from an initial large number of licensed or clinical trial drugs and natural products a short list of the most promising candidates molecular dynamics calculations were used to predict the optimal binding poses and binding energies for 84 of the top hits from docking based virtual screening to the sars cov 2 mpro finally the top candidates were ranked based on binding affinity and novelty for covid 19 repurposing results and discussion the binding energies of the 84 top ranked ligands from the docking calculations are listed in supplementary table 1 the ten drugs with the tightest binding to mpro are summarized in table 1 together with their gmxpbsa binding energies the calculated binding energy of several of the antiviral drugs namely simeprevir sofosbuvir lopinavir and ritonavir are very similar within the uncertainties in calculated energies several of the top hits were antivirals identified in other in silico docking studies or wet lab sars cov 2 activity studies this provides a degree of validation that our computational methods are appropriate and are yielding similar results to other published studies for some well studied antiviral drugs the web site drugvirus info provides a concise picture of the broad spectrum antiviral activity of a range of drugs a summary for four of the antiviral hits from our in silico screens is provided in figure 2 figure 2 spectrum of antiviral activity and nature of assessment for four antiviral hit drugs simeprevir was reported to be an inhibitor of the 3 clpro protease by abhithaj et al 23 they used a pharmacophore search followed by grid based ligand docking glide schrodinger and binding energy estimates from the mmgbsa method of 81 7 kcal mol however they did not use md to simulate the interaction of simeprevir in the 3 clpro binding site similarly sofosbuvir was reported to be a strong inhibitor of the protease by lo et al 24 using a vero e 6 cellular infection model they also reported that simeprevir was the only drug among their prioritized candidates that suppressed sars cov 2 replication at below 10 m dose response studies showed that simeprevir had an ec 50 of 4 m and cc 50 of 20 m similar to remdesivir in their experiments table 1

ritonavir were reported by bolcato et al who used supervised md to calculate the trajectories of the ligands in the protease binding site 25 costanzo and colleagues likewise reported high protease binding for these two antiviral drugs 26 they also reported updates on experimental drugs successfully employed in the treatment of the disease caused by sars cov 2 coronavirus patient recovery has been reported after treatment with lopinavir ritonavir used to treat hiv infection in combination with the anti flu drug oseltamivir muralidharan et al also used autodock another docking program similar to vina produced by the scripps group followed by md simulations using the generalised amber force field gaff in amber 16 to screen for repurposed drugs 27 they reported autodock binding energies for lopinavir oseltamivir and ritonavir of 4 1 kcal mol 4 65 kcal mol 5 11 kcal mol respectively but did not provide the binding energies from the md calculations the best known antiviral drug which has been the subject of several clinical trials for covid 19 is remdesivir 28 the potential inhibition of the protease by this drug has been reported by several computational screening studies for example al khafaji and n o n ho n o n o oh nh o o n h p o o o n n n n h 2 n ho ho o colleagues reported a combined computational docking and md study of a range of antiviral drugs to the

to 3 clpro of 113 nm using a deep learning model liu et al reported an in vitro assay that exploited the pronounced cytopathic effects of sar cov 2 on vero cells and the ability of a range of antiviral drugs to protect cells against the virus 30 in their assay remdesivir exhibited an ic 50 of 2 5 m and cc 50 of 175 m while sofosbuvir lopinavir and ritonavir were inactive similarly ma et al reported a fluorescence resonance energy transfer fret based enzymatic assay for the sars cov 2 mpro and applied it to screening a library of protease inhibitors 31 in their assay simeprivir exhibited an ic 50 of 14 3 m the most interesting potential protease inhibitors from our study are the ergot alkaloids ergotamine mergocriptine the thrombopoietin receptor agonist eltrombopag ranked 13 with gmmpbsa 28 2 kcal mol see supplementary table 1 bemcentinib pc 786 and montelukast these drugs were predicted to have better binding energies than the antiviral drugs discussed above and have a higher degree of novelty ergot drugs gurung et al reported potential binding of ergotamine to the sar cov 2 main protease in a preprint 32 the employed autodock vina but without subsequent md simulation of the complex they reported the binding energy as 9 4 kcal mol for dihydroergotamine and 9 3 kcal mol for ergotamine mevada et al also reported the in silico estimates of the binding of ergotamine to the protease using autodock vina for the virtual screening 33 they found the drug bound with an energy of 10 2 kcal mol calculated using vina no subsequent md simulation gul et al used a similar docking approach this time with md simulation and identified ergotamine and its derivatives dihydroergotamine and bromocriptine to have high binding affinity to sars cov 2 3 clpro ergotamine is an alpha 1 selective adrenergic agonist and vasoconstrictor that had a high docking binding energy against sars cov 2 mpro of 8 6 kcal mol dihydroergotamine the 9 10 alpha dihydro derivative of ergotamine showed similar high affinity of 8 6 kcal mol and bromocryptine 9 2 kcal mol ergotamine has also been predicted to bind tightly to the sars cov 2 spike s protein 34 figure 3 shows a ligplot

receptor antagonist used treat asthma and allergic rhinitis it reduces pulmonary responses to antigen tissue eosinophilia and il 5 expression in inflammatory cells and decreases elevated levels of il 1 and il 8 in viral upper respiratory tract infections 35 several computational have suggested putative binding to the terminal site of mpro montelukast has been shown to inhibit at least one other protease eosinophil protease 36 mansoor and colleagues proposed that it could bind to mpro on the basis of a simple molecular docking study 37 wu et al also reported putative binding of montelukast to mpro in a computational study using the same internal coordinate mechanics modelling methods 38 no accurate binding affinities were reported in either study figure 4 shows a ligplot representation of the interactions of key functional groups in montelukast with protease active site residues these are also listed in supplementary table 2 for reference figure 4 ligplot left and hydrophobic protein

type i interferon response it s in vitro activity against sars cov 2 has been assessed by several groups in a vero cell assay liu et al reported 10 40 protection at 50 m 30 however in an alternative assay using human huh 7 5 cells 39 bemcentinib exhibited an ic 50 of 100 nm and cc 50 of 4 7 m they also developed an assay in vero cells and reported the ic 50 was 470 nm and cc 50 was 1 6 m considerably higher activity than that reported by liu et al as a result it is an investigational treatment for covid 19 www clinicaltrialsregister eu figure 5 shows a ligplot representation of the

treatment there is very little published work on the sar cov 2 efficacy or predicting binding affinity to mpro panda and coworkers reported a binding energy gbind of pc 786 of 179 79 tighter binding than calculated for lopinavir 131 49 kj mol using a combined docking and md approach 40 like our study they employed autodock vina to dock a molecular library into the active site of mpro followed by md simulation using gromacs figure 6 shows a ligplot representation of the interactions of key functional groups in pc 786 with protease active site residues these are also listed in supplementary table 2 for reference figure 6 ligplot left and hydrophobic protein surface representation right of the main interactions between mpro and pc 786 other novel putative mpro inhibitors from the short list of 84 drugs the predicted binding energies of the 84 drugs in the short list are summarized in supplementary table 1 we have also reviewed the literature for other in silico studies that have also identified some of these hit compounds as potential mpro inhibitors and have listed experimental in vitro and in vivo results and clinical trials in progress for drugs on the list two thirds of the drugs on the list have been reported to be potential inhibitors of sars cov 2 target proteins largely mpro but also rdrp spike helicase human ace 2 2 o methyltransferase nsp 16 nsp 10 complex nsp 1 plpro nsp 3 and nsp 12 satisfyingly those with the best predicted binding affinity from our study have also been of greatest interest clinically with more in vitro assay results and clinical trials for drugs with the highest binding affinities this suggests that our screening and md simulation methods are sufficiently robust and accurate to identify drugs for repurposing against sars cov 2 and more broadly other coronaviruses the 33 of drugs in the hit list that have no reported studies are therefore also of interest as novel drugs for covid 19 we discuss some of the more interesting and novel hit compounds with higher binding affinities eltrombopag eltrombopag is a tpo agonist that acts at the transmembrane domain of its cognate receptor c mpl via a histidine residue that occurs only in humans and apes it scored highly in the docking studies suggesting it could inhibit the 3 cl protease and exhibit antiviral activity several other in silico screening studies also identified eltrombopag as a potential sars cov 2 drug feng et al s studies suggested that eltrombopag bound not only to 3 cl active site but also to the viral s protein and to human ace 2 41 this potential synergistic polypharmacy could be particularly beneficial very little has been reported on the direct antiviral activity of eltrombopag recently vogel et al reported direct inhibition of cytomegalovirus cmv by therapeutic doses of eltrombopag used to treat thrombocytopenia 42 they showed that eltrombopag inhibits the late stages of the hcmv replication cycle and reduces virus titres by 1 8 104 fold at 10 m and by 15 fold at 500 nm they suggested the mode of action was iron chelation and showed that eltrombopag was synergistic with ganciclovir in preventing viral replication eltrombopag has also been proposed as a potential drug against sars cov 2 spike protein on the basis of predicted strong binding to a pocket in the fusion cores of s 2 domain 41 eltrombopag was also identified as a high binding affinity to human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace 2 the primary binding site for the spike protein their virtual screen also used autodock vina but no subsequent md simulation was used for the top hit compounds from the screen spr was used to assess the binding of the drug to mpro figure 7 shows a ligplot representation of the interactions of key functional groups in eltrombopag with protease active site residues these are also listed in supplementary table 2 for reference figure 7 ligplot left and hydrophobic mpro protein surface representation right of the main interactions between mpro and eltrombopag and mpro eltrombopag is of particular interest as a mpro inhibitor lead because it is novel and is also a member of a large class of small molecular tpo receptor agonists that may also exhibit activity against the viral protease and potentially the spike protein and human ace 2 43 however given the clotting disorders that sar cov 2 generates the tpor agonist activities would need to be minimized to prevent platelet enhancement while retaining or enhancing the antiviral activities apart from the drugs discussed above several other drugs in the list in supplementary table 1 are of interest there are several other ergot derivatives with good predicted binding affinities to mpro metergotamine and dihydroergocristine were predicted to have dgbind of 29 and 24 kcal mol respectively other drugs with binding energies stronger than 25 kcal mol include galicaftor clinical trial for cystic fibrosis rolitetracycline broad spectrum antibiotic disogluside natural product from dioscorea nipponica makino that reduces liver chronic inflammation and fibrosis zafirlukast leukotriene receptor antagonist for asthma diosmin a natural flavone for treating venous disease azd 5991 clinical trial for relapsed or refractory haematologic malignancies and ruzasvir clinical trials for treatment of hepatitis c li et al has reported predicted mpro binding for galicaftor 44 the protease binding of rolitetracycline has been reported by durdagi et al and gul et al 45 46 zhu and corkers measured the sars cov 2 and mpro inhibition of zafirlukast 47 the ic 50 for mpro was 24 m and the ec 50 for the virus 20 m the potential of the natural product diosmin as an antiviral agent targeting mpro has also been reported in several recent computational studies 48 51 chakraborti et al reported the potential of ruzasvir as a drug against sars cov 2 although no data were provided 52 these drugs and natural products merit assessment in sar cov 2 assays and mpro inhibition experiments conclusions our virtual screening approach that applies autodock vina and md simulation in tandem to calculate binding energies for repurposed drugs has identified 84 promising compounds for treating sars cov 2 infections the screening was applied against the viral main protease mpro 3 clpro the top hits from out study consisted of a mixture of antiviral agents natural products and drugs that were developed for other applications and that have other models of action the prognostic value of our computational approach has been demonstrated by the fact that it identified a diverse range of drugs that have been reported in other computational studies or that exhibit useful sars cov 2 antiviral effects in vitro the antiviral drugs simeprevir sofosbuvir lopinavir ritonavir and remdesivir exhibit strong antiviral properties and several in in clinical trial or use against sars cov 2 these drugs have been identified as binding to mpro also by numerous virtual screening studies and by in vitro assays the more interesting and least studied lead drugs amongst our candidate list bemcentinib pc 786 montelukast ergotamine and mergocriptine were predicted to have binding affinities equal to or greater than the antiviral drugs and have also been shown to have in vitro antiviral activity against sars cov 2 a few computational studies mostly using less rigorous methods than those we employed here have also suggested that these drugs may bind to mpro this high validation success rate strongly suggests that this type of virtual screening approach is capable of identifying compounds with potentially useful activity against sars cov 2 and by analogy other coronaviruses in particular the 28 drugs for which no sars cov 2 activity has been yet reported may be of particular interest for in vitro screening the results of the current drug repurposing study provides information that could be useful to identify additional candidate drugs for testing for use in the current pandemic as well as a rational computational paradigm for identifying therapeutic agents for future viral pandemics materials and methods protein structure preparation and grid preparation the crystal structure of the covid 19 mpro figure 8 was downloaded from the rcsb pdb http www rcsb org refcode 6 y 2 f 18 figure 8 3 d structure of sars cov 2 mpro pdb refcode 6 y 2 f protein preparation and removal of non essential and non bridging water molecules for docking studies were performed using the ucsf chimera package https www cgl ucsf edu chimera 53 autodock tools adt software was used to prepare the required files for autodock vina by assigning hydrogen polarities calculating gasteiger charges to protein structures and converting protein structures from the pdb file format to pdbqt format 54 the surface area of the 3 clpro binding pocket is 335 2 volume 364 101 3 55 screening databases drugs database were downloaded from the drugbank database wishart et al 2018 and chembl database fda approved gaulton et al 2017 a total of 8773 and 13 308 drugs were retrieved from drugbank and chembl database respectively the drugs were downloaded in sdf format and converted to pdbqt format using raccoon forli et al 2016 docking methodology small molecule ligand structures were docked against protein structure using the autodock vina version 1 1 3 package 54 autodock vina employs gradient based conformational search approach and an energy based empirical scoring function autodock vina is also flexible easily scripted extensively validated in many published studies with a variety of proteins and ligands and takes advantage of large multi cpu or gpu machines to run many calculations in parallel the code has also been employed very successfully to dock millions of small molecule drug candidates into a series of protein targets to discover new potent drug leads the package includes useful scripts for generating modified pdb files required for grid calculations and for setting up the grid calculations around each protein automatically the software requires the removal of hydrogens addition of polar hydrogens setting of the correct atom types and calculation of atom charges compatible with the autogrid code the algorithm generates a grid around each protein and calculates the interaction energy of a probe noble gas atom at each grid position outside and within internal cavities of the protein the grid resolution was set to 1 the maximum number of binding modes to output was fixed at 10 and the exhaustiveness level controlling the number of independent runs performed was set at 8 the docking employed a genetic algorithm to optimize the binding conformations of the ligands during docking to the protease site drugs were docked individually to the active site of mpro 3 clpro refcode 6 y 2 f with the grid coordinates grid centre and grid boxes of appropriate sizes generated by the bash script vina screen sh supplementary information the top scored compounds were identified with a python script script 1 py supplementary information and subjected to molecular dynamic simulation the docked structures were analysed using ucsf chimera 53 and ligplot software 56 to illustrate hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions a total of fifty top compounds selected from each of the drugbank and chembl compounds sixteen compounds were common to both database top hits molecular dynamics studies were conducted on the unique set of eighty four compounds from both sets molecular dynamics simulation the top screened compound complexes with protease were minimized with charmm force field the topology files of the ligands were prepared from swissparam http www swissparam ch 57 and minimized in gromacs 2020 http www gromacs org 58 docked complexes of ligands and covid 19 mpro protein were used as starting geometries for md simulations simulations were carried out using the gpu accelerated version of the program with the charmm force field i periodic boundary conditions in oracle server docked complexes were immersed in a truncated octahedron box of tip 3 p water molecules the solvated box was further neutralized with na or cl counter ions using the tleap program particle mesh ewald pme was employed to calculate the long range electrostatic interactions the cut off distance for the long range van der waals vdw energy term was 12 0 the whole system was minimized without any restraint the above steps applied 2500 cycles of steepest descent minimization followed by 5000 cycles of conjugate gradient minimization after system optimization the md simulations was initiated by gradually heating each system in the nvt ensemble from 0 to 300 k for 50 ps using a langevin thermostat with a coupling coefficient of 1 0 ps and with a force constant of 2 0 kcal mol 2 on the complex finally a production run of 20 ns of md simulation was performed under a constant temperature of 300 k in the npt ensemble with periodic boundary conditions for each system during the md procedure the shake algorithm was applied for the constraint of all covalent bonds involving hydrogen atoms the time step was set to 2 fs the structural stability of the complex was monitored by the rmsd and rmsf values of the backbone atoms of the entire protein calculations were also performed for up to 100 ns on few compounds to ensure that 20 ns is sufficiently long for convergence duplicate production runs starting with different random seeds were also run to allow estimates of binding energy uncertainties to be determined the binding free energies of the protein protein complexes were evaluated in two ways the traditional method is to calculate the energies of solvated sars cov 2 protease and small molecule ligands and that of the bound complex and derive the binding energy by subtraction g binding aq g complex aq g protein aq g ligand aq 1 we also calculated binding energies using the molecular mechanics poisson boltzmann surface area mm pbsa tool in gromacs that is derived from the nonbonded interaction energies of the complex the method is also widely used method for binding free energy calculations mmpbsa calculations were conducted by gmxpbsa 2 159 a suite based on bash perl scripts for streamlining mm pbsa calculations on structural ensembles derived from gromacs trajectories and to automatically calculate binding free energies for protein protein or ligand protein gmxpbsa 2 1 calculates diverse mm pbsa energy contributions from molecular mechanics mm and electrostatic contribution to solvation pb and non polar contribution to solvation sa this tool combines the capability of md simulations gromacs and the poisson boltzmann equation apbs for calculating solvation energy baker et 2001 the g mmpbsa tool in gromacs was used after molecular dynamics simulations the output files obtained were used to post process binding free energies by the single trajectory mmpbsa method in the current study we considered 100 frames at equal distance from 20 ns trajectory files specifically for a non covalent binding interaction in the aqueous phase the binding free energy g bind aq is g bind aqu g bind vac g bind solv 2 where g bind vac is the binding free energy in vacuum and g bind solv is the solvation free energy change upon binding g bind solv g r l solv g r solv g l solv 3 where g r l solv g r solv and g l solv are solvation free energies of complex receptor and ligand respectively while this manuscript was in preparation guterres and im showed how substantial improvement in protein ligand docking results could be achieved using high throughput md simulations 60 as with our study they also employed autodock vina for docking followed by md simulation using charmm the md parameters they advocated were very similar to those used in our study proteins were solvated in a box of tip 3 p water molecules extending 10 beyond the proteins and the particle mesh ewald method was used for electrostatic interactions nonbonded interactions over 10 and 12 were truncated their systems were minimized for 5000 steps using the steepest descent method followed by 1 ns equilibration with an nvt setting for each protein ligand complex they ran 3 100 ns production runs from the same initial structure using different initial velocity random seeds and an integration step size of 2 fs over 56 protein targets of 7 different protein classes and 560 ligands this show 22 improvement in the area under receiver operating characteristics curve
