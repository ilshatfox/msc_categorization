spike conformation transition in sars cov 2 infection liaofu luo college of physical sciences inner mongolia university hohhot china yongchun zuo college of life sciences inner mongolia university hohhot china correspondence address lolfcm imu edu cn abstract a theory on the conformation transition for sars cov 2 spike protein s is proposed the conformation equilibrium between open up and closed down conformations of receptor binding domain rbd of the spike is studied from the first principle the conformational state population is deduced from the free energy change in conformation transition of s protein we demonstrated that the free energy includes two parts one from the multi minima of conformational potential and another from the variation of structural elasticity both factors are dependent of amino acid mutation the former is related to the change of affinity of rbd to ace 2 due to the mutation in the subdomain rbm receptor binding motif of rbd the latter is caused by the change of elastic energy of s protein when the affinity has increased significantly and or the elastic energy has been reduced substantially the equilibrium is biased to the open conformation only then can the virus infection process continue possible new sars cov 2 variants from amino acid mutations in 5 9 sites on rbd interface are predicted the elastic energy variation needed for conformation transition is estimated quantitatively taking the elastic structural change into account more virus variants are possible both the d 614 g mutation the k 986 p mutation and the new variants 501 y in current sars cov 2 pandemic can be interpreted from the presented theory the comparison of the infectivity of sars cov 2 with sars cov 1 is made from the point of conformation equilibrium why the virus entrance takes priority in lower temperature and higher humidity is interpreted by the present theory the conformational transition influenced by electromagnetic field is also discussed briefly 1 introduction the current sars cov 2 pandemic has created urgent needs for diagnostics therapeutics and vaccines however meeting these needs firstly requires a deep understanding of the mechanism of viral infection for all enveloped viruses membrane fusion is a key early step for entering host cells and establishing infection the surface of coronaviruses are decorated with a spike s protein about 1273 amino acids for sars cov 2 a large class 1 fusion protein the s protein forms a trimeric complex that can be functionally categorized into two distinct subunits s 1 and s 2 subunits there is a receptor binding domain rbd in s 1 between sequence sites 331 to 528 for sars cov 2 which interacts with a host cell receptor protein to trigger membrane fusion the host cell receptors for sars cov and mers cov are angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace 2 and dpp 4 respectively 1 2 recent advances in cryo electron microscopy cryo em characterization of the spike protein revealed that the rbds adopted at least two distinct conformations rbd can be either in the open or in the closed position called up or down conformation respectively 3 in the up conformation the rbd jut out away from the rest of s such that they can easily bind with ace 2 in the down conformation the rbds are tightly packed preventing binding by ace 2 4 the receptor binding event may trap the rbd in the less stable up conformation leading to destabilization of s 1 triggering the conformational change of s 2 from prefusion to postfusion state and initiating the membrane fusion the sars cov cell entry also depends on transmembrane protease serine 2 tmprss 2 etc which help to cut s to units s 1 and s 2 5 the above conformational transition processes can be expressed through a set of equations rbd closed rbd open 1 rbd open 2 ace as 2 1 2 s e s s e 2 2 s prefus s postfus 3 where as in eq 2 denotes the rbd receptor bound state eq 3 is a set of equations causing the transition of s protein from prefusion to postfusion state and in its first equation e denotes the enzyme tmprss 2 the di directional transition of eq 1 makes rbd attaining at an equilibrium between open and closed conformations eq 1 is the starting point of the viral infection we shall focus on it in the paper 2 method mathematical relation of conformation equilibrium eq 1 describes the conformation transition of rbd the closed open transition of rbd proceeds in two directions the equilibrium of which determines the first step of viral infection we shall study the conformation equilibrium between rbd closed and rbd open suppose a denotes closed conformation and b open conformation the gibbs free energy is expressed by ga and gb respectively in two conformations generally if ga is lower than the gb then s 1 takes inactive conformation a with large probability as the spike protein located in this structure the subsequent steps of eqs 2 and 3 will not start and the virus infectious process cannot continue oppositely in order to start eq 2 the equilibrium of eq 1 should be biased to the right open conformation that is gb should be lower than ga the free energy g in a given conformation is related to the partition function z ln 1 n b e n b g k t z z e k t 4 where en is the energy level in the conformation and the sum in eq 4 is over the quantum states n 6 thus we have the free energy increase g gb ga as ln b b a z g k t z 5 g determines the conformational state population g 0 means conformation a more populated and g 0 b more populated set en for the molecule in conformation a or b is denoted by en a or en b respectively 1 2 n a b a b a b e v n 6 where va b is the conformational energy for the molecule in state a or b which is determined by two minima of conformational potential respectively and 1 2 a b n the corresponding vibrational energy around the minimum of conformational potential called elastic energy hereafter by the summation of boltzmann factor over vibration states one has 7 1 a b a b a b v v b z z ye k t 7 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 a b b b a a e e e e y 8 since the partition function is derived from the summation of boltzmann factor za zb given by eq 7 means the conformational state population the ratio of the probabilities in two conformations a and b it shows that if the vibration is neglected then the population is simply determined by the symbol of va vb for example a is the advantageous conformation as va vb however equation 7 shows that the vibrations around the minimum of potential are important for the conformational state population in fact from eq 8 one has a s a b b a b b a y k t 8 1 exp as 2 a b b a b a b b y k t k t 8 2 in general ya b 1 and decreasing monotonously with t as a b 0 ya b 1 and increasing monotonously with t as a b 9 inserting 8 into 7 we have g econf eelas econf vb va eelas kbtlnya b 10 the right hand side of eq 10 contains two parts econf describes the conformational energy and related term eelas describes the elastic energy thus by taking the elastic energy into account the conformation with lower vibration frequency increases its probability when b is much smaller than a in spite of va vb one always has za zb 1 and the conformation b is the advantageous with large probability instead of a see sketch map of conformational potential fig 1 another relation can be used in estimating the elastic energy term ya b is ln ctnh 1 2 2 b a a a b b a b b a k t y as k t 11 where the function ctnhx is defined by an odd function decreasing with x and always larger than 1 for positive x consider amino acid mutations in spike the single amino acid mutation causes changes both in conformational energy ecomf and elastic energy eelas there are two ways to make conformation transition from closed to open one is decrease of conformational energy ecomf and another is reduce of elastic energy eelas as g 0 we have zb za 0 and the equilibrium between two conformations shifts to the side of conformation b otherwise as g 0 the equilibrium remains tend to the conformation a 3 results the conformational potential and structural elasticity of spike protein is dependent of its amino acid sequence one may increase or decrease the conformational and elastic energy through amino acid mutation therefore the ctnh x x x x e e x e e originally inactive conformation up can transform into an active advantageous down by selecting appropriate amino acid mutation recently the deep mutational scanning of sars cov 2 rbd was completed and its constraints on folding and ace 2 binding were analyzed 8 however how the mutation influences the conformation equilibrium and in turn influences the virus infection has not been studied in the following we will sketch the main results of our method for explaining experimental facts 3 1 amino acid mutations at rbd ace 2 interface the transition from closed to open conformation can occur by decreasing conformational energy conf e v v b a through amino acid mutation it can be attained through the mutational change of affinity for about 20 residues at rbd ace 2 interface in the subdomain rbm receptor binding motif see table 1 the affinity given in the table is the value relative to unmutated variant we found for most mutational sites at interface the affinity change takes a negative value however they take a large positive affinity at several sites that predicts a possible conformational transition we predict the amino acid mutations with higher affinity and higher expression as new variants of sars cov 2 as shown in the table we found that there are nine sites where the amino acid mutation possibly leads to the conformation transition of sars cov 2 and five of which namely at site 501 498 493 503 and 484 respectively require special attention the predicted mutation n 501 y has been observed in the variant 20 b 501 y v 1 or b 1 1 7 in u k the variant 20 c 501 y v 2 or b 1 351 in south africa and the lineage b 1 1 248 in brazil the predicted mutation e 484 k has been observed in the variant 20 c 501 y v 2 in south africa 9 table 1 affinity change at rbd ace 2 interface in amino acid mutation

affinity to ace 2 is represented by logkp relative to the unmutated sars cov 2 rbd where kp is dissociation constant 8 the sum of all positive affinities for amino acid mutation on the site is given in the second line and none means none mutation with positive affinity the predicted variants in the third line are selected according to the conditions logkp 0 05 and expression logmfi 0 2 where mfi mean fluorescence intensity 8 the amino acid replacement in sars cov 1 is given in the fourth line and the affinity for that replacement is given in the fifth line 3 2 amino acid mutations outside rbm subdomain d 614 g mutation in the following three sections we will adduce evidence to show that the conformation transition occurs through the approach of elastic energy change there is strong evidence that the spike protein mutation d 614 g increases infectivity of the covid 19 virus and the g 614 variant has become the most prevalent form in the global pandemic 10 how to explain this important event in the virus evolution the recent analysis on the structure and function of the d 614 g spike protein indicated that although the d 614 g affinity for ace 2 is reduced the conformation can still be shifted towards an ace 2 binding competent state 11 this is consistent with our conformation equilibrium theory mentioned above since the mutation d 614 g removes the h bond between residues d 614 in s 1 and t 859 in s 2 and the rbd structural elasticity has been changed and the flexibility has been increased for the wild type spike the rbd is in closed conformation a where va is lower than vb however the elasticity decreases largely due to amino acid replacement and the conformation b changes to the advantageous one it means the amino acid mutation triggers the transition of rbd from a closed to a more open conformation the open rbd will be able to initiate the subsequent processes following eq 2 and eq 3 and consequently the spike protein changes itself from prefusion to postfusion states to mediate fusion of viral and cellular membrane this interprets why the mutation d 614 g largely increases the infectivity of the covid 19 virus k 986 p mutation in recent mrna vaccine design people demonstrated that mrna expressing sars cov 2 s 2 p is a potent immunogen they identified 2 proline substitutions 2 p at the apex of the central helix and heptal repeat 1 hr 1 that effectively stabilized mers cov and sars cov proteins in the prefusion conformation 12 the prefusion stabilized protein immunogens that preserve neutralization sensitive epitopes are an effective vaccine strategy for enveloped viruses here the key step is the 2 p mutation k 986 p and v 987 p in sars cov 2 spike sequence the k 986 p mutation removes a salt bridge between lys 986 and either asp 427 or asp 428 of another protomer in the trimer interface 2 the mutation relaxes the structure of s protein that is due to the mutation the structural elasticity of the spike decreases and in turn it jumps from the closed conformation a to the open conformation b since b is an easily infectious conformation the k 986 p mutation provides an immunogen design that can trigger immediate rapid manufacturing of an mrna vaccine several commonly studied amino acid variants related to spike elastic energy above two examples show that apart from conformational energy related mutations in rbm subdomain the amino acid mutations in other spike regions also trigger the conformation transition these mutations are related to the elasticity change of the spike the spike elastic energy plays important role in studying sars cov 2 infection several commonly studied amino acid mutations in the spike regions outside rbm subdomain are listed in table 2 the global frequencies of these amino acid variants are given in the table and the corresponding free energy change due to elastic energy are also estimated and listed in the table table 2 amino acid variants related to spike elastic

positive experimental data of mutations 1 7 are taken from 10 data of mutation 8 are taken from 2 12 data of mutations 9 and 10 are taken from 9 g kbt in the last column is calculated by using eq 5 where za zb is taken from the experimental count of population the lower bound of count in mutations 8 is estimated from thermostable spike trimer where about 80 of s r pp trimmers have one open rbd 13 the mutations 9 and 10 are associated with n 501 y in the variant b 1 1 7 where the separate effect of elastic energy has not been defined quantitatively section 3 3 from table 2 we found the free energy increase g of open conformation relative to closed is positive in most mutations apart from d 614 g k 986 p p 681 h and 69 70 del it explains why a substantial number of mutations have not been selected in current sars cov 2 pandemic isolates moreover table 2 indicates g kbt always takes a positive value near 1 or takes a negative value near 5 for all mutations the large negative value means the amino acid mutation having not brought any obvious change of elastic energy so that g is dominated by vb va term and remains positive while the former case of positive value means the amino acid mutation makes the elastic energy of open conformation much lower than the closed conformation so that g changes to negative how to explain the relation between the amino acid mutation and the change of spike elasticity we know that 20 amino acid residues are classified into three categories the acid residues as anions d e and y the basic residues as cations h k and r and others neutral residues one may assume a significant change of elastic energy can be found only if the residue s electric charge difference in the mutation is 1 unit or more and otherwise the elastic energy variation is too small so that the mutation cannot trigger the structural changes of s protein from the experimental data in tab 2 we know that in the former case g kbt takes a positive value near 1 and in the latter case g kbt takes a negative value near 5 therefore the electricity change in the mutation determines the elasticity change of the spike and finally determine which one open or closed is the advantageous conformation of rbd 3 3 new variant strains 501 y the new variant 20 b 501 y v 1 or b 1 1 7 emerged in the fall of 2020 9 apart from d 614 g it includes the mutation n 501 y in rbd the spike deletion 69 70 del and the mutation p 681 h adjacent to the furin cleavage site the mutation n 501 y contributes a large positive value of affinity and beneficial to conformation transition from closed to open the deletion 69 70 in association with other rbd changes may relax the spike structure and decrease the elastic energy the mutation p 681 h is immediately adjacent to the furin cleavage site which may help the s protein cut to s 1 and s 2 under the enzyme action all these factors are superimposed together and make the new variant strain emerging with an unusually high growth rate the variant was firstly detected in the u k with high infectivity and rapidly detected in numerous countries around the world later another variant 20 c 501 y v 2 in south africa and another lineage b 1 1 248 in brazil were reported independently both they include the mutation n 501 y in rbd besides the mutant e 484 k was detected in 20 c 501 y v 2 which has a strong ability to escape from neutralizing antibodies that may be related to the gene network of immune escape 13 3 4 more conformations of virus s protein three conformations of the prefusion trimer observed by using cryo electron microscopy on intact virions all rbds in the closed position one rbd in the open position and two rbds in the open position 3 however the two open conformation has only been observed in vitro after inserting multiple stabilizing mutations moreover through the designed mutations in s protein these authors observed distinct closed and locked conformations of the s trimer and the classification of the cryo em data showed that the disulfide bond formation is beneficial to the closed rbds 14 the above experimental data can be explained as well by our model disulfide bond is a strong bond the disulfide bond formation gives another factor to tighten the s protein structure in addition to commonly the h bond and salt bridge following the present model the multiple stabilizing mutations can be explained by the conformational potential u of three or more minima the generalized multi minima can describe the abundant structures of s protein and many new conformations of rbd appeared in the experiment any change of the vibration frequency around one minimum will give additional contribution to the free energy of the prefusion trimer the conformation equilibrium among multi minima will provide a starting point for the study of the phase transition dynamics of the system 4 discussions 4 1 conformational equilibrium of spike protein in amino acid mutation the conformational change of the spike protein is of special significance for virus infection to understand the virus entry and viral infection one needs know how the conformational equilibrium of the spike protein takes place and how the amino acid mutation changes the equilibrium we found that the sars cov 2 infection of humans and its pandemic is always through the amino acid mutation on the spike one approach is the binding affinity of rbd to ace 2 increasing due to the amino acid mutation in the subdomain rbm another approach is the elastic energy reduction due to the change of the structure for example the loss of some hydrogen bonds or salt bonds of the spike protein the former is related to the change of conformational potential energy vb va while the latter is related to the variation of conformational vibration frequency difference a b or frequency ratio a b we found there exist several amino acid mutations on rbd interface that may produce the new sars cov 2 variants see table 1 the elastic energy variation needed for conformation transition can be estimated as follows from table 2 we found that as the amino acid mutation does not cause the breaking of hydrogen bond or salt bond the free energy difference g between closed and open conformations is about 5 kbt while as the amino acid mutation causes the break of hydrogen bond or salt bond g is near 1 kbt the difference 6 kbt between two cases should come from the elastic energy variation therefore the hydrogen bond salt bond break in spike protein generally needs energy input about 6 kbt 0 15 ev which gives reasonable order of magnitude estimate 4 2 comparison of conformation equilibrium in sars cov 2 and in sars cov 1 why does sars cov 2 infect humans so easily deep mutational scanning of all amino acid mutations gives new understanding on the problem suggesting that there is a substantial mutational space consistent with sufficient affinity to maintain human infectivity 8 rbd ace 2 interface is a region where amino acids are prone to mutation the evolutionary conservatism between two interfaces of sars cov 2 and sars cov 1 is 40 lower than the conservatism 79 for the total genome comparison the affinity comparison between sars cov 2 and sars cov 1 are given in table 1 there are 12 mutational sites in total in the subdomain rbm three sites at 498 501 and 503 showing nearly equal affinity and other nine sites of sars cov 2 having higher affinity than sars cov 1 it means that on average sars cov 2 rbd binds ace 2 stronger than sars cov 1 this is the first reason why the infectivity of sars cov 2 is higher than sars cov 1 when we study how the amino acid mutation influences the virus infectivity we should consider the contribution from structural elasticity variation in the total rbd comparing rbd sequences between sars cov 1 and sars cov 2 we found there are 49 single amino acid mutations in total and fourteen of them have the electric charge variation of 1 unit these mutations indicate that the variation of structural elasticity of the spike does exist in the evolution of sars cov 1 and sars cov 2 moreover we found eight mutations from sars cov 1 to sars cov 2 namely e 354 n r 439 n k 452 l y 455 l d 476 g k 478 t d 494 s and y 498 q are of charge decreasing type from charge negative or positive to neutral and six mutations v 417 k n 460 k v 471 e f 473 y p 484 e and n 519 h are of electric charge increasing type from charge neutrality to negative or positive it can be roughly estimated that the elasticity decreasing mutations occurred about 14 more in sars cov 2 than in sars cov 1 evolution this is the second reason to explain the infectivity of sars cov 2 higher than sars cov 1 from the point of conformation equilibrium 4 3 conformational transition induced by electromagnetic field as shown in fig 1 there is a potential barrier between two conformations the transmission coefficient is dependent of the height and width of the potential barrier introducing an electric field will change the conformational barrier of the spike effectively and in turn change the conformational state population it was reported that as the electric field increases beyond 0 02 au the net electron density starts to move from c h bond towards the carbon causing the bond to begin to weaken and lengthen thus the static electric field of appropriate strength and direction can break some h bond and salt bond in the spike and changes the conformation equilibrium of rbd on the other hand the geomagnetic field can effectively block the bombardment of high energy charged particles in the cosmic ray due to abnormal macula activity the weakened geomagnetic field would make the spike susceptible to bombardment causing the residue deletion or amino acid mutation and changing the conformational state population 4 4 equilibrium between rbd closed and open conformations correlated with temperature and humidity conformational equilibrium of rbd is dependent of temperature that can be seen from eqs 7 and 8 from eq 9 we know that ya b depends on temperature monotonously decreasing with t as a b and increasing with t as a b define the phase transition temperature tc tc is determined by g 0 from eqs 10 11 we obtain a simplified equation for tc 2 2 b a a a b b c v v ctnh k t 12 eq 12 gives a curve on 2 b a a b v v y 2 a b k t x plane that divides the plane into two phases closed conformation and open conformation under given parameters va vb a and b when the environmental temperature decreases to t tc the conformational transition from closed conformation to open occurs immediately this explains why the virus entrance takes priority in the winter oppositely the best time to eliminate the virus is in summer apart from temperature the conformational equilibrium depends on humidity it was reported that the soluble s trimer with the pp mutation has a looser structure than the full length s with wild type sequence 2 so the moisture may be conductive to k 986 p mutation and makes the virus infectious in fact the virus can be modeled as a charged sphere from the electrostatics for salty solution one can arrive at an expression for the potential at the surface of the charged sphere and the dielectric constant has entered into the expression of the potential 15 it means the elastic frequency 2 should be replaced by 2 for water 80 therefore the frequency parameter takes a reduced value 9 in the full salty solution instead of in vacuum in this way we estimate the elastic frequency should be reduced by a multiple up to 9 in the humid environment this gives a quantitative estimate on the virus infection strongly dependent of humidity references 1 wrapp d et al structural basis for potent neutralization of betacoronaviruses by
