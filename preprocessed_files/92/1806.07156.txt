video rate the plasmon ruler consists of two gold nanospheres connected by a single protein linker in our experiment we follow the dynamics of the molecular chaperon hsp 90 heat shock protein 90 which is known to show an open and a closed conformation our measurements confirm the previously known conformational dynamics with transition times in the second to minute timescale and reveals new dynamics on the timescale of minutes to hours plasmon rulers thus extend the observation bandwidth 3 4 orders of magnitude with respect to single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer fret and enable the study of molecular dynamics with unprecedented precision keywords plasmon ruler single molecule hsp 90 protein dynamics non ergodicity 3 the function of proteins is determined by a combination of their structure and dynamics acquisition of structural information has recently been revolutionized by advances in electron microscopy 1 2 however protein dynamics is difficult to obtain over long timescales 3 here we show a novel plasmon ruler based single molecule approach to study the conformational dynamics of single proteins over 24 hours at video rate in and out of equilibrium i e in the absence and presence of atp this approach does not impose external force on the proteins and allows to measure protein dynamics over several orders of magnitude which cannot be achieved by the established single molecule techniques 4 5 6 we used this technique to explore the dynamics of the heat shock protein 90 hsp 90 and find beside the well known fast dynamics in the 0 1 10 s range states with very long dwell times linked to rarely visited states in the minute timescale which could indicate for instance pathways to protein denaturation our plasmon ruler based method will enable to access the full complexity of correlated local and global conformational dynamics on the level of individual proteins and therefore extend and complement the current structure function paradigm with a novel structure timescale function description access to the dynamics of a single protein over more than 6 orders of magnitude further allows us to address important questions like conformational heterogeneity among proteins ergodic behavior and non markovian dynamics ultimately extending the often static view of biomolecules with a more dynamic picture light induces the collective oscillation of the conduction electrons in noble metal nanoparticles with a specific resonance frequency called particle plasmon 7 a plasmon ruler consists of two plasmonic e g gold nanoparticles bridged by the macromolecule under investigation figure 1 a inset see supplementary information and figures s 1 and s 2 for the nanoparticle preparation characterization and optimization of the assembly the coupling of the plasmons of the two nanoparticles depends strongly on their separation decreasing the interparticle distance shifts the plasmon resonance to higher wavelengths red shift with an additional increase of the scattering efficiency figure 1 a and s 3 by continuously monitoring the scattering intensity of hundreds of single particle pairs plasmon rulers in parallel under a dark field microscope we determine the interparticle distance and thus reveal the dynamics of the bridging 4 macromolecule 8 9 figure 1 a and s 3 plasmonic nanoparticles offer the possibility to access a wide range of timescales because of their unlimited photostability and exceptionally strong light scattering these properties allow us to measure for in principle infinite time with microsecond time resolution see the supporting information for a discussion of the limits of plasmon ruler dynamical measurements figures s 4 s 5 and s 6 and tables s 1 and s 2 plasmon rulers have been used to study dna molecules and their interactions with proteins 10 13 simple polymers 14 and can even be extended to study three dimensional motions 15 until now plasmon rulers have not been used to study conformational dynamics of more complex macromolecules such as proteins here we report key technical and methodological advances in time resolution nanoparticle functionalization and measurement parallelization that permitted us to follow the dynamics of single proteins for up to 24 hours at video rate 20 hz figure 1 b and s 7 figure 1 c shows an exemplary long time trace from a single molecule from this one single time trace a complete dynamic state model and its transition rates can be deduced previously experiments with single molecule fret yielded time traces of around 100 seconds requiring the pooling of hundreds of single protein traces to extract transition rates pooling of traces from different molecules implies ergodicity and the absence of additional dwell times on timescales more than about a factor of two larger than the trace length this study on the molecular chaperone hsp 90 shows that these assumptions have to be revisited we use the hsp 90 as our model system because it has been extensively studied by fret x ray crystallography and electron microscopy 16 19 the hsp 90 protein forms homo dimers stably connected through the two c terminal domains and temporarily through the n terminal domains the protein complex undergoes scissor like conformational changes where the n terminus is open or closed 16 we sandwiched a single hsp 90 complex between two gold nanospheres in a microfluidic flow cell in our deposition strategy one gold nanoparticle serving as anchor was attached to the glass slide then a second particle was attached to the anchor particle with an hsp 90 complex bridging the two as schematically represented in the inset of figure 1 a we use polyethylene glycol peg for the passivation of the flow cell surface and the nanoparticles as well as molecular linker for the protein nanoparticle connection see details 5 and controls in the supplementary information figures s 2 s 4 s 5 and s 6 our assembly strategy results in plasmon rulers linked by a single functioning hsp 90 complex some plasmon rulers in the field of view usually around 10 show the telltale signature of the hsp 90 complex known from fret experiments 16 19 two distinct conformations open closed with transitions in the second timescale see figure 1 c and 2 a b the mean distance change 4 7 0 4 nm agrees well with the value of 5 2 nm expected from available structures for this mutant 285 c 285 c which reads 14 1 nm in the open state 20 and 8 9 nm in the closed state 21 as additional control we add the non hydrolyzable atp analogue amp pnp at the end of the experiment which is known to lock the protein in the closed state 19 which we also observe here figure 2 c all these observations make us confident that the plasmon rulers indeed capture the conformational dynamics of a single hsp 90 dimer we excluded any influence from the gold nanoparticles on the natural conformational dynamics of hsp 90 first for 60 nm gold spheres the diffusion time is around 0 1 s for a distance change of 1 nm this diffusion time is around six orders of magnitude faster than the faster hsp 90 dynamics which is in the range of 0 1 second we assume that it is possible to measure protein s conformational dynamics slower than this diffusion time second the hsp 90 mutant was selected to avoid any interference or steric hindrance with the gold spheres third the obtained hsp 90 dynamics from the plasmon rulers is in good agreement with the fret measurements in the 1 to 100 seconds range however the plasmon ruler traces show dynamics never seen before by fret dynamics on the 1 10 min timescale figure 2 a and even molecules that remain in either the open or closed configuration for several hours figure 2 d and s 7 such long lived states were not observed for plasmon rulers connected only by peg linkers figure s 5 we compare these plasmon ruler traces outside of the regions where they remain in one state for extended period of time to previous fret studies using an analysis based on a hidden markov model with four states 22 figure 2 e depicts the four states from the viterbi path in different colors in general the rates extracted from the plasmon rulers agree well with the fret data figure s 8 what is missing from the fret data are long lived states we first quantify states with an intermediate occupancy 6 in the minute timescale for this analysis we selected traces or parts of traces that are not stuck in one state for hours and converted them into a series of dwell times corresponding to the time spent in the open and closed conformation in total we obtained 27700 transitions in the absence of atp and 33000 transitions in the presence of atp figure 3 the cumulative occurrence p t data shows linear regions on a negative logarithmic axis for dwell times in the hundreds of second region which indicates another long lived sub state within the open and closed conformation the lifetimes of these previously unknown states are between four and five minutes for the open conformation and one to two minutes for the closed conformation with atp reducing the lifetime in the closed conformation table s 3 these unexpected long lived states especially those on the hour timescale clearly show the need to observe single molecules for extremely long periods in this system even 24 hours are not sufficient to ensure ergodicity 23 in an ergodic system statistical properties from transitions within a single molecule trace or from the same amount of transitions from different molecules yield the same result however we still find differences for example of the total time spend in the open configuration between 24 hour traces figures s 7 and s 9 ergodicity is an assumption generally taken in the single molecule field 24 which needs to be revisited in the light of these results the long lived states could correspond to misfolded protein domains this would fit well with the findings from optical tweezer experiments that domain unfolding at zero force occurs on the timescale of hours and that the generally very fast refolding is often hindered by long lived misfolded states for the full length multi domain hsp 90 protein 25 26 the analysis of these transitions within the hsp 90 molecule shows the capability of plasmon rulers to find conformational dynamics at both fast and slow timescales from one single protein complex the accessible bandwidth is paralleled only by electrophysiological measurements on single ion channels with the patch clamp technique which led groundbreaking discoveries in the 1990 s 27 not only the bandwidth is remarkable also the signal to noise level is at least a factor of four better at comparable time resolution than single molecule fret figure s 10 the versatility and simplicity of plasmon rulers as tool to study single protein conformational dynamics makes it possible to study slow and rare processes such as protein 7 misfolding and denaturation or the complex conformational changes after or during the interaction with other proteins or small molecules comparing single molecule traces will show the dynamical effects of the variability non ergodicity of nominally identical protein species caused for example by small differences in the secondary or tertiary structure or post translational modifications more fundamentally long single molecule traces open the window to investigate memory effects non markovian behavior and directionality detailed balance 23 associated content supplementary information containing protein

non functional dimers and functional dimers the additional particles are small nanoparticle aggregates or impurities and defects of the flowcell measurement conditions we used for all the experiments the hepes buffer containing 40 mm hepes 50 mm kcl 10 mm mgcl 2 at ph 7 4 supplemented with without atp as specified after carrying out the experiment with 5 mm or without atp and observing the thermally induced fluctuations we incubated our plasmon rulers with the same buffer supplemented with 2 mm amp pnp the non hydrolizable atp analog amp pnp is known to lock the hsp 90 complex in the closed state after the complete exchange of the buffer in the flow cell we started to record a new timetrace 6 microscope setup the dark field setups used plan apochromat 40 x 1 3 zeiss objectives and a superk extreme supercontinuum laser with a superk select multi line tunable filter nkt photonics or fixed wavelength led 623 nm as light source for the automated data acquisition hamamatsu orca flash v 4 0 and data analysis we used a matlab based software after the data acquisition we corrected the baseline of our time traces by low pass filtering and normalized the signal to its mean conversion of intensity to distance we estimate the equilibrium interparticle distance d 0 for our hsp 90 plasmon ruler peg hsp 90 peg to be approximately d 0 19 nm 16 9 nm in the closed state and 22 nm in the open using the known dimensions of hsp 90 8 9 nm 14 nm and peg linkers 4 nm by using boundary element method 8 bem we estimated the spectral response of our plasmon rulers to changes in the interparticle distance figure s 3 a the scattering intensity irel d at a given wavelength 0 normalized to the intensity measured at the estimated equilibrium particle separation d 0 19 nm decreases with increasing interparticle separation d figure s 3 b around the equilibrium particle separation d 0 the function irel d shows a nearly linear relationship purple line figure s 3 b inset within the maximum range of expected interparticle distances about 15 23 nm this linear approximation works well figure s 3 c inset we use the slope of this line to convert relative intensity changes irel to interparticle distance changes d d w irel for three different wavelength 0 615 nm 625 nm 635 nm we extract w 27 6 w 24 5 and w 24 3 respectively given all of the uncertainties in this conversion peg linker length exact sizes of the nanoparticles in a given dimer etc we believe that w 25 is a reasonable conversion factor to convert relative intensity to distance changes we like to stress that it is much easier to interpret the time evolution of the relative signal intensities compared to the absolute values for the measured distances which have a large systematic error similar to most other single molecule techniques figure s 3 conversion of scattering intensity to interparticle distance a simulated scattering spectra for different interparticle distance d in the simulations the gold spheres had a diameter of 62 nm and were surrounded by a medium with a refractive index n 1 34 we used tabulated optical constants for gold b relative intensity changes at a fixed wavelength 0 as a function of interparticle distance d at the equilibrium distance of our plasmon rulers d 0 19 nm the relative intensity depends approximately linear on d with a slope of w 25 inset 7 setup performance and principal limits for plasmon rulers the measured fluctuations of the signal obtained from a single plasmon ruler are caused both by measurement noise 1 and by real interparticle distance changes 2 1 the light sources optics and detectors lead to a fluctuating signal level which we refer to as setup noise the fundamental reason for this noise is the statistical nature of light which is made from a discrete number of photons on top of this photon shot noise there is noise in the detector and it is analog to digital converter also the light emission and collection efficiency might not be completely stable over time for example by small changes in the focus position drift 2 when we measure plasmon rulers connected by hsp 90 we observe an increased fluctuation amplitude compared to the above mentioned setup noise these fluctuations are real in the sense that they are caused by changes in the interparticle distance d part of this additional fluctuation is due to the peg spacers the linker contribution another part is due to the stiffness of the hsp 90 linker itself the hsp 90 contribution on top of both of these additional fluctuation sources the hsp 90 shows the distinct transitions between the open and closed conformation the topic of this work in this context the above mentioned linker and hsp 90 contributions are noise even though part of it contains information about molecular dynamics we characterized the contribution of both the setup noise of our current setups which is of course dependent on exposure time and the amount of available light and the contribution from the linker linker contribution and the hsp 90 molecule itself as a measure of the different contribution to the fluctuating signal we use here the standard deviation of the signal over a given period of time 10 min we estimate these contributions on several long 24 hours timetraces and report the average of the obtained values and their standard deviation if we try to estimate the resolution of the plasmon rulers for detecting conformational changes of macromolecules we need also to consider the time resolution and bandwidth of the measurement on the other hand longer measurements have additional sources of noise drift on the other hand reducing the time resolution increasing exposure time decreases all statistical noise in the section distance resolution we give a few examples of the ability of plasmon rulers to report distance changes on various timescales at the end we discuss in the section limits of plasmon rulers what causes noise on a fundamental level and how much the distance resolution could be improved 8 setup noise to estimate the setup noise we measured gold nanorods with approximately the same scattering intensity as our plasmon rulers figure s 4 these nanorods consist of a solid rod shaped nanoparticle which prohibits any fluctuations coming from interparticle distance variations the remaining signal fluctuations are therefore caused by the measurement process itself probably because of noise in the camera and the light source these rod shaped particles have a fluctuation amplitude of around 0 28 0 10 over 10 min reducing the exposure time to 1 s 10 s by averaging 10 100 data points the fluctuation amplitude reduces to 0 21 0 10 0 17 0 08 respectively figure s 4 time traces of nanoparticles without soft linker these time traces were measured on particles that are not connected by soft linkers on these particles nothing should be changing over time so that the signal variation is caused only by noise in the measurement itself we show a zoom of 10 min in a the entire 24 hours measurement in b c additional traces of different gold nanorods we evaluate the signal variation over 10 min with the full time resolution 100

contribution to estimate the linker contribution we substituted the hsp 90 protein dimer by a dithiol poly ethylene glycol 5 kda rapp polymere gmbh figure s 5 shows some examples of such peg linked plasmon rulers measured with 100 ms time resolution these peg dimers have a fluctuation amplitude of around 0 80 0 62 over 10 min reducing the exposure time to 1 s 10 s by averaging 10 100 data points the fluctuation amplitude reduces to 0 64 0 58 0 53 0 49 respectively figure s 5 time traces of peg connected plasmon rulers time traces of plasmon rulers connected by peg molecules zoom of 10 min in

resolution medium light blue and 10 s time resolution light blue c f histograms in a right side the observed signal variation of 0 8 is caused in part by the peg linkers 10 hsp 90 contribution plasmon rulers connected by hsp 90 show a larger fluctuation amplitude than peg connected dimers presumably due to the lower rigidity of hsp 90 compared to peg in the given buffer conditions see figure s 6 this hsp 90 contribution is not caused by the opening or closing of the hsp 90 dimers which show much larger and clearly distinct fluctuations it is not clear to us why some or most of the hsp 90 linkers do not show the opening closing behavior in some cases there could be multiple linkers between the two nanoparticles but it is unlikely that this is the only reason for this behavior it is possible that our plasmon ruler preparation procedure denatures many hsp 90 molecules in a way that make them unable to show the opening closing transition these hsp 90 dimers have a fluctuation amplitude of around 1 98 0 87 over 10 min reducing the exposure time to 1 s 10 s by averaging 10 100 data points the fluctuation amplitude reduces to 1 85 0 89 1 69 0 92 respectively figure s 6 time

light green and 10 s time resolution gray c f histograms in a right side the observed signal variation of 2 is caused in part by the hsp 90 molecule 11 examples of measurement resolution in the above control experiments we have determined the fluctuation amplitude measured with different time resolution and over different periods of time the results are summarized in table s 1 below table s 1

resolve conformational changes resulting in an interparticle distance change of d 5 are possible to observe at a time resolution of 100 ms we would like to point out that this includes already real fluctuations by the molecule under investigation hsp 90 these fluctuations within one conformational state contain information of the molecule itself limits of plasmon rulers our realization of the plasmon ruler technique has not yet reached the maximum possible observation bandwidth there should not be fundamental limit for the total observation time except for the lifetime of the molecule under investigation on the other extreme the data acquisition speed is fundamentally limited for two different reasons conformational dynamics faster than the gold sphere diffusion time cannot be measured in our case this time resolution would be 0 1 s calculated for a distance change x of 1 nm and spheres of 60 nm diameter the other limit is the heating associated with the increase of illumination power necessary to yield an equivalent signal to noise ratio as in our measurements if we tolerate a temperature increase of 1 k we could reduce the time to about 7 s see below technical improvements like a more efficient light collection detectors with higher quantum yield or lower read out noise could reduce this time further both calculations indicate that with sufficiently fast detectors protein conformational dynamics can possibly be observed with s time resolution estimation of temperature increase our illumination i 1 1 104 w m 2 heats 9 the particles about t cabs i 4 r 7 10 4 k in this estimation we assume the particles to be surrounded by water with a thermal conductivity 0 591 w m k and no significant barrier for the heat transfer from the particles to water the light absorption cross section of our gold spheres is approximately cabs 1 5 10 14 m 2 for a temperature increase of tmax 1 k we could therefore increase the illumination intensity by about 1 7 10 4 resulting in a time resolution of about 7 s 12 additional time traces showing hsp 90 fluctuations qualitatively figure s 7 additional timetraces showing hsp 90 fluctuations timetraces of the dimers showing typical conformational transitions of hsp 90 complexes in the nucleotide free protein apo and in the presence of atp the traces were recorded for 6 12 and 24 hours with times resolutions between 10 hz to 50 hz 13 decay rates the table below shows the three decay rates for the open and closed state of hsp 90 obtained from a combination of all acquired traces under nucleotide free condition without atp we obtained 27700 dwell times for the nucleotide containing buffer with atp we observed 33000 transitions we used a double exponential decay function to extract the first two fast decay rates t 1 and t 2 from the cumulative dwell time distribution p 1 the slow decay rate t 3 was extracted by linear regression to the cumulative occurrence p t table s 3 decay rates of sub states within the open and closed configuration determined from the dwell time distribution of plasmon ruler experiments in the presence and absence of atp open closed t 1 s t 2 s t 3 s t 1 s t 2 s t

with a hidden markov model hmm based approach 10 the hmm yields the optimal kinetic model including the rates for all transitions the rates were compared for hmms trained with the plasmon and fret data respectively overall a good agreement of the rates is found for the transitions that occur most often in the data set 1 2 and 2 1 the different size of the confidence intervals error bars between plasmon and fret data reflects the different size of the two data sets 864000 time points for plasmon and 25200 for fret even though the plasom data was recorded with a slightly higher sampling rate compared to the fret data 10 hz vs 5 hz transition rates are mostly smaller for the plasmon data this reflects the fact that predominantly long dwells are missed with the fret approach thus overestimating the rate figure s 8 rates from hidden markov modelling the transition rates from a hidden markov analysis yields very similar rates between a fret experiment gray bars and plasmon rulers red bars 14 variation between different single molecules we compared the total times spend in the open closed configuration for different molecules to test if the ergodic principle and the assumption of molecular homogeneity is correct in figure s 9 we show the time in the molecule spends in the open configuration for different molecules both for buffers containing atp pink triangles and lacking atp blue circles the molecules in buffers containing atp are mostly locked in the open position 90 of the time on average however there is a large variation between different molecules showing values between 43 and 96 which means that either the molecules are not as homogeneous as thought or the observation time of 12 24 hours is not enough to ensure ergodicity figure s 9 time spend in the open configuration for different molecules the molecules shown by blue lines and blue circles are measured without atp in the buffer the molecules shown by pink lines and triangles in an atp containing buffer the former molecules spend 75 of their time in open states on average the latter 90 of the time all traces are measured for 6 24 hours the large deviations between molecules shows either non ergodic behavior or molecular inhomogeneity signal to noise for single molecule fret and plasmon rulers figure s 10 comparison of single molecule traces from fret and plasmon ruler measurements fret traces upper row are significantly shorter and noisier than plasmon ruler traces lower row both traces are shown with the same timescale the fret traces show the fret efficiency which is a measure of the intermolecular distance however there is more information in the donor acceptor fluorescence not shown here that is used to assign the open closed conformation the plasmon ruler trace in the bottom shows only 300 s out of 86400 s 24 hours the dots show the actual data points colored according the open blue and closed red conformation the thin gray lines connecting adjacent points is a guide to the eye 15 references 1 mickler m hessling m ratzke c buchner j hugel t the large conformational changes of hsp 90 are only weakly coupled to atp hydrolysis nat struct
