adenine a guanine g cytosine c and thymine t all prokaryotes have genomes consisting of double stranded dna where the a s and g s purines of one strand bind respectively to the t s and c s pyrim idines of the other as such the number of a s on one strand nearly equals the number of t s on the other and the same is true of one strand s g s and the other s c s globally this relationship is formal ized as chargaff s first parity rule its strandwise equivalent is char gaff s second parity rule therefore the gc content of any double stranded dna genome can be expressed as gc 100 at variation in prokaryotic gc content can be substantial between taxa but is generally small within microbial genomes this variation has been found to correlate with both phylogeny and environmental factors since novel single nucleotide polymorphisms snps within genomes are at least partially linked to the environment snp gc content can be considered a compound measure of an organism s envi ronmental influences lifestyle and phylogeny we present a mathematical model that describes how snp gc content in microbial genomes evolves over time as a function of the at gc and gc at mutation rates with gaussian white noise dis turbances the model suggests that in non recombining bacteria mu tations can first accumulate unnoticeably and then abruptly fluctuate 1 http arxiv org abs 1908 09144 v 1 out of control thus minuscule variations in mutation rates can sud denly become unsustainable ultimately driving a species to extinction if not counteracted early enough this model which is suited specif ically to symbiotic prokaryotes conforms to scenarios predicted by muller s ratchet and may suggest that this is not always a gradual degrading process it is also in agreement with some of the empirical evidence that motivated the formulation of the red queen hypothesis we apply our model to different lineages of renibacterium salmoni narum and find a substantial increase in snp gc content within the most disseminated lineage 1 a that increase could be due to a dra matic change in environment for this lineage 1 introduction gc content varies considerably between prokaryotic species but is remark ably stable genome wide despite the fact that bacterial genomes are pre dominantly functional and expressed in some sense 1 bacteria can have an average genomic gc content of as low as 13 5 candidatus zinderia in secticola or of as high as 75 anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans 2 while both large and small bacteria can be either gc rich or at rich there seems to be a tendency at least in some phylogentic groups for symbionts with smaller genomes to be more at rich while soil dwelling bacteria with large genomes tend to be more gc rich 4 5 the mechanisms responsible for gc richness in bacteria with large genomes are poorly understood far more can be deduced from at rich bacteria with small genomes see 5 for a general review of gc content in prokaryotes for instance it was conjectured 6 before being later demonstrated 7 that mutations are generally at biased due to frequent methylation of cy tosine that can subsequently change to thymine bacteria in a symbiotic relationship with their host often an insect undergo reductive evolution through the loss of genes rendered unnecessary by the within host envi ronment there is a clear evolutionary drive towards economizing energy expenditure 8 21 when host organisms have low effective population size ne or density genetic drift also influences the size and base composition of symbiont genomes 9 10 the outside environment can also affect genomic base composition in bacteria 12 phylogenetic relatedness on the other hand exerts strong pressure against changes in gc content this is due in large part to the significant role that protein coding genes play in bacteria and to the fact that mutations in the first two positions of a codon can change the amino acid defined by that codon 13 phylogenetic influence on base composition in prokaryotes seems to be most prominent at the genus level and below 18 there are several indicators that genome size reduction occurs before genomic gc content drops 9 loss of dna mismatch repair mmr genes 2 and proofreading enzymes can nevertheless lead to a relatively quick decrease in genomic gc content 14 an increase in genomic gc content on the other hand can result in increased fitness 15 and this is associated with stronger selection on base composition 17 18 19 abundance of nitrogen as in soil has been identified as a driver for increased genomic gc content 16 a recent study 2 found that single nucleotide polymorphisms snps in microbial core genomes from different taxa were surprisingly gc rich except in cases where the genomes themselves were already among the most gc rich the study presented a mathematical model describing snp gc content as a function of core genome gc content the model indicated that gc at mutations occurred at roughly double the rate of at gc mutations which suggests that most gc at mutations are lost prior to fixation 2 in another recent study 3 it was shown that while gc at mutation rates are remarkably consistent across bacterial taxa at gc mutation rates vary considerably since the environment exerts selective pressure on bacterial base composition 12 13 it should at least partly be reflected in core genome snps together with evolutionary history lifestyle and taxon stochastic events strongly impact the influence of the environment on genomic base composition in bacteria inspired by motoo kimura s seminal paper 11 we modify a previously described model 2 to investigate snp gc content evolution with respect to time furthermore we extend the model with the assumption of gaussian white noise perturbations in the mutation rates we assume that snp gc content is subject to chargaff s parity rules in practice this means that core genome snp gc content depends on the bases that are selected including through hitchhiking 37 and not on random mutations that are purged before fixation we employ ito calculus to solve the stochastic differential equation sde that accounts for the random perturbations in the at gc and gc at mutation rate parameters we then discuss implications of the model and present out comes that show striking concordance with muller s ratchet 22 and with evolutionary mechanisms described by the red queen hypothesis 23 24 finally we apply the model to a genomic data set consisting of snp gc content differences in lineages of the fish pathogen renibacterium salmoni narum taken from 20 2 mathematical model 2 1 motivation the mathematical model presented here is an extension of the model pre sented in 2 the original model which describes the change in core genome 3 snp gc content with respect to core genome gc content is dfgc x dx fgc x 1 fgc x 1 x represents core genome gc content while fgc x represents snp gc content these terms are subject to the constraints 0 x 1 and 0 fgc x 1 in 2 the parameters and were estimated by fitting the model to empirical data using either non linear least square regression 2 or bayesian inference 3 in the present study we are concerned with the change in snp gc content with respect to time in a stochastic setting that is we are now interested in the relation ft t ft ft t 1 ft t 2 where ft represents snp gc content at time t the change in ft with respect to trajectory during time t is a parameter times ft times t plus a parameter times 1 ft snp at content at time t times t in other words the difference in snp gc content with respect to time is assumed to be equal to parameter multiples of snp gc content and snp at content in classical calculus notation we write dft dt ft 1 ft 3 here ft is a stochastic process and we let a wt and b wt where a b r and wt is a gaussian white noise process equation 3 is subject to the probability space ft p as well as the measure space r g dt is the space of all trajectories ft is its filtration with respect to each time t r i e 0 of which g is the cor responding borel algebra and dt lebesgue measure and p is a probability measure on we now have dft dt a wt ft b wt 1 ft aft ft wt b 1 ft wt 1 ft aft b 1 ft wt hence dft dt aft b 1 ft wt 4 it is important to note that in the present form this derivative does not exist in the classical sense or in the radon nikodym sense for ft however if we assume that ft is a continuous semimartingale allowing for countable 4 and bounded jumps the doob meyer decomposition theorem pp 129 133 of 25 guarantees that ft f 0 a t xt where a t is a function of bounded variation and xt is a local martingale moreover this decomposition is unique and both a t and xt are adapted to ft if we assume that xt is a brownian motion then by chapter 3 of 26 4 can be written as dft aft b 1 ft dt dbt 5 though the term aft b 1 ft dt resembles 1 we must handle the brownian motion term dbt in a non classical way we allow for scaled volatility c as it is not unreasonable to expect variance differences across organisms and or environments in addition to time t it can be shown that a scaled brownian motion is also a brownian motion let ut be a brownian motion see for instance ch 2 of 26 then e ut 1 2 t r ue u 2 2 t du letting u cz and du dz c it follows that 1 2 t r ue u 2 2 t du 1 2 t c 2 r ze c 2 z 2 2 t cdz 1 2 t c 2 r cze c 2 z 2 2 t dz e cz t c 2 we do not presume that ft can see into the future thus the martingale condition e fs ft ft with s t holds when e is the expectation operator with respect to probability measure p i e e x xdp as such we assume that ft is adapted to the fil tration ft for each t which motivates the use of the ito integral instead of the fisk stratonovich integral 25 it is therefore enough to assume that ft is a ca dla g process i e lims t fs ft left continuous with right limits see ch 2 of 25 implying that ft has a countable number of bounded jumps we can then use the ito formula see ch 4 of 26 to solve 5 furthermore since we assume that 0 ft 1 and that a b are finite constants it is guaranteed that 5 has a strong and unique solution see ch 5 of 26 first we must identify an integrating factor that removes ft from the right hand side let dft aft b 1 ft dt db t aft bft b dt db t a b ft b dt db t 5 where b t is a c scaled brownian motion letting g t x e a b t x we get the integrating factor g t ft yt e a b t ft applying ito s formula p 44 of 26 we see that dyt g t t ft dt g t t ft dft 1 2 2 g x 2 t ft dft 2 6 because 2 g x 2 t x 0 the last term of 6 is equal to zero as a result dyt g t t ft dt g x t ft dft a b e a b t ft dt e a b t dft a b e a b t ft dt e a b t a b ft b dt db t be a b t dt e a b t db t thus we have the differential dyt be a b t dt e a b t db t 7 and so dyt d e a b t ft be a b t dt e a b t db t we can then find the formula for ft by setting s 0 t and letting d e a b t ft be a b t dt e a b t db t which gives e a b t ft f 0 t 0 be a b s ds t 0 e a b s db s and ft f 0 e a b t t 0 be a b t s ds t 0 e a b t s db s 8 assuming that ft is a semimartingale we have from the doob meyer decomposition that t 0 be a b t s ds is of bounded variation and that t 0 e a b t s db s is a local martingale which is in fact a martingale see pp 129 133 of 25 while the latter martingale term must be solved numerically the 6 antiderivative of the bounded variation term can be solved using the chain rule t 0 be a b t s ds c 0 b a b e a b t 1 we thus obtain the explicit equation for ft ft f 0 e a b t b a b e a b t 1 t 0 e a b t s db s that can be written as ft b a b f 0 b a b e a b t t 0 e a b t s db s 9 which is subject to the constraints t 0 and 0 ft 1 the integration constant c 0 is just assumed included in f 0 it should be noted that for f 0 0 e ft b a b e a b t 1 10 since the martingale term vanishes see p 30 of 26 we get the solution to 1 when t x 2 furthermore we do not need to bother with the martingale term when estimating parameters a and b the variance is given by var ft e ft e ft 2 which we can solve by setting a f 0 e a b t b a b e a b t 1 and b t 0 e a b t s db s this gives var ft e ft e ft 2 e a b 2 2 a b a a 2 e a 2 2 ab b 2 2 a 2 2 ab a 2 e b 2 e t 0 e a b t s db s 2 the ito isometry see p 26 of 26 gives e t 0 e a b t s db s 2 e t 0 e a b t s 2 ds t 0 e 2 a b t s ds 7 we can solve t 0 e 2 a b t s ds explicitly by calculating its antiderivative t 0 e 2 a b t s ds d 0 1 2 a b e 2 a b t 1 hence we recover the expectation for ft e ft f 0 e a b t b a b e a b t 1 11 and the corresponding variance integration constant d 0 set to zero var ft 1 2 a b e 2 a b t 1 12 2 2 the parameters a and b we note that 0 e ft f 0 e a b t b a b e a b t 1 1 13 for t 0 we see from condition 13 that 0 f 0 1 for a b 0 e a b t approaches inifinity so this condition is not reasonable we are therefore left with the condition a b 0 since 0 f 0 1 we get 0 f 0 e a b t b a b e a b t 1 1 letting t we see that 0 b b a 1 which implies that b 0 and that a 0 for a b the bounded variation term a t in eq 9 collapses into a linear equation a t b a b e a b t 1 b a b 1 a b t a b 2 t 2 2 a b ntn n 1 b 1 a b t a b 1 t 2 2 a b n 1 tn n 1 a b b t a b 1 t 2 2 a b n 1 tn n bt 14 we will henceforth assume that f 0 0 and a b 0 8 2 3 the martingale term we use gaussian white noise to model perturbations in the at gc a and gc at b mutation rates we also allow for scaling of c 0 as men tioned above the scale can be determined by factors such as species strain environment host and presence of mmr genes the martingale term t 0 e a b t s db s 15 depends on the parameters a and b as well as on the duration of the time period since we assume that a b 0 the martingale term approaches 0 as t and brownian motion b t for a b for a b 0 it can be seen that 15 increases as s t we can reach the same conclusion by examining the variance of ft described in 12 above the brownian motion is assumed to have mean 0 and variance e b 2 t t thus the variance of browninan motion is in general expected to increase with time t since there is no simple way to calculate the integral in 15 analytically we do so numerically t 0 e a b t s db s sn s 0 e a b t si w si 1 w si si 16 where w s is c scaled white noise si si 1 si and s 0 0 si ti sn t 2 4 the girsanov transform equation 7 can be written as dft a b ft b dt db t since we know from 9 that ft b a b f 0 b a b e a b t t 0 e a b t s db s if we let zt t 0 e a b t s db s then zt is an ito process see 26 after some rearrangements we can set kt a b f 0 b a b e a b t zt and since zt is a martingale we know from the doob meyer decompo sition that kt is also a martingale we can thus write dft kt dt db t 9 the girsanov theorem allows us to compute the radon nikodym derivative see ch 3 p 146 of 25 of a measure q with respect to the probability measure p as follows dq dp exp t 0 ks db s 1 2 t 0 k 2 s ds this means that ft is a brownian motion under the measure q since we assume that a b 0 which implies that kazamaki s and hence novikov s condition apply t see chs 4 and 8 of 26 2 5 further generalizations the model describing snp gc content can be made more general if we as sume that the parameters a and b are functions it is important to note that if a and b are functions with respect to time obtaining an analytical solution may be impossible while up to this point we have assumed that variation in the model is described by a white noise process a more complicated noise term xt could also be used for instance if we let dft dt a xt ft b xt 1 ft we have dft dt aft xt ft b xt b xt ft this reduces to dft dt a b ft b xt where xt t t w t thus dft dt aft b 1 ft t t w t and after rearranging dft a b ft t b dt t dbt 17 we could for instance letxt be a mean reverting ornstein uhlenbeck process i e dxt dt gc 0 ft w t 10 a 6 b 2 c 1 time t 0 t 0 5 0 1 0 9 a 5 b 1 c 0 1 time t 0 t 0 5 0 1 0 9 a 3 b 0 01 c 0 01 time t 0 t 0 5 0 1 0 9 a 4 b 4 c 0 02 time t 0 t 0 5 0 1 0 9 a 1 b

vertical axis describes snp gc content while the horizontal axis describes time t from t 0 0 to t 1 hence we let t gc 0 ft and t 1 plugging these into 17 we see dft a b ft gc 0 b dt db t 18 we can now use the integrating factor g t ft yt e a b t ft to solve 18 in a similar fashion to 8 3 results and discussion equation 9 describes a model for core genome snp gc content in prokary otes it obeys chargaff s parity laws 27 as discussed in section 1 snps are subject to natural selection which is in turn mediated by the environ ment of the organism s at hand while a drop in snp gc content could indicate relaxed selective pressures with ensuing mutations from genetic drift and at mutational bias 7 increased negative or purifying selection may favor gc biased snps 1 17 18 19 selective pressure for improved fitness could also lead to increased gc content 15 carbon starvation 41 and or nitrogen abundance 16 have also been found to have an effect on genomic base composition 11 all in all microbial organisms in the same environments often acquire the same nucleotide biases if enough time is allowed to pass 12 13 such environmental signatures become particularly evident in snps since as dis cussed above and in section 1 these polymorphisms arise as a consequence of natural selection regulated by the environment by fitting 9 to empiri cal data with either non linear regression models or bayesian inference we can estimate the relative proportions of mutation from at gc a and gc at b over time the model described by 1 estimates analogous parameters for at gc and gc at but with respect to core genome gc content rather than time 3 1 the accumulating effects of stochastic processes figure 1 shows different paths of snp gc content with respect to time increase decrease and stasis for various brownian scaling coefficients c all stochastic fluctuations observed in the curves in figure 1 are a con sequence of the brownian motion term 15 these snp gc content curves all become more unstable as time passes to varying degrees depending on c the mathematical mechanisms behind these stochastic fluctuations are outlined in section 2 3 equation 15 indicates that both the mutation pa rameters a and b are responsible for how the stochastic fluctuations progress with respect to time see also section 2 2 some of the paths in figure 1 initially exhibit barely visible stochastic fluctuations but these grow in magnitude as the snp gc content mutation rates start to vary out of control especially for low values of c the progression of the stochastic fluctuations in the snp gc content curves for low c is not at all expected a priori below we demonstrate that the nature of the abruptly exploding mutation rates is supported both in theory 22 23 24 and in practice in the following examples we focus on mechanisms resulting in genome reduction 8 9 and subsequent at bias in the base composition of many symbionts we end this section with a case study utilizing real genetic data on snp gc content in different lineages of the fish pathogen r salmoninarum 3 2 evolution of microbial obligate symbionts free living bacteria that develop a sustained symbiotic relationship with a host 34 will often over time undergo genome reduction 8 this process of genome reduction is preceded by a phase of pseudogenization in which the symbiont s genome retains its usual size 29 but the genes are not un der selective constraints imposed by the host and thus become abundant accumulated mutations eventually render many genes defective 9 28 the process of pseudogenization may drag on for a long time 30 but eventu ally non expressed genetic regions will be excised due to energy economiza 12 tion 21 lack of recombination and or the absence of streamlining due to low population density and reduced selective pressure from the environment 10 22 the first genes lost are typically those least conserved within a species 35 it is only after a continuous symbiotic relationship and the pseudogenization phase that a drop in genomic gc content seems to oc cur most likely because of the loss of mmr genes that counter the at mutational bias 8 after the decrease in genomic gc content there is usually no return to a free living lifestyle for the bacterium 30 non recombining symbionts ultimately disintegrate as described by the concept of muller s ratchet 22 according to some recent findings the host which eventually becomes de pendent on the symbiont can establish similar relationships with other bac teria 28 33 30 9 34 intracellular pathogens on the other hand do not appear to engage in symbiotic relationships with a host most likely due to the increased constraints of a pathogen host relationship 36 as such though these pathogens may undergo genome reduction they do not seem to experience the same dramatic gene loss observed in some symbionts which are reduced to mere organelles in their hosts 28 it is not uncommon however for the genomic base composition of intracellular pathogens to be at biased 36 there do appear to be some similarities between the evolutionary mecha nisms of symbionts and those of free living bacteria that undergo changes in environment even if not through attachment to a host there are only a few documented examples of free living bacteria that experience genome reduc tion with subsequent genomic at bias after a change in environment niche one of these is the cyanobacterium prochlorococcus spp 31 whose high light ecotypes living close to the water surface are more at rich and have smaller genomes than the low light ecotypes living at greater depths 32 indeed genomic gc content and genome size increase respectively from 30 8 and 1 66 megabase pairs mbp in the high light strains to 50 0 and 2 68 mbp in the low light strains 32 3 3 modeling at bias in microbial genomes as mentioned above microbial genomes appear to become more at rich after the loss of mmr genes regardless of niche and or environment this is most likely due to at mutational bias 7 and it may be mediated by genetic drift in light of relaxed selective pressures 8 the model in 15 was formulated in a recent study 2 that assumed that the change in snp gc content with respect to core genome gc content was a constant multiple of snp gc content and another constant multiplied by snp at content in the present study we investigated how snp gc content evolves over time allowing for stochastic fluctuations we modeled these fluctuations using a gaussian white noise process w t which is subject to 13 a scaled c 0 in the at gc and gc at mutation rates we introduced the scaling to account for differences between species environment niche and selective pressures or lack thereof from figure 1 it can be seen that the mutation rates remain fairly stable at least in the increasing and decreasing curves before abruptly fluctuating out of control once we decrease c the random fluctuations start sooner and escalate a bit more since the mutation rates fluctuate so drastically as time t t it is natural to expect that the outcome predicted by muller s ratchet will be achieved 22 i e that the bacterial population will go extinct how ever 9 suggests that although the random fluctuations start relatively late the species fate may be sealed far earlier before any stochastic fluctuation can be observed a loss of mmr genes could imply that the scaling parameter c adds more weight to the martingale term 2 1 which triggers the amplification of the stochastic fluctuations however the similarity of the mutation rate parameters a and b can also influence the magnitude of the stochastic fluc tuations indeed from 15 it can be seen that low mutation rates magnify the effect of the martingale term as a b 0 since e a b 1 3 4 connections with theories from evolutionary biology leigh van valen wanted a model to confirm that extinction rates correlate with age in the fossil record however after testing this hypothesis he found no such correlation 23 thus he formulated the red queen hypothesis taking its name from lewis carroll s 1871 book through the looking glass and what alice found there in that book the red queen utters to alice about the nature of looking glass land now here you see it takes all the running you can do to keep in the same place later on the red queen hypothesis was expanded to account for molec ular data as well 24 the model presented in 9 demonstrates related mechanisms for prokaryotes and sheds light on the case of microbial sym bionts that have undergone genome reduction with a subsequent drop in gc content if mutations are not kept in check extinction will ensue in other words the martingale term 15 must be kept as low as possible in order to avoid the random fluctuations that lead to extinction since the choice of c is shaped by factors such as species environment host and mutation rates extinction rates will differ between populations as predicted by the red queen hypothesis see also figure 1 furthermore non recombining clonal organisms will sooner or later accumulate deleterious mutations that decrease the organisms fitness to the point of driving their species to ex tinction in the previous section we discussed how microbial symbionts undergo genome reduction together with a drop in gc content most likely as a con sequence of lost mmr genes the genomes of these symbionts eventually 14 year 1972 2009 gc gc 0 0 565 gc 0 75 figure 2 r salmoninarum lineage 1 a snp gc content vertical axis plot ted against year horizontal axis snp gc content of lineages 1 b and 2 is similar to r salmoninarum genomic gc content red line disintegrate due to accumulated hitchhiking effects 37 and genetic drift as posited by muller s ratchet 22 there are experimental findings to support these hypotheses 44 our model in 9 provides insight to this by delineat ing the stochastic fluctuation in mutation rates that will ultimately spiral out of control depending on the mutation parameters a and b and on the scaling parameter c 3 5 mutation rates in r salmoninarum the fish pathogen r salmoninarum is the causative agent of bacterial kid ney disease bkd which predominantly afflicts salmonoids r salmoni narum belongs to the gc rich gram positive actinobacteria family it is an intracellular pathogen with a genome size of approximately 3 15 mbp and a genomic gc content of 56 5 its genome is remarkably well conserved and thus appears not to recombine 20 in a previous publication we examined the snp gc content over time of r salmoninarum lineage 1 consisting of sublineages 1 a isolated from north america and europe and 1 b isolated from north america and of lineage 2 isolated from the uk and norway 20 while sublineage 1 b 3 isolates and lineage 2 7 isolates are more endemic to particular environments sublineage 1 a 52 isolates is widely dispersed across north america and norway we found that snp gc content in sublineage 1 b and in lineage 2 was equal to 56 5 i e the genomic gc content the snp gc 15 content of sublineage 1 a however was approximately 75 see figure 2 therefore we here set c 1 and f 0 0 565 to correspond to the genomic gc content we estimate a and b using bayesian inference selecting non informative uniform distributions as priors for both parameters the median posterior estimates are a 22 668 and b 67 421 which suggests that the martingale term 15 holds minimal influence furthermore the gc at mutation rate is substantially higher than the at gc mutation rate there is a ratio of almost 3 1 between them 67 421 22 668 2 98 which is highly unusual 3 though the increased snp gc content is puzzling it may indicate that sublineage 1 a is subject to stronger selective pressure than sublineage 1 b and lineage 2 17 19 since recombination is not known to take place in r salmoninarum recent publications argue that nitrogen abundance and car bon starving which can occur at great ocean depths may push for increased gc content 16 41 but further research is needed before any conclusion can be drawn 4 conclusions we have presented a mathematical model that describes change in snp gc content over time as a function of mutation parameters a and b the model contains a stochastic term that describes how minuscule random changes in mutation rates early on can lead to abrupt disastrous fluctuations later we treated examples of this phenomenon in host associated and symbiotic bacteria the model with its incorporated stochastic term and corresponding scal ing parameter c shows remarkable congruence with at least some parts of the red queen hypothesis in the model c must not be too large to avoid genomic disintegration varying c among species implies that the lifespan of a species need not correlate with the time to its extinction furthermore the model demonstrates how muller s ratchet operates and suggests that extinction may occur rapidly depending on c as opposed to arising slowly when we applied the model to different lineages of r salmoninarum we found that one sublineage 1 a exhibited a dramatic increase of approxi mately 20 in snp gc content while no differences were detected in sub lineage 1 b or lineage 2 dramatic drops in genomic gc content have been documented in both host associated and free living bacteria increases in ge nomic gc content are less common the substantial rise in snp gc content observed in sublineage 1 a may thus be the start of a process leading to in creased genomic gc content since recombination is absent or at least very rare in r salmoninarum the increase in snp gc content may also indi cate that the genome is subject to increased selective pressure which drives the genomic gc content upwards alternatively sublineage 1 a could have 16 moved to a different environmental niche than sublineage 1 b and lineage 2 one in which carbon is scarce 41 our use of stochastic differential equations which allow for deterministic modeling of random processes revealed how bacterial mutation rates may be influenced by stochastic fluctuations although simple the model described here provides novel insight into evolutionary processes with mathematical rigour 5 materials and methods the genomes utilized in our study were taken from a previous publication 20 they are all available from the european bioinformatics institute accession number prjeb 4487 the genomic data files were assembled using maq 0 7 1 38 against the reference r salmoninarum atcc 33209 ncbi accession number nc 010168 1 as described in 20 in the present study 6
