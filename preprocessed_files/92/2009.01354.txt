2 centro de matem tica da universidade do porto porto portugal correspondence to gabriela gomes strath ac uk developing feasible strategies and setting realistic targets for disease prevention and control depends on representative models whether conceptual experimental logistical or mathematical mathematical modelling was established in infectious diseases over a century ago with the seminal works of ross 1 and others propelled by the discovery of aetiological agents for infectious diseases and koch s postulates models have focused on the complexities of pathogen transmission and evolution to understand and predict disease trends in greater depth 2 this has led to their adoption by policy makers however as model informed policies are being implemented the inaccuracies of some predictions are increasingly apparent most notably their tendency to overestimate the impact of control interventions 3 6 here we discuss how these discrepancies could be explained by methodological limitations in capturing the effects of heterogeneity in real world systems we suggest that improvements could derive from theory developed in demography to study variation in life expectancy and ageing 7 using simulations we illustrate the problem and its impact and formulate a pragmatic way forward heterogeneity affects accuracy of predictive models for disease control we use the examples of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids and coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 to illustrate the effects that individual variation can have on the performance of mathematical models for the dynamics of endemic and epidemic diseases endemic infectious diseases since the detection of aids in the early 1980 s it has been evident that heterogeneity in individual sexual behaviours needed to be considered in mathematical models for the transmission of the causative agent the human immunodeficiency virus hiv 8 much research has been devoted to measuring contact networks in diverse settings and by different methods to attempt to reproduce transmission dynamics accurately 9 11 meanwhile other equally important sources of inter individual variation were overlooked for example unmodelled heterogeneity in infectiousness and susceptibility led to over attribution of hiv infectivity to the acute phase 12 and consequently to concerns that interventions relying on treatment as prevention might be compromised the problem of unaccounted heterogeneity in predictive models can be illustrated with the simplest mathematical description of infectious disease transmission in a host population figure 1 shows the prevalence of infection over time under three alternative scenarios all individuals are at equal risk of acquiring infection black trajectories notice unrealistic time scale individual risk is affected by a factor that modifies either their susceptibility to infection blue or exposure through connectivity with other individuals green risk modifying factors are drawn from a distribution with mean one blue and green density plots on the left while the 2 homogeneous scenario is sketched by assigning a factor one to all individuals black frequency plot as the virus spreads in the human population individuals at higher risk are predominantly infected as indicated at endemic equilibrium figure 1 a b c density plots on the right coloured red and after 100 years of control figure 1 d e f the control strategy applied to endemic equilibrium in the figure is the 90 90 90 treatment as prevention target advocated by the joint united nations programme on hiv aids 4 whereby 90 of infected individuals should be detected with 90 of these receiving antiretroviral therapy and 90 of these should achieve viral suppression becoming effectively non infectious figure 1

mark the mean risk values 1 in all cases at endemic equilibrium individuals with higher risk are predominantly infected risk panels on the right where red vertical lines mark mean baseline risk among individuals who eventually became infected resulting in reduced mean risk among those who remain uninfected black vertical lines to compensate for this selection effect heterogeneous models require a

reduces intervention impact d e f models homogeneous a d and heterogeneous susceptibility b e and heterogeneous connectivity c f and in heterogeneous models is a probability density function with mean 1 and variance 10 and denotes the th moment of the distribution gamma distributions were used for concreteness 3 figure 1 shows that heterogeneous models that account for wide biological and social variation require higher basic reproduction numbers to reach a given endemic level and predict less impact for control efforts when compared with the homogeneous counterpart model this holds true regardless of whether heterogeneity affects susceptibility or connectivity at endemic equilibrium individuals at higher risk are predominantly infected red distributions have mean greater than one as marked by the red vertical lines and hence those who remain uninfected are individuals with lower risk blue and green distributions have mean lower than one as marked by the black vertical lines thus the mean risk in the uninfected but susceptible subpopulation decreases and the epidemic decelerates thin blue and green curves higher values of are consequently required if the heterogeneous models are to attain the same endemic level as the homogeneous formulation heavy blue and green curves finally interventions are less impactful under heterogeneity because is implicitly higher indeed these biases could help explain trends in hiv incidence data which lag substantially behind targets informed by model predictions even in settings that have reached the 90 90 90 implementation targets 3 4 epidemic infectious diseases a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov 2 isolated at the end of 2019 from a patient in china has spread worldwide causing the covid 19 pandemic despite intensive measures to contain the outbreak at the source countrywide epidemics have been extensively analysed and modelled throughout the world initial studies projected attack rates of around 90 if transmission had been left unmitigated 13 while subsequent reports noted that individual variation in susceptibility or exposure to infection might reduce these estimates substantially 14 15 and skew epidemic curves compare the blue heterogeneous susceptibility and green heterogeneous connectivity curves with the black homogeneous figure 2 incidence trajectories under homogeneous and heterogeneous models risk distributions are simulated in three scenarios homogeneous black distributed susceptibility to infection with variance 10 blue distributed connectivity with variance 10 green left panels represent distributions of potential individual risk prior to the outbreak with vertical lines marking mean risk values 1 in all cases as the epidemic progresses individuals with higher

heterogeneous susceptibility blue and heterogeneous connectivity green and in heterogeneous models is a probability density function with mean 1 and variance 10 and denotes the th moment of the distribution gamma distributions were used for concreteness as models inform policies we cannot but stress the importance of representing individual variation pragmatically while much is being discovered about sars cov 2 and its interaction with human hosts epidemic curves are widely available from locations where the virus has been circulating models can be constructed with inbuilt risk distributions whose shape can be inferred by assessing their ability to mould simulated trajectories to observed epidemics while accounting for realistic social distancing interventions 6 variation in infectiousness was critical to attribute the scarce and explosive outbreaks to superspreaders when the first sars emerged in 200216 but what we are discussing here is different infectiousness does not respond to selection as susceptibility or connectivity do i e models with and without variation in infectiousness perform equivalently when implemented deterministically and only differ through stochastic processes the need to account for heterogeneity in risk to acquire infections is not restricted to aids and covid 19 but is generally applicable across infectious disease epidemiology models moreover similar issues arise in methods intended to evaluate the efficacy interventions from experimental studies as illustrated for vaccines in the sequel heterogeneity and vaccine efficacy over time and across settings individual variation in susceptibility to infection induces biases in cohort studies and clinical trials vaccine efficacy trials offer a useful illustration of the problem and give insight into the potential solution in a vaccine trial two groups of individuals are randomised to receive a vaccine or placebo and disease occurrences are recorded in each group as disease affects predominantly higher risk individuals the mean risk among those who remain unaffected decreases and disease incidence declines in the vaccine group the same trend will occur at a slower pace presuming that the vaccine protects to some degree as a result the two randomised groups become different over time with more highly susceptible individuals remaining in the vaccine group the vaccine efficacy described as a ratio of cases in vaccinated compared to control group therefore appears to wane figure 3 17 18 this effect will be stronger in settings where transmission intensity is higher inducing a trend of seemingly declining efficacy with disease burden 19 the concept is illustrated in figure 3 by simulating a vaccine trial with heterogeneous and homogeneous models analogous to those utilised in figures 1 and 2 selection on individual variation in disease susceptibility thus offers an explanation for vaccine efficacy trends that is entirely based on population level heterogeneity in contrast with waning vaccine induced immunity an individual level effect 20 as both processes may occur concurrently in a trial it is important to disentangle their roles as they lead to different interpretations of the same incidence trend for example vaccine efficacy might wane in all individuals or it might be constant for each individual but decline at the population level due to selection on individual variation to capture this in a timely manner requires multicentre trial designs with sites carefully selected over a gradient of transmission intensities e g optimally 5 spaced along the incidence axis in figure c f and analyses performed by fitting curves generated by models that incorporate individual heterogeneity an alternative and more tightly controlled approach would be to use experimental designs in human infection challenge studies where these are available 21 to generate dose response curves and apply similar models these approaches have recently been successfully tested in animal systems 22 figure 3 vaccine efficacy trajectories under homogeneous and heterogeneous models a b c heterogeneous susceptibility or connectivity gamma distributed with mean 1 and variance 10 d e f homogeneous model models homogeneous and heterogeneous and vaccine efficacy is calculated as 1 100 where and represent the incidences in vaccinated and control group respectively homogeneous heterogeneous individual heterogeneities and their inferences using risk inequality metrics heterogeneities in predispositions to infection depend on the mode of transmission but play a role in all high burden infectious diseases in respiratory infections heterogeneity may arise from a variation in exposure of the susceptible host to the

nutritional status pre existing respiratory illness such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and the presence of other concomitant diseases such as diabetes and hiv enteric diseases have different heterogeneities determined by the source and dose of contaminated sources vector borne parasites viruses and bacteria may be transmitted by mosquitoes ticks snails and other intermediate hosts where the risk of onward transmission is affected by heterogeneities in exposure and susceptibility across a complex range of host demographic environmental and social factors the mechanisms underpinning single factors for infection and their interactions determine individual propensities to acquire disease these are potentially so numerous that to attain a full mechanistic description may be unfeasible even in the unlikely scenario that a list of all putative factors may be available the measurement of effect sizes would be subject to selection within cohorts resulting in underestimated variances 23 to contribute constructively to the development of health policies model building involves compromises between leaving factors out reductionism or adopting a broader but coarse description holism holistic descriptions of heterogeneity are currently underutilised in infectious diseases recently measures of statistical dispersion commonly used in economics have been adapted to describe risk inequality in cancer 24 tuberculosis 25 and malaria 26 offering a holistic approach to improve the predictive capacity of disease models essentially this involves stratifying the population into groups of individuals with similar risk which may be as granular as individual level for frequent diseases such as malaria or influenza for infectious diseases which cluster by proximity such as tuberculosis stratification can use geographical units familial relatedness pertains when there is a clear genetic contribution to risk such as cancer by recording disease events in each group specific incidence rates can be calculated and ranked unknown distributions of individual risk are then embedded in dynamic models and estimated by fitting the models to the stratified data because they incorporate explicit distributions of individual risk these models automatically adjust average risks in susceptible pools to changes in transmission intensity occurring naturally or in response to interventions not subject to the selection biases described above this model approach inherently enables more accurate impact predictions for use in policy development conclusion there is compelling evidence that epidemiologists could use indicators that account for the whole variation in disease risk heterogeneity is unlimited in real world systems and cannot be completely reconstructed mechanistically inspired by established practices in demography and economics and supported by successful applications in both infectious and non communicable diseases the use and further development of these approaches offers a powerful route to build disease models that enable more accurate estimates of intervention efficacy and more accurate predictions of the impact of
