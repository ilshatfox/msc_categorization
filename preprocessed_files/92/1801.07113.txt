a mathematical model for tumor cell population dynamics based on target theory and tumor lifespan amin oroji 1 shantia yarahmadian 2 sarkhosh seddighi 3 and mohd omar 4 abstract radiation therapy xrt is one of the most common cancer treatment methods in this paper a new mathematical model is proposed for the population dynamics of heterogeneous tumor cells following external beam radiation treatment according to the target theory the tumor population is divided into m different subpopulations based on the diverse effects of ionizing radiation on human cells a hybrid model con sists of a system of differential equations with random variable coefficients representing the transition rates between subpopulations is proposed this model is utilized to sim ulate the dynamics of cell subpopulations within a tumor the model also describes the cell damage heterogeneity and the repair mechanism between two consecutive dose fractions as such a new definition of tumor lifespan based on population size is intro duced finally the stability of the system is studied by using the gershgorin theorem it is proven that the probability of target inactivity post radiation plays the most important role in the stability of the system 1 introduction it has been experimentally verified that the ionization process initiated by radiating particles leads to lesions in the cells 1 the negative effect on dna structure makes lesions the most harmful consequence of radiotherapy 2 3 substantial progress has been made both in the classification and evaluation of xrt treatment planning through probabilistic modeling the most well known models are tumor control probability tcp 4 5 6 and normal tissue complication probability ntcp 7 8 there have been numerous advances in stochastic modeling of tumor response to radiation treatment including the linear quadratic model 4 9 cell population dynamics models 10 11 12 mixed effects behavioral models 13 and cell cycle models 14 however many of these models are constructed to evaluate certain important features of xrt but they do not incorporate biological tumor damage heterogeneity which is the focus of our study we refer the reader to michelson and leith 15 for further information on different 1 ar x iv 1 80 1 07 11 3 v 1 q bi o q m 1 5 ja n 20 18 types of heterogeneity the key concept in understanding xrt biology is the target theory 16 a target is a radio sensitive site within a cell each cell contains a certain number of targets which may be deactivated after being hit by radiation particles moreover between two consecutive dose fractions each target may become active again following immune system reaction 17 despite the development of several complex interpretations of the target theory the essential principle entails radiation induced apoptosis of the organism on account of target s inac tivation within the organism although targets are considered functioning biological units 18 the number of targets and their locations in an organism are not always clear with re gard to cell sensitivity the majority of models usually assume that cell sensitivity is constant during radiation 19 20 21 the same assumption is also made for cell populations in that the viability of a surviving cell is similar to an irradiated cell i e all cells are assumed to have the same survival probabilities however theses assumptions may not be completely accurate as there is strong evidence that damaged cells are unable to resist radiation 19 20 the clinical significance of the intra tumor heterogeneity of cell phenotypes and cell damage is discussed in 22 and 23 as such providing a definition of a suitable treatment duration is rather a clinical challenge especially when considering therapeutic response variability in this regard keinj et al developed a discrete time markov chain multinomial model for tumor response 19 which employs the target theory this model inspects the number of surviving cells in the tumor but does not consider the tumor lifespan to be able to measure the tumor s response to treatment in this study we model tumor population dynamics via a system of ordinary differential equations thereafter we evaluate the transition rates using a markov chain the model is then applied to the special case of m 3 which is related to the effect of radiation on cells by dividing them into three subpopulations cells with no effect x 0 cells with single strand break x 1 and cells with double strand breaks x 2 in addition we analyze the system s stability in this case as well as the system bifurcation with two parameters the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the general theory and prelim inary findings in section 3 the tumor growth model is discussed terms of a system of ordinary differential equations with markov chain coefficients the model calibration is pre sented in section 4 thereafter a new definition for tumor lifespan is proposed in section 5 three targets in each cell and the model parameters are employed to analytically inves tigate the obtained ode system stability in section 6 finally section 7 concludes the study 2 modeling assumptions and framework we have considred the following assumptions in our modeling framework 2 1 cells have the same phenotype but they act independently 2 in the radiotherapy process the magnitude of each dose fraction u 0 is constant during treatment i e u 0 2 gy the time lag between two consecutive dose fractions is 24 hours 3 each cell consists of m targets which may be deactivated with probability q after each dose fraction p i j represents the treatment probability matrix in the transition from i to j inactive targets i e deactivating j targets when i targets has been disabled before 19 p i j is written as p i j m i j i qj i 1 q m j 0 i j j i 2 1 4 each target may be revived with probability r as described previously 19 r i j represents the repair probability matrix in the transition from i to j as given by r i j i j ri j 1 r j 0 j i m i j 2 2 where r m m 1 and r m j 0 for m 6 j 5 xi indicates the cell subpopulation with i deactivated target s where i 0 m 1 for i 6 j each cell can move from xi to xj with the constant time independent transition rate of i j 6 a cell will undergo radiation induced apoptosis if all targets are deactivated the cell death rate in subpopulation xi is considered as constant di 7 cells can reproduce if all targets become active for simplicity we assume that just before the repair mechanism acts cells in subpopulation x 0 can give birth to new cells proportional to subpopulation x 0 with a constant rate of as such each cell in subpopulation x 0 can divide into exactly two daughter cells with probability or it can remain unchanged with probability 1 between two consecutive dose fractions 3 model derivation as indicated in fig 1 tumor dynamics is generally described as the effect of radiotherapy on the different tumor cell subpopulations the conservation law for subpopulation xi s i 0 m 1 is written as follows for i 0 dx 0 t dt x 0 t birth due to mitosis m 1 j 1 j 0 xj t transition to x 0 transition from x 0 m 1 k 1 0 k x 0 t death d 0 x 0 t 3 1 3 figure 1 schematic illustration of tumor cell population model and for i 6 0 dxi t dt m 1 j 0 j 6 i j i xj t transition to xi transition from xi m 1 k 0 k 6 1 i k xi t death di xi t 3 2 these equations produce the following system dx 0 t dt x 0 t m 1 j 1 j 0 xj t m 1 k 1 0 k d 0 x 0 t 3 3 dx 1 t dt m 1 j 0 j 6 1 j 1 xj t m 1 k 0 k 6 1 1 k d 1 x 1 t dxm 1 t dt m 2 j 0 j m 1 xj t m 2 k 0 m 1 k dm 1 xm 1 t 4 model calibration the probability that a cell will remain in x 0 after radiation is p 0 0 therefore the average number of births in one day after applying the kth dose fraction and just before the k 1 th dose fraction is equal to n k x 0 k p 0 0 x 0 k 1 q m 4 1 4 as seen in eq 4 1 the newborn cells population size is proportional to x 0 therefore the birth rate can be taken as 1 q m 4 2 lemma 4 1 suppose that a cell has i deactivated target s just before the application of a dose fraction and pr after treatment and repair 1 i j represents the probability that a cell with i deactivated target s just before the application of a dose fraction has j deactivated target s right before the application of the next dose fraction 2 an average number of xi i j cells move from xi into xj 3 for fixed m and k 1 the map i k i m is increasing proof 1 suppose that pr therefore i j m k 0 p i k r k j 4 3 eq 2 2 shows that r m j 0 for j m therefore i j m 1 k 0 p i k r k j 4 4 now assume that a cell has i deactivated targets just before applying a dose frac tion after radiation and right before the repair mechanism this cell may remain in subpopulation xi with probability p i i or it may move to subpopulation xk k i 1 m 1 with probability p i k following repair this cell may move from subpopulation xk to subpopulation xj with probability r k j therefore the probability of transitioning from subpopulation xi into subpopulation xj after treat ment and repair one day is i j 2 the effect of treatment and repair on one cell is independent of the rest of the cells therefore the average number of cells moving from subpopulation xi into subpopula tion xj is equal to xi i j 3 see 20 the following corollary is a direct consequence of lemma 4 1 5 corollary 4 1 with the same assumptions described in lemma 4 1 1 the cells transition rate from subpopulation xi into subpopulation xj is equal to i j i j day 1 2 the death rate of subpopulation xi is di i m day 1 remark 4 1 according to lemma 4 1 we can separate the tumor cells into different sub populations according to their sensitivity to the radiation therefore the death rate in a subpopulation with more deactivated targets is higher than a subpopulation with fewer deac tivated targets which can be interpreted as the treatment heterogeneity in the model now starting with subpopulation x 0 cells give birth at a constant rate of 1 q m day 1 in addition cells transit from subpopulation xi into subpopulation x 0 at a rate of i 0 day 1 conversely cells move from subpopulation x 0 into subpopulation xi at a rate of 0 i day 1 or may die at a rate of 0 m day 1 where is the transition matrix hence for i 0 m 1 we have m l 0 l i 1 4 5 by substituting eq 4 5 in eq 3 1 we get dx 0 t dt 0 0 1 q m 1 x 0 t m 1 l 1 l 0

substituting eq 4 6 and eq 4 8 in eq 3 3 the tumor growth model is 6 described by dx 0 t dt 0 0 1 q m 1 x 0 t m 1 l 1 l 0 xl t 4 9 dx 1 t dt 1 1 1 x 1 t m 1 l 0 l 6 1 l 1 xl t dxm 1 t dt m 1 m 1 1 xm 1 t m 2 l 0 l m 1 xl t with initial conditions x 0 n 0 0 0 5 tumor lifespan what dose magnitude is required to remove the tumor completely a small number of cells may still remain after resection that are not visible and detectable by mri therefore it is crucial to know how many dose fractions must be applied to eliminate the remaining cancerous cells the tumor lifespan is defined as the minimum number of dose fractions required to remove the entire tumor 24 therefore based on tumor population dynamics the tumor lifespan is defined as l min btc bn t c 0 5 1 where n t m 1 l 0 xl t n btc 5 2 6 stability analysis suppose that m is an arbitrary integer system 4 9 can be written as x t a q r x t 6 1 where matrix a is described as atk 0 0 1 q m 1 i j 0 i i 1 i j and i 6 0 j i i 6 j 6 2 7 where t i 1 and k j 1 therefore a 11 0 0 1 q m 1 and for 2 t m att t 1 t 1 1 6 3 i i 1 let am m atk be a complex matrix for t 1 m let rt k 6 t atk denote the sum of the absolute values of the non diagonal entries in the t th row and d att rt be the closed disc centered at att with radius rt which is known as gershgorin disc eigenvalue of a lies within at least one of the gershgorin discs d att rt gershgorin theorem 25 lemma 6 1 suppose that b a if rt defines as rt k 6 t btk 6 4 then 1 rt 0 6 5 2 btt rt 1 q m qm i 0 q m i 1 i m 1 6 6 proof 1 according to 6 2 for 1 t m rt k 6 t btk j 6 i i j 0 6

qm i 6 9 the main result of this section is written as follows theorem 6 1 for any m 2 0 1 and 0 r 1 the system x a q r x is stable at equilibrium point 0 where q 0 5 proof it is enough to show that all eigenvalues of matrix a have negative real parts to provide this we will show that for any q 0 5 0 r 1 and m 2 any point of gershgorin circles d att rt have negative real part where 1 t m for this purpose we apply gershgorin theorem on matrix b a based on lemma 6 1 btt rt 1 q m qm i 0 q m i 1 i m 1 6 10 note that the function qm is an increasing function for q 0 and m is an integer therefore for 1 q 0 5 q we have 1 q m 1 q m qm 6 11 where 0 1 consequently btt r and btt rt 0 where q 0 5 figure 2 this shows that the gershgorin circles belong to the left half of real line in addition according to gershgorin theorem each eigenvalue of matrix b belongs in one of gershgorin discs therefore each eigenvalue of matrix b has negative real part hence every eigenvalue of matrix a has negative real part this completes the proof theorem 6 2 suppose that m 2 is an integer a mm m and the set s denotes the value q such that the system 6 1 is stable corresponding to all 0 r 1 and 0 1 then inf q a 0 5 6 12 proof according to theorem 6 1 the system 4 9 is stable for q 0 5 now for any 0 corresponding to q 0 0 5 and for m 2 there exists r 0 1 such that the system 4 9 is unstable hence inf q a 0 5 6 13 9 figure 2 gershgorin disc b att rt 7 conclusion in this study the population dynamics of tumor cells in the process of radiotherapy was examined a system of differential equations
