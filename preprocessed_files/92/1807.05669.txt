lolfcm imu edu cn mailto pyzlr imu edu cn abstract the nuclear dna amount in angiosperms is studied from the eigen value equation of the genome evolution operator h the operator h is introduced by physical simulation and it is defined as a function of the genome size n and the derivative with respective to the size the discontinuity of dna size distribution and its synergetic occurrence in related angiosperms species are successfully deduced from the solution of the equation the results agree well with the existing experimental data of aloe clarkia nicotiana lathyrus allium and other genera it may indicate that the evolutionary constrains on angiosperm genome are essentially of quantum origin key words genome size dna amount evolution angiosperms quantum introduction dna amount is relatively constant and tends to be highly characteristic for a species the nuclear dna amounts of angiosperm plants were estimated by at least eight different techniques and mainly over 96 by flow cytometry and feulgen microdensitometry the c values for more than 6000 angiosperm species were reported till 2011 1 it is found that these c values are highly variable differing over 1000 fold changes in dna amount in evolution often appear non random in amount and distribution 2 4 one big surprise is the discovery of the large differences in dna amounts between related plant species while preserving the strictly proportional change in all chromosomes 2 3 5 as early as in 1980 s narayan discovered the discontinuous dna distribution in four angiosperm genera and named it as the quantum mode of c value progression 6 7 the discontinuous distribution of nuclear dna amounts in angiosperm genera is rather common it was also observed in genus rosa 8 both mechanisms on genome size increase and on genome size reduction in plant evolution were proposed 2 3 9 12 it was suggested that in plants the genome sizes increase due to the proliferation of long terminal repeats ltr retrotransposons 9 while the mechanism of genome reduction may be due to many small deletions 10 or some unknown force removing ltr retrotransposons and excess dna 11 however all these works cannot explain the law on the quantum pattern of the discontinuous dna distribution in angiosperms in the manuscript we shall introduce a genome evolution operator h called hamiltonian in physics and use the eigen functions of the operator to deduce the distribution of dna amount for a species or genus therefore the law obeyed by the statistical distribution of genome size is similar to the eigen equation of observables in quantum mechanics and this equation can easily be generalized to the time dependent form and used as a guard for studying the plant genome evolution results genome evolution operator n n h to describe the discontinuous patterns of genome size distribution we simulate the genome evolution by a physical system the system is characterized by a genome evolution operator n n h where n is the genome size we assume the eigenvalue and the eigen function of h describe the organization of dna amounts assume 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 l l v n n n c cn n h 1 the hamiltonian includes the kinetic term 2 2 2 2 l c n and the potential term 2 2 v n n n l c is an evolution related constant for a family or a genus of species and are environment related parameters without loss of generality one may assume much smaller than 2 the eigenvalue e and eigen function n obey the schrodinger equation n e n h 2 that describes the steady states of the chromosome organization of the evolving species the solution of eq 2 is generally discontinuous the discrete eigenvalues of hamiltonian characterize the quantum states of the genome size and the corresponding eigen function gives the distribution of genome size namely 2 n dn representing the occurring probability of size n in the state n the probability distribution may peak at one value or several values as the probability peaks at two or more values it means the nuclear dna amounts varying in that species the solutions of the eigenvalue equation 2 or its explicit form 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 l n n n e n c n 3 are 2 1 2 8 0 1 2 2 4 n l e e n n c 4 and 2 2 0 1 2 1 1 4 0 1 0 2 2 2 exp 2 1 2 4 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 n n n n n n l n d c n n c h h h h h h nh c n n n ld 5 n c is normalization constant the function nh is called hermite polynomial in mathematics it is easily shown that the probability distribution of ground state n 0 peaks at 0 or 0 2 2 n n the probability of the first excited state n 1 having two peaks at 1 and 1 and the probability of the second excited state n 2 having three peaks at 5 2 0 and 5 2 etc discontinuous distribution of dna amounts of long and short chromosomes in aloe the aloaceae is one of the most stable angiosperm families as far as gross chromosome morphology and basic number are concerned the genome size of all species is bimodal with several long chromosomes and several short ones in the diploid the 4 c dna amounts were studied for 20 aloe species and it was found the overall dna amounts can be divided into long and short chromosome categories the ratios of dna amount between long and short chromosome are very close to 4 6 1 for 20 species 5 this provides a striking example of karyotypic orthoselection but its mechanism is unknown we shall explain it as the quantum pattern of genome size suppose the genomes of the studied 20 aloe species are all in the first excited states n 1 from eq 5 one has the probability density of genome size of the first excited state 2 2 2 0 1 0 4 exp n n n n const n n d d 6 it follows that the probability density peaks at 0 0 n n n d for long chromosomes n n n d for short chromosomes 7 therefore one has 0 0 1 1 2 2 2 2 tot tot tot n nd d n n n n n n n 7 1 where 0 2 tot n n 2 d n n the two parameters have been defined by eq 5 note that 0 n is also the dna amount or genome size of the ground state 0 n and d means the width of the size distribution in ground state eq 7 1 gives the dna amount ratio between long and short chromosomes of n 1 state from eq 5 one has 5 4 3 4 0 2 2 l cd n which is a constant for aloe family therefore the theory predicts the dna amounts of long and short dna fall into two straight lines in the figure of n and n versus tot n the comparisons between theory and experiments are shown in figure 1 we found the theory of nuclear dna distribution is in good agreement with the experimental data moreover the experimental data 4 6 n n gives 2 0 0 413 d n that implies the relation of parameters 3 2 0 292 l c as assuming much smaller than 2 for aloeceae family insert figure 1 here discontinuous distribution of nuclear dna amount in four genera clarkia nicotiana lathyrus and allium the discontinuous distribution of nuclear dna amount also occurs in other angiosperms the 2 c dna values of 125 species divided into four genera clarkia nicotiana lathyrus and allium were studied and they show the same discontinuous distribution of 4 8 groups 4 groups for clarkia 7 groups for nicotiana and 8 groups for lathyrus and allium it was reported that the group means occur at regular intervals averaging approximately 2 pg in clarkia and nicotiana and approximately 4 pg in lathyrus and allium 7 the above empirical laws can be explained naturally in the present theory insert table 1 here set the distribution of genome size in quantum state n peaks at 1 1 n i i n the expression of wave function n n in eq 5 shows the dna amount n in quantum state n always peaks at 0 1 1 n n i i n n n n i i i i n n d n n d 8 since n i is discrete in given quantum state n the genome size always shows nodal distribution from the eigen function n n given by eq 5 the positions of peaks of genome size are determined by an algebraic equation of parameter the equations for n 0 to n 7 and their roots n i are listed in table 1 since the adjacent roots n i and 1 n i depart each other by a number of 1 to 2 approximately one has 1 n n i i n n approximately equal d to 2 d for each quantum state n because d is a constant for a given genus the group means of dna amount should occur at regular intervals of d to 2 d generally the theoretical value of nuclear dna amount n i n can be predicted by eq 8 through two parameters 0 n and d two parameters are estimated by 0 1 1 n i i n n n 9 1 1 1 av n n i i n n i i n n d 10 where av means the average over i the parameters 0 n and d can also be estimated through minimization of the deviation 2 2 1 exp n n i i iterms n n n here exp n i n represents the experiment value of n i n 7 and nterms means the number of predicted species for given n the minimization leads to the estimation eq 9 and 0 2 2 exp n n i i i n i i n n d 11 assume the nuclear dna distribution of clarkia is in the excited quantum state of n 3 nicotiana in quantum state n 6 lathyrus in quantum state n 7 and allium in quantum state n 7 the comparisons between theoretical prediction and experimental data of nuclear dna amounts for four genera are shown in table 2 insert table 2 and table 2 a here from table 2 we found the theoretical predictions 1 n i n th and 2 n i n th agree well with experimental data if the possible errors existing in group means of 2 c dna see ref 7 are taken into account the studied genera clarkia nicotiana and lathyrus have complete dna amount data the standard deviation for these three genera takes 0 191 0 335 and 1 076 respectively from our quantum pattern model for comparison we consider another measure by introducing empirical spacing parameter 1 1 n n n n n n n and use the equal spacing model to simulate the experimental data of these genera the standard deviation takes 0 419 0 415 and 1 42 respectively explicitly higher than the deviations calculated from the quantum pattern model table 2 a the nuclear dna distribution is a property fundamental to the complex organization of angiosperm genomes above studies proves that in these four genera the amounts of dna form regular nodes along the entire sequence the agreement between theory and experiments shows that the quantum mechanism governing the discontinuous pattern of dna distribution is an acceptable assumption and this mechanism may be common to many plant genera the parameters 0 n and d are related to more fundamental evolutionary parameters l c and the value reflects the environmental influence on the genus and l c reflects the inherent characteristics of the genus from the values of 0 n and 2 d listed in table 2 by using eq 5 one obtains l c ranging from 0 7 to 2 8 pg 3 2 and from 0 03 to 0 19 pg 1 for four genera the evolutionary parameters of these four plant genera take roughly similar values it provides an explanation why their nuclear dna amounts show the nearly same discontinuous distribution discontinuous nuclear dna amount and quantum state in rosa the above method can be used to study discontinuous distributions of nuclear dna amounts in other species of angiosperms the dna amount can always be expressed by quantum states n i s i 1 2 n 1 where n 0 means ground state and 1 n means excited state as an example we study nuclear dna amounts in roses the 2 c dna amounts of rose species for four subgenera were estimated by using flow cytometry and feulgen microdensitometry as summarized in ref 8 8 three subgenera have only one species and each of them should be classified as the quantum ground state 0 1 s the fourth subgenus eurosa contains 120 species grouped into ten sections several discrete values of the 2 c dna amounts were taken in section carolinae cinamomeae and pimpinellifoliae we define the nuclear quantum states of all species in subgenus eurosa in table 3 the distribution parameters of dna amounts 0 n d and the parameter 3 2 l c see discussion section are also calculated for each quantum state and given in table 3 we have found quantum states n i s of n 3 6 7 in clarkia nicotiana lathyrus and allium and n 1 in aloe now the quantum states n i s of n 0 1 and 2 are found in genus rosa it is expected that all low excited quantum states can be found in the genera of angiosperms in addition to the discreteness of the eigenvalue discontinuous pattern the peculiarity of a quantum state is the statistical distribution of the genome size which possibly takes several different values following statistical law the probability of genome size taking n to n dn is proportional to 2 n dn by use of eq 5 we can deduce the approximately same probabilities at different peaks of 2 n insert table 3 here discussions two phases of genome evolution and the mechanical simulation of evolutionary theory the nuclear genomes in angiosperms exhibit extensively variation in size the size variation has become an important part of the problem of genome macroevolution paleobiological studies indicated that species usually change more rapidly during rather than between speciation events the smooth evolution always occurs between speciation events and the sudden evolution preferably occurs during speciation 13 we call the former as the evolution in classical phase because the phyletic gradualism obeys the classical evolutionary law while the fossil record does not always show smooth evolutionary transitions punctuated equilibrium states mean that evolution is fast at times of splitting speciation and comes to a halt stasis between splits 14 in fact the creation of new gene loci with previously nonexistent functions during speciation requires the big and rapid leap in genome evolution and that is difficult to be understood by the classical evolution theory merely based on natural selection due to the abrupt and stochastic nature of speciation events we attribute the evolution during speciation to the non classical or the quantum phase alternative occurrence of classical and non classical phase can be explained in a unifying evolutionary theory as follows suppose the frequency of aptamer k mer serves the dynamical variables of the genome 15 set the frequency 1 4 k i x i m and i x n genome length or size are the function of evolutionary time t they obey a set of second order differential equations with respect to t by use of mechanical simulation one may introduce kinetic energy potential and hamiltonian of the system the advantage of the evolution expressed in the form of second order differential equations is that it can easily be transformed into a quantum equation see supplementary data a arxiv 1411 2205 when the evolutionary inertia parameter c 2 in equations is small enough during speciation the classical mechanical equations are automatically transformed into the quantum schrodinger equation that can describe the genome evolution in quantum phase the approach was applied in the discussion of avian genome evolution it was found that as c decreases to the thousandth of the classical value the avian genome evolution enters into quantum phase see supplementary data b biorxiv 2015 034710 more than 6000 angiosperm species have been studied and their dna amounts are highly variable differing over 1000 fold the species diversification is a process of consecutively alternative occurrence of classical and quantum phases of evolution during speciation the genome evolution is in quantum phase denoted by n with n 0 representing dna amount singlet and n 1 representing dna amount multiplet then after speciation the evolution enters to the classical phase where the component n i s i 1 2 n 1 in each given i evolves as a new species moves on classical trajectory until next round of speciation genome size variations it was proposed that the genome sizes increase in angiosperms is due to the proliferation of long terminal repeat ltr retrotransposons and the accumulation of several thousand new transposable elements in the long term of evolution 9 simultaneously it was suggested that the dna loss from large scale rearrangements is due to hundreds of thousands of small deletions in noncoding dna and transposons 10 11 but the transposable elements proliferation and the deletion based mutation cannot explain the genome complexity observed in discontinuous dna distribution in angiosperms recently the whole genome duplication wgd as a major driving force in angiosperms and other species diversification is recognized 16 18 it was found that several rounds of wgd form cycles of polyploidization and the increased diversification rates often follow wgds 19 20 however the polyploidy is often described as a somatic event of chromosome doubling and the mechanisms of chromosome doubling is unclear yet 21 in terms of polyploidization we are still unable to demonstrate how the relation of discontinuous dna size distribution in related species is established we noticed that the large scale gene duplications block duplications both on the same chromosome and on different chromosomes were studied experimentally and it was demonstrated that these events mainly result from replication accidents 22 one may assume the accidents have something to do with quantum law in this paper we suggest a new way to solve the problem of discontinuous dna distribution in angiosperms by use of the eigenvalues of the genome evolution operator h we have deduced the quantum pattern of genome size variation consistent with experimental data this is the first success of the present method secondly since l c and are two fundamental constant introduced in the operator h the quantum pattern of nuclear dna amount should depend on these two parameters the discontinuous dna amounts in related plant species should obey the law given by similar l c and and they occur synergetically this is the very reason why the large differences in dna amounts between related plant species preserve the strict proportionality such as observed in aloe to summarize the genome size variations have two remarkable characteristics the discontinuity of dna size distribution and its synergetic occurrence in related angiosperms species both they can be understood and calculated following the line of the present theory moreover the events of new species formation occur suddenly and stochastically the puzzle can also be explained by quantum evolution dimension of evolutionary parameters the dimension analysis is helpful to understand the meaning of the parameter introduced in the theory the dimension of dynamical variable n is zero since n is measured by base number however the genome size n can also be given as the mass of dna in picogram pg 1 pg 0 98 10 9 base pairs 2 3 so under the alternative definition n has dimension of mass m that is there are two dimensional systems of genomic quantity and both systems can be used in theoretical analysis genome evolution operator h and its eigenvalue e describe the discontinuous pattern of genome size having the dimension as genome size n namely dimension zero in the first dimensional system or m in the second dimensional system by the physical simulation 2 c represents the evolutionary inertia of the dynamical variables it has dimension of time 2 i e t 2 in the first dimensional system or t 2 m 1 in the second dimensional system l is a quantization parameter whose dimension is t or t m 1 in two dimensional systems respectively the parameter plays the role of n restraining potential whose dimension is zero or m 1 in two dimensional systems it is interesting to note that 3 2 l c is a dimensionless parameter in both dimensional systems from eq 4 we find the parameter is approximately proportional to the relative interval of adjacent levels 1 n n n e e e giving a measure of the quantum peculiarity of the genome in fact the parameter takes larger values for angiosperms than other species making quantum pattern more evident for these plants for quantum excited states n 0 of angiosperms that have been studied 3 2 l c takes a value between 0 03 and 0 3 however for quantum singlets n 0 the parameter is lower than above by an order of magnitude table 3 methods by using hamiltonian h eq 1 we have succeeded in deriving the discontinuous variation of dna amount in plant species the basic equation 2 is the cornerstone of the theoretical analysis that is closely related to the genome evolution the genome evolution is governed by a set of constraints fundamental to the complex organization of the system for eukaryotes the genome interaction between different species is relatively weak and the evolution can be looked as independent genomic events of single species moving on its own trajectory consider the problem of eukaryote genome macro evolution suppose the frequency of aptamer k mer serves the dynamical variables of the genome 15 set 1 4 k i x i m are the function of evolutionary time t the genome evolution can be modeled by using different mathematical approaches 23 we model the evolution by a set of differential equations of k mer frequency with respect to t we use the second order differential equation with respect to t instead of first order equation usually used such as in birth and death process modeling the reason of assuming a second order equation is it can easily be transformed to a quantum formation through feynman s path integral approach see supplementary data a arxiv 1411 2205 thus the general form of eukaryote genome evolution is assumed as 2 1 2 i m i i dx v x x x t dxd c f dt dt x dt 12 where 0 f is a dissipation coefficient representing the effect of fluctuation force note that i x n genome length or size the potential function v the negative of potential energy describes the constraints of environment and the interactions among constituents ix the parameter 2 c is introduced in eq 12 to represent the evolutionary inertia of the dynamical variables ix to give a unified description of genome evolution both in classical phase and non classical phase by the mechanical simulation of eq 12 we easily obtain its quantum generalization as 0 f 2 2 2 2 2 i i il t t x t l v t c x x x x x h h 13 here the classical evolutionary trajectory i x t is replaced by the wave function t x l is a quantization constant the quantum evolutionary equation 13 is the logic generalization of the classical equation 12 eq 12 has been applied in studying avian genome evolution see supplementary data b biorxiv 2015 034710 consider the simple case of k 1 or m 4 assume the potential 1 4 1 4 1 4 env v x x t d x x w x x t 14 d means the diversity promoting potential 4 4 1 4 2 2 log log i i i i i d x x n n x x n x 15 in literature d is called diversity measure which was firstly introduced by laxton 24 in their studies the geographical distribution of species the absolute frequencies of the species in different locations was used as a source of diversity recently the method was developed and applied successfully to various bio informatics problems for example the intron splice site recognition 25 the protein structural classification 26 the nucleosome positioning prediction 27 etc now we use it to study evolutionary problem since many examples have shown that the genome always becomes as diverse as possible and expands their own dimensionality continuously in the long term of evolution moreover assume the environmental potential envw in the simple case of k 1 is only the function of n 2 0 env i i w n n n x 16 inserting 14 15 16 into 13 we obtain 2 2 2 2 2 2 i l il t t d n n t t c x x x x xh 17 2 2 2 logi i i x x n n n d x set exp iet t l x x the stationary solution x satisfies 2 2 2 2 2 2 i l d n n e c x x x x 18 when 4 0 ix n one has 2 d n x in fact for many angiosperm plants is a small quantity for example 0 0089 for nicotiana and 2 d n x is a good approximation in this case the wave function is a function of variable n only and n satisfies eq 3 exactly therefore we have proved that the basic equation 3 the constraints on genome organization is essentially the evolutionary equation on the steady states of genome

is defined and denoted as n i s in the table the 2 c dna amount is also listed which was taken from the data given in ref 8 8 seven sections fall into the genome of ground state denoted by n 0 with one value of 2 c dna amount two sections fall into the genome of first excited state denoted by n 1 with two discrete values of 2 c dna amount one section falls into the genome of second excited state denoted by n 2 with three discrete values of 2 c dna amount 0 n and d are calculated from eq 9 and 10 and d for ground states are estimated from the standard deviation of 2 c dna amount
