type lebesgue spaces new factorizations for linear and multilinear operators are shown to follow 1 introduction let be a non atomic probability space the space of scalar valued measurable functions l 0 l 0 d is equipped with the topology of convergence in measure and f g in l 0 if f g for almost every for 0 p the lebesgue space lp is defined by f lp f p f p d 1 p of course p is a quasi norm making lp into a quasi banach space and lp is a banach space if 1 p where l is the space of essentially bounded functions equipped with the essential supremum norm for 0 p the weak lebesgue space lp is defined by f lp f p sup t 0 t f t 1 p the quantity p is a complete quasi norm see 3 ch 1 1 1 the intent of this article is to extend the existing nikishin maurey theory al though this theory is often presented in the context of factoring operators the foun dational results of this theory are concerned with bounded subsets of non negative measurable functions if f is such a set of measurable functions and 0 p nikishin 6 characterized the existence of a positive measurable function g such that sup f f f g p the existence of such a function is equivalent to the existence of a decreasing function c 0 0 such that limt c t 0 and sup j cjfj t c t for all t 0 finitely supported sequences fj from f and scalars cj satisfying j cj p 1 in other words g exists if and only if sup j cjfj n n f 1

diestel is bounded in l 0 the key step in proving g s existence from the boundedness of this set is purely constructive a nice presentation of the proof of nikishin s 6 characterization may be found in proposition iii h 2 of 8 to summarize for 0 1 the boundedness of the above set within l 0 implies the existence of a subset e of and a constant c such that e 1 and sup f f 1 e f p c of course the constant c is tied to the function c from the above maximal estimate and thus it may be that lim 0 c if this limit were finite there would be nothing to prove as the set f would be bounded in lp given any decreasing null sequence n such that 0 n 1 g is constructed by selecting an unbounded in creasing sequence of positive scalars an such that g a 11 e 1 n 1 an 1 e n e n 1 where the scalars an are chosen to counteract the growth of constants c n in order to obtain the factorization f g g 1 f where g 1 f is bounded in lp of course any selection of scalars an defines g as a positive element of l 0 however it is of interest to identify a more specific space for g based on the particular function c t from the above maximal estimate theorem 1 1 is a formulation of nikishin s theorem for the specific case that f is a subset of lq for some 0 q p in this case it is natural to consider c t t q much of the proof follows from a technical adaptations of the arguments used to prove nikishin s 6 theorem as presented in 8 however the aforementioned construction of the function g is insufficient to obtain g from the natural weak lebesgue space and an extra compactness argument will be used to prove n 3 n 1 theorem 1 1 let 0 q p 1 r 1 q 1 p and f be a subset of non negative elements of lq then the following conditions are equivalent n 1 there exists a constant c and a positive g lr so that g r 1 and sup f f f g p c n 2 there exists a constant c so that sup j cjfj q c j cj p 1 p for all finitely supported sequences fj from f and scalars cj n 3 there exists a constant c such that for any 0 1 there exists a measurable set e such that e 1 and sup f f 1 e f p c 1 r theorem 1 1 will be proven in section 3 section 2 contains applications related to the factorization of linear and multilinear operators for more on nikishin maurey theory and its applications to banach space theory the reader is referred to 1 8 9 and 10 2 factoring operators the topology of any locally bounded topological vector space x is induced by a function x 0 satisfying the following conditions 1 x 0 for all x 6 0 running head 3 2 cx c x for all scalars c and all x x 3 there exists 1 c so that x y c x y for all x y x the function is called a quasi norm and x is a quasi banach space if x is complete with respect to furthermore if c 1 then x is a banach space for 0 p 2 a quasi banach space x has rademacher type p if there exists a constant tp x such that e j jxj p tp x p j xj p for all finitely supported sequences xj from x here j is a sequence of inde pendent bernoulli random variables satisfying p j 1 1 2 p j 1 for k 1 and quasi banach space s x 1 xk t x 1 xk l 0 is k sublinear if each coordinate map is sublinear if each coordinate map is linear then t is a k linear operator in 2 it was shown that for a bounded k sublinear operator t x 1 xk l 0 there exists a decreasing function c 0 0 such that limt c t 0 and sup j t x 1 j xk j t c t for all finitely supported sequences xi j j from xi 1 i k such that j x 1 j xk j p 1 where 1 p 1 p 1 1 pk and 0 p 1 pk 2 are the respective rademacher types of the quasi banach spaces x 1 xk thus by nikishin s 6 characteriza tion there exists a positive measurable g so that g 1 t x 1 xk p x 1 xk for all xi xi 1 i k of course the case k 1 is due to nikishin 6 analogous results are also shown in 2 for operators mapping into lq for some 0 q p these results utilize pisier s 7 characterization for the factorization of subsets of lq through lp if 0 q p maurey 5 characterized when a subset of lq may be factored through lp for 0 q p due to the stable laws and the kahane khintchine inequalities this result only applies to linear operators defined on a space of type 2 i e every linear operator t x lq factors through l 2 if 0 q 2 there are no direct applications of maurey s 5 results for factoring multilinear operators through lp using rademacher type however partial analogs of maurey s 5 result are shown to hold in 2 and 4 suppose x 1 and x 2 have type 2 and t x 1 x 2 l 0 is a bounded bilinear operator then not only does t factor through l 1 but the range of t is locally convex in l 0 this is shown in 2 as an application of the characterization of the rademacher decoupling property for quasi banach spaces given in 4 thus the t induced linear map is continuous from the projective tensor product x 1 x 2 into l 0 this means that t factors through a banach space i e there exists a banach space z a bilinear operator b x 1 x 2 z and a linear operator l z l 0 such that t lb as with previously existing nikishin maurey theorems theorem 1 1 applies to linear and multilinear operators due to their homogeneity see 2 suppose k 1 4 geoff diestel and 0 p 1 pk 2 are the respective rademacher types of the quasi banach spaces x 1 xk if 1 p 1 p 1 1 pk and t x 1 xk lq is a bounded k linear operator and 0 q p then the kahane khintchine inequalities imply that there exists a constant c c q p 1 pk t such that j 1 jk t x 1 j 1 xk jk 2 1 2 q c k i 1 ji xi ji pi 1 pi for all finitely supported sequences xi j j from xi 1 i k of course this estimate implies that sup j t x 1 j xk j q c k i 1 j xi j pi 1 pi for all finitely supported sequences xi j j from xi 1 i k as illustrated in 4 and 2 the homogeneity of t and of the identity 1 p 1 p 1 1 pk implies sup j t x 1 j xk j q c j x 1 j xk j p 1 p for all finitely supported sequences xi j j from xi 1 i k an immediate consequence of this estimate and theorem 1 1 is the following theorem 2 1 let k 1 0 p 1 pk 2 1 p 1 p 1 1 pk 1 q 1 r 1 q 1 p and suppose t x 1 xk lq is a continuous k linear operator where p 1 pk are the respective rademacher types of the quasi banach spaces x 1 xk then there exists a positive g lr such that g 1 t x 1 xk p x 1 xk for all xi xi 1 i k theorem 2 1 identifies new factorizations not established by the characterizations of nikishin 6 maurey 5 or pisier 7 due the the fact that the operator takes values in lq and that the factorization t g g 1 t is defined by an element of g of lr where 1 r 1 q 1 p 3 proof of theorem 1 1 all nikishin maurey characterizations like theorem 1 1 may be reduced to any particular value of p by considering f t f t f f for any t 0 since 1 r 1 q 1 p it follows that 1 r t 1 q t 1 p t and all the conditions n 1 n 3 translate into equivalent conditions about f t picking t so that p t has a particular value and proving the equivalence of these new conditions for f t implies the general equivalence of n 1 n 3 the following proof of n 1 n 2 n 3 follows from a technical reworking of the arguments used to prove the analogous implications of nikishin s 6 theorem as presented in 8 however the aforementioned constructive arguments used to prove the final implication of nikshin s 6 theorem are insufficient to construct the function g from n 1 because of the added requirement that g lr where running head 5 1 r 1 q 1 p however assuming n 3 and using the aforementioned reduction with the assumption that r 2 one may construct a sequence gn such that sup n sup f f f gn p and sup n gn rn where 2 rn r and rn is increasing to r thus gn is bounded in l 2 and the banach saks theorem guarantees that gn has a subsequence with convergent cesa ro means the above two conditions will be used to show that the limit g of these cesa ro means will satisfy n 1 and this will complete the proof by establishing n 3 n 1 proof assuming n 1 let fj be a finitely supported sequence from f cj be scalars and define f supj cjfj then 1 r 1 q 1 p implies f q f g p g r since fj is a finitely supported sequence from f there is a partition ej of so that f ckfk almost everywhere on ek the disjointness of the partition implies f g t k ckfk g t hence n 1 implies sup j cjfj g t k ckfk t ct p k ck p and n 2 follows with same constant as in n 1 because g r 1 now assume n 2 holds without loss of generality assume c 1 by normalizing f fix 0 1 and consider a measurable set b to be bad if there exists f f so that b f p p q for all b if there are no bad sets for some 0 1 then for every f f and every t 0 there exists f t so that f t tp f t f p p q in this case f is bounded in lp and n 3 follows in a trivial manner suppose there are bad sets for every 0 1 fix and suppose bj is a maximal family of disjoint bad sets thus for each j there exists fj f so that bj fj p p q for all bj for each j let cj bj 1 p notice that sup j cjfj p p q everywhere on b jbj thus for any n n n 2 implies that nj 1 bj sup j n cjfj 1 q n j 1 cj p q p b q p 6 geoff diestel letting n tend to infinity implies that b 1 q p therefore b p p q so if e p p q b then e p p q 1 p p q and e p p q is not bad therefore 1 e p p q f pp p q this holds for all 0 1 by making the substitution p p q then for every 0 1 the condition 1 r 1 q 1 p implies that there exists e such that e 1 and 1 e f p p p q q p r by undoing the assumed normalization of n 2 it follows that n 3 holds with the same constant as in n 2 assume n 3 with c 1 moreover the fact that f is a set of positive measurable functions the homogeneity of the desired estimates on the indices q p and r due to the identity 1 r 1 q 1 p allows for the assumption that r 2 fix n and let n m m be the sequence defined by n m 1 2 mn m for each m let en m be the set e n m from condition n 3 for n m the decreasing nature of the sequence n m m implies we may assume with no loss of generality that en m en m 1 for all n and m moreover since is non atomic we may assume en m 1 1 2 mn by choosing en m as a subset of e n m if necessary thus for every n and each m 1 en m 1 en m 1 2 mn 1 2 m 1 n m 1 n mn 2 mn m 1 n n 2 mn 1 let dn 1 en 1 and dn m en m 1 en m for all m 1 suppose the above construction has been made for all n for each n define a measurable function gn by gn m 1 dn mm n k r where k is chosen so that pk r 1 clearly gn 1 on for all n let rn rn n k then rn increases to r furthermore it is easy to see that there is a constant c which is independent of n so that gn t m tr n k dn m m tr n k n 2 mn 1 ct rn n k thus supn gn rn moreover if f f then f gn t m dn m f tm n k r since dn m e n m n 3 and our choice of k imply that there is a constant c c p q r which is independent of n so that f gn t t p m 2 p rmnp rm p n k r t p 2 p r m m pk r ct p running head 7 since r 2 and rn is increasing to r we may restrict our attention to all n such that 2 rn r without loss of generality we may assume that r 1 2 since is a probability measure sup n gn 2 c r 1 sup n gn rn by the banach saks theorem for l 2 there exists a subsequence gnk k and g l 2 so that g lim n gn in l 2 where gn n 1 n j 1 gnj for any m 1 define gn m n 1 n m 1 j m gnj by a simple application of the triangle inequality it is easy to see that g is the l 2 limit of gn m n for any m by fatou s lemma g t lim inf n gn m t for any m however since rn is increasing and is a probability measure notice that gn m is an average of functions whose lrm norms are uniformly bounded in m by a constant independent of n so there exists a constant c p q so that sup m g rm c p q since is a probability measure and rm increases to r it follows that g lr with g r c p q fix f f again by applying fatou s lemma f g t lim inf n f gn t by the arithmetic geometric mean inequality gn n j 1 gnj 1 n therefore by ho lder s inequality for weak type spaces f gn t t p f gn p p t p n i 1 f 1 n g 1 nni p np t p n i 1 f gni p n p by normalizing g in lr the condition supn supf f f gn p implies there is a constant c such that sup f f f g p c and n 1 follows 8 geoff diestel references 1 f albiac and n kalton topics in banach spaces springer new york
