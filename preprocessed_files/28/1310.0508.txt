existence and soap film regularity of solutions to plateau s problem j harrison department of mathematics university of california berkeley h pugh mathematics department stony brook university abstract plateau s problem is to find a surface with minimal area spanning a given boundary our paper presents a theorem for codimension one surfaces in rn in which the usual homological definition of span is replaced with a novel algebraic topological notion in particular our new definition offers a significant improvement over existing homological definitions in the case that the boundary has multiple connected components let m be a connected oriented compact manifold of dimension n 2 and s the collection of compact sets spanning m using hausdorff spherical measure as a notion of size we prove theorem there exists an x 0 in s with smallest size any such x 0 contains a core x 0 s with the following properties it is a subset of the convex hull of m and is a e in the sense of n 1 dimensional hausdorff measure a real analytic n 1 dimensional minimal submanifold if n 3 then x 0 has the local structure of a soap film furthermore set theoretic solutions are elevated to current solutions in a space with a rich continuous operator algebra introduction one of the classical problems in the calculus of variations is to prove the existence of a surface of least area spanning a given jordan curve in euclidian space the problem was first posed by lagrange lag 61 in 1760 and lebesgue leb 02 called it plateau s problem after joseph plateau pla 73 who experimented with films of oil and wire frames history in 1930 douglas dou 31 solved the problem for surfaces which arise as the image of a disk via minimization of an energy functional 1 his method was extended by douglas and courant cou 50 to surfaces of higher topological type bounding disjoint systems of jordan curves in 1960 federer and fleming ff 60 used integral currents with a given algebraic boundary to model films and minimized current mass see 1 2 instead of energy or area of a surface in dimension 7 and lower their solutions turned out to be oriented submanifolds at the same time reifenberg rei 60 a approached the problem from an entirely different direction for each m reifenberg chose a subgroup l of the c ech homology of m with coefficients in a compact abelian group e g z 2 z z 3 z or r z a set x m was said to be a surface with boundary 1 see rad 30 for an extensive report of work before 1930 1 ar x iv 1 31 0 05 08 v 2 m at h d g 1 2 s ep 2 01 5 2 j harrison h pugh l if l was in the kernel of the homomorphism of homology induced by the inclusion m x he concluded there was a surface with boundary l depending on these two choices that had smallest hausdorff spherical measure reifenberg s approach yielded a case by case analysis and two cases have considerable historical interest using z 2 z coefficients he found a minimizer in a collection containing all orientable and non orientable surfaces in r 3 with a given boundary excluding from consideration non manifold surfaces with triple junctions or other such singularities this theorem improved that of douglas and courant because it considered surfaces of arbitrary genus simultaneously and solved the non orientable problem his second special case used r z coefficients to deal with more complicated spanning sets specifically those compact sets x m with no retraction x m this collection contained surfaces with triple junctions and other singularities but his theorem was limited in that the boundary was required to be a single closed curve or in higher dimensions a topological sphere for more general boundaries he gave no single unifying result as he had for boundaries which were single topological spheres for example consider the disjoint union of a disk and a circle in r 3 there is no retraction to the pair of circles yet we would not want to consider this as an admissible spanning set as another example consider the surfaces xi i 1 2 3 in figure 1 any one could be a surface with minimal area depending on the distance between the circles but a simple computation see proposition 5 0 1 shows there is no non trivial collection of reifenberg surfaces which contains all three simultaneously thus one would have to find an appropriate group of coefficients and subgroup of homology which would produce the correct minimizer and this task would change depending on the configuration of the circles in the ambient space our goal was therefore to find a unifying solution similar to reifenberg s r z solution for spherical boundaries that simultaneously dealt with a large collection of reasonable surfaces including those with soap film singularities spanning a boundary more general than a topological sphere x 1 x 2 m x 3 figure 1 m is the disjoint union of three circles x 1 is homeomorphic to a cylinder and x 2 and x 3 are both homeomorphic to a cylinder union a disc all three sets span m and are thus in our collection each is a reifenberg surface for some collection but no non trivial collection of reifenberg surfaces spanning m contains x 1 x 2 and x 3 simultaneously see proposition 5 0 1 in alm 65 almgren introduced varifolds as a new approach to solving plateau s problem he announced a compactness theorem for stationary varifolds in alm 66 see also alm 65 and all 72 plateau s problem 3 this result produced a stationary varifold with minimal mass and thus solved a version of plateau s problem however solutions produced do not minimize mass over a given collection of surfaces stationary and otherwise only those that are a priori stationary for example if m r 3 is the unit circle in the xy plane the only competitors for area minimization are positive integer multiples of the unit disk to greater effect one could use his stationary varifold compactness theorem to minimize over mass or size minimizing solutions found using other techniques since those solutions ought to give rise to stationary varifolds however the limiting surface is only guaranteed to be a stationary varifold and may not necessarily span the boundary in any algebraic sense related to this is the longstanding open problem to establish almost everywhere regularity of stationary varifolds of dimension at least two see e g bom 79 lel 12 almgren used c ech homology to define spanning sets in alm 68 much as in rei 60 a and made significant advances by minimizing size with respect to elliptic functionals and extending the coef ficient groups to finitely generated abelian groups his proof of both existence and a e regularity built upon a number of ideas in rei 60 a for z coefficients his a e regularity result for elliptic functionals f extended the celebrated result of de giorgi dg 61 where f 1 while de giorgi s results were influenced by methods developed by caccioppoli cac 27 differential chains a type of current see below have a compactness theorem and a cut and paste procedure a particular subtype film chains models all soap films and solves the boundary problem for triple junctions and mo bius strips these are not rectifiable currents although size minimizing film chains have rectifiable supports furthermore film chains avoid the problem of high multiplicity seen in mass minimizing problems as discussed in dp 09 a new definition of span using linking numbers let m be an n 2 dimensional compact orientable submanifold of rn n 2 we say that a circle s embedded in rn m is a simple link of m if the absolute value of the linking number 2 l s mi of s with one of the connected components mi of m is equal to one and l s mj 0 for the other connected components mj of m j 6 i we say that a compact subset x rn spans m if every simple link of m intersects x if m is a sphere x m and there is no retraction x m then x spans m see proposition 5 0 3 if x is a manifold with boundary m then x spans m the sets x 1 x 2 x 3 in figure 1 span m see 5 for more properties one can drop the condition that m be a manifold by specifying particular n 2 cycles for which s to link for example m can be a frame such as the n 2 skeleton of an n cube differential chains our approach to plateau s problem begins with a topological vector space of de rham currents called differential chains 3 introduced in har 93 hara har 11 and har 14 a and developed by the authors in pug 09 and hp 12 the space of differential chains on a riemann ian manifold m is a differential graded topological vector space defined as an inductive limit of a sequence of banach spaces beginning with the space of whitney sharp chains and such that the boundary operator takes one space to the next these banach spaces brk are completions of the 2 given some choice of orientation of m and s the definition being independent of this choice 3 there is now a growing theory of differential chains with a number of applications unrelated to plateau s problem in progress 4 j harrison h pugh space of finitely supported sections of the k th exterior power of the tangent bundle of m 4 equipped with a decreasing sequence of geometrically defined norms br the linking maps are inclusions and the dual banach spaces consist of increasingly differentiable bounded differential k forms if m is compact the linking maps between these banach spaces are compact and this allows us to formulate compactness theorems which improve on the usual weak compactness theorems of currents in other words control of the br norm gives relative compactness in br 1 and the topology on this space is strictly finer than the inductive limit topology on differential chains which is again strictly finer than the weak topology on currents a compact k submanifold with boundary a is uniquely represented by an element a in the space b 1 k the space of sharp k chains and a b 2 k 1 represents the manifold s boundary however a is again a sharp chain so it is contained in the subspace b 1 k 1 b 2 k 1 the full space b 2 k comes into play if we instead thicken a with the extrusion operator dual to interior product then apply boundary the resulting current can be thought of as a dipole surface and it is not a sharp chain for example consider a 2 cell in r 3 its dipole version can be found as the limit limt 0 ttv t t where v is a unit vector normal to and ttv is translation through the vector tv these dipole surfaces see figures 2 and 3 which were first introduced in har 14 b play an important role in our solution to plateau s problem soap films and film chains away from triple junctions actual soap films consist of three very thin layers two layers consisting of soap on the outside and a layer of water on the inside pep 03 dipole surfaces har 14 b generalized to film chains in this paper see definition 6 0 1 nicely model the outer soapy surfaces the algebraic boundary of a dipole surface s spanning a closed loop is a dipole curve whose support is the loop consistent with the way in which the two layers of soap might meet a wire application of a cone operator see definition 1 11 1 to s produces a model of the layer of water inside application of the geometric hodge star operator of har 14 a to a dipole surface s yields a current that can be visualized as oppositely oriented dipole normal vectors to s this models the hydrophobic hydrophilic polarization of the two soap layers as also seen in lipid bilayers of cells our dipole models bypass completely the problem of triple junctions contributing to the algebraic boundary see figure 2 other branching structures similar to soap films include capillaries lightning highways and fractures dipole surfaces and film chains can be defined in arbitrary dimension and codimension and are well suited to other minimization and maximization problems involving these structures note that while these currents are not rectifiable since they do not have finite mass we do not use mass to measure area statement of our main result in our paper the word size means hausdorff spherical measure 5 sn 1 of the support of a current 4 one may think of these as infinitesimal polyhedral chains 5 hausdorff spherical measure is the same as hausdorff measure except that coverings are required to consist of balls rather than arbitrary sets the two measures are proportional and are equal on rectifiable sets hausdorff spherical measure works better for analysis however since it has upper density one a e for sets with finite measure whereas hausdorff measure does not see lemmas 4 0 3 and 4 0 4 hausdorff spherical measure also satisfies the fundamental slicing inequality of lemma 4 0 5 while hausdorff measure does not plateau s problem 5 figure 2 a dipole surface with a triple junction and its dipole boundary the triple junction is not part of the boundary the two layers of a dipole surface have opposite orientation and yet do not cancel if one glues the two y ends together with a twist the algebraic boundary of the resulting dipole surface is a single dipole curve and the support of this dipole surface is the triple mo bius band the triple mo bius band when scaled properly minimizes hausdorff measure among surfaces spanning its boundary curve it is an example of a manifold boundary with a non manifold minimizing spanning surface figure 3 a dipole mo bius strip here the dipole surface looks like a double cover this is not the case in general consider the triple junction in figure 2 there the covering would be 3 to 1 and elsewhere 2 to 1 let s m denote the collection of all compact sets which span m in particular s m in cludes orientable and non orientable manifolds of all topological types and manifolds with mul tiple junctions in section 6 we define a collection f m of film chains whose elements t satisfy 6 j harrison h pugh supp t supp t s m and supp t m we show that if x s m has finite hausdorff measure then its core 6 x supports a film chain t f m thus minimizing size in f m solves the problem of minimizing n 1 dimensional hausdorff spherical measure in s m here is our statement and solution to plateau s problem for codimension one size minimizing sur faces main theorem suppose m is an n 2 dimensional compact orientable submanifold of rn n 3 there exists an element s 0 f m with minimal size if s is any such minimizer its support x is contained in the convex hull of m has minimal n 1 dimensional hausdorff spherical measure sn 1 x in s m and is almost everywhere a real analytic n 1 dimensional minimal submanifold if n 3 x has the local structure of a soap film 7 we can restrict the collection of spanning sets s m to smaller sub collections as follows let 1 we say that a jordan curve s is an link of m if l mi s and l mj s 0 where mi and mj are as above we say that x spans m if every link of m intersects x let s m be the collection of compact subsets of rn which span m clearly s m s m k if k is a factor of by varying we obtain specialized plateau problems for example if m is the boundary circle of the mo bius strip s in r 3 then s s m 1 but s s m 2 in our proof that follows we assume 1 but the proof for 1 is essentially the same the theorem also remains true if we allow a simple link to have multiple connected components in this case when m is a sphere the spanning sets are exactly those which do not have a retract onto m in a sequel we demonstrate that our results extend to arbitrary dimension and codimension as well as to a class of continuous functionals including almgren s elliptic functionals in alm 68 we use the following generalized definition of span for higher codimension loosely dual to reifenberg s homological definition if a rn n m 1 g is a group of coefficients in the sense of eilenberg steenrod and l is a subset of h m 1 a g then x a is a surface with coboundary l if the image of the homomorphism h m 1 x g h m 1 a g induced by the inclusion a x is disjoint from l if a is an m 1 dimensional compact oriented manifold and g has a single generator then there is a natural choice for l namely the collection of those cocycles which evaluate to 1 on the fundamental cycle of a particular connected component of m and 0 on the others in the case that g z and m n 1 this choice for l yields via alexander duality our original linking number definition if one allows a simple link to have multiple components other new concepts and methods several other concepts are new and may be of use for other applications a strong compactness the compact inclusion of theorem 1 3 5 is an alternative to the usual weak compactness result for currents with bounded mass ff 60 the topology is fine enough 6 the core x of x is the support of the measure hn 1 bx i e x p x hn 1 x p r 0 for all r 0 where p r is the open ball of radius r about p and hn 1 is n 1 dimensional hausdorff measure 7 in fact x is restricted in the sense of almgren a k a almgren minimal and this implies x is almost everywhere a real analytic n 1 dimensional minimal submanifold by alm 68 1 7 soap film regularity for n 3 follows from tay 76 plateau s problem 7 to eliminate pathologies and achieve regularity yet coarse enough to have good compactness properties b a new hair cutting procedure theorem 7 1 7 is used to remove tentacles as in figure 4 and uses most of the results in this paper our procedure replaces a minimizing sequence of film chains si s 0 with a modified sequence s i s 0 whose supports converge in the hausdorff metric to the support of s 0 figure 4 long thin tentacles with small hausdorff 2 measure can converge in the hausdorff metric to a set of infinite hausdorff 2 measure c our deformation theorem 5 0 6 is fundamental to this paper and used numerous times this shows that if a spanning set is deformed then it remains a spanning set d reifenberg defines a type of sequence we call regular minimizing which satisfies lower semicontinuity of hausdorff spherical measure due to reifenberg and besicovitch 8 in rei 60 a see theorem 7 3 10 for a proper statement and proof for film chains this important result is rather buried in rei 60 a it is closely related to the main result of dav 03 which shows that almgren s uniformly quasiminimal sequences satisfy lower semicontinuity of hausdorff measure outline of our proof the first section reviews the results about differential chains which we need in this paper we refer readers to pug 09 har 14 a and hp 12 for figures and more details readers unfamiliar with differential chains might wish to skip this section for the first reading and use dually defined operators to have a decent idea of the rest of our paper the second section is a brief application of certain operators of differential chains to set up some simple constructions used to define film chains section three establishes a correspondence between finite borel measures and positive chains section four lists classical results of hausdorff measures of besicovitch bes 48 bes 49 section five provides entirely new results about spanning sets defined via linking numbers film chains are introduced for the first time in section six corollary 6 0 11 proves the existence of a differential chain s 0 minimizing our area functional a definition 6 0 3 on film chains our methods proving corollary 6 0 11 build upon develop and go beyond those found in har 04 and har 14 b where linking numbers were first used to define spanning currents and a related compactness theorem was established theorem 7 0 1 shows that any such s 0 is a film chain this result is the second 8 in rei 60 b reifenberg states lower semicontinuity in a suitable subsequence is proved by methods reminiscent of a s besicovitch s work here 8 j harrison h pugh part of our existence theorem and we deduce from it that s 0 is a size minimizing current its proof uses most of the results of this paper and adapts some methods of rei 60 a part of the proof of theorem 7 0 1 removes tentacles from film chains approximating our solu tion and this we do with theorem 7 1 7 a new method which improves on federer and fleming projections in particular we prove that any minimizer in t of our area functional a can be approxi mated by a sequence in f converging simultaneously in the topology of differential chains and in the hausdorff metric of their supports finally regularity follows from theorem 5 0 6 and a regularity theorem of almgren the authors are grateful to ulrich menne for his numerous exchanges regarding the history of varifolds and the work of frederick almgren subsequent works after this paper was posted on the arxiv october 1 2013 hp 13 several papers appeared which have built upon it to avoid confusion of priority we review the results here the first author s paper har 14 b with the original linking number definition for a smoothly embedded closed curve in r 3 was posted on the arxiv in 2011 harb this was extended to codimension one smoothly embedded compact submanifolds with finitely many components in rn in the authors 2013 arxiv post hp 13 instead of us ing milnor invariants which are generalizations of linking numbers to finitely many curves the authors required test loops to link once a given component and not link the rest de lellis maggi and ghiraldin lgm 15 relied upon the definition of linking numbers in hp 13 to define spanning sets and replaced methods of differential chains with methods of radon measures and geometric measure theory to provide a different proof to the main result of our paper they also used linking numbers to find solutions to sliding minimizers important in continuum mechanics pg 00 see also dav 14 an extension which we do not consider in this paper the authors extended the definition of linking numbers to arbitrary dimension and codimen sion using cohomological spanning conditions in hp 14 they pointed out that one could modify results of reifenberg rei 60 a and almgren alm 68 using cohomological spanning conditions but no details were provided de philippis de rosa and ghiraldin prg 15 extended results of lgm 15 to arbitrary dimension and codimension using linking spheres the authors posted an extension of hp 13 to

definition 1 1 1 for u open in rn let ak u denote the vector space of finitely supported functions u k rn we call ak u the space of dirac k chains in u we write an element a ak u using formal sum

set theoretic solutions without currents can use whitney s sharp norm to prove a compactness theorem to replace theorem 1 3 5 the sharp norm can be found in 1 1 1 1 4 by setting r 1 in 1 3 the remaining subsections 1 5 1 11 are used to elevate our set theoretic solutions to current solutions 10 j harrison h pugh the mass of a dirac k chain a n i 1 pi i ak u is given by a b 0 n i 1 pi i b 0

difference k chains for j between 0 and r it is shown in har 14 a theorem 3 2 1 that br u is indeed a norm on ak u for simplicity we often write br br u if u is understood from the context definition 1 3 3 let b rk b r k u be the banach space obtained by completing the normed space ak u br u elements of b rk u 0 r are called differential k chains of class b r in u the maps b rk u 1 b r k u 2 induced by inclusions u 1 u 2 are continuous moreover if r s the identity map ak u r ak u s is continuous and thus extends to a continuous map u r s k b r k u b s k u called the linking map

hausdorff and hausdorff spherical measures most of the results in the section are due to besicovitch bes 48 bes 49 and are reproduced in the first set of lemmas in rei 60 a pp 11 12 let diam x denote the diameter of x rn and let m denote the lebesgue measure of the unit m ball in r m for any x rn 0 m n and 0 define hm x inf i 1 m diam yi 2 m x i 1 yi yi rn diam yi then hm x lim 0 h m x is the normalized hausdorff m measure of x closely related to hausdorff measure is normalized hausdorff spherical measure s x this is defined in the same way except that the sets yi are required to be n balls in particular h m x sm x 2 mhm x both are metric outer measures and so the borel sets are measurable for m rectifiable sets see mat 99 definition 15 3 hm and sm are the same theorem 3 2 26 of fed 69 most results which hold for one of these measures also holds for the other there are two notable exceptions giving hausdorff spherical measure the edge for the calculus of variations in situations where it might be undesirable to assume that sets being considered are rectifiable a priori see lemmas 4 0 3 and 4 0 4 as well as lemma 4 0 5 lemma 4 0 1 vitali covering theorem for hausdorff measure suppose hm x and b is a collection of closed n balls such that for each x x and 0 there exists a ball x b with then there are disjoint balls bi b such that hm x ibi 0 proof apply theorem 2 8 of mat 99 to the measure hmbx which is a finite borel measure hence a radon measure by theorem 7 8 of fol 99 since hm and sm are comparable one can replace hm with sm in lemma 4 0 1 lemma

for our definition of span here we give some examples and prove some results needed to work with this definition in this section m is a compact oriented embedded m 1 dimensional submanifold unless otherwise noted we assume 1 m n proposition 5 0 1 for any group g of coefficients compact or otherwise the kernels of the homomorphisms j h 1 m g h 1 xj g induced by the injection maps j m xj j 1 2 3 in figure 1 have a trivial intersection thus there is no non trivial collection of reifenberg spanning sets which contains all three simultaneously proof the relevant groups are h 1 m g g g g h 1 xj g g j 1 2 3 the homo morphism 1 is given by 1 a b c a b c likewise 2 a b c a b and 3 a b c b c thus if a b c is in the kernel of all three homomorphisms then a b c 0 lemma 5 0 2 the cone cq m spans m for all q rn 22 j harrison h pugh proof if not there is a simple link n of m such that n cq m let mi be the connected component of m with l mi n 6 0 and recall l mi n is the degree of the map f mi n sn 1 s r 7 s r s r since cq m is disjoint from n the map f factors as f g h mi n h cq m n g sn 1 where h s r id and g p r p r p r so it suffices to show that h is trivial on hn 1 mi n z hm 1 mi hn mn write h id where mi cq m is given by s s since hm 1 mi z hm 1 cq m z is itself trivial it follows from naturality of the ku nneth formula that h 0 in the above lemma the only property of cq m needed is that the map on homology i hm 1 m z hm 1 cq m z induced by the inclusion m cq m is trivial so any other compact set x containing m with that condition on homology will also span m note that m x if x spans m we can say slightly more that m x m now suppose m is an n 2 sphere in rn a compact set x spans m in the sense of reifenberg s theorem 2 of rei 60 a if x contains m and there is no retraction of x onto m the next proposition shows that spanning in the sense of reifenberg s theorem 2 implies spanning in our sense proposition 5 0 3 suppose m rn is homeomorphic to an n 2 sphere and x m is compact of dimension n 1 or sufficiently of finite hausdorff n 1 measure if there is no retraction x m then x spans m proof if x does not span m there exists a simple link of m which does not intersect x the curve defines a homology class in h 1 r n x and therefore by alexander duality a c ech cohomology class in hn 2 x which extends the fundamental cocycle of m therefore there exists a retraction x m by the hopf extension theorem proposition 5 0 4 let m n 1 if x z t l is compact and spans m where z is closed and l is purely m unrectifiable then z also spans m proof suppose n is a simple link of m and n z choose a tubular neighborhood t of n with z t parameterize n by 0 2 n s 1 where x gives the coordinate of x n s 1 r 2 in polar coordinates where s 1 is the unit circle in r 2 the pullback bundle of the tubular neighborhood via is isomorphic to a cylinder c let c n denote the resulting map which is a diffeomorphism except at the endpoints where the map is 2 1 let h 1 l t since theta is lipschitz it follows that h is also purely m unrectifiable and so by the besicovitch federer projection theorem mat 99 18 1 almost every orthogonal projection h k where k is an m plane sends h to a set with lebesgue m measure zero thus there exists an arc t which is disjoint from l t whose endpoints p q lie in the same fiber of t and which is given as a smooth section of the normal bundle to n except at the endpoints where the section is discontinuous plateau s problem 23 let d be the line segment joining p and q since x is closed and x there exists 0 such that p q t is disjoint from l let t t be the neighborhood of and apply the projection theorem again to find a line segment disjoint from l t with one endpoint in p and the other in q finally connect the appropriate endpoints of and inside p and q to create a simple link of m which is disjoint from x definition 5 0 5 suppose x is compact and spans m a competitor of x with respect to m is a set x where rn rn is a lipschitz map that is the identity on bc and b b where b rn is some closed ball disjoint from m the map is called a deformation of x theorem 5 0 6 if m n 1 and x rn is compact and spans m and x is a competitor of x then x is compact and spans m proof if not then there is a simple link of m such that s 1 x let b br be a closed ball of radius r satisfying m b id on bc and b b expanding b slightly we may also assume id on an neighborhood of frb and that br br we can assume without loss of generality that is smooth approximate uniformly to within min 2 d s 1 x 2 by a smooth function let f g be a partition of unity subordinate to b r 2 bcr and define f g id then is smooth x s 1 id on bc and b b finally expand b slightly again and we may assume id on an neighborhood of frb and that br br by compactness there exists a tubular neighborhood t of s 1 so that t x since we may perturb within t let us assume without loss of generality that the intersection s 1 frb is transverse by considering a possibly smaller we may assume slightly more that within the neighborhood of frb the curve s 1 consists of radial line segments so the set s 1 b consists of a finite collection of arcs 1 n each of which intersects frb radially note that t b consists of pairwise disjoint neighborhoods ti of the arcs i minus their endpoints for each i let i ti d be the projection onto the normal m disc d determined by the tubular neighborhood t and some trivialization of the normal bundle of s 1 consider the smooth maps i i wi d where wi 1 ti for each i fix a regular value xi of i and consider the compact sets yi 1 i xi br 2 since is proper each preimage zi 1 yi is also compact as a subset of rn for each i there exists by compactness of zi a smooth compact n manifold with boundary pi wi such that zi pi and such that both line segments constituting 1 i xi br meet pi transversally and at one point each now xi is still a regular value of the restricted map i pi pi d but also xi is a regular value of i pi since i 1 pi xi 1 i xi br pi and this intersection is transverse and contained in a region on which id so by the inverse function theorem for manifolds with boundary hir 76 theorem 4 1 the set i 1 pi xi is a collection of circles and arcs that meet the boundary pi neatly since by construction the set i 1 pi xi consists of exactly two points there is exactly one arc i in 1 i xi and it joins the two points moreover the arcs i are pairwise disjoint since any point in an intersection of two must get mapped by into disjoint tubular neighborhoods furthermore the arcs i terminate inside the tubular neighborhood t of so we may smoothly extend each i within t linking the arcs together to form an embedding s 1 m c the curve 24 j harrison h pugh is also a simple link of m since is by construction regularly homotopic to thus s 1 x 6 and so s 1 x 6 but s 1 t yielding a contradiction the core of x rn is defined by x p x hm x p r 0 for all r 0 the core x of a closed set x is closed and hm x x 0 the definition of core and its properties are unaltered if hn 1 is replaced by sn 1 we say x is reduced if x x lemma 5 0 7 let m n 1 if x rn is compact and spans m then the core x is compact and spans m proof if not there is a simple link n of m and a tubular neighborhood t of n whose closure is disjoint from x so hm x t 0 let t d be the projection onto the normal m disk d determined by the tubular neighborhood t and some trivialization of the normal bundle of n then hm x t 0 and so there exists a point x d x t then 1 x is a simple link of m missing x giving a contradiction the next lemma is an easy consequence of the definition of the hausdorff metric lemma 5 0 8 if xi rn is compact and spans m for each i and xi x in the hausdorff metric then x spans m lemma 5 0 9 let m n 1 suppose x rn is compact and spans m let p rn r 0 and suppose p r m if p p r then x x p r c cp x fr p r is compact and spans m proof it is clear that x is compact if x does not span m then let be a simple link of m such that s 1 x then s 1 x p r first we observe that x fr p r 6 if not there is by compactness an neighborhood t of fr p r disjoint from x so we may construct a diffeomorphism of p r which fixes fr p r and sends to a simple link of m such that s 1 p r t thus s 1 x yielding a contradiction this implies that cp x fr p r 6 and in particular p x thus p s 1 let 0 such that p 2 s 1 p 2 m let p c rn be the identity on p r c and elsewhere the radial projection away from p and onto the frontier of p r by definition of cp it is enough to show s 1 intersects x suppose not since s 1 is compact there is an neighborhood t of s 1 such that t x let v be a smooth radial vector field on rn with center point p supported in p r and normalized so that if is the time 1 flow of v then s 1 t then is a simple link of m disjoint from x a contradiction plateau s problem 25 6 film chains throughout the rest of this paper fix y u m be as in 2 let s m u denote the

thus sx y sx y sx y s x y py m s x to see that supp sx supp y sx x we apply corollary 2 0 4 and proposition 3 2 1 e noting that supp y sx supp s n 1 bx x since x is closed and reduced the last

x s m u we say that a sequence xk s m u is minimizing if lim sn 1 xk m note that by lemma 4 0 2 m is independent of our choice of u also c implies that 9 m inf an 1 s s f m y u a sequence of film chains sk f m y u is an 1 minimizing if an 1 sk m proposition 6 0 5 there exists a constant a 0 0 such that a n 1 s a 0 for all s f m y u proof let n s 1 be a simple link of m and let t be an tubular neighborhood of n whose closure is disjoint from m let d be the n 1 disk of radius and t d the canonical projection given by t and some trivialization of the normal bundle of n it follows from lemma 4 0 2 that there exists a constant c 0 such that if b t then sn 1 b csn 1 b suppose x is compact and spans m then x t d otherwise the preimage 1 x of a point x d x t would be a simple link of m and

by proposition 6 0 8 b and lemma 2 0 2 so si t ey m s t m y u since t m y u is closed it follows that t y s y t m y u corollary 6 0 11 there exists s 0 t m y u with an 1 s 0 m theorem 6 0 12 if s 0 t

that y s 0 f dv 0 taking positive and negative parts 16 of f and rescaling we can assume without loss of generality that 0 f 1 by continuity there exists 0 and n such that y si f dv for all i n thus by proposition 3 2 1 d 0 y si f dv u fd y si y si x s n 1 xi x for all i n 14 here we think of b 1 n u as a subspace of b 2 n via the canonical injection map u 1 2 n 15 recall h m is the convex hull of m 16 recall b 10 consists of bounded lipschitz functions 28 j harrison h pugh let a h m b h m a and c u a b fix p a and let g rn rn be a diffeomorphism given by the t 1 flow of a vector field v which is everywhere pointing towards p except where it is zero and such that v ba 0 there is some 0 s 1 such that if y c then g y sy 1 s p the magnitude of v is non increasing along flow lines then the lipschitz constant of g is equal to 1 since the divergence of v is everywhere non positive and g u u since u is convex since g is a diffeomorphism it follows from lemma 5 0 7 that x i g xi s m u let s i f m y u be the corresponding sequence of film chains given by theorem 6 0 2 by lemma 4 0 2 we have an 1 s i s n 1 g xi s n 1 g xi a sn 1 g xi b sn 1 g xi c sn 1 xi a sn 1 xi b sn 1 sn 1 xi c sn 1 xi 1 sn 1 sn 1 xi c an 1 si 1 sn 1 sn 1 xi x an 1 si 1 sn 1 thus contradicting the minimality of the sequence si so in particular y s 0 c u so we may define its corresponding measure y s 0 unfortunately this is not the end of the story since s 0 is not a priori an element of f m y u there are two problems to take care of a we don t know that supp s 0 spans m this will be resolved by corollary 2 0 4 upon fixing the next problem b the hausdorff spherical n 1 measure of supp y s 0 may not be equal to m indeed it might not be finite at all and the measure y s 0 may not be s n 1 bx for some x s m u we prove in the next section that this cannot happen 7 minimizing sequences our main goal of this section is to prove theorem 7 0 1 if s 0 t m y u is an 1 minimizing then sn 1 supp s

contained in u and whose centers lie in x let c x m u x m u be the collection of those balls b x m u for which hn 2 bx frb note that lemma 4 0 5 implies that if hn 1 x then almost all 17 balls in x m

p r x 0 m u we will show that if 0 then sn 1 x 0 m theorem 7 2 5 and if 1 then sn 1 x 0 w lim inf sn 1 xk w for all open w u theorem 7 3 10 definition 7 0 3 let k 0 be a strictly decreasing sequence of non zero reals and m u rn a sequence xk k 1 is called uniformly reifenberg k regular if there exists a 0 such that for each k and p r xk m u with r k sn 1 xk p r arn 1 if k 2 k we say xk is reifenberg regular observe that if xk is reifenberg k regular then so too is any subsequence we shall show in proposition 7 2 4 that if xk s m u is reifenberg regular and xk x 0 then there exists a subsequence such that 0 and in proposition 7 3 9 that 1 for a further subsequence overview of the proof of theorem 7 0 1 1 in 7 1 we use our compactness theorem 6 0 10 to find an an 1 minimizing sequence sk s 0 in t m y u where sk f m y u let xk supp y sk k 0 in 7 1 theorem 7 1 7 we cut hairs and create a modified minimizing sequence x k s m u which converges to x 0 in the hausdorff metric we then apply theorem 6 0 2 to create a corresponding sequence s k f m y u of film chains we use the compactness result of corollary 6 0 10 to find a convergent subsequence s ki s 0 t m y u and use proposi tion 3 2 1 to show that s 0 s 0 we may assume without loss of generality then that our original sequence sk s 0 satisfies xk x 0 as in theorem 7 1 7 2 in 7 2 we show that there exists a subsequence ski of sk whose supports xki form a reifenberg regular sequence we may again assume that our original sequence sk has this property too from proposition 7 2 3 we deduce that xk m u 0 which implies that sn 1 x 0 3 in 7 3 we find a subsequence ski whose supports are uniformly concentrated in a disk p r where s n 1 xki p r n 1 rn 1 is close to the infimum of xki m u this is sufficient to prove proposition 7 3 9 if xk is a reifenberg regular minimizing sequence there exists a subsequence xki with xki m u 1 lower semicontinuity of hausdorff spherical measure for reifenberg regular minimizing sequences theorem 7 3 10 follows easily it is also easy to deduce from this that sn 1 x 0 m that s 0 f m y u follows shortly thereafter 7 1 convergence in the hausdorff metric lemmas 7 1 1 7 1 4 are used to modify a spanning set x s m u inside a closed ball p r disjoint from m these are followed by lemma 7 1 5 which modifies x inside a closed cube these lemmas will assist us in our proofs of theorem 7 1 7 and lemma 7 2 1 lemma 7 1 1 is an adaptation of lemma 8 in rei 60 a p 15 30 j harrison h pugh lemma 7 1 1 there exists a constant 1 kn such that if x s m u and p r c x m u then there exists a compact set z rn spanning m satisfying a z p r c x p r c b z p r h x p r c z p r x p r knsn 2 x p r 1 n 2 and d sn 1 z p r knsn 2 x p r n 1 n 2 proof let kn be the constant k n n 1 in lemma 8 of rei 60 a and let z be the set defined as follows let z p r x p r and let z p r be the surface defined in lemma 8 of rei 60 a setting a x p r since z p r is contained in the convex hull of x p r it follows that z p r x p r and so z satisfies a d it remains to show that z spans m in dimension n 3 this is easiest to see in this case there is a grid of cubes and the set x p r is a disjoint union of subsets xi each contained in the interior of one such cube the surface obtained by reifenberg is then the disjoint union of the cones cpi xi for some pi xi to see that z spans in this case suppose it does not then there exists a simple link n s 1 of m disjoint from z we modify the proof of lemma 5 0 9 by projecting radially to the frontier of each cube then radially onto edges and finally orthogonally in a coordinate onto the frontier of p r the new curve is still a simple link of m but is now disjoint from x as well giving a contradiction for n 3 the construction in lemma 8 of rei 60 a is considerably more difficult but the basic idea to showing z spans m is the same using an inductive argument reifenberg chops p r into a number of n cubes q qi ni 1 forming a cover of p r by n cubes with mutually disjoint interiors pairs of opposite faces of each n cube q q are ordered by the coordinate vector to which they are perpendicular and a face in the k th pair lies in the same hyperplane as the corresponding face of any other n cube neighboring q in any of the remaining n k directions for a given face f in the k th pair of faces of an n cube q let n f denote the maximal union containing f of faces neighboring in the above manner 18 let nk n f f is in the k th pair of faces for some cube q likewise let nk f where the union is taken over all k th faces f of the cubes q q now let be as above we first project radially to the frontier of each cube so now s 1 p r ns 1 ns now suppose s 1 p r is contained in ks 1 ns then by projecting s 1 n f p r onto the frontier 19 of n f p r for each n f nk which we may do by induction on n starting at n 4 by the n 3 case of the proof it will follow that s 1 p r is contained in k 1 s 1 ns thus by downward induction on k this will result in a new simple link of m whose intersection with p r lies entirely within fr p r and is thus disjoint from x by 7 1 1 a giving a contradiction the following lemma is an adaptation of lemma 9 in rei 60 a p 18 18 i e f n f and if f n f is in the k th pair of faces of some n cube q then n f also contains the corresponding face of any cube q neighboring q in any of the remaining n k directions so n f f when f is a face in the n th pair of faces of q and n f is the entire hyperplane containing f when f is a face in the 1 st pair 19 considered as a subset of the hyperplane containing n f plateau s problem 31 lemma 7 1 2 suppose x s m u and p r c x m u with sn 2 x p r rn 2 2 kn n 2 there exists a compact set x rn spanning m such that a x p r c x p r c b x p r fr p r and

compact set x spanning m such that x p r c x p r c x p r fr p r and sn 1 x p r sn 1 x p r 2 plateau s problem 33 the remaining part of x q is contained in the region q p r c so we may radially project x q from p to a set y frq and the image x of x under this map spans m by theorem 5 0 6 moreover since the lipschitz constant of the projection is bounded above by 2 n by lemma 4 0 2 and lemma 7 1 4 c

repeating this process for each face f of each q dj such that f is not contained in uj we get a compact set zj spanning m by theorem 5 0 6 furthermore the core z j is contained in uj u since zj u c j

some s 0 in t m y u as in the beginning of the proof by taking a further subsequence we can also ensure that y s ji y s 0 in c u we show y s 0 y s 0 and hence s 0 s 0 by proposition 6 0 8 b let x 0

reifenberg regular minimizing sequence with xk x 0 for each 0 there exists p r x 0 m u such that xk is uniform with respect to p r proof the proof is straightforward and uses lemma 7 3 4 details can be found as 33 and 35 on pp 35 36 of rei 60 a where p p 1 and r r 2 the following lemma is an adaptation of lemma 6 of rei 60 a p 32 it is a version of what is sometimes called the weak geometric lemma but only holds for p r x 0 m u for which xk is uniform lemma 7 3 7 weak geometric lemma suppose xk s m u is reifenberg regular mini mizing and xk x 0 if 0 there exist 0 0 and v 0 such that if xk is 0 uniform with respect to p r then for each p r p r with p x 0 there exists a point p x 0 and a hyperplane through p such that p vr p r and x 0 p vr vr proof the proof is identical to that of lemma 6 of rei 60 a which follows from lemma 5 with the exception that equation 6 on p 30 of rei 60 a follows from lemmas 4 0 5 7 3 1 and 5 0 9 the reader interested in details can find them in rei 60 a there are several ambiguities in his proof of lemma 5 however so we provide the reader with some helpful notes first the sets n and c consist of those points whose joins to p make an an angle not greater than with the line passing through the points p and q not just the line segment pq second the point p 0 should be on the opposite side of p from q not between the two as stated third equation 6 is valid only for n large enough fourth the square roots in equation 6 arise from the law of cosines applied three different times and the inequality follows from applying lemma 7 3 1 using center point p 0 the next result is based on lemma 12 of rei 60 a p 22 we shall only apply this to p r for which xk is uniform and minimizing lemma 7 3 8 squashing let x s m u and q r x m u if is a hyperplane containing q and x q r r for some 1 2 then either sn 1 x q r n 1 rn 1 22 n 1 n 1 n 2 r sn 2 x q r or there exists a compact set x spanning m equal to x outside q r such that sn 1 x q r 22 n 1 n 1 n 2 r sn 2 x q r plateau s problem 41 proof let c be the radial projection from q onto fr q r of x x q r ix where ix denotes the line segment joining x to its orthogonal projection on by lemma 4 0 2 and lemma 4 0 7 sn 1 c 22 n 1 n 1 n 2 r sn 2 x q r there are two possibilities either y x x q r c spans m or it does not see figure 5 suppose y does not span m we show the orthogonal projection of c x q r onto contains x p r p c x p r x p r c p e p r x p r e p r figure 5 two cases for lemma 7 3 8 q r and thus by lemma 4 0 1 the first conclusion of the lemma will be satisfied let n s 1 be a simple link of m disjoint from y let us assume without loss of generality that the intersection n fr q r is transverse the intersection n q r consists of a finite collection of arcs i whose endpoints p 1 i p 2 i lie on fr q r since c fr q r we may replace each arc i with a pair of line segments p 1 i q followed by qp 2 i so now the curve will only be piecewise smooth however the intersection n q r is now disjoint from x x q r ix as well the hyperplane divides q r into two hemispheres north with pole n and south with pole s pick an endpoint p j i j 1 2 lying in some hemisphere with pole p observe that for any x in the geodesic arc between p j i and p the line segment between x and q will be disjoint from x x q r ix this gives a regular homotopy of n and so we may assume without loss of generality that each p j i n s now suppose the orthogonal projection of c x q r onto does not contain q r let a q r be such a point and let an as be the points in the northern and southern hemispheres of fr p r respectively whose orthogonal projection onto is a by sliding the p j i along the geodesic arcs from n to an and s to as we can as above assume each p j i an as now replace the pair of segments p 1 i q qp 2 i with the single segment p 1 i p 2 i it may be degenerate smoothing the resulting curve this gives a simple link n of m disjoint from x a contradiction 42 j harrison h pugh finally if y does span m then the set x y satisfies the second conclusion of the lemma then next result relies on the concept of uniform concentration which was introduced although not formally defined in rei 60 a pp 35 36 39 41 and later rediscovered in dm 92 proposition 7 3 9 suppose xk s m u is reifenberg regular minimizing with xk x 0 then 1 proof let 0 obtain 0 and v from lemma 7 3 7 by lemma 7 3 6 for each 0 0 there exists p r x 0 m u such that xk is uniform with respect to p r according to lemma 7 3 7 for each p r p r with p x 0 there exists p x 0 and a hyperplane through p such that p vr p r and x 0 p vr p vr next apply lemma 7 3 8 to each p vr x m u and its hyperplane we can rule out part b since xk is minimizing since contains p and x p vr p vr then part a implies sn 1 x p vr n 1 vr n 1 22 n 1 n 1 n 2 vr sn 2 x p vr 22 since xni is uniform with respect to x 0 p r it follows that sn 1 xni p vr 2 n 1 vr 2 n 1 2 23 and fni p vr 2 n 1 vr n 1 24 for sufficiently large i then we can find i with vr 2 i vr such that sn 2 xni p i 2 2 n 1 vr n 2 25 then 22 and 25 imply sn 1 xk p i n 1 n 1 i 2 2 n 1 n 1 n 2 2 vrsn 2 x p i n 1 n 1 i 2 2 n 1 2 2 n 1 n 2 2 vr n 1 thus sn 1 xk p vr n 1 vr n 1 1 22 n 1 2 n 1 n 2 2 this establishes what some call uniform concentration for xk with respect to p r it follows that sn 1 xk p vr n 1 vr n 1 by definition 7 3 5 hence 1 22 n 1 2 n 1 n 2 2 plateau s problem 43 since this holds for all and the result follows theorem 7 3 10 suppose xk s m u is reifenberg regular minimizing and xk x 0 u if w rn is open then sn 1 x 0 w lim inf sn 1 xk w proof let 0 since sn 1 m 0 it follows from theorem 7 2 5 and lemma 4 0 1 that we may cover sn 1 almost all of x 0 w by a collection pi ri x 0 m u of disjoint balls of diameter 2 ri and contained in w thus by proposition 7 3 9 s n 1 x 0 w s n 1 x 0 w i pi ri i n 1 r n 1 i i lim inf k sn 1 xk pi ri lim inf k i sn 1 xk pi ri lim inf k sn 1 xk w proof of theorem 7 0 1 let s 0 t m y u be an 1 minimizing by proposition 7 2 3 and the orem 6 0 12 we may apply theorem 7 3 10 we set w rn and this yields by 9 p 26 sn 1 supp y s 0 m in particular supp y s 0 will have empty interior and hence by corollary 2 0 4 supp y s 0 supp s 0 on the other hand by theorem 6 0 12 and proposition 6 0 8 d supp s 0 s m u and hence sn 1 supp s 0 m we next prove that s 0 f m y u pick a sequence sk as in proposition 7 2 3 and a dyadic subdivision s of rn such that each q s is y sk compatible 21 and xk supp sk compatible for all k 0 theorem 7 3 10 implies sn 1 x 0 q lim inf sn 1 xk q for all q s this is in fact an equality for if sn 1 x 0 q lim inf sn 1 xk q for some q s then by theorem 7 3 10 applied to w x 0 qc m sn 1 x 0 s n 1 x 0 q sn 1 x 0 qc sn 1 x 0 q lim inf sn 1 xk qc lim inf sn 1 xk q lim inf sn 1 xk qc lim inf sn 1 xk m so by proposition 3 2 2 sn 1 bx 0 q lim inf y sk q y s 0 q using a whitney decompo sition this equality extends to all open sets w and hence by outer regularity of the finite borel 21 see definition 3 2 3 this is possible by proposition 6 0 8 44 j harrison h pugh measure y s 0 26 sn 1 bx 0 y s 0 it follows from corollary 2 0 4 and proposition 3 2 1 e that x 0 is reduced thus x 0 s m u and so by proposition 6 0 8 b c and theorem 6 0 12 s 0 f m y u 8 regularity let s m us m u where the union ranges over all convex open sets u containing m likewise let f m u y f m y u where the union ranges over all convex open sets u containing m and all vector fields y as in 2 the following result follows from corollary 6 0 11 and theorem 7 0 1 theorem 8 0 1 there exists an element s 0 f m such that an 1 s 0 sn 1 supp s 0 m thus we have proved the bulk of our main theorem there exists a size minimizing element of f m we now prove some regularity results for such size minimizing elements corollary 8 0 2 if s 0 f m is a size minimizer and p r is disjoint from m then supp s 0 p r is 1 restricted 22 with respect to p r c for all 0 proof let x 0 supp s 0 suppose x 0 is a competitor 23 of x 0 with respect to m by theorem 5 0 6 and lemma 5 0 7 x 0 s m and so putting this together we have sn 1 x 0 sn 1 x 0 this gives the result since every permissible deformation in the definition of restricted sets is of this type it follows from corollary 8 0 2 and alm 68 1 7 that the support of any size minimizer s 0 f m which we know exists by theorem 8 0 1 is almost everywhere a real analytic n 1 dimensional minimal submanifold of rn soap film regularity for n 3 follows from tay 76 and this completes the proof of our main theorem 24 22 see alm 76 and although we replace hn 1 measure with sn 1 in almgren s definition of 1 restricted experts assure us that these regularity theorems hold for hausdorff spherical measure as well as for hausdorff measure but just to be safe we know that x 0 is n 1 rectifiable since it is quasiminimal ds 00 in which case the two measures are the same if is lipschitz the set x 0 is also n 1 rectifiable and so sn 1 h x 0 sn 1 x 0 23 see definition 5 0 5 24 as a corollary we can deduce that the solutions for jordan curves in r 3 found in har 14 b are the same as the solutions in this paper and thus have the structure of a soap film suppose a 0 is a solution found as a limit of dipole surfaces in r 3 since dipole surfaces which span m are also film chains then a 0 is a solution in f m conversely if s 0 is a solution in f m then it can be written as a series of embedded dipole surfaces from taylor i 1 pvi i where vi is a vector field whose component orthogonal to is unit let b be the differential 2 chain whose support is the boundary of the tubular neighborhood of m let x be the unit vector field transverse to b for sufficiently large n i 1 pvi i px b is a dipole surface which spans m its limit is s 0 this proves that s 0 obtained from theorem 8 0 1 is a solution in har 14 b plateau s problem 45 references all 72 william k allard on the first variation of a varifold annals of mathematics 95 1972 no 3 417 491 alm 65
