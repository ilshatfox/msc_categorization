limits of point measures arising from substitutions we consider a general primitive substitution on a finite polygon set in r 2 and show that limits of certain atomic measures each converge to lebesgue measure 1 introduction associating point measures to iterated substitutions goes back to kakutani 7 who con sidered division of the unit interval into two subintervals 0 and 1 if one repeats this division with the same ratio for each interval created and places a point mass at each division point the limit of these measures converges weak to a measure which is mutually singular with lebesgue measure unless 1 2 in which case it equals lebesgue measure in 10 olli generalized this to a family of substitutions in r 2 namely conway s pin wheel substitution and sadun s generalization of it see 13 conway s original pinwheel substitution is a scheme for dividing a 1 2 5 triangle into five uniformly scaled copies of the original and sadun s generalization provides a way to substitute any right triangle into five triangles which are similar to the original but not uniformly scaled since the trian gles created by these divisions are similar to the original the substitution can be repeated thereby dividing the original triangle into smaller and smaller triangles at each step k in this process olli defines three measures k k and k on the original triangle r based on the substitution these generate three sequencees of measures that are related to the distribution of vertices and triangles the measure k places a point mass at the barycenter of each triangle created at step k while k and k place a point masses at the vertices of the triangles the measure k simply puts the same weight at each vertex while k weights each vertex for each triangle which has a vertex which intersects it each measure is then normalized so as to be a probability measure olli then proves 10 theorem 1 partially supported by cnpq brasil supported by cnpq brasil 1 http arxiv org abs 1304 6435 v 3 that each of these measures converges to the same measure in the weak topology and that this limiting measure is equal to normalized lebesgue measure if and only if the original triangle was a 1 2 5 triangle that is when the similar triangles at each step were uniformly scaled copies of r we extend this result of olli to other substitutions with uniform scaling that is we consider a finite set p of polygons in r 2 and a substitution rule on p which divides elements of p into copies of elements of p scaled down by a constant factor of 0 we assume that is primitive in the sense that there is a k such that for any p q p if we divide p k times then it will contain a copy of q this situation is quite common in the theory of substitution tilings such as the penrose tiling see 1 and 14 for example we assume that the elements of p are disjoint and let x be the union of its elements so that x is a disjoint union of a finite number of polygons embedded in r 2 we assume that the elements of p are uniformly scaled so that the lebesgue measure of x is 1 the substitution can then be repeatedly applied to the space x dividing each polygon into smaller ones and we can define probability measures analogous to those defined in 10 again k will place a point mass at a consistently chosen internal point of each polygon created at stage k while k and k will place point masses at the vertices of the polygons the measure k puts a single point mass at each vertex while k again places weights on the vertices based on how many polygons intersect it see definitions 3 1 3 2 and 3 3 for the precise statements and see example 3 4 for a clear picture of the weights that these measures give we note that we change the name of olli s k to k because the letter is usually reserved for the substitution rule in the literature concerning substitution tilings we prove the following theorem 1 1 each of the sequences k k and k converges weak to lebesgue measure this is consistent with 10 as the only case there with a constant scaling factor is in the case of the original pinwheel tiling and there the measures converge to lebesgue measure this note is organized as follows in section 2 we present the background material needed to define our measures as well as recall the perron frobenius theorem since primi tive substitutions in r 2 arise most often in the study of aperiodic tilings we use terminology common to that setting for instance we will call the polygons created at each stage tiles in section 3 we define our measures and prove that k and k converge to lebesgue measure using only the perron frobenius theorem and general measure theory results in section 4 we use the fact that x is a continuous surjective image of the path space of a simple bratteli diagram arising from the substitution to show that k also converges to lebesgue measure 2 remark 1 2 we are grateful to ian putnam for pointing out to us that the techniques used in 9 can be adapted to prove our result as is shown in 1 a primitive substitution gives rise to a mixing topological dynamical system which is an example of a smale space in this context has a measure of maximum entropy for called the bowen measure which is a product of measures on the stable and unstable sets in this smale space the unstable sets are copies of r 2 and in decomposing bowen measure the factor on the unstable sets is lesbesgue measure in 9 they prove that is a weak limit of a sequence of measures kb c k n constructed from a set b in an unstable set of and a set c in a stable set each kb c is a sum of point masses depending on choice of b and c if we choose b to be any bounded open set in our x and c to be the set where point masses are present in our measures on x then the sequences kb c k n eventually count up the same point masses as our sequences k k and k different choices of c result in the different sequences of measures our result that the sequences k k and k all converge to lebesgue measure can be deduced from 9 theorem 2 5 we are also grateful to the referee for indicating that our results as well as an analogous result for higher dimensions also follow from results of kellendonk and savinien concerning spectral triples arising from stationary bratteli diagrams see 8 sections 4 4 and 4 5 spectral triples are an important and subtle concept in noncommutative geometry see connes book 3 for a reference on spectral triples in particular and on noncommutative geometry in general regardless of the above our result is of independent interest as it can be stated in basic measure theoretic terms and can be proven with elementary techniques notwithstanding the use of bratteli diagrams in section 4 avoiding the use of the heavy machinery of smale spaces and noncommutative geometry 2 substitutions in r 2 a tile is a polygon in r 2 possibly carrying a label a patch is a finite set of tiles whose interiors are pairwise disjoint if p is a patch the support of p denoted supp p is the union of its tiles if u r 2 and p is a patch then we let p u denote the set of tiles in p which intersect u we are concerned with substitutions on tiles let p p 1 p 2 pn be a finite set of polygons in r 2 and without loss of generality assume that they are disjoint so that strictly speaking p is itself a patch in keeping with the literature on substitution tilings we will call p the set of prototiles for each p p pick a distinguished point x p in its interior and call this the puncture of p if t is a tile and t h p for some p p and isometry h of the plane we will say that p is a copy of p and that x t h x p is the puncture of t we will assume that perhaps after labeling none of the prototiles are 3 copies of each other denote by p the set of patches whose elements are copies of elements of p a substitution on p is a map p p such that there exists 1 such that supp p p for all p p clearly can be extended to a map p p in the obvious way and so can be iterated we say that is primitive if there exists m n such that m p contains a copy of q for any p q p fix once and for all a set p of prototiles and a primitive substitution let a be the n n matrix whose i j entry is the number of copies of prototile pi in pj primitivity of implies primitivity of a that is there exists m n such that the entries of am are all strictly positive the following are well known facts from the perron frobenius theorem on primitive matrices see 2 theorem 3 3 1 and proposition 3 6 3 for example 1 the matrix a has a unique largest eigenvalue 0 which has multiplicity 1 2 there is a unique left eigenvector vl of a for with positive entries such that vl i 1 we assume that all vectors are columns and so write v t la v t l 3 there is a right eigenvector vr of a for with strictly positive entries and v t lvr 1 4 the matrix vrv t l is the projection onto span vr and we have that lim k kak vrv t l in particular if x rn then lim k kakx vrv t lx when the matrix a arises from a substitution in r 2 we also have the following 5 assuming that the elements of p have been uniformly scaled so that the sum of their lebesgue measures is 1 the ith entry of vl vl i is m pi the lebesgue measure of pi in addition 2 see 14 corollary 2 4 example 2 1 below is the penrose substitution a b a c b d c d d c b cd a here the scaling constant is the golden ratio 1 5 2 and the ratios of the three side lengths on the tiles on the left are 1 and 2 we note that the copies on the right hand side are images of the original prototiles under orientation preserving isometries it is possible to present this substitution with just two prototiles but since the tiles have 4 reflectional symmetries one would need to explicitly state the isometry for each tile on the right in our case the substitution matrix is a 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 the entries of a 2 are all strictly positive so is primitive one calculates that the largest eigenvalue of a is 2 with left and right eigenvectors vl 1 2 2 1 1 and vr 2 2 1 1 1 t after normalizing one sees that the entries of vl do indeed add up to 1 and the ratios of its entries are exactly the relative areas of the prototiles for more examples of substitutions in r 2 we refer to 1 4 and 5 for more on the general theory of substitutions we refer to queffe lec 12 3 point measures in 10 olli considers sequences of measures on a single right triangle which is then divided according to a generalized pinwheel scheme she then shows that each of these sequences converges to the same measure because we have more than one tile type we will instead define analogous measures on the union of the prototiles since we assumed that the prototiles are disjoint the union of the prototiles embeds into r 2 nicely let x p p p be the disjoint union of the prototiles all measures we consider are defined on the algebra of the borel sets in x and so we make no further explicit reference to it as in the previous section we assume that elements of p are uniformly scaled so that the lebesgue measure m of x is equal to 1 hence m pi vl i let tk k k p k k p p p also let t k 0 tk then each tk is a patch which is the union of the patches k k pi consisting of copies of elements of kp each of the patches tk has support x from the definition of the 5 matrix a we have that the jth entry of the vector akei is the number of copies of kpj in the patch k k pi in particular if we define 1 1 1 1 t to be the column vector in rn with 1 in every entry and let ei be the ith standard basis vector in rn then the total number of tiles in k k pi is 1 takei and the total number of tiles in tk is 1 tak 1 an element t tk is a scaled copy of an element of p and so we can speak of its puncture without confusion denote the puncture of t by x t as above definition 3 1 for each k n define a measure k on x by k 1 tk t tk x t where x indicates the point mass at the point x x for a tile t we let v t denote the set of vertices of t we also write v p for the set of vertices in the patch p definition 3 2 for each k n define a measure k on x by k 1 t tk v t t tk x v t x for a borel set e and for each tile in tk which intersects e k counts one for each vertex in the tile contained in e and then normalizes hopefully without confusion we let v indicate the column vector in rn whose ith entry is the number of vertices in the tile pi then we see that since the jth entry of the vector ak 1 is the number of copies of kpj in tk we must have that t tk v t vtak 1 definition 3 3 for each k n define a measure k on x by k 1 v tk x v tk x the space x can be seen as the disjoint union of all the prototiles each measure substitutes each prototile k times without scaling and assigns point masses to points inside each prototile and then normalizes the measure k the distribution of prototiles after k division steps puts a point mass at the puncture of each tile the measure k the distribution of vertices after k division steps puts a point mass at each vertex in the patch while k the distribution of vertices counted with multiplicity after k division steps puts a point mass at each vertex weighted by how many tiles intersect it 6 example 3 4 in the case of the penrose tiling from example 2 1 the space x is the set of triangles on the left hand side we will show what the measures 2 2 and 2 look like on supp b x to calculate 2 we first find 1 ta 21 26 then there is a point mass with weight 1 26 at each puncture in the image above the measures 2 and 2 put weights at the vertices of the tiles since each tile has three vertices we have that vta 21 3 26 78 furthermore after substituting twice the tiles a and b each have 6 vertices and tiles c and d have 9 vertices and so v t 2 30 thus 2 and 2 put weights on the vertices according to the following image 2 78 2 78 1 78 3 78 3 78 4 78 2 1 30 1 30 1 30 1 30 1 30 1 30 2 for the rest of this section we prove theorem 1 1 for k and k our proof relies only on the perron frobenius theorem and general measure theory results we prove theorem 1 1 for k using the theory of bratteli diagrams see section 4 lemma 3 5 11 theorem 3 1 4 if a sequence of borel measures k converges to weak and if e is a borel set such that e 0 then we have that k e e lemma 3 6 let k be a sequence of measures onx such that for any t t the sequence of numbers k t converges to m t let l be an edge of some tile in tk then l has measure zero with respect to any weak limit point of k proof let be a cluster point of k let 0 and find 0 such that m b l find l 0 such that is greater than the diameter of any element of lp then supp tl l b l 7 let f be a continuous function with 0 f x 1 for all x x such that f x 1 for all x l and also such that f is supported on supp tl l such a function exists by urysohn s lemma then we have l l d f d lim k f d k lim k supp tl l d k lim k k supp tl l lim k t tl l k t t tl l m t remark 3 7 the above lemma is the analogous of theorem 2 in 10 though the state ment in 10 about k is correct we do not see why the proof is proposition 3 8 let k be a sequence of measures on x such that for any t t the sequence of numbers k t converges to m t then k converges weak to m proof first we note that t is a countable set and for any open set u x and x u we can find t t such that x t u so t generates the borel algebra on x let be a cluster point of k by lemma 3 6 t 0 for all t t and hence by lemma 3 5 t m t for all t t and so m now since the closed unit ball is compact in the weak topology and k has only one cluster point lebesgue measure we conclude that k converges to m weak as we see below proposition 3 8 is a powerful tool to establish the convergence of k and k lemma 3 9 if t t then the sequence k t converges to m t proof let t tj for k j k t counts the number of tiles in the patch k j k j t and divides it by the number of tiles among all tk we show that this ratio converges to the lebesgue measure of t as k we know that t is a copy of some element of jp say jps for k j the number of tiles in the patch k j k j t tk is equal to 1 tak jes hence we have k t k j k j t tk 1 tak jes 1 tak 1 1 tak jes 1 tajak j 1 1 1 tvrv t les 1 tajvrv t l 1 1 tvr vl s 1 t 2 jvr vl s 2 j since vl s is the lebesgue measure of ps for any s this is equal to the lebesgue measure of ps divided by 2 j which is the lebesgue measure of t a copy of jps 8 corollary 3 10 the sequence k converges to m weak we now turn to k lemma 3 11 let l be an edge in some tile in t then the sequence of numbers k l converges to 0 proof we first observe that if l is the edge of some tile t tj then the substitution divides l into some number of subedges for k j we denote this set of subedges as k j l if d is the minimum edge length among all prototiles then the number of elements of k j l is bounded by k l d where l denotes the length of l next we know that k assigns one point mass to l for each tile vertex which intersects l and then divides by the total number of vertices with multiplicity of tiles in tk because there are only a finite number of prototiles it is possible to find c 0 such that the number of such point masses is bounded by c k j l together with the previous paragraph this implies that k l 1 vtak 1 c k l d c l d k 2 kvtvrv t l 1 0 lemma 3 12 if t t then the sequence k t converges to m t proof suppose that t tj that t is a copy of jps p and k j then before normalizing k t counts v t for each t tk contained in t plus some contributions from tiles not contained in t whose vertices intersect t since all these additional contributions must intersect the boundary of t they must be dominated by k t which by lemma 3 11 converges to zero hence we must have that lim k k t lim k 1 vtak 1 t t t tk v t lim k vtak jes vtak 1 vtvrv t les vtajvrv t l 1 vtvr vl s vt 2 jvr vl s 2 j which as before is equal to m t corollary 3 13 the sequence k converges to m weak 9 4 convergence of k to prove that k converges to m we use the theory of bratteli diagrams for the reader s convenience we recall some of the key definitions below a bratteli diagram is an infinite directed graph b v e r s where v denotes the vertex set e the edge set and r s are the range and source maps from e to v furthermore the vertex set v is partitioned into disjoint finite sets vn n n called levels such that for each edge e e s e vn implies that r e vn 1 and also such that r 1 v and s 1 v are finite and nonempty for each v v v 0 the path space of b is the set xb xi i n xi e r xi s xi 1 for all i n if en is the set of edges with s e vn then we can view xb as a subspace of the space en with each of the en given the discrete topology given a sequence x 1 x 2 xn with x 1 e 1 and r xi s xi 1 for all i let c x 1 x 2 xn yi i n yi xi for 1 i n sets of the above form are called cylinder sets they are both open and closed in xb and generate the topology on xb let rb x y xb xb there exists i n such that xk yk for all k i then rb is an equivalence relation on xb if x y rb then x and y are said to be tail equivalent a borel measure on xb is said to be rb invariant if whenever c x 1 x 2 xn and c x 1 x 2 x n are cylinder sets with r xn r x n then c x 1 x 2 xn c x 1 x 2 x n suppose that b v e r s is a bratteli diagram and there exists n n such that vn n for all n write each of the vn as vn v n 1 v n 2 v n n and write e v w for the set of edges between vertices v and w suppose that the cardinality of the set e v n j v n 1 i depends only on i and j if this is all satisfied we say that b is stationary the edges drawn between levels look the same at every level in this case let ab be the n n matrix whose i j entry is the cardinality of the set e v n j v n 1 i ab is called the incidence matrix of the stationary diagram 10 it is known see for example 6 that if ab is a primitive matrix then there exists only one rb invariant probability measure ab on xb if is the perron frobenius eigenvalue of ab and vl is the left perron frobenius eigenvector of ab normalized so its entries sum to 1 then ab c x 1 xn nvl r xn 2 where it is understood that vl can be seen as a function on the vertices now let us return to our chosen primitive substitution on p as before construct from this data a stationary bratteli diagram b where at each level the vertex set is a copy of the prototile set and there is an edge from pj to pi for each copy of pi in pj each edge e with s e pj and r e pi labels a way that a copy of 1 pi sits inside pj the incidence matrix of this diagram ab is then therefore the same primitive matrix a from the previous sections each edge in b from pj to pi corresponds to a specific copy of pi in pj because of this as in 10 we can associate to each tile t in tk a finite path x 1 xk in b the edge xi corresponds to the scaled copy of r xi in s xi which contains t similarly each point x in x is labeled by an infinite sequence of edges xi i n and if x lies on the edge of some tile then it is associated to a finite number of sequences define xb x by saying xi i n is the point given by the labeling xi i n this map is continuous and finite to one furthermore if t is a tile in tk then 1 t is the cylinder set given the labeling mentioned above recall that the measure a defines a measure a on x by the formula a e a 1 e for any borel set e x lemma 4 1 the measure a is equal to m proof first if l is an edge of some tile from step j and k j we have that 1 l is contained in 1 supp k t l which is itself contained in the union of cylinders in xb which correspond to tiles in k t l as in the proof of lemma 3 11 we can find c 0 such that the number of such cylinders is bounded by c l k d if m is the maximum entry of the vector vl then by equation 2 we have a l m 2 kc l k d this is true for all k 0 so a l 0 now suppose t is a tile then 1 t is the disjoint union of the cylinder which corre sponds to t and a subset of 1 t the measure of the latter is zero and so a agrees with m on elements of t so as before they must be equal we can now prove convergence of k proposition 4 2 the sequence k converges to m weak 11 proof let be a cluster point for k say lim ni as before our first step is to show that the measure of an edge is zero for this notice that the measures k and m can be seen as elements of the dual of c x also as in 10 for all k and all f c x k f is between two constant multiples of k f and so since k converges to lebesgue measure we have that f is between two constant multiples of m f for all f c x now since the continuous functions are dense in l 1 m this last statement implies that m and hence the measure of an edge is zero by lemma 3 5 ni t converges to t for all t t also we know that if t and t are two tiles of the same type created at the same level s then for k s we have k t k t thus t t now suppose that is a pullback of that is exists because the set on which fails to be one to one has measure zero then the above paragraph implies that whenever c and c are cylinder sets which end at the same vertex then we must have that c c that is is rb invariant this is because cylinders ending at the same vertex correspond to tiles of the same type created at the same level since a is the only rb invariant measure we obtain that a and hence a and m as desired proof of theorem 1 1 this combines corollary 3 10 corollary 3 13 and proposition 4 2 references 1 jared e anderson and ian f putnam topological
