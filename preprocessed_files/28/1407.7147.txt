understanding stochastic differential equations pat muldowney abstract this essay explores the meaning of stochastic differential equations and stochastic integrals it sets these subjects in a context of riemann stieltjes integration it is intended as a comment or supplement to 2 ito s formula is an example of a stochastic differential equation dys f xs s ds 1 2 2 f xs x 2 s ds f xs xs dxs 1 for ys f xs this formula is an evocative shorthand way of writing yt y 0 t dys t f xs s ds 1 2 t 2 f xs x 2 s ds t f xs xs dxs 2 if the various expressions in this equation represented ordinary numbers and functions then the presence in the equation of various integration processes might incline us to call 2 an integral equation but while the symbol f in both equations is actually an ordinary deter ministic function such as the operation of taking the square of some operand the symbols x and y do not represent ordinary functions or definite numbers instead they are random variables that is quantities which are indefinite or unknown to the extent that they can be predicted only within some margin of error the presence of in the equation indicates that it is an exact statement about actual quantities ito s formula can be best regarded as an exact state ment about margins of error in uncertain quantities in other words it deals with probability distributions of unpredictable quan tities which are obtained by means of various operations in the formula such as the integration operation so ito s formula can be regarded as a kind of integral equation in which the integrals are the type known as stochastic integrals what is a stochastic integral what is the meaning of ito s formula these questions are not trivial they can be answered in a loose or intuitive manner but deeper and more exact understanding can be challenging for non specialists and since they are a fundamental part of many important practical subjects such as finance and communications an understanding of them which is merely loose or hazy can be a serious barrier to competent practice in such subjects the purpose of this essay is to outline an introduction to stochastic integrals which is less difficult than the standard textbook treatment of this subject it 1 ar x iv 1 40 7 71 47 v 4 m at h p r 1 6 s ep 2 01 4 uses henstock s non absolute integration instead of lebesgue integration the essay explores compares and contrasts these two methods of integration with a view to assessing their role in stochastic integrals 1 random variables broadly speaking at the risk of haziness and looseness a random variable is a mathematical representation of a measurement an experiment trial or ob servation of some uncertain or unpredictable occurrence or value for instance the random variable z could represent a single throw of a die so z represents possible outcomes z 1 z 6 with probabilities 1 6 1 6 or it could represent measurement of a standard normal variable whose possible values are the real numbers z r with standard normal probability distribution n 0 1 suppose the throw of the die yields a payoff or outcome y f z obtained by the following deterministic calculation y 1 if z 1 1 if z 6 0 otherwise this particular experiment or game depends on is contingent on the outcome of the experiment z and can be denoted by y f z where z has six possible outcomes with a uniform probability distribution y has three possible outcomes whose probability distribution can easily be deduced by means of the deterministic calculation f the probability distribution 1 of y is y 1 with probability 1 6 y 1 with probability 1 6 and y 0 with probability 2 3 we can easily invent such contingent random variables or gambling games using more than one throw of the die and with payoff y dependent on some calculation based on the joint outcome of the successive throws this intuitive formulation is compatible with the formal and rigorous con ception of a random variable as a p measurable function whose domain is a p measurable sample space this twentieth century injection of mathemati cal rigor brought about a great extension of the depth and scope of the theory of probability and random variation including the development of many new spheres of application of the theory these applications often involve stochastic processes suppose t is some set of indexing elements s for instance t could be an interval of real numbers a b a stochastic process y yt is a family y y s s t for which each element y s ys is a random variable a sample path y s s t of 1 the probability distribution margin of error carries the essential information speci fying the character of the random variable or experiment it is often convenient to include other potential values or outcomes which are not actually possible or potential for in stance in the die throwing experiment we can declare that every real number is a potential outcome in that case we assign probability zero to the impossible outcomes this does not change the random variable or its probability distribution in any essential way that affects its mathematical meaning 2 the process y yt can be thought of as a function y t 7 r in which for each s y s or ys is a possible outcome of the random variable measurement experiment trial y s 2 stochastic integrals take t 0 t equation 2 above appears to be the result of applying an integration operation t to the equation 1 if this is the case and if this step is justified then comparison of 1 and 2 implies without delving into their actual meaning that t dys t 0 dys yt y 0 or t dy s t 0 dy s y t y 0 3 on the face of it a clear and precise understanding of this simplest of all possible stochastic integrals would seem to be the sine qua non of this subject expressed as a stochastic differential equation it is the tautology dys dys whatever 3 actually means it seems consistent enough with more familiar forms of integration of the stieltjes kind in the somewhat loose and uncritical sense that the integral or sum of increments dy gives an overall increment advancing a little bit further take a deterministic function f and consider t f ys dys or t f y s dy s which is a more general version of t dys if y is a sample path of the process y the expression t f y s dy s or t f ys dys 4 is a stieltjes type integral which if it exists may be thought of as some limit of riemann sums f y s y s or f y sj y tj y tj 1 where the finite set of points tj form a partition of the interval t 0 t with tj 1 sj tj for each j from the point of view of basic mathematical analysis unlike 3 which is about margins of error in probabilistic measurement there is nothing prob lematic about 4 this riemann stieltjes type integral may or may not exist for particular functions y and f but it is a fairly familiar subject for anyone who has studied basic riemann type integration in the riemann sums for 4 some applications require that sj tj 1 for each j cauchy s approach to the theory of integration used approximating sums with sj tj 1 or sj tj so such sums can be called cauchy sums rather than riemann sums in any event there are various ways including the lebesgue method in which we can seek to define an integral t f y s dy s for sample paths yt y s s t of a stochastic process y yt suppose a stieltjes type integral of f y s is calculated with respect to the increments y i y tj y tj 1 of the function yt for instance if f is a function taking some fixed real constant value such as 1 then a naive riemann sum calculation on the domain t 0 t with t 0 0 and tn 1 gives 3 f y s y i n j 1 y i y t 1 y 0 y t 2 y t 1 y 1 y tn 1 y 1 y 0 for every sample outcome yt of the process yt so it is reasonable in some naive way to claim that for this particular function f the riemann stieltjes integral exists for all outcomes yt t f ys dys t 0 dy s y t y 0 one might then be tempted 2 to apply such an argument to step functions f and perhaps to try to extend it to some class of continuous functions f especially if we are only concerned with sample paths yt which are continuous but the key point here is that given a stochastic process y yt and given certain deterministic functions f real values t f y s dy s can be obtained for each sample path y yt by means of a recognizable stieltjes integration procedure can this class of real numbers or outcomes be related somehow to some identifiable random variable z which possesses some identifiable probability distribution or margin of error estimates if so then z might reasonably be considered to be the random variable obtained by integrating in some stieltjes fashion the random variable f ys with respect to the increments y i y tj y tj 1 of the stochastic process yt in other words z is the stochastic integral t f ys dys to justify the latter step a probability distribution or margin of error data for z must be determined but in the case of the constant function f given above f ys 1 this is straightforward because with f ys 1 for all outcomes ys in all sample paths or joint outcomes yt the distribution function obtained for the riemann sum values f ys y i is simply the known distribution function of the outcomes y t y 0 of the random variable y t y 0 this distribution is the same for all partitions of t 0 t so it is rea sonable to take it to be the distribution function of the stochastic integral z t f ys dys for constant f this seems to provide meaning and ratio nale for 4 what this amounts to is a naive or intuitive interpretation of stochastic integration which seems to hold for some elementary functions f this ap proach can be pursued further to give a straightforward interpretation indeed a proof of ito s formula at least for the unchallenging functions f mentioned above but what of the standard or rigorous theory of stochastic integration 2 a warning about this temptation is provided in example 1 below 4 3 standard theory of stochastic integration unfortunately this theory cannot accommodate the naive or intuitive con struction of the simple stochastic integrals described in the preceding section broadly speaking the elementary riemann sum type of calculation is not ad equate for the kinds of analysis needed in this subject it is not possible for instance to apply a monotone convergence theorem or a dominated convergence theorem to simple riemann and riemann stieltjes integrals historically these kinds of analysis and proof have been supplied by lebesgue type integrals which while requiring a measure function as integrator cannot be simply defined by means of the usual arrangement 3 of riemann sums and this is where the difficulty is located suppose for instance that the stochastic process yt that we are dealing with is a standard brownian motion in that case any sample path yt is on the one hand almost surely continuous which is nice but on the other hand it is almost surely not of bounded variation in every interval j of the domain t 0 1 and the latter is nasty this turns out to be very troublesome if we wish to construct a lebesgue stieltjes integral using the increments y i y tj y tj 1 of a sample path which is continuous but not of bounded variation in any interval the problem is that in order to construct a lebesgue stieltjes measure from the increments y i we must separate the non negative increments y i from the negative valued increments y i y i y i y i and try to construct a non negative measure from each of the components but because y is not of bounded variation the construction for each component diverges to infinity on every interval j thus the standard theory of stochastic integration encounters a significant difficulty at the very first step 4 to summarize in the standard ito or lebesgue integral approach the most basic calcu lation of the integral of a constant function f yt with respect to the increments dy of a brownian process fails because the lebesgue stieltjes measure does not exist on the other hand if riemann sums of the increments of the process yt are used then by cancelation a finite result is obtained for each riemann sum a result which agrees with what is intuitively expected in the standard lebesgue or ito theory of stochastic integration in 3 for instance this problem is evaded by postulating a finite measure y j for each sample path and then constructing a weak form of integral which in the case of brownian motion is based on certain helpful properties of this process the trouble with this approach is that it produces a quite difficult the ory which does not lend itself to the natural intuitive interpretation described above 3 but section 6 shows that lebesgue integrals are essentially riemann stieltjes integrals 5 however elementary riemann sum based integration is not generally con sidered to have the analytical power possessed by lebesgue style integration and a great deal of analytical power is required in the theory of stochastic pro cesses so at first sight it seems that we are stuck with the standard theory of stochastic integration along with all its baggage of subtlety and complication but this is not really the case the good news is that is actually possible to formulate the theory of stochastic integrals using riemann sums instead of the measures of lebesgue theory 4 integration of functions to see this it is first necessary to review the various kinds of integration which are available to us first consider the basic riemann integral b a f s ds of a real valued bounded continuous function f s on an interval a b let p be a partition of a b p a t 0 t 1 t 2 tn b for any choice of positive integer n and any choice of tj 1 j n for any u v and any interval i with end points u and v write i v u denoting intervals tj 1 tj by ij let up n j 1 pj ij lp n j 1 pj ij where pj sup f s s ij pj inf f s s ij definition 1 define the upper riemann integral of f by u inf lp all partitions p of a b and the lower riemann integral of f by l sup lp all partitions p of a b then up lp for all p and if u l we say that f is riemann integrable with b a f s ds u l write the partition p as i where each i has the form ij tj 1 tj with ij tj tj 1 and riemann sum p f s i n j 1 f sj ij 6 suppose g s is a real valued monotone increasing function of s a b so g s g s for s s for any interval i with end points u and v u v define the increment or interval function g i to be g v g u definition 2 if i and ij are replaced by g i and g ij in definition 1 of the riemann integral then the resulting integral is called the riemann stieltjes integral of f with respect to g b a f dg or b a f s dg s in fact if we start with the latter definition the riemann integral is a special case of it obtained by taking the point function g to be the identity function g s s if g s has bounded variation it can be expressed as the difference of two monotone increasing non negative point functions g s g s g s and the riemann stieltjes integral of f with respect to g can then be defined as the difference of the riemann stieltjes integrals of f with respect to g and g respectively the following result is well known if real valued bounded f is continuous and if real valued g has bounded variation then b a f dg exists as suggested earlier the lebesgue integral of a real valued point function k with respect to a measure can be viewed essentially as a riemann stieltjes integral in which the point integrand k satisfies the condition of measura bility to explain this statement further consider a measure space a with non negative measure on a sigma algebra a of measurable subsets of the arbitrary measurable space thus if 1 the measure space is a probability space suppose the point integrand k is a bounded real valued measurable function on the domain then there exist real numbers c and d for which c k d for all also for each sub interval j of c d measurability of k implies k 1 j is defined the basic definition of the lebesgue integral of k with respect to on is as follows definition 3 let q jj vj 1 vj be a partition of c d q c v 0 v 1 v 2 vn d and let lq n j 1 vj 1 k 1 jj uq n j 1 vj k 1 jj let l sup lq q u inf uq q the supremum and infimum being taken over all partitions q of c d if l u then their common value is the lebesgue integral k d 7 an advantage of lebesgue integration over riemann integration is that the for mer has theorems such as the dominated and monotone convergence theorems which under certain condition make it possible for instance to change the order of integration and differentiation also fubini s and tonelli s theorems allow exchange of order of multiple integrals what makes good properties such as these possible is measurability of the integrand k but the lebesgue integral itself is by definition a riemann stieltjes type integral to see this for each u c d define the monotone increasing function g u k 1 c u 5 and take the point function h u to be the identity function h u u then the construction 4 in definition 3 shows that k d d c h u dg u d c u dg 6 in other words when combined with the measurability property of the point integrand this particular riemann stieltjes construction gives the good prop erties required in the integration of functions 5 riemann definition but in fact a riemann construction can give these good properties without postulating measurability in the definition 5 of the integral to see this we start again by considering a more general and more flexible definition of basic riemann and riemann stieltjes integration which generalizes the construction of these integrals as given above in definitions 1 and 2 the proposed more general definition of the riemann stieltjes integral is applicable to real or complex valued functions f bounded or not and to real or complex valued functions g with or without bounded variation definition 4 the function f is riemann stieltjes integrable with respect to g with integral if given 0 there exists a constant 0 such that for every partition p i of a b satisfying i for each i p the corresponding riemann sum satisfies p f s g i so b a f dg 4 the integral of a point function h u with respect to a point function g u can be ad dressed either as a riemann stieltjes construction or as a lebesgue stieltjes construction when h u u and g u k 1 c u the former approach gives the lebesgue inte gral k d on the other hand if the lebesgue stieltjes construction is attempted with h u u and g u k 1 c u we simply replicate the riemann stieltjes construction of the lebesgue integral k d and nothing new emerges 5 and if measurability is redundant in the definition then so is the measure space structure 8 if g is the identity function g s s then definition 4 reduces to the ordinary riemann integral of f b a f s ds definition 4 does not embody conditions which ensure the existence of the integral such integrability conditions are not postulated but are deduced in the form of theorems from the definition of the integral thus if the function properties specified respectively in definitions 1 2 and 3 above are assumed the integrability in each case follows from definition 4 and definitions 1 2 and 3 become theorems of riemann riemann stieltjes and lebesgue integration respectively definition 3 can now be expressed in terms of definition 4 using the formu lations 5 and 6 and assuming measurability of the integrand f with respect to measure space a definition 5 the function f is lebesgue integrable with respect to measure with integral f d if given 0 there exists a constant 0 such that for every partition q j of c d satisfying j for each j q the corresponding riemann sum satisfies q h u g j where h u u is the identity function on c d so d c h u dg u d c u dg thus by definition the lebesgue integral f d with domain is the riemann stieltjes integral d c u dg with domain c d the following result is an obvious consequence of definition 4 if f has constant value and if g is an arbitrary real or complex valued function then b a f dg exists and equals g b g a this follows directly from definition 4 since for every partition p of a b cancelation of terms gives p f s g i n j 1 g tj g tj 1 g b g a this result does not in general hold for lebesgue stieltjes integration as the latter requires that g s be resolved into its negative and non negative compo nents g s g s g s and convergence may fail when the integral is calculated with respect to each of these components separately example 1 below shows that though constant functions f are riemann stieltjes integrable with respect to any integrator function g this does not nec essarily extend to step functions f definition 4 of the riemann or riemann stieltjes integral does not postulate any boundedness continuity measurability or other conditions for the integrand f but as already stated in the absence of integrand measurability and the construction in definition 3 this method of integration does not deliver good versions of monotone and dominated convergence theorems or fubini s theorem 9 6 complete integration developments in the subject since the 1950 s developments which were orig inated independently by r henstock and j kurzweil have made good this deficit in the basic riemann and riemann stieltjes construction in this new development of the subject definition 4 of the riemann stieltjes integral is amended as follows definition 6 a function f is stieltjes complete integrable with respect to a function g with integral if given 0 there exists a function s 0 such that p f s g i for every partition p such that in each term f s g i of the riemann sum we have s s u s v s s where u and v are the end points of the partitioning interval i in other words where i is less than a constant in the basic riemann stieltjes definition we have i s in the new definition write a b f s g i or a b f dg for the stieltjes complete integral whenever it exists again if the integrator function g is the identity function g s s the resulting integral corresponding to the basic riemann integral is the riemann complete integral of f written a b f s i or a b f s ds the latter is also known as the henstock integral the kurzweil integral the henstock kurzweil the generalized riemann integral or the gauge integral since in this context the function s 0 is called a gauge it is obvious that every riemann riemann stieltjes integrable integrand is also riemann complete stieltjes complete integrable as the gauge function s 0 of definition 4 can be taken to be the constant 0 of definition 1 and definition 2 this argument indicates a lebesgue complete extension of the lebesgue in tegral by replacing the constant 0 of definition 5 with a variable gauge u 0 definition 7 let h u u be the identity function on c d the function f is lebesgue complete integrable with respect to measure with integral f d if given 0 there exists a gauge u 0 for c u d such that q h u g j for every partition q j of c d satisfying u u vj 1 u vj u u for each j vj 1 vj q 10 in that case c d h u g j c d u g j and the lebesgue complete inte gral is a special case of the stieltjes complete integral a special case in which a measure space structure exists and for which the integrand is measurable so it is again clear that every lebesgue integrable integrand is lebesgue complete integrable since the former is in effect a riemann stieltjes integral the latter is a stieltjes complete integral and every riemann stieltjes integrable function is also stieltjes complete integrable no special notation has been introduced here to distinguish the lebesgue integral f d from its lebesgue complete counterpart if the measurable domain is a real interval such as a b then some ambi guity arises in the interpretation of the lebesgue integral as an integral of the gauge or generalized riemann kind the reason for the ambiguity is as follows assuming the existence of the lebesgue integral f d a b f d where now represents real numbers in the domain a b then we are assured of the existence of the stieltjes and stieltjes complete or lebesgue complete integrals d c u dg and c d u g j respectively with a b f d d c u dg c d u g j where the values u h u are elements of c d and h is the identity function on c d but in this case letting s denote points of the domain a b and with i denoting subintervals of a b the function i is defined on intervals i and two different stieltjes type constructions are possible first there is the riemann stieltjes integral d c u dg which defines the leb esgue integral f d a b f d secondly there is the gauge integral a b f s i which has a stieltjes complete construction it is then meaningful to consider whether with f measurable existence of the lebesgue integral a b f d implies existence of the stieltjes complete integral a b f s i and whether d c u dg a b f s i holds 6 the first of these integrals being the lebesgue integral a b f d which by definition 5 is interpreted as the riemann stieltjes integral d c u dg to see that these two integrals coincide take f to be a bounded measurable function on a b this can be expressed as the difference of two non negative 6 there is a considerable literature on this question which is usually answered as every lebesgue integrable function on an interval of the real numbers r is also henstock kurzweil integrable if the domain of the integrand is a measurable space which is not a subset of r or rn then the appropriate way to formulate the corresponding henstock kurzweil or complete integral is in the form c d u g j described in definition 7 11 bounded measurable functions f and f accordingly and without loss of generality take f to be non negative bounded measurable then the lebesgue integrable function f is the almost everywhere point wise limit of a mono tone increasing sequence of step functions fj with s each step func tion fj is lebesgue integrable with lebesgue integral a b fj d and each step function fj is stieltjes complete integrable with stieltjes complete integral a b fj s i and a b fj d a b fj s i for each j this statement is also true if lebesgue integral and lebesgue integrability are replaced by lebesgue complete integral and lebesgue complete integrability by the monotone convergence theorem of lebesgue integration or respec tively by the monotone convergence theorem of lebesgue complete integration a b fj d a b f d as j by the monotone convergence theorem of stieltjes complete integra tion f s i is stieltjes complete integrable and a b fj s i a b f s i as j since corresponding integrals of the pair of sequences are equal their limits are equal a b f d a b f s i this is the gist of a proof that existence of a lebesgue integral or of a lebesgue integral on a real domain implies existence of the corresponding stieltjes complete integral on the same domain and equality of the two thus the above argument can be applied to either the lebesgue or the lebesgue complete integral on a b in conjunction respectively with the corresponding stieltjes complete integral on the same domain in effect if the domain is a subset of r and if f is lebesgue integrable or lebesgue complete integrable with respect to then f s i is also stieltjes complete integrable and the two integrals are equal the specific properties of the lebesgue complete integral have not been in vestigated as mentioned earlier constant functions f are riemann stieltjes integrable and hence stieltjes complete integrable with respect to any integrator function g but as the following counter example shows this does not necessarily extend to step functions f or any other functions which are not constant 12 example 1 dirichlet function for 0 s 1 let d s be 1 if s is rational and 0 otherwise for i u v let d i d v d u let d 0 v d v d 0 the point function d s is discontinuous everywhere and has infinite variation on every interval j 0 1 if f s is constant for 0 s 1 then the riemann stieltjes integral 1 0 f s dd exists and equals d 1 d 0 that is 1 0 f s dd 0 but if f is not constant on 0 1 then the riemann stieltjes integral of f with respect to d does not exist what about stieltjes complete integrability of f s d i in fact if f is not constant on 0 1 then the stieltjes complete integral of f with respect to d does not exist this is proved in theorem 1 of 1 and the proof is reproduced in theorem 67 of 2 thus f s d i is riemann stieltjes integrable and stieltjes complete integrable on 0 1 if and only if f s is constant for 0 s 1 historically this is the first published result theorem 1 of 1 in the theory of complete integration 7 complete approach to stochastic integrals returning to stochastic integrals the complete method of integration allows us to construct stieltjes type riemann sums for highly oscillatory expressions which include both positive and negative terms cancelation of terms can oc cur in the riemann sum approximations so the possibility of convergence is preserved by this construction the lebesgue construction on the other hand requires integral convergence separately and independently of the positive and negative components of the integrand the difficulty this presents is illustrated in the alternating or oscil lating series j 1 1 jj 1 if the positive and negative terms of the series are considered as two separate series then each of them diverges but the series itself is conditionally or non absolutely convergent similarly for sample paths y s of a stochastic process yt the integral 0 t dy s does not generally exist when considered as a lebesgue stieltjes integral but it exists for all sample paths yt with value y t y 0 when considered as a stieltjes complete integral there is no analytical cost or disadvantage in relinquishing the lebesgue construction in favor of the complete method this is because the important theorems of lebesgue integration such as monotone and dominated conver gence are also valid for the complete approach furthermore there are other convergence theorems of a similar kind specifically designed to deal with highly oscillatory functions such as those which occur in the theory of stochastic pro cesses but which are beyond the scope of the lebesgue method see 2 for details of these however stochastic integration includes novelties and challenges which have not yet been addressed in this essay for brownian motion processes xt one of the most important stochastic integrals is t 0 dx 2 s t the corresponding integral for a sample path x s 0 s t is t 0 dx s 2 but this expression does not have the familiar form 13 of a stieltjes type integral b a f s dg which when g is the identity function reduces to the even more familiar b a f s ds in riemann sum approximation we are dealing with expressions x i 2 where for i u v x i x v x u but traditionally while a riemann sum for a stieltjes integral involves terms f s x i with integrator function x i in which f s can be identically 1 we do not usually expect to see integrators such as x i 2 or dx 2 s another important stochastic integral brownian motion theory is t 0 xsdxs 1 2 x 2 t 1 2 t for a sample path x s of brownian motion this involves t 0 x s dx s or in riemann sum terms x s x i the latter as it stands is a finite sum of terms x s x v x u where i u v and u s v and if we are using the stieltjes complete approach as described above then we might suppose that each s in the riemann sum is the special point used in partitions which are constrained by a gauge s s s u s v s s but in fact this is not what is required in the stochastic integral t 0 xsdxs in riemann sum format what is required is x u x i or x u x v x u where the first factor x u in the integrand is a point function evaluated at the left hand end point u of the interval i u v sometimes the form x w x v x u is used with w u 1 2 v u in a way integrands of form x i 2 x u x i or x w x i are an unexpected innovation their value is calculated from the numbers u and v which specify the interval i so they can be thought of as functions h i of intervals i but these functions are not additive on intervals 7 in that regard they are unlike the integrators i and x i which are themselves functions of i but are finitely additive on intervals in the sense that if j i 1 in is an interval then j n j 1 ij x j n j 1 x ij broadly speaking integration is a summation process in which the summed terms involve functions of intervals up to this point in this essay the only integrands to be considered included a factor which was an additive function of intervals i such as the length function i or the stieltjes type functions g i 7 if h i were finitely additive on intervals i it could be used to define a point function h s h 0 s and vice versa integrals with respect to finitely additive integrators are therefore representable as stieltjes type integrals and vice versa 14 or x i but there is nothing inherent in the definition of complete integrals that requires any i dependent factor in the integrand to be additive with this in mind consider again the definition of the complete integral on an interval a b firstly a gauge is a function s 0 a s b given s an interval i u v for which s is either an end point or an interior point is s fine if s u s and v s s a finite collection d s 1 i 1 sn in is a division of a b if each sj is either an interior point or end point of ij and the intervals ij form a partition of a b given a gauge a division d is fine if each sj ij d is fine now suppose h is a function of elements s i examples include h s i h 1 i i h s i h 2 s s h 3 s i s 2 i h 4 i i 2 given a division d s i of a b whose intervals i form a partition p the corresponding riemann sum is d h s i h s i i p definition 8 a function h s i is integrable on a b with integral a b h s i if given 0 there exists a gauge s 0 so that for each fine division d of a b d h s i applying this definition to the examples h 1 is integrable with integral b a h 2 is not integrable h 3 is integrable with integral 1 3 b 3 a 3 and h 4 is integrable with integral 0 if h s i h 5 i u 2 i where for each i u is the left hand end point of i then it is not too hard to show that h 5 is integrable with integral 1 3 b 3 a 3 actually it is the traditional custom and practice in this subject to only consider integrands h s i f s p i where the integrator function p i is a measure function or at least finitely additive on intervals i and where the evaluation point s of the point function integrand f s is the point s of s i for each s i d when p i i this convention is needed in order to prove the fundamental theorem of calculus 8 but while the fundamental theorem of calculus is important in subjects such as differential equations it hardly figures at all in some other branches of mathematics such as probability theory or stochastic processes and we have seen that stochastic integration often requires point integrands f s to be evaluated not at the points s of s i d but at the left hand end points of the partitioning intervals i so with i u v f u is in fact an integrand function which depends not on points s but on intervals u v 8 the fundamental theorem of calculus states that if f s f s then f s is integrable on a b with definite integral equal to f b f a 15 these are a few of the unexpected innovations to be encountered in stochas tic integration giving it a somewhat alien and counter intuitive feel to anyone versed in the traditional methods of calculus for instance the stochastic integral t 0 xdx is given the value 1 2 x t 2 1 2 t when the process x s with x 0 0 is a brownian motion introductory treatments of this problem sometimes contrast the expression t 0 xdx with the elementary calculus integral xdx whose indefinite integral is 1 2 x 2 in which the use of symbols x and x can in the mind of an inexperienced reader set up an inappropriate and misleading analogy in terms of sample paths the stochastic integral t 0 x s dx s has represen tative sample form t 0 x s dx s which is a stieltjes type integral with integrator function x i x v x u formed from a typically zig zag brownian path x s 0 s t with x 0 0 then the notation for the contrasting elementary calculus integral is not x dx but s ds with value 1 2 s 2 putting the latter in stieltjes terms s ds is the stieltjes integral t 0 x s dx s where the sample path path or function x is the identity function x s s 0 s t clearly a stieltjes integral involving a typical brownian path x s which though continuous is typically nowhere differentiable is a very different beast from a stieltjes integral involving the straight line path x s s so in reality it is not surprising that there is a very big difference between the two integrals x s dx s 2 1 2 x t 2 1 2 t and s ds 1 2 s 2 7 the first integral typically involves stieltjes integrals using very complicated and difficult brownian paths x s it should be distinguished sharply from the more familiar and simpler stieltjes integrals in which for instance the point function component of the integrand is a continuous function and the integrator or interval function is formed from increments of a monotone increasing or bounded variation function it is easy to overlook this distinction example 60 of 2 illustrates the potential pitfall in this example xt is an arbitrary stochastic process and with a fixed partition of t 0 t 0 0 1 m t the function s is constant for j 1 s j example 60 claims in effect that the stochastic integral j j 1 s dxs exists for each j in the same way that for constant j j 1 dxs exists and equals x j x j 1 but example 1 above shows that this claim is false as a step function j 1 is not generally equal to the constant s when s j 1 so if the sample path x s is the dirichlet function d s the stieltjes integral j j 1 s dx s does not exist and the claim in example 60 is invalid however if xt is a brownian motion process then each of the significant sample paths x s satisfies a condition of uniform continuity in that case ex ample 60 is valid but it requires some proof similar to the proof of theorem 229 on the succeeding page so what is truly surprising in 7 is not that the two integrals give very 16 different results but that any convergence at all can be found for the first integral why is this so this essay has avoided giving any precise meaning to expr essions such as t 0 xdx or even to a random variable xs but the meaning of the random variable t 0 xdx is somehow representative of a stieltjes type integral which can be formulated for every sample path x s 0 s t these sample paths may consist of joined up straight line segments as in the archetypical jagged line brownian motion diagram or smooth paths or every where discontinuous paths like the dirichlet function thus any claim that all of the separate and individual stieltjes integrals t 0 x s dx s of the class of such sample paths x a very large class indeed have integral values 1 2 x t 2 1 2 t must be somehow challenging and dubious the integrals t 0 dx s x t t 0 dx s x t show that each member of a large class of stieltjes integrals can indeed yield a common single simple result our discussion of the riemann sum calculation of these integrals illustrates how this happens regardless of the values of x s for s t adding up increments ensures that all values x s cancel out except the terminal value x t thus if f s takes constant value for 0 s t then for every sample path x s the riemann stieltjes and stieltjes complete integral t 0 f s dx s exists and t 0 f s dx s x t or x t x 0 if x 0 6 0 this is the basis of the claim that the stochastic integral t 0 f s dx s exists and is the random variable x t however example 1 demonstrates that caution must be exercised in pursu ing further the logic of riemann sum cancelation because if the sample path x s d s the expression f s d i is not integrable on 0 t in either the riemann stieltjes sense or the stieltjes complete sense even when f s is a step function non constant it is indeed possible to take the riemann sum cancelation idea further the orem 229 of 2 shows how this can be done but many important stochastic integrands are not actually integrable in the basic sense of the definition 8 if various sample paths x s are experimented with in the integral t 0 dx 2 s many different results will be found so what is the meaning of the result t 0 dx 2 s t while for different sample paths x t 0 dx 2 s is not generally convergent to any definite value there is a weak sense of convergence of the integral which makes t 0 dx 2 s t meaningful most importantly in this case the weak limit t is a fixed quantity rather than a random or unpredictable quantity such as x t but this question goes beyond the scope of the present essay whose aim is to explore some of the basic concepts of this subject and hopefully to illuminate them a little a more extensive exploration is given
