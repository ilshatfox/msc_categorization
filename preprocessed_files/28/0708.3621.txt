shows how to decide that the mo bius invariant space qp covering bmoa and b is boundedly resp compactly embedded in the quadratic tent type space t p interestingly the embedding result can be used to determine the boundedness resp the compactness of the volterra type and multiplication operators on qp 1 introduction continuing from 30 we answer the following question i e the carleson mea sure problem for the holomorphic q spaces which are geometric in the sense that they are conformally invariant question 1 1 let be a nonnegative borel measure on d what geometric finite resp vanishing property must have in order that qp is boundedly resp compactly embedded in t p here d z c z 1 and p 0 are given and qp stands for the space of all holomorphic functions f on d satisfying f qp f 0 sup w d d f z 2 1 w z 2 pdm z where w z w z 1 w z and dm are the mo bius map sending w c to 0 and the lebesgue area measure on c respectively see 31 and 32 for an overview of the qp theory from 1995 to

particular d z 1 z 2 pdm z and p 0 1 lead to the square tent space on d extending the disc version of the classic one p 1 on the upper half euclidean space discussed in 11 and 10 because the norm of f qp is comparably dominated by the geometric quantity see also aulaskari stegenga xiao 5 f 0 sup s i d i p s i f z 2 1 z 2 pdm z our answer to question 1 1 is naturally as follows theorem 1 1 let be a nonnegative borel measure on d then the identity operator i qp 7 t p is bounded resp compact if and only if lcmp sup s i d s i i p log 2 i 2 resp lim i 0 s i i p log 2 i 2 0 based on the solution to question 1 1 we also answer the following problem question 1 2 let g be holomorphic on d what finite resp vanishing property must g have in order that vg or ug or mg is bounded resp compact on qp here vg and ug denote the volterra type operators with the holomorphic symbol g on d respectively vgf z z 0 g w f w dw and ugf z z 0 g w f w dw z d at the same time mg is the pointwise multiplication determined by mgf z f z g z f 0 g 0 vgf z ugf z z d of course in the above definition f is assumed to be holomorphic on d clearly vgf ufg and this operator generalizes the classic cesa ro operator c f z z 1 z 0 f w 1 w 1 dw see also siskakis 21 for a survey on the study of such operators below is the answer to question 1 2 theorem 1 2 let g be holomorphic on d d p g z 1 z 2 p g z 2 dm z and g h supz d g z then i vg is bounded resp compact on qp if and only if p g lcmp resp lim i 0 i p log 2 2 i p g s i 0 ii ug is bounded resp compact on qp if and only if g h resp g 0 iii mg is bounded resp compact on qp if and only if p g lcmp and g h resp g 0 the proofs of theorems 1 1 1 2 will be given in the subsequent two sections where the symbol u v will mean that there are two constants c 1 and c 2 independent of said or implied variables or functions such that c 1 v u c 2 v and u c 2 v will be simply written as u v the author is grateful to k zhu for his helpful reply to a question on the compact multiplication operator on the bloch space but also to j pau and j a pelaez for their valuable discussions on the qp multiplier conjecture posed in 30 the qp carleson measure problem 3 2 proof of theorem 1 1 suppose the statement before the if and only if of theorem 1 1 is true given a subarc i of t if fw z log 1 w z where w 1 i and is the center of i then fw z log 2 i 1 z s i and i p s i fw 2 d fw 2 qp 1 accordingly lcmp 1 conversely let the statement after the if and only if of theorem 1 1 be true to approach the desired embedding inequality we recall that a nonnegative borel measure on d is said to be a carleson measure for the weighted dirichlet space dp of all holomorphic functions f obeying f dp f 0 d f z 2 1 z 2 pdm z provided d f 2 d f 2 dp see also stegenga 24 note that p 1 and p 1 lead to the carleson measure for the hardy space h 2 d 1 and the weighted bergman space of all holomorphic functions in the lebesgue space l 2 1 z 2 p 1 dm z with respect to 1 z 2 p 1 dm z the following important result written as a lemma for our purpose is due to carleson 9 for p 1 hastings 13 for p 2 stegenga 24 for p 1 and arcozzi rochberg sawyer 3 for p 0 1 lemma 2 1 let be a nonnegative borel measure on d i if p 1 then is a carleson measure for dp if and only if cmdp sup s i d i p s i ii if p 0 1 then is a carleson measure for dp if and only if cmdp sup w d s w 1 s w s z s w 2 1 z 2 p 2 dm z where s w z d 1 z 1 w arg wz 1 w and s w z d 1 z 2 1 w arg wz 1 w are the carleson and heightened carleson boxes with vertex at w d respectively since lcmp and lim i 0 log 2 i 1 is a carleson measure for dp this fact in the case p 1 is clear from lemma 2 1 i because of cmdp lcmp if p 0 1 then this fact is due to pau pelaez 19 and follows from lemma 2 1 but a short proof is included below for completeness 4 jie xiao fixing a point w d we use fubini s theorem to get s w s z s w 2 1 z 2 p 2 dm z s w s w s z s w 1 z 2 p 2 dm z s w s z s w 2 1 z 2 p 2 dm z 2 lcmp s w s w s w

given any subarc i of t let w 1 i and be the center of i then f w f qp log 2 i 1 f qp and 1 w 2 1 w z 2 i 1 z s i consequently the above verified fact that is a carleson measure for dp yields i p s i

to check this estimate we extend largely pau perlaez s argument in 19 from p 0 1 to p 0 choosing 0 p 2 and u z v we get by zhu s 36 the qp carleson measure problem 5 theorem 1 12 1 that for any z d d

example 20 2 1 and 35 p 75 ex 11 cauchy bunyakovsky schwarz s inequality fubini s theorem and zhu s 36 theorem 1 12 3 implies a series of estimates below f w p d f w z f w 0 2 1 w z 2 1 z 2 pdm z d d

2 p 1 w z 2 dm u f 2 qp as desired next we verify the compactness part according to lemma 2 10 in 25 it suffices to show that any bounded sequence fj in qp with fj 0 being uniform on compacta of d must obey fj t p 0 assume first the vanishing condition in theorem 1 1 holds for r 0 1 define the cut off measure d r 1 z d r z d where 1 e denotes the characteristic function of a set e d if r 1 then sup s i d r s i i p log 2 i 2 sup i 1 r s i i p log 2 i 2 0 suppose fj qp 1 and fj 0 uniformly on compacta of d then the limit limj fj t p 0 follows from s i fj 2 d s i fj 21 z d z r d fj 2 qp log 2 2 i 1 r s i on the other hand suppose i qp 7 t p is compact let ij be a sequence of subarcs of t such that ij 0 if j is the center of ij wj 1 ij j and fj z log 1 1 wj 2 1 log 1 1 wjz 2 6 jie xiao then fj qp 1 and fj 0 uniformly on compacta of d by the compactness of i we achieve that if j then 0 fj 2 t p ij p s ij fj 2 d s ij ij p log 2 ij 2 in other words the desired vanishing condition is valid remark 2 2 using 28 theorem 6 or 32 theorem 2 5 2 we can readily prove f qp f 0 sup w d d f z f w 1 z 2 2 1 w z 2 pdm z which is slightly different from the conjectured inequality f qp f 0 sup w d f w p if this last estimate is true then a new derivative free characterization of qp is discovered 3 proof of theorem 1 2 i note that vgf z f z g z so the boundedness part of theorem 1 1 implies that vg maps boundedly qp into itself is equivalent to p g lcmp as desired the corresponding compactness can be demonstrated similarly nevertheless in the sequel we provide a different argument which seems to be of independent interest we begin with the following density result lemma 3 1 if lqp and lqp 0 denote the spaces of all holomorphic functions g on d such that p g lcmp and lim i 0 i p log 2 2 i p g s i 0 respectively then g lqp 0 if and only if g lqp and limr 1 p g gr lcmp 0 where gr z g rz is the 0 1 r dilation of g in fact as in 30 remark 1 6 we have that g lqp respectively g lqp 0 is equivalent to sup w d log 2 1 w 2 2 d 1 w 2 1 w z 2 p d p g z respectively g lqp and lim w 1 log 2 1 w 2 2 d 1 w 2 1 w z 2 p d p g z 0 following the arguments for 22 lemma 3 5 and 27 theorem 2 1 we can reach the assertion described in lemma 3 1 assume now vg is compact on qp for each natural number j let ij be the subarc of t with center j and limit ij 0 if wj 1 ij j then wj has a cluster point w 0 t passing to a subsequence we may assume that wj w 0 t and fj f 0 uniformly on compacta of d where fj z log 1 wjz and f 0 z log 1 w 0 z the qp carleson measure problem 7 then vg fj f 0 qp 0 as in the proof of theorem 1 1 we obtain ij p log 2 2 ij p g s ij ij p s ij fj z 2 d p g z ij p s ij fj z f 0 z 2 d p g z s ij f 0 z 2 d p g z vg fj f 0 2 qp ij p s ij f 0 z 2 d p g z in the meantime if qp 0 stands for the space of all functions f qp with lim w 1 d f z 2 1 w z 2 pdm z 0 then qp 0 is a closed subspace of qp and the second dual of qp 0 is isomorphic to qp under the cauchy pairing see 1 f h 2 1 lim r 1 t f r h r d hence vg is compact and so weakly compact on qp 0 if v g denotes the adjoint of vg acting on the dual space q p 0 of qp 0 under then the adjoint v g of v g is not only bounded but also equal vg on qp which can be established through the following formula for f qp 0 and h q p 0 vg f h f v g h v g h f h v g f v g f h accordingly vg maps qp into qp 0 this implies vg f 0 qp 0 and so lim j ij p s ij f 0 z 2 d p g z 0 consequently lim j ij p log 2 2 ij p g s ij 0 this actually means g lqp 0 on the other hand suppose g lqp 0 using the uniform continuity of g r on the closed unit disk d and lemma 3 1 we obtain a sequence of polynomials pk such that limk p g pk lcmp 0 it is not hard to see that vpk is compact on qp as a matter of fact let fj be any sequence with fj qp 1 and fj 0 uniformly on compacta of d then for the polynomial pk the number r 0 1 and the cut off measure dmp r z 1 z 2 p 1 z d z r dm z we use the boundedness part 8 jie xiao of theorem 1 1 to obtain vpkfj 2 qp p k 2 h sup s i d i p s i fj z 2 1 z 2 pdm z p k 2 h z d z r fj z 2 dm z sup s i d i p s i fj z 2 dmp r z p k 2 h z d z r fj z 2 dm z fj 2 qp mp r 2 lcmp p k 2 h z d z r fj z 2 dm z 1 r sup s i d i log 2 2 i note that to 0 there corresponds an r 0 0 1 and a natural number n such that j n implies 1 r 0 and z d z r 0 fj z 2 dm z accordingly limj vpkfj qp 0 yielding the compactness of vpk qp 7 qp therefore the following estimate vg vpk vg pk p g pk lcmp derives the compactness of vg on qp ii if g h then the boundedness of ug follows from ugf qp g h f qp f qp conversely suppose ug is bounded on qp then its operator norm ug given a nonzero point w d there exists a carleson square s i such that z d w z 2 1 s i and 1 w 2 i choosing fw z w 1 log 1 w z we employ the boundedness of ug to obtain fw qp 1 and i p g w 2 z d w z 1 2 g z 2 1 z 2 p 1 w z 2 dm z s i g z 2 1 z 2 p 1 w z 2 dm z ug fw 2 qp i p ug 2 i p and consequently g h as with the compactness it is enough to verify that if ug qp 7 qp is compact then g 0 according to the boundedness part of ii the compactness of ug on qp implies g h now assume g is not identically equal to 0 then the boundary value function g t cannot be identically the zero function thanks to the maximum principle accordingly there is a positive constant and a sequence wj in d such the qp carleson measure problem 9 that wj w 0 t and g wj using the classical schwarz s lemma for h we readily get g z 1 g z 2 2 g h z 1 z 2 z 1 z 2 d this inequality implies that there is a sufficiently small number r 0 such that g z 2 for all j and z obeying wj z r note that each pseudo hyperbolic ball z d wj z r is contained in a carleson box s ij with ij 1 wj 2 so if fj z log 1 wjz and f 0 z log 1 w 0 z then fj f 0 0 uniformly on compacta of d by making a change of variable z wj u and noticing w 0 wj 1 we obtain a series of estimates below ug fj f 0 2 qp ij p s ij f j z f 0 z 2 g z 2 1 z 2 pdm z ij p s ij wj w 0 1 wjz 1 w 0 z 2 g z 2 1 z 2 pdm z 2 ij p z d wj z r wj w 0 1 wjz 1 w 0 z 2 1 z 2 pdm z 2 ij p 1 wj 2 p u d u r 1 u 2 p w 0 wj 2 1 wju 2 p 1 u wj w 0 2 dm u 2 u d u r 1 u pdm u however the compactness of ug on qp forces ug fj f 0 2 qp 0 and conse quently 0 contradicting 0 therefore g must be the zero function iii the if part follows immediately from the corresponding ones of i and ii to see the only if part note that fw z log 2 1 w z belongs to qp uniformly i e fw qp 1 and any function f qp has the growth f z f qp log 2 1 z 2 z d so if mg is bounded on qp then for fixed w d fw z g z mgfw qp log 2 1 z 2 mg log 2 1 z 2 z d and hence g w mg upon taking z w in the last estimate that is g h equivalently ug is bounded on qp by the boundedness part of ii consequently vgf mgf f 0 g 0 ugf gives the boundedness of vg on qp and then p g lcmp suppose now mg is compact on qp then this operator is bounded and hence g h for any nonzero sequence wj in d let fj z log 1 1 wj 2 1 log 1 1 wjz 2 10 jie xiao assume wj 1 then fj qp 1 and fj 0 uniformly on any compacta of d so mg fj qp 0 because of g z fj z mg fj z mg fj qp log 2 1 z 2 z d we get by letting z wj g wj log 1 1 wj 2 mg fj qp log 2 1 wj 2 whence g wj 0 since g is bounded holomorphic function on d it follows that g 0 we are done remark 3 2 the boundedness part of mg plus xiao s theorem 1 3 i and corol lary 1 4 in 30 implies that g m qp g qp mg qp qp if and only if g h and sup w d log 2 1 w 2 2 d g z 2 1 w z 2 pdm z this equivalence proves conjecture 1 5 in 30 where p 0 1 which has been verified in pau pelaez s recent work 19 moreover this equivalence and 30 the orem 3 3 indicate that the carleson s corona decomposition theorem is valid for the multipliers of qp p 0 1 that is for finitely many of holomorphic functions g 1 gn the following operator m g 1 gn f 1 fn n j 1 fjgj maps m qp m qp onto m qp is completely determined by the following two conditions inf z d n j 1 gj z 0 and g 1 gn m qp m qp this result has been proved recently by pau in 18 using 32 theorem 2 5 2 note that the case p 1 of the result is due to tolokonnikov 26 but the case p 1 remains open of course the corona type decompositions for all qp are known see also 30 for p 0 1 16 for p 1 and 17 for p 1 furthermore the results on boundedness and compactness of vg on bmoa and b can be seen from siskakis zhao 22 zhao 33 and maccluer zhao 14 while the boundedness result of ug acting on bmoa is due to danikas 12 finally the boundedness descriptions of mg acting on bmoa and b can be found in stegenga 23 arazy 2 brown shields 8 and zhu 34 meanwhile mg b 7 b is never compact unless g
