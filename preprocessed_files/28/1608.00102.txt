the neutron flux was determined using the monitor reaction 27 al n 24 na the induced gamma ray activities were measured using a low background gamma ray spectrometer equipped with a high resolution hpge detector the experimentally determined cross sections were compared with the literatures data evaluated data of endf b vii jendl 4 0 and cendl 3 1 the excitation functions of 232 th n reaction were also calculated theoretically using the talys 1 6 computer code keywords 232 th n 231 th reaction cross section neutron activation method 1 introduction the database of cross sections for the reactions induced by neutrons around 14 mev plays a key role for the applied physics and the design of nuclear reactors specifically the neutron capture cross section of 232 th is an important parameter for the design of any nuclear reactor based on the th u fuel cycle 1 in this cycle 233 u is the fissile isotope which is formed from 232 th by neutron capture followed by two decays upathnth d 233 975 26 233 min 3 22 233232 moreover the production of the 233 u depends on the 232 th n reaction cross section is currently required within an accuracy of 1 2 in order to be used safely in simulated techniques for predicting the dynamical behavior of complex arrangements in the fast reactor or thorium molten salt reactors tmsr 2 submitted to chinese physics c 2 for the 232 th n 233 th reaction many researchers have been measured the cross section over a wide range of neutron energies from thermal to 17 28 mev 3 around 14 mev only two data of the 232 th n reaction cross section are available at 14 5 mev and 14 8 mev using the activation technique and there is relatively large disagreement and uncertainty between these data meanwhile the discrepancies between the evaluated data files endf b vii 1 4 jendl 4 0 5 cendl 3 1 6 can reach 40 at the neutron energy of 14 1 mev hence the neutron capture reaction cross section of 232 th need further precise measurements to strengthen the reliability of the databases in this paper we present the results of the 232 th n 233 th reaction cross sections in neutron energies of 14 1 and 14 8 mev using the activation method and off line ray spectrometric technique the measured results are discussed and compared with the previous experimental data and evaluated data as well as the calculated results of talys 1 6 code 2 experimental descriptions the two targets thorium dioxide powder of 99 7 purity and monitor aluminum foil of 99 99 purity were made into circular disks with a diameter of 20 mm for irradiation the thickness of tho 2 samples with a thickness of 1 05 mm and 1 07 mm and the thickness of al samples were 0 06 mm a stack of al th al was made from these two samples and mounted at 00 and 900 angles relative to the deuteron beam direction the irradiations were carried out using the cpng 600 neutron generator at china institute of atomic energy ciae the neutrons with the yield of about 1 5 1010 n 4 s were produced by the t d n 4 he reaction the ion beam current was up to 300 a with effective deuteron energy of 300 kev a solid tritium titanium t ti target was used in the generator with the thickness of 1 0 mg cm 2 the neutron energies in these positions were calculated by the q equation 7 and compared with the method of cross section ratios for 90 zr n 2 n 89 m gzr and 93 nb n 2 n 92 mnb reactions 8 9 before irradiation the determined neutron energy submitted to chinese physics c 3 was 14 1 0 2 mev and 14 8 0 2 mev respectively during irradiation the neutron flux was determined using the monitor reaction 27 al n 24 na and the variation of the neutron yield was monitored by accompanying particles so that the corrections could be made for the fluctuation of neutron flux the schematics view of the accompanying a particle monitor was same as shown in ref 10 the au si surface barrier detector used in 135 accompanying particle tube was at a distance of 110 cm from the target the off line ray measurements were performed by a coaxial gmx 60 hpge detector ortec made in usa with a relative efficiency of 68 and an energy resolution of 1 82 kev fwhm at 1 33 mev the efficiency was calibrated with an standard 152 eu source previously the uncertainty in the absolute efficiency curve at 50 mm was estimated to be 3 3 determination of 232 th n 231 th reaction cross sections the decay

can be calculate from the observed photo peak activity of 233 pa within the long cooled spectrum in the calculation the photo peak activity of the 311 904 kev line was selected instead of 300 129 kev and 340 476 kev this is to avoid the interference of the 300 1 kev line of 212 pb which is the decay product from 232 th submitted to chinese physics c 4 and reduce the statistical error of 340 476 kev because of its low ray intensity the following activation formula was used to determine the measured 232 th n 231 th cross sections which proposed by x z kong et al 13 m m x x m x fca fca mksdi

energies from threshold to 20 mev was calculated theoretically using the computer code talys version 1 6 14 15 the talys 1 6 code system is able to analyze and predict nuclear reactions based on physics models and parameterizations it calculate nuclear reactions involving neutrons photons protons deuterons tritons 3 he and alpha particles in the 1 kev 200 mev energy range and for target nuclides of mass 12 and heavier for the 232 th target the optical model parameters for neutrons were obtained by a local potential proposed by koning and delaroche 16 similarly the compound nucleus contribution was calculated by the hauser feshbach model 17 the two component exciton model developed by kalbach 18 was used for calculating the pre equilibrium contribution the default values were used for parameters concerning nuclear masses ground state deformations discrete levels decay schemes and strength functions meanwhile all the possible outgoing channels for a given neutron energy were considered including inelastic and fission channels 5 results and discussion cross sections for 232 th n 231 th reaction at neutron energies of 14 1 and 14 8 mev were determined corrections were also made for ray self absorption in the sample for ray coincidence summing effects for fluctuation of the neutron flux during the irradiation and for sample geometry the uncertainties in our results

the calculations the cross submitted to chinese physics c 6 sections for the 27 al n 24 na monitor reaction were obtained by interpolating the evaluated values of the literature 12 table 2 summary of

al n 24 na 121 6 0 6 111 9 0 5 it can be seen from table 2 our measured results are in good agreement with the literature data 19 but much lower than 20 for purpose of comparison the 232 th n 231 th reaction cross sections from the present work and the similar experimental data from the literatures 21 27 were plotted in fig 1 together with the evaluated data 4 6 as well as the theoretical values from computer code talys 1 6 for the energy range of 1 mev to 20 mev fig 1 plot of the experimental evaluated and theoretical calculated 232 th n 231 th reaction cross sections as a function of the neutron energy from 1 mev to 20 mev experimental values are in different symbols whereas the evaluated and theoretical values from talys are in solid lines of different colors as shown in fig 1 the 232 th n 231 th reaction cross sections show a sharp submitted to chinese physics c 7 decreasing trend from 1 mev to the 7 5 mev and then increasing up to the neutron energy of 12 mev this dip mainly due to the opening of the n 2 n and n nf reaction channels it can be also seen from fig 1 that the experimental cross sections of 232 th within neutron energy of 14 1 14 8 mev are significantly higher than the calculated results from talys and evaluated data from endf b vii 1 jendl 4 0 except the evaluated data of cendl 3 1 6 conclusion we have measured the activation neutron capture cross sections of 232 th at neutron energy of 14 1 and 14 8 mev using the off line gamma ray spectrometric technique during the work we used the lateast nuclear data for decay characteristics of the product radionuclides the excitation function of the 232 th n 231 th reaction were also claculated using computer code talys 1 6 and compared with the recent evaluated data of endf b vii 1 jendl 4 0 and cendl 3 1 our results are useful for verifying the accuracy of nuclear models used in the calculation of cross sections and also be useful for the design evaluation and construciton of nuclear reactor based
