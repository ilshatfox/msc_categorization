math cas cz march 9 2021 abstract we present necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a countably additive measure on a complete boolean algebra 1 statement of results a boolean algebra is an algebra b of subsets of a given nonempty set x with boolean operations a b a b a x a and the zero and unit elements 0 and 1 x a boolean algebra is a boolean algebra b such that every countable set a b has a supremum supa a and an infimum inf a a in the partial ordering of b by inclusion definition 1 1 a measure more precisely a strictly positive additive probability measure on a boolean algebra b is a real valued function m on b such that i m 0 0 m a 0 for a 6 0 and m 1 1 supported in part by the gaav grant iaa 100190509 1 http arxiv org abs math 0612598 v 2 ii m a m b if a b

uncountable antichains b is weakly distributive if for every sequence wn n of partitions there exists a partition w with the property that each a w meets only finitely many elements of each wn if b is a measure algebra then b satisfies ccc and is weakly dis tributive below we present additional purely algebraic conditions that characterize measure algebras if an n is a sequence in a boolean algebra b one defines lim sup n an n 1 k n ak and lim inf n an n 1 k n ak and if lim supn an lim infn an a then a is the limit of the sequence denoted limn an theorem 1 2 a boolean algebra b is a measure

antichain in cn has at most k n elements and ii for every n and all a and b if a b cn then either a cn 1 or b cn 1 if a boolean algebra b satisfies ccc then weak distributivity is equivalent to this condition if wn n is a sequence of partitions then each wn has a finite subset en such that limn en 1 definition 1 5 a boolean algebra b is uniformly weakly distribu tive if there exists a sequence of functions fn n such that for each partition w fn w is a finite subset of w and if wn n is a sequence of countable partitions then limn fn wn 1 definition 1 6 let b be a boolean algebra b is concentrated if for every sequence an of finite antichains with an 2 n there exist an an such that limn an 0 b is uniformly concentrated if there exists a function f such that for each finite antichain a f a is an element of a and if an is a sequence of finite antichains with an 2 n then limn f an 0 theorem 1 7 a boolean algebra b is a measure algebra if and only if it is uniformly weakly distributive and concentrated theorem 1 8 a boolean algebra b is a measure algebra if and only if it is weakly distributive and uniformly concentrated 2 background and definitions we give a brief history of the problem introduce relevant definitions and state the known results for an additional reference and a more detailed history see 14 in particular fremlin s article 6 and 4 the problem of an algebraic characterization of measure algebras originated with john von neumann in 1937 problem 163 in 13 3 he stated that measure algebras satisfy ccc and are weakly distribu tive and asked if these conditions are sufficient for the existence of a measure in 12 dorothy maharam investigated boolean algebras that carry a continuous submeasure and presented necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of such a submeasure as well as of a mea sure definition 2 1 a strictly positive submeasure on a boolean algebra b is a real valued function m on b such that i m 0 0 m a 0 for a 6 0 and m 1 1 ii m a m b if a b iii m a b m a m b a maharam submeasure on a boolean algebra is a submeasure that is continuous iv if an n is a decreasing sequence in b with n 1 an 0 then limnm an 0 a maharam algebra is a boolean algebra that carries a maharam submeasure a measure is a maharam submeasure and every maharam algebra is ccc and weakly distributive maharam asked if every maharam algebra is a measure algebra she also proved that a suslin line if it exists provides an example of a boolean algebra that is ccc and weakly distributive but not a maharam algebra the existence of a suslin line is consistent with the axioms of set theory 17 8 but not provable in zfc 15 in 11 john kelley gave a combinatorial characterization of boolean algebras that carry a finitely additive measure a finitely additive mea sure on a boolean algebra is a function m that satisfies conditions i ii and iii of definition 1 1 he also proved the following theorem due independently to pinsker 10 theorem 2 2 a boolean algebra b carries a measure if an only if it is weakly distributive and carries a finitely additive measure 4 proof let m be a finitely additive measure on b for every partition w let w be the function w b sup m b e e is a finite subset of w and let b inf w b w is a partition the function is additive and weak distributivity implies that b 0 for every b 6 0 a major advance toward the solution of maharam s problem was the following result of nigel kalton and james roberts definition 2 3 a submeasure m on a boolean algebra b is exhaus tive if limnm an 0 for every infinite antichain a an n 1 2 it is uniformly exhaustive if for every 0 there exists some n such that there is no sequence of n disjoint elements a 1 an b with m ai for all i 1 n note that a maharam submeasure is exhaustive while a finitely additive measure is uniformly exhaustive theorem 2 4 kalton roberts 9 if a boolean algebra b carries a uniformly exhaustive submeasure then b carries a finitely additive measure corollary 2 5 if a boolean algebra carries a uniformly exhaustive maharam submeasure then it is a measure algebra the use of the order sequential topology on b introduced by ma haram and developed by bohuslav balcar resulted in further charac terizations of maharam algebras cf 1 and 2 in particular theorem 2 6 balcar jech paza k 2 a boolean algebra b car ries a maharam submeasure if an only if it is ccc and weakly dis tributive and has the g property i e there exists a countable family un nof subsets of b with n 1 un 0 such that for every sequence ak k with limit 0 eventually all ak are in un theorem 2 6 combined with an earlier result of todorcevic 18 shows that it is consistent that a boolean algebra is a maharam algebra if and only if it satisfies ccc and is weakly distributive in 16 michel talagrand solved maharam s problem by construct ing a submeasure on a countable boolean algebra that is exhaustive 5 but not uniformly exhaustive in view of 9 this yields a countably generated maharam algebra that is not a measure algebra the kalton roberts theorem and the balcar jech paza k theorem are the tools we use in the proofs of theorems 1 2 1 8 3 proof of theorems 1 2 1 8 first we verify that measure algebras satisfy the conditions stated in the theorems let m be a measure on a boolean algebra b b is weakly distributive in fact uniformly weakly distributive for each n and every partition w let fn w be a finite subset e of w such that m e 1 1 2 n if wn n is a sequence of partitions and if an fn wn then we have m an 1 2 n and so lim supn an 0 hence limn fn wn 1 for each n let cn be the family of all a b such that m a 1 2 n we have n 1 cn b for every n every antichain in cn has at most 2 n elements and if a b cn then either a cn 1 or b cn 1 if an cn for every n then limn an 0 for every finite antichain a let f a a a be such that m a m x for all x a we have m f a 1 a and so if an n is a sequence of finite antichains with an 2 n then for each n m f an 1 2 n and it follows that limn f an 0 we shall prove that the conditions in theorems 1 2 1 8 imply the existence of a measure lemma 3 1 let b be a weakly distributive boolean algebra that satisfies the conditions of theorem 1 2 then b is uniformly weakly distributive proof let cn n be a countable family that has properties i and ii without loss of generality we may assume that each cn is upward closed i e if a b and a cn then b cn to begin with condition i implies ccc and so every antichain is at most countable let w be a partition and n a number we shall define fn w so that the functions fn witness uniform weak distributivity we claim that there exists a finite set e w possibly empty such that there exists no nonempty finite set f w e with f cn if not then we can find an infinite sequence ek k of disjoint finite subsets of w producing an infinite antichain ek k 1 2 in cn we let fn w be such an e 6 now let wn n be a sequence of partitions since b is weakly distributive there exist finite sets en wn such that limn en 1 for each n let an en fn w by the definition of fn w we have an cn and hence limn an 0 it follows that limn fn w 1 lemma 3 2 4 p 259 if b is a uniformly weakly distributive ccc boolean algebra then b has the g property proof let fn be functions that witness the uniform weak distributiv ity for each n we let un a b a is disjoint from fn w for some partition w first we claim that n 1 un 0 if a un for each n and if wn are partitions such that a fn wn 0 then because limn fn wn 1 a must be 0 now let ak k be a sequence with limit 0 and let n be an integer there is a decreasing sequence bk k such that b 1 1 ak bk for each k and k 1 bk 0 let w be the partition bk 1 bk k 1 2 and let e fn w there is some k such that bk e 0 and hence ak un for all k k lemma 3 3 let b be a maharam algebra with a maharam submea sure m and assume that b satisfies the conditions of theorem 1 2 then m is uniformly exhaustive proof let cn n be a countable family with properties i and ii in order to verify that m is uniformly exhaustive it suffices to show that for every 0 there is some n such that a b m a cn if not let be a counterexample for each n we pick an cn with m an by ii limn an 0 since m is continuous we have limnm an 0 a contradiction now theorem 1 2 follows if b satisfies the conditions then by lemmas 3 1 3 2 and the balcar jech paza k theorem b carries a ma haram submeasure and by lemma 3 3 and the kalton roberts the orem b carries a measure having proved theorem 1 2 for theorem 1 3 it suffices to show that under the conditions of the theorem b is weakly distributive as b satisfies ccc it is enough to show that if for every k limn a k n 0 then there is a function n k such that limk a k n k 0 see 4 p 253 this diagonal property is verified using iii and ii 7 turning our attention to theorem 1 4 we will show that the con ditions of theorem 1 4 imply the conditions of theorem 1 2 let b be a weakly distributive boolean algebra and let cn n be a countable family that has properties i and ii of theorem 1 4 notice that if we replace each cn by the set x b y x y c 1 cn then the family still has properties i and ii thus we assume that c 1 c 2 and that each cn is upward closed the following lemma shows that cn n satisfies condition ii of theorem 1 2 lemma 3 4 if an cn for each n then lim supn an 0 proof let a lim supn an and assume that a 6 0 for each n and each k let bnk an 1 an k from ii it follows that bnk cn for all k we have a limn limk bnk and by weak distributivity there exists for each n some k n such that a limn bn k n since a 6 0 there exist some b 6 0 b a and some n such that b bn k n for all n n let n n be such that b cn since cn is upward closed we have bn k n cn a contradiction for theorem 1 7 let b be a boolean algebra that satisfies the conditions of theorem 1 7 by lemma 3 2 b has the g property and theorem 2 6 shows that b is a maharam algebra as long as it is ccc we use the following lemma lemma 3 5 3 if b is a uniformly weakly distributive boolean algebra then b satisfies ccc proof let b be the regular completion of b since b is dense in b every partition in b has a refinement in b and limits of sequences in b are the same in b as in b hence b is uniformly weakly distributive if b has a partition of size 1 then p 1 is a complete subalgebra of b and therefore it is uniformly weakly distributive by 3 p 1 is not uniformly weakly distributive and so b and hence b satisfies ccc hence b carries a maharam submeasure by the balcar jech paza k theorem lemma 3 6 let b be a maharam algebra with a maharam submea sure m and assume that b is concentrated then m is uniformly exhaustive 8 proof if m is not uniformly exhaustive then there exists an 0 such that for every n there is an antichain an of size 2 n with m a for all a an this contradicts the condition that there exists a sequence an n such that an an and limn an 0 this completes the proof of theorem 1 7 if b satisfies its condi tions then b carries a maharam submeasure by the balcar jech paza k theorem and by the kalton roberts theorem it carries a measure for theorem 1 8 we will show that if b satisfies the conditions of theorem 1 8 then it satisfies the conditions of theorem 1 2 let b be a weakly distributive boolean algebra and let f be a function acting on finite antichains witnessing that b is uniformly concentrated for each n we let cn a b a 6 f a for every antichain a of size 2 n if a is such that a cn for each n then there exist antichains an such that an 2 n and a f an since limn f an 0 we have a 0 and so n 1 cn b if an n is a sequence such that an cn for each n then there exist antichains an such that an 2 n and an f an hence limn an 0 finally every antichain in cn has fewer than 2 n elements if a is an antichain of size 2 n then f a cn and so a is not a subset of cn hence b satisfies the assumptions of theorem 1 2 4 odds and ends a boolean algebra b satisfies the bounded cc chain condition if b is the union of a countable family cn n such that for every n every antichain in cn has at most k n elements for some integer k n b satisfies the finite cc if b is the union of a countable family cn n such that for every n every antichain in cn if finite these conditions were explicitly stated in 7 the conditions in theorems 1 2 and 1 4 state that b is bounded cc but require that the cn have an additional property this is nec essary talagrand s result 16 yields a maharam algebra that is bounded cc but is not a measure algebra in contrast stevo todorce vic proved in 19 that a boolean algebra b is a maharam algebra if and only if it is weakly distributive and finite cc notice that if b carries a maharam submeasure m then b n 1 cn such that 9 cn n witnesses the finite cc and also has the additional properties from theorems 1 2 and 1 4 let cn a b m a 1 2 n as david fremlin pointed out if we drop weak distributivity in theorem 1 4 then we get a characterization of boolean algebras that carry a finitely additive measure theorem 4 1 a boolean algebra b carries a finitely additive mea sure if and only if b is the union of a countable family cn n such that for every n i every antichain in cn has at most k n elements and ii for every n and all a and b if a b cn then either a cn 1 or b cn 1 proof the condition is clearly necessary for the sufficiency we follow the construction in 1 p 75 first modify the cn so that each cn is upward closed and c 1 c 2 c 3 and let un b cn for each n for each number r 1 2 n 1 1 2 nk iwth n 1 nk let vr u 1 uk ui uni i 1 k and define m a inf r a vr the condition ii implies that for each a 1 2 n m a 1 2 n 1 where n is the least n such that a cn it follows that m a 0 whenever a 6 0 and m is a submeasure on b by i m is uniformly exhaustive and so by the kalton roberts theorem b carries a finitely additive measure theorems 1 7 and 1 8 state that measure algebras are characterized by being uniformly weakly distributive and concentrated resp weakly distributive and uniformly concentrated from theorem 1 7 and 2 it follows that it is consistent that b is a measure algebra if and only if it is ccc weakly distributive and concentrated on the other hand if a suslin tree exists then the corresponding suslin algebra b is ccc weakly distributive and concentrated and does not carry even a maharam submeasure proposition 4 2 let t be a suslin tree and b the corresponding complete boolean algebra then b is concentrated proof let an n be finite antichains in b an 2 n we may assume that an 1 for each n a routine argument using that t is a suslin tree shows that there exists a countable family of functions fk k n 1 an such that k 1 n 1 fk n 1 10 now let f n 1 an be such that for each n f n 6 fi n for all i 1 n we show that limn f n 0 let an f n and let a lim supn an for each k let bk n 1 fk n since an fk n 0 for all n k we have n k an bk 0 and it follows that a bk 0 hence a 0 in the proof of theorem 1 8 we showed that if b is uniformly con centrated then b is bounded cc it turns out that a weak version of uniformly concentrated is equivalent to the bounded cc and uni formly concentrated is equivalent to conditions i and ii of theorem 1 2 proposition 4 3 a a boolean algebra b is bounded cc if and only if there exists a function f such that for each finite antichain a f a a and if an n is a sequence of finite antichains of increasing size then lim infn f an 0 b a boolean algebra b is uniformly concentrated if and only if b is the union of a countable family cn n with c 1 c 2 such that for every n i every antichain in cn has fewer than 2 n elements and ii if an n is a sequence with an cn for each n then limn an 0 proof a first assume that b is bounded cc and let cn n be a witness we may assume that each cn is upward closed and that c 1 c 2 if a is a finite antichain let n be the least n such that a cn and let f a a a be such that a cn 1 hence for all n if f a cn then a cn now let an n be a sequence of finite antichains increasing in size and let an f an we claim that lim infn an 0 if not then there exist some a 6 0 and some k such that a an for all n k let n be such that a cn then an cn for all n k it follows that an cn for all n k and so cn has antichains of arbitrary size a contradiction conversely let f be a function that satisfies the condition if we let cn a b a 6 f a for every antichain of size n 1 then the same argument we used in the proof of theorem 1 8 shows that n 1 cn b and that every antichain in cn has at most n elements b for one direction see the proof of theorem 1 8 for the other direction given the cn we let f a a a be such that a cn 1 11 where n is the least n with a cn now if an 2 n then an 6 cn and so f an cn hence limn f an 0 weak distributivity has a formulation in terms of forcing a com plete ccc boolean algebra b is weakly distributive if and only if for every b name f for a function from to there exists a function g such that n n nf n g n the last formula is equivalent to limn f n g n 1 similarly b is concentrated if and only if for every b name f for a function from to there exists a function g such that g n 2 n for each n and n n nf n 6 g n the following result shows that the existence of a finitely additive measure does not imply that b is concentrated the cohen algebra carries a finitely additive measure but is not concentrated proposition 4 4 the cohen algebra is not concentrated proof we use this representation of the cohen algebra let p be the forcing where the forcing conditions are finite sequences p of integers such that p n 2 n for each n dom p we let f be the following name for a function from to for each n and each k 2 n let f n k p p n k now if g is such that g n 2 n for all n then for every condi tion p and every n there exist a stronger condition q and some n n such that q f n g n this shows that f is a counterexample maharam algebras have a characterization in terms of infinite games using 1 david fremlin proved in 5 that a strategic version of weak distributivity implies the existence of a maharam submeasure for boolean algebras that satisfy ccc see 4 p 261 for details in 3 it is shown that the strategic diagonal property implies ccc combining this with the proof of theorem 1 7 we obtain the following characterization of measure algebras let b be a complete boolean algebra and consider the infinite game g in which the nth move of player i is a b name f n for an integer 12 and the nth move of player ii is an integer g n thus i produces a b name f for a function from to and ii produces a function g player ii wins if n n n f n g n and f n 6 g n mod 2 n theorem 4 5 a complete boolean algebra b is a measure algebra if and only if player ii has a winning strategy in the game
