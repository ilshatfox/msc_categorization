on reconstruction of dynamic permeability and tortuosity from data at distinct frequencies miao jung yvonne ou department of mathematical sciences university of delaware newark de 19716 usa mou math udel edu abstract this article focuses on the mathematical problem of reconstructing the dynamic permeabil ity k and dynamic tortuosity of poroelastic composites from permeability data at different frequencies utilizing the analytic structure of the stieltjes function representation of k de rived by avellaneda and tortquato in 7 which is valid for all pore space geometry the in tegral representation formula irf for dynamic tortuosity is derived and its analytic structure exploited for reconstructing the function from a finite data set all information of pore space microstructure is contained in the measure of the irf the theory of multipoint pade approxi mates for stieltjes functions guarantees the existence of relaxation kernels that can approximate the dynamic permeability function and the dynamic tortuosity function with high accuracy in this paper a numerical algorithm is proposed for computing the relaxation time and the cor responding strength for each element in the relaxation kernels in the frequency domain this approximation can be regarded as approximating the stieltjes function by rational functions with simple poles and positive residues the main difference between this approach and the curve fitting approach is that the relaxation times and the strengths are computed from the partial fraction decomposition of the multipoint pade approximates which is the main subject of the proposed approximation scheme with the idea from dehomogenization we also established the exact relations between the moments of the positive measures in the irfs of permeability and tortuosity with two impor tant parameters in the theory of poroelasticity the infinite frequency tortuosity for the general case and the weighted volume to surface ratio for the jkd model which is regarded as a special case of the general model from these relations we suggest a new way for evalu ating these two microstructure dependent parameters from a finite data set of permeability at different frequencies without assuming any specific forms of the functions except the fact that they satisfies the irfs numerical results for jkd permeability and tortuosity are

pressible fluids that can flow through the pore structure this field was pioneered by maurice a biot who developed his theory of poroelasticity from the 1930 s through the 1960 s a sum mary of much of biot s work can be found in his 1956 and 1962 papers 10 11 12 biot theory uses linear elasticity to describe the solid portion of the medium often termed the skeleton or matrix linearized compressible fluid dynamics to describe the fluid portion and darcy s law to model the aggregate motion of the fluid through the matrix while it was originally developed to model fluid saturated rock and soil biot theory has also been used in underwa ter acoustics 13 36 37 and to describe wave propagation in in vivo bone 24 25 35 biot s equations have been validated mathematically through applying homogenization techniques by various authors e g 17 5 6 67 38 23 regularity of solutions to isotropic poroelastic equations has been studied in 60 biot theory predicts rich and complex wave phenomena within poroelastic materials three different types of waves appear fast p waves analogous to standard elastic p waves in which the fluid and matrix show little relative motion and typically compress or expand in phase with each other shear waves analogous to elastic s waves and slow p waves where the fluid expands while the solid contracts or vice versa the slow p waves exhibit substantial relative motion between the solid and fluid compared to waves of the other two types the viscosity of the fluid dissipates poroelastic waves as they propagate through the medium with the fast p and s waves being lightly damped and the slow p wave strongly damped the viscous dissipation also causes slight dispersion in the fast p and s waves and strong dispersion in the slow p wave a variety of different numerical approaches have been used to solve poroelastic equations carcione morency and santos provide a thorough review of the previous literature 18 the earliest numerical work in poroelasticity seems to be that of garg 33 using a finite difference method in 1 d finite difference and pseudospectral methods have continued to be popular since then with further work by mikhailenko 50 hassanzadeh 40 dai et al 26 and more recently chiavassa and lombard 22 among others finite element approaches began being used in the 1980 s with santos and oren a s work 58 being one of the first boundary ele ment methods have also been used such as in the work of attenborough berry and chen 4 spectral element methods have also been used in both the frequency domain 28 and the time domain 51 with the recent rise of discontinuous galerkin methods dg has been applied to poroelasticity in several works such as that of de la puente et al 27 a finite volume method solver for 2 d and 3 d biot s equations can be found in 45 and 46 there have also been semi analytical approaches to solving the poroelasticity equations such as that of detour nay and cheng 29 who analytically obtain a solution in the laplace transform domain but are forced to use an approximate inversion procedure to return to the time domain finally there has been significant work on inverse problems in poroelasticity for which various for ward solvers have been used 59 16 of particular note is the paper of buchanan gilbert and khashanah 15 who used the finite element method specifically the femlab software package to obtain time harmonic solutions for cancellous bone as part of an inversion scheme to estimate poroelastic material parameters and the later papers of buchanan and gilbert 14 where the authors instead used numerical contour integration of the green s function in 59 numerical results from biot s equations are compared with the experimental measurement of ultrasound propagation in cancellous bone the physical parameters involved in the drag force are the tortuosity and the permeability in the biot equations for wave propagation in poroelastic materials 10 11 a critical fre quency c is defined for frequency below c the pore fluid flow is laminar and the friction term which takes into account the viscous interaction between the solid matrix and pore fluid 2 is modeled by the product of friction constant and the difference between the fluid velocity and the solid velocity we refer to this set of equations as low frequency biot equations for fre quency higher than c the friction constant is multiplied by a frequency dependent function to correct for the departure from laminar flow this leads to a memory term in the time domain biot equations the exact form of the memory kernel is not known except for specific pore shapes such as parallel tubes 11 6 this set of equations are referred to as high frequency biot equations the need for quantifying the dissipation s dependance on frequency for more general pore space geometry prompted the work in the seminal paper 43 by johnson koplik and dashen jkd in which the theory of dynamic fluid permeabilitykd and dynamic tortuosity td was developed for describing the inertial coupling and viscous coupling between matrix solid and pore fluid using the causality argument they derived the necessary symmetries and ana lytic properties ofk and t when is extended to the complex values most importantly they postulated the simplest forms ofk and t which satisfy those properties these two functions contain a tunable parameter take into account of the dependence on pore space geometries however it is very difficult to measure and is usually calculated through the em pirical formula 54 2 k 0 4 where is the infinite frequency tortuosity k 0 the static permeability and the porosity the problem is that it is not clear how well this formula ap proximates and even if it does the measurement of is very difficult and is still an active research area 3 30 42 48 63 31 the biot jkd equations refer to the set of biot equations modified by the jkd theory in biot jkd equations no critical frequency is defined and the friction term the drag force is always a memory term due to the numerical complexity brought by the memory terms most time domain vs fre quency domain solvers in the literature consider low frequency biot s equations even though it is well known in geological and biological applications that low frequency biot equations underestimate wave dissipation when compared with experiments there have been a few papers which proposed different methods for handling the memory terms among them the most popular ones are the fractional derivative approach for biot jkd model which requires complicated quadrature rules 47 and the phenomenological one which proposed to approx imates the memory terms with sums of exponential decay kernels 64 19 the latter is more computationally efficient but it is not clear how the weights and decay rates of the exponential decay kernels can be found in a systematic way the aims of this paper are 1 to utilize the integral representation formula irf of dynamic permeability which is derived in 7 to develop a numerical scheme that can reconstruct the dynamic perme ability function from any finite set of data measured at different frequencies unlike the jkd model it does not impose any specific form on the permeability function 2 to use the proposed numerical scheme together with the relation between tortuosity and permeability to reconstruct the tortuosity function from the finite data set the weights and decay rates of the exponential decay kernel then come naturally along this process due to the mathematical structure of the tortuosity irf derived in this paper 3 to quantify how microstructure affects the tortuosity and other effective parameters rele vant to drag force which is known to be an important signaling mechanism for activating the cell process for bone remodeling 56 44 49 53 55 57 the paper is organized as follows in section 3 definition of permeability and its role in the poroelastic equations the mathematical tools essential to the derivation of the tortuosity irf and the inversion scheme are explained in section 4 the numerical scheme for reconstructing permeability functions from a finite data set is presented numerical results for the biot jkd 3 model which is regarded as a special case are demonstrated the proof that the jkd perme ability function indeed can be represented as an irf with a probability measure is also given there in section 5 an irf of the dynamic tortuosity function is derived with this irf we prove that the time domain dynamic tortuosity function can be approximated by a combina tion of the dirac function at t 0 and a sum of exponentially decay kernels whose rates and strengths can be computed from the proposed numerical scheme numerical results for the jkd tortuosity is demonstrated there in section 6 we present three exact vs approximated mathematical formulas which quantify how the geometry of pore space affects various effec tive poroelastic parameters through moments finally in section 7 we summarize the results and compare our exact formula for with an existing empirical formula also future work is pointed out there 3 mathematical background 3 1 permeability and tortuosity for a rigid porous medium filled with newtonian pore fluid with density f and dynamic viscosity a key effective property is the fluid permeability tensor k which is described by the so called darcy s law 6 43 7 62 u k p 1 where u is the averaged fluid velocity over a representative volume element rve of the porous medium and p the applied pressure gradient this is referred to as the static per meability if the applied pressure gradient is oscillatory with frequency then the induced averaged fluid velocity will also be oscillatory and proportional to p by u k p 2 where k is referred to as the dynamic permeability 43 7 k varies with because the viscous interaction between fluid and solid varies with frequency as indicated by the frequency dependent viscous skin depth 2 f for 6 0 the tortuosity tensor t is related to k by t i f k 1 i 1 note t has a pole at 0 3 as was mentioned in section 2 there are two different forms of drag forces in biot equations depending on whether it is below or above the critical frequency c f k 0 k 0 k 0 20 for a low frequency in the frequency domain the drag force is b fluid velocity relative to solid velocity with b 2 k 0 whereas for a high frequency the constant b is replaced by b f where im f 0 and re f 1 as 0 biot derived the exact expression of f for thin circular tubes in terms of zero order kelvin functions of the first kind 10 and assumed the same functional form for all other pore geometry by a heuristically defined correction constant in 43 the biot jkd equations are proposed by unifying the two types of friction terms in biot s equations with a frequency dependent function for isotropic poroelas tic materials based on physics based argument and exact calculation of parallel circular tubes johnson koplik and dashen postulated the isotropic dynamic tortuosity to be of the form td 1 i fk 0 1 i 4 2 k 2 0 f 2 2 4 4 with the tunable geometry dependent constant and 3 implies kd k 0 1 4 i 2 k 20 f 2 2 i k 0 f 5 where f is the dynamic viscosity of pore fluid the homogenization analysis in 6 and physical arguments in 43 shows that the perme ability in biot jkd equations for poroelastic materials is identical to that for porous media with a rigid matrix furthermore the permeability can be mathematically characterized as a functional of the solution to the unsteady stokes equation 7 v t p f 4 v v 0 e t in v 1 v 0 in v 1 v 0 on v 6 where e is an arbitrary unit vector if k is statistically isotropic v 0 a constant the kinetic vis cosity t the dirac delta function v 1 the region occupied by pore fluid and v is the interface between fluid phase and solid phase in the rve with periodic condition or statistically homo geneous in the random media setting on the outer boundary of rve as is indicated in 7 the results can be easily generalized to all statistically homogeneous anisotropic k however we assume k is isotropic in this paper for simplicity it is shown in 7 the solution v x t can be expressed as a sum of the normal modes n v x t v 0 n 1 bne t n n x 7 where n are the eigenfunctions of the stokes system 4 n qn n n and n 0 in v 1 n 0 on v 1 n n 1 8 0 1 2 and n as n n are the viscous relaxation times and 1 referred to as the principal viscous relaxation time the eigenfunctions are orthonormal in the sense 1 v 1 v 1 m x n x dx mn kronecker delta 9 and the bn in 7 bn 1 v 1 v 1 e n x dx 10 in 7 it is shown through the classical hodge decomposition argument that the infinite frequency tortuosity can be mathematically expressed as f n 1 b 2 n 1 11 this shows the microstructure information affects through the projection of the applied flow direction on the normal modes of the stokes equation in the pore space 3 2 darcy s laws in poroelastic equations and permeability irf the state variables for both biot and biot jkd equations are v solid velocity q fluid velocity relative to the solid and p pore pressure note that v and p have different meanings from be fore and will stay unchanged hereafter the stress velocity formulation of biot jkd equations 5 figure 1 cancellous bone m y ou and l cardoso 2012 in a plane strain case consists of t xx c u 11 xvx c u 13 zvz 1 m xqx zqz

inverse fourier transform of the following equation p k 1 q f i v s i f td q f i v s 18 where q v s p are fourier transforms of q v and p respectively the fourier transform we use here is f f f 1 2 0 f t ei t dt the real part of k 1 corresponds to the dissipation term and the imaginary part to the inertial term in the time domain where the drag force is expressed as a time convolution term 6 47 the complete form of any component of k for all is very difficult to compute for a given porous medium such as cancellous bone whose pore geometry is complicated see fig 1 hereafter we consider isotropic k and hence replace k with k it is pointed out in 43 that when and k are extended to the complex plane they are analytic in the upper half plane because of causality and have the symmetry property and k k where the bar means complex conjugation it is remarkable that in 7 k is derived rigorously for all pore space geometries as a stieltjes integral with distribution g that is nondecreasing right continuous g 0 for 0 and g 1 for 1 i e a probability distribution such that f k 0 dg 1 i with g n b 2 n n 1 b 2 n 19 the derivation is based on identifying the exact functional form ofk s in terms of the solution to the laplace transformed equations of 6 with the parameter s i 6 3 3 stieltjes functions and multipoint pade approximation the reconstruction scheme proposed in this paper is based on the properties of n point ap proximation for stieltjes functions two different but related definitions of stieltjes functions are widely used in the literature we adopt the following definition in this paper definition 3 1 a stieltjes function f z for z on the extended complex plane has the following form f z b a d t z t 20 where a b are extended real numbers and t is a bounded non decreasing real function a multipoint pade approximation of a function f is a rational function interpolating f at various points not necessarily distinct the following theorem theorem 1 on p 26 of 34 is the foundation of the reconstruction algorithm proposed in this paper and hence we state it here theorem 3 1 34 suppose f is a stieltjes function of the form in 20 let pn 1 z and qn z be polynomials of degree at most n 1 and n respectively satisfying the relations k 1 k 2 k 3 2 n f z qn z pn 1 z a z z x 1 z xk 1 z z 1 z z 1 z zk 2 z zk 2 f z qn z pn 1 z b z zn k 3 1 where a z b z are analytic in c a b b z bounded at x 1 xk 1 r a b z 1 zk 2 c r then pn 1 z qn z b a d t z t for some bounded non decreasing function t here n 1 n f z pn 1 z qn z is referred to as the 2 n point pade approximant for f and is unique 34 it has nice convergent properties in c a b as long as the interpolating points are of the types specified in the theorem above the significance of theorem 3 1 is that when the complex valued interpolating points appear in conjugate pairs the approximant of a stieltjes function can be expressed as n 1 n f z n k 1 rk z pk 21 with rk 0 and pk a b for k 1 n it will be made clear later in the paper that this property can be used for generating efficient quadrature rules for dealing with the memory term in the dynamic darcy s law 18 in time domain 4 reconstruction of dynamic permeability our experience with dehomogenization indicates that k can be reconstructed with a very good accuracy from partial data by exploring its mathematical structure as a stieltjes function 21 65 66 define a new variable s and a new function p s s i p s f k is 1 0 dg 1 s 1 0 d 1 s 22 1 s r s f k is sp s 1 0 dg 23 we summarize the definitions of auxiliary variables and auxiliary functions in table 1 it is clear that r in 23 is a stieltjes function with due to the irf of p s in 22 it is known that its pade approximants have accuracy through order property 8 and all the 7 s i 1 s k p s f k is r sp s table 1 auxiliary variables and functions for dynamic permeability k poles of the pade approximants are simple with positive residue in 1 1 on the com plex s plane 52 most importantly the multipoint pade approximants or rational inter polants with interpolation knots sk nk 1 with either sk 0 or conjugate complex numbers appearing in pairs has interlacing simple zeros and simple poles locating in the regions where p s is not analytic 61 suppose we have values of k j for different nonzero frequencies 1 2 m r this means the values of r for k i k c r k 1 m are known to generate the complex conjugated interpolating points at k we note that 23 im plies r 1 0 dg 1 0 dg r because g r hence the data of k at m different frequencies indeed provide 2 m data points for the reconstruction of r through this symmetry the 2 m point pade approximants are formulated as follows r j 1 0 dg j m 1 m r a 0 a 1 j am 1 m 1 j 1 b 1 j bm mj j 1 2 m 24 we know that the constant term in the denominator can be normalized to 1 and the unknowns a 0 am 1 b 1 bm can be assumed real valued because of 21 furthermore the mo ments of dg can be computed from partial fraction decomposition of it when lower frequency data points are used note that the first moment of dg is equal to fk 0 and hence the forma tion factor f can be recovered from the numerically estimated moments if k 0 and are known that is the tortuosity can be recovered from data of k at low frequencies if the porosity is known in terms of the partial fraction decomposition of m 1 m r m 1 m r m j 1 rj pj rj 0 0 pj 1 25 the approximation of dynamic permeability k can be expressed as k f m j 1 rj 1 i pk 26 therefore the permeability in time domain can be approximated as f 1 k t f m j 1 rj pj e t pj 27 4 1 formulation and algorithm for better conditioning of the inversion scheme the reconstruction is based on 38 rather than r 8 suppose we have values of k j k isj p sj for different nonzero real valued frequencies 1 2 m then we can generate another m interpolation points by using the symmetry of 19 for r f p sj k j k j k j f p sj j 1 2 m because of 25 and 26 we can approximate p s as p sj 1 0 dg 1 sj m 1 m p s a 0 a 1 sj am 1 sm 1 j 1 b 1 sj bmsmj j 1 2 2 m 28 and the moments of dg can be computed from partial fraction decomposition of the approxi mant when lower frequency data are used we know that the constant term in the denominator can be normalized to 1 because all the poles are simple and located in 1 1 given the data sj p sj sj 6 0 j 1 m let sj m sj p sj m p sj and pm p sm m 1 2 m then 28 leads to the linear system of equations ax d a 1 s 1 s 2 1 s m 1 1 p 1 s 1 p 1 s 2 1 p 1 s 31 p 1 sm 1 1 s 2 s 2 2 s m 1 2 p 2 s 2 p 2 s 2 2 p 2 s 32 p 2 sm 2 1 s 2 m s 2 2 m s m 1

approximants of p s constructed in this way have real valued simple poles pj with positive residues rj j 1 n we have m 1 m p s a 0 a 1 s am 1 sm 1 1 b 1 s bmsm m j 1 rj s pj and x r 2 m noting that we have 2 m real valued unknowns and 2 m complex valued data for the linear system with complex coefficients there are 4 m equations with real valued coef ficients for the 2 m real valued unknowns rather than solving the formal equations of ax d as in 65 66 in least square sense which requires formingatrar anda t iai we solve this system of equations as an overdetermined least square problem by the following algorithm 1 rescale each column aj j 1 2 m of a by c diag aj 12 2 m j 1 let ax ac c 1 x by 2 let b br bi d dr di 30 solve the overdetermined system b y d in the least square sense with

pade approximant retain only the negative poles in 1 c 1 1 p with positive weights and dis card the rest theoretically all the poles in step 4 should be in the range specified there numerically the ill posed nature of the inverse problem leads to poles outside the range suppose m poles are retained after discarding the spurious poles m m we reindex them and the corresponding residues to pj rj m j 1 the function p s is then approximated by p s pmest s m j 1 rj s pj m j 1 rj pj 1 s 1 pj 31 and the moments k k 0 1 2 by k 1 k 1 m j 1 rj pj k 1 32 in terms of the poles and residues in 31 the time

the general theory presented in 7 4 2 irf for jkd permeability since the jkd permeability in 5 was derived by a completely different approach from that in 7 we need to show kd indeed assumes a

because yrd iy k 0 as r 3 y and yrd iy 0 as r 3 y 0 by a general representation theorem in function theory 2 these three properties imply there exists a non decreasing function d u of bounded variation on 0 p such that rd p 0 d d u u for c 0 p 37 transforming 37 back to kd i we see that kd indeed can be represented as an irf with positive measure d d f kd p 0 d d u 1 i u 38 moreover the irf in 23 gives additional information in the sense that it characterizes d d u as udg u with dg being a probability measure to verify this we compute d d explicitly as follows since a function of bounded variation can only have jump discontinuities and is differen tiable almost everywhere d u must be continuous in the support of d u that corresponds to the branch cut of rd using the stieltjes

and dynamic tortu osity depend on both the frequency and the pore space geometry the fact that the integrands in the irfs are only functions of frequency implies that all the geometrical information must be encoded in the measures the analyticity of both functions at s 0 enable the calculation of moments in terms of the coefficients of taylor expansions there for example 22 implies 0 d fk 0 k 0 59 the relation between the permeability and the tortuosity leads to the following relation be tween the moments of d and d p d 0 d k j p 1 k d j d p 1 60 from 60 the infinite frequency can be expressed in terms of moments 0 d 2 0 d 1 d 61 for the jkd permeability and tortuosity the measure d d satisfies 0 d d 1 0 d d lim s 0 dd s 2 k 0 2 2 62 suppose we can reconstruct 0 d d and 0 d d from low frequency data of permeability k and that we know the porosity and pore fluid kinetic viscosity then we can recover from the fact that 0 d d k 0 because k 0 can be obtained easily through extrapo lation of low frequency data once is known 62 can be used to recover which is a weighted pore volume to surface ratio that provides a measure of the dynamically connected part of the pore region 7 we note that 62 implies the following for the jkd model 2 k 0 2 0 d d 2 k 0 1 d d 20 d d 1 63 formulas 59 61 and 63 show exactly how microstructural information affects the effec tive parameters and

11 e dmest for 4 180 khz r equally spaced m modified 7 conclusion in this paper we derived the integral representation formula irf for dynamic tortuosity t in general form we show that t can be written as the sum of a function with a simple pole at 0 and a stieltjes function utilizing the analytic structure of this irf and the irf of permeability k derived in 7 an algorithm based on multipoint pade approximation of stieltjes functions is proposed for constructing k and t from the values of permeability at district frequencies taking into account the symmetry of stieltjes functions only m differ ent frequencies instead of 2 m are needed for constructing the m 1 m approximant it is demonstrated that the moments of both the measures in the irfs of k and t can be estimated to high accuracy from low frequency data the capability of this algorithm for re covering the moments can be utilized to compute the inf tortuosity through 59 using the low frequency permeability data if the viscosity of pore fluid is known because k 0 can be approximated very well from pmest s furthermore if the jkd model is used the microstructure dependent parameter can be recovered by the formula in 63 it is interesting to note that the empirical formula for sug gested by jkd 54 is 2 k 0 4 comparing this with 63 which is exact this empirical formula corresponds to the assumption that 1 d d 20 d d 5 4 which is not always true and obvi ously not satisfied by the moments calculated in this paper we have also shown that the jkd permeabilitykd can indeed be represented by a prob ability measure in its irf as is predicted by the general result in 7 the results of numerical experiments conducted on the frequency ranges taken from the literature in biomechanics for bone 59 and seismology 47 are presented for the bandwidth spreading less than two others of magnitude the proposed algorithm with equally spacing interpolating points achieve approximates with high accuracy from the last two numerical examples we see that the approximation is of good accuracy away from the first interval the max relative error can be greatly improved by adding one sample point close to the lowest frequency to the equally spaced points this implies that the location of sample points play an important role in the approximation and will be the topic of future investigation another 22 way to handle wide frequency range can be to divide it into shorter intervals and do local approximation the advantage of our reconstruction scheme is two fold first of all it provides high accuracy interpolation of the permeability tortuosity data without assuming anything beyond the fact that they are related to stieltjes functions and hence is more general than the jkd model which assumes specific forms of the dynamic tortuosity functions secondly the time domain representation such as 54 provides an efficient way for numerically handling the memory terms that appears in the time domain numerical simulation for wave propagation in poroelastic materials acknowledgement this research is partially sponsored by arra nsf dms math biology grant 0920852 references 1 mark j
