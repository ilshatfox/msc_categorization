beyond dominated convergence newer methods of integration pat muldowney abstract lebesgue s dominated convergence theorem is a crucial pillar of modern analysis but there are certain areas of the subject where this theorem is deficient deeper criteria for convergence of integrals are described in this article 1 what is integration we learn calculus in secondary school first differentiation of functions and later integration as the inverse or opposite of differentiation the integral is the anti derivative or primitive function from which definite integrals can be easily deduced in more advanced mathematics courses we learn riemann s definition of definite integrals which enables us to integrate more functions the riemann method does not make use of differentiation it is similar to the ancient method of finding areas and volumes by exhaustion that is estimating the area or volume by dividing it up into pieces which are more easily estimated and then taking the aggregate of the pieces specialists in mathematical analysis go on from this to study the lebesgue method of integration why again one of the stock answers to this question is that the lebesgue method enables us to integrate functions which cannot be integrated by more familiar methods such as the calculus integral and the riemann integral the dirichlet function is sometimes mentioned in the unit interval 0 1 this function takes value one at the rational points and zero at the other points the dirichlet function is not the derivative of some other function so it cannot be integrated by the method we learn at school in calculus lessons 1 ar x iv 1 70 2 04 23 6 v 1 m at h h o 1 f eb 2 01 7 also it cannot be integrated by riemann s method but the lebesgue in tegral of the dirichlet function exists the definite integral of the dirichlet function on the unit interval is 0 but so what apart from some specialists and experts is there anybody else who has any real use for the dirichlet function and who really cares whether or not it is amenable to calculus it cannot be pictured as lines in a graph it does not have a straightforward formulation in polynomial trigonometric or exponential terms unlike the area and volume calculations of antiquity and unlike the calculus of newton and leibnitz which explained the world in mechanical terms what difference does the dirichlet function make to anyone outside the narrow and rarified world of a tiny number of people in pure mathematics the same can be said of many of the other arcane and exotic functions such as the devil s staircase invented during the long nineteenth century gestation of lebesgue integration measure theory and set theory such func tions have counter intuitive and challenging qualities that we can admire and wonder at but they were described by hermite and poincare as unwelcome monsters causing mayhem in the rich and fertile garden of mathematics does anyone believe that the difference between the lebesgue and the riemann integrals can have physical significance and that whether say an airplane would or would not fly could depend on this difference if such were claimed i should not care to fly in that plane richard w hamming 5 this critique is understandable but unhistorical by the early nineteenth century the rich and fertile garden was on the verge of becoming a barren and dangerous wilderness and not because of trespassing monster functions 2 monstrous functions in the tradition of newton and leibnitz fourier series representation of functions had opened up the analysis of wave motion crucial to an under standing of sound light electricity and so on but strange and paradoxical things could happen when the integral of a function was obtained by inte grating its fourier series term by term certain questions could no longer be avoided to what extent and under what conditions is a function iden tical to its corresponding fourier series representation when is the integral of a function equal to the series obtained by integrating the terms of the corresponding fourier series 2 this boils down to whether a convergent series of integrable functions has integrable limit and whether the integral of the limit is equal to the limit of the integrals whenever the latter limit exists such issues motivated decades of investigation of the notion of integra tion until a satisfactory resolution was found in the convergence theorems uniform monotone and dominated convergence of lesbesgue integration theory in particular the dominated convergence theorem tells us that if a sequence of integrable functions fj converges to f and if the sequence sat isfies fj g for all j where g is integrable then f is integrable and fj converges to f as j the integral here is the definite lebesgue integral on some domain but the theorem holds for functions which are integrable in the older and more familiar senses of riemann cauchy and newton leibnitz since broadly speaking functions which are integrable in the latter senses are a fortiori integrable in the lebesgue sense from this point onwards somebody not necessarily expert in lebesgue s integration who is contentedly doing some familiar integral operations and who encounters some issue of convergence such as term wise integration of a fourier series can proceed in safety if a dominant integrable function g can be found for the convergence this is the practical significance of lebesgue s theory it is a reason why it is safe to fly in airplanes so to speak it is why the fertile garden did not turn into a barren wilderness and the monster functions were in reality guard dogs that played their part in protecting the garden 3 a non monstrous function but is this the end of the story did lebesgue s 1901 and 1902 papers 12 13 give the last word on the subject here is a sequence of non monstrous functions formed by combining some familiar polynomial with trigonometric functions for j 2 3 4 let fj x 2 x sin 1 x 2 2 x cos 1 x 2 if 1 j x 1 and 0 if 0 x 1 j an impression of function fj can be obtained from figure 3 below which contains the graph of f x 2 x sin 1 x 2 2 x cos 1 x 2 for 0 x 1 figure 2 resembles figure 3 in the neighbourhood of x 0 the difference between the two is 2 x sinx 2 whose graph is in figure 1 but the values of the latter function are very small in the neighbourhood 3 of x 0 figure 1 demonstrates its visual insignificance so to speak note that the vertical scale of figure 1 is much more magnified than the vertical scales of figures 2 and 3 figure 4 is the graph of the primitive function or anti derivative of f which will play a big part in our discussion each fj has a single discontinuity at x 1 j but is differentiable at every other point each fj is integrable in the sense of riemann and lebesgue and the sequence fj is convergent at each x to f x 2 x sin 1 x 2 2 x cos 1 x 2 f 0 0 whose graph is figure 3 the limit function f has a single discontinuity from the right at x 0 and it has a primitive function f x x 2 sinx 2 x 0 f 0 0 figure 4 so in fact f has a definite integral f 1 f 0 sin 1 on the domain 0 1 provided the newton leibnitz definition of the integral is used but f is unbounded on 0 1 and therefore is not riemann integrable on 0 1 and though clearly non monstrous and understandable to a begin ning calculus student the function f is not lebesgue integrable see below for discussion of this point on the face of it this example indicates a step backwards as it were where the old school method of newton leibnitz is actually more effective than more modern methods lebesgue s theory of the integral threw up anomalies of this kind and accordingly investigation of the theory continued through the twentieth century to recapitulate lebesgue s dominated convergence theorem can be said to be the cutting edge of modern integration theory but it fails to capture the convergence of sequences such as fj and 1 0 fj x dx the graph in figure 3 suggests 2 x 2 as a conceivable candidate for dominating function g for the terms fj j 1 2 3 at least in a neighbourhood of the critical point x 0 but 2 x 2 is not integrable in a neighbourhood of 0 and it seems that the dominated convergence theorem is not applicable here this failure must sound some alarm bells because while many working mathematicians can get by without the lebesgue integral we cannot really do without convergence theorems which allow us for instance to perform routine operations on fourier series or more generally to safely find the integral of the limit of a sequence of integrable functions by taking the limit of the corresponding sequence of integrals the purpose of this essay is to dip into some aspects of modern integration theory in order to introduce theorems 1 2 and 3 below which are delicate 4 enough to deal with for instance the convergence of the functions fj above and their integrals while also covering the ground already captured by the convergence theorems of lebesgue s theory for ease of reference here again are the sequence fj and related functions j 1 2 3 f x 2 x sin 1 x 2 2 x cos 1 x 2 if 0 x 1 0 if x 0 1 fj x 2 x sin 1 x 2 2 x cos 1 x 2 if 1 j x 1 0 if 0 x 1 j 2 f x x 2 sin 1 x 2 if 0 x 1 0 if x 0 3 fj x x 2 sin 1 x 2 if 1 j x 1 0 if 0 x 1 j 4 figures 3 and 4 are respectively the graphs of the functions f and f the graphs of fj and fj are easily substituted just insert a horizontal line segment at height 0 from x 0 to x 1 j the function f has a single discontinuity at x 0 while f is continuous the reader should verify that f is differentiable including at the point x 0 from the right and that f 0 0 f 0 the fact that f x f x for x 0 is easily verified this establishes that f lim fj has a primitive or anti derivative and f is the calculus or newton indefinite integral of f also the calculus or newton definite integral on 0 1 is 1 0 f x dx f 1 f 0 sin 1 0 sin 1 for each j both fj and fj have a discontinuity at x 1 j but provided x 6 1 j we have f x fj x thus for each j fj is riemann and lebesgue integrable on 0 1 but not calculus or newton integrable on 0 1 however fj is calculus integrable on j 1 1 for each j and 1 0 fj x dx 1 1 j fj x dx f 1 f 1 j sin 1 1 j 2 sin j 2 5 provided we interpret 1 0 as a riemann or lebesgue integral thus as j 1 0 fj x dx 1 0 f x dx 5 provide we interpret the left hand integrals in the sense of riemann or lebesgue and the right hand one as a calculus or newton leibnitz inte gral unless we can interpret it in some other way 5 is deficient as it stands since we cannot ascribe the same meaning to the symbol 1 0 in the left and right hand terms in fact we will establish later that 5 is valid for an adapted 1 version of the riemann integral and that the convergence including integrability of the limit function f though unrelated to any kind of dominated convergence satisfies a new kind of riemann sum convergence criterion which goes beyond the lebesgue dominated convergence theorem to recapitulate for 0 x 1 the function fj is bounded and continuous except for a discontinuity at x j 1 also it is differentiable except at x j 1 it has anti derivative fj x except at x j 1 by familiar standard results fj is riemann integrable and lebesgue in tegrable on domain 0 1 but as discussed above its limit function f is not lebesgue or riemann integrable there are theorems which tell us when to expect lebesgue integrability of the limit function of lebesgue integrable functions if the convergence of the functions fj to the function f is uniform monotone or dominated by a lebesgue integrable function then lebesgue integrability of the functions fj implies lebesgue integrability of their limit function f with lim j 1 0 fj x dx 1 0 lim j fj x dx 1 0 f x dx inspection of the graphs indicates that convergence of functions fj is not uniform monotone or dominated and even though each fj is lebesgue integrable the limit function f is not lebesgue integrable as demonstrated below is this a big problem for the garden of mathematics or is it just a mi nor incursion by not a monster but an atypical creature which is easily contained this article attempts to provide some perspective 1 that is the riemann complete integral also known as the generalized riemann or henstock kurzweil integral 6 figure 1 2 x sinx 2 figure 2 2 x 1 cosx 2 figure 3 2 x sinx 2 2 x 1 cosx 2 figure 4 x 2 sinx 2 7 the names of denjoy perron kolmogorov and others are associated with twentieth century efforts 4 to pursue the implications of problems such as the convergence of functions fj and their integrals this article will examine the riemann sum approach of r henstock and j kurzweil 4 riemann complete integration kurzweil came to this subject through his investigations of differential equa tions henstock was interested in convergence issues in integration inde pendently each of them focussed on careful construction of riemann sums for integrands f here is a broad outline of riemann sum construction a partition p of a domain such as 0 1 is a set of points u 0 u 1 u 2 un 1 identify p with the corresponding set of disjoint intervals ii p u 0 u 1 u 1 u 2 u 2 u 3 un 1 un ii i 1 2 n for each ii p let ii denote the length ui ui 1 of ii given a function f x defined for x 0 1 evaluation points xi are selected for the intervals ii p in accordance with certain rules such as ui 1 xi ui and then a riemann sum for f is n i 1 f xi ii or more briefly p f x i the integral 1 0 f x dx of f on the domain 0 1 denoted by exists if satisfies a condition which is broadly of the following form given 0 partitions p can be chosen such that n i 1 f xi ii for specified choices of xi and ii 1 i n 6 this inequality is reminiscent of the riemann integral of f but it is not the full definition that is required here there must be some rule sometimes called a gauge for selecting the elements xi ii corresponding to the partition p ii or xi ii that can be admitted in the inequality for riemann integration the rule is that given 0 there exists a constant 0 such that for every partition p xi ii for which ii 8 ui ui 1 and ui 1 xi ui for each ii p the above 2 inequality 6 holds denote such a rule by and denote a partition p which satisfies an appropriate instance of the rule by p an integral constructed from such a rule can be identified by notation then the definition of the integral 1 0 f x dx is as follows there is a number for which given any 0 there exists a corresponding 3 instance of such that every partition p satisfies p f x i 7 we will omit the in and allow the context to demonstrate which version of the integral is being discussed while the riemann sum rule for ordinary riemann integration is i the primary innovations of kurzweil and henstock were 1 to replace selection of intervals ii by selection of linked pairs xi ii in constructing riemann sums 4 and 2 to replace the constant by variable x 0 where x xi is the evaluation point in the term f xi ii of the riemann sum in 7 to distinguish this from the riemann integral call it 5 the riemann complete integral clearly every riemann integrable function is also integrable in the riemann complete sense a stieltjes type definition of the integral of a function f can be expressed as follows suppose f x and g x are point functions defined on the domain 0 1 the riemann stieltjes integral of f with respect to g is got by replacing the length function i by the increment function g i g ui g ui 1 in the above definitions a standard result is that if f is continuous and g is monotone or has bounded variation then the riemann stieltjes integral 1 0 f x dg exists if the constant 0 in the definition is replaced by the function x 0 of the riemann complete construction call the resulting integral the stieltjes complete integral of f with respect to g 2 if f is continuous on 0 1 then its riemann integral exists there 3 for the ordinary riemann integral read there exists a corresponding number 0 4 the familiar condition ui 1 xi xi is sometimes altered also the new approach often gives priority to the evaluation points xi and then it can be a more subtle and difficult task to determine the linked partitioning elements ii see 9 and 14 5 it is also called the henstock kurzweil integral generalized riemann integral and gauge integral 9 to see how the riemann complete integral matches the calculus or new ton leibnitz integral suppose a point function f x has an anti derivative or primitive function f x for 0 x 1 so its definite integral in the new ton leibnitz sense is f 1 f 0 proceeding as follows it is easy to deduce that f is riemann complete integrable if p is a partition of 0 1 with partition points ui 0 u 0 u 1 un 1 and if ui 1 xi ui then p f x i n i 1 f xi ui ui 1 n i 1 f xi xi ui 1 f xi ui xi f 1 f 0 n i 1 f ui f ui 1 n i 1 f xi f ui 1 f ui f xi let 0 be given then for each x 0 x 1 there exists a number x 0 such that for x a x f x f a x a f x 8 now choose a partition p so that each term f xi ui ui 1 satisfies xi ui 1 xi ui xi xi the existence of such partitions is a consequence of the heine borel theorem for such a partition 8 implies f xi f ui 1 f xi x ui 1 xi ui 1 9 f ui f xi f xi ui xi ui xi 10 with corresponding inequalities for x 0 and x 1 writing f 1 f 0 and r p f x i r n i 1 f ui f xi f xi f ui 1 n i 1 f xi xi ui 1 f xi ui xi n i 1 f xi f ui 1 f xi xi ui 1 10 f ui f xi f xi ui xi n i 1 xi ui 1 ui xi n i 1 xi ui 1 ui xi thus the riemann complete integral of f exists and equals the newton leibnitz definite integral f 1 f 0 in the case that f is given by 1 while the newton leibnitz and riemann complete integrals exist it has been asserted above that the lesbesgue inte gral does not exist 6 this assertion remains to be demonstrated the definition of the lebesgue integral of a function can be addressed in various equivalent ways e g 18 for instance given a real valued measur able function f defined on an arbitrary measurable space s with measure defined on the family of measurable subsets of s 15 shows how to define the lebesgue integral of f on s as a riemann stieltjes integral in r the set of real numbers in fact writing g x f 1 x the lebesgue integral s f d is the riemann stieltjes integral f dg if s r and is lebesgue measure in r and if the lebesgue integral of f exists then the riemann complete integral of f exists and the two integrals are equal every lebesgue integrable function is integrable in the riemann complete sense see 14 a key point is that the lebesgue integral is an absolute integral while the riemann complete is non absolute writing f x f x if f x 0 with f x 0 otherwise and f x f x f x absolute integrability implies that f is lebesgue integrable if and only if both f and f are lebesgue integrable 7 we use this point to demonstrate that the function f defined by 1 is not lebesgue integrable with that in mind figure 3 provides an indication of how the function f defined by 1 fails to be lebesgue integrable while 6 in that case the riemann integral of f does not exist either 7 this restriction does not apply to the riemann complete integral of f which does not require the riemann complete integrability of f and f 11 its riemann complete integral exists in fact figure 3 shows that in neighbourhoods of x 0 the graph of f oscillates increasingly rapidly in positive f above the x axis loops and negative f below the x axis loops whose amplitude or height depth increases without limit as x 0 this creates the suspicion or expectation that the sum of areas of the positive loops diverges to while the sum of areas of the negative loops diverges to but if instead of treating positive and negative loops separately we add up their areas in their natural sequence then positive and negative areas will tend to cancel each other out and the resulting sequence of net values may converge 8 the latter is what happens in the riemann sum construction of the riemann complete integral of f the following discussion seeks to add substance to these speculations in any interval not including zero but with small values of x figure 1 shows that the contribution from the term 2 x sinx 2 to the area under the graph of f is vanishingly small in neighbourhoods of x 0 while the corresponding contribution from the term 2 x 1 cosx 2 in f is relatively large therefore disregarding the term 2 x sinx 2 the zeros of 1 can for present purposes be estimated approximately as x 2 2 n 1 as x 0 or integer n accordingly we may estimate that for large even values of n 2 2 n 1 2 2 n 3 f x dx is approximately 2 1 2 n 1 1 2 n 3 while for large and odd values of n 2 2 n 1 2 2 n 3 f x dx is approximately 2 1 2 n 1 1 2 n 3 writing an 2 1 2 n 1 1 2 n 3 8 for example with bi 1 ii 1 the series i 1 bi converges but the series consisting of only the positive terms or only negative terms diverges so i 1 bi diverges 12 each of the two series a 2 a 4 a 6 a 1 a 3 a 5 diverges so it is clear that f is not lebesgue integrable in 0 1 but it is easy to see that the series a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 is non absolutely convergent even if we did not already know from existence of the primitive function f x for 0 x 1 that f is riemann complete integrable this is because the riemann complete convergence is obtained from the cancellation effects produced by successively summing the positive and neg ative parts in their natural sequence we can ensure this by choosing x as follows when x lies between adjacent roots 2 2 n 1 and 2 2 n 3 let x min x 2 2 n 3 2 2 n 1 x and if x is one of the roots 2 2 n 1 take x min 2 2 n 1 2 2 n 1 2 2 n 3 and when x 0 let 0 0 be arbitrary any partition corresponding to this definition of x 0 x 1 will contain a term with f 0 0 and the terms for non zero x will each contain an arbitrarily close estimate of the area of the corresponding positive or negative loop in figure 3 this provides the required cancellation and convergence of riemann sums since the alternating loops are monotone decreasing in area as x approaches 0 in the case of the lebesgue integral this cancellation effect is absent and convergence fails this establishes that just as there are lebesgue integrable functions that are not riemann integrable there are riemann complete integrable functions that are not lebesgue integrable 13 5 convergence criteria anybody experienced in the theory of integration will be aware that most of the preceding discussion covers fairly well worn ground which has already been worked through in many excellent publications such as 2 but at the outset of this article it was stated that while lebesgue s dom inated convergence theorem is a crucial pillar of modern analysis there are certain areas of the subject where this theorem is deficient the sequence fj of 2 demonstrates that the dominated convergence theorem provides no illumination in this particular instance of converging non absolute inte grals this section addresses the deficit there are convergence conditions and criteria which encompass and sur pass the dominated convergence monotone and uniform convergence theo rems of standard integration theory these are the convergence criteria of theorems 1 2 and 3 below they are valid for riemann complete integrals which include integrals of the newton leibnitz riemann and lebesgue kinds measurability of the integrand functions is not assumed theorem 1 suppose fj is integrable on 0 1 and fj x converges to g x for x 0 1 suppose given arbitrary 0 there exist a number 1 and for x 0 1 a gauge x and integers p p x depending on so that for every partition ii of 0 1 with linked elements xi ii satisfying ii xi i 1 n the condition 1 n i 1 fj xi xi ii holds for all choices of j j xi p xi i 1 n in the riemann sum then the limit function g x is integrable on 0 1 with 1 0 g x dx 1 theorem 2 suppose fj is integrable on 0 1 and fj x converges to g x for x 0 1 suppose given arbitrary 0 there exist a number 2 and a positive integer q q depending only on so that for every partition ii of 0 1 with linked elements xi ii satisfying ii xi i 1 n the condition 2 n i 1 fj xi ii holds for every choice of j q with j constant for each term of the rie mann sum then 1 0 fj x dx converges as j 14 theorems 1 and 2 can be expressed in converse form see 14 so they are criteria for their respective conclusions apart from the opening sentence of each they apply independently of each other in the sense that either one of them may hold for particular integrands while the other one does not hold theorem 3 if both of theorems 1 and 2 hold so both of 1 0 g and limj 1 0 fj exist then 1 0 g x dx lim j 1 0 fj x dx if and only if 1 2 for anybody more familiar with the classical integration theorems on passage to a limit these theorems or criteria may appear somewhat indigestible at first sight their starting point is that a convergent sequence of functions fj is given these function are assumed to be riemann complete integrable which is a weaker assumption than lebesgue integrability there is no assumption of properties like continuity or measurability to answer questions about convergence of the corresponding sequence of riemann complete integrals and about the riemann complete integrability of the limit function from previous experience of integration we might be led to expect some condition not about riemann sums but only about the functions fj such as monotonicity domination by a fixed integrable function g or the like but nothing like this appears in the above convergence criteria instead we have various statements about riemann sums however setting aside for a moment the conception of integral as prim itive function or anti derivative the original and more durable meaning of integral involves slicing up partitioning followed by summation followed by taking a limit of the sums from this perspective it may be less of a surprise that riemann sums appear in the formulation of conditions for limits of integrals since riemann sums are central to the concept of integral consider theorem 1 given integrability of the terms fj in the sequence this theorem addresses the integrability of the limit function f which essen tially involves the question of convergence of riemann sums f x i to make an initial stab at this question we might consider sequences of riemann sums fj x i j 1 2 3 we know that for each x the sequence of values fj x converges to f x as j we also know that for 15 each j riemann sums of the form fj x i converge to the integral of fj can we somehow put these two facts together to deduce as an immediate consequence convergence of riemann sums f x i to the integral of f of course we know that the answer to this is no the answer is yes if the terms fj satisfy some conditions such as fj g where g is integrable but if we want a condition expressed in the form of a condition on riemann sums clearly something more delicate than convergence of fj x i is required for instance with 0 given the condition we need is not that for all j greater than some j 0 j 0 every riemann sum fj x i will be contained within some ball b of the form this is too crude for our purpose all it says is that fj is integrable which we already know the convergence of fj x to f x may be very fast at some points x and very slow at other points x this behaviour is provided for in theorem 1 by choosing not j 0 j 0 but j 0 j 0 x different for each x this formulation is sufficient and necessary for integrability of the limit function f once this point is established the criteria of theorems 2 and 3 are fairly obvious and less subtle but are these conditions of theorems 1 2 and 3 workable in the way that the dominated convergence condition fj g is after all riemann sums are fine for defining the meaning of the integral of a function but when we actually want to find the value of an integral we do not typically work with riemann sums instead we revert to the integral as primitive or anti derivative using the substitution method or integration by parts or we use some less direct method such as solving a related differential equation or a myriad of other 9 ad hoc methods to respond to such questions and to demonstrate that riemann sums can actually be of use here we can as an example take the sequence fj defined in 2 remember for each j the function fj is riemann integrable and lebesgue integrable but not newton leibnitz integrable and their limit function f is newton leibnitz integrable but not riemann or lebesgue in tegrable for each j fj is riemann complete integrable 10 this discussion 9 which is not to say that riemann sums are merely a device of fundamental theory and nothing else versions of them have had other uses such as the ancient techniques of quadrature or computer programs for estimating numerical values of an integral simp son s rule is another example 10 as is f from earlier discussion but for present purposes we wish to deduce riemann complete integrability of f from theorem 1 16 of the convergence criteria of theorems 1 2 and 3 is set in the context of riemann complete integrability the subject of the first criterion is the riemann complete integrability of the limit function f and it is established by examining riemann sums of the form n i 1 fj xi x ii or n i 1 fj xi x ui ui 1 we already know by various means including a direct investigation of the riemann sums f x i that f x is riemann complete integrable on 0 1 the function f x is the limit of functions fj x is it possible to confirm further the integrability of f by direct examination not just of f x i but of riemann sums fj x x i involving functions fj instead of f where the factor fj in the sum has variable index j j x depending on the element x of the division d x i used to construct the riemann sum this is the essence of theorem 1 and according to theorem 1 the answer to this question should be yes given 0 and with a suitable gauge x provided factors fj x x are chosen appropriately we should be able to demonstrate that the value of each corresponding riemann sum fj x x i will lie within some ball b of radius where is arbitrarily small since we are already convinced of the integrability of f in this case what we are really trying to do here is to get a sense of the behaviour of sums fj x x i so given the integrability of f write 1 0 1 f x dx and choose a gauge so that for every fine partition xi ii of 0 1 1 n i 1 f xi ii or n i 1 f xi ii b 1 the ball with centre 1 and radius consider any one of these riemann sums n i 1 f xi ii corresponding to a particular fine partition with xi ii i 1 n for each x choose r x 1 x so r xi 1 xi for each i then by definition of fj if j j x r x fj x fj x x f x 17 so for all choices j xi r xi r xi n i 1 fj xi xi ii n i 1 f xi ii b 1 as required by theorem 1 in general the convenient equation fj x fj x x f x cannot be appealed to but if with suitable choices of j j x the differences fj x f x fj x x f x can make sufficiently small contributions to the riemann sum then it may be plausible that n i 1 fj x xi ii b implies n i 1 f xi ii b so f is integrable this is the intuitive content of theorem 1 now to theorem 2 the preceding remarks are concerned with the in tegrability of limj fj the fundamental assumption is that each function fj in the sequence fj is integrable in the case of our example 2 the anti derivatives 4 are the sequence fj giving a sequence of integrals 0 1 fj x dx fj 1 fj j 1 sin 1 fj j 1 which can be denoted by j note that continuity of f implies j 0 as j in this case it is already clear that the sequence of integrals 0 1 fj x dx converges as j the limit being in this case sin 1 what we want is confirmation including intuitive confirmation that theorem 2 actually works the convergence of a sequence of integrals is the subject of theorem 2 and it is again expressed in terms of riemann sums the criterion implies that with arbitrarily small 0 given there is a ball b 2 with centre 2 and radius and a corresponding integer q depending only on so that for each j q q a gauge j x 0 can be found such that for every j fine partition of 0 1 the corresponding riemann sum n i 1 fj xi ii is contained in b 2 so for every j fine xi ii 2 n i 1 fj xi ii 18 whenever j q unlike theorem 1 here j is the same for each term of any particular riemann sum again this is easy to demonstrate since we already know in this case that the integrals 0 1 fj x dx converge to the value sin 1 as j just take 2 sin 1 lim j g 1 g j 1 0 1 fj x dx and choose q so that j q implies 2 0 1 fj x dx for each j q choose a gauge j x 0 x 1 so that for any j fine partition xi ii of 0 1 0 1 fj x dx n i 1 fj xi ii then by the triangle inequality 2 n i 1 fj xi ii 2 or n i 1 fj xi ii b 2 2 for all j q q and all j fine partitions of 0 1 in other words the criterion of theorem 2 confirms the convergence of the sequence of integrals 0 1 fj x dx and this demonstration illustrates the intuitive content of theorem 2 finally the question arises whether the integral of the limit 0 1 lim j fj x dx equals the limit of the integrals lim j 0 1 fj x dx for the sequence fj of 2 we already know by direct evaluation that these two quantities have the same value namely sin 1 this agrees with the cri terion of theorem 3 which requires that 1 and 2 have the same value in this case 1 sin 1 2 so the intuitive content of theorem 3 is clear in the context of this example 19 6 conclusion so does it really matter whether aviation designers work out their aerody namic equations using old fashioned riemann integrals or the latest fancy lebesgue integrals probably not much but it matters a lot if the value 22 7 for were hard wired into every computer in the world or if the wrong value for elasticity of o rings at freezing temperature was used in space shuttle design and it certainly matters whether our aviation designers make tricky unjustifi able calculations involving for instance term by term integration of fourier series it is thanks to the intellectual diligence of the nineteenth century not to mention its monster functions that we have the dominated convergence theorem to keep the garden of mathematics safe and fertile and indeed to keep airplanes flying safely but do we really need anything more than the dominated convergence theorem for absolutely convergent integrals why bring up the convergence criteria of theorems 1 2 and 3 is the sequence fj described in 2 above just an exceptional one off or is it representative of something more significant if the latter where are all these non absolute integrals in fact they are very widespread modern stochastic calculus 16 17 is based on integrals for which absolute convergence fails but which may converge weakly or in some cases non absolutely these are described in 14 15 a very significant formulation of quantum mechanics is in terms of path integrals 3 which also fail to converge absolutely famously the dominated convergence theorem does not work for these integrals and as described in 14 the non absolute convergence criteria must be invoked does anyone believe i would not care to fly in that plane a healthy scepticism must be welcomed but what is certain is that while integration is central to mathematical analysis there are no certain and definite ways of tackling any problem of integration and even a beginning student has to exercise imagination and ingenuity from the ancient methods of quadrature to the methods of newton leibnitz cauchy
