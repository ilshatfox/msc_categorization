product gauges for product domains pat muldowney abstract in generalized riemann integration or henstock kurzweil integra tion the formation of the partitions used in riemann sum construction is regulated by rules known as gauges for instance if i is a one dimensional real interval in a partition of the domain of integration a term f x i of a riemann sum must satisfy a condition or rule i x where x is a positive function or gauge defined for points x of the domain this article examines gauges for multi dimensional domains t where t can be infinite and where itself can be an infinite dimensional cartesian product 1 introduction product domains are a common theme throughout 6 along with their gauges and integrals the products involved are essentially r r r finitely or infinitely the product element is r but other one dimensional real intervals can easily be substituted in fact any domain which lends itself to complete integral construction can be used as a component of a product space for formation of complete integra tion in the latter for instance product spaces can themselves be component spaces of product spaces so instead of r r r we could have r r 3 r 2 the latter of course is essentially the same as r r r r 6 what is the point of restructuring this product as r r 3 r 2 this article addresses this and similar issues the main point of the article is how to construct gauges for structured product domains along the way it is helpful to take a close look at the proof of theorem 4 divisibility theorem in 6 2 what is three dimensional brownian motion in 6 a sample space rt usually with t denoting an interval of time such as 0 is used to represent stochastic processes xt as in xt xt rt fxt a sample path xt then consists of real numbers x t or xt for 0 t xt x t 0 t xt 0 t xt 0 t 1 ar x iv 1 80 1 04 97 0 v 1 m at h c a 6 d ec 2 01 7 for example a brownian motion process is represented as xt xt rt g where the distribution function g i n is defined on cells i n rt in this case the variable or outcome at time t is x t where the latter denotes the displacement in one dimension of the brownian particle from the point of origin of the particle at time t 0 so x 0 0 is the origin or starting point of the particle and x t is the distance at later time t of the particle from the origin this distance is unpre dictable and indefinite but is assumed to follow some rule of normal distribution so it is observable in the sense used in 6 in fact x t is a possible outcome of a random variable xt or x t in other words x t is a sample value of the observable or random vari able x t and x x t t t is a sample path of the process joint observable joint random variable x x t t t the collection xt x of such xt or x t subject to a joint probability distribution g i n p x t i t t n gives the brownian process xt xt rt fxt as it stands however this mathematical formulation describes the random particle in one direction only whereas in reality such a particle is moving randomly in three dimensions not one example 1 in order to have a mathematical representation of brownian par ticle motion in three dimensions the following scheme can be used suppose the motion is in mutually perpendicular spatial directions s 1 s 2 s 3 that is a horizontal dimension a vertical dimension and a third dimension of depth and suppose the origin of the motion at time t 0 is 0 0 0 x 1 0 x 2 0 x 3 0 0 0 0 or x 1 0 x 2 0 x 3 0 0 0 0 likewise at time t 0 the particle displacement x s t in each of the three dimensions s 1 2 3 is x 1 t x 2 t x 3 t x s t s 1 2 3 0 t xst s 1 2 3 0 t with xst x s t xst g for s 1 2 3 0 t where sample space r and distribution function g satisfies among other properties g ist p xst ist for each cell ist in r the probability being given by the normal curve with mean zero and variance t for s 1 2 3 and 0 t 2 three dimensional brownian motion is not adequately described in example 1 above there are some further features which should be taken into account for instance the actual probabilities governing the process have been left un specified above at time t a brownian particle is located at position x t xt x 1 t x 2 t x 3 t x 1 t x 2 t x 3 t r 3 for times tj 0 t 0 t 1 t 2 tn 1 tn denote position by x tj xj x 1 tj x 2 tj x 3 tj x 1 j x 2 j x 3 j xij i 1 2 3 r 3 let i i 1 i 2 i 3 denote cells in r 3 where each ii i 1 2 3 is a cell in r for 1 j n let ij i 1 j i 2 j i 3 j for the brownian particle moving in three dimensions the joint event ij 1 j n denotes the possibility that the particle position xj at times tj is in ij so xij iij i 1 2 3 j 1 2 n the next step is to formulate a probability distribution or probability values for the joint event ij 1 j n in other words the probabilities p xj ij 1 j n p xij iij i 1 2 3 1 j n the conditions bm 1 to bm 7 6 pages 305 306 are applicable to the incre ments xij xi j 1 for 1 j n and for i 1 2 3 even though the increments are now expressed in all three dimensions of physical space rather than the one dimensional simplification of 6 in particular for any fixed j or tj the increments x 1 j x 1 j 1 x 2 j x 2 j 1 x 3 j x 3 j 1 in each of the three physical dimensions are each normally distributed random variables statistically independent of each other and of the other increments at other times tj 6 tj thus using the same reasoning as in the one dimensional case in 6 and writing i i 1 in the probability distribution function g for the three dimensional brownian motion is g i p xj ij 1 j n 3 i 1 n j 1 iij xij xi j 1 22 tj tj 1 dxij 2 tj tj 1 1 this expression is a three dimensional analogue of the one dimensional con struction in section 6 8 pages 284 288 of 6 remember as discussed in pages 87 88 of 6 a sample path xt can be thought of as a displacement time graph or as a point of an infinite dimensional cartesian product space rt but dimension in three dimensional analogue 3 above refers not to this issue but to the difference between r in rt and r 3 in r 3 t in other words it relates to the difference between xj xj 1 and xij xi j 1 i 1 2 3 the analysis of one dimensional brownian motion xt in 6 used the stochas tic process defined in the complete sense xt xt rt g with distribution function g defined in section 6 8 of 6 in the above discussion some of the el ements of a mathematical representation of three dimensional brownian motion have been introduced in particular a function xt which specifies the position in three dimensional space at each time t of a brownian particle and a new version of a probability function g i in 1 the question then arises whether it is possible to build on these elements that is xt and g i to form a complete stochastic process xt xt g where the sample space is the set r 3 t of all xt to achieve this objective it is necessary to establish that a complete integra tion system of gauge constrained point cell elements x i can be constructed in the domain r 3 t in accordance with axioms ds 1 to ds 8 of section 4 1 in 6 and in particular to establish existence of gauge constrained divisions of domain r 3 t as in theorem 4 pages 121 124 of 6 to prepare the ground for this task some motivational examples follow 3 a structured cartesian product space example 2 here is an example of multi dimensional random variation which involves measurements which depend on parameters other than time t and loca tion in three dimensional space suppose a single experiment on a moving object involves multiple measurements with unpredictable outcomes as follows 1 spatial orientation o of the object given by two angles measured in radians giving unpredictable outcomes xo a 1 a 2 where 0 x a 1 o x 1 o 2 0 x a 2 o x 2 o 2 or xi o s 0 2 i 1 2 2 location l of the object in 3 dimensional space given by three distance values which measure in centimetres say the co ordinates of the location relative to some point of origin 0 0 0 giving x di l xi l i 1 2 3 where xi l r for i 1 2 3 3 energy value of the object measured in joules say giving unpredictable outcome x e xe where xe 0 or xe r 4 to summarize write xo xi o i 1 2 xl xi l 1 1 2 3 xe xe x xo xl xe where xi o s xi l r for each i and xe r if appropriate distribution functions exist this scenario can be formulated in complete terms or riemann observable terms i e as in 6 as follows if outcomes xe measurement of energy have a probability distribution fxe then xe xe r fxe is a basic observable if joint outcomes xl xi l i 1 2 3 have a joint probability distribution fxl then xl xl r 3 fxl is a joint basic observable if joint outcomes xo xi o i 1 2 have a joint probability distribution fxo then xo xo s 2 fxo is a joint basic observable however the experiment consists of a single joint measurement of each of the variables this suggests a single joint observable x involving all of the parameters of the experiment let mo 1 2 ml 1 2 3 me 1 m mo ml me xm x 1 o x 2 o x 1 l x 2 l x 3 l xe s s r r r r xm xm fxm 2 assuming a joint distribution function fxm exists defined on cells i i m i mo i ml i me of sample space s s r r r r the symbols variously denoted by m are labels corresponding to sets of dimen sions n in the theory formulated in 6 for domain rt the elements in 2 may appear somewhat over structured for instance xm has three components consisting respectively of two three and one joint measurements it would be reasonable and no doubt simpler to treat the experiment as a whole as consisting of six joint measurements in unstructured sample space s s r r r r or simply r 6 with appropriate restrictions in the dis tribution functions disregarding the 2 3 1 structure corresponding to measure ment of angles distances and energy respectively however the more structured approach will be seen in due course to have some advantages in terms of the riemann observable or complete theory in 6 the joint basic observable xm cannot be understood as a random variable but a contin gent observable f xm may under certain circumstances qualify as a random variable to illustrate suppose the value of some imagined physical property call it the bentropia of the system is measured as a real number b obtained by means of a deterministic calculation f on the orientation angles the displacement distances and the energy of the object b f xm f x 1 o x 2 o x 1 l x 2 l x 3 l xe 3 5 this invention seeks to highlight a distinction between joint basic observables and contingent observable xm xo 1 xo 2 xl 1 xl 2 xl 3 xe f xm f xo 1 xo 2 xl 1 xl 2 xl 3 xe respectively there are actual as opposed to invented or meaningless physical phenomena which lend themselves to this kind of mathematical description 3 but it is easier at this stage to avoid any complications which might arise with real as opposed to invented physical entities if f xm fxm i m exists then b is a contingent random variable with expected value e b f xm fxm i m 4 rm f x 1 o x 2 o x 1 l x 2 l x 3 l xe fxm i m where rm denotes the structured product domain s s r r r r and m mo ml me for 4 to be meaningful in the riemann observable sense rm must qualify as stieltjes complete integral as defined in chapter 4 of 6 essentially this means there must be gauges divisions and riemann sums which satisfy the conditions of chapter 4 the single most important step in this from which most of the others follow directly is the divisibility property which in 6 is established in theorem 4 page 121 in this case 4 can simply be treated as an integral on r 6 in fact a sub domain of r 6 with x x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 replacing x xo xl xe but it is instructive to treat it instead as an integral on a cartesian product of the three domains s s r r r and r the first two of these are themselves cartesian products and the associated elements in the three domains are respectively xo i mo xl i ml xe i me with gauges xo xl and xe the structured product domain s s r r r r is to be denoted by rm a point x xm of rm is xo xl xe this is not quite the same as x 1 o x 2 o x 1 l x 2 l x 3 l xe r 6 though as mentioned above the latter is a bit simpler and works equally well in the theory cells i im in rm are io il ie again the more straightforward cartesian product of six one dimensional component cells can also be used in this case 6 the point cell elements of rm are xm im and these elements are asso ciated if each of xo xl xe is associated with respectively io il ie in s s r r r and r the point xm is an associated point or tag point of cell im if xm is a vertex of im the set of tag points of rm is r m which is rm with points at infinity adjoined a gauge in rm is a function xm defined for each tag point of rm an associated point cell pair xm im is fine if each of the components xo io xl il xe ie is fine in the manner described in 6 for each of the component domains s s r r r and the domain r of course association and fineness can in this case be treated equally well by taking rm to be a straightforward six dimensional cartesian product but the more structured approach may be more helpful in the longer run for this to be of any use the conditions and properties of the integration theory of 6 chapter 4 must be met by the structured elements xm im of rm the single biggest issue here is theorem 4 pages 121 124 of 6 we must prove fine divisibility of rm and its sub domains that is given any gauge the integration domain rm has a fine division but unlike theorem 4 rm involves only finite cartesian products there fore the proof of divisibility in rm is not like theorem 4 instead it is similar to the standard or classical proof which is outlined on page 45 of 6 the well known proof runs as follows theorem 1 given a gauge on rm there exists a fine division d of rm d xm im likewise if rm is replaced as domain by any cell or figure in rm proof assume for contradiction that the statement is false each component in the cartesian product rm s s r r r r can be bisected successively at each stage a sub domain is found to be non divisible as in section 2 3 page 45 of 6 this gives a contradiction with this result to hand it is not difficult to reproduce the theory of riemann observables for structured domains such as rm therefore equation 4 is valid and it is possible to incorporate this kind of random variable into the theory of 6 the preceding examples present some contrasting problems in example 2 there are three dimensions labelled o l and e representing respectively the two three and one dimensional domains s s r r r and r in contrast example 1 has infinitely many dimensions each labelled t for t 0 and each dimension t representing a three dimensional cartesian product space r 3 r r r where for i 1 2 3 the unpredictable measurement 7 x i t or xi t is the ith co ordinate of a brownian particle at time t 0 t so x t xi t i 1 2 3 x 1 t x 2 t x 3 t r 3 before proceeding with this construction here are some background issues involving gauges for product spaces 4 gauges for product spaces example 3 a gauge in a one dimensional domain such as r is a function y 0 defined for y r section 2 17 pages 79 81 of 6 introduces gauges for the finite dimensional cartesian product domain rn where n is any positive integer such a gauge is simply x 0 for x r n use the symbol a to distinguish such a gauge from b in 5 below to keep track of dimensions denote the domain rn by rn n j 1 rj where rj r for each j and where a typical element of r j is denoted by xj and x x 1 xn is a typical element of r n assume that a gauge j xj 0 is defined for each rj the question posed here is whether a gauge b x b x 1 xn can be constructed from component gauges j for the product space r n n 1 rj in 6 there is no presumption of elements j xj instead a function x x 1 xn is defined for x r n without considering any of the one dimens ional elements j xj however it is perfectly feasible to construct a gauge in rn as the following composite of the j b x 1 x 1 n xn 5 where component gauges j xj are assumed to be given for each rj r with this definition of gauge b the next question is to attribute meaning to b fine in rn therefore suppose x i x 1 xn i 1 in is an associated pair in rn so xj ij are associated in rj r for j 1 n then with gauge b given by 5 we declare that x i is b fine in rn if xj ij is j fine in rj for 1 j n here are some properties of a and b gauges 1 given b if x i is b fine then there exists a gauge a such that x i is a fine for each x x 1 xn simply take a x min 1 x 1 n xn 8 2 thus if h x i is defined on rn and if h is integrable on rn with respect to b gauges with integral value then h is integrable on rn with respect to a gauges for by hypothesis with 0 given there exists a gauge b so that for every b fine division db of rn db h x i now choose a as in 1 to complete the proof 3 conversely with a given it is not possible to define a gauge b which en sures that every a fine pair x i is also b fine this is analogous 1 to the extra discrimination that riemann complete gauge functions y y r provide in comparison with the constant of standard rie mann integration to see this consider any b gauge in a bounded two dimensional domain s 0 1 0 1 b x b x 1 x 2 1 x 1 2 x 2 where j is a gauge in 0 1 with 1 j xj 0 j 1 2 let a x be a x a x 1 x 2 1 x 1 2 x 2 then for each x x 1 x 2 s there are cells ij j 1 2 with a x 1 x 1 2 x 2 ij j xj for j 1 2 so x i is b fine but not a fine 4 this means that just like riemann integration with constant 0 and riemann complete integration with variable function y 0 there are functions h x i h x 1 x 2 i 1 i 2 which are integrable if the riemann sums are formed with gauges a but are not integrable with gauges b we can say that a integration is stronger than b integration in the way that riemann complete integration is stronger than riemann integra tion that is a function f which fails to be riemann integrable may be riemann complete integrable in review of this point the role of a gauge such as a or b is to restrict the associated pairs x i which can be admitted as members of division d in the formation of riemann sums d h x i which are used to estimate h x i with d h x i as integrability criterion the more restrictive the gauge the stronger the integral 1 the analogy a x corresponds to y and b x corresponds to constant 9 5 taking this to extremes if the gauge is such that every x i is admis sible then only 2 the constant function h is integrable at the other extreme if no x i is admissible then every function h is integrable the mathematically useful integration scenarios lie between these two ex tremes 6 despite the preceding issues fubini s theorem 6 pages 160 165 some times enables us to get a connection between a integrals and b integrals in rn for instance suppose x i x 1 x 2 i 1 i 2 in r 2 and sup pose h x i h 1 x 1 i 1 h 2 x 2 i 2 now suppose h is a integrable in r 2 then fubini s theorem implies r 2 h x i r 2 r h 1 x 1 i 1 h 2 x 2 i 2 r h 1 x 1 i 1 r h 2 x 2 i 2 since the latter two integrals are one dimensional the a gauges reduce to b gauges in these two integrals 7 the preceding argument based on fubini s theorem for a integrals can be extended to integrals in rn and it can be extended to some other kinds of integrands provided the iterated integrals of fubini s theorem are ex pressible as successive integrals with respect to variables xj j 1 n each of which is reducible to a b integral 8 the a integral is stronger than the b integral but a survey of the results and properties of the complete integral rn h x i a version in 6 shows that all results are equally valid for the corresponding statements expressed in terms of gauges b the definition of the gauge integral is as follows a function h x i is integrable on rn with integral value if given 0 there exists a gauge such that if d is a fine division of rn then d h x i if there are no fine divisions d of rn then this definition is vacuous implying as per point 5 above that every function h is integrable existence of fine divisions is therefore the foundation of every form of complete integration for gauges of form a this issue is addressed in various places in 6 such as section 2 3 page 45 using the method of successive bisection existence of divisions relative to gauges of form b can be easily established by the same method 2 theorem 67 page 180 of 6 gives an example of an integrand h x i taking the form f x d i which is integrable if and only if f is constant 10 theorem 2 given a gauge b in rn there exists a b fine division of rn proof assuming non divisibility for contradiction successive bisection de livers a point x x 1 xn r n and using the gauge values j xj for this point a b fine cell i can be found and this proves divisibility of rn 5 gauges for infinite dimensional spaces the preceding discussion demonstrates that there are alternative ways of setting up a complete system of integration for product spaces these ideas are also helpful in formulating such a system when the product is infinite that is for domain r rather than rn this is illustrated as follows example 4 suppose t 0 and the domain of integration is the infinite dimensional cartesian product space rt t t r t t rt where rt r for each t t in 6 several approaches to this are discussed but the method which is selected for use throughout the rest of the book is de scribed in section 4 2 pages 116 119 this can be summarized as follows l r t n t xt 7 l xt n t r t n t 0 xt n 7 xt n 0 6 the purpose of is with finite dimension set n l xt selected from the preceding line to regulate the lengths i t of the restricted edges i t t n of associated pairs xt i n in r t only a finite number of edges of i n is restricted as discussed in 6 this is suggestive of gauge restriction of edges of finite dimensional cells i n in the finite dimensional cartesian product domain rn example 3 describes two ways of providing gauge restriction for i n a a gauge a x n 0 with i t a x n for each t n b a gauge b x n t x t t n with i t b x t for each t n where b y 0 is a gauge in r rt for each t n but while 6 mentions option a above the book chooses instead the following form of gauge restriction for i n c a gauge c xt n 0 with i t c xt n for each t n in other words for each t n the restriction on the edge i t of i n depends on every component x t t t infinite of x t r t and not just on the finite number of components x t for t n as described in a above 11 it is easily seen that c gives a stronger integral than a which is in turn stronger than b as discussed in example 3 but the extra strength of c is superfluous for present purposes examination of the results in 6 which use c show that they can also be obtained with gauges a or b for present purposes it is more convenient here to use gauges b in rt and also in other infinite dimensional cartesian product spaces under discussion accordingly and for purposes of reference here is the relevant description of the chosen gauge for rt l r t n t xt 7 l xt n t n r n rn x n 7 t x t t n r n 7 where r 0 the gauge for rt is the pair l n which can be denoted by b since the n component has the form b of example 3 but whenever it is not likely to be confused with the gauges in 6 the notation l n can be used the essential components of a gauge in rt are therefore as follows for each t t there is a gauge t in the corresponding domain r if t contains only a finite number of elements t then a gauge in rt is t x t t t where xt it is fine if xt it is t fine for each t t if t contains infinitely many elements t then as in 7 above a func tion l is used to select for each xt r t l r t n t xt 7 l xt n t for infinite t a gauge in rt can then be written l t x t t t and an associated pair x i n in rt is fine if n l x and xt it is t fine for each t n thus for infinite t a gauge can be written alternatively as l n or l t t t as divisibility is the basis of complete integration fine divisibility must be established as in theorem 1 but since t is infinite the simple bisection argu ment of section 2 3 page 45 of 6 is not sufficient and a proof on the lines of theorem 4 pages 121 124 of 6 is needed the formulation of the latter proof is by necessity burdened with quite a lot of technical notation the following example seeks to give the underlying idea in a simpler less technical way 12 example 5 suppose s 0 1 and the domain of integration is s 3 0 1 0 1 0 1 with associated elements x i x 1 x 2 x 3 i 1 i 2 i 3 where for i 1 2 3 xi is an element of 0 1 and ii is a cell u v s 0 1 a gauge is a function x 1 x 2 x 3 0 defined for 0 xi 1 i 1 2 3 the usual way to prove divisibility is by a process of successive bisection qi 1 2 r qi 1 1 2 r qi 2 2 r qi 2 1 2 r qi 3 2 r qi 3 1 2 r qik 0 1 2 r 1 k 1 2 3 and r 1 2 3 then an initial assumption of non divisibility eventually produces a contradiction but in line with the proof of theorem 4 pages 121 124 of 6 and dropping much of the technical notation denote the three dimensions by t 1 t 2 t 3 instead of 1 2 3 think of the domain s 3 as a cubical block of cheese each of whose edges has length 1 1 instead of bisecting the unit cube into successively smaller cubes select one dimension only t 1 for successive bisection the initially cubical block of cheese is converted by successively slicing along one dimension into successively thinner slices of cheese of which at each stage at least one slice jr irt 1 s s must be non divisible from the initial assumption of non divisibility as the bisection value r tends to infinity a value y 1 or yt 1 is arrived at by the usual bisection argument and at each stage of bisection yt 1 is the fixed t 1 co ordinate of a point yt 1 xt 2 xt 3 which is the associated point or tag point of slice jr 2 the next step is to consider a domain s s with dimension t 1 removed we take a paper thin slice of cheese actually so thin that it has thickness zero consisting in space of the points yt 1 xt 2 xt 3 with yt 1 fixed and 0 xti 1 for i 1 2 this is no longer really a slice of cheese it is mathematically a two dimensional cartesian product domain 0 1 0 1 define a gauge on this domain by x 2 x 3 xt 2 xt 3 yt 1 xt 2 xt 3 by the original assumption this two dimensional domain must be non delta divisible with the new two dimensional meaning of because if there is a fine division d of s s or if preferred of yt 1 s s with d xt 2 xt 3 it 1 it 2 or alternatively yt 1 xt 2 xt 3 yt 1 it 1 it 2 13 then r can be chosen so that 2 r is less than yt 1 xt 2 xt 3 for each of the finite number of tag points yt 1 xt 2 xt 3 of d with fixed yt 1 but then a delta fine division of ir s s can be produced from the terms of d yt 1 xt 2 xt 3 i r t 1 it 1 it 2 so if the two dimensional paper thin cheese sheet is divisible then for sufficiently large r the somewhat thin three dimensional cheese slices of 1 above are divisible which contradicts the original hypothesis of non divisibility 3 now select a second dimension t 2 and again commence successive bisec tion of the vanishingly thin cheese sheet this time in the direction t 2 leaving direction t 3 unbisected this produces a succession of non divisible two dimensional strips of width 2 r and length 1 leading as before to a fixed value yt 2 from the intersection of the strips 4 finally we get a non divisible one dimensional line in direction t 3 and further bisection gives fixed yt 3 giving a fixed point y yt 1 yt 2 yt 3 in s s s taking r large enough a cell irt 1 i r t 2 irt 3 is found to be divisible with y as tag point and this is found to contradict the original assumption of non divisibility of s s s as pointed out at the start of example 5 the exact same result can be obtained directly by simultaneously bisecting in all three dimensions so why take the rather more complicated route of bisecting in one dimension at a time the next example demonstrates that this method can indeed be useful example 6 instead of s s s with s 0 1 suppose t represents a countably infinite number of dimensions t 1 t 2 t 3 and suppose r st is the domain to be considered in a finite dimensional domain such as s 3 or sn a gauge is a function x 0 but in infinite dimensions t s t t there is an additional condition for each finite subset n t x n 0 is defined 3 on the finite dimensional domain t s t n in a way this makes a supposedly infinite dimensional st look like a straightforward finite dimensional sn but there is a catch it is true that something like sn occurs in the sense of something resembling a riemann sum estimate of sn but there is a further condition on the gauges for each xt a minimal finite set l xt t is specified and in forming riemann sum estimates of st we allow only those finite dimensional cells i n for which n l xt the definition of a gauge l is such that in choosing gauges the cardinality of the finite sets n l x can be arbitrarily large while the corresponding numbers x n can be 3 strictly speaking 6 uses the more sophisticated function xt n 0 but as mentioned in example 4 x n 0 works fine also the version n x n t xt t n 14 arbitrarily small these ideas are illustrated graphically in 6 pages 81 87 and especially 102 the issue here is with any gauge l given that the domain st must be divisible for the theory to work there is a proof of this kind in 6 theorem 4 pages 121 124 in example 5 above aspects of this proof are illustrated but only for t of finite cardinality the underlying intent of the proof in example 5 in which t is a finite set is demonstrated in the present example in which t is infinite 1 assume st is non divisible 2 as in example 5 above choose any dimension label that is choose any element of t we have already enumerated t as t 1 t 2 t 3 so let the choice be t 1 3 there is no harm in continuing to visualise st as a cube or block of cheese anyway our powers of geometric visualisation do not easily extend to more than three dimensions in reality st is a hyper cube so to speak that is a hyper block of cheese 4 as in example 5 bisect successively st in dimension t 1 only that is successively re slice the hyper block of cheese into ever thinner slivers as before this produces cells slices j 1 j 2 j 3 each of which must be non divisible by assumption 1 above as before a common fixed number yt 1 is arrived at 5 now get rid of dimension t 1 so the hyper block of cheese becomes a flat hyper block or hyper plane st t 1 choose a second dimension t 2 bisect again and find another fixed co ordinate yt 2 6 thus far the argument is similar to example 5 in that case we arrived at dimension t 3 bisected in that dimension found yt 3 and then stopped there because there were no more dimensions to slice the proof was then com pleted by finding a contradiction to assumption 1 but in this case there are further dimensions t 4 t 5 and we can never stop in other words for j 1 2 3 we find inductively fixed co ordinates ytj giving by induction a single fixed point yt in s t 7 thus the final or t 3 step in example 5 is not available to us when t is infinite to see how to salvage the argument remember that the gauge is not just but also includes a factor l xt a finite subset of t a possibly different finite set for each xt essentially it is the finiteness of the set l yt see step 6 that gives a contradiction to 1 forcing an eventual stop to the iteration return to steps 2 3 and 4 above where the fixed co ordinate yt 1 has been found now consider the hyperplane z 1 t zt yt 1 zt 2 zt 3 ztj s j 2 3 4 15 8 suppose for contradiction that there is in z 1 t a point z 1 yt 1 zt 2 zt 3 for which l z 1 t 2 t 3 so l z 1 t 1 choose r so that 2 r z 1 t 1 or 2 r z 1 t 1 or 2 r z 1 t 1 t 1 8 depending on which version of gauge is in question from this it is easy to find a cell or cells ir which form a fine division of the cell jr in step 4 above giving a contradiction 9 therefore if 1 is valid then for each point zt yt 1 zt 2 zt 3 of the hyperplane z 1 t the set l zt of the gauge contains a co ordinate label tk with k 1 10 likewise with step 5 completed a hyper hyper plane z 2 t of the hyper plane z 1 t is considered and the assumption of non divisibility in 1 above implies that the set l z 2 t l yt 1 yt 2 zt 3 zt 4 contains a co ordinate label tk with k 2 11 but in step 6 a fixed point yt yt 1 yt 2 yt 3 is arrived at the set l yt is defined in the gauge and consists of a finite set s 1 s 2 sn t with s 1 s 2 sn tm for some m so k m implies tk l yt 12 assumption 1 implies that iteration m of the single coordinate bisection process delivers a coordinate label tk with k m for which tk l yt l yt 1 ytm ytm 1 ytm 2 with yt 1 ytm ytm 1 ytm 2 zmt contradicting step 11 thus assumption 1 gives a contradiction and must therefore be false the argument can be adapted for uncountable t as demonstrated in the proof of theorem 4 in 6 16 the steps above establish divisibility for all three versions of gauge in rt including the version b defined in 7 the condition labelled 8 above is the critical step thus the following corresponds to theorem 4 page 120 124 of 6 and as shown above has almost identical proof theorem 3 given a gauge or b defined as 7 there exists a fine divi sion of rt proof with minor adaptations the proof follows that of example 6 6 higher dimensional brownian motion the reason for the preceding comments on product gauges is to seek to for mulate three dimensional brownian motion in terms of the system of complete integration returning to this issue and following the scheme established in example 2 let t denote 0 and let sample space be r 3 t r 3 t t r 3 t if n is any finite subset of t let rn denote r 3 t n with finite dimensional points xn cells in association xn in and gauges defined as in example 2 and 5 for any finite set n n t a cell i it it n in r 3 t is it in rt n so if n t 1 tn 0 it it n n j 1 i 1 tj i 2 tj i 3 tj rt n where each component term of the cartesian product rt n is r r r in physical terms to say that xt i means that for dimensions i 1 2 3 at time tj 1 j n the ith co ordinate of the spatial position of the particle lies in the real interval ii tj and for any time t n the ith co ordinate of the particle in space is unspecified or arbitrary for each of i 1 2 3 a point cell pair xt it n are associated in r 3 t if xn in are asso ciated in rn that means that as one dimensional objects xi tj ii tj xi j ii j are associated in r for i 1 2 3 and for tj n next define a gauge in r 3 t as follows 4 for each xt x 1 t x 2 t x 3 t t t in r 3 t that is r 3 t with points at infinity added and for each finite set n n t let l r r r t n t where xt 7 l xt n t and 4 remember r 3 t is r 3 t not rt 17 n r r r n r r r n 9 where xn 7 t x 1 t t x 2 t t x 3 t t n a gauge in r 3 t consists of l n n l x 10 given a gauge an associated point cell pair xt it n in r 3 t is fine if n l xt and if xn in is n fine in rn the latter means that for each t n the one dimensional pair xi t ii t xi t ii t is t fine in r for i 1 2 3 and for each t n armed with understanding from example 6 a proof of divisibility of the structured domain r 3 t r r r t can be addressed as follows theorem 4 given a gauge l n of r 3 t there exists a fine division d xt it n of r 3 t proof assume for contradiction that there is no division of r 3 t the first lines page 121 of 6 of the proof of theorem 4 carry forward unchanged but the bisection in dimension t 1 indicated by cells i r at the bottom of page 121 need to be amended as follows in dimension t 1 of r 3 t for i 1 2 3 let each of iri t 1 denote one of the one dimensional cells in the last line of page 121 and with additional subscript labels 1 2 3 relating to the three cartesian components of the single dimension t 1 let ir t 1 i r 1 t 1 i r 2 t 1 i r 3 t 1 or i r t 1 ir 1 t 1 i r 2 t 1 ir 3 t 1 so ir t 1 is a cell of r 3 for emphasis the label t 1 can be in line rather than subscripted line 2 of page 122 in 6 therefore gives a fixed y t 1 y 1 t 1 y 2 t 1 y 3 t 1 r t 1 r r r the novel and crucial part of the proof occurs in lines 3 to 13 of page 122 for r 3 t this part of the proof carries forward practically unchanged likewise the re definition of the gauge in lines 14 to 19 the rest of the proof consists of iterations of these steps leading to contradiction of the initial assumption this result is the first step in providing a riemann observable domain or sample space r r r t for three dimensional brownian motion the proof for n dimensional brownian motion rn t is essentially the same and if such is required it works for domain rnt t t where t is infinite and each nt is a positive integer depending on t in theorem 4 which is aimed at three dimensional brownian motion nt 3 for each t t theorem 4 deals with divisibility of domain r r r t with t infinite the following example describes a different structure also involving infinite t and similar to r 3 t 18 example 7 let rt rt rt rt 3 to be denoted rt 3 for short elements of rt 3 have the form xt x x 1 x 2 x 3 where x xt 1 xt 2 xt 3 xt j t t j 1 2 3 xt 1 xt 2 xt 3 t t 11 with xt j xtj r for j 1 2 3 as to notation it is sometimes easier to perceive the meaning if the label j j 1 2 3 is written as superscript instead of subscript so the following representation is allowed x xt x 1 t t t x 2 t t t x 3 t t t a cell it i i n in rt 3 is i 1 n i 2 n i 3 n where n t 1 tn is any finite subset of t and for t n and for 1 j 3 ij t itj i j t i r so i it n 3 j 1 it 1 j it 2 j itn j r t n a pair xt it n are associated in rt 3 if for each t n and j 1 2 3 the one dimensional pair xtj itj are associated in r the new domain rt 3 rt 3 is a finite product of infinite products the next step is to construct a gauge for the domain rt 3 the underlying method of construction of gauges for product spaces is to use already defined gauges for the component domains of the product domain and form a product of such gauges this works even when the new gauge is a product of product gauges so it is assumed that for each t t and each y r one dimensional gauges t y 0 are given in the case of rt 3 for each element x r t 3 let l x be a finite subset of t and for each n t 1 tn n t and for each y yn y j ti ti n j 1 2 3 r n let n y y 1 ti y 2 ti y 3 ti ti n now define a gauge in rt 3 as l n for all x r t 3 and all n n t 12 then the associated pair xt it n are fine if n l xt and xt j it j are t fine in r for each t n 19 if n contains n elements then a cell i n has a total of 3 n restricted one dimensional component cells it j or i j t for t n and for j 1 2 3 essentially a gauge for rt 3 regulates each of these edges by means of the corresponding values of the 3 n associated points y j t r the condition n l xt in the gauge ensures that the dimension sets n that appear in riemann sums contain arbitrarily large numbers of elements here is a quick reminder of how the complete integral of a function h is defined by means of gauges if h xt n i n is a real or complex valued func tion then h is integrable on rt 3 with integral rt 3 h if the following holds given 0 there exists a gauge l n such that for every fine division d of rt 3 d h xt n i n this definition is empty and meaningless unless the required divisions d of rt 3 exists when fine divisions are shown to exist elaboration of the properties of the complete integral h follows a common pattern and the theory described in chapter 4 of 6 is generally applicable thus the basis of the integration in rt 3 is the following theorem theorem 5 given a gauge for rt 3 as defined in 12 there exists a fine division of rt 3 proof this theorem is also valid if rt 3 is replaced by any cell i of rt 3 assume for contradiction that no fine division of rt 3 exists for simplic ity assume also that t is a countable set t 1 2 so rt 3 rt rt rt r r r r r r r r r r rt 1 r rt 1 r rt 1 the proof can be adapted for uncountable t as in theorem 4 of 6 the product domain has three components corresponding to j 1 2 3 and each of the three components is a composite of factors r rt 1 rj 1 r t 1 for j 1 2 3 now bisect successively the term rj 1 jointly for j 1 2 3 of the three factors so that at each bisection a non divisible cell is obtained as in example 6 the successive bisections yield y 1 1 r t 1 y 2 1 r t 1 y 3 1 r t 1 20 this procedure can be repeated successively for j 2 3 leading to a suc cession of non divisible cells in domains rt 1 2 k for k 2 3 thus a point y y 1 1 y 2 1 y 3 1 y 1 2 y 2 2 y 3 2 y 1 3 y 2 3 y 3 3 rt 3 is arrived at by iteration and as in example 6 if l y m and if m max i i m the original assumption of non divisibility fails at the m th stage in the preceding iteration with corresponding division structures the preceding results can be estab lished for domains rt n for any positive integer n also variants of 12 can be substituted without causing difficulty in the preceding proof of divisibility the domain r 3 t or r 3 t with t of infinite cardinality was introduced in example 1 as a sample space domain for three dimensional brownian motion this has sample values x 1 t x 2 t x 3 t for t t representing the coordinates in r r r of a brownian particle at any time t t t 0 in contrast example 7 has domain rt 3 with sample values or represen tative elements xt 1 xt 2 xt 3 t t as described in 11 since the numerical value of t is the same in each instance of xjt j 1 2 3 there is no essential physical difference between examples 1 and 7 7 products of product spaces the progression has been from finite cartesian product spaces rn to infinite cartesian product spaces rt and then to compound finite infinite cartesian product domains the latter were described in examples 1 and 7 respectively r 3 t rt 3 or rp t rt p with p finite and t infinite it is natural to inquire whether the complete structure can be formulated for rp t with both t and p infinite for simplicity countably infinite before tackling this the following example gives a different interpretation of rt 3 example 8 suppose t j are countably infinite labelling sets for j 1 2 3 and suppose is a composite infinite finite cartesian product domain rt 1 rt 2 rt 3 13 21 whose elements are x x xt 1 xt 2 xt 3 xt 1 t 1 t 1 xt 2 t 2 t 2 xt 3 t 3 t 3 14 if t 1 t 2 t 3 t then has the form r t rt rt but not with the same meaning as the space rt 3 above if we follow 14 a representative element of is x x xt 1 xt 2 xt 3 xt 1 t t xt 2 t t xt 3 t t 15 despite superficial appearances the space of the latter elements is not the same as the space rt 3 of example 7 which uses the symbolic name rt 3 the difference between these two domains is expressed in the difference between their representative elements in 11 and 15 in 11 the t of xt j is the same for j 1 2 3 while in 15 the t of xt j may be different for j 1 2 3 to make the distinction clearer denote the space consisting of elements 11 and 15 by respectively rt 3 r t 3 or for short rt 3 rt 3 respectively each element 11 is also an element 15 but not conversely so rt 3 r t 3 cells i in rt 3 are constructed as cartesian products of cells ij n j i rt j 1 2 3 as follows with n j n t j 1 2 3 let n n 1 n 2 n 3 write this as n n t t t and define i it t t it 3 i n i 1 n 1 i 2 n 2 i 3 n 3 so i it t t it 3 i n 3 j 1 t nj it j rt n j 16 where for j 1 2 3 and for t n j it j or i j t is 5 a one dimensional real interval itj i j t i r a point cell pair x i n are associated in rt 3 if for j 1 2 3 xt j i j n j are associated in rtj rt so x j tj i j tj are associated in r for each tj n j j 1 2 3 5 as to notation the label j is used in both subscript and superscript form to distinguish between the component domains rt in rt rt rt or r t 3 or rt 3 accordingly it is plausible to write the one dimensional component cells it j as i j t depending on which version provides better intuition 22 next define a gauge in rt 3 assume that for j 1 2 3 and each t t there is a gauge j t y 0 for y r let l x l 1 x 1 t l 2 x 2 t l 3 x 3 t n t n t n t a gauge in rt 3 is l where j t t t j 1 2 3 17 with n n 1 n 2 n 3 n t n t n t an associated pair x i n is fine in rt 3 if for j 1 2 3 n j lj xjt and x j tj i j tj is j tj fine in r for each tj n j existence of fine divisions of rt 3 is proved in theorem 6 below theorem 6 given a gauge l there exists a fine division of rt 3 proof for each j j 1 2 3 take j lj j where j t t t then by the construction in 17 there exists a fine division of rt 3 if and only there exists a j fine division of rt for each j but the latter holds by theorem 4 of 6 8 illustration of products of products in order to distinguish clearly between the two domains rt 3 and rt 3 and to provide motivation clarification and intuition here are some illustrations which demonstrate the different roles of rt 3 and rt 3 rt 3 suppose t 0 and for t t xtj or x j t is the share value of one of three stocks labelled j for j 1 2 3 if for each of the three stocks and for any given time t the share value xtj has a distribution function fxtj defined on cells itj i r then for each t j the unpredictable share value xtj is a sample value of an observable xtj xtj fxtj r 18 the general real valued ample space r is assumed if for each j there is a joint distribution function fxtj defined on cylindrical intervals i n i rt then xtj or x j t is a joint observable or joint process xtj xtj fxtj r t 19 now for any given t t consider the joint share values xt xt 1 xt 2 xt 3 x 1 t x 2 t x 3 t 20 23 suppose for each t and for j 1 2 3 there exists a joint distribution function fxt defined on cells it it 1 it 2 it 3 i 1 t i 2 t i 3 t i r 3 21 suppose for each finite set n t 1 tn n t and it n j 1 2 3 it 1 j it 2 j itnj r t n 22 there is a joint distribution function fxt it n defined on cells it n i rt 3 then xt is an observable process xt xt fxt rt 3 23 now suppose a derivative asset y y is constructed so that at time the holder of the derivative asset receives a payment of amount if at any time t t 0 the sum of the values of the three underlying assets exceeds a specified amount and otherwise the holder of the derivative receives nothing thus y f xt f xt 1 xt 2 xt 3 if 3 j 1 xt j for some t t 0 otherwise 24 then the contingent observable y is a contingent random variable if its expected value exists e y rt 3 f xt fxt i n 25 the latter if it exists is the expected payoff of the derivative asset y rt 3 the next step is to provide a practical illustration of joint random variation on domain r t 3 rt 3 and in doing so to take note of how this kind of random variation con trasts with the preceding as before xtj or x j t is the share value of any one of three stocks j 1 2 3 as before a distribution function fxtj defined on cells itj i r is assumed with observable xtj xtj fxtj r 26 also a joint distribution function fxtj is defined on cylindrical intervals i n i rt so xtj is a joint observable or joint process xtj xtj fxtj r t 27 so far everything is as before but at this point we depart from the previous scheme in the preceding example xt represented xt j j 1 2 3 or 24 xt 1 xt 2 xt 3 in which time t is the same for each component but what is now needed is joint share values of the form described in example 8 xt t t xt 3 xt 1 1 xt 2 2 xt 3 3 t 1 t 2 t 3 t x 1 t 1 x 2 t 2 x 3 t 3 t 1 t 2 t 3 t 28 where the times tj may be different for j 1 2 3 thus xt 3 xt 1 xt 2 xt 3 or xt 3 x 1 t x 2 t x 3 t where the latter representation emphasises the fact that rt 3 is the carte sian product rt rt rt write xt 3 as x or as xt 3 if clarity requires this as described in example 8 cells i in rt 3 are cartesian products of cells ij n j i rt j 1 2 3 as in example 8 with n j n t and j 1 2 3 n n 1 n 2 n 3 n t n t n t i it t t it 3 i n i 1 n 1 i 2 n 2 i 3 n 3 3 j 1 t nj it j rt n j 29 where for j 1 2 3 and for t n j it j or i j t is a one dimensional real interval itj i j t i r now suppose there is some joint measurement or observation of unpredictable values xt j or x j t for t t and j 1 2 3 and sup pose these unpredictable values are regulated by a joint distribution function fxt 3 i n defined on cells i n i rt 3 30 then xt 3 is an observable process xt 3 xt 3 fxt r t 3 31 the next step is to envision some practical scenario which realizes this ab stract conceptual framework of domains or sample spaces and observables an adaptation of the example given in rt 3 above provides illustration accordingly suppose a derivative asset y y is constructed so that at time the holder of the derivative asset receives a payment of amount if at any time tj 0 tj j 1 2 3 the sum of the values of the three underlying assets exceeds a specified amount and otherwise the holder of the derivative receives nothing thus y f xt 3 if 3 j 1 x j tj for some t 1 t 2 t 3 t 0 otherwise 32 25 then the contingent observable y is a contingent random variable if its expected value exists e y rt 3 f xt 3 fxt 3 i n 33 the latter if it exists as an integral value is the expected payoff of the derivative asset y the difference between 32 and 24 is that in the latter the time t is the same for the three underlying assets j 1 2 3 while in the former the three times t 1 t 2 t 3 may be different for some all of the three underlying assets 9 infinite products of infinite products example 9 it is straightforward to extend the meaning of examples 7 and 8 to domains rt n rtn and r tn rt n where n is any positive integer in the development of the theory finite dimensional domains rn have been extended to infinite dimensional domains rt this suggests that in rt n and or r t n the finite n may be replaced by an infinite set p of dimension labels giving rt p rtp and or r tp rt p we will now provide some meaning to these specifically the latter rt p for simplicity it is assumed that both t and p are countable since p p 1 p 2 is countable the members of the set r t p rt p consist of sequences xp 1 xp 2 xpj where each term xpj is itself a sequence xt 1 pj xt 2 pj xti pj xti 1 pj or x 1 j x 2 j xi j xi 1 j or x j 1 x j 2 x j i x j i 1 where these three equivalent notations are used in various contexts thus if x rt p x xt p xij ti t pj p and in notation whose ambiguity is exemplified in 24 32 the domain is r t p p t r t t p p the next step is to specify cells i in the domain can be represented as sp with s rt for np p 1 pn n p a cell i of sp is i jp 1 jpn s p np j np rt p np 26 where each jpj is a cell it j or i j t in r t so if nt j n j t t 1 j tmj j t j 1 t j mj n p a cell jpj of r t is jpj it j i nt j r t nt j it 1 pj it 2 pj itmj pj r t nt j i pj t 1 ipjt 2 i pj tmj rt nt j thus for np n p and nt j n t a cell of domain rt p is it p n j 1 it nt j rt p np 34 n j 1 it 1 pj it 2 pj itmj pj r t nt j rt p np pj np tij nt j itij pj t t nt j r p p np rt loosely it p can be written i ntp np consider a point x xt p and a cell i it p of r t p so xt p xt p t t p p it p n j 1 it nt j rt p np 35 with np p 1 pj pn and nt j t 1 j tmj j for j 1 n then the pair xt p it p are associated in rt p if for each nt j j 1 n the cell i nt j has the point x nt j as a vertex in r nt j expressed as points and intervals of r this means that xti pj x pj ti r is a vertex of the corre sponding restricted cell iti pj i pj ti r for 1 i mj 1 j n to define complete integrals on rt p gauges must be formulated to regulate the associated pairs xt p it p ntp np used in forming riemann sums it is assumed that for each component r of the compound product space rt p there is a gauge p t y 0 for y r and it is assumed that for each component product space rt rt p p p of rt p there is a gauge p lp pt in rt constructed in the standard way for standard product space rt a gauge for the compound product space rt p is formed from the compo nent gauges p and p t as follows for each x of r t p let l x be an element n np n p and let t p l p p p p t t t p p 27 then the associated pair x i xt p it p of rt p is fine if in 35 np p 1 pn l x x pj t i pj t is pj fine for j 1 n 36 in other words x i is fine if p 1 pn l x 37 tpj 1 t pj mj lpj xpjt for j 1 n and 38 x pj ti i pj ti is pj ti fine in r for 1 i mj 1 j n 39 the purpose of the gauge construction is to define the complete integral of some function h x i on the domain rt p for this to work there have to be fine divisions of the domain in order to be able to form riemann sum estimates of the integral theorem 7 given a gauge in rt p there exists a fine division of rt p proof the general idea of the proof is a development or extension of the method of successive bisection combined with successive slicing described in example 6 assume for contradiction that there is no fine division of the domain for simplicity the sets t and p are assumed countable so write p p 1 p 2 t t 1 t 2 select dimension p 1 so with s rt and p 1 p p 1 rt p s rt p p 1 s rt p 1 successively bisect s r t 1 t 2 as follows for s q 2 q q 2 q 1 q 2 q 2 q 2 q 1 write isq as one of the s q binary one dimensional cells q s 2 q s 1 2 q q for r 1 2 3 let nr t 1 t 2 r and for each q let jqr be a cell in s rt jqr jqr nr i 1 q i 2 q irq rt nr where for s 1 2 r isq is an arbitrary s q binary one dimensional cell for each r q the cell jqr in s rt is divisible with respect to the product gauge formed from 38 and 39 above this follows from theorem 4 of 6 for r q 1 2 3 the intersection of the closures of jqr contains a point y 1 s rt consider the points y 1 xt p 1 for xt p 1 rt p 1 rt p p 1 if each of l y 1 xt p 1 consists only of p 1 then as in theorem 4 of 6 or example 6 above the assumption of non divisibility of the domain rt p 28 fails accordingly as in theorem 4 and example 6 repeat the argument for p 2 p 3 so that a point y y 1 y 2 y 3 rt p rt p is obtained for which l y is an infinite set this is impossible so the original assumption of non divisibility of rt p is disproved as in theorem 4 this is extendible to uncountable sets t and p the proof can be adapted to domains rt p q where the labelling sets t p q are infinite 10 integration in product spaces a gauge enables us to produce a system of integration in the domain the preceding examples illustrate gauges in various product spaces but what about the corresponding integrals no examples properties the orems proofs have been given above for any integrals fortunately the re quired integration theory including variation theory fubini s theorem and limit theorems follows directly from the abstract development given in 5 and in 1 2 3 4 the basic principles of this abstract division system or henstock integral are outlined in the axioms of 6 pages 111 113 the fundamental point is ds 3 the division axiom which has been established for the various product domains above because the cells i of these product spaces are essentially rectangular the other axioms ds 1 ds 2 ds 4 ds 8 apply in a straightforward way therefore since the abstract proofs are already available it is not necessary to re hash them here for the various product space examples references 1 henstock r generalised
