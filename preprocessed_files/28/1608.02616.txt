ar x iv 1 60 8 02 61 6 v 1 m at h c a 2 8 ju l 20 16 the calculus and gauge integrals by ralph henstock edited by p muldowney 1 introduction in a letter to cambridge university press dated 18 october 1993 ralph hen stock 1923 2007 proposed a book that begins with the calculus integral and ends with the properties of the gauge riemann complete generalized riemann or kurzweil henstock integral without having to define measure nor lebesgue integration and written for a beginning analyst or a scientist interested in math ematics this project has interested me for years and has been revitalised by the enclosed review of my fourth book 1 a reply 20 october 1993 by roger astley recommended an elementary treatment of the subject whilst maintaining an appropriate level of rigour in the event material for about four chapters sections 2 to 5 of this document was produced but remained unpublished in henstock archive 2007 the manuscript starts with section 2 below which contains a review of basic operations of differentiation and integration section 3 introduces the properties of real numbers by means of infinite decimals 2 this is followed by a thorough examination of the key points of traditional riemann integration framed in such a way as to lead naturally in section 4 to an exposition of riemann complete integration that is the basic gauge integral of henstock and kurzweil in beyond dominated convergence newer methods of integration mul downey 2016 argues that the post riemann development of integration theory 1 a review of the general theory of integration r henstock 1991 by robert bartle appeared in the bulletin of the american mathematical society volume 29 number 1 july 1993 pages 136 139 implying in the words of henstock the need of such a more elementary book 2 this may benefit a beginner who struggles with dedekind sections but understands that 2 is not rational and thinks of irrational real numbers as non terminating decimals 1 http arxiv org abs 1608 02616 v 1 was driven not specifically by problems of integrability of strange and exotic functions but by the quest for rules and conditions for taking limits under the integral sign such as integrating series of functions a quest which appeared to culminate in lebesgue s dominated convergence theorem this aspect of integration is what motivates this previously unpublished manuscript of henstock theorems 3 1 3 3 1 4 and 3 1 5 of henstock 1991 give necessary and sufficient conditions for taking limits under the integral sign 3 section 5 of this manuscript presents these convergence criteria in a lucid clear and careful manner and then sets the traditional monotone and domi nated convergence theorems of lebesgue in this new context this section alone warrants making this manuscript more widely available tonelli s theorem is pre sented in these terms and there are indications see 54 for example that henstock had in mind some parallel development of fubini s theorem readers who are familiar with basic integration theory can go direct to the convergence theorems in section 5 example 13 is of particular interest p muldowney july 5 2016 2 the calculus 2 1 the rules for differentiation and integration in this first chapter i have deliberately avoided the notation and exactness of modern analysis in order to look at what formulae the calculus gives before defining real numbers and a simple integration process in chapter 2 here we consider integration as an inverse operation to differentiation and assume the existence of what we need when necessary differentiation and integration were first systematized by i newton 1642 1727 and g w leibnitz 1646 1717 over the years the notations have changed to become what we now use in the simplest form of the first op eration given numbers a b and a function f x defined in the range a x b written a b and called a closed interval we could draw the graph of y f x there we use f x h f x h 1 3 see also section 4 13 pp 174 178 of muldowney 2012 and muldowney 2016 2 the gradient of the chord of the curve from x to x h naturally for h 6 0 or else we would have the ridiculous fraction 0 0 taking the limit as h 0 h positive and negative x fixed and x x h in the range we obtain the gradient of the tangent to the curve at x a value f x depending on x and so a function called the derivative of f and written dy dx or df dx or f x note that at a and b the derivative is one sided example 1 if y f t represents the distance at time t of a car driving along a road from some starting point then replacing x by t f t represents its instantaneous speed if y f t is its speed f t is its acceleration as suming that the car has constant mass the resultant of forces acting on the car is equal to the mass times the acceleration one of newton s laws con sidering rockets instead of cars the mass decreases as the propellant burns and the force is the derivative of the mass times the speed in rectilinear flight such examples explain why newton had to develop the calculus in using the calculus various rules were given which we can now write as follows if f is constant throughout a b then f 0 there 2 for f x h f x there and the fraction 1 is 0 next if the derivatives at x of f g are f x g x respectively and if m n are constants then the derivative of mf ng is mf x ng x 3 there because mf x h ng x h mf x ng x h m f x h f x h n g x h g x h mf x ng x in 3 the derivative of fg is fg fg 4 f x h g x h f x g x can be written as f x h f x g x f x g x h g x f x h f x g x h g x 3 multiplying by 1 h 1 h 1 h h the expression tends to f x g x f x g x f x g x 0 if over an x interval u v u v the function k is defined with values in a b and if dk dx is the derivative of k then the derivative of f k x is df k dk dk dx 5 normally this fails where k x h k x 0 for certain x h but as k x h k x the fraction on the left is 0 the formula still holds since the derivative of k is given to exist and so is 0 if such h are arbitrarily small for a particular x the rule for differentiating fractions can with care be deduced from these first to differentiate 1 g we have to assume g x 6 0 andg x h 6 0 for h near 0 then g x h g x g x h g x h h g x 0 g x h g x 1 g x h 1 g x h g x g x h hg x g x h g x g 2 x this with 4 gives the result if in 3 a b is an interval over which g 6 0 then the derivative of f g is fg fg g 2 6 to deduce this from 4 using f g g f needs f g differentiable our proof avoids this known differentiations begin with the identity function f x x with 1 equal to 1 if n is a constant and if x 6 0 whenever the constant n 0 then the derivative of xn is nxn 1 7 4 this is true when n 1 for other positive integers n we use mathemat ical induction suppose the result true for the integer n then by 4 the derivative of xn 1 xn x is nxn 1 x xn 1 n 1 xn and the result is true for n 1 hence true for 1 1 2 and so for 2 1 3 we step along the integers and with patience we arrive at any given positive integer next by an index law if x 0 has any meaning then x 1 x 0 x 1 0 x 1 when x x 1 6 0 this gives x 0 1 when x 0 we have 0 00 which gives nothing thus we prove the case when n 0 with x 6 0 for q a positive integer let x yq 0 then there is a y 0 with y x 1 q and by 5 1 dy dx dx dy dy dx dy dx 1 q y 1 q 1 q x 1 q 1 thus 7 is true for n 1 q x 0 using 5 and a positive integer p dx p q dx dyp dx pyp 1 dy dx p q yp q p q x p q 1 giving 7 with n p q x 0 for n p q where p q are positive integers and x 0 6 gives 7 true for n p q x 0 since xn 1 x p q dxn dx p q x p q 1 x 2 p q p q x p q 1 a ratio of two integers with positive denominator is called a rational number other numbers are irrational we thus see that 7 is true for rational numbers n with x 0 later we will define xn x 0 for n irrational and again prove 7 it may happen that for some a b u v and some functions y g x in a b with values in u v and x f y in u v with values in a b we 5 have x f g x for all x in a b then f g are called inverse functions we have already had the example x yq y x 1 q if both f and g have derivatives throughout their respective ranges then by 5 df dy dg dx d f g x ds dx dx 1 dg dx 1 df dy 8 this implies that if the derivatives of f g both exist then neither can be 0 in their respective ranges note that if fairly transparent graph paper is used for the graph of y g x with the y axis vertical and the x axis horizontal and to the right as is normal practice then turning over the graph paper with the y axis vertical and the x axis horizontal and to the left and then turning through 90 degrees the paper will have the x and y axes interchanged and showing the graph of x f y a horizontal part of y g x in the range becomes a vertical line of the x f y graph a jump or discontinuity the inverse process to the process of differentiation is called the calculus or newton indefinite integral a function f of points x in a b is the primitive or newton indefinite integral f dx of a function f in a b if f x f x throughout a b using one sided derivatives at a and b hence from the rules for differentiation we find rules for newton integration which more general integrals also obey first by 3 and the simple 2 if f is the derivative of f and c is a constant then f is the derivative of f c 9 the newton integral is not uniquely defined as we can add any constant to it also by 3 and the functions mentioned mf ng dx m f dx n g dx constant 10 assuming that all integrals exist in 3 4 we have the formula for integra tion by parts fg dx fg gf dx constant 11 from 5 and h k df dk we have df dk dk f k x df dk dk dx dx constant 6 and putting h for df dk we get h k dk h k x dk dx dx constant 12 which is the formula for integration by substitution in calculus integration to evaluate each integral it is normally treated individually by using the above rules in a systematic way just as it has been calculated for centuries we cannot give here details of all methods used but we can show why various functions have appeared in the lists of calculated integrals we begin with integer powers of x the integral of xn n 6 1 is found by differentiating xn 1 giving xn 1 n 1 constant for the integral this cannot give the integral of x 1 so we look at its graph there is an infinity at x 0 and the function is steadily increasing as x rises in x 0 and in x 0 it appears intuitively that if we keep away from x 0 the area under the curve from x 1 to x a 1 is a well defined function a a of a and similarly for the area under the curve from x 1 to x a in 0 a 1 if we move to x a h a 1 a a h a a lies between h times the least value of x 1 and h times the greatest value both between a and a h h a h a a h a a h a and similarly h a a a a a h h a h dividing by h and letting the positive h tend to 0 we have da dx 1 a x a to justify this argument we have to construct in some way the area under the curve more generally if we can construct the area under the curve y f x as f x with f having a special property called continuity then df dx f x and f is an integral assuming the construction for f x x 1 we write f x as loge x or ln x loge a ln a a 1 1 x dx a 1 where the symbols a 1 x 1 dx represent the value of the integral at x a minus the value of the integral at x 1 the usual calculus notation for the definite integral 7 in 12 if k a u k b v then for definite integrals v u h k dk b a h k x dk dx dx 13 keeping to x 0 if for some constant a 1 we have k x ax then for b 1 ab a 1 k dk b 1 1 ax a dx b 1 1 x dx as the variable of integration is irrelevant when the integral is an area we have loge ab loge a loge b a 1 b 1 14 taking loge 1 to be the integral from 1 to 1 zero area we define loge 1 to be 0 then when 0 a 1 or 0 b 1 or both we again have 14 and in particular loge 1 a loge a loge 1 a a loge 1 0 loge 1 a loge a loge an n loge a 15 for positive integers n by using 14 repeatedly and for negative integers n by also using the first part of 15 for n th roots a 1 n we have n loge a 1 n loge a 1 n n loge a n 6 0 and 15 is true for 1 n replacing n for p q replacing n and p q non zero integers loge a p q loge a p 1 q 1 q loge a p p q loge a if y loge x we write x exp y the exponential function from 14 15 exp a exp b exp a b exp 0 1 16 1 exp a exp a exp a n exp na n rational 17 we write e exp 1 so that for n rational a 0 b rational exp n exp 1 n en 18 ab exp loge a b exp b loge a 19 8 for b irrational or complex and a wider definition of exp we define ab as exp b loge a for differentiation 8 gives from y loge x d dy exp y 1 1 x x exp y d a x b x dx d dx exp b x loge a x a x b x b x loge a x b x a x a x 20 for those who know that the logarithm and exponential functions can be extended to functions of complex values with the above properties and who know the exponential forms of sin x and cosx we can with 1 write 1 1 x 2 1 x x 1 2 1 x 1 x a 0 1 1 x 2 dx 2 loge x loge x a 0 2 loge a a 1 2 loge 1 a 1 a y 1 a e 2 y 1 a a e y e y e y e y sin y cos y tan y a 0 1 1 x 2 dx arctan a thus we can now integrate all fixed powers of x and all polynomials finite sums of constants called coefficients times non negative integer powers of x for ratios of polynomial p x and q x these having no common factors we factorise the denominator q x q x xr x a s x b t r 0 s 0 t 0 where r s t are integers and where a b are the different real or com plex roots of q x 0 if the coefficients in q x are all real the complex roots occur in conjugate pairs a a i e for real m n and a m n then a m n and the power s of x a is the same as the power of x a the quadratic term with real coefficients 2 m m 2 n 2 x a x a x 2 a a x aa 9 is raised to the power s we now split up p x q x into partial fractions a polynomial in x plus fractions like constant x b t plus fractions like constant x 2 2 ux v w for real constants b u v and positive integers t w with v u 2 0 as the quadratic has no real roots the quadratic can be written x u 2 v u 2 the polynomial integrates easily and so do the first fractions involving logarithmic terms when t 1 while the second fractions involve arctan terms functions involving 1 y 2 with 2 y 1 for various y can usually be evaluated using y sin z or cos z and so on texts on the calculus show how to evaluate many integrals sometimes it is necessary to go further to elliptic functions and elliptic integrals involving the square roots of ax 3 bx 2 cx u and of ax 4 bx 3 cx 2 ux v the first type can be reduced to the second type by algebraic substitutions and the second type gives rise to legendre s normal forms elliptic integrals of the first second and third kind respectively i x 0 dx 1 x 2 1 k 2 x 2 ii x 0 1 k 2 x 2 1 x 2 dx iii x 0 dx x 2 a 1 x 2 1 k 2 x 2 all letters apart from x denote constants k being the modulus and usually we take 0 k 1 for w the

complex numbers omit this section if you are happy with your definition of real and complex numbers here we assume known the relations m n m n m n and the operations m n m n when m n and mn on them and their properties theorem 1 a non empty collection s however large of non negative inte gers contains a minimum say m with the property that n m for all n in s if there is an integer p such that n p for all n in s then s contains a maximum say q with n q for all n in s proof in the second part of the theorem p might be in s if not then p 1 might be in s if not then p 2 might be in s and so on eventually we arrive at the maximum q after at most p examinations of the contents of s similarly for the minimum for which we begin at 0 and proceed upwards the practical man calculates a real number using decimals to base 10 to his required accuracy we use the idea to define an infinite decimal x a sequence x 0 x 1 x 2 or xj of non negative integers and a set of rules writing x as x x 0 x 1 x 2 x 3 the first dot is the decimal point 0 xj 9 j 1 and x 0 is one of the sequence 0 1 2 105 as the base is 10 we can expect that 10 x 10 x 0 x 1 x 2 x 3 11 thus for the special repeated integer decimal y 0 999 10 y 9 999 9 y so y 1 and we have evaluated a special important decimal again for example we ought to have 0 246999 0 246000 0 000999 0 246000 0 999 103 0 247000 this is the background of the following rule for infinite decimals x x 0 x 1 x 2 x 3 and y y 0 y 1 y 2 y 3 we write x y and y x if xj yj all j or of for a particular integer j 1 xj 9 and yj 0 all j j while yj 1 xj 1 1 so xj 1 9 if j 2 and xj yj all j j 2 if any j is in the range thus x has a recurring 9 and y a recurring 0 after a certain stage we call y a finite decimal if neither of these two cases occur we write x 6 y for the given x let in x be the integer x 0 written in the usual way e g 105 followed by the integers x 1 x 2 xn in that order so that we could say that in x is the integer part of 10 nx for example i 2 1 234 123 if x 0 12 then i 2 x 0 345 1234 i 2 0 0123 001 written 1 and i 2 0 00123 000 written 0 the use of in saves many rules we write x y and y x if for some integer n ij x ij y j 0 1 2 n 1 but in x in y then im x im y for all m n it follows that if x y and y z then x z if we do not have x y nor x y then for some integer j ij x ij y 0 j j ij x ij y by definition y x x y thus if x y are two infinite decimals either x y or x y or x y we write x y y x if x y or x y so if x y is false then x y theorem 2 between any two unequal infinite decimals there is a finite dec imal proof let x x 0 x 1 x 2 x 3 y y 0 y 1 y 2 y 3 where neither x nor y has repeated 9 s form then for some integer j ij 1 x ij 1 y ij x ij y 12 omitting the i 1 when j 0 if ij x 2 ij y then ij z ij x 1 zj 0 j j will give a finite decimal z between x and y otherwise ij x 1 ij y and we look at the xj yj j j we can assume the most difficult case when y itself is a finite decimal as x does not have repeated 9 s form there is a first k j with xk 9 and then we take the finite decimal z between x and y with zj xj j k zk xk 1 9 zj 0 j k theorem 3 if x y are infinite decimals such that x y 10 n for all positive integers n then x y proof if x or y or both have repeated 9 s we first change to the equal repeated 0 s decimals then x x 0 x 1 x 2 y y 0 y 1 y 2 implies that there is an integer n 0 for which xj yj 0 j n xn yn for some integer j n yj 6 9 and then x y 10 j y 0 y 1 y 2 yj 1 yj 1 yj 1 contradicting xn yn hence x y a collection or set s of infinite decimals is empty if no infinite decimal is in s a rather trivial idea if one or more infinite decimals lie in s we say that s is non empty such a set is said to be bounded above by an infinite decimal y and y is an upper bound of s if x y for all x in s if no such y exists we say that s is unbounded above s is said to have a supremum or least upper bound u if u is an upper bound of s and if no nfinite decimal v u is an upper bound i e at least one member x of s lies in v x u going downwards instead of upwards we say that a non empty set s of infinite decimals is bounded below by an infinite decimal w and w is a lower bound of s if x w for all x in s s is said to have an infimum or greatest lower bound r if r is a lower bound and if no infinite decimal s r is a lower bound i e an x of s lies in s x r we are not symmetrical as all x 0 0 000 later we have symmetry on including negative infinite decimals as well 13 example 2 if y is an upper bound of s and if t y then t is an upper bound of s if w is an lower bound of s and if z w then z is an lower bound of s example 3 the set 1 2 3 4 is bounded above with upper bounds 4 5 75 23 etc if v 4 one member x of s is in v x 4 namely x 4 thus 4 is the supremum similarly 1 is the infimum generally if s is a finite set of infinite decimals the supremum is the maximum the greatest x in s and the infimum is the minimum the least x in s example 4 for infinite decimals a b the set s of all infinite decimals x in a x b is called a closed interval written a b as x b b is an upper bound of a b so is c if c b if u b an element x of a b is in u c b namely x b so b is the supremum similarly a is the infimum and both lie in a b there are three other kinds of intervals from a to b depending on whether or not each of a b lies in the interval the set of all infinite decimals x in a x b is called an open interval written a b here neither a nor b lies in the set so we use theorem 2 again b is an upper bound while if u a there is a finite decimal x in a x b with u x and u cannot be an upper bound if a u b then a finite decimal x lies in u x b so a x b and u cannot be an upper bound thus b is the supremum two half open or half closed intervals a x b written a b and a x b written a b also have supremum b and infimum a by using the above arguments appropriately example 5 the set of even positive integers 2 4 6 8 is not bounded above for if u u 0 u 1 u 2 is a supposed upper bound u 0 1 u and so is an upper bound either u 0 2 or u 0 3 is even equal to 2 n for an integer n and 2 n u so u is not an upper bound and the set is unbounded above theorem 4 a non empty set s of infinite decimals has an infimum r if s is bounded above then s has a supremum u each of r u can be in s or out of it see example 3 proof we prove the second part first changing all repeated 9 decimals to the equal finite decimals if for some infinite decimal y x y for all x in s then x 0 y 0 by theorem 1 the collection of integers x 0 for all x in s has a maximum u 0 with 0 u 0 y 0 we can now forget about y it has served its purpose let s 0 be the set of all x in s with x 0 u 0 then 14 those x have 0 x 1 9 and by theorem 1 the x 1 have a maximum u 1 in 0 u 1 9 let s 1 be the set of all x in s 0 with x 1 u 1 and so on this is a concealed induction in this way we define an infinite decimal u u 0 u 1 u 2 such a u with repeated 9 s is kept as it is until the proof ends by construction x u for all x in s and u is an upper bound let v v 0 v 1 v 2 u if v 0 u 0 each x in s 0 has v 0 x 0 u 0 v x u and v is not an upper bound if vj uj 0 j j but vj uj then each x in sj has vj xj uj 0 j j vj xj uj v x u and v is not an upper bound thus u is the supremum if necessary we now transfer from repeated 9 s to repeated 0 s replacing y by 0 and going upwards a similar construction gives the infimum we now add subtract multiply and divide infinite decimals if x y are infinite decimals let x y n and xy n be the infinite decimals with in u in x in y uj 0 j n i 2 n v in x in y vj 0 j 2 n then x y n and xy n rise with increasing n and both have suprema since x y n x 0 y 0 2 xy n x 0 1 y 0 1 and by theorem 4 thus in an obvious notation we define x y sup n x y n xy n sup n xy n note that x y n y x n xy n yx n so that x y y x xy yx if x y we define x y to be 0 if x y we define x y n to be w w 0 w 1 w 2 in w in x in y wj xj j n if x 0 there is a least integer n 0 with in x 0 and we write 1 x n 10 n n in n x obtained by division in the usual way of arithmetic as a finite or recurring infinite decimal recurring since after a finite stage the remainders are taken 15 from the non zero numbers 1 to in n x 1 and we follow the remainder by 0 and divide again at that stage if two remainders are the same these and the other remainders between the first and second recurrence will be repeated constantly the x y n 1 x n both fall with increasing n bounded below by 0 so that we take x y and 1 x to be the corresponding infima example 6 the numbers 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 can be written as a set of re curring infinite decimals that decrease steadily as j increases prove that 0 is the infimum the infinite decimals for x 10 n j 10 n n 1 2 are members of the given set by theorem 3 0 is the infimum of the set and as every x 0 0 is the infimum of the 1 j there are various algebraic rules concerning addition subtraction mul tiplication and division that could be considered at this point such as x y y x x y z x y z etc they could be put as exercises the most constructive way to define negative infinite decimals is probably to use ordered pairs x y of infinite decimals x y so that x y is different from y x we define a real number r to be a set of all ordered pairs x y for which u v in in r if and only if x v y u for some x y in r if x y then u x y v 0 satisfy the equation and we say that r is positive if x y then u 0 v y x satisfy the equation and we say that r is negative if x y then u 0 v satisfy and by the usual abuse of mathematical symbolism we write r as 0 if x y then r is positive or 0 and we call r non negative similarly if x y r is negative or 0 and we call r non positive for r the set of ordered pairs x y and t the set of ordered pairs u v we write r t r t r t respectively if and only if x v y u x v y u x v y u we have avoided the use of x y infinite decimal subtraction when x y the terms bounded above below supremum infimum can now be defined for collections of real numbers just as they were defined for infinite decimals 16 theorem 5 a non empty set s of real numbers bounded above by a real number has a supremum a non empty set s of real numbers bounded below by a real number has an infimum 4 proof we denote a supremum of s a set of real numbers or of infinite decimals by sup s an infimum by inf s for the first part if there are non negative real numbers in s let s be the set of all infinite decimals u with u 0 in r r in s and use theorem 4 second part if sup s 0 is in t then t sup s next if r 0 for all r in s we use the set s of all infinite decimals w with 0 w in r r in s with theorem 4 first part if 0 inf s is in t then t sup s similarly for theorem 5 second part or change every x y to y x and use theorem 5 first part sometimes we use the convention that if s is unbounded above then the supremum is if s is unbounded below it has the infimum we now have to deal with sequences a sequence is a function of the positive integers 1 2 n for some integer n called a finite sequence or a function of all positive integers called an infinite sequence thus 2 5 4 4 is a finite sequence while 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 n is an infinite sequence the general member of a sequence s is often written sn and the sequence itself is written sn theorem 6 the rational numbers ratios of integers can be put as a dis joint sequence proof every positive rational number occurs in the following sequence 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 3 2 2 3 1 1 4 2 3 3 2 4 1 1 5 there are groups of fractions p q this particular fraction lying in the p q 1 th group which contains p q 1 members in the group we begin with 1 p q 1 and continue by raising the numerator by 1 and lowering the denominator by 1 for each successive fraction till we reach p q 1 1 in 4 the conclusions in theorem 5 are called the dedekind property of the real numbers named after the german mathematician richard dedekind 1831 1916 who discovered it it is sometimes given as an axiom here we prove it from the construction 17 this first sequence every p q is repeated by np nq for n 2 3 hence we omit from the sequence every p q for which p and q have a common factor greater than 1 obtaining the sequence sn the final required sequence is then 0 s 1 s 1 s 2 s 2 theorem 7 the real numbers in 0 1 cannot all be put in sequence proof using the representation by repeated decimals that do not have the repeated 9 form let xn be a sequence of infinite decimals xn 0 xn 1 xn 2 xn 3 using cantor s diagonal process let y be given by the rule y 0 y 1 y 2 y 3 yn xnn 1 0 xnn 7 1 xnn 8 9 n 1 2 then no yn is 9 y cannot be a repeated 9 decimal and y cannot be in the sequence as it differs from xn in the nth decimal place if the original sequence contained all of the real numbers in 0 1 we would have a contradiction by induction we can find a second sequence disjoint from the first by replacing the original sequence by y x 1 x 2 x 3 to find a z disjoint from the new sequence and so on we have shown in some sense that the set of real numbers in 0 1 is larger than the set of all rationals in the former set closure we have a covering theorem the heine borel theorem also called borel s covering theorem or the borel lebesgue theorem as borel dealt with the case of a sequence of open sets and lebesgue the general case theorem 8 for b a let a b lie in the union of a family of open inter vals then the union of a finite number of intervals of contains a b proof first a lies in an interval of let s be the supremum of the set c of all points c in a c b such that a c lies in the union of a finite number of intervals of by theorem 5 s exists and a s b so there is an interval of that contains s say u v and u s v so that there is a c 18 in c and in u v to the finite number of intervals of covering a c we add u v so that a v is covered by a finite number by definition of s we cannot have s b so that s b we now go a stage further with ordered pairs z x y of real numbers which satisfy the usual algebraic laws of addition and multiplication together with a multiplication a b c d ac bd ad bc 0 1 0 1 1 0 we call z x y a complex number with real part x and imaginary part y we write x for x 0 for 0 1 y for 0 y and x y for z we define x y u v by x u y v it is enough to define x 0 0 0 written 0 then 0 x y x y x 2 y 2 0 x 2 y 2 0 x 0 y now let z x y w u v for x y u v real numbers then xu yv 2 x 2 u 2 y 2 v 2 2 xyuv x 2 y 2 u 2 v 2 xv yu 2 writing z as the non negative square root of the non negative number x 2 y 2 called the modulus of z we obtain xu yv z w with equality when z 0 or w 0 or z w is real from xv yu then z w 2 x u y v 2 x u 2 y v 2 z 2 w 2 2 xu yv z 2 w 2 2 z w z w z w 21 with equality when xu yv is non negative and the other conditions are true thus with equality when z 0 or z w is a positive real number 22 for t z w t w t w interchanging t and w and then replacing t by z we have z w z w 23 19 we can represent z x y by a point with co ordinates x y using rectan gular co ordinates in the plane if is the suitably measured angle between the line joining 0 0 and x y with the x axis then x r cos y r sin with r z and r the polar co ordinates of x y the angle is known as the amplitude or argument of z the question now arises of what use is this polar representation so we look at multiplication also let w u v with polar representation s then zw rs cos cos sin sin sin cos cos sin rs cos sin and the polar co ordinates of zw are rs we multiply the moduli and add the amplitudes and the second result gives a seeming connection with logarithms further developments will need sums of infinite series to

dedekind property of the real numbers named after the ger man mathematician richard dedekind 1831 1916 who discussed it some authors give the result as an axiom here we prove it from the infinite deci mal construction suprema and infima were discussed by r dedekind 1909 the rationals were put in sequence by g cantor 1875 who 1874 a showed that all real numbers could not be put in a single sequence e borel 1895 5 dienes was henstock s ph d supervisor p m 20 gave his covering theorem for a sequence of open sets see heine lebesgue gave the general case so theorem 8 is called the heine borel theorem or borel s covering theorem or the borel lebesgue covering theorem 3 2 cauchy riemann and darboux a l cauchy 1789 1857 systematized in cauchy 1821 the earlier defini tions and theorems of the constructive calculus integral his simplest con struction was for a closed bounded or compact interval a b of real numbers x in a x b where a b a partition of a b is a finite set of numbers x 0 x 1 x 2 xn satisfying a x 0 x 1 xn 1 xn b the mesh of the partition is the greatest of the xj xj 1 j 1 n for a function f defined everywhere in a b he took the limit as the mesh tends to 0 of the sum n j 1 f xj xj xj 1 f x 1 x 1 x 0 f x 2 x 2 x 1 f xn xn xn 1 in 1854 g f b riemann 1826 1866 gave a slight but significant general ization see riemann 1868 replacing f xj by f j where j is arbitrary in xj 1 xj j 1 n giving n j 1 f j xj xj 1 24 a sum very near to that of cauchy since if xj 1 j xj f j xj xj 1 f j j xj 1 f j xj j 25 f being evaluated at an end of the interval concerned not always at the right hand end applying 25 wherever necessary we have a partition with more points the sum 24 is called a riemann sum and its limit is called the riemann integral when the values of f are real j b darboux 1842 1917 in darboux 1875 gave a definition which most calculus integration texts now use he replaced f j by the supremum m xj 1 xj of the values of f in xj 1 xj to 21 get upper sums and replaced f j by the corresponding infimum m xj 1 xj to get lower sums for the graph of a positive f the upper sum is the sum of areas of rectangles with bases the xj 1 xj and heights just enough to include the graph for the lower sum the rectangles lie just below or on the graph as the mesh tends to 0 if upper and lower sums tend to the same finite limit it is the riemann darboux integral if the riemann darboux integral exists then f is bounded 26 an upper sum and a lower sum have to be finite so that the suprema and infima for the smaller intervals have to be finite the maximum of the finite number of suprema is the supremum of f on a b and the minimum of the infima is the infimum of f and f is bounded there is a bounded function with no riemann darboux integral 27 let f be 1 for rational numbers 0 otherwise finite decimals are rational numbers and lie in every interval in the positive real line by theorem 2 and in the negative real line by multiplying by 1 hence the supremum of f is 1 in every interval a non zero rational multiple of 2 is an irrational number so for p q we find a non zero rational r in p 2 q 2 r 2 is in p q and the infimum of f in p q is 0 all upper sums for a b are equal to b a all lower sums are 0 and the riemann darboux integral does not exist theorem 9 for f real valued over a b the riemann integral exists if and only if the riemann darboux integral exists with the same value and then f is bounded proof let the riemann darboux integral exist so f bounded there by 26 then m p q f x m p q a p x q b p q every riemann sum over a b lies between the corresponding upper and lower sums and the riemann integral exists with the same value conversely let the riemann integral exist with value i over a b then for small enough mesh all riemann sums s lie in i 1 1 then s n j 1 f j xj xj 1 f k xk xk 1 t 22 f k i 1 t xk xk 1 m xk 1 xk i 1 t xk xk 1 k 1 2 n finite where we have kept k and t fixed and varied k similarly m xk 1 xk is finite and f is bounded in a b as no real number v m p q can be an upper bound of the values of f in p q a b there is a in p q with f v given 0 we take p xj 1 q xj v m xj 1 xj j j 1 n s n j 1 m xj 1 xj xj xj 1 n j 1 m xj 1 xj b a similarly there are points j with xj 1 j xj j 1 n s n j 1 f j xj xj 1 n j 1 m xj 1 xj b a as the mesh tends to 0 both s and s tend to i so for small enough mesh the upper and lower sums lie in the closed interval centre i and length 2 2 b a as 0 is arbitrary the upper and lower sums tend to i and the riemann darboux integral exists equal to i the value of the riemann integral from theorem 9 and 27 the riemann integral cannot integrate all bounded functions when f is bounded and real valued in a b we define the upper riemann integral of f over a b to be the upper limit of riemann sums 24 over a b as the mesh tends to 0 as in theorem 9 this is the upper limit of upper sums over a b which can be called the upper riemann darboux integral written r b af dx similarly the lower riemann integral r b a f dx is the lower limit of 24 over a b as the mesh tends to 0 and is the lower limit of lower sums called the lower riemann darboux integral clearly the riemann integral exists if and only if f is bounded and the upper and lower riemann integrals are equal 23 theorem 10 let f be real valued and bounded in a c where a b c then r c a f dx r b a f dx r c b f dx r c a f dx r b a f dx r c b f dx 28 d a c r c a f dx r c a f dx d a b d b c 29 as b increases and as a decreases d a b is non negative and monotone increasing 30 if d a b 0 then d p q 0 for all p q a b 31 proof given 0 we take the riemann sums r 1 r 2 over a b b c respectively such that r 1 r b a f dx 3 r 2 r c b f dx 3 as r 1 r 2 is a riemann sum for a c and the meshes for a b b c and so a c are arbitrarily small we have r c a f dx r 1 r 2 3 r b a f dx r c b f dx c a f dx b a f dx c b f dx 32 for the opposite inequality take mesh p less than 8 n where f n in a c 0 v u p u b v and points u v u b b v so f v u f b u f v b 2 n v u 4 for the given p and a suitable riemann sum r 3 for a c r c a f dx r 3 4 r 4 r 5 2 r b a f dx r c b f dx 24 where r 4 and r 5 are the parts of r 3 given by intervals lying in a b b c respectively except that when an interval u v of the division over a c has u b v we split into u b and b v with f evaluated at b and distribute to r 4 r 5 accordingly hence the inequality opposite to 32 and so 28 first part similarly the second part then 29 30 31 since every d 0 theorem 11 the riemann integral of f over a b exists if and only if given 0 there is a 0 such that for every two divisions d d of a b with mesh less than d f t v u d f t v u 33 proof given 0 and the riemann integral i of f over a b let 0 be such that for all divisions d of a b with mesh less than i d f t v u 1 2 for d d divisions of a b with mesh less than and subtracting we have 33 conversely from 33 we prove integrability when 1 n let n and sn the sum over a division dn of a b with mesh less than n then for integers m n the meshes of dm and dn are less than n hence sn sm dn f t v u dm f t v u 1 n and sn is a fundamental and so convergent sequence with limit i say as m dn f t v u i 1 n as dn is any division with mesh less than n the riemann integral exists with value i not every calculus integral is a riemann integral 34 we show an unbounded derivative let f and its derivative f be f x x 2 sin 1 x 2 x 6 0 f 0 0 f x 2 x sin 1 x 2 2 x cos 1 x 2 x 6 0 25 the first term tends to 0 with x but the second term and f x oscillate unboundedly as x f x f 0 x x sin 1 x 2 0 x 0 f 0 0 thus the derivative exists for all x unbounded in any interval containing 0 and f has no riemann integral over such an interval theorem 12 darboux for a b let f be differentiable everywhere in a b with derivative f let f a q f b then for some in a b f q proof the differentiable f is continuous and therefore so is g with g x f x qx g x f x q its derivative by theorem g is bounded and obtains its infimum at a point a b as g a 0 g is falling at a and as g b 0 g is rising at b so the infimum cannot be at a nor at b and a b as g is the infimum of the values of g g h g g h g g h g h 0 g g h h 0 h 0 g 0 as g is the limit of both fractions as h 0 and f q similarly if f a q f b not every riemann integral is a calculus integral 35 the function f x 0 x 1 2 a b f x 1 x 1 2 a b has a riemann darboux integral over a b equal to b 1 2 a b 1 2 b a but in theorem 12 with q 1 2 there is no x with f x 1 2 and f is not a derivative in the whole of a b riemann 1868 art 5 shows that the necessary and sufficient condition for the riemann integral of a bounded function to exist over a b is that the total length of 26 the subintervals for which the oscillation is greater than any fixed positive number is arbitrarily small 36 we can rewrite the condition as follows given 0 in every partition the sum of lengths of those intervals for which the oscillation is greater than is a value which tends to 0 with the mesh 37 for the interval u v the oscillation is o u v m u v m u v 0 so that as the upper and lower sums tend to the same limit their difference tends to 0 with the mesh n j 1 o xj 1 xj xj xj 1 0 38 let be summation over those j for which o xj 1 xj and over the rest then xj xj 1 0 with the mesh thus the condition is necessary to show that it is sufficient for n the upper bound of f in a b and given 0 o xj 1 xj 2 n 0 nj 1 o xj 1 xj xj xj 1 2 n xj xj 1 xj xj 1 by the condition the first term tends to zero the second term is less than or equal to b a since 0 is as small as we please as the mesh tends to zero we have 38 thus f is riemann darboux and so riemann integrable note that we do not need the condition for all 0 it is enough to use a sequence of 0 decreasing to zero there is a bounded derivative that is not riemann integrable 39 27 this result goes beyond 34 but is far more complicated let xn be a sequence of numbers in 0 1 such that every interval in 0 1 contains an xn e g the finite decimals or the rationals in 0 1 let gn be the open interval xn 1 2 n 2 xn 1 2 n 2 and let g be the set of all points in all gn n 1 2 we call g the union of the gn and write g n 1 gn there is much overlapping so that the points of g do not have a simple formula even when the xn are finite decimals a point x g is a point of gn for some n and x xn 2 n 2 g let y be the supremum of all z with x z g now xn 1 so z 1 2 3 should be 1 2 n 2 p m y is finite and x y g while y g similarly there is a u g with u x g thus x u y g but we cannot enlarge u y in g beginning with g 1 let h 1 be the u y g 1 if gn has a point in common with h 1 then by construction gn h 1 let j be the least integer such that gj h 1 is empty and let h 2 be the u y gj u y g let k be the least integer such that gk has no point in common with h 1 nor with h 2 and so on thus we construct a sequence hm of disjoint open intervals with union g the hm are called connected components of g if hm u y then u y is an interval for small enough 0 and lies in hm and so lies in the union of some of the gn which are open intervals thus the heine borel theorem theorem 8 shows that u y is covered by a finite number of the gn hm taking 0 arbitrarily small y u 2 and so y u are bounded above by the sum of the lengths of the gn hm and the sum of lengths of all the hm is not greater than the sum of lengths of all the gn namely 1 2 let 0 a 0 a 1 ap 1 be a partition of 0 1 with b the sum of the lengths of all intervals aj 1 aj lying entirely within an hm or a union of abutting hm together with the common ends then b 12 the sum of the lengths of the other partition intervals which we can call black intervals is not less than 1 1 2 1 2 we arrange an oscillation of 1 on each of the hm so that 37 fails and f is not riemann integrable for each m let im be the closest interval symmetrically at the centre of hm with length equal to the square of the length of hm and let the function 28 f be continuous 1 at the centre of im and hm 0 at the ends of im always between 00 and 1 for m 1 2 and 0 outside the im then each black interval contains completely certain im since the original xn has points in every interval to show that f is a derivative we put j m x im 0 x by convention taking the integral 0 over the empty set let f x m 1 j m x f t dt if x g then for some p x hp and in a neighbourhood of x all terms of the sum for f are constant except possibly the term for m p thus for h 0 and h 0 d dx f x d dx j p x f t dt lim h 0 1 h x h x f t dt f x lim h 0 1 h x h x f t f x dt by continuity of f given 0 there is a 0 such that f t f x t x 1 h x h x f t f x dt h and the derivative of f is f x since 0 can be made arbitrarily small finally f x 0 when x g this is obvious when x is an endpoint of two hm otherwise let x be in the interval i 0 1 with i im not empty for some m let l k denote the length of the interval k with l 0 put sm l hm 12 as i contains at least that part of hm that lies on one side of im up to that end point of im l i hm 1 2 sm s 2 m 1 4 sm l i im l im s 2 m 16 l i hm 2 summing over the m with i im not empty l i im 16 l i hm 2 16 l i l i hm 16 l i 2 29 now 0 f 1 and f 0 in hm except in im if i x y or y x and k m x y i im m 1 k m x y f t dt m 1 l k m x y 16 l i 2 16 y x 2 f y f x y x 16 y x 0 as y x and f x 0 x g thus f f everywhere in 0 1 finishing the proof in the language of lebesgue and measure theory which appeared 30 years later than 36 this condition is that the bounded function is continuous almost everywhere 39 was first proved by volterra 1881 other examples followed the simplest being the excellent construction by goffman 1977 reproduced here in order to deal with even the calculus integration there is a need to go beyond riemann integration darboux s definition so useful in practice is a barrier against generalizations such as the gauge integral so that in the next two sections we consider definitions extending riemann integration before we deal with the gauge integral historically they appeared more than ten years after the gauge integral example 7 evaluate lim j 1 j 2 1 2 j 2 4 j j 2 j 2 university of ulster 1986 m 112 hint write the expression inside as a sum of

extend it to infinite intervals beginning with a the set of all real numbers x a the obvious definition of the integral was used for centuries being a f dx lim b b a f dx 40 and systematized by cauchy 1823 lec 24 see also de la valle e poussin 1982 a b proofs of some properties of such an integral the limit of the limit of riemann sums so a double limit are difficult the limit process 31 given here is easier to handle while a more general limit process is given in section 4 1 if a x 0 x 1 x 2 xn 1 xn b 41 are real numbers the finite collection of xj 1 xj j 1 2 n has been called a partition p of a b and the greatest of the xj xj 1 the mesh p of p a collection of interval point pairs xj 1 xj j is a division d of a b based on p if xj 1 j xj j 1 2 n 42 given a function f defined on a b the riemann sum for d and f is n j 1 f j xj xj 1 d f v u 43 where u v denotes the interval and the associated point in the second sum let r be the class of all real valued functions on a riemann in tegrable over a b for each b a such that the finite limit in 40 exists a real valued function g 0 strictly decreasing on 0 b for some b 0 is called a regulating function if g x increases without bound tends to infinity as x tends to 0 through positive values x tends to 0 from above x 0 a function f on a is said to be regulated by g if g is a regulating function and if a number i satisfies the following condition for each bn a of a sequence strictly increasing to infinity each sequence pn of partitions pn of a bn with pn 0 0 bn g pn 0 as n each sequence dn of divisions dn based on pn with riemann sum rn for dn and f then rn i as n theorem 13 if f is regulated by g for a then f is riemann integrable over a b for each b a and the integrals tend to a finite limit as b proof if f is regulated by g and if p n pn n 1 2 then 0 bn g p n bn g pn 0 32 as n and we can take n 0 bn g n 0 pn n taking rn within 2 n of r bn a f dx as rn i r bn a f dx i and similarly r bn a f dx i and the difference d a bn 0 between the integrals tends to 0 as n but by 30 d a bn is monotone increasing in n hence every d a bn 0 and by 30 again d a b 0 b a f is riemann integable over a b for every b a and the riemann integral for b bn tends to i as bn is an arbitrary strictly increasing sequence tending to infinity it follows that the riemann integral over a b tends to i as b which is 40 with i as the value of the integral over a thus theorem 13 is proved clearly we have similar results for the integral over a b when a haber and shisha 1974 p 3 states that every f in r i e real valued f riemann integrable over a b for every b a with 40 true is regulated by some regulating function g i have not been able to prove this for some f we need not use regulating functions we say that f is simply integrable over a if there is a number i such that given 0 there are numbers b a 0 with the property that if b b and p is a partition of a b with p and r is a riemann sum for f based on p then r i thus f is simply integrable if the riemann sums using partitions p of a b tend to a unique finite limit when b and p 0 simultaneously as above f is in r theorem 13 a more complicated definition involves the difference between the upper sum and the lower sum for a partition p of an interval a b written o f p a function f is said to satisfy the uniform riemann condition if given 0 there is a f independent of b a such that if p is a partition of a b then p f implies o f p 44 given 0 there are a b f a and a f 0 such that whenever b b b f and p is a partition of b b p f and r is any riemann sum for f based on p then r 45 33 if we weakened this condition by letting to depend on b and to depend on b b then 44 would give the darboux condition for riemann integrability over a b and all b a and 45 would then give the cauchy convergence condition to ensure 13 namely that the difference between the integral over a b and the integral over a b tends to 0 as b theorem 14 a function f is simply integrable if and only if f satisfies the uniform riemann condition proof to show that a simply integrable function f satisfies the uniform riemann condition given 0 let b be as in the first definition by theorem 13 f is riemann integrable on a b so that there is a 0 such that if p is any partition of a b with p then o f p if a b b and p any partition of a b with p then might not at first sight be small enough to ensure the required inequality we use a simple special argument to obtain what we require let r r be riemann sums for a b and based on p and let r be a riemann sum for b b then r r and r r are two riemann sums for a b and so for the corresponding partition p of a b arranged to have p r r r r r r o f p o f p o f p let min 0 if b a and p a partition of a b with p then o f p when b b when b b every riemann sum r using f and based on p satisfies r a f dx o f p 2 on taking r near to the upper sum and then near to the lower sum and we have 44 on replacing by 2 then f in r gives 45 conversely if the uniform riemann condition holds so does the weak condition and f is in r put i a f dx given 0 let b f f be as in the definition of the uniform riemann condition with replaced by 3 and f 1 put b b f 1 if b b let the partition p of a b be given by a x 0 x 1 xn b p f 1 34 let m be the greatest integer such that xm b and let p 1 be the partition of a xn by points x 0 x 1 xn for the riemann sum r based on p let r 1 be the sum of the first m terms of r since p 1 so that xm b f 45 implies that i xm a f dx 3 r r 1 3 and 44 implies that r 1 xm a f dx 3 thus we prove the theorem from r i clearly all these results can be given for b the set of all x in x b using b f dx lim a b a f dx and for the complete real line using f dx lim a lim b b a f dx 3 4 an infinity of a function in a bounded interval the next step in extending riemann s integral is to integrate over a point where a function has an infinity for example the integral of f x 1 x x 1 2 in x 0 is x 1 2 1 2 constant 1 f x dx 2 2 12 0 1 avoiding the infinity at x 0 as gets smaller and smaller shrinks so does 1 2 and the integral tends to 2 usually we define the integral 1 0 f dx lim 0 1 f dx 46 if the limit exists in the present case it gives 2 for the integral over 0 1 in other words we assume that the integral is continuous at 0 where the infinity 35 of f occurs this was systematised by cauchy 1821 lec 25 we can replace 0 1 by a b with a b real and b a f dx lim 0 b a f dx b a f dx lim 0 b a f dx 47 in 46 and 47 as in 40 the integral is defined by a double limit to avoid this we first use the dominated integral of osgood and shisha 1976 b 1977 and lewis and shisha 1983 which is defined for the interval 0 1 in section 4 2 we will go further let f be a real or complex valued function on 0 1 the dominated integral of f over 0 1 is a number i having the following property given 0 there exist in 0 1 0 1 such that i n j 1 f j tj tj 1 48 whenever 0 t 0 t 1 tn 1 t 0 tj 1 j tj tj 1 t j 1 j 1 2 n theorem 15 if f is complex valued on 0 1 and has a dominated integral i over 0 1 then f the real part of the value of f has a dominated integral i and f the imaginary part of the value of f has a dominated integral i proof these follow from 48 since for complex z i n j 1 f j tj tj 1 i n j 1 f j tj tj 1 z z z z theorem 16 let f have a dominated integral in 0 1 then f satisfies the riemann condition for f namely that f is defined on 0 1 and bounded on 1 and riemann integrable for each in 0 1 and that given 0 there is a in 0 1 such that for a b the oscillation of f in a b osn j 1 f t 0 t 1 tn n j 1 o tj 1 tj tj tj 1 49 36 whenever 0 t 0 t 1 tn 1 tj 1 t 1 j 1 t 0 conversely if f satisfies the riemann condition for f then f has a dominated integral in 0 1 proof the only restraint on j is that tj 1 j tj if f is real valued we choose j so that f j is as near as we like to its supremum while keeping the other k fixed and still have the same inequality hence the supremum of the values of f in tj 1 tj is finite being true for j 1 2 n in turn we see that f is bounded above in t 0 1 similarly f is bounded below in t 0 1 and so is bounded there and t 0 can be arbitrarily small further by the same argument we can replace each f j in 48 by its supremum and also by its infimum on incurring the slight penalty for each of replacing by taking the difference between the two inequalities and using the oscillation o tj 1 tj of section 3 2 we have 49 with replaced by 2 for complex valued f we first use theorem 15 and so obtain 49 with 2 and with o tj 1 tj the oscillation first of f and then of f respectively o 1 and o 2 for a f j f j b f j f j a b a b o 1 o 2 sup f j f j o 1 o 2 the supremum is now the oscillation of f in tj 1 tj so that we have 49 except for 4 in place of all we need to do now is to replace the original by 5 to obtain 49 exactly to show that f is riemann integrable over 1 for each in 0 1 we need only observe that the condition tj 1 t 1 j 1 is the same as tj 1 tj tj tj tj 1 tj 50 so that each partition of 1 with mesh less than tj can be used with a suitable partition of 0 that satisfies the conditions and thus for two partitions of 1 of mesh less than and the same partition of 0 the difference between the two values between the modulus signs in 48 has modulus less than 2 in this difference the two values of i cancel and so does that part of the sum from the partition of 0 leaving sums over partitions of 1 alone the modulus of such difference being less than 2 hence the riemann integral over 1 exists see theorem 12 thus the first part of theorem aref 2 4 2 is proved to prove that if f satisfies the riemann condition for f then f is dom inated integrable we note that 49 is given subject to the conditions on tj 37 4 gauge integration 4 1 basic ideas in section 3 4 50 shows that in p if the constant is replaced by x c x a a x b a 0 51 for some constant c 0 we have the dominated integral of osgood and shisha 1976 b 1977 see lewis and shisha 1983 thus when f is unbounded near to a we replace b a f x dx lim c a r b c f dx 52 by a single limit similarly when trouble occurs on the left of b in a b we use x c b x a x b b 0 53 for some constant c 0 to replace the double limit b a f x dx lim c b r c a f dx 54 by a single limit there could be many such difficulties in a b making a suitable very elaborate to deal with such a case we look at the recovery of a function f the primitive from its known derivative f such an f is not unique since for any constant c the derivative of f c is also f as f is otherwise unique theorem c follows from the value of f at a single point looking at the definition of a derivative if at a point x we have an error less than 0 in the computation of the derivative f of f then we have the inequality f x h f x h f x 55 for h positive and negative and tending to 0 but never 0 the fraction tends to f x so that for some range of values of h say 0 h the inequality is true for some points x sometimes large values of 0 will suffice while at other points has to be very small so we take as a function of x as in 51 53 naturally also depends on 0 but we do not write x usually since and are normally not far apart 6 6 one could call and the heavenly twins of analysis 38 rewriting 55 with h u x f u f x u x f x u x u x 0 x u x 56 thus f u f x and f x u x differ by a value with modulus less than u x if 56 holds at all points x of the interval a b with u also in a b and if we can fit together a finite number of such intervals u x x u without overlapping to cover a b exactly we can build up f b f a by splitting it into terms f x f u f u f x replacing them by f x x u f x u x respectively and have a riemann sum of such terms the error is at most the sum of the separate terms in 56 namely b a these remarks lead us to gauge integration to which we now turn theorem 17 given real numbers a b and an arbitrary function x 0 at each point x of a b there are a finite number of points a u 0 u 1 un b called a partition of a b and a finite number of points x 1 xn such that xj uj or xj uj 1 and that uj 1 uj lies in xj xj xj xj j 1 2 n such an arrangement of the interval point pairs uj 1 uj xj is called a fine division d of a b based on p proof as a b are finite by the heine borel lebesgue covering theorem theorem 8 a finite number of open intervals i x x x x x covers a b i e each point of a b lies in one or more of the finite number of intervals i x some points might be covered by three or more of the i x causing difficulties in finding a division so we first remedy the situation taking the largest of the i x with equal x we can arrange that each point of a b lies in at most two of the i x 57 first suppose that with a u v w b i u i v i w have a common point when v v u u v u v u u v v v u u u 39 i u is contained in i v and omitting i u will not remove the cover sim ilarly if v v w w then i w is contained in i v and can be omitted otherwise as all three intervals have a common point if u u v v v v w w the union of i u and i w contains i v which can be omitted without breaching the cover putting the intervals in a finite sequence and dealing in turn with each interval which meets two other intervals we have 57 ending with the centres satisfying a x 1 x 2 xn b the i xj being consecutive with a in i x 1 b in i xn and i xj overlap ping with i xj 1 the intersection containing points of xj xj 1 all three intervals being open their intersection is an open interval in which we choose a point yj j 1 2 n 1 the points a x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 yn 1 xn b divide a b into non empty fine closed intervals with the points xr the centres of the open intervals of the cover giving a fine division of a b as required by theorem 17 we can now define the gauge riemann complete gen eralized riemann or kurzweil henstock integral f a b of the finite valued function f in a b a b finite a number f a b is the gauge integral of f on a b when for each 0 there is a function 0 the gauge on a b duch that for every fine division d of a b d f x v u f a b 58 here d denotes the sum over the d with general term u v x by 56 if f is the finite derivative of a function f on a b with a finite right hand derivative at a and a finite left hand derivative at b we have gauge integration of f with integral f a b f b f a thus solving the problem of integrating finite derivatives on a b f can be real valued or complex valued it does not cause any problem that 56 finishes with an error term 40 over d of b a for we can replace the original 0 by b a 0 so that we end with the error 0 the integration of finite derivatives is the first example of the power of the gauge integral as theorem 17 is the central theorem in gauge integration we examine it further theorem 18 the existence of fine divisions of a b for each function 0 on a b is equivalent to the heine borel lebesgue covering theorem for a b proof by theorem 17 we need only show that the existence implies the covering theorem let a b be covered by a collection c of open intervals with centres x in a b for each such x let x k x k be one of the intervals in c and let the function 0 on a b be k at x if x in a b is not the centre of an interval of c then as c covers a b x lies in an interval of c and so is in an open interval x k x k lying in that interval here we take x to be this k so defining in a b by the existence of fine divisions of a b there is such a division consisting of ij xj say and for jj xj xj xj xj each jj is a kj of c or lies in an interval kj of c by the fineness the kj form a cover of a b and they form a finite subset of c hence the covering theorem the kind of proof of theorem 8 borel proves theorem 17 easily second proof of theorem 17 let t in a t b be such that a t has a fine division and let s be the supremum of such t then for a t a a a t has a t a as a fine division to which we add t s s if t s and s w s for some w in s w s s if s b in this case a w has a fine division with w s a contradiction implying s b and then the fine division of a b given two gauges 1 x 0 2 x 0 on a b we often replace them by a third gauge 3 x 0 so that every 3 fine division has the properties of a j fine division j 1 2 thus 3 x 1 x 3 x 2 x and we can use 3 min 1 2 3 x min 1 x 2 x 0 the first use of this simple device is to show the integral unique 41 theorem 19 let f be finite on a b with a b if g and h are two values of the gauge integral of f on a b then g h proof in 58 let the gauges for f a b g h be 1 2 with 3 min 1 2 then g h d f x v u h d f x v u g d f x v u h d f x v u g 2 for a 3 fine division d of a b as both results are true by theorem 3 and arbitrary 0 g h 0 g h and f a b is unique whenever it exists theorem 20 for real numbers a b let f g be defined on a b with con stants if f g have respective gauge integrals f g on a b then f g has gauge integral f g there proof as in 58 let the gauges for f g be 1 0 2 0 with 3 min 1 2 then d f x g x v u f g d f x v u f d f x v u g for a 3 fine division of a b hence the result by choice of 0 1 0 2 0 theorem 21 in theorem 20 for f g real valued and f g everywhere in a b then f g proof in theorem 20 for every 0 and a suitable d depending on f d f x v u d g x v u g f g 2 by theorem 3 we have f g 0 f g when f is complex valued we have a partial converse of theorem 20 42 theorem 22 for real numbers a b and f complex valued and integrable over a b then so are its real and imaginary parts integrable and conversely proof let f g h be integrable to g h over a b with g x h x g h real valued then d g x v u g d g x v u g d h x v u h d f x v u g h and similarly for h h and g h are integrable to g h respectively the converse follows from theorem 20 with 1 corresponding to fundamental sequences we have similarities here theorem 23 for real numbers a b and given a finite function f on a b and for each 0 a gauge 0 depending on such that every two fine divisions d d of a b satisfy d f x v u d f x v u 59 then f is integrable over a b proof taking 2 j let be j 0 j min 1 2 j 0 then a j fine division of a b is a j fine division and a k fine division if k j for some j fine division dj of a b let sj dj f x v u then in 59 we can take 1 2 j d dj d dk k j sj sk 1 2 j and sj is a fundamental sequence so convergent to some limit say s as k sj s 1 2 j 60 in 59 we now take d dj and d an arbitrary j fine division of a b and 60 d f x v u s 1 2 j 1 given 0 there is always an integer j with 21 j and so f is integrable over a b 43 theorem 24 if p q a b a b with f integrable over a b then f is integrable over p q to f q f p where f p p a f dx p a f a 0 proof a b p q a p q b where a p or q b or both can be empty and there is no division over an empty set given 0 let 0 on a b be such that d f x v u f b 61 for all fine divisions d of a b for d 1 d 2 d 3 d 4 fine divisions of a p q b p q p q respectively taking dj empty if over an empty set then d 1 d 2 d 3 and d 1 d 2 d 4 are fine divisions of a b so that by 51 d 3 f x v u d 4 f x v u d 1 d 2 d 3 f x v u f b f b d 1 d 2 d 4 f x v u 2 62 hence by theorem 23 f is integrable over p q and in 62 we can let d 4 f x v u q p f dx d 3 f x v u q p f dx 2 63 this last is the same for all p q a b and all fine divisions d 3 of p q a uniformity hence if a p q r b as a fine division d 3 of p q and a fine division d 5 of q r give a fine division d 3 d 5 of p r while the sums add r p f dx q p f dx r q f dx r p f dx d 3 d 5 q p f dx d 3 r q f dx d 5 6 as the values of the integrals do not depend on 0 the first modulus is 0 and r p f dx q p f dx r q f dx we say that the integral is finitely additive for p a the last integral is f r f q clearly we have a vital theorem going inwards to intervals inside a b going outwards 44 theorem 25 if a b c with f integrable over a b and b c then f is integrable over a c to the sum of the other two integrals proof let us take x 1 x 2 x such that x 1 2 x b x 6 b 8 b 1 then d 1 f x v u f 1 1 2 d 2 f x v u f 2 1 2 f 1 b a f dx f 2 c b f dx for every 1 fine division d 1 of a b and every 2 fine division d 2 of b c we take 0 x min x 1 x a x b min b 1 b 2 b x b min x 2 x b x c by theorem 17 there is a fine division d of a c by construction of the intervals u v with b in u v and u v x in d have x b u or v as no other interval can reach b if v b then u b a b and u b b is 1 fine if u b then b v b c and b v b is 2 fine thus d can be split up into a 1 fine d 1 over a b and a 2 fine d 2 over b c and d f x v u f 1 f 2 d 1 f x v u f 1 d 2 f x v u f 2 being true for every 0 and every suitable 0 f is integrable over a c to f 1 f 2 theorem 26 let intervals ij uj 1 uj j 1 2 n where a u 0 b un form a partition p of a b then there is a gauge on a b such that every fine division d of a b is a refinement of p i e if i x is in d then i ij for some j in 1 2 n 45 proof we take 0 2 x min uj x x uj 1 uj 1 x uj j 1 2 n min uj uj 1 uj 1 uj x uj j 2 3 n 1 0 2 a u 1 a 0 2 b b un 1 by theorem 17 there is a fine division d of a b formed of interval point pairs u v x with x u or x v if uj 1 x uj then u v cannot include uj 1 nor uj by the inequalities and u v ij if x uj then x is smaller than the distances from uj to uj 1 if any and to uj 1 if any so that u v lies in ij or in ij 1 hence the theorem people call the next theorem the henstock lemma or the saks henstock lemma we reserve the second name for 65 and call 66 the kolmogorov saks henstock lemma theorem 27 let f integrable over a b a b and given 0 let x 0 on a b be such that for all fine divisions d of a b b c then f is integrable over a c to the sum of the other two integrals d f x v u f a b f u v v u f dx 64 if d 1 d then d 1 f x v u f u v 65 d f x v u f u v 4 66 proof theorem 24 shows that for f a a 0 f a x x a f dx f u v exists equal to f a v f a u and we can write 64 in the form d f x v u f u v 67 for those u v x ind d 1 we can replace each u v x by a fine division d u of u v and still have a fine division of a b to replaced in 64 letting each such d u f x v u f u v 46 we replace each such f x v u f u v in 67 by 0 and have 65 in the original d with f real valued we take d 1 the terms in d with f x v u f u v 0 and d d 1 the rest then 65 twice gives 66 with 2 on the right if f is complex valued by theorem 22 the result holds with the real part of f and with the imaginary part of f giving 4 on the right of 66 the latter result shows how near the integral is to some of its riemann sums in a rather deeper way than 64 and it leads to the idea of variation divisions are finite sets of interval point pairs i x let h i x be a function of such interval point pairs for example h i x f x mi f i i u v mi v u 68 given a gauge on a b let v h a b sup d d h i x the supremum of the sums over fine divisions d of a b the variation v h a b of h in a b is defined to be v h a b inf v h a b lim sup 0 d h i x the infimum being taken over all gauges on a b if v h a b is finite we say that h is of bounded variation over a b if v h a b 0 we say that h is of variation zero over a b thus 66 states that for the given conditions 68 is of varia tion zero over a b two interval point functions h i x k i x are variationally equivalent if h k is of variation zero thus in 66 f x mi and f i are variationally equivalent if x is a set on the real line with indicator x x equal to 1 if x is in x and to 0 if x is not in x we write respectively v h a b x and v h a b x for v h x a b v h x a b do not confuse v h a b x with v h x these have a b in different places and the second v has the greek letter if v h a b x is finite we say that h is of bounded variation in x relative to a b while if v h a b x 0 we say that h is of variation 0 47 in x relative to a b we say that a property is true h almost everywhere h a e if it is true except in a set x with v h a b x 0 such a set x is said to be of h variation zero sometimes p p presque partout replaces a e if h u v x v u we usually omit the h from h variation h a e etc theorem 28 if h k are variationally equivalent in a b then for each set x on the real line even if one side is v h a b x v k a b x 69 if v h a b 0 and if u v a b then v h u v 0 if v h a b x 0 and if y x then v h a b y 0 70 let f x be integrable over a b with integral f i i a b then f x is integrable over a b if and only if f is of bounded variation over a b 71 proof in 69 h k has variation zero hence h k x x has variation zero since the sum over a division d of h k x x has the same or fewer terms than the sum for h k using the inequalities h h k k k h k h and given 0 there is a gauge on a b with v h k a b x v h a b x v h a b x v h k a b x v k a b x v k a b x v h a b x v h a b x as 0 and so 0 even when one side is interchanging h and k gives equality in 70 we have the same or fewer terms in sums over u v as for over a b since the closure of a b u v is covered by fine divisions and similarly for y replacing x v h u v v h a b v h a b y v h a b x 48 in 71 let f be integrable to k over a b then given 0 there is a gauge on a b such that for all fine divisions d of a b with h i x f x mi k d f x v u k k v h a b k k v h a b k so b a f dx k v h a b and k is finite by 69 v f a b v h a b finite conversely if f is integrable to f of bounded variation over a b 66 implies that for any fine divisions d of a b d f i tends to a finite limit in a b to the same limit but f is finitely additive so that if d is a division of u v then f u v d f i d f i and sums of f rise or stay the same under subdivision as f is of bounded variation in a b sums of f over a b are bounded by v f a b if 0 there is a division d with v f a b d f i v f a b 72 by theorem 26 for some gauge in a b every fine division of a b is a refinement of this d and so its sum of f also lies within the same bounds as in 72 as 0 is arbitrary v f a b is the limit of sums f as 0 and f is integrable to v f a b over a b theorem 29 if h is an interval point function on a b and if xj is a sequence of sets on the real line with union x then v h a b x j 1 v h a b xj 73 if v h a b x 0 with f a finite valued point function on a b then v fh a b x 0 conversely if v fh a b x 0 and if x 0 is the set where f 6 0 then v h a b x x 0 0 74 49 proof in 73 if some xj have points in common and if we remove the common points from the xj with the larger j obtaining disjoint x j the union x is the union of the x j and we need only prove 73 for the x j replacing the x j by the xj will not lower the sum so that we can assume the xj disjoint further we take the tight hand side finite or there is nothing to prove given 0 let the gauge j on a b be such that v h j a b xj v h a b xj 2 j j 1 2 75 we take the gauge to satisfy x j x x xj j 1 2 1 x x 76 if d is a fine division of a b and if dj is the subset of the i x in d with x in xj then as d is only a finite set there is an integer m with dj empty for j m by 75 d h i x x x m j 1 dj h i x m j 1 v h j a b xj j 1 v h a b xj v h a b x j 1 v h a b xj as 0 and 0 we have 73 thus if each xj has h variation zero so has x if x has h variation zero and if f is a finite valued point function let xj be the set of all x in x with j 1 f x j j 1 2 then by 70 xj has h variation zero and v fh a b xj jv h a b xj 0 v fh a b x j 1 jv h a b xj 0 50 conversely f 1 exists in x 0 so that if v fh a b x 0 then v h a b x x 0 v f 1 fh a b x x 0 0 by 70 and the first part theorem 30 the integral f u v of fh over u v is 0 for all u v a b b a or for all u v a b or for a b alone when fh 0 if and only if f 0 in a b except for a set x in a b with v h a b x 0 proof if f a v 0 for all v in a v b then f u v f a v f a u 0 a u v b by 66 given 0 there is a gauge such that for all fine divisions d of a b d f x h i x 4 v fh a b 4 v fh a b 0 66 finishes the proof conversely v fh a b 0 so that for 0 a gauge 0 exists such that for all fine divisions d of u v a b d fh 0 d fh and f u v exists and is 0 in case fh 0 with f a b 0 then for 0 there is a gauge such that for all fine divisions d of a b d fh d fh 0 v fh a b 0 and the rest of the proof follows theorem 31 if u v a b and h i x is defined over a b then v h u v v h a b 77 for a b c with h i x defined over a c then v h a b v h b c v h a c 78 51 proof as a b u v is one or two intervals we take divisions over their closure adding to a division of u v we have a division of a b sums over the various divisions not of a b add together to give a sum over a b which is not greater than v h a b for fine divisions as 0 we prove 77 thus in 78 if either of v h a b v h b c is the result is true so we can assume both variations finite and given 0 and each 1 we take some 1 fine division d 1 over a b d 1 h i x v h a b and similarly for b c and 2 and d 2 as in the proof of theorem 25 we construct over s b and can then replace 1 2 by for some fine d 1 d 2 we have d 1 d 2 h v h a b v h b c 2 v h a c v h a b v h b c to prove the opposite inequality and so 78 given 0 and 0 0 there is always a 0 fine division d of a b with d h v h a c 79 as in theorem 25 we construct from 0 1 in a b and 0 2 in b c with a fine division d satisfying 79 which by the construction can be split up into a fine division d 1 of a b and a fine division d 2 of b c with v h a b v h b c d 1 h d 2 h v h a c as 0 we prove the opposite inequality and so 78 thus the variation is finitely additive it is also an outer measure in lebesgue theory theorem 29 the next property needing a regular outer measure though not needed here theorem 32 let xn be a monotone increasing sequence of sets in a b with h i x defined there then lim n v h a b xn v h a b lim n xn 80 52 proof as x limn xn contains xj v h a b xj v h a b x lim n v h a b xn v h a b x 81 thus if the limit is a conventional the result is true if the limit is finite we prove the opposite inequality to 81 for let the gauges n x x in a b satisfy v h n a b xn v h a b xn 2 n 0 n 1 2 3 82 x n x x xn xn 1 n 1 2 x 0 empty 1 x x if d is a fine division of a b and if d d n are the subsets of d with the x in x and in xn xn 1 respectively n 1 2 3 there is a greatest integer m depending on d such that d m is not empty remember that d contains only a finite number of i x let ej be the union of the u v with u v x d j and let fj be the unio of the u v with u v x d d j then by theorem 31 78 v h ej xj v h fj xj v h a b xj v h ej xj v h a b xj 2 j v h fj xj v h ej xj 2 j d h x x d h m j 1 d h m j 1 v h ej xj m j 1 v h ej xj 2 j m j 1 v h ej xm v h a b xm v h a b x v h a b x lim j v h a b xj 53 giving the opposite inequality to 81 as 0 and hence 80 example 11 if f g almost everywhere in a b b a and the integral f of f exists over a b then g is integrable to f over a b hint consider the integral of f g and use theorem 30 example 12 if f u v v u f dx then b a g df b a gf dx provided one side exists to ensure that the integral using df is of the type defined in 58 we assume that f a x is strictly increasing in x taking all values between its minimum and maximum in a b or we can define the integral of h i x by replacing f x v u in 58 by h u v x this gives the integration by substitution of the calculus the second proof of theorem 1 is in henstock 1955 p 277 with extra reference to rationals gauge integration unnamed first appeared there followed independently by kurzweil 1957 lemma 1 1 1 p 423 here the proof is the first proof of theorem 17 a proof for rectangles was found by j mawhin in p cousin 1895 p but with no reference to integration much of this section s theory first appeared in henstock 1963 with a 25 year update in henstock 1988 4 2 the cauchy and harnack extensions and integra tion over infinite intervals if the singularities of a function form a complicated set constructions of the type given in section 3 4 become very intricate however if one extends the gauge integral similarly the resulting integral is still the gauge integral we have not found anything new this is shown in theorem 33 for the case of a singularity at c the gauge integral existing over a b for all b in a b c for a singularity at a with the function integrable over b c for all b in a b c there is a similar theorem with the integral over b c tending to a limit as b a if the singularity occurs between a and b we split the interval at the singularity and use both results effectively we are illustrating the continuity of the integral with respect to its endpoints of the range of x 54 so far the gauge integral has been defined over finite intervals a b we need a slightly different definition for an interval of infinite length and a proof like that of theorem 33 is needed to connect with cauchy s definition such results can be called cauchy extensions remembering cauchy 1823 lecs 24 25 in his very detailed construction of the integral of a derivative denjoy used repeatedly the cauchy extensions together with an extension of harnack and this section finishes with a proof that the harnack extension also is contained in the gauge integral theorem 33 let f be finite over a c for real numbers a c and let the gauge integral f b of f over a b exist for all b in a b c if f b g as b c then f is gauge integrable over a c with value g conversely if f c exists so does f b for a b c and f b f c as b c proof let bj c c a 2 j j 0 1 2 we are given that for j 0 f bj exists so that by theorem 24 the integral f bj f bj 1 exists over bj bj 1 bj hence given 0 there is a gauge j x in bj for which every j fine division dj over bj satisfies dj f x v u f bj f bj 1 2 j 1 if bj 1 w bj with d a j fine division of bj 1 w then by theorem 3 1 11 65 the saks henstock lemma d f x v u f w f bj 1 2 j 1 f x g 2 c c x c for small c 0 also let x j x bj 1 x bj bj min j bj j 1 bj j 1 2 c 1 b 0 by this construction we have in a c divisions d 1 dj 1 d and interval point pair w c c forming a fine division d of a c for which d f x v u g 83 55 to ensure that every fine division of a c is a division of type d we only have to arrange that the division refines the partition b 1 bj 1 bj 1 w w c by theorem 26 with thus by 83 f is gauge integrable over a c to g for the converse we use theorems 24 27 65 with d 1 consisting of a single interval point pair w c c turning to the definition of a division over x a for some real number a the infinite integral being written a we begin by taking some real number b a and fine divisions of a b the controller of the fineness of divisions of a b is a neighbourhood of each x in a b u v x is fine if u v x x x x x u or x v this hints at how we may define fineness over a using a suitable neighbourhood of the conventional remembering that no real number is greater than for some real number b a we use a one sided open interval with x b written b b being fine if b b the rest of the division of a is a fine division of a b the riemann sum for the fine division of a and for a point func tion f over a is obtained by taking the conventional f and f b to be 0 to give a continuous integral at and then adding the riemann sum over a b using these riemann sums over finite intervals we can have a direct definition of the integral over a infty the interval of x satisfying x b for some real number b written b has a similar definition of the integral over the interval one simple way is to change every x to x similarly for the whole real line we could put together the definitions for 0 and 0 and so for each division we would use real numbers u v and u v the u v are independent if for example we took u v we would have an integral useful in complex variable theory but not one amenable to the approach of this section as one could arrange an infinity on one side of 0 that is cancelled by a negative infinity on the other side so that the integral over u need not exist the integrals of this section except for the integrals over infty with dependence of u on v have a theory like that of section 4 1 together 56 with analogues of theorem 33 the last analogues showing that the integrals are the same as those defined by the cauchy extensions but without needing double limits these results can be used as examples to test the comprehension of the reader 5 limits under the integral sign 5 1 introduction and necessary and sufficient condi tions early in the history of the calculus it was found necessary to take limits under the integral sign for example when can we integrate an infinite series term by term n 1 an x dx n 1 an x dx lim n sn x dx lim n sn x dx 84 where sn x is the sum to n terms of the series of the an x two limits are involved the limit that gives the integral and the limit as n of the sum sn x to n terms and the two limiting operations might interact and produce strange results one often quoted example involves the sequence rn of rationals see theorem 6 let sn x be the indicator of the first n rationals the function that is 0 except when x rj 1 j n when we get sn rj 1 he riemann integral of sn x over any interval is 0 but limn sn x is the indicator of all the rationals and so cannot be riemann integrable as its lower darboux sum is 0 there are irrationals in every interval and its up per darboux sum is the length of the interval there are rationals in every interval when lebesgue published his magnificent paper in 1902 that particular difficulty was resolved the lebesgue integrals of this sn x and its limit are both 0 the problem of calculus integration of derivatives was studied very care fully and after centuries of effort denjoy 1912 gave a most complicated construction to integrate all derivatives a variety of other definitions fol lowed culminating in the gauge integral the main subject of this book 57 in evaluating some integrals differentiation under the integral sign is a great help here for an integrable function s x y of x d dy s x y dx lim h s x y h s x y h dx lim h s x y h s x y h dx s x y y dx 85 again we have the inversion of two limit operations de la valle e poussin 1892 quotes a request of c jordan which is translated from the french as follows give a rigorous theory of differentiation under the integral sign of definite integrals with precise conditions which limit leibnitz s rule princi pally for unbounded regions of integration or unbounded functions and par ticularly many celebrated definite integrals clearly c jordan wished to study 85 in all its generality and after a century gauge integration enables us to find necessary and sufficient condi tions for 84 and 85 an even more complicated inversion is that of the order of repeated inte grals see tonelli 1924 for intervals i of x j of y j i s x y dx dy lim 0 d i s x y dx i lim 0 d s x y dx i j s x y dy dx 86 where here lim 0 denotes the gauge integral limit relative to y two condi tions together are both necessary and sufficient if now we interchange the two processes of integration the two conditions are interchanged as will be seen later we begin with a sequence sn x of real or complex valued functions integrable on a real interval a b that tend pointwise i e at each point to a function f x on a b as n this pointwise convergence is not a great limitation it can be relaxed to become sn x f x a e that is the finite limit occurs everywhere except in a set of variation zero or measure zero here the indicator of the set 58 where convergence does not occur is such that f x x has integral 0 for every finite valued function f see theorem 30 and in particular sn x and sn x 1 x have the same value for their integrals and sn x 1 x converges everywhere in a b two properties are examined the integrability of the limit function f over a b 87 lim n b a sn x dx b a f x dx b a lim n sn x dx 88 and the two conditions result from the two properties in the statement and proof of theorem 27 with f real or complex valued 65 and 66 follow from 64 similarly from 89 later there follow stronger results and a new kind of variation theorem 34 for each n let the real or complex valued sn x be integrable over a b and let sn x f x as n for all x in a b then a necessary and sufficient condition for 87 is that there are a closed interval c when all sn x are real valued of arbitrarily small length or a closed circle c on the complex plane of arbitrarily small radius and positive functions n x x on a b such that for all positive integer valued functions n x n x on a b and all fine divisions d of a b d sn x x v u c 89 more exactly there is a function f on a b such that d sn x x v u f b f a 90 when c has diameter 0 for d a subset of d d sn x x v u f v f u 91 the saks henstock lemma here the kolmogorov henstock lemma here is d sn x x v u f v f u k 92 where k 2 for real valued functions and k 4 for complex valued func tions 59 proof for all x in a b sn x f x as n and for an n x 0 sn x x f x for all n x n x in a b 93 if f is integrable to f on a b there is a gauge x 0 on a b such that d f x v u f 94 for all fine divisions d of a b by 93 94 we have 89 from d sn x x v u f b a n x n x 95 as the integral f x of f exists over a x a x b the integral of f over u v a b being f v f u taking f a 0 then f f b f a and 95 becomes 90 for d a subset of the set d of u v x and e the union of the finite number of u v with u v x in d d f is integrable over the disjoint intervals of e and given o we have 93 94 for replacing e replacing a b and d replacing d where d is a fine division of e and d d is a fine division of a b to replace d so d sn x x v u g b a n x n x n x n 1 x d d sn x x v u f b a n x n x d sn x x v u f v f u b a where g is the integral of f over e as d is independent of we can let 0 and obtain 91 having chosen d and n x the inequality in 91 stays the same whatever subset d we choose if all sn are real we choose for d all u v x of d with sn x v u f v f u 0 d sn x x v u f v f u d sn x x v u f v f u in d d the differences are negative and again the modulus of the sum is the sum of the moduli adding the two results we have 92 with k 2 60 when some sn are complex valued we deal separately with the real parts and with the imaginary parts and so obtain 92 with k 4 of course has been replaced by b a to obtain 92 exactly we need only begin 1 b 1 0 instead of 0 to show that 89 is sufficient i e gives 87 when each sn x is integrable over a b with sn x f x as n for all x in a b we let n x at each x so that d f x v u c 96 as c is closed for each fine division d of a b for some c with diameter 0 there is a gauge for which 96 is true so for d another fine division of a b d f x v u d f x v u 2 and theorem 23 shows the integrability of f over a b similarly 90 and 92 are sufficient the later example 13 shows that if the small diameter condition on c is omitted the weakened condition is not sufficient theorem 35 given 89 and theorem 34 a necessary and sufficient con dition for 88 is that for each 0 there are a positive integer n and a gauge n 0 n 1 2 on a b such that for all n n and all n fine divisions d of a b d sn x v u f f b a f dx 97 giving an interval or closed circle c 1 with centre f and length 2 or radius respectively proof given the integrals sn of sn x and f of f x over a b we assume sn f n for 0 let n n 0 on a b satisfy sn f 1 2 n n dn sn x v u sn 1 2 for every n fine division dn of a b these two inequalities give 97 con versely we can let n x 0 suitably to obtain 88 from 97 61 in 97 n is constant over a b so that for any subset d of d n in d d is fixed and cannot tend to as it seems that a saks henstock lemma here would need so the lemma seems unattainable here by an easy proof we now generalize theorems 34 35 to the more general limit processes already mentioned the first step is to change the integer n to y in y 0 with y theorem 36 for all x in a b and all y 0 let s x y be real or complex valued with s x y f x finite as y for all x in a b for each y 0 let s x y be integrable with respect to x in a b then a necessary and sufficient condition for the integrability of f over a b is that there are a closed interval c 2 of arbitrarily small length when all s x y are real valued or a closed circle c 2 on the complex plane of arbitrarily small radius and positive functions y and on a b such that for all functions y x y x on a b and all fine divisions d of a b d s x y x v u c 2 98 more exactly there is a function f on a b such that d s x y x v u f b f a y x y x 99 when c 2 has diameter 2 0 for d a subset of d d s x y x v u f v f u 100 d s x y x v u f v f u k 101 where k 2 for real valued functions and k 4 otherwise the last two results are the saks henstock and kolmogorov henstock lem mas here the proof of the theorem follows the proof of theorem 34 theorem 37 given s x y integrable in x on a b for each y 0 and s x y f x finite as y and 98 a necessary and sufficient condition for the integral of s x y to tend to the integral of f both integrals over a b is that for some closed interval c 3 of arbitrarily small length or some closed circle c 3 on the complex plane of arbitrarily small radius with c 3 c 2 not empty a real number y 0 a gauge x y in x on a b for each y y and all x y fine divisions d of a b d s x y v u c 3 y y 102 62 for proof see the proof of theorem 35 no saks henstock not kolmogorov henstock lemmas seem possible here we now specialize the last two theorems to continuity and differentiabil ity under the integral sign and we also consider the inversion of order of integration in double integrals note that fubini s theorem needs integration in two dimensions at least for the continuity of the integral of s x y as y tends to some number w in an interval t r of y let s x y be integrable in x over a b for each fixed y in t r then in particular s x w is integrable in x and we can ignore theorem 36 change f x to s x w and apply theorem 37 to obtain the necessary and sufficient condition for lim y w b a s x y dx b a lim y w s x y dx if we are given that s x w is integrable a priori over a b we need only also invoke theorem 36 we differentiate b a s x y dx by y on replacing s x y f x by r s x y h s x y h s x y h h 6 0 s x y y respectively we suppose that lim h 0 r s x y h s x y y 103 exists finite in a x b for every y in t r theorem 38 let the real or complex valued s x y be integrable with re spect to x in a b for each y in t r if 103 exists for each y in t r one sided at t and r then a necessary and sufficient condition for the inte grability with respect to x of s x y y over a b is that for some closed interval c 4 of arbitrarily small length when s is real valued or some closed circle c 4 on the complex plane of arbitrarily small radius two positive func tions n all real h x in 0 h x n x and all fine divisions d in a b d r s x y h x v u c 4 104 more exactly there is a function f on a b such that d r s x y h x v u f b f a 0 h x n x 105 63 when c 4 has diameter 0 for d a subset of d d r s x y h x v u f v f u 106 d r s x y h x v u f v f u k 107 where k 2 for real valued s and k 4 otherwise for proof we change s x y to r s x y h in theorem 36 theorem 39 given theorem 38 and 105 for each 0 the necessary and sufficient condition that d dy b a s x y dy b a s y dx 108 is that for some closed interval c 5 of arbitrarily small length when s is real valued or some closed circle c 5 on the complex plane of arbitrarily small radius with c 4 c 5 not empty a number n 0 a positive function h on a b for each h in 0 h n and all h fine divisions d of a b d r s x y h v u 109 1 h d s x y h s x y v u c 5 0 h n as h is the same for each fraction for proof change s x y to r s x y h in theorem 37 in a final limit under the integral sign tonelli s theorem in lebesgue integration extends to gauge integration with necessary and sufficient con ditions theorem 40 the real or complex valued s x y is integrable over an inter val i with respect to x for each fixed y and over an interval j with respect to y for each fixed x then i j s x y dy dx k 110 exists if and only if there are a closed interval c 6 of arbitrarily small length for s real valued or a closed circle c 6 on the complex plane of arbitrarily 64 small radius some positive function x on i y x on j for each x in i and all fine divisions d of i all y x fine divisions d x of j with u v x in d y in d x and d v u d x s x y c 6 111 for c 6 of diameter 0 and d a subset of d the saks henstock lemma here is d v u d x s x y v u j s x t dt dx 112 while the weierstrass henstock lemma here is d v u d x s x y v u j s x t dt dx l 113 with l 2 for real valued s and otherwise l 4 proof this is a more complicated limit theorem than theorem 34 and it deserves a more detailed proof when 110 exists given 0 there is a gauge on i with d v u j s x y dy k 114 then for mi the length of i suitable y x 0 y x fine d x over j and 114 v u 0 d v u mi 0 d x s x y j s x y dy d v u d x s x y k mi and 111 is true with an interval or circle centre k and diameter 2 2 mi to prove 111 sufficient we note that s x y is integrable with respect to y over j and that c 6 is closed let y x 0 in order to give d v u j s x y dy c 6 65 with c 6 of arbitrarily small diameter using theorem 23 j s x y dy is integrable with respect to x over i and 110 exists further 112 and 113 follow as in theorem 34 theorem 41 given 111 and the conditions in theorem 40 a necessary and sufficient condition that 86 holds is that for each 0 there is a gauge on j such that for all fine divisions e of j a gauge x y on i and depending on and y all x y fine divisions d y of i and a closed interval c 7 of length less than if s is real valued or a closed circle c 7 of diameter less than such that c 6 c 7 is not empty and for y in e u v x in d y we have e d y s x y v u c 7 115 for e a subset of e we have saks henstock and kolmogorov henstock ex tensions respectively e d y s x y v u i s x y dx dy 116 e d y s x y v u i s x y dx dy l 117 with l 2 for real valued s and otherwise l 4 proof to show the necessity of 115 let 86 exist then given 0 a gauge on j is such that for all fine divisions e of j e i s x y dy k e i s x y dy i e s x y dx further for each y in j and all x in i there is a gauge x y such that for x y fine divisions d y of i d y s x y v u i s x y dy e d y s x y v u k mj 66 giving 115 with c 7 k mj k mj having k in common with c 6 to show that 115 is sufficient for 86 given the results of theorem 40 we have k in c 6 and c 6 c 7 not empty as c 6 is arbitrarily small in diameter and c 7 is closed k is also in c 7 in 115 we use gauge integration with x y 0 for each fixed y and e i s x y dx c 7 again theorem 23 gives integrability this time of j i s x y dx dy c 7 k c 7 which give 86 results 111 and 115 are very similar with x and i interchanged with y and j so that saks henstock and kolmogorov henstock lemmas hold here in both theorems further the limit function has been j s x y dy taken under the integral sign i dx for which we have the two conditions 111 115 we could have taken the limit function to be i s x y dx under the inte gral sign j dy in which case the two necessary and sufficient conditions are 115 and 111 in that order which gives a check of the theory when s x y is gauge integrable in i j 113 and 117 can be improved to d d x s x y v u v u s x y dy dx l 118 see theorem this seems unprovable using only the two one dimensional integrations bartle 1994 95 assumes the integrability of sn and f in theorems 34 35 with another necessary and sufficient condition theorem 42 for a sequence sn of real valued functions on a closed inter val i of the real line with sn and f integrable over i but not with sn f as n the necessary and sufficient conditions for 88 is that given 0 there is an integer n such that if n n a gauge n on i has the property that for every n fine division d of i d sn x v u d f x v u 119 67 condition 119 is like 97 the integral f of f being replaced by the ap proximating riemann sum for proof follow the proof of theorem 35 the part of the theory involving closed bounded sets c is taken from henstock 1988 pp 105 108 127 128 135 136 and 170 172 the various saks henstock and kolmogorov henstock lemmas in this section are new and involve a new kind of variation which we could call limit variation of functions hy i x of the interval point pairs i x together with a parameter y that in some sense tends to a limit when y is nearer than y to the limit in this sense we write y y thus lv hy i x y a b sup y y d d hy i x where d is a fine division of a b and the limit variation is lv hy i x y a b inf y lv hy i x y a b lim sup d hy i x in every example of limits up to this point the limit variation is 0 in 92 101 107 113 117 respectively with i u v hy i x sy x v u f v f u y n x hy i x sy x v u f v f u y hy i x r s x y k v u f v f u k x 0 hy i x v u d x s x t v u j s x t dt dx where y and y are gauges and on j and d x is fine with i u v h i y d y s t y v u i s t y dt dy i where and x are gauges 1 and on i 1 and d y is 1 fine over j as for the variation we can consider the limit variation for sets x on the real line by using their indicator x x giving lv hy i x y a b x lv hy i x y a b x on substituting hy x x for hy in the previous definitions we can now have definitions and theorems analogous to theorems 28 29 30 31 for the variations 68 example 13 let sn x 1 0 x 1 1 pp p 1 2 1 p x 2 1 p 1 p 1 2 n 0 2 1 n 1 x 2 show that sn x is integrable over 0 2 and give the integral if sn x f x as n so that f x 1 0 x 1 1 pp p 1 2 1 p x 2 1 p 1 p 1 2 0 x 2 if n 2 1 and n x 1 p in the respective ranges and if n n then sn x x f x show that sums over divisions of f x lie between 0 and 1 so that 39 is satisfied for a c that includes 0 1 but 2 1 n 0 f x dx 1 n p 1 1 p and does not tend to a limit as n thus the cauchy limit property fails f is not integrable in 0 2 and 39 cannot be satisfied by a c with arbitrarily small diameter 5 2 special limit theorems for sequences of functions following lebesgue 1902 w h young 1910 gave a list of known results on limits of sequences of functions under the integral sign and so for 80 years these results including monotone and majorized dominated convergence have been the mainstay of lebesgue theory in this section we prove such sufficient conditions with others beginning with monotone convergence over an interval a b a b with b a finite we use repeatedly the fact that a monotone increasing sequence of real numbers either tends to a limit or tends to infinity 69 theorem 43 for each positive integer n let sn x be gauge integrable over a b and for each such n let sn x sn 1 x g x a x b where g is some finite real valued function so that f x lim n sn x exists finite on a b if sn is the integral of sn x over a b and if sn is a bounded sequence with supremum f then f is gauge integrable over a b to the value f proof the integral sn i of sn x exists over every interval i a b theorem 24 as sn sn a b is given to be a bounded sequence with supremum f and monotone increas ing by theorem 21 so that sn converges to f then given 0 there is an integer n with f sn sn f n n 120 also by theorem 26 there is a gauge n such that for all n fine divisions d of a b d sn x v u sn u v 2 n n 1 2 121 let t x n be the least integer for which f x st x x f x x t x x 0 122 and letd be a fine division of a b so formed of a finite number of interval point pairs i x let p q be the least and greatest values of t x for i x in d then q p n as the integral is finitely additive and monotone increasing in n theorems 24 and 21 and with 120 f sp d sp i d st x i d sq i sq f 70 grouping together the i x in d with equal t x and using 121 122 and monotonicity f 2 d st x x v u f f 2 d f x v u d st x x v u b a f b a as 0 the first and last values tend to f so f integrates to f on the domain a b this is usually called the weak monotone convergence theorem for the strong monotone convergence theorem we omit just the bound edness of sn x proving that there is a set x of x in which sn x is unbounded but for which s n x sn x x x is integrable to the same value as sn x where x is the complement of x and x x is its indicator taking the value 1 on x and the value 0 on x theorem 44 in the conditions of theorem 43 omitting that sn x is bounded in n and for x the set where sn x is unbounded in n lim n s n x is finite and integrable in a b lim n b a sn x dx lim n b a s n x dx proof by the monotonicity sn x s 1 x 0 replacing sn x s 1 x by sn x in the proof we assume that sn x 0 let n be a fixed positive integer with u x the smallest integer with su x x n x x u x 1 x x 123 using 121 given 0 let j be a gauge on a b such that d sj x v u sj u v 2 j 124 71 for each j fine division d of a b and put x u x x 0 a fine division d of a b has only a finite number of i x and so only a finite number of u x which have a maximum say w by 123 124 and monotonicity d n v u x x d su x x v u d su x u v d sw u v sw a b f v m i a b x v m i x f n v m i a b x 0 being true for all positive integers n by theorem 28 72 b a sn x dx b a sn x x x dx and the sequence sn x x x is bounded in n for each x in a b so that theorem 43 gives the result now we can deal with absolutely convergent series in integration theorem 45 let sn x and sn x be integrable in a b a b if n 1 b a sn x dx 125 is convergent then f x n 1 sn x 126 is absolutely convergent almost everywhere and is integrable over a b with b a f x dx n 1 b a sn x dx 127 72 proof bt theorem 44 and 125 126 is absolutely convergent a e since b a n n 1 sn x dx n n 1 b a sn x dx n 1 b a sn x dx g x n 1 sn x is integrable over a b and we have 127 with sn x replaced by sn x if the sn x are real valued the theorem is true for the sn x sn x 0 subtracting the results for sn x gives 127 for real valued sn x complex valued sn x are split into the real and imaginary parts using theorem 22 127 is true for the real parts and for the imaginary parts and so for complex valued sn x finishing the proof we now come to a test that uses bounded riemann sums from which we obtain the arzela lebesgue majorized dominated convergence test we begin with the integrability of the minimum function of a finite col lection of functions clearly here we need the sn x to be real valued and in part of the proof the expert will recognise a refinement integral theorem 46 let the real valued sn x be integrable to sn over a b for n n n 1 p p n for a gauge on a b and a number m let every fine division d of a b and every function n i x of interval point pairs i x integer valued in the range n n p give d sn i x x v u m and min n n i x p sn i x x 128 is then integrable over a b proof given the real numbers sn sn 1 sp and tn tn 1 tp we have min n n p sn sj sj tj tj sj tj tj sn tn sn 1 tn 1 sp tp tj for n j p on the right we choose tj to be the least of the tn tp followed by inter changing sj tj min n n p sn min n m p tm sn tn sp tp 129 73 in the theorem with sn x integrable to sn over a b n n p there is by theorem 27 66 for 0 a gauge n on a b such that for every n fine division dn of a b dn sn x v u sn u v p n 1 sn u v v u sn x dx 130 hence for x the least of the finite number of gauges n x p x then x 0 in a b and for d a fine division of a b we have 130 for d replacing dn by 129 d min n n p sn x v u min n m p sm u v p n n sn v u sn u v 131 we now have to show that as 0 d min n n p sn u v tends to a limit the expert will recognise that we are proving the existence of the refinement integral of the minimum min n n p sn min n m p tm sj tj n j p proves on taking the minimum of the right hand side that min n n p sn min n m p tm min n n p sn tn 132 if a u b put sn a u for sn sn u b for tn to show that if a b splits into two intervals at u the sum of the minima does not rise repeating for more points of division we see that on subdividing i e refining a division the sum of minima of the sn u v falls or stays the same by 128 the infimum t of the sums of minima over divisions of a b exists and t m given 0 let d be a division of a b for which the sum of minima lies in t t by theorem 26 there is a gauge such that every fine division d of a b refines d with the for 131 and the gauge min 74 every fine division d of a b refines d and so its sum of minima lies in t t by 131 t d min n n p sn x v u t 2 as 0 is arbitrarily small min n n p sn x is integrable to t over a b we can now turn to majorized or dominated convergence beginning with a theorem that in lebesgue theory leads to fatou s lemma theorem 47 for a b and the real valued sn x integrable over a b to sn a b m with 128 m 1 2 true if lim infn sn a b is not lim infn sn x exists almost everywhere in a b is integrable over a b and b a lim inf n sn x dx lim inf n b a sn x dx lim inf n sn a b 133 proof by theorem 46 the minimum of sn x for n n p is integrable and it is monotone decreasing in p to the infimum which is monotone in creasing in n by 128 theorem 44 strong monotone convergence and lim infn sn a b finite the infimum exists everywhere and is integrable and the lim inf exists almost everywhere and is integrable since b a lim inf n sn x dx lim n b a inf n n sn x dx lim n lim p b a min n n p sn x dx lim n lim p min n n p b a sn x dx given finite thus we also prove 133 multiplying by 1 gives us another theorem 75 theorem 48 for a b let the real valued sn x be integrable over a b to sn a b let there be a gauge on a b and a number q such that for every fine division d of a b and every integer valued function n i x 1 d sn i x x v u q 134 then max n n p sn x p n is integrable over a b if also lim sup n n p sn x p n is integrable over a b if also lim supn sn a b is finite then lim sup n sn x exists almost everywhere in a b and is integrable over a b and b a lim sup n sn x dx lim sup n b a sn x dx lim sup n sn a b 135 combining theorems 47 48 we have the majorized convergence theorem theorem 49 for a b let the real valued sn x be integrable over a b to sn a b let there be a gauge on a b and numbers p q such that for every fine division d of a b and every integer valued function n i x 1 p d sn i x x v u q 136 if limn sn x exists finite almost everywhere then both sides exist finite below and b a lim n sn x dx lim n b a sn x dx 137 proof in 136 take n i x n constant then p sn a b q and both of lim sup n sn a b lim inf n sn a b 76 are finite by 133 135 we have 137 from b a lim n sn x dx lim inf n b a sn x dx lim sup n b a sn x dx b a lim n sn x dx giving the result the more usual statement of the majorized dominated convergence the orem involves two functions g x h x integrable over a b such that g x sn x h x for all or almost all x then for a suitable gauge and fine divisions of a b 136 is true conversely g x inf n 1 sn x h x sup n 1 sn x are suitable given 136 and by theorem 46 for the integrability
