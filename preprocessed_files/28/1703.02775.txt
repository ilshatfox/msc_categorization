cubical covers of sets in rn laramie paxton 1 and kevin r vixie 1 1 department of mathematics and statistics washington state university abstract wild sets in rn can be tamed through the use of various repre sentations though sometimes this taming removes features considered important finding the wildest sets for which it is still true that the representations faithfully inform us about the

brief reminder 25 1 introduction in this paper we explain and illuminate a few ideas for 1 representing sets and 2 learning from those representations though some of the ideas and results we explain are likely written down elsewhere though we are not aware of those references our purpose is not to claim priority to those pieces but rather to stimulate thought and exploration our primary intended audience is students of mathematics even though other more mature mathematicians may find a few of the ideas interesting we believe that cubical covers can be used at an earlier point in the student career and that both the numbers idea introduced by peter jones and the idea of varifolds pioneered by almgren and allard and now actively being developed by menne buet and collaborators are still very much underutilized by all young and old to that end we have written this exploration hoping that the questions and ideas presented here some rather elementary will stimulate others to explore the ideas for themselves we begin by briefly introducing cubical covers jones and varifolds after which we look more closely at questions involving cubical covers then both of the other approaches are explained in a little bit of detail mostly as an invitation to more exploration after which we close with problems for the reader and some unexplored questions acknowledgments lp thanks robert hardt and frank morgan for useful comments and krv thanks bill allard for useful conversations and peter jones gilad lerman and raanan schul for introducing him to the idea of the jones representations 2 2 representing sets their boundaries in rn 2 1 cubical refinements dyadic cubes in order to characterize various sets in rn we explore the use of cubical covers whose cubes have side lengths which are positive integer powers of 1 2 dyadic cubes or more precisely closed dyadic n cubes with sides parallel to the axes thus the side length at the dth subdivision is l c 1 2 d which can be made as small as desired figure 1 illustrates this by looking at a unit cube in r 2 lying in the first quadrant with a vertex at the origin we then form a sequence of refinements by dividing each side length in half successively and thus quadrupling the number of cubes each time definition 2 1 we shall say that the n cube c with side length denoted as l c is dyadic if c n j 1 mj 2 d mj 1 2 d mj z d n 0 l c 1 21 d 0 d 1 d 2 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 l c 1 20 l c 1 22 figure 1 dyadic cubes in this paper we will assume c to be a dyadic n cube throughout we will denote the union of the dyadic n cubes with edge length 1 2 d that intersect a set e rn by ced and define c e d to be the boundary of this union see figure 2 two simple questions we will explore for their illustrative purposes are 1 if we know ln ced what can we say about l n e and similarly 2 if we know hn 1 ced what can we say about h n 1 e 3 e ced figure 2 cubical cover ced of a set e 2 2 jones numbers another approach to representing sets in rn developed by jones 27 and gener alized by okikiolu 45 lerman 30 and schul 47 involves the question of under what conditions a bounded set e can be contained within a rectifiable curve which jones likened to the traveling salesman problem taken over an infinite set see definition 3 2 below for the definition of rectifiable jones showed that if the aspect ratios of the optimal containing cylinders in each dyadic cube go to zero fast enough the set e is contained in a rectifiable curve jones approach ends up providing one useful approach of defining a representation for a set in rn similar to those discussed in the next section we return to this topic in section 5 1 the basic idea is illustrated in figure 3 4 c figure 3 jones numbers the green lines indicate the thinnest cylinder containing in the cube c we see from this relatively large width that is not very flat in this cube 2 3 working upstairs varifolds a third way of representing sets in rn uses varifolds instead of representing e rn by working in rn we work in the grassmann bundle rn g n m we parameterize the grassmannian g 2 1 by taking the upper unit semicircle in r 2 including the point 1 0 but not including 1 where both points are given in polar coordinates and straightening it out into a vertical axis as in figure 4 the bundle r 2 g 2 1 is then represented by r 2 0 5 0 0 figure 4 the vertical axis for the upstairs 0 0 r 2 2 e r 2 s 2 s 1 s 2 e 1 e 2 figure 5 working upstairs in the grassmann bundle figure 5 illustrates how the tangents are built into this representation of subsets of rn giving us a sense of why this representation might be useful a circular curve in r 2 becomes two half spirals upstairs in the grassmann bundle representation as shown in the first image of figure 5 other curves in r 2 are similarly illuminated by their grassmann bundle representations we return to this idea in section 5 2 3 simple questions let e rn and c be any dyadic n cube as before define c e d c c e 6 l c 1 2 d and as above ced c c e d c 6 here are two questions 1 given e rn when is there a d 0 such that for all d d 0 we have ln ced m n l n e 1 for some constant m n independent of e 2 given e rn and any 0 when does there exists a d 0 such that for all d d 0 we have ln ced 1 l n e 2 remark 3 1 of course using the fact that lebesgue measure is a radon measure we can very quickly get that for d large enough i e 2 d small enough the measure of the cubical cover is as close to the measure of the set as you want as long as the set is compact and has positive measure but the focus of this paper is on what we can get in a much more transparent barehanded fashion so we explore along different paths getting answers that are by some metrics suboptimal example 3 1 if e qn 0 1 n then ln e 0 but ln ced 1 d 0 example 3 2 let e be as in example 3 1 enumerate e as q 1 q 2 q 3 now let di b q i 2 i and e di 0 1 n with chosen small enough so that ln e 1100 then l n e 1100 but l n ce d 1 d 0 3 1 a union of balls for a given set f rn suppose e x f b x r a union of closed balls of radius r centered at each point x in f then we know that e is regular locally ahlfors n regular or locally n regular and thus there exist 0 m m and an r 0 0 such that for all x e and for all 0 r r 0 we have mrn ln b x r e mrn this is all we need to establish a sufficient condition for equation 1 above remark 3 2 the upper bound constant m is immediate since e is a union of n balls so m n the n volume of the unit n ball works however this is not the case for k regular sets in rn k n since we are now asking for a bound on the k dimensional measure of an n dimensional set which could easily be infinite 1 suppose e x f b x r a union of closed balls of radius r centered at each point x in f 7 2 let c c e d for some d such that 1 2 d r and let c 3 c c c where 3 c is an n cube concentric with c with sides parallel to the axes and l 3 c 3 l c as shown in figure 6 r c 3 c figure 6 concentric cubes 3 this implies that for 3 c c ln 3 c e ln 3 c 0 with r 3 4 we then make the following observations a note that there are 3 n different tilings of the plane by 3 c cubes whose vertices live on the 1 2 d lattice this can be seen by realizing that there are 3 n shifts you can perform on a 3 c cube and both 1 keep the originally central cube c in the 3 c cube and 2 keep the vertices of the 3 c cube in the 1 2 d lattice b denote the 3 c cubes in these tilings ti i 1 3 n c define c i c ti d note now that by step 3 the number of 3 c cubes in c i cannot exceed ni ln e ln 3 c e denote the total number of cubes in c by nce d f the number of cubes in c nce d cannot exceed 3 n i 1 ni 3 n l n e ln 3 c 8 g putting it all together we get ln ced l n c cc nce d ln c 3 n ln e ln 3 c ln c ln e 4 5 this shows that if e x f b x r then ln ced 1 ln e we now have two conclusions regularized sets we notice that for any fixed r 0 0 as long as we pick d 0 big enough then r r 0 and d d 0 imply that e x f b x r satisfies ln ced 1 n ln e for a n 0 that depends on n but not on f regular sets now suppose that f rm w rn mrn ln w b x r x w and r r 0 then we immediately get the same result for a big enough d depending only on r 0 ln cfd 1 m ln f where m 0 depends only on the regularity class that f lives in and not on which subset in that class we cover with the cubes 3 2 minkowski content definition 3 1 minkowski content let w rn and let wr x d x w r the n 1 dimensional minkowski content is defined asmn 1 w limr 0 ln wr 2 r when the limit exists see figure 7 definition 3 2 hm m rectifiable set a set w rn is called hm m rectifiable if hm w and hm almost all of w is contained in the union of the images of countably many lipschitz functions from rm to rn we will use rectifiable and hm m rectifiable interchangeably when the dimension of the sets are clear from the context 9 2 r wr w figure 7 minkowski content definition 3 3 m rectifiable we will say that e rn is m rectifiable if there is a lipschitz function mapping a bounded subset of rm onto e theorem 3 1 mn 1 w hn 1 w when w is a closed n 1 rectifiable set see theorem 3 2 39 in 23 for a proof remark 3 3 notice that m rectifiable is more restrictive that hm m rectifiable in fact theorem 3 1 is false for hm m rectifiable sets see the notes at the end of section 3 2 39 in 23 for details now let w be n 1 rectifiable set rd n 1 2 d and choose r small enough so that ln wrd m n 1 w 2 rd for all d n 0 such that rd r note because the diameter of an n cube with edge length 1 2 d is rd n 1 2 d no point of cwd can be farther than rd away from w thus cwd wrd assume that ln e 6 0 and e is n 1 rectifiable letting w e we have ln ced l n e ln wrd mn 1 e 2 rd mn 1 e 2 r so that ln ced 1 l n e where mn 1 e 2 r ln e 5 since we control r and we can make as small as we like and we have a sufficient condition to establish equation 2 above 10 the result let be as in equation 5 and e rn such that ln e 6 0 suppose that e which is automatically closed is n 1 rectifiable and hn 1 e then for every 0 there exists a d 0 such that for all d d 0 ln ced 1 l n e problem 3 1 suppose that e rn is bounded show that for any r 0 er the set of points that are at most a distance r from e has a hn 1 n 1 rectifiable boundary show this by showing that er is contained in a finite number of graphs of lipschitz functions from rn 1 to r hint cut er into small chunks fi with common diameter d r and prove that fi r is the union of a finite number of lipschitz graphs problem 3 2 can you show that in fact the boundary of er er is actually n 1 rectifiable see if you can use the results of the previous problem to help you remark 3 4 we can cover a union e of open balls of radius r whose centers are bounded with a cover ced satisfying equation 2 in this case c e d certainly meets the requirements for the result just shown 3 3 smooth boundary positive reach in this section we show that if e is smooth at least c 1 1 then e has positive reach allowing us to get an even cleaner bound depending in a precise way on the curvature of e we will assume that e is closed define er x rn dist x e r cls x y e d x e x y and unique e x cls x is a single point definition 3 4 reach the reach of e reach e is defined reach e sup r er unique e remark 3 5 sets of positive reach were introduced by federer in 1959 22 in a paper that also introduced the famous coarea formula remark 3 6 if e rn is n 1 dimensional and e is closed then e e another equivalent definition involves rolling balls around the boundary of e the closed ball b x r touches e if b x r e b x r e definition 3 5 the reach of e reach e is defined reach e sup r every ball of radius r touching e touches at a single point 11 put a little more informally reach e is the supremum of radii r of the balls such that each ball of that radius rolling around e touches e at only one point see figure 8 positive reach non positive reach figure 8 positive and non positive reach as mentioned above if e is c 1 1 then it has positive reach see remark 4 20 in 22 that is if for all x e there is a neighborhood of x ux rn such that after a suitable change of coordinates there is a c 1 1 function f rn 1 r such that e ux is the graph of f recall that a function is c 1 1 if its derivative is lipschitz continuous this implies among other things that the symmetric second fundamental form of e exists hn 1 almost everywhere on e the fact that e is c 1 1 implies that at hn 1 almost every point of e the n 1 principal curvatures i of our set exist and i 1 reach e for 1 i n 1 we will use this fact to determine a bound for the n 1 dimensional change in area as the boundary of our set is expanded outwards or contracted inwards by see figure 9 diagram 1 let us first look at this in r 2 by examining the following ratios of lengths of expanded or contracted arcs for sectors of a ball in r 2 as shown in diagram 2 in figure 9 below 12 diagram 1 diagram 2 l l l figure 9 moving out and sweeping in h 1 l h 1 l r r 1 r 1 h 1 l h 1 l r r 1 r 1 where is the principal curvature of the circle the boundary of the 2 ball which we can think of as defining the reach of a set e r 2 with c 1 1 smooth boundary the jacobian for the normal map pushing in or out by which by the area formula is the factor by which the area changes is given by n 1 i 1 1 i see figure 9 diagram 1 if we define max 1 2 n 1 then we have the following ratios max fractional increase of hn 1 boundary area moving out n 1 i 1 1 i 1 n 1 max fractional decrease of hn 1 boundary area sweeping in n 1 i 1 1 i 1 n 1 remark 3 7 notice that 1 reach e for a ball we readily find the value of the ratio 13 ln b 0 r ln b 0 r r r n 1 n setting 1 n 6 where 1 r is the curvature of the ball along any geodesic now we calculate the bound we are interested in for e assuming e is c 1 1 define e rn x d x e we first compute a bound for ln e ln e ln e ln e e ln e 1 ln e e ln e 7 since i is a function of x e defined hn 1 almost everywhere we may set up the integral below over e and do the actual computation over e k where k the set of measure 0 where i is not defined computing bounds for the numerator and denominator separately in the second term in 7 we find by way of the area formula 43 ln e e 0 e n 1 i 1 1 r i dhn 1 dr 0 e 1 r n 1 dhn 1 dr hn 1 e 1 r n n 0 hn 1 e 1 n n 1 n 8 and ln e r 0 0 e n 1 i 1 1 r i dhn 1 dr r 0 0 e 1 r n 1 dhn 1 dr hn 1 e 1 r n n r 0 0 hn 1 e n when r 0 1 9 14 from 7 8 and 9 we have ln e ln e 1 hn 1 e 1 n n 1 n hn 1 e n 1 n setting 1 n 10 from this we get that ln e 1 nln e so that ln ced 1 nln e where d log 2 n is found by solving n 1 2 d thus when e is smooth enough to have positive reach we find a nice bound of the type in equation 2 with a precisely known dependence on curvature 4 a boundary conjecture what can we say about boundaries can we bound hn 1 ced hn 1 e e ced e figure 10 cubes on the boundary conjecture 4 1 if e rn is compact and e is c 1 1 lim sup d hn 1 ced hn 1 e n brief sketch of proof for n 2 1 since e is c 1 1 we can zoom in far enough at any point x e so that it looks flat 15 2 let c be a cube in the cover c e d that intersects the boundary near x and has faces in the boundary ced define f c c e d 3 case 1 assume that the tangent at x tx e is not parallel to either edge direction of the cubical cover see figure 11 a let be the projection onto the horizontal axis and notice that h 1 f f 2 for any epsilon b this is stable to perturbations which is important since the actual piece of the boundary e we are dealing with is not a straight line 4 case 2 suppose that the tangent at x tx e is parallel to one of the two faces of the cubical cover and let ux be a neighborhood of x e a zooming in far enough we see that the cubical boundary can only oscil late up and down so that the maximum ratio for any horizontal tangent is locally 2 b but we can create a sequence of examples that attain ratios as close to 2 as we like by finding a careful sequence of perturbations that attains a ratio locally of 2 for any see figure 10 c that is we can create perturbations that on an unbounded set of d s di i 1 yield a ratio h 1 ce di ux e 2 and we can send 0 5 use the compactness of e to put this all together into a complete proof 16 ced e figure 11 the case in which the angle between tx e and the x axis is neither 0 nor 2 problem 4 1 suppose we exclude c s that contain less than some fraction of e as defined in conjecture 4 1 from the cover to get the reduced cover c ed in this case what is the optimal bound b for the ratio of boundary measures lim sup d hn 1 c ed hn 1 e b 5 other representations 5 1 the jones approach as mentioned above another approach to representing sets in rn developed by jones 27 and generalized by okikiolu 45 lerman 30 and schul 47 involves the question of under what conditions a bounded set e can be contained within a rectifiable curve which jones likened to the traveling salesman problem taken over an infinite set while jones worked in c in his original paper the work of okikiolu lerman and schul extended the results to rn n n as well as infinite dimensional space recall that a compact connected set r 2 is rectifiable if it is contained in the image of a countable set of lipschitz maps from r into r 2 except perhaps for a set of h 1 measure zero we have the result that if is compact and connected then l h 1 implies it is rectifiable see pages 34 and 35 of 21 17 let wc denote the width of the thinnest cylinder containing the set e in the dyadic n cube c see figure 12 and define the number of e in c to be e c wc l c e c wc figure 12 jones numbers and wc each of the two green lines in a cube c is an equal distance away from the red line and is chosen so that the green lines define the thinnest cylinder containing e c then the red lines are varied over all possible lines in c to find that red line whose corresponding cylinder is the thinnest of all containing cylinders in this sense the minimizing red lines are the best fit to e in each c jones main result is this theorem theorem 5 1 27 let e be a bounded set and be a connected set both in r 2 define c wcl c where wc is the width of the thinnest cylinder in the 2 cube c containing then summing over all possible c 2 c 3 c 2 l c l where r conversely if 2 e there is a connected set with e such that l 1 diam e 2 e where 0 and r 18 jones main result generalized to rn is that a bounded set e rn is contained in a rectifiable curve if and only if 2 e c e 3 c 2 l c where the sum is taken over all dyadic cubes note that each number of e is calculated over the dyadic cube 3 c as defined in section 3 1 intuitively we see that in order for e to lie within a rectifiable curve e must look flat as we zoom in on points of e since has tangents at h 1 almost every point x since both wc and l c are in units of length e c is a scale invariant measure of the flatness of e in c in higher dimensions the analogous cylinders widths and cube edge lengths are also divided to get a scale invariant e c the notion of local linear approximation has been explored by many researchers see for example the work of lerman and collaborators 16 6 53 7 while distances other than the sup norm have been considered when determining closeness to the approximating line see 30 there is room for more exploration there in the section below problems and questions we suggest an idea involving the multiscale flat norm from geometric measure theory 5 2 a varifold approach as mentioned above a third way of representing sets in rn uses varifolds instead of representing e rn by working in rn we work in the grassmann bundle rn g n m advantages include for example the automatic encoding of tangent information directly into the representation by building into the representation this tangent information we make set comparisons where we care about tangent structure easy and natural definition 5 1 grassmannian the m dimensional grassmannian in rn g n m g rn m is the set of all m dimensional planes through the origin for example g 2 1 is the space of all lines through the origin in r 2 and g 3 2 is the space of all planes through the origin in r 3 the grassmann bundle rn g n m can be thought of as a space where g n m is attached to each point in rn definition 5 2 varifold a varifold is a radon measure on the grassmann bundle rn g n m 19 suppose x g rn g n m x one of the most common appearances of varifolds are those that arise from rectifiable sets e in this case the measure e on rn g n m is the pushforward of m hausdorff measure on e by the tangent map t x x txe let e rn be an hm m rectifiable set see definition 3 2 we know the approximate m dimensional tangent space txe exists hm almost everywhere since e is hm m rectifiable which in turn implies that except for an hm measure 0 set e is contained in the union of the images of countably many lipschitz functions from rm to rn the measure of a rn g n m is given by a hm t 1 a let s x txe x e the section of the grassmann bundle defining the varifold s intersected with each fiber x g n m is the single point x txe and so we could just as well use the projection in which case we would have e a hm a s definition 5 3 a rectifiable varifold is a radon measure e defined on an hm m rectifiable set e rn recalling s x txe x e let a rn g n m and define e a hm a s we will call e s the downstairs representation of s for any s rn g n m and we will call s t e rn g n m the upstairs representation of any rectifiable set e where t is the tangent map over the rectifiable set e 0 0 r 2 2 e r 2 s 2 s 1 s 2 e 1 e 2 figure 13 working upstairs figure 13 repeated from above illustrates how the tangents are built into this representation of subsets of rn giving us a sense of why this representation might be useful suppose we have three line segments almost touching each other i e 20 appearing to touch as subsets of r 2 the upstairs view puts each segment at a different height corresponding to the angle of the segment so these segments are not close in any sense in r 2 g n m or consider a straight line segment and a very fine sawtooth curve that may look practically indistinguishable but will appear drastically different upstairs we can use varifold representations in combination with a cubical cover to get a quantized version of a curve that has tangent information as well as position information if for example we cover a set s r 2 g 2 1 with cubes of edge length 1 2 d and use this cover as a representation for s we know the position and angle to within 3 2 d 1 in other words we can approximate our curve s r 2 g 2 1 by the union of the centers of the cubes with edge length 1 2 d intersecting s this simple idea seems to merit further exploration 6 problems and questions problem 6 1 find a smooth e with e rn such that hn 1 ced h n 1 e 0 d hint look at unbounded e r 2 such that l 2 ec problem 6 2 suppose that e is open and hn 1 e show that if the reach of e is positive then lim inf d hn 1 ced hn 1 e 1 hint first show that e has unique inward and outward pointing normals takes a bit of work next examine the map f e rn where f x x x n x n x is the normal to e at x and x is a positive real valued function chosen so that locally f e ced use the binet cauchy formula to find the jacobian and then apply the area formula to do this calculation notice that at any point x 0 e we can choose coordinates so that tx 0 e is horizontal i e n x 0 en calculate using f tx 0 e r n 1 rn where f x x x n x see chapter 3 of 20 for the binet cauchy formula and the area formula problem 6 3 suppose e has dimension n 1 positive reach and is locally regular in rn a find bounds for hn ced 1 2 d b how does this ratio relate to hn 1 e hint use the ideas in section 3 3 to calculate a bound on the volume of the tube with thickness 2 n 2 d centered on e 21 question 6 1 can we use the upstairs version of cubical covers to find better representations for sets and their boundaries of course better depends on your objective for the following question we need the notion of the multiscale flat norm 44 the basic idea of this distance which works in spaces of oriented curves and surfaces of any dimension known as currents is that we can decompose the curve or surface t into t s s but we measure the cost of the decomposition by adding the volumes of t s and s not s by volume we mean the m dimensional volume or m volume of an m dimensional object so if t is m dimensional we would add the m volume of t s and the m 1 volume of s scaled by the parameter we get that f t min s mm t s mm 1 s it turns out that t s is the best approximation to t that has curvature bounded by 2 we exploit this in the following ideas and questions remark 6 1 currents can be thought of as generalized oriented curves or surfaces of any dimension k more precisely they are members of the dual space to the space of k forms for the purposes of this section thinking of them as perhaps unions of pieces of oriented k dimensional surfaces w so that w and w are simply oppositely oriented and cancel if we add them will be enough to understand what is going on for a nice introduction to the ideas see for example the first few chapters of 43 question 6 2 choose k 1 2 3 in what follows we focus on sets which are one dimensional the interior of a cube c will be denoted co and we will work at some scale d i e the edge length of the cube will be 1 2 d consider the piece of in co co inside the cube c with edge length 1 2 d we will use the flat norm to 1 find an approximation of co with curvature bounded by 2 d k and 2 find the distance of that approximation from co this decomposition is then obtained by minimizing m 1 co s 2 d km 2 s h 1 co s 2 d kl 2 s the minimal s will be denoted sd see figure 14 22 sd co co sd co figure 14 multiscale flat norm decomposition inspiring the definition of f suppose that we define f c by f c l c 2 d kl 2 sd so that f c 2 2 d kl 2 sd what can we say about the properties e g rectifiability of given the finiteness of c f 3 c 2 l c question 6 3 can we get an advantage by using the flat norm decomposition as a preconditioner before we find cubical cover approximations for example define f d c d d and d sd where sd argmin s h 1 s 2 d kl 2 s since the flat norm minimizers have bounded mean curvature is this enough to force the cubical covers to give us better quantitative information on how about in the case in which e e r 2 7 further exploration there are a number of places to begin in exploring these ideas further some of these works require significant dedication to master and it is always recommended that you have someone who has mastered a path into pieces of these areas that you can ask questions of when you first wade in nonetheless if you remember that the language can always be translated into pictures and you make the effort to do that headway towards mastery can always be made here is an annotated list with comments 23 primary varifold references almgren s little book 4 and allard s founding contribution 1 are the primary sources for varifolds leon simon s book on geometric measure theory 48 available for free online has a couple of excellent chapters one of which is an exposition of allard s paper recent varifold work both buet and collaborators 9 10 8 11 12 and charon and collaborators 13 14 15 have been digging into varifolds with an eye to applications while these papers are a good start there is still a great deal of opportunity for the use and further development of varifolds on the theoretical front there is the work of menne and collaborators 34 35 36 37 38 28 39 40 41 42 we want to call special attention to the recent introduction to the idea of a varifold that appeared in the december 2017 ams notices 41 geometric measure theory i the area underlying the ideas here are those from geometric measure theory the fundamental treatise in the subject is still federer s 1969 geometric measure theory 23 even though most people start by reading morgan s beautiful introduction to the subject geometric mea sure theory a beginner s guide 43 and evans measure theory and fine properties of functions 20 also recommended are leon simon s lecture notes 48 francesco maggi s book that updates the classic italian approach 32 and krantz and parks geometric integration theory 29 geometric measure theory ii the book by mattila 33 approaches the sub ject from the harmonic analysis flavored thread of geometric measure theory some use this as a first course in geometric measure theory albeit one that does not touch on minimal surfaces which is the focus of the other texts above de lellis exposition rectifiable sets densities and tangent measures 18 or priess 1987 paper geometry of measures in rn distribution rectifiability and densities 46 is also very highly recommended jones in addition to the papers cited in the text 27 45 30 47 there are related works by david and semmes that we recommended see for example 17 there is also the applied work by gilad lerman and his collaborators that is often inspired by jones and his own development of jones ideas in 30 see also 16 53 52 6 see also the work by maggioni and collaborators 31 3 multiscale flat norm the flat norm was introduced by whitney in 1957 51 and used to create a topology on currents that permitted federer and fleming in their landmark paper in 1960 24 to obtain the existence of minimizers in 2007 morgan and vixie realized that a variational functional introduced in image analysis was actually computing a multiscale generalization of the flat norm 44 the ideas are beginning to be explored in these papers 50 19 26 49 25 5 24 a measures a brief reminder in this section we remind the reader of a handful of concepts used in the text measure one way to think of a measure is as a generalization of the familiar notions of length area and volume in a way that allows us to define how we assign size to a given subset of a set x the most common being that of n dimensional lebesgue measure ln formally let x be a nonempty set and 2 x be the collection of all subsets of x a measure is defined 20 to be a mapping 2 x 0 such that 1 0 and 2 if a i 1 ai then a i 1 ai note that in most texts this definition is known as an outer measure but we use this definition with the advantage that we can still measure non measurable sets measurable a subset s x is called measurable if and only if it satisfies the carathe odory condition for each set a x a a s a s radon measure let us define the borel sets in rn to be those sets that are derived from the set of all open sets in rn through the operations of countable union countable intersection and set difference then a measure on rn is a radon measure if 20 1 every borel set is measurable i e is a borel measure 2 for each a rn there exists a borel set b such that a b and a b i e is borel regular 3 for each compact set k rn k i e is locally finite 25 hausdorff measure with this outer radon measure we can measure k dimensional subsets of rn k n while it is true that ln hn for n n see section 2 2 of 20 hausdorff measure hk is also defined for k 0 so that even sets as wild as fractals are measurable in a meaningful way to compute the k dimensional hausdorff measure of a rn 1 cover a with a collection of sets e ei i 1 where diam ei d i 2 compute the k dimensional measure of that cover vke a i k diam ei 2 k where k is the k volume of the unit k ball 3 define hkd a infe v k e a where the infimum is taken over all covers whose elements have maximal diameter d 4 finally we define hk a limd 0 hkd a diam e i k diam ei 2 k figure 15 the hausdorff measure is derived from a cover of arbitrary sets approximate tangent plane we present here an approximate tangent k plane based on integration the one dimensional version is of course an approx imate tangent line we start with the fact that we can integrate functions defined on rn over k dimensional sets using k dimensional measures typi cally hk we zoom in on the point p through dilation of the set f 26 f p x rn x y p p for some y f we will say that the set f has an approximate tangent k plane l at p if the dilation of f p converges weakly to l i e if f d l d as 0 for all continuously differentiable compactly supported
