with a strongly closed subgroup this spectral sequence is related to the lyndon hochschild serre spectral sequence and coincides with it for the case of an extension of groups nevertheless the new spectral sequence applies to more general situations like finite simple groups with a strongly closed subgroup and exotic fusion systems with a strongly closed subgroup we prove an analogue of a result of stallings in the context of fusion preserving homomorphisms and deduce tate s p nilpotency criterion as a corollary 1 introduction let keg be a normal subgroup of the finite group g and consider the extension k g g k the lyndon hochschild serre spectral sequence of this short exact sequence is an important tool to analyze the cohomology of g with coefficients in the zg module m it has second page e n m 2 h n g k hm k m with g k acting on hm k m and converges to hn m g m our aim in this work is to construct a related spectral sequence in the context of fusion systems this concept was originally introduced by puig and developed by broto levi and oliver in 2 to where we refer the reader for notation it consists of a category f with objects the subgroups of a finite p group s and morphisms bounded by axioms that mimic properties of conjugation morphisms in the setup of fusion systems the concept of short exact sequence is an evasive one let f be a fusion system over the p group s for a strongly f closed subgroup t of s there is a quotient fusion system f t 7 5 10 nevertheless in general there is no normal fusion subsystem of f that would play the role of the kernel of the morphism of fusion systems f f t 1 8 11 ff so the answer to 17 conjecture 11 is negative and one cannot expect to construct a lyndon hochschild serre spectral sequence for fusion systems here we are able to construct a spectral sequence that converges to the cohomology of f h f m where m is a z p module with trivial action of s recall that h f m is defined 2 section 5 as the following subring of f stable elements in h s m h s m f z h s m res z z for each homf p s where res h s m h p m is restriction in cohomology date september 25 2018 partially supported by feder mci grant mtm

module with trivial s action then there is a first quadrant cohomological spectral sequence with second page e n m 2 h n s t hm t m f and converging to hn m f m the notation f for the second page will be fully described in section 2 and must be thought as taking f stable elements in a similar way as explained for h f m above consider for each subgroup p of s the lyndon hochschild serre spectral sequence of the extension p t p p p t pt t converging to h p m a morphism homf p q induces a morphism between the spectral sequences corresponding to q and p hence we have a con travariant functor from f to the category of spectral sequences recall that a morphism in this category from e to e is a sequence of homomorphisms of differ ential bigraded z p modules fk e k e k k 0 such that h fk fk 1 the inverse limit spectral sequence or spectral sequence of f stable elements has e n m 2 entry equal to hn s t hm t m f i e the elements z from hn s t hm t m such that z res z where homf p s and res is restriction in cohomology for the inclusion p s hence h s t h t m f is a differential graded subalgebra of the differential graded algebra h s t h t m and its differential is just restriction of the differential of the latter this should be useful in computations the theorem states that the abutment of this spectral sequence is h f m for the case of a normal subgroup k eg and f fs g with s sylp g we have two spectral sequences converging to h g m here m is a z p module with trivial g action and hence trivial s action on the one hand we have the lyndon hochschld serre spectral sequence associated to k g g k on the other hand we have the spectral sequence associated to f and the strongly f closed subgroup t k s sylp k in section 5 we prove that the two spectral sequences are isomorphic note that in particular this shows that the lyndon hochschild serre spectral sequence of the extension k g g k depends only on the intersection of k with a sylow p subgroup of g as an application of the spectral sequence in theorem 1 1 we prove an ana logue of a result of stallings meanwhile the original theorem deals with a group homomorphism here we replace that notion by that of a fusion preserving homo morphism this is a group homomorphism s 1 s 2 between the sylow p subgroups of two fusion systems f 1 and f 2 such that morphisms of f 1 are transformed into morphisms of f 2 see section 6 1 2 theorem 16 p 170 let fi be a fusion system over the p group si for i 1 2 and let s 1 s 2 be a fusion preserving homomorphism if the induced map in cohomology hi f 2 fp h i f 1 fp is isomorphism for i 1 and monomorphism for i 2 then s 1 o p f 1 s 1 s 2 o p f 2 s 2 2 the hyperfocal subgrop of fi o p fi si i 1 2 is defined as follows o p fi si p o p autfi p p si it is the smallest subgroup of si such that the quotient of fi over that subgroup is a p group 3 hence the conclusion of the theorem is that the largest p group quotients of f 1 and f 2 are isomorphic for instance when f 1 and f 2 are already p groups i e fi fsi si i 1 2 the conclusion is that s 1 and s 2 are isomorphic this particular case is a variant of stallings result by evens 10 7 2 4 we can also deduce fusion system versions of another result of evens and tate s p nilpotency criterion 1 3 corollary 10 7 2 5 let f be a fusion system over the p group s if the map h 2 f e p f s fp h 2 f fp is a monomorphism then s o p f s is elementary abelian here the elementary focal subgroup of f is defined as e p f s s o p f s 8 where s is the frattini subgroup of s the conclusion of this corollary is that the largest p group quotient of f is elementary abelian 1 4 corollary 18 corollary p 109 let f be a fusion system over the p group s if the restriction map h 1 f fp h 1 s fp is an isomorphism then f fs s this last result was already proven in 8 using transfer for fusion systems and in 5 by topological methods here the proof mimics tate s cohomological orig inal proof that relies on the five terms exact sequence associated to the lyndon hochschild serre spectral sequence but using instead the spectral sequence of the orem 1 1 there are situations where the lyndon hochschild serre spectral sequence is not applicable while the spectral sequence from theorem 1 1 can be utilized for instance a classical drawback of the lyndon hochschild serre spectral sequence is that it cannot be applied to finite simple groups nevertheless there are finite simple groups that do have a strongly closed p subgroup in 11 flores and foote classified all finite groups with a strongly closed p subgroup in particular they stated which finite simple groups have a stronly closed p subgroup notice that even if f is induced from a non simple finite group f fs g not every strongly closed f subgroup t of s is of the form t k s for some normal subgroupkeg 1 example 6 4 this describes another circumstances where lyndon hochschild serre does not apply but theorem 1 1 does as final example of this situation consider exotic fusion system with a strongly closed p subgroup a family of such exotic fusion systems is described in 9 where the authors classified all the fusion systems over p groups of p rank 2 p odd this opens a new range of cohomology computations that can be carried out some of which the author intends to perform in a subsequent paper the main limitation here is that the spectral sequence from theorem 1 1 requires they knowl edge of the lyndon hochschild serre spectral sequence of the extension of p groups t s s t and these computations do not abound 1 5 remark theorem 1 1 holds for the wider class of f stable z p s modules i e for z p s modules m such that for any morphism p s in f and any p p we have p m p m also the lyndon hochschild serre spectral sequence of keg and the spectral sequence from theorem 1 1 for f fs g and 3 t s k coincide for g stable z p g modules i e for z p g modules m such that g 1 hg m h m for any h g g organization of the paper in section 2 f stable elements and mackey func tors are defined and some related results introduced in section 3 we describe a particular cohomological mackey functor that will play a central role in the con struction of the spectral sequence in section 4 the spectral sequence is built and theorem 1 1 is proven as theorem 4 1 in section 5 we compare the spectral se quence from theorem 1 1 to the lyndon hochschild serre spectral sequence and we give an example in section 6 we prove stallings result and its corollaries acknowledgments i would like to thank a viruel for several fruitful conver sations when developing this paper also i am grateful to p symonds for showing me how to prove that in the normal subgroup case the two spectral sequences coincide theorem 5 1 2 cohomology and f stable elements throughout this section f denotes a fusion system over the p group s we start introducing some notation if a f c is a contravariant functor and c is any category then by we denote the value a for a morphism in f for sp the inclusion of p into s we write res sp if c is a complete category then we denote by af the inverse limit over f of this functor af lim f a for the complete category cch ab of unbounded cochain complexes we have the following favourable description of inverse limits 2 1 lemma let a f cch ab be a contravariant functor then af a s f z a s res z z for each homf p s a s we call the elements in a s f the f stable elements in a s for such a functor we can consider the cohomology h af h a s f of a s f cch ab notice that we also have functors hn a f ab obtained by taking cohomology at degree n hence we may also consider the inverse limits h a f h a s f we are interested in functors a for which taking f stable elements and cohomology commute we prove in this section proposition 2 10 that being a cohomological mackey functor definition 2 2 with values in z p modules is sufficient 2 2 definition let f be a saturated fusion system over the p group s and let a be an abelian category a cohomological mackey functor for f over a is a pair of functors a b f a with a f a contravariant and b f a covariant such that 1 a p b p anda b 1 for each p s and homf p p 2 identity a cp b cp a p a p are the identity morphisms for every p p s where cp p p x 7 pxp 1 is conjugation by p 3 double coset formula a pq b p r x q p r b q q xr a xr q xr a cx 1 xr for q r p s where q p r are the double cosets 4 cohomological b q p a q p a q a q is multiplication by q p for every p q s 4 see 19 for the classical definition of mackey functor and of cohomological mackey functor for finite groups 2 3 remark in definition 2 2 we have omitted the familiar conditions transitivity b rq b q p b r p a q p a r q a r p for p q r s and conjugation b q p a p a b q p b p a q p a q p b for p q s homf q q in fact they are consequence of the functoriality of a and b and of condition 1 we will use several times along the paper that cohomology of finite groups is a cohomological mackey functor for a proof of this fact see 4 for example 2 4 remark if the maps b q p for the inclusions q p p q with p q s are given these maps are called transfer we can define b as follows for any morphism homf p q define b a p a q by b b q p a 1 with p p such a b becomes functorial if for any p q r we have b rq b q p b r p and for any p q q we have b q p a p a b q p before proving the main result of this section we need to introduce g h bisets sets with commuting free right g action and free left h action every g h biset can be decomposed into a disjoint union of transitive g h bisets of the form h g h g with k g k h a monomorphism and h kg h k g for h h g g and k k a saturated fusion system gives rise to a special type of biset 2 5 proposition 2 proposition 5 5 for any saturated fusion system f over a p group s there is an s s biset with the following properties a each transitive component of is of the form s s for some p s and homf p s b for each p s and each homf p s the p s biset p obtained by restricting the right action from s to p and the p s biset obtained by restricting the right action from s to p via are isomorphic as p s bisets c s 1 modp we call such an s s biset an f stable s s biset now let a b f a be a cohomological mackey functor for f over the abelian category a for each transitive q r biset r q with homf p r p q s r s we have the composition 2 6 a r a a p b p b q p b q a q for each q r biset with r q 5 we can define a map a a r a q by 2 7 a b a 2 8 lemma let a b f a be a cohomological mackey functor then 1 for each transitive q r biset r q the morphism 2 6 depends only on the isomorphism class of r q as q r biset 2 for any q r biset the morphism 2 7 depends only on the isomor phism class of as q r biset 3 for any q r biset and any monomorphism p q we have a a a where is the p r biset obtained by restricting the right action of from q to p via 4 if a z p mod and is an f stable s s biset then a s f im a a s a s proof proof of 1 the transitive q r bisets r 1 q and r 2 q with 1 p 1 r 2 p 2 r p 1 p 2 q are isomorphic as q r bisets if and only if there exist elements q q and r r such that the following diagram commutes p 1 cq 1 r cr p 2 2 r hence both squares in the following diagram commute a r a 1 a p 1 b q p 1 b cq a q b cq a r a cr oo a 2 a p 2 a cq oo b q p 2 a q using 1 and 2 from definition 2 2 one finds out that b q p 1 a 1 b q p 2 a 2 proof of 2 any automorphism of permutes its transitive components via isomorphisms so we may apply 1 from the lemma to each component proof of 3 write as a disjoint union of transitive q r bisets r q the transitive q r biset r q with k r k q decomposes as a p r biset with p acting via as follows r q q p q k r c q 1 p with p p 1 qk p qk c q 1 k r hence a q p q k b pp 1 qk a cq 1 6 using functoriality of a and b we get a a q p q k b p p qk a cq 1 a with p p now the mackey decomposition 3 from definition 2 2 gives a a a q p b q k a a a proof of 4 let z a s we want to see that a z a s f so let be a morphism in homf p s then a a z a a z a z by 3 by 2 5 b the p s bisets and s p p are isomorphic as p s bisets then by 2 we have a a s p hence a a z a z a s p z a sp a z by 3 thus a z a s f now let z a s f then a z b a z b a z as z is f stable now by 4 of definition 2 2 we get a z s p z and by 2 5 c the number q s p s is a p number so a z q z and hence z ima for a fusion system f over the p group s denote by cohmackz p f the abelian category with objects the cohomological mackey functors with values in z p mod and morphisms the natural transformations commuting with both the contravariant and covariant parts this means that if a b and a b are cohomological mackey functors a morphism between them consists of a morphism of z p modules p a p a p for each p s such that for homf p q we have a q p a and q b b p 2 9 lemma let f be a fusion system over the p group s then the functor cohmackz p f f z p mod sending a b 7 a f is exact proof let 0 a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 a 3 b 3 0 be an exact sequence in cohmackz p f we want to prove that 0 a f 1 a f 2 f af 3 0 is exact in z p mod the non trivial equality to prove is that the arrow af 2 a f 3 is an epimorphism so let z be an f stable element in a 3 s fix an s s biset satisfying the properties of proposition 2 5 by lemma 2 8 4 there exists an element z a 3 s with z a 3 z by hypothesis the map a 2 s s a 3 s is an epimorphism and hence there exists an element y a 2 s with s y z by lemma 2 8 4 again we have that y def a 2 y belongs to af 2 because 7 commutes with the covariant and contravariant parts of a 2 b 2 and a 3 b 3 is easy to see that f y f a 2 y a 3 f y a 3 z z 2 10 proposition let f be a fusion system over s and let a b f cch z p be a cohomological mackey functor then h a s f h a s f proof this is a consequence of the previous lemma and of the well known fact that cohomology commutes with exact functors 2 11 remark let f be a fusion system over the p group s and let m be a trivial z p s module by 2 section 5 the cohomology of f is defined as h f m h s m f where h m f z p modules is the cohomological mackey functor with values h p m if one could choose cochains c m f cch z p such that c m was the contravariant part of a cohomological mackey functor then proposition 2 10 would give the computational purposes formula h f m h c s m f in the next section some problems related to the functoriality of cochains will become apparent 3 a mackey functor let f be a fusion system over the p group s t a strongly f closed subgroup of s and m a z p module with trivial s action in this section we prove that for every n m 0 the functor hn m f z p mod sending the subgroup p s to hn p p t hm p t m is the contravariant part of a cohomological mackey functor f cch 2 z p with values in double cochain complexes definition 2 2 here by double complexes we mean the abelian category with objects families of z p modules a n m n m z together with maps d h horizontal differential and dv vertical differential dh an m an 1 m and dv an m an m 1 such that dhdh dvdv dhdv dvdh 0 a morphism from an m n m z to a n m n m z is a family of maps of z p modules a n m a n m n m z that commute with horizontal and vertical differentials for p s denote by p the group p p t the bar resolutions b p and b p for p and p respectively are projective resolutions of the trivial module z p over z p p and z p p respectively recall that the bar resolution is functorial covariant over finite groups and homomorphisms define a p as the double complex associated to the short exact sequence 0 p t p p pt t 0 more precisely for n 0 and m 0 we define an m p homp b n p bmp m where p acts on bn p bmp by p y x py px for y b n p and x bmp 8 as the action of p on m is trivial the cochains in an m p are the homomor phisms f hom bn p bmp m such that f py px f y x for all y bn p x bmp and p p to obtain a double complex we consider the following horizontal and vertical differentials for f an m p dh f y x 1 n m 1 f d y x y bn 1 p x bmp and dv f y x 1 m 1 f y d x y bn p x bm 1 p where we are using the differential d of the complexes b p and b p we choose the signs as in 13 xi 10 1 to ensure that dhdv dvdh 0 we will obtain the functor hn m by taking vertical cohomology followed by horizontal cohomology in an m to define a on morphisms notice that any morphism homf p q takes p t to q t as t is strongly f closed hence it induces a homomorphism p q thus for any homf p q we may define an m q an m an m p mapping the cochain f an m q to the cochain in an m p that takes y bn p and x bmp to f bn y bm x where bn and bm are the usual morphisms between bar resolutions they commute with differentials and satisfy bn p y p bn y for every y bn p and every p p and bm p x p bm x for every x bmp and p p it is straightforward that a n m f an m p and that the family of morphisms an m n m 0 commutes with the horizontal and vertical differentials of the double complexes a q and a p 3 1 remark by definition the fusion system f t is defined over the p group s t for t p q s the morphisms in homf t p t q t are those homomorphisms p t q t induced on the quotient from homf p q for p q s and homf p q we have a morphism p q then we have a commutative diagram p q pt t qt t where s are induced by and where the vertical arrows are the natural isomor phisms according to 7 5 10 bottom morphism belongs to f t i e there exists homf pt qt such that the induced map pt t qt t coincides with the given one 9 3 2 remark the construction of an m is clearly functorial and hence so far we have a contravariant functor a f cch 2 z p with values in double complexes now we define bn m p an m p for every p s and n m 0 for each morphism homf p q we will define a morphism of double complexes bn m an m p an m q this will not make b into a covariant functor f cch 2 z p as the definition depends on a choice of representatives never theless b will become functorial once we pass to cohomology to define b on homf p q write where p p is an isomorphism and is the inclusion p q and set 3 3 b b a 1 so we just need to define b on inclusions so let be the inclusion between subgroups p q of s there are maps of z p p chain complexes and of z p p chain complexes respectively q p b q b p q p b q b p built as in 4 d page 82 more precisely the map q p is induced by a map of left p sets q p defined as follows fix a set of representatives for the right cosets p q then q qq 1 where q is the representative with pq pq the map q p is defined analogously choosing representatives for the right cosets p q these choices of representatives prevent bp q from being functorial we define the map bn m homp b n p bmp m homq b n q bmq m by 3 4 bn m f y x w q p f q pn w 1 y q pm w 1 x where w runs over a set of representatives of the left cosets q p this formula can be thought as a relative transfer formula for twisted coefficients clearly its defini tion does not depend on the representatives w chosen and bn m f an m q moreover bn m commutes with both the horizontal and vertical differentials as and do and so it is a map of double complexes 3 5 remark by 14 there are finite groups g and g such that s is a p subgroup of g not necessarily a sylow p subgroup s s t is a p subgroup of g not necessarily a sylow p subgroup and with f fs g and f t fs g let b g and b g be the bar resolutions of g and g respectively then we could have defined for p s an m p homp b n g bmg m where p acts on bn g bmg by restricting the actions of g on b g and of g on b g this means that p y x py px for p p in this setup clearly one can define a functorial bn m on inclusions on the other hand to realize a morphism p q we need to choose g ng p q with cg and g ng p q with cg and then define an m y x gy gx 10 it is clear that in general an m defined this way will not be functorial on morphisms if one could choose an m and bn m such that an m bn m f cch 2 z p was a mackey functor then the proof of theorem 4 1 would be simpler on each double complex a p with p s we may take vertical cohomology followed by horizontal cohomology to obtain h p h p t m 13 equation 10 2 page 352 for any homomorphism homf p q the maps a and b are maps of double complexes and hence they induce maps hn m a hn q hm q t m hn p hm p t m and hn m b hn p hm p t m hn q hm q t m 3 6 lemma for p q the map hn m a factors as hn q hm q t m hn hn p hm q t m hm hn p hm p t m where hn is the map induced by in cohomology with hm q t m coefficients hm is the map induced by the change of coefficients hm hm q t m hm p t m this map is a map of z p p modules where p acts on h m q t m via p p q proof by construction 3 7 lemma if p q and denotes the inclusion then the map hn m b factors as hn p hm p t m hm tr hn p hm q t m hn tr hn q hm q t m where hn tr is the transfer map in cohomology with hm q t m coefficients hm tr is the map induced by the change of coefficients given by the trans fer map in cohomology hm tr hm p t m hm q t m this map is a map of z p p modules where p acts on h m q t m via p q proof choose representatives zi q of the left cosets q p and representatives tj q t of the left cosets q t p t choose also representatives qk q of the left cosets q q q t then each zi q is represented as zi qki for a unique ki it is an exercise to prove that the set of elements of q qkitj for all i and j is a set of representatives of q p then we can rewrite equation 3 4 as zi q p tj q t p t f q pn qkitj 1 y q pm qkitj 1 x because tj q t then qkitj qki and the formula simplifies to zi q p tj q t p t f q pn qki 1 y q pm t 1 j qki 1 x 11 this coincides with the composition in the statement of the lemma lemma 3 7 proves in particular that the definition of hn m b does not de pend on the representatives chosen to construct the maps q p and q p although bn m do depends on them 3 8 corollary for n m 0 the assignment hn m b f z p mod taking p to hn p hm p t m and taking homf p q to h n m b is a functor proof by remarks 2 4 and 3 2 and equation 3 3 it is enough to prove that for any p q r we have hn m b rq h n m b q p h n m b rp and for any p q q we have hn m b q p h n m a p h n m a hn m b q p we can check both conditions at the level of cochains for the first condition the definitions 3 4 of bn m q p b n m rq and b n m rp depend upon choices of representatives for the right cosets p q and p q q r and q r and p r and p r respectively fix choices of representatives for the first four right cosets then the bijections p q q r p r and p q q r p r provide choices for the last two right cosets with these choices we have bn m rq b n m q p b n m rp for the second condition the maps bn m q p and b n m q p depend on choices of representatives for the right cosets p q and p q and p q and p q respectively fix representatives in p q and p q and force the other choices via the bijections p q p q and p q p q then we have bn m q p a n m p a n m a bn m q p 3 9 proposition for each p q 0 the functor f z p mod with values hp p hq p t m and taking homf p q to h p q a is a cohomological mackey functor with covariant part taking homf p q to h p q b proof property 1 from definition 2 2 holds by equation 3 3 property 2 follows from property 1 the well known fact that conjugation induces the identity on cohomology from lemma 3 6 and from cp cp for p p s now we check property 3 also known as mackey condition or double coset formula so let q r p s we will prove this condition at the level of cochains i e an m pq b n m pr x q p r bn m q q xr a n m xr q xr a n m cx 1 xr 12 so let f an m r homr b n r bmr m y b n q and x bmq then an m pq b n m pr f y x b n m pr f p q y p q x b n m pr f y x this equals w p r f p rn w 1 y p rm w 1 x where w runs over a set of representatives of the left cosets p r p rn b n p bn r and p rm b m p b m r now we let q acts on the left on p r and we group together the terms corresponding to a given q orbit in p r p q p r q q q pr f p rn qp 1 y p rm qp 1 x where now p runs over a set of representatives for the double cosets q p r and q runs over a set of representatives of the left cosets q q nr this equals p q p r q q q pr f p rn p 1 q 1 y p rm p 1 q 1 x the right hand side of the mackey formula is p q p r q q q pr f p 1 q q pr n q 1 y p p 1 q q pr q q 1 x p with q q pr n b n q bn q pr q q pr m b m q b m q pr and where we have realized cp 1 pr at the level of cochains as an m cp 1 pr y x p 1 yp p 1 xp the map p rm depends on a choice of representatives for the right cosets r p analogously for any representative p q p r the map q q pr m is built out of a set of representatives of q pr q we want to choose representatives of r p and of q pr q for each double coset qpr such that q p q 7 p 1 q q pr q 7 p 1 qp p r commutes for each double coset qpr for this is enough to choose arbitrary repre sentatives q of q pr q for each double coset qpr and build the representatives in r p via the bijection p q p r q pr q r p that takes q pr q to rp 1 q the same argument for p rn and the maps q q pr n finishes the proof of property 3 to prove property 4 we go back to the level of cohomology let p q s by lemmas 3 6 and 3 7 the composition hn m b q p h n m a q p is equal to hn tr hm tr hm q p h n q p 13 because cohomology over finite groups is a cohomological mackey functor we know that hm tr hm q p is multiplication by q t p t moving out this factor we are left with hn tr hn q p as q p q p we obtain again by properties of cohomology for finite groups that this composition is multiplication by q p so finally we obtain that hn m b q p h p q a q p is multiplication by q t p t q p q p 4 construction of the spectral sequence in this section we prove the main theorem of this paper 4 1 theorem let f be a fusion system over the p group s t a strongly f closed subgroup of s and m a z p module with trivial s action then there is a first quadrant cohomological spectral sequence with second page e n m 2 h n s t hm t m f and converging to hn m f m proof for each subgroup p s we have the short exact sequence p t p p p p t the construction of the lyndon hochschild serre spectral sequence in 13 xi 10 1 associates to this short exact sequence a double complex naturally isomorphic to the double complex an m p homp b n p bmp m defined in section 3 this double complex we can filter either by columns or rows if we filter by columns we obtain a spectral sequence ce k p dk 0 k whose second page is ce n m 2 p h n p hm p t m if we filter by rows we obtain a spectral sequence re k p dk 0 k whose second page collapses as re n m 2 p hm p m for n 0 and re n

spectral se quences consisting of a sequence of morphism of differential bigraded z p modules ce k a ce k q ce k p ce k b ce k p ce k q and re k a re k q re k p re k b re k p re k q for 0 k we deal now with the filtration by columns spectral sequences the second page ce 2 is obtained by computing vertical cohomology followed by horizontal cohomology in in the double complex a hence we have ce n m 2 p h n p hm p t m ce n m 2 a h n m a and ce n m 2 b h n m b 14 for p s and homf p q where h n m a and hn m b are functors f z p mod by remark 3 2 and corollary 3 8 respectively hence for each 2 k we have a contravariant functor ce k a f differential bigraded z p modules and a covariant functor ce k b f differential bigraded z p modules on the one hand we can take invariants for each 2 k to obtain a differential bigraded z p module ce k f z ce k s ce k a z ce k a s p z for p s on the other hand for k 2 we have by proposition 3 9 that ce 2 a ce 2 b is a cohomological mackey functor because ce k 1 h ce k dk and because passing to cohomology preserves cohomological mackey functors we deduce that ce k a is a cohomological mackey functor with covariant part ce k b for 2 k by proposition 2 10 we obtain then that 4 2 ce k 1 f h ce k dk f h ce k f dk for 2 k fix now n 0 and m 0 for each subgroup p s we have ce n m k p ce n m k 1 p cen m p for k big enough because there are a finite number of subgroups of s we deduce that ce n m k f ce n m k 1 f cen m f for k big enough hence equation 4 2 also holds for k and we have obtained a spectral sequence ce k f dk 2 k to study whether this spectral sequence converges recall that for p s the spectral sequence ce k p dk 0 k converges to h p m hence we have short exact sequences 0 fnhn m p m fn 1 hn m p m cen m p 0 where 0 fnhn m p m fn 1 hn m p m hn m p m is the filtration induced on h p m by the filtration by columns on the double complex a p this short exact sequence is natural with respect to morphisms of double complexes hence for each homf p q we have morphisms of short exact sequences 0 fnhn m q m fnhn m a fn 1 hn m q m fn 1 hn m a cen m q cen m a 0 0 fnhn m p m fn 1 hn m p m cen m p 0 15 and 0 fnhn m p m fnhn m b fn 1 hn m p m fn 1 hn m b cen m p cen m b 0 0 fnhn m q m fn 1 hn m q m cen m q 0 we want to show that the morphisms hn a hn q m hn p m and hn b hn p m hn q m induced by a and b on the targets of the spectral sequences are the usual maps in cohomology of groups we consider the total complex of the double complex a p defined as usual by tots a n m sa n m p and with total differential dh dv there is a chain map given by homp b p m tot a sending f homp b m p m to f a 0 m defined by f p x f x p p x bmp the map induces an isomorphism between the cohomology of the total com plex and h p m cf 13 p 352 now from the definitions of the maps a 0 m a 0 m q a 0 m p and b 0 m q p a 0 m p a 0 m q it is easy to check that hn a and hn b q p are the usual maps in cohomology of groups see 4 d page 82 by properties of cohomology for finite groups hn a hn b f z p mod is a cohomological mackey functor for each n 0 hence so are the functors fnhn m a fnhn m b f z p mod induced in the filtration for n m 0 by the arguments above also the pair cen m a cen m b f z p mod is a cohomological mackey functor for n m 0 then by lemma 2 9 we have a short exact sequence of z p modules 0 fnhn m f fn 1 hn m f cen m f 0 it is immediate that taking invariants and filtering commute and hence we have 0 fn hn m f fn 1 hn m f cen m f 0 for the filtration ofhn m f hn m s f given by fn hn m f fn hn m s hn m s f this finishes the proof 4 3 remark we have seen in the proof that for each 2 k the pair ce k a ce k b f differential bigraded z p modules is a cohomological mackey functor moreover ce k a ce k b 2 k is a spectral sequence of mackey functors that converges as a mackey functor to the usual cohomology of finite groups mackey functor h a h b f z p mod 5 comparison in this section we compare our spectral sequence and lyndon hochschild serre spectral sequence let g be a finite group keg and s sylp g then t k s is a sylow p subgroup of k moreover t is strongly fs g closed fix a z p module m with trivial g action the lyndon hochschild serre spectral sequence e g of the extension k g g k is hn g k hm k m hn m g m 16 meanwhile the spectral sequence e from theorem 1 1 associated to t is hn s t hm t m fs g hn m f m note that by the classical stable elements theorem 6 xii 10 1 attributed to tate by cartan and eilenberg h g m h f m and both spectral sequences converge to the same target recall that by construction e is a sub spectral sequence of the lyndon hochschild serre spectral sequence e s of t s s t 5 1 theorem the spectral sequences e g and e are isomorphic proof consider the category fg g with objects the subgroups of g and mor phisms given by morfg g h i homg h i clearly fs g is a full subcate gory of fg g for each subgroup h g we have a short exact sequence h k h h h h k if cg h i is a morphism in fg g then as k is normal in g conjugation by g g takes h k h h to i k i i exactly the same construction of section 3 gives a cohomological mackey functor a b fg g cch 2 z p with values h 7 an m h homh b n h bmh m where b h and b h are the bar resolutions for h and h respectively moreover for h s as t k s we have h k h t and this functor over fg g extends the one built in section 3 over fs g the inclusion of the short exact sequence t s s t into k g g k gives a morphism resr r 2 of spectral sequences from e g into e s the mor phism of differential graded algebras res 2 e 2 g e 2 s coincides with the mor phism induced in cohomology by the functor a applied to the inclusion morphism s g of fg g h a gs applying the functor b to the same inclusion s g we get another morphism going in the opposite direction transfer hn g k hm k m hn m a gs hn s t hm t m hn m b gs ii recall that e 2 e 2 s are exactly the f stable elements h p s t hq t m fs g because conjugation by g g induces the identity on hp g k hq k m it is straightforward that res 2 e 2 g e 2 hence resr r 2 is a morphism of spectral sequences e g e if we prove that res 2 e 2 g e 2 then res 2 is an isomor phism and hence resr is an isomorphism for each r 2 and we are done to see that res 2 e 2 g e 2 we proceed as usual when there is a mackey functor avail able cf 4 theorem iii 10 3 let z hn s t hm t m fs g and consider w hn m b gs z h n g k hm k m by the double coset formula 2 2 3 17 and the cohomological condition 2 2 4 and because z is fs g stable we obtain hn m a gs w x s g s b ss xs a xs s xs c x 1 z x s g s b ss xs a s s xs z x s g s s s xs z g s z as q g s is a p number it follows that z res w q 5 2 example consider the symmetric group on 6 letters s 6 it has sylow 2 subgroup s c 2 d 8 where d 8 is the dihedral group of order 8 because a 6 e s 6 the subgroup t s a 6 d 8 is strongly closed in f fs s 6 in this example we describe the lyndon hochshild serre spectral sequence of a 6 s 6 c 2 interpreted as the spectral sequence e of theorem 1 1 applied to f and t this demonstrates how the new spectral sequence works in the fusion system f there are three f centric an f radical subgroups namely s p c 32 and q c 3 2 the intersections p t and q t are the two klein subgroups of t d 8 the automorphisms are autf s 1 and autf p autf q s 3 the symmetric group on 3 letters denote by e s e p and e q the lyndon hochschild serre spectral sequences of the extensions t s c 2 p t p c 2 and q t q c 2 respectively all three extensions are direct products and hence all differentials are 0 and the three spectral sequences collapse at the second page in particular the ring h s f 2 is isomorphic as a ring to e 2 s and hence h s 6 f 2 is isomorphic as a ring to e 2 moreover for the invariants we have e 2 e 2 s f e 2 s res s p 1 e 2 p s 3 ressq 1 e 2 q s 3 because it is enough to consider invariants with respect to f centric and f radical subgroups by alperin s fusion theorem here ressp e 2 s e 2 p and res s q e 2 s e 2 q are the restriction maps denoting by subscripts the degrees we have the fol lowing e 2 s h d 8 f 2 h c 2 f 2 f 2 x 1 y 1 w 2 xy f 2 u e 2 p h c 22 f 2 h c 2 f 2 f 2 x 1 x

p acts on p t c 2 2 and on the quotient c 2 p p t the induced action on h c 22 f 2 is the natural one and on h c 2 f 2 the only possibility is the trivial action hence the invariants are given by e 2 p s 3 f 2 x 1 x 1 s 3 f 2 u f 2 d 2 d 3 f 2 u 18 where d 2 x 2 x 2 xx and d 3 x x xx are the dickson s invariants analogously we have that e 2 q s 3 f 2 e 2 e 3 f 2 u with e 2 y 2 y 2 yy and e 3 y y yy it is straightforward that d 2 res s p x 2 w d 3 res s p xw e 2 res s q y 2 w and e 3 res s q yw from this it is immediate that f 2 x 2 y 2 w xw yw f 2 u e 2 to check the reversed inclusion we first consider stable elements in the polynomial algebras f 2 x w and f 2 y w as in 12 lemma 1 4 6 the restrictions res s p f 2 x w and ressq f 2 y w are injective and so f 2 x w res s p 1 e 2 p s 3 f 2 x 2 w xw and f 2 y w res s q 1 e 2 q s 3 f 2 y 2 w yw a class v of hn d 8 f 2 can be written as follows where we set k n 2 v k i 0 iw ixn 2 i iw iyn 2 i from the discussion above we have that if v is f invariant then v wk 2 i 3 j n i x 2 w i xw j i y 2 w i yw j where 0 for n odd and k k k k if n is even if n is odd then the equalities x 2 y 2 w xw x 2 w xw and x 2 y 2 w yw y 2 w yw give that v f 2 x 2 y 2 w xw yw if n is even then the only term left to consider is k x 2 w k k y 2 w k wk k x 2 w k y 2 w k wk and an easy induction shows that x 2 w k y 2 w k wk x 2 y 2 w k so e 2 f 2 x 2 y 2 w xw yw f 2 u the corner of e 2 is xw yw xwu ywu xwu 2 ywu 2 x 2 y 2 w x 2 y 2 w u x 2 y 2 w u 2 0 0 0 1 u u 2 and we deduce that h s 6 f 2 f 2 u 1 a 2 b 3 c 3 bc with generators a x 2 y 2 w b xw and c yw 6 stallings theorem associated to every first quadrant spectral sequence there is a five terms exact sequence in the case of the lyndon hochschild serre spectral sequence for k eg and the g module m we obtain the inflation restriction exact sequence 6 1 0 h 1 g k mk h 1 g m h 1 k m g k h 2 g k mk h 2 g m where the second arrow from the right is the transgression before introducing the five terms exact sequence for the spectral sequence of theorem 1 1 we introduce some notation so let f be a fusion system over the p group s with a strongly closed f subgroup t set t f t t t homf u t t where 19 t t t 1 t p tp t t which is characteristic in t and the commutator subgroup t s t 1 s 1 ts t t and s s e t because the element wise product t p t s is a normal subgroup of t the element wise product t p s t r is a subgroup of t for any r t for instance t p t s t f t p t f t the five terms exact sequence for the spectral sequence of theorem 1 1 for f t and the z p module m with trivial s action is the following 6 2 0 h 1 s t m f h 1 f m h 1 t m f h 2 s t m f h 2 f m where the arrow h 1 t m f h 2 s t m f is the transgression for coefficients m fp we have 6 3 h 1 f fp h 1 s fp f hom s sp s f fp and 6 4 h 1 t fp f hom t t p t f fp we also have 6 5 h 1 s t m f h 1 s t m f t and h 2 s t m f h 2 s t m f t by remark 3 1 if fi is a fusion system over the p group si for i 1 2 a homomorphism of groups s 1 s 2 is fusion preserving if for each homf 1 p s 1 there exists homf 2 p s 2 such that it is easy to see that such a homomorphism induces a map in cohomologyh f 2 fp h f 1 fp in fact by the work of ragnarsson 15 it induces a map even at the level of stable classifying spaces assume in addition that induces a map of short exact sequences t 1 s 1 s 1 t 1 t 2 s 2 s 2 t 2 where ti is strongly closed in si with respecto to fi for i 1 2 this is equivalent to assume that t 1 t 2 denote by ei the spectral sequence from theorem 1 1 applied to the strongly closed subgroup ti for i 1 2 then induces a morphism of spectral sequences e 2 e 1 and in particular a map of five terms exact sequences 6 6 theorem 16 let fi be a fusion system over the p group si for i 1 2 and let s 1 s 2 be a fusion preserving homomorphism define si 0 si and si n 1 s p i n si n fi for i 1 2 and n 0 if the induced map in cohomology hi f 2 fp h i f 1 fp is isomorphism for i 1 and monomorphism for i 2 then s 1 s 1 n s 2 s 2 n for each n 1 in particular for n big enough we obtain that s 1 o p f 1 s 1 s 2 o p f 2 s 2 proof we will prove by induction that s 1 s 1 n s 2 s 2 n and that si n is strongly fi closed and contains o p fi si for i 1 2 for the base case n 1 we have that si 1 contains o p fi si and is strongly fi closed by 8 corollary a 6 i 1 2 moreover by hypothesis h 1 f 2 fp h 1 f 1 fp and then by equation 6 3 we get s 1 s 1 1 s 2 s 2 1 20 now let n 1 as is fusion preserving it is easy to see that s 1 n s 2 n then we have the following map of short exact sequences s 1 n s 1 s 1 s 1 n s 2 n s 2 s 2 s 2 n by the induction hypothesis s 1 n and s 2 n are strongly closed in f 1 and f 2 respectively then by the discussion before the theorem we have a map of five terms short exact sequences in cohomology with trivial fp coefficients 0 h 1 s 1 s 1 n f 1 f 1 h 1 f 1 g 1 h 1 s 1 n f 1 h 1 h 2 s 1 s 1 n f 1 f 2 h 2 f 1 g 2 0 h 1 s 2 s 2 n f 2 h 1 f 2 h 1 s 2 n f 2 h 2 s 2 s 2 n f 2 h 2 f 2 because o p fi si is contained in si n the quotient f si n is a p group i e f si n fs si n s si n for i 1 2 then by equation 6 5 the maps f 1 and f 2 are isomorphisms as s 1 s 1 n s 2 s 2 n now by hypothesis g 1 is an isomorphism and g 2 is a monomorphism hence by the five lemma h 1 is an isomorphism then by equation 6 4 we obtain that s 1 n s 1 n 1 s 2 n s 2 n 1 and hence s 1 s 1 n 1 s 2 s 2 n 1 to finish the induction step denote by fi n the unique p power index fusion subsystem of fi on si n 3 theorem 4 3 then using 8 lemma a 5 we obtain that si n 1 s p i n si n si o p fi n si n and hence by 8 corollary a 14 si n 1 s p i n si n si o p fi si then si n 1 contains o p fi si and by 8 proposition a 7 1 si n 1 is strongly fi closed for i 1 2 for the second part of the statement recall that for any finite p group r the series r 0 r rn r p n 1 rn 1 r n 1 becomes trivial for n big enough then considering the image of si n in si o p f si it is easy to see that si n o p f si for n big enough and i 1 2 6 7 corollary 10 7 2 5 let f be a fusion system over the p group s if the map h 2 f e p f s fp h 2 f fp is a monomorphism then s o p f s is elementary abelian proof set f 1 f and f 2 f e p f s and consider the fusion preserving quotient map f 1 f 2 by equation 6 3 and because e p f s s o p f s s p s f the quotient map induces an isomorphism in degree 1 cohomology then theorem 6 6 gives that o p f s e p f s and we are done 6 8 corollary 18 let f be a fusion system over the p group s if the restric tion map h 1 f fp h 1 s fp is an isomorphism then f fs s proof consider f 1 fs s f 2 f and the fusion preserving morphism given by inclusion f 1 f 2 then h 1 f fp h 1 s fp is isomorphism by hypothesis and h 2 f fp h 2 s fp is monomorphism by definition then from theorem 6 6 we obtain o p f s 1 thus there are no p automorphisms in f and f fs s 21 references 1 aschbacher m normal subsystems of fusion systems plms 3 97 2008 pp 239 271 2 c broto r levi and b
