a construction on operads applicable to homology operations and the minimal model cole hugelmeyer october 9 2018 abstract we define a construction on operads which yields a new descrip tion of the minimal model the construction also allows us to define algebraic structures on the homology of chain complexes with homolo gously trivial operad algebra structures thus exposing nontrivial struc ture where none is apparent keywords operad minimal model homotopy algebra 1 introduction and notation in this paper we define a construction on symmetric operads which at taches a graded operad to a differential graded operad by universally letting the generators of the first operad differentiate to elements of the second we call the resulting operad a universal linking operad and we offer a com binatorial description of its presentation and homology this construction has many surprising properties for instance given a chain complex with a homologously trivial operad algebra structure we are able to construct non trivial algebra structures over the homology of a universal linking operad on the homology of the complex more surprisingly the minimal model of any operad can be constructed by an infinite iteration of the universal linking construction where the free operad on the lowest arity homology of the pre vious iteration is linked on at each step the notion of the minimal model of an operad arises naturally from attempts to define algebraic structures up to homotopy 3 1 7 and finds applications in string theory 5 the construction in this paper is therefore highly applicable to these areas be cause it offers a new perspective on the combinatorial nature of the minimal model in this paper all operads unless otherwise idicated are assumed to be graded by g we denote the free operad on a module g by g r we mean the operad cokernel of the map r g where it is assumed that r has a map to the underlying moodule of g let u be the forgetful 1 ar x iv 1 50 8 03 56 8 v 1 m at h a t 1 4 a ug 2 01 5 functor from operads to modules and let and be the unit and counit of adjunction between operads and modules respectively let gen o denote the minimal generating module of an operad o lower case s will denote suspension generally the structural maps for operads will be shortened to a ni 1 bi to mean element a of arity n composed with all bi all chain complexes are assumed to be only nontrivial in nonnegative degree we will often refer to the tree basis of a free operad see 6 7 when we do this assume we have chosen a invaritant basis of the generating module of the operad and the basis elements of the operad are composition trees with nodes decorated by these specified basis elements 2 chain complex adjunction let o be an operad in the category of graded vector spaces over a field k let and denote maps o u o s 1 u o given by the identification of o with the first term of the direct sum and second term of the direct sum respectively we define cho u o s 1 u o r where r is the ideal generated by the relations below a ni 1 bi a n i 1 bi n i 1 1 a i 1 j 1 bj a nj 1 ijbj 1 a ni 1 bi a n i 1 bi 2 where ij is when i j and otherwise proposition 2 1 the functor ch is a left adjoint to the forgetful functor v from chain complex operads to graded vector space operads proof given a graded vector space operad p and a chain copmplex operad q there is a natural map a hom p v q hom u p s 1 u p q given by the differential on q and the universal property for the free operad functor there is also a natural map b hom ch p q hom u p s 1 u p q given by composition with the canonical projection due to the chain homo morphicity conditions for the differential and the operad homomorphicity for the inclusion r is mapped trivially in the image of a which means the image a is the same as the image of b and since both a and b are injective this means that there is a natural bijection b a hom p v q hom chp q given by lifting a up b this yields an adjunction 2 proposition 2 2 let o g r be generated by generators g and relations r g then ch o g s 1 g r s 1 r proof relations 1 and 2 imply that any element of ch o can be factored into a composition of elements in g s 1 g cho by differentiating the relations for g we see that ch o must at least have the relations r s 1 r but from the universal property of the adjunction we see that these are the only relations proposition 2 3 for any operad o there is an isomorphism uch o uo s 1 uo with the differential given by 1 a 0 and when arity a n 1 a ni 1 bi a n i 1 bi proof let o g r as in proposition 2 2 with g uo we may then use the derivatives of the composition relations in g to express any composition tree in g s 1 g uniquely as a sum of trees which have only one element of g at the root and all other nodes in s 1 g to see this note that whenever an element of g appears further along the tree than an element of s 1 g an application of the derivative of a composition relation will give a signed sum of a tree with the differential switched to the farther node and a tree where the two nodes have been combined into something in s 1 g repeating this process will yield the desired result we have therefore constructed an epimorphism g s 1 g g s 1 g g s 1 uo which extends down to a map uch o uo s 1 uo we now see that the differential is the one we want by applying relation 1 to the trees in our construction to determine that is an isomorphism we observe that by construction the kernel of is the ideal generated by the composition relations and their derivatives corollary 2 1 for all operads o we have h cho 0 proof the chain complex described in proposition 2 3 is acyclic 3 universal linking operads let p and q be operads g r and g r respectively where q is equipped with a differential suppose we are given a map s 1 g u g then there are maps q ch s 1 g ch p we denote the chain operad pushforward of these maps by lu p q or just lu p q when is clear and call it the universal linking operad if q is 3 not a differential operad assume it is equipped with the trivial differential provided g p is injective and injects into ker there are injections p lu p q and q lu p q we will use the notation lug o lu sg o where g is a generating module for the operad o this is functorial in the category of operads paired with generating modules where morphisms must take one generating module into another we simplify our notation to lu o lugen o when there is an obvious choice of such as when the generators are concentrated in a single arity however keep in mind that gen is not functorial one should also note that the universal linking functor preserves coproducts because it is built out of a left adjoint and a colimit the name universal linking operad has been chosen because any chain complex operad o which contains both p and q and for which the generators of p differentiate to proper elements of q thus we think of o as linking p to q there is a unique map given by universal properties for ch and coker lu p q o in other words the universal linking operad is universal among operads which link p to q 3 1 homology computations it is not hard to find examples of universal linking operads with nontrivial homology for instance lu ass has nontrivial homology class given by s 1 1 where is the generator for ass we will see that the homology of lu ass is free on this generator and we will generalize the fact that this generator is the suspension of the associator in this section we give explicit combinatorial descriptions of the ho mology of universal linking operads to begin suppose o is an operad with generating module g let r denote the module suspension of ker ker p where p ch sg lugo and is the chainification differen tial and let r denote the desuspension of r suppose we choose a chain map r r ch sg which restricts to be the kernel of p furthermore we consider r g a generating module for g by setting r to zero we will now define an operad which will turn out to be isomorphic to the homology of lug o let a be the inclusion of ker p into ch sg and let b be the inclusion of ker ch sg into ch sg let f be the map b c ker p ker ch sg and let g be the map r ch g induced by finally we define rg o coker g f proposition 3 1 for all operads o generated by g there is an isomor phism h lugo rg o 4 proof we have the following commutative diagram with exact rows and columns here a p would denote the ideal generated by a in p in this diagram and are induced by the inclusion of r into ch sg by the long exact sequence in homology we see that the homology of any thing in the middle row is trivial and therefore the homology of things in the top row are differentials of the homology of things in the bottom row we will now show the homology of r ch r sg consists of differentials of elements of r suppose that k is a homology class for r ch r sg then for some h ch r sg we have k h without loss of generality h is a linear combination of composition trees which are linearly independent modulo ker and which are chosen so that each tree contains an element of r as one of its nodes and no tree contains an element of r looking at the definition for the differential for the chainification we see that we can write r s where r only differentiates the r nodes and s only differentiates the sg nodes also as differentiating does not change tree shape it is easy to see that the homology of ch r sg with respect to s is given by the elements which don t contain any sg nodes however as h r ch r sg we have that sh 0 so there exists a g such that h sg r furthermore we have h rh h sg r sg and we see that s r s 0 this allows us to see that s is defined on ker r r ch r sg and since s does not change tree shapes or alter nodes from r or r the homology of ker r r ch r sg with respect to s consists of the elements which have no nodes from sg we may therefore choose a g ker r r ch r sg so that and sg r sg finally we get that h h sg g which implies k is the class of a differential of something in r 5 we will now show that the homology of ker consists of differentials of elements of the kernel of the map r r there is a basis for ker given by applying id to each basis tree in ch r sg if we look at the span of these basis trees mapped into lu r g g which must homologously give the suspension of ker we get ker p vect id r lur sg g lu r g g this is isomorphic as a graded vector space to ker p r g sg r but with the differential given by g r s where g differentiates the g sg part with the chainification differential r goes from the g sg r part to the g sg part and is given by differentiating only the nodes from r with the chainification differential and then projecting to g sg lastly s is on the g sg r part and differentiates the nodes not from r with the chainification differential there is an inclusion u of ker p into this chain complex with chain cokernel lu r g g we see that any h ker p with h 0 will be in r and have guh 0 and h can be expressed as sh then rsh uh and ssh 0 finally this allows us to conclude from the homology long exact sequence that is injective in homology which means the nontrivial homology classes in ker are the elements that map to nontrivial homology classes in r ch r sg we reach the desired conclusion by identifying ker with the r parts of the cyclic elements of ker p r g sg r with the differential we defined earlier finally we have what we need for the homology long exact sequences of the diagram to give the isomorphism h lugo r one will find that any element of r that is not a composition of elements in the minimal generating module for the ideal will go to zero in r this means that r is generated by the minimal relations for o with respect to the generating module g it is fairly easy to explicitly carry out the con struction of r for simple operads doing so yields the following homologies of universal linking operads example 3 1 h luass is the free operad generated by a degree 1 arity 3 element and that element is the class given by s 1 s 1 example 3 2 h lug comm lie with arity equal to one more than the degree where g is the free module on one arity two generator example 3 3 h lu lie is free on a single degree one arity three generator which is invariant under cyclic permutations but not odd permutations conjecture 3 1 h lu comm ass is free on a degree one arity three gen erator for which the jacobi identity holds we suspect this due to the following cokernel sequence lu lie 0 lu ass lu comm ass 6 3 2 chain complex algebras definition 3 1 an operad o is integral if for all a o and all b o if a 1 b 0 then a 0 or b 0 the reader should note that virtually all notable operads in vectk are both integral and quadratic for instance the associative operad ass the operad for lie algebras lie pre lie algebras prelie and the operad of commutative algebras comm theorem 3 1 let o be an integral operad which is concentrated in degree zero and generated by g suppose that c is a chain complex which has an algebra structure over o which acts trivially on h c then h c has a potentially nontrivial algebra structure over h lug o which is unique if h 1 end c vanishes in arity equal to that of g proof c has an algebra structure over an operad concentrated in degree zero o given by the structural morphism n o n homchain c n c and we have inclusions n homchain c n c homvect c n c the codomains of which form a chain complex operad denoted end c with differential given by commutation with the differentials of its domain and codomain since o acs trivially on h c we know that the image of o in end c is in the image of the differential so if g denotes the inclusion of gen o into o we can choose a lifting of g up therefore we have a map luo end c given by the universal property and since the cycles are the chain morphisms and the boundaries are the maps that are trivial on homol ogy we see that this induces maps n h lugo n hom h c n h c this is therefore a h luo operad algebra structure on h c the lifting of g will be unique up to homotopy if h 1 end c vanishes and a change in lifting of g due to integrality will induce the same maps n and therefore the same algebra structure on h c this yields the uniqueness result example 3 4 consider a topological semigroup a with h n a k 6 0 only if n 1 mod 3 then there is a trinary operation on the homology of the semigroup given by theorem 3 1 which is nontrivial in some cases proof it is clear that any homology chain complex in this situation sat isfies the conditions of theorem 3 1 for the operad of associative algebras and from example 1 we see this yields a trinary operation on the homol ogy it remains to construct a nontrivial example consider the pointed cw complex given by a s 1 d 3 s 4 and the pointed topological semigroup structure given by a homeomorphism s 1 s 1 d 3 and homeomorphisms s 1 d 3 s 4 and d 3 s 1 s 4 where s 4 and s 4 are two hemispheres of s 4 all other smash products are taken to the base point on the cellular 7 homology chain complex this induces an ass algebra structure which acts trivially on the homology and therefore yields h 1 a k 3 h 4 a k which we can compute as follows using the notation that square brackets de note homology class and angle brackets denote the chain complex generator from the cell s 1 s 1 s 1 s s 1 s 1 s 1 s 1 s 1 s 1 s d 3 s 1 s 1 d 3 d 3 s 1 s 1 d 3 s 4 s 4 s 4 therefore is nontrivial and we have constructed an explicit geometric example of when the construction from theorem 3 1 is nontrivial example 3 5 consider a topological space a for which h n a k 6 0 only if n 1 mod 3 then there is a triple product h k a k h m a k h n a k h k m n 1 a k given by theorem 3 1 applied to the cup product on the suspension of a proof easy consequence of theorem 3 1 one should note that in the characteristic zero case this operation is always trivial due to the properties of the cup product on the suspension however we have yet to determine if there are nontrivial examples in the characteristic 2 case if c is a chain complex with h 1 end c 0 and an operad alge bra structure for the integral operad o with structural map o hom c n c then this induces an o structure on h c with struc tural map denoted by h o end h c by theorem 3 1 there is a h lu ker h algebra structure on h c this gives a way of gaining additional information from any operad algebra structure on a siutable chain complex 4 higher linking operads so far we have only considered the case of universal linking operads where is an inclusion of a generating module however there are many interesting situations in which this is not the case for instance we can construct a universal linking operad lu sr g for any pair of free operads with a morphism r g for the standard presentation of the associative operad ass let us consider the homology of lu basis elements of this operad are linear combinations and permutations of trees which have nodes of arity two or three and with degree equal to the number 8 of arity three nodes this can be embedded in the cellular complex of the associahedra and we can think of this operad geometrically in this way we see that h lu is the homology of the subset of the associahedra the a operad which includes only the cubic cells in that case the homology is generated by the pentagonal cells and points in the associahedra from this we see that the homology of this universal linking operad is very nontrivial indeed as it is not even finitely generated from this geometric interpretation we see that when we apply theorem 3 1 to this universal linking operad we get the first obstruction to a given nonassociative product extending to an a structure wth a given choice of associator because if any of the pentagons cannot be filled in then there is no chance of filling in the entirity of the a operad it becomes clear from looking at this associahedron example that it may be natural to link on more operads to this universal linking operad in order to get the higher cells in our complex to do this we would want to universally link the pentagon to lu by taking lu lu where is the pentagon cell to repeat this process it will be convenient to define a functor link o 1 o 2 on recursively as link o 1 o 2 on 1 lu on 1 link o 1 o 2 on which assumes specified morphisms from the desuspension of each operad s generating module to the previous link operad we write link o 1 o 2 to mean the colimit of the finite links example 4 1 there is an isomorphism a link 1 2 3 where each i is the boundary of the i dimensional associahedron in terms of the other associahedra and is the point proof the right hand side has basis given by arbitrary trees with permu tation which gives an isomorphism to a see 3 2 the differentials are equal by construction let us discuss the process involved in this example in more depth each time we add another operad to the link we are killing all of the nontriv ial homology classes of the universal linking operad that we already have this happens because the ideal generated by the new relation includes all of the nontrivial homology classes of the current link operad new homology classes arise in the cokernel which are killed in the next link each time we kill homology the nontrivial part of the homology vanishes entirely in one higher arity therefore after killing homology forever we reach an operad which is acyclic except for the point classes that were never killed origi nally therefore the colimit is a chain complex operad which has homology equivalent to the original operad we will now generalize the example 9 proposition 4 1 let o be an operad and let g r be its presentation then define modules recursively as follows r 0 r and rn 1 ker fn dn where fn h link g sr 0 sr 1 sr 2 srn o sets each ri to zero and where dn is the smallest arity in which ker fn dn is nontrivial the defining morphisms for the link operad can be any maps that take the homology classes to their representations then link g sr 0 sr 1 sr 2 is a quasi free resolution of o proof we see this operad is quasi free because it is a link of free operads to see that it is equvalent to o observe that the homology classes in the kernel of the map to o are trivialized by construction in one higher arity for each step in the colimit the equivalence for the resolution is colimnfn proposition 4 2 any operad of the form link m 0 m 1 m 2 is a minimal operad if for all i j we have max arity mi min arity mj proof the decomposability of the differential follows from the increasing arity condition and the diferential of mn 1 is in ni 0 mi by definition theorem 4 1 if g r is a minimal presentation for o then the resolution given by proposition 4 1 is the minimal model proof from the proof of proposition 4 2 we see that the conditions for minimality hold for ri with i 1 the only possible issue is that the differentials of sr 1 and sr 0 might not be decomposable for an arbitrary presentation we see that if g is the minimal generating module then the differential of sr 0 is decomposable any homology class built from the elements of r 0 and g with a nontrivial tree basis component r will yield via the basis components that cancel with in the differential an expression for the relation in the ideal generated by the other relations in r as we assume that the relations we chose are minimal such a homology class can not exist therefore the derivative of sr 1 is decomposable as well this gives minimality minimal models are defined in 5 and 4 and are unique up to isomor phism proposition 4 3 all quasi free chain complex operads f are equivalent to some link of free operads proof take gen f and split it into g 0 g 1 by degree then the operad given by link g 1 g 2 will be isomorphic to f as vector space operads because they are both free on the same generators the chain maps are the same by construction because we can choose the differentials to be anything that maps to lower degree 10 references 1 i moerdijk c berger axiomatic homotopy theory for operads com ment math helv 78 4 2003 2 a tonks f muro unital associahedra forum mathematicum 26 2
