index we developed a version of quillen s geometric cobordism theory for infinite dimensional hilbert manifolds this cobordism theory has a graded group structure under topological union operation and has push forward maps for complex orientable fredholm maps in 19 by using quinn s transversality theorem 23 it has been shown that this cobordism theory has a graded ring structure under transversal intersection operation and has pull back maps for smooth maps it has been shown that the thom isomorphism in this theory was satisfied for finite dimensional vector bundles over separable hilbert manifolds and the projection formula for gysin maps has been proved in 3 chas and sullivan described an intersection product on the homology of loop space lm in 4 r cohen and j jones described a realization of the chas sullivan loop product in terms of a ring spectrum structure on the thom spectrum of a certain virtual bundle over the loop space in this paper we will extend this product on cobordism and bordism theories 1 the fredholm index and complex cobordism of hilbert manifolds in 22 quillen gave a geometric interpretation of cobordism groups which suggests a way of defining the cobordism of separable hilbert manifolds equipped with suitable structure in order that such a definition be sensible it ought to reduce to his for finite dimensional manifolds and smooth maps of manifolds and be capable of supporting reasonable calculations for important types of infinite dimensional manifolds such as homogeneous spaces of free loop groups of finite dimensional lie groups 1 1 cobordism of separable hilbert manifolds by a manifold we mean a smooth manifold mod elled on a separable hilbert space see lang 13 for details on infinite dimensional manifolds the facts about fredholm map can be found in 5 definition 1 1 suppose that f x y is a proper fredholm map with even index at each point then f is an admissible complex orientable map if there is a smooth factorization f x f q y where q y is a finite dimensional smooth complex vector bundle and f is a smooth embedding endowed with a complex structure on its normal bundle f a complex orientation for a fredholm map f of odd index is defined to be one for the map f x y r given by f x f x 0 for every x x at x x index f x index fx 1 also the finite dimensional complex vector bundle in the smooth factorization will be replaced by r suppose that f is an admissible complex orientable map then since the map f is the fredholm and is a finite dimensional vector bundle we see f is also a fredholm map by the surjectivity of q index f index f dim before we give a notion of equivalence of such factorizations f of f we want to give some definitions definition 1 2 let x y be the smooth separable hilbert manifolds and f x r y a smooth map then we will say that f is an isotopy if it satisfies the following conditions 1 for every t r the map ft given by ft x f x t is an embedding 2 there exist numbers t 0 t 1 such that ft ft 0 for all t 6 t 0 and ft ft 1 for all t t 1 the closed interval t 0 t 1 is called a proper domain for the isotopy we say that two embeddings f x y and g x y are isotopic if there exists an isotopy ft x r y with proper domain t 0 t 1 such that f ft 0 and g ft 1 date september 02 2003 1991 mathematics subject classification algebraic topology global analysis key words and phrases cobordism fredholm map hilbert manifold loop space pontjagin thom construction chas sullivan loop product 1 http arxiv org abs math 0412476 v 1 proposition 1 3 see 13 the relation of isotopy between smooth embeddings is an equivalence rela tion definition 1 4 two factorizations f x f q y and f x f q y are equivalent if and can be embedded as subvector bundles of a vector bundle y such that f and f are isotopic in and this isotopy is compatible with the complex structure on the normal bundle that is there is an isotopy f such that for all t t 0 t 1 ft x is endowed with a complex structure on its normal bundle which matches that of f and f in at t 0 and t 1 respectively by proposition 1 3 we have proposition 1 5 the relation of equivalence of admissible complex orientability of proper fredholm maps between separable hilbert manifolds is an equivalence relation this generalizes quillen s notion of complex orientability for maps of finite dimensional manifolds we can also define a notion of cobordism of admissible complex orientable maps between separable hilbert manifolds first we recall some ideas on the transversality definition 1 6 let f 1 m 1 n f 2 m 2 n be smooth maps between hilbert manifolds then f 1 and f 2 are transverse at y n if df 1 tx 1 m 1 df 2 tx 2 m 2 tyn whenever f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 y the maps f 1 and f 2 are said to be transverse if they are transverse at every point of n lemma 1 7 smooth maps fi mi n i 1 2 are transverse if and only if f 1 f 2 m 1 m 2 n n is transverse to the diagonal map n n n definition 1 8 let f 1 m 1 n f 2 m 2 n be transverse smooth maps between smooth hilbert manifolds the topological pullback m 1 n m 2 x 1 x 2 m 1 m 2 f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 is a submanifold of m 1 m 2 and the diagram m 1 n m 2 f 2 f 1 m 2 y f 1 f 2 y f 2 m 1 f 1 n is commutative where the map fi fj is pull back of fj by fi definition 1 9 let fi xi y i 0 1 be admissible complex oriented maps then f 0 is cobordant to f 1 if there is an admissible complex orientable map h w y r such that the maps i y y r given by i y y i for i 0 1 are transverse to h and the pull back map i h is equivalent to fi the cobordism class of f x y will be denoted by x f proposition 1 10 if f x y is an admissible complex orientable map and g z y a smooth map transverse to f then the pull back map g f z y x z is an admissible complex orientable map with finite dimensional pull back vector bundle g z y z v z g z q v in the factorization of g f where q y is the finite dimensional complex vector bundle in the factorization of f as in definition 1 1 the next result was proved in 17 by essentially the same argument as in the finite dimensional situation using the implicit function theorem 13 theorem 1 11 cobordism is an equivalence relation definition 1 12 for a separable hilbert manifold y ud y is the set of cobordism classes of the admissible complex orientable proper fredholm maps of index d 2 my next result is the following theorem 1 13 if f x y is an admissible complex orientable fredholm map of index d 1 and g y z is an admissible complex orientable fredholm map of index d 2 then g f x z is an admissible complex orientable fredholm map with index d 1 d 2 let g y z be an admissible complex orientable fredholm map of index r by theorem 1 13 we have push forward or gysin map g u d y ud r z given by g x f x g f we show in 17 that it is well defined if g y z is a second map cobordant to g then g g in particular if g and g are homotopic through proper fredholm maps they induce the same gysin maps clearly we have h g h g for admissible complex orientable fredholm maps h g and id id the graded cobordism set u y of the separable hilbert manifold y has a group structure given as follows let x 1 f 1 and x 2 f 2 be cobordism classes then x 1 f 1 x 2 f 2 is the class of the map f 1 f 2 x 1 x 2 y where x 1 x 2 is the topological sum disjoint union of x 1 and x 2 we show in 17 that this sum is well defined as usual the class of the empty set is the zero element of the cobordism set and the negative of x f is itself with the opposite orientation on the normal bundle of the embedding f then we have theorem 1 14 the graded cobordism set u y of the admissible complex orientable maps of y is a graded abelian group now we define relative cobordism definition 1 15 if a is a finite dimensional submanifold of y the relative cobordism set u y a is the set of the admissible complex orientable maps of y whose images lie in y a more generally theorem 1 16 let a be a finite dimensional submanifold of y then the relative cobordism set u y a is a graded abelian group and there is a homomorphism u y a u y by m h y m h y with h m y a if our cobordism functor u of admissible complex orientable fredholm maps is restricted to finite dimensional hilbert manifolds it agrees quillen s complex cobordism functor mu theorem 1 17 for finite dimensional separable hilbert manifolds a y there is a natural isomor phism u y a mu y a 1 2 transversal approximations contravariance and cup products we would like to define a product structure on the graded cobordism group u y given cobordism classes x 1 f 1 u d 1 y 1 and x 2 f 2 u d 2 y 2 their external product is x 1 f 1 x 2 f 2 x 1 x 2 f 1 f 2 u d 1 d 2 y 1 y 2 although there is the external product in the category of cobordism of separable hilbert manifolds we can not necessarily define an internal product on u y unless y is a finite dimensional manifold however if admissible complex orientable fredholm map f 1 f 2 x 1 x 2 y y is transverse to the diagonal imbedding y y y then we do have an internal cup product x 1 f 1 x 2 f 2 x 1 x 2 f 1 f 2 if y is finite dimensional then by haefliger and thom s transversality theorem in 25 every complex orientable map to y has a transverse approximation hence the cup product induces a graded ring structure on u y the unit element 1 is represented by the identity map y y with index 0 however f quinn 23 proved the generalization of thom s transversality theorem for separable hilbert manifolds using smooth transversal approximations of sard functions in fine topology by quinn s transversality theorem a smooth map even continuous map g z y can be deformed to a smooth map g z y by a small correction until it is transverse to an admissible complex orientable map f x y it is obvious that they are homotopic each other by definition of cobordism and proposition 1 10 the cobordism functor is contravariant for any smooth map between separable hilbert manifolds 3 theorem 1 18 let f x y be an admissible complex oriented map and let g z y be a smooth may be continuous map then the cobordism class of the pull back z y x z depends only on the cobordism class of f hence there is a map g ud y ud z given by g x f g x f z y x g f where g is a smooth approximation of g which is transverse to f moreover g depends only on the homotopy class of g let turn back the interior cup products in u given cobordism classes x 1 f 1 u d 1 y 1 and x 2 f 2 u d 2 y 2 their external product is x 1 f 1 x 2 f 2 x 1 x 2 f 1 f 2 u d 1 d 2 y 1 y 2 if admissible complex orientable fredholm map f 1 f 2 is transverse to the diagonal imbedding y y y then we do have an internal cup product x 1 f 1 x 2 f 2 x 1 x 2 f 1 f 2 if the diagonal imbedding y y y is not transverse to smooth proper fredholm map f 1 f 2 x 1 x 2 by quinn s transversality theorem we can find a smooth approximation of which is transverse to f 1 f 2 then theorem 1 19 if x 1 f 1 u d 1 y 1 and x 2 f 2 u d 2 y 2 internal cup product x 1 f 1 x 2 f 2 x 1 x 2 f 1 f 2 x 1 x 2 f 1 f 2 u d 1 d 2 y where is a smooth approximation of which is transverse to f 1 f 2 the cup product is well defined and associative then u is a multiplicative contravariant functor for smooth functions on the separable hilbert manifolds we define the euler class of a finite dimensional complex vector bundle on a separable hilbert manifold note that theorem 1 18 implies that this euler class is a well defined invariant of the bundle definition 1 20 let b be a finite dimensional complex vector bundle of dimension d on a separable hilbert manifold b with zero section i b the u theory euler class of is the element i i 1 u 2 d b let x be a finite dimensional complex vector bundle of dimension d on a separable hilbert manifold x with zero section i x now we need a useful lemma from 23 lemma 1 21 a smooth split submanifold of a smooth separable hilbert manifold has a smooth tubular neighborhood the map i is proper so that we have the gysin map i u j x uj 2 d u where u is a smooth neighborhood of the zero section the map is not proper however if u is contained in a tube u r of finite radius r then u is proper and we can define u j 2 d u uj x since i id we have i id the composite map i is homotopic to id if u u is itself a tube the homotopy moves on u and we have thom isomorphism uj 2 d u u j x 4 2 the ring structure on lm tm and the chas sullivan loop product in u lm let md be a closed oriented d dimensional smooth manifold and let lm c s 1 m be the space of smooth loops in m in 3 chas and sullivan described an intersection product on the homology h lm having total degree d hq lm hr lm hq r d lm in 4 r cohen and j jones described a realization of the chas sullivan loop product in terms of a ring spectrum structure on the thom spectrum of a certain virtual bundle over the loop space we want to extend this product on the u theory let md be a closed complex d dimensional smooth manifold and let lm c s 1 m be the space of smooth loops in m let consider the standard parameterization of the circle by the unit interval exp 0 1 s 1 defined by exp t e 2 it with respect to this parameterization we can regard a loop lm as a map 0 1 m with 0 1 let consider the evaluation map ev lm m by 1 let m cn d be a fixed smooth imbedding of m into codimension n unitary space let n m be the 2 n dimensional normal bundle let th n be the thom space of this bundle we know that th n is spanier whitehead dual to m where m denotes m with a disjoint basepoint let m tm be the spectrum given by desuspending the thom space m tm 2 n d th n we have the following spectra maps s 0 m m tm and m m tm s 0 where m tm is s dual of m these maps induce an equivalence with the function spectrum m tm map m s 0 since u x mu x for finite dimensional manifolds x and the contravariant cobor dism theory mu is dual to the covariant bordism theory mu we have the following isomorphisms u q m u q m tm u q m tm uq m for all q z these duality isomorphisms are induced by the compositions u q m tm u q 2 d m uq m where is the thom isomorphism and is the poincar e duality isomorphism for compact manifolds by duality the diagonal map m m m induces a map of spectra m tm m tm m tm that makes m tm into a ring spectrum with unit s 0 m tm let th ev n be the thom space of the pull back bundle ev n lm where lm c s 1 m is smooth manifold over separable hilbert space h let define the spectrum lm tm 2 n d th ev n the representing dual manifold x of the spectrum lm tm is also a smooth separable hilbert man ifold e g lm tm x f u 2 d lm now we will give the main theorem of this work theorem 2 1 the spectrum lm tm is a homotopy commutative ring spectrum with unit whose mul tiplication lm tm lm tm lm tm satisfies the following properties 1 the evaluation map ev lm tm m tm is a map of ring spectra 2 there is a map of ring spectra lm tm m where the target is the suspension spectrum of the based loop space with a disjoint basepoint its ring structure is induced by the usual product on the based loop space in bordism the map is given by the composition muq lm tm muq 2 d lm muq m 5 where is the thom isomorphism and takes a bordism class with dimension q 2 d and by intersecting with the based loop m as a codimension 2 d e g i mu lm mu 2 d m is an induced homomorphism from the embedding i m lm 3 the ring structure is compatible with the chas sullivan loop product in the sense that the following diagrams commute u q lm tm u r lm tm ext u q r lm tm lm tm u q r lm tm y u y y u u q 2 d lm u r 2 d lm u q r 2 d lm and uq lm tm ur lm tm ext uq r lm tm lm tm uq r lm tm y u y y u uq 2 d lm ur 2 d lm uq r 2 d lm where ext is the external product u is the thom isomorphism lm tm lm tm lm tm is the diagonal map which is adjoint to the multiplication map lm tm lm tm lm tm and is the chas sullivan loop product in cobordism proof the proof was done in 4 by essentially the same argument for homology but their proof had a fundamental mistake in this proof we will sort out this mistake and we will do the modification for cobordism and bordism theories let m m m be the diagonal embedding of closed oriented manifold m the normal bundle is isomorphic to the tangent bundle tm so that the pontrjagin thom map is a complex orientable map m m mtm with index zero so we have gysin map in cobordism mu m m mu mtm u mu 2 d m which is the transversal intersection product here we will apply the pontrjagin thom construction to the diagonal embedding m m m using the canonical bundle tm tm over m m we get a map of thom spectra m m tm tm mtm tm tm or m tm m tm m tm the details about the pontrjagin thom construction can be found in 4 to construct the ring spectrum product lm tm lm tm lm tm they pull back the structure over the loop space lm for this they define lm m lm which is fiber product in the following diagram lm m lm lm lm ev y y ev ev m m m they note that lm m lm is a codimension 2 d submanifold of the infinite dimensional manifold lm lm and it is equal to lm lm 0 0 since ev lm m is a submersion the fiber product corresponds to transversal intersection of maps so is pull back of the diagonal map under the submersion map ev ev lm lm m m the induced map is a fredholm map with index 2 d and consequently lm m lm is a codimension 2 d smooth submanifold of the infinite dimensional manifold lm lm 6 also they note that there is a natural map lm m lm lm defined by first applying and then that is lm m lm lm by where t 2 t if 0 t 1 2 2 t 1 if 1 2 t 1 but the image of is not smooth loop as they have described it above however there is a standard way to modify the definition of so that the target is smooth the resolution is in the parametrization of the loop with continuous loops one just defines t 2 t if 0 t 1 2 2 t 1 if 1 2 t 1 but this may be not be smooth at 1 2 or at 1 to modify this we need a bijective smooth function from 0 1 to 0 1 which has all derivatives zero at 0 and 1 since we will use this to reparameterize the two loops then we can patch them together without losing smoothness to write this special parametrization we define a map 0 1 0 1 by t 1 c t 0 exp 1 s 2 s 1 2 ds where c 1 0 exp 1 s 2 s 1 2 ds it is a smooth bijective function from 0 1 to 0 1 which has all derivatives zero at 0 and 1 now we can define a map lm lm by t t t it is a smooth map and let lresm lm lresm is a smooth submanifold of lm and it is smooth homotopic retraction of lm similarly lresm mlresm can be constructed it is also smooth homotopic retraction of lm m lm then we can define a new version of the map lm m lm lm as the composition of the following maps lm m lm lresm m lresm lresm lm the defined new version of is smooth in the proof of 4 we can use lresm m lresm instead of lm m lm because it is smooth homotopic retraction of lm lm if we restrict to the product of the based loop spaces resm resm lresm m lresm then is just the h space product on the based loop space resm resm resm the embedding lresm m lresm lresm lresm has a tubular neighborhood defined to be the inverse image of the tubular neighborhood of the diagonal map m m m ev 1 hence there is a pontjagin thom construction lresm lresm lresm m lresm ev tm the map is a smooth fredholm map by the pontrjagin thom construction we have the following commutative diagram lresm lresm lresm m lresm tm ev y y ev m m mtm in bordism we have u lres lresm u 2 d lres m lresm where takes a bordism class with dimension n and intersects with the submanifold lres m lresm as a codimension 2 d i e pull backs by the inclusion lres m lresm lres lresm by the following commutative diagram lresm m lresm lresm ev y y ev m m 7 we have an induced map of bundles ev tm ev tm hence we have a map of spectra lresm m lresm tm lresm tm then we will get the following composition lresm lresm lresm m lresm tm lmtm in bordism the homomorphism u lm lm u lm tm u u 2 d lm takes a bordism class in lm lm intersects in with the codimension d submanifold lresm m lresm maps it via to lm this is the definition of chas sullivan product u lm using the diagonal embedding lm lm lm we can perform the pontrjagin thom construction when we pull back the virtual bundle tm tm over lm lm then we obtain lm tm lm tm lresm m lresm tm 2 tm lresm m lresm tm then we can define the ring structure on the thom spectrum to be the composition lm tm lm tm lresm m lresm tm lm tm in 4 they show that is associative in bordism by thom isomorphism induces the same homomorphism as so we have the following diagram commutes uq 4 d lm tm lm tm uq 4 d lm tm u y u y uq lm lm uq 2 d lm where uq lm lm uq 2 d lm is the chas sullivan product in complex cobordism we define the chas sullivan product by the following commutative diagram u q 4 d lm tm lm tm u q 4 d lm tm u y u y u q lm lm u q 2 d lm in 4 they show that lm tm m is a map of ring spectra in bordism the map is given by the composition muq lm tm muq 2 d lm muq m where is the thom isomorphism and takes a bordism class with dimension q 2 d and by intersecting with the based loop m as a codimension 2 d e g i mu lm mu 2 d m is an induced homomorphism from the embedding i m lm references 1 a j baker c ozel complex cobordism of hilbert manifolds
