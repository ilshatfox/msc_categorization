for r a commutative ring and particularly in the functor from such a module m to the module of d fold invariant tensors m d d this module of invari ant tensors is canonically isomorphic to the degree d components dr m of the divided power algebra r m though these are non additive functors of m whenever d 1 they may be derived by the dold puppe theory 12 this associates to m a family of ith derived functors li d m n which depends on an additional positive integer n in a wider perspective li d r m n is the ith homotopy group of quillen s left derived object l dr m n where m n is the module m viewed as a chain complex concentrated in de gree n 29 when r is a field the functors li d r m n are known our aim is to compute certain of its values when r z such computations are motivated by applications in both algebraic topology and in representation theory in algebraic topology the functors li d z a n where a is an arbitrary abelian group are closely related to the integral homology of the eilenberg mac lane spaces k a n 2 i e those spaces whose only non trivial homotopy group is a in degree n 2 indeed even though a truly functorial description of the homology groups h k a n 2 z is complicated they are endowed with a natural filtration inducing functorial isomorphism d 0 l 2 d d z a n gr h k a n 2 z 1 1 on the associated graded components this filtration splits functorially when we restrict ourselves to the subcategory of free abelian groups so that there are then functorial isomorphisms d 0 l 2 d d z a n h k a n 2 z 1 2 derived functors of the divided power functors 3 for all n 0 when a non free such an isomorphism still exists but is no longer functorial in a we refer to our appendix b for a further discussion of this issue the abelian groups li d z a n are thus quite fundamental for topology and the description of their dependence on the group a carries much useful information which remains hidden when such a finitely generated group is decomposed into a direct sum of cyclic groups in representation theory the representations of integral schur algebras can be described in terms of the strict polynomial functors of friedlander and suslin such strict polynomial functors can be thought of as functors from finitely generated free abelian groups to abelian groups equipped with an additional strict polynomial structure the derived category of weight d homogeneous strict polynomial functorsd pd z is equipped with a ringel duality operator which is a self equivalence of d pd z for a free finitely generated there is an isomorphism h n dz a lnd d z a n such an isomorphism holds for all strict polynomial functors but the case of divided powers is fundamental since these functors constitute a family of projective generators of the category in this context the description of the l d z a n as functors of a is essential since the functoriality is necessary in order to determine the action of the schur algebra hence to obtain the expressions h n d z a as representations and not simply as abelian groups actually we need more than the functoriality in order to understand the action of the schur algebra we really need to describe the strict polynomial structure of these functors let us briefly review what was known previously on the derived functors l d z a n the integral homology of eilenberg mac lane spaces was computed by h cartan a non functorial description of these homology groups is given in 10 exp 11 thm 1 and a functorial one in 10 exp 11 thm 5 work in this direction was pursued by two students of mac lane hamsher 17 and decker 11 who studied the cases n 1 and n 1 respectively by the isomorphism 1 1 it is possible to retrieve from these results a description of the derived functors l d z a n the answers however are very complicated for example the homology groups hi k a n z for a finitely generated abelian group a are described functorially by an infinite list of generators and relations even though they are of finite type some additional progress in computing the functors l d z a n was made by a direct study of its properties by bousfield in 6 7 and a complete description of these functors for any a was obtained for d 2 by baues and pirashvili 3 and in 9 for d 3 on the other hand no description of the strict polynomial structure of the functors l d z a n has been given so far we now list the results which we obtain in this paper we give full description as strict polynomial functors 1 of the l d z a 1 for all d and a free by 1 2 this determines a new and functorial description of the groups h k a 3 z for a a free abelian group 2 of the l d z a n for d 4 and a free our treatment is elementary and self contained and does not use computations from the literature the strict polynomial structures come in as a help in the computations our computations have a number of interesting byproducts in particular 3 short proofs of some computations first obtained in 35 including that of l d k v n where k is a field of characteristic 2 derived functors of the divided power functors 4 4 a new family of exact complexes of koszul type involving divided powers over a field of characteristic 2 the kernels of these new complexes yield new families of functors related to the 2 primary component of l d z a 1 we describe these functors in a variety of ways the simplest is the 2 primary component of l 3 4 a 1 which we denote by 4 a and which can be described as the cokernel of the natural transformation 4 f 2 a 2 4 f 2 a 2 determined by the algebra structure of f 2 a 2 such a map only exists in characteristic 2 5 we give a description of the groups hn i k a n z for a free in the range 0 i 10 which is both more natural and more precise than cartan s in 10 finally in section 11 we return to the derived functors l d z a n for all n d and all abelian groups a we present a conjectural description of these functors up to a filtration in terms of simpler derived functors of divided and exterior powers we then make use here of our results and of those from 9 in order to provide some evidence in support of this conjecture we will now discuss the content of this article in more detail in sections 2 and 3 we collect the main properties of divided power algebras strict polynomial functors and derived functors which will be required in section 4 we introduce the useful notion of a quasi trivial filtration which will allow us to prove that certain spectral sequences degenerate for v a vector space over a characteristic p field k the divided power algebra k v possesses such a filtration which we call the principal filtration we use this filtration to compute in section 5 those values of the derived functors li d k v n which will be needed in the sequel in sections 6 and 7 we compute the strict polynomial functors li d z a 1 for any free abelian group a with the help of the bockstein maps these may be viewed as a family of differentials on the mod p graded groups l d fp a p 1 and can be explicitly described while in odd characteristic these mod p derived functors together the bockstein differen tials simply provide us with a standard dual koszul complex the result is slightly different in characteristic 2 in that case the bockstein differentials determine on l d f 2 a 2 1 a sort of dual koszul complex structure in which the differentials are twisted by a frobenius map we call this characteristic 2 complex the skew koszul complex in both odd and even characteristic the integral homology groups l d z a p 1 are simply the groups of cycles in these koszul and twisted koszul complexes and we are able to analyze these more precisely in a number of situations in section 8 to 10 we present another method for computing the derived functors of d z a here we use the adic filtration associated to the augmentation ideal of the algebra z a we call this filtration the maximal filtration on z a it was the filtration chosen in 9 in order to study the derived functors of 3 z a with the help of the associated spectral sequence we determine the values of l 4 z a n the easiest cases n 1 2 are studied in section 9 where we pay particular attention to the first new functor occurring among the derived functors of 4 z a this is the functor 4 a mentioned above the 2 primary component of l 3 4 z a 1 which we describe in three distinct ways as n in creases the situation becomes more involved and a detailed study of the differentials in the maximal filtration spectral sequence for 4 z a n for a general n is carried out in section 10 the computation of certain differentials is delicate and involves functorial consid erations and careful dimension counts this yields an inductive formula for l 4 z a n theorem 10 2 from which the complete description of the derived functors of 4 z a n for all n follows directly theorem 10 1 derived functors of the divided power functors 5 in section 11 we return to the derived functors l d z a n for all n d and all abelian groups a we propose a conjectural description up to a filtration of the functors lr d z a n to state this requires that we first discuss the stable homology groups hr k a n z i e those for which n r 2 n these additive groups are discussed in a number of sources and we first review here for the reader s convenience certain aspects of the admissible words formalism of cartan we then reformulate in theorem 11 3 his admissible words in terms of a simpler labelling which only involves those words which do not involve the transpotence operation we refer in proposition 11 4 to cartan s compu tation of these stable values and this is the only place in the text where we make use for simplicity of his results we then state our conjecture 11 5 and we verify that it is compatible with theorems 6 3 and 10 1 as well as with the results in 9 we view the appendices as an integral part of our text in appendix a we review some classical methods of computations of hom s and ext 1 s in functor categories which are used many times in our arguments appendix b begins with a discussion of the relation between the derived functors of the functor d z a and the integral homology of k a n we then display a complete table of the functorial values of the groups hn i k a n z for a free in the range 0 i 10 while the constraints in choosing this range of values of i were to some extent typographical the fact that we only know the complete set of derived functors of d z a for d 4 would have precluded the display of a complete table for much higher values of i this table already features most of the unexpected phenomena which we encounter in our computations as will be seen from the discussion which precedes the table a final appendix provides for convenience a complete list

symmetric algebra sr m and the exterior algebra r m are well known the divided power algebra r m deserves equal attention we recall here its basic properties refering to 31 for the proofs the algebra r m is defined as the commutative r algebra generated for all x m and all non negative integers i by elements i x which satisfy the following relations for all x y m and r 1 0 x 1 x 6 0 2 1 2 s x t x s t s s t x 2 2 3 n x y s t n s x t y n 1 2 3 4 n x n n x n 1 2 4 setting s t 1 in 2 2 one finds by induction on n that xn n n x which justifies the name of divided power algebra for r m the definition r m is functorial with respect to m an r linear map f m n induces a morphism of r algebras r m r n which sends i x to i f x the relations 2 1 2 4 are homogeneous so that r m can be given a graded algebra structure by setting deg i x i we denote by d r m the homogeneous component of degree d so that we have functorial r linear isomorphisms 0 r m r and 1 r m m and a functorial decomposition r m d 0 dr m consider the graded commutative algebra tm d 0 v d equipped with the shuffle product and let us denote by ts m the graded subalgebra of invariant tensors ts m d 0 v d d there is a well defined functorial homomorphism of graded algebras r m ts m 2 5 which sends n x to x n the morphism 2 5 is an isomorphism if m is projective 31 prop iv 5 in particular for a projective r module m we have functorial isomorphisms dr m m d d this description of d m by invariant tensors is no longer valid for arbitrary modulesm for example it follows by inspection from the relations 2 1 2 4 above that 2 z z 2 z 4 2 6 so that this group cannot live in z 2 z 2 this example also shows that divided power algebras behave differently from symmetric and exterior algebras with respect to torsion indeed sz m and sfp m coincide for any fp modulem as do z m and fp m but the similar assertion is not true for z m and fp m in particular for any fp module m we will always carefully distinguish between the functors z m and fp m 2 2 exponential functors a functor f m from r modules to r algebras is said to be an exponential functor if for all pair of r modules m and n the composite f m f n f i 1 f i 2 f m n f m n mult f m n 2 7 derived functors of the divided power functors 7 induced by the canonical inclusions i 1 i 2 of m and n into m n is an isomorphism we refer to the map 2 7 as the exponential isomorphism for f m for example the algebras sr m r m and r m 31 thm iii 4 determine exponential functors exponential functors are endowed with a canonical bialgebra structure indeed there is a coproduct induced by the diagonal inclusion of m into m m f m f f m m f m f m it follows from 2 3 that the coalgebra structure obtained in this way on r m is the one determined by the comultiplication map i x 7 i j k j x k x 2 3 duality given a r module m we let m homr m r the dual r m of the divided power algebra is the r module r m d 0 dr m the bialgebra structure on r m defines a bialgebra structure on r m the dual of symmetric and exterior algebras are defined similarly an explicit computation shows that for all projective r modules m there are a natural isomorphisms of r bialgebras r m sr m sr m r m r m r m 2 4 base change for any r module m and any commutative r algebra a there is a base change isomorphism of a algebras 31 thm iii 3 which sends n x 1 to n x 1 r m r a a m r a 2 8 there are similar base change isomorphisms for symmetric and exterior algebras sa m r a sa m r a r m r a a m r a 3 derived functors and strict polynomial functors 3 1 derived functors let r be a commutative ring the dold kan correspondence states that the normalized chain complex functor n is an equivalence of categories pre serving homotopy equivalences with inverse k also preserving homotopy equivalences n simpl r mod ch 0 r mod k if m is a r module and f m denotes an endofunctor of the category of r modules dold and puppe defined 12 its derived functor lif m n by the formula lif m n ifk p m n where pm is a projective resolution of m and n is the degree n shift of complexes i e c n i ci n more generally if c is a complex of r modules we denote by lf c the simplicial r module f k p where p is a complex of projective r modules quasi isomorphic to c and by lif c its homotopy groups remark 3 1 the definition of the derived functors of f only depends on the restriction of f to the category of free r modules furthermore if f commutes with directed colimits of free r modules as the divided power functors do then f is completely determined by its restriction to the category of free finitely generated r modules for example for a free r module m we have an isomorphism l d m n limi l d mi n where the limit is taken over the directed system of free finitely generated submodules mi of m derived functors of the divided power functors 8 3 2 strict polynomial functors we are mainly interested in the divided powers func tors dr m and functors related to these all these functors actually belong to a class of very rigid functors called strict polynomial functors introduced by bousfield 6 in the context of derived functors bousfield called them homogeneous functors and indepen dently by friedlander and suslin 16 in the context of the cohomology of affine algebraic group schemes we also recommend 20 for a presentation of strict polynomial functors we will only recall here the basic facts required for our computations 3 2 1 the category of strict polynomial functors strict polynomial functors can be thought of as functors from the category of finitely generated projective r modules to the cate gory of r modules equipped with an additional scheme theoretic structure morphisms of strict polynomial functors are natural transformations which preserve this additional structure the category pr of strict polynomial functors is abelian let fr denote the category of functors from finitely generated projective r modules to r modules there is an exact forgetful functor pr fr the tensor product f m r g m of two strict polynomial functors has a canonical structure of a strict polynomial functor as well as the composition f g m provided that g m has values in finitely generated projective r modules the additional scheme theoretic structure of a strict polynomial functor f m deter mines the weight of f m this weight is called degree in 16 in the present article we prefer to reserve the term degree for the homological degrees a strict polynomial functor f m of weight d is homogeneous of weight d if for all g m of weight less than d hompr g m f m is zero the full subcategory of pr whose objects are homogeneous strict polynomial functors of weight d is abelian it is usually denoted by pd r and there is an isomorphism of abelian categories pr d 0 pd r in practice the weights can be determined by the following rules the functors sdr m dr m d r m and m d are homogeneous of weight d if f m and g m are homo geneous of degree d resp e then f m g m is homogeneous of degree d e and f g m is homogeneous of degree de a useful structure on the category of strict polynomial functors is the weight preserv ing duality functor p op r pr 3 1 which sends a strict polynomial functor f m to the functor f m f m where denotes r linear duality i e m homr m r for example we have s d r m dr m and dr m dr m when r is a field the duality functor is exact the advantage of working with strict polynomial functors rather than with ordinary functors from finitely generated projective r modules to r modules is twofold 1 the category of strict polynomial functors is graded by the weight in all com putations involving strict polynomial functors this information is automatically and transparently carried by the scheme theoretic structure of the functors see remark 3 5 the price to pay is that one has be a take care that a given or dinary functor may sometimes be given several non isomorphic scheme theoretic structures as the example of the frobenius twists in section 3 2 2 shows 2 it is easier to compute extensions in pr than in fr and there are often less extensions possible in pr this fact will be of great help in solving extension problems coming from spectral sequences we have gathered in appendix a some derived functors of the divided power functors 9 standard methods and results regarding the computation of extensions in these categories an illustration of the difference between extensions in pr and in fr is provided by comparing the results from lemma a 11 with those of lemma 11 24 3 2 2 frobenius twists functors we now take a field k of positive characteristic p as our ground ring r and we let v be a generic finite dimensional k vector space we denote by v r the strict polynomial subfunctor of s pr k v generated by the pr th powers of elements of v equivalently v r is the the kernel of the map s pr k v pr 1 k 1 sk k v s pr k k v induced by the comultiplication of the symmetric power bialgebra the functor v r is called the r th frobenius twist functor it has an important role in the theory of representations of affine algebraic group schemes in positive characteristic 16 and it will also appear in our computations it enjoys the following basic properties 1 the functor v r is a homogeneous strict polynomial functor of weight pr 2 the functor v r is additive 3 the dimension of v r is equal to the dimension of v 4 the frobenius twist functors can be composed together v r s v r s and the functor v 0 is the identity functor 5 the frobenius twist functors are self dual v r v r so that v r is the cok ernel of the map pr 1 k 1 k k v pr k k v pr k v induced by the multiplication of the algebra of divided powers the inclusion v r s pr k v is called the frobenius map and the dual epimorphism pr k v v r therefore deserves to be called the verschiebung map following the usage in arithmetic as explained in appendix a these two morphisms provide bases of the vector spaces hompk v r s pr k v and hompk pr k v v r respectively observe that if k fq with q dividing p r the strict polynomial functors v nr n 0 are not isomorphic to each other since they do not have the same weight however if we forget their scheme theoretic structure and view them as ordinary functors that is as objects of fr they all become isomorphic to the identity functor 3 3 derived functors and differential graded pr algebras derivation in the sense of dold and puppe yield functors for all nonnegative integers i and n pd r pd r f m 7 lif m n we shall denote bynf m n the normalized chains of the simplicial object f k m n f k r n m thus nf m n is a complex of homogeneous strict polynomial functors of weight d remark 3 2 if k is a field of positive characteristic and g v f v r the additivity of the frobenius twist yields an isomorphismng v n nf v r n thus precomposition by frobenius twist is harmless in computations i e there are isomorphisms lig v n lif v r n by composing the shuffle map in the eilenberg zilber theorem and the product of the divided power algebra n dr m n n e r m n n d r e r m n n d e r m n we obtain an algebra structure on the direct sum n r m n d 0 n d r m n the following definition axiomatizes the properties of this direct sum as well as similar objects which will appear in our computations derived functors of the divided power functors 10 definition 3 3 let m be a projective finitely generated module over a ring r a differential graded strict polynomial algebra dg pr algebra for short is a bigraded r algebra a m d 0 i 0 a d i m endowed with a differential a d i m a d i 1 m and satisfying the following properties 1 the adi m are homogeneous strict polynomial functors of weight d with respect to m we call these the homogeneous components of degree i and weight d of a m 2 the multiplication adi m a e j m a d e i j m and the differential are mor phisms of strict polynomial functors a morphism of differential graded pr algebras f a m b m is a morphism of differential graded r algebras provided by a family of morphisms of strict polynomial functors fdi a d i m b d i m definition 3 3 admits obvious variants for dg pr coalgebras dg pr bialgebras etc whose formulation is left to the reader a dg pr algebra with zero differential is sim ply called a graded pr algebra and a graded pr algebra concentrated in degree zero is simply called a pr algebra here are some basic examples of graded pr algebras we denote by r m i the divided power algebra generated by a finitely gener ated projective r module m placed in degree i it is a graded pr algebra whose homogeneous component of degree di and weight d is dr m if r k is a field of positive characteristic p and v is a finite dimensional k vector space we similarly denote by k v r i the divided power algebra generated by a copy of the frobenius twist functor v r placed in degree i it is a graded pr algebra with d k v r as homogeneous part of degree di and weight dpr we will use the similar notations r m i k v r i sr m i and sk v r i for the corresponding exterior and symmetric algebras derivation of functors at the level of chain complexes can be restated as a functor pr algebras dg pr algebras a m 7 na m n 3 2 more generally if a m is a dg pr algebra we define na m n by placing the degree j object of the complex nadi m in weight d and degree i j with product defined by the shuffle map and the product of a m and with differential defined as the sum of the differential of a m and the differential coming from the simplicial structure we thus obtain a functor dg pr algebras dg pr algebras a m 7 na m n 3 3 remark 3 4 when a m is graded commutative and exponential the dg pr algebra na m n coincides up to homotopy equivalence with the n fold bar construction of a m 23 chap x for arbitrary dg pr algebras these two constructions are different the homology of a dg pr algebra is a graded pr algebra for example we have the graded pr algebra l r m n d 0 l d r m n 3 4 remark 3 5 the left hand side of 3 4 does not display the integer d however if we know l r m n as a graded pr algebra it is always easy to retrieve l d r m n as its homogeneous component of weight d in this paper we will usually not explicitly write down the weight of functors because this information is already implicitly encoded in the derived functors of the divided power functors 11 strict polynomial structure of the objects for example if r is a field of characteristic 2 and m a finite dimensional r vector space then the weight 4 component of r m 1 r m 1 3 is equal to 4 r m 2 r m m 1 2 r m 1 where these three summands live in degrees 4 5 and 6 respectively 3 4 some basic facts regarding derived functors of the divided power algebra before starting our computations we recall in this section some basic facts on derived functors of the symmetric algebras the exterior algebras and the divided powers algebras which give a clearer picture of the situation the following formula is due to bousfield 6 and quillen 30 see also 18 vol i chapter i 4 3 2 proposition 3 6 de calage let r be a commutative ring and let m be a finitely gen erated projective r module there are isomorphisms of graded pr algebras i d 0 li d r m n i d 0 li d d r m n 1 i d 0 li 2 ds d r m n 2 3 5 ifr is aq algebra there is an isomorphism of graded pr algebras sr m i r m i thus the de calage formula implies the following statement corollary 3 7 if r is a q algebra and m is a finitely generated r module then the graded pr algebra l r m n is isomorphic to r m n if n is even and to r m n if n is odd there is thus no issue in computing derived functors of divided power algebras over q algebras r we now give some elementary properties of divided powers when r is noetherian proposition 3 8 let r be noetherian and let m be a finitely generated projective r module then lj d r m n is zero if j n or j nd a finitely generated r module if n j nd if r z then for n j nd lj d r m n is a finite abelian group finally the graded pr subalgebra d 0 lnd d r m n d j 0 lj d r m n l r m n is equal to r m if n is odd and 2 6 0 in r and to r m otherwise 4 a quasi trivial filtration of the divided power algebra in this section we fix a field k of positive characteristic p 0 all the functors considered are strict polynomial functors defined over k we write d d and sd for d k sd k and d k a generic finite dimensional k vector space will be denoted by the letter v the goal of this section is to introduce some particularly nice filtrations of dg pk algebras which we call quasi trivial and to exhibit a quasi trivial filtration of the divided power algebra 4 1 quasi trivial filtrations a nonnegative decreasing filtration on a dg pk algebra a v is a family of subfunctors of a v i 0 f ia v 0 f i 1 a v f ia v f 0 a v a v satisfying the following conditions 1 f ia v d 0 j 0 f ia v dj with f ia v dj a d j v 2 the differential and the multiplication ina v restrict to morphisms d f ia v f ia v and f ia v f ja v f i ja v derived functors of the divided power functors 12 the associated graded object is then a dg pk algebra the grading which we will consider is the one coming from a v not the filtration grading we will simply write gra v i j d gr iadj v and gra d j v i gr iadj v definition 4 1 let a v be a dg pk algebra equipped with a nonnegative decreasing filtration f ia v i 0 we will say that this filtration is quasi trivial if 1 the algebra gra v is exponential and the components gradj v have finite di mensional values for all j and d and 2 there is a weight preserving isomorphism of differential graded k algebras a k gra k the next lemma gives some straightforward consequences of definition 4 1 the property c says that the graded pk algebras a v and gra v are as close as possible the filtration modifies the functoriality but not the algebra structure of a v lemma 4 2 let a v be a dg pk algebra equipped with a quasi trivial filtration then a the filtration of each summand adj v is bounded b the algebra a v is exponential c the choice of a basis of v determines a non functorial weight preserving isomor phism of differential graded k algebras a v gra v proof a since each adj v is a strict polynomial functor with finite dimensional values it is a finite functor in particular all filtrations are bounded 35 lemma 14 1 b the map a v a w a v w induced by the multiplication preserves filtrations and the associated graded map gr gra v gra w gra v w is an isomorphism by the first condition of definition 4 1 if we restrict ourselves to homogeneous components of a given weight d the filtrations on a v a w and a v w are finite so that is an isomorphism c a basis of v determines an isomorphism v ks we obtain the required isomor phism of differential graded algebras as the composite a ks a k s s gra k s gra ks where the first and third isomorphisms are induced by the multiplications and are iso morphisms since a v and gra v are exponential a crucial property of quasi trivial filtrations is that they commute with derivation proposition 4 3 let a v be a graded pk algebra endowed with a quasi trivial filtration for all n 0 there exists a filtration of the graded pk algebra l a v n and a functorial isomorphism of graded pk algebras gr l a v n l gra v n proof the filtration of a v induces a filtration of the dg pk algebra na v n the associated spectral sequence of graded pk algebras has the form e 1 i j hi j gr ina v n hi j na v n 4 1 while this is a second quadrant spectral sequence there is no problem with convergence since it splits as a direct sum of spectral sequences of homogeneous strict polynomial functors of given weight d and the lemma 4 2 a ensures that each summand bounded converges 36 thm 5 5 1 the first page of the spectral sequence may be rewritten as e 1 i j li j gr ia v n to prove proposition 4 3 it therefore suffices to prove that the derived functors of the divided power functors 13 spectral sequence 4 1 degenerates at e 1 this will be the case if we are able to prove that for all i and d the homogeneous components of degree i and weight d of the graded pk algebras l a v n and l gra v n have the same dimension note that we already know that they both are finite dimensional by proposition 3 8 this equality of dimensions follows directly from the observation that a k v n and gra k v n coincide as semi simplicial k vector spaces indeed the graded k algebras with weights a k and gra k are isomorphic and we claim that for exponential graded pk algebras e the graded k algebra with weights e k determines completely the semi simplicial k vector space e k v n the latter claim follows from the explicit construction of the dold kan functor k 36 sec 8 4 the simplicial k vector space k v n is degreewise finite dimensional say of some dimension dk in degree k if we choose a basis of v each k v n k has a canonical basis determined by the basis of v and if we use coordinates relative to these bases then for each i the face operators i k v n k k v n k 1 is given by a formula i x 1 xdk y 1 ydk 1 where yj i ij xi and i 1 idk 1 is some partition of the set 1 dk we therefore have commutative diagrams e k dk i e k v n k i e k dk 1 e k v n k 1 where the horizontal isomorphisms are induced by the multiplication of e v and where i sends x 1 xdk to y 1 ydk 1 with yj i ij xi this proves our claim and finishes the proof of proposition 4 3 another useful property of quasi trivial filtrations is their compatibility with kernels to be more specific let a v be a filtered dg pk algebra and denote by z v the subalgebra of cycles of a v the filtration of a v induces a filtration on z v by setting f iz v f ia v z v let z v be the subalgebra of cycles of gra v then we have a canonical injective morphism of algebras grz v z v 4 2 in general this morphism is not surjective but it turns out to be the case if the filtration of a v is quasi trivial proposition 4 4 let a v be a dg pk algebra endowed with a quasi trivial filtration let us denote by z v the cycles of a v and by z v the cycles of gra v the canonical morphism 4 2 is an isomorphism of graded pk algebras proof it suffices to prove that the homogeneous components grz di v and z d i v have the same dimension for all degrees i and all weights d or equivalently that the maps adi v a d i 1 v and gr gra d i v gra d i 1 v have the same rank this follows from lemma 4 2 c 4 2 truncated polynomial algebras the truncated polynomial algebra q v is the pk algebra obtained as the quotient of s v by the ideal generated by v 1 for all i 0 we denote by q v i the truncated polynomial algebra on a generator v placed in degree i this is defined in a similar way as the quotient of s v i by the ideal generated by v 1 i truncated polynomial algebras enjoy the following properties 1 if p 2 q v v but this is no longer true in odd characteristics 2 the pk algebra q v is an exponential functor in particular a pk bialgebra derived functors of the divided power functors 14 3 let us denote by s v v the unique morphism of pk algebras whose restriction v s 1 v 1 v v to the summand of weight one is equal to the identity it follows that q v is equal to the image of 4 q v is self dual namely there is an isomorphism of pk bialgebras q v q v all these properties are well known and easy to check we just indicate how to retrieve 4 from 3 since is a morphism between exponential pr algebras it is actually a mor phism of pr bialgebras hence its dual yields a morphism of pr bialgebras s v v s v v since and coincide when restricted to the homogeneous summand of weight 1 they must be equal so we obtain q v im im q v we finish this paragraph with a slightly less known result on trunctated polynomials namely the construction of functorial resolution of q v we equip the graded pk algebra s v v 1 1 with a differential defined as the composite sd v e v 1 sd v v 1 e 1 v 1 sd p v e 1 v 1 where the first map is induced by the comultiplication in v 1 and the second by composition of the inclusion v 1 sp v and the multiplication in s v the composite morphism of graded pk algebras s v v 1 1 s v q v induces a morphism of differential graded algebras f s v v 1 1 q v 0 4 3 proposition 4 5 the morphism f is a quasi isomorphism proof the graded pk algebras s v v 1 1 and q v are exponential functors hence for v kd there is a commutative diagram of differential graded k algebras whose vertical isomorphisms are induced by the multiplication s k k 1 1 d f d q k d s kd kd 1 1 f q kd thus by the ku nneth formula the proof reduces to the easy case v k example 4 6 in characteristic 2 the weight 4 component of the morphism of differential graded algebras 4 3 determines the following resolution of 4 v where 1 x y x 2 y y 2 x and 0 xy z xyz 2 0 2 v 1 1 s 2 v v 1 0 s 4 v f 4 4 v 0 4 4 4 3 the principal filtration on the divided power algebra we denote by i v the ideal of v generated by v 1 v we call this ideal the principal ideal of v although it is not strictly speaking a principal ideal the adic filtration relative to i v will be called the principal filtration of v the associated graded object is the pk algebra gr v n 0 gr n v n 0 i v n i v n 1 in this section we will compute in proposition 4 9 the graded object associated to this principal filtration the result which will be obtained in proposition 4 9 below deserves to be compared to the following well known assertion 10 expose 9 p 9 07 derived functors of the divided power functors 15 proposition 4 7 the choice of a basis of the finite dimensional vector space v determines a non natural weight preserving algebra isomorphism v q v v 1 proof by the exponential properties of v and q v v 1 as in the proof of lemma 4 2 the proof reduces to the case v k which is a straightforward computation to describe the pk algebra gr v we first need to interpret i v as a kernel by the universal property of the symmetric algebra the inclusion v 1 s pr k v induces an injective morphism of pk algebras sk v 1 sk v since sk v is an exponential functor and since frobenius twists are additive functors sk v 1 is also an exponential functor thus the natural inclusion above is also a morphism of pk bialgebras and it induces by duality an epimorphism of pk bi algebras v v 1 lemma 4 8 the principal ideal i v is the kernel of the morphism v v 1 in other words the multiplication in v yields a short exact sequence v v mult v v 1 0 4 5 proof if v v 1 v 2 by using the exponential properties of v and v 1 we obtain that 4 5 is isomorphic to the short exact sequence v 1 v 1 v 2 v 1 v 2 v 2 v 1 v 2 v 1 1 v 1 2 0 hence it suffices to check exactness for v k which is easy proposition 4 9 there is an isomorphism of pk algebras which maps gr n v isomor phically onto qn v v 1 gr v q v v 1 proof let i v nd be the direct summand of i v n contained in d v so that gr n d v i v nd i v n 1 d then i v nd 0 if d n and for d n the multiplication of v induces an epimor phism v n d n v i v nd 4 6 since the multiplication v n n v factors through the canonical inclusion of qn v in n v the maps 4 6 induce commutative diagrams qn v v d n 1 v qn v mult i v n 1 d qn v d n v i v nd by lemma 4 8 the cokernel of the multiplication v d n 1 v d n v is equal to d n p v 1 if p divides d n and to zero otherwise hence if p divides d n the map qn v d n v i v nd induces an epimorphism qn v d n p v 1 i v nd i v n 1 d and the quotient i v nd i v n 1 d equals zero if p does not divide d n we thus have a surjective morphism of pk algebras q v v 1 n 0 gr n v 4 7 derived functors of the divided power functors 16 which sends qn v v 1 onto gr n v to finish the proof we observe that epimor phism 4 7 is actually an isomorphism for dimension reasons it follows from proposition 4 7 that the direct summands of a given weight d of the source and the target of the epimorphism 4 7 have the same finite dimension propositions 4 7 and 4 9 have the following consequence corollary 4 10 there exists a quasi trivial filtration of v and an isomorphism of pk algebras gr v q v v 1 in the previous statements we considered the divided power algebra v as a non graded algebra or equivalently as a graded algebra concentrated in degree zero but we can define an extra degree on the divided power algebra by placing the generator v in degree i in that case the statements of propositions 4 7 4 9 and corollary 4 10 remain valid with v replaced by v i and v 1 replaced by v 1 pi since all the morphisms in those propositions preserve the weights and the extra degree is equal to i times the weight by iterating corollary 4 10 we then obtain the following result corollary 4 11 for any non negative integer i there exists a quasi trivial filtration on v i and an isomorphism of graded pk algebras gr v i r 0 q v r ipr 5 the derived functors of d k v in positive characteristic in this section k is a field of positive characteristic p all the functors considered are strict polynomial functors defined over k in particular we write d d and sd for d k sd k and d k a generic finite dimensional k vector space will be denoted by the letter v the main results of this section are theorems 5 1 and 5 6 which describe the derived functors of v these results were already proved by one of us in 35 where the proof was rather technical and relied heavily on the computations of cartan 10 the proofs which we will give here are more elementary and independent of 35 10 we will require theorems 5 1 and 5 6 as an input for the computations of sections 6 9 and 10 5 1 the description of l d v n in characteristic 2 theorem 5 1 let k be a field of characteristic 2 and let v be a finite dimensional k vector space for all n 1 there is an isomorphism of graded pk algebras l v n r 1 rn 0 v r 1 rn 2 r 2 rn 2 r 3 rn 2 rn 1 5 1 for example there is an isomorphism l v 1 r 0 v r 1 the homogeneous component of weight d of the graded pk algebra l v n provides us the derived functors of d v let us spell this out in the d 4 case example 5 2 for n 1 the derived functors l 4 v n are given by the following formula where f v k means a copy of the strict polynomial functor f v placed in derived functors of the divided power functors 17 degree k l 4 v n 4 v 4 n i 1 n 2 v v 1 3 n i 1 1 i j n v 1 v 1 2 n i j 2 i 1 n 2 v 1 2 n 2 i 2 1 i j n v 2 n 2 i j 3 explanation of example 5 2 in order to unpackage the compact formula 5 1 we list those generators of the graded pk algebra l v n which can contribute after applying a divided power functor or after taking tensor products to a summand of weight 4 of l v n these generators are of the following four distinct types i one generator v n corresponding to the n tuple 0 0 ii n generators of the form v 1 n i 1 corresponding to the n tuples r 1 rn with ri 1 rk 0 if k 6 i iii n generators of the form v 2 n 3 i 3 corresponding to the n tuples r 1 rn with ri 2 rk 0 if k 6 i iv n n 1 2 generators of the form v 2 n j 2 i 3 corresponding to the n tuples r 1 rn with ri rj 1 for a given pair i j with i j and rk 0 if k 6 i j then we determine all possible manners in which these generators can contribute to a direct summand of weight 4 of l v n the generator i can contribute to a summand of weight 4 in two ways namely a via a summand 4 v and b via a summand 2 v v 1 where v 1 is a generator of type ii the generators of type ii can contribute to a summand of weight 4 in three ways first of all by the method b listed before secondly via a summand v 1 v 1 where two generators of type ii are involved or thirdly via a summand 2 v 1 the generators of type iii and iv are already of weight 4 hence they can only contribute to the part of weight 4 as summands of the form v 2 finally we compute the degree of each of these summands of weight 4 and thereby obtain the sought after expression for l 4 v n more generally we may extract from theorem 5 1 the homogeneous component of an arbitrary given weight d this yields the following result corollary 5 3 let k be a field of characteristic 2 d be a positive integer and v be a finite dimensional k vector space there exists an isomorphism of strict polynomial functors li d v n r 1 rn 0 r 1 rn v r 1 rn 2 r 2 rn 2 r 3 rn 2 rn 1 where the sum is taken over all the maps nn n satisfying the following two summa bility conditions r 1 rn 0 r 1 rn 2 r 1 rn d 1 r 1 rn 0 r 1 rn 2 r 2 rn 2 r 3 rn 2 rn 1 i 2 derived functors of the divided power functors 18 5 2 proof of theorem 5 1 in this proof we will constantly use the graded pk algebras v r i and v r i to keep formulas in a compact form and to handle the degrees and the twists in a confortable way we denote these graded pk algebras respectively by r i v and r i v for example the homogeneous summand of weight dpr and degree di of r i v is d v r and the homogeneous summand of weight dpr and degree di j of l r i v n is equal to lj di d v r n with these notations theorem 5 1 appears the special case r i 0 of the following theorem which is the statement that we actually prove theorem 5 4 let k be a field of characteristic 2 and let v be a finite dimensional k vector space for all n 1 and all r i 0 the graded pk algebra l r i v n is isomorphic to the tensor product r 1 rn 0 v r r 1 rn i 2 r 1 r 2 rn 2 r 2 r 3 rn 2 rn 1 proof step 1 the quasi trivial filtration of the divided power algebra corollary 4 11 yields a quasi trivial filtration of r i v with associated graded pk algebra gr r i v s 0 r s i 2 s v 5 2 by proposition 4 3 derivation commutes with quasi trivial filtrations and by the moreover by the eilenberg zilber theorem and the ku nneth formula derivation commutes with tensor products we therefore have isomorphisms of graded pk algebras gr l r i v n l gr r i v n s 0 l r s i 2 s v n 5 3 step 2 de calage now we use the de calage formula of proposition 3 5 l r s i 2 s v n l r s i 2 s 1 v n 1 to rewrite the right hand side of isomorphism 5 3 in this way we obtain for all n 1 an isomorphism gr l r i v n s 0 l r s i 2 s 1 v n 1 5 4 step 3 induction we now prove theorem 5 4 by induction on n for n 1 l r s i 2 s 1 v 0 is isomorphic to r s i 2 s 1 v so that theorem 5 4 holds let us assume that we have computed l r s i 2 s 1 v n 1 by inserting the formula giving l r s i 2 s 1 v n 1 in the right hand side of isomorphism 5 4 we obtain that the isomorphism of theorem 5 4 holds up to a filtration to prove theorem 5 4 it remains to verify that the filtration on the left hand side of of isomorphism 5 4 is trivial this is a direct consequence of the following proposition proposition 5 5 35 prop 14 5 let k be a field of characteristic 2 and let a v be a filtered graded commutative pk algebra whose summands a d i v are finite dimensional assume that gra v is isomorphic to a tensor product of graded pk algebras of the form v r i then there exists an isomorphism of graded pk algebras a v gra v proof the proof is already given in 35 we sketch it here for the sake of completeness the starting point is the vanishing lemma a 6 which yields an isomorphism of graded strict polynomial functors f a v gra v the isomorphism f is not an isomorphism of algebras but we can use it to build one in the following way let us first recall that gra v is exponential hence a v also is by the same reasoning as in lemma 4 2 in derived functors of the divided power functors 19 particular both algebras also have a coalgebra structure determined by the multiplication as explained in section 2 one can check that the primitives of an exponential functor form an additive functor so the isomorphism f shows that the primitives of a v form a direct summand of the primitives of gra v let us denote by f v the primitive part of gra v that is the direct sum of all the generators v r i then f induces a monomorphism f a v f v but gra v is the universal cofree coalgebra on f v hence f extends uniquely to a morphism of graded pk coalgebras f a v gra v since f induces an injection between the primitives of a v and those of gra v it is injective and it is an isomorphism for dimension reasons finally the coalgebra structure of an exponential functor uniquely determines its algebra structure and vice versa so the isomorphism f is also a morphism of algebras 5 3 the computation of l d v 1 over a field of odd characteristic theorem 5 6 let k be a field of odd characteristic p and let v be a finite dimensional k vector space there is an isomorphism of graded pk algebras l v 1 r 1 v r 2 r 0 v r 1 5 5 remark 5 7 the reader might find it surprising that derived functors of are so different in characteristic 2 from what they are in odd characteristic however proposition 4 7 shows that theorem 5 6 is valid in characteristic 2 in a nonnatural way and proposition 4 9 shows that theorem 5 6 remains valid in characteristic 2 up to a filtration proof the proof is similar to the characteristic 2 case i e to the proof of theorem 5 4 step 1 the quasi trivial filtration of the divided power algebra corollary 4 11 yields a quasi trivial filtration of v with associated graded pk algebra s 0 q v s thus by proposition 4 3 and the eilenberg zilber theorem the graded pk algebra l v 1 is filtered and we have isomorphisms gr l v 1 l gr v s 1 s 0 l q v s 1 5 6 step 2 derived functors of truncated polynomials in characteristic 2 the de rived functors of truncated polynomials i e of exterior powers can be computed by the de calage formula of proposition 3 5 this is not the case anymore in odd characteristic the aim of step 2 is to prove an analogue of the de calage formula for n 1 namely an isomorphism of graded pk algebras l q v s 1 v s 1 v s 1 2 5 7 since derivation commutes with precomposition by the frobenius twist cf remark 3 2 it suffices to prove 5 7 for s 0 let us denote by a v the differential graded pk algebra s v v 1 1 introduced in 4 3 thus there is a quasi isomorphism f a v q v where the target has zero differential by deriving this quasi isomorphism we obtain a morphism of differential graded pk algebras na v 1 nq v 1 5 8 by definition na v 1 is the total object of a bigraded pk algebra equipped with two differentials the differential of the dg pk algebra a v and the differential d coming from the simplicial structure thus we have two spectral sequences of graded pk algebras converging to the homology of na v 1 the first one is obtained by computing first the homology along the differential and secondly the homology along the differential d thus its second page is given by e 20 t ltq v 1 and e 2 s t 0 if s 6 0 and this proves derived functors of the divided power functors 20 that 5 8 is a quasi isomorphism the second spectral sequence is given by computing first the homology along the simplicial differential d by the de calage formula of proposition 3 5 its first page is given by e 1 s t t s v s v 1 with the convention that t s v is zero if t s 0 we observe that e 1 s t is a strict polynomial functor of weight t p 1 s since the differentials of the spectral sequence are weight preserving maps di eis t eis i t i 1 they must be zero for lacunary reasons hence e 1 s t e s t thus we can conclude that there exists a filtration on the graded pk algebra l q v 1 such that the quasi isomorphism 5 8 induces an isomorphism of graded pk algebras gr l q v s 1 v s 1 v s 1 2 this is almost the formula 5 7 that we want to prove to finish the proof we have to get rid of the filtration on the left hand side this follows from proposition 5 8 below step 3 conclusion the isomorphisms 5 6 and 5 7 together yield the formula of theorem 5 6 up to a filtration to finish the proof of theorem 5 6 we prove that this filtration splits by applying one more time proposition 5 8 in the course of the proof of theorem 5 6 we have made use of the following statement whose proof is similar to the one of proposition 5 5 proposition 5 8 35 let k be a field of odd characteristic and let a v be a fil tered graded commutative pk algebra whose summands a d i v are finite dimensional if gra v is isomorphic to a tensor product of graded pk algebras of the form v r 2 i or v r 2 i 1 then there exists an isomorphism of graded pk algebras a v gra v 6 the first derived functors of over the integers in this section we work over the ground ring z in particular we write d d and sd for d z sd z and d z a generic free finitely generated abelian group will be denoted by the letter a and we will denote by a p the quotient a pa strict polynomial functors defined over prime fields will enter the picture under the following form if f pd fp the functor a 7 f a p lives in pd z in particular frobenius twist functors yield strict polynomial functors a p r we most often drop the parentheses and simply denote those functors by a p r we denote by d fp d fp and sd fp the symmetric exterior and divided powers functors considered as objects of pd fp the goal of this section is to compute the derived functors l a 1 the main result in this section is theorem 6 3 which gives a first description of these derived functors in section 6 1 we present and illustrate this result the proof will be given in section 6 4 while sections 6 2 and 6 3 contain preliminary results which will be needed for this proof we will further elaborate on this theorem in section 7 to obtain other forms of the result in the hope that one or another of these descriptions will be of direct use to the reader 6 1 the description of l a 1 recall from proposition 3 8 that the graded pz algebra l a 1 decomposes as l a 1 d 0 ld d a 1 d a 0 i d li d a 1 i a derived functors of the divided power functors 21 where the diagonal subalgebra d a is isomorphic to a 1 and where the ideal i a has values in torsion abelian groups thus if p l a 1 denotes the p primary part of the abelian group l a 1 there is an equality i a p prime p l a 1 to describe the graded pz algebra l a 1 it therefore suffices to compute the p primary summands p l a 1 as graded pz algebras without unit and to describe their d a module structure d a p l a 1 p l a 1 we shall describe the p primary summands p l a 1 by the means of koszul kernel algebras for odd p and skew koszul kernel algebras for p 2 which we now introduce definition 6 1 let p be a prime 1 we denote by kos the unique differential of graded pz algebras on the connected algebra fp a p 1 r 1 fp a p r 2 fp a p r 1 sending the generators a p r 2 1 a p r 2 identically to a p r 1 1 a p r 1 2 the koszul kernel algebra kfp a p is the graded pz subalgebra of l fp a p 1 consisting of the cycles relative to the differential kos the notation kos and the name koszul kernel algebra are justified by the fact which will be proved in section 6 2 that the differential graded pz algebra l fp a p 1 kos is the tensor product of all the algebras fp a p r 2 fp a p r 1 with a koszul differential and of the algebra fp a p 1 with the zero differential we will prove in corollary 6 20 that the koszul kernel algebra kf 2 a 2 is very closely related to the following skew koszul kernel algebra skf 2 a 2 definition 6 2 1 we let skos be the unique differential of graded pz algebras on r 0 f 2 a 2 r 1 whose restriction to the each of the summands 2 f 2 a 2 r 1 r 0 is equal to the verschiebung map 2 f 2 a 2 r 1 a 2 r 1 1 2 the skew koszul kernel algebra skf 2 a 2 is the graded pz subalgebra of l f 2 a 2 1 consisting of the cycles relative to the differential skos the following theorem provides our first description of the graded pz algebra l a 1 it will be proved in section 6 4 theorem 6 3 let a be a finitely generated free abelian group i the diagonal algebra d a is isomorphic to a 1 ii for any prime number p the p primary component p l a 1 is entirely p torsion in particular there is an isomorphism of graded pz algebras l a 1 fp d a fp p l a 1 iii there are isomorphisms of graded pz algebras l a 1 fp kfp a p if p is an odd prime 6 1 l a 1 f 2 skf 2 a 2 if p 2 6 2 derived functors of the divided power functors 22 remark 6 4 the description of the d a module structure on p l a 1 is contained in part iii of theorem 6 3 indeed part ii yields an isomorphism d a p l a 1 d a fp p l a 1 so that the d a module structure is obtained by restriction to d a fp p l a 1 of the multiplication of l a 1 fp the differentials kos and skos will be very precisely described in sections 6 2 and 6 3 so that one can easily write down explicitly the homogeneous component of weight d of each of the differential graded algebras l fp a p 1 kos and l f 2 a 2 1 skos and thereby compute explicitly l d a 1 for a given d more details regarding the systematic description of l d a 1 will be given in section 7 for the moment we simply provide the flavour of the explicit description of l d a 1 by writing down in detail the homogeneous summands of weight d of l f 2 a 2 1 skos for low d the family of complexes of functors obtained here does not seem to have ap peared elsewhere in the literature in weight 1 the complex consists simply of a copy of a 2 placed in degree 1 the complexes corresponding to the homogeneous summands of weight d ranging from 2 to 6 are the following ones where each differential can be charac terized as the unique non zero morphism having the specified strict polynomial functors as source and target 2 f 2 a 2 deg 2 f 2 a 2 1 deg 1 6 3 3

above are defined as the composites nf 2 a 2 n 2 f 2 a 2 2 f 2 a 2 n 2 f 2 a 2 a 2 1 where the first map is induced by the comultiplication of f 2 a 2 and the second one by the verschiebung morphism

map h 6 is induced by the verschiebung morphism and the multiplication of the algebra f 2 a 2 example 6 5 the 2 primary component of l 4 a 1 is given by 2 l 4 z a 1 a 2 2 1 2 f 2 a 2 1 2 4 a 3 where 4 a is the kernel of the morphism g 4 2 f 2 a 2 a 2 1 2 f 2 a 2 1 and a term f a i means a copy of the functor f a placed in degree i 6 2 the koszul kernel algebra the purpose of this section is to justify definition 6 1 that is to define the differential kos and to study some of its properties 6 2 1 koszul algebras let m be a projective finitely generated module over a commuta tive ring r we equip the graded pr algebra r m 2 r m 1 with the differential dkos defined as the composite dr m e r m d 1 r m m e r m d 1 r m e 1 r m where the first map is induced by the comultiplication in r m and the second one by the multiplication in r m if d 0 the differential with source e r m is zero the resulting commutative differential graded pr algebra r m 2 r m 1 dkos is called the koszul algebra on m proposition 6 6 the homology of the koszul algebra is equal to r in degree zero and is zero in all other degrees proof using the fact that r m 2 r m 1 is exponential proceed as in the proof of proposition 4 5 the proof reduces to the case elementary m r remark 6 7 the koszul algebra is a particular case of more general constructions 18 15 its name is illustrated by the fact that its summand of weight d is the dual via the duality of the more familiar koszul complex dr m s 1 r m d 1 r m s d 1 r m 1 r m s d r m 6 2 2 the koszul differential on l fp a p 1 let p be a prime integer to be concise we denote by lfp a p the graded commutative pz algebra lfp a p fp a p 1 r 1 fp a p r 2 fp a p r 1 6 8 if p is odd lfp a p is isomorphic to the derived functors l fp a p 1 by theorem 5 6 but this is not the case for p 2 however the algebra lf 2 a 2 will be considered later on we can endow lfp a p with the structure of a commutative dg pz algebra in the following way let us consider the factor fp a p 1 as a differential graded algebra with zero differential and the other factors of 6 8 as koszul algebras on the vector spaces a p r we define lfp a p kos to be the tensor product of these differential graded pz algebras by the ku nneth formula and proposition 6 6 we have proposition 6 8 the homology of l fp a p 1 kos is isomorphic to the graded pz algebra fp a p 1 we will now justify definition 6 1 that is we will characterize the differential kos by its values on the generators 1 a p r 2 of lfp a p for this we use the following tool derived functors of the divided power functors 24 lemma 6 9 uniqueness principle let k be a field of positive characteristic p and let v be a finite dimensional k vector space let a v be a graded commutative pk algebra of the form a v k k v rk ik k v r j we denote by g v the graded functor g v k 1 k v rk ik 1 k v r j and by a v g v the surjection induced by the projections of k v rk ik resp k v r j onto v rk ik resp v r j then the map 7 induces a injection between the set of differentials on the graded pk algebra a v and the set of degree 1 morphisms of graded functors a v g v differentials on a v hom 1 a v g v 7 proof of lemma 6 9 since a v is exponential and graded commutative the multiplica tion in a v induces an isomorphism of bialgebras a v a w a v w a morphism a v a v of degree 1 is a derivation if and only if commutes with which holds if and only if commutes with which holds if and only if a v a v is a derivation by duality lemma 6 9 is therefore equivalent to the statement that differentials on a v are completely determined by their restriction g v a v the latter statement is true since a v is the free graded commutative algebra on g v proposition 6 10 let be a differential on the graded pz algebra lfp a p i the differential is determined by its restriction to the summands 1 fp a p r 2 for all r 1 ii the restriction of sends the summand 1 fp a p r 2 into 1 fp a p 1 1 proof to prove ii we observe that by definition must send the summand 1 a p r 2 into the homogeneous summand of degree 1 and weight pr which is equal to 1 a p 1 1 we now prove i by lemma 6 9 is uniquely determined by the morphism kos lfp a p a p 1 r 0 a p r 2 a p r 1 6 9 if we denote by r resp r resp 0 the canonical projection of the right hand side of isomorphism 6 9 onto the summands a p r 2 a p r 1 and a p 1 respectively then 0 r r the source of the morphism 0 is the direct summand of weight 1 and degree 2 of lfp a p which is equal to zero so that 0 0 the source of r is the summand of weight p r and degree 2 of lfp a p which equals 1 fp a p r 2 if p is odd and 1 f 2 a 2 r 2 2 f 2 a 2 r 1 1 if p 2 now an easy computation shows that hompf 2 2 v r 1 v r is zero so that for any prime p r is determined by the restriction of to the direct summand 1 fp a p r 2 derived functors of the divided power functors 25 similarly the source of r is the summand of weight p r and degree 3 of lfp a p the latter is equal to 0 is p 5 to 3 f 3 a 3 a r 1 1 is p 3 and to 1 f 2 a 2 r 1 2 1 f 2 a 2 r 1 1 2 f 2 a 2 r 2 1 1 f 2 a 2 r 1 1 if p 2 an easy computation shows that there are no nonzero morphisms from such functors to the functor a p r so that r 0 it follows that hence is completely determined by the restriction of to the summands 1 fp a p r 2 corollary 6 11 the morphism kos is the unique differential on the graded pz algebra lfp a p which sends the generators 1 fp a p r 2 identically to 1 fp a p 1 the following variant of corollary 6 11 will be useful in the proof of theorem 6 3 corollary 6 12 let be a differential of the graded pz algebra lfp a p assume that all the summands 1 a p r 1 r 1 lie in the image of then there exists an isomorphism of dg pz algebras lfp a p lfp a p kos proof the only morphisms of strict polynomial functors f a p r a p r are the scalar multiples of the identity by proposition 6 10 is completely determined by its restrictions to 1 a p r 2 these restrictions must be nonzero in order to ensure that the expressions 1 a p r 1 lie in the image of so they are of the form rid with r f p now the required isomorphism is induced by the automorphism of the graded pz algebra lfp a p which sends the generators a p 1 and a p r 1 r 1 identically to themselves and whose restrictions to the generators a p r 2 r 1 are equal to rid 6 3 the skew koszul kernel algebra the purpose of this section is to justify defini tion 6 2 that is to define the differential skos and to study some of its properties we also prove that the skew koszul kernel algebra is up to a filtration isomorphic to the koszul kernel algebra introduced in definition 6 1 6 3 1 the skew koszul algebras in characteristic 2 let k be a field of characteristic 2 and let v be a finite dimensional k vector space consider the graded pk algebra k v 1 k v 1 1 equipped with the differential dskos defined as a composite dk v e k v 1 d 2 k v 2 k v e k v 1 d 2 k v e 1 k v 1 where the first map is induced by the comultiplication of k v and the second one is induced by the verschiebung map 2 k v v 1 and the multiplication of k v 1 if d 1 the differential with source 0 k v e k v 1 is zero the resulting commutative differential graded pk algebra k v 1 k v 1 1 dskos will be called the skew koszul algebra on v this name is justified by the following result which is a differential graded algebra version of corollary 4 10 proposition 6 13 let v be a finite dimensional vector space over a field k of charac teristic 2 the tensor product of the principal filtrations of k v 1 and of k v 1 1 yields a quasi trivial filtration of the skew koszul algebra and the associated graded object is isomorphic to the dg pk algebra k v 1 k v 1 2 k v 1 1 k v 2 2 id k v 1 dkos id k v 2 2 derived functors of the divided power functors 26 proof let us denote by a v dskos the skew koszul algebra and by b v d the tensor product of k v 1 0 of the koszul algebra on a generator v 1 1 and of k v 2 2 0 the tensor products of the principal filtration of k v 1 and k v 1 1 coincides with the adic filtration of a v relative to the ideal j v generated by 1 k v 1 1 k v 1 1 by definition the image of the differential dskos is contained in the image of the multipli cation a v v 1 2 a v in particular dskos sends j v to j v so the j v adic filtration yields a filtration on the dg pk algebra a v dskos by proposition 4 9 we have an isomorphism of graded pk algebras gra v b v we have to prove that gr dskos d by proposition 6 10 it suffices to show that the restriction of gr dskos to the direct summand 1 k v 1 2 v 1 2 sends this generator identically to v 1 1 1 k v 1 1 to prove this we write down explicitly the homoge neous weight 2 component of the j v adic filtration we have a v 2 2 k v 1 1 k v 1 1 j v 2 2 k v 1 and the component of weight 2 of the power j v n is zero for all n 2 the restriction of dskos to 2 k v 1 is the verschiebung map so that gr dskos 2 k v 1 v 1 2 v 1 1 is zero on the summand 2 k v 1 and maps v 1 2 identically to v 1 1 the fact that a k dskos is isomorphic to b k d is easily proved by direct inspection 6 3 2 the skew koszul differential on l f 2 a 2 1 we are going to define a differential skos on the graded pz algebra l f 2 a 2 1 r 0 f 2 a 2 r 1 to do this we consider for all r 0 the factor f 2 a 2 r 1 f 2 a 2 r 1 1 as the skew koszul algebra on the vector space a 2 r tensoring by identities on the left and the right this defines a differential r on l f 2 a 2 1 in other words each element in l f 2 a 2 1 can be written as a finite tensor product of elements xi f 2 a 2 i 1 and r is given by r x 0 xr xr 1 xn x 0 dskos xr xr 1 xn lemma 6 14 the differentials r commute with each other proof we have to check that i j j i since the i are differentials of algebras we can use the exponential property to reduce the proof to the trivial case in which a 2 is one dimensional we define the skew koszul differential skos as the sum skos r 0 r this infinite sum reduces to a finite one on each summand of given degree and weight we will now justify definition 6 2 that is characterize skos is by its value on the summands 2 f 2 a 2 r the following proposition is proved in the same way as proposition 6 10 proposition 6 15 let be a differential of the graded pz algebra l f 2 a 2 1 i the differential is determined by its restriction to the summands 2 f 2 a 2 r 1 for r 0 ii the restriction of sends the summand 2 f 2 a 2 r 1 into 1 f 2 a 2 r 1 1 corollary 6 16 the morphism skos is the unique differential on the graded pz algebra l f 2 a 2 1 r 0 f 2 a 2 r 1 whose restriction to the summands 2 f 2 a 2 r 1 r 0 equals the verschiebung map 2 f 2 a 2 r 1 a 2 r 1 1 derived functors of the divided power functors 27 we also have the analogue of corollary 6 12 since the verschiebung is the only nonzero morphism 2 f 2 a 2 r a 2 r 1 this characteristic 2 analogue yields a slightly stronger statement corollary 6 17 the differential skos is the unique differential on the graded pz algebra l f 2 a 2 1 whose image contains all the generators 1 f 2 a 2 r 1 for r 1 6 3 3 koszul versus skew koszul kernels the definition of the koszul differential on lf 2 a 2 and of the skew koszul differential on l f 2 a 2 1 are completely parallel we now compare explicitly these two constructions the following proposition follows directly from proposition 6 13 proposition 6 18 the tensor product of the principal filtrations on the graded pz algebras f 2 a 2 r 1 r 1 yields a quasi trivial filtration on l f 2 a 2 1 skos whose associated graded object is the differential graded pz algebra lf 2 a 2 1 kos corollary 6 19 the homology of l f 2 a 2 1 skos is isomorphic to the graded pz algebra f 2 a 2 1 proof of corollary 6 19 the morphism of algebras f 2 a 2 f 2 a 2 induces a mor phism of algebras f 2 a 2 1 l f 2 a 2 1 the image of this morphism consists of cycles and since l f 2 a 2 1 d i is zero for i d there is an injective morphism f 2 a 2 1 h l f 2 a 2 1 skos 6 10 we want to prove that the morphism 6 10 is an isomorphism for this purpose it suffices to check that its source and its target have the same dimensions in each summand of a given weight and degree but proposition 6 18 and lemma 4 2 c yield a non functorial isomorphism of differential graded algebras which preserves the weights l f 2 a 2 1 skos lf 2 a 2 kos by proposition 7 1 the homology of lf 2 a 2 kos is isomorphic to f 2 a 2 1 hence the dimensions of the source and the target of morphism 6 10 agree we also mention another consequence of proposition 6 18 which shows that the skew koszul kernel algebra is very close to the koszul kernel algebra it follows directly from the properties of quasi trivial filtrations lemma 4 2 and proposition 4 4 corollary 6 20 let a be a finitely generated free abelian group the choice of a basis of a determines a non functorial isomorphism of algebras which preserves the weights skf 2 a 2 kf 2 a 2 moreover there is a filtration of the graded pz algebra skf 2 a 2 and a functorial iso morphism of graded pz algebras grskf 2 a 2 kf 2 a 2 6 4 proof of theorem 6 3 theorem 6 3 i is already known by proposition 3 8 in this section we will prove theorem 6 3 ii and iii in corollary 6 23 the proof proceeds by running the bockstein spectral sequence we first need the following result lemma 6 21 let r be a positive integer and let p be a prime integer then the p primary part of the functor l 1 pr a 1 is equal to a p r moreover the morphism induced by mod p reduction yields an isomorphism p l 1 d a 1 l 1 d a 1 fp l 1 d fp a p 1 derived functors of the divided power functors 28 proof the complex n p r a 1 fp is isomorphic to the complex n pr fp a p 1 and n p r a 1 is zero in degree zero thus from the long exact sequence associated to the short exact sequence of complexes 0 n p r a 1 p n p r a 1 n pr fp a p 1 0 we obtain an isomorphism l 1 pr a 1 fp l 1 pr fp a p 1 but we know by 12 korollar 10 2 that the p primary part of l 1 d a 1 only contains p torsion the result follows let p be a prime number the bockstein spectral sequence 36 5 9 9 is a device which enables one to recover the p primary part of homology of a complex c of free abelian groups from the homology of the complex c fp provided one is able to compute the differentials in the spectral sequence we consider the bockstein spectral sequence for the complex c n a 1 which computes the derived functors of a since n a 1 fp is isomorphic to n fp a p 1 the bockstein spectral sequence is a spectral sequence of graded pz algebras starting at page 0 e 0 a i li fp a p 1 li a 1 torsion fp fp a p 1 with differentials dr er a i e r a i 1 the differentials in this spectral sequence are related to the p primary torsion of l a 1 in the following way i given an integer r 0 the p torsion of l a 1 is killed by multiplication by p r if and only if er a e a ii the injective map induced by the mod p reduction of the complex l a 1 l a 1 fp l fp a p 1 e 0 a 6 11 has an image contained in the permanent cycles of the spectral sequence and the image of the p torsion part of l a 1 lies in the image of d 0 we will now completely compute this bockstein spectral sequence proposition 6 22 the bockstein spectral sequence degenerates at the first page e 1 a e a and the kernel d 0 equals kfp a p if p is odd and skf 2 a 2 if p 2 proof by condition ii and proposition 6 21 we know that the image of d 0 must contain the generators a p 1 1 thus by corollary 6 12 in odd characteristic p or by corol lary 6 17 in characteristic p 2 we know that the dg pz algebra is isomorphic to l fp a p 1 kos if p is odd and to l f 2 a 2 1 skos if p 2 this proves the statement about the kernel of d 0 both dg pz algebras have homology equal to fp a p 1 whence the degeneration of the spectral sequence at the e 1 page corollary 6 23 theorem 6 3 ii iii for all primes p the p primary component of l a 1 consists only of p torsion and there are isomorphisms of graded pz algebras l a 1 fp kfp a p if p is an odd prime 6 12 l a 1 f 2 skf 2 a 2 if p 2 6 13 proof since the bockstein spectral sequence degenerates at the page e 1 the p primary component of l a 1 is entirely p torsion in particular if 0 i d the p primary component p li d a 1 is isomorphic to li d a 1 fp hence the map 6 11 sends p li d a 1 to the weight d and degree i boundaries of d 0 the homogeneous part of e 1 a of degree i and weight d is zero since this is the case at the e a level it follows that these boundaries are equal to the weight d and degree i cycles of d 0 derived functors of the divided power functors 29 7 further descriptions of the derived functors of over the integers we keep the notations of section 6 in particular the notation lfp a p from 6 8 the purpose of this section is to give a more detailed description of the derived functors li d a 1 than the one given in theorem 6 3 by theorem 6 3 we know that for all d 0 li d a 1 0 if i d or i 0 d a if i d skf 2 a 2 d i p odd prime kfp a p d i if 0 i d where the functors kfp a p d i and skf 2 a 2 d i denote the homogeneous components of weight d and degree i of the skew koszul kernel algebra thus to give a more detailed description of li d a 1 we need to describe these functors more precisely the following description of kfp a p d i follows directly from the definition of the koszul kernel algebra and the computation of its homology in proposition 6 8 proposition 7 1 let p be a prime then 0 kfp a p d d d fp a p 1 kfp a p d i 0 if i d p or if d p 1 i d 2 the nontrivial component kfp a p d i of highest degree i d is given by kfp a p d d p 1 d p fp a p a p 1 if p 6 2 1 k d p d kp f 2 a 2 k f 2 a 2 1 if p 2 3 for any positive integer i d p 1 kfp a p d i can be equally described as a the kernel of the map kos lfp a p d i lfp a p d i 1 b the image of the map kos lfp a p d i 1 lfp a p d i c the cokernel of the map kos lfp a p d i 2 lfp a p d i 1 proof let us describe explicitly the terms of highest degrees in the homogeneous compo nent of weight d of lfp a p an expression such as f a k means a copy of the functor f a placed in degree k and the exterior powers with a negative weight are by convention equal to zero so that the following direct sums are actually finite lfp a p d fp a p d k 1 d kp fp a p kfp a p 1 d kp 2 k k 1 d kp fp a p k 1 fp a p 1 1 fp a p 1 d kp 2 k 1 terms of degree d kp 2 k 1 the differential kos vanishes on the term d fp a p d and maps the rest of the first line injectively into the terms of the second line this proves 0 and 1 moreover by proposition 6 8 the homogeneous component of weight d of the complex lfp a p kos is exact in degrees less than d thus the degree d p 1 component of the kernel of kos is given by some terms from the first line if p 2 all the terms of the second line have degree d so all of them but d fp a p d contribute to the degree d 1 of the kernel of kos whereas the only contribution is the one of d p fp a p a p 1 if p 3 finally 3 follows from the decomposition of the homogeneous component of weight d of the complex lfp a p kos into short exact sequences the following description of the expressions skfp a 2 d i is proved exactly in the same fashion as proposition 7 1 derived functors of the divided power functors 30 proposition 7 2 the following holds 0 skf 2 a 2 d d d f 2 a 2 1 skf 2 a 2 d d 1 d a where 1 a 0 2 a a 2 1 3 a a 2 a 2 1 and for d 4 d a can be equivalently described as a the kernel of the unique nonzero morphism induced by the comultiplication of f 2 a 2 the verschiebung morphism 2 f 2 a 2 a 2 1 and the multi plication a 2 1 2 2 f 2 a 2 1 d 2 f 2 a 2 a 2 1 d 4 f 2 a 2 2 f 2 a 2 1 b the image of the unique nonzero morphism induced by the comultiplication of f 2 a 2 and the verschiebung morphism 2 f 2 a 2 a 2 1 df 2 a 2 d 2 f 2 a 2 a 2 1 c the cokernel of the canonical inclusion df 2 a 2 d f 2 a 2 2 more generally for i d 1 skf 2 a 2 d i can be equivalently described as a the kernel of the map skos l f 2 a 2 1 d i l f 2 a 2 1 d i 1 b the image of the map skos l f 2 a 2 1 d i 1 l f 2 a 2 1 d i c the cokernel of the map skos l f 2 a 2 1 d i 2 l f 2 a 2 1 d i 1 propositions 7 1 and 7 2 yield descriptions of the li d a 1 as kernels images or coker nels of some very explicit complexes however most of these kernels cokernels or images yield new functors which are not direct sums of some familiar functors for example by corollary 6 20 the functors d a are filtered with associated graded object equal to the functor kf 2 a 2 d d 1 described in proposition 7 1 in particular for d 4 there is a short exact sequence which is non split as we prove it in proposition 9 2 0 2 f 2 a 2 a 2 1 4 a 2 f 2 a 2 1 0 7 1 to describe the derived functors li d a 1 in more familiar terms in terms of classical weyl functors we will describe them up to a filtration in theorem 7 5 below by corollary 6 20 the description of the derived functors li d a 1 up to a filtration reduces to describe the koszul kernel algebras kfp a p up to a filtration for all primes p these pz graded algebras are the cycles of the tensor product of the algebra fp a p 1 with trivial differential and of the koszul algebras fp a p r 1 fp a p r 2 dkos for r 1 to obtain a description of the cycles of such a tensor product of complexes we will use the following result from elementary algebra lemma 7 3 let c a and d a be finite exact complexes of functors with values in finite dimensional fp vector spaces and denote by the differential on the tensor product c a d a there is a natural filtration of ker whose associated graded object is given by gr ker k i j k 1 ker dci ker d d j i j k ker dci ker d d j proof the proof is very much in the spirit of the quasi trivial filtrations of section 4 let us denote by xk a the kernel of the differential d c k ck a ck 1 a we define a two step decreasing filtration of each functor ck a by f k 1 ck a 0 f kck a xk a f k 1 ck a ck a derived functors of the divided power functors 31 then c a becomes a filtered complex and the associated graded complex is isomorphic to the split exact complex xk a xk 1 a degree k 0 id xk 1 a xk 2 a degree k 1 7 2 moreover there is a non functorial isomorphism between c a and the split complex 7 2 the complex d a is filtered similarly the tensor product of these two filtrations yields a filtration of the complex c a d a whose associated graded complex gr c a d a gr is the tensor product of two split complexes moreover the filtration of the complex c a d a induces a filtration of its cycles ker defined by the rule f i ker ker f i c a d a and there is a canonical injection gr ker ker gr 7 3 now the complex gr c a d a gr is non functorially isomorphic to the complex c a d a hence the ranks of the differentials and gr are equal thus the source and the target of the canonical morphism 7 3 have the same dimension and the morphism 7 3 is an isomorphism it follows that up to a filtration ker is the kernel of the differential of the tensor product of the split complex 7 2 and the similar complex for d a the formula of lemma 7 3 follows the following result follows from lemma 7 3 by induction on n lemma 7 4 let ci a 1 i n be a family of finite exact complexes of functors with values in finite dimensional fp vector spaces and let us denote by the induced differential on the n fold tensor product n i 1 c i a there is a natural filtration of ker whose associated graded object is given by gr ker k n 1 j 0 i 1 in k j ker dc 1 i 1 ker dc n in n 1 j to state our description of the derived functors li d a 1 we need to introduce the following combinatorial device for a fixed prime number p we can consider all possible decompositions of a positive integer k as a sum k i kip ri where the ki are positive integers and the ri are distinct positive integers since the ri are positive the existence of such a decomposition implies that p divides k there might however be many such decompositions each of these may be identified with a finite sequence of pairs of integers r 1 k 1 ri ki satisfying the following conditions i the integers ri and ki are positive ii for all i ri ri 1 iii kip ri k we denote by decomp p k the set of all such finite sequences theorem 7 5 let v be a finite dimensional fp vector space and let w d k fp v pd fp denote the kernel of the koszul differential dkos k fp v d k fp v k 1 fp v d k 1 fp v derived functors of the divided power functors 32 by convention w dk fp v is zero if k d or if k 0 for 0 i d the p primary part of li d a 1 is up to a filtration isomorphic to the direct sum d k 0 r 1 k 1 rn kn decomp p k n 1 j 0 i 1 in i k d j d k fp a p n 1 w k i k fp a p r n 1 j proof up to a filtration the p primary part of li d a 1 is given by the functorkfp a p d i let us denote by d v the complex given by the homogeneous component of weight d of the koszul algebra fp v 1 fp v 2 dkos by definition kfp a p d i is equal to the cycles of degree i in the complex d k 0 d k fp a p 1 ri ki decomp p k k 1 a p r 1 kn a p rn with the convention that direct sums over empty sets are equal to zero the left hand factors d k fp a p 1 are concentrated in degree d k we therefore need to compute the cycles of degree i k d of the right hand factors the homogeneous summand of degree i of the cycles of the complex k a p r is w k i k fp a p r given a sequence r 1 k 1 rn kn we use lemma 7 4 to verify that the cycles of degree i k d in the tensor product k 1 a p r 1 kn a p rn are up to a filtration isomorphic to n 1 j 0 i 1 in i k d j w k 1 i 1 k 1 fp a p r 1 w kn in kn fp a p rn n 1 j this proves the formula of theorem 7 5 the notation w dk fp v has been chosen in order to remind the reader that these kernels of the koszul complex are well known to representation theorists as weyl functors 1 5 to be more specific recall that given a partition 1 n of d and a commutative ring r the weyl functor w m pd r is the dual of the schur functor associated to the partition the functor w m may be defined as the image of a certain composite map 1 m n m m d m d 1 m k m where is a specific combinatorial isomorphism and 1 k is the parti tion dual to the weyl functor w m is denoted by k m in 1 5 for example k d m d r m and k 1 d m d r m in particular our functors w d k fp v are the weyl functors associated to hook partitions i e there is an isomorphism w dk fp v w k 1 1 d k 1 v see e g 5 chap iii 1 for more details 8 the maximal filtration on a in this section we work over the ground ring z we use the same notations as in section 6 in particular we write d d and sd for d z sd z and d z a generic free finitely generated abelian group will be denoted by the letter a we will denote by a p the quotient a pa and we will abuse notations and write a p r instead of a pa r for shortening the purpose in this section is to introduce the maximal filtration of a and the associated spectral sequence which will be our main tool for the computation of the derived functors l d a n for low d and all n as a warm up we finish the section by running the spectral sequence in the baby cases d 2 and d 3 derived functors of the divided power functors 33 8 1 the maximal filtration we denote by j a the augmentation ideal of the divided power algebra a j a 0 a ker a 0 a z the adic filtration relative to j a will be called the maximal filtration on a even though j a is not strictly speaking a maximal ideal in this algebra the associated graded object is the pz algebra gr a i 0 gr i a i 0 j a i j a i 1 remark 8 1 the maximal filtration is different from the principal filtration on a defined in section 4 3 compare the definition of j a with lemma 4 8 restricting ourselves to the weight d component of a the principal filtration yields a filtration of d a with f i d a j a i d a and associated graded components gr i d a f i d a f i 1 d a by definition the terms of the filtration can be concretely described as follows f i d a im k 1 a ki a m a 8 1 where the sum is taken over all i tuples of positive integers k 1 ki whose sum equals d in particular f i d a 0 for i d so that the filtration is bounded and gr d d a f d d a im a d d a sd a 8 2 where the inclusion of sd a into d a is determined by the commutative algebra struc ture on a it is also easy to identify the graded component gr 1 d a lemma 8 2 for any free abelian group a gr 1 d a 0 if d is not a power of a prime p and gr 1 d a a p r if d pr proof the composite d a comult k a a mult d a equals the multiplication by d k so by 8 1 the integral torsion of gr 1 d a is bounded by the g c d of the binomials d k 0 k d this g c d equals p if d is a power of a prime p and 1 otherwise hence gr 1 d a 0 if d is not a power of a prime and is a fp vector space if d pr in the latter case by base change gr 1 d a identifies with the cokernel of the map k fp a pa fp a pa mult d fp a pa where the sum is taken over all pairs k of positive integers with k d whence the result for 1 i d the graded components gr i d a are more complicated and their description involves new classes of functors we will use the strict polynomial functors 1 n v defined for n 2 on the category of f 2 vector spaces by 1 n v coker 2 f 2 v 1 sn 2 f 2 v u v 1 snf 2 v 8 3 where u x y z 7 x y 2 z y x 2 z the map u appears in the resolution of truncated polynomials introduced in section 4 2 in particular proposition 4 5 implies that 1 n v lives in a characteristic 2 exact sequence 0 1 n v s n 2 f 2 v n 2 f 2 v 0 8 4 derived functors of the divided power functors 34 remark 8 3 the functors 1 n v belong to a family of functors p e v introduced by f jean in 19 appendix a lemma 8 4 let d 4 for any free abelian group a gr d 1 d a 1 d 2 a 2 proof by definition of the maximal filtration there is a commutative diagram with exact rows the exactness of the upper row follows from lemma 8 2 for d 2 sd 2 a s 2 a mult mult sd 2 a 2 a mult sd 2 a a 2 1 0 f d d a f d 1 d a gr d 1 d a 0 hence the surjective morphism sd 2 a 2 a gr d 1 d a factors into a surjective morphism sd 2 a a 2 1 gr d 1 d a 8 5 now we check that the composite of the morphism u appearing in 8 3 and the mor phism 8 5 is zero for this let us take x sd 4 a y z a and let us denote by y resp z the image of 2 y resp 2 z in a 2 1 then it suffices to check that the surjection 8 5 sends xy 2 z xz 2 y to zero this follows from the fact that the elements xy 2 2 z and xz 2 2 y are both sent to the same element 2 x 2 y 2 z in f d 1 d a hence the morphism 8 5 factors to a surjective morphism 1 d 2 a 2 gr d 1 d a 8 6 finally we check that 8 6 is an isomorphism by dimension counting the source and the target are f 2 vector spaces let a 1 an be a basis of the free abelian group a then the products ai 1 aid with i 1 id form a basis of f d d a a basis of f d 1 d a is given by the products ai 1 aid for i 1 id and the products ai 1 aid 2 2 aid 1 for i 1 id 2 the latter elements can be written as the elements 1 2 ai 1 aid for i 1 id where at least two of the ik are equal thus the dimension of gr d 1 d a is equal to the number of d tuples i 1 id with i 1 id and at least two ik are equal by the short exact sequence 8 4 this is exactly the dimension of 1 n a 2 we can identify gr 2 d a in a similar and slightly simpler fashion lemma 8 5 let d 3 for any free abelian group a gr 2 d a is a torsion abelian group whose p primary part p gr 2 d a is given by p gr 2 d a 0 if d is not a sum of two powers of p a p k a p if d pk p with k 6 s 2 fp a p k if d 2 pk proof let t 2 a k d k a a and let t 3 a denote the direct sum t 3 a k d k 1 k 2 k k 1 a k 2 a a 1 2 k a 1 a 2 a the multiplication of the divided power algebra defines a map t 3 a t 2 a let us denote by c a its cokernel by lemma 8 2 c a is a torsion abelian group and its derived functors of the divided power functors 35 p primary part equals a p k a p if d pk p for a prime p and zero otherwise by definition of the maximal filtration there is a commutative diagram t 3 a mult t 2 a mult f 3 d a f 2 a so the canonical surjection t 2 a gr 2 d a factors into a surjective morphism c a gr 2 d a in particular gr 2 d a is a torsion abelian group and given prime p we have p gr 2 d a 0 if d is not of the form pk p and we have a surjective morphism a p k a p p gr 2 d a 8 7 if k the commutativity of the product in a implies that the morphism 8 7 factors further as a surjective morphism s 2 fp a p k p gr 2 d a 8 8 to finish the proof it suffices to check that the morphism 8 7 resp 8 8 are isomor phisms for d pk p with k 6 resp d 2 pk this follows from a dimension counting argument similar to the one in the proof of lemma 8 4 we collect the descriptions of the graded components gr i d a for low d in the fol lowing example the cases d 3 already appear in 9 example 8 6 for any free abelian group a gr 1 1 z a and gr i 2 a a 2 1 i 1 s 2 a i 2 8 9 gr i 3 a a 3 1 i 1 a a 2 1 i 2 s 3 a i 3 8 10 gr i 4 a a 2 2 i 1 a a 3 1 s 2 f 2 a 2 1 i 2 1 2 a 2 i 3 s 4 a i 4 8 11 8 2 the spectral sequence associated to the maximal filtration in order to study derived functors of d a for d 2 we consider the spectral sequence associated to the maximal filtration of d a this is obtained by filtering the simplicial abelian group dk a n componentwise according to the maximal filtration this yields the following homological spectral sequence e 1 p q lp q grp d a n lp q d a n 8 12 with drp q e r p q e r p r q r 1 as usual the maximal filtration on d a is bounded for any fixed integer d so that the associated spectral sequence 8 12 converges to l d a n in the strong sense we now use this spectral sequence in order to compute the most elementary cases that is the derived functors li d a n for a free and d 2 or 3 derived functors of the divided power functors 36 8 3 the derived functors of 2 a for a free for d 2 there are only two non trivial terms in the graded object associated to the maximal filtration of 2 a by 8 9 so that the spectral sequence 8 12 has only two non zero columns namely e 1 1 q a 2 1 if q n 1 and zero otherwise 8 13 e 2 2 q lq 2 s 2 a n 8 14 if n 1 then lis 2 a 1 2 a if i 4 and zero otherwise the spectral sequence degenerates at e 1 for lacunary reasons and we obtain l 2 a 1 a 2 1 1 2 a 2 8 15 if n 2 lis 2 a n li 4 2 a n 2 by double de calage so the spectral sequence gives a relation between l 2 a n and l 2 a n 2 this gives us the following result proposition 8 7 for any n 0 and all free abelian group a the only nontrivial values of li 2 a n are li 2 a n a 2 1 i n n 2 n 4 2 n 2 n even a 2 1 i n n 2 n 4 2 n 1 n odd 2 a i 2 n n even 2 a i 2 n n odd 8 16 proof the assertion is trivial for n 0 and it is known for n 1 by 8 15 we prove by induction that if it is true for n 2 then it is also valid for n indeed the spectral sequence degenerates at e 1 for lacunary reasons thus the result for n is valid up to a filtration and since there is at most one nonzero term in each total degree in the spectral sequence the filtration on the abutment is trivial 8 4 the derived functors of 3 a for a free by 8 10 there are only three non trivial terms in the graded object associated to the maximal filtration of 3 a so for d 3 the spectral sequence 8 12 has only three nonzero columns namely e 1 1 q a 3 1 if q n 1 and zero if q 6 n 1 8 17 e 1 2 q a a 2 1 if q 4 and zero if q 6 4 8 18 e 3 3 q lq 3 s 3 a n 8 19 if n 1 then by de calage l s 3 a 1 3 a 3 so the spectral sequence degenerates at e 1 for lacunary reasons and we obtain l 3 a 1 a 3 1 1 a a 2 1 2 3 a 3 8 20 if n 2 then lis 3 a n li 6 3 a n 2 by double de calage so the spectral sequence essentially gives a relation between l 3 a n and l 3 a n 2 the following result is proved exactly in the same way as proposition 8 7 proposition 8 8 let a be a free abelian group i for any odd positive integer n the only non trivial values of li 3 a n are li 3 a n a 3 1 i n n 4 n 8 3 n 2 a a 2 1 i 2 n 2 n 2 2 n 4 3 n 1 3 a i 3 n 8 21 derived functors of the divided power functors 37 ii for any even nonnegative integer n the only non trivial values of li 3 a n are li 3 a n a 3 1 i n n 4 n 8 3 n 4 a a 2 1 i 2 n 2 n 2 2 n 4 3 n 2 3 a i 3 n 8 22 remark 8 9 for a general abelian group a the values of the derived functors l 2 a n and l 3 a n are more complicated and we refer to 9 prop 4 1 thm 5 2 for a complete discussion the present discussion of the derived functors l 3 a n is related to that in 9 since the since the functor w 3 a emphasized there is simply the quotient group f 1 3 a f 3 3 a for the maximal filtration 9 the derived functors l 4 a 1 and l 4 a 2 for a free in this section we keep the notations of section 8 in particular a denotes a generic free finitely generated abelian group and a stands for z a we compute the derived functors l 4 a 1 and l 4 a 2 by the same methods as in propositions 8 7 and 8 8 the situation is slightly more complicated here indeed although the spectral sequence 8 12 degenerates at e 1 for lacunary reasons as in the computations of the derived functors of 2 a and 3 a we will have to solve nontrivial extension problems both to compute the e 1 page of the spectral sequence and to recover the the derived functors of 4 a from the e term of the spectral sequence the derived functors l 4 a 1 were already computed in section 6 and 7 the proof given here is more elementary and independent from the techniques developed there 9 1 the derived functor l 4 a 1 for a free the description of gr 4 a is given in example 8 6 most of the graded terms are elementary so that the corresponding initial terms of the spectral sequence 8 12 for m 4 and n 1 are easy to compute e 1 1 q a 2 2 if q 2 and zero if q 6 2 e 1 2 q a a 3 1 2 f 2 a 2 1 if q 4 and zero if q 6 4 e 1 4 q 4 a if q 8 and zero if q 6 8 to complete the description of the first page we have to describe the column e 1 3 that is the derived functors of gr 3 4 a 1 2 a 2 the presentation 8 3 of 1 2 a 2 determines for each n an exact sequence of simplicial f 2 vector spaces since for 1 2 a 2 the map u is injective 0 2 f 2 k a 2 1 n s 2 f 2 k a 2 n k a 2 1 n 1 2 k a 2 n 0 9 1 for n 1 this induces by de calage a short exact sequence 0 2 f 2 a 2 a 2 1 3 1 2 k a 2 1 2 f 2 a 2 1 0 9 2 in the category of f 2 vector spaces which describes e 1 3 6 as the middle term in 9 2 it also follows from 9 1 that the terms e 1 3 q are trivial for q 6 3 and this also shows that e 1 3 q 0 for q 6 6 the spectral sequence degenerates for lacunary reasons and since it has only has one non trivial term in each total degree there is no filtration issue on the abutment so we immediately obtain the following result proposition 9 1 li 4 a 1 a 2 2 i 1 a a 3 1 2 f 2 a 2 1 i 2 4 a i 4 9 3 derived functors of the divided power functors 38 and there is a short exact sequence 0 2 f 2 a 2 a 2 1 l 3 4 a 1 2 f 2 a 2 1 0 9 4 to solve the extension issue involved in this description of l 3 4 a 1 we prove the following statement proposition 9 2 the extension 9 4 is not split in fact ext 1 2 f 2 a 2 1 2 f 2 a 2 a 2 1 z 2 9 5 where the extension group is computed in the category of strict polynomial functors or in the category of ordinary functors thus l 3 4 a 1 can be characterized as the unique non trivial extension of 2 f 2 a 2 1 by 2 f 2 a 2 a 2 1 proof suppose that the exact sequence 9 4 is functorially split so that the 2 primary component 2 l 3 4 a 2 is isomorphic to 2 f 2 a 2 a 2 1 2 f 2 a 2 1 in that case the universal coefficient theorem yields a short exact sequence 0 l 3 4 z a 1 z 2 l 3 4 f 2 a 2 1 tor l 2 4 z a 1 z 2 0 the term in the middle is the value for v a 2 of l 3 4 f 2 v 1 by example 5 2 this is equal to 2 f 2 a 2 a 2 1 we would therefore have an injective map 2 f 2 a 2 a 2 1 2 f 2 a 2 1 2 f 2 a 2 a 2 1 by the methods of paragraph a 2 we see that there is no non zero morphism from 2 f 2 a 2 1 to 2 f 2 a 2 a 2 1 hence the exact sequence 9 4 cannot be functorially split we refer to lemma a 12 for the proof of formula 9 5 9 2 the derived functor l 4 a 2 for a free we compute the derived functors of gr 3 4 a 1 2 a 2 as in section 9 1 that is by the exact sequence 9 1 if n 2 there is no extension problem arising from the induced long exact sequence and we obtain li 1 2 a 2 n 2 f 2 a 2 a 2 1 i 3 n a 2 1 a 2 1 2 n 2 i 3 n 1 2 f 2 a 2 1 i 2 n 1 a 2 2 n 2 i 2 n 9 6 so we can compute the e 1 page of the spectral sequence 8 12 for 4 for n 2 the result is displayed in table 1 below in particular the spectral sequence degenerates at e 1 for lacunary reasons so we obtain the following result proposition 9 3 for a free we have li 4 a 2 4 a i 8 0 i 3 7 2 f 2 a 2 a 2 1 i 6 2 f 2 a 2 1 i 5 a 2 2 i 2 9 7 as well as a short exact sequence 0 a 2 2 l 4 4 a 2 2 f 2 a 2 1 a a 3 1 0 9 8 to complete the description of l 4 a 2 we have to solve the extension issue involved in the description of the functor l 4 4 a 2 this is the purpose of the following result derived functors of the divided power functors 39 e 1 p q p 4 3 2 1 q 12 4 a 0 0 0 11 0 0 0 0 10 0 0 0 0 9 0 2 f 2 a 2 a 2 1 0 0 8 0 2

extension 9 8 is not split actually we have ext 1 pz 2 f 2 a 2 1 a 2 2 a a 3 1 z 2 9 9 so that l 4 4 a 2 can be characterized as the unique nontrivial extension of 2 f 2 a 2 1 by a 2 2 a a 3 1 in particular we obtain l 4 4 a 2 2 z a 2 1 a a 3 1 proof the universal coefficient theorem yields a short exact sequence 0 l 5 4 z a 2 z 2 l 5 4 f 2 a 2 2 tor l 4 4 z a 2 z 2 0 9 10 the term in the middle was already computed in example 5 2 if the extension 9 8 was functorially split then 2 l 4 4 a 2 would be isomorphic to a 2 2 2 f 2 a 2 1 so that the short exact sequence 9 10 could be restated as 0 2 f 2 a 2 1 i a 2 1 a 2 1 a 2 2 j a 2 2 2 f 2 a 2 1 0 a dimension count in the category of f 2 vector spaces makes it clear that such a short exact sequence cannot exist it follows that 9 8 is not split the formula 9 9 and the identification of l 4 4 a 2 follow from lemma a 11 10 the derived functors of 4 a for a free in this section we assume that a is a free abelian group we will give a complete description of the derived functors li 4 a n for all i 0 and n 1 derived functors of the divided power functors 40 10 1 the description of l 4 a n for a free the main result of section 10 is the following computation theorem 10 1 let n be a positive integer if n 2 m 1 then we have an isomorphism of graded strict polynomial functors where f a k denotes a copy of f a placed in degree k and sums over empty sets mean zero l 4 a n 4 a 4 n 4 a 4 n 1 m 1 i 0 2 f 2 a 2 a 2 1 3 n 2 i m i 0 2 f 2 a 2 1 2 n 4 i m 1 i 0 2 f 2 a 2 1 2 n 4 i 1 m 1 i 0 n 3 j 2 i a 2 1 a 2 1 2 n 2 i j 2 m i 0 a 3 a 3 1 2 n 4 i m i 0 a 2 2 n 6 i m 1 i 0 n 2 j 2 i a 2 2 n 4 i j 2 here 4 a l 3 4 a 1 is as shown in propositions 9 1 and 9 2 the unique nontrivial extension of 2 f 2 a 2 1 by 2 f 2 a 2 a 2 1 similarly if n 2 m there is an isomor phism of graded strict polynomial functors l 4 a n 4 a 4 n m 1 i 0 2 f 2 a 2 a 2 1 3 n 2 i m 1 i 0 2 z a 2 1 2 n 4 i m 1 i 0 2 f 2 a 2 1 2 n 4 i 1 m 2 i 0 n 3 j 2 i a 2 1 a 2

are at least two major differences for the 2 primary part first of all if n is even there is some 4 torsion in l 4 a n provided by the summands 2 z a 2 1 on the contrary when n is odd l 4 a n has only 2 torsion secondly the functor 4 a appears as a direct summand with multiplicity one in l 4 a n when n is odd and does not appear in the formula when n is even we observe that the formula for l 4 f 2 v n in example 5 2 did not depend on the parity of n for n 1 theorem 10 1 is equivalent to proposition 9 1 and for n 2 it is equivalent to proposition 9 3 now theorem 10 1 easily follows by induction on n from the following statement derived functors of the divided power functors 41 theorem 10 2 let n 3 if n is odd there is an isomorphism of graded strict polynomial functors l 4 a n l 4 a n 2 8 2

n 1 a 2 2 i 3 n 1 i 2 n 2 a 2 1 a 2 1 i 2 f 2 a 2 a 2 1 3 n 2 z a 2 1 2 n 2 f 2 a 2 1 2 n 1 a a 3 2 n 10 2 the remainder of section 10 is devoted to the proof of theorem 10 2 the proof goes along the same lines as the computation of l 4 a 1 and l 4 a 2 in section 9 that is the relation between l 4 a n and l 4 a n 2 is provided by the analysis of the spectral sequence 8 12 induced by the maximal filtration of 4 a however for n 3 the analysis of the spectral sequence is more delicate than in section 9 as there now are nontrivial differentials in the spectral sequence also we will have to solve extension problems in order to recover l 4 a n from the e page of the spectral sequence 10 2 proof of theorem 10 2 from now on n 3 and we assume that theorem 10 1 has been proved for n 2 we are going to prove that theorem 10 2 holds for n the first page of the maximal filtration spectral sequence 8 12 for d 4 and n 3 can be computed by the methods introduced in paragraphs 9 1 and 9 2 for n 1 2 in particular the terms in the p 3 column follow from 9 6 and those in the p 4 column from the double de calage formula 3 5 the e 1 page therefore has the form depicted in table 2 derived functors of the

expressions in table 2 are the terms of total degree 2 n they will play a special role in the proof we will indeed prove that all the differentials of the spectral sequence are zero except some of the differentials with terms of total degree 2 n as source or target in order to obtain some information regarding the differentials of the spectral sequence we are going to use mod 2 reduction in the spirit of the proof of propositions 9 2 and 9 4 the universal coefficient theorem yields short exact sequences of strict polynomial functors where 2 g denotes the 2 torsion subgroup of an abelian

total differential we distinguish three steps in the analysis of the spectral sequence we first analyze the spectral sequence in total degrees i 2 n formulas 10 5 10 6 and 10 7 show that theorem 10 2 holds in degrees i 2 n then we analyze the spectral sequence in total degrees degrees i 2 n formulas 10 9 and 10 10 show that theorem 10 2 holds in degrees i 2 n finally we analyze the spectral sequence in total degree 2 n formulas 10 16 and 10 17 show that theorem 10 2 holds in degree 2 n 10 2 1 the spectral sequence in total degree i 2 n for i n or n 1 we have e 1 i e i for lacunary reasons since there is only one nontrivial term in total degree i there is no extension issue to recover the abutment hence we obtain ln 4 a n a 2 2 a 2 2 ln 8 4 a n 2 10 5 ln 1 4 a n 0 ln 1 8 4 a n 2 10 6 the case i n 2 is slightly more involved proposition 10 4 for n 2 i 2 n 1 we have li 4 a n li 4 a n 2 a 2 2 10 7 moreover if n is even the differentials d 12 n e 1 2 n e 1 2 n 1 and d 2 2 n e 2 2 n e 2 2 n 1 are zero if n is odd one of the two differentials d 12 n d 2 2 n has a 2 2 as its image and the other one is the zero map proof first of all by theorem 10 1 which we assume to be proved for n 2 we know the terms in the column e 1 4 in particular all the expressions e 1 i for i 2 n are direct sums of terms a 2 2 a subquotient of a direct sum of copies of a 2 2 is once again a direct sum of copies of a 2 2 so that e i is also a direct sum of copies of a 2 2 if i 2 n finally the strict polynomial functor a 2 2 has no self extensions of degree 1 so that e i li 4 a n for i 2 n since only functors of the form a 2 2 appear in total degrees i 2 n in the spectral sequence there is no functorial issues involved in these degrees and analyzing this part of derived functors of the divided power functors 44 the spectral sequence amounts to analyze a spectral sequence of f 2 vector spaces to be more specific if di n denotes the dimension of the f 2 vector space li 4 z n for i 2 n then the formula 10 7 is equivalent to the following equality for n 2 i 2 n 1 di n di n 2 1 10 8 we now prove 10 8 by induction on i we have dn 1 n dn 1 n 2 0 by 10 6 and if we denote by i n the dimension of the f 2 vector space li 4 f 2 z 2 n the exact sequences 10 3 and 10 4 and lemma 10 3 yield equalities dn 2 n n 2 n dn 2 n 2 n 2 n 2 n 2 n n 2 n 2 1 this shows that 10 8 holds for i n 2 now assume that n 2 i 2 n then the exact sequences 10 3 and 10 4 and lemma 10 3 yield equalities di n i n di 1 n di n 2 i n 2 di 1 n 2 n 2 n n 2 n 2 2 thus assuming that 10 8 holds for i 1 we obtain that 10 8 holds for i it remains to prove the assertion on the differentials of the spectral sequence by the formula 10 7 for n 2 i 2 n e 1 i has one more copy of a 2 2 than e i hence there are only two possibilities for each i ai the maps d 1 i and d 2 i are zero one of the maps d 1 i 1 d 2 i 1 is zero and the other one has image a 2 2 bi one of the maps d 1 i d 2 i is zero and the other one has image a 2 2 and the maps d 1 i 1 and d 2 i 1 are zero we observe that ai bi 1 ai 2 since e 1 n 1 0 an 2 holds we can therefore deduce the result by induction on i 10 2 2 the spectral sequence in total degree i 2 n if i 3 n then e 1 i e i for lacunary reasons and since there is only one nontrivial term in total degree i we have li a n li 8 a n 2 10 9 to analyze the spectral sequence in total degree i with 2 n i 3 n we will use mod 2 reduction so we first recall basic facts regarding mod p reduction first of all for any finite abelian group g the p torsion subgroup pg has the same dimension as an fp vector space as the mod p reduction g fp using this basic fact one easily proves the following very rough estimation which will be useful to compare the e 1 and the e pages of the spectral sequence modulo p lemma 10 5 let g be a degreewise finite differential graded abelian group with i gi gi 1 given a prime p we denote by pg p the subcomplex of p torsion elements of g then we have dimfp hi g fp dimfp gi fp rk p i the next elementary lemma is useful for a modulo p comparison of l 4 a n and the e page of the spectral sequence lemma 10 6 let g be a filtered finite abelian group for all primes p we have dimfp g fp dimfp gr g fp moreover the equality holds if and only if there exists an isomorphism of groups between the p primary parts p g p gr g derived functors of the divided power functors 45 proposition 10 7 let 2 n i 3 n there is an isomorphism li 4 a n li 8 4 a n 2 2 f 2 a 2 a 2 1 i 3 n a 2 1 a 2 1 2 n 1 i 3 n 2 f 2 a 2 1 i 2 n 1 10 10 moreover the differential d 1 3 2 n 4 2 f 2 a 2 1 l 2 n 8 4 a n 2 is zero proof lemmas 10 6 and 10 5 yield inequalities dim e 1 i f 2 rk d 1 i dim e i f 2 dim li 4 a n f 2 10 11 dim 2 e 1 i 1 rk d 1 i 1 dim 2 e i 1 dim 2 li 1 4 a n 10 12 we will now verify that the expressions 10 11 10 12 are actually equalities for 2 n 1 i 3 n thereby proving that the total differential d 1 i is zero in degrees 2 n i 3 n the universal coefficient exact sequence 10 3 yields an equality dim li 4 a n f 2 dim 2 li 1 4 a n dimli 4 f 2 a 2 n 10 13 the short exact sequence 10 4 and lemma 10 3 imply that dimli 4 f 2 a 2 n dim e 1 4 i 4 f 2 dim 2 e 1 4 i 3 dimci a 2 n we observe that e 1 3 i 3 e 1 3 i 2 ci a 2 n for 2 n 1 i 3 n it follows that dimli 4 f 2 a 2 n dim e 1 i f 2 dim 2 e 1 i 1 10 14 by comparing the sum of the inequalities 10 11 and 10 12 with the equality provided by 10 13 and 10 14 we can now conclude that the expression 10 11 and 10 12 are actually equalities for 2 n 1 i 3 n since total differential d 1 i is zero in degrees 2 n i 3 n and d 1 3 n 1 is zero by lacunarity we have d 1 3 2 n 4 0 and e 1 i e i for 2 n i 3 n furthermore since 10 11 and 10 12 are equalities lemma 10 6 yields a non functorial isomorphism e i 4 4 e i 3 3 e i li 4 a n 10 15 to finish the proof we have to prove a functorial isomorphism e i 4 4 e i 4 3 li 4 a n but the 2 primary part of e i 4 4 is a direct sum of functors of the following types a 2 2 2 f 2 a 2 1 a 2 1 a 2 1 2 z a 2 1 2 f 2 a 2 1 as no term of the form 4 a 4 a 2 f 2 a 2 a 2 1 or 4 a occurs in the degrees which we are considering here in addition e i 4 3 is one of the following functors 2 f 2 a 2 1 a 2 1 a 2 1 2 f 2 a 2 a 2 1 it follows from the ext 1 computations of appendix a that there can be no nonsplit extension of e i 4 3 by e i 4 4 except in the case e i 4 3 2 f 2 a 2 1 in the latter case the only possible nontrivial extension is an extension of 2 f 2 a 2 1 by a functor of the form a 2 2 k the middle term of such a nontrivial extension is a functor 2 z a 2 1 a 2 2 k 1 which has 4 torsion such a nontrivial extension is therefore excluded as this would contradict the isomorphism 10 15 since all possible extensions are split we obtain an isomorphism of functors e i li 4 a n this finishes the proof of proposition 10 7 derived functors of the divided power functors 46 10 2 3 the spectral sequence in total degree i 2 n the study of the spectral sequence in total degrees i 2 n and i 2 n has already provided us with some partial information regarding the situation for i 2 n let us sum up what we know so far the differential d 12 n 1 is zero hence e 2 n is a subfunctor of e 1 2 n if n is even then d 12 n and d 2 2 n are zero hence e 2 n e 1 2 n if n is odd then one of the differentials d 12 n and d 2 2 n is zero and the other has image equal to a 2 2 hence we have only two possibilities a e 2 n l 2 n 8 4 a n 2 2 f 2 a 2 1 a a 3 1 b e 2 n l 2 n 8 4 a n 2 a 2 1 2 f 2 a 2 1 a a 3 1 proposition 10 8 if n is even then l 2 n 4 a n l 2 n 8 4 a n 2 2 z a 2 1 a a 3 1 10 16 proof we already know that e 12 n e 2 n so we just have to retrieve l 2 n 4 a n from e 2 n by theorem 10 1 which we assume to be proved for n 2 l 2 n 8 4 a n 2 is a sum of copies of a 2 2 since a 2 2 has no self extension of degree one there is no extension problem between the columns p 4 and p 3 hence the extension problem on the abutment can be restated as a short exact sequence 0 l 2 n 8 4 a n 2 a 2 2 l 2 n 4 a n 2 f 2 a 2 1 a a 3 1 0 but the only nontrivial extension of 2 f 2 a 2 1 by a functor of the form a 2 2 k is given by a functor of the form 2 z a 2 1 a 2 2 k 1 thus we have only two possibilities for l 2 n 4 a n namely i l 2 n 8 4 a n 2 z a 2 1 a a 3 1 ii l 2 n 8 4 a n 2 a 2 2 2 f 2 a 2 1 a a 3 1 the difference between i and ii can be seen in the dimension of the f 2 vector space l 2 n 4 a n f 2 so we can use mod 2 reduction to determine which of the two pos sibilities is correct let di n resp i n be the dimension of li 4 a n f 2 resp li 4 f 2 a 2 n f 2 by proposition 10 4 l 2 n 1 4 a n is an f 2 vector space hence d 2 n 1 n dim 2 l 2 n 1 4 a n similarly d 2 n 9 n 2 dim 2 l 2 n 1 4 a n we have d 2 n n 2 n n d 2 n 1 n by 10 3 2 n 8 n 2 dim 2 f 2 a 2 1 dima 2 2 d 2 n 1 n by lemma 10 3 2 n 8 n 2 dim 2 f 2 a 2 1 d 2 n 9 n 2 by prop 10 4 d 2 n 8 n 2 dim 2 f 2 a 2 by 10 4 thus the possibility ii is excluded for dimension reasons so that i holds proposition 10 9 if n is odd then l 2 n 4 a n l 2 n 8 4 a n 2 2 f 2 a 2 1 a 2 2 a a 3 1 10 17 proof recall that we have only two possibilities for e 2 n namely a e 2 n l 2 n 8 4 a n 2 2 f 2 a 2 1 a a 3 1 b e 2 n l 2 n 8 4 a n 2 a 2 1 2 f 2 a 2 1 a a 3 1 derived functors of the divided power functors 47 we now list the possibilities for l 2 n 4 a n by the same reasoning as in proposition 10 8 one finds the following three possibilities where l 2 n 8 4 a n 2 denotes the expression l 2 n 8 4 a n 2 with one copy of a 2 2 deleted i l 2 n 8 4 a n 2 z a 2 1 a a 3 1 ii l 2 n 8 4 a n 2 2 f 2 a 2 1 a a 3 1 iii l 2 n 8 4 a n 2 a 2 2 2 f 2 a 2 1 a a 3 1 to be more specific i and ii correspond to the possible reconstructions of l 2 n 4 a n if a holds and ii and iii correspond to the possible reconstructions if b holds we can exclude i for dimension reasons indeed we can compute the dimension of l 2 n 4 f 2 a 2 n f 2 as in the proof of proposition 10 8 we find that diml 2 n 4 a n f 2 dime 2 n f 2 by lemma 10 6 this implies that l 2 n 4 a n is non functorially isomorphic to e 2 n hence it is a f 2 vector space thus i does not hold on the other hand we can exclude ii for functoriality reasons indeed the universal coefficient theorem yields a surjective morphism of strict polynomial functors l 2 n 1 4 a 2 n 2 l 2 n 4 a n if ii holds then we can compose this surjective morphism with the projection onto the summand 2 f 2 a 2 1 of l 2 n 4 a n to get a surjective morphism l 2 n 1 4 a 2 n 2 f 2 a 2 1 10 18 but the source of this map was computed in example 5 2 it is of the form l 2 n 1 4 a 2 n a 2 1 a 2 1 a 2 2 k for some value of k by the hom computations of appendix a there is no nonzero map from a 2 2 to 2 f 2 a 2 1 and the only nonzero morphism from a 2 1 a 2 1 to 2 f 2 a 2 1 is not surjective this contradicts the existence of the surjective morphism 10 18 thus ii does not hold it follows that iii holds 11 a conjectural description of the functors li d z a n in this section we return to the study of the derived functors li d a n for arbitrary abelian groups a we therefore drop strict polynomial structures and consider the derived functors as genuine functors of the abelian group a the combinatorics of weights however will still be present in the picture we begin with a new description of the stable homology of eilenberg mac lane spaces equivalent to the cartan s classical one we then use this new parametrization of the stable homology groups in order to formulate a conjectural functorial description of the derived functors l d a n for all abelian groups a and positive integers n d we finally show that the computations of the present article as well as some computations of 9 agree with the conjecture 11 1 a new description of the stable homology we begin this section by quoting cartan s computation of the stable homology hsti a lim n hn i k a n z hn i k a n z if i n to this purpose we first recall cartan s admissible words for the reader s convenience fix a prime number p a p admissible word is a non empty word of finite length formed with the letters p p and satisfying the following two conditions 1 the word starts with the letter or p 2 the number of letters on the right of each letter p or p in is even derived functors of the divided power functors 48 a p admissible word is of first type de premie re espe ce if it ends with a and of second type de deuxie me espe ce if it ends with a p words finishing on the right with the letter p will not be considered here there are two basic integers associated to a p admissible word the degree of is the integer deg defined recursively as follows the degree of the empty word is zero and deg p 2 p deg deg 1 deg deg p p deg the height of is the integer h corresponding to the number of letters and p in theorem 11 1 10 exp 11 thm 2 there is a graded isomorphism functorial with respect to the abelian group a hst a a 0 p prime x 1 p a p deg h x 2 p pa deg h where xi p stands for the set of p admissible words of i th type starting on the left by the letters p remark 11 2 cartan s proof of theorem 11 1 is based on the integral computation of 10 exp 11 thm 1 however it can also be deduced from the mod p computations of 10 exp 9 and exp 10 see also 4 and the universal coefficient theorem if one knows in advance that the stable homology only contains p torsion for primes p a simple proof of the latter fact is contained in 12 korollar 10 2 we now propose a compact reformulation of theorem 11 1 denote by a the set of sequences t 1 tm for some m 1 such that t 1 tm 0 for every a let o denote the number of distinct strictly positive integers tj in the sequence t 1 tm for any abelian group a we define an object b a of the derived category of abelian groups by the following formula st a t 1 tm a p prime a l z p l o 2 pt 1 ptm m 11 1 cartan s description of the integeral stable homology hst a of an eilenberg mac lane space k a n may then be rephrased as follows theorem 11 3 there exists functorially in the abelian group a a graded isomorphism hst a h a st a 11 2 proof we observe that there is a bijection x 1 p x 2 p where is obtained from by replacing the last two letters 2 of by the single letter p this bijection preserves the degree and decreases the height by one so that the p primary part in the description of hst a theorem 11 1 can be rewritten as x 1 p a p deg h pa deg h 1 11 3 we define an equivalence relationr onx 1 p in the following way for a word x 1 p its 2 p substitution is the word ofx 1 p obtained by replacing each occurence of the letter p by the group of letters 2 p for example the 2 p substitution of p p 4 p 2 is the word p 2 p 6 p 2 we say that two words of x 1 p are equivalent if they have the same 2 p substitution let be a p admissible word beginning with the letter p we say that a word is restricted if it is composed only of the letters and p i e no p derived functors of the divided power functors 49 occurs in the word the set r p of restricted p admissible words form a subset of x 1 p each equivalent class of x 1 p contains exactly one restricted admissible word so that we can rewrite the direct sum 11 3 as r p r a p deg h pa deg h 1 11 4 we can replace in 11 4 the indexing set r p by the set a indeed there is a bijection r p a defined as follows each restricted p admissible word has the form p 2 2 k 1 terms p 2 2 k 2 terms p p 2 2 ks terms 11 5 where s is the number of occurences of p and the ki are nonnegative our bijection is defined by sending such a restricted p admissible word to the sequence of integers s s ks terms s 1 s 1 ks 1 terms 1 1 k 1 terms 11 6 if we define the degree of a sequence t 1 tn a as the sum 2 p t 1 ptn and its height as 2 n then the bijection preserves the degree and the height now we describe the r equivalent classes in x 1 p let c be one such equivalent class containing a restricted admissible word of the form 11 5 the element in c are all the words which can be obtained from by substituting some groups of letters 2 p by the letter p observe that the number of groups of letters 2 p available for substitution is equal to the number of positive ki which equals o 1 where o is the number of distinct positive integers in the associated sequence 11 6 thus c contains 2 o 1 elements moreover there are o 1 i distinct words obtained from by exactly i substitutions and they all satisfy the conditions deg deg and h h i as a consequence 11 4 can be rewritten as a direct sum a o 1 i 0 a p deg h i pa deg h i 1 o 1 i 11 7 finally the graded abelian group pa 1 a p 0 is the homology of the complex a l z p and the object z p l z p is isomorphic to z p 0 z p 1 in the derived category this determines a functorial isomorphism of graded abelian groups by induction on n h a l z p l n n 1 i 0 pa 1 i a p i n 1 i 11 8 the statement of theorem 11 3 follows by combining 11 7 and 11 8 just as one speaks of stable homology one defines the stable derived functors 12 8 3 lsti f a lim n ln if a n ln if a n if i n as explained in appendix b there exists a graded isomorphism natural with respect to the abelian group a hst a d 0 lst s d a 11 9 by de calage the stable derived functors of symmetric powers are isomorphic to the stable derived functors of the divided power functors hence 11 9 can be used to obtain a description of lst d a however to obtain such a description we have to derived functors of the divided power functors 50 separate the various summands in other words we have to determine which summands pa and a p contribute to which stable derived functors l st d a to this purpose we define yet another integer associated to p admissible words let r be the number of occurences of the letters p and p in a p admissible word then the weight w is defined by w pr if is of first type and w pr 1 if is of second type then as explained e g in 35 section 10 2 the direct summand of hst a corresponding to lst s d a is given by the admissible words of weight d we have to translate this in the new indexation provided by theorem 11 3 we obtain the following description of the stable derived functors of the functor d a proposition 11 4 if the integer d is not a prime power then lsti d a 0 for all i 0 for any prime number p and any integer r 0 the following is true lsti pr a hi t 1 tm a t 1 r a l z p l o 2 pt 2 ptm m proof returning to the proof of theorem 11 3 we see that the bijection preserves the weights moreover all the words in the same equivalent class in x 1 p also have the same weight thus all the terms corresponding to the homology of the summand a l z p o have the same weight as now if is a restricted p admissible word corresponding to the sequence t 1 tn a then w p t 1 proposition 11 4 follows 11 2 the conjecture we observed in proposition 11 4 that the stable derived functors of d a may conveniently be repackaged by appropriately deriving those summands a p which most obviously occur in cartan s computation these being the summands which correspond to restricted admissible words that is the words which do not involve the transpotence operation p our contention in what follows is that a similar mechanism also works unstably to be more specific let a m a denote the subset containing all the sequences of length less or equal to m we can reformulate the definition of a m as a m t 1 tm t 1 t 2 tm 0 and t 1 6 0 11 10 for every a m we still denote by o the number of distinct strictly positive integers tj in the sequence t 1 tm the a m form an increasing family of subsets which exhaust a moreover a m can be interpreted as an indexing set for those stable summands a p corresponding to restricted admissible words which already appear in the unstable homology of k a 2 m 1 or equivalently in the derived functors l a 2 m 1 our conjecture asserts that the derived functors l a n are filtered and that the associated graded pieces have the following description if n 2 m 1 is odd there is an isomorphism functorial with respect to an arbitrary abelian group a gr l a n l a p prime a m 1 l a l z p l o 11 11 and if n 2 m there is an isomorphism functorial with respect to an arbitrary abelian group a gr l a n l a p prime a m l a l z p l o 11 12 derived functors of the divided power functors 51 the two isomorphisms above do not preserve the homological grading we will explain below how to introduce appropriate shifts of degrees on the right hand side so as to obtain graded isomorphisms for the moment we keep things simple by discussing the ungraded version of the conjecture both sides of 11 11 and 11 12 are equipped with weights and our conjectural iso morphisms preserve the weights to be more specific the weight is defined on the left hand sides of 11 11 and 11 12 by viewing gr l d a n as the homogeneous sum mand of weight d the weights on the right hand sides of 11 11 and 11 12 are defined as follows we view l d a and l d a as functors a weight d we wiew the factors l d a l z p l o and l d a l z p l o corresponding to a sequence t 1 as functors of weight pt 1 compare proposition 11 4 and weights are additive with respect to tensor products to describe more concretely the homogeneous component of weight d of the right hand sides of isomorphisms 11 11 and 11 12 we introduce the following notation given a prime integer p a nonnegative integer m a nonnegative integer d 0 and a family of nonnegative integers d a m which is not identically zero we denote by d d 0 d m p the positive integer defined by d d 0 d m p d 0 a m d p t 1 11 13 where t 1 denotes the first integer in the sequence that is t 1 the integer d d 0 d m p is the weight of the following objects of the derived category e d 0 d m p l d 0 a a m l d a l z p l o 11 14 d d 0 d m p l d 0 a a m l d a l z p l o 11 15 with these notations the homogeneous component of weight d of the right hand side of the isomorphism 11 11 is given by the homotopy groups of the direct sum of l d a and all the terms e d 0 d m 1 p such that d d 0 d m 1 p d for all nonnegative integers d 0 all families of integers d which are not identically zero and all prime integers p the right hand side of the isomorphism 11 12 has an obvious similar description finally we introduce suitable shifts in order to transform the isomorphisms 11 11 and 11 12 into graded isomorphisms given a prime integer p a nonnegative integer m and a nonnegative integer d 0 and a family of nonnegative integers d a m which is not identically zero we set d 0 d m p 2 m 1 d 0 a m p d 11 16 where the integer p associated to a sequence t 1 tm is given by p 2 pt 2 2 ptm 1 if m 1 1 if m 1 11 17 we also set e d 0 d m p a m d d 0 11 18 we may now state the graded version of our conjecture derived functors of the divided power functors 52 conjecture 11 5 let s be a positive integer an let n be a positive integer 1 assume that n 2 m 1 is odd then there exists a filtration on ls d a n such that the associated graded functor is isomorphic to the direct sum of the term ls nd d a together with the terms s e d 0 d m 1 p d 0 d m 1 p for all primes p all nonnegative integers d 0 and all famillies of integers d a m 1 which are not identically zero and satisfying d d 0 d m p d 2 similarly if n 2 m there exists a filtration on ls d a n such that the associated graded functor is isomorphic to the direct sum of the term ls nd d a together with the terms s d d 0 d m p d 0 d m p e d 0 d m p for all primes p all nonnegative integers d 0 and all famillies of integers d a m which are not identically zero and satisfying d d 0 d m p d the remainder of the present section is devoted to proving that the conjecture holds in a certain number of cases 11 3 the cases d 2 d 3 for all a and all n for s m 1 and d 2 3 there is no filtration to consider and conjecture 11 5 reduces to the natural isomorphisms ls 2 a 2 m 1 s m i 0 a l z 2 2 m 2 i 1 l 2 a 4 m 2 11 19 ls 2 a 2 m s m 1 i 0 a l z 2 2 m 2 i l 2 a 4 m 11 20 and ls 3 a 2 m 1 s m i 0 a l z 3 2 m 4

divided power functors 53 11 4 the case d 4 for a free and n odd we now proceed to prove that the conjecture agrees with our previous computations for d 4 a free and n 2 m 1 with m 0 in that case the conjecture says that up to a filtration l 4 a n is isomorphic to the homology groups of the following complexes i vii at the prime p 3 there is a single sort of complex a l a l z 3 4 m 4 k 2 0 k m i at the prime p 2 we have the five following types of complexes l 2 a l a l z 2 6 m 2 k 3 0 k m ii l 2 a l z 2 4 m 4 k 2 0 k m iii a l z 2 l z 2 2 m 6 k 2 l 1 0 k l m l 6 0 iv a l z 2 2 m 6 k 1 0 k m v a l a l z 2 l z 2 4 m 2 k 2 l 2 0 l k m vi together with the final term l 4 a 8 m 4 vii to verify that these expressions coincide with our computations from section 10 we proceed by induction on m for m 0 the formula for l 4 a 1 was described in proposition 9 1 we filter the term l 3 4 a 1 4 a in 9 4 and replace it here by the direct sum 2 a a 2 2 f 2 a 2 the result of proposition 9 1 then coincides with the present m 0 case once we observe that l 2 a 2 2 a 2 0 2 f 2 a 2 1 9 2 2 3 to prove that the formulas provided by the conjecture agree for a general n 2 m 1 with the computations of theorem 10 1 it suffices to show that the additional summands predicted by the conjecture when passing from l 4 a n 2 8 to l 4 a n agree with those obtained in 10 1 let us denote by g m the sum of all the terms i vii one verifies that g m g m 1 8 m where m is given by m a a 3 2 n l 2 a a 2 3 n l 2 a 2 2 n m 1 a l z 2 l 2 a 2 n m k 1 a l a l z 2 l 2 2 n 2 k in m we replace the expression z 2 l 2 by z 2 0 z 2 1 l 2 a 2 by 2 a 2 0 2 f 2 a 2 1 then m coincides with the additional summands occuring when one passes for n odd from l 4 a n 2 8 to l 4 a n 2 in theorem 10 2 provided we replace the summand 2 f 2 a 2 a 2 1 3 n in 10 1 by the direct sum 2 a 2 a 2 3 n a 2 a 2 3 n this proves the conjecture for d 4 a free and n 2 m 1 odd 11 5 the case d 4 for a free and n even we now proceed to prove that the conjecture agrees with our previous computations for d 4 and a free and n 2 m with m 1 it is straightforward to verify that the conjecture agrees for m 1 with the computation of proposition 9 3 since we know that l 2 a 2 2 z a 2 0 2 f 2 a 2 1 9 3 4 there is no filtration to consider in this situation the conjecture says that derived functors of the divided power functors 54 up to a filtration l 4 a n is isomorphic to the homology groups of the following complexes a g at the prime p 3 there is a single sort of complex a l a l z 3 4 m 4 k 0 k m 1 a for the prime p 2 we have the following complexes l 2 a l a l z 2 6 m 2 k 0 k m 1 b l 2 a l z 2 4 m 4 k 0 k m 1 c a l z 2 l z 2 2 m 6 k 2 l 0 k l m 1 l 6 0 d a l z 2 2 m 6 k 0 k m 1 e a l a l z 2 l z 2 4 m 2 k 2 l 0 l k m 1 f together with the final term l 4 a 8 m g to prove that the formulas provided by the conjecture agree for n 2 m with the com putations of theorem 10 1 it suffices to show as above that the additional summands predicted by the conjecture when passing from l 4 a n 2 8 to l 4 a n agree with those obtained in 10 2 let us denote by j m the sum of all the terms a g one verifies that j m j m 1 8 m where m a a 3 2 n 2 a a 2 3 n l 2 a 2 2 n m 1 l 1 a l z 2 l z 2 2 n 2 l a 2 m 1 k 1 a 2 l a 2 4 m 2 k we replace in m the summand l 2 a 2 by its value 2 z a 2 0 2 f 2 a 2 1 as in 9 2 2 3 4 and once more replace z 2 l z 2 by z 2 0 z 2 1 then m coincides with the additional summands occuring when one passes for n even from l 4 a n 2 8 to l 4 a n 2 in theorem 10 2 note that in this n even case no summand in m requires any filtering 11 6 the case n 1 a free and all d in the case n 1 and a free the conjecture asserts that up to a filtration the p primary part of l d a 1 is isomorphic to k 0 k 1 kd k 0 a l l k 1 a p l l l kd a p k 0 kd 11 25 where the sum runs over all sequences of nonnegative integers k 0 k 1 kd of length exactly d 1 satisfying kip i d on the other hand we have explicitly computed the derived functors l a 1 in section 6 by theorem 6 3 and proposition 6 18 the p primary part of li d a 1 is concentrated in degrees i d and it is isomorphic up to a filtration in these degrees to the homogeneous component of degree i and weight d of the cycles of the tensor product of an exterior algebra with trivial differential and a family of koszul algebras fp a p 1 0 r 1 fp a p r 1 fp a p r 2 dkos 11 26 derived functors of the divided power functors 55 we will now reformulate this result in a different form closer to 11 25 for this we con sider the following modification of the koszul algebra over z namely the dg pz algebra a 2 a 1 pdkos with the same underlying graded pz algebra but whose dif ferential is the koszul differential multiplied by p we denote by ck a the complex of functors given by its homogeneous component of weight k lemma 11 6 for i d the p primary part of the functor li d a 1 is isomorphic to the homology of the complex k 0 kd k 0 a k 0 0 ck 1 a ckd a where the sum runs over all sequences of nonnegative integers k 0 k 1 kd satisfying kip i d remark 11 7 the isomorphism of lemma 11 6 is really an isomorphism of functors not an isomorphism of strict polynomial functors for example this isomorphism does not preserve the weights proof of lemma 11 6 step 1 since we are interested in the homogeneous component of weight d of 11 26 we can limit ourselves to the differential graded subalgebra of 11 26 fp a p 1 0 1 r d fp a p r 1 fp a p r 2 dkos 11 27 by forgeting the strict polynomial structure the strict polynomial functors a p r become isomorphic to a p and the differential graded algebra 11 27 is functorially isomorphic to the differential graded algebra fp a p 1 0 1 r d fp a p 1 fp a p 2 dkos 11 28 moreover under this isomorphism the homogeneous summand of weight d of 11 27 corresponds to the homogeneous summand of 11 28 supported by the subfunctors k 0 fp a p 1 a 1 fp a p b 1 fp a p a fp a p b fp a p 11 29 where the sum runs over all sequences k 0 a 1 b 1 a b satisfying k 0 ai bi p i d step 2 we claim that the subalgebra of cycles of positive degree of functorial graded algebra 11 28 is isomorphic to the homology algebra of z a 1 0 1 r d z a 1 z a 2 pdkos 11 30 and we claim that the isomorphism sends the kernels of the summand 11 29 of the dif ferential graded algebra 11 28 isomorphically to the homology of the following summand of the differential graded algebra 11 30 k 0 kd k 0 a 1 0 ck 1 a ckd a where the sum runs over all sequences of nonnegative integers k 0 k 1 kd satisfying kip i d the statement of lemma 11 6 follows from this claim so to finish the proof of lemma 11 6 we only have to justify our claim koszul algebras are acyclic in positive degrees by proposition 6 6 hence the positive degree homology of the differential graded algebra 11 30 is equal to the mod p reduction derived functors of the divided power functors 56 of the algebra formed by the cycles of positive degree of z a 1 0 1 r d z a 1 z a 2 dkos the latter is isomorphic to the algebra formed by the cycles of positive degree of the algebra 11 28 this justifies our claim we are now going to check that the graded functor 11 25 can also be rewritten as the homology of the complex of lemma 11 6 this will follow from the following lemma recall that ck a is the homogeneous part of weight k of a 2 a 1 pdkos hence its desuspension ck a k is the homogeneous part of weight k of a 1 a 0 pdkos lemma 11 8 let a be a free abelian group and let k be a positive integer the normalized chains of l k a p are naturally isomorphic to the complex ck a k proof we have l a p k a p a the functor k is explicit and we readily check that for all complexes c 1 c 0 the normalized chains of the simplicial object k c 1 c 0 is the complex whose degree n component is 0 c 1 n c 0 where 0 ci stands for the augmentation ideal of the exterior algebra and whose dif ferential maps an element x 1 xn y to the sum n 1 i 1 1 ix 1 xixi 1 xn y 1 nx 1 xn 1 xn y consider the normalized chains n a p of l a p as a differential graded pz algebra its homogeneous component of weight k yields the normalized chains n k a p of l k a p these normalized chains contain ck a k as a subcomplex indeed the inclusion is simply given by seeing the object of degree i of ck a k that is the functor i a k i a as a subfunctor of 1 a i k i a by the canonical inclusion of invariants into the tensor product one readily checks that the differential of ck a k coincides with the restriction of the differential of n k a p to finish the proof it remains to show that the inclusion of complexes ck a k n k a p 11 31 is a quasi isomorphism for this we filter both complexes by the weight of the exterior power on the right that is the term fs c k a k of the filtration is the subcomplex of ck a supported by the i a k i a for k i s and the term fs n k a p is the subcomplex of n k a p supported by the i 1 a in a k ij a for k ij s both filtrations have finite length and the inclusion of complexes preserves the filtrations whence a morphism gr ck a k gr n k a p 11 32 since the filtrations are finite the fact that 11 31 is a quasi isomorphism will follow from the fact that 11 32 is but we readily check that gr ck a k is equal to the complex k i 0 i a k a 0 with zero differential that gr n k a p is equal to the complex k i 0 n i a k a 0 and that the morphism 11 32 is simply the morphism constructed from the quasi isomorphisms i a i n i a this proves that 11 32 is a quasi isomorphism hence that 11 31 is a quasi isomorphism the results of lemma 11 6 and 11 8 together prove the following proposition proposition 11 9 the conjecture holds for n 1 and a a free abelian group derived functors of the divided power functors 57 appendix a some computations of hom and ext 1 in functor categories in this appendix we review some elementary computations of hom and ext 1 in functor categories the functor categories which we are considering are the following 1 the category fz of functors from free abelian groups of finite type to abelian groups 2 the category pk of strict polynomial functors defined over a field k 3 the category pz of strict polynomial functors defined over z these categories are related by exact faithful functors pfp pz pz fz to be more specific the first one sends a functor f v pfp to f a p considered as a functor of the variable a the second one is the forgetful functor from strict polynomial functors to ordinary functors since they are exact these functors induce morphisms on the level of ext groups in particular the computation of a hom or ext 1 in any of these three categories gives us partial information regarding the hom or the ext 1 in the other two we will be more precise about this below a 1 general techniques for ext computations we first recall some techniques from standard homological algebra which are efficient when computing ext groups in the functor categories that we are considering we refer the reader to the articles 16 15 35 28 for more details and further techniques for computing ext groups first of all by the yoneda lemma the functors pb a zhomz b a with a as the variable and a free finitely generated abelian group b as a parameter are projective generators in fz and we have for any functor f a extifz p b a f a f b if i 0 and 0 if i 0 a 1 the functors d n r m d r homr n m where n m are finitely generated free r modules and d is a nonnegative integer provide a family of projective generators of the categories pr of strict polynomial functors over a commutative ring r for any strict polynomial functor f m in pr we have a formula analoguous to a 1 where f d m denotes the homogeneous component of weight d of f m extipr d n r m f m f d n if i 0 and 0 if i 0 a 2 compared to the category fz the categories of strict polynomial functors have the pleasant additional feature that functors are equipped with weights and that for any pair of homogeneous strict polynomial functors f m g m of distinct weights we have ext pr f m g m 0 among the classical techniques for computing ext groups in our categories one of the most important ones is the sum diagonal adjunction which we will now recall for all functors f a g a h a in fz there are isomorphisms ext fz h a f a g a ext fz 2 h a b f a g b a 3 ext fz f a g a h a ext fz 2 f a g b h a b a 4 where the terms on the right hand side denote ext groups computed in the category fz 2 of bifunctors whose variables are denoted here by a and b in many cases for example if h a 2 z a one can express h a b as a direct sum of functors of the form h 1 a h 2 b such bifunctors are sometimes called of separable type thus a 4 leads us to consider extension groups of the form ext fz 2 h 1 a h 2 b f a g b derived functors of the divided power functors 58 there are several situations in which we can actually compute such ext groups for exam ple these extension groups vanish if h 2 b is a constant functor and g 0 0 together with the sum diagonal adjunction this yields the following fundamental vanishing lemma lemma a 1 27 let h a be an additive functor and let f a g a be a pair of functors satisfying f 0 g 0 0 then we have ext fz h a f a g a 0 ext fz f a g a h a the following proposition gives another example for which we can compute ext groups between functors of separable type proposition a 2 ku nneth formulas let f a g a fz be a pair of functors with values in fp vector spaces and let h 1 a h 2 a fz assume that h 1 a or h 2 a has values in free abelian groups then there is an isomorphism ext fz h 1 f ext fz h 2 g ext fz 2 h 1 h 2 f g to be concise we have dropped the variables in the previous formula and denoted by f g the bifunctor f g a b f a g b assume instead that h 1 a and h 2 a both take values in fp vector spaces and denote by e the graded fp vector space e ext fz h 1 f ext fz h 2 g then there is an isomorphism ext 0 fz 2 h 1 h 2 f g e 0 and a long exact sequence of fp vector spaces 0 ext 1 fz 2 h 1 h 2 f g e 1 ext 0 fz 2 h 1 h 2 f g ext 2 fz 2 h 1 h 2 f g e 2 ext 1 fz 2 h 1 h 2 f g proof in this proof we use of the concise notation h 1 a f a for hom groups between h 1 a and f a let p x a and p y a be standard projectives of fz the bifunctor px a p y b z homz x a homz y b is a projective object of fz 2 and the yoneda lemma yields an isomorphism px a p y b f a g b f x g y moreover the canonical morphism px a f a p y a g a px a p y b f a g b a 5 can be identified via the yoneda lemma with the identity morphism of f x g y in particular the map a 5 is an isomorphism let p 1 a resp p 2 a be a projective resolution of h 1 a resp h 2 a by a 5 there is an isomorphism of complexes p 1 a f a p 2 b g b p 1 a p 2 b f a g b a 6 the left hand side of a 6 is a tensor product of two complexes of fp vector spaces hence by the ku nneth formula its homology is isomorphic to ext fz h 1 a f a ext fz h 2 a g a assume that the values of one of the functors h 1 a h 2 a are free abelian groups then the complex p 1 a p 2 b is a projective resolution of h 1 a h 2 b hence the homology of the right hand side of a 6 is isomorphic to ext fz 2 h 1 a h 2 b f a g b we thus obtain the first assertion of proposition a 2 assume instead that both functors h 1 a h 2 a have values in fp vector spaces then p 1 a p 2 b is complex of projectives whose homology is equal to h 1 a h 2 b derived functors of the divided power functors 59 in degrees 0 and 1 and is trivial elsewhere it follows that there is a hypercohomology spectral sequence 36 5 7 9 with second page e p q 2 ext p fz 2 h 1 a h 2 b f a g b if q 1 2 and 0 if q 6 1 2 and differential d 2 e p q 2 e p 2 q 1 2 and which converges to the homology of the right hand side of a 6 this implies the second statement in proposition a 2 the sum diagonal adjunction works exactly in the same way for strict polynomial func tors over any commutative ring r the isomorphism a 4 remains valid when fz is replaced by pr for extension groups between strict polynomial bifunctors of separable type the ku nneth formulas of proposition a 2 remain valid if fz is replaced by pz the vanishing lemma a 1 also holds if we are interested in strict polynomial functors defined over a field k the situation is even nicer in that case we always have an isomorphism ext pk h 1 f ext pk h 2 g ext pk 2 h 1 h 2 f g a 2 some hom computations the following elementary lemma allows us to compare homs between the functor categories under consideration lemma a 3 the functor pfp pz defined by evaluation on a p is full and faithful the forgetful functor pz fz is faithful proof it is clear that both functors are faithful the only thing that we have to prove is the following isomorphism for all f v g v pfp hompfp f v g v hompz f a p g a p a 7 by left exactness of hom the proof reduces to the case where f v is a standard projec tive i e f v d u fp v with u fnp now observe that d u fp a p d b z a fp with b zn thus we have a commutative diagram hompfp d u fp v g v 1 hompz d u fp a p g a p gd u gd b p hompz d b z a p g a p 2 oo where gd v is the homogeneous component of weight d of g v the maps 1 and 2 are provided by the yoneda lemma and the vertical map on the right is induced by the canonical projection d b z a d u fp a p hence the isomorphism a 7 holds the forgetful functor pz fz is not full in general for example there is no non zero morphism of strict polynomial functors from a p 1 to a p because these strict polynomial functors are homogeneous of different weights however the forgetful functor sends both of these to the same ordinary functor a p and the identity morphism is a non zero morphism a p a p the following lemma is proved in a similar manner as lemma a 3 reduce to the case where f v is a standard projective and then use the yoneda lemma lemma a 4 let k be a field for all strict polynomial functors f v g v precompo sition by the frobenius twist v 7 v 1 induces an isomorphism hompk f v g v hompk f v 1 g v 1 derived functors of the divided power functors 60 let k be a field table 3 gathers some elementary hom computations in pk which follow from the left exactness of hom and the techniques recalled in section a 1 by lemma a 3 these also provide hom computations in pz one can also verify by using the techniques recalled in section a 1 that the computations of homfz f a p g a p for the functors f v and g v listed in the following table give the same result as in pz hompf 2 f v g v f v pr k v v p r v r sp r v p r v g v pr k v k k 0 k 0 if p 6 2 k if p 2 v p r k k pr 0 k k v r

computations a 3 1 computations in pk with k a field of positive characteristic the results given here are all well known as special cases of more general statements see e g 35 33 but we give here some self contained and elementary proofs lemma a 5 let k be a field of positive characteristic and consider f v g v pk with finite dimensional values precomposition by the frobenius twist induces an isomorphism ext 1 pk f v g v ext 1 pk f v 1 g v 1 proof there is a short exact sequence 0 kf v pf v f v 0 where pf v is a finite direct sum of standard projectives i e of functors of the form d u k v similarly applying the duality of section 2 3 to the one step projective resolution of g v there is a short exact sequence 0 g v jg v qg v 0 where jg v is a finite direct sum of functors of the form sd k u v s d k u v by considering the long exact sequences of ext s associated to these short exact sequences we can reduce the proof to showing that ext 1 pk d u k v 1 sd k u v 1 is zero but we can decompose d u k v 1 as a direct sum of functors of the form d 1 k v 1 dk k v 1 with dj d and do the same for sd k u v 1 by the sum diagonal adjunction and the ku nneth formula the vanishing of ext 1 pk d u k v 1 sd k u v 1 will then follow from the vanishing of ext 1 pk e k v 1 se k v 1 for all e d which we will now prove for e pr with r 0 consider the presentation of pr k v 1 as in lemma 4 8 and let k v be the kernel of the corresponding canonical projection pr 1 k v pr k v 1 we have a dimension shifting isomorphism ext 1 pk v 1 v 1 hompk k v pr k v 1 derived functors of the divided power functors 61 whose right hand term embeds into the group hompk pr 1 1 k v v s pr k v 1 which is trivial by sum diagonal adjunction now let e ekp k e 0 be the p adic decomposition of e then the canonical inclusion ek v 1 k i 0 pi k v 1 ei h v 1 admits a rectract provided by the multiplication in the divided power algebra in par ticular ext 1 pk e k v 1 se k v 1 is a direct summand of ext 1 pk h v 1 se k v 1 the latter group is zero by the sum diagonal adjunction proposition a 6 let k be a field of characteristic 2 and let v be a finite dimen sional vector space any extension of degree one in pk between two functors of the form n i 1 di k v ri is trivial proof by iterated use of the sum diagonal adjunction and the ku nneth formula the proof reduces to showing that ext 1 pk f v g v 0 a 8 for f v d k v r and g v e k v s since there are no non trivial extensions between functors with different weights we can assume that d 2 r e 2 s by lemma a 5 precomposition by the frobenius twist induces an isomorphism on the level of ext 1 so the proof reduces to showing a 8 when one of the integers r s is equal to zero if r 0 then a 8 holds by projectivity of f v hence it suffices to prove a 8 for f v d k v r and g v dpr k v with r 0 by sum diagonal adjunction and the ku nneth formula ext pk f v v dpr 0 hence ext 1 pk f v g v hompk f v c v a 9 where c v is the cokernel of the canonical inclusion dpr k v v dp r since c v embeds into 2 k v v p r 2 and dpr k v surjects onto f v the right hand side of a 9 embeds into hompk dpr k v 2 k v v p r 2 the latter group is trivial by a 2 there is a more general statement than proposition a 6 over fields of odd characteristic whose proof is completely similar proposition a 7 let k be a field of odd characteristic p and let v be a finite di mensional k vector space any degree one extension in pk between functors of the form n i 1 di v ri m j 1 ej v sj is trivial remark a 8 proposition a 7 does not hold when k is a field of characteristic p 2 for example ext 1 pk v 1 2 v is one dimensional generated by the extension 0 2 v 2 v v 1 0 where the map 2 v 2 v sends x y to x y and is only well defined if p 2 this non trivial extension shows up in many computations and explains why our results take on different forms depending the parity of the characteristic or of the torsion over z a 3 2 computations in pz the following lemma is a formal consequence of the fact that the functor pfp pz f v 7 f a p is full and faithful lemma a 9 for all f v g v pfp evaluation on a p yields an injective map ext 1 pfp f v g v ext 1 pz f a p g a p derived functors of the divided power functors 62 we cannot expect that evaluation on a 2 induces an isomorphism in general for example by taking the ext long exact sequence associated to the short exact sequence 0 d z a d z a d fp a p 0 we obtain that for all g v pfp d extipz d fp a p g a p g a p if i 0 1 and 0 if i 2 on the other hand by projectivity of d fp v there is no non zero extension of d fp v by g v in pfp we now describe some explicit elementary computations in pz lemma a 10 let p be a prime number then ext 1 pz a p r a p r 0 for all positive integers r proof there is a short exact sequence k pr k 0 kz a z a pr z a a p r 0 where the left hand map is induced by the multiplication let k a be the kernel of the map pr z a a p r applying the functor ext pz a p r to the short exact sequence 0 k a pr z a a p r 0 yields an isomorphism hompz k a a p r ext 1 pz a p r a p r a 10 since k pr k 0 k z a z a surjects onto k a it follows that the left hand side of a 10 embeds into a direct sum of terms hompz k z a z a a p r but these expressions are trivial by lemma a 1 whence the result we now compute the extensions of 2 f 2 a 2 1 by a 2 2 the cokernel of the map 3 z a a 4 z a induced by the multiplication of the divided powers algebra is a homogeneous strict polynomial functor of weight 4 whose image under the forgetful func tor pz fz is the ordinary functor 2 z a 2 we therefore will denote this cokernel by 2 z a 2 1 the following computation is used in proposition 9 4 lemma a 11 there is an isomorphism ext 1 pz 2 f 2 a 2 1 a 2 2 z 2 the non split extension is 0 a 2 2 2 z a 2 1 2 f 2 a 2 1 0 where the maps a 2 2 2 z a 2 1 and 2 z a 2 1 2 f 2 a 2 1 are the unique non zero morphisms between these strict polynomial functors proof consider the commutative diagram 3 z a a 2 z a 2 z a 2 0 3 z a a 3 f 2 a 2 a 2 0 0 4 z a 2 4 z a 4 f 2 a 2 0 0 a 2 2 a 2 z a 2 1 b 2 f 2 a 2 1 0 0 0 0 derived functors of the divided power functors 63 in this diagram the upper vertical arrows are induced by the multiplication in the divided power algebra and the rows and columns are exact the two dashed arrows are produced by the universal property of quotients it is easy to compute that the arrow a is injective when a z hence it is injective for all a by additivity of a 2 2 since the middle row is exact an elementary diagram chase then shows that the bottom row also is we have thus obtained an extension of 2 f 2 a 2 1 by a 2 2 it is non split because the middle term 2 z a 2 1 has 4 torsion we know that hompz a 2 2 a 2 2 z 2 and hompz a 2 2 2 f 2 a 2 1 0 the left exactness of the functor hom therefore implies that the dashed arrow a is the unique non zero morphism from a 2 2 to 2 f 2 a 2 1 to prove that the dashed arrow b is also characterized as the unique non zero morphism available we make use of the fact that 4 a surjects onto 2 z a 2 1 and that there is only one non zero morphism from 4 a to 2 f 2 a 2 1 finally let us compute the group ext 1 pz 2 f 2 a 2 1 a 2 2 this is an f 2 vector space and we will now show that it is of dimension one we already know that its dimension is at least 1 the short exact sequence 0 2 f 2 a 2 1 a 2 2 2 f 2 a 2 1 0 therefore induces an isomorphism z 2 hompz 2 f 2 a 2 1 a 2 2 ext 1 pz 2 f 2 a 2 1 a 2 2 by lemma a 10 the long exact sequence of ext s associated to the short exact sequence 0 2 f 2 a 2 1 2 f 2 a 2 1 a 2 2 0 yields an injective map ext 1 pz 2 f 2 a 2 1 a 2 2 ext 1 pz 2 f 2 a 2 1 a 2 2 it follows that ext 1 pz 2 f 2 a 2 1 a 2 2 has dimension exactly one as asserted the following lemma is used in proposition 9 2 the middle term in the unique non split extension of 2 f 2 a 2 1 by 2 f 2 a 2 a 2 1 which is provided by this computation is the functor which is denoted by 4 a in proposition 7 2 and elsewhere in the text lemma a 12 there is an isomorphism ext 1 pz 2 f 2 a 2 1 2 f 2 a 2 a 2 1 z 2 proof the ext pz a 2 r 1 long exact sequence associated to the short exact sequence 0 2 f 2 a 2 r a 2 r 2 s 2 f 2 a 2 r 0 yields an isomorphism z 2 hompz a 2 r 1 s 2 f 2 a 2 r ext 1 pz a 2 r 1 2 f 2 a 2 r the result of lemma a 12 follows from this assertion and lemma a 10 by using the sum diagonal adjunction and proposition a 2 table 4 collects the results of lemmas a 11 a 12 and some other easy computations obtained with the same techniques some of these computations are used in section 10 a 3 3 examples of computations in fz one can sometimes compute ext 1 groups in fz by methods close to those which we used in pz for example the proof of lemma a 11 carries over without change in fz so that we obtain the following result lemma a 13 there is an isomorphism z 2 ext 1 fz 2 f 2 a 2 1 2 f 2 a 2 a 2 1 the reasoning of the proof of lemma a 11 has to be slightly modified in fz since 2 z a 2 has 4 torsion the forgetful functor pz fz sends the extension 0 a 2 2 2 z a 2 1 2 f 2 a 2 1 0 to a non split extension in fz but the forgetful functor sends a 2 2 to the ordinary func tor a 2 and ext 1 fz a 2 a 2 z 2 the middle term in the non trivial extension being derived functors of the divided power functors 64 ext 1 pz f a g a f a 2 f 2 a 2 1 a 2 1 a 2 1 2 f 2 a 2 a 2 1 2 z a a 2 1 g a a 2 2 z 2 0 0 a 2 1

thus the self extensions of a 2 come into play reasoning as in the proof of lemma a 11 we obtain a short exact sequence of f 2 vector spaces 0 ext 1 fz a 2 a 2 ext 1 fz 2 f 2 a 2 a 2 ext 1 fz 2 f 2 a 2 a 2 0 this leads to the following result lemma a 14 ext 1 fz 2 f 2 a 2 1 a 2 2 z 2 2 appendix b the integral homology of k a n for a free abelian group a in this appendix we translate some the computations of the derived functors of the divided power functors d a achieved in this article in terms of the integral homology of eilenberg mac lane spaces we begin with a short survey on the relation between the functors l d a n and the homology of k a n then we present a table giving a functorial description of the groups hn i k a n z in low degrees b 1 the homology of k a n and the derived functors l a n as proved by dold and puppe 12 satz 4 16 there exist isomorphisms d 0 ljs d a n hj k a n z b 1 however the functoriality in a of such an isomorphism relies on the construction of a moore space m a n it is shown in 35 prop 7 7 that for a free there are non unique morphisms from the complex nsd a n to nz a n which however induce a functorial isomorphism b 1 at the level of homology groups by the de calage isomorphisms 3 5 this reduces the computation of the homology to that of the derived functors of d a for a free for n 1 the functorial isomorphism b 1 can thus be rewritten as the well known isomorphism j a hj k a 1 z while for n 2 one obtains by double de calage the isomorphisms d 0 lj 2 d d a n 2 hj k a n z b 2 derived functors of the divided power functors 65 the situation is more complicated if one considers arbitrary abelian groups b in that case the isomorphism b 1 must be replaced by the second quadrant spectral sequence e 1 p q lp qs p b n hp q k b n z b 3 which by 8 degenerates at e 1 as a result the expressions involving in this context the derived functors of the functors sk b or equivalently by de calage of k b only describe the abutment hp q k b n z up to a filtration since they live in e 1 e d 0 lj 2 d d b n 2 d 0 ljs d b n d 0 gr d hj k b n z b 4 in the stable range that is for the homology groups hi n k b n z with i n the filtration splits indeed in the stable range these homology groups are direct sums of copies of the functors pb the p torsion subgroup of b and b p the mod p reduction of b for prime integers p this follows for example from cartan s computation of the stable homology of eilenberg mac lane spaces 10 exp 11 thm 2 such functors are simple functors hence there cannot be non trivially filtered the filtration is usually not split in non stable degrees this is already visible in the simplest case that of the homology group h 3 k b 1 z in other words the third homology group of the abelian group b in that case the spectral sequence b 3 reduces to the functorial short exact sequence 0 3 b h 3 b l 1 2 b 0 0 b 5 it is shown in 26 cor 3 1 that this exact sequence cannot be functorially split b 2 the homology of k a n in low degrees for a free the table below gives a functorial description of the groups hn i k a n z as a functor of the free abelian group a for all values of the integers n and i such that 1 n 11 and 0 i 10 the convention in lines n 1 to 11 of the table is that each empty box is actually filled with a copy of the expression in the lowest non empty box above it these are therefore all filled with additive groups a p since each of these terms arises by suspension from the one immediately above it every expression on the line adm displays cartan s labelling of the stable groups in the corresponding column in terms of his admissible sequences and its associated prime in the line above this one labelled t is displayed for those admissible word which we called restricted in section 11 1 the corresponding labelling by decreasing sequences of integers mentioned in theorem 11 3 the order in which the items in each box in these two lines are listed reflects the order in which the additive functors to which they correspond occured in the lines above it the table is obtained from our computations of derived functors of divided powers and the functorial isomorphism b 2 indeed since the functors lj 2 d d a n 2 vanish for j 2 d n 2 we need only consider these functors for d 6 the required values the derived functors for d 4 were obtained in sections 8 10 above for d 5 6 it is only necessary to know the values of the derived functors lr d z a n 2 for r 2 the latter can easily be obtained either by a partial analysis of the maximal filtration of d z a for such values of d as provided in example 8 6 for d 4 or by reliance for those values of r on the mod p reduction method described in section 6 this second method reduces the problem to that of a functorial computation of certain derived functors of l d fp v n for an fp vector space v a question which we discussed in section 5 the table shows that the homology groups within the range of values of the pair n i considered can be expressed functorially as direct sums of tensor and exterior powers of the elementary functors a and a p for primes p 5 together with divided power derived functors of the divided power functors 66 functors i z a and 2 z a 2 the only exceptions to this rule are the occurrences of direct summands 2 f 2 a 2 inh 13 k a 3 z andh 15 k a 5 z and of the new functor 4 a inh 11 k a 3 z for which we have provided a number of descriptions in the main body of our text the fact that the primes 2 3 and 5 seem to play a special role here is simply due to our chosen range of values for the variables n and i as these values increase the functors a p will occur for additional primes p while we obtain in this way a complete understanding of the homology of k a n for a free in the range mentioned above we wish to draw the reader s attention to the fact that the situation is more complicated when one no longer restricts oneself to functors on the category of free abelian groups a additional functors of a occur in the general case whose values are torsion groups the simplest of these functors are the additive functors pa kera p a immediately after these one encounters the functors a and r a which eilenberg and mac lane introduced in their foundational text 13 ii 13 22 these would now be denoted l 1 2 a 0 and l 1 2 z a 0 or simply l 1 2 a and l 1 2 z a respectively and they would indeed appear in a table similar to ours for a general a as the derived versions of the functors 2 a and 2 a which are to be found in positions n i 1 1 and n i 2 2 of our table respectively the de calage morphisms imply that for a non free these functors contribute to the groups h k a 1 z and h k a 2 z respectively so that the first two lines of our table below are already much more complicated in that case in this table we can already observe many of the phenomena discussed in the text as we mentioned above the first of these is the lowest occurrence of the periodic phenomenon represented by the functor 4 a which is the only new functor within our range of values the pair of functors 4 z a 2 for the values 4 and 6 of n are also noteworthy as they produce some 4 torsion in the homology finally it will be seen that the two 2 torsion expressions 2 f 2 a 2 while isomorphic actually correspond to two distinct situations indeed they may be thought of in the spirit of conjecture 11 5 as the first derived functors of 2 a 2 and 2 a 2 respectively this is reflected in the different behavior of these two homology groups under suspension while the functor 2 f 2 a 2 which lives in bidegree n i 4 9 suspends to an a 2 in hst 9 k a as one would expect this is not the case for the 2 f 2 a 2 in bidegree 5 10 one verifies by the long exact sequence of 12 korollar 6 11 that the suspension sends this element of h 15 k a 5 z to the summand z a 2 of h 16 k a 6 by the unique non trivial transformation from 2 f 2 a 2 to 2 z a 2 in other words the composite map 2 f 2 a 2 v a 2 f s 2 a 2 2 z a 2 where the maps v and f are the verschiebung and the frobenius maps respectively since the image of this map is decomposable in 2 z a 2 it follows that an additional suspension sends this image to zero in h 17 k a 7 in particular this functor 2 f 2 a 2 does not produce an additional stable summand a 2 in hst 10 a z d e r iv e d f u n c t o r s o f t h e d iv id e d p o w e r
