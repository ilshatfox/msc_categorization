finite type let aut 1 x denote the space of self maps of x homotopic to the identity map the group like space aut 1 x has a classifying space baut 1 x the space baut 1 x appears as the base space of the universal example p ue baut 1 x of a fibration of simply connected cw complexes with fibre of the homotopy type of x 13 2 9 the classifying space baut 1 x offers a computational challenge in homotopy theory when x is a finite complex baut 1 x is of cw type albeit generally infinite and satisfies the localization identity baut 1 xp baut 1 x p for any collection of primes by work of may 9 10 in rational homotopy theory models for baut 1 xq are due to sullivan schlessinger stasheff and tanre 14 12 15 the study of the classifying space using these models is an area of continued activity see e g 8 17 16 we say a space x is finite if x is a simply connected cw complex and dim xq a finite space x has a finitely generated sullivan minimal model v d if x is a finite space then baut 1 xq is one also proposition 2 3 below consequently we may iterate the classifying space construction for finite rational spaces our first result here describes the passage from baut 1 xq to aut 1 baut 1 xq in the setting of derivations of sullivan models we describe this result briefly now with fuller definitions in section 2 the relative sullivan model for the universal fibration p ue baut 1 x with

lie algebra of derivations of v d and write der z z v d for the derivations of z v vanishing on z we will assume derivation spaces are connected thus we restrict der 1 v d to the cycles z 1 der v d and set der n v d 0 for n 0 we do the same for der z z v d define a dg lie algebra map p der z z v d der v d by restricting a derivation to v and composing with the projection p z v v sullivan showed the dg lie algebra der v d gives a model for the classifying space 14 sec 7 see theorem 2 2 below we extend sullivan s result to the following theorem 1 let x be a finite space the map p der z z v d der v d is a quillen model for a ut 1 baut 1 xq baut 1 xq the universal cover of the evaluation map we mention two consequences of theorem 1 first we deduce an interesting feature of the derivations of the relative sullivan model z d z v d for x a finite space corollary 1 1 the dg lie algebra der z z v d satisfies i h der z z v d is an abelian lie algebra ii there are vector space isomorphisms for n 1 hn der z z v d hn 1 der z d we also deduce a formula for the nth gottlieb group of the classifying space baut 1 x recall the subgroup gn y of n y is the image of the map induced on homotopy

gottlieb elements of the clas sifying space proposition 3 1 below more generally we obtain a description of the poset of evaluation subgroups g xq baut 1 xq parameterized by fibrations with fibre xq we give some examples and results on this poset in section 3 complementing work of yamaguchi in 17 we also prove a non realization result for the classifying space theorem 2 there is no simply connected finite space x such that cpnq baut 1 xq for n 2 3 4 theorem 2 extends 7 th 2 for the case n 2 the case n 3 was recently obtained independently in 16 the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we introduce our notation and recall some results on the rational homotopy theory of the space baut 1 x and of the universal fibration with fibre x in rational homotopy theory 3 the monoid aut 1 p of fibrewise self equivalences of a fibration p we prove theorem 1 using these results together with an identity from 1 that connects these spaces section 3 contains our results on the evaluation subgroups of the classifying space we prove theorem 2 in section 4 2 derivations and fibrewise self equivalences may s localization equivalence baut 1 x q baut 1 xq forx finite 10 th 4 1 implies one may study the rationalization of the classifying space using algebraic models with this restriction we are interested here in the space aut 1 baut 1 x we cannot expect to have aut 1 baut 1 xq aut 1 baut 1 x q even for x finite since baut 1 x is generally of infinite cw type thus in what follows we state our main results for rationalized spaces xq for which the various constructions can be made algebraically we establish notation for working in rational homotopy theory our overriding reference for this material is 3 let x be simply connected and and cw complex of finite type a sullivan model for x is a dg algebra v d freely generated by the graded space v with differential d satisfying the nilpotence condition 3 p 138 and such that there is a quasi isomorphism v d apl x with the latter the de rham algebra of rational differential forms on x 3 p 122 a sullivan model for a map f x y is a map of sullivan models making the diagram of quasi isomorphims with apl f apl y apl x commute see 3 ch 23 a sullivan model v d for x is the sullivan minimal model if the differential d is decomposable the homotopy type of xq is completely determined by a sullivan minimal model v d a fibration p e b of simply connected spaces with fibre x has a relative sullivan model which is an inclusion w d w v d of dg algebras in which w d is a sullivan minimal model for the base b the differential satisfies d w d w for w w while d v d v w w v for v v the differential d is not generally decomposable but the dg algebra w v d is a sullivan model for the total space e 3 ch 14 quillen s framework for rational homotopy theory is the category of connected dg lie algebras an object here is a pair l with l n 1 ln equipped with a homogenous bracket and differential lowering degree by one 3 p 383 the commutative cochains functor may be applied to a dg lie algebra l to obtain a sullivan algebra c l sl d d 0 d 3 lem 23 1 here sl is the graded vector space suspension of l d 0 is dual to while d is induced by the bracket in l a dg lie algebra l is a quillen model for x if c l is a sullivan model forx in this case we have an isomorphism x q h l the quillen model for a map f x y is a dg lie algebra map lx ly such that the induced map c c ly y c lx x gives a commutative diagram with quasi isomorphisms to the de rham forms as for sullivan models beginning with a sullivan minimal model v d we obtain the dg lie algebra der v d defined as follows in degree n dern v d consists of linear self maps of v reducing degrees by n v m v m n and satisfying the derivation law 1 2 1 2 1 n 1 1 2 for 1 2 v the bracket of two derivations is defined by the rule 1 2 1 2 1 1 2 2 1 the differential is given by d for der v as we will only consider connected dg lie algebras we restrict in degree 1 to those with 0 to ease notation 4 gregory lupton and samuel bruce smith we write der v d der v for the connected dg lie algebra sullivan s original result on the classifying space is the following theorem 2 1 14 sec 7 let x be simply connected and of finite type with sullivan minimal model v d there is an isomorphism of graded lie algebras baut 1 xq h der v d theorem 2 1 strengthens to the following statement by the work of several au thors theorem 2 2 let x be simply connected and of finite type then der v d is a quillen model for baut 1 xq proof schlessinger stasheff and tanre constructed a quillen model for baut 1 xq written cl lx x see 15 cor 7 4 4 gatsinzi 5 th 1 constructed a quasi isomorphism from der v d to cl l v d where l is the quillen functor from dg algebras to dg lie algebras given a graded vector space v write max v max n v n 6 0 we have proposition 2 3 let x be simply connected and finite then baut 1 xq is finite and we may construct its classifying space baut 1 baut 1 xq further if n max xq then i max baut 1 xq n 1 and ii n 1 baut 1 xq n xq proof parts i and ii are direct consequence of theorem 2 1 cf 8 pro 2 2 we note that if v xq then h der v d is a sub quotient of hom v v and so finite dimensional thus baut 1 xq is finite dimensional by theorem 2 2 let z d denote the sullivan minimal model for c der v d then baut 1 baut 1 xq is the rational space with quillen model der z d finally note that the spatial realization of a finitely generated sullivan model is a cw complex 3 p 247 8 next we consider the monoid of fibrewise equivalences given a fibration p e b set aut 1 p f e e p f f f 1 e map e e let baut 1 p denote the classifying space for this monoid the main result of 1 specialized to universal covers is the following identity theorem 2 4 1 th 4 1 let p e b be a fibration of simply connected cw complexes with fibre x there is a weak homotopy equivalence baut 1 p w m ap b baut 1 x h where the latter space is the universal cover of the function space component of the classifying map h b baut 1 x for the fibration p sullivan s result theorem 2 1 above extends to an identification for the monoid aut 1 p by the main result of 4 we recall this result now given p e b with relative sullivan model w d w v d define der w w v d to be the sub dg lie algebra of der w v d obtained by restricting to derivations with w 0 the differential is the restriction of the differential for der w v d we continue to restrict in degree 1 to the kernel of we have the universal fibration with fibre x in rational homotopy theory 5 theorem 2 5 4 th 4 1 let p e b be a fibration of simply connected cw complexes with fibre x and pq eq bq the rationalization of p there is a natural isomorphism of graded lie algebras in positive degrees aut 1 pq h der w w v d the identification given in theorem 2 5 is natural with respect to maps induced by pull backs of fibrations 17 pro 1 5 a map f b b into the base b of a fibration p e b with fibre x induces a multiplicative map aut 1 p aut 1 p where p is the pull back then f induces the map of derivation spaces f der w w v d der w w v d obtained by composing a derivation with f 1 where f w d w d is a sullivan model of f in particular the inclusion of the base point in b induces the dg algebra map p der w w v d der v d given by p p with p w v v the projection the map p is the subject of theorem 1 which we prove now proof of theorem 1 let x be simply connected finite and of finite type let z d z v d be the relative model for the universal fibration with fibre x recall we are to prove the map p der z z v d der v d is a quillen model for a ut 1 baut 1 xq baut 1 xq since a ut 1 baut 1 xq is an h space a quillen model for this space is just a dg lie algebra with the correct homotopy groups applying theorem 2 4 to the identity map we obtain a weak equivalence a ut 1 baut 1 xq m ap baut 1 xq baut 1 xq 1 w baut 1 p q applying theorem 2 5 we deduce that a ut 1 baut 1 xq h der z z v d as needed finally theorem 2 2 and the naturality of the identification in theorem 2 5 mentioned above gives that p is a quillen model for proof of corollary 1 1 since der z z v d is a quillen model for the h space aut 1 p it has vanishing brackets in homology the isomorphism in corol lary 1 1 ii follows from the chain of isomorphisms hn der z z v d n aut 1 p q n baut 1 p q n 1 aut 1 baut 1 xq hn 1 der z d corollary 1 2 follows directly from theorem 1 and the definition of the gottlieb group we next give a partial description of the differential d in terms of derivations for any relative model w d w v d the minimality condition for d implies for each v v we have d v d v s i 1 wi v wi v where v is 6 gregory lupton and samuel bruce smith in the ideal w w of w v the linear maps wi v v are of degree wi 1 and extend to degree wi 1 cycles of der v d the map wi 7 wi w wi h wi 1 der v d corresponds to the map induced on rational homotopy groups by the classifying map h b baut 1 x 7 th 3 2 for the universal fibration with fibre x the map z h 1 der v d is thus an isomorphism writing h der v d 1 n in a homogeneous basis we conclude there is a corresponding basis z z 1 zn with zi i 1 such that for v v 1 d v d v n i 1 i v zi v for v w w w v we use this description of d in the following simple example illustrating corol lary 1 1 in what follows we write v p for the derivation obtained by sending v v to p v or p z v and vanishing on a complementary subspace of v we write v v 1 note that v p v p example 2 6 let x s 3 cp 2 write the sullivan minimal model for x as x 2 y 3 z 5 d with subscripts indicating degree and differential given by d x d y 0 d z x 3 we see h der v d y x z y y z x z with one non trivial bracket z z y y we then compute c der v d and obtain a minimal model for baut 1 xq of the form z d a b u v w d with a 2 b 3 u v 4 w 6 and d a d b d c d u d v 0 and d w bu using 1 we see that universal fibration has relative sullivan model a b u v w d a b u v w x y z d with

basepoint preserving automorphisms of the classifying space write der z z v d der w w v v w w v with the induced differential corollary 2 7 let x be a finite space then der z z v d is a quillen model for a ut 1 baut 1 xq the universal fibration with fibre x in rational homotopy theory 7 proof the isomorphism of graded lie algebras aut 1 baut 1 xq h der z z v d is a consequence of theorem 1 and the 5 lemma applied to the long exact homotopy sequence of the evaluation fibration aut 1 baut 1 xq aut 1 baut 1 xq baut 1 xq 3 the evaluation subgroups of the classifying space the gottlieb group plays a central role in the theory of fibrations as g x corresponds to the universal image of connecting homomorphisms for fibrations with fibre x 6 th 2 the rational gottlieb groups are the subject of a well known structure theorem in rational homotopy theory for x a finite complex geven xq 0 and dimgodd xq cat xq 3 pro 29 8 the significance of the gottlieb group of the classifying space is less clear we give some examples and results here to suggest the rational gottlieb group and more generally the rational evaluation subgroups of the classifying space offer interesting invariants of the homotopy theory of fibrations we begin with a description of g baut 1 xq in terms of derivations assuming the identification gn baut 1 xq n baut 1 xq hn 1 der v d theorem 3 1 a cycle dern 1 v d represents an element of gn baut 1 xq if and only if extends to a cycle in dern 1 w w v d for every relative model w d w v d proof a fibration pulled back from the universal gives a factorization of monoids of fibrewise equivalences aut 1 p aut 1 p aut 1 x the result now follows from theorems 1 and 2 5 theorem 3 1 roughly implies that the more ample the fibrations with fibre xq the fewer gottlieb elements in h der v d when x is an h space fibrations with fibre x are abundant and we have theorem 3 2 let x be a simply connected finite space with xq an h space then gn baut 1 xq 0 for n n 1 and gn 1 baut 1 xq n xq where n max xq proof the sullivan minimal model for x has trivial differential the differential for der v 0 is trivial as well let dern v 0 be a derivation suppose x 6 0 for some x v n with n n take w to have degree n x 1 and set d v wx with d vanishing on a complementary subspace to v in v for ii we choose an element y v appearing in x we then let w y 1 and set d y z with d vanishing on a complementary subspace to y in v in both cases we see that does not extend to a cycle of der w w v d as needed we note that theorem 3 2 can be proved easily from the various models for baut 1 x we may extend the argument above to give the following 8 gregory lupton and samuel bruce smith theorem 3 3 let x be a finite rational h space and y any finite space suppose max xq max yq then g baut 1 xq yq g baut 1 yq proof write the sullivan minimal model for x as v 0 and y as w d suppose dern v w is a cycle derivation satisfying either i z v v w for some z w or ii x 6 0 for some x v define a relative model of the form w 0 w v w d where the degree of w depends on the case for i we pick v v where v v appears in z extending v v 1 to a basis of v we set d v 1 w and d vi 0 for i 1 with d d on w for ii choose z w of maximal degree and set d z xw d z in either case we see does not extend to to a cycle of der w w v z d at the other extreme from h spaces in terms of admitting fibrations with a given fibre are the f 0 spaces by which we mean finite complexes x which are finite and satisfy hodd x q 0 the halperin conjecture for f 0 spaces asserts that der h x q 0 for all f 0 spaces the conjecture has been affirmed in many cases see 3 prob 1 p 516 theorem 3 4 let x be an f 0 space satisfying der h x q 0 then g baut 1 xq baut 1 xq proof by 11 pro 2 6 baut 1 xq is an h space and so the evaluation map aut 1 baut 1 xq baut 1 xq has a section given by left multiplication we turn to the evaluation subgroups of the classifying space let ef x denote the set of fibre homotopy equivalence classes of fibrations with fibre x the set ef x is partially ordered by the relation induced by pull backs that is we define if is fibre homotopy equivalent to the pullback of fixing a base space b let ef x b denote the sub poset consisting of fibrations over b with fibre x by the classification theory 13 2 9 the assignment h 7 h 1 p induces a natural bijection b baut 1 x ef x b by naturality if b baut 1 x has the partial order corresponding to factorization of maps i e h h if there exists f b b with h h f the above identification is then an isomorphism of posets for any space y the gottlieb group g y is the initial object of a poset under inclusion of subgroups of y called the evaluation subgroups of y let h b y be any map and write map b y h y for the evaluation map for the component of the function space define gn y b h im n map b y h n y n y given maps h b y and h b y we see a factorization h h f for f b b implies the reverse inclusion g y b h g y b h of evaluation subgroups when y baut 1 x the evaluation subgroups are parametrized by equivalence classes of fibrations with fibre x write gn x gn baut 1 x b h n baut 1 x where h b baut 1 x is the classifying map the assignment 7 g x from the poset ef x to the evaluation subgroups of baut 1 x partially ordered by inclusion is order reversing the universal fibration with fibre x in rational homotopy theory 9 in 17 yamaguchi introduced a related poset g x of the gottlieb group g x yamaguchi s groups are recovered with a shift in degrees as images g n x im gn 1 x n x gn x where is the restriction of n aut 1 x n x pre composed with the isomorphism n 1 baut 1 x n aut 1 x we have the identifications theorem 3 5 let x be finite and be a fibration of simply connected spaces with fibre x with relative sullivan model w d w v d then gn 1 q xq im h p hn der w w v d hn der v d g q n xq im h p hn der w w v d hom v n q with p induced by composition with the projection p w v v and by composition with an augmentation v q proof the first result follows from theorem 2 5 and the naturality of this identi fication the second result is 17 th 1 4 we give some examples and results concerning the poset g xq given a set a write p a p a for the power set of partially ordered by inclusion we will make use of the order preserving bijection p 1 n zn 2 where the latter set has the cartesian product partial order example 3 6 let x s 3 s 5 s 7 we show that the poset g xq is isomorphic to the power set p 1 2 3 4 write the sullivan minimal model for x as v d x 3 y 5 z 7 0 with subscripts denoting degrees then h der v 0 der v z y z x x z y y x as our base space we take b baut 1 xq which has sullivan minimal model w d w 1 w 2 w 3 w 4 w 5 w 6 d with w 1 4 w 2 6 w 3 5 w 4 3 w 5 8 w 6 8 with d wi 0 for i 1 4 d w 5 w 3 w 1 and

are both non cycles on the other hand d x 0 implies y and y x are either both non cycles or both are cycles depending on the occurrence or non occurrence of a non zero term wy in d z following yamaguchi 17 def 1 12 define the depth of the poset g x over a base space b written depthb g x to be the number n in the longest proper chain of subgroups g 0 x g n x 10 gregory lupton and samuel bruce smith with each i a fibration over b with fibre x example 3 6 gives depth 4 for g xq over baut 1 xq here is one maximal chain q 1 q 2 q 3 q 4 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 z z z x z z

proof given spaces x and y the product fibration implies the relation depthb g x y depthb g x depthb g y see 17 lem 1 13 in particular depthb g x m q 4 m while depthb g x m q 2 m with x s 3 s 5 s 7 as in example 3 6 and b baut 1 xq changing the degree of just one generator in example 3 6 gives a more compli cated example example 3 8 let x s 3 s 5 s 9 with sullivan model x 3 y 5 z 9 0 then der v z y x z x y x z y z xy we show the full poset of evaluation subgroups g xq is isomorphic to p 9 z 2 where p 9 z 4 2 has hasse diagram p 9 1 1 1 1 rr rr rr rr rr 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 we explain this briefly let w d w v d be a relative sullivan model then z g xq automatically let a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 z 4 2 record the membership status of the derivations y x z x y x in g xq in this order we claim the vectors representing realizable subsets of g xq correspond to p 9 the universal fibration with fibre x in rational homotopy theory 11 suppose a 1 0 a 2 1 so that y is not a cycle and x is one then d z has a term involving y alone which implies y x is a non cycle a 4 0 however z x is unconstrained as z x is a cycle exactly when d x 0 on the other hand when a 1 a 2 0 we can suppose d z has a term xy and neither x nor y appear elsewhere in the image of d such a term does not obstruct y x from being a cycle since x 2 0 then in this case y x and z x are both cycles exactly when d x 0 and so a 3 and a 4 are unconstrained the allowable vectors with a 1 0 are thus 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 when a 1 1 the only constraint is that a 3 a 4 and we obtain the other four vectors in p 9 namely 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 now observe that z y is a cycle precisely when d y 0 the vanishing or non vanishing of d y can be achieved independently of the terms in d that affect the membership of y x z x y x also z xy is a cycle exactly when both z x and z y are cycles it remains to check that all sets described can be realized as g xq for some this is straightforward if laborious in example 3 8 the depth of g xq over the classifying space baut 1 xq can be seen to be 3 while the depth of the full poset of evaluation subgroups is 4 the following result implies the maximal depth of g xq over all base spaces is the depth of the full poset g xq theorem 3 9 let x be a finite space then there exists a base space b such that the depth of g xq over b equals the length of the longest chain in the poset g xq proof let 0 1 n be fibrations with fibre x giving a maximal chain of eval uation subgroups writing pi ei bi for i we set b b 0 bn let i denote the fibration p i ei b given by the composition of pi with the inclusion bi b then we see g i xq g i xq when x is an f 0 space with der h x q 0 the poset g xq is trivial for in this case baut 1 xq is an h space and so the evaluation map map b baut 1 xq hq baut 1 xq has a section it follows that g xq baut 1 xq for all we give an example mixing even and odd spheres example 3 10 let x s 3 s 4 s 6 s 9 we show the poset g xq is isomorphic to z 42 write the minimal model for x as x 3 u 4 t 6 v 7 y 9 z 11 d with subscripts indicating degrees and d u d w d y 0 d v u 2 d z t 2 in this case h der v d z y z x z u v y u y t z xu x y xu z y z ut v t we also have g baut 1 xq z v z u v x thus g q xq contains these cycles for any the inclusion or exclusion of y z y x z x in g xq gives the poset z 42 the status of y x y u y t z xu y xu as regards mem bership in g xq depends on the status of these four precisely y x and y xu are cycles exactly when both y and z x are cycles y u and y t are cycles exactly when y is a cycle and z xu is a cycle exactly when z x is one 12 gregory lupton and samuel bruce smith we conclude this section with an observation regarding the depth of the poset ef xq versus that of the poset of evaluation subgroups proposition 3 11 given any m 0 there exists a finite space x such that depth ef xq depthg q xq m proof letm m 2 and considerx cpm then baut 1 xq is an h space and it is direct to compute that dim baut 1 xq m 1 write baut 1 xq x 1 xm 1 in a basis we may factor the trivial self map of baut 1 xq as a composition h 1 hm 1 such that the m 1 compositions hk h 1 hk for k 1 n are not homotopic we do this by defining hk to be the map with hk xi xi for i 1 k and hk xj 0 for j k we conclude that depth ef xq m while depth g q xq 0 4 a non realization result for the classifying space an open question in rational homotopy theory asks question 4 1 3 p 519 is every simply connected rational homotopy type yq realized as a classifying space in the sense that yq baut 1 xq for some simply connected space x in 8 we proved certain rational homotopy types including cp 2 q could not be realized if x is restricted to be a finite space thus to realize these rational types as a classifying space requires x with infinite dimensional rational homotopy in this section we describe the relative sullivan model of the universal fibration under the assumption that there is a space x with baut 1 xq cp n q proposition 4 2 we apply this description to prove theorem 2 that cpnq cannot be realized as baut 1 xq for any finite x and n 2 3 or 4 write the minimal sullivan model for cpn as u 2 v 2 n 1 d with d v u n 1 suppose first that x is a simply connected space with minimal model v d a fibration x e cpn has relative sullivan model of the form u v d u v v d let v and use the minimality condition for d to write d d u u u 2 u 2 v v vu vu vu 2 vu 2 the maps uk vuk extend to derivations of v of degrees 2 k 1 and 2 n k 5 respectively taking d 2 0 and equating terms with like powers in the generators gives a sequence of relations involving brackets and differentials amongst these derivations in particular we have that u v 0 any set of derivations satisfying these identities gives a rational fibration with fibre xq we have proposition 4 2 suppose there exists a simply connected space x with sullivan model v d such that baut 1 xq cp n q then there exists a relative sullivan model u v d u v v d as above with u der 1 v d and v der 2 n v d non bounding cycles conversely any relative model u v d u v v d with u non bounding is a relative sullivan model for the universal fibration with fibre x and so in this case v is automatically non bounding proof by the description of the differential d given in 1 we see that u and v represent the non trivial classes in cp n q h der v d now sup pose we are given a relative sullivan model u v d u v v d with u not a boundary the corresponding rational fibration has classifying map the universal fibration with fibre x in rational homotopy theory 13 h cpnq baut 1 xq cp n q since u is not a boundary h induces an isomor phism on degree two homotopy groups again by 1 it follows that h is a homotopy equivalence and the given relative sullivan model is fibre homotopy equivalent to that of the universal for the remainder of the paper we suppose x is finite with baut 1 xq cpn q write v d for the sullivan minimal model for x then v 2 n q and v q 0 for q 2 n by proposition 2 3 let u v d u v v d denote the relative sullivan model for the universal fibration with fibre x for degree reasons the only possible non vanishing derivations are u u 2 un v of degrees 1 3 5 2 n 1 and 2 n respectively where the last two are linear maps un v 2 n 1 q and v v 2 n q the identities arising from the equation d 2 0 are as follows 2 u terms u 0 uk terms uk i j k i j i j for k 2 n 1 v terms v 0 proposition 4 2 may be refined in this case to the following lemma 4 3 in the relative sullivan model u v d u v v d the derivation u der 1 v is not a boundary and v 6 0 conversely any col lection u u 2 un v satisfying the identities 2 with u not a boundary is a relative sullivan model for the universal fibration with fibre x consequently v 6 0 we show that altering u by a boundary yields a compatible collection of deriva tions lemma 4 4 let der 2 v there is a relative sullivan model for the uni versal fibration with fibre x with derivations given by u u 2 un v with u u proof since u is a cycle in der 1 v and h der v d is concentrated in de grees 1 and 2 n the derivation cycle 2 u u der 2 v must be a boundary thus we can choose u 2 der 3 v with u 2 2 u u next observe u u 2 is a cycle and so a boundary thus we can find u 3 der 5 v with u 3 u u 2 continuing in this manner we obtain a collection uk for k 1 n satisfying all but the last identity in 2 finally set v i j n i j ui uj by proposition 4 3 these derivations give a relative sullivan model for the universal fibration regarding the differential d we have a quadratic pairing lemma 4 5 let y v 2 n q be nontrivial given a basis z 1 zn for v 2 n 1 there is a corresponding basis x 1 xn for v 2 so that d y x 1 z 1 x 2 z 2 xnzn terms not involving any zj proof the derivations z j in der 2 n 1 v cannot be cycles for it is not possible for these derivations to be boundaries thus each zj must appear in d y and we 14 gregory lupton and samuel bruce smith have a pairing as above if there is some x v 2 not in the span of x 1 xn then y x is a non bounding cycle of degree 2 n 2 a contradiction the quadratic part of d y also has terms involving elements of v 3 and v 2 n 2 lemma 4 6 given w v 3 there is w v 2 n 2 such that ww appears in d y and w does not appear in other terms of d y proof write d w n i 1 qixix i for some x i v 2 define der 2 n 3 v by the formula y w n i 1 qi zi x i we see 0 and so for some der 2 n 2 v then y d y w implies w for some w v 2 n 2 v 4 0 further we must have the term ww with w as specified we apply the preceding to deduce lemma 4 7 in the relative sullivan model for the universal fibration with fibre x we may assume that u y decomposable in v for y v 2 n nontrivial proof suppose u y z for some z v 2 n 1 and decomposable taking z z 1 and extending to a basis we set u u x 1 with x 1 v 2 as in lemma 4 5 then u y is decomposable now apply lemma 4 4 to obtain a compatible collection with u for the relative model of the universal fibration regarding u 2 we have lemma 4 8 if u y is decomposable for y v 2 n nontrivial then u 2 vanishes on v 3 proof suppose w v 3 satisfies u 2 w 1 then d w u 2 u w u d w consider the term ww occurring in d y with w v 2 n 2 from lemma 4 8 this term occurs as a summand of d y applying d again gives a summand u 2 w in d 2 y we claim that this term cannot be cancelled for note for degree reasons uw can only occur in d z for z v 2 n 1 since u y is indecomposable we cannot have a corresponding term uz in d y we apply these results to prove there is no finite x with baut 1 xq cp n q for n 2 3 4 proof of theorem 2 by lemma 4 7 we may assume u v 2 n v v by lemma 4 8 this implies u 2 v 3 0 the formulas for v v 2 n q given in equation 2 for the cases n 2 3 4 are as follows n 2 v u u 2 n 3 v u u 3 2 u 2 u 2 n 4 v u u 4 u 2 u 3 let y v 2 n then u y decomposable implies u un y 0 in each case also u 2 v 3 0 implies u 2 un y 0 thus in all three cases v 0
