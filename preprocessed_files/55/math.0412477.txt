varieties of loop groups cenap o zel abstract in 2 by using fredholm index we developed a version of quillen s geometric cobordism theory for infinite dimensional hilbert manifolds this cobordism theory has a graded group structure under topological union operation and has push forward maps for complex orientable fredholm maps in this work by using quinn s transversality theorem 24 it will be shown that this cobordism theory has a graded ring structure under transversal intersection operation and has pull back maps for smooth maps it will be shown that the thom isomorphism in this theory will be satisfied for finite dimensional vector bundles over separable hilbert manifolds and the projection formula for gysin maps will be proved after we discuss the relation between this theory and classical cobordism we describe some applications to the complex cobordism of flag varieties of loop groups and we do some calculations 1 preliminaries 1 1 complex cobordism complex bordism theory mu was originally defined by geometric means as bordism classes of maps of stably complex manifolds for a space x muq x is the set of equivalence classes of maps m f x where m is a closed stably almost complex manifold it means that m is a compact smooth manifold without boundary of dimension q with tm stably complex two such maps m f and n g are bordant iff their topological union extends to a map w x of a compact stably almost complex manifold w of dimension q 1 whose boundary is the union of m and n here the stably almost structures on m and n induced by the embedding into w and the original ones are required to be equivalent the abelian group structure on mu x is given by the operation of disjoint union in 27 rene thom gave the homotopy theoretic construction of this group the details can be found in 26 the dual cohomology theorymu called complex cobordism was a given a geometric description by d quillen his detailed construction can be found in 23 for a manifold x of dimension n an element in mun q x is represented by a smooth proper map m x of a not necessiraly compact manifold m of dimension q together with an equivalence class of complex orientations two such maps are cobordant iff they are bordant as maps with complex orientations now we recall the basic properties of multiplicative generalized cohomology theories with complex orientation a multiplicative cohomology theory h is a functor from topological spaces to graded rings satisfying the eilenberg steenrod axioms details can be found in 10 and 1 a multiplicative cohomology theory h is complex oriented if the complex vector bundles are oriented for h in a complex oriented cohomology theory the euler class and the chern classes of complex vector bundles are defined and satisfy the usual properties examples of complex oriented cohomolgy theories are ordinary cohomology complex k theory elliptic cohomology and complex cobordism complex cobordism is the universal complex oriented cohomology theory and so for any such theory h we have canonical map mu h a complex orientation of a proper map of smooth manifolds f m n is a factorization m i n where is a complex vector bundle and

compact manifold is said to be complex oriented iff the tangent bundle is stably complex all details about complex cobordism and multiplicative complex oriented generalized cohomology theories can be found in 1 8 10 and 23 1 2 infinite dimensional manifolds and pressley segal stratifications the general reference for the section is 22 lg is the group of all smooth maps from s 1 to compact semi simple lie group g its essential homogeneous spaces are infinite flag manifold lg t and based loop space g where t is a maximal torus of g we are interested to infinite flag manifold lg t the cell complexes and the dual stratifications of lg t are analogically like as g t also we are interested to grassmannians gr h of infinite dimensional complex separable hilbert space h its stratifications can be found in 22 2 the fredholm index and complex cobordism of hilbert manifolds in 23 quillen gave a geometric interpretation of cobordism groups which suggests a way of defining the cobordism of separable hilbert manifolds equipped with suitable structure in order that such a definition be sensible it ought to reduce to his for finite dimensional manifolds and smooth maps of manifolds and be capable of supporting reasonable calculations for important types of infinite dimensional manifolds such as homogeneous spaces of free loop groups of finite dimensional lie groups 2 1 cobordism of separable hilbert manifolds by a manifold we mean a smooth manifold mod elled on a separable hilbert space see lang 15 for details on infinite dimensional manifolds the facts about fredholm map can be found in 7 definition 2 1 suppose that f x y is a proper fredholm map with even index at each point then f is an admissible complex orientable map if there is a smooth factorization f x f q y where q y is a finite dimensional smooth complex vector bundle and f is a smooth embedding endowed with a complex structure on its normal bundle f a complex orientation for a fredholm map f of odd index is defined to be one for the map f x y r given by f x f x 0 for every x x at x x index f x index fx 1 also the finite dimensional complex vector bundle in the smooth factorization will be replaced by r suppose that f is an admissible complex orientable map then since the map f is the fredholm and is a finite dimensional vector bundle we see f is also a fredholm map by the surjectivity of q index f index f dim before we give a notion of equivalence of such factorizations f of f we want to give some definitions definition 2 2 let x y be the smooth separable hilbert manifolds and f x r y a smooth map then we will say that f is an isotopy if it satisfies the following conditions 1 for every t r the map ft given by ft x f x t is an embedding 2 there exist numbers t 0 t 1 such that ft ft 0 for all t 6 t 0 and ft ft 1 for all t t 1 the closed interval t 0 t 1 is called a proper domain for the isotopy we say that two embeddings f x y and g x y are isotopic if there exists an isotopy ft x r y with proper domain t 0 t 1 such that f ft 0 and g ft 1 proposition 2 3 see 15 the relation of isotopy between smooth embeddings is an equivalence rela tion definition 2 4 two factorizations f x f q y and f x f q y are equivalent if and can be embedded as subvector bundles of a vector bundle y such that f and f are isotopic in and this isotopy is compatible with the complex structure on the normal bundle that is there is an isotopy f such that for all t t 0 t 1 ft x is endowed with a complex structure on its normal bundle which matches that of f and f in at t 0 and t 1 respectively by proposition 2 3 we have proposition 2 5 the relation of equivalence of admissible complex orientability of proper fredholm maps between separable hilbert manifolds is an equivalence relation 2 this generalizes quillen s notion of complex orientability for maps of finite dimensional manifolds we can also define a notion of cobordism of admissible complex orientable maps between separable hilbert manifolds first we recall some ideas on the transversality definition 2 6 let f 1 m 1 n f 2 m 2 n be smooth maps between hilbert manifolds then f 1 and f 2 are transverse at y n if df 1 tx 1 m 1 df 2 tx 2 m 2 tyn whenever f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 y the maps f 1 and f 2 are said to be transverse if they are transverse at every point of n lemma 2 7 smooth maps fi mi n i 1 2 are transverse if and only if f 1 f 2 m 1 m 2 n n is transverse to the diagonal map n n n definition 2 8 let f 1 m 1 n f 2 m 2 n be transverse smooth maps between smooth hilbert manifolds the topological pullback m 1 n m 2 x 1 x 2 m 1 m 2 f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 is a submanifold of m 1 m 2 and the diagram m 1 n m 2 f 2 f 1 m 2 yf 1 f 2 yf 2 m 1 f 1 n is commutative where the map fi fj is pull back of fj by fi definition 2 9 let fi xi y i 0 1 be admissible complex oriented maps then f 0 is cobordant to f 1 if there is an admissible complex orientable map h w y r such that the maps i y y r given by i y y i for i 0 1 are transverse to h and the pull back map i h is equivalent to fi the cobordism class of f x y will be denoted by x f proposition 2 10 if f x y is an admissible complex orientable map and g z y a smooth map transverse to f then the pull back map g f z y x z is an admissible complex orientable map with finite dimensional pull back vector bundle g z y z v z g z q v in the factorization of g f where q y is the finite dimensional complex vector bundle in the factorization of f as in definition 2 1 the next result was proved in 19 by essentially the same argument as in the finite dimensional situation using the implicit function theorem 15 theorem 2 11 cobordism is an equivalence relation definition 2 12 for a separable hilbert manifold y ud y is the set of cobordism classes of the admissible complex orientable proper fredholm maps of index d in the above definition instead of proper maps closed maps could be used for infinite dimensional hilbert manifolds because of the following result of smale 25 theorem 2 13 when x and y are infinite dimensional every closed fredholm map x y is proper my next result is the following theorem 2 14 if f x y is an admissible complex orientable fredholm map of index d 1 and g y z is an admissible complex orientable fredholm map of index d 2 then g f x z is an admissible complex orientable fredholm map with index d 1 d 2 3 let g y z be an admissible complex orientable fredholm map of index r by theorem 2 14 we have push forward or gysin map g u d y ud r z given by g x f x g f we show in 19 that it is well defined if g y z is a second map cobordant to g then g g in particular if g and g are homotopic through proper fredholm maps they induce the same gysin maps clearly we have h g h g for admissible complex orientable fredholm maps h g and id id the graded cobordism set u y of the separable hilbert manifold y has a group structure given as follows let x 1 f 1 and x 2 f 2 be cobordism classes then x 1 f 1 x 2 f 2 is the class of the map f 1 f 2 x 1 x 2 y where x 1 x 2 is the topological sum disjoint union of x 1 and x 2 we show in 19 that this sum is well defined as usual the class of the empty set is the zero element of the cobordism set and the negative of x f is itself with the opposite orientation on the normal bundle of the embedding f then we have theorem 2 15 the graded cobordism set u y of the admissible complex orientable maps of y is a graded abelian group now we define relative cobordism definition 2 16 if a is a finite dimensional submanifold of y the relative cobordism set u y a is the set of the admissible complex orientable maps of y whose images lie in y a more generally theorem 2 17 let a be a finite dimensional submanifold of y then the relative cobordism set u y a is a graded abelian group and there is a homomorphism u y a u y by m h y m h y with h m y a if our cobordism functor u of admissible complex orientable fredholm maps is restricted to finite dimensional hilbert manifolds it agrees quillen s complex cobordism functor mu theorem 2 18 for finite dimensional separable hilbert manifolds a y there is a natural isomor phism u y a mu y a 3 transversal approximations contravariance and cup products we would like to define a product structure on the graded cobordism group u y given cobordism classes x 1 f 1 u d 1 y 1 and x 2 f 2 u d 2 y 2 their external product is x 1 f 1 x 2 f 2 x 1 x 2 f 1 f 2 u d 1 d 2 y 1 y 2 although there is the external product in the category of cobordism of separable hilbert manifolds we can not necessarily define an internal product on u y unless y is a finite dimensional manifold however if admissible complex orientable fredholm map f 1 f 2 is transverse to the diagonal imbedding y y y then we do have an internal cup product x 1 f 1 x 2 f 2 x 1 x 2 f 1 f 2 if y is finite dimensional then by thom s transversality theorem in 27 every complex orientable map to y has a transverse approximation hence the cup product induces a graded ring structure on u y the unit element 1 is represented by the identity map y y with index 0 however f quinn 24 proved the generalization of thom s transversality theorem for separable hilbert manifolds using smooth transversal approximations of sard functions in fine topology details about the fine topology jets and smooth maps space cm w n c w n can be found in 16 in this topology the derivatives of the difference function between the function g and its approximation g are bounded we would like to interpret this approximation in the fine topology we need some notation to describe this situation definition 3 1 let x and y be smooth manifolds a k jet from x to y is an equivalence class f x k of pairs f x where f x y is a smooth mapping x x the pairs f x and f x are equivalent if x x f and f have same taylor expansion of order k at x in some pair of coordinate charts centered at x and f x respectively we will write jkf x f x k and call this the k jet of f at x 4 there is an equivalent definition of this equivalence relation f x k f x k if x x and t kx f t kx f where t k is the kth tangent mapping definition 3 2 for a topological space x a covering of x is locally finite if every point has a neigh borhood which intersects only finitely many elements of the covering approximation g of g in the smooth fine topology means the following let li i i be a locally finite cover of w for every open set li there is a bounded continuous map i li 0 such that for every x li and k 0 jkg x jkg x i x definition 3 3 let e be a banach space we say that a collection s of smooth functions e r is a sard class if it satisfies the following conditions 1 for r r y e and s then the function x rx y is also in the class s 2 if n s then the rank of differential dx 1 n is constant for all x not in some closed finite dimensional submanifold of e definition 3 4 let s be a sard class on e uopen in e and m a smooth banach manifold we define s u m to be the collection of sard functions f u m such that for each x u there is a neighbourhood v of x functions 1 n s and a smooth map g w m where w open in r n contains 1 n v all such that f v g 1 n v definition 3 5 the support of a function f x r is the closure of the set of points x such that f x 6 0 from 24 we have theorem 3 6 e admits a sard class s if s e r contains a function with bounded nonempty support in particular the separable hilbert space admits sard classes definition 3 7 a refinement of a covering of x is a second covering each element of which is contained in an element of the first covering definition 3 8 a topological space is paracompact if it is hausdorff and every open covering has a locally finite open refirement definition 3 9 a smooth partition of unity on a manifold x consists of an covering ui of x and a system of smooth functions i x r satisfying the following conditions 1 x x we have i x 0 2 the support of i is contained in ui 3 the covering is locally finite 4 for each point x x we have i i x 1 definition 3 10 a manifold x will be said to admit partitions of unity if it is paracompact and if given a locally finite open covering ui there exists a partition of unity i such that the support of i is contained in some ui from 15 we have theorem 3 11 let x be a paracompact smooth manifold modelled on a separable hilbert space h then x admits smooth partitions of unity from 12 theorem 3 12 on a separable hilbert manifold the functions constructed using the partitions of unity form a sard class the following result was proved by f quinn theorem 3 13 let h be the smooth separable hilbert space and let u be an open set in h if f w n is a smooth proper fredholm map then smooth maps transversal to f are dense in s u n with the c 0 fine topology 5 we will require the open embedding theorem of eells elworthy 11 theorem 3 14 let m be a smooth manifold modelled on the separable infinite dimensional hilbert space h then m is diffeomorphic to an open subset of h theorem 3 15 the space s u n is dense in c 0 u n in the c 0 fine topology using these techniques quinn proves the following result corollary 3 16 let m be a smooth separable hilbert manifold if f w n is a smooth proper fredholm map then smooth maps transversal to f are dense in c 0 m n in the c 0 fine topology from 11 we have theorem 3 17 let x and y be two smooth manifold modelled on the separable infinite dimensional hilbert space h if there is a homotopy equivalence x y then is homotopic to a diffeomorphism now i will try to tell a detailed explanation of quinn s very technical work in theorem 3 13 let f w n be a smooth proper fredholm map and let g s u n specified in theorem 3 13 now we are given an arbitrary c 0 fine neighborhood of g in which we want to find a map transversal to f since some neighborhood of the image of g is metrizable we can impose a metric on it and then we can choose a function u 0 1 so that the neighborhood of g in s u n lies in the given c 0 fine neighborhood now we explain the smale decomposition of the smooth proper fredholm map f w n if x n then there is a coordinate neighborhood u h rk about x such that f 1 u k n i 1 vi k f 1 1 h dk for some sets vi such that i vi h wi wi open in r m and f 1 i fi h wi h r k where dk is the open unit ball in rk using separability of u we cover g u by n f w and a countable number of sets of the form 1 i hi d ki where i ui hi r ki are coordinate neighborhoods as given in the smale decom position of f we denote the corresponding coordinate neighborhoods in the domain by vij ij where ij vij hi wi wi open in r mi let yi be a locally finite refinement of g 1 1 i hi d ki g 1 n f w and let zi be a subcover such that yi k zi inductively we will get an approximation of g let g 0 g given gi let gi 1 be the approximation defined by quinn applied the situation u 1 u 2 yi u 3 zi w the disjoint union of of the wij over j and the c 0 fine topology neighborhood so small that gi 1 gi 2 i 1 yi and gi 1 yi 1 i hi d ki where yi s ki since yi is locally finite g lim i gi is well defined g is an approximation of g and g s u n and it is transverse to f everywhere it is interesting that this approximation can be done in the cr fine topology for separable hilbert manifolds it can be even done in the smooth c fine topology in this case g s u n theorem 3 18 let u be an open set in separable infinite dimensional hilbert space h and let f m n be a proper fredholm map between separable infinite dimensional hilbert manifolds m and n then the set of maps transverse to f is dense in the closure of sard function space s u n in the c fine topology by corollary 3 16 a smooth map even continuous map g z y can be deformed to a smooth map g z y by a small correction until it is transverse to an admissible complex orientable map f x y it is obvious that they are homotopic each other by definition of cobordism and proposition 2 10 the cobordism functor is contravariant for any smooth map between separable hilbert manifolds theorem 3 19 let f x y be an admissible complex oriented map and let g z y be a smooth may be continuous map then the cobordism class of the pull back z y x z depends only on the cobordism class of f hence there is a map g ud y ud z given by g x f g x f z y x g f where g is a smooth approximation of g which is transverse to f moreover g depends only on the homotopy class of g now we give the functorial property of u theory 6 theorem 3 20 let x y and z be separable hilbert manifolds if z y x are smooth functions then ud x ud z the identity map id x x induces the identity endomorphism id ud x ud x for every d proof after making them transverse where appropriate we consider the following commutative diagram m m m yf yf yf z y x where both squares are pullback diagrams with transverse f and f the outer square is then also pullback with transverse f given an admissible complex oriented map f m x we show that the mapsm f y andm f z are admissible complex orientable and m f x m f x it is clear thatm z y m z y y x m as well as z x m so that m f x m f x by the following commutative diagram m m m yf yf yf yq yq yq z y x where the finite dimensional vector bundle z y z y y x as well as z x let turn back the interior cup products in u given cobordism classes x 1 f 1 u d 1 y 1 and x 2 f 2 u d 2 y 2 their external product is x 1 f 1 x 2 f 2 x 1 x 2 f 1 f 2 u d 1 d 2 y 1 y 2 if admissible complex orientable fredholm map f 1 f 2 is transverse to the diagonal imbedding y y y then we do have an internal cup product x 1 f 1 x 2 f 2 x 1 x 2 f 1 f 2 if the diagonal imbedding y y y is not transverse to smooth proper fredholm map f 1 f 2 x 1 x 2 by quinn s transversality theorem we can find a smooth approximation of which is transverse to f 1 f 2 then theorem 3 21 if x 1 f 1 u d 1 y 1 and x 2 f 2 u d 2 y 2 internal cup product x 1 f 1 x 2 f 2 x 1 x 2 f 1 f 2 x 1 x 2 f 1 f 2 u d 1 d 2 y where is a smooth approximation of which is transverse to f 1 f 2 the cup product is well defined and associative then u is a multiplicative contravariant functor for smooth functions on the separable hilbert manifolds the question of whether it agrees with other cobordism functors such as representable cobor dism seems not so easily answered and there is also no obvious dual bordism functor in this section we show how to define euler classes in complex cobordism for finite dimensional complex vector bundles over separable hilbert manifolds in order to do this we use sard classes we know from 13 that global sections of a vector bundle on a smooth separable hilbert manifold can be constructed using partitions of unity then all sections are sard given a smooth vector bundle e b over a separable hilbert manifold b we know from theorem 3 14 that b can be embedded as a open subset of a separable hilbert space h by theorem 3 18 we have corollary 3 22 let e b be a finite dimensional complex vector bundle over a separable hilbert manifold b and let i b e be the zero section then there is an approximation i of i with i transverse to i 7 then we define the euler class of a finite dimensional complex vector bundle on a separable hilbert manifold note that theorem 3 19 implies that this euler class is a well defined invariant of the bundle definition 3 23 let b be a finite dimensional complex vector bundle of dimension d on a separable hilbert manifold b with zero section i b the u theory euler class of is the element i i 1 u 2 d b we have the following projection formula for the gysin map theorem 3 24 let f x y be an admissible complex orientable map and let y be a finite dimensional smooth complex vector bundle of dimension d then x f f f proof let s be a smooth section of transverse to the zero section i y then y y y s y i y is a submanifold of complex codimension d and y j where j y y is the inclusion setting x f 1 y x x s f x i f x which is also a submanifold of x of complex codimension d we have x f y j x f x f x now we determine f f e by transversality theorem f can be deformed to a smooth map f such that the composite section s f x f is transverse to the zero section and they agree on x hence by definition we have f x j where j x x is the inclusion hence f f x f x by definition of the gysin map f now we need a useful lemma from 24 lemma 3 25 a smooth split submanifold of a smooth separable hilbert manifold has a smooth tubular neighborhood let x be a finite dimensional complex vector bundle of dimension d on a separable hilbert manifold x with zero section i x the map i is proper so that we have the gysin map i u j x uj 2 d u where u is a smooth neighborhood of the zero section the map is not proper however if u is contained in a tube u r of finite radius r then u is proper and we can define u j 2 d u uj x since i id we have i id the composite map i is homotopic to id if u u is itself a tube the homotopy moves on u and we have thom isomorphism uj 2 d u uj x 4 the relationship between u theory and mu theory in this section we consider the relationship between u theory and mu theory later we discuss the particular cases of grassmannians and lg t first we discuss the general relationship between u and mu let x be a separable hilbert manifold for each proper smooth map f m x where m is a finite dimensional manifold there is a pullback homomorphism f u x u m mu m if we consider all such maps into x then there is a unique homomorphism u x lim m x mu m 8 where the limit is taken over all proper smooth maps m x from finite dimensional manifolds which form a directed system along commuting diagrams of the form m 1 f m 2 y y x x and hence give rise to an inverse system along induced maps f mu m 2 mu m 1 in cobordism let x be a separable hilbert manifold each of the following conjectures appears reasonable and is consistent with examples we will discuss later we might also hope that surjectivity could be replaced by isomorphism but we do not have any examples supporting this conjecture 1 is always a surjection conjecture 2 if uev x 0 or uodd x 0 is a surjection conjecture 3 if mu ev x 0 or muodd x 0 is a surjection now we discuss some important special cases let h be a separable complex hilbert space with hn n 1 an increasing sequence of finite dimensional subspaces with dimhn n with h n 1 hn dense in h we use a theorem of kuiper 14 theorem 4 1 the unitary group u h of a separable hilbert space h is contractible let grn h be the space of all n dimensional subspaces of h which is a separable hilbert manifold then grn h k n grn h k is a dense subspace of grn h which we will take it to be a model for the classifying space bu n theorem 4 2 the natural embedding grn h grn h is a homotopy equivalence and the natural n plane bundle n grn h is universal proof by a theorem of pressley and segal 22 the unitary group u h acts on gr h transitively and hence u h acts on grn h transitively let h n be an n dimensional subspace of infinite dimensional separable hilbert space h and let h be the orthogonal complement of hn in h the stabilizer group of hn is u hn u h which acts freely on the contractible space u h hence grn h u h u h n u h b u hn u h bu hn bu h by kuiper s theorem 4 1 u h is contractible hence so is bu h hence grn h bu h n bu n on the other hand grn h k n u hk u hn u h grn h where h is the orthogonal complement of hn in hk by the construction the natural n plane bundle n grn h is universal also the natural bundle n grn h is classified by the inclusion grn h grn h and since the latter is universal this inclusion is a homotopy equivalence in particular the inclusion of the projective space p h n 1 p hn p h is a homotopy equivalence theorem 4 3 the natural homomorphism u p h lim n mu p hn mu p h is surjective 9 proof we will show by induction that u p h i n mu p hn 1 is surjective for each n it will suffice to show that xi im i n for i 0 n for n 0 this is trivial now we verify it for n 1 by theorem 4 2 since the natural line bundle p h p h is universal the following diagram commutes for each n 1 n i n i n yi n y cpn p hn 1 in p h where in cp n p hn 1 p h is the inclusion map by the compatibility of induced bundles for n 1 and the generator x n mu p hn 1 there exists an euler class x u 2 p h satisfying i n x x where in p h n 1 p h is the inclusion map assume that i n is surjective then there are elements yi u 2 i p h i 0 n such that i nyi x i mu 2 i p hn 1 also i n 1 yi x i zix n 1 mu 2 i p hn 2 where zi mu 2 n 1 i in particular let yn w f u 2 n p h then the following diagram commutes f f y y w f p h and there is an euler class f w g u 2 w now by theorem 3 24 yn 1 f f u 2 n 2 p h satisfies i n 1 yn 1 x n n x n 1 hence im i n 1 contains the mu submodule generated by xi i 0 n and so i n 1 is surjective this completes the induction this shows that the induced homomorphism u p h lim n mu p hn mu p h is surjective note that it is also possible to prove this result by using the projective spaces p hn p h to realize cobordism classes restricting to the classes xn in mu p h next we discuss some geometry of grassmannians from pressley segal 22 whose ideas and notation we assume we take for our separable hilbert space h l 2 s 1 c and let h to be the closure of the subspace of h containing the functions zn z zn n 0 then gr 0 h lim k 1 gr h k k where gr h k k is the grassmannian of the finite dimensional vector space h k k z kh z kh gr 0 h is dense in gr h and is also known to be homotopic to the classifying space of k theory bu z theorem 4 4 for n 1 the natural homomorphism u grn h mu grn h is surjective 10 proof for k n the inclusion i grn h k k grn h induces a contravariant map u grn h u grn h k k mu grn h k k for k n since cs grn h k k is transverse to s there exists a stratum s such that s k grn h k k s grn h k k mu grn h k k are the classical schubert cells by an argument using the atiyah hirzebruch spectral sequence and results on schubert cells in cohomology 17 the cobordism classes s k provide generators for the mu module mu grn h k k then i is surjective for each k muodd grn h k k 0 hence u grn h lim k mu grn h k k mu grn h mu grn h is surjective theorem 4 5 for a compact connected semi simple lie group g u lg t mu lg t is surjective proof as lg t has no odd dimensional cells the atiyah hirzebruch spectral sequence formu lg t collapses hence it suffices to show that the composition u lg t mu lg t h lg t z is surjective since h lg t z is generated by the schubert classes w w w dual to the schubert cells cw and w is dual to cw the image of the stratum w under the composition map gives w establishing the desired surjectivity similarly we have theorem 4 6 for a compact connected semi simple lie group g u g mu g is surjective 5 cobordism classes related to pressley segal stratifications and some calculations in this section we show that the stratifications introduced by pressley segal 22 give rise some further interesting cobordism classes in u lg t the grassmannian grh of 22 is a separable hilbert manifold and the stratum s grh is a locally closed contractible complex submanifold of codimension s and the inclusion map s gr h is a proper fredholm map with index s therefore we have theorem 5 1 the stratum s gr h represents a class in u 2 s gr h these strata s are dual to the schubert cells cs in the following sense 1 the dimension of cs is the codimension of s and 2 cs meets s transversely in a single point and meets no other stratum the same codimension the loop group lg acts via the adjoint representation on the hilbert space hg l 2 s 1 gc where gc is the complexified lie algebra of g if dimg n we can identify hg with h n and since the adjoint representation is unitary for a suitable hermitian inner product this identifies lg with a subgroup of lu n then 22 shows how to identify the based loop group g with a submanifold of u n which can be itself identified with a submanifold of gr hg then g inherits a stratification with strata indexed by homomorphisms t t each stratum g is a locally closed contractible complex submanifold of codimension d and the inclusion map g is an admissible fredholm map then 11 theorem 5 2 for each the inclusion g represents a class in u 2 d g if we restrict to the inverse limitmu g these stratum provide the basis elements ofmu 2 d g since h g is even graded and mu is also even graded the atiyah hirzebruch spectral sequence h g mu mu g collapses hence we have an isomorphism u g ker mu g h g mu for g su 2 we have u su 2 ker mu su 2 z mu where z is a divided power algebra with the z module basis n in each degree 2 n for n 1 such stratifications also exist for the homogeneous space lg t theorem 5 3 for w w the inclusion w lg t represents a class in u 2 w lg t similarly if we restrict to the inverse limit mu lg t we have an isomorphism u lg t ker mu lg t h lg t mu for g su 2 we have u lsu 2 t ker mu lsu 2 t z x 0 x 1 iz mu where the ideal iz is given by iz x n 0 x m 1 n m 1 m x n m 0 n m 1 n x n
