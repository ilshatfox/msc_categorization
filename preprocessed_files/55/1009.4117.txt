introduction let x be a noetherian separated scheme of finite krull dimension and mx be the category of pointed simplicial presheaves in the smooth nisnevich site smx over x equipped with the quillen model structure 16 introduced by morel voevodsky 7 we define t in mx as the pointed simplicial presheaf represented by s 1 gm where gm is the multiplicative group a 1 x 0 pointed by 1 and s 1 denotes the simplicial circle let spt mx denote the category of symmetric t spectra on mx equipped with jardine s motivic model structure 4 the homotopy category of spt mx is a triangulated category which will be denoted by sh given an integer q z we consider the following family of symmetric t spectra c q eff fn s r gsm u n r s 0 s n q u smx where fn is the left adjoint to the n evaluation functor evn spt mx mx voevodsky 24 defines the slice filtration as the following family of triangulated subcategories of sh q 1 t sh eff q tsh eff q 1 t sh eff where q tsh eff is the smallest full triangulated subcategory of sh which contains c q eff and is closed under arbitrary coproducts it follows from the work of neeman 8 9 that the inclusion iq q tsh eff sh has a right adjoint rq sh q tsh eff and that the following functors fq sh sh sq sh sh are triangulated where fq is defined as the composition iq rq and sq is character ized by the fact that for every e spt mx we have the following distinguished triangle in sh fq 1 e e q fqe e q sqe 1 0 t fq 1 e we will refer to fqe as the q 1 connective cover of e and to sqe as the q slice of e it follows directly from the construction that the q slice of e is right orthogonal with respect to q 1 t sh eff i e homsh k sqe 0 for every k in q 1 t sh eff on the orientability of the slice filtration 3 2 strict mgl modules in this section we will show that all the slices have a canonical structure of strict modules in spt mx over voevodsky s algebraic cobordism spectrum let a be a cofibrant ring spectrum with unit in spt mx and a mod be the category of left a modules in spt mx the work of jardine 4 proposition 4 19 and hovey 3 corollary 2 2 implies that the adjunction a u spt mx a mod induces a quillen model structure spta mx in a mod this means that a map f m n in spta mx is a weak equivalence or a fibration if and only if uf is a weak equivalence or a fibration in spt mx it is easy to see that the homotopy category sha of spta mx is a triangulated category 13 proposition 3 5 3 definition 2 1 let e be a spectrum in sh we say that e is effective if e belongs to the triangulated category 0 tsh eff defined above theorem 2 2 let a be an effective cofibrant ring spectrum with unit ua 1 a in spt mx if s 0 u a is an isomorphism in sh then for every q z the functor sq sh sh factors up to a canonical isomorphism through sha sh sq s q f f f f sh sha ur a oo where ra denotes a fibrant replacement functor in spta mx proof this follows directly from 13 theorem 3 6 20 and lemma 3 6 21 or 11 theorem 2 1 vi the following proposition was proved by voevodsky 24 p 10 section 3 4 and spitzweck 19 corollaries 3 2 and 3 3 proposition 2 3 voevodsky let mgl denote voevodsky s algebraic cobordism spectrum 23 we have that mgl is effective and its unit map umgl 1 mgl induces an isomorphism on the zero slices in sh s 0 u mgl s 01 s 0 mgl now we can state the main result of this section theorem 2 4 let q z denote an arbitrary integer and e denote an arbitrary symmetric t spectrum in spt mx we have that the q slice sqe of e is equipped with a canonical structure of mgl module in spt mx this implies that over any base scheme the slices are always oriented cohomology theories in the sense of de glise 2 example 2 12 2 proof this follows immediately from theorem 2 2 and proposition 2 3 4 pablo pelaez remark 2 5 one of the interesting consequences of theorem 2 4 is the fact that over any noetherian separated base scheme of finite krull dimension once we pass to the slices it is possible to apply all the formalism developed by de glise in 2 e g chern classes and the gysin triangle on the orientability of the slice filtration 5 3 oriented ring spectra and formal group laws in this section we will show that given a commutative ring spectrum e in sh its zero slice s 0 e is an oriented ring spectrum in the sense of morel 21 definition 3 1 with additive formal group law in sh to simplify the notation we will denote by pn the trivial projective bundle of rank n over our base scheme x definition 3 1 let e be a commutative ring spectrum in sh with unit u e 1 e we say that e is an oriented ring spectrum if there exists an element xe in homsh f 0 p s 1 gm e where p is the colimit of the diagram p 1 p 2 pn given by the inclusions of the respective hyperplanes at infinity such that xe pulls back to the following composition f 0 p 1 f 0 s 1 gm id u e f 0 s 1 gm e s 1 gm e the following proposition is classical proposition 3 2 cf 14 15 21 let e xe be an oriented ring spectrum in sh and let m p p p be the map induced by the corresponding segre embeddings the pullback of xe along m is a formal group law fe fe i j 1 cijx i y j where the coefficients cij are elements in the abelian group homsh f 0 s i j 1 gi j 1 m e and x resp y is the pullback of xe along the projection in the first factor p 1 p p p resp second factor lemma 3 3 let e be a commutative ring spectrum in sh with unit ue 1 e then its zero slice s 0 e is also a commutative ring spectrum in sh and the induced map s 0 u e s 01 s 0 e is a map of ring spectra in sh proof the fact that s 0 e is a ring spectrum in sh follows from 13 theorem 3 6 13 on the other hand the naturality of the pairings constructed in 13 theorem 3 6 9 implies that s 0 e is also commutative in sh and that s 0 u e is a map of ring spectra in sh lemma 3 4 the natural map mgl 0 mgl f 0 mgl s 0 mgl is a map of ring spectra in sh proof by proposition 2 3 we have that mgl is naturally isomorphic to f 0 mgl in sh on the other hand theorem 3 6 10 3 in 13 implies that mgl 0 is a map of ring spectra in sh 6 pablo pelaez theorem 3 5 let e be a commutative ring spectrum in sh then its zero slice s 0 e is an oriented ring spectrum in the sense of morel and it is equipped with a canonical orientation given by the following composition mgl mgl 0 s 0 mgl s 0 u mgl 1 s 01 s 0 u e s 0 e furthermore the associated formal group law fs 0 e of s 0 e is additive proof the universality of mgl cf 21 theorem 4 3 10 theorem 2 7 and 20 proposition a 2 implies that in order to show that the map defined above gives an orientation for s 0 e it is enough to see that all the maps are in fact maps of ring spectra in sh but this follows directly from proposition 2 3 together with lemmas 3 3 and 3 4 on the other hand the formal group law of s 0 e fs 0 e i j 1 cijx iyj has coefficients cij which by construction are in the abelian group homsh f 0 s i j 1 gi j 1 m s 0 e however if i j 1 then f 0 s i j 1 gi j 1 m is automatically in 1 tsh eff hence homsh f 0 s i j 1 gi j 1 m s 0 e 0 since s 0 e is right orthogonal with respect to 1 tsh eff therefore the formal group law of s 0 e fs 0 e i j 1 cijx iyj x y is additive as we wanted on the orientability of the slice filtration 7 4 applications in this section we will show that with rational coefficients all the slices sq e 1 q are in a natural way motives in the sense of cisinski de glise 1 as a consequence we will get that over an excellent base scheme the presheaves of rational rigid homotopy groups have transfers this proves a conjecture of voevodsky 24 conjecture 11 4 1 slices and the cisinski de glise category of motives let hb x kgl 0 x spt mx denote the beilinson motivic cohomology spectrum constructed by riou in 17 the work of cisinski de glise shows in particular that hb x is a commutative cofi brant ring spectrum in spt mx cf 1 corollary 13 2 6 and that the homotopy category of hb x modules sh hb x is naturally equivalent to the cisinski de glise category of motives dmb x cf 1 theorem 13 2 9 theorem 4 1 if we consider rational coefficients the zero slice of the sphere spec trum s 0 1 1 q is equipped with a unique structure of hb x algebra in spt mx in particular there exists a unique map s 0 1 1 q of ring spectra in sh such that the following diagram is commutative mgl 1 q mgl 0 id h s 0 mgl 1 q s 0 u mgl 1 id s 0 1 1 q hb x s 0 1 1 q 11 d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d proof by theorem 3 5 we have that s 0 1 is orientable therefore the result follows directly from corollary 13 2 15 ri rii riii in 1 theorem 4 2 let q z denote an arbitrary integer and e denote an arbitrary symmetric t spectrum in spt mx we have that the q slice of e with rational coefficients sq e 1 q is equipped with a canonical structure of hb x module in spt mx this implies that over any base scheme the slices with rational coeffi cients sq e 1 q are motives in the sense of cisinski de glise proof using corollary 13 2 15 i iv v in 1 we get that it is enough to show that sq e 1 q is a hb x module in sh on the other hand by theorem 4 1 we just need to check that sq e 1 q is a s 0 1 1 q module in sh finally this follows directly from theorem 3 6 14 6 in 13 4 2 rational rigid homotopy groups given a symmetric t spectrum e in spt mx voevodsky defines the presheaves of rigid homotopy groups rig p q e on smx as follows rigp q e smx abelian groups u homsh f 0 s p gqm u sqe conjecture 11 in 24 claims that these presheaves have transfers theorem 4 3 let p q z denote arbitrary integers and e denote an arbitrary symmetric t spectrum in spt mx furthermore assume that the base scheme 8 pablo pelaez x is excellent then the presheaves of rigid homotopy groups of e with rational coefficients rigp q e q have transfers proof clearly it suffices to show that sq e 1 q has transfers now theorem 4 2 implies that sq e 1 q is in dmb x since we are assuming that x is excellent theorem 15 1 2 in 1 implies that dmb x is naturally equivalent to the category of motives dmqfh x constructed using qfh sheaves with rational coefficients thus the result follows from theorem 3 3 8 in 22 see also proposition 9 5 5 in 1 which implies than every qfh sheaf is canonically equipped with transfers remark 4 4 theorem 4 3 was proved using the functoriality of the slice filtration in 12 theorem 4 4 for schemes defined over a field of characteristic zero on the other hand if the base scheme x is smooth over a perfect field k then theorem 4 3 holds even with integral coefficients cf 13 theorem 3 6 22 both proofs rely on the computation of levine 5 and voevodsky 25 for the zero slice of the sphere spectrum as well as on the work of ro ndigs stv r 18 the analogue of this question for the category of s 1 spectra is studied by levine in 6 on the orientability of the slice filtration 9 acknowledgements the
