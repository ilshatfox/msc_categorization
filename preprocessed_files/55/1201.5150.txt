manifold m of dimension n hp m and hcn p m are always isomorphic this fact is called poincare duality there are two ways to define an actual isomorphism between the two the first one involving dual cellulation is more visual and appeared earlier in history it is defined in section 2 the second more modern since directly defined in the context of singular co homology has the drawback of being manipulated only in algebraic terms as a result the reason why it does work is not transparent from a geometric point of view see section 3 another link between cohomology and homology in dimension 2 is to associate to each 1 cocycle some level curve this process is explained in section 4 our goal is both to connect these three notions and to provide a natural visualization of them we will do that in the remaining sections 2 2 dual cellulation and duality we are going to consider only the restricted case where m is a compact orientable tri angulated manifold of dimension n and finite triangulation the co homology we are considering is the simplicial one with coefficients in z orientability here means that there is a way of assigning a sign 1 to each n simplex of in such a way that the sum of all such signed simplices is a n cycle see 1 for instance the homology class of such a n cycle generates the nth homology group and is called a fundamental class for m we are going to consider first the dual cellulation defined on each n simplex let t v 0 vn be a n simplex of and let s vi 0 vik be some k face of t where as usual i 1 ik the dual cell associated to s in t is the convex hull of all barycenters of subsets of vertices of t that contain the vertices of s it is part of the barycentric subdivision of and therefore inherit a canonical orientation we will choose the convention that any p face of the barycentric subdivision of is written b 1 bp where every bj is the barycenter of some set of vertices containing less elements that the set of vertices for bj 1 see 2 where the orientation convention is reversed from ours for details about barycentric subdivision for n 3 we get the following picture where orientation is omitted the dual cell associated to a 2 face of t is the edge connecting the center of t to the center of that face in red in the picture the dual cell associated to an edge of t is the dimension 2 convex hull of the center of t the center of this edge and the center of the two 2 faces containing this edge in yellow in the picture the dual cell of t is its center and the dual of this center is t itself now choose some k cochain of m we associate to it the n k chain d 1 consisting of the sum of the dual of every k simplex s counted s times more precisely and taking orientation into account for every n simplex t and every of 3 its k face s write s t the dual of s in t then for every k chain d 1 t a n simplex of s a k face of t 1 t 2 s t s s t where 1 t is the sign of t in some fundamental class of m and 2 s t is the sign of s in n kt we leave to the reader to see why these signs give consistent orientations of dual cells when we glue every contiguous n simplices together in dimension 2 here are the different orientations involved figure 1 the standard 2 simplex with from left to right the standard orientation the orientation of the dual 1 cells and the same cells with coefficient 2 vi vj to finish this section here are two examples of 1 cochains first column and their image under d 1 second column 4 3 cap product and duality in the same setting as before namely for m a compact orientable triangulated manifold of dimension n and triangulation consider the cap product ck cn cn k defined by v 0 vn 7 v 0 vk vk vn where as usual cp ker is the space of p cocycles and cp ker is the space of p cycles now define d 2 c k cn k to be the linear map d 27 m where m is a fundamental class for m in other words d 2 assigns up to sign to each cocycle ck and every n simplex t v 0 vn the last n k face of t with multiplicity the value of on the first k face here are two examples in dimension 2 of 1 cochains first column and their image under d 2 second column note that what d 2 does to every n simplex is clear since it forgets every face except the last and takes it with multiplicity the image of the first face under less clear is why that works i e why we obtain an isomorphism indeed this process seem to forget a lot of information relative to as we see in the previous picture the proof that d 2 is an isomorphism is usually done by using the bootstrap technique see 2 we will attempt to give a more visual reason for that in section 7 another natural question to ask is if d 1 defined in section 2 and d 2 do the same work it seems not when comparing the respective images of the same cocycles see section 2 this matter will be elucidated in section 5 for n 2 and section 6 for the general case 5 4 construction of level curves in dimension 2 there is a nice way of seeing what a 1 cochain must verify to be a cocycle namely a 1 cochain is a cocycle if and only if the following holds for every simplex triangle v 0 v 1 v 2 v 0 v 2 v 0 v 1 v 1 v 2 interpreting every vi vj as a difference of elevation we see that this formula guarantees that we get to the same elevation by going directly from v 0 to v 2 or by going first from v 0 to v 1 and then from v 1 to v 2 thus we can construct locally by that we mean on restriction to any triangle altitudes that are consistent with as in the following figure figure 2 a cocycle represented in red represents a difference of elevation leading to altitudes on the vertices of the triangle in black we would like to construct level curves for these local altitude so that each triangle looks like a topographic map that means that we are going to draw on the surface a system of distinct oriented loops each corresponding to a constant elevation in our analogy in such a way that the intersection number between the system of loops and each edge vi vj is exactly vi vj figure 3 traveling on any edge vi vj you cross exactly vi vj level curves counted with multiplicity for that purpose let us restrict our attention to some triangle t v 0 v 1 v 2 we can always suppose that t is actually an euclidean triangle we can require the level curves to be piecewise linear simply by thinking the vertices of the triangle to be of integer altitude 6 to extend this altitude linearly to the entire triangle and then to take the level curves to be those lines on which the altitude is an integer plus a half as shown on the next picture choosing the level curves to correspond to lines of elevation an integer plus a half we see that if we go up 5 meters say from altitude 1 m to altitude 6 m we cross exactly 5 curves next we orientate these curves using the following rule the angle between the normal to a curve pointing to increasing elevation and the direction of the curve itself should always be 2 figure 4 on each level curve the normal pointing to higher elevation in orange leads to an orientation of the level curve itself note that if two triangles share the same edge then the level curves of the first will end at the beginning of the level curves of the second with consistent orientation figure 5 consistency of orientation of curves 7 by assumption there is a finite number of triangles in the triangulation thus if we follow any level curve with the finger we must come back to our starting point after entering and exiting finitely many triangles thus the level curves of each triangle extend to distinct oriented loops on the surface that we see as cycles in c 1 therefore we can describe the whole process as a map d 3 c 1 c 1 note that at the moment we do not know what the addition of two level curves as oriented loops is the addition of these curves considered as cycles in c 1 is well defined but then it is unclear if the map d 3 is linear figure 6 is d 3 a linear map this matter will be settled in section 5 8 5 deforming level curves now that we know three different ways to link cohomology and homology for manifolds let us show that they actually do the same job we only consider here the case where n 2 and k 1 so that we can talk about level curves cf section 4 thus start with any 1 cocycle and consider the level curves d 3 associated to it we are going to deform these level curves in two different ways so as to get both d 1 and d 2 where d 1 and d 2 were defined in sections 2 and 3 first in any triangle of the initial triangulation consider the level curve consisting of some fixed constant altitude deform it by making its vertices glide along the edges of the triangle in the direction of the highest index like in the following picture figure 7 making vertices glide in the direction of highest index notice that we get here 2 times the vertex v 1 v 2 which is exactly the cap product of the cocycle with the triangle v 0 v 1 v 2 the same process can be undertaken for any triangle of the initial triangulation as the following figure sketches 9 figure 8 any edge joining v 0 v 2 and v 1 v 2 reduces to a point when its vertices glide toward the vertex of highest index v 3 any other edge is deformed into plus or minus v 1 v 2 as with see in figure 8 any edge joining v 0 v 2 and v 1 v 2 glides up toward the vertex v 3 thus degenerates into a point and any other edge is deformed into v 1 v 2 or its opposite depending on the orientation of that edge all in all the result of that process on any triangle v 1 v 2 is the edge v 1 v 2 counted v 0 v 1 times this result is exactly the cap product between and v 1 v 2 note that in the process we only changed the curves by performing successive homotopies on them thus we did not change the class d 3 as regarded as an element of the homology h 1 ker im here of course h 1 is thought to be a singular homology group similarly we could make the level curves glide in the following way first make every vertex of some level curve glide up to the center of the edge of the triangle that contains it then make the center of the resulting edge glide freely within the triangle up to the center of it as the following three examples to read vertically show 10 figure 9 second way of making level curves glide this time it is easy to see that the result of this process is exactly d 1 as before we did not change the class d 3 as we only applied homotopies to the curves we just proved the following proposition proposition 5 1 d 1 d 2 and d 3 are equal when regarded as mappings from ker to h 1 as a direct consequence properties that are clear for one of these maps are clear for all for instance it is clear that d 2 is linear so d 3 is linear also it is clear from a geometrical viewpoint that d 3 is always a cycle so whenever is a cocycle d 1 and d 2 are cycles that fact is usually proven in a purely algebraic way 11 6 generalization to higher dimensions in higher dimension there is no direct analogue of level curves nevertheless we can still deform the dual cellulation associated to a given cocycle i e d 1 so as to get the cap product defined cycle d 2 formally for any compact orientable triangulated manifold m of dimension n with tri angulation let t v 0 vn be a n simplex of and let s vi 0 vik be some k face of t where as usual i 1 ik recall that the dual cell associated to s in t is the convex hull of all barycenters of subsets of vertices of t that contain the vertices of s for n 3 we get the following picture the way we are going to make these barycenters move is in direct analogy with what we did in dimension 2 make the barycenter of vj 0 vjl glide within the face vj 0 vjl in the direction of the vertex of highest index in that process the barycenter of every vj 0 vjl glides up to vjl thus the dual cell associated to s vi 0 vik is easily seen to be deformed into vik vik 1 vn that face is of dimension n ik so it is either a genuine n k face if ik k i e s v 0 vk or it is degenerate i e of dimension less than n k and will add up to nothing when we sum up every k simplex of a fundamental class thus we can ignore these latter faces and see that the only n k face left is vk vn coming from the k face v 0 vk therefore if you start with any cocycle and restrict your attention to t then make the dual cellulation of move in the way explained above you get the n k face vk vn counted v 0 vk times thus as before d 1 and d 2 are equal when viewed as maps with image in hn k 12 we believe that the 3 dimensional case is enlightening figure 10 the standard 3 simplex its dual cellulation and how to make vertices glide more precisely what we see on the previous figure is from left to right first row the standard 3 simplex and its dual cellulation the dual cell associated to v 0 v 1 v 2 glides up to v 2 v 3 the dual cell associated to v 1 v 2 v 3 degenerates into the point v 3 from left to right second row the dual cell associated to v 0 v 1 glides up to the face v 1 v 2 v 3 the dual cell associated to v 1 v 2 degenerates into the edge v 2 v 3 and the dual cell associated to v 0 v 3 degenerates into the point v 3 13 7 d 3 is an isomorphism trying to explain in a geometrical way why d 1 or d 2 induces a map from h k to hn k and why it is then an isomorphism seems to be very close to doing the verifications directly with formulas in an algebraic way thus we will only show that in the restrictive case where n 2 d 3 induces an isomorphism it is actually very natural to consider d 3 instead of d 1 or d 2 for that matter since the latter are obtained by collapsing level curves see section 5 this is also motivated by allen hatcher s discussion about level curves in the idea of cohomology in 2 to show that d 3 induces a map from h 1 to h 1 we have to show that a coboundary is sent by c to a boundary in fact the converse is also true as we see from the two following lemmas lemma 7 1 a cocycle is a coboundary if and only if the altitude maps t defined up to an integer of every triangle t of the triangulation can be extended to form a global altitude defined on the vertices of which is consistent with proof saying that the altitude is consistent with means that for each edge v 0 v 1 the difference of elevation between the two points is v 0 v 1 v 1 v 0 i e it is saying that lemma 7 2 a cocycle is a coboundary if and only if the level curves associated to it are boundaries in h 1 proof direct direction if is a coboundary then by lemma 7 1 there is an altitude on the vertices of the triangulation that is consistent with extend it linearly on the whole manifold m then by construction of d 3 every curve of d 3 is of constant elevation n 1 2 for some n write cn for the curve of constant elevation n 1 2 it is easy to see that the topological boundary of each n x m x n 1 2 is the non oriented loop which is the trace of cn we leave to the reader to see how to tile the n with signed triangles so that they become 2 chains in h 2 with boundary cn h 1 then the image of under d 3 is by construction n cn that is n n which is obviously a boundary figure 11 we can always tile the colored regions n with triangles so that their boundary is cn 14 indirect direction suppose d 3 is a boundary then notice it is a boundary of a chain in h 2 which is the sum of triangles of some subdivision of let us write ti for the triangles of signed so that m i ti is a fundamental class of m then we can write as the sum i iti with i integers after examination of the condition that is the image of underd 3 we see by induction on adjacent triangles of that i j for every triangles ti tj on the same topological connected component of m minus the trace of the level curves since every vertex of is not on the trace of any level curve we can define to assign to every vertex v of the integer i where the corresponding triangle ti contains v by the preceding remark this does not depend on the choice of a triangle containing v we then obtain the required altitude details are left to the reader we obtain as a direct corollary corollary 7 3 d 3 induces an injective linear map h 1 7 h 1 that we still call d 3 to show d 3 is an isomorphism we only have left to show that it is surjective which is the purpose of the next lemma lemma 7 4 d 3 is surjective proof start with any cycle of h 1 we can in fact assume it is represented by a simple closed loop thicken it to a band of triangles as in the following figure where we have to think of the right and left parts of the band as being glued together 15 the case in pink does not appear since m is orientable perform a perturbation on the loop in order to get a loop transversal to the triangulation in pink in the following figure that loop is clearly the level curve of some cocycle which is 1 on every edge of that the pink loop crosses and 0 elsewhere details about orientation are left to the reader since it is homotopic to the red cycle we are done corollary 7 5 in dimension 2 d 1 d 2 and d 3 are all isomorphisms proof combine proposition 5 1 corollary 7 3 and lemma 7 4 notice that everything was performed geometrically 16 8 non orientable case notice that in everything we made insofar we used extensively the ordering of the vertices of the triangulation the actual orientability of m is only used to provide signs as a result by choosing any ordering of the vertices and ignoring orientation issues every construction and argument in this paper is directly transposable to the non orientable case except for the last lemma about the surjectivity of d 3 which can be fixed by a minor change
