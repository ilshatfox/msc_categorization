symmetric powers of the equivariant sphere spectrum sp z p gs 0 when g is a p group we show that the layers in the filtration are the steinberg summands of the equivariant classifying spaces of z p n for n 0 1 2 we show that the layers of the filtration split after smashing with hfp along the way we produced a general computation of the geometric fixed points of hz and hfp by using symmetric powers 1 introduction for any abelian group a and a pointed space x let a x be the space of finite a linear combinations of points on x with addition given by concatenation and the basepoint treated as 0 for any connected pointed space x the infinite symmetric power sp x is weakly equivalent to z x and so we write sp z p x z p x for the mod p symmetric powers the eilenberg maclane space k a is given by the space a s 15 stabilizing in gives the eilenberg maclane spectrum ha as the spectrum of a linear combinations of points on the sphere spectrum s 0 when the abelian group a is a ring we obtain the ring structure on ha by linearly extending the product map si sj si j let p be a prime and let us specialize to the case a z p fp thought of as a ring henceforth all spectra are understood to be p localized then as above there is an equivalence of spectra sp z p s 0 hfp the mod p infinite symmetric power model has a filtration by finite symmetric powers let spnz p s 0 sp z p s 0 be the subspectrum spnz p s 0 a 1 x 1 amxm ai 1 p 1 xi s 0 m i 1 ai p n the product restricts as sp pi z p s 0 sp pj z p s 0 sp pi j z p s 0 and we consider the filtration of spectra s 0 sp 1 z p s 0 sp p z p s 0 sp p 2 z p s 0 sp z p s 0 hfp 1 http arxiv org abs 1904 01708 v 1 the above filtration was studied by mitchell priddy and 18 theorem a identifies the n th layer of the filtration as the n th suspension of the steinberg summand of the classifying space b z p n that is there is an equivalence of spectra nenb z p n sp pn z p s 0 sp pn 1 z p s 0 where en is the topological idempotent corresponding to the idempotent element en in the group ring z p gln fp the aim of the present two part paper is to prove an equivariant generalization of the theorem of mitchell priddy theorem 1 let g be a finite p group for each positive integer n let spnz p gs 0 be the n th mod p symmetric power on the genuine g spectrum gs 0 then there is an equivalence of genuine g spectra nenbg z p n sp pn z p gs 0 sp pn 1 z p gs 0 the steinberg summand construction en and the g equivariant classifying space construc tion bgz p are both discussed in the companion paper 20 the g equivariant classifying spaces bgz p fit into a theory of equivariant principal bundles 6 but in our situation they can be built explicitly as lens spaces see 46 the symmetric powers are topological in na ture while the steinberg summand is algebraic and theorem 1 ties these two constructions together note that by work of lima filho and dos santos 13 4 there is an equivalence equiva lence of g spectra sp z p gs 0 hfp we also prove the following equivariant generaliza tion of a well known fact shown by mitchell priddy theorem 2 let g be any finite p group the filtration sp pn z p gs 0 n 0 splits into its layers after smashing with hfp that is there is an equivalence of hfp modules hfp hfp n 0 hfp n enbg z p n 1 1 intended application our intended application is towards a computation of the mod p equivariant dual steenrod algebra hfp hfp when the group is g cp the cyclic group of order p and p is an odd prime theorem 1 identifies the layers in the symmetric power filtration of the genuine eilenberg maclane g spectrum hfp theorem 2 tells us that after applying the functor hfp the filtration splits one may then construct an equivariant cellular filtration of the g space bgz p and use this filtration to compute the summands hfp n enbg z p n in an invariant theoretic manner inspired by mitchell priddy 18 this computation will appear in a joint paper with dylan wilson for the prime p 2 the c 2 equivariant dual steenrod algebra has already been computed by greenlees and later hu kriz here indicates a bigrading over the real representations of c 2 and denotes the sign representation hu kriz produced generators in c 2 hf 2 hf 2 2 1 2 of degree i 2 i 1 1 where i comes from the 2 i 1 cell of the c 2 space cp bc 2 s 0 1 of degree i 2 i 2 i 1 where i comes from the 2 i 1 cell of the c 2 space bc 2 z 2 they then proved that c 2 hf 2 hf 2 hf 2 i i 0 a u r u 2 i i 1 a i 1 r u an exposition of this computation is given in 14 it is curious that this result bears a similarity to the classical odd primary dual steenrod algebra computed by milnor hu kriz 8 used the above computations to analyze the adams novikov spectral sequence for bpr which converges to the 2 local stable homotopy groups of spheres 1 2 historical significance the study of the mod p cohomology of the symmetric power filtration traces back to nakaoka 19 who studied the symmetric power filtration for hz the n th layer in this filtration is given a name spp n s 0 spp n 1 s 0 nl n it is classically known that l n en b z p n n i e that l n is the steinberg summand of the thom spectrum on b z p n corresponding to the reduced regular representation n z p n o pn 1 see the paper of arone dwyer lesh 3 for a proof of this fact the closely related spectra m n enb z p n which 18 appear as the layers in the mod p symmetric power were used by mitchell provide a short proof of the conner floyd conjecture 17 it is also a result of welcher 21 that the spectrum m n has chromatic type n let h denote mod p cohomology the mod p symmetric power filtration of hfp closely reflects the structure of the steenrod algebra mitchell priddy showed in 18 that h sp pn z p s 0 has a basis given by the classes i un where un h 0 sp pn z p s 0 is a generator and i varies over admissible sequences of length at most n within this vector space h nm n is the span of the classes i un with length i n a paper of mitchell 16 demonstrates the algebra and invariant theory involved the whitehead conjecture proven by kuhn 12 9 states that the attaching maps yield a long exact sequence on homotopy groups l 3 l 2 l 1 s 0 hz 0 this is a resolution of the spectrum hz by spacelike spectra i e spectra which are stable summands of spaces 11 kuhn s orignial and also his modern proof 10 utilizes the fact that there are almost no a module maps between the h l n s which is a kind of rigidity result it is an observation due to mitchell priddy that m n l n l n 1 and there is a mod p version of the whitehead conjecture the main theorems of the present paper suggest that the above story may have an equivariant analogue 3 1 3 outline of the paper our proof of theorem 1 is inspired by mitchell priddy s proof of the nonequivariant ana logue which is by induction on n the n 1 case namely that e 1 bz p b p hfp p hfp 1 is done by an explicit geometric argument now let n 2 both the stein berg summands and the mod p symmetric powers are equipped with product maps but the product maps on steinberg summands have retractions one has an intermediate inclusion of the steinberg summand enb z p n e 1 e 1 b z p n now construct the commutative diagram nenb z p n id n e 1 bz p n product nenb z p n sp p z p s 0 sp 1 z p s 0 n product sp pn z p s 0 sp pn 1 z p s 0 1 1 mitchell priddy prove that the zigzag composition nenb z p n hfp pn hfp pn 1 from the top left to the bottom right of this diagram is an isomorphism on mod p cohomology and therefore is a p local equivalence the proof is by induction on n and requires a particular lemma about the interaction of the en with the action of a in cohomology 18 section 5 our proof of theorem 1 follows a similar strategy the n 1 case is proven in section 5 for n 2 we construct the analogous commutative diagram and must prove that the zigzag composition nenbg z p n sp pn z p gs 0 sp pn 1 z p gs 0 is a p local equivalence of genuine g spectra by induction on the group g it suffices to prove the zigzag composition is a mod p homology isomorphism on geometric fixed point spectra most of the hard supporting work in the proof is in computing the geometric fixed point spectra g enbg z p n done in 20 and g sp pn z p gs 0 sp pn 1 z p gs 0 and computing the effect of the maps in the above diagram here is an outline of this paper in section 2 we define the notion of the primitives of a g space x and prove a wedge sum decomposition of the geometric fixed points of the mod p symmetric powers of a suspension g spectrum gx whose summands depend on the fixed point space xg and the primitives of the g space s g in section 3 we prove that the primitives of s g are the homotopy orbit space of a certain subgroup complex in section 4 we compute the effect of the product maps relating the geometric fixed point spectra gspnz p gs 0 n 0 as they pertain to our decomposition of the geometric fixed points in section 5 we prove that there is an equivalence of g spectra sp p z p gs 0 sp 1 z p gs 0 g bgaff 1 where aff 1 is the group of p p 1 affine permutations of the one dimensional fp line this is the n 1 case of theorem 1 in section 6 we combine the cumulative results of 20 and 4 sections 2 3 4 to describe the zigzag composition of diagram 1 1 on the homology of the geometric fixed points f h g nenbg z p n fp h g sp pn z p gs 0 sp pn 1 z p gs 0 fp we then use matrix algebra to prove that this map is an isomorphism completing the proof of theorem 1 finally in section 7 we prove theorem 2 using a short and straightforward argument 2 fixed points in symmetric powers let g be a finite group and let x be a pointed g space we decompose the g fixed points of the infinite symmetric power sp x by using a tower of fibrations specifically we produce in proposition 10 a finite sequence of topological abelian monoids sp xg f 0 f 1 f 2 fm sp x g and identify fi 1 fi as the homotopy fiber of a map from fi to the infinite symmetric power of what we call a primitive of the g action on x or prg h x there is a single primitive functor and hence a single layer for each conjugacy class of subgroups of g in proposition 11 we generalize this decomposition to the free z p module generated by x i e the mod p symmetric powers the case of proposition 10 being p 0 the main content of proposition 11 is that this decomposition splits if g is a p group in proposition 19 we extend this decomposition to the case of the geometric fixed points g of the infinite symmetric power of a suspension g spectrum gx in the context of spectra we may exploit two further phenomena fiber and cofiber sequences coincide and the natural nonequivariant map x spn s 0 spn x is an equivalence this allows us to decompose the geometric fixed points of the finite sym metric power gspn gx in a similar manner to our decomposition for sp this is proposition 19 combining propo sition 19 with proposition 11 we obtain a decomposition of gspnz p gx when g is a p group this is proposition 20 the infinite symmetric power of the genuine g spectrum gs 0 is a model for the equivariant eilenberg maclane spectrum hz and therefore the finite symmetric powers are a filtration for this genuine g spectrum corollary 23 we thus deduce decompositions of the geometric fixed point spectra g hz and g hfp in propositions 24 and 25 5 2 1 symmetric powers with coefficients definition 3 let x be a pointed g space and let n 1 be a positive integer the n th symmetric power of x is the pointed g space spn x x n n there are inclusions spn 1 x spn x given by adding a copy of the basepoint of x the quotient of this inclusion is given by spn 1 x spn x x n n the infinite symmetric power of x is the colimit sp x colimn sp n x x 1 x 2 xn x 1 xn x the space sp x is the free topological abelian monoid on x and we write its elements as formal sums as above it is easily seen that spn is a functor from pointed g spaces to pointed g spaces enjoying the following properties 1 there is an addition map given by formally summing spm x spn x spm n x 2 because the addition map is commutative there is an amalgamation map spm spn x spmn x 3 there is a multiplication map given by formally multiplying spm x spn y spmn x y more generally if m is any g module one may define the free topological m module over x denoted by m x see definition 2 1 in 4 for the precise definition m x m 1 x 1 mnxn mi m xi x the group g acts on the space m x by acting on both coordinates simultaneously when m is the group z with trivial g action then the inclusion sp x z x is a weak equivalence as long as xh is connected for every subgroup h when m z p with trivial action we given a special name to this functor 6 definition 4 for any pointed g space x define the infinite mod p symmetric power of x as the topological z p module sp z p z p x a 1 x 1 anxn ai z p xi x there is an obvious surjection sp x sp z p x we define the n th mod p symmetric power denoted spnz p x as the image of sp n x under this surjection note that spn x spnz p x for 1 n p 1 it is easily seen that for any g module a the functor a takes cofiber sequences of pointed g spaces to fiber sequences of unpointed g spaces 2 2 the primitives of a g space let g be a finite group and let x be a g space for any two subgroups h k g there is an inclusion of fixed point spaces xk xh thus definition 5 the fixed point spaces xh h g define a filtration of x indexed over the opposite poset of subgroups of g we call this filtration the fixed point filtration of x the space xh carries an action of the normalizer subgroup ng h g g ghg 1 h since h acts trivially on xh we obtain a residual action of the weyl group wg h ng h h upon x h definition 6 we let x h denote the h th layer in the fixed point filtration i e x h xh k h xk by definition each point x x h has isotropy group g g gx x h therefore the weyl group wg h acts freely on the pointed space x h and we define the quotient of this action as the g h primitives of x prg h x x h wg h example 7 the first stage of the fixed point filtration is prg g x xg for each subgroup h prg h is a functor from pointed g spaces to pointed spaces enjoying the following properties 1 suppose that h h g are conjugate that is there is some g g such that h ghg 1 left action by g induces a homeomorphism g x h x h and therefore a homeomorphism prg h x prg h x 7 2 let h denote the set of subgroups of g which are conjugate to h then g acts on the wedge sum h h x h and the isotropy group of x x h is h one may just as well define prg h x as the strict quotient prg h x h h x h g 3 product for i 1 2 let gi be a finite group hi gi a subgroup and xi a pointed gi space then there is a product map which is a homeomorphism prg 1 h 1 x 1 pr g 2 h 2 x pr g 1 g 2 h 1 h 2 x 1 x 2 2 3 subgroup orderings we would like to convert the fixed point filtration of x into a true filtration and this motivates the following definition definition 8 a subgroup ordering for g is a sequence of subgroups h 0 h 1 hm g satisfying two properties 1 every subgroup of g is conjugate to exactly one of the hi 2 if i j then no conjugate of hi is a subgroup of hj these two properties imply that h 0 g and hm 1 given a subgroup ordering h 0 hm one may construct an honest filtration of x xg xh 0 h h 1 xh h h 2 xh h hm 1 xh xhm x 2 1 it is clear that when g is a finite group a subgroup ordering exists and henceforth we will simply pick one for our purposes it does not matter which one 2 4 fixed points and primitives recall that sp x denotes the free abelian monoid on the pointed g space x the g fixed point space sp x g sp x is the space of sums x 1 xn such that g permutes the points x 1 xn in some fashion in general the topological abelian monoid sp x g is not a free one i e there is no pointed space y such that sp x g sp y we will use the fixed point filtration of x to product a resolution of sp x g by the free abelian monoids sp prg hi x proposition 10 we will also show that the analogous resolution of sp z p x g splits as a cartesian product when g is a p group proposition 11 our proofs will rely on the following lemma 8 lemma 9 let h g be a subgroup and suppose that every point x x has isotropy group conjugate to h let g h g h denote the index of the subgroup h then 1 the fixed point space sp x g is the free abelian monoid sp x g sp sp g h x g with the homeomorphism given by amalgamation 2 there is a homeomorphism sp g h x g pr g h x proof 1 is immediate from the observation that any sum x 1 x 2 xn sp x g decomposes as a sum of g orbits isomorphic to g h now we prove 2 let a ng h h and let b g ng h so that g h ab by definition prg h x xh wg h the transfer map xh wg h sp g h x g x 7 g g h gx has an inverse given as follows if x 1 x g h is a g fixed point of sp g h x then there are a points xj with isotropy group h pick one the image of xj in the quotient space xh wg h does not depend on which point we pick and g g h gxj x 1 x g h proposition 10 let h 0 h 1 hm be a subgroup ordering definition 8 for g then the functor sp g has a filtration by functors valued in topological abelian monoids sp g f 0 f 1 f 2 fm 1 fm sp g where for each 1 i m the map fi 1 fi is the homotopy fiber of a fibration fi sp prg hi proof fix a pointed g space x for 0 i n let ci denote the subspace ci h hi xh then as in equation 2 1 one has the following filtration of x xg c 0 c 1 cm 1 cm x for each 0 i n let fi sp ci g the functor sp definition 3 takes cofiber sequences to fiber sequences and the functor g preserves fiber sequences thus for each 1 i n one has a fiber sequence fi 1 fi sp ci ci 1 g 9 every isotropy group of the cofiber ci ci 1 is conjugate to hi thus by lemma 9 there is a homeomorphism sp ci ci 1 g sp prg hi ci ci 1 it is easily seen that prg hi ci ci 1 pr g hi x by the definition of the primitive functor 6 thus the proof is complete x x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 x 7 x 8 x 9 pictured an element of sp 9 x g with three orbits proposition 11 let g be a p group let h 0 h 1 hm be a subgroup ordering 8 for g then the functor sp z p g has a filtration by functors valued in topological abelian monoids sp z p g f 0 f 1 f 2 fm 1 fm sp z p g where for each 1 i m the map fi 1 fi is the homotopy fiber of a split fibration fi 1 fi sp z p pr g hi vv thus the functor sp z p g splits as a cartesian product sp z p g m i 0 sp z p pr g hi proof fix a pointed g space x for 0 i n let ci denote the subspace ci h hi xh as in proposition 10 let fi sp z p ci g consider the continuous map of pointed spaces f xhi fi defined by f x g g hi gx observe the following two properties of f 10 if the isotropy group of x is some k hi then the index k hi is a power of p because g is a p group and it follows that f x 0 therefore the map f factors through the quotient xhi k hi xk it is easily checked that for any w in the weyl group wg hi we have f wx f x so f descends to a map f prg hi x xhi k hi xk w z p h hi xh g extend this map z p linearly to obtain the desired section map sp z p pr g hi x fi it is easily seen that this map is the inverse to the fibration fi sp z p pr g hi x as a corollary we deduce the existence of another structure map for the primitives functor when g is a finite p group let g g be any subgroup and let heg be a normal subgroup let h g h denote the intersection then the g set g h decomposes as a g set into the disjoint union of pm g h g h copies of g h i e resgg g h g h g h g h the reason for assuming that h eg is to avoid subtlety about how ghg 1 g may vary in size for different conjugate subgroups ghg 1 for any g space x consider the inclusion of fixed points sp z p x g sp z p x g using the cartesian product decomposition of proposition 11 we obtain a z p module map sp z p pr g h x sp z p pr g h x which is the free z p module on a map prg h x sp pm z p prg h x definition 12 the map prg h x sp pm z p prg h x described above is called the re striction map for primitives 2 5 passing to spectra for our purposes a spectrum x is a sequence of pointed spaces x 0 x 1 x 2 with specified structure maps xn xn 1 a map between spectra f x y is a collection of maps fn xn yn compatible with the structure maps such a map f is an equivalence if fn is an equivalence on homotopy groups up to dimension n n for every n where z 0 z 0 is some function such that lim n n intuitively this means that as n grows the connectivity of fn grows at a rate faster than n when g is a finite or compact lie group there are two types of g spectra to consider see 7 for a detailed working guide to equivariant spectra 11 definition 13 a na ve g spectrum x is a sequence of pointed g spaces x 0 x 1 x 2 with specified g equivariant maps xn xn 1 for example if x is a pointed g space then its na ve suspension spectrum is the na ve g spectrum x sn x n 0 for every subgroup h g one has the fixed point spectrum xh xhn n 0 a map f x y of na ve g spectra is said to be an equivalence if fh xh yh is an equivalence of spectra for every subgroup h g definition 14 let ro g denote the orthogonal representation ring of g and let g resp g denote the regular resp reduced regular real representation of g a genuine g spectrum x is a collection of pointed g spaces xv for every orthogonal g representation v with specified g equivariant maps sw v xv xw whenever v is a subrepresentation of w for example if x is a pointed g space then its genuine suspension spectrum is the genuine g spectrum gx sv x v ro g the geometric fixed point spectrum gx is the spectrum whose n th space is defined by gx n x g n g for each subgroup h g let i hx denote the genuine h spectrum given by restricting the action and define hx gi hx a map f x y of genuine g spectra is said to be an equivalence if hi hf h i hx h i hy is an equivalence of spectra for every subgroup h g note that of x is a pointed g space then g gx xg definition 15 any na ve g spectrum x xn n 0 may be promoted to a genuine g spectrum xv v ro g as follows for any orthogonal representation v let v g denote the fixed points and v v denote an orthogonal complement to v g note that v g 0 then we define pointed g spaces xv indexed over the orthogonal representations v by xv s v xv g this construction defines a functor i from na ve g spectra to genuine g spectra and this functor can be viewed as inverting the representation sphere s g it is easily checked that g i x x g let n be a positive integer the n th symmetric power functor spn may be applied to a na ve or genuine g spectrum by application to each component space we decompose 12 the geometric fixed points of the n th symmetric power of a genuine suspension spectrum of a pointed g space x via a filtration of spectra spn xg f 0 f 1 fm g spn gx where the cofiber of the map fi 1 fi is given by a smash product of three factors cof fi 1 fi x g sp n ci s 0 prg hi s g where ci is the index of the subgroup hi in g this is proposition 19 our proof relies on lemmas 16 17 and 18 about finite symmetric powers in the stable setting stated below and proven at the end of this section these are equivariant analogues to several lemmas in 2 section 7 lemma 16 the natural transformation spn gs 0 spn g is an equivalence of functors from pointed g spaces to genuine g spectra in particular this functor preserves cofiber sequences lemma 17 the functor spn from pointed g spaces to na ve g spectra preserves cofiber sequences note it is not true that x spn s 0 spn x is an equivalence for example if x is a g space whose fixed points are contractible then the two na ve g spectra above have different g fixed points lemma 18 for any nonnegative integer there is an inclusion of g representation spheres s g s s g the resulting natural transformation of functors from pointed g spaces to spectra is an equivalence g spn g spn s g g given these three lemmas we state and prove the main proposition of this section proposition 19 let h 0 hm be a subgroup ordering of g and for each i let ci g hi then the functor g spn g from pointed g spaces to spectra has a filtration by functors spn g f 0 f 1 fm g spn g where fi 1 fi is the homotopy fiber of a fibration fi g sp n ci s 0 prg hi s g 13 proof let x be any pointed g space by lemma 16 the natural inclusion xg g spn gs 0 g spn gx is an equivalence of spectra it therefore suffices to prove the proposition when x s 0 by lemma 18 g spn gs 0 spn s g g so we instead compute spn s g g consider the isotropy filtration of s g s 0 c 1 c 2 cm s g ci h hi s h g where the cofiber of the inclusion ci 1 ci is denoted s g hi applying the functor spn g to this diagram one obtains a filtration spn s 0 spn c 1 g spn cm g spn s g g by proposition 17 the cofiber of the inclusion spn ci 1 g spn ci g is spn s g hi g sp n ci prg hi s g which completes the proof since the associated fibration sequences in the mod p symmetric powers split via propo sition 11 we deduce the following result in a manner similar to the proof of proposition 19 above proposition 20 let h 0 hm be a subgroup ordering of g and for each i let ci g hi there is an equivalence between the two functors from pointed g spaces to nonequivariant spectra gspnz p g g m i 0 sp n ci z p s 0 prg hi s g we now prove lemmas 16 17 and 18 lemma 21 let rn denote the reduced standard n 1 dimensional representation of n let be a subgroup of the cartesian product g n such that 1 n is nontransitive then the fixed points of the representation g rn are nonzero proof let 1 n since is nontransitive there is a vector w rn which is fixed under pick any vector v g such that the images gv g g are linearly indepdent and consider the vector u v w 14 clearly u is fixed by so it suffices to prove that u is nonzero let h denote the projection of onto g and let denote the projection of onto n it is easily checked that is a normal subgroup of and so may be thought of as the graph of a homomorphism f h then u v w h h hv f h w which is clearly nonzero because the images hv h h are linearly independent vectors in the representation g proof of lemma 16 we use induction on n the case n 1 is a tautology now consider general n we will show that for any positive integer and any subgroup h g the natural map x spn s g h spn x s g h is an isomorphism on homotopy groups up through dimension 2 1 note that for any pointed g space y spn y spn 1 y y n n and so it suffices for us to show that the natural map x s g n n x s g n n is 2 1 connected to prove this it suffices to show that for any subgroup g n the map of fixed point spaces x s g n x n s g n is 2 1 connected let h denote the projection of onto g the two terms above can be rewritten as follows xh s g h s g r n x n s g h s g r n if 1 n is transitive then x n xh and the map above is the identity map so we are done suppose instead that 1 n is nontransitive then s g h has dimension at least i and by lemma 21 s g r n has dimension at least i thus the two spaces above are each at least a 2 fold suspension and therefore the map shown is automatically 2 1 connected proof of lemma 17 we use induction on n the base case n 1 is a tautology now consider general n let x y z be a cofiber sequence of pointed g spaces by an argument analogous to the previous lemma it suffices to show that for any subgroup g n the map of fixed point spaces s n y n x n s n z n is 2 1 connected define to be the projection of onto n if is nontransitive then s n s o where o is the number of orbits of 1 n under the action of then 15 the two spaces above are each at least a 2 fold suspension and the map above is automatically 2 1 connected suppose that is transitive let h g 1 then for any g space a the map f a n ah f a 1 an a 1 is a homeomorphism this is true because a 1 can be freely chosen to be any h fixed point of a and each ai is uniquely determined by the point a 1 therefore y n x n y h xh and z n zh the pointed spaces y h xh and zh are homotopy equivalent and therefore the map of fixed points is an equivalence proof of lemma 18 by induction on n it suffices to prove that the map of pointed spaces s s g n s s g n is a 2 1 equivalence if the fixed points of the representation g r n are zero then the above map is an equivalence if the fixed points of the representation g r n are nonzero then both of the spaces above are 2 fold suspensions and the map is a 2 1 equivalence 2 6 equivariant eilenberg maclane spectra let x be a based g cw complex and let m be a g module recall either from section 2 1 or from 4 definition 2 1 that m x denotes the free topological m module over x where g acts diagonally when m z one obtains a g space weakly equivalent to the infinite symmetric power of x and when m z p one obtains the infinite mod p symmetric power of x these topological modules were studied in the papers 13 and 4 where it was shown that the equivariant homotopy groups of m x encode the equivariant homology groups of x definition 22 let g be a finite group and let m be a mackey functor for the group g then there is a genuine g spectrum hm called the eilenberg maclane spectrum for m which represents the functor for bredon co homology with coefficients in m we will not use equivariant homotopy groups equivariant homology groups or mackey functors in this paper and so we will not define them the reader may consult 5 for a reference however our main result is motivated by a desire to decompose the equivariant eilenberg maclane spectrum hfp which is the genuine g spectrum representing bredon co homology with coefficients in the trivial g module fp thus we illuminate the connection to mod p symmetric powers the primary result we are interested in is 4 theorem 1 1 which states that m x is an equivariant infinite loop space and there is an equivalence natural in both the g space x and the g module m gv m x h gv x m 16 when g is the trivial group the above result reduces to the classical dold thom theorem if we let x denote the representation sphere sv then one obtains an equivalence of equivariant infinite loop spaces m sv k m v using naturality we obtain an equivalence of genuine g spectra m gs 0 hm if m is a ring with a unit 1 m then hm is a ring spectrum and the inclusion gs 0 m gs 0 hm is the unit of the genuine g spectrum hm the following corollary is immediate corollary 23 there are filtrations of genuine g spectra gs 0 sp 1 gs 0 sp 2 gs 0 sp 3 gs 0 sp gs 0 hz gs 0 sp 1 z p gs 0 sp 2 z p gs 0 sp 3 z p gs 0 sp

primitives prg h s g 17 3 the primitives of an infinite representation sphere let g be a finite group and let x be a pointed g space we compute the primitives of the g equivariant suspension spectrum of x which is an equivalent task to describing the space prg h s g x proposition 32 to give the explicit description we must give two definitions definition 26 for any unpointed space y we use the notation y to denote the unreduced suspension of y the space y will be considered based with the image of y 0 y as the basepoint in this way even if y is not a based space y is definition 27 for any subgroup h g we write p g h to be the poset of proper sub groups of g which strictly contain h let ng h g g ghg 1 h denote the normalizer subgroup of h and let wg h ng h h denote the weyl group then proposition 32 states that prg h s g x p g h hwg h x g the main idea of the proof is that one may cover k h s k g by the contractible subspaces s k g where k varies over the poset p g h g with this covering one may prove using lemma 30 that k h s k g p g h when we restrict our attention to p groups g a further simplification occurs any p group g has a maximal elementary abelian quotient g g f where f denotes the kernel of the quotient map definition 33 if h does contain the subgroup f then we show the poset p g h is contractible lemma 34 this allows us to simplify the expression above and this simplification is stated in proposition 35 proposition 29 combines all of the results of this section into a form we will use later definition 28 let g be a finite p group we let c be the set c h eg g h is an elementary abelian p group the set c is closed under taking intersections and its minimal element f is the frattini subgroup of g definition 33 a subgroup h is contained in c if and only if f h proposition 29 let g be a p group then there is an equivalence of z p modules sp z p s g g h c sp z p p g h b g h 18 proof proposition 11 implies that there is a homeomorphism sp z p s g g m i 0 sp z p pr g hi s g where h 0 hm are representatives for the conjugacy classes of subgroups of g proposition 35 implies that prg h s g p g h b g h h c h c the result immediately follows 3 1 coverings and posets we familiarize the reader with a computational tool which will be crucial to us let p be a finite poset suppose that y is a pointed topological space a functor y p top is called a covering of y if hocolimpy y if y and y are two functors such that there is a natural homotopy equivalence between them then hocolimpy hocolimpy if we replace y by a diagram whose maps are all cofibrations then the homotopy colimit is the union a p y a now suppose that for any two elements a b p there is a unique maximal element a b such that a a b and b a b such posets are called meet semilattices if p is a finite meet semilattice then p has a unique minimal element which we denote by 0 let p 0 p 0 lemma 30 consider a functor y p top with the property that y a whenever a 6 0 then hocolimpy y 0 p 0 proof for any a p let p a x p x a the pointed space y 0 p has a covering y defined by y a y 0 p a 0 if a 6 0 then the poset p a 0 has a maximal element namely a so it is contractible and thus y a if a 0 it s obvious that p 0 0 is empty and therefore its unreduced suspension is s 0 thus y y and so hocolimpy hocolimpy y 0 p 0 now suppose that p and q are two posets and f p q is an order preserving map let us suppose that x p top and y q top are two functors such that 1 for every a p there is a map ga x a y f a 19 2 if a b then the following diagram commutes x a ga y f a x b gb y f b then there is an induced map hocolimpx hocolimqy the lemma below states that the homotopy equivalence of lemma 30 is functorial in a strong sense lemma 31 suppose further that p and q are finite meet semilattices and for every a b p f a b f a f b if x a whenever a 6 0 and y c whenever c 6 0 then the map hocolimpx hocolimqy is the map g 0 f x 0 p 0 y 0 q 0 proof as in the proof of the previous lemma replace x with the homotopy equivalent functor x defined by x a x 0 p a 0 and replace y with the homotopy equivalent functor y defined by y c y 0 q c 0 3 2 the primitives of an infinite representation sphere proposition 32 let g be a finite group and let x be a pointed g space then for any subgroup h g prg h s g x p g h hw x g where w wg h is the weyl group of h proof if h g then prg g s g x s 0 xg and by convention p g g x g s 1 xg this deals with the case h g so let us henceforth assume h 6 g by definition prg h s g x sits in a cofiber sequence w k h s k g xk w s h g xh prg h s g x every point in the the quotient space s h g xh k h s k g xk has isotropy group equal to h and therefore w acts freely on this quotient space so we may replace the strict quotient by the homotopy quotient k h s k g xk hw s h g xh hw pr g h s g x since h g the w space s h g xh ew has underlying points s xh ew and its fixed points under any nonzero subgroup of w are also contractible because w 20 acts freely on ew therefore s h g xh ew is contractible as a w space and so s h g xh hw it follows that pr g h s g x k h s k g xk hw let p g h denote the poset of all subgroups strictly containing h the space k h s k g xk has a covering y indexed over p g h it is defined by y k s k g xk k 6 g xg k g therefore lemma 30 implies that k h s k g xk hocolimp hy y g p h x g p h this completes the proof 3 3 subgroups complexes and the frattini subgroup definition 33 let f g denote the intersection of all of the maximal proper subgroups of g it is commonly referred to as the frattini subgroup when g is a p group f is the minimal subgroup of g such that g f is an elementary abelian p group lemma 34 if h does not contain the frattini subgroup of g then p g h is contractible proof for any subgroup k of g let kf denote the minimal subgroup of g containing both k and f consider the poset map f p g h p g h k 7 kf any proper subgroup k is contained in some maximal subgroup m of g and therefore the group kf is also contained in m mf therefore kf is also a proper subgroup of g and so f is a well defined map since kf k for every k the map f is homotopic to the identity because kf hf for every k the map f is homotopic to the constant map at hf it follows that p g h is contractible proposition 35 suppose g is a finite group and x is any pointed g space if h does not contain the frattini subgroup of g then prg h s g x if h contains the frattini subgroup of g then prg h s g x p g h b g h x g 21 proof by proposition 32 prg h s g x p g h hw x g if h does not contain the frattini subgroup then p g h has contractible underlying points and thus p g h hw is contractible if h does contain the frattini subgroup then every subgroup containing h is normal and thus w acts trivially on p g h thus p g h hw p g h bw 4 products on primitives let x and y be pointed g spaces consider the composition below where the second map is inclusion of fixed points for the diagonal inclusion g g g sp z p x g sp z p y g sp z p x y g g sp z p x y g specialize to the case x y s g there is a homeomorphism of g spaces x y s g s g s g given by interleaving the copies of the reduced regular representation g thus we obtain a product structure on the z p module sp z p s g g it is a z p algebra whose 0 element is the basepoint let us assume that g is a p group the goal of this section is to analyze the product on sp z p s g g in terms of its free z p module basis which arises from propositions 11 and 29 sp z p s g g h c sp z p pr g h s g h c sp z p p g h b g h 4 1 let h k c definition 28 then the h factor smashed with the k factor maps to the h k factor in the decomposition of equation 4 1 in the following way let pm denote the ratio g h g k g h k where m 0 the product on the basis elements prg h s g is the composition prg h s g prg k s g pr g g h k s g s g sp pm z p prg h k s g 4 2 the first map in equation 4 2 is the product for primitives definition 6 and the second is restriction for primitives definition 12 along the diagonal inclusion g g g definition 36 suppose that g is a p group and let h k c definition 28 we say that h and k are transverse if the diagonal inclusion below is an isomorphism g h k g h g k equivalently h and k are transverse iff g h g k g h k 1 if the diagonal inclusion is not an isomorphism we say h and k are nontransverse 22 in the case where h and k are transverse the composition of equation 4 2 can be described explicitly in terms of a natural product on subgroup complexes and this is done in proposition 39 if h and k are nontransverse the situation is more subtle and for our purposes the following weaker result suffices consider the stable analogue of equation 4 1 which results from propositions 20 and 29 g sp z p gs 0 h c sp z p s 0 prg h s g 4 3 the stable version of equation 4 2 with the middle term omitted is prg h s g prg k s g sp pm z p s 0 prg h k s g 4 4 definition 37 let sp n z p denote the functor sp n z p sp n z p sp n 1 z p there is an obvious quotient map spnz p sp n z p proposition 43 says that the following composition is zero on fp homology prg h s g prg k s g sp pm z p s 0 prg h k s g sp pm z p s 0 prg h k s g this requires some work to do and is a result of the following more general lemma let v be an fp vector space of rank m viewed as an abelian group let x be a pointed v space and let 0 be a positive integer then we prove lemma 42 that the composition below where the first map is the restriction and the second is the quotient prv x sp pm z p x sp pm z p x is zero on fp homology in degrees 1 p 1 we then take x pr g h k s g s g and v g h g k g h k and let to deduce proposition 43 4 1 subgroup complexes and transverse subgroups recall that p g h denotes the poset of proper subgroups of g which strictly contain h definition 27 and p g h denotes its unreduced suspension regarded as a pointed space we write p g h to mean the poset of all subgroups of g which contain h including both h and g itself then there is a map of posets p g h p g k p g h k 23 h k 7 h k if h and k are transverse then h k h k if and only if h h and k k therefore we obtain a product map on the unreduced join of the two spaces p g h and p g k p g h p g k p g h k note that the join of two spaces is the same as the suspension of their smash product definition 38 let g be a group and let h k e g be subgroups such that the diagonal inclusion g h k g h g k is an isomorphism the assignment h k 7 h k yields a map of pointed spaces p g h p g k p g h k which we call the subgroup complex product proposition 39 let g be a p group let h k c be transverse subgroups of g under the equivalence prg h s g p g h b g h of proposition 35 the composite map prg h s g prg k s g prg h k s g in equation 4 2 is give by the subgroup complex product smashed with the equivalence b g h b g k b g h k proof the fixed point space s h g has a covering indexed over the poset p g h the cover element corresponding to the subgroup h h is s h g the fixed point space s k g has a similar covering the behavior of the interleaving map s h g s k g s h k g s h k g s h k g with respect to this covering sends h k to h k because h and k are transverse one has that h k h k if and only if h h and k k therefore the interleaving map descends to the associated graded s h g h h s h g s k g k k s k g s h k g l h k s l g and this map is given by the subgroup complex product p g h p g k p g h k the action of g h k on each side is trivial so upon applying g h k homotopy orbits we get the desired result 24 4 2 cyclic powers and primitives let y be a pointed space the symmetric powers of y are defined in terms of the symmetric group we will define mod p cyclic powers in terms of elementary abelian p groups the mod p cyclic powers of y will be used to describe the restriction map on primitives definition 40 let m be any positive integer and let v z p m let fun v y be the space of maps from v viewed as a discrete space to y with an action of v given by vf w f v 1 w v w v f fun v y for two functions f f fun v y suppose that there are p points v 1 vp v such that f v 1 f vp f v 1 f vp and f v f v v v v 1 vp then we write f f and let denote the equivalence relation on fun v y generated by the above conditions the quotient fun v y v is the v th mod p cyclic power of y and is denoted by cycvz p y there is an obvious quotient map cyc v z p y sp pm z p y note the equivalence relation is what makes it mod p without this relation we obtain a construction fun v y v which we would call cycv y if we had any use for it definition 41 let fun 0 v y fun v y denote the subspace consisting of those maps which send at least one vector v to the basepoint of y and let fun v y fun v y fun 0 v y the quotient fun v y v is called the reduced v th mod p cyclic power of y and is denoted by cyc v z p y there is a commutative square of cycvz p y sp pm z p y cyc v z p y sp pm z p y now suppose that y is a pointed v space and let y e denote its underlying points let y fun v y e denote the v equivariant map defined by y v vy let 0 fun v y e denote the function which sends every element of v to the basepoint of y e it is easily seen that if w v is a nonzero subspace and y y w then y 0 therefore determines a map of pointed spaces prv y y w 6 0 y w v fun v y e v cycvz p y e 4 5 25 crucially for us we have a commutative diagram where the composition along the top row is the restriction map of definition 12 prv y cycvz p y e sp pm z p y e cyc v z p y e sp pm z p y e 4 6 the entire preceding discussion is natural in y i e all maps arise from natural transfor mations of functors from pointed v spaces to pointed spaces the following lemma describes the behavior of the dotted map in the stable range lemma 42 let v z p m let x be a pointed space with an action of v and let 0 be a positive integer then letting y x in equation 4 6 the composition prv x cycvz p x e cyc v z p x e is zero on reduced fp homology in degrees 1 p 1 therefore the map of spectra prv x cycvz p x e cyc v z p x is zero on fp homology and therefore the composition of the restriction map definition 12 with the quotient map is zero on fp homology prv x sp pm z p x e sp pm z p x proof we first address the case where dim v 1 i e v z p let v v denote a generator write y x then the v space fun v y e can be identified with the cartesian product y p with the permutation action of the group z p let y y p denote the diagonal map and let tw y y p denote the twisted diagonal map tw y y vy v 2 y vp 1 y consider the following commutative diagram of pointed spaces where the maps y v y are the inclusion of the fixed points and the columns are cofiber sequences y v y y y tw y p y p y y v y p im y p im 4 7 26 after quotienting by the free action of v the bottom row of diagram 4 7 is the composition prv y cycvz p y e cyc v z p y e therefore it suffices to prove that the composition along the bottom row of diagram 4 7 is zero on homology in the stable range the space y p has homology concentrated in degree p and higher and so it is stably contractible apply the functor h to diagram 4 7 for any p 1 omitting the middle column and adding another row at the top to obtain h 1 y y v h j h 1 y p im h y v f g h y h y 0 h y y v h h y p im 4 8 the maps f and g are equal and g j 0 thus f j 0 and thus h 0 thus h 0 as desired now suppose dim v 2 write v l w where dim l 1 there is an obvious natural transformation fun l fun w fun v and therefore a natural transformation cyclz p cyc w z p cyc v z p this natural transformation descends to the reduced cyclic powers cyc l z p cyc w z p cyc v z p the composition prv pr l prw cyc l z p pr w cyc l z p cyc w z p cyc v z p is the restriction prv cyc v z p by the dimension 1 case the first step of this compo sition prl prw x prl prw x cyc l z p prw x cyc l z p pr w x is zero on fp homology in degrees 1 p 1 therefore the composition pr v x cyc v z p x is zero on fp homology in degrees 1 p 1 27 proposition 43 let g be a p group let h k c be nontransverse subgroups of g let pm g h g k g h k consider the following diagram where the horizontal map is the product of diagram 4 4 and the vertical map is the quotient prg h s g prg k s g sp pm z p s 0 prg h k s g sp pm z p s 0 prg h k s g the composition dotted is zero on fp homology proof take x prg h k s g s g where g acts diagonally on s g s g let v g h g k g h k observe that x has a residual action of v and prv x prg h s g prg k s g the last line of lemma 42 immediately implies the desired result 5 the first layer of the filtration let g be a p group and let x be any pointed g space let aff 1 z p gl 1 fp be the group consisting of affine transformation of the one dimensional vector space over fp and fix an inclusion aff 1 p into the symmetric group on p letters the equivariant classifying space bg is a functor from groups to g space and is constructed in definition 45 the notion of a p local equivalence of spectra is definition 48 the main result of this section is the following proposition which is proven here using several intermediate results to be proven in the body of this section proposition 44 there is a p local equivalence of genuine g spectra sp p z p gx sp 1 gx x s 1 g bgaff 1 note the equivalence above is the n 1 case of theorem 1 proof there is a cofiber sequence of functors sp 1 spp sp p z p where is the diagonal map thus by lemma 16 there is a natural equivalence of genuine g spectra sp p z p gx sp 1 z p gx x sp p z p gs 0 sp 1 z p gs 0 28 proposition 49 implies that the quotient map is a p local equivalence sp p z p gs 0 sp 1 gs 0 sp p z p gs 0 spp 1 gs 0 let f denote the family of nontransitive subgroups of p proposition 47 says that sp p z p gs 0 spp 1 gs 0 g s 1 egf p propositions 54 and 55 say that there are p local equivalences of equivariant classifying spaces egf p bg p bgaff 1 5 1 equivariant classifying spaces the following definition of a g equivariant classifying space is given in 20 definition 45 let be any finite group suppose that f is a collection of subgroups of with the property that if f then every subgroup of and every group conjugate to is in f then we define egf to be the g space with fixed points under any subgroup g egf if f if f when f contains only the trivial group egf is denoted eg this space has a free action of we call bg eg the g equivariant classifying space of example 46 let g be the real regular representation of g rn be the reduced permutation representation of n f denote the family of nontransitive subgroups of n and for any representation v let u v denote the unit sphere of v then lemma 21 implies that u g rn egf specialize the above example to the case n p proposition 47 let f denote the collection of nontransitive subgroups of p the cofiber sp p z p gs 0 sp p 1 z p gs 0 is equivalent to to g s 1 egf p 29 proof let x sv for any g representation v then sp p z p sv sp p 1 z p sv cof sv sv p p cof sv sv p p sv cof s 0 sv r p p sv s 1 u v rp p it therefore suffices for us to prove that u g rp egf it is an easy consequence of lemma 21 that for any subgroup g p u g rp u 0 if p transitive u r otherwise which completes the proof 5 2 p local equivalences and symmetric powers it is well known that the homotopy category of spectra carries a p localization endofunctor lp and for every spectra x there is a map x lpx for our purposes here is the definition of the p localization we need definition 48 a spectrum x is p locally contractible if h x z p 0 a genuine g spectrum x is p locally contractible if hx is p locally contractible for every subgroup h g a map f x y is a p local equivalence if the cofiber is p locally contractible note that for cw complexes with finitely many cells in each dimension a z p homology isomorphism is the same as an fp homology isomorphism proposition 49 let g be a p group the n th layer spn gs 0 spn 1 gs 0 in the symmetric powers of gs 0 is p locally contractible for n 2 3 p 1 proof pick some positive integer and consider the n th layer spn s g spn 1 s g s g n n by induction on the group g it is sufficient to prove that h s g n n g fp 0 2 n since n p there are no nontrivial homomorphisms g n and therefore s g n n g s g n g n s n n as in the notation of lemma 21 let rn denote the reduced standard representation of n then s n n s s r n n 30 since p is relatively prime to the order of n h s s r n n fp h s s r n fp n which is concentrated in degree n and higher since n 2 the result follows 5 3 nontransitive subgroups of p example 46 says that the g p space egf is the space of ordered configurations of p not necessarily distinct points in g whose sum is zero and total length is 1 the subspace consisting of configurations of distinct points carries a free p action and is the g p space eg p in this section we prove that if g is a p group then the inclusion g bg p g egf p is a p local equivalence proposition 54 the proof relies on lemma 53 which establishes a formula for the g fixed points of a quotient space we must first establish two simple lemmas which are used to prove lemma 53 lemma 50 let p be a p cycle and let p be a nontrivial group normalized by then acts transitively on 1 p proof without loss of generality let be the permutation sending 1 7 2 7 3 7 7 p 7 1 suppose that has some nontrivial permutation sending p 7 j then ijj ij sends ij 7 i 1 j for i 1 2 p 1 since is normalized by these permutations ij ij all lie in and so is transitive lemma 51 let g be a p group if f f g p are two distinct maps then the group g p generated by f and f intersects p transitively proof pick some g g such that f g 6 f g and moreover such that f g is not the identity permutation in particular f g must be a p cycle because g is a p group then contains g 1 f g g f g f g 1 f g 6 id hence intersects p nontrivially let p then is normalized by f g because g f g g 1 f g 1 f g f g 1 now using the fact that f g is a p cycle and lemma 50 it follows that is transitive definition 52 20 definition 14 let g and be any finite groups and let h g be a subgroup for any homomorphism f h its graph is the subgroup of h f h f h h h 31 lemma 53 let g be a p group and let x be a g p space for each x x let sx denote the isotropy group of x suppose that for every point x x the intersection sx 1 p is nontransitive then there is a decomposition x p g f g p x f p 5 1 where f varies over all homomorphisms from g to p and f g p denotes the graph of f here a permutation in p takes a point of x f to a point of x f 1 proof let x be a point in the g p space x and let us suppose that the image of x in x p is g fixed this occurs if and only if the projection of sx onto g is surjective we will show that sx contains some graph subgroup let us denote sx 1 p by then the group sx may be thought of as the graph of a homomorphism g ng where ng is the normalizer of in g by assumption is nontransitive if 1 then sx automatically contains a graph subgroup if is nontrivial then by lemma 50 the normalizer ng contains no p cycles therefore the order of the group ng is not divisible by p so there are no nontrivial homomorphisms from g to ng it follows that sx g and therefore sx contains a graph subgroup in either case sx contains some graph subgroup f and thus x x f it follows that x p g f g p x f p all that remains is to show that if f and f are two distinct homomorphisms from g to p then x f and x f are disjoint by the assumption on x it suffices to show that the subgroup of g p which is generated by f and f intersects 1 p transitively this is lemma 51 proposition 54 the inclusion of g spaces eg p p egf p is a p local equivalence on all fixed point spaces proof let x denote the mapping cone of the inclusion eg p egf by induction on the group g it suffices to prove that h x p g fp 0 by lemma 53 x p g f g p x f p but for an arbitrary subgroup g p x if p 1 s 0 if p nontransitive andnonempty if p transitive 32 it therefore follows that x f for any graph subgroup f and so c f g p x f fp is acyclic any point in the pointed p space f g p x f has isotropy group nontransi tive and therefore c f g p x f fp is a projective fp p module it then follows that c f g p x f p fp is acyclic as desired 5 4 equivalence of classifying spaces we prove a proposition analogous to a well known nonequivariant statement namely that the map bgaff 1 bg p is a p local equivalence on all fixed point spaces let g and be groups and let x be a g space for any subgroup let c denote its centralizer in 20 definition 14 the following formula is given x eg g f hom g x f hc imf note that this formula is a special case of equation 5 1 specializing to the case x we deduce that bg g f hom g bc imf 5 2 proposition 55 let g be a p group the g space map bgaff 1 bg p induced by the inclusion aff 1 p is a p local equivalence proof by induction on the group g it suffices to check that the map of g fixed points is an fp homology isomorphism the base case g 1 is equivalent to proving that b baff 1 b p is a mod p homology equivalence this is an immediate consequence of 1 theorem 5 5 let g be any p group by equation 5 2 the map bg g bgaff 1 g bg p g is given by bg g f hom g aff 1 aff 1 bcaff 1 imf f hom g p p bc p imf every nontrivial homomorphism g aff 1 or g p factors through a quotient of g isomor phic to z p so we may assume g z p we now describe conjugacy classes of homomorphisms from z p to each of aff 1 and p the nontrivial homomorphisms f z p aff 1 are all conjugate and each has centralizer equal to im f the trivial homomorphism has centralizer aff 1 33 the nontrivial homomorphisms f z p p are all conjugate and each has centralizer equal to im f the trivial homomorphism has centralizer p thus the map bz p z p bz paff 1 z p bz p p z p is given by bz p z p bz p baff 1 bz p b p the map on the first summand is the identity the map on the second summand is b baff 1 b p which is an fp homology isomorphism 1 theorem 5 5 note just as in the nonequivariant case g bg p is a stable summand of g bgz p with the inclusion map given by the transfer 6 mod p symmetric powers and steinberg summands let g be a p group definition 56 for every n 0 define the genuine g spectrum mg n by mg n s n sp pn z p gs 0 sp pn 1 z p gs 0 when g is the trivial group we simply write m n note that for any i j 0 the product maps on mod p symmetric powers definition 4 give rise to product maps mg i mg j mg i j definition 57 recall from 20 definition 12 that for any pointed g gln space x its steinberg summand enx is the na ve g spectrum enx 1 n b n x gln eggln define the genuine g spectrum enx by promoting enx via definition 15 i e enx i enx we construct an equivalence between the genuine g spectrum mg n and the steinberg summand of the equivariant classifying space bg z p n i e theorem 1 for every integer n 1 there is an equivalence of genuine g spectra mg n enbg z p n 34 we provide the proof here referencing the supporting computational results proven in this section proof proposition 44 states that there is an equivalence of genuine g spectra mg 1 g bgaff 1 because b 1 s 0 it follows immediately from the definitions that there is an equivalence of genuine g spectra e 1 bg z p g bgaff 1 therefore proposition 44 is the n 1 case of theorem 1 namely mg 1 e 1 bgz p 6 1 the proof of theorem 1 relies on the follow diagram enbg z p n e 1 bgz p n mg 1 n mg n 6 2 where the first map is the inclusion of the steinberg summand the middle equivalence is from equation 6 1 and the last map is the product map in diagram 6 2 above we wish to show that the composition is a p local equivalence on all geometric fixed point spectra by induction on the group g it will suffice to check that it is a p local equivalence on g geometric fixed points and this can be checked at the level of fp homology that is we wish to show that the induced map f h g enbg z p n fp h g mg n fp is an isomorphism of graded fp vector spaces this is corollary 71 the proof of corollary 71 may be outlined as follows the geometric fixed point spec tra g enbg z p n and g mg n have been given explicit decompositions discussed in section 6 1 proposition 60 indexed over the subgroups h c thus in section 6 3 we present bases for the two fp vector spaces h g enbg z p n fp and h g mg n fp and the map f all in terms of matrices because the two groups h g enbg z p n fp and h g mg n fp are abstractly isomorphic it suffices to prove that f has trivial kernel which boils down to a linear algebra problem which is done in section 6 2 corollary 65 6 1 h summands let g be a p group and let c denote the poset of subgroups h e g such that g h is an elementary abelian p group definition 28 definition 58 for every h c let d h denote the rank of g h as an fp vector space note that two subgroups h k c are transverse definition 36 if and only if d h d k d h k 35 proposition 20 implies that for every n 1 there is an equivalence of spectra gspnz p gs 0 h c sp n pd h z p s 0 prg h s g which is suitably compatible with the inclusions spn 1 spn taking n pn we immediately deduce the formula gmg n h c mg n d h d h prg h s g h c mg n d h 1 d h p g h b g h 6 3 definition 59 let n be a positive integer and h c be a subgroup of g the spectrum mg n h m n d h d h prg h s g is called the h summand of gmg n for any two positive integers m n and subgroups h k c there is a product map mg m h mg n k mg m n h k which is determined by the product maps gmg m gmg n gmg m n proposition 60 let g be a p group and let n be any positive integer for every subgroup h c there is an equivalence of h summand spectra mg n h en h 6 4 where en h is the h summand of the fixed point spectrum enbg z p n g 20 definition 20 let m n be positive integers and suppose that h k c are transverse then there is a commutative diagram mg m h mg n k mg m n h k em h en k em n h k where the rows are the products on summands and the columns are the equivalences just described 36 proof by proposition 35 prg h s g p g h b g h when g h is elementary abelian the subgroup complex p g h is identical to the flag complex of the fp vector space g h z p d h by 18 theorem a the layer m n d h is p locally equivalent to en d h b z p n d h thus mg n h m n d h d h prg h s g en d h b z p n d h 1 d h b d h b g h en h when h and k are transverse the subgroup complex product definition 38 is identical to the flag complex product 20 above proposition 10 therefore by combining proposition 39 with 20 proposition 21 we deduce that the equivalence d h prg h s g 1 d h b n d h b g h respects the products on both sides the equivalence m n d h en d h b z p n d h constructed in 18 theorem a was built so as to respect the product structures on both sides therefore the equivalence mg n h en h respects the product structures on both sides we note the following corollary corollary 61 there is an equivalence of spectra gmg n enbg z p n g proof combine equation 6 4 equation 6 3 and 20 definition 20 6 2 matrices with transverse row nullspaces definition 62 let n r 0 be nonnegative integers then we write matn r hom z p r z p n for the set of n r matrices with entries in the field fp for each subspace v z p r let matn r v matn r denote the set of n r matrices with nullspace v definition 63 let t matn r denote the set of n r matrices with the following property if a matrix a t has exactly k nonzero rows for some k then those nonzero row vectors are linearly independent let t v matn r v denote the intersection t v t matn r v the set t v is equivalently characterized as the set of n r matrices with nullspace v and exactly s nonzero rows where dim v r s the gln set matn r decomposes as matn r v z p r matn r v 37 fix a subspace v z p r and write dim v r s our goal in this section is to prove the proposition 64 below proposition 64 let d be any finite dimensional fp gln module let a denote the fp gln module a matn r v d the composition ena a projt v a en ena is a monomorphism of fp vector spaces therefore because the source and target have the same dimension the composition above is an isomorphism before we discuss the proof of proposition 64 we record a corollary which is used in the proof of corollary 71 and thus of theorem 1 corollary 65 let d denote the fp gln module d h b z p n fp the following com position is an isomorphism en matn r d e n 1 matn r d projt e n 1 matn r d en matn r d proof the decomposition matn r v z p r matn r v is gln equivariant so it suffices to prove the same statement with matn r replaced by matn r v next we observe that the following diagram commutes en matn r d s matn r d projt matn r d en matn r d e n 1 matn r d projt oo e n 1 matn r d 99 ssssssssss oo now the proof statement is an immediate corollary of 20 proposition 64 we now prove proposition 64 we need some notation and lemmas definition 66 let t v denote the subset of matrices whose last s rows are nonzero let n be the free fp gln module n matn r v fp gln associated to the subsets t v matn r v are endomorphisms projt v and proj of the vector space n such that projt v proj proj proj projt v 38 recall from 20 section 1 that bn resp n denotes the group of invertible n n upper triangular matrices resp permutation matrices the elements bn and n of the group algebra z p gln define endomorphisms of the fp gln module n the conjugate steinberg idempotent e n is the element of the group ring z p gln defined by e n 1 cn bn n where cn z p let bn s bs bn resp n s s denote the set of upper triangular matrices resp permutation matrices whose ij th entry is zero whenever 1 i n s and n s 1 j n let e n s e s fp gln denote the image of the idempotent element e n s e s fp gln s fp fp gls under the block inclusion lemma 67 the following two endomorphisms of n as an fp vector space are equal proj bn projt v bn s bs proj proof let a be an n r matrix in t v and let b be an n n invertible upper triangular matrix then ba b bn s bs and a it immediately follows that proj bn projt v proj bn s bs projt v the set is preserved by the group gln s gls and so it follows that proj bn s bs projt v bn s bs proj projt v bn s bs proj lemma 68 the composition e nn n proj n is a monomorphism of fp vector spaces proof for any sub fp vector space l n we write proj l to denote the image of l under the endomorphism proj there is an inclusion of fp vector spaces proj e nn proj e n s e s n we will prove that these two vector spaces are equal because the set matn r v is preserved by the subgroup gln s gls gln it follows that proj e n s e s n proj proj e n s e s n proj e n s e s proj n therefore the fp vector space proj e n s e s n is spanned by elements of the form proj e n s e s a x a x gln 39 pick such an element let b be any element of the group of block upper triangular matrices bn s bs then for every n we have b a n s s therefore it follows that proj n s s bn s bs a x proj n bn s bs a x now let b be any element of the group bn such that b bn s bs then it follows that b a t v so for any permutation matrix n we have b a t v in particular b a therefore proj n bn s bs a x proj n bn a x proj e n a x we therefore conclude that proj e n s e s n proj e nn and therefore the two fp vector spaces above are equal we now prove that dimfp e nn dimfp proj e n s e s n from this fact we will con clude that e nn and proj e nn have the same dimension as fp vector spaces which completes the proof because n matn r v fp gln is a free fp gln module we calculate dimfp e nn dimfp enn dimfp stn gln n dimfp stn matn r v p n 2 s 1 i 0 pn pi because proj n fp gln is a free fp gln s gls module we calculate dimfp proj e n s e s n dimfp e n s e s proj n dimfp stn s sts gln gln s gls dimfp stn s sts gls gln gln s gls p n s 2 s 2 n 1 i 0 pn pi n s 1 i 0 pn s pi it is routine to check that the two boxed expressions are equal 40 proof of proposition 64 any such d receives a surjective map from a finite dimensional free fp gln module therefore it suffices to consider the case d fp gln in this case a is equal to the module n matn r v fp gln defined earlier let x n be any element such that enx is nonzero we wish to prove that en projt v enx is nonzero we will prove that proj en projt v enx is nonzero proj en projt v enx proj bn nprojt v bn nx proj bnprojt v nbn nx t v is n invariant bn s bsproj nbn nx lemma 3 3 recall from that for any z p gln module m the linear operators bn e nm enmll n are inverse isomorphisms therefore because the element enx bn nx was assumed to be nonzero it follows that the element nbn nx is nonzero therefore by lemma 3 2 the element proj nbn nx is nonzero the conjugate steinberg idempotent e n can be written in the form e n e n s e s un s s shuf n s s it therefore follows that the summand e nn nbnn is a sub fp vector space of e n s e s n therefore the element nbn nx is an element of the vector space e n s e s n the set is preserved by the group gln s gls and so it follows that the endomorphisms proj and e n s e s commute therefore proj nbn nx lies in the vector space e n s e s n the linear operator bn s bs e n s e s n en s es n is an isomorphism therefore because proj nbn nx is a nonzero element of the vector space e n s e s n we conclude that bn s bsproj nbn nx is nonzero as desired 6 3 proof of theorem 1 let g be a p group and let n i be positive integers such that n i for any pointed g gln space x there are inclusions and projections of steinberg summands as defined in 20 sections 2 2 and 2 3 enx ei en i x and ei en i x enx we thus obtain an inclusion of na ve g spectra enx e n 1 x we now specialize to the case where x is the g equivariant classifying space with a disjoint basepoint x bg z p n in this situation the fixed point spectrum enbg z p n g was given a complete description in 20 section 4 2 we express that description in terms of matrices for the purposes of our computation 41 definition 69 let g be a finite p group we denote by f the minimal subgroup of g such that g f is elementary abelian we let r denote the rank of g f and we fix an isomorphism g f z p r the subgroups h c are in bijective correspondence with linear subspaces v z p r and we let cd v denote the codimension of v thus enbg z p n g en hom g z p n b z p n en matn r b z p n 6 5 there is an equivalence of gl 1 gl 1 sets given by using the i th input row vector as the i th row of the output matrix for i 1 2 n mat 1 r mat 1 r matn r then the steinberg inclusion enbg z p n g e n 1 bg z p n g is described by the inclusion of steinberg summands en matn r b z p n e 1 matn r b z p n e 1 mat 1 r b z p n expressed on the level of homology the map h g enbg z p n fp h g e 1 bg z p n fp is given by the inclusion en matn r h b z p n fp e 1 matn r h b z p n fp 6 6 the product h gmg 1 n h gmg n can also be described in this language by proposition 44 h gmg 1 n h g e n 1 bg z p n fp e 1 matn r h b z p n fp 6 7 and by corollary 61 h gmg n h g enbg z p n fp en matn r h b z p n fp 6 8 proposition 70 under the isomorphisms of equations 6 7 and 6 8 the product h gmg 1 n h gmg n on the layers in the mod p symmetric powers is given by the composition e n 1 matn r h b z p n fp projt e n 1 matn r h b z p n fp en matn r h b z p n fp 42 proof the gl 1 set mat 1 r is a disjoint union mat 1 r v z p r mat 1 r v where mat 1 r v is the set of r dimensional row vector with nullspace v note that mat 1 r v is empty unless v has codimension 0 or 1 let h 1 hn c and let v 1 vn z p r be the associated subspaces there is an isomorphism by using the i th input row vector as the i th row of the output matrix for i 1 2 n v 1 vn z p r mat 1 r v 1 mat 1 r vn v z p r matn r v which maps mat 1 r v 1 mat 1 r vn matn r v 1 vn observe that collection of codimension 0 or 1 subgroups h 1 hn c are transverse definition 36 if and only if the matrices coming from this map are in t definition 63 let h c and let v z p r be the associated linear subspace under the isomorphism g f z p r by the definition of the spectrum en h 20 definition 20 h en h fp en hom g h z p n h b z p n fp en matn r v h b z p n fp under the isomorphism of equation 6 5 the product of h summands in the steinberg projection h g e n 1 bg z p n h g enbg z p n namely n i 1 h e 1 hi fp h en h 1 hn fp 6 9 is given by n i 1 e 1 mat 1 r vi h bz p fp en matn r v 1 vn h b z p n fp let h 1 hn c be subgroups the product h gmg 1 n fp h gmg n fp can be described in terms of the maps on h summands definition 59 n i 1 h mg 1 hi fp h mg n h 1 hn 6 10 note that mg 1 hi 0 if d h 2 if the subgroups h 1 hn are transverse then by proposition 60 the map of equation 6 10 is given by equation 6 9 if the subgroups h 1 hn are nontransverse then by proposition 43 the the map of equation 6 10 is zero 43 corollary 71 the composition enbg z p n e 1 bg z p n mg 1 n mg n is an isomorphism after applying the functor h g fp proof equation 6 6 gives us a description of the first map and proposition 70 gives us a description of the second map now apply corollary 65 7 splitting of the filtration recall from section 2 6 that the mod p symmetric powers of the equivariant sphere spectrum are a filtration for the equivariant eilenberg maclane spectrum of fp written below are only the stages at powers of p gs 0 sp 1 gs 0 spp gs 0 spp 2 gs 0 sp gs 0 hfp in this section we give a short proof of theorem 2 theorem 2 let g be any finite p group the filtration sp pn z p gs 0 n 0 splits into its layers after smashing with hfp that is there is an equivalence of hfp modules hfp hfp n 0 hfp n enbg z p n first we need a lemma lemma 72 the inclusion gs 0 sp p z p gs 0 has a retraction after smashing with hfp namely gs 0 hfp sp p z p gs 0 hfp rr proof the composition gs 0 sp p z p gs 0 sp z p gs 0 hfp is the unit map therefore after smashing with hfp and composing with the product map hfp hfp hfp we have the commutative diagram gs 0 hfp id sp p z p gs 0 hfp hfp hfp hfp the dotted map provides the splitting 44 now theorem 2 is an immediate corollary of the following proposition proposition 1 there is a monomorphism dotted which splits the cofiber sequence shown hfp sp pn 1 z p gs 0 hfp sp pn z p gs 0 hfp sp pn z p gs 0 sp pn 1 z p gs 0 qq proof let t 1 denote the retraction map of lemma 72 i e sp p z p gs 0 hfp sp p z p gs 0 sp 1 z p gs 0 hfp t 1 qq define the map tn by the composite in the top half of the diagram of hfp module spectra below sp pn z p gs 0 sp pn 1 z p gs 0 hfp tn nenbg z p n hfp e 1 bgz p n hfp t n 1 sp pn z p gs 0 hfp sp p z p gs 0 n hfp oo sp pn z p gs 0 sp pn 1 z p gs 0 hfp sp pn z p gs 0 hfp oo since t 1 is a retraction it follows that the composite map nenbg z p n hfp sp pn z p gs 0 sp pn 1 z p gs 0 hfp along the right and bottom of the commutative diagram is an equivalence therefore by commutativity the composite along the left side of the diagram is an equivalence and so tn is a retraction references 1 a adem j milgram cohomology of finite groups springer verlag grundlehren 309 2004 2 g arone w dwyer
