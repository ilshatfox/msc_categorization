my title ar x iv 1 80 9 08 92 1 v 3 m at h a t 1 d ec 2 01 8 almost global homotopy theory zhen huan abstract in this paper we develop the definition of a global orthogonal spec trum and its unitary version it relates g equivariant spectra by equivariant weak equivalence in a coherent way this category of global spectra has a model structure quillen equivalent to the global model structure on orthog onal spectra we also show that there is a large family of equivariant coho mology theories including quasi elliptic cohomology that can be globalized in the new context starting from one global ring spectrum we can construct infinitely many distinct global ring spectra moreover in light of the results in this paper we ask whether we have the conjecture that the globalness of a cohomology theory is completely determined by the formal component of its divisible group and when the e tale component of it varies the globalness does not change 1 introduction equivariant stable homotopy theory is the homotopy theory of topological spaces with group actions invented by g b segal in the early 1970 s 21 equi variant stable homotopy theory was motivated by atiyah and segal s work 3 on equivariant k theory the foundation of it was established systematically by tom dieck segal and may afterwards during the last decades this area has been very active equivariant stable homotopy theory has shown great power solving compu tational and conceptual problems in algebraic and geometric topology in addition even early in the history of equivariant stable homotopy theory people noticed that many equivariant homotopy theories exist not only for one particular group but for a family of groups in a uniform way and as equivariant k theories there are relations between equivariant homotopy theories for different groups such as the connections embodied in the restriction maps transfer maps etc these ob servations led to the birth of global homotopy theory globalness is a measure of the naturalness of a cohomology theory prominent examples of global homotopy theory include global k theory global bordism theory and global stable homotopy theory orthogonal spectrum is a good model to interpret global spectrum which re flects most symmetry the idea of global orthogonal spectra was first inspired in greenlees and may 11 several models of global homotopy theory have been es tablished which are equivalent to each other schwede develops a modern approach 2010 mathematics subject classification primary 55 the author was partially supported by nsf grant dms 1406121 1 http arxiv org abs 1809 08921 v 3 2 zhen huan to global homotopy theory in 20 in 5 bohmann uses the framework of enriched indexed categories to develop the definition of a global orthogonal spectrum she shows that the atiyah bott shapiro orientation can extend to this global context gepner and henriques establish the basic theory of an unstable global homotopy theory in 9 via infinity categories the underlying infinity category is equivalent to that of schwede s orthogonal spaces this theory is much easier to work with for elliptic cohomology the motivating example for almost global homotopy theory is quasi elliptic cohomology 18 14 15 this theory is a variant of elliptic cohomology theories it is the orbifold k theory of a space of constant loops for global quotient orbifolds it can be expressed in terms of equivariant k theories and has the change of group isomorphisms in a conversation ganter indicated that it has better chances than grojnowski equivariant elliptic cohomology theory to be put together naturally in a uniform way and made into an ultra commutative global cohomology theory in the sense of schwede 20 however though many constructions on quasi elliptic cohomology can be made in a neat way there is not an effective way to prove or disprove this statement we construct in 13 an orthogonal g spectrum of quasi elliptic cohomology for each compact lie group g as indicated in remark 6 13 13 these equivariant orthogonal spectra cannot arise from an orthogonal spectrum then it is even more difficult to see whether each elliptic cohomology theory whose form is more intricate and mysterious than quasi elliptic cohomology can be globalized in the current setting in this paper we construct a new theory almost global homotopy theory we observe that if the equivariant cohomology theories e g g have the change of group isomorphisms and there exists an orthogonal g spectrum xg representinge g then for any closed subgrouph ofg and anyg representation v we have a weak h equivalence xg v h xh v in light of this observa tion we combine the equivariant orthogonal spectra of e g g by equivariant weak equivalences to give the definition of a global spectrum the category spd 0 w definition 3 6 of the resulting global spectra has a model structure on it quillen equivalent to the global model structure on orthogonal spectra constructed in the orem 4 3 17 20 other than quasi elliptic cohomology there is a large family of equivariant cohomology theories that can extend to the new context of global spectra in 16 we define quasi theories they are motivated by quasi elliptic cohomology whose divisible group is given by the tate curve tate q section 2 6 1 starting from a cohomology theory e we can construct a family of theories qe n g for any positive integer n and any compact lie group g quasi elliptic cohomology the n th generalized quasi elliptic cohomology and the theories qe in 13 are all quasi theories quasi theories qe n g g have the change of group isomorphism if the ini tial theory e g g does as shown in 16 in 17 we construct an orthogonal g spectrum for each quasi theory the construction generalizes that for quasi elliptic cohomology in 13 the equivariant orthogonal spectra for each quasi theory cannot arise from an orthogonal spectrum but do form a global spectra in the almost global homotopy theory in this paper we construct almost global homotopy theory and several model structures on the underlying category in addition we construct global spectra for almost global homotopy theory 3 quasi theories in the new setting in section 2 we construct the new diagram cate gory d 0 by adding restriction maps between group representations to the category l of inner product vector spaces in section 3 we introduce the category spd 0 w of global spectra which is a full subcategory of the category ofd 0 spectra moreover we introduce the unitary version of it in section 4 we describe the global model structure on spd 0 w and show it is quillen equivalent to the global model structure on orthogonal spectra in theorem 4 3 18 20 in section 5 for any global family f we introduce a category sp d f 0 w of global spectra and show that if f is the global family of finite groups there is a model structure on sp d f 0 w quillen equivalent to the f global model structure on orthogonal spectra in theorem 4 3 17 20 in addition we describe roughly the reedy model structure on sp d f 0 w constructed in section 6 4 14 in section 6 we show quasi theories have global version in this new context at the end of the paper in remark 6 11 we raise the question whether the e tale component in the divisible group associated to a cohomology theory plays no role in the globalization of the theory 1 1 acknowledgement first i would like to thank my phd advisor charles rezk the main idea of this paper is motivated by him i would also like to thank matthew ando for his support and encouragement all the time i would like to thank stefan schwede for helpful conversation at homotopy theory summer berlin in june 2018 and a few email discussions i would like to thank david gepner and nathaniel stapleton for helpful conversations 2 the categories d 0 and d c 0 in this section we introduce the new diagrams d 0 and d c 0 2 1 the category d 0 definition 2 1 let d be a category with objects g v where v is an inner product vector space g a compact group g and a faithful group representations g o v a morphism in d 1 2 g v h w consists of a linear isometric embedding 2 v w and a group homomorphism 1 1 o 2 v g which make the diagram commute 2 1 g o v 2 1 o 2 v 1 oo o w in other words the group action of h on 2 v is induced from that of g the composition of two morphisms g v 1 2 h w 1 2 k u is defined to be 1 1 1 o 2 2 v 2 2 4 zhen huan the composition is associative the identity morphism in d g v g v is id id all the maps in 2 1 are injective given a linear isometric embedding 2 v w 1 2 g is always nonempty since the identity element is in it if 1 exists it is unique lemma 2 2 two objects g v and h w in d are isomorphic if and only if there is an isomorphism g h which makes v and w isomorphic as representations the proof is left to the readers remark 2 3 this category d has the same objects as the category ig de fined in example 2 3 5 from which bohmann constructed a version of global spectra however the sets of morphisms in the two categories are very different roughly speaking d has the same restriction maps as ig and less linear isometric embeddings than ig in addition there is no obvious structure of enriched indexed category on d remark 2 4 since the representation in an object g v of d is faithful we may consider the group g as a closed subgroup of o v then the diagram 2 1 is equivalent to 2 2 g o v h o v oo o w where we consider o v as a closed subgroup of o w as well all the maps in the diagram are inclusions in section 6 1 14 we discuss the topology on the space d g v h w of morphisms in addition the space d g v h w of morphisms inherits an h action and g action on it for 1 2 g v h w and g h g h 2 3 g h 1 2 g 1 h 1 h g 1 h 2 g 1 the h action on 2 is left and the g action on it is right whereas the h action on 1 is right and the g action on 1 is left proposition 2 5 the category d is a symmetric monoidal category proof the tensor product d d d is defined by 2 4 g v h w 7 g h v w the unit object is u e 0 where e is the trivial group and is the unique map from e from the property of product of representations the tensor product is associative and we have the isomorphism g h v w h g w v it s straightforward to check it satisfies all the required diagrams almost global homotopy theory 5 note that each object g v is isomorphic to g v i ind with i g o v the inclusion of closed subgroup let d 0 denote the full subcategory of d consisting of objects g v i with g a closed subgroup of o v and i the inclusion d 0 is equivalent to d we will not lose any information if we study d 0 instead of d we use g v to denote g v i in the rest of the paper next we introduce two types of morphisms in d 0 the restriction maps and the linear isometric embeddings definition 2 6 a morphism 1 2 g v h w in d 0 is called a restriction map if 2 is an isomorphism definition 2 7 a morphism 1 2 g v h w in d 0 is called a linear isometric embedding if 1 is an isomorphism proposition 2 8 each morphism 1 2 g v h w in d 0 is the composition of a restriction map and a linear isometric embedding up to isomorphisms proof any morphism 1 2 g v h w has the decomposition 2 5 g v i id 1 h o 2 v v 1 2 h w where i 1 h o 2 v g is the inclusion note that in the second morphism 1 2 1 h o 2 v 1 h o 2 v is a group isomorphism if 1 2 f 1 f 2 1 2 with 1 2 g v g v a restriction map and f 1 f 2 g v h w a linear isometric embedding 2 v v is an isometric isomorphism and f 1 h o f 2 v g is a group isomorphism the group homomorphisms 1 resp f 1 is uniquely determined by 2 resp f 2 note that o f 2 v h o 2 v h we have the commutative diagram below 1 h o 2 v o v 2 g 1 f 1 1 oo o v so we have the isomorphism 1 f 1 1 2 1 h o 2 v v g v the morphism i id g v 1 h o 2 v v equals to the composition 1 f 1 1 2 1 1 2 and 1 2 1 h o 2 v v h w is the composition f 1 f 2 1 f 1 1 2 so the decomposition 2 5 is unique up to isomorphism 2 2 the category dc moreover we can define the unitary version of d and d 0 let w be a complex inner product space i e a finite dimensional c vector space equipped with a hermitian inner product let rw denote the underly ing real inner product spaces of w i e the underlying finite dimensional r vector space equipped with the euclidean inner product v w re v w 6 zhen huan let c gal c r idc denote the galois groups of c over r where c c is the complex conjugation first we recall some constructions from 20 definition 2 9 lc is the complex isometries category whose objects are finite dimensional complex inner product spaces and morphism space between two objects v and w is the space of the pairs l rv rw c that satisfy v v and v v v v the composition in lc is defined by and the identity morphism of v is idv idc the extra piece of the unitary structure gives a richer global homotopy theory that is indexed not only on compact lie groups but on the larger class of augmented lie groups definition 2 10 an augmented lie group is a compact lie group g equipped with a continuous homomorphism g c called the augmentation to the galois group of c over r let gev 1 idc denote the even part of g and godd 1 the odd part of g the product in the category of augmented lie groups is defined to be the fiber product over c explicitly the product of two augmented lie groups g and k is the augmented lie group g c k with g c k ev gev kev and g c k odd godd kodd example 2 11 extended unitary group the endomorphism group of a com plex inner product space w in the category lc is defined to be u w lc w w the augmentation w u w c is defined to be w c c the extended unitary group is a closed subgroup of o rw the augmented lie group contain compact lie groups as the ones with trivial augmentation it also contain the real lie groups of atiyah and segal in 3 which are defined as compact lie groups equipped with an involution example 2 12 split augmented lie groups let g be a compact lie group equipped with an involution g g on it namely a real lie group in the sense of 2 we can construct an augmented lie group from it the semi direct product g c is an augmented lie group with the augmentation g c c g 7 a real representation of g c amounts to a unitary representation v of g with a real structure v v such that g v g v g g v v almost global homotopy theory 7 for the opposite direction given an augmented lie group it is isomorphic to a g c for some real lie groupg if and only if its augmentation has a multiplicative section i e it has an odd element of order 2 for any complex inner product space w there is a canonical involution on u w by complex conjugation we have the isomorphism of augmented lie groups 2 6 u w c u w 7 w definition 2 13 a real representation of an augmented lie group g is a finite dimensional complex inner product space v and a continuous homomorphism g u v i e such that v definition 2 14 let g be an augmented lie group an augmented right g space is a right g space a equipped with a continuous map a c such that a g a g for all a a and all g g definition 2 15 a unitary space is a continuous functor from the complex isometries category lc to the category of spaces where lc is the category in definition 2 9 a morphism of unitary spaces is a natural transformation of functors we denote the category of unitary spaces by spcu definition 2 16 dc is the category whose objects are g v with g an aug mented lie group and v a faithful real representation of g and the morphism space dc g v h w is the space of the pairs 1 2 with 2 l c v w and 1 1 u 2 v g g a group homomorphism which make the dia gram commute 2 7 g u v 2 1 u 2 v 1 oo u w in other words the action of the augmented lie group h on 2 v is induced from that of g proposition 2 17 the category dc is a symmetric monoidal category proof let g v and h w be two objects in dc the tensor product of g v and h w is defined to be g c h v w c the product is obviously associative and commutative the unit is 1 1 where 1 is the trivial group equipped with the trivial augmentation definition 2 18 the category dc 0 is defined to be the full subcategory of d c consisting of objects g v with g a closed subgroup of u v it is equivalent to dc as categories 8 zhen huan 3 the category spd 0 w in this section we define the category spd 0 w of global spectra that we will work in at the end of this section we introduce the unitary version of it we implicitly add disjoint basepoints to the morphism spaces in d 0 definition 3 1 the category d 0 t a d 0 space is a continuous functor x d 0 t to the category of based compactly generated weak hausdorff spaces a morphism of d 0 spaces is a natural transformation we use d 0 t to denote the category of d 0 spaces example 3 2 we can define the d 0 sphere for each object g v in d define 3 1 s g v sv sv inherits a g action from that on v for any morphism 1 2 g v h w in d 0 define s to be 3 2 s 2 sv sw in particular s id is the identity map definition 3 3 the category spd 0 a d 0 spectrum x consists of a based g space x g v a based structure map g v h w s w x g v x g h v w which is g h equivariant for any objects g v and h w of d 0 in addition g v 1 0 is the identity map and g v h 1 h 2 w 1 w 2 g h 1 v w 1 h 2 w 2 s w 2 g v h 1 w 1 a morphism of d 0 spectra f x y is a functor in d 0 t compatible with the structure maps i e for any objects g v and h w in d 0 f g h v w x g v h w y g v h w f g v sw we use spd 0 to denote the category of d 0 spectra remark 3 4 a d 0 spectrum can be interpreted as a diagram spectrum first we give the structure maps a topology let g v and h w be two objects in d 0 over the space d 0 g v h w of morphisms we define a vector bundle with total space g v h w w 1 2 w d 0 g v h w w 2 v and with the structure map g v h w d 0 g v h w the projec tion to the second factor let o g v h w denote the thom space of this bundle we have 3 3 o g v h w v w d 0 g v h w a d 0 spectrum is a continuous based functor from o to the category t of based compactly generated weak hausdorff spaces to study equivariant homotopy theory a more interesting and reasonable cat egory is defined below almost global homotopy theory 9 definition 3 5 the category d 0 t w define d 0 t w to be the full category of d 0 t consisting of those objects x d 0 t that maps each restriction map g v h v to an h weak equivalence we call the objects dw 0 spaces definition 3 6 the category spd 0 w adw 0 spectrumx is both ad 0 spectrum and a d 0 space in d 0 t w the category spd 0 w is the full subcategory of spd 0 con sisting of dw 0 spectra we recall the definition of orthogonal spectra definition 3 7 the category spo of orthogonal spectra an orthogonal spectrum consists of the following data a sequence of pointed spaces xn for n 0 a base point preserving continuous left action of the orthogonal group o n on xn for each n 0 based maps n xn s 1 xn 1 for n 0 this data is subject to the following condition for all n m 0 the iterated structure map m xn s m xn m is o n o m equivariant we use spo to denote the category of orthogonal spectra since d 0 is a topological category sp d 0 is complete and cocomplete lemma 3 8 spd 0 w is both complete and cocomplete proof we first show that spd 0 w is complete let j be a small category and f j spd 0 w be a diagram since spd 0 is complete the diagram f j spd 0 w has a limit x in sp d 0 let r g v h v be a restriction map let ev g v sp d 0 w t be the evaluation map sending x to x g v then we have diagrams ev g v f j t and ev h v f j t the limits of them are x g v and x h v respectively for each integer n we have the equivariant homotopy groups hn the diagrams hn ev g v f and h n ev h v f are isomorphic so we have isomorphic limits hn x g v h n x h v for each n thus x g v and x h v are h weak equivalent so x is an object in spd 0 w we can prove that spd 0 w is cocomplete in a similar way we have a pair of adjoint functors between spd 0 w and the category sp o of orthogonal spaces in section 6 1 14 we discuss a functor l l d sending rn to o n rn it gives a forgetful functor u spd 0 spo let q spd 0 w sp d 0 spo 10 zhen huan denote the composition of the inclusion and the forgetful functor u in addition we can define a functor p spo spd 0 w by sending an orthogonal spectrum y to the dw 0 spectrum 3 4 p y g v y v p y 1 2 y 2 for any object g v and any morphism 1 2 in d 0 proposition 3 9 p q spo q p spd 0 w is a pair of adjoint functors in addition the unit idx q p is an isomor phism proof let x be an object in spo and y an object in spd 0 w we can define a natural isomorphism f homspo q homspd 0 w p for any functor f x q y let f f g v p x g v y g v be defined by the composition 3 5 p x o v v f v y o v v y i id p x g v y g v for any object g v of d 0 in addition we can define hom sp d 0 w p homspo q for any functor p x y define v o v v is the inverse of f the composition q p is the identity so is an isomorphism remark 3 10 the adjoint functors p q are not equivalences p is full and faithful but it is not essentially surjective example 3 11 each orthogonal spectrum y gives a dw 0 spectrum qy we can also define the equivariant homotopy groups of dw 0 spectrum definition 3 12 for each dw 0 spectrum y 3 6 gk y g k q y for any compact lie group g and any positive integer k remark 3 13 note that for any dw 0 spectrum each restriction map in d 0 is mapped to an equivariant weak equivalence thus the definition in 3 6 contains all the necessary information in addition we can define the equivariant homotopy groups of dw 0 spectrum in the canonical way as those of orthogonal spectra we describe the construc tion explicitly let s ug denote the poset under inclusion of finite dimensional g subrepresentations of the chosen complete g universe ug let x denote a dw 0 spectrum y if id 2 g v g w is a morphism in d 0 and f sv x g v a continuous based map we define f s w x g w as the composite f s w sv sw 2 v f s w 2 v x g v sw 2 v 2 x g w almost global homotopy theory 11 we obtain a functor from the poset s ug to sets by sending v s ug to sv x g v g the set of g equivariant homotopy classes of based g maps from sv to x g v for v w in s ug the inclusion i v w is sent to the map sv x g v g sw x g w g f 7 i f the 0 th equivariant homotopy group g 0 x is then defined as g 0 x colimv s ug s v x g v g let k be a positive integer define gk x colimv s ug s v r k x g v g 3 7 g k x colimv s ug s v x g v rk g 3 8 moreover we define and study the unitary version of spd 0 w definition 3 14 a dc 0 space is a continuous functor from the category d c 0 to the category of spaces a morphism of dc 0 spaces is a natural transformation of functors we denote the category of dc 0 spaces by d c 0 t dc 0 spectra are the stabilization of d c 0 spaces definition 3 15 the category sp d 0 u w a d c w 0 spectrum x is both a dc 0 spectrum and a d c 0 space in d c 0 t w the category sp d 0 u w is the full subcat egory of spd u consisting of dc w spectra 4 global model structure in this section we will lift the model structures on orthogonal spectra in 20 to spd 0 w the transfer theorem that we will use is theorem 5 1 chapter ii 10 we recall it below theorem 4 1 let f g c g f d be an adjoint pair and suppose c is a cofibrantly generated model category let i and j be chosen sets of generating cofibrations and acyclic cofibrations respectively define a morphism f x y in d to be a weak equivalence or a fibration if gf is a weak equivalence or fibration in c suppose further that 1 the right adjoint g d c commutes with sequential colimits and 2 every cofibration in d with the left lifting property with respect to all fibra tions is a weak equivalence then d becomes a cofibrantly generated model category furthermore the sets fi i i and fj j j generate the cofibrations and the acyclic cofribrations of d respectively we describe a strong level model structure on spd 0 w 12 zhen huan definition 4 2 a map f x y in spd 0 w is called a strong level equivalence if q f is a strong level equivalence in the category of orthogonal spectra i e for each nonnegative integer n and each closed subgroup h of o n x o n rn h y o n rn h is a weak equivalence strong level fibration if q f is a strong level fibration in the category of or thogonal spectra i e for each nonnegative integer n x o n rn y o n rn is a o n fibration strong level cofibration if it is a morphism with the left lifting property with respect to all acyclic strong level fibrations proposition 4 3 the strong level equivalences strong level fibrations and the strong level cofibrations form a model structure the strong level model structure on spd 0 w it is cofibrantly generated it is quillen equivalent the strong level model structure on orthogonal spectra in proposition 4 3 7 20 proof since q is the forgetful functor between diagram spectra it commutes with colimits since all the spaces are fibrant all the objects in spo are fibrant in the strong level model structure the terminal object in spd 0 w is the constant d w 0 spectra y is a fibrant object in spd 0 w if and only if q y is fibrant in sp o the fibrant replacement functor in spd 0 w is the identity functor in addition spd 0 w has functorial path objects for each object y y i is defined by 4 1 y i g v y g v i since the strong level model structure on orthogonal spectra is cofibrantly gen erated by theorem 4 1 the strong level equivalences strong level fibrations and the strong level cofibrations form a model structure which is cofibrantly generated we also describe a global model structure on spd 0 w definition 4 4 a map f x y in spd 0 w is called a global equivalence if q f is a global equivalence in the category of orthogonal spectra i e for each nonnegative integer n and each closed subgroup h of o n gk f g k x g k y is a weak equivalence where g k is the equivariant homotopy groups in definition 3 12 global fibration if q f is a global fibration in the category of orthogonal spectra i e f is strong level fibration and for each object d o v v b o w w of d any closed subgroup g of both o v and o w the square 4 2 x d g f d g d b mapg sw x g v w mapg sw f g v w y d g d b mapg sw y g v w is a homotopy cartesian global cofibration if it is a morphism with the left lifting property with respect to all acyclic global fibrations theorem 4 5 the global equivalences global fibrations and global cofibrations form a model structure the strong level model structure on spwd it is cofibrantly almost global homotopy theory 13 generated it is quillen equivalent the global model structure on orthogonal spectra in theorem 4 3 18 in 20 proof since q is the forgetful functor between diagram spectra it commutes with colimits an object y in spd 0 w is fibrant if and only if q y is fibrant in the global model structure of spo let r denote the fibrant replacement functor in spo then the functor 4 3 y 7 p r qy is the fibrant replacement functor in spd 0 w note that since q p is the identity functor r qy is fibrant if and only if p r qy is fibrant in addition spd 0 w has functorial path objects for fibrant objects since the global model structure on orthogonal spectra is cofibrantly generated by theorem 4 1 the global equivalences global fibrations and global cofibrations form a model structure which is cofibrantly generated 5 f global model structure next we show our thoughts on the lift of f global model structure with f a global family of compact lie groups i e a non empty class of compact lie groups that is closed under isomorphisms closed subgroups and quotient groups definition 5 1 let df 0 denote the full subcategory of d 0 with objects g v with g f we use the symbol df 0 t to denote the category of d f 0 spaces and sp d f 0 to denote the category of df 0 spectra definition 5 2 the category df 0 t w define df 0 t w to be the full category of df 0 t consisting of those objects x d f 0 t that maps each restriction map g v h v to an h weak equivalence we call the objects d f w 0 spaces definition 5 3 the category sp d f 0 w ad f w 0 spectrumx is both ad f 0 spectrum and a d f w 0 space the category sp d f 0 w is the full subcategory of sp d f 0 consisting of d f w 0 spectra we have the question whether there is a model structure on sp d f 0 w quillen equivalent to that f global model structure on orthogonal spectra in theorem 4 3 17 20 below we show that when f consists of finite groups we have a global model structure on sp d f 0 w we have a pair of adjoint functors between sp d f 0 w and sp o we have a functor lf l d f 0 sending rn to n r n it gives a forgetful functor uf sp d f 0 spo let qf sp d f 0 w spd f 0 spo denote the composition of the inclusion and the forgetful functor uf and we can define a functor pf sp o sp d f 0 w by sending an orthogonal spectrum y to the d f w 0 spectrum 5 1 pf y g v y v pf y 1 2 y 2 14 zhen huan for any object g v and any morphism 1 2 in d f 0 lemma 5 4 pf qf sp o qf pf sp d f 0 w is a pair of adjoint functors in addition the unit f idx qf pf is an isomorphism analogous to proposition 4 3 and theorem 4 5 we can construct the f level model structure and the f global model structure on sp d f 0 w theorem 5 5 there is a model structure on sp d f 0 w quillen equivalent to the f level model structure on orthogonal spectra in proposition 4 3 5 20 in addition there is a model structure on sp d f 0 w quillen equivalent to the f global model structure on orthogonal spectra in theorem 4 3 17 20 more generally for any global family f we have the question whether there is a model structure on the category sp d f 0 w quillen equivalent to the f global model structure on orthogonal spectra moreover as shown in section 6 4 14 there is a reedy model structure on sp d f 0 w when f is the global family of finite groups we can define a degree function on df 0 by deg g v g dimv the order of the group g times the dimension of the vector space v in proposition 6 16 14 we show that df 0 is a dualizable generalized reedy category in the sense of definition 1 1 4 with the linear isometric embeddings raising the degree and the restriction maps lowering the degree thus there is a reedy model structure on spd f 0 moreover on sp d f 0 w we describe roughly the reedy model structure on sp d f 0 w below definition 5 6 a map f x y in sp d f 0 w is a reedy cofibration if for each object r in df 0 the relative latching map xr lr x lr y yr is a aut r cofibration reedy weak equivalence if for each r f r h x r h y r h is a weak equivalence for each subgroup h of aut r reedy fibration if for each r the relative matching map xhr mr x h mr y h y h r is a serre fibration for each subgroup h of aut r theorem 5 7 the reedy cofibrations reedy weak equivalences and reedy fi brations form a model structure the reedy model structure on sp d f 0 w almost global homotopy theory 15 6 examples quasi theories quasi elliptic cohomology is a variant of tate k theory it is not an elliptic cohomology but does reflect the geometric features of the tate curve it has simpler form than most elliptic cohomology theories and can be expressed explicitly by equivariant k theories which can be globalized a thorough introduction of this theory can be found in 15 and chapter 2 14 in 13 we construct a ig fsp representing quasi elliptic cohomology up to a weak equivalence which however cannot arise from an orthogonal spec trum in 17 we apply the idea to construct a ig fsp weakly representing each quasi theory qe n g in this section we show these ig fsp together define a dw 0 spectrum 6 1 quasi theories in this section we recall the quasi theories the main reference for that is 16 let g be a compact lie group and n denote a positive integer let gtorsconj denote a set of representatives of g conjugacy classes in the set gtors of torsion elements in g let gnz denote set 1 2 n i g tors conj i j is the identity element in g let 1 2 n g n z define cg n i 1 cg i 6 1 g cg r n 1 e 1 2 e 2 n en 6 2 where cg i is the centralizer of each i in g and e 1 e 2 en is a basis of r n let q t u 1 denote the representation t 7 e 2 it let qi 1 q 1 tn u 1 denote the tensor product with q at the i th position and trivial representations at other position the representation ring r tn r t n z q 1 q n we have the exact sequence 6 3 1 cg g tn 0 where the first map is g 7 g 0 and the second map is g t 1 tn e 2 it 1 e 2 itn then the map r tn r g equips the representation ring r g the structure as an r tn module this is lemma 3 1 16 presenting the relation between rcg and r g lemma 6 1 r tn r g exhibits r g as a free r t n module there is an r tn basis of r g given by irreducible representations v such that restriction v 7 v cg to cg defines a bijection between v and the set of irreducible representations of cg definition 6 2 for equivariant cohomology theories e h h and anyg space x the corresponding quasi theory qe n g x is defined to be gnz e g x 16 zhen huan example 6 3 motivating example tate k theory and quasi elliptic cohomol ogy tate k theory is the generalized elliptic cohomology associated to the tate curve the elliptic cohomology theories form a sheaf of cohomology theories over the moduli stack of elliptic curves mell tate k theory over specz q is obtained when we restrict it to a punctured completed neighborhood of the cusp at i e the tate curve tate q over specz q section 2 6 1 the divisible group associated to tate k theory is gm q z other than the theory over specz q we can define variants of tate k theory over specz q and specz q respectively the theory over specz q is of especial interest inverting q allows us to define a sufficiently non naive equivariant cohomol ogy theory and to interpret some constructions more easily in terms of extensions of groups over the circle the resulting cohomology theory is called quasi elliptic cohomology 18 14 15 its relation with tate k theory is 6 4 qell g x z q z q k tate g x which also reflects the geometric nature of the tate curve the idea of quasi elliptic cohomology is motivated by ganter s construction of tate k theory 6 it is not an elliptic cohomology but a more robust and algebraically simpler treatment of tate k theory this new theory can be interpreted in a neat form by equivariant k theories some formulations in it can be generalized to equivariant cohomology theories other than tate k theory quasi elliptic cohomology qell g is exactly the quasi theory qk 1 g in definition 6 2 example 6 4 generalized tate k theory and generalized quasi elliptic coho mology in section 2 8 ganter gave an interpretation of g equivariant tate k theory for finite groups g by the loop space of a global quotient orbifold apply the loop construction n times we can get the n th generalized tate k theory the divisible group associated to it is gm q z n with quasi theories we can get a neat expression of it consider the quasi theory qk n g x gnz k g x qk n g x z q n z q n is isomorphic to the n th generalized tate k theory 6 2 construction of the dw 0 spectrum in this section we show the con struction of a dc spectrum representing the theory qe n g the details of the construction are in section 5 17 with the main conclusion theorem 5 18 another reference is chapter 4 14 let g be a compact lie group we consider equivariant cohomology theories e that have the same key features as equivariant complex k theories more explicitly the theories e g g have the change of group isomorphism i e for any closed subgroup h of g and h space x the change of group map gh e g g hx e h x defined by e g g h x e h g h x i e h x is an isomorphism where is the restriction map and i x g h x is the h equivariant map defined by i x e x there exists an orthogonal spectrum e such that for any compact lie group g and large real g representation v and a compact g space b we have a bijection eg b b e v g and eg e e is the underlying orthogonal almost global homotopy theory 17 g spectrum of e let g be a compact lie group and v an orthogonal g representation for every ample g representation w the adjoint structure map ev w e v map sw e v w is a g weak equivalence in theorem 5 18 17 we introduce the conclusion below theorem 6 5 for each positive integer n and each compact lie group g there is a well defined functor qg n from the category of orthogonal ring spectra to the category of ig fsp sending e to qen g qen qen that weakly represents the quasi theory qe n g we sketch the construction of the ig fsp qen g qen qen below for more details please see 17 let v be a real g representation let sym v n 0 symn v denote the total symmetric power it in herits a g action from that on v let s g v sym v sym v n i 1 sym v sym v i for each 1 n g n z let e denote the unitary global spectrum representing the theory e v r is a specific real g representation introduced in a 2 in ap pendix 17 we show the construction below let be a complex g representation with underlying space v let i cg g denote the inclusion let denote all the irreducible complex representations of cg we have the decomposition of cg representation i v into its isotypic components i v v where v denotes the sum of all subspaces of v isomorphic to each v homcg g v c is unique as a subspace each v can be equipped with a g action each i is of the form e 2 im i li i with li the order of i 0 m i li and i the identity matrix as shown in lemma 6 1 we have the well defined complex g representations v v c q m 1 l 1 q m n ln and 6 5 v v in addition 6 6 v r v r c v r c is real g representation it is faithful when v is a faithful realg representation from the ingredients above we construct 6 7 f g v mapr s v r e v r v we have the unit map g v s v f g v and the multiplication f g v h w f g v f h w f g h v w 18 zhen huan cited in proposition 5 2 i 17 6 8 qen g v t 1 a t 2 b f g v s g v b 6 t 2 t 1 c 0 t 2 b where denotes the join 6 9 qen g v gnz mapcg g qen g v we use x to denote the basepoint of qen g v for each v s v there are v 1 s v and v 2 s v such that v v 1 v 2 let qen g v s v qen g v be the map 6 10 qen g v v 1 v 2 g v v 1 v 2 v 2 if v 2 6 1 x if v 2 1 the unit map is defined by 6 11 qen g v sv gnz mapcg g qen g v v 7 gnz 7 qen g v v next we construct the multiplication map qen first we define a map qen g v h w qen g v qen h w qen g h v w by sending a point t 1 a 1 t 2 b 1 u 1 a 2 u 2 b 2 to 6 12 1 t 22 u 2 2 f g v h w a 1 a 2 if t 2 2 u 2 2 1 and t 2 u 2 6 0 t 22 u 2 2 b 1 b 2 1 t 2 f g v h w a 1 a 2 t 2 b 1 if u 2 0 and 0 t 2 1 1 u 2 f g v h w a 1 a 2 u 2 b 2 if t 2 0 and 0 u 2 1 1 f g v h w a 1 a 2 0 if u 2 0 and t 2 0 x otherwise where x is the basepoint of qen g h v w the basepoint of qen g v is the product of the basepoint of each factor mapcg g qen g v i e the product of the constant map to the basepoint of each qen g v we can define the multiplication qen g v h w qen g v qen h w qen g h v w by gn z hn z 7 g n z h n z 7 qen g v h w however the equivariant orthogonal spectra cannot arise from a global spec trum in the sense of remark 4 1 2 20 almost global homotopy theory 19 6 3 qen is a global spectrum in sp w d 0 via a completely parallel proof to that of theorem 7 1 5 14 we have the conclusion below theorem 6 6 the ig fsp qen ig gt together with the unit map qen defined in 6 11 and the multiplication qen g g that weakly rep resents the quasi theory qe n g with g varying all the finite groups can fit to gether to give a dw 0 spectrum first we show the unstable conclusion theorem 6 7 qen is a d w 0 space proof let g v and h w be two objects and 1 2 g v h w be a morphism in d 0 let h denote h o 2 v recall both 1 and 2 are injective note that for 1 n h n z 1 1 1 1 n can be in gnz 2 gives the linear isometric embedding 6 13 2 v r 1 v 1 w r w v 1 v 2 7 2 v 1 2 v 2 it is equivariant in the sense that 2 1 a t x a t 2 x for any x v r 1 v 1 a t h and 1 a t g 1 let s v r 1 e v r 1 v 1 be an element in f 1 g v we can define f mapr s v r 1 e v r 1 v 1 map r s w r e w r w with each f defined by the composition s w r s w r v r 1 s v r 1 id s w r v r 1 e v r 1 v 1 e w r v 1 e id 2 e w r w where the third map is the structure map of e and id 2 is the evident linear isometric embedding w r v 1 w r w it is r linear it s straightforward to check for morphisms g v 1 2 h w 1 2 k u so we have 6 14 f f 1 f for any k o 2 2 v and if is the identity map f is identity for each 2 gives embeddings sym v sym w and sym v 1 sym w so we have well defined 6 15 s s g v 1 s h w which is equivariant in the sense s 1 y s y for any ch 20 zhen huan then we have the join f s f 1 g v s g v 1 f h w s h w let qen 1 g v qen h w denote the quotient of the restriction of f s in addition for each hnz each f mapcg 1 g qen 1 g v we can define f ch ch h mapch g qen h w by 6 16 f f 1 for each ch ch h then we define qen mapcg 1 g qen 1 g v mapch h qen h w by 6 17 qen f g f g if g ch ch h c 0 otherwise where c 0 denotes the basepoint of qen h w finally we define 6 18 qen hn z qen qen g v qen h w for those gnz not conjugate to any element inh n z the factor mapcg g qen g v has no effect on the image if is the identity map qen is the identity map if g v h w and h w k u are two morphisms in d we have qen qen qen so qen defines a d w 0 space theorem 6 8 qen is a d 0 fsp weakly representing qe n especially qen is a global ring spectrum in spd 0 w the proof is analogous to the proof of theorem 7 2 3 14 it is straightforward and left to the readers remark 6 9 given a unitary global spectrum representing e we can also construct a unitary dw 0 spectrum representing qe n in the same way described in this section the complex g representations needed in the construction is constructed in section a 1 17 remark 6 10 in 19 stapleton discussed the generalized morava e theories 19 e n l h x g almost global homotopy theory 21 where l is the p adic loop functor l x g homtop gpd zp x g hom zp g x im g and h is a positive integer in the case when e g g are equivariant cohomology theories satisfying the conditions at the beginning of section 6 2 we can construct a ig fsp weakly representing each e lh x g the construction is analogous to that of qeh g and contains many details and symbols theorem 6 5 guarantees that these ig fsp together give a d w 0 spectrum representing e lh which means it can be globalized in the almost global homotopy theory if e 0 bz p is the ring of functions on the p torsion of the formal group ge of e then the p divisible group associated to e lh is ge qp zp h remark 6 11 in this paper we show that from one global ring spectrum e we can construct infinitely many almost global spectrum qen n n so there is a large family of examples for global homotopy theory moreover in light of remark 6 10 i have the question whether the conjecture is true that the globalness of a cohomology theory is completely determined the formal component of its divisible group and when the e tale component of it varies the globalness does not change
