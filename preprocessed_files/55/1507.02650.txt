spectral sequence converging to the homotopy groups of the semi cosimplicial e 8 ring spectrum qp 2 qp 3 q this 3 local spectrum was constructed by m behrens using degree 2 isogenies of elliptic curves and its localization with respect to the 2 nd morava k theory kp 2 q is one half of the kp 2 q local sphere at the prime 3 the computation in this paper uses techniques developed in the author s previous work 9 on the adams novikov spectral sequence for qp 2 qp 3 q and provides another gateway to the homotopy ring qp 2 qp 3 q 1 introduction in his work on the kp 2 q local sphere behrens 2 3 constructs a p local e 8 ring spectrum qpnqppq for each prime p and positive integer n not divisible by p for fixed p and n this spectrum is the homotopy limit of a semi cosimplicial diagram qpnq ppq of the form qpnq ppq tmfppq tmf 0 pnqppq tmfppq tmf 0 pnqppq 1 where tmfppq and tmf 0 pnqppq are the p localizations of topological modular forms and its analog for 0 pnq sl 2 pzq respectively the arrows in 1 denote alternating sums of two resp three coface maps each defined in terms of degree n isogenies of elliptic curves in the case p 3 andn 2 thekp 2 q localization of 1 is a reinterpretation of thekp 2 q local sphere resolution constructed by goerss henn mahowald and rezk 7 moreover behrens 2 theorem 2 0 1 has shown that dlkp 2 qqp 2 qp 3 q dlkp 2 q lkp 2 qs lkp 2 q lkp 2 qqp 2 qp 3 q 2 is a cofiber sequence where lkp 2 q is bousfield localization with respect to kp 2 q is the unit map of qp 2 qp 3 q and d is the kp 2 q local spanier whitehead duality functor therefore the kp 2 q local sphere decomposes in terms of lkp 2 qqp 2 qp 3 q anddlkp 2 qqp 2 qp 3 q and the homotopy groups of these three spectra are intertwined the analog of 2 for p 5 and n 2 is penn state

conjecture 1 6 1 the case p 2 is addressed by behrens and k ormsby in 5 in this paper we leverage the cosimplicial structure of qp 2 qp 3 q and compute the e 2 term of the bousfield kan spectral sequence bkss converging to qp 2 qp 3 q we shall denote the e 2 term of this spectral sequence by bke s t 2 qp 2 qp 3 q our computation gives explicit descriptions of the elements in this e 2 term up

1 in section 3 we set up the bkss for qp 2 qp 3 q along with several algebraic tools needed for pursuing the 2 e 2 term sections 4 and 5 are the most technical and contain the computations needed to finish the proof of theorem 1 1 finally in section 6 we briefly examine the structure of the differentials on the e 2 page and beyond in the bkss 2 statement of main results this section outlines our strategy for proving theorem 1 1 our approach resembles that from our previous work 9 on the adams novikov e 2 term for qp 2 qp 3 q in propositions 2 1 2 3 below there are references to two graded zp 3 q algebras b and these algebras piece together to form an elliptic curve hopf algebroid that will be defined in section 3 this hopf algebroid is the key algebraic object underlying our computation to begin we express the bousfield kan e 2 term for qp 2 qp 3 q algebraically proposition 2 1 the bkss e 2 term for qp 2 qp 3 q is the cohomology of a semi cosimplicial abelian group more precisely it has the form bke s t 2 qp 2 qp 3 q h sp ttmfp 3 q bt 2 ttmfp 3 q bt 2 q where the coface maps are induced by the corresponding maps in 1 for notational convenience we put g p tmfp 3 q b 2 tmfp 3 q b 2 q 3 so that bke s t 2 qp 2 qp 3 q h sg t by proposition 2 1 the following proposition describes a two stage filtration that we use to compute h g proposition 2 2 there is a filtration g f 0 f 1 f 2 of g inducing a short exact sequence 0 c 1 g c 2 0 where c 1 p 0 b 2 h b 2 q c 2 p tmfp 3 q g tmfp 3 q 0 q the resulting long exact sequence in cohomology is 0 h 0 g ker g 0 ker h h 1 g coker g 1 coker h h 2 g 0 so that h 0 g ker 0 h 2 g coker 1 and h 1 g lies in the short exact sequence 0 coker 0 h 1 g ker 1 0 4 moreover coker 0 is concentrated in t degree 0 and ker 1 is free of rank 1 in t degree 0 so that the sequence 4 splits in t degree 0 and h 1 g ker 1 in nonzero t degrees leveraging the filtration given in proposition 2 2 requires computing the kernels and cokernels of the maps g and h we do so by applying some technical results from our previous work 9 on the anss for qp 2 qp 3 q throughout this paper at will denote the torsion subgroup of an abelian group a 3 proposition 2 3 as zp 3

the bousfield kan spectral sequence for qp 2 qp 3 q and its underlying algebraic apparatus in particular we prove propositions 2 1 and 2 2 4 3 1 the homotopy of tmfp 3 qtmfp 3 qtmfp 3 q and tmf 0 p 2 qp 3 qtmf 0 p 2 qp 3 qtmf 0 p 2 qp 3 q we begin by formally defining qp 2 qp 3 q in terms of the semi cosimplicial diagram 1 with p 3 n 2 the coface maps will be defined later in this section in terms of algebraic data definition 1 the spectrum qp 2 qp 3 q is given by qp 2 qp 3 q holimptmfp 3 q tmf 0 p 2 qp 3 q tmfp 3 q tmf 0 p 2 qp 3 qq that is qp 2 qp 3 q holimqp 2 q p 3 q the homotopy rings tmfp 3 q and tmf 0 p 2 qp 3 q will play a key role in our computation and they both arise from the data in an elliptic curve hopf algebroid over zp 3 q that we shall denote pb q we will often suppress the grading and simply write pb q this hopf algebroid co represents the groupoid of non singular elliptic curves over zp 3 q with weierstrass equation y 2 4 xpx 2 q 2 x q 4 q 5 and isomorphisms x x r that

congruent to 0 modulo 4 the spectral sequence 6 has been computed by hopkins and miller expository accounts of this computation can be found in 1 8 and 10 we recall the results of this computation

with s along the vertical axis and 2 t s along the horizontal axis a black square denotes a copy of zp 3 q and a black circle denotes a copy of z p 3 q lines of slope 1 3 represent multiplication by and lines of slope 5 3 represent multiplicative extensions induced by the relation b 3 in 27 not shown in the chart are most of the elements on the line s 0 these elements will be enumerated below in subsection 3 4 the portion of the e 8 term shown is 72 periodic with invertible generator 3 remark 1 the groups ext pb bq are encoded as the cohomology groups of the cobar resolution for pb q a cochain complex of the form b b b b 11 a 1 2 11 where the differentials are defined in terms of the structure maps of pb q for example p 3 tmfp 3 q is represented by r p in the cobar resolution similarly b p 27 tmfp 3 q is represented by r p and p 10 tmfp 3 q is represented by r 2 br rbr 2 p b representatives for the other torsion elements in tmfp 3 q can be computed via the cobar resolution pairing defined in 11 a 1 2 15 6 3 2 coface maps and the bkss setup to define the coface maps appearing in definition 1 we will need four hopf algebroid maps d pb bq pb bq f pb q pb bq q pb q pb bq r 2 s pb q pb q definition 3 the maps d f q and r 2 s are induced by the following maps of zp 3 q algebras d b b q 2 2 q 2 q 4 q 2 2 4 q 4 f b q 2 q 2 q 4 q 4 r 0 q b q 2 2 q 2 q 4 q 2 2 4 q 4 r 0 r 2 s q 2 4 q 2 q 4 16 q 4 r 4 r remark 2 these maps are defined in terms of certain maneuvers with weierstrass equations of elliptic curves and are therefore most naturally defined in the context of algebraic stacks we shall not discuss these maneuvers here but the details can be found in 2 section 1 5 and are recapitulated in 9 section 3 3 we may now define the coface maps we do so on the level of hopf algebroids and the maps in definition 1 are the corresponding maps of spectra which by abuse of notation will be denoted using the same symbols definition 4 the map out of tmfp 3 q is induced by the alternating sum d 0 d 1 where d 0 q r 2 s d 1 f 1 pb q and the map into tmf 0 p 2 qp 3 q is induced by the alternating sum d 0 d 1 d 2 where d 0 d d 1 f d 2 1 pb bq to elucidate the structure of the bkss for qp 2 qp 3 q we start with an observation of behrens 4 about the e 1 term namely that bke s t 1 qp 2 qp 3 q tqp 2 q s p 3 q t sqp 2 qp 3 q in other words the e 1 term is the semi cosimplicial abelian group qp 2 q p 3 q g the e 2 term is therefore obtained by taking cohomology of g at each of its three nontrivial stages within the general framework of the bousfield kan technology the relevant notion is that of cohomotopy definition 5 the sth cohomotopy group sg of a a semi cosimplicial abelian group g is given by sg hsg where cohomology is taken with respect to the alternating sums of the coface maps of g therefore bke s t 2 qp 2 qp 3 q s tqp 2 q p 3 q h s tqp 2 q p 3 q and since ttmf 0 p 2 qp 3 q bt 2 by lemma 3 1 b this proves proposition 2 1 7 3 3 filtration of g g g we now define the filtration g f 0 f 1 f 2 asserted to exist in proposition 2 2 for ease of notation we will henceforth denote by 1 the maps 1 pb bq 1 pb q and any maps they induce or correspond to the meaning will be clear from the context the filtration we want is f 1 p tmfp 3 q r 2 s 1 tmfp 3 q 0 q and f 2 is the trivial complex the induced short exact sequence is given by c 1 0 b d 1 b g tmfp 3 q b tmfp 3 q b c 2 tmfp 3 q r 2 s 1 tmfp 3 q 0 which leads to the following definition of the maps g and h appearing in the statement of proposition 2 2 definition 6 g r 2 s 1 tmfp 3 q tmfp 3 q h d 1 b b with the exception of the splitting of the short exact sequence 4 proposition 2 2 follows from standard homological algebra see e g section 1 3 of 12 the connecting map 0 is the restriction of q f to ker g while the connecting map 1 is induced by f 3 4 algebraic properties of b b b and tmfp 3 q tmfp 3 q tmfp 3 q in this subsection we lay the algebraic groundwork for our computation by examining the rings b and tmfp 3 q the results and notation from this subsection parallel those in 9 subsection 3 2 we start with b where we define a new elements p b 4 as follows cf 9

respect to the map h this was proven in 9 subsection 4 3 the following definition gives a convenient enumeration of these elements particularly for our study of the connecting map 1 in subsection 5 2

some results on tmfp 3 q specifically we will focus on elements in ane 0 8 tmfp 3 q that is elements on the 0 line of the anss for tmfp 3 q lemma 3 4 if itmf tpn 1 2 3 q 0 n p z p t 0 1 u p 1 2 q p tp

repre sentatives for these basis elements in ext 0 pb bq so that we may compute the maps into out of tmfp 3 q or subquotients thereof in the bkss lemma 3 5 a ext 0 pb bq zp 3 qrc 4 c 6 1 s p 1728 c 3

represent in ane 0 8 tmfp 3 q tmfp 3 q in particular we may interpret lemma 3 5 as saying that btmf is a zp 3 q basis for ane 0 8 tmfp 3 q we now give notation for the submodules of tmfp 3 q spanned

fication by lemma 3 5 b and definition 10 the value of v in vc m v depends on whether 0 m v is divisible by 3 since 0 m tm 3 u this 3 divisiblity in turn depends on the value of m modulo 9 as well as the value of v an elementary calculation then shows that the above definition of the sequence t vu is correct an analogous argument justifies the above definition of the sequence t vu corollary 3 8 0

of the maps ggg and hhh in this section we initiate our computation of bke 2 qp 2 qp 3 q by computing the kernel and cokernel of the maps g tmfp 3 q tmfp 3 q and h b b from definition 6 these computations prove proposition 2 3 to begin we record a useful result in 3 adic analysis 10 lemma 4 1 9 lemma 8 a if 0 n p z then 3 p 4 n 1 q 3 pnq 1 next we compute the effect of g on an element of

is itself represented in the cobar resolution see remark 1 by x 1 p p bsqt since g r 2 s 1 the formulas from definition 3 imply that g x 1 p 2 t 1 qx 1 corollary 4 3 ker g 0 tmfp 3 q p tmfp 3 qqt and coker g tmfp 3 q coker g where coker g denotes the set of all relations of the form 3 3 ptq 1 x 0 for x represented by an element in ext 0 t pb bq with t 0 proof if t 0 then 2 t 1 0 by degree counting the elements in the anss for tmfp 3 q with t degree 0 are exactly those with topological degree 2 t s 0 thus 0 tmfp 3 q ker g by lemma 4 2 elements in p tmfp 3 qqt have t degree nonzero and even and they generate copies of z p 3 q since 2 t 1 4 t 2 1 is always divisible by 3 for t even lemma 4 2 implies p tmfp 3 qqt ker g the remaining elements in tmfp 3 q namely the nontrivial elements in ane 0 t 8 qp 2 qp 3 q for t 0 are non torsion and therefore are not in ker g the formula for ker g follows the formula for coker g follows immediately from lemmas 4 1 and 4 2 remark 4 the relation coker g has no effect on elements of p tmfp 3 qqt since they all generate copies of z p 3 q it also has no effect on elements of 0 tmfp 3 q since they are pre cisely the elements whose representatives in the anss lie in t degree 0 the affected ele ments are precisely the remaining ones namely those whose representatives lie on the 0 line ane 0 t 8 tmfp 3 q with t 0 the kernel and cokernel of h were

which proves b by lemma 3 6 it remains to study 1 w m for p mq p 0 0 q and we shall do so for the remainder of this subsection first however we establish some convenient notational conventions

proof equations 11 12 13 and 14 follow from the proof of 9 proposition 9 and the results cited therein mutatis mutandis lemma 3 3 proposition 3 7 and remark 3 imply the remaining statements guided by lemma 5 3 we shall now divide our remaining computations of 1 into cases depending on the values of and m in each case we will find matrix representations of 1 just as we did with 0 in eq 9 remark 5 in eq 14 when m 13 p 27 q the quantity 1 pdm 1 m q is a nontrivial linear combination of the generators bmv which is precisely the reason for the undetermined submodule u bke 1 2 qp 2 qp 3 q in

longer a column of zeros rather by 9 lemma 12 a it has at least one nonzero entry in and above the row containing uy this yields the following lemma lemma 5 8 suppose m 0 and m 13 p 27 q a the

2 2 and 5 1 yield the result for h 0 g proposition 5 1 also implies that coker 0 is concentrated in t degree zero while proposition 5 2 implies that ker 1 is a free zp 3 q module of rank 1 generated by 1 tmfp 3 q thus the short exact sequence 4 splits as claimed in proposition 2 2 which means the result for h 1 c follows from proposition 5 1 combined with lemmas 5 4 5 5 5 6 5 7 and 5 8 b finally the result for h 2 c follows from proposition 2 2 lemmas 5 4 5 7 and 5 8 a and definition 12 6 higher differentials in the bkss in this final section we briefly examine the anatomy of the
