theorem 122 7 2 another example 125 bibliography 129 introduction this work has its origin in a problem related with p local finite groups 10 these algebraic objects are triples s f l where s is a finite p group and f and l are categories which encode fusion information among the subgroups of s in fact they contain the data needed to build topological spaces which behave as p completions of classifying spaces of finite groups bg p while a finite group give rise to a p local finite group in a natural way there are p local finite groups which do not arise from finite groups these are called exotic p local finite groups and examples have already been found in 10 26 36 and 14 prof a viruel wondered a few years ago if these exotic p local finite group arise or not from an infinite group the work of aschbacher and chermak shows that this is the case for some of the solomon 2 local finite groups 26 an approach to find a candidate to this infinite group is to use the normalizer decomposition for a p local finite group s f l 27 it gives a description of the nerve l as a homotopy colimit in the sense of bousfiled and kan 8 of spaces which has the homotopy type of classifying spaces of finite groups hocolim sdc c l here sdc is a partially ordered set poset for short built from the p local finite group s f l and c sdc top is a functor which satisfies c b autl for every sdc where b grp top is a functor which sends a discrete small group to a classifying space for it if this homotopy colimit has the homotopy type of an eilenberg maclane space hocolim sdc c b then is a candidate for infinite group from which the original p local finite group arises thus the problem we have focused on is problem 1 given a diagram of groups g c grp and a cone g when is the natural map hocolim c bg b a homotopy equivalence and in case it is not can we compute the fiber of this map 5 6 introduction a classical result of j h c whitehead states that if c is the pushout category b a c and is the amalgamated product g b g a g c i e the direct limit lim g then hocolimc bg b thus in this case we have an affirmative answer to our problem it is worthwhile noticing that also in this particular case we have that the category c is contractible and that the arrows a b and c are monomorphisms g b t b nn nn nn nn nn n g a a xxxxxxxx f ff ff ff f g b g a g c g c c 77 ppppppppppp studying further the fiber in the general case we find that theorem 2 let g c grp be a functor and let g lim g be the limit cone to the direct limit lim g assume c is contractible and is a monomorphism on each object then if f is the fiber of the map hocolim c bg b lim g we have that f is simply connected and hj f lim j 1 h for each j 2 where h c ab is a functor thus when we assume the same hypothesis as in whitehead s theorem it turns out that the homology groups are given by the higher direct limits lim j h for a functor h c ab from c to abelian groups before continue put definition 3 let h c ab be a functor then we say that it is lim acyclic if lim j h 0 for j 1 then it is clear by g w whitehead s theorems 43 that f is homotopic to a point i e hocolimc bg b lim g if and only if h is lim acyclic thus we have reduced the homotopy theory problem 1 to the following problem of homological algebra problem 4 given a functor h c ab when does it hold that h is lim acyclic and in case it does not hold can we compute lim j h introduction 7 this is a very general problem and we shall assume one additional hypothesis to attack it it consist in restricting the category c mainly because the category sdc considered above is a graded partially ordered set a graded poset for short we assume that c is a graded poset these are special posets in which we can assign an integer to each object called the degree of the object in such a way that preceding elements are assigned integers which differs just in 1 thus a graded poset can be divided into a set of layers the objects of a fixed degree and these layers are linearly ordered this restriction is no so hard as simplicial complexes and subdivision categories are graded posets moreover each cw complex is strong homotopy equivalent to a graded poset coming back to problem 4 consider the functor h c ab as an object of the abelian category abc of functors from c to abelian groups because the higher limits lim j h are the left derived functors of the direct limit functor lim abc c then h projective is enough for h lim acyclic as left derived functors vanishes on projective objects this is a partial answer to problem 4 inasmuch that we know the projective objects of abc in order to study these projective objects we introduce definition 5 let h c ab be a functor over the graded poset c and let i 0 be an object of c then define coker i 0 h i 0 h i i 0 6 1 i 0 that is coker i 0 is the quotient of the value of h on i 0 by the images of the non trivial morphisms arriving to i 0 for example if i 0 is a minimal object of the graded poset c i e it has no non trivial arriving arrows then coker i 0 h i 0 the next theorem relates the projectiveness of h in abc with that of coker i 0 in ab theorem 6 let c be a graded poset and suppose h abc then h is projective in abc if and only if coker i 0 is projective in ab for each object i 0 of c h is pseudo projective this theorem characterizes the projective objects of abc although the second condition pseudo projectiveness is technical and thus i do not state it here for simplicity both conditions in the theorem are easy to check for a given functor h abc as we commented above h projective implies that h is lim acyclic but this last condition is clearly weaker than h being projective can we weak the condition of projectiveness and still have lim acyclicity then answer is yes and next theorem provide us the weaker condition theorem 7 let c be a graded poset and supposeh abc ifh is pseudo projective then h is lim acyclic thus pseudo projectiveness gives also an answer to problem 4 this last theorem is proven by constructing a spectral sequence for a given functor h abc over a graded poset c it is the grading of c which allows us to define certain filtered differential graded z module from which we build the spectral sequence 8 introduction proposition 8 let c be a graded poset and suppose h abc then there is a homological type spectral sequence e with target lim h to answer the second question in problem 4 we have made a dimension shift ing argument in the sense it is made in group cohomology 11 this is done by constructing a short exact sequence 0 k 1 h h 0 where the functor h is pseudo projective iterating this process we obtain lemma 9 let c be a graded poset and h c ab a functor then for each j 1 lim j h lim 1 kj 1 where h k 0 k 1 k 2 are functors in ab c we have also given an interpretation of the higher limit of order 1 lim 1 h as a flow problem in the directed graph associated to c all these tools can be applied to an ex ample told to us by a libman this example shows that the conditions c contractible and a monomorphism on each object are not enough to have hocolimc bg b lim g in general we compute the fiber of the map hocolimc bg b lim g by the methods above example 10 for any group consider the graded poset c and the functor g c grp with values a aa aa aa a 1 a aa aa aa a b bb bb bb b ii then there is a fibration 1 s 2 hocolim c bg b all the results concerning higher direct limits are contained in chapter 3 while the spectral sequence is introduced in chapter 2 results about the homotopy colimit as theorem 2 and example 10 are presented in chapter 7 this chapter also contains a proof of the theorem of j h c whitehead about the pushout and a proof of that the classifying space of a locally finite group is the homotopy colimit of the classifying spaces of its subgroups in order to wide our view of the developments till here we decided to dualize all the homological algebra results this is made in chapter 4 and the results are summarized below introduction 9 definition 11 let h c ab be a functor then we say that it is lim acyclic if lim j h 0 for j 1 definition 12 let h c ab be a functor over the graded poset c and let i 0 be an object of c then define ker i 0 i 0 i 6 1 i 0 h theorem 13 let c be a graded poset and suppose h abc then h is injective in abc if and only if ker i 0 is injective in ab for each object i 0 of c h is pseudo injective theorem 14 let c be a graded poset and suppose h abc ifh is pseudo injective then h is lim acyclic lemma 15 let c be a graded poset and h c ab a functor then for each j 1 lim j h lim 1 cj 1 where h c 0 c 1 c 2 are functors in ab c if we take h cz c ab in this lemma i e h equals the functor of con stant value z we obtain an approach to compute the integer cohomology groups h c z lim cz of the realization c of the graded poset c from now onwards we assume that h cz and we explain how a sharpener version of lemma 15 is obtained for h cz this is made in detail in chapter 5 first step is imposing some extra structure in the graded poset c in fact this extra structure is not very restrictive as each cw complex is still homotopy equivalent to a graded poset which carries this extra information we denote this structure by j and we call it a covering family for c it consist of a collection of subsets of objects of the category c we explain this briefly this collection of subsets j is of local nature in the sense that for each object i 0 of c we have several subsets of objects of c more precisely for a fixed i 0 we must choose subsets of objects of the subcategory i 0 c this under category corresponds to the full subcategory of c with objects i i 0 i i e it is exactly composed by the objects greater or equal to i 0 what we need on each category i 0 c amounts to a subset j i 0 p of objects from i 0 c for each appropriate degree p recall that objects of c are graded an example shall make this clearer 10 introduction example 16 suppose i 0 c has the following shape b 1 e 0 i 0 a 2 wwwwwwwww g gg gg gg gg c 1 f 0 d 1 g 0 where subindexes point out the degree of each object we can define j i 02 a j i 01 c d and j i 0 0 g the collection of subsets j must fulfill a covering condition and a inheritance condition the covering condition states that each object of i 0 c of a given degree p 1 must be preceded by an object of j i 0 p the inheritance condition states that if i j i 0 p 1 then j i p j i 0 p we come back to the earlier example to show what this means example 17 the covering condition for the object e of degree 0 if fulfilled as it is preceded by the object c j i 01 b e i 0 a yyyyyyyyy e ee ee ee ee c d f d g elements in j are boldfaced it is also fulfilled for f and for g as d j i 01 precedes f and c and d precede g if we define jd 1 d and j d 0 g f d g then the object d j i 01 fulfills the inheritance condition because j i 0 g j i 0 0 g the existence of this family j of subsets for each object i 0 of c plus a numerical condition adequateness involving the number of elements in the subsets of j gives proposition 18 let c be a graded poset category and let j be an adequate covering family for c then for each j 1 lim j cz lim 1 fj 1 where cz f 0 f 1 f 2 are functors in ab c which take free abelian groups as values introduction 11 the sequence of functors f 0 f 1 f 2 of proposition 18 have some advantages over the sequence of functors c 0 c 1 c 2 of lemma 15 applied to the functor h cz fj i 0 is a free abelian group for each object i 0 of c fj i 0 has far less generators than cj i 0 for each object i 0 of c and lim fj lim fj cj 1 j where cj 1 j is the full subcategory of c with objects of degrees j 1 and j the third statement above is the main feature of fj it is a generalization of the fact that the connected components of a simplicial complex are computed by just looking to the vertices and to the edges i e to the objects of degrees 0 and 1 the nice properties of fj causes our main theorem about integer cohomology theorem 19 let c be a bounded graded poset for which there exist an adequate covering family j and an adequate global covering family k then c is acyclic if and only if k 0 equals the number of connected components of c moreover in this case h 0 c z z k 0 here we are using the concept of adequate global covering family which plays the role of covering family for the whole category c instead of for each subcategory i 0 c the family k is composed of subsets kp one for each appropriate degree p this theorem reduces the lim acyclicity of the functor cz ab c i e the acyclicity of the space c to the integral equation k 0 0 c 0 c although the hypotheses in theorem 19 look very hard the existence of the family j is automatic for cop of course cop and c have the same homotopy type when c is a simplicial complex or a subdivision category in fact it applies to cop whenever the graded poset c is locally as a simplicial complex i e such that c i 0 is isomorphic to the poset of all non empty sets of a finite set with inclusion as order relation we call these posets simplex like posets thus the difficult point resides in finding a global family k in chapter 6 we describe a particular case where this global family k exists yielding a proof of part of a conjecture of webb the conjecture is related with the brown s complex 11 denoted sp g of a finite group g and a prime p webb conjectured that the orbit space sp g g is contractible this orbit space has as objects the g conjugation classes of chains of subgroups of sp g the conjecture was first proven by symonds in 40 generalized for blocks by barker 4 5 and extended to arbitrary saturated fusion system by linckelmann 28 the works of symonds and linckelmann prove the contractibility of the orbit space by showing that it is simply connected and acyclic and invoking g w whitehead s theorem both proofs of acyclicity work on the subposet of normal chains introduced by kno rr and robinson 25 for groups symonds uses the results from thevenaz and webb 41 that the subposet of normal chains is g equivalent to brown s complex linckelmann proves on his own that also for fusion systems the orbit space and the orbit space on the normal chains has the same cohomology 28 theorem 4 7 we apply theorem 19 to prove that the orbit space on the normal chains is acyclic the definition of the global covering family k is related with the pairing defined by 12 introduction linckelmann in 28 definition 4 7 we describe k briefly let s f be a saturated fusion system where s is a p group and consider its subdivision category s f and the poset s f an object of degree n in the orbit space of the normal chains s f is an f isomorphism class of chains q 0 q 1 qn where the qi are subgroups of s normal in qn the subcategory s f q 0 qn has objects qi 0 qim with 0 m n and 0 i 1 i 2 im n see 28 2 for example s f q 0 q 1 q 2 is q 0 j jj jj jj jj j q 0 q 1 qq qqq qqq qqq q q 1 99 tttttttttt j jj jj jj jj j q 0 q 2 q 0 q 1 q 2 q 2 99 tttttttttt q 1 q 2 66 mmmmmmmmmmmm then it is clear that s f is a simplex like poset and thus theorem 19 applies to s f op the definition of the global family k follows kn q 0 qn q 0 qn q 0 q n n i 0 ns q i q n it is easy to see that s f op has just one connected component thus by theorem 19 we can conclude that s f op is acyclic if it is the case that k 0 1 by definition k 0 q 0 q 0 q 0 ns q 0 q 0 because the unique subgroup of the p group s whose normalizer equals s is s itself we have that k 0 1 this finishes the exposition of the main results of the present work by chapter the contents are the following chapter 1 notation and preliminaries the notation used throughout the work is introduced as well as the definitions of derived functors and the nor malization theorems for simplicial abelian groups likewise graded posets are defined which are the categories over which the main results of the work are developed this kind of category have been chosen because it is the pro totype of the category sdc used in the normalizer decomposition mentioned above 27 moreover they include simplicial complexes section 1 4 and subdivision categories 28 and they contain all the homotopic information of cw complexes section 1 5 chapter 2 a spectral sequence a spectral sequence is built from differential graded modules associated to a functor h c ab where c is a graded poset the target of this spectral sequence is the higher limits lim h in a similar way another spectral sequence is built whose target is the higher inverse limits lim h introduction 13 chapter 3 higher direct limits projective objects in the abelian category abc are characterized where c is a graded poset moreover due to the spectral sequence from chapter 2 another family of objects of abc with vanishing higher direct limits is found they are the pseudo projective func tors finally a way of reducing the higher limit limj h of order j to limits of lower order is given and some applications of these results are worked out chapter 4 higher inverse limits this chapter is the dualization of chapter 3 in which the injective objects of abc are described and another family of functors with vanishing higher inverse limits is found the pseudo injective functors as application some tools for the computation of integer cohomol ogy of categories are developed in chapter 5 chapter 5 cohomology through some additional structure called covering families on the graded poset c it is proven that such a category is acyclic if and only if some integral equation involving geometrical elements of c is satisfied chapter 6 application webb s conjecture results from the earlier chapter are used to prove the cohomological part of webb s conjecture which has been proven in its maximal generality in 28 this conjecture states that the orbit space of the p subgroups poset of a finite group g is contractible chapter 7 application homotopy colimit although the study of homo topy colimits is the origin of this work it appears here as an application of earlier chapters it is proven whitehead s theorem which states that the pushout of eilenberg maclane spaces with injective morphisms is an eilenberg maclane space and an example is given of explicit computation of the fiber f also it is proven the well known fact that the classifying space of a locally finite group is the homotopy colimit of the classifying spaces of its finite subgroups finally we comment other applications where we hope the theory can contribute with some results first of them is to translate to the initial diagram of groups g c grp the conditions of pseudo projectiveness over h the functor h comes from theorem 2 in this way it should be obtained a generalized whitehead s theorem for diagrams larger than the pushout moreover it would be interesting to study its relation with mather s cube theorem the second application is take up again the original problem about p local finite groups we have already found conditions which imply that the functor c sdc top factorizes as sdc e ee ee ee ee c top grp b xxxxxxxx this makes possible to apply the theory to a honest diagram of groups moreover these conditions imply that sdc is contractible fulfilling one of the hypotheses of 14 introduction theorem 2 thus the next step is determine when is l an eilenberg maclane space or compute the fiber f f l b for appropriate group in favorable cases for example it can be shown that all the p rank 2 p local finite groups for p odd which are described in 14 have an eilenberg maclane space as non completed classifying space l the third possible application is related to quillen s conjecture 34 which states that the poset of the non trivial p subgroups of a finite group g sp g brown s complex 11 is contractible if and only if p g 6 1 where p g is the largest normal p subgroup of g a stronger formulation of this conjecture is that the integer reduced cohomology of this poset is trivial if and only if p g 6 1 this formulation is used in 3 due to theorem 19 this stronger formulation is equivalent to find an adequate covering family k g of sp g for each finite group g which satisfies the condition k g 0 1 p g 6 1 by results of bouc 7 and of the venaz and webb 41 we can also work with the poset of non trivial p radical subgroups or with the poset of non trivial elementary abelian p subgroups final note for reference it follows a list of the main points of the introduction and their corresponding statements in the manuscript for simplicity some statements over the boundedness of the graded poset c were omitted in the introduction these conditions are automatically satisfied in the applications and for finite graded posets we

que se preceden se diferencian en una unidad tras varios ejemplos y algunos hechos ba sicos se prueba que la funcio n de grado se puede extender a los morfismos del poset graduado y se definen los subconjuntos obs c y homs c como los objetos y flechas respectivamente cuyo grado pertenece a un subconjunto fijado s z acotacio n en posets graduados en esta subseccio n se definen los posets

introduce el grafo dirigido asociado a un poset graduado p como aque l que tiene los mismos objetos y tiene por aristas las flechas de grado 1 de p es decir las flechas que corresponden a dos elementos que se preceden capi tulo 1 notacio n y preliminares 21 en p a partir de aqu se introducen los conceptos de a rbol y a rbol maximal para posets graduados 1 4 complejos simpliciales despue s de definir los objetos geome tricos que constituyen los complejos simpliciales se los caracteriza como aquellos posets que localmente son simplex like y tales que cada par de elementos que tienen una cota inferior poseen un nfimo 18 adema s se muestra que todo conjunto simplicial puede ser visto como un poset graduado 1 5 realizacio n y tipo de homotop a en este punto se ha visto que tenemos las inclusiones conjuntos simpliciales posets graduados categor as usando que todo espacio topolo gico tiene el tipo de homotop a de bil de un cw complejo 43 los cuales a su vez tienen el tipo de homotop a de un complejo simplicial 23 y usando tambie n la subdivisio n barice ntrica 38 se llega a proposicio n para cualquier espacio x top existe un poset graduado p y una equivalencia de homotop a de bil x np esto significa que la restriccio n a posets graduados no implica pe rdida alguna desde el punto de vista homoto pico 1 6 functores derivados del l mite directo e inverso en esta seccio n se dan definiciones para los funtores derivados izquierdos lim i del funtor l mite directo lim abc c y para los funtores derivados derechos lim i del l mite inverso lim abc c donde c es una categor a pequen a sabemos 30 ix proposition 3 1 que abc es una categor a abeliana y que lim y lim son exactos por la derecha y por la izquierda respectivamente porque son los adjuntos por la izquierda y por la derecha del funtor ab abc definido por a 7 ca donde ca c ab es el funtor de valor constante a en vez de definir los funtores derivados a trave s de resoluciones proyectivas e inyectivas se definen como la homolog a cohomolog a de ciertos complejos de cadena cocadena basa ndose en 17 appendix ii 3 8 xii 5 5 y 8 xi 6 2 1 7 teorema de normalizacio n en esta seccio n se enuncian los teoremas de normalizacio n para grupos abelianos simpliciales y cosimpliciales los cuales se pueden encontrar en 31 22 1 22 3 y 19 viii 1 respectivamente estos teoremas establecen que la homolog a cohomolog a de un grupo abeliano simplicial cosimplicial se puede calcular omitiendo los s mplices cos mplices degenerados 22 resumen en castellano cap tulo 2 una sucesio n espectral en este cap tulo se introducen un par de sucesiones espectrales que tienen por l mites lim i f y lim i f donde f c ab es un funtor y c es un poset graduado y se dan condiciones de convergencia de bil la construccio n se hace a partir de mo dulos diferenciales graduados 32 estas sucesiones espectrales son el pilar fundamental en los desarrollos posteriores que se realizan en este trabajo las pa ginas iniciales se calculan como homolog a cohomolog a de subgrupos abelianos simpliciales cosimpliciales cuyos s mplices cos mplices son cadenas que empiezan y acaban con objetos de c en los cuales la funcio n de grado toma valores fijos 2 1 ejemplos en esta seccio n se describen numerosos ejemplos para ilustrar la construccio n de las sucesiones espectrales en casos concretos en particular se trabaja sobre las siguientes categor as pushout a b f oo g c pullback c g a f b telescopio a 0 f 1 a 1 f 2 a 2 f 3 a 3 f 4 a 4 y ciclo a g f c b h i d algunos de los comportamientos particulares de las sucesiones espectrales que se observan en estos ejemplos se generalizan en cap tulos posteriores a teoremas de a mbito general cap tulo 3 l mites directos superiores en este cap tulo se encuentran condiciones suficientes para que los l mites deriva dos superiores de un funtor dado f c ab se anulen es decir para que lim i f 0 si i 1 a estos funtores se les llamara funtores lim ac clicos as mismo se desarrollan ciertas herramientas para el ca lculo de estos l mites superiores en el caso general y se encuentran aplicaciones basa ndose en una analog a con el concepto de flujo en un grafo el desarrollo es como sigue en la seccio n 3 1 se caracterizan los objetos proyec tivos de la categor a abeliana abp donde p es un poset graduado recordemos que los funtores proyectivos son lim ac clicos a partir de esta caracterizacio n se deduce una condicio n ma s de bil pseudo proyectividad la cual tambie n implica lim aciclicidad este hecho se prueba en la seccio n 3 2 mediante el uso de las sucesiones espectrales del cap tulo 2 capi tulo 3 li mites directos superiores 23 en la seccio n 3 3 se construye un funtor pseudo proyectivo asociado a un funtor arbitrario f p ab mediante su uso y un argumento cla sico de cambio de dimensiones se demuestra como reducir el ca lculo de un l mite superior lim i f al ca lculo de un l mite superior de orden 1 lim 1 g donde g es un funtor que se construye a partir de f por u ltimo en la seccio n 3 4 se aplican los resultados de la seccio n anterior al caso en el que cierta subcategor a denotada core p de la categor a p es un a rbol todo el cap tulo esta ilustrado con ejemplos en los se concretan las ideas teo ricas desarrolladas 3 1 objetos proyectivos de abp dado un funtor f p ab donde p es un poset graduado podemos considerar para cada objeto i ob p el cociente de f i por las ima genes f donde hom p es un morfismo no trivial que termina en i a este cociente lo denotamos coker i pues bien en esta seccio n se demuestra que si f es proyectivo en abp entonces coker i es proyectivo en ab para todo i ob p f verifica una condicio n te cnica adicional que llamamos pseudo proyectividad y la cual en casos extremos se reduce a la inyectividad de los morfismos f hom p posteriormente se demuestra que si el poset graduado p es acotado inferiormente entonces estas dos condiciones mencionadas arriba implican la proyectividad de f con lo cual se obtiene una caracterizacio n completa de los proyectivos de abp 3 2 pseudo proyectividad recue rdese que la proyectividad de un objeto implica que los funtores derivados izquierdos se anulan sobre e l en particular los objetos proyectivos de abp son lim ac clicos teniendo en cuenta que la pseudo proyectividad es ma s de bil que la proyectividad en abp ver seccio n 3 1 es natural preguntarse si esa condicio n implica por s sola lim aciclicidad esta seccio n se dedica exclusivamente a probar este hecho que la pseudo proyectividad implica lim aciclicidad para ello se hace un uso intensivo de las sucesiones espectrales del cap tulo 2 se asume la hipo tesis adicional de que p es acotado inferiormente lo cual permite hallar una pa gina de la sucesio n espectral er para r suficientemente grande en la cual probar que las contribuciones al l mite son cero 3 3 calculando l mites superiores en esta seccio n se asocia a cada funtor f p ab un funtor pseudo proyectivo f y una transformacio n natural f f este funtor tiene varias propiedades interesantes entre las que destaca ser pseudo proyectivo y por tanto gracias a la seccio n 3 2 lim ac clico la sucesio n exacta corta 0 kf f f 0 nos da lim i f lim i 1 kf para i 1 la iteracio n de este argumento reduce el ca lculo de todos los l mites superiores de f al ca lculo de l mites de orden 1 sobre sucesivos 24 resumen en castellano funtores como aplicacio n se obtiene que un funtor con morfismos inyectivos sobre un a rbol es lim ac clico 3 4 lim 1 como un problema de flujo los problemas de flujo son un to pico en la teor a de grafos 6 un flujo no es ma s que la asignacio n de valores a las aristas de un grafo de forma que en cada ve rtice el flujo entrante iguala al saliente mientras que cla sicamente estos valores son nu meros naturales un sencillo argumento permite describir los 1 ciclos del complejo de cadena cuya homolog a en grado 1 es lim 1 f como flujos cuyo valor en la arista i 0 i 1 es un elemento de f i 0 esto da inmediatamente que lim 1 f 0 es decir todo 1 ciclo es 1 borde si y so lo si cada flujo se escribe como suma de ciertos flujos triviales minimales posteriormente la relativa rigidez de la estructura de un poset graduado permite re escribir cada flujo como un flujo sobre cierta subcategor a de p denotada core p finalmente se obtiene que la aciclicidad de core p es decir que esta subcate gor a sea un a rbol junto con la inyectividad de f implican la lim aciclicidad de este u ltimo cap tulo 4 l mites inversos superiores este cap tulo es la dualizacio n del cap tulo 3 y su desarrollo es como sigue 4 1 se caracterizan los objetos inyectivos de abp 4 2 se prueba mediante el uso de las sucesiones espectrales del cap tulo 2 que la pseudo inyectividad implica lim aciclicidad 4 3 mediante sucesiones exactas cortas se reducen el ca lculo de lim i f a l mites lim 1 g donde g es un funtor que se construye a partir de f como aplicacio n se han desarrollado herramientas para el ca lculo de cohomolog a de categor as y debido a su extensio n esto constituye el cap tulo 5 cap tulo 5 cohomolog a en esta seccio n y como aplicacio n de la teor a desarrollada en el cap tulo anterior de desarrollan herramientas para el ca lculo de la cohomolog a h p z de un poset graduado p bajo ciertas hipo tesis estructurales adicionales sobre p los conceptos introducidos a lo largo de las distintas secciones son de naturaleza local en el sentido de que dependen de las subcategor as i p y la restricciones f i p donde i es un objeto arbitrario de p inicialmente se asume que f es un funtor que toma por valores grupos abelianos libres para especializarse posteriormente al caso en que f cz y de este modo calcular la cohomolog a de p la u ltima seccio n describe una familia de posets graduados los simplex like posets a la cual pertenecen los complejos simpliciales y cuyos miembros verifican las hipo tesis estructurales adicionales la idea que gu a todo el cap tulo es la siguiente en el cap tulo anterior se construyo una sucesio n exacta corta 0 f f cf 0 capi tulo 5 cohomologi a 25 donde f es un funtor lim ac clico con objeto de reducir el ca lculo de los lim tes inversos superiores de f a lim tes de orden inferior sobre otro funtor los funtores f y cf puede ser muy grandes en el sentido de cantidad de generadores y con objeto de disminuir este taman o se considera otro funtor kerf ma s pequen o y se buscan condiciones bajo las cuales podamos construir sucesiones exacta cortas del tipo 0 f ker f g 0 iterativamente 5 1 functores p condensados en esta seccio n se considera el funtor kerf asociado al funtor f p ab y cuyo valor en i ob p es la interseccio n de los morfismos no triviales que salen de i fijado el entero p diremos que f es p condensado si f i 0 si deg i p y kerf i 0 si deg i p como veremos esta condicio n significa que la informacio n del funtor f esta con tenida de alguna manera en sus objetos de grado p te cnicamente nos permite construir la sucesio n exacta corta deseada 0 f ker f g 0 la seccio n termina dando una caracterizacio n de cua ndo el funtor g de la sucesio n exacta corta de arriba es p 1 condensado esto es importante ya que el objetivo final del cap tulo es hacer esta construccio n iterativamente adema s esta caracteri zacio n se usa en la siguiente seccio n para reducir el problema de cua ndo es g p 1 condensado a un conjunto de ecuaciones enteras con coeficientes que dependen de la estructura local de p 5 2 familias recubridoras dado un poset graduado p una familia recubri dora j del mismo es una familia de subconjuntos j ip i p p donde i recorre los objetos de p y p recorre los grados p deg i sometida a ciertas restricciones combinatorias como se ve la existencia o no de una familia recubridora so lo depende de la estructura local de p esto permite ver seccio n 5 4 construir familias recubri doras para posets que tiene una estructura local homoge nea y adecuada como son los simplex like posets un funtor f p ab que toma por valores grupos abelianos libres se dira que es j determinado donde j es una familia recubridora para p si la informacio n de f esta contenida en los objetos de los subconjuntos de j as se llega a la proposicio n 5 2 3 sea p un poset graduado y j una familia recubridora para p si el funtor f es p condensado y j determinado entonces el funtor g de la sucesio n exacta corta 0 f ker f g 0 es p 1 condensado y j determinado si se verifican un conjunto de ecuaciones enteras 26 resumen en castellano este teorema se puede aplicar iterativamente sin ma s que comprobar si ciertas ecuaciones enteras se verifican familias recubridoras adecuadas esta subseccio n se centra en el caso f cz con objeto de calcular la cohomolog a h p z si j es una familia recubridora para el poset graduado p diremos que es adecuada si podemos aplicar el teorema 5 2 3 iterativamente es decir si las ecuaciones enteras involucradas se verifican la condicio n de adecuacio n de j se define de nuevo mediante ciertas ecuaciones enteras que dependen de la estructura local de p en el caso de que j sea adecuada se obtiene una sucesio n de funtores f 0 cz f 1 f 2 cada uno de los cuales encaja en una sucesio n exacta corta 0 fp ker fp fp 1 0 bases y morfismos locales en esta subseccio n se dan descripciones expl citas de bases para los grupos abelianos libres que toman como valores los funtores f 0 f 1 f 2 construidos en la subseccio n anterior as mismo se dan descripciones expl citas de los morfismos fp donde hom p una vez ma s estas descripciones dependen de la estructura local de p y de la familia j considerada 5 3 comportamiento global centra ndose au n en el caso f cz y con siderando la sucesio n de funtores f 0 f 1 f 2 descrita en la subseccio n 5 2 1 se describen en esta seccio n propiedades de los l mites superiores de f que no dependen de la familia recubridora j elegida para construir la mencionada sucesio n de funtores en la subseccio n 5 2 2 se describieron propiedades que s dependen de j en particular se prueba un hecho ana logo a que la cohomolog a en grado n de un cw complejo so lo depende del n 1 esqueleto y una fo rmula para la caracter stica de euler que se reduce a la conocida suma alternada del nu mero de objetos de cada grado en caso de que p sea un simplex like poset ver seccio n 5 4 familias recubridoras globales en esta subseccio n se encuentra el teorema princi pal de este cap tulo se comienza definiendo el concepto de familia recubridora global k que a diferencia de su versio n local es decir de familia recubridora es una familia de subconjuntos kp obp p donde p recorre los grados posibles del poset graduado p obtenemos entonces el teorema 5 3 6 sea p un poset graduado para el que existe una familia re cubridora adecuada j y una familia recubridora global adecuada k entonces p es ac clico es decir h i p z 0 para i 0 si y so lo si k 0 iguala el nu mero de componentes conexas de p como se ve se ha reducido un problema de a lgebra homolo gica la aciclicidad de p a una ecuacio n entera que involucra elementos geome tricos de p 5 4 simplex like posets un simplex like poset no es ma s que un poset gra duado p

sistemas de fusio n saturados arbitrarios por linckelmann 28 los trabajos de symonds y linckelmann prueban la contractibilidad del espacio de o rbitas mostrando que es simplemente conexo y ac clico e invocando el teorema de whitehead ambas pruebas de aciclicidad trabajan con el subposet de las cadenas normales symonds usa los resultados de the venaz y webb 41 sobre que el subposet de las cadenas

notation and preliminaries 1 1 categories throughout this work we use the following familiar categories set the category of sets grp the category of groups ab the category of abelian groups top the category of topological spaces with arrows continuous maps sset the category of simplicial sets cat the category with objects the small categories and with arrows the functors between them and the pointed versions sset and top any other category is assumed to be a small category without explicit mention the objects of a category c are denoted by ob c and the arrows by hom c if c c ob c then homc c c denotes the arrows in c from c to c any functor f c d is covariant if not stated otherwise if s s ob set and k s then the constant function from s to s of value k is denoted by ck now we recall some concepts in category theory see 29 definition 1 1 1 a category c is connected if for any two objects c c ob c exists a chain of morphisms in c between c and c c c 1 c 2 cn 1 cn c definition 1 1 2 let s d c be a functor and c 0 ob c the category of objects s under c 0 c 0 s has objects all the pairs f d where d ob d and f homc c 0 s d and arrows h f d f d those arrows h d d in d for which s h f f definition 1 1 3 let s d c be a category and c 0 ob c the category of objects s over c 0 s c 0 has objects all the pairs f d where d ob d and f homc s d c 0 and arrows h f d f d those arrows h d d such that f s h f in particular for the identity functor 1 c c c we have the categories of objects under and over c 0 ob c respectively c 0 c def c 0 1 c and c c 0 def 1 c c 0 29 30 1 notation and preliminaries 1 2 groups and abelian groups for the product of two elements g g g grp the multiplicative notation gg is used while for a a a ab the additive notation a a is used another notations for the category ab are i i ai is the subgroup of a ab generated by the subgroups ai a i i ai denotes the direct sum coproduct of the abelian groups ai i i and i i ai denotes its direct product z infinite cyclic group zn order n cyclic group q rational numbers as additive group z p p prime the subgroup of q z generated by the cosets 1 pn z for n 0 recall that q z p prime z p z n z denotes the homomorphism m 7 nm and z redn z n is the canonical projection where n 0 if f a b and g c d are homomorphisms then f g a c b d is given by a c 7 f a g c and in case a c f g a b d b d is given by a 7 f a g a f a g a finally in case b d f g a c b is defined by a c 7 f g a c f a g c consider a functor f c grp with the category of groups as target category the functor f is called monic if f f is a monomorphism for each f hom c a natural transformation f f between functors f f c grp is called monic if i is a monomorphism for each i ob c similarly we call a functor f c grp epic if f f is an epimorphism for each f hom c a natural transformation f f between functors f f c grp is called epic if i is an epimorphism for each i ob p notice that by the natural inclusion ab grp we have defined the terms monic and epic also for functors c ab and natural transformations between them we collect a few basic facts about the category ab of abelian groups 1 the projective objects of ab are the free abelian groups 22 iii theorem 18 2 the injective objects of ab are direct sums of q and z p for various primes p 22 iii theorem 21 3 subgroups of free groups are free 22 ii theorem 15 4 finitely generated torsion free groups are free 22 ii theorem 16 we are also interested in maps a f b between free abelian groups which have free cokernel definition 1 2 1 let a f b be a map between free abelian groups we say that f is pure if coker f is a free abelian group 1 3 graded posets 31 if a zn is a finitely generated free abelian group we call rk a def n we have the following property of pure maps which will be used repeatedly in successive sections lemma 1 2 2 let a f b be a map in ab between free abelian groups of the same rank if f is pure and injective then it is an isomorphism proof the short exact sequence of free abelian groups 0 a f b coker f 0 implies that rka rkb rk coker f 0 and thus rk coker f 0 and coker f 0 definition 1 2 3 let f c ab be a functor we say that f is free if f i is a free abelian group for each i ob c notice that this does not imply that f is a free object in abc for example consider the category c and the functor f abc with values z 0 z the functor f is free definition 1 2 3 however it is not projective by corollary 3 1 12 and thus f is not a free object in abc 1 3 graded posets in this section we define a special kind of categories graded posets which are the main ingredient in most of the results of this work we begin defining posets definition 1 3 1 a poset is a category p in which given objects p and p there is at most one arrow p p and if there are arrows p p and p p then p p in any poset p define a binary relation on its objects ob p with p p if and only if there is an arrow p p then is reflexive symmetric and transitive i e ob p is a partial order conversely any partial order determines a poset in which the arrows are exactly those ordered pairs p p for which p p it is worthwhile noticing that if p is a poset and p 0 p then the categories p 0 p and p p 0 defined in section 1 1 are exactly the full subcategories of p with objects p p 0 p and p p p 0 respectively we define also the categories p 0 p and p p 0 as the full subcategories of p with objects p p 0 p p 6 p 0 and p p p 0 p 6 p 0 respectively 32 1 notation and preliminaries definition 1 3 2 if p is a poset and p p then p precedes p if p p p implies that p p or p p most of the results of this work are about the following types of posets definition 1 3 3 let p be a poset p is called graded if there is a function deg ob p z called the degree function of p which is order preserving and that satisfies that if p precedes p then deg p deg p 1 if p ob p then deg p is called the degree of p notice that the degree function associated to a graded poset is not unique consider the translations deg deg ck for k z according to the definition the degree function increases in the direction of the arrows we say that this degree function is increasing if the degree function is order reversing and satisfies the alternative condition that p precedes p implies deg p deg p 1 i e deg decreases in the direction of the arrows then we say that deg is a decreasing degree function clearly both definitions are equivalent by taking deg deg a poset which is graded satisfies some structural conditions lemma 1 3 4 if p is a graded poset and p p then there is an integer n and a finite chain p p 0 p 1 p 2 pn 1 pn p where pi precedes pi 1 for i 0 n 1 moreover if p q 0 q 1 q 2 qm 1 qm p is another finite chain where qi precedes qi 1 for i 0 m 1 then m n the proof of this lemma is straightforward example 1 3 5 the pushout category b a c the telescope category a b c and the opposite telescope category c b a are graded posets the integers z is a graded poset the rationals q with the usual order is a poset but it is not a graded poset by the first condition of lemma 1 3 4 as in the next example when drawing a poset we picture just the arrows p p where p precedes p example 1 3 6 the poset p 1 p 2 p oo ooo oo ooo oo ooo p q 1 is not graded by the second condition of lemma 1 3 4 1 4 simplicial complexes 33 if p is a graded poset we can extend the degree function deg to the morphisms set hom p by deg p p deg p deg p by the preceding lemma this number does not depend on the degree function whenever p is a graded poset we denote by obn p the objects of degree n and by homn p the arrows of degree n of the graded poset p more generally definition 1 3 7 let s z and let p be a graded poset with degree function deg then ps is the full subcategory of p with objects p such that deg p s obs p p ob p deg p s and homs p is the set f hom p deg f s 1 3 1 boundedness on graded posets for some results we restrict to definition 1 3 8 a graded poset p with increasing degree function deg is bounded below bounded above if the set deg p z has a lower bound an upper bound if the degree function deg of p is decreasing then p is bounded below bounded above if and only if deg p z has an upper bound a lower bound notice that upper boundedness means that the category p ends if you move in the direction of the arrows and lower boundedness means that p finishes moving in the opposite direction if p is bounded below and over then n def max deg p min deg p exists and is finite by lemma 1 3 4 this number does not depend on the degree function we call it the dimension of p and we say that p is n dimensional example 1 3 9 the pushout category b a c is 1 dimensional the telescope category a b c is bounded below but it is not bounded over the opposite telescope category c b a is bounded over but it is not bounded below notice that in a bounded above below graded poset there are maximal minimal elements but that the existence of maximal minimal objects does not guarantee boundedness remark 1 3 10 when dealing with cohomology some assumptions on a bounded above graded poset p shall be done in particular we shall assume that i p n i p n definition 1 3 7 is finite for each i ob p and that all the maximal elements of p have the same degree 1 3 2 graphs and graded posets let p be a graded poset the undirected graph associated to p has vertices the objects ob p and edges the arrows of degree 1 hom 1 p the directed graph associated to p a has vertices the objects ob p and oriented edges the oriented arrows of degree 1 hom 1 p a graded poset p is a tree if it is associated undirected graph is a tree it contains no cycle a tree or maximal tree of p is a subcategory p such that the undirected subgraph associated to the graded poset p is a tree or maximal tree respectively of the undirected graph associated to p 1 4 simplicial complexes a simplicial complex 15 is a pairk v s where v is a set and s is a collection of finite subsets of v satisfying 34 1 notation and preliminaries 1 s s 2 v v v s elements of v are called vertices and elements of s are called simplices if k v s is a simplicial complex we can associate to it the poset with objects s and inclusion as order relation this poset verify the following property definition 1 4 1 let p be a poset then p is simplex like if for all p ob p the category p p is isomorphic to the poset of all non empty subsets of a finite set with inclusion as order relation in fact 18 3 1 we have that a poset p arises from a simplicial complex as above if and only if it is a simplex like poset and any two elements of p which have a lower bound have an infimum i e a greatest lower bound if the poset p arises from the simplicial complex k v s then there is a map dim p z which assigns to each simplex s s its dimension dim s z if s is a simplex of s then all the subsets of s are in s too this implies that preceding simplices of p differ just in one dimension and thus the function dim is an increasing degree function and p is a graded poset 1 5 realization and homotopy type according to sections 1 3 and 1 4 we have inclusions simplicial complexes graded posets categories on the one hand we can realize in top a simplicial complex k as a space of formal linear combinations appropriately topologized 15 3 on the other hand for a category c we can consider its nerve nc which is a simplicial set nc sset and the realization in top of this simplicial set 15 3 we denote by k and nc the realizations of simplicial complexes and categories respectively for a given simplicial complex k consider the graded poset p associated to it section 1 4 the simplicial complex whose simplices consist of all of the totally ordered subsets of p is exactly the barycentric subdivision 38 3 3 of k sdk by 15 3 4 there are homeomorphisms k sdk np thus as the realization of a simplicial complex k we can consider either of k sdk or np 1 5 1 homotopy type from the homotopy viewpoint restricting to graded posets means no loss proposition 1 5 1 for any space x top there is a graded poset p and a weak homotopy equivalence x np proof it is a well known fact 43 theorem v 3 2 that x has the weak homo topy type of a cw complex in fact by 23 theorem 2 c 5 x also has the weak homotopy type of a simplicial complex k x k by the comments above we have k sdk np for certain graded poset p and thus x np 1 6 derived functors of direct and inverse limit 35 remark 1 5 2 by the proof of the theorem if x is a cw complex then there is a strong homotopy equivalence x np 1 6 derived functors of direct and inverse limit in this section we give definitions for the left derived functors lim i of the direct limit lim abc c and for the right derived functors lim i of the inverse limit lim abc c for any small category c notice 30 ix proposition 3 1 that abc is an abelian category in which the short exact sequences are the object wise ones and that lim and lim are right exact and left exact respectively because they are left adjoint and right adjoint respectively to the functor ab abc which maps a 7 ca it is well known 8 xi 6 1 and its dual that in abc there are enough projec tives and injectives so we can define the derived functors of lim and lim instead of considering projective and injective resolutions for objects of abc the definitions of lim i and lim i we expound here have computational purposes and are based on 17 appendix ii 3 they also appear in 8 xii 5 5 8 xi 6 2 in 19 p 409 ff there is a summary denote by nc the nerve of the

normalization theorem for simplicial abelian groups in order to compute the homology of these it states roughly that the homology of a simplicial abelian group can be computed removing the degenerate simplices the theorem we state below is contained in 31 22 1 22 3 it can be also found in 19 iii 2 1 iii 2 4 let s be a simplicial abelian group and let s 1 idi be the moore chain complex associated to s consider the chain complex ns with n chains nsn n 1 i 0 ker di sn sn 1 and with differential 1 ndn nsn nsn 1 define ds as the chain subcomplex ds of s 1 idi which n chains are generated by the degenerate elements of s that is by the elements in the image of some si theorem 1 7 1 let s be a simplicial abelian group then h s h ns h s ds the dual version for cosimplicial abelian groups appears in 19 viii 1 and 8 x 7 1 let c be a cosimplicial abelian group and consider the cochain complex c 1 idi there is a cochain complex nc with n cochains ncn n 1 i 0 ker si cn cn 1 and with differential 1 idi define dc as the subcomplex of c d 1 idi which n cochains are generated by the elements in the image of some di theorem 1 7 2 let c be a cosimplicial abelian group then h c h nc h c dc remark 1 7 3 we shall apply these theorems to simplicial and cosimplicial abelian groups coming from a diagram as in section 1 6 in fact we shall use the quotient chain complex s ds when dealing with cn c f and the cochain subcomplex nc when dealing with cn c f without explicit mention chapter 2 a spectral sequence in this section we shall construct spectral sequences with targets lim i f and lim i f for f c ab with c a graded poset some conditions for weak convergence shall be given we build the spectral sequences starting from filtered differential modules see 32 where the notion of weak convergence we use is also given first consider the complex c c f d defined in section 1 6 and choose a de creasing degree function deg over the objects of c there is a decreasing filtration of this complex given by lpcn c f ncn deg n p f it is straightforward that the triple c c f d l is a filtered differential graded z module so it yields a spectral sequence e r dr of cohomological type whose differential dr has bidegree r 1 r the e 1 page is given by e p q 1 h p q lpc lp 1 c the differential graded z module lpc lp 1 c is in fact a simplicial abelian group because the face operators di and the degeneracy operators si respect the filtration l the n simplices are lpc lp 1 c n ncn deg n p f moreover for each p lpc lp 1 c can be filtered again by the condition deg 0 p to obtain a homological type spectral sequence then arguing as above we obtain proposition 2 0 4 for a decreasing graded poset and a functor f c ab there exists a cohomological type spectral sequence e with target lim f there exists a homological type spectral sequence ep with target the col umn e p 1 for each p notice that the column e p 1 is given by the cohomology of the simplicial abelian group formed by the simplices that end on objects of degree p the column ep 1 p is given by the homology of the simplicial abelian group formed by the simplices that end on degree p and begin on degree p and all the differentials in the spectral sequences above are induced by the completely described differential of c c f d an advantage of handling simplical abelian groups instead of chain complexes is the chance to use the normalization theorem 1 7 1 39 40 2 a spectral sequence complex degree first second first ss second ss function filtration filtration c c f decreasing deg n deg 0 cohomol type homol type c c f

sequences obtained as p l pcn cn and p l pcn 0 for each n the spectral sequence e converges weakly to its target in case the map deg has a bounded image i e when c is n dimensional the filtration l is bounded below and over and so e collapses after a finite number of pages the same assertions on weak converge and boundedness hold for the spectral sequences ep if we proceed in reverse order i e filtrating first by the degree of the beginning object and later by the degree of the ending object we obtain proposition 2 0 5 for a decreasing graded poset and a functor f c ab there exists a homological type spectral sequence e with target lim f there exists a cohomological type spectral sequence ep with target the column e 1 p for each p if the degree function we take is increasing then the appropriate conditions for the filtrations are deg n p and deg 0 p and the spectral sequences obtained in propositions 2 0 4 and 2 0 5 are of homological cohomological type instead of cohomological homological type for the case of the cochain complex c c f d defined in section 1 6 the choices for the filtrations are deg n p and deg 0 p for a decreasing degree function and deg n p and deg 0 p for an increasing one analogously we obtain spectral sequences with target lim i f which columns in the first page are computed by another spectral sequence in this case we can use the normalization theorem 1 7 2 to compute cohomology of the cosimplicial abelian groups appearing in the page 1 of these spectral sequences table 1 shows a summary of the types of the spectral sequences for all the cases the statements on weak convergence and boundedness apply to any of the spectral sequences of the table remark 2 0 6 recall from remark 1 7 3 the chain cochain complex chosen to normalize a simplicial cosimplicial abelian group it is straightforward that nor malizing the simplicial cosimplicial abelian groups that computes the page 1 of the 2 1 examples 41 spectral sequences above has the same effect as considering the spectral sequences of the normalizations of c c f c c f 2 1 examples next there are some examples that show how the spectral sequences just built work in this section f denotes a covariant functor f p ab where p is a graded poset these examples also serve as preamble to chapters 3 and 4 where conditions are found such that lim i f 0 and lim i f 0 for i 0 respectively the behaviour of the spectral sequences in these examples resembles the general results in this thesis theorems 3 2 3 and 4 2 3 in particular in the pushout example f monic implies lim 1 f 0 compare with definition 3 1 5 remark 3 1 6 and theorem 3 2 3 for the pullback example we have that f epic implies lim 1 f 0 compare with definition 4 1 5 remark 4 1 6 and theorem 4 2 3 the telescope example shows the importance that in a graded poset every morphism factors as composition of morphisms of degree 1 compare with step 1 in the proof of theorem 3 2 3 finally the cycle example shows that the existence of cycles in p may prevent lim 1 f 0 compare with corollaries 3 3 12 and 3 4 10 in this example also appears a heuristic version of pseudo projectiveness definition 3 1 5 this property is related theorem 3 2 3 to the vanishing of lim i f example 2 1 1 pushout consider p the pushout category a b f oo g c this category is a graded poset with increasing degree function indicated by the subscripts a 1 b 0 f oo g c 1 although in this case it is trivial to compute the derived functors we apply the earlier propositions to have a taste of it so we filter by the ending object n to obtain a homological type spectral sequence e converging to lim i f we do not filter a second time since this case is too simple the column e 1 p is given by the homology of a simplicial abelian group in fact by theorem 1 7 1 e 11 is the homology of the quotient chain complex of non degenerated simplices ending in degree 1 that is the homology of 0 0 ff fg f f f g fa fc analogously e 10 is the homology of the quotient chain complex of non degenerated simplices ending in degree 0 that is the homology of 0 0 fb 42 2 a spectral sequence so the page e 1 looks like 0 0 0 0 0 fb ker f f f g d 1 oo 0 0 0 coker f f f g 0 0 0 0 0 oo and the only nontrivial differential d 1 is the restriction of df b idf b f b f b f b it is clear that the spectral sequence collapses at e 2 clearly lim i f 0 for i 2 notice that if f f and f g are monomorphisms then e 11 0 0 and lim 1 f 0 the extension problem for lim 0 f lim f gives the short exact sequence 0 f b ker f f ker f g lim f coker f f f g coker f f f g 0 using any of the spectral sequences for lim i f it is straightforward that lim if f b for i 0 0 if i 1 example 2 1 2 pullback consider p the pullback category c g a f b this category is a graded poset with decreasing degree function indicated by the subscripts c 1 g a 1 f b 0 we filter by the initial object 0 to obtain a cohomological type spectral sequence e converging to lim i f the column e p 1 is given theorem 1 7 2 by the cohomol ogy of the normalized cochain complex of simplices beginning in degree p so e 1 1 is the cohomology of 0 f f f g 0 oo f a f c f f f g oo and e 0 1 the cohomology of 0 f b 0 oo 2 1 examples 43 so the page e 1 looks like 0 0 0 0 0 f b d 1 coker f f f g 0 0 0 ker f f f g 0 0 0 0 0 oo and the only nontrivial differential d 1 is induced by idf b idf b f b f b f b the spectral sequence collapses at e 2 notice that if f f and f g are epimorphisms then e 1 0 1 0 and lim 1 f 0 the extension problem for lim 0 f lim f gives the short exact sequence 0 ker f f f g lim f ker f f f g im f f im f g 0 for lim i f it holds that lim i f f b for i 0 0 if i 1 example 2 1 3 telescope consider p the telescope category a 0 f 1 a 1 f 2 a 2 f 3 a 3 f 4 a 4 where the subscript indicates the name of the object and the value of an increasing degree function which makes p a graded poset the same homological type spectral sequence of the pushout example for lim i f has as column e 1 p the homology of the normalized chain complex of simplices ending in degree p these chain complexes become more and more complicated as p grows to get more insight we filter a second time by the condition deg 0 p to obtain for each p a cohomological type spectral sequence ep converging to e 1 p the column ep p is given by the homology of the simplicial abelian group formed by the simplices that end on degree p and begin on degree p we want to have a look at lim 1 f here we write an informal discussion for precise statements look at the proof of theorem 3 2 3 the contributions to lim 1 f from the second spectral sequence for p p come from the homology at degree 1 of normalized chain complexes d f f ap d 0 where ap fp fp 1 ap with p p if p p 1 for x f p take the 2 chain y i x where ap fp 1 ap 1 fp fp 2 ap 44 2 a spectral sequence then d y d 0 y d 1 y d 2 y 0 x 0 x and so if p p 1 there is no contribution to lim 1 f notice that the key fact in the argument above is that every morphism of degree greater than 1 can be written as composition of morphisms of degree 1 notice that at this point the calculus of lim 1 f have been simplified a lot the computation of lim 1 f is simplified too in this case the contributions to lim 1 f come from the cohomology of normalized cochain complexes f f ap doo 0 doo where ap fp fp 1 ap with p p for p p 1 if x f p is a cohomological class then d x 0 and so d x x 0 where ap fp 1 ap 1 fp fp 2 ap thus if p p 1 there is no contribution to lim 1 f example 2 1 4 cycle consider p the following category a g f c b h i d it is a graded poset with increasing degree function a 1 g b bb bb bb b f c 2 b 1 h i d 2 the associated undirected graph has a cycle a direct computation shows that lim 1 f consists of the tuples xf xg xh xi ff fg fh fi f a f a f b f b such that xf xg 0 f f xf f h xh 0 xh xi 0 and f g xg f i xi 0 this system of equations may have non trivial solutions for example if we consider the constant functor f cz then lim 1 f h 1 np h 1 s 1 z and so the solution is cyclic infinite what happens if we add an initial object e to p a 1 g 1 11 11 11 11 11 11 1 f c 2 e j k b 1 h ff i d 2 2 1 examples 45 in case f is the constant functor of value z then lim 1 f is the first group of homology of the cone over s 1 which is a contractible space and so lim 1 f 0 what happens for an arbitrary f the image by the differential from c 2 p f to c 1 p f of the tuple xjf xjg xkh xki fjf fjg fkh fki f e f e f e f e is the tuple f j xjf f j xjg f k xkh f k xki xjg xjg xkh xki xjf xkh xjg xki of ff fg fh fi fj fk ff j fi k which equals f a f a f b f b f e f e f e f e applying the arguments of the preceding examples we have that for a class xf xg xh xi xj xk xf j xi k in the kernel of the differential at c 1 p f we can take xf j xi k 0 because f j and i k can be factored by morphisms of lower degree xj xk 0 if f j and f k are monomorphisms as j and k are the only arrows arriving to their ending objects so supposing that f j and f k are monomorphisms we can take as representative of a class in the kernel a tuple xf xg xh xi 0 0 0 0 such that xf xg 0 f f xf f h xh 0 xh xi 0 and f g xg f i xi 0 as before now suppose that for every xa f a and every xb f b such that f f xa f h xb there exists xe f e such that f j xe xa and f k xe xb this condition is natural as it is related with the projectiveness of f in abp cf section 3 1 for a tuple xf xg xh xi 0 0 0 0 in the kernel we have that f f xf f h xh and so by hypothesis exists xe f e with f j xe xf and f k xe xh take now the 2 chain of c 2 p f y xe xe xe xe then the differential of y is xf xf xh xh xe xe xe xe xe xe xe xe which equals xf xg xh xi 0 0 0 0 thus with these assumptions lim 1 f 0 chapter 3 higher direct limits 3 1 projective objects in abp consider the abelian category abp for some graded poset p in this section we shall determine the projective objects in abp one of the main features of projective objects is that derived functors vanish on them recall that in ab the projective objects are well known and are exactly the free abelian groups along the rest of the section p denotes a graded poset suppose f abp is projective how does f look consider i 0 ob p we show that the quotient of f i 0 by the images of the non identity morphisms arriving to i 0 is projective to prove it write definition 3 1 1 im i 0 i i 0 6 1 i 0 imf or im i 0 0 if the index set of the sum is empty and coker i 0 f i 0 im i 0 let f abp be a projective functor for any diagram in ab as the following coker i 0 0 0 zzu u u u u a 0 0 b 0 0 we want to find 0 that makes it commutative consider the atomic functors a b p ab which take the values on objects a i a 0 for i i 0 0 for i 6 i 0 b i b 0 for i i 0 0 for i 6 i 0 and on morphisms a 1 a 0 for 1 i 0 0 for 6 1 i 0 b 1 b 0 for 1 i 0 0 for 6 1 i 0 and the natural transformations f b and a b given by i 0 p for i i 0 0 for i 6 i 0 47 48 3 higher direct limits i 0 for i i 0 0 for i 6 i 0 where p is the projection f i 0 coker i 0 a b 0 is exact as a 0 0 b 0 0 is it is straightforward that is a natural transformation the key point in checking that is a natural transformation is that for i 1 i 0 6 1 i 0 the diagram f i 1 f i 1 f i 0 0 p b i 1 0 b 0 must commute and it does because p f 0 for every 6 1 i 0 so as f is projective this data gives a natural transformation which makes commutative the diagram of natural transformations f a 3 b 3 0 which restricts over i 0 to f i 0 p i 0 coker i 0 0 0 zzu u u u u a 0 0 b 0 0 then 0 exists if and only if ker p im i 0 ker i 0 to check that this condition holds take x j 1 k f j xj in im i 0 for 1 i 0 6 j ij i 0 j 1 k then i 0 x j 1 k i 0 f j xj j 1 k a j ij xj j 1 k a j 0 0 we have just proven lemma 3 1 2 let f p ab be a projective functor over a graded poset p then coker i 0 is projective for every object i 0 ob p this means that we can write f i 0 im i 0 coker i 0 with coker i 0 free for every i 0 ob p and also that example 3 1 3 for the category p with shape 3 1 projective objects in ab p 49 the functor f p ab with values z n z is not projective as coker on the right object equals the non free abelian group z n now that we know a little about the values that a projective functor f p ab takes on objects we can wonder about the values f for hom p do they have any special property recall that a feature of graded posets is that there is at most one arrow between any two objects and also that remark 3 1 4 if p is graded then for any i 0 ob p im i 0 i i 0 deg 1 imf because every morphism factors as composition of morphisms of degree 1 we prove that the following property holds for f definition 3 1 5 let f p ab be a functor over a graded poset p with degree function deg given d 0 we say that f is d pseudo projective if for any i 0 ob p and k different objects ij ob p arrows j ij i 0 with deg j d and xj f ij j 1 k such that j 1 k f j xj 0 we have that xj im ij j 1 k if f is d pseudo projective for each d 0 we call f pseudo projective remark 3 1 6 in case k 1 and im i 1 0 the condition states that f 1 is a monomorphism notice that any functor is 0 pseudo projective as the identity is a monomorphism before proving that projective functors f over a graded poset verify this property we define two functors coker and coker and natural transformations and that fit in the diagram f coker 3 coker 3 0 for any functor f p ab with p a graded poset we begin defining coker because for every i 1 i 0 holds that f im i 1 im i 0 we can factor f as in the diagram f i 1 f f i 0 coker i 1 f coker i 0 50 3 higher direct limits in fact if 6 1 i 1 then f 0 by definition because the identity 1 i 0 cannot be factorized by non identity morphisms in a graded poset then we have a functor coker with value coker i on the object i of p and which maps the non identity morphisms to zero coker is a kind of discrete functor also it is clear that there exists a natural transformation f coker with i the projection f i coker i now we define coker from coker in a similar way as free diagrams are constructed let coker be defined on objects by coker i 0 i i 0 coker i for hom p i 1 i 0 coker is the only homomorphism which makes commute the diagram coker i 1 coker coker i 0 coker i oo 1 coker i oo for each i i 1 in the bottom row of the diagram the direct summands coker i of coker i 1 and coker i 0 correspond to i i 1 and to the composition i i 1 i 0 respectively then there exists a candidate to natural transformation coker coker which value i is the projection i coker i coker i onto the direct summand corresponding to 1 i i i thus is a natural transformation if for every i 1 i 0 with i 1 6 i 0 the following diagram is commutative coker i 1 i 1 coker coker i 0 i 0 coker i 1 0 coker i 0 it is clear that this square commutes if the identity 1 i 0 cannot be factorized by non identity morphisms and this holds in a graded poset now we have the commutative triangle f u s s s s s s s s s s coker 3 coker 3 0 where the natural transformation exists because f is projective to prove that f is d pseudo projective for some d 0 take i 0 ob p k objects i 1 ik arrows j ij i 0 with deg j d and elements xj f ij for j 1 k such that j 1 k f j xj 0 3 1 projective objects in ab p 51 to visualize what is going on consider the diagram above near i 0 for k 2 f i 1 uuk k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k f 1 m mm mm mm mm m

f j xj j 1 k coker j ij xj now consider the projection pj 0 for j 0 1 k from coker i 0 onto the direct summand coker ij 0 coker i 0 which corresponds to j 0 ij 0 i 0 coker i 0 pj 0 coker ij 0 then 1 0 pj 0 0 pj 0 i 0 0 j 1 k pj 0 coker j ij xj for any y i ij y coker yj pj 0 coker j y i ij j j 0 y so if yj ij xj i ij yj coker ij then pj 0 coker j ij xj i ij j j 0 yj this last sum runs over ij 0 ij such that the following triangle commutes ij 0 j 0 i 0 ij j because we are in a graded poset and deg ij d for each j 1 k then the only chance is ij ij 0 and 1 ij 0 because the objects i 1 ik are different this implies that j j 0 too thus pj 0 coker j ij xj yj 0 1 ij 0 for j j 0 0 for j 6 j 0 52 3 higher direct limits and equation 1 becomes 0 pj 0 0 yj 0 1 ij 0 notice now that yj 0 1 ij 0 is the evaluation of ij 0 on yj 0 ij 0 xj 0 and then 0 yj 0 1 ij 0 ij 0 ij 0 xj 0 ij 0 xj 0 this last equation means that xj 0 goes to zero by the projection f ij 0 coker ij 0 f ij 0 im ij 0 and then xij 0 im ij 0 as j 0 was arbitrary this completes the proof of lemma 3 1 7 let f p ab be a projective functor over a graded poset p then f is pseudo projective example 3 1 8 for the category p with shape the functor f p ab with values z redn z n is not projective as redn is not injective in spite of the coker s are z and 0 which are free abelian now we define pre projective objects definition 3 1 9 let f p ab be a functor over a graded poset p we call f pre projective if 1 for any i 0 ob p coker i 0 is projective 2 f is pseudo projective till now we have obtained that projective functors p ab over graded posets are pre projective in fact as the next proposition shows the restriction we did to graded posets is worthwhile proposition 3 1 10 let f p ab be a pre projective functor over a graded poset p if p is bounded below then f is projective proof we can suppose that the degree function deg on p is increasing and takes values 0 1 2 3 and that ob 0 p 6 to see that f is proyective in abp given a diagram of functors with exact row as shown we must find a natural transformation f a making the diagram commutative f a 3 b 3 0 we define inductively beginning on objects of degree 0 and successively on object of degrees 1 2 3 3 1 projective objects in ab p 53 so take i 0 ob 0 p of degree 0 and restrict to the diagram in ab over i 0 by definition 3 1 9 as im i 0 0 f i 0 coker i 0 is projective so we can close the following triangle with a homomorphism i 0 f i 0 i 0 i 0 w w w w w a i 0 i 0 b i 0 0 as there are no arrows between degree 0 objects we do not worry about being a natural transformation now suppose that we have defined on all objects of p of degree less than n n 1 and that the restriction of to the full subcategory generated by these objects is a natural transformation and verifies the next step is to define on degree n objects so take i 0 obn p and consider the splitting f i 0 im i 0 coker i 0 where im i 0 i i 0 deg 1 imf to define i 0 such that it makes commutative the diagram im i 0 coker i 0 i 0 i 0 wwn n n n n n n a i 0 i 0 b i 0 0 we define it on im i 0 and coker i 0 separately for coker i 0 as it is a projective abelian group we define it by any homomorphism that makes commutative the di agram above when restricted to coker i 0 for im i 0 take x j 1 k f j xj where i 1 ik are k different objects j ij i 0 deg j 1 and xj f ij for j 1 k see remark 3 1 4 then define i 0 x j 1 k a j ij xj to check that i 0 x does not depend on the choice of the ij s j s and xj s we have to prove that j 1 k f j xj 0 j 1 k a j ij xj 0 so suppose that 2 j 1 k f j xj 0 54 3 higher direct limits then using that f is 1 pseudo projective and remark 3 1 4 we obtain objects ij j arrows j j of degree 1 and elements xj j for j 1 k j 1 kj such that 3 j 1 kj f j j xj j xj for every j 1 k notice that possibly not all the objects ij j are different replacing equation 3 in equation 2 we obtain 4 j 1 k j 1 kj f j j j xj j 0 because in a graded poset there is at most one arrow between two objects the con dition ij j ij j i implies j j j j j j i i 0 so considering objects i ob p we can rewrite 4 as 5 i ob p f j j j j j ij j i xj j 0 call i 1 i m ij j j 1 k j 1 kj where these sets have m elements call l j j j if i l ij j and yl j j ij j i l xj j for l 1 m notice that deg l 2 for each l then equation 5 becomes 6 l 1 m f l yl 0 now we repeat the same argument applying that f is 2 pseudo projective and the remark 3 1 4 to equation 6 we obtain objects i l l arrows l l of degree 1 and elements yl l for l 1 m l 1 k l such that 7 l 1 k l f l l yl l yl for every l 1 m substituting 7 in 6 l 1 m l 1 k l f l l l yl l 0 now proceed as before regrouping the terms in this last equation in a finite number of steps after a regrouping of terms as above we find objects i s arrows s and elements zs of degree 0 for s 1 r which verify an equation 8 s 1 r f s zs 0 then pseudo injectivity gives that zs im i s for each s as deg i s 0 then im i s 0 and so zs 0 notice that zs 0 for s 1 r does not imply xj 0 for any j recall that we want to prove that 9 j 1 k a j ij xj 0 3 1 projective objects in ab p 55 substituting 3 in j 1 k a j ij xj we obtain j 1 k a j ij xj j 1 k j 1 kj a j ij f j j xj j j 1 k j 1 kj a j a j j ij j xj j j 1 k j 1 kj a j j j ij j xj j as is natural up to degree less than n then regrouping terms j 1 k j 1 kj a j j j ij j xj j i ob p a j j j ij j j j ij j i xj j l 1 m a l i l yl then after a finite number of steps we obtain j 1 k a j ij xj s 1 r a s i s zs 0 as zs 0 for each z 1 r so we have checked that i 0 x does not depend on the choice of ij j and xj it is straightforward that i 0 on im i 0 defined in this way is a homomorphism of abelian groups it remains to prove that i 0 i 0 i 0 when restricted to im i 0 so take x j 1 k f j xj in im i 0 then i 0 i 0 x j 1 k i 0 a j ij xj j 1 k b j ij ij xj is a natural transformation j 1 k b j ij xj by the inductive hypothesis j 1 k i 0 f j xj is a natural transformation i 0 x defining i 0 in this way for every i 0 obn p we have now defined on all objects of p of degree less or equal than n finally to complete the inductive step we have to prove that restricted to the full subcategory over these objects is a natural transformation take i i 0 in this full subcategory if the degree of i 0 is less 56 3 higher direct limits than n then the commutativity of f i f i f i 0 i 0 a i a a i 0 is granted by the inductive hypothesis suppose that the degree of i 0 is n take x f i because p is graded there exists 1 i 1 i 0 of degree 1 and i i 1 such that 1 i i 0 i 1 1 write x f x f 1 x 1 where x 1 f x then by definition of i 0 on im i 0 i 0 x a 1 i 1 x 1 a 1 i 1 f x a 1 i 1 f x a 1 i x is natural up to degree less than n a i x and so the diagram commutes remark 3 1 11 as the following example shows the condition of lower boundedness of p in theorem 3 1 10 cannot be dropped consider the inverse telescope category p with shape it is a graded poset which is not bounded below consider the functor of constant value z p cz p p ab z p z p z p it is straightforward that it is a pre projective functor as all the cokernels are zero and all the arrows are injective but it is not a projective object of abp because in that case the adjoint pair c ab ab p lim would give that z p is projective in ab right adjoints preserve projectives see 13 3 2 ex 7 thus for the categories that are graded and bounded below we have the useful corollary 3 1 12 let p be a bounded below graded poset and let f p ab be a functor then f is projective if and only if it is pre projective this corollary yields the following examples the degree functions deg for the bounded below graded posets appearing in the examples are indicated by subscripts ideg i on the objects i ob p and take values 0 1 2 3 3 2 pseudo projectivity 57 example 3 1 13 for the pushout category p with shape a 0 f g b 1 c 1 a functor f p ab is projective if and only if f a f b imf f and f c imf g are free abelian f f and f g are monomorphisms example 3 1 14 for the telescope category p with shape a 0 f 1 a 1 f 2 a 2 f 3 a 3 f 4 a 4 a functor f p ab is projective if and only if f a 0 is free abelian f ai imf fi is free abelian f fi fi 1 f 0 is a monomorphism and kerf fi fi 1 fi d imf fi d 1 for d 0 1 i 1 for each i 1 2 3 4 3 2 pseudo projectivity consider a functor f p ab over a graded poset p in this section we look for and find conditions on f such that lim i f 0 for i 1 i e we want conditions such that the left derived functors of the right exact functor lim vanish on f fix the following notation definition 3 2 1 let p be a graded poset and f p ab we say f is lim acyclic if lim i f 0 for i 1 recall that for projective objects it holds that any left derived functor vanishes so from proposition 3 1 10 we obtain firstly that proposition 3 2 2 let f p ab be a pre projective functor over a bounded below graded poset p then f is lim acyclic because being lim acyclic is clearly weaker that being projective we can wonder if is it possible to weaken the hypothesis on proposition 3 2 2 keeping the thesis of lim acyclicity the answer is yes and the following theorem states the appropriate conditions notice that we have removed the condition 1 of definition 3 1 9 theorem 3 2 3 let f p ab be a pseudo projective functor over a bounded below graded poset p then f is lim acyclic proof we can suppose that the degree function deg on p is increasing and takes values 0 1 2 3 and that ob 0 p 6 to compute lim t f we use the normalized remark 2 0 6 spectral sequences corresponding to the third row of table 1 in chapter 2 that is we first filter by the degree of the end object of each 58 3 higher direct limits simplex to obtain a homological type spectral sequence e to compute the column e 1 p we filter by the degree of the initial object of each object to obtain cohomological type spectral sequences ep fix t 1 notice that to prove that lim t f 0 is enough to show that e 1 p t p is zero for every p the contributions to e 1 p t p come from ep p p p t for p p t we are using normalized remark 2 0 6 spectral sequences we prove that ep p p p t r 0 if r is big enough for each p and p p t this implies that lim t f 0 consider the increasing filtration l of c p f that gives rise to the spectral sequence e the n simplices are lpn l pcn p f npn deg n p f for each p we have a decreasing filtration m p of the quotient l p lp 1 that gives rise to the spectral sequence ep and which n simplices are mp p n npn deg 0 p deg n p f for p p t the abelian group ep p q r at the t p q p simplices is given by ep p q r mp p t d 1 mp p r t 1 mp p 1 t d 1 mp p r t 1 mp p t d mp p r 1 t 1 where d is the differential of the quotient lp lp 1 restricted to the subgroups of the filtration mp for r p p t 1 there are not t 1 simplices beginning in degree at least p r p t 1 and ending in degree p i e mp p r t 1 0 because p is bounded below for r big enough mp p r 1 t 1 mp 0 t 1 l p lp 1 t 1 i e mp p r 1 t 1 equals all the t 1 simplices that end on degree p thus there exists r such that 10 ep p q r mp p t d 1 0 mp p 1 t d 1 0 mp p t d mp 0 t 1 fix such an r and take x ep p q r where 11 x npt deg 0 p deg t p x and d x 0 notice that by definition there is just a finite number of summands x 6 0 in the expression 11 for x we prove that x 0 in three steps step 1 in this first step we find a representative x for x x npt deg 0 p deg t p x such that deg 1 1 for every 0 1 1 2 t 1 t 1 t t with x 6 0 3 2 pseudo projectivity 59 take such that x 6 0 and suppose that deg 1 1 i e deg 0 deg 1 1 then as in a graded poset every morphism factors as composition of degree 1 morphisms there exists an object of degree deg 0 deg deg 1 and arrows 1 0 and 2 1 with 1 2 1 2 c cc cc cc c 0 1 1 1 call to the t 1 simplex 0 1 1 1 2 t 1 t 1 t t and consider the t 1 chain of mp 0 t 1 y i x its differential in l p lp 1 equals d y d 0 y d 1 y i 2 t 1 idi y d 0 y i x i 2 t 1 idi y notice that the first morphisms appearing in the simplices d 0 and di for i 2 t have degree deg 2 and deg 1 respectively which are strictly less than deg 1 also notice that d y mp p t d mp 0 t 1 which is zero in equation 10 taking the finite sum of the chains y for each term x we find that x x where x npt deg 0 p deg t p x and the maximum of the degrees of the morphisms 1 of the simplices 0 1 1 2 t 1 t 1 t t with x 6 0 is smaller than this maximum computed for x so repeating this process a finite number of times we find a representative as wished for simplicity we write also x for this representative step 2 by step 1 we can suppose that deg 1 1 for every 0 1 1 2 t 1 t 1 t t with x 6 0 now our objective is to find a representative x for x x npt deg 0 p deg t p x i e such that the expression for x runs over simplices with begin in degree p begin writing x as x i p p t xi where xi npt deg 0 i deg t p x 60 3 higher direct limits notice that the index i just goes to p t and not to p because we are using normalized remark 2 0 6 spectral sequences now we prove claim 3 2 3 1 for each i from i p t to i p there exists a representative x i for x x i npt i deg 0 p deg t p x i such that 12 x i 6 0 and deg 0 i imply deg 1 1 notice that taking i p in the claim the step 2 is finished the case i p t in the claim is fulfilled taking x p t x by step 1 suppose the statement of the claim holds for i then we prove it for i 1 we have x i such that x i npt i deg 0 p deg t p x i d x i 0 and x x i the differential d on l p lp 1 restricts to d mp p t mp p t 1 and carries z f npt deg 0 p deg t p f mp p t to d z j 0 1 t 1 1 jdj z with dj z fdj mp p t 1 notice that the initial object of dj is 1 for j 0 and 0 for j 1 t 1 also notice that the final object of dj is t for j 0 t 1 by hypothesis d x i 0 so for every np t 1 with deg 0 p and deg t 1 p we can apply the projection mp p t 1 f and obtain d x i 0 if deg 0 i then the remarks on the differential above and condition 12 imply that d x i npt deg 0 i d 0 f 1 x i and thus 13 0 npt deg 0 i d 0 f 1 x i for each np t 1 with deg 0 i and deg t 1 p notice that each summand x i with np t deg 0 i and deg p appears in one and just one equation as 13 take d 0 fix an np t 1 with deg 0 i and deg t 1 p and consider the associated equation 13 then as f is i deg 0 pseudo projective x i im 0 for every np t with deg 0 i and d 0 this means that for every such a there 3 2 pseudo projectivity 61 exists k objects of degree i 1 namely i 1 i k arrows j i j 0 and elements xj f i j for j 1 k such that 14 x i j 1 k f j x j consider the t 1 simplices for j 1 k j ij j 0 1 1 2 t 1 t 1 t t and the t 1 chain of mp i 1 t 1 y j 1 k i j x j the differential of y is d y d 0 y j 1 t 1 jdj y d 0 y r where r j 1 t 1 jdj y j 1 k id 0 j f j x j r j 1 k i f j x j r i j 1 k f j x j r i x i r where the last equality is due to 14 notice that r lives in the subgroup npt deg 0 i 1 deg t p f mp p t of simplices beginning at degree i 1 re peating the same construction for each np t with deg 0 i and d 0 we obtain y y such that d y np t deg 0 i d 0 x i r where r lives in the subgroup npt deg 0 i 1 deg t p f mp p t repeating the same argument for every np t 1 with deg 0 i and deg t 1 p we obtain y y such that d y np t deg 0 i d 0 t p x i r where r lives in the subgroup npt deg 0 i 1 deg t p f mp p t by con struction y mp i 1 t 1 mp 0 t 1 and d y mp i 1 t mp p t 1 thus d y mp p t d mp 0 t 1 then by 10 x i x i d y x i 1 where x i 1 npt i deg 0 p d 0 t p x i r 62 3 higher direct limits is a representative that lives in npt i 1 deg 0 p deg t p f mp p t as wished that condition 12 holds is clear from the definition of x i 1 step 3 by step 2 we can suppose that x npt deg 0 p deg t p x our objective now is to see that there exists y mp 0 t 1 with d y x this implies that x 0 and finishes the proof of the theorem we need the claim 3 2 3 2 there exist chains xi mp 0 t for i p 0 and yi mp 0 t 1 for i p 1 such that 15 d yi xi xi 1 for i p 1 with xp x and x 0 0 such that 1 xi lives on npt deg 0 i deg t p f mp 0 t for i p 0 2 d xi 0 for i p 0 notice that the claim finishes step 3 as x 0 0 then x 1 d y 1 x 2 d y 2 x 1 d y 2 y 1 x 3 d y 3 x 2 d y 3 y 2 y 1 x xp d yp xp 1 d yp yp 1 1 p 1 y 1 where yp yp 1 1 p 1 y 1 mp 0 t 1 define xp def x then condition 1 and 2 are satisfied for i p we construct yi and xi 1 from xi recursively beginning on i p the arguments are similar to those used in step 2 the differential d on lp lp 1 restricts to d mp 0 t mp 0 t 1 as d xp d x 0 for every np t 1 with deg t 1 p we can apply the projection mp 0 t 1 f and obtain d x 0 if deg 0 p then d x npt d 0 f 1 x and thus 16 0 npt d 0 f 1 x for each np t 1 with deg 0 p and deg t 1 p notice that each summand x with np t deg 0 p and deg p appears in one and just one equation as 16 take d 0 using now pseudo injectivity we build as before y y y 3 3 computing higher limits 63 and y y where runs over np t 1 with deg 0 p and deg t 1 p such that d y x r with r living in npt deg 0 p 1 deg t p f mp 0 t call yp def y and xp 1 r then equation 15 is satisfied condition 1 for i p 1 holds by the construction of r and condition 2 for i p 1 holds because d xp 1 d r d d y x d 2 y d x 0 0 0 as d is a differential and d x 0 by hypothesis the construction of yi and xi 1 from xi is totally analogous to the construction of yp and xp 1 from xp that we have just made after we have built y 1 and x 0 if we try to build y y and r from x 0 we find that because there are not objects of negative degree thus if z im i where deg i 0 then z 0 x 0 0 the following examples come from example 3 1 13 they show the weaker conditions that are needed for lim acyclicity instead of projectiveness example 3 2 4 for the pushout category p with shape a 0 f g b 1 c 1 a functor f p ab is lim acyclic if f f and f g are monomorphisms for the telescope category p with shape a 0 f 1 a 1 f 2 a 2 f 3 a 3 f 4 a 4 a functor f p ab is lim acyclic if f fi fi 1 f 1 is a monomorphism and kerf fi fi 1 fi d 1 imf fi d for d 1 2 3 i 1 for each i 2 3 4 notice that for this is enough that f fi is a monomorphism for each i 1 2 3 3 3 computing higher limits theorem 3 2 3 shows that over a bounded below graded poset pseudo projectivity is enough for lim acyclicity but it turns out that pseudo projectivity is not necessary for lim acyclicity example 3 3 1 for the pullback category p with shape a 0 f b 0 g c 1 a functor f p ab is pseudo projective if f f and f g are monomorphisms imf f imf g 0 64 3 higher direct limits but a straightforward calculus shows lim i f 0 for i 1 for any f this shows that pseudo projectivity is not necessary for lim acyclicity however we shall see how pseudo projectivity allows us to obtain a better knowledge of the higher limits lim i f we begin with definition 3 3 2 let f p ab be a functor over a graded poset p f p ab is the functor which takes values on objects f i 0 i i 0 f i for i 0 ob p for hom p i 1 i 0 f is the only homomorphism which makes commute the diagram f i 1 f f i 0 f i i i 1 oo 1 f i i i 1 i 0 oo for each i i 1 f is built from f as coker was built from coker in section 3 1 it mimics the construction of free objects in abp notice that cokerf i f i for each i ob p a nice property of f is lemma 3 3 3 let f p ab be a functor over a graded poset then for each g abp there is a bijection homabp f g i ob p homab f i g i proof is given by f g i f i i 1 i i f i i g i for a family i i ob p i ob p homset f i g i define the natural trans formation f g on the object i 0 ob p as the only homomorphism which makes commute the diagram f i 0 i 0 f i 0 f i i i 0 oo i g i g oo for every i i 0 then both compositions and are the identity another interesting property of f is the following 3 3 computing higher limits 65 lemma 3 3 4 let f p ab be a functor over a graded poset then lim f i ob p f i proof it is straightforward using the previous lemma notice that the cone f lim f is given by the homomorphisms i 0 for each i 0 ob p which make commutative the diagrams f i 0 i 0 i ob p f i f i i i 0 oo 1 f i oo for each i i 0 this description shall be useful later the main feature of f we shall use is lemma 3 3 5 let f p ab be a functor over a graded poset then f is pseudo projective proof take k objects ij ob p arrows j ij i 0 with deg j d and yj f ij j 1 k such that j 1 k f j yj 0 in f i 0 we want that yj imf ij for j 1 k write yj i ij yj fix j 0 1 k and consider the projection pj 0 from f i 0 onto the direct summand f ij 0 f i 0 which corresponds to j 0 ij 0 i 0 f i 0 pj 0 f ij 0 for any y i ij y f yj pj 0 f j y i ij j j 0 y so for yj i ij yj f ij we have pj 0 f j yj i ij j j 0 yj this last sum runs over ij 0 ij such that the following triangle commutes ij 0 j 0 i 0 ij j 66 3 higher direct limits because we are in a graded poset and deg ij d for each j 1 k then the only chance is ij ij 0 and 1 ij 0 because the objects i 1 ik are different this implies that j j 0 too thus pj 0 f j yj yj 0 1 ij 0 for j j 0 0 for j 6 j 0 then 0 pj 0 j 1 k f j yj pj 0 j 1 k f j yj j 1 k pj 0 f j yj yj 0 1 ij 0 as j 0 was arbitrary this means that yj 1 ij 0 for each j 1 k now it is clear by the definition of f that yj imf ij for j 1 k remark 3 3 6 the epic natural transformation g f where g z u f with u ab set the forgetful functor and z set ab the free abelian group on a set is the usual way to prove that abc has enough projectives for any small category c by lemma 3 3 3 for the family of homomorphisms f i 1 f i f i i ob p we have a natural transformation f f it is clear that f f 0 is exact in abp thus we can consider the object wise kernel of f f to obtain a short exact sequence of functors 0 kf f f 0 if p is bounded below then the long exact sequence see section 1 6 associated to this short exact sequence gives lim j f lim j 1 kf j 1 ker lim kf lim f j 1 because f is lim acyclic it is pseudo projective by lemma 3 3 5 and apply theorem 3 2 3 so writing k 0 def f and k 1 def kf we have lim 1 f ker lim k 1 lim k 0 where the map lim k 1 lim k 0 comes from the long exact sequence of derived functors associated to a short exact sequence 0 k 1 k 0 k 0 0 3 3 computing higher limits 67 also we obtained that lim j f lim j 1 k 1 for j 2 and that lim k 0 i ob p k 0 i thus applying the same machinery to the functor k 1 we have a short exact sequence 0 k 2 k 1 k 1 0 and lim 2 f lim 1 k 1 ker lim k 2 lim k 1 with lim k 1 i ob p k 1 i recursively we obtain short exact sequences 0 kj k j 1 kj 1 0 and lim j f lim j 1 k 1 lim j 2 k 2 lim 1 kj 1 ker lim kj lim k j 1 for every j 1 where lim k j 1 i ob p kj 1 i lemma 3 3 7 let p be a bounded below graded poset and f p ab a functor then there are functors kj p ab for j 0 1 2 with k 0 f and k 1 ker f f such that lim j f lim j 1 k 1 lim j 2 k 2 lim 1 kj 1 ker lim kj lim k j 1 for each j 0 1 2 the values f i 0 and kf i 0 can be very big because they contain a copy of f i for each i i 0 this can be improved considering the functor coker p ab in section 3 1 suppose that for every i 0 there is a section si 0 coker i 0 f i 0 to the projection f i 0 coker i 0 for example if coker i 0 is free for each i 0 or if f is an epic functor then by lemma 3 3 3 there is a natural transformation coker f if p is bounded below then it is easy to see by induction on the degree of objects that this natural transformation is object wise surjective notice that coker i 0 is in general smaller than f i 0 lemma 3 3 8 let p be a bounded below graded poset and let f p ab be an epic functor then there is a short exact sequence of functors 0 k coker f 0 where coker is lim acyclic we finish this section with some examples of lim acyclic functors example 3 3 9 let p be a graded poset with initial object i 0 then p is contractible and thus hi p m 0 for i 1 and any trivial coefficients m ab we can prove this by taking the functor fm p ab which takes the value m on i 0 and 0 otherwise then fm p ab is the functor of constant value m and thus hi p m lim i fm for i 0 these higher limits vanish for i 1 because fm is pseudo projective lemma 3 3 5 finally h 0 p m lim 0 fm m by lemma 3 3 4 68 3 higher direct limits definition 3 3 10 let p be graded poset we say p is a rooted tree if p is a tree and p has a initial object example 3 3 11 the category with shape a c e b d f g is a tree but not a rooted tree the category with shape d a b e c is a rooted tree corollary 3 3 12 let p be a rooted tree then any monic functor f p ab is lim acyclic proof just check that a monic functor f p ab over a rooted tree p is pseudo projective example 3 3 13 any monic functor over the push out category or the telescope category is lim acyclic 3 4 lim 1 as a flow problem in this section we give an interpretation of the first derived limit lim 1 f in terms of flow problems while in classical flows on directed graphs see 6 iii 1 a non negative integer is associated to each edge i 0 i 1 we associate a value from the abelian group f i 0 here f is a functor f p ab and p is a graded poset notice that by section 3 3 all the higher limits lim i f can be reduced to first derived functors lim 1 ki 1 for suitable ki 1 recall definition 1 6 1 it is straightforward that lim 1 f equals a quotient m n where n m are abelian subgroups of i 0 i 1 np 1 f i 0 notice thatnp 1 hom p and that an element x x hom p of i 0 i 1 np 1 f i 0 belongs to m just in case i i 0 f x i 0 i x 3 4 lim 1 as a flow problem 69 for every i 0 ob p the subgroup n is the image of the differential c 2 p f d c 1 p f and it is generated by x x f x where i 0 i 1 and i 1 i 2 are any two composable morphisms and x f i 0 definition 3 4 1 let p be a graded poset and let f p ab be a functor a generalized flow is an element x x hom p with finitely many terms different from zero such that i i 0 f x i 0 i x for every i 0 ob p a minimal trivial flow is a generalized flow x x f x where i 0 i 1 and i 1 i 2 are any two composable morphisms and x f i 0 with these definitions it is clear that lemma 3 4 2 lim 1 f 0 if and only if any generalized flow can be written as sum of minimal trivial flows there is also an easy geometrical interpretation of m on the directed graph as sociated to p see 1 3 2 because in the graded poset p any morphism factors as composition of morphisms of degree 1 then in the class x lim 1 f m n of a gen eralized flow x x hom p there is a representantive x x hom 1 p which takes nonzero values just in degree 1 morphisms to obtain x is enough to use the cycles x 1 x f x 2 where 2 1 is a morphism of degree greater than 1 arguing by induction on max deg x 6 0 morphisms of degree 0 do not appear as we assume that we are using normalized chain complexes 1 7 definition 3 4 3 let p be a graded poset and let f p ab be a functor a flow is an element x x hom 1 p with finitely many terms different from zero such that i i 0 deg 1 f x i 0 i deg 1 x for every i 0 ob p again we have lemma 3 4 4 lim 1 f 0 if and only if any flow can be written as sum of minimal trivial flows 70 3 higher direct limits consider the directed graph associated to p see 1 3 2 then a flow corresponds to a choice of a value x f i 0 for each edge i 0 i 1 of this graph i e for each morphism of degree 1 of p i 0 x i 1 in order for x to be a flow for each i 0 ob p we must have the equality i i 0 deg 1 f x i 0 i deg 1 x for example for a vertex i 0 as i 1 x 1 i 4 i 2 x 2 i 0 x 4 x 5 x 6 i 5 i 3 x 3 i 6 where hom 1 p i 0 1 2 3 and hom 1 i 0 p 4 5 6 this condition reads f 1 x 1 f 1 x 2 f 3 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 a minimal trivial flow can be represented as the generalized flow i 0 x x i 2 i 1 f x but notice that the arrows are not edges of the directed graph associated to p in general example 3 4 5 consider the graded poset p with shape it was considered before on example 2 1 4 a g 0 00 00 00 00 00 00 0 f c e j k b h gg i d this representation

the full subcategories of p with objects p p 0 p p 6 p 0 definition 3 4 6 let p be a graded poset write p for the full subcategory of p with objects all but those objects i 0 such that there are no arriving arrows to i 0 and such that i 0 p is empty or connected write p n pn 1 for n 1 and p 0 p we have inclusions pn pn 1 p 1 p p 0 p then define the core of p denoted core p as the inverse limit lim n pn in the complete category of small categories 72 3 higher direct limits notice that if p is finite then we obtain core p from p after a finite number of times of applications of the operator example 3 4 7 consider the graded poset p with shape a g 0 00 00 00 00 00 00 0 f c e j k b i d then p 1 p is the category a g 0 00 00 00 00 00 00 f c b i d and p 2 p core p is a g 1 11 11 11 11 11 11 f c d lemma 3 4 8 let p be a finite graded poset and let f p ab be a functor then any class x lim 1 f has a representative x x hom core p which takes nonzero values just in morphisms of the core of p proof by the definition of the core of p it is enough to prove that any gener alized flow x is in the same class that a generalized flow x x p which takes nonzero values just in morphisms of p take any generalized flow x over p and its class x lim 1 f by the above remarks we can suppose that x is in fact a flow i e takes nonzero values just in degree 1 morphisms consider any object i 0 which is in p but not in p then there are no arriving arrows to i 0 and i 0 p is empty or connected if it is empty then there is nothing to do thus assume that i 0 p is non empty and connected the equation for x on i 0 becomes 17 0 i 0 i deg 1 x 3 4 lim 1 as a flow problem 73 fix i 0 i with deg 1 now take any other arrow 6 i 0 j of degree 1 if it does not exist such a then we are done recall that i 0 p is connected then there exists a zigzag of morphisms connecting i and j because p is a graded poset we can assume that the zig zag has the following shape i j 0 g gg gg gg gg j 1 g gg gg gg gg g k 1 i 0

limits if we add up these two minimal trivial flows for all i 0 n 1 we obtain a generalized flow yj with yj 0 and such that for i 0 i yj x if x if 0 otherwise thus x x yj is a representative for x which verifies for i 0 i x x x if 0 if x otherwise notice that by construction if x 6 0 then either x 6 0 or has origin in i and i ob p doing the same construction for each arrow i 0 j different from and of degree 1 with xi 0 j 6 0 recall that there is a finite number of these arrows we obtain a representative x for x such that for i 0 i x x i 0 j deg 1 6 x if 0 otherwise then by equation 17 x 0 and x 0 for each arrow with origin in i 0 again by construction if x 6 0 then either x 6 0 either has origin in i and i ob p as it was described before the lemma there is a representative x for x x which takes non zero values just in morphisms of degree 1 moreover if x 6 0 then either x 6 0 either has origin in i and i ob p then we repeat the process but with x instead of x for any object i 0 which is in p but no in p and for which there is a morphism with origin in i 0 and with x 6 0 there is a finite number of such objects thus finally we obtain a representative for x which takes values different from zero on morphism which do not begin on objects from ob p ob p i e on morphisms from hom p because p is finite by hypothesis then core p is reached in a finite number of computations p p p core p and the lemma is proven next we present some conditions on vanishing of higher limits derived from the previous lemma corollary 3 4 9 let p be a finite graded poset with core p then every functor f p ab is lim acyclic proof that lim 1 f 0 results directly from the lemma above the limit lim i f with i 2 is given by lim 1 ki 1 where ki 1 p ab is a functor see section 3 3 corollary 3 4 10 let p be a finite graded poset such that core p is a tree if f p ab is a functor with f core p monic then f is lim acyclic 3 4 lim 1 as a flow problem 75 proof for lim 1 f notice that the class x lim 1 f of any generalized flow x has as representative a flow x living in core p then the equations for x to be a flow imply that x 0 as core p is a tree and f restricted to core p is monic the limit lim i f with i 2 is given by lim 1 ki 1 where ki 1 p ab is a monic functor see section 3 3 then use the same argument this implies in particular that cf corollary 3 3 12 corollary 3 4 11 let p be a finite tree if f p ab is a monic functor then f is lim acyclic proof if p is a tree then core p is a subcategory of p and thus it is a tree too then use the previous corollary chapter 4 higher inverse limits 4 1 injective objects in abi consider the abelian category abp for some graded poset p in this section we shall determine the injective objects in abp following dual arguments to those of chapter 3 1 recall that in ab the injective objects are well known and are exactly the direct sums of q and z p for various primes p along the rest of the section p denotes a graded poset suppose f abp is injective how does f look we show that the intersection of the kernels of the non identity morphisms with source i 0 is an injective abelian group to prove it write definition 4 1 1 ker i 0 i 0 i 6 1 i 0 kerf or ker i 0 f i 0 if the index set of the intersection is empty and coim i 0 f i 0 ker i 0 for any diagram in ab as the following ker i 0 a 0 0 w w w w w b 0 0 oo 0 oo 0 oo we want to find 0 that makes it commutative consider the atomic functors a b p ab which take the values on objects a i a 0 for i i 0 0 for i 6 i 0 b i b 0 for i i 0 0 for i 6 i 0 and on morphisms a 1 a 0 for 1 i 0 0 for 6 1 i 0 b 1 b 0 for 1 i 0 0 for 6 1 i 0 and the natural transformations b f and a b given by i j 0 for i i 0 0 for i 6 i 0 77 78 4 higher inverse limits i 0 for i i 0 0 for i 6 i 0 where j is the inclusion ker i 0 f i 0 then 0 b a is exact as 0 b 0 0 a 0 is so it is straightforward that is a natural transformation the key point in checking that is a natural transformation is that for i 0 i 1 6 1 i 0 the diagram f i 0 f f i 1 b 0 j 0 oo 0 b i 1 i 1 oo must commute and it does because f j 0 for every 6 1 i 0 so as f is injective this data gives a natural transformation which makes commutative the diagram of natural transformations f a c b ks ks 0 ks which restricts over i 0 to f i 0 ker i 0 j oo a 0 i 0 dd 0 w w w w w b 0 0 oo 0 oo 0 oo then 0 exists if and only if im i 0 ker i 0 to check that this condition holds take i 0 i 1 with 6 1 i 0 and a a 0 then f i 0 a i 1 a a i 1 0 0 we have just proven lemma 4 1 2 let f p ab be an injective functor over a graded poset p then ker i 0 is injective for every object i 0 ob p this means that we can write f i 0 ker i 0 coim i 0 with ker i 0 injective for every i 0 ob p and also that example 4 1 3 for the category p with shape 4 1 injective objects in ab i 79 the functor f p ab with values q q z p prime z p is not injective as ker on the left object equals the non injective abelian group z now that we know a little about the values that an injective functor f p ab takes on objects we can wonder about the values f for hom p do they have any special property recall that a feature of graded posets is that there is at most one arrow between any two objects and also that remark 4 1 4 if p is graded then for any i 0 ob p ker i 0 i 0 i deg 1 kerf because every morphism factors as composition of morphisms of degree 1 we prove that the following property holds for f definition 4 1 5 let f p ab be a functor over a graded poset p with degree function deg fix an integer d 0 if for any i 0 ob p different objects ij j j ob p arrows j i 0 ij with deg j d and elements xj ker ij for each j j there is y f i 0 with f j y xj for each j j we call f d pseudo injective if f is d pseudo injective for each d 0 we call f pseudo injective remark 4 1 6 in case j 1 and ker i 1 f i 1 we are claiming that the homomorphism f 1 f i 0 f i 1 is surjective notice that any functor is 0 pseudo injective as the identity is an epimorphism before proving that injective functors f over a graded poset verify this property we define two functors ker and ker and natural transformations and that fit in the diagram f ker ker ks ks 0 ks for any functor f p ab with p a graded poset we begin defining ker because for every i 1 i 0 holds that f ker i 1 ker i 0 we can factor f as in the diagram f i 1 f f i 0 ker i 1 oo f ker i 1 ker i 0 oo 80 4 higher inverse limits in fact if 6 1 i 1 then f ker i 1 0 by definition because the identity 1 i 0 cannot be factorized by non identity morphisms in a graded poset then we have a functor ker with value ker i on the object i of p and which maps the non identity morphisms to zero ker is a kind of discrete functor also it is clear that exists a natural transformation ker f with i the inclusion ker i f i now we define ker from ker in a dual way as free diagrams are constructed let ker be defined on objects by ker i 0 i 0 i ker i for hom p i 1 i 0 ker is the only homomorphism which makes commute the diagram ker i 1 ker ker i 0 ker i i 1 i oo 1 ker i i 0 i oo for each i 1 i that factors through i 0 i 1 i and the diagram ker i 1 ker ker i 0 ker i i 1 i oo 0 88 qqqqqqqqqq for each i 1 i that does not factor through then there exists a candidate to natural transformation ker ker whose value i is the inclusion of ker i into the direct summand ker i 1 i i i corresponding to the identity on i is a natural transformation if for every i 1 i 0 with i 1 6 i 0 the following diagram is commutative ker i 1 ker ker i 0 ker i 1 i 1 oo 0 ker i 0 i 0 oo it is straightforward that this square commutes because 1 i 1 i 1 i 1 cannot be factored through 4 1 injective objects in ab i 81 now we have the commutative triangle f ker 7 x x x x x x x x ker ks ks 0 ks where the natural transformation exists because f is injective to prove that f is pseudo injective take i 0 ob p different objects ij j j ob p arrows j i 0 ij with deg j d and elements xj ker ij for each j j to visualize what is going on consider the diagram above near i 0 in case j 1 2 f i 0 f 1 yytt tt tt tt t f 2 k kk kk kk kk f i 1 f i 2 ker i 0 66 mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm ker 2 k kk kk kk kk ker 1 yyss ss ss ss s ker i 0 oo i 0

ij for some j j 0 otherwise fix j 0 j and consider the map ker j 0 ker i 0 ker ij 0 because all the maps j j j have degree d then we have a commutative triangle ij 0 i 0 j 0 j ij only in case j j 0 and 1 j 0 this means that ker j 0 maps x ker i 0 to xj 0 ker ij 0 1 j 0 ij 0 ij 0 ker ij 0 thus for each j j 18 ker j x ij xj set y def i 0 x and take j j then f j y f j i 0 x i 0 ker j x i 0 ij xj i 0 xj xj and we are done this completes the proof of lemma 4 1 7 let f p ab be an injective functor over a graded poset p then f is pseudo injective 82 4 higher inverse limits example 4 1 8 for the category p with shape the functor f p ab with values z p q z where p is prime is not injective as the inclusion is not surjective in spite of the ker s are q z and 0 which are injective objects of ab now we define pre injective objects definition 4 1 9 let f p ab be a functor over a graded poset p we call f pre injective if 1 for any i 0 ob p ker i 0 is injective 2 f is pseudo injective till now we have obtained that injective functors p ab over graded posets are pre injective in fact as the next proposition shows the restriction we did to graded posets is worthwhile proposition 4 1 10 let p be a bounded above graded poset and f p ab be a functor then f is injective if and only if it is pre injective proof if f is injective then lemmas 4 1 2 and 4 1 7 prove that f is pre injective so assume that f is an pre injective functor we can suppose that the degree function deg on p is decreasing and takes values 3 2 1 0 and that ob 0 p 6 to see that f is injective in abp given a diagram of functors with exact row as shown we must find a natural transformation a f making the triangle commutative f a c b ks ks 0 ks we define inductively beginning on objects of degree 0 and successively on objects of degrees 1 2 3 so take i 0 ob 0 p of degree 0 and restrict to the diagram in ab over i 0 by definition 4 1 9 as ker i 0 f i 0 f i 0 is an injective abelian group so we can close the following triangle with a homomorphism i 0 f i 0 a i 0 i 0 w w w w w b i 0 i 0 oo i 0 oo 0 oo as there are no arrows between degree 0 objects then restricted to the full sub category with objects of degree 0 is trivially a natural transformation now suppose 4 1 injective objects in ab i 83 that we have defined on all objects of p of degree less than n n 1 and that the restriction of to the full subcategory generated by these objects is a natural transformation and verifies the next step is to define on degree n objects so take i 0 obn p and consider the splitting f i 0 ker i 0 coim i 0 where ker i 0 i 0 i 6 1 i 0 kerf to define i 0 such that it makes commutative the diagram ker i 0 coim i 0 a i 0 i 0 66 nnnnnnn b i 0 i 0 oo i 0 oo 0 oo we define by components i 0 i 0 k i 0 c with i 0 k a i 0 ker i 0 and i 0 c a i 0 coim i 0 define i 0 k as a homomorphism which closes the diagram ker i 0 f i 0 pi 0 oooo a i 0 i 0 k cc b i 0 i 0 oo i 0 oo 0 oo where pi 0 is the projection this homomorphism i 0 c does exist because ker i 0 is an injective abelian group defining i 0 c needs a little bit more of work claim 4 1 10 1 fix a a i 0 then for each l 0 n 1 there is yl f i 0 such that 19 f yl i a a for each i 0 i with deg i l notice that i in equation 19 is defined by the induction hypothesis and because deg i l n we prove claim 4 1 10 1 by induction the base case reduces to find y 0 f i 0 such that f y 0 i a a for each i 0 i with deg i 0 notice that as there are no objects of negative degree then ker i f i for each i with deg i 0 then i a a f i 84 4 higher inverse limits ker i for each i with deg i 0 and thus y 0 exists because f is n pseudo injective taking j def i i 0 i and deg i 0 now we prove the inductive step of claim 4 1 10 1 suppose we have yl 1 verifying the hypothesis of the claim for l n then we construct yl consider any object i of degree l n such that there is an arrow i 0 i we have the elements i a a and f yl 1 in the abelian group f i moreover for any i i with 6 1 i it holds that 20 f f yl 1 f yl 1 i a a by the induction hypothesis on yl 1 and because deg i deg i l also we have that 21 f i a a i a a because is a natural transformation on objects of degree less than n and because deg i l n equations 20 and 21 give that i a a f yl 1 ker i then considering j def i i 0 i and deg i l and applying that f is n l pseudo injective we obtain y f i 0 such that f y i a a f yl 1 for each i 0 i with deg i l define yl def yl 1 y to check that yl satisfies the statement of the claim take i 0 i with deg i l if deg i l then f yl f yl 1 y f yl 1 i a a f yl 1 i a a if deg i l then f yl f yl 1 y i a a f y in fact f y 0 factor as i i 0 i where i has degree l then f y f f y f i a a f yl 1 i a a f yl 1 0 by using the induction hypothesis on yl 1 and on the naturality of this finishes the proof of the claim 4 1 injective objects in ab i 85 now we define i 0 c take a a i 0 and define i 0 c a y coim i 0 where y f i 0 is such that f y i a a for each i 0 i with 6 1 i 0 the element y is obtained by taking y yl with l n 1 in claim 4 1 10 1 it is straightforward that i 0 c is well defined because if y f i 0 also verifies that f y i a a for each i 0 i with 6 1 i 0 then y y ker i 0 and thus y y in coim i 0 also it is clear that i 0 c is a homomorphism of abelian groups it remains to prove that i 0 i 0 i 0 take b b i 0 and write i 0 b pi 0 i 0 b i 0 b f i 0 we want to see that i 0 k i 0 b pi 0 i 0 b and that i 0 c i 0 b i 0 b the equation i 0 k i 0 b pi 0 i 0 b holds by definition of i 0 k moreover for each i 0 i with 6 1 i 0 we have that f i 0 b i b b as is a natural transformation and that i a i 0 b i i b b i b b as is a natural transformation and as holds on objects of degree less than n by the induction hypothesis then by the definition of i 0 c i 0 c i 0 b i 0 b defining i 0 in this way for every i 0 obn p we have now defined on all objects of p of degree less or equal than n the last thing to do in order to complete the inductive step is to prove that restricted to the full subcategory over these objects is a natural transformation take i 0 i of degree different from zero in this full subcategory if the degree of i 0 is less than n then the commutativity of f i 0 f f i a i 0 a i 0 oo a i i oo is granted by the inductive hypothesis suppose that the degree of i 0 is n take a a i 0 then i 0 a i 0 k a i 0 c a i 0 k a y where y f i 0 is such that f y i a a for each i 0 i with 6 1 i 0 then f i 0 k a 0 because i 0 k a ker i 0 thus f i 0 a f y 86 4 higher inverse limits and f y i a a by the construction of y this proposition yields the following examples the degree functions deg for the bounded above graded posets appearing in the examples are indicated by subscripts ideg i on the objects i ob p and take values 3 2 1 0 example 4 1 11 for the pullback category p with shape a 0 f b 0 g c 1 a functor f p ab is injective if and only if f c ker f f and ker f g are injective abelian groups f f and f g are epimorphisms for the

f fi d fi d 1 fi is an epimorphism for d 0 1 i 1 for each i 1 2 3 4 4 2 pseudo injectivity consider a functor f p ab over a small category p in this section we look for and find conditions on f such that lim i f 0 for i 1 i e we want conditions such that the right derived functors of the left exact functor lim vanishes on f we restrict along this section to graded posets p fix the following notation definition 4 2 1 let p be a graded poset and f p ab we say f is lim acyclic if lim i f 0 for i 1 recall that for injective objects it holds that any right derived functor vanishes so from proposition 4 1 10 we obtain firstly that proposition 4 2 2 let f p ab be a pre injective functor over a bounded above graded poset p then f is lim acyclic because being lim acyclic is clearly weaker than being injective we can wonder if is it possible to weaken the hypothesis on proposition 4 2 2 keeping the thesis of lim acyclicity the answer is yes and the following theorem states the appropriate conditions notice that we have removed the condition 1 of definition 4 1 9 4 2 pseudo injectivity 87 theorem 4 2 3 let f p ab be a pseudo injective functor over a bounded above graded poset p then f is lim acyclic proof we can suppose that the degree function deg on p is decreasing and takes values 3 2 1 0 and that ob 0 p 6 to compute lim t f we use the normalized see 2 0 6 spectral sequences corresponding to the sixth row of table 1 of chapter 2 fix t 1 to prove lim t f 0 it is enough to show that e p t p 1 is zero for every p the contributions to e p t p 1 comes from e p p p p t for p p t we are using normalized spectral sequences remark 2 0 6 we prove that ep rp p p t 0 if r is big enough for each p and p p t this implies that lim t f 0 consider the decreasing filtration l of c p f that gives rise to the spectral sequence e the n simplices are lpn l pcn p f npn deg 0 p f for each p we have an increasing filtrationm p of the quotient l p lp 1 that gives rise to the spectral sequence ep and which n simplices are mp p n npn deg 0 p deg n p f for p p t the abelian group ep rp q at the t p q p simplices is given by ep rp q mp p t d 1 mp p r t 1 mp p 1 t d 1 mp p r t 1 mp p t d mp p r 1 t 1 where d is the differential of the quotient lp lp 1 restricted to the subgroups of the filtration mp for r p p t 1 there are not t 1 simplices beginning in degree p and ending in degree less or equal to p r p t 1 i e mp p r t 1 0 also r big enough implies mp p r 1 t 1 mp p t 1 l p lp 1 t 1 i e mp p r 1 t 1 equals all the t 1 simplices that begin on degree p thus there exists r such that 22 ep rp q mp p t d 1 0 mp p 1 t d 1 0 mp p t d mp p t 1 fix such an r and take x ep rp q where 23 x mp p t npt deg 0 p deg t p f and d x 0 we prove that x 0 in two steps step 1 in this first step we find a representative x mp p t d 1 0 for x such that x 0 for every 0 1 1 2 t 1 t 1 t t with deg t 1 p 88 4 higher inverse limits notice that because p is bounded above then mp p t npt deg 0 p deg t p f npt deg 0 p 0 deg t p f we need the following claim 4 2 3 1 for each l 0 p there exists a representative x l mp p t d 1 0 for x such that x l 0 for every 0 1 1 2 t 1 t t with deg t 1 l notice that taking l p in the claim the step 1 is finished the case l 0 in the claim is fulfilled by taking x 0 x because there are no objects of negative degree now we build x l from x l 1 for 1 l p for that we need the claim 4 2 3 2 for each m 0 l there exists a representative x l m mp p t d 1 0 for x such that x l m 0 for every 0 1 1 2 t 1 t t with deg t 1 l or deg t 1 l and deg t m notice that taking m l in claim 4 2 3 2 we obtain x l def x l l such that x l 0 if deg t 1 l i e such that x l satisfies claim 4 2 3 1 define x l 0 def x l 1 this satisfies the claim for m 0 as there is no object of negative degree now we build x l m from x l m 1 for 1 m l by hypothesis d x l m 1 0 the differential d is the restriction of the induced differential on lp lp 1 to d mp p t mp p t 1 recall that d j 1 t 1 1 jdj and that for npt 1 the final object of dj is t 1 for each j 1 2 t and t for j t 1 thus for every npt 1 with deg 0 p and deg t 1 p we can apply the projection mp p t 1 f and obtain that d x l 1 0 now fix npt with deg 0 p deg t 1 l and deg t m 1 consider the object t obm 1 p and any morphism t i with 6 1 t write def 0 1 1 t 1 t t i 4 2 pseudo injectivity 89 notice that deg p and deg t 1 deg i deg t m 1 l 1 p by hypothesis d x l 1 0 in fact as x l m 1 fulfills claim 4 2 3 2 then d x l m 1 f x l m 1 and so f x l m 1 0 because t i was arbitrary we have proven that x l m 1 ker t for each npt with deg 0 p deg t 1 l and deg t m 1 consider now any npt 1 with deg 0 p and deg t 1 l for the object t 1 of degree l consider all the non trivial morphisms from t 1 to objects of degree m 1 define homp t 1 i deg i m 1 notice that for each and the t simplex def 0 1 1 t 2 t 1 t 1 i we have proven before that x l m 1 ker i then as f is m 1 l pseudo injective there is an element x f t 1 such that f x x l m 1 for every consider now the t 1 chain y mp p t 1 given by y x if deg t 1 l 0 otherwise if fact as y takes non zero values just on with deg t 1 l p then y mp p t 1 and thus d y mp p t mp is a filtration of a differential complex this means that d y mp p t d mp p t 1 define x l m x l m 1 d y then x l m mp p and d x l m 0 thus x l m x l m 1 x that x l m fulfills claim 4 2 3 2 is clear by construction this finishes the proofs of claims 4 2 3 2 and 4 2 3 1 step 2 by the step 1 we can suppose that x 0 for np t with deg 0 p and deg t 1 p our objective now is to see that there exists y mp p t 1 with d y x this implies that x 0 and finishes the proof of the theorem we need the claim 4 2 3 3 there are chains xi mp p t for i p p 1 p t 1 p t p t 1 and yi mp p t 1 for i p p 1 p t 1 p t such that 24 d yi xi xi 1 for i p p 1 p t 1 p t with xp x and xp t 1 0 moreover i xi 0 if deg t 1 i for i p p t 1 ii d xi 0 for i p p t 1 90 4 higher inverse limits notice that the claim finishes the step 2 as xp t 1 0 then xp t d yp t xp t 1 d yp t 1 xp t d yp t 1 yp t xp t 2 d yp t 2 xp t 1 d yp t 2 yp t 1 yp t x xp d yp xp 1 d yp yp 1 1 p p t yp t where yp yp 1 1 p p t yp t mp p t 1 define xp def x then conditions i and ii are satisfied for i p we construct yi and xi 1 from xi recursively beginning with i p the element yi is built as in claim 4 2 3 1 the only difference being that now yi lies in mp i t 1 mp p t 1 but not in mp p t 1 then write xi 1 def d yi xi notice that d xi 1 d 2 y d xi 0 0 0 by the induction hypothesis on i also notice that xi 1 satisfies i of the claim 4 2 3 3 by the construction of yi when constructing yp t and xp t 1 from xp t notice that because np t 1 with deg 0 p and deg t 1 p t 1 imply that every morphism in is of degree 1 then the condition dj for np t only holds for j t this implies that xp t 1 0 by the construction of yp t example 4 2 4 for the pullback category p with shape a 0 f b 0 g c 1 a functor f p ab is lim acyclic if f f and f g are epimorphisms for the inverse telescope category p with shape a 4 f 4 a 3 f 3 a 2 f 2 a 1 f 1 a 0 a functor f p ab is lim acyclic if f fi d fi d 1 fi is an epimorphism for d 0 1 i 1 for each i 1 2 3 4 4 3 computing higher limits theorem 4 2 3 shows that over a bounded above graded poset pseudo injectivity is enough for lim acyclicity but it turns out that pseudo injectivity is not necessary for lim acyclicity example 4 3 1 for the pushout category p with shape a 0 f g b 1 c 1 a functor f p ab is pseudo injective if and only if f a f f f g f b f c is an epimorphism but a straightforward calculus shows that lim i f 0 for i 1 for any f 4 3 computing higher limits 91 anyway we shall see how pseudo injectivity allows us to obtain a better knowledge of the higher limits lim i f we begin with definition 4 3 2 let f p ab be a functor over a graded poset p then f p ab is the functor which takes values on objects f i 0 i 0 i f i for i 0 ob p for hom p i 1 i 0 f is the only homomorphism which makes the diagram f i 1 f f i 0 f i i 1 i oo 1 f i i 0 i oo to commute for each i 1 i that factors through i 0 i 1 i and the diagram f i 1 f f i 0 f i i 1 i oo 0 99 ttttttttt for each i 1 i that does not factor through notice that f is built from f as ker was built from ker in section 4 1 and that kerf i f i for each i ob p a nice property of f is lemma 4 3 3 let f p ab be a functor over a graded poset then for each g abp there is a bijection homabp g f i ob p homab g i f i the proof is analogous to that of lemma 3 3 3 another interesting property of f is the following lemma 4 3 4 let f p ab be a functor over a graded poset then lim f i ob p f i proof it is straightforward using the previous lemma the main feature of f we shall use is 92 4 higher inverse limits lemma 4 3 5 let f p ab be a functor over a graded poset then f is pseudo injective proof it is straightforward remark 4 3 6 the monic natural transformation f g where g q zu f with u ab set the forgetful functor and q z set ab the power on a set is a way to prove that abc has enough injectives for any small category c see 13 243 ff on how to construct the maps f i g i for i ob c by lemma 4 3 3 there is a unique natural transformation f f correspond ing to the family of homomorphisms f i 1 f i f i i ob p it is clear that is a monic natural transformation thus we can consider the object wise co kernel of to obtain a short exact sequence of functors 0 f f cf 0 if p is bounded above then the long exact sequence see section 1 6 associated to this short exact sequence gives lim j f lim j 1 cf j 1 coim lim f lim cf j 1 because f is lim acyclic it is pseudo injective by lemma 4 3 5 and apply theorem 4 2 3 arguing as in the direct limit case we have lemma 4 3 7 let p be a bounded above graded poset and let f p ab be a functor then there are functors cj p ab for j 0 1 2 with c 0 f and c 1 coim f f such that lim j f lim j 1 c 1 lim j 2 c 2 lim 1 cj 1 coim lim c j 1 lim cj for each j 0 1 2 the values f i 0 and cf i 0 can be very big this can be improved considering the functor ker p ab of section 4 1 suppose that p is bounded above and choose a family of homomorphisms f i ker i such that the choice for the objects i 0 which do not have any departing arrow is the identity f i 0 f i 0 ker i 0 then the natural transformation f ker given by lemma 4 3 3 is monic in case f is monic we have lemma 4 3 8 let p be a bounded above graded poset and let f p ab be a monic functor then there is a short exact sequence of functors 0 f ker c 0 where ker is lim acyclic chapter 5 cohomology in this chapter we develop further the tools of chapter 4 in order to compute the integer cohomology of graded posets p under some structural assumptions i e the existence of a covering family throughout this chapter p shall be a bounded above graded poset with decreasing degree function deg which takes the values 3 2 1 0 and with ob 0 p 6 conditions 1 3 10 are assumed for p in the whole chapter the first two sections are devoted to the computation of higher limits lim i f where f p ab takes free groups as values after this we specialize in compute h i p z lim i cz whereas cz p ab is the constant functor of value z finally we apply it to simplex like posets the key concepts defined in sections 5 1 and 5 2 i e p condensed functors free functors covering families and adequate covering families are all of local nature in the sense that they depend on i 0 p and on f i 0 p for all i 0 ob p 5 1 p condensed functors recall that any family of homomorphisms f i ker i i ob p gives a functor f ker f by lemma 4 3 3 if is monic then we have a short exact sequence of natural transformations 0 3 f 3 ker f 3 g 3 0 where ker f is lim acyclic this implies that lim 1 f coim lim ker f lim g and lim i f lim i 1 g for i 2 notice that lim ker f is known by lemma 4 3 4 next we find conditions on f such that we can build a monic natural transforma tion definition 5 1 1 let f p ab be a functor suppose p has decreasing degree function deg ob p 3 2 1 0 and let 0 p z we say that f is p condensed if a f i 0 if deg i p and b kerf i 0 if deg i p notice that constant functors are 0 condensed if the functor f is p condensed then we can consider the natural transformation f ker f given by lemma 4 3 3 for the maps i f i kerf i i 1 f i if deg i p 0 otherwise 93 94 5 cohomology notice that we have kerf i f i if deg i p 0 otherwise by hypothesis a and b in definition 5 1 1 in fact the functor ker f takes values on objects 25 ker f i 0 i i 0 p p f i where i 0 p p i ob p i 0 i deg i p and kerf for i 0 i 1 is induced by the projections determined by i 1 p p i 0 p p the homomorphism i f i ker f i is given by i i i 0 p p f i where i i 0 i is the unique arrow from i 0 to i i 0 p p so i is a kind of diagonal an easy induction argument on deg i p p 1 shows that is a monic natural transformation we have obtained lemma 5 1 2 let f p ab be a p condensed functor then there is a short exact sequence 0 3 f 3 ker f 3 g 3 0 g is obtained by taking the object wise co image of on the object i 0 g takes the value 26 g i 0 i i 0 p p f i i 0 f i 0 it is clear that g verifies condition a of definition 5 1 1 for p 1 but in general condition b does not hold for g and p 1 more precisely if deg i 0 p 1 then kerg i 0 0 is equivalent to the natural map f i 0 lim i 0 p f being an isomorphism where i 0 p is the full subcategory of p with objects i i 0 i i 6 i 0 this natural map is a monomorphism by condition b of f being p condensed so kerg i 0 0 if and only if f i 0 lim i 0 p f is surjective this is a local property we summarize these results in the following lemma 5 1 3 let f p ab be a p condensed functor then there is a short exact sequence 0 3 f 3 ker f 3 g 3 0 moreover g is p 1 condensed if and only if for each object i 0 of degree greater than p 1 we have f i 0 lim i 0 p f 5 2 covering families 95 5 2 covering families in this section we study a bit further the condition given in lemma 5 1 3 which implies that the g is p 1 condensed where the functor g is defined by the short exact sequence 0 3 f 3 ker f 3 g 3 0 and f is a p condensed functor this condition states that g is p 1 condensed if and only if for each object i 0 of degree greater than p 1 it holds that the map 27 f i 0 lim i 0 p f is an isomorphism recall that this map is a monomorphism if f is p condensed fix i 0 of degree greater than p 1 and consider the map given by restriction lim i 0 p f hom i 0 p cz f i j f i over the subset j i 0 p p if this restriction map turns out to be injective notice that it is injective for j i 0 p p because f is p condensed then the composition f i 0 lim i 0 p f i j f i is also injective if f is a free functor definition 1 2 3 then both groups f i 0 and i j f i are free abelian groups because we are assuming remark 1 3 10 if the map f i 0 i j f i is pure then by lemma 1 2 2 the condition rkf i 0 i j rkf i implies that this composition is an isomorphism and so f i 0 lim i 0 p f thus we study the subsets j ob p that make this restriction map a pure monomorphism definition 5 2 1 let p be a bounded above graded poset with decreasing degree function deg which takes values 3 2 1 0 a family of subsets j j i 0 p i 0 ob p 0 p deg i 0 with j i 0 p i 0 p p is a covering family if a for each i 0 and 0 p deg i 0 it holds that i j i 0 p 1 i p p i 0 p p b for each i 0 0 p deg i 0 and i j i 0 p 1 it holds that j i p j i 0 p notice that the definition above does not depend on a functor defined over the category p also we have j i 0 deg i 0 i 0 by a the next definition states the relation we expect between a covering family and a p condensed free functor definition 5 2 2 let p be a bounded above graded poset j be a covering family and f p ab be a p condensed free functor we say that f is j determined if 96 5 cohomology for any object i 0 of degree greater than p 1 the restriction map lim i 0 p f i j i 0 p f i is a monomorphism and the map f i 0 i j i 0 p f i is pure if deg i 0 p 1 then we require that the last map above is a pure monomor phism the main feature of covering families is that allow freeness plus j determinacy to pass from f to g for an object i 0 with deg i 0 p 1 notice that the map f i 0 i j i 0 p f i is a pure monomorphism as consequence of definition 5 2 2 the condition in defi nition 5 2 2 for deg i 0 p 1 is added in order to obtain that g is a free functor notice that the following proposition restricts to functors which take free abelian groups as values proposition 5 2 3 let p be a bounded above graded poset and j a covering family assume that f p ab is p condensed free and j determined and consider the functor g defined by 0 3 f 3 ker f 3 g 3 0 then if for each object i 0 with deg i 0 p 1 it holds that rkf i 0 i j i 0 p rkf i then g is p 1 condensed free and j determined proof notice that the hypothesis implies that for any object i 0 of degree deg i 0 p 1 the two maps f i 0 lim i 0 p f i j i 0 p f i are isomorphisms in particular f i 0 lim i 0 p f and so g is p 1 condensed if deg i 0 p 1 then the map f i 0 i j i 0 p f i is an isomorphism by hypothesis next we prove that g is a free functor consider any i ob p with deg i p 1 if deg i p 1 then g i 0 and the short exact sequence of abelian groups 0 f i i ker f i i g i 0 5 2 covering families 97 then it is straightforward that the map si ker f i j i p p f j j jip f j f i is a section of i i e si i 1 f i use that the restriction map f i j jip f j is injective this implies that the short exact sequence above splits and so g i is a subgroup of the free abelian group ker f i and thus it is free as well next we prove that g is j determined take i 0 of degree n deg i 0 greater than p 2 we first check that the restriction map lim i 0 p g i j i 0 p 1 g i is injective consider any element lim i 0 p g which is in the kernel of the restriction map above notice that as deg i 0 p 2 we can consider the subset j i 0 p 2 i 0 p if for any j j i 0 p 2 it holds that j 1 0 then 0 by definition 5 2 1 a and because g is p 1 condensed thus take j j i 0 p 2 we want to see that x def j 1 0 recall the short exact sequence of abelian groups 0 f j j ker f j j g j 0 and take y ker f j such that j y x recall that ker f j i j p p f i and denote by i j i the unique arrow from j to i for i j p p now consider the restriction y i j j p f i because deg j p 2 p 1 the map f j i j j p f i is an isomorphism by hypothesis then there exists a unique z f j with f i z yi for each i j j p j p p if we prove that f i z yi for each i j p p then j z y this implies that x j y j j z 0 and finishes the proof thus take i j p p by definition 5 2 1 a there is i i i with i j j p 1 write i j i for the unique arrow from j to i it holds that i i i by definition 5 2 1 b we have that j j p 1 j i 0 p 1 thus g i x g i j 1 i 1 0 as is in the kernel of the restriction map the short exact sequence 0 f i i ker f i i g i 0 implies that there exists ti f i such that i ti ker f i y consider zi f i z we have that zi and ti have the same image by the restriction map lim pi f i ji p f i because j i p j j p because f is j determined then this restriction map is a monomor phism and so zi ti this implies that f i z f i i z f i zi f i ti yi 98 5 cohomology and the proof of the restriction map being injective is finished now we check that the map g i 0 i j i 0 p 1 g i is pure take z i j i 0 p 1 g i such that there exists x g i 0 with n z x for some n 6 0 we have to check that there exists x g i 0 with z x or equivalently that x n x for some x g i 0 recall once more the short exact sequence of abelian groups 0 f i 0 i 0 ker f i 0 i 0 g i 0 0 and take y ker f i 0 with i 0 y x we are going to build h f i 0 such that y i 0 h n y i e such that for any i i 0 p p the element y i 0 h i yi f i 0 i h f i is divisible by n this implies that x n x with x i 0 y notice that by hypothesis for each j j i 0 p 1 g i 0 j x n zj g j this implies that there exist hj f j and yj ker f j such that ker f i 0 j y j hj n yj i e such that for each i j p p i 0 p p we have that yi f j i hj n yj i f i it is enough to take yj with j yj zj to build h we use the map i j i 0 p f i f i 0 given by hypothesis which is the inverse of the map f i 0 i j i 0 p f i for each i j i 0 p i 0 p p choose by definition 5 2 1 a j i j i 0 p 1 such that there is an arrow j i i then set i f j i i hj i f i where hj i is built as before define h def by construction f i 0 i h f j i i hj i for each i j i 0 p but not for an arbitrary i i 0 p p with this definition for h we check now that yi f i 0 i h is divisible by n for each i i 0 p p this finishes the proof fix i i 0 p p and ji j i 0 p 1 such that there is an arrow ji i we are not assuming that ji j i if i j i 0 p on the one hand we have by hypothesis that yk f ji k hji n yji k for each k pjip in particular 28 yk f ji k hji n yji k for each k j jip set h def f i 0 ji h because ji j i 0 p 1 then by definition 5 2 1 b j jip j i 0 p and thus by construction for any k j ji p yk f i 0 k h yk f j k k hj k n yj k k 5 2 covering families 99 notice that f i 0 k h f ji k f i 0 ji h f ji k h on the other hand we have obtained 29 yk f ji k h n yj k k for each k j jip now write k yj k k yji k for each k j ji p and write h f ji where is the inverse of the map f ji i j ji p f i by equations 28 and 29 it is straightforward that the elements hji n h and h have the same image by this map then as this map is injective by hypothesis h hji n h then recall that i j jip yi f i 0 i h yi f ji i h yi f ji i hji n h and this equals n yji i n f ji i h thus yi f i 0 i h is divisible by n if deg i 0 p 2 we have to see that the map g i 0 i j i 0 p 1 g i is a pure monomorphism to prove that is a monomorphism use the proof above starting where j is considered for an arbitrary object j of degree p 2 the proof of being pure is exactly the same as above remark 5 2 4 notice that in the conditions of the proposition and assuming that f takes finitely generated free abelian groups as values we have the following formula for the rank of the free abelian group g i 0 for deg i 0 p 1 rk g i 0 i i 0 p p rkf i rkf i 0 recall that we are assuming 1 3 10 this is so because of the short exact sequence of free abelian groups 0 f i 0 i 0 ker f i 0 i 0 g i 0 0 remark 5 2 5 consider again the map si 0 ker f i 0 f i 0 with si 0 i 0 1 f i 0 built in the proof of the previous proposition for deg i 0 p 1 to si 0 corresponds the monomorphism g i 0 i 0 ker f i 0 given by i 0 x x i 0 si 0 x 100 5 cohomology which satisfies i 0 i 0 1 g i 0 it is straightforward that by construction im i 0 i i 0 p p j i 0 p f i and thus g i 0 i 0 i i 0 p p j i 0 p f i moreover x i 0 y is the only preimage of y by i 0 which verifies xi 0 for i j i 0 p the main consequence of the previous proposition is that it reduces the problem of whether g is p 1 condensed to some integral equations moreover this procedure can be applied recursively because the resulting functor g turns out to be p 1 condensed free and j determined and so the proposition applies to g too notice that the ranks of g are given by remark 5 2 4 5 2 1 adequate covering families in this section we apply the work devel oped in sections 5 1 and 5 2 to compute the cohomology with integer coefficients of the realization of a bounded above graded poset p equipped with a covering family j to compute the abelian group hp p z for p 1 we compute the higher limit lim pcz where cz p ab is the functor of constant value z which sends every morphism to the identity 1 z we begin studying the extra conditions that the covering family j must satisfy to apply iteratively the proposition 5 2 3 beginning on cz first notice that cz is 0 condensed we are assuming 1 3 10 and free definition 1 2 3 by definition 5 2 2 cz is j determined as 0 condensed functor if and only if for each i 0 ob p with deg i 0 2 the set j i 0 0 intersects each connected component of i 0 p the dimensional equation in proposition 5 2 3 for i 0 ob p with deg i 0 1 becomes rk cz i 0 1 j i 0 0 i j i 0 0 rk cz i thus cz is j determined as 0 condensed functor if and only if i 0 p is connected for deg i 0 2 and j i 00 1 for deg i 0 1 the successive applications of proposition 5 2 3 give by the dimensional equation in the statement of the proposition 5 2 3 the following structural conditions linking p and j definition 5 2 6 let p be a bounded above graded poset define inductively on p the number ri 0 p for each object i 0 with deg i 0 p by r i 0 0 1 and by ri 0 p i i 0 p p 1 rip 1 r i 0 p 1 for p 1 definition 5 2 7 let p be a bounded above graded poset and j be a covering family for p we say that j is adequate if i 0 p is connected for deg i 0 2 and if we have the equality ri 0 p i j i 0 p rip 5 2 covering families 101 for p 0 and deg i 0 p 1 proposition 5 2 8 let p be a bounded above graded poset and let j be an adequate covering family then there is a sequence of functors f 0 f 1 f 2 defined by f 0 def cz p ab and by the short exact sequence 0 3 fp 1 p 1 3 ker fp 1 p 3 fp 3 0 for p 1 2 3 moreover fp is p condensed free and j determined for p 0 for deg i 0 p we have rkfp i 0 r i 0 p proof we prove by induction the following claim 5 2 8 1 for p 0 1 2 n there exist functors f 0 f 1 f 2 fn given by f 0 def cz p ab and by a short exact sequence 0 3 fp 1 p 1 3 ker fp 1 p 3 fp 3 0 for p 1 2 3 n moreover for any p 0 1 2 n fp is p condensed free and j determined and for deg i 0 p we have rkfp i 0 r i 0 p the base case of the claim n 0 holds by the arguments before the proposition and because rkf 0 i 0 rk cz i 0 1 r i 0 0 for any i 0 ob p suppose that the claim holds for n 0 then we prove it for n 1 we apply proposition 5 2 3 to the n condensed free and j determined functor fn given by the induction hypothesis thus we have to check that for every object i 0 of degree greater or equal to n 1 the following equality holds rkfn i 0 i j i 0 n rkfn i by the induction hypothesis this equations is exactly ri 0 n j j i 0 n rin and this holds by the definition of adequate covering family by remark 5 2 4 the rank of fn 1 i 0 for deg i 0 n 1 is given by rkfn 1 i 0 i i 0 p n rkfn i rkfn i 0 which by the induction hypothesis again equals rkfn 1 i 0 i i 0 p n rin r i 0 n thus rkfn 1 i 0 r i 0 n 1 by definition 5 2 6 102 5 cohomology 5 2 2 local basis and morphisms in the previous section we found a se quence of functors f 0 cz f 1 f 2 to compute the cohomology of a graded poset p equipped with an adequate covering family j moreover we found the dimension of fp i for any i p in this section we shall build inductively an explicit basis for fp i for p 0 and i 0 ob p we choose the basis b i 0 0 1 of f 0 i 0 z for p 1 1 and deg i 0 p 1 notice that we have an isomorphism cf 5 2 5 fp 1 i 0 i 0 i i 0 p p j i 0 p fp i which sends y fp 1 i 0 to the only element x ker fp i 0 which projects on y by i 0 and with xi 0 for each i j i 0 p this proves the following lemma 5 2 9 let p be a bounded above graded poset and let j be an adequate covering family let cz f 1 f 2 be the sequence of functors given by proposition 5 2 8 then there are basis bip of fp i for p 0 and deg i p such that for p 0 and deg i 0 p 1 the map i 0 of the short exact sequence 0 fp i 0 i 0 i i 0 p p fp i i 0 fp 1 i 0 0 maps i i 0 p p j i 0 p bip bijectively onto b i 0 p 1 remark 5 2 10 notice that for y i 0 x fp 1 i 0 the expression of y in terms of the basis of the lemma above y i i 0 p p j i 0 p l 1 rip yli i 0 e i p l where bip e i p 1 e i p rip corresponds to the expression of i 0 y x i 0 si 0 x i i 0 p p j i 0 p fp i i 0 y i i 0 p p j i 0 p l 1 rip yli e i p l in terms of the basis i i 0 p p j i 0 p bip next we are interested in the expression of fp with respect to the basis of lemma 5 2 9 fix the map i 1 i 2 with deg i 1 deg i 2 p 1 the basis b i 1 p is in 1 1 correspondence with the set i i 1 p p j i 1 p bip 1 and the basis bi 2 p is in 1 1 correspondence with the set i i 2 p p j i 2 p bip 1 5 3 global behaviour 103 take an element i 1 e i p 1 l of b i 1 p where i i 1 p p j i 1 p and l 1 r i p 1 then fp i 1 e i p 1 l i 2 ker fp 1 eip 1 l we have ker fp 1 e i p 1 l eip 1 l if i i 2 p p 1 0 otherwise and thus fp e i p 1 l i 2 e i p 1 l if i i 2 p p 1 0 otherwise suppose that i i 2 p p 1 if i j i 2 p 1 then i 2 e i p 1 l is an element of b i 2 p and so fp sends the element i 1 e i p 1 l to the element i 2 e i p 1 l if i j i 2 p 1 then we have to find the coefficients of i 2 e i p 1 l with respect to the basis b i 2 p by the remark 5 2 10 these coefficients equal the coefficients of i 2 i 2 e i p 1 l with respect to the basis i i 2 p p 1 j i 2 p 1 bip 1 of i i 2 p p 1 j i 2 p 1 fp 1 i this proves the following lemma 5 2 11 let p be a bounded above graded poset and j an adequate covering family let i 1 i 2 with deg i 1 deg i 2 p 1 be a map in p then fp is the identity when restricted to i i 1 p p 1 j i 1 p 1 i 2 p p 1 j i 2 p 1 bip 1 remark 5 2 12 notice that if i 2 j i 1 p then definition 5 2 1 implies that j i 2 p 1 j i 1 p 1 then for i i 1 p p 1 j i 1 p 1 if i i 2 p p 1 then i j i 2 p 1 thus in this case i 1 p p 1 j i 1 p 1 i 2 p p 1 j i 2 p 1 i 2 p p 1 j i 2 p 1 and the lemma applies to the whole fp i 2 fp i 1 5 3 global behaviour in the previous section we saw proposition 5 2 8 how the local properties of a graded poset p equipped with an adequate covering family j give rise to a sequence f 0 cz f 1 f 2 of functors in this section we study some global properties of j as well as we define global covering families the first global point to notice is that the sequence of functors from proposition 5 2 8 does not depend on the adequate covering family j thus two o more adequate covering families can be considered for the the same graded poset and they still give rise to the same sequence of functors next we focus on the short exact sequence 0 3 fp 1 p 1 3 ker fp 1 p 3 fp 3 0 104 5 cohomology for p 1 of proposition 5 2 8 the beginning of the long exact sequence of this short exact sequence is 30 0 lim fp 1 p 1 lim ker fp 1 p lim fp hp p z 0 by lemma 4 3 5 where p 1 p 1 and p p notice that the three inverse limits appearing above are free abelian groups as the corresponding functors take free abelian groups as values in fact for the middle term we have the exact description 31 lim ker fp 1 i obp 1 p fp 1 i given by lemma 4 3 4 it turns out that also there is a simpler description for lim fp which can be interpreted as the analogue to the fact that the cohomology on degree n depends upon the n 1 skeleton recall that fp i 0 if deg i p lemma 5 3 1 let p be a bounded above graded poset and let j be an adequate covering family let cz f 1 f 2 be the sequence of functors given by proposition 5 2 8 then lim fp lim fp p p 1 p for each p 0 proof consider the restriction map lim fp lim fp p p 1 p this map is clearly a monomorphism because fp is a p condensed functor to see that it is surjective take lim fp p p 1 p we want to extend to each i ob p with deg i p 1 we do it inductively on deg i notice that see the beginning of the proof of proposition 5 2 3 fp i lim i p fp is an isomorphism for deg i p 1 for deg i p 2 we have that j i p implies that deg j p 1 then there is a unique way of extending to i once we have extended to p p 2 p 1 p we proceed with an induction argument that the extension that we are building is actually a functor is again due to that fp is p condensed also from equations 30 and 31 we have the following formula analogue to that of the euler characteristic for cw complexes lemma 5 3 2 let p be a bounded graded poset for which exists an adequate covering family then i 1 i rkh i p z i 1 i p obi p rip 5 3 global behaviour 105 5 3 1 global covering families recall that covering families were defined as subsets of the local categories i p for i ob p where p is a bounded above graded poset in this section we define global covering families by subsets of the whole category p imitating some of the local features of the local covering families definition 5 3 3 let p be a bounded above graded poset for which there exists an adequate covering family and consider the sequence of functors f 0 cz f 1 f 2 given by proposition 5 2 8 a global covering family is a family of subsets k kp p 0 with kp obp p such that for p 1 the restriction map lim fp i kp fp i is a monomorphism and the map i obp 1 p kp 1 fp 1 i i kp fp i is pure for p 0 we require that the first map above is a pure monomorphism notice that the definition does not depend on the particular adequate covering family used to obtain the sequence of functors as the sequence of functors does not depend on it the map i obp 1 p kp 1 fp 1 i i kp f i used in the definition is obtained from 30 as i obp 1 p kp 1 fp 1 i i obp 1 p fp 1 i ker fp 1 p lim fp i kp fp i for the rest of the section suppose we have a graded poset p with adequate covering family j and global covering family k consider the free condensed and j determined functors cz f 1 f 2 given by proposition 5 2 8 for each p 1 we have at the local level a short exact sequence 0 fp 1 i 0 i 0 i i 0 p p fp 1 i i 0 fp i 0 0 for deg i 0 p and at the global level we have the short exact sequence 0 lim fp 1 p 1 lim ker fp 1 p lim fp hp p z 0 recall that it was a set of integral equations involving j the adequateness prop erty that gave rise to the local short exact sequences above next we study if the condition hp p z 0 can also be stated in terms of integral equations involving k we begin defining adequate global covering families 106 5 cohomology definition 5 3 4 let p be a bounded above graded poset for which exists an ade quate covering family and let k be a global covering family we say that k is adequate if i obp 1 p rip 1 i kp 1 rip 1 i kp rip for p 1 the numbers rip depend on the local shape of p and were defined in definition 5 2 6 consider the diagram 0 lim fp 1 p 1 lim ker fp 1 p lim fp hp p z 0 i kp 1 fp 1 i i kp fp i recall that the six abelian groups involved in the diagram are free abelian groups but possibly hp p z suppose first that hp p z 0 for a fixed p 1 then as lim ker fp 1 i obp 1 p fp 1 i and rkfp 1 i r i p 1 proposition 5 2 8 we have the equality rk lim fp 1 i obp 1 p rip 1 rk lim fp 0 by definition of adequate covering family we also have the equation i kp 1 rip 1 i obp 1 p rip 1 i kp rip 0 from these two equations it is clear that i kp 1 rip 1 rk lim fp 1 i kp rip rk lim fp thus in case hp p z 0 for p 1 we obtain that the condition 32 i kp rip rk lim fp holds for each p 0 if and only if it holds for some p 1 now we work in the opposite way does equation 32 for each p 1 imply that hp p z 0 for each p 1 recall that by the definition of global covering family the map lim f 0 i k 0 f 0 i is a pure monomorphism then equation 32 for p 0 implies that this map is in fact an isomorphism suppose now inductively that the map lim fp 1 i kp 1 fp 1 i 5 3 global behaviour 107 is an isomorphism and that equation 32 holds for p because k is a global covering family the map lim fp i kp fp i is a monomorphism this implies that the quotient map lim ker fp 1 lim fp 1 i kp fp i is injective too by the induction hypothesis lim fp 1 i kp 1 fp 1 i and thus lim ker fp 1 lim fp 1 i obp 1 p kp 1 fp 1 i as k is a global covering family the map i obp 1 p kp 1 fp 1 i i kp f i is pure with rk lim ker fp 1 lim fp 1 i kp rip rk i kp f i k is adequate this implies that it is an isomorphism that lim ker fp 1 lim fp 1 i kp fp i is an isomorphism too that lim ker fp 1 i kp fp i and lim ker fp 1 lim fp are epimorphisms and that lim fp i kp fp i is an isomorphism moreover hp p z 0 we have proven theorem 5 3 5 let p be a bounded above graded poset for which there exists an adequate covering family and an adequate global covering family k suppose there exists p 0 1 such that rk lim fp 0 i kp 0 rip 0 then hp p z 0 for p 1 rk lim fp i kp rip for p 0 108 5 cohomology the beauty of this theorem is that it states the fact of p being acyclic in terms of integral equations at first glance it seems that the numbers rk lim fp are totally unknown however recall that rk lim f 0 rk lim cz is the number of connected components of p see also lemma 5 3 1 and if p is bounded below with p 0 z minimal such that obp 0 p 6 it turns out from the definition of global covering family that kp 0 obp 0 p and rk lim fp 0 i obp 0 p rip 0 i kp 0 rip 0 thus as ri 0 1 for each i ob p we obtain theorem 5 3 6 let p be a bounded graded poset for which there exist an adequate covering family and an adequate global covering family k then p is acyclic if and only if k 0 equals the number of connected components of p moreover in this case h 0 p z z k 0 5 4 simplex like posets recall section 1 4 that simplicial complexes can be viewed as a special kind of posets simplex like posets another examples of simplex like posets are subdivision categories see 28 and the category sdc used by libman in 27 for the normalizer decomposition for p local finite groups in this section we shall see that if p is a simplex like poset then it is a graded poset and pop is a bounded above graded poset that can be equipped with an adequate covering family we begin showing that p and pop are graded lemma 5 4 1 let p be a simplex like poset then p and pop are graded posets p is bounded below and pop is bounded above proof that p and pop are posets is immediate to see that p is graded recall that by definition of simplex like poset for any p ob p the subcategory p p is isomorphic to the poset of all non empty subsets of a finite set t with inclusion as order relation define deg p t 1 then deg ob p z is a decreasing degree function which assigns 0 to minimal elements and p is graded the same function deg is an increasing degree function for pop which assigns 0 to maximal elements to see that p and pop are bounded just apply the definition it is straightforward that the poset p is simplex like p if and only if for each p ob p the subcategory p pop p p op is isomorphic for some n 0 to the poset deg p defined below definition 5 4 2 for any integer n 0 define the poset n as the subdivision category of the poset 0 1 2 n i e it has as objects the sequences of integers n 0 n 1 nk which are increasing n 0 n 1 nk and with 0 nj n the arrows are generated by the morphisms dl n 0 n 1 nk n 0 n 1 n l nk for l 0 k it is a bounded above and below graded poset with degree function deg n 0 n 1 nk k 5 4 simplex like posets 109 example 5 4 3 2 looks like 0 1 d dd dd dd d 0 0 1 2 vvvvvvvvv h hh hh hh hh 0 2 zzzzzzzz d dd dd dd d 1 1 2 zzzzzzzz 2 next we shall see that there is an adequate covering family for n this is a first step to equip the whole pop with an adequate covering family lemma 5 4 4 there is an adequate covering family j j ip i ob n 0 p deg i for n moreover for p 0 and deg i q p we have rip p l 0 1 p l q 1 l proof for the object i 0 0 1 2 n ob n of degree n define the subsets j i 0 p i 0 n p for 0 p n as the sequences of increasing integers n 0 n 1 np 1 np which biggest value is n i e such that np n this definition coincides with the following inductive one j i 00 n and j i 0 p s n s i 0 n p 1 j i 0 p 1 for p 1 2 n for any other object i ob n different from i 0 0 1 2 n of degree deg i m n we define the subsets j ip i n p for 0 p m using the definition above for m instead of n and taking into account the natural isomorphism m n i see the remark below purely combinatorial arguments show that j is a covering family for n example 5 4 5 for n 2 have j 0 1 2 0 2 j 0 1 2 1 0 2 1 2 j 0 1 2 2 0 1 2 0 1 e ee ee ee e 0 0 1 2 uuuuuuuuu i ii ii ii ii 0 2 zzzzzzzzz e ee ee ee e 1 1 2 zzzzzzzzz 2 also j 0 1 0 1 j 0 2 0 2 and j 1 2 0 2 110 5 cohomology remark 5 4 6 for this covering family we have the following statement which is stronger than definition 5 2 1 b j iq j i 0 q i n q for each i 0 0 p deg i 0 i j i 0 p and 0 q deg i moreover we have that rip 1 if deg i p by using the binomial expansion of 1 1 p 1 0 remark 5 4 7 notice that any isomorphism of categories m c is deter mined by the values a for 0 a m a m 0 if c n i the natural isomorphism m n i used in the lemma above is the only order preserving isomorphism i e the only one such that a b if and only if a b now we reach the main result of this section lemma 5 4 8 if p is a simplex like poset then there is an adequate covering family for the bounded above graded poset pop proof above we have defined isomorphisms of categories p pop n for each p ob p and we know that n can be equipped with an adequate covering family to build an adequate covering family k ki 0 p i 0 ob pop 0 p deg i 0 we have just to choose appropriately the isomorphisms p pop n consider the degree function deg ob pop z defined in lemma 5 4 1 and the set t of the maximal elements of pop i e t p ob pop deg p 0 choose a total order for t suppose t is finite or use the axiom of choice 24 then given p ob pop consider the subset p pop 0 t and the restriction p p op 0 of the total order from t there is a unique isomorphism p p p op deg p which induces an order preserving map p pop 0 deg p 0 0 1 2 deg p denote by j the covering family for deg p of lemma 5 4 4 and define for 0 n deg p kpn 1 p j p n then k fulfills condition a of definition 5 2 1 because for 0 n deg p p pop n 1 p deg p n 1 p i j p p n 1 i deg p n 1 p i 1 p k p n 1 1 p i deg p n i k p n 1 i pop n to check condition b of definition 5 2 1 take i k p n 1 for some 0 n deg p and call j to the covering family for n 1 of lemma 5 4 4 we want to see that kin k p n recalling the natural inclusion i p op p pop this is equivalent to 1 i j i i n 1 p j p p n 5 4 simplex like posets 111 and to j i i n j p p n where p 1 i by construction is order preserving see remark 5 4 7 and thus this inclusion holds next we list more familiar re statements of results about covering families applied to simplex like posets lemma 5 4 9 let p be a simplex like poset and consider the bounded above graded poset pop for which exists an adequate covering family by lemma 5 4 8 let k be a global covering family for pop then k is adequate if and only if obp 1 p kp 1 kp for p 1 proof apply remark 5 4 6 to definition 5 2 7 lemma 5 4 10 let p a simplex like poset then i 1 i rkh i p z i 1 i obi p proof use remark 5 4 6 and observe that p pop and that ob p ob pop then apply lemma 5 3 2 chapter 6 application webb s conjecture denote by sp g the brown s complex of the finite group g for the prime p whose elements are the non trivial p subgroups of g and that was introduced by brown 11 webb conjectured that the orbit space sp g g as topological space is contractible this conjecture was first proven by symonds in 40 generalized for blocks by barker 4 5 and extended to arbitrary saturated fusion system by linckelmann 28 the works of symonds and linckelmann prove the contractibility of the orbit space by showing that it is simply connected and acyclic and invoking whitehead s theorem both proofs of acyclicity work on the subposet of normal chains introduced by knorr and robinson 25 for groups symonds uses the results from the venaz and webb 41 that the subposet of normal chains is g equivalent to brown s complex linckelmann proves on his own that also for fusion systems the orbit space and the orbit space on the normal chains has the same cohomology 28 theorem 4 7 in this chapter we shall apply the results of chapter 5 to prove in an alternative way that the orbit space on the normal chains is acyclic let s f be a saturated fusion system where s is a p group consider its sub division category s f see 28 2 and the poset s f an object in s f is an f isomorphism class of chains q 0 q 1 qn where the qi s are subgroups of s the subcategory s f q 0 qn has objects qi 0 qim with 0 m n and 0 i 1 i 2 im n see 28 2 again for example s f q 0 q 1 q 2 is q 0 j jj jj jj jj j q 0 q 1 qq qqq qqq qqq q q 1 99 tttttttttt j jj jj jj jj j q 0 q 2 q 0 q 1 q 2 q 2 99 tttttttttt q 1 q 2 66 mmmmmmmmmmmm then it is clear that s f is a simplex like poset following linckelmann s notation denote by s f the full subcategory of s f which objects q 0 qn with qi qn for i 0 n also denote by s f the subdivision category of s f which is a sub poset of s f our goal in this chapter is to prove that hn s f z 0 for n 1 and h 0 s f z z it is straightforward that s f is a simplex like poset and 113 114 6 application webb s conjecture thus by lemma 5 4 8 there exists an adequate covering family for the bounded above graded poset s f op we shall build an adequate global covering family for s f op in order to apply theorem 5 3 6 the definition of the global covering family is as follows and it is related with the pairing defined by linckelmann in 28 definition 4 7 the notion of paired chains was used by knorr and robinson in several forms throughout 25 definition 6 0 11 for the graded poset s f op define the subsets k kn n 0 by kn q 0 qn q 0 qn q 0 q n n i 0 ns q i q n lemma 6 0 12 the family k kn n 0 defined in 6 0 11 is a global covering family for s f op the proof is postponed to the next section the argument uses the properties of the local covering family of the simplex like category s f op and that the chains q 0 qn can be ordered by qn the fact that k is defined through a pairing provides see next section a bijection obn s f op kn kn 1 which gives lemma 6 0 13 the global covering family k kn n 0 defined in 6 0 11 is ade quate for s f op proof for any n 0 we have obn s f op kn obn s f op kn then the bijection lemma 6 1 2 obn s f op kn kn 1 gives obn s f op kn kn 1 as wished see lemma 5 4 9 as s f is connected then so is s f op thus rk lim cz 1 over s f op also by elementary properties of p groups it is clear that k 0 s i e the only subgroup of s which equals its normalizer in s is s itself and k 0 1 then theorem 5 3 6 gives theorem 6 0 14 let s f be a saturated fusion system then hn s f op z 0 for n 1 and h 0 s f op z z 6 1 k is an adequate global covering family in this section we prove that the family k kn n 0 defined in 6 0 11 is an adequate global covering family for s f op we use terminology and results from 10 appendix for any chain q 0 qn in s f define the following subgroup of automor phisms of qn aq 0 qn aut qn qi qi i 0 n 6 1 k is an adequate global covering family 115 then n aq 0 qn s qn n i 0 ns qi if q 0 qn q 0 q n then there is isof qn q n with q i qi for i 0 n and aq 0 qn 1 aq 0 q n by 10 a 2 a qn is fully aq 0 qn normalized if and only if n aq 0 qn s qn is maximum among n a q 0 q n s qn with q 0 q n q 0 qn i e if and only if ni 0 ns qi is maximum among n i 0 ns q i with q 0 q n q 0 qn notice that in the isomorphism class of chains q 0 qn always there is a representantive q 0 q n which is fully aq 0 q n normalized and that any two representantives q 0 q n and q 0 q n of q 0 qn which are fully aq 0 q n normalized and fully aq 0 q n normalized respectively verify ni 0 ns q i n i 0 ns q i thus definition 6 0 11 is equivalent to definition 6 1 1 for the graded poset s f op define the subsets k kn n 0 by kn q 0 q n q n fully aq 0 q n normalized and n i 0 ns q i q n lemma 6 1 2 for any n 0 there is a bijection obn s f op kn kn 1 proof take q 0 qn obn s f op kn and a representantive q 0 q n which is fully aq 0 q n normalized then n i 0 ns q i q n define q 0 qn q 0 q n n i 0 ns q i the proof is divided in four steps a is well defined take another representantive q 0 q n which is fully aq 0 q n normalized then by 10 a 2 c there is a morphism homf n a q 0 q n s q n n a q 0 q n s q n with q i q i for i 0 n as n i 0 ns q i n i 0 ns q i then is an isomorphism onto n a q 0 q n s q n and thus q 0 q n n i 0 ns q i q 0 q n n i 0 ns q i b q 0 qn belongs to kn 1 we have q 0 qn q 0 q n n i 0 ns q i where q 0 q n is fully aq 0 q n normalized take any representantive q 0 q n q n 1 in q 0 q n n i 0 ns q i if it were the case that q n 1 n 1 i 0 ns q i then we would have ni 0 ns q i q n 1 n 1 i 0 ns q i n i 0 ns q i which is in contradiction with q 0 q n being fully aq 0 q n normalized 116 6 application webb s conjecture c is injective suppose we have q 0 qn and r 0 rn with q 0 q n n i 0 ns q i r 0 r n n i 0 ns r i then r 0 rn r 0 r n q 0 q n q 0 qn d is surjective take q 0 qn qn 1 in kn 1 we check that q 0 qn q 0 qn qn 1 take a representantive q 0 q n in q 0 qn which is fully aq 0 q n normalized then q 0 qn obn s f op kn and q 0 qn q 0 q n n i 0 ns q i then by 10 a 2 c there is homf n aq 0 qn s qn n a q 0 q n s qn with qi q i for i 0 n as qn 1 i n 1 i 0 ns qi then qn 1 n i 0 ns qi and qn 1 n i 0 ns q i if it were the case that qn 1 n i 0 ns q i then we would have qn 1 n n i 0 ns q i qn 1 n 1 i 0 ns qi n 1 i 0 ns qi qn 1 a contradiction thus qn 1 n i 0 ns q i and the proof is finished lemma 6 1 3 the family k kn n 0 defined in 6 0 11 is a global covering family for s f op proof for n 0 we have to prove that the map lim cz i k 0 f 0 i i s f 0 i z is a pure monomorphism in fact as s f is connected this map is an isomorphism for n 1 we have to prove that lim fn i kn fn i is a monomorphism and the map i obn 1 p kn 1 fn 1 i i kn fn i is pure we begin proving the injectivity take lim fp such that i 0 for each i kn if there is no object of degree greater than n i e ob n 2 n 1 s f op then kn obn s f op and we are done if not we prove that j 0 for each j of degree n 1 by induction on qn 1 this is enough to see that is zero as fn is n condensed we shall use the local covering family j defined in 5 4 for the simplex like category s f op the case base is j q 0 qn 1 with qn 1 maximal this implies that j jn kn then j goes to zero by the monomorphism fn j i j j n fn i 6 1 k is an adequate global covering family 117 and thus j 0 for the induction step consider j q 0 qn 1 and j q 0 q l qn 1 j j n with 0 l n then either j kn and j 0 or j kn and there is an arrow in s f op j q 0 q l q n 1 m i 0 i 6 lns q i j q 0 q l qn 1 in the latter case j 0 by the induction hypothesis and thus j 0 too as before as the map fn j i j j n fn i is a monomorphism j 0 now we prove that the map i obn 1 p kn 1 fn 1 i i kn fn i is pure take y i kn fn i n 1 and x i obn 1 p kn 1 fn 1 i with n y x we want to find x with n x x we prove that xi is divisible by n for each i q 0 qn 1 obn 1 p kn 1 by induction on qn 1 the case base is i q 0 qn 1 with qn 1 maximal consider the arrow in s f op j q 0 q n 1 n 1 i 0 ns q i q 0 qn 1 as qn 1 is maximal then j j n 1 kn 1 then n yj x j is the image of xi 0 0 by the map ker fn 1 j l j s f n 1 fn 1 i j fn j as fn j l j s f n 1 j j n 1 fn 1 l fn 1 i by remark 5 2 5 then n divides xi for the induction step consider i q 0 qn 1 obn 1 p kn 1 and j q 0 q n 1 i n 1 i 0 ns q i as before n yj x j is the image of x x j s f n 1 by the map ker fn 1 j l j s f n 1 fn 1 i j fn j by remark 5 2 5 again n yj j x j sj x j xi j sj x j j n 0 0 now by the induction hypothesis for each l j jn either l kn 1 and xl 0 either l kn 1 and thus by the induction hypothesis n divides xl then n divides x j j n and so by the equation above and the isomorphism fn j fn 1 i n divides xi too chapter 7 application homotopy colimit in this section we deal with the problem of when the natural map from the homo topy colimit of a diagram of nerves of groups to the nerve of the colimit of the groups is an isomorphism by hocolim and hocolim we denote the unpointed and pointed homotopy colimits in the sense of bousfield kan respectively for any discrete group g 0 grp we denote by bg 0 sset the nerve of the category with one object and with automorphism group g 0 which is a classifying space for g 0 and by ig 0 z g 0 the augmentation ideal of g 0 p always denote a small category in this section more precisely for a functor g p grp with takes as values discrete groups and a cone g g 0 we have and induced cone b bg bg 0 which gives a map hocolimbg bg 0 we are interested in finding conditions such that this map induces a weak homotopy equivalence 33 hocolimbg bg 0 in case g 0 lim g we have the following preliminary result which proof is left to section 7 1 theorem 7 0 4 let g p grp be a functor and g g 0 be a cone and call f the homotopy fiber f hocolimbg bg 0 assume p is contractible and the cone g g 0 is monic then 1 1 f ker lim g g 0 2 0 f coker lim g g 0 3 hj f lim j 1 h for each j 2 where h p ab is a monic functor thus if g 0 lim g then f is simply connected some examples follow example 7 0 5 consider a monic functor g p grp where p is the telescope category p with shape a 0 f 1 a 1 f 2 a 2 f 3 a 3 f 4 a 4 119 120 7 application homotopy colimit then p is contractible and the cone g g 0 l 0 g al is monic then by part theorem 7 0 4 and example 3 3 13 hocolimbg bg 0 example 7 0 6 consider a functor g p grp where p is the pushout category p with shape a f g b c then p is contractible and if g f and g g are injective then the cone g lim g is monic 37 then by theorem 7 0 4 and example 3 3 13 we have hocolimbg bg 0 thus we obtain the classical result of whitehead that states that hocolimbg b g b g a g c if both g f and g g are monomorphisms remark 7 0 7 assume g f is a monomorphism then 8 bg f is a cofibration the diagram bg b bg a bg c is a cofibrant object for some structure of closed model category on ssetp and so hocolimbg lim bg this has the following consequence claim 7 0 7 1 if g f and g g are monomorphisms then hocolimbg b lim g b g a g c lim bg recall that the n simplices in lim bg are given by lim bg n lim set bgn this is a finite set if the groupsg b andg c are but the n simplices inb lim g b g a g c are in general infinite as lim g b g a g c is in general infi nite thus the geometric realization of lim bg gives a dimension wise finite cw complex as classifying space for the possibly infinite group g b g a g c example 7 0 8 consider a monic functor g p grp where p is a graded poset which is a tree then p is contractible and the cone g lim g is monic 37 then by theorem 7 0 4 and corollary 3 4 11 we have hocolimbg b lim g 7 application homotopy colimit 121 example 7 0 9 recall that a filtered category is a category p such that any two objects i j ob p can be joined i k j and such that any two parallel arrows u v i j can be co equalized by w j k with wu wv any functor f p ab with p filtered is lim acyclic as lim abp ab is exact see 42 2 6 15 a finite poset which is filtered has a terminal object and so direct limits become trivial the notion of pseudo injectivity gives an alternative condition to being filtered that also implies lim acyclicity but that does not impose the existence of a terminal object when p is a finite poset consider a contractible filtered category p and a monic functor g p grp then the limiting cone g lim g is monic use that the forgetful functor grp set creates filtered colimits 29 p 208 lim j h 0 for j 1 because lim abp ab is exact see 42 2 6 15 thus by the theorem 7 0 4 we have that hocolimbg b lim g example 7 0 10 the last example applies to any locally finite group g 0 call p to the poset category of its finite subgroups and g p grp to the monic functor which takes as values the finite subgroups of g 0 and inclusion among them then g 0 lim p g and p is filtered and contractible the trivial group is an initial object thus hocolim g g 0 g finite bg bg 0 example 7 0 11 consider a group g 0 and the poset p with the inclusion as re lation of its normal finite p subgroups for a fixed prime p if h and k are normal finite p subgroups of g 0 then hk is a p normal subgroup of g 0 too this implies that p is directed moreover p is contractible as 1 p let g p grp the monic functor which takes each subgroup of p to itself and inclusions to inclusions then by example 7 0 9 hocolim g g 0 g normal finite p subgroup bg b lim g if g is finite then lim g op g 122 7 application homotopy colimit example 7 0 12 consider a finite group g 0 and the poset p with the inclusion as relation of the normal subgroups of g 0 which have p quotient for a fixed prime p then op g 0 is an initial object of p and thus p is contractible moreover g 0 itself is a terminal object of p and thus p is filtered let g p grp the monic functor which takes each subgroup of p to itself and inclusions to inclusions then lim g g 0 and by example 7 0 9 hocolim g g 0 g normal subgroup with p quotient bg bg 0 7 1 proof of the theorem theorem 7 1 1 let g p grp be a functor and g g 0 be a cone and call f the homotopy fiber f hocolimbg bg 0 assume p is contractible and the cone g g 0 is monic then 1 1 f ker lim g g 0 2 0 f coker lim g g 0 3 hj f lim j 1 h for each j 2 where h p ab is a monic functor proof notice that because the spaces bgi are connected and we have a pointed diagram bg p ssets we can apply the van kampen s spectral sequence 39 to obtain that 1 hocolim bg lim 1 bg lim g and 0 hocolim bg 0 the fibration p hocolimbg hocolim bg gives as 1 p 0 p 0 1 hocolimbg lim g and 0 hocolimbg 0 then the fibration f hocolimbg bg 0 gives 1 f ker limg g 0 and 0 f coker limg g 0 it is readily checked that the usual construction of the homotopy fiber ff of a map f a b is functorial on a and b so the maps b i bgi bg 0 give a diagram f p sset which take values the fibers fi of b i fi bgi bg 0 by 12 the fiber f is the homotopy colimit of the diagram of the fibers f p sset f hocolim f consider the homology type first quadrant spectral sequence bousfield kan that converges to h f h hocolimfi and such that e 2 p q lim p hq f this spectral sequence describes the homology of the fiber f consider again the diagram f it can be pointed taking 1 c 1 fi for each i ob p then we have natural transformations of functors from p to sset f bg bg 0 7 1 proof of the theorem 123 for each i ob p the pointed fibration fi bgi bg 0 gives the homotopy long exact sequence 0 1 fi 1 bgi 1 bg 0 0 fi 0 bgi 0 bg 0 as the spaces gi and lim g are discrete we obtain that j fi 0 for every j 2 moreover because bgi and bg 0 are connected we have 0 1 fi gi i lim g pi 0 fi 0 this is a exact sequence with three groups and a set we can identify 1 fi 1 fi 1 c 1 with ker i and write 34 0 ker i gi i lim g pi 0 fi 0 if i 0 fi denotes the connected component of 1 c 1 fi then the exactness at lim g states that p 1 i i im i because the long homotopy exact sequence is natural 0 ker i gi i lim g pi 0 fi 0 0 ker j gj j lim g pj 0 fj 0 then we have in fact a exact sequence of functors 0 ker g lim g p 0 f 0 if the cone g lim g is monic then we have a short exact sequence of functors 0 g lim g p 0 f 0 and the spaces f are discrete the bousfield kan homology spectral sequence reduces to hp f lim p h 0 f for p 0 applying the functor free abelian group z to the short exact sequence above we obtain a sequence z g z lim g z p z 0 f 0 and taking kernels we have a short exact sequence of functors 0 h z lim g h 0 f 0 in abp whereh i ker z lim g h 0 fi which is a subgroup of the free abelian group z lim g and so it is free abelian too notice that the functor h p ab is monic the arrow h i 1 i 2 is the inclusion of the subgroup h i 1 into the subgroup h i 2 also it is clear that the functor h 0 f is epic it is deduced from the short 124 7 application homotopy colimit exact sequence above where the middle functor z lim g is constant and takes the value 1 z lim g on morphisms the long exact sequence of derived limits lim i for the short exact sequence above gives lim 1 h lim 1 z lim g lim 1 h 0 f lim 0 h lim 0 z lim g lim 0 ho f 0 and recalling the definition of homology of a simplicial set lim 1 h h 1 p z lim g lim 1 h 0 f lim 0 h h 0 p z lim g lim 0 h 0 f 0 assume p is contractible the we obtain hp f lim p 1 h for p 2 by using the long exact sequence above for convenience we give an explicit description of the functor h p ab consider again the short exact sequence with two groups and one set for any i ob p 0 gi i lim g pi 0 fi 0 there is an action of lim g 1 b lim g on 0 fi such that pi is lim g equivariant when lim g is given the left action on itself i e such that pi g g g pi g for any g g lim g moreover this action is natural in the sense that for any arrow i j in p we have 0 i j g g 0 i j for each g lim g and 0 fi as bgi is path connected the action of lim g on 0 fi is transitive fix for each 0 fi an element g lim g such that g i and g i 1 where i 0 fi is the connected component of 1 c 1 notice that pi g recall that the exactness of the short exact sequence above means that p 1 i i gi lim g then p 1 i g gi and lim g 0 fi g gi where the union is disjoint in fact 0 fi can be identified with the set of cosets gi g 1 p 73 but we do not do it here from this it is straightforward that h i 0 fi g igi 7 2 another example 125 where igi is the augmentation ideal of gi which is a free abelian group with basis g 1 16 g gi then the set bi g g g 1 6 g gi 0 fi is a basis for the the free abelian group h i 7 2 another example a libman proposed the following example as one in which hocolimbg b lim g does not hold in spite the category p is contractible and the cone is monic consider the product category of the pushout category c a b with itself and denote it by p then consider for any fixed group g 0 the functor g p grp which takes value the trivial group 1 on a a and value g 0 on the rest we compute the fiber f f hocolimbg b lim g bg 0 by means of the tools developed in earlier sections example 7 2 1 consider the contractible category p and the functor g p grp defined above by theorem 7 0 4 the fiber f f hocolimbg bg 0 is simply connected and hj f lim j 1 h for j 2 where h p ab is a monic functor by dimensional reasons lim j h 0 for j 3 the graded poset p has shape a b f ff ff ff f
