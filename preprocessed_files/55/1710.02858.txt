an isometry theorem for generalized persistence modules killian meehan david meyer abstract in recent work generalized persistence modules have proved useful in distinguishing noise from the legitimate topological features of a data set algebraically generalized persistence modules can be viewed as representations for the poset algebra the interplay between various metrics on persistence modules has been of wide interest most notably the isometry theorem of bauer and lesnick for one dimensional persistence modules the interleaving metric of bubenik de silva and scott endows the collection of representations of a poset with values in any category with the structure of a metric space this metric makes sense for any poset and has the advantage that post composition by any functor is a contraction in this paper we prove an isometry theorem using this interleaving metric on a full subcategory of generalized persistence modules for a large class of posets 1 introduction 1 1 persistent homology informally a generalized persistence module is a representation of a poset p with values in a category d that is if d is a category a generalized persistence module m with values in d assigns an object m x of d for each x p and a morphism m x y in mord m x m y for each x y p with x y satisfying m x z m y z m x y whenever x y z p with x y z perhaps surprisingly the study of such objects is useful in topological data analysis persistent homology uses generalized persistence modules to attempt to discern the topological properties of a finite data set we briefly summarize the algorithm applied to a point cloud of data in the per sistent homology setting this will lead to one dimensional generalized persistence modules where the poset p 0 or r this part of the discussion corresponds to f and then h f in our schematic below for a more extensive introduction see zc 05 elz 02 or oud 15 the typical workflow for persistent homology is as follows data persistence modules with values in simp persistence modules with values in k mod topological space of invariants f h j in the above simp denotes the category of abstract simplicial complexes suppose for example we wish to decide whether a data setd r 2 should be more correctly interpreted as an annulus or a disk in order to decide between the two candidates one calculates the homology of a filtration of simplicial complexes associated to the data set this uses the vietoris rips complex c 0 specifically for each 0 we let c be the abstract simplicial complex whose k simplices are determined by data points x 1 x 2 xk 1 d where d xi xj for all 1 i j k 1 clearly for in 0 there is an inclusion of simplicial complexes c c thus we obtain a filtration of simplicial complexes indexed by 0 therefore the assignment f c is a 1 ar x iv 1 71 0 02 85 8 v 1 m at h a t 8 o ct 2 01 7 representation of the poset 0 in fact a p space taking values in simp that is to say f is a generalized persistence module for p 0 and d simp since we wish to distinguish between an annulus and a disk we apply the first homology functor h 1 k to f where k is some field to obtain the representation of p with values in k mod h 1 c k thus the assigment h 1 k f given by h 1 c k is a one dimensional persistence module as increases generators for h 1 are born and die as cycles appear and become bound aries in persistent homology one takes the viewpoint that true topological features of the data set can be distinguished from noise by looking for generators of homology which persist for a long period of time informally one keeps an indecomposable summands of h 1 k f when it corresponds to a wide interval conversely cycles which disappear quickly after their appearance narrow ones are interpreted as noise and disregarded this technique has been widely successful in topological data analysis see for example car 09 cseh 07 cdo 12 sg 07 cidsz 08 ccr 13 hnh 16 and gpci 15 typically the cate gory of persistence modules with values in k mod is given a metric like structure so called soft stability theorems which involve the continuity of the composition h f in the schematic have been proven philosophically these results have established the utility of this method from the perspective of data analysis see for example cseh 07 hard stability theorems on the other hand concern the continuity of j in our schematic 1 2 algebraic stability one special type of hard stability theorem is an algebraic stability theorem in such a theorem one endows a collection of generalized persistence modules with two metric structures and an automorphism j is shown to be a contraction or an isometry this situation can be fit into our previous workflow diagram by choosing the topological space of invariants to be the collection of generalized persistence modules itself endowed with the alternate metric structure of particular interest is the case when j is the identity function and the metrics are an interleaving metric and a bottleneck metric algebraic stability theorems of this type are common see les 11 bl 16 bl 13 and cz 09 while in the literature the word interleaving is frequently used to describe slightly different metrics we believe that the interleaving metric suggested by bubenik de silva and scott see bds 13 has the advantage of being both most general and categorical in nature this interleaving metric makes sense on any poset p and reduces to the interleaving metric of bl 13 when p 0 alternatively a bottleneck metric is nothing more than a way of extending a metric defined on a set to the collection of all z 0 valued functions with finite support on in this context this is applied to the decomposition of a generalized persistence module into its indecomposable summands with their corresponding multiplicities 1 3 connections to finite dimensional algebras this paper concerns algebraic stability stud ied using techniques from the representation theory of algebras such representations appear because one dimensional persistence modules arising from data always admit the structure of a representation of a finite totally ordered set this fact comes from the simple observation that the one dimensional persistence module given by f c is necessarily a step function more precisely let pn 1 2 n 0 c 6 lim c by definition f is constant on all intervals of the form i i 1 thus clearly both f and h 1 k f admit the structure of a generalized persistence module for p pn when we restrict the structure of a one dimensional persistence module to pn we say informally that we are discretizing in this sense generalized persistence modules for finite totally ordered sets are the discrete analogue of one dimensional persistence modules at this point the authors wish to point out two issues arising when one discretizes first a finite data set d gives rise to not only a generalized persistence module but also to its algebra thus a priori two persistence 2 modules may not be able to be compared simply because they are not modules for the same algebra second information about the width of the interval i i 1 in relevant to the analysis but seems to be lost both of these issues are not addressed in this paper though they are dealt with successfully in mm 17 while one dimensional persistence modules will always discretize to a generalized persistence module for a finite totally ordered set representations of many other infinite families of finite posets also have a physical interpretation in the literature see bl 16 cz 09 eh 14 for exam ple multi dimensional persistence modules see cz 09 will discretize in an analagous fashion to representations of a different family of finite posets this is relevant because there is a cate gorical equivalence between the generalized persistence modules for a finite poset p with val ues in k mod and the module category of the finite dimensional k algebra a p the poset or incidence algebra of p the module theory representation theory of such algebras has been widely studied see for example acmt 05 bac 72 cib 89 fei 76 kle 75 bdlps 11 lou 75 naz 81 yuz 81 ik 17 and many others thus by passing to the jump discontinuities of a fil tration of simplical complexes one may apply techniques from the representation theory of finite dimensional algebras this perspective however suggests the need for caution while it is well known that the set of isomorphism classes of indecomposable modules for the algebra a pn is finite this situation is far from typical in fact for a generic finite poset p the representation theory of the algebra a p is undecidable in the sense of first order logic in the above generic means for all but those on a known list in particular for all p not on the list the algebra a p has infinitely many isomorphism classes of indecomposable modules indeed this is the case for the algebras associated to many of the posets which arise when one discretizes in a situation pertinent to topological data analysis this typically happens for multi dimensional persistence modules see cz 09 for example because of this studying arbitrary generalized persistence modules in complete generality is hopeless indeed if a possibly infinite poset discretizes to a finite poset p and the module cate gory for a p is undecidable the same holds for generalized persistence modules for the original poset moreover our intuition from persistent homology tells us that indecomposable modules should come with a notion of widths which can be measured in order to decide whether they should be kept or interpreted as noise in order to reconcile these two issues we pass from the full category of all a p modules to a more manageable full subcategory where we can make sense of what it means for indecomposable modules to be wide this suggests the following template for a representation theoretic algebraic stability theorem let p be a finite poset of some prescribed type and let k be a field choose a full subcategory c a p mod and let d and db be two metrics on c where i d is the interleaving distance of bds 13 restricted to c and ii db is a bottleneck metric on c which incorporates some algebraic information prove that c d id c db is an isometry in addition the class of posets covered should contain all the posets pn n n in addition the category c should reduce to the full module category when p pn when this is the case the theorem should be a discrete version of the classical isometry theorem bl 13 if possible elements of c should have a nice physical description 3 1 4 main results our algebraic stability theorem is stated below theorem 1 let p be an n vee and let c be the full subcategory of a p modules consisting of direct sums of convex modules let a b n n be a weight and let d denote interleaving distance corresponding to the weight a b restricted to c let w m min hom m m 0 t p h h and let db be the bottleneck distance on c corresponding to the interleaving distance and w then the identity is an isometry from c d id c db of course much of the language in the theorem has not yet been defined the collection of n vees generalizes pm in the sense that a 1 vee is exactly a finite totally ordered set such a theorem is very much in the flavor of classical algebraic stability theorems see bl 16 les 11 bds 13 it is common for example for the bottleneck metric restricted to indecomposables to be the interleaving metric when p is a 1 vee and the choice of weight is 1 1 theorem 1 is a discrete analogue of the standard isometry theorem of bauer and lesnick bl 13 though with a different notion of width and with the interleaving metric of bds 13 indeed both theorems 2 and 1 can be viewed as extensions of the discrete analogue to the classical isometry theorem bl 13 in the statement theorem 1 w corresponds to our choice for the width function we take our inspiration for w from bl 16 and les 11 but do not use the thickness of the support of a module m in a direction instead our width is defined in terms of algebraic conditions although the two agree in the case of one dimensional persistence modules our choice of the category c is natural both from the perspective of persistent homology and from that of representation theory once some parameters are fixed the collection of interleavings between two elements of c has the structure of an affine variety see proposition 37 and examples 11 10 and 12 the interleaving distance between two generalized persistence modules is the smallest value of a parameter for which the corresponding variety of interleavings in non empty see remark 4 and example 12 while certainly motivated by stability theorems in topological data analysis the authors take the viewpoint that such a theorem need not make explicit reference to a data set this paper will be organized as follows in section 3 we give a brief survey of the relevant background information in section 4 we define the class of posets in which we will work and in section 5 we investigate the action of the collection of translations on the set of homomorphisms between convex modules then in sections 6 we concentrate on 1 vees that is totally ordered finite sets in section 6 in particular we owe much to bauer and lesnick bl 13 then in section 7 we prove our main results after the proof of the main results we include some examples 2 acknowledgements the authors wish to acknowledge calin chindris both for introducing us to this field of study and for all of his guidance k meehan was supported by the nsa under grant h 98230 15 1 0022 3 preliminaries 3 1 generalized persistence modules recall that if p is a poset and d is a category a general ized persistence module m with values in d assigns an object m x of d for each x p and a morphism m x y in mord m x m y for each x y p with x y satisfying m x z m y z m x y whenever x y z p and x y z let dp denote the collection of generalized persistence modules for p with values in d if f g dp a morphism fromf tog is a collection of morphisms x with x mord f x g x for all x p such that for all x y we have a commutative diagram below for each x y in p 4 f x f y g x g y f x y x g x y y with these morphisms dp is a category equivalently one could regard the poset p as a thin category then a generalized persistence module will correspond to a covariant functor from p to d and morphisms in dp will be natural transformations when p is 0 or r we say that the elements of dp are one dimesional persistence modules in this paper d will always be simp or k mod 3 2 representation theory of algebras in this subsection we give a brief summary ofk algebras and their representations modules for a more expansive introduction see ars 97 ben 98 a ben 98 b throughout let k denote a field if r is a k algebra by an r module we mean a finite dimensional unital left r module the category r mod consists of r modules together with r module homomorphisms recall that an r module m is indecomposable if it is not isomorphic to a direct sum of two of its proper submodules the category r mod is an abelian krull schmidt category that is ev ery module can be written as a direct sum of indecomposable modules in a unique way up to order and isomorphism moreover the decomposition of modules is compatible with respect to homomorphisms in the following sense proposition 1 let r be a k algebra and let m n be r modules say m mi and n nj then as vector spaces hom m n i j hom mi nj this says that any module homomorphism can be f m n can be factored into a matrix of module homorphisms f ij mi nj 3 2 1 bound quivers and their representations definition 2 a quiver q q 0 q 1 t h is an ordered tuple where q 0 q 1 are disjoint sets and t h q 1 q 0 we call elements of q 0 vertices and elements of q 1 arrows the functions t and h denote the tail start and head end of the arrows thus clearly q is exactly a directed set we will always suppose the sets q 0 q 1 are finite example 1 below are two quivers 1 2 3 4 5 a b c d a 1 2 3 4 a c b d e f g b 5 quiver a corresponds toq 0 1 2 3 4 5 q 1 a b c d for an appropriate choice of the func tions h t similarly quiver b corresponds to the sets q 0 1 2 3 4 and q 1 a b c d e f g definition 3 a path is a sequence of arrows p a 1 an where t ai h ai 1 the length of the path is the number of terms in the sequence p in addition at each vertex i there is a lazy path ei of length 0 at the vertex i we extend the functions h t to paths by defining t p t an and h p h a 1 in addition t ei h ei i an oriented cycle is a path p of length greater than or equal to one with t p h p consider quiver b in example 1 then g and cabcd are oriented cycles while ggf is a path which is not an oriented cycle quiver a has no oriented cycles definition 4 a representation v of a quiver q is a family v v i i q 0 v a a q 1 where v i is a k vector space for every i q 0 and v a v t a v h a is a k linear map for every a q 1 for a fixed quiver q and field k the collection of all representations of q is a category with morphisms given below definition 5 let q be a quiver and let v w be representations of q a morphism from v to w v w is a collection of linear maps i i q 0 with i v i w i such that the diagam below commutes for all a q 1 v t a v h a w t a w h a v a t a v a h a we denote by rep q the category of k representations of the quiver q when v w is a morphsim from v to w and i is invertible for all i then we say is an isomorphism if this is the case we say that v and w are isomorphic definition 6 if v is a representation of a quiver q we say the support of v is the set of all vertices i q 0 such that v i is not the zero vector space more generally the dimension vector of v is the non negative integer vector dimk v i view ing the dimension vector of v as a function from q 0 to the non negative integers the support of v is exactly the support of this function definition 7 let q be a quiver the path algebra kq is the k vector space with basis consisting of all paths including those of length zero we define multiplication in kq as the k linear extension of concatenation of paths that is if p q are paths then p q pq if pq is a path and zero otherwise if t p a h p b we define pea p ebp by extending k linearly we obtain a ring structure on kq it is easy to see that kq is finite dimensional if and only if q has no oriented cycles the two sided ideal j inkq generated by the arrows is the radical of the ringkq for n n let jn denote the nth power of the radical j when q has no oriented cycles j is a nilpotent ideal we say an ideal i is admissible if jn i j 2 for some n the elements of i are called relations if q is a quiver and i is an admissible ideal we say q i is a bound quiver definition 8 let q i be a bound quiver then rep q i denotes the collection of all represen tations v in rep q satisfying all the relations in i then rep q i with morphisms in rep q forms a category 6 proposition 9 let q i be a bound quiver then there exists a natural equivalence between rep q and kq mod that restricts to rep q i and kq i gabriel proved that when k is algebraically closed any finite dimensional k algebra is morita equivalent to an algebra of the form kq i thus up to equivalence the study of the module category of k algebras when k is algebraically closed is the study of representations of bound quivers 3 2 2 poset algebras we will now define the algebra whose module theory is equivalent to gen eralized persistence modules with values in k mod this will be a p the poset algebra or incidence algebra of the poset p definition 10 let p be a finite poset let qp be the quiver with q 0 p there is an a q 1 with t a x h a y if i x y and ii there is no t p with x t y the quiver qp is called the hasse quiver of the poset p the hasse quiver of p is exactly the lattice of the poset with arrows corresponding to minimal proper relations example 2 the quivers below are the hasse quivers for three finite posets a c d b 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 c d e quiver a in example 1 is also the hasse quiver of a poset note that if qp is the hasse quiver for p and there is an arrow going from one vertex to another it is necessarily unique because no ambiguity is possible we may draw the hasse quiver of a poset with arrows unlabeled a finite quiver q is the hasse quiver of a poset if and only if has no oriented cycles and for all arrows p if q is a path of length greater than or equal to one with t p t q and h p h q then p q note that x y in p if and only if there is a path q in the hasse quiver with t q x and h q y definition 11 let kqp denote the hasse quiver of the poset p then the parallel ideal ip is the two sided ideal inkqp generated by all the relations equating any two paths p q inqp satisfying t q t p and h q h p for example the poset in example 2 e has parallel ideal generated by the element ca db the hasse quiver for c and d have trivial parallel ideals 7 definition 12 the poset algebra a p is the bound quiver algebra a p kqp ip by the equivalence in proposition 9 we now see that the generalized persistence modules for a finite set p with values in k mod are the same as the modules for the poset algebra a p this is because rep qp ip corresponds exactly to the definition of generalized persistence modules for d k mod where the commutativity of the triangle below corresponds to the statment that m satisfies all relations in ip m x m z m y m x z m x y m y z thus from this point forward we pass freely between generalized persistence modules and modules for the corresponding poset algebra 3 2 3 representation type for this subsubsection only let k be algebraically closed informally an arbitrary k algebra a is said to be of wild representation type if it s module category con tains a copy of the module category of all finite dimensional k algebras rather surprisingly this happens frequently example 3 poset d in example 2 is a poset whose algebra is of wild representation type when a is of wild representation type the classification of its modules up to isomorphism is hopeless in contrast the module category for a may be of finite type or of tame type finite representation type means that there are a finite number of isomorphism classes of indecompos able modules like a pn informally if a has tame representation type there are infinitely many isomorphism classes of indecomposable a modules though they are parametrized reasonably it has been shown that every algebra is either finite tame or wild in particular complete lists of poset algebras of finite representation type are known see lou 75 ds the posets that arise when one discretizes generalized persistence modules for p rn are typically wild 3 3 interleaving metrics on p and p we begin with the construction of the interleaving metric of bubenik de silva and scott see bds 13 definition 13 let p we a finite poset and t p be the collection of endomorphisms of the poset p with the additional property that p p for all p p we call the elements of t p translations explicitly a function p p is an element of t p if and only if x y x y and p p for all p p it is easy to see that the set t p is itself a poset under the relation if for all p p p p moreover t p is totally ordered if and only if p is totally ordered and t p is a monoid under functional composition let d be any metric on a finite poset p we define a height function h h d on t p definition 14 for t p set h sup d x x x p of course since p is finite we may replace supremum with maximum proceeding as in bds 13 let d be any category then t p acts on dp on the right by the formulae f p f p and f p q f p q for t p f dp similarly t p acts on morphisms in dp by acting inside the argument 8 definition 15 let f g dp and let be translations on p a interleaving between f and g is a pair of morphisms in dp f g g f such that the following diagrams commute f f f g g g the two horizontal maps in the diagram above are given by the formulae for all p p f p p and g p p respectively note that two persistence modules are 1 1 interleaved where 1 is identity translation if and only if they are isomorphic definition 16 bds 13 given any metric d on p we define d d d by the formula d m n inf interleaving with supp pd p p supp pd p p inf interleaving with h h from bubenik de silva and scott bds 13 we know that d is a lawvere metric on dp and for any category f and functor r d f post composition by r is a contraction from dp to fp with hard stability theorems in mind the fact that post composition by any functor induces a contraction is particularly noteworthy still independent of the choice of metric d on p without modification the resulting lawvere metric d d d need not be a proper metric simply because the collection of translations is not be rich enough to provide interleavings between arbitrary generalized persistence modules this is unfortunate since t p is defined naturally for any poset p the failure comes from the fact that finite posets will always have fixed points definition 17 we say that p p is a fixed point of p if p p for all in t p remark 1 note that if p 1 p 2 pn are maximal elements inp then any maximal element in pi is necessarily a fixed point of p this is relevant because one can easily show that if m n are two a p modules and dimk m p 6 dimk n p for some fixed point p p then d m n where d d d and d is any metric on p if p is a fixed point of p and dimk m p dimk n p then the diagram below does not commute for any morphisms and any translations since the composition cannot have full rank as required thus d m n n p n p n p m p m p n p p idn p p p p in particular this says that if p is a fixed point of p with p supp m p supp n then d m n because of this there is no hope of realizing any honest metric as an interleaving metric on any finite poset for example for poset c of example 2 and for any choice of metric d the resulting interleaving metric on isomorphism classes of modules is the infinite discrete lawvere metric with this in mind we make the following modification we set p p with added relations p for all p p we may now view a p mod as the full subcategory of a p modules where all objects are supported in p now there exist p interleavings between any 9 two a p modules note that the hasse quiver for p is simply the hasse quiver for p with added edges connecting maximal elements of p to we now build the metric d attaching positive weights to each edge of the hasse quiver of p continuing with poset c from example 2 we now have one of the below v 12 v 3 2 v 3 4 v 5 4 w 2 w 1 w 3 1 2 3 4 5 general choice of weights a a a a b b b 1 2 3 4 5 so called democratic choice of weights in the democratic case on the right the arrows in the hasse quiver of p which were actually in hasse quiver for p are labeled with one weight while the new arrows are all labeled with a different value of particular interest is when a b n n see remark 2 below we will confine our attention to this case in this paper for an analysis of the non democratic case see mm 17 when the hasse quiver for p is as above we will say that a b is a weight definition 18 now we let da b denote the weighted graph metric on the hasse quiver of p and letd be a category then d d da b is the interleaving metric corresponding to the weight a b on dp with this modification since any two generalized persistence modules can be interleaved d defines the structure of a finite metric space on the isomorphism classes of elements of dp we will now write t p for t p and from this point forward we suspend all posets at infinity remark 2 ultimately we wish to consider a function defined on a full subcategory of isomor phism classes of a p modules equipped with the interleaving distance d d da b of course if the function j in our workflow diagram takes values in a metric space x with finite diameter one can always choose a b diam x diam x to make the function a contraction thus in future work we endow the weightspace n nwith the lexicographic ordering and will consider minimal weights a b such that the function in question is a contraction for d d da b when the category d is k modules d d da b will be our interleaving distance on the cate gory c dp a p mod we now endow the set of isomorphism classes of a p modules with the other metric structure 3 4 bottleneck metrics a bottleneck metric provides an alternate metric structure on the set of isomorphsim classes of a p modules or indeed any subcategory c generated by a fixed collec tion of indecomposable modules the construction begins with a metric d 2 on a set where is a subset of isomorphism classes of indecomposable a p modules additionally we require a function w 0 compatible with d 2 in the sense that for all 1 2 w 1 w 2 d 2 1 2 following bl 13 bl 16 we define a matching between two multisets s t of to be a bijection f s t between multisubsets s s and t t for 0 we say a matching f is an matching if the following conditions hold 10 i for all s s w s s s ii for all t t w t t t and iii d 2 s f s for all s s since intuitivelyw measures the size of an element of we callw the width of sigma thus in an matching elements of s and t which are actually identified are within while all those not identified have width at most given a a p module m the barcode of m b m is the multiset of the isomorphism classes of indecomposable summands of m with their corresponding multiplicities thus b m is pre cisely a multiset of elements in when is the set of all isomorphism classes of indecomposable modules definition 19 let s t be two finite multisubsets of any set suppose d 2 and w are compatible then the bottleneck distance between s and t is defined by db s t inf r there exists and matching between s t let be any fixed subset of isomorphism classes of indecomposablea p modules ifm n are a p modules with the property that every indecomposable summand of m or n is isomorphic to an element of then we may identifym n with their barcodesb m b n two multisubsets of then set db m n db b m b n while there are many examples of bottleneck metrics in the literature in this paper we will choose d 2 to be the interleaving metric corresponding to the weight a b restricted to where is the set of convex modules our width will be an algebraic analogue of the width of the support of a one dimensional persistence module in the next subsection we define our subcategory c 3 5 the category generated by convex modules since a finite poset p may have the property that a p mod is of wild representation type a characterization of all of the isomorphsim classes of its indecomposable modules might not be possible moreover an indecomposable module is not determined by its support see definition 6 let denote the set of isomorphism classes of indecomposable a p modules clearly the function supp p p which sends m supp supp m its support may have infinite and unknowable domain but always has finite range motivated by one dimensional persistent homology we normalize taking the perspective that the width of an inde composable should be determined only by its support we therefore restrict out attention to the category c generated by an appropriate set of indecomposable thin modules a module is thin if its dimension vector consists of only zeros and ones definition 20 an indecomposable module m is convex if it thin and if it is isomorphic to a module m where m satisfies for all x y supp m with x y the linear map m x y is given by idk let c be the full subcategory of a p modules which are direct sums only of convex modules this is the full subcategory of a p modules that we will focus on we note that in the literature convex modules are sometimes called interval modules see bl 16 we use convex instead to avoid confusion with either subsets of the poset p or elements of its poset algebra a p in particular some convex modules are supported in an honest interval in the poset while others are not clearly when restricted to the set of isomorphism classes of convex modules the functionm supp m is one to one of course the function is not onto as not every subset of p is the support of a convex module one easily checks that if s p then there exists a convex modulem unique up to isomorphism with supp m s if and only if 11 i for all s 1 s 2 s there exists an unoriented path in the hasse quiver of p that connects s 1 and s 2 staying entirely within s and ii for all s 1 s 2 s the set p p s 1 p s 2 s 1 s 2 s in the above an unoriented path is a product of paths and their formal inverses if s satisfies i we say s is connected and if s satisfies ii we say s is interval convex regardless of the representation type of the poset p is convex is finite it is well known that if p has no crowns a subposet of a certain form then every indecompos able thina p module is a convex module acmt 05 on the other hand when p has non trivial cohomology many indecomposable thin modules will not be convex see example 4 below from fei 76 while the class of posets we will restrict to in the next section contain many posets of wild representation type they all have the property that every indecomposable thin is convex example 4 consider the posets given below 2 4 6 1 3 5 f 3 4 1 2 g the convex modules for the algebra with poset f have supports given by the following subsets 1 2 3 4 1 2 1 3 2 4 3 4 3 5 4 6 5 6 1 2 3 1 3 5 2 3 4 2 4 6 3 4 5 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 5 2 3 4 5 2 4 5 6 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 poset g has the property that when k is infinite there are infinitely many non isomorphic in decomposable thin modules modules with full support of course there is exactly one convex module with full support convex modules are of interest in representation theory for example in a large class of alge bras each simple modules can be associated to a collection in fact a poset of convex modules in such a way that the representation type of the algebra can be determined in an effective fash ion dn 92 dn 99 rin 91 in persistent homology similar classes of generalized persistence moduels have frequently been used see co 16 bl 16 from the perspective of representation theory it is easy to see that all of the indecomposable projectives and injectives and all simples modules are convex moreover since convex modules are uniquely determined by their support we agree with the sentiment in bl 16 that c is the correct categorical framework for generalized persistence modules for p when p has arbitrary representation type 4 a particular class of posets in this section we confine our discussion to a certain class of finite posets though easy to describe most such posets are of wild representation type see the discussion in subsection 3 2 we will restrict to c the full subcategory of a p modules which are isomorphic to a direct sum of convex modules let p be a finite poset such that 1 p has a unique minimal element m 2 for every maximal element mi p the interval m mi is totally ordered and 12 3 m mi m mj m for all i 6 j as a technical convenience we sometimes also assume 4 their exists an i 0 with m mi 0 m mi for all i 6 i 0 that is p is a tree which brances only at the its unique minimal element and has one totally ordered segment longer than the others definition 21 if p satisfies conditions 1 2 3 we say p is an n vee where n denotes the number of maximal elements in p if in addition p satisfies 4 we say that p is an asymmetric n vee clearly a 1 vee is exactly a finite totally ordered set it is easy to see that every 1 vee is an asymmetric we will prove our isometry theorem for n vees example 5 poset d in example 2 is an asymmetric 3 vee with wild representation type remark 3 the convex modules for n vees have some nice properties note that if p is any finite poset then the following two statements are equivalent i p has a unique minimal element m and every maximal interval in p m mi is totally or dered ii the support of every convex module has a unique minimal element that is to say finite posets satisfying only properties 1 and 2 in the definition for n vees are precisely those posets for which the support of a convex module always has a unique minimal element the proof is easy but we include it proof first if p is as above from the characterization of convex modules in subsection 3 5 it is clear that the support of each convex module has a unique minimal element on the other hand for a contradiction suppose p satisfies ii but not i let s p denote the support of a potential convex module if p has at least two minimals then set s p thus it must be the case tht p has a unique minimal m if there is a maximal interval m mj contained in p with m mj not totally ordered then there exist x y m mj with x y not comparable but then s x mj y mj is the support of a convex module contradicting ii we will now establish some properties of the collection of translations of an asymmetric n vee much but not all carries over to general n vees see the end of the proof of theorem 1 lemma 22 let p be an asymmetric n vee and let a b be any weights let d da b denote the weighted graph metric on the hasse quiver of p corresponding to a b then i for each h t p the set t p h has a unique maximal element ii the set is totally ordered and if and only if iii if t p with h h then there exists a with and h max h h proof let p be as above first say n 1 then p m mi with m mi 0 of maximal cardinality let ti m mi 1 so by hypothesis ti 0 ti for all i 6 i 0 let t max ti i 6 i 0 note that if p was not asymmetric t ti 0 let h t p and suppose h if m m then at b since if m then h ati 0 b if m m mi 0 then h at b and if m m mi i 6 i 0 then h ati 0 b 13 therefore if at b m m then where x m if x m max y m mi d x y if x m mi on the other hand if ati 0 b at b then m m mi 0 and m mi for i 6 i 0 in this case where x x m mi i 6 i 0 max y m mi 0 d x y if x m mi 0 lastly if ati 0 b then where x for all x note that the formulae above are well defined since m mi m mj m for all i 6 j now suppose that n 1 then where x max y x d x y for any this proves i the expressions for show that ii holds now let t p with h h and suppose max h h without loss of generality say h h then and h by i ii as required the important observation is that although t p is not totally ordered for n 1 it is directed in such a way that one may pass to a larger translation without increasing the height in contrast for an arbitrary finite poset p t p will still be a directed set because we suspended at infinity it may be the case however that for all 0 with 0 h 0 max h h that is to say one may have to pay a price when passing to any larger common translation lemma 22 shows that this does not happen for asymmetric n vees we are now ready to define the width of a convex module lemma 23 let p be an asymmetric n vee and let a b be a weight then for all i convex the following are equal i w i w 1 i min t p h h and hom i i 0 ii w 2 i min t p h and hom i i 2 0 iii w 3 i min t p with hom i i 2 0 before proving lemma 23 we note that for any i convex and for any t p hom i i 6 0 x supp i x supp i x supp i for x minimal in supp i this follows from general properties of module homomorphisms and the observation in re mark 3 that convex modules for n vees have unique minimal elements see the section 5 for a detailed analysis of homomorphisms and translations using this fact we see that if and hom i i 0 then hom i i 0 thus this condition defining w produces an interval in h t p we will now prove lemma 23 proof let t p with h h and suppose hom i i 0 and max h h then by lemma 22 there exists with h and then 2 so hom i i 2 0 so w 3 i w 2 i w i but s t inf s inf t thus w 3 i w 2 i w i so all are equal with this equivalence established we define the width of a convex module definition 24 let p be an asymmetric n vee and let a b be a weight let i be convex then w i w 1 i min t p h h and hom i i 0 while this definition of the width of a module is formulated algebraically and is natural con sidering the structure of t p it is not without complication intuitively 1 2 supp i or perhaps d 1 2 supp i e is a first approximation of w i indeed this is the discrete analogue of the width 14 used in the classical isometry theorem bl 13 as their work corresponds to translations that are exactly constant shifts this discrete analogue of this is the choice of weights a b 1 1 on a 1 vee for an n vee however modules with smaller support may happen to have large widths or the opposite for example if p is a 2 vee and i is the simple convex module supported at m then w i at b in contrast if x m mi and j is the convex module supported at x w j a moreover any convex module supported at mi for some i necessarily has width greater or equal to b this is relevant as no relation between a and b is specified the following proposition will prove useful in section 6 when we produce an explicit matching for 1 vees this result is an analogue of the corresponding statement in bl 13 proposition 25 let p be an asymmetric n vee let a iai c j cj be in c for any module m let b m denote the barcode of m viewed as a multiset and let t p then i if a f c is an injection then for all d p the set i d is a maximal totally ordered subset of supp ai j d is a maximal totally ordered subset of supp cj and ii if a g c is a surjection then for all b p j b is a maximal totally ordered subset of supp cj i b is a maximal totally ordered subset of supp ai iii if a and c are interleaved and a c is one of the homomorphisms then for all i in b ker w i h iv if a and c are interleaved and a c is one of the homomorphisms then for all j in b cok w j h before proving the proposition 25 we state a lemma lemma 26 let p be an asymmetric n vee say p m mi with m mi totally ordered let mi min m mi and let ij be the left ideal in a p generated by mi i 6 j then i for any m convex m ijm is 0 if supp m m mj the convex module with support given by supp m m mj otherwise ii for a b c if f is a homomorphism a f b ijb then f factors through a ija proof i obvious statement ii is clear since for f a b ijb w ij f w a w f a 0 note that if n 1 the left ideal ii is identically zero but the above is still true we now prove proposition 25 proof let a c be as above for all i let ai a p xi xi supp ai and let xi xi be a maximal connected totally ordered subset of supp ai we do not suppose xi m similarly let yj be such that cj a p yj for i j let f ij ai cj now suppose a f c is an injection fix i 0 and xi 0 xi 0 be maximal contained in supp ai 0 since f i 0 f i 0 j ai 0 j cj is an inclusion for any t xi 0 xi 0 there exists j t with f i 0 j t 6 0 since f i 0 j t is a homomorphism f i 0 j t 6 0 f i 0 j t xi 0 6 0 and it is not that case that there exists xi 0 with supp cj 0 set j 0 j xi 0 therefore j xi 0 xi 0 supp cj and for all xi 0 supp cj 6 15 now for d p let j d j d supp cj supp cj for d and i d i d supp ai supp ai for d clearly i d 6 j d 6 now let d p d 6 m with i d 6 say d m mk then i i d ai ikai j j d d d cj ikcj c ikc i i d ai ika d j j d d d cj ikcj d j j d cj ikcj d where the above inclusions are induced from f and the inclusion of a submodule into a larger module respectively thus i d j d if d m then i i m ai j j m cj c i i m ai m j j m cj m c m so i m j m this proves i the proof of ii is similar though one inducts on the the cardinality of s b b is a maximal totally ordered subset of ai for some ai now we prove iii for a contradiction suppose there exists an i b ker with hom i i 2 6 0 but then the diagram below commutes i i 2 j cj i thus i 6 0 a contradiction this proves iii now let j b cok for a contradiction suppose w j h but then there exists x x a maximal subinterval in supp j with 2 x x let bx im bx im be the correspond ing basis elements for j but then there exists j such that 1 x x supp cj and 2 cj y im for x y x then x x supp cj 2 x 2 x x which is in the support of cj therefore w cj h but then the following diagram commutes cj x cj 2 x cj 2 x j x but then cj 2 x im x a contradiction this proves iv and finishes the proof the example below shows that i ii in the proposition 25 cannot be extended from maximal totally ordered intervals to convex subsets 16 example 6 consider the 2 vee m m 1 m m 2 where m x m 1 and m y z m 2 let c 1 be the convex module supported on m x m 1 and c 2 be the convex module supported on m y z m 2 say c 1 has basis em ex em 1 and c 2 has basis fm fy fz fm 2 then the submod ule of c 1 c 2 with basis em fm ex em 1 fy fz fm 2 is isomorphic to the convex module with full support thus leta 1 be the convex module with full support then a 1 c 1 c 2 and while one can make the claim in the proposition for each maximal totally ordered subset of the support of a 1 separately one cannot do so simultaneously in the next section we study homomorphisms and translations and their properties in c 5 homomorphisms and translations in this section we investigate the relationship between homomorphisms and translations in the category c in the interest of generality we will relax our hypotheses on the poset p in this section unless otherwise specified p is any finite poset the functions defined in definitions 27 28 are analogues of functions used by bauer and lesnick bl 13 in this context however they fail to preserve w and may annihilate a convex module note that if s p is non empty and interval convex then it canonically determines the iso morphism class of an element of c under the identification s mi where supp mi is the ith connected component of s we use this in the definition below definition 27 let p be any finite poset and m be convex say supp m i ai bi where ai bi are maximal intervals in supp m and let t p then m is the element of c given by supp m s i ai bi that is m is the direct sum determined by s i ai bi note that if ai bi then ai bi is empty one easily checks that i if p is an n vee m is convex or 0 and ii for a general poset p m is a submodule of m moreover for i p m i x im m x x i im m x 0 x 0 i for any x 0 x 0 i that is i m i im m x 0 x 0 i for any x 0 x 0 i now for m c arbitrary set m t m t where m t mt if p has the property that for all i p i is totally ordered one can still find x x i such that m i im m x x i is still valid thus in particular the result holds for as n vee note that if i is not totally ordered then m i x im m x x i when p is an n vee we now make a dual definition definition 28 let p be an n vee and let m be a convex module say supp m i x xi where each x xi mi recall that since p is an n vee the support of each convex module has a 17 minimal element so xi 6 x for more than one i implies x m let t p then m is the convex modules with supp m equal to i x x n i i where x n i i max y y xi y x note that if no such xn i i exists m 0 one easily checks that i if m is convex m is either identically zero or convex and ii m is a quotient of m because of i we may extend our definition from to c for m c set m t mt where m t mt notice that the assignment m m moves the left endpoints of the support of a module to the right while m m moves the right endpoints of the support to the left a physical characterization of m is possible but will prove unecessary for our purposes we now prove a useful proposition proposition 29 let p be an n vee and let i m c let be a interleaving betweem i and m say i m then i i 2 is a quotient of both i and im and ii m 2 is a submodule of both m and im proof first by the comments above i 2 is a quotient of i now since i and m are interleaved i i 2 therefore im i 2 and hence i 2 is a homomorphic image and hence a quotient of im this proves i we now prove ii first already m is a submodule of m moreover c d implies c d for any t p hence m 2 is a submodule of m it remains to show that m 2 is a submodule of im let i p i supp m 2 then as a vector spaces m 2 i im i k coker i let i m 2 i note that i i at the i level i ai bi with ai im i and bi coker i then i im m x 2 x i i m x 2 x i ax bx ax im bx coker m x 2 x i ax ai i with i im and m x 2 x i bx i bi but by proposition 25 w coker h thus i bi 0 and therefore i bi 0 hence i was fully contained in im i thus im m x 2 x i im i for all i hence m 2 i im i for all i 18 therefore m 2 im this proves ii we will now consider the action of t p on c 0 we first point out that in general the monoid t p need not act on 0 example 7 let p be the poset e in example 2 and let be the translation 1 1 2 4 3 4 4 let j be the convex module with support equal to 2 3 4 then j s t where s is the simple supported on 2 and t is the simple supported on 3 alternatively let p be the poset 1 2 3 with 1 2 not comparable let j be the convex module with full support and be given by 1 1 2 2 3 then j is again a direct sum of two convex modules example 7 shows that the action of t p on c 0 need not restrict to 0 in lemma 31 we will see that when p is an n vee however the action does restrict first a quick observation lemma 30 let p be any poset with a unique minimal element m and suppose t p with m m then for all convex j with m supp j j is convex proof let p be as above m be convex with m supp m let be a translation with m m clearly m is thin let t 1 t 2 be in the support of m and suppose t 1 t t 2 then t 1 t 2 supp m t 1 t 2 supp m since m is convex since t t 1 t 2 t is in the support of m so t 1 t 2 supp m now since m m m x for all x supp m is connected lemma 31 let p be an n vee i a convex module and t p then i is either the zero module or convex proof first from the proof of lemma 30 if non zero i is in c we now proceed in cases first suppose m supp i if m m then m is in the support of i so i is convex on the other hand if m m mi then for all j 6 i m mj supp i but then supp i m mi hence it is convex or zero since it is interval convex ifm supp i then i is supported in m mj for some j and the result follows we will now work towards the characterization of homomorphism between convex modules when p is an n vee in the interest of generality we begin with an arbitrary finite poset p definition 32 let i m be convex let ex x supp i fx x supp m be k bases for i m respectively consider the linear function i m defined by i m ey fy if y supp i supp m 0 otherwise by inspection i m is a non zero module homomorphism if and only if supp i supp m satisfies i supp i supp m 6 ii x supp i supp m y x y supp m y supp i and iii x supp i supp m y x y supp i y supp m note that even when it is not a module homomorphsim i m can be viewed as the linear extension of supp i supp m the characteristic function on the intersection of the supports of i and m the following two lemmas will allow us to conclude that when p is an n vee up to a k scalar this is the only possible module homomorphisms from i to m 19 lemma 33 let p be any finite poset and let i m be convex let s supp i supp m with s nonempty suppose that there exists an n c with supp n s then n is isomorphic to the image of a non zero module homomorphsim from i to m if and only if a for all x s if y supp i with y x then y s and b for all x s if y supp m with y x then y s proof s corresponds to the support of a non zero quotient module of i if and only if s satisfies a similarly s corresponds to a non zero submodule of m if and only if s satisfies b since any homomorphism can be factored into an injection after a surjection the result follows lemma 34 let p be an n vee let i m be convex modules then hom i m k or 0 as a vector space proof first let p be any finite poset and i m be convex suppose that g is any non zero ho momorpism from i to m then by lemma 33 im g i ker g has support equal to s supp i supp m satisfying a b from lemma 33 we will show that any such s is a union of connected components of supp i supp m since g is non zero s is non empty now let s s and suppose that y supp i supp m with y s then by b y s similarly if y supp i supp m with y s then by a y s therefore s contains the connected component of s in supp i supp m the result follows now if p is an n vee supp i supp m is connected so s must be the full intersection as above let ex x supp i fx x supp m be k bases for i m respectively then g ez czfz if z supp i supp m cz k 0 otherwise where supp i supp m satisfy conditions i ii and iii from below definition 32 clearly every non zero quotient of i must have support containing the minimal element t of supp i then since i m are convex g i t y et gey m t y get m t y ctft ctfy cyfy therefore g ct i m of course if g is identically zero g is still in the span of i m we now investigate the action of t p on hom i m when i m are convex from the ob servation in the proof of lemma 34 we see that for p arbitrary hom i m will have dimension equal to the number of connected components of supp i supp m still for a fixed translation t p hom i m may be trivial even when i m are non zero we now state a con dition which ensures that hom i m 6 0 this can be done more generally but we state the result only for p an n vee lemma 35 let p be an n vee and let i m be convex let t p say hom i m 6 0 and there exists t with t supp i supp m then hom i m 6 0 proof since t supp i supp m i and m are not zero also by lemma 34 supp i and supp m satisfy the conditions i ii and iii from below definiton 32 since i m are convex it is enough to show that the above still holds for supp i and supp m again t supp i supp m hence the intersection is nonempty now let z supp i supp m with w supp m w z then z supp i supp m w supp m and w z therefore z supp i so z supp i the last requirement is proved similarly note that conditions ii and iii are clearly inherited from i m the authors point out that the hypothesis above that the intersection of supports coincides with the image of the translation is required even on a totally ordered set see example 8 below 20 example 8 let p be the totally ordered set 1 2 3 4 5 6 with its standard ordering and let send 1 2 2 3 3 3 4 5 5 6 6 6 let i and m be the convex modules supported on 4 5 6 and 3 4 respectively note that hom i m 6 i and m are supported on 4 5 and 2 3 respectively clearly the supports of i and m are disjoint so hom i m 0 notation 36 let p be an n vee t p and say i is convex we write i for i i as i is either zero or convex for i c we write i for the canonical homomorphism as well since it is necessarily diagonal of course as mentioned above even if i is not trivial it may be the case that i is identically zero we can now show that when p is an n vee the collection of interleavings between two elements of c will have the structure of an affine variety not necessarily irreducible though the result still holds for more general posets our proof is an application of the results of this section some examples are provided in section 8 proposition 37 let p be an n vee and let i is m mt be two elements of c let t p then the collection of interleavings between i and m has the structure of an affine variety indeed as stated above the result holds for any finite poset though when p is an n vee the variety has a simpler description we sketch the proof let p i m be as above and let be any interleaving between i and m thus we obtain the commutative triangles below i i i m m m i m therefore as matrices of module homomorphisms ts st is and s t ts mt where decompose into their component homomorphisms st is mt and ts mt is respectively by lemma 34 st t s are in the span of is mt and mt is respectively hence if hom is mt is not identically zero st s t is mt where s t k with a similar result holding for ts in addition a b 0 a 0 b 0 for all scalars translations 0 and alla b convex therefore the interleavings between i and m correspond to the algebraic set given by values of st t s satisfying all quadratic relations obtained by evaluating the matrix equations above at all elements of p more precisely first suppose hom is mt hom mt is 0 for all s t in this case the vari ety of interleavings v i m is given by v i m the zero variety if w is w mt max h h for all s t the empty variety otherwise the above cases correspond to whether or not setting all morphisms identically equal to zero corresponds to an admissible interleaving between i and m on the other hand suppose some of the relevant spaces of homomorphisms above are non zero then let rst q t s be given by rst s t dimk hom is mt and qts ts dimk hom mt is also let r st r s t dimk hom is mt 2 and q ts qts dimk hom mt is 2 21 let r denote the t s matrix r rst is mt similarly let q denote the s t matrix q qts mt is also set r r s t is mt 2 q q t s mt is 2 then since st s t is mt and t s t s mt is the homomorphisms and correspond to an interleaving if and only if the equations below are satisfied when evaluated at all elements of the poset p q r q ts mt is 2 r s t is mt is r q r st is mt 2 q t s mt is 2 mt 1 therefore in this situation v i m is the affine algebraic set with coordinate ring given by k st hom is mt 6 0 ts hom mt is 6 0 modulo the ideal given by all identities from 1 for some computations see examples 10 11 when p is not an n vee or at least a tree branching only at a unique minimal element the collection of interleavings still admits the structure of a variety though the description is more cumbersome remark 4 using proposition 37 we may visualize the interleaving distance between two ele ments of c as follows let a b be any weight and let i m c for each h let v i m denote the variety of interleavings between i and m then d i m min the variety v i m is non empty for some computations see example 12 we now observe that our width gives rise to a bottleneck metric when p is an n vee for this w must be compatible with the interleaving distance in the sense of subsection 3 4 proposition 38 let p be an n vee and let a b be weights letd d da b be the interleaving distance and w be the width function then for i m convex w i w j d i j the proof which proceeds in cases is omitted since w and d are compatible on we obtain a bottleneck metric on the category c see subsection 3 4 let db denote this bottleneck metric in the next section we will prove an isometry theorem for 1 vees 6 isometry theorem for finite totally ordered sets we now prove the isometry theorem for finite totally ordered sets we will fix notation in this section for our poset let p m m 1 m 2 n m 1 m n be totally ordered a 1 vee and fix any weight a b note that in this section only n does not correspond to the number of maximal elements in p we begin with some preliminary observations lemma 39 let p m m 1 m 2 n m 1 m n and suppose be a power of a maximal translation with given height then i im p m n ii if i m n then 1 i is a singleton iii i j p i j or i j n the result follows from the form of the maximal translation see the proof of lemma 22 note that the power of a maximal translation need not be maximal moreover h 2 need not be 2 h the following lemma follows from our characterization of the homomorphisms between convex modules in the last section see lemma 34 22 lemma 40 if i j are convex modules for p m m 1 m 2 n m 1 m n then hom i j 6 0 if and only if the endpoints of supp i x x and supp j y y satisfy y x y x as previously mentioned any homomorphism is a scalar in k times i j see definition 32 lemma 41 let p be as above and suppose is a maximal translation let a and b be convex and suppose a b 6 0 and hom a b 6 0 then hom a b 6 0 proof let s supp a supp b if s im we are done by lemma 35 otherwise x y im is empty where supp a x x supp b y y with y x y x as in lemma 40 but then by lemma 39 y y is disjoint from the image of therefore b 0 a contradiction lastly the following is an easy consequences of the results of the previous section see defini tions 27 28 lemma 42 let p be totally ordered then the following are equivalent i hom j j 2 6 0 ii there is an x supp j with 2 x supp j iii j 2 6 0 iv j 2 6 0 v j 2 6 0 we are now ready to prove that every interleaving induces a matching of barcodes when p is a 1 vee this is very much an algebraic reformulation of the results of bauer and lesnick in bl 13 applied to our framework we will make use of their canonical matchings of barcodes induced by injective or surjective module homomorphisms definition 43 see section 4 in bl 13 let p be totally ordered and let i s s is m t t mt be in c let f be a module homomorphism from i f m then i if f is surjective let f from b m to b i be the canonical matching of barcodes ii if f is injective let f from b i to b m be the canonical matching of barcodes recall from bl 13 is categorical on injections or surjections that is f g h f g h surjec tions implies f h g and dually f g h f g h injections implies f g h the authors wish to emphasize that the above statements holds for any permissable enumera tion on each barcode that is to say for each module m all isomorphic elements of the barcode b m may be enumerated arbitrarily this enumeration is then fixed in one instance it will be convenient though not necessary to choose explicitly an enumeration for a particular barcode we now establish some additional properties of convex modules for 1 vees lemma 44 let p m n be a 1 vee a maximal translation on p let be the set of isomophism classes of convex modues let f g be the functions f g 0 where f 2 and g 2 let 0 w h and be 0 supp x x with 2 x n i f 0 and f is one to one on 0 ii g 0 and g is one to one on 0 also g n where n is the convex module with support n 23 proof we will show that if 1 2 0 withf 1 f 2 then 1 2 since convex modules are characterized by their supports say f 1 f 2 have shared support x x thenx is maximal such that 2 x x 1 and also such that 2 x x 2 where 1 2 have support given by x x 1 and x x 2 respectively but then by lemma 39 x 1 x 2 so 1 2 this proves i for ii we ll prove the contrapositive suppose 1 2 0 have supports given by x 1 x 1 x 2 x 2 respectively suppose 2 x 1 2 x 2 n then by lemma 39 x 1 x 2 then again by lemma 39 g 1 x 1 g 2 x 2 which are distinct on the other hand if x 1 x 2 x 1 x 2 n then 2 1 2 2 have supports given by 2 x 1 x 1 2 x 1 x 2 respectively but then since only x 2 is possibly equal to n the right endpoint of the support of g 2 is strictly larger than the right endpoint of the support of g 1 clearly if the support of is x n with 2 x n then by inspection g n moreover it is clear from the proof that g 1 n proposition 45 let p be totally ordered and let c be the full subcategory of a p modules consisting of direct sums of convex modules let a b n n be a weight and let d denote interleaving distance corresponding to the weight a b restricted to c let w m min hom m m 0 t p h h and let db be the bottleneck distance on c corresponding to the interleaving distance and w then the identity is an isometry from c d id c db this corresponds to the case that p is a 1 vee in theorem 1 the result follows from theorem 2 we will proceed in the same fashion as bl 13 before continuing we point out that theorem 2 and later theorem 1 do not say that every interleaving is diagonal see examples 10 11 instead they simply constrain the isomorphism classes of modules which admit an interleaving theorem 2 let p be totally ordered p is a 1 vee and let i s s is m t t mt be in c let t p be maximal with h suppose there exists a interleaving between i and m then there exists a h matching from b i to b m the proof of the theorem will consist of three parts 1 if w is h then is is matched 2 if w mt h then mt is matched 3 if is and mt are matched independent of w then there is a interleaving between is and mt our matching is a slight modification of the matching in bl 13 it is given by the following composition see definition 43 b i 1 b im b m b m m b m where is the inclusion from im into m is the surjection from i to im and b m m is the natural inclusion of barcodes induced from m to m given by b m m mt mt note that in bl 13 it was only necessary to take the matching as far asb m there that was justified since the assignment which we call b m m was a bijection between barcodes which preserved w in the present context neither of these properties hold specifically b m may be strictly smaller than b m moreover either of w mt w mt may be strictly larger than the other the detailed schematic below displays all relevant convex modules this will be useful in the proof 24 w x maximal w x minimal 2 x 0 x maximal z y 0 y z maximal y z minimal is is i 2 s qs t m 2 t mt mt w w x x x x 0 x y y 0 y y y z z we now prove theorem 2 proof first say is b i with w is h then by lemma 42 is 2 6 0 additionally by proposition 29 and since induced matchings are categorical for surjections we obtain the com mutative triangle of barcodes below i im i 2 b i b im b i 2 but the induced matching b i 2 b i sends i 2 s is up to isomorphism therefore is is matched with an element of b im that is is im but then since and b m are injections of barcodes is is matched with some mt b m this establishes 1 next suppose mt b m with w mt h then by lemma 42 m 2 t 6 0 moreover by proposition 29 and since induced matchings are categorical for injections we obtain a commu tative diagram of barcodes for any choice of admissible emumeration it is convenient to specify a particular enumeration for b m 2 this is done as follows for b m 2 n see lemma 44 there is no restriction on the enumeration restricted to for b m 2 n enumerate by 1 g 1 g 2 2 if and only if 1 2 with this choice of enumeration we obtain the commutative diagram below im m m 2 b im b m b m 2 b m since b is an injection of barcodes this proves 2 25 we now prove 3 first note that if is and mt are matched with h is h mt then setting both equal to zero we obtain a interleaving between is and mt therefore let s s h is and t t h mt we will write is l mt when is and mt are matched it remains to show that if is l mt then there is a interleaving between is and mt when a s s t t b s s t t or c s s t t note that because of the asymmetry associated with the matching the cases b and c are not identical let the supports of is is mt and mt be given by w w x x y y and z z respectively when s s let x 0 be maximal such that 2 x 0 x that is i 2 s has support given by x x 0 similarly when t t let y 0 z so then m 2 t has support given by y 0 y note that if z im we have that z 2 y and y m proceeding as in bl 13 by proposition 25 if is lmt then we have the relations y x y x hence there is a non zero homomorphism from is mt therefore set is mt x y this will be one of our interleaving morphisms we next define our second interleaving mor phism we must show that if one of a b or c is satisfied we have the relations w z w z by inspection it suffices to show the following statements i if t t then w z ii if s s then z w and w z iii if s s and t 6 t then w z iv if s 6 s and t t then z w and w z we now prove i through iv first if t t then z y 0 also w is minimal such that w x as x y 0 x z and so w z by minimality this proves i next say s s then z y by definition also since x y we have that y x as w is maximal such that w x and s s we have 2 x x therefore x w since x x x w therefore z y x w as required continuing since s s x 0 is maximal such that 2 x 0 x by the maximality of w x 0 w but then we have w x 0 y z since im includes into i 2 this proves ii now suppose s s t 6 t if x m then w x and so 3 w 2 x x since s s but then w 2 w hence since t 6 t we have 2 w w z 2 z the result follows from monoticity on the other hand if x m then w m so w z thus we have shown iii lastly say s s t t we must establish z w and w z first since t t we have that z y 0 y x since w is maximal with w x it follows that z w next note that if t t then w x since w 6 x x im then 2 z z z so y z therefore x is in im so it must be the case that w x but then since s 6 s t t we have w x 2 x 2 y 0 3 z z therefore w 6 n so by monoticity w z as required this proves iv thus we have shown that if s s or t t w z w z therefore set mt is z w this will be our second interleaving morphism it now remains only to show that 2 is and 2 mt 26 thus we have x y w y and z w y w where y is maximal such that y y and w is the maximal with w w we now proceed to establish the required commutativity conditions first say s s we will show that is is 2 x w note that by definition is a composition of module homomorphisms and hence a module homomorphism therefore by lemma 34 we need only show that the linear map x w is non zero at any vertex to do this we will establish that x w that is x w is non zero at x but s s 2 x x as w is maximal with 2 w x the inequality follows now say s s then 0 as required we now show the commutativity of the other triangle first suppose that t t as above we will show that mt mt 2 z y again we need only demonstrate that z y but t t 2 z z since y is maximal with 2 y z the result follows again if t t the result is trivial therefore if is l mt then there is a interleaving between is and mt as required this proves 3 and finishes the proof of the theorem in the next section we will use theorem 2 to prove our main result 7 proof of main results before proving the main results we establish some useful facts this first result will allow us to make a half matching lemma 46 let s t be sets with s finite let x s p t be a function such that for all 6 s 0 s s s 0 x s s 0 then there exists a function f s t such that f is an injection and for all s f s x s proof we prove the result by induction on s if s 1 the result is trivial now say s 1 and the result holds for all sets with smaller cardinality first suppose there exists a non empty subset s 0 s such that s s 0 x s s 0 let s 0 be a minimal non empty subset of s where equality holds we will show that we can define an injection f from s 0 to t with f s x s pick s 0 s 0 t 0 x s 0 and set f s 0 t 0 if s 0 s 0 we are done so assume s 0 6 s 0 then let x s 0 s 0 p t be defined by x s x s t 0 now let s be a non empty subset of s 0 s 0 then s s x s s s x s t 0 s s x s t 0 s 1 1 s by the minimality of s 0 thus by induction there exists a one to one function f s 0 s 0 t such that f s x s clearly f can be extended to an injection on all of s 0 if s 0 s set f f and we are done otherwise define x s s 0 p t be defined by x s x s f s 0 now let s 1 s 2 s x s s 0 clearly for all i x s i x s i ti for some set ti f s 0 note that i k x s i k s s 0 x s x s 1 x s 2 x s k s 0 k 27 a contradiction thus by induction there is an injection f s s 0 t with f s x s by construction f f f is the desired function from all of s to t on the other hand if s has the property that for all s 0 s s 0 6 s s 0 x s s 0 pick s 1 s t 1 x s 1 and set f s 1 t 1 again let x s s 1 p t be defined by x s x s t 1 then for s 0 s s 1 s s 0 x s s s 0 x s t 1 s 0 1 1 s 0 since s s 1 s the result holds by induction example 9 s 1 2 3 4 5 t a b c d e the function x given by 1 a b d 2 b c e 3 a c d 4 d 5 e a matching is constructed by setting f 4 d and f 5 e then one can choose any bijection from f 1 2 3 a b c we glue f and f to obtain an injection f from s to t next we make a simple observation about interleavings lemma 47 let p be any poset t p let a b c d be any a p modules with a interleaving between a b and c d then if hom a d 0 hom c b then a c are interleaved and b d are interleaved proof note that we do not assume any modules are in the category c for brevity let fa fb denote the canonical homomorphism from a a and b b respectively similarly let gc gd denote c c and d d respectively by decomposing into their component homomorphisms we have fa 0 0 fb ca d a 0 db ac b c 0 bd ca a c c a b c d a b d 0 db b d gc 0 0 gd ac b c 0 bd ca d a 0 db ac c a a c d a b c d b 0 bd d b thus by inspection if we set bc d a 0 the required condition will still be satisfied we point out that this does not say that the interleaving was initially diagonal see example 11 corollary 48 let p be a finite poset with a unique minimal element m let x y c and be a translation suppose x sxs and y t yt are interleaved and m m let sm s s xs m 6 0 tm t t yt m 6 0 then s sm xs t tm yt are interleaved and s sm xs t tm yt are interleaved proof this follows easily from lemma 47 proposition 49 let p be an n vee let i s s is m t t mt be in c suppose for all s t is and mt are supported at m let t p with m m suppose there exists a interleaving between i and m then there exists a h matching in the sense of theorem 2 from b i to b m 28 proof first we show that b i b m since m is fixed by the commutativity of the diagram below shows that b i rank f dim m m b m s s is m s s is 2 m s s is m t t mt m t t mt m thus by symmetry b i b m now let s s since is is 2 is nonzero its im age is in the image of i thus in particular there exists a t t with ts st 6 0 that is hom mt is 2 hom is mt 6 0 but by lemma 35 then hom is mt 2 is also not equal to zero so hom mt is 2 hom is mt 2 are both nonzero hence their composition is nonzero since it is defined at m but then up to a scalar it is the composition mt mt 2 since hom mt mt 2 k by lemma 34 thus there is a interleaving between is and mt we have shown that whenever ts s t is nonzero there is a interleaving between is and mt now for s s let x s t t ts st 6 0 let s 0 s then the diagram below commutes s s 0 is s s 0 is 2 t x s some s s 0 mt hence by evaluation at m s 0 rank s s 0 is m s s 0 is 2 m s s 0 x s then by lemma 46 there is an injection f from s to t with f s x s for all s the result follows since s t and t x s implies there is a interleaving between is and mt we are now ready to prove our main results proof of theorem 1 first let p be an asymmetric n vee p n mi with m mi 0 m mi for i 6 i 0 and fix the weight a b we will prove that any 1 1 interleaving between i m c produces an matching for max h 1 h 1 once this is established db d for the other inequality note that an matching yields after inserting appropriate zero homomorphisms a diagonal interleaving thus d db and hence equality let i s s is m t t mt be in c if v is a partition of p for v v let sv s s the minimal element of supp is is in v similarly define tv now suppose there is a 1 1 interleaving between i and m then by lemma 22 there exists maximal where max h 1 h 1 by bds 13 since 1 1 there exists a interleaving between i and m first if at b then m m in this case consider the partition v of p given by v m mi m and set sm s m si s m mi similarly set tm t m and ti t m mi since m m for all m convex supp m m mi m 6 0 supp m m mi and m supp m m supp m 29 therefore if s sm t ti then hom is mt 0 similarly if t tm s si then hom mt is 0 then by lemma 47 we may diagonalize obtaining interleavings between s sm is and t tm mt and also between s sm is and t tm mt we now diagonalize further again since m m for each i 6 j s si t tj hom is mt 0 as well as the symmetric condition thereofore by applying lemma 47 re peatedly we obtain interleavings between s sv is and t tv mt for all v v hence by proposition 49 we get a matching between the elements of the barcodes supported at m also for each i m mi is a maximal translation on a totally oriented set therefore for each i we acquire a matching between those elements of the barcode in si and ti by theorem 2 thus an matching is produced piecewise now suppose h at b then for all convex modules m m is identically 0 or is a convex module supported in m mi 0 then m m ii 0 m thus any homomorphism from n m factors through n ii 0 n consider the partition v m mi 0 m mi i 6 i 0 and set si s m mi sm s m mi 0 similarly define tm ti then for s sm t ti hom is mt 0 since mt 0 since the symmetric condition holds as well again by lemma 47 we obtain an interleaving between s sm is and t tm mt and between s sm is and t tm mt respectively since the latter interleaving corresponds to convex modulesn withw n it suffices to match only convex modules with indices in sm and tm however the morphisms s sm is t tm mt and t tm mt s sm is factor through s sm is ii 0 is and t tm mt ii 0 mt respectively thus since m mi 0 is maximal again the result follows from theorem 2 if p is an n vee but is not asymmetric then we may not use lemmas 22 and 23 explicitly it is still the case however that for h t p with at b the set h has a unique maximal element moreover the set at b is still totally ordered thus if i m are interleaved with max h h at b the proof above still goes through on the other hand when p is not asymmetric for all convex modules w at b ati 0 b therefore though there is not a unique translation with height corresponding to this value interleavings of this height always produce empty matchings 8 examples we conclude with some examples first in example 10 we decompose an interleaving as in the proof of theorem 1 we also compute the varieties see proposition 37 corresponding to two interleavings along the way we construct some non diagonal interleavings in this section if m is convex with support given by s we write m s 30 example 10 let p be the 2 vee p m x 3 m y 6 and let a b be a weight let a consider the following convex modules m y 1 y 2 x 1 x 2 a m x 2 m y 2 m y 1 x 1 x 2 b m x 2 m y 1 m y 1 y 2 x 1 x 2 c m x 2 m y 2 m y 1 y 2 x 1 d m x 1 m y 2 y 3 y 4 y 5 x y 3 y 5 y 3 y 4 y 5 y y 3 y 5 y 4 y 5 z y 4 y 5 let i a b x andm c d y z we will decompose an arbitrary interleaving between i and m as in the proof of theorem 1 then we will calculate the varieties see remark 37 corresponding to the factored interleavings the decomposition produces on the appropriate partition of the barcodes b i and b m first let be any interleaving between i and m by lemma 47 since m m there exist a interleaving between a b and c d and a interleaving between x and y z we treat these separately referring to each in turn as first we factor each into their corresponding summands adopting the previous notation for example xy x y since i m c we know that xy x y and x y x y 2 of course all other similar identities hold as well we first concentrate on the modules sup ported in m my thus we have the diagrams below 2 x 2 y z x x 2 y z y z y z 2 x therefore we have the matrices of module homorphisms xy x y xz x z and yx y x z x z x since is a a a interleaving between x and y z equations 2 and 3 below must hold first 2 x 2 x yx x y z x x z 2 x 2 and then 2 y z 2 y 0 0 2 z y y 2 z y 2 y z 2 z z 2 3 31 note that the above equations define the variety v x y z because in the notation of propo sition 37 no variables are deleted between r and r and q and q respectively for computational purposes it is convenient to arrange the relevant convex modules side by side y 5 y 4 y 3 y 2 y 1 x y z x y z x 2 y 2 z 2 notice that evaluating 2 at all elements of p we have 2 x y 3 1 and 2 x i 0 for any i 6 y 3 similarly evaluating 3 we have 2 y z y 3 1 0 0 0 and 2 y z i 0 0 0 0 for i 6 y 3 therefore we get the following system of equations 1 1 0 thus v x y z is the affine variety with coordinate ring k modulo the ideal 1 1 see proposition 37 this corresponds to one choice of parameter in k and one in k next consider the modules supported at m we now compute the variety v a b c d again we must have the commutative triangles below 2 a b 2 c d a b a b 2 c d c d c d 2 a b decomposing we have ac e a c b c f b c ad g a d b d h b d and ca i c a d a j d a cb k c b d b l d b since is a interleaving between a b and c d and since no variables are elimi nated from q to q we have 2 a b 2 a 0 0 2 b ei gj a a 2 fi hj b a 2 ek gl a b 2 fk hl b b 2 evaluating everything at m we obtain ei gj fi hj ek gl fk hl 1 0 0 1 since evaluation at any other element of the poset makes all equations trivial this identity along with the redundant one obtained from 2 c d is the only necessary condition therefore the space of interleavings between a b and c d v a b c d is gl 2 k the variety of invertible 2 2 matrices in particular many interleavings between a b and c d are as far from diagonal as possible 32 by choosing a point in each variety separately we obtain an interleaving between i and m note that although we produced many interleavings we did not classify the interleavings between i and m this is clear as we passed from our original to a pair of separate in terleavings on a partition of each barcode in the next example we compute the full variety of interleavings between two elements of c example 11 let p be again be the 2 vee p m x 3 m y 6 let a b be a weight and set 2 a m y 1 y 2 y 3 y 4 y 5 a c m y 5 m y 1 y 2 y 3 a c m y 3 m y 1 a 2 c 2 m y 1 y 1 y 2 y 3 y 4 y 5 b d y 1 y 5 y 1 y 2 y 3 b d y 1 y 3 y 1 b 2 d 2 y 1 let i a b and m c d and let 2 a we will calculatev i m the variety corresponding to all interleavings between i and m see proposition 37 first consider an arbitrary such interleaving of course as always this yields the standard commutative trian gles since m m there exist no non zero morphisms from a into any module not containing the minimal m moreover m supp if and only if m supp hence using our standard notation it must be the case that ad and c b are identically zeros then as matrices of module homomorphisms we have ac b c 0 bd ac b c 0 bd and ca d a 0 db ca d a 0 db since and constitute a interleaving we obtain equations 4 and 5 below 2 i 2 a b 2 a 0 0 2 b a a 2 b a 2 0 b b 2 4 2 m 2 c d 2 c 0 0 2 d c c 2 d c 2 0 d d 2 5 evaluating 4 we see that 2 i m 1 0 0 0 2 i y 1 1 0 0 1 and 2 i x 0 0 0 0 for x 6 m y 1 from the evaluation at y 1 we get the restrictions 1 1 0 the last of which only appears because b a 2 6 0 when evaluating atm we obtain the redundant constraint 1 since every homomorphism in 4 has support contained in m y 1 so there are no further restrictions from 4 by inspection evaluating 5 obtains no new conditions since 0 0 therefore v i m is the affine variety with coordinate ring k modulo the ideal 1 1 33 thus the interleavings are parametrized by two elements of k and one element of k we point out that in both examples 10 and 11 there were additional degrees of freedom for interleavings not seen when one passes to a matching in example 12 we realize the interleaving distance as the minimum height of a translation with non empty variety example 12 let p be the 1 vee p m x 3 and let a b be a weight with a b consider the convex modules m y 1 y 2 a m y 2 m m m y 1 b m y 1 we will calculate the variety v i m for various choices of translations we will use these cal culations to point out the interleaving distance as in remark 4 whatever translations we consider we always set ab a b and ba b a first let 0 the identity translation we can see that there is no 0 0 interleaving between a and b since 2 a 6 0 but hom b a 0 the variety of 0 0 interleavings therefore must be the empty variety we recover this via the equation 2 a q r 0 a b using the notation of proposition 37 which has no solution say when evaluated at m thus for 0 the variety v i m is empty as required now say a since a b a is the next largest maximal translations then a b and b c moreover hom a b hom b a k the space of interleavings are defined by the equations 2 a q r b a 2 a b 2 b r q 0 a b 2 b a note that the variable is absent from r since hom a b 2 0 the first equation yields 1 by evaluating at m and the second equation is consistent and trivially satisfied since 2 b 0 therefore the space of a a interleavings corresponds to the affine variety with coordinate ringk modulo the ideal 1 this corresponds to a choice of one parameter ink also since a corresponds to the first non zero variety we can see that d a b a now suppose that 2 a then a c and b 0 also hom a b 0 and hom b a k the space of interleavings are defined by the equations 2 a q r 0 0 b a 2 a b 2 b r q 0 a b 2 b a 34 since 2 a 2 b are both identically zero any value of satisfies the above equations therefore in this case v a b corresponds to the affine variety with coordinate ring k of course this corresponds to a choice of one parameter in k on the other hand when l for l 3 a a b 0 in this case the only interleaving between a and b is 0 that is to say tfor such translations v a b is the 0 variety putting it all together we obtain the curve below with values in the category of affine varieties only the jump discontinuities are labeled in a slight abuse of notation we write the coordinate rings instead of their corresponding varieties 0 a a 2 a 2 a 3 a 3 a k k 1 k k 0 0 d a b remark 5 in mm 17 we investigate the non democratic choice of weights on a finite totally ordered set here we will show that from the perspective of topological data analysis both poten tial problems associated with discretizing one dimensional persistence modules can be overcome moreover we recover the classical interleaving distance as a limit of discrete distances in fu ture work we will study the geometric formulation of interleaving distances see remark 4 and example 12 references
