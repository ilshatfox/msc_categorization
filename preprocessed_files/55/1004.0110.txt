and philipp spru ssel abstract this paper is the last part of a comprehensive survey of a newly emerging field a topological approach to the study of locally finite graphs that crucially incorporates their ends topological arcs and circles which may pass through ends assume the role played in finite graphs by paths and cycles the first two parts of the survey together provide a suitable entry point to this field for new readers they are available in combined form from the arxiv 2 the topological approach indicated above has made it possible to ex tend to locally finite graphs many classical theorems of finite graph theory that do not extend verbatim while the first part 3 of this survey intro duces the theory as such and the second part 4 is devoted to those appli cations this third part looks at the theory from an algebraic topological point of view the results surveyed here include both a combinatorial description of the fundamental group of a locally finite graph with ends and the homology aspects of this space 1 introduction the survey 2 describes a topological framework in which many well known theorems about finite graphs that appear to fail for infinite graphs do have a natural infinite analogue it has been realised in recent years that many such theorems especially about paths and cycles work in a slightly richer setting not in the locally finite graph g itself but in its compactification g obtained by adding its ends 1 in this setting the traditional cycle space of a graph is replaced by its topological cycle space the topological cycle space c c g of a locally finite graph g is based on the edge sets of topological circles in g homeomorphic images of the unit circle s 1 allowing infinite sums as long as they are thin that is every edge appears in only finitely many summands since the topological cycle space c g was introduced 5 6 it has proved surprisingly successful see 2 4 for numerous applications given the success of c for graphs it seems desirable to recast its definition in homological terms that make no reference to the one dimensional character of g e g to circles to obtain a homology theory for similar but more general spaces such as non compact cw complexes of any dimension that implements the ideas and advantages of c more generally this approach has been pursued 1 for a formal definition of g see 2 1 http arxiv org abs 1004 0110 v 2 in 7 9 8 in this paper we present its main ideas results and examples for simplicity all our coefficients will be taken from f 2 for such an extendable translation of our combinatorial definition of c into algebraic terms simplicial homology is easily seen not to be the right approach while g is not a simplicial complex the simplicial homology of g itself without ends yields the classical cycle space cfin one way of extending simplicial homology to more general spaces is c ech homology and indeed we will show that its first group applied to g is isomorphic to c but there the usefulness of c ech homology for graphs ends since its groups are constructed as limits rather than directly from chains and cycles they do not interact with the combinatorial structure of g in the way we expect and know it from c the next candidate for the desired description of c in terms of homology is singular homology indeed c is built from circles in g and circles are singular 1 cycles that generate the first singular homology group h 1 g of g so both groups are built from similar elements on the face of it it is not clear whether c might in fact be isomorphic even canonically to h 1 g however it will turn out that it is not in 9 we prove that c is always a natural quotient of h 1 g and this quotient is proper unless g is essentially finite this may seem surprising since c is defined via thin infinite sums while all sums in the definition of h 1 g are finite which suggests that c might be larger than h 1 g our approach for the comparison of c and h 1 g will be to define a homo morphism from z 1 g to the edge space e that counts how often the edges of g are traversed by the simplices of a 1 cycle z and maps z to the set of those edges that are traversed an odd number of times it will turn out that this homomorphism vanishes on boundaries and that its image is precisely c hence it defines an epimorphism f h 1 g c g however we will show that f is not normally injective indeed there will be loops that traverse every edge evenly often even equally often in either direction but which can be shown not with some effort to be null homologous thus c is a genuinely new object also from a topological point of view for our proof that those loops are not null homologous we shall need a better understanding of the fundamental group of g this will enable us to define an invariant on 1 chains in g that can distinguish certain 1 cycles from boundaries of singular 2 chains hence completing the proof that f need not be injective the fundamental group of a finite graph g is easy to describe it is the free group on the oriented chords of a spanning tree of g the edges of g that are not edges of the spanning tree for the freudenthal compactification of infinite graphs the situation is different since a loop in g can traverse infinitely many chords while the elements of a free group are always finite sums of its generators one of the main aims of this project therefore became to develop a combi natorial description of the fundamental group of the space g for an arbitrary connected locally finite graph g in 7 we describe 1 g as for finite g in terms of reduced words in the oriented chords of a spanning tree however when g is infinite this does not work with arbitrary spanning trees but only with topological spanning trees moreover we will have to allow infinite words of any countable order type and likewise allow the reduction sequences cancelling ad jacent inverse letters to have arbitrary countable order type however these reductions can also be described in terms of word reductions in the free groups fi on all the finite subsets i of chords which enables us to embed the group 2 f of infinite reduced words as a subgroup in the inverse limit of those fi and handle it in this form on the other hand mapping a loop in g to the sequence of chords it traverses and then reducing that sequence or word turns out to be well defined on homotopy classes and hence defines an embedding of 1 g as a subgroup in f having proved that c is usually a proper quotient of h 1 g the last aim of this project then was to define a variant of singular homology that works in more general spaces and which for graphs captures precisely c first steps in this direction were taken in 9 it was completed in 8 our hope with this translation was to stimulate further work in two directions one is that its new topological guise should make the cycle space accessible to topological methods that might generate some windfall for the study of graphs and conversely that as the approach that gave rise to c is made accessible for more general spaces in particular for cw complexes of higher dimensions its proven usefulness for graphs might find some more general topological analogues the key to the definition of c and to its success is that it treats ends differently from other points to preserve this feature our new homology theory is constructed for locally compact hausdorff spaces x with a fixed hausdorff compactification x in which the compacification points play the role of ends 2 c ech homology the c ech homology of a space is an alternative to singular homology for spaces that are not simplicial complexes for a general spacex the nth c ech homology group h n x is the inverse limit of the homology groups of simplicial complexes induced by open covers of x 2 in the case of x g one can compute the groups h n x more directly to do so fix a normal spanning tree t of g with root r say and denote the subtree of t induced by the first i levels by ti let gi be the finite graph obtained from g by contracting each component of g ti then h n x is the inverse limit of the family hn gi i n since c g is the inverse limit of the groups h 1 gi we have theorem 2 1 9 for a locally finite graph g we have a canonical isomor phism h 1 g c g theorem 2 1 shows that one can describe the topological cycle space in terms of the c ech homology however although h 1 g is isomorphic to c g as a group it does not sufficiently reflect the combinatorial properties of c g its interaction with the combinatorial structure of g to make this precise note that a number of classical results about the cycle space say which circuits generate it as do the non separating chordless circuits in a 3 connected graph say in the c ech homology however it is not possible to decide whether a given homology class in h 1 g corresponds to a circuit indeed the obvious relation between h 1 g and the combinatorial structure of g is that every homology class c h 1 g corresponds to a family cn of homology classes in the groups h 1 gn one might think that the class c should correspond to a circuit in g if and only if every cn with sufficiently large n corresponds to a circuit in gn but this is not the case the limit of a sequence of cycle space elements in 2 see 9 for a formal definition 3 the gn can be a circuit even if the elements of the sequence are not circuits in the gn r tt r cc figure 1 the graph g drawn twice with a normal spanning tree t and a circuit c let g be the graph shown in figure 1 g consists of a wide ladder with three poles x 11 x 1 2 x 2 1 x 2 2 and x 3 1 x 3 2 and has attached infinitely many oridinary ladders by identifying the first rung of the nth ladder ln with the edge x 12 n 1 x 1 2 n it is not hard to prove that t from figure 1 is a normal spanning tree of g with root r x 11 r v t 4 v 4 0 c 4 c 4 g 4 r v t 10 c 10 c 10 v 10 0 v 10 1 g 10 figure 2 the edge sets c 4 in g 4 and c 10 in g 10 the edge set c from figure 1 is a circuit but each edge set cn it induces on a contracted graph gn with n 6 k 4 is not a circuit figure 2 indeed each g 6 k 4 consists of g v t 6 k 4 for each i with 1 i k a vertex v 6 k 4 i corre sponding to a contracted tail of the ladder li and a vertex v 6 k 4 0 corresponding to the contracted tail of the wide ladder and all ladders lj with j k the edge set c 6 k 4 is not a circuit since it has degree 4 at v 6 k 4 0 therefore c is a circuit although it is the limit of the non circuits c 6 k 4 one can easily manipulate the example so that no cn with n large enough is a circuit by attaching copies h 1 h 5 of g to g by connecting the vertices of the first rung of the wide ladder in hi to some suitable vertices of li 4 3 singular homology a more subtle approach than c ech homology which has been pursued in 9 is to see to what extent c g can be captured by the singular homology of g after all c g was defined via the edge sets of circles in g which are just injective singular loops can we extend this correspondence between injective loops and circuits to one between h 1 g singular and c g there are two things to notice about h 1 g the first is that we can subdivide a 1 simplex or concatenate two 1 simplices into one by the inverse procedure by adding a boundary indeed if 0 1 g is a path in g from x to y say and z is a point on that path there are paths from x to z and from z to y such that is the boundary of a singular 2 simplex squeezed on to the image of the second fact to notice is that inverse paths cancel in pairs if is an x y path in g and an y x path with the same image as then 0 h 1 3 these two facts together imply that every homology class in h 1 is represented by a single loop given any 1 cycle we first add pairs of inverse paths between the endpoints of its simplices to make its image connected in the right way and then use euler s theorem to concatenate the 1 simplices of the resulting chain into a single loop moreover we may assume that this loop is based at a vertex to establish the desired correspondence betweenh 1 g and c g we would like to assign to a homology class in h 1 g represented by a single loop an edge set f c g intuitively we do this by counting for each edge e of g how often traverses it entirely which since the domain of is compact is a finite number of times and let f be the set of those edges e for which this number is odd using the usual tools of homology theory one can make this precise in such a way that f is clearly a well defined homomorphism h 1 g e g 4 and whose image is easily seen to be c g what is not clear at once is whether f is 1 1 and onto surprisingly f is indeed surjective and this is not even hard to show in deed let an edge set d c g be given our task is to find a loop that traverses every edge in d an odd number of times and every other edge of g an even number of times as a first approximation we let 0 be a path that traverses every edge of some fixed normal spanning tree of g exactly twice once in each direction see 2 sec 3 3 for how to construct such a loop moreover we construct 0 in such a way that it pauses at every vertex v more precisely so that 10 v is a union of finitely many closed intervals at least one of which is non trivial next we write d as a thin sum d i ci of circuits such a representation of d exists by definition of c g for each of these ci we pick a vertex vi ci noting that no vertex of g gets picked infinitely often because it has only finitely many incident edges and the ci form a thin family finally we turn 0 into the desired loop by expanding the pause at each vertex v to a loop going once round every ci with v vi it is not hard to show that is con tinuous 9 and clearly it traverses every edge of g the desired number of times 3 to see that this sum is a boundary subtract the constant 1 simplex with value x there is an obvious singular 2 simplex of which is the boundary subtracting is allowed since too is a boundary of the constant 2 simplex with value x 4 for each edge e let fe g s 1 be a map wrapping e once round s 1 and mapping all of g e to one point of s 1 let denote the group isomorphism h 1 s 1 f 2 given h h 1 g let f h e fe h 1 f 2 see 9 for details 5 equally surprisingly perhaps f is usually not injective see below in summary therefore the topological cycle space c g of g is related to the first singular homology group of g as follows theorem 3 1 9 the map f h 1 g e g is a group homomorphism onto c g which has a non trivial kernel if and only if g contains infinitely many finite circuits an example of a non null homologous loop in g whose homology class maps to the empty edge set c g is easy to describe let g be the one way infinite ladder l with its end on the right and define a loop in l as follows we start at time 0 at the top left vertex v 0 say and begin by going round the first square of g in a clockwise direction this takes us back to v 0 we then move along the horizontal edge incident with v 0 to its right neighbour v 1 from here we go round the second square in a clockwise direction back to v 1 and on to its right neighbour v 2 we repeat this move until we reach the end of g on the right say at time 1 2 0 1 so far we have traversed the first vertical edge and every bottom horizontal edge once in the direction towards v 0 every other vertical edge twice once in each direction and every top horizontal edge twice in the direction towards the end from there we now use the remaining half of our time to go round the infinite circle formed by the first vertical edge and all the horizontal edges one and a half times in such a way that we end at time 1 back at v 0 and have traversed every edge of l equally often in each direction clearly f maps the homology class of this loop to 0 c l v 0 v 1 v 2 v 3 v 4 figure 3 the loop is not null homologous but f the loop is indeed not null homologous 9 but it seems non trivial to show this to see why this is hard let us compare to a loop winding round a finite ladder in a similar fashion traversing every edge once in each direction such a loop is still not null homotopic but it is null homologous to see this we subdivide it into single edges we find a finite collection of 1 simplices i four for every edge on the topp and two for every other edge such that i i and every i just traverses its edge next we pair up these i into cancelling pairs if i and j traverse the same edge e in opposite directions then i j 0 hence i i 0 as claimed but we cannot imitate this proof for and the infinite ladder because homology classes in h 1 g are still finite chains we cannot add infinitely many boundaries to subdivide infinitely often as it happened the proof of the seemingly simple fact that is not null homologous took a detour via the solution of a much more fundamental problem the problem of understanding the fundamental group of l or more generally of g for a locally finite graph g in order to distinguish from boundaries we looked for a numerical invariant of 1 chains that was non zero on but both linear and additive so that 1 2 1 2 1 2 for concatenations of 1 simplices 1 2 and invariant under homotopies so that 6 1 2 when 1 2 then given a 2 simplex with boundary 1 2 we would have 1 2 0 so would vanish on all boundaries but not on we did not quite find such an invariant but a collection of similar invariants which together can distinguish loops like from boundaries 4 the fundamental group of g in this section we will sketch the combinatorial description of 1 g given in 7 our description involves infinite words and their reductions in a continuous setting and embedding the group they form as a subgroup of a limit of finitely generated free groups let g be a locally finite connected graph fixed throughout this section and let t be a topological spanning tree of g when g is finite then 1 g 1 g is the free group f on the set e 0 en of chords of any fixed span ning tree the standard description of f is given in terms of reduced words of those oriented chords where reduction is performed by cancelling adjacent inverse pairs of letters such as ei ei or ei ei the map assigning to a path in g the sequence of oriented chords it traverses defines the canonical group isomorphism between 1 g and f in particular reducing the words obtained from homotopic paths yields the same reduced word our description of 1 g when g is infinite is similar in spirit but more complex we start not with an arbitrary spanning tree but with a topological spanning tree of g then every path in g defines as its trace an infinite word in the oriented chords of that tree as before however these words can have any countable order type and it is no longer clear how to define the reduction of words in a way that captures homotopy of paths consider the following example let g be the infinite ladder with a topo logical spanning tree t consisting of one side of the ladder all its rungs and its unique end figure 4 the path running along the bottom side of the ladder and back is a null homotopic loop since it traces the chords e 0 e 1 all the way to and then returns the same way the infinite word e 0 e 1 e 1 e 0 should reduce to the empty word but it contains no cancelling pair of letters such as ei ei or ei ei t e 0 e 1 figure 4 the infinite ladder and its topological spanning tree t bold edges this simple example suggests that some transfinite equivalent of cancelling pairs of letters such as cancelling inverse pairs of infinite sequences of letters might lead to a suitable notion of reduction however in graphs with infinitely many ends one can have null homotopic loops whose trace of chords contains no cancelling pair of subsequences whatsoever example 4 1 we construct a locally finite graph g and a null homotopic loop in g whose trace of chords contains no cancelling pair of subsequences of any order type 7 let t be the binary tree with root r like in 2 pp 30 31 we can construct a loop in t that traverses every edge of t once in each direction see figure 5 figure 5 a loop running twice through each edge of the binary tree the loop is easily seen to be null homotopic it is also easy to check that no sequence of passes of through the edges of t is followed immediately by the inverse of this sequence the edges of t are not chords of a topological spanning tree but this can be achieved by changing the graph just double every edge 5 the new edges together with all vertices and ends then form a topological spanning tree in the resulting graph g whose chords are the original edges of our tree t and is still a null homotopic loop in g example 4 1 shows that there is no hope of capturing homotopies of loops in terms of word reduction defined recursively by cancelling pairs of inverse adjacent subwords finite or infinite we shall therefore define the reduction of infinite words differently though only slightly we shall still cancel inverse letters in pairs even only one at a time and these reduction steps will be ordered linearly rather unlike the simultaneous dissolution of all the chords by the homotopy in the example however the reduction steps will not be well ordered this definition of reduction is less straightforward but it has an important property as for finite g it will be purely combinatorial in terms of letters their inverses and their linear order making no reference to the interpretation of those letters as chords and their relative positions under the topology of g another problem however is more serious since the reduction steps are not well ordered it will be difficult to handle reductions e g to prove that every word reduces to a unique reduced word or that word reduction captures the homotopy of loops i e that traces of homotopic loops can always be reduced to the same word the key to solving these problems will lie in the observation that the property of being reduced can be characterized in terms of all the finite subwords of a given word we shall formalize this observation by way of an embedding of our group f of infinite words in the inverse limit f of the free groups on the finite subsets of letters 5 and subdivide the new edges once in case you prefer to obtain a simple graph instead of a graph with multiple edges 8 a word is a map w s a e 0 e 1 e 0 e 1 the letter ei being the inverse of ei where s is a totally ordered countable set the set of positions of the letters used by w and every letter has only finitely many preimages in s a reduction of a word w is a totally ordered set r of disjoint pairs of positions of w such that the positions in each pair are mapped to inverse letters and are adjacent in the word obtained from w by deleting all positions of letters contained in earlier pairs in r we say that w reduces to the word w s r if w has no nonempty reduction we call it reduced note that neither the set s of positions of a word w nor a reduction of w have to be well ordered it was shown in 7 that every word w reduces to a unique word r w 6 and hence the reduced words form a group f it was also shown that f embeds canonically in the inverse limit of the groups fn the free groups on the sets e 0 en on the other hand the fundamental group of g embeds in f mapping a homotopy class to the word r w where w is the trace of the word induced by the passes of through the chords of t with their natural order given by turns out to be well defined in other words the traces of homotopic loops reduce to the same word the harder part is to show the converse that two loops are homotopic whenever their traces reduce to the same word in 7 it was shown that the homotopy can even be chosen so that it contracts pairs of passes one at a time like known from finite graphs the map 7 r w is not normally surjective for example e 0 e 1 will always be a reduced word but no loop in g can pass through these chords in precisely this order if they do not converge to an end hence if there is a non converging sequence of chords which is the case whenever there are two ends of g with no contractible neighbourhood in g then the reduced word e 0 e 1 lies outside the image of our map 7 r w in order to describe the image of this map precisely let us call a word w s a monotonic if there is an enumeration s 0 s 1 of s such that either s 0 s 1 or s 0 s 1 let us say that w converges if the sequence of chords corresponding to its sequence w s 0 w s 1 of letters converges if w is the trace of a loop in g then by the continuity of this path all the monotonic subwords of w and hence those of r w converge it was shown in 7 that the converse is also true a reduced word is the trace of a loop in g if and only if all its monotonic subwords converge we can now summarize our combinatorial description of 1 g as follows theorem 4 2 7 let g be a locally finite connected graph let t be a topo logical spanning tree of g and let e 0 e 1 be its chords i the map 7 r w is an injective homomorphism from 1 g to the group f of reduced finite or infinite words in e 0 e 1 e 0 e 1 its image consists of those reduced words whose monotonic subwords all converge in g 6 unique as an abstract word not as a restiction of w the word e 0 e 0 e 0 for example reduces to e 0 but this letter can have the first or the last position in the original word 9 ii the homomorphisms w 7 r w i from f to fi embed f as a subgroup in lim fi it consists of those elements of lim fi whose projections r w i use each letter only boundedly often the bound may depend on the letter theorem 4 2 provides an interesting interaction between the topological cy cle space of g and the fundamental group of g it is a well known fact that the first singular homology group of a space is the abelianization of its fun damental group for graphs this yields that the classical cycle space of g is the abelianization of 1 g theorem 4 2 implies an analoguous result for the topological cycle space it is the strong abelianization of 1 g 11 theorem 6 19 the quotient of 1 g obtained by factoring out all words in which every letter appears as often as its inverse 5 an ad hoc homology for locally compact spaces in this section we take up the thread of defining c g in terms of homology we have seen that c ech homology although its first group is isomorphic to the topological cycle space fails to properly reflect its relation to the combinatorial structure of g for this reason we shall keep at our singular approach to define c in terms of homology since by theorem 3 1 standard singular homology is not the right theory to capture c we shall define a singular type homology that does so as advertised in section 1 we shall define our homology for locally compact hausdorff spaces with a fixed hausdorff compactification recall that these properties are needed to reflect the properties of g and g that are fundamental for the success of c therefore this class of spaces is the broadest for which we can hope to obtain a homology theory with similar properties as c note that this class includes for instance all locally finite cw complexes of any dimension loops like the one in figure 3 suggest that our homology should allow to subdivide a 1 simplex infinitely often then every 1 chain in g will be ho mologous to the sum of its passes through edges of g and hence it will be null homologous if and only if it lies in the kernel of f the idea is thus to de fine the homology so that we obtain essentially the same 1 cycles as in standard singular homology but more boundaries the construction of c is based on the idea to consider not only the graph itself but also its ends nevertheless although ends do not play a different role in the definition of c than points in g elements of c do behave differently at ends indeed elements of c are thin sums of circuits and as g is locally finite these circuits are also thin at vertices i e every vertex lies in only finitely many of the closures of the circuits in the family this does not have to be the case for ends an end can lie in the closures of infinitely many circuits even when the circuits form a thin family this suggests to require a similar property from the chains in our homology they will have to be locally finite in g but not at ends 7 this will enable us to subdivide paths in g infinitely often but the required locally finiteness in g will keep us from obtaining undesired cycles such as the edges of a double ray 7 the formal definition of locally finite will be given shortly 10 all directed the same way which has zero boundary but does not correspond to an element of the cycle space in the ad hoc homology we shall define in this section we will rule out such cycles by imposing an additional condition on cycles this will lead to the desired result in dimension 1 i e our first homology group will be c but generate problems elsewhere more precisely this homology will fail to satisfy the eilenberg steenrod axioms for homology which is caused precisely by this restriction on cycles in 8 we thus change our approach slightly instead of restricting the group of cycles we define chains differently so as to obtain 1 cycles that are essentially finite and 2 cycles that allow us to subdivide 1 simplices infinitely often this homology theory then satisfies the axioms 8 on the other hand the proof that this homology theory specializes in dimension 1 to yield c relies on the corresponding result for the ad hoc homology defined in this section moreover it introduces some of the main ideas from 8 in a technically simpler setting let x be a locally compact hausdorff space and let x be a hausdorff com pactification of x see e g 1 for more on such spaces note that every locally compact hausdorff space is tychonoff and thus has a hausdorff com pactification although we do not make any assumptions on the type of the compactification apart from being hausdorff we will call the points in x x ends even if they are not ends in the usual more restrictive sense let us call a family i i i of singular n simplices in x admissible if i i i i is locally finite in x that is every x x has a neighbourhood in x that meets the image of i for only finitely many i ii every i maps the 0 faces of n to x note that as x is locally compact i is equivalent to asking that every compact subspace of x meets the image of i for only finitely many i condition ii like i underscores that ends are not treated on a par with the points in x we allow them to occur on infinitely many i which i forbids for points of x but not in the fundamental role of images of 0 faces all simplices must be rooted in x when i i i is an admissible family of n simplices any formal lin ear combination i i i i with all i z is an n sum in x 8 we regard n sums i i i i and j j j j as equivalent if for every n simplex we have i i i i j j j j note that these sums are well defined since an n simplex can occur only finitely many times in an admissible family we write cn x for the group of n chains the equivalence classes of n sums the ele ments of an n chain are its representations clearly every n chain c has a unique representation whose simplices are pairwise distinct which we call the reduced representation of c but we shall consider other representations too the sub group of cn x consisting of those n chains that have a finite representation is denoted by c n x the boundary operators n cn cn 1 are defined by extending linearly from n i which are defined as usual in singular homology note that n is well defined i e that it preserves the required local finiteness and n 1 n 0 chains in im will be called boundaries 8 in standard singular homology one does not usually distinguish between formal sums and chains it will become apparent soon why we have to make this distinction 11 as n cycles we do not take the entire kernel of n rather we define z n x ker n c n x and let zn x be the set of those n chains that are sums of such finite cycles zn x cn x j j zj with zj z n x j j more precisely an n chain cn x shall lie in zn x if it has a representation i i i i for which i admits a partition into finite sets ij j j such that for every j j the n chain zj c n x represented by i ij i i lies in z n x any such representation of as a formal sum will be called a standard representation of as a cycle 9 we call the elements of zn x the n cycles of x the chains in bn x im n 1 then form a subgroup of zn x by defi nition they can be written as j j jzj where each zj is the finite boundary of a singular n 1 simplex we therefore have homology groups hn x zn x bn x as usual note that if x is compact then all admissible families and hence all chains are finite so the homology defined above coincides with the usual singular ho mology the characteristic feature of this homology is that while infinite cycles are allowed they are always of finite character in any standard representation of an infinite cycle every finite subchain is contained in a larger finite subchain that is already a cycle let us look at an example which might indicate whether we obtain the desired cycles in order to capture the topological cycle space consider the double ladder this is the 2 ended graph g with vertices vn and v n for all integers n and with edges en from vn to vn 1 edges e n from v n to v n 1 and edges fn from vn to v n the 1 simplices corresponding to these edges oriented in their natural directions are en e n and fn see figure 6 v 1 v 0 v 1 v 1 v 0 v 1 f 1 f 0 f 1 e 2 e 1 e 2 e 1 figure 6 the 1 chains and in the double ladder in order to let the elements of our homology be defined let g be any haus dorff compactification of g one could for instance choose the freudenthal compactification g of g for the infinite chains and represented by en and e n respectively and for we have 0 and neither sum as written above contains a finite cycle however we can rewrite 9 since the i need not be distinct has many representations by formal sums not all of these need admit a partition as indicated an example will be given later in the section 12 as zn with finite cycles zn en fn 1 e n fn this shows that z 1 g although this was not visible from its original representation by contrast one can show that z 1 g if g is the freudenthal compact ification of g this is proved in 9 but is not obvious for example one might try to represent as n 1 z n with z n e n n 1 en n where n 0 1 e n en maps 0 to v n and 1 to vn 1 see figure 7 e 1 e 0 0 e 1 1 z 1 e 2 e 2 2 z 2 v 2 v 1 v 0 v 1 v 2 v 3 figure 7 finite cycles summing to by an inadmissible sum this representation of however although well defined as a formal sum since every simplex occurs at most twice is not a legal 1 sum because its family of simplices is not locally finite and hence not admissible the point v 0 for instance lies in every simplex i this homology indeed captures the cycle space 9 to see this note that since infinite chains are allowed we can add infinitely many boundaries to a loop like in figure 3 so as to subdivide it into its edge passes note that the family of boundaries we add has to be locally finite and it is not obvious that this can always be satisfied see 9 for how to choose the boundaries therefore two chains are homologous if both of them traverse each edge of g the same number of times together with the fact that the homomorphism f from the first singular homology group h 1 g to c g can be extended to a homomorphism h 1 g c g 9 this implies that h 1 g and c g are isomorphic theorem 5 1 9 if g is a locally finite graph and g g then h 1 g is canonically isomorhic to c g note that it does not suffice to require the chains to be locally finite withour any further assumptions as it is the case for the locally finite homology defined in 10 this homology does not capture the cycle space indeed applied to g it yields the usual singular homology since every locally finite chain in a compact space is finite on the other hand applied to g the locally finite homology allows for chains like above which do not correspond to an element of the cycle space as mentioned before the ad hoc homology defined above does not satisfy the eilenberg steenrod axioms for homology for an example as well as a listing of the axioms see 8 this is caused by the fact that the cycles are not chosen to be the entire kernel of but with the additional property that they are a locally finite sum of finite cycles for this reason we develop in 8 a homology that does satisfy the axioms and that is defined without further assumptions on the cycles like before we define this homology for locally compact hausdorff spaces x with a fixed hausdorff compactification x for this homology to capture c g we have to allow infinite chains since chains like the chain consisting of the loop in 13 figure 3 have to be null homologous in our homology as they correspond to the empty edge set in g but are not the boundary of a finite chain on the other hand we cannot allow all locally finite chains as this would yield the locally finite homology mentioned above the solution to this dilemma is surprisingly simple we allow only those simplices to appear infinitely often in a chain that are needed to subdivide a path or more generally a simplex this will enable us to subdivide simplices into their edge passes and the isomorphism between our new homology and c g will follow like for the ad hoc homology above a main feature of the simplices whose boundaries we need to subdivide a path is that they are in a sense one dimensional they can be written as the composition of a map 2 1 and 10 this leads us to the following definition call a singular n simplex in x degenerate if there is a compact hausdorff space x of topological dimension less than n such that can be written as the composition of continuous maps n x x we would now like to say that we only allow chains that have a represen tation with all but finitely many simplices degenerate this would not be a proper definition of chain since the boundary of a chain would not have to be a chain in this case this can easily be remedied call a chain good if it has the above property we now allow all n chains that are the sum of a good n chain and the boundary of a good n 1 chain this homology turns out to satisfy all the eilenberg steenrod axioms 8 and the fact that all 2 simplices in the one dimensional space g are degenerate implies that we indeed obtain the right boundaries hence theorem 5 2 8 if g is a locally finite graph and g g then the first group h 1 g of the new homology is canonically isomorphic to c g references 1 h abels and p strantzalos proper
