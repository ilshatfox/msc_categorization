lemma about their fixed points when g is a p group and then use this lemma to compute the fixed points of the steinberg summand of the equivariant classifying space of z p n these results will be used in a companion paper to study the layers in the mod p symmetric power filtration for hfp 1 introduction this brief paper establishes two results regarding steinberg summands of equivariant spectra namely let g be a finite p group and let gln gln fp then 1 theorem 13 for any pointed g gln space y there is a natural homotopy equiv alence en y g eny g from the steinberg summand of the fixed points to the fixed points of the steinberg summand 2 theorem 17 let bg z p n denote the equivariant classifying space of z p n let c denote the set of normal subgroups h g such that g h is an elementary abelian p group then the fixed points of the steinberg summand en bg z p decomposes into a wedge sum of spectra en bg z p n g h c en h if g h is elementary abelian of rank d then the summand en h is en h en db z p n d 1 d b d b z p d along the way we gather certain results about non equivariant steinberg summands that are scattered in the literature we also prove a result relating steinberg summands and stiefel varieties vd f n p proposition 18 which is an important step in the proof of proposition 21 1 http arxiv org abs 1903 08246 v 1 this paper is a companion to a larger work 4 in which the layers in the mod p symmetric power filtration are calculated with a view to understanding hfp hfp in the larger paper we observe that the genuine g spectrum hfp is the infinite mod p symmetric power of the equivariant sphere spectrum gs 0 and the layers of the filtration gs 0 sp 1 z p gs 0 sp p z p gs 0 sp p 2 z p gs 0 sp z p gs 0 hfp are the n fold suspensions of the steinberg summands enbg z p n 2 steinberg summands in this section we construct steinberg summands and prove some of their basic properties the results of this section are not original work of the author but they are scattered throughout the literature so we collect and prove the results important to us in subsection 2 1 we define the steinberg idempotent and steinberg representation in subsection 2 2 we define product maps relating these idempotents the steinberg summand in topology does not appear until subsection 2 3 there we give its definition definition 8 in terms of the flag complex several properties of the flag complex are proven which will later be useful to us 2 1 the steinberg idempotent the content of this subsection is well known the reader may refer to 2 5 or 3 fix a prime p and let fp denote the field of p elements let n be a positive integer and write gln gln fp for brevity denote by rn the group algebra z p gln tensor products will be taken over z p unless otherwise specified let n gln be the subgroup of permutation matrices and let bn gln be the borel subgroup of upper triangular matrices associated to these two subgroups are elements n bn in the group algebra rn defined by n n 1 bn b bn b lemma 2 of 5 states that nbn nbn cn nbn where cn is the constant cn n i 1 pi 1 the number cn is invertible in z p and therefore the element en 1 cn nbn is an idempotent in the group algebra rn 2 definition 1 the element en 1 cn nbn is called the steinberg idempotent for any left rn module m there is the z p submodule enm enm m m m which is called the steinberg summand of m taking the steinberg summand is a functor from left rn modules to z p modules note that rn is both a left rn module and a right rn module therefore rnen is a left rn submodule of rn definition 2 the left rn module rnen is denoted by stn and is called the steinberg module there is an isomorphism of z p modules enm stn m gln the steinberg module has dimension p n 2 over z p this fact is a direct corollary of proposi tions 7 and 8 proven in a later section definition 3 the element e n 1 cn bn n is called the conjugate steinberg idempotent for any left rn module m the z p submodule e nm is called the conjugate steinberg summand of m the following two maps are inverse isomorphisms enm e nm e nm enm nbnm 7 bn nbnm bn nm 7 nbn nm because composing then in either order induces multiplication by the unit cn z p therefore enm and e nm are isomorphic as z p modules 2 2 products on steinberg summands let i and j be positive integers the block inclusion gli glj gli j a b 7 a 0 0 b gives a map ri rj ri j we denote by ei ej the image under this map of the idempotent ei ej of ri rj the idempotent ei ej has the following relation to the idempotent ei j 3 let ui j denote the group of i j i j matrices of the form ii 0 ij let shuf i j denote the set of i j i permutations with the property that 1 a b i a b and i 1 a b i j a b such permutations are known as i j shuffle permutations define u i j u ui j u shuf i j shuf i j 1 then the following identities can be checked u i j bi bj bi bj u i j bi j shuf i j i j i j shuf i j i j u i j i j i j u i j therefore shuf i j u i j ei ej ci j cicj ei j 2 1 definition 4 there is a homomorphism of left z p gli glj modules sti z p stj z p gli glj ei ej z p gli j ei j sti j a ei ej 7 a shuf i j u i j ei ej we refer to the map above as the steinberg product the steinberg product represents the following projection of summands which is functorial in the ri j module m ei ej m ei jm x 7 shuf i j u i jx the following two properties can be checked associativity the following diagram commutes ei ej ek m ei j ek m ei ej k m ei j km 4 commutativity let i j be the shuffle permutation that increases every number by j modulo i j then ei ej 1 ej ei and therefore we have inverse isomorphisms ei ej m ej ei m and 1 ej ei m ei ej m the following diagram commutes ei ej m ej ei m 1 ei ej m ww ei jm for any fixed n one should think of the various idempotents ei 1 eik i 1 ik n as functors from the category of left rn modules to the category of z p modules the steinberg product defines natural transformations among these functors starting from the initial functor e 1 e 1 and going to the final functor en proposition 5 let f ei jm ei ej m be the z p linear map f ei jm cicj ci j ei ej ei jm then the composition of f with the steinberg product as shown is the identity map ei jm f ei ej m ei jm proof this proposition is a direct result of equation 2 1 and the fact that e 2 i j ei j 2 3 the flag complex for any pointed space x let x s 1 x denote the reduced suspension of x suppose that x is a pointed topological space with gln action in this section we construct a spectrum enx in a way that mirrors the algebra of the previous section there is a splitting in the homotopy category of p local spectra x enx 1 en x where denotes the wedge sum the reason we must pass to spectra is because our construc tion involves desuspending spaces fix a positive integer n and let fnp denote a fixed n dimensional vector space over the field fp let bn denote the nerve of the poset of subspaces of f n p that do not equal 0 or f n p this poset and therefore the associated nerve bn carries a left action of gln the following properties are well known but are proved for the sake of completeness all supporting proofs are deferred to the end of this section proposition 6 the space bn has the homotopy type of a wedge of p n 2 spheres of dimension n 2 5 proposition 7 there is an isomorphism of z p gln modules hn 2 bn z p stn as constructed bn is not a pointed space let b n denote the unreduced suspension of bn the space b n is the geometric realization of a simplicial set where the k simplices are flags w 0 wk with the property that either w 0 0 or wk f n p but not both 0 l 0 l 1 l 2 l 3 f 23 for example let p 3 there are four one dimensional subspaces of f 23 which we denote by l 0 l 1 l 2 and l 3 pictured to the left is the topological space b 2 as a pointed space it is homotopy equivalent to 3 s 1 the blue points alone are b 2 which is homotopy equiv alent to 3 s 0 then b n is a pointed space with the 0 simplex 0 as the basepoint its z p homology is as follows h b n z p stn n 1 0 6 n 1 if we smash the space b n by the negative sphere s n 1 we obtain the spectrum 1 nb n whose homology is concentrated in degree 0 the spectrum 1 nb n should be thought of as a topological analogue to the steinberg module definition 8 let x be a spectrum with gln action then the steinberg summand of x denoted enx is defined as enx 1 n b n x gln egln when y is any pointed space or spectrum with gln action we henceforth use yhgln to denote the homotopy orbit space yhgln y gln egln as an example let us compute the mod homology of enx and show that it is equal to the steinberg summand of the rn module h x z p the hochschild serre spectral sequence associated to the fiber sequence 1 nb n x 1 n b n x hgln bgln 6 has e 2 page e 2 i j hi bgln hj 1 n b n x z p hi j 1 n b n x hgln z p the homology group h 0 1 n b n z p stn is a projective rn module and therefore flat it follows by the k nneth formula that hj 1 n b n x z p stn z p hj x z p provided that hj x z p is finite dimensional over z p the rn module stn z p hj x z p is projective and so it has no higher gln homology thus our e 2 page is h 0 bgln stn z p h x z p stn z p gln h x z p which is by definition the steinberg summand enh x z p the e 2 page is concentrated on a single vertical line and therefore the spectral sequence collapses this argument is functorial in the pointed space x and therefore implies the following commutative diagram of functors here glnsp denotes the category of spectra of finite type with na ve gln action and grmodrn denotes the category of graded left rn modules glnsp en h z p sp h z p grmodrn en grmodz p as defined we have no reason to believe the promise that enx is a summand of x proposition 9 below implies that there are natural transformations of endofunctors on the category glnsp en id id en such that the composition en id en is multiplication by a unit in z p therefore if we define the spectrum 1 en x as the homotopy fiber 1 en x hofib x enx then the cofiber sequence 1 en x x enx splits as promised proposition 9 there are maps 1 nb n gln gln 1 n b n such that the composition 1 nb n gln 1 n b n is multiplication by a unit in z p 7 there are product maps as well for any finite dimensional fp vector space v let bv denote the nerve of the poset of subspaces of v which do not equal 0 or v if dim v n then bv bn let b v denote the nerve of the poset of subspaces of v including 0 and v itself the space b v is contractible because the poset of subspaces of v has an initial element 0 there is an obvious inclusion of simplicial sets b v b v if v v v then there is a product map b v b v b v w w 7 w w when the above map is restricted to either b v b v or b v b v it lands in the subspace b v therefore the product above restricts b v b v b v b v b v b v b v but since b v and b v are both contractible the union above is homotopy equivalent to the unreduced join b v b v we have constructed a product on flag complexes namely b v b v b v if we choose isomorphisms v fip and v fjp and the isomorphism v v v is given by block inclusion then it is easily checked when we take the top homology of the above product on flag complexes we recover the product sti stj sti j on steinberg modules proposition 10 let v be a finite dimensional fp vector space and let w be a subspace let pw gl v denote the parabolic subgroup of matrices preserving w let sw denote the pw set sw w v w w v and w w 0 then the pw equivariant product map b w w sw b w b v is a homotopy equivalence of pointed spaces the wedge sum shown is taken over all subspaces w complementary to w i e such that w w v and w w 0 as promised here are the proofs of propositions 7 through 10 proposition 7 the space bn has the homotopy type of a wedge of p n 2 spheres of dimension n 2 note an alternate proof is given as 1 theorem 6 8 5 8 proof we use induction on n the case n 1 is obvious suppose that n 2 let h fnp be a subspace of dimension n 1 and let p bn be the nerve of the poset of subspaces which intersect h nontrivially the space p is contractible because it has a self map w 7 h w which is homotopic to both the constant map at h and to the identity map therefore bn bn p note that any subspace of f n p of dimension 2 or greater automatically intersects h nontrivially and so the only simplices which remain in bn p are those flags whose bottom space is a line transverse to h thus bn p decomposes as a wedge sum bn p l h bn l bn l where bn l resp bn l denotes the nerve of the poset of subspaces containing l resp strictly containing l the space bn l is contractible and bn l bn 1 thus bn p l h bn 1 the induction is now complete by the observation that there are p n 1 lines transverse to h proposition 8 the top homology group hn 2 bn z p with its left gln action is the stein berg module stn proof the group of simplicial chains cn 2 bn is the free z module over the set of maximal flags which is z gln bn z gln bn let m gln be a matrix and let its columns be denoted by v 1 vn then consider the following linear combination of maximal flags sm n 1 v 1 v 1 v 2 in the module z gln bn the chain sm is equal to m nbn we claim that sm is a cycle namely sm 0 let w 1 wn be any permutation of v 1 vn then any n 3 simplex of the form w 1 wi 1 w 1 wi 1 is on the boundary of exactly the following two different k 2 simplices w 1 wi 1 w 1 wi 1 wi w 1 wi 1 w 1 wi 1 w 1 wi 1 wi 1 w 1 wi 1 and this implies that sm 0 we next claim that the set sm m gln spans hn 2 bn this will prove the claim that hn 2 bn stn fix a complete flag f f 1 fn 1 suppose that w 1 wn 1 is a complete flag which is transverse to f i e wi fn i 0 for i 1 n 1 for each i 1 n wi fn i 1 is 1 dimensional and so we may pick a sequence of nonzero vectors w 1 wn so that wi wi fn i 1 the wi s have two important properties observe that wi fn i 1 and therefore wi wi 1 thus by induction on i w 1 wi wi for i 1 2 n 1 and w 1 wk f n p 9 suppose that n is a permutation such that i j where j i then wj fn j 1 wj fn i and because w i wj we have w 1 w i fn i 6 0 thus for any nontrivial permutation n the flag w 1 w 1 w 2 is not transverse to f let m be the matrix whose columns are w 1 wn the two properties above imply that sm w 1 wn 1 6 id 1 non f transverse flags it follows that the dimension of the span of the set sm m glkn is at least as large as the number of complete flags transverse to f which is p n 2 this is the dimension of the entire space hn 2 bn so the two are equal as desired proposition 9 there are maps 1 nb n gln gln 1 n b n such that the composition 1 nb n gln 1 n b n is multiplication by a unit in z p proof for ease of notation let us write b b n in this proof b is a cw complex whose i cells correspond to flags of proper subspaces v 1 vi b has a skeletal filtration b 0 b 1 b n 1 b where b i contains the cells of dimension i and lower then b n 1 b n 2 is a wedge of n 1 spheres with a single sphere for every maximal flag thus b b n 1 b n 1 b n 2 gln bn s n 1 one may now compose with the stable transfer map gln bn gln to obtain the map b gln s n 1 on homology this composite has the effect of sending sm h n 1 b to m nbn h n 1 gln s n 1 now we construct the map gln s n 1 b consider the composition gln s n 1 n gln s n 1 gln bn s n 1 b n 1 b n 2 for any matrix a glk the homology class of gln s n 1 defined by a maps under the above composition to the class sa which is a cycle therefore there is a lift to b n 1 b n 1 gln s n 1 0 t q nbn b n 1 b n 2 b n 2 10 the map above sends a matrix a h n 1 gln s n 1 to a nbn h n 1 b n 1 b n 2 which lifts to the homology class sa h n 1 b therefore the composite of the two maps we have constructed has the following effect in homology h n 1 b h n 1 gln s n 1 h n 1 b n 1 b n 2 sa 7 a nbn 7 a nbn nbn since nbn nbn cn nbn and cn z p the proposition has been proved proposition 10 let v be a finite dimensional fp vector space and let w be a subspace let pw gl v denote the parabolic subgroup of matrices preserving w let sw denote the pw set sw w v w w v and w w 0 then the pw equivariant product map b w w sw b w b v is a homotopy equivalence of pointed spaces the wedge sum shown is taken over all subspaces w complementary to w i e such that w w v and w w 0 proof let v have dimension n both b w w w b w and b v have underlying space equivalent to a wedge of copies of sn so it suffices to prove that the map is an equivalence on n th homology groups without loss of generality assume v fnp and w f i p is spanned by the first i basis vectors the pw set of subspaces w which are transverse to w is equivalent to pw gli gln i this set has size p i n i and so by proposition 7 dim hn b w w w b w p i 2 i n i n i 2 p n 2 dim hn b v so by dimension reasons it suffices to show that the given map is a surjection on homology recall that for any j the top z p homology group of b j is z p glj jbj therefore by the kunneth formula hn b w w w b w ind pw gli gln i f p gli gln i i n i bi bn i z p pw i n i bi bn i the map is given by the inclusion pw gln therefore in order to show that the map z p pw i n i bi bn i z p gln nbn is surjective it is sufficient to show that any invertible n n matrix can be written in the form a b where a b bn and n this can be shown easily by row reduction 11 3 fixed points of a steinberg summand the steinberg summand construction definition 2 3 may be carried into the equivariant setting first we must define the g equivariant analogue of homotopy orbits definition 11 if is any finite group then eg denotes the g space whose fixed points under any subgroup g are eg if 1 if 6 1 and bg is the quotient g space eg note that the g equivariant classifying spaces bg fit into a theory of equivariant principal bundles definition 12 let g be a finite group and let x be a spectrum with g gln action the steinberg summand enx is the na ve g spectrum enx 1 n b n x gln eggln it follows from proposition 9 that the na ve g spectrum x contains enx as a summand taking g fixed points of the g space eg yields the space e thus we have an inclusion of spaces e eg g eg this inclusion produces for every subgroup h g a natural transformation from the composite functor en h to the composite functor en h topg gln h en topgln en rz na ve g spectra h spectra in this section we prove that the natural transformation above is a homotopy equivalence when g is a p group that is we prove the following theorem theorem 13 let g be a p group and let h g be any subgroup let y be any pointed g gln space the inclusion of fixed points egln eggln g eggln induces a map b n y h gln egln b n y gln eggln h if g is a p group then the map above is an equivalence it immediately follows that the map en y h eny h is an equivalence of spectra 12 to prove this theorem we must first establish a formula equation 3 1 for the fixed points of the equivariant homotopy orbits of a space definition 14 let g and be any finite groups and let h g be a subgroup for any homomorphism f h its graph is the subgroup of h f h f h h h the group acts on the set hom h by conjugation on the target for a homomorphism f h let c imf denote the centralizer of the image of f note that if f f hom h are conjugate homomorphisms then the centralizers c imf and c imf are conjugate subgroups notice that if f f hom h are two different homomorphisms then the subgroup of h generated by f f is no longer a graph homomorphisms it follows that eg f eg f for any g space x we therefore obtain the following formula for the h fixed points of x eg x eg h f hom h x f eg f f hom h x f e f hom h x f hc imf 3 1 the map e eg g eg of spaces yields an inclusion map xh e x e h x eg h under the decomposition of equation 3 1 the space xh e is the summand corresponding to the zero homomorphism h proof of theorem 13 the fixed point space b n y gln eggln h decomposes as a wedge sum b n y gln eggln h hom h gln gln b n imf y f cgln imf we must prove that for every nontrivial homomorphism f up to conjugacy the summand b n imf y f cgln imf is contractible it is sufficient to prove that the pointed cgln imf space b n imf is equivariantly contractible this will follow from a proof that the unpointed cgln imf space bn imf is equivariantly contractible which follows from lemma 15 below the map of spectra en y h eny h is the n 1 th desuspension of the inclusion b n y gln egln h b n y gln eggln h and is therefore an equivalence 13 lemma 15 let v be a finite dimensional vector space over a finite field f of positive char acteristic p let u gl v be a nontrivial unipotent subgroup i e order a power of p the fixed point space bv u carries a residual action of the normalizer of u which we denote by ngl v u then bv u is ngl v u equivariantly contractible proof the action of the group u on the f vector space v extends linearly to an action of the group ring f u let i denote the augmentation ideal of f u defined by generators i u 1 u u let v v be the subspace annihilated by i because u contains at least one non identity matrix it must be that v 6 v the subspace v is preserved by the action of ngl v u we claim that v 6 0 to prove this it suffices to show that there is some k 0 such that ik annihilates v in the case where u is a maximal unipotent subgroup of gl v the ideal idim v annihilates v and therefore for any unipotent subgroup u ik annihilates v for some k dim v let w v be a nonzero subspace that is preserved by u because u is unipotent w has a vector w such that uw w for every u u this is equivalent to saying that iw 0 and so it follows that the intersection w v is nonzero thus there is a well defined ngl v u equivariant poset map f bv u bv u w 7 v w for every subgroup ngl v u the map f restricts to a map of fixed point spaces f bv u bv u because v w w the map f is homotopic to the identity map because v w v the map f is homotopic to the constant map at v therefore the fixed point space bv u is contractible for every ngl v u which completes the proof 4 fixed points in equivariant classifying spaces let g be a p group the goal of this section is to compute the g fixed points of the stein berg summand of bg z p n to state the result of this computation we must make a few definitions definition 16 let c denote the set of normal sugroups heg such that g h is an elementary abelian p group it is easily seen that the set c is closed under intersections and thus c has a minimal element as a poset c is isomorphic to the poset of sub fp vector spaces of g f for each subgroup h c let d h denote the rank of g h as an fp vector space 14 theorem 17 there is a decomposition of spectra enbg z p n g h c en h for spectra en h which are given by the formula en h en d h b z p n d h 1 d h b d h b g h if h and k are subgroups such that d h k d h d k then the equivalence above respects the product structures on both sides the spectra en h are defined in definition 20 along with their product structure the equivalence en h en d h b z p n d h 1 d h b d h b g h is proposition 21 4 1 the mod p stiefel variety let n and d be nonnegative integers let vd f n p denote the set of n d matrices with entries in the field fp and with nullspace zero then vd f n p is a finite set with an action of the group gln fp it is a mod p analogue of the stiefel manifold vd r n of orthonormal d frames in euclidean n space note that there is an inclusion of glm gln sets vc f m p vd f n p vc d f m n p given by block inclusion of matrices let f be a functor from the category of finite dimensional mod p vector spaces with isomorphisms to the category top of pointed spaces such that for any finite dimensional mod p vector spaces v and w there is an equivalence f v w f v f w of gl v gl w spaces there is an equivalence f 0 s 0 for every integer n 0 the pointed space f fnp carries an action of the group gln fp one may then consider its steinberg summand enf f n p 1 n b n f f n p hgln which is a spectrum these spectra are related by product maps ekf f k p e f f p ek f f k p which are built using the product 1 kb k 1 b 1 k b k and the block inclusion glk gl glk in this section we will prove the following lemma which relates the mod p stiefel variety vd f n p to steinberg summands 15 lemma 18 let f be a functor as above let n d be nonnegative integers such that n d then there is an equivalence of spectra 1 db d f f d p en df f n d p en vd f n p f f n p denote the spectrum on the left by a n d and the spectrum on the right by b n d there are obvious product maps a n d a m c a m n c d and b n d b m c b m n c d then the equivalence above respects these product maps proof let ed f n p denote the subgroup spanned by the first d coordinates and let en d f n p denote the subgroup spanned by the last n d coordinates let b d b ed and b n d b en d let gl ed gl en d gl f n p ed gln denote the subgroups of matrices gl ed gld 0 0 in d gl en d id 0 0 gln d gl fnp ed id 0 gln d then gl fnp ed is the subgroup of matrices which act by the identity on ed let s denote the set of subspaces w fnp of dimension n d such that w ed we have the following two observations 1 as a gl fnp ed torsor s gl f n p ed gl en d 2 as a gln torsor vd f n p gln gl f n p ed therefore 1 db d f f d p en df f n d p 1 db d f ed 1 n d b n d f en d hgl en d by definition 1 db d f ed w s 1 n db w f w hgl fnp ed by 1 above 1 nb n f f n p hgl fnp ed by proposition 10 1 nb n vd f n p f f n p hgln by 2 above the fact that this equivalence respects the product maps is a routine check 4 2 the fixed points of the steinberg summand of an equivariant classifying space let g be a finite p group and let n be a positive integer any homomorphism from g to z p n has kernel contained in c 16 definition 19 for each subgroup h c let hom g z p n h hom g z p n denote the set of homomorphisms with kernel h then hom g z p n h c hom g z p n h a homomorphism from g to z p n with kernel h is the same as a monomorphism from g h to z p n thus the gln torsor hom g z p n h is identified with the mod p stiefel variety vd h f n p see 18 and so hom g z p n h c vd h f n p 4 1 now let us study the steinberg summand of the g fixed points of the equivariant classifying space bg z p n equation 3 1 tells us that en bg z p n g en hom g z p n b z p n h c en hom g z p n h b z p n definition 20 let n be a positive integer and h c be a subgroup of g the spectrum en hom g z p n h b z p n is called the h summand of en bg z p n g we denote it by en h for any two positive integers m n and subgroups h k c there is a product map em h en k em n h k which is determined by the product maps em bg z p m g en bg z p n g em n bg z p m n g let m n be any two positive integers there is an obvious isomorphism of glm gln sets hom g z p m hom g z p n hom g z p m n under the identification of equation 4 1 the isomorphism above yields product maps on the components vd h f m p vd k f n p vd h k f m n p in the situation where d h k d h d k this product is given by block inclusion of matrices for an appropriate choice of basis subgroups h k g which satisfy the property that d h k d h d k are called transverse in 4 17 proposition 21 there is an equivalence of spectra en h en d h b z p n d h 1 d h b d h b g h if n m are two positive integers and h k c are transverse subgroups then under the equiv alence above the product map en h em k en m h k is identified with the product on the right hand term that is built using the following three maps en d h b z p n d h em d k b z p m d k em n d h k b z p m n d h k 1 d h b d h 1 d k b d k 1 d h k b d h k b g h b g k b g h k proof this is immediate from applying lemma 18 with the functor f z p n b z p n references 1 d benson representations and
