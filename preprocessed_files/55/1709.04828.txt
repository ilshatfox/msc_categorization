justin noel and nathaniel stapleton abstract for a finite abelian group a we determine the balmer spectrum of sp a the compact objects in genuine a spectra this generalizes the case a z pz due to balmer and sanders bs 17 by establishing a corrected version of their logp conjecture for abelian groups we also work out the consequences for the chromatic type of fixed points and establish a generalization of kuhn s blue shift theorem for tate constructions kuh 04 contents 1 introduction 1 2 proofs of the main results 5 3 blue shift for lubin tate spectra 8 4 the complexes of arone and lesh 15 references 18 1 introduction extended abstract in bal 05 balmer constructs a topological space spc t called the balmer spectrum of t for any essentially small triangulated category t equipped with a compatible symmetric monoidal structure this theory unifies the general reconstruction theorems for quasi compact quasi separated schemes e g tho 97 bal 02 and the notion of support varieties ap pearing in modular representation theory e g bcr 97 bik 11 moreover the primordial ex amples namely the thick subcategory theorem of hopkins and smith hs 98 for spectra and the analogous result for the derived category of a noetherian commutative ring by hopkins and nee man hop 87 nee 92 fit naturally into this framework in each case the complete description of spc t was a major breakthrough in the respective field as the space spc t captures the global structure of t this paper is concerned with the balmer spectrum of the homotopy category of sp g of compact genuine g spectra lms 86 for a finite group g this category blends topological information such as the stable homotopy groups of spheres with group theoretic information such as burnside rings and group cohomology it has been much studied in recent years especially after its crucial role in the solution of the kervaire invariant one problem hhr 16 building on unpublished work of strickland and joachimi joa 15 balmer and sanders bs 17 determine the underlying set of spc sp g and show that the topology of spc sp g is closely related to the blue shift phenomenon in generalized tate cohomology discovered by greenlees hovey and sadofsky gs 96 hs 96 more precisely they show that determining the topology on spc sp g is equivalent to computing the justin noel was partially supported by the dfg grants no 1175 1 1 and sfb 1085

dnrf 92 1 http arxiv org abs 1709 04828 v 3 2 barthel hausmann naumann nikolaus noel and stapleton blue shift numbers in g defined below in definition 1 2 of g which broadly speaking measure how equivariant homotopy theory interacts with chromatic homotopy theory they are able to deduce these numbers for groups of square free order from the seminal blue shift result of kuhn kuh 04 and propose a conjecture for the general case here we resolve this conjecture for all finite abelian groups a thereby giving a complete description of spc sp a and we deduce geometric consequences for finite complexes with a action see theorem 1 3 in particular this establishes a far reaching generalization and geometric interpretation of kuhn s theorem detailed description of the results we now go through the results of this paper in more detail and recall the key definitions along the way let t 1 be an essentially small triangulated category ver 96 nee 01 the points of the balmer spectrum spc t of t are the prime thick ideals i e those proper thick ideals i t such that if a b i then a i or b i a basis for the open subsets of spc t is given by the complements of subsets of the form supp a p spc t a 6 p for some a t when t is rigid 1 and it will be in all examples below then balmer s classification theorem bal 05 introduction identifies the collection of thick ideals of t with the thomason subsets of spc t i e subsets given by unions of closed subsets with quasi compact complements this shows in particular that the underlying set of spc t determines only the prime thick ideals while the topology of spc t is required to classify all thick ideals of t in bs 17 balmer and sanders study for a finite group g the balmer spectrum spc sp g of the homotopy category sp g of compact genuine g spectra lms 86 we recommend the introduction of bs 17 for a thorough overview of this problem the results depend on the thick subcategory theorem of hopkins and smith hs 98 rav 92 which we will now recall see bal 10 sec 9 for more details 2 for each prime p z and integer n 1 there is a prime thick ideal in the category sp of finite spectra cnp x sp k n 1 x 0 and these constitute a descending chain c 1 p c n p c p n 0 cnp x sp k x 0 here k n denotes the nth morava k theory at the prime p with the usual conventions that k 0 hq independently of p and k hfp finally spc sp is obtained by taking the union over all p of these sets of prime ideals and noting that independently of p each of the prime ideals c 1 p equals the single prime consisting of torsion finite spectra now we return to sp g for each subgroup h of g we have an exact symmetric monoidal geometric fixed point functor h sp g sp which induces a continuous map of balmer spectra h spc sp spc sp g balmer and sanders show that these maps are jointly surjective and that h 1 p h 2 q if and only if h 1 is conjugate to h 2 and p q in spc sp bs 17 thm 4 9 and thm 4 11 this determines spc sp g as a set to complete the identification of the topological space spc sp g and hence 1 the consequence of this technical assumption is that every thick ideal of t is radical see bal 05 rem 4 3 and prop 4 4 2 note that when the tensor unit 1 t generates t as a thick subcategory then every thick subcategory of t is also a thick ideal so there is no distinction between thick ideals and thick subcategories of sp the balmer spectrum of genuine a spectra 3 obtain the classification of the thick ideals one needs to further identify all inclusions between the prime ideals spc sp g p h q n h 1 cnq h g 1 n q prime 3 balmer and sanders reduce this problem to the special case that g is a p group for some prime p and q p bs 17 prop 6 11 they also give an important result in this case bs 17 prop 8 1 cor 8 4 suppose that g is a p group k h are subgroups of g and denote s logp h k then for each n 1 p k p n s p h p n after the other reductions of balmer and sanders the only remaining question is as follows cf bs 17 rem 8 6 question 1 1 let k h be subgroups of a p group g and 1 n what is the minimal 0 i logp h k such that p k p n i p h p n to underline their fundamental importance we give these numerical invariants of finite p groups a proper name definition 1 2 in the situation of question 1 1 let in g h k i and call it the nth blue shift number of g with respect to k h the term blue shift here is motivated by the fact that balmer and sanders link question 1 1 which asks how the chromatic type of the geometric fixed points of a finite g spectrum can vary to a blue shift phenomenon for generalized tate cohomology cf bs 17 section 9 in summary computing for a p group g all of the blue shift numbers in g h k is equivalent to identifying the topological space spc sp g moreover the identification of the balmer spectrum for general finite groups reduces to the case of p groups balmer and sanders conjecture bs 17 logp conjecture 8 7 that their bound is optimal namely that in g h k logp h k in corollary 1 4 we will identify in g h k precisely when g a is an abelian p group our identification agrees with the balmer sanders conjecture when a is an elementary abelian p group and disagrees otherwise we then provide the necessary correction to complete the identification of spc sp a for all abelian groups a to make question 1 1 more concrete recall that hopkins and smith define for a finite p local spectrum y c 0 p sp p type y max n y c n p 0 to be the type of y here we abuse notation and let cnp also denote the p local analogues of the subcategories discussed above using the reduction to the p local case and unwinding the definitions one sees that question 1 1 is concerned with determining how the type of h x varies with respect to a choice of subgroup h g for a finite p local g spectrum x see remark 4 5 for a simple example along these lines we now fix a prime p a finite abelian group a not necessarily a p group and we let denote the set of subgroups of a to every x sp a p we associate the function fx 0 1 defined by fx a type a x this function encodes which prime thick ideals of sp a p the spectrum x belongs to and as we vary x the inclusions among all prime thick ideals finally let us denote by rkp b dimfp b z fp the p rank of a finite abelian group b theorem 1 3 for a function f 0 1 the following are equivalent i there is some x sp a p such that f fx 3 the fact that determining these inclusions is equivalent to knowing the topology follows from the second sentence of bs 17 cor 8 19 4 barthel hausmann naumann nikolaus noel and stapleton ii for every chain of subgroups a a a such that a a is a p group we have f a f a rkp a a this answers question 1 1 for abelian p groups as follows corollary 1 4 when p is a prime a is an abelian p group and k h a are subgroups then in a h k rkp h k for all 1 n we note that as an immediate consequence of corollary 1 4 the blue shift numbers in a h k are independent of n in case a z pz theorem 1 3 is due to balmer and sanders bs 17 sec 7 to prove it they make use of kuhn s seminal blue shift theorem for tate cohomology kuh 04 prop 1 11 we will prove a generalization of kuhn s theorem which also is of interest in its own right we must first fix some notation for a spectrum x sp let a x a x sp be the a geometric fixed points of the borel a equivariant spectrum x associated with x 4 moreover let l f n 1 denote the bousfield localization functor on sp with kernel cnp theorem 1 5 for every abelian p group a and integer n 1 we have x c 0 p a l f n 1 s 0 x 0 cmax n rkp a 0 p outline of the proof of theorem 1 3 we first show that for abelian groups a the blue shift numbers in a a a are determined by the absolute ones in a in a a e proposition 2 4 and proposition 2 5 in terms of the in a the proof of theorem 1 3 has two major ingredients which establish a lower and an upper bound respectively the first ingredient is a far reaching generalization of the blue shift theorem for complex oriented cohomology theories due to greenlees hovey and sadofsky gs 96 hs 96 indeed the natural map from l f n 1 s 0 to a morava e theory spectrum e of height n 1 allows us to obtain an upper bound for in a by considering a e the key idea is then to recognize a e as suitable sections of the structure sheaf on a certain non connective derived scheme this makes it possible to use derived algebraic geometry and the geometry of the stack of formal groups to completely describe the height shifting behaviour of a e as a second ingredient we make use of equivariant finite complexes f n built from partition complexes that feature prominently in the goodwillie calculus of functors in particular we rely on the study of their chromatic behaviour in am 99 aro 98 and on that of their fixed points in al 17 these results imply that the complexes f n realize the stipulated blue shift thereby establishing our lower bound for in a finally we show that our upper and lower bounds for in a coincide and deduce the description of spc sp a since for non abelian groups g one has g e 0 mnn 15 prop 5 26 and there are no suitable non abelian generalizations of the f n known we believe that the determination of the balmer spectrum for any interesting class of finite non abelian groups requires substantial new ideas in fact we are not even able to see that for a general finite group g the number in g is independent of n organization of the paper this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we prove theorem 1 3 and theorem 1 5 postponing the proofs of two key technical results to the following two sections the first technical result is theorem 3 5 in section 3 which determines the blue shift of generalized tate constructions on lubin tate spectra it will be used to establish the implication i ii in 4 for comparison with kuh 04 observe that a x a e a f ea i x are the geometric fixed points of the tate construction of the a spectrum i x where i x is the inflation of x the balmer spectrum of genuine a spectra 5 theorem 1 3 the second one is theorem 4 1 in section 4 and is a guide through previous work of arone lesh dwyer and mahowald which provides examples of finite a complexes with very subtle properties this is the key result needed to show the implication ii i in theorem 1 3 acknowledgments markus hausmann thanks gregory arone for helpful conversations on the subject of this paper niko naumann thanks neil strickland for making unpublished notes of his available we thank paul balmer beren sanders and the anonymous referee for pointing out inac curacies in a preliminary draft of this paper this work first began while tobias barthel thomas nikolaus and nathaniel stapleton were in bonn and they thank the mpim for its hospitality 2 proofs of the main results we first state two key technical results the proofs of which are postponed to section 3 and section 4 respectively theorem 2 1 assume p is a prime a is a finite abelian p group and x sp a p then type a x type 0 x rkp a theorem 2 2 arone dwyer lesh mahowald let p be a prime n 1 and z pz n the corresponding elementary abelian p group then there is a p local finite equivariant spectrum f n sp p satisfying the following conditions i the geometric fixed points f n have type 0 ii the underlying non equivariant spectrum of f n i e 0 f n has type n fix a finite abelian group a and a prime p where a is not required to be a p group now we turn to determining the balmer spectrum of sp a p the localization at p of sp for every subgroup a a and 1 n we have a prime ideal p a n p a p n a 1 cnp x sp a p type a x n spc sp a p 5 writing for the set of subgroups of a even more is true the map 1 spc sp a p a n 7 p a n is bijective bs 17 thms 4 9 and 4 14 determining the topology on spc sp a p is more subtle and is equivalent to deciding for which pairs a n a m 1 we have an inclusion p a n p a m cf bs 17 cor 8 19 our result is as follows theorem 2 3 given subgroups a a a and 1 n m the following are equivalent i we have p a n p a m ii we have a a the quotient a a is a p group and n m rkp a a we will now explain how to use results of bs 17 to reduce the proof of theorem 2 3 to the special case that a a equals 0 a by bs 17 prop 6 9 the inclusion in theorem 2 3 i is possible only if a a and a a is a possibly trivial p group so we assume this from now on in the following we will write pa p when it seems necessary to identify that the ambient group is a we can then state the first reduction step proposition 2 4 for subgroups a a a and 1 m n the following are equivalent 5 since we are now working p locally we will omit the second entry in the notation p a q n from the introduction since q will always be p 6 barthel hausmann naumann nikolaus noel and stapleton i we have pa a n pa a m ii we have pa a n pa a m proof restriction induces a continuous map of spectra res spc sp a p spc sp a p which for all subgroups b a and 1 k satisfies res pa b k pa b k so ii implies i the reverse implication is more subtle and uses the observation bs 17 sec 2 1 f that res satisfies a going up theorem following the notation there choose p pa a n and q pa a m we then have res q pa a m p i e p res q and the going up theorem implies that there is some q q such that res q p since for subgroups of abelian groups res is injective bs 17 cor 4 4 and thm 4 14 and we have res pa a n pa a n p we conclude that q pa a n and the relation q q then means that ii holds replacing a by a we have thus reduced to understanding possible inclusions pa a n pa a m we reduce this problem further with the following proposition proposition 2 5 for a subgroup a a and 1 m n the following are equivalent i we have pa a n pa a m ii we have pa a 0 n pa a a a m proof we use bs 17 2 1 h the adjoint functors a spa spa a inf satisfy a inf id hence the induced maps on spectra exhibit spc sp a a p as a retractive subspace of spc sp a p furthermore by bs 17 prop 4 7 we have spc a pa a 0 n pa a n and spc a pa a a a m pa a m which concludes the proof to summarize for the proof of theorem 2 3 we can assume a a with a a a p group by the discussion immediately following theorem 2 3 we can then assume that a a by proposition 2 4 and that a 0 by proposition 2 5 this now reduces the proof of theorem 2 3 to the following special case theorem 2 6 assume a is a finite abelian p group and 1 m n then the following are equivalent i we have p 0 n p a m ii we have n m rkp a proof let k rkp a we first assume that m n to show that i implies ii we will prove the contrapositive in other words we assume that m n k and then we will show that p 0 n 6 p a m to do this we consider two cases first assume that n k since m n k 1 1 we have p a m p a n k 1 and it suffices to show that p 0 n 6 p a n k 1 i e that there is some x sp a p with type 0 x n and type a x n k our example will achieve equality in both cases to start use theorem 2 2 to choose some y sp z pz n p with type 0 y n and type z pz n y 0 we choose a subgroup z pz k z pz n and consider z the balmer spectrum of genuine a spectra 7 res z pz n z pz k y sp z pz k p it satisfies type 0 z n and the type of z pz n y z pz n z pz k z pz k z is zero since the individual fixed point functors can drop height at most by the rank of the group involved by theorem 2 1 we conclude that type z pz k z n k denoting by x the inflation of z along a a pa z pz k it is now clear that x has the desired properties in the case n k it suffices to check that p 0 k 6 p a m i e that there exits x sp a p with type 0 x k and type a x m 1 the existence of such a spectrum follows again from theorem 2 2 since k is the p rank of a and hence we can even find some x sp a p with type 0 x k and type a x 0 to see that ii implies i we need to see that if x sp a p satisfies type 0 x n m k then type a x m this is precisely the content of theorem 2 1 the remaining cases with m n reduce to showing that p 0 p a which follows from the above as in bs 17 cor 7 2 proof of theorem 1 3 to see that i implies ii take subgroups a a a such that a a is a p group say of p rank k and also fix some x sp a p we wish to show that f a type a x type a x k f a k restricting to a we can assume that a a and using that in this case a a a a we can further reduce to a 0 in this case the desired conclusion is theorem 2 1 to see that ii implies i consider the following subset spc sp a p z p a n a a n f a where in the above expression we use the convention this subset is closed by our assumption ii on the function f and theorem 2 3 indeed if p a n z and p b l p a n i e p b l p a n then l n rkp a b f a rkp a b f b hence p b l z the open complement of z is quasi compact by bs 17 prop 10 1 by bal 05 prop 2 14 there is some x sp a p with supp x z it is clear that this x has the desired properties proof of theorem 1 5 fix an integer n 1 set k rkp a and recall we wish to prove that x c 0 p a l f n 1 s 0 x 0 cmax n rkp a 0 p to show the inclusion we can assume that n k 1 for otherwise the claim is trivial take x c 0 p with a l f n 1 s 0 x since there is a ring map l f n 1 s 0 e for a lubin tate theory e at p of height n 1 we see that a e x as well since the chromatic height of a e is n 1 k remark 3 6 ii we have x cn kp by lemma 3 7 iii to see the inclusion by the thick subcategory theorem it is sufficient to find a single example of some x c max n k 0 p such that a l f n 1 s 0 x as in the proof of theorem 2 6 we see that there is some y sp a p such that type a y max n k 0 and such that type 0 y max n k we then have l f n 1 s 0 y and hence l f n 1 s 0 y l f n 1 s 0 y which implies a l f n 1 s 0 a y 8 barthel hausmann naumann nikolaus noel and stapleton and x a y is as desired 3 blue shift for lubin tate spectra the aim of this subsection is to compute the blue shift on lubin tate spectra of f geometric fixed points for general families f in abelian groups see theorem 3 5 below there are many similar and overlapping results in the literature and while we will not try to be exhaustive here we mention at least the following sources gs 96 consider the tate cohomology of vn periodic complex oriented spectra hs 96 consider the bousfield classes of the tate cohomology of the ln localizations of finite spectra str 12 considers elementary abelian p groups and an alternative tate construction ams 98 consider the z pz tate construction on johnson wilson spectra and hkr 00 provide crucial results on the lubin tate cohomology of finite groups which we will use below fix a prime p an integer n 1 and a lubin tate spectrum e of height n at the prime p see rez 97 lur 10 for general background we denote by ln le the corresponding bousfield localization functor cf rav 92 ch 7 this localization only depends on n and the implicit prime p and not on our choice of lubin tate spectrum e definition 3 1 the chromatic height of an e e algebra e r 6 0 is ht r min t 0 r ltr remark 3 2 since e lne we have 0 ht r n by analyzing chromatic fracture squares cf ghmr 05 eq 0 1 one sees that ht r t is equivalent to k i r 0 for i t and k t r 6 0 by hah 16 thm 1 1 the former condition follows from only knowing k t 1 r 0 so we see that ht r max t 0 k t r 6 0 fix a finite abelian p group a definition 3 3 i for a proper family f of subgroups of a we call corkp f min rkp a a a such that a 6 f the p corank of f ii for a family f of subgroups of a there are a spaces ef and e f the latter of which is pointed which are characterized up to an essentially unique equivariant weak equivalence by their fixed point data 3 4 efk if k f otherwise e fk if k f s 0 otherwise iii in ii when f 0 is the family only containing the trivial subgroup it is customary to write ea ef and e a e f iv for a spectrum x sp let x spa denote the borel completion of x that is the unique a spectrum which is borel complete and whose underlying spectrum is x with trivial a action cf mnn 17 sec 6 3 v for a family f of subgroups of a and x spa we call f x e f x a the balmer spectrum of genuine a spectra 9 the f geometric fixed points of x as special cases 0 x ta x is the classical tate construction as in gm 95 c and for the family p of proper subgroups of a a x p x are the usual a geometric fixed points the following is the main result of this section theorem 3 5 let p be a prime a a finite abelian p group n 1 an integer e a lubin tate spectrum at p of height n and f a family of subgroups of a then f e 0 if and only if corkp f n 1 otherwise the chromatic height of the e e algebra f e is given by ht f e ht e corkp f n corkp f remark 3 6 i in the language of mnn 15 the vanishing criterion in theorem 3 5 for f e is equivalent to the determination of the derived defect base of e since e f e is a ring spectrum its a fixed points i e f e vanish if and only if it is itself equivariantly contractible i e e f e 0 by definition this is equivalent to f containing the derived defect base of e which consists of those subgroups of a of p rank at most n by mnn 15 prop 5 36 theorem 3 5 extends that result by further identifying how the chromatic height varies for all families of subgroups of a ii for the family p of proper subgroups of a non trivial finite abelian group a the p corank corkp p rkp a is the p rank of a hence the chromatic height of the geometric fixed points a e p e of e drops by the p rank of a after taking into account gm 95 b prop 3 20 this case was implicitly studied in sta 13 p 1015 iii if f is taken to be the family of subgroups of p rank at mostm rkp a then the chromatic height drops by corkp f m 1 in particular every height drop between 0 and rkp a can be realized by a suitable f geometric fixed points functor the proof of theorem 3 5 will be through a series of lemmas we first record a folklore result lemma 3 7 below relating the height of e e algebras with the geometry of lubin tate space cf dfhh 14 ch 12 lem 8 1 2 to formulate it we need to fix some notation first choose a map of e 1 algebras mu p e and denote by vi 2 pi 1 e i 0 v 0 p the images of the araki generators of the same name under this map we can arrange that vn is a unit which admits a root vn u 1 pn n hence un is of degree 2 and we then have ui viu pi 1 n 0 e 0 i n 1 the deformation theory of formal groups implies that e w k u 1 un 1 u 1 n and that the u 0 un 1 determine the height filtration of the formal part of the universal p divisible group g over spec 0 e for every 0 t n 1 we denote by it 1 u 0 ut 0 e the ideal which cuts out the locus of height at least t 1 we also set in 1 1 recall lur 11 def 8 5 thm 8 42 that a non connective spectral dm stack can be thought of as a pair x x ox consisting of a classical deligne mumford stack x ox lmb 00 and a hyper complete sheaf ox of e rings on the e tale site of x such that 0 ox ox and such that the ox module i ox is quasi coherent for all i z every e ring r canonically determines a non connective spectral dm stack spe t r spec 0 r ospe t r cf lur 17 1 4 2 6 lemma 3 7 assume that 6 x x ox f spe t e is a non connective spectral dm stack and 0 t n is an integer then the following are equivalent 6 the construction of ospe t r will partially be recalled during the proof of lemma 3 16 below 10 barthel hausmann naumann nikolaus noel and stapleton i the sheaf of e rings ox is lt local i e for every e tale open u x the e ring ox u is lt local ii the map of underlying spaces lur 17 1 5 4 determined by f namely f x spe t e spec 0 e factors through the open subscheme spec 0 e v it 1 i e the locus of height at most t iii for every finite p local spectrum f of type greater than t we have ox f 0 in particular the chromatic height of the global sections x ox is given by 3 8 ht x ox max ht g for x a geometric point where ht g for denotes the height of the formal part of the base change of g to along the composition x spec 0 e proof we show the equivalence between i and iii first if r is an lt local ring spectrum and f is a finite p local spectrum of type t then r f lt r f r lt f 0 since lt is smashing applying this with r ox u shows that i implies iii conversely iii implies that for every t we have r t 0 and thus 0 k r t k r k k t since k t 6 0 and k is a graded field we deduce that k r 0 applying this to the relevant chromatic fracture squares we see that lk r lt r for all k t since ox is a sheaf of ln local ring spectra this implies r ln r lt r and hence that i holds to establish the equivalence between the first two conditions we first observe that both i and ii are e tale local on x for i this is just the sheaf condition for ox together with the fact that any limit of lt local spectra is lt local for ii this follows more directly because the underlying map of any e tale cover is surjective we can thus assume that x spe t r for some e e algebra e r 6 0 to settle this special case we will freely use the notation and results of gm 95 a specifically we have lt r r i 1 t 1 e i 1 t 1 e r and there is a fiber sequence of e modules k it 1 e e i 1 t 1 this shows that i is equivalent to k it 1 e r 0 direct inspection of the construction of k it 1 shows that k it 1 e r k it 1 r and that k it 1 r 0 is equivalent to it 1 r r which is equivalent to ii finally the formula for ht x ox in equation 3 8 follows because for every 0 t n condition ii can be checked on geometric points remark 3 9 in the above proof we used the well known implication t x 0 k x 0 valid for any spectrum x the reverse implication is the telescope conjecture now believed by many to be false one can however establish the reverse implication for up to homotopy ring spectra using the nilpotence theorem of hs 98 recall that we fixed a finite abelian p group a a family f of its subgroups and a lubin tate spectrum e of height n at p to apply lemma 3 7 to determine the chromatic height of the e e algebra f e we review the modular interpretation of the e e algebra e ba we will show in particular that all f e occur as suitable local sections of its structure sheaf so we study in some detail the affine spectral scheme spe t eba corresponding to the e ring e ba the first step is to recall the determination of the classical commutative ring 0 e ba in algebro geometric terms the commutative ring 0 e carries a one dimensional formal group f which is a universal deformation of its special fiber the system g f pk k 0 of p power torsion constitutes the balmer spectrum of genuine a spectra 11 a p divisible group over 0 e 7 we denote by a the pontryagin dual of a choosing n so large that pna 0 we consider the functor hom a g pn on 0 e algebras valued in abelian groups which sends every r to the group of homomorphisms from a to g pn r proposition 3 10 there is an isomorphism of finite flat group schemes of rank a n over 0 e spec 0 e ba hom a g pn proof the isomorphism is hkr 00 prop 5 12 the computation of the rank is immediate cf str 97 sec 7 remark 3 11 i the above can be rephrased by saying that spe t eba is an even periodic enhancement of the composition hom a g pn spec 0 e mfg in the sense of mm 15 def 2 5 ii for cyclic a proposition 3 10 admits an interesting generalization from the case of ba k a 1 to considering k a m for arbitrary m 1 instead see hl 13 thm 3 4 1 we next consider the principal open subschemes of hom a g pn determined by euler classes we fix a coordinate t bs 1 e for the formal group f g for and for every character a s 1 refer to the composition e ba b bs 1 t e 0 e ba as the euler class of the principal open subscheme determined by is u e spec 0 e ba e 1 spec 0 e ba hom a g pn observe that there is a closed immersion hom ker g pn hom a g pn determined by pullback along the surjective restriction of characters a ker the following proposition 3 12 is a basic observation after translating between affine schemes and algebra the proof is just as in gm 95 b prop 3 20 we denote by ohom a g pn the structure sheaf of the affine derived scheme spe t 0 e ba taking the result of proposition 3 10 as an identification in the following proposition 3 12 in the above situation we have i an equality u e hom a g pn hom ker g pn of open subschemes of hom a g pn and ii an identification of eba algebras u e ohom a g pn ker e where ker a a a ker denotes the family of subgroups of a on which vanishes 7 more is true this is part of an equivalence between p divisible commutative formal lie groups over 0 e and connected p divisible groups over 0 e tat 67 prop 1 12 barthel hausmann naumann nikolaus noel and stapleton proof to prove i we observe there is an obvious cartesian square hom ker g pn hom a g pn 0 hom im g pn the zero section of hom im g pn is given by the vanishing of the euler class e im s 1 because im is cyclic of p power order and the naturally of e implies that the closed immersion hom ker g pn hom a g pn is given by the vanishing of e for the proof of ii we will need a bit more information about e we will abuse notation and let denote the corresponding complex representation applying one point compactification to the inclusion 0 we obtain a map of based a spaces e s 0 s smashing e with e taking a fixed points and using our complex orientation we obtain the eba module map eba eba corresponding to the map e above mnn 15 5 1 now we do have u e ohom a g pn e ba e 1 by the construction of the structure sheaf ohom a g pn to see the claim we will use the equivalence e ker colimns n which can be checked using definition 3 3 ii with transition maps given by multiplication with e using this we see ker e e ker e a colimn ea e ea e ea e 1 eba e 1 u e ohom a g pn we want to generalize proposition 3 12 ii by finding an open subscheme typically non principal of hom a g pn over which the sections are f e for a given family f we also want this open subscheme to have a modular interpretation as in proposition 3 12 i above which will ultimately allow for the height computation of theorem 3 5 we begin by observing that for every family f we have 3 13 f a f a a f a a ker the first equality in 3 13 is trivial and the second one follows from duality of finite abelian groups here we commit a mild abuse of notation by identifying some a a with the composition a a a s 1 the decomposition 3 13 suggests to consider the following open subscheme of hom a g pn 3 14 u f a f a a u e the balmer spectrum of genuine a spectra 13 by proposition 3 12 i this equals 3 15 u f hom a g pn a f a a hom ker g pn this last equation gives us the desired modular interpretation of u f and we can also identify the sections over it as follows lemma 3 16 in the above situation we have u f ohom a g pn f e as algebras over eba hom a g pn ohom a g pn proof for every open u x hom a g pn and e 0 e ba 0 x ox we have a cartesian square u u e ox u ox u e ox u u e ox u ox e 1 given any family f and any character a s 1 we also have a cartesian square of genuine g spectra e f ker e f e ker e f ker e f e ker assume now that u and f are such that u ox f e as eba algebras comparison of the above two cartesian squares with e e and using proposition 3 12 ii then implies that u u e ox f ker e as eba algebras applying this inductively with proposition 3 12 ii as a starting point we see that for every a f we have 3 17 a a u e ox ker e 3 13 a e finally for any two opens u v x we have 3 18 u v ox u ox x ox v ox 14 barthel hausmann naumann nikolaus noel and stapleton and conclude u f ox 3 14 a f a a u e ox 3 18 a f a a u e ox 3 17 a f a e a f a e 3 13 f e for the equivalence we used e f 1 e f 2 e f 1 f 2 which is again easily inferred from definition 3 3 ii now we have assembled everything to prove the main result of this subsection proof of theorem 3 5 taking the identification of lemma 3 16 and applying equation 3 8 with x u f ohom a g pn u f we find that ht f e max ht g for u f a geometric point if is any geometric point of spec 0 e then we have g p n z pnz n ht g for so using 3 15 we obtain the following cumbersome but elementary description of the sought for ht f e it is the largest t 0 such that there is a homomorphism a z pnz n t such that for all a f there is a character a a such that ker a ker 6 ker observe that ker a ker im a a c a a a cyclic so the condition on is that it does not vanish on a a for every a f we now determine which c a can occur as the kernels of such since pna 0 for any subgroup c a there will be an inclusion a c z pnz n t if and only if rkp a c n t now a maximal t satisfying the above is determined by n t min rkp a c c a s t a f a a 6 c using that for any finite abelian p group b we have rkp b rkp b that a 7 a a and c 7 a c a a are mutually inverse inclusion reversing bijections between subgroups of a and a and that f is a family this becomes n t min rkp c c a c 6 f corkp f as claimed we finally use theorem 3 5 to prove theorem 2 1 which shows that the formation of geometric fixed points can lower the type of a finite complex at most by the p rank of the group acting we repeat the statement for convenience the balmer spectrum of genuine a spectra 15 corollary 3 19 assume a is a finite abelian p group and x sp a p then type a x type 0 x rkp a proof let k rkp a and we can assume that n type 0 x k 1 for otherwise our assertion is vacuously true our assumption is that k n 1 0 x 0 in the case n i e 0 x is contractible the following argument is applied for every morava k theory denote by e a lubin tate spectrum at p of height n 1 since type 0 x n 1 and any map into a k n 1 local spectrum factors through the k n 1 localization we have e 0 x 0 then we have more generally e ea a x 0 for all subgroups a a by considering the collapsing homotopy fixed point spectral sequence in other words the borel spec trum f x e is equivariantly contractible because we have f x e a e ea a x 0 equivalently all of the geometric fixed points of this spectrum are contractible we conclude that 0 a f x e d a x a e the second of these equivalences uses the finiteness of x and the fact that a is a symmetric monoidal functor we know that the chromatic height of a e is n k 1 by remark 3 6 ii so its p local finite acyclics are precisely the complexes of type at least n k cf lemma 3 7 iii this means that type a x type d a x n k also in case n 8 4 the complexes of arone and lesh the aim of this subsection is to use work of arone dwyer lesh and mahowald to give a proof of theorem 2 2 the statement of which we repeat for convenience theorem 4 1 arone dwyer lesh mahowald let p be a prime n 1 and z pz n the corresponding elementary abelian p group then there is a p local finite equivariant spectrum f n sp p satisfying the following conditions i the geometric fixed points f n have type 0 ii the underlying non equivariant spectrum of f n i e 0 f n has type n this result is of central importance to the entire paper we remark that the complexes f n are closely related to the complexes constructed by mitchell in mit 85 which were the first examples of finite non equivariant complexes of arbitrary type the exact relation between these two families of complexes is worked out in aro 98 sec 2 the construction of f n uses equivariant homotopy theory for compact lie groups and we refer the reader to mnn 15 for a rapid review of this we first describe the groups involved fix an integer m 1 and let u m denote the unitary group of rank m embed the permutation group m u m as the subgroup of permutation matrices fix the non standard embedding u m 1 u m corresponding to the embedding cm 1 cm as the orthogonal complement of the diagonal note that then m u m 1 u m now consider the case m pn and embed pn using the regular representation of on its underlying set let ppn denote the geometric realization of the poset of non trivial proper partitions of a set with pn elements the equivariant spanier whitehead dual d p pn of its unre duced suspension is canonically an object of sp pn i e a finite genuine pn spectrum and we 8 poincare duality for k n cohomology makes it clear that the types of a finite complex and its dual agree 16 barthel hausmann naumann nikolaus noel and stapleton consider its twist d p pn s by the representation sphere of the reduced regular representa tion of pn we denote by ind u pn 1 pn sp pn spu pn 1 the induction functor and by res u pn 1 spu pn 1 sp the restriction functor note that both induction and restriction preserve finite spectra we can thus finally define f n res u pn 1 ind u pn 1 pn d p pn s p sp p the geometric fixed points of f n will be analyzed through the following result which is essen tially contained in al 17 5 proposition 4 2 we have u 1 pn 1 ind u pn 1 pn as functors sp pn sp proof we will first establish the following unstable refinement of our assertion denote by c cu pn 1 u 1 pn 1 the centralizer of in u pn 1 and note that c for every pn space x we define a map between fixed point spaces 4 3 x c x u pn 1 pn x x c x c x which we claim is an equivalence functorial in x it is immediate that 4 3 is well defined and functorial in x its injectivity results from an easy computation using that pn is its own centralizer if c x c x then there exists some pn such that c x c 1 x u pn 1 x this implies c c c and hence c d 1 c 1 d for all d from this we see that pn c and hence c c 1 for some 1 and x x x as desired to see the surjectivity of 4 3 recall the general computation of the fixed points of an induced space u pn 1 pn x u x u u pn 1 such that u 1 u pn and x x u 1 u denoting by n nu pn 1 pn u u pn 1 u 1 u pn arone and lesh show in al 17 5 that the obvious inclusion c pn n is in fact an equality now given u x u pn 1 pn x we can write u c with c c pn and x x u 1 u x 1 we conclude that x 1 y for some y x and then compute x c y c y c 1 y u x hence x is indeed surjective to identify c we observe that c u 1 p n 1 maps to each of the pn 1 components by each of the non trivial irreducible representations of the quotient of each of these actions is u 1 u 1 im u 1 z pz u 1 we can thus identify the quotient u 1 p n 1 p n 1 u 1 p n 1 to identify the quotient c u 1 p n 1 by the diagonal copy of we consider the induced quotient fiber sequence p n 1 u 1 p n 1 u 1 p n 1 p n 1 u 1 p n 1 this forces u 1 p n 1 to be a k z p n 1 1 u 1 p n 1 the balmer spectrum of genuine a spectra 17 in order to pass to the stable setting we observe that the above equivalence 4 3 has an obvious analogue for pointed pn spaces which implies a natural stable equivalence for pointed pn spaces x of the form 4 4 c x u pn 1 pn x u pn 1 pn x now by the equivariant freudenthal suspension theorem may 96 ix and a standard induction argument over cells every finite pn spectrum y is equivalent to s v x where x is the equivariant suspension spectrum of a finite pointed pn space x and s v is the equivariant spanier whitehead dual of a representation sphere of pn applying the equivalence of 4 4 to such an x we see that c y s v c x s v u pn 1 pn x ind u pn 1 pn y finally every pn spectrum is a filtered colimit of finite pn spectra and hence we obtain the desired equivalence for any pn spectrum taking into account that c u 1 pn 1 proof of theorem 2 2 recall that we defined f n res u pn 1 ind u pn 1 pn d p pn s p sp p and now need to check properties i and ii for f n by proposition 4 2 we see that f n u 1 pn 1 d p pn s p observe that is symmetric monoidal and in particular commutes over spanier whitehead duals since p pn is the tits building of gln fp cf adl 16 lem 10 1 which is a wedge of p n n 1 2 spheres of dimension n 2 if n 2 for n 1 the tits building is empty and its unreduced suspension is s 0 and s s 0 we see that f n has type zero showing property ii requires much harder previous work of arone and mahowald using that 0 ind u pn 1 pn u pn 1 h pn we see that the underlying spectrum of f n is given as 0 f n u pn 1 h pn d p pn s p this is easily recognized to be up to a shift one of the spectra figuring in aro 98 where arone uses kn to denote the suspension of p n in aro 98 thm 0 4 building on work of arone and mahowald am 99 it is shown that h 0 f n fp is finitely generated free and non zero over the subalgebra an 1 of the mod p steenrod algebra using this to compute connective morava k theories through the adams spectral sequence it easily follows that the type of 0 f n is at least n see the proof of mit 85 thm 4 8 for details of this argument since we have already seen that the geometric fixed points of f n have type zero we know that the type of 0 f n can be at most n by theorem 2 1 so it must be exactly n which concludes the proof remark 4 5 the case n 1 of theorem 2 2 admits a nice direct proof which we learned from akhil mathew let f 1 sp z pz denote the cofiber of the transfer map t s 0 z pz s 0 on geometric fixed points this map is zero because it factors through z pz z pz 0 hence 18 barthel hausmann naumann nikolaus noel and stapleton z pz f 1 s 0 s 1 has type zero the non equivariant map underlying t is simply multiplication by p hence 0 f 1 is equivalent to s 0 p and thus has type one references adl 16 gregory arone william g dwyer and kathryn lesh bredon homology of partition complexes doc math 21 1227 1268 2016 al 17 gregory arone and kathryn lesh fixed points
