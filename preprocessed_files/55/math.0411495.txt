manifold modeled on a separa ble infinite dimensional euclidean space e with riemannian metric g given an augmented fredholm filtration f of m by finite dimensional submanifolds mn n k we associate to the triple m g f a non commutative direct limit c algebra a m g f lim a mn that can play the role of the algebra of functions vanishing at infinity on the non locally compact space m the c algebra a e as constructed by higson kasparov trout for their bott periodicity theorem is isomorphic to our construction when m e if m has an oriented spinq structure 1 q then the k theory of this c algebra is the same with dimension shift as the topological k theory of m defined by mukherjea furthermore there is a poincare duality isomorphism of this k theory of m with the compactly supported k homology of m just as in the finite dimensional spin setting 1 introduction infinite dimensional hilbert manifolds have been studied since the 1960 s with main applications in infinite dimensional differential topology global analysis non linear pdes and other areas this paper is concerned with constructing c algebras and computing the k theory for a particular class of infinite dimensional hilbert manifolds namely fredholm manifolds 18 20 21 this is part of a research program to introduce concepts and techniques from alain connes noncommuta tive geometry 11 e g c algebras k theory cyclic co homology and spectral triples into the study of fredholm manifolds but first let us review the finite dimensional case given m a finite dimensional riemannian manifold let c 0 m be the commutative c algebra of all continuous complex valued functions which vanish at infinity on m this c algebra categori cally encodes the topological properties of m 46 and by the serre swan theorem plays a dual role in the k theory of m kj m kj c 0 m j 0 1 where kj m is the reduced topological k theory of m 3 furthermore if m has a spin or spinc structure 33 there is a poincare duality isomorphism 26 43 kn j

dimension of m the other c algebra for a finite dimensional m is non commutative and con structed using the riemannian metric g for each x m the tangent space txm of m is a finite dimensional euclidean space with inner product gx thus we can form the complex clifford algebra cliff txm gx see section 2 it has a canonical structure as a finite dimensional z 2 graded c algebra the family of c algebras cliff txm gx x m naturally forms a z 2 graded c algebra vector bundle cliff tm m called the clifford algebra bundle of m 4 we then can define c m c 0 m cliff tm to be the c algebra of continuous sections of the clifford algebra bundle of m vanishing at infinity this c algebra was used by kasparov 29 in studying the novikov conjecture where he used the notation c m if m is even dimensional and has a spin structure or more generally a spinc structure then this c algebra is morita equivalent to c 0 m in general c m is morita equivalent to c 0 tm by the morita invariance of k theory it follows that kj c m kj c 0 m k j m j 0 1 for m odd dimensional and spin this is more complicated see proposition 5 14 if m is an infinite dimensional hilbert manifold 32 modeled on a separable infinite dimensional euclidean i e real hilbert space e then these two construc tions do not work both fail since compact subsets of m e are thin i e contained in finite dimensional subspaces thus c 0 e 0 since there are no compactly supported continuous functions on e which are non zero however the clifford c algebra has been generalized by higson kasparov trout 25 to the case m e by a direct limit construction that exploits an important property of clif ford algebras with respect to orthogonal sums see equation 2 the component c algebras in the direct limit are given by a ea c 0 r c e a c 0 r c 0 e a cliff ea where denote the z 2 graded tensor product 6 and c 0 r is graded by even and odd functions since the map ea 7 a ea is functorial with respect to inclusions of finite dimensional susbspaces one can construct a non commutative direct limit c algebra in the better notation of 24 a e lim ea e a ea where the direct limit is taken over all finite dimensional subspaces ea e see example 4 3 for more on this construction and how it fits into our theory this c algebra was used to prove an equivariant bott periodicity theorem for infinite dimensional euclidean spaces 25 and has had applications to proving cases of the novikov conjecture and more generally the baum connes conjecture 24 49 now suppose the hilbert manifold m is fibered as the total space of a smooth infinite rank euclidean vector bundle p f x with fiber e and compatible affine connection over a finite dimensional riemannian manifold x let pa f a x be a finite rank subbundle of f using the connection and the metrics on f and x we can give the total space fa a canonical structure of a riemannian manifold on c algebras and k theory for fredholm manifolds 3 and define the component c algebra a f a c 0 r c f a c 0 r c 0 f a cliff tf a since the map f a 7 a f a is functorial with respect to inclusions of finite dimensional subbundles 45 we can then construct a direct limit c algebra a f lim fa f a f a where the direct limit is taken over all finite rank subbundles pa f a x of f trout 45 used this c algebra to prove an equivariant thom isomorphism theorem for infinite rank euclidean bundles which reduces to the higson kasparov trout bott periodicity theorem when the base manifold x is a point for a more general curved hilbert manifold m with riemannian metric g there does not seem to be a natural generalization of the previous constructions based on the above one would be tempted to construct a direct limit c algebra a m lim ma m a ma where the component c algebras should be given by a ma c 0 r c ma and the direct limit is taken over all finite dimensional submanifolds ma m the problem is that even though the component c algebras have many functoriality properties as discussed in section 2 if we are given smooth isometric inclusions ma mb mc of finite dimensional submanifolds of m there is no obvious way to define a com muting diagram as there is in the bott periodicity and thom isomorphism cases 1 a mb j j j j j j j j j a ma t t t t t t t t t a mc needed to construct the corresponding direct limit however if the hilbert manifold m has a fredholm structure then we can con struct a direct limit c algebra by choosing an appropriate countable sequence mn n k of expanding topologically closed finite dimensional submanifolds of dim mn n the sequence mn n k is called a fredholm filtration of m see section 3 for the geometric definitions and details the countability of this se quence of submanifolds clearly simplifies the direct limit construction since only each gysin map a mn a mn 1 needs to be constructed which will require some non trivial geometry i e connections and normal bundles equip the riemannian fredholm manifold m g with an augmented fredholm filtration f mn un n k as in definition 3 9 where un is a total open tubular neighborhood of mn mn 1 section 4 contains the construction of a noncom mutative direct limit c algebra for the triple m g f a m g f lim a mn that can play the role of the algebra of functions vanishing at infinity on m 4 dorin dumitras cu and jody trout using ideas of mukherjea 34 35 to associate cohomology functors to fredholm manifolds via fredholm filtrations the topological k theory groups of m f are defined as the direct limit k j m f lim kn j mn j 0 1 where the connecting map kn j mn k n 1 j mn 1 is the gysin or shriek map definition 5 1 of the embedding mn mn 1 and the inspiration for our connecting map a mn a mn 1 note that this definition does in general depend on the choice of fredholm filtration since the sequence mn n k may not be k orientable 17 12 but using appropriate notions of spinq structures see section 5 2 for riemann ian fredholm manifolds originally investigated by anastasiei 2 and de la harpe 14 the following serre swan and poincare duality isomorphism theorem combin ing theorems 5 13 and 5 19 is obtained theorem 1 1 let m g be a smooth fredholm manifold with oriented riemann ian q structure 1 q if m has a spinq structure then there are isomor phisms k j m f kj 1 a m g f k c j m j 0 1 where f mn un n k is any augmented fredholm filtration of m thus the k theory groups of m f and of the c algebra a m g f do not depend on the choice of the riemannian metric g or the augmented fredholm filtration f the dimension shift and the relation with poincare duality for finite dimensional spin manifolds then justifies our interpretation of a m g f as an appropriate non commutative suspension of the algebra of functions vanishing at infinity on m finally it should be noted that given a fredholm filtration mn n k of m we can also naturally associate an inverse limit algebra called by phillips 37 a c algebra c inv 0 m lim c 0 mn where the connecting map c 0 mn 1 c 0 mn is the pullback under the inclusion mn mn 1 however this algebra does not have the structure of a c algebra in general moreover if we try to define the topological k theory of m as the inverse limit using contravariance of topological k theory k j inv m lim kj mn j 0 1 then we do not get a well behaved functor indeed as buhshtaber and mishchenko have shown the resulting k theory sequence of a pair m n is not exact in general 9 10 even for cw complexes also k theory does not behave well with respect to inverse limits since there is a milnor lim 1 sequence theorem 3 2 38 0 lim 1 kj 1 mn rkj c inv 0 m k j inv m 0 where rkj is the representable k theory for c algebras developed by phillips 38 and weidner 47 hence there would be no corresponding serre swan duality theorem as in the finite dimensional category the authors would like to thank john roe carolyn gordon david webb dana williams gregory leibon and the referee for interesting discussions and helpful suggestions on c algebras and k theory for fredholm manifolds 5 2 clifford c algebras and the thom homomorphism in this section we assemble the constructions and results for finite dimensional manifolds that are needed to carry out the direct limit construction of the c algebra of an infinite dimensional fredholm manifold all of the manifolds in this section are assumed to be smooth hausdorff paracompact and finite dimensional for a detailed discussion of most of the results in this section including more proofs see section 2 of trout 45 let v be a finite dimensional euclidean vector space with inner product the complex clifford algebra of v denoted cliff v is the universal complex c algebra with unit generated by the elements of v such that v v and v w w v 2 v w 1 for all v w v it has a natural z 2 grading by declaring that all elements of v have odd degree the universal property 33 23 of cliff v is that if f v a is a real linear map of v into a unital complex c algebra a such that f v 2 v v 1 a for all v v then there is an induced c algebra homomorphism f cliff v a such that the following diagram commutes cliff v f g g g g g g g g g v c oo f a where we denote by c v cliff v the canonical inclusion however we will usually identify v c v cliff v for all v v an important property of these z 2 graded c algebras is their behavior with respect to orthogonal sums 2 cliff v w cliff v cliff w where denotes the z 2 graded tensor product see the books 33 23 for a review of clifford algebras and blackadar 6 for a review of graded c algebras let mn be a finite dimensional smooth riemannian manifold of dimension n with riemannian metric g let tmn mn denote the tangent bundle of mn let cliff tmn mn denote the clifford bundle 4 5 of tmn i e the bundle of clifford algebras over mn whose fiber at x mn is the complex clifford algebra cliff txmn of the euclidean tangent space txmn it has an induced z 2 graded c algebra bundle structure definition 2 1 29 denote by c mn the c algebra c mn c 0 mn cliff tmn of continuous sections of cliff tmn which vanish at infinity on mn with induced z 2 grading from cliff tmn kasparov 29 used the notation c mn for example if mn v is a finite dimensional euclidean vector space then tmn v v and so c mn c 0 v cliff v as in definition 2 2 25 a priori this c algebra depends on the riemannian metric g ofmn however the universal property of clifford algebras shows that the c algebra structure on c mn depends only on the manifold mn and not the chosen metric g indeed if h is another 6 dorin dumitras cu and jody trout riemannian metric on mn then h 1 g tmn tmn is an automorphism of the tangent bundle tmn where g tmn t mn is the co tangent bundle isomorphism induced by any metric g it satisfies h x x g x x 0 for any vector field x thus is positive definite with respect to the metric h and so has a positive square root i e a bundle automorphism tmn tmn such that h x x h x x g x x if cliff tmn h denotes the clifford bundle of mn with respect to the metric h then x 2 g x x 1 in cliff tmn h by the universal property above applied to each fiber extends to an isomorphism cliff tmn g cliff tmn h of clifford bundles see also section 9 1 23 by taking sections there is a canonically induced isomorphism c m g c m h of z 2 graded c algebras let c 0 mn denote the commutative c algebra of continuous complex valued functions on mn vanishing at infinity we always consider c 0 mn to be trivially graded if a z 2 graded c algebra a is equipped with a fixed homomorphism c 0 mn z m a that is nondegenerate and has grading degree zero where z m a denotes the center of the multiplier algebra of a then we say that a has a z 2 graded c 0 mn algebra structure 45 we denote f a f a for all f c 0 mn and a a note that pointwise multiplication fs x f x s x x mn where f c 0 mn and s c mn determines a nondegen erate homomorphism c 0 mn zm c mn into the center of the multiplier algebra of c mn of grading degree zero thus we have the following corollary 2 2 the c algebra c mn has a canonical z 2 graded c 0 mn algebra structure and up to z 2 graded isomorphism is independent of the riemannian metric on mn definition 2 3 let s denote the c algebra c 0 r of continuous complex valued functions on the real line which vanish at infinity with z 2 grading by even and odd functions if a is any z 2 graded c algebra then we let sa be the graded max tensor product s a in particular let a mn def sc mn s c 0 mn cliff tmn which can be viewed as a non commutative topological suspension of mn 1 the following functoriality result will be used when we identify the total space of the normal bundle of an embedding with an open tubular neighborhood lemma 2 4 45 let mn nn be a diffeomorphism of riemannian manifolds there is an induced z 2 graded c algebra isomorphism a mn a nn 1 recall that the suspension of a c algebra a is the c algebra sa c 0 r a in particular sc 0 mn c 0 r mn where r mn is the reduced topological suspension of mn on c algebras and k theory for fredholm manifolds 7 proof let g denote the metric on mn and h denote the metric on nn if mn nn is a diffeomorphism then using the pullback metric h we have that mn h nn h is an isometry of riemannian manifolds which clearly induces a canonical isomor phism c mn h c nn h of z 2 gradedc algebras by the argument above we have a canonical isomorphism c mn g c mn h taking the composition and tensoring with the identity of s gives the required canonical isomorphism ids a mn s c mn s c nn a nn of z 2 graded c algebras the following is an easy functoriality property for open inclusions lemma 2 5 45 let un be an open subset of the riemannian manifold mn the inclusion i un mn induces a short exact sequence 0 a un 1 i a mn a mn un 0 of c algebras thus a un a mn as a two sided c ideal let p e mn be a smooth finite rank euclidean vector bundle we will show that there is a natural thom homomorphism p a mn a e where we consider e as a finite dimensional manifold with riemannian structure to be constructed as follows the main example we have in mind is where e mn is the total space of the normal bundle of an isometric embedding mn mn 1 given p e mn there is a short exact sequence 1 5 of real vector bundles 0 v e te t p p tmn 0 where the vertical subbundle v e ker t p is isomorphic to p e this sequence does not have a canonical splitting in general but choosing a compatible connection on e determines an associated vector bundle splitting recall that a connection c mn e c mn t mn e on e is compatible 5 33 with the bundle metric on e if d s 1 s 2 s 1 s 2 s 1 s 2 for all smooth sections s 1 s 2 c mn e if p e mn is equipped with a compatible connection then we call e an affine euclidean bundle let c e p e c e t e p e denote the pullback of on the bundle p e e which is defined by the formula fp s df p s fp s for f c mn and s c mn e the tautological section c e p e is the smooth section of p e e defined by the formula e e e for all e e the derivative of will be denoted by c e t e p e 1 e p e 1 e v e 8 dorin dumitras cu and jody trout which is the connection 1 form of see definition 1 10 5 the kernel he ker p tmn of the connection 1 form is the horizontal subbundle of te which provides a splitting te v e he p e p tmn now give te the direct sum of the pullback metrics on p e and p tmn this gives e the structure of a riemannian manifold and makes the splitting of te orthogonal lemma 2 6 45 let p e mn be a finite rank affine euclidean bundle on the riemannian manifold mn there is an induced orthogonal splitting of the exact sequence 0 p e te p tmn 0 and so there is a canonical isomorphism of euclidean vector bundles te p e p tmn where p e and p tmn have the pullback metrics thus the manifold e has a canonical riemannian metric hence given a compatible connection on the euclidean bundle e we can define the c algebra c e as above using the induced riemannian structure on the manifold e however we also have the c algebra c 0 e cliff p e associated to the pullback bundle p e e 2 both c e and c 0 e cliff p e have natural c 0 e algebra structures however the bundle map p e mn induces a pullback homomorphism 41 p c 0 mn cb e m c 0 e f 7 p f f p which induces a graded c 0 mn algebra structure on any graded c 0 e algebra definition 2 7 45 let a and b be z 2 graded c 0 mn algebras the balanced tensor product over mn denoted a mnb is the quotient of the maximal graded tensor product a b 6 by the ideal j generated by f a b a f b a a b b f c 0 mn for example c 0 mn mna a via the map induced by f a 7 f a the following is an important result that relates these two c algebras to the c algebra c mn of the base manifold mn theorem 2 8 let p e mn be a finite rank affine euclidean bundle on the riemannian manifold mn there is a natural isomorphism of graded c algebras c e c 0 e cliff p e mnc mn proof by the previous lemma there is an induced orthogonal splitting te p e p tmn thus we have an induced isomorphism of z 2 graded clifford algebra bundles cliff te cliff p e p tmn cliff p e p cliff tmn 3 2 note although c 0 e cliff p e p c 0 mn cliff e we will not need this isomorphism on c algebras and k theory for fredholm manifolds 9 therefore by taking sections we have canonical balanced tensor product isomor phisms see proposition a 7 45 c e def c 0 e cliff te c 0 e cliff p e p cliff tmn c 0 e cliff p e e c 0 e cliff p tmn but we have using pullbacks along p e mn that there are canonical pullback isomorphisms see proposition a 9 45 c 0 e cliff p tmn p c 0 m cliff tmn p c mn def c 0 e mnc mn hence it follows that c e c 0 e cliff p e e c 0 e cliff p tmn c 0 e cliff p e e c 0 e mnc mn c 0 e cliff p e mnc mn using the canonical isomorphism a e c 0 e a for graded c 0 e algebras we now wish to define a certain thom operator for the vertical algebra c 0 e cliff p e associate to the euclidean bundle e an unbounded section ce e cliff p e e 7 cp e e where cp e is the clifford operator on the euclidean space ep e from definition 2 4 of 25 it is given globally by the composition e ce 77 p e c cliff p e where c e p e is the tautological section see above and c p e cliff p e is the canonical inclusion c e 1 e 2 cp e 1 e 2 the following is then easy to prove theorem 2 9 let e be a finite rank euclidean bundle on mn multiplication by the section ce e cliff p e determines a degree one essentially self adjoint unbounded multiplier see definition a 1 45 of the c algebra c 0 e cliff p e with domain cc e cliff p e we will call ce the thom operator of e mn thus we have a functional calculus homomorphism s m c 0 e cliff p e f f ce from s to the multiplier algebra of c 0 e cliff p e note that f ce goes to zero in the fiber directions on e since p e is constant but is only bounded in the manifold directions on e indeed for the generators f x exp x 2 and g x x exp x 2 of s we have that f ce and g ce are respectively multiplication by the following functions on e f ce e exp e 2 and g ce e e exp e 2 e e definition 2 10 let x denote the degree one essentially self adjoint unbounded multiplier of s with domain the compactly supported functions given by multipli cation by x i e xf x xf x for all f cc r and x r 10 dorin dumitras cu and jody trout by lemma a 3 45 the operator x 1 1 ce determines a degree one essen tially self adjoint unbounded multiplier of the tensor product s c 0 e cliff p e sc 0 e cliff p e with domain cc r cc e cliff p e we obtain a functional calculus homomor phism e s m sc 0 e cliff p e f 7 f x 1 1 ce from s into the multiplier algebra of sc 0 e cliff p e now we can define our thom homomorphism for a finite rank affine euclidean bundle this will pro vide part of the connecting map in section 4 when we define the direct limit c algebra for an infinite dimensional riemannian fredholm manifold theorem 2 11 let p e mn be a finite rank affine euclidean bundle on the riemannian manifold mn with respect to the isomorphism a e s c 0 e cliff p e mnc mn from theorem 2 8 there is a graded homomorphism p e mn idmn a mn a e which on elementary tensors f s s c mn a mn is given by f s 7 f x 1 1 ce mns proof from the discussion above we have that e mn idmn is the composition a mn e id m sc 0 e cliff p e c mn m sc 0 e cliff p e mnc mn checking on the generator f x exp x 2 of s we compute that f x 1 1 ce s exp x 2 exp e 2 mns a e similarly for g x x exp x 2 we find that g x 1 1 ce mns x exp x 2 exp e 2 mns exp x 2 e exp e 2 mns a e it follows that the range of p e mn idmn is in a e as desired since the space of compatible connections on e mn is convex we have the following result proposition 2 12 let p e mn be a smooth finite rank affine euclidean bundle on the riemannian manifold mn the homotopy class of the homomorphism p a mn a e is independent of the choice of compatible connection on e proposition 2 13 if p e mn v mn is a trivial finite rank affine euclidean bundle with trivial connection 0 d then we have a z 2 graded isomorphism c e c v c mn such that the thom map has the form p v idc mn a mn s c mn a v c mn a e where v s a v f 7 f x 1 1 cv is the thom map for v 0 on c algebras and k theory for fredholm manifolds 11 proof the trivial connection 0 d gives the manifold e mn v the riemannian metric induced by the isomorphism te tmn tv mn v e the pullback vector bundle p e e has the form p e mn v v mn v e and so the clifford bundle cliff p e mn v cliff v which gives c 0 e cliff p e c 0 mn v mn v cliff v c 0 v cliff v c 0 mn by theorem 2 8 it follows that c e c 0 e cliff p e mnc mn c 0 v cliff v c 0 mn mnc mn c v c mn where we used the isomorphism c 0 mn mnc mn c mn the result now easily follows for example if p eb ea is the orthogonal projection of a finite dimensional euclidean vector space eb onto a linear subspace ea then p ba is the bott homomorphism from definition 3 1 of higson kasparov trout 25 3 fredholm manifolds and filtrations fredholm manifolds are a particular case of hilbert manifolds i e manifolds modeled on a separable infinite dimensional real hilbert space most of the stan dard constructions from the differential geometry of finite dimensional manifolds carry on in the infinite dimensional situation as reference see lang s book 32 all the hilbert manifolds that we consider in this paper are assumed to be con nected separable paracompact hausdorff and infinitely smooth let e be a separable infinite dimensional euclidean space i e a real hilbert space of countably infinite dimension we will use the following notation l e denotes the real c algebra of bounded linear operators on e f f e denotes the finite rank operators k k e denotes the closed ideal of compact operators e denotes the fredholm operators and gl e denotes the banach lie group of units of l e with identity i definition 3 1 a perturbation class p of e is a subspace p p e of l e such that 1 f e p e 2 p e is an ideal in l e and 3 e p e e as examples of perturbation classes we have the finite rank operators f e the compact operators k e or indeed any proper two sided ideal included in k for 1 q let pq be the perturbation class defined as the closure of f e under the norm 4 t q trace t t q 2 1 q if q 1 one obtains the trace class operators and if q 2 the hilbert schmidt operators if q then we set p k e with norm t t given a perturbation class p of e we let glp e gl e i p e t i k t gl e k p e 12 dorin dumitras cu and jody trout for 1 q we abbreviate glpq e glq e for p we abbreviate glk e e glk e we topologize glq e by requiring that the map glq e pq k 7 i k be a homeomorphism where is the set of all k with i k invertible 36 in general glp e is a normal subgroup of gl e but where gl e is contractible by kuiper s theorem 31 glp e may not be contractible for example by theorem b of palais 36 we have that 0 glq e z 2 z for all 1 q however glp e is not a closed subgroup of gl e unless p p k e definition 3 2 let m be a hilbert manifold modeled on e a fredholm structure on m is an integrable reduction of the principal gl e bundle of m to glk e equivalently it is a maximal atlas of m such that the differential of the change of coordinates maps is an element of glk e at every point a fredholm manifold is a hilbert manifold with a specified fredholm structure since there is a natural inclusion glp e glk e induced by the inclusion p e k e if a hilbert manifold m is equipped with a reduction of it s structure group from gl e to glp e then we can give m a canonical fredholm structure in the sense of the previous definition we will make use of this fact when discussing spin structures for fredholm manifolds in section 5 note a c map f m n between hilbert manifolds is called a fredholm map if for every x m df x txm tf x n is a fredholm operator fredholm manifolds are exactly the manifolds on which fredholm maps can be constructed results of elworthy and tromba 21 show that for a fredholm manifold m there is an index zero even bounded and proper fredholm map f m e the following decomposition theorem is crucial in the study of fredholm mani folds 34 thm 2 2 theorem 3 3 let m be a fredholm manifold there exists a sequence mn n k of finite dimensional closed submanifolds such that i dim mn n mn mn 1 ii the inclusions mn mn 1 and mn m have trivial normal bundles iii m n kmn is dense in m and iv the natural inclusion map m m is a homotopy equivalence if m is given the direct limit topology a sequence mn n k as in the theorem above is called a fredholm filtration of m we will now give some examples and a non example of fredholm manifolds and filtrations examples 3 4 i the euclidean spacem e has an obvious fredholm structure determined by a single chart i e e it is the only possible structure let en n 1 be an orthonormal basis of e and en be the linear span of e 1 e 2 en the sequence en n is known as a flag of e and it forms a fredholm filtration ii the unit sphere of e se x e x 1 gets by restriction from e a fredholm structure as a fredholm filtration we have s 1 s 2 sn se iii the following is a non example the sequence of real projective spaces rp 1 rp 2 rpn rpe on c algebras and k theory for fredholm manifolds 13 is not a fredholm filtration of the infinite dimensional real projective space rpe of e for any choice of fredholm structure because the inclusions rpn rpn 1 do not have trivial normal bundles to get an idea how fredholm filtrations are constructed in general we briefly outline the procedure as follows let m be a fredholm manifold modeled on e let en n be a flag for e as in example 3 4 i above choose an index zero fredholm map f m e which is transversal to the en s and define mn f 1 en each mn when nonempty is a finite dimensional submanifold of m of dimension n and mn mn 1 the normal bundle mn mn of the inclusion mn mn 1 is the pullback mn f en of the trivial normal bundle en e n en 1 and hence is trivial the sequence mn n k where mk 6 is the first nonempty submanifold forms a fredholm filtration of m note that since there is always a bounded proper index zero fredholm map f m e the mn s can be chosen to be compact see the addendum to theorem 2 c in eells and elworthy 19 one can actually say more about the fredholm filtrations of a fredholmmanifold but we need to recall first some facts about the differential geometry of infinite dimensional manifolds definition 3 5 let n be a submanifold of m a tubular neighborhood of n in m consist of the following data a vector bundle b n over n an open neighborhood v of the zero section n in b an open set u in m containing n and a diffeomorphism f v u which commutes with the zero section n v v v f n hh i u u is called the tube of the tubular neighborhood the tubular neighborhood is called total if v b the total space of the bundle using the notion of spray 32 iv 3 its associated exponential map and restriction to the normal bundle of the inclusion i n m one can prove the existence and uniqueness of tubular neighborhoods if m is a hilbert manifold 32 theorems iv 5 1 and iv 6 2 on a riemannian manifold one can always choose tubular neighborhood to be total definition 3 6 a riemannian manifold is a pair m g where m is a hilbert manifold and g is a metric on m i e gx is a smoothly varying positive definite non singular symmetric bilinear form on txm for every x m according with 32 cor ii 3 8 every paracompact c manifold modeled on a separable hilbert space admits partitions of unity of class c it follows that hilbert manifolds admit riemannian metrics proposition 3 7 32 prop vii 1 1 let m be a manifold admitting partitions of unity and let b m be a vector bundle whose fibers are hilbertable vector spaces then admits a riemannian metric granted all of this the next statement is a combination of 34 thm 2 3 and remarks from 35 and 19 14 dorin dumitras cu and jody trout theorem 3 8 let m be a fredholm manifold with riemannian metric g com patible with the topology of m there exists a fredholm filtration mn n k of m for which geodesically defined exponential neighborhoods zn of mn in m can be constructed satisfying zn zn 1 and n k zn m moreover un zn mn 1 is a tubular neighborhood of mn in mn 1 for each n k definition 3 9 we call a fredholm filtration mn n k together with a collection un n k where un is a total tubular neighborhood of mn mn 1 an augmented fredholm filtration and we shall denote this by f mn un n k note that we assume that each un is equipped with a fixed diffeomorphism n mn un fredholm manifolds often arise as spaces of paths and we end this section with one more example in section 5 example 5 10 we will discuss examples of fred holm manifolds arising from loop groups g of certain compact lie groups g and their associated spin structures example 3 10 see 20 let x be a complete finite dimensional riemannian manifold and a x let m pa x be the space of paths 0 1 x with 0 a and absolutely continuous with square integrable derivative then m is a separable smooth hilbert manifold moreover a complete riemannian structure on m is given by g u v u v 1 0 d u d v for u v t m whered denotes the covariant derivative along there is natural diffeomorphism pa x p 0 tax t t 0 s 0 s ds where s 0 denotes parallel transport along from t s x to tax this map called e cartan s development map gives a diffeomorphism ofm pa x with the hilbert space p 0 tax and hence a unique fredholm structure on the contractible space m 4 the c algebra of a fredholm manifold let m be a smooth separable connected paracompact hilbert manifold mod eled on the separable infinite dimensional euclidean space e we assume that m is equipped with a riemannian fredholm structure i e a reduction of the structure group of m from gl e to glk e and a riemannian metric g that is compatible with the topology of m this is equivalent to a reduction of the structure group from gl e to k e glk e o e see section 5 2 let f mn un n k be an augmented fredholm filtration of m by closed n dimensional submanifolds mn with total tubular neighborhoods mn un mn 1 as in definition 3 9 let pn mn mn denote the normal bundle of the embedding jn mn mn 1 that is we have a short exact sequence 0 tmn tmn 1 mn mn 0 of finite rank vector bundles on c algebras and k theory for fredholm manifolds 15 these geometric considerations lead us to the following topological diagram of bundles and spaces 5 mn pn normal n diffeo un kn open mn 1 mn where the tubular neighborhood un is identified with the total space of the normal bundle mn via a fixed diffeomorphism n mn un and kn un mn 1 denotes the open inclusion for each n let mn have the induced riemannian metric gn i n g where in mn m denotes the inclusion thus for each n k we have the associated c algebra a mn sc mn s c 0 mn cliff tmn as in definition 2 3 recall that s denotes the c algebra c 0 r graded by even and odd functions the restricted bundle tmn 1 mn is the pullback bundle j n tmn 1 under the inclusion jn mn mn 1 thus there is an induced pullback metric j n g and pullback connection j n n 1 on tmn 1 mn where n 1 is the levi civita connection of mn 1 5 using this pullback metric we have an orthogonal splitting tmn 1 mn tmn mn of vector bundles on mn give mn the induced bundle metric and projected connection mn thus pn mn mn has a canonical structure as an affine euclidean bundle by theorem 2 11 there is an induced c algebra homomorphism pn a mn a mn where mn is given the riemannian metric from lemma 2 6 give the open set un mn 1 the induced riemannian metric k n gn 1 from mn 1 by lemma 2 5 we have an inclusion of c algebras kn a un a mn 1 induced by the inclusion kn un mn 1 finally we have by lemma 2 4 a canonical c algebra isomorphism n a mn a un induced by the diffeomorphism n mn un of the tubular neighborhood un with the total space mn of the normal bundle thus we have the following diagram of c algebras and homomorphisms which can be considered as the non commutative version of diagram 5 above 6 a mn n a un kn a mn 1 a mn pn thom oo n 44 i i i i i i i i i 16 dorin dumitras cu and jody trout the dotted arrow which is by definition the composition of the other three gives the connecting map n a mn a mn 1 in the definition of our c algebra a m g f definition 4 1 let m be a smooth fredholm manifold 3 modeled on the sep arable infinite dimensional euclidean space e equipped with a riemannian met ric g compatible with the topology of m and an augmented fredholm filtration f mn un n k the c algebra of the triple m g f is the direct limit c algebra 7 a m g f lim a mn where the direct limit is taken over the directed system a mn n n k and the connecting maps n are given by diagram 6 it easily follows thata m g f has the structure of a z 2 graded separable nuclear c algebra one can also show using lemma 2 4 and the construction in lemma 2 6 that a m g f does not depend up to isomorphism of z 2 graded c algebras on the choice of the riemannian metric g of m indeed we have lemma 4 2 let m be a smooth fredholm manifold with augmented fredholm filtration f mn un n k if g and h are riemannian metrics on m compatible with the topology there is a canonical map a m g f a m h f which is an isomorphism of z 2 graded c algebras proof the identity map idm m g m h is a diffeomorphism of riemann ian fredholm manifolds and induces for each n k a commuting diagram a mn gn a mn g n a un k n gn 1 a mn 1 gn 1 a mn hn a mn h n a un k n hn 1 a mn 1 hn 1 where g n and h n are the riemannian metrics induced on the total space mn by lemma 2 6 and the vertical maps are the z 2 graded c algebra isomorphisms induced by idmn mn gn mn hn from lemma 2 4 the result now easily follows by the universal property for direct limits 46 since the composition of the top and bottom rows are the connecting maps in the direct limits a m g f and a m h f respectively the c algebra a m g f does indeed depend on the choice of the augmented fredholm filtration f mn un n k however we will see in the next section that the k theory groups of a m g f do not depend on the choice of the tubular neighborhoods un n k and moreover ifm has an appropriate spin structure then the k theory groups do not depend on the choice of filtrating manifolds mn n k we will now consider two examples from the literature that are directly related to this construction example 4 3 consider m e with metric g induced by the inner product and fredholm filtration given by a flag en n of e as in example 3 4 i 3 recall that we assume m to be connected separable paracompact and hausdorff on c algebras and k theory for fredholm manifolds 17 setting en un en 1 we obtain an augmented fredholm filtration f en en 1 n 1 of e we thus have the c algebra a e g f lim a en as constructed above since ten en en is trivial we have that a en s c 0 en cliff en sc en as in definition 3 1 of higson kasparov trout 25 also since en un en 1 it follows that the connecting map n a en a en 1 can be canonically identified with the bott periodicity map n 1 n n a en a en 1 of definition 3 1 in 25 using an approximation argument to deal with the dense subalgebra of compactly supported functions it follows that the c algebra a e g f is isomorphic to the c algebra a e lim ea e a ea where the direct limit is taken over the directed system of all finite dimensional subspaces ea e see also lemma 2 6 and the discussion after definition 4 6 of higson kasparov 24 this c algebra has important applications to the baum connes and novikov conjectures 24 25 49 example 4 4 another example which generalizes the previous one comes from the thom isomorphism theorem for infinite rank euclidean vector bundles 45 suppose m is the total space of a smooth locally trivial vector bundle p m x with fiber e and structure group gl e over a smooth finite dimensional riemannian manifold x of dimension k since the fiber e is infinite dimensional we may assume 16 that m x e is trivial the inner product on e then canonically induces a euclidean metric structure on the bundle m using the isomorphism tm tx te tx e e we canonically endow the total space m with the structure of a riemannian hilbert manifold also since tm is trivial it follows that m has a canonical structure as a fredholm manifold let en n 1 be a flag for e for each n k 1 let mn x en k x denote the trivial vector subbundle of rank n k one can then check that the collection of submanifolds mn n k 1 determines a fredholm filtration of m such that we can canonically identify the total space mn of the normal bundle of mn mn 1 as mn 1 we then have that f mn mn 1 n k 1 is an augmented fredholm filtration for m since mn x en k we have a mn a en k c x s c en k c x it follows from proposition 2 13 the results in 45 and a similar approximation argument that a m g f a e c x a m 0 x where a m 0 x is the c algebra of the affine euclidean bundle p m x equipped with the trivial connection 0 d as in definition 3 11 of 45 18 dorin dumitras cu and jody trout 5 k theory spin structures and poincare duality in this section we discuss the relationship between the topological k theory groups the compactly supported k homology groups of a fredholm manifold m and the k theory groups of the c algebra a m g f we constructed in the last section when an oriented riemannian fredholm manifold m has been equipped with an appropriate infinite dimensional spin structure we will see that all of these groups coincide as in the finite dimensional spin manifold setting 5 1 the topologicalk theory of a fredholmmanifold mukherjea 35 sec 2 in the context of generalized cohomologies obtained from a spectrum on the cate gory of compact spaces defined the corresponding cohomology groups for fredholm manifolds based on his work we are led to make the following definition definition 5 1 let m be smooth fredholm manifold with augmented fredholm filtration f mn un n k the j th topological k theory group of m f denoted k j m f is defined to be the direct limit k j m f lim kn j mn for j 0 1 where the connecting maps are the gysin or shriek maps 12 27 jn k n j mn k n 1 j mn 1 associated to the inclusions jn mn mn 1 these may be obtained from diagram 5 via the functoriality properties of topological k theory as the composition of gysin maps 8 kn 1 j mn n kn 1 j un kn kn 1 j mn 1 kn j mn s thom oo jn 22 eeeeeeeeeeeeeeee where the map s is the gysin map associated to the zero section s mn mn and which induces the thom isomorphism compare this with diagram 6 clearly the definition of the topological k theory of m does not depend on the choice of tubular neighborhoods un n or any riemannian metric g but does a priori depend on the choice of fredholm filtration mn n as does the definition of a m g f however if m has a certain infinite dimensional spin structure then these topological k theory groups k j m f do not depend on the choice of f mn un n 5 2 fredholm spinq structures recall the notation introduced at the begin ning of section 3 let e be a separable infinite dimensional euclidean space for 1 q let glq e gl e i pq where pq is the q th schatten von neumann perturbation class let e denote the orthogonal operators on e we let q e e glq e and let s q e denote the connected component of i in q e all of these groups are infinite dimensional banach lie groups 13 with manifold topology given by the restriction of the norm q note that since pq k e it follows that glq e glk e and so any hilbert manifold with glq e as structure group has a canonical fredholm structure as in definition 3 2 let m be a smooth paracompact connected hilbert manifold without bound ary modeled on e let e m be a smooth locally trivial vector bundle over on c algebras and k theory for fredholm manifolds 19 m with fiber e endowed with a reduction of the structure group from gl e to glq e a riemannian q structure 2 def 2 1 on is a reduction of the structure group from glq e to q e since m is paracompact this may be accomplished by using a partition of unity to define a smooth bundle metric gx on the fibers ex of if is the tangent bundle tm m with fredholm structure group glq e then we say that m has a riemannian q structure definition 5 2 2 def 2 2 a riemannian q structure on e m is orientable if admits a further reduction of its structure group to s q e a given reduction will be called an orientation and will be said to have an oriented riemannian q structure a proof of the following can be found in 30 prop 6 2 or 2 thm 2 1 theorem 5 3 a riemannian q structure on e m is orientable if and only if the first stieffel whitney class w 1 h 1 m z 2 vanishes in particular if m has a riemannian q structure then m is orientable if and only if w 1 m w 1 tm 0 for the theory of stieffel whitney classes associated to hilbert bundles over hilbert manifolds that we are considering see koschorke 30 note that contrary to the finite dimensional case these characteristic classes are not diffeomorphism invariants in general see 30 example 6 2 for details since s q e is of index 2 in q e it follows that the universal covering spinq e is a banach lie group and the covering map is 2 sheeted we thus have an exact sequence of paracompact topological groups 1 z 2 spinq e s q e 1 concrete realizations of these infinite dimensional spin groups were constructed for q 1 by p de la harpe 14 and for q 2 by plymen and streater 40 however we will not need explicit constructions of these spin groups only the fact that they are 2 sheeted covering groups of the associated special orthogonal groups as in the finite dimensional case in the following we may abbreviate spinq and soq for spinq e and soq e respectively definition 5 4 2 def 2 4 suppose e m has an soq structure i e an oriented riemannian q structure a spinq structure on is a principal bundle extension associated to the covering map spinq soq of the principal soq bundle of linear frames of if m is a fredholm manifold with oriented riemannian q structure then a spinq structure on m is a spinq structure on tm m we will then call m a fredholm spinq manifold that is if p l m is the principal soq bundle of oriented orthonormal frames of e m then a spinq structure for is a principal spinq bundle q m such that is a 2 fold covering of l the restriction of the covering map l to the fibers are 2 sheeted coverings and s g s g and q s p s 20 dorin dumitras cu and jody trout for all s and g spinq thus the following diagram commutes q l p m idm m for q 1 de la harpe has shown that the existence of a spinq structure on a fredholm manifold m with oriented riemannian q structure is equivalent to the vanishing w 2 m 0 of the second stieffel whitney class in h 2 m z 2 we wish to extend his result to all values 1 q and all soq vector bundles although his argument for q 1 almost certainly holds in the general case we will provide a more direct proof using an argument of lawson and michelson 33 from the finite dimensional spin case in order to do that we need the following cohomology computation which follows from some results in the literature 13 15 but we provide a proof for completeness lemma 5 5 for 1 q h 1 s q e z 2 z 2 proof choose a flag en for e as in example 3 4 i this induces an inclusion of topological groups so lim so n s q e which by proposition 3 in 15 is a homotopy equivalence hence using the identity as basepoint we have by bott periodicity 7 1 s q e 1 so lim 1 so n z 2 since s q e is connected with abelian fundamental group it follows that h 1 s q e 1 s q e z 2 the result now follows from the universal coefficient theorem in cohomology h 1 s q e z 2 hom h 1 s q e z z 2 hom z 2 z 2 z 2 and we are done theorem 5 6 let e m be a hilbert bundle with oriented riemannian q structure then has a spinq structure if and only if the second stieffel whitney class w 2 h 2 m z 2 vanishes in particular if m is a fredholm manifold with oriented riemannian q structure then there exists a spinq structure on m if and only if w 2 m 0 for the following recall that in principal bundle theory if m is a paracompact space and g is a topological group then h 1 m g is isomorphic to the set of isomorphism classes of principal g bundles on m where we are using c ech coho mology see appendix a of lawson and michelsohn 33 proof let p l m be the principal soq bundle of oriented orthonormal frames of we then have a fibration s q e i l p m which induces an exact sequence h 1 m z 2 p h 1 l z 2 i h 1 s q e z 2 h 2 m z 2 on c algebras and k theory for fredholm manifolds 21 in c ech cohomology it follows by the above discussion see also 2 thm 2 3 that has a spinq structure if and only if there is a cohomology class h 1 l z 2 such that i 6 0 since a spinq structure on determines a nontrivial 2 sheeted covering of l let g 2 be the generator ofh 1 s q e z 2 z 2 it follows that has a spinq structure if and only if there is a cohomology class h 1 l z 2 such that i g 2 consequently by exactness of the sequence above we have that this holds if and only if w 2 g 2 i 0 h 2 m z 2 the fact that the second stieffel whitney class of is given by w 2 g 2 h 2 m z 2 follows from the universal properties of these classes 30 proposition 6 3 consequently if e m admits a spinq structure determined by h 1 l z 2 then the most general spinq structure on is of the form p where h 1 m z 2 thus there is a bijection between the set of isomorphism classes of spinq structures on and h 1 m z 2 it follows that a spinq structure on or m is unique if h 1 m z 2 0 the next two results are immediate corollaries see theorems 2 5 and 2 6 of 2 proposition 5 7 given spinq structures on two out of the three vector bundles 1 2 and 1 2 on m there is a uniquely determined spinq structure on the third proposition 5 8 if e m admits a spinq structure and f n m is smooth then the pull back vector bundle f f e n admits a spinq structure in the context of fredholm manifolds the above give corollary 5 9 let m be a fredholm spinq manifold if mn n is any associated fredholm filtration of m then each mn has a canonical finite dimensional spin structure indeed associated to the inclusion in mn m we have a split short exact sequence 0 tmn tm mn mn 0 the normal bundle mn has a spinq structure being trivial and tm mn i n tm has one because of proposition 5 8 thus we have w 2 mn w 2 tm mn 0 and finally proposition 5 7 gives the result since w 2 mn 0 we end this subsection about spin structures with an example coming from certain based loop groups example 5 10 consider a compact connected simply connected simple lie group g let sg h s 0 s 1 g be the group of based loops on g i e maps from the circle to g in the sth sobolev space hs which take a fixed point on s 1 into the identity element of g where s 1 2 sg is a real hilbert lie group d freed constructed in 22 sec 5 a particular fredholm 1 structure coming from a classifying map sg bgl c 0 22 dorin dumitras cu and jody trout where 0 denotes the fredholm operators of index zero the resulting frame bundle was called the geometric frame bundle he concluded that the realification of this geometric frame bundle is trivial and that the stieffel whitney classes of sg vanish 22 thm 5 30 our theorem 5 6 now shows that this is the unique spin 1 structure on sg indeed the hypothesis on g implies that 0 g 1 g 2 g 0 and 3 g z consequently h 1 sg z 0 and h 2 sg z 2 sg 3 g z these imply that h 1 sg z 2 0 and h 2 sg z 2 z 2 as w 2 sg 0 by freed s corollary 5 31 and as spin 1 structures on g are parametrized by h 1 sg z 2 0 we obtain the claimed uniqueness of the spin 1 structure on sg moreover freed s fredholm structure is actually the unique spinq structure for all 1 q 5 3 k homology and poincare duality recall that if x is a compact space then the j thk homology group ofx is the abelian groupkj x kk j c x c which is dual to the j th k theory group kj x kkj c c x the map x 7 kj x defines a generalized homology theory on the category of compact spaces and continuous maps 8 28 26 definition 5 11 let m be a paracompact space the jth compactly supported k homology group of m is kcj m lim x m kj x where the direct limit is over all the compact subsets x m and j 0 1 in order to prove our poincare duality result we need the following result whose proof requires the kk theory for pro c algebras developed by weidner 47 and phillips 38 a heuristic proof would be that since m m lim mn we have in compactly supported k homology that kcj m kcj m lim kcj mn proposition 5 12 let m be a smooth fredholm manifold if mn n k is any fredholm filtration of m then there is an isomorphism of abelian groups kcj m lim kcj mn j 0 1 where the connecting map kcj mn k c j mn 1 in the direct limit is induced by the inclusion mn mn 1 proof let g be a riemannian metric on m compatible with the topology which exists via paracompactness thus m g is a metric space since metric spaces are compactly generated 48 i 4 3 it follows that the algebra c m of all contin uous complex valued functions on m with the topology of uniform convergence on compact subsets is a pro c algebra with involution given by pointwise complex conjugation 37 ex 1 3 3 let cm denote the collection of all compact subsets x of m ordered by inclusion since m is regular it is completely hausdorff 37 def 2 2 and so by corollary 2 9 of 37 it follows that there is an isomorphism 9 c m lim x cm c x of pro c algebras similarly for each n we have an isomorphism 10 c mn lim kn cmn c kn on c algebras and k theory for fredholm manifolds 23 of pro c algebras where cmn denotes the set of all compact subsets kn of mn ordered by inclusion let m n mn lim mn with the direct limit topology since m is countably compactly generated in the direct limit topology we then have an isomorphism 11 c m lim n c mn of pro c algebras by theorem 3 3 the inclusion m m is a homotopy equiv alence hence the pro c algebras c m and c m have the same homotopy type using the fact that weidner s kk groups kk j w a b for pro c algebras 47 38 extend kasparov s kk groups for c algebras 28 are homotopy invariant and convert inverse limits to direct limits 4 in the k homology variable we compute as follows kcj m lim x cm kkj c x c definition 5 11 kk j w lim x cx c x c by 47 thm 5 1 kk j w c m c by eqn 9 kk j w c m c homotopy invariance kk j w lim n c mn c by

manifolds with 35 thm 2 1 theorem 5 13 poincare duality if m is a smooth fredholm spinq manifold with augmented fredholm filtration f there is an isomorphism k j m f kcj m proof let f mn un n k be the augmented fredholm filtration since m is a fredholm spinq manifold each mn has a canonical spin structure by corollary 5 9 by 43 cor 31 or 26 exercise 11 8 11 we have a natural poincare duality isomorphism pn k n j mn kcj mn 4 note that there is a typo in the statement of 47 thm 5 1 24 dorin dumitras cu and jody trout given by the cap product with the fundamental class mn naturality is the asser tion that the poincare duality diagram kn j mn jn kn 1 j mn 1 kcj mn pn oo jn kcj mn 1 pn 1 oo commutes where jn mn mn 1 it now follows that kcj m lim kcj mn proposition 5 12 lim kn j mn classical poincare duality k j m f definition 5 1 as desired 5 4 k theory of the c algebra a m g f first we discuss the finite di mensional results we will need let mn be an oriented riemannian n manifold an important relationship between the non commutative c algebra c mn c 0 mn cliff tmn and the commutative c algebra c 0 mn is given by spin c structures 33 let c 1 cliff r denote the first complex clifford algebra the following is adapted from theorem 2 11 of plymen 39 and proposition ii a 9 of connes 11 proposition 5 14 if n 2 k is even there is a bijective correspondence between spinc structures on mn and morita equivalences in the sense of rieffel 42 44 between the c algebras c 0 mn and c mn thus a mn is morita equivalent to c 0 r mn if n 2 k 1 is odd then spin c structures on m are in bijective correspondence with morita equivalences c 0 mn c mn c 1 although c mn and a mn carry natural z 2 gradings when we consider their c algebra k theory we will ignore these gradings that is if a is any c algebra graded or not then kj a j 0 1 will denote the k theory group of the underlying c algebra without the grading since c algebra k theory is morita invariant we have the following corollary 5 15 if m 2 k is an even dimensional oriented riemannian manifold with spinc structure there is a canonical k theory isomorphism 5 kj a m 2 k k j 1 m 2 k the next result is proved by trout 45 thm 2 14 thom isomorphism theorem 5 16 if e mn is a smooth finite rank affine euclidean bundle then the homomorphism p a mn a e from theorem 2 11 induces an isomorphism of abelian groups kj a mn kj a e for j 0 1 in fact it is the c algebraic formulation of the classical thom isomorphism kj m kj e from topological k theory 5 it is also true that kj c m 2 k k j m 2 k but we shall not use this here on c algebras and k theory for fredholm manifolds 25 corollary 5 17 45 cor 2 20 if e is a finite even rank oriented euclidean spinc bundle with spin connection on an even dimensional oriented riemannian spinc manifold mn then p a mn a e induces the topological thom iso morphism as depicted in the following commutative diagram kj a mn kj a e kj 1 mn kj 1 e although the connecting maps n a

of finite dimensional smooth riemannian manifolds is homotopy invariant has gysin maps indepen dent of the choice of tubular neighborhood and most importantly a transitive thom homomorphism 45 lem 3 10 the result now follows from the correspond ing proof in karoubi 27 props 5 22 and 5 24 for topological k theory we now come to the main result of our paper theorem 5 19 let m be a smooth fredholm
