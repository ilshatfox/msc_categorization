geometric homology we show how to recover the main oper ations of string topology built by m chas and d sullivan we also study and build an action of the homology of reduced sullivan s chord diagrams on the singular homology of free loop spaces extending pre vious results of r cohen and v godin and unifying part of the rich algebraic structure of string topology as an algebra over the prop of these reduced diagrams some of these operations are extended to spaces of maps from a sphere to a compact manifold 1 introduction the study of spaces of maps is an important and difficult task of alge braic topology in this paper we study n sphere spaces they are topological spaces of unbased maps from a n sphere into a manifold our aim is to study the algebraic structure of the homology of these spaces let us begin by giving some motivations for the study of such spaces we focus on free loop spaces n 1 the study of free loop spaces over a compact oriented manifold plays a central role in algebraic topology there is a non exhaustive list of topics where free loop spaces appear let us review some of them free loop spaces are one of the main tool in order to study closed geodesics on riemannian manifolds let m be riemannian compact connected simply connected of dimension greater than one d gromoll and w meyer proved that there exist infinitely many geometrically distinct peri odic geodesics on an arbitrary riemannian manifold if the betti numbers of the free loop space of m are unbounded 25 and using methods of rational homotopy theory m vigue and d sullivan showed that these rational betti numbers are unbounded if and only if the rational cohomology has at least two generators 51 according to works of d burghelea and z fiedorowicz 7 of t goodwillie 24 and of j d s jones 31 the cohomology of free loop spaces is strongly related to hochschild homology and the s 1 equivariant cohomology of free date january 22 2018 the author was partially supported by dgesic grant pb 97 0202 1 http arxiv org abs math 0306080 v 2 2 d chataur loop spaces is also related to cyclic homology and over a field of characteris tic zero to waldhausen algebraic k theory hence rationally the homotopy of free loop spaces is related to the space of automorphisms of manifolds via waldhausen s theory to go further in this direction there are also some relations between the suspension spectrum of the free loop spaces and topological cyclic homology 5 analysis on such spaces has always been a source of constant inspiration for example one can cite the work of e witten on index of dirac operators on free loop spaces 54 this was the beginning of the theory of elliptic genera and elliptic cohomology 46 this shed new lights on the periodicity phenomena in stable homotopy and the analysis underlying it 1 one can also cite the work of k t chen who has introduced a chain complex based on iterated integrals that computes the cohomology of free loop spaces over a manifold 10 iterated integrals give a de rham theory for path spaces in particular this theory has found some applications in the algebraic interpretation of index theory on free loop spaces by means of cyclic homology 20 and 22 let us notice that the theory of iterated integrals s also related to algebraic geometry see 26 for a survey more recently the discovery by m chas and d sullivan of a batalin vilko visky structure on the singular homology of these spaces 8 had a deep impact on the subject and has revealed a part of a very rich algebraic struc ture 9 12 the bv structure consists in a loop product which is commutative and associative it can be un derstood as an attempt to perform intersection theory of families of closed curves a loop bracket half of this bracket controls the commutativity up to homotopy at the chain level of the loop product an operator coming from the action of s 1 on the free loop space s 1 acts by reparametrization of the loops m chas and d sullivan use in 8 classical intersection theory of chains in a manifold this structure has also been defined in a purely homotopical way by r cohen and j jones using a ring spectrum structure on a thom spectrum of a virtual bundle over free loop spaces 13 as discovered by s voronov 53 it comes in fact from a geometric operadic action of the cacti operad very recently j klein in 33 has extended the homotopy theoretic approach of r cohen and j jones to poincare duality spaces using a ring spectrum technology in this paper we adopt a different approach to string topology namely we use a geometric version of singular homology introduced by m jakob 28 and we show how it is possible to define gysin morphisms exterior products and intersection type products such as the loop product of m chas and d sullivan in the setting of hilbert manifolds let us point out that three different types of free loop spaces are used in the mathematical literature a bordism approach to string topology 3 spaces of continuous loops 8 for example spaces of smooth loops which are fre chet manifolds but not hilbert man ifolds 6 for some details spaces of sobolev class of loops 34 or 25 these three spaces are very different from an analytical point of view but they are homotopy equivalent for our purpose we deal with hilbert mani folds in order to have a nice theory of transversality the last of maps is the one we use in order to perform such intersection theory we recall in section 2 what is known about transversality in the context of hilbert manifolds we also describe the manifold structure of free loop spaces used by w klingen berg 34 in order to study closed geodesics on riemannian manifolds the cornerstone of all the constructions of the next sections will be the string pull back also used by r cohen and j jones 13 diagram 1 1 in section 2 4 we extend these techniques n sphere spaces and we show how to intersect geometrically families of n sphere in m section 3 is devoted to the introduction and main properties of geometric homology this theory is based upon bordism classes of singular manifolds in this setting families of n sphere inm which are families parametrized by smooth oriented compact manifolds have a clear homological meaning of particular interest and crucial importance for applications to sphere topol ogy is the construction of an explicit gysin morphism for hilbert manifolds in the context of geometric homology section 3 3 this construction does not use any thom spaces and is based on the construction of pull backs for hilbert manifolds such approach seems completely new in this context we want to point out that all the constructions performed in this section work with a generalized homology theory h under some mild assumptions 28 the associated cohomology theory h is multiplicative h satisfies the infinite wedge axioms in section 4 the operator the loop product the loop bracket the in tersection morphism and the string bracket are defined an studied using the techniques introduced in section 2 and 3 this section is also concerned with string topology operations these operations are parametrized by the topological space of reduced sullivan s chord diagrams cf p q g which is closely related to the combinatorics of riemann surfaces of genus g with p incoming boundary components and q outgoing a voronov private com munication suggested to introduce these spaces of diagrams because they form a prop and the cacti appear as a sub operad pushing the work of r cohen and v godin on the cation of sullivan s chord diagrams on free loop spaces further we prove 4 d chataur theorem let lm be the free loop space over a compact d dimensional manifold m for q 0 there exist morphisms n p q g hn cf p q g hom h lm p h d n lm q where 2 2 g p q moreover as these operations are compatible with the gluing of reduced sullivan s diagrams h lm appear as an algebra over this prop as a corollary one recovers the structure of a frobenius algebra on h d lm build in 12 the operator and the loop product of m chas and d sul livan 8 section 5 is to devoted to the extension of the results of the section 4 to n sphere spaces in particular there exists a commutative and associative product on the homology of these spaces the case of 3 sphere spaces is detailed acknowledgments i would like to thank andy baker and martin jakob for their help about infinite dimensional manifolds and geometric homology discussions about string topology with ralph cohen yves fe lix and jean claude thomas and remarks of muriel livernet were also very useful i am also thankful to sasha voronov for a careful reading of a preliminary draft of this paper and for many suggestions i am very grateful to the algebraic topology group of barcelona crm uab and ub for organizing a seminar on this subject this was my main motivation for writing this paper finally i warmly thanks the centre de recerca de matematica for its hospitality 2 infinite dimensional manifolds 2 1 recollections on hilbert manifolds this section is expository we review the basic facts about hilbert manifolds we refer to 39 see also 37 for a general introduction to infinite dimensional manifolds moreover all the manifolds we consider in this paper are hausdorff and second countable we need these conditions in order to consider partitions of unity 2 1 1 differential calculus let e and f be two topological vector spaces there is no difficulty to extend the notion of differentiability of a continuous map between e and f hence let f e f be a continuous map we say that f is differentiable at x e if for any v e the limit dfx v lim t 0 f x tv f x t exists one can define differentials c morphisms diffeomorphisms and so on a bordism approach to string topology 5 2 1 2 hilbert manifolds a topological space x is a manifold modelled on a separable hilbert space e if there exists an atlas ui i i i such that i each ui is an open set of x and x i i ui ii i ui e is an homeomorphism iii i 1 j is a diffeomorphism whenever ui uj is not empty 2 1 3 fredholm maps a smooth map f x y between two hilbert manifolds is a fredholm map if for each x x the linear map dfx txx tf x y is a fredholm operator that is to say if kerdfx and cokerdfx are finite dimensional vector spaces recall that the index of a fredholm map index x z index fx dim kerdfx dim cokerdfx is a continuous map 2 1 4 orientable morphisms a smooth map f x y between two hilbert manifolds is an orientable morphism if it is a proper map the pre image of a compact set is compact which is also fredholm and such that the normal bundle f is orientable for convenience we consider the notion of orientability with respect to singular homology but we could have chosen to work in a much more general setting let us remark that a closed embedding is an orientable morphism if and only if f is finite dimensional and orientable a closed fredholm map is proper by a result of s smale 47 2 1 5 partitions of unity a very nice feature of hilbert manifolds with respect to banach manifolds and other type of infinite dimensional manifolds is the existence of partitions of unity 39 chapter ii 3 for a proof as a consequence mimicking techniques used in the finite dimensional case one can prove that any continuous map f p x from a finite dimensional manifold p to an hilbert manifold x is homotopic to a c one and we can also smoothen homotopies 2 2 transversality we follow the techniques developed by a baker and c o zel in 2 in order to deal with transversality in an infinite dimensional context 2 2 1 transversal maps let f x y and g z y be smooth maps between two hilbert manifolds then they are transverse at y y if df txx dg tzz tyy with f x g z y the maps are transverse if they are tranverse at any point y imf img 6 d chataur 2 2 2 pull backs let us recall the main results about pull backs of hilbert manifolds we consider the following diagram z g f z y x y g f x where z is a finite dimensional manifold and f x y is an orientable map using an infinite dimensional version of the implicit function theorem 39 chapter i 5 one can prove the following result 2 2 3 proposition 2 prop 1 17 if the map f x y is an orientable morphism and g z y is a smooth map transverse to f then the pull back map g f z y x z is an orientable morphism moreover the finite dimensional hypothesis on z enables to prove 2 2 4 theorem 2 th 2 1 2 4 let f x y be an orientable morphism and let g z y be a smooth map from a finite dimensional manifold z then g can be deformed by a smooth homotopy until it is transverse to f 2 3 free loop spaces if we want to do intersection theory with spaces of closed curves we need to consider them as smooth manifolds following 6 chapter 3 one can consider the space c s 1 m of all smooth curves as an inverse limit hilbert manifold but we prefer to enlarge this space and to consider h 1 s 1 m the space of h 1 curves this space has the advantage to be an hilbert manifold with this choice we can apply all the techniques described in the sections 2 1 and 2 2 in fact we could also consider hn sn m the space of hn curves all these spaces are hilbert manifolds and they are also all homotopy equivalent a bordism approach to string topology 7 to the ilh manifold c s 1 m and all these manifolds are homotopy equivalent to the space of continuous maps c 0 s 1 m equipped with the compact open topology 2 3 1 manifold structure in order to define an hilbert manifold structure on free loop spaces we follow w klingenberg s approach 34 let m be a simply connected riemannian manifold of dimension d we set lm h 1 s 1 m the manifold lm is formed by the continuous curves s 1 m of class h 1 it is modelled on the hilbert space lrd h 1 s 1 rd the space lrd can be viewed as the completion of the space c p s 1 rd of piecewise differentiable curves with respect to the norm 1 this norm is defined via the scalar product 1 t t dt t t dt where is the canonical scalar product of rd as s 1 is 1 dimensional we notice that by sobolev s embedding theorem elements of lrd can be repre sented by continuous curves let us describe an atlas u of lm we take c p s 1 m a piece wise differentiable curve in m notice that c p s 1 m h 1 s 1 m and consider the pullback tm tm s 1 m now let t tm be the set of vectors of norm less than the expo nential map exp t m identifies t with an open set of m and induces a map lt lm moreover as tm is a trivial vector bundle because m is 1 connected we fix a trivialization tm s 1 rd this gives a chart lt lr d 2 3 2 remark in fact the manifold structure on lm does not depend on a choice of a particular riemannian metric on m 8 d chataur 2 3 3 the tangent bundle let tm m be the tangent bundle of m the tangent bundle of lm denoted by tlm can be identified with ltm this is an infinite dimensional vector bundle where each fiber is isomorphic to the hilbert space lrd let lm we have tlm tm where tm is the space of sections of the pullback of the tangent bundle of m along this is the space of h 1 vector fields along the curve a trivialization of tm induces an isomorphism tlm lr d the tangent bundle of lm has been studied in 14 and 43 2 3 4 riemannian structure the manifold lm has a natural riemannian metric the scalar product on tlm lr d comes from 1 2 3 5 the s 1 action the circle acts on lm s 1 lm lm by reparametrization t 7 t of course this action is not free it is continuous but not differentiable let lm then the isotropy subgroup is of is s 1 if and only if is a constant map in this case we say that is of multiplicity 0 otherwise it is isomorphic to a finite cyclic group and the multiplicity of the curve is equal to the order of the isotropy subgroup let lm m be the space of curves of multiplicity equal to m this gives an s 1 equivariant partition of lm lm m lm m the space lm 0 can be identified with m and lm 1 is called the space of prime curves 2 3 6 the string pullback let us consider the evaluation map ev 0 lm m 7 0 this is a submersion of hilbert manifolds this follows immediately from the definition of tlm as the map ev 0 ev 0 is transverse to the diagonal map because ev 0 ev 0 is a submersion we can form the string pull back 13 1 1 a bordism approach to string topology 9 lm lm lm m lm m m ev 0 ev 0 m ev by transversality this is a diagram of hilbert manifolds we have lm m lm lm lm 0 0 the map lm m lm lm lm is a closed embedding of codimension d as the normal bundle is the pull back of and as this last one is isomorphic to tm we deduce that is an orientable morphism 2 3 7 families of closed strings a family of closed strings inm is a smooth map f p lm from a compact orientable manifold p the proposition below gives a necessary but not sufficient condition in order to do intersection of families of closed strings 2 3 8 proposition if p q f g lm lm is transverse to then ev 0 f and ev 0 g are transverse in m now we suppose that p f and q g are two orientable compact man ifolds of dimensions p and q respectively moreover we suppose that they are such that f g is transverse to we denote by p q the pullback p q p q lm lm f g lm m lm then p q is a compact orientable submanifold of p q of dimension p q d 10 d chataur 2 3 9 composing loops let us define the map lm m lm lm let be an element of lm m lm then is the curve defined by t 2 t if t 0 1 2 t 2 t 1 if t 1 2 1 we notice that this map is well defined because we compose piecewise dif ferential curves hence no dampening constructions are needed as in 13 remark about construction 1 2 the construction of comes from the co h space structure of s 1 i e the pinching map s 1 s 1 s 1 2 3 10 intersection of families of closed strings now consider two families of closed strings p f and q g by deforming f g one can produce a new family of closed strings p q in m we also notice that the image of lies in lm 0 lm 1 2 3 11 remark all we have done with free loop spaces can be performed for manifolds of maps from a space which is a co h space and a compact orientable manifold to a compact riemannian manifold 2 4 n sphere spaces letm be a n connected d dimensional compact ori ented smooth manifold 2 4 1 definition we call the n sphere space of m and we denote it by snm the space of h n maps from sn to m 2 4 2 remark by sobolev s embedding theorem we know that hn sn m c 0 sn m 2 4 3 theorem snm is an hilbert manifold proof as for free loop spaces an atlas of snm can be given by considering hn vector fields along all maps b sn m then using a trivialization of b tm we deduce that snm is modelled on the separable hilbert space snr d the tangent bundle of snm has the same description as tlm it can be identified with sntm and we have tsnmb b tm moreover snm is a riemannian manifold a bordism approach to string topology 11 2 4 4 the n sphere pull back let fix a base point 0 in sn the evaluation map ev 0 snm m is clearly a submersion of hilbert manifolds then we can form the pull back of hilbert manifolds snm snm snm m snm m m ev 0 ev 0 m ev and the map is an orientable morphism 2 4 5 composing n sphere thanks to the pinching map sn sn sn one can define snm m snm snm 2 4 6 intersection of families of n sphere as for families of closed strings we consider two families of n sphere in m denoted by p f and q g by deforming f g and taking the pullback p q along one can produce a new family of n sphere p q in m 3 geometric homology theories as r thom proved it is not possible in general to represent singular homology classes of a topological space x by singular maps i e continuous maps f p x from an oriented manifold to x but m jakob in 28 29 proves that if we add a cohomological information to the map f a singular cohomological class of p then steenrod s realizability problem with this additional coho mological data has an affirmative answer in these two papers he develops a geometric version of homology this geometric version seems to be very nice to deal with gysin morphisms intersection products and so on all the constructions we give below and also their applications to string topology work out for more general homology theories bordism topologi cal k theory for example we refer the reader to 28 29 and 30 for the definitions of these geometric theories 3 1 an alternative description of singular homology 12 d chataur 3 1 1 geometric cycles let x be a topological space a geometric cycle is a triple p a f where f p x is a continuous map from a compact connected orientable manifold p to x i e a singular manifold over x and a h p z if p is of dimension p and a hm p z then p a f is a geometric cycle of degree p m take the free abelian group generated by all the geometric cycles and impose the following relation p a b f p a f p b f thus we get a graded abelian group 3 1 2 relations in order to recover singular homology we must impose the two following relations on geometric cycles i bordism relation if we have a map h w x where w is an orientable bordism between p f and q g i e w p q let i 1 p w and i 2 q w be the canonical inclusions then for any c h w z we impose p i 1 c f q i 2 c g ii vector bundle modification let p a f be a geometric cycle and consider a smooth orientable vector bundle e p take the unit sphere bundle s e 1 of the whitney sum of e with a copy of the trivial bundle over m the bundle s e 1 admits a section by we denote the gysin morphism in cohomology associated to this section then we impose p a f s e 1 a f an equivalence class of geometric cycle is denoted by p a f let call it a geometric class and h q x is the abelian group of geometric classes of degree q 3 1 3 theorem 28 cor 2 36 the morphism h q x hq x z p a f 7 f a p where p is the fundamental class of p is an isomorphism of abelian groups a bordism approach to string topology 13 3 2 cap product and poincare duality 29 3 2 the cap product be tween h x z and h x is given by the following formula hp x z h q x h q p x u p a f p f u a f let m be a d dimensional smooth compact orientable manifold without boundary then the morphism hp m z h d p m x 7 m x idm is an isomorphism 3 3 gysin morphisms 30 for a finite dimensional version we want to consider gysin morphisms in the context of infinite dimensional manifolds let us recall two possible definitions for gysin morphisms in the finite dimen sional context the following one is only relevant to the final dimensional case let us take a morphism f mm nn of poincare duality spaces then we define f h n n d hn nn f hn mn d 1 h m n m m where d is the poncare duality isomorphism for the second construction if f is an embedding of smooth oriented mani fold then one can apply the pontryagin thom collapse c to the thom space of the normal bundle of f and then apply the thom isomorphism th f h n n c h th f th h m n m m in the infinite dimensional context we can not use poincare duality and to be as explicit as possible we do not want to use the pontryagin thom collapse and the thom isomorphism we prefer to use a very geometrical interpretation of the gysin morphism which is to take pull backs of cycles along the map f so we take i x y an orientable morphism of hilbert manifolds and we suppose that i is d dimensional let us define i h p y h p d x let p a f be a geometric class in h p y we can choose a representing cycle p a f if f is not smooth we know that it is homotopic to a smooth map by the existence of partitions of unity on y moreover we can choose it 14 d chataur transverse to i by the bordism relation all these cycles represent the same class now we can form the pull back p f i p y x y f i x we set i p a f 1 d a p y x f i a the sign is taken from 30 3 2 c the gysin morphism can be viewed as a product for bivariant theories 17 3 4 the cross product 29 3 1 the cross product is given by the pair ing h q x h p y h p q x y p a f q b g 1 dim p b p q a b f g the sign makes the cross product commutative let x y y x be the interchanging morphism then 1 3 5 the intersection product 30 sect 3 let us return to the finite dimensional case and considerm an orientable compact d dimensional man ifold like for gysin morphisms in order to be very explicit we avoid the classical constructions of the intersection product that use either poincare duality or the thom isomorphism let p x f h n 1 m and q y g h n 2 m we suppose that f and g are transverse in m then we form the pull back p q j p m q m m f g m and define the pairing h n 1 m h n 2 m h n 1 n 2 m m h n 1 n 2 d m hence we set p a f q b g 1 d a b dim p b p m q j a b a bordism approach to string topology 15 let l p m q p and r p m q q be the canonical maps then we also have p a f q b g 1 d a b dim p b p m q l a r b with these signs conventions the intersection product makes h d m into a graded commutative algebra p mq l a r b 1 d dim p a d dim q b q mp l b r a 4 string topology in this section using the theory of geometric cycles we show how to recover the bv structure on h lm h d lm z introduced in 8 and studied from a homotopical point of view in 13 we also define the intersection morphism the string bracket of 8 and string topology operations we extend the frobenius structure given in 12 to a homological action of the space of sullivan s chord diagrams remark in this section we use the language of operads and algebras over an operad in order to state some results in a nice and appropriate frame work for definitions and examples of operads and algebras over an operad we refer to 21 23 38 40 41 and 53 4 1 the operator first we define the operator on h lm let us consider a geometric cycle p a f h n d lm we have a map f s 1 p id f s 1 lm lm 4 1 1 definition there is an operator h n d lm h n d 1 lm given by the following formula p a f 1 a s 1 p 1 a f 4 1 2 proposition 8 prop 5 1 the operator verifies 2 0 proof this follows from the associativity of the cross product and the nullity of s 1 s 1 1 1 h 2 s 1 where is the product on s 1 4 2 loop product let us take p a f h n 1 d lm and q b g h n 2 d lm we can smooth f and g and make them transverse to then we form the pull back p q 16 d chataur 4 2 1 definition let l p q p and r p q q be the canonical maps then we have the pairing h n 1 d lm h n 2 d lm h n 1 n 2 d lm p a f q b g 1 d a b dim p b p q l a r b let call it the loop product 4 2 2 proposition 8 thm 3 3 the loop product is associative and com mutative proof the associativity of the loop product follows from the associativ ity of the intersection product the cup product and the fact that is also associative up to homotopy in order to prove the commutativity of we follow the strategy of 8 lemma 3 2 there is a smooth interchanging map lm m lm lm m lm let p a f and q b g be two geometric classes the formula of 8 lemma 3 2 gives an homotopy h so this is also a bordism between p q lm m lm lm and p q lm m lm lm this bordism identifies p q l a r b and p q l a r b which is equal to 1 dim p d a dim p d b q p l b r a 4 3 loop bracket let p a f and q b g be two geometric classes in the preceding section we have defined a bordism between p q lm m lm lm and p q lm m lm lm using the same homotopy one can define another bordism between p q lm m lm lm and p q lm m lm 2 lm composing these two bordisms one obtains a geometric class 1 a b s 1 p q 1 l a r b 1 h a bordism approach to string topology 17 4 3 1 definition the loop bracket is the pairing h n 1 d lm h n 2 d lm h n 1 n 2 d 1 lm p a f q b g 1 d 1 a b dim p b s 1 p q 1 l a r b h there is another way to define the bracket by setting 8 cor 5 3 1 1 together with this bracket h lm is a gerstenhaber algebra 4 3 2 theorem 8 thm 4 7 the triple h lm is a ger stenhaber algebra i h lm is a graded associative and commutative algebra ii the loop bracket is a lie bracket of degree 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 iii 1 1 4 3 3 remark let us recall that there are two important examples of ger stenhaber algebras the first one is the hochschild cohomology of a differential graded asso ciative algebra a hh a a this goes back to m gerstenhaber 18 the second example is the singular homology of a double loop space h 2 x this is due to f cohen 11 both examples are related by the deligne s conjecture proved in many dif ferent ways by c berger and b fresse 7 m kontsevich and y soibelman 36 j mcclure and j smith 42 d tamarkin 49 and s voronov 52 see also m kontsevich 35 this conjecture states that there is a natural action of an operad c 2 quasi isomorphic to the chain operad of little 2 discs on the hochschild cochain complex of an associative algebra hochschild homology enters the theory by the following results of r cohen and j d s jones 13 thm 13 if c m denotes the singular cochains of a manifold m then there is an isomorphism of associative algebras hh c m c m h lm 4 4 the bv structure in 13 and 8 it is proved that h lm is a bv algebra we refer to 19 for bv structures 18 d chataur 4 4 1 theorem 8 th 5 4 the loop product and the operator makes h lm into a batalin vilkovisky algebra we have the following relations i h m s 1 is a graded commutative associative algebra ii 2 0 iii 1 1 is a derivation of each variable the proof of the theorem in the context of geometric homology is given by building explicit bordisms between geometric cycles all these bordisms are described in 8 4 4 2 remark e getzler introduced bv algebras in the context of 2 dimensional topological field theories 19 and he proved that h 2 m is a bv algebra if m has a s 1 action other examples are provided by the de rham cohomology of manifolds with s 1 action the bv structure on h lm comes in fact form a geometric action of the cacti operad 13 53 normalized cacti with spines in the terminology of r kaufmann 34 roughly speaking an element of cacti n is a tree like configuration of n marked circles in the plane the cacti operad is homotopy equivalent to the little framed discs operad 53 and we know since the work of e getzler that the homology of the little framed discs operad gives the bv operad 19 let us explain this geometric action first let us define the space lcacti n m denoted by lkm in 13 as lcacti n m c f c cacti n f c m we take the gysin morphism along a map cacti n lm n lcacti n m to any element c cacti n one can associate a map s 1 c then we get lcacti n m lm for n 1 2 we know from r kaufmann s description of cacti 32 that cacti n is a smooth manifold in that case all the maps defined above are maps of hilbert manifolds and they give also a very nice description of the action of h cacti on h d lm so it is certainly worth building a smooth structure on cacti or on an operad homotopy equivalent that acts in the same way this would give a more conceptual proof of the preceding theorem a bordism approach to string topology 19 4 5 constant strings we have a canonical embedding c m lm c induces a map c h n d m h n d lm the morphism c is clearly a morphism of commutative algebras 4 6 intersection morphism let recall that the map ev 0 lm m is a submersion in fact this is a smooth fiber bundle of hilbert manifolds hence if we choose a base point m m the fiber of ev 0 in m is the hilbert manifold m of based loops in m consider the morphism i m lm from the based loops in m to the free loops in m this is an orientable morphism of codimension d let us describe the intersection morphism i i h lm h m let p a f h n d lm be a geometric class one can define i p a f in two ways i using the gysin morphism i p a f 1 d a p lm m f i a a better way is certainly to notice that this is the same as doing the loop product with cm 1 c where cm is a point and c cm lm is the constant loop space at the point m then we have ii i p a f 1 d a p cm l a we remark that p cm is either empty depending on the dimension of p for example when dimp d or equal to m and if a 0 we also have i p a f 0 4 6 1 proposition 8 prop 3 4 the intersection morphism i is a mor phism of associative algebras proof the algebra structure on h m comes from the pontryagin prod uct which is the restriction of to m m we have the following diagram m m m m m lm m lm i i lm i 20 d chataur the pontryagin product is given by the formula p a f q b g 1 dim p b p q a b m m f g this product is associative but not commutative the intersection mor phism is a morphism of algebras by commutativity of the diagram above this morphism has been studied in details in 16 in particular it is proved that the kernel of i is nilpotent 4 7 bordism and string topology let so x be the bordism group of a topological space x we recall that it is isomorphic to the bordism classes of singular oriented manifolds over x morphism f m x we remark that so lm is also a bv algebra all the constructions de scribed above immediately adapt to so let call a geometric class p a f realizable if it is equivalent to a class q 1 g this is equivalent to condition of being in the image of the steenrod thom morphism st son d lm hn m m f 7 m 1 f this morphism is clearly a morphism of bv algebras and we have 4 7 1 proposition if c 6 im st then i c 0 proof this follows from the fact that if a geometric class is not realiz able via the morphism st it has the form p a f with a 0 and in this case i p a f 0 4 7 2 remark we recall that in general st is neither injective nor sur jective however it is surjective when n d 6 using atiyah hirzebruch spectral sequence one proves that it is an isomorphism for n d 0 1 2 and it is also surjective if we work over f 2 over this field the orientability condition in the definition of geometric homology is unnecessary 4 8 string bracket 4 8 1 the string space let us consider the fibration s 1 es 1 bs 1 there exists a smooth model for this fibration for es 1 we take s the inductive limit of sn by 37 chapter x this is an hilbert manifold modelled on r n as s 1 acts freely and smoothly on s we have a s 1 fiber bundle of hilbert manifolds s 1 s cp we get the s 1 fibration s 1 lm s lm s 1 s a bordism approach to string topology 21 the projection lm s lm is a homotopy equivalence of hilbert manifolds as we know from 15 that an homotopy equivalence between two separable hilbert manifolds is homotopic to a diffeomorphism we deduce that they are diffeomorphic the space lm s 1 s is not an hilbert manifold because the action of s 1 on lm is not smooth let call this space the string space of m 4 8 2 string homology let hi be the homology group h i d lm s 1 s this is the string homology ofm in what follows we give explicit definitions of the morphism c m e of 8 6 the morphism c let e h 2 lm s 1 s be the euler class of the s 1 fibration defined above c hi hi 2 c p a f p f e a f the morphism e this morphism is e e hi lm hi e p a f p a f the morphism m let p a f a geometric class in hi for a point p p we can choose cp u lm s that represents a class cp u lm s 1 s as this choice is non canonical we take all the orbit of cp u under the action of s 1 in this way we produce a map f s 1 p lm s identifying lm s with lm one get a map m hi hi 1 lm m p a f 1 a s 1 p 1 a f we have the following exact sequence which is the gysin exact sequence associated to the s 1 fibration hi lm e hi c hi 2 m hi 1 lm 4 8 3 the bracket the string bracket is given by the formula 1 a e m m together with this bracket h is a graded lie algebra of degree 2 d 8 th 6 1 22 d chataur 4 9 riemann surfaces operations these operations are defined by r cohen and v godin in 12 by means of thom spectra technology let be an oriented surface of genus g with p q boundary components p incoming and q outgoing we fix a parametrization of these components hence we have two maps in p s 1 and out q s 1 if we consider the space of h 2 maps h 2 m we get a hilbert manifold and the diagram of hilbert manifolds lm q out h 2 m in lm p let be the euler characteristic of the surface using sullivan s chord diagrams it is proved in 12 that the morphism h 2 m in lm p has a homotopy model h 2 c m in lm p that is an embedding of hilbert manifolds of codimension d hence by using the gysin morphism for hilbert manifolds one can define the op eration h lm p in h d h 2 m out h d lm q all these operations are parametrized by the topological space of marked metric chord diagrams cf p q g 12 sect 1 in the next section we intro duce a reduced version of sullivan s chord diagrams and give some algebraic properties of the associated operations 4 9 1 sullivan s chord diagrams in the preceding morphism c cf p q g is the sullivan s chord diagram associated to to the surface let us recall the definition of 12 4 9 2 definition a metric marked sullivan chord diagram c of type g p q is a metric fat graph a graph whose vertices are at least trivalent such that the incoming edges are equipped with a cyclic ordering it has the structure of a compact metric space details are given in 12 def 1 and 27 chapter 8 this fat graph represents a surface of genus g with p q boundary compo nents the set of metric fat graphs is denoted by fatp q g the cycling ordering of the edges defines boundary cycles pick an edge and an orientation on it then traverse it in the direction of the orientation a bordism approach to string topology 23 this leads to a vertex at this vertex take the next edge coming from the cy cling ordering and so on then we get a cycle in the set of edges the graph c consists of a union of p parametrized circles of varying radii that represent the incoming boundary components joined at a finite number of points each boundary cycle has a marking this marking correspond to the starting point of a s 1 parametrization fat graphs also called ribbon graphs are a nice combinatoric tool in order to study riemann surfaces 44 45 and 48 following a suggestion of a voronov rather than using the space cf p q g we introduce the space of reduced metric marked sullivan chord diagrams denoted by cf p q g in a sullivan diagram there are ghost edges these are the edges that lie on the p disjoint circles hence there is a continuous map c 7 s c that collapses each ghost edge to a vertex let us notice that s c is also a metric fat graph but it is no more a sullivan s chord diagram and let cf p q g be the image of the space cf p q g has the following properties 4 9 3 proposition let i cf p q g fatp q g be the canonical inclusion then i and are homotope 4 9 4 proposition the space cf p q g is a prop proof the structure of prop is obtained via a gluing procedure by iden tifying an incoming boundary component with an outgoing boundary com ponent this procedure is described at the level of cf p q g in 12 on unreduced diagrams this procedure is not well defined because there is an ambiguity coming from ghost edges this is no more the case at the level of cf p q g 4 9 5 proposition the suboperads cf 1 0 and cf 1 0 are isomorphic to the cacti operad proof this is immediate let us notice that any element in the preimage s 1 c where s cf 1 q 0 cf 1 q 0 is a chord diagram associated to the cactus c as defined in 34 4 9 6 theorem for q 0 we have morphisms n p q g h n cf p q g hom h lm p h d n lm q 24 d chataur proof let us give the construction of n p q g consider an element of h n cf p q g and suppose that is represented by a geometric cycle s g where g s cf p q g and let us define map g m s f s s f map g s m we also have maps in map g m lm p out map g m lm q using 12 lemma 3 we get an embedding of codimension d in p map g m lm p s where p is the canonical projection if this map is an embedding of hilbert manifolds we actually don t know if cf p q g is a manifold we can form the following diagram n 1 np s j n 1 np s lm p s f 1 fp ids in p map g m g out lm q we define n p q in the following way n 1 1 f 1 np p fp n 1 np s 1 p f 1 fp ids n 1 np s j 1 p out g let us define the morphism in a less heuristic and more rigorous way rather than using an hypothetical embedding of hilbert manifolds let use the thom collapse map of 12 lemma 5 g lm p s map g m g where g is an open neighborhood of the embedding in p and let thg be the thom isomorphism thg h map g m g h d map g m a bordism approach to string topology 25 then n p q is defined by n 1 1 f 1 np p fp n 1 np s 1 p f 1 fp ids n 1 np s 1 p g f 1 fp ids out thg n 1 np s 1 p g f 1 fp ids 4 9 7 proposition h lm is an algebra over the prop h cf p q g proof this follows immediately from 12 cor 9 this last result unifies some of the algebraic structure arising in string topol ogy as corollaries we get 4 9 8 corollary if we fix n 0 then the action of homological degree 0 string topology operations induces on h d lm a structure of frobenius algebra without co unit 4 9 9 corollary when restricted to h cf p 1 0 on recovers the bv structure on h d lm induced by the string product and the operator 4 9 10 a conjecture and its consequences we obtain homological string topology operations which are 4 graded 3 gradings being purely geometric p q and g and one grading purely homological we do not know the homotopy type of cf p 1 0 in fact there is a con jecture of r cohen and v godin on the topology of the space cf p q this conjecture states that this space is homotopy equivalent to bm p q g where m p q g is the mapping class group of a riemann surface s of genus g with p q boundary components mp qq 0 diff s where the diffeomorphisms must preserve the boundary components point wise now suppose that this conjecture holds and let fix q 1 since tillmann s 26 d chataur work 50 we know that the space bm p 1 g is an operad bm and that this operad detects infinite loop spaces let be the symmetric operad 3 we have a map of operads bm this last fact has a deep consequence in string topology because if we look at the singular homology of the free loop spaces with coefficients in z pz this conjecture implies the existence of stringy dyer lashof operations coming from the symmetries of the surfaces from the operadic nature of these oper ations they should satisfy cartan and adem relations and these operations should come from an e structure 38 chapter 1 5 n sphere topology let fix an integer n 1 and suppose that m is a n connected compact oriented smooth manifold some results about the algebraic structure of the homology of n sphere spaces were announced in 53 th 2 5 we show how to recover a part of this structure 5 1 sphere product let us take p a f h n 1 d snm and q b g h n 2 d snm two families of n sphere we can smoothen f and g and make them transverse to then we form the pull back p q 5 1 1 definition let l p q p and r p q q be the canonical maps then we have the pairing h n 1 d snm h n 2 d snm h n 1 n 2 d snm p a f q b g 1 d a b dim p b p q l a r b let call it the sphere product 5 1 2 proposition the sphere product is associative and commutative proof the associativity and commutativity of the sphere product follows from the associativity and commutativity of the intersection product the cup product and the fact that is also associative and commutative up to homotopy 5 2 constant spheres we have a canonical embedding c m snm c induces a map c h d m h d snm the morphism c is clearly a morphism of commutative algebras a bordism approach to string topology 27 5 3 intersection morphism let us recall that the map ev 0 snm m is a submersion in fact this is a smooth fiber bundle of hilbert manifolds hence if we choose a base point m m the fiber of ev 0 in m is the hilbert manifold nm of n iterated based loops in m consider the morphism i nm snm this is an orientable morphism of codimension d let us describe the intersection morphism i i h d snm h m let p a f h n d snm be a geometric class one can define i p a f in the following way take the sphere product with cm 1 c where cm is a point and c cm snm is the constant sphere at the point m then we set i p a f 1 d a p cm l a as in the case n 1 we remark we have 5 3 1 proposition the intersection morphism i is a morphism of graded commutative and associative algebras 5 4 3 sphere topology let emphasis on the case n 3 in this case we show the existence of an operator of degree 3 acting on the homology and we also obtain some results about the s 3 equivariant homology of 3 sphere spaces 5 4 1 the operator 3 the sphere s 3 acts on s 3 m let denote this action by hence if we consider a family of 3 sphere in m f p s 3 m we can build a new familly f s 3 p id f s 3 s 3 m s 3 m 5 4 2 definition the operator 3 is given by the following formula 3 h s 3 m h 3 s 3 m p a f 7 1 a s 3 p 1 a f 28 d chataur 5 4 3 proposition the operator verifies 23 0 proof the proof is exactly the same as in the case of the operator and follows from the associativity of the cross product and the nullity of the geometric class s 3 s 3 1 1 5 4 4 3 sphere bracket as in the case n 1 we have a smooth model of the s 3 fibration s 3 es 3 bs 3 which is given by the s 3 fiber bundle of hilbert manifolds s 3 s hp we consider the s 3 fibration s 3 s 3 m es 3 s 3 m s 3 es 3 let h 3 h d s 3 m es 3 and consider the gysin exact sequence of the fibration h i d s 3 m e h 3 i c h 3 i 4 m h i d 1 s 3 m 5 4 5 definifion we define the 3 sphere bracket by the formula 1 e m m 5 4 6 remark this bracket is anti commutative references 1 m ando j morava a renormalized riemann roch
