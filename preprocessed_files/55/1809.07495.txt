general construction of higher homotopy operations in model categories which include classical examples such as long toda brackets and iterated massey products but also cover unpointed operations not usually considered in this context we show how such operations thought of as obstructions to rectifying a homotopy commutative diagram can be defined in terms of a double induction yielding intermediate obstructions as well introduction secondary homotopy and cohomology operations have always played an important role in classical homotopy theory see e g ada bjm mp ps and later p 1 p 2 ald mo sn cw as well as other areas of mathematics see als fgm gl gr ss toda s construction of what we now call toda brackets in t 1 cf t 2 ch i was the first example of a secondary homotopy operation

definition of secondary stable cohomology operations see also ha kristensen gave a description of such oper ations in terms of chain complexes cf kr kk which was extended by maunder and others to n th

more recent years there has been a certain revival of interest in the subject notably in algebraic contexts see for example bk ga s e cf hw in sp 2 spanier gave a general theory of higher order homotopy operations ex tending the definition of secondary operations given in sp 1 special cases of higher order homotopy operations appeared in wa k mo bbg and other general defini tions may be found in bm bjt 2 the last two approaches cited present higher order operations as the last ob struction to rectifying certain homotopy commutative diagrams in spaces or other model categories in particular they highlight the special role played by null maps in almost all examples occurring in practice implicitly they both assume an induc tive approach to rectifying such diagrams however in earlier work no attempt was made to describe a useable inductive procedure which should inter alia explain precisely which lower order operations are required to vanish in order for a higher order

commutative diagram obstructions 1 http arxiv org abs 1809 07495 v 1 2 d blanc m w johnson and j m turner the goal of the present note is to make explicit the inductive process underlying our earlier definitions of higher order operations in as general a framework as possible we hope the explicit nature of this approach will help in future work both to clarify the question of indeterminacy of the higher operations and possibly to produce an algebra of higher operations in the spirit of toda s original juggling lemmas see t 2 ch i an important feature of the current approach is that we assume that our indexing category is directed and we consistently proceed in one direction in rectifying the given homotopy commutative diagram say from right to left in the right justified version as a result when we come to define the operation associated to an indexing category of length n we use as initial data a specific choice of rectification for the right segment of length n 1 this sequence of earlier choices will appear only implicitly in our description and general notation for higher operations but will be made explicit for our long toda brackets see 1 7 4 9 since our higher operations appear as obstructions to rectification they fit into the usual framework of obstruction theory when they do not vanish one must go back along the thread of earlier choices until reaching a point from which one can proceed along a new branch from the point of view of the obstruction theory the important fact is their vanishing or non vanishing see remark 4 9 for the relation to coherent vanishing nevertheless since our higher operations are always described as a certain set of homotopy classes of maps into a suitable pullback at least in some cases it is possible to describe the indeterminacy more explicitly however this would only be a part of the total indeterminacy since the most general obstruction to rectification consists of the union of these sets taken over all possible choices of initial data of length n 1 after a brief discussion of the classical toda bracket from our point of view in section 1 in section 2 a we describe the basic constructions we need associated to the type of reedy indexing categories for the diagrams we consider the changes needed for pointed diagrams are discussed in section 2 b we give our general definition of higher order operations in section 3 it is hard to relate this construction to more familiar examples because it is intended to cover a number of different situations and in particular the less common unpointed version in all cases the total higher operation serves as an obstruction to extending a partial rectification of a homotopy commutative diagram one further stage in the induction in section 4 we provide a refinement of this obstruction to a sequence of intermedi ate steps in an inner induction culminating in the total operation for the given stage in the induction section 5 is devoted to a commonly occurring problem rigidifying a reduced simplicial object in a model category for which the simplicial identities hold only up to homotopy this serves to illustrate how the general unpointed theory works in low dimensions in section 6 we define pointed higher operations which arise when the indexing category has designated null maps and we want to rectify our diagram while simul taneously sending these to the strict zero map in the model category this involves certain simplifications of the general definition as illustrated in the motivating ex amples of long toda brackets and massey products described in section 7 finally in section 8 we make a tentative first step towards a possible algebra of higher operations by showing how we can decompose our pointed higher operations into ordinary long toda brackets for a certain class of fully reduced diagrams a constructive approach to higher homotopy operations 3 in appendix a we review some basic facts in model categories needed in

we start with a review of the classical toda bracket the primary example of a pointed secondary homotopy operation in keeping with tradition we give a left justified description in terms of pushouts although for technical reasons our general approach will be right justified in terms of pullbacks 1 1 left justified toda brackets a classical toda diagram in any pointed model category consists of three compos able maps 1 2 y 3 h y 2 g y 1 f y 0 with each adjacent composite left null homotopic we shall assume that all objects in 1 2 and the analogous diagrams throughout the paper are both fibrant and cofi brant so we may disregard the distinction between left and right homotopy classes to define the associated toda bracket we first change h into a cofibration to avoid excessive notation we do not change the names of h or its target by lemma a 11 we can alter g within its homotopy class to a g to produce a factorization 1 3 y 3 p h y 2 g 0 cof h g 2 y 1 so g h is the zero map not just null homotopic we use i y 2 cy 2 an inclusion into a reduced cone to extend 1 3 to the solid diagram y 3 p h y 2 p g cy 2 p p cof h p g 2 y 3 p p j y 1 i f mg cof g 2 y 0 4 d blanc m w johnson and j m turner where all squares and thus all rectangles are pushouts with cofibrations as indicated in particular y 3 is a model for the reduced suspension of y 3 mg is a mapping cone on g and is a nullhomotopy for f g note that any choice of such a nullhomotopy induces maps y 3 y 0 and mg y 0 with j suppose that for some choice of the map is null homotopic so j 0 then by lemma a 11 we could alter within its homotopy class to such that j 0 whence the pushout property for the lower right square would induce the dotted map cof g 2 y 0 as a consequence choosing f i i f provides a replacement for f in the same homotopy class satisfying f g i g 0 rather than only agreeing up to homotopy 1 4 definition given 1 2 the subset of the homotopy classes of maps y 3 y 0 consisting of all classes for all choices of and g 2 as above forms the toda bracket f g h each such is called a value of f g h and we say that the toda bracket vanishes at y 3 y 0 as above if that is if f g h includes the null map 1 5 remark by what we have shown f g h vanishes if and only if we can vary the spaces y 0 y 3 and the maps f g h within their homotopy classes so as to make the adjacent composites in 1 2 strictly zero rather than just null homotopic in fact by considering the cofiber sequence y 3 y 2 cof h y 3 one can show that f g h is a double coset in the group y 3 y 0 in fact the choices for homotopy classes of a nullhomotopy for any fixed pointed map a b are in one to one correspondence with classes a b see sp 1 1 and thus the contribution of the choices for and g 2 respectively to the value of f g h are given by h y 2 y 0 and f y 3 y 1 respectively the two subgroups 1 6 h y 2 y 0 and f y 3 y 1 of y 3 y 0 are referred to as the indeterminacy of f g h when y 3 is a homotopy cogroup object or y 1 is a homotopy group object the sum of 1 6 is a subgroup of the abelian group y 3 y 0 in any case vanishing means precisely that the well defined class of f g h in the double quotient h y 2 y 0 y 3 y 0 f y 3 y 1 is the trivial element in the quotient set 1 7 remark the right justified definition of our ordinary toda bracket is given in step c of section 7 a below this will depend on a specific initial choice of maps f and g with f g rather than f g and will be denoted by f g h so f g h f g f g h where the union is indexed over those pairs with f and g in the specified homotopy classes a constructive approach to higher homotopy operations 5 the reader is advised to refer to that section for examples of all constructions in sections 3 4 below since the example of our long toda bracket f g h k in section 7 was the template for our more general setup 2 graded reedy matching spaces our goal is now to extend the notions recalled in section 1 of toda diagrams and toda brackets as obstructions to their pointed realization to more general diagrams y j e where e is some complete category eventually a pointed model category 2 a reedy indexing categories since our approach will be inductive we need to be able to filter our indexing category j for which purpose we need the following notions recall that a category is said to be locally finite if each hom set is finite 2 1 definition we define a weak lattice to be a locally finite reedy indexing category j see hir 15 1 equipped with a degree function deg obj j n written x deg x such that j is connected there are only finitely many objects in each degree all non identity morphisms strictly decrease degree and every object maps to at least one of degree zero 2 2 remark note that a weak lattice j has no directed loops or non trivial endo morphisms and x obj j has only idx mapping out of it if and only if x 0 moreover each object is the source of only finitely many morphisms although there may be elements of arbitrarily large degree 2 3 notation for a weak lattice j as above a we denote by jk the full subcategory of j consisting of the objects of degree k with ik jk j the inclusion b for any x obj j in a positive degree j x will denote the full subcategory of j whose objects are those t j with j x t non empty thus x j x and j x j 0 6 by 2 1 c we denote by j xk the full subcategory of j x containing x and all objects under x of degree at most k with ixk j x k j x the inclusion we implicitly assume that x k when we use this notation similarly j xk is the full subcategory of j xk containing all objects other than x d given x k 0 and a functor y j xk 1 e we have maps xk 1 y x j x t t k 1 y t and x k y x j x t t k y t given by y f y x y t into the factor y t indexed by f x t e given y j xk 1 e as above there is a natural generalized diagonal map 2 4 xk j x v v k y v j x s s k j s v v k y v 6 d blanc m w johnson and j m turner mapping to the copy of y v on the right with index x g s f v by projection of the left hand product onto the copy of y v indexed by the composite x fg v followed by idy v 2 5 example consider the following weak lattice j a u s x 88 qqqqqq v 88 qqqqqqq b 99 rrrrrrr w t deg 3 2 1 0 where all subdiagrams commute and the degrees are as indicated then s u s j x 0 x j x 1 x v t w t with j x 2 j and j x 0 is the discrete category with objects s t furthermore we have a u s u s j x 2 v j x 1 v b w t w t 2 6 definition for a weak lattice j as above and any x j of degree k a the comma category x jk x j x k has as objects the morphisms in j from x to objects in jk with maps in x jk given by commutative triangles in j of the form x t s b for any functor y j xk e and k x we define the object m x k y functorial in y to be the limit in e m x k y lim x j x k y where y f x s y s see mc x 3 we often write mxk for m x k y when y is clear from the context c for any slightly larger diagram y j xk e there is a canonical map in e defined using the universal property of the limit mxk y y x m x k y a constructive approach to higher homotopy operations 7 and x k 1 is the composite of m x k with the forgetful map inclusion mxk forget j x t t k y t from the limit to the product so it is closely related to the reedy matching map when k x 1 note that mx 0 is simply a product of entries of degree zero indexed by the set of maps from x to the discrete category j x 0 and m x 0 x 0 when e is a model category y is called reedy fibrant if each mx x 1 y is a fibration the special case k x 1 is the standard reedy matching construction cf hir defn 15 2 3 2 2 7 lemma given a functor y j xk e as above an extension to y j x k e is uniquely determined by a choice of an object y x e together with a map y x mxk y proof recall that there is an adjoint pair given by forgetting and the right kan extension over ikx the fact that i k x is fully faithful implies that the right kan extension restricts back to the original functor hence the term extension moreover mxk y is the formula for the value of the right kan extension ran j x k j x k y at the entry x see mc x 3 thm 1 because of the adjunction y extends y on j xk precisely when there is a natural transformation y ran j x k j x k y restricting to the identity away from x it is thus completely determined by the entry y x mxk y embedding the limit mxk y as usual into j x u u k y u we see that there are two kinds of conditions needed for an element in this product to be in the limit when e is a concrete category a those not involving y s with s k yielding mxk 1 y in the lower left corner of 2 9 b those which do involve y s with s k where the compatibility con ditions necessarily involve objects in degree k since all maps in j lower degree this implies 2 8 lemma if j is a weak lattice and x k 0 a functor y j xk e induces a pullback square 2 9 mxk y y j x s s k y s j x s s k mxk 1 y forget j x t t k y t j x s s k j s v v k y v here xk is the generalized diagonal map of 2 4 and the maps s k on the right given by 2 3 d all have sources in j xk where y f is defined 8 d blanc m w johnson and j m turner proof note that the existence of y suffices to define each component of the diagram in particular y f is defined for each morphism f in j xk and even forms part of the definition of the factors of the right vertical but such maps are not defined for any g x v with v k denote the pullback of the lower right part of the diagram by rxk we first show that rxk induces a cone on x j x k thus inducing a map r x k m x k by the universal property of the limit projecting off to the right for targets of degree k or projecting after moving down followed by the forgetful map for targets of lower degree yields maps y g rxk y s for each g x s in x j x k we must verify that whenever h fg for h x t we have a commutative diagram in e so that y h y f y g if the codomain of g has degree less than k the upper right corner is not involved and commutativity follows from the fact that the map from rxk factors through m x k 1 y in the lower left on the other hand if the codomain of g has degree exactly k then projecting off at the chosen pair g f in the assumed commutative pullback diagram we see that 2 10 rxk y h y g y s y f y t y t commutes by the definition of the generalized diagonal which establishes the cone condition thus the universal property of the limit yields a unique map rxk m x k on the other hand the forgetful map forget mxk j x t t k y t can be split into factors with t k and the factors with t k thereby defining maps to the two corners of the pullback which will make the outer diagram commute by inspection thus there is also a map mxk r x k and the induced cone as above is the standard one so the composite is the identity on mxk finally starting from rxk building the cone as above and then projecting as just discussed recovers the same maps y h as entries so this composite is the identity on rxk as well 2 b pointed graded matching objects higher homotopy operations have traditionally appeared as obstructions to van ishing in a pointed context so we shall need a pointed version of the constructions above 2 11 definition when e is any category with limits such as a model category a pointed object in e is one equipped with a map from the final object or empty limit denoted by the most commonly occurring case is where is a zero object both initial and final in e similarly a pointed map in e is one under this defines the pointed category e which inherits any model category structure on e cf hov 1 1 8 note that there is a canonical zero map also denoted by between any two objects in e a constructive approach to higher homotopy operations 9 2 12 definition we say that a small category j as in 2 1 is a pointed indexing category if the set of morphisms has a partition mor j j j and thus j x t j x t j x t for each x t obj j such that a j x x contains idx if and only if x is a zero object in j b the subsets j x t are absorbing under composition that is if f and g are composable and either of f or g lies in j then so does their composite thus j behaves like a 2 sided ideal and j like the corresponding cosets given e and a pointed weak lattice j that is a pointed indexing category which is also a weak lattice a pointed diagram in e is a functor y j e such that y g whenever g j x t 2 13 example we can make the decreasing poset category j n n n 1 0 pointed by setting j t s j t s whenever t s 1 so only indecomposable maps lie in j a pointed diagram j e is then simply a chain complex in e 2 14 remark making a diagram commute while also forcing certain maps to be zero is more restrictive than simply making it commute thus we would like to construct an analog of mxk tailored to the pointed case note that in a pointed category e there is a canonical map j x t y t for any t hence a section 2 15 j x t y t j x t y t of the projection map 2 16 definition given any diagram y j e where j is a pointed weak lattice define its reduced matching space for x and k as the object of e defined by the pullback m x k y y forget x k mxk y forget j x t t k y t j x t t k y t which also determines the maps xk and forget in effect we have replaced any factor indexed on a map in j by like reducing modulo the ideal j precisely as one would expect for a pointed diagram we then have the following analogues of lemmas 2 7 and 2 8 2 17 lemma given a pointed functor y j xk e a pointed extension to y j xk e is uniquely equivalent to a choice of an object y x together with a morphism in e y x m x k y 10 d blanc m w johnson and j m turner 2 18 lemma if x k 0 a pointed functor y j xk e for j and e as above induces a pullback square 2 19 m x k y y j x s s k y s j x s s k s k m x k 1 y forget j x t t k y t j x s s k j s v v k y v where s k is as in 2 3 and x k is defined by analogy with 2 4 proof follow the proof of lemma 2 8 with j replacing j the absence of factors indexed in j implies that the structure maps y h from the pullback of 2 19 to the copy of y s indexed by h x s is the zero map whenever h j so the result follows from the absorbing property of j from the two lemmas we have 2 20 corollary any pointed diagram y j xk e induces a structure map mxk y x m x k for each x k 0 2 21 definition if e is a model category and j is a pointed weak lattice a pointed diagram y j e is called pointed reedy fibrant if each map m x x 1 is a fibration 2 22 lemma if e is a model category and j is a pointed weak lattice a pointed diagram y j e which is reedy fibrant in the sense of 2 6 is also pointed reedy fibrant moreover for any pointed reedy fibrant y m x k y is fibrant in e for each k proof let k x 1 and consider a lifting square for mxk with respect to an acyclic cofibration extend the diagram to include mxk c y x mx k mx k d m x k x k mxk note that a lift in the outer distorted square will serve as a lift for the inner square since xk is a base change of another monomorphism so is itself monic to show that m x k y is fibrant in e whenever y is pointed reedy fibrant we adapt the argument of lemma 15 3 9 2 through corollary 15 3 12 2 of hir as follows given a lifting diagram in e 2 23 c m x n d h a constructive approach to higher homotopy operations 11 we construct the dotted lift by induction on 0 k n for a pointed reedy fibrant object we assume the zero entries are each fibrant so their product m x 0 will also be fibrant for the induction step suppose we have a lift in the diagram 2 24 c m x n m x k 1 d h 1 66 note that the structure for any f x s with s k induces a commutative diagram 2 25 m x k 1 y s m s k 1 so in the new lifting diagram 2 26 c m x n y s d hf 66 m s k 1 combining the previous two the lift hf exists because y was assumed to be pointed reedy fibrant all of these maps together define h 0 d y s compatibility with lower degree pieces then implies that h 0 factors through the limit defining m x k which completes our induction step showing that m x n is fibrant in e 2 27 lemma each pointed diagram z has a pointed reedy fibrant replacement y which is weakly equivalent to its reedy fibrant replacement y as an unpointed diagram proof in the following commuting diagram z x m x k z m x k y mxk z mxk y factor the top horizontal composite as an acyclic cofibration z x y x followed by a fibration y x m x k y a lift in the diagram z x y x y x 44 m x k y mxk y will allow us to construct inductively a weak equivalence between the new diagram y and the standard reedy fibrant replacement y for z 12 d blanc m w johnson and j m turner 3 general definition of higher order operations from now on e will be a model category and we assume given a homotopy commutative diagram in e that is a functor y j ho e with j as in 2 1 our higher homotopy operations will serve as obstructions to rectification of such a y that is lifting it to y j e we may assume for simplicity that each y s is both cofibrant and fibrant which can always be arranged without altering any homotopy types see 3 2 3 1 the double induction we attempt to construct the rectification y by a double induction i in the outer induction we assume we have succeeded in finding a functor yn jn e yn is assumed to be reedy fibrant realizing y jn in fact for our induction step it suffices to assume only the existence of y n 1 jn 1 ho e extending yn ii by the reedy conditions lifting y n 1 to yn 1 jn 1 e extending yn is equivalent to extending the latter to a point wise extension y xn j x n e for each x obj j of degree n 1 separately given such an x the restriction of yn produces a diagram yk j x k e for each k n and the restriction of y n 1 produces a diagram y xk j x k ho e with the two remaining compatible thus for our inner induction hypothesis assume a pointwise extension of yk 1 at x agreeing with appropriate restrictions of both of these has been chosen so y xk 1 j xk 1 e our inner induction step then asks if it is possible to lift y x k to y xk j x k e strictly extending both y x k 1 and yk with the final case of the inner induction being k n notice our inner induction step is equivalent to making coherent choices for each homotopy class of maps out of x to an object of degree k leaving all maps not involving x so those from yk or maps into objects of lower degree so those from y xk 1 unchanged by lemma 3 3 below we may start the inner induction with y x 0 defined by the values on objects of y x 0 the assumption that yn is reedy fibrant implies that y 1 is reedy fibrant too which will allow us to use the homotopy pullback property to extend y x 0 to y x 1 the general step in the inner induction will use lemma 2 8 by assumption we have a map into the lower left corner of 2 9 which we want to extend to a map into the upper left corner still representing the appropriate class required by y xk 3 2 remark our induction assumption that the diagram yn is reedy fibrant implies that yn t is fibrant in e for each t obj jn and the same will hold for the pullbacks that we consider below see e g 3 13 we will assume in addition that in the inner induction for each x obj j y xn x is cofibrant in e together this will ensure that the left and right homotopy classes appearing in various results from the appendix coincide cf hov 1 2 6 and the distinction can thus be disregarded theorem 4 24 then yields an obstruction theory for this step in the inner induction 3 3 lemma in the setup described in 3 1 given x obj j with x 0 a any choice of representatives for a homotopy commutative y x 0 j x 0 ho e provides a lift y x 0 j x 0 e a constructive approach to higher homotopy operations 13 b any reedy fibrant y 1 j x 1 e as above has a pointwise extension to a functor y x 1 j x 1 e which lifts y x 1 proof for a note that j x 0 has no non trivial compositions by definition for b consider the pullback diagram 3 4 y x mx 1 mx 0 y 1 p mx 1 y 1 y j x s s 1 y s ms 0 y 1 mx 0 y x 0 j x t t 0 y t j x s s 1 j s v v 0 y v where the right vertical is a fibration being a product of fibrations by the reedy fibrancy assumption this is a special case of 2 9 where the forgetful inclusion map on the lower left is the identity since j x 0 is discrete note that the outer diagram commutes up to homotopy since it simply compares composites representing maps in y x 1 in a somewhat unusual presentation by lemma a 5 we can then alter the dashed map y 1 within its homotopy class to obtain the dotted map mx 1 into m x 1 equivalently by lemma 2 7 one can find a representative of y x 1 extending to j x 1 without altering the restriction to j x 1 although this may not be the original y x 1 since we might have altered y 1 within its homotopy class when applying lemma a 5 3 5 remark using lemma 3 3 we shall henceforth assume that in the inner induction we may start with k 1 in order to ensure reedy fibrancy for k 1 we factor mx 1 y x m x 1 as an acyclic cofibration y x y x followed by a fibration m x 1 y x m x 1 we must verify that y x and m x 1 may be chosen in such a way that the maps to the other objects y s with s 1 have the correct homotopy type however by assumption all such objects y s are fibrant so we can use the left lifting property for y x y s y x 77 to ensure that and have the same homotopy class in the inner induction on k we build up the diagram under the fixed x obj j by extending y xk 1 to objects in degree k using 3 6 lemma assume x k given y xk 1 j x k 1 e and s k any g j x s induces a map g y x msk 1 14 d blanc m w johnson and j m turner proof given g the diagram y xk 1 induces a cone on s j x k 1 sending f s v to the value of y xk 1 at the target of fg moreover given a morphism s f f v h u in s j xk 1 precomposition with g yields x fg f g v h u which commutes in j that is a morphism in j xk 1 applying y x k 1 yields a commutative diagram in e showing that we have a cone and thus a map g to the limit 3 7 corollary combining all maps g of lemma 3 6 a functor y xk 1 j x k 1 e induces a natural map k 1 y x j x s s k m s k 1 3 8 definition a pullback grid is a commutative diagram tiled by squares where each square hence each rectangle in the diagram is a pullback next we embed the maps k 1 and m x k 1 in a pullback grid in order to apply lemma 2 8 3 9 lemma assuming x n k 2 any functor y xk 1 j x k 1 e induces a pullback grid defined by the lower horizontal and right vertical maps with the natural dashed maps into the pullbacks 3 10 y x k 1 k 1 k 1 p mx k 1 nxk 1 y qk 1 qxk 1 y u v j x s s k m s k 1 forget mxk 1 forget j x t t k y t j x s s k j s v v k y v proof to verify commutativity of the outer diagram note that for each composable pair x g s f v in j the projection of either composite from y x onto the copy of y v indexed by g f in the lower right corner is y fg by definition we now set the stage for our obstruction theory by combining all of these pieces in a single diagram a constructive approach to higher homotopy operations 15 3 11 proposition assuming x n k 2 any functor yk j x k e as in 3 1 induces maps into a pullback grid 3 12 y x mx k 1 k 1 k 1 x k x k y x k mx k k mxk y pxk y pk 1 rk j x s s k y s ms k 1 nxk 1 y qk 1 qxk 1 y u v j x s s k m s k 1 forget mxk 1 forget j x t t k y t j x s s k j s v v k y v here xk x k y x k only makes the outermost diagram commute up to homotopy furthermore the map mxk exists after altering x k within its homotopy class if and only if there is a map k such that pk 1 k k 1 and rk k x k proof the outer pullback is mxk by lemma 2 8 and the fact that m s k 1 followed by the inclusion forget is s k cf 2 3 note that the lower half of the grid involves only objects of j in degrees k so the fact that yk agrees with y x k 1 j x k 1 e implies that k 1 and k 1 exist by lemma 3 9 the outer diagram commutes up to homotopy because yk j xk 1 agrees with y xk 1 and lifts y x k which is homotopy commutative since the upper left square is a pullback producing a lift of k 1 y x n x k 1 to mxk is equivalent to choosing a lift of k 1 y x q x k 1 to k y x p x k with pk 1 k k 1 qk 1 k 1 the fact that we only alter xk within its homotopy class ensures that rk k x k with the left hand side serving as the replacement for the right hand side 3 13 remark the problem here is that even though the two maps from y x into j x s j s v y v in the lower right corner of 3 12 agree up to homotopy this need not hold for the two maps into j x s m s k 1 the middle term on the right thus we cannot simply apply lemma a 5 to work with just the upper half of 3 12 in connection with remark 3 2 one should note that all three of the objects along the right vertical edge of 3 12 are fibrant in e the top and bottom objects are products of entries we assumed were fibrant however the middle object is a product of the usual reedy matching spaces for the factors in the product above so by hir cor 15 3 12 2 our assumption of reedy fibrancy implies these factors are also fibrant lemma 2 22 implies that this holds in the pointed case too 16 d blanc m w johnson and j m turner 3 14 the total higher homotopy operation following our inner induction hypothesis as in 3 1 ii assume given y xk j x k ho e y x k 1 j x k 1 e and a reedy fibrant yk j x k e factor the generalized diagonal map xk of 2 4 as a trivial cofibration j x t y t f 1 followed by a fibration f 1 j x s j s v y v if we want a canonical choice of f 1 we will use the product of free path spaces for the non zero factors appearing in the target and the reduced path space for each zero factor see 2 b with defined by the constant paths for non zero factors we then pull back the right vertical maps of 3 12 to produce the following pullback grid with fibrations indicated as usual by 3 15 y x k 1 x k x k y x k k x k x k y x k 1 pxk y pk 1 w f 3 y r k j x s s k y s ms k 1 s k qxk 1 y u f 2 y q s j x s s k m s k 1 forget j x t t k y t 22 f 1 j x s s k j s v v k y v where the outermost diagram commutes up to homotopy and the map k 1 exists by lemma 3 9 in order to construct a lift y xk j x k e by proposition 3 11 we need to produce the dotted map k with pk 1 k k 1 and rk k r k w k x k the problem is that the large square is a strict pullback but not a homotopy pullback so the outermost diagram commuting up to homotopy is not enough however the top left square is a pullback over a fibration so by lemma a 5 producing k is equivalent to finding a map with k 1 and r k x k moreover lemma a 5 applies to the right vertical rectangle which implies that choosing is equivalent to finding a map in the same homotopy class as the com posite x k making the outer diagram commute thus the only question is whether the two composites y x f 2 agree that is given with the map induced by for which necessarily r k x k is it true that k 1 3 16 definition we define the total higher homotopy operation for x to be the set y xk 1 of all homotopy classes of maps y x f 2 with q x k and s k x k we say that y x k 1 vanishes at such a y x f 2 if also k 1 and we say that y x k 1 vanishes if it vanishes at some or equivalently if this subset of the homotopy classes contains the specified class k 1 a constructive approach to higher homotopy operations 17 3 17 remark by corollary a 10 and the fact that forget is a monomorphism the homotopy classes making up y xk 1 are precisely those of the form for a with r k x k and q x k we may apply corollary a 10 to the right vertical rectangle with horizontal fibrations since by assumption the outer diagram commutes up to homotopy this implies that the subset y xk 1 of definition 3 16 is non empty i e some such and so some and in turn some exist thus the total higher homotopy operation is defined at this point the total higher homotopy operation vanishes if there is such a with k 1 this somewhat incongruous terminology of vanishing is explained by the follow ing 3 18 proposition assume given y j ho e with j a weak lattice and x obj j with x n k 2 and let yk j x k e y x k 1 and y x k be as in 3 1 we can then extend yk to y x k j x k e if and only if y x k 1 vanishes proof note that forget is a monomorphism since the class of monomorphisms is closed under categorical products and the inclusion of a limit into the underlying product is always a monomorphism thus the last statement in corollary a 10 implies each value of y xk 1 satisfies for some with r k x k and q x k as a consequence if we assume y x k 1 vanishes at then there is a choice of which satisfies k 1 after possibly altering and so and r k within their homotopy classes by lemma a 5 applied to the upper left square in 3 15 we then have a dotted map k with pk 1 k k 1 replacing xk with r k we still have the same homotopy commutative diagram since moreover if we disregard the dashed arrows and the remaining solid diagram commutes on the nose since q q k 1 x k s k 1 s msk 1 r k and the lower right square commutes by construction the upper left pullback square in 3 12 then yields mxk and so defines the required extension y xk j x k e by lemma 2 7 on the other hand if y xk 1 does not vanish then no choice of yields a map with k 1 thus k 1 does not lift over pk 1 so no such map m x k exists thus there is no extension y xk by lemma 2 7 3 19 remark as a consequence of proposition 3 18 our total higher homotopy op erations are the obstructions to extending a certain choice of representative of a k truncation of a homotopy commutative diagram in order to produce a k 1 truncated representative as in any obstruction theory if the obstruction does not vanish at a certain stage we must backtrack and reconsider earlier choices to see whether by altering them we can make the new obstruction vanish at the stage in question it is natural to ask more generally whether there is any k 1 truncated strict representative of the given homotopy commutative diagram rephrasing this in our context we ask whether for any choice of a k truncated representative our ob struction sets contain the particular class which constitutes vanishing in those cases where one can identify the ambient collections of homotopy classes of maps with one another a positive answer to the more general question is equivalent to that particular class lying in the union of our obstruction subsets 18 d blanc m w johnson and j m turner 4 separating total operations at this level of generality we cannot expect proposition 3 18 to be of much help in practice its purpose is to codify an obstruction theory for rectifying certain homotopy commutative diagrams using the double induction described in 3 1 we now explain how to factor the right vertical map of 3 12 or 3 15 as a composite of mostly fibrations with a view to decomposing the obstruction y xk 1 into more tractable pieces a key tool will be the following 4 1 the separation lemma assume given a solid commutative diagram as follows y x f k 1 1 2 3 p k 1 p 0 pxk y pk 1 f k 1 k 1 x k y k 1 f 3 k 1 x k y u 3 f 2 k 1 x k y u 2 f 1 k 1 x k y s u 1 f 0 k 1 x k qxk 1 k k 1 3 2 1 f k 1 k x k y rk 1 f 3 k x k y f 2 k x k y f 1 k x k y f 0 k x k z f k 1 k 1 x k f 3 k 1 x k y f 2 k 1 x k y f 1 k 1 x k y f 0 k 1 x k f 3 3 x k q 3 f 2 3 x k y r 2 p 2 f 1 3 x k y f 0 3 x k f 2 2 x k q 2 f 1 2 x k y r 1 p 1 f 0 2 x k f 1 1 x k q 1 f 0 1 x k in which all rectangles are pullbacks the indicated maps are fibrations the objects f 0 1 x k and f j k 0 k are fibrant and the vertical map z is a monomorphism note that as a consequence all objects in the diagram other than possibly pxk and qxk 1 are fibrant while all vertical maps f j k x k f j k 1 x k are monomorphisms denote the horizontal composite qxk 1 f 1 k x k by k 1 and the vertical composite f j k 1 x k f j j 1 x k by j so k 1 k 1 and also define k to be the identity on qxk 1 with qk k in addition let j denote the vertical composite f j k 1 x k f j j 2 x k now assume that we also have a map 0 y x f 0 k 1 x k such that 0 0 q 1 1 k 1 then by lemma a 5 applied to the right vertical rectangle with a constructive approach to higher homotopy operations 19 horizontal fibrations there exists 1 with u 1 1 0 and r 1 1 1 1 k 1 we are interested in decomposing the question of whether s 1 k 1 k 1 into a series of smaller questions this question will become important once we demonstrate it to be an instance of asking for a total higher homotopy operation to vanish if it is true that q 2 2 k 1 1 1 then lemma a 5 for the next vertical rectangle imply the existence of the dashed map 2 such that u 2 2 1 and r 2 2 2 2 k 1 proceeding in this manner and assuming the maps into the indicated staircase terms remain homotopic even though we are only certain they agree up to homotopy after applying the relevant rj one produces k 1 such that uk 1 k 1 k 2 and rk 1 k 1 k 1 rk 1 k 1 k 1 k 1 k 1 since k 1 k 1 the final step is then to ask whether k 1 k 1 qk k k 1 k k 1 and if so it follows by composing with most of the rectangle across the top of the diagram that s 1 k 1 k 1 in fact we will be able to characterize when this procedure is possible in terms of obstructions which we will view as separated versions of the total higher homotopy operation corresponding to the original question 4 2 separation lemma given the pullback grid as indicated above along with a choice of 0 satisfying 0 0 q 1 1 k 1 there exists the indicated 1 satisfying u 1 1 0 and r 1 1 1 1 then 1 also satisfies the constraint k 1 k 1 s 1 if and only if there exists an inductively chosen sequence of maps j y x f j k 1 x k for 1 j k starting with the given 1 satisfying 4 3 qj 1 j 1 k 1 j j and j 1 uj j the reader should note that with our conventions in the final case j k 1 the conclusion is that k k 1 k 1 k 1 4 4 corollary if either of the two equivalent conditions of lemma 4 2 holds then by changing 1 y x f 1 k 1 x k within its homotopy class and so using its image under u 1 to replace 0 within its homotopy class as well but without altering k 1 we can lift k 1 to the dotted map f y x p x k shown in the diagram proof of corollary 4 4 this follows from lemma a 5 since the long horizontal rec tangle across the top of the diagram is a pullback over a vertical fibration 4 5 remark in the case we have in mind f 0 1 x k will be a product of objects y s as will f 0 k 1 x k this time with s k and f 0 k x k will be the corresponding product of matching objects msk 1 which will be fibrant by hir cor 15 3 12 2 later we will also have a pointed version instead relying on pointed reedy fibrancy and lemma 2 22 note that the second vertical map in each column of the grid is not required to be a fibration but instead a monomorphism recall that monomorphisms are closed under base change and forgetting from a limit to the underlying product is always a monomorphism so its first factor in any factorization must also be a monomorphism hence these conditions will arise naturally in our cases of interest proof of lemma 4 2 we will repeatedly apply lemma a 5 using a vertical rectangle with horizontal fibrations with j 1 as p and j k 1 as f showing j exists and satisfies 4 6 rj j j j k 1 20 d blanc m w johnson and j m turner provided that 4 7 j 1 j 1 qj j k 1 since 1 exists by the assumption on 0 which is really 4 7 for j 1 we begin the induction by assuming 1 satisfies 4 7 for j 2 in which case 2 exists and satisfies 4 6 for j 2 now assuming the stricter condition 4 7 for j 3 implies the existence of 3 satisfying 4 6 for j 3 and so on when our induction constructs k 1 satisfying 4 6 for j k 1 we assume the stricter condition 4 7 for j k which as noted above is the statement that k k 1 k 1 k 1 however then composing with the horizontal rectangle across the top of the diagram from k 1 to s implies the constraint k 1 k 1 s 1 on the other hand if 1 satisfies the constraint k 1 k 1 s 1 then we proceed by applying lemma a 5 inductively to each square along the top of the diagram using j 1 for p and k k 1 followed by the composite f k 1 k x k f j k x k for f exploiting the horizontal fibrations in the rectangle this yields j satisfying more than 4 7 since the homotopy relation is satisfied up in f j k x k and this also implies 4 6 by construction given y xk j x k ho e y x k 1 j x k 1 e and a reedy fibrant yk j x k e as in 3 1 ii assume that we can refine diagram 3 15 used to define y xk 1 the total higher homotopy operation for x to a pullback grid as in lemma 4 2 then f 0 k 1 x k s k j x s y s and f 0 1 x k s k v k j x s j s v y v in conformity with remark 4 5 while one of the two equivalent conditions in lemma 4 2 is the vanishing of the total higher homotopy operation recall the vertical composite f j k 1 x k f j j x k in this diagram is the composite rj j 4 8 definition if we can produce a pullback grid as in lemma 4 2 refining diagram 3 15 then for each 1 j k the associated separated higher homotopy operation for x of order j 1 denoted by y xk 1 j 1 is the set of homotopy classes of maps y x f j j 1 x k such that if j k 1 rj j k 1 and pj equals the composite y x j f j k 1 x k j f j j 2 x k or if j k 1 rk 1 k 1 k 1 and qk 1 rk 1 rk 2 k 1 k 2 using the notation of the top two rows of vertical arrows in 4 1 we say that y xk 1 j 1 vanishes at y x f j j 1 x k as above if qj 1 j 1 k 1 in the notation of the lemma and we say it vanishes if it vanishes at some value note that if we assume qj j k 1 j 1 j 1 then by lemma a 5 j exists while y xk 1 j 1 can then be defined and by corollary a 10 each j 1 will satisfy j 1 j j thus the vanishing of some value j 1 becomes equivalent to assuming qj 1 j 1 k 1 j j in other words the vanishing of y x k 1 j 1 scilicet at some map j 1 is a necessary and sufficient condition for y xk 1 j 2 to be defined for comments on coherent vanishing see remark 4 9 4 9 remark those familiar with other definitions of higher homotopy operations may have expected a stricter coherent vanishing condition in order for a subsequent a constructive approach to higher homotopy operations 21 operation to be defined however this need not be made explicit in our framework as it is a consequence of compatibility with previous choices for example our version of the ordinary toda bracket denoted by f g h is the obstruction to having a given 2 truncated commuting diagram satisfying just f g extending to a 3 truncated diagram simply by altering h within its homotopy class to satisfy g h without altering g or f each choice of 2 truncation of which there is at least one by lemma 3 3 has an obstruction which is a subset of the homotopy classes of maps y 3 y 0 the usual toda bracket is the union of these subsets f g h f g h thus the more general existence question has a positive answer i e a vanishing toda bracket exactly when for some choice of 2 truncation the obstruction vanishes in our sense when defining our long toda brackets say f g h k we will begin by building the 3 truncation only if the front bracket f g h vanishes for some choice of 2 truncation and we make an appropriate choice of h at that point we only consider values of the back bracket g h k which use the previously chosen maps g and h thus asking that our obstruction vanish is automatically a kind of coherent vanishing if it does not vanish we must alter our choice of 3 truncation until we obtain a coherently vanishing back bracket once again one interpretation of the traditional long toda bracket would then be a union f g h k this time indexed over all possible strict rectifications of f g h so all such 3 truncations 4 10 applying the separation lemma by proposition 3 18 a necessary and sufficient condition for the inner induction step in 3 1 is the vanishing of the total higher homotopy operation y xk 1 that is by lemma 2 7 the existence of a suitable map mxk in 3 12 according to proposition 3 11 this in turn is equivalent to having a map in 3 15 satisfying a certain homotopy commutativity requirement in order to apply lemma 4 2 we need to break up the lower right square of 3 15 into a pullback grid which then induces a horizontal decomposition of the upper right square this will be done by decomposing the lower right vertical map which is a product over j x s with s k of the forgetful maps msk 1 j s v y v with v k 1 the target of this forgetful map can be further broken up as in 2 9 to a product over v k 1 and one over v k 1 4 11 example when s 3 we factor the top horizontal arrow in 2 9 as a weak equivalence followed by a fibration 4 12 ms 2 f 1 3 s 2 j s v v 2 y v similarly we can factor the map in 3 10 from ns 1 to the product of lower degree copies of y t to produce a factorization 4 13 ms 2 n s 1 g 1 3 s 2 j s t t 2 y t 22 d blanc m w johnson and j m turner for the lower degree forgetful map in 2 9 together these yield a factorization of the full forgetful map 4 14 ms 2 f 1 3 s 2 g 1 3 s 2 j s v v 3 y v with the second map a fibration and the first necessarily a monomorphism since the composite is a monomorphism as the inclusion of a limit into the underlying product precomposing with structure maps y s ms 2 which are fibrations because we assumed our diagram y was reedy fibrant yields 4 15 j x s s 3 y s j x s s 3 m s 2 j x s s 3 f 1 3 s 2 g 1 3 s 2 j x s s 3 j s v v 2 y v this is a refinement of the right column in 3 15 in which all but the second map is a fibration and that second map is a monomorphism taking 4 15 as the right column in the diagram of lemma 4 2 we pull it back along the bottom row of 3 15 to get the two right columns of the intended diagram as shown in 4 16 for the next column note that the two maps out of qx 2 in 3 15 induce a map qx 2 f 1 2 x 3 in the notation of 4 16 factoring this as an acyclic cofibration followed by a fibration q x 2 f 2 2 x 3 f 1 2 x 3 and taking pullbacks yields the required pullback grid 4 16 px 3 y p 2 f 2 4 x 3 y f 1 4 x 3 y j x s s 3 y s qx 2 f 2 3 x 3 y f 1 3 x 3 y j x s s 3 m s 2 f 2 2 x 3 f 1 2 x 3 y j x s s 3 f 1 3 s 2 g 1 3 s 2 j x t t 3 y t f 1 1 x 3 j x s s 3 j s v v 3 y v note that f 1 1 x 3 is the f 1 of definition 3 16 while f 1 3 x 3 is f 2 that is the target of our total higher operation separation lemma 4 2 tells us that this operation vanishes precisely when the following two separated operations vanish a the first landing in f 1 2 x 3 being defined by the two composite maps from y x a constructive approach to higher homotopy operations 23 b the vanishing of the first yields a second map into f 2 3 x 3 where this second map defines the values of the second of the separated operations and the formally defined first map defines the possible vanishing of such operations this example is indicative of the general pattern described by 4 17 lemma assume given y xk j x k ho e y x k 1 j x k 1 e and a reedy fibrant yk j x k e as in 3 1 ii if for each m s k 1 we have a pullback grid as in lemma 4 2 these induce a pullback grid 4 18 pxk y pk 1 f k 1 k 1 x k y f k 2 k 1 x k y f 1 k 1 x k y j x s s k y s qxk 1 f k 1 k x k y f k 2 k x k y f 1 k x k y j x s s k m s k 1 f k 1 k 1 x k f k 2 k 1 x k y f 1 k 1 x k y j x s s k f k 2 k s k 1 g k 2 k s k 1 f 1 2 x k y j x s s k f 1 k s k 1 g 1 k s k 1 j x t t k y t f 1 1 x k j x s s k j s v v k y v suitable for lifting k 1 y x q x k 1 to p x k note that the two top right slots in 4 18 are consistent with remark 4 5 proof we prove the lemma by induction on k beginning with 4 16 for k 3 we start with a decomposition 4 19 msk 1 f k 2 k s k 1 f 2 k s k 1 f 1 k s k 1 j s v v k 1 y v of the top map in 2 9 where all but the first map are fibrations this first map is a monomorphism since the composite is such being the inclusion of a limit into the underlying product this is generated using step k 1 in the induction by precomposing the top row in 4 18 for k 1 with the map msk 1 p s k 1 of 3 12 for nsk 1 q s k 1 s k m s k 1 the middle row of 3 12 we pull back the right column of 4 18 for k 1 along the generalized diagonal of 2 4 to 24 d blanc m w johnson and j m turner obtain a sequence of pullbacks 4 20 g j k s k 1 y j s v v k 1 f j k 1 v k 2 g j k 1 v k 2 j s t t k 1 y t j s v v k 1 j v u u k 1 y u for each 1 j k 3 where the right vertical map is a fibration by the induction assumption for j k 2 we instead factor the composite of the top row in 4 21 nsk 2 qk 2 i qsk 2 g k 3 k s k 1 g k 2 k s k 1 r 77 77 into an acyclic cofibration i followed by a fibration r as shown where the top maps are those of 3 12 and 4 18 for k 1 respectively precomposing this with the map msk 1 n x k 2 of 3 12 and then taking products as in example 4 11 yields the desired factorization of the forgetful map 4 22 m s k 1 f k 2 k s k 1 g k 2 k s k 1 f 2 k s k 1 g 2 k s k 1 f 1 k s k 1 g 1 k s k 1 j s v v k y v now factor the next generalized diagonal xk 1 as an acyclic cofibration followed by a fibration p 1 1 f 1 1 x k j s v v k y v pulling back the tower 4 22 along p 1 1 yields the second column on the right in our new grid 4 18 the total higher operation will then land in the twice boxed pullback object f 1 k x k to construct the j th column from the right j 2 with entries f j 1 x k factor the previously defined map qxk 1 f j j 1 x k as an acyclic cofibration qxk 1 f j 1 j 1 x k followed by a fibration p f j 1 j 1 x k f j j 1 x k we then pull back the j 1 st column along p to form the j th column of 4 18 note that upon completion of this process the map qxk 1 f k 1 k x k need not be a fibration but the vertical maps in the upper left square are fibrations by successive base change from the product of maps y s msk 1 each of which is a fibration by reedy fibrancy of yk 4 23 definition the diagram of lemma 4 2 when constructed inductively as in lemma 4 17 will be called a separation grid for yk combining lemma 4 17 with the separation lemma 4 2 and corollary 4 4 yields the following refinement of proposition 3 18 a constructive approach to higher homotopy operations 25 4 24 theorem assume given y xk j x k ho e y x k 1 j x k 1 e and a reedy fibrant yk j x k e as in 3 1 ii for x n k 2 then our total higher homotopy operation separates into a sequence of k 1 obstructions and the following are equivalent 1 a further extension to y xk j x k e exists 2 the total operation y xk 1 vanishes 3 the associated sequence y xk 1 j 1 1 j k of separated higher homotopy operations of 4 8 vanish so in particular each in turn is defined 4 25 remark the machinery of the separated higher homotopy operations has been formulated to agree with long toda brackets in pointed cases we shall deal with these in section 7 after a more detailed study of the special issues involving pointed diagrams in particular the role of qxk 1 will be played by a point so the weak equivalence followed by a fibration factorizations out of it will be provided by taking reduced path objects on the target however we first present a simple example of the less familiar general unpointed situation before focusing on the details for the pointed situation 5 rigidifying simplicial diagrams up to homotopy a commonly occurring instance of a homotopy commutative diagram which needs to be rectified are restricted co simplicial objects also known as simplicial objects i e without co degeneracies examples appear in bjt 1 6 bjt 3 4 1 b 2 5 and implicitly in may se pr and more we now show how the double inductive approach described in 3 1 applies to such diagrams we denote the objects of the simplicial indexing category by 0 1 n with the value of y e at n thus denoted by y n instead of the usual yn 5 1 1 truncated simplicial objects we start the outer induction with n 0 our 1 truncated diagram in ho e then consists of a pair of parallel arrows so we have only the stage k 0 in the inner induction this means choosing representatives for each of the two face maps d 0 d 1 y 1 y 0 making this reedy fibrant means changing the combined map d 0 d 1 y 1 y 0 d 0 y 0 d 1 into a fibration i e factoring this as y 1 y 1 y 0 y 0 and replacing y 1 by y 1 5 2 2 truncated simplicial objects for n 1 x is 2 and y 1 j 1 0 e is the reedy fibrant diagram just constructed to define y 20 j 2 0 e at stage k 0 in the inner induction pick representatives for each of the full length composites in this case the three maps y 2 y 0 denoted by d 0 d 1 d 0 d 2 and d 1 d 2 in canonical form this means m 2 0 is the product of three copies of y 0 indexed by didj 0 i j 2 and our choice of representatives yields a single map m 20 into the product at stage k 1 we must first choose representatives for the components of 21 y 2 1 that is for the maps d 0 d 1 and d 2 y 2 y 1 which are all the maps 2 1 in j the generalized diagonal map 21 of 2 4 takes y 0 didj i j to the product y 0 didj y 0 dj 1 di in accordance with the simplicial identities note that the target of 21 is 0 j 2 y 1 dj 26 d blanc m w johnson and j m turner thus we have a pair of maps into a pullback diagram 5 3 y 2 m 20 21 y 2 1 d 0 d 1 d 2 m 21 m 21 y j 2 y 1 dj m 20 i j 2 y 0 didj j 2 i 1 y 0 didj where the outer diagram commutes up to homotopy for any choice of representatives for d 0 d 1 and d 2 the dotted map exists by lemma a 5 after possibly altering the dashed map within its homotopy class yielding a full 2 truncated simplicial object which rectifies y 21 by lemma 2 7 changing m 2 1 into a fibration provides us with a reedy fibrant replacement y 2 j 2 e 5 4 3 truncated simplicial objects at stage n 2 with x 3 for the first time we are in the situation of 3 16 somewhat simplified by the fact that we have a single object n in each grading n of j in particular we will have no separated operations yet in the inner induction for k 0 we choose representatives for each full length map in y 32 to obtain y 3 0 the full length composites are the four maps didjd with 0 i j 3 so m 30 is a product of four copies of y 0 indexed by these maps and the generalized diagonal of 2 4 takes each copy of y 0 didjd to the product y 0 didjd y 0 dj 1 did y 0 d 2 didj we make an initial choice to be modified below of 21 y 2 1 i e of each composite djd 3 1 for 0 j 3 within its homotopy class again this yields a pair of maps into a pullback diagram 5 5 y 3 m 30 2 1 y 2 1 m 31 m 31 y j k 3 y 1 djd m 30 i j k 3 y 0 didjd 31 j 3 i 1 y 0 didjd where the right vertical is a product of fibrations y 1 m 10 i 1 y 0 di by reedy fibrancy of y 2 since y 32 is homotopy commutative by lemma a 5 we obtain a dotted map m 3 1 after altering the dashed map that is our choice for each djd within its homotopy class by lemma 2 7 this yields y 31 still representing y 3 2 a constructive approach to higher homotopy operations 27 it is at stage k 2 in the inner induction that we first encounter a possible obstruction we must now choose representatives for d 3 2 0 3 in the homotopy class given by y 32 as in 2 9 we know that the target of the forgetful map from m 31 is the product of the lower left and upper right corners of 5 5 thus 32 is a product of two maps the first taking each factor y 1 djd 0 j 3 diagonally to a product y 1 djd y 1 d 1 dj and the second taking y 0 didjd 0 i j 3 diagonally to the product y 0 didjd y 0 did 1 dj y 0 dj 1 d 1 di as in 3 16 we now factor as a trivial cofibration to f 1 followed by a fibration and pull back the product of the forgetful maps 32 m 2 1 j 2 y 1 dj i j 2 y 0 didj as in 5 3 indexed by the first face maps d 3 2 0 3 along to obtain a potential mapping diagram as in 3 15 y 3 1 32 y 3 2 d 0 d 1 d 2 d 3 p p p 2 3 2 y 3 1 p 32 y p 1 f 3 y r 2 3 y 2 ms k 1 q 31 y f 2 y q s 3 m 2 1 j 3 y 1 djd i j 3 y 0 didjd f 1 3 j 2 y 1 djd i j 2 y 0 didjd note that as in 3 16 we may choose f 1 to be a product of free path spaces so we can think of as a choice of homotopies between the various decompositions in y 2 of maps 3 0 in as the right vertical rectangular pullback has horizontal fibrations we can apply lemma a 5 and the fact that the original outermost diagram commutes up to homo topy because y 32 is homotopy commutative to deduce that there is a map in the correct homotopy class yielding as indicated the question is whether 1 by corollary a 10 our secondary operation consists precisely of those satisfying thus the question is answered in the affirmative precisely when our secondary operation y 32 vanishes in that case by lemma a 5 applied to the upper left square with a fibration we can find satisfying 1 so inducing the dotted 2 by the pullback property we then alter the map labeled d 0 d 1 d 2 d 3 within its homotopy class 28 d blanc m w johnson and j m turner by instead using r 2 which will make the entire diagram now commute since msk 1 r 2 s s 1 and q q 1 3 2 thus we obtain a full 3 truncated simplicial object y 3 if we wish to proceed further we take a reedy fibrant replacement if y 32 does not vanish then there is no way to extend this y 2 to a full 3 truncated object 5 6 remark as with any obstruction theory when y 32 does not vanish we need to backtrack and see if we can get our obstruction to vanish by modifying previous choices we observe that in special cases given a truncated simplicial object there is a formal procedure for adding degeneracies to obtain a full similarly truncated simplicial object see e g b 1 6 6 pointed higher operations most familiar examples of higher homotopy operations are pointed so we now describe the modifications needed in our general setup when the indexing category j as well as the model category e are pointed see 2 b this will also cover hybrid cases where certain composites in the diagram are required to be zero in e rather than just null homotopic 6 1 lemma if e is a pointed model category y j ho e a pointed diagram and x obj j with x 0 then a any choice of a representative y x 0 g of y g for every g j x 0 yields a lifting of y j x 0 to y x 0 j x 0 e b any pointed reedy fibrant y 1 j x 1 e as in 3 1 ii has a pointwise extension to a functor y x 1 j x 1 e which lifts y x 1 proof for a note that if g j y g must be the zero map but otherwise any choice of lifting will do since j x 0 has no non trivial compositions for b follow the proof of lemma 3 3 with j replacing j using reduced matching spaces and definition 2 21 for the fibrancy we also have the following version of lemma 3 9 6 2 lemma assuming 2 k n x any pointed functor y jn e with a pointed extension to j xk 1 induces a pullback grid with natural dashed maps 6 3 y x k 1 k 1 k 1 p mx k 1 n x k 1 y qk 1 q x k 1 y j x s s k m s k 1 j x s forget m x k 1 forget j x t t k y t j x s s k j s v v k y v a constructive approach to higher homotopy operations 29 we then deduce the following analogue of proposition 3 11 with a similar proof 6 4 proposition assuming 2 k n x any pointed functor yk j x k e as in 3 1 induces maps into a pullback grid 6 5 y x mx k 1 x k y x k k 1 k 1 mx k k m x k y p x k y pk 1 rk j x s s k y s ms k 1 n x k 1 y qk 1 q x k 1 y j x s s k m s k 1 forget m x k 1 forget j x t t k y t j x s s k j s v v k y v again the dashed map only makes the outermost diagram commute up to homotopy furthermore the dotted map mxk exists after altering x k y x k within its homotopy class if and only if there is a dotted map k such that pk 1 k k 1 and rk k x k y x k with this at hand we may modify definition 3 16 as follows to obtain a sequence of obstructions to extending pointed diagrams 6 6 total pointed higher homotopy operations assume given pointed functors y xk j x k ho e y x k 1 j x k 1 e and a pointed reedy fibrant yk j x k e as in 3 1 ii this means each m s k 1 y s m s k 1 is a fibration factor x k see lemma 2 18 as a weak equivalence followed by a fibration and pull back the right column of 6 5 along to obtain the following pullback 30 d blanc m w johnson and j m turner grid 6 7 y x k 1 x k y x k p p k x k y x k 1 p x k y pk 1 f 3 y r k j x s s k y s q x k 1 y f 2 y q s j x s s k m s k 1 j x t t k y t f 1 j x s s k j s v v k y v as in 3 16 lemma a 5 allows us to modify so as to obtain a map y x f 3 into the pullback 6 8 definition we define the total pointed higher homotopy operation for x to be the set y xk 1 of homotopy classes of maps y x f 2 with q xk with q where is defined to be the composite y x x k j x t t k yk t f 1 we say y xk 1 vanishes at y x f 2 as above if is homotopic to the composite y x k 1 q x k 1 f 2 and that y xk 1 vanishes if it vanishes at some value 6 9 remark in many cases of interest we will have q x k 1 in which case the pointed operation y xk 1 vanishes at precisely when as one might expect so the subset vanishes precisely when it contains the zero class we have chosen our definitions so as to have the following analogue of proposition 3 18 6 10 proposition assume given pointed functors y xk j x k ho e y x k 1 j xk 1 e and a pointed reedy fibrant yk j x k e as in 3 1 ii for x n k 2 then there exists a further pointed extension to y xk j x k e if and only if the total higher homotopy operation y xk 1 vanishes proof once again the definition of y xk 1 together with corollary a 10 implies that each value is homotopic to for some with r k x k and q x k thus the obstruction vanishes at if and only if there exists such a with k 1 precisely as in the proof of proposition 3 18 the upper a constructive approach to higher homotopy operations 31 left pullback square in 6 7 then produces the lift into p k x or equivalently a map y x m k x yielding the required pointed extension by lemma 2 17 if y xk 1 does not vanish then there is no choice of for which such a lift exists and so there is no pointed extension compatible with the given choices 6 11 remark given pointed functors y xk j x k ho e y x k 1 j x k 1 e and a pointed reedy fibrant yk j x k e as in 3 1 ii for x n k 2 we may define separated pointed higher homotopy operations y xk 1 j 1 for x as in definition 4 8 using a refinement of 6 7 constructed mutatis mutandis with products over j x s replaced everywhere by products over j x s separation lemma 4 2 is stated in sufficient generality to apply here too with remark 4 5 modified accordingly yielding the following variant of theorem 4 24 6 12 theorem assume given pointed functors y xk j x k ho e y x k 1 j x k 1 e and a pointed reedy fibrant yk j x k e as in 3 1 ii for x n k 2 then the total pointed higher homotopy operation separates into a sequence of k 1 pointed operations and the following are equivalent 1 a further extension to y xk j x k e exists 2 the total pointed operation y xk 1 vanishes 3 the associated sequence y xk 1 j 1 1 j k of separated pointed higher homotopy operations of 4 8 vanish so in particular each in turn is defined 7 long toda brackets and massey products we are finally in a position to apply our general theory to the two most famil iar examples of higher order operations long toda brackets and higher massey products since both are cases of the pointed higher operations fully described in sections 3 4 and 6 we thought it would be easier for the reader to consider two specific examples in detail briefly indicating what needs to be done for the higher version 7 a right justified toda brackets since the ordinary toda bracket of length 3 was treated in section 1 we start with the next case the toda bracket of length 4 the first example of a long toda bracket in the sense of wa thus if e is a pointed model category assume given a diagram y j ho e of the form 7 1 y 4 k y 3 h y 2 g y 1 f y 0 with each adjacent composite null homotopic that is a chain complex of length 4 in ho e as in example 2 13 compare 1 2 without loss of generality we can assume all objects involved are both cofibrant and fibrant applying the double induction procedure of 3 1 we see that we must deal with chain complexes of length n 4 as follows a when n 0 we have no inner induction and making the result reedy fibrant consists of factoring the representative to produce a fibration f y 1 y 0 in the specified class f 32 d blanc m w johnson and j m turner b when n 1 note that j x t is empty if x t 1 for this pointed indexing category so as a consequence m x k if x k 1 thus m 2 0 so m 2 1 is simply the fiber of f since f g by lemma a 5 we can choose a representative g for g which factors as a fibration y 2 m 2 1 fib f followed by the inclusion fib f y 1 c when n 2 again m 3 0 m 3 1 while the case k 2 is just that of our length 3 toda bracket f g h in this case the indexing set for products in the right column of 6 7 is the singleton j 3 2 while the forgetful map in the bottom row of 6 5 is the identity of the zero object with the zero map factoring as a trivial cofibration followed by a fibration as in the bottom row of 6 7 and pulling back the right column yields the diagram 7 2 y 3 h p p 3 2 y f 3 y y 2 g f 2 y m 2 1 forget f 1 y 1 f y 0 thus f 1 is a model for the reduced path space on y 1 with the path fibration however since f was chosen above to be a fibration the composite f 1 y 0 is a fibration too with f 1 contractible so we see that f 2 being the pullback of the dotted rectangle is a model for the loop space y 0 which we denote by y 0 similarly m 2 1 is a model for fib f our total secondary pointed homotopy operation y 31 cf 6 8 is thus a set of maps y 3 y 0 and it vanishes when this set contains the zero map cf remark 6 9 this is our usual toda bracket f g h described in the language of section 6 d in order for our four fold toda bracket f g h k denoted by y 42 above to be defined y 31 must vanish this allows us to choose a pointed extension y 3 j 3 e of y 2 which realizes y j 3 the fact that the diagram y 3 has realized y through filtration degree 3 means that each of the maps g and h factors through the fiber of the previous one as in the following solid a constructive approach to higher homotopy operations 33 commutative diagram 7 3 y 4 k 1 k fib h 1 y 3 h 1 h fib g 1 y 2 g 1 g fib f g 2 y 1 f y 0 making y 3 pointed reedy fibrant 2 21 just means ensuring that the maps h 1 and g 1 are fibrations e at stage n 3 in the outer induction we attempt to find the dotted lift k 1 in 7 3 after having chosen a suitable representative h for the given homotopy class h which is possible by the vanishing of the previous obstruction again we have m 4 0 m 4 1 and m 4 2 q 4 2 n 4 2 so the only interesting case is k 3 in the inner induction the separation grid of lemma 4 2 then takes the form 7 4 y 4 k 1 p k p 4 3 y f 2 4 4 3 y f 1 4 4 3 y y 3 h 1 h f 2 3 4 3 y f 1 3 4 3 y m 3 2 f 2 2 4 3 f 1 2 4 3 y f 1 3 3 2 f 1 2 3 2 y f 1 1 3 2 f 1 1 4 3 y 2 g 1 g 55 m 2 1 g 2 y 1 f y 0 where we have extended the pullback grid downwards and to the right to show how it was constructed from the previous case diagram 7 2 using lemma 4 17 we have also indicated how representatives of the maps of 7 3 fit in as in step c above we can identify f 1 2 3 2 as a model for y 0 and m 2 1 as a model for fib f similarly f 1 2 4 3 is a model for y 1 using the vertical fibrations in the rectangle with diagonal corners f 1 2 4 3 and y 1 34 d blanc m w johnson and j m turner likewise f 1 3 4 3 a model for m 2 1 using horizontal fibrations in the larger square beneath it and f 2 3 4 3 is a model for 2 y 0 now using the rectangle with diagonal corners f 2 3 4 3 and f 1 2 3 2 along with the previous identification of the latter similarly m 3 2 is a model for fib g 1 of 7 3 while p 4 3 is fib h 1 which is also the homotopy fiber see 7 11 below for the full identification therefore the final obstruction to having a dotted lift k 1 in 7 3 or 7 4 is the composite k h 1 note that there are no factors of type g k i j as in 4 18 here since we can always choose the zero map as our factorization of the zero map between zero objects 7 5 remark our total pointed tertiary homotopy operation y 42 is a set of homo topy classes y 4 m 2 1 however using lemma 4 2 we can replace it by two separated higher homotopy operations for 4 in the sense of 4 8 1 the second order operation y 42 2 y 4 y 1 2 if y 42 2 vanishes the third order operation y 42 3 y 4 2 y 0 is defined and serves as the final obstruction to lifting y by definition this is our four fold toda bracket f g h k 7 6 lemma given a pointed reedy fibrant diagram y 3 realizing 7 1 through filtration 3 the associated second order separated higher homotopy operation y 42 2 is our usual toda bracket g h k proof note that f 1 3 3 2 is a model for the homotopy fiber of g y 2 y 1 which is not itself a fibration thus the rectangle with corners f 1 3 3 2 and y 1 in 7 4 is a homotopy invariant version of the rectangle with corners f 2 and y 0 in 7 2 used to define our toda bracket in step c above this time applied to the left 3 maps in 7 1 the map corresponding to in 7 2 the value of the toda bracket is the map y 4 f 1 2 4 3 obtained by composing with the vertical maps f 1 4 4 3 f 1 2 4 3 which is indeed the definition of the value of y 4 2 2 associated to our choices see definition 4 8 7 7 aside note that if the dotted forgetful map m 2 1 y 1 in 7 4 were a fibra tion the horizontal dotted map above it would be a fibration too so right properness would imply that the vertical map m 3 2 f 1 3 3 2 would be a weak equivalence 7 8 length n toda brackets the general procedure described in section 6 tells us what needs to be done for toda diagrams chain complexes y in ho e 7 9 y n fn y n 1 fn 1 y 3 f 3 y 2 f 2 y 1 f 1 y 0 of arbitrary length n we sketch the main features of the general construction already discernible in the case n 4 described above in the double induction of 3 1 we can concentrate on the last stage assuming the vanishing of shorter brackets on the right which guarantees the existence of a a constructive approach to higher homotopy operations 35 solid diagram 7 10 y n gn fn fib gn 1 y g 2 n y n 1 gn 1 fib gn 2 y y 3 g 3 f 3 fib g 2 y g 23 y 2 g 2 f 2 fib f 1 y g 22 y 1 f 1 y 0 analogous to 7 3 our length n toda bracket f 1 f 2 fn 1 fn will be the final obstruction to finding the dotted map gn in 7 10 perhaps after altering fn within its homotopy class the existence of the fibrations gk for 2 k n and the fact that f 1 is a fibration mean that we have a lifting yn 1 jn 1 e of y jn 1 which we have made pointed reedy fibrant the underlining in the notation represents our intention to leave that portion fixed the construction of the separation grid for yn 1 4 23 greatly simplifies in this case as we see in comparing 7 2 to 7 4 at each step one writes the previous separation grid vertically instead of horizontally on the right after changing the previously chosen gn 1 into a fibration thus altering y n 1 up to homotopy we then factor the zero map and pull back the leftmost existing column to form a new column to its left factoring the zero map from q x k 1 to the second place from the bottom in this new column and again pulling back we note that the intermediate object produced by this factorization is a reduced path object so by induction the entry immediately above it is a loop object being the pullback over a fibration with upper right and lower left corners contractible one because it is the reduced path object and the other by induction moreover the number of loops increases as we move up and to the left see lemma 8 3 repeat this step until the new column involves just two maps so the second object from the bottom is at the same height as the product of the objects m s k 1 on the right the pullback in the upper left corner is now the actual fiber of gn 1 to 36 d blanc m w johnson and j m turner illustrate we reproduce diagram 7 4 with the pieces identified up to homotopy 7 11 y 4 k 1 p k fib h 1 y f 2 4 4 3 y f 1 4 4 3 y y 3 h 1 h 2 y 0 y fib f y fib g 1 p y 1 y 1 y fib g y 0 py 1 py 2 y 2 g 1 g 55 fib f g 2 y 1 note that while not all the pullbacks in the grid can be easily identified the targets of the separated operations boxed are iterated loop spaces on the original objects of 7 9 as one would expect for long toda brackets this last obstruction consisting of a subset of the homotopy classes of maps into the top left iterated loop space then represents our length n toda bracket f 1 f 2 fn 1 fn with the lower separated higher homotopy operations corresponding to the vanishing of the lower obstructions necessary in order to define it together with those already assumed to vanish in order to build the current commuting diagram 7 b massey products as a hybrid case the classical massey product cf ms is defined for three cohomology classes of the same space x h x r for some ring r equipped with null homotopies f 0 and g 0 for the two products like a toda bracket the massey product serves as the obstruction to simultaneously making both products strictly zero see bbg 4 this situation may be described by the pointed indexing category j 7 12 g zz rr f uu zz b c oo d zztt tt tt tt tt t e tt a here the dashed maps are in j and the others are in j the inner diamond com mutes with the solid composite and the outer diamond commutes with the dashed composite a constructive approach to higher homotopy operations 37 the corresponding pointed diagram y j ho t has products of eilenberg mac lane spaces ki k r i in all but the top slot 7 13 y g yys s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s kr ks kt tt 1 xxrr rr rr rr rr rr rr r 2 ks t p kr ks t 2 oo kr s kt xxrr rr rr rr rr rr rr 1 kr s qq kr s t where the central diamond represents associativity of the cup product maps 1 and 2 are the two projections and we have omitted the zero map from top to bottom that appears in 7 12 in the interest of clarity choose a strictly associative model of the eilenberg mac lane spectrum in ques tion cf ro with strictly pointed multiplication so in particular at each level kr is a simplicial or topological abelian group we can then make all of 7 13 be low y g involving only the cup product maps strictly commutative our massey product will be the total pointed higher homotopy operation y g 1 for n k 2 from 2 16 we see that if we let k kr ks t kr s kt then m f 1 is the pullback of the two multiplication maps kr ks t kr s t kr s kt with a natural inclusion forgetful map i 1 m f 1 k the pullback grid of 6 7 then takes the form 7 14 p g 2 y pk 1 f 3 y r k kr ks kt q g 1 y f 2 y q s m f 1 2 i 1 3 i 1 i 1 i 1 k pkr s pks t k pkr s t kr s ks t k kr s t thus a point in f 2 is given by u v x u v z w pkr s pks t m f 1 pkr s t with u u v v and w xu vz we thus have a natural map f 2 kr s t kr s t sending u v x u v z w to xu w v z w postcomposition with the difference map d kr s t kr s t kr s t yields xu v z now y g maps into the top right corner of 7 14 by a lift of and thereby on to m f 1 and into the bottom middle term by f g l with l some nullhomotopy of together these two maps induce the map y g f 2 of 6 8 38 d blanc m w johnson and j m turner postcomposing with d gives the usual massey product y g kr s t h r s t 1 y g r the two factors of merely give the usual indeterminacy for the massey product as we can see by choosing l f or l g 7 15 remark an alternative definition of the usual higher massey products more in line with that given for the toda bracket appears in bbg 4 1 8 fully reduced diagrams ultimately we would like to develop an algebra of higher order operations along the lines of toda s original juggling lemmas see t 2 1 as a first step in this direction we consider a special type of pointed diagram which most closely resembles the long toda diagram of 7 9 the most useful property of the separated higher operations associated to toda diagrams is that we can often identify their targets f j j 1 x k as loop spaces as we saw in 7 11 it turns out the property of the pointed indexing category j needed for this to happen is the following 8 1 definition a pointed indexing category j as in 2 12 is called fully reduced if any morphism decreasing degree by at least 2 lies in j 8 2 remark if j is fully reduced for x k 1 we have j x t t k y t and so m x k 1 cf 2 16 as well we deduce that n x k 1 q x k 1 too cf 6 3 since both are fibers of a product of monomorphisms by lemma 6 2 under mild assumptions on e furthermore the map forget of 2 16 factors through j s t t s 1 y t so no factors of type g k 1 j x k cf 4 20 are needed when constructing the separation grid 4 18 this also implies that f j j x k is contractible for j k which is the key ingredient for identifying the targets of the separated operations as loop spaces our key decomposition result is the following 8 3 lemma if j is a fully reduced pointed indexing category and n k j 2 we have f j 1 j x k fk j fk fk j fk x v j 1 y v in 4 18 where each fi is a non identity map in j with target of degree i proof we prove this by induction on k for fixed n and x as in lemma 4 17 in each case we combine two pullbacks over fibrations one of which has fiber identified at an earlier stage with two corners contractible the upper left corner source is then homotopy equivalent to the loop space on the lower right corner see step e of 7 a a constructive approach to higher homotopy operations 39 for 2 j k we use the basic pullback rectangle 8 4 f 1 3 s 2 y j s u u 1 y u f 1 2 s 2 y j s u u 1 m u 0 f 1 1 s 2 j s u u 1 j u v v 0 y v to construct the pullback rectangle 8 5 f 1 2 x 3 y j x s s 3 f 1 3 s 2 y j x s s 3 f 1 1 s 2 f 1 1 x 3 j x s s 3 y u j x s s 3 j s u u 1 j u v v 0 y v where the vertical maps are fibrations and both j x s s 3 f 1 1 s 2 and f 1 1 x 3 contractible as in remark 8 2 for 2 j k we similarly use the pullback rectangle 8 6 f j 1 j x k y j x s s k f j 1 k s k 1 y j x s s k f j 1 j 1 s k 1 f j 1 j 1 x k j x s s k f j 2 k s k 1 j x s s k f j 2 j 1 s k 1 in which the vertical maps are fibrations together with the fact that f j 1 j 1 x k and each f j 1 j 1 s k 1 are contractible to prove the claim by induction on j since loops commute with products 40 d blanc m w johnson and j m turner for 2 j k recall that when s 2 the first non trivial case with k 1 1 involves the first pullback diagram 8 7 m s 1 y forget j s u u 1 y u j s u u 1 j u v v 0 y v for 2 j k we have the second pullback diagram 8 8 m s k 1 y p s k 1 y f k 2 k s k 1 n s k 1 q s k 1 f k 2 k 1 s k 1 and combining products of either type into 8 9 f k 1 k x k y j x s s k m s k 1 y f k 1 k 1 x k j x s s k f k 2 k s k 1 j x s s k f k 2 k 1 s k 1 yields a pullback with horizontal fibrations and with f k 1 k 1 x k and of course contractible so the result with 2 j k also follows by induction with these conventions each factor in the product y x j 1 y v is a j ary toda bracket by construction and vanishing of the product is equivalent to vanishing of each factor 8 10 theorem in the fully reduced case all higher operations decompose into a sequence of toda brackets of order no greater than the degree of the first target object in the string appendix a background material we collect here a number of basic facts about model categories needed in this paper and one non standard lemma included for ease of reference elsewhere we refer the reader to hir 7 1 7 3 for the basics on model categories and homotopy assumed for this appendix a 1 notation given two maps f g x y we write f r g if the maps are right homotopic and f l g if the maps are left homotopic a constructive approach to higher homotopy operations 41 a 2 lemma homotopy lifting property suppose we have the solid diagram with q a fibration and t cofibrant a 3 t f y q z then there is a homotopy l q f if and only if there is a map f t y with a homotopy f l f such that q f dually if z is fibrant and f is a cofibration then there is a homotopy r q f precisely when there is a map q y z with a homotopy q r q such that q f proof assume q is a fibration let t t i 1 i 2 cyl t p t be a factorization of the fold map t t 1 t 1 t t such that i 1 i 2 is a cofibration and p is a weak equivalence cofibrancy of t implies i 1 t cyl t is an acyclic cofibration by hir 7 3 7 given a homotopy h cyl t z with h i 1 q f and h i 2 we may use the left lifting property in a 4 t i 1 f y q cyl t h h z to factor h as q h and set f h i 2 if f is instead a cofibration use the dual argument a 5 lemma homotopy pullback property suppose we have the following solid diagram where the square is a pullback t is cofibrant and the two vertical maps are fibrations a 6 t g p f w y r j y q x i z then there is a dotted map f t y with a homotopy q f l ip precisely when there is a dotted map g t w with a homotopy j g l f and r g p proof suppose there is a homotopy q f l i p since t is cofibrant and q is a fibration the homotopy lifting property with i p produces f t y homotopic to f such that q f i p since the square is a pullback there is a map g t w such that j g f and r g p since f l f we conclude that f l j g a 7 corollary if x is cofibrant k x y is any pointed map and h y z is a pointed fibration then the composite h k x z is null homotopic if and 42 d blanc m w johnson and j m turner only if there exists some k x y left homotopic to k which factors through fib h a 8 lemma homotopy ladder property suppose we are given the following di agram in which both squares are strict pullbacks t is cofibrant the indicated hori zontal maps are fibrations and the outer diagram commutes up to homotopy a 9 t u y r v t w y p q x s y u z consider the following three statements 1 there is a map t u such that r and there are left homotopies l and l q 2 l q and there is a map t w homotopic to such that p t 3 there is a map t w homotopic to such that is homotopic to q and u s t then 1 2 3 furthermore if s is a monomorphism then 1 2 and 3 are all equivalent proof 1 2 since l it follows that l q l q since p l p t applying the homotopy lifting property with q p and f to t there exists l with p t 2 1 let l with p t and let q then u u q s p s t since the outside rectangle is a pullback there exists t u such that and r thus l also l q l q 2 3 given l such that p t set q then l q l q also from the squares commuting u u q s p s t finally we assume that s x z is a monomorphism we show that 3 2 from the squares commuting we have s t u u q s p thus t p because s is a monomorphism and l q as above a 10 corollary in a 9 assume again that the squares are pullbacks t is cofi brant and the horizontal maps are fibrations assume further that u l s t then we have the following 1 there exists a map t u such that r and l q 2 there exists a map t w such that l q and p t moreover if s is additionally a monomorphism then there is a homotopy l a constructive approach to higher homotopy operations 43 proof for 1 since u l s t by the homotopy pullback property there is a map t u homotopic to such that u s t since the outer rectangle is a pullback there is a map t u such that q and r thus l q for 2 we have u l s t again by the homotopy pullback property there is a map l such that u s t so since the bottom square is a pullback there is a map t w with t p and q and so l q finally u u q s p s t so if s is a monomorphism we may conclude from lemma a 8 that l we have the duals of lemma a 5 corollary a 7 lemma a 8 and corollary a 10 a 11 lemma suppose the following square is a pushout v is fibrant and the two horizontal maps are cofibrations a 12 w p i y f x j p z g v then there is a dotted map f y v with a homotopy p r f i precisely when there is a dotted map g z v with a homotopy g r f and g j p a 13 corollary if k x y is a pointed cofibration and h y z is any pointed map with z fibrant the composite h k x z is null homotopic if and only if there exists a map h y z right homotopic to h which factors through cof k a 14 lemma suppose we are given the following diagram in which both squares are strict pushouts t is fibrant the indicated horizontal maps are cofibrations and the outer diagram commutes up to homotopy a 15 u p r v t w p p q x s y u z t consider the following three statements 1 there exists a map z t such that u and there are right homotopies r s and r s t 2 r t and there is a map x t homotopic to such that p q 3 there is a map x t homotopic to such that is homotopic to t and r q 44 d blanc m w johnson and j m turner then 1 2 3 furthermore if is an epimorphism then 1 2 and 3 are all equivalent a 16 corollary in a 15 assume again that the squares are pushouts t is fibrant and the horizontal maps are cofibrations assume further that r r q then we have the following 1 there exists a map z t such that u and r q s t 2 there exists a map x t such that r t and p q moreover if is additionally an epimorphism then there is a homotopy r s we define the reduced path object pw associated to a pointed object w by the pullback a 17 pw y pw j path w p 1 p 2 w 1 w 0 w w a 18 lemma if w is fibrant then pw is weakly contractible furthermore if f x w is pointed then f is right null homotopic precisely when f factors as x pw pw w proof first the diagram a 17 can be expanded to the pullback a 19 pw y j path w pr 2 p 1 p 2 w since w is fibrant the right hand vertical map is a trivial fibration by hir 7 3 7 hence the left hand vertical map is a trivial fibration by hir 7 2 12 thus pw is weakly contractible if f x w is null homotopic there is a map h x path w with p 1 h f and p 2 h 0 from the first factorization and the pullback property of a 17 there is a map x pw such that f pw we similarly define the reduced cone cx on a pointed object x by the pushout a 20 x x p i 1 i 2 1 x 0 x ix cyl x cx a 21 lemma if x is cofibrant then cx is weakly contractible furthermore if f x w is a pointed map then f is left null homotopic precisely when f factors as x ix cx w a 22 lemma let x be cofibrant and both z andw fibrant if the composite g h k is right null homotopic then the shorter composite h k is also right null homotopic if and only if there is a null homotopy of g h k such that the solid commutative a constructive approach to higher homotopy operations 45 diagram a 23 x k y h pfg pfg fg y j i z g pw pw w extends to the full diagram above with a null homotopy for h k and fg the pullback of g along pw proof suppose the composite g h k is null homotopic then lemma a 18 gives a factorization g h k pw in a 23 since pw is a fibration so is i if h k is also null homotopic then this composite factors as h k pz for some x pz now factor as x v q pz with a cofibration and q a trivial fibration since x is cofibrant and pz is weakly contractible by lemma a 18 v is a trivial cofibration therefore pz q lifts to a map v pfg with i pfg pz q setting makes the whole diagram commute the dual version is a 24 lemma let y be fibrant and both z and w cofibrant suppose the composite k h g is known to be left null homotopic then the shorter composite k h is also left null homotopic if and only if for some null homotopy of k h g the solid commutative diagram a 25 w p iw g cw z h mg cmg x k y extends to the full diagram above with giving a null homotopy for k h and mg the pushout of g along iw appendix b indeterminacy for most higher homotopy operations one cannot expect a closed formula for the indeterminacy of operations of the type provided by t 2 lemma 1 1 for the classical secondary toda bracket this is because tertiary and higher operations depend on choices made for the vanishing of the lower order operations and the amount of choice remaining might vary for different sets of earlier choices however if we take these earlier choices as given within the inductive framework described here the only remaining source of indeterminacy is in the choice of the specific map which makes the outer diagram in a 9 commute on the nose and how that choice affects the resulting lift note that the homotopy class is then fixed as is the actual map u s t t z to help keep track of all this in this appendix will denote our initial choice of the map with the 46 d blanc m w johnson and j m turner induced lift while will denote some other choice with induced lift we now investigate how changing to changes to as maps t w given a choice of such that u u corresponds uniquely to a map into the pullback b 1 t y u y u y u y u z while a choice of such a map equipped with a right homotopy h r corresponds to a map into the pullback b 2 t h p y u y u path y 1 u m y 1 u y z where y iy path y m y y is a path factorization as in a 17 in fact taking a further pullback b 3 w p u y p y u u w q y we find that the image of the left vertical map p is essentially the indeterminacy see corollary b 10 below note that there is a canonical choice of induced map t y u in b 1 corresponding to and a similar canonical choice of induced map t y u in b 2 corresponding to the canonical self homotopy h of namely the composite t y iy path y which will be used below given a map u y z consider the following pullback grid b 4 y u y u u path y m y u y u y y y 1 u pr 2 y u y 1 u y z pr 2 z b 5 notation assume given four maps u y z t y v b y and a y a the pointed set t y u u based at itself will be denoted by varu a constructive approach to higher homotopy operations 47 b the pointed set h t path y h r u u of right homotopies based at h will be denoted by varu c the set a b v of lifts of with respect to v will be denoted by liftv in accordance with remark 3 2 we can disregard the distinction between the left homotopies appearing in the first half of appendix a and the right homotopies we have here b 6 remark from the pullback properties of the constructions above we see that there are natural bijections of pointed sets varu liftu and varu liftu where liftu is based at and liftu is based at we then have b 7 lemma given q t y with p t there is a natural bijection of sets varu liftp where p p p proof we may expand b 4 into b 8 w p u zz p p p rel yyss ss ss ss ss s y u u path y w p q zz p p y w 1 q yyrr rr rr rr rr r 1 p pr 2 w q p y u u u 22 y y 1 u pr 2 y u w q yyss ss ss ss ss s q p y x 1 sxxqq qq qq qq qq pr 2 x s y 1 u y z pr 2 z since the rightmost face is a pullback by assumption as are both the front and left long rectangular vertical faces by construction the lower leftmost face and hence the upper leftmost face are pullbacks too we define p rel by making the upper rightmost face a pullback so that the back upper vertical face is too we think of t y as mapping to the front lower left y and t w to the back lower left w with t y mapping to the front right y and t w to the back right w since u u the lower pullback rectangle in b 4 implies that induce a map f t y u and thus f t w p since also u s p s t and a right homotopy h r is a map h t path y which together with t y w induces h t p rel together with f these induce a lift of along p conversely any lift t w p u of along p yields h and thus h by projecting along the structure maps of the top pullback square b 9 remark when y we have path y y y so y u y u z and w p u w z in this case a map t w p u thus corresponds up to 48 d blanc m w johnson and j m turner homotopy to a choice of map together with a homotopy class in t z adjoint to the indeterminacy construction of sp 1 1 note that each of the vertical faces in b 8 is a pullback over a fibration so they are homotopy meaningful the indeterminacy of our operations is then described by the following b 10 corollary given q t y also satisfying p t in a 9 the indeterminacy in our operation produced by varying lies in the image of p t w p u t w where p p p in fact we can restrict to the fiber of p over the subset consisting of those homotopy classes containing an element of liftp proof in b 8 each choice of a lifting of has the form p p for some t w p u thus p as required by restricting to those with p p we can apply lemma a 2 to produce a different representative with p
