functors associates a tower of polynomial approximations the taylor tower to a functor of topo logical spaces over a fixed space we define a new tower the varying center tower for functors of categories with a fixed initial object such as algebras under a fixed ring spectrum we construct this new tower using elements of the taylor tower constructions of bauer johnson and mccarthy for functors of simplicial model categories and show how the varying center tower differs from taylor towers in terms of the properties of its individual terms and convergence behavior we prove that there is a combinatorial model for the varying center tower given as a pro equivalence between the varying center tower and towers of cosimplicial objects this generalizes eldred s cosimplicial models for finite stages of taylor towers as an application we present models for the de rham complex of rational commutative ring spectra due to rezk on the one hand and goodwillie and waldhausen on the other and use our result to conclude that these two models will be equivalent when extended to e ring spectra 1 introduction this paper arose from a desire to understand the connection between two seemingly disparate ideas for defining the quillen derived de rham cohomol ogy for rational commutative algebras and their extensions to ring spectra the first suggested by friedhelm waldhausen and tom goodwillie uses goodwillie s calculus of homotopy functors a theory that has played a sig nificant role in understanding connections between k theory hochschild ho mology and related constructions the second is a combinatorial approach explored by charles rezk for a homotopy functor of spaces or spectra that is a functor that pre serves weak equivalences goodwillie constructed a tower of functors and natural transformations that can be viewed as playing the role of a taylor series for the functor 11 this construction has been extended to more gen eral contexts such as simplicial or topological model categories in 19 and 1 in this paper we work primarily with the discrete calculus a variant of goodwillie calculus developed in 1 the discrete calculus associates to a functor f c s and morphism f a b in c a sequence of functors 1 http arxiv org abs 1506 02112 v 2 2 k bauer r eldred b johnson and r mccarthy f nf cf s and natural transformations 1 f f n 1 f n f n 1 f n 1 f q f n 1 f nf q f n f n 1 f f 1 f f 0 f where c is a simplicial model category the category cf is the category of factorizations of f a b in c and s is a suitable model category of spectra such as that of 8 or 16 the nth term in this tower can be thought of as a degree n approximation to f where being degree n means that the functor takes certain types of n 1 cubical homotopy pushout diagrams to homotopy pullback diagrams goodwillie s original formulation of polynomial degree n functors used a stronger notion of degree n if f is nice in the sense of definition 4 5 the discrete tower converges to f that is f is weakly equivalent to the homotopy inverse limit f f of the tower to explain how we see the de rham complex in terms of taylor towers we first look at an analogous situation for the taylor series of a function consider a function f r r and a real number b we can construct the nth taylor polynomial for f about b 2 t bnf x n k 0 f n b x b k k typically we treat this as a function in the variable x and think of b as being fixed however one could also fix x and consider t bnf x as a function of b instead for functor calculus this point of view provides a way to think about taylor towers for functors on categories of objects that naturally live under a fixed object as opposed to over a fixed object in the setting of goodwillie s functor calculus expanding a taylor tower about an object b entails working with objects x that all come equipped with a morphism to the fixed object b however in some contexts such as that of k algebras for a fixed ring spectrum k it is more natural to consider objects x that come with a morphism k x from the fixed object k in this paper we work with taylor towers from this perspective for a functor f a c s from a category of objects under a fixed object a and an object f a x in a c we define vnf f a x as the nth term in a varying center tower for f that is the analogue in the functor calculus context of the function obtained from t bnf x by fixing x and varying the center of expansion b the tower vnf is strikingly different from the tower f nf described earlier the nth term is constructed from the degree n functors f nf by using all choices of functors f n simultaneously see definition 3 8 in brief we define vnf f a x by vnf f a x f nf a combinatorial models for taylor polynomials of functors 3 the analogous functions t bnf x when considered as a function of b need not be polynomial see remark 3 and we do not expect vnf to be a degree n functor either however we note that just as is the case for functions see remark 2 the tower vnf exhibits peculiar convergence behavior it approximates the constant functor with value f a rather than the functor f itself goodwillie and waldhausen proposed that a tower like this varying center tower for the forgetful functor u from rational commutative ring spectra to s modules that is from ring spectra under hq should play the role of the de rham complex for rational commutative ring spectra we refer to v u as the goodwillie waldhausen model for the de rham complex we explain why this is a reasonable model for the de rham complex in the case of rational algebras in section 3 4 of this paper in particular for a fixed simplicial rational algebra f q b and object q x b that factors f let drnx b denote the de rham complex truncated at the nth stage drnx b 0 0 n x b 2 x b 1 x b b we show that as a functor ofx dr n x b f nu x where u is the forgetful functor from algebras to modules this implies that the n truncated de rham complex drn q b is vnu b the model for the de rham complex of a rational ring spectrum used by rezk in unpublished work 21 is the cosimplicial ring spectrum b hq sk 1 here sk 1 is the 1 skeleton of the standard simplices n as sembled into a cosimplicial simplicial set the tensor product symbol hq denotes a coproduct and is a generalization of the join construction cf theorem 4 6 for a finite set u b hq u is the coproduct of u copies of b along the morphism hq b for rational algebras a b rezk ana lyzed the homotopy spectral sequence of the cosimplicial object b ask 1 when the map a b is a smooth morphism ofhq algebras he determined that the e 2 page of this spectral sequence is essentially the de rham com plex and that there are no non trivial differentials after this page using this he shows that b a sk 1 is isomorphic to the de rham cohomol ogy of the smooth map a b of rational commutative algebras we refer to b hq sk 1 as the combinatorial model for the de rham complex the combinatorial and goodwillie waldhausen models for the de rham complex of a smooth map of rational algebras both have natural extensions to suitable categories of e algebras because crystalline cohomology is closely related to the de rham complex it is expected that a good gen eralization of the de rham complex to e algebras would also be useful for modelling crystalline cohomology analogues more generally however two models for the de rham complex of e algebras need not be the same just because they agree rationally thus the question this paper seeks to address is whether or not the rational agreement of these two models for 4 k bauer r eldred b johnson and r mccarthy the de rham complex remains when the models are extended to all e algebras hence providing evidence that either of these may be regarded as candidates to model the de rham complex of a map of e algebras we prove that not only rationally but also for all e algebras the combinato rial and goodwillie waldhausen models for the de rham complex agree in fact this equivalence is a special case of a much more general relationship that holds for a wide range of functors this relationship is established in theorem 4 6 in the statement of the theorem that follows denotes the geometric realization of a simplicial object and tot denotes the totalization of a cosimplicial object recall that a homotopy functor is a functor that preserves weak equivalences theorem 4 6 suppose that f c s is a homotopy functor where c is either top or s f a b is a c connected map in c and f x f f x whenever a x b is a factorization of f with x b connected if f commutes with the geometric realization functor that is the natural map f x f x is a weak equivalence for each simplicial object x then v f a b tot f b a skn whenever n c 1 we note that the condition that f commutes with the geometric realiza tion functor is a mild hypothesis for example 20 corollary 5 11 shows that this is satisfied by any n excisive functor to spectra which also com mutes with filtered colimits of finite complexes the forgetful functor u satisfies u x f u x whenever x b is a 1 connected map thus setting f u a hq and n 1 in this theorem yields the desired equivalence between the combinatorial model and the goodwillie waldhausen model for the de rham complex a key step in proving this theorem is the following proposition proposition 2 5 for each n 0 the cosimplicial simplicial sets skn are pro equivalent to the empty set thought of as a constant cosimplicial simplicial set with value in other words we view totk skn as approximating the empty set and by extension b a tot k skn as approximating a when combined with conditions that guarantee that the tower f k f x a skn converges theorem 4 6 is a direct consequence of theorem 4 4 which we state below this theorem relates the limit of the varying center tower vnf f a b to the totalization of the object obtained by evaluation of the limit of f nf on the approximation of a given by proposition 2 5 theorem 4 4 suppose that f commutes with realization f a b is a morphism in c and x is an object in cf for any n 0 the tower of combinatorial models for taylor polynomials of functors 5 spectra vkf f a b k 1 is pro equivalent to the tower of tot towers of spectra totm k 1 f kf x a skn k 1 for any integer m n 1 an immediate consequence of this theorem is that v f f a b tot f f x a skn since pro equivalences of towers imply that their homotopy inverse limits are weakly equivalent this theorem can be compared to theorem 4 0 2 of the second author s thesis 6 or the published work 5 which says that there are weak equiva lences pnf a tot k 1 n pnf x askn for each k and n where f is a homotopy functor which commutes with colimits and pnf is the nth term in goodwillie s taylor tower for f there is an equivalence pnf a f nf a where f a x see 1 6 8 6 9 together with the fact that the tower vnf is constructed using all possible choices of the functors f nf simul taneously it is not surprising that there is a similarity between 6 theorem 4 0 2 and theorem 4 4 however just as f nf is only a part of the con struction of the tower vnf the finite stage tot k 1 n pnf x a skn is only part of the tot tower considered in theorem 4 4 we also extend theorem 4 6 to functors from arbitrary simplicial model categories c to spectra corollary 4 8 let c be a simplicial model category and let f c s be a homotopy functor that commutes with the geometric realization functor let f a b be a morphism in c and x be an object in c with morphisms a x b that factor f suppose there exists an n 0 for which we have an equivalence f x a skn k f f x a skn k for all cosimplicial degrees k 0 then tot f x a skn v f f a b the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we review basic results about simplicial and cosimplicial objects and prove proposition 2 5 in addi tion we review some ideas concerning pro equivalences of towers associated to cosimplicial objects we review the construction and basic properties of the taylor tower of 1 in section 3 we then use this taylor tower to define the varying center towers vnf described earlier in this introduction we finish section 3 by explaining why the de rham complex can be treated as a varying center tower for the functor u we devote the final section of the paper to proofs of theorems 4 4 and 4 6 and corollary 4 8 6 k bauer r eldred b johnson and r mccarthy acknowledgments we are

because of the generosity and hospitality of the following the mid west topology network funded by nsf grant dms 0844249 the union college faculty research fund the pacific institute for the mathematical sciences and the mathematics department of the university of illinois at urbana champaign we thank them for their support we would like to thank charles rezk for several helpful conversations we also thank tom goodwillie for his ideas that contributed to the development of section 3 2 cosimplicial objects and tot in this paper we provide a combinatorial model for the limit of a certain tower of degree n approximations to a homotopy functor in this section we provide relevant background on simplicial and cosimplicial objects we demonstrate how the empty set can be obtained from n connected spaces in a systematic way in proposition 2 5 this seemingly simple fact about cosim plicial spaces leads to the equivalence of theorem 4 6 we review towers of objects associated to cosimplicial objects and introduce pro equivalences between these as our preferred notion of equivalence for towers we finish the section by recording a useful lemma concerning multicosimplicial ob jects for an introduction to simplicial and cosimplicial objects the reader is referred to 2 and 9 let be the category of non empty finite totally ordered sets and order preserving functions a cosimplicial object in any category c is a covariant functor x c let xm denote the value of x at m 0 1 m morphisms of cosimplicial objects in c are natural transformations of func tors the category of cosimplicial objects and natural transformations be tween them is denoted c dually a simplicial object is a contravariant functor y c and its kth object is yk in this section the category c will be one of simplicial sets spaces or spectra s depending on the con text the model category of unpointed simplicial sets will be the usual one as in 13 definition 7 10 7 we require our category of unpointed topological spaces to satisfy the criteria set out in 13 7 10 2 and we use the model category structure explained in 13 definition 7 10 6 by spec tra we mean a suitable model category of spectra with symmetric monoidal smash product such as the ones defined in 16 or 8 we make use of the standard cosimplicial simplicial set given by nk hom k n by taking the geometric realization of this cosimplicial simplicial set in each cosimplicial degree we obtain a cosimplicial space which we denote definition 2 1 the totalization of any cosimplicial object x is totx holim x combinatorial models for taylor polynomials of functors 7 we take this as the definition of the totalization because it is homotopy invariant we will assume that in this paper we have selected functorial ho motopy limits everywhere satisfying the conditions enumerated in 1 lemma 2 5 in many situations it is convenient to use a particular model for the homotopy limit defining tot see e g 2 this leads to an alternate de scription of the totalization as totx homc x where hom denotes the appropriate function complex in particular if x is a fibrant object in c with the reedy model structure see 13 there is a weak equivalence totx totx as in 9 lemma 2 12 the latter part of this equivalence is often taken as the definition of the totalization we can filter by full subcategories r consisting of sets with at most r 1 elements the inclusion ir r induces a truncation functor c c r given by sending x to its restriction x ir the totalization of x inherits a filtration from definition 2 2 the rth totalization of a cosimplicial object x is totr x holim r x ir the functors totr assemble into a tower totr x totr 1 x for r 1 we denote this tower by totx totr x r 0 we set totr x homc skr x where skn y denotes the n skeleton of a simplicial space as in section iv 3 2 of 9 this is a model for totr x in the same way that totx is a model for totx in particular if x is reedy fibrant we have totr x totr x to compare two cosimplicial objects x and y we could ask when a map f x y yields an equivalence in the reedy model structure on cosimplicial spaces or spectra weak equivalences are defined to be levelwise equivalences xn y n for each n 0 this notion is too strong for our purposes we could instead ask that the associated map totx toty is a weak equivalence in the category c however this notion misses the topology coming from the inverse limit tower to incorporate the structure of the tot tower in equivalences of cosimplicial objects we want equivalences which are weaker than reedy equivalences but stronger than equivalences in c definition 2 3 2 chapter iii a map of towers fs as bs in any category is a pro isomorphism if for each s there is a t and a map 8 k bauer r eldred b johnson and r mccarthy bs t as making the following diagram commute as t fs t bs t as fs bs for pointed towers of connected spaces or spectra a map of towers is a weak pro homotopy equivalence if it induces a pro isomorphism of sets on 0 and a pro isomorphism of groups on n for each n q we will shorten weak pro homotopy equivalence to pro equivalence a pro equivalence of tot towers totx toty automatically induces a weak equivalence of objects totx toty see 2 chapter iii prop 2 6 but need not have totr x totr y for any r on the other hand if there is a weak equivalence totr x totr y for all r n then the towers totx and toty are automatically pro equivalent the next few results show that the cosimplicial spaces skn approximate the empty set by n connected spaces in a systematic way lemma 2 4 let n 0 the space totk skn satisfies totk skn for all k n 1 proof an element of totkskn can be treated as a sequence of maps i skk i skn i that commutes with the cosimplicial face and degeneracy maps we claim that no such sequence can exist when k n 1 to see why suppose that we have a commuting diagram 3 n di n n 1 n 1 skn n d i skn n 1 where the horizontal maps di are any of the n 2 cosimplicial face maps since the i s are required to commute with the cosimplicial structure maps n 1 restricted to the boundary of n 1 is required to be homotopic to the identity map however this is impossible since n 1 extends to n 1 dn 1 meaning that n 1 is contractible since there are no contractible maps whose image is all of the n sphere skn n 1 this shows that homc skn is empty since skk n n whenever k n the same argument also shows that homc skk skn is empty whenever k n 1 combinatorial models for taylor polynomials of functors 9 proposition 2 5 for each n 0 the cosimplicial simplicial sets skn are pro equivalent to the empty set thought of as a constant cosimplicial simplicial set with value moreover we have totk skn whenever k n 1 remark 2 6 note that skn is not a fibrant cosimplicial simplicial set therefore lemma 2 4 and proposition 2 5 are distinct statements proof of proposition 2 5 suppose that x is a simplicial set to show that x it suffices to show that the realization of the simplicial set x this is sufficient because the realization of a non empty simplicial set must be non empty we apply this to the simplicial set x tot k skn the geometric realization commutes with finite limits 9 chapter i prop 2 4 or 15 prop 3 2 3 and by using reedy fibrant replacement one sees that it also commutes with finite homotopy limits such as totk we obtain totk skn tot k skn by 13 theorem 19 8 4 2 we have a natural weak equivalence totk skn tot k skn tot k skn by lemma 2 4 the right hand side is equal to the conclusion follows by noting that the only space weakly equivalent to the empty set is the empty set itself we end this section with a kind of cosimplicial eilenberg zilber theorem a k multicosimplicial object in c is a functor x from k the k fold prod uct of the category with itself to c the diagonal cosimplicial object diagx is obtained from x by precomposing with the diagonal functor k let tot j i denote the homotopy limit holim j x taken in the i th variable only lemma 2 7 14 the diagonal functor preserves reedy fibrations in par ticular if x is a reedy fibrant multicosimplicial object of c then diagx is a reedy fibrant cosimplicial object of c this lemma implies that the diagonal is well behaved with respect to taking homotopy limits in particular it implies that if x y is a reedy weak equivalence of reedy fibrant multicosimplicial objects then holimi diagx holimi diag y for any indexing category i the following lemma appears as 6 lemma 3 3 where it is proved in the case where c is the category of simplicial sets the proof presented there works for any category c enriched over simplicial sets 10 k bauer r eldred b johnson and r mccarthy lemma 2 8 6 lemma 3 3 let x be a k multicosimplicial object in c then totn 11 tot nk k x totn diag cskn 11 csk nk k x where n n 1 nk and csk ni i x is the ni th coskeleton of x in the i th variable for all 1 i k these two lemmas immediately imply the following proposition which is a cosimplicial version of the eilenberg zilber theorem proposition 2 9 let x be a reedy fibrant k multicosimplicial object of c such that x cskn 11 csk nk k x is a reedy weak equivalence then tot n 1 1 tot nk k x tot n diagx where n n 1 nk 3 calculus for functors of a c the main results of this paper which we prove in section 4 are stated in terms of the varying center tower for functors whose source categories are categories whose objects live naturally under a fixed initial object the primary goal of this section is to define these towers and explain how they are related to taylor towers i e the towers of functors described in the second paragraph of the introduction existing models for taylor towers use categories whose objects live naturally over a fixed terminal object the definition of the varying center tower will use the discrete taylor tower f nf of 1 which is defined for functors whose source categories consist of objects that factor a fixed morphism f to construct the varying center tower we combine the discrete taylor towers corresponding to all possible values of f in section 3 1 we review these discrete taylor towers let a c be the category of objects in a simplicial model category c under a fixed object a with morphisms given by commuting triangles as part of the process of extending the construction of section 3 1 to the category a c in section 3 2 we explain how the new varying center tower serves as an analogue of the series obtained by fixing the variable of a taylor series and allowing the center of expansion to vary the construction of the varying center tower is carried out in section 3 3 we conclude the section by describing how the de rham complex can be viewed as an example of one of these varying center towers throughout this section we let c be a simplicial model category s be a category of spectra and be the initial final object in s we assume that all functors are homotopy functors that is that they preserve weak equivalences combinatorial models for taylor polynomials of functors 11 3 1 taylor towers for cf let f a b be a morphism in c and let cf be the category whose objects factor the map f the objects of cf are triples x x x where x is an object of c and x a x and x x b are morphisms such that x x f when the maps x and x are understood we use x to denote the triple x x x morphisms are given by the obvious commuting diagrams in order for our constructions to be homotopy invariant we assume that all objects of cf are cofibrant i e that f a b is a cofibration in c and each x is a cofibration to review existing taylor towers for functors from cf we begin by sum marizing the two notions of polynomial degree n functors considered in 1 and 10 respectively for full details see sections 3 4 and 4 of 1 and sec tion 3 of 10 the first notion depends on cross effects functors let a denote the coproduct in cf recall that an n cubical diagram in a category d is a functor from the power set p n of n 1 n to d definition 3 1 1 definition 3 4 let x be an n tuple x 1 xn of objects in cf let n x b p n s be the n cubical diagram defined on s n by n xb s x 1 b s a a xnb s where xib s xi when i s and x i b s b otherwise if s t the morphism n x b s t is induced by the maps xi on summands xib s with i t s and identity maps on summands with i s if f cf s the nth cross effect of f relative to f evaluated at x cr f nf x 1 xn is the iterated homotopy fiber see 1 definition 3 2 of the cubical diagram obtained by applying f to n x b since the n cubical diagram n x b and the homotopy fiber are functorial in x this defines a functor cr f nf c n f s called the nth cross effect functor when n 2 the 2 cubical diagram 2 x b of definition 3 1 is simply the square diagram x 1 ax 2 1 x 2 x 1 1 x 1 ab x 1 1 b ax 2 1 x 2 b ab and cr 2 f x 1 x 2 is the iterated homotopy fiber of the diagram obtained by applying f to this square definition 3 2 1 definition 3 21 a functor f cf s is degree n relative to f a b provided that cr f n 1 f we note that this condition was simply called degree n in 1 12 k bauer r eldred b johnson and r mccarthy this is a weaker condition than the n excisive condition satisfied by the nth term in goodwillie s taylor tower defined as follows definition 3 3 10 definition 3 1 a functor f d s where d is c a c or cf is n excisive provided that when f is applied to any strongly cocartesian n 1 cubical diagram p n d the result is a homotopy cartesian diagram in s the properties of degree n relative to f and n excisive are related by the following definition and proposition definition 3 4 1 definition 4 2 a functor f d s where d is c a c or cf is n excisive relative to a provided that when f is applied to any strongly cocartesian n 1 cubical diagram p n d with a the result is a homotopy cartesian diagram in s proposition 3 5 1 propositions 4 3 4 11 let f a b and let f cf s 1 the functor f is degree n relative to f if and only if f is n excisive relative to a 2 if f commutes with realizations that is if the natural map f x f x is an equivalence for all simplicial objects x then f is n excisive relative to a if and only if f is n excisive the functor n f obtained by precomposing cr f n 1 f with the diagonal f n f x cr f nf x x forms a cotriple or comonad on the category of homotopy functors from cf to s 1 theorem 3 17 standard results about cotriples yield a simplicial spectrum f n 1 1 f x whose kth spectrum is given by iterating the diagonal cross effects construction k 1 times one can then define fnf x hocof f n 1 1 f x f x as in 1 definition 5 3 these functors assemble into the tower in diagram 1 of functors and natural transformations 1 theorem 5 8 and satisfy 1 f nf is degree n relative to f 1 proposition 5 4 2 f nf is universal up to weak equivalence among functors that are degree n relative to f and have natural transformations from f 1 proposition 5 6 we now turn our attention to goodwillie s construction in 1 section 6 1 we extended goodwillie s construction of taylor towers for functors of spaces or spectra 11 section 1 to functors f cf s as follows for any finite set u of cardinality u and object x in cf let b xu be the homotopy colimit over u copies of the map x x b out of a single domain x this is a generalization of the fiberwise join construction found in 11 section 1 denoted there as x b u the nth term in goodwillie s taylor tower is combinatorial models for taylor polynomials of functors 13 given by 4 pnf x hocolimk t k nf x where tnf x holimu p 0 n 1 f b x u and the homotopy inverse limit is taken over p 0 n 1 the partially ordered set of non empty subsets of 1 n 1 when evaluated at the initial object a of cf we show that f nf a agrees with goodwillie s n excisive polynomial functor pnf a theorem 3 6 1 corollary 6 8 theorem 6 9 let f cf s there is a weak homotopy equivalence of spectra f nf a pnf a moreover if f commutes with realization then for any object x in cf there is a weak homotopy equivalence of spectra f nf x pnf x this weak homotopy equivalence allows us to apply results of 11 to the functor nf for example we have the following proposition which provides a classification of the homogeneous layers proposition 3 7 let f cf s and x be an object in cf suppose that f commutes with the geometric realization functor or that x a let f nf x denote the homotopy fiber of the natural map q f n f nf x f n 1 f x then there exists a functor of n variables l f nf cf n s such that 1 l f nf is degree 1 relative to f in each variable 2 l f nf is n reduced that is it is equivalent to when evaluated at b in any of its variables 3 for any permutation n there is a natural weak equivalence l fnf x 1 x n l f nf x 1 xn and 4 when evaluated at x f nf x is equivalent to l fnf x x h n where h n denotes the homotopy orbits with respect to the natural n action that permutes the variables of l f nf proof goodwillie s proof of theorem 4 1 and corollary 4 2 in 11 can be applied to the constructions y xu tnf and pnf as we have defined them above this proves the stated result since pnf x f nf x under either hypothesis 3 2 motivation from the taylor series of a function for a morphism f a b we have defined f nf to be the degree n approximation to f relative to f we consider this to be analogous to a degree n polynomial approximation t bnf x of equation 2 where a x plays the role of x and b plays the role of b the object b should be viewed as a center of expansion for f nf in the following sense in contexts where we can measure 14 k bauer r eldred b johnson and r mccarthy the connectivity of a map x b such as spaces or spectra for a suitably nice functor f the functor f nf approximates f in the sense that if the map x b is k connected for k above some constant that depends on f then the map f x f nf x is on the order of n 1 k connected that is for objects that are within some distance of b homotopically f nf x is an approximation to f x that improves as n increases see for example 11 proposition 1 6 we make three observations about the taylor series of a function f that motivate our study of polynomial approximations for functors from cate gories of objects under a fixed initial object observation 1 in considering t bnf we can change our perspective from x to b that is we can view t bnf x as a function of b by evaluating at a fixed x say x 0 for simplicity tnf b t b nf 0 n k 0 f k b 1 k b k k in definition 3 8 we explain how to implement this observation for functors observation 2 when we shift our focus from x to b we observe that tnf b is not trying to approximate the function f but only the discrete value f 0 in particular tnf b f 0 for b 6 0 if and only if f n 1 b 0 for all b for if f 0 n k 0 f k b 1 k b k k then differentiating both sides with respect to b yields 0 n k 0 f k 1 b 1 kbk k f k b 1 kbk 1 k 1 this is a telescoping sum and hence we obtain f n 1 b 1 nbn n 0 if b is non zero then this equation holds if f n 1 b 0 thus tnf b f 0 if and only if f is a polynomial of degree n compare this to proposition 3 14 observation 3 when considered as a function of b with x 0 fixed tnf b is not necessarily a degree n polynomial function in b as a simple example consider the function with f x x 3 then t 2 f b b 3 3 b 2 b 3 b b 2 b 3 which is a degree 3 polynomial in b rather than the expected quadratic polynomial in fact tnf b need not even be polynomial in b as is seen by considering the function f x ex compare this to example 3 13 the varying center tower was constructed with these three observations in mind since defining the nth polynomial approximation for a functor f a c s means letting b vary combinatorial models for taylor polynomials of functors 15 3 3 varying center towers in this section we will define a tower of functors vnf which act like an approximation tower for the object f a in the same way the tnf b s form a sequence of functions which approximates f 0 as in observation 2 as the terms vnf need not be polynomial nor approximations of the functor f we will call this new sequence the varying center tower and not a taylor tower for f a c s let f cf a c be the forgetful functor that sends x x x to x a x similar to from section 4 11 a functor f a c s can be restricted to the functor ff cf s defined by ff f f we often suppress f and abuse notation by writing f instead of ff when the context is clear let a a 1 a f denote the initial object of cf definition 3 8 the nth term in the varying center tower for the functor f a c s evaluated at the object f a b is vnf f a b f n ff a lemma 3 9 the nth term of the varying center tower vnf is a functor from a c to s whenever f a c s proof in order to show vnf is a functor we need to define it for each morphism from f to g a f g b c let cf cg be the functor that is obtained by post composition with that is x x x x x x recall that f n ff a is the homotopy cofiber of the map f n 1 1 ff a ff a the morphism f g induces a morphism of the n 1 cubes that define f n 1 ff and g n 1 gf this induces a map f n 1 ff a g n 1 gf a on the total homotopy fibers of these cubes after the functor f has been applied to them this in turn induces the map a c n f of cofibers in the commuting diagram f n 1 ff a f a f n ff a g n 1 gf a f a g n gf a 16 k bauer r eldred b johnson and r mccarthy since vnf f a b f n ff a and vnf g a c g n gf a this defines vnf the fact that preserves compositions and identities on the underlying n 1 cubes ensures that vnf does as well the functors f nf assemble into a tower of functors via natural transfor mations q f n f nf f n 1 f these natural transformations can be used to assemble vnf into a tower of functors as well justifying our use of the term varying center tower lemma 3 10 there are natural transformations n vnf vn 1 f proof for each object f a b of a c the map q f n f nf f n 1 f induces a natural transformation qfn f n ff f n 1 ff these assemble into a natural transformation n vnf vn 1 f because any morphism f g in a c induces a commuting diagram f n ff a q f n g n gf a q g n f n 1 ff a g n 1 gf a to verify that this square commutes use to define maps between the cubes involved in the construction of q f n and q g n see 5 of 1 for details next we turn to understanding what role the notion of the degree of a functor plays in this context the first step is to define degree n for functors of a c we then establish the analogue of proposition 3 5 for functors from a c definition 3 11 a functor f a c s is degree n relative to a provided that for all objects f a b in a c ff cf s is degree n relative to f see definition 3 2 proposition 3 12 the functor f a c s is degree n relative to a if and only if f is n excisive relative to a if f commutes with realizations then f is degree n relative to a if and only if f is n excisive proof let n denote the map in p n which is the inclusion of the empty set into the set n for any cubical diagram p n a c the choice f n a n n provides us with an object f of a c with the property that the cubical diagram can be viewed as a cubical diagram in cf combinatorial models for taylor polynomials of functors 17 suppose that f is degree n relative to a let be any strongly cocartesian n 1 cubical diagram in a c with initial object a by assumption f is degree n relative to f and is an n 1 cubical diagram in cf by proposition 3 5 f takes to a cartesian diagram and so f is n excisive relative to a conversely if f is n excisive relative to a as a functor of a c then by restriction it is n excisive relative to a as a functor of cf for any f a b in c proposition 3 5 guarantees that f is degree n relative to f the proof of the second part of the theorem is similar as is the case for taylor series of functions cf remark 3 we do not expect vnf to be a degree n functor of a c the next example demonstrates that vnf is not necessarily degree n even in degree 0 example 3 13 let f a c s then v 0 f f a b f 0 f a the latter is calculated using the first cross effect functor cr f 1 f x hofib f x f b for any x cf including x a since cr n 1 f x cr 1 f x for all n 1 the degree 0 approximation f 0 f a is defined by taking the homo topy cofiber of cr 1 f a f a but the homotopy fiber sequence cr 1 f a f a f b defining cr 1 f is also a cofiber sequence in sequence in spectra hence f 0 f a f b thus v 0 f f a b f b for all a b in a c but this functor is not degree 0 as a functor of b i e it is not constant if f is not constant in fact it will not even have finite degree if f is not finite degree however even though vnf may not have finite degree starting with a degree n functor ensures that the varying center tower vnf vn 1 f v 0 f converges to the constant functor fa i e given a functor f a c s fa a c s is the functor satisfying fa f a b f id a a for all f a b in a c proposition 3 14 let f a c s if f is degree n relative to a then the natural transformation ff f n ff evaluated at a induces a weak equivalence fa vkf for all k n 18 k bauer r eldred b johnson and r mccarthy proof consider f a b by assumption ff is degree n relative to f by proposition 3 22 of 1 ff is degree k relative to f for all k n then by proposition 5 6 of 1 f k ff ff and so vkf f a b f k ff a ff a f a this allows us to consider what happens as n increases definition 3 15 let f a c s we say that the tower vnf f converges at f if the constant functor fa is homotopy equivalent to the limit v f f holimn vnf f the preceding proposition tells us that if f is degree n relative to a then vnf is equivalent to the constant functor with value f a for all f a b in a c thus the calculus tower vnf is trying to approximate the value of f at the initial object a just as the taylor polynomials approximated the initial value f 0 when we allowed the center to become the variable in remark 2 this is a departure from the usual the taylor towers of 11 17 and 1 for functors f under certain conditions can be treated as approximations to the functor f rather than a constant functor given by a particular value of f for functors g from the category of unbased topological spaces this means that vng is trying to approximate the value of g on the empty set the initial object in the category of unbased spaces 3 4 the de rham complex as a varying center tower we finish this section by justifying the claim made in the introduction that for rational algebras the de rham complex is the varying center tower for the forgetful functor from rational algebras to modules we begin by describing the functors and categories we use to do so we use commq to denote the category of commutative rational algebras and s commq to denote the category of simplicial objects in commq in particular let q denote the constant simplicial object in s commq that is q in each simplicial let u denote the forgetful functor from commq to the category of q modules we can extend this to a functor from s commq to simplicial q modules by applying u degreewise recall that for a morphism of rational algebras f x b the de rham complex drxb is the cochain complex of exterior algebras of the ka hler differentials 3 b x 2 b x b x b see 23 sections 8 8 1 and 9 8 9 for further details the construction is natural in maps f x b so given a map of simplicial algebras f x b we can construct a simplicial cochain complex whose kth object is drxkbk let drx b denote the associated second quadrant bicomplex obtained via normalization for a fixed b in s commq the functor dr b x b 7 drx b is a functor whose source category is the category of simplicial rational algebras over b however dr b is not in general a homotopy functor combinatorial models for taylor polynomials of functors 19 to remedy this we will assume that the map x b is a cofibration in s commq the total complex tot drx b is what we mean by the de rham complex of f x b as the columns of drx b correspond to the exterior algebra terms in the de rham complex and the filtration of drx b by columns converges to tot drx b however for ease of exposition we will usually suppress tot and work directly with the underlying bicomplex for a simplicial rational algebra over b x b we use dr n x b to denote the nth truncated de rham complex of x b i e the bicomplex whose first n 1 columns are the same as the first n 1 columns of drx b and whose columns are identically 0 thereafter drnx b 0 0 n x b 2 x b 1 x b b for a fixed rational algebra f q b we make use of the nth truncated de rham complex as a functor of s commq f as follows definition 3 16 let f q b be a morphism in s commq f the functor dr f n is a functor from s commq f to the category of rational chain complexes that takes the object x q x b to drfn x tot drnx b our goal is to outline a proof of the following unpublished result of good willie and waldhausen we learned of this result and method of proof from conversations with goodwillie proposition 3 17 for a rational algebra q b and its cofibrant replace ment q b vnu q b dr n q b our first step in justifying this claim is to describe a strategy for iden tifying vnf for a functor f a c s by definition 3 8 to identify vnf f a b for f a c s and an object f a b in a c we must find f nf and then determine the value of this functor at a viewed as the object a a b in cf when f commutes with realizations proposition 3 12 and a variant of proposition 1 6 of 11 provide a means of proving that a particular functor is equivalent to f nf more explicitly these results guarantee that we can determine vnf by first identifying for each f a b in a c a functor g f n cf s that is natural in f and satisfies the following 1 g f n cf s is n excisive and 2 there is a natural transformation ff g f n with the property that there are constants and c such that for any object a x b in cf where x b is k connected with k the induced morphism ff x g f n x is at least c n 1 k connected these conditions guarantee that g f n f nf as a functor of cf then vnf f a b g f nf a 20 k bauer r eldred b johnson and r mccarthy we apply this result to the case where c s commq a q and f u the forgetful functor of proposition 3 17 we claim that in this context the functor dr f n of definition 3 16 is the correct choice for the functor g f n described above thus to confirm proposition 3 17 it suffices to show that for any cofibrant object f q b in s commq 1 dr f n is n excisive as a functor of s commq f and 2 for an object x q x b in s commq f where x b is k connected with k 1 u x dr f nx is at least n 1 k n 1 connected the natural map u x dr f n x is the map that is f x b in the 0 th level of the complex and 0 elsewhere we describe how to do this in what follows we begin by explaining why condition 1 holds in the case n 1 for morphisms of commutative rational algebras x b one can verify that the functor x b 7 1 b x is 1 excisive and reduced by first recalling that 1 b x is isomorphic to i i 2 where i is the kernel of the map b x b b 23 9 2 4 the functor i i 2 is equal to the composition k k 2 e where e is the functor from commq to the category of augmented rational algebras that takes q x b to b b x b b and k b y b is the augmentation ideal functor from augmented rational algebras to rational modules the functor e preserves cocartesian diagrams and the functor k k 2 is known to be linear see for example 17 18 12 this implies that dr f 1 is degree 1 for n 1 the fact that x b 7 1 b x is 1 excisive and reduced also tells us that x b 7 n b x is a homogeneous degree n functor in particular this holds because n b x is the n fold exterior power of 1 b x as such it is given by the orbits of the canonical action of the nth symmetric group n and hence homotopy orbits since we are working rationally of a multilinear functor of n variables by fundamental results of goodwillie see 11 or 19 we know that functors of this form are homogeneous of degree n as a result the functor dr f n is degree n to see that 2 holds consider an object in s commq f q x b where x b is k connected for some k 1 consider the map of bicomplexes trn drx b dr n x b which truncates the de rham complex at the nth column we note that any k connected cofibration f has a factorization x f b b where the map f is a cofibration an isomorphism in dimensions up to k and an injection in dimension k 1 thus since dr b and dr n b are homotopy functors we can assume that our k connected cofibration has combinatorial models for taylor polynomials of functors 21 the same form as f as a result 1 bi xi is zero for 0 i k and in turn m bi xi is zero for 0 i mk using the fact that n b x is the nth exterior algebra of 1 b x taking the total complex we see that this means that trn drx b dr n x b is n 1 k n 1 connected we next claim that because k 1 tot drx b x this follows from the fact that when k 1 the resulting connectivity of the columns of drx b guarantees that the bicomplex is bounded and so tot drx b tot drx b since we are working rationally the poincare lemma tells us that themth row of drx b is equivalent toxm and so tot drx b x hence u x b dr f n x b is at least n 1 k n 1 connected given that conditions 1 and 2 hold we know that for f q b f nu dr f n evaluating at the initial object q that is q q b in s commq f gives us vnu f q b dr f n q dr n q b as predicted by proposition 3 17 the convergence of this tower when q b is a k connected cofibration with k 1 which will be addressed further in corollary 4 7 is now a restatement of the poincare lemma that is drqb q v u q b in this case a striking feature of the varying center tower is that v u is independent of b entirely when the tower converges 4 proof of main theorem the goal of this section is to prove theorem 4 4 which gives an equiva lence between the limit of the varying center tower v f f a b and the total space of the cosimplicial spectrum f f x a skn for any a x b that factors f we proceed inductively first proving results for linear functors then finite degree functors and then for limits of taylor towers the advantage of examining f f x a skn is that x a skn can be thought of as being more highly connected than x combined with a good notion of analyticity definition 4 5 this allows us to describe v f f a b more succinctly as tot f b a skn avoiding the need to calculate the taylor tower f nf at all for spaces where the no tion of connectivity is well understood this is made precise in theorem 4 6 the general form of this result for arbitrary model categories is stated in corollary 4 8 let f a b be any object of a c let a x b be any factoriza tion of f so that x a x b is an object of cf in this section we work with functors f d s where d is a c or cf when starting with f a c s we will also use f to represent the functor ff cf s as defined in section 3 3 as in the previous section we assume that f is a homotopy functor and c is a simplicial model category when applying f 22 k bauer r eldred b johnson and r mccarthy to simplicial or cosimplicial objects in d f will be applied degreewise in section 3 we defined b a u for a morphism f a b in cf and a finite set u it is the colimit of u copies of b added along a via the maps f this can be generalized to cosimplicial simplicial sets z by using znk in place of u the various face degeneracy coface and codegeneracy maps involved become insertions and fold maps throughout this section we write for the constant cosimplicial simplicial set that is empty in each simplicial and cosimplicial degree thus a x a is a constant cosimplicial simplicial object of c the inclusion map skn induces a map of cosimplicial simplicial c objects a x a skn where a denotes the constant cosim plicial simplicial object this map induces a weak equivalence of spectra when a functor f of finite degree is applied to it as is proved in the next few propositions proposition 4 1 if f cf s is degree 1 relative to f then for all x in cf there is a weak homotopy equivalence f a totm f x a skn for all m n 1 thus if f a c s is degree 1 relative to a then for all f a b in a c and a x b in cf there is a pro equivalence of towers totf a tot f x a skn when f commutes with realizations the case m n 1 can be de duced from proposition 3 0 3 of 6 using the fact that in this case f a t 1 f a however the results of 6 do not extend to a pro equivalence of towers proof we claim that f x au f x f a u for any finite non empty set u first note that if u has exactly one element then f x a u f x f x f a u for u n consider the n cube x a with x a t x a t for subsets t u this is a strongly cocartesian n cube by proposition 3 22 of 1 and proposition 3 5 f is k excisive rel ative to a for all k 1 as a result f x a is a cartesian n cube since f takes values in spectra f x a is also cocartesian by induction for each t n with t 6 n f x a t f x f a t since f x a is cocartesian this implies that 5 f x a n hocolim t n t 6 n f x a t hocolim t n t 6 n f x f a t f x f a n now f a f x f a as constant cosimplicial simplicial spectra so we have equivalences of cosimplicial simplicial spectra f a f x f a f x f a tot m skn combinatorial models for taylor polynomials of functors 23 whenever m n 1 by proposition 2 5 suppose that f a the base point in the category s in s the coproduct f x u u f x is weakly equivalent to a product the functor totm commutes with products so we have an equivalence of simplicial spectra f a totm f x skn where the left hand side is a constant simplicial spectrum upon taking the geometric realization we obtain the equivalence totm f x skn tot m f x skn since geometric realizations commute with finite homotopy limits such as totm in s since f is 1 excisive relative to a this is equivalent to totm f x skn by 5 since this holds for every m n 1 we obtain the desired pro equivalence tot tot f x skn now if f a 6 form the reduced functor f by f x hocofiber f a f x note that if f is degree 1 relative to f then so is f furthermore f a since geometric realization and the functor totm preserve co fibration sequences of spectra we have a co fibration sequence f a totm f x a skn totm f x a skn by the previous case totm f x a skn whenever m n 1 the result follows it is also possible to prove proposition 4 1 by constructing explicit cosim plicial homotopies to show that tot f x a skn in the case that f a the conclusion of proposition 4 1 can be reformulated as a statement about the coskeleta of the cosimplicial simplicial spectrum f x a skn let z be any cosimplicial object the kth matching object of z is defined by mkz lim k 1 t xt where k 1 t is a surjection in with t k see 9 vii 4 for details in particular this means that cskn z k zk k n mk 1 z in k n where the restriction z in is as discussed in definition 2 2 note that in particular cskn z n 1 mnz corollary 4 2 if f is degree 1 relative to f then for all x in cf and all m n 1 we have a levelwise equivalence of cosimplicial simplicial spectra f x a skn csk m f x a skn 24 k bauer r eldred b johnson and r mccarthy proof for any cosimplicial spectrum and any m 1 there is a pullback square totm z hom m zm totm 1 z hom m zm hom m mm 1 z hom m mm 1 z where hom is the enriched hom in spectra from this pullback square it is possible to show that hofib totm z totm 1 z m hofib zm mm 1 z see 9 viii 1 or 7 for full details when z f x a skn proposition 4 1 implies that totm z totm 1 z is an equivalence for all m n 1 since f is a functor to spectra we can conclude that zm mm 1 z is an equivalence for all m n 1 as well the rest of the proof follows by induction we next consider the case of a functor that is degree k relative to f recall that under the hypothesis that f commutes with realizations this is the same as saying that f is k excisive proposition 3 5 proposition 4 3 let f a c s be a functor that commutes with realizations let f a b and let x be any object in cf for all k 1 and n 0 the map vkf f f k f a tott f k f x a skn is an equivalence of spectra for each t n 1 k thus there is a pro equivalence of towers totvkf f tot f kf x a skn proof we establish first that we have a pro equivalence of cosimplicial spec tra tot f k f a tot f k f x a skn where f kf is the fiber of the natural transformation q f k f kf f k 1 f let l f kf be the multilinear functor of k variables associated to f kf by proposition 3 7 denote the evaluation on the diagonal l f kf x x by l f kf x since f commutes with realizations proposition 3 7 guarantees that f kf x l f kf x h k fix objects x 1 xk 1 for the first k 1 variables of l f kf and consider the single variable functor l f kf x 1 xk 1 since l f kf is linear in each variable proposition 4 1 implies that we have a weak equivalence of spectra l f kf x 1 xk 1 a tot m l f kf x 1 xk 1 x a skn combinatorial models for taylor polynomials of functors 25 for each xi cf and each m n 1 we repeat this process in each variable separately to obtain a similar equivalence for each of the k variables by corollary 4 2 and proposition 2 9 these equivalences assemble to l f kf a tot mk l f kf x a skn for any m n 1 and any x cf in the category s finite homotopy limits commute with finite homotopy colimits the partial totalization totmk is a finite homotopy limit so it commutes with the homotopy colimit that constructs the homotopy orbits of the k action in spectra we have l f kf a h k totmk l f kf x a skn h k totmk l f kf x a skn h k totmk l f kf x a skn h k whenever m n 1 the last equivalence follows from the fact that homo topy colimits commute thus we have a pro equivalence tot f kf a tot f kf x a skn for all k and n greater than or equal to 1 the proof of the proposition now follows by induction on k using the objectwise fibration sequence of functors f kf f kf f k 1 f the base case is given by proposition 4 1 since f 1 f is degree 1 the functors tott preserve homotopy fiber sequences so applying tott to this fibration sequence evaluated on the morphism a x a skn yields a commuting diagram f k f a f k f a f k 1 f a tott f k f x a skn tot t f k f x a skn tot t f k 1 f x a skn with fibration sequences in each row here we have used that tott z z when z is a constant cosimplicial object we have already shown that the left hand arrow is a weak equivalence whenever t n 1 k assuming that the right hand arrow is a weak equivalence whenever t n 1 k 1 we can conclude that the middle arrow is a weak equivalence whenever t n 1 k the pro equivalence of proposition 4 3 extends to a pro equivalence of the discrete calculus towers associated to each functor we prove this next 26 k bauer r eldred b johnson and r mccarthy theorem 4 4 suppose that f a c s commutes with realizations let f a b and let x be any object in cf for any n 0 the tower of spectra vkf f k 1 f kf a k 1 is pro equivalent to the tower of tot towers of spectra totm k 1 f kf x a skn k 1 proof for any k 0 and any m n 1 we have a commuting square f k 1 f a q f k 1 totm k 1 f k 1 f x a skn tot q f k 1 totm k 1 f k f x a skn b f k f a totmk f k f x a skn where q f n is the natural transformation from theorem and b is the usual fibration between stages of the tot tower the horizontal maps and are the maps induced by the inclusion skn from proposition 4 3 by the proof of proposition 4 3 and b are weak equivalences whenever m n 1 the map tot q f k 1 provides the diagonal map from definition 2 3 hence the towers are pro equivalent an immediate consequence of theorem 4 4 is that there is a weak equiv alence of spectra v f f tot f f x a skn obtained by taking the inverse limit of the towers in the statement of the the orem we can use this result to better understand the relationship between the limit of the varying center tower vnf and the functor f the last two results of the paper show that if f is analytic in the sense of definition 4 5 then v f is equivalent to the functor that takes a b to f b a skn in light of proposition 2 5 and since the map a b askn is induced by skn this tells us that the failure of the varying center tower vnf to converge is measured by the failure of f to commute with tot in the case of spaces or spectra we use corollary 1 4 of 5 to show that the equivalence between v f and f b a skn holds when f is a weakly analytic functor as defined below definition 4 5 let f c s where c is either top or s let f a b be a morphism in c we say that f is weakly analytic relative to f provided that for any object a x b in cf where x b is connected f x f f x combinatorial models for taylor polynomials of functors 27 this condition is related to goodwillie s stronger condition of analyticity see 10 for details in the sense that both conditions guarantee convergence of taylor towers in particular any analytic functor is also a weakly analytic functor theorem 4 6 suppose that f c s is a homotopy functor where c is either top or s f a b is a c connected map in c and f is weakly analytic relative to f if f commutes with realizations then there is a weak equivalence of spectra v f f tot f b a skn whenever n c 1 is a non negative integer proof in the category of spaces or spectra the product b au is the same as the join construction a b u of 11 for any finite set u from 11 we have the useful facts that a b u v a b u b v where u v is the ordinary join of two spaces and a b u b is at least m 1 connected if f a b is at least m connected and u is not empty thus if f a b is at least c connected then a b sk 0 k sk 0 k b is at least c n 1 connected where sk 0 k sk 0 k is the join of n 1 copies of sk 0 k with itself theorem 1 2 of 5 combined with remark 7 1 3 of 6 says that for any homotopy functor f there is a weak equivalence tot f a b sk 0 sk 0 tot f a b skn where sk 0 sk 0 denotes the join of n 1 copies of sk 0 with itself since f is weakly analytic for each k we have a weak equivalence f a b sk 0 k sk 0 k f f a b sk 0 k sk 0 k as long as n c 1 this levelwise equivalence of cosimplicial spec tra assembles to produce an equivalence of the associated total complexes putting this together with the aforementioned result from 5 and 6 we have a weak equivalence tot f a b skn tot f f a b skn the left hand side of this equivalence is tot f b a skn the right hand side is tot f f b a skn and the conclusion now follows from theorem 4 4 as a special case of theorem 4 6 we obtain the desired comparison of the goodwillie waldhausen and rezk constructions 28 k bauer r eldred b johnson and r mccarthy corollary 4 7 let u be the forgetful functor from rational commutative ring spectra to modules and let f q b be a morphism of rational commutative ring spectra then there is a weak equivalence v u q b tot b q sk 1 proof by the blakers massey theorem see 10 or 4 for spectra u is 1 analytic using this the result follows immediately from theorem 4 6 when b the usual terminal object of top or s theorem 4 6 fol lows more directly from theorem 4 4 in particular skn is at least n connected and hence a b skn b is at least n connected if f is weakly n analytic this is sufficient to conclude that f a b skn f f a b skn and so in this case theorem 4 6 follows immediately from theorem 4 4 more generally the condition that f be weakly analytic can be replaced with a condition dictating that f and f are equivalent on the objects x a skn k corollary 4 8 let f c s be a functor that commutes with realizations let f a b be a morphism in c and x be an object in cf suppose there exists an n 0 for which we have a weak equivalence of spectra f x a skn k f f x a skn k for all cosimplicial degrees k 0 then tot f x a skn f f a v f f a b proof the levelwise hypothesis of the statement guarantees that there is a weak equivalence of spectra tot f x a skn tot f f x a skn composing with the equivalence from theorem 4 4 we have f f a tot f x a skn which implies the result the key point in requiring the existence of n in corollary 4 8 is that the space skn k is at least n connected for all k so like the analyticity condi tion in theorem 4 6 the condition in this proposition requires convergence on analogues of n connected objects references 1 k bauer b johnson and r mccarthy with an appendix by
