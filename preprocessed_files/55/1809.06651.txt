my title ar x iv 1 80 9 06 65 1 v 1 m at h a t 1 8 s ep 2 01 8 quasi theories zhen huan abstract in this paper we define a family of theories quasi theories moti vated by quasi elliptic cohomology they can be defined from constant loop spaces with them the constructions on certain theories can be made in a neat way such as those on generalized tate k theories we set up quasi theories and discuss their properties 1 introduction in 8 3 4 we set up quasi elliptic cohomology qell g it is a variant of tate k theory which is the generalized elliptic cohomology theory associated to the tate curve tate q over specz q quasi elliptic cohomology is defined over specz q and has a direct interpretation in terms of the katz mazur group scheme t section 8 7 6 its relation with tate k theory is 1 1 qell g x z q z q k tate g x we can go a step further and consider the n th generalized tate k theory for each positive integer n it is defined over specz q n and its divisible group is gm q z n as shown in example 3 5 we can extend the idea of quasi elliptic cohomology and construct a theory qk n g over specz q n it can be expressed in terms of equivariant k theories in addition qk n g x z q n z q n is isomorphic to the n th generalized tate k theory k n tate g x as shown in definition 2 14 and definition 3 11 4 for each compact lie group g and g space x we can construct a groupoid x g consisting of constant loops in the free loop space lx from it we define quasi elliptic cohomology by qell g x k orb x g in definition 2 14 we discuss the composition n of this constant loop functor it defines qk n g x k orb n x g as shown in section 4 those constructions on quasi elliptic cohomology can all be applied to qk n g including restriction maps ku nneth map change of group isomorphism etc in a further paper we will also construct the power operation of 2010 mathematics subject classification primary 55 1 http arxiv org abs 1809 06651 v 1 2 zhen huan this theory and classify the level structure and finite subgroups of the corresponding divisible group we did that work for quasi elliptic cohomology theory in 2 more generally with the same loop space n x g we define a family of coho mology theories qe n with the k theory k replaced by any other equivariant theory e they are given the name quasi theories we show in a coming paper 5 that if e can be globalized then qe n can be globalized in section 2 we study the composition of the free loop functor and that of the loop functors from which we construct quasi elliptic cohomology in 4 especially we give a loop space construction of g equivariant generalized tate k theory for compact lie groups g in section 3 we define the quasi theories and discuss some examples in section 4 we present some properties of the quasi theories 1 1 acknowledgement first i would like to thank my phd advisor charles rezk he suggested this research project when i was a phd student at uiuc i would like to thank marc levine his questions on quasi elliptic cohomology during my visit at universita t duisburg essen helped me understand the subject and its nature more deeply i would like to thank chenchang zhu for showing me the relation between bibundles and stacks during her talk at sun yat sen university and during my visit at georg august universita t go ttingen and i would like to thank nathaniel stapleton for answering my questions nicely all the time 2 loop space models 2 1 the n th loop space via bibundles in 7 lerman discussed the construction of bibundles and showed the weak 2 category of lie groupoids with 1 arrows bibundles can be embeded into the 2 category of stacks which is a sub 2 category of the category of categories in 4 we construct a loop space via bibundles in this paper we study the n th power of it first we recall the definition of bibundles which is definition 3 25 7 definition 2 1 bibundles let g and h be two groupoids a bibundle from g to h is a manifold p together with two maps g 0 p al oo ar h 0 such that there is a left action of g on p with respect to al and a right action of h on p with respect to ar al p g 0 is a principal h bundle ar is g invariant ar g p ar p for all g p g 1 h 0 p the actions of g and h commute definition 2 2 bibundle maps a bibundle map is a map p p over h 0 g 0 which commutes with the g and h actions for each pair of lie groupoids h and g we have a category bibun h g with as objects bibundles from h to g and as morphisms the bundle maps example 2 3 bibun s 1 g a bibundle from s 1 to g with g a lie group is a smooth manifold p with al p s 1 a smooth principal g bundle and ar p a constant map thus a bibundle in this case is equivalent to quasi theories 3 a smooth principal g bundle over s 1 the morphisms in bibun s 1 g are bundle isomorphisms in definition 2 4 4 we define a loop space via bibundles definition 2 4 loop 1 x g let g be a lie group acting smoothly on a manifoldx the loop space loop 1 x g is defined to be the groupoidbibun s 1 x g only the g action on x is considered in loop 1 x g we add the rotations by adding more morphisms into loop 1 x g definition 2 5 loopext 1 x g the loop space loop ext 1 x g is defined to be the groupoid with the same objects as loop 1 x g each morphism consists of the pair t where t t is a rotation and is a morphism in loop 1 x g they make the diagram below commute s 1 t p oo f x s 1 p oo f in this paper we study the n th power of the functor loop 1 and loop ext 1 in definition 4 1 and 4 2 4 we show both of them can be defined for groupoids other than translation groupoids so loopn 1 and loop ext n 1 are both well defined definition 2 6 loopn 1 and loop ext n 1 the n th power loop n 1 is defined to be the composition of n bibun s 1 bibun s 1 bibun s 1 bibun s 1 the n th power loop ext n 1 is defined to be the composition of n loop ext 1 loopext 1 loop ext 1 loop ext 1 2 2 the n th power of the free loop functor before we introduce the orbifold loop space we study first the n th power ln of the free loop functor l for each g space x lnx is equipped with the action by aut tn and that by lng let g be a compact lie group recall the free loop space of any space x 2 1 lx c s 1 x it comes with the action by the circle group t when x is a g space it has the action by the loop group lg the n th power of the free loop functor 2 2 lnx c s 1 n x comes with an evident action by the torus group tn r z n defined by 2 3 t s 7 s t t tn lnx when x is a g space lnx is equipped with an action by lng 2 4 s 7 s s for any s s 1 n lnx lng combining the action by group of automorphisms aut s 1 n on the torus and the action by lng we get an action by the extended n th loop group ng on lx ng lng tn is a subgroup of 2 5 lng aut s 1 n s 7 s 1 s 4 zhen huan with tn identified with the group of rotations in aut s 1 n 6 aut s 1 n ng acts on lnx by 2 6 t 7 t t for any ng and lnx it s straightforward to check 2 6 is a well defined group action then we define the corresponding twisted loop group let gnf denote the set consisting of elements of the form 1 2 n where each i r n g is a continuous map satisfying i s 1 si 1 si 1 sn is a constant function when s 1 si 1 si 1 sn are fixed there is a group structure on gnf defined by 2 7 s 1 s 1 s n s n s the identity element is the with each i a constant map to the identity element of g for each gnf define the twisted loop group l g to be the group 2 8 r g s ei 1 i s s i s for i 1 n where ei 0 0 1 0 0 r n the multiplication of it is defined by 2 9 s s s for any l g and s r n the identity element e is the constant map sending r n to the identity element of g similar to ng we can define l g t n whose multiplication is defined by 2 10 t t s 7 s s t t t in the case when each i r n g in is a constant map the set of constant maps r n g in l g is a subgroup of it i e the intersection of the centralizers n i 1 cg i 2 3 orbifold loop space in this section we discuss another model of loop space let g be a compact lie group and x be a g space recall in definition 2 8 4 we defined the groupoid loop 2 x g definition 2 7 loop 2 x g let loop 2 x g denote the groupoid whose objects are 1 with 1 g and r x a continuous map such that s 1 s 1 for any s r a morphism 1 1 is a continuous map r g satisfying s s s the n th power of the loop functor loopn 2 is well defined because the def inition of loop 2 can be extended to any groupoid we describe it explicitly in the example below example 2 8 loopn 2 x g the n th power loop n 2 x g is the groupoid with objects where 1 2 n g n f and r n x is a continuous map such that s 1 si 1 sn s 1 si sn i s 1 sn for each i 1 2 n and s 1 s 2 sn r a morphism is a continuous map rn g satisfying s s s quasi theories 5 we also recall the extended loop space loopext 2 x g defined in definition 2 9 4 definition 2 9 loopext 2 x g let loop ext 2 x g denote the groupoid with the same objects as loop 2 x g a morphism consists of the pair t with r g a continuous map and t r a rotation on s 1 satisfying s s t s t we describe the n th power of the functor loopext 2 explicitly in example 2 10 example 2 10 loop ext n 2 x g the groupoid loop ext n 2 x g has the same objects as loopn 2 x g a morphism consists of the pair t with rn g a continuous map and t rn a rotation on s 1 n satisfying s s t s t we formulate a skeleton for loop ext n 2 x g below the objects of loop ext n 2 x g can be identified with the space gn f l x where l x l nx s ei s i s for each i 1 n and s r n the groupoid l x l g is a full subgroupoid of loop n 2 x g then we study the morphisms in loopextn 2 x g the group l g t n is isomorphic to 2 11 l g r n 1 e 1 2 e 2 n en l g t n acts on l x by 2 12 t s 7 s t s t for any t l g t n and l x the action by i on l x coincides with that by ei r n by similar discussion to proposition 2 11 4 we have the skeleton of loopn 2 x g and that of loop ext n 2 x g introduced below proposition 2 11 i the groupoid l x l g is a skeleton of loopn 2 x g where the coproduct goes over conjugacy classes in 0 g n f ii the groupoid l x g l x l g t n is a skeleton of loop ext n 2 x g where the coproduct goes over conjugacy classes in 0 g n f 6 zhen huan via a simple case with n 2 we start the discussion on the relation between loop ext n 1 x g and loop ext n 2 x g example 2 12 loop ext 2 1 x g by the definition of loop ext 2 1 x g an ob ject in loop ext n 1 x g consists of loop ext 1 x g principal bundle p which is de termined by a morphism in loopext 1 x g and a loop ext 1 x g map f p loopext 1 x g 0 which is determined by a section r loop ext 1 x g 0 with t 1 t 1 since f is continuous its image is contained in a single component of loopext 1 x g 0 i e the subspace consisting of those elements s 1 al p ar x with al the principal g bundle corresponding to a fixed element g g thus can be viewed as a continuous map r 2 x satisfying t 1 1 t 2 t 1 t 2 t 2 and t 1 t 2 1 t 1 t 2 t 1 for some r loop ext 1 x g 1 by the discusion above and example 2 10 we can formulate a fully faithful functor from loop ext 2 1 x g to loop ext 2 2 x g by induction we have the conclusion below lemma 2 13 the groupoid loop ext n 1 x g is isomorphic to a full subgroupoid of loop ext n 2 x g then we consider a subgroupoid of loop ext n 2 x g which is also a sub groupoid of loop ext n 1 x g let g tors denote the set of torsion elements in g let gnt denote the subset 1 n g n f each i is contant with image in g tors i j is the identity element in g of gnf definition 2 14 n x g let n x g denote the groupoid with the objects gnt x and with morphisms the space gnt g x below is a little explanation the space x is the intersection n i 1 x i each element x x can be viewed as a constant loop in l x i e the image of the loop consists of the single point x let cg denote the set g g ig g i for each i 1 2 n let g denote the quotient of cg rn under the equivalence x t 1 ti tn ix t 1 ti 1 tn x i t 1 ti 1 tn for each i for x x a t g 2 13 x a t x x a x quasi theories 7 remark 2 15 note that the functor n defined on global quotients is indeed the n th power of the functor the functor is defined in def inition 2 14 4 from which quasi elliptic cohomology is constructed as shown in definition 4 4 4 can be defined for any orbifold groupoid so n is well defined 3 the quasi theory qe n g in this section we define the quasi theories let g be a compact lie group and n denote a positive integer let gtorsconj denote a set of representatives of g conjugacy classes in gtors let gnz denote set 1 2 n i g tors conj i j is the identity element in g let 1 2 n g n z define cg cg 3 1 g cg r n 1 e 1 2 e 2 n en g 3 2 let q t u 1 denote the representation t 7 e 2 it let qi 1 q 1 tn u 1 denote the tensor product with q at the i th position and trivial representations at other position the representation ring r tn r t n z q 1 q n we have the exact sequence 3 3 1 cg g tn 0 where the first map is g 7 g 0 and the second map is g t 1 tn e 2 it 1 e 2 itn then the map r tn r g equips the representation ring r g the structure as an r tn module we have a generalization of lemma 3 1 4 presenting the relation between rcg and r g lemma 3 1 r tn r g exhibits r g as a free r t n module there is an r tn basis of r g given by irreducible representations v such that restriction v 7 v cg to cg defines a bijection between v and the set of irreducible representations of cg proof the proof of lemma 3 1 is analogous to that of lemma 3 1 4 i sketch it below via each cg representation cg gl m c with representa tion space v and irreducible representations i r gl m c of r i 1 2 n such that i acts on v via the scalar multiplication by i 1 we get an m dimensional g representation c 1 n with representa tion space v let li denote the order of the element i and i 1 e 2 iki li for some ki z since each i is 1 dimensional for any t r i t e 2 i ki li mi t for some integer mi we have 3 4 c 1 n g t 1 tn g 1 t 1 n tn in the other direction given an irreducible g representation with repre sentation spacew its restriction to each factor gives an irreduciblecg representation 8 zhen huan with underlying space v and an irreducible representation of rn thus irre ducible representations i i of r they satisfy i i 1 i it is straightforward to check the conclusion is true definition 3 2 for equivariant cohomology theories e h h and anyg space x the corresponding quasi theory qe n g x is defined to be gn z e g x remark 3 3 if there is an orbifold theory e orb satisfying e orb x g e g x for each g space x then definition 3 2 can be expressed as qe n g x e orb n x g where the groupoid x g is defined in definition 2 14 example 3 4 motivating example tate k theory and quasi elliptic cohomol ogy tate k theory is the generalized elliptic cohomology associated to the tate curve its divisible group is gm q z in 4 we introduce quasi elliptic cohomol ogy qell g it is exactly the theory qk 1 g in definition 3 2 we have the relation 3 5 qell g x z q z q k tate g x example 3 5 generalized tate k theory and generalized quasi elliptic coho mology in section 2 1 ganter gave an interpretation of g equivariant tate k theory for finite groups g by the loop space of a global quotient orbifold apply the loop construction n times we can get the n th generalized tate k theory the divisible group associated to it is gm q z n with quasi theories we can get a neat expression of it consider the quasi theory qk n g x gnz k g x qk n g x z q n z q n is isomorphic to the n th generalized tate k theory the theories qk n g has all the properties and features that we cited in section 4 4 properties in this section we present some properties of the quasi theories since each homomorphism g h induces a well defined homomorphism g h for each in g n z we can get the proposition below directly proposition 4 1 if e g g have restriction maps then each homomor phism g h induces a ring map qe n h x qe n g x characterized by the commutative diagrams quasi theories 9 4 1 qe n h x qe n g x y y e h x e g x for any gnz so qe g is functorial in g next we show if e g g has the change of group isomorphism then so does qe n g g let h be a closed subgroup of g and x a h space let h g denote the inclusion homomorphism the change of group map gh qe n g g h x qe n h x is defined as the composite 4 2 qe n g g h x qe n h g h x i qe n h

defined in 4 2 is an isomorphism proof the proof is analogous to that of proposition 3 19 4 i sketch it below for any hnz there exists a unique g n z such that g g 1 for some g g consider the maps 4 3 g h x a t x 7 a x g h x u x 7 g 1 u x g h x the first map is g equivariant and the second is equivariant with respect to the homomorphism cg g g sending u t 7 g ug 1 t taking a coproduct over all the elements hnz that are conjugate to g n z in g we get an isomorphism g h x g h x which is g equivariant with respect to cg then we have the map 4 4 gn z gn z e g g h x gn z e g g h x it s straightforward to check the change of group map coincide with the com posite qe n g g h x gn z e g g h x hn z e h x qe n h x with the second map the change of group isomorphism in e n g 10 zhen huan next we show that the theories qk n g have ku nneth map let g and h be two compact lie groups x is a g space and y is a h space let gnz and h n z let g tn h denote the fibered product of the morphisms g tn h it is isomorphic to g h under the correspondence t t 7 t consider the map below t k g x k h y k g h x y res k g tn h x y k g h x y where the first map is the ku nneth map of equivariant k theory the second is the restriction map and the third is the isomorphism induced by the group isomorphism g h g tn h for gnz let 1 denote the trivial line bundle over x and let qi denote the line bundle 1 qi over x the map t above sends both 1 qi and qi 1 to qi so we get the well defined map 4 5 k g x z q n k h y k g h x y definition 4 3 the tensor product of the quasi theory qk n g g is de fined by 4 6 qk n g x z q nqk n h y gnz hnz k g x z q n k h y the direct product of the maps defined in 4 5 gives a ring homomorphism qk n g x z q nqk n h y qk n g h x y which is the ku nneth map of the quasi theory qk n g g in addition as quasi elliptic cohomology the quasi theories qk n g g in herits the properties from equivariant k theories the proof of them are similar to that of proposition 3 17 proposition 3 18 in 4 by lemma 3 1 we have qk n g pt z q nqk n h pt qk n g h pt proposition 4 4 let x be a g h space with trivial h action and let pt be the single point space with trivial h action then we have qk n g h x qk n g x z q nqk n h pt especially if g acts trivially on x we have qk g x qk n e x z q nqk n g pt here e is the trivial group proposition 4 5 if g acts freely on x qell g x qell e x g remark 4 6 if the equivariant cohomology theories e g g have those good properties as equivariant k theories then they share corresponding properties as quasi elliptic cohomology theory
