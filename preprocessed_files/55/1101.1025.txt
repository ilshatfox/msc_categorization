study functors f cf d where c and d are simplicial model categories and cf is the category consisting of objects that factor a fixed morphism f a b in c we define the analogs of eilenberg and mac lane s cross effect functors in this context and identify explicit adjoint pairs of functors whose associated cotriples are the diagonals of the cross effects with this we generalize the cotriple taylor tower construction of 12 from the setting of functors from pointed categories to abelian categories to that of functors from cf to s a suitable category of spectra to produce a tower of functors n 1 f nf n 1 f f b whose nth term is a degree n functor we compare this tower to goodwillie s tower pn 1 f pnf pn 1 f f b of n excisive approximations to f found in 9 when f is a functor that commutes with realizations the towers agree more generally for functors that do not commute with realizations we show that the terms of the towers agree when evaluated at the initial object of cf 1 introduction tom goodwillie s calculus of homotopy functors is a technique for study ing homotopy functors of spaces and spectra 8 9 it provides a means by which a homotopy functor can be approximated by an n excisive functor in a manner analogous to the degree n taylor polynomial approximation of a real valued function because of this analogy the sequence of approximating functors p 1 f p 2 f pnf associated to a functor f by goodwillie s method is referred to as the taylor tower of f in the decades since its initial development goodwillie s theory has been further developed and applied by many other mathematicians in an effort to apply the calculus of functors to a more algebraic setting and to better understand the combinatorics underlying goodwillie s con structions the second and third authors of this paper developed a model for a taylor tower for functors of abelian categories based on a particular collection of cotriples arising from eilenberg and mac lane s cross effect functors 12 for a functor f the terms in the resulting sequence of ap proximations nf behave in a slightly different way than the n excisive approximations provided by goodwillie goodwillie s functors pnf satisfy a higher order excision property while the polynomial functors nf satisfy 1 http arxiv org abs 1101 1025 v 3 2 k bauer b johnson and r mccarthy a kind of higher additivity property the cotriple model for calculus has the advantage that the difference between a homotopy functor f and its polyno mial approximation nf can be modeled by cotriple homology which is well understood furthermore in good situations the cotriple method recovers information about goodwillie s functors in particular if c is the category of based topological spaces and f c c is a homotopy functor taking val ues in connected spaces that commutes with geometric realization andrew mauer oats generalized the cotriple method and showed that pnf nf 15 16 the cotriple method as established in 12 is limited it only applies to functors f c d where c is a pointed category a category with an object that is both initial and final with finite coproducts and d is an abelian category the generalization of the cotriple method to the topological setting in 15 and 16 is similarly limited as it applies to functors of based spaces on the other hand goodwillie s construction can be used for functors whose source categories are not pointed and whose target categories are not abelian in particular functors from the category top of unbased topological spaces or top y of topological spaces over a fixed space y to categories of spaces or spectra in 12 the essential cotriples are obtained by identifying adjoint pairs of functors for which the right adjoint is a cross effect functor goodwillie 9 identifies a similar adjunction up to homotopy in the topological setting of not necessarily basepointed spaces and spectra working with basepointed spaces mauer oats 15 shows directly that diagonals of cross effect func tors form the cotriples in which we are interested but does not identify the adjoint pairs from which these cotriples arise this suggests that there should be some adjoint pairs of functors that generate the cotriples in the topological setting at least when the objects are basepointed a key result in the present paper is to show that this is true for fairly general model cat egories even in the unpointed case as an application of the cotriples that one obtains from these strict adjoint pairs we generalize the construction of the taylor tower in 12 and obtain analogous results including a variation of mauer oats result that relates the terms in the cotriple taylor tower to those of goodwillie s we summarize the main results of the paper below we work with functors f cf d where c and d are simplicial model categories and cf is the category that consists of objects a x b factoring a fixed morphism f a b in c in 12 we used an adjoint pair involving the nth cross effect functor to define a cotriple n on the category of functors from a pointed category with finite coproducts to an abelian category the cotriple n yielded the n 1 st term in our taylor tower the main difficulty in reconstructing the cotriple n in the category of functors from cf to d is that the pair of functors used in 12 is no longer an adjoint pair but instead only gives us an adjunction up to homotopy we resolve this issue by factoring through a category of coalgebras associated to a certain cotriple t to obtain a pair of adjunctions whose composition cross effects and calculus in an unbased setting 3 produces the adjunction we need this gives us the following result the functor n is the diagonal of the nth cross effect theorem 3 8 theorem 3 14 theorem 3 17 for each n 1 there is a cotriple t on the category of functors of n variables from cf to d and an adjoint pair of functors u t between this category and the category of t coalgebras where the forgetful functor u is the left adjoint there is a second adjoint pair of functors n between the category of functors of n variables from cf to d and the category of functors of a single variable from cf to d with the diagonal functor as the left adjoint the composition yields the adjoint pair u t n whose associated cotriple is n defined on the category of functors from cf to d we can use the cotriples of theorem 3 17 as the basis for constructing terms in a taylor tower for f cf s where s is a suitable category of spectra however the nth term in this tower nf is not an n excisive functor as goodwillie constructs but instead a degree n functor a functor is degree n if its n 1 st cross effect vanishes whereas a functor is n excisive if it takes strongly cocartesian n 1 cubical diagrams of objects i e diagrams whose square faces are all homotopy pushouts to homotopy pullback diagrams we compare the notions of n excisive and degree n proving that being degree n is a weaker condition that can yield n excisive behavior in certain circumstances when f commutes with realizations we prove that the notions of degree n and n excisive coincide and that the functors pnf and nf agree in particular we have the following results proposition 4 11 if f cf s commutes with realizations then f is degree n if and only if f is n excisive we use proposition 4 11 to obtain a mauer oats style result showing that there is a fibration sequence of functors involving pnf and 1 n 1 f the simplicial object associated to the cotriple n 1 and functor f theorem 6 5 let f cf s be a functor that commutes with realizations then there is a co fibration sequence of functors 1 n 1 f f pnf as a consequence of theorem 6 5 we obtain corollary 6 8 let f cf s be a functor that commutes with real izations then pnf and nf are weakly equivalent as functors from cf to s when f does not commute with realizations the role of the initial object a in cf becomes more critical in comparing the notions of degree n and 4 k bauer b johnson and r mccarthy n excisive and in comparing nf and pnf we say that a functor is n excisive relative to a if it behaves like an n excisive functor on strongly cocartesian n 1 cubical diagrams whose initial objects are a and prove proposition 4 3 let f be a functor from cf to s let n 1 be an integer the functor f is degree n if and only if f is n excisive relative to a we also prove that the results of theorem 6 5 and corollary 6 8 apply when the functors are evaluated at a in particular we have theorem 6 9 let f cf s where cf is the category of objects factoring the morphism f a b then nf a pnf a an important realization is that theorem 6 9 can be rephrased to show that for any x the nth term of goodwillie s tower can be recovered from the nth term in some cotriple taylor tower even though the towers do not agree as functors to do so we change our focus to the category of objects over a fixed terminal object b this focus on the terminal object is exactly the same as the setting in 9 let c b be the category of objects in c over b and let f be a functor from c b to spectra given any x b in c b we have a weak equivalence of spectra pnf x nf x where nf is the cotriple taylor tower obtained by restricting f to the category c a key step in proving theorem 6 9 is the observation below the functor tnf is the first stage in the sequence of functors that goodwillie uses to construct pnf lemma 6 10 let f cf s then n 1 f a f a tnf a is a fibration sequence in s as an appendix we include a generalization of this result due to rosona eldred proposition b 1 for a functor f cf s skk 1 n 1 f a f a t k 1 n f a is a homotopy fiber sequence where skk denotes the k skeleton of the simplicial object 1 n 1 f the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we take care of preliminar ies we define the types of categories in which we will be working describe the models for and properties of homotopy limits and colimits that we use and review some basic notions associated to n cubical diagrams of objects in our categories in section 3 we define cross effects for functors from cf to d we also identify the composition of adjoint pairs that yields n as a cotriple in section 4 notions of degree n and n excisive are compared cross effects and calculus in an unbased setting 5 via the intermediate concept of n excisive relative to a in section 5 the cotriple taylor tower is defined and various properties are verified for it this leads to a comparison in section 6 of the cotriple taylor tower in this context with goodwillie s tower acknowledgments the authors

thoughtful review the referee s comments and corrections improved this paper substantially in particular the referee identified a critical error in an earlier version of section 3 and his her suggestion that we prove t is a cotriple directly and use the category of t coalgebras was crucial in resolving this problem 2 prerequisites in this section we describe the context in which we will be working and review some essential concepts that will be used throughout this paper the section is divided into three parts the first describes the categories with which we work and provides a summary of some properties of model categories simplicial model categories and categories of simplicial objects that we need the second covers necessary facts about homotopy limits and colimits the third discusses n cubical diagrams 2 1 the setting we work with functors from c to d where c and d are suitable model categories by suitable we mean that c and d should be simplicial model categories that c has a functorial cofibrant replacement functor and that d has a functorial fibrant replacement functor for many results we will also require that d but not c be pointed i e that it has an object that is both initial and final recall that a model category comes equipped with distinguished classes of morphisms weak equivalences cofi brations and fibrations satisfying the standard axioms as found on pp 1 1 1 2 of 17 or in several expository accounts such as definition 1 3 of 7 requiring that a category d be a simplicial model category gives us the following extra structure for every simplicial set k and object x of d there is an object x k in d and 6 k bauer b johnson and r mccarthy for every simplicial set k and object y of d there is an exponential object y k in d defined by the adjunction formula homd x k y homd x y k for each pair of objects x and y there is a simplicial set of mor phisms in d homd x y satisfying an additional axiom see pp 1 1 1 2 and 2 2 of 17 for much of this paper we focus on subcategories of c determined by mor phisms in c in particular for a morphism f a b in c the category cf is the category whose objects are pairs of morphisms in c of the form a x b that provide a factorization of f a b we will usually denote objects of cf simply by the object x through which f factors a morphism in cf is a commuting diagram x g a y b which we will denote as g x y when the context is clear the category cf has initial object a a b the first map is the identity and the second map is f and terminal object a b b the first map is f and the second map is the identity the category cf inherits structure from c more specifically it is a sim plicial model category whenever c is 17 ii 2 proposition 6 the map g in cf is a weak equivalence if the underlying map g x y is a weak equivalence in c a cofibration in cf if the underlying map in c is a cofi bration and a fibration if g is a fibration in c for convenience we assume from the outset that all objects of cf in this paper are cofibrant that is we assume that an object x of cf is a factorization a x b of f where the map a b is a cofibration in c since we assume all objects are cofibrant we abuse notation and simply denote the category of cofibrant objects by cf limits and colimits in cf are also inherited from c i e they can be computed in the underlying category c we will occasionally pass to the category scf of simplicial objects in cf when doing so we extend the model category structure of cf to scf using the reedy model structure recall that to do so one uses a quillen pair the following definition dates to 17 and can be found in many modern references e g 7 definition 2 1 let c and d be model categories and f c d goo be an adjoint pair of functors with f c d the left adjoint then f and g are called a quillen pair or quillen functor if f preserves cofibrations and weak equivalences between cofibrant ob jects and cross effects and calculus in an unbased setting 7 g preserves fibrations and weak equivalences between fibrant objects we would like to produce an adjoint pair of functors between cf and scf which becomes a quillen pair when we put the correct model structure on scf the left adjoint of the potential quillen pair is the geometric realization functor recall that is the category whose objects are ordered sets n 0 1 2 n for n 0 and morphisms are order preserving set maps for m 0 the standard m simplex is m hom m if c and hence cf is a simplicial model category and x is a simplicial object over cf then the object m xn is well defined for each m n 0 the geometric realization of x in scf denoted x is the coequalizer of m n m xn n n xn where the first coproduct runs over all possible morphisms from m to n in and the two arrows correspond to evaluation on m and xn respectively its right adjoint is the singular simplicial set functor the singular simplicial set of an object y is the simplicial object y defined by y n y n with face and degeneracy maps induced by the ones in placing the reedy model category structure on scf guarantees that the geometric realization and the singular simplicial set functors are a quillen pair the cofibrations and fibrations for this structure can be readily de scribed via latching and matching objects the nth latching object consists of the degenerate simplices in the degree n part of a simplicial object if x scf then lnx skn 1 x n colim n m xm where the colimit is taken over all surjections from n in note that the degeneracy maps of x provide a natural map lnx xn the nth matching object is defined similarly mnx lim m n xm where the limit is now taken over injections there is a natural map xn mnx that comes from the face maps of x the next theorem describes the reedy structure and establishes that it gives us the desired model category structure theorem 2 2 18 there is a model category structure on scf where a morphism g x y is a weak equivalence if xn yn is a weak equivalence in cf for all n 0 a cofibration if the natural morphism xn lnx lny colim xn lnx lny yn is a cofibration in cf for all n 0 and 8 k bauer b johnson and r mccarthy a fibration if the natural morphism xn yn mny mnx lim mnx mny yn is a fibration in cf for all n 0 with this model category structure the geometric realization and the singular simplicial set functors form a quillen pair 2 2 homotopy limits and colimits we use homotopy limits and col imits to describe certain desirable properties of our functors homotopy limits and colimits can be defined abstractly as total derived functors or depending on the category concretely in terms of specific models there are several models for homotopy limits and colimits typically involving a simplicial construction coming from the nerve of the underlying diagram category i we describe the two particular models that we use in this paper and the properties of these models that we will need for more details we refer readers to 19 which provides a good expository account of homotopy limits and colimits in model categories 8 which establishes many of the properties we use for topological spaces and spectra 10 for more details about the model we use for homotopy limit or 1 the classical reference the homotopy colimit model is that of 19 whereas the homotopy limit model is essentially the one described in 1 8 and 10 to construct homotopy colimits we use the generalized bar construction of 19 let x i cf be a functor then hocolimi x b i x where the right hand side is the geometric realization of the simplicial object b i x with bn i x i 0 in x i 0 the coproduct is indexed by the n simplices of n i the nerve of i and the face and degeneracy maps are given by those in n i the following properties of b i x are used in section 4 lemma 2 3 if x is objectwise cofibrant then 1 b i x is cofibrant under the reedy model structure on s cf 2 for any full subcategory i of i the induced map b i x b i x is a cofibration in the reedy model structure 3 if n i n i n i then b i i x b i x b i x b i x is a pushout diagram cross effects and calculus in an unbased setting 9 proof the first statement 1 is lemma 9 2 of 19 to prove 2 we must show that the map j bn i x lnb i x lnb i x bn i x is a cofibration in cf note that lnb i x is the coproduct i 0 in x i 0 indexed by chains of maps i 0 in in i for which some ik ik 1 is the identity map the structure maps lnb i x bn i x and bn i x bn i x are induced by inclusion maps the first is the inclusion of the degenerate elements while the second is induced by the forgetful functor from i to i these inclusions mean that the map j is constructed from maps that are cofibrations that is each summand x i 0 in bn i x lnb i x lnb i x is indexed by a chain of maps i 0 in either in i which is a sub category of i or else in i itself coming from a degenerate chain of maps in i or both thus x i 0 also represents a summand of bn i x to complete the construction of j we take the coproduct of identity maps one for each summand x i 0 of bn i x lnb i x lnb i x together with the coproduct over the initial object a of maps a x i 0 for each sum mand x i 0 of bn i x indexed by a chain of maps i 0 in which is neither degenerate nor contained in the subcategory i since x i 0 is cofibrant each of the maps a x i 0 is a cofibration and the identity map is always a cofibration the coproduct of cofibrations is again a cofibration so it follows that j is a cofibration for 3 let f i 0 be a simplex of b i x indexed by i 0 in since i 0 in is a simplex of n i the hypothesis implies that i 0 in is a chain of morphisms in either i or i thus the simplex f i 0 came from one in b i x or b i x hence the diagram of 3 is a pushout convention given a simplicial model category m the simplicial real ization from the category of simplicial objects in m to m preserves weak equivalences between cofibrant simplicial objects ifm has functorial cofi brant replacements then one can define hocolim op as a weak equivalence preserving functor from simplicial objects inm tom by composing the cofi brant replacement with a model for hocolim such as the one in 10 18 1 2 the functor hocolim op is sometimes called the fat realization and writ ten x hocolim opx there is a natural transformation x x which is a weak equivalence when x is a cofibrant simplicial object in m 10 k bauer b johnson and r mccarthy we will be using the fat realization throughout we will follow the conven tion which is a slight abuse of notation and simply write x for the fat realization as was done in 16 we note that by lemma 2 3 1 when x is objectwise cofibrant we can apply the fat realization to the diagram in 3 and obtain a cocartesian diagram the model for homotopy colimits described above can be dualized to produce a model for homotopy limits instead we construct homotopy limits in the following fashion definition 2 4 let i be a small category and f i c be an i diagram in c for each object i in our indexing category i let i i denote the category of elements in i over i this category has objects j i and morphisms given by commuting triangles let n i i be the nerve of the category i i then 1 holimi f hom i n i f where for a functor g from i to s set simplicial sets and a functor h i c the construction homi g h is the equalizer of the two obvious maps i i h i g i i j h j g i we make use of the following properties of homotopy limits the first four are essential for the key results in section 3 we include their proofs in appendix a the last property follows easily from the definition of homotopy limit above lemma 2 5 let i and j be small categories 1 if f i j c then holimi j f holimi holimj f 2 if j i and f i c then there is a morphism holimi f holimj f 3 if t is a constant i diagram with t c t and t f idt where t is a terminal object of c then holimi t t 4 if i is the trivial diagram on i then for any i diagram x holimi x x i 5 if f g i c and f g is a natural transformation also called a map of i diagrams then induces a map from holimi f holimi g as noted on page 379 of 10 the definition of homotopy limit above is homotopy invariant only when the diagram is objectwise fibrant when the i diagram f is objectwise fibrant holimi f is fibrant by corollary 18 5 2 2 cross effects and calculus in an unbased setting 11 of 10 for this reason we will use functors that take values in fibrant objects the first property of lemma 2 5 is often referred to by the slogan homo topy limits commute since it also implies that holimi holimj holimj holimi a special case of this property tells us that homotopy fibers and homotopy limits commute where homotopy fibers are defined as follows definition 2 6 let d be a pointed model category with initial final object and let g x y be a morphism in d then the homotopy fiber of g denoted hofiber g is the homotopy limit of x g y note that in this paper all homotopy fibers are computed in the target category d 2 3 cubical diagrams later in this paper we examine two fundamental concepts degree n and n excisive each of which is used to define a notion of degree n polynomial functor both concepts are determined by the behavior of a functor when applied to certain types of diagrams in cf definition 2 7 let n 1 2 n and let p n be the power set of n treated as a category whose objects are the subsets of n and morphisms are the set inclusions an n cubical diagram or n cube in a category d is a functor from p n to d one can picture an n cubical diagram as being shaped like a cube of dimension n for this reason we say that the object s c for any fixed s n is a vertex of the n cube similarly the image of the inclusion s s i 1 i n i s under is called an edge and for i j s the image of s s i s j s i j under is a 2 face to a functor of n variables from cf we associate two special n cubical diagrams example 2 8 in the category cf every object x is equipped with a map x to the terminal object b let h c nf d be a functor of n variables from cf to an arbitrary category d for an n tuple of objects x x 1 xn in cf the n cube h x b in d is defined by hxb s h x 1 b s x n b s 12 k bauer b johnson and r mccarthy where xib s xi if i s b if i s the image of the inclusion map s t under hxb is induced by the maps xi we will make use of an n cube of this type obtained by using the functor n c nf cf with n x 1 xn x 1 a a xn in particular the 2 cube 2 x y b is the square diagram x a y b a y x a b b a b we will also make use of an n cubical diagram that exploits the fact that every object in cf is equipped with a map from a recall that we assume that the map a x is a cofibration example 2 9 for an object x in cf let x a x denote the cofibration from the initial object to x let h c nf d be a functor of n variables from cf to an arbitrary category d then for an n tuple of objects x x 1 xn in cf the n cube h a x p n d is defined by ha x s h xa 1 s x a n s where xai s a if i s xi if i s the image of the inclusion map s t under ha x is induced by the maps xi again the functor n produces useful examples the 2 cube 2 a x y is the square diagram a a a a a y x a a x a y since a aa a a a y y and x aa x the diagram is the diagram which defines the coproduct in cf in particular it is homotopy cocartesian as defined below cross effects and calculus in an unbased setting 13 more generally we are interested in n cubes that are pullbacks or pushouts up to homotopy in particular we use the notions of homotopy cartesian and cocartesian diagrams introduced in 8 to define these terms we let p 0 n be the full subcategory of p n determined by the non empty subsets of n and p 1 n be the full subcategory of p n determined by the subsets other than n itself definition 2 10 let be an n cubical diagram in a model category d there are natural maps from the initial vertex to holims p 0 n s and hocolims p 1 n s to the terminal vertex n determined by the compositions lim holimp n holimp 0 n and hocolimp 1 n hocolimp n colimp n n respectively we say that is homotopy cartesian if the map from the initial vertex to holims p 0 n s is a weak equivalence we say that is homotopy cocartesian if the map from hocolims p 1 n s to the terminal vertex n is a weak equiva lence we say that is strongly homotopy cocartesian if each of its 2 faces is homotopy cocartesian following 8 we generally omit the term homotopy when speaking of these types of diagrams 3 cross effects the cross effects for functors of abelian categories were introduced by eilenberg and mac lane in 5 given a functor f between two abelian categories and a positive integer n eilenberg and mac lane defined a functor of n variables crnf that measures in some sense the extent to which f fails to be additive drawing on their ideas the second and third authors of this paper used the cross effects to define the degree of a functor and construct degree n polynomial approximations to functors from a pointed category to an abelian category in 12 the construction of the polynomial approximations depended on showing that the cross effect functors were parts of adjoint pairs and as such could be used to produce cotriples and cotriple resolutions that readily yielded the desired approximations in the present work we extend these ideas to functors whose domain category is not pointed and whose target is not necessarily abelian while some of the results of 12 carry through to this new context quite easily others do not in particular identifying the adjoint pair that yields the desired cotriple requires a different approach we use this section to adapt cross effects and the notion of the degree of a functor to a setting where the 14 k bauer b johnson and r mccarthy domain is of the form cf that we introduced in section 2 1 we also identify adjoint pairs and cotriples associated to cross effects that we need throughout this section we work with functors from the category cf to the target category d where cf and d are both simplicial model categories as described in section 2 1 in our constructions we need to use the fact that the target category but not the domain category is pointed thus we assume that d is pointed and denote the initial final object by to ensure that our homotopy limit constructions behave nicely with respect to weak equivalences we further assume that all functors take fibrant values in d the cross effect functors will be functors of functors for this reason we will often need to consider the category of functors from one category to another strictly speaking we can not do so since these categories rarely have sets of morphisms which are defined by natural transformations in practice this can often be resolved the functors from c to d will form a category if c is skeletally small or if we are careful to fix a suitable universe of sets in which to work as in 9 for the remainder of this paper we assume that we are in a situation in which such categories of functors make sense we use fun cf d to denote the category of functors from cf to d that preserve weak equivalences and fun c n f d to denote the category of functors of n variables from cf to d that preserve weak equivalences 3 1 iterated fibers and cross effects our first step is to define cross effects for our context the definition of the nth cross effect functor involves the iterated fibers of n cubical diagrams associated with the n fold coproduct functor n to better understand the definition consider a commuting square of objects in d 2 a b c d if we take homotopy fibers vertically we obtain a map of homotopy fibers hofiber a c hofiber b d we can take the homotopy fiber of this map to obtain an object x in d that we call the iterated fiber of the diagram x hofiber hofiber a c hofiber b d cross effects and calculus in an unbased setting 15 recall that the homotopy fiber of a map such as a c is defined to be the homotopy limit of the diagram a c using this we see that x is the homotopy limit of holim a c oo holim b d oo using properties 1 and 3 of lemma 2 5 we see that x is the homotopy limit of 3 a b oo c d oo oo oo oo oo this is also isomorphic to hofiber hofiber a b hofiber c d and as a consequence we see that hofiber hofiber a b hofiber c d hofiber hofiber a c hofiber b d in other words the order of the directions in which we take fibers does not matter when defining the iterated fiber of x we generalize this to define the iterated fiber of an n cube to do so we define a new diagram associated to an n cubical diagram definition 3 1 let x be an n cubical diagram in d the associated p 0 2 n diagram x assigns to the n tuple of sets s 1 sn in p 0 2 the object x s 1 sn if si 2 for at least one i x i si 1 2 otherwise 16 k bauer b johnson and r mccarthy x takes a morphism of sets in p 0 2 n s 1 sn t 1 tn to the map x defined as follows x x i si 1 2 j tj 1 2 si tj 6 2 1 i j n x s 1 s 2 sn tj 2 for some j x t 1 tn si 2 for some i where the second and third maps are uniquely determined by the fact that is the initial final object in d we note that if x is the diagram in 2 then x is the diagram in 3 definition 3 2 let x be an n cubical diagram in d the iterated homo topy fiber of x denoted ifiberx is given by ifiberx holim p 0 2 n x as demonstrated in the case of a 2 cube one can think of the iterated fiber of an n cube as the object constructed by first taking fibers in one direction u u i in the n cube then taking fibers of the resulting fibers in another direction and continuing until one has exhausted all independent directions in the cube as an immediate consequence we have the following lemma 3 3 let x be an n cube and let x 1 and x 2 be n 1 cubes with x x 1 x 2 then ifiberx hofiber ifiber x 1 ifiber x 2 we use iterated fibers to define the nth cross effect of a functor definition 3 4 let f cf d be a functor the nth cross effect of f is the functor of n variables crnf c n f d that for an n tuple x x 1 x 2 xn is the iterated fiber of the n cube f n xb that results from applying the functor f to the n cubical diagram n xb as defined in example 2 8 when we precompose crn with the diagonal functor x 7 x x x the result is a functor from cf to d we use n to denote this composition that is n f x crnf x x x when cf is pointed and d is abelian these definitions agree with those of 12 example 3 5 for n 2 cr 2 f x 1 x 2 is the iterated fiber of f x 1 a x 2 f b a x 2 f x 1 a b f b a b cross effects and calculus in an unbased setting 17 and 2 f x is the iterated fiber of f x a x f b a x f x a b f b a b as discussed at the beginning of this section the cross effect functors play an essential role in the construction of taylor towers in 12 when c is a pointed category and a is an abelian category it is straightforward to show that crn is an adjoint pair of functors here denotes precomposition with the diagonal functor as a consequence n crn is a cotriple this was used to construct the n 1 st term in the taylor tower of a functor f in trying to replicate this process for functors from cf tod one encounters an obstruction almost immediately the functors and crn no longer form a strict adjoint pair goodwillie has shown that they form an adjoint pair up to weak equivalence in a topological setting 9 but something more is need to show that n is a cotriple our solution is to recognize that n arises naturally from a pair of adjunctions the first involves the functor t defined as follows definition 3 6 for a functor h c nf d the functor th c n f d is defined for an n tuple x x 1 x 2 xn of objects in cf by th x 1 xn ifiber h x b remark 3 7 note that for h n the n fold coproduct functor a functor f cf d and an n tuple x 1 xn of objects in cf crnf x 1 xn t f n x 1 xn in the next two subsections we show that t is a cotriple on fun c nf d and identify an associated adjunction the other adjoint pair involves n and the diagonal functor 3 2 t is a cotriple recall that a cotriple on a category a consists of a functor a a together with natural transformations ida and such that the following diagrams commute oo our first goal is to prove the following theorem 3 8 there are natural transformations t id fun c n f d and t tt such that t is a cotriple on fun c nf d 18 k bauer b johnson and r mccarthy to prove this theorem we begin by defining the natural transformations t id fun c n f d and t tt both of these natural transformations will be determined by applying property 2 of lemma 2 5 to maps of the indexing sets used in the homotopy inverse limits that define th and tth we begin with definition 3 9 let h c nf d and x x 1 xn be an object in c nf consider the inclusion g 1 1 1 p 0 2 n by properties 2 and 4 of lemma 2 5 this induces a natural transformation holim p 0 2 n hxb holim 1 1 1 hxb g h x 1 xn which is natural in both h and x this gives us the natural transformation t id fun c n f d the definition of the second natural transformation requires understand ing the two fold iteration of t as the iterated fiber of a single cube note that there is an isomorphism p n p n p 2 n realized for example by sending s t p 1 2 n p n 1 2 n to s t given this we can treat 2 n cubes as p n p n diagrams lemma 3 10 let h c nf d and x x 1 x 2 xn be an object in c nf then tth x 1 x 2 xn is isomorphic to the iterated fiber of the p n p n diagram defined by s t p n p n 7 hxb s t proof by definition tth x 1 xn is the iterated fiber of the n cubical diagram s 7 th xb s but for each s n th xb s is itself the iterated fiber of the n cubical diagram t 7 h x s b t where x s x 1 s xn s is as defined in example 2 8 as ob served in the discussion preceding definition 3 1 homotopy fibers commute isomorphically in d from this we see that tth x is the iterated fiber of the p n p n diagram s t 7 h x s b t it is easy to check that h x s b t h x b s t and the result follows from this remark 3 11 in some instances it will be more convenient to treat the p n p n diagram s t p n p n 7 hxb s t of the previous lemma as the 2 n cube h xb given by u 2 n 7 h m 1 u m 2 u mn u cross effects and calculus in an unbased setting 19 where mi u xi if i n i u b if i n i u 6 definition 3 12 let p 0 2 2 n p 0 2 n be the map s 1 s 2 sn t 1 tn 7 v 1 v 2 vn where vi si ti if si ti 6 2 2 if si 2 or ti 2 by lemma 2 5 2 the set map p 0 2 2 n p 0 2 n induces a map 4 th x holim p 0 2 n hxb holim p 0 2 2 n hxb but it is straightforward to show that h xb hxb hence 4 gives us a natural transformation 5 h th tth with these definitions we prove theorem 3 8 proof we begin by showing that the diagram 6 t tt t tt t ttt commutes let h c nf d and x x 1 xn be an n tuple of objects in cf note that as is the case with tth x ttth x can be realized as the iterated fiber of a 3 n cube in particular ttth x is the iterated fiber of the 3 n cube that assigns to the set u 3 n the object h j 1 u jn u with ji u xi if i n i 2 n i u b otherwise hence ttth x can be treated as the holim of a p 0 2 3 n diagram from this point of view we see that 6 commutes by noting that the maps are induced by the commuting diagram of set maps p 0 2 n p 0 2 2 n oo p 0 2 2 n oo p 0 2 3 n id oo id oo 20 k bauer b johnson and r mccarthy to see that t t tt t oo t t commutes we note that t and t are induced at the indexing set level by the maps 1 p 0 2 n p 0 2 2 n 1 s 1 sn 7 s 1 sn 1 1 and 2 p 0 2 n p 0 2 2 n 2 s 1 sn 7 1 1 s 1 sn respectively it is straightforward to check that 1 and 2 are the identity map on p 0 2 n from this it follows that t and t are the identity on t 3 3 n is a cotriple to establish that n is a cotriple we describe an adjunction determined by the cotriple t categories equipped with cotriples have a related category of coalgebras related to the original category by a forgetful cofree adjunction definition 3 13 14 definition vi 2 dualized if is a cotriple on a category b then the category b of coalgebras is the category whose objects are pairs b where b ob b and b b which satisfy b and b idb a morphism f b b in b is a morphism f b b in b such that f f thus the category of t coalgebras fun c n f d t consists of functors g c n f d that are equipped with a section g tg to the natural transformation g tg g which also makes the diagram g tg t tg g ttg commute for example for any functor g fun c n f d there is an asso ciated t coalgebra tg g let t fun c n f d fun c n f d t be the free coalgebra functor which is defined on objects by t g tg g theorem 3 14 the functors fun c n f d t fun c n f d t u nn cross effects and calculus in an unbased setting 21 are an adjoint pair of functors with the forgetful functor u being the left adjoint proof the proof follows immediately from theorem 3 8 since t forms a cotriple the adjunction in question is the forgetful cofree adjunction which exists for any category of coalgebras over a cotriple the proof of this fact is formally dual to the proof of theorem vi 2 1 found in 14 for algebras over triples we now turn our attention to the second adjoint pair of functors that we use to establish that n is a cotriple definition 3 15 let fun c nf d fun cf d be the functor defined for a functor h c nf d by h x h x x let n fun cf d fun c n f d be the functor defined by precomposition with the functor n of examples 2 8 and 2 9 that is for a functor f n f x 1 xn f n x 1 xn f x 1 a a xn proposition 3 16 the functors and n are an adjoint pair of functors with being the left adjoint proof let h c nf d and f cf d we must prove that there are isomorphisms homfun cf d h f hom fun c n f d h nf nn we do so by taking advantage of some coproduct properties in cf the coproduct of x and y is the pushout of y a x which we denote x a y when x y the fact that x ax is a pushout means that we have a fold map x ax x that serves as a section to the inclusion x x ax into either term of the coproduct iterating this gives a fold map n x x that for each 1 k n is a section to k x nx inclusion into the kth term in the coproduct the map sends a natural transformation h f to the natural transformation n h i 1 in on the other hand a natural transformation h nf is sent to f 22 k bauer b johnson and r mccarthy to see that is equal to consider the diagram h x x h i 1 in h i x i x x h h x x x f i x f f x the bottom rectangle commutes by the naturality of and the top triangle commutes because is a section to each ik going along the bottom and left edges of the diagram gives while the right hand edge is just on the other hand the diagram h x 1 xn h i 1 in x 1 xn h i xi i xi xi xi f i xi nf i 1 in f i xi f f i xi commutes for the same reasons as the previous diagram and shows that recall that for an adjoint pair of functors f c d goo where g is the right adjoint the composition f g forms a cotriple on a see for example appendix a 6 of 21 since n is the composition of the left adjoint u with the right adjoint t n it forms part of a cotriple in particular the counit for the adjunction produced by the pair u t n yields a natural transformation n id and a natural transformation n n n is defined by u t n where is a unit for the adjunction this gives us the following theorem 3 17 the functor and natural transformations n n n n n id form a cotriple on the category of functors fun cf d cross effects and calculus in an unbased setting 23 3 4 weakly reduced and degree n functors we finish this section by introducing some properties of functors that are related to t and crn definition 3 18 a functor f fun c nf d is weakly n reduced provided that f x 1 xn whenever any xi b proposition 3 19 let h c n f d the functor th is a weakly n reduced functor proof we assume that xn b the argument in other cases is similar we describe hxb as a map of two n 1 cubes toph x b bottomh x b for s p n 1 tophxb s h x b s and bottomhxb s h x b s n consider the n 1 cube hxb obtained by taking the homotopy fiber of tophxb bottomh x b more explicitly for s p n 1 hxb s hofib toph x b s bottomh x b s using lemma 3 3 one can show that ifiber hxb ifiber hxb for each s p n 1 the map tophxb s bottomh x b s is the identity since xn b hence h x b s for each s and so the iterated homotopy fiber of hxb is equivalent to as a consequence the iterated homotopy fiber of hxb is as well corollary 3 20 for a functor f cf d crnf is weakly n reduced we use cross effects to define degree n functors definition 3 21 a functor f cf d is degree n if and only if for all n 1 tuples x of objects in cf crn 1 f x whenever a functor is degree n it is also degree m for any m n this is a consequence of the following lemma which says that higher cross effects can be obtained by iterating second cross effects the lemma implies in particular that if crnf then crn 1 f as well proposition 3 22 for a functor f cf d and objects x 1 xn xn 1 in cf crnf x 1 xn 1 can be treated as a functor of one variable by holding the first n 1 variables fixed the second cross effect of this functor is crn 1 specifically cr 2 crnf x 1 xn 1 xn xn 1 crn 1 f x 1 xn 1 24 k bauer b johnson and r mccarthy proof the proof makes repeated use of lemma 3 3 which allows us to rewrite the diagrams whose iterated fibers yield cr 2 crnf to obtain the n 1 cubical diagram defining crn 1 we begin by noting that cr 2 crnf x 1 xn 1 xn xn 1 is defined to be the iterated homotopy fiber of the diagram crnf x 1 xn 1 xn a xn 1 crnf x 1 xn 1 xn a b crnf x 1 xn 1 b a xn 1 crnf x 1 xn 1 b a b each corner of this square diagram is the iterated homotopy fiber of an n cube so by lemma 3 3 the iterated homotopy fiber of the diagram above can be written as the iterated homotopy fiber of the following 2 cube of n cubes 7 f n x b f n x 1 b f n x 2 b f n x 1 2 b where x x 1 xn 1 xn a xn 1 x 1 x 1 xn 1 xn a b x 2 x 1 xn 1 b a xn 1 x 1 2 x 1 xn 1 b a b as in the proof of proposition 3 19 we write each of the n cubes in 7 as a map of n 1 cubes by replacing an n cube with the map of n 1 cubes top bottom where for s p n 1 top s s bottom s s n by again applying lemma 3 3 we can view the iterated fiber of 7 as the homotopy fiber of the map from the iterated homotopy fiber of the 2 cube of n 1 cubes top topf n x b topf n x 1 b topf n x 2 b topf n x 1 2 b cross effects and calculus in an unbased setting 25 to the iterated homotopy fiber of bottom bottomf n x b bottomf n x 1 b bottomf n x 2 b bottomf n x 1 2 b all four n 1 cubes in bottom are the same so the iterated homotopy fiber of bottom is weakly equivalent to thus we can concentrate on determining the iterated homotopy fiber of top but this diagram can be rewritten as a single n 1 cube that is precisely the one whose iterated homotopy fiber is crn 1 f x 1 xn xn 1 4 degree n and n excisive functors in the next section we use the cotriple n 1 to construct a degree n approximation to a functor f in 9 goodwillie shows how to construct an n excisive approximation to a functor we use this section to compare these two types of functors showing that n excisive functors are always degree n and that degree n functors behave like n excisive functors on certain types of cubical diagrams the condition we call n excisive relative to a we conclude by proving that the two notions are equivalent when f is a functor that commutes with realization in this section we work with functors f cf s where cf is the category of maps factoring f a b and s is a suitable model of spectra such as in 6 or 11 we let be the initial final object in s as in previous sections we assume that f preserves weak homotopy equivalences and takes values in fibrant objects we also assume that s has functorial fibrant and cofibrant replacements we first review the definition of n excisive using the notions of cartesian and strongly cocartesian diagrams from definition 2 10 definition 4 1 8 a functor f is n excisive if and only if for every strongly cocartesian n 1 cube of objects in cf applying f yields a cartesian n 1 cube f for x x 1 xn 1 in c n 1 f the cube n 1 a x of example 2 9 is strongly homotopy cocartesian recalling that each a xi is assumed to be a cofibration in fact any strongly homotopy cocartesian cube with initial vertex a is weakly equivalent to one of this type by proposition 2 2 of 8 we prove that a degree n functor will take strongly cocartesian diagrams like these to cartesian diagrams definition 4 2 the functor f cf s is n excisive relative to a if and only if f n 1 a x is cartesian for every n 1 tuple of objects x in cf 26 k bauer b johnson and r mccarthy proposition 4 3 let f be a functor from cf to s let n 2 be an integer the functor f is degree n 1 if and only if f is n 1 excisive relative to a an integral part of the proof of this proposition will be the n cube of n cubes defined below definition 4 4 let x x 1 xn be an n tuple of objects in cf each of these objects is equipped with morphisms xi a xi and xi xi b whose composition is f we use x p n p n c n f to denote the n cube of n cubes that is defined as follows for s t p n p n x s t is the n tuple whose ith object is x s t i a if i s t xi if i s i t b if i t for any i t the map x s t x s t i is induced by the map f if i s and otherwise is induced by the map xi for i s the map x s t x s i t is induced by the map xi if i t and otherwise is the identity map the target category for our functor f is assumed to be stable some of the subsequent results in this section hold in a more general context but for our current applications using s as the target category suffices this enables us to make use of the following observations remark 4 5 an n cubical diagram in s is cocartesian if and only if it is cartesian in particular this implies that finite hocolimits and finite homo topy inverse limits commute remark 4 6 in s finite homotopy inverse limits commute with homotopy colimits of a countable filtered diagram thus combined with the remark above one sees that finite homotopy inverse limits commute with the homo topy colimits over op as these homotopy colimits can be written using the filtration by skeleta as a countable filtered homotopy colimit of finite homo topy colimits remark 4 7 let be an n cubical diagram the total homotopy fiber of denoted tfiber is the homotopy fiber of the map holim p 0 n for n cubes in s the iterated fiber and homotopy fiber of are weakly equivalent see section 1 of 8 for details the next lemma restates two propositions from 8 the lemma makes use of the fact that a map of two n cubes 1 2 is an n 1 cube cross effects and calculus in an unbased setting 27 lemma 4 8 8 1 6 1 7 for any map 1 2 of n cubes of objects in s the n cube 1 is cartesian if 2 is cartesian and the n 1 cube 1 2 is cartesian the n cube 2 is cartesian if 1 is cartesian and the n 1 cube 1 2 is cartesian the n 1 cube 1 2 is cartesian if the n cubes 1 and 2 are cartesian the proof of proposition 4 3 relies on analyzing x from several different perspectives we single out two of these perspectives in the next remark recall from definition 3 15 that n denotes precomposition with the n fold coproduct functor remark 4 9 let x be an n tuple of objects in cf and f cf s be a functor 1 fixing s p n yields an n cube nx s when s n this n cube is n xb and as such is precisely the type of n cube used to show that a functor is degree n 1 in other words f is degree n 1 if and only if the n cube nf x n is cartesian 2 fixing t p n yields another n cube nx t when t this n cube is n a x and as such is precisely the type of n cube used to show that a functor is n 1 excisive relative to a in other words f is n 1 excisive relative to a if and only if nf x is cartesian for example taking the first point of view when n 2 we have the 2 cube of 2 cubes nf x s t whose outer square is indexed by the s variable 28 k bauer b johnson and r mccarthy f a f b f b f b ab f f f f f x 2 f 1 f x 1 f 1 f x 2 f b ax 2 f b f b ab f x 2 f f f x 1 f 1 f x 1 f b f x 1 ab f b ab f x 1 f f f x 1 f 1 f x 1 ax 2 f b ax 2 f x 1 ab f b ab f x 1 f x 2 taking the second point of view yields the 2 cube of 2 cubes 2 f x s t whose outer square is indexed by the t variable f a f x 1 f x 2 f x 1 ax 2 f x 1 f x 2 f f f x 2 f f f x 1 f b f x 1 ab f b f x 1 ab f 1 f x 1 f f f x 1 f b f b f b ax 2 f b ax 2 f 1 f x 2 f f f x f b ab f b ab f b ab f b ab f 1 f 1 the final step before proving proposition 4 3 is to prove the next lemma cross effects and calculus in an unbased setting 29 lemma 4 10 let x be an n tuple of objects in cf and f cf s be a functor if f is n 1 excisive relative to a then for each s n s 6 n the n cube nf x s is cartesian proof we prove this by induction on the size of s when s n x is the n cube n a b where b b b b since f is n 1 excisive relative to a we know that nf x is cartesian let k n and assume that nf x r is cartesian for all r n with r k let s n with s k to establish that nf x s is cartesian we will first show that the s cube of n cubes 8 n f x r t r s t n obtained by restricting x to p s p n is cartesian to do so we view this s cube of n cubes from a different perspective in particular as an s cube of s cubes of n s cubes fix r s and consider the s cube of n s cubes i e the n cube given by 9 n f x r r u where r varies over all subsets of s and u varies over all subsets of n s we claim that for each r this is a cartesian n cube when r this follows because 9 is f n a y where y is the n tuple whose jth entry is y j xj if j s b if j s and f is n 1 excisive relative to a now suppose that r 6 and i r in this case we can view 9 as a map of s 1 cubes of n s cubes 10 n f x r r u nf x r i r u where r s i and u n s vary by definition the map in 10 is the identity for each choice of r and u applying lemma 4 8 we see that the s cube of n s cubes in 9 is cartesian as a result the s cube of n cubes obtained by letting r in 9 vary over all subsets of s is exactly 8 since 9 is cartesian for each choice of r lemma 4 8 tells us that 8 is cartesian finally by assumption we know that nf x r is a cartesian n cube for each r 6 s hence the fact that 8 is cartesian coupled with lemma 4 8 again yields the fact that nf x s must be a cartesian n cube as well with this we prove proposition 4 3 proof we begin by considering nf x from the point of view of remark 4 9 2 let t n t 6 and i t we can view nf x t 30 k bauer b johnson and r mccarthy as a map of two n 1 cubes 11 n f x v t nf x v i t where v s i however by definition these two n 1 cubes are identical and the map between them is the identity hence nf x t is cartesian for each t n t 6 now assume that f is degree n 1 by remark 4 9 2 it suffices to show that nf x is cartesian to conclude that f is n 1 excisive relative to a viewing the cube as in remark 4 9 1 we see that for any s n x s is the n cube n z s b where z s is the n tuple whose ith entry is z s i xi if i s a if i s since f is degree n 1 it follows that nf x s is cartesian then by lemma 4 8 nf x is cartesian since nf x t is cartesian for each t 6 lemma 4 8 guarantees that nf x must be as well assuming that f is n excisive relative to a by remark 4 9 1 we need to show that nf x n is cartesian to conclude that f is degree n 1 by lemma 4 10 we know that nf x s is cartesian for each s n s 6 n hence by lemma 4 8 it suffices to show that nf x is cartesian we do so by applying lemma 4 8 after making sure that nf x t is cartesian for each t n this has been done for t 6 above when t x t is n a x and so nf x t is cartesian by assumption one can extend a functor f cf s to the category of simplicial objects scf in two ways by applying f degreewise to a simplicial object x to obtain a simplicial object f x in s or by applying f to the geometric realization x recall our convention that all realizations are fat when these two approaches agree i e when the natural map f x f x is a weak equivalence for each simplicial object x we say that f commutes with realizations in particular by remark 4 6 in s finite homotopy limits commute with realizations proposition 4 11 if f cf s commutes with realizations and preserves weak equivalences then f is degree n if and only if f is n excisive proof by proposition 4 3 we know that an n excisive functor is always degree n so we need only show that if f is degree n then f is n excisive the strategy for the proof is to show that any strongly cocartesian n 1 cube x can be replaced by an equivalent n 1 cube b x built using the generalized bar construction as defined in section 2 2 we are then able to show that f b x is cartesian by applying lemma 4 8 levelwise to a map of n 1 cubes f b 1 x f b x we illustrate the case n 1 first with the proof of n 1 to follow cross effects and calculus in an unbased setting 31 let 12 x y z w be a cocartesian square let b x y and b x z be the generalized bar constructions whose realizations yield hocolim x y and hocolim x z respectively since hocolim x y y we know that b x y y similarly b x z z and b x x where b x is the gener alized bar construction coming from the trivial diagram x by the first two parts of lemma 2 3 b x b x y b x z is a cofibrant replacement of the diagram x y z and hence we can take the strict pushout of this diagram in order to compute the homotopy colimit w but by lemma 2 3 3 this strict pushout is pre cisely the bar construction whose realization yields hocolim y x z we use b y x z to denote this generalized bar construction since f preserves weak equivalences we may replace our original diagram 12 with 13 b x b x y b x z b y x z looking levelwise we see that in degree k the diagram is x y a x a ax z ax a ax y ax a a x a z where the coproducts in the upper right and lower left corners contain k 1 copies of x and that in the bottom right corner has 2 k 1 1 copies of x after applying the degree 1 functor f to 13 we would like to show that f b x y z b f x f y f z 32 k bauer b johnson and r mccarthy where f represents the cofibrant replacement of f this is easily done in the degree 1 case because proposition 4 3 guarantees that whenever f is degree 1 the diagram f a f x 1 f x 2 f x 1 a x 2 obtained by applying f to a cocartesian square must be cartesian since f takes values in s the square is also cocartesian and so f x 1 a x 2 f x 1 f a f x 2 however this approach cannot be generalized to functors of degree n 1 so instead we will describe the proof for degree 1 with an eye towards the general case at each simplicial level we want to expand 13 into the cube 14 a b 1 k x y pp pp pp pp pp pp x bk x y b 1 k x z b 1 k y x z pp pp pp pp pp pp bk x z bk y x z where bk x y bk x z and bk y x z are the kth levels of the sim plicial sets described above and b 1 k x y respectively b 1 k x z and b 1 k y x z is the object of cf obtained from bk x y respectively bk x z and bk x y z by removing the copy of x corresponding to the constant sequence x x the map b 1 k x y bk x y is then given by the natural inclusion respectively b 1 k x z bk x z and b 1 k y x z bk y x z we make no claim that b 1 x y is a simplicial object each square face of this cube is easily seen to be a strict pushout so the cube is strongly cocartesian as we determined in section 3 4 the fact that f is degree 1 implies that it is also degree 2 then by proposition 4 3 we know that applying f to 14 yields a cartesian diagram cross effects and calculus in an unbased setting 33 the back face of 14 a b 1 k x y b 1 k x z b 1 k y x z is a pushout diagram with initial vertex a and since f is degree 1 proposi tion 4 3 tells us that this square will be a cartesian square after f is applied recognizing that f takes values in s and applying lemma 4 8 we can con clude that f bk x f bk y f bk x z f bk y x z is also a pushout square we have now calculated that the diagram f b x f y f b x y f b x z f z f b y x z is a pushout diagram levelwise and hence is a pushout diagram of simplicial sets as a result f b y x z hocolim f b x y f b x f b x z however since f commutes with realizations and hocolim commutes with realizations the right hand side of this equivalence is equivalent to the ho motopy pushout of f y f x f z to complete the proof we note that by remark 4 5 it suffices to show that applying f to 12 yields a cocartesian square since f commutes with realization we have f hocolim z x y f b y x z f b y x z hocolim f z f x f y which concludes the proof in the case n 1 to prove the result for n 1 we let x p n cf be a strongly cocartesian n cube for s p n let ds be the restriction of p n to the collection of sets s s s let b x s be the generalized bar construction computing hocolimds in simplicial level k bk x s 0 k ds x 0 where all coproducts are taken over x we claim that the n cube x is weakly equivalent to the n cube b x one can verify this by using the 34 k bauer b johnson and r mccarthy fact that x is strongly cocartesian and applying lemma 2 3 3 in particular if s s are subsets of n then b x s s b x s b x s b x s s is a pushout diagram now for each k we consider the n 1 cube b 1 k x bk x where b 1 k x s is obtained from bk x s by removing the copy of x corresponding to the constant sequence for each 6 s n and b 1 k x a there are natural inclusion maps b 1 k x s bk x s given by the inclusion a x indexed by the sequence the n cube b 1 k x s is again strongly cocartesian for any s s i in p n the diagram b 1 k x s b 1 k x s i bk x s bk x s i is easily seen to be a pushout diagram since it can be rewritten as b 1 k x s b 1 k x s i b 1 k x s ax b 1 k x s i ax thus the n 1 cube b 1 k x s bk x s and the n cube b 1 k x s are strongly cocartesian cubes with initial vertex a and any degree n 1 functor f will take these to cartesian cubes by proposition 4 3 the remainder of the proof now proceeds exactly as in the case n 1 5 a taylor tower from cotriples having established that n is a cotriple for n 1 we show in this section how to define the cotriple taylor tower for a functor from cf to s where cf and s are as described in the beginnings of sections 3 and 4 the results in this section are generalizations to cf and s of results in section 2 of 12 in the next section of this paper we compare this cotriple taylor tower to goodwillie s taylor tower of n excisive approximations to define the terms in our taylor tower we use the augmented simplicial objects associated to the cotriples n definition 5 1 let f be a functor from cf to s and n 1 we use 1 n f to denote the simplicial object constructed from f using the cotriple cross effects and calculus in an unbased setting 35 n more specifically 1 n f is the simplicial object that in simplicial degree k is k 1 n f with face and degeneracy maps defined by si i k i kn f k 1 n f di i k i kn f k 1 n remark 5 2 we note that 1 n is augmented over idfun cf s by hence yields a natural simplicial map from 1 n to the simplicial object id 1 associated to the identity cotriple idfun cf s id id built out of the identity functor definition 5 3 let f be a functor from cf to s and n 0 the nth term in the cotriple taylor tower of f is the functor nf hocofiber 1 n 1 f f recall our convention that realizations are fat where the map 1 n 1 f f is the composition of the map induced by with the weak equivalence id 1 f f and hocofiber denotes the homotopy cofiber given by hocofiber a b hocolim a b we use nf to denote the natural transformation f nf in the resulting cofibration sequence 1 n 1 f f nf convention even when f takes fibrant values nf may not since s has functorial fibrant replacements we can replace nf by a fibrant valued weakly equivalent functor nf in which case we actually obtain a natural diagram f nf nf oo we will abuse notation and continue to write this as f nf and assume without loss of generality that our nf takes fibrant values using properties of adjoint pairs one can show that nf is a degree n approximation to f proposition 5 4 for a functor f cf s the functor nf is degree n the analogous statement for functors to abelian categories in 12 lemma 2 11 was proved by establishing that n 1 1 n 1 f n 1 f has a sim plicial homotopy inverse and hence n 1 nf is contractible in the abelian setting this was enough to conclude that for any collection of ob jects x 1 xn 1 in the domain category crn 1 nf x 1 xn 1 is contractible since it is a direct summand of n 1 nf xi xi in 36 k bauer b johnson and r mccarthy the present paper this last step is not an option however one can modify the homotopies used in the abelian case to prove directly that crn 1 1 n 1 f crn 1 f is a homotopy equivalence we adapt this approach for use in this paper the proof makes use of the following general facts about adjoint pairs of functors lemma 5 5 let l r a b be a pair of adjoint functors where l a b is the left adjoint let lr b b be the associated cotriple and b be an object in b then there are natural simplicial maps f r id 1 b r 1 b and r 1 b r id 1 b such that f is naturally homotopic to the identity on r 1 b and f is naturally homotopic to the identity on r id 1 b proof let ida rl be the unit of the adjunction and lr idb be the counit of the adjunction one can use and to construct the simplicial maps f r id 1 b r 1 b and r 1 b r id 1 b and simplicial homotopies between f and f and the appropriate identity maps in particular in degree k k r k and fk r lr k fk 1 with f 0 r one can construct the homotopies in a similar fashion to that of exercise 8 3 7 of 21 using r in place of the extra degeneracy 0 with this we prove proposition 5 4 proof applying the above to the adjoint pair u t n 1 of the previous section we see that t n 1 1 n 1 f is weakly equivalent to t n 1 f via the augmentation t n 1 setting cr n 1 f t n 1 f this becomes cr n 1 1 n 1 f cr n 1 id 1 f applying the forgetful functor from fun c n 1 f s t to fun c n 1 f s this functor forgets the coalgebra structure gives us an equivalence between crn 1 f and crn 1 n 1 f the fact that crn 1 as a finite homotopy limit commutes with finite and filtered homotopy colimits implies that crn 1 nf crn 1 hocofiber 1 n 1 f id 1 f hocofiber crn 1 1 n 1 f crn 1 id 1 f hence nf is degree n we consider the functor nf to be an approximation to f in the fol lowing sense proposition 5 6 1 if f is degree n then the natural transformation nf f nf is a weak equivalence 2 the pair nf nf is universal up to weak equivalence among degree n functors with natural transformations from f cross effects and calculus in an unbased setting 37 the proofs of these results are similar to those of proposition 1 18 in 9 and lemma 2 11 in 12 and are omitted we end this section by defining natural transformations nf n 1 f that allow us to assemble the nf s into a taylor tower for f definition 5 7 let x be an object in cf we define the n 1 cube of n tuples x p n c n f as follows for i 6 1 and s n 1 the ith entry in x s is x s i x if 2 i 1 s b otherwise and for i 1 we have x s 1 x a x if 1 2 s b a b otherwise the morphisms are all induced by the morphism x b recalling the definition of n 1 x x x b from example 2 8 it is easy to verify that there is a natural map of n 1 cubes n n 1 x x x b nx applying a functor f and taking the total fiber of the resulting n 1 cubes yields a natural map n n 1 f x tfiberf nx but by construction letting x denote the restriction of x to s n 1 with 2 s we see that tfiberf nx hofiber tfiberf nx tfiberf nx 2 hofiber tfiberf nx tfiberf nx and we have a natural map n tfiberf nx tfiberf nx applying the fold map y a y y with y equal to x or b to the first pair of terms in the coproducts produces a natural map of n cubes that yields n tfiberf nx n f x we define n n 1 f x n f x to be the natural composition n n n n this gives us a map of simplicial objects n 1 f n f that can be used to construct the natural transformation qnf nf n 1 f with this map we obtain the desired taylor tower 38 k bauer b johnson and r mccarthy theorem 5 8 there is a natural tower of functors f n 1 zz n n 1 n 1 f qn 1 nf qn n 1 f 1 f 0 f 6 a comparison to goodwillie s n excisive approximation we use this section to compare the degree n approximation nf of a functor f cf s to goodwillie s n excisive approximation pnf after reviewing the definition of pnf we first show that when f commutes with realizations pnf and nf are weakly equivalent as functors from cf to s when f does not commute with realizations we also obtain agreement of the functors nf and pnf but only when evaluated at the initial object of cf we conclude the section by using this fact to show that for an object x the degree n and n excisive approximations to f at x agree but only after restricting the constructions in a sense to be made clear later to c x b throughout this section c and d are used to denote simplicial model categories and s is a suitable model of spectra as in section 4 as in previous sections for a morphism f a b in c we use cf to denote the category of objects of c that factor f and we use to denote the initial final object in s while the proofs of the two main theorems of the section require that our functors take values in s some of the lemmas used to prove them are stated and proved more generally for functors from c to d 6 1 goodwillie s n excisive approximations to define the n excisive approximation to a functor f we make use of the following construction for objects x in cf definition 6 1 for a finite set u of cardinality u let du be the poset obtained from p u by restricting to the empty set and one element subsets of u that is the set of objects of du is t t u for an object x in cf with x b we define a functor xu du cf by xu s x if s b if s 6 and xu t we define b x to be the functor from finite sets to cf that for the finite set u is given by b x u hocolim s du xu s remark 6 2 suppose that u has u elements 1 if we assume that x b is a cofibration then b x u is the coproduct over x of u copies of b in particular if u is the empty set then b x u x and if u has a single element then b x u b cross effects and calculus in an unbased setting 39 2 let uy be the category of unbased spaces over a fixed space y used by goodwillie the initial and final objects are and y respectively when x is an object in uy the space y x u is equivalent to the fibrewise join of x with u over y denoted x y u that goodwillie uses to define pnf recall that x y u is defined as hocolim x x u y u one can see that y xu and x y u are equivalent either by directly comparing the homotopy colimits used to define them or by noting that both constructions yield u copies of the mapping cone of x y identified together along a single copy of x to define pnf x for a functor of uy and object x in uy goodwillie defines an intermediate functor tnf by tnf x holim u p 0 n 1 f x y u there is a natural map f x f x y tnf x and iterating yields a sequence f x tnf x t 2 nf x t 3 nf x the functor pnf is defined as the homotopy colimit of this sequence pnf x hocolimkt k nf x see section 1 of 9 for more details in light of remark 6 2 2 we extend goodwillie s definition of pnf to functors from cf to d as follows definition 6 3 let f cf d and let x be an object in cf with canonical map x b let tnf x be defined by tnf x holim u p 0 n 1 f b x u then pnf x is given by pnf x hocolimk t k nf x n kuhn has also defined pnf for functors of pointed simplicial or topologi cal model categories 13 as an immediate consequence of definition 6 3 we have the next lemma lemma 6 4 for f a functor from cf to s the construction pn satisfies the following properties 1 let fi i i be a finite diagram of functors from cf to s then holim i i pnfi pn holim i i fi as functors from cf to s 40 k bauer b johnson and r mccarthy 2 let g be a simplicial object in the category of functors from cf to s then pn g png where pn is applied levelwise to g 3 cofibration sequences of functors from cf to s are preserved by pn 4 for f cf d there is natural transformation f pnf when f is n excisive this is a weak equivalence proof the first part of the lemma follows from the definition of pn and the facts that homotopy limits commute and filtered countable homotopy colimits commute with finite homotopy limits in s to see that the second part is true note that the fact that homotopy colimits commute tells us that for an object x in cf png x hocolimkt k ng x hocolimk t k ng x so it remains to show that t kng x t k n g x where by definition t kn g x is the finite homotopy limit of a diagram of spectra in general homotopy limits do not commute with fat realizations but in this case we have a finite homotopy limit in s the third part is proved using similar arguments the natural transformation of the fourth part is the transformation from f the initial object of the sequence defining pnf into the homotopy colimit of that sequence to understand what happens when f is n excisive note that for an object x the n 1 cube u p n 1 7 b x u is a strongly cocartesian diagram applying f yields a cartesian diagram and so we have an equivalence f b x holim u p 0 n 1 f b x u but this is simply f x tnf x the result follows 6 2 functors that commute with realizations given a functor f cf s we seek to show that pnf and nf agree as functors of cf when f commutes with realizations this is achieved via the next theorem theorem 6 5 let f cf s be a functor that commutes with realizations then there is a co fibration sequence of functors 1 n 1 f f pnf proof consider the cofibration sequence used to define nf 1 n 1 f f nf cross effects and calculus in an unbased setting 41 applying pn to the cofibration sequence and using the natural transforma tion of lemma 6 4 4 gives us the commutative diagram below 15 1 n 1 f f nf pn 1 n 1 f pnf pn nf both rows of this diagram are cofibration sequences the first by definition and the second because pn preserves cofibrations consider the top row of the diagram by definition n 1 f x tfiber f n x x b since n 1 f is formed by a finite homotopy inverse limit and since f commutes with realizations and finite homotopy inverse limits in s commute with realizations n 1 f commutes with realizations as well as a result we see that each functor in the top row commutes with realizations in particular nf commutes with realizations and so by propositions 4 11 and 5 4 nf is n excisive by lemma 6 4 4 the rightmost map in 15 is an equivalence this tells us that the square 1 n 1 f f pn 1 n 1 f pnf is cocartesian to finish the proof we show pn 1 n 1 f the initial final object in s to do so note that lemma 6 4 2 gives us pn 1 n 1 f pn 1 n 1 f and so it is enough to show that pn 1 n 1 f by proving that pn n 1 f we do so in corollary 6 7 below to prove corollary 6 7 we use the following lemma which is lemma 3 1 of 9 in stating the lemma we use the notion of weakly n reduced functors and the functor from definitions 3 18 and 3 15 lemma 6 6 let g c nf d be a weakly n reduced functor then pn 1 g proof we prove this by first showing that the natural transformation from g to tn 1 g factors through to do so for an object x cf we consider the n cube g x u p n 7 g x u g x 1 u x 2 u xn u where xi u b x x if i u b x i b if i u 42 k bauer b johnson and r mccarthy we also consider the n cube t g x used to define tn 1 g x u p n 7 t g x u g b x u the inclusions i u and u induce a map of n cubes g x t g x moreover the map g x tn 1 g x factors as g x g x holim u p 0 n g x u holim u p 0 n t g x u tn 1 g x since g is weakly n reduced g x u for u 6 and so we see that g x tn 1 g x factors through in a similar fashion we can show that t kn 1 g x t k 1 n 1 g x factors through for all k and obtain the result noting that n 1 f crn 1 f where crn 1 f is a weakly n 1 reduced functor by corollary 3 20 we obtain the desired corollary corollary 6 7 for a functor f cf d pn n 1 f the following corollary is an immediate consequence of theorem 6 5 corollary 6 8 let f cf s be a functor that commutes with realiza tions then pnf and nf are weakly equivalent as functors from cf to s 6 3 functors that do not commute with realizations if f does not commute with realizations the functors pnf and nf no longer agree on all objects in cf but they still agree at the initial object a we establish this fact in the next theorem theorem 6 9 let f cf s where cf is the category of objects factoring the morphism f a b then nf a pnf a we prove this theorem in a manner similar to that of theorem 6 5 and its corollary in particular we use the commutative diagram 15 evaluated at a 16 1 n 1 f a f a nf a pn 1 n 1 f a pnf a pn nf a in this case we will use the following lemmas to prove that the right vertical map is an equivalence and that pn 1 n 1 f a the second lemma is a consequence of the key observation in the first lemma lemma 6 10 let f cf s then n 1 f a f a tnf a is a fibration sequence in s cross effects and calculus in an unbased setting 43 a generalization of this result for t knf a k 1 is the main result of appendix b proof recall our assumption that a f b is a cofibration because we are evaluating at the initial object in cf the coproducts used to define tnf a are taken over a as are the coproducts used in the n 1 cubical diagram whose total fiber defines n 1 f in particular n 1 f a is the total fiber of the n 1 cubical diagram that assigns the object f a 1 s an 1 s to the set s where ai s a if i s b if i s since the coproducts are taken over a letting s denote the cardinality of s we have a 1 s an s s times b a a b b a s then by remark 4 7 n 1 f a tfiber s p n 1 7 f a 1 s an 1 s tfiber s p n 1 7 f b a s hofiber f b a holim s p 0 n 1 7 f b a s hofiber f a tnf a as desired lemma 6 11 if f cf s is a degree n functor then f a pnf a is a weak equivalence proof since f is degree n crn 1 f thus n 1 f a and by lemma 6 10 f a tnf a moreover since tn and crn 1 are both homotopy inverse limit constructions and homotopy inverse limits commute crn 1 tnf tncrn 1 f hence tnf is also a degree n functor and by lemma 6 10 tnf a t 2 nf a continuing in this fashion we see that f a hocolimk t k nf a pnf a with this we prove theorem 6 9 proof we prove this theorem by proving that we have a fibration sequence of spectra 1 n 1 f a f a pnf a 44 k bauer b johnson and r mccarthy consider diagram 16 following the same strategy as in the proof of theo rem 6 5 we see that it suffices to show that the rightmost vertical arrow is an equivalence and that the object in the bottom left corner is equivalent to the first fact is a consequence of lemma 6 11 to prove the second fact we note that as was the case for theorem 6 5 pn 1 n 1 f pn 1 n 1 f since f takes values in s and so it is enough to show that pn n 1 f a this was done in corollary 6 7 the result follows the proof of theorem 6 9 relies on the critical observation in the proof of lemma 6 10 that in order to obtain agreement between n 1 f and the fiber of f tnf we must evaluate at the same object over which the coproducts for n 1 f are taken this suggests that for general f the cotriple construction can be used in place of goodwillie s construction only when evaluating at the initial object of the domain category in fact when evaluated at other objects nf and pnf can differ greatly example 6 12 consider the functor h 1 u s that takes a space x to the eilenberg mac lane spectrum associated to its first singular homology group by theorem 6 9 we know that 1 h 1 p 1 h 1 for an arbitrary space x one can show that 2 h 1 x and hence 1 h 1 x h 1 x however if x is a connected space then t 1 h 1 x holim h 1 x 1 h 1 x 1 2 h 1 x 2 since x 1 and x 2 are equivalent to the cone on x and x 1 2 is equivalent to the unreduced suspension of x as a result one sees that p 1 h 1 x when x is connected so 1 h 1 and p 1 h 1 are not equivalent as functors one can obtain similar results for higher homology groups this example shows that we cannot guarantee in general that nf and pnf agree as functors however we can show that the particular value pnf x is equivalent to the nth term in a cotriple taylor tower for f albeit not the same tower as used in theorem 6 9 to do so we change our focus from cf which has a fixed initial and fixed terminal object to the category c b of objects over b to state the result precisely we use the following notation an object of the category c b of objects over b is a morphism x b in c given a functor f c b s we can restrict it to the category c determined by objects that factor x b in c we use f to denote this restriction we can define the cross effects of f using x as our initial object and b as our final object we denote these cross effects and the associated cotriples by cr nf and n f respectively note that even if c b had an initial object a so that it is secretly a category cf for some fixed f a b cr nf is not the restriction of crnf to c for example for an cross effects and calculus in an unbased setting 45 object z in c cr 2 f z z is the total fiber of the diagram f z a z f z ab f b a z f b ab whereas cr 2 f z z is the total fiber of f z x z f z x b f b x z f b x b we use nf to denote the homotopy cofiber of n 1 1 f f as indicated above using the map in place of f to define our cross effects changes the construction nf to nf however this is not the case for pnf as its definition requires a specific initial object the empty set or the point in the base pointed case and prohibits restriction to the category c in light of this theorem 6 9 can be restated to obtain equivalences between nf x and pnf x moreover this equivalence is functorial in x theorem 6 13 let f c b s and let x b be an object in c b 1 there is a functor n f c b s taking x b to nf x 2 there is a natural weak equivalence nf x pnf x proof let x b and y b in c b the functoriality of n f comes from the fact that a map x y in c b induces enough maps between coproducts over x and y respectively to induce maps between n f x and n f y the rest follows from theorem 6 9 7 convergence of the cotriple tower this section identifies criteria that guarantee convergence of our tower our first goal is to show that our tower converges for analytic functors just as goodwillie s tower does in the second part of this section we also identify conditions on cross effects that guarantee convergence in this section we work with functors f whose target category s is a category of spectra since analyticity requires a notion of connectivity in both the domain and target categories we restrict ourselves to the setting of goodwillie s calculus of homotopy functors for the results concerning analyticity in particular we let t denote the category of topological spaces and tg denote the category 46 k bauer b johnson and r mccarthy determined by the morphism g c d for the results in the second part of this section we will work with functors f cf s where c is a simplicial model category and cf is determined by a fixed morphism f a b in c throughout this section we use p f to denote the homotopy inverse limit of the goodwillie tower for f and f to denote the homotopy inverse limit of the cotriple tower we say that the goodwillie tower for f converges at x if the natural map f x p f x is a weak equivalence convergence of the cotriple tower is defined analogously 7 1 analyticity and convergence as in 8 by a k connected map of spaces we mean a map whose homotopy fibers are all k 1 connected recall the following definitions from 8 definition 7 1 8 1 3 the n cubical diagram x in t or s is k cartesian provided that the map from x to holims p 0 n x s is k connected definition 7 2 8 4 1 a functor f t s is stably n excisive if the following is true for some numbers c and en c if x p n 1 cf is any strongly cocartesian n 1 cube such that for all s n 1 the map x x s is ks connected and ks then the diagram f x is c ks cartesian definition 7 3 8 4 2 a functor f t s is analytic if there is some number q such that f satisfies en n q 1 for all n 1 in 9 goodwillie showed that his tower for f converges at x when f is analytic and x d is at least 1 connected we establish a similar result for our tower below using the next lemma lemma 7 4 if f tg s is analytic and x d is at least 1 connected then kn 1 f x is at least q n 1 k 1 connected here q is the constant such that f satisfies en n q 1 proof since n 1 f x is the total fiber of a strongly cocartesian n 1 cube in tg k n 1 f x can be described as the total fiber of a strongly cocartesian n 1 k cube y for each s p n 1 k y s is a coproduct of copies of x and d over c and each morphism is a coproduct of copies of and identity morphisms in particular this ensures that y y s is at least 1 connected for each s n 1 k the analyticity condition then guarantees that the total fiber of f y is at least q n 1 k 1 connected the result follows proposition 7 5 if f tg s is analytic satisfying en n q 1 for each n and x b is at least 1 connected then f x nf x is at least q n 1 connected as a consequence f x f x proof by the lemma we know that in each simplicial degree 1 n 1 f x is at least q n 1 1 1 connected since homotopy colimits preserve cross effects and calculus in an unbased setting 47 connectivity it follows that the realization of 1 n 1 f x is at least q n 1 1 1 connected the result follows using the fact that in spectra 1 n 1 f x f x nf x is also a fibration sequence 7 2 cross effects and convergence mimicking the convergence results for the abelian case found in section 4 of 12 we can place conditions on n 1 f that guarantee convergence of the cotriple tower proposition 7 6 let f cf s be a functor that takes values in connec tive spectra let x be an object in cf suppose that there is a c 0 such that for 1 t c 1 tn 1 f x is at least c 1 t connected then nf f x nf x is c 1 connected proof the connectivity condition is sufficient to ensure that 1 n 1 f x is at least c connected to see this one can use the spectral sequence associated to the simplicial spectrum 1 n 1 f x that has e 1 p q p q 1 n 1 f x and converges to p q 1 n 1 f x see e g 4 for details the connec tivity condition guarantees that e 1 p q 0 for p q c hence 1 n 1 f x must be at least c connected the result follows again by using the fibration sequence 1 n 1 f x f x nf x the condition that tn 1 f x is at least c 1 t connected for 1 t c is like that of stable n excision in goodwillie s calculus in that the condition guarantees a certain connectivity of the map f x nf x we use this condition to guarantee convergence of our tower as follows definition 7 7 for a functor f cf s object x in cf and n 0 we set fcon x n max c z conn t n 1 f x c 1 t for 1 t c 1 with this the next proposition is an immediate consequence of proposi tion 7 6 proposition 7 8 let f cf spec be a functor that takes values in connective spectra if limn fcon x n n then f x f x is n 1 connected when n the cotriple tower converges for x 48 k bauer b johnson and r mccarthy appendix a proofs of homotopy limit properties in this appendix we address the four properties of homotopy inverse limits in lemma 2 5 that are essential to our proof in section 3 that t is a cotriple although these properties are widely accepted as being true we had difficulty finding proofs of them in the literature as they are critical to our work in section 3 we include their proofs in this appendix for c a category let homc a b be the set of morphisms between a b ob c recall that a simplicial model category also has a simplicial set of maps for objects a and b we use homc a b to denote this and note that homc a b n homc a n b let m be a simplicial model category and let c be a small category following hirschhorn h for x a c diagram in m and k a c diagram in simplicial sets define homc k x equalizer c c xc k c f c c c xc k c where k c is an object in ss the category of simplicial sets the above makes use of the fact that for m ob m and k ob ss there is an object mk inm when we let k n c the classifying space or nerve of the over category c see h 14 1 1 we define holimcx hom c n c x as noted on page 379 of h this model for holimcx is homotopy invari ant only when x is objectwise fibrant when x is objectwise fibrant by corollary 18 5 2 2 of h holimcx is a fibrant object ofm to establish the desired homotopy inverse limit properties we make use of the following important adjunction this adjunction is stated and proved for morphism sets in h but it is straightforward to generalize the proof to simplicial mapping spaces to obtain the version stated below proposition 18 3 10 2 of h let x be a c diagram in m k a c diagram of simplicial sets and let w be an object of m then there is a natural isomorphism homm w homc k x homssc k homm w x here ss is the category of simplicial sets and ssc is the category of c diagrams in simplicial sets with this adjunction and the yoneda lemma we can establish the desired properties for this model of holim in m by reducing them to properties of diagrams of simplicial sets in order to do this we first recall some facts about diagrams of simplicial sets cross effects and calculus in an unbased setting 49 by definition 18 2 3 1 and proposition 18 2 5 of h for a and b ele ments of ssc homssc a b consists of simplicial sets of the form n 7 natssc a n b that is the n simplices are simplicial maps from a c n to b c that are natural in c since the one point set is terminal we see that the constant c diagram to is terminal in ssc given a functor from d to c of small categories and objects a b in ssc we have a natural map homssc a b homssd a b by restricting f to c or f d f d the last property we want is a generalization of the exponential law found in gj proposition ii 5 1 to simplicial mapping spaces for diagrams of simplicial sets given x ob ssd and y ob ssc d there is an evaluation map in ssc d homssd x y x ev y given by sending f xn homssd x y x n to f xn idn using this we obtain the following proposition exponential law for objects k in ssc x in ssd and y in ssc d there is a natural isomorphism homssc k homssd x y ev homssc d k x y proof the function ev is defined by sending g k n homssd x y to the composite k x n k n x g 1 homssd x y x ev y this is an isomorphism whose inverse is the map defined by sending g k x n y to the map g k n homssd x y where g sends x km n m m i x k n to the composite x m 1 i x x k n k x n g y here x is as defined on p 6 of gj we now establish the four properties of our model for holimcx form that we need to prove t is a cotriple that is we prove the first four properties of lemma 2 5 property 1 given c and d small categories and x a c d diagram in m there are natural isomorphisms holimcholimdx holimc dx holimdholimcx 50 k bauer b johnson and r mccarthy proof recall that n c d n c n d as simplicial sets making repeated use of the two propositions we obtain the following sequences of isomorphisms of simplicial sets homm w holimc dx homm w hom c d n c d x homssc d n c d homm w x homssc d n c n d homm w x homssc n c homssd n d homm w x homssc n c homm w hom d n d x homm w hom c n c hom d n d x homm w holimcholimdx by the yoneda lemma we obtain the natural isomorphism property 2 if c d is a functor of small categories and x is a d diagram inm we obtain a natural map holimdx holimc x proof observe that there is a natural transformation of objects in ssc n c n d then homm w holimdx homssd n d homm w x homssc n d homm w x homssc n c homm w x homssc n c homm w x homm w hom c n c x homm w holimcx and so by yoneda we have our natural transformation property 3 if t is a constant c diagram in m with t c t and t f idt where t is a terminal object ofm then holimct t proof homm w holimct homssc n c homm w t this is because homm w t the constant one point c diagram of simplicial sets since t is terminal inm since w was arbitrary holimct is terminal and terminal objects are all isomorphic cross effects and calculus in an unbased setting 51 property 4 if i is the trivial category on i then for x any i diagram in m holimix x i proof this is proposition 18 3 7 2 of h appendix b by rosona eldred lemma 6 10 may be viewed as the base case of a more general phenom enon the purpose of this appendix is to explain how 1 n 1 f and the tower of functors tknf defining pnf are related by a sequence of fibration sequences we prove the following proposition proposition b 1 for a functor f cf s there is a homotopy fiber sequence skk 1 n 1 f a f a t k 1 n f a this gives an alternative approach to understanding theorem 6 9 since as k goes to infinity proposition b 1 suggests that there is a homotopy fiber sequence 1 n 1 f a f a pnf a i e the result of theorem 6 9 the proof of proposition b 1 is by induction taking lemma 6 10 as the base case with k 0 b 1 lemmas necessary for proof given a square of spectra a b c d we have an associated diagram which includes the fibers then let h 1 hofib c d h 4 hofib a c h 2 hofib a b h 5 hofib b d h 3 hofib h 4 h 5 h 6 hofib a d hofib h 2 h 1 lemma b 2 with the definitions given above the following is a cartesian square h 3 h 4 h 2 h 6 proof of lemma b 2 we can construct an associated diagram of fibers it is the leftmost in the homotopy fiber sequence shown in figure 1 since h 3 hofiber h 4 h 5 then h 3 h 4 h 5 is a homotopy fiber sequence this says that h 5 hofiber h 3 h 4 figure 2 illustrates that h 2 h 6 h 5 is also a homotopy fiber sequence as homotopy fiber taking commutes 52 k bauer b johnson and r mccarthy h 3 h 4 h 5 h 2 h 6 h 5 h 1 h 1 h 3 h 4 h 5 h 2 a b h 1 c d d d d d figure 1 homotopy fiber sequence of diagrams h 2 h 6 h 5 h 2 a b d d figure 2 h 2 h 6 h 5 is a homotopy fiber sequence thus h 5 h 2 h 6 is also a homotopy fiber sequence we can extend the square to the left with its homotopy fibers as in figure 3 as they are equivalent and we re in spectra which cures the basepoint troubles we can conclude that the square is a homotopy pullback h 5 h 3 h 4 h 5 h 2 h 6 figure 3 square and its fibers lemma b 3 skk 1 n 1 f hocolimpop 0 k 1 n 1 f proof of lemma b 3 let s be the cardinality of the set s from 20 we know the natural functor that maps p 0 n to n via s 7 s 1 is ho motopy left cofinal its dual which maps p 0 n op to op n is then homotopy right cofinal that is we have that hocolim op n x hocolimp 0 n op x given that sknx hocolim op n x with x 1 n 1 f we have the statement of our lemma cross effects and calculus in an unbased setting 53 lemma b 4 for f cf s skk 1 n 1 f hocolim skk 1 1 n 1 f skk 1 1 n 1 n 1 f n 1 f note that lemma b 4 is a simple application of the covering lemma for hocolim cubes given on p 299 of 8 as the dual situation to proposition 0 2 in the same paper to the k 1 cube that at u p k is k u n 1 f whose co punctured with the final element of the cube removed hocolim is equivalent to skk 1 n 1 f by lemma b 3 b 2 general case of induction assume that skk 1 1 n 1 f a f a tknf a is a homotopy fiber sequence then construct the diagram of homotopy fiber sequences in figure 4 skk 1 1 n 1 n 1 f a n 1 f a n 1 t k nf a skk 1 1 n 1 f a f a tknf a skk 1 1 n 1 tnf a tnf a t k 1 n f a figure 4 n 1 and iterated fiber diagram since homotopy limit constructions commute n 1 t k nf a t k n n 1 f a and the top line is also a homotopy fiber sequence application of lemma b 2 to the diagram of figure 4 lets us conclude that figure 5 is a cartesian square since we re in spectra we also know that it is cocartesian skk 1 1 n 1 n 1 f a n 1 f a skk 1 1 n 1 f a hofib f a tk 1 n f a figure 5 desired cartesian square for general k we now apply lemma b 4 to conclude that hofib f a tk 1 n f a skk 1 n 1 f a 54 k bauer b johnson and r mccarthy references 1 a bousfield and d kan homotopy limits completions and localizations lecture notes in mathematics 304 springer
