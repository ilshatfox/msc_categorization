real k theories in particular we show how a real projective bundle theorem implies an unexpected relation between atiyah s kr theory and the usual equivariant k theory of real vector bundles this relation has been used recently in a new computation of the witt group of real curves 10 section 4 we also interpret atiyah s theory as a special case of twisted k theory 1 short overview of classical topological k theory since the introduction of algebraic k theory by grothendieck 5 var ious versions of topological k theories have emerged essentially due to atiyah historically as a prototype of generalized cohomology theory atiyah and hirzebruch 2 introduced the k theory of topo logical complex vector bundles on a compact space x traditionnally written kux there is a real analog kox when a compact group g is acting continuously on x segal 12 defined the equivariant ver sionskug x andkog x by considering vector bundles onx with a group action compatible with the action on x we simply write kg x in a statement involving either kug x or kogx a more subtle theory was introduced by atiyah 4 one considers a space x with involution and complex vector bundles on x with an involutive antilinear action compatible with the involution on x atiyah denoted this theory by kr x and among other things he showed the interest of this theory in real operator theory and in real algebraic geometry this last point of view was illustrated in recent publications 10 11 finally there is a less known theory starting from vector bundles which are modules over an algebra bundle for instance the clifford bundle associated to a real vector bundle with a non degenerate quadratic form this is the starting idea for the definition of the so called twisted 1 http arxiv org abs 2010 04590 v 1 2 max karoubi universite paris 7 denis diderot k theory with many recent publications in mathematics and physics see e g 6 13 as shown some time ago in 7 the general framework for all these theories is the concept of banach category for such categories c one defines not only the usual grothendieck group k c but also derived functors k top i c in the same framework for any additive functor c c with an adequate continuity condition one also define relative groups k top i inserted in an exact sequence k top i 1 c k top i 1 c k top i k top i c k top i c for instance when c is the category of vector bundles on x and c the category of vector bundles on a closed subspace y the groups k top i are atiyah hirzebruch relative groups 1 k i x y the interest of these relative groups will appear in the next sections 2 the real projective bundle theorems let g be a compact group acting continuously on a compact space x and let v be an equivariant real vector bundle on x let w be an equivariant subbundle of v p v the real projective bundle on x associated to v and p w the projective subbundle of p v if t is any real vector bundle we denote by c t the clifford bundle asso ciated to t with a positive quadratic form i e a metric as another definition we denote by ec t x the category of vector bundles on x with an action of c t finally if a compact group g is acting on everything we denote by e c t g x the category of vector bundles with an intertwining action of c t and g theorem 2 1 the relative group k ig p v p w is isomorphic to the group ki 1 of the forgetful functor e c v 1 g x e c w 1 g x here the notation t r means in general the vector bundle t with a trivial bundle of rank r added remark 2 2 this theorem is not completely new for g trivial it has been proved in 7 corollaire 3 2 2 however the proof given there cannot be extended to the equivariant case which is important for the applications we have in mind see e g example 2 4 below 1 we use indifferently the notation ki or k i real k theories 3 before giving examples let us state a second theorem where the nota tion c t now means the clifford bundle of a vector bundle t with a negative non degenerate quadratic form i e the opposite of a met ric theorem 2 3 the relative group k ig p v 1 p w 1 is iso morphic to the group ki 1 of the forgetful functor e c v g x e c w g x example 2 4 let us consider the usual real k theory so that kg kog let g z 2 acts on x and on the trivial bundle v x r by antipode it is easy to see that the category e c v g x is equiva lent to the category of real bundles on x in the sense or atiyah 4 therefore the k group of this category is atiyah s group kr x on the other hand if we choose w 0 we have p v 1 p w 1 v x r so that the relative group kg p v 1 p w 1 is kog x r therefore theorem 2 3 implies the following exact se quence apparently unknown kr x kog x kog x r kr 1 x e a similar argument with the iterated suspension of x implies the more general exact sequence kr i x ko ig x ko i g x r kr i 1 x remark 2 5 a quite different and more involved proof of this exact sequence is given in 10 appendix c remark 2 6 a more concrete description of the group kog x r is to remark that it is isomorphic to the relative group kog x d 1 x s 0 therefore it sits in the middle of an exact sequence ko 1 g x ko 1 x kog x r kog x for instance if x y s 0 with a trivial action of g on y and the free action on s 0 z 2 we have kog x r ko 1 y kr x ku y and the exact sequence e is a reformulation of bott s exact sequence for the space y see e g 9 iii 5 18 ku y ko y ko 1 y ku 1 y example 2 7 let x be a point g the trivial group v rn w 0 in this situation the group k 1 of theorem 2 3 is inserted in an exact sequence involving k groups of clifford algebras 4 max karoubi universite paris 7 denis diderot k cn 0 k c 0 0 k 1 k 1 c n 0 0 in this exact sequence cp q denotes in general the clifford algebra of rp q with the quadratic form x 1 2 xp 2 xp 1 2 xp q 2 therefore theorem 2 3 implies that the reduced k theory of rp n is isomorphic to the cokernel of the map k cn 0 kc 0 0 a result due to adams 1 note that this result holds in real or complex k theory the clifford algebra being understood over the relevant field example 2 8 let us consider now the relative group kg p v 1 p v which is well known to be the k group kg v of the thom space of v according to theorem 2 1 it is isomorphic to the k 1 group of the forgetful functor e c v 2 g x e c v 1 g x using bott periodicity and the periodicity of clifford algebras it is not difficult to show that for r 0 this is also the kr group of the forgetful functor e c v r 1 g x e c v r g x which is a formulation of thom s isomorphism theorem in equivariant k theory 8 however we shall not detail this example any further since thom s isomorphism is needed to prove theorem 2 1 as we shall see in next section proof of theorem 2 3 assuming theorem 2 1 this part is purely algebraic according to theorem 2 1 which we assume the group kg p v 1 p w 1 is isomorphic to the k group of the forgetful functor e c v 2 g x e c w 2 g x note that c 2 m 2 k where the basic field k r or c and 2 being an abbreviated notation 2 for k 2 therefore for any real vector bundle t the clifford bundle algebra c t 2 is isomorphic to a 2 2 matrix algebra over c t that is c t 2 c t c 2 indeed we can define a map t 2 c t c 2 by the formula t v 7 t e 1 e 2 1 v e 1 and e 2 being the basis vectors of k 2 by the 2 and also for the trivial bundle of rank 2 real k theories 5 universal property of the clifford algebra this map induces an homo morphism c t 2 c t c 2 which is an isomorphism for dimension reasons morita s theorem implies then that the categories e c t 2 g t and e c v g t are naturally equivalent as a consequence the group kg p v 1 p w 1 is isomorphic to the k 1 group of the forgetful functor e c v g x e c w g x which is essentially the formulation of theorem 2 3 3 proof of theorem 2 1 the main ingredient to prove theorem 2 1 is thom s isomorphism the orem in equivariant k theory the complex analog is due to atiyah and states that for a complex g vector bundle v on a g space x the group kug v is isomorphic to kugx the general version is more subtle and is proved in 8 if v is a real g vector bundle on a g space x the group kg v is isomorphic to the grothendieck group of the forgetful functor e c v 1 g x e c v g x in particular if b v resp s v denotes the ball bundle resp the sphere bundle of v we have an exact sequence kg b v s v kg b v kg s v k 1 g b v s v where kg b v s v is identified with the k group of in order to prove theorem 2 1 for the simpler case w 0 we have to replace the group g by g z 2 the summand z 2 acting on v by antipode in that case we may identify the group kg z 2 s v with the group kg p v and the group kg z 2 b v kg z 2 x with the k group of the category e c 1 g x let us look more closely at the group kg z 2 b v s v which is the k group of the forgetful functor e c v 1 g z 2 x e c v g z 2 x e c v 1 g let represents the antipode acton of z 2 on v we use to un twist the action of g z 2 on c v 1 more precisely by multi plying with the top generator of c v 1 we show that the cate gory e c v 1 g z 2 x is isomorphic to the product category e c v g z 2 x e c v g z 2 x that is e c v 1 g x e c v 1 g x thanks to this isomor phism the previous functor may be identified with the one defined by the direct sum e c v 1 g x e c v 1 g x e c v 1 g x 6 max karoubi universite paris 7 denis diderot we now consider the commutative diagram up to isomorphism e c v 1 g x e c v 1 g x e c 1 g x eg z 2 x e c v 1 g x the horizontal arrows are the algebraic analogs of the map kg z 2 b v s v kg z 2 b v kg z 2 x since the k theory of the first vertical functor is the k theory of the category e c v 1 g x by taking homotopy fibers we see that the group k 1 g z 2 s v k 1 g p v is isomorphic to the grothendieck group of the functor e c v 1 g x e c 1 g x by considering iterated suspensions of x and using bott periodicity and periodicity of the clifford algebra we deduce the theorem for w 0 the general case follows from the category diagram e c v 1 g x e c 1 g x e c w 1 g x e c 1 g x 4 relation with twisted k theory let us turn our attention to atiyah s kr theory of a real space x i e a space with involution we denote by g the group z 2 and assume that g is acting freely on x with quotient space y x g in the case when x y g atiyah showed that kr x is the usual ku theory of the space y 4 in general let us call l the real line bundle on y associated to the covering x x g and let us consider the clifford bundle c l over y note that c l 1 l is the trivial complex line bundle y c when the previous covering is trivial theorem 4 1 with the above notations the group kr x is natu rally isomorphic to the twisted k theory of y associated to the clifford algebra bundle c l proof let e be a real bundle on x in the sense of atiyah viewed as a real bundle it is the pull back of a real bundle f on y so that f e g the complex structure on e does not come from a complex structure on f since e is not a complex g bundle but it induces on the quotient by g a pairing real k theories 7 l f f and we can choose a metric on f such that f becomes a c l module this map e 7 f defines the required correspondance in order to show it induces a k isomorphism we may use for instance a mayer vietoris argument since the statement is true when x y g it is interesting to describe the exact sequence in example 2 4 kr x kog x kog x r with more familiar terms the key lemma for this is the following lemma 4 2 let l be a real line bundle on a space y provided with a metric then the k theory of the forgetful functor ec l y e y is isomorphic to the k theory of the forgetful functor associated to pos itive clifford algebras ec l 2 y ec l 1 y proof we first notice the k theory equivalence between the sources and the targets indeed if e is vector bundle on y l 1 e is a c l 1 module taking into account that l l 1 once a metric is chosen this correspondance induces an isomorphism be tween k y and the twisted k theory associated to the algebra bundle c l 1 using morita equivalence and a mayer vietoris argument in the same way we proved above that the categories ec l y and ec l 2 y are equivalent more precisely if f is a c l module we associate to it the module f f over the algebra bundle c l 2 the issue is now to prove that the category diagram ec l y e y ec l 2 y ec l 1 y induces a commutative diagram between the associated k groups the vertical arrows being isomorphisms this is checked by diagram chas ing the key remark being that if f is a c l module the canonical map l f f is an isomorphism proposition 4 3 let x be a free g space with g z 2 and y x g then the general exact sequence 8 max karoubi universite paris 7 denis diderot ko 1 g x r kr x kog x kog x r is isomorphic to the exact sequence associated to twisted k groups k k ec l y k e y k 1 where is the forgetful functor ec l y e y proof let l be the real line bundle associated to the covering x y according to the lemma the k theory of is isomorphic to the k theory of the functor ec l 2
