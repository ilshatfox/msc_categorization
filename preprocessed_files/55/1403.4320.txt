hopkins and charles rezk abstract we extend the theory of thom spectra and the associated ob struction theory for orientations in order to support the construction of the e string orientation of tmf the spectrum of topological modular forms specifically we show that for an e ring spectrum a the classical construc tion of gl 1 a the spectrum of units is the right adjoint of the functor ho connective spectra ho e ring spectra to a map of spectra f b bgl 1 a we associate an e a algebra thom spectrum mf which admits an e a algebra map to r if and only if the composition b bgl 1 a bgl 1 r is null the classical case developed by 28 arises when a is the sphere spec trum we develop the analogous theory for a ring spectra if a is an a ring spectrum then to a map of spaces f b bgl 1 a we associate an a module thom spectrum mf which admits an r orientation if and only if b bgl 1 a bgl 1 r is null our work is based on a new model of the thom spectrum as a derived smash product contents

three of us ando hopkins rezk construct an e string orientation of tmf the spectrum of topological modular forms more precisely we construct a map of e ring spectra from the thom spectrummo 8 also known as mstring to the spectrum tmf whose value on homotopy rings refines the witten genus from mstring to the ring of integral modular forms for sl 2 z as explained by hopkins in his icm address 16 the argument requires a new formulation of the obstruction theory for orientations of 28 in terms of the adjoint relationship between the units of a commutative ring spectrum and a central goal of this paper is to establish this formulation this new picture of the obstruction theory is motivated by a description of the thom spectrum originally due to the fourth author another purpose of the paper is to study this construction of the thom spectrum for example we use it to extend the classical theory by developing an obstruction theory for orientations of a ring spectra we also use it to build thom spectra in situations more general than stable spherical fibrations these more general situations give rise to twisted generalized cohomology to carry out these extensions we use certain relatively recently developed rigid point set models for a and e spaces 1 1 recollection of the discrete case we begin by describing the algebraic model that motivates our approach let r be a discrete ring and let g gl 1 r a bundle of free rank one r modules over x is classified by a map f x bg let p x be the associated principal g bundle we d like to attach an r module thom spectrum mf to this situation in such a way that trivializations of p over x can be understood in terms of r module maps mf r for simplicity we ll further assume that x is discrete then p is the g set p x x px and we can form the r module algebraic thom spectrum mf z p z g r 1 1 formation of the tensor product uses the fact that the adjunction z sets abelian groups oo induces an adjunction z g sets z g modules oo so z p is a z g module also z restricts to give an adjunction z groups rings gl 1 oo 1 2 whose counit is the natural ring homomorphism z g r 1 3 using these adjunctions one checks easily that r modules mf r g sets p r units orientations and thom spectra 3 and with respect to this isomorphism the set of orientations of mf is the subset r modules mf r g sets p r orientations mf r oo oo g sets p g oo oo which in turn is isomorphic to the set of trivializations of the principal g bundle p x 1 2 the space of units and orientations our approach to the thom spectrum functor develops the approach sketched above for a general space x and a ring spectrum r following 28 when r is an a ring spectrum in the sense of 22 we can define the space of units of r to be the pullback in the diagram of unpointed spaces gl 1 r r 0 r 0 r if x is any space then x gl 1 r f r 0 x 0 f x 0 r r 0 x which provides a justification for the definition more conceptually we show in sec tion 2 that this definition of units can be interpreted as the space of automorphisms of r as an r module working with the models of 22 we have continuous i e topologically enriched adjunctions analogous to 1 2 group like a spaces a spaces gl 1 oo a ring spectra gl 1 oo 1 4 where the right hand adjunction is a special case of 22 p 366 thus one can make sense of a map of a ring spectra gl 1 r r analogous to 1 3 however classical technology does not make it straightforward to describe the adjunction right r modules right r modules oo and moreover since gl 1 r is not a topological group or monoid but rather only a group likea space it is not immediately apparent how to form the quasi fibration gl 1 r egl 1 r bgl 1 r and then make sense of the construction 1 1 our strategy which we carry out in 3 is to use a rigid model of a spaces specifically we use a model of spaces equipped with a symmetric monoidal product such that strict monoids for this product are precisely a spaces 7 in this setting we can form a version of gl 1 r which is a group like monoid and then model egl 1 r bgl 1 r as a quasi fibration with an action of gl 1 r given a map f b bgl 1 r 4 ando blumberg gepner hopkins and rezk gl 1 r acts on the pullback p in the diagram p egl 1 r b f bgl 1 r and the spectrum p becomes a right gl 1 r module we can then imitate 1 1 to form an r module thom spectrum as the derived smash product mf def p l gl 1 r r with this definition we find that right r modules mf r right gl 1 r spaces p r 1 5 where here and in the remainder of this subsection we are referring to derived mapping spaces the space of orientations of mf is the subspace of r module maps mf r which correspond to right gl 1 r modules p gl 1 r right gl 1 r modules p r under the weak equivalence 1 5 that is we have a homotopy pullback diagram orientations mf r right gl 1 r spaces p gl 1 r right r modules mf r right gl 1 r modules p r we obtain an obstruction theoretic characterization of the space of orientations mf r as follows it is weakly equivalent to the derived space of lifts in the diagram p egl 1 r b f bgl 1 r we are able to use this to recover the classical picture of an orientation and also the thom isomorphism recall that a stable spherical fibration is classified by a map b bf where f colimv haut s v and the colimit is over finite dimensional subspaces of r and inclusions the space bf gives a particularly convenient model for bgl 1 s the generalized construction we study in this paper associates an r module thom spectrum mf to a map f b bgl 1 r for any ring spectrum r f need not classify a stable spherical fibration to compare to the classical situation we suppose that f does arise from a stable spherical fibration as the composite f b g bgl 1 s bgl 1 bgl 1 r it follows directly from the definition that mf mg l r we define an r orientation of mg to be a map of spectra mg r such that the induced map of r modules mf r is an orientation as above we then can units orientations and thom spectra 5 show that the space of r orientations of mg is the space of indicated lifts in the diagram p b s r egl 1 r b bgl 1 s bgl 1 r where b s r is the pullback in the solid diagram this generalizes to the a case the work of may quinn ray and tornehave 41 28 remark 1 6 in the companion paper 3 we prove that when g classifies a stable spherical fibration then the spectrum mg constructed in this paper coincides with the thom spectrum associated to g via the theory of 22 1 3 the spectrum of units and e orientations to see how our construc tions work when r is an e ring spectrum once again it is illuminating first to consider the discrete case suppose that r is a commutative ring then g gl 1 r is an abelian group and we can choose a model of bg that is an abelian group as well now suppose that x is a discrete abelian group and f x bg is a homo morphism then in the pullback diagram p eg x f bg p g x is an abelian group and so the discrete thom spectrum mf z p z g r r x is a commutative ring indeed it is the pushout in the diagram of commutative rings z g r z p mf where the homomorphism z g r is the counit of the adjunction z abelian groups commutative rings gl 1 oo which is the restriction to abelian groups of the adjunction 1 2 turning to spaces and spectra the adjunction 1 4 restricts to an adjunction group like e spaces e spaces gl 1 oo e ring spectra gl 1 oo in the e case there is the additional classical fact e g see 26 that the category of group like e spaces is a model for connective spectra therefore if r is an e ring spectrum then there is a spectrum gl 1 r such that gl 1 r gl 1 r putting all this together we see that the functor gl 1 participates as the right adjoint in an adjunction ho 1 connected spectra ho e ring spectra gl 1 oo 1 7 6 ando blumberg gepner hopkins and rezk which preserves the homotopy types of derived mapping spaces in contrast to the a setting this adjunction can be constructed by assembling results in the literature particularly work of may however as we worked through this we found it very useful to reformulate the statements and proofs in a way which reflects advances in the state of the art since the original work was done in section 5 we give a modern proof of this adjunction carefully rederiving and explaining the many classical results involved assuming this development in section 4 we work out the theory of e thom spectra generalizing our new model of a thom spectra and establish results about orientations as used in the construction of the string orientation of tmf let r be an e ring spectrum and suppose that b is a spectrum over bgl 1 r gl 1 r let p be the homotopy pullback gl 1 r gl 1 r p egl 1 r b f bgl 1 r 1 8 the e r algebra thom spectrum mf of f b bgl 1 r is then defined to be the homotopy pushout in the diagram of e r algebras r gl 1 r r r p mf 1 9 where the top map is induced from the counit of the adjunction 1 7 since the homotopy pushout of e ring spectra coincides with the derived smash product this generalizes the definition in the a setting for the obstruction theory suppose r a is a map of e ring spectra then we have the solid commutative diagram gl 1 r gl 1 a p 99 s s s s s s egl 1 a b f 99 s s s s s s bgl 1 a 1 10 where we write bgl 1 r bgl 1 a for the induced map units orientations and thom spectra 7 using the adjunction 1 7 we prove that there is a homotopy pullback diagram of derived mapping spaces where s denotes the category of spectra e r algebras mf a map s p gl 1 a map s gl 1 r gl 1 a that is the space of r algebra maps m a is weakly equivalent to the space of lifts in the diagram 1 10 1 4 twisted generalized cohomology our r module thom spectra locate twisted generalized cohomology in stable homotopy theory from this point of view bgl 1 r classifies the twists let f x bgl 1 r be a map and let mf be the asociated r module thom spectrum the f twisted r homology of x is r f kx def 0 mapr mod kr mf kmf while the f twisted r cohomology of x is rkfx def 0 mapr mod mf kr if f factors as f x g bgl 1 s i bgl 1 r 1 11 then we have mf mg l r and so r f k x kmf k mg l r rkmg rkf x 0 mapr mod mf kr 0 maps mod mg kr rkmg that is the f twisted homology and cohomology coincide with the untwisted r homology and cohomology of the usual thom spectrum of the spherical fibration classified by g thus the constructions in this paper exhibit twisted generalized cohomology as the cohomology of a generalized thom spectrum in general the twists correspond to maps x bgl 1 r the ones which arise from thom spec tra of spherical fibrations are the ones which factor as in 1 11 we discuss the relationship to other approaches to twisted generalized cohomology in 4 1 5 historical remarks and related work in his 1970 mit notes 41 1 sul livan introduced the classical obstruction theory for orientations and suggested that dold s theory of homotopy functors 12 could be used to construct the space b s r of r oriented spherical fibrations he also mentioned that the technology to construct the delooping bgl 1 r was on its way soon thereafter may quinn ray and tornehave in 28 constructed the space bgl 1 r in the case that r is an e ring spectrum and described the associated obstruction theory for orientations of spherical fibrations various aspects of the theory of units and thom spectra have been revisited by a number of authors as the foundations of stable homotopy theory have advanced for example schlichtkrull 36 studied the units of a symmetric ring spectrum and 1 in the version available at http www maths ed ac uk aar books gtop pdf see the note on page 236 http www maths ed ac uk aar books gtop pdf 8 ando blumberg gepner hopkins and rezk may and sigurdsson 33 have studied units and orientations from the perspective of their categories of parametrized spectra recently may has prepared an au thoritative paper revisiting operad ring spaces and operad ring spectra from a modern perspective 27 which has substantial overlap with some of the review of the classical foundations in section 5 1 6 acknowledgments we thank peter may for his many contributions to this subject and for useful conversations and correspondence we are also very grateful to mike mandell for invaluable help with many parts of this project we thank jacob lurie for helpful conversations and encouragement we thank john lind for pointing out an error in a previous draft some of the results in section 3 are based on work in the 2005 university of chicago ph d thesis of the second author he would like to particularly thank his advisors may and mandell for all of their assistance 2 the space of units in this section we recall the classical definition of gl 1 r and explain how to use modern categories of spectra to interpret the units as a model for the derived space of homotopy automorphisms of the ring spectrum r this preliminary work pro vides necessary foundations for our analysis of our new construction of the thom spectrum functor in section 3 we do not make any particular claim to novelty in this section in particular may and sigurdsson provide an excellent discussion of the situation in 33 22 2 although note that our use of end and aut is slightly dif ferent than theirs and the conceptual description we describe is of course implicit in the original definition in 28 given an a or e ring spectrum r in the classical sense e g see 22 the classical construction of the the group like a or e space gl 1 r is as follows definition 2 1 the space gl 1 r is the pullback in the diagram gl 1 r r 0 r 0 r since the right hand vertical map is a fibration the pullback computes the homo topy pullback if x is any space then x gl 1 r f r 0 x 0 f x 0 r r 0 x which provides a justification for this definition we now explain how to interpret glr as the space of homotopy automorphisms of r as an r module to begin we need to work in a modern category of spectra in order to have a sensible category of r modules assume that s is a suitable symmetric monoidal topological model category of spectra and let r be an s algebra i e a monoid in s the category of r modules inherits a model structure and by the space of homotopy automorphisms of r we mean the subspace of the derived mapping space mapr mod r r consisting of weak equivalences in order to make this notion homotopically meaningful we need to ensure that the mapping space has the right homotopy type units orientations and thom spectra 9 definition 2 2 if r is a cofibrant fibrant s algebra and m is a cofibrant fibrant r module then the space of endomorphisms of m is end m def mapr mod m m this has a product induced by composition and by definition the space of homotopy automorphisms of m is the subspace of group like components that is aut m gl 1 end m is the pullback in the diagram aut m end m 0 end m 0 end m since m is cofibrant and fibrant we can equivalently define aut m to be the subspace of end m consisting of the homotopy equivalences if r is an arbitrary algebra then the derived space of endomorphisms of r is the homotopy type end r end r def mapr mod r r where r is a cofibrant fibrant replacement of r as an algebra and r is a cofibrant fibrant replacement of r as a module over itself the derived space of homotopy automorphisms of r is the homotopy type of the subspace aut r aut r end r of homotopy equivalences of r in analogy with the notation gl 1 r we have elected to use the notation aut r for the space of homotopy automorphisms ofr even though it is not a strict group as defined we have presented aut r as a group like topological or simplicial monoid in practice it is easier to access this homotopy type if we let rc be a cofibrant replacement of r and rf a fibrant replacement then we have a weak homotopy equivalence of spaces end r mapr mod r c rf with aut r equivalent to the subspace of weak equivalences we now compare aut r to gl 1 r in the setting of the s modules of 13 let s be the lewis may steinberger category of spectra let s l denote the category of l spectra let ms denote the associated topological model category of s modules and write u ms s for the forgetful functor proposition 2 3 let r be a cofibrant s algebra or commutative s algebra in ms then there are natural zig zag of equivalences end r ur and aut r gl 1 r and a zig zag of natural equivalences between the inclusion of derived mapping spaces aut r end r and the inclusion map gl 1 r r 10 ando blumberg gepner hopkins and rezk proof in the model structure on r modules all objects are fibrant thus we can use r for rf in the notation of 13 s l l s is a cofibrant replacement for s as an s module and r s l s is a cofibrant replacement for r as an r module so the derived mapping space map mr rc rf is given by map mr r s l s 0 r mapms s s l s 0 r maps l l s 0 fl s r maps s 0 fl s r fl s r where fl denotes the mapping space in l spectra by 13 i cor 8 7 the natural map of l spectra r fl s r is a weak equivalence of l spectra and so of spectra the weak equivalence map mr r s l s 0 r r follows since preserves weak equivalences by comparing pullback diagrams it is then straightforward to see that the subspace of r module weak equivalences corresponds to gl 1 r the proof of the preceding proposition illustrates how useful it is that in the lewis may steinberger and elmendorf kriz mandell may categories of spectra an algebra or commutative algebra r is automatically fibrant as a module over itself so that r is homotopically meaningful in particular since gl 1 r is identified as a subspace of r it is evident how to identify the multiplicative structure on gl 1 r as we shall see in section 3 this simplifies our analysis substantially remark 2 4 in the setting of a category of diagram spectra c e g orthogo nal spectra the situation is somewhat more complicated for an associative s algebra r one can carry out a similar analysis after passing to a cofibrant fibrant replacement of r as an s algebra and the pullback description of gl 1 r in fact yields a genuine topological monoid 33 22 2 3 but the situation for commuta tive s algebras in the diagrammatic setting is different the model structure on commutative s algebras is lifted from the positive model structure on orthogonal spectra and in this model structure the underlying s module of a cofibrant fibrant commutative s algebra will not be fibrant indeed its zero space will be s 0 and so map c s r s 0 6 map c s 0 rf hend r of course one can instead replace the given commutative s algebra by an associa tive s algebra instead but in this case it is impossible to recover the e structure on gl 1 r to describe gl 1 r in this setting requires a different construction see 36 or 21 for a description the problem that arises above is a manifestation of lewis s theorem 20 about the nature of symmetric monoidal categories of spectra if s s 0 is cofibrant as it is in diagram categories of spectra then the zero space of a cofibrant fibrant commutative s algebra must not be homotopically meaningful as otherwise we could make a cofibrant fibrant replacement s of s and map c s s qs 0 units orientations and thom spectra 11 would realize qs 0 as a commutative topological monoid on the other hand if the zero space of a cofibrant fibrant commutative s algebra is homotopically meaning ful then s cannot be cofibrant and the adjunction must take a modified form as it does in the setting of elmendorf kriz mandell may spectra 3 a thom spectra and orientations in this section we describe a new model of the thom spectrum functor and ap ply it to the study of orientations of a ring spectra the technical foundation of our model is recent work on rigid models of infinite loop spaces that constructs symmetric monoidal categories of spaces such that monoids and commutative monoids model a and e spaces there are now several well developed cate gories of rigid spaces notably modules the space level analogue of elmendorf mandell kriz may s modules and i spaces the space level analogue of symmetric spectra 7 we work with modules because the version of the adjunction in this setting is technically felicitous for dealing with units as explained in section 2 the essential strategy is to adapt the operadic smash product of 19 13 to the category of spaces specifically we produce a symmetric monoidal product on a model of the category t of topological spaces such that monoids for this product are precisely a spaces in particular this allows us to work with models of gl 1 r which are strict monoids for the new product the observation that one could carry out the program of 13 in the setting of spaces is due to mike mandell and was worked out in the thesis of the second author 6 a detailed presentation of the theory along with complete proofs has appeared in 7 and see also 21 in order to alleviate the burden on the reader below we give a very streamlined exposition focused on the precise properties we need with careful citations the results we need that are not in the literature are proved below 3 1 the categories of l spaces and modules we begin by reviewing the linear isometries operad 13 i 3 fix a countably infinite dimensional real vector space u topologized as the colimit of its finite dimensional subspaces and let l k denote the space of linear isometries u k u given the usual function space topology observe that l 0 is a point and l 1 is a monoid with unit given by the identity map u u each space l k has a free right action of k by permutations and is contractible and the structure maps induced from the direct sum of linear isometries make the collection l k into an e operad if we ignore the permutations the linear isometries operad is an a operad let t denote the category of compactly generated weak hausdorff spaces we define an l space to be a space with an action of l 1 and write t l for the cat egory of l spaces mimicking the definition of the smash product of l spectra in the development of elmendorf kriz mandell may we have an associative and com mutative product x y on the category t l 7 4 1 4 2 given by the coequalizer in the diagram l 2 l 1 l 1 x y 1 1 l 2 x y x l y here denotes the map using the l algebra structure of x and y and denotes the operad structure map l 2 l 1 l 1 l 2 the left action of l 1 on l 2 induces an action of l 1 on x y 12 ando blumberg gepner hopkins and rezk there is a corresponding internal mapping object fl 7 4 3 4 4 the product is weakly unital in the sense that for any l space x there is a natural map x x which is a weak equivalence 7 4 5 4 6 theorem 3 1 7 4 16 the category t l of l spaces is a topological model cat egory with weak equivalences the underlying equivalences of spaces the forgetful functor t l t is the right adjoint of a quillen equivalence the product is a version of the cartesian product of spaces specifically for x and y cofibrant objects of t l there is a canonical map induced by the universal property of the product x y x y that is a weak equivalence 7 4 24 this suggests that to study a spaces one might consider the category of monoids in t l i e the category t l t of algebras in t l over the associated monad tx n x x n these monoids model a spaces structured by the linear isometries operad proposition 3 2 7 4 8 let a denote the monad on the category t associated to the non symmetric linear isometries operad then the category t a of a algebras is equivalent to the category t l t remark 3 3 as one would hope commutative monoids in t l are e spaces however since we do not need the commutative theory herein we have chosen to omit discussion of it in order to have a symmetric monoidal category we restrict to the unital objects we define the category m of modules to be the full subcategory of l spaces such that the unit map x x is a homeomorphism 7 4 9 when restricted to m we will continue to write for the product and f for the internal mapping object fl we then have the following result theorem 3 4 7 4 17 the category m of modules is a closed symmetric monoidal topological model category with product unit and internal hom f the weak equivalences are the maps which are underlying weak equiva lences of spaces the forgetful functor m t is the right adjoint of a quillen equivalence all objects in the model structure on m are fibrant 7 4 18 the inclusion m t l has a right adjoint given by the functor x it is formal that right adjoints on t l can therefore be lifted to m by applying this functor the monad t restricts to m and the model structure on m lifts to a topo logical model structure on m t in which the weak equivalences and fibrations are determined by the forgetful functor m t m 7 4 19 lemma 3 5 7 4 12 let m be an a algebra in t over the linear isometries operad then l m is a monoid in m associated to a monoid m in m we can consider the category of modules if g is a monoid in m then a g module is an object of m equipped with a map g p p units orientations and thom spectra 13 satisfying the usual associativity and unit conditions we write mg for the category of g modules theorem 3 6 the category mg is a topological model category in which the fi brations and weak equivalences are determined by the forgetful functor mg m proof the proof of this result is analogous to the proof of 7 4 16 specifically we regard the category mg as the category of algebras in m over the monad g since m is a cofibrantly generated topological model category with all objects fibrant and satisfying suitable smallness hypotheses on the generating cofibrations we can apply the standard techniques for lifting model structures to monadic algebras e g see 7 4 15 let a denote either the category t l or m as usual we say that a monoid m in a is group like if 0 m is a group let a t denote the full subcategory of a t consisting of group like objects because an a space is precisely a monoid in t l definition 2 1 can be interpreted as a functor gl 1 m t t l t composing with produces a functor gl 1 m t m t which is the right adjoint to the inclusion m t m t given a monoid m we will be interested in the bar construction thus we will need to employ geometric realization in m given a simplicial object x in m there is a natural homeomorphism u x ux 7 4 26 where here u denotes the forgetful functor to spaces as in 7 3 1 we say that a simplicial object x in m is good if the degeneracies are h cofibrations in the following sense a morphism x y in a is an h cofibration if the map x i x y y i has a retract in this case the underlying simplicial space ux is good in the classical sense 39 a given a monoid m in m t and right and left m modules x and y we can define the bar construction as the geometric realization in m of the simplicial object with k simplices bk x m y x m m m k y with the usual simplicial structure maps induced by the multiplication on m and the action maps on x and y in particular we define b g b g and e g b g g notice that e g becomes a g module via the action on the right and the map e g b g becomes a map of g modules when we give b g the trivial action b g g b g b g by inspection of the definition of 7 4 1 we see that the fiber at the basepoint of this map is precisely the realization of the simplicial object with k simplices g which is homeomorphic to g again let a denote one of the categories t l or m we say that an object of a t is a well based monoid in 14 ando blumberg gepner hopkins and rezk a if the unit map 1 a m is an h cofibration when m is a well based monoid these simplicial objects are good 7 3 2 in order to understand the homotopy type of b g we recall that we have a continuous strong symmetric monoidal functor q t l t that is the left adjoint to the functor which gives a space the trivial l action 7 4 13 4 14 the functor q comes equipped with a natural transformation u q which is a weak equivalence when applied to cofibrant objects in t l m or m t 7 4 27 in fact we have the following comparison results theorem 3 7 the functor q induces a quillen equivalence between m and t and a quillen equivalence between mg and qgt where the latter is equipped with the standard model structure determined by the underlying equivalences proof the proof of 7 4 27 shows that the left adjoint functor q m t preserves cofibrations and weak equivalences between cofibrant objects therefore q is a left quillen adjoint sinceq is strong symmetric monoidal it lifts to a functor q mg qgt since the model structure on mg is lifted from m an analogous elaboration of the argument for 7 4 27 shows that q is a quillen left adjoint in this setting as well since the right adjoint preserves all weak equivalences and q preserves weak equivalences between cofibrant objects in each case q induces a quillen equivalence since q is a continuous left adjoint it commutes with geometric realization as a particular consequence we see that qb g bqg where b denotes the usual bar construction for the topological monoid qg since ub g qb g is a weak equivalence this identifies the bar construction as the usual one applied to the rectification qg this comparison allows us to show the that the map e g b g is a quasifibration in the following sense theorem 3 8 let g be a group like cofibrant object in m t which is well based then the map ue g ub g is a quasifibration of spaces proof by the remarks above qe g e qg and qb g b qg by natu rality there is a commutative diagram ue g u e qg q ub g f b qg for any p ub g u 1 p ug 1 p g by inspection of the definition of 7 4 1 furthermore q 1 fp qg and the map between them is induced from the natural transformation u q writing f u p for the homotopy fiber of u at p and f q fp for the homotopy fiber of q at fp we have a commutative diagram ug u 1 p f u p qg q 1 fp f q fp units orientations and thom spectra 15 where the horizontal maps are the natural inclusions of the actual fiber in the ho motopy fiber the hypotheses on g ensure that the vertical maps are weak equiv alences on the left this follows directly because g is cofibrant and on the right we use the fact that ue g qe g and ub g qb g are weak equivalences since u and q commute with geometric realization and all the simplicial spaces in volved are proper furthermore since qg is a group like topological monoid with a nondegenerate basepoint q is a quasifibration 25 7 6 and so the inclusion of the actual fiber of u in the homotopy fiber of u is an equivalence that is the bottom horizontal map is an equivalence thus we deduce that the top horizontal map is an equivalence and so that u is a quasifibration as one would expect from the definition of the category m the category of elmendorf kriz mandell may s modules is the natural model for the stabilization specifically the adjunction on the category s of lewis may steinberger spectra and the natural equivalence l 1 x l 1 x gives rise to an adjunction l l connecting t l and the elmendorf kriz mandell may category of l spectra 21 7 2 to model this in the setting of modules for an s modules m we define s m l l fl s m where fl s m is the mapping l spectrum 21 7 4 see also 2 6 for discussion of this adjunction we then obtain the following result theorem 3 9 21 7 5 there is a strong symmetric monoidal left quillen functor l m ms the corresponding lax symmetric monoidal right quillen adjoint is s ms m a consequence of theorem 3 9 is the following generalization corollary 3 10 the adjunction l s specializes to a quillen adjunction l mg m g s 3 2 thom spectra assembling adjunctions from the previous section we have the following structured version of the adjunction 1 4 m t m t l gl 1 oo ms t gl 1 s oo 3 11 taking a cofibrant replacement gl 1 r c in the category m t we have a com posite map of s modules l gl 1 r c l gl 1 r r where the second map is the counit of the adjunction in equation 3 11 using corollary 3 10 we conclude the following lemma lemma 3 12 the map gives r the structure of a left l gl 1 r c module we can now give the definition of the thom spectrum functor for convenience assume that r is a cofibrant s algebra we will regard the input as a map f x b gl 1 r c 16 ando blumberg gepner hopkins and rezk of modules this entails no loss of generality as we now explain suppose that we are given more classical input data in the form of a map of spaces f x b gl 1 r by adjunction this is equivalent to a map f lx b gl 1 r in t l applying l yields a map of modules f llx l b gl 1 r b gl 1 r finally we take the homotopy pullback in the diagram x f b gl 1 r c l lx f b gl 1 r where the righthand vertical map is induced by the cofibrant replacement gl 1 r c gl 1 r in m t definition 3 13 let f x b gl 1 r c be a map in m the thom spectrum of f is the functor m m b gl 1 r c mr given by mf def l p l gl 1 r c r where here p denotes a cofibrant replacement as a right gl 1 r c module of the pullback p in the diagram p e gl 1 r c x f b gl 1 r c here f is a fibrant replacement of f by construction l p is then a cofibrant l gl 1 r c module so we are computing the derived smash product moroever since r is cofibrant s algebra the resulting thom spectrum mf is a cofibrant r module remark 3 14 definition 3 13 constructs the thom spectrum directly as a ho motopical functor and a homotopical left adjoint one might hope to construct a point set thom functor which we then derive in the usual fashion but because this definition involves the composite of a right adjoint equivalence the pull back functor from m b gl 1 r c to m gl 1 r c and a left adjoint the functor l l gl 1 r c r from m gl 1 r c to mr it is involved although possible to give a model which can be derived without the intermediate cofibrant replacement step we now want to interpret the notion of orientation in this setting we first observe that for any right r module t there is a natural equivalence of mapping spaces map mr mf t map m l gl 1 r c l p t map m gl 1 r c p s t units orientations and thom spectra 17 note that here we are computing derived mapping spaces because all objects are fibrant in all of the model categories involved in particular taking t r we have map mr mf r map m gl 1 r c p s r 3 15 this gives rise to the following definition of the space of orientations of a thom spectrum definition 3 16 the space of orientations of mf is the subspace of components of the derived mapping space map mr mf r which correspond to map m gl 1 r c p gl 1 r mapm gl 1 r c p s r under the adjunction 3 15 that is we form the homotopy pullback diagram orientations mf r map m gl 1 r c p gl 1 r map mr mf r map m gl 1 r c p s r 3 17 we can provide an obstruction theoretic description of the space of orientations in terms of lifts in the diagram p e g x f b g 3 18 theorem 3 19 suppose that g is a cofibrant group like monoid in m and f is a fibration then there is a natural zigzag of weak equivalences between the derived mapping space map m b g f of lifts in the diagram 3 18 and the derived mapping space map mg p g proof we will deduce this result from the corresponding result for group like monoids e g see 40 8 5 using the functorial rectification process provided by the functor q if g is group like then qg is a group like topological monoid which has the homotopy type of a cw complex and a nondegenerate basepoint therefore ap plying q and taking the homotopy pullback we obtain a square of qg spaces in t p b qg qx e qg such that there is a weak equivalence of derived mapping spaces map t b qg qx e qg map qg t p qg we now use theorem 3 7 on the one hand a straightforward extension of the orem 3 7 implies that q induces a quillen equivalence between m b g and t b qg and so there is an equivalence of derived mapping spaces map m b g x e g mapt b qg qx e qg 18 ando blumberg gepner hopkins and rezk on the other hand since q also induces a quillen equivalence between mg and qgt there is an equivalence of derived mapping spaces map mg p g mapqgt qp qg the proof of the theorem will be complete once we have shown that a cofibrant replacement of qp is naturally weakly equivalent to a cofibrant replacement of p as qg spaces finally this follows because either derived functor associated to a quillen equivalence preserves homotopy limits up to a zigzag of natural weak equiv alences although this result is standard the authors are not aware of a convenient reference and so we briefly remind the reader of the proof the homotopy limit of shape d in the homotopical category c is the right derived functor ho cd ho c of the right adjoint which exists on the level of homotopical categories of the con stant diagram functor since equivalences of homotopical categories or quillen equivalences of cofibrantly generated model categories induce equivalences on di agram categories or quillen equivalences of the projective model structure on the diagram categories the result follows by lifting the isomorphism in the homotopy category to a weak equivalence between cofibrant fibrant objects theorem 3 19 now has the following immediate corollary theorem 3 20 the space of orientations of mf is weakly equivalent to the space of lifts in the diagram 3 18 in particular the spectrum mf is orientable if and only if f x b gl 1 r c is null homotopic since our construction of the thom spectrum takes homotopic classifying maps to weakly equivalent spectra theorem 3 20 implies that an orientation gives rise to an equivalence mf l x r this is a version of the thom isomorphism theorem and we will give a description of the map inducing this equivalence below 3 3 orientations and the thom isomorphism to make contact with famil iar notions of orientation we ll be more explicit about the adjunctions in defini tion 3 16 for this it it helpful to recapitulate some classical computations of thom spectra in our setting lemma 3 21 the thom spectrum of the inclusion of a point b gl 1 r c is a cofibrant r module which is weakly equivalent to r more generally the thom spectrum of a trivial map x b gl 1 r c is weakly equivalent to r l x proof let b gl 1 r c be the inclusion of a point the thom spectrum is p l gl 1 r cr where p is a cofibrant replacement of the homotopy pullback p e gl 1 r c b gl 1 r c units orientations and thom spectra 19 as a gl 1 r c module in m since theorem 3 8 implies that ue gl 1 r c ub gl 1 r c is a quasifibration with fiber gl 1 r c it follows that gl 1 r c p as gl 1 r c modules consideration of the iterated pullback square p p e gl 1 r c x b gl 1 r c implies that p is equivalent to gl 1 r c x as a gl 1 r c module where x has the trivial action in particular we have the following corollary corollary 3 22 since e gl 1 r c we have m e gl 1 r c b gl 1 r c r as r modules now suppose that f x b gl 1 r c is a fibration of modules and let p be the pullback in the diagram p e gl 1 r c x f a 99 r r r r r r b gl 1 r c 3 23 and let m mf if a is a lift as indicated then by functoriality passing to thom spectra along a induces a map of r modules a mf r this is the orientation associated to the lift a conversely suppose that a mf r is a map of r modules each point p p the cofibrant replacement of p as a gl 1 r c module determines a gl 1 r c map gl 1 r c p and therefore a map of l gl 1 r c modules l gl 1 r c l p passing to thom spectra this in turn yields a map of r modules jp gl 1 r c l gl 1 r c r r mf r as p varies the jp assemble we take the adjoint of the composite l p f l gl 1 r c l gl 1 r c l p fr l gl 1 r c l gl 1 r c r p l gl 1 r c r fr r mf a fr r r where the first map is the adjoint of the action map and the second map is induced by functoriality 20 ando blumberg gepner hopkins and rezk the argument for proposition 2 3 shows that s fr r r s r and the resulting map j p s r corresponds to a under the equivalence of derived mapping spaces map mr mf r map mgl 1 r p s r put another way for each q x lemma 3 21 implies that the thom spectrum mq of q x b gl 1 r is non canonically weakly equivalent to r passing to thom spectra gives a map iq mq mf a r a choice of point p p lying over q fixes an equivalence r mq making the diagram r jp mq iq r commute thus we have the following analogue of the standard description of thom classes as in for example 42 definition 14 5 proposition 3 24 suppose that a mf r is a map of r modules then the following are equivalent 1 a is an orientation 2 for each q x the map of r modules iq mq mf a r is a weak equivalence 3 for each p p the map of r modules jp r mf a r is a weak equivalence we conclude by discussing the thom isomorphism in this setting let f x b gl 1 r c be a fibration of modules and suppose that x is cofibrant in m now suppose we are given an orientation in the form of a gl 1 r c map s p gl 1 r c corresponding to an r module map a mf r consider the map x x f 2 b gl 1 r c units orientations and thom spectra 21 where here 2 is the projection onto the second factor induced from the composite x x x passing to pullbacks we obtain the commutative diagram p p e gl 1 r c x x x b gl 1 r c since the map p x x x induced from the map p x and the projection map p x p are compatible with the maps to x the universal property of the pullback induces a map p x p passing to cofibrant replacements as gl 1 r c modules gives us a map between cofibrant fibrant gl 1 r c modules using q and the argument for theorem 3 19 we see that this map represents the identity map on qx qp in the homotopy category of q gl 1 r c spaces and hence is a weak equivalence let p denote a cofibrant replacement of p as a gl 1 r c module since p and x p are cofibrant fibrant objects we can choose a map p x p which lifts the homotopy class of the diagonal map qp qx qp passing to thom spectra we obtain the r module thom diagonal map m l x m next we form the composite m l x m 1 a l x r 3 25 as in 32 to analyze this we compose the orientation s with the map p p x to obtain the composite map of gl 1 r c modules p x p x gl 1 r c now applying the functor l gl 1 r c r produces the thom diagonal equa tion 3 25 on the other hand since s corresponds to a section of the map p x induced by the universal property of the pullback this composite is a weak equiva lence of gl 1 r c modules since l gl 1 r c r preserves weak equivalences of cofibrant gl 1 r c modules we obtain the following proposition proposition 3 26 if a mf r is an orientation then the map of right r modules mf l x mf 1 a l x r is a weak equivalence 4 e thom spectra and orientations in this section we describe the construction and orientation ofe thom spectra generalizing the perspective of section 3 for an e ring spectrum r the space of units gl 1 r can be delooped to form a spectrum of units gl 1 r this is encoded in the basic adjunction ho 1 connected spectra hos e gl 1 oo 4 1 which is proved in 5 see theorem 5 2 here s e denotes the model category of lewis may steinberger e ring spectra in order to support the generalization to 22 ando blumberg gepner hopkins and rezk r algebras we model s e via the quillen equivalent model category ms p of elmendorf mandell kriz may commutative s algebras the connective spectra as a subcategory of ms and as the composite l s see theorem 3 9 we begin by discussing the classical case of stable spherical fibrations the counit of the adjunction above yields a map in homs p hos e l s gl 1 s s assume we are given a map b bgl 1 s where we write bgl 1 s for gl 1 s let j 1 and form the diagram g j gl 1 s gl 1 s cj egl 1 s b bgl 1 s by requiring that the upper left and bottom right squares are homotopy cartesian note that we may also view b as an infinite loop map f b bgl 1 s definition 4 2 the thom spectrum of f or of or of j is the homotopy pushout m of the diagram in ms p l s g l s j l s l s gl 1 s s s l s l s cj m 4 3 which is to say that m l s cj l l s gl 1 s s s l l s g s note that the left hand square in the diagram 4 3 is a homotopy pushout by definition of cj and the fact that l s preserves homotopy pushouts also note that when writing this homotopy pushout we are suppressing the choice of a point set representative of the homotopy class since all objects are fibrant in the model structure on ms p it suffices to choose a cofibrant model for s gl 1 s and subsequently of s g in the model structure on m p 7 4 19 now suppose that r is a commutative s algebra with unit s r let i gl 1 and let k ij g gl 1 r so that we have the solid arrows of the diagram g j k gl 1 s i cj u gl 1 r 4 4 in which the row is a cofiber sequence the homotopy pushout diagram 4 3 and the adjunction 4 1 give the following units orientations and thom spectra 23 theorem 4 5 the derived mapping space map ms p m r is equivalent to the fiber of the map of derived mapping spaces map ms cj gl 1 r mapms gl 1 s gl 1 r over the basepoint associated to the map i gl 1 s gl 1 r that is the map k is the obstruction to the existence of an e map m r and mapms p m r is weakly equivalent to the space of lifts in the diagram 4 4 we have the following e analogue of the usual thom isomorphism theorem 4 6 if map ms p m r is non empty i e if k is homotopic to the trivial map g gl 1 r then we have equivalences of derived mapping spaces map ms p m r map ms g gl 1 r mapms b gl 1 r mapms p l b r more generally suppose that r is a commutative s algebra there is a category mr p of commutative r algebras the functor r s is the left adjoint of a quillen pair connecting mr p and ms p with right adjoint the forgetful func tor therefore we can consider the homotopical adjunction r l su gl 1 u connecting mr and mr p where here u denotes both the forgetful functor mr ms and mr p ms p respectively in further abuse of notation we will sup press u and write gl 1 r for gl 1 ur and l s for l su now given a map b bgl 1 r we obtain a map of cofiber sequences g gl 1 r gl 1 r gl 1 r p 99 s s s s s s egl 1 r b 99 s s s s s s bgl 1 r in which g 1 b and p is the fiber of b bgl 1 r definition 4 7 the r algebra thom spectrum of is the commutative r algebra m defined as the homotopy pushout in mr p of the diagram r l s g r l s gl 1 r r r l s r l s p m again note that the left hand square is automatically a homotopy pushout in mr p which means that m can be taken to be the homotopy pushout of the right hand square or of the composite square the thomr algebra is a generalization of the thomr module of definition 3 13 24 ando blumberg gepner hopkins and rezk lemma 4 8 the underlying r module of the r algebra thom spectrum of is weakly equivalent to the a thom spectrum of proof this follows from a check of the definitions given the fact that the homotopy pushout b a oo c in the category mr p is naturally weakly equivalent to the derived smash product b la c 13 vii 1 6 theorem 4 9 let a be a commutative r algebra and write i gl 1 r gl 1 a for the induced map on unit spectra the derived mapping space map mr p m a is weakly equivalent to the fiber in the map of derived mapping spaces map ms p gl 1 a mapms gl 1 r gl 1 a 4 10 at the basepoint associated to the map i taking a r we see that the space of r algebra orientations of m is the space of lifts egl 1 r b bgl 1 r in this form the obstruction theory is a generalization of the obstruction theory for orientations of a ring spectra in theorem 3 20 to make contact with the classical situation let s be the sphere spectrum and suppose we are given a map g b bgl 1 s so that g classifies a stable spherical fibration now suppose that r is a commutative s algebra with unit s r and let f bgl 1 g b bgl 1 s bgl 1 r then mf mg l r and so extension of scalars induces an equivalence of derived mapping spaces map ms p mg r map mr p mf r if we let b s r be the homotopy pullback in the solid diagram p b s r b bgl 1 s bgl 1 r 4 11 then theorem 4 9 specializes to a result of may quinn ray and tornehave 28 corollary 4 12 the derived space of e maps mg r is weakly equivalent to the derived space of lifts in the diagram 4 11 units orientations and thom spectra 25 5 units after may quinn ray our construction of the thom spectrum in 3 uses a model for the adjunction group like a spaces a spaces gl 1 oo a ring spectra gl 1 oo which is a homotopical refinement of the standard adjunction z groups rings oo for the e case we use the e analog group like e spaces e spaces gl 1 oo e ring spectra gl 1 oo which is modeled on the analogous adjunction z abelian groups commutative rings oo when a is an e ring spectrum gl 1 a is a group like e space since group like e spaces model connective spectra it follows that there is a spectrum gl 1 a such that gl 1 a gl 1 a 5 1 in this section we give a precise model of the adjunction and combine with a modernized version of the delooping result to prove the following theorem theorem 5 2 the functors and gl 1 induce adjunctions ho 1 connected spectra hos e gl 1 oo 5 3 of categories enriched over the homotopy category of spaces note that the construction of this adjunction realizes the left adjoint as a com posite of left quillen adjoints and quillen equivalences and the right adjoint as a composite of right quillen adjoints and quillen equivalences as a consequence the left adjoint preserves homotopy colimits and the right adjoint preserves homotopy limits remark 5 4 in fact theorem 5 2 can be formulated as an adjunction of categories 1 connected spectra s e gl 1 oo see the companion paper 3 and the subsequent paper 4 for a description of such an approach to the thom spectrum functor throughout this section we work in the classical categories s of lewis may steinberger spectra 22 and s e of e ring spectra as we noted in section 4 it is often useful to restate this adjunction using modern models for these homo topy categories since composition with an equivalence of categories preserves the property of being a left or right adjoint such a shift is harmless the reader will notice that a proof of theorem 5 2 can mostly be assembled from results scattered in the literature particularly 24 26 28 22 13 we wrote this section in order to consolidate this material and in order to present modernized treatments using the language of model categories 26 ando blumberg gepner hopkins and rezk remark 5 5 we note that may has prepared a review of the relevant multiplica tive infinite loop space theory 27 which also includes the results we need 5 1 e spectra in this section we review the notion of a c spectrum where c is an operad in spaces over the linear isometries operad we also recall the fact that the homotopy category of e spectra is well defined in the sense that if c andd are two e operads over the linear isometries operad then the categories of c spectra and d spectra are connected by a zig zag of continuous quillen equivalences if c is an operad then for k 0 we write c k for the kth space of the operad we also write c for the associated monad let s su denote the category of spectra based on a universe u in the sense of 22 let l denote the linear isometries operad of u and let c l be an operad over l then cv k 0 c k k v k is the free c algebra on v we write s c for the category of c algebras in s and we call its objects c spectra in general c c 0 is the initial object of the category of c spectra we shall say that c is unital if c 0 so that c 0 s is the sphere spectrum lewis may steinberger work with unital operads and the free c spectrum with prescribed unit if s v is a spectrum under the sphere then we write c v for the free c spectrum on v with unit s v c v this is the pushout in the category of c spectra in the diagram cs c c s cv c v 5 6 by construction c participates in a monad on the category ss of spectra under the sphere spectrum as explained in 13 ii remark 4 9 s v s v defines a monad on s using the fold map s s s and we have an equivalence of categories ss s s it follows that there is a natural isomorphism c v c s v 5 7 and 13 ii lemma 6 1 an equivalence of categories s c ss c we recall the following which can be proved easily using the argument of 13 31 in particular an adaptation of the cofibration hypothesis of vii of 13 proposition 5 8 the category of c spectra has the structure of a cofibrantly gen erated topological model category in which the forgetful functor to s creates fibra tions and weak equivalences if a b is a set of generating trivial cofibrations of s then ca cb is a set of generating trivial cofibrations of s c units orientations and thom spectra 27 in particular the category of c spectra is cocomplete this is explained on pp 46 49 of 13 a fact we use in the following construction let f c d be a map of operads over l so there is a forgetful functor f s d s c we construct the left adjoint f of f as a certain coequalizer in c algebras see 13 ii 6 for further discussion of this construction denote by m dd d the multiplication for d and let a be a c algebra with structure map ca a define f a to be the coequalizer in the diagram of d algebras dca d df da f a dda m 5 9 in fact it s enough to construct f a as the coequalizer in spectra then d applied to the unit a ca makes the diagram a reflexive coequalizer of spectra and so f a has the structure of ad algebra and as such is thed algebra coequalizer 13 ii 6 6 by construction we have the following proposition proposition 5 10 the functor f is a continuous left adjoint to f moreover for any spectrum v the natural map f cv dv 5 11 is an isomorphism remark 5 12 some treatments write c v for the free c algebra cv and then d c a for f a about this adjoint pair there is the following well known result which follows from the fact that f preserves fibrations and weak equivalences proposition 5 13 let f c d be a map of operads over l the pair f f is a continuous quillen pair it is folklore that all e operads over l give rise to the same homotopy theory over the years various arguments have been given to show this starting with may s use of the bar construction to model f see 13 ii 4 3 for the most recent entry in this line we present a model theoretic formulation of this result under mild hypotheses on the operads in the remainder of the subsection proposition 5 14 if f c d is a map of e or a operads then f f is a quillen equivalence more generally if each map f c n d n is a weak equivalence of spaces then f f is a quillen equivalence before giving the proof we make a few remarks assume f is a weak equivalence of operads since the pullback f s d s c preserves fibrations and weak equivalences to show that f f is a quillen equivalence it suffices to show that for a cofibrant c algebra x the unit of the adjunction x f f x is a weak equivalence 28 ando blumberg gepner hopkins and rezk if x cz is a free c algebra then f x f cz dz by 5 11 and so the map in question is the natural map cz dz it follows from propositions x 4 7 x 4 9 and a 7 4 of 13 that if the operad spaces c n and d n are cw complexes and if z is a wedge of spheres or disks then cz dz is a homotopy equivalence in fact this argument applies to the wider class of tame spectra whose definition we now recall definition 5 15 13 definition i 2 4 a prespectrum d is cofibrant if each of the structure maps wd v d v w is a hurewicz cofibration a spectrum z is cofibrant if it is isomorphic to one of the form ld where d is a cofibrant prespectrum and l denotes the spectrification functor 22 i 2 2 a spectrum z is tame if it is homotopy equivalent to a cofibrant spectrum in particular a spectrum z of the homotopy type of a cw spectrum is tame for a general cofibrant x the argument proceeds by reducing to the free case x cz in this paper we present an inductive argument due to mandell 29 a different induction of this sort appeared in 30 in the algebraic setting that argument can be adapted to the topological context with minimal modifications our induction will involve the geometric realization of simplicial spectra as usual we would like to ensure that a map of simplicial spectra f k k in which each fn kn k n is a weak equivalence yields a weak equivalence upon geometric realization the required condition is that the spectra kn and k n are tame theorem x 2 4 of 13 says that the realization of weak equivalences of tame spectra is a weak equivalence if k and k are proper 13 x 2 1 recall that a simplicial spectrum k is proper if the natural map of coends dq 1 kp d q p dq kp d q p kq is a hurewicz cofibration where d is the subcategory of consisting of the mono tonic surjections i e the degeneracies and dq is the full subcategory of d on the objects 0 i q this is a precise formulation of the intuitive notion that the inclusion of the union of the degenerate spectra sjkq 1 in kq should be a hurewicz cofibration thus to ensure that the spectra that arise in our argument are tame and the simplicial objects proper we make the following simplifying assumptions on our operads 1 we assume that the spaces c n and d n have the homotopy type of n cw complexes 2 we assume that c 1 and d 1 are equipped with nondegenerate base points we believe these assumptions are reasonable insofar as they are satisfied by many natural examples for instance the linear isometries operad and the little n cubes operad both satisfy the hypotheses above see 13 xi 1 4 xi 1 7 and 24 4 8 respectively more generally if o is an arbitrary operad over the linear isometries operad then taking the geometric realization of the singular complex of the spaces o produces an operad s o with the properties we require units orientations and thom spectra 29 goerss and hopkins have proved two versions of proposition 5 14 using resolution model structures to resolve an arbitrary cofibrant c space by a simplicial c space with free k simplices for every k a first version 14 proves the proposition for lewis may steinberger spectra avoiding our simplifying assumptions on the oper ads via a detailed study of flatness for spectra as an alternative to the theory of tameness a more modern treatment 15 works with operads of simplicial sets and symmetric spectra in topological spaces in that case as they explain a key point is that if x is a cofibrant spectrum then x n is a free n spectrum see lemma 15 5 of 31 this observation helps explain why the general form of the proposition is reasonable even though the analogous statement for spaces is much too strong we now give the proof of proposition 5 14 under the hypotheses enumerated above proof a cofibrant c spectrum is a retract of a cell c spectrum and so we can assume without loss of generality that x is a cell c spectrum the argument for proposition 5 8 implies that cell objects can be described as x colimnxn where x 0 c and xn 1 is obtained from xn via a pushout in c algebras of the form ca xn cb xn 1 where a b is a wedge of generating cofibrations of spectra furthermore by the proof of proposition 5 8 specifically the cofibration hypothesis the map xn xn 1 is a hurewicz cofibration of spectra the hypotheses on c and the fact that a and b are cw spectra imply that ca and cb have the homotopy type of cw spectra and thus inductively so does xn therefore since f is a left adjoint it suffices to show that xn f f xn is a weak equivalence for each xn under these circumstances a sequential colimit of weak equivalences is a weak equivalence we proceed by induction on the number of stages required to build the c spectrum the base case follows from the remarks preceding the proof for the induction hypothesis assume that f is a weak equivalence for all cell c algebras that can be built in n or fewer stages the spectrum xn 1 is a pushout cb caxn in c algebras and this pushout is homeomorphic to a bar construc tion b cb ca xn which is the geometric realization of a simplicial spectrum where the mth is the coproduct cb m ca xn since f is a continuous left adjoint it commutes with geometric realization and coproducts in c algebras and so f b cb ca xn is homeomorphic to b db da f xn the bar constructions we are working with are proper simplicial spectra by the hypothesis that c 1 and d 1 have nondegenerate basepoints and thus it suffices to show that at each level in the bar construction bq cb ca xn bq db da f xn we have a weak equivalence of tame spectra this follows from the inductive hy pothesis we have already shown that the spectra are tame and cb q ca xn can be built in n stages since xn can be built in n stages and the free algebras can be built and added in a single stage 30 ando blumberg gepner hopkins and rezk the idea of the following corollary goes all the way back to 24 corollary 5 16 if c and d are any two e operads over the linear isometries operad then the categories of c algebras and d algebras are connected by a zig zag of continuous quillen equivalences proof proposition 5 14 allow us to compare each of categories of algebras to alge bras over the linear isometries operad backed by this result we adopt the following convention definition 5 17 we write hos e for the homotopy category of e ring spec tra by this we mean the homotopy category hos c for any e operad c over the linear isometries operad 5 2 e spaces we adopt notation for operad actions on spaces analogous to our notation for spectra in 5 1 let c be an operad in topological spaces the free c algebra on a space x is cx k 0 c k k x k 5 18 we set c c 0 the category of c algebras in spaces or c spaces will be denoted t c note that the sequence of spaces given by p 0 p 1 p k for k 1 has a unique structure of operad whose associated monad is px x so t p t if c is a unital operad and if y is a pointed space let c y be the pushout in the category of c algebras c c cy c y 5 19 then c participates in a monad on the category of pointed spaces indeed c is isomorphic to the monad cmay introduced in 24 since for a test c space t t c c y t t y t t c cmayy t there is a natural isomorphism cx c x and an equivalence of categories t c t c 5 20 part of this equivalence is the observation that if x is a c algebra then it is a c algebra via c x c x cx x units orientations and thom spectra 31 we have the following analogue of proposition 5 8 proposition 5 21 1 the category t c has the structure of a cofibrantly generated topological closed model category in which the forgetful functor to t creates fibrations and weak equivalences if a b is a set of generating trivial cofibra tions of t then ca cb is a set of generating trivial cofibrations of t c 2 the analogous statements hold for c and t c 3 taking c p the resulting model category structure on the category t p t is determined by the forgetful functor to t 4 the equivalence t c t c 5 20 carries the model structure arising from part 1 to the model structure arising from part 2 proof the statements about the model structure on t c or on t c can be proved for example by adapting the argument in 13 31 the third part is standard and together the first three parts imply the last we conclude this subsection with two results which will be useful in 5 5 for the first note that a point of c 0 determines a map of operads p c and so we have a forgetful functor t c t p t we say that a point of y is non degenerate if y is an ndr pair i e that y is a hurewicz cofibration proposition 5 22 suppose that c is a unital operad in topological spaces or more generally an operad in which the base point of c 0 is nondegenerate if x is a cofibrant object of t c then its base point is nondegenerate note that rezk 35 and berger and moerdijk 5 have proved a similar result for algebras in a general model category over an cofibrant operad in our case we need only assume that the zero space c 0 of our operad has a non degenerate base point proof in the model structure described in proposition 5 21 a cofibrant object is a retract of a cell object and so we can assume without loss of generality that x is a cell c space that is x colim n xn 5 23 where x 0 c and xn 1 is obtained from xn as a pushout in c spaces ca xn cb xn 1 5 24 where a b is a disjoint union of generating cofibrations of t our argument relies on a form of the cofibration hypothesis of vii of 13 the key points are the following 1 by assumption x 0 c c 0 is non degenerately based 32 ando blumberg gepner hopkins and rezk 2 the space underlying the c algebra colimit x in 5 23 is just the space level colimit 3 in the pushout above xn xn 1 is a based map and an unbased hurewicz cofibration the second point is easily checked and is the space level analog of lemma 3 10 of 13 for the last part the argument in proposition 3 9 of vii of 13 see also lemma 15 9 of 31 shows that the pushout 5 24 is isomorphic to a two sided bar construction b cb ca xn this is the geometric realization of a simplicial space where the k simplices are given as cb c ca k c xn and the simplicial structure maps are induced by the folding map and the maps ca cb and ca xn note that by c we mean the coproduct in the category of c spaces recall that coproducts and more generally all colimits in c spaces admit a description as certain coequalizers in t specifically for c spaces x and y the coproduct x c y can be described as the coequalizer in t c cx cy c x y x c y where the unmarked coproducts are taken in t and the maps are induced from the action maps and the monadic structure map respectively following an argument along the lines of 13 vii 6 we can show that for any c algebra a and space b the map a a c cb is an inclusion of a component in a disjoint union this implies that the simplicial degeneracy maps in the bar construction are unbased hurewicz cofibrations and hence that the simplicial space is proper that is reedy cofibrant in the hurewicz str m model structure thus the inclusion of the zero simplices cb c xn in the realization is an unbased hurewicz cofibration and hence the map xn xn 1 is itself a unbased hurewicz cofibration as a map of c algebras it s also a based map the second result we need is the following proposition 5 25 let c be an operad and suppose that each c n has the homo topy type of a n cw complex let x be a c space with the homotopy type of a cofibrant c space then cx has the homotopy type of a cofibrant c space and the underlying space of x has the homotopy type of a cw complex proof the first statement is an easy consequence of the fact that c preserves homotopies and cofibrant objects to see the second observe that the forgetful functor preserves homotopies so it suffices to suppose that x is a cofibrant c space under our hypotheses on c if a has the homotopy type of a cw complex then so does the underlying space of ca see for instance page 372 of 22 for a proof the result now follows from an inductive argument along the lines of the preceding proposition 5 3 e spaces and e spectra suppose that c l is an operad over l in this section we recall the proof of the following result units orientations and thom spectra 33 proposition 5 26 28 22 p 366 the continuous quillen pair t s 5 27 induces by restriction a continuous quillen adjunction t c t c s c 5 28 between topological model categories the first thing to observe is that c and satisfy a strong compatibility con dition lemma 5 29 there is a natural isomorphism c x cx 5 30 proof it follows from vi proposition 1 5 of 22 that if x is a space then c k k x k c k k x k and so c x k 0 c k k x k k 0 c k x k k 0 c k xk cx next we have the following from 22 p 366 lemma 5 31 the adjoint pair t s 5 32 induces an adjunction t c s c 5 33 and so also t c t c s c proof we show that the adjunction 5 32 restricts to the adjunction 5 33 if x is a c space with structure map cx x then using the isomorphism 5 30 x is a c algebra via c x cx x if a is a c spectrum then a is a c space via c a ca a the second map is just applied to the c structure on a the first map is the adjoint of the map c a c a ca obtained using the counit of the adjunction this adjunction allows us to prove the pointed analogue of lemma 5 29 34 ando blumberg gepner hopkins and rezk lemma 5 34 22 vii prop 3 5 if c is a unital operad over l then there is a natural isomorphism c y c y c y 5 35 proof let y be a pointed space by lemma 5 31 and the isomorphism 5 30 applying the left adjoint to the pushout diagram 5 19 defining c y identifies c y with the pushout of the diagram 5 6 defining c y the second iso morphism is just the isomorphism 5 7 together with the isomorphism for pointed spaces y y s y proof of proposition 5 26 it remains to show that the adjoint pair in duces a quillen adjunction for this it suffices to show that the right adjoint preserves fibrations and weak equivalences see for example 17 lemma 1 3 4 now recall that the forgetful functor s c s creates fibrations and weak equiv alences and similarly for t 13 31 it follows that the functor s c t c preserves fibrations and weak equivalences since s t does remark 5 36 note that if a is an e ring spectrum then a is an e space in two ways one is described above and arises from the multiplication on a the other arises from the additive structure of a i e the fact that a is an infinite loop space together these two e structures give an e ring space in the sense of 28 see also 27 5 4 e spaces and group like e spaces suppose that c is a unital e operad and let x be a c algebra in spaces the structure maps c 0 x c 2 x x x correspond to a family of h space structures on x and give to 0 x the structure of a monoid definition 5 37 x is said to be group like if 0 x is a group we write t c for the full subcategory of t c consisting of group like c spaces note that if f x y is a weak equivalence of c spaces then x is group like if and only y is definition 5 38 we write hot c for the image of t c in hot c it is the full subcategory of homotopy types represented by group like spaces if x is a c space notice that gl 1 x defined as in definition 2 1 is a group like c space proposition 5 39 the functor gl 1 is the right adjoint of the inclusion t c t c units orientations and thom spectra 35 proof if x is a group like c space and y is a c space then t c x y t c x gl 1 y just as if g is a group and m is a monoid then monoids g m groups g gl 1 m 5 5 group like e spaces and connective spectra a guiding result of infi nite loop space theory is that group like e spaces provide a model for connective spectra we take a few pages to show how the primary sources in particular 8 24 26 may be used to prove a formulation of this result in the language of model categories to begin suppose that c is a unital e operad and f is a map of monads on pointed spaces f c q def for example we can take c to be a unital e operad over the infinite little cubes operad but it is interesting to note that any map of monads will do if v is a spectrum then v is a group like c algebra via the map c v f v v thus we have a factorization s f t c t 5 40 we next show that the functor f has a left adjoint f by regarding a c space x as a pointed space via c 0 x we may form the spectrum x let fx be the coequalizer in the diagram of spectra c x f x fx x 88 then we have the following lemma 5 41 the pair f t c s f 5 42 is a quillen pair moreover the natural transformation fc is an isomorphism proof as mentioned in the proof of proposition 5 10 it is essentially a formal con sequence of the construction that f is the left adjoint of f given the adjunction 36 ando blumberg gepner hopkins and rezk we find that fc since for any pointed space x and any spectrum v we have s fc x v t c c x fv t x v s x v to show that we have a quillen pair it suffices 17 lemma 1 3 4 to show that f preserves weak equivalences and fibrations this follows from the commutativity of the diagram 5 40 the fact that preserves weak equivalences and fibrations and the fact that the forgetful functor t c t creates fibrations and weak equivalences lemma 5 41 implies that the pair f f induce a continuous quillen adjunc tion f t c s f it is easy to see that this cannot be a quillen equivalence instead one expects that it induces an equivalence between the homotopy categories of group like c spaces and connective spectra in 31 0 10 this situation is called a connective quillen equivalence the rest of this subsection is devoted to the proof of the following result along these lines theorem 5 43 suppose that c is a unital e operad equipped with a map of monads f c suppose moreover that 1 the base point c 1 is non degenerate and 2 for each n the n space c n has the homotopy type of a n cw complex then the adjunction f f induces an equivalence of categories f hot c ho connective spectra foo enriched over hot remark 5 44 as observed in 24 a 8 adding a whisker to a degenerate basepoint produces a new operad c from c also if c is a unital e operad equipped with a map of monads f c then taking the geometric realization of the singular complex of the spaces c n produces an operad s c with the properties we require the following lemma easily checked is implicit in 31 let f m m g be a quillen adjunction between topological closed model categories let c m and c m be full subcategories stable under weak equivalence so we have sensible subcategories ho c hom and ho c hom suppose that f takes c to c and g takes c to c units orientations and thom spectra 37 lemma 5 45 if for every cofibrant x c and every fibrant y c a map fx y is a weak equivalence if and only if its adjoint x gy is then f and g induce equivalences f ho c ho c g of categories enriched over hot the key result in our setting is the following classical proposition we recall the argument from 24 26 proposition 5 46 let c be a unital e operad equipped with a map of monads f c suppose that the basepoint c 1 is non degenerate and that each c n has the homotopy type of a n cw complex if x is a cofibrant c space then the unit of the adjunction x f fx is group completion and so a weak equivalence if x is group like the proof of the proposition follows from analysis of the following commutative diagram of simplicial c spaces b c c x f fb c c x x f fx 5 47 specifically we will show that under the hypotheses on passage to realization the vertical maps are weak equivalences and the top horizontal map is group completion we begin by studying the left hand vertical map the usual simplicial contraction argument shows the underlying map of spaces is a homotopy equivalence and so on passage to realizations we have a weak equivalence of c spaces lemma 5 48 for any operad c and any c space x the left vertical arrow is a map of simplicial c spaces and a homotopy equivalence of simplicial spaces and so induces a weak equivalence of c spaces b c c x x upon geometric realization the right vertical map is more difficult to analyze because we do not know that f preserves homotopy equivalences of spaces may 24 12 3 shows that for suitable simplicial pointed spaces y the natural map y y 5 49 is a weak equivalence and he explains in 27 8 how this weak equivalence gives rise to a weak equivalence of c spaces f fb c c x f fb c c x f fb c c x 38 ando blumberg gepner hopkins and rezk by passage to colimits we note that in 27 may describes proving that 5 49 is a weak equivalence as the hardest thing in 24 therefore to show that the map f fb c c x f fx is a weak equivalence it suffices to show that for cofibrant x the map fb c c x fx is a weak equivalence as it is straightforward to check from the definition that f does preserve weak equivalences between c spaces with the homotopy type of cofibrant c spaces the desired result will follow once we show that b c c x has the homotopy type of a cofibrant c space if x is cofibrant lemma 5 50 suppose that c is a unital operad such that the base point c 1 is non degenerate and each c n has the homotopy type of a n cw complex let x be a cofibrant c space then b c c x has the homotopy type of a cofibrant c space proof with our hypotheses it follows from proposition 5 25 that the spaces cn x have the homotopy type of cofibrant c spaces by proposition 5 22 the simplicial space b c c x is proper finally we apply an argument analogous to that of theorem x 2 7 of 13 to show that if y is a proper c space in which each level has the homotopy type of a cofibrant c space then y has the the homotopy type of a cofibrant c space finally we consider the top horizontal map in 5 47 we have isomorphisms of simplicial c spaces f fb c c x b f fc c x b f c x b q c x we used the isomorphism fc of lemma 5 41 and so an isomorphism of c spaces b q c x f fb c c x we then apply the following result from 26 2 lemma 5 51 let c be a unital e operad equipped with a map of monads f c let x be a c space and so pointed via c 0 x suppose that the base point of c 1 and the base point of x are non degenerate then the map b c c x b q c x and so b c c x f fb c c x is group completion proof the point is that in general c y y is group completion 10 9 34 and so we have the level wise group completion c c nx c nx see 26 2 2 the argument requires the simplicial spaces involved to be proper that is reedy cofibrant with respect to the hurewicz str m model structure on topological units orientations and thom spectra 39 spaces so that the homology spectral sequences have the expected e 2 term may proves that they are provided that c 1 and x are ndr pairs we can now finish the proof of theorem 5 43 proof it remains to show that if x is a group like cofibrant c algebra and v is a fibrant 1 connected spectrum then a map fx v is a weak equivalence if and only if its adjoint x fv is these two maps are related by the factorization x f fx f fv the unit of adjunction is a weak equivalence by proposition 5 46 it follows that is a weak equivalence if and only if f is certainly if is a weak equivalence then so is f since both fx and v are 1 connected if f is a weak equivalence then so is remark 5 52 there is another perspective on theorem 5 43 which elucidates the role of the group like condition on c spaces define a map x y of c spaces to be a stable equivalence if the induced map f fx fy is a weak equivalence where x and y are cofibrant replacements of x and y the stable model structure on c spaces is the localization of the model structure we have been considering in which the weak equivalences are the stable equivalences and the cofibrations are as before in this stable model structure a c space is fibrant if and only if it is group like compare the model structure on spaces discussed in 37 and 31 18 the homotopy category associated with the stable model structure is exactly hot c and so this is a better encoding of the homotopy theory of c spaces 5 6 proof of theorem 5 2 let c be unital e operad equipped with a map of operads c l a map of monads on pointed spaces f c and satisfying the hypotheses of theorem 5 43 for example we can take c to be c sing c l the geometric realization of the singular complex on the product operad c l where c is infinite little cubes operad of boardman and vogt 8 then we have a sequence of continuous adjunctions the left adjoints are listed on top and
