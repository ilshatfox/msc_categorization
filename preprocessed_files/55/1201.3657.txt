motivic unstable homotopy category the construction is done via birational invariants this is motivated by the exis tence of an equivalence of categories between the orthogonal components for voevodsky s slice filtration and the birational motivic stable homotopy cat egories constructed in 19 another advantage of this approach is that the slices appear naturally as homotopy fibres and not as in the stable setting where they are defined as homotopy cofibres which behave much better in the unstable setting 1 introduction our main goal is to construct a tower in the motivic unstable homotopy category with similar properties to voevodsky s slice tower 26 in the motivic stable homo topy category in this section we recall voevodsky s definition for the slice filtration and explain why our construction in the unstable setting is a natural analogue definitions and notation in this paper x will denote a noetherian separated base scheme of finite krull dimension schx the category of schemes of finite type over x and smx the full subcategory of schx consisting of smooth schemes over x regarded as a site with the nisnevich topology all the maps between schemes will be considered over the base x given y schx all the closed subsets z of y will be considered as closed subschemes with the reduced structure letm be the category of pointed simplicial presheaves on smx equipped with the motivic quillen model structure 21 constructed by jardine 8 thm 1 1 which is quillen equivalent to the one defined originally by morel voevodsky 8 thm 1 2 taking the affine line a 1 x as interval 13 p 86 thm 3 2 we will write h for its associated homotopy category given a map f y w in smx we will abuse notation and denote by f the induced map f y w in m between the corresponding pointed simplicial presheaves represented by y and w respectively we define t in m as the pointed simplicial presheaf represented by s 1 gm where gm is the multiplicative group a 1 x 0 pointed by 1 and s 1 denotes the simplicial circle given an arbitrary integer r 1 let sr resp grm denote the iterated smash product of s 1 resp gm with r factors s 1 s 1 resp gm gm s 0 g 0 m will be by definition equal to the pointed simplicial presheaf represented by the base scheme x we will use the following notation in all the categories under consideration will denote the terminal object and will denote that a map

homotopy category which is triangulated we will follow jardine s notation 8 p 506 507 where fn denotes the left adjoint to the n evaluation functor spt m evn m em m 0 en notice that f 0 a is just the usual infinite suspension spectrum t a for every integer q z we consider the following family of symmetric t spectra c q eff fn s r gsm u n r s 0 s n q u smx 1 1 where u denotes the simplicial presheaf represented by u with a disjoint base point let q tsh eff denote the smallest full triangulated subcategory of sh which contains c q eff and is closed under arbitrary coproducts voevodsky 26 defines the slice filtration in sh to be the following family of triangulated subcategories q 1 t sh eff q tsh eff q 1 t sh eff it follows from the work of neeman 14 15 that the inclusion iq q t sheff sh has a right adjoint rq sh q t sheff 18 prop 3 1 12 and that the following functors fq sh sh s q sh sh sq sh sh are triangulated where fq is defined as the composition iq rq and s q sq are

2 27 3 together with theorem 3 3 26 proposition 3 3 30 and theorem 3 3 45 in 18 on the other hand the model categories l qspt m admit an alternative de scription which is more suitable for an unstable interpretation for this we fix an 4 pablo pelaez arbitrary integer n 0 and consider the following set of open immersions with smooth closed complement of codimension at least n 1 wbn u y u y open immersion 1 6 y z y u smx y irreducible codimy z n 1 then we take the left bousfield localization of the model category spt m with respect to the set of maps swbn fp g b m u y u y wbr b p r 0 r p b n 1 7 which will be denoted by wbnspt m the main result of 19 is the following comparison theorem theorem 1 8 see theorem 3 6 in 19 let n z be an arbitrary integer then the identity functor id wbnspt m l n 1 spt m is a quillen equivalence now we proceed to describe how the unstable construction is carried out in order to get an analogue for the slice filtration in the motivic unstable homotopy category it is necessary c 1 to remove from the picture as much as possible the role played by the suspensions with respect to s 1 and gm c 2 that the slices appear naturally as homotopy fibres in the tower and not as homotopy cofibres since the former behave much better in the unstable setting if we take c 2 as a guiding principle then the distinguished triangle 1 4 and theorem 1 5 2 3 lead us to consider analogues for the model structures l nspt m in the motivic unstable homotopy category m once these model structures wbnm have been defined we obtain a tower of left quillen functors m id id wbn 1 m id wbnm id id wb 1 m id wb 0 m thus the derived adjunctions induce for every simplicial presheaf a m a natural tower in h a a n 1 tn 1 a a n tn a a n 1 a 2 t 2 a a 1 t 1 a a 0 and the n slice is then defined as the homotopy fibre of an i e the following is a homotopy fibre sequence in h sn a tn 1 a tn a now the only problem that remains is the construction of the model structures wbnm for this we consider c 1 and rely on theorem 1 8 hence it is natural to define wbnm as the left bousfield localization of the model categorym with respect to the set of maps wbn described in 1 6 we now describe the contents of the paper in section 2 we construct the weakly birational motivic homotopy categories wbnm as well as a natural generalization that we call birational motivic homotopy categories and prove a comparison theo rem between them when the base scheme is a perfect field see definitions 2 6 2 11 proposition 2 13 and theorem 2 14 in section 3 we define the unstable slices the unstable slice filtration 5 and describe some of their properties see proposition 3 11 and theorem 3 16 in section 4 we describe the unstable slice spectral sequence see theorem 4 3 in section 5 we study the behavior of the unstable slice tower with respect to trans fers in the sense of voevodsky and construct an unstable slice tower for simplicial presheaves with transfers see proposition 5 2 and theorem 5 7 in section 6 we work over the complex numbers in order to study the behavior of the unstable slice tower with respect to the functor of complex points and compare it with the clas sical postnikov tower of algebraic topology see proposition 6 5 theorem 6 9 and remark 6 11 in section 7 we characterize the unstable slices study the unstable slice tower for the infinite loop space of a stable slice and carry out some computa tions of unstable slices see theorem 7 5 propositions 7 8 7 9 example 7 10 and theorems 7 13 7 17 7 20 7 22 7 25 2 birational and weakly birational motivic homotopy categories in this section we construct the birational and weakly birational motivic ho motopy categories these are defined as left bousfield localizations of m with respect to maps which are induced by open immersions with a numerical condition in the codimension of the closed complement which is assumed to be smooth in the weakly birational case the left bousfield localizations are constructed following hirschhorn s approach 5 in order to be able to apply hirschhorn s techniques it is necessary to know thatm is cellular 5 def 12 1 1 and proper 5 def 13 1 1 theorem 2 1 see 5 thm 4 1 1 let a be a quillen model category which is cellular and proper let l be a set of maps in a then the left bousfield localization of a with respect to l exists for details and definitions about bousfield localization we refer the reader to hirschhorn s book 5 the following result guarantees the existence of left bousfield localizations for the unstable motivic homotopy categorym theorem 2 2 the quillen model category m is 1 cellular see 6 cor 1 6 or 18 thm 2 3 2 2 proper see 8 thm 1 1 now we describe the open immersions which will be used to construct the left bousfield localizations ofm definition 2 3 see 20 section 7 5 let y schx and z a closed subscheme of y the codimension of z in y codimy z is the infimum over the generic points zi of z of the dimensions of the local rings oy zi since x is noetherian of finite krull dimension and y is of finite type over x codimy z is always finite definition 2 4 we fix an arbitrary integer n 0 and consider the following set of open immersions which have a closed complement of codimension at least n 1 bn u y u y open immersion y smx y irreducible codimy y u n 1 the letter b stands for birational 6 pablo pelaez remark 2 5 the base scheme x is noetherian and of finite krull dimension there fore the smooth nisnevich site smx is essentially small i e there exists a small category s equivalent to smx hence the collection of maps b n in s which corre spond to bn form a set since the bousfield localization ofm with respect to b n is identical to the localization with respect to bn we will abuse terminology and simply say that bn is a set now we consider the left bousfield localization ofm with respect to the set of open immersions bn described above definition 2 6 let n 0 be an arbitrary integer 1 let bnm denote the left bousfield localization of m with respect to the set of maps bn 2 let b n u denote its fibrant replacement functor and h bn its associated homotopy category for n 6 0 we will call h bn the codimension n 1 birational motivic homotopy category and for n 0 we will call it the birational motivic homotopy category lemma 2 7 let n 0 be an arbitrary integer then for every a 0 the maps sa bn s a u y u y bn are weak equivalences in bnm proof let u y bn we observe that u y are cofibrant in bnm since they are cofibrant inm by construction u y is a weak equivalence in bnm and 5 thm 4 1 1 4 implies that bnm is a simplicial model category thus it follows from ken brown s lemma see 7 lem 1 1 12 that sa u y is also a weak equivalence in bnm for every a 0 proposition 2 8 let a be an arbitrary simplicial presheaf in m and n 0 an arbitrary integer if a is fibrant in bnm then the following conditions hold 1 a is fibrant in m 2 for every a 0 and every u y bn the induced map homh s a y a u y homh s a u a is an isomorphism proof since the identity functor id m bnm is a left quillen functor the conclusion follows from the derived adjunction id b n u h h bn together with lemma 2 7 now we consider open immersions where the closed complement is smooth definition 2 9 we fix an arbitrary integer n 0 and consider the following set of open immersions with smooth closed complement of codimension at least n 1 wbn u y u y open immersion y z y u smx y irreducible codimy z n 1 the unstable slice filtration 7 remark 2 10 as in remark 2 5 the collection of maps w bn in s which correspond to wbn form a set since the bousfield localization ofm with respect to w bn is identical to the localization with respect to wbn we will abuse terminology and simply say that wbn is a set now we describe the bousfield localizations which will be used for the construc tion of the unstable slice tower definition 2 11 let n 0 be an arbitrary integer 1 let wbnm denote the left bousfield localization ofm with respect to the set of maps wbn 2 let wb n u denote its fibrant replacement functor andh wbn its associated homotopy category for n 6 0 we will call h wbn the codimension n 1 weakly birational motivic homotopy category and for n 0 we will call it the weakly birational motivic homotopy category proposition 2 12 let a be an arbitrary simplicial presheaf in m and n 0 an arbitrary integer if a is fibrant in wbnm then the following conditions hold 1 a is fibrant in m 2 for every a 0 and every u y wbn the induced map homh s a y a u y homh s a u a is an isomorphism proof the proof is exactly the same as in proposition 2 8 proposition 2 13 let n 0 be an arbitrary integer assume that the base scheme x spec k with k a perfect field then the quillen adjunction id id wbnm bnm is a quillen equivalence proof we have the following commutative diagram m id zz id wbnm id bnm where the solid arrows are left quillen functors clearly wbn bn thus every wbn local equivalence is a bn local equivalence therefore the universal property of left bousfield localizations see 5 3 3 19 1 and 3 1 1 1 implies that the horizontal arrow is also a left quillen functor the universal property for left bousfield localizations also implies that it is enough to show that all the maps u y in bn become weak equivalences in wbnm we proceed by induction on the dimension of z y u if dim z 0 then z smx since k is a perfect field and we are considering z with the reduced scheme structure hence u y wbn and then a weak equivalence in wbnm if dim z 0 then we consider the singular locus zs of z over x we have that dim zs dim z since k is a perfect field therefore by induction on the dimension 8 pablo pelaez v y is a weak equivalence in wbnm where v y zs on the other hand u v is also a weak equivalence in wbnm since it is in bn and its closed complement v u z zs is smooth over x by construction of zs but u y v y u v so by the two out of three property for weak equivalences we conclude that u y is a weak equivalence in wbnm theorem 2 14 let n 0 be an arbitrary integer then 1 the following diagram is a tower of left quillen functors m id id uu id id id bn 1 m id bnm id id b 1 m id b 0 m and h id id id id id h bn 1 b n 1 u oo id b n 1 u h bn b n u oo id b n u gg b n 1 u oo id h b 1 b 1 u oo id b 1 u ww h b 0 b 0 u oo b 0 u is the corresponding tower of associated homotopy categories 2 the following diagram is a tower of left quillen functors m idzz id tt id id id wbn 1 m id wbnm id id wb 1 m id wb 0 m and h id id id id id h wbn 1 wb n 1 u oo id wb n 1 u h wbn wb n u oo id wb n u ff wb n 1 u oo id h wb 1 wb 1 u oo id wb 1 u xx h wb 0 wb 0 u oo wb 0 u bb is the corresponding tower of associated homotopy categories proof since the model categories bnm are defined as left bousfield localizations of m with respect to the set of maps bn see definition 2 4 it follows that id m bnm is a left quillen functor on the other hand we observe that bn 1 bn the unstable slice filtration 9 hence every bn 1 local equivalence is also a bn local equivalence and the universal property of left bousfield localizations see 5 3 3 19 1 and 3 1 1 1 implies that id bn 1 m bnm is a left quillen functor finally we observe that the identity functor is a cofibrant replacement functor in m since we are using the injective model structure see 18 thms 2 1 1 2 3 1 and 2 3 2 this proves 1 the proof of 2 is exactly the same 3 the unstable slice filtration in this section we construct the unstable slice functors sn for n 0 as well as their respective liftings s n to the level of quillen model categories lemma 3 1 let 0 j n be arbitrary integers and f a b a map in m which is a weak equivalence in wbnm then f is also a weak equivalence in wbjm proof theorem 2 14 implies that the identity functor id wbnm wbjm is a left quillen functor and by construction both model categories are left bousfield localizations ofm hence by the universal property of left bousfield localizations see 5 3 3 19 1 and 3 1 1 1 it follows that f is also a weak equivalence in wbjm definition 3 2 let n 1 be an arbitrary integer we define inductively the following functors n m m together with natural transformations n id n and n n 1 n as follows 1 1 is just wb 0 u i e the fibrant replacement functor in wb 0 m and 1 is the natural transformation induced by the functorial factorization in wb 0 m of a map into a trivial cofibration followed by a fibration thus every map f a b inm fits in the following commutative diagram a a 1 f 1 a 1 f b b 1 1 b 2 assume that n and n are already defined then given an arbitrary simplicial presheaf a m we factor the natural map a n a na as a trivial cofibration in wbnm followed by a fibration in wbnm a a n 1 a n n 1 a a n na remark 3 3 the functoriality of the factorizations in wbnm implies that n 1 is a functor in m and that n 1 id n 1 n n 1 n are natural transformations 10 pablo pelaez proposition 3 4 let n 0 be an arbitrary integer and a m be an arbitrary simplicial presheaf then 1 the natural map a n 1 a n 1 a is a trivial cofibration in wbnm 2 the natural map for n 1 an n 1 a na is a fibration in wbnm and 1 a is a fibration in wb 0 m 3 the composition n 1 a a n na a n 1 2 a a 1 1 a is a fibration inm and wbnm proof 1 and 2 follow directly from the construction of the functors n and the natural transformations n n in definition 3 2 3 by construction wbnm is a left bousfield localization of m thus the identity functor id wbnm m is a right quillen functor so it is enough to show the result for wbnm for this it suffices to show that 1 a is fibrant in wbnm and that all the maps a n are fibrations in wbnm but this follows from 2 above together with theorem 2 14 corollary 3 5 let n 1 be an arbitrary integer and a m be an arbitrary simplicial presheaf then the natural map an n 1 a na is a weak equivalence in wbn 1 m proof by construction the following diagram commutes a a n a n 1 na n 1 a a n combining lemma 3 1 and proposition 3 4 1 we deduce that the maps a n 1 a n are weak equivalences in wbn 1 m thus by the two out of three property for weak equivalences we conclude that na is a weak equivalence in wbn 1 m definition 3 6 1 let n 1 be an arbitrary integer and a be an arbitrary simplicial presheaf in m consider the natural map in m see definition 3 2 an n 1 a na the unstable slice filtration 11 let s na denote the pullback inm of a n along the base point of na s na i a n n 1 a a n na 3 7 2 if n 0 let s 0 1 proposition 3 8 let n 1 be an arbitrary integer then the construction given in definition 3 6 defines a functor s n m m and a natural transformation in s n n 1 proof it follows immediately from the fact that n is a natural transformation between functors inm and the universal property of pullbacks inm lemma 3 9 let n 1 be an arbitrary integer then 1 the functor see definition 3 2 n m m maps weak equivalences in wbn 1 m to weak equivalences in m 2 the functor see proposition 3 8 s n m m maps weak equivalences in wbnm to weak equivalences in m proof 1 let f a b be a weak equivalence in wbn 1 m we consider the following commutative diagram in wbn 1 m a f a n b b n na n f nb by hypothesis f is a weak equivalence in wbn 1 m on the other hand it fol lows from proposition 3 4 1 that the vertical maps are also weak equivalences in wbn 1 m and the two out of three property for weak equivalences implies that n f is also a weak equivalence in wbn 1 m finally by proposition 3 4 3 na nb are both fibrant in wbn 1 m thus 5 thm 3 2 13 1 and prop 3 4 1 1 implies that n f is a weak equivalence inm 2 let f a b be a weak equivalence in wbnm by construction see definition 3 6 and proposition 3 4 2 the following are fibre sequences in wbnm s na n 1 a a n na s nb n 1 b b n nb 12 pablo pelaez now theorem 2 14 implies that they are also fibre sequences inm on the other hand by naturality f induces a map between these fibre sequences s na s n f n 1 a a n n 1 f na n f s nb n 1 b a n nb combining 1 above with lemma 3 1 we deduce that n 1 f n f are weak equivalences inm thus the result follows from 21 i 3 prop 5 iii corollary 3 10 let n 1 be an arbitrary integer then 1 the functor see definition 3 2 n m m maps weak equivalences in m to weak equivalences in m 2 the functor see proposition 3 8 s n m m maps weak equivalences in m to weak equivalences in m proof let f a b be a weak equivalence in m by lemma 3 9 it suffices to show that for every n 0 f is also a weak equivalence in wbnm but this follows from 5 prop 3 3 3 1 a since wbnm is defined as a left bousfield localization ofm we will write ho m h for the homotopy functor associated to the quillen model categorym proposition 3 11 let n 1 be an arbitrary integer then 1 there exists a unique functor tn h h such that the following diagram commutes m n ho m ho h tn h 2 there exists a unique functor sn h h such that the following diagram commutes m s n ho m ho h sn h the unstable slice filtration 13 proof it follows immediately from corollary 3 10 together with the universal prop erty of the homotopy functor ho for a quillen model category see 21 i 1 defs 5 6 and thm 1 definition 3 12 we will call sn the unstable n slice and s 0 t 1 will be the unstable zero slice proposition 3 13 let a h be an arbitrary simplicial presheaf and n 1 an arbitrary integer then the following is a fibre sequence in h see 21 i 3 def 1 sna i a n tn 1 a a n tna furthermore the map sna is a fibration in wbnm proof by construction see definition 3 6 and proposition 3 4 2 the following diagram is cartesian inm sna i a n tn 1 a a n tna and an is a fibration in wbnm hence we conclude that sna is a fibration in wbnm and that sna tn 1 a tna is a fibre sequence in h wbn on the other hand by theorem 2 14 we deduce that sna tn 1 a tna is also a fibre sequence in h proposition 3 14 let a h be an arbitrary simplicial presheaf and n j 1 arbitrary integers then the maps in the following commutative diagram are isomorphisms in h tja tj a n 1 zz tj a n tj tn 1 a tj a n tj tna proof by lemma 3 9 1 it suffices to show that the maps a n 1 a n and a n are weak equivalences in wbj 1 m but this follows from lemma 3 1 together with proposition 3 4 1 and corollary 3 5 since n j corollary 3 15 let a h be an arbitrary simplicial presheaf and n j 1 arbitrary integers then tja tj tna in h proof this follows directly from proposition 3 14 the

with proposition 3 11 and 3 follows from proposition 3 4 we will call the tower in 2 the unstable slice tower remark 3 17 if the base scheme is of the form x spec k with k a perfect field then an immediate consequence of proposition 2 13 is the fact that all the constructions in this section are canonically isomorphic when they are carried out in the birational motivic categories bnm remark 3 18 notice that all the results in this section and in particular theorem 3 16 hold if we have the following data 1 a model category n which is cellular and left proper 2 for every n 0 a set of maps ln in n such that every weak equivalence in ln 1 n is also a weak equivalence in lnm where ln 1 n resp lnn is the left bousfield localization of n with respect to ln 1 resp ln remark 3 19 in particular if we choose a different quillen model structure m for the category of pointed simplicial presheaves on smx such that m and m are quillen equivalent then all the results in this section hold form as well and the corresponding unstable slice towers of theorem 3 16 2 for m and m are canonically isomorphic 4 the unstable slice spectral sequence in this section we describe the spectral sequence

category of simplicial presheaves with transfers we will write y tr for the simplicial presheaf with transfers represented by y in smx by taking the graph of a morphism in smx we obtain a functor smx cor x this induces a forgetful functor u mtr m which admits a left adjoint ztr m m tr such that ztr y y tr for y smx moreover the adjunction 22 thm 8 and lem 9 ztr u m m tr 5 1 induces a quillen model structure on mtr see definition 5 9 we will abuse no tation and write mtr resp htr for the category of simplicial presheaves with transfers equipped with this particular quillen model structure resp for the asso ciated homotopy category proceeding as in definition 2 6 resp 2 11 we can consider for n 0 the left bousfield localization bnm tr resp wbnm tr of mtr with respect to the set ztr bn resp ztr wbn mimicking the same arguments as in sections 2 and 3 we deduce that bnm tr and wbnm tr are quillen equivalent when the base scheme is a perfect field see proposition 2 13 we obtain towers as in theorems 2 14 3 16 and finally an extended exact couple as in definition 4 1 see remark 3 18 thus we conclude proposition 5 2 given a htr we obtain a corresponding unstable slice tower with transfers which is functorial in htr a a n a n 1 ss a 2 ppp ppp p pp ppp a 1 holim ttrn a a n 1 ttrn 1 a a n ttrn a a n 1 a 2 ttr 2 a a 1 ttr 1 a the unstable slice filtration 17 where ttrn a is fibrant in wbn 1 m tr a n is a weak equivalence in wbn 1 m tr and an resp t tr 1 a is a fibration in wbnm tr resp wb 0 m tr by construction for every n 0 the quillen adjunction ztr u m m tr induces a pair of quillen adjunctions between the corresponding birational motivic homotopy categories ztr u bnm bnm tr ztr u wbnm wbnm tr 5 3 and passing to the associated homotopy categories we obtain the corresponding derived adjunctions ztr b n tr h bn h bn tr ztr wb n tr h wbn h wbn tr 5 4 where b n tr resp wb n tr is a fibrant replacement functor in bnm tr resp wbnm tr remark 5 5 by the work of ro ndigs and stv r 22 h b 0 tr is the natural unstable analogue of the kahn sujatha birational category of motives 2 since the maps in bn and wbn see definitions 2 4 and 2 9 are cofibrations in m and the model structure in mtr is induced by the adjunction 5 1 see definition 5 9 we observe that the quillen model structures bnm tr wbnm tr are induced by the adjunctions 5 3 see 5 prop 3 1 12 and thm 11 3 2 and definition 5 9 thus we conclude proposition 5 6 let f be a map in bnm tr resp wbnm tr then 1 f is a weak equivalence in bnm tr resp wbnm tr if and only if uf is a weak equivalence in bnm resp wbnm 2 f is a fibration in bnm tr resp wbnm tr if and only if uf is a fibration in bnm resp wbnm now we can state the main result of this section theorem 5 7 let a in htr be an arbitrary simplicial presheaf with transfers then 1 the forgetful functor u mtr m induces an isomorphism in h between the unstable slice tower with transfers for a see proposition 5 2 and the corresponding unstable slice tower for u a see theorem 3 16 2 2 for n 0 the unstable slices sn u a of u a admit a canonical structure of simplicial presheaves with transfers proof 1 by the functoriality of the unstable slice tower see theorem 3 16 and lemma 3 9 it suffices to show that for n 0 the maps a n a t tr n a are weak equivalences in wbn 1 m i e after forgetting transfers but this follows from propositions 5 2 and 5 6 18 pablo pelaez 2 the case of the zero slice s 0 t 1 follows from 1 above if n 1 let strn a denote the unstable slice with transfers of a thus by proposition 3 13 the following is a fibre sequence in htr strn a ttrn 1 a a n ttrn a and by 1 above there is a commutative diagram where the rows are fibre sequences in h such that tn u a n tn 1 u a n 1 are isomorphisms in h sn u a tn 1 u a u a n tn 1 u a n 1 tn u a tn u a n u strn a u ttrn 1 a u an u ttrn a hence by 21 i 3 prop 5 iii we conclude that is also an isomorphism in h remark 5 8 the unstable slices sna of an arbitrary simplicial presheaf a h do not admit transfers in general the example of levine 11 2 works as well in the unstable setting and shows that if our base scheme is a field k and c a smooth projective curve of genus g 0 with no rational k points then s 0 zc does not admit transfers where zc is the presheaf of abelian groups represented by c definition 5 9 let f g a b be a quillen adjunction between two quillen model categories a b we say that the quillen model structure on b is induced by the adjunction f g if a map f in b is a weak equivalence resp fibration if and only if g f is a weak equivalence resp fibration in a 6 comparison with the classical postnikov tower in this section the base scheme x will be of the form spec c where c denotes the complex numbers and smx will consist of only smooth quasi projective vari eties we will writem for the category of pointed simplicial presheaves on smx equipped with the quillen model structure defined in 16 thm a 17 which is quillen equivalent 16 rmk a 21 tom by remarks 3 18 and 3 19 all the results in section 3 hold in m and the constructions are canonically isomorphic after we pass to the respective homotopy categories we will write h for the homotopy category associated tom our goal is to study the behavior of the unstable slice filtration see theorem 3 16 2 in the motivic unstable homotopy category h with respect to the functor of c points in smx and compare the unstable slice filtration with the classical postnikov tower of algebraic topology we will write top for the category of pointed compactly generated topologi cal spaces 23 equipped with the model structure constructed by quillen see 21 ch 2 3 thm 1 or 7 thm 2 4 23 and htop for its associated homotopy cate gory notice that top is a simplicial model category 21 ch 2 2 we will write maptop for the corresponding simplicial mapping space 5 1 1 6 for n 1 we will write dn for the unit disc contained in rn and dn top will be the standard inclusion dn 1 d n 1 of the n sphere into the n 1 unit disc both with a disjoint base point consider ln 1 t dn the unstable slice filtration 19 we will write ln 1 top for the left bousfield localization of top with respect to ln 1 t which exists by 5 12 1 4 and theorem 2 1 then mimicking the same arguments as for the unstable slice filtration see remark 3 18 we deduce proposition 6 1 let n 1 be and arbitrary integer then there exist 1 functors pn htop htop 2 natural transformations p n id pn pn pn 1 pn such that for every topological space k top the following tower is func torial in htop k p k n p k n 1 zz ss p k 2 p k 1 holim pn k p k n 1 pn 1 k p k n pn k p k n 1 p k 2 p 2 k p k 1 p 1 k where pn k is fibrant in ln 1 top p k n is a weak equivalence in ln 1 top and pkn resp p 1 k is a fibration in lntop resp l 0 top the work of hirschhorn 5 implies that the tower constructed in proposition 6 1 coincides with the postnikov tower in top theorem 6 2 hirschhorn the tower constructed in proposition 6 1 is the post nikov tower of k top proof hirschhorn constructs the postnikov tower in the context of unpointed topo logical spaces using bousfield localizations with respect to dn 1 dn 1 see 1 5 1 1 5 2 1 5 3 and 1 5 4 in 5 since the maps dn 1 dn 1 are cofi brations and the adjunction between unpointed and pointed topological spaces is enriched in simplicial sets we deduce that a pointed space is local with respect to dn 1 d n 1 if and only if it is local as an unpointed space with respect to dn 1 dn 1 see 5 prop 3 1 12 and thm 11 3 2 this finishes the proof if y smx we will write y c for the set of complex points of y which is a complex analytic manifold hence in particular y c top proposition 6 3 16 the functor cr of complex points is the left adjoint in a quillen adjunction cr sing m top where sing k is the simplicial presheaf y smx 7 maptop y c k proof this follows from 16 thm a 23 now we are ready to establish a connection between our unstable slice filtration and the classical postnikov tower in algebraic topology let bn c be the following set of maps in top bn c cr u y u c y c u y bn 6 4 20 pablo pelaez where we are considering bn as a set of maps in m see definition 2 4 we define bntop to be the left bousfield localization of top with respect to the set bn c which exists by 5 12 1 4 and theorem 2 1 we will write bnhtop for its associated homotopy category then mimicking the same arguments as for the unstable slice filtration see remark 3 18 we deduce proposition 6 5 let n 1 be and arbitrary integer then there exist 1 functors tcn htop htop 2 natural transformations r n id t c n rn t c n 1 t c n such that for every topological space k top the following tower is func torial in htop k rk n rk n 1 ss rk 2 ppp ppp p pp ppp rk 1 holim tcn k rkn 1 tcn 1 k rkn tcn k rkn 1 rk 2 tc 2 k rk 1 tc 1 k where tcn k is fibrant in bn 1 top r k n is a weak equivalence in bn 1 top and rkn resp t c 1 k is a fibration in bntop resp b 0 top remark 6 6 by proposition 2 13 the tower in proposition 6 5 is identical if we replace bn with wbn see definition 2 9 notice that by construction for every n 0 the quillen adjunction see propo sition 6 3 cr sing m top induces a quillen adjunction between the corresponding birational categories cr sing bnm bntop 6 7 and passing to the associated homotopy categories we obtain the corresponding derived adjunction cr b n top h bn bnhtop 6 8 where b n top is a fibrant replacement functor in bntop the main result of this section is the following theorem 6 9 for every n 0 the identity functor id l 2 ntop bntop is a left quillen functor and a quillen equivalence proof we observe that there is a commutative diagram in top d 2 n 2 d 2 n 1 d 2 n 2 cn 1 0 d n cn 1 the unstable slice filtration 21 where the vertical arrows are weak equivalences in top thus by construction the left bousfield localization of top with respect to d 2 n 1 and d n are identical 5 4 1 1 and 4 1 2 on the other hand n a n 1 c 0 a n 1 c is in bn and cr n d n by the universal property of left bousfield localizations see 5 3 3 19 1 and 3 1 1 1 it follows that the identity functor is a left quillen functor using the universal property of left bousfield localizations again we observe that in order to conclude that we have a quillen equivalence it is enough to show that every map in bn c see 6 4 is a weak equivalence in l 2 ntop on the other hand by proposition 2 13 and remark 6 6 it suffices to show that every map in wbn c is a weak equivalence in l 2 ntop but this follows directly from lemma 6 16 corollary 6 10 let k in top be a topological space and n 0 an arbitrary integer then the following are equivalent 1 k is fibrant in l 2 ntop 2 k is fibrant in bntop proof this follows immediately from theorem 6 9 remark 6 11 combining theorems 6 9 and 6 2 we observe that we have obtained an algebro geometric construction of the odd part of the postnikov tower see propo sition 6 1 k p k 2 n 1 p k 2 n 1 rrr rr xxrrrrr p k 3 pk 1 holim p 2 n 1 k p 2 n 1 k p 2 n 1 k p 3 k p 1 k in the rest of this section we will write y for a quasi projective variety in smx with a fixed embedding into projective space i e an open immersion y y and a closed embedding y pn for a suitable n given a map u y in bn and a hyperplaneh in p n we will write e 1 h y y e 2 h u u for the closed embedding of the corresponding hyperplane sections lemma 6 12 let y smx be a smooth irreducible quasi projective variety of dimension d 2 and u y u y a map in bn then there exists a hyperplane h in pn such that in the following commutative diagram h u c cr e 2 cr h u c cr u y h y c cr e 1 y c 1 cr e 1 and cr e 2 are weak equivalences in ld 2 top 2 h y is smooth of dimension d 1 3 if n d 2 then h h u h y is in bn and 4 if n d 1 then h id i e h y u proof by proposition 1 5 2 in 5 in order to prove 1 it suffices to show that cr e 1 resp cr e 2 induces a bijection on the homotopy groups i for i d 2 and for every choice of base point in h y c resp h u c 22 pablo pelaez let z y u be the closed complement of u in y with codimension c in y since u y bn we observe that d c n 1 since y is smooth by the theorem of bertini 9 cor 3 6 there exists a zariski open dense subset of the projective variety p n of hyperplanes in pn such that for every hyperplane h in 2 holds and the codimension of h z in y is c 1 thus we deduce that 3 and 4 also hold for any h in moreover u and y are smooth so by the zariski lefschetz theorem of hamm le 4 thm 1 1 3 we deduce that there exists a hyperplane h in such that y c resp u c has the homotopy type of a space obtained from h y c resp h u c by attaching cells dr dr with r d since all the spaces in the diagram above are cw complexes we deduce by the cellular approximation theorem that cr e 1 and cr e 2 induce a bijection on i for every choice of base point and i r 2 hence we conclude that 1 holds since d 2 r 2 lemma 6 13 let y smx be a smooth irreducible quasi projective variety of dimension d and u y u y a map in bn with n 0 then 1 cr u y 1 u c 1 y c is an isomorphism for every choice of base point in u c proof since the map u y preserves the disjoint point we can assume that the base point is in u c moreover y is irreducible and u is open in y so we deduce that u is also irreducible and in particular u c is path connected hence the result is independent of the choice of base point and we will omit any reference to it in the rest of the proof we proceed by induction on the dimension d of y we observe that d 2 since n 0 let z y u be the closed complement of u in y which has codimension c n 1 in y since u y bn so if d 2 then dimz 0 since n 0 thus z is a disjoint union of closed points since we are assuming that z is reduced we observe that it suffices to consider the case when z consists of only one point since u y can be written as a composition of open immersions where the closed complement consists of only one point if z spec c then there exists a pushout square of open immersions in top of the form d 4 0 d 4 u c cr u y y c by the theorem of van kampen we deduce that 1 cr u y is equal to 1 u c colim 1 d 4 0 1 d 4 1 u c 1 u c which is an isomorphism so the claim holds in this case the unstable slice filtration 23 if d 3 then by lemma 6 12 there exists a hyperplane h in pn such that in the following commutative diagram h u c cr e 2 cr h u c cr u y h y c cr e 1 y c cr e 1 and cr e 2 are weak equivalences in ld 2 top we observe that d 2 3 2 1 so proposition 1 5 2 in 5 impies that cr e 1 and cr e 2 induce a bijection on the corresponding fundamental groups 1 if n d 1 then by lemma 6 12 4 cr h is the identity map so we conclude that cr u y induces an isomorphism on 1 on the other hand if n d 2 then by 2 3 in lemma 6 12 we deduce that h bn and h y is smooth of dimension d 1 thus by induction on the dimension we conclude that cr h induces an isomorphism on 1 hence it follows that cr u y also induces an isomorphism on 1 as we wanted recall that a topological space a top is simply connected if it is path con nected i e 0 a and 1 a for every choice of base point in a lemma 6 14 let w w be a closed embedding of real codimension r 2 be tween real smooth manifolds assume that w and u w w are simply connected then the open immersion u w is a weak equivalence in lr 2 top proof by proposition 1 5 2 in 5 it suffices to show that induces a bijection on the homotopy groups i for i r 2 and for every choice of base point in u since u and w are simply connected by whitehead s theorem it suffices to show that the induced map hi on singular homology with integral coefficients is an isomorphism for 0 i r 2 and an epimorphism for i r 1 see 29 thm 4 28 p 181 thm 7 13 but this is equivalent to hi w u for every i r 1 where we write w u for the homotopy cofibre of now by excision and the tubular neighborhood theorem cf 12 p 117 cor 11 2 hi w u hi th nw w where th nw w is the thom space of the normal bundle of the closed embed ding w w see definition 7 18 since singular homology satisfies the mayer vietoris property it suffices to consider the case when nw w is trivial in this case th nw w is homotopy equivalent to s r w since nw w is a vector bundle of rank r over w thus we conclude that for i r 1 hi th nw w hi s r w as we wanted 24 pablo pelaez corollary 6 15 let v v be a closed embedding of complex codimension c 1 between analytic manifolds assume that v and u v v are simply connected then the open immersion u v is a weak equivalence in l 2 c 2 top proof this follows from lemma 6 14 taking r 2 c lemma 6 16 let y smx be a smooth irreducible quasi projective variety of dimension d and u y u y a map in wbn then cr u y u c y c is a weak equivalence in l 2 ntop proof by proposition 1 5 2 in 5 it suffices to show that cr u y induces a bi jection on the homotopy groups i for i 2 n and for every choice of base point in u c since the map u y preserves the disjoint point we can assume that the base point is in u c moreover y is irreducible and u is open in y so we deduce that u is also irreducible and in particular u c is path connected hence the result is independent of the choice of base point and we will omit any reference to it in the rest of the proof if n 0 then it is enough to see that cr u y induces a bijection on 0 but this is clear since y is irreducible now we assume that n 0 so d 2 by lemma 6 13 cr u y induces a bijection on the fundamental groups 1 hence it only remains to check that i cr u y is an isomorphism for 2 i 2 n let y c be the universal covering space of y c and consider the following cartesian square of topological spaces p 1 y u c pu cr u y y c py u c cr u y y c notice that y c has the structure of an analytic manifold where py is a local ana lytic isomorphism since y c is smooth we deduce that y c is irreducible as an analytic manifold thus p 1 y u c is irreducible and in particular path connected since it is the open complement of the closed analytic submanifold p 1 y z c of y c where z y u hence pu is a covering map we claim that p 1 y u c is the universal covering space of u c in effect it suffices to show that 1 p 1 y u c now we observe that 1 pu is injective since pu is a covering and by lemma 6 13 1 cr u y is an isomorphism thus by the commutativity of the diagram above we conclude that 1 py 1 cr u y is also injective but this map is trivial since it factors through 1 y c thus 1 p 1 y u c as we wanted hence in order to show that i cr u y is an isomorphism for 2 i 2 n it suffices to show that i cr u y is an isomorphism for 2 i 2 n but this the unstable slice filtration 25 follows directly from corollary 6 15 and 5 prop 1 5 2 since cr u y is an open immersion between analytic manifolds with smooth closed complement p 1 y z c of complex codimension n 1 7 some computations in this section we study the behavior of unstable and stable slices with respect to the quillen adjunction between the category of pointed simplicial presheaves on smx and the category of symmetric t spectra onm t ev 0 m spt m 7 1 we also carry out some computations of unstable slices using a method similar to 19 4 definition 7 2 let a in h be a pointed simplicial presheaf on smx and n 0 an arbitrary integer we will say that a is an n slice if a sna in h i e the maps a n 1 and i a n in the following diagram are isomorphisms in h a a n 1 sna i a n tn 1 a a n tna recall that the functors tn h h were defined in proposition 3 11 lemma 7 3 let n 0 be an arbitrary integer and f a b be a map in m which is a weak equivalence in wbnm then for every integer 1 j n 1 tj f is an isomorphism in h proof by lemma 3 1 we deduce that f is a weak equivalence in wbj 1 m by lemma 3 9 1 we conclude that j f is a weak equivalence in m hence the result follows from proposition 3 11 1 lemma 7 4 let n 1 be an arbitrary integer and f a b be a map in h such that tn 1 f and tn f are isomorphisms in h then the unstable n slice of f sn f is also an isomorphism in h proof it follows from proposition 3 13 that the rows in the following commutative diagram are fibre sequences in h sn a sn f tn 1 a tn 1 f tn a tn f sn b tn 1 b tn b thus by 21 i 3 prop 5 iii we conclude that sn f is also an isomorphism in h theorem 7 5 let a in h and n 0 then a is an n slice see definition 7 2 if and only if the following conditions hold 1 tja is an isomorphism in h for every 1 j n 2 the natural map a n 1 a tn 1 a is an isomorphism in h see theorem 3 16 26 pablo pelaez proof assume that a is an n slice thus the maps a n 1 i a n in the dia gram below are isomorphisms in h see definition 7 2 thus the map an is null homotopic in h i e it factors through since the horizontal row in the following diagram is a fibre sequence in h by proposition 3 13 a a n 1 sna i a n tn 1 a a n tna hence the following diagram in h commutes tn 1 a a n tna oo applying the functor tj we obtain the following commutative diagram in h tja tj tn 1 a tj a n tj tna tja tj oo where tja tj tn 1 a and tj tna tja are isomorphic in h by corollary 3 15 now proposition 3 14 implies that tj a n is an isomorphism in h since n j thus we conclude that tja is a retract of in h so tja in h assume that 1 and 2 hold then by proposition 3 13 we deduce that sna tn 1 a a in h now we will study the relation between the stable slice filtration see theo rems 1 5 1 8 and its unstable analogue see theorem 3 16 consider the infinite suspension of the set of maps described in definition 2 9 t wbn t u y u y u y open immersion 7 6 y z y u smx y irreducible codimy z n 1 proposition 7 7 let n 0 be an arbitrary integer in the following commutative diagram all the arrows are left quillen functors m t id spt m id wbnm t wbnspt m proof it is clear that the diagram commutes and that the top horizontal arrow is a left quillen functor the vertical arrows are left quillen functors since by construction wbnm resp wbnspt m is a left bousfield localization of m resp spt m now we observe that all the maps in 7 6 are contained in 1 7 hence we deduce that all the maps in 7 6 are weak equivalences in wbnspt m since by the unstable slice filtration 27 construction it is the left bousfield localization of spt m with respect to the maps in 1 7 finally by the universal property of left bousfield localizations see 5 3 3 19 1 and 3 1 1 1 we conclude that the bottom horizontal arrow is also a left quillen functor we will write sh wbn for the homotopy category of wbnspt m and t t h sh for the derived adjunction of 7 1 let e spt m be an arbitrary symmetric t spectrum and n 0 an arbitrary integer consider the functors sn sh sh s n 1 sh sh as defined in theorem 1 5 proposition 7 8 t sne and t s n 1 e are fibrant in wbnm proof by theorems 1 5 2 1 8 resp 1 5 2 3 1 8 we can assume that t s n 1 e resp t sne is fibrant in wbnspt m hence the result follows from proposi tion 7 7 on the other hand combining 1 2 with theorems 1 5 2 1 8 we deduce that fn 1 e e s n 1 e is a fibre sequence and a distinguished triangle in sh wbn and sh similarly combining 1 4 with theorems 1 5 2 3 1 8 we deduce that sne s n 1 e s ne is a fibre sequence and a distinguished triangle in sh wbn and sh therefore by proposition 7 7 we conclude proposition 7 9 let e spt m be an arbitrary symmetric t spectrum and n 0 an arbitrary integer then the following are fibre sequences in h wbn and h t fn 1 e t e t s n 1 e t sne t s n 1 e t s ne by looking at propositions 7 8 and 7 9 it is natural to ask if t sne is an unstable n slice see definition 7 2 if n 0 then by theorem 7 5 we conclude that t s 0 e is an unstable zero slice however if n 1 then t sne is not an unstable n slice in general example 7 10 let the base scheme x spec k with k a perfect field and 3 a prime different from the characteristic of k consider the spectrum h which represents in sh motivic cohomology with z coefficients 25 6 1 then t s 1 s 2 g 1 m h is not an unstable 1 slice in effect guillou and weibel construct a non trivial map in h taking r 1 in 3 ex 8 1 and using the grading for motivic cohomology introduced in 25 6 p 595 v t s 2 g 1 m h t gm h 28 pablo pelaez on the other hand by the work of levine 10 lem 10 4 1 s 0 h h in sh thus we conclude that in sh s 1 s 2 g 1 m h s 2 g 1 m h s 1 gm h gm h now by theorem 3 16 3 t s 1 s 2 g 1 m h 2 t s 1 s 2 g 1 m h t 2 t s 1 s 2 g 1 m h is a weak equivalence in wb 1 m combining the adjunctions in theorem 2 14 2 with the fact that t s 1 gm h t gm h is fibrant in wb 1 m by proposition 7 8 and the non triviality of v we deduce that t 2 t s 1 s 2 g 1 m h is not an isomorphism inh hence by theorem 7 5 1 it follows that t s 1 s 2 g 1 m h is not an unstable 1 slice remark 7 11 from example 7 10 we observe that the unstable slices are non trivial and finer invariants than the corresponding stable slices now we proceed to describe some computations of unstable slices remark 7 12 see remark 6 11 the following result is an unstable motivic ana logue of the standard result in topology i s 2 n for i 2 n 1 i e the topological connectivity of the spheres we will write t r for sr grm where r 0 is an integer theorem 7 13 let r 1 1 m r 0 n r 1 be arbitrary integers then 1 for every z smx the natural map tm t r z is an isomorphism in h 2 for every z smx the natural map sn t r z is an isomorphism in h proof by lemma 7 4 and the definition of the zero slice see definition 3 12 it is enough to prove 1 we claim that the natural map t r z is a weak equivalence in wbr 1 m in effect 13 prop 2 17 2 implies that the following diagram is a cofibre sequence inm arz z r z arz t r z 7 14 where z is embedded in arz via the zero section now the identity functor id m wbr 1 m is a left quillen functor since wbr 1 m is a left bousfield localization ofm hence diagram 7 14 is also a cofibre sequence in wbr 1 m therefore by the dual of 21 i 3 prop 5 iii it is enough to show that r z is a weak equivalence in wbr 1 m but this follows from the definition of wbr 1 m see definition 2 11 since the codimension of the closed complement of the open immersion r z is r finally the result follows from lemma 7 3 given y smx let p n y denote the trivial projective bundle of rank n over y consider the following filtered diagram inm 7 15 p 0 y p 1 y pn y the unstable slice filtration 29 given by the inclusions of the respective hyperplanes at infinity remark 7 16 see remark 6 11 the following result is an unstable motivic ana logue of the standard result in topology i p n c i p n 1 c for i 2 n theorem 7 17 1 for any integer 1 j n 1 the diagram 7 15 induces the following isomorphisms in h tj p n y tj p n 1 y tj p n m y 2 for any integer 0 j n the diagram 7 15 induces the following iso morphisms in h sj p n y sj p n 1 y sj p n m y proof by lemma 7 4 and the definition of the zero slice see definition 3 12 it is enough to prove 1 let k n and consider the closed embedding induced by the diagram 7 15 kn p n y pk y it is possible to choose a linear embedding pk n 1 y pk y such that its open complement uk n contains p n y embedded via the zero section kn and has the structure of a vector bundle over p n y uk n v k n pk y pk n 1 y oo pn y k n oo k n gg by homotopy invariance tj k n is an isomorphism in h for every integer j on the other hand vkn is a weak equivalence in wbnm since the codimension of its closed complement is n 1 see definition 2 11 thus lemma 7 3 implies that if 1 j n 1 then tj v k n is also an

bundle v y with y smx let th v denote the thom space of v i e the pushout of the following diagram inm v 0 y v x th v where 0 y v is the zero section of v remark 7 19 see remark 6 11 the following result is an unstable motivic ana logue of the standard result in topology if is a complex vector bundle of rank r over a cw complex then k th for k 2 r 1 see 12 p 205 lem 18 1 theorem 7 20 let n 0 0 j n 1 k n 1 be arbitrary integers and let u y wbn with closed complement z then 1 the natural map tk th ny z is an isomorphism in h 2 the natural map sj th ny z is an isomorphism in h 30 pablo pelaez proof by lemma 7 4 and the definition of the zero slice see definition 3 12 it is enough to prove 1 now it follows from the morel voevodsky homotopy purity theorem see 13 thm 2 23 that the following diagram is a cofibre sequence inm u u y y th ny z and theorem 2 14 implies that the diagram above is also a cofibre sequence in wbnm but u y is a weak equivalence in wbnm since it is defined as a left bousfield localization ofm with respect to wbn hence the dual of 21 i 3 prop 5 iii implies that the map th ny z is a weak equivalence in wbnm and the result then follows from lemma 7 3 remark 7 21 see remark 6 11 the following result is an unstable motivic ana logue of the standard result in topology if is a complex vector bundle of rank r over a cw complex x then th has a cell decompostion given by the base point and n 2 r cells which are in bijection with the n cells of x for n 0 see 12 p 205 lem 18 1 in the case u y the following result is due to morel voevodsky see proposi tion 2 17 2 in 13 and this particular case is an ingredient in our proof theorem 7 22 let n 0 0 j n 1 k n 1 be arbitrary integers and let u y wbn consider a vector bundle v y of rank r together with a trivialization 1 u aru of its restriction to u then 1 there exists an isomorphism in h tk th v tk s r grm y 2 there exists an isomorphism in h sj th v sj s r grm y proof let z smx be the closed complement of u y consider the following diagram in smx where all the squares are cartesian 1 z v 0 y v 0 y 1 u v 0 y oo 1 z v 1 u oo z y u u y oo and let th 1 u th v be the induced map between the corresponding thom spaces we observe that also belong to wbn thus are weak equivalences in wbnm see definition 2 11 we claim that th 1 u th v the unstable slice filtration 31 is also a weak equivalence inwbnm in effect by construction of the thom spaces we deduce that the rows in the following commutative diagram are in fact cofibre sequences inm 1 u v 0 y 1 u th 1 u v 0 y v th v but theorem 2 14 implies that these rows are also cofibre sequences in wbnm since are weak equivalences in wbnm it follows from the dual of 21 i 3 prop 5 iii that is also a weak equivalence in wbnm now we use the trivialization to obtain the following commutative diagram in smx where the rows are isomorphisms aru u 1 u v 0 y oo aru 1 u u ww oo u the same argument as above shows that there is a weak equivalence in wbnm th 1 u th aru on the other hand 13 prop 2 17 2 implies that there is a weak equivalence w th aru s r grm u inm since wbnm is a left bousfield localization of m it follows from 5 prop 3 3 3 1 a that w is also a weak equivalence in wbnm moreover by construction u y is a weak equivalence in wbnm see definition 2 11 since we are assuming that u y wbn and ken brown s lemma see 7 lem 1 1 12 implies that sr grm u y is also a weak equivalence in wbnm thus all the maps in the following diagram are weak equivalences in wbnm th 1 u th aru w sr grm u s r g r m u y th v sr grm y finally the result follows from lemmas 7 3 and 7 4 corollary 7 23 assume that the base scheme x spec k with k a perfect field let n 0 0 j n 1 k n 1 be arbitrary integers and let u y bn consider a vector bundle v y of rank r together with a trivialization 1 u aru of its restriction to u then 1 there exists an isomorphism in h tk th v tk s r grm y 32 pablo pelaez 2 there exists an isomorphism in h sj th v sj s r grm y proof by proposition 2 13 we can use the same argument as in theorem 7 22 to prove the result given a closed embedding z y of smooth schemes over x let b zy denote the blowup of y with center in z remark 7 24 see remark 6 11 combining theorems 6 9 and 6 2 with the proof of theorem 7 25 we obtain the following result in the classical topological setting which although not surprising it appears not to be in the literature let z y be a closed embedding of smooth quasiprojective complex algebraic varieties and let b zy denote the blowup of y with center in z then the k skeleton of y is a retract of the k skeleton of b zy where k is the codimension of z in y theorem 7 25 let n 1 0 j n 1 k n 1 be arbitrary integers and let u y wbn with closed complement z consider the following cartesian square in smx 7 26 d q d b zy p u uoo z i y u u y oo then 1 t 1 u s 0 u is an isomorphism in h 2 tk u y is an isomorphism in h and the following diagram commutes b zy tk p y r k y 7 27 where r k tk u tk u y 1 3 sj u y is an isomorphism in h and the following diagram commutes b zy sj p y rj y 7 28 where rj sj u sj u y 1 proof 1 we observe that u wb 0 see definition 2 9 thus u is a weak equivalence in wb 0 m see definition 2 11 and the result follows from lemma 7 3 2 we observe that u y is a weak equivalence in wbnm see definition 2 11 then lemma 7 3 implies that tk u y is an isomorphism in h thus r k is well defined and by functoriality the diagram 7 27 commutes in h 3 the result follows from 2 above together with lemma 7 4 and the definition of the zero slice see definition 3 12 the unstable slice filtration 33 acknowledgements the author would like to thank marc levine for bringing to his attention the connection between slices and birational cohomology theories and chuck weibel for pointing
