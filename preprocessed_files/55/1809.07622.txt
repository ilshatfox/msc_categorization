equivalence for the quasi theory qe n g corresponding to certain cohomol ogy theories e the construction of the orthogonal g spectrum for quasi elliptic cohomology can be applied to the constructions for quasi theories 1 introduction in 6 we construct a functor q from the category of orthogonal ring spectra to the category of ig fsp if e is a global cohomology theory q e weakly represents the cohomology theory 1 1 qe g x gtors conj e x gtors e x g the image of global k spectrum is a ig fsp representing quasi elliptic cohomol ogy up to a weak equivalence quasi elliptic cohomology is a variant of elliptic cohomology theories which is the generalized elliptic cohomology theory associated to the tate curve tate q over specz q section 2 6 1 quasi elliptic cohomology is defined over specz q inverting q allows us to define a sufficiently non naive equivariant cohomology the ory and to interpret some constructions more easily its relation with tate k theory is 1 2 qell g x z q z q k tate g x motivated by quasi elliptic cohomology we construct quasi theories qe n g in 9 quasi elliptic cohomology the theories qe g defined in 1 1 and the generalized quasi elliptic cohomology in example 2 4 are all special cases of quasi theories in this paper we show that the idea of constructing the functor q can be applied to construct a family of functors qn from the category of orthogonal ring spectra to the category of ig fsp especially the functor q 1 is q in other words we construct a ig fsp representing qe n g up to weak equivalence for each positive integer n and each compact lie group g in this paper we show the construction of functors qn the idea is analogous to the construction of q in 6 for the readers convenience we still include all 2010 mathematics subject classification primary 55 1 http arxiv org abs 1809 07622 v 1 2 zhen huan the details in this paper in section 2 we recall the definition and examples of quasi theories in section 3 we recall a category of orthogonal g spectra intro duced in 6 in section 4 we construct a space qeg n m representing the m th g equivariant quasi theory qemn g up to a weak equivalence in section 5 we construct a ig fsp representing qe n g up to weak equivalence for certain co homology theories e and construct the functors qn in the appendix we construct some faithful group representations needed in the construction of the ig fsp 1 1 acknowledgement i would like to thank my phd advisor charles rezk under his direction i constructed equivariant orthogonal spectra for quasi elliptic cohomology which is a special case of quasi theories in addition he sug gested the project on quasi theories to me i would like to thank matthew ando for encouraging me to finish the projects 2 the quasi theory qe n g in this section we recall the quasi theories the main reference for that is 9 let g be a compact lie group and n denote a positive integer let gtorsconj denote a set of representatives of g conjugacy classes in the set gtors of torsion elements in g let gnz denote set 1 2 n i g tors conj i j is the identity element in g let 1 2 n g n z define cg n i 1 cg i 2 1 g cg r n 1 e 1 2 e 2 n en 2 2 where cg i is the centralizer of each i in g and e 1 e 2 en is a basis of r n let q t u 1 denote the representation t 7 e 2 it let qi 1 q 1 tn u 1 denote the tensor product with q at the i th position and trivial representations at other position the representation ring r tn r t n z q 1 q n we have the exact sequence 2 3 1 cg g tn 0 where the first map is g 7 g 0 and the second map is g t 1 tn e 2 it 1 e 2 itn then the map r tn r g equips the representation ring r g the structure as an r tn module this is lemma 3 1 9 presenting the relation between rcg and r g lemma 2 1 r tn r g exhibits r g as a free r t n module there is an r tn basis of r g given by irreducible representations v such that restriction v 7 v cg to cg defines a bijection between v and the set of irreducible representations of cg definition 2 2 for equivariant cohomology theories e h h and anyg space x the corresponding quasi theory qe n g x is defined to be gn z e g x quasi theories and their equivariant orthogonal spectra 3 example 2 3 motivating example tate k theory and quasi elliptic cohomol ogy tate k theory is the generalized elliptic cohomology associated to the tate curve the elliptic cohomology theories form a sheaf of cohomology theories over the moduli stack of elliptic curves mell tate k theory over specz q is obtained when we restrict it to a punctured completed neighborhood of the cusp at i e the tate curve tate q over specz q section 2 6 1 the divisible group as sociated to tate k theory is gm q z the relation between tate k theory and string theory is better understood than most known elliptic cohomology theories in addition tate k theory has the closest ties to witten s original insight that the elliptic cohomology of a space x is related to the t equivariant k theory of the free loop space lx c s 1 x with the circle t acting on lx by rotating loops ganter gave a careful interpretation in section 2 5 of this statement that the definition of g equivariant tate k theory for finite groups g is modelled on the loop space of a global quotient orbifold other than the theory over specz q we can define variants of tate k theory over specz q and specz q respectively the theory over specz q is of especial interest inverting q allows us to define a sufficiently non naive equivariant cohomol ogy theory and to interpret some constructions more easily in terms of extensions of groups over the circle the resulting cohomology theory is called quasi elliptic cohomology 12 7 8 its relation with tate k theory is 2 4 qell g x z q z q k tate g x which also reflects the geometric nature of the tate curve qell t pt has a direct interpretation in terms of the katz mazur group scheme t section 8 7 10 the idea of quasi elliptic cohomology is motivated by ganter s construction of tate k theory 3 it is not an elliptic cohomology but a more robust and algebraically simpler treatment of tate k theory this new theory can be interpreted in a neat form by equivariant k theories some formulations in it can be generalized to equivariant cohomology theories other than tate k theory quasi elliptic cohomology qell g is exactly the quasi theory qk 1 g in definition 2 2 example 2 4 generalized tate k theory and generalized quasi elliptic coho mology in section 2 5 ganter gave an interpretation of g equivariant tate k theory for finite groups g by the loop space of a global quotient orbifold apply the loop construction n times we can get the n th generalized tate k theory the divisible group associated to it is gm q z n with quasi theories we can get a neat expression of it consider the quasi theory qk n g x gnz k g x qk n g x z q n z q n is isomorphic to the n th generalized tate k theory 3 a new category of orthogonal g spectra it is difficult to construct a concrete representing spectrum for elliptic coho mology in section 4 6 we formulate a new category of spectra with larger class of weak equivalence than that in 11 in section 6 6 we construct an orthogo nal g spectrum for any compact lie group g representing qell g in this new category of orthogonal g spectra 4 zhen huan first we recall the category of orthogonal g spectra in 11 and the category gws that we will work in the weak equivalence of interest is the isomorphism definition 3 1 for subgroups h of g and integers q define the homotopy groups hq x of a g prepsectrum x by 3 1 hq x colimv h q v x v if q 0 where v runs over the indexing g spaces in the chosen universe and 3 2 h q x colimv rq h 0 v rqx v if q 0 a map f x y of g prespectra is a isomorphism if it induces iso morphisms on all homotopy groups a map of orthogonal g spectra is a isomorphism if its underlying map of g prespectra is a isomorphism definition 3 2 the category gws is the homotopy category of the category of orthogonal g spectra with the weak equivalence defined by 3 3 x y if h 0 x v h 0 y v for each faithful g representation v and any closed subgroup h of g an orthogonal g spectrum x in gws is said to represent a theory h g if we have a natural map 3 4 h 0 x v h v g g h for each faithful g representation v and any closed subgroup h of g lemma 3 3 if a map f x y of orthogonal g spectra induces isomor phisms 3 3 on the homotopy groups i e 3 5 f h 0 x v h 0 y v for each faithful g representation v and any closed subgroup h of g then f is a isomorphism we will work in the homotopy category of the category of orthogonalg spectra with the weak equivalence defined in 3 5 this homotopy categorygwt is smaller than the homotopy category of orthogonalg spectra that we usually talked about where the weak equivalence involved is the isomorphism however it seems the information that each object contains is enough to define an equivariant cohomology theory the homotopical adjunction below is a way to describe the relation between g equivariant homotopy theory and those equivariant homotopy theory for its closed subgroups it is introduced in definition 4 4 6 definition 3 4 homotopical adjunction let h and g be two compact lie groups let 3 6 l gt ht and r ht gt be two functors between the category of g spaces and that of h spaces a left to right homotopical adjunction is a natural map 3 7 maph lx y mapg x ry which is a weak equivalence of spaces when x is a g cw complex quasi theories and their equivariant orthogonal spectra 5 analogously a right to left homotopical adjunction is a natural map 3 8 mapg x ry maph lx y which is a weak equivalence of spaces when x is a g cw complex l is called a homotopical left adjoint and r a homotopical right adjoint 4 equivariant spectra in this section we construct a spaceqeg n m representing them thg equivariant quasi theory qemn g up to a weak equivalence let g be a compact lie group and gnz let denote the subgroup 1 n of g let sg map g ke k where denotes the join k goes over all the maximal subgroups of and e k is the universal space of the abelian group k lemma 4 1 for any closed subgroup h 6 g sg satisfies 4 1 shg pt if for any b g b 1 b h if there exists b g such that b 1 b 6 h proof 4 2 shg map g h ke k if there exists an b g such that b 1 b 6 h it is equivalent to that there exists points in g h that can be fixed by but there are no points in ke k that can be fixed by the whole group so there is no equivariant map from g h to ke k in this case s h g is empty if for any b g b 1 b h it is equivalent to say that there are no points in g h that can be fixed by any proper subgroup l of is contained in some maximal subgroup of ke k l is the join of several contractible spaces e k l thus it is contractible so all the homotopy groups n ke k l are trivial for any n 1 and any l equivariant map f g h n ke k from the n skeleton of g h the obstruction cocycle is zero then by equivariant obstruction theory f can be extended to the n 1 cells of g h and any two extensions f and f are homotopic so in this case shg is contractible theorem 4 2 a homotopical right adjoint of the functor l gt cg t x 7 x from the category of g spaces to that of cg spaces is 4 3 rg cg t gt y 7 mapcg g y scg proof let h be any closed subgroup of g first we show given a cg equivariant map f g h y it extends uniquely up to cg homotopy to a cg equivariant map f g h y scg 6 zhen huan f can be viewed as a map g h y scg by composing with the inclusion of one end of the join y y scg y 7 1 y 0 if bh g h define f bh f bh if bh is not in g h its stabilizer group does not contain by lemma 4 1 for any subgroup l of its stabilizer group sl cg is contractible so y scg l y l sl cg is contractible in other words if l occurs as the isotropy subgroup of a point outside g h n y scg l is trivial by equivariant obstruction theory f can extend to a cg equivariant map f g h y scg and any two extensions are cg homotopy equivalent in addition s cg is empty so the image of the restriction of any map g h y scg to the subspace g h is contained in the end y of the join thus mapcg g h y is weak equivalent to mapcg g h y scg moreover we have the equivalence by adjunciton 4 4 mapg g h mapcg g y scg mapcg g h y scg so we get 4 5 r y h mapg g h r y mapcg g h y letx be of the homotopy type of ag cw complex letxk denote the k skeleton of x consider the functors mapg r y and mapcg y from gt to t both of them sends homotopy colimit to homotopy limit in addition we have a natural map from mapg r y to mapcg y by sending a g map f x r y to the composition 4 6 x f r y y y with the second map f 7 f e note that for any f r y i 1 n f e i f e f e i f i i f e so f e y scg y and the second map is well defined it gives weak equivalence on orbits as shown in 4 5 thus r is a homotopical right adjoint of l the subgroup 1 t g t r n of g is isomorphic to r n we use the same symbol rn to denote it theorem 4 3 let y be a g space consider the functor l gt g t x 7 x where g acts on x by g t x gx the functor r g t gt with 4 7 r y mapcg g y r n scg is a homotopical right adjoint of l proof let x be a g space let h be any closed subgroup of g for any g space x rn acts trivially on x thus the image of any g equivariant map x y is in y r n so we have map g x y mapcg x y r n first we show f g h y r n extends uniquely up to cg homotopy to a cg equivariant map f g h y r n scg f can be viewed as a quasi theories and their equivariant orthogonal spectra 7 map g h y r n scg by composing with the inclusion as the end of the join y r n y r n scg y 7 1 y 0 the rest of the proof is analogous to that of theorem 4 2 theorem 4 3 implies theorem 4 4 directly theorem 4 4 for any compact lie group g and any integer n and m let eg n m denote the space representing the m th g equivariant en theory then the theory qemn g is weakly represented by the space qeg n m gnz r e g n m in the sense of 4 8 4 8 0 qeg n m qe m n g s 0 where r e g n m is the space mapcg g e r n g n m scg 5 orthogonal g spectrum of qe n g in this section we consider equivariant cohomology theories e g that have the same key features as equivariant complex k theories more explicitly the theories e g g have the change of group isomorphism i e for any closed subgroup h of g and h space x the change of group map gh e g g h x e h x defined by e g g h x e h g h x i e h x is an isomorphism where is the restriction map and i x g h x is the h equivariant map defined by i x e x there exists an orthogonal spectrum e such that for any compact lie group

representation for every ample g representation w the adjoint structure map ev w e v map sw e v w is a g weak equivalence in this section we construct a ig fsp qen g qen qen representing the theory qe n g in the category gws defined in definition 3 2 5 1 the construction of qen g 5 1 1 the construction of s g v in this section for each g n z we construct an orthogonal version s g v sym v sym v of the space sg it is the space classified by the condition 5 1 which is also the condition classifying sg let v be a real g representation let symn v denote the n th symmetric power v n which has an evident g n action on it let sym v n 0 symn v if v is an ample g representation sym v is a faithful h representation thus a complete h universe 8 zhen huan define 5 1 s g v sym v sym v n i 1 sym v sym v i the complex conjugation on v induces an involution on it note that for any subgroup h of g containing 1 n s h v has the same underlying space as s g v proposition 5 1 let v be an orthogonal g representation for any closed subgroup h 6 cg s g v satisfies 5 2 s g v h pt if h if 6 h proof if 6 h sym v h is a subspace of sym v so sym v sym v h is empty to simplify the symbol we use symn denote the orthogonal comple ment of symn v in symn v sym v sym v h colimn sym n v h symn h 0 then symn h 0 skn 1 where kn is the dimension of sym n h as n goes to infinity kn goes to infinity when kn is large enough s kn 1 is contractible so sym v sym v h is contractible 5 1 2 the construction of f g v next we construct a space f g v rep resenting the theory ev g if v is a faithful g representation by proposition a 6 we have the faithful g representation v r in addition v can be considered as a g representation with trivial r action the space e v r v represents e v r v g so we have map s v r e v r v represents ev g since x map s v r e v r v g is isomorphic to x s v r e v r v g e v r v g x s v r ev g x to simplify the symbol we use f g v to denote the space map r s v r e v r v its basepoint c 0 is the constant map to the basepoint of e v r v f g v 7 f g v provides a functor from ig to the category cg t of cg spaces it has the properties below proposition 5 2 let g and h be compact lie groups let v be a real g representation and w a real h representation let gnz h n z i we have the unit map g v s v f g v and the multiplication f g v h w f g v f h w f g h v w quasi theories and their equivariant orthogonal spectra 9 making the unit associativity and centrality of unit diagram commute and g v is cg equivariant and f g v h w is cg h equi variant ii let g denote the diagonal map g g g g 7 g g let g v w f g v map s w f g v w denote the map x 7 w 7 g f g v g w x g w w then g v w is a g weak equivalence when v is an ampleg representation iii if e e e is commutative we have 5 3 f g v h w x y f h w g v y x for any x f g v and y f h w the proof is straightforward and left to the readers 5 1 3 the construction of qen g v recall in theorem 4 4 we construct a g space qeg n m representing qe m n g in this section we go a step further apply theorem 4 3 we get the conclusion below proposition 5 3 let v be a faithful orthogonal g representation let b n g v denote the space gnz mapcg g f g v s g v qevn g is weakly represented byb n g v in the sense 0 b n g v qe v n g s 0 the proof of proposition 5 3 is analogous to that of theorem 4 4 step by step below is the main

any t 1 a t 2 b f g v s g v define 5 5 h t 1 a t 2 b t t 1 a t 2 1 t b t min b t 2 b b then we show qe n g v is g weak equivalent to qen g v let q qe n g v qen g v be the quotient map let h be a closed subgroup of cg if the group is in h since s g v h is empty so qen g v h is in the end f g v and can be identified with f g v h in this case qh is the identity map if is not in h qe n g v h is contractible the cone c 0 s g v h is contractible so q c 0 s g v h q c 0 s g v h is contractible note that the subspace of all the points of the form t 1 c 0 t 2 b for any t 1 and b is q c 0 s g v h therefore qen g v h qe n g v h q c 0 s g v h is contractible therefore qe g v is g weak equivalent to f g v s g v proposition 5 5 let gnz let y be a based g space let y denote the cg space t 1 a t 2 b

be an element in the underlying vector space v on v a t v e 2 it m 1 l 1 m n ln a v v and on v cq 1 a t v e 2 it m 1 l 1 m n ln 2 it a v v so we get e 2 it v v thus t 0 cg acts faithfully on v so it acts faithfully on v v cq 1 since a 0 w w for any w v v cq 1 so a e thus v v c q 1 is a faithful g representation quasi theories and their equivariant orthogonal spectra 15 ii note that v with the trivial r action is the representation v c q 1 the representation v v contains a subrepresentation v v c q 1 which is a faithful g representation by proposition a 1 i so v v is faithful lemma a 2 for any gnz defined in a 1 is a functor from the category of g spaces to the category of g spaces moreover c q 1 and in proposition a 1 are also well defined functors from the category of g spaces to the category of g spaces proof let f v w be ag equivariant map then f is cg equivairant for each gnz for each irreducible complex cg representation f v w is cg equivairant and f v w v 7 f v with the same underlying spaces is well defined and is g equivariant it is straightforward to check if we have two g equivariant maps f v w and g u v then f g f g so gives a well defined functor from the category of g representations to the category of g representation the other conclusions can be proved in a similar way proposition a 3 let h and g be two compact lie groups let gnz and hnz let v be a g representation and w a h representation i we have the isomorphisms of representations v w v w as g h g tn h representations v w v w c q 1 v v c q 1 w w c q 1 as g h g tn h representations and v w v w v v w w as g h g tn h representations ii let h g be a group homomorphism let h g denote the group homomorphism obtained from then we have v v v v c q 1 v v c q 1 v v v v as h representations proof i let g and h denote the sets of all the irreducible cg representations and all the irreducible ch representations then g and h are irreducible representations of cg h via the inclusion cg cg h and ch cg h the r representation assigned to each cg h irreducible representation in v w is the same as that assigned to the irreducible representations of v and w so we have v w v w as g h g tn h representations similarly we can prove the other two conclusions in i ii let if v h is a ch subrepresentation of v g the r representation assigned to it is the same as that to v g so we have v v as h representations similarly we can prove the other two conclusions in ii 16 zhen huan a 2 real g representation in this section we discuss real g representation and its relation with the complex g representations introduced in lemma 2 1 the main reference is 2 and 4 let g be a compact lie group and gnz definition a 4 a complex representation g autc v is said to be self dual if it is isomorphic to its complex dual g autc v where v homc v c and g g 1 for any compact lie group we use ro g to denote the real representation ring of g we have the real version of lemma 2 1 below the proof of lemma a 5 is left to the readers lemma a 5 let gnz then the map ro tn ro g exhibits ro g as a free ro t n module in particular there is an ro t basis of ro g given by irreducible real representations v there is a bijection between v and the set of irre ducible real representations of cg when is trivial v has the same underlying space v as when is nontrivial v r c c 1 n r c c 1 n where each i is a complex r representation such that r c i acts on v r c via the scalar multiplication by i 1 the dimension of v is twice as that of as in a 1 we can construct a functor r from the category of realg representations to the category of real g representations with a 2 v r v r c v r c proposition a 6 let v be a faithful realg representation for each gnz v r is a faithful real g representation proof let a t g be an element acting trivially on v r assume t 0 1 let v v r c and let v denote its correspondence in v r c then a t v v ae 2 imt ae 2 imt v v v v where m is a nonzero number determined by thus a is equal to both e 2 imti and e 2 imti thus t 0 and a is trivial so v r is a faithful real g representation proposition a 7 let h and g be two compact lie groups let gnz and hnz let v be a real g representation and w a real h representation i we have the isomorphisms of representations v w r v r w r as g h g tn h representations ii let h g be a group homomorphism let h g denote the group homomorphism obtained from then v r v r as h representations the proof is left to the readers references 1 matthew ando michael j hopkins and neil p strickland elliptic spectra the witten genus and
