ensure that one such representing measure is 6 atomic 1 introduction in this paper we find a direct proof that the nonsingular quartic binary moment problem always admits a finitely atomic representing measure with the minimum number of atoms that is six atoms we do this in three steps i by normalizing the given moment matrix m 2 to ensure that m 1 is the identity matrix ii by developing a new rank reduction tool which allows us to decompose the normalized m 2 matrix as the sum of a positive semidefinite moment matrix m 2 of rank 5 and the rank one moment matrix of the point mass at the origin and iii by proving that when a moment matrix m 2 admits such a decomposition and m 2 admits a column relation subordinate to a degenerate hyperbola i e a pair of intersecting lines then m 2 admits a 6 atomic representing measure as opposed to the expected 7 atomic measure to describe our results in detail we need some notation and terminology given real numbers 4 00 10 01

measure as follows let p 4 be the cone of nonnegative polynomials of degree at most 4 in x y regarded as a subset of r 15 the dual cone is p 4 r 15 p 0 for all p p 4 if a b r and a b 1 a b a 2 ab b 2 a 3 a 2 b ab 2 b 3 a 4 a 3 b a 2 b 2 ab 3 b 4 r 15 then a b p p a b 0 for all p p 4 thus a b p 4 for all a b r and a b is also an extreme point consider now an arbitrary moment sequence 4 with a nonsingular moment matrix m 2 regarded as a point in r 15 4 is in the interior of p 4 since every p p 4 is a sum of squares of polynomials by the krein milman theorem and carathe odory s theorem the riesz functional 4 is a convex combination of evaluations a b that is 4 admits a finitely atomic representing measure with at most 15 atoms in recent related work l a fialkow and j nie fini have obtained this result as a consequence of a more general result on moment problems in this note we obtain a concrete 6 atomic representing measure for m 2 the quartic real binary moment problem admits an equivalent formulation in terms of complex numbers and representing measures supported in the complex plane c as follows given complex numbers 4 00 01 10 02 11 20 03 12 21 30 04 13 22 31 40 with ij ji one seeks necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a positive borel measure supported in c such that ij z izj d 0 i j 4 just as in the real case the quartic complex moment problem has an associated moment matrix m 2 whose columns are conveniently labeled 1 z z z 2 z z z 2 the most interesting case of the singular quartic binary moment problem arises when the rank of m 2 is 5 and the sixth column of m 2 labeled z 2 is a linear combination of the remaining five columns depending on the coefficients in the linear combination four subcases arise in terms of the associated conic c cufi 3 section 5 i c is a parabola ii c is a nondegenerate hyperbola iii c is a pair of intersecting lines and iv c is a circle in subcase iii it is possible to prove that the number of atoms in a representing measure if it exists may be 6 cufi 3 proposition 5 5 and example 5 6 that is in some soluble cases the rank of m 2 may be strictly smaller than the number of atoms in any representing measure proposition 1 1 cufi 3 proposition 5 5 if m 2 0 if rankm 2 5 and if xy 0 in the column space of m 2 then m 2 admits a representing measure with card supp 6 when combined with previous work on truncated moment problems proposi tion 1 1 led to the following solution to the truncated moment problem on pla nar curves of degree 2 given a moment matrix m n and a polynomial concrete solution to the nonsingular quartic binary moment problem 3 p x y pijx iyj we let p x y pijx iy j a column relation in m n is therefore always described as p x y 0 for some polynomial p with deg p n we say that m n is recursively generated if for every p with p x y 0 and every q such that deg pq n one has pq x y 0 in what follows v denotes the cardinality of the associated algebraic variety defined as the intersection of the zero sets of all polynomials which describe the column relations in m n theorem 1 2 cufi 4 theorem 2 1 fia theorem 1 2 let p r x y with deg p x y 2 then 2 n has a representing measure supported in the curve p x y 0 if and only if m n has a column dependence relation p x y 0 m n 0 m n is recursively generated and r v the proof of theorem 1 2 made use of affine planar transformations to reduce a generic quadratic column relation to one of four canonical types y x 2 xy 1 xy 0 and x 2 y 2 1 each of these cases required an independent result we shall have occasion to use the affine planar transformation approach in section 3 to date most of the existing theory of truncated moment problems is founded on the presence of nontrivial column relations in the moment matrix m n on one hand when all columns labeled by monomials of degree n can be expressed as linear combinations of columns labeled by monomials of lower degree the matrix m n is flat and the moment problem has a unique representing measure which is finitely atomic with exactly rankm n 1 atoms cufi 1 theorem 1 1 as a straightforward consequence we conclude that for n 1 an invertible m n always admits a flat extension while that is not the case for n 3 that is there exist examples of positive and invertible m 3 without a representing measure cf cufi 1 section 4 when n 2 the idea is to extend the 6 6 moment matrix m 2 to a bigger 10 10 moment matrix m 3 by adding so called b and c blocks as follows m 3 m 2 b 3 b 3 c 3 a result of j l smul jan smu states that m 3 0 if and only if i m 2 0 ii b 3 m 2 w for some w and iii c 3 w m 2 w moreover m 3 is a flat extension of m 2 i e rankm 3 rankm 2 if and only if c 3 w m 2 w further when m 2 is invertible one easily obtains w m 2 1 b 3 so in the flat extension case c 3 can be written asb 3 m 2 1 b 3 however writing a general formula for m 3 is nontrivial even with the aid of mathematica because of the complexity of m 2 1 and the new moments con tributed by the block b 3 on the other hand if only one column relation is present given by p x y 0 then v and the condition r v while nec essary will not suffice one knows that the support of a representing measure must lie in the zero set of p but this does not provide enough information to decipher the block b 3 the situation is much more intriguing when no column relations are present this is the nonsingular case for which very little is known 2 statement of the main result theorem 2 1 assume m 2 is positive and invertible then m 2 admits a representing measure with exactly 6 atoms that is m 2 actually admits a flat extension m 3 4 rau l e curto and seonguk yoo the proof of theorem 2 1 is constructive in that we first prove that it is always possible to switch from the invertible m 2 to a related singular matrix m 2 with rankm 2 5 for which theorem 1 2 applies since singular positive semidefinite matrices m 2 always admit representing measures with 6 atoms or less we can then conclude that an invertible positive m 2 admits a representing measure with at most 7 atoms while this would already represent a significant improvement on the upper bound given by carathe odory s theorem 15 atoms we have been able to establish that all positive invertible m 2 s actually have flat extensions and therefore their representing measures can have exactly 6 atoms 3 a new tool we begin this section with a result that will allow us to convert a given moment problem into a simpler equivalent moment problem one of the consequences of this result is the equivalence of the real and complex moment problems via the transformation x re z and y im z this equivalence has been exploited amply in the theory of truncated moment problems for us however this simplification will allow us to assume that the submatrix m 1 is the identity matrix we adapt the notation in cufi 3 to the real case for a b c d e f r bf ce 6 0 let x y 1 x y 2 x y a bx cy d ex fy x y r given 2 n define 2 n by ij l i 1 j 2 0 i j 2 n where l denotes the riesz functional associated with for p x y pijx iyj the riesz functional is given by l p p pij ij it is straightforward to verify that l p l p for every p of degree at most n proposition 3 1 invariance under degree one transformations cufi 3 let m n and m n be the moment matrices associated with and and let jp p then the following statements hold i m n j m n j ii j is invertible iii m n 0 m n 0 iv rankm n rankm n v m n admits a flat extension if and only if m n admits a flat extension we are now ready to put m 2 in normalized form without loss of generality we always assume that 00 1 let di denote the leading principal minors ofm 2 in particular d 2 2 10 20 d 3 02 2 10 2 01 10 11 2 11 2 01 20 02 20 consider now the degree one transformation x y a bx cy d ex fy where a 01 20 10 11 d 2 d 3 b 11 01 10 d 2 d 3 c d 2 d 3 d 10 d 2 e 1 d 2 and f 0 note that bf ce 1 d 3 6 0 using this transformation and a straightforward calculation we can prove that any positive definite moment matrix concrete solution to the nonsingular quartic binary moment problem 5 m 2 can be transformed into the moment matrix 1 0

new tool in the study of moment matrices the decomposition of an invertible m 2 as a sum of a moment matrix of rank 5 and a rank one moment matrix assume now that m 2 is invertible and that the submatrix m 1 is the identity matrix for u r decompose m 2 as follows m 2 1 u 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 30 21 12 0 0 1 21 12 03 1 30 21 40 31 22 0 21 12 31 22 13 1 12 03 22 13 04 u 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 denote the first summand by m 2 and the second summand by p it is clear that p is positive semidefinite and has rank 1 if and only if u 0 and in that case p is the moment matrix of the 1 atomic measure u 0 0 where 0 0 is the point mass at the origin proposition 3 2 let m 2 m 2 and p be as above and let u 0 detm 2 r 11 where r 11 is the 1 1 entry in the positive matrix r m 2 1 then with this nonnegative value of u we have i m 2 0 ii rankm 2 5 and iii m 2 is recursively generated moreover u 0 is the only value of u for which m 2 satisfies i iii for the proof of proposition 3 2 we will need to following auxiliary result which is an easy consequence of the multilinearity of the determinant lemma 3 3 let m be an n n invertible matrix of real numbers let e 11 be the rank one matrix with 1 1 entry equal to 1 and all other entries are equal to zero and let u r then det m ue 11 detm u detm 2 3 n where m 2 3 n denotes the n 1 n 1 compression of m to the last n 1 rows and columns in particular if u detm m 1 11 then det m ue 11 0 proof of proposition 3 2 ii observe that 6 rank m 2 rank m 2 rank p rank m 2 1 so rank m 2 5 since detm 2 0 we have rank m 2 5 i using the nested determinant test starting at the lower right hand corner of m 2 we know that m 2 is positive semidefinite since the nested determinants corresponding to principal minors of size 1 2 3 4 and 5 are all positive and the rank of m 2 is 5 this also implies that 1 u 0 we now claim that 1 u is strictly positive if 1 u 0 then the positive semidefiniteness of m 2 would 6 rau l e curto and seonguk yoo force all entries in the first row to be zero since this is evidently false we conclude that 1 u 0 iii it is sufficient to show that the first three columns of m 2 are linearly independent consider the third leading principal minor of m 2 which equals 1 u and is therefore positive thus there is no linear dependence in this submatrix and as a result the same holds in m 2 finally the uniqueness of u 0 as the only value satisfying i iii is clear 4 proof of the main result we first observe that by combining proposition 3 2 with theorem 1 2 it suffices to consider the case when m 2 has a column relation corresponding to a pair of intersecting lines for in all other cases there exists a representing measure for m 2 with exactly five atoms when combined with the additional atom coming from the matrix p we see that m 2 admits a 6 atomic representing measure we thus focus on the case when m 2 is subordinate to a degenerate hyper bola after applying an additional degree one transformation we can assume as in proposition 1 1 that the column relation xy 0 is present in m 2 however we may not continue to assume that the submatrix m 1 is the identity matrix since the degree one transformation that produces the column relation xy 0 will in general change the low order moments that is m 2 is of the form m 2 1 a b c 0 d a c 0 e 0 0 b 0 d 0 0 f c e 0 g 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 d 0 f 0 0 h in this case the original moment matrix m 2 is written as m 2 m 2 u 1 p q p 2 p q q 2 t 1 p q p 2 p q q 2 for some u 0 and p q 6 0 that is m 2 is the sum of a moment matrix of rank 5 with column relation xy 0 and a positive scalar multiple of the moment matrix associated with the point mass at p q with pq 6 0 without loss of generality we can assume that p q 1 this requires an obvious degree one transformation i e x x p y y q as a result the form of m 2 is now as follows m 2 1 u a u b u c u u d u a u c u u e u u u b u u d u u u f u c u e u u g u u u u u u u u u d u u f u u u h u we will show that m 2 admits a flat extension and that will readily imply that it admits a rank m 2 atomic that is 6 atomic representing measure the b 3 block in an extension m 3 can be generated by letting 41 32 23 14 u concrete solution to the nonsingular quartic binary moment problem 7 so that b 3 can thus be written as e u u u f u g u u u u u u u h u 50 u u u u u u u u u u 05 as usual let w m 2 1 b 3 and let c 3 cij w m 2 w note that if c 3 turns out to be hankel then m 3 is a flat extension of m 2 since c 3 is symmetric to ensure that c 3 is hankel and therefore m 3 is a moment matrix we only need to solve the following system of equations e 1 c 13 c 22 0 e 2 c 14 c 23 0 e 3 c 24 c 33 0 4 1 this is a system of equations involving quadratic polynomials with 2 unknown variables the new moments 50 and 05 a straightforward calculation shows that e 1 0 e 3 0 and that e 2 0 c 2 ae d 2 bf 50 05 c 2 ae f 3 2 dfh bh 2 d 2 u bfu 50 d 2 bf e 3 2 ceg ag 2 c 2 u aeu 05 e 3 2 ceg ag 2 c 2 u aeu f 3 2 dfh bh 2 d 2 u bfu 0 50 05 50 05 0 where and have the obvious definitions if 6 0 then 05 50 50 for 50 6 which readily implies that e 2 0 admits infinitely many solutions when 0 and 6 0 we see that e 2 05 from which it follows that a solution always exists and it is unique when 6 0 a similar argument shows that 6 0 and 0 also yields a solution which is unique when 6 0 we are thus left with the case when both c 2 ae and d 2 bf are equal to zero since c and d are in the diagonal of a positive semidefinite matrix they must be positive thus all of a b e and f are nonzero and we can set e c 2 a and f d 2 b in this case the moment matrix is m 2 1 u a u b u c u u d u a u c u u c 2 a u u u b u u d u u u d 2 b u c u c 2 a u u g u u u u u u u u u d u u d 2 b u u u h u let k detm 2 detm 2 2 3 4 5 6 as in the proof of proposition 3 2 we see that k b 2 c a 2 d cd cd 0 and the first summand in the following decomposition of 8 rau l e curto and seonguk yoo m 2 has rank 5 and is positive semidefinite note that the 1 1 entry is 1 u k m 2 b 2 c a 2 d cdu cd a u b u c u u d u a u c u u c 2 au a u u b u u d u u u d 2 bu b c u c 2 au a u g u u u u u u u u u d u u d 2 bu b u u h

represents this column relation is a nondegenerate hyperbola and therefore the moment sequence associated to the moment matrix has a 5 atomic measure by theorem 1 2 in the case when the conic in 4 2 is a pair of intersecting lines i e x y 0 we must have c a or d b thus the remaining two specific cases to cover are m 2 with c a or d b since m 2 is invertible for any b 3 block we will be able to find w such that m 2 w b 3 we propose to use a b 3 block with new moments 32 23 14 0 and to then extend m 2 to m 3 using smul jan s lemma that is we will define c 3 w b 3 the goal is to establish that c 3 is a hankel matrix and that requires verification of 4 1 before we begin our detailed analysis we need to make a few observations let di denote the principal minor of m 2 for i 1 6 since m 2 is positive and invertible we know that these minors are all positive then d 5 b 2 c a 2 d cd c 3 a 2 g u a 2 and d 6 d 5 d 3 b 2 h b 2 which implies b 2 c a 2 d cd c 3 a 2 g 0 and d 3 b 2 h 0 4 3 next we use mathematica to solve e 1 0 for 50 and e 3 0 for 05 and we obtain 50 1 a 2 c b 2 c a 2 d cd d 3 b 2 h u 11 2 41 12 41 13 05 1 b 2 d b 2 c a 2 d cd c 3 a 2 g 21 41 22 where the ij s are polynomials in a b c d g h and u since a b 6 0 c d 0 we can use 4 3 to show that both 50 and 05 above are well defined we now substitute these values in e 2 and check that e 2 is a quadratic polynomial in 41 indeed we can readily show that the leading coefficient of e 2 is nonzero if c a or d b thus if the discriminant of this quadratic polynomial is nonnegative then 4 1 has at least one solution we are now ready to deal with the two special cases c a and d b if c a then a 2 u 2 a g 2 d 3 b 2 h 2 f 1 a b d h b 4 d 2 where f 1 a b d h 1 a 2 b 2 h 2 2 b 2 d 2 b 2 3 d 3 ad h d 4 3 b 2 4

16 b 2 d 2 b 2 d ad 3 needs to be zero or negative in this case we observe that c a 0 d 3 ab 2 ad a 2 d au a 2 u b 2 u du adu 0 d 4 d 3 a g 0 a g 0 d 5 a b 2 d ad a g u 0 which leads to b 2 d ad 0
