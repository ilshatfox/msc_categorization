on a hilbert space h and let t v t be the polar decomposition of t the mean transform of t is defined by t 1 2 v t t v in this paper we study the iterates of the mean transform and we define the mean limit of an operator as the limit in the operator norm of those iterates we obtain new estimates for the numerical range and numerical radius of the mean transform in terms of the original operator for the special class of unilateral weighted shifts we describe the precise relationship between the spectral radius and the mean limit and obtain some sharp estimates 1 introduction leth be a hilbert space equipped with its inner product we denote by b h the algebra of all bounded linear operators onh and byu h the set of unitary operators on h for an arbitrary operator t b h we denote by r t n t and t the range the null subspace and the operator adjoint of t respectively the numerical range of t is the set w t t x x x h x 1 and the numerical radius of t is defined as w t sup w t we refer the reader to 14 for more information about the numerical range and numerical radius we also let t denote the spectrum of t and r t denote its spectral radius an operator t is said to be quasinormal if it commutes with t t for 0 p 1 we say that t is p hyponormal if t t p tt p in the case when p 1 and p 1 2 the operator t is called hyponormal and semi hyponormal respectively as usual for t b h we denote the modulus of t by t t t 1 2 and we shall always write without further mention t v t to be the canonical polar decomposition of t where v is the appropriate partial isometry satisfying n v n t the aluthge transform of t was defined in 1 by t t 1 2 v t 1 2 the mean transform of t recently introduced in 11 is given as 1 1 t 1 2 v t t v we refer the reader to 1 7 8 9 11 10 for such operator transforms it is well known that the quasinormal operators are exactly the fixed points of the aluthge transform and of the mean transform see 11 the sequences of iterates of mean and aluthge transforms of an operator t are denoted by t n and n t respectively with t 0 0 t t t n 1 t n and n 1 t n t a list of detailed and informative articles on the subject includes 2 9 11 10 2010

mostafa mbekhta in the next sections we establish some new properties of the mean transform we also introduce the mean limit of an operator and we study the mean transform iterates in some particular cases moreover we obtain several new relations between the aluthge and mean transforms for unilateral weighted shifts for this class of operators we obtain some sharp estimates for the spectral radius of the mean transform and the mean limit 2 some results about the mean transform contrary to what happens with the aluthge transform the mean transform does depend on the polar decomposition of the given operator for example consider t 0 1 0 0 acting on c 2 the canonical polar decomposition of t is t v t where t t t 0 0 0 1 and v 0 1 0 0 on the other hand we can also write t umax t where umax 0 1 1 0 is unitary this is the so called maximal polar decomposition of t since the partial isometry is unitary in this case umax t t umax 0 1 1 0 v t t v 0 1 0 0 which shows that the mean transform depends on the polar decomposition in what fol lows we will always use the canonical polar decomposition when dealing with the mean transform proposition 2 1 let t b h be an arbitrary operator then we have n t n t in particular t 0 if and only if t 0 proof let t v t be the canonical polar decomposition of t and let x n t n v then t x vx 0 and thus t x 1 2 v t x t vx 0 this show that n t n t conversely if x n t then v t x t vx 0 and hence t x v t vx v v t t v x 0 it follows that t x x v t vx x t x v t vx x 0 since t and v t v are both positive we obtain t 1 2 x t x x 0 as a consequence n t n t n t as desired theorem 2 2 let t b h then the following statements are equivalent i t is invertible ii t is invertible and r t is closed proof let t v t be the canonical polar decomposition of t i ii we assume that t is invertible then r t h is closed moreover v is unitary and the operators t and v t v are positive and invertible hence t 0 v t v 0 and v t 1 2 t v t v 0 is invertible it follows that t 12 v t v t v is also invertible ii i assume now that t is invertible from proposition 2 1 t is one to one so v is isometry i e v v i it follows that v t 1 2 t v t v is also invertible and its the mean transform and the mean limit of an operator 3 inverse is t 1 v therefore v is unitary since it maps n t isometrically onto r t therefore n t n t 0 since r t is closed r t r t n t h hence t is invertible this completes the proof remark 2 3 in theorem 2 2 ii the condition r t is closed is required without it the reverse implication is false as shown by the following example example 2 4 let us denote by en n z the canonical basis of 2 z and by t 2 z 2 z the weighted bilateral shift defined by ten nen 1 for all n z where n 1 if n even 1 n 2 if n odd the mean transform t is also a weighted shift and we have t en nen 1 for n z where n n n 1 2 1 1 n 1 2 2 if n even 1 1 n 2 2 if n odd clearly te 2 n 1 0 n and therefore the operator t is not invertible on the other hand we have 1 n 12 for all n z and from this it follows that t is invertible remark 2 5 in general we have 1 t t see 11 2 t 1 t 1 see 10 proposition 2 6 let t b h then the following properties hold i for all c t t ii for every unitary or anti unitary operator u h h we have u tu ut u iii t i t i proof i straightforward from 1 1 ii let t v t be the polar decomposition of t and let u h h be a unitary operator first note that utu u t u and we therefore have utu uv t u uvu u t u v utu where v uvu observe that v is a partial isometry andn utu n v it follows that v utu is the polar decomposition of utu this implies that utu 1 2 v utu utu v 1 2 uv t u u t vu ut u when u is anti unitary the result is obtained in a similar fashion iii the implication is obvious so we focus on assume that t i hence v v t 1 2 t v t v is a positive partial isometry in particular v v is an orthogonal projection on the other hand still using t i we can use proposition 2 1 i and conclude that t is one to one then v is an isometry so v v v 2 i therefore v i and t t i 4 fadil chabbabi ra l e curto and mostafa mbekhta lemma 2 7 heinz inequality cf 6 let a b x b h such that a and b are positive operators then a 1 2 xb 1 2 ax xb 2 corollary 2 8 let t b h then t t t in particular r t t for partial isometries we have the following result proposition 2 9 let v b h be a partial isometry then v 1 2 i v v v in particular v v proof the modulus of v is v v v and the polar decomposition of v is v v v v hence 2 1 v 1 2 v v vv 1 2 i v v v since vv v v it follows that 2 2 v 0 1 2 i v v v 0 1 2 v i v v 0 v 0 now observe that if v is invertible then v v i and therefore v v it follows that v is also invertible conversely if v is invertible then 2 1 implies that v is left invertible that is v is an isometry this means v v i and therefore v v and a fortiori v is also invertible this argument together with 2 2 establishes the equality of the spectra by corollary 2 8 t t as a consequence the norm of the iterated mean trans forms t n n n is a non increasing sequence since it is bounded below by 0 it con verges we denote the limit by t definition 2 10 let t b h the mean limit t is the limit in norm of the sequence of mean transform iterates that is t lim n t n inf n n t n remark 2 11 let u u h and c then i utu t and t t ii in the case when t is quasinormal t t r t iii if t 2 0 then t n 1 2 n t as a consequence t 0 for the reader s convenience we provide a proof of iii consider the canonical polar decomposition t v t and recall that r t r v since t 2 0 we must have r t n t n t it then follows that t v 0 which readily implies t 12 t the desired result is now clear it is now natural to formulate the following problem 2 12 for a general bounded linear operator t b h describe what t says about t for x y h x 0 y 0 we denote by x y the rank one operator defined by x y u u y x u h the mean transform and the mean limit of an operator 5 the aluthge transform 2 of a rank one operator is given in 3 as follows x y x y y 2 y y in the following lemma we give the mean transform of this class of operators and we show that the sequence of their mean iterates converges to the aluthge transform lemma 2 13 let x y h be two nonzero vectors let t x y be the rank one operator with range generated by x and let n n then the n th iterate of t is t n 1 2 n x 2 n 1 x y y 2 y y in particular t n n t and t x y r t proof we first exhibit the mean transform of a rank one operator a simple calculation yields t t t x y y y let v 1 x y x y we then haven v n t and v v 1 y 2 y y is an orthogonal projection hence v is a partial isometry and v t 1 x y x y x y y y t therefore t v t is the canonical polar decomposition of t it follows that t 1 2 v t t v 1 2 x y x y y y 1 x y x y 1 2 x y x y y 2 y y 1 2 x x y y 2 y y now by induction on n the equality t n 1 2 n x 2 n 1 x y y 2 y y holds immediately moreover t n n x y y 2 y y t in particular t x y r t to study the mean iterates of a large class of hilbert space operators we will first need the following result lemma 2 14 let t b h with canonical polar decomposition t v t the follow ing assertions are equivalent 1 n t n t 2 vv t t vv t 3 v is quasinormal i e vv v v 6 fadil chabbabi ra l e curto and mostafa mbekhta in this case we have t 1 2 v t t v 1 2 v t v t v proof 1 2 suppose that 1 holds then n vv n v n t n t n t hence t i vv 0 thus vv t t vv t 2 3 suppose that 2 holds then n v n t n v it follows v i vv 0 hence vvv v and thus v vv v 3 2 since v vv v we have v vvv hencen v n v and n t n v n v n t this completes the proof we now state and prove one of our main results theorem 2 15 let t b h and suppose that n t n t let t v t be the canonical polar decomposition of t and let n n then 2 3 t n 1 2 n v j n j 0 nj v j t v j proof we will use induction on n for n 0 the equality 2 3 holds immediately since n t n t we can use lemma 2 14 to conclude that t 1 2 v t t v 1 2 v t v t v in particular 2 3 holds also for n 1 we now assume that 2 3 holds for n n n 1 from proposition 2 1 we have n v n t n t n since v vv v it follows that t n 1 2 n j n j 0 nj v j t v j hence t n v t n is the canonical polar decomposition of t n thus t n 1 t n t n v 2 1 2 n 1 v j n j 0 nj v j t v j j n j 0 nj v j t v j v 1 2 n 1 v j n j 0 nj v j t v j v j 1 t v j 1 1 2 n 1 v j n 1 j 0 n 1 j v j t v j hence 2 3 holds for n 1 this completes the proof the mean transform and the mean limit of an operator 7 corollary 2 16 let t b h be such that t and t are one to one then t n t n for all n n in particular t and t have the same mean limit t t theorem 2 17 let t b h and suppose thatn t n t if t is a semi hyponormal operator then t is also semi hyponormal moreover the sequence of mean iterates con verges in the strong operator topology to a normal operator l b h and we have t l t n for all n n proof let t v t be the polar decomposition of t it is easy to get that t v t v suppose that t is semi hyponormal then t v t v t multiplying this inequality by v on the left and by v on the right we get that 2 4 v t v t v t v on the other hand sincen t n t lemma 2 14 and a simple calculation yield t 1 2 t v t v hence it follows from lemma 2 14 again that t v t is the canonical polar decomposi tion of t and t v t v 1 2 v t v vv t vv 1 2 v t v t since vv t t 1 2 t v t v t see 2 4 this shows that t is semi hyponormal sincen t n t we have r t r t and n t n t for the first inclusion note that the condition on the kernels implies that r t r t it follows by definition of t that r t r t the second inclusion is obtained as follows t x 0 t x v t x 0 v t v x vv t x 0 v t v x t x 0 since vv t t x n t n t n t now by the induction we obtain for all n n r t n r t n t n n t n and t n is semi hyponormal we also know that t n v t n is the canonical polar decomposition of t n with t n 1 1 2 t n v t n v t n by 2 4 2 5 in particular t n n n is an increasing sequence so it converges in the strong operator topology to a positive operator a b h with r a r t it follows that vv a a from 2 5 a satisfies a 12 a v av and therefore va av it follows that t n v t n strongly converges to the normal operator l va av again from 2 5 we obtain t n 1 t n t l for all n n as desired 8 fadil chabbabi ra l e curto and mostafa mbekhta remark 2 18 under the assumption of theorem 3 1 if the sequence v k t vk k n con verges in the strong resp weak operator topology to an operator a b h then so does the sequence of operator mean iterates t n n n the limit is the normal operator l va av 3 numerical range and numerical radius theorem 3 1 let t b h then w t w t where w t denotes the closure of the numerical range w t of t in particular w t w t proof recall first the well known formula for the numerical range see 14 theorem 4 and corollary w t c t i let t v t be the canonical polar decomposition of t from 4 lemma 2 3 we have t v i t i all c therefore w t c t i c 1 2 t i t v i c 1 2 t i t v i c t i w t lemma 3 2 cf 12 let a b x b h such that a b are positive then w a 1 2 xb 1 2 w a xb 1 a 1 xb 2 for all 0 1 as a direct consequence of theorem 3 1 and lemma 3 2 we get the following result corollary 3 3 let t b h be an arbitrary operator and recall that t denotes the aluthge transform of t then w t w t w t 4 the mean limit for unilateral weighted shifts let 2 n be the hilbert space of complex square summable sequences x xi i n with the norm x i n xi 2 1 2 given any bounded sequence of strictly positive numbers i i n the associated unilateral weighted shift w shift 0 1 2 n 2 n is defined by w x 0 x 1 0 0 x 0 1 x 1 where x xi i n 2 n when i 1 for all i w w is simply the standard unweighted unilateral shift on 2 n the mean transform and the mean limit of an operator 9 clearly w is a bounded linear operator on 2 n with operator norm w sup i n i the spectral radius of w is well known see for example 5 problem 91 4 1 r w lim n sup k n k k n 1 1 n the spectrum of w is given in 13 p 66 theorem 4 by w c r w the aluthge transform w of w is also a unilateral weighted shift w w shift 0 1 1 2 by induction the iterates of the aluthge transform are given in 9 by n w w n where n n i i n n j 0 n j i j 1 2 n i n and n j n j n j as explained in 11 the mean transform w of w is w w shift 0 1 2 1 2 2 the mean iterates of the weighted shift w n are also weighted shifts with weight se quences 4 2 n n i i n n i 0 n j i j 2 n i n we remark that for a sequence of strictly positive numbers i i n we have the following relation between the iterates of aluthge and mean transforms wexp n n wexp where exp exp i i n for any sequence i i n in contrast to what happens with the iterates of the aluthge transform the spectrum of the mean transform is not the same as the spectrum of the original operator moreover in general the sequence of norms of the mean iterates does not converge to the spectral radius as shown by the following example example 4 1 let w be the unilateral weighted shift defined by i i n where i 2 1 i as proven in 11 w 2 u the unweighted unilateral shift and is therefore quasi normal however w is not quasinormal this proves that the inverse mean transform does not preserve the set of quasinormal operators on the other hand by the formula for the spectral radius of a unilateral weighted shift w given in 5 problem 91 we get the following r w lim n sup k n k k n 1 1 n lim n sup k n k j k n 1 2 1 j 1 n lim n sup k n k j k n 1 and j peer 3 1 n lim n 3 n 2 1 n where 1 0 1 lim n 3 1 2 n 3 10 fadil chabbabi ra l e curto and mostafa mbekhta hence from 13 section 4 we conclude that w c 3 w 2 u c 2 on the other hand the mean iterates of w are w n 2 u for all n n therefore w 2 r w thus in general the sequence of operator mean iterates does not converge to the spectral radius this is in sharp contrast to what happens for the aluthge transform see 15 theorem 4 2 let i i n be a sequence of strictly positive numbers and let w be the associate weighted shift then r w r w proof from the spectral radius formula we obtain r w r w lim n sup i n n 1 j 0 i j 1 n lim n sup i n n 1 j 0 i j i j 1 1 n lim n sup i n n 1 j 0 1 2 i j i j 1 1 n ab 1 2 a b lim n sup i n n 1 j 0 i j 1 n r w as a direct consequence we have the following result corollary 4 3 for a unilateral weighted shift w we have w w theorem 4 4 let i i n be a sequence of strictly positive numbers and let exp the following estimate for the mean limit of w holds r w log r w w proof using the iterates of aluthge and mean transforms for the weighted shift w and yamazaki s formula for the spectral radius via the iterates of the aluthge transform we get r w lim n n w lim n sup i n n j 0 n j i j 1 2 n yamazaki s formula 4 3 the mean transform and the mean limit of an operator 11 using 4 3 and the particular form of the mean iterates of a unilateral weighted shift cf 4 2 we obtain w lim n w n lim n sup i n n i 0 n j i j 2 n lim n sup i n n i 0 n j log i j 2 n recall that log k k for all k n log lim n sup i n n j 0 n j i j 1 2 n log lim n n w log

lim n sup i n 1 n n 1 j 0 i j lim n sup i n n 1 j 0 i j 1 n using the arithmetic geometric mean inequality r w remark 4 5 in general the inequality in theorem 4 4 can be strict as shown in example 4 1 on the other hand when the sequence i i n converges we have the following proposition 4 6 let i i n be a sequence of positive numbers i 0 and assume that converges then w r w lim i i proof we let r 0 r w lim i i then for every 0 there exists n 0 n such that i r 0 for all i n 0 on the other hand n j 2 n k n j 1 2 n n 0 for any 0 i n 0 where k is a fixed constant then n 0 j 0 n j 2 n n 0 hence there exists n 1 n 0 such that n 0 j 0 n j 2 n for all n n 1 12 fadil chabbabi ra l e curto and mostafa mbekhta on the other hand for n n 1 we have w n r 0 sup i n n i r 0 sup i n n i r 0 sup i n n j 0 n j i j 2 n r 0 sup i n n j 0 n j i j r 0 2 n sup i n n j 0 n j i j r 0 2 n sup i n n 0 j 0 n j i j r 0 2 n m n j n 0 1 n j i j r 0 2 n n j n 0 1 n j 2 n 1 m 1 where m sup i n i r 0 this completes the proof remark 4 7 any semi hyponormal unilateral weighted shift has a weight sequence satis fying the hypothesis of proposition 4 6 acknowledgments the authors would like to thank the referee for
