the op erator t t 12 u t 12 this transform was first considered in 1 in order to study p hyponormal and log hyponormal operators roughly speaking the idea behind the aluthge transform is to convert an operator into another oper ator which shares with the first one some spectral properties but it is closer to being a normal operator in recent years the aluthge transform has received substantial attention jung ko and pearcy proved in 17 that t has a nontriv ial invariant subspace if and only if t does since every normal operator has nontrivial invariant subspaces the aluthge transform has a natural connection with the invariant subspace problem for a weighted shift w shift 0 1 the aluthge transform w of w is also a unilateral weighted shift given by w shift 0 1 1 2 see 18 we recall that w is hyponormal if and only if 0 1 thus if w is hyponormal then w is also hyponormal however the converse is not true in general for example if w shift 1 2 2 1 2 2 then w is clearly not hyponormal but w u is subnormal here and in what follows u denotes the unweighted unilateral shift in 18 s h lee w y lee and the second named author showed that for k 2 the aluthge transform when acting on weighted shifts need not preserve k hyponormality finally g exner proved in 14 that the aluthge transform of a subnormal weighted shift need not be subnormal in this article we first introduce the polar decompositions of a commut ing pair of bounded operators and study two aluthge transforms toral and spherical of 2 variable weighted shifts w t 1 t 2 since a priori there are several possible notions we discuss two plausible definitions and their basic properties in section 2 our research will allow us to compare both definitions in terms of how well they generalize the 1 variable notion after discussing some basic properties of each aluthge transform we proceed to study both 2 transforms in the case of 2 variable weighted shifts we consider such topics as preservation of joint hyponormality norm continuity spherical quasinormality and spherical isometries we first recall that a commuting pair is subnormal if and only if it is k hyponormal for every k 1 see 7 theorem 2 3 for i 1 2 we consider the polar decomposition ti ui ti of ti then for a 2 variable weighted shift w t 1 t 2 we define the toral aluthge transform of w as follows w t 1 t 2 t 1 1 2 u 1 t 1 1 2 t 2 1 2 u 2 t 2 1 2 as we will see in proposition 2 1 the commutativity of w does not automatically follow from the commutativity of w there is a second plausible definition of aluthge transform which uses a joint polar decomposition assume that we have a decomposition of the form t 1 t 2 u 1 p u 2 p where p t 1 t 1 t 2 t 2 and ker u 1 ker u 2 ker p now let w t 1 t 2 pu 1 p pu 2 p we refer to w as the spherical aluthge transform of w even though t 1 pu 1 p is not the aluthge transform of t 1 we observe that q u 1 u 1 u 2 u 2 is a joint partial isometry for pq 2 p p 2 from which it follows that q is isometric on the range of p we will prove in section 2 that this particular definition of the aluthge transform preserves commutativity and it also behaves well in terms of hy ponormality for a large class of 2 variable weighted shifts there is also an other useful aspect of the spherical aluthge transform which we now mention if we consider the fixed points of this transform acting on 2 variable weighted shifts we obtain an appropriate generalization of the concept of quasinormal ity more precisely if a 2 variable weighted shift w t 1 t 2 satisfies w t 1 t 2 then t 1 t 1 t 2 t 2 is up to scalar multiple a spherical isome try we recall that a commuting pair t t 1 t 2 is called a spherical isometry if p 2 t 1 t 1 t 2 t 2 i 13 it follows that we can then study some proper ties of the spherical aluthge transform using well known results about spherical isometries in this paper we also focus on the following basic problem problem 1 1 i for k 1 if w is k hyponormal does it follow that the toral aluthge transform w k hyponormal what about the case of the spherical aluthge transform when does either aluthge transform preserve hy ponormality ii when do we have the equality w w iii is the toral aluthge transform t 1 t 2 t 1 t 2 continuous in the uni form topology similarly does continuity hold for the spherical aluthge trans form 2 main results we first consider joint hyponormality for the toral and spherical aluthge transforms 3 proposition 2 1 i for w we have a w is a commuting pair if and only if k 1 k 2 1 k 1 1 k 2 1 k 1 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 2 for all k 1 k 2 0 with similar conditions holding for the weight sequence k 1 k 2 and b w is always a commuting pair ii if w is a commuting pair of hyponormal operators so is w we next show that there exists a subnormal w such that w is not hyponormal we also prove that there exists a non hyponormal w such that w is hyponormal we start with some definitions the core c w of w is the restriction of w to the invariant subspace m n where m e k 1 k 2 2 z 2 k 1 0 and k 2 1 andn e k 1 k 2 2 z 2 k 1 1 and k 2 0 given a 1 variable unilateral weighted shift w consider the 2 variable weighted shift w w on 2 z 2 given by the double indexed weight sequences k 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 for k 1 k 2 0 the shift w can be represented by the weight diagram in figure 1 ii lemma 2 2 8 let w be given by figure 1 ii and let k 1 w is k hyponormal if and only if w is jointly k hyponormal we next show that hyponormality is not stable under the toral aluthge transform 0 0 i ii iii 1 0 2 0 3 0 0 0 1 0 2 0 0 1 0 1 0 2 1 2 t 1 t 2 0 1 0

diagram of the 2 variable weighted shift with c w w weight diagram of a generic 2 variable weighted shift w t 1 t 2 and weight diagram of the aluthge transform w w of w respectively proposition 2 3 for 0 x y 1 let w be the 2 variable weighted shift in figure 1 i where 0 1 2 1 0 0 0 0 x 0 k 2 k 1 0 y k 1 k 2 1 and all remaining weights are equal to 1 then we have i w is subnormal if and only if x

pa y and ca y h y for all 0 y 1 while ca y s y on 0 q and ca y s y on q 1 where q 0 52138 thus w is hyponormal but w is not hyponormal if 0 ca y x s y and w is hyponormal but w is not hyponormal if 0 h y x pa y next we consider the invariance of hyponormality under the two aluthge transforms we describe a large class of 2 variable weighted shifts for which both transforms coincide by figure 1 ii and iii and direct calculations we observe that w w we now have theorem 2 4 if w is hyponormal then w and w are both hyponormal remark 2 5 as in the 1 variable case we use w shift 1 2 2 1 2 2 to build an example of a 2 variable weighted shift which is not subnormal but whose aluthge transforms are both subnormal i ii iii 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 a b c d b c d e c d e f t 1 t 2 0 1 0 2 y by a cy a by a cy a

to the continuity properties of the toral resp spherical aluthge transform of a commuting pair since the continuity of the toral aluthge transform is straightforward we focus on the spherical case the following result is well known for a single operator t b h the aluthge transform map t t is continuous on b h 12 we extend this to the multivariable case lemma 2 7 cf 12 lemma 2 1 let t t 1 t 2 be a pair of commuting operators and let t 1 t 2 u 1 p u 2 p be its joint polar decomposition recall that p t 1 t 1 t 2 t 2 for n n and t 0 let fn t max 1 n t and let an fn t then we have i an max n 1 2 p 1 2 ii pa 1 n p 1 2 iii an p 1 2 n 1 2 iv pa 1 n p 1 2 14 n 1 2 v for i 1 2 antia 1 n p 1 2 uip 1 2 5 4 n 1 2 ti 1 2 from lemma 2 7 we obtain lemma 2 8 cf 12 lemma 2 2 given r 1 and 0 there are real polynomials p and q such that for every commuting pair t t 1 t 2 with ti r i 1 2 we have p 1 2 uip 1 2 p t 1 t 1 t 2 t 2 tiq t 1 t 1 t 2 t 2 by lemmas 2 7 and 2 8 we have theorem 2 9 the spherical aluthge transform t 1 t 2 t 1 t 2 is continuous on b h we now study the class of spherically quasinormal resp spherically isomet ric commuting pairs of operators 2 3 4 13 15 16 in the literature spherical quasinormality of a commuting n tuple t t 1 tn is associated with the commutativity of each ti with p 2 it is not hard to prove that for 2 variable weighted shifts this is equivalent to requiring that w t 1 t 2 be a fixed point of the spherical aluthge transform that is w w a straightforward calculation shows that this is equivalent to requiring that each ui commutes with p in particular u 1 u 2 is commuting whenever t 1 t 2 is commuting also recall from section 1 that a commuting pair t is a spherical isometry if p 2 i thus in the case of spherically quasinormal 2 variable weighted shifts we always have u 1 u 1 u 2 u 2 i in the following result the key new ingredient is the equivalence of i and ii 6 theorem 2 10 for w t 1 t 2 the following statements are equivalent i w is spherically quasinormal ii for all k 1 k 2 z 2 2 k 1 k 2 2 k 1 k 2 c 0 iii t 1 t 1 t 2 t 2 c i sketch of proof briefly stated our strategy is as follows by the con tinuous functional calculus we can assume that t 1 and t 2 commute with p it follows that for all k 1 k 2 z 2 2 k 1 k 2 2 k 1 k 2 is constant next we compute t 1 t 1 t 2 t 2 by the proof of theorem 2 10 we remark that once the zero th row of t 1 call it w 0 is given then the entire 2 variable weighted shift is fully determined we briefly pause to recall the construction of stampfli s shift w a b c shift a b c where 0 a b c from 6 w a b c is subnormal with 2 atomic berger measure 0 s 0 1 s 1 where 0 ab c b b a 1 b c a b a s 0 1 2 1 4 0 2 s 1 1 2 1 4 0 2 0 s 1 a s 1 s 0 and 1 a s 0 s 1 s 0 we are now ready for theorem 2 11 consider a spherically quasinormal w t 1 t 2 given by figure 1 i where w 0 shift 0 0 1 0 w a b c for given k k 1 k 2 z 2 we let 2 k 1 k 2 2 k 1 k 2 1 where 1 is given as above then w is subnormal with berger measure s 1 a s 1 s 0 s 0 s 1 a s 0 s 1 s 0 s 1 s 0 the subnormality ofw in theorem 2 11 is a special case of the following result lemma 2 12 13 any spherical isometry is subnormal by theorem 2 10 and lemma 2 12 we obtain corollary 2 13 any spherically quasinormal 2 variable weighted shift is sub normal remark 2 14 i a athavale and s poddar have recently proved that a commuting spherically quasinormal pair is always subnormal 3 proposition 2 1 this provides a different proof of corollary 2 13 ii in a different direction let qt x t 1 xt 1 t 2 xt 2 by induction it is easy to prove that if t is spherically quasinormal then qn t i qt i n n 0 by 5 remark 4 6 t is subnormal acknowledgments the authors are deeply indebted to the referee for several helpful comments that improved the
