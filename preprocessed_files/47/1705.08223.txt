theorem states that if the numerical range w a of an n by n matrix a is contained in the unit disk d and intersects with the unit circle at more than n points then w a d an analogue of this result for compact a in an infinite dimensional setting was established by gau and wu we consider here the case of a being the sum of a normal and compact operator 1 introduction the numerical range also known as the field of values or the hausdorff set of a bounded linear operator a acting on a hilbert space h is defined as w a ax x x 1 here and stand for the scalar product on h and the norm generated by it respectively the set w a is a convex toeplitz hausdorff theorem bounded and in the case dimh also closed subset of the complex plane c we will use the standard notation x xo x x for the closure interior the boundary and the set of the limit points respectively of subsets x c in particular d z z 1 is the open unit disk d t is the unit circle and d d d is the closed unit disk the closure w a of the numerical range of a contains the spectrum a and thus the convex hull conv a of the latter for normal a w a conv a we refer to 4 for these and other well known properties of the numerical range anderson s theorem unpublished by the author but discussed e g in 2 states that if w a is contained in d and the intersection of w a with t consists of more than n dimh points then in fact w a d this result is sharp in a sense that for a unitary operator u with a simple spectrum acting on an n dimensional h w u is a polygon with n vertices on t and thus different from d unitary diagonal operators also deliver easy examples showing that anderson s theorem does not generalize to the infinite dimensional setting indeed if a is a diagonal operator with the point spectrum p u j j 1 2 t then w a conv p a d while w a t p a is infinite 2010 mathematics subject classification primary 47 a 12 secondary 47 b 07 47 b 15 47 b 37 key words and phrases numerical range normal operator compact operator

srivastava moreover according to 7 every bounded convex set g for which g go is the union of countably many singletons and conic arcs is the numerical range of some operator acting on a separable h on the positive side anderson s theorem generalizes quite naturally to the in finite dimensional case under some restrictions on the operators involved as was shown more recently in 3 the following result holds theorem 1 if a is a compact operator on a hilbert space with w a contained in d and w a intersecting t at infinitely many points then w a d in this paper we single out a wider class of operators for which analogs of anderson s theorem are valid in an infinite dimensional setting 2 main results we start with a lemma lemma 2 let a n k where n is normal and k is a compact operator on a hilbert space h if w a d and is a closed arc of t such that the intersection w a is infinite while ess a then w a recall that the essential spectrum ess a of an operator a is the set of c such that the operatora i is not fredholm equivalently ess a is the spectrum of the equivalence class of a in the calkin algebra of the algebra of bounded linear operators by the ideal of compact operators the proof of this lemma is delegated to the next section we will discuss here some of its consequences theorem 3 let a n k where n is normal and k is a compact operator on a hilbert space h let also w a d and be a relatively open subset of t disjoint with ess a if every connected component of contains limit points of its intersection with w a then w a proof connected components of are open arcs j writing j as k 1 jk where j 1 j 2 jk is an expanding family of closed arcs we see that jk satisfy the conditions of lemma 2 and thus jk w a for k large enough consequently j k 1 jk w a corollary 1 let a and satisfy the conditions of theorem 3 and in addition is dense in t then 2 1 d w a w a d proof by theorem 3 we have w a and so conv w a due to the convexity of the numerical range but being dense in t implies that conv d this proves the left inclusion in 2 1 the right equality then follows by combining d w a with the given w a d if the normal componentn ofa is in fact hermitian then ess a r choosing t 1 1 immediately yields anderson s theorem revisited 3 corollary 2 let a h k where h is hermitian and k is a compact operator on a hilbert space h if w a d and the set w a t has limit points both in the upper and lower open half plane then w a d and w a w a 1 1 the next statement also is an immediate consequence of corollary 1 we never theless state it as a theorem theorem 4 let a n k where n is normal and k is a compact operator on a hilbert space h if w a d and the intersection t w a is infinite while ess a d then w a d proof indeed a satisfies the conditions of corollary 1 with t and so the inclusions in 2 1 turn into the equalities 3 proof of lemma 2 note that the essential spectrum is invariant under addition of compact sum mands and so ess a ess n the latter coincides with n from which the isolated eigenvalues of finite multiplicity were removed if a is compact that is n 0 then of course ess a 0 and condition ess a d holds so theo rem 1 is a particular case of theorem 4 which was derived in the previous section from lemma 2 on the other hand our proof of lemma 2 below follows the lines of gau wus proof of theorem 1 let da supw re e i a r where as usual rex denotes the her mitian part x x 2 of the operator x since da is the support function of the convex set w a condition w a d is equivalent to 3 1 da 1 r while the condition imposed on w a means that the set 3 2 ei da 1 is infinite consequently 6 observe now that for operators a of the form n k the essential spectrum coincides with their weyl spectrum a that is the set of for which a i is not a fredholm operator with index zero by berberian s spectral mapping theorem 1 theorem 3 1 for any normal operator t and a function f continuous on t f t f t since e i a e i n e i k is the sum of a normal and compact operator along with a we have ess re e i a re e i a re e i a re ess e i a re e i ess a so the condition ess a implies that 1 re z 1 a ess re z 1 a for all z in other words 1 is an isolated eigenvalue of re z 1 a of finite multiplicity when ever z as in 3 we now invoke 6 theorem 3 3 according to which the points z possess the following property there exists a neighborhood uz of such z and two possibly coinciding open analytic arcs j z z j 1 2 satisfying 3 3 w a uz 1 z 2 z w a 4 birbonshi spitkovsky and srivastava for z we have in addition that at least one of the arcs j z contains infinitely many points of the unit circle and thus lie in t say for definiteness 1 z t since d w a 1 z in fact the whole arc 1 z is a subset of implying that z is an interior point of so is not only closed but also open in and thus so as well inclusions 3 3 imply in particular that w a thus completing the proof 4 additional observations 1 as in 3 the results of section 2 remain valid with d and t replaced by an arbitrary elliptical disk and its boundary respectively in order to see that it suffices to consider a suitable affine transformation a a i of a in place of a itself 2 recall that theorem 4 is a generalization of theorem 1 from the case of compact a to a being the sum of a normal and compact summands under the additional condition ess a t the following examples show that merely the condition on ess a would not suffice example 1 consider the 2 by 2 matrix c 1 2 1 0 1 2 for which c 1 2 and w c is the closed disk e centered at 1 2 with the radius also equal 1 2 in particular 1 e d let now z be a countable subset of t and a z z zc for any 1 2 z we then have a i 1 z z z 2 1 z z 2 2 0 z 2 1 and so p a 1 2 z a 1 2 z 1 2 t implying that a is disjoint with t at the same time z w a conv ze z z d moreover by choosing z located on a sufficiently small arc it is possible to arrange for a sector in d disjoint with w a and having an opening arbitrarily close to example 2 let now s be a weighted shift that is sej sjej 1 where ej j 1 is an orhtonormal basis of h and sj is a bounded sequence it is well known and easy to see that both the numerical range w s and the spectrum s are invariant under rotation and depend only on the absolute values of sj and not their arguments so without loss of generality let us suppose that sj 0 being convex w s is then either an open or a closed circular disk while s is a naturally closed circular disk according to e g 5 problem 93 suppose in addition that the sequence sj is periodic say with the period r then w s is open 10 proposition 6 while its radius coinciding in this case with the numerical radius w s of the operator s is given by w s max r j 1 sjxjxj 1 xj r r j 1 x 2 j 1 xr 1 x 1 anderson s theorem revisited 5 9 theorem 1 in particular w s s 1 sr r on the other hand the spectral radius r s of s is the geometric mean r s 1 sr of the weights s 1 sr 8 corollary 2 so r s w s unless all the weights sj are the same by an appropriate scaling we may arrange for w s 1 and thus w s d 6 d in spite of s d being disjoint with t references 1 s k berberian the weyl spectrum of an operator indiana univ math j 20 529
