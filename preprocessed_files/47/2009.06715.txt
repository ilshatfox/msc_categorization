study the reconstruction of the measure problem romp for com muting 2 variable weighted shifts w when the initial data are given as the berger measure of the restriction of w to a canonical invariant subspace together with the marginal measures for the 0 th row and 0 th column in the weight diagram for w we prove that the natural necessary conditions are indeed sufficient when the initial data correspond to a soluble problem we give a concrete formula for the berger measure of w our strategy is to build on previous results for back step extensions and one step extensions a key new theorem

paper we will focus on the case of h 2 z 2 and t a 2 variable weighted shift w t 1 t 2 as is well known the subnormality of such pairs is characterized by the existence of a representing measure known as the berger measure of w for the family of moments of the pair of double indexed sequences we will solve the so called reconstruction of the measure problem romp when w admits partial berger measures more specifically when the restriction of w to a canonical invariant subspace of 2 z 2 is subnormal that restriction generates a finite family f of localized berger measures 1 p which satisfy natural compatibility conditions two other 1 variable berger measures and corresponding to the 0 th row and 0 th column in the weight diagram for w are assumed to be part of the initial data romp asks for necessary and sufficient conditions on the members of f for the subnormality of w when soluble one must also reconstruct the berger measure of w from f and the marginal measures and our main result theorem 6 5 gives a complete solution of romp in the case of canonical invariant subspaces besides their relevance for the construction of examples and counterexamples in hilbert space operator theory weighted shifts can also be used to detect properties such as sub normality via the lambert lubin criterion 10 12 a commuting pair t 1 t 2 of injective operators acting on a hilbert space h admits a commuting normal extension if and only if for every nonzero vector x h the 2 variable weighted shift with weights i j t i 11 t j 2 x t i 1 t j 2 x and i j t i 1 t j 1 2 x t i 1 t j 2 x has a normal extension for n n 0 z a bounded sequence of positive real numbers called weights let w 2 z 2 z be the associated unilateral weighted shift defined by w en nen 1 all n 0 where en n 0 is the canonical orthonormal basis in 2 z the moments of are given as k k 1 if k 0 20 2 k 1 if k 0 it is easy to see that w shift 0 1 is never normal and that it is hyponormal if and only if 0 1 we recall a well known characterization of subnormality for single variable weighted shifts due to c berger cf 1 ii 6 10 and independently established by r gellar and l j wallen 8 w is subnormal if and only if there exists a probability measure supported in 0 w 2 called the berger measure of w such that for k 1 k k tkd t 1 1 similarly consider double indexed positive bounded sequences k 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 z 2 k 1 k 2 z 2 z z and let 2 z 2 be the hilbert space of square summable complex sequences indexed by z 2 in a canonical way 2 z 2 is isometrically isomorphic to 2 z 2 z we define the 2 variable weighted shift 2 w t 1 t 2 by t 1 e k 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 e k 1 k 2 1 t 2 e k 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 e k 1 k 2 2 where 1 1 0 and 2 0 1 see figure 1 clearly t 1 commutes with t 2 if and only if k 1 k 2 1 k 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 2 k 1

due to the commutativity condition 1 2 k 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 can be computed using any nondecreasing path from 0 0 to k 1 k 2 see figure 1 right we also recall a well known characterization of subnormality for multivariable weighted shifts t t 1 tn 9 for simplicity we state it in the case n 2 w t 1 t 2 is subnormal if and only if there is a probability measure defined on the rectangle r 0 a 1 0 a 2

l 0 l k 0 and l k l 0 l k 0 our first main result is theorem 4 1 which extends the main result in 4 to the case of arbitrary subspaces l 0 and l k 0 that is given berger measures 0 and k 0 satisfying the compatibility condition 0 s kd 0 s t k 0 t d k 0 s t 2 1 then the subnormality of w is guaranteed once the natural necessary conditions given below hold i 1 t l 1 0 ii 1 sk l 1 k 0 iii k 0 1 sk k

th row is subnormal with 1 variable berger measure and iii w restricted to the 0 column is subnormal with 1 variable berger measure 4 our second main result is theorem 5 2 given the initial data and the natural necessary conditions for the subnormality of w are also sufficient the proof uses a new idea together with appropriate generalizations of results in 3 6 our third main result provides a complete solution of the reconstruction of the measure problem for canonical invariant subspaces we do this in section 6 briefly stated given a finite family of berger measures k associated with a canonical invariant subspace s satisfying natural compatibility conditions of the type described in 2 1 and given 1 variable marginal berger measures and the solubility of romp for w is fully determined by the solubility of the localized version of romp on the pair of subspaces lp and lq where p and q are two arbitrary lattice points in the so called foundation set of the subspace s once again the natural necessary conditions for the solubility of romp are sufficient 3 notation and preliminaries for the reader s convenience in this section we gather several well known auxiliary results which are needed for the proofs of the main results in this article we recall some auxiliary facts needed for the proof of our main results in the single variable case if w is subnormal with berger measure and if we let lj en n j denote the invariant subspace obtained by removing the first j vectors in the canonical orthonormal basis of 2 z then the berger measure of w lj is d j s sj j d

support the singleton set 0 in particular w is never subnormal when l 1 0 0 to check the subnormality of 2 variable weighted shifts we need to introduce some definitions definition 3 2 5 6 13 i let and be two positive measures on x r we say that on x if e e for all borel subset e x equivalently if and only if fd fd for all f c x such that f 0 on x ii let be a probability measure on x y with y r

given a measure on x y the marginal measure x is given by x 1 x where x x y x is the canonical projection onto x thus x e e y for every e x equivalently d x s y d s t observe that x is a probability measure whenever is the following result is a very special case of the reconstruction of the measure prob lem lemma 3 3 subnormal backward extension of a 2 variable weighted shift 5 consider the 2 variable weighted shift whose weight diagram is given in figure 1 i assume that t l 0 1 is subnormal with associated measure 0 1 and that w 0 shift 00 10 is subnormal with associated measure then t is subnormal if and only if i 1 t l 1 0 1 ii 200 1 t l 1 0 1 1 iii 200 1 t l 1 0 1 0 1 ext t x moreover if 200 1 t l 1 0 1 1 then 0 1 ext t x in the case when t is subnormal the berger measure of t is

measure it is easy to see that the expression 1 t l 1 0 1 0 1 ext t is equivalent to the expression 0 1 t we will often use the latter expression for example lemma 3 3 iii can be rewritten as 200 0 1 t x recall that given two positive measures and on r is said to be absolutely continuous with respect to in symbols if e 0 e 0 for every borel set e on r given a 2 variable weighted shift t w such that t 1 t 2 t 2 t 1 and ti is subnormal i 1 2 and given k 1 k 2 0 we let wk 2 shift 0 k 2 1 k 2 3 3 be the k 2 th horizontal slice of t 1 with associated berger measure k 2 similarly we let vk 1 shift k 1 0 k 1 1 3 4 be the k 1 th vertical slice of t 2 with associated berger measure k 1 clearly w 0 and v 0 are the unilateral weighted shifts associated with the 0 th row and 0 column in the 6 weight diagram for t resp lemma 3 5 6 theorem 3 1 let be the berger measure of a subnormal 2 variable weighted shift and let resp be the berger measure of the associated 0 th horizontal resp vertical

convenience throughout the paper we adopt the convention of denoting r r by x y with independent variables s x and t y consistent with this the marginal berger measures are denoted by or d s and or d t we have found that doing so keeps a clear distinction at the level of berger measures and marginal measures between the two components t 1 and t 2 of w 4 generalized one step reconstruction of the measure problem in 4 theorem 1 7 we solved the reconstruction of the measure problem romp for 2 variable weighted shifts w under the assumption of subnormality for the restrictions w l 1 0 and w l 0 1 together with a natural compatibility condition that is if 1 0 and 0 1 are the respective berger measures of the restrictions then s d 0 1 s t t d 1 0 s t for some 0 see figure 3 left as mentioned in 4 remark 3 4 the proof of that result showed that using the same techniques one can solve a slightly more general reconstruction of the measure problem as follows we now state the more general result but we leave the details to the reader theorem 4 1 generalized one step extension cf 4 remark 3 4 consider the romp in figure 3 left and let k 0 and 0 be the berger measures of the restrictions of w to l k 0 and l 0 respectively assume that s k d 0 s t t d k 0 s t where k 0 0 0 then w is subnormal with berger measure if and only if i 1 t l 1 0 ii 1 sk l 1 k 0 iii k 0 1 sk l 1 k 0 0 1 sk l 1 k 0 1 and iv 0 y d 0 s t t 1 sk l 1 k 0 d 0 s sk y d k 0 s t d 0 s in the case when w is subnormal the berger measure of w is given by d s t 0 d 0 s t t d s 0 y d 0 s t t d 0 t 7 5 two step extensions we will now pose and solve the romp when even less information is available problem 5 1 for k 0 consider the canonical invariant subspace l k see figure 3 right when k 1 l 1 1 is the core of w assume that i w l k is subnormal with two variable berger measure ii w l 1 0 is subnormal with one variable berger measure and iii w l 0 1 is subnormal with one variable berger measure find necessary and sufficient conditions on and such that w is subnormal when w is indeed subnormal find its berger measure in terms of the initial data and 0 0 k 0 k 1 0 k 2 0 0 0 1 0 2 l k 0 l 0 the measures 0 and k 0 satisfy the compatibility condition in l k 0 0 k 0 k 1 0 k 2 0 0 0 1 0 2 represents w on l 0 l k 0 represents w on 0 th row represents w on 0 th column figure 3 left the subspaces l 0 l k 0 and l k l 0 l k 0 used in theorem 4 1 right initial data of two step romp for the subspace l k our strategy for solving problem 5 1 is to build an equivalent problem whose solution can be found using theorem 4 1 to this end consider the two closed subspaces l k 0 and l 0 we focus first on l k 0 and look for necessary conditions for the subnormality of w l k 0 from lemma 3 3 it is clear that for to extend to the berger measure of w l k 0 we need i 1 t l 1 as a simple application of lemma 3 3 times reveals similarly we must require the conditions ii k k 0 1 t 1 l 1 and 8 iii k y d s t t skd s again by repeated application of lemma 3 3 and the fact that the subnormal unilateral weighted shift associated with the sequence k 0 k 1 0 has berger measure s k properly normalized cf 3 1 it now follows that w l k 0 is subnormal if and only if i ii and iii hold and in that case the berger measure is reconstructed using lemma 3 3 as d k 0 s t k k 0 d s t t skd s k 0 k k 0 y d s t t d 0 t 5 1 observe that the measure inside the square brackets is a one variable measure in s having dealt with the subspace l k 0 it is now straightforward to list the necessary and sufficient conditions for w to be subnormal on the subspace l 0 these are i 1 sk l 1 ii k 0 1 sk 1 l 1 and iii k x d s t sk t d t when these conditions hold w l 0 is subnormal with berger measure given by d 0 s t k 0 d s t sk d 0 s t d t 0 k 0 x d s t sk 5 2 with the measure inside the square brackets a one variable measure in t we are now ready to state and prove a solution to problem 5 1 theorem 5 2 let w t 1 t 2 be a commuting 2 variable weighted shift and let k 0 assume that the unilateral weighted shifts corresponding to the 0 th row r 0 and the 0 th column c 0 are subnormal with berger measures and respectively as sume also that w l 0 l k 0 is subnormal with berger measure then w is subnormal with berger measure if and only if nc 1 1 skt l 1 nc 2 k 0 x d s t sk d t t d t 0 nc 3 k k 0 y d s t t d k s skd s k 0 nc 4 x y d s t skt 1 k when w is subnormal the berger measure is given by d s t k d s t skt d s k y d s t skt d 0 t d 0 s d t k x d s t skt 5 3 9 or in the equivalent succinct form k skt k y skt 0 0 k x skt 5 4 remark 5 3 observe that each of the one variable measures inside the parentheses in 5 4 is positive by nc 3 and nc 2 respectively as a result the berger measure is the sum of three positive measures involving the initial data and together with the marginal measures x and y proof of theorem 5 2 we wish to apply the natural generalization of lemma 3 3 when the subspace m is replaced by l k 0 it is straightforward to list the three required conditions i 1 t l 1 ii k k 0 1 t l 1 1 iii k k 0 y d s t t d k s observe first that nc 1 implies that both 1 sk and 1 t belong to l 1 for instance 1 t sk 1 skt and sk l thus the first hypothesis in lemma 3 3 is satisfied to get ii we integrate nc 3 with respect to s that is k k 0 x y d s t t x d k t x skd s k 0 it follows that k k 0 1 t l 1 k 0 k 0 1 as desired we now observe that iii and nc 3 are identical having verified i ii and iii we conclude that admits a back step extension k 0 to the subspace l k 0 in a completely similar way we use nc 1 and nc 2 to obtain a back step extension of denoted 0 to the subspace l 0 we now refer to the hypotheses for theorem 4 1 for the case of two subspaces l k 0 and l 0 and berger measures k 0 and 0 respectively first we need to check the compatibility condition skd 0 s t t d k 0 s t with k 0 0 by 5 2 we have skd 0 s t k 0 d s t skd 0 s d t k 0 x d s t k 0 d s t on the other hand by 5 1 t d k 0 s t k 0 d s t k 0 0 d s k k 0 x d s t t d 0 t k 0 d s t it is now clear that the compatibility condition holds we now calculate the l 1 norms of 1 t and 1 sk using 5 2 and 5 1 respectively in each case we use nc 4 in the last step 10 x y 1 t d 0 s t k 0 x y d s t skt x d 0 s y d t 0 k 0 y x d s t skt 1 0 and x y 1 sk d k 0 s t k k 0 x y d s t skt x d s k 0 k k 0 x y d s t skt y d 0 t 1 k 0 moreover 0 1 sk l 1 k 0 k 0 1 k 0 1 finally we need to check condition iv in theorem 4 1 0 y d 0 s t t 1 sk l 1 k 0 d 0 s sk y d k 0 s t d 0 s in preparation for this we first calculate the two integrals on the left hand side of iv observe that y d 0 t k 0 y d s t skt d 0 s y d t 0 k 0 y x d s t skt k 0 y d s t skt the last step uses both the fact that is a probability measure and condition nc 4 and as a result the quantity in square brackets is 0 similarly y d k 0 s t k 0 k y d s t t skd s k 0 k 0 k y d s t t y d 0 t skd s k 0 we are now ready to establish iv 0 y d 0 s t t 1 sk l 1 k 0 d 0 s sk y d k

we now know that w is subnormal to complete the proof we need to explicitly compute its berger measure 11 by theorem 4 1 using the subspace l 0 the measure 0 and the moment 0 we can reconstruct the berger measure of w as 0 0 t 0 y 0 t 0 now observe that 0 y d 0 s t t k y d s t skt d 0 s 1 k y x d s t skt k y d s t skt using nc 4 to obtain the last equality then 0 0 t k y skt 0 we now use 5 2 to obtain k d skt 0 k x d sk k y skt t 0 as desired 6 romp for canonical invariant subspaces let p z 2 be such that p z 2 p and let lp be the closed subspace of 2 z 2 generated by the orthonormal basis vectors ek where k p the subspace lp is invariant under t 1 and t 2 for any 2 variable weighted shift w t 1 t 2 definition 6 1 a set p such that p z 2 p is said to be full a closed subspace s of 2 z 2 invariant under t 1 and t 2 is said to be canonical if s lp for some full set p remark 6 2 typical examples of full and non full sets are given in figure 4 observe that for any nonempty set p z 2 the set p z 2 is full observe also that any full set p is the union of the full sets k z 2 where k is a point in p in symbols p k p k z 2 thus lp k p l k cf the left diagram in figure 4 as a consequence if p and q are full sets and if lp lq then p q with slight abuse of notation we will often write lk instead of l k definition 6 3 let p be a full set in z 2 amongst all subsets q of p satisfying q z 2 p there is a smallest one i e one that is contained in any other subset r of p such that r z 2 p we will call this minimal set the foundation of p and denote it by f p we now define s p to be the unique nonincreasing path contained in p and including all points in f p remark 6 4 i the points of f p are characterized by the following property k f p if and only k p k 1 p and k 2 p ii for p a full set observe that f p is always a finite set and that f p s p p by definition also f p z 2 s p z 2 p iii it is easy to see that s p can be represented by a descending staircase for a visual 12 depiction see the green staircase in the left diagram of figure 4 iv to list the points in s p we will follow the descending staircase from left to right that is p p 1 p 2 will come before q q 1 q 2 if and only if p 1 q 1 and p 2 q 2 v if p is full one can recover p from s p by selecting all points in z 2 which are located above and to the right of the descending staircase representing s p 0 0 1

blue disk denotes a point in p a red square denotes a point not in p and a blue square denotes a point in f p consider now a 2 variable weighted shift w and a canonical invariant subspace s which is necessarily of the form lp for some p full let f p be the foundation p it follows that s k f p lk assume noww lk is subnormal it immediately follows that for each k f p the restriction of w to the subspace lk must be subnormal now it is clear that w lk is a 2 variable weighted shift so it has a berger measure which we will denote by k thus the subnormality of w lp translates into the existence of a finite family of berger measures k one for each point k f p there is a compatibility condition however if we consider two points p q f p we know that the intersection of the canonical invariant subspaces lp and lq is l max p 1 q 1 max p 2 q 2 without loss of generality assume that p 1 q 1 and q 2 p 2 then r lp lq l q 1 p 2 by 3 1 the berger measure of w r is given by two expressions namely p 1 p 2 q 1 p 2 sq 1 p 1 p 1 p 2 and q 1 q 2 q 1 p 2 tp 2 q 2 q 1 q 2 13 therefore as a necessary condition for the solubility of romp we must require p 1 p 2 q 1 p 2 sq 1 p 1 p 1 p 2 q 1 q 2 q 1 p 2 tp 2 q 2 q 1 q 2 that is ps q 1 p 1 p qt p 2 q 2 q 6 1 we will denote by pq the berger measure of w restricted to lp lq similarly we will let p 1 and q 2 denote the restrictions of to lp 1 2 z and to lq 2 2 z respectively with the above mentioned compatibility condition in mind we are ready to state and prove the solution of romp for arbitrary canonical invariant subspaces theorem 6 5 let w be a 2 variable weighted shift let lp be a canonical invariant subspace and assume that w lp is subnormal let f p be the foundation of p with points listed in descending staircase order and let k k f p be the finite family of berger measures for the restrictions of w to the subspaces lk k f p suppose that the compatibility condition 6 1 holds for every p q f p in addition let and be the berger measures of the 0 th row and 0 th column in the weigh diagram of w the following statements are equivalent i w is subnormal ii for every p q f p the romp with initial data pq p 1 and q 2 is soluble iii for every consecutive pair of points p q f p in the descending staircase order the romp with initial data pq p 1 and q 2 is soluble iv for every p q f p with p 1 6 q 1 and p 2 6 q 2 the romp with initial data pq p 1 and q 2 is soluble proof looking at the staircase diagram in figure 4 left we can easily see that four basic and distinct descending staircase types for f p arise we exhibit these types in figures 5 and 6 we now analyze romp for each descending staircase type type i s p 0 z 6 and s p z 0 we refer the reader to the left staircase in figure 5 and recall that we denote arbitrary points in z 2 as k k 1 k 2 observe that the points p q r determine a weight diagram as in the generalized one step extension case of romp theorem 4 1 as a result assuming that the natural necessary conditions for solubility are satisfied we can extend pr to the subspace l p 1 r 2 we therefore reduce the original romp to a new romp whose descending staircase starts at p 1 r 2 and continues with the points s t u and v the situation is then almost identical to what we had before so with the natural necessary conditions for solubility and using theorem 4 1 once again we extend the measure to the subspace l p 1 t 2 this yields a new descending staircase connecting p 1 t 2 to u and v another application of theorem 4 1 leads to an extension to the subspace l p 1 v 2 to finish we now use the back step extension result lemma 3 3 applied p 2 times type ii s p 0 z and s p z 0 6 this case is completely analogous to the previous one so after successive instances of 14 0 0 k 0 p q r s t u v t 1 t 2 t 1 0

the 2 variable weighted shifts for type iii left and type iv right theorem 4 1 we end up with the subspace l p 1 0 and we then apply lemma 3 3 p 1 times to obtain the berger measure of w 15 type iii s p 0 z 6 and s p z 0 6 here repeated application of theorem 4 1 does the job type iv s p 0 z and s p z 0 in this case and after a few instances of theorem 4 1 we end up with the subspace l p 1 t 2 this case fits well within the scope of theorem 5 2 as a result the natural necessary conditions are sufficient for the existence of the berger measure the proof is now complete references 1 j conway the
