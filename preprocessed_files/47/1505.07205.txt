mathematical foundation of quantum physics one of the first important steps in this topic was to develop the theory of normal operators to which many famous mathematicians contributed including for instance d hilbert and j von neumann the main result concerning this class of operators is the well known spectral theorem which gives us a very useful model of normal operators this theorem was proven by von neumann in the 20 th century this is in fact the right generalization of the finite dimensional spectral theorem which was proven first by a l cauchy in the 19 th century in view of this theory we have a very powerful tool if we would like to deal with normal operators on the other hand the theory of non normal operators is not very well developed however many results have been obtained in the second half of the 20 th century one of the main methods of examining non normal operators acting on a complex hilbert space is the theory of contractions we say that a bounded linear operator t b h is a contraction if t 1 is satisfied where b h denotes the set of bounded operators acting on the complex hilbert space h this area of operator theory was developed by b sz nagy and c foias from the dilatation theorem of sz nagy what we state now theorem 1 1 sz nagy s dilation theorem 45 let us consider a contraction t b h there exists a larger hilbert space k h and a unitary operator acting on it such that t n phu n h holds for all n n where ph b k denotes the orthogonal projection onto h in this case we call u a unitary dilation of t 2 1 introduction 3 moreover there is a minimal unitary dilation in the sense that n z unh k is fulfilled and such a minimal dilation is unique up to isomorphism this u is called the minimal unitary dilation of t sz nagy and foias classified the contractions according to their asymptotic behaviour this classification can be done in a more general setting namely when we consider the class of power bounded operators an operator t b h is called power bounded if sup t n n n holds we call a vector x h stable for t if limn t nx 0 and the set of all stable vectors is denoted by h 0 h 0 t it can be derived quite easily that h 0 is a hyperinvariant subspace for t see 23 which means that h 0 is a subspace that is invariant for every operator which commutes with t therefore we will call it the stable subspace of t the natural classification of power bounded operators given by sz nagy and foias is the following t is said to be of class c 1 or asymptotically non vanishing if h 0 t 0 t is said to be of class c 0 or stable if h 0 t h i e when t n 0 holds in the strong operator topology sot t is said to be of class c j j 0 1 whenever t is of class cj the class cjk j k 0 1 consists of those operators that are of class cj and c k simultaneously we will use the notation t cjk h j k 0 1 trivially if t c 0 h c 1 h c 0 h c 1 h then t has a non trivial hyper invariant subspace namely h 0 t or h 0 t sz nagy and foias got strong structural results in the case when t c 11 h see 23 47 however basic questions are still open e g the hyperinvariant and the invariant subspace problems in the remaining cases i e when t c 00 h c 10 h c 01 h our aim in this dissertation is to explore the asymptotic behaviour of power bounded operators then we will present some applications namely we will investigate similarity to normal operators the commutant of non stable contractions and cyclic properties of a recently introduced operator class the weighted shift operators on directed trees 1 introduction 4 sz nagy characterized those operators that are similar to unitary operators this theorem belongs to the best known results concerning the study of hilbert space operators that are similar to normal operators the result is very elegant and in its original form reads as follows theorem 1 2 sz nagy 46 an operator t is similar to a unitary operator if and only if it is invertible and both t and t 1 are power bounded the direction is a trivial assertion in order to verify the other direction sz nagy defined a positive operator using banach limits in an ingenious way in what follows we will give this definition the banach space of bounded complex sequences is denoted by n we call the linear functional l n c x xn n 1 7 l lim n xn a banach limit if the following four conditions are satisfied l 1 we have l limn xn limn xn for convergent sequences l is positive i e if xn 0 for all n n then l limn xn 0 and l is shift invariant i e l limn xn l limn xn 1 note that a banach limit is never multiplicative see 7 section iii 7 for further details we would like to point out that sz nagy was the first who effectively applied the notion of banach limits before that it was considered only as a mathematical curiosity for a power bounded t b h let us consider the sequence of self adjoint iterates t nt n n 1 and fix a banach limit l we consider the sesqui linear form wt l h h c wt l x y l lim n t nt nx y which is bounded and positive hence there exists a unique representing positive operator at l b h such that wt l x y at lx y x y h the operator at l is called the l asymptotic limit of the power bounded operator t which usually depends on the particular choice of l it is quite straightforward to show that kerat l h 0 t is satisfied for every banach limit l sz nagy showed that if t and 1 introduction 5 t 1 are both power bounded then at l is invertible and there exists a unitary operator u b h such that a 1 2 t lt ua 1 2 t l in the case when t is a contraction the sequence of self adjoint iterates t nt n n 1 is evidently decreasing thus it has a unique limit at a b h in sot which is clearly positive this positive operator is said to be the asymptotic limit of the contraction t which of course coincides with the l asymptotic limit of t for every l the l asymptotic limit gives us information about the asymptotic behaviour of the orbits t nx n 1 namely l lim n t nx 2 a 1 2 t lx 2 a 1 2 t ltx 2 x h 1 1 there is a certain reformulation of theorem 1 2 which reads as follows see 31 theorem 1 3 sz nagy consider an arbitrary operator t b h and fix a banach limit l the following six conditions are equivalent i t is similar to a unitary operator ii t is onto and similar to an isometry iii t is power bounded and there exists a constant c 0 for which the inequalities t nx c x and t nx c x hold for every n n and x h iv t is onto power bounded and there exists a constant c 0 for which the inequality t nx c x holds for every n n and x h v t is power bounded and the l asymptotic limits at l and at l are invertible vi t has bounded inverse and both t 1 and t are power bounded moreover if we have an arbitrary power bounded operator t b h then the next three conditions are also equivalent i t is similar to an isometry ii there exists a constant c 0 for which the inequality t nx c x holds for every n n and x h iii the l asymptotic limit at l is invertible sz nagy s method naturally leads us to a little bit more general definition the so called isometric and unitary asymptote of a power bounded operator we consider the operator 1 introduction 6 x t l b h h t where h t ranat l kerat l h 0 and x t lx a 1 2 t lx holds for every x h since x t ltx x t lx is satisfied x h there exists a unique isometry vt l b h t such that x t lt vt lx t l holds the operator vt l or sometimes the pair vt l x t l is called the isometric asymptote of t let wt l b ht l be the minimal unitary dilation of vt l andxt l b h ht l xt lx x t lx for every x h obviously we have xt lt wt lxt l the operator wt l or sometimes the pair wt l xt l is said to be the unitary asymptote of t we note that a more general definition can be given however we will only need these canonical realizations see 3 these asymptotes play an important role in the hyperinvariant subspace problem similarity problems and operator models see e g 3 5 10 24 25 32 33 48 when t c 1 h c 0 h we have the following result which was first proven by sz nagy and foias for contractions and by l ke rchy for power bounded operators lemma 1 4 ke rchy 25 consider a power bounded operator t c 1 h c 0 h and the orthogonal decomposition h h 0 h 0 the block matrix form of t in this decomposition is the following t t 0 r 0 t 1 b h 0 h 0 1 2 where the elements t 0 and t 1 are of class c 0 and c 1 respectively this is a very important structural result which will be applied several times through out this dissertation the outline of the dissertation is as follows in chapter 2 we characterize those positive operators a b h that arise from a contraction asymptotically i e there is such a contraction t b h for which at a then in chapter 3 we give a description of those positive semi definite matrices a b cd which arise from a power bounded matrix asymptotically i e there exists a power bounded matrix t b cd and a banach limit l such that at l a holds in fact we show that the matrices at l coincide for every l moreover we will describe this operator as the limit of the cesa ro sequence of the self adjoint iterates of t chapter 4 is devoted to the generalization of theorem 1 2 concerning power bounded operators that are similar to normal operators this gives us a method in certain cases which helps us to decide whether a given operator is similar to a normal 1 introduction 7 one then as a strengthening of sz nagy s result for contractions we will describe those positive operators a that arise from a contraction t that is similar to a unitary operator in chapter 5 we will investigate the case when the so called commutant mapping of a contraction which is a transformation that maps the commutant of a contraction into the commutant of its unitary asymptote is injective finally we will prove some cyclicity results in chapter 6 concerning weighted shift operators on directed trees which were recently introduced by z j jab lonski i b jung and j stochel in 22 in each chapter there is a separate section for the main statements of our results and motivation and another which is devoted to the proofs chapter 2 positive operators arising asymptotically from contractions 1 statements of the main results this chapter contains our results published in 15 throughout the chapter if we do not state otherwise it will be assumed that t b h is a contraction the main aim is to characterize those positive operators on a hilbert space of arbitrary dimension which arise asymptotically from contractions the following information concerning the asymptotic limits were known before or are trivial see e g 31 48 i 0 at i ii ker at h 0 t x h limn t nx 0 is a hyperinvariant subspace iii ker at i h 1 t x h limn t nx x is the largest invariant subspace where t is an isometry iv at 0 if and only if t c 0 h v 0 p at if and only if t c 1 h we note that h 1 t h 1 t is the subspace on which the unitary part of t acts moreover we provide the following further information about at theorem 2 1 suppose l is a banach limit and t is a power bounded operator for which at l 6 0 holds then we have at l 1 2 1 in particular at 1 holds whenever t is a contraction in finite dimension the asymptotic limit is always idempotent the verification of this can be done with the jordan decomposition theorem as well but we will use the sz nagy foias langer decomposition instead theorem 2 2 let t b cd be a contraction then at a 2 t at i e at is simply the orthogonal projection onto the subspace h 0 t and h 0 t h 0 t is satisfied 8 1 statements of the main results 9 we say that the positive operator a b h arises asymptotically from a contraction in uniform convergence if limn t nt n a 0 of course in this case a at on the other hand it is easy to see that usually for a contraction t b h the equation limn t nt n at holds only in sot whenever dimh at arises from t in uniform convergence since the sot is equivalent to the usual norm topology the sym bols e and re denote the essential spectrum and the essential spectral radius see 7 section xi 2 our result concerning the separable and infinite dimensional case reads as follows theorem 2 3 let dimh 0 and a be a positive contraction acting on h the following four conditions are equivalent i a arises asymptotically from a contraction ii a arises asymptotically from a contraction in uniform convergence iii re a 1 or a is a projection of finite rank iv dimh 0 1 dimh 1 holds for every 0 1 where h denotes the spectral subspace of a associated with the borel subset r moreover if one of these conditions holds and dim ker a i 0 0 then t can be chosen to be a c 0 contraction such that it satisfies ii we will also give the characterization in non separable spaces but before that we need a generalization of the essential spectrum if is an infinite cardinal number satisfying dimh then the closure of the set e s b h dim r s is a proper two sided ideal denoted by c let f b h c be the quotient algebra the mapping b h f be the quotient map and the quotient norm on f for an operator a b h we use the notations a a a a and r a r a for 0 we get the ideal of compact operators a 0 a e is the essential norm 0 a e a and r 0 a re a for more details see 11 or 35 now we state our result in the non separable case theorem 2 4 let dimh 0 and a b h be a positive contraction then the following four conditions are equivalent i a arises asymptotically from a contraction ii a arises asymptotically from a contraction in uniform convergence 2 proofs 10 iii a is a finite rank projection or dimh 0 1 0 and r a 1 holds iv dimh 0 1 dimh 1 for any 0 1 moreover when dim ker a i 0 and i holds then we can choose a c 0 contrac tion t such that a is the uniform asymptotic limit of t the main tool in the proof of the above theorem is the following well known property any vector h h generates a separable reducing subspace t j 1 t k 1 t jlt klh l n 0 j 1 k 1 jl kl n 0 for t therefore h can be decomposed into the orthogonal sum of separable reducing subspaces h h and so t t where t t h hence at is the orthogonal sum of asymptotic limits of contractions all acting on a separable space at at it is natural to ask what condition on two contractions t 1 t 2 b h imply at 1 at 2 or reversely what connection between t 1 and t 2 follows from the equation at 1 at 2 finally we will investigate this problem theorem 2 5 let h be an arbitrary hilbert space and t t 1 t 2 b h contractions the following statements are satisfied i if t 1 t 2 commute then at 1 t 2 at 1 and at 1 t 2 at 2 ii if u h is a non constant inner function and t is a c n u contraction then at au t iii at 1 at 2 a implies a at 1 t 2 iv if t 1 and t 2 commute and at 1 at 2 then we have at 1 t 2 at 1 at 2 we will conclude this chapter by providing some examples 2 proofs we begin with the proof of theorem 2 1 proof of theorem 2 1 assume that 0 at l happens set a vector v h v 1 and an arbitrarily small number 0 such that l lim n t nv 2 a 1 2 t lv 2 a 1 2 t l 2 2 proofs 11 is satisfied by 1 1 we get a 1 2 t l t kv t kv 2 a 1 2 t lv 2 t kv 2 a 1 2 t l 2 t kv 2 k n since lim infk t kv 2 l limk t kv 2 a 1 2 t l 2 for every 0 there exists a k 0 n for which t k 0 v 2 a 1 2 t l 2 holds this suggests that a 1 2 t l t k 0 v t k 0 v 2 a 1 2 t l 2 t k 0 v 2 a 1 2 t l 2 a 1 2 t l 2 since this holds for every 0 we infer that at l a 1 2 t l 2 a 1 2 t l 2 a 1 2 t l 2 in the beginning we could choose an arbitrarily small 0 hence we obtain 2 1 we proceed with the verification of theorem 2 2 proof of theorem 2 2 let us consider the sz nagy foias langer decomposition t u c b h n n where u b n is unitary and c b n is c n u if n h then obviously at at i therefore without loss of generality we may assume that this is not the case suppose that r c 1 then there exists a vector 0 6 v ker c i with a t we can find a 0 6 w ker c i because c is not unitary using the contractivity of c we obtain v 2 2 re v cw 2 cw 2 v cw 2 cv cw 2 v w 2 v 2 2 re v w 2 w 2 v 2 2 w 2 c or equivalently 0 2 w 2 cw 2 2 re v cw c in particular we derive the following inequality 0 t 2 w 2 cw 2 2 t v cw t r which implies v cw 0 therefore any eigenspace of c associated with a complex number of unit modulus has to be a reducing subspace which is impossible since c was c n u thus r c 1 follows and e g by gelfand s spectral radius formula 7 proposition 2 proofs 12 vii 3 8 we infer cn 0 hence we get n h 0 t h 0 t this implies that at i 0 at b n n is the orthogonal projection onto n h 0 our next goal is to prove theorem 2 3 but before that we need three auxiliary results the next lemma gives us some necessary conditions on the asymptotic limit of t lemma 2 6 if the positive operator 0 a i is the asymptotic limit of a contraction t then one of the following three possibilities occurs i a 0 ii a is a non zero finite rank projection h 0 t h 1 t and dimh 1 t n iii a re a 1 proof as we have already seen at 0 1 assume that i and iii do not hold then 1 is an isolated point of a and dim ker a i dimh 1 t n since t is an isometry on the finite dimensional invariant subspace h 1 t the contraction t must be unitary on h 1 t therefore h 1 t is reducing for t now consider the decomposition t t u where u t h 1 t evidently a at ih 1 t and at 0 1 holds which implies at 1 and thus at 0 therefore h 0 t h 1 t so a is a projection onto h 1 now we would like to point out some remarks it is easy to see that in a triangular decomposition t t 1 t 12 0 t 2 b h h at at 1 at 2 does not hold in general a counterexample can be given by the contractive bilateral weighted shift operator defined by tek ek 1 for k 01 2 ek 1 for k 0 2 2 where ek k z is an orthonormal basis in h indeed an easy calculation shows that at ek ek for k 0 1 2 2 k 2 ek for k 0 2 proofs 13 on the other hand h 1 t k 0 ek and the matrix of t is t t 1 t 12 0 t 2 in the decomposition h 1 t h 1 t here t 2 c 0 h 1 t so at 1 at 2 i 0 is a projection but at is not in fact at is a projection if and only ifh h 0 t h 1 t happens 31 section 5 3 in this case h 0 t is a reducing subspace of t if t has only trivial reducing subspaces dimh 2 and at is a projection then either t is stable or t is a simple unilateral shift operator i e all weights are 1 in 2 2 this follows directly from the previous remark theorem 1 3 and the neumann wold decomposition of isometries 23 p 204 obviously for each power bounded operator t b h and unitary operator u b h we have autu l uat lu 2 3 we proceed with the proof of the following lemma which provides a sufficient condition for any positive operator a b h we shall write r a for the minimal element of a 0 lemma 2 7 suppose that the block diagonal positive contraction a j 0 aj b h j 0 xj has the following properties i dimxj dimx 0 0 for every j ii r aj r aj 1 for every j iii a 1 is invertible and iv r aj 1 then a arises asymptotically from a c 0 contraction in uniform convergence proof let us consider the following operator weighted unilateral shift operator s b h which is given by the equation s x 0 x 1 x 2 0 u 0 x 0 u 1 x 1 xj xj 2 proofs 14 where uj xj xj 1 are unitary transformations i e bijective isometries j n 0 let t be defined by t xj a 1 2 j 1 sa 1 2 j j n 0 since a 1 2 j 1 sa 1 2 j xj 1 r aj 1 a 1 2 j xj r aj r aj 1 xj xj we obtain that t is a contraction of class c 0 an easy calculation shows that t nt n j 0 a 1 2 j s na 1 j ns na 1 2 j by the spectral mapping theorem we get aj a 1 2 j s na 1 j ns na 1 2 j a 1 2 j ixj s na 1 j ns n a 1 2 j r a 1 j n ixj n 1 r aj n 1 1 r an 1 this yields t nt n a sup aj a 1 2 j s na 1 j ns na 1 2 j j n 0 1 r an 1 0 n which ends the proof the last lemma before verifying theorem 2 3 reads as follows lemma 2 8 let a be a positive diagonal contraction on a separable infinite dimen sional hilbert space h suppose that the eigenvalues of a can be arranged into an increasing sequence j j 1 0 1 each listed according to its multiplicity such that j 1 then a is the uniform asymptotic limit of a c 0 contraction proof first we form a matrix l m l m n from the eigenvalues in the following way 1 1 1 2 1 2 and 1 2 3 3 1 4 2 2 5 and 1 3 6 and so on 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 2 1 2 2 2 3 3 1 3 2 4 1 1 3 6 10 2 5 9 4 8 7 2 proofs 15 we can choose an orthonormal basis el m l m n in h such that el m is an eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue l m of a now we form the subspaces xm el m l n m n which are clearly reducing for a for any m n we set am a xm let us consider also the operator s defined by sel m el m 1 l m n we note that s is the orthogonal sum of 0 many unilateral shift operators now the operator t b h is given by the following equality t xm a 1 2 m 1 sa 1 2 m m n since tel m l m l m 1 el m 1 l m n t is a c 0 contraction furthermore for every l m n n we have n l m n and so t nt nel m ael m l m l m n l m 1 n 1 0 n since el m is an eigenvector for both a and t nt n the sequence t nt n uniformly converges to a on h so a arises asymptotically from a c 0 contraction in uniform convergence now we are in a position to prove the characterization when dimh 0 this states that a positive contraction which acts on a separable space is an asymptotic limit of a contraction if and only if one of the conditions i iii of lemma 2 6 holds in what follows e stands for the spectral measure of the positive operator a and h e h for any borel subset r let us consider the orthogonal decomposition h hd hc reducing for a where a hd is diagonal and a hc has no eigenvalue let us denote the spectral measure of a hd and a hc by ed and ec respectively for any borel set r we shall write hc ec hc and hd ed hd proof of theorem 2 3 the implication i iii follows from lemma 2 6 and ii i is trivial first we prove the implication iii ii in order to complete the implication circle i iii ii i and second we show the equivalence iii iv iii ii we suppose that re a 1 if a is a finite rank projection then t a can be chosen if ker a 6 0 then a has the form a 0 a 1 in the decomposition h ker a ker a where re a 1 1 if a 1 arises asymptotically from the contraction 2 proofs 16 t 1 in uniform convergence then a arises asymptotically from 0 t 1 in uniform convergence hence we may assume that ker a 0 obviously one of the next three cases occurs case 1 there exists a strictly increasing sequence 0 a 0 a 1 a 2 such that an 1 and dimh an an 1 0 for every n n 0 if 1 is not an eigenvalue of a then lemma 2 7 can be applied so we may suppose that dim ker a i 1 in this case we have the orthogonal decomposition a a 0 a 1 where a 0 a ker a i and a 1 a ker a i again using lemma 2 7 we obtain a contraction t 0 b ker a i such that the uniform asymptotic limit of t 0 is a 0 choosing any isometry t 1 b ker a i a arises asymptotically from t t 0 t 1 in uniform convergence case 2 ker a i 0 and there is no strictly increasing sequence 0 a 0 a 1 a 2 such that an 1 and dimh an an 1 0 for every n n 0 if dimh 0 0 for each 0 1 then a is diagonal all eigenvalues are in 0 1 and have finite multiplicities therefore lemma 2 8 can be applied if this is not the case then there is a 0 b 1 which satisfies the following conditions dimh 0 b 0 and dimh b 0 for all b 1 we take the decomposition h h 0 b h b 1 where dimh b 1 0 obviously holds since 1 e a in order to handle this case we have to modify the argument applied in lemma 2 8 let us arrange the eigenvalues ofa in b 1 in an increasing sequence j j 1 each listed according to its multiplicity we form the same matrix l m l m n as in lemma 2 8 and take an orthonormal basis el m l m n in h b 1 such that each el m is an eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue l m of a let x 0 h 0 b and xm el m l n m n take an arbitrary orthonormal basis el 0 l 1 in the subspace x 0 we define the operator t by the following equation t xm a 1 2 m 1 sa 1 2 m xm m n 0 where am a xm and s b h sel m el m 1 l n m n 0 for a vector x 0 x 0 we have tx 0 a 1 2 1 sa 1 2 0 x 0 1 b a 1 20 x 0 x 0 therefore t is a contraction on x 0 but it is also a contraction on x 0 see the proof of lemma 2 8 and since tx 0 t x 0 it is a contraction on the whole h 2 proofs 17 we have to show yet that t nt n converges uniformly to a on x 0 for x 0 x 0 x 0 1 we get t nt nx 0 ax 0 a 1 2 0 s n a 1 n ixn s na 1 2 0 x 0 a 1 n ixn 1 n 1 0 so a arises asymptotically from t in uniform convergence case 3 dim ker a i 0 if dim ker a i 0 then we take the orthogonal decomposition h ker a i ker a i trivially 1 e a ker a i by cases 1 and 2 we can find a contraction t 0 b ker a i such that the uniform asymptotic limit of t t 0 iker a i is a if dim ker a i 0 and a 6 i then we consider an orthogonal decomposition ker a i j 1 xj where dimxj dim ker a i and apply lemma 2 7 if a i then just take an isometry for t iii iv if a is a projection then dim 1 is the rank of a for every 0 1 if 1 e a then dimh 1 0 holds for all 0 1 conversely if the quantity dimh 1 dimh 0 1 is finite 0 1 then obviously a is a projection of finite rank if this dimension is 0 then clearly 1 e a finally from the previous discussions we can see that if the equivalent conditions i iv hold then the contraction t inducing a can be chosen from the class c 0 provided dim ker a i n now we turn to the case when dimh 0 as was mentioned earlier for every contraction t b h the spaceh can be decomposed into the orthogonal sum of separable t reducing subspaces proof of theorem 2 4 we may suppose that a is not a projection of finite rank since t t where every t acts on a separable space the i iv part can be proven by theorem 2 3 straightforwardly the implication ii i is obvious first we will prove the direction iv ii and then the equivalence iii iv iv ii set dimh 0 1 which is necessarily infinite if 0 then applying theorem 2 3 we can get a as the uniform asymptotic limit of a contraction on kera we take the zero operator therefore we may suppose that 0 we may also assume that a is injective now we take an arbitrary strictly increasing sequence 0 a 0 a 1 a 2 2 proofs 18 such that limj aj 1 and let j dimh aj aj 1 for every j n 0 obviously j 0 j dimh 0 1 dimh 0 1 clearly one of the following four cases occurs case 1 j for infinitely many indices j then without loss of generality we may suppose that this holds for every index j by lemma 2 7 we can choose a contraction t 0 b h 0 1 such that t n 0 t n 0 a h 0 1 0 set the operator t t 0 v b h 0 1 h 1 where v b h 1 is an arbitrary isometry trivially t is a contraction with the uniform asymptotic limit a case 2 dimh 1 let us decompose h 1 into the orthogonal sum h 1 k 1 xk x where dimxk for every k n and dimx setting x 0 h 0 1 we may apply lemma 2 7 for the restriction of a to k 0 xk taking any isometry on x we obtain that ii holds case 3 dimh 1 and j for every j then clearly dimh 1 dimh 0 1 for any 0 1 joining subintervals together we may assume that 0 j j 1 holds for every j n 0 and supj 0 j let xj h aj aj 1 for every j n 0 obviously we can decompose every subspace xj into an orthogonal sum xj j k 0 xj k such that dimxj k k for every 0 k j then by lemma 2 7 we obtain a contraction tk b j k xj k such that the asymptotic limit of tk is a j k xj k in uniform convergence in fact from the proof of lemma 2 7 one can see that t nk t nk a j k xj k 1 an k 1 1 an 1 0 therefore if we choose an isometry v b h 1 we get that ii is satisfied with the contraction t k 0 tk v b h case 4 dimh 1 and j holds for finitely many j but at least for one we may assume 0 0 j j 1 for every j n and supj 1 j take an orthogo nal decompositionh 0 a 1 k 1 lk where dimlk k set also xj h aj aj 1 for every j n and take a decomposition xj j k 1 xj k such that dimxj k k for every 1 k j thus by lemma 2 7 we obtain a contraction tk b lk j k xj k 2 proofs 19 such that the asymptotic limit of tk is the restriction of a to the subspace lk j k xj k in uniform convergence as in case 3 we get ii iii iv since 1 r a a a 1 we have a 1 an application of 11 lemma 5 gives us dimh 1 0 1 iv iii we may assume that dimh 0 1 0 again applying 11 lemma 5 we get an 1 for all n n this means that r a 1 finally we notice that if dim ker a i n then we can choose a c 0 contraction the following corollary is a straightforward consequence in particular this corollary gives that whenever a is an asymptotic limit of a contraction then aq is also an asymptotic limit of a contraction for every 0 q corollary 2 9 suppose that the function g 0 1 0 1 is continuous increasing g 0 0 g 1 1 and 0 g t 1 for 0 t 1 if a arises asymptotically from a contraction then so does g a next we verify theorem 2 5 but before that we need the following lemma for every a d the function ba d d ba z z a 1 az is the so called mo bius transformation which is a special type of inner functions moreover it is a riemann mapping from d onto itself we use the notation ta ba t where we use the well known sz nagy foias functional calculus which is a contractive weak continuous algebra homomorphism t h b h such that t 1 i and t t z z is satisfied for further details see 48 it is easy to see that b a ta b a ba t b a ba t t lemma 2 10 for every c n u contraction t we have at ata proof consider the isometric asymptotes x t vt and x ta vta of t and ta re spectively obviously x t ba vt is a contractive intertwining pair for ta hence we have a unique contractive transformation z i vta ba vt and x t zx ta since atx x x t x x t x x t x 2 zx tax 2 x tax 2 atax x x h at ata follows therefore at ata a ta a at 2 proofs 20 now we are ready to prove theorem 2 5 proof of theorem 2 5 i for an arbitrary vector x h and i 1 2 we have at 1 t 2 x x lim n t 1 t 2 n t 1 t 2 nx x lim n t 1 t 2 nx 2 lim n t ni x 2 lim n t ni t n i x x atix x where we used the commuting property in the step t 1 t 2 n t n 1 t n 2 t n 2 t n 1 ii set a u 0 and v ba u then obviously v w where z z and w is an inner function from i and lemma 2 10 we get au t av t at we consider isometric asymptotes x t vt and x u t vu t of t and u t respectively the pair x t u vt is a contractive intertwining pair of u t using the universal property of the isometric asymptotes we get a unique contractive transformation z i vu t u vt and x t zx u t the last equality implies at au t and so at au t iii consider the isometric asymptotes x v 1 x v 2 and x t 1 t 2 w of t 1 t 2 and t 1 t 2 respectively where x x t 1 x t 2 obviously the pair x v 1 v 2 is a contractive intertwining pair for t 1 t 2 hence we get from the universality property of the isometric asymptote that there exists a unique contractive z i w v 1 v 2 and x zx t 1 t 2 therefore a at 1 t 2 iv this is an immediate consequence of i and iii for an alternative proof of ii above see 6 lemma iii 1 it can be also derived from 28 theorem 2 3 concluding this chapter we provide two examples first we give two contractions t 1 t 2 c 1 h such that at 1 at 2 and at 1 t 2 6 at 1 this shows that iii of theo rem 2 5 cannot be strengthened to equality even in the c 1 case by iv of theorem 2 5 these contractions do not commute 2 proofs 21 example 2 11 take an orthonormal basis ei j i j n inh the operators t 1 t 2 b h are defined in the following way t 1 ei j ei j 1 if j 1 j 2 1 j ei j 1 if j 1 t 2 ei j e 1 2 if i j 1 ei 1 j 1 if j 2 3 2 ei 1 j 2 if

power bounded matrices 1 statements of the main results this chapter is devoted to the characterization of all possible l asymptotic limits of power bounded matrices which was done in 16 throughout the chapter t b cd 2 d will always denote a power bounded matrix if we do not say otherwise the first important step towards the desired characterization is to show that banach limits can be replaced by usual limits if we consider cesa ro means of the self adjoint iterates of t theorem 3 1 let t b cd be power bounded then at l at c lim n 1 n n j 1 t jt j holds for all banach limits l we note that the above limit holds in norm since we are in finite dimensions concerning arbitrary dimensions if for an operator t b h the limit at c limn 1 n n j 1 t jt j exists in sot it will be called the cesa ro asymptotic limit of t in order to prove theorem 3 1 we will derive some properties of the jordan decomposition of t then we will give the characterization of c 11 matrices we would like to point out that any matrix is of class c 1 if and only if it is of class c 11 which happens exactly when it is similar to a unitary matrix this will follow from proposition 3 5 the characterization reads as follows in that case theorem 3 2 the following statements are equivalent for a positive definite a b cd i a is the cesa ro asymptotic limit of a power bounded matrix t c 11 cd 23 1 statements of the main results 24 ii if the eigenvalues of a are t 1 td 0 each of them is counted according to their multiplicities then 1 t 1 1 td d 3 1 holds iii there is an invertible s b cd with unit column vectors such that a s 1 s 1 ss 1 the proof of the general case uses the c 11 case lemma 1 4 and a block diagonalization of a special type of block matrices we shall call a power bounded matrix t b cd l stable 0 l d if dimh 0 l we will see later from proposition 3 5 that t and t are simultaneously l stable which is not true in infinite dimensional spaces simply consider a non unitary isometry in the forthcoming theorem the symbol il stands for the identity matrix on cl and 0 k b ck is the zero matrix theorem 3 3 the following three conditions are equivalent for a non invertible pos itive semidefinite a b cd and a number 1 l d i there exists a power bounded l stable t b cd such that at c a ii let k d l if t 1 tk denote the non zero eigenvalues of a counted with their multiplicities then 1 t 1 1 tk k iii there exists such an invertible s b cd that has unit column vectors and a s 1 il 0 k s 1 one could ask whether there is any connection between the cesa ro asymptotic limit of a matrix and the cesa ro asymptotic limit of its adjoint if t b cd is contractive then at at is valid see theorem 2 2 in the case of power bounded matrices usually the subspaces h 0 t and h 0 t are different and hence at and at are different too however we provide the next connection for c 11 class 2 2 power bounded matrices theorem 3 4 for each t c 11 c 2 the harmonic mean of the cesa ro asymptotic limits at c and at c are exactly the identity i i e a 1 t c a 1 t c 2 i 2 3 2 2 proofs 25 the proof relies on the fact that the inverse of a 2 2 matrix can be expressed with its elements rather easily the same method cannot be applied in higher dimensions moreover 3 2 is not even true in three dimensions any more this will be justified by a concrete 3 3 example 2 proofs we begin with the description of the jordan decomposition of power bounded matrices we recall that a jordan matrix is a matrix of the following form j j 1 0 0 0 j 2 0 0 0 j k where j has the following matrix entries j 1 0 0 0 0 0 by the jordan decomposition of a matrix t b cd we mean the product t sjs 1 where s b cd is invertible and j b cd is a jordan matrix see 41 recall that for any matrix b b cd the equation limn bn 0 holds if and only if r b 1 see e g 31 proposition 0 4 the symbol diag expresses a diagonal matrix written in the standard orthonormal base proposition 3 5 suppose t b cd is power bounded and let us consider its jordan decomposition sjs 1 then we have j u b with a unitary u diag 1 k b ck k n 0 and a b b cd k for which r b 1 conversely if j has the previous form then necessarily t is power bounded 2 proofs 26 proof for the first assertion let us consider the block decomposition of j j j 1 jk where jj is a j jordan block it is clear that power boundedness is preserved by similarity since jnj j 1 0 0 0 j 1 0 0 0 j 0 0 0 0 j n nj n n 1 j n 2 n 2 j 0 nj n n 1 j 0 0 nj 0 0 0 nj 3 3 holds we obtain that if is an eigenvalue of t then either 1 or 1 and the size of any corresponding jordan block is exactly 1 1 on the other hand if j u b then it is obviously power bounded and hence t is power bounded as well next we prove that the cesa ro asymptotic limit of t always exists moreover it can be expressed as the cesa ro asymptotic limit of another matrix t which is obtained by replacing the above matrix b with 0 theorem 3 6 let t b cd be power bounded and by using the notations of propo sition 3 5 let us consider the matrices j u 0 and t sj s 1 then the cesaa ro asymptotic limit of t and t exist and they coincide at c at c 3 4 conversely if the sequence 1 n n j 1 t jt j n 1 converges for a matrix t then it is neces sarily power bounded 2 proofs 27 proof for the first part let us consider the following 1 n n j 1 t jt j 1 n n j 1 t jt j 1 n s 1 n j 1 j js sj j n j 1 j js sj j s 1 s 1 1 n n j 1 0 b js s 0 b j 1 n n j 1 u 0 js s 0 b j 1 n n j 1 b 0 js s u 0 j s 1 3 5 since limj 0 b j 0 we obtain that 3 4 holds whenever at least one of the limits exists now we consider the partial sums 1 n n j 1 t jt j it is easy to see that multiplying from the right by a diagonal matrix acts as multiplication of the columns by the corresponding diagonal elements similarly for the multiplication from the left action this holds with the rows we have the next equality j js sj j se 1 2 n 2 1 n se 1 se 2 nm 1 n se 1 sem 0 0 n 1 2 n se 2 se 1 se 2 2 nm 2 n se 2 sem 0 0 n 1 m n sem se 1 n 2 m n sem se 2 sem 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 6 since lim n 1 n n j 1 j limn n 1 n 1 0 if 1 6 1 for 1 the above limit is 1 and multiplying by a fix matrix does not have an effect on the fact of convergence we can easily infer that the right hand side of 3 4 exists and hence 3 4 is verified for the reverse implication let us assume that 1 n n j 1 t jt j n 1 converges and as in the statement of theorem 3 1 let us denote its limit by at c according to the following 2 proofs 28 equation a 1 2 t ch at ch h 1 2 lim n 1 n n j 1 t jh 2 1 2 and because of uniform convergence there exists a large enough m 0 such that 1 n n j 1 t jh 2 1 n n j 1 sj js 1 h 2 m holds for each unit vector h cd since s is bounded from below the above inequality holds exactly when 1 n n j 1 j jh 2 m holds for every unit vector h cd with a large enough bound m 0 on the one hand this implies that r j r t 1 on the other hand if there is an at least 2 2 jordan block in j where 1 then this above inequality obviously cannot hold for any unit vector see 3 3 this ensures the power boundedness of t let us point out that if a sequence of matrices sn n 1 is entry wise l convergent then l lim n xsn x l lim n sn and l lim n snx l lim n sn x hold this can be easily verified from the linearity of l now we are ready to prove theorem 3 1 proof of theorem 3 1 the equality l limn n l limn n holds for ev ery 1 which gives us l limn n 0 for all 6 1 1 the banach limit is trivially 1 if 1 now if we take a look at equation 3 6 we can see that at l at c holds for every banach limit since 0 b js s 0 b j 0 u js s 0 b j b 0 js s 0 u j 0 the equation chain at l at l at c at c is yielded 2 proofs 29 a natural question arises here when does the sequence t nt n n 1 converge the forthcoming theorem is dealing with this question where we will use a theorem of g corach and a maestripieri theorem 3 7 the following statements are equivalent for a power bounded t b cd i the sequence t nt n n 1 b cd is convergent ii the eigenspaces of t corresponding to eigenvalues with modulus 1 are mutually orthogonal to each other moreover the following three sets coincide a b cd t b cd power bounded such that a lim n t nt n p p b cd p b cd p 2 p a b cd positive semidefinite a 0 1 dim ker a ranke 1 3 7 where e denotes the spectral measure of a proof the ii i implication is quite straightforward from 3 6 for the reverse direction let us consider 3 6 again this tells us that if l 6 k then sel sek has to be 0 which means exactly the orthogonality in order to prove the further statement we just have to take such a t that satisfies ii since the limit of t nt n n 1 exists if and only if the sequence t nt n n 1 converges by a similar reasoning to the beginning of the proof of theorem 3 6 we consider t nt n s 1 j ns sj n s 1 trivially we can take an orthonormal basis in every eigenspace as column vectors of s and if we do so then the column vectors of s corresponding to modulus 1 eigenvalues will form an orthonormal sequence and the other column vectors i e the zero eigenvectors will form an orthonormal sequence as well but the whole system may fail to be an orthonormal basis this implies that lim n t nt n s 1 i 0 s 1 s 1 i 0 s s i 0 s 1 by 8 theorem 6 1 we get 3 7 2 proofs 30 next we prove theorem 3 2 proof of theorem 3 2 i iii let us suppose that t sus 1 holds with an invertible s b cd and a unitary u diag 1 d of course it can be supposed without loss of generality that s has unit column vectors this is just a right choice of eigenvectors moreover if an eigenvalue has multiplicity more than one then the corre sponding unit eigenvectors as column vectors in s can be chosen to form an orthonormal base in that eigenspace trivially this does not change t now considering 3 6 we get 1 n n j 1 u js su j i and therefore at c s 1 s 1 iii i take an s such that it has unit column vectors if we put j s to be pairwise different in u and t sus 1 then we obviously get at c s 1 s 1 from equation 3 6 iii ii by the spectral mapping theorem we have d tr s s tr ss d j 1 1 tj ii iii it would be enough to find such a unitary matrix u b cd which satisfies diag 1 t 1 1 td uej 1 indeed if we chose s diag 1 t 1 1 td u ss would become diag 1 t 1 1 td and 2 3 would give what we wanted the idea is that we put such complex numbers in the entries of u that have modulus 1 d because then the column vectors of s will be unit ones and we only have to be careful with the orthogonality of the column vectors of u in fact the right choice is to consider a constant multiple of a vandermonde matrix u j 1 k 1 d d j k 1 2 proofs 31 where e 2 i d we show that its column vectors are orthogonal to each other which will complete the proof for this we consider j 1 6 j 2 j 1 j 2 1 2 d and the inner product uej 1 uej 1 d k 1 j 1 1 k 1 d j 2 1 k 1 d 1 d d k 1 j 1 j 2 k 1 0 this shows that u is indeed unitary in order to handle the non c 11 case we will use a reversal of lemma 1 4 this reversal statement reads as follows lemma 3 8 suppose that the matrix t b cd has the block matrix upper triangular representation as in lemma 1 4 with respect to an orthogonal decomposition cd h h such that t 0 c 0 h r b h h is arbitrary and t 1 c 1 h then necessarily t is power bounded and its stable subspace is precisely h proof by an easy calculation we get t n t n 0 rn 0 t n 1 where rn n j 1 t n j 0 rt j 1 let us assume that t n 0 t n 1 r m is satisfied for each n n in order to see the power boundedness of t one just has to use that t n 0 rn holds for large n s with a number r 1 since we are in a finite dimensional space it is quite straightforward that h h 0 t and since for any vector x h the sequence t n 1 x n 1 does not converge to 0 then neither does t nx n 1 consequently we obtain that h h 0 t the above proof works for those kind of infinite dimensional operators as well for which r t 0 1 is satisfied however we note that in general it is not valid now we are in a position to show the characterization in the non c 11 case proof of theorem 3 3 the equivalence of i and iii can be handled very simi larly as in theorem 3 2 2 proofs 32 i ii let us write t 0 r 0 e 0 re 0 e e c 11 ck for the adjoint of a power bounded matrix up to unitarily equivalence which is general enough for our purposes see theorem 3 6 and lemma 3 8 since e is invertible it is equivalent to investigate the two forms above from the equation t nt n 0 re n 0 e n 0 0 enr en re nenr re nen e nenr e nen we get at c rae cr rae c ae cr ae c calculating the null space of at c suggests that for the block diagonalization we have to take the following invertible matrix x il r r ik il rr 1 2 0 0 ik r r 1 2 the inverse of x is precisely x 1 il rr 1 2 0 0 ik r r 1 2 il r r ik which implies that x is unitary with a straightforward calculation we derive x 1 at cx 0 l ik r r 1 2 ae c ik r r 1 2 here ik r r 1 2 ik q holds with a positive semi definite q for which rank q l holds and conversely every such ik q can be given in the form ik r r 1 2 therefore the set of all cesa ro asymptotic limits of l stable power bounded matrices again up to unitarily equivalence are given by 0 l ik q ae c ik q q b ck positive semidefinite rank q l e c 11 ck and every positive operator of the above form is the cesa ro asymptotic limit of an l stable power bounded matrix 2 proofs 33 finally let us write ik q 2 u diag q 1 qk u and u a 1 e cu i j k i j 1 where u is unitary and qj 1 for each 1 j k therefore 1 t 1 1 tk tr ik q 1 a 1 e c ik q 1 tr a 1 e c ik q 2 tr u a 1 e cu diag q 1 qk k j 1 qj j j tr a 1 e c k is fulfilled for each l stable power bounded matrix t ii i set some positive numbers t 1 tk such that 1 t 1 1 tk k is valid if we take such a 0 c 1 for which 1 c t 1 1 t 2 1 tk k then obviously a diag c t 1 t 2 tk arises as the cesa ro asymptotic limit of a power bounded operator from c 11 ck therefore if we take the rank one q diag 1 c 1 0 0 positive semi definite matrix we get ik q a ik q diag t 1 t 2 tk this ends the proof next we prove our formula concerning 2 2 matrices proof of theorem 3 4 let t s diag 1 2 s 1 with 1 2 1 and s b c 2 be invertible for which the column vectors are unit ones we have learned from the proof of theorem 3 2 that in this case a 1 t c ss happens the matrix s can be written in the following form s 1 1 s 1 2 t 2 1 1 s 2 2 2 1 t 2 where j l 1 j l 1 2 and s t 0 1 provided that the above matrix is invertible 2 proofs 34 by taking diag 1 1 1 1 2 1 s instead of s and using 2 3 we can see that without loss of generality 1 1 2 1 1 can be assumed so we have s s 1 2 t 1 s 2 2 2 1 t 2 and thus a 1 t c ss s 2 t 2 s 1 s 2 t 1 t 2 22 12 s 1 s 2 t 1 t 2 22 12 2 s 2 t 2 finally since t s 1 diag 1 2 s and we have s 1 1 s 1 t 2 22 t 1 s 2 12 1 t 2 22 1 s 2 t 12 s we immediately obtain a 1 t c 1 t 2 22 1 s 2 t 12 s 1 t 2 22 t 12 1 s 2 s 2 s 2 t 2 s 1 s 2 t 1 t 2 22 12 s 1 s 2 t 1 t 2 22 12 s 2 t 2 which implies 3 2 in the proof we used that the inverse of a 2 2 matrix can be expressed quite nicely as we mentioned earlier the above theorem cannot be generalized in higher dimensions in fact when dimh 0 then we can get counterexamples quite easily let us consider a weighted bilateral shift operator which has weights 1 everywhere except for one weight which is 1 2 this trivially defines a contraction moreover at and at are invertible which implies that t is similar to a unitary however at at i at 6 i and at 6 i which implies a 1 t a 1 t 2 i but a 1 t a 1 t 6 2 i in the matrix case we do not have such an easy counterexample however simple computations tell us that usually 3 2 does not hold even for 3 3 matrices for example if we consider t i 2 1 0 1 i 1 0 4 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 i i 2 1 0 1 i 1 0 4 1 2 proofs 35 then the eigenvalues of a 1 t c a 1 t c are approximately 1 27178 2 1285 and 2 59972 finally we give some examples first we provide such a power bounded weighted shift operator t for which the l asymptotic limit really depends on the choice of the particular banach limit l moreover the cesa ro asymptotic limit of t exists we will use a characterization from 34 of all the possible banach limits of a bounded real sequence namely g g lorentz proved that for every x real sequence the equality l lim n xn l l q x q x r holds where l stands for the set of all banach limits and q x inf lim sup k 1 p p j 1 xnj k p n n 1 np n q x sup lim inf k 1 p p j 1 xnj k p n n 1 np n example 3 9 let us fix an orthonormal basis ej j n and define t in the following way tej 2 ej 1 j 3 l for some l n 1 2 ej 1 j 3 l l for some l n ej 1 otherwise since t n 2 holds for each n n t is power bounded a rather easy calculation shows that the equation t nt ne 1 2 e 1 3 l n 3 l l for some l n e 1 otherwise is valid therefore by lorentz s characterization we get at le 1 e 1 l l 1 2 it is quite easy to see that the sequence t nt n n 1 consists of diagonal operators with respect to our fixed orthonormal basis a straightforward computation gives us at c i the last two examples concern the existence of the cesa ro asymptotic limit and power boundedness from these examples we will see that none of the mentioned properties concerning t implies the other one 2 proofs 36 example 3 10 we define t with the equation tej 2 ej 1 j 3 l for some l n 1 2 ej 1 j 2 3 l for some l n ej 1 otherwise clearly t nt ne 1 2 e 1 3 l n 2 3 l for some l n e 1 otherwise holds the cesa ro means of the sequence t nt ne 1 e 1 n n does not converge hence the the cesa ro asymptotic limit of t cannot exist on the other hand t n 2 is satisfied for every n n thus t is power bounded example 3 11 our shift operator is defined as follows tej 2 ej 1 3 l j 3 l l for some l n ej 1 otherwise on the one hand it is not power bounded because t n 2 n on the other hand it is not hard to see that at c exists and it is precisely the identity operator chapter 4 asymptotic limits of operators similar to normal operators 1 statements of the results the present chapter contains our results from 17 first we will give a generalization of the necessity part in sz nagy s similarity result theorem 1 2 and 1 3 let us consider a normal power bounded operator n b h since r n n r nn nn holds n n we obtain that n is a contraction a quite straightforward application of the functional model of normal operators see 7 chapter ix gives us that an ih 0 n 0 h 0 n holds where n ranan is the unitary part of n in view of theorem 1 3 it is reasonable to conjecture that when a power bounded operator t is similar to a normal operator then at l ranat l should be invertible indeed this is the case as we shall see from the forthcoming theorem but before stating it we need some definitions we recall that if the operator a b h is not zero then the reduced minimum modulus of a is the quantity a inf ax x kera x 1 in particular if a is a positive operator then a 0 holds exactly when a rana is invertible our first result concerns two similar power bounded operators and it reads as follows theorem 4 1 let us consider two power bounded operators t s c 0 h which are similar to each other then at l 0 holds for some and then for all banach limits l if and only if as l 0 is valid moreover at l 0 holds if and only if the powers of t are bounded from below uniformly on h 0 t i e there exists a constant c 0 such that c x t nx x h 0 t n n in particular if t is similar to a normal operator then at l 0 and at l 0 are satisfied the proof of theorem 4 1 will use lemma 1 4 this theorem can be considered as a generalization of the necessity part in sz nagy s theorem and it can help in deciding 37 2 proofs 38 whether an operator is similar to e g a normal operator in some cases however the last point of theorem 4 1 is clearly not reversible which can be seen by easy counterexamples for instance set an arbitrary operator b b h with r b 1 and consider t b i b h h on the one hand t is usually not similar to any normal operators but on the other hand at 0 i which implies at 1 as we have seen sz nagy s theorem says that at l is invertible when t is similar to a unitary if t is a contraction then we can state more than simply the invertibility of at namely we will prove the following statement where i is only an implications statement but ii is an if and only if one we recall that the minimal element of the spectrum of a self adjoint operator a is denoted by r a theorem 4 2 i let dimh and t b h be a contraction which is similar to a uni tary operator then dim ker at r at i 0 consequently the condition r at e at holds ii let dimh 0 a b h be a positive invertible contraction and suppose that the conditions 1 e a and dim ker a r a i 0 0 are fulfilled then there exists a contraction t b h which is similar to a unitary operator and the asymptotic limit of t is exactly a this theorem can be considered as a strengthening of the necessity part in sz nagy s similarity theorem in particular in the separable case it provides a characterization of asymptotic limits for those contractions which are similar to unitary operators we note that it is an open problem to describe the l asymptotic limits of those operators that are similar to unitary operators and act on infinite dimensional spaces 2 proofs in order to prove theorem 4 1 we need two lemmas the first one reads as follows lemma 4 3 consider a power bounded operator t c 0 h then the following con ditions are equivalent i the inequality at l 0 is satisfied for some and then for all banach limits l 2 proofs 39 ii the compression t 1 p 1 t h 0 is similar to an isometry where p 1 denotes the orthogonal projection onto the subspace h 0 iii the powers of t are bounded from below uniformly on h 0 i e there exists a constant c 0 such that c x t nx is satisfied on h 0 for all n n proof i ii we will use the decomposition at l 0 a 1 b h 0 h 0 where a 1 is obviously invertible consider the isometric asymptote x t l vt l if we restrict the equation vt lx t l x t lt 4 1 to the subspace h 0 we get the following vt la 1 2 1 vt lx t l h 0 x t lt h 0 a 1 2 1 t 1 which verifies that the operator t 1 is indeed similar to the isometry vt l ii iii by lemma 1 4 we have t n t n 0 0 t n 1 therefore by sz nagy s theorem there exists a constant c 0 for which t nx t n 1 x c x n n x h 0 iii i let x h 0 be arbitrary then we have a 1 2 t lx 2 l lim n t nx 2 c 2 x 2 which means exactly that a 1 2 t l c and hence at l c 2 0 is satisfied we proceed with the following technical lemma lemma 4 4 consider an orthogonal decomposition h k l and an invertible operator x b h suppose that the block matrix of x is x x 11 x 12 0 x 22 b k l 2 proofs 40 and the element x 11 b k is surjective then the elements x 11 b k and x 22 b l are invertible and the block matrix form of x 1 is the following x 1 x 111 x 111 x 12 x 122 0 x 122 b k l proof let x 1 y 11 y 12 y 21 y 22 b k l since x is invertible x 11 has to be injective thus bijective the 2 1 element of the block matrix decomposition of x 1 x i is y 21 x 11 0 b k l which gives us y 12 0 the 2 2 elements of xx 1 i and x 1 x i are x 22 y 22 il and y 22 x 22 il respectively which imply the invertibility of x 22 b l finally an easy calculation verifies the block matrix form of x 1 now we are in a position to present our generalization of sz nagy s theorem proof of theorem 4 1 we begin with the first part let x b h be an invert ible operator for which s xtx 1 holds it is easy to see that h 0 s xh 0 t which gives us dimh 0 t dimh 0 s and dimh 0 t dimh 0 s therefore we can choose a unitary operator u b h such that the equation h 0 t uh 0 s uxh 0 t h 0 usu 4 2 is valid by 2 3 it is enough to prove the inequality ausu l 0 now consider the block matrix decompositions 1 2 and ux y 11 y 12 0 y 22 b h 0 t h 0 t the latter one is indeed upper block triangular and moreover the element y 11 is surjective because of 4 2 therefore by lemma 4 4 we obtain the equation ux 1 y 111 y 111 y 12 y 122 0 y 122 b h 0 t h 0 t an easy calculation gives the following p 1 usu h 0 t p 1 ux t ux 1 h 0 t y 22 t 1 y 122 2 proofs 41 where p 1 denotes the orthogonal projection onto the subspace h 0 t now if the inequality at l 0 holds then by lemma 4 3 the operator t 1 is similar to an isometry but this gives that the compression p 1 usu h 0 t is also similar to an isometry and hence by lemma 4 3 and 4 2 we get that as l 0 holds the second part was proven in lemma 4 3 the third part is an easy consequence of the fact that the asymptotic limit of a power bounded normal operator n is always idempotent next we prove a consequence of theorem 4 1 we recall definitions of some special classes of operators to which the similarity will be investigated in the forthcoming corollary the operator t b h is said to be of class q if tx 2 1 2 t 2 x 2 x 2 holds for every x h log hyponormal if log t t log tt is satisfied an operator t is called paranormal if tx 2 t 2 x x is valid for all x h it is quite easy to verify from the arithmetic geometric mean inequality that every paranormal operator is of class q as well we say that the operator t has the putnam fuglede property or pf property for short if for any operator x b h k and isometry v b k for which tx xv holds the equation t x xv is satisfied as well corollary 4 5 for a power bounded operator t b h and a banach limit l the following implications are valid i if t c 0 h is similar to a power bounded operator that has the pf property then the condition at l 0 is fulfilled ii if t c 0 h is similar to an operator that is either log hyponormal or of class q or paranormal then the inequality at l 0 is satisfied proof theorem 3 2 of 39 tells us that the pf property for a power bounded opera tor t is equivalent to the condition that t is the orthogonal sum of a unitary and a power bounded operator of class c 0 therefore i is an easy consequence of pagacz s result and theorem 4 1 if t is log hyponormal then mecheri s result see 36 implies that t has the pf property and thus at l 0 holds 2 proofs 42 finally let us assume that t is a power bounded operator which also belongs to the class q we prove that then it is a contraction as well if tx 2 x 2 a 0 held for a vector x h then we would obtain t 2 x 2 tx 2 tx 2 x 2 a by induction we could prove that t n 1 x 2 t nx 2 a would hold for every n n therefore the inequality t n 1 x 2 x 2 n a would be true which would imply that t could not be power bounded consequently t has to be a contraction p pagacz showed that a contraction which belongs to the class q shares the pf property see 40 and 38 for the paranormal case this gives us that at l 0 is valid which completes our proof next an application of the above results will be presented it is easy to see that if the weighted bilateral shift operator t with weights wk k z c is power bounded then the l asymptotic limit satisfies the equation at lek l limn n j 0 wk j 2 ek for every k z a weighted bilateral shift operator t is power bounded if and only if the inequality sup n j 0 wk j k z n n 0 is fulfilled see 44 proposition 2 by sz nagy s theorem t is similar to a unitary operator exactly when it is power bounded and in addition the following holds inf n j 0 wk j k z n n 0 0 corollary 4 6 let i be an arbitrary set of indices consider the orthogonal sum w i iwi b i ihi which is power bounded and each summand wi is a weighted bilateral shift operator that is similar to a unitary operator if w is similar to a normal operator then necessarily it is similar to a unitary operator proof let us denote the l asymptotic limit of wi by ai since the subspaces hi are invariant for the operators w nw n i i n n we obtain the equation aw l i iai since each summand wi is similar to a unitary operator the operator ai is invertible and a 1 2 i wi sia 1 2 i holds for every i i where si denotes a simple i e unweighted bilateral shift operator from the power boundedness of w sup ai i i follows on the one hand if sup a 1 i i i is satisfied then w i iai 1 2 i isi i iai 1 2 2 proofs 43 gives that w is similar to a unitary operator on the other hand if the inequality fails then aw l i iai is not invertible but injective by theorem 4 1 we obtain that in this case w cannot be similar to any normal operator our proof is complete we continue with the verification of i in theorem 4 2 point ii will be proven later proof of i in theorem 4 2 sinceat is invertible the inequality r r at 0 is satisfied it is trivial that if r 1 then at i and in this case the statement of the theorem is obviously true therefore we may suppose that r 1 we will use the notationm ker at ri assume that the condition 0 dimm holds if we set an arbitrary vector h m then we have r 1 2 h a 1 2 t h a 1 2 t t 1 h r 1 2 t 1 h 4 3 which implies that the inequality t 1 h h is fulfilled for any h m but t is a contraction therefore t 1 h h for every h m because of the latter equation and 4 3 we deduce a 1 2 t t 1 h r 1 2 t 1 h h m which implies that the finite dimensional subspace m is invariant for the operator t 1 since t is bijective we get that t 1 m m is satisfied and the restriction t m is unitary since t is a contraction and dimm these imply that m is reducing for t on the other hand ri m at m i m follows which is a contradiction before proving ii of theorem 4 2 we need the following lemma we note that the method which will be used here is similar to the one which was used in section 2 there operator weighted unilateral shift operators were used and here we use operator weighted bilateral shift operators this will result in some further complications lemma 4 7 suppose we have a positive invertible contraction a b h an orthogo nal decomposition h k yk where the subspaces yk are reducing for a and a unitary operator u b h such that the following conditions hold i the equation uyk yk 1 is satisfied for all k z ii we have limk r a yk 1 and iii the inequality a 1 2 yk a 1 2 uyk is fulfilled for every k z and yk yk then t a 1 2 ua 1 2 b h is a contraction for which at a holds 2 proofs 44 proof by iii we obtain t yk a 1 2 u a 1 2 yk a 1 2 uu a 1 2 yk yk which gives that t is indeed a contraction consider an arbitrary vector yk yk k z the following inequality holds for any 0 choosing n large enough t nt nyk ayk a 1 2 u n a 1 i una 1 2 yk a 1 2 a 1 i yk n a 1 2 yk yk this shows that t nt nyk ayk holds for every vector yk yk and number k z but yk is reducing for the operator t nt n k z n n which implies at a finally we present our proof concerning ii in theorem 4 2 proof of ii in theorem 4 2 part i we will assume in this part that ker a i 0 holds first we choose an ar bitrary two sided sequence ak k z r 1 for which the conditions ak ak 1 k z limk ak r and limk ak 1 are valid we will use the notations xk h ak ak 1 k z and m ker a ri where h denotes the spectral subspace of a associ ated with the borel subset r there are five different cases which will be considered separately case i 1 when k 0 dimxk 0 k 0 dimxk 0 0 holds choosing a subsequence if necessary we may suppose that dimxk 0 is valid for every k z on the one hand if additionally m 0 is satisfied then using lemma 4 7 we get what we wanted on the other hand if dimm 0 then we choose an orthonormal base ek 1 k in m set yk xk c ek if k 0 xk elsewhere and choose an arbitrary unitary operator u such that uyk yk 1 k z and uek 1 ek k 0 hold then again we use lemma 4 7 2 proofs 45 case i 2 when k 0 dimxk 0 0 k 0 dimxk 0 is valid we can assume without loss of generality that the condition dimxk 0 is satisfied exactly when k 0 we choose an orthonormal base ek l k 0 l 0 in h a 0 1 such that every vector ek l is an eigenvector of a associated with the eigenvalue k l and the equation k l k 1 l holds for every k 0 l 0 this can be obviously done since 1 e a set yk ek l l 0 if k 0 and for k 0 in the same way as in the previous case bearing in mind whether m 0 or not now if we choose such a unitary operator u b h for which point i of lemma 4 7 and the equation uek 1 ek k 0 hold we can easily complete this case case i 3 when k 0 dimxk 0 0 k 0 dimxk 0 is true we may suppose that the equation dimxk 0 holds if and only if k 0 the restriction a h r a 0 is trivially diagonal and trivially acts on an infinite dimensional subspace since r e a therefore we can choose an orthonormal base ek l k l 0 which consists of a eigenvectors aek l k lek l such that the inequality k 1 l k l is fulfilled for all k l 0 if we have yk ek l l 0 if k 0 xk elsewhere and a unitary operator u b h such that the equations uyk yk 1 k z and uek 1 l ek l k 0 are satisfied then again by lemma 4 7 we easily complete this case case i 4 when 0 k z dimxk 0 0 is fulfilled without loss of generality we may suppose that the equation dimxk 0 is true exactly when k 0 obviously both of the restrictions a h r a 0 and a h a 1 1 are diagonal operators and are acting on infinite dimensional subspaces we choose orthonormal bases ek l k 0 l z and ek l k 0 l z in the subspaces h r a 0 and h a 1 1 respectively such that aek l k lek l holds for some positive numbers k l k l z k 6 0 and k l k l is valid for arbitrary integers k k l for which k 6 0 k 6 0 k k now if yk x 0 if k 0 ek l l z if k 6 0 2 proofs 46 and u b h is a unitary operator such that uyk yk 1 k z and uek 1 l ek l k 0 k 1 are satisfied then again we can use lemma 4 7 in order to complete this case case i 5 when dimxk 0 is fulfilled for all k z we can use a very similar argument as in the previous case therefore we omit the details part ii in this part we assume that dim ker a i 0 it is easy to see that exactly one of the equations ker a i h and dim ker a i 0 holds because r e a is valid it is also quite obvious that if t b h and t b h are two contractions such that both of them are similar to a unitary operator then t t b h h is also a contraction that is similar to a unitary operator and we have at t at at case ii 1 when either a i or 1 e a ker a i if a i then we simply set t i if the relation 1 e a ker a i holds then by part i we can choose a contraction t b ker a i that is similar to a unitary operator and for which at a ker a i holds if t t i b ker a i ker a i we get at a case ii 2 when dim ker a i 0 and 1 e a ker a i obviously the conditions dim ker a i 0 and r a ker a i 1 hold consider a sequence ak 0 k r r a ker a i such that ak 1 ak k 0 a 0 r a ker a i and limk ak r are satisfied set xk h ak ak 1 k 0 if the equation dimxk 0 holds for infinitely many k 0 then we may assume that it holds for every k 0 assume first that this happens then we simply choose yk xk k z where ker a i k 0 xk dimxk 0 k 0 and we use lemma 4 7 in fact this is the case when the scalar valued spectral measure of a ker a i is continuous i e there are no atoms second we suppose that the equation dimxk 0 holds only for finitely many numbers k 0 we consider the decomposition ker a i ka kc where both of the subspaces ka and kc are a invariant and the scalar valued spectral measure of the restrictions a ka and a kc are purely atomic and continuous respectively if kc 6 0 then we choose a splitting ker a i l 1 l 2 where diml 1 diml 2 0 holds by the previous paragraph there is a contraction t b l 1 kc which is similar to a unitary operator 2 proofs 47 and for which at a l 1 kc holds this shows that it is enough to consider the case when a is diagonal if a is diagonal then the eigenvalues counting with their multiplicities k l k l z can be easily ordered in a way such that k l k 1 l l k z and k l 1 k l z k 0 hold now if we choose yk ek l l z and define the unitary operator u b h by the equation uek l ek 1 l k l z then by a straightforward application of lemma 4 7 our proof is completed chapter 5 injectivity of the commutant mapping 1 statements of the results throughout this chapter t always denotes a contraction given any c t there exists exactly one d wt such that xtc dxt this enables us to define the commutant mapping t of t in the following way t t wt c 7 d such that xtc dxt it can be shown that is a contractive algebra homomorphism see 48 section ix 1 for further details this commutant mapping is among the few links which relate the con traction to a well understood operator it can be exploited to get structure theorems or stability results see e g 1 26 27 29 30 hence it is of interest to study its properties our purpose in 14 was to examine the injectivity of and in this chapter we give the results obtained in that publication if t is asymptotically non vanishing then xt and hence t are clearly injective a natural and non trivial question is that if the commutant mapping is injective is necessarily t of class c 1 however this is not true a counterex ample will be given which will justify it but before that we will prove the next two results the first one provides four necessary conditions for injectivity for a contraction t let p 0 denote the orthogonal projection onto the stable subspace the compressions p 0 t h 0 and i p 0 t h 0 are denoted by t 00 and t 11 respectively theorem 5 1 if the commutant mapping of the contraction t b h is injective then i i t 11 t 00 0 ii ap t 00 ap t 11 6 iii p t p t d and iv there is no direct decomposition h m 0 um 1 such that m 0 m 1 are invariant subspaces of t and 0 6 m 0 h 0 48 1 statements of the results 49 in view of condition iii of the previous theorem it is of interest to express the point spectra of t and t in terms of the matrix entries we will give such a result as proposition 5 6 for an operator a on a hilbert space f and for a complex number the root subspace of a corresponding to is defined by k er a i j 1 ker a i j we say that the operator a has a generating root subspace system if f k er a i p a our second result is about sufficiency namely it shows that under certain circum stances iii of theorem 5 1 is sufficient for the injectivity of theorem 5 2 let us assume that the stable component t 00 of the contraction t satisfies the following conditions i p t 00 p t 00 ii t 00 has a generating root subspace system then is injective if and only if p t p t d we recall that a c n u contraction t is called a c 0 contraction if there exists a function h such that t 0 if i e where i and e are the inner and outer part of respectively then i t 0 it can be shown that here exits an inner function t h such that t t 0 and whenever h t 0 holds the function is a multiple of t this t is called the minimal function of t the conditions of the previous theorem are satisfied in a large class of c 0 contractions corollary 5 3 let us assume that the stable component t 00 of the contraction t is a c 0 contraction and the minimal function of t 00 is a blaschke product then is injective if and only if p t p t d after that we will be able to present our example for a non c 1 contraction which has injective commutant mapping this will be followed by investigating the injectivity of commutant mappings for quasisimilar contractions and orthogonal sum of contractions two operators a b b h are quasisimilar if the quasiaffinities i e operators with trivial kernel and dense range x i a b and y i a b exist we say that t b h is in stable relation with t b h if c i t t and ranc h 0 t imply c 0 and if c i t t and ranc h 0 t imply c 0 our result concerning quasisimilar contractions and orthogonal sum of contractions reads as follows 2 proofs 50 theorem 5 4 let t b h and t b h be contractions i if t and t are quasisimilar then t is injective if and only if t is injective ii the commutant mapping t t is injective if and only if t and t are injective and t is in stable relation with t iii assuming t t the commutant mapping t t is injective if and only if t is injective in particular if the contraction t b h is quasisimilar to a normal operator n b g then t is injective if and only if t is of class c 11 we would like to point out that ii iii of the above theorem can be extended quite easily for orthogonal sum of countably many contractions we also note that the injectivity of t and t does not imply the injectivity of this will be verified by a concrete example finally using certain properties of shift operators we will provide an example for which i iv of theorem 5 1 are satisfied but still t is not injective this shows that these four conditions together are not enough to provide a characterization of injectivity of t 2 proofs suppose that is injective and consider a c t such that ranc h 0 then 0 x 0 xc c x implies c 0 whence c 0 follows second if is not injective then c 0 for some non zero c t and xc c x 0 x 0 yields ranc h 0 therefore is injective if and only if the only operator in t whose range is included in the stable subspace h 0 is the zero operator in particular if t c 0 then 0 is highly non injective while t c 1 evidently yields that is injective therefore we are interested in the mixed case 0 6 h 0 6 h throughout this chapter we will use lemma 1 4 many times but here we will use the following more convenient notation t t 00 t 01 0 t 11 b h 0 h 0 now we prove the following lemma lemma 5 5 the commutant mapping is injective if and only if the conditions t 00 c 01 c 01 t 11 c 00 t 01 and c 00 t 00 5 1 2 proofs 51 imply c 00 0 and c 01 0 proof the range of any operator c b h is included in h 0 precisely when its matrix is of the form c c 00 c 01 0 0 b h 0 h 0 furthermore the equation ct tc reduces to the equations c 00 t 00 t 00 c 00 and c 00 t 01 c 01 t 11 t 00 c 01 thus by the observations of the first paragraph the proof is complete now we are in a position to give the verification of theorem 5 1 proof of theorem 5 1 taking any c 01 i t 11 t 00 the condition 5 1 is ful filled with c 00 0 hence i must hold if is injective if ii fails then the mapping t b b h 1 h 0 defined by t y 7 t 00 y y t 11 is surjective see 9 thus 5 1 can be satisfied with c 00 i and c 01 t 1 t 01 and so is not injective if iii fails then there exist d and unit vectors u v h such that tu u and t v v then ran u v cu h 0 and u v t u t v u v u v t u v hence cannot be injective finally if iv fails then the projection p onto m 0 parallel to m 1 commutes with t and is transformed to zero by as we mentioned before by iii of theorem 5 1 it is of interest to express the point spectra of t and t in terms of the matrix entries the next proposition is about that problem proposition 5 6 for any d we have i p t if and only if p t 00 ii p t if and only if p t 11 or t 01 ker t 00 i 0 t 11 i h 0 6 proof i let h h 0 h 1 h 0 h 0 be a non zero vector the equation th h holds exactly when t 00 h 0 t 01 h 1 h 0 and t 11 h 1 h 1 since p t 11 d it follows that h 1 0 and so the latter equations are equivalent to t 00 h 0 h 0 with a non zero h 0 2 proofs 52 ii the equation t h h is equivalent to t 00 h 0 h 0 and t 01 h 0 t 11 h 1 h 1 if p t 11 then these equations hold with h 0 0 and with a non zero h 1 if 6 p t 11 then the previous two equations hold precisely when t 00 h 0 h 0 is fulfilled with a non zero h 0 and t 01 h 0 t 11 i h 1 now we turn to the sufficiency result of this chapter but before we prove theorem 5 2 we need some auxiliary results given two operators a b f and b b g let us consider the transformation ta b b b g f defined by ta b y 7 ay y b the following lemma is crucial in our proof lemma 5 7 if f k er a i p a p b or g k er b i p b p a then the mapping ta b is injective proof let us assume that the second condition holds and ta b y 0 is true for some y b g f then for every p b p a j n and g ker b i j we have a i jy g y b i jg 0 whence y g 0 follows since a i is injective our assumption yields now that y 0 the other case can be treated similarly turning to the adjoints now we give a technical sufficient condition for the injectivity of the commutant map ping proposition 5 8 let us assume that the contraction t b h satisfies the condi tions i h 0 k er t 00 i p t 00 p t 11 ii t 01 ker t 00 i 0 t 11 i h 1 for all p t 00 then the commutant mapping of t is injective proof assuming that is not injective by lemma 5 5 we can find transformations c 00 t 00 and c 01 b h 1 h 0 satisfying the equation t 00 c 01 c 01 t 11 c 00 t 01 5 2 2 proofs 53 such that c 00 6 0 or c 01 6 0 our condition i implies by lemma 5 7 that c 00 6 0 another application of i yields that we can give p t 00 p t 11 and r n so that c 00 ker t 00 i r 6 0 and c 00 ker t 00 i r 1 0 assuming r 1 there exists v ker t 00 i such that c 00 v 6 0 the equations t 00 i c 00 v c 00 t 00 i v 0 imply that c 00 v ker t 00 i applying 5 2 we obtain t 11 i c 01 v c 01 t 00 i v t 11 i c 01 v t 01 c 00 v 5 3 which contradicts the condition ii let us assume now that r 1 for every v ker t 00 i we have 5 3 with t 01 c 00 v 0 since t 11 i is injective we get c 01 ker t 00 i 0 suppose that c 01 ker t 00 i s 1 0 holds for an integer 1 s r taking any v ker t 00 i s we obtain 5 3 with t 01 c 00 v 0 whence c 01 ker t 00 i s 0 follows by induction we arrive at the relation c 01 ker t 00 i r 1 0 setting any v ker t 00 i r such that c 00 v 6 0 we deduce 5 3 where 0 6 c 00 v ker t 00 i contradicting to ii we proceed with proving theorem 5 2 proof of theorem 5 2 the necessity of the condition was stated in theorem 5 1 let us assume now that p t p t d by proposition 5 6 we have p t 00 p t 11 and that t 01 ker t 00 i 0 t 11 i h 1 holds for every p t 00 since p t 00 p t 00 we conclude that the conditions of proposition 5 8 are satisfied and so is injective we continue with the verification of corollary 5 3 proof of corollary 5 3 we have to verify the conditions of theorem 5 2 since p t 00 d z d z 0 and the minimal function of t 00 is z z we obtain that p t 00 p t 00 see 48 proposition iii 4 7 and theorem iii 5 1 2 proofs 54 the completeness of the root subspace system of t 00 readily follows from 48 theorem iii 6 3 in what follows we provide an example for a non c 1 contraction which has injective commutant mapping this answers a question mentioned before in order to present the desired example we need the following technical lemma lemma 5 9 let ki i 1 2 3 4 be non zero hilbert spaces and a b k 1 k 2 b b k 1 k 3 y b k 2 k 4 z b k 3 k 4 fixing a and b the equation y a zb has only the trivial solution y 0 z 0 if and only if a and b have dense ranges and rana ranb 0 proof if a does not have dense range then taking non zero vectors v kera and k 4 k 4 the transformations y k 4 v and z 0 provide a non trivial solution of the equation y a zb the case when b does not have dense range can be discussed similarly if a k 2 b k 3 u 6 0 holds with some ki ki i 2 3 then setting a non zero k 4 k 4 the transformations y k 4 k 2 and z k 4 k 3 provide a non trivial solution assuming that a b are injective and rana ranb 0 let us consider the adjoint equation a y b z if y 6 0 then y k 4 6 0 for some k 4 k 4 and so the non zero vector u a y k 4 b z k 4 belongs to rana ranb hence y 0 and a similar reasoning shows that z 0 next we present our example example 5 10 let h 0 be a 1 dimensional hilbert space and t 00 i b h 0 with some d 0 let us fix a unit vector e h 0 let h 1 be an 0 dimensional hilbert space and let t 11 b h 1 be a c 1 contraction satisfying the conditions 1 6 p t 11 t 11 6 p t 11 and ran t 11 i 6 h 1 we construct a contraction t on the hilbert space h h 0 h 1 such that its matrix in this decomposition is of the form t i t 01 0 t 11 b h 0 h 0 5 4 it remains to identify t 01 2 proofs 55 since the operator i t 11 i t 11 t 11 t 11 i t 11 is invertible we can find a unit vector u h 1 such that u t 11 t 11 u does not belong to the range of t 11 i we recall that the defect operator of a contraction t is dt i t t clearly dt 00 dt 00 1 2 1 2 i now we define t 01 dt 00 e dt 11 u dt 11 by 13 lemma iv 2 1 the operator t is a contraction whose stable subspace obviously coincides with the non zero space h 0 let us assume that t 00 c 01 c 01 t 11 c 00 t 01 holds for some transformations c 01 b h 1 h 0 and c 00 t 00 b h 0 it follows that c 01 i t 11 c 00 t 01 applying lemma 5 9 with a i t 11 and b t 01 we infer that c 01 0 and c 00 0 thus the commutant mapping of t is injective by lemma 5 5 we note that a contraction t 11 with the requested properties can be obtained as a bilateral weighted shift operator with weight sequence wi i satisfying the conditions wi for i 0 wi 0 1 for i 0 and i 1 wi 0 next we prove theorem 5 4 proof of theorem 5 4 i let y i t t and z i t t be quasiaffinities it can be easily seen that yh 0 t h 0 t and zh 0 t h 0 t hold if t is not injective then there exists a non zero c t such that ch h 0 t but c y cz t is also non zero and c h y czh y ch yh 0 t h 0 t is satisfied thus t is not injective ii we know that is injective exactly when c t c h h 0 t h 0 t h 0 t imply c 0 taking the matrix of c in the decomposition h h h the statements of the theorem can be easily verified iii it is clear that t is in stable relation with itself if and only if t is injective after that we give example for the case when t t are injective but is not injective example 5 11 let us assume that h h h 0 h 0 where dimh 0 1 and dimh 0 0 let be complex numbers such that 0 1 the operators t 00 t 00 b h 0 are defined by t 00 i and t 00 i choosing an orthonormal basis en n in h 0 let us define the operators t 11 t 11 b h 0 by the equations t 11 en en 1 if n 0 1 n 2 en 1 if n 0 t 11 en en 1 if n 0 1 n 2 en 1 if n 0 2 proofs 56 it is easy to check that 1 is not an eigenvalue of t 11 t 11 and t 11 t 11 and that the operators t 11 i and t 11 i are injective but not surjective as in example 9 we can define the transformations t 01 t 01 b h 0 h 0 so that the operators t t 00 t 01 0 t 11 and t t 00 t 01 0 t 11 are contractions on h their stable subspaces coincide with h 0 and the corresponding commutant mappings t and t are injective the operator c c 00 c 01 0 0 intertwines t with t precisely when c 00 t 00 t 00 c 00 and c 00 t 01 c 01 t 11 t 00 c 01 the first equation holds only with c 00 0 and then the second equation takes the form c 01 t 11 i 0 applying the condition d it is easy to verify that p t 11 since the range of t 11 i is not dense in h 0 we can find a non zero transformation c 01 satisfying c 01 t 11 i 0 thus the contraction t is not in stable relation with t and so the commutant mapping of the orthogonal sum t t t is not injective our final aim in this chapter is to provide such a concrete contraction t b h which satisfies i iv of theorem 5 1 but still t is not injective before that we give a reformulation of condition iv of theorem 5 1 we say that an operator a b f is strongly irreducible if the only decomposition f f 1 uf 2 where f 1 and f 2 are invariant subspaces of a is the trivial decomposition proposition 5 12 let us assume that the stable component t 00 of the contraction t b h is strongly irreducible then condition iv of theorem 5 1 is equivalent to t 01 6 ran tt 00 t 11 proof if iv fails then the invariant subspacesm 0 m 1 of t exist such that 0 6 m 0 h 0 and m 0 um 1 h let n 0 denote the stable subspace of the restriction t m 1 since m 0 u n 0 h 0 and t 00 is strongly irreducible it follows that m 0 h 0 let p b h be the projection onto h 0 parallel to m 1 and let us consider its matrix p i p 01 0 0 in the decomposition h h 0 h 0 since p commutes with t we infer that t 01 p 01 t 11 t 00 p 01 whence t 01 t 00 p 01 p 01 t 11 ran tt 00 t 11 follows 2 proofs 57 conversely assuming t 01 ran tt 00 t 11 there exists a transformation p 01 b h 0 h 0 such that t 00 p 01 p 01 t 11 t 01 is valid then the operator p i p 01 0 0 is a projection commuting with t hence condition iv fails with the subspaces m 0 h 0 and m 1 kerp we finish this chapter with providing the desired example as follows theorem 5 13 there exists a contraction t b h such that the conditions i iv of theorem 5 1 hold but the commutant mapping of t is not injective proof let h 0 and h 1 be 0 dimensional hilbert spaces and let us form the orthog onal sum h h 0 h 1 let us fix an orthonormal basis ej j n in h 0 and let fj i j n i z be an orthonormal basis in h 1 the operator t 00 b h 0 is defined by t 00 ej j 2 1 ej 1 for j n it is easy to see that t 00 is a strongly irreducible c 00 contraction furthermore dt 00 e 1 e 1 and dt 00 ej 1 j 1 2 1 2 ej for j 1 the operator t 11 b h 1 is defined by t 11 fj i j 2 1 fj 1 if i 0 j n fj i 1 if i z 0 j n it is clear that t 11 is a c 11 contraction where dt 11 fj i 1 j 2 2 1 2 fj 0 if i 0 j n 0 if i z 0 j n the partial isometry v b h 1 h 0 is defined by v fj i ej if i 0 j n 0 if i z 0 j n setting t 01 1 2 v b h 1 h 0 let us consider the operator t t 00 t 01 0 t 11 b h applying 13 lemma iv 2 1 it is easy to verify that t is a contraction whose stable subspace obviously coincides with h 0 2 proofs 58 since t 00 is of class c 00 and t 11 is of class c 11 we infer that i t 00 t 11 0 whence i t 11 t 00 0 follows hence condition i of theorem 5 1 holds since p t 00 it follows by proposition 5 6 that p t d thus condition iii is also fulfilled following the method of 12 we show that v is not in the range of the transformation tt 00 t 11 for any z b h 1 h 0 and j n we have t 00 z zt 11 v t 00 z zt 11 v fj 0 t 00 zfj 0 ej z t 11 fj 0 furthermore for any j n we have t 00 zfj 0 ej 2 t 00 zfj 0 2 2 re zfj 0 t 00 ej 1 1 2 z t 00 ej since limj t 11 fj 0 0 and limj t 00 ej 0 we obtain that t 00 z zt 11 v 1 and so v 6 ran tt 00 t 11 since tt 00 t 11 is not surjective we infer by 9 that the condition ii must hold applying the previous proposition we also conclude that condition iv is valid therefore all conditions of theorem 5 1 hold it remains to show that the commutant mapping is not injective by lemma 5 5 it is enough to verify that t 00 t 01 ran tt 00 t 11 then an appropriate c 01 can be found for c 00 t 00 6 0 let h 1 denote the linear span of the basis vectors fj i in h 1 let us consider the linear transformation y 0 h 1 h 0 defined by y 0 fj i 0 if i 0 ej 1 if i 1 j i 1 k j 3 k 1 ej i if i 2 to show that y 0 is bounded we note first that e 1 is orthogonal to y 0 h 1 and y 10 ce 2 cf 1 1 for any j 3 the inverse image y 10 cej is the linear span of the vectors fj 1 1 fj 2 2 f 1 j 1 for any choice of complex numbers i j 1 i 1 we have y 0 j 1 i 1 ifj i i j 1 i 1 i y 0 fj i i j 1 i 1 i 2 1 2 j 1 i 1 y 0 fj i i 2 1 2 where j 1 i 1 y 0 fj i i 2 1 j 1 i 2 j 1 k j i 3 k 2 1 j 2 j 1 2 2 2 proofs 59 since these inverse images linearly generate h 1 we obtain that y 0 is indeed bounded thus y 0 can be uniquely extended to a transformation y b h 1 h 0 simple computations show that t 00 y fj i y t 11 fj i t 00 v fj i holds for every j n and i z we conclude that t 00 y y t 11 t 00 v hence t 00 t 01 12 t 00 v ran tt 00 t 11 what we wanted to prove the complete characterization of injectivity of the commutant mapping remains open chapter 6 cyclic properties of weighted shifts on directed trees 1 statements of the results the classes of the so called weighted bilateral unilateral or backward shift operators 37 44 are very useful for an operator theorist besides normal operators these are the next natural classes on which conjectures could be tested recently z j jab lonski i b jung and j stochel defined a natural generalization of these classes in 22 they were interested among others in hyponormality co hyponormality subnormality etc and they provided many examples for several unanswered questions in this chapter we will study cyclic properties of bounded mainly contractive weighted shift operators on directed trees namely first we will explore their asymptotic behaviour and as an application we will obtain some results concerning cyclicity these are the results of 18 we recall some definitions from 22 the pair t v e is a directed graph if v is an arbitrary usually infinite set and e v v v v v v we call an element of v and e a vertex and a directed edge of t respectively we say that t is connected if for any two distinct vertices u v v there exists an undirected path between them i e there are finitely many vertices u v 0 v 1 vn v v n n such that vj 1 vj or vj vj 1 e for every 1 j n the finite sequence of distinct vertices v 0 v 1 vn v n n is called a directed circuit if vj 1 vj e for all 1 j n and vn v 0 e the directed graph t v e is a directed tree if the following three conditions are satisfied i t is connected ii for each v v there exists at most one u v such that u v e and iii t has no circuit from now on t always denotes a directed tree in the directed tree a vertex v is called a child of u v if u v e the set of all children of u is denoted by chit u chi u 60 1 statements of the results 61 conversely if for a given vertex v we can find a unique vertex u such that u v e then we shall say that u is the parent of v we denote u by part v par v we will also use the notation park v par par k times v if it makes sense and par 0 will be the identity map if a vertex has no parent then we call it a root of t a directed tree is either rootless or has a unique root see 22 proposition 2 1 1 we will denote this unique root by roott root if it exists a subgraph of a directed tree which is itself a directed tree is called a subtree we will use the notation v v root if a vertex has no children then we call it a leaf and t is leafless if it has no leaves the set of all leaves of t will be denoted by lea t given a subset w v of vertices we put chi w v wchi v chi 0 w w chin 1 w chi chin w for all n n and dest w des w n 0 chi n w where des w is called the descendants of the subset w and if w u then we simply write des u if n n 0 then the set genn t u genn u n j 0 chi j parj u is called the nth generation of u i e we can go up at most n levels and then down the same amount of levels and gent u gen u n 0 genn u is the whole generation or the level of u from the equation see 22 proposition 2 1 6 v n 0 des parn u 6 1 one can easily see that the different levels can be indexed by the integer numbers or with a subset of the integers in such a way that if a vertex v is in the kth level then the children of v are in the k 1 th level and par v is in the k 1 th level whenever par v makes sense the complex hilbert space 2 v is the usual space of all square summable complex functions on v with the standard innerproduct f g u v f u g u f g 2 v for u v we define eu v u v 2 v where u v is the kronecker delta function obviously the set eu u v is an orthonormal basis we will refer to 2 w as the subspace ew w w for any subset w v 1 statements of the results 62 let v v v c be a set of weights satisfying sup v chi u v 2 u v then the weighted shift operator on the directed tree t is the operator defined by s 2 v 2 v eu 7 v chi u vev by 22 proposition 3 1 8 this defines a bounded linear operator with precise norm s sup v chi u v 2 u v we will consider only bounded weighted shift operators on directed trees especially contractions i e s 1 in certain parts of the chapter we recall that every s is unitarily equivalent to s where v v v 0 moreover the unitary operator u with s us u can be chosen such that eu is an eigenvector of u for every u v it is also proposed that if a weight v is zero then the weighted shift operator on this directed tree is a direct sum of two other weighted shift operators on directed trees see 22 theorem 3 2 1 and proposition 3 1 6 in view of these facts this chapter will exclusively consider weighted shift operators on directed trees with positive weights the boundedness and the condition about weights together imply that every vertex has countably many children thus by 6 1 2 v is separable an operator t b h is cyclic if there is a vector such that ht h hh t nh n n 0 p t h p pc h where pc denotes the set of all complex polynomials such an h h vector is called a cyclic vector for t the first theorem concerns a countable orthogonal sum of weighted backward shift operators theorem 6 1 suppose that ej k j j k n 0 is an orthonormal basis in the hilbert space h where j 6 is a countable set and wj k j j k n 0 c is a bounded set of weights consider the following operator bej k 0 if k 0 wj k 1 ej k 1 otherwise i if there is no zero weight then b is cyclic 1 statements of the results 63 figure 1 when there is at least one leaf ii assume there is no zero weight and there exists a vector g n 1 ran bn such that for every fixed j j g ej k 6 0 is fulfilled for infinitely many k n 0 then we can find a cyclic vector from the linear manifold n 1 ran bn iii the operator b is cyclic if and only if b has at most one zero weights the proof of theorem 6 1 was motivated by the solution of 20 problem 160 we would like to note that the case in iii of theorem 6 1 when j 1 was done by z g hua in 21 however this article was written in chinese therefore the author of the dissertation was not able to read the proof the above theorem can be considered as a generalization of hua s result now we give our results concerning cyclicity of weighted shift operators on directed trees the following quantity br t u v lea t chi u 1 is called the branching index of t by ii of 22 proposition 3 5 1 we have dim ran s 1 br t if t has a root br t if t has no root 6 2 it is easy to see that for every cyclic operator t b h we have dim ran t 1 therefore the only interesting case concerning the cyclicity of s is when t has no root and br t 1 if the branching index is zero we obtain a usual shift operator if lea t 2 then t will be represented by the graph v e with vertices v j z j j 0 k 1 k k 0 where we assume 1 k 0 j 0 and edges 1 statements of the results 64 figure 2 t e j 1 j j j 0 0 1 j 1 j 1 j k 0 the corresponding weights will be v v v if lea t 1 then it will be represented by a very similar graph see figure 1 if there is no leaf then usually the associated representative graph will be denoted by another symbol t figure 2 we remind the reader that every weight is positive theorem 6 2 suppose that the directed tree t v e has no root and br t 1 i if lea t 2 then every bounded weighted shift on t is cyclic ii suppose t v e has a unique leaf a weighted shift s on t is cyclic if and only if the bilateral shift operator w on the subtree t z e z z with weights n n v v z is cyclic in particular if s c 0 2 v is contractive then s is cyclic iii assume that s is contractive and of class c 1 then it has no cyclic vectors iv there exists a cyclic weighted shift operator s on t as far as we know complete characterization of cyclicity of bilateral weighted shift op erators is open our last result concerns cyclicity of the adjoint of weighted shift operators on directed trees theorem 6 3 i if t has a root and the contractive weighted shift operator s on t is of class c 1 then s is cyclic ii if t is rootless br t and the weighted shift contraction s on t is of class c 1 then s is cyclic in order to prove the above theorem we will verify that s s k k n is cyclic where s denotes a simple bilateral shift operator and s k denotes the orthogonal sum of k pieces of simple unilateral shift operators 2 proofs 65 2 proofs first we would like to show how the asymptotic behaviour of a hilbert space contraction can be applied in order to obtain cyclicity results if t is cyclic and has dense range then h is cyclic if and only if th is cyclic this and a consequence are stated in the next lemma for hilbert spaces but we note that in banach spaces the proof would be the same this proves in that case that the set of cyclic vectors span the whole space in fact this is always true see 19 for an elementary proof lemma 6 4 i if a dense range operator t has a cyclic vector f then tf is also a cyclic vector ii if t is a cyclic operator which has dense range and n b cn is a cyclic nilpotent operator n n i e a 0 jordan block then t n is also cyclic proof i the set p t f p pc is dense since ran t is also dense a dense subset has dense image under t so tp t f p t tf p pc is also dense ii let us take a cyclic vector f h for t and a cyclic vector e cn for n we will show that f e is cyclic for the orthogonal sum t n of course t kf nke t kf 0 k n h thus 0 n je t kf nke k n 0 for every 0 j n and hence f e is a cyclic vector the vector h h is hypercyclic for t if t nh n n 0 h then the operator t is said to be hypercyclic the previous and the next lemma will be used many times throughout this chapter lemma 6 5 i if t q y b h y has dense range y t qy holds and f is cyclic or hypercyclic resp for t then y f is cyclic or hypercyclic resp for q ii if t c 1 h is a contraction and the isometric asymptote vt has no cyclic vectors then neither has t iii if t c 1 h is a contraction and v t has a cyclic vector g then a 1 2 t g is cyclic for t 2 proofs 66 iv if t c 1 h is a contraction and u t has a cyclic vector g then a 1 2 t g is cyclic for t proof i of course y p t p q y holds for all p pc let us assume that f is cyclic for t i e p t f p pc is dense in h then y p t f p q y f p pc is also dense since y has dense range which means that y f is cyclic for q the hypercyclic case is very similar the other three points are special cases of i there is a consequence of the previous lemma corollary 6 6 suppose that the operator t is hypercyclic then t t c 1 h proof obviously t 6 0 assume that t t c 1 h and let us fix a hypercyclic vector f h for t since a 1 2 t kf t kv kt a 1 2 f t kv kt a 1 2 f k 0 should be dense in h but t kv kt a 1 2 f t k a 1 2 f is bounded or bounded from below which is a contradiction it is easy to see that for the adjoint of a contractive weighted bilateral shift operator s wek wkek 1 0 wk 1 the asymptotic limit is defined by a ek j k wj 2 ek this means that s w is stable or sw c 1 2 v if sw c 1 2 z then the isometric asymptote vs w b 2 z of s w is the simple bilateral backward shift operator vs wek ek 1 since v s w is cyclic this means that all contractive c 1 bilateral shift operators are cyclic we point out that non cyclic bilateral shift operators exist the first example was given by b beauzamy in 2 in 44 proposition 42 sufficient conditions can be found for cyclic ity and non cyclicity but there is no characterization for cyclic bilateral shift operators which is quite surprising since for other cyclic type properties such characterizations exist see e g 42 and 43 therefore it is a challenging problem to give this characterization for cyclicity we proceed with the proof of theorem 6 1 2 proofs 67 proof of theorem 6 1 throughout the proof we may always assume without loss of generality that b 1 holds this happens if and only if the weights are from d i take a vector of the following form f l 1 jl kl ejl kl h such that jl kl 0 for every l n 0 kl 1 kl and for any j j infinitely many l n exist which satisfy jl j our aim is to modify f by decreasing its coordinates in a way that they remain positive and after the procedure we obtain a modification of f f 6 0 which is a cyclic vector of b we have 1 jm kmwjm km 1 wjm km k bkf ejm km k l m jl klwjl kl 1 wjl kl k jm kmwjm km 1 wjm km k ejl kl k 6 3 for every m n km 1 k km where we set k 0 1 let us consider the quantity m max l m 1 jm kmwjm km 1 wjm km kbkf ejm km k 2 km 1 k km max l m jl klwjl kl 1 wjl kl k jm kmwjm km 1 wjm km k 2 km 1 k km 6 4 which is clearly finite let us suppose for a moment that m 1 2 m is satisfied for all m n in this case ej k hb f would hold for every j j k n 0 and thus f would be a cyclic vector for b therefore our aim during the modification process is that 6 4 will hold for the modified vector if 1 1 2 then let us change every jl kl to jl kl 2 1 for every l 1 otherwise we do not do anything then with these modified coordinates 1 1 2 if 2 1 4 then we change every jl kl to jl kl 4 2 for every l 2 otherwise we do not modify anything then 1 becomes less or equal to than before and 2 1 4 suppose that we have already achieved j 1 2 j for every 1 j m 1 in case when m 1 2 m we modify jl kl to jl kl 2 m m for every l m otherwise we do not change anything then j becomes less or equal to than before for every 1 j m 1 and m 1 2 m and so on we notice that 2 proofs 68 every coordinate was modified only finitely many times therefore this procedure gives us a new vector f with positive coordinates satisfying 6 4 therefore f is cyclic for b ii for a vector x l 1 xjl kl ejl kl h x ran b n holds if and only if l 1 xjl kl 2 wjl kl wjl kl n 1 2 thus if x ran bn and y l 1 yjl kl ejl kl h with yjl kl xjl kl l n then y ran b n is also fulfilled assume that in the be ginning we could choose a vector g n 1 ran bn such that for every fixed j j g ej k 6 0 is fulfilled for infinitely many k n 0 then g j j k 0 g ej k ej k is also in n 1 ran bn and by changing some coordinates to zero we can find a vector f which has the form as in the beginning of the proof of point i therefore applying the process above we can find a cyclic vector for b which is in n 1 ran bn iii for the sufficiency we may consider the operator b n where b b h is a backward shift operator with strictly positive weights and n is a cyclic nilpotent operator acting on cn for some n n i e a jordan block with zero diagonals because this is unitarily equivalent to the operator mentioned in the statement of the theorem since b has a dense range and it is cyclic ii of lemma 6 4 gives us what we wanted the necessity is clear since the co dimension of ran b is at most one whenever b is cyclic we proceed with the verification of several results concerning the asymptotic behaviour of a weighted shift operator on a directed tree they will be crucial in the proof of theorem 6 2 and 6 3 the first step is to calculate the powers of s and their adjoints which was done in 4 lemma 2 3 1 namely for a weighted shift operator s on the directed tree t and for any n n u v the following holds sn eu v chin u n 1 j 0 parj v ev s n eu n 1 j 0 parj u eparn v if par n u makes sense 0 otherwise in this chapter the asymptotic limit of s and s will be denoted by a and a respectively and u u will stand for the isometric asymptote of them we calculate the asymptotic limit a of s as follows 2 proofs 69 proposition 6 7 let s be a weighted shift operator on t which is a contraction then every eu is an eigenvector for a aeu ueu u v with the corresponding eigenvalues u limn v chin u n 1 j 0 2 parj v proof for any n n and u v since the asymptotic limit exists s n s n eu v chin u n 1 j 0 parj v s n ev v chin u n 1 j 0 2 parj v eu ueu which implies aeu ueu the stable subspace of s will be denoted by h 0 we proceed with obtaining some properties of h 0 2 v h 0 since a is a diagonal operator there exists a set v v with the following properties h 0 2 v v and h 0 2 v proposition 6 8 the following implications are valid for every contractive weighted shift operator s on t and for every vertex u v i if eu h 0 then 2 des u h 0 i e u v des u v v ii eu h 0 if and only if 2 chi u h 0 i e u v chi u v v this is fulfilled in the special case when u is a leaf iii if eu h 0 then epark u h 0 for every k n 0 i e u v park u v k n 0 iv the subgraph t v e e v v is a leafless subtree v if t has no root neither has t and vi if t has a root then either s c 0 2 v or roott roott proof the facts that h 0 is invariant for s and that the weights are strictly positive imply i the sufficiency in ii is a part of i on the other hand suppose that 2 chi u h 0 then u lim n w chin u n 1 j 0 2 parj w lim n v chi u 2 v w chin 1 v n 2 j 0 2 parj w v chi u 2 v v 0 2 proofs 70 since v chi u 2 v w chin 1 v n 2 j 0 2 parj w v chi u 2 v 1 for all n n and w chin 1 v n 2 j 0 2 parj w v this proves the necessity in ii point iii follows from ii immediately we have to check three conditions for t to be a subtree two of them is obvious since they were also true in t in order to see the connectedness of t two distinct u v v are taken since v j 0 dest par j t u parkt u parlt v holds with some k l n 0 then iii gives parit u par j t v v for every i k and j l which provides an undirected path in t connecting u and v finally via ii it is trivial that t is leafless and the last two points immediately follow from iii in view of v vi we have part u part u for any u v so we will simply write par u in this case as well let us take an arbitrary leafless subtree t v e of t with the properties that if t is rootless then t is also rootless and if t has a root then t has the same root it is trivial that 2 v v is invariant for s in the special case when it is the stable subspace it is also hyperinvariant but is it hyperinvariant for all weighted shift operators that are defined on t the answer is negative as we will see from the next example example 6 9 let us consider t and set all of the weights to be equal to 1 then s is a bounded weighted shift operator on t the unitary operator defined by the following equations ue 0 e 0 and uek ek uek ek ue k e k for every k n obviously commutes with s but it is easy to see that 2 n is not invariant for u hence it is not hyperinvariant for s now we identify the asymptotic limit a of the adjoint s the stable subspace of s will be denoted by h 0 since the weights are in the interval 0 1 any infinite product is unconditionally convergent proposition 6 10 if s is a contractive weighted shift operator on the directed tree t then the following two points are satisfied i if t has a root then s c 0 2 v 2 proofs 71 ii if t is rootless then h 0 hu u v where hu v gen u j 0 parj v ev 2 v the equality hu hv holds if v gen u and every hu is an eigenvector a hu auhu u v with the corresponding eigenvalue au hu 2 v gen u j 0 2 parj v so every level has one such hu moreover if hu is not zero for a vertex u then it is not zero for every u v proof the first statement is clear so we only deal with ii we have v genn u j 0 2 parj v v genn u n 1 j 0 2 parj v s eparn u 2 1 for all n n indeed 0 v gen u j 0 2 parj v 1 which means that hu is actually a vector of 2 v for n n we have sn s n eu n 1 j 0 parj u sn eparn u n 1 j 0 parj u v genn u n 1 j 0 parj v ev since limn s n s n eu a eu a eu ev j 0 parj u j 0 parj v if v gen u 0 otherwise which yields a eu j 0 parj u v gen u j 0 parj v ev j 0 parj u hu now we get a hu v gen u j 0 parj v a ev v gen u j 0 2 parj v hu since gen u gen v and thus hu hv 2 proofs 72 to conclude the relation h 0 hu u v fix a vector h 2 gen u h hu using the notation v h ev v gen u the equation a h v gen u va ev v gen u v j 0 parj v hu 0 follows by the orthogonality of h and hu therefore the equation h 0 hu u v is trivial since hu 0 if and only if au 0 finally let us suppose that hu 0 holds for a vertex u v then 2 gen u h 0 and since h 0 is invariant for s 2 gen park u h 0 for every k n if we set a w chi u then aw w gen w j 0 2 parj w v gen u w chi v j 0 2 parj w v gen u j 0 2 parj v w chi v 2 w v gen u j 0 hu ev 2 w chi v 2 w 0 so 2 chi gen u h 0 by induction we get h 0 2 v the next step is to compute the isometric asymptote we call the vertex u a branching vertex if chi u 1 and the set of all branching vertices is denoted by v in proposition 6 8 we used the notation t v e for the subtree such that 2 v h 0 we will write s b 2 z and s b 2 n 0 for the simple bilateral and unilateral shift operators i e sen en 1 n z and s ek ek 1 k n 0 from the von neumann wold decomposition it is clear that the c n u isometries are exactly the orthogonal sums of some simple unilateral shift operators proposition 6 11 for such a weighted shift operator s on t that is a contraction and s c 0 2 v the isometric asymptote u b 2 v is a weighted shift operator on the subtree t v e u s with precise weights v v v par v v v this isometry is unitarily equivalent to one of the followings i br t 1 j 1 s if t has a root ii br t j 1 s if t has no root and u is a c n u isometry i e v gent u j 0 2 parj v 0 for some and then for every u v iii s br t j 1 s if t has no root and u is not a c n u isometry 2 proofs 73 proof because of the condition s c 0 2 v v 6 for any u v we have ueu 1 u ua 1 2 eu 1 u a 1 2 s eu 1 u v chit u v a 1 2 ev v chit u v v u ev this establishes that u is a weighted shift operator on t with weights v v v par v v v first suppose that t has a root then t has the same root as t but contractive weighted shift operators on a directed tree which has a root are of class c 0 so in this case u is a unilateral shift operator since the co rank of u is br t 1 we infer that u and br t 1 j 1 s are unitarily equivalent second assume that t has no root and u is a c n u isometry the isometry u is c n u if and only if u c 0 2 v which happens if and only if v gent u j 0 2 parj v 0 for some and then for every u v by proposition 6 10 again the co rank of u is br t and therefore u is unitarily equivalent to br t j 1 s finally let us suppose that t has no root and v gent u j 0 2 parj v 0 for every u v then the unitary part of u acts on h 0 u 0 6 ku v gent u j 0 parj v ev u v set u v then uku v gent u j 0 parj v uev v gent u w chit v j 0 parj v w ew w gent w j 0 parj w ew kw for some w chit u therefore we get that u h 0 u is a simple bilateral shift operator since the co rank of u is br t the operator u is unitarily equivalent to s br t j 1 s remark 6 12 i if the directed tree t has a root then any isometric weighted shift operator on t is of class c 0 i e an orthogonal sum of br t pieces of unilateral shift operators 2 proofs 74 ii in general if we have an isometric weighted shift operator u on a directed tree then the set up of the tree does not tell us whether u is a c n u isometry or not to see this take a rootless binary tree i e chi u 2 u v if we set the weights v 1 2 v v then s is clearly an isometry with v gent u j 0 2 parj v v gent u j 0 1 2 0 for every u v therefore u is a unilateral shift operator on the other hand if we fix a two sided sequence of vertices ul l v such that par ul ul 1 for every l z and consider the weights v 1 2 if v v l chi ul exp 1 l 1 2 if v ul for some l z 1 2 ul if v chi ul 1 ul for some l z we clearly get an isometric weighted shift operator on that directed tree which has non trivial unitary part in fact v gent ul j 0 2 parj v j 0 2 ul j exp 2 j 0 1 l j 1 2 0 l z iii suppose that the rootless directed tree t has a vertex u v which has the following property v des u k 1 park u if we take an isometric weighted shift operator on t with weights v v v then s is not a c n u isometry indeed park u 1 for every k n 0 and thus v gen park u j 0 2 parj k v 1 0 the above points show that two unitarily equivalent weighted shift operators on di rected trees can be defined on a very different directed tree now we turn to the calculation of the isometric asymptote u b h 0 of the adjoint s proposition 6 13 suppose that the contractive weighted shift operator s on t does not belong to the class c 0 then t has no root and we have u hu au apar u hpar u u v 2 proofs 75 where hu 6 0 for every u v as a matter of fact u is a simple unilateral shift operator if there is a last level i e chi gen u for some u v and it is a bilateral shift operator elsewhere proof if s c 0 2 v then hu 6 0 and au 6 0 for every u v for a u v u 1 au hu 1 au u a 1 2 hu 1 au a 1 2 s hu 1 au v gen u j 0 parj v a 1 2 s ev 1 au v gen u j 0 parj

bilateral shift operator as a consequence we obtain a characterization for contractive weighted shifts on di rected trees that are similar to isometries or co isometries the related result reads as follows corollary 6 14 consider the contraction s which is a weighted shift operator on a directed tree then the following statements hold i s is similar to an isometry if and only if inf u u v 0 ii s is similar to a co isometry if and only if it is a bilateral weighted shift operator with j j 0 or it is a weighted backward shift operator with 0 j j 0 then it is similar to the simple bilateral or the simple backward shift operator respectively proof i this is a simple consequence of 31 proposition 3 8 proposition 6 7 and 6 11 ii the similarity to a co isometry implies the similarity of s to an isometry then by proposition 6 10 we have that t has no root and chi u 1 for every u v first suppose that t has no leaves then clearly s is a weighted bilateral shift operator by 31 proposition 3 8 we have j j 0 and therefore s is similar to s 2 proofs 76 second assume that t has a leaf then it has a unique leaf and trivially s is a weighted unilateral shift operator again by 31 proposition 3 8 we have j 0 j 0 and that s is similar to s we notice that a contractive weighted shift operator on a directed tree is similar to a unitary operator if and only if it is a bilateral shift operator of class c 11 and its asymptotic limit is invertible this is a simple consequence of the previous corollary in what follows we prove some preliminary results in order to verify i iii of theorem 6 2 first we provide the following similarity lemma lemma 6 15 consider a rootless directed tree t with the properties br t 1 and lea t 6 let s be a bounded weighted shift operator on t see figure 1 then s is similar to an orthogonal sum w n where i w is a weighted backward shift operator and n is a cyclic nilpotent operator acting on a finite dimensional space whenever lea t 2 ii w is a weighted bilateral shift operator and n is a cyclic nilpotent operator acting on a finite dimensional space if lea t 1 holds proof let us define the following two subspaces e 2 z v and e e 2 1 2 3 v clearly the second subspace is finite dimensional set the vectors gk k j 1 1 j ek k j 1 1 j ek for every 2 k k 0 now we define two operators on these subspaces as follows w e e en 7 n 1 en 1 if n is not a leaf 0 if n is a leaf which is a weighted bilateral shift operator and n e e ek 7 gk gk 1 e k 1 if k k 0 0 if k k 0 these are clearly bounded operators we state that the following operator x 2 v 2 v ek 7 1 gk gk 1 k k 0 en 7 en n z v is invertible and x w n s x is satisfied the boundedness of x is trivial since ek ek is invariant for all 1 k k 0 and en is an eigenvector for every n z v the 2 proofs 77 invertiblity is also obvious the following equations show that x w n s x holds as well which ends the proof x w n en x nen 1 nen 1 s en s xen n v z x w n e 1 0 s 1 g 1 g 1 s xe 1 x w n ek x gk 1 gk e k 1 1 gk gk 1 s 1 gk gk s xek 2 k k 0 let m be the normalized lebesgue measure on t and l 2 the lebesgue space l 2 l 2 t the simple bilateral shift operator s can be represented as the multiplication operator by the identity function on l 2 it is a known fact that g l 2 is cyclic for s if and only if g 6 0 a e t and t log g dm from lemma 6 4 it is obvious that g is cyclic if and only if sg g is cyclic but this can be obtained from the previous characterization as well the simple unilateral shift operator s can also be represented as a multiplication operator by but on the hardy space h 2 h 2 t before proving the first three points of theorem 6 2 we show that the orthogonal sum s s has no cyclic vectors the proof uses only elementary hardy space techniques proposition 6 16 the operator s s has no cyclic vectors proof suppose that f g l 2 h 2 is a cyclic vector and let us denote the orthogonal projection onto l 2 0 and onto 0 h 2 by p 1 and p 2 respectively then nf n n 0 p 1 nf ng n n 0 is dense in l 2 i e f is cyclic for s and similarly we get that g is cyclic for s as well this implies that f 6 0 is valid for a e t and g is an outer function we state that 0 g l 2 h 2 f g to see this consider an arbitrary complex polynomial p then pf pg 0 g 2 t pf 2 p 1 g 2 dm 2 proofs 78 one of the sets a p 1 z c re z 1 2 or ac p 1 z c re z 1 2 has lebesgue measure at least 1 2 if m a 1 2 then we obtain pf pg 0 g 2 a p 1 g 2 dm a g 2 4 dm 1 4 inf e g 2 dm e l m e 1 2 0 similarly if m b 1 2 then we calculate pf pg 0 g 2 1 4 inf e f 2 dm e l m e 1 2 0 thus s s is not cyclic now we are in a position to prove i iii of theorem 6 2 proof of the points i iii in theorem 6 2 i this is an easy consequence of lemma 6 15 and theorem 6 1 ii by ii of lemma 6 15 s is similar to w n if w has no cyclic vectors then obviously neither has s if w is cyclic then by lemma 6 4 we can obviously see that s has a cyclic vector since c 1 bilateral shifts are cyclic the other statement follows immediately iii by proposition 6 11 the isometric asymptote u of s is unitarily equivalent to the orthogonal sum s s which has no cyclic vectors this implies together with lemma 6 5 that neither has s we proceed with the examination of the case when a weighted shift operator on t is similar to an orthogonal sum of a bi and a unilateral shift operator then we will be able to verify the last point of theorem 6 2 let us define another bounded operator w 2 v by the following equations w en wn 1 en 1 w e k w k 1 e k 1 n z k 2 where the weights wn n z wk k n 1 are bounded obviously w is an orthogonal sum of a bi and a unilateral weighted shift operator our aim is to find out whether there exists a w such that it is similar to s in order to do this we will try to find a bounded invertible x b 2 which intertwines s with a w 2 proofs 79 figure 3 similarity of s on t to an orthogonal sum in some cases xs w x however we found it easier to examine the adjoint equation s x x w we shall use the following notations gk k j 1 1 j ek k j 1 1 j ek k n it is easy to see that s gk gk 1 if k 10 if k 1 and that for k 6 l the vectors gk and gl are orthogonal to each other we also define the following subspaces e ek k z e ek k n g gk k n in the next lemma for technical reasons we assume that s is contractive lemma 6 17 the following two conditions are equivalent for the contractive s i the positive sequence k j 1 j j k n is bounded ii 2 v e u g proof i ii it is obvious that e g 0 so we only have to prove the equation 2 v e g to do this take an arbitrary vector x 2 v and suppose that x e g for some vectors e e and g g with the following notations k x ek n x en k g gk n e en k n n z 2 proofs 80 we can write the following equations k g ek k gk gk ek k gk 1 k k e ek g ek k k gk 1 k k n and m m m n 0 from them we infer that k k gk 1 k k k 1 k 1 k k k n therefore there exists an e e and g g such that x e g holds if and only if k 1 k 2 gk 2 and k 1 2 k are fulfilled but the first inequality always holds since k 1 k 2 gk 2 k 1 k 2 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 x 2 the second one is equivalent to k 1 1 k 1 k 2 k 2 and in particular this holds if the sequence k j 1 j j k n is bounded ii i if the sequence is not bounded then there exists a vector x 2 v such that this sum is not finite in fact if km j 1 j j m m n hold with some increasing sequence km m 1 then let k m m 3 2 and with this choice we have k 1 1 k 1 k 2 2 k m 1 1 m now we are able to prove a similarity theorem we say that the operator t 1 b h is a quasiaffine transform of t 2 b k if there exists a quasiaffinity i e which is injective and has a dense range x i t 1 t 2 2 proofs 81 proposition 6 18 let s be a weighted shift contraction on the directed tree t and set wn n n z wk gk 1 gk k 1 the following two points hold i s is always a quasiaffine transform of w ii if k j 1 j j k n is bounded then the weighted shift s is similar to w proof since s is a contraction wk gk 1 gk 1 and thus w is bounded we define x as follows x ek 1 gk gk x en en k n n z the operator x is bounded and quasiaffine because ek ek is invariant for x for every k n and x ek ek 2 the next equations show that x intertwines w with s s x en s en nen 1 nx en 1 x w en n z s x ek 1 gk s gk 0 k 11 gk gk 1 k 1 x w ek k n this proves that s is a quasiaffine transform of w if eug 2 v then since x e b e g and x e b e e are unitary transfor mations therefore x is an invertible bounded operator this proves the similarity we provide the following special case of the above proposition corollary 6 19 if s c 0 2 v which is defined on t then it is similar to an orthogonal sum of a weighted bi and a weighted unilateral shift operator proof the condition s c 0 2 v is equivalent to the positivity of j 1 j or j 1 j by interchanging j and j for every j n if necessary we may assume that the first one is not zero then the sequence k j 1 j j k n is obviously bounded proposition 6 18 implies the similarity we continue with the verification of iv of theorem 6 2 2 proofs 82 proof of iv in theorem 6 2 let us consider an s such that it is similar to a w and the bilateral summand of w is hypercyclic by decreasing k s we may also assume that the unilateral summand is contractive take a hypercyclic vector f e for the bilateral summand we will show that f e 1 is cyclic for w and therefore s is cyclic first let us take an arbitrary vector e e then there is a subsequence such that 1 k w jkf e k therefore 1 k w jk f e 1 e k also holds since the unilateral summand is a contraction second fix an n n 0 our aim is to prove that w ne 1 w k f e 1 k n 0 since w kf k n is dense in e there is a subsequence w jkf k 1 with the property 1 k w jkf w nf k this implies that 1 k w jk f e 1 w nf k and hence w ne 1 w k f e 1 k n 0 therefore f e 1 is indeed a cyclic vector of w let us denote the operator s s k times by s k k n and the orthogonal sum of 0 piece of s by s 0 we close this chapter by proving theorem 6 3 in order to do that we will apply the following theorem theorem 6 20 the operator s s k is cyclic for every k n proof the method is the following we intertwine s s k and s with an injective operator x b l 2 h 2 l 2 sx x s s k then taking the adjoint of both sides in the equation we get s s k x x s since x has dense range and s is cyclic this implies the cyclicity of s s k for any k n by i of lemma 6 5 which is unitarily equivalent to s s k for the k 1 case the definition of the operator x is the following x l 2 h 2 l 2 f g 7 f g where l 6 0 for a e t and t log d an easy estimate shows that x b l 2 h 2 l 2 assume that 0 f g if f 0 g 0 resp then g 0 f 0 resp follows immediately on the other hand taking logarithms of the absolute values and integrating over t we get t log g dm t log f log dm t f dm t log dm 2 proofs 83 which is a contradiction therefore x is injective the equation sx x s s is trivial therefore s s is indeed cyclic now let us turn to the case when k 1 we will work with induction so let us suppose that we have already proven the cyclicity of s s k 1 for a k 2 consider the following operator y l 2 h 2 h 2 k times l 2 h 2 h 2 k 1 times f g 1 gk 7 f g 1 g 2 gk with the same l as in the definition of x obviously y is bounded linear and injective and we have y s s k s s k 1 y this proves that s s k is also cyclic of course now a question arises naturally is the operator s s 0 cyclic the previous thoughtline does not work for this case however if the answer were positive we could prove ii of theorem 6 3 without the condition br t now we are able to verify theorem 6 3 proof of theorem 6 3 obviously t is leafless in both cases the isometric asymp tote u of s is just taken since u is cyclic the operator s is also cyclic by lemma 6 5 proposition 6 11 and theorem 6 1 we would like to point out that if we take a weighted shift operator on a directed tree which is similar to a w and the adjoint of the bilateral summand has no cyclic vectors then obviously we get an s on t such that s has no cyclic vectors this shows that the adjoint of a weighted shift on a directed tree is usually not cyclic summary in this dissertation we presented results concerning asymptotic behaviour of hilbert space power bounded operators and some applications the dissertation consists of five papers 14 has appeared in periodica mathematica hungarica 15 has appeared in acta scientiarum mathematicarum szeged 16 has accepted in linear and multilinear algebra and 17 has been accepted in proceedings of the american mathematical society the last one 18 is still under revision the papers 15 16 17 18 were also uploaded to the arxiv first in chapter 2 we characterized all possible asymptotic limits of hilbert space contractions we proved that in a finite dimensional space the asymptotic limit of a con traction is always a projection in the case whenh is separable and infinite dimensional we proved that a positive and contractive operator a arises asymptotically from a contraction if and only if a arises asymptotically from a contraction in uniform convergence more over these conditions are equivalent to the following either re a 1 or a is a projection which holds if and only if dimh 0 1 dimh 1 is satisfied for every 0 1 where h denotes the spectral subspace of a associated with the borel subset r if dimh 0 then we provided a similar result we concluded chapter 2 by investigating what conditions on two contractions have to be satisfied in order that their asymptotic limits coincide we also examined the reverse question then we turned to the investigation of l asymptotic limits of power bounded matrices we showed that in this case at l is independent of the particular choice of the banach limit l moreover we have at l at c limn 1 n n j 1 t jt j we called at c the cesa ro asymptotic limit of t in order to characterize the possible cesa ro asymptotic limits we examined two separate cases the first one is when t is similar to a unitary operator which is in the matrix case equivalent to the condition that t is of class c 11 we proved that a positive definite matrix a is the cesa ro asymptotic limit of a power bounded matrix t if and only if the trace of a 1 equals the dimension of the space which is equivalent 84 summary 85 to the condition that there is an invertible matrix s with unit column vectors such that a s 1 s 1 ss 1 holds using the charaterization in the previous case we proved the description in the other case too i e when t is not similar to a unitary matrix namely for a given singular positive semi definite matrix a 6 0 we can find a power bounded matrix t such that a at c is valid if and only if tr a kera 1 dim kera which holds if and only if a s 1 i 0 s 1 is fulfilled with some invertible matrix s with unit column vectors and an orthogonal projection of the form 0 6 i 0 6 i chapter 4 was devoted to a possible generalization of sz nagy s similarity theorem and a strengthening of it we proved that similar power bounded operators t and s share the same asymptotic property namely the powers of the operator t and its adjoint t are bounded from below on the orthogonal complement of the corresponding stable subspaces if and only if the same holds for s in particular this property is satisfied by any power bounded normal operator and therefore by any power bounded t that is similar to a normal operator this can be considered as a generalization of sz nagy s theorem although only in the necessity part the sufficiency part trivially cannot be generalized in this way similarity to operators belonging to some other special classes was examined too theorem 1 3 is one of the most important results concerning similarity to normal operators therefore we hope that our result will be useful when one wants to investigate similarity questions in the second part of chapter 4 we described all possible asymptotic limits of those contractions that are similar to unitary operators and which act on a 0 dimensional space namely we proved that the positive contraction a b h arises from such a contraction t if and only if it is invertible re a 1 and dim ker a r a i 0 0 next in chapter 5 we examined the commutant mapping of contractions this map ping belongs to those few links which relate the contraction to a well understood operator i e a unitary operator the injectivity of this mapping was investigated of course when t is of class c 1 the associated commutant mapping t is necessarily injective we pro vided an example when the stable subspace of t is non trivial yet t is injective moreover we provided four necessary conditions which has to be fulfilled whenever t is injective one of these conditions is that p t p t d we also proved that certain conditions on the stable component implies that the injectivity of is equivalent to this summary 86 previously mentioned condition we verified that the commutant mapping of quasisimilar contractions are simultaneously injective or not we examined the commutant mapping of orthogonal sums as well and in particular it turned out that t t is injective if and only if t is injective finally we proved that the above mentioned four conditions to gether are still not enough to ensure that the commutant mapping is injective complete characterization was left open finally in chapter 6 we were interested in contractive weighted shifts on directed trees with positive weights this is a recently introduced class 22 which is a very natural generalization of the classical weighted shift operators and it turned out that they are very useful in testing certain problems in our work first we proved that a countable orthogonal sum of backward shift operators with at most one zero weight is always cyclic our second aim was to provide cyclic properties of weighted shift operators on directed trees in order to do this first we examined their isometric asymptotes using cyclic properties of the isometric asymptote we were able to provide necessary and sufficient conditions for cyclicity in the case when the directed tree t is rootless its branching index is 1 and there is at least 1 leaf namely when there are two leaves the operator is always cyclic if there is exactly one leaf then the cyclicity of the weighted shift s is equivalent to the cyclicity of a bilateral shift operator which can be obtained from s very easily there is one more case when the cyclicity of s is an interesting question this is when s is defined on t which is a rootless and leafless directed tree such that the branching index is 1 on t we can find cyclic and non cyclic shifts as well but we could not provide necessary and sufficient conditions in the special case when s is of class c 1 the weighted shift on t has no cyclic vectors we were also interested in the cyclic properties of the adjoint of a weighted shift on a directed tree we showed that not every s is cyclic on the other hand if s is of class c 1 and t has a root then s is cyclic when t is rootless and the branching index is finite then the adjoint of every c 1 class contractive weighted shift on t is cyclic o sszefoglala s disszerta cio

would like to emphasize my thanks to my former mathemat ics teacher in the secondary school pe ter zs ros and my former biology teacher jo zsef baranyai from july 2013 i have been supported by the
