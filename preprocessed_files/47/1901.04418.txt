coexistence of ac and pp spectrum for kicked quasi periodic potentials k bjerklo v and r krikorian abstract we introduce a class of real analytic peaky poten tials for which the corresponding quasi periodic 1 d schro dinger operators exhibit for quasiperiodic frequencies in a set of posi tive lebesgue measure both absolutely continuous and pure point spectrum 1 introduction and results 1 1 quasiperiodic schro dinger operators for x p t r z p przqq z and v r z r a ck function k p n y t 8 u we consider the following 1 d quasiperiodic schro dinger operator hv x l 2 pzq punqnpz pun 1 un 1 v px n qunqnpz we shall call v the potential the frequency and x the phase the spectrum specphv xq of the operator hv x is a nonempty compact subset of r and when is irrational it does not depend on x we shall often denote it by v to investigate the spectral properties of the operator hv x it is often useful to introduce its spectral measure v x this is the probability measure on r defined as follows if i p l 2 pzq i 0 1 are defined by ipnq i n one sets v x p 1 2 qp v x 0 v x 1 q where the probability measures v x i i 0 1 are uniquely defined by z p c z 0 xphv x zq 1 i iy r d v x iptq t z an important question in the theory of quasi periodic schro dinger op erators is to investigate the topological nature of the spectrum v is it a cantor set and the spectral type of the spectral measure v x rk is supported by a chaire d excellence labex mme dii and the project anr bekam anr 15 ce 40 0001 1 ar x iv 1 90 1 04 41 8 v 1 m at h d s 1 4 ja n 20 19 2 k bjerklo v and r krikorian does it have absolutely continuous singular continuous or atomic com ponents in this paper we shall be interested on the possible coex istence of absolutely continuous pure ac and pure point pp com ponents of the spectrum in the following sense there exist disjoint nonempty open intervals iac and ipp such that v x iac is absolutely continuous w r t to lebesgue measure and v x ipp is purely punc tual when this is the case we shall say for short that the spectrum of hv x has disjoint ac and pp components in the preceding questions the regularity and the size of the potential v on the one hand and the arithmetic properties of the frequency on the other hand play an important role let us mention two general results assume that v is of the form v v where v t r is a fixed real analytic function and p r small real analytic potentials eliasson s theorem 12 when is dio phantine dc 1 p q pk lq p z n k l l and when is small enough the smallness depending on the preced ing diophantine condition eliasson has proved that the spectrum of h v x is absolutely continuous his results extends to the case of small smooth potentials v v and to the multifrequency case v td r in the one frequency case d 1 and when v is real analytic bourgain and jitomirskaya 10 proved that the required smallness condition on could be chosen independently of the diophantine condition large real analytic potentials bourgain goldstein theorem 9 see also 13 bourgain and goldstein proved in 9 that there exists 0 pvq 0 and a set of full lebesgue measure depending on v such that for any frequency in this set and any 0 pvq the spectrum of h v 0 is pure point moreover h v 0 satisfies anderson localization all the eigenvalues of h v 0 decay exponentially fast the analytic regularity of v is here essential if v v is only smooth and is diophantine one can only establish the existence of some point spectrum cf 23 16 25 6 a fundamental example in the preceding setting is the case v 2 cosp 2 q one then speak of h v x as the almost mathieu operator amo where the transition between small and large potentials occurs at 1 21 notice that in this case anderson localization of h v 0 for 1 holds for any diophantine frequency a natural question is to provide examples of analytic potentials and frequencies for which the spectrum of the corresponding qp schro dinger operator has both absolutely continuous ac and purely punctual pp coexistence of ac and pp spectrum 3 spectral components natural candidates for such potentials are per turbations of the amo at the critical coupling 1 indeed avila 1 constructed examples of potentials which are real analytic pertur bations of 2 cosp 2 q and for which the spectrum of the corresponding schro dinger operator has both ac and pp components in fact these ac and pp components can be produced in many alternating intervals on the real axis previous examples of quasi periodic potentials with two frequencies where constructed by bourgain 8 for other types of coexistence results we refer to 14 co existence of ac and singular spectrum 7 coexistence of regions of the spectrum with positive lyapunov exponents and zero lyapunov exponents and 27 which elaborates on 7 to give examples of coexistence of ac and pp spec trum and coexistence of ac and sc spectrum 1 2 main results the aim of this paper is to present another type of potentials for which coexistence of ac and pp spectrum holds these potentials are not particularly big they cannot be too small by elias son s theorem 12 but have a peaky shape the sets of admissible frequencies for which our theorems hold have positive lebesgue mea sures and are located close to rational numbers more precisely we define the set p 8 of smooth peaky potentials v p c 8 pt rq by v p p 8 if and only if 1 v 0 2 the support supppv q of v is a proper subset of t 3 v has a unique maximum at some point x 4 and for any x p interiorpsupppv qqztx u one has v 1 pxq 0 for v p p 8 we denote by lpv q the length of the support of v and kpv q maxt v for 0 and k p n we define p pv k q as the set of real analytic potentials rv t r such that v rv ck max 0 l k max xpt p b l pv pxq rv pxqq q we now describe the set which will essentially be our set of admissible frequencies we define for 0 p q p q the set dp qp q dp qp q s p q p q rxdc 1 p 2 3 q where dc 1 p 2 3 q is the set of p t such that pk lq p z n k l 2 l 3 the setdp qp q is a set of positive lebesgue measure for small enough cf lemma 3 1 4 k bjerklo v and r krikorian our main theorem is the following theorem a there exists s 0 p n such that the following holds let v p p 8 and q p n be such that kpv q 10 and lpv q 1 q then there exists 0 such that for any rv p p pv s 0 q there exists a set of frequencies aqprv q of full lebesgue measure in q 1 p 0 dp qp q such that for any p aqprv q the spectrum of hrv 0 has disjoint a c and p p components remark 1 the preceding theorem combined with the acritality result of avila 1 shows that there is a prevalent set ru p pv s 0 q such that for any rv p ru and any p aqprv q hv 0 has no s c spectrum remark 2 let pratpv s 0 q be the subset of all functions of the form p q in p pv s 0 q where p and q are trigonometric polyno mials a simple fubini type argument shows that there exists a set aratq of full lebesgue measure in q 1 p 0 dp qp q such that for all p rv q p aratq pratpv s 0 q the spectrum of hrv 0 has disjoint a c and p p components we can also prove a similar result for a specific class of examples let and k be two positive constants and let vk r z r be the real analytic potential defined by vk pxq k 1 4 sin 2 p xq theorem b assume that k and are large enough then there is a set a 2 t of positive lebesgue measure such that for any p a 2 the operator hvk 0 has both a c and p p spectrum 1 3 dynamics of cocycles and spectral theory the proofs of the preceding theorems are based as is now often the case in the study of 1 d quasi periodic schro dinger operators on the study of the so called family of schro dinger cocycles associated to the operator this is the family of skew product diffeomorphisms p se v q t r 2 p aqpx yq px se v pxqyq where e p r and sw denotes the matrix w 1 1 0 p slp 2 rq the dynamical behavior of the family of cocycles p se v q e p r is closely related to the spectral properties of the family of operators hv x x p t one usually distinguishes two different kinds of dynamical behaviors reducible or almost reducible dynamics the cocycle p se v q is c k reducible k p n y t 8 u if there exists b r 2 z slp 2 rq of class ck such that bp qse v p qbp q 1 is a constant c p slp 2 rq coexistence of ac and pp spectrum 5 or equivalently if p 0 bq p se v q p 0 bq 1 p cq this notion is particularly useful when c is an elliptic matrix because then the iterates p se v q n pn s pnq e v q are bounded in the sense that the products n 1 s pnq e v p q se v p pn 1 q q se v p q are uniformly ck bounded indeed s pnq e v p q bp n q 1 cnbp q an equally important notion is that of almost reducibility the cocycle p se v q is almost reducible if there exists a sequence bn r 2 z slp 2 rq of class ck such that p 0 bnq p se v q p 0 bnq 1 converges to a constant elliptic or parabolic cocycle 1 in many cases almost reducibility of p se v q implies slow growth of the iterates p se v q n in turn the boundedness or the slow growth of the iterates of the cocycles p se v q provides useful spectral informations if this occurs at a point e in the spectrum then assuming diophantine there exists an interval containing e on which the spectrum of hv x is ac for all x p t cf theorem 2 3 non uniform hyperbolicity nuh a cocycle p se v q is non uniformly hyperbolic if its upper lyapunov exponent lep se v q lim n 8 t 1 n ln s pnq e v pxq dx is positive and if it is at the same time not uniformly hyperbolic or equivalently if e p v the theorem of bourgain and goldstein 9 is in fact the statement that if for all e and all the lyapunov exponent of p se v q is positive then the operator hv 0 has pp spectrum for lebesgue a e the same statement holds if the preceding conditions are satisfied for all e and all irrational in some nonempty open intervals proving for a given analytic cocycle that lep se v q is positive is usually done via herman s subharmonicity trick 20 2 to produce mixed spectrum in theorem a one idea is thus to produce ranges of the energy parameter e for which p se v q has a reducible or almost reducible behavior and other ranges for which it has a nuh behavior it turns out that if v is in the class p 8 with lpv q 1 q this is the case for the family of cocycles p se v q q at least if is very close to a rational of the form p q indeed in this case p se v q q will be of the form pq s pqq e v q where for e in some range of parameters one 1 when k we require the convergence to hold on some fixed analyticity band pr ir h hsq z where i 1 2 another method is provided by 26 with less regular potentials but with dio phantine conditions on the frequency and weaker conclusion 6 k bjerklo v and r krikorian has i maxxpt trs pqq e v 2 and for some other range of parameters e ii the image of t by trspqqe v contains strictly r 2 2 s this leads to the study of cocycles that we shall call totally elliptic in case i and regular of mixed type in case ii the relevant theorem attached to case i is theorem 3 1 proved in section 3 by using a method of algebraic conjugation also known as the cheap trick 14 3 we can reduce the analysis of an a priori non perturbative situation to the more classical one of the perturbation of a constant cocycle eliasson s theorem the theorem that allows us to prove positivity of the lya punov exponents in case ii is theorem 4 1 of section 4 the method though it relies on subharmonicity is different in spirit from herman s method and closer to the acceleration theory developed by avila in 1 even if we don t need the full strength of this theory the dynamical analysis in the proof of theorem b uses results of section 3 and herman s subharmonicity trick as a final comment we mention that the current method we use does not allow us to produce many alternating ac and pp components the analysis of a more general situation than ii namely that of cocyles of mixed type which are not regular if the cocycle is not regular this only means that the image of t by trspqqe v contains 2 or 2 is then necessary we defer this analysis to another paper 1 4 on the genesis of the paper the results in the present paper are based on questions that arose when we numerically investigated the lyapunov exponent of the schro dinger cocycle p se vk q with the peaky potential vk pxq k 1 sin 2 p xq when fixing k 5 and taking large the simulations indicated that the potential vk behaves both as a large potential in the region e 2 and as a small potential on regions inside the inter val e 2 more precisely we noted that the lyapunov exponent lep se vk q seems to be positive for e outside r 2 1 2 1 s but in side r 2 2 s it looks like there are values of e for which the lyapunov exponent vanishes see figures 1 and 2 in figure 1 we have also included a plot of the rotation number peq p se vk q this seemed unexpected since the potential is not small we could not ex plain this latter observation by directly applying reducibility results such as eliasson s theorem 12 provided that the numerical ex periments showed a correct picture there had to be some resonance phenomena going on this is where our journey began coexistence of ac and pp spectrum 7 a e lep se vk q on the interval p 3 10 q b e peq on the interval p 3 10 q figure 1 numerical computations of a the lya punov exponent lep se vk q and b the rotation number peq for p 5 1 q 2 k 10 and 10000 our theorem b explains this phenomenon for diophantine very close to 1 2 it would be nice to have an explanation for the golden mean p 5 1 q 2 a number of constant type maybe the renor malization techniques of 4 and 5 can be of some use to tackle this question 2 criteria for ac and pp spectrum 2 1 background 8 k bjerklo v and r krikorian figure 2 numerical computations of e lep se vk q on r 2 2 s for p 5 1 q 2 k 10 and 10000 2 1 1 norms

complex strip pr ir h hsq z we define f h sup zppr ir h hsq z rfpzq we denote by c h ptq the set of all such functions 2 1 2 cocycles a ck k p nyt 8 u quasi periodic cocycle is a map td r 2 px yq px apxqyq where p td and a td slp 2 rq is of class ck if a is a constant map we say that the cocycle p aq is constant and we say that it is respectively elliptic unipotent or hyper bolic if a is respectively elliptic trpaq 2 unipotent trpaq 2 or hyperbolic trpaq 2 two cocycles p aiq i 1 2 are said to be conjugated if there exists a map b pr 2 zqd slp 2 rq of class ck such that p 0 bq p a 1 q p 0 bq 1 p a 2 q or equivalently a 2 p q bp qa 1 p qbp q 1 a cocycle p aq is said to be ck reducible if it can be conjugated to a constant cocycle and ck almost reducible if there exists a sequence of maps bn pr 2 zqd slp 2 rq of class ck coexistence of ac and pp spectrum 9 such that the sequence bnp qap qbp q 1 converges in ck topology 3 to a constant elliptic or unipotent cocycle 4 as n goes to

decomposition 2 r 2 espxq eupxq such that apxqes upxq es upx q and for any v p espxq resp v p eupxq the limit of p 1 n q ln anpxqv when n goes to 8 resp 8 is equal to lep aq when lep aq 0 and the convergence in 1 is uniform the decomposition 2 is then continuous one says that the cocycle p aq is uniformly hyperbolic uh if lep aq 0 and the cocycle p aq is not uh we say it is non uniformly hyperbolic nuh 2 1 4 rotation number a continuous cocycle p aq td r 2 naturally defines a projective cocycle fp aq td s 1 px yq px apxqy apxqy let r s 1 be the projection y pcosp 2 yq sinp 2 yqq if the map a td slp 2 rq is homotopic to the identity there exists a lift fp aq td r px yq px gpx yqq g being continuous of the form gpx yq y px yq where is 1 periodic in y such that pgpx yqq apxqy apxqy if has rationally inde pendent coordinates one can prove 20 that the following limit 3 rp aqpx yq lim n 8 gpf n p aqpx yqq y n exists for all px yq and is independent of px yq this limit is denoted by p aq and its class modulo 1 is denoted by p aq it is independent 3 when k we require the convergence to hold on some fixed analyticity band pr 1 r h hsq z 4 we exclude constant hyperbolic cocycles in this definition just to have nicer statements in the paper 10 k bjerklo v and r krikorian of the preceding construction and is called the fibered rotation number for short the rotation number of the cocycle p aq we extend the preceding definition when d 1 to the case where is rational if 0 the limit rp 0 aqpx yq in equation 3 is defined for any x p t and any y p r is independent on y but then depends on x we define p 0 aq t rp 0 aqpx yqdx when p q is rational pp qq p z n p q 1 we define pp q aq 1 q ppp q aqqq the value of p aq pp q aq mod 1 does not depend on the pre ceding construction 2 1 5 schro dinger cocycles a cocycle of the form p sv q with sv v 1 1 0 where v p ckptd rq is said to be a schro dinger cocycle the family p se v q e p r is called the family of schro dinger cocycles associated to the potential v when has rationally independent coordinates the dynamics of this family of cocycles is intimately related to the spectral properties of the family of schro dinger operator hv x x p td for example e r v if and only if p se v q is a uniformly hyperbolic cocycle another example of such a correspondence is the following define the probability measure v t v xdx then for any e p r the rotation number of p se v q is related to the density of states v ps 8 esq by 4 v ps 8 esq 1 2 p se v q 2 1 6 diophantine conditions for d p n 0 d 1 we denote by dcdp q the set of p td such that pk lq p pzdzt 0 uq z xk y l k 1 for d 1 and small enough this is a set of positive lebesgue measure and the set dcdp q 0 dcdp q is a set of full lebesgue measure an element p td is said to be diophantine if it is in the set dcd d 1 dcdp q we say that p r is in ds p q if k p zdzt 0 u min lpz 2 xk y l k d 2 coexistence of ac and pp spectrum 11 and we set ds y 0 ds p q elements of ds are said to be diophantine with respect to it is easy to check that ds is a set of full lebesgue measure 2 2 criterium for ac spectrum we first recall the following fun damental result by eliasson theorem 2 1 eliasson 12 let d p n p dcdp q and h 0 there exists 0 p hq such that if v p c h pt d rq satisfies v h 0 then the spectral measure v x is ac for any x p td remark 3 strictly speaking eliasson s theorem is proven in 12 for quasi periodic 1 d schro dinger operators on the real line continuous time with diophantine frequency vectors and with small real analytic potentials 5 the analysis of the 1 d discrete quasi periodic schro dinger operators on z with diophantine frequency vector and small real ana lytic potential is done in 17 the proof of the preceding result is based on a kam type inductive procedure that allows for a very precise description of the dynamical properties of the family of schro dinger cocycles p se v q in this per turbative regime these cocycles are always uniformly hyperbolic which is equivalent to e r v or almost reducible the kam type induc tive scheme of 12 17 and the description of the dynamics of the family of schro dinger cocycles can be extended to the smooth case cf 14 and section 3 2 and a close look at eliasson s proof of 12 shows that the spectral result of theorem 2 1 can as well be extended to the smooth case indeed the following more general version of theorem 2 1 is valid theorem 2 2 let d p n p td be diophantine v p c 8 ptd rq and assume that there exists b p c 8 ppr 2 zqd slp 2 rqq such that for e in some interval se e r 0 bp q 1 se v p qbp q is of the form ape e qefep q where e apeq p slp 2 rq and e fep q p c 8 ptd slp 2 rqq are real analytic and such that d de p apeqq pe e q 0 and fep q c 0 oppe e q 2 q then there exists an nonempty open interval i containing e on which v x is non trivial and ac for all x p td 5 the theorem is also true for any real analytic potential and for large energies in the spectrum 12 k bjerklo v and r krikorian the preceding theorem holds true at least on intervals of energies where the cocycle p se v q is almost reducible theorem 2 3 extension of eliasson s theorem let v p c 8 ptd rq and diophantine if for some e p r the cocycle p se v q is c 8 almost reducible then there exists a nonempty open interval iac such that for all x p td the restriction of the spectral measure v x to iac is non trivial and ac proof see the appendix 2 3 criterium for pp spectrum we recall the following criterium for the existence of pp spectrum in some interval due to bourgain and goldstein 9 see also the nice survey 22 theorem 2 4 bourgain goldstein theorem let v p c pt rq ipp and j be two nonempty open intervals assume that for all pe q p ipp pjzpq zqq one has lep se v q 0 then there exists a set bg j lebpjzbgq 0 such that for all p bg the restriction of the spectral measure v 0 to ipp is pp and satisfies anderson localization 3 totally elliptic cocycles we say that a t slp 2 rq is totally elliptic if for any value of x trapxq 2 this is equivalent to the fact that for any x apxq is an elliptic matrix a matrix in slp 2 rq which is conjugated to a rotation matrix different from i if p q is a rational number and 0 k q 1 ap kp qq is totally elliptic we say that the cocycle pp q aq q is totally elliptic for 0 2 we recall that dc 1 p q is the set of p t such that pk lq p z n k l l and we denote by dp qp q dp qp q s p q p q rxdc 1 p 2 3 q lemma 3 1 for any 0 1 2 dp qp q is a set of positive lebesgue measure proof we have to prove that the lebesgue

dedicated to the proof of the following theorem theorem 3 1 there exists s 0 p n for which the following is true let p q be a rational number i r a compact interval with nonempty inte rior and a map i t slp 2 rq pe xq aepxq which is homotopic to the identity c 1 in e and smooth in x assume that for any e p i ppp qq aeq q is totally elliptic the map i r e pp q aeq is not constant then there exists 0 pmaxepi ae cs 0 qq 0 such that for any 0 0 and any p dp qp q there exists a positive lebesgue measure set e i such that for any e p e the cocycle p aeq is reducible conjugated to a constant elliptic

such that the following holds let a p slp 2 rq and 0 be fixed then there exists p a q 0 such that if a cocycle p aq p r c 8 pt slp 2 rqq satisfies 1 p dc 1 p q 2 p aq is diophantine with respect to 3 a a c 0 d 0 and a a cs 0 1 where d 0 c 1 s 0 rc 2 s then p aq is c 8 reducible conjugated to a constant elliptic cocycle if p aq 0 notation till the end of section 3 we denote the cs norm cs by s 3 3 the cheap trick we denote by s 0 r 3 c 2 s where c 2 is the con stant of theorem 3 2 the aim of this section is to prove the following proposition proposition 3 3 cheap trick let p q be a rational

continuous lemma 3 8 assume that the map a is lipschitz with respect to e uniformly in x if there exists e 0 p i for which p ae 0 q is c 0 conjugated to a constant elliptic cocycle then there exists a constant ce 0 such that for any e p i p aeq p ae 0 q ce 0 e e 0 18 k bjerklo v and r krikorian 3 5 proof of theorem 3 1 by assumption there exists a non empty open interval j such that j t pp q aeq e

conjugated to a constant elliptic cocycle provided p aeq p ds p qzt 0 u for some 0 choose such an since y 0 ds p q has full lebesgue mea sure there exists for which m ds p q x j has positive lebesgue measure if f i r is defined by fpeq p aeq lemma 3 8 tells us that for any e p f 1 pmq there exists a constant ce such that for any e 1 p i fpe 1 q fpeq ce e 1 e we apply to this situation the following lemma lemma 3 9 let i j be two intervals of r and f i j be a contin uous map assume that there exists a set m j of positive lebesgue measure such that for every x p f 1 pmq there is a constant cx 0 such that fpxq fpx 1 q cx x x 1 for all x 1 close to x then f 1 pmq has positive measure proof the proof goes by contradiction assume that f 1 pmq has zero measure let kn tx p f 1 pmq cx nu n p z then we have kn kn 1 and n 1 kn f 1 pmq by assumption we also have that each kn is of measure zero for any fixed n 1 we can cover the zero measure set kn by smaller and smaller intervals on kn we have a uniform upper bound on the lipschitz constant of f and thus show that the measure of fpknq must be zero thus it follows that the set n 1 fpknq has zero measure since we have m f n 1 kn n 1 fpknq we hence get the contradiction as a consequence the set of e p i for which p aeq is conjugated to a constant elliptic matrix is of positive lebesgue measure l 4 regular cocycles of mixed type we denote by h pr ir h hsq z and h pr ip 0 hsq z coexistence of ac and pp spectrum 19 4 1 regular cocycles we have already defined the notion of a to tally elliptic map a t slp 2 rq for any x p t apxq is ellip tic changing elliptic to hyperbolic would lead to the notion of a totally hyperbolic map we say that a map a t slp 2 rq is of mixed type if there exists x p t for which trapxq 2 simi larly if a h slp 2 cq is holomorphic and real on 0 we say it is of mixed type if its restriction to t is furthermore we say that a h slp 2 cq is regular if there exists 0 h 1 h and a holo morphic map a h 1 pr ip 0 h 1 sq z c such that for any z p h 1 apzq 1 and t apzq apzq 1 u are the eigenvalues of apzq in that case the spectral radius rspecpaq of a is equal to apzq notice that h 1 h 1 pa hq can be chosen to depend continuously on a p c h pt slp 2 rqq regular we say that a cocycle of the form p 0 aq is regular resp has mixed type if the same is true for a here is a criterium for regularity lemma 4 1 let a p c h pt slp 2 rqq if for any x p t such that trpapxqq 2 one has d dx trapxq 0 then a is regular proof let us fix 0 such that d dx trapxq 0 for trpapxqq 2 we just have to prove that on some h 1 h 1 0 one can follow the eigenvalues of a in a holomorphic way and it is enough to prove that for any z p h 1 apzq has no eigenvalue lying on the unit circle if h 1 is small enough this is clear on tx iy trpaqpxq 2 0 y h 1 u on the other hand if x iy p tx iy trpaqpxq 2 0 y h 1 u then trapx iyq trapxq d dx trapxq piyq opy 2 q but if one eigenvalue of apx iyq is on the unit circle trapx iyq is real and in r 2 2 s thus 0 d dx trapxq piyq opy 2 q d dx trapxqy opy 2 q since d dx trapxq is also real but for 0 y h 1 h 1 small enough this is impossible since d dx trapxq 0 the main result is the following theorem 4 1 let pp qq p z n a p c h pt slp 2 rqq and assume that pp q aqq is regular and of mixed type then there exists 2 2 pa h qq 0 continuous with respect to a p c h pt slp 2 rqq such that for any irrational satisfying 0 pp qq 2 one has lep aq 0 4 2 complex extensions let p pr qq z and a t slp 2 rq a real analytic map admitting a holomorphic extension on a com plex strip h pr r ih ihsq z h 0 for h define a p q ap i q t slp 2 cq as usual lep a q is the limit 20 k bjerklo v and r krikorian of tp 1 nq log 0 k n 1 apx i k q dx notice that when p q is rational this limit coincide with p 1 qq t log rspecp 0 k q 1 apx i kp qqqdx we shall need the following fact lemma 4 2 for any p t the map l r h hs r lep a q is an even convex function proof for z p h n p n the map mn z 1 n log 0 k n 1 apz k q is subharmonic hence the map lnp q tmnp i q is convex as well as limn 8 mnp q it is even because a is real on the real axis though we will not need it we mention that a much stronger and more difficult to prove statement is the following theorem due to a avila 1 theorem 4 2 avila the map l r h hs r lep a q is an even piecewise linear convex function the slopes of which are integer multiples of 2 moreover if p p 0 hq has an open neighborhood on which l p q is linear the cocycle p a p qq is uniformly hyperbolic the slope of l at 0 is called the acceleration 4 3 consequences of regularity when a is regular and 0 one can improve the result of lemma 4 2 lemma 4 3 if a p c h pt slp 2 rqq is regular the map l 0 restricted to r 0 h 1 s is a non negative non decreasing affine function proof indeed in that case for any 0 h 1 l 0 p q t log apx i q dx since ap q is holomorphic on h 1 and non zero log ap q is harmonic on h 1 and hence l 0 is affine on r 0 h 1 s since l 0 is convex and even on r h 1 h 1 s it has to be non decreasing on r 0 h 1 s notice that there exist ra p z and a holomorphic a h 1 c such that for any z p h 1 c apzq expp 2 iraz apzqq by cauchy formula t apx i qdx is independent of let us call a this value we have t log apx i q dx 2 ra a and since this quantity is non negative and non decreasing on p 0 h 1 s we have ra 0 and a 0 when a is of mixed type a 0 when a is regular we can diagonalize a in a holomorphic way coexistence of ac and pp spectrum 21 lemma 4 4 if a p c h pt slp 2 rqqq is regular on h 1 then for any 0 h 1 there exists b p c 8 pt glp 2 cqq such that b p q 1 ap i qb p q d ap i q where we use the notation d diagp 1 q proof let c be the circle pr i q z for any z p c the eigenvalues apzq apzq 1 of apzq are distinct and we can thus define e pzq kerpapzq apzqiq c 2 the corresponding one dimensional complex eigenspaces the maps c q z e pzq p p 1 pcq are smooth and define two smooth complex line bundles e c and e c the existence of a smooth function b c glp 2 cq such that on c one has b p q 1 ap qb p q d ap q is equivalent to the fact that there exist two nonzero smooth sections c q z u pzq p e pzq to conclude we could just argue that any complex fibered bundle over the circle is equivalent to a trivial one see for example 18 but here we can give a direct argument since the manifold c has real dimension 1 p 1 pcq has real dimension 2 and e c p 1 pcq are smooth there exists a complex line p 1 pcq q r 1 2 s r e pc q for each point t p c the affine lines of c 2 e ptq and tpu 1 u 2 q p c 2 1 u 1 2 u 2 1 u intersect in a single point which depends smoothly on t this defines the searched for smooth sections u p q we use the same notations as before lemma 4 5 let 0 and 0 h 1 h p q p q a p c h pt slp 2 rqq

mint apqqp i q 0 it is not difficult to show that the cocycle p a q q is uniformly hyperbolic if q p q is small enough and that its lyapunov exponent is close to leppp q ap i qqqq 22 k bjerklo v and r

know that rlq p q is a convex function and by lemma 4 3 that rl 0 p q is an affine function we now define 1 minp 0 pa 1 3 q 0 pa 2 3 qq and we apply lemma 4 5 for any irrational 0 pp qq 1 rlq p jq rl

and that for any e p i x dpsq x fepx q is homotopic to the identity we also assume that f is lipschitz w r t to the variable e the lipschitz constant being uniform with respect to the variables x and y lemma c 2 if for some e 0 p i there exists b x s 1 continuous w r t px yq such that for every x p x b 1 x is lipschitz with respect to the variable y uniformly in x and such that for any x p x b 1 tx fx e 0 bx py y q then the map e peq pt feq satisfies e p i peq pe 0 q c e e 0 where c lipef lipyb 1 proof let rf x r i x r and rb x r be lifts for f and b and denote f x r i x r px y eq ptx b 1 tx

and using the definition of the rotation number gives the conclusion of the lemma as a consequence of the preceding lemma one gets the following lemma that applies to the case of linear cocycles consider the associ ated projective dynamics lemma c 3 variation of the rotation number let be given i an interval and a smooth map a i td slp 2 rq pe xq aepxq such that for some e 0 p i there exists a continuous b pr 2 zqd slp 2 rq for which p 0 bq 1 p ae 0 q p 0 bq is a constant elliptic cocyle then for any e p i one has p aeq p ae 0 q c e e 0 where the constant c depends only on the c 0 norm of b and on the sup w r t to x of the c 1 norm of of e aepxq coexistence of ac and pp spectrum 33 appendix d proof of theorem 2 3 since p se v q is almost reducible one has e p v and thus there exists e 0 close to e such that p se 0 v q p ds zt 0 u the function e p se v q cannot be constant on an neighborhood of e since e p v cf 4 in particular by theorem 3 2 p se 0 v q is c 8 conjugated to a constant rotation cocycle let i be a nonempty open interval containing e 0 j t p se v q e p iu and define f i r by fpeq p se v q for some 0 the set m ds p q x j has positive lebesgue measure lemma 3 8 tells us that for any e p f 1 pm q there exists a constant ce such that for any e 1 p i fpe 1 q fpeq ce e 1 e by lemma 3 9 we deduce that the set z of e p i for which p se v q is conjugated to a constant elliptic matrix with rotation number in m is of positive lebesgue measure in particular for e p z lp se v q 0 and by a theorem of 11 for lebesgue a e e p z 23 4 sinp 2 p se v qq d p se v q de
