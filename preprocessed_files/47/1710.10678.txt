nonsingular cubic moment problems using techniques that are expected to be useful for higher degree truncated moment problems in particular we apply the theory of recursively determinate moment matrices to deal with a case of rank increasing moment matrix extensions 1 introduction given a doubly indexed finite sequence of real numbers m 00 10 01 m 0 m 1 1 1 m 1 0 m with 00 0 the truncated real moment problem trmp entails seeking necessary and sufficient conditions for the exis tence of a positive borel measure supported in the real plane r 2 such that ij xiyj d i j z 0 i j m when such a measure exists we say that is a representing measure for and that the trmp is soluble there is a parallel truncated complex moment problem tcmp for a finite sequence of complex numbers m 00 01 10 0 m 1 m 1 m 1 1 m 0 with 00 0 and ji ij here tcmp consists of finding a positive borel measure supported in the complex plane c such that ij z izj d 0 i j m it is well known that trmp are tcmp are equivalent for an even integer m cf 4 proposition 1 12 and hence any techniques developed for tcmp are transferable to trmp both problems are simply referred to as the truncated moment problem tmp in a series of papers for the case when m 2 d the first named author and l a fialkow found solutions for various truncated moment problems for instance they obtained complete solutions for m 2 and m 4 cf 1 4 10 9 some solutions are based on matrix positivity and extension combined with a functional calculus to be briefly discussed in section 2 for the columns of the associated moment matrix this matrix is defined as follows for a real moment sequence 2 d of even degree the moment matrix m d m d 2 d is given copyright 2016 by the tusi mathematical research group date received xxxxxx revised

as well as a solution to the truncated matrix moment problem a solution to the cubic complex moment problem when m 3 was given in 11 we know from 4 proposition 1 12 that the complex and real truncated moment problems are equivalent in the sense that there exists a bridging map that allows one to translate the hypotheses and conclusions for tcmp into similar hypotheses and conclusions for trmp and vice versa our approach here however focuses on the real cubic moment problem and analyzes it in its own right in this note we consider cubic real moment problems and present an alternative solution to the nonsingular case i e m 1 invertible see section 3 for the formal definition our idea is to extend the initial data 3 to an even degree 4 for which the associated moment matrix m 2 has rank 3 or 4 we then prove that m 2 is a flat extension of m 1 or is a flat extension of a 4 4 submatrix or admits a flat extension m 3 in all three cases we find a finitely atomic representing measure for 3 we anticipate that the present work will contribute to our understanding of higher degree moment problems beginning with the quintic moment problem we also expect that solutions to odd degree moment problems will be applied to solve the subnormal completion problem studied in 8 2 preliminaries when we build a moment matrix m 2 out of a cubic finite sequence the lower right hand 3 3 block will include all quartic moments which will need to remain undefined to obtain our main results we will choose appropriate quartic moments and show that m 2 has a representing measure in order to describe this process in detail we need to review basic tmp notation and results pertaining to the even degree case the nonsingular cubic binary moment problem 3 necessary conditions in order to discuss basic necessary conditions for the existence of a measure let be a representing measure of the even degree moment sequence 2 d first we recall that 0 p x y 2 d i j k l aijakl xi lyj k d i j k l aijakl i l j k if and only if m d 0 let pk denote the set of bivariate polynomials in r x y whose degree is at most k and let cm d denote the column space of m d for k d we now define an assignment from pk to cm d given a polynomial p x y ij aijx iyj we let p x y ij aijx iy j so that p x y cm d which defines the above mentioned functional calculus we also let z p denote the zero set of p and define the algebraic variety of by v v p x y 0 deg p d z p 2 1 if p denotes the column vector of coefficients of p then we know that p x y m d p as a consequence p x y 0 if and only if p ker m d another necessary condition we will use is supp v and r rank m d card supp v cardv this condition is called the variety condition 1 in addition if p is any polynomial of degree at most 2 d such that p v 0 then the riesz functional must satisfy p p d 0 which is referred to as consistency of the moment sequence the main results in 6 state that the above mentioned conditions together with consistency are sufficient for solubility in the extremal case r v moreover in 6 the authors showed that consistency cannot be replaced by the weaker condition that m d is recursively generated rg that is p x y 0 pq x y 0 for each polynomial q with deg pq d in summary positive semidefiniteness alone is sufficient to solve the quadratic moment problem d 1 1 however for d 1 the solubility of tmp requires more for instance the solution of the quartic moment problem d 2 requires positive semidefiniteness the variety condition and the rg property this last property requires that the moment matrix be recursively generated cf 1 4 10 flat extensions we recall that m d is said to be flat if rank m d rank m d 1 that is m d is a rank preserving positive extension of m d 1 in this case m d has a unique rank m d atomic measure furthermore it is known that if m d has a positive extension m d k for some k z which in turn admits a flat extension m d k 1 then has a rank m d k atomic measure 3 theorem 1 5 this result is referred to as the flat extension theo rem it is probably the most efficient concrete solution to tmp even though the construction of an extension is usually difficult for a high degree tmp we will use the flat extension theorem in the proof of our main result thus we need to briefly describe the process for building a flat extension since a moment matrix extension m d 1 of m d can be written as m d 1 4 r curto and s yoon m d b d 1 b d 1 c d 1 for some rectangular matrices b d 1 and c d 1 we can adapt a classical result given by j l smul jan in the search for a positive m d 1 theorem 2 1 smul jan s theorem 14 let a b c be matrices of complex numbers with a and c square matrices then a a b b c 0 a 0 b aw for some w c w aw moreover rank a rank a c w aw remark 2 2 when the extension a in theorem 2 1 has the same rank as a we say that a is a flat extension of a besides satisfying this theorem an extension m d 1 must maintain the moment matrix structure that is the c block must be hankel this condition makes generating flat extensions quite difficult in many instances we now discuss how we can find an explicit formula for a representing measure suppose m d admits a positive extension m d k for some k z that has a flat extension m d k 1 thus has a rank m d k atomic measure and let r rank m d k the flat extension theorem says that the algebraic variety v of m d k 1 consists of exactly r points and we may write v x 1 y 1 xr yr denote the vandermonde matrix v as v 1 x 1 y 1 x 2 1 x 1 y 1 y 2 1 x d k 1 y d k 1 1 xr yr x 2 r xryr y 2 r x d k r y d k r 2 2 if b t 1 tr is the basis for the column space of m d k and if vb is the submatrix of v with columns labeled as in b then we can find the densities by solving v t b 1 2 r t t 1 t 2 tr t 2 3 finally we have r k 1 k xk yk degree one transformations we briefly review a tool that will allow us to convert the given moment problem into a simpler one this tool is known as the invariance of moment problems under degree one transformations the complex version is provided in 4 we adapt the notation in 4 to obtain a real version for a b c d e f r with bf 6 ce let x y 1 x y 2 x y a bx cy d ex fy for x y r if denotes the riesz functional associated with then given 2 d we build a new equivalent moment sequence 2 d ij given by ij i 1 j 2 0 i j 2 d we immediately check that p p for every p pd the nonsingular cubic binary moment problem 5 proposition 2 3 4 cf proposition 1 7 invariance under degree one transfor mations let m d and m d be the moment matrices associated with and resp and let jp p p pd the following statements hold i m d jtm d j ii j is invertible iii m d 0 m d 0 iv rank m d rank m d v the formula establishes a one to one correspondence between the sets of representing measures for and which preserves measure class and cardinality of the support moreover supp supp vi m d admits a flat extension if and only if m d admits a flat extension we will now apply proposition 2 3 to a cubic real binary moment sequence 3 00 10 01 20 11 02 30 21 12 03 with 00 0 our strategy is to enlarge 3 to 4 by adding new undetermined moments of degree 4 this extended finite sequence has an associated moment matrix m 2 as we will see in the sequel it is enough to consider the case when m 2 is normalized that is m 1 is the identity matrix for the case when m 1 is singular can be dealt with easily using the results in 1 and 2 we thus assume that 00 1 and that the principal 2 2 and 3 3 minors of m 1 d 2 and d 3 resp are strictly positive a calculation using mathematica 15 reveals that d 2 2 10 20 d 3 02 2 10 2 01 10 11 2 11 2 01 20 02 20 consider now the degree one transformation x y a bx cy d ex fy where a 01 20 10 11 d 2 d 3 b 11 01 10 d 2 d 3 c d 2 d 3 d 10 d 2 e 1 d 2 and f 0 observe that bf ce 1 d 3 6 0 through this transformation and using 4 proposition 1 7 any positive semi definite m 2 with a nonsingular m 1 can be translated to 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 30 21 12 0 0 1 21 12 03 1 30

will require a key result from the theory of recur sively determinate moment matrices 7 which we now briefly describe we first recall that a moment matrix m d is recursively determinate if there are column dependence relations in m d of the form xn p x y p pn 1 2 5 y m q x y q pm m n and q has no y m term 2 6 where pk denotes the subspace of polynomials in r x y whose degree is less than or equal to k one of the main results in 7 follows lemma 2 4 7 corollary 2 4 with d n m 2 so that d n m 2 assume that m 2 is positive semidefinite and admits column relations of the form 2 5 and 2 6 with n m 2 then m 2 admits a flat extension m 3 we recall that in general the solubility of a quartic moment problem requires the variety condition however lemma 2 4 says that the variety condition is superfluous if a positive semidefinite m 2 with invertible m 1 has only two column relations x 2 p x y and y 2 q x y where p and q are linear polynomials in such a case m 2 has a flat extension m 3 and therefore a 4 atomic representing measure it follows that the pair of equations x 2 p x y and y 2 q x y has exactly 4 common real roots 3 cubic binary moment problems as we have indicated before the nontrivial cases of the cubic binary moment problem arise when the submatrix m 1 of 3 is nonsingular moreover as noted in 12 the positive semidefiniteness ofm 1 is always a necessary condition for the existence of a representing measure thus in the sequel we focus on cubic binary moment problems with m 1 positive definite when this happens we say that 3 is a nonsingular cubic binary moment sequence main results using the degree one transformation introduced in section 2 if 3 is a nonsingular cubic binary moment sequence we may always assume without loss of generality that 3 1 0 0 1 0 1 a 0 a 1 a 2 a 3 and we may write m 2 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 a 0 a 1 a 2 0 0 1 a 1 a 2 a 3 1 a 0 a 1 40 31 22 0 a 1 a 2 31 22 13 1 a 2 a 3 22 13 04 3 1 where 40 31 22 13 and 04 are undetermined new moments we will prove that the extended 4 obtained from 3 by adding the quartic moments 40 31 22 13 and 04 admits a representing measure for appropriate choices of the new moments as a result 3 also admits a representing measure the smallest cardinality of supp will be 3 in some cases and 4 in others the nonsingular cubic binary moment problem 7 using theorem 2 1 we first determine under what conditions the extended matrix m 2 will be a flat extension of m 1 first to ensure the positive semidefiniteness of m 2 and if we let w b 2 the upper right hand 3 3 block of m 2 we see that c 2 the lower right hand 3 3 block of m 2 must satisfy the inequality c 2 w tm 1 w with equality characterizing flatness now w t m 1 1 w w tw 1 a 20 a 2 1 a 0 a 1 a 1 a 2 1 a 0 a 2 a 1 a 3 a 0 a 1 a 1 a 2 a 2 1 a 2 2 a 1 a 2 a 2 a 3 1 a 0 a 2 a 1 a 3 a 1 a 2 a 2 a 3 1 a 2 2 a 2 3 3 2 consequently m 2 is a flat extension of m 1 if and only if 40 1 a 2 0 a 2 1 3 3 31 a 0 a 1 a 1 a 2 3 4 13 a 1 a 2 a 2 a 3 3 5 04 1 a 2 2 a 2 3 and 3 6 k 1 a 0 a 2 a 1 a 3 a 2 1 a 2 2 0 3 7 condition 3 7 is equivalent to the commutativity of the matrices defined in 12 we are now ready to prove our first result theorem 3 1 let 3 be a nonsingular cubic binary moment sequence let k be as in 3 7 and assume that k 0 then 3 admits a 3 atomic representing measure proof from the discussion preceding the statement of theorem 3 1 the new quartic moments 40 31 13 and 04 must be defined using 3 3 3 7 resp as for 22 we must use 1 a 0 a 2 a 1 a 3 which in this case equals a 2 1 a 2 2 because k 0 with these definitions we easily conclude that m 2 is a flat moment matrix extension of m 1 which gives the desired result when k 6 0 it is not possible to select new quartic moments so that m 2 is a flat extension of m 1 therefore any positive semidefinite moment matrix extension m 2 will satisfy rank m 2 4 nevertheless the following theorem shows that it is always possible to choose a set of quartic moments such that rank m 2 4 once those moments have been appropriately chosen the extended moment matrix m 2 will admit a flat extension m 3 and therefore a 4 atomic representing measure for 4 which is also a representing measure for the initial data sequence 3 theorem 3 2 let 3 be a nonsingular cubic binary moment sequence let k be as in 3 7 and assume that k 6 0 then 3 admits a 4 atomic representing measure proof we will divide the proof into two cases k 0 and k 0 case 1 k 0 as in the proof of theorem 3 1 let 40 31 13 and 04 be given by 3 3 3 7 resp since k 0 the positivity of m 2 will be 8 r curto and s yoon preserved if we let 22 1 a 1 a 3 a 2 a 4 with this choice of 22 the proposed extended matrix m 2 will be a positive semidefinite moment matrix and such that the block c 2 differs from w t m 1 1 w in just the 2 2 entry as a result rank m 2 4 a simple calculation now reveals that x 2 1 a 0 x a 1 y y 2 1 a 2 x a 3 y we now know thatm 2 is positive semidefinite and recursively determinate and by lemma 2 4 m 2 admits a 4 atomic representing measure it follows that 3 also admits a 4 atomic representing measure case 2 k 0 here our strategy is to allow the rank to increase as we transi tion fromm 1 to the compression ofm 2 to the first 4 rows and columns this requires making the column x 2 linearly independent of the columns 1 x and y in m 2 it is straightforward to observe that this can be easily accomplished by letting 40 2 a 2 1 a 2 2 with this definition in hand we now postulate that m 2 be a flat extension of its compression to the first 4 rows and columns a calculation using mathematica reveals that one can accomplish this by defining three of the remaining quartic moments as follows 31 a 1 a 2 a 2 a 3 22 a 2 2 a 2 3 13 a 2 a 3 a 3 a 4 having chosen these moments we now use theorem 2 1 to determine the re maining quartic moment 04 since we wish to make m 2 a flat extension of its above mentioned compression a calculation using mathematica immediately yields 04 2 a 4 1 2 a 0 a 2 a 2 0 a 2 2 2 a 2 1 a 2 2 a 4 2 2 a 1 a 3 2 a 0 a 1 a 2 a 3 a 2 3 a 2 1 a 2 3 2 a 21 2 a 0 a 2 1 a 2 a 2 2 2 a 0 a 3 2 2 a 3 1 a 3 2 a 1 a 2 2 a 3 3 8 as a result in m 2 we now have xy a 1 x a 2 y 3 9 and y 2 p 11 p 2 x p 3 y p 4 x 2 3 10 for suitable real scalars p 1 p 2 p 3 p 4 which depend upon a 0 a 1 a 2 a 3 moreover p 4 k we will now build a flat moment matrix extension m 3 of m 2 this will prove that m 2 admits a 4 atomic representing measure a fortiori 3 also admits a 4 atomic representing measure just as in case 1 above to define m 3 we aim to preserve the property rg first we observe that the columns 1 x and y in m 3 are obtained from those columns in m 2 by adding suitable cubic and quartic moments moreover the columns xy and the nonsingular cubic binary moment problem 9 y 2 are defined using 3 9 and 3 10 while the columns x 2 y xy 2 and y 3 are obtained via the functional calculus from 3 9 and 3 10 for instance x 2 y a 1 x 2 a 2 xy a 1 x 2 a 2 a 1 x a 2 y a 2 a 1 x a 2 2 y a 1 x 2 and y 3 p 1 y p 2 xy p 3 y 2 p 4 x 2 y p 1 y p 2 a 1 x a 2 y p 3 p 11 p 2 x p 3 y p 4 x 2 p 4 a 2 a 1 x a 2 2 y a 1 x 2 it follows that both x 2 y and y 3 are linear combinations of the columns 1 x y and x 2 now to define xy 2 one can use either 3 9 or 3 10 however property rg requires that both definitions of xy 2 be compatible in other words the expressions xy 2 a 1 xy a 2 y 2 a 2 p 11 a 2 1 a 2 p 2 x a 1 a 2 a 2 p 3 y a 2 p 4 x 2 obtained using 3 9 and xy 2 p 1 x p 2 x 2 p 3 xy p 4 x 3 p 1 a 1 p 3 x a 2 p 3 y p 2 x 2 p 4 x 3 obtained using 3 10 must be identical since p 4 k 6 0 we immediately get x 3 1 p 4 a 2 p 11 a 2 1 a 2 p 2 p 1 a 1 p 3 x a 1 a 2 y a 2 p 4 p 2 x 2 3 11 which we can then use to define the column x 3 close examination of 3 11 at the level of the fourth row in m 3 leads to a formula for the quintic moment 50 this value must then be inserted in the seventh row of x 2 to complete the definition of x 2 in m 3 as a result in the new moment matrix m 3 we have exhibited each cubic column as a linear combination of columns associated with monomials of degree at most 2 this means that m 3 is a flat extension of m 2 as desired the proof is now complete remark 3 3 the quartic moment 04 defined by 3 8 is nonnegative being a diagonal entry of the positive semidefinite matrix m 2 one can say more however by appealing to the theory of semidefinite programming sdp as is well known a polynomial f p 2 d is a sum of squares if and only if f z tqz for some square matrix q 0 where z is the vector of monomials of degree less than or equal to d if we let f f a 0 a 1 a 2 a 3 04 1 and y 1 a 2 a 3 a 2 1 a 2 2 a 0 a 2 a 1 a 3 a calculation using mathematica reveals that f 0 if and only if ytry 0 where r 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 3 12 10 r curto and s yoon since r is a flat extension of its 3 3 compression to the first three rows and columns it is clear that r 0 it
