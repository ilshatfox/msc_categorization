starting point of the present work was the guess hinted by the authors in their paper we will resist the temptation of stating things in a greater generality than needed that bader muchnik s theorem and its consequences hold in a much more general setting than the one of closed riemannian manifolds with strictly negative curvature one of the authors of this paper a boyer generalized bader mu chnik s theorem to discrete isometry groups of proper cat 1 spaces having non arithmetic length spectrum finite bowen margulis sullivan measure and ahlfors regular patterson sullivan conformal density of dimension see 6 this covers convex cocompact groups with non arithmetic spectrum as well as finite volume locally symmetric spaces of rank one but does not cover complete finite volume riemannian manifolds with pinched negative curvature see the interesting exam ples from 13 recall that the length spectrum is non arithmetic if by definition the subgroup of the real line generated by the lengths of the closed geodesics of the quotient space is not cyclic and that a compact locally cat 1 space has an arithmetic length spectrum if and only ergodic boundary representations 5 if it is a finite graph with edge lengths rationally dependent 28 thm 4 in the case the cat 1 space is the cayley graph with all edges of length 1 of the free group on n letters all closed geodesics in the wedge of n circles of length 1 have integral length hence the spectrum is obviously arithmetic and the general theory does not apply never theless a direct counting argument 9 allows to prove bader muchnik s theorem in this case as well following the same lines of ideas as bader and muchnik l garncarek was able to prove that the boundary rep resentation associated to a patterson sullivan measure of a gromov hyperbolic group is irreducible 16 in the same vein the irreducibil ity of some boundary representations associated to gibbs measures has been established in 8 in the unpublished note a brief presentation of property rd 2006 e breuillard speculates that a special case of bader muchnik s theo rem should also hold true for lattices in semisimple lie groups of higher rank and that the proof should easily follow from the work of gorod nik and oh 20 more precisely breuillard asks if the quasi regular representation g p of a connected non compact semisimple lie group g with finite center on

results and ideas among quasi regular representations defined by measurable actions of a locally compact second countable group g on a second countable borel space b preserving the class of a borel probability measure we single out in definition 2 1 those representations which are ergodic with respect to some family en en where each en g is relatively compact borel and en en b is borel and with respect to some function f l b the definitions are coined so that a quasi regular representation which is ergodic with respect to a family en en and sufficiently many functions f l b has to be irreducible see proposition 2 8 the 8 a boyer g link and ch pittet existence of such a family implies the equidistribution of the sets en en in b see remark 2 7 the ergodicity of the quasi regular represen tation associated to an action is strictly stronger than the ergodicity of the action see the example after remark 2 7 we show that the ergodicity of a quasi regular representation does not depend too much on the chosen family en g one is free to work with balls annuli cones sub cones see subsection 2 3 theorem 2 2 gives sufficient conditions for the quasi regular repre sentation of a unimodular locally compact second countable group g endowed with a length function and acting on a borel metric proba bility space b d to be ergodic with respect to a symmetric family en g borel maps en en b and functions f l b belong ing to the closure of the subspace generated by characteristic functions of borel subsets u b such that u 0 as explained in the previous section if g is a connected non compact semisimple lie group g with finite center with maximal compact sub group k cartan decomposition ka k minimal parabolic p and m z a k we consider its furstenberg poisson boundary b g p k m and the boundary map b ka k k m defined a e on g as b k 1 ak 2 k 1 m if the real rank of g equals one the furstenberg poisson boundary is identified with the visual bound ary of the symmetric space g k the boundary map b is defined on g k and coincides with the map b c x 0 explained above if g is a lattice we apply theorem 2 2 to the intersections of with some cones made bi k invariant in g and deduce using theo rem 3 1 the ergodicity of the quasi regular representation of a lattice in a semisimple lie group theorem 1 1 the boundary maps bt are the restrictions of b k 1 ak 2 k 1 m to the t truncation of the im age by the exponential map of a weyl chamber made bi k invariant the irreducibility of the restriction of the quasi regular representation g p to any lattice follows from a general result in 12 according to proposition 2 8 this is also a straightforward corollary of theorem 1 1 applying theorem 1 1 or bader muchnik s theorem to the case rankrg 1 brings essentially the same information although the original state ment of bader and muchnik applies only to uniform lattices specializing theorem 1 1 by choosing twice the vector 1 g p l 2 g p ergodic boundary representations 9 and applying the definition of the wot one recovers the equidistribu tion of the radial k component of the cartan decomposition ka k of lattice points in the furstenberg poisson boundary for every con tinuous function f on g p lim n 1 bn bn f b g p f b d b the analogous statement with the iwasawa decomposition g kan instead of the cartan decomposition and the boundary map b kan km instead of b k 1 ak 2 k 1 m follows from 18 theorem 1 we refer the reader to 19 theorem 7 2 for the equidistribution of both k components of the cartan decomposition ka k of lattice points with an explicit control on the rate of convergence for lipschitz functions specializing theorem 1 1 by choosing f 1 g p l g p and applying the results of subsection 2 3 confirms breuillard s guess men tioned above 1 5 key points from the proofs questions and speculations the proof of theorem 2 2 splits into two parts the first part consists in the identification of the limit by which we mean the convergence lim n m 1 u en en 1 v 1 w u w v see formula 1 below and section 2 below for notation which is established for sufficiently many characteristic functions the second part amounts to prove the uniform bound sup n m 1 b en op for the family of operators m 1 b en b l 2 b assuming both parts proved the main conclusion of theorem 2 2 that is the ergodicity of the representation is easily deduced from density arguments and the following lemma whose proof is straightforward lemma 1 2 from l to l 2 let h be a hilbert space and let v be a dense subspace let an be a uniformly bounded sequence of b h if for all v w v lim n anv w 0 then lim n an 0 in the weak operator topology 10 a boyer g link and ch pittet this twofold approach is a core idea in 2 it works in strictly nega tive curvature we show that it also works in higher rank theorem 2 2 may be viewed as an attempt to formalize this twofold approach in a general frame flexible enough to cover different geometric situations although semisimple lie groups over non archimedean local fields and their lattices and s arithmetic groups are not touched in this paper we believe that a similar approach applies to those groups as well also it would be interesting to obtain effective forms of convergence with a good control on the error term reference 19 looks helpful for both purposes we now briefly indicate how the identification of the limit respectively the uniform boundedness is obtained in illustrative cases 1 5 1 identification of the limit as explained in subsection 3 4 below in the case of symmetric spaces the first hypothesis of theorem 2 2 namely the inequality g 1 b 1 b b d b en g r g hr l g follows from fatou type theorems see 32 31 and 29 for the nor malized square root of the poisson kernel p 0 g g 1 b g an important condition in generalized fatou theorems is the conver gence type weak and or restricted tangential admissible we handle this technical issue by first proving the ergodicity of with respect to sub cones of a weyl chamber in theorem 3 1 the restrictions imposed by the sub cones may then be removed thanks to the results of subsec tion 2 3 as shown in 6 lemma 5 1 prop 7 4 the above inequality is true for discrete isometry groups of proper cat 1 spaces with ahlfors regular patterson sullivan conformal density of dimension and although the proof relies on geometric properties of negatively curved spaces it could be deduced from a fatou type theorem for the normalized square root of the poisson kernel 6 prop 7 4 it would be interesting to develop the boundary theory with fatou type theorems for the normalized square root of the poisson kernels for more cat 0 spaces and groups the second hypothesis of theorem 2 2 namely the inequality lim sup n 1 vol en en 1 u en g 1 1 v en g dg u v ergodic boundary representations 11 is satisfied thanks to counting results for closed negatively curved manifolds it follows from a result which goes back to g margulis thesis 2 theorem c 1 for cat 1 spaces and groups with finite bowen margulis sullivan measure and non arithmetic spectrum it follows see 6 from a result of t roblin 27 thm 4 1 1 for free groups a direct counting gives the result 9 and it would be interesting to understand how the normalizing constant in 27 thm 4 1 1 varies with 0 in the case of the tree covering the wedge of two circles of lengths 1 and for locally symmetric spaces of finite volume it follows as explained below in subsection 3 5 from the wave front lemma and counting results from 20 1 5 2 uniform boundedness bounding operator norms of averages of unitary operators may be a difficult problem this is well illustrated by valette s conjecture about property rd for uniform lattices in higher rang semisimple lie groups see 10 in 2 bader and muchnik ap ply the riesz thorin interpolation theorem and reduce their l 2 uniform bound problem to one about l norms following their idea we ex plain in subsection 2 4 below how the problem boils down to bounding cocyles averages of the type m 1 b e 1 b b 1 vol e e c g b 1 2 g dg in cat 1 spaces the concept of sampling from 2 and geometric inequalities 6 4 4 uniform boundedness lead to the wanted uniform upper bound for the l norms an alternative proof of the uni form bound on the operator norms consists in applying property rd to the quasi regular representation this works for gromov hyperbolic groups see 8 uniform boundedness 4 4 for lattices in semisimple lie groups the upper bound is proved in two steps the first step proposition 3 5 is an explicit computation of the cocycle averages they are all equal to 1 this was first observed in 9 lemma 2 6 the second step proposition 3 6 which goes back to 7 is a discretiza tion of the cocycles averages it works because the cocycles and the harish chandra functions are stable in the sense of subsection 2 5 1 6 acknowledgements we are grateful to h oh for explanations about her paper with a gorodnik 20

space and let be a borel probability measure on b let g be a locally compact second countable group let dg denote a left haar measure on g we assume that g acts continuously on b and that the action preserves sets of measure zero for all l 2 b and all g g we have g gb c g b d b g b d b where c g b dg 1 b d b is the radon nikodym derivative at the point b of the transformation defined by g 1 the formula g b g 1 b c g 1 b 1 2 defines a unitary representation g u l 2 b called the quasi regular representation associated to the action of g on b see 3 proposition a 6 1 and lemma a 6 2 for the strong con tinuity of we will always assume that for any relatively compact open set u g sup g u dg d l b equivalently for any relatively compact open set u g sup g u g 1 b l b this condition says that there is a uniform bound on the contraction or dilatation of any borel set in b under the action of any compact part of g it is satisfied in each example mentioned in the introduction the boundary b is a compact space and the radon nykodym derivative is given by a cocycle c g b continuous in g b the harish chandra function associated to the action of g on b is the coefficient of defined by the characteristic function 1 b l 2 b of b namely g g 1 b 1 b b c g 1 b 1 2 d b ergodic boundary representations 13 let l 1 b in some special cases see subsection 3 4 below it is fruitful to consider p 0 g g 1 b g as the normalized square root of a poisson kernel it brings a useful link with potential theory 2 2 averages of unitary operators let e g be a relatively compact borel subset and let vol e g 1 e g dg let e e b be a borel map if is as above let b l 2 b denote the banach space of the bounded operators on l 2 b let f b c be a borel bounded function if vol e 6 0 we may consider the average m f e e 1 vol e e f e g g g dg as the function g 7 1 e g f e g vol e g belongs to l 1 g dg it follows see 17 ch xi 7 25 1 2 that m f e e b l 2 b let p 1 b b l 2 b be the orthogonal pro jection onto the complex line of constant functions on b and letm f b l 2 b be the multiplication operator defined by f definition 2 1 ergodic quasi regular representations for each n n let en en be as above we say that the representation is ergodic relative to the family en en and the map f if lim n m f en en m f p 1 b in the weak operator topology that is if for all l 2 b lim n 1 vol en en f en g g g dg 1 b f theorem 2 2 fatou counting and uniform boundedness imply er godicity of the representation let g u l 2 b be a quasi regular representation such that for any relatively compact open set u g sup g u g 1 b l b 14 a boyer g link and ch pittet suppose g is unimodular let l be a length function on g and let d be a distance on b inducing the topology of b let en e 1 n be a sequence of relatively compact borel subsets of g such that limn vol en let en en b be a sequence of borel maps assume the following two conditions hold 1 for each r 0 there is a non increasing function hr 0 0 such that lims hr s 0 and such that for all n n and for all g en g 1 b 1 b b d b en g r g hr l g 2 for all borel subsets u v b such that u v 0 lim sup n 1 vol en en 1 u en g 1 1 v en g dg u v then for all borel subsets u v w b such that u v w 0 1 lim n m 1 u en en 1 v 1 w u w v assume moreover sup n m 1 b en 1 b let h l b be the smallest subspace containing all characteristic functions 1 u with u b borel such that u 0 and let h l b denote its closure then is ergodic with respect the family en en and any f h remark 2 3 notice that if f 1 b then the choices of the maps en are irrelevant in this case we say that the representation is ergodic relative to the sets en we have lim n men p 1 b hence p 1 b belongs to the von neumann algebra generated by g in the algebra b l 2 b remark 2 4 the definition of an ergodic quasi regular representa tion generalizes the definition of an ergodic measure preserving trans formation indeed if t is a measure preserving transformation of the probability space b the associated quasi regular representation z u l 2 b is the koopman representation the constant function 1 b is fixed by hence is constant equal to 1 the choice ergodic boundary representations 15 en k z 0 k n 1 defines the birkhoff sum men and it is well known that lim n men p 1 b in the weak operator topology if and only if the measure preserving transformation t is ergodic proposition 2 5 if the quasi regular representation of g on l 2 b is ergodic relative to a family en then the action of g on b is ergodic proof let e be a borel subset of b such that for all g g we have ge e let ec denote the complement of e in b obviously g 1 e 1 ec 0 for all g g hence if is ergodic relative to a family en then 0 men 1 e 1 ec p 1 b 1 e 1 ec e e c remark 2 6 if is ergodic relative to a family of couples en en and a borel bounded function f then lim n m f en en 1 b f in the weak topology of l 2 b hence if this holds for a family of borel bounded functions f which is dense in l 2 b then 1 b is a cyclic vector of remark 2 7 if is ergodic relative to a family of couples en en for all continuous f we may specialize the convergence to the case 1 b to obtain the equidistribution of en en b relative to lim n 1 vol en en f en g dg b f b d b or in the case g is discrete and the haar measure is the counting measure lim n 1 en en f en b f b d b if e b is a borel g invariant subset with 0 e 1 then the orthogonal projection p 1 e commutes with g so ker p 1 e is a non trivial closed invariant subspace for hence the ergodicity of the action is a necessary condition for the irreducibility of it is not a sufficient one the diagonal action of sl 2 z on the product of two copies of the circle at infinity of sl 2 r so 2 r equipped with the product of the angular measure is ergodic see 23 theorem 17 16 a boyer g link and ch pittet and the introduction of 11 but the involution permuting the coordi nates of the circles at infinity defines a non trivial invariant subspace of the associated quasi regular representation the next proposition shows that the ergodicity of the representation is strictly stronger than the ergodicity of the action because it implies the irreducibility of the representation proposition 2 8 ergodic representations are irreducible assume that for each bounded borel function f b c from a dense family in l 2 b containing 1 b there is a sequence en en relative to which is ergodic then is irreducible proof as mentioned in the above remarks the vector 1 b is cyclic and the orthogonal projection p 1 b onto the complex line it generates be longs to the von neumann algebra generated by g the irreducibil ity is then a consequence of the following classical lemma which is easy to prove lemma 2 9 let be a unitary representation on a hilbert space h suppose there exists a cyclic vector w h such that the orthogonal projection pw onto the line it generates belongs to the von neumann algebra generated by g then is irreducible 2 3 ergodicity relative to balls annuli cones and subcones proposition 2 10 ergodicity relative to cones and subcones let be a quasi regular representation of g as above let f b c be a borel bounded map assume that for each n n we are given relatively compact borel subsets bn and cn bn of g of non zero haar measure and borel maps bn bn b and cn bn cn cn b assume that lim n vol bn cn vol bn 0 assume moreover that the operators m f bn bn and m f cn cn are uni formly bounded then the following conditions are equivalent 1 the representation is ergodic relative to the couples bn bn and the map f 2 the representation is ergodic relative to the couples cn cn and the map f proof as l b l 2 b is dense and the operators are uni formly bounded lemma 1 2 applies hence it is enough to prove that for all l b lim n m f bn bn m f cn cn 0 ergodic boundary representations 17 we have m f bn bn m f cn cn 1 vol bn bn cn f bn g g g dg vol cn vol bn vol bn vol cn cn f cn g g g dg writing each bounded function f as the sum of its positive and negative real part and its positive and negative imaginary part we obtain m f bn bn m f cn cn 43 f vol bn bn cn g 1 b 1 b g dg 43 f vol bn vol cn vol bn vol cn cn g 1 b 1 b g dg 43 f 2 vol bn vol cn vol bn proposition 2 11 ergodicity relative to balls and annuli let be a quasi regular representation of g as above let f b c be a borel bounded map assume that for each n n we are given relatively compact borel subsets bn and cn of g of non zero haar measure and borel maps bn bn b and cn cn b assume that for each n the set bn n k 1 ck is the disjoint union of the sets c 1 ck cn and that bn restricted to ck equals ck 1 assume limn vol bn 1 vol bn exists and is strictly smaller than 1 if is ergodic relative to the bn bn and f then it is ergodic relative to the cn cn and f 2 assume limn vol bn if is ergodic relative to the cn cn and f then it is ergodic relative to the bn bn and f proof let l 2 b suppose limn vol bn 1 vol bn c 1 and that is ergodic relative to the bn bn and f we have m f bn bn vol bn 1 vol bn m f bn 1 bn 1 vol cn vol bn m f cn cn 18 a boyer g link and ch pittet hence letting n tend to infinity we obtain m f p 1 b c m f p

the open r neighborhood of e in b recall that the boundary e of a subset e in a topological space b is the intersection of its closure with the closure of its complement e e b e and that it is borel in the case e is borel for the sake of clarity we recall in the following proposition two facts standard and easy to prove we will use about metric borel spaces proposition 2 18 let b be a borel space with a probability mea sure we assume the topology inducing the borel structure is defined by a distance d let e b be a borel set 1 if e 0 then limr 0 e r e 2 the set r 0 e r 6 0 is at most countable 2 7 bounded operators preserving positive functions let b be a borel space with a probability measure we assume the topology inducing the borel structure is defined by a distance d suppose for each

on g for each n let en g be a relatively compact borel subset and let en en b be a borel map assume lim n vol en assume that for each r 0 there exists a function hr 0 0 with the following properties 1 hr is non increasing 24 a boyer g link and ch pittet 2 lims hr s 0 3 n n g en g 1 b 1 b b d b en g r g hr l g then for any borel subset u b the operators m 1 un m 1 u en en 1 vol en en 1 u en g g g dg

it is enough to check that the hypotheses of lemma 2 19 are satisfied the operator m f en en is obviously positive if f is and m 1 b en en 1 b 1 b 1 it follows from proposition 2 21 that the second assumption in lemma 2 19 is satisfied namely for all borel subsets u w b with d u w 0 lim n m 1 u en en 1 b 1 w 0 26 a boyer g link and ch pittet let us check that the first assumption in lemma 2 19 is satisfied namely that for all borel subsets u v b with u v 0 lim sup n m 1 u en en 1 v 1 b u v from proposition 2 21 we deduce that for all r 0 lim sup n m 1 u en en 1 v 1 b lim sup n 1 vol en en 1 u en g 1 1 v r en g dg hence according to proposition 2 18 for any 0 we may choose r such that 0 r and such that v r 0 applying the above inequality with the chosen r and the second assumption of the theorem we obtain lim sup n m 1 u en en 1 v 1 b u v r as r may be chosen arbitrarily small in the above inequality and as v 0 we deduce that lim sup n m 1 u en en 1 v 1 b u v since according to proposition 2 18 limr 0 v r v this ter minates the proof of the first part of the theorem to prove the second statement in the theorem we notice first that linearity and the first part of the theorem imply that for any h h and for all borel sets v w in b with v w 0 we have 2 lim n mh en en 1 v 1 w 1 v 1 b h 1 w applying lemma 2 14 it is easy to deduce that 2 also holds for any h h to finish the proof of the theorem we check that lemma 1 2 applies the density hypothesis is satisfied the topology on b is induced by a metric hence the probability borel measure is regular it implies that the smallest subspace of l 2 b containing the characteristic functions of borel subsets of b whose boundaries have zero measure is dense the uniform boundedness hypothesis is satisfied thanks to lemma 2

recall the notation f g for limt f t g t 1 proposition 3 3 counting lattice points in sectors let 0 as t we have t t gt proof notice that if 0 then for all t 0 t t t gt hence in proving the proposition we may assume is small for all t 0 gt t t gt 1 hence the proposition will be proved if we show that lim t gt t gt 0 to that end we introduce the following notation for any 0 and r 0 we define a r h a h r a ar let us choose t 0 1 sin 2 elementary trigonometry shows that a 2 t 0 1 a 1 a t 0 as is small the closure of a 2 t 0 1 in a lies at positive distance of the walls of the weyl

neighborhood v exp a 1 of e in a the conclusion of theorem 2 1 from 20 is the existence of a neighborhood o of e in g with the following property any g k exp h l with k l k and h a 2 t 0 1 satisfies go 1 k exp h v k 32 a boyer g link and ch pittet in other words 3 ka 2 t 0 1 ko 1 ka 2 t 0 1 v k choosing o smaller if needed we may assume that it satisfies the following additional properties o o 1

deduce theorem 3 1 from theorem 2 2 let us check that all the hypotheses of theorem 2 2 are ergodic boundary representations 35 satisfied in the case of a lattice in a non compact connected semisimple lie group with finite center as is small we can apply lemma 3 2 hence the first condition is satisfied applying lemma 3 4 we see that the second condition is satisfied proposition 3 6 implies that sup

whose closure contains the continuous functions on k m 3 8 proofs of theorem 3 1 and theorem 1 1 notice that for large enough we have a a and therefore t b t ka tk katk t hence theorem 1 1 is a special case of theorem 3 1 we now prove theorem 3 1 proof applying proposition 3 6 and lemma 2 14 we deduce that for any 0 and any continuous function f on k m sup t 1 m f t op suppose 0 is given let 0 be small enough so that we can apply the already proven special case of theorem 3 1 hence for any continuous function f on k m the quasi regular representation is ergodic relative to t b t it follows from proposition 3 3 that lim t t t t 0 hence we can apply proposition 2 10 we deduce that for any continu ous function f on k m the quasi regular representation is ergodic relative to t b t
