radius of the generalized spherical aluthge transform 14 references 22 1 introduction let h be a complex infinite dimensional hilbert space let b h denote the algebra of bounded linear operators on h and let t b h for t v t the canonical polar decomposition of t we let t t t 1 2 v t 1 2 denote the aluthge transform of t 1 it is well known that t is invertible if and only if t is invertible moreover the spectra of t and t are equal over the last two decades considerable attention has been given to the study of the aluthge transform cf 2 10 22 24 27 29 33 45 moreover the aluthge transform has been generalized to the case of powers of t different from 1 2 3 9 21 40 and to the case of commuting d tuples of operators 4 5 18 20 23 30 31 recall that for t 0 1 the generalized aluthge transform of t is t t t tv t 1 t the special instance of t 1 is known as the duggal transform defined as t d t v see 24 31 in this paper we will focus on the generalized spherical aluthge transform of commuting d tuples which we now describe let t t 1 td be a commuting d tuple of operators on h and consider the canonical polar decomposition of the column operator dt t 1 td 1 1 that is dt dv p h h h 1 2 where p dt t 1 t 1 t d td is a positive operator on h and dv v 1 vd is a joint partial isometry from h to h h then dv dv is the orthogonal projection onto the initial space of the partial isometry dv which in turn is kerdt ker t 1 ker td kerp we define the spherical polar decomposition of t by t v 1 p vdp 1 3 cf 16 18 30 31 we will also define the 2 norm of t by t 2 p for 0 t 1 the generalized spherical aluthge transform of t is the d tuple t t p tv 1 p 1 t p tvdp 1 t 1 4 2 we remark that when t 1 2 resp t 1 we get the spherical aluthge resp duggal transform sph t resp t d of t that is 1 2 t sph t p 1 2 v 1 p 1 2 p 12 vdp 1 2 resp 1 t t d pv 1 pvd 1 5 in 18 20 it was shown that the spherical aluthge transform t 1 2 respects the com mutativity of the pair the key step was the identity vipvj vjpvi for all i j 1 d using this one can prove that t t is commutative whenever t is for all 0 t 1 cf 2 1 below a fact also observed in 21 however the d tuple v is in general not commutative before we state our main results we pause to recall the notation we will use for several spectral systems we shall let t denote the taylor spectrum te the taylor essential spectrum p the point spectrum the left spectrum also known as the approximate point spectrum r the right spectrum and h the harte spectrum h r theorem 1 1 let t t 1 td be a commuting d tuple of operators on h and let 0 t 1 then t t t t t as a consequence we have r t t rt t where rt denotes the joint spectral radius i e r t sup 2 1 2 d 2 1 d t t 1 6 and similarly for rt t t theorem 1 2 let t t 1 td be a commuting d tuple of operators on h and let 0 t 1 then te t t te t moreover the fredholm index satisfies index t t index t for all te t theorem 1 3 let t t 1 td be a commuting d tuple of operators on h then for 0 t 1 the following statements hold i p t t p t ii t t t iii h t t h t iv assume t 0 then r t r t t r t 0 v more generally if k and k denote the s lodkowski s spectral systems 38 then we have k t t k t k 0 d and k t k t t k t 0 k 0 d 3 the first inclusion in theorem 1 1 iv can be proper as the following example shows example 1 4 for 0 t 1 consider the commuting pair t u 0 where u denotes the adjoint of the unweighted unilateral weighted shift acting on 2 z with canonical orthonormal basis e 0 e 1 the polar decomposition of u is u i e 0 where e 0 denotes the orthogonal projection onto the 1 dimensional subspace generated by e 0 it is clear that the pair t has positive part p i e 0 moreover u i e 0 u therefore t t i e 0 tu i e 0 1 t 0 i e 0 u 0 u e 0 e 1 0 for all t 0 1 this pair is unitarily equivalent to 0 u 0 and it follows that r t t 0 t 0 t 0 0 0 for all t 0 1 here t denotes the closed unit circle on the other hand r t t 0 as we will see in section 3 the key ingredient in the proof of theorem 1 1 is a careful analysis of the role of p in establishing an isomorphism between the koszul complexes of t and t t as a consequence we shall see in section 3 that p also enters in the proof of theorem 1 3 we now turn our attention to the spectral radius of t for n 1 t yamazaki proved in 45 that the aluthge transform of an operator t can be used to calculate the spectral radius of t via iteration concretely r t limn n t where n denotes the n th iterate of we first extend this result to the case of single operators and the generalized aluthge transform theorem 1 5 for 0 t 1 there exists st 0 such that r t st t and lim n n t t st theorem 1 6 for 0 t 1 we have lim n n t t r t 1 7 we now extend the above results to the case of commuting d tuples for t 1 2 theorem 1 8 was first proved in 23 theorem 1 7 let t t 1 td be a commuting d tuple of operators on h for t 0 1 and n 1 the sequence n t t 2 n 1 satisfies rt t n 1 t t 2 n t t 2 t 2 theorem 1 8 let t t 1 td be a commuting d tuple of operators on h for 0 t 1 we have rt t lim n n t t 2 1 8 4 the organization of the paper is as follows in section 2 we collect notation and termi nology needed throughout the paper and we also list some standard results needed for our proofs we devote section 3 to the spectral results which allow us to compare the spectral pictures of t and t t for all t 0 1 in section 4 we discuss the multivariable version of the spectral radius formula for the generalized spherical aluthge transform we extend the recent result of k feki and t yamazaki 23 for t 1 2 to the general case of 0 t 1 we also discuss what happens when t 1 the proof of theorem 1 8 is rather subtle in that we need to study in great detail the behavior of the norms of t its generalized spherical aluthge transform t t the successive iterates n t t and the norms of the respective powers of the form n t t k 2 there is a rather fascinating interplay between the norms of the powers and the norms of the iterates 2 notation and preliminaries let t t 1 t 2 be a commuting pair of operators on h and consider the koszul complex of t on h that is k t h 0 h t 1 t 2 h h t 2 t 1 h 0 recall that p t 1 t 1 t 2 t 2 and that the generalized aluthge transform is given by t t p tv 1 p 1 t p tv 2 p 1 t for 0 t 1 where v 1 v 2 is the joint partial isometry in the polar decomposition of t 1 t 2 we know that v 1 pv 2 v 2 pv 1 p t 1 t 2 t 2 t 1 0 2 1 and therefore the operator c v 1 pv 2 v 2 pv 1 vanishes on the range of p since c also vanishes on the kernel of p because kerp ker v 1 ker v 2 we easily conclude that c 0 a direct consequence of this is the commutativity of t t for all 0 t 1 in an entirely similar way one can prove that for a commuting d tuple t t 1 td the identities vipvj vjpvi 2 2 always hold 1 i j d and therefore the generalized spherical aluthge transform t t is commutative for all t 0 1 it follows that we can form two koszul complexes one for t and one for t t with boundary maps denoted by d 0 t d 1 t dd 1 t and by d 0 t t d 1 t t dd 1 t t respectively k t h 0 h d 0 t h h d 1 t d d 2 t h h d d 1 t h 0 and k t t h 0 h d 0 t t h h d 1 t t d d 2 t t h h d d 1 t t h 0 for the precise definition of the koszul complex and its boundary maps the reader is referred to 14 41 43 observe that d 0 t dt as defined in 1 1 5 from the definition of t t we readily obtain d key identities 1 p t p t d 0 t d 0 t t p t 2 p t p t d 1 t d 1 t t p t p t d p tdd 1 t dd 1 t t p t p t these identities establish for each 0 t 1 a co chain homomorphism t k t h k t t h this homomorphism will allow us to compare at each stage the exactness of one complex with the exactness of the other we will do this in section 3 remark 2 1 observe that for 0 t 1 the fixed points of the generalized spherical aluthge transform are the spherically quasinormal d tuples these are the d tuples for which p commutes with each ti or equivalently with each vi for i 1 d for if 0 t 1 and t t t we must have p tvi vip t p 1 t 0 for i 1 d let ci p tvi vip t i 1 d when t 1 ci vanishes on the range of p 1 t and therefore it vanishes on the range of p for all i 1 d since it also vanishes on the kernel of p we conclude that ci 0 i 1 d it follows that vi commutes with p for all i 1 d when t 1 the commutativity of vi and p i 1 d is obvious we now recall the definitions of taylor and taylor essential spectrum and of fredholm index definition 2 2 a commuting d tuple t t 1 td is said to be taylor invertible if its associated koszul complex k t h is exact at each stage the taylor spectrum of t is t t 1 d cd k t h is not exact t is said to be fredholm if all the homology quotients in k t h are finite dimensional this implies in particular that the boundary maps have closed range the taylor essential spectrum is the set te t cd t is not fredholm if given k 0 1 d one only requires that the koszul complex be exact at the last k 1 stages d k d k 1 d 1 d we obtain z s lodkowski s spectral systems k these spectral systems lie between the right spectrum and the taylor spectrum that is r 0 1 d 1 d t similarly if given k 0 1 d one only requires that the koszul complex be exact at the first k 1 stages 0 1 k 1 k together with the closed range of dk t we obtain the spectral system k these spectral systems lie between the left spectrum and the taylor spectrum that is 0 1 d t if z denotes one of the above mentioned spectral systems we will say that t is z invertible whenever 0 0 0 z t for instance we will refer to t as being taylor invertible or left invertible or harte invertible and so on 6 j l taylor showed in 41 that if h 6 0 then t t is a nonempty compact subset of the polydisc of multiradius r t 1 r td where r ti is the spectral radius of ti i 1 d as a consequence if t t then 2 d p for i 2 r ti 2 t i ti for every i 1 d and therefore 2 2 d i 1 t i ti d p 2 however one can do better for consider the elementary operator mt b h b h given as mt x d i 1 t i xti x b h we know from 15 that mt 1 1 d d t t as a result if t t we have 22 r mt mt p 2 thus r t p t 2 for additional facts about these joint spectra the reader is referred to 12 15 38 39 42 as shown in 13 14 the fredholmness of t can be detected in the calkin algebra q h b h k h here k denotes the closed two sided ideal of compact operators on h we also let b h q h denote the quotient map concretely t is fredholm on h if and only if the d tuple of left multiplication operators l t l t 1 l td is taylor invertible when acting on q h in particular t is left fredholm on h if and only if l t is left invertible on q h given a commuting d tuple t by the spectral picture of t denoted sp t we will refer to the collection of the sets t t te t k t k t and h t for all k 0 1 d together with the index function defined on the fredholm domain of t that is the complement in cd of te t our strategy to describe the spectral picture of t t will partially rely on the theory of criss cross commutativity for pairs of d tuples of operators acting on h given two d tuples a and b we say that a and b criss cross commute if aibjak akbjai and biajbk bkajbi for all i j k 1 d observe that in this definition we do not assume that a or b is commuting we now let ab a 1 b 1 adbd and ba b 1 a 1 bdad it is an easy exercise to prove that if a and b criss cross commute then each of ab and ba is commuting now fix a commuting d tuple t and a real number t 0 1 and let a a 1 ad v 1 p 1 t vdp 1 t and b b 1 bd p t p t then ab t and ba t t moreover the commutativity of t implies that a and b criss cross commute using 2 2 it follows that t t is also commuting we now briefly describe unilateral weighted shifts since we use them to generate examples for n n 0 a bounded sequence of positive real numbers called weights let w shift 0 1 2 z 2 z be the associated unilateral weighted shift defined by w en nen 1 all n 0 where en n 0 is the canonical orthonormal basis in 2 z as we noted in example 1 4 u shift 1 1 is the unweighted unilateral shift and for 0 a 1 we will let sa shift a 1 1 we will also need 2 variable weighted shifts consider the nonnegative quadrant z 2 k k 1 k 2 z 2 k 1 0 and k 2 0 7 and the hilbert space 2 z 2 of square summable complex sequences indexed by z 2 the canonical orthonormal basis for this space is ek k z 2 observe that 2 z 2 is canonically isometrically isomorphic to the hilbert space tensor product 2 z 2 z via the map ek 7 ek 1 ek 2 k k 1 k 2 z 2 assume now that we are given two double indexed positive bounded sequences k k z 2 where k z 2 we can then define the 2 variable weighted shift w t 1 t 2 by t 1 e k 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 e k 1 1 k 2 and t 2 e k 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 e k 1 k 2 1 for all k z 2 we have t 1 t 2 t 2 t 1 k 1 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 1 k 1 k 2 2 3 given two unilateral weighed shifts w and w a trivial way to build a 2 variable weighted shift is to let k 1 k 2 k 1 and k 1 k 2 k 2 for all k z 2 it is not hard to see that in this case w w i i w for additional facts about 2 variable weighted shifts the reader is referred to 16 19 for a given t the calculation of t t is not always straightforward even for relatively simple forms of the components of t we now present an example which helps to visualize the type of complications one may encounter example 2 3 let h 2 z 2 z let t t 1 t 2 i u u i and fix 0 t 1 then r t r t t t d observe first that p 2 i e 0 2 e 0 where e 0 is the projection onto e 0 and e 0 i e 0 from the functional calculus for p we get p i e 0 2 e 0 p t i e 0 2 t 2 e 0 and p 1 t i e 0 2 1 t 2 e 0 also observe that kerp 0 let v 1 i 1 2 u then v 1 p i 1 2 u e 0 2 e 0 i 1 2 u e 0 2 u e 0 i u e 0 i u let v 2 u e 0 1 2 e 0 then v 2 p u e 0 1 2 e 0 e 0 2 e 0 u i thus 8 v 1 v 1 v 2 v 2 i 2 1 2 u 2 1 2 u u e 0 2 1 2 e 0 u e 0 2 1 2 e 0 i 1 2 u u u u e 0 1 2 e 0 i 1 2 e 0 i e 0 1 2 e 0 i i therefore v 1 v 2 is a noncommuting joint isometry and ker v 1 ker v 2 0 kerp it follows that v 1 p v 2 p is the spherical polar decomposition of t 1 t 2 let 0 t 1 then p tv 1 p 1 t i e 0 2 t 2 e 0 i 2 1 2 u i e 0 2 1 t 2 e 0 i e 0 2 t 2 e 0 2 t 2 u e 0 i 2 t 2 e 0 u e 0 u on the other hand p tv 2 p 1 t i e 0 2 t 2 e 0 u e 0 2 1 2 e 0 i e 0 2 1 t 2 e 0 u i thus r t t r 2 t 2 e 0 u e 0 u d we now need to study the right spectrum of w t 2 t 2 e 0 u e 0 u a moment s thought reveals that w t is the adjoint of sa shift a 1 1 where a 2 t 2 then r w t r s a sa t where the bar over denotes complex conjugation it follows that r t t t d 2 4 on the other hand r t r i u u i r u r u t d 2 5 therefore by 2 4 and 2 5 we have r t t r t 3 the spectral picture of the generalized spherical aluthge transform in 29 i b jung e ko and c pearcy proved that for t b h 1 2 t t subsequently m cho i jung and w y lee also proved that 1 t t 10 it is also known that for r 0 and t v t b h t and t v t r have the same spectrum 26 lemma 5 if we put r 1 and t then t and t t have the same spectrum for all 0 t 1 as a consequence we obtain r t r t t for all 0 t 1 where r t denotes the spectral radius 9 in what follows we will extend these results to the case of commuting d tuples of operators on h we will first look at taylor invertibility which requires an analysis of the exactness of the koszul complexes k t h and k t h for cd we will split the discussion into two cases i 0 and ii 6 0 we will first consider the case 0 3 1 taylor invertibility when 0 given a commuting d tuple t t 1 td we begin with a key connection between the invertibility of p and the koszul complex homomorphism t introduced on page 6 right before definition 2 2 we recall that t is left invertible if and only if p is invertible theorem 3 1 let t be a commuting d tuple let k t h be its associated koszul com plex and let p be the positive factor in the polar decomposition of d 0 t that is p t 1 t 1 t dtd assume that 0 t 1 the following statements are equiva lent i t is left invertible ii p is invertible iii t t is left invertible proof i ii this is straightforward ii iii assume that p is invertible then the map t is an isomorphism of koszul complexes we also know that t is left invertible that is the koszul complex k t h is exact at stage 0 and the range of d 0 t is closed since t is an isomorphism we must therefore have that k t t h is exact at stage 0 and the range of d 0 t t is closed thus t t is left invertible iii ii observe that d 0 t d 0 t p 1 t v 1 pv 1 v d pvd p 1 t by assumption d 0 t is left invertible and therefore p 1 t v 1 pv 1 v d pvd p 1 t is onto it follows that p 1 t is onto which implies that p is invertible remark 3 2 careful study of the proof of theorem 3 1 reveals that left invertibility can be replaced by the invertibility associated with any of the spectral systems k for 0 k d for if 0 k t then 0 0 t which means that t is left invertible and therefore p is invertible and the two koszul complexes are isomorphic we leave the details to the reader we now deal with right invertibility which will also include invertibility relative to the spectral systems k theorem 3 3 let t be a commuting d tuple let k t h be its associated koszul complex and let p be the positive factor in the polar decomposition of d 0 t assume that 0 t 1 and consider the following statements i t is right invertible ii p is invertible iii t t is right invertible then iii ii and iii i the implication i iii is not true in general cf example 1 4 10 proof iii ii assume that t t is right invertible that is the boundary map dd 1 t t is onto now recall that dd 1 t t dd 1 t t p t d i 1 vip 2 1 t v i p t since t 0 it follows that p t is onto and therefore p is invertible iii i assume that t t is right invertible by what we just proved p is invertible it follows that the two koszul complexes are isomorphic and therefore t is right invertible remark 3 4 just as in the case of remark 3 2 the proof of theorem 3 3 reveals that right invertibility can be replaced by the invertibility associated with any of the spectral systems k for 0 k d for if 0 k t t then 0 0 t t which means that t t is right invertible and therefore p is invertible and the two koszul complexes are isomorphic again we leave the details to the reader corollary 3 5 let t be a commuting d tuple let 0 t 1 and let t t be the gener alized spherical aluthge transform of t the following statements are equivalent i t is taylor invertible ii t t is taylor invertible proof assume first that t is taylor invertible then it is left invertible and by the orem 3 1 the operator p is invertible as a result the koszul complexes k t h and k t t h are isomorphic since k t h is exact so is k t t h therefore t t is taylor invertible conversely assume that t t is taylor invertible and therefore right invertible by theorem 3 3 p is invertible and it follows that the two koszul complexes are isomorphic then t is taylor invertible as desired corollary 3 6 let t 0 t 1 and t t be as above the following statements are equivalent i t is harte invertible ii t t is harte invertible proof assume first that t is harte invertible then it is left invertible and by theorem 3 1 the operator p is invertible as a result the koszul complexes k t h and k t t h are isomorphic it follows that t t is harte invertible conversely assume that t t is harte invertible and therefore right invertible by theorem 3 3 p is invertible and it follows that the two koszul complexes are isomorphic then t is harte invertible as desired the following corollary is a simple consequence of the preceding results we omit the proof corollary 3 7 let t 0 t 1 and t t be as above and fix 0 k d the following statements hold i 0 k t t 0 k t ii if in addition t 1 then 0 k t t 0 k t 3 2 fredholmness when 0 continuing with the case 0 we will now study the fredholmness of t and t t by now the analogues of theorems 3 1 and 3 3 should be 11 natural we will give an abridged proof of theorem 3 8 and leave the proof of theorem 3 9 to the interested reader theorem 3 8 let t be a commuting d tuple and let k t h and p be as above assume that 0 t 1 the following statements are equivalent i t is left fredholm ii p is fredholm iii t t is left fredholm sketch of proof from page 6 recall the co chain homomorphism t k t h k t t h induced by p t let denote the calkin map and let p t denote the corresponding element in q h at the calkin algebra level t becomes t a co chain homomorphism induced by l p t between the koszul complexes k l t q h and k l t t q h where t and t t have the obvious definitions and l denotes the d tuple of left multiplications by the coordinates of ii iii assume that p is fredholm then p t is fredholm and therefore p t is an invertible element of q h it follows that the associated map t is an isomorphism since t is left fredholm l t is left invertible and therefore l t t is left invertible which implies that t t is left fredholm theorem 3 9 let t be a commuting d tuple and let k t h and p be as above assume that 0 t 1 and consider the following statements i t is right fredholm ii p is fredholm iii t t is right fredholm then iii ii and iii i the implication i iii is not true in general corollary 3 10 let t 0 t 1 and t t be as above the following statements are equivalent i t is fredholm ii t t is fredholm 3 3 taylor invertibility when 6 0 we now consider the various forms of invertibility of t when 6 0 from page 7 recall that two not necessarily commuting d tuples a and b criss cross commute if aibjak akbjai and biajbk bkajbi for all i j k 1 d recall also that under this condition both ab and ba are commuting lemma 3 11 cf 6 7 assume that a and b criss cross commute then t ba 0 t ab 0 3 4 fredholmness when 6 0 here we need the analogue of lemma 3 11 for the taylor essential spectrum lemma 3 12 cf 6 7 34 35 assume that a and b criss cross commute then te ba 0 te ab 0 12 moreover for 0 6 te t one has index t t index t 3 5 the spectral picture of t and t t we are now ready to prove theorems 1 1 1 2 and 1 3 which we will restate as a single result encompassing the various spectral systems theorem 3 13 let t t 1 td be a commuting d tuple of operators on h and let 0 t 1 then taylor t t t t t as a consequence we have r t t rt t where rt denotes the joint spectral radius taylor ess te t t te t index the fredholm index satisfies index t t index t for all te t other s i p t t p t ii t t t iii h t t h t iv assume t 0 then r t r t t r t 0 v more generally if k and k denote the s lodkowski s spectral systems we have k t t k t k 0 d and k t k t t k t 0 k 0 d proof let t t t if 0 we know that t t is not taylor invertible by corollary 3 5 t is not taylor invertible and therefore t t similarly 0 t t 0 t t t assume now that 6 0 and recall that t ab and t t ba for a v 1 p 1 t vdp 1 t and b p t p t cf page 7 by lemma 3 11 the taylor invertibility of t t is equivalent to the taylor invertibility of t this completes the proof of the equality of t t t and t t to deal with the taylor essential spectra we can adapt the above arguments replacing taylor invertibility by fredholmness corollary 3 5 by corollary 3 10 and lemma 3 11 by lemma 3 12 respectively in terms of the fredholm index the results in 34 are based on an isomorphism between the homology spaces of k t t h and k t h which guarantees the equality of the fredholm indices away from 0 however the fredholm 13 index is continuous on the complement in cd of t t 13 14 and integer valued and therefore index t t index t must also hold whenever 0 t t as for other spectral systems we can use remarks 3 2 and 3 4 together with the fact that the results in 6 7 34 35 are based on isomorphisms of the koszul complexes or of the related homology spaces however for the case of the point spectrum p and 0 we can simply invoke the condition ker t 1 ker td kerp ker v 1 ker vd for instance if 0 6 x h and t 1 x tdx 0 then px 0 and v 1 x vdx 0 which readily implies that p tv 1 p 1 tx p tvdp 1 tx 0 as a result p t p t t conversely if p tv 1 p 1 tx p tvdp 1 tx 0 for some 0 6 x h then p must not be one to one otherwise we get a contradiction and therefore t 1 x tdx 0 we conclude this section with a simple application of theorem 3 13 corollary 3 14 let t t 1 td be a commuting d tuple of operators on h and let 0 t 1 assume that 0 r t t r t then 0 t t t proof first recall that the two koszul complexes for t and t t are isomorphic when p is invertible by assumption the koszul complexes are not isomorphic so p is not invertible let xn n 1 be a sequence of unit vectors in h such that pxn 0 as n since t 1 it follows that p tvip 1 txn 0 as n for all i 1 d this means that t t is not bounded below that is 0 t t but 0 is also in t because p is not bounded below it follows that 0 t t t as desired 4 joint spectral radius of the generalized spherical aluthge transform in this section we will extend k feki and t yamazaki s proof of the spectral radius formula for the spherical aluthge transform in d variables d 1 and t 1 2 23 to the case of the generalized spherical aluthge transform d 1 and 0 t 1 first we present a simple example that shows that the spectral radius formula 1 8 cannot be extended to the case of t 1 even for d 1 example 4 1 consider an operator t b h with polar decomposition t v p where the partial isometry v satisfies the algebraic equation v 2 i it is clear that v must be unitary and v v recall that in general the polar decomposition of the adjoint of t is given by t v q where q tt thus in the case at hand we must have q v pv and t pv it follows that 1 t pv t and therefore 1 1 t 1 t 1 v q qv v pv v v pv 2 v p t we conclude that n 1 t t n is even t n is odd as a consequence n 1 t t for all n 1 which implies that limn n 1 t t on the other hand within this collection of operators r t may be smaller than 14 t and therefore r t 6 limn n 1 t for a concrete example where r t t let h c 2 let 1 k r and let tk 1 k k 1 with polar decomposition tk v p 0 1 1 0 k 1 1 k as we mentioned in the introduction t yamazaki proved for single operators that r t limn n 1 2 t subsequently t y tam 40 building on d wang s 44 simplified proof of yamazaki s result extended the spectral radius formula to the case of 0 t 1 under the assumption that t is invertible very recently k feki and t yamazaki have extended these results to the case of d 1 and t 1 2 23 in what follows we will extend the spectral radius formula to all commuting d tuples and all 0 t 1 first we need to record three operator inequalities that can be traced back to the work of e heinz 25 and a mcintosh 36 for two of them the formulation below is taken from 32 lemma 4 2 36 let h be a complex hilbert space and let a b x b h then a xb aa x 1 2 xbb 1 2 4 1 lemma 4 3 25 32 theorems 1 and 2 let h be a complex hilbert space and let a b x b h then for t 0 1 atxbt axb t x 1 t 4 2 and atxb 1 t ax t xb 1 t 4 3 we will also need the multivariable analogue of the classical spectral radius formula established by v mu ller and a soltysiak in 1992 for this first recall that the joint spectral radius of a commuting d tuple is given by r t sup 2 t t cf 8 11 37 it is straightforward to see that r t t also given a d tuple t and an integer k 1 we will let t k denote the dk tuple defined inductively as follows t 1 t t 2 t 1 t 1 t 1 t 2 t 1 td t 2 t 1 t 2 t 2 tdt 1 tdt 2 tdtd 4 4 t k 1 tt k lemma 4 4 37 let t be a commuting d tuple of hilbert space operators then r t lim k t k 1 k 2 15 as a way to initiate our discussion recall that for t b h and 0 t 1 one has t t t 21 40 briefly p tv p 1 t pv t v p 1 t by 4 3 and it is always true that pv v p p t v p as a consequence the sequence of iterates of t t has decreasing norms and therefore lim n t t 2 exists and is majorized by t 2 the other ingredient that enters into the 1 variable proof is the comparison between the norms of the integer powers of two consecutive iterates n 1 t t k 2 and n t t k 2 our goal is to provide the appropriate analogues in the case of d variables for the reader s convenience we now restate theorem 1 8 theorem 4 5 let t t 1 td be a commuting d tuple of operators on h for 0 t 1 we have rt t lim n n t t 2 4 5 to formulate a strategy to prove this result we remind ourselves that there are three elements that should enter into the proof i an application of mu ller and soltysiak s joint spectral radius formula 37 which will require a good handle on the powers of t its generalized spherical aluthge transform t t and its iterates ii the equality of the taylor spectra of t and any iterate n t t and iii the asymptotic behavior of the norms of the iterates the first goal is to establish the inequality r t n t t 2 for all t 0 1 n 1 k 1 once this is done we will look carefully at the behavior of n t t k 2 as a function of the parameters t n and k our proof will be structured around nine key steps each of independent interest we will record them in a series of nine auxiliary lemmas lemma 4 6 cf 23 lemma 4 5 for k 1 t k 1 2 t 2 t k 2 proof by 4 4 we have t k 1 2 2 d i 1 ik 1 1 t i 1 t ik 1 tik 1 ti 1 d

known inequality x ax x x a for a 0 and x arbitrary in the present situation x is the column vector with operator entries which are products of t 1 td and a is the diagonal operator matrix with constant diagonal entry d i 2 ik 1 1 t i 2 t ik 1 tik 1 ti 2 lemma 4 7 for 0 t 1 t t 2 t 2 proof on the hilbert space hd h h d orthogonal summands consider the operators a diag p p b a and x v 1 0 0 0

and xb t 2 it follows that t t 2 t t 2 t 1 t 2 t 2 as desired lemma 4 8 cf 23 lemma 4 3 for t 1 2 for 0 t 1 and k 1 t t k 2 t k 2 proof we imitate the proof of lemma 4 7 this time letting a b x act on the space hdk thus a diag p p b a and x is a dk by dk operator matrix with the only nonzero entries appearing in the first column the entries in that column are given by vi 1 p pvik for i 1 ik 1 d it is easy to show that t t k 2 atxb 1 t we can once again appeal to 4 3 to obtain t t k 2 atxb 1 t ax t xb 1 t 4 6 17 in the special case of t 1 2 one can use instead lemma 4 2 as done in 23 now ax 2 x

the content of lemma 4 8 when applied to n t t corollary 4 11 for 0 t 1 and k n 1 n t t k 2 2 t t k 2 t t k 2 t k 2 proof immediate from lemmas 4 8 and 4 10 lemma 4 12 for 0 t 1 and k n 1 r t n t t k 1 k 2 proof by theorem 1 1 we know that t t t t t it follows that the same is true for any iterate of t t that is t n t t t t for all n 1 also let us recall that the spectral mapping theorem holds for t 14 42 43 we claim that r t k r t k for using 4 4 we have t t k t t k 1 t k 1 1 t 2 td 1 t k 1 d k 1 k 11 2 d 1 k 1 d k d 1 d t t since k 1 k 11 2 d 1 k 1 d k d 2 2 1 2 d 2 k 2 k 2 it follows that r t k r t k therefore r t k r n t t k r n t t k by the above mentioned spectral mapping property applied to n t t n t t k 2 it follows that r t n t t k 1 k 2 as desired remark 4 13 corollary 4 11 and lemma 4 12 provide a proof of theorem 1 7 lemma 4 14 for 0 t 1 and k 1 t t n k 2 n 1 is a decreasing sequence if we let lt k denote its limit then r t k lt k proof this is a straightforward consequence of corollary 4 11 and lemma 4 12 lemma 4 15 for 0 t 1 2 and k 1 we have t t k 2 t k 1 t 2 t k 1 1 t 2 t 1 2 t 2 proof with the notation used in the proof of lemma 4 8 we have t t k 2 atxa

of operators on hilbert space and assume that r t 0 then for 0 t 1 and k 1 we have lt k l k t 1 proof we will split the proof into two cases and use induction on k case 1 0 t 1 2 for k 1 we use lemma 4 14 assume now that lt k l k t 1 for all integers k m we will establish the identity for k m 1 by lemma 4 15 with t replaced by n t t we have n 1 t t m 2 n t t m 1 t 2 n t t m 1 1 t 2 n t t 1 2 t 2 4 8 n t t m t 2 n t t t 2 n t t m 1 1 t 2 n t t 1 2 t 2 by lemma 4 6 n t t m t 2 n t t m 1 1 t 2 n t t 1 t 2 4 9 we now take the limit as n in 4 8 and 4 9 to obtain lt m ltt m 1 l 1 tt m 1 l 1 2 tt 1 ltt ml 1 tt m 1 l 1 tt 1 in view of the inductive hypothesis and letting l lt 1 we can write lm ltt m 1 l m 1 1 t l 1 2 t lmtl m 1 1 t l 1 t equivalently lm ltt m 1 lm t m 1 lm it follows that ltt m 1 l m t m 1 lm by lemma 4 14 l r t 0 so we obtain lt m 1 l m 1 as desired 20 case 2 1 2 t 1 here n 1 t t m 2 n t t m 1 1 t 2 n t t m 1 t 2 n t t 2 t 1 2 4 10 n t t m 1 t 2 n t t 1 t 2 n t t m 1 t 2 n t t 2 t 1 2 by lemma 4 6 n t t m 1 t 2 n t t m 1 t 2 n t t t 2 4 11 as above we then take the limit as n in 4 10 and 4 11 to obtain lt m l 1 tt m 1 ltt m 1 l 2 t 1 t 1 l 1 tt mltt m 1 ltt 1 in view of the inductive hypothesis we then have lm l 1 tt m 1 l m 1 tl 2 t 1 lm 1 t l m 1 tlt equivalently lm l 1 tt m 1 l m 1 t 1 lm it follows that ltt m 1 l m m 1 t 1 lm by lemma 4 14 l r t 0 so we obtain lt m 1 l m 1 as desired we are now ready to put all the pieces together proof of theorem 4 5 we first consider the case when r t 0 by corollary 4 11 and lemma 4 17 for each k 1 the sequence n t t k 1 k n 1 is decreasing to l lt 1 moreover l r t we claim that l r t suppose that l r t fix n 0 1 and consider the sequence n 0 t t k 1 k 2 k 1 by lemmas 4 14 and 4 17 this sequence is bounded from below by l it follows that lim infk n 0 t t k 1 k 2 l but we know that this limit is the spectral radius r n t t so r t l r t a contradiction next we look at the case when r t 0 on the orthogonal direct sum h h let s t ci 0 0 where c 0 clearly t s t t c 0 0 c 0 0 so r s c 0 moreover n t s n t t ci 0 0 it follows that n t t 2 n t s 2 and therefore lim sup n t t 2 lim sup n t s 2 r s c since c can be taken arbitrarily small we conclude that lim n t t 2 0 r t as desired remark 4 18 theorem 1 6 is the d 1 instance of theorem 4 5 similarly theorem 1 5 follows from lemma 4 14 when d k 1 21 references 1 a
