adams bucknell edu nathan a wagner department of mathematics and statistics washington university in st louis nathanawagner wustl edu august 29 2019 abstract in this work we consider finite bandwidth reproducing kernel hilbert spaces which have orthonormal bases of the form fn z z n j j 1 1 anwjz where w 1 w 2 wj are distinct points on the circle t and an is a sequence of complex numbers with limit 1 we provide general conditions based on a matrix recursion that guarantee such spaces contain a functional multiple of the hardy space then we apply this general method to obtain strong results for finite bandwidth spaces when limn n 1 an p in particular we show that point evaluation can be extended boundedly to precisely j additional points on t and we obtain an explicit functional decomposition of these spaces for p 1 2 in analogy with a previous result in the tridiagonal case due to adams and mcguire we also prove that multiplication by z is a bounded operator on these spaces and that they contain the polynomials 1 the problem if k z w is a function defined on an open disc about the origin which is analytic in z and coanalytic in w then k has a power series representation k z w j 0 k 0 aj kz jwk in the case that a aj k is a bounded matrix it is an easy exercise to check that a is positive semi definite on 2 if and only if the function k is and in this case by the moore aronszajn theorem the function k is the kernel for a reproducing kernel hilbert 1 http arxiv org abs 1908 10822 v 1 space h k see 4 in this case the space h k consists of analytic functions on a domain containing a disk about the origin in c recall the well known fact that if fn is an orthonormal basis for the reproducing kernel hilbert space rkhs of functions h k associated with k then k z w n 0 fn z fn w 7 conversely if a can be factored as a ll where l has no kernel then the columns of l give the taylor coefficients of an orthonormal basis for h k 1 in fact h k can be identified with the range space of l in a very natural way 1 this range space identification will lie at the heart of most of our computations the cholesky algorithm always allows for a factorization of a positive definite matrix a ll with l lower triangular if a has finite bandwidth 2 j 1 then l is lower triangular with j 1 non trivial diagonals and we speak of a bandwidth 2 j 1 kernel k in particular we say an analytic kernel k is of finite bandwidth 2 j 1 if there exists an orthonormal basis of polynomials for h k of the form fn z b 0 n b 1 nz bj nz j zn the simplest case where the space h k has bandwidth 1 was extensively studied by shields in 8 in the context of multiplication operators such spaces are referred to as diagonal spaces and have orthonormal bases consisting of monomials in the context of bandwidth 2 j 1 analytic kernels the natural domain of h k is given by dom k z c n 0 fn z 2 adams and mcguire established that the natural domain for h k is a disk about the origin with up to j additional points 2 they explored the j 1 case and gave an interesting family of kernels k where h k is a nontrivial extension of a diagonal space 3 in this paper we show how to generalize their results to higher bandwidths now we can state the problem of interest throughout this work z 1 z 2 zj will be distinct points on the unit circle t and w 1 w 2 wj will be the corresponding conjugates the sequence of complex numbers a 0 a 1 will be a sequence converging to 1 so that 1 aj is nonvanishing define z j j 1 1 wjz j k 0 kz k and fn z z n anz we will follow the notational convention that j 0 if j 0 or j j then k z w n 0 fn z fn w is a bandwidth 2 j 1 kernel for a rkhs h k with orthonormal basis f 0 f 1 theorems 7 and 12 show that in the case where limn n 1 an p and p 1 2 h k has natural domain d d z 1 z 2 zj and decomposes as h k z h 2 d ck z z 1 ck z z 2 ck z zj moreover in this case multiplication by z is a bounded operator and the polynomials are contained in h k 2 these results generalize those in 3 and 9 to higher bandwidth and more general weight sequences this leads to a very nice functional characterization of certain finite bandwidth spaces the primary innovation in this work is the use of matrix recursion to bound the norm of infinite dimensional matrices a program which was started in 9 key also is the role played by the combinatorial theorems 15 and 16 2 preliminaries the first result shows that the restrictions of the functions in h k to the disc d are in the hardy space proposition 1 h k h 2 d proof if f h k then there exists an 2 sequence n such that f n 0 nfn thus f z n 0 nfn z n 0 n j k 0 ka k nz n k n 0 j k 0 n k ka k n k zn n 0 nz n by the cauchy schwarz inequality n 2 c 2 j k 0 n k 2 where c is a constant that depends only on the zeros z 1 z 2 zj and the sequence an thus n 0 n 2 j 1 c 2 n 0 n 2 and f is in h 2 d given the basis fn z anz z n and the fact that an 1 it is reasonable to ask when functions of the form z f z for f h 2 d are in h k the rate of convergence of an to 1 is crucial in assessing when this is the case douglas range inclusion lemma see 6 will provide the major tool to answer this question to this end let l be the matrix whose nth column consists of the taylor coefficients of fn z and let l be the matrix whose nth column consists of the taylor coefficients of zn z by douglas lemma z h 2 d h k if and only if there is a bounded matrix c cj k j k 0 such that l lc solving this equation for c is complicated and will involve a recursion first note that l and l are both lower triangular which implies 3 that c is as well so one must solve 0 0 0 1 0 0 2 1 0 j j 1 j 2 0 j j 1 0 0 j 0 0 0 1 a 0 0 0 2 a 2 0 1 a 1 0 ja j 0 j 1 a j 1 1 j 2 a j 2 2 0 ja j 1 j 1 a j 1 2 0 0 ja j 2 c 0 0 0 0 c 1 0 c 1 1 0 c 2 0 c 2

ia i n k icn k i n if 1 k j cn k n j i 1 ia i n k icn k i n if k j this recursion is profitably viewed as a vector recursion for n 0 and j n j let vj n cj j 1 n cj j 2 n cj n t the j by j matrix mn 0

expressed by the recursion vn k n mn k vn k 1 n for k j tracing the recursion backwards one obtains vn k n mn kmn k 1 mn j 1 vn j n for k j the recursion matrix mn and its pointwise limit m 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 j j 1 j 2 2 1 4 will play dominant roles in what follows note that j zj 1 j z j 2 j zj 1 t is an eigenvector for m with eigenvalue wj for j 1 j it is well known that j j 1 2 j forms a basis for cj and it turns out that in the proceeding section it will be useful to describe the action of mn in terms of a basis of these eigenvectors to determine when c is bounded we will estimate the norms of such matrix products for large k the following result due to adams and mcguire in 3 will then provide the desired condition theorem 2 adams mcguire if p 0 then the matrix m 0 0 0 0 p 2 0 0 0 p 2 2 3 p p 3 0 0 p 2 2 4 p p 3 3 4 p p 3 0 p 2 2 5 p p 3 3 5 p p 4 4 5 p p 5 is bounded if and only if p 1 2 the following result gives sufficient conditions on the decay of the norms of products of the matrices mn and the norms of the starting vectors in order for the containment z h 2 d h k to hold theorem 3 if mn is the recursion matrix defined above and for some p 1 2 z n j and d 1 0 we have the estimate mn 1 mn 2 mn 1 p n for all n n and vn j n d 1 p n j for all n then z h 2 d h k proof first notice that it suffices to prove that the matrix c defined above is the matrix of a bounded operator on 2 let d 2 supn mn note it is clear that d 2 as the entries in mn are uniformly bounded in n given n k z with k n j letm be the largest integer such that k m n j then m 0 and from the recursion cn k n vn k n mn kmn k 1 mn k m 1 vn k m n mn kmn k 1 mn k m 1 vn k m n m j 1 1 p n k 1 j vn k m n 5 for 0 1 log 1 without loss of generality we may assume n p which affords log m j 1 1 p n k 1 j m j 1 p n k 1 j m 1 j 0 p n n j 1 j 1 m 0 p n x dx p log n x m 0 log n n m p where n n n j 1 therefore cn k n n n m p vn k m n n n m p mn k m mn k m 1 n mn j 1 vn j n n n m p d n 2 vn j n d n 2 d 1 p n j n n m p recalling that the schur or hadamard product of a bounded matrix with another matrix with entries bounded away from 0 and is bounded see lemma 2 1 in 3 a simple application of the preceding theorem demonstrates that c is bounded 3 finite bandwidth reproducing kernels in this section we obtain an explicit decomposition for these spaces in analogy with 3 in the case p 1 2 and limn n 1 an p in doing so we substantially extend their results to arbitrary bandwidths and more general weight sequences the following two lemmas have routine proofs and are needed for the purposes of computation lemma 4 if a 1 a 2 ak are n n matrices with complex entries bounded in modulus by c then a 1 ak n kck lemma 5 if z 1 z 2 zj are points on the unit circle t then 1 1 1 c j is a limit point of the set z 1 z 2 z j z 6 proof repeatedly apply the compactness of t we now proceed to the statement and proof of the main lemma lemma 6 let mn denote the recursion matrix defined above an a non vanishing sequence satisfying limn n 1 an p where p 1 2 and x the change of basis matrix whose jth column is the eigenvector j of the limiting matrix m if m n x 1 mnx then for all 0 there exist positive integers and n such that for all n n m n 1 m n 1 p n proof let be a large positive integer to be chosen later and fix k with 0 k 1 we will choose n later based on an appropriate choice of linearize mn k by writing mn k m p n b rn k where b is the j by j matrix whose first j 1 rows are zero and whose last row is j j j 1 j 1 j 2 j 2 2 2 1 and rn k is the j by j matrix whose first j 1 rows are zero and whose jth row is 1 ajn j k 1 pj n j 1 a 2 n 1 k 2 p n 2 1 an k p n 1 since rn k can be bounded entrywise by e n n where e n is some function satisfying limn e n 0 it follows by lemma 4 that rn k je n n we compute m n 1 m n x 1 1 k 0 m pb n rn k x x 1 m 1 k 0 mk pb n m 1 k r x where r is the sum of all products in the expansion involving the matrices rn k there are 3 1 such terms thus x 1 rx c 1 e n n where c 1 is a constant that depends only on j and the crucial norm estimate will come from x 1 m 1 k 0 mk b n m 1 k x so we turn to a computation of this norm a straightforward gaussian elimination shows that the vector 0 0 0 0 1 can be expressed in terms of the eigenvectors for m as j j 1 wj zj j to compute the norm of x 1 m 1 k 0 m k b n m 1 k x consider the action of 1 k 0 m k b n m 1 k on h for h 1 2 j note that z 1 j k 1 kz k j j 1 1 wjz and notice that zh wh j j 6 h 1 wjzh j k 1 k kz k 1 h 7 now zj is on the unit circle so 1 wjzh wj zj zh thus zh j j 1 wj j j 6 h zj zh therefore b h zh 0 zh j j 1 wj zj j wh h j j 6 h wj zh zj j thus 1 k 0 mk pb n m 1 k h 1 k 0 w 1 k h mk pb n h p n w 1 h 1 k 0 w k h mk wh h j j 6 h wj zh zj j p n w 1 h 1 k 0 w k h wk 1 h h j j 6 h wk 1 j zh zj j p n w h h j j 6 h p n wj w 1 h 1 wj wh 1 wj wh zh zj j by lemma 5 for each 0 there is a n such that each of the modulus of each of coefficients of vj for j 6 h above is less than 2 jn since m h w h vh it follows that the norm of x 1 m 1 k 0 m k b n m 1 k x is bounded above by the norm of the matrix p 1 p n 2 jn 2 jn 2 jn 2 jn 2 jn 1 p n 2 jn 2 jn 2 jn 2 jn 2 jn 1 p n 2 jn 2 jn 2 jn 2 jn 2 jn 1 p n 2 jn 2 jn 2 jn 2 jn 2 jn 1 p n but from the triangle inequality we have the estimate p 1 p n 2 n 8 putting all of our calculations together and choosing n large enough so that for n n e n 2 c 1 we deduce that for all n n m n 1 m n 1 p n 2 n 2 n 1 p n now we are ready to prove the containment result theorem 7 if h k denotes the reproducing kernel hilbert space with orthonormal basis fn z anz z n satisfying p 1 2 and limn n 1 an p then z h 2 d h k proof this is a simple application of theorem 3 and lemma 6 first choose 0 sufficiently small so that p 1 2 by lemma 6 there exist positive integers and n such that for all n n m n 1 m n 1 p n 1 p n where p p 1 2 note mn 1 mn 2 mn xm n 1 m n 2 m nx 1 m n km n k 1 m n k m 1 x x 1 x x 1 1 p n the extra constant is harmless in regards to the proof of theorem 3 it only remains to check the growth rate on the starting vectors vn j n using our previous notation we claim that for each 1 j j there exists a bounded sequence of complex numbers n j n such that for all n n cn j n 1 an n j note that this implies there exists a positive real constant m such that vn j n m 1 an which in turn implies the starting vectors satisfy the growth rate of theorem 3 we prove the claim by induction on j for the base case note that cn 1 n 1 an 1 cn n 1 1 an then notice that cn j n j 1 a j n j 1 i 1 ia i n j icn j i n j 1 an a 2 n a j 1 n 1 an j 1 i 1 ia i n j i 1 an n j i by induction the claim holds as the hypotheses of theorem 3 are evidently satisfied the containment follows 9 example 8 this example shows that if an 1 more rapidly then an 1 p n then the containment of the previous result does not occur specifically if j 2 z 1 1 z 2 1 and an 1 1 n 2 2 then 1 z 1 z h 2 d h k if and only if there is a bounded matrix c satisfying l lc where 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 9 16 0 1 0 64 81 0 0 0 225 256 c 0 0 0 0 c 1 0 c 1 1 0 c 2 0 c 2 1 c 2 2 c 3 0 c 3 1 c 3 2 c 4 0 c 4 1 c 4 2 c 5 0 c 5 1 c 5 2 the entries of c are completely determined by this equation and it is straightforward to show that lim cn 0 6 0 and thus that c is not bounded the same argument works for an 1 1 n 2 p with p 1 before tackling the second half of the decomposition a few different results will be required first to ensure this decomposition actually makes sense we need to establish that the natural domain of h k which we denote by d of h k consists of the unit disc d plus the j extra points on the boundary z 1 z 2 zj proposition 9 if d denotes the natural domain of the space h k then d d z 1 z 2 zj proof it suffices to verify that for 1 j j we have n 0 fn zj 2 but this is clear as n 0 fn zj 2 n 0 1 an 2 which is comparable to n 0 p 2 n 2 next we proceed to state two technical propositions that we will need in the forth coming proof the proofs are postponed to the next section the second theorem relies on results from the theory of symmetrical polynomials proposition 10 the matrix a defined by a k z 1 z 1 k z 2 z 1 k zj z 1 k z 1 z 2 k z 2 z 2 k zj z 2 k z 1 zj k z 2 zj k zj zj is invertible 10 proposition 11 for j 1 2 j define j k 6 j wj wk if qn x j j 1 wjj j x wj w n j then q 0 x q 1 x satisfy the recursion n i 0 iqn i x n 1 x n 1 1 theorem 12 for every f h k there exists a g h 2 d and constants b 1 b 2 bj c such that f z z g z b 1 k z z 1 bjk z zj proof given f h k first choose b 1 b 2 bj so that f z b 1 k z z 1 b 2 k z z 2 bjk z zj vanishes at z z 1 zj note this is always possible in light of proposition 10 thus assume without loss of generality that f h k satisfies f z 1 f z 2 f zj 0 for j 1 2 j our goal now becomes to demonstrate the existence of a g h 2 d so f g as f h k there exists n 2 such that f z n 0 nfn z we shall refer to such a sequence n as permissable we will produce a sequence gn 2 such that f z z n 0 gnz n expanding both expressions for f and equating gives n 0 j k 0 na k n kz kzn n 0 j k 0 gn kz kzn equating like powers of z above leads to the equation j k 0 n k ka k n k gn k k 0 for n 0 1 2 11 where any quantities with negative subscripts are treated as zero since 0 1 this relationship can be expressed as the recursion gn n n 1 j n j j n ja n j j gj n j recursion shows that one may express gj as a linear combination gn n k 0 cn k k for some constants cn k applying and equating like coefficients leads to cn n 1 cn k n ka n k k n k i 1 icn i k n j k n 1 and for 0 k n j 1 cn k j i 1 icn i k this suggests that one let pn n z be the sequence of polynomials defined by the linear recursion p 0 x 1 p 1 x 1 1 x pn x nx n n i 1 ipn i x pj x jx j j i 1 ipj i x and thereafter if n j 1 pn x j i 1 ipn i x then cn k k pn ak if n 0 12 to prove this claim notice that it follows directly for all k 0 if n 0 1 j using induction the cases n j then follow from the recursion by induction thus the map n 7 gn is encoded by the following matrix bp that is gn n 0 bp n n 0 where bp 1 0 0 0 0 0 p 1 a 0 1 0 0 0 0 p 2 a 0 p 1 a 1 1 0 0 0 p 3 a 0 p 2 a 1 p 1 a 2 1 0 0 p 4 a 0 p 3 a 1 p 2 a 2 p 1 a 3 1 0 if the matrix bp were bounded as an operator then the desired result would follow immediately however the columns of bp are not in 2 we will use the assumption that f zj 0 for j 1 2 j to find an equivalent encoding of the map n 7 gn which is bounded to find this alternate encoding of bp begin by considering the vector vn pn a 0 pn 1 a 1 p 2 an 2 p 1 an 1 1 0 which equals the n th row of bp let zj be a root of the fact that f zj 0 is equivalent to the equation n 0 n anzj z n j 0 which in turn means that the vector wj a 0 zj a 1 zj zj a 2 zj z 2 j a 3 zj z 3 j for j 1 2 j is orthogonal to any permissible n n 0 let qj n x xzj z n j for n z then the polynomial sequence qj n n z satisfies condition satisfied by pn n z this follows directly from the fact that zj is a root of moreover the vector uj qj n a 0 qj n 1 a 1 qj 1 an 1 qj 0 an qj 1 an 1 equals wnj wj and thus is orthogonal to all permissible sequences therefore the nth row vn of bp can be replaced by vn less any linear combination of the vectors u 1 u 2 uj without changing the action on permissible vectors proposition 11 shows that subtracting v n qn 1 a 0 qn 2 a 1 qn 3 a 2 from vn zeroes out the first n entries thus an equivalent encoding of bp is given by the matrix c 1 q 1 a 0 q 2 a 1 q 3 a 2 q 4 a 3 0 1 q 1 a 1 q 2 a 2 q 3 a 3 0 0 1 q 1 a 2 q 2 a 3 0 0 0 1 q 1 a 3 13 since w 1 w 2 wj are discrete points on the unit circle it is a straightforward exercise to show that there exists a constant c independent of m and n such that qn am c 1 am thus the map j 7 gj is bounded if the matrix c is bounded where c 1 a 0 1 a 1 1 a 2 0 1 a 1 1 a 2 0 0 1 a 3 but this matrix is known to be bounded since the entries behave asymptotically like p n see theorem 2 2 in 3 establishing the result remark note that the preceding result is independent of p it holds for all p 0 compare this to theorem 7 remark note that the proof of the preceding theorem demonstrates that if we had taken ajs with a slower convergence rate we would not have obtained a bounded matrix for c in particular suppose that aj 1 1 j 2 p where p 1 2 then we would obtain c 1 2 p 1 3 p 1 4 p 0 1 3 p 1 4 p 0 0 1 4 p this matrix is easily seen to be unbounded in particular the 2 norms of its columns approach which suggests but does not prove that we might not obtain the result of the theorem in this case together with example 8 this helps justify the consideration of spaces with the specific growth rate given in the hypothesis of the theorem theorem 12 admits the following corollary completing our characterization of these spaces when p 1 2 and limn n 1 an p corollary 13 if p 1 2 and limn n 1 an p then h k z h 2 d ck z z 1 ck z z 2 ck z zj 4 proof of combinatorial propositions lemma 14 if fn z anz z n j is the nth basis vector for h k then for some n the matrix bn fn z 1 fn z 2 fn zj fn 1 z 1 fn 1 z 2 fn 1 zj fn j 1 z 1 fn j 1 z 2 fn j 1 zj is invertible 14 proof define j z k 6 j 1 wkz and notice that fn zj j anzj z n j 1 an notice that bn can be written as the product bn d 1 cnd 2 where d 1 is the diagonal matrix with entries 1 an 1 an 1 1 an j 1 and d 2 is the diagonal matrix with entries zn 11 z n 1 2 z n 1 j thus cn j an izj z i 1 j j i j 1 notice that the component wise limit of cn as n is c j zj z i 1 j j i j 1 which is the matrix product of the vandermonde matrix v zi 1 j j i j 1 with the diagonal matrix d 3 with entries 1 z 1 2 z 2 j zj since these matrices are invertible so too is c since the invertible matrices form an open set set in c j 2 cn must be invertible for some n proof of proposition 10 suppose that a v 0 for some v cj then 0 a v v j k 1 vkk z zk 2 but this implies that j k 1 vkk z zk 0 use the preceding lemma to find j elements g 1 g 2 gj of h k with the property that gj zk 0 if k 6 j and gj zj 1 thus v j j k 1 gj z vkk z zk gj z j k 1 vkk z zk gj z 0 0 in other words a has trivial kernel so must be invertible the following two theorems from combinatorics provide the necessary tools to prove proposition 11 theorem 15 appears in 5 while theorem 16 is a well known result in combinatorics theorem 15 see 5 theorem 2 2 for each integer m 0 j j 1 xmj j hm j 1 x 1 x 2 xj where hk is the k th homogeneous symmetric polynomial which is defined to be zero for k 0 theorem 16 for each integer m 0 m i 0 ihm i x 1 x 2 xj 0 15 theorem 16 is a well known result in the field of symmetric polynomials and we omit its proof now we are in a position to prove proposition 11 proof of proposition 11 first assume 0 n j and write n i 0 iqn i x j k 0 akx k then n i 0 iqn i x n i 0 i j j 1 wjj j x wj w n i j n i 0 i j j 1 j k 0 wjj j k x wj k wn ij j k 0 kx k n i 0 i j j 1 wj n i kj j j k 0 kx k n i 0 ihn k i 1 w 1 wj thus a 0 0 n i 0 ihn i 1 w 1 wj now 0 1 and from theorem 2 n 1 i 0 ihn i 1 w 1 wj 0 thus a 0 n 1 now suppose 1 k n then ak k n i 0 ihn k i 1 w 1 wj k n k 1 i 0 ihn k i 1 w 1 wj 0 for k n 1 an 1 n 1 n i 0 ih i w 1 wj n 1 16 since only the first term in the sum is non zero if n 1 k j then n k i 1 is always negative for i 0 so ak k n i 0 ihn 1 k i w 1 wj 0 this shows that recursion holds for 0 n j now suppose n j then n i 0 iqn i x j k 0 kx k n i 0 ihn k i 1 x 1 xj since n j and j 0 for j j theorem 2 applies to show that the sum n i 0 iqn i x equals zero 5 some additional consequences consider next the natural question of whether h k is closed under multiplication by the independent variable z we have the following result theorem 17 if p 1 2 and limn n 1 an p then z is a multiplier on h k proof it is sufficient to show that the matrix representation of mz with respect to the orthonormal basis fn n n is bounded as a matrix denote this matrix as c ck n thus mz fn k 0 ck nfk with the coefficients ck n yet to be determined expanding the sum and rearranging as powers of z shows that ck n 0 for k n and leads to the recursion cn 1 n 1 cn j 1 n ja j n j i 1 ia i n j 1 icn j 1 i n if 0 j j cn j k 1 n j i 1 ia i n j k 1 icn j k 1 i n if 1 k notice that for k 1 this is precisely the same recursion encoded by mn and theorem 7 applies to demonstrate the boundedness of c as before it is straightforward to show the starting vectors have the appropriate decay and we omit the details just note that the diagonal of 1 s can be removed without affecting the boundedness of c 17 thus in addition to establishing that the multiplier algebra of h k contains the polynomials we get the following nice result corollary 18 let h k denote the reproducing kernel hilbert space with orthonormal basis fn z anz z n if p 1 2 and limn n 1 an p then h k contains the polynomials proof in light of theorem 17 it suffices to show that 1 h k write 1 n 0 cnfn z n 0 j j 0 cn ja j nz j n it is enough to show cn 2 equating like powers of z leads to the recursion with starting value c 0 1 and thereafter cj j i 1 cj i ia i j i if j 1 where we recall that i 0 if i j once again the vectors vn cn j 1 cn j 2 cn t satisfy the recursion vn 1 mn 1 vn for n j j 1 and the result follows as be fore much future work could be done in this area for instance one could try to obtain a full characterization of the multiplier algebras of these
