school of mathematical and statistical sciences the university of texas rio grande valley edinburg texas 78539 abstract we introduce two natural notions of multivariable aluthge transforms toral and spherical and study their basic properties in the case of 2 variable weighted shifts we first prove that the toral aluthge transform does not pre serve joint hyponormality in sharp contrast with the 1 variable case second we identify a large class of 2 variable weighted shifts for which hyponormality is preserved under both transforms third we consider whether these aluthge transforms are norm continuous fourth we study how the taylor and taylor essential spectra of 2 variable weighted shifts behave under the toral and spher ical aluthge transforms as a special case we consider the aluthge transforms of the drury arveson 2 shift finally we briefly discuss the class of spheri cally quasinormal 2 variable weighted shifts which are the fixed points for the spherical aluthge transform

the aluthge transform for bounded operators on hilbert space has attracted considerable attention in this note we set out to extend the aluthge transform to commuting n tuples of bounded operators we identify two natural notions toral and spherical and study their basic properties we then focus on 2 variable weighted shifts for which much can be said let h be a complex hilbert space and let b h denote the algebra of bounded linear operators on h for t b h the polar decomposition of t is t v t where v is a partial isometry with ker v kert and t t t the aluthge transform of t is the operator t t 12 v t 12 1 this trans form was first considered by a aluthge in an effort to study p hyponormal and log hyponormal operators roughly speaking the idea behind the aluthge transform is to convert an operator into another operator which shares with the first one many spectral properties but which is closer to being a normal operator in recent years the aluthge transform has received substantial attention i b jung e ko and c pearcy proved in 40 that t has a nontrivial invariant subspace if and only if t does since every normal operator has nontrivial invariant subspaces the aluthge transform has a natural connection with the 2 invariant subspace problem in 41 i b jung e ko and c pearcy also proved that t and t have the same spectrum moreover in 43 resp 44 m k kim and e ko resp f kimura proved that t has property if and only if t has property finally t ando proved in 2 that t 1 t 1 t for additional results see 9 and 50 for a unilateral weighted shift w shift 0 1 the aluthge trans form w is also a unilateral weighted shift given by w shift 0 1 1 2 see 45 1 1 it is easy to see that w is hyponormal if and only if 0 1 thus by 1 1 if w is hyponormal then the aluthge transform w of w is also hyponormal however the converse is not true in general for example if w shift 1 2 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 then w is clearly not hyponormal but the aluthge transform w u is subnormal here and in what follows u denotes the unweighted unilateral shift in 45 s h lee w y lee and the second named author showed that for k 2 the aluthge transform when acting on weighted shifts need not preserve k hyponormality finally g exner proved in 34 that the aluthge transform of a subnormal weighted shift need not be subnormal in this article we introduce two aluthge transforms of commuting pairs of hilbert space operators with special emphasis on 2 variable weighted shifts w t 1 t 2 since a priori there are several possible notions we discuss two plausible definitions and their basic properties in sections 3 and 4 our research will allow us to compare both definitions in terms of how well they generalize the 1 variable notion after discussing some basic properties of each aluthge transform we proceed to study both transforms in the case of 2 variable weighted shifts we consider topics such as preservation of joint hyponormality norm continuity and taylor spectral behavior for i 1 2 we consider the polar decomposition ti vi ti and we let t i ti 1 2 vi ti 1 2 i 1 2 1 2 denote the classical 1 variable aluthge transform the toral aluthge trans form of the pair t 1 t 2 is t 1 t 2 t 1 t 2 for a 2 variable weighted shift w t 1 t 2 we denote the toral aluthge transform of w by w as we will see in proposition 3 2 the commutativity of w does not automatically follow from the commutativity of w in fact the necessary and sufficient condition to preserve commutativity is k 1 k 2 1 k 1 1 k 2 1 k 1 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 2 for all k 1 k 2 0 1 3 under this assumption and in sharp contrast with the 1 variable situation it is possible to exhibit a commuting subnormal pair w such that w is commuting and not hyponormal as a matter of fact in theorem 3 11 we con struct a class of subnormal 2 variable weighted shifts w whose cores are of 3 tensor form and for which the hyponormality of w can be described entirely by two parameters as a result we obtain a rather large class of subnormal 2 variable weighted shifts with non hyponormal toral aluthge transforms there is a second plausible definition of aluthge transform which uses a joint polar decomposition assume that we have a decomposition of the form t 1 t 2 v 1 p v 2 p where p t 1 t 1 t 2 t 2 now let t 1 t 2 pv 1 p pv 2 p 1 4 we refer to t as the spherical aluthge transform of t even though t 1 pv 1 p is not the aluthge transform of t 1 we observe in section 4 that q v 1 v 1 v 2 v 2 is a joint partial isometry for pq 2 p p 2 from which it follows that q is isometric on the range of p we will prove in section 4 that this particular definition of the aluthge transform preserves commutativity there is another useful aspect of the spherical aluthge transform which we now mention if we consider the fixed points of this transform acting on 2 variable weighted shifts then we obtain an appropriate generalization of the concept of quasinormality recall that a hilbert space operator t is said to be quasinormal if t commutes with the positive factor p in the polar decomposition t v p equivalently if v commutes with p it follows easily that t is quasinormal if and only if t t that is if and only if t is a fixed point for the aluthge transform in section 10 we prove that if a 2 variable weighted shift w t 1 t 2 satisfies w t 1 t 2 then t 1 t 1 t 2 t 2 is up to scalar multiple a spherical isometry it follows that we can then study some properties of the spherical aluthge transform using well known results about spherical isometries in this paper we also focus on the following three basic problems problem 1 1 let k 1 and assume that w is k hyponormal does it follow that the toral aluthge transform w is k hyponormal what about the case of the spherical aluthge transform w problem 1 2 is the toral aluthge transform s t s t continuous in the uniform topology similarly does continuity hold for the spherical aluthge transform w problem 1 3 does the taylor spectrum resp taylor essential spectrum of w equal to that of w what about the case of the spherical aluthge transform w 2 notation and preliminaries 2 1 subnormality and k hyponormality we say that t b h is normal if t t tt quasinormal if t commutes with t t subnormal if t n h where n is normal and n h h and 4 hyponormal if t t tt for s t b h let s t st ts we say that an n tuple t t 1 tn of operators on h is jointly hyponormal if the operator matrix t t t 1 t 1 t 2 t 1 t n t 1 t 1 t 2 t 2 t 2 t n t 2 t 1 tn t 2 tn t n tn is positive on the direct sum of n copies of h cf 4 24 for instance if n 2 t t t 1 t 1 t 2 t 1 t 1 t 2 t 2 t 2 for k 1 t is k hyponormal if i t t k is jointly hyponormal the bram halmos characterization of subnormality 10 iii 1 9 can be paraphrased as follows t is subnormal if and only if t is k hyponormal for every k 1 24 proposition 1 9 the n tuple t t 1 t 2 tn is said to be normal if t is commuting and each ti is normal and t is subnormal if t is the restriction of a normal n tuple to a common invariant subspace in particular a commuting pair t t 1 t 2 is said to be k hyponormal k 1 17 if t k t 1 t 2 t 2 1 t 2 t 1 t 2 2 t k 1 t 2 t k 11 t k 2 is hyponormal or equivalently t k t k t q 2 t p 1 tm 2 t n 1 1 n m k 1 p q k 0 clearly for t b h we have normal quasinormal subnormal k hyponormal hyponormal as one might expect there is a version of the bram halmos theorem in several variables proved in 17 a commuting pair which is k hyponormal for every k 1 is necessarily subnormal 2 2 unilateral weighted shifts for n n 0 a bounded sequence of positive real numbers called weights let w 2 z 2 z be the associated unilateral weighted shift defined by w en nen 1 all n 0 where en n 0 is the canonical or thonormal basis in 2 z we will often write shift 0 1 to denote the weighted shift w with a weight sequence n n 0 as usual the unweighted unilateral shift will be denoted by u shift 1 1 the moments of w are given by k k w 1 if k 0 20 2 1 2 k 1 if k 0 5 2 3 2 variable weighted shifts similarly consider double indexed positive bounded sequences k k z 2 k k 1 k 2 z 2 z z and let 2 z 2 be the hilbert space of square summable complex sequences indexed by z 2 we define the 2 variable weighted shift w t 1 t 2 by t 1 ek kek 1 and t 2 ek kek 2 where 1 1 0 and 2 0 1 see figure 1 i clearly t 1 t 2 t 2 t 1 k 2 k k 1 k all k z 2 2 1 in an entirely similar way one can define multivariable weighted shifts triv ially a pair of unilateral weighted shifts w and w gives rise to a 2 variable weighted shift w t t 1 t 2 if we let k 1 k 2 k 1 and k 1 k 2 k 2 all k 1 k 2 z in this case w is subnormal resp hyponormal if and only if t 1 and t 2 are as well in fact under the canonical identification of 2 z 2 with 2 z 2 z we have t 1 i w and t 2 w i and w is also doubly commuting for this reason we do not focus attention on shifts of this type and use them only when the above mentioned triviality is desirable or needed 0 0 1 0 2 0 00 10 01 11 02 12 t 1 t 2 0 1 0 2 00 01 10 00

weight diagram of its toral aluthge transform w t 1 t 2 t 1 t 2 respectively observe that the commutativity of w requires 1 3 6 2 4 moments and subnormality given k z 2 the moments of w are k k w 1 if k 1 0 and k 2 0 2 0 0 2 k 1 1 0 if k 1 1 and k 2 0 2 0 0 2 0 k 2 1 if k 1 0 and k 2 1 2 0 0 2 k 1 1 0 2 k 1 0 2 k 1 k 2 1 if k 1 1 and k 2 1 we remark that due to the commutativity condition 2 1 k can be computed using any nondecreasing path from 0 0 to k 1 k 2 we now recall a well known characterization of subnormality for multivari able weighted shifts 39 due to c berger cf 10 iii 8 16 and independently established by gellar and wallen 36 in the 1 variable case w t 1 t 2 admits a commuting normal extension if and only if there is a probability mea sure which we call the berger measure ofw defined on the 2 dimensional rectangle r 0 a 1 0 a 2 where ai ti 2 such that k w r tkd s t r sk 1 tk 2 d s t for all k z 2 for i 1 we let li ek 1 k 1 i denote the invariant subspace obtained by removing the first i vectors in the canonical orthonormal basis of 2 z we also let l l 1 in the 1 variable case ifw is subnormal with berger measure then the berger measure ofw li is d li s s i i w d s wherew li means the restriction of w to li as above u is the unweighted unilateral shift and for 0 a 1 we let sa shift a 1 1 let p denote the point mass probability measure with support the singleton set p observe that u and sa are subnormal with berger measures 1 and 1 a 2 0 a 2 1 respectively 2 5 taylor spectra we conclude this section with some terminology needed to describe the taylor and taylor essential spectra of commuting n tuples of operators on a hilbert space let n e be the complex exterior algebra on n generators e 1 en with identity e 0 1 multiplication denoted by wedge product and complex coefficients subject to the collapsing property ei ej ej ei 0 1 i j 1 if one declares ei ei 1 eik i 1 n to be an or thonormal basis the exterior algebra becomes a hilbert space with the canonical inner product i e ei ej 0 if i 6 j ei ej 1 if i j it also admits an orthogonal decomposition ni 0 i with i k i k moreover dim k n k n k n k let ei denote the creation operator given by 7 ei i 1 n we recall that e i ej eje i ij and ei is a partial isometry all i j 1 n consider a hilbert space h and set 7 h ni 0 h c i for a commuting n tuple t t 1 tn of bounded operators on h define dt h h by dt x n i 1 tix ei then dt dt 0 so randt kerdt this naturally leads to a cochain complex called the koszul complex k t h associated to t on h as follows k t h 0 0 h 0 d 0 t h 1 d 1 t d n 1 t h n d n t 0 0 where di t denotes the restriction of dt to the subspace h i we define t to be invertible in case its associated koszul complex k t h is exact thus we can define the taylor spectrum t t of t as follows t t 1 n cn k t 1 1 tn n h is not invertible j l taylor showed that if h 6 0 then t t is a nonempty compact subset of the polydisc of multiradius r t r t 1 r tn where r ti is the spectral radius of ti i 1 n 47 48 for additional facts about this notion of joint spectrum the reader is referred to 11 12 and 15 3 the toral aluthge transform we will now gather several well known auxiliary results which are needed for the proofs of the main results of this section we begin with a criterion for the k hyponormality k 1 of 2 variable weighted shifts but first we need to describe concretely the toral aluthge transform of a 2 variable weighted shift and the necessary and sufficient condition to guarantee its commutativity lemma 3 1 let w t 1 t 2 be a 2 variable weighted shift then t 1 ek k k 1 ek 1 and t 2 ek k k 2 ek 2 for all k z 2 proof straightforward from 1 2 in the following result we prove that the commutativity of t 1 t 2 requires a condition on the weight sequences 8 3 1 commutativity of the toral aluthge transform proposition 3 2 let w be a commuting 2 variable weighted shift with weight diagram given by figure 1 i then w t 1 t 2 is commuting k 2 k 1 2 k 1 k 2 2 3 1 for all k z 2 proof let k z 2 by lemma 3 1 t 2 t 1 ek k k 1 k 1 k 1 2 ek 1 2 k k 1 k 1 k 1 2 ek 1 2 k k 2 k 1 k 1 2 ek 1 2 by 2 1 k k 1 k 2 k 2 2 ek 1 2 again by 2 1 k k 2 k 1 k 2 2 ek 1 2 3 2 on the other hand t 1 t 2 ek k k 2 k 2 k 1 2 ek 1 2 3 3 from 3 2 and 3 3 it follows that t 1 t 2 t 2 t 1 if and only if k 2 k 1 2 k 1 k 2 2 as desired remark 3 3 by proposition 3 2 and the commutativity condition for w it is straightforward to prove that 3 1 is equivalent to k 1 k 1 2 k 2 k 2 1 3 4 for all k z 2 lemma 3 4 17 let w be a commuting 2 variable weighted shift then the following are equivalent i w is k hyponormal ii mu k w u n m p q w 0 n m k 0 p q k 0 for all u z 2 we recall that mi resp nj is the subspace of 2 z 2 spanned by the canonical orthonormal basis associated to indices k k 1 k 2 with k 1 0 and k 2 i resp k 1 j and k 2 0 for simplicity we write m m 1 and n n 1 the core c w of w is the restriction of w to the invariant subspace m n a 2 variable weighted shift w is said to be of tensor form if it is of the form i w w i for suitable 1 variable weight sequences and we also let t c w c w is of tensor form 9 proposition 3 5 cf 42 let w t 1 t 2 be a commuting 2 variable weighted shift then for a b 0 and k 1 we have t 1 t 2 is k hyponormal at 1 bt 2 is k hyponormal 3 2 hyponormality is not preserved under the toral aluthge transform as we observed in the introduction the 1 variable aluthge transform leaves the class of hyponormal weighted shifts invariant in this subsection we will show that the same is not true of the toral aluthge transform acting on 2 variable weighted shifts to see this consider the commuting 2 variable weighted shift w given by figure 2 ii that is w has a symmetric weight diagram has a core of tensor form with berger measure and with zero th and first rows given by backward extensions of a weighted shift whose berger measure is we will denote those backward extensions by x 0 and a respectively also we denote by 0 1 the weight sequence as sociated with since we wish to characterize the subnormality of w we assume that x 0 and a are subnormal which requires that 1 s l 1 let 1 s d s we recall the following result from 26 0 0 i 1 0 2 0 3 0 x 0 x 1 x 2 1 2 a 0 1 2 a 0 x 1 0 1 2 a 0 x 1 0 1 2 t 1 t 2 0 1 0 2 0 3 y 0 y 1 y 2 1 a y 0 x 0 0 1 a y 0 0 x 0 x 1 0 1 0 0 ii 1 0 2 0 3 0 x 0 0 1 a 0 1 a 0

0 y 1 all follow from 3 1 weight diagram of the 2 variable weighted shift w t 1 t 2 in subsection 3 2 lemma 3 6 subnormal backward extension of a 1 variable weighted shift 26 proposition 1 5 let t be a weighted shift whose restriction tl to l e 1 e 2 is subnormal with associated measure l then t is subnormal with associated measure if and only if i 1 t l 1 l ii 20 1 t l 1 l 1 in this case d t 20 t d l t 1 20 1 t l 1 l d 0 t in particular t is never subnormal when l 0 0 thus by lemma 3 6 we must have x 20 1 and a 2 1 for the proof of lemma 3 9 we need to recall a few facts about 2 variable weighted shifts 10 lemma 3 7 cf 27 i let and be two positive measures on a set x we say that on x if e e for all borel subset e x equivalently if and only if fd fd for all f c x such that f 0 on x ii let be a probability measure on x y and assume that 1 t l 1 the extremal measure ext which is also a probability measure on x y is given by d ext s t 1 0 t 1 t 1 t l 1 d s t iii given a measure on x y the marginal measure x is given by x 1 x where x x y x is the canonical projection onto x thus x e e y for every e x lemma 3 8 26 proposition 3 10 subnormal backward extension of a 2 variable weighted shift assume that w is a commuting pair of hyponormal operators and that w m is subnormal with associated measure m then w is subnormal if and only if the following conditions hold i 1 t l 1 m ii 200 1 t l 1 m 1 iii 200 1 t l 1 m m x ext 0 moreover if 200 1 t l 1 m 1 then m x ext 0 in the case when w is subnormal the berger measure of w is given by d s t 200 1 t l 1 m d m ext s t d 0 s 200 1 t l 1 m d m x ext s d 0 t 3 5 in the rest of this section we restrict attention to the 2 variable weighted shift with weight diagram given as in figure 2 ii lemma 3 9 let w be a 2 variable weighted shift let 1 s d s and assume that x 20 1 and a 2 1 then w is subnormal if and only if x 20 2 a 2 1 proof observe that the berger measure of x 0 is x 0 x 20 s 1 x 20 0 and similarly the berger measure of a is a a 2 s 1 a 2 0 the restriction of w to the subspace m is then m a from which it follows at once that m x ext a therefore for the subnormality of w we will need x 20 a x 0 and this naturally leads to the condition x 20 2 a 2 1 as desired lemma 3 10 the 2 variable weighted shift w is hyponormal if and only if a x 0 1 x 0 proof since the restrictions of w to the subspaces m and n are sub normal lemma 3 4 says that w is hyponormal if and only if m 0 0 1 11 m 0 0 1 w 0 since m 0 0 1 0 1 x 0 0 a 0 x 0 0 a 0 x 0 0 0 1 x 0 0 it follows that w is hyponormal if and only if a x 0 1 x 0 as desired we observe that if a x 0 then a x 0 1 x 0 becomes a 1 which is always true thus to build an example where the hyponormality of w is violated we must necessarily assume that a x 0 incidentally this assumption automatically leads to a 2 x 20 so that the subnormality of w is now determined by the conditions x 20 1 and x 20 2 a 2 1 in short an example with the desired properties can be constructed once we guarantee the following three conditions x 20 1 3 6 x 20 2 a 2 1 3 7 x 0 1 a 2 3 8 notice that 2 a 2 2 so if we were to assume that x 20 12 then both conditions 3 6 and 3 7 would be simultaneously satisfied moreover if we were to assume that x 0 1 2 then we could always find a x 0 such that x 0 1 a 2 we can then focus on the following question can we simultaneously guarantee x 20 12 and x 2 0 21 4 alternatively we need 21 4 x 20 1 2 3 9 now if 21 4 1 2 then it would be possible to select x 0 such that 3 9 is satisfied we have thus established the following result theorem 3 11 let w be as above and assume that 21 2 then i w is subnormal and ii w is not hyponormal we will now show that the condition in theorem 3 11 holds for a large class of 2 variable weighted shifts example 3 12 consider the case when the measure is 2 atomic that is r p s q with r s 0 r s 1 and 0 p q recall that 0 cannot be in the support of because otherwise 1 s l 1 we compute 21 rp 2 sq 2 rp sq r p s q r s q p 2 r s q p r s q p 12 thus without loss of generality we can always assume that p 1 that is 21 r sq 2 r sq r s q a calculation using mathematica 49 reveals that for 1 q q 1 2 2 1 2 5 4 2 3 546 we have r sq 2 r sq r s q 2 for all r s 0 with r s 1 as a matter of fact there is a region r in the s q plane bounded by the graph q f s of a positive convex function f such that 21 2 precisely when 1 q f s r contains the rectangle 0 1 1 q we have thus established the existence of subnormal 2 variable weighted shifts w with non hyponormal toral aluthge transforms 4 the spherical aluthge transform in this section we study the second plausible definition of the multivariable aluthge transform which we will denote to avoid confusion by t 1 t 2 this corresponds to 1 4 we begin with the following elementary result proposition 4 1 assume that t 1 t 2 v 1 p v 2 p where p t 1 t 1 t 2 t 2 1 2 and let t 1 t 2 t 1 t 2 pv 1 p pv 2 p assume also that t 1 t 2 is commutative then i v 1 v 2 is a joint partial isometry more precisely v 1 v 1 v 2 v 2 is the projection onto ran p ii t 1 t 2 is commutative on ran p so in particular t 1 t 2 is commutative whenever p is injective proof i an easy computation reveals that p 2 t 1 t 1 t 2 t 2 v 1 p v 1 p v 2 p v 2 p p v 1 v 1 v 2 v 2 p and therefore v 1 v 1 v 2 v 2 ran p is the identity operator on ran p as desired to prove ii consider the product t 1 t 2 pv 1 p pv 2 p pv 1 pv 2 p then t 1 t 2 p pt 1 t 2 pt 2 t 1 pv 2 pv 1 p p pv 2 p pv 1 p p t 2 t 1 p it follows at once that t 1 t 2 t 2 t 1 vanishes on ran p as desired we now prove proposition 4 2 given a 2 variable weighted shift w t 1 t 2 let w be given by 1 4 assume that w is commutative then w is commutative 13 proof straightforward from proposition 4 1 we briefly pause to describe how w acts on the canonical orthonormal basis vectors lemma 4 3 let w t 1 t 2 be a 2 variable weighted shift then t 1 ek k 2 k 1 2 k 1 1 4 2 k 2 k 1 4 ek 1 and t 2 ek k 2 k 2 2 k 2 1 4 2 k 2

which the toral and spherical aluthge transforms coincide respectively we next have proposition 4 4 consider a 2 variable weighted shift w t 1 t 2 and assume that w is a commuting pair of hyponormal operators then so is w proof we will establish that t 2 is hyponormal fix a lattice point k 1 k 2 we would like to prove that k 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 1 since the hyponormality of a hilbert space operator is invariant under multiplication by a nonzero scalar we can without loss of generality assume that k 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 1 to simplify the calculation let a k 1 k 2 1 b k 1 k 2 1 c k 1 k 2 2 and 14 d k 1 k 2 2 thus the weight diagram of t 1 t 2 is now given as in figure 3 i since t 2 is hyponormal we must necessarily have a bc a 4 1 in the first column of the weight diagram in figure 3 i recall also the cauchy schwarz inequality a 2 b 2 a 4 b 4 2 then 4 k 1 k 2 a 2 b 2 2 a 2 b 2 2 2 a 2 b 2 a 4 2 a 2 b 2 b 4 2 a 2 b 2 a 4 b 4 a 2 b 2 b 2 c 2 b 2 d 2 a 2 b 2 by 4 1 and the fact that b d b 2 c 2 d 2 a 2 b 2 b 4 c 2 d 2 a 2 b 2 4 k 1 k 2 1 as desired we now present an example of a hyponormal 2 variable weighted shift w for which w is not hyponormal while we have already encountered this behavior cf theorem 3 11 the simplicity of the following example warrants special mention aware as we are that the result is weaker than theorem 3 11 moreover this example shows that the spherical aluthge transform w may be hyponormal even if w is not example 4 5 for 0 x y 1 let w be the 2 variable weighted shift in figure 2 ii where 0 1 2 1 x 0 x a y then i w is subnormal x s y 1 2 y 2 ii w is hyponormal x h y 1 y 2 2 iii w is hyponormal x ca y 1 y 2 iv w is hyponormal x pa y 2 1 y 2 y 4 1 2 1 y 2 1 y 2 y 2 clearly s y h y pa y and ca y h y for all 0 y 1 while ca y s y on 0 q and ca y s y on q 1 where q 0 52138 then w is hyponormal but w is not hyponormal if 0 ca y x h y and w is hyponormal but w is not hyponormal if 0 h y x pa y 5 2 variable weighted shifts with identical aluthge transforms we shall now characterize the class ats of commuting 2 variable weighted shifts w for which the toral and spherical aluthge transforms agree that is w w using lemmas 3 1 and 4 3 it suffices to restrict attention to the equalities 15 k k 1 k 2 k 1 2 k 1 1 4 2 k 2 k 1 4 and k k 2 k 2 k 2 2 k 2 1 4 2 k 2 k 1 4 for all k z 2 thus we easily see that w w if and only if 2 k 1 2 k 2 k 2 k 2 k 1 2 k 1 and 2 k 2 2 k 2 k 2 k 2 k 2 2 k 2 for all k z 2 which is equivalent to k 1 k k k 1 and k 2 k k k 2 for all k z 2 if we now recall condition 2 1 for the commutativity of w that is k k 1 k k 2 for all k z 2 we see at once that w w if and only if k 1 k 2 and k 2 k 1 for all k z 2 it follows that the weight diagram for w is completely determined by the zeroth row and the weight 0 0 for referring to figure 1 i once we have 0 0 and 1 0 we immediately get 0 1 1 0 with 0 0 and 0 1 known we use commutativity and 0 0 to calculate 1 0 since 0 1 1 0 and 0 2 1 1 2 0 we can then calculate 1 1 and 2 0 a similar reasoning yields all remaining k s and k s we will now show that for the purpose of establishing the invariance of k hyponormality under the aluthge transform for the class ats it is enough to assume that 0 0 0 0 this is an immediate consequence of the following well known result lemma 5 1 let t be a bounded linear operator on hilbert space and let t v p be its polar decomposition let a a ei be a complex number written in polar form and define ta at then the polar decomposition of ta is ei v a p as a consequence t a at remark 5 2 by lemma 5 1 to study the toral aluthge transform of w t 1 t 2 ats we can multiply t 2 by the factor 0 0 0 0 this results in a new 2 variable weighted shift for which k k for all k z 2 this subclass of ats is the central subject of the next section observe that while the natural generalization of lemma 5 1 is not true for the spherical aluthge transform it is true when restricted to ats since both the toral and spherical aluthge transforms agree on this class 16 6 when is hyponormality invariant under the toral and spherical aluthge transforms in this section we identify a large class of 2 variable weighted shifts for which the toral ans spherical aluthge transforms do preserve hyponormality this is in some sense optimal since we know that k hyponormality k 2 is not preserved by the 1 variable aluthge transform 45 as mentioned in the introduction since this class is actually a subclass of ats introduced in section 5 it follows at once that all the results we establish for the toral aluthge transform are also true for the spherical aluthge transform we start with some definitions recall that the core c w of w is the restriction of w to the invariant subspace m n w is said to be of tensor form if it is of the form i w w i for some unilateral weighted shifts w and w consider w w on 2 z 2 given by the double indexed weight sequences k 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 for k 1 k 2 0 it is clear that w is a commuting pair and we refer to it as a 2 variable weighted shift with diagonal core 23 this 2 variable weighted shift can be represented by the weight diagram in figure 4 i it is straightforward to observe that the class of shifts of the form w is simply at s with the extra condition 0 0 0 0 for more on these shifts the reader is referred to 23 now we show that the k hyponormality of w implies the k hyponormality of w for this we present a simple criterion to detect the k hyponormality of weighted shifts lemma 6 1 14 let w ei iei 1 i 0 be a hyponormal weighted shift and let k 1 the following statements are equivalent i w is k hyponormal ii the matrix w j w i eu j eu i k i j 1 is positive semi definite for all u 1 iii the hankel matrix h k u w u i j 2 k 1 i j 1 is positive semi definite for all u 0 6 1 preservation of hyponormality we then have proposition 6 2 consider w t 1 t 2 given by figure 4 i then for k 1 w is k hyponormal if and only if w is k hyponormal 17 0 0 1 0 2 0 0 1 1 2 2 3 t 1 t 2 0 1 0 2 0 1 1 2 1 2 i ii t 1 t 2 0 0 1 0 2 0 0 1 1 2 1 2 2 3 2 3 3 4 0 1 1 2 1 2 2 3 figure 4 weight diagram of a generic 2 variable weighted shift w t 1 t 2 and weight diagram of the toral aluthge transform w t 1 t 2 of w respectively proof this is clear from the construction of w and figure 4 i for k 1 we suppose that w is a k hyponormal weighted shift then by lemma 6 1 for all k 1 0 we have that the hankel matrix h k u w u i j 2 w k 1 i j 1 0 by lemma 3 4 we can see that a 2 variable weighted shift w is k hyponormal if and only if mu k w u m n p q 0 n m k 0 p q k 0 6 1 for all u u 1 u 2 z 2 thus for w k hyponormal it is enough to show that mu k 0 for all u z 2 observe that the moments associated with w are u w u 1 u 2 w u 1 u 2 all u z 2 6 2 18 by a direct computation we have mu k w u u 1 u 2 u k 1 u k 2 u 1 u 2 1 u 1 2 u k 1 1 u 1 k 2 u 2 u 1 2 u 2 2 u k 1 2 u k 1 2 u k 1 u k 1 1 u k 1 2 u 2 k 1 u k 1 k 2 u k 2 u 1 k 2 u k 1 2 u k 1 k 2 u 2 k 2 which by 6 2 equals ju k u 1 u 2 u 1 u 2 1 u 1 u 2 k u 1 u 2 k u 1 u 2 1 u 1 u 2 2 u 1 u 2 k 1 u 1 u 2 k 1 u 1 u 2 k u 1 u 2 k 1 u 1 u 2 2 k u 1 u 2 2 k u 1 u 2 k u 1 u 2 k 1 u 1 u 2 2 k u 1 u 2 2 k u 1 u 2 k u 1 u 2 u 1 u 1 u 2 2 k u 1 u 2 2 k u 1 u 2 k u 1 u 2 k 1 u 1 u 2 2 k u 1 u 2 2 k for 1 i k 1 we can observe that the i i 1 2 1 th i i 1 2 2 th i i 1 2 i 1 th rows and columns of ju k are equal thus a direct calculation i e discarding some redundant rows and columns in the matrix ju k shows that ju k 0 lu k 0 6 3 where lu k u 1 u 2 w u 1 u 2 1 w u 1 u 2 k w u 1 u 2 1 w u 1 u 2 2 w u 1 u 2 k 1 w u 1 u 2 k w u 1 u 2 k 1 w u 1 u 2 2 k w note that l u 1 u 2 k 0 h k u 1 u 2 w 0 6 4 19 thus if w is k hyponormal then h k u w 0 for all u 0 which a fortiori implies that mu k w 0 for all u z 2 as desired the proof is now complete now we have the following result theorem 6 3 consider the 2 variable weighted shift w t 1 t 2 given by figure 4 i suppose that w is hyponormal then the toral aluthge transform w w is also hyponormal in view of lemma 5 1 we immediately get corollary 6 4 the conclusion of theorem 6 3 holds in the class at s proof of theorem 6 3 since w is hyponormal by proposition 6 2 w is hyponormal thus we have that for any integer n 0 n n 1 n n 1 n 1 n 2 which implies that w is also hyponormal by proposition 6 2 w is hyponormal as desired remark 6 5 i we construct an example w such that w is not hy ponormal but the aluthge transform w of w is hyponormal con sider the unilateral weighted shift introduced in section 1 that is w shift 1 2 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 w is not hyponormal but the aluthge transform w u is subnormal thus by proposition 6 2 we have that w is not hyponormal but w is hyponormal as desired ii using an argument entirely similar to that in i above one can show that 2 hyponor mality is not preserved by the toral or spherical aluthge transform as in the single variable case we can easily observe that if w is of tensor form that is i w w i then its toral aluthge transform w is also of tensor form however the spherical aluthge transform w is in general not of tensor form in any event hyponormality is invariant under both aluthge transforms when w is of tensor form that the toral aluthge transform preserves hyponormality for these 2 variable weighted shifts is clear we now establish invariance of hyponor mality for the spherical aluthge transform recall first that by proposition 4 4 the spherical aluthge transform is commuting proposition 6 6 let w be a 2 variable weighted shift of tensor form i w w i and assume that w and w are hyponormal then w is hyponormal proof without loss of generality we can assume that w shift x y 1 and w shift a b 1 with 0 x y 1 and 0 a b 1 also it is enough to focus on the six point test at 0 0 cf 13 theorem 6 1 26 theorem 1 3 that is we will check that m 0 0 1 w 0 20 observe that m 0 0 1 w 1 x a y a x a b x a x x a y a x xy a 1 a x ax b y a x a b x a x ax b y a x ab x 1 a x thus we obtain m 0 0 1 w 0 a 0 where a a x x a y a b x x a y xy a 1 ax b y a b x ax b y ab x 1 now modify the 2 2 and 3 3 entries of a and let b a x x a y a b x x a y xy a x ax b y a b x ax b y ab a x a direct calculation using the nested determinant test shows that a b and that b 0 thus we have m 0 0 1 w 0 so that w is hyponormal as desired remark 6 7 one might be tempted to claim that subnormality is also preserved by the toral and spherical aluthge transforms within the class of 2 variable weighted shifts of tensor form however this is not the case indeed in 34 and 35 g exner considered the weighted shift w with 3 atomic berger measure 1 3 0 1 2 1 studied in 25 and proved that the aluthge transform of w is not subnormal 7 continuity properties of the aluthge transforms we turn our attention to the continuity properties of the aluthge transforms of a commuting pair the following result is well known for a single operator t b h the aluthge transform map t t is continuous on b h 32 we want to extend the result to multivariable case first we define the operator norm of t t 1 t 2 as t max t 1 t 2 7 1 theorem 7 1 the toral aluthge transform map t t is contin uous on b h 21 proof straightforward from the definition of t we turn our attention to the continuity properties in b h for the spherical aluthge transform of a commuting pair for this we need a couple of auxil iary results which can be proved by suitable adaptations of the results in 32 lemmas 2 1 and 2 2 lemma 7 2 let t t 1 t 2 v 1 p v 2 p be a pair of commuting operators written in joint polar decomposition form where p t 1 t 1 t 2 t 2 for n n and t 0 let fn t max 1 n t and let an fn t then i an max n 1 2 p 1 2 ii pa 1 n p 1 2 iii an p 1 2 n 12 iv pa 1 n p 1 2 14 n 1 2 v for i 1 2 antia 1 n p 1 2 vip 1 2 54 n 1 2 ti 1 2 lemma 7 3 given r 1 and 0 there are real polynomials p and q such that for every commuting pair t t 1 t 2 with ti r i 1 2 we have p 1 2 vip 1 2 p t 1 t 1 t 2 t 2 tiq t 1 t 1 t 2 t 2 in the statement below refers to the operator norm topology on b h 2 see 7 1 theorem 7 4 the spherical aluthge transform t 1 t 2 t 1 t 2 is continuous on b h proof observe first that vi 1 for i 1 2 as follows from the inequality vipx 2 tix 2 t i tix x p 2 x x px 2 the proof is now an easy consequence of the proof of 32 theorem 2 3 when one uses lemma 7 3 instead of 32 lemma 2 2 8 spectral properties of the aluthge transforms in this section we study whether the multivariable aluthge transforms pre serve the taylor spectrum and taylor essential spectrum when w is in the class t c of 2 variable weighted shifts with core of tensor form this is a large nontrivial class which has been previously studied in 15 20 24 28 and 47 49 22 we begin by looking at the toral aluthge transform by proposition 3 2 and remark 3 3 we note that the weight diagram of w is as in figure 2 i provided the toral aluthge transform is commutative we first address the taylor spectrum lemma 8 1 i 11 15 let h 1 and h 2 be hilbert spaces and let ai b h 1 ci b h 2 and bi b h 1 h 2 i 1 n be such that a 0 b c a 1 0 b 1 c 1 an 0 bn cn is commuting assume that a and a 0 b c are taylor invertible then c is taylor invertible furthermore if a and c are taylor invertible then a 0 b c is taylor invertible ii 16 for a and b two commuting n tuples of bounded operators on hilbert space we have t i a b i t a t b and te i a b i te a t b t a te b to apply lemma 8 1 we first let w shift 0 1 w shift 0 1 w 0 shift x 0 x 1 1 2 w a shift a 0 1 w 2 shift a 0 x 1 0 1 i diag 1 1 d 1 diag y 0 a y 0 x 0 a 0 y 0 x 0 x 1 a 0 y 0 x 0 x 1 and d 2 diag x 1 0 0 0 0 where i is the identity matrix theorem 8 2 consider a commuting 2 variable weighted shift w t 1 t 2 with weight diagram given by figure 2 i assume also that t 1 and t 2 are hy ponormal then t w w d w d and te w w t w d w d w t 8 1 here d denotes the closure of the open unit disk d and t the unit circle proof we represent w t 1 t 2 by block matrices relative to the decom position 2 z 2 2 z 2 z 2 z 2 z 2 z 8 2 then we obtain t 1 w 0 w 1 r 1 and t 2 0 d 1 0 d 2 r 2 23 where r 1 w 2 w 2 and r 2 0 1 i 0 2 i 0 we first consider t w of w t 1 t 2 note the following w w 0 w 1 w 2 and w shift 1 2 shift 0 y 0 x 0 x 1 0 1 8 3 thus by lemma 8 1 i and 8 3 we have t t 1 t 2 t w 0 0 0 w 1 0 0 d 1 0 t i w 2 w i t w 0 0 t w 1 0 t i w 2 w i w d 0 w d w d w d w d 8 4 by lemma 8 1 ii and 8 3 we have t i w 2 w i t w 0 0 0 w 1 0 0 d 1 0 t t 1 t 2 t i w 2 w i t w 0 0 t w 1 0 t t 1 t 2 w d w d w d 0 t t 1 t 2 w d w d w d 0 t t 1 t 2 8 5 since the taylor spectrum t t 1 t 2 is a closed set in c c by 10 1 and 10 2 we can get t w w d w d 8 6 we next consider the taylor essential spectrum te t 1 t 2 ofw t 1 t 2 observe that w 2 is a compact perturbation of w 1 and w 0 also 0 y 0 x 0 x 1 i and 0 i are compact perturbations of d 1 and d 2 respectively thus we have te t 1 t 2 te i w 2 shift 0 y 0 x 0 x 1 0 1 i 8 7 by lemma 8 1 ii and 8 3 we note te i w 2 shift 0 y 0 x 0 x 1 0 1 i te w 2 t w t w 2 te w w t w d w d w t 8 8 therefore our proof is now complete 24 theorem 8 3 case of toral aluthge transform consider a commuting 2 variable weighted shift w t 1 t 2 with weight diagram given by figure 2 i assume also that t 1 and t 2 are hyponormal then t w w d w d and te w w t w d w d w t proof since the structure of the weight diagram for w t 1 t 2 is en tirely similar to that of w t 1 t 2 the results follows by imitating the proof of theorem 8 2 by the results of theorems 8 2 and 8 3 we easily obtain the following result corollary 8 4 consider a commuting 2 variable weighted shift w t 1 t 2 with weight diagram given by figure 2 i assume also that t 1 and t 2 are hy ponormal then t w t w and te w te w remark 8 5 we note that the commutativity property is required to check the taylor spectrum resp taylor essential spectrum of w thus if w t c then w is commuting ii by corollary 8 4 we can see that the taylor spectrum resp taylor essential spectrum of w equals that of w when w is commuting and t 1 and t 2 are hyponormal thus corollary 8 4 gives a partial solution to problem 1 3 we now turn our attention to the case of the spherical aluthge transform we need a preliminary result proposition 8 6 let w t c with core c w i w w i then w t c if and only c w ri u w i or c w i w u si for some r s 0 proof by lemma 4 3 we recall that t 1 ek k 2 k 1 2 k 1 1 4 2 k 2 k 1 4 ek 1 and t 2 ek k 2 k 2 2 k 2 1 4 2 k 2 k 1 4 ek 2 8 9 since w t c and since w leaves the subspace m n invariant it readily follows that the spherical aluthge transform of c w is c w as a result we may assume without loss of generality that w i 25 w w i where w and w are unilateral weighted shifts now by 8 9 for all k k 1 k 2 z 2 we have t 1 ek t 1 ek 2 2 k 1 1 2 k 2 2 k 1 2 k 2 2 k 1 1 2 k 2 1 2 k 1 2 k 2 1 t 2 ek t 1 ek 1 2 k 2 1 2 k 2 2 k 1 2 k 1 1 k 2 1 k 2 or k 1 1 k 1 if there exists k 2 z such that k 2 1 6 k 2 then for all k 1 z we must have k 1 1 k 1 that is k 1 0 for all k 1 on the other hand if k 2 1 k 2 for all k 2 z then k 2 0 for all k 2 this completes the proof we are now ready to state theorem 8 7 case of spherical aluthge transform let w t 1 t 2 t c be as in proposition 8 6 assume also that t 1 and t 2 are hyponormal then t w t w and te w te w proof by proposition 8 6 without loss of generality we may assume c w ri u w i for some r 0 recall that t 1 ek k 2 k 1 2 k 1 1 4 2 k 2 k 1 4 ek 1 and t 2 ek k 2 k 2 2 k 2 1 4 2 k 2 k 1 4 ek 2 8 10 by 8 10 we obtain c w ri u w i i u w i where w shift r 2 21 r 2 20 1 4 r 2 22 r 2 21 1 4 r 2 23 r 2 22 1 4 with wr 1 and denotes schur product note that shift 0 0 1 0 shift 0 0 1 0 shift 2 1 0 2 1 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 1 4 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 1 0 2 1 0 1 4 and shift 0 0 1 0 shift 0 0 1 0 shift 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 0 2 0 0 1 4 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 1 2 0 1 1 4 26 since shift 2 1 0 2 1 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 1 4 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 1 0 2 1 0 1 4 2 3 0 2 3 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 1 4 shift 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 0 2 0 0 1 4 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 1 2 0 1 1 4 2 0 3 2 0 3 2 0 2 2 0 2 1 4 1 we have shift 0 0 1 0 2 0 shift 0 0 1 0 2 0 8 11 and shift 0 0 1 0 2 0 shift 0 0 0 1 0 2 8 12 thus by the method used in the proof of theorem 8 2 we have t w t w observe now that 8 11 and 8 12 also show that the weighted shifts associated with 0 th row and the 0 th column of w are compact perturbations of the corresponding weighted shifts for w as a result it is straightforward to conclude that te w te w this completes the proof of the theorem in view of corollary 8 4 remark 8 5 and theorem 8 7 it is natural to formulate the following conjecture 8 8 let w be a commuting 2 variable weighted shift whose toral and spherical aluthge transforms are also commuting then w w and w all have the same taylor spectrum and the same taylor essential spectrum 9 aluthge transforms of the drury arveson shift in this section we consider the drury arveson 2 variable weighted shift da whose weight sequences are given by k 1 k 2 k 1 1 k 1 k 2 1 for all k 1 k 2 0 9 1 k 1 k 2 k 2 k 1 for all k 1 k 2 0 9 2 if we denote the successive rows of the weight diagram of da by r 1 r 2 it is easy to see that r 1 a 1 the unweighted unilateral shift r 2 a 2 the 27 bergman shift and more generally rj aj the agler j th shift j 2 in particular all rows and columns are subnormal weighted shifts for j 2 the berger measure of aj is j 1 sj 2 ds on the closed interval 0 1 and therefore all the berger measures associated with rows 1 2 3 are mutually absolutely continuous a necessary condition for the subnormality of da however the berger measure of the first row ds on 0 1 is not absolutely continuous with respect to 1 which is the berger measure of u the zeroth row and therefore da cannot be subnormal by 27 in fact a stronger result is true da is not jointly hyponormal as a simple application of the six point test at 0 0 reveals it is also known that da t 1 t 2 is essentially normal in fact the com mutators t j ti i j 1 2 are in the schatten p class for p 2 as shown by w a arveson 3 in the sequel we prove compactness of the commutators us ing the homogeneous decomposition of 2 z 2 this will eventually help us prove that the aluthge transforms of da are compact perturbations of da let pn denote the finite dimensional vector space generated by the orthonormal basis vectors e n 0 e n 1 1 e 0 n it is easy to see that pn is invariant under the action of the self commutators t i ti and the cross commutators t j ti i j 1 2 a simple calculation reveals that t 1 t 1 e 0 k 2 1 k 2 1 e 0 k 2 t 1 t 1 e k 1 k 2 k 2 k 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 1 e k 1 k 2 so that in pn we have t 1 t 1 e k 1 n k 1 n k 1 n n 1 it follows that the norm of t 1 t 1 restricted to pn is bounded by 1 n 1 since t 1 t 1 is unitarily equivalent to the orthogonal direct sum of its restrictions to the subspaces pn we easily conclude that t 1 t 1 is compact the calculation for t 2 t 2 is identical in terms of t 2 t 1 one again computes first the action on a generic basis vector in pn that is t 2 t 1 e n 0 0 t 2 t 1 e k 1 n k 1 1 n n 1 k 1 1 n k 1 e k 1 1 n k 1 1 k 1 1 it follows that t 2 t 1 e k 1 n k 1 1 n n 1 k 1 1 n k 1 1 2 n 0 k 1 n as before t 2 t 1 is an orthogonal direct sum of its restrictions to the subspaces pn so the previous estimate proves that t 2 t 1 is compact as a result we know that da is essentially normal we will now study how much the aluthge transforms of da differ from da 28 theorem 9 1 i d a is a compact perturbation of da ii d a is a compact perturbation of da proof i we first note that the weight sequences and of da satisfy 3 2 that is d a is commuting next we observe that d a maps pn into pn 1 cf lemma 3 1 just as da does as a result the compactness of da d a will be established once we prove that da d a pn tends to zero as n toward this end we calculate t 1 t 1 e k 1 n k 1 k 1 n k 1 k 1 n k 1 k 1 1 n k 1 e k 1 1 n k 1 without loss of generality we focus instead on the expression toral k 1 n k 1 4 k 1 n k 1 k 1 1 n k 1 4 with the aid of mathematica 49 we obtain toral k 1 n k 1 4 k 1 n k 1 k 1 1 n k 1 4 k 1 1 n k 1 n 1 2 n 2 1 4 n 2 thus limn da d a pn 0 and therefore da d a is compact ii as in i above it suffices to prove that da d a pn tends to zero as n since t 1 t 1 e k 1 n k 1 k 1 n k 1 k 1 n k 1 2 k 1 1 n k 1 2 k 1 1 n k 1 2 k 1 n k 1 2 k 1 n k 1 1 4 e k 1 1 n k 1 we can again focus on the expression spherical k 1 n k 1 4 k 1 n k 1 2 k 1 1 n k 1 2 k 1 1 n k 1 2 k 1 n k 1 2 k 1 n k 1 1 4 4 a computation using mathematica 49 shows that spherical k 1 1 n k 1 2 n 1 n 2 n 1 2 2 n 1 4 n 2 we thus conclude as before that da d a is compact corollary 9 2 the 2 variable weighted shifts da d a and d a all share the same taylor spectral picture proof since the taylor essential spectrum and the fredholm index are invari ant under compact perturbations cf 12 the result follows from the well know spectral picture of da that is t da b 2 te da b 2 and index da index d a index d a here b 2 denotes the unit ball in c 2 and b 2 its topological boundary 29 remark 9 3 it is an easy application of the six point test that neither d a nor d a is jointly hyponormal 10 fixed points of the spherical aluthge transform spherically quasinormal pairs in this section we discuss the structure of 2 variable weighted shifts which are fixed points for the spherical aluthge transform we believe this notion provides the proper generalization of quasinormality to several variables as we noted in the introduction a hilbert space operator t is quasinormal if and only if t t we use this as our point of departure for the 2 variable case definition 10 1 a commuting pair t t 1 t 2 is spherically quasinormal if t t we now recall the class of spherically isometric commuting pairs of operators 5 6 7 33 37 38 definition 10 2 a commuting n tuple t t 1 tn is a spherical isome try if t 1 t 1 t ntn i in the literature spherical quasinormality of a commuting n tuple t t 1 tn is associated with the commutativity of each ti with p 2 it is not hard to prove that for 2 variable weighted shifts this is equivalent to requiring that w t 1 t 2 be a fixed point of the spherical aluthge transform that is w w a straightforward calculation shows that this is equiv alent to requiring that each ui commutes with p in particular u 1 u 2 is commuting whenever t 1 t 2 is commuting also recall from section 1 that a commuting pair t is a spherical isometry if p 2 i thus in the case of spher ically quasinormal 2 variable weighted shifts we always have u 1 u 1 u 2 u 2 i in the following result the key new ingredient is the equivalence of i and ii as we noted in the introduction the operator q v 1 v 1 v 2 v 2 is a joint partial isometry for pq 2 p p 2 from which it follows that q is isometric on the range of p in the case when p is injective we see that a commuting pair t t 1 t 2 v 1 p v 2 p is spherically quasinormal if and only if each ti commutes with p 2 and if and only if each vi commutes with p 2 i 1 2 in particular v 1 v 2 is commuting whenever t 1 t 2 is commuting observe also that when p is injective we always have v 1 v 1 v 2 v 2 i the proof of the following result is a straightforward application of definition 10 2 lemma 10 3 a 2 variable weighted shift w is a spherical isometry if and only if 2 k 2 k 1 for all k z 2 30 lemma 10 4 a 2 variable weighted shift t is spherically quasinormal if and only if there exists c 0 such that 1 c t is a spherical isometry that is t 1 t 1 t 2 t 2 i proof assume that t t 1 t 2 is commuting and spherically quasinormal then t 1 and t 2 commute with p we now consider the following claim for all k k 1 k 2 z 2 2 k 2 k is constant for the proof of claim if we fix an orthonormal basis vector ek then t 1 ek kek 1 and t 2 ek kek 2 where 1 1 0 and 2 0 1 we thus obtain pt 1 ek k 1 k 2 2 k 1 1 k 2 2 k 1 1 k 2 and t 1 pek 2 k 1 k 2 2 k 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 it follows that 2 k 1 1 k 2 2 k 1 1 k 2 2 k 1 k 2 2 k 1 k 2 10 1 we also have pt 2 ek k 1 k 2 2 k 1 k 2 1 2 k 1 k 2 1 and t 2 pek 2 k 1 k 2 2 k 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 hence we have 2 k 1 k 2 1 2 k 1 k 2 1 2 k 1 k 2 2 k 1 k 2 10 2 therefore by 10 1 and 10 2 for all k k 1 k 2 z 2 we obtain 2 k 1 k 2 2 k 1 k 2 2 k 1 1 k 2 2 k 1 1 k 2 2 k 1 k 2 1 2 k 1 k 2 1 10 3 we have thus established the claim it follows that c 2 k 1 k 2 2 k 1 k 2 is independent of k as a result 1 c t is a spherical isometry as desired by the proof of lemma 10 4 we remark that once the zero th row of t 1 call it w 0 is given then the entire 2 variable weighted shift is fully determined we shall return to this in subsection 10 1 we now recall a result of a athavale theorem 10 5 5 a spherical isometry is always subnormal by lemma 10 4 we immediately obtain 31 corollary 10 6 a spherically quasinormal 2 variable weighted shift is subnor mal we mention in passing two more significant features of spherical isometries theorem 10 7 46 spherical isometries are hyporeflexive theorem 10 8 33 for every n 3 there exists a non normal spherical isometry t such that the polynomially convex hull of t t is contained in the unit sphere remark 10 9 i a athavale and s poddar have recently proved that a com muting spherically quasinormal pair is always subnormal 6 proposition 2 1 this provides a different proof of corollary 10 6 ii in a different direction let qt x t 1 xt 1 t 2 xt 2 by induction it is easy to prove that if t is spherically quasinormal then qn t i qt i n n 0 by 8 remark 4 6 t is subnormal 10 1 construction of spherical isometries in the class of 2 variable weighted shifts there is a simple description of spherical isometries in terms of the weight sequences and which we now present since spherical isometries are jointly subnormal we know that the zeroth rowmust be subnormal start then with a subnormal unilateral weighted shift and denote its weights by k 0 k 0 1 2 using the identity 2 k 2 k 1 k z 2 10 4 and the above mentioned zeroth row we can compute k 0 for k 0 1 2 with these new values available we can use the commutativity property 2 1 to generate the values of in the first row see figure 1 that is k 1 k 0 k 1 0 k 0 we can now repeat the algorithm and calculate the weights k 1 for k 0 1 2 again using the identity 10 4 this is turn leads to the weights for the second row and so on this simple construction of spherically isometric 2 variable weighted shifts will allow us to study properties like recursiveness tied to the existence of finitely atomic berger measures and propagation of recursive relations we pursue these ideas in an upcoming manuscript acknowledgments preliminary versions of some of the results in this paper have been announced in 31 some of the
