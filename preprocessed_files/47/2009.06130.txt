introduction given a bounded sequence of positive numbers and its associated unilateral weighted shift w acting on the hilbert space 2 z we consider natural representations of w as a 2 variable weighted shift acting on the hilbert space 2 z 2 alternatively we seek to examine the various ways in which the sequence can give rise to a 2 variable weight diagram corresponding to a 2 variable weighted shift w 1 our best and more general embedding arises from looking at two polynomials p and q nonnegative on a closed interval i r and the double indexed moment sequence p r kq r d r k z where w is assumed to be subnormal with berger measure such that supp i we call such an embedding a p q embedding of w and denoted as w when p r q r r r 0 we recover the classical embedding discussed in 13 and 19 when p r r and q r 1 r r 0 1 we obtain the 2 variable spherically isometric embedding studied in 14 19 and 20 here 2 k 2 k 1 for all k z 2 and when p r r 2 and q r r 3 we generate a neil parabolic embedding we first prove that every p q embedding of a subnormal weighted shift w is jointly subnormal and we explicitly compute its berger measure next we use polynomial embed dings to give answers to several open problems regarding spherically quasinormal 2 variable weighted shifts constructed from w we do these by appealing to techniques from the theory of disintegration of measures riesz functionals and the functional calculus for the columns of the moment matrix associated to a polynomial embedding in a different direction we recall that for a unilateral weighted shift w it is well known that the hyponormality ofw implies the hyponormality of every integer powerw m m 1 we use our theory of polynomial embeddings to build a jointly hyponormal 2 variable weighted shift w such that some integer power of it is not hyponormal as another application we find an alternative way to compute the berger measure of the agler j th shift aj j 2 1 hereafter z denotes the set of nonnegative integers 0 1 2 3 2 one of the by products of our research is the fact that some questions pertaining to unilateral weighted shifts and therefore within the realm of single variable operator theory can be answered after rephrasing them in the context of p q embeddings a topic that rightly belongs in multivariable operator theory the organization of the paper is as follows in section 2 we discuss spherical quasinor mality both for commuting pairs of operators and more specifically for 2 variable weighted shifts these topics require basic knowledge of unilateral and 2 variable weighted shifts and of the basic construction of spherically isometric 2 variable weighted shifts the interested reader will find a summary of each such topic in the appendix section 7 in section 3 we introduce polynomial embeddings and we prove one of our main results every poly nomial embedding of a subnormal unilateral weighted shift is subnormal section 4 is devoted to the specific case of the classical embedding we then use the neil parabolic embedding r 7 r 2 r 3 to study some examples linking the k hyponormality of w to the k hyponormality of the 2 3 power of w in particular we use polynomial embeddings to give an alternative proof that hyponormality of 2 variable weighted shifts is not preserved under powers cf 12 14 along the way we exhibit the connection between the respec tive berger measures in section 5 we find a concrete formula for the berger measure of the spherically isometric embedding of the bergman shift this solves question 5 15 in 20 in section 6 we first give an alternative solution to problem 1 1 ii that employs techniques from the theory of recursively generated weighted shifts we conclude section 6 with two examples that illustrate our solution to problem 1 1 we now present a precise formulation of the central questions of this paper problem 1 1 20 consider a spherically quasinormal 2 variable weighted shift w and let be the berger measure of w 0 shift 0 0 1 0 since w is subnormal by 20 theorem 3 10 let be its berger measure i describe in terms of ii assume that w 0 is recursively generated that is is finitely atomic it is known that 3 is also finitely atomic and that supp supp c supp where c 0 is the constant of spherical quasinormality 20 theorem 5 2 what else can we say can we give a concrete formula for the atoms and densities of problem 1 2 20 assume that w 0 is the bergman shift b shift 1 2 2 3 3 4 and use subsection 2 3 to build a spherically quasinormal 2 variable weighted shift w cf figure 1 observe that the j th row is identical to the j column for every j 0 note also that w is a close relative of the drury arveson 2 variable weighted shift in that the j row of w is the agler j 2 th shift aj 2 what is the berger measure of w t 1 t 2 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 1 2 2 3 3 4 1 3 2 4 3 5 1 4 2 5 3 6 1 2 2 3 3 4 1 3 2 4 3 5 1 4 2 5 3 6 the 2 variable weighted shift w whose weight diagram is shown on the left has the following properties i 2 k 1 k 2 2 k 1 k 2 1 for all k 1 k 2 z 2 ii w is a spherical isometry iii the weights in the j row correspond to the agler j 2 th shift aj 2 figure 1 weight diagram of the 2 variable weighted shift in problem 1 2 it is now natural to ask problem 1 3 given a subnormal unilateral weighted shift w can we always construct a spherically quasinormal 2 variable weighted shifts w in those instances when this is possible we shall use the notation sqne for the spherically quasinormal embedding for the next question recall that a subnormal unilateral weighted shift is recursively generated if and only if its berger measure is finitely atomic cf subsection 7 2 in the appendix 4 problem 1 4 i let w be a recursively generated weighted shift and let m be a positive integer is wm a direct sum of recursively generated weighted shifts ii conversely assume that wm is a direct sum of recursively generated weighted shifts for some m 1 is w a recursively generated weighted shift we will prove that problem 1 4 i has a positive answer but ii does not in fact w may not even be subnormal we can then ask under what conditions does problem 1 4 ii yield a positive answer for a subnormal 2 variable weighted shift w it is natural to say that it is recursively generated if its berger measure is finitely atomic we shall see in theorem 1 8 that the property of being recursively generated transfers fromw to any p q embedding we plan to build on this fact and study recursively generated 2 variable weighted shifts in detail in a forthcoming paper problem 1 5 let w be a hyponormal unilateral weighted shift and let w w denote the 2 variable weighted shift obtained via the classical embedding that is the p q embedding with p r q r r r 0 w 2 also let m and n be two positive integers and consider the power w m n is w m n hyponormal hereafter we will ordinarily use the notation w for three reasons i it easily signals the action of the classical embedding on 1 variable sequences ii it more clearly denotes that it is a weighted shift and iii it is more concise that allows for a succinct display of the powers we conclude this section by stating our main results which provide answers to the above mentioned problems theorem 1 6 let w be a p q embedding of w and let f r p r q r if w is subnormal with berger measure such that p supp 0 and q supp 0 then w is subnormal with berger measure f 1 5 theorem 1 7 the bergman shift b admits a spherically isometric embedding whose berger measure is normalized arclength on the line segment s t r 2 s t 1 theorem 1 8 let w be a p q embedding of w where w is subnormal with finitely atomic berger measure 1 i 0 i ri 1 i 0 i 1 i 0 and 0 r 0 r 1 r 1 then the berger measure of w is 1 i 0 i p ri q ri 1 1 as a consequence we can generalize theorem 1 7 as follows theorem 1 9 let w be a p q embedding of a subnormal weighted shift w and denote by and the berger measures of w and w respectively assume that is the lebesgue measure on 0 1 then d p r q r is normalized arclength on the curve c p r q r 0 r 1 related to problem 1 4 we have theorem 1 10 if w is subnormal and if w m is a direct sum of recursively generated weighted shifts then w is a recursively generated weighted shift 2 notation and preliminaries 2 1 spherically quasinormal n tuples of operators let h be a complex hilbert space and let b h denote the algebra of all bounded linear operators on h we say that t b h is normal if t t tt quasinormal if t commutes with t t i e tt t t t 2 subnormal if t n h where n is normal and n h h and hyponormal if t t tt for the 1 variable case we clearly have that normal quasinormal subnormal hyponormal 6 for s t b h let s t st ts we say that an n tuple t t 1 tn of operators on h is jointly hyponormal if the operator matrix t t t 1 t 1 t n t 1 t 1 tn t n tn is positive on the direct sum of n copies of h cf 1 6 the n tuple t is said to be normal if t is commuting and each ti is normal and subnormal if t is the restriction of a normal n tuple to a common invariant subspace a commuting n tuple t is k hyponormal if the tuple t 1 tn t 21 t 1 t 2 t 2 n t k 1 t k 11 t 2 t kn is jointly hyponormal following a athavale s podder 3 and j gleason 22 we say that i t is matricially quasinormal if ti commutes with t j tk for all i j k 1 n ii t is jointly quasinormal if ti commutes with t j tj for all i j 1 n and iii t is spherically quasinormal if ti commutes with p t 1 t 1 t ntn for i 1 n then normal matricially quasinormal jointly quasinormal spherically quasinormal subnormal 3 proposition 2 1 k hyponormal hyponormal 2 1 on the other hand results of r e curto s h lee and j yoon cf 14 and of j gleason 22 show that the reverse implications in 2 1 do not necessarily hold in 20 theorem 2 2 r e curto and j yoon showed that the spherically quasinormal commuting pairs are precisely the fixed points of the spherical aluthge transform in 19 7 it was also shown that every spherically quasinormal 2 variable weighted shift is a positive multiple of a spherical isometry see theorem 2 3 in order to state this result we need a brief discussion of unilateral and 2 variable weighted shifts we refer the reader to subsections 7 1 and 7 3 of the appendix 2 2 spherically quasinormal 2 variable weighted shifts in this section we present a characterization of spherical quasinormality for 2 variable weighted shifts which was an nounced in 18 and proved in 19 and 20 before we state it we list some simple facts about quasinormality for 2 variable weighted shifts remark 2 1 cf 14 we first observe that no 2 variable weighted shift can be matricially quasinormal as a simple calculation shows also a 2 variable weighted shift w is jointly quasinormal if and only if k 1 k 2 0 0 and k 1 k 2 0 0 for all k 1 k 2 0 this can be seen via a simple application of 7 5 and 7 6 as a result up to a scalar multiple in each component a quasinormal 2 variable weighted shift is identical to the so called helton howe shift this fact is entirely consistent with the one variable result a unilateral weighted shift w is quasinormal if and only if w c u for some c 0 we now recall the class of spherically isometric commuting pairs of operators cf 2 3 22 a commuting pair t t 1 t 2 is a spherical isometry if t 1 t 1 t 2 t 2 i lemma 2 2 2 proposition 2 any spherical isometry is subnormal theorem 2 3 14 theorem 3 1 cf 19 lemma 10 3 for a commuting 2 variable weighted shift w t 1 t 2 the following statements are equivalent i w is a spherically quasinormal 2 variable weighted shift ii algebraic condition t 1 t 1 t 2 t 2 ci for some constant c iii weight condition for all k 1 k 2 z 2 2 k 1 k 2 2 k 1 k 2 c for some constant c 0 iv moment condition for all k 1 k 2 z 2 k 1 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 1 c k 1 k 2 for some constant c 0 8 corollary 2 4 any spherically quasinormal 2 variable weighted shift is subnormal it is now natural to ask problem 2 5 given a subnormal unilateral weighted shift w can we always construct a spherically quasinormal 2 variable weighted shifts w in particular if w b the bergman shift or if w shift a b b with 0 a b 1 can we construct a spherically quasinormal 2 variable weighted shift w for the case of the bergman shift figure 1 shows the desired spherical isometry thus in the case of the bergman shift we can obtain a spherically isometric embedding which we will denote by sie while this can be established via a detailed calculation we shall prove in section 3 a much more general result linking concretely the berger measures of w and w for the second shift observe that its berger measure is 1 ab 2 0 a b 2 b 2 from this one can show that w does admit a spherically isometric extension whose berger measure is 1 a b 2 0 1 a b 2 b 2 1 b 2 2 3 construction of spherically quasinormal 2 variable weighted shifts as ob served in 20 section 4 within the class of 2 variable weighted shifts there is a simple description of spherical isometries in terms of the weight sequences k 1 k 2 and k 1 k 2 indeed since spherical isometries are jointly subnormal we know that the unilateral weighted shift associated with each row is subnormal and in particular the 0 th row in the weight diagram corresponds to a contractive subnormal unilateral weighted shift let us denote its weights by k 0 k 0 1 2 and its berger measure by also in view of theorem 2 3 we can assume that c 1 we may also assume without loss of generality that is strictly increasing using the identity 2 k 2 k 1 k z 2 2 2 we immediately see that k 0 1 2 k 0 for k 0 1 2 with these new values at our disposal we can use the commutativity property 7 5 to generate the values of in the 9 first row that is k 1 k 0 k 1 0 k 0 2 3 let us briefly pause to observe that starting with the sequence k 0 k 0 for the 0 th row we have been able to generate the sequence k 1 k 0 for the first row now the 0 row sequence came with a berger measure does the new sequence have a berger measure let us look at the moments of 0 w 1 and for k 1 k w 2 0 1 2 1 1 2 k 1 1 1 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 1 0 2 k 1 0 2 k 0 by 2 3 1 2 0 0 k w 2 k 0 1 2 0 0 k w 1 2 k 0 by 2 2 1 2 0 0 k w k 1 w 1 2 0 0 rkd r rk 1 d r 1 2 0 0 rk 1 r d r it is now evident that does have a berger measure given by d r 1 2 0 0 1 r d r this is entirely consistent with the fact that in any subnormal 2 variable weighted shift with berger measure d s t the berger measures 1 and 0 of the first and 0 th rows respectively are related by the equation d 1 s 1 0 1 t 0 s also note that for the new sequence k 1 k 0 1 for all k 0 we can now repeat the algorithm and calculate the weights k 1 for k 0 1 2 again using the identity 2 2 this in turn leads to the weights for the second row and so on for more on this construction the reader is referred to 20 in particular it is worth noting that the construction may stall if the sequence k 0 k 0 is not strictly increasing see proposition 2 6 moreover the fact that we can determine concretely the berger 10 measures of each row and each column if we were to start with the 0 column and apply the algorithm does not guarantee the existence of a berger measure for the 2 variable weighted shift that comes from either corollary 2 4 or the more general theorem 1 6 proved in section 3 as we know from 16 it is possible for a commuting 2 variable weighted shift to have rows and columns with mutually absolutely continuous berger measures and still not be jointly subnormal thus in the case of 2 variable weighted shifts the lifting problem for commuting subnormals entails more than the subnormality of rows and columns see for instance 7 15 16 proposition 2 6 7 proposition 12 14 let 0 0 p 1 0 q 2 0 r and 3 0 r and assume that 0 p q r 1 then the algorithm described in this section fails at some stage as a consequence there does not exist a spherical isometry interpolating these initial data remark 2 7 a in proposition 2 6 the reader may have noticed that the 0 th row is not subnormal for it is well known that up to a constant the only subnormal unilateral weighted shifts with two equal weights are u and sa 29 theorem 6 thus save for these two special trivial cases assuming subnormality of the 0 th row will automatically guarantee that k 0 is strictly increasing therefore in the sequel we will always assume that the 0 th row is subnormal b while the 0 th row of the shift in proposition 2 6 is not subnormal not even quadratically hyponormal it is possible to prove that the algorithm also stalls with a 0 th row of the form 3 4 2 3 3 4 4 5 which is a rank one perturbation of b we shall prove in theorem 3 5 that the construction algorithm always works when the 0 th row is subnormal 11 3 polynomial embeddings of unilateral weighted shifts let i be a closed interval in r consider a one parametric representation of a planar curve c described by a function f i r 2 given by f r s t p r q r where p q are nonnegative real polynomials on i and f is injective assume thatw is a subnormal unilateral weighted shift with berger measure and such that supp i that is k w 2 0 2 1 2 k 1 i rkd r 3 1 definition 3 1 the polynomial embedding pe f of w via the pair f p q is the 2 variable weighted shift w with moments k 1 k 2 i p r k 1 q r k 2 d r 3 2 if we knew that pe f is subnormal with berger measure the moment equations would be sk 1 tk 2 d s t k 1 k 2 i p r k 1 q r k 2 d r sk 1 tk 2 d f 1 s t after using the change of variables s p r t q r this gives the heuristics for the following result theorem 3 2 cf problems 1 1 and 1 3 let w be a p q embedding of w if w is subnormal with berger measure then w is subnormal with berger measure f 1 proof define a probability measure on r 2 by e f 1 e for all borel sets e in r 2 now compute the moments of and compare them to those in 3 2 the classical embedding we now recall the 2 variable weighted shift embedding in troduced and studied in 13 and 19 given a 1 variable unilateral weighted shift w we 12 embed into z 2 as follows k 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 0 3 3 we denote the associated 2 variable weighted by w see figure 2 i we will also use the notation ce we also recall that a probability measure on x x is said to be diagonal if supp s s s x 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 0 1 2 1 2 3 2 3 4 t 1 t 2 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 1 2 1 2 3 2 3 4 i ii t 1 h 2 3 0 0 t 2 h 2 3 0 0 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 0 1 2 3 4 5 3 4 5 6 7 8 6

of m and n ii weight diagram used in example 3 10 lemma 3 3 13 a let w be a unilateral weighted shift let w be the classical em bedding of and let k 1 then w is k hyponormal if and only if w is k hyponormal 3 4 b w is subnormal if and only if w is subnormal in this case the berger measure of w is diagonal moreover x is the berger measure of w example 3 4 let w w and k 1 k 2 be as in 3 2 if p r r and q r r then the p q embedding w of w is the embedding considered in 13 that is 13 w w or equivalently k 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 for all k 1 k 2 0 1 2 see figure 2 i to prove this observe that k 1 k 2 w rk 1 rk 2 d r rk 1 k 2 d r k 1 k 2 w and therefore k 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 all k 1 k 2 0 1 2 as desired the spherically quasinormal embedding we now state and prove that starting with a non flat subnormal shiftw the construction described in subsection 2 3 always leads to a spherically quasinormal embedding theorem 3 5 cf problem 1 1 i and problems 1 2 and 1 3 let w be a subnormal unilateral weighted shift with berger measure and let f 1 where f r r c r where c w 2 then the 2 variable weighted shift pe f is a spherically quasinormal embedding of w proof we know that pe f is subnormal and that supp r c r r 0 c then k 1 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 1 sk 1 1 tk 2 d s t sk 1 tk 2 1 d s t s t sk 1 tk 2 d s t csk 1 tk 2 d s t c k 1 k 2 for all k 1 k 2 z by theorem 2 3 iv we see that pe f is spherically quasinormal as desired 14 p q embeddings of recursively generated weighted shifts theorem 3 6 cf problem 1 1 ii letw be a p q embedding 2 variable weighted shift where w is subnormal with finitely atomic berger measure 1 i 0 i ri 1 i 0 i 1 i 0 and 0 r 0 r 1 r 1 1 then the berger measure of w is 1 i 0 i p ri q ri 3 5 proof a moment s thought reveals that without loss of generality we can assume that p r rm and q r rn where m and n are positive integers we first observe that supp p r q r 0 r 1 since sk 1 tk 2 tm sn d s t sk 1 tk 2 m sk 1 ntk 2 d s t 0 1 rmk 1 rn k 2 m rm k 1 n rnk 2 d r 0 for all k 1 k 2 0 we easily see that tm sn a e thus supp rm rn 0 r 1 the rest of the proof will follow once we establish the next two claims claim 1 if s 0 then sm 0 sn 0 proof of claim 1 observe that for all k 1 k 2 z 2 mk 1 nk 2 w 0 1 rmk 1 nk 2 d r 0 1 p r k 1 q r k 2 d r k 1 k 2 w it follows that sk 1 tk 2 d s 0 s 0 s t s mk 1 0 s nk 2 0 s mk 1 nk 2 0 rmk 1 nk 2 d s 0 r mk 1 nk 2 k 1 k 2 w thus we must have sm 0 sn 0 claim 2 if 1 i 0 i si then 1 i 0 i smi s n i 15 proof of claim 2 this is straightforward corollary 3 7 letw be a polynomial embedding ofw and let and f p q be as in theorem 3 2 that is d p r q r d r then d p r q r x d p r and d p r q r y d q r where for a measure x and y denote the marginal measures of alternatively recall that f 1 then x p 1 3 6 and y q 1 as a consequence x p and y q so that x p y q in the case when is the lebesgue measure on 0 1 we see that d x s d p 1 s p 1 s ds and d y t d q 1 t q 1 t dt 16 for additional details on marginal measures the reader is referred to subsection 7 4 in the appendix proof we focus on the marginal measure x from subsection 7 4 we know that x 1 x therefore d x p r d p r q r d r where we have used the injectivity of f to claim that there is a unique point p r q r projecting onto p r then x p or x p 1 as desired for the reader s convenience we also provide an alternative proof that uses techniques from convex analysis first observe that the result is obvious if is a point mass r in 3 6 as a consequence the result is also true for finitely atomic measures moreover we know that these point masses are the extreme points of the unit ball of the space of probability borel measures on either a closed interval in r or a closed rectangle in r 2 next each such probability borel measure is the w limit of a net of finitely atomic measures since the map that sends to its marginal measures x and y is w continuous it follows that corollary 3 7 now holds for all probability borel measures it is well known that for continuous functions on a closed interval the lebesgue integral can be calculated as a limit of riemann sums over partitions whose norms tend to zero 28 we shall use this fact to find explicitly the berger measure of a p q embedding from the berger measure of the original unilateral weighted shift when the latter is the bergman 17 shift concretely we prove that the berger measure of every p q embedding of b is normalized arclength on the graph of p q theorem 3 8 cf problem 1 2 let w be a p q embedding of a subnormal weighted shift w and denote by and the berger measures of w and w respectively assume that is the lebesgue measure on 0 1 then d p r q r is normalized arclength on the curve c p r q r 0 r 1 proof consider a partition p 0 r 0 r 1 rn 1 and let p denote the norm of p the net n 1 i 0 ri 1 ri r i p running over the partially ordered set of all partitions p converges in the w topology to the lebesgue measure on 0 1 as usual the points r i belong to the interval ri ri 1 for a continuous function g on 0 1 a typical riemann sum is of the form n 1 i 0 ri 1 ri g r i thus it can be interpreted as integration with respect to the 2 variable finitely atomic measure n 1 i 0 ri 1 ri p r i q r i 3 7 given by theorem 1 8 we also know that the support of is contained in the curve c thus the set p c p r 0 q r 0 p r n 1 q r n 1 is a partition in the curve c which can be used to approximate the lebesgue measure on c moreover since the riemann sum over the original partition p thought of as an integral with respect to a finitely atomic measure has total mass equal to 1 the finitely atomic measure associated to the partition p c is a probability measure it follows that the finitely atomic measures involved in 3 7 are probability measures as will be any w limit of that net if we could establish that the norm of p c p c is majorized by a constant multiple of p it would then follow that the riemann sums in 3 7 w converge to normalized lebesgue measure on c that is it would w converge to normalized arclength to complete the proof we observe that the distance between two consecutive points in p c is at most 2 max p q p and this quantity majorizes p c where 18 p and q denote the derivatives of p and q respectively observe that the norm is calculated over the interval 0 1 example 3 9 on the closed interval 0 1 consider the p q embedding w gen erated by the nonnegative polynomials p r r and q r r 1 r by theorem 3 2 the berger measure of the embedding is related to the berger measure of w by the identity d r r 1 r d r r 0 1 it follows that the moments of and are related by the identity k 0 1 rk r 1 r d r 1 0 1 rk r 1 d r 1 rk i 0 1 i i rid r i 0 1 i i rk id r i 0 1 i i k i 3 8 if we now let the lebesgue measure on 0 1 we know by theorem 3 8 that is normalized arclength on the curve t s s 2 for 0 s 1 the moments of are k 0 1 rk 1 r dr b k 1 1 k 1 1 k 2 2 k k 2 1 where b and denote the classical beta and gamma functions respectively on the other hand 3 8 says that k i 0 1 i i k i i 0 1 i i 1 k i 1 and therefore i 0 1 i i 1 k 1 i k k 2 1 3 9 19 in particular lim i 0 1 i i 1 k 1 i 0 while 3 9 is known see for instance 23 vol 3 3 8 it is interesting that it can be obtained as a by product of a calculation of moments for the r r 1 r embedding the neil parabolic embedding the neil parabola np r 2 r 3 r 0 1 also known as the semicubical parabola has been studied in various contexts see for instance 26 and 27 here we will use it to produce a simple example which will lead to an answer to problem 1 5 first we recall that given a measure on x y the marginal measure x is given by x 1 x where x x y x is the canonical projection onto x thus x e e y for every e x cf subsection 7 4 example 3 10 let w be a subnormal unilateral weighted shift with berger measure let p r r 2 and q r r 3 and let f p q then the p q embedding pe f is subnormal with berger measure supported on np such that d r 2 r 3 d r furthermore w has the weight diagram shown in figure 2 ii by direct calculation one observes that the weight diagram for this embedding is intimately related to the weight diagram for the integer powers of w since w is subnormal let us denote by its berger measure we know that supp u u u r for s t np we then have d s t d s 1 2 t 1 3 moreover the last expression also represents the berger measure of w restricted to the reducing subspace h 2 3 0 0 see 4 6 in section 4 for the precise definition of this subspace 20 in the special case of w b we know that is lebesgue measure on 0 1 and therefore d r 2 r 3 dr by corollary 3 7 d x s d s 1 2 1 2 s ds and d y t d t 1 3 1 3 t 2 3 dt a simple calculation of moments reveals that this consistent with the information in figure 2 ii 4 application 1 the classical case k hyponormality in the class ce w a subnormal unilateral weighted shift in this section we consider the class of 2 variable weighted shifts obtained as classical embeddings of unilateral weighted shifts we ask whether a power of w can be jointly k hyponormal under the assumption that w is k hyponormal k 1 the following examples will answer this question first recall that for every positive integer m we have wm w m 0 w m 1 w m m 1 4 1 where the unilateral weighted shift w m i is associated with the sequence m i i k i k 1 i k m 1 k 0 for i 0 1 m 1 cf 11 if w is subnormal with berger measure then each summand w m i is subnormal 0 i m 1 let i be the berger measure for w m i 0 i m 1 in what follows we will need the following result theorem 4 1 11 theorem 2 9 d 0 r d r 1 m 21 and d i r ri 20 2 i 1 d r 1 m 1 i m 1 related to the decomposition 4 1 and theorem 4 1 we now prove theorem 4 2 let r be a nonnegative real number and 0 i m 1 i if r supp and r 6 0 then rm supp i 1 i m 1 ii if r supp i and r 6 0 then r 1 m supp 1 i m 1 iii 0 supp if and only if 0 supp 0 proof let bo r denote the borel algebra on r for n bo r we let n 1 m r 1 m r n and nm rm r n i since r supp there exists nr bo r such that r nr and nr 0 note that 0 n m r 0 nr 0 4 2 and i n m r 0 nr 0 4 3 since nmr bo r by the definition of nmr and 4 3 we must have rm supp i as desired ii since r supp i there exists nr bo r such that r nr and i nr 0 note that 0 nr 0 n 1 m r 0 4 4 and i nr 0 n 1 m r 0 4 5 since n 1 m r bo r by the definition of n 1 m r and 4 5 we must have r 1 m supp as desired 22 iii since d 0 r d r 1 m the equivalences 4 2 and 4 4 give the desired conclusion we now establish theorem 4 3 cf problem 1 4 ii let w be a subnormal unilateral weighted shift and let m be a positive integer assume thatwm is a direct sum of recursively generated weighted shifts then w is a recursively generated weighted shift proof this follows easily from theorem 4 2 and the fact that a subnormal unilateral weighted shift w is recursively generated if and only if its berger measure is finitely atomic that is card supp cf subsection 7 2 in the appendix by analogy with the decomposition used in 11 we now introduce a decomposition for a commuting 2 variable weighted shift w which will allow us to analyze its integer powers concretely we split the ambient space h 2 z 2 as an orthogonal direct sum h m 1 p 0 n 1 q 0 h m n p q where h m n p q e mi p nj q i 0 1 2 j 0 1 2 0 p m 1 0 q n 1 4 6 see figure 3 p q p m q p 2 m q p 3 m q p q n p q 2 n p q 3 n p 2 m q n figure 3 schematic diagram of the subspace h m n p q 23 we now let m e k 1 k 2 k 1 0 k 2 1 and n e k 1 k 2 k 1 1 k 2 0 each of the subspaces h m n p q reduces tm 1 and t n 2 and w m n is subnormal if and only if each w m n h m n p q is subnormal moreover each w m n h m n p q is a 2 variable weighted shift we now recall a simple criterion to detect the k hyponormality of 2 variable weighted shifts lemma 4 4 12 theorem 2 4 the following statements are equivalent i w is k hyponormal ii u 1 u 2 n m p q 0 n m k 0 p q k 0 for all u 1 u 2 z 2 example 4 5 consider w t 1 t 2 given by figure 4 ii that is k 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 for all k 1 k 2 0 assume that w shift 0 0 1 0 shift x 2 3 3 4 4 5 w is a rank one perturbation of b and it was previously studied in 5 then we have i w is hyponormal if and only if w is jointly hyponormal if and only if 0 x 23 0 667 ii w is 2 hyponormal if and only if w is jointly 2 hyponormal if and only if 0 x 9 16 0 563 iii w is 3 hyponormal if and only if w is jointly 3 hyponormal if and only if 0

hyponormal but w 2 3 is not jointly 2 hyponormal when 49 90 x 9 16 24 we establish i vi by direct calculations using 4 6 lemma 4 4 and mathematica 30 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 0 0 1 0 2 0 0 1 1 1 2 1 0 2 1 2 2

w x m n and w x m n 2 2 are not 2 hyponormal iv w x m n 3 3 and w x m n 4 4 are 2 hyponormal the statements i iv are established by direct calculations using 4 6 and lemma 4 4 we recall the following open question in 17 problem 1 1 let t be an operator and let k 2 does the k hyponormality of t imply the k hyponormality of t 2 25 remark 4 7 i consider the classical embedding w as in example 4 5 by lemma 3 3 we know that w is k hyponormal if and only if w is jointly k hyponormal more over we might expect that example 4 5 vi will provide some clues on the solution of the above mentioned open problem ii for p q 1 let mq e k 1 k 2 k 1 0 and k 2 q and np e k 1 k 2 k 1 p and k 2 0 the reader may have noticed that for the classical embedding w the restriction w x mq np is unitarily equivalent to the restriction w x mp q and also to the restriction w x np q this strengthens the role of the classical embedding as true one parametric representation of w inside a 2 variable weighted shift iii for a general operator t on hilbert space it is well known that the hyponormality of t does not imply the hyponormality of t 2 24 problem 209 however for a unilateral weighted shift w the hyponormality of w detected by the condition k k 1 for all k 0 clearly implies the hyponormality of every power wm m 1 for 2 variable weighted shifts one is thus tempted to expect that a similar result would hold especially if we restrict attention to the class of classical embeddings somewhat surprisingly it is actually possible to build a hyponormal 2 variable weighted shift w such that w 2 3 is not hyponormal as shown in example 4 6 i iv it is not hard to prove that the classical embedding of wm thought of as the orthogonal direct sum of the classical embeddings of each summand in 4 1 is unitarily equivalent to the power m 1 or 1 m of the classical embedding of w that is wm m 1 i 0 w m i w m 1 w 1 m thus when it comes to detecting the behavior of positive integer powers of a unilateral weighted shift to a great extent we can rely on the information provided by the powers 26 m 1 or 1 m of its classical embedding v consider the 2 variable weighted shift w w as in example 4 6 by iv above we observe that w m n and w m n 3 3 are both also classical embed dings by lemma 3 3 we know that w l 1 is k hyponormal if and only if w m 1 is jointly k hyponormal all k 1 where l 1 denotes the subspace of 2 z generated by the orthonormal basis vectors e 1 e 2 example 4 5 v provides a clear signal that it might be possible to find an operator t such that the 2 hyponormality of t 2 and t 3 does not imply the 2 hyponormality of t 5 application 2 the case of the bergman shift for an answer to problem 1 2 we recall k zhu s lemma for n 2 let sn resp bn be unit sphere resp ball in cn 1 we let dv denote the normalized volume measure on bn so that v bn 1 the normalized surface measure on sn will be denoted by d lemma 5 1 32 for n 2 let sn resp bn be unit sphere resp ball in cn 1 m m 1 m 2 mn zn and 1 let m m 1 m 2 mn m m 1 m 2 mn and be the gamma function then sn m 2 d n 1 m n 1 m 5 1 and bn zm 2 dv z m n 1 n m 1 where dv z c 1 z 2 dv z and c is the a normalizing constant so that v bn 1 and c n 1 n 1 theorem 5 2 cf problem 1 2 the berger measure of sie b is normalized arclength on the line segment l r 1 r 0 r 1 and sie b is unitarily equivalent to the commuting pair mz 1 mz 2 of multiplication operators on the hardy space of the unit sphere s 3 27 proof from figure 1 we easily see that k 1 k 2 sie b k 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 1 on the other hand these moments agree with those in 5 1 when n 2 it follows that the weight diagram in figure 1 corresponds to the commuting pair mz 1 mz 2 of multiplication operators on the hardy space of the unit sphere s 3 now recall from theorem 3 8 that the berger measure associated with the weight diagram in figure 1 is normalized arclength in the line segment l as a consequence we observe that sn m 2 d m m 1 0 1 rm 1 1 r m 2 dr an alternative calculation of the berger measure of the agler shifts we conclude this section with finding an alternative approach to the calculation of the berger measure of the agler j th shift aj j 2 for this we recall that each component ti of a subnormal 2 variable weighted shift w t 1 t 2 is subnormal for instance t 1 k 2 0 wk 2 resp t 2 k 1 0 vk 1 in this case we let k 2 k 2 0 and k 1 k 1 0 be the 1 variable berger measures for wk 2 k 2 0 and vk 1 k 1 0 respectively fix k 2 0 and observe that the moments of k 2 are given by 0 t 1 sk 1 d k 2 s 2 0 k 2 2 k 1 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 0 k 2 1 0 k 2 0 t 1 0 t 2 sk 1 tk 2 d s t all k 1 0 5 2 we also know that if is the berger measure of w then k 2 x k 2 where d k 2 s t 1 0 k 2 tk 2 d s t 16 theorem 3 1 recall now the drury arveson 2 variable weighted shift da whose weight sequences are given by 28 k 1 k 2 k 1 1 k 1 k 2 1 for all k 1 k 2 0 5 3 k 1 k 2 k 2 k 1 for all k 1 k 2 0 5 4 if we denote the successive rows of the weight diagram of da by r 0 r 1 r 2 it is easy to see that r 0 a 1 the unweighted unilateral shift r 1 a 2 b the bergman shift and more generally rk 2 1 ak 2 the agler k 2 th shift k 2 2 in particular all rows and columns are subnormal weighted shifts for k 2 2 it is well known that the berger measure of ak 2 is k 2 1 1 r k 2 2 dr on the closed interval 0 1 cf 8 paragraph immediately preceding theorem 1 1 however da is not subnormal not even hyponormal so we may not directly use the above argument on the other hand da is a close relative of the spherically isometric embedding sie a 2 of the bergman shift that is each row rj j 1 in da appears as row rj 1 in sie a 2 we thus obtain an alternative way to calculate the berger measure of the agler shifts corollary 5 3 for k 2 2 the berger measure of ak 2 is k 2 1 1 r k 2 2 dr on 0 1 0 1 0 2 t 1 t 2 0 0 1 0 2 0 0 1 2 0 c 2 1 c 2 0 1 c 2 2 c 2 1 c 20 c 21 c 2 0 c 2 1 c 2 0 c 2 1 c 2 2 c 2 1 i ii t 1 t 2 k k 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 k 2 k 3 k 3 k 4 k 1 k 3 k 2 k 4 k 3 k 5 k 1 k 2

figure 5 ii and figure 1 with w b since w is spherically quasinormal it is also subnormal let be the berger measure of w and let k 2 be the berger measure of ak 2 respectively recall that k 2 x k 2 2 where d k 2 s t 1 0 k 2 tk 2 d s t also for k 2 2 k 2 k 2 2 by theorem 1 6 figure 5 ii and figure 1 for all k 2 0 and s t g f r 1 r r 0 1 we can see that d k 2 s t 1 0 k 2 tk 2 d s t k 2 1 t k 2 d s t k 2 1 1 r k 2 d r 1 r thus we have d k 2 r d k 2 s t x k 2 1 1 r k 2 d r 1 r x k 2 1 1 r k 2 d r 5 5 where we have used corollary 3 7 to calculate the marginal measure therefore the berger measure of ak 2 is k 2 1 1 r k 2 2 dr on the closed interval 0 1 this completes the proof remark 5 4 i in the proof of corollary 5 3 we chose to calculate the berger measure of the agler shifts by using the rows of the spherically isometric embedding however since the weight diagram in figure 1 is symmetric with respect to the diagonal we could have chosen columns instead of rows to perform the calculation in that case one gets d k 1 r d k 1 s t y k 1 1 rk 1 d r 1 r y k 1 1 r k 1 d 1 r the substitution u 1 r shows that this answer is identical to that in 5 5 ii the reader may have noticed that our calculation of the berger measure of the agler shifts in corollary 5 3 is based on the theory of spherically isometric embeddings and the disintegration of measure techniques from 16 while this approach bypasses k zhu s result lemma 5 1 it does not provide a formula for the measure as we did in theorem 5 2 30 6 application 3 monomial pairs in this section we first present an alternative solution to problem 1 1 ii using the theory of recursively generated weighted shifts we then discuss two examples that illustrate the solution to problem 1 1 theorem 6 1 cf problem 1 1 ii let w 0 and be given as in problem 1 1 assume that w 0 is recursively generated with 0 s 0 r 1 sr 1 with 0 s 0 sr 1 c 0 r 1 0 and 0 r 1 1 then 0 s 0 c s 0 r 1 sr 1 c sr 1 proof sincew 0 shift 0 0 1 0 is a recursively generated weighted shift by lemma 7 1 there exists a generating function g 0 s such that the zeros of g 0 are the atoms of the berger measure of w 0 that is if we let g 0 s s r r 1 s r 1 r 2 s r 2 1 s 0 6 1 then g 0 s has r distinct real roots 0 s 0 s 1 sr 1 c since 2 k 1 k 2 2 k 1 k 2 c 0 for every k 1 k 2 z 2 we have k 1 1 k 2 w k 1 k 2 1 w c k 1 k 2 w it follows that we have a generating function h s t of w given by h s t s t c 6 2 thus the atoms of the berger measure for w are also zeros of h let be the berger measure of v 0 shift 0 0 0 1 0 2 by 20 corollary 5 6 supp c supp c s s supp 31 it follows that the atoms of must be of the form si c si 0 i r 1 we now denote the densities of by i so that 0 s 0 c s 0 r 1 sr 1 c sr 1 6 3 where 0 1 r 1 are positive real numbers which add up to 1 we thus have 0 1 r 1 0 0 1 0 s 0 1 s 1 r 1 sr 1 1 0 0 s 2 0 1 s 2 1 r 1 s 2 r 1 2 0 0 s r 1 0 1 s r 1 1 r 1 sr 1 r 1 r 1 0 6 4 observe that from 6 4 we obtain an invertible r r matrix v 1 1 1 s 0 s 1 sr 1 s 20 s 2 1 s 2 r 1 s 30 s 3 1 s 3 r 1 sr 10 s r 1 1 sr 1 r 1 r r then we have 0 r 1 v 1 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 r 1 0 1 r v 1 0 1 2 3 r 1 0 r 1 32 thus we have 0 s 0 c s 0 r 1 sr 1 c sr 1 6 5 therefore 6 5 provides an answer to problem 1 1 both i and ii example 6 2 consider a contractive spherically quasinormal 2 variable weighted shift w t 1 t 2 given by figure 5 i where w shift 0 1 is subnormal with berger measure 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 2 1 3 1 then w is subnormal with 3 atomic berger measure which is given by 1 3 13 2 3 1 3 12 1 2 1 3 1 0 where c 1 to see this note that v 1 1 1 s 0 s 1 s 2 s 20 s 2 1 s 2 2 1 1 1 1 3 1 2 1 1 9 1 4 1 and v 1 9 2 27 2 9 4 16 12 1 2 5 2 3 thus we have 0 1 2 9 2 27 2 9 4 16 12 1 2 5 2 3 1 11 18 49 36 1 3 1 3 1 3 as desired our last example shows how the berger measure of a spherically quasinormal embedding can sometimes be calculated by elementary methods bypassing theorem 1 8 example 6 3 consider the spherically quasinormal 2 variable weighted shift w t 1 t 2 given by figure 5 i where w shift 0 1 is subnormal with berger mea sure x a y b 1 x y 1 0 a b 1 0 x y 1 and x y 1 in figure 5 i assume that c 1 then w is subnormal with a three atomic berger measure 33 given by x a c a y b c b 1 x y 1 c 1 indeed it follows from 6 2 that w is subnormal with three atomic berger measure thus we have 0 a c a 1 b c b 1 0 1 1 c 1 6 6 and recall that 0 x y 1 and x y 1 since 0 a b 1 7 9 and 6 6 imply that lim k 1 k 1 0 w 1 0 1 lim k 1 k 1 w 1 x y 6 7 it follows readily that 0 1 x y 6 8 by 6 6 and 6 8 for all k 1 0 we have k 1 0 w k 1 w 0 x ak 1 1 y bk 1 0 if 0 x 6 0 then 0 lim k 1 a b k 1 y n m x n y which is a contradiction to 6 8 thus we must have 0 x and a fortiori 1 y it follows that x a c a y b c b 1 x y 1 c 1 6 9 as desired note in passing that the marginal measure x is 7 appendix 7 1 unilateral weighted shifts for n n 0 a bounded sequence of positive real numbers called weights let w shift 0 1 2 z 2 z be the associated

unilateral shift is u shift 1 1 1 and for 0 a 1 we let sa shift a 1 1 we now recall a well known characterization of subnormality for unilateral weighted shifts due to c berger cf 4 iii 8 16 and independently established by gellar and wallen 21 w is subnormal if and only if there exists a probability measure supported in 0 w 2 called the berger measure of w such that k w 2 0 2 k 1 tkd t k 1 observe that u and sa are subnormal with berger measures 1 and 1 a 2 0 a 2 1 respectively where p denotes the point mass probability measure with support the singleton set p on the other hand the berger measure of the bergman shift b acting on a 2 d and with weights n n 1 n 2 n 0 is the lebesgue measure on the interval 0 1 7 2 recursively generated unilateral weighted shifts we close this section with re calling some terminology and basic results from 9 and 10 a subnormal unilateral weighted shiftw is said to be recursively generated if the sequence of moments n admits a finite step recursive relation that is if there exists an integer k 1 and real coefficients 0 1 k 1 such that n k 0 n 1 n 1 k 1 n k 1 all n 0 7 2 in conjunction with 7 2 we consider the generating function g s s k 0 1 s k 1 sk 1 7 3 35 the following result characterizes recursively generated subnormal unilateral weighted shifts lemma 7 1 10 letw be a subnormal unilateral weighted shift the following statements are equivalent i w is recursively generated ii the berger measure of w is finitely atomic and g s i s si where supp s 0 sk 1 7 3 2 variable weighted shifts consider now two double indexed positive bounded se quences k k z 2 k k 1 k 2 z 2 and let 2 z 2 be the hilbert space of square summable complex sequences indexed by z 2 recall that 2 z 2 is canonically isometrically isomorphic to 2 z 2 z we define the 2 variable weighted shift w t 1 t 2 as a pair of operators given by t 1 ek kek 1 and t 2 ek kek 2 7 4 where 1 1 0 and 2 0 1 clearly t 1 t 2 t 2 t 1 k 1 k k 2 k all k z 2 7 5 moreover for k z 2 we have t 1 e 0 k 2 0 and t 1 ek k 1 ek 1 k 1 1 7 6 t 2 ek 1 0 0 and t 2 ek k 2 ek 2 k 2 1 7 7 in an entirely similar way one can define multivariable weighted shifts the weight diagram of a generic 2 variable weighted shift is shown in figure 4 i when all weights are equal to 1 we obtain the so called helton howe shift that is the shift that corresponds to the pair of multiplications by the coordinate functions in the hardy space 36 h 2 t t of the 2 torus with respect to normalized arclength measure on each unit circle t cf 22 this shift can also be represented as u i i u acting on 2 z 2 z we now recall the definition of moments for a commuting 2 variable weighted shift w given k k 1 k 2 z 2 the moment of w of order k is k k w 1 if k 1 0 and k 2 0 2 0 0 2 k 1 1 0 if k 1 1 and k 2 0 2 0 0 2 0 k 2 1 if k 1 0 and k 2 1 2 0 0 2 k 1 1 0 2 k 1 0 2 k 1 k 2 1 if k 1 1 and k 2 1 7 8 we remark that due to the commutativity condition 7 5 k can be computed using any nondecreasing path from 0 0 to k 1 k 2 to detect hyponormality there is a simple criterion theorem 7 2 6 six point test let w be a 2 variable weighted shift with weight sequences and then w is

tk 11 t k 2 2 d t 1 t 2 all k z 2 7 9 thus the study of subnormality for multivariable weighted shifts is intimately connected to multivariable real moment problems for more on 2 variable weighted shifts see 7 37 7 4 disintegration of measures the theory of disintegration of measures is well known and has been used in operator theory for more than forty years especially in the study of composition operators where the expectation operator has become a fundamental research tool most of the discussion in this subsection is taken from 4 vii 2 pp 317 319 16 and 31 let x and z be compact metric spaces and let be a positive regular borel measure on z and the space of all borel measures on z is denoted by m z for z x a borel mapping let be the borel measure 1 on x that is a 1 a for all borel sets a contained in x let 1 f f is borel function on z such that f d and let l 1 f f 1 where f g 1 f g d 0 the map z fd f l 1 defines a bounded linear functional on l if attention is restricted to characteristic functions a in l a z a fd 1 a fd is a countably additive measure defined on borel sets in x that is absolutely continuous with respect to hence there is a unique element e f in l 1 such that z a fd x ae f d for all borel subsets a of x by an approximation argument one can show that z fd x e f d for all in l this defines a map e 1 l 1 38 called the expectation operator definition 7 3 a disintegration of the measure with respect to is a function t 7 t from x to m z such that i for each t in x t is a probability measure ii if f 1 e f t z fd t a e in the sequel we always assume that x and y are compact metric spaces in case reference is made to weighted shifts we assume that x y r definition 7 4 given a measure on x y the marginal measure x is given by x 1 x where x x y x is the canonical projection onto x thus x e e y for every e x observe that if is a probability measure then so is x then we have theorem 7 5 31 let and t be as in definition 7 3 define y g x g all g y
