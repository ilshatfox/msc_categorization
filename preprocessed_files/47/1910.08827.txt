variable weighted shiftw and its powersw 2 1 andw 1 2 are all spherically quasinormal then w may not necessarily be jointly quasinormal moreover it is possible for both w 2 1 and w 1 2 to be spherically quasinormal withoutw being spherically quasinormal finally we prove that for 2 variable weighted shifts the common fixed points of the toral and spherical aluthge transforms are jointly

a 20 1 introduction let h be a complex hilbert space and let b h denote the algebra of bounded linear operators on h an operator t b h is said to be normal if t t tt quasinormal if t commutes with t t i e tt t t t 2 subnormal if t n h where n is normal and n h h and hyponormal if t t tt it is well known that normal quasinormal subnormal hyponormal for s t b h let s t st ts we say that an n tuple t t 1 tn of operators on h is jointly hyponormal if the operator matrix t t t 1 t 1 t 2 t 1 t n t 1 t 1 t 2 t 2 t 2 t n t 2 t 1 tn t 2 tn t n tn is positive on the direct sum of n copies of h cf 3 11 18 the n tuple t is said to be normal if t is commuting and each ti is normal and subnormal if t is the restriction of a normal n tuple to a common invariant subspace for i j k 1 2 n t is called matricially quasinormal if each ti commutes with each t j tk t is jointly quasinormal if each ti commutes with each t j tj and spherically quasinormal if each ti commutes with n j 1 t j tj as shown in 5 and 29 we have normal matricially quasinormal jointly quasinormal spherically quasinormal subnormal 1 1 on the other hand the results in 23 and 29 show that the inverse implications in 1 1 do not hold it is well known that the only quasinormal 1 variable weighted shift is up to a constant multiple the unweighted unilateral shift u shift 1 1 one of the aims of this paper is to show that there is a clear distinction between quasi normality in the single operator case and spherical quasinormality for commuting 2 pairs of operators to describe our results we first need to introduce some no tation and terminology first we consider the polar decomposition and aluthge transforms for commuting pairs t t 1 t 2 the reader will notice at once that results for pairs can be readily generalized to the case of commuting n tuples of operators for t b h the canonical polar decomposition of t is t v t with ker v ker t and the aluthge transform t of t is t t 12 u t 12 the aluthge transform was first introduced in 1 and it has attracted considerable attention over the last two decades see for instance 2 7 25 33 34 35 and 40 roughly speaking the idea behind the aluthge transform is to convert an operator into another operator which shares with the first one many spectral properties but which is closer to being a normal operator for t 1 t 2 b h consider the pair t t 1 t 2 as an operator from h into h h that is t t 1 t 2 h h h 1 2 then we have t t t 1 t 2 t 1 t 2 t 1 t 1 t 2 t 2 so that we can define a polar decomposition of t t 1 t 2 as follows t t 1 t 2 v 1 v 2 p v 1 p v 2 p 1 3 where p t 1 t 1 t 2 t 2 we then have r v 1 v 2 v 1 v 2 i on kert ker t 1 kert 2 kerp ker v 1 v 2 ker v 1 kerv 2 for t t 1 t 2 it is now natural to define the spherical aluthge transform of t as t t 1 t 2 pv 1 p pv 2 p cf 22 23 32 1 4 for a commuting pair of operators t t 1 t 2 we can also define the toral aluthge transform by taking aluthge transforms coordinate wise t t 1 t 2 t 1 t 2 t 1 1 2 u 1 t 1 1 2 t 2 1 2 u 2 t 2 1 2 cf 22 23 32 3 next we recall the class of unilateral weighted shifts for n n 0 a bounded sequence of positive real numbers called weights let w shift 0 1 2 z 2 z be the associated unilateral weighted shift defined by w en nen 1 all n 0 where en n 0 is the canonical orthonormal basis in 2 z the moments of n n 0 are given as k k w 1 if k 0 20 2 k 1 if k 0 similarly consider double indexed positive bounded sequences k k z 2 k k 1 k 2 z 2 and let 2 z 2 be the hilbert space of square summable complex sequences indexed by z 2 recall that 2 z 2 is canonically isomet rically isomorphic to 2 z 2 z we define the 2 variable weighted shift w t 1 t 2 by t 1 ek kek 1 t 2 ek kek 2 where 1 1 0 and 2 0 1 clearly t 1 t 2 t 2 t 1 k 1 k k 2 k all k z 2 1 5 from now on we will consider only commuting 2 variable weighted shifts for basic properties for 2 variable weighted shift w we refer to 16 and 20 given k k 1 k 2 z 2 the moments of of order k are k k w 1 if k 1 0 and k 2 0 2 0 0 2 k 1 1 0 if k 1 1 and k 2 0 2 0 0 2 0 k 2 1 if k 1 0 and k 2 1 2 0 0 2 k 1 1 0 2 k 1 0 2 k 1 k 2 1 if k 1 1 and k 2 1 1 6 we remark that due to the commutativity condition 1 5 k can be computed using any nondecreasing path from 0 0 to k 1 k 2 we now recall a well known characterization of subnormality for multivariable weighted shifts 31 due to c berger cf 8 iii 8 16 and independently established by r gellar and l j wallen 28 in the single variable case w admits a commuting normal ex tension if and only if there is a probability measure which we call the berger 4 measure of w defined on the 2 dimensional rectangle r 0 a 1 0 a 2 where ai ti 2 such that k w r sk 1 tk 2 d s t for all k z 2 called berger s theorem 1 7 for 0 a 1 we let sa shift a 1 1 observe that u and sa are subnormal with berger measures 1 and 1 a 2 0 a 2 1 respectively where p denotes the point mass probability measure with support in the singleton set p we denote the class of subnormal pairs by h and the class of commuting pairs of subnormal operators by h 0 clearly h h 0 motivated in part by the results 16 and 17 we now study some properties of matricially jointly and spherically quasinormal pairs of commuting operators including the following questions problem 1 1 let t be a subnormal operator and assume that t 2 is quasinormal does it follow that t is quasinormal problem 1 2 i let t t 1 t 2 h 0 be spherically quasinormal and let m and n be two positive integers is t m n tm 1 t n 2 spherically quasinormal ii if t and t 1 2 t 1 t 22 are both spherically quasinormal is t jointly quasinormal iii if t 2 1 t 21 t 2 and t 1 2 t 1 t 22 are both spherically quasinormal is t spherically quasinormal problem 1 3 let t h 0 and assume that t t t is t jointly quasi normal a subnormal operator is said to be pure if it has no nonzero normal orthogonal summands that is if there exists no nonzero subspace m of h invariant under t such that t m is normal where t m denotes the restriction of t to m since quasinormal operators are always subnormal it makes sense to speak of pure quasinormal operators in 1953 a brown obtained a characterization of pure quasinormal operators in terms of a tensor product of a unilateral shift u of finite or infinite multiplicity and a positive operator a concretely his result states that every pure quasinormal operator t b h is unitarily equivalent to u a acting on 2 z r where a 0 with kera 0 of course u u ir so that the multiplicity of u is dimr 6 8 theorem 3 2 cf lemma 4 8 hence it is natural to ask 5 problem 1 4 let t t 1 t 2 be a commuting pair of operators assume that t is spherically quasinormal and that t is pure i e no nonzero normal orthogonal summands do there exist a joint isometry u u 1 u 2 and a positive operator p 0 such that t is unitarily equivalent to u p in theorem 2 12 we will obtain a characterization of quasinormality for sub normal n tuples which we believe is the right multivariable analogue of the key step in brown s proof in the 1 variable case we conclude this section by recording a result proved in 24 proposition 1 5 24 theorem 2 2 for t t 1 t 2 h 0 the following are equivalent i t is spherically quasinormal ii t t 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 0 0 1 0 2 0 0 1 1 1 2 1 0 2 1 2 2 2 t 1 t 2 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 0 0 1 0 2 1 0 1 1 1 2 2 0 2 1 2 2 i ii t 1 t 2 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 2 3 5 6 14 15 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1

pairs with spherically quasinormal powers we first turn our attention to powers of quasinormal operators for t b h it is well known that the hyponormality of t does not imply the hyponormality of t 2 30 however for a unilateral weighted shift w the hyponormality of w 6 detected by the condition k k 1 for all k 0 clearly implies the hyponor mality of every power wm m 1 it is also well known that the subnormality of t implies the subnormality of tm m 2 the converse implication how ever is false in fact the subnormality of all powers tm m 2 does not necessarily imply the subnormality of t even if t w is a unilateral weighted shift e g for 0 a b 1 the square of shift a b 1 1 is subnormal 30 31 36 38 lemma 4 8 says that if t b h is pure quasinormal then t u t u a acting on 2 z r where a 0 with kera 0 u u ir and t i 2 z a hence for m 1 tm um am and t m u m am 2 1 so that t m tm i a 2 m 2 2 therefore the commutator tm t m tm is equal to 0 that is tm is quasinormal for all m 1 in view of this it is natural to ask if t 2 is pure quasinormal is t pure quasinormal without a restriction on t it is easy to answer this question in the negative for let t be a nonzero nilpotent operator of order two that is t 2 0 then t 2 is quasinormal but t is not quasinormal of course such an operator cannot be subnormal let us assume then that t is subnormal the following problem is a refinement of problem 1 1 problem 2 1 let t be subnormal and assume that t 2 is pure quasinormal is it true that t is pure quasinormal we now provide an almost complete answer to problem 2 1 first we need an auxiliary lemma of independent interest it is similar in spirit to 8 lemma 3 1 lemma 2 2 let t be a subnormal operator on h with normal extension n acting on k h and write n t a 0 b then t is quasinormal if and only if a t 0 proof we calculate nn n tt t aa t tt a a a a bb b a t b a a bb 7 and n nn t tt t ta t ab a tt a ta a a bb b since nn n nn n we have tt t aa t t tt then the commutator of t and t t is t t t aa t it follows that t is quasinormal if and only if aa t 0 if and only if rant keraa kera if and only if a t 0 this completes the proof theorem 2 4 let t b h be subnormal and assume that t 2 is quasinormal if t is bounded below i e left invertible then t is quasinormal proof since t b h is subnormal we consider a normal extension n of t such that n t a 0 b assume that t 2 is quasinormal and consider the matricial representation of n 2 that is n 2 t 2 ta ab 0 b 2 from lemma 2 2 we know that t 2 is quasinormal if and only if ta ab t 2 0 if and only if a t t 2 ba t 2 0 recall that n n nn i e t t tt aa a t b a a a bb b b we thus have a t tt a tt aa t a tt t a aa t and ba tt b a t t bb a t since we are assuming that t 2 is quasinormal the previous calculation reveals that 0 a t t 2 ba t 2 a tt t a aa t bb a t a tt t a a bb a t a t t t b b a t rt t lb b a t 8 where rx and lx denote the right and left multiplication operators by x acting on b h it follows that a t ker rt t lb b however by the spectral mapping theorem for the left spectrum 10 we have rt t lb b rt t lb b if 0 rt t lb b then 0 for some rt t lb b but rt t lb b r t t b b r r 12 13 thus if 0 rt t lb b then 0 with r it follows that 0 this implies that 0 r t t and 0 b b and therefore 0 t t and 0 b b therefore we have 0 t b that is neither t nor b is bounded below it follows that under the assumption that t is bounded below the operator rt t lb b is injective and then a t 0 as desired corollary 2 6 let t b h be subnormal and t 2 be pure quasinormal if t is bounded below then t is pure quasinormal proof quasinormality is clear from theorem 2 4 if t is not pure then there is a nonzero reducing subspace m of h such such that t m is normal where t m denotes the restriction of t to m since t 2 m is also normal t 2 is not pure which is a contradiction therefore t is pure remark 2 8 as described in lemma 4 8 a pure quasinormal operator t is up to unitary equivalence of the form t u a where a 0 acts on r then t 2 u 2 a 2 it follows from corollary 2 6 that a bounded below subnormal operator t whose square is pure quasinormal must be of the form u a where dimr is either infinite or finite and even the multivariable analogues of theorem 2 4 are highly nontrivial thus at present problem 1 4 is rather challenging we now present a multivariable analogue of a key step in brown s character ization of quasinormality within the class of subnormal operators we believe theorem 2 12 below can be used to solve problem 1 4 although we present our results for commuting pairs of operators the reader will easily see that the same statements work well for commuting n tuples of operators when n 2 let t t 1 t 2 be a commuting subnormal pair of operators on a hilbert space h and let n n 1 n 2 be a normal extension of t acting on k h for i 1 2 write ni ti ai 0 b i 2 3 9 then n 1 n 1 n 2 n 2 t 1 t 1 t 2 t 2 t 1 a 1 t 2 a 2 a 1 t 1 a 2 t 2 a 1 a 1 b 1 b 1 a 2 a 2 b 2 b 2 2 4 as usual let p t 1 t 1 t 2 t 2 remark 2 9 from lemma 2 2 we know that if t 1 and t 2 are quasinormal then a 1 t 1 a 2 t 2 0 for i 1 2 it follows that 0 ni n 1 n 1 n 2 n 2 n 1 n 1 n 2 n 2 ni 2 5 ti ai 0 b i p 2 0 0 p 2 0 0 ti ai 0 b i 2 6 tip 2 p 2 ti 0 2 7 it follows that t 1 t 2 is spherically quasinormal in short if t is subnormal and each of t 1 and t 2 is quasinormal then t is spherically quasinormal corollary 2 10 let t be subnormal and assume that ti is bounded below and t 2 i is quasinormal i 1 2 then t is spherically quasinormal proof straightforward from theorem 2 4 and remark 2 9 theorem 2 12 let t be subnormal with normal extension n then t is spher ically quasinormal if and only if a 1 t 1 a 2 t 2 0 proof using 2 4 and the calculation in remark 2 9 and looking at the 1 1 entry of ni n 1 n 1 n 2 n 2 n 1 n 1 n 2 n 2 ni i 1 2 it is clear that ti p 2 ai a 1 t 1 a 2 t 2 it follows that t 1 t 2 is spherically quasinormal if and only if ai a 1 t 1 a 2 t 2 0 for i 1 2 consider now the equation a 1 a 2 a 1 a 2 t 1 t 2 0 0 2 8 since kerzz kerz for all operators z we see that 2 8 is equivalent to a 1 a 2 t 1 t 2 0 0 and this is equivalent to a 1 t 1 a 2 t 2 0 as desired 10 we now consider the case of joint quasinormality for a subnormal pair and how the normal extension detects it recall that a commuting pair t is jointly quasinormal if ti commutes with t j tj for all i j 1 2 also recall the fuglede putnam theorem 9 12 5 if n and m are normal operators and t is an operator such that nt tm then n t tm theorem 2 14 let t t 1 t 2 be a subnormal pair with normal extension n then t is jointly quasinormal if and only if a i tj 0 i j 1 2 proof as in 2 3 write n 1 n 2 t 1 a 1 0 b 1 t 2 a 2 0 b 2 for i j 1 2 ninj njni and ni is normal by the fuglede putnam theorem we have nin j n j ni 2 9 for i j k 1 2 we calculate nin j nk tit j tk aia jtk tit j ak ai a jak bjb k b i a jtk b i a jak bjb k and n j nkni t j tkti t j tkai t j akb i a jtkti a jtkai a jak bjb k b i since nin j nk n j nkni i j k 1 2 we have tit j tk aia jtk t j tkti i j k 1 2 2 10 observe that for i j we have ti t i tk aia i tk if t t 1 t 2 is jointly quasinormal then by 2 10 ti t i tk aia i tk 0 i k 1 2 it follows that a itk 0 i k 1 2 as desired this is clear from 2 10 recall now that a commuting pair t is matricially quasinormal if ti commutes with t j tk for all i j k 1 2 corollary 2 16 let t t 1 t 2 be a subnormal pair with normal extension n then t is matricially quasinormal if and only if aia jtk 0 i j k 1 2 proof straightforward from the proof of theorem 2 14 and the definition of matricial quasinormality 11 3 powers of spherically quasinormal 2 variable weighted shifts in this section we focus on the class of 2 variable weighted shifts we mainly study spherical quasinormality a notion that is emerging in the multivariable context as the most appropriate generalization of the classical notion of quasi normality for single operators we start with two simple results which help to validate the previous comment we first observe that there is no matricially quasinormal 2 variable weighted shift next we prove that the only jointly quasinormal 2 variable weighted shift is up to a constant multiple the helton howe shift that is the shift of the form i u u i with berger measure 1 1 we say that two commuting pairs s 1 s 2 and t 1 t 2 differ by a con stant multiple if si riti for some r 1 r 2 0 to this end we need the following result which was announced in 22 and established in 23 cf 24 theorem 3 1 for a 2 variable weighted shift w t 1 t 2 the following statements are equivalent i w t 1 t 2 h 0 is a spherically quasinormal 2 variable weighted shift ii t 1 t 1 t 2 t 2 c i for some positive constant c iii for all k k 1 k 2 z 2 2 k 1 k 2 2 k 1 k 2 c for some positive constant c 0 iv for all k k 1 k 2 z 2 k 1 k 2 c k for some positive constant c 0 remark 3 2 a commuting pair t 1 t 2 is said to be a spherical isometry if t 1 t 1 t 2 t 2 i it is well known that spherical isometries are subnormal 4 26 theorem 3 1 asserts that every spherically quasinormal 2 variable weighted shift is up to a constant multiple a spherical isometry let us consider now matricial quasinormality for 2 variable weighted shifts since t 1 must commute with t 1 t 2 it follows easily that t 1 must be normal when restricted to rant 2 in particular the restriction of t 1 to each row with index k 2 bigger than zero will be normal this contradicts the fact that there are no normal unilateral weighted shifts therefore there are no matricially quasinormal 2 variable weighted shifts next we examine joint quasinormality let us assume that w t 1 t 2 h 0 is jointly quasinormal i e ti commutes with t j tj for i j 1 2 thus for all k 1 k 2 z 2 we obtain that t 1 t 2 t 2 e k 1 k 2 t 2 t 2 t 1 e k 1 k 2 2 k 1 k 2 t 1 e k 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 k 1 1 k 2 t 2 e k 1 1 k 2 1 2 k 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 2 k 1 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 k 1 1 k 2 3 1 12 and t 2 t 1 t 1 e k 1 k 2 t 1 t 1 t 2 e k 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 1 3 2 recall now that jointly quasinormal pairs are always spherically quasinormal and apply theorem 3 1 to 3 1 and 3 2 we see that k 1 k 2 k 1 1 k 2 and k 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 1 3 3 since joint quasinormality implies spherical quasinormality by 3 1 and 3 2 we have 2 k 1 k 2 2 k 1 k 2 2 k 1 1 k 2 2 k 1 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 k 1 1 k 2 3 4 and 2 k 1 k 2 2 k 1 k 2 2 k 1 k 2 1 2 k 1 k 2 1 k 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 1 3 5 letw k 2 resp w k 1 denote the unilateral weighted shift of the associated with the k 2 th horizontal row resp k 1 th vertical column in the weighted diagram of w t 1 t 2 condition 3 4 implies that w k 2 shift 0 k 2 1 k 2 0 k 2 u 3 6 similarly condition 3 5 implies that w k 1 shift k 1 0 k 1 10 k 1 0 u 3 7 thus by 3 6 and 3 7 we obtain that up to a constant multiple the only jointly quasinormal 2 variable weighted shift is i u u i we summarize the previous analysis in the following result theorem 3 3 up to a constant multiple the only jointly quasinormal 2 variable weighted shift is the helton howe shift i u u i we now discuss four key questions in the study of spherical quasinormality the following two problems are suitable restatements of problems 1 2 and 1 3 respectively problem 3 4 i let t t 1 t 2 h 0 be spherically quasinormal does it follow that t m n tm 1 t n 2 is spherically quasinormal ii let t be spherically quasinormal and assume that t 1 2 t 21 t 2 is also spherically quasinormal does it follow that t is jointly quasinormal iii let t t 1 t 2 h 0 and assume that both t 2 1 t 21 t 12 and t 1 2 t 1 t 2 2 are spherically quasinormal does it follow that t is spherically quasi normal 13 problem 3 5 let t h 0 and assume that t t t does it follow that t is jointly quasinormal we first address problem 3 4 i the following example shows that there exists a spherically quasinormal 2 variable weighted shift w such that w 2 1 is not spherically quasinormal motivated by the ideas in 19 we split the ambient space 2 z 2 into an orthogonal direct sum m 1 p 0 n 1 q 0 h m n p q where h m n p q e m p nk q k 0 1 2 0 1 2 let w m n h m n p q be the restriction of w m n to the space h m n p q each of h m n p q reduces tm 1 and t n 2 and w m n is subnormal if and only if each w m n h m n p q is subnormal we let m n k 1 k 2 h m n p q and m n k 1 k 2 h m n p q be the weights ofw m n h m n p q example 3 6 consider w given by figure 1 ii then w is spherically quasinormal indeed a spherical isometry but w 2 1 is not spherically quasi normal to establish this we will apply the results in theorem 3 1 suppose that w 2 1 is spherically quasinormal then w 2 1 h 2 1 0 0 and w 2 1 h 2 1 1 0 are both spherically quasinormal so that by theorem 3 1 we have that 2 1 k 1 k 2 h 2 1 p 0 2 1 k 1 k 2 h 2 1 p 0 is constant for all k 1 k 2 z 2 and p 0 1 consider w 2 1 h 2 1 0 0 and 2 1 k 1 0 h 2 1 0 0 2 1 k 1 0 h 2 1 0 0 for k 1 0 1 observe that 2 1 0 0 h 2 1 0 0 2 1 0 0 h 2 1 0 0 8 9 6 44 45 2 1 1 0 h 2 1 0 0 2 1 1 0 h 2 1 0 0 by theorem 3 1 w 2 1 h 2 1 0 0 is not spherically quasinormal and as a result w 2 1 is not spherically quasinormal as desired to proceed we recall some basic results from the theory of truncated moment problems for more on truncated moment problems we refer to 14 and 15 given real numbers 2 n 00 01 10 02 11 20 02 n 2 n 0 with 00 0 the truncated real moment problem for entails finding conditions for the existence of a positive borel measure supported in r 2 such that ij yixjd x y 0 i j n 14 given 2 n we can build an associated moment matrix m n m n m i j ni j 0 where m i j 0 i j 1 i j 1 j i 1 i j 1 2 i j 2 j 1 i 1 i j i 1 j 1 i j 0 3 8 we denote the successive rows and columns of m n by 1 x y x 2 xy y 2 xn y n 3 9 observe that each block m i j is of hankel form i e constant in cross diagonals we now provide a characterization of a class of 2 variable weighted shifts w t 1 t 2 which are spherically quasinormal and have power t 21 t 2 also spherically quasinormal this answers problem 3 4 ii in the negative while identifying the key obstruction namely the condition 0 0 1 theorem 3 7 let w t 1 t 2 be spherically quasinormal and assume that w 2 1 t 21 t 2 is also spherically quasinormal assume also that 3 0 1 then up to a scalar multiple either w is the helton howe shift or the berger measure of w is 2 atomic of the form 1 x 0 0 1 q x 0 1 q where x 0 2 0 0 and q 2 1 0 in this case the restriction of t 1 t 2 to the invariant subspace n is up to a constant multiple the helton howe shift here n denotes the subspace of 2 z 2 generated by all canonical orthonormal basis vectors e k 1 k 2 with k 1 1 proof let x 1 2 1 0 x 2 2 2 0 x 3 2 3 0 p 2 0 0 r 2 2 0 and s 2 3 0 by assumption x 3 1 since both w and w 2 1 are spherically quasinormal theorem 3 1 readily implies that x 0 p x 1 q x 2 r 1 s and x 0 x 1 p x 2 r 3 10 then x 0 x 1 p x 0 p x 0 x 1 1 0 x 1 1 3 11 since w is subnormal and therefore hyponormal we must have 0 x 0 x 1 x 2 x 3 and it therefore follows that x 1 x 2 x 3 1 since w 15 t 1 t 2 is spherically quasinormal it is also subnormal by lemma 4 6 so that t 1 and t 2 are both subnormal operators since t 1 is subnormal each horizontal row is a subnormal unilateral weighted shift for these shifts it is well known that the presence of two equal weights readily implies that the shift is of the form shift 0 1 1 1 with 0 1 38 it follows that shift 0 0 1 0 s 0 0 shift 0 0 1 1 with berger measures 1 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 1 since w is spherically quasinor mal theorem 3 1 and the commutativity of t 1 and t 2 imply that shift 1 k 2 2 k 2 u and shift k 1 1 k 1 2 q u for all k 1 1 and k 2 0 this immediately leads to the following column relations in the moment matrix of w x 2 x xy qx x y 1 q 1 3 12 let us focus now on the 6 6 moment matrix m 2 since m 2 is positive and recursively generated we can formally multiply the third column relation in 3 12 by y to obtain xy y 2 1 q y and therefore y 2 1 q y qx thus the columns y x 2 xy and y 2 are all linear combinations of the columns 1 and x it follows that m 2 is a flat extension of m 1 and there exists a unique representing measure with card supp rankm 1 where card denotes cardinality the measure is actually the berger measure of t 1 t 2 if rankm 1 1 then x x 0 1 and y p 1 so that x 0 1 and p q we can then easily show that up to a constant multiple t 1 t 2 is the helton howe shift if instead rankm 1 2 then x 0 1 and therefore p q because x 0 p 1 q by the last equation in 3 12 also supp is the algebraic variety consisting of the intersection of the zero sets of the polynomials associated with the column relations in 3 12 the equations to solve simultaneously are x 2 x xy qx x y 1 q 3 13 it follows that supp 0 1 q 1 q a simple calculation now reveals that the densities of associated to these two atoms are 1 x 0 and x 0 resp the proof is complete 16 corollary 3 9 let w t 1 t 2 be spherically quasinormal and assume that w 2 1 t 21 t 2 and w 1 2 t 1 t 22 are also spherically quasinormal then up to a scalar multiple w is the helton howe shift and therefore w is jointly quasinormal proof we will continue to use the notation from theorem 3 7 for the weights and we will also let b 2 0 1 assume that w is not the helton howe shift by theorem 3 7 we know that the berger measure of w is 2 atomic with atoms at 0 1 q and 1 q since t 1 t 2 2 is spherically quasinormal we must have pb x 0 q 2 1 now recall that pb 2 0 1 2 0 0 02 y 2 d 1 x 0 1 q 2 x 0 q 2 it follows that 1 x 0 1 q 2 x 0 q 2 x 0 q 2 1 which is equivalent to 2 q 1 x 0 0 since q 6 0 and x 0 1 we obtain a contradiction the proof is complete we now address problem 3 4 iii for this we consider a subnormal 2 variable weighted shift t 1 t 2 with 2 atomic berger measure written as s t u v where s t u v 0 s u t 6 v 0 and 1 we seek concrete necessary and sufficient conditions for the spherical quasinormality of t 1 t 2 t 2 1 t 2 and t 1 t 2 2 in terms of s t u v and lemma 3 11 let t 1 t 2 and be as above and recall that t 1 t 2 is spherically quasinormal if and only if k 1 k 2 c k 3 14 for some constant c 0 and all k z 2 theorem 3 1 then t 1 t 2 is spheri cally quasinormal if and only if s t u v 17 proof in view of 3 14 to verify spherical quasinormality we must ensure that f k k 1 k 2 k is constant for all k z 2 this requires two tests i f k 1 f k and ii f k 2 f k a straightforward calculation using mathematica 39 reveals that f satisfies i if and only if f satisfies ii if and only if sk 1 tk 2 uk 1 vk 2 t v s t u v 0 it follows that t 1 t 2 is spherically quasinormal if and only if s t u v as desired in a completely similar way we establish the following result once again re sorting to mathematica lemma 3 13 let t 1 t 2 and be as above then t 2 1 t 2 is spherically quasi normal if and only if s 2 t u 2 v lemma 3 14 let t 1 t 2 and be as above then t 2 1 t 2 is spherically quasi normal if and only if s t 2 u v 2 remark 3 15 i observe that the conditions in lemmas 3 11 3 13 and 3 14 do not involve the densities or thus spherical quasinormality for these 2 variable weighted shifts depends only on the supp ii observe that if the pairs s t and u v satisfy simultaneously the equations in lemmas 3 11 3 13 and 3 14 then one must have s t u v s 2 t u 2 v and s t 2 u v 2 by simple algebraic manipulations see the proof of theorem 3 16 below and keeping in mind that s u one easily obtains that t 1 s u 1 s and v s it follows that any choice of s in the interval 0 1 2 and any choice of produces an example of a 2 variable weighted shift with 2 atomic berger measure and such that t 1 t 2 t 2 1 t 2 and t 1 t 2 2 are each spherically quasinormal notice that this does not contradict theorem 3 7 since here we do not assume that 3 0 1 18 we are now ready to give an answer to problem 3 4 iii theorem 3 16 there exists a subnormal 2 variable weighted shift t 1 t 2 with 2 atomic berger measure such that i t 21 t 2 is spherically quasinormal ii t 1 t 2 2 is spherically quasinormal and iii t 1 t 2 is not spherically quasinormal proof by lemmas 3 11 3 13 and 3 14 it suffices to find a nonnegative real numbers s t u v such that s u t 6 v s 2 t u 2 v 3 15 s t 2 u v 2 3 16 and s u 6 t v 3 17 it is easy to see that 3 15 implies that v s 2 t u 2 when this value is inserted into 3 16 one gets t 1 s 3 s 2 u su 2 u 3 2 s u as a result 3 17 becomes u s s u 1 6 0 thus to complete the proof all we need is to choose s and u such that s u 6 1 we next consider problem 1 3 for this we consider a class ats of commuting 2 variable weighted shifts w for which the toral and spherical aluthge trans forms agree that is w w cf 22 23 using lemmas 4 1 and 4 4 it suffices to restrict attention to the equalities k k 1 k 2 k 1 2 k 1 1 4 2 k 2 k 1 4 and k k 2 k 2 k 2 2 k 2 1 4 2 k 2 k 1 4 for all k z 2 thus we easily see that w w if and only if 2 k 1 2 k 2 k 2 k 2 k 1 2 k 1 and 2 k 2 2 k 2 k 2 k 2 k 2 2 k 2 19 for all k z 2 which is equivalent to k 1 k k k 1 and k 2 k k k 2 for all k z 2 if we now recall condition 1 5 for the commutativity of w that is k k 1 k k 2 for all k z 2 we see at once that w w if and only if k 1 k 2 and k 2 k 1 for all k z 2 it follows that the weight diagram for w is completely determined by the 0 th row and the weight 0 0 see figure 2 ii 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 x 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 t 1 t 2 0 1 0 2 0 3 xq q q q q q q q q i ii t 1 t 2 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 0

2 variable weighted shift in theorem 3 18 respectively next we give an answer to problem 3 5 theorem 3 18 if w w w then w is jointly quasinor mal proof since w w the weight diagram of w must be of the form shown in figure 2 ii since w w we note that for k 1 0 k 1 0 k 1 1 0 k 1 0 k 1 0 k 1 1 0 3 18 by theorem 3 1 we also have that for k 1 0 k 1 0 k 1 1 0 3 19 20 by the condition 1 5 for the commutativity of w we have that for k 1 0 k 1 1 k 1 1 1 3 20 by theorem 3 1 again we have that for k 1 0 k 1 1 k 1 1 1 3 21 since w t 1 t 2 is spherically quasinormal it is subnormal so that t 1 and t 2 are both subnormal by 3 19 we have 0 0 1 0 also from figure 2 ii we have 1 0 0 1 and as a result 0 0 0 1 since t 2 is subnormal it follows that 0 0 0 k 2 for all k 2 1 it is now straightforward that 0 0 k 1 k 2 for all k 1 k 2 0 similarly 0 0 k 1 k 2 for all k 1 k 2 0 it follows that w i 0 0 u 0 0 u i therefore by theorem 3 3 w is jointly quasinormal as desired 4 appendix for the reader s
