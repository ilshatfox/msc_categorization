denote by a 1 a 2 the linear space a 1 a 2 with the tensor norm and by a 1 a 2 a completion of a 1 a 2 so we can easily prove the following injections a 1 a 2 a 1 a 2 a 1 a 2 that property can be extended to the tensor product a 1 a 2 am m e l c s m n m 3 3 6 hilbertian schwartz kernel of a tensor product let ej j j 1 2 two hilbert spaces on k and e e 1 e 2 from the above paragraph we can deduce that e e 1 e 2 moreover if ej j hilb aj j 1 2 then e hilb a 1 a 2 thus if ej is the schwartz kernel of ej j j 1 2 then the kernel of e is equal to e 1 e 2 and a k b k a k k 1 2 e 1 e 2 a 1 a 2
