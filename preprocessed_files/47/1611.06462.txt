an interplay between function theory and operator theory we first establish a criterion on the coprime ness of two singular inner functions and obtain several properties of the douglas shapiro shields factorizations of matrix functions of bounded type we propose a new notion of tensored scalar singularity and then answer questions on hankel operators with matrix valued bounded type symbols we also examine an interpolation problem related to a certain functional equation on matrix functions of bounded type this can be seen as an extension of the classical hermite feje r interpolation problem for matrix rational functions we then extend the h functional calculus to an h h functional calculus for the compressions of the shift next we consider the subnormality of toeplitz operators with matrix valued bounded type symbols and in particular the matrix valued version of halmos s problem 5 we then establish a matrix valued version of abrahamse s theorem we also solve a subnormal toeplitz completion problem of 2 2 partial block toeplitz matrices further we establish a characterization of hyponormal toeplitz pairs with matrix valued bounded type symbols and then derive rank formulae for

1 introduction a function l is said to be of bounded type or in the nevanlinna class if can be written as the quotient of two functions in h this class of functions has been extensively studied in the literature however it seems to be quite difficult to determine whether the given function is of bounded type if we only look at its fourier series expansion the well known criterion for detecting bounded type employs hankel operators the function is of bounded type if and only if the kernel of the hankel operator h with symbol is nonzero cf ab the class of functions of bounded type plays an important role in the study of function theory and operator theory indeed for functions of bounded type there is a nice connection between function theory and operator theory in 1970 p r halmos posed the following problem listed as problem 5 in his lectures ten problems in hilbert space hal 1 hal 2 is every subnormal toeplitz operator either normal or analytic many authors have given partial answers to halmos problem 5 in 1984 halmos problem 5 was answered in the negative by c cowen and j long col they found a symbol not of bounded type which is non analytic and induces a non normal subnormal toeplitz operator to date researchers have been unable to characterize subnormal toeplitz operators in terms of their symbols the most interesting partial answer to halmos s problem 5 was given by m b abrahamse ab every subnormal toeplitz operator t whose symbol is such that or is of bounded type is either normal or analytic besides that there are several fruitful interplays between function theory and operator theory for functions of bounded type in the present paper we explore matrix functions of bounded type in l mn the space of n n matrix valued bounded measurable functions on the unit circle that is matrix functions whose entries are of bounded type we concentrate on the connections between function theory and operator theory for the function theoretic aspects we focus on coprime inner functions the douglas shapiro shields factorization tensored scalar singularity an interpolation problem and a functional calculus first of all we consider the following intrin sic question how does one determine the coprime ness of two inner functions in h this question is easy for blaschke products thus we are interested in the following question when are two singular inner functions coprime naturally a measure theoretic problem arises at once since singular inner functions correspond to their singular measures we answer this question in chapter 3 as we may expect we will show that two singular inner functions are coprime if and only if the corresponding singular measures are mutually singular cf theorem 3 7 to prove this we use a notion of infimum of finite positive borel measures on the 1 2 1 introduction unit circle t and more generally on a locally compact hausdorff space the key point of this argument is to decide when is the infimum of two finite positive borel measures nonzero cf theorem 3 3 to properly understand matrix functions of bounded type we need to factorize those functions into coprime products of matrix inner functions and the adjoints of matrix h functions in general every matrix function of bounded type can be represented by a left or a right coprime factorization the so called douglas shapiro shields factorization cf remark 4 2 in particular this factorization is very helpful and somewhat inevitable for the study of hankel and toeplitz operators with such symbols in chapter 4 we consider several properties of left or right coprime factorizations for matrix functions of bounded type first of all we consider the following question if a is a matrix h function and is a matrix inner function does it follow that a and are left coprime if and only if a and are right coprime in other words do the notions of left coprime ness and right coprime ness coincide for a and the answer to this question is negative in general however we can show that the answer is affirmative if is diagonal constant that is is a diagonal inner function constant along the diagonal cf theorem 4 16 we also show that if is a matrix h function such that is of bounded type and its determinant is not identically zero then the degree of the inner part of its inner outer factorization is less than or equal to the degree of the inner part of its left coprime factorization cf corollary 4 34 in fact the degree of the inner part of the left coprime factorization is equal to the degree of the inner part of the right coprime factorization cf lemma 4 31 on the other hand it is well known that the composition of two inner functions is again an inner function but we cannot guarantee that the composition of two blaschke products is again a blaschke product thus we are interested in the question if and are coprime finite blaschke products and is an inner function are the compositions and coprime we prove that the answer is affirmative when the common zeros of and lie in some range set of at its singularity almost everywhere in the open unit disk cf theorem 4 25 moreover we show that if is a matrix rational function whose determinant is not identically zero then for a finite blaschke product the inner part of the right coprime factorization of the composition is exactly the composition of the inner part of and cf theorem 4 38 this is still true for matrix functions of bounded type if is a blaschke factor cf theorem 4 40 we next ask the question how does one define a singularity for matrix func tions of bounded type conventionally the singularity or the existence of a pole of matrix l functions is defined by a singularity or a pole of some entry of the matrix function cf bgr br however we propose another notion of sin gularity which is more suitable for our study of hankel and toeplitz operators in chapter 5 we give a new notion that of tensored scalar singularity this new definition uses the hankel operator as a characterization of functions of bounded type via the kernel of the hankel operator this notion provides an answer to the question under which conditions does it follow that if the product of two hankel operators with matrix valued bounded type symbols is zero then either of them is zero it is well known that the answer to this question for scalar valued cases is affirmative but is negative for matrix valued cases unless certain assumptions are made about the symbols here we show that if either of the two symbols has a 1 introduction 3 tensored scalar singularity then the answer is affirmative cf theorem 5 4 we also consider the question if and are matrix functions of bounded type when is h h h h where h h are hankel operators we answer this ques tion as follows if or has a tensored scalar singularity then two products are equal only when the co analytic parts of and coincide up to a unitary constant left factor cf theorem 5 5 as transitional aspects from function theory to operator theory in chapter 6 we consider an interpolation problem for matrix functions of bounded type and a functional calculus for the compressions of the shift operator we consider an interpolation problem involving the following matrix valued functional equation when is k a matrix h function where is a matrix l function and k is an unknown matrix h function in other words when does there exist a matrix h function k such that k is a matrix h function if is a matrix valued rational function this interpolation problem reduces to the classical hermite feje r interpolation problem we here examine this interpolation prob lem for the matrix functions of bounded type cf theorems 6 4 and 6 5 on the other hand it is well known that the functional calculus for polynomials of the compressions of the shift results in the hermite feje r matrix via the classi cal hermite feje r interpolation problem we also extend the polynomial calculus to the h functional calculus the so called sz nagy foias functional calculus via the triangularization theorem and then extend it to a h h functional calculus for the compressions of the shift chapters 7 9 are devoted to operator theoretic aspects in chapter 7 we consider the subnormality of toeplitz operators with matrix valued symbols and in particular the matrix valued version of halmos s problem 5 hal 1 hal 2 which subnormal toeplitz operators with matrix valued symbols are either normal or analytic in 1976 m b abrahamse ab showed that if l is such that or is of bounded type if t is hyponormal and if the kernel of the self commutator of t is invariant under t then t is either normal or analytic the aim of this chapter is to establish a matrix valued version of abrahamse s theorem in fact a straightforward matrix valued version of abrahamse s theorem may fail recently it was shown in chl 1 that if and are matrix functions of bounded type with the constraint that the inner part of the right coprime factorization of the co analytic part is diagonal constant then a matrix valued version of abrahamse s theorem holds for t also it was shown in chkl that if is a matrix valued rational function then the above diagonal constant condition can be weakened to the condition of having a nonconstant diagonal constant inner divisor from the results of chapter 5 cf lemma 5 2 we can see that those conditions of chl 1 and chkl are special cases of the condition of having a tensored scalar singularity indeed in chapter 7 we will show that if the symbol has a tensored scalar singularity then we get a full fledged matrix valued version of abrahamse s theorem cf theorem 7 3 in particular if the symbol is scalar valued then it vacuously has a tensored scalar singularity so that the matrix valued version reduces to the original abrahamse s theorem given a partially specified operator matrix with some known entries the prob lem of finding suitable operators to complete the given partial operator matrix so that the resulting matrix satisfies certain given properties is called a completion problem a subnormal completion of a partial operator matrix is a particular 4 1 introduction specification of the unspecified entries resulting in a subnormal operator in chap ter 8 we solve the following subnormal toeplitz completion problem find the unspecified toeplitz entries of the partial block toeplitz matrix a t b t b d so that a becomes subnormal where b is a blaschke factor whose zero is we can here show that the unspecified entries have symbols that are matrix functions of bounded type thus this problem reduces to a problem on the subnormality of bounded type toeplitz operators recently in chl 2 we have considered this completion problem for the cases 0 the solution given in chl 2 theo rem 5 1 relies upon very intricate and long computations using the symbol involved however our solution in this chapter provides a shorter and more insightful proof by employing the results of the previous chapter our solution also shows that 2 hyponormality subnormality and normality coincide for this completion except in a special case cf theorem 8 2 on the other hand normal toeplitz operators were characterized by a property of their symbols in the early 1960 s by a brown and p r halmos bh the ex act nature of the relationship between the symbol l and the hyponormality of the toeplitz operator t was understood in 1988 via cowen s theorem co 2 this elegant and useful theorem has been used in the works cul 1 cul 2 fl gu 1 gu 2 gs hkl 1 hkl 2 hl 1 hl 2 hl 3 le nt zhu and others these works have been devoted to the study of hyponormality for toeplitz operators on h 2 particular attention has been paid to toeplitz operators with polynomial symbols or rational symbols hl 1 hl 2 hl 3 however the case of arbitrary symbol though solved in principle by cowen s theorem is in practice very complicated indeed it may not even be possible to find tractable nec essary and sufficient condition for the hyponormality of t in terms of the fourier coefficients of the symbol unless certain assumptions are made about it to date tractable criteria for the cases of trigonometric polynomial symbols and ra tional symbols have been derived from a carathe odory schur interpolation problem zhu and a tangential hermite feje r interpolation problem gu 1 or the classical hermite feje r interpolation problem hl 3 recently c gu j hendricks and d rutherford ghr have considered the hyponormality of toeplitz operators with matrix valued symbols and characterized it in terms of their symbols in particu lar they showed that if t is a hyponormal toeplitz operator with matrix valued symbol then its symbol is normal i e their characterization resembles cowen s theorem except for an additional condition the normality of the symbol in 1988 two important developments took place in the field of operator theory the first one was the introduction of the notion of joint hyponormality for n tuples of operators and the second one was the characterization of hyponormality of toeplitz operators in terms of their symbols via cowen s theorem as we have remarked just above since then it has become natural to consider joint hyponor mality for tuples of toeplitz operators the notion of joint hyponormality was first formally introduced by a athavale at he conceived joint hyponormality as a notion at least as strong as requiring that the linear span of the operator coordinates consist of hyponormal operators the latter notion being called weak joint hyponor mality joint hyponormality and weak joint hyponormality have been studied by 1 introduction 5 a athavale at j conway and w szymanski cs r curto cu r curto and w y lee cul 1 r curto p muhly and j xia cmx r douglas v paulsen and k yan dpy r douglas and k yan dy d farenick and r mceachin fm c gu gu 2 s mccullough and v paulsen mccp 1 mccp 2 d xia xi and others joint hyponormality originated from questions about commuting normal extensions of commuting operators and it has also been considered with an aim at understanding the gap between hyponormality and subnormality for sin gle operators the study of jointly hyponormal toeplitz tuples started with d farenick and r mceachin fm they studied operators that form jointly hy ponormal pairs in the presence of the unilateral shift precisely they showed that if u is the unilateral shift on the hardy space h 2 then the joint hyponormality of the pair u t implies that t is necessarily a toeplitz operator this result invites us to consider the joint hyponormality for pairs of toeplitz operators in chapter 9 we consider jointly hyponormal toeplitz pairs with matrix valued bounded type symbols in their research monograph cul 1 the authors studied hyponormal ity of pairs of toeplitz operators called toeplitz pairs when both symbols are trigonometric polynomials the core of the main result of cul 1 is that the hyponormality of t t t trigonometric polynomials forces that the co analytic parts of and necessarily coincide up to a constant multiple i e 1 1 h 2 for some c in hl 4 9 1 was extended for toeplitz pairs whose symbols are rational functions with some constraint as a result the following question arises at once does 1 1 still hold for toeplitz pairs whose symbols are matrix valued trigonometric polynomials or rational functions chapter 9 is concerned with this question more generally we give a charac terization of hyponormal toeplitz pairs with bounded type symbols by using the theory established in the previous chapters consequently we will answer the above question cf corollary 9 22 indeed 1 1 is still true for matrix valued trigonometric polynomials under some invertibility and commutativity assumptions on the fourier coefficients of the symbols those assumptions always hold vacuously for scalar valued cases in fact this follows from our core idea lemma 9 16 that if and are matrix functions of bounded type whose inner parts of right co prime factorizations of analytic parts commute and whose co analytic parts have a common tensored scalar pole then the hyponormality of the toeplitz pair t t implies that the common tensored scalar pole has the same order consequently we give a characterization of the joint hyponormality of toeplitz pairs with bounded type symbols cf theorem 9 20 we also consider the self commutators of the toeplitz pairs with matrix valued rational symbols and derive rank formulae for them cf theorem 9 29 chapter 10 is devoted to concluding remarks and open questions acknowledgments the authors are deeply grateful to the referee for many help ful suggestions which significantly improved both the content and the presentation in particular we are indebted to the referee for supplying the present version of the proof of lemma 4 13 which is more transparent than the original proof chapter 2 preliminaries the main ingredients of this paper are functions of bounded type hankel op erators toeplitz operators and hyponormality first of all we review the notion of functions of bounded type and a few essential facts about hankel and toeplitz operators and for that we will use ab bs do 1 ggk mar ni 2 and pe let h and k be complex hilbert spaces let b h k be the set of bounded linear operators from h to k and write b h b h h for a b b h we let a b ab ba an operator t b h is said to be normal if t t 0 hyponormal if t t 0 for an operator t b h we write kert and rant for the kernel and the range of t respectively for a subset m of a hilbert space h clm and m denote the closure and the orthogonal complement of m respec tively also let t d be the unit circle where d denotes the open unit disk in the complex plane c recall that l l t is the set of bounded measurable functions on t that the hilbert space l 2 l 2 t has a canonical orthonormal basis given by the trigonometric functions en z z n for all n z and that the hardy space h 2 h 2 t is the closed linear span of en n 0 an element f l 2 is said to be analytic if f h 2 let h l h 2 i e h is the set of bounded analytic functions on d given a function l the toeplitz operator t and the hankel operator h with symbol on h 2 are defined by 2 1 t g p g and h g jp g g h 2 where p and p denote the orthogonal projections from l 2 onto h 2 and h 2 respectively and j denotes the unitary operator from l 2 onto l 2 defined by j f z zf z for f l 2 for l we write p h 2 and p zh 2 thus we may write we recall that a function l is said to be of bounded type or in the nevanlinna class n if there are functions 1 2 h such that z 1 z 2 z for almost all z t let bmo denote the set of functions of bounded mean oscillation in l 1 it is well known that l bmo l 2 and that if f l 2 then hf is bounded on h 2 if and only if p f bmo where p is the orthogonal projection of l 2 onto h 2 cf pe thus if l then bmo so that h and h are well understood we recall ab lemma 3 that if l then 2 2 is of bounded type kerh 6 0 7 8 2 preliminaries assume now that both and are of bounded type then from the beurling s theorem kerh 0 h 2 and kerh h 2 for some inner functions 0 we thus have b 0 h 2 and hence we can write 2 3 0 b and similarly a for some a h 2 by kronecker s lemma ni 2 p 217 if f h then f is a rational function if and only if rankh f which implies that 2 4 f is rational f b with a finite blaschke product if t is hyponormal then since t t t h h l and hence 2 5 t t h h h h h h h h it follows that h f h f for all f h 2 and hence h 2 kerh kerh 0 h 2 which implies that 0 divides i e 0 1 for some inner function 1 for an inner function we write h h 2 h 2 note that if f a l 2 then f h 2 if and only if a h z in particular if f 0 0 then a h thus if l is such that and are of bounded type such that 0 0 and t is hyponormal then we can write 0 1 a and 0 b where a h 0 1 and b h 0 we turn our attention to the case of matrix functions let mn r denote the set of all n r complex matrices and write mn mn n for x a hilbert space let l 2 x l 2 x t be the hilbert space of x valued norm square integrable measurable functions on t and let l x l x t be the set of x valued bounded measurable functions on t we also let h 2 x h 2 x t be the corresponding hardy space and h x h x t l x h 2 x we observe that l 2 cn l 2 cn and h 2 cn h 2 cn definition 2 1 for a matrix valued function ij l mn we say that is of bounded type if each entry ij is of bounded type and we say that is rational if each entry ij is a rational function let ij l mn be such that is of bounded type then each ij is of bounded type thus in view of 2 3 we may write ij ijbij where ij is inner and ij and bij are coprime in other words there does not exist a nonconstant inner divisor of ij and bij thus if is the least common multiple of ij i j 1 2 n then we may write 2 6 ij ijbij aij a where a aji h 2 mn in particular a is nonzero whenever 0 and 1 for l mn we write pn h 2 mn and p n h 2 mn thus we may write however it will often be convenient to allow the constant term in hence if there is no confusion we may assume that shares the constant term with in this case 0 0 0 if 2 preliminaries 9 l mn is such that and are of bounded type then in view of 2 6 we may write 2 7 1 a and 2 b where 1 and 2 are inner functions and a b h 2 mn in particular if l mn is rational then the i can be chosen as finite blaschke products as we observed in 2 4 we now introduce the notion of hankel operators and toeplitz operators with matrix valued symbols if is a matrix valued function in l mn then t h 2 cn h 2 cn denotes toeplitz operator with symbol defined by t f pn f for f h 2 cn where pn is the orthogonal projection of l 2 cn onto h 2 cn a hankel operator with symbol l mn is an operator h h 2 cn h 2 cn defined by h f jnp n f for f h 2 cn where p n is the orthogonal projection of l 2 cn onto h 2 cn and jn denotes the unitary operator from l 2 cn onto l 2 cn given by jn f z zf z for f l 2 cn for l mn m write z z a matrix valued function h mn m is called inner if im almost every where on t where im denotes the m m identity matrix if there is no confusion we write simply i for im the following basic relations can be easily derived t t h h l mn 2 8 t t t h h l mn 2 9 h t h h t h l mn h mn 2 10 h h h h h h h h h mn inner l mn 2 11 a matrix valued trigonometric polynomial l mn m is of the form z n j m ajz j aj mn m where an and a m are called the outer coefficients of for matrix valued functions a j ajz j l 2 mn m and b j bjz j l 2 mn m we define the inner product of a and b by a b t tr b a d j tr b jaj where tr denotes the trace of a matrix and define a 2 a a 1 2 we also define for a l mn m a ess supt t a t denotes the spectral norm of a matrix finally the shift operator s on h 2 cn is defined by s tzi the following fundamental result will be useful in the sequel the beurling lax halmos theorem ff ni 2 a nonzero subspace m of h 2 cn is invariant for the shift operator s on h 2 cn if and only if m h 2 cm where 10 2 preliminaries is an inner matrix function in h mn m m n furthermore is unique up to a unitary constant right factor that is if m h 2 cr for an inner function in h mn r then m r and w where w is a unitary matrix mapping c m onto cm as customarily done we say that two matrix valued functions a and b are equal if they are equal up to a unitary constant right factor observe that by 2 10 for l mn h s h zi hzi s h which implies that the kernel of a hankel operatorh is an invariant subspace of the shift operator on h 2 cn thus if kerh 6 0 then by the beurling lax halmos theorem kerh h 2 cm for some inner matrix function we note that need not be a square matrix however we have lemma 2 2 ghr theorem 2 2 for l mn the following are equivalent a is of bounded type b ker h h 2 cn for some square inner matrix function we recall that an operator t b h is said to be subnormal if t has a normal extension i e t n h where n is a normal operator on some hilbert space k h such that h is invariant for n the bram halmos criterion for subnormality br con states that an operator t b h is subnormal if and only if i j t ixj t jxi 0 for all finite collections x 0 x 1 xk h it is easy to see that this is equivalent to the following positivity test 2 12 t t t 2 t t k t t t 2 t 2 t 2 t k t 2 t t k t 2 t k t k t k 0 all k 1 condition 2 12 provides a measure of the gap between hyponormality and sub normality in fact the positivity condition 2 12 for k 1 is equivalent to the hyponormality of t while subnormality requires the validity of 2 12 for all k for k 1 an operator t is said to be k hyponormal if t satisfies the positivity condition 2 12 for a fixed k thus the bram halmos criterion can be stated as t is subnor mal if and only if t is k hyponormal for all k 1 the notion of k hyponormality has been considered by many authors aiming at understanding the bridge between hyponormality and subnormality in view of 2 12 between hyponormality and subnormality there exists a whole slew of increasingly stricter conditions each ex pressible in terms of the joint hyponormality of the tuples i t t 2 t k given an n tuple t t 1 tn of operators on h we let t t b h h denote the self commutator of t defined by t t t 1 t 1 t 2 t 1 t n t 1 t 1 t 2 t 2 t 2 t n t 2 t 1 tn t 2 tn t n tn 2 preliminaries 11 by analogy with the case n 1 we shall say at cmx that t is jointly hyponormal or simply hyponormal if t t is a positive operator on h h t is said to be normal if t is commuting and every ti is a normal operator and subnormal if t is the restriction of a normal n tuple to a common invariant subspace clearly the normality subnormality or hyponormality of an n tuple requires as a necessary condition that every coordinate in the tuple be normal subnormal or hyponormal respectively normality and subnormality require that the coordinates commute but hyponormality does not in 1988 the hyponormality of the toeplitz operators t was characterized in terms of their symbols via cowen s theorem co 2 which follows cowen s theorem co 2 nt for each l let e k h k 1 and k h then t is hyponormal if and only if e is nonempty to study hyponormality resp normality and subnormality of the toeplitz operator t with symbol we may without loss of generality assume that 0 0 this is because hyponormality resp normality and subnormality is invariant under translations by scalars in 2006 c gu j hendricks and d rutherford ghr have considered the hyponormality of toeplitz operators with matrix valued symbols and characterized it in terms of their symbols their characterization resembles cowen s theorem except for an additional condition the normality of the symbol lemma 2 3 hyponormality of block toeplitz operators ghr for each l mn let e k h mn k 1 and k h mn then t is hyponormal if and only if is normal and e is nonempty m abrahamse ab lemma 6 showed that if t is hyponormal if h and if or is of bounded type then both and are of bounded type however in contrast to the scalar valued case may not be of bounded type even though t is hyponormal h mn and is of bounded type but we have a one way implication 2 13 t is hyponormal and is of bounded type is of bounded type see ghr corollary 3 5 and remark 3 6 thus whenever we deal with hy ponormal toeplitz operators t with symbols satisfying that both and are of bounded type e g is a matrix valued rational function it suffices to assume that only is of bounded type in spite of this fact for convenience we will assume that and are of bounded type whenever we deal with bounded type symbols 12 2 preliminaries notations let be an inner function in h then i i where i is the identity matrix z the set of all zeros of b z z 1 z d a blaschke factor h 20 h 2 mn 0 zh 2 mn let h mn m be an inner matrix function then h h 2 cn h 2 cm h h 2 mn m h 2 mm k h 2 mn m h 2 mn if i for an inner function then h k if there is no confusion then we write for brevity h k for hi ki for x a closed subspace of h 2 mn px denotes the orthogonal projection from h 2 mn onto x if l mn and 1 and 2 are inner matrix functions in h mn we write 1 2 p h 2 mn 1 ph 20 2 1 2 p h 2 mn 1 ph 20 2 and abbreviate and if i i i for some inner functions i i 1 2 then 1 2 1 2 if there is no confusion then we write for brevity i 1 2 1 2 1 i 2 1 2 i and etc i e we write for i in this representation for an inner function u denotes the compression of the shift operator u tz i e u ph u h more generally for a l mn and an inner function h mn we write ta ph ta h which is called the compression of ta to h chapter 3 coprime inner functions to understand functions of bounded type we need to factorize those func tions into a coprime product of an inner function and the complex conjugate of an h 2 function thus we are interested in the following question when are two inner functions in h coprime naturally a measure theoretic problem arises at once since singular inner functions correspond to their singular measures in this chapter we answer this question a nonzero sequence j in d satisfying j 1 1 j is called a blaschke sequence if j is a blaschke sequence and k is an integer k 0 then the function b z zk j 1 j j z j 1 jz is called a blaschke product the factor zk in the definition of the blaschke product is to allow b to have a zero at 0 if j is a finite sequence then b is called a finite blaschke product recall that an inner function h can be written as z c b z exp t t z t z d t z d where c is a constant of modulus 1 b is a blaschke product and is a finite positive borel measure on t which is singular with respect to lebesgue measure it is evident that if b 1 and b 2 are blaschke products then 3 1 b 1 and b 2 are not coprime z b 1 z b 2 6 thus the difficulty in determining coprime ness of two inner functions is caused by an inner functions having no zeros in d which is called a singular inner function z exp t t z t z d t where will be called the singular measure of thus we are interested in the following question 3 2 when are two singular inner functions coprime question 3 2 seems to be well known to experts however we have not been able to find an answer in the literature thus below we give an answer to question 3 2 let be a borel measure on a locally compact hausdorff space x recall that the support of is defined as the set supp x x g 0 for every open neighborhood g of x 13 14 3 coprime inner functions an equivalent definition of support of is as the largest closed set s x such that for every open subset u of x for which s u 6 3 3 sc 0 and u s 0 on the other hand if there is a borel set a such that e a e for every borel set e we say that is concentrated on a cf ru this is equivalent to the condition that e 0 whenever e a also we say that two borel measures and are mutually singular and write if there are disjoint borel sets a and b such that is concentrated on a and is concentrated on b we note that if supp supp then however the converse is not true for example if m is the lebesgue measure on 0 1 and 1 is the dirac measure at 1 then m 1 but supp m supp 1 1 how does one define the infimum of a family of finite positive borel measures let s 1 2 be a countable family of finite positive borel measures on a locally compact hausdorff space x for any borel set e define e by 3 4 e inf k k ek where the k runs through the family s and where e 1 e 2 runs through all partitions of e into borel sets cf ga p 84 then we can show that is a positive borel measure satisfying the following i k for all k 1 2 ii is the maximum positive borel measure on x satisfying i in the sense that if is a positive borel measure on x satisfying k for all k 1 2 then the measure of 3 4 is called the infimum of the family s of measures and we write inf k k we note that the infimum of two nonzero measures may be zero for example let x 0 1 and suppose m is the lebesgue measure on x and 1 is the dirac measure at 1 then x inf m 1 x m 1 1 0 1 0 theorem 3 1 let k be a countable family of finite positive borel measures on a locally compact hausdorff space x if k is concentrated on ak for each k z then infk k is concentrated on n an proof write a k ak and inf k k let e be a borel set and suppose en is a partition of e into borel sets let fn en a and a k n en ak then we can see that e nfn n ka k n 3 coprime inner functions 15 let cn be the collection consisting of fn a k n n k we then have 3 5 e inf k k ck inf k k fk inf k k ek a since e a n en a it follows from 3 5 that e e a this completes the proof corollary 3 2 let k be a countable family of finite positive borel mea sures on a locally compact hausdorff space x if i j for some i j then infk k 0 proof immediate from theorem 3 1 theorem 3 3 let 1 and 2 be finite positive borel measures on a borel algebra b in a locally compact hausdorff space x then 1 2 inf 1 2 0 proof this follows from theorem 3 1 suppose 1 and 2 are finite positive borel measures by the lebesgue decomposition of 1 relative to 2 there exists a unique pair a s of finite positive measures on b such that 1 a s a 2 s 2 let h l 1 2 be the radon nikodym derivative of a with respect to 2 that is 3 6 a e e h d 2 e b note that h is a nonnegative measurable function assume that 1 and 2 are not mutually singular then h 6 0 2 define h x x 0 h x 1 there are two cases to consider case 1 2 h 6 0 define e e h h d 2 e b since h h is a nonnegative measurable function it follows that is a positive measure observe that h h hd 2 0 for each e b we have by 3 6 e e h hd 2 e hd 2 a e 1 e 16 3 coprime inner functions and by definition of h e e h hd 2 e d 2 2 e but since h 0 it follows that 0 6 inf 1 2 which implies inf 1 2 6 0 cases 2 2 h 0 for m 2 3 4 define hm x x 1 h x m since h 6 0 2 there exists n 2 3 such that 2 hn 6 0 define e 1 n e h hn d 2 e b then is a positive measure observe that hn 1 n hn h d 2 1 n hn d 2 1 n 2 hn 0 for each e b e 1 n e h hn d 2 1 n e hd 2 e hd 2 a e 1 e and by definition of hn e 1 n e h hn d 2 e d 2 2 e since hn 0 it follows that 0 6 inf 1 2 which implies inf 1 2 6 0 this completes the proof corollary 3 4 let 1 2 m be a finite collection of finite positive borel measures on a locally compact hausdorff space x then the followings are equivalent i inf 1 2 m 6 0 ii if k is concentrated on ak for each k 1 2 m then m k 1 ak 6 proof this follows at once from theorems 3 1 and 3 3 remark 3 5 corollary 3 4 may fail for a countable collection of finite positive borel measures for example let be a nonzero finite positive borel measure on a locally compact hausdorff space x and let k k k z then clearly infk k 0 suppose that k is concentrated on ak for each k z then is concentrated on ak for each k z write e k 1 ak and en n k 1 ak then e 1 e 2 e 3 and e n 1 en 3 coprime inner functions 17 we now claim that 3 7 en x for each n z to prove 3 7 we use mathematical induction since is concentrated on a 1 e 1 it follows that e 1 e 1 x x suppose ek x k 1 since is concentrated on ak 1 we have ek 1 ek ak 1 ek x which proves 3 7 since is a finite measure x en converges to e so that e x 6 0 and hence e 6 theorem 3 6 let 1 2 be finite positive regular borel measures on a locally compact hausdorff space x such that s supp 1 supp 2 6 if there exists x s and an open neighborhood n of x such that m 2 nx 1 nx x nx an open subset of n m for some m m 0 then inf 1 2 6 0 remark since x s i nx 6 0 for each i 1 2 proof of theorem 3 6 suppose that there exists x s and an open neigh borhood n of x such that m 2 nx 1 nx x nx an open subset of n m for some 0 m 1 m we will show that 3 8 n 6 0 note that 1 and 2 are regular borel measures let g be a borel set and 0 suppose x g then there exists an open set v g such that 1 n g 1 n v 1 m 2 n v thus 1 n g 2 n gc 1 m 2 n v 2 n gc 1 m 2 n g 2 n gc 1 m 2 n which gives 1 n g 2 n gc 1 m 2 n if x g then similarly we have 1 n g 2 n gc m 1 n thus it follows that n inf 1 2 n min 1 m 2 n m 1 n 0 which proves 3 8 18 3 coprime inner functions we now have theorem 3 7 let 1 2 h be singular inner functions with singular measures 1 and 2 respectively then 1 and 2 are coprime if and only if 1 2 proof for i 1 2 write i z exp t t z t z d i t z d where each i is a finite positive borel measure on t which is singular with respect to lebesgue measure assume that 1 and 2 are not mutually singular thus by theorem 3 3 inf 1 2 6 0 since 3 9 e 1 e and e 2 e for each borel set e t it follows that is absolutely continuous with respect to both 1 and 2 in particular is a finite positive borel measure on t also since 1 is singular with respect to lebesgue measure is singular with respect to lebesgue measure thus it follows from 3 9 that i i i 1 2 is a finite positive borel measure which is singular with respect to lebesgue measure since i t i t we can see that i is regular for each i 1 2 observe that exp t t z t z d 1 t exp t t z t z d t exp t t z t z d 1 t thus z exp t t z t z d t z d is a nonconstant inner divisor of 1 similarly we can show that is also a non constant inner divisor of 2 hence 1 and 2 are not coprime assume that 1 and 2 are not coprime thus there exists a nonconstant common inner divisor of 1 and 2 i e 3 10 1 1 and 2 2 note that is also a singular inner function so that we may write z exp t t z t z d t where is a nonzero finite positive borel measure on t which is singular with respect to lebesgue measure if 1 and 2 are singular measures corresponding to 1 and 2 respectively then it follows from 3 10 that d i d i i 1 2 thus we can see that e i e for every borel set e of t since is nonzero it follows from theorem 3 1 that 1 and 2 are not mutually singular remark 3 8 by a similar argument as in the proof of theorem 3 7 we can show that if 1 and 2 are singular inner functions with singular measures 1 and 2 respectively and if inf 1 2 then z exp t t z t z d t is the greatest common inner divisor of 1 and 2 chapter 4 douglas shapiro shields factorizations to understand matrix functions of bounded type we need to factor those func tions into a coprime product of matrix inner functions and the adjoints of matrix h functions this is the so called douglas shapiro shields factorization this factorization is very helpful and somewhat unavoidable for the study of hankel and toeplitz operators with bounded type symbols in this chapter we consider several properties of the douglas shapiro shields factorization for matrix functions of bounded type for a matrix valued function h 2 mn r we say that h 2 mn m is a left inner divisor of if is an inner matrix function such that a for some a h 2 mm r m n we also say that two matrix functions h 2 mn r and h 2 mn m are left coprime if the only common left inner divisor of both and is a unitary constant and that h 2 mn r and h 2 mm r are right coprime if and are left coprime two matrix functions and in h 2 mn are said to be coprime if they are both left and right coprime we note that if h 2 mn is such that det 6 0 then any left inner divisor of is square i e h 2 mn indeed if a with h 2 mn r r n then rank z rank z r n so that det z 0 if h 2 mn is such that det 6 0 then we say that h 2 mn is a right inner divisor of if is a left inner divisor of let i h mn i j be a family of inner matrix functions the greatest common left inner divisor d and the least common left inner multiple m of the family i h mn i j are the inner functions defined by dh 2 cp i j ih 2 cn and mh 2 cq i j ih 2 cn similarly the greatest common right inner divisor d and the least common right inner multiple m of the family i h mn i j are the inner functions defined by dh 2 cr i j ih 2 cn and mh 2 cs i j ih 2 cn the beurling lax halmos theorem guarantees that d and m exist and are unique up to a unitary constant right factor and d and m are unique up to a unitary constant left factor we write d left g c d i i j m left l c m i i j d right g c d i i j m right l c m i i j 19 20 4 douglas shapiro shields factorizations if n 1 then left g c d right g c d simply denoted g c d and left l c m right l c m simply denoted l c m in general it is not true that left g c d right g c d and left l c m right l c m however we have lemma 4 1 let i i i for an inner function i i j a left g c d i i j right g c d i i j i d where d g c d i i j b left l c m i i j right l c m i i j i m where m l c m i i j proof see chl 2 lemma 2 1 in view of lemma 4 1 if i i i for an inner function i i j we can define the greatest common inner divisor d and the least common inner multiple m of the i by d g c d i i j i d where d g c d i i j and m l c m i i j i m where m l c m i i j both d and m are diagonal constant inner functions i e diagonal inner func tions and constant along the diagonal remark 4 2 by contrast with scalar valued functions in 2 6 i and a need not be right coprime if left g c d i a in the representation 2 6 that is a then i and a a for some inner matrix where h 2 mn because det i 6 0 and some al h 2 mn therefore if l mn is of bounded type then we can write 4 1 a where a and are left coprime in this case a is called the left coprime factorization of and write briefly a left coprime similarly we can write 4 2 ra r where ar and r are right coprime in this case ra r is called the right coprime factorization of and we write succinctly ra r right coprime we often say that 4 2 is the douglas shapiro shields factorization of and 4 1 is the left douglas shapiro shields factorization of cf dss fu we also say that and r are called the inner parts of those factorizations remark 4 3 ghr corollary 2 5 chl 2 remark 2 2 as a consequence of the beurling lax halmos theorem we can see that 4 3 ra r right coprime kerh rh 2 cn 4 douglas shapiro shields factorizations 21 if m is a nonzero closed subspace of cn then the matrix function b pm i pm pm the orthogonal projection of cn onto m is called a blaschke potapov factor an n n matrix function d is called a finite blaschke potapov product if d is of the form d m m 1 bmpm i pm where is an n n unitary constant matrix bm is a blaschke factor and pm is an orthogonal projection in cn for each m 1 m in particular a scalar valued function d reduces to a finite blaschke product d m m 1 bm it is known cf po that an n n matrix function d is rational and inner if and only if it can be represented as a finite blaschke potapov product if l mn is rational then and r in 4 1 and 4 2 can be chosen as finite blaschke potapov products we can see cf chl 2 that every inner divisor of ib h mn is a blaschke potapov factor in what follows we examine the left and right coprime factorizations of matrix h 2 functions we begin with lemma 4 4 let h mn m be an inner matrix function and a h 2 mn m then the following hold a a k a h 20 b a h a h 20 c ph 20 a pk a proof immediate from a direct calculation lemma 4 5 let h mn m be an inner matrix function and b h 2 mn m then the following hold a pk b ph b if n m b pk b pk b for any constant matrix mn c ph b ph b for any constant matrix mm in particular if n m and i for an inner function and commutes with b then pk b pk b proof write b b 1 b 2 where b 1 pk b and b 2 b 3 for some b 3 h 2 mn then b b 1 b 3 if n m then is an inner matrix function since b 1 k by lemma 4 4 a we have b 1 h 20 so that b 1 b 1 h 20 thus it follows from lemma 4 4 b that b 1 h and hence ph b b 1 p k b giving a observe that pk b pk b 1 b 3 pk b 1 since b 1 k it follows from lemma 4 4 a that b 1 h 20 thus b 1 b 1 h 20 22 4 douglas shapiro shields factorizations which implies b 1 k and hence pk b b 1 pk b this proves b the statement c follows from a and b the last assertion follows at once from b and c because h k if i lemma 4 6 let h mn and h mn m be inner matrix functions then the following hold a k k k b h h h proof the inclusion k k is obvious it also follows from lemma 4 4 a that k k thus k k k for the reverse inclusion suppose m k write m 1 pk m then m m 1 q for some q h 2 mn m since m 1 k k we have q m m 1 k thus by lemma 4 4 a q q h 20 and hence again by lemma 4 4 a q k which gives a the argument for b is similar lemma 4 7 suppose a b c h mn with ab ba if a and b are left coprime and a and c are left coprime then a and bc are left coprime proof if a and b are left coprime and a and c are left coprime then it follows cf ff p 242 that h 2 cn ah 2 cn bh 2 cn ah 2 cn ch 2 cn then the limit argument together with the commutativity of a and b shows that h 2 cn ah 2 cn bch 2 cn which gives the result corollary 4 8 let a b h mn and be an inner function if a and b are left coprime and a and i are left coprime then a and b are left coprime proof immediate from lemma 4 7 corollary 4 9 suppose that a b c h mn with ab ba if a and b are right coprime and a and c are right coprime then a and cb are right coprime proof this follows from lemma 4 7 together with the fact that a and b are right coprime if and only if a and c are left coprime we recall the inner outer factorization of vector valued functions let d and e be hilbert spaces if f is a function with values in b e d such that f e h 2 d for each e e then f is called a strong h 2 function the strong h 2 function f is called an inner function if f is an isometric operator from d into e write pe for the set of all polynomials with values in e i e p n k 0 p k k p k e then the function fp n k 0 f p k z k belongs to h 2 d the strong h 2 function f is called outer if clf pe h 2 d note that every f h 2 mn is a strongh 2 function we then have an analogue of the scalar factorization theorem 4 douglas shapiro shields factorizations 23 inner outer factorization cf ni 1 every strong h 2 function f with val ues in b e d can be expressed in the form f fife where fe is an outer function with values in b e d and fi is an inner function with values in b d d for some hilbert space d if dimd dime then outer operator functions can be detected by outer scalar functions helson lowdenslager theorem cf ni 2 if dimd and f is a strong h 2 function with values in b d then f is outer if and only if detf is outer we then have lemma 4 10 let h 2 mn then det 6 0 if and only if every left inner divisor of is square proof we assume to the contrary that every left inner divisor of is square but det 0 since is a strong h 2 function we have an inner outer factoriza tion of of the form i e where i h 2 mn r is inner and e h 2 mr n is outer by assumption r n we thus have 0 det det i det e which implies that det e 0 by the helson lowdenslager theorem 0 should be an outer function a contradiction the converse was noticed in p 10 we introduce a notion of the characteristic scalar inner function of a matrix inner function cf he p 81 sfbk definition 4 11 let h mn be inner we say that has a scalar inner multiple h if there exists 0 h mn such that 0 0 i we define m g c d is a scalar inner multiple of in view of lemma 4 1 m is the minimal so that 0 0 i for some 0 h mn we say that m is the characteristic scalar inner function of remark in definition 4 11 it is enough to assume 0 i for given two matrices a and b such that ab i with 6 0 it is straightforward to verify that ba ab it is well known cf sfbk proposition 5 6 1 that if h mn is inner then has a scalar inner multiple thus m is well defined we would like to remark that the notion of m arises in the sz nagy foias theory of contraction operators t of class c 0 completely nonunitary contractions t for which there exists a nonzero function u h such that u t 0 the minimal function mt of the c 0 contraction operator t amounts to our m t where t is the characteristic function of t cf be sfbk 24 4 douglas shapiro shields factorizations if ij h mn is inner we may ask how do we find m the following lemma gives an answer to see this we first observe that if ij h mn is inner then kerh h 2 cn and hence by lemma 2 2 is of bounded type and we may write ij ijbij ij inner ij and bij h coprime lemma 4 12 let h mn be inner thus we may write ijbij where ij is an inner function and ij and bij h are coprime for each i j 1 2 n then m l c m ij i j 1 2 n proof observe that 4 4 ijbij aij a a h 2 mn since is inner it follows that a a i so that a i this says that m is an inner divisor of thus we may write 4 5 m scalar inner we now want to show that is constant let im 0 for some inner function 0 it follows from 4 5 that 0 i a and hence 0 a since by 4 5 is an inner divisor of it follows that ijbij aij 0 but since ij and bij are coprime ij is inner divisor of for each i j 1 2 n thus is an inner divisor of and therefore is constant this completes the proof we observe lemma 4 13 if h 2 is a nonconstant inner function then n 1 nh 2 0 proof if is a nonconstant inner function then the wandering subspace construction from the halmos proof of the beurling lax halmos theorem implies that cf sfbk p 204 h 2 j 0 jh and more generally nh 2 j n jh thus any f h 2 has an orthogonal decomposition as f j 0 jfj with fj h if f nh 2 then fj 0 for 0 j n hence if f n 0 nh 2 then fj 0 for j 0 1 2 or f 0 4 douglas shapiro shields factorizations 25 lemma 4 14 the local rank let e and d be hilbert spaces dime and let be a strong h 2 function with values in b d e denote rank max d rank where rank dim d then f h 2 d f 0 h 2 d inner for some hilbert space d in this case dimd dimd rank proof see ni 1 p 44 lemma 4 15 let a h mn and i for some nonconstant inner function if and a are left or right coprime then det a 6 0 proof suppose and a are left coprime then by the beurling lax halmos theorem we have 4 6 h 2 cn ah 2 cn h 2 cn cf ff p 242 assume to the contrary that deta 0 then det a d eta 0 and hence rank a m n since a h mn is a strong h 2 function it follows from lemma 4 14 that kera f h 2 cn a f 0 h 2 d where is inner and dimd n m let u h 2 cn m h 2 d be unitary and put u h 2 mn n m then kera h 2 cn m so that a 0 and hence a 0 it thus follows from 4 6 that 4 7 h 2 cn h 2 cn ah 2 cn h 2 cn write ij h 2 m n m n since i it follows from 4 7 that for each p 1 2 p ij h 2 cn p h 2 cn h 2 cn h 2 cn m which implies that for each 1 i n m and 1 j n ij p 1 ph 2 since is not constant it follows from lemma 4 13 that ij 0 for all i j and hence 0 a contradiction if and a are right coprime then and a are left coprime thus by what we showed just before det a 6 0 and hence deta 6 0 this completes the proof the following theorem plays a key role in the theory of coprime factorizations theorem 4 16 for a h 2 mn and i for some scalar inner function then and a are right or left coprime if and only if and deta are coprime proof we first prove the theorem when a h mn is inner if is a diagonal constant inner function then this is trivial thus we may assume that is not diagonal constant suppose that and det are not coprime write m and i 0 0 for a nonconstant inner function 0 thus det det 0 n and hence and n and hence are not coprime put g c d then we can write i i i 1 and 4 8 i 0 i i 1 26 4 douglas shapiro shields factorizations for some inner functions 1 and 1 if then i is an inner divisor of i so that evidently and are not right coprime we now suppose 6 we then claim that 4 9 and i are not right coprime towards a proof of 4 9 we assume to the contrary that and i are right coprime since by 4 8 0 i 1 h 2 mn it follows from 2 10 that 4 10 0 h 0 h t 0 but since and i are right coprime it follows from 4 3 together with 4 10 that 0 h 2 cn rant 0 kerh h 2 cn which implies that i is a left inner divisor of 0 cf ff corollary ix 2 2 so that 0 should be inner consequently i 1 i 0 which contradicts the definition of m this proves 4 9 since i 1 i it follows that and are not right coprime conversely suppose that and are not right coprime thus 1 g and 1 g where g h mn is not unitary constant thus detg is a common inner divisor of det and det since g is not constant it follows from the fredholm theory of block toeplitz operators cf do 1 that 0 dimh g dimkertg indtg indtdetg where ind denotes the fredholm index which implies that detg is not constant and hence det and are not coprime now we prove the general case of a h 2 mn in view of lemma 4 15 we may assume that deta 6 0 then by lemma 4 10 the left and the right inner divisors of a are square thus a has the following inner outer factorizations of the form a aeai where ai h mn is inner and ae h 2 mn is outer hence by what we proved just before and helson lowdenslager theorem p 23 we can see that and a are right coprime if and only if and ai are right coprime if and only if and detai are coprime if and only if and deta are coprime for the case of left coprime ness we use z z by the case of the right coprime ness and the fact that d eta det a it follows that and deta are coprime if and only if and det a are coprime if and only if and a are right coprime if and only if and a are left coprime this completes the proof theorem 4 16 shows that if a h 2 mn and i for some scalar inner function then left coprime ness and right coprime ness coincide for a and thus if is an inner function then we shall say that a h 2 mn and i are coprime whenever they are right or left coprime hence if in the representations 4 1 and 4 2 or r is of the form i with an inner function then we shall write 4 11 a coprime lemma 4 17 let h mn be inner and i for an inner function if and are coprime and and are coprime then left l c m and are coprime 4 douglas shapiro shields factorizations 27 proof suppose that and are coprime and and are coprime then by theorem 4 16 m and are coprime and m and are coprime so that by corollary 4 8 l c m and are coprime thus 4 12 l c m h 2 cn h 2 cn h 2 cn observe that left l c m h 2 cn h 2 cn h 2 cn h 2 cn h 2 cn l c m h 2 cn it thus follows from 4 12 that left l c m h 2 cn h 2 cn l c m h 2 cn h 2 cn h 2 cn which implies that left l c m and are left coprime and hence coprime lemma 4 18 let 1 2 h mn be inner then there exist inner matrix functions 1 2 h mn such that left l c m 1 2 1 1 2 2 proof observe that left l c m 1 2 h 2 cn 1 h 2 cn 2 h 2 cn ih 2 cn i 1 2 which gives the result cf ff corollary ix 2 2 proposition 4 19 let h 2 mn be of the form a right coprime if is an inner matrix function in h 2 mn put ph 20 cf p 12 then the following hold a if is a left inner divisor of then 1 a 1 right coprime where 1 and a 1 pk 1 a b if left g c d and i 1 for an inner function 1 then 1 a 1 right coprime where 1 and a 1 pk 1 1 a c if left g c d and i 1 for an inner function 1 then 1 a 1 coprime where a 1 pk 1 a 1 with 1 proof let 1 for an inner function 1 then it follows from lemma 4 4 that ph 20 ph 20 a 1 pk 1 a suppose 1 anda 1 pk 1 a are not right coprime put 2 right g c d 1 a 1 then 2 is not unitary constant and we may write 4 13 1 3 2 and a 1 a 2 2 for some 3 a 2 h 2 mn thus 2 is a common right inner divisor of a and this is a contradiction this proves a for b we write left g c d then by assumption we may write 1 put 1 then i 1 and 1 are left coprime it follows from lemma 4 4 that ph 20 ph 20 i 1 1 a ph 20 1 1 a 1 pk 1 1 a 28 4 douglas shapiro shields factorizations note that 1 and pk 1 1 a are right coprime if and only if 1 and 1 a are right coprime now we will show that 1 and 1 a are right coprime since 1 and i 1 are left coprime it follows from theorem 4 16 that 1 and i 1 are right coprime since and a are right coprime it follows that 1 and a are right coprime thus it follows from corollary 4 9 that 1 and 1 a are right coprime this proves b for c write left g c d then by assumption we may write 1 and 1 where 1 and i 1 is left coprime then it follows from lemma 4 4 that ph 20 ph 20 1 i 1 a ph 20 i 1 a 1 i 1 pk 1 a 1 since i 1 and 1 are coprime and i 1 and a are coprime it follows from lemma 4 7 that i 1 and a 1 are coprime so that i 1 and pk 1 a 1 are coprime this completes the proof corollary 4 20 let and be finite blaschke products if h 2 mn is of the form a coprime then 4 14 ph 20 1 a 1 coprime where 1 g c d and a 1 pk 1 1 a with 1 g c d moreover a 1 is invertible for each z 1 proof the assertion 4 14 follows from proposition 4 19 put a aij n ij 1 since is a finite blaschke product 1 is also a finite blaschke product for each z 1 we have 11 z h 1 and hence 4 15 a 1 pk 1 1 a ph 1 1 aij n i j 1 ph 1 1 aij 1 1 z n i j 1 1 aij 1 1 z n i j 1 1 aij n i j 1 1 a since 1 and 1 are coprime and i and a are coprime it follows from theorem 4 16 that 1 6 0 and a is invertible thus by 4 15 a 1 is invertible corollary 4 21 let h mn be of the form b left coprime if is a right inner divisor of and ph 20 then b 1 1 left coprime 4 douglas shapiro shields factorizations 29 where 1 and b 1 ph 1 b proof since b right coprime and is a left inner divisor of it follows from proposition 4 19 that ph 20 1 a 1 right coprime where 1 and a 1 pk 1 b it follows from lemma 4 5 that 4 16 1 p h 1 b since ph 20 it follows from 4 16 that ph 1 b 1 b 1 1 right coprime where b 1 ph 1 b and 1 1 this completes the proof recall that the composition of two inner functions is again an inner function in general we cannot guarantee that the composition of two blaschke products is again a blaschke product however by frostman s theorem ga mar if is an inner function in h then for almost all d with respect to area measure on d the function b is a blaschke product we are now interested in the following question 4 22 let and be inner functions in h suppose and are coprime a if is a finite blaschke product are and coprime b if and are finite blaschke products are and coprime the following example shows that the answer to question 4 22 a is negative example 4 23 let 1 m 1 n d satisfy the following properties a i 6 j for each i j b m i 1 i n j 1 j put m i 1 b i n j 1 b j and b then and are coprime however we have 0 0 0 which implies that and are not coprime to examine question 4 22 b we recall the notion of capacity of zero for a set in d recall cf ga p 78 that a set l d is said to have positive capacity if for some compact subset k l there exists a nonzero positive measure on k such that g z k log 1 b z d is bounded on d 30 4 douglas shapiro shields factorizations the function g z is called the green s potential it is known that every set of positive area has positive capacity so that every set of capacity zero in d has area measure zero on the other hand if h is an inner function then z 0 t is called a singularity of if does not extend analytically from d to z 0 write b s where b is a blaschke product and s is a singular inner function with singular measure it is known ga theorems 6 1 and 6 2 that z 0 is a singularity of if and only if z 0 is an accumulation point of z b or z 0 supp now let f h and let z 0 t then the range set of f at z 0 is defined as r f z 0 r 0 f d z 0 r where z 0 r z z z 0 r thus we can see that the range set is the set of values assumed infinitely often in each neighborhood of z 0 if f is analytic across z 0 and non constant then r f z 0 we recall lemma 4 24 ga theorem 6 6 let be an inner function and let z 0 be a singularity of then r z 0 d l where l is a set of capacity zero moreover if r z 0 then b is a blaschke product as we have remarked a set of capacity zero has area measure zero so that lemma 4 24 shows that d is the range set of an inner function at its singularity except possibly for a set of measure zero we then have theorem 4 25 suppose that and are finite blaschke products if is an inner function satisfying one of the following i is a finite blaschke product ii z z r z 0 z 0 is a singularity of then we have and are coprime and are coprime proof if is a finite blaschke product then obviously and are also finite blaschke products suppose that ii holds it then follows from lemma 4 24 that and are blaschke products observe that 4 17 z z d z z if i or ii holds then it is clear that d z z it thus follows from 4 17 that and are coprime z z z z and are coprime which gives the result 4 douglas shapiro shields factorizations 31 corollary 4 26 suppose that 1 2 n is the set of finite blaschke products if is an inner function satisfying one of the following i is a finite blaschke product ii n i 1 z i r z 0 z 0 is a singularity of then 4 18 g c d k 1 k n 1 g c d k 1 k n 1 proof immediate from theorem 4 25 theorem 4 27 if f h 2 is an outer function and h is an inner function then f is an outer function proof let f be an outer function and be an inner function since f is outer there exists a sequence of polynomials pn such that f pn 1 as n since pn h 2 there exists a sequence of polynomials q m n such that q m n pn as m for each n n we thus have f q m n f pn as m on the other hand since f pn 1 1 as n it follows that 1 cl f pc thus we can conclude that f is outer this completes the proof corollary 4 28 suppose that h then we can write i e inner outer factorization then for an inner function we have i e inner outer factorization proof since i is an inner function it follow from theorem 4 27 on the other hand we may ask what is the relation between the inner parts of the inner outer factorization and the coprime factorization for bounded analytic functions whose conjugates are of bounded type let us consider a simple example take z z 2 then z 1 z 2 inner outer factoriztion z 1 2 z coprime which shows that the degree of the inner part of the inner outer factorization is less than the degree of the inner part of the coprime factorization indeed this is not unexpected in what follows we will show that this phenomenon holds even for matrix valued cases lemma 4 29 ni 1 p 21 let f h 2 mm n n m the following re equivalent 32 4 douglas shapiro shields factorizations a f is an outer function b g c d det f cm i 1 where f cm run through all minors of f in h 2 mm with respect to the canonical bases theorem 4 30 suppose f h 2 m n n m is a rational outer function then for a finite blaschke product h f is an outer function proof suppose f is a rational outer function then by lemma 4 29 4 19 g c d det f cm i 1 since det f cm det f cm det f cm it follows that 4 20 det f cm i det f cm i thus it follows from corollary 4 28 and 4 20 that 4 21 det f cm i det f cm i since f is rational det f cm is also rational it thus follows from 4 19 4 21 and corollary 4 26 that g c d det f cm i g c d det f cm i 1 thus by lemma 4 29 f is an outer function suppose h 2 mn is such that is of bounded type then in view of 4 2 we may write a right coprime now we define the degree of by 4 22 deg dimh since by the beurling lax halmos theorem the right coprime factorization is unique up to a unitary constant right factor it follows that deg is well defined moreover by using the well known fredholm theory of block toeplitz operators do 2 we can see that 4 23 deg dimh deg det we observe that if h 2 mn is an inner matrix function then 4 24 deg is a finite blaschke potapov product thus if h 2 mn then is rational if and only if deg on the other hand the following lemma shows that the notion of degree given in 4 22 is also well defined in the sense that it is independent of the left or the right coprime factorization lemma 4 31 let h 2 mn be such that is of bounded type if ra r right coprime a l l left coprime then dimh r dimh l 4 douglas shapiro shields factorizations 33 proof observe that dimh r dim kerhar r rankhar r rankh lal dim kerh a l l dimh l dimh l where the last equality follows from 4 23 we should not expect that deg deg det for a rational function h 2 mn to see this let z b z 0 1 b z z 1 z then det z so that deg det 1 but can be written as b z 0 0 1 b 0 1 1 a right coprime so that deg deg det deg b z 2 we recall that if h 2 mn define the local rank of by rank max d rank where rank dim cn the following lemma provides an information on the local rank lemma 4 32 cf ni 1 p 44 suppose h 2 mn has the inner outer factor ization i e then cl pcn ih 2 cm where m rank rank i we then have theorem 4 33 suppose h mn then we have a if det 0 then codim rant b if det 6 0 then codim rant rankh proof suppose that has the following inner outer factorization i e i h mn m e h mm n m n since e is an outer function it follows from lemma 4 32 that 4 25 cl rant cl h 2 cn cl pcn ih 2 cm rank m if det 0 then by lemma 4 32 rank i rank m n so that i h mn m thus h i h 2 cn m so that by 4 25 codim rant dim h i which gives a towards b suppose that det 6 0 if is not rational then rankh which gives the result if instead h mn is rational then we may write a left coprime 34 4 douglas shapiro shields factorizations where h mn then deta 6 0 and hence ta is injective thus kert kert ta f h 2 cn t taf 0 ta f t taf 0 ranta kert h therefore codim rant dimkert dimh dim kerh rankh which gives the result corollary 4 34 suppose h mn be such that is of bounded type thus we may write i e inner outer factorization a left coprime if det 6 0 then deg i deg in particular if is a rational function then i is a finite blaschke potapov product proof since det 6 0 it follows from theorem 4 33 that deg i codim rant rankh dimh deg the last assertion is obvious the following example illustrates corollary 4 34 example 4 35 i let z z 0 0 then has the following inner outer factorization z 0 1 1 i e thus we have deg i dim zh 2 0 on the other hand 1 2 2 0 0 0 1 2 z z 1 1 a left coprime thus deg 1 deg i note that det 0 ii let z 0 0 z 2 4 douglas shapiro shields factorizations 35 then we have z 0 0 1 1 0 0 z 2 i e inner outer factorization 1 0 0 1 2 z z 0 0 z a left coprime thus by 4 23 we have deg deg det deg z 2 2 but deg i deg det i deg z 1 corollary 4 36 suppose h mn is a rational function with det 6 0 then for a finite blaschke product we have i e inner outer factorization proof suppose that is a rational function and det 6 0 then by theorem 4 34 i is a finite blaschke potapov product thus i is a finite blaschke potapov product so that by theorem 4 30 we have i e inner outer factorization this completes the proof to proceed we need lemma 4 37 if 1 2 h mn are rational inner functions then the following are equivalent a 1 and 2 are right coprime b ker 1 ker 2 0 for any d proof immediate from chkl corollary 3 2 theorem 4 38 let h mn be a matrix rational function with det 6 0 thus we may write a left coprime where is a finite blaschke potapov product then for a finite blaschke product we have a left coprime proof note that a is rational and deta 6 0 write a aiae inner outer factorization by corollary 4 36 a can be written as 4 26 a ai ae inner outer factorization since and ai are left coprime and hence and a i are right coprime it follows from lemma 4 37 that and a i a i are also right coprime thus and ai are left coprime it thus follows from 4 26 that and a are also left coprime this completes the proof 36 4 douglas shapiro shields factorizations corollary 4 39 let h mn be a matrix rational function of the form a coprime where is a finite blaschke product then for a finite blaschke product we have a coprime proof since i and a are coprime we have by lemma 4 15 deta 6 0 and hence det 6 0 thus the result follows at once from theorem 4 38 theorem 4 40 let h 2 mn be such that is of bounded type thus we may write a right coprime then for a blaschke factor we have a right coprime proof let b be arbitrary blaschke factor suppose that and a are right coprime and assume to the contrary that and a are not right coprime write 1 and a 1 a since 1 and a 1 are not right coprime there exists a nonconstant inner matrix function h mn such that 1 2 and a 1 a 2 2 a 2 h mn note that 1 b put b then is a nonconstant inner matrix function and 1 b 2 b and a a 1 b a 2 b since 2 b and a 2 b are in h mn is a common right inner divisor of and a so that and a are not right coprime a contradiction chapter 5 tensored scalar singularity in this chapter we ask the following question how does one define a singularity for a matrix function of bounded type conventionally the singularity or the pole of matrix l functions is defined by a singularity or a pole of some entry of the matrix functions cf bgr br however when the singularity corresponds to a pole we shall use the opposite convention and say that the matrix l function has a pole of order m at the point d if every nonzero entry has a pole at of order at least m and some entry has a pole of order exactly m this notion of singularity for the pole case is more suitable for our study of toeplitz and hankel operators in this chapter we give a new notion of tensored scalar singularity this new definition takes advantage of the hankel operator as if we were using it to characterize functions of bounded type cf 2 2 this notion contributes to give an answer to the question under what conditions does it follow that if the product of two hankel operators with matrix valued bounded type symbols is zero then either of the operators is zero by our conventions to be defined here 1 z 0 0 1 does not have a singularity at all but 1 z 0 0 1 z 2 has a pole of order 1 at zero to motivate our new idea let us carefully consider the scalar valued case if l is of bounded type then we may write in view of 2 3 5 1 a coprime since a the singularities of come from thus if is a nonconstant inner divisor of then leads to singularities of consequently we can say that has a singularity with respect to if and only if is an inner divisor of if and only if h 2 h 2 in other words 5 2 kerh h 2 h 2 as a new notion of a singularity for a matrix function we now adopt the matrix valued version of the scalar valued case 5 2 definition 5 1 let l mn be of bounded type we say that has a tensored scalar singularity with respect to if there exists a nonconstant inner function such that kerh h 2 cn if is a rational function then in 5 2 is a finite blaschke product so a tensored scalar singularity reduces to a matrix pole cf chkl definition 3 5 37 38 5 tensored scalar singularity hereafter to avoid confusion with the convention we shall call it a tensored scalar pole in particular we say that has a tensored scalar singularity of order p p z if p is the degree of 0 where 0 l c m has a tensored scalar singularity with respect to moreover if 0 b p then we say that has a tensored scalar pole of order p at on the other hand we note that every non analytic bounded type function l has trivially a tensored scalar singularity for if h then by beurling s theorem kerh h 2 for a nonconstant inner function h we also observe lemma 5 2 let l mn be of bounded type and write a right coprime then has a tensored scalar singularity if and only if has a nonconstant diagonal constant inner divisor proof observe that kerh h 2 cn so that kerh h 2 cn h is inner if and only if h 2 cn h 2 cn if and only if i is an inner divisor of in view of lemma 5 2 if l mn has the following coprime factorization b coprime then clearly has a tensored scalar singularity on the other hand it is well known that if l then 5 3 h h 0 h 0 or h 0 but 5 3 may fail for matrix valued functions for example if we take 5 4 1 0 0 z and z 0 0 1 then h h 0 but h 6 0 and h 6 0 we will now try to find a general condition for 5 3 to hold in the matrix valued case to do so we need proposition 5 3 let l mn be of bounded type then has a tensored scalar singularity with respect to if and only if has a tensored scalar singularity with respect to proof write a right coprime in view of lemma 5 2 we may write i 1 1 inner since a and i are right coprime by theorem 4 16 a and i are left coprime so that a and i are right coprime it thus follows from 4 3 that kerh kerh 1 a i kerh a i h 2 cn which implies that has a tensored scalar singularity with respect to for the converse we use the fact and this completes the proof we now have 5 tensored scalar singularity 39 theorem 5 4 let l mn be of bounded type if or has a tensored scalar singularity then h h 0 h 0 or h 0 proof write b left coprime and a right coprime suppose that has a tensored scalar singularity by lemma 5 2 there exists a nonconstant inner function such that 1 1 inner suppose h h 0 since and b are right coprime it follows from 4 3 that 5 5 h i h kerh kerh h 2 cn write ij n i j 1 since is not constant h has at least an outer function that is invertible in h cf chl 1 lemma 3 4 it thus follows from 5 5 that 0 0 t h 2 cn which implies 1 j h 2 for each j 1 n similarly we can show that ij h 2 for each i j 1 2 n so that ij 1 h 2 h 2 for each i j 1 2 n therefore each ij is constant and hence is a constant unitary therefore h 2 mn which gives h 0 if instead has a tensored scalar singularity then by proposition 5 3 has a tensored scalar singularity thus if h h 0 then h h 0 so that h h 0 by what we proved just above we observe that if l mn is normal then by 2 9 t t h h h h on the other hand we recall ghr theorem 3 3 gu 2 corollary 2 that if l mn then 5 6 h h h h k h mn such that k 1 and k h mn the following theorem is of independent interest theorem 5 5 let l mn be of bounded type if or has a tensored scalar singularity then h h h h u h mn for some unitary constant matrix u mn proof write a right coprime if has a tensored scalar singularity then by lemma 5 2 has an inner divisor of the form i with a nonconstant inner function thus we may write 1 for an inner matrix function 1 h mn it follows that a and i are right coprime 40 5 tensored scalar singularity so that by theorem 4 16 a and i are left coprime and hence a and i are right coprime thus 5 7 kerh kerh kerh 1 a kerh a h 2 cn if h h h h then kerh kerh h 2 cn which implies that also has a tensored scalar singularity therefore without loss of generality we may assume that has a tensored scalar singularity since h h h h we have h h h h then by 5 6 there exist u u h mn with u 1 and u 1 such that 5 8 u h 2 mn and u h 2 mn it follows from 5 8 that uu h 2 mn so that h huu 0 and hence i t u u h 0 which together with 5 7 implies 5 9 h i ranh ker i t u u thus we have f t u u f for each f h i but since u u uu 1 we should have u u f h 2 cn so that f u u f for each f h i thus uu is constant and actually uu in therefore u is a unitary constant and by 5 8 u h mn the converse is evident for a l 2 mn and an inner matrix function h 2 mn we define ta ph ta h that is ta f ph af for each f h note that ta is densely de fined and possibly unbounded however ta may be bounded under certain conditions to see this let bmo mn ij l 2 mn ij bmo we then have lemma 5 6 let a h 2 mn and h mn be an inner matrix function if g a h 2 mn bmo mn then ta is bounded proof since g bmo mn we can find a matrix function f h 2 mn such that g f l mn cf pe theorem 1 3 thus l mn observe that ph t h ph t a f h ph ta f h ph ta h ta which implies ta is bounded in view of lemma 5 6 ta is understood in the sense that the compres sion ta is bounded even though ta is possibly unbounded if a h 2 mn bmo mn in particular we are interested in the case a for a matrix function l mn 5 tensored scalar singularity 41 here we pause to ask when is ta injective first of all we take a look at possible cases when n 2 i let a 0 1 0 0 and z 0 0 1 put f 1 0 t then f h af 0 and ta f 0 thus ta is not injective ii let a 0 1 0 0 and 1 0 0 z put f 0 1 t then f h af 1 0 t 6 0 and ta f 0 thus ta is not injective iii let a z 1 0 1 and b z 0 0 z where z 1 2 1 z put f b 0 t then f h af zb 0 t 6 0 and ta f 0 thus ta is not injective note that has a tensored scalar singularity and a b 0 z z h 2 m 2 note that a and are not right coprime we observe lemma 5 7 let a h 2 mn and let h mn be an inner function such that a b h 2 mn bmo mn where and b are right coprime then ker ta h h 2 cn in particular if has a tensored scalar singularity with respect to then ker ta i h 1 with 1 proof let f h then we have ta f 0 b f af h 2 cn f kerhb h 2 cn which implies ker ta h h 2 cn suppose that has a tensored scalar singularity with respect to then by lemma 5 2 we may write i 1 and i 1 where 1 and 1 are inner we thus have ker ta h h 2 cn h i h 2 cn h i i h 1 i h 2 cn i h 1 which gives the result 42 5 tensored scalar singularity corollary 5 8 let a h 2 mn and i h mn for an inner function such that a h 2 mn bmo mn if a and are coprime then ta is injective in particular if is a finite blaschke product then ta is invertible proof since a and i are coprime it follows that a a coprime it thus follows from lemma 5 7 that ker ta h h 2 cn 0 which implies that ta is injective if is a finite blaschke product then ta is a finite dimensional operator and it follows that ta is invertible theorem 5 9 let a h 2 mn and let i h mn for an inner function such that a h 2 mn bmo mn if a and are coprime then ta has a linear inverse possibly unbounded proof by corollary 5 8 ta is injective thus it suffices to show that ta is injective observe that for u v h ta u v au v t tr a v u d u a v which implies 5 10 ta ta on the contrary assume that ta is not injective then there exists a nonzero vector f h such that 0 ta f ph a f which gives a f h 2 cn since i and f h it follows that a f a f h 2 cn h 2 cn 0 which implies that a f 0 since a and are coprime it follows from lemma 4 15 that a is invertible and hence f 0 a contradiction this proves ta is injective remark 5 10 from lemma 5 7 we can see that if a h 2 mn and h mn is an inner matrix function such that a b h 2 mn bmo mn where and b are right coprime then 5 11 ta is injective but 5 11 does not hold in general if 6 for example let a 0 1 0 0 and z 0 0 1 then a 0 0 z 0 1 0 0 z 0 1 0 0 b note that and b are right coprime it thus follows from lemma 5 7 that ker ta h h 2 cn c 0 6 0 5 tensored scalar singularity 43 which implies that ta is not injective here we note that and a are not right coprime and deta 0 thus we may expect that if 1 and a are right coprime 2 deta 6 0 then ta is injective although 6 however this is not the case for example let a 0 1 1 0 and z 0 0 1 then a 0 1 z 0 1 0 0 z 0 1 1 0 a note that and a are right coprime it thus follows from lemma 5 7 that ker ta h h 2 cn c 0 6 0 which implies that ta is not injective note that and a are right coprime and deta 6 0 chapter 6 an interpolation problem and a functional calculus in this chapter we consider both an interpolation problem for matrix functions of bounded type and a functional calculus for compressions of the shift operator we first review the classical hermite feje r interpolation problem following ff let be a finite blaschke product of degree d ei n i 1 bi mi b i z z i 1 iz where i d where d n i 1 mi for our purposes rewrite in the form ei d j 1 bj where bj b k if k 1 l 0 ml j k l 0 ml and for notational convenience set m 0 0 let 6 1 j qj 1 jz bj 1 bj 2 b 1 1 j d where 1 q 1 1 1 z 1 and qj 1 j 2 1 2 1 j d it is well known cf ta that j dj 1 is an orthonormal basis for h for our purposes we concentrate on the data given by sequences of n n complex matrices given the sequence kij 1 i n 0 j mi of n n complex matrices and a set of distinct complex numbers 1 n in d the classical hermite feje r interpolation problem entails finding necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a contractive analytic matrix function k in h mn satisfying 6 2 k j i j ki j 1 i n 0 j mi to construct a matrix polynomial k z p z satisfying 6 2 let pi z be the polynomial of order d mi defined by pi z n k 1 k 6 i z k i k mk 45 46 6 an interpolation problem and a functional calculus consider the matrix polynomial p z of degree d 1 defined by 6 3 p z n i 1 k i

let w be the unitary operator from d 1 c n onto h i defined by 6 4 w i 1 i 2 i d where the j are the functions in 6 1 it is known ff theorem x 1 5 that if is the finite blaschke product of order d then u is unitarily equivalent to the lower triangular matrix m on cd defined by 6 5 m 1 0 0 0 q 1 q 2 2 0 0 q 1 1 q 3 q 2 q 3 3 0 q 1 2 3 q 4 q 2 3 q 4 q 3 q 4 4 q 1 2 3 4 q 5 q 2 3 4 q 5 q 3 4 q 5 q 4 q 5 5 now let p z h mn be a matrix polynomial of degree k then the matrix p m on cn d is defined by 6 6 p m k i 0 pi m i where p z k i 0 piz i ifm is given by 6 5 and p is the matrix polynomial defined by 6 3 then the matrix p m is called the hermite feje r matrix determined by 6 6 in particular if tp ph tp h is the compression of tp to h where i for an inner function cf p 12 then it is known ff theorem x 5 6 that 6 7 w tp w p m which says that p m is a matrix representation for tp we now consider an interpolation problem for matrix functions of bounded type our interpolation problem involves a certain matrix valued functional equa tion k h mn where l mn and k h mn is unknown we may ask when does there exist such a matrix h function k if such a function k exists how do we find it if is a matrix valued rational function this interpolation problem reduces to the classical hermite feje r interpolation problem more concretely we consider the following question for l mn when does there exist a function k h mn satisfying k h mn 6 an interpolation problem and a functional calculus 47 for notational convenience we write for l mn c k h mn k h mn thus question can be rewritten as for l mn 6 8 when is c nonempty question 6 8 resembles an interpolation problem as we will see below in this chapter we consider question 6 8 for matrix functions of bounded type if c 6 i e there exists a functionk h mn such that k h 2 mn then h t k h for some k h mn which implies kerh kerh thus we have 6 9 c 6 kerh kerh let l mn be such that and are of bounded type in view of 4 2 we may write 6 10 1 a and 2 b right coprime thus if c 6 then by 6 9 and 4 3 1 h 2 cn 2 h 2 cn it then follows cf ff corollary ix 2 2 that 2 is a left inner divisor of 1 therefore whenever we consider the interpolation problem 6 8 for a function l mn such that and are of bounded type we may assume that l mn is of the form 6 11 0 1 a and 0 b right coprime on the other hand if l mn is such that and are of bounded type then in view of 2 7 we may also write 6 12 1 a and 2 b where 1 2 h are inner functions if c 6 then we can also show that 2 is an inner divisor of 1 even though the factorizations in 6 12 are not right coprime cf chl 2 proposition 3 2 thus if l mn is such that and are of bounded type then we may without loss of generality assume that is of the form 6 13 0 1 a and 0 b where 0 1 h mn are inner functions and a b h 2 mn in view of lemma 5 2 we may also assume that the pairs i 0 1 a and i 0 b have no common tensored scalar singularity first of all we consider the case of matrix valued rational functions l mn in this case we may write 1 0 a and 1 b where 0 1 h are finite blaschke products observe that 6 14 k c k h mn 0 b ka 1 0 h 2 mn write 1 0 z n i 1 z i 1 iz mi d n i 1 mi 48 6 an interpolation problem and a functional calculus i e 1 0 is a finite blaschke product of degree d then the last assertion in 6 14 holds if and only if the following equations hold for each i 1 n 6 15 bi 0 bi 1 bi 2 bi mi 1 ki 0 0 0 0 ki 1 ki 0 0 0 ki 2 ki 1 ki 0 0 ki mi 1 ki mi 2 ki 1 ki 0 ai 0 ai 1 ai 2 ai mi 1 where ki j k j i j ai j a j i j and bi j 0 b j i j thus k is a function in h mn for which 6 16 k j i j ki j 1 i n 0 j mi where the ki j are determined by the equation 6 15 this is exactly the classical hermite feje r interpolation problem therefore the solution 6 3 for the classical hermite feje r interpolation problem provides a polynomial k c we turn our attention to the case of matrix functions of bounded type to proceed we need proposition 6 1 let l mn be such that and are of bounded type in view of 6 11 we may write 0 1 a and 0 b right coprime suppose 1 a a 1 where a 1 and are left coprime then the following hold a if k c then k k for some k h mn b if i is an inner divisor of 1 then i is an inner divisor of and 6 17 c 1 k k c where 1 ph 20 cf p 12 proof observe that k c b 0 ka 1 0 h 2 mn b 1 ka h 2 mn 0 1 which implies that ka h 2 mn 1 and hence ka 1 h 2 mn let 1 a a 1 where a 1 and are left coprime then 6 18 0 hka 1 hk a 1 tk h a 1 since a 1 and are left coprime a 1 and are right coprime so that ranh a 1 h thus by 6 18 k h h 2 cn so that k k for some k h mn which implies k k this proves a for b suppose i is an inner divisor of 1 thus we may write 1 1 i for some inner function 1 now we will show that i is an inner divisor of since 1 a a 1 we have hai h a 1 1 and hence kerh a 1 1 h 2 cn thus we may write a 1 1 d i i d coprime 6 an interpolation problem and a functional calculus 49 which implies that i is an inner divisor of write i thus if k c then by a k h 2 mn which implies 1 k 1 h 2 mn thus we have k k c 1 which implies that k k c c 1 the above argument is reversible and this proves 6 17 corollary 6 2 let l mn be of bounded type of the form 0 1 a and 0 b coprime where 0 and 1 are finite blaschke products and a b h 2 mn if is an inner divisor of 1 then 6 19 c k k c 1 proof immediate from proposition 6 1 now let h mn be an inner matrix function and suppose n i 1 i i is an inner matrix function write j j i 1 i j 1 n 1 then by lemma 4 6 a we have k k n k n 1 n k n k n 1 k n 2 n 1 n k n k n 1 n k n 2 k n 3 n 2 n 1 n k n k n 1 n

view of 6 13 0 1 a and 0 b where 0 1 are inner functions and a b h 2 mn we may assume that 0 0 thus in view of lemma 4 4 a k 0 1 and b k 0 let 0 n i 1 i i h is inner 50 6 an interpolation problem and a functional calculus then by 6 20 and lemma 4 6 a we may write 6 21 a a 1 n i 2 n j n 2 i j ai 0 an 1 b b 1 n i 2 n j n 2 i j bi where ai bi k n 1 i i 1 2 n and an 1 k 1 we then have lemma 6 3 let l

j i 2 3 n an 1 k 1 and ai bi k n 1 i suppose that a and i 1 are coprime then for k h mn k c pk 0 1 k 1 n i 1 iki where ki k n 1 i i 1 2 n satisfies the equation 6 22 n i 1 ibi n i 1 iki n i 1 iai 0 h 2 mn proof suppose that a and i 1 are coprime let k c if we put 1 1 then by proposition 6 1 b we can show that k 1 k for some k c it thus suffices to show that 6 23 k c pk 0 k n i 1 iki where ki k n 1 i i 1 2 n 1 satisfies the equation 6 22 by lemma 4 4 we have ph 20 1 0 pk 0 a 0 n i 1 iai then 6 24 k h 2 mn n i 1 ibi k n i 1 iai 0 h 2 mn pk 0 n i 1 ibi pk 0 k n i 1 iai 0 n i 1 ibi pk 0 pk 0 k n i

ibi n i 1 iki n i 1 iai 0 h 2 mn which gives 6 23 this completes the proof theorem 6 4 let l mn be of bounded type of the form na and mb n m where is inner then in view of 6 21 we may write a a 0 m 1 i 1 iai mam and b b 0 m 1 i 1 ibi where am k n m and ai bi k i 0 1 m 1 suppose that a and i are coprime then for k h mn k c pk n k n m k 0 m 1 i 1 iki where the ki k satisfy the equation 6 25 b 0 b 1

where g 0 p h 2 mn d 0 and gk ph 2 mn dk 1 p h 2 mn dk this argument is reversible this completes the proof theorem 6 5 let l mn be normal of the form na and mb n m where is inner and i and b are

by lemma 4 15 b 0 is invertible a e on t now we will show that 6 30 a 0 is invertible a e on t since i m and b are coprime it follows that kerh mh 2 cn since c 6 it follows from proposition 6 1 b that c 1 n m 6 thus we have 6 31 mh 2 cn kerh kerh 1 n m 6 an interpolation problem and a functional calculus 53 observe that 1 n m m pk ma m a 0 m 1 i 1 iai it thus follows from 6 31 that a 0 and i are

turn our attention to a functional calculus for compressions of the shift operator it is well known that the functional calculus for polynomials of compressions of the shift results in the hermite feje r matrix via the classical hermite feje r inter polation problem we now extend the polynomial calculus to an h functional calculus so called the sz nagy foias functional calculus via the triangulariza tion theorem and then extend it further to an h h functional calculus for compressions of the shift operator first of all we extend the representation 6 7 to the case of matrix h functions we refer to ac and ni 1 for details on this representation for an explicit criterion we need to introduce the triangularization theorem concretely there are three cases to consider case 1 let b be a blaschke product and let n n 1 be the sequence of zeros of b counted with their multiplicities write 1 1 k k 1 n 1 n z 1 nz n n k 2 and let j dj 1 jz j j 1 where dj 1 j 2 1 2 let b be the measure on n given by b n 1 2 d 2 n n n then the map vb l 2 b h b defined by 6 32 vb c 1 2 n 1 c n dn n c c n n 1 is unitary and ub is mapped onto the operator 6 33 v bubvb i jb mb where mbc n nc n n n is a multiplication operator and jbc n n 1 k 1 c k k 2 n 0 k 0 dkdn n n is a lower triangular hilbert schmidt operator case 2 let s be a singular inner function with continuous representing measure s let be the projection of onto the arc t 0 arg arg and let s exp t t t d t d 54 6 an interpolation problem and a functional calculus then the map vs l 2 h s defined by 6 34 vsc 2 t c s d d is unitary and us is mapped onto the operator 6 35 v s usvs i js ms where msc c t is a multiplication operator and jsc 2 t e t c t d t t is a lower triangular hilbert schmidt operator case 3 let be a singular inner function with pure point representing measure we enumerate the set t t t 0 as a sequence tk k n write k tk k 1 further let be a measure on r 0 such that d 1 d and define a function on the unit disk d by the formula 0 1 exp k 1 k tk tk 1 t 1 t 1 where is the integer part of r then the map v l 2 h defined by 6 36 v c 2 r c 1 t 1 1 d d is unitary and u is mapped onto the operator 6 37 v u v i j m where m c t 1 c r is a multiplication operator and j c 2 0 c t 0 t 0 d t r is a lower triangular hilbert schmidt operator collecting together the above three cases we get triangularization theorem ni 1 p 123 let be an inner function with the canonical factorization b s where b is a blaschke product and s and are singular inner functions with representing measures s and respectively with s continuous and a pure point measure then the map v l 2 b l 2 s l 2 h defined by 6 38 v vb 0 0 0 bvs 0 0 0 bsv is unitary where vb b vs s v are defined in 6 32 6 37 and u is mapped onto the operator 6 39 m v u v mb 0 0 0 ms 0 0 0 m j 6 an interpolation problem and a functional calculus 55 where mb ms m are defined in 6 33 6 35 and 6 37 and j jbmb 0 0 0 jsms 0 0 0 j m a is a lower triangular hilbert schmidt operator with a 3 0 ranka 3 now we note that every compression of the shift operator is completely non unitary cf chl 2 proof of theorem 3 3 therefore if m is given by 6 39 then m is an absolutely continuous contraction thus if h mn then we can define m as a h functional calculus the so called sz nagy foias functional calculus then we have theorem 6 6 let h mn and let h be an inner function if we write 6 40 m v u v and v v in where v l l 2 b l 2 s l 2 h is unitary as in 6 38 then 6 41 v t v m i remark 6 7 m is called a matrix representation for t proof of theorem 6 6 if z rs z 1 r s n h mn we may write z i 0 aiz i ai mn we also write rs z 0 a rs i z i and then ai a rs i 1 r s n we thus have t ph t h i 0 u i a rs i 1 r s n i 0 u i ai let j be an orthonormal basis for h and put ej v j then ej forms an orthonormal basis for l 2 b l 2 s l 2 thus for each f cn we have v ej f j f it thus follows that t j f k g i 0 m i ai ej f ek g m ej f ek g which gives v t v m we can now extend the representation 6 41 to h mn h mn where h mn denotes the set of n n matrix functions whose entries belong to h g g h let q h mn h mn be of the form q q q if i for an inner function then we define tq ph tq h 56 6 an interpolation problem and a functional calculus then tq tq tq tq tq by 5 10 if m v u v where v l l 2 b l 2 s l 2 h is unitary as in 6 38 we also define q m by 6 42 q m q m q m where q m is defined by the sz nagy foias functional calculus we then have lemma 6 8 let q h mn h mn and i for an inner function then a v tq v q m b q m q m where v and m are given by 6 40 proof it follows from theorem 6 6 that v tq v v tq tq v q m q m q m which gives a by definition of q m we have q m q m q m q m q m q m q m q m which gives b we are tempted to guess that q m q m q q m but this is not the case to see this let z 3 and let q z z 2 0 0 z 2 then we have m 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 and q m 1 0 0 1 m 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 thus q m q m 1

following lemma shows that the operator induced by q in 6 42 is closed under constant matrix multiplication 6 an interpolation problem and a functional calculus 57 lemma 6 9 let q h mn h mn and and i for an inner function then for any constant matrix mn a q m i q m b q m q m i where m is given by 6 40 proof let us write q z j qjz j since is a constant matrix q z j qjz j thus for each u w h i q m v u v w j i qj m j v u v w j qj m j v u v w q m v u v w where v is given by 6 40 this proves a observe that q m q m by lemma 6 8 b q m i q m by a i q m by lemma 6 8 b q m i which gives b chapter 7 abrahamse s theorem for matrix valued symbols in 1970 p r halmos posed the following problem listed as problem 5 in his lecture ten problems in hilbert space hal 1 hal 2 is every subnormal toeplitz operator either normal or analytic a toeplitz operator t is called analytic if h any analytic toeplitz opera tor is easily seen to be subnormal indeed t h p h h m h for h h 2 where m is the normal operator of multiplication by on l 2 the question is natural because normal and analytic toeplitz operators are fairly well understood and they are both subnormal in 1984 halmos problem 5 was answered in the negative by c cowen and j long col however cowen and long s construc tion does not provide an intrinsic connection between subnormality and the theory of toeplitz operators until now researchers have been unable to characterize sub normal toeplitz operators in terms of their symbols in this sense we reformulate halmos problem 5 which toeplitz operators are subnormal the most interesting partial answer to halmos problem 5 was given by m b abrahamse ab who gave a general sufficient condition for the answer to halmos problem 5 to be affirmative abrahamse s theorem ab theorem let l be such that or is of bounded type if i t is hyponormal ii ker t t is invariant under t then t is normal or analytic consequently if l is such that or is of bounded type then every subnormal toeplitz operator must be either normal or analytic since ker s s is invariant under s for every subnormal operator s it is actually sufficient to assume that s is 2 hyponormal we say that a block toeplitz operator t is analytic if h mn evidently any analytic block toeplitz operator with a normal symbol is subnormal because the multiplication operator m is a normal extension of t as a first inquiry in the above reformulation of halmos problem 5 the following question can be raised is abrahamse s theorem valid for toeplitz operators with matrix valued symbols in general a straightforward matrix valued version of abrahamse s theorem is doomed to fail for instance if z z 0 0 z 59 60 7 abrahamse s theorem for matrix valued symbols then clearly both and are of bounded type and t u u 0 0 u where u is the shift on h 2 is subnormal but neither normal nor analytic in this chapter we extend the above result to the case of bounded type symbols we shall say that t has a bounded type symbol if both and are of bounded type recently it was shown in chl 1 that if l mn is such that and are of bounded type of the form 7 1 b coprime and if t is hyponormal and ker t t is invariant under t then t is normal or analytic however the condition 7 1 forces the inner part of the right coprime factorization 4 2 of to be diagonal constant also it was shown in chkl that if is a matrix valued rational function then the condition 7 1 can be weak ened to the condition that the inner part of the right coprime factorization 4 2 of has a nonconstant diagonal constant inner divisor we note that in view of lemma 5 2 those conditions of chl 1 and chkl are special cases of the condi tion of having a tensored scalar singularity indeed in this chapter we will show that for a bounded type symbols l mn if has a tensored scalar singularity then we get a full fledged matrix valued version of abrahamse s theorem to proceed we need the following result lemma 7 1 let l mn be such that is of bounded type if t is hyponormal then there exists an inner function such that ran t t h i proof if is of bounded type then in view of 2 6 a i a h 2 mn if t is hyponormal then by lemma 2 3 is normal thus by 2 9 t t h h h h thus if t is hyponormal then kerh kerh and hence kerh ker t t which gives h 2 cn ker t t or ran t t h the following lemma shows what tensored scalar singularities do in the passage from hyponormality to subnormality lemma 7 2 let l mn be such that is of bounded type suppose t is hyponormal thus in view of lemma 7 1 there exists an inner function i h mn a nonconstant scalar inner function such that ran t t h if has a tensored scalar singularity then t is normal proof by assumption h 2 cn ker t t if t is hyponormal then by lemma 2 3 is normal thus by 2 9 we have 0 t t t t t t t t t h h t h h h h h h 7 abrahamse s theorem for matrix valued symbols 61 thus if has a tensored scalar singularity then it follows from theorem 5 5 that 7 2 u h mn for some unitary constant u mn since t is hyponormal by lemma 2 3 there exists a matrix function k h mn such that k h mn thus it follows from 7 2 that uk h mn so that i t u k h 0 which gives 7 3 ranh ker i t u k on the other hand since has a tensored scalar singularity it follows that kerh h 2 cn nonconstant inner thus by lemma 5 2 we can write b right coprime we thus have b since i and b are right coprime it follows from theorem 4 16 that i and b are left coprime so that i and b are right coprime we then have kerh kerh h 2 cn which together with 7 3 implies h i cl ranh ker i t u k the same argument as the one used right after 5 9 in theorem 5 5 shows that uk i and hence k u is a constant unitary therefore t t h i t k t k h 0 this completes the proof the main theorem of this chapter now follows theorem 7 3 abrahamse s theorem for matrix valued symbols let l mn be such that and are of bounded type assume has a tensored scalar singularity if i t is hyponormal ii ker t t is invariant under t then t is normal hence in particular if t is subnormal then t is normal proof suppose t is hyponormal and ker t t is invariant under t let and be of bounded type thus in view of 4 2 we may write b right coprime suppose has a tensored scalar singularity so that by lemma 5 2 has a non constant diagonal constant inner function i thus 1 for some inner matrix function 1 since t is hyponormal we may write in view of 6 11 2 a right coprime where 2 is an inner matrix function since by lemma 2 3 is normal it follows from 2 9 that 7 4 t t h a 2 ha 2 h b hb which implies 2 h 2 cn ker t t ran t t so that 7 5 ran t t h 2 62 7 abrahamse s theorem for matrix valued symbols we first suppose ran t t h 1 2 since kerh 1 2 kerh a h 2 cn so that 1 2 has a tensored scalar singularity it follows from lemma 7 2 with 1 2 that t is normal we thus suppose that ran t t is not contained in h 1 2 in this case we assume to the contrary that t is not normal in view of lemma 7 1 there exists a diagonal constant inner function i such that 7 6 ran t t h or equivalently ran t t h 2 cn by lemma 7 2 has no tensored scalar singularity but since a 2 1 it follows from lemma 5 2 that is an inner divisor of let h ran t t be an arbitrary vector since by assumption ker t t is invariant for t we have t ran t t ran t t and hence t h ran t t from 7 6 h h 2 cn thus we have h 1 b h h 1 b h h 2 cn since by 7 6 h h 2 cn it follows that 7 7 b h h 2 cn since b zh 2 mn we can choose b k thus by lemma 4 6 we may write 7 8 b b 1 b 2 where b 1 k 1 and b 2 k then it follows from 7 7 and 7 8 that b 1 h b 2 h h 2 cn so that b 2 h h 2 cn we thus have 7 9 z b 2 h h 2 cn or equivalently h kerh z b 2 we now claim that 7 10 h z h 2 cn to see this we first suppose that and z are not coprime then z is an inner divisor of since b and are right coprime it follows from theorem 4 16 that b and i are coprime and hence b and iz are coprime thus by 7 8 b 2 and iz are coprime therefore b 2 and iz are coprime which implies that by 4 3 together with 7 9 h kerh z b 2 z h 2 cn giving 7 10 suppose now that and z are coprime then by 4 3 and 7 9 we have 7 11 h kerh z b 2 kerh b 2 h 2 cn but since h h 2 cn and hence h zh 2 cn we have h h 2 cn zh 2 cn z h 2 cn giving 7 10 now by 7 10 we have z h h 2 cn so that h h 2 cn therefore we can see that h h 2 cn for each h ran t t 7 abrahamse s theorem for matrix valued symbols 63 which implies that ran t t h h i thus we can repeat the above argument with in place of in 7 6 then induction on p shows that ran t t h i p for all p z in particular p h 2 and hence p is an inner divisor of for all p z thus it follows from lemma 4 13 that h 2 p 1 ph 2 0 a contradiction therefore t should be normal this proves the first assertion the second assertion follows at once from the fact that if t is subnormal then ker t t is invariant for t this completes the proof of theorem 7 3 remark 7 4 a we note that the assumption has a tensored scalar singu larity is essential in theorem 7 3 as we saw before if z z 0 0 z then t is neither normal nor analytic but since kerh kerh z 00 0 z 00 1 h 2 cn it follows that z 00 1 does not have any nonconstant diagonal constant inner divisor so that does not have a tensored scalar singularity b if n 1 then h is vacuously diagonal constant so that theorem 7 3 reduces to the original abrahamse s theorem we will next give an example that illustrates theorem 7 3 to do so we need some auxiliary observations if l mn is such that and are of bounded type and for which t is hyponormal we will in view of 4 1 and 6 13 assume that 7 12 a 1 2 and b 2 left coprime where 1 2 i lemma 7 5 let l mn be such that and are of bounded type then in view of 7 12 we may write a 0 2 and b 2 left coprime where 0 2 i with an inner function if t is hyponormal and ker t t is invariant under t then 7 13 0 h 2 cn ker t t moreover if k c then 7 14 cl ranha 2 ker i tk t k proof the inclusion 7 13 follows from a slight extension of chl 2 theo rem 3 5 in which 2 is a diagonal constant inner function of the form 2 i 2 however a careful analysis of chl 2 proof of theorem 3 5 step 1 shows that the proof does not employ the diagonal constancy of 2 but uses only the diagonal constancy of 0 2 towards 7 14 we observe that if k c then by 2 10 7 15 t t h h h k hk h i t k t k h 64 7 abrahamse s theorem for matrix valued symbols so that ker t t ker i tk t k h thus by 7 13 0 i t k t k ha 2 0 0 h 2 cn i t k t k ha 2 h 2 cn giving 7 14 in ghr the normality of block toeplitz operator t was also characterized in terms of the symbol under a determinant condition on the symbol lemma 7 6 normality of block toeplitz operators ghr let be normal and 0 0 if det 6 0 then 7 16 t is normal 0 u for some constant unitary matrix u we then have example 7 7 let l be of bounded type and consider b b d where b is a blaschke factor of the form b z z 1 z in view of 2 3 we may write 0 a and 1 b coprime if 0 0 and 1 6 0 then t is never subnormal proof write b b b b 0 0 and assume that t is subnormal since by lemma 2 3 is normal a straightfor ward calculation shows that 7 17 also there exists a matrix function k k 1 k 2 k 3 k 4 e i e k 1 such that k h m 2 thus since k h 2 m 2 and hence b 0 a 1 b b k 2 k 1 k 4 k 3 h 2 m 2 we have 7 18 b k 2 h 2 1 b k 4 h 2 b k 3 h 2 0 a k 1 h 2 which via cowen s theorem gives that the following toeplitz operators are all hyponormal 7 19 t b t 1 b t b t 0 a note that is not identically zero so that det is not put 0 b m 0 m 1 0 6 0 note a 6 0 because 0 0 and 0 and a are coprime then a straightforward calculation together with 7 14 shows that 7 20 m 1 7 abrahamse s theorem for matrix valued symbols 65 thus we may write by a direct calculation 0 a b b 1 0 0 0 b 1 b 2 left coprime but since 2 0 0 0 b 1 has a diagonal inner divisor ib it follows from the orem 7 3 that t is normal since det 6 0 it follows form lemma 7 6 that 0 u for some constant unitary matrix u c 1 c 2 c 3 c 4 we observe 0 u 0 b 1 3 d 0 2 c 0 b 1 b 0 a b c 1 c 2 c 3 c 4 0 c 1 b c

this chapter we consider a subnormal toeplitz completion problem given a partially specified operator matrix with some known entries the prob lem of finding suitable operators to complete the given partial operator matrix so that the resulting matrix satisfies certain given properties is called a completion problem a subnormal completion of a partial operator matrix is a particular spec ification of the unspecified entries resulting in a subnormal operator a partial block toeplitz matrix is simply an n n matrix some of whose entries are speci fied toeplitz operators and whose remaining entries are unspecified a subnormal toeplitz completion of a partial block toeplitz matrix is a subnormal completion whose unspecified entries must be toeplitz operators we now consider problem 8 1 let b be a blaschke factor of the form b z z 1 z d complete the unspecified toeplitz entries of the partial block toeplitz matrix a t b t b d to make a subnormal recently in chl 2 we have considered problem 8 1 for the cases 0 the solution given in chl 2 theorem 5 1 relies upon very intricate and long computations using the symbol involved however our solution in this chapter provides a shorter and more insightful proof by employing the results of the previous chapter we now give an answer to problem 8 1 theorem 8 2 let l and consider a t b t t tb d the following statements are equivalent a a is normal b a is subnormal c a is 2 hyponormal except in the following special case 8 1 b 0 a and b 1 b coprime with ab 0 1 6 0 however unless only one of 0 and 1 is constant the exceptional case 8 1 implies that if a is subnormal then either a is normal or a is quasinormal for some c 67 68 8 a subnormal toeplitz completion proof clearly a b and b c c a write b b b b 0 0 and assume that t is 2 hyponormal since ker t t is invariant under t for every 2 hyponormal operator t b h cf cul 2 we note that theorem 7 3 holds for 2 hyponormal operators t under the same assumption on the symbol if t is hyponormal then by lemma 2 3 there exists a matrix function k k 1 k 2 k 3 k 4 h m 2 such that k 1 and k h m 2 i e 8 2 b b k 1 k 2 k 3 k 4 0 0 h 2 m 2 which implies that 8 3 h b hk 2 h tk 2 and hb hk 3 h tk 3 if is not of bounded type then kerh 0 so that k 2 0 a contradiction and if is not of bounded type then kerh 0 so that k 3 0 a contradic tion thus since and are of bounded type it follows that of bounded type since t is hyponormal it follows from 2 13 that is also of bounded type thus we can write 0 a and 1 b coprime since is normal i e a straightforward calculation shows that thus by 8 2 we have 8 4 b k 2 h 2 0 a k 1 h 2 b k 3 h 2 1 b k 4 h 2 which implies that the following toeplitz operators are all hyponormal via cowen s theorem 8 5 t b t 1 b t b t 0 a put 0 b m 0 and 1 b n 1 m n 0 0 6 0 1 6 0 by example 7 7 if m 6 0 and n 0 then we get a contradiction also a similar argument to example 7 7 shows that either m n 0 or m n 1 thus we have to consider the case m n 0 and the case m n 1 case a m n 0 a straightforward calculation shows that kerh h 2 c 2 where b 1 0 0 b 0 since has a diagonal constant inner divisor ib it follows from lemma 5 2 and theorem 7 3 that t is normal 8 a subnormal toeplitz completion 69 case b 1 m n 1 ab 6 0 1 a straightforward calculation shows that kerh h 2 c 2 where b 1 0 0 b 0 since has a diagonal constant inner divisor ib it follows from lemma 5 2 and theorem 7 3 that t is normal case b 2 m n 1 ab 0 1 a straightforward calculation shows that kerh 2 h 2 c 2 where 2 0 1 0 1 b 0 1 a 1 2 1 thus we can write b 0 a 1 b b 2 b right coprime so that 8 6 b 1 b 0 a b b 2 left coprime by a scalar valued version of 6 13 and 8 5 we can see that 1 3 d and 0 2 c for some inner functions 2 3 where d h z 1 3 and c h z 0 2 thus in particular c 6 0 and d 6 0 let 2 b q 2 and 3 b p 3 where 2 6 0 6 3 if we write 0 2 a 0 2 i for an inner function then a straightfor ward calculation shows that a 0 1 3 c 0 2 d 0 we thus have 8 7 ha 2 1 0 h b 3 c h b 2 d it was known that ranh b h b 1 where 1 1 2 1 z it thus follows from 8 7 that 8 8 1 1 cl ranha 2 ker i t k t k where 6 0 we observe that if k h 2 then 8 9 tk z 1 k 1 indeed if k h 2 and n 0 then k z 1 zn 1 k z zn k zn 1 1 2 k n 1 2 k n 70 8 a subnormal toeplitz completion so that tk z 1 p k z 1 1 2 k n 0 nzn k 1 2 1 z k 1 which proves 8 9 thus a straightforward calculation together with 8 8 shows that 8 10 1 k 1 2 k 3 1 and 1 k 2 2 k 4 where 1 k 1 k 2 and 2 k 3 k 4 we also have from 8 8 8 11 1 1 2 t k 1 1 2 k 1 k 2 1 k 3 k 4 1 2 1 1 2 1 2 which implies 8 12 1 2 1 2 2 2 from 8 4 we can see that 8 13 k 1 2 k 1 k 2 1 3 k 2 k 3 0 2 k 3 k 4 3 k 4 where k i h for i 1 4 thus by 8 10 and 8 13 we can see that 2 and 3 are both constant without loss of generality we may assume that 2 3 1 we next claim that 8 14 0 1 b i e 0 and 1 are both constant by our assumption if 0 or 1 is constant then both 0 and 1 are constant first of all suppose that both 0 and 1 have nonconstant blaschke factors thus there exist v w d such that 0 v 0 1 w but since k 3 0 k 3 and k 2 1 k 2 it follows from 8 10 that 8 15 k 1 v 1 1 and k 4 w 2 where we note that 1 6 0 and 2 6 0 observe that k 1 v 1 k 4 w indeed if k 1 v 1 then 1 1 so that by 8 12 2 which implies k 4 w 1 which contradicts the fact k 1 if instead k 4 w 1 we similarly get a contradiction since k 1 1 and k 4 1 it follows from the maximum modulus theorem that k 1 and k 4 are both constant i e 8 16 k 1 1 1 and k 4 2 then from 8 10 we should have k 2 k 3 0 which leads to a contradiction using 8 4 next we assume that 0 has a nonconstant blaschke factor and 1 has a non constant singular inner factor since 0 has a nonconstant blaschke factor w d such that 0 w 0 so that by 8 13 k 3 w 0 thus by 8 10 k 1 w 1 1 but since k 1 w 1 otherwise k 1 would be constant so that k 3 0 a contradiction from 8 4 it follows that 1 1 thus by 8 12 8 17 2 8 a subnormal toeplitz completion 71 on the other hand since 1 has a nonconstant singular inner factor we can see that there exists 0 2 such that 1 has nontangential limit 0 at ei cf ga theorem ii 6 2 thus by 8 13 k 2 has nontangential limit 0 at e i and in turn by 8 10 k 4 has nontangential limit 2 at ei but since k 4 1 it follows that 2 1 i e 2 which contradicts 8 17 next if both 0 and 1 have nonconstant singular factors then a similar argu ment gives a contradiction this proves 8 14 now in view of 8 6 and 8 14 we may write b b b b a b b 2 left coprime where 2 b b 1 we can also write 0 b d b c 0 a 0 2 a 1 b b b b 1 where 0 1 b b and 0 2 b i 2 then by 7 13 8 18 0 h 2 c 2 ker t t so that ran t t h 0 since dimh 0 1 it follows that ran t t 0 or ran t t h 0 if ran t t 0 then evidently t is normal suppose ran t t h 0 we recall a well known result of b morrel mo con p 162 if t b h satisfies the following properties i t is hyponormal ii t t is rank one and iii ker t t is invariant for t then t is quasinormal for some c i e t commutes with t t since t satisfies the above three properties we can conclude that t is quasinormal for some c on the other hand due to a technical problem we omitted a detailed proof for the case b 2 from the proof of chl 2 theorem 5 1 the proof of the case b 2 with 0 in the proof of theorem 8 2 above provides the portion of the proof that did not appear in chl 2 in particular theorem 8 2 incorporates an extension of a corrected version of chl 2 theorem 5 1 in which the exceptional case 8 1 was inadvertently omitted corollary 8 3 if t t b t t tb d l then t is subnormal if and only if and one of the following holds a ei b and e i c 0

follows from the same argument as in 8 20 we can see that 2 3 1 and 0 1 1 in other words m 1 b 1 m 2 b 2 b b m 1 m 2 1 2 c thus we can write 0 0 and b b b b 6 0 6 since t is normal we have h h 0 0 h h

pairs with matrix valued bounded type symbols in cul 1 the authors studied hyponormality of pairs of toeplitz operators called toeplitz pairs when both symbols are trigono metric polynomials the core of the main result of cul 1 is that the hyponor mality of t t t trigonometric polynomials forces that the co analytic parts of and necessarily coincide up to a constant multiple i e 9 1 h 2 for some c in hl 4 9 1 was extended for toeplitz pairs whose symbols are rational func tions with some constraint as a result the following question arises at once does 9 1 still hold for toeplitz pairs whose symbols are matrix valued trigono metric polynomials or rational functions this chapter is concerned with this question more generally we give a characterization of hyponormal toeplitz pairs with matrix valued bounded type symbols by using the theory established in the previous chapters consequently we will show that 9 1 is still true for matrix valued trigonometric polynomials under some invertibility and commutativity as sumptions on the fourier coefficients of the symbols those assumptions always hold vacuously for scalar valued cases moreover we give a characterization of the joint hyponormality of toeplitz pairs with bounded type symbols consider the self commutators of the toeplitz pairs with matrix valued rational symbols and derive rank formulae for them we first observe that if t t t then the self commutator of t can be expressed as 9 2 t t t t t t t t t t h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h the hyponormality of toeplitz pairs is also related to the kernels of hankel opera tors involved with the analytic and co analytic parts of the symbol indeed it was shown in gu 2 lemma 6 2 that if neither nor is analytic and if t t is hyponormal then 9 3 kerh kerh and kerh kerh tuples or pairs of toeplitz operators will be called toeplitz tuples or toeplitz pairs 75 76 9 hyponormal toeplitz pairs on a first perusal one might be tempted to guess that 9 1 still holds for toeplitz pairs whose symbols are matrix valued trigonometric polynomials how ever this is not the case to see this we take z 1 2 z 0 0 0 and 0 0 0 z 1 2 z then a straightforward calculation shows that if t t t then t t 0 i e t is hyponormal but evidently 6 for any constant matrix m 2 however we note that z 0 0 0 z 0 0 z 1 0 0 0 and by theorem 4 16 z 0 0 z and a 1 0 0 0 are not right coprime as we may expect if the condition and a are right coprime is assumed then we might get a matrix valued version of 9 1 as we will see in the sequel a corollary to the main result of this chapter follows the spirit of 9 1 corollary 9 22 the main theorem of this chapter theorem 9 20 gives a complete characterization of the hyponormality of toeplitz pairs with bounded type symbols roughly speaking this characterization says that the hyponormality of a toeplitz pair can be determined by the hyponormality of a single toeplitz operator to proceed we consider some basic facts recall cf p 11 that for each l mn if we put e k h mn k 1 and k h mn then t is hyponormal if and only if is normal and e is nonempty if l mn then by 2 9 t t h h h h t since the normality of is a necessary condition for the hyponormality of t the positivity ofh h h h is an essential condition for the hyponormality of t thus we isolate this property as a new notion weaker than hyponormality the reader will notice at once that this notion is meaningful for non scalar symbols definition 9 1 for l mn let t t p h h h h then t t p is called the pseudo selfcommutator of t also t is said to be pseudo hyponormal if t t p is positive semidefinite as in the case of hyponormality of scalar toeplitz operators we can see that the pseudo hyponormality of t is independent of the constant matrix term 0 thus whenever we consider the pseudo hyponormality of t we may assume without loss of generality that 0 0 observe that if l mn then t t t t p t 9 hyponormal toeplitz pairs 77 thus t is hyponormal if and only if t is pseudo hyponormal and is normal also via theorem 3 3 of ghr t is pseudo hyponormal if and only if e 6 recall that for l mn we write c k h mn k h mn thus if l mn then k e k c and k 1 we note cf ghr that if t is pseudo hyponormal then 2 2 indeed if k e then k h 2 mn so that 2 2 k 2 k 2 2 2 in view of 6 11 in chapter 6 whenever we study the pseudo hyponormality of toeplitz operators with symbol such that and are of bounded type we may assume that the symbol l mn is of the form 9 4 0 1 a and 0 b right coprime we next consider hyponormality of toeplitz operators with bounded type sym bols to do so we use an interpolation problem developed in chapter 6 proposition 9 2 pull back symbols let l mn be such that and are of bounded type in view of 9 4 we may write 0 1 a and 0 b right coprime suppose 1 a a 1 where a 1 and are left coprime then the following hold a if i is an inner divisor of 1 put 1 ph 20 cf p 12 then t is pseudo hyponormal if and only if t 1 is pseudo hyponormal b put ph 2 0 a 1 then t is pseudo hyponormal if and only if t is pseudo hyponormal proof a by proposition 6 1 b we have c 1 k k c thus the result follows at once from the observation that k k b by proposition 6 1 a we have t is pseudo hyponormal k h 2 mn k h 2 and k 1 k a 1 0 h 2 mn k ph 2 mn 0 a 1 h 2 mn t is pseudo hyponormal for an operator s b h s b h is called the moore penrose inverse of s if ss s s s ss s s s s s and ss ss 78 9 hyponormal toeplitz pairs it is known har theorem 8 7 2 that if an operator s on a hilbert space has closed range then s has a moore penrose inverse moreover the moore penrose inverse is unique whenever it exists on the other hand it is well known that if s a b b c on h 1 h 2 where the hj are hilbert spaces a b h 1 c b h 2 and b b h 2 h 1 then 9 5 s 0 a 0 c 0 and b a 12 dc 12 for some contraction d moreover in cul 1 lemma 1 2 and gu 2 lemma 2 1 it was shown that if a 0 c 0 and rana is closed then 9 6 s 0 b a b c and ranb rana or equivalently cmx lemma 1 4 9 7 bg f 2 af f cg g for all f h 1 g h 2 and furthermore if both a and c are of finite rank then 9 8 ranks ranka rank c b a b in fact if a 0 and rana is closed then we can write a a 0 0 0 0 rana kera rana kera so that the moore penrose inverse of a is given by 9 9 a a 0 1 0 0 0 we introduce a notion which will help simplify our arguments definition 9 3 let l mn for a toeplitz pair t t t the pseudo commutator of t is defined by cf definition 9 1 t t p t t p t t p t t p t t p h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h then t t t is said to be pseudo jointly hyponormal if t t p 0 evidently if t t t is pseudo hyponormal then t and t are pseudo hyponormal we begin with lemma 9 4 let l mn if t t t is hyponormal then and commute 9 hyponormal toeplitz pairs 79 proof suppose that t is hyponormal then t and t are hyponormal and hence and are normal thus by 2 9 we have t t t t t t t t t t h h h h h h h h t h h h h t h h h h but since t is hyponormal it follows from 9 7 that for any m 0 x y h 2 cn 9 10 h h h h t izmy izmx 2 h h h h izmx izmx h h h h izmy izmy note that 9 11 t izmy izmx t izmt tizmy x t y x but since lim m hc izm 0 for any c l mn and h 2 cn if we take the limits on m in 9 10 and 9 11 then we have t y x limm t izmy izmx 0 which implies that since is normal it follows from the fuglede putnam theorem that we thus have corollary 9 5 let l mn and let t t t then the following are equivalent i t is hyponormal ii t is pseudo hyponormal and are normal and proof immediate from lemma 9 4 lemma 9 6 let h mn and l mn if a left coprime then 9 12 t t t is pseudo hyponormal t 1 is pseudo hyponormal where 1 ph 20 cf p 12 proof since h mn t t t is pseudo hyponormal if and only if t t p h h h h h h t t p 0 80 9 hyponormal toeplitz pairs or equivalently by 9 7 9 13 h h x y 2 h h x x t t py y all x y h 2 cn since by assumption a and are right coprime it follows that cl ranh h cl ranh therefore the inequality 9 13 becomes h x h y h x h x t t py y all x y h 2 cn we thus have that t t p 0 if and only if t t p 0 wheret t t observe that 9 14 t t p h h h h h h t t p by 2 11 we can see that h h is a projection on h therefore it follows from 9 6 that t t p 0 t t p h h h h 0 observe that by 2 11 t t p h h h h t 1 t 1 p thus the inequality 9 13 holds if and only if t 1 is pseudo hyponormal this proves the lemma remark 9 7 in cul 1 problem 5 4 the following problem was formulated for n 1 find a block toeplitz operator r not all of whose diagonals are constant for which un r is hyponormal where u is the unilateral shift on h 2 in fact if un r is a hyponormal pair then by 9 5 r un un un 1 2 d r r 1 2 for some contraction d but since pn u n un is the orthogonal projection of rank n and pnu n 0 it follows that un r run r r 12 d pn un run r r r 1 2 d pnu n 0 which implies that r is a block toeplitz operator t with symbol l mn thus lemma 9 6 together with corollary 9 5 gives an answer to this problem since un tiz it follows that un r is hyponormal r t is normal and t 1 iz is pseudo hyponormal where denotes unitary equivalence for example if r t with z 0 0 2 z then u 2 r tzi 2 t is a hyponormal pair but t is not unitarily equivalent to any toeplitz operator indeed the essential spectrum of t is t 2 t which is not connected lemma 9 8 let l mn if t t t is pseudo hyponormal and h mn is an inner matrix function then t t t is pseudo hyponormal 9 hyponormal toeplitz pairs 81 proof suppose that t t t is pseudo hyponormal we then have t t p h p h 2 0 h p h 2 0 h p h 2 h p h 2 h t h t h t h t t h h h h t t t t p t therefore we have t t p t t p t t p t t p t t p t 0 0 t t t p t 0 0 t which gives the result lemma 9 9 let t t t and s t t where mn is a constant normal matrix commuting with and then 9 15 t is pseudo hyponormal s is pseudo hyponormal proof put t i t 0 i t t p i 0 t i and s s s p then s h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h note that if l mn and is a constant matrix such that then by the fuglede putnam theorem 9 16 h t h h t h then by a straightforward calculation together with 9 16 and the assumption that and commutes with and we can show that s t this proves the lemma lemma 9 10 let t t t be a pseudo hyponormal toeplitz pair with bounded type symbols l mn if and are not analytic and if a right coprime then 9 17 h h t 0 proof this follows from the positivity test for t t p via 9 7 we now have corollary 9 11 let t t t be a pseudo hyponormal toeplitz pair with bounded type symbols l mn which are not analytic if has a tensored scalar singularity then 9 18 kerh kerh 82 9 hyponormal toeplitz pairs proof in view of 9 4 we may write 0 1 a 0 b 2 3 c 2 d right coprime since has a tensored scalar singularity it follows from 9 17 2 10 and theorem 5 4 that h 2 3 0 and hence kerh 2 3 h 2 cn kerh lemma 9 12 let t t t be a pseudo hyponormal toeplitz pair with bounded type symbols l mn of the form 9 19 0 1 a 0 b 2 3 c 2 d right coprime if has a tensored scalar singularity and 0 2 i for some inner function then i is an inner divisor of 3 proof by assumption 2 0 thus we may write 0 1 a 0 b 0 3 c 0 d right coprime by corollary 9 11 we have 0 1 h 2 cn 0 h 2 cn it thus follows from ff corollary ix 2 2 that 1 for some square inner matrix function thus we can write 0 a 0 b 0 3 c 0 d right coprime put 1 0 1 0 then by lemma 9 8 t 1 t 1 is pseudo hyponormal by proposition 4 19 we get the following right coprime factorizations 1 a 1 1 0 1 3 c 1 1 d 1 where a 1 pk 1 a c 1 pk 3 c d 1 pk d it thus follows from lemma 9 6 that t 1 1 1 is pseudo hyponormal observe that 1 1 1 ph 20 1 i ph 20 3 c 1 3 pk 3 c 1 where the last equality follows from lemma 4 4 thus we can write 1 1 1 3 b right coprime where 3 is a left inner divisor of 3 since t 1 1 1 is pseudo hyponormal it follows from 9 4 that i is a left inner divisor of 3 and hence is a inner divisor of 3 lemma 9 13 let t t t be a pseudo hyponormal toeplitz pair with bounded type symbols l mn of the form 1 a 0 b 3 c 2 d coprime where l c m 0 2 if we let g c d 1 3 then t pseudo hyponormal t t 1 t 1 pseudo hyponormal proof this follows from a slight variation of hl 4 proof of theorem 1 for the matrix valued case by using theorem 5 9 9 hyponormal toeplitz pairs 83 lemma 9 14 suppose is a finite blaschke product of degree n let l mn be such that t t t and t t t then 9 20 t t n t t and 9 21 t t p n t t p where n deg and means unitary equivalence in particular t is pseudo hyponormal if and only if t is pseudo hyponormal remark the unitary operator given in lemma 9 14 depends only on the inner function proof of lemma 9 14 let ij l mn be arbitrary then by a well known fact due to c cowen co 1 theorem 1 there exists a unitary operator v such that t ij v n t ij v for i j 1 2 n where n deg put v v in then t t t t t t v n t t v therefore we have t t t t t t t t t t v 0 0 v n t t n t t n t t n t t v 0 0 v n t t giving 9 20 we also observe t t p t t t v n t t t v n t t p giving 9 21 the remaining assertions are evident from 9 20 and 9 21 lemma 9 15 let t t t be a pseudo hyponormal toeplitz pair with bounded type symbols l of the form 9 22 p 1 a b q 1 c d right coprime where the i is inner if pq 0 then p q 0 84 9 hyponormal toeplitz pairs proof without loss of generality we may assume that q 0 suppose that p 6 0 since t is pseudo hyponormal it follows from lemma 9 9 that t t is pseudo hyponormal for all r in particular t is pseudo hyponormal for all r observe that b d p 1 a c p thus by proposition 9 2 we can see that t is pseudo hyponormal where b d pki a pc b d pki a which gives a contradiction because 2 2 if is sufficiently large lemma 9 16 let t t t be a pseudo hyponormal toeplitz pair with bounded type symbols l mn suppose the inner parts of right coprime factorizations of and commute if and have a common tensored scalar pole then this pole has the same order proof in view of 9 4 we may write 0 1 a 0 b 2 3 c 2 d right coprime assume that 0 1 and 2 3 commute also suppose and have a common tensored scalar pole of order p and r respectively at then we can write 0 b p 0 1 b q 1 2 b r 2 3 b s 3 b z z 1 z where p r 1 q s 0 i and ib are coprime for i 0 1 2 3 by theorem 4 40 and lemma 9 14 we may assume that 0 assume to the contrary that r 6 p then without loss of generality we may assume that p r let 3 i 0 i and z p 1 and write 1 and 1 it then follows from lemma 9 8 that t 1 t 1 is pseudo hyponormal since by assumption 0 1 and 2 3 com mute it follows that 2 3 z r s 2 3 and z p 1 2 3 0 1 so that left g c d 2 3 z p 1 2 3 thus we have left g c d 2 3 2 3 i r s p 1 z i 1 by proposition 4 19 c we can write 1 z r s p 1 c 1 coprime where c 1 pk 1 c 0 1 similarly we also get the following

proof 86 9 hyponormal toeplitz pairs theorem 9 17 let t t t be a pseudo hyponormal toeplitz pair with bounded type symbols l mn suppose all inner parts of right coprime fac torizations of and are

suppose and have a common tensored scalar pole we want to show that 0 2 by theorem 4 40 and lemmas 9 14 and 9 16 we may write without loss of generality 0 z p 0 1 z q 1 2 z p 2 3 z s 3 where p 1 q s 0

coprime factorizations z a 1 zb 1 z pc 1 z d 1 p 2 where b for some nonzero let c by lemma 9 9 t t is pseudo hyponormal observe that z p p 1 a 1 c 1 on the other hand we can choose 0 c such that p 1 a 1 0 c 1 0 is not invertible in fact 0 is an eigenvalue of p 1 0 c 1 0 1 a 1 0 then by theorem 4 16 p 1 a 1 0 c 1 and iz are not coprime thus there exists a nonconstant inner divisor 1 of iz say iz 1 2 such that 0 p 2 1 p 1 a 1 0 c 1 we thus have p 2 h 2 cn kerh 0 hence by corollary 9 11 p 2 h 2 cn kerh 0 kerh z h 2 cn which implies that iz is an inner divisor of 2 and hence 1 is a constant unitary a contradiction this completes the proof corollary 9 18 let t t t be a hyponormal toeplitz pair with bounded type symbols l mn suppose all inner parts of right coprime fac torizations of and are diagonal constant if det and det have a common pole then the inner parts of and coincide proof write 0 b and 2 d right coprime suppose det and det have a common pole since det detb n 0 and det detd n 2 9 hyponormal toeplitz pairs 87 there exists d such that 0 n 2 n 0 so that 0 2 0 thus and have a common tensored scalar pole and hence it follows from theorem 9 17 corollary 9 19 let t t t be a hyponormal toeplitz pair with matrix valued trigonometric polynomial symbols whose outer coefficients are invertible then deg deg proof let z n j m ajz j and z m j l bjz j then and have a common tensored scalar pole at z 0 thus by theorem 9 16 we have m l i e deg deg the following theorem gives a characterization of hyponormality for toeplitz pairs with bounded type symbols theorem 9 20 hyponormality of toeplitz pairs with bounded type sym bols let t t t be a toeplitz pair with bounded type symbols l mn of the form 9 25 0 1 a 0 b 2 3 c 2 d coprime where the i are inner functions assume that a 0 or 2 is a finite blaschke product b 0 and 2 have a common blaschke factor b such that b and d are diagonal constant if the pair t is hyponormal then 9 26 h 2 mn for some mn moreover t is hyponormal if and only if i and are normal and ii iii t 1 is pseudo hyponormal with 0 1 3 where g c d 1 3 and left g c d i 0 3 a 1 c proof suppose t is hyponormal then by theorem 9 17 0 2 in view of lemma 9 13 we may assume that 1 and 3 are coprime by our assumption we note that b and d are invertible put b d 1 note that is diagonal constant by assumption then b d 0 so that 9 27 b d b b 1 and 0 b 1 b 1 h 2 mn 1 inner we now claim that 9 28 assume to the contrary that 6 then it follows from 9 27 that 0 1 3 3 a 1 c 0 b d 0 1 3 3 a 1 c 1 b 1 suppose that h 2 mn then 1 is nonconstant since by lemma 9 9 t t is pseudo hyponormal applying theorem 9 17 with t t in place of t t gives 0 1 which is a contradiction this proves 9 28 and hence 9 26 88 9 hyponormal toeplitz pairs towards the second assertion let g c d 1 3 then we can write 1 1 and 3 3 for some coprime inner functions 1 and 3 we thus have 0 1 3 3 a 1 c h 2 mn we claim that 9 29 3 a 1 c and 1 3 are coprime assume to the contrary that 3 a 1 c and 1 are not coprime then there exists a nonconstant inner matrix function h mn such that 3 a 1 c a and i 1 thus we have 9 30 3 a c a c a since a and i 1 are coprime it follows that a and are coprime and hence a and are coprime it thus follows from 9 30 that 3 a h 2 mn ha 3 0 i 3 h 2 cn kerha h 2 cn which implies that is a inner divisor of i 3 and hence is an inner divisor of i 3 so that is a nonconstant common inner divisor of i 1 and i 3 a contradiction this proves 9 29 let left g c d i 0 3 a 1 c then we may write 0 1 3 3 a 1 c left coprime it follows from corollary 4 8 with a 3 a 1 c 1 3 and b 0 that 3 a 1 c and 0 1 3 are left coprime and by lemma 9 6 t 1 is pseudo hyponormal where 0 1 3 0 1 3 the converse is obtained by reversing the above argument this completes the proof corollary 9 21 hyponormality of rational toeplitz pairs let t t t be a toeplitz pair with rational symbols l mn of the form 9 31 0 1 a 0 b 2 3 c 2 d coprime assume that 0 and 2 are not coprime assume also that b 0 and d 0 are diagonal constant for some 0 z 0 if the pair t is hyponormal then 9 32 h 2 mn for some mn moreover the pair t is hyponormal if and only if i and are normal and ii with b 0 d 0 1 iii t 1 is pseudo hyponormal with 0 1 3 where g c d 1 3 and left g c d i 0 3 a 1 c proof this follows from theorem 9 20 9 hyponormal toeplitz pairs 89 for the following result we recall the notion of outer coefficient defined on page 9 corollary 9 22 hyponormality of polynomial toeplitz pairs let l mn be matrix valued trigonometric polynomials of the form 9 33 z n j m ajz j and z m j bjz j satisfying i the outer coefficients a m an b and bm are invertible ii the co analytic outer coefficients a m and b are diagonal constant if t t t is hyponormal then 9 34 h 2 mn for some constant matrix mn remark if and are scalar valued trigonometric polynomials then all assump tions of the above result are trivially satisfied and hence the above result reduces to 9 1 proof of corollary 9 22 this follows from corollary 9 21 together with the following observations if and are matrix valued trigonometric polynomials of the form 9 33 then under the notation of corollary 9 21 we have i i z mi for some mi n and hence z i 0 ii a 0 an b 0 a m c 0 bm and d 0 b iii if an a m bm and b are invertible then the representation 9 33 are coprime factorizations iv b 0 and d 0 are diagonal constant we next consider the self commutators of the toeplitz pairs with matrix valued rational symbols and derive rank formulae for their self commutators let l mn be matrix valued rational functions of the form 9 35 0 1 a 0 b 2 3 c 2 d coprime by corollary 9 18 if the pair t t is hyponormal and if 0 and 2 are not coprime then 0 2 the following question arises at once question 9 23 let t t t be hyponormal where and are given in 9 35 does it follow that 1 3 the answer to question 9 23 is negative even for scalar valued symbols as shown by the following example example 9 24 let l and l be of the form 4 z z 2 zb z where b z z 1 2 1 1 2 z under the notation of corollary 9 21 and we have a 3 c 1 4 b 2 90 9 hyponormal toeplitz pairs since 4 b 2 0 0 we have z and ph 20 1 c ph 2 0 z 2 2 z thus we have z 2 z and t is hyponormal therefore by corollary 9 21 t t t is hyponormal note that 1 1 6 b 3 however if the symbols are matrix valued rational function then the answer to question 9 23 is indeed affirmative under some assumptions on the symbols theorem 9 25 let t t t be a hyponormal toeplitz pair with rational symbols l mn of the form 9 36 0 1 a 0 b 2 3 c 2 d coprime assume that i z 0 z 1 ii z 0 z 2 6 iii b 0 and d 0 are diagonal constant for some 0 z 0 then 0 2 and 1 3 remark 9 26 note that z 0 6 z 1 and z 2 6 z 3 in example 9 24 proof of theorem 9 25 by corollary 9 18 we have 0 2 in view of corollary 9 13 we may write 0 1 a 0 b 0 3 c 0 d coprime where the 1 and 3 are coprime by corollary 9 21 it follows that t 1 is pseudo hyponormal with 0 1 3 where left g c d i 0 3 a 1 c with b 0 d 0 1 thus we can write 9 37 i 0 0 and 3 a 1 c a 1 0 a 1 h mn suppose z 0 z 1 then we can write 0 n k 1 bpk k and 1 n k 1 bqk k k d pk qk z clearly g c d 0 1 n k 1 brk k rk min pk qk thus we may write 9 38 0 0 and 1 1 i is a finite blaschke product for i 0 1 since 1 and 3 are coprime it follows from 3 1 that z 1 z 3 and hence z 0 z 3 so that 0 and 3 are coprime it follows from 9 37 and 9 38 that i 0 i 0 0 and 3 a 1 c a 1 by corollary 4 8 and theorem 4 16 we can easily see that 9 39 i and are coprime by theorem 4 16 i d and i are coprime thus and are coprime so that z z and hence z z 0 since is a inner divisor of 0 z z 0 and hence z thus is a constant so that is 9 hyponormal toeplitz pairs 91 a constant unitary we now want to show that 3 1 assume to the contrary that 3 6 1 observe that 9 40 h 1 h p h 2 0 h h 1 c 0 0 1 3 it thus follows that 0 h 2 cn kerh 1 kerh 1 h 2 cn a contradiction therefore we must have 3 1 this completes the proof corollary 9 27 let l mn be matrix valued trigonometric polynomials such that the outer coefficients of and are invertible and the co analytic outer coefficients of and are diagonal constant if t t t is hyponormal then deg deg proof immediate from theorem 9 25 if the matrix valued rational symbols and have the same co analytic and analytic degrees we get a general necessary condition for the hyponormality of the pair t t t this plays an important role in getting a rank formula for the self commutator t t theorem 9 28 let t t t be a hyponormal toeplitz pair with rational symbols l mn of the form 9 41 0 1 a 0 b 2 1 c 2 d coprime suppose i z 0 z 2 6 ii b 0 and d 0 are diagonal constant then kz 1 for some mn proof by corollary 9 18 we have 0 2 it follows from corollary 9 21 that t 1 is pseudo hyponormal with 0 1 with left g c d i 0 a 0 c 0 where a 0 pk 0 a and c 0 pk 0 c then we can easily see that 9 42 i 0 also since is a left inner divisor of a 0 c 0 it follows that a 0 c 0 0 h 2 mn by lemma 4 4 c 0 k 0 and hence a 0 c 0 k 0 therefore a 0 c 0 0 h 2 mn k 0 0 which implies a 0 c 0 put a 1 a a 0 and c 1 c c 0 then we may write 0 1 a 0 a 1 0 1 c 0 c 1 1 a 2 c 2 where a 2 0 a 1 c 2 1 c 1 h 2 mn which implies kz 1 by lemma 4 4 it thus follows from corollary 9 21 that kz 1 which proves the theorem 92 9 hyponormal toeplitz pairs we now obtain the rank formula for self commutators theorem 9 29 let t t t be a hyponormal toeplitz pair with rational symbols l mn of the form 0 1 a 0 b 2 1 c 2 d coprime if 0 and 2 are not coprime and b 0 and d 0 are diagonal constant for some 0 z 0 then 9 43 t t w i k m k m 1 1 1 1 w 0 t t 1 1 1 1 0 with w ta 0 1 w 0 0 tc 0 1 w where k c is a polynomial cf 6 3 and w and m are given by 6 4 and 6 5 with 0 1 in particular 9 44 rank t t rank t t rank i k m k m remark 9 30 we note that the formula 9 43 does not say that the hyponor mality of t implies the hyponormality of the pair t indeed 9 43 is true for the selfcommutators only when the pair t is already hyponormal via corollary 9 21 proof of theorem 9 29 by corollary 9 18 we have 0 2 let b 0 d 0 1 since t t t is hyponormal it follows from corollary 9 21 that since t and t are hyponormal we can find functions k c and k 1 c we thus have h hk and h hk 1 a straightforward calculation with lemma 6 8 shows that h h h h h i ta w i 1 k m k 1 m w tc h h h h h i ta w i k m k m w ta h h h h h i tc w i k 1 m k 1 m w tc where w and m are given by 6 4 and 6 5 with 0 1 and i is the identity on cn d but since ran t t h i h i we have 9 45 t t t t h i h i 0 h h h h h i h h h h h i h h h h h i h h h h h i 0 w i k m k m i 1 k m k 1 m i k 1 m 1 k m i k 1 m k 1 m w 0 where w ta w 0 0 tc w 9 hyponormal toeplitz pairs 93 on the other hand since t is hyponormal it follows from theorem 9 28 that kz 1 thus we can see that c 1 1 c 1 1 c 1 1 it thus follows from proposition 6 1 that 9 46 c c which implies that 9 47 c 1 k k c thus we can choose k 1 c such that k 1 1 k in what follows we recall that k is a polynomial and k m is defined by 6 6 therefore it follows from lemma 6 9 that 9 48 1 k m k 1 m 1 k m k m k m 1 i i k m k m k m and similarly 9 49 k 1 m 1 k m k m k m also by 9 47 and lemma 6 9 we have 9 50 k 1 m k 1 m 1 k m 1 k m k m 1 i 1 i k m k m k m thus by 9 45 9 48 9 49 and 9 50 we have t t w i k m k m i k m k m i k m k m i k m k m w 0 w i k m k m 1 1 1 1 w 0 t t 1 1 1 1 0 which proves 9 43 on the other hand since a is invertible for each zero of 0 1 it follows from corollary 5 8 that ta 0 1 and tc 0 1 are invertible therefore w is invertible so that the rank formula 9 44 is obtained from 9 43 on the other hand theorem 9 29 can be extended to toeplitz m tuples to see this we observe lemma 9 31 let i l mn i 1 2 m and let be a permutation on 1 2 m then t t 1 t m is hyponormal if and only if t t 1 t m is hyponormal furthermore we have rank t t rank t t proof obvious 94 9 hyponormal toeplitz pairs lemma 9 32 let i l mn i 1 2 m then the m tuple t t 1 t m is hyponormal if and only if every sub tuple of t is hyponormal remark a tuple t is considered to be its own sub tuple proof of lemma 9 32 in view of lemma 9 31 it suffices to show that if t is hyponormal then for every m 0 m the sub tuple tm 0 t 1 t m 0 is hyponormal but this is obvious since t t t m 0 t m 0 corollary 9 33 for each i 1 2 m suppose i i i l mn is a matrix valued rational function of the form i i a i and i ib i coprime assume that there exists j 0 1 j 0 m such that j 0 and i are not coprime for each i 1 2 m if bi 0 is diagonal constant for some 0 z i and for each i 1 2 m then the following statements are equivalent a the m tuple t t 1 t 2 t m is hyponormal b every subpair of t is hyponormal moreover if t is hyponormal then t t p t 1 t 1 p 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 w i k m k m 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 w 0 where k c 1 is a polynomial cf 6 3 w and m are given by 6 4 and 6 5 with 1 and w diag tai i w in particular rank t t p rank t 1 t 1 p rank i k m k m proof a b immediate from lemma 9 32 b a we follow the idea in cul 1 corollary 2 11 since every subpair tij t i t j of t is hyponormal for each i j it follows from theorem 9 29 that t ij tij p t i t i 1 1 1 1 0 1 i j m 9 hyponormal toeplitz pairs 95 therefore t t p t 1 t 1 p t 2 t 1 p t m t 1 p t 1 t 2 p t 2 t 2 p t m t 2 p t 1 t m p t 2 t m p t m t m p t 1 t 1 p 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 w i k m k m 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 w 0 where w diag tai i w the rank formula is obvious this completes the proof chapter 10 concluding remarks in this paper we have tried to answer a number of questions involving matrix functions of bounded type there are however still many questions that we were unable to answer these questions have to do with whether properties involving matrix rational functions can be transmitted to the case of matrix functions of bounded type concretely this means that if we know property x in the case when is a finite blaschke product in the decomposition 2 6 of a matrix function whose adjoint is of bounded type then property x is still true for the cases of any inner function consequently the main problem lies on the cases where is a singular inner function below we pose some questions involving matrix functions of bounded type 1 mutual singularity of two finite positive borel measures in chapter 3 we have considered coprime singular inner functions to understand well functions of bounded type this is helpful when considering coprime factorizations for functions of bounded type here is a relevant question let and be finite positive borel measures on t for x t and r 0 write b x r xei 0 r for x supp let qr x b x r b x r now we may define a derivative of with respect to at x to be d x lim r 0 qr x at those points x supp at which this limit exists in this case we may ask problem 10 1 let and be finite positive borel measures on t does it follow that if and only if d x 0 a e if is the lebesgue measure on t then the answer to problem 10 1 is affirma tive cf ru theorem 7 14 we also have problem 10 2 let 1 2 h be singular inner functions with singular measures 1 and 2 respectively are the following statements equivalent a 1 and 2 are not coprime 97 98 10 concluding remarks b there exists x s supp 1 supp 2 and 0 m 1 such that m 1 b x r 2 b x r r 6 0 where b x r xei 0 r c d 1 2 6 0 2 2 coprime factorizations for compositions in theorem 4 40 we have shown that if h mn is such that is of bounded type of the form a right coprime then for a blaschke factor we have 10 1 a right coprime however we were unable to decide whether 10 1 holds for any inner function problem 10 3 let h mn be inner and a h mn if and a are right coprime does it follow that and a are right coprime for any inner function h 3 invertibility of the compressions let a h 2 mn and i h mn be a rational function i e is a finite blaschke product in corollary 5 8 we have shown that if a and are coprime then ta the compression of ta to h is invertible however we were unable to decide when ta is invertible problem 10 4 give a necessary and sufficient condition for ta to be in vertible if i for an arbitrary inner function 4 an interpolation problem for matrix functions of bounded type in chapter 6 we have considered an interpolation problem for a matrix function l mn when does there exist a bounded analytic matrix function k h mn satisfying k h mn in particular we are interested in the cases when and are of bounded type as we have discussed in chapter 6 kerh kerh is a necessary condition for the existence of a solution if is a matrix valued rational function then using the kronecker lemma we can show that this condition is also sufficient for the existence of a solution cf chl 2 proposition 3 9 moreover in this case the solution k is given by a polynomial via the classical hermite feje r interpolation problem however we were unable to determine whether the condition kerh kerh is sufficient for the existence of a solution when l mn is such that and are of bounded type problem 10 5 let l mn be such that and are of bounded type if kerh kerh does there exist a solution k h mn satisfying k h mn 5 square hyponormal toeplitz operators in theorem 7 3 we have shown that if l mn is such that and are of bounded type and if has a tensored scalar singularity then the subnormality and the normality of t coincide also in chl 2 theorem 4 5 it was shown that if l mn is a matrix valued rational function whose inner part of the coprime factorization of its co analytic part is diagonal constant and if t and t 2 are hyponormal then t is either normal or 10 concluding remarks 99 analytic however we were unable to decide whether this result still holds for matrix valued bounded type symbols problem 10 6 let l mn be such that and are of bounded type of the form b coprime where is an inner function in h if t and t 2 are hyponormal does it follow that t is either normal or analytic bibliography ab m b abrahamse subnormal toeplitz operators and functions of bounded type duke math j 43 1976 597 604 ac p r ahern and d n
