between the classical theory of full and truncated moment problems and the theory of partial differential equa tions as follows for the classical heat equation tu u with initial data u 0 s r n we first compute the moments s t of the unique solution u s rn these moments are polynomials in the time variable of degree comparable to and with coefficients satisfying a recursive relation this allows us to define the polynomials for any sequence and prove that they pre serve some of the features of the heat kernel in the case of moment sequences the polynomials trace a curve which we call the heat curve which remains in the moment cone for positive time but may wander outside the moment cone for negative time this provides a description of the boundary points of the moment cone which are also moment sequences we also study how the determinacy of a moment sequence behaves along the heat curve next we consider the transport equation tu ax u and conduct a similar analysis along the way we incorporate several illustrating examples contents 1 introduction 1 2 time dependent moments from the heat equation tu u 2 3 time dependent moments from the transport equation tu ax u 14 4 concluding

interested in a 1 parameter family of sequences that is a family depending on a parameter t we call time s t in order to gain insightful information we ask that the representing measure of the moment sequence fulfills an evolution equation we study here two simple cases the heat equation tu u and the transport equation tu x u the representing measure will be necessarily of the form d t x u x t dx first we calculate the time dependent moments for these cases we then investigate starting with a moment sequence at t 0 how deter minacy and indeterminacy of the moment sequence changes for which times the time dependent sequences remain moment sequences which structure of the mo ment cone i e the set of all moment sequences is revealed by the time dependent moments and what can be said about the underlying representing measures with changing time t without necessarily solving the evolution equation in section 2 we discuss in detail the case of the heat equation tu u and we present some illustrative examples section 3 is reserved for a study of the transport equation tu ax u and we give some revealing examples finally in section 4 we consider an equation of the form tu x t u x t ax u x t that is a suitable combination of the heat and transport equations 2 time dependent moments from the heat equation tu u let 0 and n n consider the heat equation tu x t u x t u x 0 u 0 x 2 with x x 1 xn t rn and u 0 s rn a schwartz function it is well known that 2 has the unique solution u t t u 0 3 with the heat kernel t x 1 4 t n 2 e x 2 4 t 4 for all t 0 and with x 2 x 21 x 2 n here denotes convolution 0 is the dirac distribution since 0 u 0 u 0 holds also recall that the heat equation admits non physical solutions and when u 0 0 there are infinitely many solutions which grow very rapidly with x see joh 95 ch 7 for more on the heat equation see e g eva 10 ch 2 3 time dependent moments from the heat equation 3 if u 0 s rn then u t s rn for all t 0 hence all moments of u x t exist and are time dependent s t rn x u x t dx with nn 0 if u 0 0 then u t 0 for all t 0 and therefore s t s t nn 0 is a moment sequence with representing measure d u x t dx for all t 0 the one parameter family s t of moment sequences describes a curve in the moment cone this curve is given by a polynomial with and without the restriction u 0 0 as a matter of fact all s are polynomials in t as we now prove in the next lemma x denotes the largest k z with k x lemma 2 1 let n n and 0 and let u be a solution of the heat equation 2 with u 0 s rn then i s r t with deg s 1 2 n 2 for all nn 0 the coefficients of s t depend only on the moments s 0 of u 0 with i e j j for all j 1 n ii for n 1 and all k n 0 we have s 2 k t k j 0 2 k 2 k 2 j j s 2 k 2 j 0 t j and s 2 k 1 t k j 0 2 k 1 2 k 1 2 j j s 2 k 1 2 j 0 t j proof i without loss of generality assume that 1 since u solves 2 we have ts t t rn x u x t dx rn x tu x t dx rn x u x t dx and since u t s rn for all t 0 partial integration twice gives rn x u x t dx with 1 n nn 0 this implies x 21 2 n x n j 1 j j 1 x 2 ej where ej denotes the n tuple with j th coordinate equal to 1 and zeros elsewhere this gives ts t n j 1 j j 1 s 2 ej t 5 with initial values s 0 and with s 2 ej t 0 for all with j 1 for some j 1 n now observe that 5 is a recursive system of odes which proves the statement ii from 5 we get ts 0 t 0 i e s 0 t s 0 0 and ts 2 j t 2 j 2 j 1 s 2 j 2 t 4 time dependent moments from the heat equation as well as ts 1 t 0 i e s 1 t s 1 0 and ts 2 j 1 t 2 j 1 2 j s 2 j 1 t and can easily be solved by recursion thus establishing ii remark 2 2 lemma 2 1 shows that at our disposal we have an explicit polynomial and also unique access to the moments at all times t 0 without the need to calculate the convolution u t t u 0 in fact only the moments s 0 of the initial data u 0 must be known we also want to emphasize that the polynomial of the moment s only depends on the lower moments s 0 i e j j for all j 1 n this will enable us to use these results in the case of the truncated moment problem since the polynomials s t are unique and depend only on s 0 with we define them for any initial sequence s s 0 nn 0 irrespective of whether the sequence is a moment sequence definition 2 3 let n n and d n for a sequence s s 0 nn 0 d we define ps ps nn 0 d r t where ps are the polynomials s t as in lemma 2 1 corollary 2 4 p has the following properties i ps 0 s ii pps t 1 t 2 ps t 1 t 2 for all t 1 t 2 r and iii pa s b s a ps b ps for all a b r and s s sequences proof i and iii are clear ii follows from the semi group property of the heat kernel t 1 t 2 u 0 t 1 t 2 u 0 example 2 5 for n 1 k n 0 and ps k the polynomials in lemma 2 1 ii we have ps 0 t s 0 t s 0 0 ps 1 t s 1 t s 1 0 ps 2 t s 2 t s 2 0 2 s 0 0 t ps 3 t s 3 t s 3 0 6 s 1 0 t 6 ps 4 t s 4 t s 4 0 12 s 2 0 t 12 s 0 0 t 2 ps 5 t s 5 t s 5 0 20 s 3 0 t 60 s 1 0 t 2 example 2 6 let n n by definition we have s t rn x u x t dx and hence as in lemma 2 1 we get ts t rn x tu x t dx rn x u x t dx rn x u x t dx time dependent moments from the heat equation 5 now for nn 0 with 2 and letting ei denote the n tuple with 1 on the i th entry and 0 s elsewhere we have x 21 2 n x 2 for 2 e 1 2 en and 0 otherwise hence ts 0 t 0 s 0 t s 0 0 and ts t 2 s 0 t 2 s 0 0 for 2 e 1 2 en and 0 for nn 0 2 6 2 e 1 2 en in summary solving the ordinary differential equations we get ps t s t s 0 2 s 0 0 t for 2 e 1 2 en and s 0 for nn 0 2 6 2 e 1 2 en with the riesz functional ls defined by ls x s and linearly extended to all r x 1 xn we see that ps describes a curve in the moment cone which is given by a polynomial in each component that is lps t x ps t s t r t the heat kernel t is itself a solution of the heat equation 2 in fact it is the fundamental solution but we already mentioned that 0 is the dirac distribution i e the measure point evaluation at x 0 0 for t 0 we have that t is a gaussian normal distribution for notational simplicity we set 0 0 since the heat equation is invariant with respect to translation we also know that t x x 0 for any x 0 rn and t 0 are fundamental solutions for x 0 all moments exist since it is only point evaluation at x 0 for the gaussian t x x 0 s rn it is also true that all moments exist a combination of lemma 2 1 and definition 2 3 yields the following result theorem 2 7 let k n n n p 1 pk rn c 1 ck r and t 1 tk 0 set mini ti and s s nn 0 n with s rn x d x and 0 x k i 0 ci ti x pi then for all t we have that the sequence ps t is represented by t x k i 0 ci ti t x pi proof by lemma 2 1 and linearity of the integral moments in the measure t x it is sufficient to show the statement for k 1 now for t t 1 0 the statement follows from t t 1 t t 1 for t 0 it follows from t t 1 t 1 t it remains to treat the special case t t 1 this case follows from rn x t x x 0 dx t 0 x 0 rn x d x 0 x for all nn 0 6 time dependent moments from the heat equation remark 2 8 observe that in the previous result t is not possible yet that is it remains an open question whether those values are accessible to visualize this take 0 then the moments are s 0 t 1 s 1 t 0 and s 2 t 2 t that is for t 0 we have one gaussian distribution but for t 0 we have s 2 t 0 and with s 0 t 1 this implies that this moment sequence can not be represented by one point evaluation and at least two signed point evaluation are required hence additional point evaluations appear for n n and d n we denote by sd n short sd the set moment cone of all truncated moment sequences s s d in n variables by s n short s we denote the set of all moment sequences in n variables i e with no restrictions on also in what follows if the index n is dropped then n is any n n definition 2 9 let n n and d n for s sd we define is t r ps t sd in the case d 0 we have s 0 r 0 and therefore ps ps 0 has only the polynomial ps 0 t s 0 0 i e is r in the case d 1 we have s 1 s 0 0 se 1 0 sen 0 rn 1 s 0 0 0 but then only the restriction ps 0 t s 0 0 0 exists which is fulfilled for all t r or if s 0 0 0 then we have se 1 0 sen 0 0 i e ps t 0 for all t r and again is r hence d 0 and d 1 for any n n are the trivial cases s s 0 or s 1 is r additionally s 0 also implies i 0 r in all other cases we have the following result theorem 2 10 let n n d 2 or d and s sd 0 then is ds or ds with ds 0 s 2 e 1 0 s 2 en 0 2 n s 0 0 for d we always have is ds and for d 2 finite we have is ds if and only if ps ds sd sd proof we prove the statement in a below for finite d 2 and then in b below for d a let d n with d 2 and s sd 0 a i we show that if c is 6 then c is by definition 2 9 we have 0 is i e is 6 let c is then by definition 2 9 we have s ps c sd and since d 2 is finite by richter s theorem ric 57 satz 4 there exists an at most k n d d atomic representing measure k i 1 ci xi of s with ci 0 and xi rn but by theorem 2 7 for all t 0 we have that ps c t is represented by a non negative gaussian mixture i e all moments are finite hence ps c t sd for all t 0 and c is time dependent moments from the heat equation 7 a ii we show that ds inft is t s 2 e 1 0 s 2 en 0 2 n s 0 0 the ps from exam ple 2 6 show that lps t x 2 1 x 2 n n i 1 ps 2 en t n i 1 s 2 e 1 0 2 ns 0 0 t 0 7 which implies the bound on t resp its infimum ds by a i we have ds is a iii is ds if and only if ps ds sd follows directly from a ii and definition 2 9 b we now prove the statements for d b i we show ds is let k n s s nn 0 s and denote by s k sk the truncated moment sequence up to order k i e s k s k then ds k is a non increasing sequence 0 hence ds lim k ds k 0 exists and ds ds k implies ds k n ds k is b ii we show ds is since ds is we have that ps ds s is a moment sequence for all 0 hence lps ds p 0 for all p r x 1 xn with p 0 and 0 but since is continuous in we have lps ds p lim 0 lps ds p 0 for all p r x 1 xn with p 0 therefore lps ds is a moment functional ps ds s is a moment sequence and ds is corollary 2 11 let d 2 or d and s sd 0 with ds is if ds s 2 e 1 0 s 2 en 0 2 n s 0 0 then ps ds is represented by s 0 0 0 and if additionally ds 0 then s is represented by the gaussian s 0 0 ds proof since ps ds sd we have by 7 lps ds x 2 1 x 2 n 0 i e the non trivial representing measure of ps ds is supported only at x 0 if ds 0 then from theorem 2 7 it follows that s is represented by s 0 0 ds definition 2 12 we call ds the heat distance of s to the boundary of sd the terminology of heat distance is due to the connection to the heat equation 2 and to avoid confusion with the euclidean distance in rn sd with n n dn definition 2 13 let d 2 or d and s sd we define cs ps is sd 8 and we call cs a heat curve 8 time dependent moments from the heat equation lemma 2 1 and theorem 2 10 imply that the heat curves cs are given by poly nomials and are completely contained in sd in fact one can interpret the heat curves cs also in the following way for any sequence s not necessarily a moment sequence we have seen that ps determines a curve then we ask if and when this curve ps r lies in the moment cone sd we get cs ps r sd so the heat equation generates a flow p of sequences s 7 ps and the heat curves cs are the trajectories or parts of the trajectories which are contained in the moment cone sd while the future ps t with t 0 of a moment sequence s sd always remains in sd the past t 0 does not if s was an interior moment sequence then ps is a well defined path to the boundary of sd if ps ds sd also is a moment sequence i e sd it is simpler to find a representing measure for ps ds than for s rank reduction in the hankel matrices then having found a finitely atomic representing measure of ps ds allows to construct a gaussian mixture representation by theorem 2 7 theorem 2 10 implies that two heat curves either coincide or are disjoint this is stated in the following corollary corollary 2 14 let n n d 2 or d for s s sd we have either i cs cs or ii cs cs hence each heat curve cs is an equivalence class in the moment cone sd definition 2 15 we define p in sd by s p s cs cs the heat curves cs are the equivalence classes in s cs for d 2 finite is ds means that the heat curve of s starts at a boundary moment sequence s and every other point on cs is an interior moment sequence which has a unique path to the boundary moment sequence s that implies the following theorem 2 16 let n n and d n with d 2 set cd s sd sd cs sd if d is finite then sd sd cd p and p sd sd 0 cd s t 7 ps t is a bijective and polynomial map s 6 0 with the inverse map s 7 ps ds ds i e p parametrizes precisely the subset cd of the moment cone sd if d we have s s p and for s 6 0 we have the bijective and polynomial map p s 0 s s t 7 ps t i e p parametrizes the moment cone s time dependent moments from the heat equation 9 proof let d be finite since by example 2 6 we have ps t s 0 2 s 0 0 t for 2 e 1 2 en with s 0 0 6 0 we find that for s sd sd already the map ps 2 e 1 0 cs t 7 ps 2 e 1 t is bijective and hence ps 0 cs is bijective but by corollary 2 14 two heat curves either coincide or are disjoint this proves the bijectivity of p the inverse map follows immediately from theorem 2 10 for d the moment cone s is closed s s s and c s note that cd is full dimensional that is cd has nonempty interior for n 1 the boundary moment sequences of the truncated moment cone can easily be described by their representing measures since the fundamental theorem of algebra holds and hence the boundary moment sequences are determined ric 57 we therefore study at first the n 1 case with d finite let n 1 d n and s s 2 d 0 recall the hankel matrix of s is defined by h s s d 0 r n 1 n 1 and define h s 0 vth s v 0 for all v rn 1 and h s 0 vth s v 0 for all v rn 1 then we have the following result see e g sch 17 thm 9 15 and cor 9 16 lemma 2 17 let d n and s s 2 d 0 a real sequence the following are equivalent i h s 0 and h s 6 0 ii there exists a k atomic measure with k d and an a 0 such that s x d x for all 0 2 d 1 and s 2 d x 2 d d x a for some a 0 if v v 0 vd rd 1 with v 6 0 and vth s v 0 then supp z f with f x v 0 v 1 x vdxd in dd 19 we already showed that any interior point in the moment cone has a gaussian mixture representation we will now use theorem 2 16 to show an easy way to compute it at least for n 1 theorem 2 18 let n 1 d n j 0 1 and s s 2 d j 0 with h s 0 for j 1 choose a real number s 2 d 2 and for j 0 choose real numbers s 2 d 1 and s 2 d 2 such that h s 0 with s s 2 d 2 0 then det h ps t 10 time dependent moments from the heat equation has a smallest zero 0 and s is represented by the gaussian mixture x k i 1 ci x xi with k d 1 c 1 ck 0 and x 1 xk r the zeros of f x v 0 v 1 x vd 1 x d 1 where v 0 vd 1 t kerh ps 0 proof from lemma 2 17 it is easy to see that for n 1 a sequence s s 2 d 2 0 is a moment sequence in the interior of the moment cone if and only if h s 0 by theorem 2 10 we have ps ds s 2 d 2 i e h ps ds 0 but 6 0 and h ps t 0 for all t ds hence ds is the smallest zero 0 of det h ps t by lemma 2 17 there exists a k atomic representing measure with k d 1 of ps ds 2 d 1 0 with supp z f with f v 0 vd 1 xd 1 and v 0 vd 1 t kerh ps ds then by theorem 2 7 s is represented by the gaussian mixture from definition 2 3 we know that each component ps t r t depends only on s with hence in the time evolution lps t p 0 for p 0 r x 1 xn we find that there is a pt x r x 1 xn t such that lps t p 0 ls pt for all t r this pt can be found by rearranging lps t p 0 deg p 0 c t s with c r t then pt can be defined uniquely from the c s note that in the following definition and lemma the polynomial pt just like ps t is defined for all t r definition 2 19 let p 0 x c 0 x r x 1 xn with c r t from lps t p 0 deg p 0 c t s we define pt x deg p 0 c t x for all t r lemma 2 20 let p 0 r x 1 xn then pt r x 1 xn t is the unique solution of tpt x pt x for all t r with initial data p 0 additionally we have deg pt deg p 0 for all t r where deg is the degree in x proof let u 0 c c rn s rn and u be the unique solution of tu x t u x t u x 0 u 0 x time dependent moments from the heat equation 11 since pt r x 1 xn for all t r and p 0 r x 1 xn is arbitrary it is sufficient to prove tpt x pt x at t 0 we have from definition 2 19 rn pt x u 0 x dx rn p 0 x u x t dx by differentiating with respect to t we get t rn pt x u 0 x dx t 0 t rn p 0 x u x t dx t 0 rn p 0 x tu x t dx t 0 rn p 0 x u x t dx t 0 rn p 0 x u x t dx t 0 rn p 0 x u 0 x dx since u 0 c c rn was arbitrary we have tpt x t 0 p 0 x which proves the statement example 2 21 for n 1 we have s 0 t s 0 0 s 1 t s 1 0 and s 2 t s 2 0 2 s 0 0 t see 6 for p 0 x c 0 0 c 1 0 x c 2 0 x 2 we therefore have ls t p 0 c 0 0 s 0 t c 1 0 s 1 t c 2 0 s 2 t c 0 0 s 0 0 c 1 0 s 1 0 c 2 0 s 2 0 2 s 0 0 t c 0 0 2 c 2 0 t s 0 0 c 1 0 s 1 0 c 2 0 s 2 0 c 0 t s 0 0 c 1 t s 1 0 c 2 t s 2 0 ls pt i e pt x c 0 0 2 c 2 0 t c 1 0 x c 2 0 x 2 tpt x 2 c 2 0 and 2 xpt x 2 c 2 0 for all t r remark 2 22 lemma 2 20 can be also interpreted as follows the unique solution of the heat equation is gained by convolution with t and we have the well known relation rn g x t f x dx rn rn g x t x y f y dx dy rn t g y f y dy 12 time dependent moments from the heat equation for a measure 0 we define t t 0 in the same manner rn f x d t x rn rn f x t x y d 0 y 9 a which results in rn t f y d 0 y 9 b and t solves the heat equation together 9 a and 9 b can be used to provide an alternative proof of lemma 2 20 this requires however a proof that t p r x 1 xn t for all p r x 1 xn this can be done but it is nontrivial we believe our proof of lemma 2 20 is conceptually stronger and yields a polynomial in a straightforward way let n n and s s be a moment sequence the sequence s is called determinate if it has exactly one representing measure otherwise it is called indeterminate we will now see how determinacy and indeterminacy are preserved along the heat curve cs theorem 2 23 let n n and s s be an indeterminate moment sequence then ps t is indeterminate for all t 0 proof first we prove that ps t is indeterminate for all t 0 for some 0 since s is indeterminate and it has at least two distinct representing measures 0 and 0 since 0 and 0 are distinct there exists a measurable a rn such that rn a x d 0 x 6 rn a x d 0 where a is the characteristic function of a without loss of generality a is compact for the time dependent measures t and t we find from 9 that rn a x d t x rn t a d 0 x rn a x d t x rn t a d 0 x both and depend continuously on t 0 and since for t 0 we have there exists an 0 such that 6 for all t 0 i e t and t are two distinct representing measures of ps t and hence ps t is indeterminate for all t 0 now we show that for t 2 there are c functions f 2 and f 2 such that d 2 x f 2 x dx and d 2 x f 2 x dx it is sufficient to show this for 0 since s 0 rn 1 d 0 we have 0 a for all borel measurable sets a b rn let e x 2 the lebesgue measure on rn then 0 and are finite measures hence by the lebesgue decomposition bog 07 thm 3 2 3 there exists a integrable function g such that 0 g with i e is singular with respect to there exists a b rn with a 0 but a 0 time dependent moments from the heat equation 13 we show that t for t 0 is no longer singular with respect to let a b rn with a 0 i e also the lebesgue measure a 0 then a x 1 for x a 0 else t a 0 for all t 0 and therefore t a rn a x d t x rn rn a x t x y d y dx rn t a y d y rn 0 d y 0 hence for t 4 we have that 4 h for a integrable function h in summary for t 2 we have 2 2 0 2 g 2 2 g e x 2 4 h 2 g e x 2 4 h e x 2 2 g e x 2 4 h e x 2 f 2 with f 2 a c function in the same way we get 2 f 2 for a c function f 2 we already showed that t 6 t for all t 0 i e for t 2 we get f 2 6 f 2 since the heat equation has the backwards uniqueness see e g eva 10 ch 2 3 we have t f 2 6 t f 2 for all t 0 i e t 6 t for all t 0 therefore pt s is an indeterminate moment sequence for all t 0 example 2 24 let s ek 2 2 k n 0 then for any c 1 1 the sequence s is represented by d c fc dx with fc x 1 c sin 2 lnx 0 x x 2 e lnx 2 2 i e s is an indeterminate moment sequence sti 94 by the backwards uniqueness of the heat equation we have t fc 6 t fc for all c c 1 1 with c 6 c and t 0 hence ps t is indeterminate for all t 0 corollary 2 25 let n n and s s be a determinate moment sequence then ps t is a determinate moment sequence for all t is 0 proof assume ps t is an indeterminate moment sequence for some t 0 then by theorem 2 23 we also know that s p 0 s is indeterminate a contradiction in theorem 2 23 we also proved the following result 14 time dependent moments from the heat equation theorem 2 26 let n n s s and be the lebesgue measure on rn then there exists a family ft t 0 of integrable c functions with ft 1 t 2 t 1 ft 2 t 2 ft 1 for all t 1 t 2 0 such that ps t is represented by ft for all t 0 i e ps t rn x ft x dx for all nn 0 and t 0 corollary 2 27 let n n s s be a moment sequence and be the lebesgue measure on rn if ds 0 and s has a representing measure not of the form f with a c function f then s is indeterminate proof since ds 0 we have that pt s s is a moment sequence for t ds 2 by theorem 2 26 s is represented by f for a c function and by assumption also by not of this form i e s has two distinct representing measures and is therefore indeterminate for n 1 it can be shown that s is determinate if and only if the multiplication operator mx defined by mxp x x p x is essentially self adjoint on c x in l 2 r in higher dimensions n 2 both statements are no longer equivalent and several determinate definitions appear see e g sch 17 ch 14 definition 2 28 let n n s s and be a representing measure of s the moment sequence s is called a determinate if the representing measure of s is unique b strictly determinate if s is determinate and c x 1 xn is dense in l 2 rn d c strongly determinate if s is determinate and c x 1 xn is dense in l 2 rn 1 x 2 i d for all i 1 n d ultradeterminate if s is determinate and c x 1 xn is dense in l 2 rn 1 x 21 x 2 n d we have the proper inclusions ultradeterminate strongly determinate strictly determinate determinate it remains open how these properties are preserved along the heat curves cs 3 time dependent moments from the transport equation tu ax u let a a 1 an t rn and ax a 1 x 1 1 anxn n the transport equation tu x t ax u x t u x 0 u 0 x 10 has the solution u x t u 0 x 1 e a 1 t xne ant 11 with the moments s t s 0 exp n i 1 ai i 1 t 12 time dependent moments from the heat equation 15 the moments 12 follow immediately from 11 by the transformation f x d t x f x d 0 x 1 e a 1 t xne ant f y 1 e a 1 t yne ant e a 1 an t d 0 y 13 all results in this section are a consequence of 13 in a way entirely similar to the heat equation case and recalling the associated polynomial p definition 2 3 we see that 12 can be used to define s t from s 0 without necessarily restricting attention to moment sequences definition 3 1 let n n d n a 1 an r and let s s 0 d be any sequence for all t r we define ts t ts t d by ts t s 0 exp n i 1 ai i 1 t 14 the 1 parameter family of sequences t fulfills the following relations lemma 3 2 for all a b t 1 t 2 r and sequences s and s we have i tas bs t a ts t b ts t and ii tts t 1 t 2 ts t 1 t 2 proof both statements follow directly from definition 3 1 i is a consequence of the linearity in s ii is straightforward after we recall the exp addition theorem ea b eaeb for a moment sequence truncated or not which is represented by an atomic measure we get the following result theorem 3 3 let n n d n and s sd if s is represented by 0 k i 1 ci 0 xi 0 with xi 0 xi 1 0 xi n 0 rn then ts t is represented by t k i 1 ci t xi t with ci t ci 0 exp n j 1 ajt and xi j t xi j 0 e ajt j 1 n for all t r proof straightforward from 13 in a way entirely analogous to the case of the heat curve cs of a moment sequence s definition 2 13 we define is for the transport equation and we also define the transport curve ts 16 time dependent moments from the heat equation definition 3 4 let n n d n and s sd let is t r ts t sd and define the transport curve by ts ts is sd from 13 and theorem 3 3 we get the following results corollary 3 5 let n n d n and s s d be a sequence the following are equivalent i s is a moment sequence ii ts t is a moment sequence for some t r iii ts t is a moment sequence for all t r i e we have for the transport equation 10 and s sd is r and ts ts r proof iii ii i is clear it is therefore sufficient to prove i iii i iii let s sd be a representing measure of s and t r by 13 we have that t x x 1 e a 1 t xne ant is a representing measure of ts t hence ts t has a non negative representing measure and is therefore a moment sequence ts t sd for all t r hence is r and ts ts is ts r corollary 3 6 let n n d n finite and s sd then the carathe odory number is constant on ts i e all moment sequences s ts have the same carathe odory number proof denote by c s the carathe odory number of s and by c s the carathe odory number of s ts t ts for some t r let 0 c s i 1 ci xi and 0 c s i 1 c i x i be finitely atomic representing measures for s and s where the minimal number of atoms i e carathe odory number is attained let t c s i 1 ci t xi t and t c s i 1 c i t x i t be the time evolved finitely atomic measures obtained from theorem 3 3 then t is a representing measure of s i e c s c s and t is a representing measure of s i e c s c s in summary we have c s c s and since s ts was arbitrary equality holds for all s ts corollary 3 7 let n n and s s determinacy resp strict determinacy strong determinacy ultradeterminacy the following statements are equivalent i s is determinate resp strictly determinate strongly determinate ultradeter minate ii there exists a s ts which is determinate resp strictly determinate strongly determinate ultradeterminate iii all s ts are determinate resp strictly determinate strongly determinate ultradeterminate time dependent moments from the heat equation 17 that is determinacy strict determinacy strong determinacy and ultradeterminacy are preserved on the transport curves ts proof all statements follow immediately from 13 we will show this for strong determinacy and i iii the other statements follow with the same arguments and similar calculations as in see below i iii let s be strongly determinate i e c x 1 xn is dense in l 2 rn 1 x 2 i d 0 x for all i 1 n where 0 is the representing measure of s and let s ts i e there exists t r such that s ts t let a rn be a compact set since s is strongly determinate there exists a sequence p k k n c x 1 xn such that p k k a x 1 e a 1 t xne ant in l 2 rn 1 x 2 i d 0 x for all i 1 n set pk x 1 xn p k x 1 e a 1 t xne ant c x 1 xn then 0 pk x a x 2 1 x 2 i d t x pk x a x 2 1 x 2 i d 0 x 1 ea 1 t xneant 13 pk y 1 e a 1 t yne ant a y 1 e a 1 t yne ant 2 1 y 2 i e 2 ait e a 1 an t d 0 y 1 yn p k y 1 yn a y 1 e a 1 t yne ant 2 1 y 2 i d 0 y 1 yn e a 1 an t sup yi r 1 y 2 i e 2 ait 1 y 2 i which converges to 0 as k hence c x 1 xn approximates the charac teristic function a for any compact a rn in l 2 rn 1 x 2 i d t x for all i 1 n i e we have proved 3 since s ts t t r was arbitrary since the transport operator ax only induces a deformation of rn by 13 the support of any measure is deformed in the same way additionally under this deformation polynomials remain polynomials and even sums of squares remain sums of squares we have the following consequence corollary 3 8 let n n d n and s s 2 d i if there is a p x c x r x 1 xn d such that ls p 2 0 then pt x c exp n i 1 ai it x r x 1 xn d fulfills lts t p 2 t 0 for all t r 18 time dependent moments from the heat equation ii if there is a p x c x r x 1 xn 2 d such that p 0 and ls p 2 0 then pt x c exp n i 1 ai it x 0 fulfills lts t pt 0 for all t r proof this follows immediately from 13 since in i and ii we have pt x p x 1 e ait xne ant r x 1 xn for all t r 4 concluding remarks observe that the operators and ax do not commute and hence the solution of the partial differential equation tu x t u x t ax u x t u x 0 u 0 x 15 is neither v x t t u 0 x 1 ea 1 t xneant nor w x t t u 0 x 1 ea 1 t xneant the exact solution u of 15 can be implicitly written down but explicit expressions are not possible in general however the moments of the solution u x t can be explicitly expressed by the moments of the initial data u 0 lemma 4 1 let n n a a 1 an rn 0 and u 0 s rn then the moments of the unique solution u x t of 15 are recursively determined by s t s 0 exp n j 1 aj j 1 t t 0 1 1 1 s 2 e 1 n n 1 s 2 en exp n j 1 aj j 1 d exp n j 1 aj j 1 t proof we have ts t rn x u x t ax u x t dx rn 1 1 1 x 2 e 1 n n 1 x 2 en u x t a 1 1 1 an n 1 x u x t dx 1 1 1 s 2 e 1 t n n 1 s n 2 en t a 1 1 1 an n 1 s t which is an inhomogeneous ordinary differential equation this proves the state ment time dependent moments from the heat equation 19 observe that the moments s t only depend on the initial moments s 0 with because of the simple structure of the differential operator ax example 4 2 for n a 1 we have s t s 0 e 1 t t 0 1 s 2 e 1 d e 1 t i e s 0 t s 0 0 e t s 1 t s 1 0 e 2 t s 2 t s 2 0 s 0 0 e 3 t s 0

3 s 1 0 e 4 t 3 s 1 0 e 2 t in 6 we have written down the moments for the one dimensional heat equation n 1 and a 0 and in 14 the moments for the transport equation 0 by comparing 6 and 14 with examples 4 2 and 4 3 especially by looking at the case t we find that the transport operator ax governs the long term behavior of the moments the matter of determinacy in its various degrees for the combination 15 is nontrivial although we know the situation well for both the heat and the transport equations theorem 2 23 corollary 2 25 and corollary 2 27 and corollary 3 7 respectively the equations for the combined moments indicate that there are very subtle considerations to be taken into account when analyzing determinacy for 15 we plan to pursue this matter in future research
