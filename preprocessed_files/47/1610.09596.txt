and preliminaries a bounded operator acting on a complex separable infinite dimensional hilbert space h is said to be normal if t t tt quasinormal if t commutes with t t subnormal if t n h where n is normal on a hilbert space k which contains h and nh h hyponormal if t t tt and 2 hyponormal if t t 2 is jointly hyponormal that is t t t 2 t t t 2 t 2 t 2 0 clearly normal quasinormal subnormal 2 hyponormal hyponormal in this paper we focus primarily on the casesh 2 t and a 2 d the hardy space on the unit circle t and the bergman space on the unit disk d respectively for these hilbert spaces we look at toeplitz operators that is the operators obtained by compressing multiplication operators on the respective l 2 spaces to the above mentioned hilbert spaces we consider possible versions in the bergman space context of c cowen s characterization of hyponormality for toeplitz operators on hardy space of the unit circle concretely we consider toeplitz operators on the bergman space of the unit disk with symbols of the form zn zm zp zq where c and m n p q z m n and p q by letting t act on vectors of the form zk cz dzr k r we study the asymptotic behavior of a suitable matrix of inner products as k as a result we obtain a sharp inequality involving the above mentioned data we begin with a brief survey of the known results in the hardy space context 2 the hardy space case let l 2 t denote the space of square integrable functions with respect to the lebesgue measure on the unit circle and let h 2 t denote the subspace consisting of functions with vanishing negative fourier coefficients equivalently h 2 t is the l 2 t closure of the space of analytic polynomials we also 2 let l t and h t denote the corresponding banach spaces of essentially bounded functions on t the orthogonal projection from l 2 t onto h 2 t will be denoted by p given l t the toeplitz operator with symbol is t h 2 t h 2 t given by t f p f f h 2 t t is said to be analytic if h t p r halmos s problem 5 9 asks whether every subnormal toeplitz op erator is either normal or analytic in 1984 c cowen and j long answered this question in the negative 4 along the way c cowen obtained a char acterization of hyponormality for toeplitz operators as follows 3 if l f g f g h 2 then t is hyponormal f c th g for some c c h h and h 1 t nakazi and k takahashi 17 later found an alter native description for l let e k h k 1 and k h then t is hyponormal e 6 for a generalization of cowen s result see 8 in this note we take a first step toward finding suitable gen eralizations of these results to the case of toeplitz operators on the bergman space over the unit disk we also wish to pursue appropriate generalizations of the results on joint hyponormality of pairs of toeplitz operators on the hardy space obtained in 6 and 5 at present there is no known characterization of subnormality of toeplitz operators in the unit circle in terms of the symbol however we do know that every 2 hyponormal toeplitz operator with a trigonometric symbol is sub normal 6 thus a suitable intermediate goal is to find a characterization of 2 hyponormality in terms of the symbol perhaps using as a starting point either cowen s or nakazi takahashi s characterizations of hyponormality for toeplitz operators with trigonometric symbols the following results de scribe hyponormality proposition 2 1 20 suppose z n k 0 akz k n k 0 bkz k with an 6 0 let c 0 c 1 c n 1 a 1 a 2 an 1 an a 2 a 3 an 0 an 0 0 0 b 1 b 2 bn then t is hyponormal if and only if k c 0 ck 1 0 k n 1 where k denotes the schur

for t hyponormal the rank of the self commutator of t is independent of those coefficients iv d farenick and w y lee 7 if m n and a m an 6 0 then t is hyponormal if and only if the following equation

bergman space case by analogy with the case of the unit circle let l l d h h d l 2 l 2 d and a 2 a 2 d denote the relevant spaces in the case of the unit disk d similarly let p l 2 a 2 denote the orthogonal projection onto the bergman space for l the toeplitz operator on the bergman space with symbol is t a 2 d a 2 d given by t f p f f a 2 t is said to be analytic if h 3 1 a revealing example let z 2 2 z on the hardy space h 2 t t is not hyponormal because m 2 n 1 and m n see proposition 2 2 however on the bergman space a 2 d t is hyponormal as we now prove consider a slight variation of the symbol that is 4 z 2 z c observe that t t f f 2 tz tz tz 2 tz 2 f f so that t is hyponormal if and only if 2 zf 2 p z 2 f z 2 f 2 p z f z f z 2 f 2 3 1 for all f a 2 d a calculation now shows that this happens precisely when 2 as follows for given f a 2 d f 0 bnz n one can apply lemma 3 1 and obtain zf 2 0 bn 2 n 2 p z f 2 1 bn 2 n n 1 2 z 2 f 2 0 bn 2 n 3 and p z 2 f 2 2 bn 2 n 1 n 1 2 thus 3 1 becomes 2 0 bn 2 n 2 2 bn 2 n 1 n 1 2 2 1 bn 2 n n 1 2 0 bn 2 n 3 3 2 in short equation 3 2 must hold for every sequence bn of coefficients of f consider first a sequence bn with b 0 1 and bn 0 for all n 1 by 3 1 we have 2 2 3 next take b 0 0 b 1 1 and bn 0 for all n 2 then 3 1 yields 2 3 finally if we fix k 2 and we use a sequence bn defined as b 0 0 b 1 0 bk 1 0 bk 1 and bn 0 for all n k then 3 2 becomes 2 k 2 k 1 k 1 2 2 k k 1 2 1 k 3 this immediately leads to the condition 2 4 k 2 k 3 all k 2 that is 2 4 as a result t is hyponormal if and only if 2 it follows that tz 2 2 z is hyponormal

hyponormality of a toeplitz operator acting on the bergman space although the calculation therein will be superseded by the calculations in the following section it serves both as a preliminary

tz a tza z k cz zk cz a 2 1 k 1 2 k 1 a c 2 1 1 2 1 a 3 5 self commutators we focus on the action of the self commutator c of certain toeplitz operators t on suitable vectors f in the space a 2 d the symbol and the vector f are of the form zn zm zp zq n m p q and f zk cz dzr k r respectively with and r to be determined later we also assume that n m q p our ultimate goal is to study the asymptotic behavior of this action as k goes to infinity thus we consider the expression cf f given by t zn zm zp zq t zn zm zp zq z k cz dzr zk cz dzr for large values of k and consequently large values of and r it is straight forward to see that cf f is a quadratic form in c and d that is cf f a 00 2 re a 10 c 2 re a 01 d a 20 cc 2 re a 11 cd a 02 dd 3 3 alternatively the matricial form of 3 3 is a 00 a 10 a 01 a 10 a 20 a 11 a 01 a 11 a 02 1 c d 1 c d 3 4 we now observe that the coefficient a 00 arises from the action of c on the monomial zk that is a 00 cz k z k t zn zm zp zq t zn zm zp zq z k z k 9 similarly a 10 cz z k a 01 czr zk 3 5 a 20 cz z a 11 czr z 3 6 a 02 cz r zr to calculate a 00 explicitly we first recall that the algebra of toeplitz oper ators with analytic symbols is commutative and therefore tzn commutes with tzm tzp and tzq we also recall that two monomials zu and zv are orthogonal whenever u 6 v as a result the only nonzero contributions to a 00 must come from the inner products t zn tzn z k zk t zm tzm z k zk t zp tzp z k zk and t zq tzq z k zk applying corollary 3 7 we see that a 00 1 k 1 2 2 n 2 k n 1 2 m 2 k m 1 2 p 2 k p 1 2 q 2 k q 1 similarly a 10 1 m 1 k m 1 k 1 1 n k m 1 n 1 k n 1 k 1 1 m k n 1 p 1 k p 1 k 1 1 q k p 1 q 1 k q 1 k 1 1 p k q 3 7 now recall that m n and k so that m k n and therefore m k n 0 also p q implies p k q so that p k q 0 as a consequence a 10 1 m 1 k m 1 k 1 1 n k m 1 p 1 k p 1 k 1 1 q k p 3 8 consider now a 01 as described in 3 5 we wish to imitate the calculation for a 10 observe that k r so that the vanishing of the relevant s in 3 7 still holds thus we obtain a 01 1 r m 1 k m 1 k 1 r 1 n k m r 1 r p 1 k p 1 k 1 r 1 q k p r 3 9 10 in short a 01 can be obtained from a 10 by replacing by r in a completely analogous way we can calculate a 11 by replacing by r and k by in 3 7 a 11 1 r m 1 m 1 1 r 1 n m r 1 r p 1 p 1 r 1 1 q p r 3 10 also a 20 and a 02 follow the pattern of a 00 a 20 1 1 2 2 n 2 n 1 2 m 2 m 1 2 p 2 p 1 2 q 2 q 1 and a 02 1 r 1 2 2 n 2 r n 1 2 m 2 r m 1 2 p 2 r p 1 2 q 2 r q 1 recall again that k r we now make a judicious choice to simplify the forms of a 10 a 11 and a 01 that is we let n k m and r q p it follows that n k m m r and q k q p r therefore both kronecker deltas appearing in a 01 are zero and thus a 01 0 moreover a 10 1 m 1 k m 1 k 1 1 3 11 1 p 1 k p 1 k 1 1 q k p 3 12 and a 11 1 r m 1 m 1 r 1 1 n m r 1 r p 1 p 1 r 1 1 the 3 3 matrix associated with c becomes m a 00 a 10 0 a 10 a 20 a 11 0 a 11 a 02 we now wish to study the asymptotic behavior of k 3 m as k surprisingly k 3 a 00 k 3 a 02 and k 3 a 20 all have the same limit as k also k 3 a 10 and k 3 a 11 have the same limit to see this observe that k 3 a 00 k 2 k 1 2 k 2 n 2 k n 1 k 2 m 2 k m 1 k 2 p 2 k p 1 k 2 q 2 k q 1 11 so that a lim k k 3 a 00 2 n 2 2 m 2 2 p 2 2 q 2 then limk k 3 a 20 limk k 3 a 02 a in terms of the remaining entries of k 3 m recall the assumption n m q p and let g n m q p it follows that k g and r g k 2 g by using these values in 3 11 we obtain k 3 a 10 k 3 mn k 1 k g 1 k g m 1 k 3 pq k 1 k g 1 k g p 1 so that lim k k 3 a 10 mn pq the calculation for a 11 is entirely similar and one gets limk k 3 a 11 it follows that the asymptotic behavior of k 3 m is given by the tridiagonal matrix a 0 a 0 a now if instead of using a vector of the form f zk cz dzr k r with k g and r g k 2 g that is a vector of the form f zk czk g dzk 2 g we were to use a longer vector with similar power structure fn z k c 1 z k g c 2 z k 2 g cnz k ng it is not hard to see that the asymptotic behavior of the associated matrix would still be given by the tridiagonal matrix with a in the diagonal and in the super diagonal to see this one only need to observe that the entries of the matrix p associated with cf f will follow the same pattern as the entries in m for example when n 3 the 3 4 entry of p will follow the pattern of a 10 above with and k replaced by k 3 g and k 2 g resp similarly the 2 4 entry of p will follow the pattern of a 01 above with r and k replaced by k 3 g and k g resp as a result it is straightforward to see that like a 01 the entry p 24 will be zero as for p 34 one gets p 34 1 k 3 g m 1 k 2 g m 1 k 2 g 1 k 3 g 1 n k 2 g m k 3 g 1 k 3 g p 1 k 2 g p 1 k 3 g 1 k 2 g 1 q k 2 g p k 3 g 3 13 12 as before k 3 p 34 k 3 mn k 2 g 1 k 3 g 1 k 3 g m 1 k 3 pq k 2 g 1 k 3 g 1 k 3 g p 1 and once again lim k k 3 p 34 mn pq in summary the hyponormality of t detected by the positivity of the self commutator c leads to the positive semi definiteness of the tridiagonal n 1 n 1 matrix p since this must be true for all n 1 it follows that a necessary condition for the hyponormality of t is the positive semi definiteness of the infinite tridiagonal matrix q a 0 a 0 a we now consider the spectral behavior of q as an operator on 2 z lemma 3 8 for a r and c the spectrum of the infinite tridiagonal matrix q is a 2 a 2 proof this result is well known we present a proof for the sake of complete ness observe that q is the canonical matrix representation of the toeplitz operator on h 2 t with symbol z a 2 re z since the symbol is harmonic it follows that the spectrum of t ai t z z is the set a 2 re z z d a 2 as desired as a consequence if q is positive as an operator on 2 z then a 2 3 6 main result theorem 3 10 assume that t is hyponormal on a 2 d with zn zm zp zq n m p q assume also that n m q p then 2 n 2 2 m 2 2 p 2 2 q 2 2 mn pq 3 14 13 3 7 a specific case when p m and q n in zn zm zp zq n m p q the inequality 2 n 2 2 m 2 2 p 2 2 q 2 2 mn pq reduces to n 2 2 2 m 2 2 2 2 mn this not only generalizes previous estimates but also sharpens them since previous results did not include the factor 2 in the right hand side 4 when is t normal we conclude this paper with a description of those symbols in theorem 3 10 which produce a normal operator t we first recall a result of s axler and z c uc kovic lemma 4 1 2 let be harmonic and bounded on d then t is normal if and only if there exist a pair of complex numbers a and b such that a b 6 0 0 and f a b is constant on d assume now that t is normal by lemma 4 1 there exist a and b such that a b 6 0 0 and f a b is constant in what follows we write a harmonic symbol as f g with f and g analytic a straightforward calculation using z and z applied to f shows that a 2 b 2 f z 0 if f is constant a similar calculation shows that g is also constant and a fortiori is constant thus without loss of generality we can assume that f is not constant and therefore a b 0 if we write a a ei and b a ei it is not hard to see that ei is constant on d let ei so that 1 we conclude that is constant on d theorem 4 2 let zn zm z p z q with n m p q n m q p and 6 0 0 0 0 then t is normal if and only if there exists t such that is of one of exactly three types i zn z n when n p ii zn zm z n z m when m p or iii zm z m when m q proof assume that t is normal from the discussion in the para graph immediately preceding theorem 4 2 we can always assume that is constant on d for some t since is clearly nonconstant we know that g is a constant trigonometric polynomial with analytic monomials zm zn zp and zq since is a nonconstant harmonic function in the above 14 mentioned list of four monomials we must necessarily have at least two identical monomials since m n p q and n m q p we are led to consider the following three cases i n p and therefore m n p q here g zm zn z q zm zn zq from which it easily follows that 0 and 0 then zn zn as desired ii m p and therefore m p q n here g zn zm zn zm so that 0 and 0 it readily follows that and we then get zn zm zn zm as desired iii m q which leads to zm zm for the converse observe that in each of the three representations we have 0 which implies t t therefore t commutes with t so t is normal the proof is now complete remark 4 4 the form of i ii and iii in theorem 4 2 is entirely consis tent with theorem 3 10 for instance consider case i here 0 and so that both sides of 3 14 are equal to 0 references 1 p ahern and z c uc kovic a mean value inequality with applications to bergman space operators pacific j math 173 1996 295 305 2 s axler and z c uc kovic
