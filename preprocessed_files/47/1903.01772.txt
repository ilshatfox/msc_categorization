communicated by hari bercovici abstract a continuous linear hilbert space operator s is said to be a 2 isometry if the operator s and its adjoint s satisfy the relation s 2 s 2 2 s s i 0 in this paper we study hilbert space operators having liftings or di lations to 2 isometries the adjoint of an operator which admits such liftings is characterized as the restriction of a backward shift on a hilbert space of vector valued analytic functions these results are applied to concave opera tors i e operators s such that s 2 s 2 2 s s i 0 and to operators similar to contractions or isometries two

of hilbert space contractions operators of norm no greater than one have been basic objects of study in operator theory this is witnessed for instance by the central role played by isometric liftings and unitary dilations in the celebrated monographs 17 and 39 for further considerations it is useful to keep in mind that every isometry can be written as a direct sum of a shift and a unitary operator the wold decomposition theorem and that contractions have isometric liftings and unitary dilations starting with a series of three papers 2 4 by agler and stankus a rich theory of 2 isometries has been developed in recent years a 2 isometry is a hilbert space operator t which satisfies the second order difference condition t 2 x 2 2 tx 2 x 2 0 for every x instead of the classical first order con dition tx 2 x 2 0 satisfied by isometries the dirichlet shift is an example http arxiv org abs 1903 01772 v 4 102 c badea and l suciu of a 2 isometry which is not an isometry operators arising from a certain class of nonstationary stochastic processes related to brownian motion brownian uni taries play an essential role in the theory of 2 isometries of agler and stankus the same that unitary operators play for isometries the fact that a 2 isometry has an extension to a brownian unitary has been proved in 3 theorem 5 80 as an analogue of the wold decomposition theorem for isometries it has been proved in 29 see also 31 that a pure 2 isometry is unitarily equivalent to a shift operator multiplication by the independent variable on a dirichlet space d corresponding to a positive operator measure on the unit circle the aim of this paper is to undertake a systematic study of operators pos sessing 2 isometric liftings this class of operators denoted c 2 can be viewed as the class of 2 contractions to give a flavor of the results obtained in this paper we mention now several sample results in theorem 2 1 we give a characteriza tion of adjoints of operators in c 2 as restrictions of a backward shift operator on some hilbert spaces of vector valued analytic functions we also prove that op erators in c 2 are compressions to semi invariant subspaces of analytic brownian unitaries an analogue of the von neumann inequality is obtained in theorem 2 1 iii with the shift operator on a dirichlet space d as an extremal opera tor for a bounded linear concave operator t acting on a complex hilbert space h that is one which satisfies the condition t 2 x 2 2 tx 2 x 2 0 for every x h it is proved in theorem 3 10 below that t has a 2 isometric lifting s acting on a larger hilbert space k such that s k h is an isometry on k h and s s i t t i moreover the 2 isometric lifting s is minimal in the usual sense 1 b basic definitions and notation throughout this paper b h h de notes the banach space of all bounded linear operators acting from a complex hilbert space h into another one h and b h is a short for b h h for an operator t b h h its adjoint operator in b h h is denoted by t while r t and n t stand for the range respectively the kernel of t an operator t is a contraction if t t i where i ih is the identity operator on h the operator t is an isometry if t t i and t is unitary if it is an isometry with r t h for a closed subspace m of h the orthogonal projection in b h with the range m is denoted by pm the subspace m is invariant reducing for t b h if tm m respectively tm m and t m m an isometry t on h is pure or a shift operator if there is no subspace m 6 0 in h that reduces t to a unitary operator an operator t on h is said to be positive in notation t 0 if th h 0 for every h h here denotes the inner product when t is positive t 1 2 stands for the positive square root of t for a contraction t b h h the operator dt ih t t 1 2 b h and its closed range dt r dt are called the defect operator respectively the defect space of t operators with two isometric dilations 103 an operator z b h h is invertible whenever n z 0 and r z h an operator z b h h intertwines t b h with t b h if zt t z the operators t and t are similar respectively unitarily equivalent whenever an intertwining relation zt t z holds with an invertible respectively unitary operator z whenever zt t z with z an isometry one says that t is an extension of t to h or that t is a restriction of t on h if this holds one has t z z t and one says that t is a lifting of t in these cases t is unitarily equivalent to t 0 t r z while t is unitarily equivalent to t 0 thus if we identify h with zh into h then t becomes an extension of t from the subspace h of h to h while z is the embedding mapping jh h of h into h in this way we can consider only extensions and liftings of operators on h to another hilbert spaces containing h then the intertwining relations become jh h t t jh h respec tively ph ht t ph h where ph h j h h b h h is the projection of h onto h while the inclusion h h means that h is a closed subspace of h according to 17 two liftings s 1 on k 1 h and s 2 on k 2 h of an oper ator t on h are called isomorphic if there exists a unitary operator z b k 1 k 2 such that zs 1 s 2 z and z h i i e s 1 and s 2 are unitarily equivalent by z and z fixes the elements of h for a lifting s on k of t one considers the subspace k 0 n 0 s nh i e the smallest invariant subspace for s in k that contains h let s 0 s k 0 be the restriction of s to k 0 clearly s 0 is also a lifting of t on k 0 and it is called a minimal lifting of t let h be a closed subspace of a hilbert space k the compression of r b k to h is defined as t pk hrjh k phr h recall the following useful result due to sarason see 39 the operator r is a power dilation of t that is tn phr n h for all positive integers n if and only if the subspace h is semi invariant for r that is h h 1 h 2 for two invariant subspaces h 1 and h 2 of r according to 33 if t b h is a fixed left invertible operator i e injective and with closed range then t t t t 1 is called the cauchy dual operator of t clearly t is also left invertible and t t t t i so t is the cauchy dual operator of t and n t n t e obviously e is a wandering subspace for t that is e tne for each n 1 1 c two isometries in this paper we are interested in 2 isometric liftings for operators in b h we refer to 2 7 11 19 23 24 26 29 33 35 37 for different aspects of 2 isometries recall that an operator t on h is a 2 isometry if it satisfies the condition t tt t where t t t i in this case t is called the operator of covariance and cov t t 1 2 is the covariance of t clearly cov t 0 if and only if t is an isometry if t is a 2 isometry then t 0 which means that t is an expansive operator a 2 isometry t that is power bounded i e supn n tn 104 c badea and l suciu is necesarily an isometry also n t is an invariant subspace for a 2 isometry t and v t n t is an isometry so the canonical matrix representation of t on h n t r t has the form 1 1 t v e 0 y with v e 0 this yields t 0 e e y with 0 e e y t r t an injective operator moreover using that t tt t one obtains y 0 y 0 some special 2 isometries introduced by agler and stankus called brown ian isometries and unitaries play a special role in our investigations namely t is called a brownian isometry if in the block matrix 1 1 one has e e 0 where e 0 is an injective contraction from r t into n v cov t and y is a unitary operator which commutes with e e cf 3 proposition 5 37 also t is called a brownian unitary if e 0 is an isometry with r e 0 n v and y is unitary cf 3 proposition 5 12 using the above relationships between t and t respectively y and 0 we see that 2 isometries are closely related to a contractions defined as follows when t a b h with a 0 the operator t is said to be an a contraction if t at a and t is an a isometry if t at a thus 2 isometries are t isometries and the concave operators are t contractions but many other classes of operators can be viewed as a contractions for suitable operators a a contractions and a isometries frequently appear in operatorial interpolation and robust control problems based on the commutant lifting theory see 13 17 18 or in other topics of operator theory 10 14 16 20 27 32 34 38 40 1 d organization of the paper following 33 we give in the next section a characterization of the adjoints of operators in the class c 2 as restrictions of a backward shift on some spaces of vector valued analytic functions this implies that operators in c 2 always have analytic 2 isometric liftings an analogue of the von neumann inequality for operators in the class c 2 is also obtained further more in the case of analytic brownian unitaries we refine the richter olofsson model by taking into account additional spectral information in section 3 we describe those operators having 2 isometric liftings among the operators in the class of a isometries t with a t special features of such liftings called of type i are investigated we apply our results to a class of expansive operators containing concave operators and to operators similar to isometries in particular for these expansive operators we give a generalization of the extension theorem of agler and stankus 3 theorem 5 80 the use of the treil volberg generalization of the commutant lifting theorem is to be mentioned here in section 4 we study operators t c 2 in the context of a contractions with a t such liftings called of type ii are more general than those from section operators with two isometric dilations 105 3 we show that these liftings like those from section 3 can be always chosen to be minimal the results can be applied to operators similar to contractions we also discuss some conditions for two minimal 2 isometric liftings to be isomor phic two examples are given in order to show that some operators similar to contractions may or may not have 2 isometric liftings of type i 1 e an open problem we end this introduction by mentioning the following problem let m 0 be a real number consider the class c 2 m of hilbert space operators which have 2 isometric liftings of covariance less than or equal to m then c 2 m is a family in the sense of agler s abstract approach to model theory see 1 it is an interesting problem to find the boundary and the extremal elements of the family c 2 m see 1 for the undefined terms we hope to return to this problem in the future 2 characterizations of c 2 and analytic 2 isometric liftings assume that the left invertible operator s b h is analytic that is h n 1 snh 0 let s s s s 1 be the cauchy dual operator of s then as in 33 one can associate to h a hilbert space of e valued analytic functions h for h h where e n s and h z n 0 pes nh zn z r s 1 r s being the spectral radius of s consider d h h h as a hilbert space with the norm induced by h in this case the operator from h onto d is an isometry such that s m where m is the forward shift on d i e md z zd z for d d also one has s b where b is the backward shift on d i e bd z 1 z d z d 0 d d it was proved in 33 theorem 3 6 that a concave operator s not necessary analytic admits a wold type decomposition in the sense that h h n 0 sne in this case the operators s and s are simultaneously analytic when this hap pens one can associate to h another hilbert space d of e valued analytic func tions h where h z n 0 pes nh zn h h z 1 the operator isometrically maps h onto d such that s m and s b where m b is the forward backward shift on d the space d is the 106 c badea and l suciu dual of d with respect to the cauchy pairing see also 33 in this way s can be identified by with the adjoint of the forward shift m on d or with the backward shift b on d by it is also known that the space d is a bergman space if and only if s i s s see 29 and 19 theorem 3 1 in addition if s is a 2 isometry then by 29 the associated space d be comes a dirichlet type space d of e valued analytic functions on the open unit disk d obtained with respect to some positive b e valued operator mea sure on the unit circle t we refer to 29 3 1 for a description of the norm in d induced by in general if m is the forward shift on a dirichlet type space d then m is an analytic 2 isometry see 29 theorem 3 1 while the operator m can be seen as the forward shift on the associated hilbert space d of n m valued analytic functions on d d being the dual of d with respect to the cauchy pairing as above the backward shift b in d is unitarily equivalent to m in d the following result characterizes membership into the class c 2 theorem 2 1 for t b h the following statements are equivalent i t is an element of the class c 2 that is t has a 2 isometric lifting ii t has an analytic 2 isometric lifting iii there is an operator valued positive measure on t such that the inequality pij t mn b h pij mz mn b d holds true for all finite matrices of polynomials pij where mz is the multi plication by the variable z on d and mn b h the set of n n matrices with entries in b h is identified with the set of bounded linear operators act ing on h n the 2 sum of n copies of h iv t has a brownian unitary power dilation v t has an analytic brownian unitary dilation vi t is unitarily equivalent to the restriction to an invariant subspace of the back ward shift b on a hilbert space d of vector valued analytic functions on d d being in cauchy pairing to a dirichlet type space d moreover if these conditions hold then the lifting in ii for t can be chosen min imal also the liftings and brownian unitary dilations in i ii iv and v can be chosen to have the same covariance proof the implication i iv follows from 3 theorem 5 80 using the fact that an extension of a lifting for t gives a power dilation for t let us now assume iv that is t has a brownian unitary dilation s on k h because s is not necessarily analytic we can write s as a direct sum s u 0 s 1 on k k k 1 where k n 1 s nk and u 0 s k is unitary while s 1 s k 1 is an analytic brownian unitary but u 0 can be lifted to a brownian unitary s 0 on a hilbert space k 0 2 r e k operators with two isometric dilations 107 where e b k is an isometry then s 0 has the following block matrix form s 0 s e 0 u 0 with s the forward shift on k 0 2 r e and e je where cov s and j is the embedding of r e into k 0 clearly s 0 has not any isometric summand s being a shift with r e n s hence s 0 is analytic consider the operator s s 0 s 1 on k k 0 k 1 to see that s is a brownian unitary operator we use the matrix representation of s 1 on k 1 n s 1 r s 1 k 2 k 3 similar to that of s 0 from above given by a for ward shift s on k 2 a unitary operator u 1 on k 3 and an operator e 1 e 1 with as above and e 1 an isometry from k 3 onto n s thus we can represent s on k k 0 k 2 k k 3 k 0 k 2 k k 3 respectively in the form 2 1 s s 0 e 0 0 s 0 e 1 0 0 u 0 0 0 0 0 u 1 s g 0 u here s s s is a forward shift u u 0 u 1 is a unitary and g g with g an isometry from k k 3 onto n s in k 0 k 2 being as above hence s is an analytic brownian unitary with cov s cov s since s is a power dilation for t we infer from the representation 2 1 that s is also a power dilation for t this concludes the proof that iv implies v it is a known fact that from a power dilation s for t one can obtain a lifting s for t as a restriction of s to an invariant subspace see 17 furthermore if s is brownian unitary then s is a 2 isometry and s is analytic if s is because the analyticity is preserved on invariant subspaces hence v implies ii next we assume ii let s be an analytic 2 isometric lifting on k h for t then by 29 theorem 4 1 and using the same notation as in the introduction we obtain a b e valued positive measure on the unit circle such that s is unitarily equivalent to the forward shift m mz on a dirichlet space d of e valued analytic functions on d where e n s it follows that m is an extremal operator in the sense of iii conversely if iii holds then using the terminology of 8 t is completely polynomially dominated by m using 8 theorem 2 1 3 we get that t is unitarily equivalent to the compression of an operator r to a semi invariant subspace r being the image of m by a unital c representation it follows that r is a 2 isometry and thus t is in the class c 2 that is t satisfies i so the equivalences i v are proved next we assume ii then again s is an analytic 2 isometric lifting on k h for t unitarily equivalent to the forward shift m on a dirichlet space d of e valued analytic functions on d also s is unitarily equivalent to the backward shift b on the hilbert space d k k k of e valued analytic 108 c badea and l suciu functions of the form k z n 1 pes nk zn z 1 since s h t it follows that b h t h for h h hence the closed subspace d 0 h h h is invariant for b because the operator from k onto d is an isometry and s b we infer that 0 h is an isometry from h onto d 0 and 0 t b d 0 0 hence t is unitarily equivalent to b d 0 and we conclude that ii implies vi conversely let us assume that t is unitarily equivalent to b 0 b d 0 where b is as in vi and d 0 is an invariant subspace of b the cauchy pairing between the space d where b acts and the dirichlet type space d ensures that b is unitarily equivalent to m the adjoint of the forward shift on d since m is a 2 isometry on d by 29 theorem 3 1 it induces a 2 isometry b on d which is a lifting for b 0 b being an extension of b 0 in the same time t is unitarily equivalent to b 0 by our assumption we deduce that t has b as a analytic 2 isometric lifting on d we have thus shown that vi implies ii in conclusion all equivalences i vi are now proved remark that by 3 theorem 5 80 a 2 isometry s has a brownian unitary extension s which preserves the covariance of s and as we already have seen cov s can be also preserved for an analytic brownian unitary extension of s on the other hand if s is a 2 isometric lifting for t then as in the proof of implication iv v s can be lifted to an analytic 2 isometry of the same covariance as s thus in all assertions i ii iv and v we can obtain 2 isometric liftings and dilations for t of the same covariance finally if s is an analytic 2 isometric lifting for t on k h as in ii then k 0 n 0 s nh is an invariant subspace for s and s k 0 is a minimal ana lytic 2 isometric lifting for t with 0 cov s k 0 cov s however by the above discussion we can get an analytic brownian unitary dilation s for t with cov s 0 this ends the proof corollary 2 2 if t b h is an operator similar to a contraction then t and t are restrictions to invariant subspaces of backward shifts on hilbert spaces of vector valued analytic functions on d the following theorem refines the model of a olofsson 29 for analytic brownian unitaries by theorem 2 1 v every operator in c 2 has an analytic brownian unitary dilation theorem 2 3 let s b k be an analytic brownian unitary acting on k let e n s and let be the positive b e valued measure defined on the algebra bor t of all borel subsets of t by 2 2 pef s e bor t operators with two isometric dilations 109 where f is the b r s valued spectral measure on t of the unitary operator u with u s r s then s is unitarily equivalent to the forward shift on the dirichlet space d k k k of e valued analytic functions on d where 2 3 k z n 0 pes nk zn z d s being the cauchy dual operator of s and the norm on d is induced by as in 29 3 1 moreover if e 0 1 pn s s r s and cov s then 2 4 e 1 e 0 u d d d r s and 1 2 4 is an orthogonal projection for every bor t proof let u be the unitary operator on r s with u s r s and let f bor t b r s be the spectral measure of u since s 0 2 i on n s r s where cov s we have 1 2 s sk 1 2 s uk u 1 2 s k for k r s the second relation ensures that 1 2 s f k f 1 2 s k for k r s thus as in 29 lemma 4 1 we can associate to s a positive b e valued measure on t which in this case has the form 2 2 where e n s also corresponding to this measure one can define the dirichlet space d with the norm induced by as in 29 3 1 by 29 theorem 4 1 we obtain that s is unitarily equivalent via the operator k d from 2 3 with the forward shift on d in addition in this case the subspace e of k can be easily determined and we are able to obtain more information about the measure indeed let us con sider the canonical matrix representation of the form 1 1 of s on k n s r s where v s n s is a shift operator s being analytic y u is as before and e e 0 with e 0 an isometry from r s onto n v then an element k k 0 k 1 n s r s belongs to e n s if and only if v k 0 0 and e 0 k 0 u k 1 0 since n v r e 0 it follows that k 0 e 0 d 0 for some element d 0 r s while the previous equality yields k 1 ud 0 considering d 0 of the form d 0 1 u d with d r s we infer that e has the form 2 4 now let e e and d r s be such that e 1 e 0 u d d then 1 2 d e 2 e 0 u d uu d e 2 s u d it follows that ped 2 1 2 e 2 1 2 1 e 0 u d d d r s 110 c badea and l suciu thus for bor t and e e as above we obtain e pef se 2 pef pr s e 2 pef d 4 1 2 1 e 0 u f d f d 4 1 2 1 e 0 f e 0 e 0 u d f d 4 1 2 e 0 f e 0 pn s e f pr s e 4 1 2 e 0 f e 0 f e 0 e 1 where e 0 pn s e e 1 pr s e finally keeping in mind that f is a spectral measure so f 2 f we obtain 1 2 4 2 e e 0 f e 0 f e 0 f e 0 e 0 f e 1 e 0 f 2 e 0 e 0 f 2 e 1 e 0 f e 0 e 0 f e 1 1 2 4 e for every bor t and e e since 1 2 4 is a contraction we conclude that 1 2 4 is an orthogonal projection for bor t this ends the proof remark 2 4 v m ller proved in 28 corollary 2 3 that if h is a separable hilbert space then for any operator t b h t and t are unitarily equivalent with restrictions to invariant subspaces of a backward weighted shift b b k where k 2 h and h is a separable hilbert space recall that such an operator b is defined with respect to a bounded sequence of positive numbers n n 1 by the relation b xn n 0 nxn n 1 for all square summable sequences xn n 0 k of vectors xn h so the operators t and t can be lifted to the forward weighted shift s b on k which is an analytic operator but s is not 2 isometric in general 3 two isometric liftings of type i 3 a type i and type ii liftings let t b h and suppose that s b k is a lifting of t on k h then the canonical representation of s on k h h has the form 3 1 s w x 0 t operators with two isometric dilations 111 with w s h and x ph s h in general the operators w x and t can be arbitrary but they have to satisfy some constraints whenever s belongs to some particular classes of operators here we are interested in the case when s is a 2 isometry in this case w is also a 2 isometry as a restriction to an invariant subspace for s and s has the form 3 2 s w w x x w x x t since necessarily s 0 and w 0 one also has x x t 0 therefore see 17 18 there exists a contraction r x x t r w such that 3 3 w x 1 2 w x x t 1 2 this relation gives x w n w 0 which by 3 2 implies that s n w 0 hence n w n s but n w is invariant for w s h and so for s while w n w s n w is an isometry when w is an isometry on h one has h n w n s therefore w x 0 in this case conversely if h n s then since h is invariant for s by 3 1 it follows that w s h is an isometry on the other hand we see from 3 3 that w x 0 if and only if 0 because r r w notice however that in general it is difficult to have significant information about the operator using 3 2 one has w x 0 if and only if h is invariant for s s in this case by 3 2 we have n s n w n x x t in particular if x x t 0 which forces t and x to be contractions as d 2 t x x 0 then w x 0 in this case it is easy to see that s is an extension of the minimal isometric lifting of t because n s n w h is an invariant subspace for s in light of the preceding discussion we introduce the following definition definition 3 1 using the previous notation we say that a 2 isometry s of the form 3 1 on k h h is a lifting of type i for t whenever h n s we say that s is a lifting of type ii for t whenever h is an invariant subspace for s s observe that s sh h if and only if w x 0 in 3 3 hence a lifting of type i is also a lifting of type ii 3 b a isometries we describe now the operators which have 2 isometric lift ings of type i these operators form a special class of a isometries as follows theorem 3 2 for t b h the following statements are equivalent i t has a 2 isometric lifting of type i on a hilbert space containing h ii t is either an a isometry for a positive operator a 6 0 on h with t a or t is a strongly stable contraction 112 c badea and l suciu iii t has an extension t on a hilbert space m h with t of the form 3 4 t c e 0 u on a decomposition m m 0 m 1 where c e are contractions u is uni tary and is a positive scalar such that there exist a hilbert space m and isometries j 0 dc m j 1 de m satisfying the condition 3 5 dc j 0 j 1 de c e 0 iv t has a 2 isometric lifting s of the form 3 1 such that 3 6 x w x 2 re x w xt 0 moreover if these statements are true then the lifting s of t in i and iv can be chosen minimal with cov s a 1 2 for a from ii or with cov s for from 3 4 proof let s b k be a 2 isometry as in 3 1 with k h n s thus w s k h is an isometry then w 0 and as we noticed before one has w x 0 therefore the condition 3 6 from iv is satisfied for such a lifting s of t we obtain that i implies iv assume that t has a 2 isometric lifting s on k h of the form 3 1 with the operators w and x then s ss s and this implies by 3 1 and 3 2 the relation 3 7 x w x 2 re x w xt t x x t t x x t now if s verifies the condition 3 6 then one obtains from 3 7 that t is an a isometry where a x x t 0 as s 0 in 3 2 and so a t this condition in the case a 0 forces t to be a contraction but in this case t is an a 0 isometry with a 0 s limn t ntn t d 2 t here the case a 0 0 corresponds to t being strongly stable i e tnh 0 for h h we have proved that iv implies ii next let t be an operator as in ii i e satisfying t at a with 0 6 a 0 and a t then the operator at a t is positive and one can suppose at 6 0 or in other words t is not a 2 isometry we define the lifting sa t of t on the space ha t 2 r at h with the block matrix 3 8 sa t s a t 0 t where s is the forward shift on 2 r at and a t ja 1 2 t j being the canon ical injection of r at into 2 r at then on the above decomposition of ha t we have sa t 0 at t 0 a operators with two isometric dilations 113 therefore s a t sa t sa t 0 t at 0 a sa t hence sa t is a 2 isometry and sa t ha t h s is an isometry we conclude that sa t is a 2 isometric lifting of type i for t in the case when t is a contraction it has even an isometric lifting so of type i and of covariance zero as a 2 isometry in this case if t at a 6 0 then a 1 2 t dt therefore r at dt r at dt using this and 3 8 one infers that sa t is a 2 isometric lifting of type i for t and for the minimal isometric lifting of t but when t is a strongly stable contraction t cannot be an a isometry with a 6 0 so at d 2 t and sa t is even the minimal isometric lifting of t hence ii implies i and thus the assertions i ii and iv are equivalent we also remark that cov sa t a 1 2 6 0 and thus cov sa t 0 a 0 when t is a strongly stable contraction now we show that sa t is a minimal lifting of t that is we have ha t n 0 s n a th to see this let k d h ha t with h h and d 0 dj 2 r at be such that k is orthogonal to n 0 s n a th as k h it follows that h 0 so k d sa th a th th working in the space r at we have d 0 a 1 2 t h and thus d 0 0 by induction one obtains dj 0 for each j 1 consequently k d 0 thus the minimality condition is true the final part of the proof consists in showing the equivalence of i with iii assume that s is a 2 isometric lifting of t on k of covariance with v s k h an isometry without loss of generality we can assume 0 otherwise s is an isometry and so t is a contraction hence t has trivially the form 3 4 then by 3 theorem 5 80 s has a brownian unitary extension s on k k of covariance with the canonical representation on k n s r s of the form s v e 0 u here v e are isometries with n v r e and u is unitary now s as an extension of s has on the decomposition k k h h k k a block matrix of the form s v 0 t 0 0 since s k h v is an isometry and s is a 2 isometry it follows that h k h n s and v h v inserting v into the matrix representation of s on k h n s h r s we get s v c e 0 c e 0 0 u 114 c badea and l suciu here we have represented the isometries v on h m 0 where m 0 n s h and e from m 1 r s into h m 0 as v v c 0 c e e e where c c e and e are contractions satisfying v e v e c e c e 0 also we have v c 0 because v and v are isometries comparing the two 3 3 matrices of s we infer t 0 h k k pk h s k h c e 0 u m 0 m 1 the two block matrices being given on two different decompositions of m k h hence t has an extension on m m 0 m 1 of the form 3 4 it remains now to verify the condition 3 5 indeed since v and e are isometries we have c c c c im 0 and e e e e im 1 therefore c c d 2 c and e e d 2 e since v c 0 and v e 0 we have r c r e n v m thus we infer by polar decompositions that c j 0 dc and e j 1 de where j 0 j 1 are isometries from dc respectively from de into m so j 0 and j 1 are the canonical mappings of dc r c onto r c re spectively of de r e onto r e in the space m finally the condition v e 0 implies c e c e 0 which becomes dc j 0 j 1 de c e 0 i e the condition 3 5 we completed the proof that i implies iii conversely let us assume that t has an extension t of the form 3 4 on m m 0 m 1 as in iii we denote by d the operator d j 0 dc j 1 de from m 0 m 1 into m consider also the operator j from m into m 2 2 r d defined as the canonical injection of r d into m 2 let d c j j 0 dc d e j j 1 de and let s be the minimal lifting of t acting on the space m m 2 m 0 m 1 defined by the block matrix s v f 0 u here v on m 2 m 0 and f from m 1 into m 2 m 0 have the representations v s d c 0 c f d e e where s is the forward shift on m 2 while u c e and 0 are as in 3 4 it is clear that v and f are isometries and that v f s d e d cd e c e 0 dc j 0 j 1 de c e 0 operators with two isometric dilations 115 taking into account that n s jr d r d e and using the relation 3 5 thus one obtains s 0 2 im 1 and we conclude that s is a 2 isometry in fact even a brownian isometry with 2 s an orthogonal projection expressing now t in the matrix of its extension t on m h m h in the form t t 0 and then inserting t in the matrix of s as a lifting of t we infer that the subspace h m 2 h is invariant for s and that s s h is a 2 isometric lifting for t with s m 2 s an isometry so t satisfies i in addition since s s h h we get s ph s h and cov s if h m 1 6 0 then cov s while if h m 0 then t is a contraction and s v h is an isometry with cov s 0 notice that by construction s is not minimal one can consider s 0 s k 0 where k 0 n 0 s nh since k 0 is reducing for s see remark 4 10 below it follows that s 0 is a minimal 2 isometric lifting of type i for t with cov s 0 hence iii implies i and all assertions are now proved it is easy to see that every operator t of the form 3 4 on h h 0 h 1 is a ph 1 isometry in addition one has 2 ph 1 t d 2 c c e e c 2 d 2 e thus when the condition 3 5 holds i e c e dc j 0 j 1 de the above matrix is positive hence 2 ph 1 t applying for such an operator t the arguments used in the proof of equivalences of i with ii and iii we deduce the following result corollary 3 3 for t b h the following statements are equivalent i t has the form 3 4 and the condition 3 5 holds true ii t is a p isometry for an orthogonal projection p with 2 p t and some scalar 0 iii t has a minimal brownian isometric lifting s of type i with 2 s an or thogonal projection and cov s an application of theorem 3 2 concerns the a 2 expansive operators stud ied in 20 which in fact are the a t contractions where a t t at a and a is a positive operator we obtain the following consequence corollary 3 4 let t b h be an invertible a 2 expansive operator such that a t or a t 1 then t respectively t 1 have minimal 2 isometric liftings of type i proof from hypothesis and 20 theorem 3 10 ii it follows that t at a or equivalently t 1 at 1 a thus one can apply theorem 3 2 to t if a t respectively to t 1 if a t 1 to obtain the conclusion 116 c badea and l suciu remark 3 5 theorem 3 2 can be seen as a generalization of the well known theorem of isometric lifting of a contraction see 17 39 the operator sa t in 3 8 is a minimal 2 isometric lifting of t on the space k 2 r at h while in the case when t is a contraction corresponding to a 0 in ii the operator s 0 t is the minimal isometric lifting of t but the 2 isometric lifting sa t with a 6 0 is not uniquely determined by the minimality condition up to unitary equivalence which fixes h as we will see in the next section this happens even for contractions t with a s limn t ntn 6 0 when we consider the corre sponding lifting s a t in this case t a t a t d 2 t then a t a d 2 t and s a t is a minimal 2 isometric lifting of t of covariance a 1 2 0 so s a t is not isometric hence s a t cannot be unitarily equivalent to s 0 t remark 3 6 the condition 3 5 does not imply the condition c e 0 in general but the converse implication holds by choosing j 0 j 1 such that the subspaces j 0 dc and j 1 de are orthogonal in m therefore the operators t of the form 3 4 with the condition c e 0 form a special class of operators with brownian isometric liftings of type i having the covariance operators the scalar multiples of orthogonal projections by corollary 3 3 we mention here two spe cial cases if c is a coisometry in 3 4 then 3 5 implies e 0 hence the operator c u is a contraction also if c or e are isometries then the two conditions 3 5 and c e 0 are simultaneously satisfied 3 c expansive operators the case when c the upper left entry of the matrix 3 4 is an isometry is related to expansive operators recall that t is said to be expansive if t t i theorem 3 7 for t b h the following statements are equivalent i t is expansive and has a minimal 2 isometric lifting of type i ii t is an a contraction for some a b h such that a t 0 iii t has an extension t defined on a hilbert space k which on an orthogonal decomposition k k 0 k 1 has the form 3 9 t v e 0 u with v an isometry on k 0 u a unitary operator on k 1 e a contraction from k 1 into k 0 satisfying v e 0 and t 1 2 moreover if these statements are true then one can chose t in 3 9 with a 1 2 for a as in ii proof we may assume that t is non isometric i e t 6 0 it is clear that i implies ii by theorem 3 2 conversely let us assume that t at a with a t 0 as in ii then there exists a contraction t on r a such that t a 1 2 h a 1 2 th for h h in fact defining the operator a 0 h r a by a 0 h a 1 2 h h h we have a 0 t t a 0 operators with two isometric dilations 117 let v on h r a be the minimal isometric lifting of t then as t t i by the treil volberg generalization of the commutant lifting theorem see 13 18 40 there exists an operator a b h h with a a 0 such that ph r a a a 0 a t v a defining b b h by b a a we have t bt b i e t is a b isometry with b a and b a 0 a 0 a t 0 hence ii implies i by theorem 3 2 to show that i implies iii we can suppose by theorem 3 2 i that t is a b isometry with b t 0 then there exists an isometry w on r b satisfying the relation wb 1 2 b 1 2 t let us denote b 0 b 1 b since t is expansive and a b 0 isometry we have t i b 0 t t t b 0 i b 0 and then by douglas lemma 15 one obtains a contraction c on h satisfying the relation i b 0 1 2 t i b 0 1 2 c this together with the relation b t yield the inequality t i b 0 1 2 i cc i b 0 1 2 t t t i b b b 0 consider v on k 0 h to be the minimal isometric lifting of c therefore pk 0 hv cpk 0 h define the linear operator e 0 r b 1 2 k 0 by the relation e 0 b 1 2 0 h i vv i b 0 1 2 th h h since v h c from the above relations one obtains e 0 b 1 20 h 2 i vv i b 0 1 2 th i b 0 1 2 th i cc i b 0 1 2 th i b 0 1 2 th th h bh h setting e 1 1 e 0 where b 1 2 t 1 2 the previous inequality be comes e 1 b 1 2 h b 1 2 h h h so e 1 can be continuously extended to a contraction also denoted e 1 from r b into k 0 in addition by the definition of e 0 one has v e 1 0 let now u be the minimal unitary extension of the above isometry w on k 1 n 0 u nr b and let e k 1 k 0 be a contractive extension of e 1 to k 1 for example e e 1 p where p pk 1 r b is the projection of k 1 onto r b clearly one has v e 0 118 c badea and l suciu consider the hilbert space k k 0 k 1 and the operator t b k having the block matrix 3 9 with the above operators v u e and number define now the operator z h k with r z k 0 r b by the relation zh i b 0 1 2 h b 1 20 h h h obviously z is an isometry we now show that zt t z we have u r b w and e r b e 1 so zth i b 0 1 2 th b 1 20 th i b 0 1 2 th ub 1 20 h on the other hand using 3 9 we have t zh v i b 0 1 2 h e 0 b 1 20 h ub 1 2 0 h but v h c and from the definitions of e 0 and c we get i b 0 1 2 th vv i b 0 1 2 th i vv i b 0 1 2 th vc i b 0 1 2 th e 0 b 1 20 h v i b 0 1 2 h e 0 b 1 20 h hence zt t z which means that t is unitarily equivalent to the operator t t r z and t is an extension of t of the form 3 9 identifying t with t it follows that t has the property iii and we con clude that i implies iii in addition we note that b 1 2 we have seen that such an operator b can be induced by an operator a satisfying ii with b a so we can choose a 1 2 t 1 2 as t 0 in this case to complete the proof we show that iii implies i indeed let us assume that t on m m 0 m 1 h is an extension of t t having the form 3 9 with v e 0 then h as a subspace of m is invariant for t but t is expansive because t 0 2 e e 0 and we infer that t ph t h 0 thus t is also expansive furthermore as we have seen before in corollary 3 3 t is a pm 1 isometry and 2 pm 1 t now pm 1 h 6 0 because otherwise one has h m 0 so t t h v h hence h is invariant for v and t is an isometry in contradiction with our assumption from the beginning of the proof therefore pm 1 h 6 0 which implies phpm 1 h 2 ph t h 2 t thus phpm 1 h 6 0 as t 6 0 finally from the relation t pm 1 t pm 1 we deduce that t a 1 t a 1 where a 1 phpm 1 h hence t is a 2 a 1 isometry with 2 a 1 t therefore t satisfies by theorem 3 2 the requirements of i this proves that iii implies i the proof is complete let us note that in the proof of implication i iii we have used an ar gument inspired from 3 theorem 5 80 which concerns 2 isometries in the case when t is a 2 isometry one can choose in the above proof b t this leads to the isometry e 1 and one can consider e an isometric extension of e 1 with operators with two isometric dilations 119 r e n v then in this case t is a brownian unitary extension of t with cov t cov t and so one recovers the result of 3 concerning the operator t in 3 9 we remark that we do not assume any relationship between the operators e and u however the operator t satisfy the equivalent conditions of theorem 3 7 and they can be described by the special brownian isometric liftings from corollary 3 3 as follows proposition 3 8 for t on h the following statements are equivalent i t has a block matrix decomposition 3 9 on h h 0 h 1 with h 0 an in variant subspace for t t ii t is an expansive p isometry for an orthogonal projection p with 2 p t and some scalar 0 iii t has a minimal brownian isometric lifting s of type i on a space k h h such that n s h is an invariant subspace for s 2 s is an orthogonal projection and cov s proof suppose that t acting on h h 0 h 1 has the form 3 9 with the block matrix given by the operators v e and u with v e 0 and 0 obvi ously the condition v e 0 in 3 9 means that h 0 reduces t t proceeding as in the proof of theorem 3 2 the construction of s since v t h 0 is an isometry in 3 9 we find a lifting s of t on k 2 d e h 0 h 1 with the representations s s 0 d e 0 v e 0 0 u v e 0 u s 0 t where s is the forward shift on h k h v s v on h h 0 e d e e tr h 1 h h 0 while d e jede with je the canonical injection of de into h since v and e are isometries and v e 0 it follows that s is a brownian isometric lifting of type i for t with n s h h 0 and n s h h 0 an invariant subspace for s remark also that 2 s ph 1 so cov s and in addition that s is a minimal lifting of t hence i implies iii conversely let us assume that such an operator s on k h h is a brownian isometric lifting for t with h n s so s is of type i and that n s h is an invariant subspace for s then the operators v 0 s h and v 1 s n s h are isometries hence the isometry v s n s can be written as the direct sum v v 0 v 1 on h n s h as both subspaces are invariant for v then from the block matrix of s on k n s r s with the operators v e u as above and cov s it follows that t has on h n s h r s h 0 h 1 the representation t phs h v 1 f 0 u f ph 0 e h 1 120 c badea and l suciu clearly cov s 0 because t like s can be assumed non isometric since v e 0 in the block matrix of the 2 isometry s we infer v 1 f 0 hence t has a representation of the form 3 9 on h h 0 h 1 where the subspace h 0 reduces t t therefore iii implies i now since the operators of the form 3 9 are expansive and they satisfy 3 4 with the condition 3 5 the implication i ii follows from corollary 3 3 conversely if t satisfies the assertion ii then t has the form 3 4 on h h 0 h 1 with the condition 3 5 by corollary 3 3 the operator t being expansive by ii it follows that c t h 0 is expansive hence c is an isometry c being a contraction by 3 5 then the condition 3 5 reduces to c e 0 where e ph 0 t h 1 we conclude that t has the form 3 9 hence ii implies i remark 3 9 the brownian isometric liftings mentioned in corollary 3 3 and proposition 3 8 are not brownian unitaries because n v 6 r e in the previous proof in general while both satisfy the conditions i ii and iii of 3 theorem 5 20 they not satisfy the condition iv of the same result 3 theorem 5 20 in which brownian unitaries are characterized 3 d concave operators and operators similar to isometries in the case of concave operators we can say more theorem 3 10 for an operator t b h the following statements hold i t is concave if and only if t has an extension t 1 on m m 0 m 1 h of the form 3 10 t 1 v e 1 0 w where v w are isometries e 1 is a contraction with v e 1 0 w e 1 e 1 w e 1 e 1 and t 1 2 in this case t 1 is also concave with t 1 1 2 ii if t is concave and one of the sequences 1 2 t tn or 1 2 t 1 tn 1 converges strongly to zero then the other also strongly converges to zero in this case the sequences 1 n tn and 1 n tn 1 converge strongly to zero iii a concave operator t has a minimal 2 isometric lifting of type i and of covari ance t 1 2 proof assume t concave by applying theorem 3 7 with a t and using the same notation from its proof one obtains an extension t 1 of t on the space m k 0 r b of the form 3 10 more precisely v w are isometries on k 0 respectively on r b e 1 is a contraction from r b into k 0 with v e 1 0 and t 1 2 b 1 2 as t is concave t 1 will be concave too indeed the representation 3 10 of t 1 implies t 1 0 2 e 1 e 1 t 1 t 1 t 1 0 2 w e 1 e 1 w operators with two isometric dilations 121 and from the proof of theorem 3 7 we have for h h e 1 wb 1 2 h 2 e 1 b 1 2 th 2 t tth h th h e 1 b 1 2 h 2 therefore w e 1 e 1 w e 1 e 1 or equivalently t 1 t 1 t 1 t 1 thus t 1 is concave it is clear that t 1 1 2 it follows from the proof of theorem 3 2 that one can consider z an isometry from h into m such that zt t 1 z this implies t z t 1 z so t 1 2 t 1 1 2 hence t 1 1 2 the direct implication of the assertion i is proved while the converse part is easy that is if t has an extension t 1 of the form 3 10 then t t 1 h is concave because h is invariant for t 1 to show the assertion ii we remark that if 1 2 t 1 t n 1 k 0 k 1 e 1 wnk 1 0 n for all k 0 k 0 k 1 r b then for k 1 b 1 2 h with h h we have 1 2 t tnh e 1 wnb 1 2 h 0 n conversely if this last convergence holds then by the banach steinhaus theorem e 1 and w being contractions one has e 1 w nk 1 0 for any k 1 r b in other words 1 2 t 1 t n 1 0 strongly so if one of the sequences 1 2 t t n or 1 2 t 1 t n 1 converges strongly to zero then the other also strongly converges to zero if this happens then by a similar argument to that used in the proof of 20 theorem 3 10 one can show that 1 n tn 0 and 1 n tn 1 0 strongly so ii holds the assertion iii follows immediately thus considering t a b isometry by theorem 3 7 with b t and b t one can construct the 2 isometry sb t as in 3 8 this operator is a minimal lifting of t of type i and of covariance t 1 2 remark 3 11 if t is a concave operator then by theorem 3 7 t has an extension t of the form 3 9 which in fact can be obtained from t 1 in 3 10 by extending w to a unitary operator notice that t is not concave in general so theorem 3 10 shows that the appropriate extensions describing concave opera tors are those of the form 3 10 this provides a model for the concave operators t with t 2 for some fixed 0 a related fact is given by the last as sertion of i in theorem 3 10 which says that a concave t is of class c 0 as a t contraction if and only if the corresponding concave model t 1 is of the same class c 0 as a t 1 contraction we refer to 39 for details about the class c 0 let us remark that t 1 in 3 10 is different from the brownian extension tb of a concave t obtained in 26 theorem b when t 2 i e t i indeed in this case tb is an orthogonal projection contrary to t 1 in general 122 c badea and l suciu note also that the extension t 1 from 3 10 of a concave operator t is an improved version of the extensions obtained in 11 proposition 2 2 theorem 2 1 where different 2 isometric liftings have been directly constructed theorem 3 2 applies in particular to operators similar to isometries these are a isometries with a invertible if t is such an operator satisfying t at a with a i for a scalar 0 then a t t t and t is also an a isometry where a 1 a in addition since a t t t t i one has r a t h hence the corresponding lifting sa t acts on 2 h another interesting case is that of quasi isometries i e the t t isometries where a t t is not necessary invertible in this case corollary 3 12 if t b h is similar to an isometry or t is a quasi isometry then t has a minimal 2 isometric lifting of type i on the space 2 h such a lifting is the operator sa t respectively st t t having covariance a 1 2 respec tively t notice that a quasi isometry t is similar to an isometry if and only if t is injective with r t closed see 25 also a quasi isometry t is expansive if and only if v t r t is an isometry x pr t t n t is expansive and v x 0 hence theorem 3 7 cannot be applied to quasi isometries in general a result obtained in 10 theorem 1 1 shows that an expansive operator is similar to an isometry if and only if the ces ro means mn 1 n 1 n j 0 t jt j are bounded in this case the sequence mn strongly converges to an operator m such that t mt m and m t t thus the expansive operators t which are similar to isometries have 2 isometric liftings of type i these liftings can be chosen of covariance equal to m 1 2 by corollary 3 12 4 two isometric liftings of type ii 4 a a contractions as in definition 3 1 a 2 isometric lifting s for t b h is of type ii if h is invariant for s s the following result should be compared to theorem 3 2 for the type i case theorem 4 1 for t b h the following statements are equivalent i t has a 2 isometric lifting of type ii on a hilbert space containing h ii t is an a contraction for a positive operator a 6 0 on h with t a iii t has a lifting t on h h which is a b isometry for some b b h with 0 6 b 0 such that t b and bh h iv t has a 2 isometric lifting s of the form 3 1 with operators w and x satisfying the condition 4 1 x w x 2 re x w xt 0 operators with two isometric dilations 123 moreover if these statements are true then the lifting s in i and iv can be chosen either minimal or with s h 2 p where p is an orthogonal projection with shifts on the main diagonal of s h in its canonical representation and with cov s 2 max 1 a 1 2 for a from ii proof if s on k h is a 2 isometric lifting of type ii of t with the block ma trix 3 1 then w x 0 and so the condition 4 1 is satisfied hence i implies iv next if a 2 isometric lifting s of the form 3 1 satisfies 4 1 then from the relation 3 7 we infer that t at a where a x x t t clearly one has a 0 since s 0 in 3 2 notice that if a 0 then i t t x x 0 therefore t is a contraction i e an i contraction with i t hence one can always consider a 6 0 and thus we proved that iv implies ii now let t be non isometric and let a be as in ii i e satisfying t at a with a 0 and a t 6 0 then there exists a contraction t on r a such that t a 1 2 a 1 2 t let s be the forward shift on 2 dt and set d jdt where j is the canonical injection of d t into 2 dt define the lifting t of t and the extension a of a on the space h 2 dt h by the block matrices 4 2 t s da 1 2 0 t a i 0 0 a we have s da 1 2 0 we use this relation to obtain that t a t i a 1 2 d 2 t a 1 2 t at i a a 1 2 t t a 1 2 t at i a a therefore t is an a isometry moreover taking into account that t a one has t 0 a t at t 0 a t 2 a setting b 2 a we obtain that b and t satisfy the conditions from iii there fore ii implies iii we also notice that the lifting t of t is minimal that is h n 0 t n h this fact follows easily as for sa t in the proof of theorem 3 2 keeping in mind that d t d t a 1 2 h t being defined on r a in order to prove that iii implies i we assume that t on h h and b are as in iii then using theorem 3 2 we find a 2 isometric lifting s sb t as in 3 8 for t on a hilbert space k h such that s 0 b on k h h clearly s will be a lifting for t having on k h h a representation of the form 3 1 with w s h and x b h h so one obtains s on k h h with representation 3 2 now since bh h and b 0 it follows that h reduces b so b b 0 b 1 on h h h then as s h is an isometry we get the representations s 0 b 0 b 0 b 1 124 c badea and l suciu on the decompositions k h h h h respectively from the block matrix 3 2 of s we infer that w x 0 this means that s is a 2 isometric lifting of type ii for t thus we have shown that iii implies i and all equivalences i iv are provided let us remark that the above lifting s sb t can be chosen in such a man ner that it has the form 3 1 with w 2 p where p is an orthogonal projection indeed if we take b 2 a with a i a and a from ii as in the implication ii iii then s can be expressed in terms of the operator a keeping in mind the form of t we get bt b t 2 a t 2 i a t at t 2 i b 0 on h 2 dt h where b 0 a t at t 0 so by 3 8 the operator s acts on k h h where h 2 r bt and r bt 2 dt r b 0 therefore s has on k h 2 dt h k h h the representations 4 3 s s 2 i b 0 0 s da 1 2 0 0 t w x 0 t where s is a shift operator on h while i and j with b 0 j b 1 20 are the canonical injections of h h respectively of r b 0 into n s we infer from these matrices that w s h has a special form on h k h with two shifts on the main diagonal and i an isometry therefore w 0 2 i 2 pr w also since s 0 b 0 2 i a we get cov s 2 max 1 a 1 2 thus we have proved a part of the last assertion of the theorem it remains to show that the lifting s in i can be also chosen minimal i e with k n 0 snh indeed let us denote by k 0 n 0 s nh the smallest invariant subspace in k for s which contains h and let s 0 s k 0 then s 0 is a 2 isometry since s is an extension of t and a lifting of s 0 we have s 0 h pk 0 s h t hence s 0 is a lifting of t so s 0 has the form s 0 w 0 x 0 0 t on k 0 h 0 h where w 0 s 0 h 0 s h 0 w h 0 and x 0 ph 0 x h here w and x are coming from the block matrix 3 1 of s on k h h and they have representations of the form w w 0 0 x x 0 on h h 0 h 0 respectively from h into h 0 h 0 for the matrix of x but s is a lifting of type ii for t so s sh h then s 0 s 0 h pk 0 s sh h so operators with two isometric dilations 125 s 0 is also a lifting of type ii for t in addition s 0 is a minimal lifting since any lifting of t satisfying i also satisfies iv it follows that in iv one can also chose a minimal lifting for t this completes the proof of theorem remark 4 2 the condition bh h in the assertion iii of theorem 4 1 is essential as we have seen in the proof of iii i if t has a lifting which has a 2 isometric lifting of type i then it is not necessarily true that t has a 2 isometric lifting of type ii obviously theorem 4 1 generalizes theorem 3 2 the assertion ii of the latter can be reformulated in terms of a contractions and q expansive operators t i e operators satisfying 0 q t qt more precisely from theorem 3 2 and 13 theorem 2 1 we deduce the following result which shows when an operator with 2 isometric liftings of type ii has a lifting of type i this always happens for expansive operators by theorems 3 7 and 4 1 in addition the corollary below reproves the assertion ii of theorem 3 7 in the case when q is a scalar multiple of the identity for t expansive corollary 4 3 an operator t 6 0 has a 2 isometric lifting of type i if and only if there exist two positive operators a and q satisfying t a and t at a q t qt notice that if t is an operator similar to a contraction then t is an a 0 contraction for an invertible operator a 0 which can be chosen such that a 0 t t as a direct consequence of theorem 4 1 we obtain the following result corollary 4 4 if t b h is non contractive and similar to a contraction then t has a 2 isometric lifting of type ii and of covariance 2 a 0 1 2 with a 0 t among the operators similar to contractions we can consider those having dilations for 0 an operator t b h is said to have a dilation if there exists a unitary operator u on some space h h such that tn phun h for n 1 see 39 such a dilation u of t is not a lifting for t from corollary 4 4 we deduce the following corollary 4 5 any operator t having a dilation has a minimal 2 isometric lifting of type ii recall see 38 that an operator with a dilation is a st isometry for some positive operator st so if st t it follows that t has even a 2 isometric lifting of type i another special class of operators similar to contractions is given by quasi contractions that is the t t contractions see 11 14 for such an operator t one obtains from theorem 4 1 a 2 isometric lifting s of type ii with cov s 2 max 1 t 2 t 126 c badea and l suciu whenever t is non contractive now we show that there exist operators similar to contractions even quasi contractions which do not have 2 isometric liftings of type i example 4 6 let c be a contraction on h such that cn 0 strongly and let 1 be a scalar then the operator t on h h with the matrix representation t c j 0 0 where j 0 h h 0 for h h is a non contractive quasi contraction thus t is similar to a contraction but tn 0 strongly because c has this property hence t cannot be an a isometry with a 6 0 thus by theorem 3 2 t does not possess 2 isometric liftings of type i a simpler example of this form is a nilpotent operator of order 2 and thus having dilations for suitable on c c on the other hand we show that an operator t similar to a contraction can have 2 isometric liftings of type i not only of type ii without being similar to an isometry therefore in this case corollary 4 3 applies to a non invertible operator a so not equal to the operator a 0 from corollary 4 4 otherwise t will be similar to an isometry by 13 theorem 2 1 example 4 7 let u be a unitary operator on h h 0 h 1 hj 6 0 with a block matrix of the form u v 0 v where v and v are isometries let c v 0 on h and set e j 0 v acting from 0 h to h 0 where j is as in example 4 6 finally we define the operator t on h h by t c e 0 u it is clear that c e 0 therefore t has the form 3 4 furthermore if z jph 1 an operator from 0 h into h 0 then it is easy to see that cz zu j 0 v e a known result see 9 and the last relation ensure that t is similar to a con traction more precisely to the diagonal operator c u as c is not an isometry the operator t is not similar to an isometry however t has a minimal brownian isometric lifting of type i by corollary 3 3 4 b isomorphic minimal 2 isometric liftings previous results show the existence of minimal 2 isometric liftings but their uniqueness up to an isomor phism i e a unitary equivalence which fixes h is not guaranteed in this context this is in contrast to the classical case of isometric unitary dilation theory of con tractions see 17 39 however the following fact about minimal 2 isometric liftings of type ii is true operators with two isometric dilations 127 proposition 4 8 let t b h and let s on k h and s on k h be two minimal 2 isometric liftings of t with s sh h and s s h h then s and s are isomorphic if and only if s s h s s h if this is the case then the 2 isometries s k h and s k h are unitarily equivalent proof let t s and s be as above since s is a 2 isometry we have s 2 s 2 2 s s i and for n 2 one obtains the formula s nsn ns s n 1 i a similar relation holds for s since s sh h we infer that s nsnh h for n 1 on the other hand we have phsn h tn phs n h for n 1 using these relations we obtain for any finite system hj n 0 h that n j 0 sjhj 2 k n j l 0 sjhj slhl h 0 2 n l 1 h 0 tlhl l j 1 s l j s jsjhj hl n j 1 t jhj h 0 j l 1 hj s j l s lslhl h 0 2 2 re n j 1 t jhj h 0 l j 1 s jsjhj tl jhl j l 1 t j lhj s lslhl h 0 2 2 re n j 1 t jhj h 0 l j 2 j 1 hj tl jhl j l 2 l 1 t j lhj hl l j 1 j s shj tl jhl j l 1 l t j lhj s shl assume now that s s h s s h then the last expression in the above computation can be also written in terms of t and s so proceeding in a reverse way one obtains n j 0 sjhj k n j 0 s jhj k then by a standard argument it follows that there exists a unitary operator z from k onto k satisfying the relations zs s z and z h i therefore s and s are isomorphic as 2 isometric liftings of t conversely if there is such an operator z which preserves the elements of h and intertwines s with s then s s z s s z we get s s h z s s h s s h because s s h h and z h i z h thus the first assertion of proposition 4 8 is proved furthermore if z is as above then z k h k h and z z k h is unitary so one obtains z s k h zs k h s z k h s k h z therefore the 2 isometries s k h and s k h are unitarily equivalent by z from the last assertion of the previous proposition we derive the following corollary 4 9 suppose that two minimal 2 isometric liftings of type ii of an operator are isomorphic then one of them is of type i if and only if the other is of type i 128 c badea and l suciu remark 4 10 assume that s on k h is a 2 isometric lifting of type i for t b h if s does not satisfy the minimality condition then the minimal lifting s 0 s k 0 on k 0 n 0 s nh is also of type i for t indeed since k 0 and k h are invariant for s it follows that s 0 k 0 h s k 0 h k 0 h and so s 0 k 0 h s k 0 h is an isometry moreover k 0 is a reducing subspace for s indeed since s sh h we have s k 0 h n 2 s snh k 0 n 1 ss nh k 0 the last inclusion holds because k h n s s being of type i and so by 3 1 we have s 0 s h on k k h h hence ssnh stnh h for h h n 1 thus the minimality condition for 2 isometric liftings of type i can be defined with respect to reducing subspaces or equivalently to subspaces as sumed to be only invariant this fact is analogous to the notion of minimal brow nian unitary respectively isometry in the cyclic case extension for a 2 isometry which appears in 4 section 10
