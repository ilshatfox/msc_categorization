operator valued co ordinate function zie is a blaschke potapov factor we also introduce a notion of operator valued rational function and then show that is two sided inner and rational if and only if it can be represented as a finite blaschke potapov product this extends to operator valued functions the well known result proved by v p potapov for matrix valued functions 1 introduction many properties of matrix valued functions may not be transferred to operator valued functions since some properties of finite matrices are destined to fail for infinite matrices for example if a is an n n matrix of h 2 functions and b is an n n diagonal constant inner function i e b diag for an inner function then a and b are left coprime if and only if a and b are right coprime in other words left coprimeness and right coprimeness coincide for a and b cf chl 4 lemma c 14 however this is no longer true for operator valued functions for example if a z s the shift on 2 and b z i where i is the identity operator on 2 then a and b are right coprime but not left coprime cf chl 4 example c 12 in this paper we consider a question on left inner divisors of the operator valued coordinate function zie where e is a hilbert space we consider the well known result proved by v p potapov po that every rational inner n nmatrix valued function can be written as a finite blaschke potapov product we extend this result to the case of operator valued functions let x be a complex banach space and t denote the unit circle in the complex plane c for 1 p let lp t x be the linear space of all equivalence classes of strongly measurable functions f t x for which t f pdm where m is the normalized lebesgue measure on t we define l t x as the linear space of all equivalence classes of strongly measurable functions f t x for which 2010 mathematics subject classification primary 46 e 40 30 h 10 30 j 05 47 b 35 47 b 20 key words inner functions inner divisors blaschke potapov factor operator

the spaces lp t x are complex banach spaces 1 p for f l 1 t x the n th fourier coefficient of f denoted by f n is defined by f n t znf z dm z for each n z where the integral is understood in the sense of the bochner integral for 1 p define hp t x f lp t x f n 0 for n 0 let b d e denote the set of all bounded linear operators between complex hilbert spaces d and e and abbreviate b e e to b e for 1 p let lps t b d e be the set of all sot measurable b d e valued functions on t such that x lp t e for each x d a function lps t b d e is called a strong lp function we can see that every function in lp t b d e is a strong lp function the notion of strong l 2 function was introduced by v peller in pe the formal theory of strong l 2 functions was developed in chl 4 if l 1 s t b d e and x d then x l 1 e the n th fourier coefficient of l 1 s t b d e denoted by n is given by n x x n n z x d we define h p s t b d e lps t b d e n 0 for n 0 let l t b d e be the space of all bounded sot measurable b d e valued func tions on t then we can easily see that l t b d e l s t b d e 1 indeed obviously l t b d e l s t b d e for the reverse inclusion suppose l s t b d e then x 7 x is a closed linear transform from x into l t e so that by the closed graph theorem it is bounded thus for almost all z t z b d e sup x 1 z x e which implies l t b d e this proves 1 we will also writeh t b d e h s t b d e 1 introduction 3 write ie for the identity operator acting on e write mm n for the set of m n complex matrices and abbreviate mn n to mn also we abbreviate imn to in we say that a function h t b d e is an inner function if id a e on t and that is a two sided inner function if ie a e on t and id a e on t for a function h t b d e we say that an inner function h t b d e is a left inner divisor of if a for some a h t b d d and that h t b d e is an right inner divisor of if b for some b h t b e e a function is an inner divisor of if it is both a left and a right inner divisor of as customarily done we say that two inner functions a b h t b e are equal if they are equal up to a unitary constant right factor i e there exists a unitary constant operator v b e such that a bv note that if v is a unitary operator in b e then for every h t b e v v v v which implies that v is an inner divisor of for a function h t b e we say that a function h t b e is a nontrivial left resp right inner divisor of if is a non unitary operator and is a left right resp inner divisor of for d write b z z 1 z which is called a blaschke factor if m is a closed subspace of a hilbert space e then a function of the form b pm ie pm is called a operator valued blaschke potapov factor where pm is the orthogonal projec tion of e onto m a function d is called a operator valued finite blaschke potapov product if d is of the form d v m m 1 bmpm i pm where v is a unitary operator bm is a blaschke factor and pm is an orthogonal projection in e for each m 1 m in particular a scalar valued function d reduces to a finite blaschke product d m m 1 bm where e i it is known cf po that an n n matrix function d is rational and inner if and only if it can be represented as a finite blaschke potapov product on the other hand we may ask a question what is a left inner divisor of zin for this question we may guess that each left inner divisor of zin is a blaschke potapov 1 introduction 4 factor more specifically we wonder if a left inner divisor of z 00 z zi 2 should be of the following form up to a unitary constant right factor also up to unitary equivalence 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 z z 0 0 1 or z 0 0 z for example a 1 2 1 z 1 z is a left inner divisor of z 00 z zi 2 indeed a 1 2 z z 1 1 z 0 0 z in this case if we take a unitary operator v 1 2 1 1 1 1 then 1 0 0 z v 1 2 1 z 1 z v 1 2 1 z 1 z v v in fact it was shown in chl 1 lemma 2 5 that every left inner divisor of zin h t mn is a blaschke potapov factor 2 this fact is useful for the study of coprime ness of functions cf chl 3 in chl 4 p 23 the authors asked question 1 1 is the statement in 2 still true for operator valued functions we will call a function of the form zie the operator valued coordinate function this allows us to rephrase question 1 1 as follows is every left inner divisor of the operator valued coordinate function a blaschke potapov factor in section 2 we give an affir mative answer to this question in section 3 we introduce a notion of operator valued rational function and then show that is two sided inner and rational if and only if it can be represented as a finite blaschke potapov product which extends the well known result for the matrix valued functions due to v p potapov po in section 4 we consider coprime operator valued rational functions lastly in section 5 we take a glance at right coprime ness and subnormality of toeplitz operators aiming at shedding new light on the differences between matrix valued functions and operator valued functions to proceed we give an elementary observation if dime and h t b e is a two sided inner function then any left inner divisor of is two sided inner cf chl 3 lemma 4 10 we can say more lemma 1 2 cf chl 4 lemma 2 2 let h t b e be a two sided inner function if h t b e is a left inner divisor of then is two sided inner proof if is a left inner divisor of we may write for some h t b e thus is surjective and hence unitary a e on t thus is two sided inner 1 introduction 5 in particular if ie for a scalar inner function then every left inner divisor of is an inner divisor of however in general a left inner divisor of a two sided inner function need not be its right inner divisor to see this we first observe lemma 1 3 let h t b e be a two sided inner function and h t b e be a left inner divisor of then is an inner divisor of if and only if h t b e proof let h t b e be a two sided inner function and h t b e be a left inner divisor of then by lemma 1 2 is two sided inner and we may write h t b e suppose that is an inner divisor of then we can also write for some h t b e thus we have that h t b e the converse is obvious we then have example 1 4 let en n z be the canonical orthonormal basis for l 2 t define and in h t b l 2 t by z en en 1 z if n 0 en 1 if n 0 and z en e n 1 z 2 if n 1 e n 1 if n 1 then and are two sided inner observe that z en en 1 z 1 if n 1 en 1 if n 1 and hence z z en e nz if n 1 e 1 z 2 if n 1 e n if n 1 thus is a left inner divisor of since z z e 3 e 1 z 1 it follows from lemma 1 3 that is not a right inner divisor of on the other hand lemma 1 2 may fail if left is replaced by right example 1 5 let s be the shift operator on h 2 t defined by sf z zf z f h 2 t z t and let z s h t b h 2 t then z z s s i which implies that is a right inner divisor of a two sided inner function i but is not two sided inner by lemma 1 2 is not a left inner divisor of i 2 inner divisors of coordinate functions 6 2 inner divisors of the operator valued coordinate func tions for a complex banach space x and an open subset g of c a function a g x is called holomorphic if in any sufficiently small disc d r r g a is the sum of convergent power series a n 0 a n n a n x denote by hol g x the space of all holomorphic functions a g x let us associate to any function f on d a family of function fr on t defined by fr z f rz 0 r 1 for 1 p let hp d x be the set of all functions f hol d x satisfying f hp d x sup 0 r 1 t fr pdm 1 p we define h d x be the set of all bounded functions f hol d x if l t b d e and rei d let p denote the poisson integral of f defined by p x 1 2 pr t eit x dt x d 0 r 1 3 it is known cf ghkl lemma 2 1 that if h t b d e and h t b d d then p p p 4 we now consider question 1 1 we actually wish to study a more general case and we first observe that if a is an inner divisor of znie then there exists a function h t b e such that a a znie a e on t so that a znie h t b e which implies that a is a polynomial of degree at most n we are ready for theorem 2 1 let a be a polynomial of degree n then the following are equivalent a a is an inner divisor of znie 2 inner divisors of coordinate functions 7 b a n and a n are partial isometries for each n 0 1 n and e n n 0 ran a n n n 0 ran a n c a is a finite blaschke potapov product of the form a z v n m 1 zpm i pm where pm is the orthogonal projection from e onto n n m ran a n and v diag a 0 ran a 0 a 1 ran a 1 a n ran a n proof a b suppose that a is an inner divisor of znie without loss of generality we may assume that a 0 and an are nonzero write a 1 z n n 1 a n zn 1 then a z a 0 za 1 z 5 by lemma 1 2 a is two sided inner thus for almost all z t a 1 z a 0 0 and a 0 a 0 a 1 z a 1 z ie 6 so that a 0 a 0 a 0 a 0 and a 1 z a 1 z a 1 z a 1 z which implies that a 0 and a 1 z are partial isometries for almost all z t cf ha 2 since a is inner it follows from 5 that for almost all z t ker a 0 kera 1 z 0 since h k h k for closed subspaces h k of e it follows that ran a 0 rana 1 z e 7 on the other hand it follows from 5 that ran a 0 cl rana 1 z and by 7 we have that ran a 0 rana 1 z e thus for almost all z t kera 1 z rana 1 z ker a 0 2 inner divisors of coordinate functions 8 similarly we can show that for almost all z t rana 1 z ker a 0 ran a 0 8 since a 1 z is a partial isometry a 1 ker a 0 t b ker a 0 ran a 0 is two sided inner now we will show that ran a 1 ran a 0 9 for x e it follows from 8 that a 1 z x n n 1 a n xzn 1 ran a 0 for almost all z t a n x a 0 y 0 for all y e p a 1 x n n 1 a n x n 1 ran a 0 for all d a 1 x p a 1 0 x ran a 0 which proves 9 put a 2 z n n 2 a n z n 2 then by the same argument we have that i a 1 is a partial isometry ii kera 2 z ker a 1 and rana 2 z ran a 0 ran a 1 iii a 2 ker a 1 t b ker a 1 ran a 1 is two sided inner iv ran a 2 ran a 0 ran a 1 continuing this process we have that a n is a partial isometry for each n 0 1 n and ran a n n 1 n 0 ran a n but since a z is unitary for almost all z t we have that n n 0 ran a n e similarly we also have that a n is a partial isometry for each n 0 1 n and e n n 0 ran a n 2 inner divisors of coordinate functions 9 b c suppose a n and a n are partial isometries for each n 0 1 n and e n n 0 ran a n n n 0 ran a n write en ran a n and fn ran a n then we can write a z a

unitary c a obvious this completes the proof the following corollary gives an affirmative answer to question 1 1 corollary 2 2 if h t b e is a left inner divisor of zie then is a blaschke potapov factor proof immediate from theorem 2 1 we recall lemma 2 3 ni 2 theorem 3 11 10 let a h d b d e then the nontangential sot limit lim r 1 a rz ba z exists for almost all z t such that ba h t b d e and a x p ba x for x d and d the taylor coefficients of a coincide with the nonnegatively indexed fourier coefficients of ba moreover the mapping b a ba is an isometric bijection from h d b d e onto h t b d e 2 inner divisors of coordinate functions 10 for h t b e and d write b then we can easily check the following cf ghkl a h t b e b if is an inner function with values in b e then so is we then have corollary 2 4 let a h t b e then the following are equivalent a a is an inner divisor of bn ie b a is a polynomial in b of degree at most n of the form a n n 0 anb n where an and a n are partial isometries for each n 0 1 n and e n n 0 ranan n n 0 rana n c a is a finite blaschke potapov product of the form a v n m 1 b pm i pm where pm is the orthogonal projection from e onto n n m rana n and v

pm thus the result follows at once from theorem 2 1 corollary 2 5 let a h t b e if a is a nontrivial inner divisor of bn ie then a n 6 0 for some n 1 2 n proof immediate from corollary 2 4 3 operator valued rational functions 11 3 operator valued rational functions in this section we will introduce the notion of operator valued rational function recall that a matrix valued function is rational if its entries are rational functions but this definition is not appropriate for operator valued functions in particular h functions even though the terminology of entry may be properly interpreted thus the new idea should capture and encapsulate a definition of operator valued rational function which is equivalent to the condition that each entry is rational when the function is matrix valued in the sequel we give a formal definition of operator valued rational function to do so we first recall toeplitz and hankel operators for l t b d e the hankel operator h h 2 t d h 2 t e is defined by h f jp f f h 2 t d where j denotes the unitary operator from l 2 t e to l 2 t e given by jg z zg z for g l 2 t e and p is the orthogonal projection from l 2 t e onto l 2 t e h 2 t e also a toeplitz operator t h 2 t d h 2 t e is defined by t f p f f h 2 t d where p is the orthogonal projection from l 2 t e onto h 2 t e for a b d e valued function write z z and as usual a shift operator se on h 2 t e is defined by sef z zf z for each f h 2 t e the following theorem is a fundamental result in modern operator theory the beurling lax halmos theorem chl 4 ha 2 ff pe a subspace m of h 2 t e is invariant for the shift operator se on h 2 t e if and only if m h 2 t e where e is a subspace of e and is an inner function with values in b e e fur thermore is unique up to a unitary constant right factor i e if m h 2 t e where is an inner function with values in b e e then v where v is a unitary operator from e onto e if l t b d e then by the beurling lax halmos theorem kerh h 2 t e for some inner function with values in b e e we note that e may be the zero space and need not be two sided inner we recall 3 operator valued rational functions 12 definition 3 1 chl 4 a function l 2 s t b d e is said to be of bounded type if kerh h 2 e for some two sided inner function with values in b e it is known that if ij is a matrix valued function of bounded type then each entry ij is of bounded type i e ij is a quotient of two bounded analytic functions in particular it is also known ab chl 1 that if l 2 is of bounded type then can be written as a where is an inner function and a h 2 10 for h t b d 1 e and h t b d 2 e we say that and are left coprime if and has no common nontrivial left inner divisor also we say that and are right coprime if and are left coprime lemma 3 2 chl 4 lemma 2 4 if l t b d e and is a two sided inner function with values in b e then the following are equivalent a is of bounded type i e kerh h 2 t e b a where a h t b e d is such that and a are right coprime we now introduce definition 3 3 a function h t b d e is said to be rational if h 2 t e kerh 11 for some finite blaschke product observe that if h t b d e then is rational is of bounded type 12 to see this suppose is rational by definition and the beurling lax halmos theorem there exist a finite blaschke product and an inner function h t b e e such that h 2 t e kerh h 2 t e which implies that is a left inner divisor of ie thus is two sided inner so that by lemma 3 2 is of bounded type which proves 12 also if ij h t mm n is a rational function in the sense of definition 3 3 then each entry ij is rational to see this suppose a matrix valued function satisfies the condition 11 put a then a h t mn m and a thus ij can be written as ij aij aij h via the kronecker s lemma ni 1 p 183 we can see that ij is rational ij aij with a finite blaschke product 3 operator valued rational functions 13 which says that each ij is rational in particular if zn in 11 becomes an operator valued polynomial in 1955 v p potapov po proved that an n n matrix valued function is rational and inner if and only if it can be represented as a finite blaschke potapov product in this section we extend this result to operator valued functions to so so we first observe lemma 3 4 suppose that is a finite blaschke product of the form m n 1 b n n d and is an inner divisor of ie let and pn be the orthogonal projection of e onto cl ranp n then b npn ie pn is an inner divisor of n b nie for each n 1 2 m proof write a p and c p then it follows from 4 that p ac ca since 0 p n a n c n we have that cl ranc n kera n thus we may write a n a n b npn ie pn 13 where pn is the orthogonal projection of e onto cl ranc n on the other hand we can write a a n an b nie for some an h d b e it thus follows from 13 that a a n b npn ie pn an pn b n ie pn b npn ie pn a n an pn b n ie pn b npn ie pn since a n an pn b n ie pn h d b e it follows from lemma 2 3 that n b a n an pn b n ie pn h t b e and by 4 b a n b npn ie pn 14 now write bn b npn ie pn then bnc n ie pn c n 0 thus we can write bnc b nie f for some f h d b e thus p ac ab n b nie f and hence by 4 and 14 we have n b nie b f 3 operator valued rational functions 14 so that b nie nb f this completes the proof we then have theorem 3 5 let be a finite blaschke product if is an inner divisor of ie then is a finite blaschke potapov product proof suppose is a finite blaschke product of the form m n 1 b n if is an inner divisor of ie then is also inner divisor of let pn be the orthogonal projection of e onto cl ranp n then it follows from lemma 3 4 that 1 b mpm ie pm is an inner divisor of b m ie by the same argument we have that 2 1 b m 1 pm 1 ie pm 1 b mpm ie pm b m 1 pm 1 ie pm 1 is an inner divisor of b m 1 b m ie continuing this process we have that m m 1 n 0 b m npm n ie pm n is an inner divisor of ie thus v m is a unitary operator and hence v m n 1 b npn ie pn is a finite blaschke potapov product this completes the proof corollary 3 6 a function h t b d e is rational if and only if a where is a finite blaschke potapov product and a h t b e d is such that and a are right coprime proof this follows from lemma 3 2 12 and theorem 3 5 we are ready for 4 coprime operator valued rational functions 15 corollary 3 7 a two sided inner function h t b e is rational if and only if it can be represented as a finite blaschke potapov product proof suppose that is rational and two sided inner then it follows from corollary 3 6 that a 15 where is a finite blaschke potapov product and a h t b e since and are two sided inner so is a thus by 15 is a left inner divisor of and hence the result follows from theorem 3 5 the converse is clear this completes the proof 4 coprime operator valued rational functions in this section we consider coprime operator valued rational functions lemma 4 1 let h t b e if p has no dense range for d then p b pm i pm m kerp is a nontrivial left inner divisor of proof write a p that is a is the poisson integral of defined by 3 suppose that the range of a is not dense then m kera cl rana 6 0 put p b pm i pm then p b iea 0 and hence we can write p b iea b iea 1 for some a 1 h d b e which implies that a pa 1 this completes the proof for an inner function let z be the set of all zeros of then we have theorem 4 2 let h t b e and ie with a finite blaschke product then the following statements are equivalent a p has dense range for each z b and are left coprime proof a b suppose that and are not left coprime then by theorem 3 5 there exist 0 z and a nonzero subspace m of e such that b 0 pm i pm where h t b e thus cl ranp 0 m 6 e b a this follows from at once form lemma 4 1 4 coprime operator valued rational functions 16 lemma 4 3 if h t b d e then h t b e d in this case p p proof since n n for all n 0 1 2 it follows that p n 0 n n p corollary 4 4 let h t b e if p is not injective for d then p b pm i pm m kerp is a nontrivial right inner divisor of proof suppose that p is not injective then by lemma 4 3 p p has no dense range let q b pm i pm where m kerp kerp 6 0 then it follow from lemma 4 1 that q is a nontrivial left inner divisor of but since q is two sided inner it follows that p q is a nontrivial right inner divisor of this completes the proof we also have corollary 4 5 let h t b e and ie with a finite blaschke product then the following statements are equivalent a p is injective for each z b and are right coprime proof immediate from theorem 4 2 and lemma 4 3 corollary 4 6 let h t mn and in with a finite blaschke product then the following statements are equivalent a p is invertible for each z b and are right coprime c and are left coprime proof the equivalence a b follows from theorem 4 2 and corollary 4 5 together with matrix theory the equivalence b c comes from chl 2 lemma 3 3 the equivalence b c of corollary 4 6 may fail for operator valued functions for example if we take e 2 z then se and zie are right coprime but not left coprime cf chl 4 5 miscellany 17 5 miscellany in this section we establish some key differences between matrix valued functions and operator valued functions 5 1 a glance at right coprime ness if and are not left coprime then there exists a common nontrivial left inner divisor of both and however we don t guarantee that this is still true for right coprime ness in other words if and are not right coprime then by definition a and b for some nontrivial inner function however we need not expect that is inner we here give a sufficient condition for the existence of a common nontrivial right inner divisor of two functions when they are not right coprime to see this we first recall that a function f h t b e e is called outer if clfh 2 t e h 2 t e we then have an analogue of the scalar factorization theorem called the inner outer factorization the inner outer factorization ni 1 if a h t b d e then we can write a aiae inner outer factorization where e is a subspace of e ai h t b e e is an inner function and ae h t b d e is an outer function the following lemma is a characterization of functions of bounded type lemma 5 1 chl 4 corollary 2 25 let be an inner function with values in b d e then is of bounded type c is two sided inner where c is the complementary factor of i e kerh c h 2 d d for some hilbert space d and c denotes the 1 2 matrix whose entries are and c we then have theorem 5 2 suppose that h t b d e 1 and h t b d e 2 are not right coprime if there exists a nontrivial left inner divisor of left g c d and is of bounded type then c is a common nontrivial right inner divisor of both and proof since h t b d e 1 and h t b d e 2 are not right coprime left g c d h t b d 1 d is not a unitary operator and we can write 1 and 1 16 5 miscellany 18 where 1 h t b e 1 d 1 and 1 h t b e 2 d 1 since is a left inner divisor of we can write 1 1 h t b d 1 d 2 h t b d 2 d 17 since is not a unitary operator and is of bounded type by lemma 5 1 0 c is not a unitary operator and a two sided inner function note that c is an inner function with values in b d 3 d for some hilbert space d 3 thus we can write 1 c 1 0 0 0 where 0 d 4 d 3 it thus follows from 16 and 17 that 1 0 0 and 1 0 0 but since 0 is two sided inner we have that 0 is two sided inner this completes the proof corollary 5 3 let h t b d e 1 h t b d e 2 and left g c d if is of bounded type then c is a common nontrivial right inner divisor of both and proof immediate from theorem 5 2 5 2 subnormality of toeplitz operators in 1970 p r halmos posed the following problem listed as problem 5 in his series of lectures ten problems in hilbert space ha 1 is every subnormal toeplitz operator either normal or analytic halmos problem 5 has been partially answered in the affirmative by many authors however in 1984 halmos problem 5 was answered in the negative by c cowen and j long col despite considerable efforts to date researchers have been unable to characterize subnormal toeplitz operators in terms of their symbols thus we have halmos problem 5 reformulated which toeplitz operators are subnormal for cases of matrix valued symbols the subnormality of toeplitz operators was studied in chl 2 in which it was shown that if the matrix valued symbol satisfies a general condition on coprime factorization and t is subnormal then it is either normal or analytic also in chkl it was conjectured that every subnormal toeplitz operator with matrix valued rational symbol is unitarily equivalent to a direct sum of a normal operator and a toeplitz operator with analytic symbol in fact if an n n matrix valued function is analytic then the normal extension of t is the multiplication operator m so clearly 5 miscellany 19 t is subnormal however this is not the case for the operator valued symbols in this section we will give an example see example 5 5 below on the other hand if is matrix valued and t is subnormal even hyponormal then should be normal i e a e on t cf ghr however this may also fail for operator valued symbols example 5 4 let s tz on h 2 t and z szn h t b h 2 t n 0 then t t ts s ih 2 t h 2 t so that t is quasinormal and hence subnormal however z z ss 6 s s z z for all z t which implies that is not normal here we don t need to expect that the multiplication operator m l 2 t b h 2 t l 2 t b h 2 t is a normal extension of t indeed it is easy to show that m is not normal and hence m can never be a normal extension of t what is a normal extension of t let b mz on l 2 t and z bzn h t b l 2 t then a straightforward calculation shows that the multiplication operator m l 2 t b l 2 t l 2 t b l 2 t is a normal extension of t the following simple example shows that analytic toeplitz operators with operator valued symbols need not be even hyponormal example 5 5 let z s h t b h 2 t and e 0 be the costant function 1 h 2 t if f z e 0 z then t t t t f f e 0 z e 0 z 1 0 which implies that t is not hyponormal and hence not subnormal even though is analytic we would like to pose question 5 6 which analytic toeplitz operators with operator valued symbols are sub normal for a sufficient condition one may be tempted to conjecture that if h t b h 2 t and if z is subnormal for almost all z t then t
