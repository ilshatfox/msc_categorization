operators satisfying the so called quasitriangular property dim ker t dim ker t for every in the taylor spectrum t of t we prove that the weyl spectrum of t t satisfies the identity t t 00 t where 00 t denotes the set of isolated eigenvalues of finite multiplicity our method of proof relies on a strictly 2 variable fact about the topo logical boundary of the taylor spectrum as a result our proof does not hold for d tuples of commuting hyponormal operators with d 2 1 weyl s theorem in two variables the aim of this note is to present an analog of weyl s theorem for commuting pairs of hyponormal operators for the definitions and basic theory of various spectra including the taylor and harte spectra the reader is referred to 9 see also 17 for a commuting d tuple t we reserve the symbols t h t p t and e t for the taylor spectrum harte spectrum point spectrum and taylor essential spectrum of t respectively by a commuting d tuple t we understand here and throughout this note a d tuple of commuting bounded linear operators t 1 td on a complex separable hilbert space h for d 1 l coburn proved in 6 weyl s theorem for hyponormal operators this led to a number of extensions to classes of operators containing the subnormal operators for d 1 there are various notions of weyl spectrum 5 13 16 15 we recall in particular two notions of weyl spectrum with which we will be primarily concerned the joint weyl spectrum t of a commuting d tuple t is defined as t t k k k d h such that t k is commuting where k d h denotes the collection of d tuples of compact operators on h the taylor weyl spectrum of t is defined as w t e t t e t ind t 6 0 where 1 d and the fredholm index ind s of a d tuple s of commuting operators is the euler characteristic of the koszul complex k s h for s

ker qs i by weyl spectrum we understand any of the joint weyl and taylor weyl spectra for future reference we record the following elementary fact from 12 about the relationship between the aforementioned two notions of weyl spectra for the sake of completeness we provide an alternative verification of this result lemma 1 1 12 lemma 2 the joint weyl spectrum and taylor weyl spectrum of a commuting d tuple t satisfies the relation w t t proof suppose that there exists a d tuple k of compact operators such that t k is a commuting d tuple and t k thus t k is invertible and hence fredholm with fredholm index equal to 0 by the multivariable atkinson theorem 7 theorem 2 t is fredholm with index equal to 0 that is w t remark 1 2 it is interesting to note that w t t for all t if and only if d 1 this may be concluded from the discussion following 11 theorem where it is shown that certain fredholm d tuples of index equal to 0 cannot be perturbed by compact tuples to a taylor invertible tuple see also 12 before we present an analog of weyl s theorem 6 theorem 3 1 for commuting hyponormal tuples recall that a bounded linear operator s on a hilbert space h is hyponormal if its self commutator s s ss is positive also given a d tuple s s 1 sd we let qs x d i 1 s i xsi for x a bounded operator on h definition 1 3 cf 12 a d tuple t has the quasitriangular property if t satisfies dimkerqt i dimkerqt i 1 2 for every t where t t we are now ready to state our main result theorem 1 4 let t be a commuting d tuple of hyponormal operators on a hilbert space h and let 00 t denote the set of isolated eigenvalues of t of finite multi plicity the following statements are true i t t 00 t ii assume d 2 and that t satisfies 1 2 then t 00 t w t remark 1 5 condition 1 2 is equivalent to the statement that the dimension of the cohomology group at the first stage of the koszul complex for t is greater than or equal to the dimension of the cohomology group at the last stage of the koszul complex for t this property is closely related to the notion of quasitriangular operator see the discussion following 12 definition 3 finally note that 1 2 is satisfied by any d tuple t such that p t i for some i 1 d the following is immediate from theorem 1 4 and lemma 1 1 weyl s theorem in two variables 3 corollary 1 6 let t be a commuting pair of hyponormal operators on a hilbert space h and let 00 t denotes the set of isolated eigenvalues of t of finite multi plicity if t satisfies the quasitriangular property 1 2 then 1 3 t t 00 t w t proof by theorem 1 4 i t t 00 t and by theorem 1 4 ii t 00 t w t since w t t is always true by lemma 1 1 1 3 follows remark 1 7 i one cannot relax the condition 1 2 indeed let t u 0 where u denotes the unilateral shift on 2 z see the discussion following 12 definition 5 indeed for this commuting pair t d 0 e t t 0 00 t t t and w t e t ii note further that the result above is not best possible indeed it may happen that the conclusion of weyl s theorem holds but 1 2 is violated for instance let t be the drury arveson 2 variable weighted shift then t 1 and t 2 are hyponormal operators such that 00 t and t t w t b 1 however since i qt i 0 and i qt i is the orthogonal projection onto the scalars 0 dim kerqt i dimkerqt i 1 for every t the first part of theorem 1 4 generalizes 5 theorem 4 while corollary 1 6 generalizes 12 theorem 6 when d 2 see also 14 theorem 2 5 4 all these were obtained under the additional assumption that t is doubly commuting that is a commuting d tuple t such that t i tj tjt i for 1 i 6 j d although the conclusion of 12 theorem 6 is stronger than that of theorem 1 4 our result does not assume double commutativity on the other hand our method of proof relies on a consequence of a strictly 2 dimensional result about the topo logical boundary of the taylor spectrum 9 theorem 6 8 and hence does not extend to the case d 3 2 proof of theorem 1 4 the proof of theorem 1 4 presented below relies on a number of non trivial results including the shilov idempotent theorem 9 18 we also need a result from 8 pertaining to connections between harte and taylor spectra we begin with a decomposition of tuples of commuting hyponormal operators we believe this result is known although we have not been able to find a concrete reference in the literature in what follows recall that 1 d lemma 2 1 let t be a d tuple of commuting hyponormal operators t 1 td then for any 1 d t m 1 kerqt i is a reducing subspace for t where t denotes the d tuple t i t 1 1 i td di and qt i d i 1 ti ii ti ii moreover t decomposes into 1 im 1 dim 1 b on the orthogonal direct sum h m 1 m 1 where im 1 is the identity operator on m 1 and b is a d tuple of commuting hyponormal operators such that kerqb im 1 0 4 s chavan and r curto proof note that m 1 kerqt i d i 1 ker ti ii clearly ti m 1 m 1 for any i 1 d since ti is hyponormal tix ix implies t i x ix and hence t i m 1 m 1 for any i 1 d since t is an extension of b it follows immediately that b has the desired properties to state the next result we recall that a pair s of commuting operators is said to be semi fredholm if all boundary maps in the koszul complex k s h have closed range and either h 0 s and h 2 s are finite dimensional or h 1 s is finite dimensional lemma 2 2 cf 8 corollary 3 6 and 9 corollary 6 10 let t be a pair of commuting operators and let be an isolated point of h t assume that is in the semi fredholm domain of t then is an isolated point of t if and only if ind t 0 proof of theorem 1 4 i to see the inclusion t t 00 t it suf fices to check that any isolated eigenvalue of t of finite multiplicity does not belong to the taylor spectrum of some finite rank perturbation of t to see that let 1 d be an isolated point of the taylor spectrum of t t 1 td let k 1 and let k 2 t k 1 by the shilov idempo tent theorem 9 application 5 24 there exist invariant subspaces m 1 m 2 of t such that h m 1 m 2 banach direct sum and t mi ki for i 1 2 by the spectral mapping property for the taylor spectrum 9 corollary 3 5 t m 1 im 1 0 where im 1 is the identity operator on m 1 since t m 1 im 1 is a commuting d tuple of hyponormal operators it follows from the projection property for the taylor spectrum 9 theorem 4 9 that ti m 1 iim 1 for i 1 d in particular m 1 d i 1 ker ti iim 1 since k 2 we must have m 1 d i 1 ker ti iim 1 by the preceding lemma t decomposes into i b on the orthogonal direct sum h m 1 m 1 where b is a commuting d tuple of hyponormal operators obtained by restricting t to m 1 suppose now that b since t b 9 page 39 is an isolated point of b since b b 1 bd is a d tuple of hyponormal operators by the argument of the preceding paragraph isolated points of b must be eigenvalues of b and hence there exists 0 6 y m 1 such that y di 1 ker bi iim 1 it follows that y di 1 ker ti iih m 1 which is a contradiction thus b we have proved that if is an isolated eigenvalue of t having finite multiplicity then b t im 1 is a finite rank perturbation of t and b as desired ii assume now that d 2 and that t has the quasitriangular property 1 2 since each ti is hyponormal dimkerqt i dim kerqt i for every t 2 1 let t be such that t is fredholm with fredholm index equal to 0 by the definition of the fredholm index see 1 1 and 2 1 2 dimkerqt i dimh 1 t 2 dimkerqt i 2 2 where h 1 s is the middle cohomology group appearing in the koszul complex of the commuting pair s since t e t by 2 2 we must necessarily have 0 dimkerqt i and hence is an eigenvalue of t of finite multiplicity weyl s theorem in two variables 5 to see that is an isolated point of t in view of lemma 2 2 it suffices to check that is an isolated point of the harte spectrum h t of t if b is as in lemma 2 1 then b im 1 is also fredholm with index equal to 0 since kerqb im 1 0 by lemma 2 1 using 2 1 we must have kerqb im 1 0 on the other hand qb im 1 and qb im 1 are fredholm by item v in the paragraph immediately following 9 remark 6 7 as a result qb im 1 and qb im 1 are invertible it follows that cannot be in the harte spectrum h b since h t h b must be an isolated point of h t as desired remark 2 3 assume that the commuting pair t satisfies 1 2 if t has no normal direct summand then by lemma 2 1 t has no eigenvalues and hence the weyl spectrum of t coincides with the taylor spectrum 3 some consequences of theorem 1 4 in this section we discuss a couple of interesting consequences of theorem 1 4 cf 6 corollary 3 2 first we recall the notion of jointly hyponormality for d tuples a d tuple t t 1 td of bounded linear operators on h is said to be jointly hyponormal if the d d matrix t j ti 1 i j d is positive definite where a b stands for the commutator ab ba of a and b corollary 3 1 let t t 1 t 2 be a jointly hyponormal commuting pair with the quasitriangular property 1 2 if t has no isolated eigenvalues of finite multiplicity then for any pair k k 1 k 2 of compact operators k 1 k 2 such that t k is commuting we have t 1 t 1 t 2 t 2 t 1 k 1 t 1 k 1 t 2 k 2 t 2 k 2 proof since t has no isolated eigenvalues of finite multiplicity theorem 1 4 implies that t t k for any pair k of compact operators such that t k is commuting now apply 4 lemma 3 10 and 3 lemma 2 1 to conclude that t 1 t 1 t 2 t 2 r t 2 r t k 2 t 1 k 1 t 1 k 1 t 2 k 2 t 2 k 2 where r s sup z 1 2 zd 2 z 1 zd s denotes the geometric spectral radius of the d tuple s of bounded linear operators on h we do not know whether the conclusion of the last corollary holds for commuting pairs of hyponormal operators satisfying the quasitriangular property recall that there exist commuting pairs of subnormal operators which are not jointly hyponormal the drury arveson 2 variable weighted shift is such an example next we obtain an analog of the riesz schauder theorem for commuting pairs of hyponormal operators cf 14 corollary 2 5 6 recall that a commuting d tuple is browder invertible if t is fredholm such that there exists a deleted neighborhood of 0 disjoint from the taylor spectrum of t the browder spectrum b t of t 6 s chavan and r curto is the collection of those cd for which t is not browder invertible it is not hard to see that b t is the union of e t and the accumulation points of the taylor spectrum t cf 10 for basic facts about the browder spectrum in the case d 1 the reader is referred to 2 corollary 3 2 let t t 1 t 2 be a jointly hyponormal 2 tuple with the quasitri angular property 1 2 then b t t proof the inclusion t b t is always true 14 lemma 2 5 3 to see the reverse inclusion let t by lemma 1 1 w t in particular e t by theorem 1 4 ii if w t then is an isolated point of t since b t is the union of e t and the accumulation points of t it follows that b t the desired inclusion is now clear references 1 w arveson subalgebras of c
