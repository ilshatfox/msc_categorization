5726 v 2 1 introduction given a collection of complex numbers 2 n 00 01 10 0 2 n 1 2 n 1 2 n 1 1 2 n 0 with 00 0 and ji ij the truncated complex moment problem tcmp consists of finding a positive borel measure sup ported in the complex plane c such that ij z izj d 0 i j 2 n is called a truncated moment sequence of order 2 n and is called a representing measure for if in addition we require supp k closed c we speak of the k tcmp naturally associated with each tcmp is a moment matrix m n m n whose concrete construction will be given in subsection 1 1 m n detects the positivity of the riesz functional p 7 ij aij ij p z z ij aij z izj on the cone generated by the collection pp p c z z in ad dition to its importance for applications a complete solution of tcmp would readily lead to a solution of the full moment problem via a weak convergence argument as shown by j stochel 39 while we primarily focus on truncated moment problems the full moment problem in one or several variables has been widely studied see for example 1 2 15 21 22 23 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 33 34 35 36 37 40 41 42 building on previous work for the case of real moments several years ago the first named author and l fialkow introduced in 5 6 and 7 an approach to tcmp based on matrix positivity and extension combined with a new func tional calculus for the columns of m n labeled 1 z z z 2 z z z 2 this allowed them to show that tcmp is soluble in the following cases i tcmp is of flat data type 5 i e rank m n rank m n 1 this case subsumes all previous results for the hamburger stieltjes hausdorff and toeplitz truncated moment problems 4 ii the column z is a linear combination of the columns 1 and z 6 theorem 2 1 iii for some k n 2 1 the analytic column zk is a linear combination of columns corresponding to monomials of lower degree 6 theorem 3 1 iv the analytic columns of m n are linearly dependent and span cm n the column space of m n 5 corollary 5 15 v m n is singular and subordinate to conics 9 10 11 12 vi m n admits a rank preserving moment matrix extension m n 1 i e an extension m n 1 which is flat 13 vii m n is extremal i e rank m n card v 2 n where v v 2 n is the algebraic variety of see subsection 1 2 below 14 the common feature of the above mentioned cases is the presence at the level of cm n of algebraic conditions implied by the existence of a representing measure with support in a proper real algebraic subset of the plane however the chief attraction of the truncated moment problem tmp is its naturalness since the data set is finite we can apply finite techniques grounded in finite dimensional operator theory linear algebra and algebraic geometry to develop algorithms for explicitly computing finitely atomic representing measures 2 1 1 the truncated complex moment problem given a collection of complex numbers 2 n 00 01 10 0 2 n 1 2 n 1 2 n 1 1 2 n 0 with 00 0 and ji ij the associated moment matrix m n m n is built as follows m n m 0 0 m 0 1 m 0 n m 1 0 m 1 1 m 1 n m n 0 m n 1 m n n where m i j i j i 1 j 1 i j 0 i 1 j 1 i j i j 1 1 0 i j 1 i j 1 j i observe that each rectangular block m i j is toeplitz that is constant along diagonals and that m n 1 m n b b c for some matrices b and c moreover the results in 5 and 7 imply that each soluble tmp with finite algebraic variety is eventually extremal see also 16 it is well known that the positivity of the moment matrixm n is a necessary condition for the existence of a representing measure 5 thus we always assume m n 0 to check the positivity of a prospective moment matrix m n 1 given the positivity of m n we need the following classical result theorem 1 1 smul jan s theorem 38 let a b c be matrices of complex numbers with a and c square matrices then a b b c 0 a 0 b aw for some w c w aw moreover rank a b b c rank a c w aw remark 1 2 when the rank equality occurs in theorem 1 1 we say that a b b c a aw w a w aw is a flat extension of a note that while flat extensions are in principle easy to build given a moment matrix a m n the block w aw w m n w may or may not satisfy the structural prop erty of being toeplitz this is precisely the difficulty posed in generating flat extensions of positive moment matrices 1 2 extremal moment problems given a polynomial p z z ij aij z izj we let p z z ij aij z izj so that p z z cm n and we let z p denote the zero set of p the assignment 3 p 7 p z z is what we call the functional calculus we define the algebraic variety of by v v p z z 0 deg p nz p 1 1 observe that p z z m n p where p denotes the vector of coefficients of p so that p z z 0 if and only if p kerm n if admits a representing measure then the rank r of the moment matrix m n is always bounded above by the cardinality v of v one actually has supp v and r card supp v 7 further in this case if p is any polynomial of degree at most 2 n such that p v 0 then the riesz functional satisfies p p d 0 in summary the following three conditions are clearly necessary for the existence of a representing measure for 2 n positivity m n 0 1 2 consistency p p 2 n p v 0 p 0 1 3 variety condition r v i e rank m n card v 1 4 the main result in 14 shows that these three conditions are indeed sufficient in the extremal case r v it was also proved in 14 that consistency cannot be replaced by the weaker condition that m n is recursively generated even if the algebraic variety is a planar cubic m n is recursively generated if for any column relation in m n of the form p z z 0 one automatically has pq z z 0 for each polynomial q with deg pq n each singular moment matrixm n has at least one nontrivial linear relation in its column space and each such relation is naturally associated with the zero set of a multivariable polynomial p consider now the ideal i generated by all the above mentioned polynomials h m moe ller 24 and c scheiderer proved independently that i is a real radical ideal whenever m n 0 cf 23 subsection 5 1 p 203 and 22 we also know that if v is finite then i is zero dimensional so results from algebraic geometry apply we now recall a result that will allow us to convert a given moment problem into a simpler equivalent moment problem for a b c c b 6 c let z a bz cz z c given 2 n define 2 n by ij i j 0 i j 2 n where denotes the riesz functional associated with it is straightforward to verify that if z z z z then l p p for every p pn note that for p z z aij z izj p z z p z z aij z i z j proposition 1 3 invariance under degree one transformations 10 proposi tion 1 7 let m n and m n be the moment matrices associated with and and let jp p p pn then the following statements hold i m n j m n j ii j is invertible iii m n 0 m n 0 4 iv rank m n rankm n v the formula establishes a one to one correspondence between the sets of representing measures for and which preserves measure class and cardinality of the support moreover supp supp vi m n admits a flat extension if and only if m n admits a flat extension vii for p pn p z z j p z z 1 3 statement of the main result in this paper we initiate the study cubic column relations associated with finite algebraic varieties that is the case when m 3 0 m 2 0 with cardv m 3 cubic column relations with infinite variety have already appeared in 17 we begin by stating the general solution of the singular quartic moment problem theorem 1 4 cf 6 8 11 12 18 let p c z z with deg p 2 then 2 n has a representing measure supported in the curve p z z 0 if and only if m n has a column dependence relation p z z 0 m n 0 m n is recursively generated and r v in view of theorem 1 4 we can always assume that m 2 is invertible since m 3 is a square matrix of size 10 and since we focus on the case of finite algebraic variety the possible values for rank m 3 are 7 and 8 while rank m 3 9 is theoretically possible the associated algebraic variety which must have at least 9 points to conform with the inequality r v would be infinite being determined by a single column dependence relation when r v 7 we focus on the case of a column relation given by an harmonic polynomial q z z f z g z where f and g are analytic polynomials and deg q 3 using degree one transformations and symmetric properties of such polynomials we reduce tmp to the case z 3 itz uz with t u r wilmhurst 43 crofoot sarason 32 and khavinson swiatek 20 proved that for deg f 3 we have card z f z z 7 it immediately follows that a tmp with such a cubic column relation can have at most 7 points in its algebraic variety we present below our main result theorem 1 5 first we need some notation for u t r let q 7 z z z 3 itz uz 1 5 and qlc z z i z iz z z u 1 6 for u t r and q 7 defined as in 1 5 assume that u t is in the open cone 0 u t 2 u then card z q 7 7 as can be verified using mathematica 44 cf lemma 2 3 in fact this 7 point set consists of the origin two points equidistant from the origin located on the bisector z iz and four points on a circle symmetrically located with respect to the bisector 5 cf figure 1 and lemma 2 3 moreover there is a cubic polynomial whose zero set consists precisely of the union of the bisector and the circle given by qlc z z i z iz z z u the fact that z q 7 z qlc is crucial re q 7 im q 7 re q 7 im q 7 re q 7 im q 7 figure 1 the 7 point set z q 7 the circle has radius u theorem 1 5 let m 3 0 with m 2 0 and q 7 z z 0 for u t r and q 7 qlc defined as in 1 5 and 1 6 assume that 0 u t 2 u the following statements are equivalent i there exists a representing measure for m 3 ii qlc 0 zqlc 0 iii re 12 im 12 u re 01 im 01 22 t u 11 2 u im 02 iv qlc z z z 2 z iz z 2 uz iuz 0 since we are dealing with an extremal moment problem in order to prove theorem 1 5 we need to verify consistency see 1 3 which we do with the help of lemma 3 2 acknowledgments the authors are indebted to professors lawrence fialkow and frank sottile for several discussions related to the topics in this paper the authors are also deeply grateful to the referee for many suggestions that led to significant improvements in the presentation most of the examples and some of the proofs in this paper were obtained with the aid of the software tool mathematica 44 6 2 cubic column relations since we know how to solve the singular quartic moment problem 10 with out loss of generality we will hereafter assume m 2 0 we first recall a result from 6 theorem 2 1 6 theorem 3 1 if m n admits a column relation of the form zk pk 1 z z 1 k n 2 1 and deg pk 1 k 1 then m n admits a flat extension m n 1 and therefore a representing measure now if k 3 theorem 2 1 can be used only if n 4 thus one strategy is to somehow extend m 3 to m 4 and preserve the column relation z 3 p 2 z z this requires first checking that the b block can be written asm 3 w for some w and then verifying that the c block in the extension satisfies the toeplitz condition something highly nontrivial a concrete attempt using mathematica 44 led to memory overflow on the other hand since we always assume that m 2 is positive and invert ible and since the flat extension case rank m 3 rank m 2 is well known the first nontrivial case of m 3 with finite variety arises when rank m 3 7 now since a soluble tmp requires r v the algebraic variety of a soluble tmp needs to have a minimum of 7 points in other words when r 7 we either have v 7 or no representing measure now given a cubic polynomial p z z 3 bz 2 cz d the substitution w z b 3 which produces an equivalent tmp by proposition 1 3 transforms it into q w w 3 c w d thus without loss of generality we always assume that there is no quadratic term in the analytic piece based on the previous considerations we would like to focus our study on the case of harmonic polynomials that is polynomials of the form q z z f z g z with deg q 3 in the case when g z z we have lemma 2 2 43 32 20 card z f z z 7 observe that be zout s theorem predicts card z f z z 9 so lemma 2 2 produces a better upper bound for the number of zeros however to get at least 7 points is not generally easy because most complex cubic harmonic polynomials have 5 or fewer zeros one way to maximize the number of zeros is to impose symmetry conditions on the zero set k also for a polynomial of the form z 3 z z it is clear that 0 k and that z k whenever z k another natural condition is to require that k be symmetric with respect to the line y x which in complex notation is z iz when this is required we obtain ir and r thus the column relation becomes z 3 itz uz with t u r under these conditions one needs to find only two points one on the line y x the other outside that line we thus consider the harmonic polynomial q 7 z z z 3 itz uz with u t r 7 lemma 2 3 let q 7 be as above and assume 0 u t 2 u then card z q 7 7 in fact z q 7 0 p iq q ip r ir 2 1 where p q r 0 t 4 pq u p 2 q 2 and r 2 t u 2 cf figure 2 proof we begin with a simple observation for any pair of positive numbers u and t such that 0 u t 2 u one can always find a unique pair of positive numbers p and q such that u p 2 q 2 and t 4 pq for consider the functions p u cos and q u sin on the interval 12 4 it is straightforward to verify that p 2 q 2 u and that 4 p q 2 u sin 2 so that 4 p q maps 12 4 onto u 2 u it follows that any positive number t between u and 2 u can be uniquely represented as 4 pq with p 2 q 2 u also observe that neither p nor q can be zero and that p 6 q next we identify the two real polynomials re q 7 x 3 3 xy 2 ty ux and im q 7 y 3 3 x 2 y tx uy whose graphs are shown in figure 1 and calculate res x resultant re q 7 im q 7 y which is the determinant of the associated sylvester matrix i e res x det 3 x t x 3 ux 0 0 0 3 x t x 3 ux 0 0 0 3 x t x 3 ux 1 0 3 x 2 u tx 0 0 1 0 3 x 2 u tx x 2 x 2 u t 2 x 2 u t 16 x 4 16 ux 2 t 2 2 2 as shown in real algebraic geometry the resultant detects the common zeros of re q 7 and im q 7 3 from 2 2 we immediately observe that 1 one zero of q 7 the origin comes from the linear factor x 2 two zeros of q 7 come from the factors 2 x 2 u t and 2 x 2 u t which obviously cannot be simultaneously zero 3 four zeros which are necessarily located outside the bisector z iz come from the factor 16 x 4 16 x 2 u t 2 it is then clearly sufficient to prove the result for the case u 0 which using 2 above consists of analyzing the factor 2 x 2 u t thus the condition u t is essential to have two points on the bisector z iz besides the origin it remains to investigate 3 above toward this end consider 16 x 4 16 x 2 u t 2 0 then x 2 2 u 4 u 2 t 2 4 where the right hand side is always positive under the second necessary condition 4 u 2 t 2 0 now recall that there exists a unique pair p q of positive distinct 8 numbers such that u p 2 q 2 and t 4 pq thus the expression 4 u 2 t 2 equals 4 p 2 q 2 16 p 2 q 2 4 p 2 q 2 2 it now follows easily that x p or x q depending on whether p q or p q with this at hand it is straightforward to identify the 7 points as listed in 2 1 see figure 2 remark 2 4 the fact that q 7 has the maximum number of zeros predicted by lemma 2 2 is significant to us in that each sextic tmp with invertible m 2 and a column relation of the form q 7 z z 0 either does not admit a representing measure or is necessarily extremal as a consequence the existence of a representing measure will be estab lished once we prove that such a tmp is consistent this means that for each polynomial p of degree at most 6 that vanishes on z q 7 we must verify that p 0 2 1 the hidden column relation since rankm 3 7 there must be another column relation besides q 7 z z 0 and its conjugate clearly the columns 1 z z z 2 z z z 2 z z 2 must be linearly independent otherwise m 3 would be a flat extension of m 2 so the new column relation must involve both z z 2 and z 2 z in what follows we prove that the hidden column relation r z z 0 is uniquely determined by the zero set of q 7 with the notation of theorem 2 3 let p 0 0 p 1 p iq p 2 p 1 p 3 q ip p 4 p 3 p 5 r ir and p 6 p 5 let r denote the polynomial giving rise to the column relation r z z 0 since the coefficients of z z 2 and z 2 z are nonzero without loss of generality we can assume that the coefficient of z 2 z is 1 that is r z z z 2 z a 12 z z 2 a 20 z 2 a 11 z z a 02 z 2 a 10 z a 01 z a 00 by evaluating at p 0 it is easy to see that a 00 0 moreover the evaluations at pi i 1 6 can be presented as r p 1 r p 2 r p 3 r p 4 r p 5 r p 6 p 1 2 p 1 p 2 2 p 2 p 3 2 p 3 p 4 2 p 4 p 5 2 p 5 p 6 2 p 6 p 1 p 1 p 2 1 p 1 p 1 p 1 2 p 1 p 2 1 p 2 p 2 p 2 2 p 2 p 2 p 2 2 p 2 p 2 2 p 3 p 3 p 2 3 p 3 p 3 p 3 2 p 3 p 2 3 p 4 p 4 p 2 4 p 4 p 4 p 4 2 p 4 p 2 4 p 5 p 5 p 2 5 p 5 p 5 p 5 2 p 5 p 2 5 p 6 p 6 p 2 6 p 6 p 6 p 6 2 p 6 p 2 6 a 01 a 10 a 02 a 11 a 20 a 12 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 a calculation using mathematica 44 shows that the determinant of the 6 6 matrix in 2 3 is 128 1 i p q 4 p q 2 r 2 p 2 q 2 2 r 2 since p 2 q 2 u and 2 r 2 t u we see that the last factor is 2 u t and as a result the above mentioned determinant is different from zero it follows that there exists 9 exactly one monic polynomial r vanishing in the 7 point set z q 7 on the other hand it is not hard to see that the polynomial qlc z z i z iz z z u cf 1 6 2 4 vanishes in the zero set of q 7 and it is monic so it must be r we have thus found the hidden column relation it is qlc z z z 2 z iz z 2 uz iuz 0 remark 2 5 since qlc z z i z iz z z u it is straightforward to see that the zero set of qlc is the union of a line and a circle and that z q 7 z qlc see figure 2 0 0 r r r r p q q p p q q p figure 2 the sets z q 7 and z qlc here r t u 2 p 1 2 2 u 4 u 2 t 2 and p 2 q 2 u 3 main theorem we are ready to prove theorem 1 5 which we restate for the reader s con venience theorem 3 1 let m 3 0 with m 2 0 and q 7 z z 0 for u t r and q 7 qlc defined as in 1 5 and 1 6 assume that 0 u t 2 u the following statements are equivalent i there exists a representing measure for m 3 ii qlc 0 zqlc 0 10 iii re 12 im 12 u re 01 im 01 22 t u 11 2 u im 02 iv qlc z z 0 to prove theorem 3 1 we will need the following auxiliary result lemma 3 2 representation of polynomials for u and t as in theorem 3 1 let p 6 p c 6 z z p z q 7 0 and let i p c 6 z z p fq 7 gq 7 hqlc for some f g h c 3 z z then p 6 i proof clearly i p 6 we shall show that dim i dim p 6 let t c 30 c 6 z z be given by a 00 a 30 b 00 b 30 c 00 c 30 7 a 00 a 01 z a 10 z a 30 z 3 q 7 b 00 b 01 z b 10 z b 30 z 3 q 7 c 00 c 01 z c 10 z c 30 z 3 qlc recall that 30 dim c 30 dim ker t dim ran t by the fundamental theorem of linear algebra and observe that i ran t so that dim i rank t to find rank t we first determine dim ker t using gaussian elimination with the aid of mathematica 44 we can prove that dim ker t 9 whenever ut 6 0 it follows that rank t 30 9 21 that is dim i 21 now consider the evaluation map s c 6 z z c 7 given by s p z z p w 0 w 0 p w 1 w 1 p w 2 w 2 p w 3 w 3 p w 4 w 4 p w 5 w 5 p w 6 w 6 we know that dim ker s dim ran s dim c 6 z z 28 using lagrange interpolation we can verify that s is onto i e rank s 7 for if we define j z z 6 i 0 i 6 j z wi wj wi then s j z z ej 1 where ej is the euclidean basis element in c 7 for j 0 6 thus e 1 e 7 ran s now it is straightforward to note that ker s p 6 and since dim c 6 z z 28 it follows that dim ker s 21 and a fortiori that dim p 6 21 therefore dim i 21 dim p 6 and since i p 6 we have established that i p 6 as desired proof of theorem 3 1 conditions ii iii and iv are easily seen to be equivalent so we focus on the proof of i ii 11 let be a representing measure we know that 7 rank m 3 card supp card z q 7 7 so that supp z q 7 and rank m 3 7 thus q 7 q 7 d 0 similarly since supp z qlc we also have qlc zqlc 0 as desired we will apply 14 theorem 4 2 that is we will verify 1 3 consistency of m 3 first recall that q 7 z z 0 or equivalently m 3 q 7 0 so that fq 7 m 3 q 7 f 0 for each polynomial f in z and z of degree at most 3 from which it follows that the riesz functional annihilates all polynomials of the form fq 7 if deg f 3 using q 7 and 2 4 we can prove that z izjqlc 0 for all 0 i j 3 for example z qlc izqlc z iz z 2 z iz z 2 iuz uz uz 2 z z 3 uz 2 z 3 z uz 2 z q 7 itz uz uz 2 q 7 itz uz z z q 7 q 7 z and therefore z qlc i zqlc 0 rather than testing all possible mono mials we proceed as follows first we can reduce each polynomial z izjqlc for 2 i j 3 by using the identity z 3 itz uz mod ker for example z 2 qlc z 2 z 2 z iz z 2 iuz uz z 2 z 3 iz z 4 uz z 2 iuz 3 z 2 q 7 itz uz iz z q 7 itz uz uz z 2 iu q 7 itz uz i t u qlc hq 7 for some polynomial h indeed h z z z 2 iz z iu similarly we have z zqlc t u qlc mod ker z 3 qlc t u z q 7 mod ker z z 2 qlc i t u z q 7 mod ker second note that the riesz functional is invariant under conjugation and that qlc qlc now we compute the riesz functional for each polynomial of the form z izjqlc for 0 i j 3 suppose that qlc 0 and zqlc 0 12 then z qlc z qlc zqlc 0 z 2 qlc i t u qlc 0 z zqlc i t u qlc 0 z 2 qlc z 2 qlc z 2 qlc 0 z 3 qlc t u z qlc 0 z z 2 qlc i t u z qlc 0 z 2 zqlc z z 2 qlc 0 z 3 qlc z 3 qlc 0 it follows that for f g h c 3 z z we have fq 7 gq 7 hqlc 0 consistency will be established once we show that all degree 6 polynomials vanishing in z q 7 are of the form fq 7 gq 7 hqlc but this is the content of lemma 3 2 4 some concrete examples example 4 1 the case of a column relation associated with an irreducible cubic consider m 3 given as 1 0 0 11 i 14 13 14 11 i 14 0 0 0 0 0

224 227 i 224 277 224 using the nested determinants test and smul jan s theorem theorem 1 1 it can be verified that m 3 is positive semidefinite and is of rank 7 with the three 13 column relations z 3 2 iz 5 4 z z 2 z i 5 4 z 5 4 z iz z 2 and z 3 2 iz 5 4 z notice that t 2 and u 5 4 the associated algebraic variety consists of exactly 7 points z 1 0 z 2 1 1 2 i z 3 1 2 i z 4 1 12 i z 5 1 2 i z 6 6 4 6 4 i and z 7 6 4 6 4 i thus is extremal and the main theorem implies that m 3 has a 7 atomic representing measure by the flat extension theorem 5 remark 3 15 theorem 5 4 corollary 5 12 theorem 5 13 and corollary 5 15 the densities can be computed by solving a vandermonde equation the representing measure is given by 7 i 1 i zi where the densities i 1 7 for 1 i 7 the next example shows that a column relation allowing 7 points does not guarantee the existence of a representing measure even though the moment matrix is positive semidefinite and recursively generated example 4 2 the case of a column relation with 7 points and no representing measure consider m 3 given as 1 0 0 11 i 14 13 14 11 i 14 0 0 0 0 0 13 14 11 i 14 0 0 0 7 i 8 21 20 7 i 8 23 56 0 11 i 14 13 14 0 0 0 23 56 7 i 8 21 20 7 i 8 11 i 14 0 0 21 20 7 i 8 23 56 0 0 0 0 13 14 0 0 7 i 8 21 20 7 i 8 0 0 0 0 11 i 14 0 0 23 56 7 i 8 21 20 0 0 0 0 0 7 i 8 23 56 0 0 0 277 224 161 i 160 7 16 61 i 224 0 21 20 7 i 8 0 0 0 161 i 160 277 224 161 i 160 7 16 0 7 i 8 21 20 0 0 0 7 16 161 i 160 277 224 161 i 160 0 23 56 7 i 8 0 0 0 61 i 224 7 16 161 i 160 277 224 14 applying smul jan s theorem theorem 1 1 we know m 3 is positive semidef inite if and only if m 3 b the compression of m 3 to the rows and columns in dexed by the basis b for cm 3 is positive semidefinite using mathematica 44 we can verify that all nested determinants of m 3 b are positive and therefore it follows that m 3 is positive semidefinite row reduction via mathematica shows m 3 has only two column relations z 3 2 iz 5 4 z and its conjugate z 3 2 iz 5 4 z and hence m 3 has rank 8 as seen in example 4 1 the zero set of the polynomial z 3 2 iz 5 4 z consists of 7 points and therefore the algebraic variety has at most 7 points as a result the variety condition 1 4 fails and therefore there is no representing measure we end this section by introducing another class of cubic harmonic poly nomials with real coefficients only we discovered this class independently of the previous class using symmetry later we learned that the two classes are indeed equivalent at least from the perspective of tmp via a degree one transformation corollary 4 3 suppose m 3 the associated moment matrix of a moment sequence is positive semidefinite and satisfies the column relation w 3 2 w w 4 1 for 0 2 and m 2 0 then has a representing measure if and only if q lc 0 and wq lc 0 where q lc w w w 2 w w w 2 w w proof we will prove this using the equivalence of tmp under degree one transformations consider the degree one transformation w z z 1 i z and let m 3 be the moment matrix at the z z level now we can transform a column relation in m 3 using that is p w w j p z z as in proposition 1 3 in the specific case of the column relation 4 1 we easily obtain z 3 i z 2 z in the column space of m 3 and therefore z 3 i z 2 z we then take t and u 2 in theorem 3 1 to get 0 2 moreover in this case the hidden column relation is z 2 z iz z 2 uz iuz 0 15 it follows that at the w w level the hidden column relation is w 2 w w w 2 2 uw 2 uw 0 i e q lc w w 0 this completes the proof the polynomial r w w w 3 2 w w which defines the column relation in 4 1 has
