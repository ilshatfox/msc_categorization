shift operators having the property of moment infinite divisibility that is for any p 0 the shift is subnormal when every weight equivalently every moment is raised to the p th power by reconsidering sequence conditions for the weights or moments of the shift we obtain a new characterization for such shifts and we prove that such shifts are under mild conditions robust under a variety of operations and also rigid in certain senses in particular a weighted shift whose weight sequence has a limit is moment infinitely divisible if and only if its aluthge transform is we also consider

classical sequence space 2 with weight sequence 0 1 which are not only subnormal but which have the stronger property that for each p 0 the shift w p corresponding to the weight sequence p p 0 p 1 remains subnormal such shifts are called moment infinitely divisible see 6 for an initial study and justification of this terminology and we write mid for the class of such shifts in this paper we consider approaches to this problem based on properties of the sequence of weights or the sequence of moments definitions reviewed below these approaches fall in the agler embry or n contractivity approach to subnormality of contraction operators in a subsequent paper we will consider approaches rooted in the bram halmos k hyponormality approach to subnormality the organization of this paper is as follows in section 2 we present the main results of this paper and their relevance in and connections with the existing literature in the remainder of this section we shall give notation and terminology and certain needed or motivational background results in section 3 we will first modify a result from 6 to give a new characterization of moment infinite divisibility in section 4 we will present some consequences of the tools in section 3 including in particular discussion of the aluthge transform and the result that under mild hypotheses a weighted shift is mid if and only if its aluthge transform is to set the notation for weighted shifts let n 0 0 1 and denote by 2 the classical hilbert space 2 n 0 with canonical basis e 0 e 1 note that we begin in dexing at zero let 0 1 be a bounded weight sequence and letw be the weighted shift defined by its action on the basis w ej jej 1 and the assumption of linearity for all questions of interest in this paper it is without loss of general ity to assume that the weight sequence is positive and we do henceforth without further mention the moments n n 0 of the shift are defined by 0 1 and n n 1 j 0 2 j for n 1 we recall see 10 iii 8 16 21 that a weighted shift w is subnormal if and only if it has a berger measure meaning a probability measure supported on 0 w 2 and satisfying n w 2 0 tnd t n 0 1 moment infinite divisibility of weighted shifts sequence conditions 3 applying the cauchy schwarz inequality in l 2 to the monomials sn 2 and s n 2 2 one obtains 2 n 1 n n 2 n 0 and therefore 2 n 2 n 1 n 0 recall that an operator t satisfying t t tt 0 is called hyponormal and it is readily seen that for a weighted shift w this is exactly 2 n 2 n 1 for all n 0 the agler embry characterization of subnormality for a contractive operator t that is t 1 is based on the notion of n contractivity see 1 an operator is n contractive n 1 2 if an t n i 0 1 i n i t i t i 0 1 1 the characterization is that a contractive operator is subnormal if and only if it is n contractive for all positive integers n it is well known and simply a computation following from the fact that w iw i is diagonal that for a shift it suffices to test this condition on basis vectors and that a weighed shift is n contractive if and only if n i 0 1 i n i k i 0 k 0 1 let be the forward difference operator on sequences that is for any sequence a aj j 0 a j aj aj 1 and define the iterated forward difference operators n by 0 a a and n n 1 for n 1 to ease the notation slightly in some settings set for any n 1 and k 0 ta n k na k n i 0 1 i n i ai k where we will suppress the dependence on the sequence a and write simply t n k if no confusion will arise with a slight abuse of language say that a sequence a is n contractive if ta n k 0 for all k 0 1 we will similarly employ lta n k n ln a k n i 0 1 i n i ln ai k 4 chafiq benhida rau l e curto and george r exner when we wish to consider properties arising from the logs of the sequence terms in the case of a weighted shift w it is possible to establish via mathematical induction on n that lt n 1 k lt 2 n k 2 lt n k 1 2 where denotes the sequence of moments and 2 the sequence of weights squared the induction step requires the binomial identity n 2 i n 1 i n 1 i 1 and the fact that ln i k 1 ln i k ln 2 i k there is alternative language for these and related concepts a sequence a is n monotone if ta n k na k 0 for all k 0 1 n hypermonotone if it is j monotone for all j 1 n and completely monotone if it is n monotone for all n 1 2 a sequence is n alternating if ta n k na k 0 for all k 0 1 n hyperalternating if it is j alternating for all j 1 n and completely alternating if it is n alternating for all n 1 2 we shall say that a sequence is n log monotone respectively completely log monotone n log alternating completely log alternating if the sequence ln aj is n monotone respectively completely monotone n alternating completely alternating recall that an operator t has a polar decomposition t u t where t t t 1 2 and u is a partial isometry satisfying the kernel condition keru ker t ker t the much studied aluthge transform of t see for example 2 3 19 23 28 is at t t 1 2 u t 1 2 and we define the iterated aluthge transform at n in the obvious way it is merely a computation that if w is a weighted shift then at w is again a weighted shift with weight sequence 0 1 1 2 it is useful to note in considering mid weighted shifts that raising every weight to the p th power is equivalent to raising every moment to the p th power we refer the reader to 6 for an initial study of moment infinite divisibility this paper constitutes a continuation of that study we will reference the k hyponormality approach to subnormality only in passing but for the convenience of the reader we give a very abbreviated version of this background see 13 for a full discussion recall that it is the bram halmos charac terization of subnormality see 8 that an operator t is subnormal if and only if for every k 1 2 a certain k 1 k 1 operator matrix an t is positive given moment infinite divisibility of weighted shifts sequence conditions 5 k 1 an operator is k hyponormal whenever this positivity condition holds for k for weighted shifts it is well known that k hyponormality reduces to the positivity for each n of the k 1 k 1 hankel moment matrix a n k 12 theorem 4 where a n k n n 1 n k n 1 n 2 n k 1 n k n k 1 n 2 k the bram halmos k hyponormality approach to subnormality has been more thor oughly studied than the agler embry n contractivity approach see 13 and 15 for some of the beginnings of this considerable body of work 2 description of main results in this section we list the main results of this paper and indicate how they connect with results in the existing literature first recall that a sequence of moments is log completely monotone if lt n k n i 0 1 i n i ln i k 0 for all n 1 and k 0 on the other hand a sequence 2 of weights squared is completely alternating if t 2 n k n i 0 1 i n i 2 i k 0 for all n 1 and k 0 it is well known that a general sequence is completely alternating if and only if the sequence t e t is completely monotone for all t 0 7 prop 6 10 in 6 theorem 3 1 we proved that a contractive weighted shift w is mid if and only if the sequence of weights squared 2 n is log completely alternating our first main result is proposition 3 3 and its companion theorems 3 4 and 3 5 asserting that 2 is log completely alternating is log completely monotone where is the moment sequence of thus we establish a two way bridge between weights squared sequences and the associated moment sequences not known before this is represented by the double arrow in the diagram on page 9 next we substantially expand the collection of sequences which are known to be log completely alternating by proving in theorem 4 2 that a non decreasing sequence a is log completely alternating if and only if the quotient sequence bn anan 1 is log completely alternating with these results in hand we proceed to establish a 6 chafiq benhida rau l e curto and george r exner link with the aluthge transform given a contractive weighted shift w such that limn n exists so in particular if w is hyponormal then at w mid w mid this provides a new way to determine whether a hyponormal contractive weighted shift is mid in corollary 4 6 we prove that in fact any of the iterated aluthge transforms of w can be used instead of at w we also complete a full circle of equivalent conditions by establishing that for contractive hyponormal weighted shifts w 1 2 mid w mid at w mid where w 1 2 is the schur square root of w we do this in corollary 4 7 and bring closure to a question in 14 our next main result is theorem 4 16 in which we prove that the aluthge trans form when restricted to the class mid is a bijection this means in particular that every agler shift ak is the aluthge transform of a contractive weighted shift in proposition 4 17 we calculate the precise form of at 1 ak recall that the k th agler shift ak is that with weight sequence k n n 0 with k n n 1 n k for k 2 3 and n 0 1 in proposition 4 28 we establish a flatness result for the class mid concretely we prove that if a contractive weighted shift w is mid and for some n 1 and k 0 one has lt n k 0 then w is flat that is 0 1 2 3 along the way we present operations on sequences which involve quotients aluthge transforms generalized aluthge transforms limits and subshifts our study includes several examples of mid unilateral weighted shifts even some whose subnormality was not previously known although we do not pursue this point of view here each mid weighted shift yields in the hankel matrices of its moments examples of infinitely divisible matrices see 5 some of which are also new 3 sequence conditions for moment infinite divisibility we turn shortly to proving some results comparing various properties for a real sequence in the sequel usually to be a sequence of weights or moments or their logs moment infinite divisibility of weighted shifts sequence conditions 7 of a shift we begin with one fundamental to the point of view of this paper and deduce a new characterization of moment infinite divisibility for weighted shifts our starting point is a characterization of moment infinite divisibility for contrac tive weighted shifts in terms of sequences cf 6 theorem 3 1 6 theorem 3 1 a contractive weighted shiftw is moment infinitely divisible in symbols w mid if and only if the sequence of weights squared or equivalently the sequence of weights is log completely alternating we seek a relationship between log completely alternating weights and log com pletely monotone moments for a shift but first need a lemma lemma 3 2 let n k be positive integers with 0 k n then k i 0 1 i n i 1 k n 1 k 3 1 proof for a fixed n do finite induction on k and use pascal s identity proposition 3 3 the weights squared w 2 n n 0 equivalently the weights of a con tractive weighted shift are log completely alternating if and only if the moments of the shift are log completely monotone proof suppose the weights squared are log completely alternating it is a computa tion to check from the definitions that ln n lnw 2 n for all n 0 since each wn 1 we have that is 1 log monotone it is well known that for any sequence a and any k k 1 a n ka n ka n 1 for all n 0 and this together with an induction based on ln n lnw 2 n yields as in 6 remark 2 6 that k 1 ln n k lnw 2 n for all k n 0 since w 2 n is log completely alternating it results that is log completely monotone as the steps above are reversible and using again that wn 1 for all n the reverse implication follows as well the following characterization is then immediate 8 chafiq benhida rau l e curto and george r exner theorem 3 4 a contractive weighted shift w is mid if and only if the sequence of moments is log completely monotone we digress for a moment to point out a fundamental difference between conditions on moments and conditions on weights in general conditions on weights are robust under scaling and in particular scaling is harmless for subnormality or moment infi nite divisibility results as indicated by the following in comparison with improvement of theorem 3 1 theorem 3 5 suppose w is a weighted shift with weight sequence if the weight sequence is log completely alternating equivalently the squared sequence 2 n n 0 is log completely alternating then w is mid and therefore subnormal proof supposing first that w is a contraction this follows immediately from the orem 3 1 and proposition 3 3 for general w consider the shift w with weight sequence n satisfying n n w the weights n are clearly log completely alternating so w is mid surely if w p is subnormal for some p 0 it is imme diate from the definitions that w p w pw p is subnormal and moment infinite divisibility follows for w this clearly differs for moment conditions since the moments of a scaled shift are not the straightforward scaling of the original moments alternatively one may note that the agler conditions for subnormality which conditions are of moment type do assume that the operator is a contraction recall that from 6 prop 2 4 that for positive term sequences completely alternat ing implies log completely alternating the containment reverses when we move to completely monotone and log completely monotone contractive sequences corollary 3 6 we have for contractive positive term sequences that log completely monotone implies completely monotone proof by the above log completely monotone for a contractive sequence yields that the shift ismid and in particular subnormal which means that its moment sequence is completely monotone moment infinite divisibility of weighted shifts sequence conditions 9 note that implicit in the above is that a strong condition at the level of weights log completely alternating is equivalent to a strong condition at the level of mo ments log completely monotone the situation is well captured by the following diagram weights squared completely alternating shift is mid add property 6 weights squared log completely alternating shift is mid moments log completely monotone shift is mid 6 moments completely monotone shift is subnormal we recall that a completely alternating sequence is log completely alternating and the reverse need not hold and so weights completely alternating is a sufficient con dition for moment infinite divisibility on the other hand it is not known what additional property the stronger condition gives for a weighted shift remark 3 7 we pause for a moment to consider some alternative potential def initions of n log alternating for sequences observe that 1 log alternating for a sequence an is log an log an 1 0 which is simply an an 1 and which is familiar for weights as non decreasing i e the shift is hyponormal and 2 log alternating is log an 2 log an 1 log an 2 0 which translates to log anan 2 a 2 n 1 0 that is anan 2 a 2 n 1 1 10 chafiq benhida rau l e curto and george r exner or anan 2 a 2 n 1 this property has been studied by many authors under the name log concave it has the companion condition log convex which is as expected anan 2 a 2 n 1 the papers 24 and 26 contain some references to these studies other authors have considered generalizations of this to other n again see 26 but they are not the generalizations provided by the n log alternating or n log monotone ones we consider these authors generalize 2 log concave as follows define a map l on sequences by l ak bk where b 0 a 20 and bk a 2 k ak 1 ak 1 for k 1 it is obvious that a sequence ak is log concave 2 log concave if the sequence l ak is non negative they then define n log concave by iteration the sequence ak is said to be n log concave if the sequence ln 1 ak is non negative there is a similarly defined companion notion of n log convex it is simple to check that these are not the same as our version in either the concave or convex case if n 3 one result is that every stieltjes moment sequence is infinitely log convex meaning of course that it is n log convex for every n in 26 theorem 2 3 recall that a sequence of positive numbers is a stieltjes moment sequence if it consists of the power moments of a positive borel measure on 0 there is no example given of an infinite sequence which is infinitely log concave their version of infinitely log convex is surely different from that used here completely log monotone since it includes all stieltjes moment sequences and an even larger class so it is perhaps surprising that apparently it is hard to be infinitely log concave observe that the weights squared of the bergman shift a shift with extremely good properties are not even 3 log concave according to their generalization 4 consequences for the class mid we seek to show in this section that moment infinite divisibility of a weighted shift is robust under a variety of operations in particular the aluthge transform and is rigid in certain senses moment infinite divisibility of weighted shifts sequence conditions 11 4 1 a quotient operation and the aluthge transform a starting point is a very useful and somewhat surprising result about log completely alternating se quences proposition 4 1 suppose a an is a log completely alternating sequence with positive terms and let n n then the sequence b defined by bn anan n is log completely alternating sketch of proof choose n as in the statement use for the differences of the original sequence log a and for the differences of log b it is a computation to show that for any k 1 k 2 k 2 k 1 2 k n 1 an indication of what is needed is to note that with n 3 log a 0 a 3 log a 1 a 4 log a 0 log a 1 log a 3 log a 4 log a 0 2 log a 1 log a 2 log a 1 2 log a 2 log a 3 log a 2 2 log a 3 log a 4 which is precisely 1 0 2 0 2 1 2 2 but then 2 k 1 k 1 k 1 2 k 2 k 1 2 k n 1 2 k 1 2 k 2 2 k n 2 k 2 k 1 2 k 1 2 k 2 2 k n 1 2 k n 3 k 3 k 1 3 k n 1 extending this result to higher order differences by induction and using that a an is log completely alternating we obtain that b bn is log completely alternating note that there is a version of this at the level of n as opposed to at the level of all indeed if an is k 1 log alternating then bn is k log alternating observe that there is no assumption that the sequence is bounded a corollary is immediate 12 chafiq benhida rau l e curto and george r exner theorem 4 2 let a an be a non decreasing sequence of positive numbers then a is log completely alternating if and only if the quotient sequence b with bn an an 1 is log completely alternating proof for the only if it is easy to see that the test for n log alternating for b is the test for n 1 log alternating for a and we get 1 log alternating for a since the an are non decreasing the forward direction follows from proposition 4 1 corollary 4 3 let w be a contractive hyponormal weighted shift then w is mid if and only if w is mid where is the quotient sequence n n n 1 observe that some assumption on the sequence a respectively the weight sequence in theorem 4 2 resp corollary 4 3 is required because if b is the moment sequence of the dirichlet shift the canonical completely hyperexpansive operator and 2 isometry which is not subnormal a sequence a whose quotient is b will be decreasing indeed record for future use that if b is the quotient sequence of a then an a 0 n 1 i 0 bi 4 1 we record also that if is a weight sequence and its quotient weight sequence then the moment sequences satisfy n 1 n n 1 in light of these clearly one could replace the assumption above that the sequence a is increasing with the assumption that the sequence b is bounded above by 1 or in the corollary that w is a contraction we pause briefly to to exhibit an example of anmid shift arising from the quotient operation of corollary 4 3 example 4 4 the weighted shift with weights n n 1 n 3 n 2 2 1 2 is mid and hence in particular subnormal in fact this is the quotient operation of corollary 4 2 applied to the moment infinitely divisible bergman shift b moment infinite divisibility of weighted shifts sequence conditions 13 we remark that for the weighted shift in example 4 4 we know both the berger measure for the moments t 1 2 0 1 t dt 1 2 1 t dt and a levy khinchin measure see 7 chapter 4 prop 6 12 for the weights squared ln t 0 1 t dt where 1 denotes the usual dirac point mass at 1 these may be checked by straightforward computations once the candidate is guessed note that in this case there is a levy khinchin measure for the weights squared because they are not only log completely alternating but actually completely alternating and note also that we may do the same thing or do the quotient operation multiple times for any of the agler shifts with proposition 4 1 in hand we may give an example of the robustness of mo ment infinite divisibility of weighted shifts recall that if w and w are subnormal respectively mid weighted shifts then the schur product shift with weights n n is subnormal respectively mid this follows from a k hyponormality ap proach and the standard positivity fact about schur products of matrices theorem 4 5 suppose w is a contractive weighted shift whose weights approach a limit in particular if w is hyponormal then the aluthge transform at w is mid if and only if w is sketch of proof if w is mid its weights squared sequence is log completely al ternating and it follows from a trivial computation that the weight sequence for at w 0 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 6 7 4 2 is log completely alternating for the other direction consider the weight sequence for at w as in 4 2 by taking the usual quotient of successive entries corollary 4 2 we obtain that 0 2 1 3 2 4 3 5 4 6 4 3 is log completely alternating taking the schur product of this last and the tail of 4 2 beginning with 2 3 3 4 we obtain that 0 3 1 4 2 5 3 6 4 7 5 8 6 9 4 4 14 chafiq benhida rau l e curto and george r exner is log completely alternating use the operation in proposition 4 1 with n 3 applied to the sequence in 4 4 to obtain that 0 6 1 7 2 8 3 9 4 10 4 5 is log completely alternating form the schur product of this with the tail of 4 2 beginning with 6 7 7 8 this yields that 0 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 14 4 6 is log completely alternating repeat the operation from proposition 4 1 on the sequence in 4 6 this time with n 7 to yield that the sequence 0 7 7 14 1 8 8 15 which is 0 14 1 15 2 16 3 17 4 18 4 7 is log completely alternating by continuing this process indefinitely one may obtain that for some m as large as desired the sequence 0 m 1 m 1 2 m 2 3 m 3 4 m 4 4 8 is log completely alternating there is no claim that one can do this for any m but only that we may do it so as to obtain some m large now consider some test for the sequence 0 1 2 to be say 2 log al ternating this is for example log 0 2 log 1 log 2 0 and suppose for a contradiction that the left hand side is strictly positive we have that 0 log 0 m 2 log 1 m 1 log 2 m 2 log 0 2 log 1 log 2 log m 2 log m 1 log m 2 for large m as above but since the weights approach a limit say l the term log m 2 log m 1 log m 2 approaches 0 and taking into account the assumed signs this yields a contradiction moment infinite divisibility of weighted shifts sequence conditions 15 corollary 4 6 suppose w is a contractive weighted shift whose weights approach a limit in particular if w is hyponormal then w is mid if and only if any of the iterated aluthge transforms of w is mid and in this case all the iterated aluthge transforms are mid proof it is routine that if the weights of w approach a limit then so do the weights of any of the iterated aluthge transforms for the next result we recall that the schur square root of a weighted shift w is defined as the weighted shift with weight sequence n n 0 corollary 4 7 supposew is a contractive hyponormal weighted shift thenw 1 2 the schur square root of w is mid if and only if the aluthge transform of w is mid proof surely w is mid if and only if w 1 2 is we know in general that if the schur square root of any shift is subnormal then the aluthge transform is but the reverse question is essentially open recall that there are generalizations of the aluthge transform which are asymmet ric while the usual aluthge transform of an operator t is at t t 1 2 u t 1 2 where t u t is the standard polar decomposition of t we may consider for any 0 q 1 atq t t qu t 1 q it is straightforward to check that for a weighted shift w with weight sequence 0 1 one has atq w is again a weighted shift with the weight sequence 1 q 0 q 1 1 q 1 q 2 1 q 2 q 3 ifw is mid it is immediate that atq w is mid by considering schur products with some preliminary work we may obtain a partial converse definition 4 8 given the sequences a an n 0 and b bn n 0 we say that a negatively dominates b and write a b if ma j mb j m n 0 j n 0 the next two results are just computations proposition 4 9 suppose a an n 0 is completely alternating and a b bn n 0 and let r satisfy 0 r 1 then a rb an rbn n 0 is completely alternating 16 chafiq benhida rau l e curto and george r exner corollary 4 10 if ln an n 0 and ln bn n 0 are defined ln an n 0 is completely alternating and negatively dominates ln bn n 0 and 0 r 1 then ln anbrn is completely alternating proposition 4 11 suppose a an n 0 is completely alternating and 0 r 1 let n n 0 then a b where b is defined by bn ran n proof for any m one readily computes that since m 1 a j 0 for all j 0 1 ma j ma j 1 for all j 0 1 it then follows that ma j ma j n for all j 0 1 so a dominates b in the case r 1 and use the corollary we then have the following corollary 4 12 if ln an n 0 is defined and completely alternating then for any n n 0 and any 0 r 1 ln an ar n n n 0 is completely alternating we may now give the promised partial generalization of the harder direction of theorem 4 5 to some asymmetrical aluthge transforms theorem 4 13 suppose w is a weighted shift whose weights approach a limit in particular if w is hyponormal suppose 0 q 1 2 if the generalized aluthge transform atq w is mid then so is w proof for ease of exposition we will consider the case q 1 3 the modifications for the general case are routine and consist primarily in realizing that certain constants are bounded above in fact by 1 the argument is essentially that of the proof of the result for q 1 2 with modest alterations assume that at 1 3 w is mid so the sequence 2 3 0 1 3 1 2 3 1 1 3 2 2 3 2 1 3 3 4 9 is log completely alternating the goal is to obtain that 0 1 is log completely alternating and it is clearly sufficient to obtain that 2 3 0 2 3 1 is log completely alternating from 4 9 by using corollary 4 12 with n 1 and r 1 2 we obtain that 2 3 0 1 3 1 2 3 1 1 3 2 1 2 2 3 1 1 3 2 2 3 2 1 3 3 1 2 2 3 2 1 3 3 2 3 3 1 3 4 1 2 2 3 0 1 6 2 2 3 1 1 6 3 2 3 2 1 6 4 4 10 moment infinite divisibility of weighted shifts sequence conditions 17 is log completely alternating upon taking the schur product of this with 2 3 2 1 3 3 1 4 2 3 3 1 3 4 1 4 which is log completely alternating as it is a tail of 4 9 to a power we obtain that 2 3 0 1 12 3 2 3 1 1 12 4 2 3 2 1 12 5 4 11 is log completely alternating using this last sequence and corollary 4 12 with n 3 and r 1 8 we obtain that 2 3 0 1 96 6 2 3 1 1 96 7 2 3 2 1 96 8 4 12 is log completely alternating and using a schur product of this with 2 3 6 1 3 7 1 64 2 3 7 1 3 8 1 64 we obtain that 2 3 0 1 192 7 2 3 1 1 192 8 2 3 2 1 192 9 4 13 is log completely alternating the rest of the argument is as in the proof of theorem 4 5 the only point to note is that the exponents of the second terms in the resulting collection of sequences are always less than 1 remark 4 14 we do not know the status of the obvious question concerning atq when q 1 2 returning to consideration of the standard aluthge transform which we now view as a mapping at from operators to operators the result in theorem 4 5 taken with the scaling discussion makes it clear that at mid mid we consider this mapping briefly as one from weighted shifts to weighted shifts and what is in some sense the inverse mapping in which given a target shift w we produce a shift w such that at w w recall that the relationship between the weights is that if w has weight sequence n n 0 then the weight sequence is 0 1 1 2 2 3 18 chafiq benhida rau l e curto and george r exner one readily computes from this that in order to have at w w the weight 0 is a free parameter and all the remaining n are then fixed n n 1 2 j 0 2 2 j 0 n 1 2 j 1 2 2 j 1 n odd 0 n 2 j 1 2 2 j 1 n 2 1 j 0 2 2 j n even 4 14 let l denote the collection of weighted shifts whose weights approach a non zero limit let at denote the aluthge transform map on the collection of bounded weighted shifts we have the following lemma lemma 4 15 the map at l is injective proof let w be some bounded shift such that at w at w w for some weight sequences and write 0 x 0 for some x 0 and suppose limn n l 6 0 using the equations above one obtains that lim j 2 j xl and lim j 2 j 1 1 x l since the sequence n 0 has a limit and l 6 0 clearly x 1 and n 0 and n 0 coincide it is reasonable to consider the map at now restricted to mid weighted shifts since we know at mid mid of course mid weighted shifts have weights approaching a limit since they are bounded and hyponormal so the map is injective for this smaller class the result above can be improved theorem 4 16 the map at mid is a bijection from mid to mid proof from the previous proposition and theorem 4 5 we have that the map is injective and that its range is contained in mid for surjectivity take first the case in which some w in mid has weights increasing to 1 consider the expression for the sequence of odd weights in 4 14 for a candidate pre image w removing for a moment the parameter 0 it is easy to see that the resulting sequence is increasing since one moves from one term to the next by multiplying by some 22 j 22 j 1 and the k moment infinite divisibility of weighted shifts sequence conditions 19 are increasing as well the sequence is bounded above by one since it is a product of terms of the form 22 j 22 j 1 and a single term 2 k 1 therefore it has a limit l satisfying 0 l 1 one may similarly see that the sequence for the even weights in 4 14 again removing for the moment 0 is also increasing bounded above by 1 20 and therefore has a limit which turns out to be 1 l choosing 0 l it is easy to see that the candidate sequence has the limit 1 and satisfies at w w citing again theorem 4 5 w mid we pause for a moment to record the pre images under at of the mid agler shifts recall that the k th agler shift ak is that with weight sequence k n n 0 with k n n 1 n k for k 2 3 and n 0 1 these appear in the foundational paper 1 on n contractivity the most familiar is a 2 which is the bergman shift proposition 4 17 for k 2 3 the agler shift ak is the image under at of the shift w k with initial weight k 0 k 2 k 1 2 4 15 and k n n 2 1 k n 2 k 0 n 1 2 1 2 k n 1 n odd k 0 k n 2 k 1 2 k n 2 2 n 1 2 k 2 1 k n 1 2 n even 4 16 in particular the bergman shift is the aluthge transform of the shift with weight sequence beginning 2 4 8 3 9 32 128 45 the initial weights for the pre images of the first few agler shifts are as follows 20 chafiq benhida rau l e curto and george r exner k 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 initial weight of pre image shift of ak 2 1 2 4 3 3 8 16 15 5 16 32 35 35 128 256 315 63 256 512 693 231 1024 2048 3003 proof this is mainly a computation first one verifies that in advance of knowing k 0 the expressions in 4 14 are as claimed in this particular case it then remains as in the proof of proposition 4 16 to evaluate the limit say of the odd weights this is accomplished using that z a z b za b k 0 gk a b zk where g 0 a b 1 cf 18 5 11 13 note that it is straightforward to compute that the aluthge transform of the bergman shift b is a 1 2 3 as might be suspected from the n 3 entry in the ta ble we now return to the discussion of the aluthge transform and remark that if we seek the inverse aluthge transform of the shift with weights 2 n 2 2 2 n 2 1 those arising from a certain moment sequence with countably atomic berger measure mentioned in 6 the shift known to be mid the appropriate 0 is approximately 0 0 7421267409 but we do not know if the resulting shift has some simple form 4 2 robustness and rigidity the results in the previous subsection may be inter preted to say that the class of mid shifts is robust under some operations quotients of weights for example as implicit in proposition 4 1 or the aluthge transform as in theorem 4 5 we record next some further results in this family some showing rigidity in the class of mid shifts and consider as well back step extensions and completions proposition 4 18 suppose a shift w is the norm limit of contractive mid weighted shifts w j then w is mid moment infinite divisibility of weighted shifts sequence conditions 21 proof any particular test for the weights to be n log alternating is the limit of the related tests for the j to be n log alternating proposition 4 19 suppose a weighted shift w has a berger measure which is the weak limit of the berger measures n of contractive mid weighted shifts w n then w is contractive and mid proof note that the weak limit will satisfy that for any m lim n 1 0 tmd n t 1 0 tmd t therefore moments and hence weights are approximated in the limit it is clear that has support in 0 1 and therefore w is a contraction but now we may cite again that any particular test for the moments to be k log monotone is the limit of the related tests for the moments arising from n to be k log monotone there are results for powers and subshifts first set some notation for subshifts of a weighted shift w a subshift is a shift whose weight sequence is of the form g where g n 0 n 0 is increasing and in this setting means composition call a subshift or subsequence of weights a p subshift if g is linear of the form g n pn k where p k n 0 and p 1 then we have the following proposition 4 20 suppose w is mid then any p subshift of w is mid and so is any positive integer power meaning ordinary not schur power of w infinite divisibility of the latter has to be interpreted either viewing say w 2 as the direct sum of two weighted shifts which we know how to raise to schur powers or viewing w n as a matrix and viewing a schur p th power as raising every entry in the matrix to the p th power proof for the subshift claim we shall use the characterization in theorem 3 1 that the weights squared be log completely alternating and will use induction on n for log n alternating for all n first if w is mid it is subnormal hence hyponormal with non decreasing weights any p subshift is therefore log 1 alternating suppose now that for any mid weighted shift and any p subshift w the subshift is log n alternating consider some expression lt n 1 k to be tested for negativity apply the quotient operation of proposition 4 1 to the tail of the weight sequence 22 chafiq benhida rau l e curto and george r exner starting at k with n set to p to generate a new weighted shift w which is mid by that proposition it is an easy computation to show that lt n 1 k is exactly the expression lt n k and is therefore non positive by the induction hypothesis the result for powers follows from regarding some positive integer power of w as a direct sum of certain weighted shifts see 16 remark 4 21 observe that since we know that certain shifts s a b c d as in definition 2 5 of 17 are mid corollary 3 2 of 6 we obtain as a consequence that all p subshifts of some s a b c d aremid and therefore subnormal generalizing 17 theorem 2 13 note also that in that paper the examples of subnormal shifts for which a p subshift is not subnormal have finitely atomic berger measures which are as expected cf 14 not mid evidence from 27 suggests strongly that there is another approach to the proof of the p subshift portion of proposition 4 20 which is to show any of the p subshift log weight expressions to be tested for alternating ness is in fact a sum with positive coefficients of log weight expressions for the original shift in fact using the same n the coefficients are non trivial however and we do not know how to succeed in this approach finally we have no example of a subnormal weighted shift each of whose p subshifts is subnormal which is not in fact mid we now turn our attention to the matter of back step extensions of mid weighted shifts recall that this means prefixing a weight to the given weight se quence and asking for properties of interest for the new shift here the motivating question is whether one may take an mid contractive weighted shift and produce a back step extension which is subnormal but not mid of course a back step extension to subnormality is not always possible and the relevant modulus of sub normality is to be found in 12 proposition 8 in terms of an integral our only information on the question is the following proposition 4 22 let w be any regular subshift of one of the agler shifts which we know are mid then any subnormal back step extension of w is mid note that if the previous weight of the subshift would require a negative index no subnormal extension is possible at all moment infinite divisibility of weighted shifts sequence conditions 23 proof from 11 we obtain the berger measure of the regular subshifts and compute that if a subnormal back step extension is possible at all then the cutoff is exactly the previous omitted weight in the subsequence in question a back step exten sion with this weight which is a subnormal extension is therefore mid the only flexibility allowed to obtain a subnormal back step extension is to decrease the zeroth weight below the cutoff but we know that a reduction in the zeroth weight preserves moment infinite divisibility by 6 cor 3 3 note that if the subshift begins with the zeroth weight no subnormal extension is possible at all we may also consider the analog of the classical completion question given some initial segment of weights when it is possible to complete these to the weights for a subnormal here mid weighted shift there are two answers in the case of two given weights 0 1 one more interesting than the other for the uninteresting one suppose we have 0 a b 1 first it is easy to check that any two atomic measure with an atom at zero gives an mid weighted shift express the measure as c 0 0 c 1 r where r 0 1 and c 0 c 1 0 1 with c 0 c 1 1 the weights are c 1 r r r then 20 21 r c 1 1 0 and 2 j 2 j 1 0 for j 1 using this and the standard recurrence one finds 20 2 21 22 r c 1 1 0 and 2 j 2 2 j 1 2 j 2 0 j 1 continuing one produces that the weights squared sequence is completely alternating hence log completely alternating and we have that the shift is mid but to use this for the given a and b we must simply arrange c 1 and r so that a c 1 r and b r and we have the completion to an mid weighted shift but the completion is flat see the discussion after question 4 25 and in that sense trivial there is a more interesting completion and the idea is this first any a and b as above such that both a and b are rational numbers have a nontrivial such completion because a and b are two weights of course not necessarily successive in one of the agler shifts by taking the p subshift of that agler shift which has these as the first two weights we get an mid shift because we know that p subshifts of the agler shifts are mid for more general a and b the idea will be to approximate with agler subshifts and take a weak limit of berger measures using weak compactness some care must be taken that we do not collapse to the trivial completion above and for this we require a lemma 24 chafiq benhida rau l e curto and george r exner lemma 4 23 suppose am is one of the agler shifts and we consider the weights p n 1 m n and q n 1 m n as the first two weights of a potential sub shift where is the spacing of the sub shift and 1 observe that the third weight of the sub shift is r n 2 1 m n 2 let g 1 q p the gap between the first two weights and g 2 r q the second gap then g 2 g 1 1 q 1 2 p q 4 17 in particular this fraction is bounded away from zero for any fixed p and q in 0 1 further the expression on the right hand side of 4 17 is increasing in p and de creasing in q proof supposing the expression in 4 17 to be correct the increasing and decreasing claims are merely a matter of derivatives the rest is mostly calculation first g 2 m 1 m n 2 m n and g 1 m 1 m n m n it follows that g 2 g 1 m n 2 m n one shows that to have the right weights requires n 1 pm p 1 and qm qn n 1 q 1 inserting these into the expression for g 2 g 1 yields the claim proposition 4 24 given values a and b satisfying 0 a b 1 it is possible to extend a b to the weight sequence of an mid contractive weighted shift which is not flat moment infinite divisibility of weighted shifts sequence conditions 25 proof observe that it is easy to show that the weights squared of the m th agler shift together with 1 form a partition of 1 m 1 whose largest width is m 1 m m 1 which clearly goes to zero as m becomes large thus given 0 a b 1 we may clearly approximate a and b as closely as we like with weights squared of one of the agler shifts further we may take care to ensure that we approximate a using a weight squared which is smaller and to approximate b using a weight squared which is larger we will choose rational numbers pn and qn such that a lim pn and b lim qn and obtain as above the sub shifts for the pairs pn and qn each comes with a berger measure say n because of weak compactness we may choose a weak convergent subsequence of the n converging to some measure it is easy to check that is a probability measure and yields the correct first two weights a and b consider now the third weight of one of the approximating subshifts it will have the ratio g 2 g 1 no smaller than 1 b 1 2 a b and hence these ratios for all the approximating agler sub shifts will be bounded away from zero since weight information is moment information and hence integrals against t t 2 and t 3 of the appropriate measure this will be preserved in the measure limit thus the measure will yield a weighted shift with the gap ratio g 2 g 1 non zero and hence the third weight will not be equal to the second and the resulting shift cannot be flat it is evident that the procedure yields a contraction and thus it will be mid by proposition 4 19 this gives the desired result we pose some natural questions question 4 25 what condition on three initial weights guarantees an mid com pletion what condition is necessary and sufficient for such a completion there is some information about the first of these questions recall that an operator t is completely hyperexpansive if for all n 1 2 n i 0 1 i n i t it i 0 since if w is completely hyperexpansive the shift with weight sequence the reciprocals of the j is mid 6 corollary 4 1 we may use conditions from 22 to obtain a variety of sufficient conditions for completions we content ourselves with the following which is just reciprocals inserted into 22 proposition 5 2 proposition 4 26 consider three initial weights 0 0 1 2 1 if i 1 21 1 22 2 1 21 1 0 and 26 chafiq benhida rau l e curto and george r exner ii 22 1 21 2 1 20 1 22 21 then 0 1 2 has an extension to the weight sequence of an mid weighted shift since it is known that not everymid shift has a weight sequence whose reciprocals yield a completely hyperexpansive shift see the discussion after 4 proposition 6 it is unsurprising that the condition above is not necessary example 4 27 consider the proposed initial weight sequence 1 3 2 4 3 5 the first three weights of the third agler shift these weights fail condition i in proposition 4 26 yet clearly have a completion to an mid weight sequence we do not know whether it is possible to have a three weight initial segment which can be completed in three ways i to subnormal but not mid ii to mid but not the reciprocal of a completely hyperexpansive shift and iii to such a reciprocal another sort of rigidity concerns an analog to a feature of the standard routes to subnormality of a shift namely k hyponormality and n contractivity various sorts of extremality in the sense that one of the standard positivity tests is actually achieved at zero yield that the shift must be recursively generated have finitely atomic berger measure or sometimes something even more restrictive perhaps the oldest result is that a subnormal weighted shift with two successive weights equal must be flat all or all but one weight equal this is 25 theorem 6 this was later improved to shifts only assumed to be 2 hyponormal in 12 corollary 6 and further to shifts assumed only to be quadratically hyponormal in 9 theorem 1 in 15 theorem 5 12 proposition 5 13 is the result that if for some k deta j k 0 for all j 0 then the shift must be recursively generated in 20 theorem 2 3 we see that if a contractive shift w satisfies an w 0 for some n then w must be the unweighted unilateral shift recall the definition of an t given in 1 1 the following result is a moment infinite divisibility version of this same flavor proposition 4 28 suppose w is a contractive weighted shift which is mid so its moment sequence is log completely monotone and its weight sequence is log completely alternating suppose further that for some n and k lt n k 0 then w is flat proof suppose n and k are as in the statement and consider first the case n 1 we have that log k log k 1 0 but this is log 2 k 0 and so k 1 and since moment infinite divisibility of weighted shifts sequence conditions 27 the weights are increasing and bounded above by 1 we clearly have flatness in the case that n 2 we have log k 2 log k 1 log k 2 0 which is easily equivalent to k 1 k and again we have flatness suppose now that n 3 we have log k 3 log k 1 3 log k 2 log k 3 0 which is equivalent to 2 k 2 k 1 2 k 1 2 k 2 considering the shiftw with k k k 1 and since by corollary 4 2 w is subnormal we have that w is flat therefore k k 1 c for some c satisfying 0 c 1 therefore we have c 2 k 2 k 1 2 k 1 2 k 2 2 k 2 2 k 3 2 k 3 2 k 4 then 2 k 2 1 c 2 k 1 then since 2 k 2 2 k 3 c we obtain that 2 k 3 1 c 2 k 2 1 c 2 2 k 1 repeating the computation we have that 2 k j 1 cj 1 2 k 1 if c 1 clearly the sequence k j j 1 is unbounded a contradiction so c 1 and we have k 2 k 1 yielding flatness for w using again that w is subnormal observe that we have shown both the claim for n 3 and that if w is flat then w is flat in general the proof now finishes by induction since if n 4 we deduce from lt 4 k 0 that lt 3 k 0 that w is flat by the result for n 3 hence w is flat and so on subnormality instead of moment infinite divisibility plus lt n k 0 for some n and k is not sufficient to guarantee flatness as shown by the following example example 4 29 consider the weighted shift w a b c which is the stampfli subnormal completion of the initial weights a b c where b ac using 1 2 one 28 chafiq benhida rau l e curto and george r exner easily checks that lt 3 0 lt 2 2 0 0 moreover w a b c c a c however the shift is not flat we now record another collection of moment infinitely divisible weighted shifts in fact ones whose weights squared are completely alternating instead of merely log completely alternating it is well known that the agler shifts are simply represen tatives of a more general class of shifts with berger measures d t j 1 1 t j 2 0 1 t dt where j 1 the agler shifts are simply those for which j is an integer unsurprisingly the others in the class are moment infinitely divisible proposition 4 30 let s 1 not necessarily an integer and let w be the weighted shift with berger measure d t s 1 1 t s 2 0 1 t dt the weights squared s n 2 of w are completely alternating and therefore w is mid proof one computes readily that the weights squared are s n 2 1 n s n and that m s 2 n 1 s m m i 0 s n i and these are clearly negative acknowledgments the authors wish to express their appreciation for support
