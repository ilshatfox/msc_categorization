weight sequence 0 1 is moment infinitely divisible mid if for every t 0 the shift with weight sequence t t 0 t 1 is subnormal assume that w is a contraction i e 0 i 1 for all i 0 we show that such a shift w is mid if and only if the sequence is log completely alternating this enables the recapture or improvement of some previous results proved rather differently we derive in particular new conditions sufficient for subnormality of a weighted shift and each example contains implicitly an example or family of infinitely divisible hankel matrices many of which appear to be new 1 introduction let h be a separable complex hilbert space and l h the algebra of bounded linear operators on h an operator t in l h is normal if it commutes with its adjoint t t tt and subnormal if it is unitarily equivalent to the restric tion of a normal operator to an invariant subspace closed linear manifold one standard condition for subnormality is the bram halmos condition bra requir ing non negativity of operator matrices t is subnormal if and only if for each k 1 2 the k 1 k 1 operator matrix t it j 0 i j k is non negative that is t is k hyponormal for each k 1 2 alternatively the agler embry condition agl is that for an operator t which is contractive t 1 t is subnormal if and only if for each n 1 2 one has n i 0 1 i n i t it i 0 that is t is n contractive for each n 1 2 we consider here weighted shifts so let 2 be given its standard basis ej j 0 given a weight sequence 0 1 2 we define the weighted shift w on 2 by w ej jej 1 and extend by linearity the moments are 0 1 and j j 1 i 0 2 i j 1 for virtually all questions of interest it is without loss of generality to assume that the j are positive see shi and we do henceforth the subnormality of unilateral weighted shifts can be characterized in terms of their moments as follows w is subnormal if and only if there exists a borel prob ability measure supported on the interval 0 w 2 such that n tn d t for every n 0 1 this is due to c berger con iii 8 16 and was indepen dently established by r gellar and l j wallen gewa the measure is said to be the berger measure of w on the other hand g exner proved that w is n contractive if and only if n j 0 1 j n j m j 0 m 0 1 ex 1 2010 mathematics subject classification primary 47 b 20 47 b 37 key words and phrases weighted shift subnormal completely monotone sequence

moment characterization the bram halmos conditions yield for a weighted shift the necessary and sufficient condition that the hankel matrices h n k n i j k i j 0 be positive semi definite for all n 0 k 1 cur the aluthge transform has been an object of recent study recall that if t is any operator with t u t its polar decomposition the aluthge transform is defined by at t t 12 u t 12 define the iterated aluthge transform at n by at n 1 t at at n t it is an easy computation that the aluthge transform of a weighted shiftw is a weighted shift with weight sequence 0 1 1 2 closely related to the subnormality of w are the possible subnormalities of the square root shiftw shift 0 1 2 and the aluthge transform of w in fact at w is the schur product of w and its restriction to the subspace of 2 spanned by the basic vectors e 1 e 2 it follows that a sufficient condition for the subnormality of both w and at w is the subnormality of w in cuex the authors studied the connection between the subnormality of w and w and in particular how the associated berger measures and when they exist are linked this leads to the so called square root problem given a probability measure supported on a compact interval in r does there exist satisfying 1 1 tn d t tn d t 2 n 0 1 2 if exists can one find it a related question is given 0 p 1 consider the moment matching equations 1 2 tn d t tn d t p n 0 1 2 one then tries to find one measure given the other finally using the setting of convolution of measures one might ask given a measure as above and a nonnegative integer n can one find a measure such that n ntimes definition 1 1 a unilateral weighted shift w with positive weight sequence 0 1 is moment infinitely divisible mid if for every t 0 the shift with weight sequence t t 0 t 1 is subnormal in this paper we prove that if w is a contraction then it is mid if and only if the sequence is log completely alternating there is a related notion of infinite divisibility concerning divisibility with respect to convolution arising in probability theory in connection with le vy pro cesses see for example sat we use the language moment infinite divisibility mid to avoid confusion with this latter concept it is well known that the schur entry wise product of positive matrices is again positive and from this and the bram halmos condition in its hankel moment matrix formulation for weighted shifts it is immediate that if w is a subnormal shift then for each positive integer m the shift with weight sequence mi is subnormal see cupa for another application of this approach consistent with definition 1 1 a positive matrix aij is called infinitely divisible if for each p 0 the matrix a p ij the schur p th power is again positive see for example bha to a certain extent it is this fact taken with the bram halmos condition moment infinitely divisible weighted shifts 3 which motivates our terminology of moment infinitely divisible weighted shift in what follows observe that when we produce an example of an infinitely divisible weighted shift or family of such shifts we are implicitly producing an infinitely divisible hankel matrix of its moments or family of such matrices and the matrices produced seem not to be in the literature of infinitely divisible matrices we do not comment separately on this below it is an easy computation to realize that raising weights to the t th power is equivalent to raising moments to the t th power and we will say as well that a weight or moment sequence is infinitely divisible with the obvious meaning it is known from ex 2 using an approach based upon completely monotone functions that certain weighted shifts called the agler shifts to be defined below one of which is the familiar bergman shift have this property to describe our main result we need to recall the definition of completely al ternating sequence which in turn requires the definition of completely monotone sequence and we begin in fact with the definition of a completely monotone func tion definition 1 2 a function f r r 0 is completely monotone if its derivatives alternate in sign f 2 j 0 for j 1 and f 2 j 1 0 for j 0 the following statements are well known the function f is completely monotone if and only if f l for some positive measure where l denotes the laplace transform if a completely monotone function f interpolates the moments of a uni lateral weighted shift i e f n n for all n 0 then the shift is subnormal we pause to recall that some well known weighted shifts are mid the agler shifts aj j 1 2 are those with weight sequence n 1 n j n 0 1 these were used in agl as part of a model theory for hypercontractions since a 1 is the unilateral shift its berger measure is 1 for j 2 the berger measure of aj is d t j 1 1 t j 2 dt on 0 1 theorem 1 3 ex 2 for j 2 3 let aj be the j th agler shift any p th power transformation p 0 of aj is subnormal as is any m th iterated aluthge transform of aj the proof which uses monotone function theory offers no information about the berger measure of the resulting shift however it brings to the fore the significance of complete monotonicity in the study of mid shifts to proceed we need to introduce the difference operator acting on sequences 0 n n n 1 k k 1 for all k 1 for example n n n 1 2 n n 2 n 1 n 2 4 chafiq benhida rau l e curto and george r exner 3 n n 3 n 1 3 n 2 n 3 and so on definition 1 4 a sequence is said to be completely monotone if k n 0 for all k n 0 remark 1 5 looking at the agler embry conditions for subnormality we easily see that a contractive shift w is subnormal if and only if n is completely monotone if and only if k n 0 all k n 0 definition 1 6 a sequence is said to be completely alternating if k n 0 for all k 1 n 0 equivalently if the sequence is completely mono tone similarly given an integer k 1 a sequence is said to be k alternating if k n 0 for all n 0 and is k hyperalternating if it is m alternating for all m k the set of completely alternating sequences will be denoted by ca and the subset of sequences in ca with all positive terms will be denoted by ca the set of positive term sequences whose logarithms are in ca will be denoted by expca and the sequences called log completely alternating there is a well known link between completely alternating and completely mono tone sequences which we now state proposition 1 7 bcr prop 6 10 the sequence is completely alternating if and only if the sequence t e t is completely monotone for all t 0 proposition 1 8 bcr chapter 4 prop 6 12 the sequence is completely alternating if and only if it has an associated le vy khintchin measure that is 1 3 n a bn 1 0 1 tn d t where 0 following the usual convention we declare t 0 1 for all t and 1 0 0 d t 0 for any remark 1 9 in the specific case of the agler shifts aj the sequence of weights squared is 1 j 1 0 1 tn j 1 tj 1 dt thus while the lebesgue measure j 1 tj 2 dt helps recover the moments of the agler shift aj the le vy khintchin identity 1 3 with b 0 reproduces the actual weights squared note that in this atypical case the le vy khintchin measure is obtained from the berger measure by multiplying by t and taking a to be the zero th weight completely alternating sequences have been studied extensively but it is impor tant to note that usually there is the assumption that the sequence is positive the study is in the context of semigroups in particular r while here we allow negative terms part of what separates our results from some results of athavale and others in ath shat and atra is this modest change it is easy to check that both ca and ca are closed under sums the addition of constants and positive scalar multiples while exp ca is closed under positive scalar multiplication products and positive powers moment infinitely divisible weighted shifts 5 2 some auxiliary results for later use we record a few auxiliary results proposition 2 1 bcr ch 3 cor 2 10 see also atra cor 1 let ca then ln 1 ca proposition 2 2 atra cor 1 cf bcr ch 3 cor 2 10 let ca then p ca for all 0 p 1 remark 2 3 since n 1 n 2 ca it follows from proposition 2 2 that n 1 n 2 ca we now prove that each positive term completely alternating sequence is auto matically log completely alternating proposition 2 4 the containment ca exp ca holds proof consider first some sequence n in ca all of whose terms are strictly greater than 1 then with n n 1 we get from proposition 2 1 that ln 1 n ln n is in ca which is to say that n is log completely alternating now consider some sequence n in ca since it is completely alternating it is nondecreasing and is in particular bounded away from zero then there exists some k 0 such that k n has all terms strictly greater than one and of course k n is still completely alternating but then k n is log completely alternating by what was just shown and therefore n is log completely alternating as well the reverse containment does not hold recall the agler shifts defined above and that their sequences of weights squared are completely alternating as in remark 1 9 proposition 2 5 we have expca 6 ca proof the sequence n 1 n 2 3 is log completely alternating but not completely al ternating as just noted a 2 the bergman shift with weight sequence n 1 n 2 has weights squared completely alternating therefore the weights squared are log completely alternating so clearly any power of them is log completely alternating but one may check using wol that n 1 n 2 3 is not completely alternating remark 2 6 we now present a link between moments and weights using the dif ference operator recall that n 1 n 2 n all n 0 it follows that ln n 1 ln n ln 2 n or equivalently ln n ln 2 n 0 ln 2 n for all n 0 using mathematical induction one can then prove that 2 1 k 1 ln n kln 2 n for all n 0 it follows that if ln is completely alternating then ln 2 is completely alternating 6 chafiq benhida rau l e curto and george r exner 3 main results the following is the main result of this paper it should be noted that heretofore conditions related to subnormality of shifts have been given on the sequence of moments e g bram halmos and agler embry rather than on the sequence of weights theorem 3 1 let w be a contractive weighted shift with positive weight se quence n then w is moment infinitely divisible mid if and only if 2 n is log completely alternating equivalently n is log completely alternating proof first we recall that a sequence is completely alternating if and only if 3 1 t e t is completely monotone for all t 0 observe also that since w is a contraction so is the shift obtained by raising the weights equivalently the moments to the t th power for any t 0 therefore w is mid if and only if t is completely monotone for all t 0 since t e t ln we can let ln and t t in 3 1 and conclude that w is mid if and only if ln is completely alternating assume that w is mid then ln is completely alternating or equiv alently ln is completely monotone by definition 1 6 then k 1 ln 0 for all k 0 and by 2 1 we have k ln 2 0 for all k 0 we thus have k ln 2 0 for all k 0 that is ln 2 ca the proof of the converse is entirely similar we may recapture two results obtained using interpolation of moments by com pletely monotone functions recall that the weighted shift denoted s a b c d where a b c d 0 and with ad bc has weights an b cn d and that in cpy certain subshifts of such shifts are defined observe as well that if we throw away a finite number of terms at the beginning of a completely alternating or log com pletely alternating sequence what remains is still in the original class therefore some of the results to follow may be generalized easily to restrictions of shifts to the canonical invariant subspaces of finite co dimension which generalizations we leave to the reader corollary 3 2 ex 2 the agler shifts are all moment infinitely divisible as are the contractive shifts s a b c d with a b c d 0 and ad bc and their subshifts proof as noted above the sequence of weights squared for an agler shift is com pletely alternating hence log completely alternating for the second claim we may by scaling reduce to the case a c 1 to consider s 1 s 1 t with t s one computes using induction and the recursion relating differences of length n 1 to differences of length n m 2 n m s t n t n t 1 n t m moment infinitely divisible weighted shifts 7 which is negative since t s the sequences of weights squared is then in ca and hence expca it is easy to check that a subshift of some s a b c d is merely some s a b c d satisfying the needed conditions the desired result then follows we now have the following consequences which seem difficult to obtain in other ways recall that for a weighted shift which is subnormal even hyponormal the weight sequence is nondecreasing and w supn n corollary 3 3 suppose w is a contractive weighted shift i if w is mid let w be some perturbation consisting only of decreasing the zeroth weight of w while leaving it positive then w is mid ii if the weighted shift with weight sequence e e w e 0 e w e 1 e w is mid then w is mid proof for the first claim a reduction in the first weight does not destroy log completely alternating the second claim is immediate from proposition 2 4 and theorem 3 1 observe that for the conclusion in ii we could assume instead that the weight sequence e e 0 e 1 is completely alternating we may improve in some ways the result of colo lemma p 217 which proves subnormality for a certain weighted shift of importance in considering toeplitz operators existence of non normal non analytic subnormal toeplitz operators corollary 3 4 if 0 p 1 the weighted shift with weights n 1 p 2 n 2 1 2 for n 0 1 is subnormal and moment infinitely divisible further if p 1 p 2 pk is a collection of values in 0 1 the weighted shift with weights n k i 1 1 p 2 n 2 i 1 2 for n 0 1 is subnormal and mid proof for the first claim it is clear that the weight sequence squared is generated as 1 0 1 tn 1 d p 2 t by the measure p 2 where x is the dirac mass at x and is therefore completely alternating the second claim follows easily from the first using schur products here is an example for which moment infinite divisibility and subnormality are easy from this point of view but seem difficult from approaches based upon the moments it is based on an example in bcr ex 6 24 p 139 example 3 5 the weighted shift with weights the sequence n defined by n 1 1 2 1 3 1 n 1 ln n 2 n 0 1 or the shift with weights the square roots of these is mid and subnormal this is because this sequence is completely alternating and it increases to the euler constant 0 577 using the definition of moment infinitely divisible and schur products one may show that if w is mid then so is at w but we may also prove this as follows in part because it provides a local version of a result to come later corollary 3 6 if a contractive weighted shift w is moment infinitely divisible then so is at w proof since ln n is completely alternating clearly so is ln n n 1 8 chafiq benhida rau l e curto and george r exner for 0 t 1 2 consider now the generalized mean transform of a linear operator t defined as t t 1 2 t t t 1 t where t t t tu t 1 t is the generalized aluthge transform of t when t 0 this is the mean transform already considered in lly for a weighted shift w w t turns out to be another weighted shift with weight sequence 1 t n t n 1 t n 1 t n 1 2 n 0 in lly the authors conjecture that the mean transform of the bergman shift is subnormal and prove that the mean transform of the schur square of the bergman shift that is the shift with weights the squares of those of the bergman shift is subnormal both of these results are obtained as corollaries of the following proposition 3 7 supposew is a contractive weighted shift whose weights squared are completely alternating then both the weighted shift whose weights are n 2 n 2 n 1 2 and the generalized mean transform of w are contractive and mid and hence subnormal if the weights of w are completely alternating then the generalized mean transform of w is contractive and mid and hence subnormal proof suppose that w is a contractive weighted shift whose weights squared are completely alternating it is then clear that the two resulting shifts considered are contractions the squares of the n clearly form a completely alternating and hence log completely alternating sequence as well since the weights squared of w are completely alternating using the result for p th roots for p 1 so is the sequence of their square roots that is the weight sequence for w and therefore so is the weight sequence for the generalized mean transform of w the second claim follows by the argument just used applied directly to the weight sequence for w corollary 3 8 the mean transform of the bergman shift and the mean transform of the schur square of the bergman shift are both moment infinitely divisible and hence subnormal it is clear that small modifications of the aluthge and mean transforms an av erage of three weights for example will yield similar results and also that iterated aluthge and mean transforms will yield the same conclusions we consider next the cesa ro transform of a sequence recall that given a sequence xn its cesa ro transform is the sequence whose n th term is cn x 0 x 1 xn n 1 we define as well the geometric cesa ro transform as the one whose n th term is gn n 1 x 0 x 1 xn given a sequence xn we will occasionally write c xn for its cesa ro transform and gc xn for its geometric cesa ro transform in some sense the mean and aluthge transforms are for weighted shifts local versions of these we have the following proposition 3 9 if the sequence xn is completely alternating then its cesa ro transform c xn is completely alternating if the sequence xn is log completely alternating its geometric cesa ro transform gc xn is log completely alternating moment infinitely divisible weighted shifts 9 proof the second assertion follows easily from the first for the first let d m j denote the difference of orderm for the original sequence xn beginning at position j d m j m i 0 1 i m i xj i m 1 2 j 0 1 observe that since the original sequence is completely alternating each of these is non positive similarly let c m j denote the differences for the cesa ro transform c m j m i 0 1 i m i cj i m 1 2 j 0 1 one may show by induction and using the recursive relationships d m 1 j d m j d m j 1 their c m j equivalents and some elementary relationships among binomial coefficients that c m j m j m j 1 j k 0 m k m d m k and therefore that the c m j are non positive as required we leave to the interested reader the proof of the analogous stability results for the sequences defined by c k n xn xn 1 xn k k 1 and gkn k 1 xn xn 1 xn k for a fixed integer k 1 we have the following corollaries of proposition 3 9 corollary 3 10 if w is a contractive weighted shift whose weights squared are completely alternating then both the shift with weights n c 2 n and the shift with weights c n have completely alternating weights are contractive and are thus mid and subnormal if w is a contractive weighted shift whose weights squared are log completely alternating equivalently its weights are log completely alternating then the weighted shift wgc n has weights log completely alternating and is thus mid and subnormal proof all is straightforward keeping in mind that if a sequence is completely alternating so are its p th power sequences for p 1 let z denote the classical gamma function with its derivative and let denote the euler constant 577 corollary 3 11 the weighted shift with weight sequence given by n 2 n 3 n 3 n n 1 n 0 1 and as well the weighted shift with weight sequence given by the 2 n are each moment infinitely divisible and hence subnormal proof the 2 n sequence is the cesa ro transform of the weights squared sequence for the bergman shift as is shown by a computation 10 chafiq benhida rau l e curto and george r exner we remark that there are similar results obtainable by the cesa ro transform of the other agler shifts note that in the following two propositions the exponent n 1 ensures that a sequence has zeroth term 1 as is required for a shift moment sequence proposition 3 12 if n is a positive completely monotone sequence with 0 1 then so is e n 1 and therefore the shift with these moments is subnormal proof consider some one of the expressions to be tested for m monotonicity that is some one of the m n expand using the customary power series for ex and use that the set of completely monotone sequences is closed under the taking of positive integer powers similarly we obtain proposition 3 13 if n is a positive infinitely divisible sequence with 0 1 then so is e n 1 and so the shift with these moments is moment infinitely divisible we record the following easy observation in part because it leads to an open question cf subsection 5 2 corollary 3 14 suppose n is a positive bounded completely alternating se quence and let m sup n then the shift with weights e n em is moment infinitely divisible proof the weights of the new contractive shift are obviously log completely al ternating 4 complete hyperexpansivity and moment infinite divisibility we recall that a completely hyperexpansive weighted shift with weight sequence n n 0 gives rise to a subnormal weighted shift by forming a new weight sequence where n 1 n for all n further one cannot necessarily begin with a subnormal shift and by taking reciprocals of the weights generate a completely hyperexpan sive shift see the discussion after ath proposition 6 the following sheds some but not complete light on this result corollary 4 1 let w be a completely hyperexpansive weighted shift with positive weight sequence n n 0 then the weighted shift with weight sequence 1 n n 0 is not only subnormal but moment infinitely divisible proof let n be the moment sequence for w since w is completely hyperex pansive the sequence n is completely alternating it is therefore log completely alternating by a computation similar to what was done earlier one shows that the sequence 2 n or equivalently n is what should naturally be called log com pletely monotone it also results that each of the n must satisfy n 1 which is not surprising sincew is an expansion a proof of this is elementary using the standard recurrence relationship for difference sequences it then follows easily that the sequence 1 2 n equivalently 1 n is log completely alternating and that each term is no larger than 1 and that therefore the reciprocal shift is infinitely divisible and therefore of course subnormal moment infinitely divisible weighted shifts 11 note that infinite divisibility of a subnormal shift is a necessary condition for its reciprocal shift to be completely hyperexpansive but it is not sufficient as shown by athavale s example in the discussion cited above this is just the third agler shift which we know is infinitely divisible thus there is some proper subset of the completely alternating sequences which has some stronger property see the condition in ath proposition 6 which is another for all t type condition weights in expca is sufficient for infinite divisibility of the shift but we do not know what more the weights in the more restrictive class ca tells you about the shift itself nor do we know what even more the weights in this yet more restrictive athavale class tells you about the shift itself observe in passing that there is no hope of something like infinite divisibility for completely hyperexpansive shifts recall that the weights of a completely hyperexpansive shift are larger than 1 except in the trivial case of the unilateral shift and the condition for 2 expansivity includes 1 2 20 20 21 0 clearly if we change this to 1 2 2 p 0 2 p 0 2 p 1 0 there is no hope of it being satisfied for all p 0 we know the set of p for which it is satisfied includes 0 1 it still makes sense to ask what that set of p is and in particular if it is connected just as the similar question for a subnormal operator not infinitely divisible makes good sense 5 concluding remarks and open questions we close with some remarks and questions 1 notice that the sequences n 1 n 2 2 n 1 n 2 3 n 1 n 2 4 are not completely alternating now if for a moment we think of completely al ternating sequences as interpolated by bernstein functions see bcr the faa di bruno formulae com section 3 4 theorem a p 137 shows that powers of the bernstein functions are not necessarily bernstein functions and this suggests that powers of completely alternating sequences are not necessarily completely alternating in fact the sequence n 1 n 2 2 is 8 alternating but not 9 alternating the sequence n 1 n 2 3 is 3 alternating but not 4 alternating the sequence n 1 n 2 4 is 2 alternating but not 3 alternating and the sequence n 1 n 2 5 is not even 2 alternating 2 consider now the weight sequence n 1 n 2 i e the bergman weights squared since this is completely alternating it is obvious that the weight sequence e n 1 n 2 is log completely alternating and therefore the shift with weights e n 1 n 2 1 is mid however there is evidence from wol that this sec ond weight sequence is actually completely alternating and not merely log completely alternating is this true one may expand the expo nential in a power series as in the proof of proposition 3 12 but since the powers of weights are greater than one in that series not less than one 12 chafiq benhida rau l e curto and george r exner we may not cite the usual fact about p th roots for completely alternating sequences to handle terms of degree 2 or higher in fact such sequences are not completely alternating as shown in item 1 above is the result true nonetheless we remark that the weight sequence ee n 1 n 2 is not completely alternating and it is log completely alternating precisely if the one considered just above is completely alternating 3 we know that if the weights of w are completely alternating they are log completely alternating and so the shift is mid but we do not know what extra results from being not only in expca but in the more restrictive class ca 4 there is another approach to showing that a weighted shift is subnormal using berger measures recall that every subnormal weighted shift w has an associated berger measure a probability measure supported on 0 w 2 and satisfying n w 2 0 tnd t n 0 1 further if there exists such a measure matching the moments ofw then the shift is subnormal in colo the proof of subnormality of the shift referenced in corollary 3 4 is by providing the berger measure it is a countably atomic measure with point masses at as might be expected pk for k 0 1 2 and in cuid the berger measures are provided for the shifts s a b c d the berger measures for the agler shifts and a handful of other examples are also known it is a theme of cuex that finding such measures may be difficult in that paper it is obtained using the laplace transform that the berger measure of the weighted shift whose moment sequence is q 1 n 1 n 1 is 1 q lnu q 1 du this latter result is the only one of which we are aware in which the full family of berger measures associated with a mid weighted shift here the bergman shift is known and our characterization of the mid weighted shifts points to this new and probably difficult line of investigation acknowledgment the authors wish to express their gratitude to
