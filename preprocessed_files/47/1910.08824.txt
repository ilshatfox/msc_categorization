the canonical polar decomposition of t we let t t 1 2 v t 1 2 denote the aluthge transform of t 1 it is well known that t is invertible if and only if t is invertible moreover the spectra of t and t are equal over the last two decades considerable attention has been given to the study of the aluthge transform cf 2 5 11 16 29 33 39 42 moreover the aluthge transform has been generalized to the case of powers of t different from 1 2 6 7 10 30 and to the case of commuting pairs of operators 16 17 2000 mathematics subject classification primary 47 b 20 47 b 37 47 a 13 28 a 50 secondary 44 a 60 47

we focus on the spherical aluthge transform 17 although our results hold for arbitrary n 2 for the reader s convenience we will focus on the case n 2 that is the case of commuting pairs of hilbert space operators let t t 1 t 2 be a commuting pair of operators on h we now consider the canonical polar decomposition of the column operator t 1 t 2 that is t 1 t 2 v 1 v 2 p where p t 1 t 1 t 2 t 2 and v 1 v 2 is a joint partial isometry and subject to the constraint 2 i 1 ker ti 2 i 1 kervi kerp the spherical aluthge transform of t is the necessarily commuting n tuple t pv 1 p pvn p 16 17 1 1 for a commuting pair t t 1 t 2 of operators on h the koszul complex associated with t is given as k t h 0 0 h t 1 t 2 h h t 2 t 1 h 0 0 definition 1 1 a commuting pair t is said to be taylor invertible if its associated koszul complex k t h is exact the taylor spectrum of t is t t 1 2 c 2 k t 1 1 t 2 2 h is not invertible the pair t is called fredholm if each map in the koszul complex k t h has closed range and all the homology quotients are finite dimensional the taylor essential spectrum is te t 1 2 c 2 t 1 1 t 2 2 is not fredholm j l taylor showed in 36 and 37 that if h 6 0 then t t is a nonempty compact subset of the polydisc of multiradius r t r t 1 r t 2 where r ti is the spectral radius of ti i 1 2 for additional facts about these joint spectra the reader is referred to 12 15 and 38 as shown in 13 and 14 the fredholmness of t can be detected in the calkin algebra q h b h k h here k denotes the closed two sided ideal of compact operators we also let b h q h denote the quotient map concretely t is fredholm on h if and only if the pair of left multiplication operators l t l t 1 l t 2 is taylor invertible when acting on q h in particular t is left fredholm on h if and only if l t is bounded below on q h problem 1 2 let t t 1 t 2 be a commuting pair of operators i assume that t be taylor invertible resp fredholm is t also taylor invertible resp fredholm ii is the taylor spectrum resp taylor essential spectrum of t equal to that of t we first prove that t t t t we do this in two stages away from the origin we use tools and techniques from criss cross commutativity at the origin we show that the left invertibility of t or t implies the invertibility of p p then helps establish an isomorphism between the relevant koszul complexes as a consequence we can readily extend the above result to other spectral systems that rely on the koszul complex for their definition including spectral systems on q h 2 main results recall the joint polar decomposition of t and the spherical aluthge transform of t cf 1 1 we now state our first main result 2 theorem 2 1 assume that t or t is left invertible that is the associated koszul complex is exact at the left stage and the range of the corresponding boundary map is closed then the operator p is invertible proof case 1 if t is left invertible then t 1 t 1 t 2 t 2 is invertible and therefore p is invertible case 2 if t is left invertible then it is bounded below that is there exists a constant c 0 such that pv 1 px 2 pv 2 px 2 c 2 x 2 since v 1 v 2 is a joint partial isometry it readily follows that px 2 px 2 c 2 p x 2 as a result p is bounded below so p is invertible we are now ready to state our second main result theorem 2 2 let t t 1 t 2 be a commuting pair of operators on h then t is taylor invertible t is taylor invertible we now recall the notion of criss cross commutativity definition 2 3 let a a 1 an and b b 1 bn be two n tuples of operators on h we say that a and b criss cross commute or that a criss cross commutes with b if aibjak akbjai and biajbk bkajbi for all i j k 1 n observe that we do not assume that a or b is commuting definition 2 4 given two n tuples a and b we define ab a 1 b 1 anbn and ba b 1 a 1 bnan remark 2 5 it is an easy consequence of definition 2 3 that if a and b criss cross commute and ab is commuting then ba is also commuting lemma 2 6 let t t 1 t 2 be a commuting pair of operators on h let p t 1 t 1 t 2 t 2 and let t be its spherical aluthge transform then a a 1 a 2 p p and b b 1 b 2 v 1 p v 2 p criss cross commute as a consequence t ba is commuting lemma 2 7 cf 8 and 9 let a criss cross commute with b on h and assume that ab is commuting then t ba 0 t ab 0 we now prove our third main result theorem 2 8 let t t 1 t 2 be a commuting pair of operators on h then t t t t proof let c 2 if 0 0 use theorem 2 2 if 6 0 0 use lemma 2 7 remark 2 9 i theorems 2 1 2 2 and 2 8 can be easily extended to other spectral systems whose definition is given in terms of the koszul complex e g the left k spectral systems k defined by w s lodkowski and w z elazko 34 35 for the proof of theorem 2 1 which uses only left invertibility of the relevant koszul complex works well in case t or t once we know that p is invertible the koszul complexes of t and t are isomorphic so 0 k t if and only if 0 k t ii similarly theorem 2 7 admits an easy extension to s lodkowski s left k spectra cf 8 9 3 since the proof of theorem 2 7 relies on the isomorphism of the koszul complexes for t and t implemented by p iii on the other hand the above results cannot be extended to s lodkowski s right k spectra for consider the adjoint u of the unweighted unilateral shift u it is easy to see that u is onto while u is not our final main result deals with fredholmness theorem 2 10 let t t 1 t 2 be a commuting pair of operators on h then te t te t moreover for each te t we have ind t ind t where ind denotes the fredholm index sketch of proof in theorem 2 1 one can replace left invertible for the koszul complex with left fredholm and invertible for p with fredholm a similar adjustment works for theorems 2 2 and 2 8 in the analog of theorem 2 2 one first proves that p is bounded below in the orthogonal complement of kert 1 ker t 2 since this kernel is finite dimensional it follows that p is fredholm in theorem 2 8 one needs to replace lemma 2 7 with the results for fredholmness proved in 8 9 31 and 32 while li s results only guarantee that ind t ind t whenever 6 0 0 the continuity of the fredholm index cf 13 does the rest references 1 a
