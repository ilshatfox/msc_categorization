decision making and productivity measurement decision making and productivity measurement dariush khezrimotlagh department of statistics miami university ohio usa abstract in this article the concepts of technical efficiency efficiency effectiveness and productivity are illustrated it is discussed that when firms are not ho mogenous the situation is the same as when each factor has a different unit of measurement from one firm to another and therefore no meaningful discrimination can be expressed unless a set of known weights are intro duced to standardize data a linear programming dea model is used when a set of known weights are given to calculate the technical efficiency and efficiency of a set of homogenous dmus with multiple input factors and output factors a numerical example is also provided keywords dea technical efficiency ranking noncontrollable factor 1 0 introduction a non parametric technique to estimate the technical efficiency and the efficiency of a set of homogenous firms was proposed by farrell 1957 his method estimates the production function non parametrically which was similarly suggested by debreu 1951 and koopmans 1951 f rsund and hjalmarsson 1974 illustrated the notion of efficiency in the macro the industry and the micro levels and clearly displayed and demonstrated the differences between the production frontier and efficiency soon after charnes et al 1978 proposed a mathematical construction and a linear programming model to introduce technically efficient firms with multiple input factors and multiple output factors they called the mathematical construction data envelopment analysis dea and the model charnes cooper and rhodes ccr ccr generates a pps based upon a set of available homogenous firms and non parametrically and linearly estimates the production function thus the firms which lie on the frontier of that pps are called technically efficient ccr fails to measure the technical in efficiency completely and only calculate the output view of technical effi ciency that is increasing the values of output factors without measuring the excess of input factors or calculate only the input view of technical ef ficiency that is decreasing the values of input factors without measuring the shortage of output factors for this reason f re and lovell 1978 noted on farrell s measurement of technical efficiency and ccr and pro posed a russell measure to simultaneously deal with both input and output views of technical efficiency their proposed model is a non linear pro gramming and difficult to solve thus pastor et al 1999 proposed en hanced russell measure erm to measure technical efficiency of firms and avoid computational and interpretative difficulties with the russell measure on the other hand charnes et al 1985 proposed an additive model add to remove the shortcomings of ccr to measure the technical inef ficiency of firms nonetheless add is also not a perfect model to measure the technical inefficiency therefore tone 1997 2001 proposed a slack based measure sbm model to measure technical inefficiency of firms he proved that 1 erm and sbm are equivalent in that the lambda s val ues that are optimal for one are also optimal for the other 2 the sbm measurement corresponds to the mean proportional rate of input factors reduction and the mean proportional rate of output factors expansion 3 the sbm measurement is monotone decreasing in each input and output slack and 4 it is invariant with respect to the unit of measurement of each input and output item all proposed models such as ccr add and sbm are provided to measure the technical inefficiency which neither provides a ranking and benchmarking tool nor introduces the relative efficiency scores for firms note that there are a lot of proposed models based on ccr in the literature of operations research since 1978 which have the same or more men tioned shortcomings to focus on technical efficiency doing the job right instead of efficiency doing the job well to discriminate a set of homoge nous firms while these studies not be further upon here but readers can examine several of these questionable studies and criticize their lack of discrimination and ranking tools as simple exercises sexton et al 1986 wisely noted the shortcomings of ccr and stated that dea cannot be used to analyze or comment on a firm s price effi ciency and a firm can be technically efficient but price inefficient thus they proposed a cross efficiency model which was supposed to measure the score that a particular firm receives when it is rated by another firm nonetheless the cross efficiency score for a firm is also not a relative score for that firm it is an average value of the relative scores of that firm according to some specified sets of weights which neither should be used to rank firms nor is relatively meaningful the average values of the rela tive scores of firms like the maximum minimum first quartile and so on values of the relative scores are not relatively meaningful and should not be suggested as the relative scores of firms in order to decrease the above shortcomings khezrimotlagh et al 2013 proposed a method called kam to bridge the gaps between technical efficiency and efficiency the score of kam is different from the scores of other models in the literature and can be used as a fair judgment tool for ranking and benchmarking firms when the value of epsilon is 0 the results of 0 kam identify the firms which are technically efficient and technically inefficient and should not be used to rank or benchmark firms as the value of epsilon increases the results of kam can be used to rank and benchmark firms according to the value of epsilon and the introduced assumptions for weights prices of input and output factors the technical efficiency as well as production function depends upon the way of introducing the practical points and the efficiency depends upon the weights worth prices of the factors and at least require the combina tion of the radiate the convexity and the wholly dominant approaches to linearly estimate the efficiency scores of a set of homogenous firms in the next sections after introducing several phrases kam is used to measure the efficiency of firms with the least requirements to the radiate the con vexity and the wholly dominant approaches 2 0 introduced phrases the purpose of discrimination for a set of homogenous firms factories organization divisions and so on in which each firm has multiple input factors and multiple output factors is to find the firms which have lesser values of the input factors and greater values of the output factors for such an aim the ratio of a linear combination of the output factors to a lin ear combination of the input factors is introduced as the measure for the purpose of discrimination therefore the weight price worth of each factor is required to introduce the linear combination of the factors and allow measuring the performances of the firms since the firms are homogenous the weight price worth of each factor should not be varied from one firm to another unless all differences known and multiplied to the values of the factors before the evaluation the concepts of doing the job right doing the job well doing the useful job and so on were similarly introduced in the literature of eco nomics and operations research but differently interpreted with several words and phrases such as efficiency technical efficiency price efficien cy productive efficiency relative efficiency economic efficiency alloca tive efficiency overall efficiency productivity and so on philosophically we should avoid using several phrases for a concept and should cautiously clarify whether the relationship between that con cept and what we express is meaningful for instance the word efficien cy is commonly used instead of the phrases technical efficiency and relative efficiency if these phrases illustrate the same concept the word efficiency should be enough to mention that concept and any further ter minology is redundant and misleading the same criticism can be illustrated for the phrases price efficiency overall efficiency productive efficiency and so on according to the cambridge english dictionary the word efficiency means the condition or fact of producing the results you want without waste or a particular way in which this is done the phrase technical effi ciency means a situation in which a company or a particular machine produces the largest possible number of goods with the time materials la bor etc that are available and the word relative means as judged or measured in comparison with something else even from the literal defi nition we can see the terms are clearly different in meaning therefore it is vital to review the meaning of these phrases in the literature of econom ics engineering and operations research and reintroduce them with indus try wide accuracy and understanding 2 1 the technical efficiency measurement suppose that there are several homogenous firms which each firm uses a set of input factors to produce a set of output factors in the literature of the production theory a production possibility set pps is a set of all possible situations which a set of output factors can be produced from a set of input factors a production function production frontier is also a func tion that gives the maximum possible values of the output factors from the values of the input factors the points on the production function are called the technically efficient points and this definition is matched to the literal definition as well none of the coordinates of the technically efficient points can be improved without worsening another coordinate that is none of the values of the input output factors can be decreased increased without increasing the value of another input factor or decreasing the value of another output factor a point which is in the pps and does not lie on the production function is called technically inefficient when a point is technically inefficient at least one of its input or output factors can be im proved to reach the production function in order to be technically efficient in other words a technical inefficient point is dominated by one technical efficient point at least the following figure depicts the production function for a set of six firms labeled a f which each firm has two input factors to produce a sin gle constant output factor as well as the related pps and the technically ef ficient and inefficient firms the horizontal axis in the figure represents the values of the first input factor per unit of the output factor and the vertical axis represents the val ues of the second input factor per unit of the output factor the curve in the figure is called the production function and the above area of the curve is the related pps the firms a d which lie on the production function are technically ef ficient and the firms e and f which are inside the pps are technically in efficient firms a c wholly dominate e for instance e and c used the same value of the first input factor but e used the greater value of the sec ond input factor and for this reason e is technically inefficient in other words the points which are inside the pps can be compared with at least one point which is on the frontier of the pps in the figure figure 1 a pps of a set of six firms the pps is the practical region the production function is the frontier of the feasible area and the technically efficient points are the points which have done the job right in other words the concept of doing the job right is the same as the concept of technical efficiency and the word tech nical refers to the used technology approach to introduce the practical points when a firm has done the job right it means that the firm has produced the maximum possible values of the output factors from a set of the input factors in addition the concept of doing the job right depends upon the in troduced approach to generate the practical points and this is the same as the concept of technical efficiency which depends upon the use of technol ogy to define the production function the concept of doing the job right is only a necessary condition to dis criminate between firms and is not enough to introduce the firms which have done the job well for instance both firms a and d have done the job right in the above figure however if it is supposed that they have done the job well at the same time a paradox is generated if a firm lies on the pro duction function it does not logically say that the firm has done the job well it is possible that a firm which does not lie on the production function has done the job better than the firm which lies on the production function in other words the discrimination between firms based on the production function only even if the production function is exactly available is not valid the important pros of technical efficiency are to estimate the pro duction function and find the firms which can be candidates for the con cept of doing the job well without introducing the firm which has done the job well a firm which has done the job well in comparison with all other firms is technically efficient and lies on the production function but the points on the production function which are technically efficient have not necessarily done the job well 2 2 efficiency measurement let s suppose that the line has the same slope as the ratio of the prices weights worth of the two input factors as depicted in figure 2 from the figure d has done the job well in comparison with all other firms thus the firms can be arranged from the highest rank to the lowest rank given by d c b a f and e respectively point p is not practical according to the pps but has the same worth as d s performance and al lows discrimination between e and d e can increase the value of the first input factor and decrease the value of the second output factor to perform as well as d within the pps figure 2 the price overall relative allocative economic efficiency of e from the literature of economics the ratio of is called the technical efficiency of e the ratio of is called the price efficiency of b or the allocative efficiency of e and the ratio of is called the ratio of the overall efficiency of e or the economic efficiency of e all of these ratios are less than equal to 1 as can be seen the overall efficiency of e has exactly the same mean ing as the price efficiency of e which can also be measured by multiplying the technical efficiency of e and the allocative efficiency of e that is therefore at least two of phrases price efficiency overall efficiency or economic efficiency are redun dant the concept of allocative efficiency also does not provide a ranking tool similar to the concept of technical efficiency and just describes the non technical efficiency hence there is no reason to use a new phrase in deed the price inefficiency of e can be decomposed by the technical ineffi ciency of e and the non technical inefficiency of e thus we should avoid using extra and superfluous phrases from these definitions the price overall economic efficiency of d is 1 and the price efficiency of the other firms is always less than equal to 1 thus the meaning of the price overall economic efficiency can also be in terpreted as the relative efficiency the equation 1 1 2 2 has the same value for every point 1 2 on the line and is equal to 1 1 2 2 where 1 and 2 are the corresponded pric es weights worth of the first input factor and the second input factor re spectively as figure 3 illustrates the price overall economic efficiency of e is equal with the ratio of 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 which is equal to 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 indeed the lines and are parallel and the ratio of is equal to the ratio of in the triangle hence the linear combination of the input factors of every point of the pps is compared with the linear combination of d s input factors thus the provided score is relatively meaningful and the price overall economic efficiency of e can be introduced as the rela tive efficiency of e as well this outcome precisely defines the concept of doing the job well and can be expressed in one word efficiency which is the condition or fact of producing the results that we would want without waste figure 3 the concept of doing the job well note that in the literature of operations research relative efficiency is usually considered as technical efficiency which is incorrect in defini tion of technical efficiency no suitable discrimination between the points on the production function is introduced the provided ratio for the tech nical efficiency such as is a fake relative score and does not yield a valid comparison between e and other points in the pps in fact the pros and cons of the technical efficiency are the same as that of doing the job right and the provided score for the concept of doing the job right is not relatively meaningful since the concept of doing the job well depends on the weights prices worth of the factors and requires the concepts of the wholly dominant the convexity and the radiate approaches to discriminate the firms linearly the efficiency also depends on the weights prices worth of the factors and at least requires the concepts of the wholly dominant the convexity and the radiate approaches to discriminate the firms linearly in the literature of economics and operations research the wholly dom inant approach is called free disposal hull fdh technology the combi nation of the wholly dominant and the convexity approaches is called var iable returns to scale vrs technology and the combination of the wholly dominant the convexity and the radiate approaches is called con stant returns to scale crs technology as table 1 illustrates the tech nical efficiency doing the job right depends on the fdh vrs or crs technologies and does not provide discrimination between firms but the efficiency doing the job well depends on the relationships between the factors and at least requires the crs technical efficiency to discriminate firms linearly when a firm is not efficient it is inefficient if one desires to decom pose the inefficiency of a firm inefficiency can be decomposed by the crs technical inefficiency and the non crs technical inefficiency the crs technical inefficiency can also be decomposed by vrs technical inef ficiency and non vrs technical inefficiency and so on this topic is dis cussed in the upcoming sections in short the meaning of crs technical efficiency should not be misin terpreted as efficiency similar to the concept of doing the job right which should not be misinterpreted with the concept of doing the job well if us ing 200 at most yields 200 and 220 yields 700 the point 220 700 is more efficient than the point 200 200 and this is our suitable choice re gardless of whether we are applying vrs fdh or any other approaches to define the production function in other words when our purpose is to rank a set of homogenous firms at least crs technical efficiency should be measured of course after finding the best firm and measure the concept of partially dominant the exact returns to scale is required to estimate the production function from here forward instead of the phrase crs tech nical efficiency the phrase technical efficiency will be exclusively used 2 3 the productivity measurement the concept of doing the job well is also introduced as productivity in the literature of economics there is no problem if one desires to call do ing the job well as productivity and one can use the pair technical effi ciency and productivity instead of the pair technical efficiency and effi ciency nonetheless after measuring the concept of doing the job well there is still a need to measure whether the outcomes satisfy the goals of firms indeed the concept of doing the well job is different from the con cept of doing the job well and requires another meaningful name according to cambridge english dictionary the ability to be success ful and produce the intended results is called effectiveness therefore effectiveness can be used for the concept of doing the well job and productivity can be used for the concept of doing the useful job which is a combination of both efficiency and effectiveness the word produc tivity means the rate at which a person company or country does useful work according to cambridge english dictionary therefore it is sug gested that the commonly utilized phrases and concepts be reestablished according to the following table table 1 reestablishing the concepts phrases the concept approach reestablishing doing the job right technical efficiency doing the job well efficiency doing the right job technical effectiveness doing the well job effectiveness doing the useful job productivity the wholly dominant approach free disposal hull the wholly dominant and convexity approaches variable returns to scale the wholly dominant convexity and radiate approaches constant returns to scale the wholly dominant convexity and inner radiate approaches decreasing returns to scale the wholly dominant convexity and outer radiate approaches increasing returns to scale to clearly explain the above let s suppose that a set of 9 homogenous banks labeled a i are selected assume that the aim of discrimination is 1 to find the banks which have used a smaller number of tellers to service a greater number of customers and 2 to find the banks which have at least serviced 1 number of customers in the period of evaluation suppose that the production function is available and the location of each bank in the cartesian coordinate plane is depicted in figure 4 the blue curve represents the production function the horizontal axis illustrates the number of tellers and the vertical axis displays the number of customers the banks a g lie on the production function and are vrs technically efficient and the banks h and i are vrs technically ineffi cient figure 4 the production function by considering the ratio of the number of customers to the number of tellers d is the most efficient bank followed by e h and f respectively h is not technically efficient but for instance h is more efficient than a which is vrs technically efficient figure 5 the productivity measurement the banks c d e f g and h have at least serviced 1 number of cus tomers and are effective f is the most effective bank followed by g e and h therefore the banks c d e f and h are the most productive banks which are most efficient and most effective at the same time in comparison with other banks the above results can also be seen in figure 5 where the horizontal ax is displays the relative efficiency of each bank and the vertical axis repre sents the relative effectiveness of each bank as can be seen d has the rel ative score equal to 1 and f has the relative effectiveness equal to 1 the red area illustrates the non productive banks which are the banks a b and i and have relative effectiveness scores less than that of c and relative ef ficiency scores less than 0 8 g is the most effective bank after f but has the relative efficiency score less than 0 8 the dark and light green area represents the productive banks which have relative efficiency scores more than 0 8 and relative ef fectiveness scores more than that of c if the goal of evaluation which is at least servicing 1 number of cus tomers in period of evaluation is changed to at least servicing 2 number of customers as figures 4 and 5 illustrate even the most efficient banks d and c are not called productive due to the lack of their effectiveness in this case the banks e f and h are the most productive banks among the banks a i as the dark green area displays in figure 5 the concept of effectiveness is always required in real life applications for instance no bank desires to decrease consumer satisfaction and no firm works without a plan or some requirements it is also possible that each bank has different goals for effectiveness index for instance a bank may only prefer the production function values according to its set of input fac tors and in this case if a different goal for each bank does not affect the homogeneity of the banks the technical effectiveness index can also be calculated in short there are several concepts which provide the most important indexes to discriminate the performance of homogenous firms the con cept of doing the job right which is called technical efficiency is not enough to discriminate between firms the technical efficiency is usually interpreted as efficiency in the literature and if one would like to use such a term for the concept of doing the job right one should be aware that such efficiency is neither enough to discriminate between firms nor should the corresponded index be used to rank and benchmark the firms in order to rank and benchmark a set of homogenous firms the concept of doing the job well is required and this concept is called efficiency the efficiency is usually interpreted as productivity in the literature of economics and simi larly if one would like to use the word productivity for the concept of do ing the job well one should know that there is still a need to measure the effectiveness of firms therefore table 1 is provided to reintroduce the concepts of efficiency effectiveness and productivity with industry wide accuracy and understanding 3 0 the epsilon kam suppose that there are firms labeled 1 2 and each firm has input factors with the values 1 2 and output fac tors with the values 1 2 assume that the weights prices or the approximation of the relationships between input and output factors are and for 1 2 and 1 2 respectively suppose that and are defined as equation 1 for 1 2 and 1 2 1 1 1 assume that the epsilon vector with bolded notation is given by 1 2 1 2 to introduce an epsilon neighborhood of firm 1 2 the components of epsilon vector are introduced by equation 2 for 1 2 and 1 2 and 2 the value of epsilon has the same meaning for each factor when equa tion 2 is considered the components of epsilon vector can be defined by equation 3 where 0 for 1 2 and 1 2 and 3 there are a lot of ways to introduce the components of epsilon vector according to the aim of discrimination for instance and can be in troduced as equation 4 for 1 2 and 1 2 in this case the components of epsilon vector are commensurate with the corresponded input and output factors but are not changed from one firm to another ave 1 and ave 1 4 it is also possible to introduce one or more of the components of epsi lon vector as 0 regarding the purpose of discrimination for example the components of epsilon can be introduced by and 0 for 1 2 and 1 2 which let s consider the errors in input factors only equation 5 illustrates the kam when the performance of is meas ured 1 2 min 1 1 subject to 1 for 1 2 1 for 1 2 0 for 1 2 0 for 1 2 0 for 1 2 5 the kam can linearly be solved by equation 6 min 1 subject to 1 1 1 for 1 2 1 for 1 2 0 for 1 2 0 for 1 2 0 for 1 2 0 6 the score of kam represents that the efficiency score of firm that is 1 1 is compared with the efficiency score of a point on the estimated production function that is 1 1 such that the ratio of 1 1 to 1 1 be comes minimum since the efficiency of firm is a constant value kam finds a point on the estimated production function which has an equal or greater efficiency score in comparison with that of firm regarding the value of epsilon and introduced and the target for firm 1 2 which lies on the estimated pro duction function and has a greater or equal ratio of the linear combina tion of output factors to the linear combination of input factors regarding the value of epsilon and introduced and is given by for 1 2 for 1 2 7 the dual linear programming is also given by equation 8 max 1 1 p k 1 1 1 1 0 for 1 2 for 1 2 for 1 2 8 suppose that the component of epsilon vector is introduced by equation 2 when 0 the 0 kam measures the technical efficiency of firms and divides the firms into two categories similar to dea models if the score of 0 kam is less than 1 for a firm that firm is technically inefficient and if the score of 0 kam is 1 the firm is technically efficient however the scores of 0 kam similar to dea models should neither be used to rank firms nor the proposed targets can be used to benchmark firms the kam is sbm tone 2001 where 0 1 and 1 when 0 and 1 and 1 we express the kam with sbm approach note that the sbm approach does not measure efficiency but can be used to introduce the technically efficient firms when 0 and 1 min 0 and 1 min 0 we state the kam with minimum approach suppose that and are given as the available costs of input and output factors where 1 2 and 1 2 we can decrease the discrimination power of kam as equations 9 10 represent to illus trate the lack of cf and rf or pf measurements respectively min 1 subject to 1 for 1 2 1 for 1 2 0 for 1 2 0 for 1 2 0 for 1 2 9 max 1 subject to 1 for 1 2 1 for 1 2 0 for 1 2 0 for 1 2 0 for 1 2 10 in other words none of equations 9 and 10 provide a fair measure to discrimination the efficiency of firms a suitable model should at least sat isfy the following types 1 6 for instance equation 9 does not satisfy type 4 and equation 10 does not satisfy type 3 a firm partially dominates another firm if and only if the val ue of equation 11 for is greater than that of where and belongs to 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 2 11 the six introduced types which increase the value of equation 11 are expressed by type 1 decreasing the value of denominator in equation 11 when the value of numerator is fixed type 2 increasing the value of numerator in equation 11 when the value of denominator is fixed type 3 if the rate of increasing the value of numerator in equation 11 is greater than the rate of increasing the value of denominator type 4 if the rate of decreasing the value of numerator in equation 11 is greater than the rate of decreasing the value of denominator type 5 the value of denominator in equation 11 is decreased increased by 1 decreasing increasing the value of one or more of input factors or 2 increasing decreasing a small value of one or more of input factors and decreasing increasing a large value of one or more of other input fac tors type 6 the value of numerator in equation 11 is increased decreased by 1 increasing decreasing the value of one or more of output factors or 2 decreasing increasing a small value of one or more of output fac tors and increasing decreasing a large value of one or more of other out put factors in short equation 5 shows that kam compares the efficiency of a firm with the efficiency of the points on the estimated production function and finds the best target for the firm regarding the value of epsilon and intro duced weights the discrimination power of kam is greater than cf rf and pf models and kam provides a complete measure to assess all the inefficiencies of the firms in the next sections kam is improved and the optimum of epsilon is also measured 4 0 kam and uncontrollable factors a researcher wants to compare eight homogenous international iranian airports labeled a h according to seven factors the area of airport hec tare the area of apron square meter the area of terminal square meter the area of runway square meter the number of operating flights the number of passengers movements the amount of air cargo metric ton as table 2 represents which airport does the job well table 2 the data of 8 homogenous airports n airport area apron terminal runway flights passengers cargo 1 a 1 200 304 182 45

709 741 39 556 the first four factors the areas of airport apron terminal and runway are input factors because they illustrate the infrastructure of airports and lesser values of these factors have worth the last three factors the num bers of operating flights and passengers movements and the amounts of air cargo are output factors because they represent the business and pro duction of airports and greater values of these factors have worth an air port which uses lesser amounts of input factors and greater amounts of output factors has done the job well in comparison with another airport the runway is an input factor which has the standard area according to the documents of international civil aviation organization icao the area of runway should not be less than the standard value and depends on the aircrafts which want to land and take off from that runway because of the safety of passengers decreasing the length area of a runway is not sug gested this kind of factor is called non controllable or uncontrollable fac tor banker and morey 1986 charnes et al 1987 cooper et al 2007 in other words an uncontrollable factor may not be controlled by managers although it may affect the performance of firms for instance suppose that th input factor 1 2 is an uncon trollable factor and the efficiency of is measured 1 2 if this uncontrollable factor should not be decreased and increased the corre sponded linear combination of this th input factor of firms in equation 4 7 that is 1 should be equal to the corresponded value of th factor of firm that is that is 1 where 1 2 nonetheless it is valuable to examine an epsilon neighborhood of an uncontrollable factor to measure the effect of such restriction on other factors for such an aim the constraint or can be added to the constraints in equation 5 equation 6 the term is a value which is added to th input factor of to intro duce a neighborhood of this factor thus the linear combination of this un controllable factor of firms is at least equal to that is 1 therefore the optimal value of th input factor is not decreased but it may slightly be increased according to value of for the case that the optimal value of th input factor should not also be increased the value of epsilon can be considered very small such that the value of is quite negligible for instance if th input factor is measured with three decimal digits the negligible error can be less than 0 005 simi lar discussion can be illustrated for an uncontrollable output factor as well now suppose that is a subset of input factor indexes 1 2 corresponded to the uncontrollable input factors and is a subset of out put factor indexes 1 2 corresponded to the uncontrollable output factors the kam is given by equation 12 see also khezrimotlagh et al 2012 a b 2013 and 2014 min 1 subject to 1 1 1 for 1 2 1 for 1 2 for for 0 for 1 2 0 for 1 2 0 for 1 2 0 12 for an example of uncontrollable factor suppose that fourth input fac tor runway is uncontrollable in the above airport example assume that 1 for 1 2 3 4 1 for 1 2 3 where is 0 0 0001 0 01 and 0 1 and the component of epsilon vectors are introduced by equation 3 since the weights are introduced by the inverse of data like sbm the approach is the sbm approach and the results are only used to express the methodology when 0 in equation 12 the corresponded constraints for fourth input factor of firm that is 4 4 and 4 8 1 4 1 4 are equal to zero that is 4 4 0 and 4 8 1 4 as table 3 illustrates the 0 kam by sbm approach represents that all air ports a h are technically efficient in other words this simple restriction on fourth factor of airports yields that airports c and e become technically efficient table 3 the kam scores where 4 4 epsilon a b c d e f g h 0 1 00000 1 00000 1

epsilon and the sbm approach if the uncontrollable factor cannot be decreased and increased the con straint 4 4 can be replaced by 4 4 the results of kam for this assumption are illustrated in table 3 in this case the value of fourth factor for airport number is not changed indeed the targets for firm 1 2 can be measured from equation 7 since 4 4 for instance when 0 0001 table 4 represents that the

4 or the targets by equation 5 lie on the frontier of feasible area and have better performance in comparison with the real data in table 2 regarding the assumptions of discrimination in other words 0 0001 kam not only discriminates the airports according to the introduced errors but it also benchmarks all technically efficient air ports and suggests how they can regulate their factors according to types 1 6 to improve their performances regarding the introduced assump tions for instance 0 0001 kam says that a should decrease the area of airport and increase the numbers of flights and passengers even if the area of apron and terminal are increased or the amount of cargo decreased ac cording to the value of epsilon and the sbm approach now suppose that 4 4 is only added the corresponded results to tables 3 are displayed in table 5 the constraint 4 4 does not let the value of fourth factor decrease but it may be increased to find a bet ter situation on the production frontier

when 0 0001 according to the table a should seriously improve the numbers of flights and passen gers even if the input factors are increased and the value of cargo is de creased in other words the inefficiency of a is due to the small numbers of flights and passengers according to the data of other airports these as sessments are approximations and do not mean that it is impossible to in crease the number of flights of airport a without increasing the values of its input factors but at the same time express the way of increasing the ef ficiency of a table 6 the 10 4 kam targets where 4 4

effectiveness and productivity are discussed productivity is a combination of effectiveness and efficiency in the effectiveness measurement the factors of each firm are compared with desired goals of the firms and in efficiency measure ment the firms performances are compared to each other the provided technical efficiency scores should not be used to rank firms they have un fortunately been used in the literature of operations research for the last four decades the provided scores by kam can relatively be meaningful according to the epsilon parameter and can be used to measure the effi ciency scores of firms which lets us rank and benchmark the firms logical ly references banker r d morey r 1986 efficiency analysis for exogenously fixed inputs and outputs operations research 34 513 521
