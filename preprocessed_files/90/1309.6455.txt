maximizing the spread of stable influence leveraging norm driven moral motivation for green behavior change in networks gwen spencer and richard b howarth abstract in an effort to understand why individuals choose to participate in personally expensive pro environmental behaviors environmental and behavioral economists have examined a moral motivation model in which the decision to adopt a pro environmental behavior depends on the society wide market share of that behavior an increasing body of practical research on adoption of pro environmental behavior empha sizes the importance of encouragement from local social contacts and messaging about locally embraced norms we respond by extending the moral motivation model to a social networks setting we obtain a new decision rule an individual adopts a pro environmental behavior if he or she observes a certain threshold of adoption within their local social neighborhood this gives rise to a concurrent update process which describes adoption of a pro environmental behavior spreading through a network the process evolves according to a set of difference equations in an exponentially large space that describes all possible patterns of adoption the original moral motivation model corresponds to the special case of our network version in a complete graph in parallel with the original moral motivation work we examine issues of stability of adoption which now depends intimately on the spatial distribution of adoption within the network bounds on the conver gence time of the process and the implications of the model on potential impacts of periods of temporary subsidy in particular we are interested in the planning question of how periods of temporary subsidy may be targeted in the network in order to ensure migration to a stable equilibrium with a high rate of participation in the pro environmental behavior at such a green equilibrium stability is enforced by egoistic utility benefits individuals experience from conforming to a locally embraced green norm and where positive externalities associated with high environment quality accrue to the entire society to examine this issue we create a time indexed integer program model which has modest size due to new general theorems we prove on convergence times that allows practically efficient measurement of the exact optimal set of individuals to target with subsidy making a connection to the theoretical computer science literature we prove that no rigorously efficient method exists to compute such a set our results are general and do not require that the network have any specific topological properties the qualitative predictions of the network moral motivation model can depart strongly from the predictions of the original moral motivation model for certain classes of networks careful targeting of subsidy within a network can greatly reduce the number of subsidized individuals required to reach the green equilibrium asymptotic classes of examples demonstrate that such departures can be severe further computational experiments show substantial departures for networks that resemble real social networks we deploy our ip model with off the shelf solvers in modestly sized highly clustered small world networks related to the famous small world networks of watts and strogatz neukom postdoctoral fellow neukom

voluntary participation in personally expensive pro environmental behaviors like opting in to pay a higher rate for electricity that is partially supplied by renewable sources like solar and wind appears illogical under classic economic models nev ertheless this option is offered by electric utilities in many parts of the united states and some members of the public opt to pay the higher rates 19 while the adoption of some pro environmental behaviors like curbside recycling may be actively encouraged by peer observation and corresponding fear of so cial dis utility for not conforming a phenomenon studied under the term social sanctioning adoption of minimally observable pro environmental behaviors led environmental and behavioral economists to explore models that include utility derived from moral motivation see 19 21 these models posit that individ uals experience utility when they feel that they are acting in accordance with a virtuous norm in particular the moral motivation model proposes that this utility benefit is non decreasing in the percentage of adoption society wide colloquially we might describe the moral motivation model as follows if an individual perceives a personally expensive in terms of time money etc green behavior to be a normal part of good citizenship then she can effectively be compensated for spending money or time engaging in the green behavior by the satisfaction of being a good citizen a natural policy question then arises 19 for settings where moral motivation applies how can we best motivate many individuals to adopt green behavior the importance of a local view in 19 nyborg howarth and brekke relax the assumption that individ uals have perfect knowledge of society wide adoption rates but individuals remain essentially symmetric knowledge is impacted by stochastic noise but every member of the society sees the same noisy picture of society wide adoption rates in strong contrast recent studies on attitudes and adoption of emerging green technologies and green behavior highlight the importance of normative encouragement from local social contacts and messaging about locally embraced norms of behavior in a qualitative study on consumer attitudes from the institute of transportation studies at u c davis entitled interpersonal influence within car buyer s social networks applying five perspectives to plug in hybrid vehicle drivers axsen and kurani 2 examine several frameworks that aim to understand how positive views of plug in hybrid electric vehicles phevs are shaped eleven families test drove phevs for a 4 6 week period their perceptions of the usefulness and convenience of the technology and their interactions with social contacts were tracked axsen and kurani highlight the existence of supportive pro societal values within the household s social network as one of three key factors that contribute to a high valuation of the benefits of phevs at the end of the trial this factor is important even when individuals have a technical understanding of the environmental benefits of phevs axsen and kurani conclude integrating concepts from contagion conformity and reflexivity this pa per points to the importance of disseminating functional awareness of such technologies stimulating interpersonal discussion of prosocietal benefits and marketing to a social network rather than only the individual car buyer 2 geographic proximity may also contribute to the local and thus spatially heterogeneous nature of norms about green behavior participation in a study from the journal of consumer research entitled a room with a viewpoint using social norms to motivate environmental conservation in hotels gold stein cialdini and griskevicius 13 conduct a sizable controlled experiment on how different norm based messages impact the reuse of towels by hotel guests switching from a standard door hanger message about saving the environment to a message about other hotel guests reusing towels at a high rate resulted in a 26 2 jump in towel reuse replacing a message of the later type with a message that other hotel guests in the same room reused towels at a high rate resulted in a further 15 jump in towel reuse goldstein et al describe their observations as the activation of a desire to conform to provincial norms they warn that attempts to market pro environmental behaviors by appealing to broader demographic categories e g to women may waste valuable opportunities in describing the environmental morale of individuals frey and stutzer 11 summarize the core results of laboratory experiments on when individuals will provide for the common good despite personal costs three of seven such results emphasize the importance of repeated contact with the same people in cluding face to face contact in determining when individuals will be willing to cooperate our extension network moral motivation strong empirical evidence suggests that people infer prevail ing pro environmental norms based on the behavior of the people they encounter and engage with and these norms are adopted in response to both internal motivation and social pressure we respond by extending the moral motivation model from 19 to networks in which individual behavior depends on the percentage of adoption among neighbors in the network each individual in the network has a threshold if the percentage of their neighbors that adopt a green behavior is above the threshold they also adopt the green behavior this decision rule corresponds to the egoistic benefit of conforming to a virtuous green norm overcoming the other costs associated with that behavior our work contributes to the growing exploration in the economic literature of how studied models may be extended to network settings for example the extensions of many game theoretic notions to networks as in 12 and 3 the latter of which specifically focuses on evaluating how each player based on network position impacts the equilibrium outcome 1 the decision rule described above gives rise to green behavior spreading through the network via a spread mechanism highly similar to the recently studied notion of complex contagion spreading through a network in the mathematical sociology literature see the work of centola et al 6 7 the main modeling difference is that following the extensive body of work on extending game theory to networks our model allows each individual to update their adoption status in every time step decisions to update are concurrent we also focus on different questions the work in sociology uses simulation to ask questions about what network properties best propagate a new behavior that arises in a random neighborhood of the network in contrast we are interested in planning questions in which a specific social network exists how can knowledge of this network inform the design of targeted campaigns to spread and normalize pro environmental behaviors the non network moral motivation model creates a framework with important implications for policies that aim to encourage pro environmental behavior in particular the findings in 19 predict that temporary periods of financial subsidy can cause migration from an equilibrium in which no members of the society adopt the pro environmental behavior to an equilibrium in which a high percentage of the society adopts the behavior once this favorable equilibrium is reached the society accrues additional environmental benefits associated with widespread pro environmental behavior the idea is that a temporary financial subsidy is implemented so that adopting the pro environmental behavior gives a utility gain regardless of adoption rates until some critical level of society wide adoption is reached once the critical level of adoption is reached the egoistic utility benefit of conforming to the widely adopted pro environmental norm is sufficient to guarantee convergence to a high adoption equilibrium without the adoption percentage driven moral motivation benefit classical models predict that when temporary subsidies are removed participation in the pro environmental behavior will disappear 1 with different connotations economists have used the term network effect to describe systems in which positive externalities accrue to members of a network as a set of adopters grows our model exhibits this property locally within the social network 3 in parallel with this original work on moral motivation we focus on on the policy planning question in networks where individuals have access to adoption information only among their neighbors how can understanding moral motivation in networks allow planners to leverage the boom in emerging informa tion about social networks to create temporary targeted subsidies or targeted public education campaigns that normalize pro environmental behavior as in the non network moral motivation model the goal is to convert the society to a stable virtuous equilibrium characterized by high levels of pro environmental behavior stability of this equilibrium after the temporary subsidy lapses again must be enforced by the moral motivation of individuals however in the network setting the issue of stability has become much more complex suppose that a particular member of the network is an adopter when the subsidy is in place but when it lapses an insufficient number of their neighbors are adopters to convince them to adopt due to moral motivation alone when they switch to non adoption each of their neighbors will also recom pute whether participating in the green behavior gives positive net utility etc effectively at the end of an intervention period participation in pro environmental behavior may be eroded by cascades that domino through the network the potential for such erosion has been described qualitatively by those interested in persistence of sustainability oriented policies regulations and economic incentives play an important role in encourag ing changes in behavior but although these may change practices without changes in social norms people often revert to the old ways when incentives end or regulations are no longer enforced and so long term protection may be compromised jules pretty 2003 science 20 to choose a good set of individuals to temporarily subsidize we must characterize the long term effect of subsidy this effect depends on a spatially heterogeneous pattern of adoption that evolves according to the local update rules we have described above a technical contribution of this work is proving that the evolving pattern of adoption converges almost and rather quickly there is one notion of temporary subsidy for which the evolution of the process can be cleanly divided into a phase in which adoption is growing and a second phase in which it is eroding in this setting it is straightforward to prove a bound on convergence time that is linear in the number of individuals in the network for another natural notion of temporary subsidy in which adoption and erosion of adoption proceed simultaneously the situation is more complicated here we extend results of goles from the early 80 s on the convergence of general threshold automata 14 proving a lemma on the monotonicity of the threshold based updating rule over the adoption vector 2 and describing a key function in a more intuitive way we give a convergence bound that is better by a factor of 2 regardless of the network and that is a arbitrarily small fraction of the bound from 14 when the average degree is constant and the number of members of the network is large 3 significantly we give an upper bound on the convergence time that is a small linear multiple of the number of edges or links in the network regardless of the degree distribution of nodes in the network 4 connections to notions of seeding influence in computer science the spread and optimal seeding of influence has been studied extensively in the theoretical computer science literature for spread mecha nisms where a single infected contact is enough to cause conversion see for example the canonical work 2 the threshold based update is a deterministic mapping from the adoption vector at time t to the adoption vector at time t 1 with input equal to the current adoption vector 3 we note that these network properties are likely to hold for social networks 4 in both cases some extensions to weighted variants which may describe that some neighbors adoptions are more significant to an individual than others or which may be convenient to model homophily that people are more likely to be influenced by social contacts that are similar to them are possible 4 of kempe kleinberg and tardos 15 that has been cited over 1 400 times this model has attracted great interest in both academic and industry research communities for its connections to viral marketing as the body of observable data on how purchases and product valuations flow through networks expands compa nies with products to sell and e advertising space to allocate are eager to learn as much as possible about how to market in this new landscape analogously as axsen and kurani suggest we seek to explore how green behaviors may be marketed what is fundamentally new about our work is addressing the influence maximization question with a strong notion of local thresholds and with an emphasis on long term stability of adoption both considerations essential to an honest extension of the moral motivation model 5 implications for cost benefit analysis the moral motivation model in 19 offers a theoretical foundation compatible with temporary subsidy policies that have already been implemented in practice and that appear to be succeeding in establishing stable participation in personally costly pro environmental behaviors a motivating example in 19 is a subsidy structure adopted in oslo norway where greener winter traction tires were subsidized until a fixed level of the population was using the green option then the subsidy was removed prior to subsidy studded tires were strongly preferred despite the availability of green alternatives this had resulted in particulate air pollution from road surface abrasion the use of studded tires vs greener traction tires is not visually obvious so effects of social sanctioning seem likely to be small when the subsidy was removed green adoption decreased only slightly and then seemed to remain stable the dramatic drop off classical arguments would predict based on the strong pre subsidy preference for studded tires was not observed further why would policymakers adopt a plan of this form the choice of such a subsidy structure seems to indicate that policymakers may already believe that using temporary subsidies to reach high levels of green adoption can have effects beyond the term of the subsidy that temporary subsidy may be able to enforce a permanent change in behavior expands the range of policy settings in which subsidy is a rational approach subsidy is generally rational when the cost of providing the subsidy annually is outweighed by the benefits that result from the resulting behavior change annually but if temporary subsidy can be used to cause a permanent shift in behavior then the cost of imposing the temporary subsidy for some number of years should now be weighed against all benefits accrued during the term of the subsidy and in the future due to the behavior change that results from the temporary subsidy discounted appropriately in particular in settings where moral motivation is in play the size of investments in subsidy policies and public education campaigns that are rational may be much larger than when the future benefit of permanent behavior change is ignored environmental economics is deeply concerned with appropriately valuing investments in environmentally sound practices if the benefits of these investments are under valued which may happen frequently in attempts to apply classical metrics for evaluating investment returns created to describe much simpler prod ucts or the estimates of their costs are inflated societies risk making highly inefficient choices about allo cation of resources this paper points out that if decision rules applied by individuals rely on local information then the level of investment required to reach a virtuous equilibrium may be much less than predicted by the non network model there exist classes of networks where taking advantage of the network structure can significantly 5 we note that a few results on a related theme of reversible threshold processes exist in the mathematics literature but the focus there is on characterizing extremely special classes of networks that exhibit certain properties for example that they can be completely converted by a set of a particular size given a particular uniform threshold etc not on optimization of influence within a given network for example see 8 or 1 the discrete math literature has also considered a problem of when iterative local computation in networks specifically agreeing with the majority of one s neighbors will converge to the majority opinion the focus there is on characterizing a specialized set of networks in which convergence to a homogeneous state that reflects the majority of the initial adoption vector is guaranteed 17 again this work is strongly divorced from our planning perspective 5 reduce the number of individuals that must be subsidized to reach the high adoption equilibrium thus the cost to reach the virtuous equilibrium could be much lower than is predicted by the non network model as environmental and behavioral economists and sociologists work to understand why individuals adopt pro environmental behaviors and the body of observable data about social networks continues to explode leveraging network characteristics in considering the costs and benefits of encouraging behavior change could critically impact cost benefit analyses used to evaluate important policies model richness the emergence of heterogeneous equilibria in addition to providing an encouraging message about the potential for moral motivation to act as an ally in stabilizing green equilibria our network model allows for long term heterogeneous outcomes in behavioral adoption that are intuitively satisfying in their realism exploring similar issues the statistical mechanics literature has considered spread mechanisms in ran dom networks where individuals are influenced by trends in adoption among their neighbors if a high percentage of their neighbors adopt a behavior they are very likely to adopt it etc e g 24 16 the widely studied version in 24 relies on a combination of a mathematically convenient update rule that in dividuals periodically choose a random neighbor to emulate and the assumption that these neighbors are always in some sense a representative sample of the society the process defined gives a random walk which must eventually converge to an adoption pattern that is totally homogeneous either the entire society participates or no one participates this model behavior feels suspiciously simplistic and insights based on such an approach feel brittle for example the finding that adding a single intransigent individual to a network who will never alter their opinion will unfailingly steer the entire society to their opinion 24 concerned with this simplistic equilibrium behavior recent work of centola 5 does manage to produce partial adoption equilibria by assuming a secondary adoption threshold above which the sign of the benefits of adoption becomes negative such an assumption seems highly unnatural for describing norm spread similarly the traditional moral motivation model from 19 can result in partial adoption equilibria that is a society wide fraction of adoption that is strictly greater than 0 but strictly less than 1 only by making some individuals more immune to moral motivation than others that is non adopters are evenly mixed throughout the population and are precisely those individuals that don t respond to the pressure to conform to norms at modest rates of society wide adoption our network model on the other hand allows stable adoption patterns that are not homogeneous without relying on the moral callousness of all non adopters stable pockets of non adoption may easily occur when certain portions of the network mainly talk to themselves and not to other portions of the network in which adoption is higher this speaks to the flavor of the famous work of nowak and may 18 on evolutionary games where introducing a network structure to repeated game play gives rise to persistent spatial hetero geneity anecdotal observations of the heterogeneous behavioral norms and locally normalized values in our society also seem to recommend models of norm formation that are capable of producing a rich set of heterogeneous equilibria observability of behavior and diversity of local influences egoistic moral utility benefits associated with conforming to locally embraced green norms could also help to stabilize observable pro environmental behaviors like curbside recycling avoiding littering purchase of fuel efficient vehicles use of public trans portation etc further many anecdotes offered to illustrate social sanctioning have a strong local flavor your neighbor judges you for not recycling etc if dis utility experienced by non adopters is non decreasing in the fraction of local adoption a reasonable seeming hypothesis then incorporating this effect does not change the form of the function we analyze in the following sections 6 2 the moral motivation model extending to networks we first describe the basic moral motivation model studied in 19 then explain an equivalent threshold based decision rule then extend this decision rule to a network in 19 each individual i has a function fi p 0 of the fraction of society wide adoption p that describes the moral utility benefit they receive for adopting the green behavior this is a non decreasing function 6 see figure 1 below the individual may also experience a small environmental quality benefit as a result of their green behavior choice this is specified to be additive in 19 the sum of these benefits is weighed against the individual cost of adopting the green behavior c this small environmental benefit from i adopting is also accrued by all other members of the society of green adoption total personal benefit 1 percentage adoptiona c figure 1 at the critical level of green adoption a the sum of the moral utility benefit and the personal environmental benefit of switching to green behavior overcomes the personal cost c associated with green behavior the focus in 19 is to understand behaviors where both fi 0 c if no other members of society adopt the green behavior then individual i will not adopt the green behavior for at least some individuals fi 1 c at a high rate of adoption at least some individuals will adopt even if they ar not directly subsidized to do so a temporary intervention like a subsidy of value s for adopting green behavior can be introduced so that fi 0 s c thus an individual will adopt the green behavior during the subsidy period at the time the subsidy is removed there is some society wide adoption rate p if fi p c then i will continue to engage in the green behavior otherwise i will stop engaging in the green behavior when the subsidy is discontinued individuals will repeatedly perform updates based on this decision rule some erosion of adoption rate may occur in 19 dynamics are studied for the case of uniform fi under the assumption that individuals update in a random order these assumptions give a system that conforms to replicator dynamics the convergence 6 this assumption makes quantitative frey and stutzer s observation that individuals who believe that others will contribute to a public good tend to contribute more themselves 11 or see 10 7 rate is proportional to the net benefit associated with adoption the replicator dynamics convergence analy sis in 19 relies critically on the assumption that under any current level of adoption the personal benefit of adoption is identical for every individual moral motivation in networks we define an extended model that applies the local decision rule from 19 to each individual in a network input a network or graph consisting of nodes and edges g v e each node in v is in one of two states green or brown we associate the green state with value 1 and the brown state with value 0 each node i has a critical susceptibility fraction i 7 this fraction is the minimal percentage of the neighbors of i that must be green before i will adopt the green behavior without being subsidized namely i argminp p fi p c notice that given g and i we can immediately obtain a cardinality threshold bi for adoption let i denote the set of i s neighbors in g then bi d i ie is the minimum number of green neighbors that will ensure i adopts when no subsidy occurs dynamics for each time step t every node i checks how many of his neighbors are green if more than bi neighbors of i are green i is set to green in time step t 1 otherwise i is set to brown in time step t 1 this update process iterates giving a binary adoption vector x t 0 1 v that evolves deterministically in time 8 figure 2 adoption in a local neighborhood determines behavior in the next time step green adoption in the present time step is indicated by thick green circles to decide adoption in the next time step each node checks the percentage of adoption within his set of neighbors for example the boxed node will adopt in the next time step if he has threshold 0 6 space of actions choose a set of nodes to temporarily subsidize these nodes will be green regard less of their neighbors behavior until the subsidy is removed goal when the subsidy is removed the long term behavior of the adoption vector exhibits a high fraction of green behavior 7 if i 1 we say i is intransigent following the statistical mechanics literature that considers individuals of fixed opinions 24 i will never adopt green behavior without subsidy 8 our choice of concurrent updating rather than the randomly ordered updating explored in 19 follows the extensive body of work on analyzing repeated game play in network settings that began in the early 90 s in work such as 18 8 in networks stability of adoption depends on spatial distribution an important difference between the traditional moral motivation model and our network version is in the ease of describing the long term conversion achieved by subsidizing a particular set of nodes in the traditional model if the individuals have uniform threshold i is constant the stability of conversion can be determined exactly by whether or not the critical level of adoption has been exceeded during the term of the subsidy in the network model describing the long term stability of a subsidy strategy must also consider the spatial distribution of the adopting nodes a pattern of adoption and the configuration of network connections will together either maintain a high level of green behavior or allow green adoption to slowly erode this added complexity makes description of the long term effects of a temporary subsidy significantly more challenging natural notions of temporary subsidy in the network model temporary temp the planner chooses a set of nodes to subsidize continuously until growth in green adoption stops then the subsidy is removed fixed duration fd the planner chooses a set of nodes to subsidize for d consecutive time steps then the subsidy is removed when d v we will show that fixed duration is a special case of temporary we list these models separately since we will prove much stronger results in the temporary case for each of these notions of temporary subsidy there are two natural planning problems to consider problem 1 min cost complete conversion mcc what is the smallest number of nodes that can be subsidized to convert the entire network 9 permanently to green behavior we consider both tempmcc and fdmcc 10 problem 2 budgeted maximum conversion bmc given budget of k nodes to subsidize what is the maximum percentage of the network that can be permanently converted to green behavior we consider both tempbmc and fdbmc 2 1 summary of results on stability convergence and hardness for all 4 problem variants we formulate time indexed integer programs that compute the precise optimal set of seeds for stable green adoption the correctness of these optimal seed sets depends critically on several theorems we prove about convergence of the evolving adoption vectors convergence from an arbitrary initial adoption state for the case of temporary subsidy temp we show convergence to a single stable adoption vector for fixed duration fd subsidy we show convergence to a 2 cycle in which two adoption vectors that may be identical alternate further we prove upper bounds on the number of time steps the adoption vector which evolves in the exponentially large space 0 1 v requires to converge in the worst case this upper bound is linear in the number of connections edges in the network or equivalently quadratic in the number of individuals in the network these upper bounds determine the number of variables in our ip formulations applying fast off the shelf solvers then allows practically efficient measurement of optimal seed sets provided that the network and its resulting ip is not too large 9 precisely convert all nodes with i 1 permanently to green behavior nodes with i 1 never adopt without direct subsidy 10 the assumption of uniform node subsidy cost is adopted for ease of exposition but our integer programs in section 4 can be trivially altered to accommodate non uniform costs 9 our method of computing optimal sets is not efficient in a rigorous sense 11 currently no rigorously efficient method for solving general integer programs is known in fact we prove that no efficient methods to find optimal seed sets exist 12 by reductions from set cover and maximum coverage models studied in the computer science theory literature further a significant notion in computer science theory is that beyond proving that an optimal solution for a problem cannot be found by any efficient algorithm a class of problems may be proved hard to approximate this formalizes the idea that the class of problems cannot even be solved approximately by an efficient algorithm consider a class of problems for which all feasible solutions for any input instance have non negative value the following is a widely embraced definition in the literature see 23 definition 2 1 an algorithm is a approximation if for every input instance the algorithm produces in polynomial time a feasible solution of value at least times the optimal possible value given the input for example for a maximization problem an efficient algorithm that always solves a problem perfectly is called a 1 approximation an efficient algorithm that always returns a solution of value at least 1 2 the optimal value is a 1 2 approximation etc for a minimization problem an efficient algorithm that always solves a problem perfectly is called a 1 approximation an efficient algorithm that always returns a solution of cost at most twice the optimal cost is called a 2 approximation etc the following table summarizes our results on the convergence states upper bounds on maximum con vergence times and hardness of approximation for the four problem variants results on stability convergence and hardness temporary temp fixed duration fd min cost converges to stable adoption vector converges to stable adoption vector complete convergence time bound 2 v convergence time bound d 2 e v conversion hardness ln v hardness ln v budgeted converges to stable adoption vector converges to 2 cycle maximum convergence time bound 2 v convergence time bound d 2 e v conversion hardness 1 1 e 0 632 hardness 1 1 e 0 632 notably in the temporary subsidy model our upper bounds on convergence time of the adoption vector are linear in the number of individuals in the network though the adoption vector evolves in an exponentially large space in the more general fixed duration subsidy model we give an upperbound on convergence time that is linear in the number of connections edges in the network we note that the average degree in social networks is often bounded by a constant for such networks all upper bounds given are linear in the number of individuals in the network we also note that considering a network which is a simple line shows that the best possible upper bound that could exist on adoption vector convergence time is v for social networks at most a constant factor improvement could be given in the upper bounds we prove the formal statement of these results and their proofs are included in the appendix for min cost complete conversion we prove that no efficient algorithm is ao ln v approximation this is by reduction from the set cover problem shown to be ln v hard to approximate in the work of feige 9 for budgeted maximum conversion we prove that no efficient algorithms achieves more 11 according to the standard notion of efficiency in computer science an algorithm is considered efficient if there exists a polynomial function f with the property that the running time of the algorithm on any input i is bounded above by the function f applied to the size of i 12 unless a ubiquitous assumption in the computer science literature is untrue though technically the validity of the assumption is an open problem 10 than a 1 1 e fraction of the optimal value this is by reduction from the maximum coverage problem the details of these reductions can be found in the appendix these rather daunting hardness results for network moral motivation point out that the well studied linear threshold model of kempe kleinberg and tardos a tangent to the main results from 15 in the cs theory literature represents an very special case of threshold based transmission kempe et al employ a very specialized assumption on the form of uncertainty in threshold values to establish the property of submodularity this property results in the success of certain approaches to solution construction unfortunately these approaches can fail dramatically for even slight variations on the form of uncertainty 3 contrasts with non network moral motivation in 19 the authors describe a number of properties of the original moral motivation model first note that our model generalizes the original moral motivation model the non network model corresponds exactly to the special case of our model where g is a complete graph 13 how much can the properties of the model vary when the graph is not complete that is in our network moral motivation model the answer is that the properties may be dramatically different original moral motivation complete graph g k v 1 the long term adoption rate resulting from a subsidy depends only on the number of individuals subsidized 2 when i is uniform achieving 100 adoption requires subsidizing the critical susceptibility fraction i of the entire society a 3 when i is uniform there are two stable equilibrium no adoption and 100 adoption heterogeneous stable equilibria can be obtained only when i is not uniform network moral motivation general g 1 the long term adoption rate resulting from a subsidy depends strongly on its spatial placement in the network 2 there exist networks with uniform i in which 100 adoption can be achieved by sub sidizing a vanishingly small percentage of the critical susceptibility fraction of society 3 networks may have many stable heterogeneous equilibria in addition to 2 homoge neous equilibria even when i is uniform 4 even when a subsidy set s can achieve 100 adoption almost every subsidy set of the size s can fail to do so sometimes miserably afor the non uniform threshold case there exist examples where no subsidy of less than a maxi i fraction of the society is sufficient for achieving 100 adoption 13 the complete graph on a set of nodes v has an edge between every pair of nodes in v the complete graph on v nodes is denoted k v 11 to make the above statements precise we demonstrate classes of networks where the properties asso ciated with network moral motivation depart strongly from the original version we examine asymptotic classes of examples to illustrate the severity of the departure possible later in section 5 these extreme departures for pathological networks motivate our exploration of the magnitude of departures for graphs that have been studied as proxies for social networks theorem 3 1 moral motivation in networks two subsidy sets of the same size may have widely different long term adoption rates this is true even when the i are uniform theorem 3 2 moral motivation in networks for any 0 there exists a network with uniform i in which stable conversion to the 100 adoption equilibrium can be accomplished by subsidizing at most v i individuals theorem 3 3 moral motivation in networks networks may have many stable heterogeneous equilib ria even when i is uniform theorem 3 4 moral motivation in networks given any 0 there exists a network which can be converted to 100 adoption by a set s but where a randomly selected set of size s fails to achieve 100 adoption with probability at least 1 this is true even when the i are required to be uniform when the i are allowed to be non uniform given an additional parameter 0 there exists a network where some subsidy set s gives 100 adoption but the expected adoption resulting from a random s size set is to prove these theorems we introduce several classes of networks 2 1 1 1 1 1 11111 figure 3 class 1 resulting cardinality thresholds bi are marked subsidiz ing any single node in the triangle for at least 3 time steps results in 100 adoption but subsidizing any single node not in the triangle for any number of time steps will result in long term adoption strictly less 50 class 1 g is composed of a triangle on three nodes with two legs each containing n nodes where the 12 first such node in each leg is a common node from the triangle let i 1 2 for all i v see figure 3 proof of theorem 3 1 as explained in figure 3 two subsidy sets of size 1 have widely different long term adoption rates for class 1 which has uniform proof of theorem 3 2 regardless of the value of n a network in class 1 can be converted to 100 adoption by subsidizing any single node in the triangle for at least three time steps a network of class 1 has 2 n 1 nodes thus for any 0 we can choose n sufficiently large so that 1 2 n 1 1 2 v we obtain an infinite class of examples for n n which satisfy theorem 3 2 proof of theorem 3 4 first half for a network in class 1 there are three possible subsidy sets of size 1 which result in 100 adoption if subsidy is maintained for three timesteps there are 2 n 2 sets of size 1 that result in strictly less than 50 adoption regardless of how long the subsidy is maintained thus while 100 adoption is achievable by subsidizing a single node for any 0 there exists sufficiently large n so that the probability of randomly selecting a single node that achieves 100 adoption is 3 2 n 1 class 2 g is composed of a triangle on three nodes with n legs of length 3 attached to a common node of the triangle the first node of each such leg is the common node in the triangle all nodes of degree 1 or 2 have i 1 2 the node of degree n 2 has 2 n 2 see figure 3 below 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 figure 4 class 2 resulting cardinality thresholds bi are marked subsidiz ing any single node in the triangle for at least 3 time steps results in 100 adoption but subsidizing any single node not in the triangle for any number of time steps will result in long term adoption rate of at most 2 2 n 3 proof of theorem 3 3 for networks of class 2 with n 1 there are both homogeneous and hetero geneous stable equilibria 100 adoption is a stable equilibrium 0 adoption is stable equilibrium and there are n stable heterogeneous equilibria of the form the two outer nodes in a leg are adopters and no other nodes adopt proof of theorem 3 4 second half for a network in class 2 there are three possible subsidy sets of size 1 which result in 100 adoption if subsidy is maintained for three timesteps there are 2 n 13 sets of size 1 that result in 2 2 n 3 adoption regardless of how long the subsidy is maintained computing the expected adoption rate achieved by selecting a random set of size 1 expectation 3 2 n 3 1 2 n 2 n 3 2 2 n 3 10 n 9 2 n 3 2 thus while 100 adoption is achievable by subsidizing a single node for any 0 there exists sufficiently large n so that the expected adoption rate achieved by selecting a random set of size 1 is strictly less than 4 formulating integer programs in this section we apply our results on convergence states and times to write down integer programs that perfectly calculate the optimal set of individuals nodes to subsidize let i denote the set of neighbors of i in g recall the problem variants from section 2 4 1 temporary min cost complete conversion tempmcc decision variables subsidy variables for i v yi 1 if node i is subsidized from time step 0 to v 0 otherwise adoption variables for i v t 0 1 2 2 v xit 1 if node i adopts at time t 0 otherwise subsidy size a dummy variable q describes the size of the subsidized set we wish to minimize q subject to the following constraints first the number of nodes that are chosen for subsidy is at most q i v yi q during the period of the subsidy a node i is allowed to be an adopter only if either it is subsidized or if at least bi of its neighbors are adopters during the previous time step due to the integrality of the adoption and subsidy variables this condition is enforced precisely by the following inequality xit yi 1 bi j i xj t 1 for t 0 1 2 v i v from the proof of lemma 7 2 in the appendix assuming that the subsidy is maintained for v time steps and is then removed gives the same behavior as if subsidy is removed immediately after the first step in which no 0 to 1 conversions occur that is assuming subsidy is maintained for v time steps perfectly 14 emulates the conditions we defined for temporary subsidy after the period of subsidy ends a node i is allowed to be an adopter only if at least bi of its neighbors are adopters during the previous time step xit 1 bi j i xj t 1 for t v 1 v 2 2 v i v from lemma 7 3 in the appendix imposing the above condition for v time steps after subsidy is removed ensures that the process will have converged to a stable adoption vector forcing the adoption variables for the final time step to 1 ensures we only consider solutions which result in 100 adoption this is enforced by requiring that for all i v xi 2 v 1 combining these constraints we obtain the following ip that computes the smallest subsidy set which permanently converts the entire network minimize q subject to i v yi q xit yi 1 bi j i xj t 1 for t 0 1 2 v i v xit 1 bi j i xj t 1 for t v 1 v 2 2 v i v xi 2 v 1 for i v a technical note a sequence of adoption variables that constitute a feasible solution for the ip may not perfectly match the evolving adoption vector of the process in particular a set of adoption variables may lag the true adoption vector the process effectively turns on from 0 to 1 a node as soon as possible while we only require that the ip not turn on from 0 to 1 a node if it is not justified in doing so the second and third sets of constraints ensure this this discrepancy might seem disconcerting for a moment we might worry that the ip could gain some advantage by lagging the process and thus produce a subsidy solution that is apparently the best but in fact performs badly with respect to the true adoption evolution process the answer to this concern is theorem 7 1 from the appendix on the monotonicity of the process when our goal is enlarging the set of adopters there is never an advantage in delaying turning a node from 0 to 1 the formulation of the ips for the other 3 problem variants is highly similar though the form of the constraint sets for the fixed duration cases depend on the case specific convergence bounds we prove in the appendix the three other model formulations tempbmc fdmcc fdbmc are included in the appendix 4 2 intransigent individuals weighted neighbors differential costs of subsidy intransigence the model can describe intransigent individuals by letting the cardinality threshold bi ex ceed the degree of the node i this threatens to make our min cost complete conversion problems infeasible intransigent individuals will clearly violate the constraint that they be adopters in the final time step by doing a simple iterative search in the network it is easy and efficient to identify a set of nodes 15 that are explicitly intransigent or implicitly intransigent they are intransigent once all explicitly intransigent nodes are removed from the network or once other implicitly intransigent nodes are removied etc this gives a network of intransigence the planner can never hope to influence these nodes to adopt without direct indefinite subsidy removing the final time step constraint for nodes in this network of intransigence gives a variation of min budget complete conversion in which we can compute the minimum size subsidy set that permanently converts all nodes which are not in the network of intransigence weighted neighbors suppose that the adoption of some set of is neighbors is more important to i than the adoption of other sets of is neighbors we might model this by weighting each neighboring adoption status 0 or 1 by a scalar before comparing to a threshold bi in particular when symmetric weights are used to describe homophily of individuals how alike a pair of individuals are and weights are chosen from the set of integers 1 2 k for some constant k nearly all our results go through immediately with somewhat diluted but still linear upperbounds on convergence time for the fixed duration case we mention this in reference to recent work in the mathematical sociology literature on how homophily appears to contribute substantially to increased rates of healthy behavior transmission in social networks 4 differential costs of subsidy none of our convergence or monotonicity results require the cost of subsi dizing nodes to be uniform trivial alteration of the integer programs specified allows perfect computation in the non uniform case 5 computational results the integer programs introduced can be solved for modestly sized networks using off the shelf integer programming solvers we use cplex to solve models formulated in the ampl language a large space of questions might be explored using these tools we defer more extensive computational exploration to a later study and concentrate here on preliminary computational observations related to the asymptotic results in section 3 networks that look like social networks social networks are generally characterized by high levels of local density or high clustering coefficient 14 in combination with low average shortest path length between randomly selected pairs 22 the canonical work of watts and strogatz 22 demonstrated that starting from uniform lattices rings and square lattices random rewiring of even a small percentage of the edges quickly gives rise to networks with these properties qualitatively even a very small percentage of random long ties results in a small world similar rewiring schemes have been used widely in the sociology literature to create test networks to examine the spread of complex contagion see 6 and 7 in this section we describe computational observations for classes of networks with these properties that are composed of dense local communities which are linked via a random rewiring procedure then we computationally investigate analogs of theorem 3 2 and theorem 3 4 for these networks 16 dense local communities randomsmaller world increasing randomness p 1 p 0 figure 5 randomly rewired clusters a random rewiring scheme analogous to that in 22 interpolates between dense local communities small complete graphs and a random network above we start with 5 complete graphs each containing 6 nodes for each edge in the graph we rewire it with probability p the edge is removed from the graph and replaced by a randomly chosen edge between one of its endpoints and a random node from any community we do this procedure for every edge in the leftmost figure eliminating rare duplicate edges when they appear when p 0 no edges are rewired this gives the leftmost figure as p increases some local ties are replaced by longer random ties reducing the average path length between pairs but maintaining fairly high clustering coefficient when p 1 the procedure will give a ran dom graph with low clustering coefficient very low average path length and closely preserved average degree 5 1 what percentage of subsidy can convert the whole network in theorem 3 2 we saw that for some highly pathological classes of networks with uniform threshold 1 2 subsidizing a vanishing fraction of the critical percentage of the network a vanishing fraction of n would be sufficient to convert the entire network to adoption question is there a very small subsidy set that converts the entire network for networks that look like real social networks our observations for the rewired cluster graphs of size 30 as described in figure 5 indicate that for a range of p values giving rise to a range of clustering coefficient average path length pairs and a range of values the optimal size of a set that converts the entire network is less than 1 2 n see figure 6 for a graphical summary over a range of p pairs when we require that complete adoption in the network is obtained quickly the size of subsidy required increases but only becomes larger than n when we insist that complete adoption be reached after only 14 following 22 the clustering coefficient is defined as follows for each node v in the graph look at its set of immediate neighbors not including itself let kv denote the size of this set the largest number of edges that could exist between two members of this set is kv kv 1 2 let cv denote the fraction of these possible edges that actually exist the clustering coefficient of the graph is the average of cv over all nodes v 17 l 2 51 c 0 33 l 2 60 c 0 40 l 2 28 c 0 28 l 2 65 c 0 48 l 2 61 c 0 43 l 2 66 c 0 44 l 2 81 c

suffice to reach 100 adoption unless we re quire that total adoption be reached very quickly targeted subsidy of at most 1 2 n nodes appears to suffice in this parameter range each row of the figure shows three runs for a fixed rewiring probability p in the 30 node graph de scribed in figure 5 with the clustering coefficient c and average path length l listed for each run at left for varying values of the threshold level one time step of subsidy qualitatively if local norm spreading is given time to operate the percentage of subsidy required to reach 100 adoption decreases substantially from what is predicted by the non network moral motivation model of 19 5 2 how much does network position based targeting help if we had no specific knowledge about the social network we might optimistically hope that a randomly placed subsidy in the network would perform reasonably well compared to the best targeted subsidy of the same size qualitatively we are hoping that the information deficit lack of knowledge of the network is not too costly in terms of the long term adoption we are able to establish with our subsidy campaign 18 increasing random rewiring 30 0 30 0 30 0 30 0

timal seeding set result in 100 long term adoption as thresholds increase the average adoption resulting from a randomly selected set decreases though notably this quantity has high variance and some randomly selected sets do result in 100 adoption this observation appears to hold for a range of rewiring probabilities p for each p the figure shows three randomly rewired clusters of size 30 for each randomly rewired cluster over a range thresh olds the performance of 10 randomly selected seed sets of size identical to the optimal seed set for total adoption is observed in theorem 3 4 we saw that for certain classes of specialized networks even when a small set exists that converts the entire network a randomly selected set of the same size could result in very low expected long term adoption qualitatively this means that in certain classes of networks careful targeting gives substantial gains in long term adoption question for networks that look like real social networks if k targeted subsidies are sufficient to convert the entire network how much adoption results from a randomly selected k set 19 in figure 7 we observe that when thresholds are very small randomly selected sets perform simi larly to the optimal seeding set however as thresholds increase corresponding to when the percentage of local adoption must be higher in order to surpass the personal cost of the green behavior we observe that randomly located subsidies are substantially less effective on average that is the importance of target ing appears to increase as thresholds increase we note that some randomly selected sets do perform very well in terms of long term adoption though we suspect that how often this happens may be influenced by the number of initial clusters in this case 5 and the size of the optimal seeding sets which are relatively small in the examples we observe for the parameter range we examine though small sets that result in high long term adoption do not appear to be highly rare we note that the heuristic strategy of randomly selecting many sets of small size and choosing a good one does require knowledge of the social network notice in figure 7 that the performance of the randomly selected sets often corresponds to multiples of 6 this is due to green behavior stabilizing in several local communities but not being able to spread through the rewired ties into the remaining communities comment we consistently observed that for a fixed network solve times were much slower for large values of where large is above 1 2 6 conclusion to explore how the spread of pro environmental behaviors can be best encouraged in social networks we extend the moral motivation model from 19 to networks the green behaviors we are interested in spread in a very different way from disease or information and motivate a complex optimization problem to exam ine natural planning questions about seeding the spread of green norms we create a practical computational tool that relies on new results we prove on stability and convergence of an evolving spatially heterogeneous vector of adoption for specialized classes of networks targeting subsidy based on the social network and adoption thresholds yields huge gains over strategies that specify only the size of the subsidized set our computational experiments in networks which replicate the high clustering and small world path lengths characteristic of real social networks indicate that milder but still substantial advantages may be gained by careful subsidy targeting targeting subsidies based on knowledge of social network structure could result in more long term green adoption or in substantial reduction in the costs of stabilizing wide spread participation in pro environmental behaviors the subsidy size required to establish stable society wide adoption is predicted to be much smaller than under the non network model at most half the size for the modest examples we explore further in networks that resemble real social networks the relative advantage of social network based targeting appears to increase as thresholds increase for green behav iors where moral motivation applies good information about social network structure and targeted subsidy based on this information may increase the benefits and reduce the costs of subsidy and public education campaigns that aim to establish long term participation in environmentally friendly behaviors a rigorous understanding of the local norm driven nature of marketing green adoption could critically impact the future cost benefit calculations that inform public investment aimed at achieving sustainable practices we have just scratched the surface of the computational exploration that is possible with the ip tool we have introduced here a study on the properties of sets of high influence with respect to the threshold based spread mechanism described here is underway we expect significant departures from the qualitative properties of sets of high influence under information spread mechanisms there are also a number of natural questions on the robustness of seeding strategies to noisy specification of the network and how stability of high green adoption equilibria is threatened by evolving network structure increasing personal costs of green behaviors etc 20 references 1 s s adams z brass c stokes and d s troxell irreversible k

section we establish several theorems about the moral motivation model in networks that will be required in our integer program formulations a prime issue in the formulation is the convergence time and convergence states of an adoption vector how many time steps of the update process are necessary in order to describe the long term adoption rate for adoption vector x t 0 1 v let ax t denote the set of indices i for which xi t 1 theorem 7 1 monotonicity of the future adoption set in the current adoption set let x and x denote two different adoption vectors that are evolving in time under identical subsidy conditions for arbitrary t if ax t ax t then for all t t ax t ax t proof we prove the theorem by induction starting at time step t from the assumptions of the theorem ax t ax t induction hypothesis suppose that for time step t 1 we have ax t 1 ax t 1 consider time step t for each node i v if i ax t then it must be the case that at least bi neighbors of i are inax t 1 since all nodes which are inax t 1 are also inax t 1 by the induction hypothesis at least bi neighbors of i are in ax t 1 thus by the update rule for i we get that x i t 1 so that i ax t 7 1 temporary subsidy and fixed duration with d v 2 v time steps are sufficient to converge to a stable adoption vector the analysis in this section is relatively simple because the growth of adoption updates from 0 to 1 and erosion of adoption updates from 1 to 0 are divided cleanly into separate phases the growth phase occurs 22 while the subsidy is maintained and the erosion phase begins in the first time step in which subsidy is removed we explain below we start with a trivial but useful observation suppose that the subsidy is either maintained indefinitely or has already been removed if there is a series of 2 time steps in which the adoption vector is unchanged then it will never change in the future that is if x t x t 1 then for all t t we have x t x t lemma 7 2 growth phase for any set of nodes s v if s is subsidized from time 0 until the first time step g in which no new adoptions occur then g is at most v further if subsidy of s is maintained indefinitely after g and no additional nodes are subsidized no new adoptions occur after g proof while subsidy of s is maintained there is no back migration from 1 to 0 recursively all nodes that convinced any node to adopt are still adopters themselves while the subsidy is maintained if there is a single step g with no new node adoptions growth of adoption must be over since the next new adoption that occurs say in time step q will be based on adoption vector x g 1 just as x g was since x g has no new adopters x q will have no new adopters contradicting the choice of time step q as the next in which a new adoption happens thus since at least one node newly adopts in each time step starting from time 0 and no back migration occurs while subsidy of s is maintained after at most v timesteps adoption has stopped increasing lemma 7 3 erosion phase let x r 0 1 v denote the adoption vector at the time step r when subsidy is removed if x r x r 1 then all future updates will be from 1 to 0 and the adoption vector will converge to a stable adoption vector within v time steps proof since x r x r 1 no future updates from 0 to 1 will occur as argued in the proof of the previous lemma in particular let s denote the set of all non adopters at time r all nodes in s will have value 0 in all future time steps setting b i max i bi 0 view the process of erosion as a subsidy at nodes in s to encourage converting to 0 which is maintained indefinitely and spreading via the network moral motivation model with thresholds b i the evolving adoption vector that results is exactly identical to the evolution of the adoption vector for the original process applying the previous lemma gives that a time step with no new 1 to 0 updates will occur within v time steps and that after that time step the adoption vector will never change as a direct consequence of these two lemmas we obtain theorem 7 4 convergence for tempmcc tempbmc and fd with d v consider a subsidy that is maintained for v time steps or until growth in new adoptions stops and is then removed a total of 2 v time steps is sufficient for the adoption vector to converge to a stable equilibrium 7 2 general fixed duration case d 2 e v steps are sufficient to converge to a cycle of length at most 2 after the subsidy is removed at time d allowing how many more time steps to elapse will ensure that the adoption vector accurately gauges long term adoption notably unlike in the previous case the growth and erosion of adoption may now proceed simultaneously in the network in the previous case we naturally got convergence to a stable adoption vector when subsidy is fixed duration this is not guaranteed consider the example given in the figure below 23 11 1 1 2 figure 8 an alternating cycle of length 2 with average adoption 50 here is uniformly 1 2 suppose that the planner can subsidize one node for one time step subsidizing a node of degree 1 gives long term adoption 0 subsidizing the central node in time step 1 in time step 2 the central node looks at its neighbors status from time step 1 and thus stops adopting while each degree 1 node sees that the central node adopted in time step 1 and so adopts in time step 2 in time step 3 each degree 1 node sees that the central node did not adopt in time step 2 and thus decides not to adopt in time step 3 while the central node sees at least 2 neighbors adopted in time step 2 and so adopts in time step 3 thus adoption in time step 3 is identical to adoption in time step 1 since updates are deterministic the adoption vector is in a cycle of length 2 every odd time step has only the central node adopting every even time step has all nodes except the central node adopting thus the optimal average adoption is 50 it is not immediately clear that a meaningful concept of long term behavior exists if the adoption vector does not converge in the example in figure 7 2 an average rate can be computed because we notice that adoption has entered a small cycle of length 2 but suppose that this does not happen perhaps the adoption vector enters an exponentially long cycle or no cycle at all this would endanger our scheme to optimize the adoption rate with a small integer program the objective function might have exponentially many terms fortunately the example in figure 7 2 is in essence as bad as possible we can always capture the longterm average adoption as an average over two consecutive adoption vectors provided we wait a sufficient number of time steps before computing this quantity theorem 7 5 convergence for fdmcc fdbmc if subsidy is removed at time step d then within 2 e v time steps the evolving adoption vector will converge to a cycle of length at most 2 next we explain the proof of this theorem which requires the proof of a number of intermediate lemmas the update rule of our network moral motivation model is a special case of the general threshold based up date rule goles analyzed in 14 we follow goles analysis closely but by exploiting the monotonicity of our restricted case and emphasizing a more combinatorial description of a key function we give significantly tighter results for our model further we state an explicit bound that is linear in the size of the edge set of the network regardless of degree distribution whereas 14 states explicit bounds only for uniform degree networks in the following proof we will use the fact from 14 that for a set of specified integer cardinality thresholds our model as described until now denoted bi for i v replacing bi with bi 0 5 for all i gives an identical update procedure 15 thus without loss of generality we will assume all thresholds are half integer 15 e g replacing a threshold of 3 at node i with a threshold of 2 5 changes nothing about how the adoption vector will change 24 lemma 7 6 adoption enters a cycle 14 suppose the subsidy is removed at time d and the adoption vector evolves according to the update rule there exists a c with the property that x t x t c x t 2 c and that x t is not equal to any of x t 1 x t 2 x t c 1 for all t above some transient time t proof the space of possible adoption vectors 0 1 v is finite thus at some time step an adoption vec tor y must be repeated and since the update process is deterministic the behavior from that point forward will be identical to the evolution after the first occurrence of y giving a cycle we ll define and analyze a special function e x t in contrast to the analysis in 14 we describe e x t in terms of the update process in the network to do this we introduce the idea of sightings given an adoption vector y 0 1 v we say that node i sights each of its neighbors which is 1 according to y 16 the expression for e x t will include two terms related to sightings sightings necessary to get x t if x t occurs during our updating process we can give a bound on how many sightings must have happened in the graph at time t 1 if i is 1 at t it must have sighted at least bi neighbors which were 1 thus throughout the graph at least v i 1 bixi t b x t sightings necessary to get x t sightings must have happened at t 1 this counts accurately bi is included exactly when xi t is 1 sightings wasted in turning on x t 1 the adoption vector x t produces the next state x t 1 each node i that is 1 in x t 1 saw at least bi sightings in x t but i may also have sighted some extra neighbors at 1 beyond the bi that were required we say these sightings were wasted in turning on x t 1 letai denote the ith row of the adjacency matrix for g 17 the number of sightings that were wasted at node i is aix t bi so summing over i v i 1 aix t bi xi t 1 ax t b x t 1 sightings wasted in turning on x t 1 this counts the correct quantity because aix t bi is included in the sum exactly when xi t 1 1 defining e x t e x t sightings necessary to get x t sightings wasted in turning on x t 1 b x t ax t b x t 1 lemma 7 7 14 if the adoption vector has not entered a 2 cycle aka assuming x t 6 x t 2 then e x t is decreasing e x t 1 0 5 e x t 16 in terms of our update process are the number of sightings i makes at x t greater than bi if so then i is 1 at time t 1 17 the adjacency matrix of g is the v v matrix that has aij 1 exactly when the edge i j is in g and has all other entries 0 25 proof the proof of this lemma is largely from 14 we include the details for completeness and because they are critical to explaining the subsequent improvements we make we will show e x t e x t 1 0 5 e x t e x t 1 b x t ax t b x t 1 b x t 1 ax t 1 b x t 2 b x t ax t x t 1 ax t 1 b x t 2 b x t ax t 1 x t ax t 1 b x t 2 ax t 1 b x t ax t 1 b x t 2 x t 2 x t ax t 1 b in the algebra above first we make a combined term for all sightings at t by nodes which are 1 at t 1 next we switch the order of summation sightings by 1 s from t 1 at x t are the same as sightings by 1 s from t at x t 1 which is alternately true from a a symmetric matrix then simply combine terms the righthand side sums the following term over all nodes i xi t 2 xi t aix t 1 bi if i has the same state in x t 2 and x t then the term for i has value 0 if xi t 2 1 and xi t 0 xi t 2 1 means aix t 1 bi 0 5 if xi t 2 0 and xi t 1 xi t 2 0 means aix t 1 bi 0 5 these facts follow from the half integrality of the bi in both cases where xi t 2 6 xi t the term for node i contributes at least 1 2 to the value of e x t e x t 1 since we assumed we are not in a 2 cycle yet aka that x t 6 x t 2 there must be at least one i that contributes value 1 2 we can now prove that the evolving adoption vector will converge to a cycle of length at most 2 proof second half of theorem 7 5 suppose the cycle guaranteed by lemma 7 6 has length c 2 x t x t c and x t is not equal to any of x t 1 x t 2 x t c 1 we can apply lemma 7 7 e x t e x t 1 e x t 2 e x t c since x t x t c we also have that e x t e x t c this gives a contradiction thus c 2 we have already shown in lemma 7 7 that e x t decreases in every time step unless the process has converged to its final 2 cycle so bounding the range of e x t will give an upper bound on the transient time of the process this is our general strategy but to give an improved upper bound we use the mono tonicity of our process lemma 7 1 to show that unless the process is already very close to a 2 cycle the decrease in e x t is twice as large per time step as specified by lemma 7 7 lemma 7 8 unless the evolving adoption vector is within 2 v time steps of entering a 2 cycle at least 2 nodes i have xi t 6 xi t 2 so that e x t 1 1 e x t 26 proof suppose that x t 2 differs from x t in only one position we ll show that the adoption vector enters a 2 cycle within 2 v time steps let nx t denote the subset of v corresponding to nodes that are at 1 in x t suppose that xi t 2 1 and xi t 0 and for all other j xj t 2 xj t by definition nx t nx t 2 we use monotonicity to reason about the set of adopters in following time steps consider nx t 1 it results from sightings at nx t since nx t nx t 2 all sightings at nx t hap pen at nx t 2 thus nx t 3 is a superset of nx t 1 any node that decided to adopt based on x t will certainly adopt based on x t 2 by the same rationale nx t 1 nx t 3 gives that nx t 2 nx t 4 then nx t 2 nx t 4 gives that nx t 3 nx t 5 etc this argument holds iteratively to make this more clear write the set of adopters in a z pattern using nx t nx t 1 to denote that the set of adopters at time t 1 results from the set of adopters at time t nx t nx t 1 nx t 2 nx t 3 nx t 4 nx t 5 nx t 6 nx t 7 now add the subset relationships nx t nx t 1 nx t 2 nx t 3 nx t 4 nx t 5 nx t 6 nx t 7 since the update process is deterministic if any of these relationships is not proper then the adoption vector has entered a 2 cycle that is ifnx t k nx t k 2 then it also must be the case thatnx t k 1 nx t k 3 so that for all time steps after t k the adoption vector alternates between x t k and x t k 1 the maximum number of time steps that could elapse before a relationship is forced to be non proper is 27 2 v since all the subsets must be proper at least one node is in nx t k 2 nx t k for all k the longest path that could ever be achieved is if nx t is the empty set and nx t 2 v is the entire set v after this many time steps it must be the case that nx t k 2 nx t k the adoption vector has entered a 2 cycle within 2 v time steps a symmetric argument with opposite direction of relationships establishes the case where xi t 2 0 and xi t 1 and for all other j xj t 2 xj t we have established that if x t 2 differs from x t in only one position the adoption vector will enter a 2 cycle within 2 v time steps equivalently if the adoption vector is more than 2 v time steps from entering a 2 cycle then it must be that if x t 2 differs from x t in strictly more than 1 position thus evaluating the final expression from the proof of lemma 7 7 e x t e x t 1 x t 2 x t ax t 1 b 1 lemma 7 9 the range of values that e x t can achieve is 2 e recall the definition of e x t e x t sightings necessary to get x t sightings wasted in turning on x t 1 from our definitions of necessary and wasted sightings the first term is always positive or 0 and the second term is always negative or 0 letting the first term be as large as possible and the second term be as small as possible we obtain an upper bound on e x t of v i 1 bi every node in v makes the necessary sightings for it to adopt an obvious lower bound on e x t assumes the first term is 0 and makes the second term as large in magnitude as possible as many wasted sightings as possible at every node e x t v i 1 deg i bj v i 1 deg i v i 1 bi thus the range of e x t is at most v i 1 deg i 2 e proof convergence time claimed in theorem 7 5 we start from the end of the subsidy period the range of e x t is at most 2 e from lemma 7 9 at most 2 v steps can decrease e x t by only 1 2 every other step must have size at least 1 thus there are at most 2 v 2 e v 1 2 e v time steps after the subsidy is removed before the adoption vector enters a 2 cycle

provided that d 3 for both cases we reduce to problems with hardness guarantees due to feige 9 both reductions will rely on constructing instances with intransigent nodes that have i 1 consider the set cover problem defined as follows let s denote a set of elements 1 2 n let f denote a group of subsets of s which we will denote j 1 j 2 j f the objective is to specify the smallest set of indices i so that i iji s theorem 8 1 the set cover problem can be reduced in polynomial time to an instance of min cost complete conversion for any subsidy duration of at least 3 time steps proof reducing to min cost complete conversion for arbitrary d 3 given an instance of the set cover problem construct an instance of min cost complete conversion as follows construct a graph with three sets of nodes for each subset ji introduce a subset node called nji and for each element q introduce an element node called nq if element q is in subset ji then add the edge nq nji to the graph finally each element node nq has a unique dummy copy called n q and the edge nq n q is in the graph see the figure below nodes dummy nodes element subset nodes figure 9 a schematic of a constructed instance for every element node let nq 1 f 1 for every subset node let nji 1 for some small 0 and for every dummy node let n q 1 29 notice that subset nodes will adopt only when they are directly subsidized thus all element nodes that will ever adopt for any reason will do so by the end of the third time step at latest if any single neighbor of an element node adopts the element node will also adopt if an element node and its dummy node are both adopters when subsidy is removed they will both be permanent adopters given a black box to solve min cost complete conversion we get the smallest set to subsidize that converts all element and dummy nodes permanently after a subsidy of duration d 18 call this current optimal subsidy set o we explain how to find a subsidy set consisting only of subset nodes which has size o and converts all element and dummy nodes permanently within the same duration of subsidy suppose that o contains a dummy node n q then the updated set o nq n q has size at most o and converts all element and dummy nodes permanently after a subsidy of duration d notice that if o nq n q o this would contradict the optimality ofo repeat until all dummy nodes have been removed from o suppose that the updated o contains an element node nq since o is the smallest set that permanently converts all element nodes some subset node that is a neighbor of nq must not be in o otherwise removing nq fromo gives a smaller subsidy set that converts all element and dummy nodes within duration d let njk denote such an unsubsidized neighbor the alternate subsidy set o njk nq has size o and converts all element and dummy nodes permanently within duration d repeat until all element nodes have been removed from o now we have a set of o subset nodes that permanently converts all element and dummy nodes by our construction this means that the set of subset indices corresponding to our subsidy set has resulting union equal to the entire set of elements s since an element node adopts precisely when a subset node that is its neighbor is subsidized thus we have a solution of size o for the set cover instance for the original set cover instance suppose that a strictly smaller solution for the set cover instance exists then subsidizing the corresponding set of subset nodes in our constructed min cost complete con version instance would give a subsidy set that permanently converts all element and dummy nodes for any subsidy of length at least 3 time steps all element nodes would be converted in the second time step all dummy nodes in the third time step but has size o this contradicts the optimality of o for the constructed instance thus a black box for min cost complete conversion gives a polynomial time algorithm to solve the set cover instance exactly thus min cost complete conversion for arbitrary d 3 inherits ln v hardness from the set cover problem this hardness holds unless np has slightly superpolynomial time algorithms see 9 for details consider the budgeted maximum coverage problem defined as follows let s denote a set of elements 1 2 n let f denote a group of subsets of s which we will denote j 1 j 2 j f given a budget k the objective is to specify a set of k indices i so that the cardinality of the following union is maximized i iji theorem 8 2 the budgeted maximum coverage problem can be reduced in polynomial time to an instance of budgeted maximum conversion for any subsidy duration of at least 3 time steps proof the graph constructed is identical to the previous case we make the additional observation that for subsidy duration of at least 3 the permanent adoption status of an element node and its dummy are identical either both are adopters or neither adopts 18 this is the most permanent adoption that can be achieved since all subset nodes have nji 1 30 given a black box to solve budgeted maximum conversion we get a size k subsidy set that converts the maximum possible number of element dummy pairs of nodes permanently after a subsidy of duration d call the number of pairs converted h as in the case above we can produce a subsidy set of the same size which permanently converts an identical set of element dummy pairs but is composed only of subset nodes now we have a set of k subset nodes that permanently converts h element dummy pairs by our construction this means that the set of subset indices corresponding to our subsidy set has resulting union of cardinality h since an element node adopts precisely when a subset node that is its neighbor is subsidized thus we have a solution of size k with union containing h members of s for the budgeted maximum coverage instance for the original budgeted maximum coverage instance suppose that some other solution of size at most k has union of cardinality strictly greater than h then subsidizing the corresponding set of subset nodes in our constructed budgeted maximum conversion instance would give a subsidy set of size at most k which permanently converts strictly more than h element dummy pairs for any subsidy of length at least 3 time steps the element nodes of each such pair would be converted in the second time step the dummy nodes of each such pair in the third time step this contradicts the optimality of o for the constructed instance thus a black box for budgeted maximum conversion gives a polynomial time algorithm to solve the budgeted maximum coverage instance exactly thus budgeted maximum conversion for arbitrary d 3 inherits 1 1 e hardness from the budgeted maximum coverage problem this hardness holds unless p np see 9
