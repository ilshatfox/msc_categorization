approximate pareto fronts to multiobjective optimization problems by two sided approximations one from inside and another from outside of the feasible objective set called respectively lower shell and upper shell we worked there under the assump tion that for a given problem an upper shell exists as it is not always the case in this paper we give some sufficient conditions for the existence of upper shells we also investigate how to constructively search infeasible sets to derive upper shells we approach this issue by means of problem relaxations we formally show that under certain conditions some subsets of lower shells to relaxed multiobjective optimization problems are upper shells in the respective unrelaxed problems results are illustrated by a numerical example

subset of the fea sible set is a lower we mean feasible discrete approximation of the efficient set such subsets if containing no dominated in the sense of pareto elements are called lower shells when coupled with dual constructs namely upper shells lower and up per shells produce via objective function mappings the so called two sided pareto front approximations 1 in inexact mo two sided pareto front appro ximations enable a natural qualitative definition of global pareto optimum the global pareto optimum is reached if a two sided pareto front approximation is known with its lower and upper part close enough various metrics has been proposed to each other 1 this definition can be quantified as mo problem contexts dictate roughly speaking an upper shell a finite set approximates the efficient set from outside of the feasible set it is required that no element of the upper shell is dominated by any element of the efficient set a natural prerequisite for any pareto front i e the image of the efficient set under the objective function mapping approximation of that kind but this means that verification of that requirement necessitates the knowledge of the efficient set hence the definition of upper shell is not in general operational a weaker notion is upper approximation a finite set an upper approx imation is defined with respect to a given lower shell the aforementioned requirement for upper shells no element of the upper shell is dominated by any element of the efficient set is weakened to the requirement that no ele ment of the upper approximation is dominated by any element of that given lower shell in consequence the definition of upper approximation becomes operational however such a weakening may cause that some elements of an upper approximation are dominated by some elements of the efficient set definitely a harmful property it is of interest then to identify instances in which up per approximations coincide with upper shells and such instances have been identified in this paper in our earlier works 1 2 where we were concerned with algorithmic issues of the derivation of lower shells and upper shells we worked under the assump tion that for a given problem an upper shell exists however an upper shell not always exists see example in section 7 a number of problems where no upper shell exists have been identified 3 4 therefore the problem of exis tence of upper shells deserves consideration in this work we give sufficient conditions for an upper shell to exist 1 by an analogy to singleobjective optimization where local optimum is not neces sarily the true global optimum the majority of inexact mo methods solve mo problems locally i e not necessarily solutions they provide are true pareto optima true pareto fronts this as a consequence of method inexactness but such solutions can be regarded as solutions to the problem only if they satisfy the above definition of global pareto optimum on upper approximations of pareto fronts 3 another issue is how to search the infeasible set to derive upper shells we approach that issue by means of problem relaxations we show that some sub sets of lower shells in relaxed mo problems are upper shells in the respective unrelaxed problems the practical importance of lower and upper shells lies in that they en able calculation of lower and upper bounds on values of objective functions for any implicit efficient solution an implicit efficient solution is an efficient solution which can be derived by solving a scalarized mo problem but as long as the problem is not solved it remains unknown 2 5 in calculations of upper bounds on objective function values upper shells can be replaced by upper approximations if it is known that they coincide this paves the way for approximate inexact computations with controlled accuracy in mo with applications to multiple criteria decision making 2 5 this fact is the main motivation of our research presented here we would like to identify conditions under which upper bounds on values of objective functions can be calculated any lower shell enables calculation of lower bounds thus our results pre sented below are of existential type considerations relating to quality issues of two sided pareto front approximations have been discussed in 1 2 the outline of the paper is as follows section 2 relates our work to the relevant literature of the field in section 3 we present preliminaries in section 4 we identify instances in which upper approximations coincide with upper shells in section 5 we show how upper approximations whenever they exist can be derived by relaxations of mo problems whereas in section 6 we discuss invariance of upper approximations under order invariant transformations of objectives in section 7 we give sufficient conditions for existence of upper shells and in section 8 we present an application of these results to a practical problem section 9 concludes 2 related works the need for pareto front pf approximations was realized in the mo com munity early following 7 approximation concepts can be divided into those based on exact mo methods and inexact ones i e all kinds of heuristics evolutionary computations including according to the classification scheme proposed in 7 0 th order approximations are discrete pointwise approxima tions and consist of a number usually limited of elements of pfs generated by a solution method higher order approximations consist of some constructs built on those elements cf e g 6 the survey 7 concentrates on exact methods and covers the period of 1975 2005 since 2005 other approximation concepts based on exact methods have been proposed 8 9 10 12 13 14 in 8 9 the efficient set is approximated from inside of the feasible set by solving series of optimization problems the approach has been recently refined in 10 by an application of the decom position principle the method proposed in 11 12 interpolates a number of elements of the pareto front and this interpolation gives rise to a mixed inte 4 i kaliszewski j miroforidis ger linear surrogate problem properties of pareto set approximations once they are given are investigated in 13 in the same work a method to derive pareto set approximations with the lipschitz type information extending earlier works in that direction 15 is given a statistical model kriging is applied in 14 to facilitate feasible solution set sampling in a quest for the pareto front all those works provide higher than 0 th order approximations of higher that 0 th order approximations are also those which hybridize exact and inexact approaches 8 9 all those methods also explicitly or implicitly assume with an exception for 13 that the feasible set has interior thus excluding combinatorial problems from considerations however works on pf approximations in discrete combinatorial prob lems are also represented in the literature in 16 definitions of lower and upper bound sets which coincide with the definition of lower shell and is quite close to the definition of upper shell used in this work is introduced in the context of multiobjective knapsack problem with integer variables solved via dynamic programming approximations of the pareto front for the general case no assumption on the problem considered based on deriving efficient elements by solving mo problems scalarized by the chebyshev function are proposed in 17 in 18 the idea of lower and upper bound sets is applied to multiobjective combinatorial problems bound sets are derived by solving a number of scalarized problems the same approach as in 13 15 is applied to mixed integer nonlinear problems in 19 recently an idea of cover sets based on the dominance relation to represent pfs has been elaborated in 20 in 21 lower and upper shells were applied to provide bounds on optimal solutions to biobjective knapsack problems in cases commercial mixed integer programming solvers like cplex hit time or memory limits in all those works with no exception no attempt is made to exploit infor mation which is provided by some specific infeasible solutions in contrast to that in this work we follow the other course namely we are interested in appro ximations based exclusively on inexact mo methods to ensure generality of the course no assumption is made on whether the feasible set has interior we have been inspired by the success story of population based methods 22 23 in the mo domain customarily termed evolutionary multiobjective opti mization emo when applied to a wide range of practical problems cf e g 24 25 26 27 28 29 population based methods though by their nature inex act have gained much popularity in application oriented communities which have no problem with accepting suboptimal solutions in exchange for method generality versatility and simplicity allowing easy in house codings following the classification given in 7 one can perceive emo methods as population based 0 th order approximations however with the distinction that emo methods as a rule produce lower we mean feasible approximations of pfs with no guarantee that they include any pf elements by this in contrast to approximations based on exact methods emo methods have no built in secure anchors in pfs without knowing at least some elements of the pf there is no trustworthy measure of accuracy of emo approximations this fact inspired the authors to investigate the possibility to provide two sided pf on upper approximations of pareto fronts 5 approximations which give rise to such measures 1 2 3 4 the authors are aware of only one work in which a similar reasoning is present 30 however in that work two sided approximations were not generated intentionally as the authors pursuit in their works another reason why we focus on approximations based on inexact mo methods is that such methods seem to rise less concerns to the question of scalability than their exact mo method based counterparts in population based approximations we have no formal constructs to recalculate update except objective functions or a fitness function built on them so it seems that in large multiobjective optimization problems the curse of dimensionality will trouble the exact mo methods and exact method based approximations to a much larger extent than the population based approximations 3 preliminaries consider the mo problem max f x x x 0 1 where x 0 rn is a compact i e closed and bounded set f rn rk f f 1 fk fl rn r l 1 k k 2 fl are objective functions max denotes the operator of deriving the set denoted n of efficient as defined below elements of x 0 we assume that n is not empty below we will use the following notation p f n z f x 0 feasible objective set rk y rk yl 0 l 1 k set p is called pareto front dominance relation on rn is defined as x x f x f x where denotes fl x fl x l 1 k and fl x fl x for at least one l elements x of x 0 for which there exists no x x 0 such that x x are called efficient in subsequent sections we will refer to the concept of lower shell and upper shell already presented in a series of publications 1 2 3 4 lower shell is a finite nonempty set sl x 0 elements of which satisfy x sl 6 x sl x x 2 the condition 2 ensures that a lower shell does not contain redundant in the sense of the dominance relation elements no element of sl is dominated by any other element of this set in terms of relations set sl consists only of elements which are maximal to relation in 11 sets satisfying 2 have been called inherently nondominated 6 i kaliszewski j miroforidis element ynad is defined as ynadl min x n fl x l 1 k upper shell is a finite nonempty set su rn x 0 elements of which satisfy x su 6 x su x x 3 x su 6 x n x x 4 x su ynad f x 5 condition 3 ensures that an upper shell does not contain redundant in the sense of the dominance relation elements no element of su dominates any other element of this set condition 4 ensures that no element of an upper shell is dominated by an element of set n i e by an efficient element condition 5 precludes inclusion into upper shells elements which in no circumstances can dominate an element of n element ynad sl is defined as ynadl sl min x sl fl x l 1 k given a lower shell sl upper approximation is a finite nonempty set au rn x 0 elements of which satisfy x au 6 x au x x 6 x au 6 x sl x x 7 x au ynad sl f x 8 condition 6 plays the same role as condition 3 condition 7 and condition 8 are consequences of the fact that in general set n is not known remark 1 an upper shell is an upper approximation the opposite statement does not hold hence a problem with no upper approximation possesses no upper shell intuitively upper approximations are meaningful only if sl n with 0 sufficiently small but such an intuition is valid only for sets with interior in the case of discrete sets one should rather work with upper shells on upper approximations of pareto fronts 7 4 mo instances where upper approximations are upper shells lower shells are meant to be one sided representations of n from inside of the feasible set similarly upper shells and upper approximations are meant to be one sided representations of n from outside of the feasible set the following lemmas identify cases where condition 7 implies condi tion 4 hence upper approximation au is an upper shell su no assumption about the nature of the underlying problem such as continuity discreetness convexity or connectivity is made here remark 2 the dominance relation x x holds f x 6 f x and f x f x rk lemma 1 an upper approximation au is an upper shell only if au x f x int rk p rk proof the proof follows as an immediate consequence of the definition of upper shell and remark 2 remark 3 sets x f x int rk p rk and x f x p rk are disjoint figure 1 and figure 2 give a graphical interpretation of lemma 1 fig 1 an illustration to lemma 1 the discrete case bullets elements of p 8 i kaliszewski j miroforidis fig 2 an illustration to lemma 1 the continuous case thick line p lemma 2 an upper approximation is an upper shell only if z f x f x f au rk proof since z p rk the assertion of the lemma follows from lemma 1 and remark 3 ut lemma 3 any subset of the inverse image of any set in p int rk elements of which satisfy condition 3 and condition 5 is a valid upper shell proof the proof follows immediately from the definition of upper shell lemma 3 relates the concept of upper shells and upper approximations to works on higher than 0 th order pf approximations mentioned in intro duction with hyperplanes as the simplest construct indeed any construct in p int rk which satisfies lemma 3 is an upper shell however in this work we are concerned with 0 th order pointwise pf approximations lemma 1 3 give no specific guidelines how to select au from rn x 0 to satisfy the respective assumptions for au su to hold in general this issue has to be investigated for each mo problem individually however there are classes of problems with the property that any subset of the infeasible set containing no dominating elements is an upper shell we discuss this in section 7 now we turn to the problem of derivation of upper approximations 5 derivation of upper approximations usually it is not known which part of rn x 0 should be searched for elements of au however upper approximations can be derived from some relaxations of problem 1 as shown by lemma 4 on upper approximations of pareto fronts 9 let x 0 x 0 rn consider the problem max f x x x 0 9 with the set of efficient elements n let sl denote a lower shell for problem 1 and s l denote a lower shell for problem 9 lemma 4 let s l and let elements x of satisfy x 6 x 0 10 x 6 x sl x x 11 ynad sl f x 12 then is an upper approximation for problem 1 proof by condition 10 rn x 0 moreover since is a subset of s l by the definition of lower shell formula 2 x 6 x x x i e satisfies condition 6 by condition 11 satisfies condition 7 by condition 12 satisfies condition 8 hence satisfies the definition of upper approximation ut 6 invariance of approximations considerations of this section apply to upper approximations as well as to lower shells let us consider problem 1 with f x replaced by some f x i e the problem max f x x x 0 13 we say that lower shells upper approximations are problem invariant if every lower shell upper approximation to problem 1 is a lower shell an upper approximation to problem 13 lemma 5 let for each l 1 k fl x and f l x generate the same linear order on r then lower shells and upper approximations are problem invari ant 10 i kaliszewski j miroforidis proof the proof follows from the fact that since for each l 1 k fl x and f l x generate the same linear order on r f x and f x generate the same dominance relation since both problems have the same set x 0 every lower shell in problem 1 satisfies the definition of lower shell in problem 13 the same is true for the upper approximation part of the lemma ut by lemma 5 under specified conditions two sided approximations in prob lem 1 which could have been derived with a significant computational effort are with no change two sided approximations in problem 13 to stress the importance of the concept of invariance of approximations it is worth mentioning that in a similar manner invariance of the efficient set n was investigated in 31 and successfully exploited in multiobjective optimization of radiotherapy planning in 32 from the latter work we learn that out of many functions proposed to measure the so called tumor control probability in organs to be protected against excessive radiation one has the form as follows geud d 1 v v j 1 daj 1 a 14 where dj is radiation dose deposited in voxel an element of a 3 d mesh j v is the number of voxels in the protected organ a is a parameter 1 a since all dj are nonnegative as physics dictates clearly this function and the linear function geud d 1 v v j 1 dj 15 produce with other objective functions unchanged the same efficient set n by the same argument lemma 5 both functions produce with other objec tive functions unchanged invariant lower shells and invariant upper approxi mations since in optimization problems related to oncological radiology the number of voxels depend on the mesh resolution and can reach hundreds of thousands a simple function replacement can result in significant savings in computation load 2 7 identification of problems with upper shells in this section we investigate existence of upper shells as mentioned already there exist problems without upper shells this fact is illustrated by the fol lowing example 2 the average speed up when calculating the value of function 15 instead of function 14 averaged over 20 000 calculations a 3 on an off the shelf laptop ranges 23 on upper approximations of pareto fronts 11 fig 3 an example of problem with no upper shell with x 0 x 0 specified as in example 1 the curve represents f n for x 0 and at the same time f n for any x 0 defined as in 17 example 1 let us consider the following problem max f x f 1 x x 1 3 2 x 2 4 2 f 2 x x 1 4 2 x 2 1 2 x 0 x 1 x 1 5 1 x 2 5 16 and its relaxation max f x f 1 x x 1 3 2 x 2 4 2 f 2 x x 1 4 2 x 2 1 2 x 0 x a x 1 b a x 2 b a 1 b 5 17 the pareto fronts of problem 16 and all its relaxations are represented in figure 3 and they are all the same with the maximum for f 1 x at x 3 4 where f 3 4 0 10 and the maximum for f 2 x at x 4 1 where f 4 1 10 0 the only region of rn where one function increases and the other decreases is defined by x f 1 x 10 f 2 x 0 f 1 x 0 f 2 x 10 x 0 thus the problem 16 has no upper shell however problem 16 can be hardly regarded a constrained problem its two objective functions attain their maxima inside the feasible set usually problems which emerge from applications are constrained by a sort of budget constraint s witnessing limited resources monetary or physical and preclud ing objective functions attaining optima inside the feasible sets in that sense problem 16 becomes a constrained problem for e g x 0 x 1 5 x 1 2 5 1 5 x 2 2 5 in general identification of problems having upper shells is far from being trivial however in some instances the existence of upper shells is relatively simple to ascertain we recall that a function rn r is called strongly monotonically increasing on rn if x x x 6 x implies x x 33 12 i kaliszewski j miroforidis let us observe that condition 4 is equivalent to 6 x su x n x x 18 lemma 6 let objective function f l l 1 k be strongly monotoni cally increasing on rn then x x 0 and x x implies x 6 x proof for any element x of x 0 and any element x such that x x and for strongly monotonically increasing function f l we have fl x fl x thus x 6 x lemma 7 let objective function f l l 1 k be strongly monoton ically increasing on rn then x n x rn x 0 and x x implies x 6 x proof since n x 0 by lemma 6 x 6 x elements x such that x rn x 0 and x x exist since x 0 is compact ut lemma 7 shows how to select condidates for upper shells which satisfy condition 18 or equivalently condition 4 below we shall make use of a stronger condition namely x su x n x x 19 elements of su which satisfy the above condition satisfy also condition 5 lemma 8 let all objective functions fl l 1 k be strongly monotoni cally increasing on rn then x x 0 and x x implies x x proof the proof is an immediate consequence of the assertion that all objective functions are strongly monotonically increasing on rn lemma 9 let all objective functions fl l 1 k be strongly monoton ically increasing on rn then x n and x x implies x x and x rn x 0 proof since n x 0 by lemma 8 x x suppose x x 0 but this contradicts the assumption that x n hence x rn x 0 ut lemma 8 shows how to select candidates for upper shells which satisfy condition 18 and condition 5 or equivalently condition 4 and condition 5 the condition in lemma 8 and lemma 9 that all objective functions are strongly monotonically increasing cannot be relaxed as illustrated in figure 4 dashed lines are contours of strongly monotonically increasing objective function f 1 dotted lines are contours of objective function f 2 which is not strongly monotonically increasing the thick line shows set n function f 1 attains its maximum at x and function f 2 attains its maximum at x thus x n and x n elements x 1 x 2 satisfy x x however neither x 1 rn x 0 nor x x 1 holds and x 2 rn x 0 holds but not x x 2 figure 5 on upper approximations of pareto fronts 13 fig 4 an example illustrating why the assumption in lemma 8 and in lemma 9 that all objective functions are strongly monotonically increasing cannot be relaxed fig 5 an example illustrating why the assumption in lemma 8 and in lemma 9 that all objective functions are strongly monotonically increasing cannot be relaxed the situation in the space of objective function values represents this situation in the space of objective function values analogous drawings can be made for any strongly monotonically increasing function and any set x 0 lemma 9 is of the existential type since set n is in general unknown however there is a class of mo problems defined in lemma 1 in which x x 0 x rn x 0 and x x implies x x thus any subset of elements x rn x 0 which satisfy g x b x x for some x x 0 and condition 3 is a valid upper shell theorem 1 let all objective functions fl l 1 k be strongly mono tonically increasing on rn let one of the conditions defining x 0 be of the form g x b 14 i kaliszewski j miroforidis fig 6 an illustration to theorem 1 and let g x be strongly monotonically increasing on rn then x x 0 and x x g x b and x x implies x x proof any element x such that g x b belongs to rn x 0 for any element x of x 0 and any element x of rn x 0 such that x x and for strongly monotonically increasing functions fl x l 1 k we have fl x fl x elements x such that x rn x 0 and x x exist since x 0 is compact thus x x ut theorem 1 is illustrated in figure 6 dashed and dotted lines are the con tours of the strongly monotonically increasing functions f 1 and f 2 dashed thick line is the contour of the strongly monotonically increasing function g x for all infeasible elements x x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 relation x x for some x x 0 holds this time no information on n is assumed figure 7 represents this situation in the space of objective function values theorem 1 is constructive if the assumptions of the lemma hold any subset of elements x rn x 0 which satisfy g x b x x for some x x 0 and condition 3 is a valid upper shell linear multiobjective and linear mixed integer problems with positive co efficients in objective and constraint functions and type constraints are the simplest examples of problems which fall to this class the property persists if linear functions are replaced by any strongly monotonically increasing func tion as already mentioned above this property has been exploited in the context of biobjective multidimensional knapsack problems 21 but the ap proach is directly extendable to any number of criteria 8 a numerical example consider the mo modeling problem a round beam with mass and deflection as objective functions 34 on upper approximations of pareto fronts 15 fig 7 an illustration to theorem 1 the situation in the space of objective function values the mo problem max f d g f 1 d g d g g l f 2 d g 4 fl 3 3 e d 2 g 4 d 4 x 0 d g 8 fl d 2 g d 2 g 4 d 4 kg 0 d 0 1 0 001 g 0 1 where f 1 d g mass kg f 2 d g deflection m d internal diameter m g wall thickness m f 104 bending force n l 3 beam length m 7 86 103 material density kgm 3 e 2 1 1011 young modulus pa kg 150 106 maximal bending stress pa to remain consistent with the problem formulation 1 and the definition of the dominance relation we maximize f 1 d g and f 2 d g the second objective function is strongly monotonically increasing on r 2 but the first is not thus in this case an upper shell has been succesfully con structed by the combination of lemma 7 and the relaxation approach lemma 4 16 i kaliszewski j miroforidis fig 8 the image f sl of a lower shell sl for the numerical example of section 8 mass horizontal axis it is also worth observing that by lemma 5 replacement of the second objective function by f 2 d g 4 fl 3 e d 2 g 4 d 4 leaves the efficient set n unchanged fig 9 the image f au of an upper approximation au for the numerical example of section 8 mass horizontal axis here au satisfies the definition of upper shell on upper approximations of pareto fronts 17 figure 6 and figure 7 present examples of a lower shell and an upper approximation represented by the objective function mapping they were derived by the algorithm described in 2 9 concluding remarks the results presented in the paper are inspired by attempts to provide tools for solving large and computationally expensive mo problems as already said with a pair of a lower shell sl and an upper shell su it is possible to approximate selected efficient elements of x 0 with controllable accuracy 1 2 in consequence in the full analogy to singleobjective optimization this enables stopping computations whenever satisfactory approximation accuracy is reached we have shown that with a rather mild conditions on problem 1 there exist elements which form upper approximations to that problem we have also shown that some problem modifications if admissible guar antee that upper approximations have properties of upper shells this adds to the fact that there are instances of problem 1 where this is always the case for example multidimensional knapsack and multidimensional multiple choice knapsack problems set covering after a suitable transformation and set packing problems have this feature if infeasible x are confined to 0 1 n identification of other classes of problems for which upper approximations have properties of upper shells will be the subject of our further research lemma 5 can be particularly useful in large scale computations where the cost of computing f x becomes a limiting factor lower shells and upper approximations can be derived with functions f l x which generate the same linear order as functions fl x but of lower computing cost linear functions and polynomial functions when defined on appropriate domains can serve here as the simplest example one might rightly argue that a natural vehicle to implement the concept of the two sided pareto front approximations is evolutionary multiobjective optimization as presented e g in the monographs 22 23 and numerous pa pers published on the subject moreover in our earlier papers 1 2 3 5 34 we have made use of this vehicle however seeing emo as a natural but not necessarily the only mechanism to populate pf approximations in this work we purposely have not related directly our results to that specific kind of heuristics because they are applicable to heuristics to derive lower and upper shells of any sort references 1
