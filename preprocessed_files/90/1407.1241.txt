romania email zalinesc uaic ro abstract in this short note we give characterizations for objective sets and objective functions as defined in d y gao and c wu s paper arxiv 1104 2970 v 2 1 objective sets and objective functions in 12 one can read the following mathematical definitions of the objective set and objective function are given in the book 9 chapter 6 page 288 let q q rm m qt q 1 detq 1 be a proper orthogonal rotation group definition 1 objectivity and isotropy a subset ya r m is said to be objective if qy ya y ya and q q a real valued function t ya r is said to be objective if its domain is objective and t qy t y y ya and q q 2 a subset ya r m is said to be isotropic if yqt ya y ya and q q a real valued function t ya r is said to be isotropic if its domain is isotropic and t yqt t y y ya and q q 3 the reference 9 above is our reference 4 because q is an m m orthogonal matrix in order to calculate qy for y rm one must consider y as a column vector of course qt is also an m m matrix because we don t know what is meant by yqt in such a case in the sequel we deal only with objective sets and objective functions in the sense mentioned above let us also see how these notions are defined in definition 6 1 2 in 4 definition 6 1 2 objectivity and isotropy d 1 objective set and objective function a subset aa m is said to be objective if for every a aa and every q m ort qa aa a scalar valued function u aa r is said to be objective if its domain is objective and u x qa u x a a aa q m ort 6 20 d 2 isotropic set and isotropic function a subset aa m is said to be isotropic if for every a aa and every q m ort also aq t aa a scalar valued function u aa r is said to be isotropic if its domain is isotropic and u x aqt u x a a aa q m ort 6 21 the set m appearing in 4 def 6 1 2 as well as a set a are defined on page 287 of 4 we use the notation m rm n or simply m to denote the space of all second order tensor functions with domain in rn and range in rm n let a m be an admissible deformation gradient space defined by 1 http arxiv org abs 1407 1241 v 3 http arxiv org abs 1104 2970 a a m ranka x min m n x 6 16 for us definition 6 1 2 is not sufficiently clear because aa does not seem to be an objective set this is the reason to use definition 1 for our characterization of objective sets and objective functions observe that in the first version of 12 one finds another definition of an objective function which doesn t seem to be equivalent to that in definition 1 above indeed in 10 one can read by the fact that this potentially useful theory is based on certain fundamental principles in physics the nonconvex termw x is required to be an objective function i e there exists a geometrically nonlinear mapping xa v r m and a canonical function v v rm r such that w x v x x xa almost the same text can be found in 11 p 118 1 2 characterizations of objective sets and objective functions in the sequel rm m 1 is endowed with the usual inner product and the elements of rm are considered as being m 1 matrices let set qm q rm m qtq im detq 1 lemma 1 let m 2 and u v sm 1 x rm x 1 then there exists q qm such that qu v proof consider first the case m 2 then there exist 0 2 such that u cos sin t v cos sin t taking q 2 cos sin sin cos clearly q 2 q 2 and v q 2 u if m 3 take x r m a linear subspace containing u v then consider a orthonormal basis e 1 e 2 em in r m with e 1 e 2 x with respect to this basis take q of the form q q 2 0 0 im 2 where q 2 is defined as above and ik is the identity matrix of order k it is clear that q qm and qu v proposition 2 let m 2 a rm a nonempty set and f a e i a is objective if and only if there exists r a nonempty set such that a sm 1 tx t x sm 1 ii f is objective if and only if there exist r a nonempty set and a function e such that a sm 1 and f x x for every x a iii every nonempty subset b of r is objective and any function g b e is objective 1 this paper is contained in the file http www confmame ru documents pdf p 1 mame iv pdf 2 http www confmame ru documents pdf p 1 mame iv pdf proof i let first have a sm 1 with r nonempty consider x a and q qm then x u with and u s m 1 it follows that qx qu since qtq im we get qu 2 qu tqu utqtqu ut imu u tu u 2 1 whence qu sm 1 hence qx sm 1 a assume now that a is objective and set x x a r clearly a sm 1 consider x sm 1 that is x u with and u sm 1 since there exists y a such that y if 0 then 0 y a whence x 0 0 a assume that 6 0 then v 1 y sm 1 by lemma 1 there exists q qm such that u qv it follows that x u qv qy since a is objective it follows that x a hence a sm 1 ii assume first that there exist r a nonempty set with a s m 1 and a function e such that f x x for every x a hence a is objective by i since qx x for every q qm it is clear that f is objective conversely assume that f is objective by the very definition a is objective and so by i there exists r a nonempty set such that a s m 1 fix some u 0 s m 1 and take e defined by t f tu 0 consider x a then x if 0 then x 0 u 0 and so f x f u 0 x assume that 0 then u 1 x sm 1 by lemma 1 there existsq qm such that u qu 0 whence x q u 0 since f is objective it follows that f x f q u 0 f u 0 t x iii clearly q 1 1 i 1 the conclusion follows corollary 3 let m 2 and h rm m consider a rm a nonempty set such that a 6 0 and f a r defined by f x xthx then f is objective if and only if there exist 6 r and r such that a s m 1 and 1 2 h ht im proof setting hs 1 2 h ht we have that f x xthsx for x a so we may and do assume that h hs the sufficiency is obvious because by proposition 2 i a is objective and f x x 2 for x a hence f is objective by proposition 2 ii with t t 2 assume that f is objective by proposition 2 ii there exist 6 r and r such that a sm 1 and f x x for x a fixing u 0 s m 1 for t 0 0 we have that t 0 f t 0 u 0 f t 0 u t 0 u th t 0 u t 2 0 uthu t 2 0 u sm 1 where ut 0 hu 0 it follows u thu ut imu for every u r m and so hs h im the proof is complete 3 further remarks 1 on the webpage https en wikipedia org wiki radial function one finds the fol lowing definition a radial function is a function defined on a euclidean space rn whose value at each point depends only on the distance between that point and the origin contin ued by a function is radial if and only if it is invariant under all rotations leaving the origin fixed that is f is radial if and only if f f for all so n the special orthogonal group in n dimensions as reference it is mentioned stein weiss book 19 p 33 clearly so n is nothing else than qn this shows that proposition 2 ii is a somewhat more precise description of radial functions 3 https en wikipedia org wiki radial function 2 latorre gao in 15 p 1765 and jin gao 13 p 169 say any convex quadratic function is objective while gao ruan latorre in 8 p np 9 and 9 p 7 say clearly any convex quadratic function w is objective due to the cholesky decomposition a 0 therefore these authors claim the following claim 1 gao et al any convex quadratic function is objective to understand what d y gao and his collaborators mean by a quadratic function let us quote from 16 pp np 54 np 55 and 17 p 160 in many applications the geometrical operator is usually a vector valued quadratic function x x x 1 2 x bkx x bk dk 1 2 x csx x cs es where bk r n and bk r n n is a given symmetric matrix for each k 1 2 p cs r n for each s 1 2 q cs r n n is a given positive definite matrix for each s 1 2 q d rp and e rq consequently this text shows that d y gao accepts as myself that a quadratic function on rn is a function q rn r defined by q x 1 2 x cx x d e with c rn n symmetric d rn and e r being the usual inner product on rn using claim 1 we get claim 2 any linear function on rn is objective of course claim 2 contradicts the following assertion from 6 p 3 an objective function must be nonlinear coming back to claim 1 consider n 2 and the function qd r n r defined by qd x x 2 x d for a fixed d rn clearly qd is convex and quadratic it is obtained taking c in d r n and e 0 2 assuming that claim 1 is true it follows that for all q qn we have x 2 x qt d qx 2 qx d qd qx qd x x 2 x d x rn and so x qtd x d for x rn hence qtd d for all q qn fix k 2 n and consider qk r n n whose elements are defined as follows qij 0 for i j 1 n i 6 j q 11 qkk 1 qii 1 for i 2 n k of course qk q t k and detqk 1 hence qk qn from q t k d d we get 2 d 1 2 dk 0 and so di 0 for every i 1 n this shows that d 0 therefore claim 1 is false for n 2 and d 6 0 in fact using corollary 3 we get fact 1 a quadratic function q rn r n 2 is objective if and only if there exists r such that q x x 2 for all x rn 3 d y gao provides the following result in 5 lemma 1 a real valued function w w is objective if and only if there exists a real valued function e such that w w wtw without proof or reference notice that the first version of the present note http arxiv org abs 1407 1241 is mentioned in the bibliography of the third version of 5 as reference 68 but not cited in connection with lemma 1 4 jin gao in 13 p 171 say 2 we could take c 0 n the null element of r n n 4 http arxiv org abs 1407 1241 according to the definition of the objectivity a nonconvex function w y r is objective if and only if there exists a function v y y r such that w y v yt y 4 17 excepting 4 17 the same text can be found in 14 p 205 in 13 4 and 17 are our references 3 and 5 respectively it is clear that the reference 17 that is 5 see also remark 3 above is not adequate for the representation w y v yt y of an objective function in fact it is not possible to speak about v yt y for a function v y y r the term yt y suggests that y is an element of rn rn 1 for some positive integer n and so yt y r surely yt y cannot be an element of y y 5 in 6 p 3 gao says according to 10 g g is an objective function if and only if there exists an objective measure gtg and a real valued function such that g g gtg the reference 10 from the above text is 3 moreover the characterization of an objective function by using the representation g g gtg is nothing else than 5 lem 1 see remark 3 above 6 d y gao and his collaborators like to assert claim 3 the objectivity is not an assumption but an axiom claim 3 is attributed explicitly to ciarlet 3 in 15 p 1765 it is emphasized in recent book by ciarlet 3 that the objectivity is not an assumption but an axiom see also 7 p 6 5 p 3 1 p np 141 8 p np 8 13 p 169 2 p 293 9 p 7 however 18 p np 197 is an exception here it is said it was emphasized in 10 that the objectivity is not an assumption but an axiom where 10 is ruan n and gao dy canonical duality approach for nonlinear dynamical systems ima j appl math 2014 79 2 313 325 notice that 3 is mentioned in 18 as reference 20 probably 10 in it was emphasized in 10 is a misprint having in view that the string object can be found only two times in reference 10 of 18 it appears in the text the optimal objective function value from pages 322 and 323 of 10 having in view the texts reproduced from 15 p 1765 and 6 p 3 we hoped to find the strings objectivity and objective function in the book 3 we were very disappointed because the string objectiv can be found in 3 only in the word objective and this one used with its usual meaning of aim or scope at pages 1 76 193 312 394 412 437 572 606 653 675 682 711 763 the objective of this 50 our main objective in this 61 the first objective of this 64 446 492 our objective is to 98 514 the objective is to 142 423 our objective then consists 241 the objective consists 248 the ideal objective in this respect this objective is unattainable 249 the above ideal objective 479 these objectives will be achieved 523 our basic objective is to 540 our first objective is to 637 our objective in this 657 our more modest objective in this 726 two objectives are achieved 7 as seen in remarks 4 and 5 the representation of objective functions as in 5 lem 1 is attributed to 3 too something related to such a representation can be found at page 695 of 3 remarks 1 it can be shown that the axiom of material frame indifference implies that as a function of f m 3 the stored energy function is in fact a function of f tf s 3 where s 3 denotes the set of all symmetric positive definite symmetric matrices of order three in 5 other words there exists a function w s 3 r such that at each x w x f w x ftf for all f m 3 it therefore follows that w x x w x x t x at each x where x t x s 3 is none other than the metric tensor at x associated with the deformation section 8 2 also called in elasticity theory the cauchy green strain tensor at x so it is not possible to attribute to 3 the representation of a radial function from 13 p 171 or from 6 p 3 at least because the above remark from 3 p 695 refers to elements f m 3 and not to elements y belonging to an objective subset of r n as the domain of an objective function references 1 y chen d y gao retracted global solutions to spherically constrained quadratic minimization
