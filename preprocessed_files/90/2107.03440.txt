abstract this paper addresses the general problem of designing ordinal classification methods based on comparing actions with limiting boundaries of ordered classes categories the fundamental requirement of the method consists of setting a relational system d s where s and d are reflexive and transitive relations respectively s should be compatible with the order of the set of classes and d is a subset of s an asymmetric preference relation p is defined from s other requirements are imposed on the actions which compose the limiting boundaries between adjacent classes in such a way that each class is closed below and above the paper proposes s based and p based assignment procedures each of them is composed of two complementary assignment procedures which correspond through the transposition operation and should be used conjointly the methods work under several basic conditions on the set of limiting boundaries under other more demanding separability requirements each procedure fulfills the set of structural properties established for other outranking based ordinal classification methods our proposal avoids the conflict between the required correspondence through the transposition operation and the assignment of limiting actions to the classes to which they belong we thus propose very diverse s and p based ordinal classification approaches with desirable properties which can be designed by using decision models with the capacity to build preference relations fulfilling the basic requirements to s and d keywords multiple criteria analysis ordinal

introduction ordinal classification is a main topic in the field of multiple criteria decision making mcdm which has attracted attention from the mcdm community over the last decades unlike nominal classification in ordinal classification objects alternatives actions are assigned to ordered and pre defined classes or categories many multi criteria ordinal classification methods have been proposed in the mcdm literature the main differences among them are focused on a the underlying preference model and b the way in which classes are characterized regarding the decision maker s dm s preference model a vast majority of the methods comes from one of three main paradigms the functional paradigm based on the construction of value functions e g jacquet lagr ze 1995 zopounidis and doumpos 2000 symbolic methods connected with artificial intelligence e g greco et al 2001 and the relational paradigm e g massaglia and ostanello 1991 yu 1992 whatever the model of preferences classes should be characterized in some way there are two main ways i using limiting actions as boundaries between adjacent classes e g yu 1992 roy and bouyssou 1993 perny 1998 araz and ozkarahan 2007 nemery and lamboray 2008 ishizaka et al 2012 ii using decision examples or reference actions which are representative of the related classes and whose classification is or maybe known e g jacquet lagr ze 1995 zopounidis and doumpos 2000 greco et al 2001 k ksalan and ulu 2003 almeida dias et al 2010 2012 fernandez and navarro 2011 among the methods in point i the most popular one is is electre tri proposed by yu 1992 detailed by roy and bouyssou 1993 and renamed by almeida dias et al 2010 as electre tri b see govindan and jepsen 2016 for a summary of published applications of this method in electre tri b classes are characterized by introducing a single limiting action profile between adjacent classes which are closed from below in other words for adjacent classes the limiting action between them belongs to the upper category electre tri b uses outranking and preference relations to compare the actions with the limiting profiles actions are assigned according to the results of this comparison electre tri b consists of two alternative procedures which are based on two different logics the pseudo conjunctive procedure uses an outranking relation whereas the pseudo disjunctive procedure exploits an asymmetric preference relation both assignment rules fulfil several fundamental properties conformity monotonicity stability homogeneity independence and uniqueness which are a paradigm for outranking based ordinal classification methods the procedures can be used alternatively according to the logic with which the decision maker dm feels more comfortable both procedures could be used conjointly although there are no theoretical arguments to justify it the pseudo conjunctive procedure has received more attention than the other one the pseudo conjunctive method has been axiomatically addressed by bouyssou and marchant 2007 and most of the electre tri b applications have been performed by using this procedure the original electre tri evolved in different directions almeida dias et al 2010 2012 proposed the electre tri c and tri nc methods in which categories are described by representative or characteristic actions if rk denotes the set of representative actions of class ck in order to assign an action x electre tri nc tri c is a particular case exploits an outranking relation s between actions and representative sets of classes the method uses a descending respectively ascending procedure based on finding the first ck for which xsrk resp rksx due to the symmetry between both rules almeida dias et al 2010 2012 suggest that they should be used conjointly and the assignment may be an interval of classes such a symmetry has a deep meaning almeida dias et al 2010 argued that the ascending and descending procedures correspond via the transposition operation this operation consists of inverting the direction of preferences on all criteria also inverting the ordering of the classes according to bouyssou and marchant 2015 the conclusions obtained after this operation should not be different from the original conclusions it should be remarked that the assignment rules in electre tri b do not correspond via the transposition operation roy 2002 bouyssou and marchant 2015 this is a consequence of considering classes as closed from below bouyssou and marchant 2015 to enhance the definition of the limiting boundaries electre tri nb was recently proposed fern ndez et al 2017 in this enhanced method limiting boundaries between adjacent consecutive classes are characterized through several or many limiting profiles compared to electre tri b the electre tri nb uses a richer information about the relations between actions and limiting boundaries as in the original method in electre tri nb the classes keep closed from below both assignment rules fulfil the same set of structural properties and the procedures have no symmetry with respect to the transposition operation electre tri nb was extended to the interval framework by fern ndez et al 2020 in interclass nb criterion performances levels weights veto and majority thresholds may be interval numbers what permits an easy handle of imprecision uncertainty ill definition and arbitrariness other characteristics and properties are similar to electre tri b and tri nb fern ndez et al 2020 a hierarchical electre tri b with interacting criteria was proposed by corrente et al 2016 ordinal classification problems can be solved in different levels of the hierarchy the fulfilment of the structural properties may be altered by interaction of criteria was not addressed by this paper bouyssou and marchant 2015 proposed an interesting and important ascending procedure based on an outranking relation s called the dual pseudo conjunctive electre tri b if bk denotes the limiting action between classes ck and ck 1 the dual pseudo conjunctive procedure bases the assignment of an action x on the fulfilment of bksx instead of xsbk as in the original renamed primal pseudo conjunctive procedure since both primal and dual procedures correspond via the transposition operation bouyssou and marchant 2015 support their conjoint use similarly to the ascending and descending rules in electre tri c in the proposal from bouyssou and marchant 2015 limiting profiles are interpreted as fictitious actions in the frontier of adjacent classes but belonging to no one this could make very difficult a direct elicitation of such fictitious profiles bouyssou and marchant 2015 suggested the use of indirect methods from the preference disaggregation analysis to elicit the limiting actions the profile bk is assigned to ck 1 respectively ck by the primal resp dual procedure hence the conformity property is not fulfilled and the fictitious character of the limiting actions is underlined bouyssou et al 2020 perform a complete and very interesting axiomatic characterization of the pseudo conjunctive electre tri nb they proved that the the electre tri nb pseudo conjunctive procedure is more general than the additive value function model for ordinal classification and suggest the use of a conjoint primal dual pseudo conjunctive approach having several or many limiting actions between consecutive classes the limiting actions do not belong to any class as in bouyssou and marchant 2015 thus after the paper by bouyssou and marchant 2015 a pair decision analyst decision maker interested in using electre tri b or a variant faces the following dilemma i to use the pseudo conjunctive procedure ii to use the pseudo disjunctive procedure iii to choose a combined use of both procedures and consider the interval of classes derived from this combination iv to choose the conjoint primal dual method by bouyssou and marchant 2015 in spite of the difficulty to set the limiting actions and the non fulfilment of the conformity property as stated before most of the published applications have used the single pseudo conjunctive procedure may be for its popularity for having a complete axiomatic foundation or for disposing of simpler indirect elicitation methods than the pseudo disjunctive procedure however the single use of the pseudo conjunctive procedure is asymmetric the information provided by xsbk and not xsbk 1 has no more value than the obtained from bksx and not bk 1 sx then why only xsbk and not xsbk 1 should be taken into account the conjoint use of both kinds of information should produce more informed assignments it is a central idea in support of the combined use of procedures with symmetry respect to the transposition operation nevertheless the set of structural properties including conformity of electre tri b should be kept roy 2002 and bouyssou and marchant 2015 identified a conflicting nature between the conformity property and the correspondence through the transposition operation roy 2002 prioritized the fulfillment of the conformity property whereas bouyssou and marchant 2015 and bouyssou et al 2020 privileged the consistency with the transposition operation in this paper we suggest a way to avoid such a contradiction redefining the limiting boundaries between adjacent classes we also attempt to generalize the main idea behind electre tri b its variants and other methods based on limiting profiles between adjacent classes consider any relation x is at least as good as y with respect to a certain desirable property or alternatively any relation x is preferred to y with respect to a certain desirable property there is no matter the way to create these relations suppose also that the pair dm decision analyst wants to use one of these relations to design a limiting boundary based assignment method to classes ordered in the sense of increasing in this paper we address the following fundamental issue to propose a general form of the decision rule and to identify the requirements on the limiting actions to fulfill i the entire set of structural properties originally suggested by roy and bouyssou 1993 and ii symmetry with respect to the transposition operation this general characterization is inspired by the primal and dual rules proposed by bouyssou and marchant 2015 but it is more general and satisfies the conformity property to achieve the compatibility with this property we require to introduce two layers of actions to describe each limiting boundary such an addition becomes more demanding the requirements on the set of limiting actions than the ones in electre tri nb nevertheless the methods still work under weaker requirements although lose some of the properties the paper is structured as follows an outranking based primal and dual method is discussed in section 2 including its properties an asymmetric preference based method is characterized in section 3 two examples illustrating the methods are presented in section 4 followed by a discussion section in which the generality of the proposal is underlined lastly some conclusions and lines of future research are presented in section 6 2 an outranking based primal and dual conjoint procedure this section introduces the basic requirements the new method and the structural properties it must fulfill 2 1 requirements some conditions and results on the relational system of preferences and the limiting actions must be established before the presentation of the method condition 1 requirements on the relational system of preferences 1 let us consider a pair of binary relations d s with the following characteristics d is a transitive relation xsy may be interpreted as action x has at least as much of certain desirable property as action y s is a reflexive relation from s an asymmetric preference relation p is defined as xpy xsy and not ysx d s must fulfill x y z a a a i xdy xsy ii xsy and ydz xsz iii xdy and ysz xsz proposition 1 properties of the combined use of p and d 1 under very general conditions at least as good as relations created by multi criteria decision methods and the pareto dominance relation fulfill this requirement under condition 1 the pair d p satisfies the following properties i xp y and ydz xpz ii xdy and ypz xpz proof proposition 1 i xp y and ydz xs y and ydz xsz condition 1 ii suppose that zsx then ydz and zsx ysx condition 1 iii this contradicts xpy hence not zsx finally xsz and not zsx xpz proposition 1 ii the proof follows the same logic as above but using first condition 1 iii next we present the requirements to the limiting profiles of an ordinal classification method based on a relational system which fulfills condition 1 condition 2 basic demands on limiting profiles consider a set of m ordered and predefined classes c c 1 ck cm m 2 ordered in the sense of increasing the boundary between ck and ck 1 is described by a set of limiting actions bk for k 1 m 1 each bk is composed of two disjoint subsets buk and blk such that i each w buk is in ck ii each z blk is in ck 1 iii there is no pair w z blk blk fulfilling wpz iv there is no pair w z buk buk fulfilling wpz condition 3 separability conditions i there is no pair w z buk blk fulfilling wsz ii there is no pair w z bk bh h k fulfilling wsz iii for each z buk there is y blk 1 such that zsy iv for each z blk there is y buk 1 such that ysz v for each z buk there is w buk 1 such that wdz vi for each z buk there is w buk 1 such that zdw vii for each z blk there is y blk 1 such that zdy viii for each z blk there is y blk 1 such that ydz condition 3 i is a separability condition between the subsets which compound each limiting boundary 3 ii viii are separability conditions between boundaries conditions 3 i 3 iv are s based separability requirements 3 v 3 viii are d based separability conditions let us remark that conditions 3 ii 3 iii and 3 iv arise naturally from the order of classes in the sense of increasing 2 2 the s based method the method is presented in the next three definitions definition 1 s relation between actions and boundaries a xsbk there is w blk such that xsw and there is no z bk fulfilling zpx b bksx there is w buk such that wsx and there is no z bk fulfilling xpz definition 2 s based primal assignment procedure set the relational system d s fulfilling condition 1 set bk k 1 m 1 fulfilling condition 2 assume that b 0 is the anti ideal action and xsb 0 for all x i for k m 1 0 find the first limiting boundary bk fulfilling xsbk ii take ck 1 as an acceptable class to assign x definition 3 s based dual assignment procedure set the relational system d s fulfilling condition 1 set bk k 1 m 1 fulfilling condition 2 assume that bm is the ideal action and bmsx for all x a for k 1 m find the first bk fulfilling bksx b take ck as an acceptable class to assign x remark 1 note that the primal and dual procedures correspond through the transposition operation they should be used conjointly in assigning actions note also that if buk is empty k 1 m 1 the primal rule under condition 2 ii iii and condition 3 ii vii and viii is equivalent to the pseudo conjunctive procedure of electre tri nb proposition 2 basic properties of the s relation between actions and limiting boundaries under conditions 1 2 and 3 v 3 viii the following properties are fulfilled i xsbk xsbh for k h ii bksx bhsx for h k see the proof in appendix a 2 3 structural properties of the s based procedures 2 we should prove that the s based primal and dual procedures satisfy the properties which were firstly proposed by roy and bouyssou 1993 for electre tri b these properties are fulfilled also by electre tri nb fern ndez et al 2017 and interclass nb fern ndez et al 2020 and as stated in the introduction are paradigmatic for outranking based ordinal classification methods let us recall after fern ndez et al 2017 2020 the definition of merging and splitting operations on the set of classes definition 4 merging and splitting operations a merging a merging operations puts together two consecutive categories ck and ck 1 by forming a new category denoted by c k this operation consists of removing the set of limiting profiles bk the new category c k is delimited by taking into account the lower set b k 1 and the upper set bk 1 the new boundaries are characterized in the following way b h b h for h 0 k 1 b h 1 bh for h k 1 m b splitting a splitting operation makes a separation of a category ck into two new adjacent categories c k and c k 1 this operation consists of adding a new boundary b k the elements of b k must fulfill conditions 2 and 3 the new sets are characterized as follows b h bh for h 0 k 1 b k b k and b h bh 1 for h k 1 m 1 definition 5 stability property a method is considered stable under the operations of definition 4 if and only if i after performing a merging or a splitting operation the actions belonging to a non modified category previously to the change will keep their assignments after such a 2 we keep the adjective structural used in almeida dias et al 2010 and fern ndez et al 2017 we make use also of the term consistency properties modification ii after performing a merging of two categories the actions belonging to the merged categories before merging are still belonging to the new category iii after performing a splitting operation of a category the actions belonging to the modified category before splitting are still belonging to one of the two new categories the s based primal and dual procedures fulfill a set of consistency properties described by the following three propositions proposition 3 properties under basic requirements under the basic requirements from condition 2 the s based primal and dual procedures fulfill the following properties i uniqueness each action is assigned to a unique class ii independence the assignment of an action does not depend on the assignment of the other actions iii homogeneity actions which compare the same way with respect to the limiting boundaries are assigned to the same class iv monotonicity ydx and x is classified into ck y is classified into ck with k k see the proof in appendix a remark 2 if s is transitive ysx and x belongs to class ck y belongs to ck with k k the proof is similar to the one for monotonicity replacing d by s see appendix a proposition 4 conformity under condition 2 and the s based separability conditions conditions 3 i 3 iv the s based primal and dual procedures fulfill a if x belongs to blk x is assigned to ck 1 b if x belongs to buk x is assigned to ck see the proof in appendix a proposition 5 stability property under condition 2 and the d based separability requirements conditions 3 v viii the s based primal and dual procedures are stable under merging and splitting operations see the proof in appendix a 3 a p based primal and dual procedures in several papers bouyssou and pirlot 2013 2015 a b have proved that the properties of the p relation used by the pseudo disjunctive electre tri are significantly different from the ones of the outranking relation s in the electre methods and more complex to analyze bouyssou and marchant 2015 nevertheless these conclusions are not necessarily valid in the general context of condition 1 where s may be a relation different from the outranking relation in electre methods in our view the p based primal and dual procedures equivalent through the transposition operation could be an alternative to the s based conjoint procedure to make it clearer our point let us consider only the case of two ordered classes c 1 and c 2 and suppose that b is the single limiting action xsb justifies assigning x to c 2 for the s based primal procedure but having xsb and not bsx xpb reinforces the arguments in favour of assigning x to c 2 under this view a p based assignment procedure can bring more information than the s based what may imply more justified assignments 3 1 the method let us assume the same basic requirements imposed on the set of limiting profiles in condition 2 in addition we require the separability requirements stated by condition 4 condition 4 separability conditions i there is no pair w z buk blk fulfilling wsz ii there is no pair w z bk bh h k fulfilling wsz iii for each z buk there is y blk such that ysz iv for each z bk there is w bk 1 such that wdz v for each z bk there is w bk 1 such that zdw remark 3 conditions 4 ii 4 iv and 4 v are equivalent to the separability conditions in electre tri nb cf fern ndez et al 2017 from conditions 4 i and 4 iii it follows that each action z in buk fulfills ypz with some action y blk what is a preference based separability condition between actions within the same limiting boundary bk definition 6 p relation between actions and boundaries a xpbk there is w bk such that xpw and there is no z bk fulfilling zpx b bkpx there is w bk such that wpx and there is no z bk fulfilling xpz definition 7 p based primal assignment procedure set the relational system d p according to condition 1 set bk k 1 m 1 fulfilling condition 2 and take bm as the ideal action set bmpx for all x for k 1 m find the first limiting boundary bk fulfilling bkpx take ck as an acceptable category to assign x definition 8 p based dual assignment procedure set the relational system d p according to condition 1 set bk k 1 m 1 fulfilling condition 2 and take b 0 as the anti ideal action set xpb 0 for all x for k m 1 0 find the first bk fulfilling xpbk take ck 1 as an acceptable category to assign x remark 4 both rules can work if buk respectively blk is empty for some k even for all k from 1 to m 1 the importance of having non empty buk and blk is related to the conformity property see proposition 8 and its proof if buk is empty for all k the primal assignment rule is basically identical to the electre tri nb and interclass nb pseudo disjunctive procedure proposition 6 basic properties of the p relation between actions and limiting boundaries under the d based separability requirements condition 4 iv and 4 v we have i xpbk xpbh for k h ii bkpx bhpx for h k see the proof in appendix a 3 2 structural properties of the p based primal and dual procedures as in subsection 2 3 we should prove the fulfillment of the consistency properties suggested by roy and bouyssou 1993 proposition 7 properties under basic requirements under the basic requirements from condition 2 the p based primal and dual procedures fulfill the following properties uniqueness each action is assigned to a unique class independence the assignment of an action does not depend on the assignment of the other actions homogeneity actions which compare the same way with respect to the limiting boundaries are assigned to the same class monotonicity ydx and x is assigned to ck y is assigned to ck with k k see the proof in appendix a proposition 8 conformity under conditions 2 and 4 the p based primal and dual procedures fulfill if x belongs to blk x is classified into ck 1 if x belongs to buk x is assigned to ck proof primal rule suppose that x blk from conditions 2 i and 4 i there is no w in bk such that wpx hence not bk px is fulfilled from conditions 4 ii and 4 iv there is z in bk 1 fulfilling zpx and there is no w bk 1 such that wpx hence bk 1 px definition 7 this implies that x is assigned to ck 1 by the primal procedure suppose now that x buk from condition 4 i there is no w in bk 1 fulfilling wpx it follows that not bk 1 px from condition 4 iii there is w in bk l such that wpx additionally from conditions 2 iv and 4 i there is no z in bk such that xpz hence bk px and x is classified into ck by the primal rule the proof for the dual rule is omitted it can be justified by the equivalence through the transposition operation remark 5 if blk is empty condition 4 iii cannot be applied and the property is not fulfilled by x buk similarly for the dual assignment rule if buk is empty the lack of condition 4 iii impedes to prove that x blk xpbk so x is not necessarily assigned to ck 1 proposition 9 stability under condition 2 and the d based separability requirements conditions 4 iv and 4 v the p based primal and dual procedures are stable under merging and splitting operations the proof follows a similar logic as in proposition 5 replacing definitions 2 and 3 and proposition 2 i and 2 ii by definitions 7 and 8 and propositions 6 i and 6 ii 4 two illustrative examples let us start with a toy example consider a set of actions a 0 3 5 preference increasing with criterion values and three ordered classes suppose that the pair dm decision analyst elicits the parameters of an electre tri model as follows below equal criterion weights wi 0 2 i 1 5 indifference thresholds qi 0 i 1 5 preference thresholds pi 0 5 i 1 5 veto thresholds vi 1 5 i 1 5 pre veto thresholds as in mousseau and dias 2004 ui 1 i 1 5 the dm should set two limiting boundaries b 1 and b 2 the actions in b 1 and b 2 are denoted buk j b lk j k 1 2 the performances of the limiting actions are shown in table 1 table 1 performances of limiting actions g 1 g 2 g 3 g 4 g 5 1 1 1 1 0 5 bu 1 1 bl 1 1 1 1 2 5 0 5 0 5 bu 2 1 1 1 2 2 1 bl 2 1 2 5 1 2 5 1 5 0 5 b l 2 2 1 2 5 2 5 1 5 0 5 let us take the dominance relation as d set 0 6 as credibility threshold to establish the crisp outranking relation s d and p relations between limiting actions are given in table 2 table 2 binary relations between limiting actions bl 2 1 bl 2 2 bu 2 1 bl 1 1 bu 1 1 bl 2 1 s

that the limiting actions in table 1 fulfill condition 3 and condition 4 hence both the s based and the p based conjoint procedure can be applied also fulfilling the structural properties given by propositions 3 5 and 7 9 let x 2 1 2 1 2 be an action to be assigned with the limiting profiles x fulfills the relations shown in table 3 table 3 binary relations between the action and limiting profiles bu 1 1 bl 1 1 bu 2 1 bl 2 1 bl 2 2 x p p s s 1 inc inc the relations between the action and the limiting boundaries definitions 1 and 6 are provided by table 4 table 4 relations between the action and the limiting boundaries b 0 b 1 b 2 b 3 x s s s 1 s 1 x p p incp p 1 note xr 1 b brx xincpb not xpb and not bpx according to definitions 2 and 3 x is assigned to c 2 by both the s based primal and dual rules this is consistent with the fact that x is indifferent to bu 2 1 which belongs to the upper layer of c 2 from definition 7 x is assigned to c 3 by the p based primal rule and to c 2 by p based dual rule definition 8 thus the p based conjoint procedure suggests c 2 and c 3 as possible assignments for x with the information provided by p the method is unable to suggest a well defined assignment from its indifference with bu 2 1 it follows that x is preferentially close to the limiting boundary b 2 since also not b 2 px the hesitation between c 2 and c 3 is justified let us address below a realistic size example the integrated impact of a set of research and development projects is determined by four points of view g 1 social impact g 2 improvement of the research team

7 outstanding let us take the pareto dominance as d with the above electre model s parameters the limiting actions in table 5 satisfy conditions 2 and 3 condition 2 is obviously fulfilled the d based separability conditions can be easily checked in table 5 we will focus on condition 3 i to check this we provide below the values of buk 1 blk 1 k 1 7 bu 1 1 bl 1 1 0 809 bu 2 1 bl 2 1 0 761 bu 3 1 bl

based primal rule in a descending procedure from k 7 we should identify the first k for which xsblk 1 we have x blk 1 0 for k 7 6 5 x bl 4 1 0 76 x bl 3 1 1 it is obvious that x bu 3 1 1 not bu 3 1 px hence we have both xsb 3 and not xsb 4 definition 1 from definition 2 x is assigned to c 4 average now applying the dual rule in an ascending procedure from k 1 we should find the first k such that buk 1 sx we have buk 1 x 0 k 1 2 bu 3 1 x 0 033 bu 4 1 x 0 863 additionally x bl 4 1 0 76 hence from definition 1 it follows that b 4 sx and not b 3 sx x is assigned to c 4 by the dual rule 5 discussion we can question whether the requirements of the methods are too restrictive condition 1 establishes requirements to the model of preferences whereas conditions 2 3 and 4 make requirements to the decision maker condition 2 establishes minimal requirements which are not different from those of electre tri nb except because we should use two layers to describe each limiting boundary requirements in condition 3 for the s based conjoint procedure may be questioned because its number although 3 ii 3 iii and 3 iv arise naturally from the order of classes requirements in condition 4 are similar to the hyper separability condition in electre tri nb see fern ndez et al 2017 except for the preference based separability requirement underlined by remark 3 which demands a high discrimination power from the decision maker as the numbers of classes and limiting actions increase a direct elicitation of these actions with the fulfillment of all the requirements becomes more difficult monotonicity homogeneity independence and uniqueness perhaps the most important structural properties are fulfilled under very basic conditions other requirements could be weakened without some of the requirements established by conditions 1 3 respectively condition 4 the s based resp p based primal dual conjoint procedure still works but fails to satisfy certain structural properties let us analyze some issues if s is not reflexive conformity is not fulfilled by the s based procedure this is the case when using the interval outranking approach the criterion performances of the limiting actions are non degenerate interval numbers conditions 3 i 3 iv respectively 4 i 4 iii are introduced to guarantee conformity in the s based resp p based procedure if any of these requirements is not fulfilled conformity is not guaranteed for the entire set of limiting actions nevertheless the assignment method still works for many other actions of the universe for instance if there is a pair w z buk blk fulfilling wsz in contradiction with condition 3 i conformity is not fulfilled for action w but is kept for the other limiting actions from a practical point of view this non fulfillment is important only if some actions to be assigned are similar to w without the d based separability conditions stability is not fulfilled by the s based procedure from a practical point of view the non fulfillment of this property is only important if the dm hesitates about the most appropriate definition of the set of classes once this set has been convincingly defined stability becomes a theoretical curiosity however the d based separability conditions are required to prove propositions 2 and 6 without proposition 2 using the s based primal rule we could have xsbk and not xsbh for some h k this questions assigning x to a class not worse than ck as suggested by the rule something similar happens to the s based dual rule and the p based conjoint procedure without the d based separability conditions stability and conformity are not satisfied by the p based procedure the p based procedure still works when some upper or lower limiting boundaries one of them for each boundary is empty although conformity fails to be fulfilled the s based procedure requires both non empty subsets buk and blk for each relational system of preferences fulfilling condition 1 if the decision maker is willing to fulfill conditions 2 and 3 respectively 2 and 4 the pair dm decision analyst can use definitions 1 3 resp 6 8 to build an outranking based resp p based primal dual conjoint procedure compatible with propositions 3 5 resp 7 9 this remark confers a wide generality to our proposal beyond electre type methods even beyond multi criteria decision methods we will distinguish some important particular cases 1 classical electre framework this case arises when s is the a crisp outranking relation obtained from the credibility index of the outranking x y used by the later electre methods roy 1991 let denote a real number within 0 5 1 considered as a credibility threshold to establish the crisp preference relations xsy x y p is defined by condition 13 and d is the classical pareto dominance relation it is well known that such a relational system fulfills condition 1 hence under condition 2 the s based respectively the p based conjoint primal dual procedure given by definitions 2 3 resp 7 8 can work and under condition 3 resp 4 all the structural properties of section 2 resp 3 given by propositions 3 5 resp 7 9 are fulfilled if in condition 2 we set buk as empty for k 1 m 1 it is easy to prove that the s based resp p based primal procedure is equivalent to the pseudo conjunctive resp pseudo disjunctive method of electre tri nb and electre tri b if card bk 1 for k 1 m 1 2 non compensatory sorting models this case is similar to the above under the axiomatic bases studied by bouyssou and marchant 2007 a majority sorting rule can be used to assign actions to ordered classes instead of the credibility index of the outranking a majority index value allows to establish a crisp outranking relation s e g meyer and olteanu 2019 combined with pareto dominance s fulfills condition 1 3 electre framework with interacting criteria electre methods originally required a family of criteria to be defined where no interaction between any pair of criteria exists this could be a real limitation since the interaction between criteria naturally arises in many situations contemplating these situations figueira et al 2009 presented a rather straightforward way to adapt the concordance index a crucial 3 in all the cases p is defined from s and condition 1 component of electre methods in such a way that a significant interaction between any pair of criteria can be considered if it exists and ignored if it does not exist in the approach by figueira et al 2009 the concordance index increases when there are pairs of criteria with strengthening interaction in the concordance coalition and decreases when there are pairs of criteria with weakening interaction in the same coalition it also decreases when there is antagonism between criteria in concordance coalition and criteria in discordance coalition let x y denote a pair of actions belonging to let g denote the set of criteria gi x denotes the evaluation of action x on criterion gi we suppose preference increasing with criterion values figueira et al 2009 proved that the extended concordance index c x y is a non decreasing function of gi x gi y for all criterion gi as in other electre methods the credibility index of the outranking is calculated as i x y c x y 1 d x y where d x y is the discordance index d x y is obtained from a certain aggregation of the marginal discordance indexes this aggregation should fulfill that for all gi d x y is non increasing with respect to gi x gi y crisp outranking relation is defined as xsy i x y let us take d as the pareto dominance the pair d s fulfills condition 1 as proved below i xdy xsy xdy gi x gi y gi g c x y 1 and d x y 0 i x y 1 xsy ii xsy and ydz xsz ydz gi y gi z gi g gi y gi z gi g gi x gi y gi x gi z gi g since c x y is non decreasing with respect to gi x gi y then c x z c x y a since gi x gi y gi x gi z gi g and d x y is non increasing with respect to gi x gi y then d x z d x y b from a b and the definition of i x y we have that i x y i x z xsz iii xdy and ysz xsz xdy gi x gi y gi g gi x gi z gi y gi z gi g since c x y is non decreasing with respect to gi x gi y we have c x z c y z c since gi x gi z gi y gi z gi g and d x y is non increasing with respect to gi x gi y then d x z d y z d from c d and the definition of i x y it follows that i y z i x z xsz this conclusion allows to handle interacting criteria in both electre tri b and electre tri nb without losing their structural properties 4 hierarchical electre in handling hierarchical structures under the electre paradigm a crisp outranking relation sh can be set on non elementary criteria gh as in corrente et al 2013 2016 2017 combining this relation with a preference relation xphy xshy and not yshx and the pareto dominance on subsets of elementary criteria which are descending from gh under the same arguments given above we can have a relational system of preferences which fulfils condition 1 thus defining appropriately the limiting boundaries between classes according to condition 2 the s based resp p based primal dual assignment procedure can work on the highest hierarchical level or on a chosen non elementary sub criterion under condition 3 resp 4 the assignment procedure fulfills the consistency properties from propositions 3 5 resp 7 9 the hierarchical pseudo conjunctive and pseudo disjunctive electre tri b with interacting criteria proposed by corrente et al 2016 are respectively particular cases of the s based and p based primal procedures when buk is empty and card blk 1 for k 1 m 1 5 interval outranking approach this is an extension of the outranking approach to the interval framework proposed by fern ndez et al 2019 2020 imprecisions on weights and veto thresholds are handled by using interval numbers imprecision and uncertainty on criterion performance levels can be handled by interval numbers in some criteria and discriminating thresholds for other criteria for a given majority threshold expressed by an interval number the method obtains a degree of credibility of the interval outranking let l x y denote the credibility index of the interval outranking with a majority threshold a crisp outranking relation can be defined as xsy l x y let us denote by g 1 the set of criteria whose levels are represented by pseudo criteria g 2 denotes the set of criteria whose scores are represented by non degenerate interval numbers assume preference increasing with criterion values the interval dominance is defined as follows definition 9 interval dominance let x y a a where x y and g 2 is not empty y is dominated by x iff the following is true i gj x gj y for all gj g 1 ii min poss gj x gj y for all gj g 2 0 5 where the italic bold letter denotes interval numbers and poss is a possibility function given by 1 b b b and c c c are interval numbers and pbc b c b b c c in fern ndez et al 2019 2020 the above possibility function is interpreted as a degree of credibility of b c if g 2 is empty under condition i above it is said that y is 1 dominated by x the 1 dominance is identical to the classical notion of pareto dominance fern ndez et al 2019 proved that the interval dominance and the interval outranking satisfy the requirements of condition 1 i 1 iii although s is not reflexive on interval numbers if x is described by pseudo criteria or by degenerate interval numbers xsx is fulfilled what permits to satisfy the conformity property of the s based method when the criterion performances of the limiting actions in conditions 2 i and 2 ii are real numbers interclass nb a generalization of electre tri nb using the interval outranking was proposed in fern ndez et al 2020 again if in condition 2 we set buk as empty for k 1 m 1 it is easy to prove that the s based respectively p based primal procedure is equivalent to the pseudo conjunctive respectively pseudo disjunctive rule of interclass nb 6 hierarchical interval outranking with interacting criteria the interval outranking proposed by fern ndez et al 2019 may be extended to handle interacting criteria and hierarchical structures suppose that sh is a crisp outranking relation 7 in a promethee framework let x y denote the binary preference degree calculated by promethee a reflexive outranking relation can be defined as xsy x y y x 0 if d is the pareto dominance relation it is easy to prove that the relational system d s satisfies condition 1 8 imprecise value functions suppose that the decision maker s preferences are modeled by an interval valued function u its simplest case is an interval weighted sum function in which criterion weights and criterion scores are interval numbers a reflexive outranking relation can be defined as xsy poss u x u y 0 5 where poss is the possibility function from equation 1 s is reflexive a stronger d relation can be defined as xdy poss u x u y 0 5 fulfilling condition 1 9 partial compensatory multiple criteria decision models let us consider a multiple criteria decision model in which an ordinal value function u is complemented by veto conditions in some or all criteria that is for all pair of actions x y u x u y and no veto condition is fulfilled x is at least as good as y xsy s is reflexive again taking d as the pareto dominance relation the pair d s fulfills condition 1 10 in a group decision framework if the property is a certain measure of consensus with an appropriate definition of d s the s based resp p based primal dual conjoint procedure could be used to assign potential collective decisions to classes of acceptable agreement 6 conclusions this paper has presented a general approach to designing ordinal classification methods based on comparing actions with limiting boundaries of ordered classes each boundary is described by two subsets of limiting actions making each class closed below and above this avoids the contradiction observed by other authors between the equivalence through the transposition operation and the assignment of limiting actions to the classes to which they belong closing the discussion about what property should predominate the methods require a relational system d s where s is a reflexive relation compatible with the order of classes and d is a transitive relation stronger than s from s an asymmetric preference relation p is defined on this background we propose s based and p based assignment methods each is composed of two complementary assignment procedures which correspond through the transposition operation and should be used conjointly the methods work under several basic conditions on the set of limiting boundaries under other more demanding separability requirements each procedure fulfills the structural properties of conformity stability monotonicity homogeneity independence and uniqueness nevertheless the methods still work without some of the demanding conditions although losing some properties the pseudo conjunctive respectively pseudo disjunctive assignment methods of electre tri b electre tri nb interclass nb and the hierarchical electre tri b with interacting criteria are particular cases of the s based resp p based descending resp ascending assignment rule proposed here using this general approach s and p based ordinal classification procedures with desirable properties arise from each decision method with capacity to build preference relations as in condition 1 this gives a theoretical support to the introduction of many diverse methods based on limiting boundaries between adjacent classes this point was illustrated by many different kinds of decision models section 5 as an avenue of future research some of them could be subject of study in forthcoming papers the s and p based procedures are alternative the p based method uses more information to suggest assignments requires a smaller number of separability conditions and can work with classes opened below or above although losing the conformity property however it requires a strong preference separability condition between actions in the same boundary belonging to adjacent classes the selection of the most appropriate method may be depending on i the way in which s is defined ii the nature of criterion scales and cardinality of the decision set iii the method direct or indirect used to elicit the model s parameters including the limiting actions and iv the specific characteristics of the decision maker finding guidelines to determine the most appropriate method is a second avenue for future research an illustrative and simple example showed that a direct setting of a few limiting actions fulfilling all the requirements could not be a demanding cognitive task for the decision maker a real size example with eight classes although addressed satisfactorily required much more effort as the number of classes increases setting many limiting actions fulfilling all the conditions would require indirect elicitation

2 i xsbk there is w blk such that xsw and there is no z bk fulfilling zpx from condition 3 vii there is y blh k h such that wdy and hence xsy condition 1 i for each z blh there is z blk such that zdz condition 3 viii there could not be z blh such that z px because z px and zdz zpx propostion 1 ii in contradiction with xsbk it follows that xsbh definition 1 a proposition 2 i bksx there is w buk such that wsx and there is no z bk fulfilling xpz from condition 3 v there is y buh h k such that ydw and ysx condition 1 i for each z buh there is z buk such that z dz condition 3 vi there could not be z buh such that xpz because xpz and z dz xpz proposition 1 i in contradiction with bksx it follows that bhsx definition 1 b proposition 3 proof the proofs of uniqueness independence and homogeneity are trivial determined by the form the assignment rules were designed see definitions 2 and 3 monotonicity property primal procedure let ck be the category to which x is assigned to x is assigned to ck there is w blk 1 such that xsw and there is no z bk 1 fulfilling zpx definition 1 a and definition 2 we have ydx and xsw w blk 1 ysw from condition 1 iii a there is no z bk 1 fulfilling zpy since zpy and ydx zpx proposition 1 i in contradiction with xsbk 1 b combining a b and definition 1 a we have ysbk 1 hence according to definition 2 y should be assigned to ck k k dual procedure let ck be the category to which x belongs to x is assigned to ck there is w buk such that wsx and there is no z bk fulfilling xpz definition 1 b and definition 3 suppose that y is assigned to ck k k from definition 1 b and definition 3 y is assigned to ck there is w buk such that wsy and there is no z bk fulfilling ypz additionally we have wsy and ydx wsx for some w buk c there is no z bk fulfilling ypz there is no z bk fulfilling xpz d since xpz and ydx ypz proposition 1 ii combining c and d we have bk sx definition 1 b according to definition 3 x should belong to class ck k k this contradicts the hypothesis proposition 4 proof primal procedure suppose that x blk since xsx from conditions 2 iii 3 i and definition 1 a we have xsbk with k k furthermore not xsbk for k k condition 3 ii from the primal procedure x is assigned to ck 1 suppose now that x buk from condition 3 i x does not fulfill xsbk definition 1 a but from condition 3 iii there is y blk 1 such that xsy combined with condition 3 ii we have xsbk 1 hence x is assigned to ck dual procedure suppose that x buk we have bk sx conditions 2 iv 3 i and definition 1 b also not bksx for k k from condition 3 ii then x is assigned to ck suppose that x blk we have not bk sx from condition 3 i definition 1 b and not bksx for k k condition 3 ii there is y in buk 1 such that ysx condition 3 iv then bk 1 sx from condition 3 ii and definition 1 b hence x is assigned to c k 1 proposition 5 proof primal procedure a merging operation between two consecutive categories i consider that the action x belongs to ch for h k 1 i e h 1 k before we proceed to a merging operation given the two propositions not xsbh and xsbh 1 are verified after removing bk we obtain exactly the same situation x will belong to the same category as before once b h 1 bh and c h 1 ch for h k ii consider that the action x belongs either to category ck or to category ck 1 before we proceed to a merging operation if before withdrawing bk x was in category ck 1 it naturally follows that xsbk and not xsbh for all h k from definition 2 and xsbk 1 from proposition 2 i after we proceed to a merging operation x will belong to category c k which is the category that combines the two categories ck and ck 1 if before we proceed to a merging operation the action x was in category ck from definition 2 we have both xsbk 1 and not xsbh for all h k 1 after a merging operation no one of the previous conditions changes from definition 2 the action x is added to category c k which is the category that combines both categories ck and ck 1 iii consider that action x belongs to category ch for h k before we proceed to a merging operation evidently after removing bk no one of the previous conditions changes according to definition 2 the action x is classified into the same category as previously b splitting a class in two new consecutive ones i consider that the action x belongs to ch for h k 1 before we proceed to a splitting operation according to definition 2 and definition 4 b it naturally follows both conditions not xsb h 1 and xsb h where b h bh 1 and b h 1 b h thus x will be assigned to category c h 1 the old ch ii consider that the action x belongs to category ck before we proceed to a splitting operation from definition 2 we obtain both conditions not xsbk and xsbk 1 after inserting the set b k according to definition 4 b we obtain both conditions not xsb k 1 and xsb k 1 from definition 2 and xsb k it follows that x will be classified into category c k 1 if x does not outrank b k x will be added to category c k thus x is will be added to one of the categories in which category ck was divided iii consider now that the action x belongs to category ch for all h k before we proceed to a splitting operation according to proposition 2 i not xsbh implies not xsb k after splitting the category no one of the previous conditions change given that b h bh for all h k from definition 4 b then after we proceed to a splitting operation the action x will be added to the category c h which is the same category ch for all h k dual procedure the proof follows the same logic as above but now using proposition 2 ii and definition 3 instead of proposition 2 i and definition 2 the proof is complete proposition 6 proof proposition 6 i xpbk there is w bk such that xpw and there is no z bk fulfilling zpx for each z bh there is z bk fulfilling zdz condition 4 iv there could not be z bh such that z px because z px and zdz zpx proposition 1 ii in contradiction with xpbk it follows that xpbh definition 6 a proposition 6 ii bkpx there is w bk such that wpx and there is no z bk fulfilling xpz for each z bh there is z bk such that z dz condition 4 v there could not be z bh such that xpz because xpz and z dz xpz proposition 1 i in contradiction with bkpx it follows that bhpx definition 6 b proposition 7 proof the proofs of uniqueness independence and homogeneity are obvious see proposition 3 monotonicity property dual procedure let ck be the category to which x is assigned to x is assigned to ck there is w bk 1 such that xpw and there is no z bk 1 fulfilling zpx definition 6 a and definition 8 ydx and xpw w blk 1 ypw from proposition 1 ii a there is no z bk 1 fulfilling zpy since zpy and ydx zpx proposition 1 i in contradiction with xpbk 1 b combining a b and definition 7 a we have ypbk 1 hence according to definition 8 y should belong to ck k k the proof for the primal rule is omitted it can be argued by the equivalence through the transposition operation
