universidad aut noma de sinaloa jnavarro uas edu mx corresponding author efra n solares universidad aut noma de coahuila efrain solaresl gmail com preprint submitted to european journal of operational research june 2 2021 abstract from a theoretical view this paper addresses the general problem of designing ordinal classification methods based on comparing actions with subset of actions which are representative of their classes categories the basic demand of the proposal consists in setting a relational system d s where s is a reflexive relation compatible with the preferential order of the set of classes and d is a transitive relation such that d is a subset of s different ordinal classification methods can be derived from diverse model of preferences fulfilling the basic conditions on s and d two complementary assignment procedures compose each method which correspond through the transposition operation and should be used complementarily the methods work under relatively slight conditions on the representative actions and satisfy several fundamental properties electre tri nc interclass nc and the hierarchical electre tri nc with interacting criteria can be considered as particular cases of this general framework keywords multi criteria decision ordinal classification outranking relations 1 introduction classification is one of the most common processes of human mind it is related to the process of assigning objects or alternatives actions to certain pre existing classes we are interested here in ordinal classification problems unlike nominal classification in ordinal classification the decision maker dm assigns objects to elements of a set of ordered classes also called categories in the related literature when the objects or actions are described by several or many evaluation criteria the dm faces the so called multi criteria ordinal classification problem muti criteria decision aid mcda researchers have developed a plethora of multi criteria ordinal classification methods basically these differ from two aspects a the underlying preference model and b the way in which classes are characterized from the point of view of the underlying decision model most of the methods obey to one of three main paradigms the functional paradigm based on the construction of value functions e g jacquet lagr ze 1995 zopounidis and doumpos 2000 k

there are two main approaches i using limiting actions that describe boundaries between adjacent classes e g roy and bouyssou 1993 perny 1998 araz and ozkarahan 2007 nemery and lamboray 2008 ishizaka et al 2012 bouyssou and marchant 2015 fern ndez et al 2017 bouyssou et al 2020 fern ndez et al 2020 ii through decision examples or reference actions whose classification is or may be known e g

i the most outstanding one is electre tri yu 1992 later renamed electre tri b almeida dias et al 2010 electre tri b defines the boundary between two contiguous classes using a single action this method was generalized in fern ndez et al 2017 to create electre tri nb where several actions can be used to characterize the boundary between each pair of contiguous classes the idea is that multiple actions provide more informed decisions both electre tri b and electre tri nb are based on two different assignment procedures so called pseudo conjunctive and pseudo disjunctive procedures very important structural properties unicity homogeneity independence conformity monotonicity and stability see roy and bouyssou 1993 are fulfilled by these procedures with slight modifications these properties were adapted and reformulated by almeida dias et al 2010 in the context of electre tri c the non fulfillment of some of these properties could be a serious drawback of other multi criteria ordinal classification approaches even when the methods based on limiting actions have been widely accepted they have also received critics regarding the difficulty of defining this type of actions this is particularly the case when the dm does not have a precise notion about the boundary between adjacent classes some authors have shown serious doubts about the existence of these boundaries in real world situations e g almeida dias et al 2010 k ksalan et al 2009 additionally electre tri b and its variants have been criticized from a deep theoretical point of view roy 2002 bouyssou and marchant 2015 and bouyssou et al 2020 showed that the pseudo conjunctive and pseudo disjunctive procedures do not correspond via the transposition operation this operation refers to inverting the ordering of the classes and the preference directions of the criteria such that the conclusions obtained after the inversions should not differ from the conclusions obtained before them bouyssou and marchant 2015 the value of the information obtained from the statement x outranks a limiting action b must be equal to that provided by the statement a limiting action b outranks x thus both statements should be considered when assigning x to a class so if a multi criteria ordinal classification procedure has an image method through the transposition operation both methods should be used conjointly bouyssou and marchant 2015 and bouyssou et al 2020 have proposed variants of electre tri b and electre tri nb which are symmetric with respect to the transposition operation however the fictitious character of the limiting actions in these proposals may be an additional limitation this paper is focused on methods based on representative actions an important advantage of these methods with respect to the ones based on limiting actions is that the dm may feel more comfortable setting representative actions than limiting profiles some of the former methods use a single central or representative action to characterize each class e g nemery and lamboray 2008 almeida dias et al 2010 ishizaka and nemery 2014 other methods use information about a few characteristics or representative actions e g k ksalan et al 2009 almeida dias et al 2012 several approaches can handle many reference actions which are not necessarily representative of their class e g jacquet lagr ze 1995 doumpos and zopounidis 2004 fernandez and navarro 2011 in particular we are interested in methods that use a single or a few characteristic actions to describe the related classes within this kind of approaches electre tri nc almeida dias et al 2012 deserves special recognition electre tri nc is composed by two rules ascending and descending procedures that correspond via the transposition operation and are used conjointly in this method the information coming from x outranks a representative action r has the same value as the obtained from a representative action r outranks x and the overall information is used for assigning x both the ascending and descending rules fulfil a set of structural properties which are similar to those fulfilled by electre tri b and electre tri nb electre tri nc has evolved in two fundamental directions a hierarchical electre tri nc with interacting criteria was proposed by corrente et al 2016 ordinal classification problems can be solved in different levels of the hierarchy the fulfilment of the structural properties maybe altered by interaction of criteria was not addressed by this paper recently electre tri nc was extended to the interval framework by fern ndez et al 2020 the interclass nc method exhibits symmetry with respect to the transposition operation and satisfies the same structural properties as the former method this is interesting since the outranking credibility index is calculated by interclass nc in a quite different form 1 so we question whether the fulfilment of these properties depends on more general features in this paper our aim is to study some axiomatic bases related to ordinal classification methods with similar features as electre tri nc i describing classes through their representative actions and ii exploiting an at least as good relation between actions to be assigned and representative actions suppose any relation x is at least as good as y with respect to a certain desirable property there is no matter the way to create this relation suppose that the pair dm decision analyst wants to use such a relation to design a caracteristic actions based assignment method to classes ordered in the sense of increasing in this paper we address the following fundamental issue to propose a general form of the decision rule and identifying the requirements on the set of characteristic actions in order to fulfill i the entire set of structural properties which should be similar to the ones suggested by almeida dias et al 2010 and ii symmetry with respect to the transposition operation this general characterization is inspired by electre tri nc but it is more general the novelty of this paper is also supported by to be an extension of electre tri nc and its desirable properties to any preference model under very general demands to present a method to design new ordinal classification approaches with similar characteristics as electre tri nc but based on diverse preference models 2 on this base the pair dm decision analyst can choose the most appropriate preference model then assessing the representative actions and using an ordinal classification method with the desirable features analyzed in this paper this opens a very wide space for combining preference models and characteristic or representative actions in new ordinal classification methods the paper structure is the following after this introduction the method and its requirements are presented in section 2 the fulfillment of the basic properties is proved in section 3 section 4 outlines different models of preference which are 1 in a hierarchical interval outranking approach with interacting criteria under review in european journal of operational research a hierarchical interclass nc also satisfies the same set of structural properties 2 in a theoretical look at ordinal classification methods based on comparing actions with limiting boundaries between adjacent classes under review in annals of operations research similar goals were reached concerning electre tri b and ordinal classification methods based on boundary actions compatible with the general method proposed here and could bring new ordinal classification approaches with two examples the application of the method is illustrated in section 5 lastly we give brief conclusions in section 6 2 a generalized ordinal classification method based on representative actions definition 1 compatibility with the order of classes consider a set of m ordered and predefined classes c c 1 ck cm m 2 ordered in the sense of increasing a certain desirable feature we say that a binary relation s is compatible with the order of c iff xsy gives an argument to believe that x should be classified into a class equal or higher than y condition 1 requirements on the relational system of preferences 3 let us consider a set of classes c according to definition 1 and a pair of binary relations d s with the following characteristics d is a transitive relation s is a reflexive relation compatible with the order of c x y z a a a i xdy xsy ii xsy and ydz xsz iii xdy and ysz xsz if s is transitive and reflexive it suffices to take d s to fulfill a set of desirable properties the following demands are needed condition 2 characterization of categories through a reference set r each element ck belonging to the set of categories c is characterized by a subset rk of representative actions rk j j 1 card rk fulfilling a for k 1 m 1 for all action w in rk there is at least one action z in rk 1 such that zdw b for k 1 m 1 for all action w in rk 1 there is at least one action z in rk such that wdz c for all k h h k k 1 m 1 for each action w in rh there is no action z in rk such that zsw the set r rk j j 1 card rk k 1 m is called the reference set it should be remarked that condition 2 is less demanding than the requirements in electre tri nc in which each pair w z rk 1 rk such fulfill wdz and other stronger separability conditions in order to satisfy the whole set of structural properties of the method definition 2 s relation between actions and subsets of representative actions a xsrk if and only if there is z rk such that xsz b rksx if and only if there is w rk such that wsx 3 under very general conditions at least as good as relations created by multi criteria decision methods and the pareto dominance relation fulfill this demand proposition 1 properties of the s relation between actions and subsets of representative actions suppose that the set r fulfills condition 2 for all x belonging to a i xsrk xsrh for all h k ii rksx rhsx for all h k the proof follows from conditions 1 2 a and 2 b and definitions 2 a and 2 b similarly to electre tri nc and the primal dual procedure in bouyssou and marchant 2015 and bouyssou et al 2020 we propose a method with two rules given by definitions 3 and 4 definition 3 descending assignment rule set s d and r fulfilling conditions 1 and 2 for all x set xsr 0 i for k m 0 determine the first rk such that xsrk ii if k m assign x to cm iii if k 0 assign x to c 1 iv for 0 k m select ck and ck 1 as possible categories to assign x remark 1 a if in definition 3 k takes a value within the interval 1 k m xsrk supports assigning x to a class not worse than ck not xsrk 1 is an argument against assigning x to a class higher than ck 1 combining these arguments ck and ck 1 are compatible assignment decisions b x may be assigned to ck xsrh for all h k definition 3 and proposition 1 i c xsrk k 1 x may be assigned to ch for some h k definition 3 and proposition 1 i d x may be assigned to ck not xsrh for all h k 1 definition 3 and proposition 1 i e not xsrk x may be assigned to ch for some h k definition 3 and proposition 1 i definition 4 ascending assignment rule set s d and r fulfilling conditions 1 and 2 for all x set rm 1 sx i for k 1 m 1 determine the first rk such that rksx ii if k 1 assign x to c 1 iii if k m 1 assign x to cm iv for 1 k m 1 select ck and ck 1 as possible categories to assign x in definition 4 reasons similar to remark 1 a but using instead rksx and not rk 1 sx justify selecting ck and ck 1 as possible assignments the above rules are inspired by the ones in electre tri nc cf almeida dias et al 2012 but with a significant difference let us explain this in detail consider for instance the descending assignment rule if 0 k m electre tri nc uses the higher value of the selection function to choose a single assignment between ck and ck 1 the selection function x rk is calculated by using the credibility indices of the outranking between x and the actions in rk combined with the min operator in the present proposal the binary relation s does not necessarily come from a credibility degree of a binary preference and we prefer to keep its generality the selection function in electre tri nc can be interpreted as a credibility degree of an indifference relation between x and rk x rk 1 x rk is a good reason to select ck 1 as assignment for x if the value x rk 1 reaches certain threshold but when x rk 1 is close to zero to choose the range ck ck 1 as possible assignment is a better option to illustrate this point consider an application of electre tri c with the following data number of criteria 4 increasing preference number of classes 3 c 3 is the most preferred weights 0 25 0 25 0 25 0 25 indifference thresholds 0 0 0 0 preference thresholds 1 1 1 1 credibility threshold 0 75 the single criterion with veto power is the fourth one v 4 3 the classes are characterized by the following sets r 1 4 4 4 4 r 2 7 7 7 7 r 3 10 10 10 10 let x be the action 1 4 4 7 we have x r 3 0 x r 2 0 25 x r 1 0 75 hence k 1 according to the descending rule additionally r 2 x 1 and r 1 x 0 then x r 1 min x r 1 r 1 x 0 and x r 2 min x r 2 r 2 x 0 25 x is assigned to c 2 by the descending rule of electre tri c it is not difficult to analyze that x is assigned also to c 2 by the electre tri c ascending procedure however x is outranked by respectively outranks r 1 in three criteria whereas the action is worse than r 2 in all the criteria except the fourth one hence a hesitation between c 1 and c 2 seems more appropriate as suggested by definition 3 note that the ascending and descending procedures in definitions 3 and 4 correspond via the transposition operation as discussed in introduction both rules should be used conjointly however since each rule suggests two possible classes the range between the less preferred and the most preferred class could be inappropriately wide therefore we explain below a way to reduce the range of classes when the ascending and descending rules are combined firstly we define some other binary relations between actions and subsets of representative actions definition 5 indifference preference and incomparability relations between actions and representative subsets indifference xirk xsrk and rksx preference xprk xsrk and not rksx rkpx rksx and not xsrk incomparability xincrk not xsrk and not rksx thus x is comparable with rk if and only if xsrk or rksx in this case we say that ck is well described with respect to action x in order to achieve comparability between x and rk it suffices to include in rk an action z such that zsx or xsz lemma 1 relationship between the assignments suggested by both rules suppose that x is comparable with all rk k 1 m x is assigned by the descending procedure to a possible class which is not lower than the highest possible class suggested by the ascending procedure proof suppose that x is assigned to c 1 by the descending rule then from definition 3 x does not outrank rh for h 1 m from the premise of comparability r 1 sx hence x is assigned to c 1 by the ascending rule definition 4 the case when x is assigned to cm is trivial suppose now that x is assigned to the range ck ck 1 by the descending rule from definition 3 xsrk and not xsrh for h k from the premise of comparability it follows that rhsx for h k if in the ascending procedure h k 1 was the first index for which rhsx x would be assigned to the range ck ck 1 definition 4 if h k 1 x would be assigned to ch 1 ch this completes the proof remark 2 xirh for k h k brings positive arguments to classify x into a class within the range ck ck the case where xprh is combined with xirh i and rh 2 px suggests the assignment to ch 1 as more appropriate on the other hand xincrh means lack of positive and negative arguments to suggest the assignment to ch xprh combined with xincrh i do not contradict assigning x to ch or ch 1 because the action could be from a preference point of view close to the boundary between both classes suppose that an action x is assigned to cm by the descending rule and to c 1 by the ascending one from definitions 3 and 4 we have xsrm and r 1 sx from propositions 1 i and 1 ii it follows that xsrh and rhsx for h 1 m xirh for h 1 m this justifies that x may be assigned to any class in the interval c 1 cm if x is assigned to cm by the ascending rule and to c 1 by the descending procedure the analysis is similar but replacing i by inc since x is incomparable with rk for k 1 m there is no argument to assign x to any particular class all the assignments are possible suppose that x is assigned to ck or ck 1 by the ascending procedure and to ck or ck 1 by the descending rule let us analyze different situations first case ck 1 ck coincidence of the assignments from definition 3 and proposition 1 i x assigned to ck or ck 1 by the descending rule xsrk not xsrh for h k and xsrh for h k a from definition 4 and proposition 1 ii x assigned to ck or ck 1 by the ascending rule rk sx not rhsx for h k and rhsx for h k b combining a b and definition 5 we have xprh for h k and rhpx for h k x may be assigned to ck or ck 1 being from a preference point of view close to the border between these classes second case k k k x is assigned to ck 1 or ck by the ascending rule and to ck or ck 1 by the descending one the ranges of assignment intersect on ck from definition 3 and proposition 1 i x assigned to ck or ck 1 by the descending rule xsrk not xsrh for h k and xsrh for h k c from definition 4 and proposition 1 ii x assigned to ck or ck 1 by the ascending rule rksx not rhsx for h k and rhsx for h k d combining c d and definition 5 it follows that xirk xprh h k and rhpx for h k according to remark 2 x should be classified into ck third case k k the ranges of assignments do not intersect combining a b and definition 5 we have xirh for k h k xprh for h k and rhpx for h k according to remark 2 this result justifies the assignment to any class within the range ck ck fourth case k 1 k 1 x is assigned to ck 1 or ck by the ascending rule and to ck or ck 1 by the descending one the ranges of assignments intersect on ck 1 ck 1 combining a b and definition 5 we obtain xincrk 1 xprh for h k 1 and rhpx for h k according to remark 2 any class within the range ck ck is a possible assignment for x fifth case k 1 k 1 the ranges of assignments do not intersect from a b and definition 5 it follows that xincrh for k h k rhpx for h k and xprh for h k again according to remark 2 any class within the range ck ck is a possible assignment for x for simplicity when an action is assigned to a single class ck we say that the action is classified into the range ck ck as a consequence of the analysis above we propose the following rule for the conjoint use of the ascending and descending procedures definition 6 conjoint assignment rule a if an action x is assigned to cm respectively c 1 by the descending respectively ascending rule take the range c 1 cm as possible assignments for x b if x is assigned to the range ch ch 1 by both ascending and descending rules take the same range of classes as possible assignments for x c suppose that x is assigned to the range ch ck respectively ck ch by the ascending resp descending procedure then if k k take the range ck ck as possible assignments for x otherwise k k take the range ck ck as possible assignments for x given an assignment range ck ch the classes ck and ch will be called the limits of the range note that the limits of the conjoint assignment range are the lower limit of the descending assignment range and the upper limit of the ascending assignment range 3 structural properties of the method unlike precedent works as almeida dias et al 2010 2012 and fern ndez et al 2020 in which the structural properties are analyzed for the ascending and descending rules separately here we also address the analysis of the properties regarding the conjoint assignment rule given by definition 6 propositions 2 3 and remark 3 describe the conformity property of the proposal proposition 2 the descending assignment rule fulfills the following properties i each w rm is assigned to cm ii each w rk k m is assigned to a class within the range ck ck 1 the proof is immediate from definition 3 and conditions 1 and 2 c proposition 3 the ascending assignment rule fulfills the following properties a each w r 1 is assigned to c 1 b each w rk k 1 is assigned to a class within the range ck 1 ck the proof is immediate from definition 4 and conditions 1 and 2 c remark 3 from propositions 2 and 3 and definition 6 it is obvious that each z belonging to rk k 1 m is assigned to ck by the conjoint assignment rule we conclude that conformity is not fulfilled by the separated rules but it is satisfied by the conjoint assignment procedure proposition 4 monotonicity of the ascending and descending rules i if y is assigned to a single ck by the descending respectively ascending procedure and xdy then x is assigned to a single ck k k or to a range ck ck 1 k k ii if y is assigned to a range ck ck 1 by the descending respectively ascending procedure and xdy then x is assigned to a single ck k k 1 or to a range ck ck 1 k k see the proof in appendix 1 definition 7 comparison of ranges of classes let range 1 ck ck and range 2 ch ch be two ranges of classes in c we say that range 1 is not worse than range 2 denoted range 1 range 2 iff k h and k h proposition 5 monotonicity of the conjoint assignment procedure if y is assigned to range 1 by the conjoint assignment procedure and xdy then x is assigned to a range range 2 range 1 see the proof in appendix 1 definition 8 merging and splitting operations a merging operation two adjacent categories ck and ck 1 will be merged to become a new one c k characterized by a new subset of reference actions r k rk rk 1 the new set of classes is c c 1 ck 1 c k ck 2 cm which updating the subscripts can be denoted as c 1 c k 1 c k c k 1 c m 1 the new set of reference actions is r r 1 rk 1 r k rk 2 rm which can be denoted as r r 1 r k 1 r k r k 1 r m 1 the fulfillment of condition 2 of the new reference set r is a direct consequence of the fulfillment of condition 2 on the previous before merging reference set r b splitting operation the category ck is split into two new adjacent classes c k and c k characterized by two new distinct subsets of reference actions r k and r k respectively the new set of classes is c c 1 ck 1 c k c k ck 1 cm which updating the subscripts will be denoted as c 1 c k 1 c k c k 1 c k 2 c m 1 the new set of reference actions is r r 1 rk 1 r k r k rk 1 rm which will be denoted as r r 1 r k 1 r k r k 1 r k 2 r m 1 r should fulfill condition 2 proposition 6 stability of the ascending and descending rules with respect to merging and splitting operations the ascending and descending rules fulfill the following statements 1 after a merging operation a an action that was classified into a range of classes which does not contain the merged categories is assigned to the same range b an action that was classified into a range of classes whose lower respectively upper category was merged is assigned to a range composed of the same upper respectively lower category and the new class c when the merging is carried out with both classes of the range to which an action was assigned this is classified into a range of classes which contains the new category 2 after a splitting operation a an action that was classified into a range of classes which does not contain the modified category keeps its assignment to the same range b an action that was classified into a range which contains the split class is either assigned to the range composed of the new classes or to a range composed of a new class and the other class in the range before splitting see the proof in appendix 1 proposition 7 analysis of the stability of the conjoint assignment rule with respect to merging and splitting operations 1 after a merging operation a an action that was classified into a range of classes which does not contain the merged categories keeps its assignment to the same range b an action that was classified into a range of adjacent classes whose lower and upper limits are merged is assigned to the new class c an action that was classified into a range of classes whose lower respectively upper limit was merged is assigned to a range composed of the same upper respectively lower limit and the new class d when the merging is carried out with two classes that are within the range neither in the lower nor in the upper of the range to which an action was assigned it is classified into the same range as before the merging 2 after a splitting operation a when the split class is adjacent to one of the limits of the assignment range of an action x the new assignment range is the same or the old limit is replaced by one of the new classes b when one of the limits of the assignment range is split the new limit is one of the new classes or one of their adjacent classes c when the split class is neither a limit of the assignment range nor one of their adjacent classes the assignment range keeps its limit classes see the proof in appendix 1 remark 4 there are some cases see 2 a and 2 b above where after the splitting the new range of classes can have different limits from the original limits of the conjoint assignment range it should be noticed that in such cases the union of r k and r k 1 may be different from the old rk it is not surprising that with different preference information the assignment of an action could be modified 4 examples of ordinal classification methods that can be built by using this proposal for each relational system d s satisfying definition 1 and condition 1 an ordinal classification method can be built by using definitions 3 and 4 such a method would be symmetric with respect to the transposition operation and it would fulfill the paradigmatic properties stated by roy and bouyssou 1993 and adapted by almeida dias et al 2010 for electre tri c this remark is valid whatever the decision model even beyond multi criteria decision models we will distinguish some important particular cases 1 classical electre framework this case arises when s is the a crisp outranking relation obtained from the credibility index of the outranking x y used by the later electre methods roy 1991 let denote a real number within 0 5 1 considered as a credibility threshold to establish the crisp outranking relations xsy x y d is the classical pareto dominance relation it is well known that such a relational system fulfills condition 1 setting the reference set fulfilling condition 2 the ascending and descending rules and the conjoint assignment method from definitions 3 4 and 6 can be used it would be a variant of electre tri nc which fulfills similar properties uses a more relaxed reference set and suggests perhaps more justified assignments as discussed in section 2 2 electre framework with interacting criteria figueira et al 2009 introduced a way to extend the electre family of methods to handle interactions among criteria with such extension these methods can now handle strengthening weakening and antagonism between criteria the concordance index c x y is used by the electre methods to model the strength of the arguments in favor of the statement action x is at least as good as action y c x y will now increase when there is a pair of criteria with strengthening interaction both supporting the statement it will decrease when there are pairs of criteria with weakening interaction if both criteria support the statement finally the concordance index will decrease when there is antagonism between criteria where one criterion supports the statement and the other opposes to it let a be the set of actions g the set of criteria and gi x denote the assessment of action x a on criterion gi g such that without loss of generality gi x increases with preference then the extended concordance index c x y is a non decreasing function of gi x gi y for all criterion gi figueira et al 2009 the discordance index d x y in the extended version of electre is calculated from an aggregation of the marginal discordance indices as traditionally d x y requires that for all gi d x y is non increasing with respect to gi x gi y through c x y and d x y a credibility index of the statement is calculated as x y c x y 1 d x y finally the outranking relation s is defined as xsy x y for a sufficiently great majority threshold if d is the pareto dominance then the pair d s fulfills condition 1 see appendix 2 this indicates that electre tri nc can handle interacting criteria preserving its structural properties 3 multi criteria ordinal classification based on a majority rule this kind of approaches build an outranking relation using a majority rule as in meyer and olteanu 2019 a concordance measure is built with criterion weights and criterion scores a crisp outranking relation s is defined by comparison with a certain threshold this relation satisfies definition 1 if d is the pareto dominance the relational system d s fulfills condition 1 with appropriate setting of representative actions according to condition 2 the method proposed in this paper can be used this method fulfills the properties from propositions 2 5 4 hierarchical electre electre methods that handle hierarchical structures can build an outranking relation sh on any non elementary criterion gh see e g corrente et al 2013 2016 2017 this relation is reflexive and compatible with a set of ordered classes as required by definition 1 taking d as the pareto dominance for sub criteria of gh then such a relational system of preferences fulfills condition 1 under the same claims given above thus if the characteristic actions are defined properly regarding condition 2 the method based on definitions 3 4 and 6 can work on the highest hierarchical level or on any non elementary sub criterion the method fulfills the consistency properties from propositions 2 5 and remark 3 the hierarchical electre tri c with interacting criteria proposed by corrente et al 2016 is similar to our method and hence it satisfies the same properties 5 interval outranking approach the so called interval outranking approach was first proposed by fern ndez et al 2019 and later improved in fern ndez et al 2020 this approach extends the outranking paradigm to handle imprecisions on weights and veto thresholds by using interval numbers imprecision and uncertainty related to criterion performances can also be handled by using interval numbers but since different types of imprecision and uncertainty can affect criterion performances the interval outranking approach can also deal with these situations by using discriminating thresholds which type of modeling tool should be used depends on the context of each criterion let x y denote the credibility index of the interval outranking relation with a majority threshold the outranking relation can be defined as xsy x y the outranking relation defined this way is compatible with a set of ordered classes definition 1 an interval based dominance was described in fern ndez et al 2019 it was proved in that work that the interval based outranking and dominance relations fulfil condition 1 even when the interval based outranking is not reflexive it will always fulfill xsx if action x is characterized by pseudo criteria or by real numbers thus satisfying the conformity property when the criterion performances of the characteristic actions in condition 2 are real numbers so the method based on definitions 3 4 and 6 can be implemented and it satisfies propositions 2 5 and remark 3 indeed the interclass nc by fern ndez et al 2020 is a variant of the method proposed here 6 hierarchical interval outranking with interacting criteria it is possible to extend the interval based outranking approach to deal with criteria that interact and that are structured as hierarchies 4 let sh be an outranking relation related to a non elementary criterion gh sh is compatible with a set of ordered classes with respect to gh definition 1 now let d be defined similarly to the interval dominance on the subset of elementary criteria descending from gh the pair d sh fulfills condition 1 defining appropriately the representative actions of classes according to condition 2 the method based on definitions 3 4 and 6 suggest assignments to classes related to gh 7 promethee tri nc promethee calculates a binary preference degree x y through which a reflexive binary relation compatible with a set of ordered classes can be defined as xsy x y y x 0 then using the pareto dominance d it is easy to demonstrate that the system d s satisfies condition 1 a conjoint assignment method based on definitions 3 4 and 6 can be used 8 interval based value functions the preferences of the dm can be modeled by an interval value function u the simplest function of this type is an interval weighted sum function in such function both criterion weights and criterion scores are interval numbers therefore a reflexive outranking relation can be defined as xsy poss u x u y 0 5 where poss is the possibility function from equation 1 1 if 1 if 0 1 0 if 0 1 4 a hierarchical interval outranking approach with interacting criteria under review in european journal of operational research and are interval numbers and in fern ndez et al 2019 2020 the above possibility function is interpreted as a degree of credibility of e d so the order relation on interval numbers is defined as e d poss e d 0 5 s is reflexive and compatible with a set of ordered classes let us define d as xdy poss u x u y 0 5 since the order relation on interval numbers is transitive cf fern ndez et al 2019 the relational system d s satisfies condition 1 9 compensatory preferences combined with veto conditions assume the existence of a model where an ordinal value function u is combined with the consideration of veto situations this means that for all x y xsy u x u y and no veto condition is fulfilled x is at least as good as y s is reflexive and compatible with a set of ordered classes definition 1 without loss of generality suppose that u is monotonically increasing with criterion scores again taking d as the pareto dominance relation the pair d s fulfills condition 1 10 decision models in group contexts if the property is a measure of agreement then properly defining d s the method based on definitions 3 4 and 6 could be used to assign potential collective decisions to classes of acceptable agreement 5 illustrative examples let us discuss two examples the first one is the toy case illustrated in section 2 the second example comes from a more realistic multi criteria problem 5 1 revisiting the toy example in section 2 this example corresponds to the classical electre framework the action x 1 4 4 7 should be assigned to one the three classes described by the single actions r 1 4 4 4 4 r 2 7 7 7 7 r 3 10 10 10 10 as we discussed in section 2 x is assigned to c 2 by electre tri c with the outranking parameters described in section 2 we had x r 3 0 x r 2 0 25 x r 1 0 75 r 3 x 1 r 2 x 1 r 1 x 0 the s relation is taken as xsy x y where is set as 0 75 note that the set of representative actions fulfils condition 2 the binary relations that follow from definition 5 are provided by table 1 table 1 relations between x and representative actions r 1 r 2 r 3 x p p 1 p 1 note xp 1 rk rkpx applying the descending rule definition 3 k 1 is the first k value for which xsrk hence x is assigned to the range c 1 c 2 by the rule applying the ascending rule k 2 is the first value fulfilling rksx action x is assigned to the same range c 1 c 2 by the ascending rule according to definition 6 b x is assigned to the range c 1 c 2 by the conjoint method we can argue that with the information in table 1 it is not possible to select a single class 5 2 assigning impact of r d projects the overall impact of a set of research and development projects is determined by four criteria economic impact social impact scientific impact and improvement of research competence each criterion is evaluated in a qualitative scale with levels very low low below average average above average high very high the dm does not want to accept projects with an overall impact lower than high s he is considering to assign projects to one class of the ordered set c unsatisfactory high very high outstanding the dm agrees on an electre model without veto conditions given the nature of the scale s he sets discriminating thresholds equal to zero under these conditions the model corresponds to a majority sorting rule the dm assesses the same importance to all the criteria so wi 0 25

outstanding very high or outstanding it should be remarked that the conjoint assignments are clearly justified by the relations p and i in table 4 6 some conclusions this paper has perhaps presented the widest generalization of the idea behind the electre tri nc multi criteria ordinal classification approach whatever the model used to represent the decision maker s preferences our proposal is a general approach to design ordinal classification methods based on comparing actions to be assigned with representative actions of their respective class the main requirement is a relational system d s where s is reflexive relation that is compatible with the preferential order of classes and d is a transitive relation that should be a subset of s additionally the proposal requires a reference set composed of representative actions of their classes unlike electre tri nc and related methods our approach does not require any valued closeness relation or selection function the proposed general approach is composed of two complementary assignment rules which correspond through the transposition operation and should be used conjointly these rules are similar to the ascending and descending procedures in electre tri nc but a bit more conservative instead of using a selection function as electre tri nc the rules in this paper suggest a range of adjacent classes the rules are combined in a less conservative conjoint assignment method which suggests a range of classes determined by the lower respectively upper limit of the descending resp ascending assignment range under slight conditions on the representative actions less demanding than in electre tri nc the rules and the conjoint assignment procedure fulfill the structural properties of conformity stability monotonicity homogeneity independence and uniqueness which are analyzed for each rule and for the conjoint assignment procedure electre tri nc its interval extension interclass nc and the hierarchical electre tri nc and interclass nc with interacting criteria can be considered as particular cases of the general approach proposed here using this a plethora of ordinal classification procedures with desirable properties may arise from each decision model with capacity to build relations s and d fulfilling the basic features mentioned before the pair dm decision analyst can choose the most appropriate preference model assessing the representative actions and using an ordinal classification method with the desirable features analyzed in this paper this opens a very wide space for combining preference models and characteristic or representative actions in new ordinal classification methods this point was illustrated by many different kinds of decision models section 4 as an avenue of

ysrk xsrh for a certain h k from condition 1 and definition 2 if h m x is assigned to cm if h m then x is assigned to the range ch ch 1 taking k h completes the proof ascending rule the proof comes from the equivalence through the transposition operation proposition 5 proof if y is assigned to the range c 1 cm the proof is immediate from definition 6 a definition 7 and proposition 4 if y is assigned to the range ch ch 1 by both ascending and descending rules the proof is immediate from definition 6 b definition 7 and proposition 4 consider now the case where y is assigned to the range ck

ch 1 ch by the ascending rule h k and to the range ch ch 1 by the descending rule h k if h h from definition 6 c it follows that x is assigned to ch ch since h k and h k we have ch ch ck ck if h h from definition 6 c x is assigned to ch ch since h k it is obvious that ch ch ck ck lastly let us analyze the case k k from definition 6 c y is assigned to the range ck ck if h h h k ch ch ck ck if h

xsrm and xsrm with definition 8 a xsr m 1 x is assigned to the range c m 1 c m 1 where c m 1 is the old cm suppose that x was assigned to the range ck 1 ck from definition 3 it follows that xsrk 1 and not xsrn for all n k not xsr k we have that x is assigned to the range c k 1 c k where c k 1 is the old ck 1 suppose that x was assigned to the range c 1 c 1 where k 1 in definition 8 a from definition 3 we have that xsr 0 and not xsrn for all n 0 not xsr n for all n 0 hence x is assigned to the range c 1 c 1 1 c suppose that x was assigned to the range ck ck 1 before the merging from

from proposition 1 i we have that xsrk 1 xsr k 1 there are the following three possible cases 1 xsr k and xsr k 1 definition 3 x is assigned to the range c k 1 c k 2 2 xsr k and not xsr k 1 definition
