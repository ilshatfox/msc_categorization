leuvenlaan 4 3584 ce utrecht the netherlands dated january 19 2021 a simple deterministic and time reversal invariant type of thermostat is proposed to be used for computer simulations of classical systems it acts on collisions with the walls of the container exclu sively it maps the incoming and outgoing velocity of an impinging particle onto each other uniquely in a way that satisfies a detailed balance condition with respect to the local wall temperature it is fast to implement on a computer leads to rapid equilibration or approach to a stationary nonequilibrium state and it effects the physical properties of the system in a narrow boundary layer only because of the deterministic nature it is especially suitable for studying dynamical systems characteristics such as lyapunov exponents and fractal dimensions of attractors a few successful applications have been reported already pacs numbers 05 10 a 05 45 pq 65 20 de in computer simulations of classical many particle sys tems the most common way of accounting for energy and momentum exchange with the walls of the system has been by modelling particle wall collisions stochastically see e g 1 usually in these models a particle collid ing with a wall is supposed to be absorbed and reemit ted instantaneously according to a maxwell distribution with the local temperature and velocity of the wall this makes the implementation in a simulation rather slow for each velocity component a random number has to be drawn and converted to a velocity value and in appli cations to dynamical systems where one likes to follow bundles of nearby trajectories in phase space it is not clear how to implement the random reflections in a con sistent way to a full bundle an alternative exists in the form of deterministic ther mostats modelling collisions of particles with a wall by mapping precollisional velocities in a unique way to post collisional ones see e g 2 for example chernov and lebowitz 3 studied couette flow by introducing deter ministic wall thermostats which assign to each incoming velocity v a unique outgoing velocity v depending on the orientation and local velocity of the wall at the po sition q of the collision this is done in one case in a time reversal invariant way so an incoming velocity v is mapped to v in addition v v so energy is con served and the mapping is such that the mean velocity of a particle at the wall is proportional to the local wall velocity in case the latter vanishes uniformly the micro canonical distribution if necessary constrained to zero momentum parallel to the walls and fixed value of the corresponding center of mass component is stationary under the equations of motion and initial nonequilibrium distributions should decay to equilibrium in the usual coarse grained sense under couette boundary condi tions rapid decay to a macroscopically stationary state has been observed accompanied by an ongoing phase h vanbeijeren uu nl space contraction toward a fractal distribution of lower dimensionality than that of phase space 3 4 for simulating thermal walls which exchange energy with the system in such a way that at least locally it tends to equilibrate at a temperature t q similar map pings may be devised the simplest of these probably is a mapping in which the normal velocity vn v n q with n q the unit vector normal to the wall pointing inward at the position q is mapped to v n and the ve locity components parallel to the wall remain unchanged this mapping is defined for vn 0 and has to result in a positive v n time reversal invariance is obtained under the condition v n vn for a wall at uniform tem perature the canonical distribution ought to be station ary under the wall collisions together with the hamil tonian dynamics in the interior which indeed leave the canonical distribution invariant this can be obtained by imposing a detailed balance condition requiring that in equilibrium the frequencies of collisions with impact velocities v and v are equal then the number of par ticles coming off the wall with velocity v in equilibrium is the same as under e g specular reflections the aver age number of collisions per unit wall area with velocity between v and v dv is given in general by nc v q dv vnf 1 v q dv 1 with f 1 v q the one particle distribution function in the canonical ensemble the latter is of the form f 1 can v q n q m 2 d 2 exp mv 2 2 2 with d the dimensionality of the system 1 kbt and kb boltzmann s constant hence one may express the detailed balance condition as vn exp mv 2 n 2 dvn v n exp m v n 2 2 dv n 3 http arxiv org abs 1411 2983 v 1 mailto h vanbeijeren uu nl 2 the simplest nontrivial solution of this mapping the in terval 0 to 0 is of the form 5 exp m v n 2 2 1 exp mv 2 n 2 4 or v n 2 m ln 1 exp mv 2 n 2 5 in case the wall temperature is not uniform one simply has to replace by q in this expression notice that this mapping satisfies time reversal invariance this thermostat and variations of it have already been used a few times garrido et al 6 employed it in a simu lation of heat conductivity in one dimensional chains and bosetti and posch used a variant in a study of heat con duction and the corresponding dynamical system proper ties of hard disk systems 7 in this variant the collisions remain specular in direction but the speed is changed in such a way that the desired detailed balance condition is satisfied in both cases the authors observed a rapid approach of the system to the stationary state from eq 4 one easily sees that the thermostat converts distribu tions of the normal velocity with average energy kbt 2 to distributions with average energy kbt 2 and vice versa this by itself unphysical effect no doubt con tributes to the rapid convergence and outside the nar row boundary layers it will not affect the temperature profile nor other system properties in principle the thermostat described here could also be used for solid or glassy systems by confining these between rigid walls however the restriction to classical equations of motion will be problematic for many of these systems the thermostat also offers an alternative to nose hoover thermostats for sampling the canonical ensemble with deterministic dynamics provided the system to be studied can be designed to have a hard wall somewhere in conclusion this paper describes a deterministic ther mostat that is very efficient in equilibrating classical sys tems near thermal walls that can be simulated fast on a computer and is especially useful for investigating
