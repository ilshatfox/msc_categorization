abstract this paper describes a predictive control method to search for unstable periodic orbits of the generalized tent map the invariant set containing periodic orbits is a repelling set with a complicated cantor like structure therefore a simple local sta bilization of the orbit may not be enough to find a periodic orbit due to the small measure of the basin of attraction it is shown that for certain values of the control parameter both the local be havior and the global behavior of solutions change in the controlled system in particular the invariant set enlarges to become an in terval or the entire real axis the computational particularities of using the control system are considered and necessary conditions for the orbit to be periodic are given the question of local asymp totic stability of subcycles of the controlled system s stable cycles is fully investigated and some statistical properties of the subset of the classical cantor middle thirds set that is determined by the periodic points of the generalized tent map are described keywords generalized tent map predictive control periodic or bits local stabilization invariant sets introduction in his seminal paper r lozi noted that numerical computations us ing computers play a central role in analyzing solutions of nonlinear dynamical systems that computer aided proofs are complex and nec essarily require additional special validation of the results 1 never theless numerous studies in fields related to chaotic dynamical systems are confident in the numerical solutions that they found using popular software sometimes without carefully checking the reliability of these results computationally computers store numbers in registers and memory cells with a limited number of digits thus the set of real numbers represented in the machine is discrete and finite irrational numbers and rational numbers with infinite decimal expansions are 1 http arxiv org abs 2111 08904 v 1 2 ayers dmitrishin radunskaya a stokolos and c stokolos rounded to decimal expansions that terminate this can lead to prob lems when attempting to numerically find unstable periodic orbits of discrete chaotic dynamical systems consider the family of chaotic dynamical systems given by the gen eralized tent map 1 xn 1 f xn n 1 2 where 2 f x h 1 2 x 1 2 hx x 1 2 h 1 x x 1 2 x h 2 note that despite the relative simplicity of function 2 equation 1 is of great theoretical importance and has appeared in several applications 2 3 consider the classical tent map given by h 2 note that x 0 2 3 is a fixed point f 2 3 2 3 since f 2 3 2 1 2 3 is an unstable fixed point thus any amount of rounding error will cause an orbit to eventually diverge from this fixed point and we can see this computationally in this article we show how we can correct the computational pro cedure in the problem of finding unstable periodic orbits of a nonlinear discrete system using the tent map as an illustrative example the dynamics of even the simplest nonlinear discrete systems can be quite complex 4 6 such systems are often characterized by extremely unstable motions in phase space which are defined as chaotic 4 in dissipative systems these motions define invariant sets which can be strange attractors or repellers trajectories on such invariant sets have positive lyapunov exponents therefore these trajectories are exponen tially sensitive to the initial conditions unstable periodic orbits are canonical examples of repelling invariant sets and we can get insight into the general study of repellers by considering unstable periodic or bits periodic orbits have a hierarchical structure determined by their length which makes it possible to calculate various characteristics of invariant sets and their subsets for example topological dimension and entropy 7 however when applying numerical methods to search for points along a periodic orbits we encounter a number of fundamental problems due to sensitivity to initial conditions and rounding errors after several calculation steps the results can vary greatly depending on the chosen calculation accuracy the so called butterfly effect occurs search for invariant sets of the generalized tent map 3 even with a real possibility to choose a very high accuracy of calcu lations we will never be able to say with certainty what we actually found a long cycle a pseudo cycle or a strange attractor 1 there are several methods of searching for periodic orbits of a non linear discrete system which can be divided into two groups methods that do not use the correction of the original discrete dynamical sys tem for example the method of interval arithmetic analysis 8 10 or the method connected with the construction of special hamiltonian systems 7 and methods based on local stabilization of an unknown periodic orbit of a given length 11 16 the second group of meth ods is more preferable in the sense that their accuracy increases with the number of iterations due to the correction of the original dynam ical system if we can locally stabilize the orbit with the help of the control action then the trajectories of the system will remain in the neighborhood of the orbit and will be attracted to it i e the periodic orbit will be found by choosing different initial points different pe riodic orbits can be found to solve the problems of stabilization in the search of periodic orbits various control schemes were proposed that use information about the states of the controlled system at previous points in time 17 20 delayed control or about the states of the initial system at future points in time 21 24 predictive control the purpose of this paper is to illustrate the effectiveness of the pre dictive control method using the example of the generalized tent map the invariant sets of the generalized tent map are repellers that have the structure of a cantor set we show that in a controlled system along with a change in the local behavior of solutions the global be havior also changes we describe the invariant sets of the controlled system which are either a single interval or a union of intervals lo cally asymptotically stable periodic orbits are subsets of the invariant set the basins of attraction of these orbits are also discussed the paper is organized as follows in section 1 we present the main result from previous work 24 which substantiates the generalized pre dictive control scheme section 2 poses the problem of finding a cycle of length t and provides necessary and sufficient conditions for the local asymptotic stability of this cycle section 2 presents the main theoretical results in the paper it pro vides conditions under which all solutions of the controlled system are bounded theorem 1 or solutions with initial values from a given 4 ayers dmitrishin radunskaya a stokolos and c stokolos interval are bounded theorem 2 we also show that the cycles do not lose the property of local asymptotic stability in section 3 some computational particularities of using the control system for finding cycles are considered and necessary conditions for the found sequence to be a cycle are given in section 4 using the example of stabiliza tion of cycles of small lengths we consider the relationship between the graphical properties of the original map and the map determined by the controlled system in section 5 the question about local as ymptotic stability of subcycles of the controlled system s stable cycles is fully investigated theorem 3 section 6 studies subsets of the clas sical cantor middle thirds set since any point in the cantor set is a limit of periodic points we can use the controlled system to visualize the cantor set itself we compare the distribution of periodic points of very long cycles to the distribution of points of the first type i e endpoints of the intervals that make up the complement of the cantor set the images in this paper were created using maple and the files that generated them can be found at 25 1 background we consider the discrete system 3 xn 1 f xn xn r m n 1 2 where f x is in general a nonlinear differentiable function from rm to rm it is assumed that this system has one or more unstable t cycles 1 t where all the vectors 1 t are distinct i e j 1 f j j 1 t 1 1 f t vectors in the cycles are called cyclic points and each cycle of length t constitutes a t periodic orbit the multipliers of the unstable cycles are defined as the eigenvalues of the products of jacobi matrices t j 1 f t j 1 of dimension m m at the points of the cycle the matrix t j 1 f t j 1 is called the jacobi matrix of the cycle 1 t the collection of all multipliers 1 m is called the spectrum of the jacobi matrix as a rule the cycles 1 t of system 3 are not known a priori consequently the spectrum is not known either search for invariant sets of the generalized tent map 5 consider the control system 4 xn 1 f 1 xn n j 2 jf j 1 t xn the numbers 1 n are real we can verify that when n j 1 j 1 system 4 also has a cycle 1 t the problem is to choose a parameter n and coefficients 1 n so that the cycle 1 t of system 4 is locally asymptotically stable the following result gives a criterion for stability of the cycles in terms of the multipliers we will see how to use this result to determine a suitable range for the control parameter proposition 1 24 suppose f c 1 and that system 3 has an unstable t cycle with multipliers 1 m then this cycle will be a locally asymptotically stable cycle of system 4 if j r j t d j 1 m where d z c z 1 is an open central unit disc on the com plex plane r n j 1 j j 1 a set u is called invariant for equation 3 if for any x 0 u it follows that f k x 0 u k 1 2 it is shown in 26 that for h 3 the invariant set of equation 1 is the classical cantor set analogously it can be shown that when h 2 the invariant set for equation 1 is a set of the cantor type that is an uncountable closed set with zero lebesgue measure note that each point of the invariant set can be represented in the form j 1 j hj where j 0 h 1 this set includes a countable subset of all periodic points of map 2 if x 0 does not belong to the invariant set then the corresponding sequence f k x 0 k 1 tends to such invariant sets are called repellers of map 2 the problem we address in this paper is the following for given t can we numerically find t periodic points of the tent map 2 as limit points of some iterative scheme 6 ayers dmitrishin radunskaya a stokolos and c stokolos 2 main results the control system and global behavior of the control system trajectories to solve the problem of finding unstable periodic orbits of the tent map we will use the predictive control method which we now describe explicitly along with equation 1 consider the equation 5 xn 1 f xn n 1 2 where f x f x 1 f t x is some real number called the control parameter whose value will be determined later we will call equation 5 the control system for equation 1 the idea is to find the values of that stabilize our target periodic cycles let 1 t be a cycle of the equation 1 of length t since k 1 f t k k then f k f k which means that the cycle of the equation 1 will also be a cycle of equation 5 note that the converse statement is generally not true the multiplier of the equation 1 cycle is defined by the formula f t f 1 since f j h then h t 1 that is any cycle of equation 1 is unstable let us find the value of the multiplier of the same cycle 1 t but for equation 5 from proposition 1 we get that 1 t in what follows we will consider two cases separately 0 and 0 let ht then the condition for local asymptotic stability of the t cycle of equation 5 is ht 1 ht t 1 from which it follows that 6 1 ht 1 h ht 1 ht 1 h ht 1 5 2 if ht then the condition for local asymptotic stability of the equation 5 cycle is ht 1 ht t 1 from which 7 1 2 ht 1 h ht 1 ht 1 h ht 1 1 thus proposition 1 yields the following conditions for asymptotic stability of cycles search for invariant sets of the generalized tent map 7 claim 1 given a t cycle of equation 1 with the multiplier this cycle will be a locally asymptotically stable cycle of equation 5 if in equalities 6 in the case 0 or inequalities 7 when 0 are satisfied if there are locally asymptotically stable cycles in equation 5 then the invariant set of this equation also includes the basins of attraction of these cycles since the basin of attraction of a cycle is an open set its measure is positive however there remains the question about how large this measure is this question is important when doing numerical experiments because we must judiciously choose the initial point to be in the basin of attraction the desired cycle thus as we pass from equation 1 to equation 5 we are ensured that the nature of the periodic orbit the set of points of the cycle changes from a repeller into an attractor for numericaly tractability it is also important to know that we have a basin of attraction of sufficiently large measure next we will establish the properties of invariant sets of equation 5 and the global behavior of its solutions in particular we will show that under the conditions on the control parameter given in claim 1 we have globally attracting invariant sets made up of intervals we state these properties as two theorems one for the case when the multiplier is positive and one when is negative the proofs of the two theorems are broken down into several lemmas each dealing with a specific range of values the two main theorems follow from these lemmas allowing us to find all cycles of arbitrary lengths with any given accuracy theorem 1 case 0 if inequalities ht 1 h ht 1 ht 1 h ht 1 are satisfied then any solution of equation 5 is bounded and its limit set is contained in 0 h 2 more over any t cycle 1 t of this equation for which the quantity f t f 1 is positive is locally asymptotically stable theorem 2 case 0 if the inequalities ht 1 h ht 1 h t ht 1 are satisfied the set 0 h 2 is an invariant set of equation 5 moreover any t cycle 1 t of this equation for which the quantity f t f 1 is negative is locally asymptotically stable theorems 1 and 2 will be proved through a sequence of five lemmas each one dealing with a different sub case lemmas 1 3 divide the 8 ayers dmitrishin radunskaya a stokolos and c stokolos positive multiplier case into three sub cases one where is exactly in the middle of the allowed interval lemma 1 one where is in the lower half of the allowed interval lemma 2 and one where is in the upper half of the allowed interval lemma 3 the remaining two lemmas lemmas 4 and 5 deal with the case of a negative multiplier 0 2 1 proof of theorem 1 throughout the proof to break down the calculations we let the function x x 1 f t x be the intermediary linear combination that appears in the definition of the control function f x given in equation 5 thus f x f x and 0 x 0 suppose 0 and let inequalities 6 be satisfied divide the conditions 6 into three cases i h t ht 1 ii ht 1 h ht 1 h t ht 1 and iii 1 h t ht 1 ht 1 h ht 1 each case is treated in a separate lemma lemma 1 let h t ht 1 then if x 0 0 it follows that f x 0 0 hence f k x 0 0 when k 1 2 if x 0 1 then f x 0 0 hence f k x 0 0 when k 2 3 if x 0 0 1 then f k x 0 k 2 0 1 proof let x 0 0 then f x 0 hx 0 0 f 2 x 0 h 2 x 0 0 f t x 0 h tx 0 find

x 0 f 0 h 1 0 0 hence f 2 x 0 0 the last case remains if x 0 0 1 then there is a k 0 such that f k x 0 0 for all k k 0 or f k x 0 k 2 0 1 for all k search for invariant sets of the generalized tent map 9 the case ht 1 h ht 1 h t ht 1 is considered in a similar way lemma 2 let ht 1 h ht 1 h t ht 1 then if x 0 0 or x 0 1 f k x 0 k 0 when x 0 0 1 either f k x 0 k 0 or f k x 0 k 1 0 1 proof let x 0

which f x 0 x 0 x 0 then f k x 0 k x 0 k 0 let x 0 1 then f x 0 h 1 x 0 0 f t x 0 h t 1 x 0 0 x 0 1 f t x 0 x 0 1 x 0 h t x 0 1 x 0 1 then f x 0 f 0 h 1 0 0 hence f 2 x 0 f x 0 f x 0 f k x 0 k 1 f x 0 k 0 let x 0 0 1 if for some k 0 f k 0 x 0 0 or f k 0 x 0 1 then f k x 0 k 0 otherwise f k x 0 k 1 0 1 the lemma is proved the case h t ht 1 ht 1 h ht 1 remains lemma 3 let h t ht 1 ht 1 h ht 1 in this case if h 2 h 2 x 0 h 2 then 8 h 2 h 2 f k x 0 h 2 k 1 2 if x 0 h 2 or x 0 h 2 h 2 there exists a number k 0 0 such that inequalities 8 are satisfied for all k greater than k 0 10 ayers dmitrishin radunskaya a stokolos and c stokolos proof let x 0 0 then f x 0 hx 0 0 f t x 0 h tx 0 0 ht ht 1 x 0 the inequality ht ht 1 ht 1 h ht 1 is equivalent to 1 h ht ht 1 0 from which it follows that 0 0 x 0

inequality 0 f k 0 x 0 h 2 is satisfied summing up the four cases above we get that when h 2 h 2 x 0 h 2 inequalities 8 hold if x 0 h 2 or x 0 h 2 h 2 then inequalities 8 will be satisfied starting from some iterate xk the lemma is proved the assertion of theorem 1 follows from claim 1 and lemmas 1 2 and 3 2 2 proof of theorem 2 let us now pass to the study of the global behavior of the t cycles

lemmas 4 and 5 note that when the inequalities ht ht 1 ht 1 h ht 1 are satis fied the invariant set of equation 5 will no longer be a segment but will be the union of a finite or countable number of intervals and the measure of this set may be small theorems 1 and 2 are illustrated in section 4 for the case h 3 and t 2 3 computational particularities of using the control system in this section we introduce the residuals un f xn 1 f t xn f xn and u n xn t xn whose rate of decay allows us to compare solutions of system 5 to solutions of system 1 as well as the t periodicity of the solutions let us consider the computational particularities of the iterative scheme 5 for finding the cycles of equation 1 for cycles with pos itive multipliers it is theoretically possible to take any number from the interval ht 1 h ht 1 ht 1 h ht 1 as the control parameter however if this 14 ayers dmitrishin radunskaya a stokolos and c stokolos parameter belongs to the half interval ht 1 h ht 1 h t ht 1 then the fixed point will have a fairly large basin of attraction this will be illustrated geometrically below therefore if we want to find true period t cycles it is reasonable to choose the control parameter closer to ht 1 h ht 1 for cycles with negative multipliers the control parameter can be taken from the interval ht 1 h ht 1 ht ht 1 since the basin of attraction of a given cycle can be quite small the initial value x 0 should belong to the nodes of a sufficiently dense grid of the interval 0 1 in order to find the largest possible number of cycles note that for large values of t the control parameter is close to one and the value 1 is close to zero in this case the lengths of the intervals of possible changes in the control parameter are equal to 1 h ht 1 or 1 h ht 1 i e as t grows they tend to zero exponentially therefore although the method suggested above for determining cycles theoretically allows us to solve the stated problem numerically practical questions remain when can we rely on numerical solutions how can we control numerical results what calculation accuracy should be chosen in practice intermediate calculations should be introduced to control the results let the sequence xn n 1 be an orbit of the system given by equation 5 and let the quantity 1 have the order of magnitude 10 p where p is large enough then the first checkpoint will be the estimate of the residual un f xn 1 f t xn f xn if the sequence xn tends to an orbit of system 1 then the sequence un tends to zero however if the sequence xn does not tend to an orbit of system 1 then the residual can have the order of magnitude 1 10 p i e be close to zero to be sure that the residual tends to zero we have to choose the calculation accuracy 10 p 1 where p 1 should be significantly greater than p then the first point of control will be the condition un 10 p 1 n n 1 the second checkpoint is the check of periodicity of the numerical solution u n xn t xn 10 p 1 n n 1 of course it is also necessary to check that t is a proper cycle of system 1 and not a subcycle i e a cycle of shorter length search for invariant sets of the generalized tent map 15 the checkpoints give necessary conditions for the sequence xn to be a t cycle of equation 1 the effectiveness of these necessary con ditions is that they are quite simple to check which we illustrate in the following example example consider the problem of finding 5 cycles of equation 1 when h 4 choose two initial conditions and for each of them find one 5 cycle with a positive and negative multiplier respectively set x 0

as n increases the periodicity condition u xn 5 xn 10 15 holds for all four schemes starting from n 43 we note that there are 6 distinct cycles of period 5 but we only show four of these here to find the remaining two cycles we would judiciously select two more values of x 0 and all cycles of any length can be found in a similar fashion the limitation is the calculation accuracy which should be chosen to be approximately h 1 05 t since h f x figure 3 left panel shows the cyclic points of four cycles of length 100 the accuracy of calcula tions was taken 1065 for negative multipliers the

y f 2 x are drawn in black in the left panel a 9 10 in the right panel b 9 8 graphs of the functions y x and y f 2 x are shown in grey in a we see that the derivative of 2 x is 0 at the two fixed points of f 2 that are in the proper period 2 cycle of f showing that these points are super stable fixed points of f 2 by contrast in b the period 2 points of f are now unstable while the two fixed points of f are super stable consider the global behavior of solutions of equation 5 at ht ht 1 the function x ht ht 1 x 1 ht 1 f t x does not decrease on indeed x ht ht ht 1 0 x 2 ht ht 1 x where is the set on which the function f t x decreases note that the sets on which f t x and x are increasing coincide in partic ular the function x increases when x 1 2 1 1 h 1 2 ht 1 from 1 2 ht 1 h 1 to h 2 the point 1 2 1 2 ht 1 h 1 is the mini mum of the function f t x on 0 1 figure 8 shows the graphs of the functions f t x and x in the case h 3 t 3 let x 1 2 1 1 h 1 2 ht 1 t 1 denote x 1 1 h ht then 1 2 ht 1 h 2 h 2 compute f t x the first iterate remains search for invariant sets of the generalized tent map 21 figure 8 graphs of the functions f t x sea green and x black when h 3 and t 3 note that x and f t are increasing on the same intervals and x is constant where f t x is decreasing greater than 1 2 the second iterate is less than 1 2 and all subsequent iterates increase to f x 1 ht 1 1 2 f 2 x ht 2 1 2 f t x this implies that the equation h t ht 1 1 1 h ht 1 ht 1 1 2 has only one root on 1 2 ht 1 h 2 h 2 which we denote by 1 4 1 4 ht 1 2 ht 1 since 1 2 h t 1 ht 1 1 2 and 1 1 h 1 2 ht 1 ht ht 1 h ht 1 1 2 then in the interval x 1 2 1 1 h 1 2 ht 1 there is exactly one root of the equation x 1 2 namely x 1 1 h ht 3 4 1 2 h 1 4 ht this means that the function f x f x does not decrease on the interval 0 x does not increase on x 1 f x h 2 and f x f 1 1 2 ht 1 h t ht 1 when x 1 1 2 ht 1 the graph of the function f x when h 3 and t 4 is shown in figure 9 on the same figure we plot the corresponding function x on the interval 0 1 there are 2 t 1 disjoint intervals on which the function f x is constant this means that there are 2 t 1 periodic points where f x 0 these points are t periodic points of the map f x with negative multipliers generally speaking the proper period of these points may be less than t if t is not a prime number the question of stability of these so called subcycles is considered in the next section the fact that the derivative is zero means that the sequence defined by iterating equation 5 converges very quickly to these cyclic points i e they are super stable in particular if x 0 x 22 ayers dmitrishin radunskaya a stokolos and c stokolos b figure 9 graphs of the functions f x black and x blue when h 3 and t 4 since f x f x f and are constant

of t cycles of any given period since t periodic points are fixed points of ft x they will be points of intersection of the graph of y ft x and the graph y x these two graphs intersect exactly 2 t times for x 0 1 two points of intersection correspond to the fixed points of f at x 0 and search for invariant sets of the generalized tent map 23 x 1 1 h 1 if t is a prime number then there are exactly 2 t 2 t cycles of length t by fermat s little theorem if t is prime 2 t 2 is divisible by t and thus 2 t 2 t is an integer if t s j 1 j j where 1 s are distinct prime numbers then there are exactly 1 t 2 t s j 1 2 t j s i j 1 i j 2 t i j 1 s 2 t 1 s cycles of the length t the fact that the given fraction is an integer is a special case of gauss s theorem see for example 27 p 84 let be a factor of the number t and let the t cycle of the system given by equation 5 be locally asymptotically stable the task is to find out which cycles of the same system will be locally asymptot ically stable it turns out that the answer depends on the parity of t theorem 3 let condition 7 be satisfied i e t cycles of equa tion 1 for which the multipliers are positive are locally asymptotically stable cycles of equation 5 then all the cycles of equation 1 for which the multipliers are positive and all the cycles of equation 1 for which the multipliers are negative and the number t is even are locally asymptotically stable cycles of equation 5 let condition 7 be satisfied i e t cycles of equation 1 for which the multipliers are negative are locally asymptotically stable cycles of equation 5 then all the cycles of equation 1 for which the mul tipliers are negative and the number t is odd are locally asymptotically stable cycles of equation 5 proof let 1 t be a t cycle and 1 a cycle of the system given by equation 1 let t f t f 1 f f 1 be the corresponding multipliers of these cycles these cycles will also be cycles of equation 5 we assume that the condition for local asymptotic stability of the t cycle of equation 5 10 t 1 t t 1 24 ayers dmitrishin radunskaya a stokolos and c stokolos is satisfied let us find the multiplier of the cycle of equation 5 let as before f x f x 1 f t x and p t calculate f j f j 1 f f 1 p f j 1 p j 1 then the multiplier of the cycle of equation 5 equals f f 1 1 p and accordingly the condition for local asymptotic stability of the cycle of equation 5 is 11 1 p 1 since t h t h the following cases are possible a t 0 0 then t p p is odd t p p is even b t 0 0 then t p for any p c t 0 0 then t p p is odd t p p is even d t 0 0 then t p for any p inequality 10 implies inequality 11 if and only if one of the con ditions holds t 0 0 p is odd t 0 0 p is even t 0 0 for any p the first condition is possible for the param eters that satisfy inequalities 6 the second and third conditions are possible for the parameters that satisfy inequalities 7 whence the conclusion of the theorem follows consider again the example of stabilization of 5 cycles from section 4 then besides locally asymptotically stable 5 cycles the fixed points at 0 when ht 0 4 h ht 1 and 0 8 when ht 0 4 h ht 1 will also be stable the initial points x 0 0 001 and x 0 0 801 are in the basins of attraction of the corresponding fixed points and their orbits will therefore converge to the fixed points rather than to one of the true period 5 cycles periodic and fixed points are shown in figure 10 6 distribution of cyclic points and visualization of the cantor set as noted above the invariant set of equation 1 at h 3 is the classical cantor middle thirds set however due to its strong instabil ity it is impossible to visualize the points of this set using equation 1 search for invariant sets of the generalized tent map 25 figure 10 points of 5 cycles and fixed points of the tent map where h 4 in the left panel a 5 cycle with positive multiplier blue and the non zero fixed point red are stabilized using ht 0 4 h ht 1 in the right panel a 5 cycle with negative multiplier green and the fixed point at 0 are stabilized using ht 0 4 h ht 1 to put this example in the context of theorem 3 we note that in this case t 5 and 1 so that p t 5 is odd recall that the cantor set can be defined as those real numbers in 0 1 whose ternary expansions consist only of 0 s and 2 s the cantor set is characterized by two types of points the points that are end points of the open intervals that are adjacent to the cantor set are called points of the first type these are points which terminate in all 0 s or all 2 s when written in ternary expansion they take the form p 3 k for some natural numbers p and k while all the other points of the set are called points of the second type points of the first type are solutions of the equations f k x 1 for k 1 2 the set of points of the first type is countable when x 1 2 and in the cantor set so that is it s first digit in ternary expansion is 0 the tent map acts as a right shift map on the ternary expansion if x 1 2 the tent map acts on the ternary expansion by swapping the 2 s and 0 s and then acting as a shift map among the points of the second type we can select a subset consisting of all periodic points of the system given by equation 1 they are obtained as the union of all the roots of the equations f k x x k 1 2 the set of periodic points of the map 2 is also countable points whose ternary expansion is peri odic will themselves be periodic because of the way the tent map acts 26 ayers dmitrishin radunskaya a stokolos and c stokolos as a shift on the ternary expansions thus there are periodic points arbitrarily close to points of the first type of the cantor set the following question arises how are the periodic points of one orbit of a given period t distributed through the cantor set more precisely how uniformly do the periodic points of the orbit of a given period t fill the cantor set we do not consider the analytical solution of this problem in this paper but we provide some examples simulating the density functions for the distribution of periodic point and we compare them graphically with the analogous function for a random sample of elements from the set of points of the first type in the cantor set let us take for example the period t 1009 with an accuracy 10 525 initial value x 0 0 555 and values for the control parameter ht 0 6 h ht 1 we will get 2 t 2018 cyclic points we then simulate the density function for the distribution of the cyclic points set figure 11 a the graph shows that the estimated periodic points are not quite evenly distributed in the cantor set let us now find two hundred orbits with the period t 1009 i e we get 20180 cyclic points surprisingly the graph of the simulated density function for the new set of points figure 11 b does not differ much from the plot in the previous case finally let us plot the density function for the distribution of randomly selected 200000 points of the first type of the cantor set for this purpose represent a subset of the points of the first type of the cantor set in their ternary expansion s n j 1 j 2 3 j where j 0 1 if n 25 the maximum number of possible points is 225 let us randomly choose values for j either zero or one and thus construct 200000 points next we graph the distribution of the resulting set figure 12 comparison of the graphs in figures 11 12 shows that the points of the first type constructed by the method outlined above are distributed more evenly on the cantor set 7 conclusions a general predictive control framework was developed in 24 for find ing a given set of periodic orbits by making them locally stable this suggests a solution to the problem of numerically describing invariant sets 1 of nonlinear dynamical systems since periodic orbits are often dense in these invariant sets 1 we consider the largest bounded set such that f search for invariant sets of the generalized tent map 27 a b figure 11 the graph of the distribution density func tion of the set of cyclic points of two and two hundred 1009 periodic orbits of map 2 at h 3 figure 12 graph of the distribution density function of the set of 200000 random points of the first type of the cantor set note that the distribution is more uniform across the bins of the histogram since the periodic orbits themselves are repelling sets the problem is separated in two parts a local stabilization of periodic orbits of a given period which could be fairly large and then selection of an initial point in the basin of attraction of the stabilized periodic orbit if the invariant set is a global attractor then all trajectories are bounded and therefore most initial points are in the basin of attraction of one of the stabilized periodic orbits 28 ayers dmitrishin radunskaya a stokolos and c stokolos if the invariant set is repelling then the analogous problem turns out to be much more complicated simple local stability of the controlled orbit is not sufficient due to the fact that its basin of attraction can have a small measure and a very complicated structure for example it might not be simply connected or it may have a fractal boundary the orbits of most initial points will go to infinity therefore the problem of choosing an initial point in the basin of attraction of a stabilized orbit becomes significant however the method of generalized predictive control used to sta bilize the orbit has an important characteristic in addition to the local asymptotic stability of the orbits of controlled system the rest of the orbits remain bounded for a sufficiently large set of initial val ues in this paper we showed that for the generalized tent map it is possible to ensure that all solutions are bounded the global behavior of solutions for the generalized logistic map the generalized lozi 28 he non 29 ikeda 30 elhadj sprott 31 maps etc is somewhat more complicated for such systems we conjecture that it is necessary to choose the control parameter as a function of the current state of the system investigation of the global behavior of the controlled systems solutions for these maps is the task for future research 8 acknowledgment the authors wish to thank andrew
