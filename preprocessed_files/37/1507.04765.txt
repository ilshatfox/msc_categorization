the pentagram map on grassmannians rau l felipe cimat guanajuato me xico gloria mar beffa mathematics department university of wisconsin madison march 8 2018 abstract in this paper we define a generalization of the pentagram map to a map on twisted polygons in the grassmannian space gr n mn we define invariants of grassmannian twisted polygons under the natural action of sl nm invariants that define coordinates in the moduli space of twisted polygons we then prove that when written in terms of the moduli space coordinates the pentagram map is preserved by a certain scaling the scaling is then used to construct a lax representation for the map that can be used for integration 1 introduction in the last five years there has been a lot of activity around the study of the pentagram map its generalizations and some related maps the map was originally defined by richard schwartz over two decades ago 10 and after a dormant period it came back with the publication of 8 where the authors proved that the map when defined on twisted polygons was completely integrable the literature on the subject is quite sizable by now as different authors proved that the original map on closed polygons was also completely integrable 9 13 worked on generalizations to polygons in higher dimensions and their integrability 1 2 5 6 and studied the integrability of other related maps 11 7 the subject has also branched into geometry and combinatorics this bibliography refers only to some geometric generalizations of the map and is by no means exhaustive the success of the map is perhaps due to its simplicity the original map is defined on closed convex polygons in rp 2 the map takes a convex polygon in the projective plane to the one formed by the intersection of the lines that join every other vertex as in the figure the mathematical consequences of such a simple construction are astonishing in particular the pentagram map is a double discretization of the boussinesq equation a well known completely integrable system modeling waves see 8 integrability is studied not for the map itself but for the map induced by it on the moduli space of planar projective polygons that is on the space of equivalence classes of polygons up to a projective transformation in 8 the authors defined it on twisted polygons or polygons with a monodromy after a periodn and proved that the map induced on the moduli space is completely integrable the map is equivariant raulf cimat mx maribeff math wisc edu corresponding author 1 ar x iv 1 50 7 04 76 5 v 1 m at h ph 1 6 ju l 20 15 under projective transformations thus the existence of the moduli induced map is guaranteed in this paper we look at the generalization of the map from the grassmannian point of view if we think of rp 2 as the grassmaniann gr 1 3 that is the space of homogeneous lines in r 3 then the polygon would be a polygon in the grassmannian under the usual action of sl 2 1 with each side representing a homogeneous plane as in the picture the case of rpm 1 was studied in 1 where the authors proved that the generalized pentagram map was integrable for low dimensions and conjectured that a scaling existed for the map that ensured the existence of a lax pair and its integrability the conjecture was proved in 6 we can also consider this case as gr 1 m m 3 from this point of view it is natural to investigate the generalized map defined on polygons in gr n mn where m and n are positive integers m 3 in this paper we define and study the generalization of the pentagram map to twisted grassmannian polygons in gr n mn m 3 figure 1 the pentagram map on pentagons in gr 1 3 the first step is to define the map on the moduli space of grassmannian twisted polygons that is on the space of equivalence classes of grassmannian twisted poly gons under the classical action of sl m 1 n n that generalizes the projective action of psl m on rpm 1 we do that by carefully studying the moduli space and finding generic coordinates that can be used to write the map in a convenient way as in the case of the original pentagram map the map can only be defined generi cally the coordinates are found with the use of a discrete moving frame constructed through a normalization process similar to the one described in 4 the classification of invariants under this action is as far as we know unknown and it is completed in section 3 in section 4 we study the case m 2 s in a parallel fashion to the study in 6 we proceed to write the pentagram map on the moduli space in the chosen coordinates and we show that it can be written as the solution of a linear system of equations we use that description and cramer s rule to prove that the map is invariant under a certain scaling as it was the case in 6 a critical part of the study is a fundamen tal lemma that decomposes the coefficient matrix of the system into terms that are homogeneous with respect to the scaling this is lemma 4 for the even dimensional case and lemma 9 for the odd dimensional one the proofs of the rest of the results are supported by those two lemmas once the invariance under scaling is proved the construction of a lax representation is immediate when we introduce the scaling into a natural parameter free lax representation that exists for any map induced on the moduli space by a map on polygons in section 5 we prove the case m 2 s 1 2 2 definitions and notations let gr p q be the set of all p dimensional subspaces of v rq or v cq each l gr p q can be represented by a matrix xl of size q p such that the columns form a basis for l we denote this relation by l xl clearly l xl xld for any d gl p and the representation is not unique hence gr p q can be viewed as the space of equivalence classes of q p matrices where two matrices are equivalent if their columns generate the same subspace an element of this class xl is called a lift of l the name reflects gr p q admitting the structure of a homogeneous space of dimension p q p indeed consider the lie group sl q p represented by block matrices of the form aq p q p bq p p cp q p ep p let h be the subspace defined by bq p p 0 one can show that sl q p p h is isomorphic to gr p q and the natural action of sl q p p on gr p q is given by g x gx consider gr n mn for any positive integers n m and let sl m 1 n n gr n mn gr n mn be the natural action of the group sl mn on gr n mn a twisted n gon in gr n mn is a map z gr n mn such that k n m k for all k z and for some m sl mn the matrix m is called the monodromy of the polygon and n is the period we will also denote an n gon by lk where lk k let x xk be an arbitrary lift for an n gon lk with monodromy m and choose x so it is also twisted that is xn k mxk for all k for any discrete closed n polygon d dk in gl n i e satisfying dk n dk we have that xd xkdk is also a lift for the same polygon with the same monodromy m let us denote by pn the moduli space of twisted n gons in gr n mn that is the space of equivalence classes of twisted polygons under the natural action of sl mn we will also denote by pln the moduli space of n gons in rmn n or cmn n wherever the lifts live under the linear action of sl mn an gon lk is called regular if the matrix k xk xk 1 xk m 2 xk m 1 satisfies the following condition det k xk xk 1 xk m 2 xk m 1 6 0 1 for any k z and any lift x clearly it suffices to check the condition for one particular lift in other words the columns of the matrix constitute a basis of rmn or cmn for all k z 3 the moduli space of twisted polygons in gr n mn in this section we will prove that the moduli space of regular twisted polygons pn is a n m 1 n dimensional manifold and will define local coordinates assume lk lk gr n mn is a regular twisted n gon and let xk be any twisted lift by dimension counting and given that is regular for any k 0 n 1 we can find n n matrices aik i 0 m 1 such that xk m xm k 1 a m 1 k xk 1 a 1 k xka 0 k 2 notice that if k is as in 1 then k 1 k on on on a 0 k in on on a 1 k on in on a m 2 k on on in a m 1 k kqk 3 3 where qk is the matrix above using 1 this implies that det a 0 k 6 0 for all k notice that n 0 q 0 q 1 qn 1 thus if 0 i the monodromy is given by m q 0 qn 1 and for other choices m 0 q 0 qn 1 1 0 thus only the conjugation class of monodromy of the system defined by the matrices qk k 0 n 1 is well defined not the monodromy itself theorem 1 assume m and n are coprime then for any regular twisted n gon there exists a lift v vk such that det vk vk 1 vk m 1 1 4 for any k 0 n 1 and such that if aik are given as in 2 then 1 a 0 k diagonal r 1 k r s k where each rsk is an upper triangular toeplitz matrix with det a 0 k 1 2 we can choose v such that all am 1 k s entries for any k are generated by n n 2 n 1 independent functions the remaining n n 1 m entries of aik i 6 0 m 1 together with those above define a coordinate system on pn proof let x xk be any twisted lift of the twisted polygon we will call vk xkdk and show that we can find a closed polygon in gl n dk such that the conditions of the theorem are satisfied if vk xkdk we have vk vk m 1 xk xk m 1 diag dk dk 1 dk m 1 5 first of all we will show that condition 4 determines the values of k det dk for any k indeed from 5 we have that k m 1 i k i zk where zk det xk xk m 1 1 is determined by the choice of lift these equa tions determine k uniquely whenever n and m are coprime as shown in 6 let us call bik the invariants in 2 associated to xk and a i k those associated to vk then substituting in 2 we have that aik d 1 k ib i kdk m 6 let p pk be a closed polygon in gl n and define the rth m product to be the product of every m matrices starting at pr until we get to the end of the period that is pr pr jm m prpr mpr 2 m pr jm with r j 1 m n if n and m are coprime by repeatedly adding m to the subindex we can reach all n elements in pk that is if n and m are coprime and n mq s with 0 s m then all pk k 0 1 n 1 appear in the product m p 0 p 0 pn s m pm s m pn s m m ps pn m m 7 to see this one can picture a circle with n marked points where we locate pj if we join with a segment every m points we are sure to join all points with segments before closing the polygon if the polygon closes leaving some vertices untouched it means that a multiple of n can be divided into the union of disjoint orbits formed by joining every m points this would imply that n and m are not co prime let us call ar m a 0 r a 0 r a 0 r m a 0 n r s m a 0 s r a 0 n m r m 8 4 we can see directly that ar m a 0 r 1 ara 0 r for all r once more if n and m are coprimes this property guarantees that all ar have the same jordan form which we will call j finally notice that if br m b 0 r then ar d 1 r brdr 9 let us choose dr to be the matrix that conjugates br to its jordan normal form j so that ar will all be in jordan form we can choose an order in the eigenvalues for example from smallest to largest to ensure that the matrix is unique up to a factor that commutes with j it is known that if a matrix commutes with a jordan form matrix it must be block diagonal diagonal r 1 rs where each rs is a toepliz matrix upper triangular whenever the corresponding jordan block is of the form 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 or it is diagonal if the jordan block is diagonal thus dk are unique up to a block diagonal matrix of this form since bk m b 0 k 1 bkb 0 k we have that ak m j d 1 k mbk mdk m d 1 k m b 0 k 1 bkb 0 kdk m d 1 k m b 0 k 1 dkd 1 k bkdkd 1 k b 0 kdk m a 0 k 1 aka 0 k a 0 k 1 ja 0 k for all k therefore since a 0 k commutes with the jordan normal form it must be a toeplitz matrix of the form stated in the theorem for all k finally dk is unique up to a matrix commuting with j lets call it qk we now turn our attention to the transformation of bm 1 k under the change of lifting namely am 1 k q 1 k m 1 b m 1 k qk m 10 where b m 1 k d 1 k m 1 b m 1 k dk m dk found above and qr toeplitz and commuting with j how to determine which entries generate the others depend very much on the particular point in the grassmannian in the generic case qr will all be diagonal we will next describe the process generically using 10 we see that am 1 k m 1 a m 1 k m 2 a m 1 n k m q 1 k bm 1 k m 1 b m 1 k m 2 b m 1 n k m qk for k 0 n 1 before we describe the normalizations that will generate the syzygies we recall that the determinants of qk are determined by 4 for any k 0 n 1 whenever n and m are coprime let us call det dk k the last round of normalizations will be chosen by equating those entries in place i i 1 i 1 2 m 1 with the entry 2 1 if we denote by qk diag q 1 k q n k and we denote the entries of bk bm 1 k m 1 b m 1 k m 2 b m 1 n k m 5 by bki j then these normalizations result in equations of the form qi 1 k qik bki i 1 q 2 k q 1 k bk 1 2 11 for i 1 n 1 and q 1 k q 2 k bk 2 1 q 2 k q 1 k bk 1 2 12 equation 12 solves for q 2 k in terms of q 1 k if b 1 2 b 2 1 is not positive we would need to choose different normalizations and substituting it in 11 we get an expression for any qik in terms of q 1 k since det qk det d 1 k k where dk was determined in the normalization of b 0 k q 1 k is also determined these last normalizations will produce as many syzygies in the entries in bm 1 k linear or quadratic as indicated in the statement of the theorem the fact that the entries of qk k 0 n 1 generate all other invariants of polygons in gr n mn is a consequence of the work in 4 remark 2 it is very clear that these last normalizations could be chosen in many different ways we could make entries constant for example or we could choose a different block or relate entries from different blocks not all choices will work for us and in order to be able to prove scaling invariance of the map it is important that we choose the equations to be homogeneous in the entries of brk it is also simpler although not necessary if we choose entries from one block only to define the equations the choice of bm 1 k versus b r k r 6 0 m 1 is just more convenient but we could choose any other r 6 0 instead 4 the pentagram map on gr n 2 sn 4 1 definition of the map next we define the pentagram map for the grassmannian gr n 2 sn for s 2 the dimension of gr n 2 sn is clearly 2 s 1 n 2 let x xk be a lift of a regular n gon in gr n 2 sn and define the following subspaces k xk xk 2 xk 2 s 1 xk 2 s and k xk 1 xk 3 xk 2 s 3 xk 2 s 1 note that dim k s 1 n and dim k sn therefore generically dim k k n definition 3 let lk be a twisted n gon in g n 2 sn let t be the map taking the n gon to the unique twisted n gon whose vertices have a lift of the form t xk k k notice that this is independent from the choice of the lift x we call t the grassmannian pentagram map notice that we are abusing notation by calling t both the map on polygons and their lifts we will go further and use the letter t to denote the image of other data associated to in t invariants frames etc it is immediate to check that t is also twisted with the same monodromy as using the fact that n k m k and n k m k next we will define this map in the moduli space of polygons as defined by the invariants in our previous section we will keep on using the letter t defining t pn pn we will specify the domain if needed let us assume that v vk is the lift defined in theorem 1 for a polygon assume vk 2 s vka 0 k vk 1 a 1 k vk 2 s 1 a 2 s 2 k vk 2 s 1 a 2 s 1 k 13 6 as in 2 for 2 s matrices a 0 k a 1 k a 2 s 1 k of size n n and with the properties described in theorem 1 using the fact that t vk k we know that generically there exist matrices c j i such t vk vkc 0 k vk 2 c 2 k vk 2 sc 2 s k 14 if we now use the relation 13 we can replace vk 2 s in 14 and arrive to the following expression for t vk t vk vkc 0 k vk 2 c 2 k vk 2 s 2 c 2 s 2 k vka 0 k vk 1 a 1 k vk 2 s 1 a 2 s 2 k vk 2 s 1 a 2 s 1 k c 2 sk vk c 0 k a 0 kc 2 s k vk 1 a 1 kc 2 s k vk 2 c 2 k a 2 kc 2 s k vk 2 s 1 a 2 s 1 k c 2 s k since we also assumed that t vk k then c 2 rk a 2 r k c 2 s k 0 for r 0 s 1 and t vk vk 1 a 1 k vk 3 a 3 k vk 2 s 3 a 2 s 3 k vk 2 s 1 a 2 s 1 k c 2 sk 15 although the matrix c 2 sk seems to be arbitrary it is uniquely determined by the fact that the right hand side of 15 not only for k but also for k 1 k 2 s 1 must be a lift for the image polygon t with the same properties as those found in theorem 1 once c 2 sk are chosen that way we will be able to find the image of the matrices a j i under the map t as follows let us call c 2 s k k so that we can write t vk krk k with k vk vk 1 vk 2 vk 2 s 1 rk on a 1 k on a 3 k on a 2 s 1 k 16 and where k are uniquely chosen so that t vk is the lift of the image polygon described in theorem 1 example 1 in particular 15 implies that when s 2 the pentagram map takes of following form t vk vk 1 a 1 k xk 3 a 3 k k vk vk 1 vk 2 vk 3 on a 1 k on a 3 k k krk k for all k z extending the map t using as usual the pullback we have that t k t vk t vk 2 s 1 k rk k rkrk 1 k 1 rk 1 rk 2 k 2 rk 2 s 2 rk 2 s 1 k 2 s 1 where rk r qkqk 1 qk r and qk is given as in 3 this expression can be written as t k knk k 17 where nk rk rkrk 1 rk 1 rk 2 rk 2 s 2 rk 2 s 1 18 7 and k k on on on k 1 on on on k 2 s 1 19 one can recognize equations 3 and 52 that is k 1 kqk t k knk k 20 as a parameter free lax representation for the map t the compatibility conditions are given by t qk 1 k n 1 k qknk 1 k 1 21 the last block column of this equation defines the map t on the moduli space of grassmannian polygons written in coordinates given by the invariants a j i the ques tion we will resolve in the next subsection is how to introduce an spectral parameter in 20 4 2 a lax representation for the pentagram map on gr n 2 sn in this section we will prove that one can introduce a parameter in 20 in such a way that 21 will be independent from this will define a true lax representation that can be used for integration of the map as it was done in 6 we will prove that the map t is invariant under the scaling a 2 r 1 k a 2 r 1 k a 2 r k a 2 r k 22 for any r 0 1 s 1 and any k this implies that all entries of these n n matrix scale equally this will involve several steps let us denote the block columns of 18 by fr so that fk rk and fk rk 1 rk qkqk 1 qk 1 rk 23 1 2 with r as in 16 our first lemma will allow us to decompose the block columns of nr into homogeneous terms according to 22 the lemma is almost identical to lemma 3 1 in 6 let us denote by the matrix on on on on in on on on on in on on on on in on 24 where in is the n n identity matrix let us also denote by t the shift operator namely t vk vk 1 this shift operator can trivially be extended to invariants using t aik a i k 1 and to functions depending on the invariants using the pullback we can also extend it to matrices whose entries are invariants by applying it to each entry as it is customary lemma 4 let fk be given as in 23 then there exist n n matrices j i such that fk 2 r 1 fk 2 r 1 2 2 r 1 gk 2 fk 2 1 r 0 fk 2 r 2 1 2 r g k 2 1 25 for 1 where g k 2 1 pk t gk 2 m t gk 2 2 1 2 r t 2 2 r 1 2 1 0 t gk 2 m 26 8 with pk a 0 k on a 2 k on am 2 k on 27 and gk 2 2 t g k 2 1 2 22 r 1 t 2 1 2 r gk fk rk 28 by am we mean the last n n block entry of a matrix a from now on we will simplify our notation by denoting fk simply by f we will introduce the subindex k only if its removal creates confusion proof first of all notice that the last column of q in 3 is given by p r as in 27 and 16 notice also that from the definition in 23 we have f qt f 1 we proceed by induction first of all since f r f 1 qt f qr 1 p r am 11 r 1 fa m 1 1 pa m 1 1 r 1 we simply need to call g 1 pa m 1 1 r 1 and 1 0 a m 1 1 t f m let s do the first even case also f 2 qt f 1 q t g 1 t fam 12 f 1 a m 1 2 t g 1 and we call g 2 t g 1 notice that qt g 1 t g 1 since the last block of g 1 vanishes as indicated by the hat now assume f 2 r 1 f 2 r 1 2 2 r 1 g 2 then f 2 1 qt f 2 r 1 qt f 2 r 1 t 2 2 r 1 qt g 2 since qt g 2 p t g 2 m r t g 2 m t g 2 and r f if g 2 1 p t g 2 m t g 2 2 1 2 r t 2 2 r 1 r 1 2 1 0 t g 2 m then we have f 2 1 r 0 f 2 r 2 1 2 r g 2 1 looking into the even case we have that f 2 2 qt f 2 1 r 0 qt f 2 rt 2 12 r qt g 2 1 and since f 2 r 1 qt f 2 r and qt g 2 1 t g 2 1 if we call g 2 2 t g 2 1 2 22 r 1 t 2 1 2 r we prove the lemma 9 once we have this lemma we can identify homogeneous terms in the expansion of block columns indeed notice that r and p are homogeneous of degree 1 and 0 respectively with respect to the scaling since the shift clearly preserves the degree from the statement of the lemma we have that both g k 2 r 1 andg 2 r are homogeneous of degree 1 for any r likewise r 0 are also homogeneous of degree 1 for any r from its definition and since all others are obtained by shifting these they are also therefore if we denote g f iteratively applying the lemma we have that fr are in all cases a combination of g 2 r and g 2 r 1 for the different values of r with different types of factors of the form j i each of degree 1 one can also clearly see that if the columns of fr generate r nm for r 0 1 m 1 them the columns of g 2 r and g 2 r 1 r 0 s 1 will also generate the same space since the change of basis matrix will be upper triangular with ones down the diagonal this new basis will be crucial in the calculations that follow finally a comment as to the reason for our notation notice that both g 2 and g 2 1 have alternative zero and non zero clocks with g 2 starting with a zero block and g 2 1 starting with a nonzero block we are keeping that marked not only by the subindex but also by a hat since as calculations become more involved it helps to have them be visibly different it shows that the entire space can be written as a direct sum of two orthogonal subspaces one generated by the block columns with hats and one generated by those without hats next assume that we drop the k factor and define t vk krk define further cik t a i k as given by the following compatibility formula which is 21 after removing k t qk n 1 k qknk 1 29 notice that cik will need to be normalized by k before we can declare it to be t a i k let us call ak the last block column in qk the ith block will be a i 1 k then choosing the last block column in both sides of the equation t ak n 1 k qkt fk 2 s 1 n 1 k fk 2 s which can be written as nkt ak fk 2 s 30 thus t ak can be interpreted as the solution of the linear equation 30 this will be crucial in what follows theorem 5 the matrices cik are homogeneous with respect to the scaling 22 and d c 2 k 0 d c 2 1 k 1 for any 0 1 s 1 proof as in the previous proof we will drop the subindex k and introduce it only if needed first of all let us analyze the homogeneity with respect to 22 of the determinant d detn det f f 1 f 2 s 1 from 25 we can rewrite it as d det f g 1 g 2 g 2 s 2 g 2 s 1 and since d g 2 d g 2 1 1 for all we have that d is homogeneous and d d 2 sn next denote by f jr the jth column of fr and let f j r i be the block column whose individual columns are equal to those of fr except for the ith column which is equal to the jth column of f 2 s for any r 0 1 2 s 1 10 define next d j 2 i det f f 1 f 2 1 f j 2 i f 2 1 f 2 s 1 we first notice that using 25 we can substitute the ith column of f j 2 i by the jth column of g 2 s since f 2 s and g 2 s differ in a linear combination of columns of f 2 r 1 r s let us call the new matrix f j g 2 i we then simplify the part of the determinant to the right of f j 2 i using 25 to become d j 2 i det f f 1 f 2 1 f j g 2 i g 2 1 f i 2 2 12 i g 2 g 2 s 2 g 2 s 1 f i 2 2 s 12 i where r 2 i denotes the ith row of r 2 we now proceed to simplify the columns f i 2 which can be substituted by g i 2 the ith column of g 2 since their difference is generated by odd vectors with subindiced less that 2 we can then simplify the rest of the determinant using 25 once more we get d j 2 i det f g 1 g 2 1 g j 2 i g 2 1 g i 2 2 12 i g 2 g 2 s 2 g 2 s 1 g i 2 2 s 12 i where g j 2 i indicates the matrix equal to g 2 except for the ith column which is equal to g j 2 s our last step is to notice that we have enough g 2 r block columns r 0 s 1 r 6 s that together with gj 2 i generically generate the entire subspace generated by g 2 r r 0 s 2 but the vector gi 2 belongs to this subspace and hence it will be a combination of the columns of those blocks thus d j 2 i det f g 1 g 2 1 g j 2 i g 2 1 g 2 g 2 s 2 g 2 s 1 which clearly shows that d j 2 i is homogeneous and since d g j 2 i 1 d d j 2 i 2 sn also finally t a is the solution of system of linear equations 30 and so by cramer s rule the j i entry of c 2 t a 2 is of the form d j 2 i d therefore c 2 is homogeneous and d c 2 0 0 s 1 we now study c 2 1 consider the determinant d j 2 1 i det f f 1 f 2 f j 2 1 i f 2 2 f 2 s 1 where f j 2 1 i is defined as f 2 1 substituting the ith column with the jth column of f 2 s as before using 25 we start by noticing that we can substitute the ith column of f j 2 1 i by the jth column of g 2 s call it g j 2 s plus f i 2 1 2 s 2 1 i j that comes from the expansion of f 2 s in terms of odd terms and the fact that the ith column of f 2 1 is missing the expression 2 s 2 1 i j is the i j entry of 2 s 2 1 we call the resulting matrix f j g 2 1 i if we simplify the right hand side of the determinant it becomes d j 2 1 i det f f 1 f 2 f j g 2 1 i g 2 2 f i 2 1 2 22 1 i g 2 3 g 2 s 2 f i 2 1 2 s 22 1 i g 2 s 1 2 s 2 1 i j det f f 1 f 2 f 2 1 g 2 2 g 2 s 1 det f f 1 f 2 g j 2 1 i g 2 2 f i 2 1 2 22 1 i g 2 3 g 2 s 2 f i 2 1 2 s 22 1 i g 2 s 1 where g j 2 1 i is equal to g 2 1 except for the ith column which is equal to g j 2 s 11 as before f i 2 1 and g i 2 1 differ in a sum of columns of f 2 r r thus we can substitute f i 2 1 by g i 2 1 in the determinant after that we proceed to simplify the rest of the determinant obtaining d j 2 1 i 2 s 2 1 i j d det f g 1 g 2 g j 2 1 i g 2 2 g i 2 1 2 22 1 i g 2 3 g 2 s 2 g i 2 1 2 s 22 1 i g 2 s 1 unlike the previous case this time one of the columns of g j 2 1 i is even and hence the odd columns other than g i 2 1 do not generate the odd orthogonal subspace since they are one dimension short thus including g i 2 1 we have an equal number of odd and even columns and we need to expand the term that includes no g i 2 1 in the expansion is given by det f g 1 g 2 g 2 g j 2 1 i g 2 2 g 2 s 2 g 2 s 1 0 since as we said before there are more even columns that odd columns the remain ing terms in the expansion are s 1 r 1 n p 1 2 r 2 1 i p det f g 1 g j 2 1 i g 2 r 1 g i 2 r g i 2 1 e t p g 2 r 1 g 2 s 2 g 2 s 1 where 2 r 2 1 i p is the i p entry of 2 r 2 1 g i 2 r has zero ith column and where ep is the standard canonical basis of rn with a 1 in the pth entry and zero elsewhere each one of these determinants has an equal number of odd and even columns each column is homogeneous of degree 1 and so each determinant is homogeneous of degree 2 sn but like d also of degree 2 sn they are multiplied by 2 r 2 1 i p homogeneous of degree 1 hence d j 2 1 i is homogeneous and d d j 2 1 i 2 sn 1 finally since according to 30 the j i entry of t a 2 1 c 2 1 is equal to d j 2 1 i d we conclude that c 2 1 is homogeneous and d c 2 1 1 this concludes the proof of the theorem our final step is to introduce the normalization matrices k and to study how they might affect the scaling degree of t aik recall that k has two factors dk used to normalize c 0 k and to transform them into their jordan form as in 6 and qk in the generic case a diagonal matrix used to define syzygies among the entries of cm 1 k as in 10 cm 1 k plays the role of b m 1 k in 10 lemma 6 the matrices k are homogeneous with respect to 22 and d k 1 for all k proof since k dkqk we will look at each factor separately the first factor dk is determined by the normalization of bk as in 9 where in our case bk m c 0 k as in 7 but given that c 0 k are invariant under the scaling bk will also be and hence so will dk the second factor qk is found by using a number of equations of the form 11 12 which finds each entry of qk as fuctions of the first entry q 1 k since c m 1 k which plays the role of bm 1 r is homogeneous with respect to the scaling equations 11 12 imply that qik are homogeneous also with equal degree also since det qk det d 1 k k where k det k each entry of qk will have degree equal to d k n hence to prove the lemma we need to show that d k n 12 but this follows from the fact that nk k 1 k t k where k is as in 19 must have determinant equals 1 since k does therefore det nk k k 1 k m 1 1 if we now apply the scaling and having in mind that d nk nm we get nm det nk k k 1 k m 1 1 where k 1 is the scaled determinant as show in 6 this system has a unique solution whenever n and m are coprime but k r k n for all k is clearly a solution hence n are homogeneous and d k n this concludes the proof we are now in position to prove our main theorem theorem 7 the grassmannian pentagram map on the moduli space pn defined by 21 is invariant under the scaling 22 proof we need to show that t aik are homogeneous and d t a 2 k 0 d t a 2 1 k 1 for 0 s 1 as in previous proofs we will drop the subindex unless there could be some confusion using 21 and denoting by a the last column of q we can write t a as t a 1 n 1 qt n on on m 1 or as the solution of the linear system of equations n t a qt n on on m 1 since we plan to use cramer s rule once more we will study the associated determi nants to start with we know that det n is a homogeneous function of degree nm nm 0 define d j r i det f f 1 1 fr 1 r 1 f j r i fr 1 r 1 f 2 s 1 2 s 1 det f f 1 fr 1 f j r i fr 1 f 2 s 1 1 r 1 r 1 2 s 1 where f j r i has all the columns equal to fr r except for the ith column which is given by the jth column of f 2 s 2 s that is by f 2 s j 2 s f 2 sd 2 sq j 2 sej with d 2 s and q 2 s as in 9 and 10 assume r 2 as in the first lemma we can use 25 to write down the determinants in terms of homogeneous components for example the jth column coming from f 2 s can be replaced by that of g 2 s in f j r i and we can simplify the terms to the left of it including the remaining columns of f 2 we obtain det f f 1 f 2 1 f j 2 i f 2 1 f 2 s 1 det f f 1 f 2 1 g j 2 i g 2 1 f i 2 2 1 2 i g 2 2 g 2 s 1 f i 2 2 s 1 2 i 13 the block column g j 2 i is equal to g 2 2 except for the ith column which is equal to g 2 s j 2 s we can further use 25 to substitute f i 2 with g i 2 once we do that we see that the even orthogonal subspace is generated by the columns of g 2 r r 0 s 1 except for the extra column in g 2 which in this case is generically covered by combination of columns in g 2 s j 2 s thus as before we can remove the g i 2 terms from the determinant and simplify to the left of the 2 position we obtain d j r i det f g 1 g 2 g 2 1 g j 2 i g 2 1 g 2 s 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 s 1 with hats and non hats alternating all of the columns of gr are homogeneous of degree 1 for any r on the other hand the columns of g j 2 i have degree zero since g 2 has degree 1 and 2 has degree 1 so does g 2 s j 2 s g 2 sd 2 sq j 2 sej therefore d d j r i n m 1 n m 1 0 the j i entry of t a 2 is given by d j 2 i d and hence d t a 2 0 assume r 2 1 in this case and always using 25 the determinant d j r i det f f 1 1 f 2 2 f j 2 1 i f 2 2 2 2 f 2 s 1 2 s 1 can be further simplified replacing the ith column of f j 2 1 i given by f 2 s j 2 s by h j 2 s g 2 s j 2 s f 2 1 2 s 2 1 j 2 s we can then simplify the side of the determinant to the right of f j 2 1 i so that f 2 r 1 g 2 r 1 and f 2 r g 2 r f i 2 1 2 r 2 1 i after this simplification we can also substitute f i 2 1 with g i 2 1 and f j 2 1 i by g j 2 1 i where all columns of g j 2 1 i are equal to those of g 2 1 2 1 except for the ith column given by g j 2 s g 2 s j 2 s g 2 1 2 s 2 1 j 2 s we then continue to simplify the part of the determinant to the left of g j 2 1 i the result of all these simplifications is the determinant det f g 1 g 2 g 2 g j 2 1 i g 2 2 g i 2 1 2 22 1 i g 2 3 g 2 s 2 g i 2 1 2 s 22 1 i g 2 s 1 first of all notice that if we expand this determinant the term in the expansion without any gi 2 1 is given by det f g 1 g 2 x g 2 2 g 2 s 1 where x equals g 2 1 2 1 except for the ith column given by g 2 1 2 s 2 1 j 2 s all columns of g 2 1 2 1 have degree zero except for the ith column which has degree 1 d g 2 1 d 2 s 2 1 1 while d j 2 s 1 therefore the degree of this determinant is n m 1 1 if we now look at any of the terms in the expansion containing gi 2 1 we have s 1 r 1 n p 1 2 r 2 1 i p det f g 1 y g 2 r 1 g i 2 r g i 2 1 e t p g 2 r 1 g 2 s 2 g 2 s 1 where 2 r 2 1 i p is the i p entry of 2 r 2 1 g i 2 r has zero ith column and where ep is the standard canonical basis of rn the matrix y is equal to g 2 1 2 1 except for the ith column which is equal to g j 2 s we can further simplify g j 2 s to become g 2 s j 2 s since its odd term is generated by the other columns 14 each column has degree 1 except for those in y which have degree 0 since each term is multiplied by 2 r 2 1 i p of degree 1 each term has degree n m 1 1 and so does the determinant from here d d j 2 1 i n m 1 1 n m 1 1 since the j i entry of t a 2 1 is given by d j 2 1 i d we have d t a 2 1 1 which concludes the proof of the theorem this theorem allows us to define the lax representation for the map t on pn indeed if we define qk on on on a 0 k in on on a 1 k on in on a 2 k on on in a 2 s 1 k then there is a unique matrix nk such that t qk nk 1 1 k qk nnk 31 the matrix nk which is invariant and hence depends on a r k is simply the matrix nk in 18 rescaled by 22 that is nk rk qk rk 1 qk qk 1 rk 2 qk qk 2 s 2 rk 2 s 1 we can ignore the factor in front the system of equations t k knk k 1 kqk has 31 as compatibility condition equation 31 must be independent from since t is defined by its last column and it is preserved by the scaling while the rest of the entries are zero or in and hence independent from hence this system is a standard lax representation for the pentagram map on grassmannian which can be used as usual to generate invariants of the map indeed the conjugation class of the monodromy is preserved by the map t pn pn as we saw before since a representative of the class is given by m q 0 q 1 qn 1 we obtain the following theorem theorem 8 the map t pn pn lies on the riemann surface det q 0 q 1 qn 1 inm 0 with c 5 pentagram map on gr n 2 s 1 n 5 1 definition of the map in this section we will define the pentagram map for the grassmannian gr n 2 s 1 n for s 1 recall that the dimension of gr n 2 s 1 n is 2 sn 2 assume that lk is a twisted polygon on gr n 2 s 1 n and let xk be any twisted lift let k be the unique n s 1 linear subspace containing the following subspaces k xk xk 2 xk 2 s 15 we define the pentagram map to be the map t taking the polygon to the unique twisted polygon with the same monodromy whose kth vertex has a lift given by the intersections k k 1 this map can be defined either on the space of polygons or on the vertices the map t is well defined and independent from the lift x in fact from the grassmann formula we get 2 s 1 n dim k 1 k dim k 1 dim k dim k 1 k s 1 n s 1 n dim k 1 k 2 s 1 n dim k 1 k which shows that dim k 1 k n for any k and hence k k 1 is a lift of a unique element in gr n 2 s 1 n an element equals to the kth vertex of t as before we will abuse notation and use t equally for the map on polygons on their lifts on frames or on the moduli space clearly the pentagram map is invariant under the action of the projective group linear on lifts and therefore one is able to write it as a map on the moduli space of grassmannian polygons as represented by the invariants we found in section 3 this is what we do next let us consider a twisted normalized lift v vk of a regular n gon lk as in theorem 1 then using dimension counting there exist 2 s 1 squared n n matrices a 0 k a 1 k a 2 s 1 k a 2 s k such that vk 2 s 1 vka 0 k vk 1 a 1 k vk 2 s 1 a 2 s 1 k vk 2 sa 2 s k 32 the blocks will be normalized so that a 0 k is diagonal or toeplitz and the entries of a 2 sk have a number of syzygies that relate them if the lift is twisted then aik will be n periodic for i 0 1 2 2 s that is aik n a i k 33 for any k since t vk k 1 we can assume that there exists cik n n matrices such that t vk vk 1 c 1 k vk 3 c 3 k vk 2 s 1 c 2 s 1 k vk 2 s 1 c 2 s 1 k 34 for all k z on other hand we can replace vk 2 s 1 in the last term of 34 by vk 2 s 1 vka 0 k vk 1 a 1 k vk 2 s 1 a 2 s 1 k vk 2 sa 2 s k 35 it follows that t vk vk 1 c 1 k vk 3 c 3 k vk 2 s 1 c 2 s 1 k vka 0 k vk 1 a 1 k vk 2 s 1 a 2 s 1 k vk 2 sa 2 s k c 2 s 1 k 36 vka 0 kc 2 s 1 k vk 1 c 1 k a 1 kc 2 s 1 k vk 2 a 2 kc 2 s 1 k vk 3 c 3 k a 3 kc 2 s 1 k vk 2 s 2 a 2 s 2 k c 2 s 1 k vk 2 s 1 c 2 s 1 k a 2 s 1 k c 2 s 1 k vk 2 sa 2 s k c 2 s 1 k since we also have t vk k it follows that c 2 1 k a 2 1 k c 2 s 1 k for any 0 s 1 and t vk vka 0 k vk 2 a 2 k vk 2 s 2 a 2 s 2 k vk 2 sa 2 s k c 2 s 1 k remark 9 as in the previous case the matrix invariant matrix c 2 s 1 k has no ap parent restrictions but in fact it is completely determined in order to be able to define the pentagram map on the moduli space coordinates given by the matrices a j k we need to guarantee that t vk nk 1 is the lift of t lk as described by theorem 1 as far as t is generic as we showed in theorem 1 there is such a unique lift and c 2 s 1 k k will be the proportional matrix that appears in the theorem in fact we have not shown that if is regular so is t as it was the case with the original pentagram map 10 the map is only generically defined 16 example 2 for s 1 that is on gr n 3 n the pentagram map is t vk vka 0 k vk 2 a 2 k k vk vk 1 vk 2 a 0 kon a 2 k k krk k for any k z now define k vk vk 1 vk 2 s 1 vk 2 s 37 so that for any k z t vk k a 0 k on a 2 k on on a 2 sk k as before if k 1 kqk and rk a 0 k on a 2 k a 2 s 2 k on a 2 sk and if we extend t to k by applying it to each block column we can write t k k rk k rk 1 rk 1 k 1 rk 2 rk 2 k 2 rk 2 srk 2 s k 2 s 38 where if qk is given as in 3 then rk i qkqk 1 qk i 1 for i 1 2 now as we did before for any k z define nk rk rk 1 rk 1 rk 2 rk 2 rk 2 srk 2 s it follows that t k knk k k 1 kqk 39 where k k on on on k 1 on on on k 2 s as before the compatibility condition of these two natural maps is given by t t k t knk k 1 nk 1 t t k t k 1 t kqk t k t qk hence k 1 nk 1 k 1 t k t qk knk kt qk for all k z it shows that 39 together with t qk n 1 k 1 k qknk 1 k 1 40 holds true for any k z and describes a discrete parameter free lax representation for the map t defined on the moduli space as represented by the invariants that appear in the last column of qk notice that from 38 we now that k are also periodic that is k n k for any k and from the definition in 3 so are both qk and rk 17 5 2 a lax representation for the pentagram map on gr n 2 s 1 n as we did for the even dimensional case in this section we will prove that one can introduce a parameter in 39 in such a way that 40 will be independent from this will define a true lax representation that can be used for integration of the map as it was done in 6 we will prove that the map t is invariant under a scaling this time given by a 2 r 1 k 1 r sa 2 r 1 k r 0 s 1 a 2 r k r sa 2 rk r 0 1 s 41 we will follow the same steps as in the even dimensional case the first steps involve proving that the map defined without the proportional matrix k is invariant under the scaling we will then calculate the degree of k using these results and incorporate the proportional matrices k to the map to finally calculate the degree of t a i k first of all notice that if as before we denote by fk r the r 1 block column of nk the analogous to lemma 4 still holds true we cite it here without proof since the proof is identical lemma 10 let fk rk and fk rk rk 1 as above then there exist n n matrices ji such that fk 2 r 1 fk 2 r 1 2 2 r 1 gk 2 fk 2 1 r 0 fk 2 r 2 1 2 r g k 2 1 42 for 1 where g k 2 1 pk t gk 2 2 s t gk 2 2 1 2 r t 2 2 r 1 2 1 0 t gk 2 2 s 43 with pk on a 1 k on a 3 k on a 2 s 1 k on 44 and gk 2 2 t g k 2 1 2 22 r 1 t 2 1 2 r gk fk rk 45 by a 2 s we mean the last n n block entry of a matrix a the main difference with the even dimensional case is that the even block columns g 2 start now with a non zero block while before it started with a zero one and generate a s 1 n dimensional subspace orthogonal to those generated by the odd ones g 2 1 which start with a zero block and generate a sn dimensional subspace also in this case the first two blocks of g 2 are zero since gk 2 t g k 2 1 and shifts all the blocks once downwards assume first that we drop the k factor and define t vk krk define also cik t a i k which is given by the compatibility formula below the anal ogous to 29 t qk n 1 k qknk 1 then t ak n 1 k qkt fk 2 s n 1 k fk 2 s 1 18 which can be written as nkt ak fk 2 s 1 46 once more t ak can be interpreted as the solution of the linear equation 46 theorem 11 the matrices cik are homogenous with respect to the scaling 41 and d c 2 k s d c 2 1 k 1 s notice that the degree of crk coincides with that of a r k later we will show that k are all invariant under scaling and this theorem will essentially prove the invariance of the map under 41 let us once more drop the subindex k unless needed as we did in the previous case we will work with determinants of the form d j r i simplifing them down to their homogeneous component and calculating their degree because they are solution of 46 each entry of cr will be a quotient of these determinants and d and this way we will be able to determine their degree the study comes in a number of lemmas lemma 12 the determinant d det f f 1 f 2 s is invariant under 41 proof using 42 we have that d det f g 1 g 2 g 2 s 1 g 2 s this time all g 2 r t g 2 r 1 have the first two blocks equal on therefore the blocks in the first row of d are all zero except for the first block which is the first block of f r i e a 0 and which is invariant under scaling if we simplify using the first n rows we have the determinant of a matrix that looks like a 1 1 on a 1 2 on a 1 s on on b 1 1 on b 1 2 on b 1 s a 2 1 on a 2 2 on a 2 s on on b 2 1 on b 2 2 on b 2 s as 1 on as 2 on as s on on bs 1 on bs 2 on bs s where ai j are the nonzero blocks of g 2 j 1 and bi j are the nonzero blocks of g 2 j using n 2 s s 1 exchanges of rows and columns this determinant can be easily transformed into det a osn osn b with a ai j and b bi j also since g 2 t g 2 1 we have that b t a and d detadet t a we will next show that d ai j i j s this will imply from the definition of determinant that d deta n s i 1 s j 1 i j s 0 concluding the proof indeed from 43 we have g 2 1 p t g 2 2 s t g 2 p t 2 g 2 1 2 s 1 2 t 2 g 2 1 and using this we conclude that ak 1 a 2 k 1 t as t 2 ak 1 47 19 the degrees of the nonzero blocks of p are given by 1 1 1 s 1 2 s 1 s 1 s while the degree of a 2 s is 1 thus d ak 1 d a 2 k 1 a 2 s d t a 2 k 2 k 1 s we now use induction assume that d ai j i j s for all i 1 s and all j from 47 we have that since d a 2 k 1 1 k 1 s d a 2 k 1 t 2 as 1 k 1 s s s k 1 s d t 2 ak 1 k 1 s and so d ak 1 k 1 s concluding the proof of the lemma let us denote by d j r i the determinant given by d j r i det f f 1 fr 1 f j r i fr 1 f 2 s where f j r i is the block column obtained from fr by substituting the ith column f i r with the jth column of f 2 s 1 f j 2 s 1 lemma 13 determinant d j 2 1 i is homogeneous for all i j 1 n and 0 s 1 and d d j 2 1 i 1 s proof as in the previous cases we will make heavy use of 42 to reduce the determi nants to their homogeneous components before calculating their degree first of all we will substitute the ith column of f j 2 1 i in det f f 1 f 2 f j 2 1 i f 2 2 f 2 s by that of g 2 s 1 g j 2 s 1 since the difference is a combination of even columns which are all present in the determinant we can then simplify the columns to the right of this and substitute them by either g 2 r 1 or by g 2 r g i 2 1 2 r 2 1 i where a super index indicate the column a subindex the row we can then substitute all the remaining columns of f j 2 1 i and fr r 2 by those of gr or g r depending on parity to obtain d j r i det f g 1 g 2 g j 2 1 i g 2 2 g i 2 1 2 22 1 i g 2 3 g 2 s g i 2 1 2 s 2 1 i where g j 2 1 i is equal to g 2 1 except for its ith column which has been substituted by the jth column of g 2 s 1 since the missing column in g 2 1 has been substituted by another odd column if we expand this determinant all the terms that include any extra column g i 2 1 will vanish since we already have odd columns equal to half the dimension in their standard position therefore d j r i det f g 1 g 2 g j 2 1 i g 2 2 g 2 3 g 2 s consider now the following product g j 2 s 1 g i 2 1 g i 2 1 1 g j 2 s 1 48 20 where by g i 2 1 1 we mean the vector whose entries are the inverses of the entries of g i 2 1 and where the product represents the individual entries product as customary we claim that g i 2 1 1 g j 2 s 1 is homogeneous each entry with the same degree indeed using the fact that d ai j i j s recall that ai j i 1 s are the nonzero blocks of g 2 j 1 j 1 s we can see that d g i 2 1 1 g j 2 s 1 d g j 2 s 1 d g i 2 1 1 1 1 s 1 s 1 s s 1 s s 1 s 1 s 1 s 1 s where indicates the position of a zero block therefore substituting g j 2 s 1 by 48 in the determinant expanding the determinant using this column and using the fact that d is invariant under scaling gives us d d j 2 1 i 1 s as claimed lemma 14 determinant d j 2 i is also homogeneous for all i j 1 n 0 s 1 and d d j 2 i s proof the proof of this case is a bit more complicated we need to look at the determinant d j 2 i det f f 1 f 2 1 f j 2 i f 2 1 f 2 s as before we simplify the ith column of f j 2 i using 42 that is f j 2 s 1 will be substituted by g j 2 s 1 f i 2 2 s 12 i j 49 we can then substitute the columns to the right of this one we substitute f 2 r 1 by g 2 r 1 f i 2 2 r 12 i and f 2 r by g 2 r we can also substitute f i 2 in the expression of f 2 r 1 by g i 2 we then change the remaining columns in f j 2 i including f i 2 by those of g 2 we call the resulting matrix g j 2 i and substitute the f s blocks to the left of g j 2 i by g blocks then column 49 becomes g j 2 s 1 g i 2 2 s 12 i j 50 and the resulting determinant is given by det f g 1 g 2 g 2 1 g j 2 i g 2 1 g i 2 2 12 i g 2 2 g 2 s 1 g i 2 2 s 12 i g 2 s if we now expand the determinant using the ith column of g j 2 i i e 50 we have d j 2 i 2 s 12 i j d det f g 1 g 2 g 2 1 g j 2 i g 2 1 g i 2 2 12 i g 2 2 g 2 s 1 g i 2 2 s 12 i g 2 s where g j 2 i has as ith column g j 2 s 1 and g 2 elsewhere notice that once more if we expand this determinant the terms with no gi 2 will be zero since we have more odd columns that are needed to generate the odd subspace 21 indicated with a hat given that g j 2 i contains one thus the determinant expands as s 1 r 1 n p 1 2 r 12 i p det f g 1 g 2 g j 2 i g 2 1 g p 2 r 1 g i 2 e t p g 2 1 g 2 s where g p 2 r 1 indicates g 2 r 1 with a zero p column each one of these terms can transformed by shifting the p column of g p 2 r 1 g i 2 e t p and the ith column of g j 2 i the expansion becomes s 1 r 1 n p 1 2 r 12 i p det f g 1 g 2 g 2 g 2 1 g p 2 r 1 g j 2 s 1 e t p g 2 1 g 2 s 51 and now we are ready to calculate degrees substitute g j 2 s 1 by g j 2 s 1 g j 2 s 1 g p 2 r 1 1 g p 2 r 1 as before and notice that the degree of g j 2 s 1 g p 2 r 1 1 is the same for all of its block entries and equal to 1 r s d g j 2 s 1 g p 2 r 1 1 d g j 2 s 1 d g p 2 r 1 1 s 1 s 2 s 1 s s s 1 s 1 r 1 s 2 r 1 s s r 1 s we now need to calculate the degree of j i this is simple from 43 and 45 we see that d 2 r 10 s r s d 2 r 12 d 2 r 1 0 1 r s d 2 r 2 1 d 2 r 1 1 0 1 r 1 s with this every term in the expansion 51 has degree 1 r s d 2 r 12 i p 1 r s 1 r s s and since d 2 s 12 i j d d 2 s 12 i j 1 s s s we conclude the proof of the lemma after these results the proof of theorem 11 is immediate since the entry j i of cr is the quotient d j r i d and so d cr d d j r i which coincide with the statement of the theorem finally the following theorem is a consequence of 11 theorem 15 if n and m are coprime the map t is invariant under the scaling 41 22 proof to prove this result we simply need to prove that k are invariant under scaling after this fact is proved computations similar to those in the proof of theorem 7 will show that even as we introduce k in the different block columns of determinants d and d j i they do alter neither the homogeneity nor the degree of the determinants because they are invariant under the scaling and all columns of a block column have the same degree and so do their linear combinations therefore d crk d t a r k d a r k for any k and r 0 m 1 we will avoid further details of those computations since they are almost identical to those in 7 and the interested reader can reproduce them to show that k are invariant under scaling is not hard if n and m are coprime their determinants k det k are the unique solution of detnk k k 1 k m 1 1 and since detnk dk detnk is invariant under the scaling since d dk 0 and so are k for any k we next look at each factor in the splitting of k dkqk as in the previous case the factors dk are determined by the normalization of bk m c 0 k as in 7 and since c 0 k are invariant under the scaling so will dk finally qk are uniquely determined by equations of the form 11 and 12 for cm 1 k and by their determinants since c k i j c m 1 k m 1 c m 1 k m 1 c m 1 n k m is homo geneous equations 11 12 are scaling invariant furthermore det qk det d 1 k k and both k and det dk are scaling invariant so is det qk therefore qk are scaling invariant and so are k as in the even dimensional case this theorem allows us to define the lax repre sentation for the map t pn pn indeed if we define qk on on on on on a 0 k in on on on on 1 a 1 k on in on on on 1 s a 2 k on on in on on 1 1 s a 3 k on on on in on 1 s 1 s a 2 s 1 k on on on on in a 2 s k then we can define nk rk rk rk 1 rk 1 rk 2 rk m 2 rk m 1 where rk a 0 r on 1 s a 2 r on 2 s a 4 r on ask and rk r qk qk 1 qk r the compatibility condition of the system k 1 kqk t k knk will be given by t qk nk 1 1 k qk nnk 52 23 equation 52 must be independent from since t is defined by its last column and it is preserved by the scaling while the rest of the entries are zero or in and hence independent from hence this system is a standard lax representation for the pentagram map on grassmannian in the case m 2 s 1 which can also be used as usual to generate invariants of the map with this new scaling theorem 8 is also true in the case when m is odd acknowledgements this paper is supported by mar beffa s nsf grant dms 1405722 by felipe s conacyt grant 222870 and by the hospitality of the uni versity of
