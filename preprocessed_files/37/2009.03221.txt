analysis and simulation of a novel run and tumble model with autochemotaxis nicholas j russell and louis f rossi february 3 2021 abstract we model analyze and simulate a novel run and tumble model with autochemotaxis bi ologically inspired by the phytoplankton heterosigma akashiwo developing a fundamental understanding of planktonic movements and interactions through phototaxis and chemotaxis is vital to comprehending why harmful algal blooms habs start to form and how they can be prevented we develop a one and two dimensional mathematical and computational model reflecting the movement of an ecology of plankton incorporating both run and tumble motion and autochemotaxis we present a succession of complex and biologically meaningful models combined with a sequence of laboratory and computational experiments that inform the ideas underlying the model by analyzing the dynamics and pattern formation which are similar to experimental observations we identify parameters that are significant in plankton s pattern formation in the absence of bulk fluid flow we find that the precise form of chemical deposition and plankton sensitivity to small chemical gradients are crucial parameters that drive nonlinear pattern formation in the plankton density 1 introduction plankton is a general term for a wide range of floating or drifting organisms in fresh and salt water they are not strong enough to swim against currents plankton are of considerable scientific inter est for a number of reasons for one they are an important food source for larger organisms also they process about 60 of the marine carbon and they consume a significant fraction of man made co 2 while producing about half of the atmospheric oxygen berdalet et al 2016 riebesell 2008 nonetheless plankton exhibit a rich array of behaviors including self propulsion aggregation pho tosynthesis feeding and predation sheng et al 2007 2010 sometimes coordinated microscopic behaviors lead to significant mesoscale processes most notably several types of plankton are re sponsible for harmful algal blooms habs wherein the population density of plankton skyrockets in a concentrated area hallegraeff et al 2004 however some types of plankton and particularly those involved in the formation of habs aggregate even when there is no external current while it is reasonable to model plankton as independent passive scalar quantities drifting in a flow field a more detailed understanding of their behavior may help scientists understand and anticipate when plankton will aggregate and what combinations of features will drive this process in this paper we seek to construct analyze and simulate a run and tumble model with au tochemotaxis this work is biologically inspired by the dynamics of the phytoplankton heterosigma akashiwo over the past several years this raphidophyte has caused several habs throughout the world including japan scandanavia south carolina and the delaware bay hennige et al 2013 1 ar x iv 2 00 9 03 22 1 v 2 m at h d s 3 f eb 2 02 1 these habs are responsible for large fish kills e g the puget sound in 2006 and public health hazards for the communities that surround the coasts lewitus et al 2012 this is of particular in terest to the delaware community as these habs are becoming more frequent over the past several years in the delaware bay heterosigma akashiwo are predatory swimmers capable of consuming bacteria and performing an inefficient photosynthesis even in the absence of prey or bulk fluid motion plankton exhibit complex pattern formations in two and three dimensions their behavior is a direct response of local chemical turbulent and optical cues so a fundamental understanding of how they swim and hunt is essential to anticipating changes in marine ecology in response to climate change and ocean acidification fu et al 2012 sengupta et al 2017 we discuss a research program at the university of delaware to mathematically model analyze and understand complex plankton behavior these activities include careful experiments isolating specific variables and behaviors to connect them to a unique coupling of well established processes in predation chemotaxis and phototaxis we develop and analyze a model for plankton motion and signaling that is built upon the works of several authors hillen 2002 hillen and painter 2009 keller and segel 1971 a b lushi et al 2012 bearon and pedley 2000 in order to gain insight and understanding into the interacting mechanisms of organism propulsion and chemical deposition diffusion and decay the motion of plankton is driven by a number of processes only some of which have been fully explored experimentally for our model organism heterosigma akashiwo therefore it is necessary to limit the study of their motion to a subset of these which have the greatest impact on their bulk coordinated behavior in this paper we will limit our discussion to run and tumble propulsive behavior which has been studied extensively keller and segel 1971 a b when combined with autochemotaxis in which organisms release the chemical they are attracted to run and tumble motion admits quite rich dynamics which mirror experimental findings we develop and analyze a one and two dimensional model of plankton motion incorporating run and tumble motion along with autochemotaxis while using a biologically relevant tumbling probability we acknowledge that past studies have suggested that gravity and rotational diffusion can describe the movement of heterosigma akashiwo in three dimensions e g bearon and gru nbaum 2008 however gravity and rotational diffusion are negligible in two dimensions and movement can be described well by run and tumble motion visser 2008 shaw and stastna 2017 in section 2 we summarize the experiments conducted and the resultant observations which inform our mathematical model in section 3 we develop analytical models of run and tumble dynamics coupled with autochemotaxis in one and two dimensions in section 4 an analysis of the one dimensional model is conducted both analytically and numerically in section 5 we analyze our two dimensional model analytically and numerically in section 6 we discuss the analysis and simulations by connecting our results to experimental observations finally in section 7 we share our conclusions of this work and future research opportunities 2 some experimental insights into plankton aggregation in this paper we use heterosigma akashiwo a constituent plankton in an algal bloom colloquially referred to as the red tide as our model organism to gain insight on the evolution and dynamics of the plankton distributions we performed a series of laboratory experiments using a camera to gather raw data see appendix a for the full details on experimentation the data should be considered qualitative in the sense that we could not rigorously map the image density to a 2 a deep plate experiment b shallow plate experiment figure 1 pictures from various experiments conducted the aggregations in b formed after 5 minutes in complete darkness an infrared camera was used calibrated population density we anticipate that two main mechanisms drive the plankton density distribution in water without external fluid flow chemotaxis and phototaxis for chemotaxis plankton swim in response to a chemical while also emitting the chemical also called autochemotaxis seymour et al 2009 phototaxis is dependent on the plankton s photosystem behavior and the depth of the water and light is a source of energy for the organism its photosystem is degraded by light and is constantly repaired by internal biochemical reactions fu et al 2008 as well plankton are observed to vertically and horizontally migrate towards and away from light and it is reasonable to hypothesize that the state of their photosystem drives this behavior hara and chihara 1987 lastly recent studies have shown that plankton are able to change their migration strategies due to microscopic turbulent cues and thus we should not model them as passive scalars in a fluid flow sengupta et al 2017 it is our aim to investigate autochemotactic behavior in this model organism as a foundation for exploring its richer behavior in response to phototaxis and other processes impacting migration and aggregation to demonstrate the richness of the full dynamics of heterosigma akashiwo even in the absence of an external driving fluid flow we conducted experiments in a deep tank in this deep tank all effects from chemotaxis and phototaxis are observable we observe plankton aggregating into complex patches and filaments while migrating towards and away from the light see fig 1 a water attenuates light captured by the lambert beer law and aggregations can shade other plankton to remove optical attenuation and shading from consideration and to minimize the impact 3 a time elapsed 2 minutes b time elapsed 6 minutes c time elapsed 15 minutes d time elapsed 40 minutes e time elapsed 60 minutes figure 2 the evolution of aggregation patterns from heterosigma akashiwo during an hour long experiment we used a square shallow dish with a length of 6 3 cm along with a lamp placed at a 60 angle of incidence we used a filter on each picture to make the aggregations clearer we note that the spiral pattern in a is caused by initial fluid motion when the plankton solution is poured into the dish initially 4 of vertical migration the depth of the water column is reduced until the vertical effects were no longer observable which occurs when the depth is less than 1 cm all experiments we discuss from now on only consider a shallow dish to remove vertical migration from consideration as a dominant affect the system is flooded with light and thus there is no photo intensity gradient in the field therefore the shallow environment allows us to eliminate certain affects attributable to the organisms sensitivity to light we still must account for the fact that heterosigma akashiwo responds to light even if light is uniformly distributed in the shallow environment to further isolate the behavioral impact of photosynthesis we conduct an experiment where we film heterosigma akashiwo in complete darkness allowing the photosystems in all organisms to reset and then observe what occurs once light returns within the first 10 minutes aggregations form in complete darkness see fig 1 b thus we can establish that autochemotaxis drives the formation of aggregations conducting experiments with lights on we observe that phototaxis drives the coarsening and movement of these aggregations from a simple experiment shown in fig 2 aggregations started forming within 2 minutes more rapidly than the time it takes the photosystems to degrade and break the structure of the aggregations is also different with and without light so phototaxis changes the dynamics of aggregation shapes we conducted experiments with a lid flush with the upper liquid surface to see if marangoni effects were playing a role in the formation of aggregations and found no observed difference with all other free surface experiments from these experiments and observations we infer that although phototaxis stimulates motion and perhaps aggregation chemotaxis combined with run and tumble is the initial driver of aggregations of heterosigma akashiwo 3 a 1 d and 2 d model of plankton motion 3 1 the two dimensional model consider a system of np plankton as point sources x t np i 1 x xi t 1 where xi t x 1 t x 2 t is the position of the ith plankton and x is the dirac delta function we denote c x t as the chemical concentration at a point x when considering a classic run and tumble model for plankton motion literature recommends the flipping probability of p tumble in t t t 0 2 1 v c v c t 2 where v is the velocity of a plankton 0 0 and c is the chemical gradient saintillan 2018 this model is problematic from a biological perspective we see that v c v c sgn v c takes three distinct values 1 0 and 1 this gives a drastic shift in behavior when plankton flips to being orthogonal to the gradient implying an infinite sensitivity to both the environment and the organism s response to the chemical thus we propose to create a transition to smooth out this hard shift by using the parameter 0 and converting 2 into p tumble in t t t 0 2 1 v c v c 2 2 t 3 5 biologically captures the ability of an organism to sense weak gradients in its environment as 0 the organism can perfectly sense an infinitesimally small gradient and we recover our original model 2 larger values of describe a smooth transition in the organism s behavior which could capture a noisier response to weak signals when averaged over multiple instances of the same organism or multiple organisms in close proximity we shall see later that has a strong impact on macroscopic pattern formation we assume the plankton move in a run and tumble motion with chemotaxis i e the probability of a plankton tumbling and changing directions is given by 3 if a plankton does tumble the probability that a plankton moves from a direction v to v is defined by the transition probability t v v we assume that plankton move at a constant speed v and thus v v e where e cos sin because of this assumption the transition probability can be rewritten as t v v t the chemical attractant which is produced by each plankton diffuses and decays throughout the system since there is no consensus on when the plankton emit this chemical we will assume that plankton emit this chemical based on how much chemical they can sense at their current position let f c be a general deposition function that is only dependent on the chemical c the diffusion and decay of c can be captured in an evolution equation for the chemical attractant 4 ct c c f c where 0 is the diffusion coefficient and 0 is the decay coefficient in order develop a model for from an eulerian perspective we now define x t to be the density of the plankton at a given time and location in r 2 we introduce x t as the density of plankton at time t and position x moving in the direction thus the evolution equation for can be written as a fokker plank equation 5 x t 2 0 x t d 6 t v e 0 2 1 v c e v 2 c e 2 2 0 2 2 0 1 v c e v 2 c e 2 2 t x t d in 6 the first term represents plankton that have moved away from position x the second term represents the plankton at x who tumbled to a different direction than and the third term represents the plankton that have tumbled at x to the direction of from therefore 4 6 is the continuum two dimensional run and tumble with autochemotaxis system to non dimensionalize this model we denote the natural time scale of 1 0 and the natural length scale of l v 0 define the non dimensional time and length as t t x l x where the notation denotes a non dimensional parameter to simplify further we assume that the turning kernel is a uniform distribution i e t 1 2 removing the star notation we obtain the following 6 non dimensional model of autochemotactic driven motion in 2 d 7 a ct d 1 c d 2 c f c 7 b x t 2 0 x t d 7 c t e 1 2 1 c e c e 2 2 1 4 2 0 1 c e c e

the near limitless domain in which plankton truly live computational limitations necessarily require that we make finite 3 2 the 1 d model for a one dimensional model is limited to values of 0 right moving and left moving and and c vary with x r and t 0 only we can remove the dependence entirely by replacing x t with the distinct functions x t and x t representing right and left moving plankton respectively equation 3 can be rewritten as p tumble in t t t 0 2 1 cx c 2 x 2 8 and we assume that the plankton move at a constant speed v for the autochemotaxis part of the model let f c denote an arbitrary deposition function we can then write the evolution equations as follows 9 a ct cxx c f c 9 b t v x 0 2 1 cx c 2 x 2 0 2 1 cx c 2 x 2 9 c t v x 0 2 1 cx c 2 x 2 0 2 1 cx c 2 x 2 non dimensionalizing we denote the natural time scale of 1 0 and the natural length scale of l v 0 define the non dimensional time and length as t t and x lx where the notation denotes a non dimensional

switch deposition function and the orange dotted line is f 3 c the linear switch deposition functions the analytic descriptions of f 2 c and f 3 c can be found in equations 12 a and 12 b respectively where d 1 0 v 2 and d 2 0 and f c which is scaled by 1 0 are all non dimensional if we define x t to be the total density then manipulating 10 b and 10 c allows us to obtain a coupled pde system for

for heterosigma akashiwo is unknown we will utilize basic deposition functions related to other organisms such as insects and bacteria the three deposition functions we analyze are f 1 c f 2 c c 0 c and f 3 c c c 0 c where c 0 0 and x is the heaviside function the constant function f 1 is where an organism always emits the chemical the switch f 2 is where an organism releases the chemical only if the chemical concentration at x is below the threshold c 0 and the linear switch f 3 is where an organism releases a specific amount of chemical dependent on the amount of chemical at x but does not emit if the chemical at x is above c 0 in our numerical simulations we smooth out the heaviside functions to avoid discontinuities as 12 a f 2 c 2 tanh c 0 c t 0 1 12 b f 3 c c 0 2 c 0 2 c 0 tanh c 0

the 1 d system we analyze the stability of the constant steady states of 10 a 10 c there is a constant steady state from 10 a of d 2 c f c where 2 and is the constant solution for both and we linearize around this solution by letting c c b a a 13 where 1 and a a and b are functions in terms of time and space substituting 13 into 10 a 10 c at leading order of we obtain 14 a bt d 1 bxx d 3 b

let a a and b denote the transforms 9 of a a and b respectively letting k denote the wave number in the fourier transform we obtain 15 a b k 2 d 1 b d 3 b f c a a 15 b a ika 1 2 a a ik b 15 c a ika 1 2 a a ik b which can be rewritten into the matrix form ba a d 3 d 1 k 2 f c f c ik ik 1 2 1 2 ik 1 2 ik 1 2 ba a 16 we now look for eigenvalues of the 3 3 matrix in 16 denoting as an eigenvalue of the above matrix we can write the characteristic equation as 17 3 d 1 k 2 d 3 1 2 d 1 1 k 2 d 3 k 2 d 1 k 2 d 3 cd 2 0 we seek to find combinations of parameters in which the constant solution is unstable take the roots of 17 as the set 1 k 2 k 3 k and define r k max re i 3 i 1 let ku be the most unstable wave number i e ku arg max k 0 r k 18 if ku 2 the set of parameters will make c unstable in the domain length given a fixed set of parameters d 1 d 2 c and deposition function f c we can vary k to numerically find the most unstable wave number examples of the function r k are shown in fig 4 in fig 4 a we keep d 2 constant but vary the diffusion rate d 1 as d 1 increases ku decreases alternatively in fig 4 b d 1 is kept constant but the chemical decay rate d 2 is varied as d 2 increases ku increases to see this relationship between d 1 and d 2 more clearly we plot the stability regions for a domain length in the d 1 d 2 plane shown in figs 4 c and 4 d the green shaded regions are examples of parameter regimes where the system would be unstable when 6 for either 0 01 or 0 012 as increases incrementally the stable regime becomes much larger as well we note that the curve separating the unstable and stable regimes becomes linear as d 1 and d 2 both increase we now remark on some properties of 17 and r k the proofs of which can be found in appendices b 1 and b 2 respectively these two propositions give stability conditions for large wave numbers and when the constant solution c may admit an unstable solution proposition 1 if d 1 0 lim k r k 1 2 proposition 2 define d 3 f c d 2 then if cd 2 d 3 1 2 d 1 1 1 4 cd 1 d 2 19 there will be an such that the constant solution c to 10 a 10 c is unstable 10 a varying d 1 with d 2 1 b varying d 2 with d 1 1 c stability regions with 0 01 d stability regions with 0 012 figure 4 plots a and b display r k with varied d 1 and d 2 parameters plots c and d show phase space stability for a constant solution of 11 a 11 b with varied parameters used can be found in appendix c 2 4 2 linear growth and nonlinear saturation having analyzed regimes which admit unstable or stable constant solutions we now explore the long term dynamics of the model we computed the nonlinear solutions shown in this section using numerical simulations of our one dimensional model represented by 11 a 11 b with periodic boundary conditions the specific details of our algorithm and the parameters used are in appendix c and table 3 respectively in figure 5 and online resource 1 we observe the evolution of the system in a parameter regime where the constant stationary solution is unstable the unstable distribution of aggregations rapidly saturates from nonlinear interactions and yields a slowly evolving coarsening pattern eventually becoming a single aggregation the top two panels display the plankton density and chemical density c respectively the lower panel displays e k which shows the real part of the fourier 11 figure 5 time series of plots for simulation of 1 d autochemotactic system 11 a 11 b at t 0 4 20 150 the top row displays the evolution of plankton density the middle row display the evolution of chemical concentration c the bottom row shows the evolution of e k see 20 where k are the fourier modes the black vertical lines in the bottom row are at the most unstable wave number ku 8 this simulation can be seen in its entirely in online resource 1 and parameters used can be found in appendix c 2 modes of c i e e k t 0 re f c x t 0 k 20 where f is the fourier transform operator to calculate this numerically we utilize a fast fourier transform aside from the translational mode of k 0 the most unstable wave number ku will grow the quickest initially in this simulation the most unstable wave number is ku 8 denoted by the black dashed lines on the plots at t 4 six small aggregations are formed and the mode at k ku has been triggered as it is the most pronounced k at the outset at t 20 the aggregations have coarsened down to only 2 aggregations and ku has diminished from view due to this clustering the final panel at t 150 shows that the two aggregations have merged forming one large aggregation we emphasize the timescale difference between the coarsening from six to two aggregations and from two to one aggregations in figs 6 and 7 we explore two important facets of our model the deposition function and recall our three deposition functions defined in 12 a and 12 b for this comparison we choose parameter values for f 1 c f 2 c and f 3 c such that all systems are unstable and have the same ku 12 a simulation using f c f 1 c animation in online resource 1 b simulation using f c f 2 c animation in online resource 2 c simulation using f c f 3 c animation in online resource 3 d total chemical over time c t figure 6 time series of plots for simulation of 1 d autochemotactic system 11 a 11 b for various deposition functions all simulation parameters which can be found in appendix c 2 result in an unstable constant solution with ku 8 169 note that the scale for the chemical concentration is different in a the total chemical over time for all three simulations is in d 13 some key differences emerge from these simulations in figs 6 a 6 c even though all simulations have a similar number of aggregations from t 4 to t 20 ending up with two aggregations at t 20 the time needed to fully merge the final two aggregations varies the linear switch deposition function f 3 admits a singular aggregation at t 100 but it takes until t 350 for the switch deposition function f 2 to merge as well we see a clear difference in the profile for c achieved at the non constant steady state the f 1 function admits a profile for c and that are relatively similar but c and look vastly different for the f 2 and f 3 cases this can be attributed to the threshold parameter c 0 hampering the plankton s ability to deposit chemical once c becomes too large other insights can be gleaned from the total chemical concentration profile c t fig 6 d the total chemical for the f 1 simulation remains at its equilibrium value between merging events for the f 2 and f 3 simulations there is steady chemical total however several time steps prior to a merging event there is a drastic decrease in the amount of chemical due to the restructuring of we show that c t stays constant for f c f 1 c in a general two dimensional case in proposition 3 in section 5 this model is also highly sensitive to which expresses the ability of the organism to admit strong differentiated responses to small gradients in fig 7 the parameter is decreased to show the differences in the final steady state solution of the model as decreases the peak of the plankton density and chemical concentration become more sharp at 0 note that a steady state solution of 11 a 11 b must satisfy xx sgn cx x 0 21 with periodic boundary conditions due to the translational invariance of the solution to 21 we can center the aggregation in the middle of our domain 0 using fig 7 a we recognize that sgn cx 0 where 0 x 2 and sgn cx 0 where 2 x thus we obtain a steady state solution of stitched exponential functions x a 0 e x x 0 2 a 0 e x x 2 a 0 2 e 2 1 22 the stability of this steady state is still unknown along with the other non constant steady state solutions with 0 however through numerical experimentation we conjecture that this steady state is unconditionally stable 5 analysis of the 2 d auto chemotactic system 5 1 fourier stability analysis we now look for steady state solutions to the two dimensional system 7 a 7 c we find a trivial constant steady state of d 2 c f c and 2 similar to the one dimensional analysis we perturb this constant solution as c c 2 0 23 where are functions of time and space and 1 substituting the perturbations from 23 to 7 a we obtain the evolution equation for at first order as t d 1 d 3 f c 24 14 a plankton density with varied b chemical concentration with varied figure 7 the non constant steady states for the chemical concentration and plankton density for varied 0 0 015 0 03 0 045 for comparison purposes all steady states have been shifted to the center of the domain parameters can be found in appendix c 2 where d 3 f c d 2 by substituting the perturbations into 7 c and utilizing the same taylor expansion as in the one dimensional case for the terms with we obtain 25 t e 1 2 1 e 1 4 2 0 1 e d at first order we simplify 25 to become t e 1 2 2 e 1 4 26 taking the two dimensional fourier transform in both x and y of 24 and 26 while denoting k k 1 k 2 as the wave vector we get 27 a ht i k e h 1 2 h i 2 k e m 1 4 t 27 b mt d 3 d 1 k 2 m f c t where h m and t are the two dimensional fourier transforms of and respectively continuing we write h in terms of its fourier coefficients with respect to i e h k t n z hn k t e in 28 where hn c from this representation t can be written as t k t 2 0 h k t d 2 h 0 k t 29 we define the complexification of the wave number k as k 1 ik 2 and denote as the complex conjugate of we rewrite sin and cos in exponential forms and substitute 28 and 29 15 into 27 a 27 b by matching powers of ein we obtain the following infinite linear ode system where primes denote derivative with respect to t 30 a h 0 i 2 h 1 h 1 30 b h 1 i 2 h 0 h 2 1 2 h 1 i 4 m 30 c h 1 i 2 h 2 h 0

eigenvalue of a algebraically we will compute them numerically by truncating the matrix at an appropriate threshold denote an and yn as the truncated matrix a and vector y in 31 consisting of the equations with the functions h n h 1 h 0 m h 1 hn where n z is sufficiently large see next paragraph we now calculate the eigenvalues of the system y n an yn denote the set of these eigenvalues as i k 2 n 2 i 1 and define rn rn k max re i 2 n 2 i 1 then ku will be denoted as the norm of the most unstable wave number i e ku arg max k rn k 32 if ku 2 the set of parameters will make the constant solution c unstable in the domain 0 0 given a fixed set of parameters d 1 d 2 c and deposition function f c we vary k to find ku examples of the function rn k are shown in figs 8 a and 8 b where the parameters d 1 and d 2 are varied in a similar fashion to the one dimensional case fig 4 decreasing d 1 or increasing d 2 causes ku to increase and rn k approaches 1 2 as k approaches infinity in fig 8 c we found that n 100 fully resolved rn k this shows the rapid convergence of small k for all n and as n increases the approximation of large k behavior converges towards an asymptote at 1 2 we also highlight how c 0 the threshold parameter for the deposition functions changes the 16 stability of the constant solution in fig 8 d by increasing c 0 for f 2 in 12 a the function rn k for a constant deposition function with the same parameters is recovered finally figs 8 e and 8 f display the stability regions in the d 1 d 2 plane for two different values 0 001 and 0 004 as increases there are fewer steady states which will be unstable for a certain domain size 0 0 as with the one dimensional case the curve separating the stable and unstable regimes becomes linear as d 1 and d 2 both increase 5 2 linear growth and nonlinear saturation we now turn towards understanding the nonlinear saturation of unstable steady state solutions to our two dimensional model we analyze the lagrangian system for and c and show numerical results table 4 and fig 3 show the parameters and three deposition function we will utilize in our simulations respectively to initialize our system the density can be constructed as a summation of np point sources x t np i 1 x xi t 33 where xi is the position of each plankton and x is the dirac delta function initially all organisms are randomly distributed

e i c e i c 2 2 t 34 if a plankton tumbles a random direction is then chosen utilizing the turning kernel t i i 1 2 each particle then updates their position by xi t t xi t t cos i sin i 35 for autochemotaxis we calculate f c at these new positions using our deposition function of choice to deposit the chemical numerically we place a two dimensional gaussian centered at xi instead of using a dirac delta function we then evolve equation 7 a by utilizing a crank nicolson time stepping method see appendix d for more specific details regarding the simulations in fig 9 we display the evolution of a parameter regime which makes the constant solution c unstable and induce pattern formation to visualize more effectively we portray all np plankton as small two dimensional gaussians centered at

calculates the real part of the fourier modes of c i e e k t 0 re f c x t 0 k 36 where f is the two dimensional fourier transform to calculate this numerically we utilize a two dimensional fast fourier transform other than the translational mode of k 0 a wave vector whose norm is equal to ku see 32 should grow the quickest initially for this simulation the norm of the most unstable wave

aggregations occur and several modes grow quickly in the fourier domain the largest of which occurs at ku 6 as expected as time progresses the aggregations start to merge together and become more densely populated which can also be seen in e k as wave vectors with smaller norms emerge reflecting pattern formation unsurprisingly chemical concentrations are highest near the most densely populated areas of the plankton density we now discuss the effects the various deposition functions have on the development and struc ture of aggregations to equitably compare all three deposition functions parameters were found such that ku 6 while keeping d 1 d 2 and the same see table 4 the evolution of the plank ton densities can be seen in fig 10 there are few differences in the initial development of the aggregations as seen from the t 15 plots however starting at t 75 we qualitatively see marked differences the constant deposition function f 1 has more defined and densely populated aggregations and at long times it forms a singular dense and symmetric aggregation the switch function f 2 the linear switch function f 3 does have very populated areas throughout the domain and ends with a singular aggregation but the aggregations are much less symmetric and have snake like features for all simulations merging events occur more frequently early on rather than later due to the aggregations sizes we utilize three metrics to elucidate the differences between these deposition functions the first 19 figure 10 time series evolution of the plankton density described in section 5 2 with varied deposition functions for times t 15 75 150 225 and 300 the top row is f 1 c the second row is f 2 c and the third row is f 3 c defined in 12 a and 12 b all simulation parameters which can be found on table 4 in appendix d 2 are constructed to have ku 6 animations of these three simulations can be found on online resources 4 5 and 6 respectively of which is the total chemical in the system denote c t as the total chemical i e c t d c x t d x 37 where d 0 0 in fig 11 a the evolution of c t is shown for the three simulations all simulations were initialized with c x 0 c 0 01 and thus c 0 c 2 1 the long term behavior of all three simulations is decidedly varied with f 1 staying constant f 2 sharply declining before leveling out and f 3 having periods of plateaus and sharp declines proposition 3 the proof of which is in appendix b 3 shows that the constant deposition function admits no change in chemical if the chemical is initialized at c proposition 3 denote the total chemical concentration as c t defined in 37 let d 2 c f c be the constant steady state solution for 7 a 7 c on d 0 0 then if f c f 1 c and c 0 c 0 where c 0 0 then lim t c t c 2 38 the second metric we utilize is the difference between the maximum and minimum concentration of the chemical in the domain i e max c t min c t seen in fig 11 b this can give us insight into the density of the aggregations and the development of the chemical throughout the system at short times inset of fig 11 b this function grows linearly for all three deposition functions after the nonlinear saturation takes place the functions grow at different rates we see that f 1 20 a total chemical c t b difference in chemical max c t min c t c radial distribution function g r figure 11 plots a c display various metrics to differentiate between simulations of the various deposition functions for a the total chemical c t is calculated 37 for c the radial distribution function g r is defined in 39 all plots are averaged over six different simulations parameters for these simulations can be found in appendix d 2 continues to grow and outpaces both f 2 and f 3 which implies that the aggregations for f 1 continue to get more densely populated over time both f 2 and f 3 grow at a much slower rate than f 1 and reach a quasi equilibrium state for this max min function to quantitatively show differences between the structure of these deposition functions we uti lize the radial distribution function g r the radial distribution function rdf measures the probability of finding a pair of plankton a distance of r apart relative to the same probability for a completely uniform distribution of plankton the rdf g r is defined as haile et al 1993 wang et al 2019 g r 2 np np 1 np i 1 np j 1 j 6 i r rij 39 here np represents the total number of plankton in the system represents the size of the domain x represents the delta function and rij xi xj represents the euclidean distance between plankton i and j if g r 1 the probability is equivalent to a uniform distribution if g r 1 there is a greater probability of finding plankton a distance r apart relative to a uniform distribution and thus we expect an accumulation of plankton at a distance r apart similarly g r 1 21 a total chemical c t b mean value of c at a given t 300 figure 12 plots a and b show characteristics of varied plot a shows the the total chemical c t which is calculated in 37 plot b is the mean magnitude of the chemical gradient at a certain plankton density with error bars representing one standard deviation the two dashed lines represent 10 4 and 10 3 parameters for these simulations can be found in appendix d 2 corresponds to a dearth of plankton a distance r away to calculate g r numerically at a specific time t we calculate all distances rij bin these distances into a histogram and normalize with respect to the total number of distances calculated the rdfs are calculated for the various deposition functions over time and are shown in fig 11 c at t 15 we see that plankton become slightly more likely to find other organisms close to them r 1 for all deposition function however the plot of g r changes to reflect the dense aggregations formed by f 1 as seen in plots t 225 and t 300 we are much more likely to find plankton close together r 3 for simulations with f 1 than for f 2 and f 3 we see that the graphs of f 2 and f 3 stagnate at around t 150 whereas f 1 continues to evolve until the final timesteps one can also estimate the average size of the aggregations in the system by looking at the first instance where g r 1 we can then estimate at t 300 that the aggregation diameter for f 1 is roughly 3 5 units whereas f 2 and f 3 are both around 2 7 units even though the aggregation for f 2 is more densely packed since g r is greater finally we see that has a profound impact on the development of the chemical and plankton density in fig 12 we use varied along with the switch deposition function f 2 in fig 12 a we see that as 0 the total chemical in the system decreases and for 10 4 we see no significant difference in the function c t next we recognize that tumbling is only relevant where plankton are present we observe that larger aggregations tend to have near constant density interiors surrounded by transition areas leading to voids thus we expect to play a role in these high density non constant interiors to this end fig 12 b shows the mean value of the magnitude of the chemical gradient c at a given plankton density at t 300 the gradient in the interiors are on the order of 10 3 and when c we expect the nonlinear dynamics to change as is shown in the plot we infer that only has an impact inside the aggregation where the gradient is low and the density is high therefore the chemotactic sensitivity and numerical regularization parameter alters both the linear stability of the steady state see section 5 1 and the nonlinear saturated configuration of the plankton 22 6 discussion we now discuss our results from the previous sections by connecting them towards the experimental observations in section 2 our stability analysis in figs 4 and figs 8 gives us insight of how a constant solution c can become unstable and initiate plankton aggregations if we decrease d 1 or increase d 2 we are able to make the system more unstable i e as the chemical diffuses more slowly or decays more rapidly the plankton are more likely to aggregate also the importance of is evident implying that the ability of the model organism to respond to weak gradients could be one of the keys to understanding the persistent patterns observed in nature as shown by sengupta et al 2017 turning towards the long term behavior seen in sections 4 2 and 5 2 by implementing only run and tumble and autochemotaxis we gather rich behavior in one and two dimensions that is very similar to the the pattern formation we see in our model organism see fig 2 from simulations seen in figs 5 and 9 we observe several aggregations initially form and merge but as aggregations coarsened and expanded merging events occurred on much larger timescales specifically in the two dimensional case simulations such as fig 10 which show the rapid organization of aggregations and subsequent long time saturation towards larger non circular aggregations reflect the structure and evolution patterns we see in experiments highlighted in section 2 as expected we are able to predict that the chemical concentration is highest near the peaks of the aggregations however the shape and evolution of these plankton aggregations and chemical concentrations are dependent on the properties of the deposition function and we studied three different deposition functions and saw very different results for all three by comparing deposition functions that admit similar most unstable wave numbers we were able to focus on the non linear development after the initial perturbation becomes apparent in both the one and two dimensional cases the constant function f 1 is the most comparable to the evolution dynamics seen in our simulations when light saturated the environment the switch function f 2 forces the plankton to aggregate more slowly and merge on a different timescale than the other deposition functions the linear switch function f 3 produced even though f 2 and f 3 produced more unique aggregations this may accurately reflect the speed of merging when there is no light as in fig 1 b lastly our long time simulations varying in both the one and two dimensional cases stress the significance of a plankton s chemotactic sensitivity as increases the aggregations are much more spread out and less defined as well as decreases plankton are more sensitive to the envi ronment and thus can sustain aggregations mild gradients compare these results to experimental long term behavior as in fig 2 e the aggregations after 60 minutes are relatively varied as some are densely populated whereas others are spread out much more this may imply that the plank ton s chemotactic sensitivity is influenced by biological mechanics related to a plankton s response towards light 7 conclusions and future work we conducted several experiments to understand aggregation patterns of phytoplankton using our model organism heterosigma akashiwo from these experiments it is evident that chemotaxis plays an important role in plankton aggregations as these aggregations form in absence of external fluid flow and light to describe this system we have constructed a one and two dimensional 23 partial differential equation model of plankton with run and tumble motion and autochemotaxis we explored the complex dynamics of the models by analytically describing the linear stability of constant steady states and numerically analyzing the nonlinear saturation and long time behavior by varying parameters we investigated the diverse dynamics of this model from stability analysis to structural differences at steady state since the deposition functions for plankton are unknown we chose three simple deposition functions to simulate through simulations these functions revealed striking differences in chemical and plankton aggregation patterns some of which are similar to experimental observations there is still much to be explored in this line of research there are several significant biological and physical mechanisms such as plankton photosynthesis vertical migration towards and away from light and a non uniform turning kernel t which is biologically relevant that need to be incorporated to understand plankton aggregation formation dodson et al 1997 chen et al 2018 extending this model to three dimensions may allow us to understand the extreme change in pattern formation seen in fig 1 a we also will conduct more experimentation with collaborators to find parameters and deposition function which describes the behavior of heterosigma akaswhio

combination of moving particles representing an ensemble of plankton therefore we introduce the plankton density coefficient d recall that is the constant steady state solution to the 2 d system and define the particle density as np 2 in order to scale the autochemotactic term appropriately each of the np particles must represent a small aggregation of plankton to represent the specified density on the computational domain using np particles we require that d np 2 d 2 np 57 thus for the autochemotactic term each particle deposits chemical with strength df c the chemical field is approximated on a mesh w we use a periodic 0 0 domain and we define d as the 2 cm 2 cm two dimensional spectral chebyshev differentiation matrix on the domain 0 0 with periodic boundary conditions we denote n and cn as the nth time step of the plankton density and chemical concentration where n is a summation of point sources n np i 1 xni 58 and xni x n i y n i is the position of the ith plankton at the nth time step we define t as the temporal mesh size x y cm as the spatial mesh size and x and y as the spatial mesh for the chemical concentration c in the x and y directions respectively 31 to initialize the system recall that the constant steady state solution to 7 a 7 c is d 2 c f c we select a c d 2 and f c and then solve for d 2 c f c all n organisms are randomly distributed throughout the domain and given a random orientation i for the n 1 th iteration we complete the following steps 1 decide if plankton will tumble to a new direction using the probability described in 34 if a plankton does tumble their new direction is selected randomly from a uniform distribution n 1 i 0 2 2 move all np plankton to their new position using 35 which updates n to n 1 3 compute sn 1 i f cn xn 1 i where xn 1 i is the ith plankton s position calculated from step 2 we compute cn xn 1 i the chemical concentration at a particle position using a bivariate spline interpolation 4 deposit the chemical in order to do deposit the chemical we construct the matrix sn 1 np i 1 sn 1 i 4 2 exp xn 1 i x 2 yn 1 i y 2 4 2 59 where the variance is 2 k td 1 and k is an suitable constant in the simulations we have chosen k 3 5 evolve the chemical concentration using a crank nicholson method similar to the one dimensional case in 55 cn 1 i t 2 d 1 d 2 d 2 i 1 i t 2 d 1 d 2 d 2 i cn t d sn 1 60 where i is the identity matrix of appropriate size for all simulations in section 5 we utilize t 0 2 x y 0 025 cm 200 and 10 using these parameters along with all others used in simulations described in section 5 2 the largest wave number we are able to resolve has a magnitude of k 41 this mode along with others with larger magnitude are stable in all of the simulations and thus all important wave numbers are resolved d 2 parameters table 4 shows all parameters used in the two dimensional simulations in section 5 details about a specific variable or notation can be found in tables 1 and 2 for all
