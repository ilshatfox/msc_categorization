conjugate to s x x where s x t p x x for some function p x z in 1985 arnoux ornstein and weiss showed that any aperiodic not necessarily ergodic measure preserving system is isomorphic to a speedup of any ergodic measure preserving system in this paper we study speedups in the topological category specifically we consider minimal homeomorphisms on cantor spaces our main theorem gives conditions on when one such system is a speedup of another furthermore the main theorem serves as a topological analogue of the arnoux ornstein and weiss speedup theorem as well as a one sided orbit equivalence theorem 1 introduction in this paper we characterize in the topological setting when one minimal can tor system is a speedup of another this theorem builds upon two different theorems in dynamics one theorem from the measure theoretic category the other from the topological category our main theorem is a topological analogue of the speedup theorem of arnoux ornstein and weiss aow 85 their theorem shows that the realization of a measure preserving system as a speedup of another is very general however there are restrictions that arise in the topological category the form of our characterization is very similar to the remarkable theorem of giordano putnam and skau gps 95 theorem 2 2 in that both theorems the dynamical relations are characterized by associated ordered groups or associated simplices of invariant measures whereas in gps 95 they have bijective morphisms from one object onto the other in our characterization theorem we get surjective and injective mor phisms respectively furthermore through the similarity of these theorems we can relate topological speedups to topological orbit equivalence for example given a pair of minimal cantor systems both of which are uniquely ergodic if one or both systems is a speedup of the other then the two systems are orbit equivalent these results follow in a long line of results coming from several different research areas of dynamics the first and perhaps most general is that of finding topological analogues for results stemming from ergodic theory one example which we will mention a few times throughout this paper is the topological analogue to the classical ergodic theory result of dye dye 59 recall dye s theorem says that any two ergodic transformations on non atomic lebesgue probability spaces are orbit equivalent over 35 years later giordano putnam and skau gave a complete characterization of when two minimal cantor systems are orbit equivalent in the topological category unlike in the measure theoretic category not all minimal cantor systems are orbit equivalent in the topological category date october 25 2019 1 http arxiv org abs 1605 08446 v 1 p re pr in t 2 drew d ash another line of research we follow is that of speedups themselves speedups have mostly been studied in the measurable category by a speedup of a fixed aperiodic measure preserving transformation x b t we mean an automorphism of the form s x t p x x p x z one of the earliest people to study speedups though they were not called this until later was neveu in 1969 he had two papers n 1 69 n 2 69 the latter would eventually give restrictions on what systems can be speedup to each other assuming integrability of p the first major result after neveu came in 1985 with arnoux ornstein and weiss when they showed for any ergodic measure preserving transformation x b t and any aperiodic not necessarily ergodic y c s there is a b measurable function p x z such that s x t p x x is invertible a e and x b s is isomorphic to y c s finding a topological analogue to this theorem was the inspiration and impetus for this paper interest in measure theoretic speedups has been rekindled as evidenced by the papers by bbf 13 jm 14 the final line of research our paper follows is that of topological orbit equiv alence recall that x t and y s are orbit equivalent if there exists a space isomorphism f x y such that for every x x f orbitt x orbits f x again dye s theorem says that in the measurable category any two ergodic trans formations on non atomic lebesgue probability spaces are orbit equivalent this is not the case in the topological category in 1995 giordano putnam and skau completely characterized orbit equivalence in the topological category in doing so they introduced two new orbit equivalence invariants namely the dimension group and having the simplices of invariants measures be affinely isomorphic via a space homeomorphism we restate their characterization theorem here theorem 1 1 gps 95 theorem 2 2 let xi ti be cantor systems i 1 2 the following are equivalent 1 x 1 t 1 and x 2 t 2 are orbit equivalent 2 the dimension groups k 0 xi ti inf k 0 xi ti i 1 2 are order iso morphic by a map preserving the distinguished order units 3 there exits a homeomorphism f x 1 x 2 carrying the t 1 invariant probability measures onto the t 2 invariant probability measures above k 0 xi ti inf k 0 xi ti is the group of continuous functions from xi to the integers modulo the subgroup of functions which integrate to 0 against every ti invariant borel probability measure we can view speedups through the lens of orbit equivalence by observing that if x 2 t 2 is a speedup of x 1 t 1 then there exists a homeomorphism f x 1 x 2 such that for every x x 1 we have f orbit t 1 x orbit t 2 f x our main theorem stated below has a very similar form to theorem 1 1 above main theorem let x 1 t 1 and x 2 t 2 be minimal cantor systems the fol lowing are equivalent 1 x 2 t 2 is a speedup of x 1 t 1 2 there exists k 0 x 2 t 2 inf k 0 x 2 t 2 k 0 x 1 t 1 inf k 0 x 1 t 1 a surjective group homomorphism such that k 0 x 2 t 2 k 0 x 1 t 1 and preserves the distinguished order units p re pr in t topological speedups 3 3 there exists homeomorphism f x y such that f m x 1 t 1 m x 2 t 2 is an injection here we can see the one sided and reciprocal nature of our main theorem in stead of having bijective morphims as is the case in giordano putnam and skau s result we alternatively have either surjective or injective morphisms from one ob ject to the other surjective morphism preserving the order unit and taking one positive cone onto the other in the dimension group setting and an injection aris ing from a space homeomorphism from one simplex of invariant measures to the other in section 5 we will prove our main theorem and what s more having a sur jective morphism on the dimension groups induces an injective morphism on the simplices of invariant measures or states associated to the dimension group hence illustrating the reciprocal nature of speedups furthermore as a consequence of both the main theorem and theorem 1 1 in the case of uniquely ergodic minimal cantor system speedups characterize orbit equivalence that is given two uniquely ergodic minimal cantor systems if one is a speedup of the other then the systems are orbit equivalent in section 6 of the paper we will define speedup equivalence and show that speedup equivalence and orbit equivalence are the same in systems with finitely many ergodic measures finally we conclude the paper by presenting an example which shows that speedups can leave the orbit equivalence class of a given minimal transformation 2 preliminaries 2 1 minimal cantor systems as a general reference for dynamics we recom mend w bs pe throughout this paper x will always be taken to be a cantor space that is a compact metrizable perfect zero dimensional space a cantor system will consist of a pair x t where x is a cantor space and t x x is a homeomorphism in addition we will require that our homeomorphism be minimal by which we mean that every orbit is dense specifically for every x in x we have that ot x t n x x z x where ot x denotes the orbit of the point x we call such systems x t minimal cantor systems it is well known see w that we can replace the density of all full orbits with the density of just the forward orbits thus a homeomorphism t is minimal if for every x x we have that o t x t n x n n x where o t x denotes the forward orbit of the point x a helpful example which will be referenced throughout the paper is the dyadic odometer here we take x 0 1 n where 0 1 is endowed with the discrete topology making x into a cantor space we define t to be 1 and carry to the right so for example 000 t 7 100 t 7 010 t 7 110 t 7 001 formally t can be defined as t x i 0 if i n 1 if i n x i if i n p re pr in t 4 drew d ash where n is the least positive integer such that x n 0 and t maps the constantly 1 sequence to the constantly 0 sequence the triadic odometer which is mentioned later in the paper is similarly defined on 0 1 2 n minimal cantor systems exhibit a wonderful structure namely the existence of a refining sequence of kakutani rokhlin tower partitions these tower partitions defined below were instrumental in relating minimal cantor systems to bratteli diagrams and hence dimension groups af algebras and many other beautiful results definition 2 1 a kakutani rokhlin tower partition of a minimal cantor system x t is a clopen partition p of x of the form p t jck k v 0 j hk where v is a finite set ck is a clopen set and hk is a positive integer by fixing a k we may refer to a column of the partition t jck 0 j hk and hk is referred to the height of the column the set t jck is the j th level of the kth column furthermore we refer to c k v ck as the base of the kakutani rokhlin tower partition a visualization of a kakutani rokhlin tower partition is provided below c 1 t c 2 t t ck t t t t note t maps the top of each column into the base and in only special cases does the top of any column map onto the first level of that column a nice property of these kakutani rokhlin tower partitions is that they can have arbitrarily high columns heights and can refine any clopen partition the space we summarize these properties in the following two propositions proposition 2 2 let x t be a minimal cantor system and n z be given there exists a kakutani rokhlin tower partition of x t j ci 1 i t 0 j hi such that for i 1 2 t hi n p re pr in t topological speedups 5 proposition 2 3 let x t be a minimal cantor system q a clopen partition of x and p a kakutani rokhlin tower partition of x specifically p t j ci 1 i t 0 j hi then we can refine p into p such that p refines q and p maintains its tower structure that is p t j c i 1 i t 0 j h i where t is the new number of columns and h i is the new height of the i th column putting the following definition and propositions together we get a fundamental theorem not only for this paper but for the study of minimal cantor systems in general theorem 2 4 let x t be a minimal cantor system and let x x there exists a sequence of kakutani rokhlin tower partitions p n n n with p n t jbi n 1 i t n 0 j hi n satisfying 1 n n 1 i t n bi n x 2 for every n we have that p n 1 is finer than p n i e p n p n 1 for every n 3 n n p n generates the topology of x we will make extensive use of this theorem throughout the proof of the main result of this paper 2 2 invariant measures associated to minimal cantor systems in this section we will review some standard facts about invariant measures associated to topological dynamical systems and fix notation then we will introduce the definition of a dynamical simplex or d simplex which is due to heidi dahl and was inspired by and extended the notion of a good measure introduced by ethan akin in a 05 first recall that the bogolioubov krylov theorem says that any continuous trans formation of a compact metric space has an invariant borel probability measure fix a minimal cantor system x t and let m x denote the collection of all borel probability measures on x we are interested in the measures in m x which are t invariant and we denote the collection of all t invariant borel probability mea sures by m x t i e m x t m x t 1 a a for every borel subset a again by bogolioubov krylov m x t 6 the set m x t has a very nice structure as it is a choquet simplex with respect to the weak topology that is m x t is a compact convex subset of m x in which every measure can be uniquely represented as an integral against a measure which is fully supported on the extreme points denoted by e m x t furthermore recall that a measure is full or has full support if gives positive measure to every non empty open set also we say that a measure is non atomic if gives measure 0 to singletons we are now ready to define a d simplex p re pr in t 6 drew d ash definition 2 5 dahl let k m x be a choquet simplex consisting of non atomic probability measures with full support we say that k is a dynamical simplex abbreviated d simplex if it satisfies the following two conditions 1 for clopen subsets a and b of x with a b for all k there exists a clopen subset b 1 b such that a b 1 for all k this is known as the subset condition 2 if ek 6 then and are mutually singular i e there exists a measurable set a x such that a 1 and a 0 it is well known that for any minimal cantor system x t m x t is a cho quet simplex whose extreme points are mutually singular see w chapter 6 the fact that all measures are non atomic and full both follow from x being uncount able coupled with t being a minimal transformation showing m x t is actually a d simplex follows immediately from a proof of lemma 2 5 from glasner and weiss gw 95 from this we have the following theorem theorem 2 6 let x t be a minimal cantor system the set m x t is a d simplex the fact that m x t is a d simplex will play a role in the proof of the main theorem 2 3 ordered groups and dimension groups one of the more recent tools in the study of minimal cantor systems and in particular in the study of topological orbit equivalence is the dimension group dimensions groups were first defined by elliot in ell 76 using inductive limits of groups however the definitions which follow are an equivalent and more abstract way of defining dimension groups which is due to effros handelman and shen ehs 80 before we can define what a dimension group is we must first introduce partially ordered groups a general reference for parially ordered abelian groups is g for references specifically related to dynamics we refer the reader to hps 92 gps 95 and for a summary see d in this paper we will deal exclusively countable abelian groups definition 2 7 a partially ordered group is a countable abelain group g to gether with a special subset denoted g referred to as the positive cone satisfying the following 1 g g g 2 g g g 3 g g 0 since we are calling these groups partially ordered given a b g we will write a b if b a g and we can define a strict inequality a b by requesting that b a g 0 we will further require that our partially ordered abelian groups be unperforated by which we mean if a g and na g for some n z then a g we press on towards defining what a dimension group is with the final condition the riesz interpolation property definition 2 8 a partially ordered group is said to satisfy the riesz interpo lation property if given a 1 a 2 b 1 b 2 g with ai bj for i j 1 2 then there p re pr in t topological speedups 7 exists c g such that ai c bj for i j 1 2 finally we have enough background to define a dimension group definition 2 9 a dimension group is an unperforated ordered group g g which satisfies the riesz interpolation property an example of a dimension group which will appear multiple times in this paper is z 1 2 z 1 2 where z 1 2 a 2 b a z b n and z 1 2 x z 1 2 x 0 in fact this dimension group is the exact dimension group associated to the dyadic odometer furthermore a theorem by giordano putnam and skau which we will give later in the paper showed that nearly all dimension groups arise from minimal cantor systems there are two other properties of dimension groups we must discuss before mov ing forward the first being the notion of an order unit definition 2 10 let g g be a partially ordered group we call u g an order unit if for every a g there exists an n n such that a nu furthermore any dimension group with an order unit will be called a unital dimension group note 1 plays the role of an ordered unit in our example above which makes z 1 2 z 1 2 1 a unital dimension group finally when dealing with minimal cantors systems we only encounter simple dimension groups defined below seeing as our groups are abelian simple does not refer to the group being simple but rather posits that the order ideal structure is simple definition 2 11 an order ideal is a subgroup j so that 1 j j j where j j g 2 if 0 a b j then a j and a dimension group is simple if it has no non trivial order ideals from now on we will only concern ourself with simple dimension groups there are many connections between dimension groups and minimal cantor systems and we will highlight some of these connections later in the paper we need another definition definition 2 12 let g be a simple dimension group with a fixed order unit u g 0 we say that a homomorphism p g r is a state if p is positive i e p g 0 and p u 1 states play an important role in the order structure of these dimension groups to see this let g g u be a unital simple dimension group i e g g is a simple dimension group and u is an order unit and let su g denote the collection of all states on g it is known that states always exists and so su g 6 now paraphrasing a result of effros e cor 4 2 we have that g a g p a 0 for all p su g 0 this tells us that by knowing the states we know the order structure of g further more we can make at least one connection with minimal cantor systems which p re pr in t 8 drew d ash we will make explicit once we have more notation in that states on the dimension group correspond exactly to invariant measures for the minimal cantor system as sociated to this dimension group hence there always exists at least one state just as there always exists at least one invariant measure we now would like to single out special elements of any simple dimension group g g first fix g g a simple unital dimension group with u g 0 an ordered unit we say that a g is an infinitesimal if p a 0 for every p su g we will let inf g denote the collection of all infinitesimals of g and we note that it is a subgroup of g furthermore if we start with a dimension group g and form the quotient group g inf g the quotient has a natural order structure coming from g in that a 0 if a 0 from this it can be seen that g inf g becomes a dimension group in its own right and has no infintesimals other than 0 2 4 dimension groups and dynamical system in the section we will give a brief introduction to some basic definitions notation and theorems about dimen sion groups associated to minimal cantor systems for a more detailed and moti vational exploration of these links we implore the reader to see gps 95 hps 92 given a minimal cantor system x t let c x z denote the collection of all continuous z valued functions on x this is a countable abelian group under addition furthermore define k 0 x t c x z f f t f c x z we denote by bt f f t f c x z and call it collection of coboundaries define the positive cone the positive elements to be k 0 x t f f 0 f c x z also let 1 denote the constantly 1 function on x we now have the following theorem relating dimension groups arising from minimal cantor systems theorem 2 13 gps 95 theorem 1 12 let x t be a minimal cantor system then k 0 x t with positive cone k 0 x t is a simple acyclic i e g z di mension group with canonical distinguished order unit 1 furthermore if g g is a simple acyclic dimension group with distinguished order unit u there exists a minimal cantor system x t so that g g u k 0 x t k 0 x t 1 meaning that there exists an order isomorphism g k 0 x t so that u 1 the use of these dimension groups has been used to completely classify minimal cantor systems up to strong orbit equivalence and orbit equivalence see gps 95 the dimension group we concern ourselves with in this paper are dimension groups modulo their infinitesimals as mentioned previously there is a lovely connection between states of a dimension group and invariant measures which we will make explicit now we then can give a simple characterization of the dimension groups that will appear in this paper first we present the following theorem theorem 2 14 gps 95 theorem 1 13 let x t be a minimal cantor system then 1 every t invariant probability measure on x induces a state t on k 0 x t k 0 x t 1 by f fd f c x z p re pr in t topological speedups 9 2 the map t is a bijective correspondence between the set of t invariant prob ability measures on x and the set of states on k 0 x t k 0 x t 1 one can verify that this theorem still holds true on k 0 x t inf k 0 x t we now have seen states arise as integration against an invariant measure hence let zt f c x z fd 0 m x t we then have inf k 0 x t zt bt f c x z fd 0 m x t bt thus k 0 x t inf k 0 x t c x z zt and the order unit 1 is preserved when c x z zt is endowed with the induced order of f 0 if f 0 in c x z 3 speedups in this section we will define what we mean by a speedup of a minimal cantor system x t furthermore we explore some of its basic properties which will lead up to the main theorem of the paper first we define what a speedup is definition 3 1 let x 1 t 1 and x 2 t 2 be minimal cantor systems we say x 2 t 2 is a speedup of x 1 t 1 if x 2 t 2 is conjugate to x s where s is a minimal homeomorphism of x defined by s x t p x 1 x where p x z for example if x t is the dyadic odometer then x t 3 would constitute a speedup of x t as it is again a minimal cantor system now we would like to point out that our definition of speedup is a bit more general in that any minimal cantor system which is conjugate to x t 3 is also considered to be a speedup of x t we remark that x t 2 or anything conjugate to x t 2 cannot be a speedup of x t as t 2 is not minimal in the paper by arnoux ornstein and weiss aow 85 p is a measurable map in the topological category we make the observation that if t p is to be continuous then p must be lower semicontinuous proposition 3 2 let p x z and suppose that t p x x s x is a minimal cantor system then p is lower semicontinuous hence a borel map proof first we show that for every n z we have p 1 n is closed let n z xm m 1 p 1 n and x x such that xm x since both s and t n are continuous we have that s xm s x and t n xm t n x since for every m s xm t n xm and by uniqueness of limits we have that s x t n x we may conclude p x n as a result of t being aperiodic by virtue of being a minimal transformation on a cantor space p re pr in t 10 drew d ash recall that a real valued function is lower semicontinuous on a topological space if x x f x is open for every real now let r be given observe that for any there are only finitely many n z such that n thus x p x n p 1 n is a finite union of closed sets whence is closed consequently x p x is open therefore p is lower semicontinuous as desired remark 3 3 if p is continuous then p must be bounded as x is compact however the converse is true as well that is if p is bounded and defines a speedup s then p is continuous this follows almost immediately from the previous proposition in this case where p is bounded finitely valued or continuous and s x t p x x is a speedup of t we call these bounded speedups bounded speedups are interesting in their own right for example by n 2 69 entropy restrictions arise in what systems can be speedups of others however bounded speedups are beyond the scope of this paper one important aspect of speedups is how they interact with the invariant mea sures of the original system the following proposition gives the relationship be tween the invariant measures of the original system and speedups of it further more we have an example which shows the relationship below can be strict thus showing that speedups can leave the conjugacy class of the original system we ll discuss this more later in the paper before we prove this relationship it will be useful to be able to refer to following proposition proposition 3 4 suppose x t is a minimal cantor system then m x t m x t 1 we now show how speedups interact with the invariant measures of the original system proposition 3 5 let x t be a minimal cantor system if x s is a speedup of x t then m x t m x s proof let p x z be such that s x t p x x is a minimal homeomorophism of x and let m x t observe by proposition 3 4 it suffices to simply show p re pr in t topological speedups 11 that m x s 1 let a b x we then have s a s n z a p 1 n n z s a p 1 n n z t n a p 1 n n z t n a p 1 n n z a p 1 n as m x t a notice that this proposition gives us an immediate restriction on when one system can be a speedup of another for example the previous proposition rules out the possibility of the triadic odometer being a speedup of the dyadic odometer and vice versa as both systems are uniquely ergodic and do not share the same clopen value set the natural question to ask is is this the only such restriction we answer this and more with the statement of the main theorem of the paper theorem 3 6 let x 1 t 1 and x 2 t 2 be minimal cantor systems and let g 1 c x 1 z zt 1 and g 2 c x 2 z zt 2 where zti g c x z gd 0 m xi ti the following are equivalent 1 x 2 t 2 is a speedup of x 1 t 1 2 there exists g 2 g 2 1 g 1 g 1 1 a surjective group homomorophism such that g 2 g 1 and 1 1 3 there exists homeomorphism f x y such that f m x 1 t 1 m x 2 t 2 is an injection we will break up the proof of the main theorem into three sections as each part of the proof requires a different set of lemmas the main difficulty is proving 3 implies 1 3 1 proof of 1 implies 2 proof since x 2 t 2 is a speedup of x 1 t 1 x 2 t 2 is conjugate through a conjugacy k to x s where s x x s x t p x 1 x and p x z let h 1 c x z zs and h 1 h 1 1 be the unital di mension group associated to x s hence right composition of k induces a p re pr in t 12 drew d ash unital dimension group isomorphism 1 h 1 h 1 1 g 2 g 2 1 define 2 g 2 g 2 1 g 1 g 1 1 by 2 g s g t 1 observe proposition 3 5 gives us zs zt 1 whence 2 is well defined it is standard to check that 2 is a surjective group homomorphism see the third isomorphism theorem for groups moreover as right composition by k doesn t affect positivity of elements nor does it alter the order unit one can verify 2 g 2 g 1 and 2 1 1 therefore 2 1 is our desired group homomorphism 3 2 proof of 2 implies 3 in order to proceed from 2 to 3 we would like to make use of gps 95 thm 2 2 to do so we will need to extend the first isomorphism theorem from groups to partially ordered abelian groups with interpolation we recall for the reader one of the main theorems from gps 95 theorem 3 7 gps 95 theorem 2 2 let xi ti be cantor systems i 1 2 the following are equivalent i x 1 t 1 and x 2 t 2 are orbit equivalent ii the dimension groups k 0 xi ti inf k 0 xi ti i 1 2 are order iso morphic by a map preserving the distinguished order units iii there exits a homeomorphism f x 1 x 2 carrying the t 1 invariant prob ability measures onto the t 2 invariant probability measures furthermore recall what an isomorphism is in the category of unital partially ordered abelian groups with interpolation definition 3 8 an isomorphism between two unital partially ordered abelian groups say g g u and h h v is a map g h a group and order isomorphism and u v in such a case we say that g g u is isomorphic to h h v written g g u h h v we now proceed with a short proof of the first isomorphism theorem in the category of partially ordered abelian groups with interpolation theorem 3 9 let g g u and h h v be unital dimension groups if h g is a surjective order and order unit preserving homomorphism with h g then h ker h ker v g g u as unital dimension groups proof define h ker g by h h for h h by the first isomorphism theorem for groups is a group isomorphism thus it suffices to show that h ker g and v u these follow immediately as h g and v u we will need one more proposition before tackling 2 3 and it begins to illustrate the reciprocal nature of the main theorem p re pr in t topological speedups 13 proposition 3 10 let g 2 g 1 be as in 2 of theorem 3 6 then there exists an injection m x 1 t 1 m x 2 t 2 proof we will show that induces an injective map on m x 1 t 1 into the state space of g 2 from there we appeal to theorem 2 14 which says that the states and invariant measures are in bijective correspondence composing these two functions gives us our injection from m x 1 t 1 into m x 2 t 2 let m x 1 t 1 h c y z and define h x h d x g d where g c x z and g h let us first show that is well defined let h c y z and g 1 g 2 c x z be such that g 1 g 2 h thus there exists i inf g such that g 1 i g 2 now we calculate x g 2 d x g 1 i d x g 1 d so is well defined since is order unit preserving we see that 1 x 1 d 1 to see that is positive let h c y z be such that for every x h x 0 thus h h and whence h 0 as is positive so there exists g c x z such that for every x g x 0 and g h thus h x g d 0 finally to see that is a homomorphism let h 1 h 2 c y z observe h 1 h 2 x h 1 h 2 d x h 1 h 2 d x h 1 h 2 d x h 1 d x h 2 d h 1 h 2 therefore is a state on g 2 as desired now we will show that is injective let m x 1 t 1 such that 6 so there exists a clopen set c such that x 1 c d c 6 c x 1 c d p re pr in t 14 drew d ash since h g there exists h c y z for every x h x 0 such that h 1 c rather 1 c h now we compute h x 1 c d c 6 c x 1 c d h so is injective recall e cor 4 2 which says that the set of states is in bijective correspondence with the set of invariant measures and so we get our desired injection by composing with this bijection with theorem 3 9 proposition 3 10 and theorem 2 2 of gps 95 at our dis posal we wish to dispense of 2 3 proof by assuming 2 and in conjunction with theorem 3 9 we know that is an unital dimension group isomorphism g 2 ker g 2 ker 1 g 1 g 1 1 so in particular g 2 ker g 2 ker 1 is itself a unital dimension group as a result of the isomorphism g 2 ker g 2 ker 1 must have one infini tesimal namely 0 furthermore h 1 ker is determined by m x 1 t 1 by proposition 3 10 by gps 95 thm 2 2 there exists a homeomorphism f x 1 x 2 such that the invariant measures associated to x 1 t 1 are taken bijectively onto the g invariant measures where g is a minimal realization of g 2 ker g 2 ker 1 by theorem 2 13 finally proposition 3 10 also shows that the invariant measures associated to g 2 ker are a subset of m x 2 t 2 and we have our injection from m x 1 t 1 into m x 2 t 2 via a space homeomorphism from x 1 to x 2 as desired note that x 2 g and x 1 t 1 are orbit equivalent as a result gps 95 thm 2 2 since their dimension groups modulo infinitesimals are isomorphic as dimension groups 3 3 proof of 3 implies 1 this is by far the most technical portion of the paper the idea of the proof is quite similar to the construction presented in the arnoux ornstein and weiss paper aow 85 in fact our key lemma lemma 3 16 is a topological version of the key lemma from aow 85 and a modification of proposition 2 6 from gw 95 note a key difference in our lemma is the range of our p map is z instead of z this lemma allows us to actually construct the speedup on the non final levels on a kakutani rokhlin tower partition before moving forward with the construction to prove 3 implies 1 we will prove a short sequence of lemmas culminating with our key lemma lemma 3 16 again many of the following propositions and lemmas are similar to propositions and lemmas found in gw 95 proposition 3 11 let x t be a minimal cantor system we have for every 0 there exists a nonempty clopen set c such that for all m x t c proof suppose towards a contradiction there exists an 0 such that for every non empty clopen set c there exists m x t such that c fix x x let cn b 1 n x and let n be a measure in m x t such that n cn by p re pr in t topological speedups 15 compactness of m x t there exists m x t and nk such that nk weak clearly n 1 cn k 1 cnk x and so x lim k cnk and we claim that for all k z cnk fix k z since cnk is clopen we have by definition cnk lim j nj cnk and for k j we have that cnk cnj nj cnk nj cnj thus cnk so we see that x lim k cnk 0 contradicting the fact that must be non atomic we immediately use this proposition to prove the following lemma lemma 3 12 let x t be a minimal cantor system then for every 0 there exists 0 such that for every a b x with diam a and every m x t we have a proof let 0 be given by proposition 3 11 there exists a non empty clopen set c such that for all m x t 0 c since c is non empty clopen and as t is minimal there exists n z such that x n i n t i c let 0 be the lebesgue number for the open cover t ic ni n recall that a lebesgue number for an open covering a of a compact metric space x is a constant 0 such that for each subset of x having diameter less than there exists an element of a containing it now let a b x with diam a then diam a a t i c for some i n n a t i c for every m x t a c as m x t a so for every m x t and a b x with diam a we have a as desired before we can state and prove one of our key lemmas we need one more propo sition p re pr in t 16 drew d ash proposition 3 13 let x t be a minimal cantor system and f x r a continuous function if inf x f d m x t c 0 then there exists a n 0 n such that for every n n 0 and for all x x we have 1 n n 1 j 0 f t j x c proof fix f c x r and suppose towards a contradiction that our proposition is false that is there is no such n 0 n so there exists nk k 0 and xk k 0 such that nk and for a fixed k

all borel probability measures onx there exists m x and increasing sequence k l 0 such that k weak recall by w theorem 6 9 m x t we will now show that x f d c which will give us our contradiction since f is continuous we have that x f d lim x f d k lim 1 n nk 1 j 0 f t j xk c this is a contradiction which proves our proposition we use propositions 3 11 and 3 13 in conjunction with lemma 3 12 to prove lemma 3 14 this lemma serves as a precursor to the key lemma and is instru mental for proving lemma 3 16 lemma 3 14 let x t be a minimal cantor system and let a b be non empty disjoint clopen subsets of x if for all m x t a b then there exists p a z such that s a b defined as s x t p x x is a homeomorphism onto its image proof let a b be disjoint clopen subsets of x and define f 1 b 1 a since both a and b are clopen it follows that f x z is continuous moreover since p re pr in t topological speedups 17 fd 0 for every m x t and m x t is compact in the weak topology it follows by assumption that inf x f d m x t 0 choose c r so that inf x f d m x t c 0 so by proposition 3 13 find n 0 large such that for every n n 0 and every x x we have 1 n n 1 j 0 f t jx c use proposition 2 2 to construct a kakutani rokhlin tower partition of x such that for each i hi n 0 let the following denote our tall kakuntani rokhlin tower partition t j di 1 i t 0 j hi use proposition 2 3 to refine each tower with respect to the partition a b a b c by a slight abuse of notation we will not rename our new kakutani rokhlin tower partition and with that let us look at a single column of our partition fix i 1 and consider the column t j d 1 0 j h 1 let x d 1 then as h 1 n 0 we must have that 1 1 h 1 h 1 1 j 0 f t jx c 0 thus there are more b levels than a levels in this column in other words let j and k be defined below j j 1 j 2 jm t ji d 1 a 6 i 1 2 m k k 1 k 2 kr t ki d 1 b 6 i 1 2 r and by 1 we have that j k choose any injection j k we exploit the inherit order structure of the column to define our map p first we give a picture with an arbitrary injection to help the reader visualize what is going on all a levels in our first column are colored red and all of the b levels in p re pr in t 18 drew d ash the first column are colored blue d 1 t d 1 t 2 d 1 t 3 d 1 t 4 d 1 t 5 d 1 t 6 d 1 t 7 d 1 t p we break the definition of t p into the following two cases first fix i 1 2 m case 1 ji ji in this case we can simply define p t ji d 1 z by p x ji ji by assumption p is positive and as t is a homeomorphism we have t p t ji ji is a homeomorphism from t ji d 1 a to t ji d 1 b furthermore we see that t p t ji d 1 t ji ji t jid 1 t ji d 1 b note t p simply moves x up the requisite number of levels in the tower as t ji d 1 lies above t j 1 d 1 in the column by assumption this finishes the first case case 2 ji ji in this case we see that we must map an a level into a b level which is below it in our column in this case we can t move down the tower as p must be positively valued to this end let t t ji d 1 t ji d 1 be the first return map where recall x inf n 0 t nx t ji d 1 the map is well defined by virtue of t j 1 d 1 being clopen and t minimal more over one can see that is continuous hence is finitely valued as t j 1 d 1 is compact furthermore it is well known that t t j 1 d 1 t j 1 d 1 is a home omorphism if we let s t ji ji t we have that s t ji d 1 t ji is a homeomorphism and the resulting p function on t ji d 1 is p x x ji ji thus all that is left to show is that p is a positive function however let t ji d 1 t 1 t 2 tn observe points must traverse the tower in a specified order thus for each 1 2 n we must have that t h 1 hence for each t ji ji p re pr in t topological speedups 19 0 therefore we have found our s t ji d 1 t ji d 1 of the form s x t p x x where p t ji d 1 z as desired continuing for each i and then for each column we see that we define p on all of a furthermore it is clear that t p is a continuous surjection from a onto its image in b as t p is a homeomorphism on each level of a to see that t p is injective hence a homeomorphism observe that t p is a homeomorphism when restricted to any a level in any column in the kakutani rokhlin tower partition moreover the t p image of any two distinct hence disjoint a levels is again disjoint finally as all columns of the kakutani rokhlin tower partition are disjoint t p maintains its injectivity and is therefore a homeomorphisms from a onto its image in b we now immediately use lemma 3 14 to prove the final lemma needed in order to prove our key lemma lemma 3 15 let x t be a minimal cantor system and let a b x be non empty disjoint clopen subsets of x with a b for every m x t moreover fix x a y b and let 0 be given then there exists clopen sets a 1 a b 1 b with the following properties 1 x a 1 and y b 1 2 diam a 1 diam b 1 3 for every m x t a 1 b 1 a 1 a 2 b 1 b 2 4 there exists p a a 1 z such that t p a a 1 b b 1 is a homeo morphism proof let a and b be non empty disjoint clopen subsets of x and fix x a and y b and let 0 be given recall that every measure m x t is full i e gives positive measure to non empty open sets whence 1 ad 0 let inf x 1 a d m x t since for every m x t a b we also have that inf x 1 b d m x t observe 1 a is continuous as a is clopen and since m x t is compact in the weak topology the above infimum is achieved whence 0 by lemma 3 12 there exists 0 and such that for every k b x and for every m x t diam k k 2 find clopen set a 1 3 a such that x a 1 3 and diam a 1 3 min let 1 inf x 1 a 1 3 d m x t 0 p re pr in t 20 drew d ash and use lemma 3 12 to obtain 1 0 such that for every k b x and for every m x t diam k 1 k 1 find clopen subset b 1 b such that y b 1 and diam b 1 min 1 thus we have for all m x t we have b 1 1 a 1 3 a a 1 3 b b 1 apply lemma 3 14 to t and get p 1 a a 1 3 z such that s a a 1 3 b b 1 defined by s x t p 1 x x is a homeomorphism onto its image then b s a a 1 3 b 1 u 1 where u 1 is a non empty clopen set and b 1 and u 1 are disjoint furthermore for every m x t we have that 2 a 1 3 b 1 u 1 we can visualize this as below a x a 1 3 b y b 1 u 1 s t p 1 a a 1 3 b s a a 1 3 here is the intertwining nature of the proof in order to extend to s to more of a we apply lemma 3 14 to t 1 with respect to the clopen sets u 1 and a 1 3 with a small neighborhood of x removed by 2 above we have for every m x t u 1 a 1 3 and let 2 inf x 1 a 1 3 1 u 1 d m x t 0 by lemma 3 12 there exists 2 0 such that for every m x t and every k b x we have diam k 2 k 2 find clopen set a 2 3 a 1 3 such that x a 2 3 and diam a 2 3 d 2 min 2 diam a 1 3 thus for all m x t we have that a 1 3 a 2 3 a 1 3 a 2 3 a 1 3 a 1 3 u 1 u 1 p re pr in t topological speedups 21 applying lemma 3 14 to t 1 and u 1 recall by proposition 3 4 we have m x t m x t 1 we get p 2 u 1 z such that t 1 p 2 u 1 a 1 3 a 2 3 is a homeo morphsim onto its image in a 1 3 a 2 3 x l 1 a 2 3 y b 1 a 1 3 u 1 t 1 p 2 we now use p 2 to define p 2 t 1 p 2 u 1 z by p 2 t 1 p 2 z z p 2 z observe for any z u 1 we have t p 2 z t p 2 z z z and similarly the reverse composition is the identity whence t p 2 is not only a bijection but the inverse function to t 1 p 2 and so is a homeomorphism itself this intertwining allows us to map more of a onto b using only positive powers of t and also to ensure that the diameter of b 1 is small as was the case with p 1 we see that a 1 3 t p 2 u 1 a 2 3 l 1 where l 1 is a clopen subset of a 1 3 with a 2 3 and l 1 being disjoint again we have the following equality for every m x t b 1 a 2 3 l 1 thus by defining a 1 a 2 3 l 1 we have a 1 and b 1 as desired we will use induction on our previous lemma to prove our key lemma lemma 3 16 let x t be a minimal cantor system and let a b be non empty disjoint clopen subsets of x if for all m x t a b then there exists p a z such that s a b defined as s x t p x x is a homeomorphism onto b proof let a and b be non empty disjoint clopen subsets of x and x a since t is minimal there exists n z such that t n x b let y t n x we will use induction to find a decreasing sequences of sets an n 0 and bn n 0 such that n 0 an x and n 0 bn y all while defining s on larger and larger parts ofa let 1 min diam a diam b 1 then using lemma 3 15 find clopen subsets a 1 and b 1 such that 1 x a 1 y b 1 2 diam a 1 1 diam b 1 1 3 for every m x t a 1 b 1 and a 1 a 2 b 1 b 2 p re pr in t 22 drew d ash 4 find p 1 a a 1 z such that s 1 t p 1 a a 1 b b 1 is a homeomorphism now having defined an an 1 and bn bn 1 with x an y bn and diam an n diam bn n where n min diam an 1 diam bn 1 1 n moreover we also have for all m x t an bn and an an 1 2 bn 1 bn 1 2 and pn an 1 an z such that sn an 1 an bn 1 bn is a homeomorphism use lemma 3 15 with n 1 min diam an diam bn 1 n 1 to find clopen sets an 1 and bn 1 such that 1 x an 1 y bn 1 2 diam an 1 n 1 diam bn 1 n 1 3 for every m x t an 1 bn 1 and an 1 an 2 bn 1 bn 2 4 find pn 1 an an 1 z such that sn 1 t pn 1 an an 1 bn bn 1 is a homeomorphism therefore by induction we have defined p a x by taking p x pn x where x an an 1 moreover we observe at this point t p a x b y is a homeomorphism we extend p to all of a by defining p x n consequently t p is a bijection on a all that is left to show is that t p is continuous on a by construction t p is continuous at all points in a less our exceptional point x let 0 be given then by the construction there exists an n such that bn b y thus t p an 1 bn as t p x x y hence taking 0 such that the ball of radius about x b x an 1 we have that t p is continuous at x whence is continuous on all of a therefore we have defined p in such a way that the map t p a b is a homeomorphism as desired an immediate corollary of this lemma in conjunction with proposition 3 5 is the following lemma lemma 3 17 let x t be a minimal cantor system and a b x clopen subsets such that a b if for all m x t a b then for any clopen p re pr in t topological speedups 23 partition of a say a n i 1 ai there exists clopen sets bi b with b n i 1 bi such that for all m x t and for each i we have ai bi we will use this lemma in the proof of the main theorem which is soon to follow we will make use of the following definition due to dahl definition 3 18 h dahl let k m x where x is a cantor set be a choquet simplex consisting of non atomic borel probability measures we say that k is a dynamical simplex d simplex if it satisfies the following two conditions 1 for clopen subsets a and b of x with a b for all k there exists a clopen subset b 1 b such that a b 1 for all k 2 if ek 6 then and are mutually singular it is well know that condition 2 is satisfied by everym x t for any continuous map on a compact metric space x furthermore thanks to glasner and weiss we have the following theorem theorem 3 19 gw 95 lemma 2 5 let x t be a minimal cantor system and m x t its associated choquet simplex of t invariant measures then m x t is a d simplex theorem 3 19 becomes useful in construction of the speedup which proves 3 1 we have enough background to finish the proof of the main theorem we recall the final portion of the main theorem we have left to prove we will show that theorem 3 20 given x 1 t 1 and x 2 t 2 minimal cantor system if there exists a homeomorphism f x 1 x 2 such that f m x 1 t 1 m x 2 t 2 is an injection then x 2 t 2 is a speedup of x 1 t 1 proof we begin with a sketch of the proof to keep in mind the idea of the construction is to take a refining sequence of kakutani rokhlin tower partitions in x 2 and copy them in x 1 using the homeomorphism f 1 we observe for any fixed tower in x 2 its copy in x 1 has the property that all levels in this tower have the same measure for every t 1 invariant measure now using lemma 3 16 we can define the speedup on all non final levels of the tower then we define a set conjugacy from one tower to another we simply iterate this process refining each previous tower we have a great deal of freedom in this construction enough to ensure the base and tops of the towers converge to prespecified singletons say x and t 11 x and that the sequence of towers generates the topology on x 1 we begin by fixing x 0 x 1 and let an n 0 be a nested sequence of clopen sets where n 0 an x 0 for each n let zn t 1 1 an and so n 0 zn t 1 1 x 0 we may assume with no loss of generality that a 0 z 0 moreover observe for every m x 1 t 1 and every n an zn that being said let 0 be defined below 0 min x 1 a 0 d m x 1 t 1 p re pr in t 24 drew d ash coupling the fact that m x 1 t 1 is compact in the weak topology and both a 0 is clopen we may conclude 0 0 let 0 0 apply theorem 2 4 to create q n n 0 a sequence of kakutani rohklin tower partitions of x 2 specifically q n t j 2 bi n 1 i t n 0 j hi n where t n represents the total number of columns and hi n represents the height of the ith column in the nth kakutani rokhlin tower partition of x 2 furthermore q n n 0 has the following three properties 1 n n 1 i t n bi n y 2 for every n we have q n 1 is finer than q n 3 n n q n generates the topology of x 2 let p n n 0 be a sequence of finite clopen partitions which generates the topol ogy on x use lemma 3 12 with respect to 0 and obtain a 0 0 such that for everyk b x 2 with diam k 0 we have for every m x 2 t 2 k 0 since n 0 1 i t n bi n y there exists an n 0 such that diam 1 i t n 0 bi n 0 0 thus for every m x 2 t 2 we have that 1 i t n 0 bi n 0 0 below we give a picture of x 2 t 2 partitioned into q n 0 we will use f 1 to copy this tower partition into x 1 p re pr in t topological speedups 25 b 1 n 0 t 2 b 2 n 0 t 2 t 2 bt n 0 n 0 t 2 t 2 t 2 t 2 define for 1 i t n 0 and 0 j hi n 0 c i j f 1 t j 2 bi n 0 we will make a series of alterations to each c i j resulting in c i j with c i j c i j for all m x 1 t 1 furthermore this will be done iteratively and once com pleted we will have the following x t n 0 i 1 c i 0 a 0 and t 1 1 x t n 0 i 1 c i hi n 0 1 z 0 first ensure c i 0 a 0 for each i recall that for every m x 1 t 1 t n 0 i 1 c i 0 t n 0 i 1 c i 0 t n 0 i 1 f 1 bi n 0 t n 0 i 1 bi n 0 0 a 0 in particular for every m x 1 t 1 3 a 0 t n 0 i 1 c i 0 0 define d 0 i c i 0 a 0 and d 0 i c i 0 ac 0 and by the above we have for every m x 1 t 1 4 t n 0 i 1 d 0 i a 0 t n 0 i 1 d 0 i p re pr in t 26 drew d ash fix i 1 it may be the case that d 0 1 6 and in this case we wish to amend this and to do it in a way which preserves all the measures of each clopen set c i j we know from 4 above that for m x 1 t 1 d 0 1 a 0 t n 0 i 1 d 0 i thus as m x 1 t 1 is a d simplex there exists c 1 a 0 t n 0 i 1 d 0 i clopen such that for every m x 1 t 1 c 1 d 0 1 note c 1 is partitioned by t n 0 i 1 hi n 0 1 j 0 c i j into c 1 m k 1 cik jk 1 where cik jk 1 c ik jk hence by lemma 3 17 there exists a partition of d 0 1 d 0 1 m k 1 dik jk 1 where for all m x 1 t 1 and each k 1 2 m cik jk 1 dik jk 1 define c 1 0 d 0 1 c 1 and for each k 1 2 m c ik jk c ik jk cik jk 1 dik jk 1 observe for every m x 1 t 1 and k 1 2 m we have c 1 0 c 1 0 c ik jk c ik jk and of course all the measure of the unaffected c i j still have the same measure for each m x 1 t 1 combining 3 and 4 from above reveals t n 0 i 2 d 0 i a 0 t n 0 i 2 d 0 i c 1 0 we now simply repeat the above argument inequalities 3 and 4 allow us to do this construction for each i 1 2 t n 0 defining c i 0 for i 1 2 t n 0 furthermore by construction we have the following two properties 1 for every m x 1 t 1 and every i c i 0 c i 0 2 for every i 6 j c i 0 c j 0 second ensure x t n 0 i 1 c i 0 p re pr in t topological speedups 27 in all of the adjusting to construct c i 0 i 1 2 t n 0 we may not have captured x if not then x a 0 n 0 i 1 c i 0 use proposition 3 12 and find a small enough clopen subset of a 0 n 0 i 1 c i 0 containing x and exchange it with part of c 1 0 third repeat steps one and two to obtain c i hi n 0 1 i 1 2 t n 0 notice that 0 min 0 0 so we can repeat the above two steps using the same sort of calculations and construction to obtain clopen sets c i hi n 0 1 i 1 2 t n 0 such that t 11 x t n 0 i 1 c i hi n 0 1 z 0 furthermore for every m x 1 t 1 c i hi n 0 1 c i hi n 0 1 having defined c i 0 and c i hi n 0 1 for i 1 2 m we wish to keep consistent notation and thus rename any c i j to simply c i j whence we have the following x t n 0 i 1 c i 0 a 0 t 11 x t n 0 i 1 c i hi n 0 1 z 0 for every m x 1 t 1 and fixed i 1 2 t n 0 we have c i 0 c i 1 c i hi n 0 1 now we use repeated applications of our key lemma lemma 3 16 to define our speedup on nearly all of x 1 specifically s c i j c i j 1 for each 1 i t n 0 and 0 j hi n 0 1 thus s is defined on x 1 t n 0 i 1 c i hi n 0 1 c 1 0 s c 1 1 c 1 h 1 n 0 1 c 2 0 s c 2 1 c 2 h 2 n 0 2 s c 2 h 2 n 0 1 c t n 0 0 s c t n 0 1 c t n 0 ht n 0 n 0 3 s c t n 0 ht n 0 n 0 2 s c t n 0 ht n 0 n 0 1 p re pr in t 28 drew d ash formally let p 0 sj c i 0 1 i t n 0 0 j hi n 0 where sj c i 0 c i j refine p 0 with respect to each clopen set in p as in proposition 2 3 thus preserving the tower structure and call the result p 0 so x 1 now looks like e 1 0 s em 0 s em 1 0 s s en 0 s s ep 0 s s s et n 0 0 s s s where for each i c i 0 ki 1 1 j ki ej 0 and p 0 s jei 0 1 i t n 0 0 j h i n 0 where t n 0 is the new number of base levels and h i n 0 gives the height of the respective column because c i 0 c i 0 for all m x 1 t 1 f x 1 x 2 is a homeomorphism and through the use of lemma 3 17 we can refine q n 0 our tower partition in x 2 to look exactly like p 0 that is there are sets b j 0 such that f 1 b j 0 ej 0 and bi n 0 ki 1 1 ki b 0 and set q n 0 t j 2 b 0 1 t n 0 0 j h i n 0 hence x 2 looks like b 1 0 t 2 b m 0 t 2 b m 1 0 t 2 t 2 b n 0 t 2 t 2 b q 0 t 2 t 2 t 2 b t n 0 0 t 2 t 2 t 2 p re pr in t topological speedups 29 and we define a map on the level of sets which in the limit will give us our conjugacy define 0 p 0 q n 0 by 0 s j ei 0 t j 2 b i 0 we have now completed the first step of our construction inductive step we now move onto the second inductive step of our construction let 1 min 1 0 where 1 min x 1 a 1 d m x 1 t 1 0 0 min 1 i t n 0 x 1 ei 0 d m x 1 t 1 0 and find n 1 n 0 large enough such that the following are true 1 for every m x 2 t 2 t n 1 i 1 bi n 1 1 2 q n 1 refines q n 0 i e q n 1 q n 0 now as q n 1 q n 0 we see that each column in q n 1 is simply made up of stacking towers from q n 0 upon one another so we view q n 1 not only as a space time partition but also as a labeled or tagged partition by the previous tower construction in this case tagged by the towers of q n 0 we give a picture as an illustrative example of the tagging or labeling of the towers 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 2 1 9 6 2 1 2 1 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 p re pr in t 30 drew d ash as a consequence of q n 1 q n 0 we see that for 1 i t n 0 and 0 j h i n 0 we have t j 2 b i 0 m a 1 t ja 2 bia n 1 and thus we have that f 1 t j 2 b i 0 m a 1 f 1 t ja 2 bia n 1 as a result of lemma 3 17 we can write sj ei 0 m a 1 e i a 1 using lemma 3 17 on each copied tower of x 2 in x 1 we can copy q n 1 in x 1 in a way which refines our p 0 call this collection p 1 recall we have already defined s on a large portion of x 1 and we do not need nor want to be redefining s on this portion of the space following the tagging from q n 1 extend s on any and all previous undefined pieces save for the top levels of each column as before using proposition 2 3 refine p 1 with respect to each clopen set in p 1 and call p 1 the result of this refinement specfically p 1 sj ei 1 1 i t n 1 0 j h i n 1 use lemma 3 17 and f to push this refinement onto q n 1 resulting in q n 1 t j 2 b i 1 1 i t n 1 0 j h i n 1 as before we define 1 p 1 q n 1 by 1 s j ei 1 t j 2 b i 1 and by construction 1 extends 0 we continue this process and thus by induction we see that we will have defined s x 1 t 1 1 x x 1 x by construction s is a homeomorphism and so by defining p t 11 x 1 we see that s now lifts to a homeomorphism on all of x furthermore n n 0 induces by way of intersec tion a point map x 1 x 2 which is our conjugacy from x 1 s onto x 2 t 2 the fact is well defined and a homeomorphism is due to both p k k 0 and q nk k 0 being generating for the topology of x 1 and x 2 respectively more over conjugates s and t 2 is built into the definition of each n and each n 1 extends the previous n therefore our theorem as been proved 4 speedup equivalence we wish to view speedups as a relation and to that end it will be helpful to introduce some notation let xi ti i 1 2 be minimal cantor systems and write t 1 t 2 to mean that x 2 t 2 is a speedup of x 1 t 1 moreover define x 1 t 1 and x 2 t 2 to be speedup equivalent written t 1 t 2 if and only if t 1 t 2 and t 2 t 1 it is straight forward to verify that speedup equivalence is indeed an equivalence relation combining gps 95 thm 2 2 with our main theorem we obtain the following corollary corollary 4 1 let x 1 t 1 and x 2 t 2 be minimal cantor systems if x 1 t 1 and x 2 t 2 are orbit equivalent then x 1 t 1 and x 2 t 2 are speedup equivalent i e t 1 t 2 p re pr in t topological speedups 31 rephrasing corollary 4 1 above as equivalence relations orbit equivalence is contained in speedup equivalence this leads us to a fundamental question are orbit equivalence and speedup equivalence the same equivalence relation at his time we only have the partial answer in the form of the theorem 4 3 however before we can prove the aforementioned theorem we need a proposition for which the proof is straight forward and hence omitted proposition 4 2 let xi ti be minimal cantor systems and x 1 x 2 be a homeomorphism if m x 1 t 1 m x 2 t 2 is an injection then preserves pairs of mutually singular measures we now use proposition 4 2 to prove the following theorem theorem 4 3 let xi ti i 1 2 be minimal cantor systems each with finitely many ergodic measures if x 1 t 1 and x 2 t 2 are speedup equivalent then x 1 t 1 and x 2 t 2 are orbit equivalent proof since t 1 t 2 combining part 3 of theorem 3 6 and proposition 4 2 it follows immediately that e m x 1 t 1 e m x 2 t 2 and without loss of generality we may assume e m x 1 t 1 n for some n z every measure in m x 2 t 2 is a convex combination of ergodic measures in a unique way with this in mind for m x 2 t 2 let e denote the collection of all ergodic measures of m x 2 t 2 which have a positive coefficient in the unique ergodic decomposition of observe if 1 2 m x 2 t 2 with 1 6 2 and 1 2 then e 1 e 2 now as t 1 t 2 there exists x 1 x 2 a homeomorphism such that m x 1 t 1 m x 2 t 2 is an injection since e m x 1 t 1 e m x 2 t 2 n and is injective we see that e i n i 1 where i n i 1 e m x 1 t 1 is a collection of n pairwise disjoint sets as distinct ergodic measures are mutually singular it follows that for each i 1 2 n e i is a distinct singleton and therefore e m x 1 t 1 e m x 2 t 2 coupling the facts that is an affine map and a bijection on extreme points we may conclude that is a bijection and hence is an affine homeomorphism between m x 1 t 1 and m x 2 t 2 arising from a space homeomorphism therefore by gps 95 thm 2 2 x 1 t 1 and x 2 t 2 are orbit equivalent there are two obstacles which arise when trying to extend theorem 4 3 to the infinite dimensional case the first is whether or not it is always true that e m x 1 t 2 e m x 2 t 2 whenever t 1 t 2 the second is whether the schro der bernstein theorem holds in the category of simple dimension groups with our morphisms the schro der bernstein theorem for dimension groups and simple dimension groups was ad dressed in the glasner and weiss paper gw 95 which we discuss below we must remark that speedup equivalence looks quite similar to weak orbit equivalence especially in terms of weakly isomorphic dimension groups observe that we have surjective homomorphisms and the key difference is that we require p re pr in t 32 drew d ash our homomorphism to exhaust the positive cone in the image space we mention this here because one avenue to try to answer the speedup equivalence question would be to show that given two dimension groups g 1 g 1 1 and g 2 g 2 1 with surjective group homomorphisms 1 2 satisfying 1 g 1 g 2 and 1 g 1 g 2 1 1 1 2 g 2 g 1 and 2 g 2 g 1 2 1 1 then in fact g 1 g 1 1 g 2 g 2 1 however glasner and weiss in gw 95 gave a beautiful counter example example 4 2 which shows that even if inf g 0 the schro eder bernstein theorem fails for simple dimension groups unfortunately their example fails to exhaust the positive cone since this cannot happen with speedups this example would need some modification to apply 5 example we will now use the main theorem theorem 3 6 to show the aforementioned claim speedups can leave the conjugacy class and even the orbit equivalence class of the original system this will be demonstrated by showing that the simplex of invariant borel probability measure can grow see proposition 3 5 to do so we will use theorem 3 6 in conjunction with theorem 2 14 which recall says that states and invariant measures are in bijective correspondence let x t be the dyadic odometer it is well known that the dimension group associated to this system is z 1 2 z 1 2 1 since x t is uniquely ergodic by proposition 2 14 it follows that z 1 2 z 1 2 1 has only one state our goal is to construct a simple dimension group with two states such that it factors onto z 1 2 z 1 2 1 in the sense of the main theorem one can show that the following is a dimension group z 1 2 z 1 2 z 1 2 z 1 2 0 0 1 1 where z 1 2 x z 1 2 x 0 note the riesz interpolation property is satisfied as z 1 2 is a totally ordered set to see that z 1 2 z 1 2 z 1 2 z 1 2 0 0 1 1 is a simple dimension group we use the following lemma from g lemma 5 1 g lemma 14 1 let g be a nonzero directed abelian group then g is simple if and only if every nonzero element of g is an order unit in g an ordered group g is directed if all elements of g have the form x y for some x y g and so any dimension group is directed one can use lemma 5 1 to show that z 1 2 z 1 2 z 1 2 z 1 2 0 0 1 1 is indeed a simple dimension group now by theorem 2 13 there exists minimal cantor system x 2 t 2 such that k 0 x 2 t 2 k 0 x 2 t 2 1 z 12 z 1 2 z 1 2 z 1 2 0 0 1 1 in addition one can verify that 1 z 1 2 z 1 2 z 1 2 z 1 2 0 0 1 1 z 1 2 z 1 2 1 satisfies condition 2 of the main theorem theorem 3 6 whence x 2 t 2 is a speedup of x t the dyadic odometer p re pr in t topological speedups 33 we will now show x 2 t 2 and x t are not conjugate to one another hence speedups can leave their conjugacy classes furthermore we will actually show that x 2 t 2 and x t cannot even be orbit equivalent to see this it suf fices to show by gps 95 theorem 2 2 that their respective dimension groups modulo infinitesimals are not isomorphic as dimension groups to accomplish this we will use states and show z 1 2 z 1 2 z 1 2 z 1 2 0 0 1 1 and z 1 2 z 1 2 1 have different state spaces recall all states can be realized as integration against invariant probability measures hence as x t is uniquely er godic it has exactly one state namely the identity map thus it suffices to show that x 2 t 2 has more than one invariant measure or more to the point that z 1 2 z 1 2 z 1 2 z 1 2 0 0 1 1 has more than one state before we begin we must deal with one technical aspect that is we know that k 0 x 2 t 2 k 0 x 2 t 2 1 is isomorphic as a dimension group to z 1 2 z 1 2 z 1 2 z 1 2 0 0 1 1 so we must show that this group has only trivial infinitesimals recall infinitesimals evaluate to 0 for every state on the di mension group and i z 1 2 z 1 2 z 1 2 z 1 2 0 0 1 1 r i 1 2 are states from this we can deduce that the only infinitesimal of z 1 2 z 1 2 z 1 2 z 1 2 0 0 1 1 is 0 0 hence k 0 x 2 t 2 inf k 0 x 2 t 2 k 0 x 2 t 2 inf k 0 x 2 t 2 1 z 1 2 z 1 2 z 1 2 z 1 2 0 0 1 1 as dimension groups furthermore as 1 6 2 on z 1 2 z 1 2 z 1 2 z 1 2 0 0 1 1 we have z 1 2 z 1 2 1 z 1 2 z 1 2 z 1 2 z 1 2 0 0 1 1 and so x t and x 2 t 2 are not orbit equivalent hence not conjugate
