gautam gangopadhyay deb shankar ray april 3 2019 abstract we have presented an unified scheme to express a class of system of equations in two variables into a lie nard levinson smith lls oscillator form we have derived the condition for limit cycle with special reference to rayleigh and lie nard systems for arbitrary polynomial functions of damping and restoring force krylov boguliubov k b method is implemented to determine the maximum number of limit cycles admissible for a lls oscillator atleast in the weak damping limit scheme is illustrated by a number of model systems with single cycle as well as the multiple cycle cases 1 introduction various open kinetic systems 1 2 3 4 5 6 in physics chemistry and biology are generically described by a minimal model of autonomous coupled differential equations 7 8 9 10 11 12 of two variables they exhibit self sustained oscillation in the form of stable limit cycle in a phase plane in many examples such as chemical reactions 3 13 14 biological rhythms 2 1 15 16 17 4 vibrations in mechanical 18 optical system and musical instrument 4 19 to name a few a rayleigh 19 equation in violin string and van der pol oscillation in electric circuit are the classic examples in this context more generally lie nard 20 14 4 21 22 23 equation underlines the concrete criteria for the existence of at least one limit cycle for a general class of such systems of which van der pol is a special case of the form x f x x x 0 where f x x 2 1 and lie nard transformation is x y f x and y x with f x x 0 f d a further generalisation of lie nard equation is the lls equation 21 22 23 6 x f x x x g x 0 sometimes called the generalised lie nard equation casting a general system of kinetic equations in two variables which describe a variety of scenarios in physical chemical bio chemical and ecological sciences into lls form 6 is often not straight forward 6 14 24 4 to this end we have provided a scheme for a wide class of open nonlinear equations cast in the lls form so that the later becomes amenable to several techniques in nonlinear dynamics our next objective is to find the nature and the number of limit cycles for a given lls equation thereby addressing the second part of the hilbert s 16 th problem the problem of counting limit cycle has a long legacy since hilbert smale and many others and still continues it without complete understanding 9 10 25 20 26 27 28 29 our scheme is based on the kb method of averaging 30 4 7 12 a variant of multi scale perturbation technique 4 31 32 33 to derive amplitude equation with considering the polynomial forms of the nonlinear damping and restoring force functions we have illustrated our results on a variety of known model systems 20 26 34 with single and multiple limit

dimensional autonomous kinetic equations for an open system our aim is to cast the equations into a form of a variant of lls oscillator 4 14 24 or lls oscillator 4 14 24 12 6 which can further be reduced to rayleigh and lie nard form let us begin with the system of autonomous kinetic equations dx dt a 0 a 1 x a 2 y f x y dy dt b 0 b 1 x b 2 y g x y 1 where x t and y t are for example field variables or populations of species of chemical biological or ecological process 4 5 2 1 with ai bi for i 0 1 2 are all real parameters expressed in terms of the appropriate kinetic constants let xs ys be the fixed point of the system and f x y and g x y are the non linear functions of x and y a first step is shifting the steady state xs ys to the origin 0 0 with the help of a linear transformation as lls system is a second order homogeneous ordinary differential equation the linear transformation can be chosen by introducing a new pair of variables u both of which are functions of x and y where 0 1 x 2 y with 0 1 xs 2 ys i e 1 x xs 2 y ys such that u 1 2 are weighted constants such that it makes the new steady state at the origin s 0 us 0 u is expressed as u 0 1 x 2 y with i i for i 0 1 2 are all real constants which can be expressed in terms of system parameters from the inverse transformation we can easily obtain the expressions for x and y as given by x 2 0 2 u 0 1 2 2 1 l u y 1 0 1 0 u 1 2 2 1 k u 2 provided that 1 2 2 1 6 0 differentiating again u with respect to the independent variable t we get u 1 x 2 y 1 a 0 a 1 l a 2 k 2 b 0 b 1 l b 2 k 3 where l c 1 c 2 cl and k c 3 c 4 ck with c 1 c 2 cl c 3 c 4 ck 1 1 2 2 1 2 2 2 0 0 2 1 1 0 1 1 0 the functions and can be expressed as a power series expansion as n m 0 nm n m and n m 0 nm n m 4 with as the functions f and g are related through by g f r so after putting the above form in equation 3 one can find 1 a 0 1 a 1 c 1 c 2 cl 1 a 2 c 3 c 4 ck 1 2 n m 0 nm n m 2 b 0 2 b 1 c 1 c 2 cl 2 b 2 c 3 c 4 ck i e a 00 a 10 n 1 an 0 n 1 a 01 n 0 an 1 n n 0 m 1 anm n m 1 5 where 1 a 0 2 b 0 1 2 00 1 a 1 2 b 1 cl 1 a 2 2 b 2 ck a 00 0 by definition of a zero fixed point of a 10 1 a 1 c 1 a 2 c 3 2 b 1 c 1 b 2 c 3 1 2

f g 0 6 where the functions f and g are given by f a 01 n 0 an 1 n n 0 m 1 anm n m 1 g a 10 n 1 an 0 n 1 7 equation 6 is a well known equation of generalised lie nard form called lls equation the condition for existence of having at least a locally stable limit cycle of the dynamical system is f 0 0 0 a 01 0 it can be shown from the linear stability analysis that there is a relation between f 0 0 and eigenvalues with f 0 0 2 re for a lls system there are six conditions to have a limit cycle are given in 22 23 6 14 out of these six conditions the condition f 0 0 plays an important role to have a locally stable or unstable limit cycle for such kind of system 14 24 12 6 depending upon the sign of f 0 0 is 0 or 0 respectively in particular two situations may arise i for anm 0 with n 2 m i e there be an unique steady state s 0 with restoring force linear in then the above form of 6 looks like fr gr 0 8 where fr a 01 m 1 a 0 m m 1 gr a 10 m 0 a 1 m m 9 which is in the form of generalised rayleigh oscillator 19 the limit cycle condition modifies to fr 0 0 ii for anm 0 with m 2 n which corresponds to lie nard equation with an unique steady state s 0 this is of the form fl gl 0 10 where fl a 01 n 0 an 1 n gl a 10 n 1 an 0 n 1 11 where the limit cycle condition is fl 0 0 we know that for a lie nard system the damping force function fl and the restoring force function gl are even and odd functions of respectively however for generalised lie nard or lls system the odd even properties ofg and f have complex ramifications 6 for practical systems here we have examined the properties with the help of krylov boguliubov averaging method 3 maximum number of limit cycles we now restrict ourselves to the case of lls systems where the f and g are the polynomial functions of and it is well known that linear functional forms of f and g preclude the existence of limit cycle this can be readily seen by considering the typical examples e g a harmonic oscillator or a weakly nonlinear oscillator with a potential 1 2 20 x 2 1 3 x 4 0 1 or a lotka volterra model where one encounters a center we therefore consider the polynomial form of nonlinear damping function f and restoring force function g for our analysis of limit cycle in what follows we employ k b method of averaging to show that the characteristic even odd powers of polynomials play crucial role in determining the behaviour of the associated amplitude and phase equations to begin with we consider some fixed values of m n of equation 7 to truncate the series at m n for the highest power of and respectively for explicit structure of a prototypical example of an amplitude equation we choose upto 4 m n 3 for illustration this includes all possible cases for the even and odd nature of f and g respectively then the above form of f and g will be in the following reduced forms f a 01 a 11 a 21 2 a 31 3 a 02 a 12 a 22 2 a 32 3 a 03 2 a 13 2 a 23 2 2 a 33 3 2 g a 10 a 20 2 a 30 3 12 let us take f 0 0 r an arbitrary constant with f f then the lls equation can be rewritten as f g 0 13 therefore the final equation takes the form of a non linear oscillator after rescaling t by taking t as z h z z z 0 14 where 0 2 1 2 a 10 0 and z t and z t equation 14 is now ready for the treatment using k b method with 15 h z z b 01 b 11 z b 21 z 2 b 31 z 3 b 02 z b 12 z z b 22 z 2 z b 32 z 3 z b 03 2 z 2 b 13 z 2 z 2 b 23 z 2 2 z 2 b 33 z 3 2 z 2 z b 20 z 2 b 30 z 3 where bij aij i j 0 1 2 3 with b 00 0 and b 01 will take the fixed value 1 0 or 1 depending upon the nature of the fixed point is stable focus center center type or limit cycle respectively now choosing z r cos as a solution of eq 14 we have z r sin with slowly varying radius r z 2 z 2 and phase tan 1 z z the function h z z contains all the non linear terms and is the non linearity controlling parameter i e one has to satisfy 0 2 then one can obtain r h sin and h r cos i e the time derivative of amplitude and phase are of o so after taking a running average 4 6 7 of a time dependent function u defined as u 1 2 2 0 u s ds one finds r h sin and hr cos which gives r r 16 r 2 b 23 r 2 2 6 b 03 2 2 b 21 8 b 01 o 2 r 2 16 b 32 r 2 2 2 b 12 2 6 b 30 o 2 16 now from a close look at the equation for r it is apparent that only even elements of f appears but none of any elements of g is present due to the zero averages of sin cos terms with 1 and z the non zero averages arise only when both are even i e 2 1 2 2 1 2 z thus the effect in r appears only through the even coefficients of f i e by examining the respective variables in the r equation we find that only some even coefficients appear for the first order correction on the other hand contains only even coefficients of f which are not in amplitude equation along with odd coefficients of g which shows that only odd g plays a role here so from the equation of r one finds that there exist at most 4 non zero values of r if out of the four roots every pair appears as conjugate then there are three possibilities the cases are i two different sets of complex conjugate roots giving an asymptotically stable solution ii one pair of complex conjugate roots and two real roots of equal magnitude with opposite sign implying a limit cycle solution having only one cycle and iii either four real roots of equal magnitude with opposite sign having double multiplicity gives a limit cycle solution with only one cycle or two different sets of real roots of equal magnitude with opposite sign may give limit cycle solution with two different cycles of different radius the unique zero values of the roots of r gives a center or center type 35 situation so in short the existence of a nonzero real root will provide the radius of the cycle which will be stable or unstable depending on the ve or ve sign of dr dr at r rss and at rss 0 dr dr 0 or 0 gives the nature of the fixed point as an example for kaiser model 15 16 36 37 38 39 17 40 there exist three limit cycles for a certain range of so if we choose the parameters and from the three limit cycle zone then there exist six real roots with three 5 different pairs i e three different radii exist according to three cycles but slightly away from the three limit cycle zone there will exist only a pair of real roots with the same magnitude and other four will appear as a complex conjugate pairs and together produces only a stable limit cycle note that to have a stable limit cycle solution one condition must be satisfied i e f 0 0 0 but it fails to give how many limit cycles the system can admit according to the root finding algorithm one can guess the maximum number of cycles of a lls system the condition f 0 0 0 plays an important role as a check for the existence of atleast one stable limit cycle but for 2 cycle situations one can have at first the locally unstable limit cycle before locating the outer stable limit cycle and in this situation f 0 0 0 based on these considerations we have prepared a table table i illustrating the possible cases for the maximum number of non zero real roots or the limit cycles table i maxumum number of limit cycles for lls system n m n m max no of non zero max no of real roots even cycle s even even even n m 2 n 1 m 1 n m 2 1 even odd odd n m 1 n m 1 n m 1 2 odd even odd n m 3 n 2 m 1 n m 3 2 odd odd even n m 2 n 1 m 1 n m 2 1 now if we denote the non zero real values of r as an existence of limit cycles as r gives the radius of the cycle where at the same time a pair of conjugate one ve and one ve roots of equal magnitude exists for such kind of lls systems then out of these two roots radius will be measured by the magnitude and each distinct magnitude counts the number of cycles for example if there exists six roots say p p occurring twice and q q occurring once then the number of cycles will be 2 of radius p and q respectively so if there are all real roots occurring once then the number of cycles will be atmost n m 2 2 or n m 1 2 or n m 3 2 for lls equation with n m are the maximum power of and respectively we have performed the k b analysis numerically for n 10 m 10 the result is given in table ii for rayleigh system with n 1 for all m 1 maximum number of limit cycle will be m 1 2 or m 2 2 for odd or even m respectively for lie nard system with m 1 for all n 1 the maximum number of limit cycle becomes n 1 2 or n 2 for odd or even n respectively the above table is valid for an arbitrary finite polynomials of f and g for the case of arbitrary infinite polynomial 27 28 29 cases maximum number of limit cycles can be stated for finite truncation 4 applications to some model systems here we have examined three classes of physical models where the analysis of the maximum number of limit cycles holds this connection with the general model system is discussed with polynomial damping and restoring force function 4 1 one cycle cases van der pol oscillator simple glycolytic oscillator modified brusselator model considering the van der pol oscillator 4 24 7 15 3 2 41 with equation x x 2 1 x x 0 having the weak nonlinearity for 0 1 produces a locally stable limit cycle with f 0 0 0 so if we compare with the general table we have n 2 and m 1 this gives a condition for a unique stable limit cycle next considering the lie nard form 24 35 of simple glycolytic oscillator 4 24 35 3 2 5 as 1 a 3 b 2 2 b 2 bk 3 b k 2 a b 2 0 a b 0 k b b a b 2 has a unique stable limit cycle with f 0 0 0 24 having n 1 and m 3 this gives one limit cycle 6 furthermore considering the modified brusselator model having the lie nard form 14 24 5 2 a 1 b a 21 2 2 a 1 2 b a 1 2 2 a 21 0 a 1 b 0 gives a unique stable limit cycle with f 0 0 0 14 24 where n 1 and m 3 again giving rise to the same situation 4 2 two cycle cases we rewrite the lie nard form according to ref 20 34 as x t y t f x t y t x t where f x t is an odd polynomial after taking derivative it takes the following form x f x x x 0 where f x f x x now becomes the form of an even polynomial for f x a 1 x a 2 x 2 a 3 x 3 it has been shown 20 34 42 that the system allows a unique limit cycle if a 1 a 3 0 which will be stable if a 1 0 and unstable if a 1 0 this corresponds to the table n 2 m 1 further extension by rychkov 43 shows that for f x a 1 x a 3 x 3 a 5 x 5 the number of limit cycle is atmost two numerical simulation corroborates this observation when f x is chosen as in ref 20 34 42 f x 0 32 x 5 4 3 x 3 0 8 x for this case the inner one is unstable limit cycle as f 0 0 0 8 0 i e a stable fixed point but the outer one is a stable limit cycle here as per table i we have n 4 and m 1 the above table thus gives the strategies to find out the number of limit cycles both stable and unstable a system can have on the other hand our analysis by k b method provides a hint towards a choice of the parameter space for search of real roots of the radial equation 4 3 three cycles case kaiser bi rythmicity model extending van der pol oscillator model with a nonlinear function of higher order polynomial kaiser 15 16 36 37 38 39 17 40 has described bi rythmicity with the nonlinear equation x 1 x 2 x 4 x 6 x x e cos t 17 here 0 tune the non linearity this is a prototype self sustained oscillatory system in absence of e and which are the amplitude and the frequency of the external excitation respectively the model exhibits an extremely rich bifurcation behaviour and the system actually produces bi rhythmicity it has been emphasized that in the undriven case the model is a multi limit cycle oscillator and has three limit cycles two of them are stable and between the two stable limit cycles there is an unstable one which divides the basins of attraction of the two stable cycles in presence of e and the above system exhibits some interesting features 15 16 36 37 38 39 40 from table i one has n 6 and m 1 with even odd sub cases while e 0 thus there may have 6 roots for the radial equation if 0 and controlling parameters of the radii are chosen from three limit cycle zone 0 144 0 005 and finally the number of distinct values will be 3 which implies that the system can have atmost three limit cycles but here it is exactly 3 further if we choose 0 for the above undriven kaiser model with 0 1 one can have two limit cycles with radii 2 35 and 3 80 respectively of which the smaller one will be stable and the larger one will be unstable note that if there are odd number of limit cycles say l then out of the l cycles l 1 2 will be stable limit cycles and the remaining l 1 2 will be unstable limit cycles for example for the van der pol oscillator glycolytic oscillator modified brusselator model etc only one limit cycle exists which is stable for kaiser model l 3 and one can observe the situations accordingly so for odd number of cycles innermost one will be locally stable 4 4 k cycle cases 4 4 1 a model with n 1 and m 2 k 1 for counting the number of limit cycles gaiko 26 has shown for a lie nard type system i e lls equation having the form x 1 2 x 3 x 2 2 kx 2 k 1 2 k 1 x 2 k x x 0 18 7 can have atmost k limit cycles if and only if 1 0 the result 26 correlates with our result for any value of k z it fits the odd odd case of the general table and accordingly m and n are 2 k 1 and 1 respectively and finally the number of cycles will be atmost n m 2 1 k 4 4 2 a model with n 2 k and m 1 blows and lloyd 44 20 have stated that for the lie nard or lls system x y f x y g x with g x x and f x a 1 x a 2 x 2 a 2 k 1 x 2 k 1 has at most k local limit cycles and there are coefficients with a 1 a 3 a 2 k 1 altering in sign this can be found from the table i with n 2 k and m 1 to give the condition of atmost k limit cycles for example taking k 3 with f x 72 x 392 3 x 3 224 5 x 5 128 35 x 7 has exactly three limit cycles for sufficiently small 6 0 which are circles with radii 1 2 and 3 the above statement nicely corresponds to the theorem 6 pp 260 20 table ii table for highest degree polynomial n m for lls system together with maximum number of distinct conjugate roots r with 1 n m 10 r m 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1 2 0 3 0 4 2 5 2 6 4 7 4 8 6 9 6 10 8 11 8 2 3 2 4 2 5 4 6 4 7 6 8 6 9

16 10 11 10 12 10 13 12 14 12 15 14 16 14 17 16 18 16 19 18 20 18 counting the number of limit cycles through rg method in first order will give similar result which was done by das et al 27 28 29 for some models we have verified similar results for 3 3 polynomial cases for f g functions using rg method which become increasingly very difficult and almost impossible upto 10 10 case than k b averaging method as tabulated in this work it is very useful to count the number of limit cycles from the table by just looking at the lls form for example the number of limit cycles of all models in ref 27 28 29 along with the models in our work can be estimated from our table the table i can also be utilized to prepare a model of a desired number of limit cycles in a systematic way 5 conclusions we have presented a scheme to cast a set of a class of coupled nonlinear equations in two variables into a lls form by expressing the nonlinear damping and forcing functions as polynomial we have implemented k b method of averaging to explore the number of admissible limit cycles of the dynamical systems our results can be summarised as follows 1 for a lls system the number of limit cycles will be atmost n m 2 2 when n and m degree of the polynomials for damping and restoring force both are even or odd again n m 1 2 cycles can be found when n is even and m is odd and finally n m 3 2 cycles when n is odd and m is even 2 for a lie nard system in particular the formula of counting the number of limit cycles follows the same with m 1 and n z also for the generalised rayleigh situation there occurs a linear restoring force so that n is 1 and m z 3 we have validated our general result with the help of a variety of physical systems with one two three upto arbitrary k cycles 4 this method stated in our work can also be utilized to prepare a model of a desired number of limit cycles in a systematic way 8 acknowledgement sandip saha acknowledges rgnf ugc india for the
