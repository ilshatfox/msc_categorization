by interval as a corollary for almost all interval exchange transformations rank one transformations are dense g in the weak closure keywords rank one interval exchange transformations rauzy veech induction 2000 mr subject classification 37 a 30 in this paper we extend veech s theorem about rank one interval exchange transformations i e t 4 11 to all positive integer powers of interval exchange transformations totally rank one property of rank one is a crucial conception in the field of ergodic theory and dynamic systems originated from stacking construction of transformations related to symbolic dynamics rank one transformation has been studied with regarding to many topics 2 3 5 including functional spectrum invariant measures of productions and many other topics if the base of each rohlin tower of the rank one transformation is an interval we say it is rank one by interval if all the powers of a transformation are rank one we say it is totally rank one definition 0 1 here it is showed that measure theoretically all the interval exchange transformations are totally rank one by interval theorem 1 3 definition 0 1 totally rank one we say a finite measure preserving system x t is totally rank one if for every q n t q is rank one in section one we introduce the fundamental concepts of i e t rauzy veech induction 7 8 9 and veech s theorems 9 about i e t s related to this paper at the end of section one the main theorem of this paper is stated almost all interval exchange transformations are totally rank one by interval in section 2 a condition for the induced map of a power of i e t to be equal to the power of a induced map of i e t is given with redar to rauzy veech induction in section 3 we introduce a skew product which is extended from the rauzy map it is showed that this skewing transformation is ergodic and conservative relative to a product measure in the last section section 4 the major propositions studied in section 2 and section 3 are used to set up a cutting and stacking structure related to the rauzy veech induction of a power of i e t this shows that measure theoretically all the i e t s are totally rank one by interval a corollary is conducted that rank one transformations are dense g in the weak closure of a i e t measure theoretically 1 schlumberger westerngeco geosolution houston texas usa 2 corresponding author harbin

subset of gm which contains all the irreducible permutations on 1 2 m a permu tation is irreducible if and only if for any 1 k m 1 2 k 6 1 k or equivalently k j 1 j j 0 1 k m given m g 0 m the corresponding interval exchange transfor mation is defined by 1 1 t x x i 1 x i 1 x i 1 i where 11 12 1 m i 0 i 0 i j 1 j 1 i m obviously i 1 i 1 j 1 1 j and the transformation t which is also denoted by sends the ith interval to the i th position rauzy veech induction for t the rauzy map sends it to its induced map on 0 min m 1 m which is the largest admissible interval of form j 0 l 0 l given any permutation two actions a and b are a i i i 1 m i 1 1 m 1 i m m i 1 m 1 1 2 and b i i i m i 1 m 1 i m m 1 i m 1 3 the rauzy veech map z m g 0 m m g 0 m is determined by z a c 1 c 1 4 where c c is defined by c a m 1 m b m 1 m 1 5 2 z is a e defined on m for each g 0 m the matrices a a c in 1 4 are defined as the following a a i 1 m 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1

where 1 and 2 are the projection to the first coordinate and the second coordinate respectively iteratively zn a n 1 c n n n 1 9 where c n cncn 1 c 1 c 1 cn a b ci c z i 1 1 10 and a n a c 1 a c 1 c 2 a c 2 c 3 a c n 1 cn 1 11 the rauzy class c gm of is a set of orbits for the group of maps generated by a and b on the r invariant component m 1 c we have theorem 1 1 h masur 6 w a veech 8 let g 0 m the set of irreducible permutations for lebesgue almost all m normalized lebesgue measure on i is the unique invariant borel probability measure for t in particular t is ergodic for almost all theorem 1 2 w a veech 9 let g 0 m the set of irreducible permutations for lebesgue almost all m normalized lebesgue measure on i is rigid and rank one thus admits simple spectrum we extend veech s result to the following theorem theorem 1 3 all the notations as above suppose m 1 m n g m q n for lebesgue almost all t q is rank one by interval with flat stack thus it is also rigid 3 the theorem will be seen to imply that for the corresponding corresponding interval exchange trans formations each has a residual set of rank one transformations in its weak closure by kin also in its commutant next we introduce some result which would be utilized in section 5 and section 6 theorem 1 4 let m 1 g 0 m r r is the rauzy class containing then there exists on m 1 r a unique absolutely continuous invariant measure up to a scalar mutiple such that p see 2 1 9 is conservative and ergodic on m 1 r relative to the density of on m 1 is the restriction of a function which is positive rational and homogeneous of degree m on m next the induced map of p on m 1 will be described and a condition for a measurable func tion to be essential constant will be given by theorem 1 4 induced map p of p on m 1 is well defined measure theoretically then for a e x m 1 there exists n x n such that p x p n x x and there exists a a x such that p x a 1 a 1 what s more if we let a a m m 1 and define pa a m 1 by pa a 1 a 1 a 1 12 then for any y a p y pa there exists a set f containing countable many elements which are visitation matrices such that f 1 a a f is a partition of m 1 into infinitely many atoms note for any a f for lebesgue almost all a pi is defined for all i n to end this section we recall 9 5 of vee 3 theorem 1 5 let h be a separable hilbert space and ua be unitary operators on h suppose f m 1 h is a measurable function and f p x uaf x for a e x a a f then f is constant 2 powers of the induced map and the induced map of the powers without normalization the nth iteration of the rauzy map raises an m interval exchange trasformation on a subinterval jn with vector n and m permutation n see 1 9 note that jn in this section we pay more attention on the first return time of t jn the visitation matrix a n shows the orbit distribution of i j among i i s that is a n ij is the number of the visitation of t l i j 0 l aj aj is the first return time of i j to jn on ii thus the first return time of any point in i j is aj m i 1 a n ij that is aj equals the jth column sum of a n canonically this yields a stack structure with m stacks s 1 s 2 sm each corresponding to the t orbits of a subinterval of the j th stack sj has base i j and height aj t sends each level except for the top of sj to the higher level and sends the top back into jn i j suppose the first return time of t q to jn is rq x x jn then t qrq x x jn t ql x jn l 1 2 rq x 1 it is easily seen that though t qrq x jn the return time of t to jn may be strictly less than qrq x 4 lemma 2 1 all notations as above suppose a k j is the jth column sum of a k and each akj is odd then there exists 1 j 0 m such that a k 1 j 0 is even proof suppose zk k k let 0 k then a k 1 a k a where a is either 1 6 or 1 7 for the first case we see that a k 1 1 0 m 1 a k 1 0 m a k m for the second case we see that a k 1 1 0 m a k 1 0 m a k m definition 2 2 t satisfies the infinite distinct orbit condition i d o c by kean 4 if t j i j n 1 i m the negative trajactories of discontinuities of t are infinite disjoint sets lemma 2 3 if t satisfies the i d o c then t q also satisfies the i d o c proof suppose t q is t then the q m 1 discontinuities are dq t i i 1 j m 0 i q one may concern the point 0 since 0 t k for some 1 k m the i th preimage of 0 is the i 1 th preimage of k already contained in dq so what need to be shown is that the t q orbit of t i 1 j and that of t i 2 j are disjoint this is true since i 1 6 i 2 and 0 i 1 i 2 q proposition 2 4 if there exist j 1 j 2 n 1 j 1 j 2 m such that aj 1 6 aj 2 mod q then t q jn t jn 6 t jn t q jn proof let i ai aj 1 mod q then i ai 6 aj 1 mod q since aj 1 6 aj 2 mod q we know that 6 6 and j 1 j 2 correspondingly let k x x i i i k x x i i i then since t q satisfies i d o c t q jn k k 6 there exits x t q jn k k since t q jn is invertible there exits y k t q jn 1 k thus t q jn t jn y t ql 1 aj 1 y l 1 z t jn t q jn y t ql 2 aj 0 y l 2 z j 0 since aj 1 6 aj 0 mod q t q jn t jn y 6 t jn t q jn y remark 2 5 proposition 2 4 shows that if two subintervals of the induced map have different return times modulo q then the induced map of t and that of t q on the same interval jn do not commute 5 from lemma 2 1 and proposition 2 4 we can see that during the consequent iterations of rauzy map at least one of j 2 k j 2 k 1 is such an subinterval such that t 2 jk and t jk do not commute k 2 k 2 k 1 one may draw more general conclusion about the general case of t q q 1 q n from these propositions relation between t q jn and t jn are studied if we equalize the degree and study t q jn and t jn q it is interesting that these two transformation with the same domain and range both are jn may be equal to each other a condition for it to be true is given right after this paragraph one will see it is crucial for proving theorem 1 3 suppose ai 1 mod q i 1 2 m then for any x jn there exists a sequence of positive integers q ai 1 x ai 2 x aiq x such that t a x t jn q x a x k 1 q aik x and t aij x t q jn j 1 x t q jn j x 1 j q that is to say that j k 1 aik x is the jth return time of x jn under the trans formation t since ai 1 mod q i 1 2 m a 0 mod q we claim that t q jn t jn q 2 1 suppose t q jn x t a x to prove 2 1 the only thing needs to be verified is that a x a x a x a x is impled by a 0 mod q on the other hand the jth return time of x jn under t is a j x j k 1 aik x a j x j 6 0 mod q 1 j q thus a x a x that proves the following theorem theorem 2 6 all notations and definitions as above if ai 1 mod q t q jn t jn q 2 an ergodic skew product of rauzy map as an extension of the rauzy map a skewing transformation will be defined in this section we will show that this skew product is ergodic and conservative relative to a certain product measure this result is the fundament tool to prove the major result theorem 1 3 we locate the case to that the skewing group is a finite group and we reach the result a little bit indirectly i e we prove the ergodic property of a skew product conjugate to that we want starting with m q n m q 2 a finite group g is given by g gl m zq where zq is the ring of integers modulo q a map g g 0 m a b g is defined by g c a c mod q g 0 m c a b 2 2 the same notation g is used for a map g x g where x m 1 r r the rauzy class of since they are naturally associated it is well understood that is g x g x c x c x c x x the normalized rauzy map is p a 1 a 1 c p is the induced map of p on m 1 suppose for n n pn x p r x where r r 1 r 2 rn and if ri r 1 r 2 ri then pi x p ri x g r x g pr 1 x g pr 2 x g p x g x is associated with x one can under stand g r x as a closed path from to let g g r x x x prx x next it is shown that g is a semigroup of g based on the fact that p is an expansion theorem 2 7 g is closed under multiplication 6 proof suppose g r x g s y g x y x suppose ps y is associated with the visitation matrix a then y a we know that ps a m 1 therefore there exists y 0 x such that g s y g s y 0 and p s y 0 x then g r x g s y g r ps y 0 g s y 0 g r s 1 y 0 g s y 0 g s 1 y 0 g y 0 g r s y 0 thus g r x g s y g g is thus a sub semigroup of g let g g then g is a subsemigroup of the finite group g therefore g is a subgroup of g if we have two permutations 1 2 in the same irreducible rauzy class r by theorem 1 1 veech s ergodic theorem there exists x x 1 and n 0 such that p n x 1 x 2 assign g n x to g 1 2 of course there may be other choice but once a fixed one is assigned it is well defined g 1 2 understood as a path from 1 to 2 two paths may be connected in the following sense if 1 2 3 r y x 2 p s y x 3 and g s y g 2 3 then there exists x x 1 such that pr x y and gr x g 1 2 then g r s x gs y gr x g 2 3 g 1 2 it is obvious that g 2 1 g 1 2 g 1 now we are ready to define a skewing map w 0 x g 0 x g 0 where g 0 g 0 for some fixed 0 r that is w 0 x px h x where h x g 1 0 c x x g x g 0 x to understand w 0 we do some computation w 20 p 2 x h px h x wr 0 p r x h p r 1 x h pr 2 x h px h x let h r x h pr 1 x h pr 2 x h px h x next define a space x and a transformation w on x x r 0 x g 0 g 0 w x g 0 x px g x g 0 x the relation between w and w 0 is given by x x g 0 defined as x g 0 x x it is easy to see that is bijective since it is also true that w w 0 we have w w 0 are conjugate lemma 2 8 if r c a b then g c g c g g c 1 7 proof since g c g g c 1 g c g c 1 g c g c g we have g c g c 1 g c g c g c 1 g c g g c 1 g c thus g c g c g g c 1 lemma 2 9 let h h r x x x pr x x then h g 0 proof it is obvious that gr x generates g since g is finite gr x x x pr x x g by lemma 2 8 we have g g 0 g 0 g 0 since g c and g are conjugate g 1 and g 2 are conjugate for any 1 2 r 0 thus g and g 0 have the same number of elements since g g 0 g 0 g 0 g g 0 g 0 g 0 because is a conjugation wr x g 0 w r 0 x g 0 it is obvious that h g g 0 since h g 0 h g 0 next we show the ergodic property of the two skewing transfromations lemma 2 10 all notations as above and suppose is the invariant measure of p is the normalized haar measure on g 0 then w 0 is ergodic and conservative relative to the measure 0 r proof first the parallel properties of the induced map on x g 0 is verified then those of w 0 itself will be gained denote the induced map by w that is w x p x h x where p x p r x and h x h r x suppose f l 2 is essentially invariant under w that is f w z f z a e z then define a function f x h l 2 g 0 by f x f x recall the partition f 1 from section 0 suppose a a n let a f 1 it is also true that is associated with common c 1 c 2 cn and 1 2 n where ci c p i 1 x i p i 1 x since h n x h pn 1 x h x g 1 0 c p n 1 x pn 1 x g pn 1 x g 0 p n 1 x g 1 0 c x x g x g 0 x g 1 0 cn x n x g x g 0 nx g 1 0 c 1 g x g 0 1 8 hn x is constant on thus a unitary operator u h h may be defined as u x h n x 1 h x since is the haar measure counting measure here on g 0 u is an isometry thus a unitary operator since f w z f z z x g 0 we have f p x f p x f w 1 p x f x h 1 u f x 2 3 by theorem 1 5 we know that f is essentially constant this tells us i let f f x 1 f x 1 for such a x x it is well understood that f is a fixed function in h l 2 ii from 2 3 we know that f h n x f now we apply lemma 2 9 h g 0 thus f is constant on g 0 that is to say if f 1 is any w 0 invariant function in l 2 x g 0 the restricted map of f 1 on x g 0 is constant sincew 0 send an ele ment inx g 0 to an element inx c g 0 andr is the set c 1 c 2 ck k 0 ci a b 1 i k it is not hard to see that f 1 is constant on x g 0 therefore w 0 is ergodic w 0 is also conservative since p is conservative for all r r and g 0 are both finite theorem 2 11 w is ergodic and conservative relative to the measure r g 0 proof since w and w 0 are conjugate lemma 2 10 implies this result 3 totally rank one property for interval exchange transformations in this section g m is fixed that is to say an interval exchange is associated with m 1 based on theorem 2 11 we shall show the measure theoretic generic rank one property of the powers of the interval exchange transformations theorem 1 3 a positive matrix can be associated with the iteration of the rauzy transformation on x m 1 a given m permutation one way to see this is that once satisfies i d o c it is minimal the iterations are corresponding to the induced maps of on smaller and smaller subintervals what s more theorem 2 11 implies that for a e the orbit of will visit u e infinitely many times for any open subset of u m 1 if m is any m m positive matrix then m a c r is also a positive matrix therefore there exists c 1 c 2 cn with each ci a b 1 i n such that cncn 1 c 1 b a n is positive and b e mod q a n may be expressed by induction i a 1 a c 1 ii 3 3 1 a i 1 a i a ci c 2 c 1 ci 1 2 4 it is nice to see that for any b zn b 1 passing the same sequence of permutations as c 1 c 2 c 1 cncn 1 c 1 9 given 0 define an open set in m 1 e e be the identity in g 0 that is j e m 1 1 1 let j b b e e j then j 0 the above process will be continued in the proof of the following lemma lemma 2 12 all notations as above for a e m 1 and 0 there is an positive integer n 0 and an interval j 0 such that a t iqj are pairwise disjoint 0 i n 0 b t q is linear on t iqj 0 i n 0 c n 0 1 i 0 t iqj 1 d j t n 0 qj 1 proof we prove the corresponding results a e m 1 equivalently assume m 1 satisfies there exists k n such that w k e j based on theorem 2 11 in other words such form a set full measure since wk e is an element in j wk n e is an element in j suppose wk e is associated with the visitation matrix a then a e mod q suppose wk n e e then the associated matrix is a k n ab ab is positive and ab e mod q also we know that ab 1 ab 1 let ab 1 j 0 then since 1 1 it is true that 1 1 suppose t j q t with q m 1 1 g 0 q m 1 1 by induction it is easy to see that there exists 1 k q m 1 1 such that k 1 2 q 1 let j be the k th interval of since ab e mod q we have t j q t q j by theorem 3 1 6 now visiting each i j the same number of times points in each suninterval of come back to j coincidently for the first q times under t therefore if i i is the i th interval of we can let a t i be the first return time to j of t j t 1 i i under t let ai q t 1 a t i a i q thus t q j i i t q a i i i let n 0 a k then a t q l j 0 l n 0 are pairwise disjoint and b t q n 0 j j 1 2 q given an positive m m matrix m define v m max 1 i j k m mij mik then we have by vee 2 if mj m i 1 mij then mj v m mk 1 j k m v pm v m p a nonnegative m m matrix 10 therefore v ab v b recall that each a t i is one of the column summations of ab thus a t i v b a s j 1 i j q m 1 1 1 t s q this implies a i v b a j 1 i j q m 1 1 so the total length measure of the remaint of the major stack n 0 1 l 0 t q l j is n 0 j m q 1 1 i 1 a i i a k k m q 1 1 i 1 i 6 k a i i v b a k 2 q 1 v b a k 2 q 1 1 2 q 1 k v b 2 q 1 1 2 q 1 that is c n 0 1 l 0 t q l j 1 v b 2 q 1 1 2 q 1 1 in order to make the approximation coincide to 0 choose small enough such that 2 q and v b 2 q 1 1 2 q 1 combining a b c and theorem 2 11 for a fixed g 0 m almost all will visit j infinitely often under w we abtain a b c d in the lemma it is easy to see that theorem 1 3 is a corollary of lemma 2 12 proposition 2 13 let x b t be an automorphism system on a standard measure space suppose all powers of t such that this subset is a dense g set in wcl t and all transformations in it are rank one proof we say two partitions p 1 and p 2 satisfying p 1 p 2 if for any atom p p 2 there exists p 1 p 2 pm p 1 such that m p m i 1 pi next we use p n to denote the partition by dyadic sets of rank n let r n q s there existsb 0 1 such that pb q p n where pb q b sb s q 1 b x q 1 i 0 s ib then r n q is an open set in g aut x b suppose t has all powers t n n n rank one and rigid then wcl t has uncountable many elements w n q wcl t r n q is an open set in wcl t since all powers of t are rank one we have t n qw n q n n and t n n n are dense in wcl t thus qw n q is a dense open set in wcl t therefore n q w n q is a dense g set in wcl t with all elements rank one 11 corollary 2 14 all the notations as above suppose m 1 m n g m q n for lebesgue almost all it is true that there is a dense g subset of rank one transformations in the
