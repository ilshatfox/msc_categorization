duced by benoist which have some hyperbolicity but are non riemannian not cat 0 and with non c 1 geodesic flow the geometries are non strictly convex hilbert geometries in dimension three which admit com pact quotient manifolds by discrete groups of projective transformations we prove the patterson sullivan density is canonical with applications to counting and construct explicitly the bowen margulis measure of maximal entropy the main result of this work is ergodicity of the bowen margulis measure 1 introduction in 2004 yves benoist released the first results on geodesic flows of com pact quotients of properly convex domains in real projective space endowed with the hilbert metric proving that strict convexity of the domain is equiv alent to an anosov geodesic flow of the quotient ben 04 not long after benoist produced nontrivial examples of nonstrictly convex domains with compact quotients in dimension three and proved rigid geometric proper ties for these domains ben 06 see theorem 1 4 this family of 3 manifolds whose quotients we call the benoist 3 manifolds lack the anosov property but have have similar topological properties to non positively curved manifolds which are rank one hence they are promising candidates for studying the geodesic flow however the geometry is only finsler and not riemannian meaning angles are not defined the natural metric is not cat 0 and the geodesic flow is not c 1 in this work we extend the approach of knieper for rank one manifolds kni 97 kni 98 and study the geodesic flow of properly convex domains in real projective space known also as hilbert geometries without the strictly convex hypothesis for the first time we prove the following central result theorem 1 1 the bowen margulis measure is an ergodic measure of max imal entropy for geodesic flows of the benoist 3 manifolds in seeking the main result we develop the asymptotic geometry and patterson sullivan measures at infinity let denote the critical expo nent of the fundamental group acting on the universal cover it is known that is positive in this setting bra 20 1 http arxiv org abs 1705 08519 v 3 2 harrison bray theorem 1 2 the universal cover of a benoist 3 manifold admits a buse mann density of dimension called the patterson sullivan density and busemann densities of the same dimension 0 are unique up to constant let s x t be the sphere of hilbert radius t about x and let vol be a natural volume on this sphere as in sul 79 theorem 1 2 can be applied to prove theorem 1 3 let be a properly convex indecomposable hilbert geometry of dimension three which admits a cocompact action by a discrete torsion free group of projective transformations then for all x there is a constant a x 0 such that 1 a vol s x t e t a a corollary of theorem 1 3 is that the group is divergent historical remarks the hilbert metric on a properly convex domain in real projective space is named after hilbert s proposed solution to his fourth problem these geometries are examples of affine metric spaces for which lines are always geodesic though much work has been done for geodesic flows of strictly convex hilbert geometries little is known on the dynamics in the nonstrictly convex case ben 04 cra 11 cra 09 cra 14 b cm 14 as alluded to in the introduction benoist first proved that for any properly convex domain in n dimensional real projective space rpn which is divisible meaning admits a discrete cocompact action by a group of projective transformations the following are equivalent i is strictly convex ii the topological boundary is c 1 iii is hyperbolic and iv the geodesic flow of m is anosov ben 04 theorem 1 1 since the geodesic flow is also topologically transitive in fact mixing ben 04 theorem 1 2 it follows that there is a unique measure of maximal entropy in the strictly convex setting bow 75 fra 77 benoist then constructed examples of nonstrictly convex divisible hilbert geometries in dimension three which have some hyperbolicity but have iso metrically embedded flats ben 06 proposition 4 2 these flats appear as properly embedded triangles in meaning and which are isometric to r 2 with the hexagonal norm in the hilbert metric dlh 93 moreover he showed that any nonstrictly convex indecomposable divisible properly convex set in rp 3 must have the same structure theorem 1 4 ben 06 theorem 1 1 let sl 4 r be a discrete torsion free subgroup which divides an open properly convex indecompos able rp 3 and let m let t denote the collection of properly embedded triangles in then a every subgroup in isomorphic to z 2 stabilizes a unique triangle t ergodicity of bowen margulis measure for benoist 3 manifolds 3 b if 1 2 t are distinct then 1 2 c for every t the stabilizer stab contains an index two z 2 subgroup d the group has only finitely many orbits in t e the image in m of triangles in t is a finite collection of disjoint tori and klein bottles denoted by t if one cuts m along each t each of the resulting connected components is atoroidal f every open line segment in is included in the boundary of some t g if is not strictly convex then the set of vertices of triangles in t is dense in this structure is essential to make the arguments needed and we will refer back to parts of this theorem throughout the paper since a version of this theorem does not yet exist in higher dimensions our arguments are valid only in dimension three we call compact quotient manifolds of nonstrictly convex properly convex indecomposable domains the benoist 3 manifolds the existing theory does not apply to studying the geodesic flows of the benoist 3 manifolds the geodesic flow of has the same regularity of hence by benoist s dichotomy in the nonstrictly convex setting the ge odesic flow is not c 1 crampon s lyapunov exponents cannot be computed cra 14 b and pesin theory which requires the flow to be c 1 does not apply knieper s work uses the existence of an inner product and a notion of angle so his work on riemannian rank one manifolds cannot be directly applied kni 97 kni 98 the geometry is not cat 0 because the isometri cally embedded flats which are properly embedded projective triangles are not cat 0 so we cannot use results from the thesis of ricks dlh 93 ric 17 nonetheless we can adapt the methods of knieper in rank one following the patterson sullivan approach pat 76 sul 79 the irregularity of the ge ometry and our techniques to manage this comprise a significant portion of the paper the bowen margulis measure comes from the patterson sullivan density in a natural way and ergodicity follows a variation of the hopf ar gument hop 39 in the setting we study the stable and unstable sets are not even locally smooth and are not defined for a dense set of directions but we are still able to adapt this classical proof structure of the paper we first introduce hilbert geometries and the cen tral tools in section 2 in section 3 we gather lemmas on the asymptotic geometry and the compatible busemann function which apply to arbitrary hilbert geometries we then construct the patterson sullivan density for the universal cover of a benoist 3 manifold in section 4 and prove the shadow lemma lemma 4 8 and in section 5 we prove this construction is canon ical theorem 1 2 with application to growth rates of volumes of spheres and divergence of theorem 1 3 lastly in section 6 we construct the bowen margulis measure and complete the proof of the main result theo rem 1 1 4 harrison bray acknowledgements the author is very grateful to advisor boris hasselblatt to

stages of this work many thanks to the referee for valuable feedback which immensely improved the paper the author was supported in part by nsf rtg grant 1045119 2 preliminaries we say a domain rpn is properly convex if can be represented as a bounded convex set in some affine chart and denote by the topological boundary of in rpn define h to be a supporting hyperplane to a properly convex rpn if h is a codimension 1 projective subspace of rpn which intersects but not then a properly convex is strictly convex if every supporting hyperplane intersects at a single point for any properly convex domain fix an affine chart in which is bounded and define the hilbert distance between x y as follows define d x x 0 and for x 6 y let xy denote the projective line in this affine chart uniquely determined by x and y and take a b to be the distinct intersection points of xy with then d x y 1 2 log a x y b where a x y b a y x b a x y b is the euclidean cross ratio a projective invariant it will be useful to denote by xy the segment of xy between x and y in and xy xy r y the cross ratio of four projective lines l 1 l 2 l 3 l 4 intersecting at one point is well defined as l 1 l 2 l 3 l 4 a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 where ai li and a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 are collinear this can be used to prove that d is a well defined metric the group aut g psl n 1 r g is a subgroup of isometries of d the hilbert metric comes from a finsler norm f defined on the tangent bundle t see cra 14 a the norm f is only riemannian when is an ellipsoid and has the same regularity as the boundary of the domain sm 00 cra 14 a projective lines are geodesic and are the only geodesics in the strictly convex case but in general geodesics are not always lines the metric space d is complete and the topology induced by the metric d coincides with the ambient euclidean topology on in this affine chart we say that in rpn is divisible if there exists a discrete subgroup of aut acting properly discontinuously and cocompactly on also is decomposable if the cone over in rn 1 is decomposable and indecompos able if is not decomposable see mar 14 section 3 for more details let m denote the quotient manifold since geodesics are not unique for the benoist 3 manifolds we define the geodesic flow to be flowing along projective lines as is the case when is strictly convex more formally let be a divisible properly convex domain with dividing group and quotient manifold m let v r m be the projective line parameterized at unit hilbert speed uniquely determined by ergodicity of bowen margulis measure for benoist 3 manifolds 5 v t 1 m the unit tangent bundle to m for the finsler norm f the finsler unit tangent bundle to is denoted t 1 then the hilbert geodesic flow of is t t 1 t 1 defined by t v v t and this flow descends to the geodesic flow t on t 1 m the unit tangent bundle to the quotient note that this geodesic flow has the same regularity as the boundary of the universal cover for more details see cra 14 a section 2 4 formally a geodesic for the hilbert metric is a path in or m such that the length of any segment of is equal to distance between the endpoints on occasion we will parameterize at unit hilbert speed and treat as a mapping from r to or m to take advantage of the parameterization 2 1 busemann functions for any three points x y z we define the busemann function to be z x y d x z d y z evidently for all z the function z is anti symmetric meaning z x y z y z and satisfies the property of a cocycle that is z x y z y w z x w for all x y w also z x y d x y by the tri angle inequality lastly since is acting on by isometries z x y z x y for all geometrically z x y describes the signed distance between the hilbert spheres centered at z passing through x and y definition 2 1 we wish to extend the busemann functions to the bound ary define x y inf zn lim inf n zn x y x y sup zn lim sup n zn x y these functions exist and are bounded in absolute value by d x y for all x y and it is straightforward to verify for all x y w and that x y y x and x y y w x w x w x y y w since acts by isometries we also have x y x y then if indeed we may define and see that the anti symmetric cocycle and invariance properties of z for z extend to for for such the horosphere through x based at is the zero set of x denoted by h x 2 2 boundary points recall that a supporting hyperplane to at a point in is a projective hyperplane h such that h contains and h borrowing language from convex geometry we introduce the following terms definition 2 2 a point in is smooth if there is a unique supporting hyperplane to at the point in is extremal if is not contained in any open line segment inside 6 harrison bray note that smooth points in may not be c 1 points when is treated as a curve in an affine chart for the examples of interest to this work there will be a dense set of points in the boundary for which the derivative is not defined by benoist the complement of boundaries of properly embedded triangles in is exactly the set of smooth extremal points proposition 2 3 ben 06 proposition 3 8 let be a discrete torsion free subgroup of psl 4 r which divides an indecomposable divisible properly convex domain in rp 3 then a for every nontrivial line segment there exists a properly embed ded triangle such that b a point x is smooth if and only if x is not the vertex of any properly embedded triangle in it follows from theorem 1 4 that smooth extremal points are dense in in the setting of interest we will see that these smooth extremal points carry the hyperbolic behavior of the dynamics and the busemann functions will be well defined for these points remark 2 4 we point out a particular feature that is special for the benoist 3 manifolds and essential for our study by benzecri s thesis work ben 60 there are no angular points in the boundary of the universal cover of a benoist 3 manifold benoist extracts the consequences of this result in proposition 2 3 and theorem 1 4 part b if is a benoist 3 manifold then every point in the boundary of is either smooth or extremal the only exceptions to smoothness are vertices of properly embedded triangles and the only exceptions to extremality are points in the open edges of properly embedded triangles and these cannot coincide distinct properly embedded triangles have disjoint closures 2 3 busemann densities we introduce here a nonstandard definition of busemann densities to address issues with nonsmooth points in the bound ary where the busemann functions are not well defined definition 2 5 a busemann density of dimension 0 for is a family of finite borel measures x x supported on which satisfy quasi invariance for all x x and transformation rule for all x y and supp y the measures x and y are absolutely continuous and in particular their radon nikodym derivative satisfies e x y d x d y e x y note that if the busemann function was well defined for every point in we would recover the standard definition of a busemann conformal density to prove theorem 1 2 we will construct a busemann density for which almost every point is smooth and extremal and consequently the ergodicity of bowen margulis measure for benoist 3 manifolds 7 busemann functions will be defined almost everywhere and the density will be conformal in the usual sense 2 4 shadow topology at times we will take advantage of the ambient euclidean topology on represented as a bounded convex domain in an affine chart and the induced topology on and we define another topology on which interacts with the hilbert geometry inside as follows definition 2 6 let b x r be the open metric d ball about x of radius r then the shadow of radius r from x to y is denoted byor x y and is equal to the endpoints of projective rays based at x which pass through the open metric ball b y r these shadows generate a possibly basepoint dependent topology on called the shadow topology based at x more precisely the shadow topology based at x is the topology generated by the set or x y y r 0 it is straightforward to confirm that this topology agrees with the ambient euclidean topology and is therefore basepoint independent if the properly convex domain was strictly convex with c 1 boundary then a basis for this topology is the set or x y y for any fixed r 0 we cannot conclude as much in the nonstrictly convex setting but we will see that this topology is still well behaved near the smooth extremal points which will suffice for the development of the patterson sullivan theory 2 5 regular vectors for any vector v t 1 there is a unique oriented projective line v determined by v and we let v and v denote the inter sections of v in in backward and forward time respectively definition 2 7 a vector v t 1 is regular if both v and v are smooth extremal points the set of regular vectors in t 1 is denoted by t 1 reg regularity is preserved by projective transformations so a vector in t 1 m is regular if any lift in t 1 is regular and t 1 m reg is the set of all regular vectors in t 1 m 2 6 standing assumptions in section 3 we take to be an arbitrary properly convex set in real projective space in unspecified dimension in the remaining sections 4 5 and 6 we assume is a nonstrictly convex properly convex divisible indecomposable domain in real projective space of dimension 3 with discrete torsion free dividing group so that m is a benoist 3 manifold throughout the paper we fix an affine chart in which is bounded and work with in this affine chart 3 asymptotic geometry in this section we will prove some straightforward lemmas on the shadow topology and busemann functions for a hilbert geometry in any dimension 8 harrison bray these results are likely well understood by experts the proofs are included for completeness 3 1 the shadow topology the following lemma confirms that for an extremal point in shadows of a fixed radius generate the local topology at this fact requires that is both smooth and extremal lemma 3 1 let yn be a sequence of points converging along a projec tive line to then is an extremal point in if and only if for all r 0 x n n or x yn proof let be a point in distinct from and let y y 0 for each n let xn be a closest point to yn on the projective line from x to in the hilbert metric let an bn be such that d xn yn 1 2 log an xn yn bn since is extremal yn converging to implies the same for bn hence the hilbert distance between xn and yn goes to infinity as n grows hence for large n the projective ray x does not intersect the ball b x yn and is not in or x yn conversely see that if is not extremal then there is an open line segment contained in the shadow or x yn for all n 3 2 the busemann function and horospheres in this subsection we verify some regularity properties of the busemann function lemma 3 2 the busemann function is well defined on smooth points in and x y varies continuously over the inputs x and y in more specifically we have the following geometric description of the buse mann function for any x y and any smooth boundary point let h be the supporting hyperplane to at and let x y be the inter section points of the lines x y respectively with which are not if x 6 y let q x y be the unique intersection point of the line x y with the hyperplane h in projective space then if x y and are not collinear x y x y 1 2 log x q xq yq q and otherwise x y x y 1 2 log x x y proof suppose first that x y and are not collinear so there is a unique projective plane p containing x y and since is smooth in then is also smooth in p and there is a unique supporting hyperline l to p at for each n sufficiently large let pn be the projective plane ergodicity of bowen margulis measure for benoist 3 manifolds 9 p y x l q x x y pn x n y n y n x n qn xn zn x y figure 3 1 for the proof of lemma 3 2 in the left panel we take the 2 dimensional intersection of with the projec tive plane p determined by x and y in the right panel we take a sequence 2 dimensional intersections of with the projective plane pn determined by the projective lines xzn and yzn and see that zn x y zn x xn 1 2 log x n x xn x n where xn is as pictured in lemma 3 2 we confirm that if is smooth then the image on the right converges to the image on the left and x y 1 2 log x x x as pictured in the left panel containing the three points x y and zn as n goes to infinity pn converges to p in the gromov hausdorff sense in the projective plane pn let y n and y n be the intersection points of the projective line yzn with the boundary pn such that y n is closer to y than zn in the affine metric and choose x n x n similarly with respect to x then in the projective subspace pn the lines x n y n intersect at some point qn a picture detailing this set up is available in figure 3 1 a quick calculation confirms the cross ratio has the property that a x 1 x 2 b a x 2 x 3 b a x 1 x 3 b then since the cross ratio of four lines is well defined and qnx n qny n x n y n zn x y 1 2 log x n y n xqn znqn x n y n 1 2 log x n y n yqn znqn x n y n 1 2 log x n y n xqn yqn x n y n now as zn converges to the points x n and y n converge to x and y respectively hence the lines x n y n converge to the line x y both y n and x n converge to the smooth point and are contained in the plane pn which converges to the plane p so the lines y n x n must converge to the unique supporting projective line l to in p it follows that the sequence of points qn in pn which is the unique intersection point of the lines x n y n and x n y n converges to the intersection point q of the lines x y and l q the conclusion follows in this case where x y and are not collinear 10 harrison bray if x y and are collinear then let w be any other point in which is not collinear then a short calculation confirms that zn x y zn x w zn y w converges to x w w y 1 2 log x x y as desired finally it is now clear to see geometrically that the busemann functions at fixed vary continuously in the inputs x y thus we have corollary 3 3 when is smooth the busemann functions satisfy the anti symmetric cocycle and invariance properties as discussed in defi nition 2 1 lemma 3 4 the busemann functions restricted to smooth points in are continuous proof since is a smooth point in the busemann functions at are well defined by lemma 3 2 let x y be the other intersection points of x y with respectively let h denote the unique supporting hyperplane to at we proceed under the assumption that x 6 y so that x y and determine a projective plane p though the arguments easily generalize to the case where x y and are collinear by lemma 3 2 to complete the setup let q again be the unique intersection of the line x y with the hyperplane h in p see figure 3 2 for clarity let n in be a sequence of smooth boundary points converging to and let h n be the unique supporting hyperplanes to at n take x n to be the other intersection point of x n with and y n the other intersection point of y n with let pn be any projective plane containing x y and n since n converges to then pn also converges to the plane p containing x y and lastly take qn to be the intersection point in pn of the line x n y n with the supporting hyperplane h n by lemma 3 2 to show that n x y converges to x y it suffices to show that qn converges to q the points qn in the compact complement of must accumulate on some point q which must be in the plane p because the planes pn converge to p and must also be on the line x y so it cannot equal the lines nqn are disjoint from hence the same holds for the limiting line q then q lies on the unique supporting hyperline to p at and must equal the unique intersection of x y with this line since horospheres are zero sets of the busemann function we have corollary 3 5 horospheres based at smooth boundary points are globally defined continuous and vary continuously over smooth points 4 patterson sullivan theory in this section we construct the patterson sullivan density for the univer sal cover of a benoist 3 manifold the density is named for the independent work of patterson and sullivan in negative curvature and has since been ergodicity of bowen margulis measure for benoist 3 manifolds 11 y x h q x y y nx n n qn figure 3 2 for the proof of lemma 3 4 for clarity and simplicity the figure only depicts the case where is two dimensional and x y are such that x y 0 by lemma 3 2 to show that the busemann functions n x y converge to x y as n converges to it suffices to show that qn converges to q generalized to many settings including rank one manifolds pat 76 sul 79 kni 97 theorems 1 2 and 1 3 follow the study of these measures and their properties to generalize the results beyond dimension three we need deeper understanding of the geometry of the flats and hyperbolicity of the group in higher dimensions 4 1 poincare series and the critical exponent the critical exponent of a group acting discretely properly discontinuously and by isometries on d is the critical value of 0 s r for the poincare series p x y s e sd x y the group is of divergent type if p x y diverges and convergent type if p x y converges it is straightforward to verify that convergence of p x y s does not depend on x or y by the triangle inequality and that we can realize lim sup t 1 t logn x t where n x t d x x t for some x by previous work we have that 0 bra 20 when is a discrete group acting on with finite co volume dim 1 with equality if and only if is the ellipsoid this generalizes a result of crampon for the strictly convex case bmz 17 cra 09 in our setting where the quotient is compact the inequality dim 1 without the rigidity statement follows quickly from a theorem of tholozan that the volume growth entropy is bounded above by dim 1 tho 17 although the theorem of tholozan requires no group action at all in the cocompact case the critical exponent and volume growth entropy coincide hence the result can be applied to produce a bound on the critical exponent 12 harrison bray 4 2 patterson sullivan densities we will now prove that a busemann density exists for the universal cover of a benoist 3 manifold the argument will depend on features of the benoist 3 manifolds discussed in remark 2 4 proposition 4 1 there exists a busemann density of dimension 0 on called a patterson sullivan density proof the construction follows patterson and sullivan pat 76 sul 79 for s choose an observation point o for the measures and for the visual boundary for each x define a measure on by x s 1 p o o s e sd x o o where p is the dirac mass at p note that for s x s is supported on also by definition of the critical exponent if s then p x y s is finite for all x y so x s p x o s p o o s by compactness of we may extract a weak limit by choosing a convergent subsequence as s decreases to to obtain a finite nontrivial measure x lim sn x sn if the poincare series diverges at is of divergent type then the total mass of x s is pushed to as s decreases to and p o o s at the limit supp x if the poincare series converges at is of convergent type then we follow patterson s method for fuchsian groups which generalizes to any manifold group pat 76 first he showed it is possible to constuct an increasing function f r r with subexponential growth that is for all 0 there exists an x 0 0 such that for all x x 0 y 0 f x y f x ey and the modified poincare series pf x y s f d x y e sd x y has the same critical exponent and diverges at s pat 76 lemma 3 1 then we denote by f x a weak limit as s decreases to of fx s 1 pf o o s f d x o e sd x o o taking f 1 recovers x so we will check that these measures satisfy the definition of a busemann density for the case that is convergent we remark first that pf o o s exhibits the same convergence and di vergence behavior as p o o s for s 6 so f x s will be a finite nontrivial measure supported on point masses in much like x s taking a weak limit ergodicity of bowen margulis measure for benoist 3 manifolds 13 then produces a finite nontrivial measure f x supported on by the diver gence of pf o o s as s decreases to moreover for any borel measurable set a fx s 1 a 1 pf o o s g f d x go e sd x go go 1 a 1 pf o o s g f d x go e sd x go go a f x s a then the quasi invariance property from definition 2 5 holds for any weak limit f x since f x s is supported on countably many point masses in for s we compute d f x s d f y s o f x s o f y s o f d x o e sd x o f d y o e sd y o f d x o f d y o e s o x y as s indeed supp f x s supp f y s is pushed to by the increasing and subexponential properties of f for all 0 we have that for all o such that d o y is sufficiently large f d x o f d y o d x y f d y o e d x y then for any such that d x o is sufficiently large e d x y e s o x y d f x s d f y s o ed x y e s o x y to extend the radon nikodym derivative to the limit let d be any compact fundamental domain containing the fixed point o and let be arbi trary if is smooth by minimality of acting on ben 06 proposition 3 10 there exists a sequence of group elements n such that no converges to then apply lemma 3 2 to the smooth point to conclude no x y converges to the well defined busemann function x y as desired if is not smooth then must be extremal by benoist s structure the orems as discussed in remark 2 4 cover the projective ray from o to by orbits nd of d under the group so d no o diverges for each n choose a point zn on the projective ray from x to that lies in nd then zn converges to along a projective ray and by the triangle inequality no x y zn x y 2 d no zn since is extremal we can in fact choose a sequence of points zn on the projective ray from o to such that d no zn converges to zero and hence any accumulation of no x y as n goes to is bounded above and below by x y as desired to construct the sequence let n be the endpoint in of the projective ray from o passing through no it suffices to show that n converges to by contrapositive suppose n does not converge to choose r larger than twice the diameter of the compact fundamental domain d since is extremal by lemma 3 1 the shadows or o y around 14 harrison bray points y on the projective ray o from o to form a neighborhood basis for the assumption that n does not converge to implies that there exists a t and a subsequence nj such that for all y on the projective ray o distance at least t from o then nj is not in or o y and equivalently njo is not in the ball b y r but then for j large njo cannot be in the image of the fundamental domain njd and we conclude the argument remark 4 2 the patterson sullivan measures are borel measures on and have full support by quasi invariance and minimality of the action of on ben 06 proposition 3 10 4 3 the shadow lemma and applications in this subsection we prove sullivan s shadow lemma in the setting of interest sul 79 4 3 1 geometric lemmas define aut to be hyperbolic if has an attracting fixed point and a repelling fixed point in denoted and which are both smooth and extremal and has no other fixed points in this definition diverges from the classical definition that the translation length of is positive and realized in which is a consequence but not equivalent we choose this definition in this setting to separate stabilizers of triangles from group elements that act hyperbolically with north south dynamics since both such isometries have positive translation length real ized in we will need a proposition from the topological study of the benoist 3 manifolds which is straightforward given theorem 1 4 of ben 06 proposition 4 3 bra 20 if m is a benoist 3 manifold then is the disjoint union of hyperbolic isometries and stabilizers of properly em bedded triangles there are infinitely many conjugacy classes of hyperbolic group elemments the immediate goal is to prove the following geometric proposition sim ilar to that in bal 95 as needed for the shadow lemma proposition 4 4 fix x for any two noncommuting hyperbolic isome tries g h preserving and o a sufficiently small neighborhood of h there exists an r large and m n such that for all r r and all y either hmo or y x or g mhmo or y x we first prove two geometric lemmas let ca be the convex hull of a subset a in our affine chart for lemma 4 5 if h is a hyperbolic isometry then for any open sets o containing h and o containing h there exists an n n such that for all n n hn r co o and h n r co o proof if h is a projective transformation preserving with only two fixed points in and none inside since we assume is torsion free then h ergodicity of bowen margulis measure for benoist 3 manifolds 15 is a biproximal matrix so h is an attracting eigenline in rn 1 and h is a repelling eigenline the result follows since h preserves lemma 4 6 suppose h g are hyperbolic projective transformations preserv ing such that g 6 h then there exist neighborhoods vg vh of g h such that cvg cvh and there is no properly embedded triangle which intersects both cvg and cvh proof since g h are hyperbolic g h are smooth extremal points there are disjoint open neighborhoods vg vh around g h respectively in whose closures are also disjoint and for which g 6 v g and h 6 v h if the lemma was false by convexity of cgnvg ch nvh there would exist a sequence of properly embedded triangles n such that gnvg n 6 and hnvh n 6 for all n since the collection of properly embedded triangles is closed in ben 06 proposition 3 2 the n accumulate on some properly embedded in because g h are hyperbolic n 1 g nvg g and n 1 h nvh h then g h which contradicts the smooth extremal property for fixed points of hyperbolic isometries proof of proposition 4 4 applying lemma 4 6 there are pairwise disjoint neighborhoods v h v g of h g respectively such that no properly embed ded triangle intersects any pair of convex hulls of these neighborhoods in in particular this means for vi vj v h v g with vi 6 vj for any x cvi and y cvj the projective line xy is contained in and is not contained in any single properly embedded triangle by lemma 4 5 there exists an n 1 such that h n r cv h v h for all n n 1 moreover there exists an n 2 such that g n r cv g v g implying g n cv h g n r cv g v g r cv h then for all y and all n max n 1 n 2 either h ny cv h or h ng ny cv h let m max n 1 n 2 next we claim that for all r 0 for h m h mg m and r d x x if y cv h then 1 v h 1 or y x or r y x which completes the proof of the lemma note first that the rightmost inclu sion is true for all if p b x r then d 1 p x d 1 p 1 x d x 1 x r r so if a projective ray with 0 y intersects b x r then 1 is a projective ray with 1 0 y which intersects b x r r for the leftmost inclusion we show that v h or y x for sufficiently large r first for any v h the projective ray y is contained in but not any properly embedded triangle by choice of v h v h lemma 4 5 then take r max v h d x y and the leftmost containment is satisfied 16 harrison bray 4 3 2 the shadow lemma first we need a basic lemma lemma 4 7 for all or x y d x y 2 r x y x y d x y proof the rightmost inequality is immediate from the triangle inequality for the leftmost inequality let z converge to along the projective line from x to divide the projective line xz into two segments by its first intersection p with the closed ball b y r then by the triangle inequality d x y d x p r and d z y d z p r so d x y 2 r d x p d p z d y z d x z d y z z x y the lower bound follows lemma 4 8 shadow lemma let be a busemann density of dimension 0 on then for every x and all suffiently large r there exists a c 0 such that for all 1 c e d x x x or x x ce d x x proof we follow the elegant proof of roblin rob 03 since is an isometry and by quasi invariance x or x x x or 1 x x 1 x or 1 x x 4 1 by the transformation rule definition 2 5 4 2 or 1 x x e 1 x x d x 1 x or 1 x x or 1 x x e 1 x x d x combining equations 4 1 and 4 2 with lemma 4 7 4 3 or 1 x x e d 1 x x d x x or x x or 1 x x e d 1 x x 2 r d x so letting x x 4 4 e d 1 x x x or 1 x x x or x x e d 1 x x e 2 r x the rightmost inequality of equation 4 4 gives us the rightmost inequality of the lemma immediately by proposition 4 3 there exist two noncommut ing hyperbolic isometries g h then apply proposition 4 4 to obtain open sets o 1 h mo o 2 g mhmo such that for all r sufficiently large and ergodicity of bowen margulis measure for benoist 3 manifolds 17 all either o 1 or 1 x x or o 2 or 1 x x the x have full support remark 4 2 so we may take 0 1 c min x oi to complete the proof 4 3 3 boundaries of flats are null sets let s x r y d x y r denote the sphere of hilbert radius r about x restricted to a properly embedded triangle similarly b x r is the open ball of hilbert radius r about x restricted to the triangle for a properly embedded triangle in let stab lemma 4 9 pick a tiling of a properly embedded triangle by stab such that p is in the interior of a fundamental domain in the tiling choose r so that the open b p r covers the compact fundamental domain con taining p if nr denotes the minimal number of b p r which cover s p r where stab then nr is quasi linear in r proof the projective triangle with the hilbert metric is isometric to r 2 with a hexagonal norm dlh 93 by benoist s theorem 1 4 c stab is isomorphic to z 2 up to index 2 under de la harpe s isometry this z 2 group acts by translations so the growth of orbits of a fundamental domain under the hexagonal norm is quasi linear proposition 4 10 the boundary of any properly embedded triangle is a null set for any busemann density of dimension 0 proof choose a fundamental domain t for the action of stab on a properly embedded triangle a point p t and r 0 as in lemma 4 9 let x be in a fundamental domain d for the action on such that t d choose r large enough that d b x r and b p r 0 b x r then the b x r covers and the minimal number of such that ni 1 i b x r covers s p r is bounded above by the nr in lemma 4 9 for each r choose a covering of s x r by nr many ib x r and assume that i stab for i 1 nr next we show for all large enough r nr i 1 o 2 r x ix let r 2 r consider any projective ray based at p such that let denote projective ray based at x such that then parameterizing at unit speed we have that d t t d x p r for all t 0 since p and then s p r 6 and there exists a i such that b ix r 6 let t 0 be such that d t ix r then d t ix d t t d t ix 2 r and o 2 r x ix lastly for each i 1 nr let qi s p r b ix r 6 then r d p qi d p x d x ix d ix qi d x ix 2 r implying d x ix 2 r r for all i 1 nr by lemma 4 8 4 5 x nr i 1 x o 2 r x ix nr i 1 ce d x ix ce 2 re rnr 18 harrison bray given that nr is quasi linear in r by lemma 4 9 that 0 and that equation 4 5 holds for all r sufficiently large we conclude x 0 then the following corollary is immediate after proposition 2 3 corollary 4 11 the set of smooth extremal points in is full measure for any busemann density of dimension 0 5 busemann densities are unique in this section we complete the proof of theorem 1 2 the arguments in this section follow those of sullivan and knieper sul 79 kni 97 we give brief proofs mainly to point out when we need corollary 4 11 lemma 5 1 local estimates if x is a busemann density of dimension 0 on then for all x and all sufficiently large r there exists a constant b r such that for y with d x y large 1 b r e d x y x or x y b r e d x y proof note that if y x then we apply lemma 4 8 to obtain the result else for some tiling of with compact fundamental domain d choose r large enough that for all x d we have d b x r 2 choosing d such that y d there exists a such that x d b y r 2 by the triangle inequality o r 2 x x or x y o 3 r 2 x x applying lemma 4 8 if r is sufficiently large then there is a uniform constant c such that 1 c e d x x x o r 2 x x x or x y x o 3 r 2 x x ce d x x our final observation is that since x b y r 2 1 ce r 2 e d x y x or x y ce r 2 e d x y it follows that busemann densities have no atomic part corollary 5 2 busemann densities of dimension 0 on have no atoms proof it suffices to check for smooth extremal points by corollary 4 11 let yn be a sequence of points in converging to along a projective line then apply the local estimate lemma lemma 5 1 for fixed sufficiently large r to the shadows ox yn r the conclusion follows lemma 3 1 corollary 5 3 busemann densities of dimension 0 are equivalent ergodicity of bowen margulis measure for benoist 3 manifolds 19 proof let x x be busemann densities of dimension let be a smooth extremal point and take a sequence yn of points in converging to along a projective line then for all sufficiently large n d x yn is large enough to apply lemma 5 1 to both densities and and conclude 1 b r b r x or x yn x or x yn b r b r by lemma 3 1 since yn converges to along a projective line and is smooth and extremal the shadows or x yn form a nested decreasing se quence with intersection thus since smooth extremal points form a set of full measure for any dimensional busemann density by corollary 4 11 we conclude that x and x are equivalent proposition 5 4 if x is a busemann density of dimension 0 on then for all x the measure x is ergodic for the action on proof let a be a borel invariant set with positive x measure for all x since the measures are equivalent define a new density x b x a b for all x since a is invariant and has positive measure it suffices to show that x is a busemann density also of dimension then x is equivalent to x by corollary 5 3 and we conclude that x ra x ra 0 proving ergodicity of x for it is clear that x is nontrivial and finite since smooth extremal points are full measure and the transformation rule is well defined for smooth ex tremal points the proof that x satisfies the transformation rule does not differ significantly from kni 97 proposition 4 15 and the proof of quasi invariance is unchanged theorem 5 5 busemann densities of dimension 0 on are unique up to a constant proof let x x be two busemann densities of dimension since x and x are equivalent it suffices to show that the radon nikodym derivative d x d x is invariant on the set of smooth extremal points which are a set of full measure by corollary 4 11 ergodicity of x then implies that the radon nikodym derivative is constant x almost everywhere since the densities have the same transformation rule almost everywhere this constant does not depend on x verifying that the radon nikodym derivative is invariant on the set of smooth extremal points is straightforward combining proposition 4 1 and theorem 5 5 gives us theorem 1 2 5 1 volume growth and divergence of in this section we see that is divergent with all the tools is place the proof does not differ from that of knieper for rank one manifolds but we include it here for completeness kni 97 theorem 5 1 first we prove theorem 1 3 on the growth rate of volumes of spheres let volx t be a hilbert volume form on s x t which is equivariant meaning 20 harrison bray vol x t volx t we abbreviate with vol when the context is clear for a definition of sphere volume see the definiton of area of a smooth hyper surface in ver 13 equation 1 3 since the nonsmooth points in the spheres come from nonsmooth points in the boundary of which form a countable set in this case by benoist theorem 1 4 these nonsmooth points in spheres are measure zero and the definition can be applied indeed vernicos studies asymptotics of this sphere volume for any hilbert geometry not necessarily smooth ones see ver 13 theorem 2 1 proof of theorem 1 3 let x denote the patterson sullivan density of dimension existence of which we constructed in proposition 4 1 by previous work we have that 0 bra 20 let throughout the proof let r be sufficiently large to apply sullivan s shadow lemma lemma 4 8 and consequently the local estimate in lemma 5 1 consider r 6 r by compactness of s x t we can take xi nt i 1 to be a maximal r separating set in s x t in particular if i 6 j then d xi xj r implying b xi r 3 b xj r 3 maximality implies s x t nt i 1 b xi r by the local estimate lemma 5 1 there exists a b x such that for all r 2 r 6 r and xi each of which is distance t from x we have 1 b e t x or x xi be t then x x nt i 1 or x xi nt i 1 x or x xi ntbe t and x x nt i 1 or 3 x xi nt i 1 x or 3 x xi nt b e t since x is a constant depending on x there is a number b x such that 1 b e t nt b e t by cocompactness of acting on and equivariance of the sphere volumes volx t on the spheres of radius t around x there exists an r such that for all y s x t 1 volx t b y r s x t then we may arrange for an such that volx t s x t nt i 1 volx t b xi r s x t nt b e t ergodicity of bowen margulis measure for benoist 3 manifolds 21 and volx t s x t nt i 1 volx t b xi r 3 s x t nt 1 b e t which concludes the proof of the theorem corollary 5 6 let be a properly convex divisible indecomposable hilbert geometry of dimension three with dividing group then is of divergent type proof letd be a compact fundamental domain for the action on then for s p x y s converges so we can apply fubini s theorem to the following integral d e sd x y d vol y d e sd x y d vol y 0 e st vol s x t dt as s decreases to the right hand side diverges by theorem 1 3 6 the bowen margulis measure in this section we introduce the invariant bowen margulis measure on t 1 denoted bm following the standard construction sul 79 rob 03 kni 97 and prove theorem 1 1 6 1 definition and properties let x be the patterson sullivan den sity constructed in proposition 4 1 which is a busemann density of dimen sion 0 for each x and borel set a t 1 define 6 1 xbm a v a length v a e v x v v x v d x v d x v where t 1 is the footpoint projection and length is hilbert length since the busemann function is well defined almost everywhere lemma 3 2 and corollary 4 11 this definition is valid then xbm is invariant by the definition of a dimensional busemann density and the cocycle property of the busemann function on t 1 m the measure is finite and we may normalize it so xbm t 1 m 1 recall that t 1 reg is the set of regular vectors which are vectors v whose endpoints v v in are both smooth and extremal and t 1 m reg is the projection of these vectors to t 1 m definition 2 7 the following lemma is clear given the discussion above lemma 6 1 the regular set t 1 m reg is a set of full bm measure 22 harrison bray for the remainder of the paper we will let bm x bm for some x note that since the xbm y bm are equivalent by construction we will have that they are in fact equal up to a constant after the proof of ergodicity is complete 6 2 ergodicity let d be the finsler metric on t 1 m discussed in bra 20 section 4 1 define the t invariant strong unstable foliations for v t 1 m reg to be w su v w t 1 m d tv tw 0 as t and similarly for w ss v the strong stable foliation which is contracted in forward time the weak unstable set w ou v is the disjoint union of w ss tv for all t r and similarly for the weak stable set w os v this gives us a flow invariant foliation of the weak unstable sets by strong unsta ble leaves and similarly for the stable foliation lemma 6 2 for all regular v w with v 6 w we have w ss v w ou w 6 proof if v is regular then w ss v is defined by a geometric characterization on the universal cover ben 04 bra 20 w ss v w t 1 v w w hv v w os v w t 1 v w where hv v is the globally defined horosphere through v at v corol lary 3 5 the result follows the geometric interpretation of the busemann function in lemma 3 2 6 2 1 the hopf argument we first establish or recall basic facts which set up the ergodicity proof let f t 1 m r be integrable then the forward and backward birkhoff averages of f for are respectively f v lim t 1 t t 0 f s v ds f v lim t 1 t t 0 f s v ds by the birkhoff ergodic theorem f and f exist for bm almost every v t 1 m see kh 95 theorem 4 1 2 the following lemma is straightforward to verify by compactness of t 1 m lemma 6 3 forward birkhoff averages of continuous functions are con stant on strong stable leaves of regular vectors and backward birkhoff aver ages as constant on strong unstable leaves ergodicity of bowen margulis measure for benoist 3 manifolds 23 since is invertible f f bm almost everywhere see kh 95 propo sition 4 1 3 we have the following classical lemma which we do not prove here which allows us to verify ergodicity by proving f is constant almost everywhere for all continuous f lemma 6 4 if f is constant bm almost everywhere for all continuous f then every t invariant l 1 integrable function is constant bm almost everywhere we make the arguments locally in the universal cover and conclude ergod icity by transitivity of the flow on the quotient we define strong unstable conditional measures as induced patterson sullivan measure on strong un stable leaves 6 2 suv a w a w su v e w x w d x w we can define the strong stable conditionals ssv on w ss v similarly note that for w w su v we have w hv v and w v hence w x w is constant over w w su v and the conditional measures will not depend the point in a leaf of the foliation we will say the strong unstable folia tion is absolutely continuous if the associated strong stable conditionals are absolutely continuous as measures lemma 6 5 the strong unstable foliations are absolutely continuous for all regular points in t 1 m proof for each t we have uniform contraction along flow lines 6 3 d t su v d su tv e t by the cocycle property of the busemann function this gives us absolute continuity of the strong unstable conditionals along flow lines it remains to consider v w regular vectors on the same strong stable leaf to determine absolute continuity of the strong unstable conditionals we define a measurable bijection h w su v w su w where for u w su v we let h u be the unique regular vector such that h u w h u u and w w h u 0 in other words h u w su w w os u lemma 6 2 then we compute the density v w u d suw dh suv u e u u h u and see that 0 v w u as well to complete the computation let a w su w then a v w u dh su v u u a e u u h u e u x h u d x u u a e u x u d x u suw a 24 harrison bray by the cocycle property of the busemann function remark 6 6 the final remark we make before proving ergodicity is that locally the bm measure of a borel set a agrees with the bm measure of a lift of a so we can exploit the patterson sullivan product structure of bm on such sufficiently small neighborhoods see definition 6 1 we will refer to this feature as the local product structure of bm then it is clear that for such a small borel measurable set n t 1 m which we identify with a lift in t 1 we have bm n 0 if and only if su v n 0 for bm almost every v in the arguments below we abuse notation and treat the measures as conditional measures on a small neighborhood in the universal cover theorem 6 7 the bowen margulis measure is ergodic for the geodesic flow proof let f be a continuous function and q v t 1 m f v q for some q q such that bm q 0 then su v q 0 for bm almost every v t 1 m reg by the local product structure of the bowen margulis measure and that t 1 m reg has full bm measure lemma 6 1 by lemma 6 5 the unstable conditionals are absolutely continuous for every pair of regular vectors so suv q 0 for every regular vector v let g be the set of full bm measure on which f f by invertibility of the flow and kh 95 proposition 4 1 3 then g is also a set of full suv measure for bm almost every v then for almost every v we have su v q 0 which implies suv q g 0 and so there exists a w q g w su v thus for all u g w su v a full suv measure set we have f u f u f w f w q since f is constant on strong unstable sets by t invariance of f lemma 6 3 thus u q and su v q 1 for bm almost every v this implies bm q 1 by the local product structure of bm since q is dense in r we conclude f is constant on a set of full measure and by lemma 6 4 the proof is complete 6 3 a measure of maximal entropy the measure theoretical entropy of with respect to the finite measureable partition a a 1 am also know as the kolmogorov sinai entropy is h 1 a lim n 1 n h a n where h b k i 1 log bi bi is the entropy of a finite measur able partition b b 1 bk and a n n 1 i 0 ia is the partition consisting of all intersections n 1 i 0 iaji over all possible j 1 jn 1 1 m then the measure theoretic entropy of the pair 1 is h 1 sup a h 1 a ergodicity of bowen margulis measure for benoist 3 manifolds 25 and the entropy of for the geodesic flow t is h h 1 by work in bra 20 t is entropy expansive with expansivity constant 0 then by bow 72 theorem 3 5 h h a for diam a lemma 6 8 there exists some a 0 such that bm e na for all a n proof the proof does not differ from kni 98 lemma 2 5 theorem 6 9 the bowen margulis measure is a measure of maximal en tropy proof the proof is as in kni 98 theorem 5 12 first using lemma 6 8 one computes h bm a n n log a in bra 20 proposition 7 3 since the quotient is compact and by a technical lemma of crampon for hilbert geometries cra 09 lemma 8 3 the arguments of manning extend man 79 allowing us to conclude htop then by the variational principle htop h bm lim n 1 n h bm a n lim n 1 n n log a htop references bal 95 werner ballmann lectures on spaces of nonpositive curvature volume 25 of dmv
