earthquake trajectory leaving compact sets in the moduli space of the once punctured torus mirzakhani showed that the earthquake flow is measurably equivalent to the horocyclic flow which has been studied extensively our main result shows that the earthquake flow and the horocyclic flow behave very differently in cusp excursions in particular we prove a relation between the systole function and continued fractions and discuss the cusp excursions of earthquake trajectories 1 introduction throughout the paper we will let s s 1 1 be the once punctured torus m s be the moduli space and t s be the teichmu ller space the motivation of the paper comes from the result of mirzakhani in 8 showing that the earthquake flow is ergodic with respect to the natural finite measure s coming from the weil petersson measure on the bundle p 1 m s of unit length geodesic measured laminations we use et x to denote the earthquake flow for time t along the measured lamination and sys x to be the length of the systole of x see section 2 for definitions the systole length sys x is the same as sys x with the prior in the bundle context and the latter in m s the study of cusp excursions for the earthquake flow is aimed at understanding the constant cf x defined with respect to a continuous increasing function f by cf x lim sup t log sys et x f t ergodicity implies that cf x is a constant for almost every x with respect to s the goal is to find the threshold function f such that cf is a nonzero number that depends only on the surface one of the classical approaches to cusp excursion is the logarithmic laws initiated by sullivan 10 the borel cantelli lemma and a volume estimate of the thin part of the moduli space can be used to obtain a discrete upper bound for clog t more specifically for a general surface sg if there exists a continuous function v such that the measure of the thin part of p 1 m sg is o v then we obtain lim sup n log sys en x logn lim 0 log v log where n n for almost every x p 1 m sg with respect to s see section 4 in 8 mirzakhani showed that the earthquake flow is measurably equivalent to the horocyclic flow which led to the ergodicity of the earthquake flow the logarithm law of the horocyclic flow by athreya in 1 states that the discrete upper 1 http arxiv org abs 1506 04534 v 4 2 ser wei fu bound above is actually an equality even in the continuous case in other words the constant clog t for the horocyclic flow is equal to 1 2 almost everywhere however the earthquake flow fails to satisfy the same property our main result shows that c t is infinity almost everywhere for the once punctured torus theorem 1 let s be the once punctured torus for almost every x p 1 m s with respect to s we have lim sup t log sys et x t the theorem echoes the result shown by minsky and weiss 7 proposition 8 1 stating that in the case of the once punctured torus the trajectories of the horo cyclic flow and the earthquake flow can be infinitely far apart as a corollary of the proof of the main theorem we identify a family of earthquake trajectories as sociated to the golden ratio that goes arbitrarily deep into the thin part with the slowest possible speed we study the systole function along earthquake trajectories by explicitly parametriz ing the space of hyperbolic metrics the simple closed geodesics and the space of measured laminations on the once punctured torus the systole functions on earth quake trajectories are closely related to the continued fraction expansion of slopes that depends on x see section 3 we show the result of the classical argu ment for cusp excursions in section 4 for completeness and prove the main theorem in section 5 the proof is a straight forward computation of the limit supremum for any given x and the measure of the set that satisfies our statement acknowledgement the author thanks jayadev athreya for suggesting the project as well as many useful conversations the author is also grateful for discussions with christopher leininger matthew stover and joseph vandehey 2 background we use a similar choice of notation as in 8 let t s be the teichmu ller space which is the space of hyperbolic metrics on s the mapping class group mod s the group of automorphisms of s up to isotopy acts on t s and the quotient is the moduli space m s the weil petersson symplectic form induces a finite measure on m s let ml s denote the space of measured laminations on s see 2 we use notation similar to 8 and a thorough description of properties of ml s can be found in 2 the space ml s carries a mapping class group invariant volume form th introduced by thurston given x t s and ml s we denote the length of the lamination in the hyperbolic metric x by x finally we let pt s t s ml s be the bundle of geodesic measured lamination over t s p 1 t s be the unit sub bundle with respect to the hyperbolic length of and p 1 m s be the quotient p 1 t s mod s the earthquake invariant measure on p 1 m s considered by mirzakhani in 8 is a finite measure denoted by s the earthquake map is a generalization of twisting along simple closed geodesics with respect to a hyperbolic metric on s see 3 11 an earthquake along a simple closed curve seen as a measured lamination is defined to be a left twist of hyper bolic length 1 an earthquake along a measured lamination is defined to be the limit of the earthquake maps along a sequence of weight simple closed curves that converges to the measured lamination the earthquake map is independent of the cusp excursions for the earthquake flow 3 sequence you choose 3 11 and can be extended into a flow 8 we denote the earthquake flow at time t by et x pt s where et x y with y being the hyperbolic metric obtained by twisting x along for distance t the earthquake flow on p 1 m s is ergodic with respect to s this implies that almost every trajectory of the earthquake flow in m s is dense alternatively we consider the systole length function sys that maps x pt s to the length of the shortest closed geodesic with respect to x the ergodic property implies that lim inf t sys et x 0 for almost every x pt s the teichmu ller space of the once punctured torus t s 1 1 is isometric to h 2 and is parametrized via the fenchel nielsen coordinate we fix a pair of generators for the fundamental group of s 1 1 that intersect once then every oriented simple closed geodesic corresponds to a pair of integers given by the algebraic intersection number with the generators we denote an oriented simple closed geodesic by a b where gcd a b 1 the space of measured laminations ml s 1 1 is parametrized by the slope the ratio of a and b and the hyperbolic length with respect to x we say that a mea sured lamination is rational if it is a weighted simple closed geodesic and irrational otherwise let us setup the fenchel nielsen coordinate for x t s 1 1 and a b a simple closed geodesic the fenchel nielsen coordinate of x with respect to is x x where x is the twist parameter we choose the twist parameter in the following manner let c d be an oriented simple closed geodesic such that ad bc 1 the twist parameter x 0 if and only if x is the hyperbolic metric that minimizes the length of c d for the fixed length x the twist parameter is normalized such that integer valued twist parameters correspond to metrics obtained by dehn twists about the twist parameter increases linearly along the earthquake trajectory of et x 3 the punctured torus in this section we prove that the systole length function on a earthquake trajec tory can be approximated via continued fraction expansions of irrational slopes proposition 2 fix a simple closed geodesic if x t s 1 1 has fenchel nielsen coordinate l p q with respect to where gcd p q 1 and p q 0 1 then c 1 l e l 2 q sys x c 2 l e l 2 q where c 1 l c 2 l both limits to 4 when p q are fixed and l goes to proof we consider a once punctured torus with a hyperbolic metric x t s 1 1 figure 1 below shows a fundamental domain in the upper half plane that is chosen canonically with a given fenchel nielsen coordinate l p q with respect to the edges are identified by colors via hyperbolic isometries the length ratio between the blue and the orange edges is equal to p q p we use r l to denote the length of the shortest geodesic arc with endpoints on it is well known that r r l l and r l 2 log coth l 4 2 log el 2 1 el 2 1 4 ser wei fu figure 1 a fundamental domain for x represented by l p q for fixed p q 0 1 the systole function is realized by a simple closed curve that intersects more than once when l x is large enough we use the analogy from the flat torus case and look at the length of simple closed curves that intersect exactly q times as seen in figure 2 figure 2 the flat torus analogy we obtain the following inequality involving a the length of with respect to l which came from switching the role of and in the pictures qr a l qr a qa 2 since consists of q geodesic segments from to the left hand side is obtained from r a the right hand side is obtained by considering a piecewise geodesic homotopic to the piecewise geodesic goes along the geodesic segment that realizes the injectivity radius of q times and travel along otherwise reorganizing the terms will get us e a 4 tanh a 4 e l 2 q tanh a 4 a closed curve homotopic to is obtained by concatenating q radial segments between the two circles in figure 1 the hyperbolic length of the radial segments goes to zero as l since the euclidean length of the segments goes to zero while being bounded distance away from the x axis hence a 0 as l which implies that e a 4 tanh a 4 and tanh a 4 are both approximately a 4 in other words there exists c 1 l c 2 l that both converges to 4 such that c 1 l e l 2 q a c 2 l e l 2 q to complete the proof we need to show that the length of is shorter than any other simple closed geodesic for large l in fact the geodesic homotopic to is the only simple closed geodesic whose length goes to zero as l therefore the estimate holds for the systole length cusp excursions for the earthquake flow 5 the estimate given by proposition 2 allows us to construct explicit sequence of sample points along the earthquake trajectory the sequence of sample points will be used in the proof of the main theorem for a lower bound of c t x proposition 3 for any x t s 1 1 and any irrational ml s 1 1 we have lim inf t syset x 0 proof it suffices to construct a sequence tn such that sysetn x goes to zero as n without loss of generality we assume that x 1 there exists a sequence of simple closed geodesics n such that n x 1 n in ml s 1 1 fix 0 and t 0 there exists n n t such that n n implies the following syset x syset x n n x for all 0 t t let be a closed geodesic that realizes sys x and m for some m n we will assume that m is large enough from here on hence the length of will also be large enough we observe that there exists a pair p 0 q 0 such that is the systole of x 0 x p 0 q 0 in fenchel nielsen coordinate with respect to let x 1 be x p 1 q 1 with p 1 q 1 be the least rational number larger than p 0 q 0 with 1 q 1 q 0 we iteratively define xj from xj 1 similarly and choose tj to correspond with xj on the earthquake flow let k be such that tk t tk 1 the choice of xj s along with the estimates in proposition 2 imply that the finite sequence sysetj x x 1 j 1 k is decreasing therefore inf 0 t t syset x 4 e x 2 qk the value of qk uniquely depends on p 0 q 0 and k since the length of is fixed we use proposition 2 to conclude that the ratio x q 0 as a function of m converges to a constant hence it suffices to consider the ratio q 0 qk and show that it goes to infinity as m goes to infinity we use some properties of continued fractions from 4 in the rest of the proof by construction for qj 6 1 pj qj is a convergent of p 0 q 0 to be more specific if p 0 q 0 is a 0 a 1 a 2 an in the usual convention of continued fraction expansion then pj qj is a 0 a 1 a 2 ah j where h j is equal to n 2 j or n 2 j 1 since only the odd convergents are greater than p 0 q 0 the ratio q 0 qk depends on the continued fraction expansion of p 0 q 0 in partic ular the ratio grows with k unless qk 1 we observe that q 0 qk goes to infinity as k goes to infinity whenever p 0 q 0 converges to an irrational number as m in creases which is a consequence of being irrational therefore for any fixed as t increases m and k go to infinity and that completes the proof 4 discrete upper bound we include a discussion on the classical upper bound obtained by the borel cantelli lemma for completion the volume estimate of the thin part for general surfaces sg can be obtained through mirzakhani s generalized mcshane s identity 9 which is beyond the scope of this paper for the next proposition we need 6 ser wei fu theorem 4 mcshane identity let x be a point in the teichmu ller space of the once punctured torus then we have 1 e x 1 1 2 where x is the length of the geodesic with respect to x and the sum is over all simple closed geodesics on x proposition 5 let s 1 1 be the finite measure on p 1 m s 1 1 then s 1 1 x p 1 m s 1 1 sys x o log as 0 proof recall the computation from 9 showing how the volume of m 1 1 is com puted using theorem 4 in 6 vol m 1 1 2 0 f d 2 0 1 e d 2 6 in 8 mirzakhani showed that the earthquake invariant measure restricted to the space of unit length measured laminations is equal to the thurston volume of the unit ball in the space of measured laminations therefore we can compute the volume of the thin part of p 1 m s 1 1 with the help of the following claim claim there exist constants c 1 c 2 0 such that for any x t s 1 1 with sys x c 1 log th ml s 1 1 x 1 c 2 log proof of claim let be a systole of x the fenchel nielsen coordinate of x with respect to is for some let be a simple closed curve that intersects once then ml s has coordinate where is the algebraic intersection number with some fixed orientation the thurston volume can be computed by a double integral of the characteristic function of the unit ball in ml s 1 1 since the length of is linear with respect to its coordinate we can rewrite the integral in polar coordinates th ml s x 1 0 r 0 rdrd where r is the reciprocal of the length of the measured lamination with coordinate cos sin we can choose such that x is bounded between r and r where r is as defined in the proof of proposition 2 the length of the mea sured lamination cos sin is bounded between max r cos sin and r cos sin the integral 0 1 r cos sin 2 d is estimated by the standard method of breaking it into pieces at the points when r cos sin finally we estimate r by log 1 when is small cusp excursions for the earthquake flow 7 that finishes the proof of the claim finally we consider the integral below and standard computation will complete the proof 0 1 e 1 log d o log as 0 the following proposition is the result of a standard argument using the borel cantelli lemma along with the volume of the thin part as stated in proposition 5 recall the easier part of the borel cantelli lemma theorem 6 borel cantelli lemma let x f be a probability space where x is the sample space f is a set of events and is a probability measure let xn x 0 1 be a sequence of random variables with x x xn x 1 pn if n 1 pn then n 1 xn 0 proposition 7 let s s 1 1 and t n be any fixed sequence of real numbers for almost every x t s mf s we have lim sup n log sys et n x logn 1 where sys is the systole function and et n is the earthquake function for time t n proof we use the setting where x is p 1 m s 1 1 is s 1 1 and f is the set of measurable sets let yn be random variables defined by log sys et n the value yn log stands for the measure of the set of points x in p 1 m s 1 1 such that the systole length is shorter than after earthquaking by time t n in the direction using the fact that the measure is invariant under earthquake flows and proposition 5 yn log o log as 0 let rn be a sequence of positive real numbers and xn 1 yn rn 0 otherwise our goal is to show that the limsup of yn logn is bounded above by the definition of limsup it suffices to show that for all 0 and almost every x yn 1 logn for only a finite number of n this follows from setting rn 1 log n and applying theorem 6 a quick computation shows that n 1 pn n 1 yn 1 logn n 1 o n 1 1 log n hence n 1 xn 0 which is equivalent to n 1 xn 1 and this implies that the limsup of yn logn is bounded above by 1 almost everywhere 8 ser wei fu remark it is important to note that t n is a sequence chosen prior to the almost everywhere property for example a constant sequence would satisfy the upper bound trivially for every x the choice of t n n were used in classical logarithmic law papers 5 10 and we will show that the same choice does not hold for the earthquake flow 5 main theorem we now prove the main theorem the general notation is as in the proof of proposition 3 theorem 1 let s be the once punctured torus or the four punctured sphere for almost every x p 1 m s with respect to s we have lim sup t log sys et x t proof we consider with irrational slope and a sequence n with n x 1 n let be a closed geodesic that realizes sys x and m for some m n large enough recall from the proof of proposition 3 that for each fixed 0 t 0 and m n t there exists a finite sequence xj j 0 k that are candidates along et x 0 t t that have small systole length the candidates are described by their fenchel nielsen coordinates with respect to m that corresponds with the sequence of rational twists pj qj j 0 k arising as convergents finally for each rational twist there is a corresponding time hence we have a sequence tj j 0 k proposition 2 shows that log sys etj x is approximately x 2 qj to finish the proof it suffices to estimate tj for almost every x for the earthquake flow et x x 1 we have tj t 0 pj qj p 0 q 0 x 2 where t 0 corresponding to x 0 could be negative the factor of x 2 is the result of our normalization of the twist parameter and the weight on the value of t 0 is bounded by half the maximum time that realizes the systole length along the earthquake flow we use t 1 t 0 as an upper bound for t 0 recall that by construction for qj 6 1 pj qj is a convergent of p 0 q 0 to be more specific if p 0 q 0 is a 0 a 1 a 2 an in the usual convention of continued fraction expansion then pj qj is a 0 a 1 a 2 ah j where h j is equal to n 2 j or n 2 j 1 since only the odd convergents are greater than p 0 q 0 again using properties of continued fractions from 4 and notation from the proof of proposition 3 we have the following bound that compares convergents pj qj p 0 q 0 1 ah j 1 q 2 j combining our approximations above first we have log sys etj x tj x 2 qj t 1 2 j cusp excursions for the earthquake flow 9 next we use tj tj t 0 t 0 to obtain x 2 qj t 1 2 j x 2 qj x 2 ah 1 1 q 2 1 x 2 ah j 1 q 2 j 1 2 we use the fact that q 1 and x are much larger than qj to simplify log sys etj x tj 1 2 qj x 1 ah 1 1 q 1 qj 2 1 ah j 1 1 2 into log sys etj x tj 1 2 ah j 1 for j large enough and for some small as m goes to infinity the slope of m with respect to the chosen basis converges to some irrational number s the slope of recall that p 0 q 0 depends on x and a choice of a systole curve as a function of m p 0 q 0 converges to some value s in fact for any fixed j the sequence pj qj converges to as m this comes from the observation that any finite sequence pj m qj m kj 1 is a finite subsequence of the convergents of for m large enough by choosing t arbitrarily large and arbitrarily small we get lim sup t log sys et x t lim sup j 1 2 ah j 1 where an is the partial quotients of the right hand side is infinity for almost every real number the final step is to analyze the function r r that depends only on x and a choice of a systole curve rational slopes would be mapped to the rational twists in the sense of p 0 q 0 with respect to m to be explicit suppose that m a b c d and a b p 0 q 0 the value of q 0 is equal to the intersection number of a b and c d that is q 0 ad bc the value of p 0 depends on x since it is related to the choice of twist parameter the function is a continuous bijection over the rational numbers and irrational numbers are mapped by continuity for any integer q we consider the set of integer pairs a b such that ad bc q for c d fixed this set is mapped to the set p q under hence the derivative of is controlled by the choice of c d which is based on a choice of basis for 1 s 1 1 in an open neighborhood of a fixed x we can pick a suitable choice of basis for the fundamental group of s 1 1 so that is an absolutely continuous function over the set of slopes for in the neighborhood this implies that sets of full measure are mapped to sets of full measure under therefore for almost every slope s s satisfies lim sup j ah j 1 s therefore by applying fubini s theorem to the measure of the set of x such that c t we obtain that lim sup t log sys et x t for almost every x p 1 m s with respect to s 10 ser wei fu the special cases when is equal to the golden ratio or when the tail of the continued fraction expansion is all 1 s give us the corollary below corollary 8 for all x p 1 m s lim sup t log sys et x t 3 2 4 1 1 5 2 if and only if has irrational slope furthermore the inequality is sharp proof if has rational slope then lim sup t log sys et x is a constant that depends only on x for irrational we consider and its continued fraction expansion am bm the value of c t is larger for faster growing bm s i e faster decreasing qj s we can focus on the case when is equal to the golden ratio since it is the irrational number with the slowest possible growth of bm we estimate c t similar to the steps in the proof of theorem 1 we use two properties of pj qj p 0 q 0 1 qj qj 2 1 qj 2 qj 4 where the last term is either 1 q 0 q 2 or 1 q 0 q 1 the ratio between values of qj is controlled lim m bm c bm c combining the approximations all together we have log sys etj x tj x 2 qj x 2 j 2 i 1 1 q 2 j 2 4 i 2 1 2 j 1 4 as qj s and j become larger we get our desired result for lim sup t log sys et x t 3 2 4 1 references
