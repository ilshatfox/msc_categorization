models such as those involving abrupt changes in the earth s reflectivity due to ice melt and formation often use nonlinear terms e g hyperbolic tangent to model the transition between two states for various reasons these models are often approximated by simplified discontinuous piecewise linear systems that are obtained by letting the length of the transition region limit to zero the smooth versions of these models may exhibit equilibrium solutions that are destroyed as parameter changes transition the models from smooth to nonsmooth using one such model as motivation we explore the persistence of local behavior around saddle equilibria under these transitions we find sufficient conditions under which smooth models with saddle equilibria can become nonsmooth models with zombie saddle behavior and analogues of stable and unstable manifolds persist 1 introduction one of the fundamental concepts in the analysis of smooth dynamical systems is the idea of local behavior however varying a parameter can transform a smooth system into one that is nonsmooth and nonsmooth systems often have local behavior that is not observed in smooth systems indeed in many nonsmooth systems even the standard uniqueness theorem does not apply in this paper we analyze persistence of saddle like behavior in nonsmooth systems we conclude that if a saddle equilibrium disappears as a result of the system becoming nonsmooth and not in the case of a standard smooth bifurcation saddle behavior will in some sense remain in the nonsmooth system we show that the saddle equilibrium in the smooth system limits to a nonsmooth pseudoequilibrium which is an equilibrium of a filippov flow this pseudoequilibrium is accompanied by stable and unstable manifolds that are analogous to their smooth counterparts we call the new pseudoequilibrium point a zombie saddle and say the system has zombie saddle behavior 1 school of mathematics university of minnesota minneapolis mn 55455 2 department of

arxiv org abs 1504 04671 v 1 2 j leifeld k hill and a roberts the system given by x p x h x 0 q x h x 0 where p x and q x are smooth functions is an illustrative example of a nonsmooth system notice that the dynamics on the manifold where h x 0 remain undefined this manifold where h x 0 is called the discontinuity boundary or splitting manifold and the system is said to be a piecewise smooth system we are particularly interested in relating the dynamics of a smooth system to those of a nonsmooth approximation to the system obtained through some limiting process conceptual climate models have been formulated using nonsmooth systems dating back at least to stommel s thermohaline circulation model in 1961 over the last decade the use of nonsmoth systems has become increasingly popular with 1 2 5 6 10 11 13 all discussing conceptual climate models that are either nonsmooth or exhibit nonsmooth behavior in some limit in particular a nonsmooth approximation is often used for the basic energy balance equation 1 dt dt q 1 t a bt the albedo function t measures the reflectivity of the earth s surface it is generally assumed to transition from a high albedo at low temperatures due to large quantities of ice to a low albedo at high temperatures the transition is often modeled using a hyperbolic tangent 2 t i w 2 i w 2 tanh t t 0 d d measures how rapidly the transition from high to low albedo occurs in the limit d 0 the transition is instantaneous and is discontinuous in 1 the dependence on greenhouse gas concentration is built into the parameter a with smaller a indicating more greenhouse gases however especially on the time scales of paleoclimatic phenomena like snowball earth a should not be treated as a constant 13 22 introducing a as a possibly slow dynamic variable gives the system t q 1 t a bt a ma nt c 3 where m n 0 4 for certain parameter values the system has three equilibria see figure 1 a however as d 0 the middle equilibrium disappears as illustrated in figure 1 b in the case when the smooth system is bistable and the middle equilibrium is a saddle the stable manifold to the saddle forms the boundary of the basin of attraction of the two stable equilibria corresponding to stable climates in the context of nonsmooth systems there has been significant interest in the behavior of systems as they transition from smooth to nonsmooth for a more in depth treatment of the recent developments in the dynamics of nonsmooth systems we refer the reader to the surveys by colombo et al 7 and makarenkov et al 18 as a system with multiple time scales transitions from smooth to nonsmooth a technique called pinching has been proposed as a method of preserving dynamics of the smooth system in the nonsmooth limit 20 8 on the other hand techniques such as blow up and regularization use geometric singular perturbation theory to approximate the behavior in saddle behavior in the nonsmooth limit of smooth systems 3 a b figure 1 nullclines of 3 when m n 1 q 300 i 0 8 w 0 2 t 0 290 b 4 c 1300 a shows the case for d 5 and b shows the limit as d 0 with the splitting manifold t t 0 dashed red line notice the middle equilibrium from a is no longer an equilibrium in b the discontinuity boundary of a nonsmooth system as the system is smoothed 21 16 this process is similar to the blow up method used by jeffrey 15 except in 15 more complicated dynamics are allowed to occur in the blown up splitting manifold nonsmooth systems in which an equilibrium collides with a discontinuity boundary as a param eter varies are said to undergo a border collision bifurcation 9 17 19 however the interaction between an equilibrium colliding with a discontinuity boundary as the system itself is limiting to a nonsmooth limit is not well understood smooth systems that limit to a nonsmooth variant as some parameter varies have held recent interest notably in the context of climate dynamics 23 3 10 24 in this paper we specifically study systems with saddle equilibrium points that disappear in a traditional sense as the system becomes nonsmooth by this we mean that the equilibrium limits to the nonsmooth boundary as a 0 and hence is not a place where the vector field defined in the system is 0 before completing the analysis we first define some syntax in section 2 in section 3 we state and prove the main results of the paper we consider three cases of systems along with their nonsmooth limits a system that has no sliding region in the nonsmooth limit a system with a repelling sliding region and a system with an attracting sliding region in all cases we prove the existence of saddle equilibria in the systems throughout the limiting process additionally we show show that the saddle behavior persists in the limit we call these persistent pseudoequilibria zombie saddles because they are the remnants of real saddle equilibria from the smooth systems then in section 4 we provide examples of systems which exhibit this type of behavior we conclude in section 5 with a discussion of our results 4 j leifeld k hill and a roberts 2 nonsmooth analysis techniques our analysis uses the standard syntax of nonsmooth systems for simplicity we will assume there is a unique c 1 splitting manifold of codimension 1 then we can define a scalar function h x rn r with h x 0 along the manifold in the regions where the system is smooth we let f x be the vector field where h x 0 and define f x similarly let be a step function defined 1 h x 0 0 h x 0 then as in 12 the entire system can be written in the form of a convex combination of the vector fields x f x f x h x 0 f x h x 0 f x 1 f x 4 a sliding solution exists along the nonsmooth boundary if the following system can be solved for 0 1 5 s f x h x 0 h x 0 in a filippov system solutions to 5 are only possible in regions where the dot product f f 0 intuitively one would expect sliding solutions here as solutions should cross the splitting manifold when the vector fields point in the same direction therefore sliding regions are defined as regions along the splitting manifold where f f 0 the boundaries of the sliding region are then places where either vector field is tangent to the splitting manifold or more formally when f h 0 a tangency in f is called visible if a solution through the tangent point exists entirely in f and is invisible if the solution exists entirely in f corresponding definitions exist for tangencies in f the stability of the sliding solution is determined by the sign of d d s along h x 0 with d d s 0 indicating a stable sliding region alternatively d d s 0 indicates that the sliding region is unstable see figure 2 for an illustration of attracting and repelling sliding regions recent work by jeffrey has expanded on this method by using the idea that convex combinations of f and f are not necessary to the analysis 15 for example adding nonlinear terms of the parameter such as 1 which are zero away from the nonsmooth boundary also gives a method of finding sliding solutions which are beyond the scope of the standard filippov analysis these solutions can exist in regions for which the vector field points in the same direction and hence one would not expect sliding solutions to avoid these difficulties in this paper saddle behavior in the nonsmooth limit of smooth systems 5 we assume the nonsmooth functions can be written linearly with respect to in other words we let ga x be a smooth monotonically increasing function and as a approaches 0 ga x approaches g 0 x with 6 g 0 x g x x 0 g x x 0 it is possible to define g 0 0 based on a pointwise convergence of ga 0 however this precludes the possibility of any dynamic behavior along the splitting manifold which may be indicated by real behavior in the application system therefore we instead use the nonsmooth analysis conventions previously described and also assume g 0 x g x 1 g x it is important to note the breakdown of uniqueness of solutions in sliding regions of nonsmooth systems several initial conditions can generate solutions that approach the nonsmooth boundary in either forward or backward time and intersect in figure 2 a solutions are nonunique in backward time on the other hand in figure 2 b solutions are nonunique in forward time that is only one solution trajectory can enter the sliding region from either the right hand or left hand side but a family of solutions leaves the sliding region from both sides hence uniqueness in both forward and backward time is not to be expected in these systems however as we will see in section 3 it may still be possible to choose unique trajectories which correspond to stable and unstable manifolds 3 results in this section we prove the persistence of saddle equilibria in three distinct cases when the sliding region is stable unstable or nonexistent in each case we prove the existence of saddle equilibria in the smooth systems as well as saddle psuedoequilibria in the corresponding nonsmooth systems we also prove that stable and unstable manifolds persist in some form 3 1 no sliding solutions theorem 3 1 let ga x g x a a 6 0 be a monotonically increasing smooth function such that ga x g 0 x as a 0 with g 0 x g x x 0 g x x 0 where g and g are smooth functions up to the boundary x 0 furthermore assume g 0 g x 1 g x where 1 x 0 0 x 0 finally let g 0 f 0 g 0 where f is a smooth function then when 0 a 1 the system 7 x y f x y ga x y 6 j leifeld k hill and a roberts contains a saddle equilibrium point pa xa ya such that xa 0 as a 0 when a 0 the nonsmooth system contains a pseudoequilibrium on the splitting manifold x 0 and stable and unstable manifolds exist locally proof first we look at the case a 6 0 equilibrium solutions are found by solving f x ga x 0 consider an arbitrarily small interval around x 0 let d f 0 g 0 0 choose x 1 0 such that f x 1 f 0 d 3 g 0 g x 1 d 3 it is possible to choose this x 1 because of the continuity of f and g then choose a a 1 6 0 such that g x 1 ga x 1 d 3 a b figure 2 typical phase diagrams for nonsmooth systems with sliding regions with a attracting sliding and b repelling sliding in a trajectories may enter the sliding region at any point along the line between the dot and the square while in b trajectories may only enter the sliding region at the dot from the left and at the square from the right saddle behavior in the nonsmooth limit of smooth systems 7 this small a exists because of the pointwise convergence of ga we show that f x 1 ga x 1 0 f x 1 ga x 1 f 0 g 0 g 0 g x 1 f x 1 f 0 g x 1 ga x 1 d d 0 a similar argument works for x 2 0 therefore we conclude by the intermediate value theorem that f x ga x 0 for some x x 2 x 1 to see that this equilibrium is a saddle it is convenient to make a change of variables which is valid for all a 6 0 let x a then the system becomes 1 a y f a y g y the jacobian of this system is j f a 1 a g 1 with detj f a 1 a g because g is monotone increasing we know g 0 thus it is immediately clear that for sufficiently small a detj 0 when a 0 the system is discontinuous and the splitting manifold is the line x 0 the boundaries of the filippov sliding region occur where y f 0 given that f is a function there is only one point at which this occurs meaning that there is no linear sliding region this point is a pseudoequilibrium of the filippov flow as the vector fields on either side of the splitting manifold are colinear and opposite here it is easy to check that the the tangency is visibile on each side as seen in figure 3 a furthermore we can show the existence of trajectories through this tangency first we consider the system defined where x 0 and the case f 0 0 let y f 0 then because f 0 g 0 there is a region x 0 y f 0 f 0 for which y 0 moreover because f x 0 x 0 in this region this implies that there are no strictly invariant sets in the region and therefore every point can be taken continuously to the left and upper edges of the boundary using the map defined by the flow in particular there is a trajectory in this set which maps to 0 f 0 the tangency point under the flow this trajectory is an analogue of a stable manifold along which the equilibrium can be reached in finite time because 0 f 0 is a tangency of the vector field when x 0 the trajectory remains in the x 0 region and the portion which approaches 0 f 0 in backward time likewise acts as an analogue of an unstable manifold if f 0 0 we can make a similar argument after reversing time then there is a region x 0 y f 0 f 0 for which x 0 and y 0 this implies the existence of in initial condition in this region which approaches the tangency 0 f 0 in backward time with respect to the original system this trajectory will remain in the region x 0 for the same reason and acts as an analogue to stable and unstable manifolds the same arguments can be made for the existence of a trajectory through 8 j leifeld k hill and a roberts the tangency in the region x 0 thus in the full system trajectories through the double tangency are not unique much like a saddle there are two trajectories approaching the point and two trajectories leaving these trajectories function as stable and unstable manifolds to a saddle point especially in their role as separatrices much like stable and unstable manifolds their intersection consists of one point however in this case that point is reachable in finite time see figure 3 b for an illustration of this idea where the dark green boxes represent the boundaries of the flow in the regions discussed a b figure 3 a example phase diagram of the nonsmooth limit of 7 with f x 2 x 0 4 and ga x tanh x a so that g 0 x 1 blue curves represent the trajectories that have behavior similar to a stable manifold and red curves exhibit behavior similar to an unstable manifold the black points show the equilibria of the system dashed lines represent the nullclines of the system b an illustration of the visible tangency using f and g as defined in a the dashed lines show the nullclines of the system and the solid green lines give an illustration of the boxes considered in finding the tangency 3 2 a repelling sliding region theorem 3 1 under the assumptions in theorem 1 when 0 a 1 the system 8 x ga x y y f x y saddle behavior in the nonsmooth limit of smooth systems 9 contains a saddle equilibrium point xa such that xa 0 as a 0 when a 0 the nonsmooth system contains a stable pseudoequilibrium in a repelling sliding flow on the splitting manifold x 0 and stable and unstable manifolds exist locally proof again equilibria are determined by the equation f x ga x 0 an identical calculation to that in the proof of theorem 1 shows that an equilibrium solution exists in the calculation will not be repeated here doing the same convenient coordinate change as before we get a new system 1 a g y y f a y in this system the jacobian is j 1 a g 1 a af a 1 with detj f a 1 a g again we have that detj 0 giving us a saddle equilibrium the nonsmooth version of this system also shows saddle like behavior as ga x approaches a step function in the a 0 limit see figure 4 for an example of a phase diagram of 8 in this case tangencies to the discontinuity boundary occur when y g 0 and y g 0 implying that the sliding region has nonzero length moreover this sliding region is repelling which means that any solution starting on the sliding region will leave arbitrarily to see this we will use some formalism recall that g 0 x g x 1 g x we define h x y to be a scalar function such that h 0 when x 0 and h 0 when x 0 then sliding solutions exist where f x h 0 can be solved for some 0 1 along x 0 in this case it is clear that sliding solutions exist on g 0 g 0 as asserted previously moreover as in 15 stability of the sliding region can be determined by s x d d f h where s 0 implies an attracting sliding region and s 0 implies repelling in this example h x so f h g 0 y 1 g 0 y d d f h g 0 g 0 0 indicating repelling sliding we can also use this formulation to find the flow along the sliding region using 5 to solve for and plugging this solution into the original equations we get an equation for the flow y f 0 y it is clear that this has one stable equilibrium solution y f 0 10 j leifeld k hill and a roberts because the repelling sliding region has one stable equilibrium the system has behavior analogous to a saddle this saddle does not have unique trajectories acting as separatrices as section 3 1 instead a family of trajectories will move along the sliding region and each will leave the manifold at some point before it can reach the equilibrium however the sliding region itself might be considered analogous to a stable manifold for the same reasons as described in section 3 1 there is a unique trajectory on each side of the discontinuity which emanates from the equilibrium on the sliding region these two trajectories are analogous to an unstable manifold figure 4 example phase diagram of the nonsmooth limit of 8 with f x 2 x 0 4 and ga x tanh x a so that g 0 x 1 blue curves represent the tra jectories that have behavior similar to a stable manifold and red curves correspond to behavior similar to an unstable manifold the points show the equilibria of the system and the squares show where the sliding region begins ends dashed black lines represent the nullclines of the system 3 3 an attracting sliding region theorem 3 1 under the assumptions in theorem 1 when 0 a 1 the system 9 x y ga x y y f x contains a saddle equilibrium point xa with xa 0 as a 0 when a 0 the nonsmooth system contains an unstable pseudoequilibrium in a stable sliding region on the splitting manifold x 0 and stable and unstable manifolds exist locally saddle behavior in the nonsmooth limit of smooth systems 11 proof the system in theorem 3 is obtained by reversing time in the previous system so we need not repeat the proof that a saddle equilibrium exists and limits to x 0 the nonsmooth system again has two tangencies along the discontinuity line these occur at y g 0 and y g 0 the sliding region in this case is attracting because s x g 0 g 0 0 in this system the sliding flow is given by the equation y y f 0 from which it is again immediately clear that the sliding flow has one unstable equilibrium the equilibrium point is unstable but has no unique unstable manifold instead a family of trajectories will be attracted to the stable sliding region and then slide away from the unstable equilibrium the sliding region itself might again be considered as the analogue of the unstable manifold again there will be unique solutions to the equations on either side of the discontinuity which hit the sliding region exactly at the equilibrium of the sliding flow see figure 5 these trajectories arrive at the equilibrium in finite time and act as analogues to the stable manifold so again the nonsmooth system displays saddle behavior albeit slightly different from the saddles of the first two nonsmooth systems figure 5 example phase diagram of the nonsmooth limit of 9 with f x 2 x 0 4 and ga x tanh x a so that g 0 x 1 red curves represent the trajectories that have behavior similar to an unstable manifold and blue curves correspond to a stable manifold the points show the equilibria of the system and the squares show where the sliding region begins ends dashed black lines represent the nullclines of the system 12 j leifeld k hill and a roberts 4 examples 4 1 a nonsmooth system that exhibits all three saddles finally we find a nonsmooth system which displays all three types of saddle behavior in this example we let ga x tanh x a which limits to g 0 x 1 x 0 1 x 0 the smooth system is as follows where 0 x kga x x y y ga x y j 1 kg a xa 1 g a xa 1 and detj 1 k g a xa this means that for 0 fixed and k the conditions given previously for ga x again guarantee that the equilibrium xa is a saddle point the nonsmooth limit of the previous system is 10 x kg 0 x x y y g 0 x y where again g 0 x 1 x 0 1 x 0 2 1 if is defined as before tangencies to the discontinuity occur at y k 2 1 see figure 6 for illustrations of the phase diagram for this system for varied k for this system f h k 2 1 x y so d d s x 2 k and when k 0 the sliding region is repelling when k 6 0 the sliding flow in this system is given by y k 1 y the equilibrium occurs at y 0 and is stable if k which is true for any positive k similarly when k 0 the sliding region is attracting in this case the equilibrium is stable if k so in some region where k is small this is satisfied because of the division by k in the sliding flow the case where k 0 must be treated separately in this case the system is x x y y 2 1 y here tangencies occur when y x 0 so there is no sliding region instead as in section 2 1 we have saddle behavior through two visible tangencies occurring at the same point y 0 saddle behavior in the nonsmooth limit of smooth systems 13 a b c figure 6 example phase diagrams of 10 with 1 and a k 0 b k 0 and c k 0 as before red curves represent the trajectories that have behavior similar to an unstable manifold and blue curves exhibit behavior similar to a stable manifold the points show the equilibria of the system and the squares show where the sliding region begins ends dashed black lines represent the nullclines of the systems 4 2 energy balance model in this section we analyze the energy balance model 1 from the introduction we will reproduce the equations for reference t q 1 t a bt a ma nt c where t i w 2 i w 2 tanh t t 0 d as we will see the system has a repelling sliding region as d 0 the system is not quite in the same form as the system in theorem 2 as is however there is a change of variables by which it is possible the resulting system is no more enlightening than 1 is in its current form so we forgo the change of variables and analyze the system as is computing the jacobian gives 11 j q t b 1 n m and det j m q t b n the dependence of on t is through a hyperbolic tangent with a negative coefficient i w 2 in the limit as d 0 t limits to 12 0 t i if t t 0 w if t t 0 14 j leifeld k hill and a roberts define ai q 1 i bt 0 and define aw similarly if the a nullcline intersects the line t t 0 between ai and aw then figure 1 indicates there will be an equilibrium near t 0 at say t d that limits to t 0 as d 0 this occurs if ai n m t 0 c aw also in the d 0 limit the derivative of t d so for d small enough the equilibrium at t d will be a saddle as shown in figure 7 1 limits to a system with a repelling sliding region with an attracting critical point the two proper equilibria that remain in the nonsmooth system are fully attracting since at these points det j mb n 0 and tr j b m 0 thus the zombie saddle at t 0 serves as an unstable object between the two attracting equilibria figure 7 phase diagram of 3 in the nonsmooth limit parameter values are the same as in figure 1 i e m n 1 q 300 i 0 8 w 0 2 t 0 290 b 4 and c 1300 blue curves represent stable manifold like behavior red curves correspond to unstable manifold like behavior and the dashed lines represent the nullclines of the system the points show the equilibria of the system and the squares show where the sliding region begins ends 5 discussion it has been established that there are perils associated with using a nonsmooth approximation of a smooth dynamical system 14 and one might view this paper as yet another chapter of that cautionary tale after all a nonsmooth system may not even reflect the number of equilibrium points of the system it is supposed to approximate on the other hand we view this as highlighting similarities between certain smooth and nonsmooth systems in this case there is saddle behavior saddle behavior in the nonsmooth limit of smooth systems 15 in the nonsmooth system that mimics what is observed in the smooth system the saddle behavior is caused either by a double tangency along the splitting line as in 7 or by a an equilibrium of a sliding solution as in systems 8 and 9 we refer to the limiting points in the nonsmooth systems as having zombie behavior to reflect that even though the saddle equilibrium was destroyed the saddle behavior still exists in an altered state the recognition of the saddle behavior especially the existence of trajectories analogous to stable manifolds of a zombie saddle can be a useful tool for analyzing a dynamical system under certain parameters the motivating conceptual climate model 1 exhibits bistability in the smooth system there is a saddle point between the two attracting equilibria and the stable manifold of the saddle separates the basins of attraction of the stable equilibria analysis of this sort is standard in smooth systems the existence of a zombie saddle allows us to carry out similar analysis in the corresponding nonsmooth system future exploration may examine the manner in which un stable manifold of a saddle in the smooth system limits to the un stable manifold of the zombie saddle the computational difficulty in this endeavor arises because the zombie saddle is not truly an equilibrium and thus dynamics near the point are not described by its linearization therefore we cannot rely on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the linear system to provide the desired information in smooth systems if the stable manifold of a saddle is co dimension one then it forms a separatrix dividing phase space into regions with different dynamics for this reason it would be useful to find similar results for zombie saddles in higher dimensions where computing basins of attraction is generally more difficult acknowledgments we would like to thank mike jeffrey richard mcgehee and mary silber for their
