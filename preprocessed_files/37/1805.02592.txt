by a closed convex cone k hav ing nonempty interior y x y x k let x rn be a connected open set and a flow on x that is monotone for this order if y x and t 0 then ty ty theorem if periodic points of are dense in x then t is the identity map of x for some t 0 contents 1 introduction 1 terminology 2 2 resonance 4 3 proof of theorem 1 6 1 introduction many dynamical systems especially those used as models in applied fields are monotone the state space has an order relation that is preserved in positive time a recurrent theme is that bounded orbits tend toward periodic orbits for a sampling of the large literature on monotone dynamics consult the following works and the references therein 2 1 3 4 6 7 8 9 11 13 15 16 20 21 23 24 25 28 30 32 33 34 35 37 39 38 another common dynamical property is dense periodicity periodic points are dense in the state space often considered typical of chaotic dynamics this condi tion is closely connected to many other important dynamical topics such as struc tural stability ergodic theory hamiltonian mechanics smoothness of flows and diffeomorphisms the main result in this article theorem 1 is that a large class of monotone densely periodic flows t t r on open subsets of r n are globally periodic there exists t 0 such that t is the identity map i thank eric bach bas lemmens and januszmierczyn ski for helpful discussions 1 http arxiv org abs 1805 02592 v 3 terminology throughout this paper x and y denote topological spaces the closure of a subset of a space is s the group of homeomorphisms of x ish x z denotes the integers n the nonnegative integers andn the positive integers r denotes the reals q the rationals and q the positive rationals r n is euclidean n space every manifold m is assumed metrizable with empty boundary m unless otherwise indicated every map is assumed continuous unless otherwise described f x y means f maps x homeomorphically onto y the identity map of x is idx if f and g denote maps the composition of g following f is the map g f x 7 g f x which may be empty we set f 0 idx and recursivelydefine the k th iterate f k of f as f k f f k 1 k n the orbit of p under f is the set o p f k p k n denoted as o p f to record f when f x x the orbit of p x is defined as o p o p f p p o p a set a x is invariant under f if f a a f 1 a the fixed set and periodic set of f are the respective invariant sets f f x f x x p f n n f f n flows a flow t t r on y denoted formally by y is a continuous action of the group r on y a family of homeomorphisms t y y such that the map r h y t 7 t is a homomorphism and the evaluation map ev r y y t x 7 t x 1 is continuous a set a y is invariant under if it is invariant under every t when this holds the restricted flow a on a has the evaluation map ev r a the orbit of y y under is the invariant set o y t y t r denoted formally byo y orbits of distinct points either coincide or are disjoint the periodic and equilibrium sets of are the respective invariant sets p t r f t e t r f t 2 denoted by p and e if is clear from the context points in e are called stationary the orbit of a nonstationary periodic point is a cycle the period of p y is r per p 0 provided p p e r min t 0 t p p the set of r periodic points is p r p r p p per p r when p is r periodic the restricted flow o p is topologically conjugate to the rotational flow on the topological circle r rz covered by the translational flow on r whose evaluation map is t x 7 t x the flow y is trivial if e y densely periodic if p is dense in y pointwise periodic if p y periodic if there exists l 0 such that l idy equivalently the homo morphism r h y factors through a homomomorphism of the circle group r lz order recall that a partial order on y is a binary relation on y that is re flexive transitive and antisymmetric in this paper all orders are closed the set u v y y u v is closed the trivial order is x y x y the pair y is an ordered space denoted by y if the order is clear from the context we write y x to mean x y if x y and x y we write x y and y x for sets a b y the condition a b means a b for all a a b b and similarly for the relations the closed order interval spanned by a b y is the closed set a b y y a y b and its interior is the open order interval a b we write a b to indicate a b an order cone k rn is a closed convex cone that is pointed contains no affine line and solid has nonempty interior k is polyhedral if is the intersection of finitely many closed linear halfspaces the k order denoted by k for clarity is the order defined on every subset of rn by x k y y x k for the k order on rn every order interval is a convex n cell a map f x y between ordered spaces is monotone when x x x f x y f x 3 when y is ordered and g y y is injective y has a unique induced order making g monotone every subspace s y is given the order induced by the inclusion map s y when this order is trivial s is unordered a flow on an ordered space is monotone iff the maps t are monotone it is easy to see that every cycle for a monotone flow is unordered this is the chief result theorem 1 assume h 1 k rn is an order cone h 2 x rn is open and connected h 3 x is k ordered h 4 the flow x is monotone and densely periodic then is periodic the proof will be given after results about various types of flows 2 resonance in this section y is an ordered space y is a monotone flow o y is the orbit of y under o y t is the orbit of y under t lemma 2 assume i pk and qk are seqences in y converging to y y ii o pk o qk k 1 then y e proof by i and continuity of we have lim k t pk lim k t qk t y t r 2 while ii and monotonicity of imply k n t r pk t qk 3 from i 2 3 and continuity of we infer y t y t r therefore monotonicity shows that ty y for all t r 4 rationality rational numbers play a surprising role in monotone flows theorem 3 assume r s 0 if p p r q p s p q and o p o q then r s is rational proof we have o p o q 4 because p q and every cycle in a monotone flow us unordered note that the restriction of s to the circle o p is conjugate to the rotation r 2 r s of the unit circle c r 2 through 2 r s radians arguing by contradiction we provisionally assume r s is irrational then the orbit of r 2 r s is dense in c 1 and the cojugacy described above implies o p o p r 5 since p q monotonicity r k p s k q q k n whence o p r q and 5 implies o p q 6 therefore o p o q by monotonicity 4 and monotonicity but this contradicts the hypothesis definition 4 a set s is resonant for the flow y if s y and u v s p e per u per v q it is easy to prove lemma 5 if s is resonant so is its orbit proposition 6 s is resonant provided there exists q s p e such that z s p e per z per q q 7 1 this was discovered in the 14 th century by nicole oresme see grant 10 kar 17 a short proof based on the pigeon hole principle is due to speyer 36 stronger density theorems are given in bohr 5 kronecker 19 and weyl 40 41 5 proof if u v s p e then per u per v per u per q per q per v which lies in q by 7 theorem 7 assume p q p e p q o p o q 8 then p q is resonant proof note that p z q o z o q 9 for if this is false there exists z p q such that o z o q whence monotonicity implies w o p w o z w w o q it follows that o p o q contrary to hypothesis resonance of p q now follows from equation 9 and theorem 3 with the parameters a p b q the next result will be used to derive the main theorem from the analogous reuslt for homeomorphisms theorem 9 theorem 8 assume y is resonant s 0 and ps then p p s proof we fix p ps and show that every q p lies p s if then q is stationary then q p s if q pr then r 0 and resonance implies sk rl with k l n since rq q we have t kq s k q r l q q and again q p s 3 proof of theorem 1 recall the statement of the theorem assume h 1 k rn is an order cone h 2 x rn is open and connected h 3 x is k ordered h 4 the flow x monotone and densely periodic 6 then is periodic the proof relies on two sufficient conditions for periodicity of monotone home omorphisms theorems 9 and 10 below definitions a homeomorphism t w w is densely periodic if p t is dense in w pointwise periodic if p t w periodic if t k idw for some k n the key to theorem 1 is this striking result theorem 9 b lemmens et al 22 assume h 1 h 2 h 3 then a monotone homeomorphism t x x is periodic provided it is densely periodic 2 we also use an elegant result from the early days of transformation groups theorem 10 d montgomery 26 27 a homeomorphism of a connected topo logical manifold is periodic provided it is pointwise periodic 3 lemma 11 is pointwise periodic proof since e p it suffices to prove that the restriction of to each compo nent of x e is pointwise periodic therefore we assume e let x x be arbitrary as p is dense lemma 2 and theorem 7 show there exist p q p such that the open set p q is connected and resonant and contains x therefore the open set y o p q which is invariant and connected is resonant by lemma 5 by theorem 8 there exists s 0 such that p s p y consequently s is densely periodic hence periodic by theorem 9 therefore x p theorem 1 follows from lemma 11 and theorem 10 references 1 r anguelov y dumont j lubuma mathematical modeling of sterile
