dense billiard trajectories part 1 george william tokarsky math department university of alberta august 20 2018 in a paper 1 from 1983 g a galperin examined the existance of non periodic and not everywhere dense billiard trajectories in various polygons and in particular in a right triangle the particular example that he gave involving a right triangle was based on a sequence of mirror images of an isosceles triangle abc with a b x which in this paper we will measure in degrees as in fig 1 and which had been accepted 1 3 to 9 for the last thirty years as the definitive example of the existance of a non periodic and not everywhere dense billiard trajectory in a triangle unfortunately that result turned out to be incorrect this was proved by the author in 2 the significance of this is that the question of whether every triangle indeed every isosceles triangle has only periodic or dense trajectories or trajectories that end at a vertex is still an open problem figure 1 we first repeat here the short proof in 2 using a similar but not the same notation as in galperin s original paper using the well known process of straightening out a billiard trajectory galperin s triangle example was con structed from 44 copies of isosceles triangle abc using a sequence of reflections as in fig 1 in which the first and last reflection is in side ac and all alternate reflections are in side ab and where a 22 b 22 and a 16 b 16 are parallel to the base a 0 b 0 points labelled ai bi ci li mi pi si all represent the same points a b c l m p s on triangle abc two parallel corridors through the inte rior of this tower of triangles were then formed first using the line c 1 c 22 and then introducing a parallel through c 16 and another parallel line through c 17 as shown this construction sets up an exchange of segments on pl in which ps ml and sl pm if the ratio of ps to sl which is the same as the ratio of the widths of the two corridors is irrational then any billiard trajectory within and parallel to the corridors would be non periodic and everywhere dense in the corridors but not everywhere dense in the given isosceles triangle since this ratio is a continuously differentiable function of the acute angle x of the 1 http arxiv org abs 1509 02609 v 1 isosceles triangle there would be an angle x for which this ratio is irrational provided this ratio is non constant however as it happens this ratio turns out to be a constant and in fact equals 1 2 for every value of the acute angle x for which the corridors can be formed to calculate this ratio note that the angle opposite the base ab and all its mirror images are labelled as c vertices we can then calculate the coordinates of every c vertex using a little trigonometry together with the algorithm one from section 6 and under the assumption that the distance between any two successive c vertices is one unit if we let the coordinates of c 1 be 0 1 then the coordinates of c 16 are sin 4 x 5 8 cos 2 x 3 cos 4 x of c 17 are sin 4 x 6 8 cos 2 x 3 cos 4 x and the coordinates of c 22 are sin 2 x sin 4 x 8 11 cos 2 x 3 cos 4 x now the line through s 0 and l 16 is exactly the line through c 1 and c 22 and has slope m 7 11 cos 2 x 3 cos 4 x sin 2 x sin 4 x and equation y mx 1 this means that the other two parallel lines have the same slope and then the ratio of the widths of the two corridors is the same as the ratio that is cut off by any transversal of the two corridors in particular if we extend the line segment c 17 c 16 and find its point of intersection d with the line c 1 c 22 we find that its coordinates are sin 4 x 1 msin 4 x and the distance from c 16 to d is 4 8 cos 2 x 3 cos 4 x msin 4 xwhich equals 1 since 3 8 cos 2 x 3 cos 4 x sin 2 x sin 4 x 7 11 cos 2 x 3 cos 4 x sin 4 x which can be verifed by multiplying out and using the trig identity 2 sinacosb sin a b sin a b figure 2 this means that the ratio of the widths of the two corridors is exactly 2 to 1 for every value of the acute angle x which is a constant rational number and thus galperin s example fails note we don t have to worry about the case where sin 2 x sin 4 x 0 as then the lines would be vertical and if the corridors could be formed which they can t the ratio would be 1 to 1 which is again rational one might then hope to salvage galperin s method by finding a different sequence of mirror images which produces an irrational ratio it turns out that this is also doomed to failure as all corridors that satisfy the conditions as in galperin s original paper produce a constant rational ratio as it is the purpose of this paper to eventually show 1 tower of mirror images of an isosceles triangle let triangle abc be isosceles with a b x and by convention oriented counterclockwise from a to b to c a sequence of mirror images in the sides of triangle abc will be called a tower if 1 every alternate mirror image is in side ab and 2 its first and last mirror image is in side ac or bc 2 any tower must then have an even number of triangles in it if we number the triangles consecutively the first or starting triangle will always be oriented coun terclockwise and so will every odd numbered triangle while every even numbered triangle will be oriented clockwise including the last triangle all successive mir ror images of a b and c will be called a b and c points successive c points will always be assumed to be one unit distance apart and are successively labelled c 1 we start at c 1 instead of c 0 to cn while the base ab and its mirror images are successively labelled a 0 b 0 to anbn this means the orginal triangle is labelled a 0 b 0 c 1 note that this indexing differs from that used by galperin observe that each c point has an unique label while the a and b points can have multiple labels for example if the first mirror image is in side ac then that side has the labels a 0 c 1 as well as the label a 1 c 1 any c point corresponding to a mirror image in ac will be called a black point and if it corresponds to a mirror image in bc will be called a blue point each c point in the tower will have an unique color further the c points are in fact ordered in an increasing order that follows the ordering of the formation of the sequence of mirror images of the tower so i j if and only if ci was formed before cj in the sequence of mirror images figure 3 2 rhombus poolshots and rhombus towers again let triangle abc be isosceles with a b x and oriented counter clockwise from a to b to c given a finite billiard trajectory or poolshot we will call it a rhombus pool shot or rhombus billiard trajectory if 1 every alternate reflection is in the base ab 2 its first and last reflection is in side ac or bc and 3 it starts and finishes at side ab and doesn t hit a vertex if we straighten out this poolshot then we get a corresponding rhombus tower of mirror images with all a points occuring on one side and all b points occuring on the other side of the straightened poolshot called the associated rhombus poolshot now observe that the blue c points and the black c points are also on opposite sides of the straightened poolshot with all the blue points on the same side as all the a points and all the black points on the same side as all the b points and it follows that the convex hull of the blue c points and the convex hull of the black c points are disjoint this further means we cannot have a blue black blue collinear situation where a black point is between two blue points similarly we cannot have a black blue black collinear situation caution a rhombus tower is a tower but a tower with property 3 above need not be a rhombus tower for example if the convex hulls of the blue and black points intersect this prevents any poolshot being associated with the tower 3 notice since the poolshot starts at ab if we straighten it out upwards in standard position with the base ab placed horizontal with a to the left of b and c above the base then all a points and blue c points are on the left side and all b points and black c points are on the right side figure 4 convention any straightened rhombus poolshot can be viewed as forming the positive y coordinate axis in an xy coordinate system by introducing a perpendicular x axis through the starting point of the poolshot on side ab with this convention all a points will be on the left side and all b points will be on the right side of the poolshot 3 the non rhombus tower collinear test as previously noted given a finite tower if we have a blue black blue collinear situation with the black point between the two blue points or a black blue black collinear situation then no rhombus poolshot can create this tower of mirror images as the convex hulls of the blue and black points would not be disjoint vectorially if v a b is a non zero vector from the first blue point to the black point and w c d is a non zero vector from the black point to the last blue point the three points are collinear if and only if ad bc hence we get the the non rhombus tower collinear test a tower is not a rhombus tower if it has three collinear blue black blue or black blue black c points in that betweeness order or equivalently if ad bc where v a b is a vector from the first c point to the second and w c d is a vector from the second to the third c point as there would be no associated rhombus pool shot note that if the three c points are in the correct betweeness order then a and c have the same sign and b and d have the same sign also observe that a 0 if and only if c 0 and similarly for b and d and that one of a and b is non zero and one of c and d is non zero 4 side sequences and codes since we will be dealing almost exclusively with rhombus billiard trajectories or rhombus poolshots in an isosceles triangle abc we need a compact notation to describe the successive sides that are hit the usual notation is to label the sides of triangle abc as follows ab 1 ac 3 and bc 2 then for example 13131212131 represents a side sequence of reflections in those respective sides we will use the convention that the first 1 tells us that the poolshot starts at side ab and the last 1 tells us that it ends at side ab and no further reflections are considered observe that no two consecutive integers are the same and since every alternate reflection is in the base ab then every alternate integer will be a 1 we will also use the same side sequence notation to describe the sequence of reflected images of triangle abc that form a tower which may or may not 4 be a rhombus tower according as to whether it is associated with a poolshot or not for example the tower in fig 5 with x 17 degrees is described by the side sequence 1313131313131 and isn t a rhombus tower we make a similar convention as above that the first 1 just represents that first appearance of triangle abc and not a reflection and the last 1 represents the last appearance of triangle abc and not a reflection figure 5 the notation can become cumbersome to read if we are dealing with a long side sequence of reflections for example 131312121213131312121313121312131 hence we introduce its corresponding code sequence 4 6 6 4 4 2 2 2 2 or 4 62 42 24 in exponential code the first integer 4 represents how many times 1 and 3 are switched at the start the second integer 6 then represents the following number of succesive switches of 1 and 2 the third integer 6 then represents the following number of succesive switches of 1 and 3 and so forth alternately the code notation can be gotten from the side sequence notation by successively counting the number of 3 s then the number of 2 s then the number of 3 s and so forth and then multiplying by two to get the code sequence important comment the sequence of code numbers divided by two repre sents the successive number of black and blue points or blue and black points as they alternate in the tower for the example above there are 2 black points followed by 3 blue points 3 black points and so forth convention if we use exponential code and if the exponent is 0 this means that the code number does not appear for example 4 60 42 24 is just 43 24 in exponential code if the base is zero this also means the code number does not appear for example 0 60 02 24 is just 24 observe that if the side sequence starts 13 then given its code sequence we can recover the original side sequence by starting the sequence with 13 if we choose to recover the side sequence by starting it with 12 then we will recover it with the 3 s and 2 s interchanged this is not a problem as it just represents a relabeling of the sides of triangle abc also observe that since a rhombus poolshot starts and ends with ab then its code sequence consists of all even integers as with side sequences we can also use a code sequence to describe a tower of mirror images of triangle abc be it a rhombus tower or not we will make the convention that if there are three dots in front of a code sequence or following a code sequence then this means there is at least one code number preceding or following that code sequence in which case we will call it a subcode for example 2 4 is a subcode of the code sequence 2 2 4 4 corresponding to any subcode there is a sequence of mirror images of triangle abc which is a tower in its own right and which we will call a subtower 5 5 corridor towers now take a rhombus tower of mirror images of triangle abc that starts with half a rhombus the isosceles triangle abc and finishes with half a rhombus and which has n 1 rhombi in between and which involves 2 n copies of triangle abc in order to form the corridors as in galperin s paper the following three conditions must also be satisfied 1 the first reflection is in side a 1 c 1 a 0 c 1 and the last reflection is in side ancn 2 anbn must be parallel to a 0 b 0 and that there must exist a special integer m with 0 m n such that ambm is also parallel to a 0 b 0 and such that the 2 m 1 st reflection is in side cmbm and the 2 m 1 st reflection is in side cm 1 bm 1 we can then form corridors as follows the first or right corridor is formed by taking the line c 1 cn and extending it to hit a 0 b 0 at s 0 ambm at lm and anbn at mn the line s 0 mn then forms a right boundary line of the first corridor the other left boundary line of the first corridor p 0 qn is formed by introducing a parallel line through cm and extending it to hit a 0 b 0 at p 0 ambm at mm and anbn at qn now introduce a third parallel through cm 1 hitting ambm at sm and anbn at pn and form the second wider corridor with boundary lines smpn and lmmn we will also call the corridor with boundary lines smpn and mmqn the left corridor 3 finally the first and second corridors must have positive width with the width of the second corridor larger than the first and the corridors must go through the interiors of the sequence of mirror images of triangle abc and have no vertices between their boundary lines although there can be and are vertices on their boundary lines if a rhombus tower satisfies all three conditions we will call it a corridor rhombus tower or corridor tower it is worth noting that any associated rhombus poolshot that creates the rhombus tower need not be parallel to the boundary lines or sides of the corridors if they exist but can always be taken to be so and henceforth we will assume that is the case also note that if the corridor tower is placed in standard position with base a 0 b 0 horizontal and the straightened pool shot going upwards then it must have positive slope leans to the right otherwise we would not have been able to form the second corridor also observe that c 1 and cn are black points while the special c points cm and cm 1 are blue points and if the corridor tower is in standard position then all the c points to the right of the associated parallel rhombus poolshot are black points and all the c points to the left are blue points the original galperin example composed of 44 copies of triangle abc can be described by the side sequence 131212121313131312121212131313121213131212131 or 2 6 8 8 6 4 4 4 2 in code observe that the sum of the code numbers gives us the number of triangles involved the jth integer in a code sequence is called the jth code number below fig 6 is another example of a corridor tower 131212121313131212131 or 2 6 6 4 2 composed of 20 triangles which will turn 6 out to be the shortest corridor tower and in which the ratio of the widths is also 2 to 1 for every angle x for which the corridors can be formed this will eventually be proved in the classification theorem figure 6 the subtower containing the corridor from the segment p 0 s 0 to the segment mmlm where m is the special integer will be called the first level and subtower containing the wider corridor from the segment smlm to the segment pnmn will be called the second level note that if we consider each level separately then each level starts with ab and ends with ab and is a tower in its own right and we can use our code notation to describe each level the first level is a tower whose first reflection is in side ac and last reflection is in side bc while the second level is a tower whose first reflection is in side bc and last reflection is in side ac figure 7 a and 7 b fact 1 if a corridor tower or rhombus tower has 2 n in its code where x a b then 0 x 90 n proof since then the straightened pool shot must cross an angle of 2 nx which means that 2 nx 180 qed figure 8 now observe that the first level of a corridor tower is antisymmetric which here means that if we look at its side sequence and interchange the 2 s and the 3 s and reverse its order then we get exactly the same side sequence since the ray mmcm leaves ambm at the same angle as the ray s 0 c 1 leaves a 0 b 0 similarily the second level is antisymmetric as an example the first level of the original corridor is 131212121313131312121212131313121 2 6 8 8 6 2 in code and its second level is 1213131212131 2 4 4 2 in code both of which read the same forwards and backwards if we interchange the 2 s and 3 s it follows that the code sequence of the first level and of the second level are both symmetric and each has an even number of even code numbers fact 2 aibj is parallel to akbl if there is the same number of blue points and black points between the two line segments in particular this is the case if the sequence of code numbers between the two line segments is even and symmetric 6 algorithm one there is a nice algorithm that can be used to calculate the coordinates of the c points in a corridor tower or more generally any arbitrary tower in standard position assuming the coordinates of the first c point are 0 1 and that the distance between successive c points is exactly one unit starting at the base which has y coordinate 1 2 of the corridor tower and proceeding upwards count the number of black points then the number of blue 7 points and continue alternating in this manner as an example for the original corridor this gives us the sequence 1 3 4 4 3 2 2 2 1 which is exactly half of its code sequence 2 6 8 8 6 4 4 4 2 we can now form the corresponding vertical array of integers as follows and illustrated below 1 the first line in the vertical array which we call a black line because it consists wholly of black points is the integer 0 which represents the first black point c 1 and we assign it the coordinates 0 1 or sin 0 cos 0 2 the color of the points in a line alternately changes from black to blue or from blue to black as we go from one line in the array to the next line for black lines consecutive integers decrease by 2 and for blue lines they increase by 2 throughout that line and this continues on to the first integer on the next line after which it switches from increasing to decreasing or vice versa 3 the jth code number divided by 2 indicates the number of integers on the jth line which we call its length which for this example gives us the successive lengths 1 3 4 4 3 2 2 2 1 4 the ith integer in this array reading from up to down and from left to right represents the point ci and has coordinates x y where x is a sum of the form a 1 sin 2 x a 2 sin 4 x atsin 2 tx aksin 2 kx a 0 sin 0 x a 1 sin 2 x a 2 sin 4 x atsin 2 tx aksin 2 kx where the coeffi cient of sin 2 tx is calculated by counting up the number of times the integer 2 t appears with a plus sign minus the number of times it appears with a negative sign in the array up to and including the integer representing ci similarily y is a sum of the form a 0 a 1 cos 2 x a 2 cos 4 x atcos 2 tx akcos 2 kx a 0 cos 0 x a 1 cos 2 x a 2 cos 4 x atcos 2 tx akcos 2 kx where the coeffi cient of cos 2 tx is calculated by counting up the number of times the integer 2 t appears in the array irregardless of its sign up to and including the integer representing ci in our example we get the following vertical array 0 black line 2 0 2 blue line 4 2 0 2 black line 4 2 0 2 blue line 4 2 0 black line 2 0 blue line 2 0 black line 2 0 blue line 2 black line note 1 we have starred the integers corresponding to c 1 c 16 c 17 and c 22 and we add a horizontal line whenever a line changes its length or whenever its length is unknown we used this algorithm to calculate the coordinates of these points at the beginning of this paper for example the coordinates of c 22 were found to be sin 2 x sin 4 x 8 11 cos 2 x 3 cos 4 x note 2 a vector between any two c points can easily be found by looking 8 at only the integers in the array between the two c points excluding the first c point and including the last c point and by counting as in step four above for example the vector from the third starred point to the fourth is given by sin 2 x 2 3 cos 2 x note 3 for any arbitrary tower the rules are the same as enumerated above with modifications as set out below a if it is in standard position the first integer 0 in the array can be a black or a blue point b we may also choose to start the vertical array with any even integer 2 n positive or negative in which case the coordinates of the first c point which can be black or blue will be considered to be set at sin 2 nx cos 2 nx and this would correspond to a tower which is not in standard position if 2 nx is not a multiple of 360 below is an example of the tower above where the first c point has coordinates sin 2 x cos 2 x a vector from the third starred point to the fourth is now given by 2 sin 2 x sin 4 x 2 2 cos 2 x cos 4 x 2 black line 4 2 0 blue line 2 0 2 4 black line 6 4 2 0 2 0 2 4 2 0 2 4 2 blue line 0 black line c we can also recoordinatize the c points by subtracting a constant vector u v from the coordinates of every c point in this way the first c point can be considered to start with any pair of coordinates it is important to observe however that this will not change any relationships between the vectors for example parallel vectors will still be parallel note 4 given isosceles triangle abc and a fixed angle x then there is a one to one correspondence between code sequences of even positive integers and towers of triangle abc whose first reflection is in side ac and similarly if its first reflection is in side bc in other words the code sequence determines an unique tower and the code sequence can be taken as its name further the code sequence determines an unique vertical array once the first even integer and its color has been chosen 7 tests we need to develop a sequence of useful tests and start with the following important fact if a vertical poolshot enters a rhombus ac 1 bc 2 say first at ac 1 and doesn t hit a vertex and crosses the diagonal ab then it leaves the rhombus at either ac 2 or bc 2 such that the y coordinate of vertex c 2 is greater than the y coordinate of vertex c 1 9 proof assume that the vertical pool shot goes through ac 1 as shown on the diagram and that ab has positive slope m 1 now since the diagonals are perpendicular the slope of c 1 c 2 is the negative reciprocal and the y coordinate must increase from c 1 to c 2 similarily if ab has negative or zero slope qed figure 9 consequence 1 given a straightened vertical rhombus pool shot in volving isosceles triangle abc then the y coordinates of the c points keep increasing as the pool shot moves upwards note if the rhombus poolshot as above is not vertical and we drop perpen diculars from the c points onto the straightened poolshot viewed as a positive coordinate axis then the location of the feet of the perpendiculars which we will still call the y coordinate of c increase as the pool shot moves forward see fig 10 also note that the pool shot can be considered as a vector and as it goes through the sequence of mirror images of triangle abc it induces an increasing order on them and also an increasing order on the c points this means that the c points are in fact labelled such that the y coordinate of ci is less than the y coordinate of cj if and only if i is less than j we will refer to ci as the lower c point and cj as the higher c point caution given a tower in standard position which is not a rhombus tower and with the usual ordering of the c points in the same order that they are formed by the sequence of reflections the y coordinates need not increase as the index i in ci increases figure 10 now observe that if we are given the two corridors in a corridor rhombus tower which we can assume is in standard position and if we form a vector v a b from the special blue point cm 1 to a higher blue c point and a vector w c d from the special blue point cm to a higher black c point note this means that b and d are both positive then the two vectors cannot be parallel see fig 11 now the two vectors are parallel if w kv where k d b and hence ka c which is equivalent to ad bc figure 11 this leads to the following test non corridor test 1 given a rhombus tower satisfying the first two corridor conditions and a vector v a b from the special blue point cm 1 to a higher blue c point which is parallel ad bc to a vector w c d from the special blue point cm to a higher black c point then the two corridors cannot be formed with all three requisite properties and it is not a corridor rhombus tower consequence 2 given a corridor rhombus tower and if we join the first black point c 1 or the last black point cn to any black point then no blue point can be collinear with those two in any order it follows that if we join c 1 10 or cn to any blue point no black point can be collinear with these two proof since the black and blue points are separated by the right corridor and since c 1 has the smallest y coordinate and cn has the largest and the y coordinates of the c points increase as its subscript increases qed figure 12 this gives the following test non corridor test 2 given a prospective corridor rhombus tower sat isfying the first condition in which there is a blue point collinear in any order with either the first black point c 1 or the last black point cn and another black point then the corridors cannot be formed with all three properties and it is not a corridor rhombus tower consequence 3 given a rhombus tower where ci is a blue point cj is a black point and ck is a blue point with i j k then the pool shot must go through the segment cicj first and then go through the segment cjck second proof since the y coordinates of the c points increase as the index in creases it follows that the y coordinate of every point on cicj is less than the y coordinate of every point on cjck and the result follows qed figure 13 this means that the orientation of the triangle cicjck in that order must be counterclockwise similarly if ci is a black point cj is a blue point and ck is a black point with i j k in which case the orientation of cicjck is clockwise non rhombus tower test 3 given a tower where ci is a blue point cj is a black point and ck is a blue point with i j k and if the orientation of triangle cicjck is clockwise or the three points are collinear then there is no rhombus poolshot and hence it is not a rhombus tower which further means it is not a corridor rhombus tower similarly if ci is a black point cj is a blue point and ck is a black point with i j k and the orientation of cicjck is counterclockwise or the three points are collinear then it is not a rhombus tower this is an important test for the non existance of the corridors and we can rephrase it using the well known algorithm that if the coordinates of ci are x 0 y 0 of cj are x 1 y 1 and of ck are x 2 y 2 then the orientation of triangle cicjck is counterclockwise if x 1 x 0 y 2 y 0 x 2 x 0 y 1 y 0 is positive and clockwise if negative if the difference is zero then the three points are collinear writing this in vector form we get the following non rhombus tower test 4 given a tower and a if we form a vector v a b from any blue point c to a higher black point c and another vector w c d from c to a higher blue point c and if the orientation cc c is clockwise or the points are collinear then there is no rhombus poolshot note this is the case if a b d b a c which is equivalent to ad bc 11 b alternately if we form a vector v a b from c to c and another vector u a c b d from c to c and if the orientation cc c is clockwise or the points are collinear then there is no rhombus poolshot if ad bc in either case it is not a rhombus or corridor rhombus tower if ad bc c similarly if we form a vector w c d from any black point c to a higher blue point c and another vector v a b from c to a higher black point c and if the orientation cc c is counterclockwise or the points are collinear which is then still equivalent to ad bc then there is no rhombus poolshot figure 14 indeed test 4 can be extended further to get non rhombus tower test 5 given a tower and if we take a vector v a b from a blue point c to a higher black point c and a vector w c d from a possibly different black point c to a higher blue point c and if the orientation of the triangle with coordinates 0 0 a b a c b d is clockwise or the triangle with coordinates 0 0 c d a c b d is counterclockwise then there is no rhombus poolshot in either case there is no rhombus poolshot if ad bc which means the tower is not a rhombus or corridor rhombus tower the version of the above where the points are collinear is treated separately below and can be extended to allow them to form parallel lines in the following way non rhombus tower test 6 given a code sequence of a tower and its corresponding vertical array which produces two parallel vectors pointing in the increasing direction such that one v a b is from a blue black point ci to a higher black blue point cj and the other w c d is from a black blue point ck to a higher blue black point cp then there is no rhombus pool shot and hence the tower is not a rhombus or corridor rhombus tower note the vectors are parallel if ad bc proof as the pool shot would have to go through one of them first say cicj and then ckcp second which would cause the two blue c s and the two black c s to be on opposite sides of the straightened poolshot which is impossible qed figure 15 combining the two tests we get non rhombus tower test 7 given a tower and if we take a vector v a b from a blue point c to a higher black point c and a vector w c d from a possibly different black point c to a higher blue point c and if ad bc then there is no rhombus poolshot which means the tower is not a rhombus or corridor rhombus tower as an example we can use test 6 to prove that the subcode 62 4 2 42 cannot occur in the code sequence of a rhombus poolshot proof consider the two starred points the first of which is blue and the 12 second one black and the two double starred points the first of which is black and the second one blue observe that since the integers between them are exactly the same excluding the initial points and including the terminal points the corresponding vectors must be parallel and also satisfy the conditions set out in test 6 hence no rhombus poolshot contains this code sequence observe that this array starts at 2 2 0 2 blue 4 2 0 black 2 0 2 black 0 2 4 2 0 blue qed non corridor test 8 given a rhombus tower satisfying the first two corridor conditions and a vector v a b from a lower blue point to the special blue point cm and a vector w c d from a lower black point to the last black point cn then the two corridors cannot be formed with all three requisite prop erties and it is not a corridor rhombus tower if ad bc observe that if we use the vectors v and w or the vectors v and w the test is the same proof since the triangle with coordinates p 0 0 q a b r a c b d cannot have clockwise orientation from p to q to r which is the case if ad bc qed figure 16 non corridor test 9 given a rhombus tower satisfying the first corridor condition and a vector v a b from any black point to a lower blue point and a vector w c d from the last black point cn to a lower black point then the two corridors cannot be formed with all three requisite properties and it is not a corridor rhombus tower if ad bc similarly if we use a vector v a b from the first black point c 1 to a higher black point and a vector w c d from any black point to a higher blue point then it is not a corridor rhombus tower if ad bc again if we use the vectors v and w or the vectors v and w the test is the same proof since the points with coordinates p 0 0 q a b r a c b d can not have clockwise orientation from p to q to r or be collinear which is the case if ad bc qed figure 17 finally observe that if in a corridor rhombus tower we take a vector v a b 13 from a lower blue point to the special blue point cm and a vector w c d from a lower black point to the last black point cn and if these two vectors are parallel then the line through cm with vector v and the line through cn with vector w are in fact along the boundary lines of the first corridor hence we get the following test locked in test given a fixed rhombus tower satisfying the first two corridor conditions and a vector v a b from a lower blue point ck to the special blue point cm and a vector w c d from a lower black point ck to the last black point cn and if v and w are parallel ad bc then all corridor rhombus towers ending with this same fixed rhombus tower all have the line through ck and cm and the line through ck and cn as the boundary lines of the first corridor we can equally use v and w or v and w note this means that in all such corridor rhombus towers the ratio of the widths of the two corridors is exactly the same figure 18 8 algorithm two to apply these tests is going to require that we check various trig identities or trig inequalities many of which will involve certain kinds of patterns of finite sums of sines and cosines to handle these we first reduce them to a shorter sum by the following algorithm given the sum a 0 a 1 cos 2 x a 2 cos 4 x a 3 cos 6 x akcos 2 kx step 1 multiply by 2 sinx and use the trig identity 2 sinxcos 2 nx sin 2 n 1 x sin 2 n 1 x this results in the sum 2 a 0 a 1 sinx a 1 a 2 sin 3 x a 2 a 3 sin 5 x ak 1 ak sin 2 k 1 x aksin 2 k 1 x which is of the form c 1 sinx c 2 sin 3 x c 3 sin 5 x cksin 2 k 1 x step 2 multiply by 2 sinx again and use the trig identity 2 sinxsin 2 n 1 x cos 2 n x cos 2 n 2 x to get c 1 c 2 c 1 cos 2 x c 3 c 2 cos 4 x ck ck 1 cos 2 k x ckcos 2 k 2 x to illustrate with an example if we start with the sum of k 1 terms in the pattern below 2 nk 2 n 1 4 nk 4 n 2 cos 2 x 4 nk 6 n 1 cos 4 x 4 nk 10 n 1 cos 6 x 6 n 1 cos 2 k 2 x 2 n 1 cos 2 kx it becomes at step one 2 n 1 sin 3 x 4 nsin 5 x 4 nsin 7 x 4 nsin 2 k 1 x 2 n 1 sin 2 k 1 x and then becomes at step two just a sum of four terms 2 n 1 cos 2 x 2 n 1 cos 4 x 2 n 1 cos 2 kx 2 n 1 cos 2 k 2 x which is exactly the original sum times 4 sin 2 x similarily given the sum d 1 sin 2 x d 2 sin 4 x d 3 sin 6 x dksin 2 kx 14 step 1 multiply by 2 sinx and use the trig identity 2 sinxsin 2 nx cos 2 n 1 x cos 2 n 1 x to get d 1 cosx d 2 d 1 cos 3 x d 3 d 2 cos 5 x dk dk 1 cos 2 k 1 x dkcos 2 k 1 x which is of the form e 1 cosx e 2 cos 3 x e 3 cos 5 x ekcos 2 k 1 x ek 1 cos 2 k 1 x step 2 multiply be 2 sinx again and use the trig identity 2 sinxcos 2 n 1 x sin 2 n 2 x sin 2 nx to get e 1 e 2 sin 2 x e 2 e 3 sin 4 x ek ek 1 sin 2 k x ek 1 sin 2 k 2 x example 2 nk 2 n 1 4 nk 4 n 2 sin 2 x 4 nk 6 n 1 sin 4 x 4 nk 10 n 1 sin 6 x 6 n 1 sin 2 k 2 x 2 n 1 sin 2 kx becomes at step one 2 nk 2 n 1 cosx 2 n 1 cos 3 x 4 n cos 5 x 4 n cos 7 x 4 n cos 2 k 1 x 2 n 1 cos 2 k 1 x and then becomes at step two just a sum of four terms 2 nk 2 sin 2 x 2 n 1 sin 4 x 2 n 1 sin 2 kx 2 n 1 sin 2 k 2 x which is exactly the original sum times 4 sin 2 x 9 useful trig identities the main trig identity 16 sin 4 x sin 2 kx sin 2 k 2 x sin 2 k 2 s x sin 2 k 4 x 3 sin 2 k 2 x 3 sin 2 kx sin 2 k 2 x sin 2 s 2 k 2 x 3 sin 2 s 2 k x 3 sin 2 s 2 k 2 x sin 2 s 2 k 4 x which can be proved using the identities 2 sinxsin 2 nx cos 2 n 1 x cos 2 n 1 x and 2 sinxcos 2 n 1 x sin 2 n 2 x sin 2 nx special cases 1 s 0 then 16 sin 4 xsin 2 kx sin 2 k 4 x 4 sin 2 k 2 x 6 sin 2 kx 4 sin 2 k 2 x sin 2 k 4 x 2 s 1 then 16 sin 4 x sin 2 kx sin 2 k 2 x sin 2 k 4 x 3 sin 2 k 2 x 2 sin 2 kx 2 sin 2 k 2 x 3 sin 2 k 4 x sin 2 k 6 x 3 s 2 then 16 sin 4 x sin 2 kx sin 2 k 2 x sin 2 k 4 x sin 2 k 4 x 3 sin 2 k 2 x 3 sin 2 kx 2 sin 2 k 2 x 3 sin 2 k 4 x 3 sin 2 k 6 x sin 2 k 8 x if sinx 6 0 another useful identity is sinz sin z 2 x sin z 4 x sin z 2 nx sin n 1 x sin z nx sinx as an example if we let z 4 x and replace n by 2 n this then becomes sin 4 x sin 6 x sin 4 n 2 x sin 4 n 4 x sin 2 n 1 x sin 2 n 4 x sinx this would be greater than zero if 0 2 n 4 x 180 and n 0 15 10 classification of all corridor towers in order to show that galperin s method can never work we must first classify all corridor towers this will take some work we start by first characterizing the second level of a corridor tower which is a rhombus tower all by itself recall as previously noted that any corridor in standard position must lean to the right as otherwise we would not be able to form the second level this means that the x coordinate of any black point other than the first which is set at zero must be greater than zero but this entails that the code sequence must start at 2 6 or higher if it started 2 2 the second black point would have x coordinate sin 2 x a negative value keeping in mind that x is an acute angle between 0 and 90 and if it started 2 4 the second black point would have x coordinate 0 this means the corridor must start 131212121 and then by antisymmetry the first level must end 131313121 figure 19 we can now use this to help us show that the second level is always of the code sequence form 2 42 k 2 for some integer k 0 we also make use of the following lemmas any rule prefaced by the word corridor indicates that it is about a corridor tower corridor lemma 1 the second level must start 1213 starts 2 in code and by antisymmetry the second level ends in 2131 ends 2 in code proof since the last reflection by definition is in side ac the second level ends 31 and by antisymmetry must then start 12 this means the second level starts 12 12 r 13 for some integer r 0 if r 0 then the line through cm 1 and cm r 1 which are blue points is parallel to the line through the blue point cm and the black point cm r 2 since both are perpendicular to the bisector of the angle cmbmcm r 2 of size 2 r 2 x at bm hence the corridor can t exist by non corridor test 1 and the second level must start 1213 qed figure 20 cor 1 this means the right or first corridor as it passes from the first level to the second level is of the form 131313121213 4 in code the next rule is a rule about rhombus poolshots any rule prefaced by the word rhombus indicates that it is about a rhombus poolshot or rhombus tower rhombus rule a the subcode 2 n 2 n 2 k where 2 n is not the first code number or 2 n 2 k 2 n where 2 n is not the last code number n 1 k 2 never appears in the code sequence of any rhombus pool shot caution this rule does not hold if 2 n is the first or last code number as can be seen from the existance of the corridor 2 6 6 4 2 in fig 6 proof suppose it does then since we are free to orient the corresponding sequence of mirror images of triangle abc however we want and since there is a code number preceding 2 n we can start with triangle abc in standard position and then follow that by a sequence of mirror images corresponding to the code 2 n 16 2 n 2 k now observe that the three c points which we have starred below are collinear shown below and since this is a black blue black collinear situation it is impossible by the non rhombus tower collinear test note that the second starred point lies between the other two since the y coordinates of the c points are increasing 0 black 2 0 2 4 2 n 6 2 n 4 blue 2 n 2 2 n 4 2 n 6 2 0 2 4 black using this vertical array a vector v a b from the first black starred point to the second starred blue point is sin 4 x sin 6 x sin 2 n 4 x 1 2 cos 2 x cos 4 x cos 6 x cos 2 n 4 x and a vector w c d from second starred blue point to the third starred black point is sin 6 x sin 2 n 4 x sin 2 n 2 x 1 2 cos 2 x 2 cos 4 x cos 6 x cos 2 n 4 x cos 2 n 2 x and the three points are collinear since ad bc there are special cases which we will do here but for other rules we may leave it to the reader if n 1 v sin 2 x cos 2 x and w sin 2 x sin 4 x 1 cos 2 x cos 4 x which are collinear since ad bc if n 2 v sin 2 x 1 cos 2 x and w sin 4 x 1 2 cos 2 x cos 4 x which are collinear since ad bc if n 3 v 0 1 2 cos 2 x and w 0 1 2 cos 2 x 2 cos 4 x which are collinear since ad bc or equivalently since the three points lie on the vertical line x 0 if n greater than 3 we can use the general case qed figure 21 a and 21 b this means that if a code of a rhombus tower contains the integer 2 n other than at the start or at the end then any adjacent integer must be either 2 n 2 2 n or 2 n 2 in other words it can change by no more than 2 if at all we will also say that other than at the end or the start 2 n forces the next or preceding code number in a rhombus tower to differ by no more than two cor 2 it follows that the right corridor as it passes from the first level to the second level is of the form 21313131212131 or in code by 6 4 which means that the first level ends 2131313121 6 2 in code and hence by antisymmetry the first level starts exactly 131212121 or 2 6 in code proof since by cor 1 it is of the form 131313121213 and can t be of the form 2 k 4 for k 4 by rhombus rule a qed rhombus rule b the subcodes a 2 n 2 n 2 2 k 1 2 n with n 1 k 0 where 2 n is not the first or the last code number never appears in the code sequence of any rhombus pool shot and b 2 n 2 n 2 2 k 1 2 n with n 2 k 0 never appears in the code sequence of any rhombus pool shot note for part b there need not be any other code numbers 17 proof a the black blue vector between the two starred points is parallel to the blue black vector between the double starred points since the integers between them excluding the first and including the last are

shot where 2 n is not the first code number similarily for 2 n 4 2 n 2 2 k 2 n where n 1 k 0 where 2 n is not the last code number proof note this is true for k 0 by rhombus rule a so we can assume that k 0 now the black blue vector between the two starred points below is parallel to the blue black vector between the double starred points since the 18 integers between them excluding the first

impossible by cor 2 as it must at least be of the form 6 4 now observe that a 2 cannot be the last code number since the first 4 corresponds to the two special blue points and a blue line which would mean that this 2 would also correspond to a blue point since the color of the lines alternate which contradicts the definition of a corridor that the last c point is black on the other hand if 2 is not the last code number then 6 42 k 2 is impossible by the second part of rhombus rule c using n 1 qed corridor lemma 2 the right corridor as it passes from the first level to the second level can t be of the form 6 42 k 1 2 with k 0 where 2 is not the last code number proof consider the two special blue c points cm cm 1 the first two points starred below and the c points cm 4 k 2 and cm 4 k 3 the vector v from the blue point cm to the black point cm 4 k 2 is exactly equal and hence parallel to the vector w from the blue point cm 1 to the blue point cm 4 k 3 since both equal sin 2 x 2 k 1 2 k 1 cos 2 x and hence by the non corridor test 1 there is no corridor 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 k 1 lines 2 black 0 blue qed cor 5 it follows that the right corridor as it passes from the first level to the second level ends at 6 4 2 or continues on in the form 6 4 4 19 proof if it doesn t end at 6 4 2 and continues on then since the second level must end in a 2 the only choices are 6 4 2 which is impossible by corridor lemma 2 since 2 is not the last code number or 6 4 6 which is impossible by rhombus rule b or 6 4 4 which must be the case qed rhombus rule d the following subcodes never appear

2 k 2 note 1 the first two cases are 6 42 k 6 forces 6 42 k 6 82 k 2 n 2 case 6 42 k 6 82 k 1 10 forces 6 42 k 6 82 k 1 10 12 2 k 2 n 3 case note 2 by the note to rhombus rule f if this subcode doesn t keep continuing to the right for at least 2 k 1 spots then it would have to end in 4 n 4 4 n 2 or 4 n but since n 2 none of these values is 2 hence as the right corridor must end in the code 2 this subcode must keep continuing to the right for at least 2 k 1 spots and rhombus rule f applies corridor lemma 3 the right corridor as it passes from the first level to the second level can t be of the form 6 42 k 6 with k 0 proof since then by the above results starting with n 2 the code sequence 6 42 k 6 keeps growing arbitrarily large and hence never ends in 2 which is impossible more specifically if k 2 then 6 42 k 6 forces 6 42 k 6 82 k 2 using iii with n 2 which forces 6 42 k 6 82 k 1 using i with n 2 which forces 6 42 k 6 82 k 1 10 using ii with n 2 which forces 6 42 k 6 82 k 1 10 122 k 2 using iii with n 3 and the code numbers keep growing as we keep using i ii and iii if k 1 we cannot use rhombus rule f and instead use mid corridor growth rule a and b and rhombus rule b as follows starting with 6 42 6 this 27 forces 6 42 6 8 since 4 6 4 by b and 6 42 62 by a with k 1 are impossible which forces 6 42 6 8 10 since 6 8 6 by b and 6 42 6 82 by b with k 1 are impossible which forces 6 42 6 8 10 12 since 8 10 8 by b and 6 42 6 8 102 by a with k 1 are impossible and the code numbers keep growing as we keep using a b and rhombus rule b note k 0 is impossible as the code sequence must be of the form 6 4 by cor 2 qed corridor lemma 4 the right corridor as it passes from the first to the second level is exactly of the form 6 42 k 1 2 for k 0 which can also be written in the form 6 42 s 2 4 2 starting with s 1 proof we have showed that the code sequence of the right corridor as it passes from the first to the second level 1 is of the form 6 4 by cor 2 2 is not of the form 6 42 k 1 2 with k 0 by corridor lemma 2 where 2 is not the last code number 3 is not of the form 6 42 k 2 or 6 42 k 2 with k 0 by cor 4 4 is not of the form 6 42 k 6 with with k 0 by corridor lemma 3 5 is not of the form 6 42 k 1 6 with k 0 by cor 3 6 is not of the form 6 42 k 1 6 or 6 42 k 6 with k 0 since it must end in the code 2 by corridor lemma 1 since there is only one remaining choice this means that it must be exactly of the form 6 42 k 1 2 where 2 is the last code number qed note this means the second level is exactly described by the code 2 42 k 2 for some k 0 11 the classification theorem we are now in a position to classify all corridor towers the classification theorem the only corridor rhombus towers are of the code sequence form 2 jn 4 2 for n 1 where j 6 82 k 2 6 42 k 2 with k 1 2 6 82 k 2 6 42 k 2 6 82 k 2 6 42 k 2 6 82 k 2 6 42 k 2 4 2 or an extended version of the above with code sequence form 2 ks jn 4 2 where k jn 4 ln 4 where l 22 42 k 2 for s 0 note it follows that the first level is exactly of the form 2 jn 1 6 82 k 2 6 2 or in the extended version of the form 2 ks jn 1 6 82 k 2 6 2 while the second level is exactly of the form 2 42 k 2 2 28 to prove this we need to develop many more rules in the meantime it is easy to prove the following fact the ratio of the width of second corridor to that of the first corridor is n 1 to 1 or equivalently the ratio of the width of the left corridor to the right corridor is n to 1 proof given the corridor rhombus tower 2 jn 4 2 in standard position the coordinates of c 1 are 0 1 of the special point cm are u v where u n 1 sin 2 x nsin 4 x and v n 4 k 2 2 k 3 n 6 k 3 2 k 3 cos 2 x n 2 k 1 cos 4 x and of cn are e f where e nsin 2 x nsin 4 x and f n 4 k 2 2 n 6 k 3 2 cos 2 x n 2 k 1 cos 4 x this means that the slope of the boundary line from c 1 to cn is given by m b a where a nsin 2 x nsin 4 x and b n 4 k 2 1 n 6 k 3 2 cos 2 x n 2 k 1 cos 4 x now if d is the intersection of this boundary line with the line through cm 1 and cm then the coordinates of d are u 1 mu but then the distance from cm to d is v 1 mu 1 n and the result follows 0 2 0 2 4 2 0 2 4 2 0 2 2 k 2 times 4 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 k 2 times n times 2 0 2 qed figure 26 consequence 1 it follows that any poolshot leaving the base ab within and parallel to the right corridor of the form 2 jn 4 2 can be considered to enter and re enter the left corridor n times before returning to the right corridor and becoming periodic after 32 nk 16 n 8 reflections if we then straighten out this poolshot and form the corresponding rhombus tower not corridor tower it will be described by the code sequence 2 jn 4 2 2 42 k 2 2 n 2 jn 4 22 42 k 2 n 2 2 jn 4 ln 2 observe that the first and last 2 are separated by an odd number of code numbers which means that the corresponding side sequence is of the form 1312 2131 in other words the first and last reflections are in side ac figure 27 consequence 2 it further follows that we can extend the corridor rhombus 29 tower backwards to add in multiples of this periodic path to create longer cor ridor rhombus towers these will have the form 2 jn 4 ln 2 extended to 2 jn 4 ln 2 extended to 2 jn 4 ln 2 extended to 2 jn 4 2 which is the same as 2 jn 4 ln 4 jn 4 ln 4 jn 4 ln 4 jn 4 2 because of the preceding observation these are just longer versions of 2 jn 4 2 with code sequences 2 ks jn 4 2 where k jn 4 ln 4 and l 22 42 k 2 and with the same ratio n to 1 of the two corridors we will call these the periodic corridor extensions of 2 jn 4 2 figure 28 12 two subcodes

upwards observe that a corridor in backwards standard position will have all b points and black c points on the left side and all a points and blue c points on the right side of the corridor and will still lean to the right further for a corridor in backwards standard position the integers in the blue lines now decrease while the integers in the black lines now increase so in the array below the

position ends in 2 42 k 1 jn 4 2 with j 6 82 k 2 6 42 k 2 and for k 1 n 1 then since its boundary lines are locked in and since the top portion of the tower contains a copy of the corridor rhombus

conclusion with s 2 k 1 4 65 4 impossible rhombus rule b n 2 66 4 2 potential corridor tower of form 2 66 4 2 and so forth conclusion it follows that the only potential corridor rhombus towers are of the form 2 jn 4 2 where j 6 82 k 2 6 42 k 2 for k 1 n 1 or one of its periodic corridor extensions 19 existance it is enough to show that corridor rhombus towers with code sequence 2 jn 4 2 exist since if they do then so too do their periodic corridor extensions theorem rhombus towers of the code sequence form 2 jn 4 2 where j 6 82 k 2 6 42 k 2 and n 1 k 1 satisfy all three corridor conditions for all x such that 0 x for some sufficently small and hence are corridor rhombus towers for those x s proof we will assume the rhombus tower is in standard position and that the first reflection is in side ac condition 1 is satisfied by starting the first reflection of the rhombus tower in side a 0 c 1 and since the given code sequence has an odd number of code numbers in it the last reflection must also be in side ancn noting that if a code sequence of a rhombus tower has an odd number of even code numbers in it then the first and last reflection are in the same side condition 2 is satisfied since the first level has an even length symmetric code sequence 2 6 82 k 2 6 42 k 2 jn 2 6 82 k 2 6 2 and the second level also 80 has an even length symmetric code sequence 2 42 k 2 2 noting that if a code sequence of a rhombus tower has an even number of even code numbers in it and its first reflection is in side ac then its last reflection is in side bc and vice versa further if the number of blue points in a rhombus tower equals the number of black points then the first and last appearance of side ab are parallel this is always the case if its code sequence is symmetric and of even length it remains to show that condition 3 is satisfied now if k 1 consider the vertical array corresponding to 2 jn 4 2 below in standard position and observe that all the 2 n 1 single starred points are collinear black c points 0 2 0 2 4 2 0 2 4 2 0 2 2 k 2 times 4 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 k 2 times n times 2 0 2 this is easily seen by observing that if k 1 then v a b sin 4 x 2 k 1 4 k 2 cos 2 x 2 k 1 cos 4 x is a vector between the first pair and as well as between every succesive odd numbered pair of starred points and w c d sin 2 x 2 k 1 2 k 1 cos 2 x is a vector between the second pair and as well as between every succesive even numbered pair of starred points and since ad bc all these starred points are all collinear black c points on a line l this line l has positive slope 2 k 1 4 k 2 cos 2 x 2 k 1 cos 4 x sin 4 x since 0 8 x 180 and this is the same as n 4 k 2 n 6 k 3 cos 2 x n 2 k 1 cos 4 x nsin 2 x nsin 4 x which is the slope between the first and last starred points if k 1 n 1 then if v a b sin 4 x 1 2 cos 2 x cos 4 x is a vector between the first pair of starred points and w c d sin 2 x 1 cos 2 x is a vector between the second pair of starred points then observe that all other vectors between successive starred points alternate between v and w now since ad bc all these starred points are all collinear black c points on a line l with positive slope since 0 6 x 180 0 2 0 2 4 2 0 n times 2 0 81 2 now further observe if k 1 1 that the y coordinates of all c points strictly increase as we move down and from left to right along the vertical array as long as 8 x 180 since the y coordinate of the first c point is 1 and this increases by either 1 cos 2 x or cos 4 x as we go to the next successive c point if k 1 then the y coordinates of successive black c points increase since this increases by either 1 cos 2 x or 1 2 cos 2 x cos 4 x 4 cos 2 xcos 2 x as long as 6 x 180 2 that the x coordinate of the 2 i 1 st starred point is isin 2 x isin 4 x for i 0 and that the x coordinate of the 2 i 2 th starred point is isin 2 x i 1 sin 4 x for i 0 3 that the x coordinate of every black c point between the 2 i 1 st and the 2 i 2 th starred points is either i 1 sin 2 x i 1 sin 4 x or isin 2 x i 1 sin 4 x not including the 2 i 1 st starred point 4 that the x coordinate of every black c point between the 2 i 2 th and the 2 i 3 th starred points is i 1 sin 2 x i 1 sin 4 x not including the 2 i 2 th starred point 5 the slope of line l is strictly less than the slope of the right boundary line c 1 cn of the first corridor which is given by n 4 k 2 1 n 6 k 3 2 cos 2 x n 2 k 1 cos 4 x nsin 2 x nsin 4 x for 8 x 180 since this inequality is equivalent to sin 2 x sin 4 x sin 6 x 0 if k 1 then the same result holds as long as sin 2 x sin 4 x 0 which is the case since we must have 6 x 180 if k 1 it follows from this that the slope from c 1 to any other black c point different from cn is slope of l and hence strictly less than the slope of c 1 cn which means that their are no black c points in the strict interior of the two corridors if 8 x 180 if k 1 then since the only black c points not on line l corresponding to the code number 2 located between 4 and 0 have the same x coordinate as that of the adjacent 0 and since points 1 and 5 still hold with 6 x 180 we get the same result interestingly if k 1 and we consider all the 2 n starred blue c points below they are also collinear on a line l which has exactly the same positive slope as the line l above with the last starred point being the special blue point cm further this line l also goes through cn the last black c point figure 30 0 82 2 0 2 4 2 0 2 4 2 0 2 2 k 2 times 4 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 k 2 times n times 2 0 2 if k 1 we get the same result using the 2 n 1 starred blue c points below 0 2 0 2 4 2 0 n times 2 0 2 figure 31 now by antisymmetry of the first level the line between any blue point cm i 1 with m 1 i 1 and the blue point cm is parallel to the line through the first black point c 1 and the black point ci and hence has slope that of the line l this means there can be no blue c points in the interior of the first level of the right corridor finally all blue points ci with i m have the same x coordinate as cm and hence none of these blue points can lie in the interior of the second corridor thus the interiors of the corridors are free of c points for x 22 5 if k 1 and for x 30 if k 1 now since the coordinates of the a b and c points in the tower are continuous functions of x if we let x 0 the a b and c points will converge to the base triangle abc this means that for sufficiently small x the a and b points will also lie outside the two corridors noting that the limit of the slope of c 1 cn is infinity as x 0 hence condition 3 is satisfied for sufficiently small x qed figure 32 we give some more precise bounds on below 83 20 existance bounds by studying the behavior of the a and b points we can find bounds for we will assume the corridor rhombus towers are in standard position and introduce a second coordinate system with the first b point being the origin and the distance between successive b points being one unit the x axis is the line through ab with the positive y axis pointing upwards we will call this the b coordinate system observe that the two coordinate systems have a different unit but the slope of any fixed line remains the same in both systems conversion between the two systems if a point has coordinates u v in the b system then it has coordinates 1 2 cotx 2 ucosx 1 2 2 vcosx in the original coordinate system proof referencing fig 33 the origin of the b system has coordinates 1 2 cotx 1 2 in the original system and since the distance between successive b points in the original system is cscxcos 90 2 x 2 cosx this represents the unit in the b system it follows that u v in the b system converts to 1 2 cotx 2 ucosx 1 2 2 vcosx in the original coordinate system qed figure 33 algorithm three given a corridor rhombus tower in standard position we can calculate the coordinates of the b points in the b coordinate system as follows 1 introduce the corresponding vertical array startng with the black line 0 note the only integers in the array will then be of the type 2 0 2 or 4 2 ignore all blue lines to get the black vertical array 3 there is a one to one correspondence between the black c points and the b points in the tower omitting the first b point b 0 note because of this correspondence we can think of each integer in the black vertical array as representing its corresponding b point a the first b point b 0 has coordinates 0 0 b for each integer of the following type add the following to the previous b coordinates 0 add sinx cosx 2 add sinx cosx 4 add sin 3 x cos 3 x 2 add sin 3 x cos 3 x figure 34 example given the tower 2 62 4 2 step 1 the corresponding vertical array 0 2 0 2 84 4 2 0 2 0 2 step 2 ignore the blue lines to form the black vertical array 0 4 2 0 2 step 3 the successive coordinates of the b points in the b coordinate system after b 0 0 0 are then 0 sinx cosx 4 sinx sin 3 x cosx cos 3 x 2 sin 3 x 2 cosx cos 3 x 0 sinx sin 3 x 3 cosx cos 3 x 2 sin 3 x 4 cosx cos 3 x fact given the tower 2 jn 4 2 where j 6 82 k 2 6 42 k 2 and n 2 k 2 and its black vertical array below the starred b points are collinear on a line l 1 proof the starred points are collinear since the

increases by either cosx or cos 3 x as we move from one b point to the next successive b point since 0 8 x 180 this means that successive b points are higher up 2 that the x coordinate of the b point corresponding to the i 1 st appearance of 2 is sinx isin 3 x for i 0 3 that the slope of l 1 in the b coordinate system is 4 k 2 cosx 2 k 1 cos 3 x sin 3 x which is positive since 0 x 22 5 4 that the x coordinates of the b points corresponding to the integers between the i 1 st for i 0 appearance of 2 and the i 2 th appearance of 2 not including the i 1 st appearance of 2 are of the form sinx i 1 sin 3 x i 1 sin 3 x i 2 sin 3 x or sinx i 2 sin 3 x note that sinx i 1 sin 3 x is the smallest number in this list since 0 x 22 5 it further follows since successive y coordinates are increasing that this particular set of b points must lie to the right of the line l 1 5 that the x coordinates of the b points corresponding to the integers before the first appearance of 2 are of the form sinx sinx sin 3 x sin 3 x or 0 note that sinx which corresponds to the first 2 is the smallest number in this list it also follows that this particular set of b points must lie to the right of the line l 1 6 that the x coordinates of the b points corresponding to the integers strictly after the last appearance of 2 are of the form sinx nsin 3 x or nsin 3 x note that sinx nsin 3 x corresponds to the second last integer 0 and that nsin 3 x corresponds to the last integer 2 and that the slopes of the lines between the b point corrsponding to the last starred integer and the b point corresponding a to the last integer 2 is 2 k 1 cosx cos 3 x sinx sin 3 x b to the second last integer 0 is 2 kcosx cos 3 x sin 3 x note that these slopes are the slope of l 1 since k 2 and 0 x 22 5 it then follows that this particular set of b points must lie to the right of the line l 1 finally note that the slope from a is less than the slope from b since that is equivalent to k 1 sin 2 x 0 86 conclusion 1 all the b points lie on the line l 1 or lie to the right of the line l 1 figure 35 conclusion 2 the slope of l 1 is less than the slope m b a of the boundary line of the right corridor where a nsin 2 x nsin 4 x and b 4 k 2 n 1 6 k 3 n 2 cos 2 x 2 k 1 ncos 4 x proof since b 4 k 2 n 6 k 3 ncos 2 x 2 k 1 ncos 4 x for 0 x 22 5 it is enough to show that slope of l 1 4 k 2 n 6 k 3 ncos 2 x 2 k 1 ncos 4 x nsin 2 x nsin 4 x which is equivalent to 2 cosx cos 3 x sin 3 x 2 3 cos 2 x cos 4 x sin 2 x sin 4 x which is true since both sides equal cotx qed conclusion 3 the only b point that can lie on right boundary line of the right corridor is the b point corresponding to the first starred code number 2 with coordinates sinx 2 k 1 cosx 2 k 2 cos 3 x in the b system special k 1 case given the corridor rhombus tower 2 62 n 4 2 in standard position where n 1 k 1 the starred b points are collinear on a line l 1 proof in the b coordinate system using the black vertical array below the starred b points are collinear on a line l 1 since the vector between successive 0 s is v a b where a sin 3 x and b 2 cosx cos 3 x and the vector between the last two starred points is w c d where c sinx and d cosx and ad bc note the slope of l 1 is cotx which is positive for 0 x 30 0 4 2 0 4 2 0 n times 2 qed figure 36 further observe 1 that the y coordinates of the b points increase by either cos x or cos 3 x as we move from one b point to the next successive b point keep in mind that since 0 6 x 180 successive b points are higher up 2 that the x coordinate of the b point corresponding to the ith appearance of 0 is sinx i 1 sin 3 x for i 1 3 that the x coordinates of the b points corresonding to the code numbers be tween the ith appearance of 0 and the i 1 th appearance of 0 not including the ith appearance of 0 are successively 4 sinx isin 3 x 2 isin 3 x 87 0 sinx isin 3 x 4 the last b point bn is on l 1 and the first b point b 0 is to the right of l 1 it follows that all b points are on the line l 1 or lie to the right of the line l 1 since 0 x 30 5 that the slope of l 1 is less than the slope m b a of the boundary line of the right corridor where a nsin 2 x nsin 4 x and b 2 n 1 3 n 2 cos 2 x ncos 4 x since acosx bsinx is equivalent to 0 sin 3 x which is the case this means that the only b point that can lie on the right boundary line of the right corridor is the b point corresponding to the first 0 and with coor dinates sinx cosx special n 1 k 2 case given the corridor rhombus tower 2 j 4 2 in standard position where j 6 82 k 2 6 42 k 2 and where k 2 the starred b points are collinear on a vertical line l 1 proof in the b coordinate system using the black vertical array below the starred points all have the same x coordinate namely sinx 0 4 2 0 2 4 2 0 2 k 1 times 4 2 0 2 0 2 0 k 1 times 2 qed observe that in the b coordinate system 1 that the y coordinates of the b points increase by either cos x or cos 3 x as we move from one b point to the next successive b point keep in mind that since 0 8 x 180 successive b points are higher up 2 the x coordinates of all b points except for b 0 which is 0 are sinx sinx sin 3 x or sin 3 x 3 the slope of c 1 cn is 4 k 1 6 k 1 cos 2 x 2 k 1 cos 4 x sin 2 x sin 4 x which is positive for all x 22 5 4 the x coordinate of the last b point bn is sin 3 x and it follows that all b points with the same x coordinate lie beneath it on a vertical line this means that the only b point on this vertical line that could possibly lie on the right boundary line of the right corridor is bn but this can t happen since cn 3 cnbn 90 x c 1 cnbn 90 3 x cn 1 cnbn where 0 x 22 5 figure 37 88 5 the x coordinate of the second last b point bn 1 is sinx sin 3 x and it follows that all b points with the same x coordinate lie beneath it on a vertical line this means that the only b point on this vertical line that could possibly lie on the right boundary line of the right corridor is bn 1 but this can t happen since cn 3 cnbn 1 90 3 x c 1 cnbn 1 90 x cn 1 cnbn 1 where 0 x 22 5 this means that the only b point that can lie on the right boundary line of the right corridor is the b point with x coordinate sinx and which has the highest y coordinate namely 2 k 1 cosx 2 k 2 cos 3 x corresponding to the last 2 conclusion in all cases the only b point that can lie on the right boundary line of the right corridor of the corridor rhombus tower 2 jn 4 2 where j 6 82 k 2 6 42 k 2 andn 1 k 1 is the b point with b coordinates sinx 2 k 1 cosx 2 k 2 cos 3 x which corresponds to the coordinates cotx 2 sin 2 x 4 k 1 2 4 k 3 cos 2 x 2 k 2 cos 4 x in the original coordinate system note that this key b point is in the first level fact the key b point lies on the right boundary line of the right corridor of 2 jn 4 2 where j 6 82 k 2 6 42 k 2 and n 1 k 1 if kn 1 cosx 3 k 1 n 1 cos 3 x 4 k 2 n 1 cos 5 x 3 k 2 ncos 7 x k 1 ncos 9 x 0 proof the only b point that can lie on the right boundary line of the right corridor would occur when the slope m of c 1 cn equals the slope m 1 from c 1 to the b point cotx 2 sin 2 x 4 k 1 2 4 k 3 cos 2 x 2 k 2 cos 4 x nowm 1 equals 4 k 3 2 4 k 3 cos 2 x 2 k 2 cos 4 x cotx 2 sin 2 x 4 k 3 8 k 6 cos 2 x 4 k 4 cos 4 x cotx 2 sin 2 x sinx 4 k 3 8 k 6 cos 2 x 4 k 4 cos 4 x cos 3 x using cosx 2 sinxsin 2 x cos 3 x setting this equal to the slope m n 4 k 2 1 n 6 k 3 2 cos 2 x n 2 k 1 cos 4 x nsin 2 x nsin 4 x cross multiplying simplifying and using the identities sinx sin 2 x sin 4 x cosx cos 5 x 2 and 2 cosnxcosmx cos n m x cos n m x we get the desired condition qed note that if kn 1 cosx 3 k 1 n 1 cos 3 x 4 k 2 n 1 cos 5 x 3 k 2 ncos 7 x k 1 ncos 9 x 0 then the key b point lies to the left of the right boundary line and the corridor rhombus tower would not exist for those x s important comment 1 we don t have to worry about the a points since by antisymmetry an a point below the second level will lie on the left boundary line of the right corridor exactly when the antisymmetric b point lies on the right boundary line of the right corridor similarly an a point above the second level will lie on the left boundary line of the upper corridor exactly when the antisymmetric b point lies on the right boundary line of the upper corridor which as it turns out can never happen in a corridor rhombus tower because of the above conclusion figure 38 89 it is worth noting that in a corridor rhombus tower since a 0 b 0 is parallel to ambm which is parallel to anbn and since successive b points from which it follows that successive a points have increasing y coordinates that any b point in the first level that lies on c 1 cn must do so in the first level similarly for second level b points important comment 2 given the corridor rhombus tower 2 jn 4 2 with n 1 k 1 then if 1 k 1 the corridor tower only exists for those x s in the interval 0 30 for which gn x n 1 cosx 2 n 1 cos 3 x 2 n 1 cos 5 x ncos 7 x 0 2 k 1 the corridor tower only exists for those x s in the interval 0 22 5 for which fk n x kn 1 cosx 3 k 1 n 1 cos 3 x 4 k 2 n 1 cos 5 x 3 k 2 ncos 7 x k 1 ncos 9 x 0 consequences 1 observe that g n x n 1 sinx 6 n 3 sin 3 x 7 n sin 5 x sin 7 x 3 n 5 sin 5 x 0 on 0 30 since sinx sin 3 x sin 5 x and sin 5 x sin 7 x 2 sin 6 xcosx are all positive on 0 30 it follows that gn x is strictly decreasing on 0 30 and since gn 0 6 n 3 and gn 30 3 n gn x has an unique root on 0 30 given by arctan 6 n 1 2 8 n 2 4 n 1 2 n 3 since gn 22 5 cos 22 5 0 this unique root occurs in 22 5 30 conclusion 1 this means that the corridor rhombus tower 2 62 n 4 2 forn 1 exists if and only if 0 x arctan 6 n 1 2 8 n 2 4 n 1 2 n 3 2 as a special case if k 1 n 1 the corridor rhombus tower 2 62 4 2 exists for 2 cosx 3 cos 3 x 3 cos 5 x cos 7 x 0 and x in 0 30 which only holds for 0 x arctan 2 13 7 or approximately 0 x 24 6768 3 as a further special case if k 1 n 2 the corridor rhombus tower 2 64 4 2 exists for 3 cosx 5 cos 3 x 5 cos 5 x 2 cos 7 x 0 and x in 0 30 which only holds for 0 x arctan 13 2 41 or approximately 0 x 23 7578 now f n 6 n 1 2 8 n 2 4 n 1 2 n 3 is strictly decreasing on 2 since its derivative f n 0 is equivalent to 0 2 n 3 2 which holds on 2 this means the unique root of gn x on 0 30 decreases as n increases on 2 conclusion 2 further since limn arctan 6 n 1 2 8 n 2 4 n 1 2 n 3 arctan 3 8 which equals 22 5 the corridor rhombus tower 2 62 n 4 2 with n 1 exists for all 0 x 22 5 at least 4 for n 1 and k 2 fk n x has an unique root in 18 22 5 proof consider the derivative f k n x kn 1 sinx 3 3 k 1 n 1 sin 3 x 5 4 k 2 n 1 sin 5 x 7 3 k 2 nsin 7 x 9 k 1 nsin 9 x which 90 we can write in the form f k n x kn 1 sinx 3 3 k 1 n 1 sin 3 x 5 4 k 2 n 1 sin 5 x 9 k 1 n sin 7 x sin 9 x 12 nk 5 n sin 7 x by rearranging its terms now observe that since sinx sin 3 x sin 5 x sin 7 x and sin 7 x sin 9 x 2 sin 8 xcosx are all positive on 0 22 5 f k n x is negative on 0 22 5 which means that fk n x is strictly decreasing on 0 22 5 further since fk n 18 n 1 cos 18 n 1 cos 54 0 and fk n 22 5 3 n 1 k 1 cos 22 5 n 1 k cos 67 5 0 for k 2 fk n x has an unique root in 0 22 5 which occurs in 18 22 5 qed conclusion 3 from the proof since fk n x is strictly decreasing on 0 22 5 and has a root in 18 22 5 the corridor rhombus tower 2 jn 4 2 with n 1 k 2 exists for all 0 x 18 at least 5 fk 1 n x fk n x on 18 22 5 for n 1 and k 2 proof note that fk 1 n x fk n x ncosx 3 ncos 3 x 4 ncos 5 x 3 ncos 7 x ncos 9 x and hence f k 1 n x f k n x nsinx 9 nsin 3 x 20 nsin 5 x 21 nsin 7 x 9 nsin 9 x nsinx 9 nsin 3 x 20 nsin 5 x 9 n sin 7 x sin 9 x 12 nsin 7 x this derivative is 0 for all x in 0 22 5 since sinx sin 3 x sin 5 x sin 7 x and sin 7 x sin 9 x 2 sin 8 xcosx are all 0 on 0 22 5 this means that fk 1 n x fk n x is strictly decreasing on 0 22 5 and since fk 1 n 18 fk n 18 0 and fk 1 n 22 5 fk n 22 5 ncos 67 5 3 ncos 22 5 0 it follows that fk 1 n x fk n x on 18 22 5 qed 6 it follows that the unique root of fk 1 n x is strictly less than the unique root of fk n x in 0 22 5 for n 1 and k 2 and they both occur in 18 22 5 7 for fixed n 1 the limk unique root of fk n x is 18 10 in radians proof we can assume that k 6 we first write fk n x in the form kn n cosx cos 9 x 3 k 2 n cos 3 x cos 7 x 4 k 2 n 1 cos 5 x n 1 cosx n 1 cos 3 x and observe that cosx cos 9 x 2 cos 5 xcos 4 x cos 3 x cos 7 x 2 cos 5 xcos 2 x and cos 5 x are all 0 on 18 22 5 it follows that fk n x gk n x on 18 22 5 where gk n x 2 kncos 5 x 4 n since n 1 cosx n 1 cos 3 x 4 n and 4 k 2 n 1 2 kn now gk n 18 4 n 0 gk n 22 5 2 kncos 112 5 4 n 0 since k 6 and g k n x 10 knsin 5 x 0 on 18 22 5 this means that 18 the unique root of fk n x the unique root of gk n x on 18 22 5 but gk n x 0 when x 2 arccos 2 k this means that the limk unique root of fk n x is 10 qed also note that fk n 1 x fk n x kcosx 3 k 1 cos 3 x 4 k 2 cos 5 x 3 k 2 cos 7 x k 1 cos 9 x now if fk n 0 where is in 18 22 5 then fk n 1 kcos 3 k 1 cos 3 4 k 2 cos 5 3 k 2 cos 7 k 1 cos 9 but fk n kn 1 cos 3 k 1 n 1 cos 3 4 k 2 n 1 cos 5 3 k 2 ncos 7 91 k 1 ncos 9 n kcos 3 k 1 cos 3 4 k 2 cos 5 3 k 2 cos 7 k 1 cos 9 cos cos 3 cos 5 nfk n 1 cos cos 3 cos 5 0 and since cos 3 x cos 5 x 2 cos 4 xcosx 0 on 18 22 5 it follows that fk n 1 cos cos 3 cos 5 n 0 8 noting that fk n 1 18 n 2 cos 18 n 2 cos 54 0 this means that the unique root of fk n 1 x is strictly less than the unique root of fk n x on 0 22 5 for n 1 and k 2 and they both occur in 18 22 5 caution it is not true that limn unique root of fk n x on 18 22 5 is 18 for example if k 2 f 2 n 19 is approximately 3751 n 1 4029 0 whereas as previously noted f 2 n 22 5 0 which means the unique root of f 2 n x 0 occurs in 19 22 5 for all n acknowledgements thanks to arno berger from the university of alberta for listening to my thoughts and boyan marinov and david szepesvari from the
