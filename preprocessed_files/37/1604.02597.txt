sub family of generalized chacon s map 3 is in troduced a skew product related to the structure of the generalized del junco rudolph s map is introduced a relative prime relation hk 1 1 mod q is verified based on the proposition of it erations of this skew product we say a measure preserving transformation t is totally rank one if t n n n is rank one in this paper we show that of every generalized del junco rudolph s map is totally rank one since boltzmann introduced the term of ergodic in his work on statistical mechanics the ergodic the ory has been studied and developed actively regarding modelized physical systems with dynamic nature from ergodicity mixing properties isomorphism of systems to simplicity and many other properties we seriously desire concrete examples to better understand and study these properties with related clas sifications the cutting and stacking method provides effective measure theoretical approximations of transformations and at the same time it provides a fruitful generating machine for typical examples and counter examples corresponding to symbolic shifting maps extending from the original construction by r v chacon 2 a a prikhod ko and v v ryzhikov construction 7 in 9 further described how to construct a transformation on 0 1 using the cutting and stacking method this kind of constructional approach may help us understand not only the symbolic representing of a dynamic system but also its powers g r goodson 5 studied the condition for an ergodic automorphism t to be conjugate to its composition square t 2 what s more del junco 7 showed that the property of being conjugate to its square is a non generic property of automorphisms thus therefore it is not trivial at all to study the powers of ergodic automorphisms we say a finite measure preserving system x t is rank one if a series of rokhlin tower with base subset f approximates any partition p of x rank one system can be defined in multiple literatures 3 rank one implies simple spectrum 1 4 rigidity implies singular spectrum 4 the cutting and stacking structure also gives us a way to study a rank one system by the symbolic methods 2 6 etc all these make it interesting to learn whether a transformation is rank one veech 10 showed that measure theoretically almost all interval exchange transformations are rank one a famous rank one transformation the chacon s map coded as bk 1 bkbk 1 bk and its extension are also studied in this chapter we will study the family of generalized del junco rudolph s maps and extend the rank one property of this family of maps 6 to their powers of natural numbers we admit the notion of totally rank one for this property definition 3 1 and make the main conclusion as theorem 3 3 1 schlumberger westerngeco geosolution

recursion is given we extend this map notated by del junco rudolph s map here to a family of symbolic maps generalized del junco rudolph s maps it is a sub family of the family of generalized chacon s map 3 we will describe the construction and some observations of the generalized del junco rudolph s maps in this section the recursion formula determines the language of the system thus also the phase space of the sys tem which is a subset of z product space of the set of alphabet 0 1 that is b 0 0 b 1 b 0 a 1 b 0 b a 1 a b 1 b 2 bk 1 bk a bk 1 b 0 b a bk let x 0 1 z be defined by x x x 1 x 0 x 1 xk for any m z l n xmxm 1 xm l 1 is a consecutive sequence of some bk k n let t be the left shifting transformation on x so t is a two sided shift map definition 1 1 if a sequence a appears consecutively in some bk we say a is a valid sequence or a word in x language of length l next some combinatorical fact about t will be shown some further concerns will be discussed in chapter 4 for the special purpose the following facts are easily seen or computed some of them have been pointed out in del junco rudolpf 1 lemma 1 2 let t be the symbolic transformation defined above i e the generalized del junco rudolph map we have the follow propositions 1 hk 1 b k 1 hk 1 and b k k 1 2 hk b k k 1 2 1 2 except for the two given copies of bn there is no other consecutive sequence of letters which is identically bn 3 suppose x m 2 hkm bk 1 bk then x m 1 m hk bk x m 3 hk m 2 hk 1 for any k 1 proof iii since bk 1 bk is in some bj j k both the left and the right word to bk 1 bk of length hk are bk topologically we have the following conclusion lemma 1 3 the system x t is minimal proof this is true based on the coding construction of the system measure theoretically a t invariant measure of x may be determined by the measure of each cylinder which is the asymptotic density of the cylinder name in the language of the symbolic structure del junco rudolpfh s approximation would be introduced for this purpose which asures the coincidence of the measure defined and the asymptotic density by the the uniform ergodic theorem remark we say a is a cylinder set with name l at position j if a x xj xj l 1 2 let dk a be the density in b z k bkbk of the occurrences of a word a 0 al 1 then for k large enough dk 1 dk 2 l hk 1 1 1 this inequality is true because the only difference is taking place at the higher spacer the spacer between two bk definition 1 4 let sk x x hk hk bk 1 bk next the measure is introduced based on the notion of dk d lim k dk 1 2 if a is a cylinder set with name we define a d 1 3 and extend this countably additive measure to a shift invariant borel measure on x b t where b is the algebra generated by the set of all the cylinder sets lemma 1 5 is the unique invariant measure of x b t up to a multiple proof each point x x is a generic point of x b t the measure of sk is bounded by proposition 1 6 1 hk 1 sk b hk 1 proof occurrences of sk on the orbit of any x x on the orbit of any x x are separated by at most hk 1 and at least hk 1 1 b remark the above statement is labeled as a proposition since it is crucial for the future evaluation the rigidity of x b t is easily seen by looking at t hk c c for any cylinder c typically just consider b n k t hn bk bk n k the notion of coding distance provides us another way to under stand the rigidity of x b t and to evaluate the approximate speed of the power of t tending to indentity along the sequence hk let n k bnk and set n k t t 1 nhk nhk i 1 d n k code i t 1 4 where d n k code i t n k i t n k i 1 i nhk t 1 i nhk t 1 5 lemma 1 7 lim n n k t t exists 3 proof suppose n 0 thk let t k 1 thk thk i 1 d n k code i t for any n n 0 suppose n tp 0 n 0 n t then n k t t 1 nhk nhk i 1 d n k code i t tp 0 n 1 tp 0 hk p 0 thk i 1 d n k code i t nhk i tp 0 hk 1 d n k code i t thus tp 0 n t k n k t t tp 0 n t k b p 0 hk therefore it is obvious that lim n nk t t tk 1 6 done now let k t t lim n n k t t t k lemma 1 8 k k 1 t t 2 t hk 1 therefore k t t converges define t t lim k k t t this derives the following proposition proposition 1 9 t hk id 1 2 k corollary 1 10 x b t is rigid 2 relative prime relation in this section we set up the number theoretical relation of any positive integer with the height of the k stack hk the result is more general than what is needed in section 3 the sequence of integer hk is also described by induction h 0 1 hk 1 b k 1 hk 1 2 1 where b n b 2 the notation n m n m n is used for the integer k such that k n mod m and 0 k m let zq z qz and z q c qz c q 1 m n is the notation for the largest common di visor of m and n thus zq is a finite commutative ring and z q zq is the multiplicative group of multiply invertible elements of zq 4 given b z q b 2 we define a map from z q zq to itself t z q zq z q zq which is also understood as a skew product of the rotation on z q that is t x y tq b x y bx xy 1 2 2 it is well understood that bx xy 1 z q r lemma 2 1 suppose b q n b q 1 then there exists n n q b n such that t sn id forsomes n proof without loss of generality suppose b z q b 2 since z q zq is a finite set t is just a permutation with finite order lemma 2 2 for any k n we have t k 1 0 bk q hk 1 q b k hk 1 mod q k n 2 3 proof it is easy to see that t 1 0 b q 1 q b q h 0 q t k 1 0 t bk 1 q hk 2 q b k q bk 1 hk 2 1 q bk q hk 1 q therefore the lemma is proved by induction lemma 2 3 suppose b q 1 then hk 0 mod q for infinitely many k n proof by lemma 2 2 t sn 1 0 1 0 therefore we have t sn 1 0 bsn q hsn 1 1 q 1 0 mod q hsn 1 0 q s n n n b q now we can reach the following conclusion based on of lemma 2 3 proposition 2 4 given b n b 2 and the sequence hk defined by 2 1 then for any q n there exist infinitely many k n such that hk 1 1 mod q proof suppose b is divided by q it is done so we only need to investigate the case of 1 d b q q q dq 1 q q b q 1 by lemma 2 3 hk 0 mod q for infinitely many k n on the other hand for k large enough d divides bk 1 thus bk 1 hk 0 mod q hk 1 b k 1 hk 1 1 mod q 5 3 a family of totally rank one maps now we revisit the generalized del junco rudolph s map x b t in this section q is a given integer greater than 1 acting as the power index of the map since the heights of the stack structure satisfies hk 1 b k 1 hk 1 proposition 2 4 shows that for infinitely many n hn 1 mod q for infinitely many n we use the notion nq to denote the set of those integers that is nq k k n hk 1 mod q definition 3 1 totally rank one we say a finite measure preserving system x t is totally rank one if all positive integer powers of t are rank one lemma 3 2 let the sequence hk be defined by 2 1 for any n np and i 6 j 0 i j hn we have qi 6 qj mod hn i 6 j 0 i j hn proof since hn is relatively prime with q now suppose b n to be the base set in the nth stack column then b n is corresponding to the cylinder set cn with name bn the n block in the recursive formula we know that t hn b n b n 1 bn 1 b n 3 1 and hn 1 i 0 t ib n 1 bhn sk 3 2 by proposition 1 6 we have hn 1 i 0 t ib n 1 b 2 hn hn 1 1 1 b n 1 3 3 equation 3 3 shows that the stack of disjoint union of t ib n is almost the whole space except for a part of measure no more than 1 bn 1 equation 3 1 tells us the first return time of b n is hn except for a set of measure no more than 1 bn 1 now suppose n np let a n b n t hn b n t 2 hn b n t q 1 hn b n it is easy to see that a n b n q 1 i 1 b n t ihn b n b n q 1 q 2 2 t hn b n b n by 3 1 we know that a n 1 q 1 q 2 2 1 bn 1 b n 3 4 define the function 1 2 hn by i iq hn since n np hn is relatively prime to q there fore by lemma 3 2 i is a hn permutation it is obvious to see that t qi a n t i b n 0 i hn therefore we have the following 3 claims i t qi a n 0 i hn is a collection of pairwise disjoint sets 6 ii t q hn a n a n 2 a n b n b n t q hn b n q 1 q 2 1 bn 1 b n q bn 1 b n q 2 2 q 2 bn 1 b n 3 5 iii we see that i and ii together with 3 3 imply hn 1 i 0 t q i a n 1 q 1 q 2 2 1 bn 1 hn 1 i 0 t i b n 1 q 1 q 2 2 1 bn 1 hn b n 3 6 we know that cn hn 1 i 0 t i b n is the union of all the levels in the nth stack so x cn is the remainder of the spacer set taken away the set of spacers used in the first n steps during the cutting and stacking process thus x cn sn cn 1 sn 1 2 hn 1 hn 1 i 0 t q i a n 1 q 1 q 2 2 1 bn 1 1 2 hn 1 3 7 remark equation 3 6 shows that the measure of hn 1 i 0 t q i a n the t q stack with base a n is close to the full measure since b n is the base of the n th t stack and hn is the corresponding height now i ii and iii tell us the following theorem 3 3 all the notations as above every generalized del junco ruldoph s map t is totally rank one remark though the rigidity of t q is derived from b it is a simple implication of the fact that all powers of a rigid automorphism on a standard borel space are rigid corollary 3 4 in the weak closure of each general del junco rudolph s map there is a dense g subset of rank one
