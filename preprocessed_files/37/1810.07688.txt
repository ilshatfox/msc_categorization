minimal non invertible maps on the pseudo circle jan p boron ski judy kennedy xiao chuan liu and piotr oprocha abstract in this article we show that r h bing s pseudo circle admits a minimal non invertible map this resolves a conjecture raised by bruin kolyada and snoha in the negative the main tool is a variant of the denjoy rees technique further developed by be guin crovisier le roux combined with detailed study of the structure of the pseudo circle this is the first example of a planar 1 dimensional space that admits both minimal homeo morphisms and minimal noninvertible maps 1 introduction in the late 1960 s j auslander raised a question concerning the existence of min imal noninvertible maps since then examples of such maps have been given but the question as for what spaces such maps exist remains particularly interesting for compact and connected spaces continua in the present paper we are going to give the first example of a 1 dimensional space in the plane that admits both minimal homeomorphisms and minimal noninvertible maps in general for compact spaces the existence of an invertible minimal map is independent of the existence of a non invertible one and there exist spaces that admit both types of maps either one of them or none 23 in 1 auslander and yorke observed that the cantor set admits minimal maps of both kinds in 23 kolyada snoha and trofimchuk showed how to obtain minimal noninvertible maps on the 2 torus from a class of minimal home omorphisms an analogous result was obtained in 33 by sotola and trofimchuk for the klein bottle in 8 clark the first and the last mentioned authors showed the existence of both types of minimal maps for any compact finite dimensional metric space that admits an aperiodic minimal flow the first author showed the exis tence of minimal noninvertible maps for all compact manifolds that admit minimal homeomorphisms in 9 auslander and katznelson showed that the circle admits no minimal noninvertible maps despite supporting minimal homeomorphisms 3 in this context bruin kolyada and snoha asked the following question question 1 10 is the circle the only infinite continuum that admits a minimal homeomorphism but no noninvertible minimal map in the same paper bruin kolyada and snoha conjectured that r h bing s pseu docircle might provide a counterexample see also 32 conjecture 1 10 the pseudo circle is another continuum that admits minimal homeomorphisms but no noninvertible minimal maps quite recently in 14 a construction of a family of continua that admit minimal homeomorphisms but no minimal noninvertible maps was given resolving question 2010 mathematics subject classification 37 b 05 37 b 20 37 b 45 key words and phrases pseudo circle pseudoarc minimal

seems indeed a natural candidate for another counterexample to question 1 as it shares several properties with the circle topologically it is a circle like planar cofrontier whose homeomorphism group contains periodic rotations 19 and it appears in various contexts in dynamical systems handel showed that it appears as both a minimal subset of a volume preserving c smooth planar diffeomorphism 17 and a minimal attractor of a c smooth planar diffeomorphism herman 18 extended handel s construction to show that the pseudo circle can bound an open disk in the complex plane on which a smooth planar diffeomorphism is complex analytic and complex analytically conjugate to an irrational rotation and on the complement of which the diffeomorphism is smoothly conjugate to such a rotation this result was further improved by che ritat who showed that the pseudo circle can appear as the boundary of a siegel disk 11 in 7 the first and last author showed that it also appears as a birkhoff like attractor 7 other related constructions were given by yorke and the second author in 20 21 and 22 most recently a continuous decomposition of the 2 torus into pseudo circles was given by be guin crovisier and jger that is invariant under a homeomorphism of the torus semi conjugate to an irrational circle rotation in the present paper relying on handel s construction we adapt and modify the results of be guin crovisier and le roux 4 to the very fine and complex structure of the pseudo circle to provide a counterexample to the aforementioned conjecture theorem 1 1 the pseudo circle admits minimal noninvertible maps the results of 4 that are discussed in more detail in section 3 are a far reaching generalization of the denjoy rees technique 13 30 that allowed rees to construct the first examples of minimal torus homeomorphisms with positive entropy these results are crucial to our construction however it should be noted that our proof is not a mere application of very general results of 4 for manifolds to a special case of a particular 1 dimensional pathological fractal quite a lot of care and effort is needed to make sure that the construction will not change the underlying space that is the pseudo circle into a different one dimensional space a naive approach would be to blow up an orbit of handel s minimal homeomorphism contained in the pseudo circle to a null sequence of pseudo arcs and then use this new homeomorphism with an asymptotic pair to obtain a minimal noninvertible map in this approach one could think in particular of a straightforward application of the following proposition from 4 proposition 1 2 be guin crovisier le roux 4 let r be a homeomorphism on a compact manifold m and x a point of m which is not periodic under r consider a compact subset d of m which can be written as the intersection of a strictly decreasing sequence dn n n of tamely embedded topological closed balls then there exist a homeomorphism f m m and a continuous onto map m m such that f r and such that 1 x d 1 y is a single point if y does not belong to the r orbit of x however this is not sufficient to obtain our result the problem again is that inserting the pseudo arcs ad hoc does not guarantee that the resulting space will not change as there is even no guarantee that such an insertion would allow these pseudo arcs to have empty interior in the resulting space as is required for minimal map on pseudo circle 3 the pseudo circle moreover even if one can ensure that the special nontrivial fibres indeed have empty interior in the new space one still has to ensure that the insertion is such that the resulting space remains circle like i e it can be covered by circular chains of arbitrarily small mesh see section 2 for precise definitions instead we were lead to an adjustment of the method in 4 see the comments preceding lemma 3 4 for more details and combine it with a careful analysis of the hereditary indecomposable structure of the pseudo circle to that end the notion of an internal composant introduced by krasinkiewicz in 24 came in handy see section 4 nevertheless our construction made us appreciate the denjoy rees technique as presented in 4 even more and there are clearly other novel applications of it to come acknowledgements the authors are grateful to fre de ric le roux for his com ments on the constructions in 4 j p boron ski was

institut de france a project coordinated by marcelo viana 2 preliminaries and some previous constructions in this section we define the notation and terms we use as well as recall some results from the literature that are used in the arguments 2 1 basic notation in topology and dynamics for any planar set e we denote by int e the interior of the set e we work with the closed annulus a s 1 0 1 and its lift to a r 0 1 with denoting the lift function from a to a given a family e of connected subsets of a define 2 1 mesh e max diam x x e for any family e of subsets of a denote by s e the union of all the elements of e called the realization of e a non degenerate continuum is a compact connected metric space which contains at least two elements we call a continuum planar if it can be embedded into the plane a continuum x is called indecomposable if x is not the union of two proper subcontinua a continuum is hereditarily indecomposable if every subcontinuum of it is also indecomposable for any x x the composant of x denoted c x is the union of all proper subcontinua in x containing x in any indecomposable continuum each composant is a dense first category connected set in x and if x y are points in x then either c x c y or c x c y definition 2 1 let x be a planar continuum a composant c of x is called in ternal if every continuum l intersecting both c and the complement of x intersects all composants of x 4 jan p boron ski judy kennedy xiao chuan liu and piotr oprocha we will need the following theorem proved by krasinkiewicz see main theorems of 24 and 25 lemma 2 2 for any indecomposable planar continuum x the union of all the internal composants is a g subset of x in particular every indecomposable planar continuum contains an internal composant let f x x g y y be two homeomorphisms on compact metric spaces x and y respectively let x y be a continuous surjective map satisfying f g in this case we say is a semi conjugacy between x f and y g the map x y is called monotone if for any y y 1 y is connected we say the semi conjugacy is almost 1 1 if there exists a residual subset y 1 y such that for each y y 1 1 y is a singleton given a monotone map x y the partition space 1 y y y is known to be upper semi continuous i e each set 1 y is closed in x and for any open set u in x the union of all 1 y contained in u is open we need the following well known properties for upper semi continuous decompositions see for example proposition 1 and proposition 2 in chapter 1 of 12 lemma 2 3 let x y be such that 1 y y y forms an upper semi continuous decomposition of x then the following hold 1 for any open set u containing some pre image 1 y 0 the set w y u 1 y is open 2 suppose a sequence of closed sets 1 yn x converges to a x in the hausdorff topology then for any x a a 1 x a moore decomposition of the closed annulus a is an upper semi continuous decomposition m such that any m m is contained in a topological disk the following is the classic moore s theorem lemma 2 4 section 25 theorem 1 in 12 for any moore decomposition m on a the partition space is again a moreover there exists a continuous monotone surjection a a such that the preimage of each point is precisely one element m m 2 2 circular chains and pseudo circles let zm denote the finite additive abelian group zm 0 m 1 for any two elements i j zm we use the convenient notation for their distance more precisely denote i j min i j m i j definition 2 5 for m 3 a circular chain is a finite family of open subset d d zm not necessarily connected such that 2 2 d dk 6 if and only if k 1 each element d is called a link definition 2 6 let d d zm and c c zs be two circular chains we say d is crooked inside c if there exists a map zm zs with the following properties i for any i zm the closure of di is contained in c i minimal map on pseudo circle 5 ii with properly chosen circular orders let i j be two elements in zm such that i j suppose for any i k j i k j then there exist i u v j such that i v 1 2 3 j u 1 2 4 we call a continuum x circle like if for any 0 x can be covered by a circular chain c with mesh c definition 2 7 see 5 and see 15 for the uniqueness part the pseudo circle is the unique circle like plane separating continuum that can be covered by a de creasing family of circular chains cn n 1 such that cn 1 is crooked inside cn for each n 0 and mesh cn 0 as n tends to remark 2 8 alternatively the pseudo circle can also be characterised as circle like hereditarily indecomposable plane separating continuum which can be embedded in any two dimensional manifold see 6 remark 2 9 a pseudo arc is similarly defined replacing the objects circular chain and circle like continua by linear chain and arc like continua respectively for precise definitions see for example the book 29 here we want to mention several important facts first the pseudo arc is also unique up to homeomorphism see 5 then it follows from both definitions that any non degenerate proper subcontinuum of a pseudo circle is a pseudo arc another useful fact is that any non degenerate subcontinuum of a pseudo arc is also a pseudo arc this is the main theorem of 28 we also need the following theorem from 19 lemma 2 10 theorem 3 of 19 let f be a homeomorphism of the pseudo circle p let c be a composant of p and suppose f c c then f admits a fixed point in c 2 3 the denjoy rees technique settings denote by a s 1 0 1 for the closed annulus let f a a be a homeomorphism which preserves both the orientation and the boundaries the following definitions are adopted from 4 definition 2 11 for an integer p 1 a finite family e of closed disks contained in s 1 0 1 is called p iterable if for any x y e and integers p k s p either fk x fs y or fk x fs y for any p iterable family of closed disks e and any 0 n p we denote 2 5 en k n fk e where f e f x x e for any 0 n p define an oriented graph g en where the vertices are elements of en and there is an edge from x to y if and only if f x y for a map h such that h x x and h y y we say that it commutes with f along edge x y if f h x h f x definition 2 12 let e f be two finite families of closed disks all contained in the open set s 1 0 1 we say f refines e if the following conditions hold 1 every element of e contains at least one element of f 6 jan p boron ski judy kennedy xiao chuan liu and piotr oprocha 2 for any x e y f either x y or y int x definition 2 13 let e f be two families of closed disks for an integer p 0 we say f is compatible with e for p iterates if the following conditions hold 1 e is p iterable 2 f is p 1 iterable 3 s f s e and fp 1 refines ep 4 for every k with k p 2 6 s fp 1 fk s e fk s f let e n n 0 denote a sequence of families of closed disks the following list of hypotheses was formulated in section 2 of 4 a 1 for every n 0 a e n is n 1 iterable and the graph g en n has no cycle b en 1 n refines em 1 m for any 0 m n c e n is compatible with e n 1 for n iterates a 2 the following holds 2 7 lim n mesh en n 0 next we want to choose a sequence of homeomorphisms hn n 1 such that the following hold for every n 1 b 1 the closure x hn x 6 x is contained in the set s en 1 n 1 b 2 hn and f commute along edges of the graph g en 1 n 1 b 3 the following holds 2 8 lim n mesh h 11 h 1 n 1 e n 1 n en 1 n 0 whenever we have such a sequence of homeomorphisms hn for any n 1 we define the homeomorphisms n gn as follows n hn h 1 2 9 gn 1 n f n 2 10 finally we set 0 id and g 0 f 2 4 the denjoy rees technique results the following results proved in 4 form the starting point of our proof they ensure proper convergence of the sequence of conjugated homeomorphisms while the conjugacies converge to a con tinuous map which provides a semi conjugacy later we will have to adjust this approach when defining maps hn to ensure sufficiently fast convergence this will be possible due to different approach to sets xn in 2 11 for purposes of 4 sets xn were specified as the beginning and then the sequence was refined sufficiently fast unfortunately this approach is likely to lead to a situation as on fig 1 de stroying chainablity or other properties to deal with this problem sets xn will be defined dynamically as the construction progresses and so the continuum in the fiber is unknown to the very end of the construction lemma 2 14 proposition 3 1 in 4 assume that hypotheses a 1 a 2 b 1 b 2 b 3 are satisfied then 1 the sequence n n 0 converges uniformly to a continuous surjective map a a minimal map on pseudo circle 7 figure 1 fiber nowhere dense in t 2 but large in blown up continuum 2 the sequences gn n 1 and g 1 n n 1 converge uniformly to a homeomor phism g a a and its inverse g 1 respectively 3 the homeomorphism f is semi conjugate to g via the map lemma 2 15 proposition 3 4 in 4 assume that hypotheses a 1 a 2 b 1 b 2 b 3 are satisfied let k n 0 s e n 1 suppose x a and there exists m z such that x fm k let xn n m e m n denote the decreasing sequence of closed disks containing x then 2 11 1 x n m 1 n xn 2 for every x which does not belong to the orbit of k 1 x is a singleton 3 minimal non invertible map on the pseudo circle the main result of this section is the following theorem theorem 3 1 there exists a homeomorphism f a a with an invariant pseudo circle q a such that q f is minimal and there exists a pseudo arc a q such that 3 1 lim n diam fn a 0 the proof of theorem 3 1 goes through the whole section in fact we will prove more than the statement here we will provide a semi conjugacy between two annulus homeomorphisms the conclusion of the theorem is based on the existence of such a semi conjugacy let us give an outline before getting into details in section 3 1 we recall handel s construction of an annulus homeomorphism f which admits an invariant pseudo circle p a then we construct the semi conjugacy in section 3 2 between a f and a g for some other homeomorphism g on a this is the most delicate part of the construction in section 3 3 we show the pre image of p under the semi conjugacy is still a pseudo circle and finally the rest of the proof of theorem 3 1 is given in section based on theorem 3 1 the proof of theorem 1 1 is given in section 4 8 jan p boron ski judy kennedy xiao chuan liu and piotr oprocha 3 1 minimal homeomorphism on the pseudo circle here we define a home omorphism f on the closed annulus a which preserves a minimal invariant pseudo circle p the construction follows directly from 17 so we refer to this paper for more details and some pictures for the construction roughly speaking the pseudo circle in construction in 17 is obtained as a nested sequence of annuli an nulus in n th step of the construction is identified with s 1 0 1 and then circle s 1 is split into exactly mn sub intervals of equal lengths say i 0 1 i 0 m 0 this way we define circular chain cn taking consecutive link of the form i 0 k i 0 k 1 0 1 for k 1 mn 1 and putting as the last i 0 mn i 0 1 0 1 this allows us to express the main result of 17 in the following form lemma 3 2 let a s 1 0 1 there exists a sequence of circular chains cn n 0 with links whose closures are closed discs and a homeomorphism f a a with the following properties 1 the following conditions are satisfied s c 0 s 1 0 1 3 2 s cn 1 s cn for any n 0 3 3 2 there is an f invariant minimal pseudo circle p such that 3 4 p n 0 s cn n 0 s cn 3 2 construction of the semi conjugacy in this subsection we construct the semi conjugacy the main tool from this subsection is lemma 3 4 lemma 3 3 for the homeomorphism f a a constructed in lemma 3 2 there exists a sequence of pseudo arcs a 0 a 1 contained in p such that 3 5 lim n diam an 0 moreover for all n 0 each an 1 is contained in an internal composant of an in particular n 0 an is a singleton containing a unique point called p proof by lemma 2 2 there exists an internal composant in p so we can choose a 0 p to be a pseudo arc in p with diameter smaller than 2 1 which is contained in an internal composant of p then for the same reason we can choose a 1 to be a pseudo arc contained in some internal composant of a 0 of diameter less than 2 2 inductively we can choose a sequence of pseudo arcs namely an n 1 such that for any n 0 the diameter diam an is smaller than 2 n and each an 1 is contained in an internal composant of an the proof is completed now we will perform a construction inspired by 4 for our proofs it is essential to have both conditions 3 10 and 3 11 below satisfied and have a pseudoarc in one of the fibres to do it following a scheme from 4 we would start with a continuum a p that we want to have in a fibre and then we use a decreasing family of its neighborhoods un such that nun a however if one checks the details carefully then it becames evident that in this approach always one of the conditions 3 10 or 3 11 will be broken and it is impossible to satisfy them simultanously therefore we need an adjustment in the construction the idea here is that we do not fix the seqence un apriori but construct it inductively un 1 can be defined after h 1 hn are known in the process we have to ensure that the sequence of minimal map on pseudo circle 9 connected open set un is nested i e un 1 un and continuum obtained at the end a nun is within the family of continua that we are interested in in our case the pseudo arc these are main issues where we have to be especially careful lemma 3 4 denote by f p and p the objects obtained in lemmas 3 2 and 3 3 then there exist homeomorphisms hn on a such that if we denote n hn h 1 3 6 gn 1 n f n 3 7 the the following limits exist in the topology of uniform convergence g lim n gn 3 8 lim n n 3 9 and dynamical system a f is a factor of a g by the factor map for every x a not in orbit of p i e fn x 6 p for every n z the set 1 x is a singleton 1 p is a pseudoarc and additionally there is an increasing sequence k such that h 1 1 s ck 1 s ck 3 10 mesh h h 1 1 ck 2 3 11 for every 1 proof let p nan p be pseudo arcs provided by lemma 3 3 recall that in the construction of f in lemma 3 2 we have chosen a sequence of circular chains cn n 0 such that p n 0 s cn then define vn to be an element contained in cn which contains p we also requite refining sequence cn when necessary that the elements of f i vn n 2 i n 2 are pairwise disjoint and the sequence vn is nested as u 0 we take a neighborhood of the pseudo arc a 0 such that u 0 s c 0 and f i u 0 2 i 2 has pairwise disjoint elements further sets un will be defined induc tively regarding lemmas 2 14 and 2 15 we define inductively the following objects 1 the sequence of families of closed disks denoted by e n n 0 satisfying conditions a 1 and a 2 in section 2 3 2 the sequence of homeomorphisms hn n 1 on the annulus a satisfying conditions b 1 b 2 b 3 in section 2 3 we start by setting e 0 u 0 and k 0 0 it is immediate from definition that e 0 satisfies conditions of a 1 only item a of a 1 needs to be checked for n 0 note that 3 12 e 1 0 f 1 u 0 u 0 f u 0 let u u u 0 be another neighborhood of a 0 such that u is homeomorphic to a closed disc and is contained in the union of links of a chain cover of a 0 by discs of diameter at most 2 1 in other words we may treat u as an open set and as a chain cover take any integers s 1 0 such that vs 1 u 10 jan p boron ski judy kennedy xiao chuan liu and piotr oprocha then we define the homeomorphism h 1 a a with the following properties h 1 u vs 1 3 13 h 1 p p 3 14 h 1 restricted to a u 0 is the identity 3 15 note that the condition b 1 for n 1 follows from 3 15 condition b 2 is empty for n 1 denote diama 0 2 let k 1 0 be an integer large enough so that mesh h 11 ck 1 2 1 and put uk 1 u define now 3 16 e 1 vs 1 by definition e 1 is s 1 1 iterable and s 1 1 it also follows that e 2 1 refines e 1 0 and e 1 is compatible with e 0 for 1 iterate in other words the three conditions in a 1 are all satisfied for n 1 now we will proceed with main construction which will be repeated inductively take any m k 1 s 1 sufficiently large so that if r 3 p is a link of cm then the sets f i r i 3 s 1 3 s 1 are pairwise disjoint and r vs 1 let s be any integer such that as r since in the definition of h 1 we only require 3 13 and 3 14 we can freely modify it on points of uk 1 a 0 that is we may assume that diamh 1 1 as is arbitrarily close to diamuk 1 in particular exceeds note that as p s cm let m m be such that f i s cm s cm for i 1 and meshh 11 cm 2 2 we also assume that h 11 cm 1 defines a chain cover of h 1 1 as which is a refine ment of u treated as a chain recall that cm is crooked inside cm 1 by definition let p w w uk 1 be a neighborhood of h 1 1 as obtained as the union of elements of a 2 2 chain cover of the pseudoarc h 11 as consisting of elements of h 11 cm since links of cm are connected w is connected as well if we view uk 1 and w as chains then we may assume that w is 1 4 chain crooked inside uk 1 in particular it intersects all links that uk 1 is union of let w be an open neighborhood of as such that w is homeomorphic to a closed disc and as w w h 1 w vs 1 and take any s 2 m k 1 s 1 such that vs 2 w recall that the elements of f i vs 2 i 2 are pairwise disjoint sets then we can define the homeomorphism h 2 satisfying the following properties h 2 w vs 2 3 17 h 2 p p 3 18 h 2 commutes with f on i 1 f i h 1 w 3 19 h 2 restricted to a 1 i 1 f i h 1 w is the identity 3 20 minimal map on pseudo circle 11 for 3 19 note that the sets f 1 vs 1 vs 1 and f vs 1 are pairwise disjoint so first we define the restriction of h 2 to w and then extend it to vs 1 so that h 2 vs 1 h 1 w is the identity next put f i h 2 vs 1 f i for i 1 and finally put h 2 x x for all other points x a this way a homeomorphism h 2 on a is defined which satisfies 3 19 and 3 20 now take k 2 sufficiently large so that h 12 s ck 2 s ck 1 3 21 mesh h 2 h 1 1 ck 2 2 2 3 22 and put uk 2 h 1 1 w as long as 3 22 is fairly easy to satisfy 3 21 is possible since x h 2 x 6 x i 1 f i h 1 w i 1 f i s cm s cm s ck 1 in particular h 12 p s ck 1 note that uk 2 is connected so we also may view it as a chain with links induced by w to finish the construction put 3 23 e 2 vs 2 directly from the definition of h 2 conditions b 1 and b 2 are satisfied for n 2 sets f i vs 2 are pairwise disjoint for i s 2 and s 2 4 so we obtain that e 2 is at least 4 iterable since vs 2 is a neighborhood of p it is easy to satisfy the requirement that e 3 2 refines e 2 1 and clearly also e 2 is compatible with e 1 for 2 iterates summing up the three conditions in a 1 are easily satisfied for n 2 assume now that for i 1 2 n we have already defined increasing sequences si ki open sets uki and maps hi a a such that hi p p and 1 uki uki uki 1 h 1 hi uki vsi and for some s sn we have as vsn and diam h 1 hn 1 as 2 e n vsn and conditions a 1 b 1 b 2 and b 3 are satisfied for each i n 3 each uki is homeomorphic to a closed disc we can present each set uki as a union of elements of a 1 2 i chain and under this representation uki is crooked in uki 1 4 the following conditions are satisfied h 1 i 1 s cki s cki 1 3 24 mesh hi h 1 1 cki 2 i 3 25 take any m kn sn sufficiently large so that if r 3 p is a link of cm then sets f i r i 3 sn 3 sn are pairwise disjoint and r vsn let r be any integer such that ar r the only requirements on hn are that hn p p and hn hn 1 h 1 ukn vsn furthermore ar as vsn and diam hn h 1 1 as therefore we may adjust definition of hn on the set hn 1 h 1 ukn in such a way that also diam hn h 1 1 ar and all other assumed properties hold in particular we have to adjust it also on some images of ukn so that commutativity in b 2 remains satisfied note that ar p s cm let m m be such that f i s cm s cm for i n and mesh hn h 1 1 cm 2 n 1 12 jan p boron ski judy kennedy xiao chuan liu and piotr oprocha we also assume that hn h 1 1 cm 1 defines a chain cover of hn h 1 1 ar which is a refinement of ukn treated as a chain let p w w ukn be a neighborhood of hn h 1 1 ar obtained as the union of elements of a 2 n 1 chain cover of the pseudoarc hn h 1 1 ar consisting of elements of hn h 1 1 cm since links of cm are connected w is connected as well if we view ukn and w as chains then we may assume that w is 2 n 1 chain crooked inside ukn in particular intersects all links that ukn is union of let w be an open neighborhood of ar such that w is homeomorphic to a closed disc and ar w w hn h 1 w vsn and take any sn 1 m kn sn such that vsn 1 w recall that the elements of f i vsn 1 i n 1 are pairwise disjoint sets then we can define the homeomorphism hn 1 satisfying the following properties hn 1 w vsn 3 26 hn 1 p p 3 27 hn 1 commutes with f on i n f i hn w 3 28 hn 1 restricted to a n i n f i hn w is the identity 3 29 for 3 28 note that the sets f i vsn i n are pairwise disjoint so first we define the restriction of hn 1 to hn w vsn extend it by identity to vsn put f i hn 1 vsn f i for i n n and finally put hn 1 x x for all other points x a in this way a homeomorphism hn 1 on a which satisfies 3 28 is defined now take kn 1 sufficiently large so that h 1 n 1 s ckn 1 s ckn 3 30 mesh hn 1 h 1 1 ckn 1 2 n 1 3 31 and put ukn 1 hn 1 h 1 1 w note that ukn 1 contains hn h 1 1 ar in particular diam ukn 1 as before 3 31 is easy to satisfy and 3 30 is possible because x hn 1 x 6 x i nf i hn h 1 w i nf i s cm s cm s ckn in particular h 1 n 1 p s ckn note that ukn 1 is connected so we also may view it as a chain with links induced by w additionally modifying hn 1 accordingly on ukn 1 we may assume that there is s 0 such that as vsn 1 such that diam hn 1 h 1 1 as to finish the construction put 3 32 e n 1 vsn 1 directly from the definition of hn 1 conditions b 1 and b 2 are satisfied for n 1 sets f i vsn 1 are pairwise disjoint for i sn 1 and sn 1 2 n 1 we obtain that e n 1 is at least 2 n 1 iterable since vsn 1 is a neighborhood of p it is easy to satisfy the requirement that en 2 n 1 refines en 1 n and clearly also e n 1 minimal map on pseudo circle 13 is compatible with e n for n 1 iterates summing up the three conditions in a 1 are easily satisfied for n 1 this completes the induction since family of sets vn intersects in a single point condition a 2 is satisfied proving all the properties claimed for the construction define for all n 1 n hn h 1 3 33 gn 1 n f n 3 34 then we apply lemma 2 14 to obtain a homeomorphism g and a semi conjugacy as the limits g lim n gn 3 35 lim n n 3 36 observe that the set a nukn is continuum as intersection of decreasing family of continua all of diameter at least as we announced in the construction all sets ukn can be viewed as 2 n chains so a is chainable and each ukn 1 is crooked inside ukn so a is hereditarily indecomposable therefore a pseudoarc see 5 now we apply lemma 2 15 obtaining that 1 y is a singleton for any y fn p n z 3 37 1 p n 0 1 n vsn n 0 ukn a 3 38 the proof of lemma 3 4 is completed 3 3 properties of blow up of p in this subsection we prove the following theorem 3 5 let denote the semi conjugacy map a obtained by construction in lemma 3 4 and denote q 1 p then q is a pseudo circle before we can prove the above result we again need some preparation recall that by lemma 3 4 all preimages 1 x for x a are connected so is a monotone map it follows immediately that q is a continuum lemma 3 6 the pseudo arc a 1 p q is nowhere dense in q proof suppose to the contrary that a contains interior in q equivalently there exists an open subset w s 1 0 1 such that w q 6 and w q w a now we consider some connected component u of w q which is open we can choose an arc 0 1 w connecting some point in u to u q more precisely we can define 0 1 w such that 0 a and 0 1 u in particular 0 1 q then 0 1 is a homeomorphism and by the construction of see lemma 3 4 0 p while 0 1 p however 0 1 w is an arc containing both p and some point in the complement of p since p is contained in an internal composant of p 0 1 intersects all composants of p in particular it contains many points of p which is a contradiction the proof of the lemma is completed lemma 3 7 there exists a dense g subset i q such that for every point x i 3 39 1 x x 14 jan p boron ski judy kennedy xiao chuan liu and piotr oprocha proof note that f q q q is a homeomorphism and by lemma 3 6 a is nowhere dense in q thus fn a is nowhere dense for all n z consider the set n z f n a which is a countable union of nowhere dense closed sets denote the complement by i q n z f n a then by the baire category theorem i as an intersection of a sequence of open and dense sets is a dense g set moreover it follows from 3 37 and 3 38 that for any x i 3 40 1 x x the proof is completed lemma 3 8 q is an indecomposable continuum proof suppose to the contrary that q is decomposable then we can write q k l where k and l are proper subcontinua of q it follows that k and l are two subcontinua of p as well as p k l since p is indecomposible it follows either k or l is equal to p suppose without loss of generality that l p now recall that k l q l 6 is open in q so by lemma 3 7 there exists x k l i where i q n z f n a in particular 1 x x on the other hand by assumption that l p there always exists y l such that y x this provides a contradiction thus q is indecomposable lemma 3 9 the continuum q is hereditarily indecomposable proof by comparing definitions let us first point out the fact that the composants of q are precisely the preimages of the composants of p under the semi conjugacy suppose to the contrary that a non degenerate subcontinuum m q is decom posable by lemma 3 8 m is proper hence q m is open in q and by lemma 3 7 q m i 6 where i q n z f n a restricted to which the semi conjugacy is 1 to 1 in particular m 6 p so m is a proper subcontinuum of p it fol lows that m is either a singleton or a pseudo arc it is not hard to see that m can not be a singleton because otherwise by the construction of m fn a for some n z then as a non degenerate subcontinuum of the pseudo arc fn a by remark 2 9 m itself has to be a pseudo arc which is indecomposable now we suppose m is a pseudo arc by assumption there are proper sub continua k and l of m such that k l m it follows that k and l are two subcontinua of m which in turn is a subcontinuum of p they satisfy 3 41 k l m since m is hereditarily indecomposible either l or k is equal to m let us assume l m for definiteness then for any x k l there exists some y l such that x y it follows that x i i e there exists some n z such that x fn a lemma 3 8 tells us q is indecomposable now by lemma 2 10 f q is fixed point free which implies that no two members of the sequence fn a n z of pseudo arcs belong to the same composant of q thus k l is contained in fn a for some n z up to composing by f n if necessary we simply assume that k l a since k l m l is open in m there is some nonempty open set w s 1 0 1 minimal map on pseudo circle 15 such that w k l w m 6 3 42 w l 3 43 since k l p as in the proof of lemma 3 6 we can find some arc 0 1 w such that 0 a 3 44 0 1 m 3 45 since m is a pseudo arc in p containing the point p for each i z it follows ai m 6 since the sets ai are pseudo arcs it follows either ai m or m ai since by corollary 3 11 limn diam an 0 there is k 0 such that ak m now by lemma 3 3 ak 1 ak contains p and ak 1 is in an internal composant of ak thus denote 0 1 which is an arc in a containing the point p since is in an internal composant of ak it must intersect all the composants of ak then there exists y ak with y 6 p but y m and there is some x m such that x y then x l because otherwise x p but then x w l which is a contradiction to 3 43 so q is hereditarily indecomposable and the proof is completed lemma 3 10 the continuum q is circle like and separates a proof by the construction denote by ck k 0 for the defining sequence of circular chains for p and let hn n 0 and n n 0 be the sequence of homeomorphisms constructed in lemma 3 4 since the sequence mesh ck k 0 converges to 0 we can choose an increasing integer subsequence kj j 0 such that k 0 0 and for any j 0 we have h 1 j 1 s ckj 1 s ckj 3 46 mesh 1 j 1 ckj 1 2 j 3 47 now we denote dj ckj for all j 0 for simplicity of the notation we will write n instead of kn clearly 1 n dn n 0 is a sequence of circular chains and 3 46 show inductively this sequence is in fact decreasing by 3 47 it follows that the continuum n 0 s dn is circle like so we are left to show the following 3 48 q n 0 1 n s dn choose any x n 0 1 n s dn by the choice n x s dn for all n 0 noting 3 36 and 3 3 it follows that x s dn for each n 0 thus 3 49 x n 0 s dn p then x 1 x 1 p q and so n 0 1 s dn q next suppose q n 0 1 n s dn is a proper subcontinuum of q by defi nition n p p for all n 1 and therefore 1 n p p 1 n s dn for each n 0 which yields that p q then q as a proper subcontinuum of q must be contained in the composant c p of q that contains p then q is a proper 16 jan p boron ski judy kennedy xiao chuan liu and piotr oprocha subcontinuum of p so q is either a pseudo arc or a singleton in particular q does not separate a on the other hand we know s d 0 separates a more precisely the set a s d 0 has two connected components and we call them s and t respectively since q is not separating there exists an arc 0 1 a such that 0 s and 1 t and 0 1 q let l 1 0 1 then l is a continuum contained in s 1 0 1 moreover 3 50 l q however l 1 n s dn 6 for any n 0 since it intersects both s and t then for any n 0 we choose yn l 1 n s dn by extracting a subsequence if necessary we can assume the sequence yn n 0 converges to a point y l we can also deduce from 3 46 the following for all n k 1 1 n s dn 1 n 1 h 1 n s dn 3 51 1 n 1 s dn 1 1 k s dk therefore yn 1 k s dk for any n k 0 it follows that y 1 k s dk for all n 0 thus y l q which is a contradiction to 3 50 this contradiction shows q q we have completed the proof of the lemma end of proof of proposition 3 5 it follows directly from lemma 3 9 lemma 3 10 and the characterization stated in remark 2 8 that q is a pseudo circle corollary 3 11 let f a a be the homeomorphism given in lemma 3 2 with semiconjugacy a g a f mapping the pseudo circle q onto the pseudo circle p provided by lemma 3 4 then for the pseudo arc a 1 p we have 3 52 lim n diam gn a 0 proof note that the semi conjugacy on a can be regarded as a continuous map from q to p suppose to the contrary that for some integer subsequence nk k 0 and some 0 every pseudo arc fnk a has diameter at least let us fix some point x q such that 3 53 1 x x by minimality of f on p we can extract a further subsequence if necessary still called nk k 0 such that gnk a converges to some set k containing x by defi nition gn a 1 fn p and so by lemma 2 3 1 x k however k has diameter at least which is a contradiction with 3 53 proof of theorem 3 1 we have already proved in theorem 3 5 that q is a pseudo circle by lemma 3 6 any iterate gn a has empty interior in q for any n z thus the set q n z g n a is a dense g subset of q this means that the set of points y q such that 1 y y is a dense g set in particular is an almost 1 to 1 semi conjugacy between q g and p f therefore it follows immediately that q g is minimal since p f is minimal see for example 16 equation 3 1 was established in corollary 3 11 the proof is completed minimal map on pseudo circle 17 4 proof of the main theorem in this section we finish the proof of our main result it seems that it is known that a monotone image of the pseudo circle is homeomorphic to it see e g p 91 27 but for completness we provide a short justification below proposition 4 1 suppose a a is a monotone continuous surjective map assume there is a non degenerate continuum y a such that 1 y p then y is a pseudo circle proof we need to show that y is circle like plane separating and hereditarily indecomposable it is well known that a monotone image of a circle like continuum is circle like see e g lemma 9 26 moreover y is non degenerate and 1 y p is plane separating by the continuity of it is immediate that y is also plane separating it remains to show that y is hereditarily indecomposable but this is also immediate since if a subcontinuum k of y were decomposable then 1 k would also be a decomposable continuum resulting in a contradiction this shows that y is a pseudo circle theorem 1 1 follows directly from the following statement theorem 4 2 there exists a continuous surjection g a a with an invariant pseudo circle p a such that g p is minimal but is not one to one proof let g a a denote the homeomorphism provided by proposition 3 1 minimal on pseudo circle q and let a q be the associated pseudo arc define the equivalence relation in a such that x y if and only if either x y or x y gn a for some n 0 since by proposition 3 1 4 1 lim n diam gn a 0 it follows that is a closed equivalence relation with connected equivalence classes moreover it is not hard to see the family of equivalence classes form a upper semi continuous family thus by moore s theorem see lemma 2 4 there exists a semi conjugacy a a which collapses each equivalence class into one point in a then it induces a map g a a such that g g note that g is continuous non invertible surjection and a g a g is a monotone surjective continuous map a factor map clearly g must be minimal then by proposition 4 1
