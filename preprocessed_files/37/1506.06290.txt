study the unitary boundary representation of a strongly transitive group acting on a right angled hyperbolic building we show its irreducibility we do so by associating to such a representation a representation of a certain hecke algebra which is a deformation of the classical representation of a hyperbolic reflection group we show that the associated hecke algebra representation is irreducible 0 introduction considering the group sl 2 r as the isometry group of the hyperbolic plane and the circle s 1 as its boundary one is led to study various unitary representations of sl 2 r on the function space l 2 s 1 the so called principal series representations it is well known that these representations are irreducible and constitute a sizable part of the unitary dual of sl 2 r this fundamental fact inspired many authors who obtained various generalizations for example one may replace the field r with a non archimedean local field and the group sl 2 with an arbitrary semi simple algebraic group important tools in the study of the representations thus obtained are the associated affine building and the so called iwahori hecke algebra see iw im hm in another course of generalization taken in cs see also ftp fts gar 1 bk the authors consider discrete subgroups and show for example that the restriction of the principal sl 2 r representations on l 2 s 1 to the subgroup w generated by the reflections across the sides of a compact right angled polygon is still irreducible our current contribution links the previous two routes we consider a group acting on a building and its unitary representation on l 2 of the boundary we use the aid of an associated hecke algebra representation in order to analyze this boundary representation it turns out that the associated hecke algebra representation could be seen as a deformation of the unitary representation of w alluded to above we prove the irreducibility of this deformed representation using the tools developed in bm see also the recent generalization gar 2 our exact theorem is theorem 0 1 let x be a right angled lobachevsky hyperbolic building of finite thickness let g be a group acting strongly transitively on x the associated unitary representation of g on l 2 x is irreducible as mentioned above in the course of the proof of theorem 0 1 we reduce it to the following theorem which might be of independent interest theorem 0 2 let w be the group generated by the reflections across the codimension 1 faces of a compact right angled polytope in the hyperbolic n space fix real parameters qs indexed by the codimension 1 faces of the polytope and consider the corresponding iwahori hecke algebra h then the natural representation of h on l 2 sn 1 is irreducible provided that for every face s qs 1 the terms used in the formulations of the above theorems will be explained in the next sections in particular the unitary representations considered are the principal series representation with the trivial parameter 0 unfortunately the question whether other principal series representations are irreducible as well remains open the dimension of the buildings that we deal with is limited vinberg proved that compact right angled hyperbolic polytopes do not exist in dimensions 4 see dav cor 6 11 7 the paper is divided into three parts in part i we detail the setting of theorem 0 1 and explain its re duction to theorem 0 2 part ii describes explicitly the hecke algebra and its principal series representations finally in part iii we prove theorem 0 2 i representation on the boundary of the building 1 definition of principal series ub partially supported by the erc grant 306706 jd partially supported by polish ncn grant dec 2012 06 a st 1 00259 1 http arxiv org abs 1506 06290 v 1 in this section we define a series of unitary representations of a hyperbolic building automorphism group on the l 2 space of the boundary of the building let p be a bounded polytope with finitely many faces in a hyperbolic space hd suppose that all dihedral angles of p are of the form k k z then the set s of reflections across the codimension 1 faces of p generates a group w acting on hd called a hyperbolic coxeter group the action of w on hd is geometric cocompact and properly discontinuous the w translates of p have pairwise disjoint interiors and form a tessellation of hd let x be a building whose weyl group is a hyperbolic coxeter group w as above one can think of x as of a set of chambers with a w valued distance function one can also consider geometric realizations of x one of them will be the hyperbolic realization x with chambers isometric to p and apartments isometric to hd tessellated by copies of p as above codimension 1 faces of p correspond to elements of s this labeling extends consistently to codimension 1 faces in x the label of such face usually called its type in our tessellation of hd a codimension 1 face is shared by two chambers in a building there should be more of them and their number is called the thickness of the building along the face we assume that the thickness is finite and depends only on the type s of the face and we denote it qs 1 the thickness vector q qs s s encodes the thickness data if all qs are equal we interpret q as their common value this is the uniform thickness case in this paper all formulae are written as if thickness was uniform yet they can all be easily re interpreted to make sense for non uniform thickness comments explaining some details of this re interpretation will be given in 7 an automorphism of x is a bijection x x preserving the w valued distance it can be realized geometrically as an isometric map x x that map preserves types of codimension 1 faces finally we want a group g g aut x acting strongly transitively on x this means transitivity on the set of pairs chamber apartment the existence of a strongly transitive action implies that the thickness of the building along a face depends only on the type of that face the group g can be equipped with the compact open topology coming from its action on x we require g to be closed in this topology anyway passing to closure preserves strong transitivity then both g and g are locally compact totally discontinuous second countable generated by compact subgroups eg by stabilizers of codimension 1 faces of one chamber unimodular we normalize the haar measure on g by requiring that every chamber stabilizer has measure 1 all such stabilizers are conjugate the metric space x is cat 1 and has a compact gromov boundary x which we usually shorten to x the set x itself can be equipped with the gallery distance then it is quasi isometric to x and has the same gromov boundary the action of g on x extends to an action on x we will define a g quasi invariant measure on x and consider the associated family of unitary g and g representations on l 2 x we fix an isometric identification of hd along with p and the tessellation that it generates with the the poincare disc model dd we require that the center 0 of the model corresponds to an interior point of p also to be denoted 0 the action map of w to the orbit of 0 is a quasi isometry between w with the s word metric and hd or dd we use it to identify w hd and dd sd 1 hence we get a measure l on w corresponding to the lebesgue measure on the sphere for any chamber c x and any apartment a containing c the c based folding map identifies a with w pulling l back by this folding we get a measure lc on a the stabilizer gc of c in g has a probability haar measure c the map pc gc a b x 7 bx x is surjective by strong transitivity definition 1 1 1 1 c p c c lc c 0 for some fixed chamber c 0 note that c does not depend on the choice of a any different a c is of the form b a for some b gc then b x 7 b b 1 b x transforms one variant of c lc to the other while preserving fibres of pc on the other hand c does depend on the choice of c lemma 1 2 the measures c c are absolutely continuous with respect to each other for c c x lemma 1 3 for any g g and any chamber c x we have g c g c 2 in particular for any g g we get g gc 0 using this fact we now define the principal series of g lemmas 1 2 and 1 3 will be proved later definition 1 4 a let x be a hyperbolic building of finite thickness and let g be the group of all type preserving automorphisms of x assume that the action of g on x is strongly transitive the principal series of g is the family r of representations of g on l 2 x given by g f x f g 1 x d g d x 1 2 i b let g be a closed subgroups of g still acting strongly transitively on x the principal series of g is the restriction of the above to g remark in the definition of one could replace by any measure satisfying g however if h h l 1 then the representation associated to isometrically embeds in that corresponding to the intertwiner is given by 1 2 l 2 f 7 h 12 i f l 2 in particular if we replace c 0 by a different chamber we get an equivalent representation proof of lemma 1 3 let a be an apartment containing c we have a commutative diagram 1 3 gc a g g gg c ga y pc y pg c x g x where g denotes conjugation by g now 1 4 g c g p c c lc p g c g g c lc pg c g c lg c g c lemma 1 3 proof of lemma 1 2 we may assume that c and c are s adjacent for some given s we get the general statement by applying this special case along a gallery for convenience we will assume c c 0 as its choice was arbitrary and c c 1 where c 1 cq denote the s neighbors of c 0 let xi be the set of chambers that are closer to ci than to any other cj by xi we denote the set of points in x that are in the closure of xi we put i ci pi pci li lci gi gci we denote by j the cj based folding map x w as well as its extension x w for x w put r x d s l dl x lemma 1 5 fix an i 0 and let q qs then 1 5 i xi q r 0 0 xi proof we choose some apartment a containing c 0 and ci then a will be the support of both l 0 and li we put a 0 a x 0 ai a xi we will prove the following sequence of equalities 1 6 i xi pi gi li xi pi q gi g 0 li xi p 0 q gi g 0 li xi q r 0 p 0 g 0 l 0 xi q r 0 0 xi the first and last equality are immediate consequences of the definitions of i and 0 3 2 nd equality we have j 6 0 xj g 0 ai moreover the setwise stabilizer of xi in g 0 is g 0 gi therefore xi g 0 gi ai xi gi it follows that for cosets gi g 0 b b gi we have gi g 0 b ai xi in particular for each x ai we can choose a system bj j 1 2 q of representatives of right cosets of gi g 0 in gi such that bjx x let us pick a measurable u xi fix an x ai and a system bj as above for this x then 1 7 b gi bx u j b gi g 0 bx u bj since right multiplication by bj preserves the haar measure we have 1 8 b gi bx u q b gi g 0 bx u integrating this equality over ai with respect to li we get that p i gi li and pi q gi g 0 li agree on u 3 rd equality the pushed measure is supported on the intersection of the domains of p 0 and pi both maps are defined by the same formula 4 th equality we have s l rl and on a i s 0 in the following calculation the domains of 0 and i are restricted to a 1 9 li 1 i l s 0 1 l 1 0 s l 1 0 rl r 0 10 l r 0 l 0 on gi g 0 the measures g 0 and gi g 0 coincide p 0 maps the remaining part of g 0 ai outside xi lemma 1 5 to finish the proof of lemma 1 2 we use principles of symmetry first 1 10 i x 0 1 q r i q r i i x 0 1 q r i 0 x 0 1 q r s 0 0 x 0 q

that 0 and 0 corollary 1 6 suppose g and c 0 ci i 0 then 1 12 on xj j 6 0 i q r on xi q 1 r on x 0 remark 1 7 it is possible to deduce from corollary 1 6 a general formula for d c d c in terms of busemann functions in a metric space x one defines the gromov product x y z 12 z x z y x y if the space is hyperbolic and has boundary x we may try to extend the gromov product by putting x b z limy b x y z the limit is taken over a sequence of y x converging to b x the limit may not exist or may depend on the choice of the sequence of y s but in our cases of interest these problems will happen only for b in some zero measure set finally the busemann function is b x y x y 2 y b x for x y x b x in our case there are two metrics of interest on the building x 1 each chamber c x has a geometric realization c in x canonically isometric to the fundamental polytope p inside c there is a copy 0 c of the point 0 p we put c c 0 c 0 c the distance from 0 c to 0 c in x 2 the gallery distance c c is the length of a shortest gallery in x starting at c and ending at c 4 now we can state the formula 1 13 d c d c e d 1 b c c q b c c for c adjacent to c this formula reduces to corollary 1 6 the general case follows from this special case and the cocycle property of a busemann function 1 14 b x z b x y b y z as noticed by garncarek the right hand side of 1 13 can be rewritten as 1 15 exp d 1 b c c ln q b c c exp d 1 mixb c c where mix c c c c ln q d 1 c c this means that the measures c c x form a quasi conformal family with respect to the mix metric thus the results of gar 2 apply to our setting yielding in many cases a different proof of theorem 0 1 garncarek requires the group to be discrete his result can be applied to a cocompact lattice in g in the right angled case such a lattice exists in the automorphism group g and in many interesting subgroups g cf ct this remark holds also in the multi parameter case one replaces the gallery metric by a family s s s of pseudo metrics s c d is the number of s type codimension 1 faces traversed by a minimal gallery from c to c then the mix metric is defined as mix c c c c s s ln qs d 1 s c c 2 general nonsense suppose that v is a unitary representation of a locally compact group g and let k be a compact open subgroup of g then one defines the hecke algebra h g k as the convolution algebra of all compactly supported k bi invariant functions on g elements of h g k are continuous even locally constant because k is open they act on v by 2 1 f v g f g g v dg this action preserves the space of k invariants v k v v k k k v v due to left k invariance of f proposition 2 1 suppose that 1 v k is g cyclic in v ie v is the closure of the linear span of g v k 2 v k is hecke irreducible ie v k has no non trivial closed h g k invariant subspace then v is an irreducible g representation proof suppose not let v v 0 v 1 be a non trivial orthogonal decomposition into subrepresenta tions then v k v k 0 v k 1 the subspaces v k 0 and v k 1 are non zero if v k 0 was zero we would have g v k g v k 1 v 1 contradicting the cyclicity assumption similarly for v k 1 but this contradicts hecke irreducibility of v k the goal of part i is to establish g cyclicity of v k in our context to do that we need to recall certain facts about hyperbolic right angled buildings and their automorphism groups 3 right angled buildings a coxeter group w s is right angled if any two elements of s either commute or span an infinite dihedral subgroup of w a building is right angled if its weyl group is right angled a hyperbolic reflection group associated to a polyhedron p is right angled if all dihedral angles of p are 2 morphisms of right angled buildings are discussed at length in section 4 of do here we just summaries the results let x be a right angled building we fix a chamber c a set y x is star like with respect to c if every minimal gallery from c to any y y is contained in y we choose a well ordering on x 5 such that all initial segments x x are star like a morphism x x can be constructed inductively with respect to we first arbitrarily choose c if is defined on x x we try extend it to x two things can happen 1 freedom all minimal galleries from x to c are of the form x y c for some unique y then there is choice if s is the type of the common face of x and y then x can be chosen to be any of the s neighbors of y 2 determinism there are at least two minimal galleries from x to c starting differently x y c and x y c with y 6 y then there is a unique choice of x that extends the so far constructed part of to a morphism the values of y y and similar values given by other galleries consistently and uniquely determine x whether x falls into 1 or 2 depends only on w c x w we compare the s word lengths w and ws if w ws for just one s s then we are in case 1 otherwise we are in case 2 in do the set of all pairs y s as in case 1 is called the root set of x and denoted r x to check whether the constructed morphism is an automorphism we have the following criterion for each y s r x the map restricts to a bijection between the sets of s neighbors of y and of y in particular if the thickness of x is type dependent given by a thickness vector then a partial automorphism defined on an initial segment of x can always be extended to an automorphism to make use of the above procedure it is necessary to have well orderings with star like initial segments let us temporarily call them nice for buildings of finite thickness nice orderings are not hard to come by here are some examples any ordering compatible with gallery distance from c ie satisfying c x c y x y is nice for star like subsets a b of x we can put a nice ordering on a then extend it to a b so that a is an initial segment and then extend it to x keeping a b as an initial segment we will use this type of ordering for convex sets a b containing c any refinement of a nice ordering of w is nice by a refinement we mean an ordering on x satisfying x y c x c y finally we need to discuss standard open neighborhoods cf do section 2 let x be a hyperbolic right angled building with finite thickness and weyl group w we distinguish a chamber c 0 and denote by the c 0 based folding map pick any wall h in w let h is the completed wall ie the closure of h in w w consider the connected components of x x 1 h the ones that do not contain c 0 are called standard open neighborhoods every point p x has a basis of open neighborhoods in x x consisting of suitably chosen standard neighborhoods the intersections of sets from this basis with x form a basis of neighborhoods of p in x any standard open neighborhood u contains a unique minimal chamber a chamber x in u with minimal gallery distance to c 0 this x satisfies the freedom condition 1 conversely any chamber x satisfying 1 is the minimal chamber of a unique standard neighborhood to be denoted u x u x u x for the part in x u x for the part in x 4 invariants are cyclic the standing notation throughout the paper is as follows x is a right angled hyperbolic building of finite thickness q either uniform or multi parameter with gromov boundary x g is the type preserving automorphism group of x equipped with the compact open topology c 0 is a fixed chamber in x called the base chamber and k is the stabilizer of c 0 in g g is a closed subgroup of g acting strongly transitively on x we put k g k v is a principal series representation of g or its restriction to g in this section we prove that v k is g cyclic in v we first reduce to the case of g and k lemma 4 1 a v k v k more generally v gc v g c for any chamber c x b span g v k c x v gc span g v k proof we have x k w x k the quotient maps being in both cases since is measure preserving we get v k l 2 w l v k as hilbert spaces the isomorphisms given by precomposition with 6 for g g we have g v k v gkg 1 v ggc 0 to finish the proof of a let us choose a g g such that gc 0 c we then have v gc g v k g v k v g c part b follows as well 4 1 span g v k g g v ggc 0 c x v gc c x v g c g g v g gc 0 span g v k theorem 4 2 the linear span of g v k is dense in v proof assume by contradiction that span g v k c x v gc is not dense in v then there exists a non zero function f c x v gc the latter space being a closed g subrepresentation we may average f over a small subgroup of g and still get a non zero f in the same space in other words we may assume that f is invariant under gy the pointwise stabilizer of a sufficiently large finite subset y x we may assume and do assume that c 0 y it turns out that for diligently chosen chamber c x and open set u x the properties of gy invariance and gc invariance are equivalent on u then the function f u if non zero will be gc invariant and not perpendicular to f yielding a contradiction u is the characteristic function of u we proceed to the details let the gallery diameter of y be m consider the gallery distancem ball around 1 in w and the finitely many tessellation walls h in w that intersect the closed geometric realization of this ball the union of those walls w h gallery distance from 1 to h is m is closed in w w also w hd has zero lebesgue measure this set is a finite union of zero measure boundaries of walls we deduce that 1 w is closed in x and has measure zero it follows that there exists x x 1 w such that f has non zero restriction to every open neighborhood of x let us pick a standard open neighborhood u c u c of x in x x disjoint from the closed set 1 w lemma 4 3 for every g gc there exists g gc gy such that g u c g u c this lemma implies theorem 4 2 as follows the set u c is gc invariant every g gc preserves u c and f u c since so does g given by the lemma it follows that f u c v gc f f u c u c f 2 d 0 contradiction proof of lemma 4 4 we choose an apartment a containing c 0 and c the map a w is an isomorphism we can therefore move all the data the gallery m ball around 1 the set w from w to a in this proof it will be convenient to consider foldings onto a rather than w thus will denote the folding map x a fixing c 0 and c will fix c let h be the boundary wall of u c cut a along the walls h that intersect h let c be the component of c 0 in a h h h 6 by the definition of w the gallery m ball around c 0 in a is contained in c since c is a retraction y 1 c c we choose a well ordering on x starting in c so that chambers in u c form an initial segment chambers in 1 c c form the next segment all initial segments are star like then start defining the automorphism g by imposing g g on u c g id on 1 c c this defines a partial automorphism on an initial segment which extends to an automorphism of x lemma 4 4 theorem 4 2 ii right angled hecke algebra our goal in this part is to define and discuss the principal series representations of the hecke algebra on v k l 2 w elements of the hecke algebra h g k are compactly supported functions on g that are k bi invariant in other words they correspond to finitely supported functions on k g k which by the bruhat decomposition is naturally identified with w thus as vector spaces h g k c w the convolution multiplication in h g k does not correspond to the group algebra multiplication in c w but rather to its deformation described below in 5 1 the isomorphism is explained in bourb ch iv 2 ex 24 and in dav lemma 19 1 5 the source dav proves the result not only for the full automorphism group g but also for its strongly transitive subgroups g in 5 below we describe the hecke algebra structure on c w associated with an abstract choice of parameter q in 6 we study the representation of h g k on v k in both sections we consider only for the simplicity of the discussion the uniform thickness case q in 7 7 we will explain how to read through the previous sections while considering the non uniform thickness case we will also explain how to define the principal series representations for an arbitrary hecke algebra that is when considering complex parameters qs 5 multiplication in right angled hecke algebras in this section w s is a right angled coxeter group not necessarily hyperbolic the hecke algebra of w is the space h w wcew with c bilinear multiplication given by 5 1 esew esw if sw w q 1 ew qesw if sw w where w w and s s we can rewrite this as a formula for esf u where f h c w is treated as a finitely supported function on w 5 2 esf u qf su if su u q 1 f u f su if su u our first goal is to establish a similar formula for ewf without assuming that w is a generator the formula will hold for every right angled coxeter group regardless of its hyperbolicity definition 5 1 a for a d w we denote by p a d the set of walls in w separating a from d in w a wall divides w into two connected components this division induces a partition of the set of chambers hence of w into two parts this partition of w is the combinatorial meaning of a wall in w we shall often identify walls with the corresponding reflections in particular for s s and a wall reflection a we denote by as the wall s a the reflection sas for sets we put as as a a there is a natural poset structure on p a d h h if the half space bounded by h containing a is a subset of the half space bounded by h containing a b by ap a d we denote the set of anti chains in p a d notice that if h ap a d than any two elements of h commute the converse is also true a pairwise commuting family of wall reflections in p a d is an anti chain in p a d we denote by h the product of all elements of h the context will make the meaning clear observe that h 1 h c for h ap a d we define an interval a h as the set of all h p a d such that no h h is smaller than h a h h p a d h h h h notice that a p a d we define the height of h as ht h a h proposition 5 1 in the hecke algebra of a right angled coxeter group 5 3 ewf u h ap 1 u w q 1 hq w ht h f w 1 hu proof induction on w the length 1 case is covered by 5 2 now assume that the formula is true for w and that sw w we will deduce that the formula holds for sw there are two cases either su u or su u case 1 su u then 1 w and u are on the same side of the wall s we have 5 4 eswf u es ewf u q ewf su q h ap 1 su w q 1 hq w ht h f w 1 hsu while the postulated formula for eswf u is 5 5 h ap 1 u sw q 1 hq sw ht h f w 1 shu 8 the equality between 5 4 and 5 5 follows from three observations 1 sw w 1 2 p 1 u sw p 1 su w 3 if c p 1 su w then sc cs the first of them is clear to prove the other two we need a lemma lemma 5 2 let s s suppose s p 1 g h and c p 1 h g then sc cs proof for a wall h we denote by h the half space bounded by h that contains 1 h is the other half space bounded by h if sc 6 cs the walls s and c do not intersect consequently one of the following holds s c s c s c s c however s s c 1 s c h s c g s c hence neither inclusion may hold putting g w and h su we deduce observation 3 from lemma 5 2 finally p 1 su w p 1 su w s p s u sw p 1 u sw the first equality follows from 3 the second is clear if we in terpret elements of p 1 su w as walls the third is true because s the only wall separating elements 1 and s does not belong to either side case 2 su u we have 5 6 eswf u es ewf u q 1 ewf u ewf su q 1 h ap 1 u w q 1 hq w ht h f w 1 hu h ap 1 su w q 1 hq w ht h f w 1 hsu which we need to compare with 5 7 k ap 1 u sw q 1 kq sw ht k f w 1 sku we split the sum in 5 7 into two parts over k s and over k 6 s we will show that these parts are equal to the two sums in 5 6 lemma 5 3 in p 1 u sw we have 1 s p 1 u w s proof suppose c 1 s and c 6 s then c p 1 u sw implies c p 1 su w therefore c p 1 u w suppose now that c p 1 u w lemma 5 2 with g w h u implies that cs sc hence c 1 s it follows from this lemma that h 7 k h s is a bijection between ap 1 u w and k ap 1 u sw k s we have k h 1 ht k ht h 1 sk h sw w 1 thus the first sum in 5 6 is equal to the first sub sum of 5 7 notice that p 1 u sw s p s su w p 1 su w s disjoint union if k 6 s then we put h ks p 1 su w we have k h sk hs ht k ht h 1 for 1 h 1 k s s therefore the second sum in 5 6 is equal to the second sub sum of 5 7 6 hecke algebra action in principal series representations in this section we will describe the hecke algebra representation on v k for v in the principal series of g the description is the same for g and for g in this case v l 2 x and v k l 2 x k l 2 w l the last isomorphism given by composition with thus all hecke representations for all q are realized on the same hilbert space l 2 w l this includes the case q 1 when we get the principal series representation of the group algebra of w the dependence on q being important for us we should denote the action of ew on f by q ew f to shorten this we will write w qf instead our goal for the remainder of this section is to express the hecke actions wqf in terms of the weyl actions w 1 f we start with the case w s s the wall s separates w into two pieces s on the side of 1 and s on the side of s the next lemma is somewhat analogous to 5 2 lemma 6 1 9 suppose f l 2 w l then for x w 6 1 sqf x q 1 2 i s 1 f x for x s q 1 f x q 12 i s 1 f x for x s proof we pick some apartment a containing the base chamber c 0 and its s neighbor c 1 let c 2 cq be the other s neighbors of c 0 put f f let y be the unique point in a that is mapped to x by let k s be the stabilizer in g of the common face of c 0 and c 1 under the isomorphism h c k g

appropriate statement is given in theorem 6 2 the argument mimics the proof of proposition 5 1 we consider the sums indexed by the same posets and split them into sub sums in the same way the differences are the summands are slightly different u w has to be replaced by x w one can think of x as of a limit of u as before p a d denotes the set of walls in w separating a from d but now a and d can be sets of points in w or elements of w recall that there is a poset structure on p a d we will perform summations indexed by anti chains in this kind of posets recall that for h ap a d we denote by h also the product of all reflections corresponding to walls in h we put w x dw d x 1 2 i theorem 6 2 let f l 2 w l and let 0 then 6 5 wqf x h ap 1 x w q 1 hq w h 2 hw 1 f x proof we proceed

w h 2 i 2 ht h w h hw 1 f x where ht h was defined in the previous section def 5 1 c we would like to re formulate theorem 6 2 in an x free way recall that for a wall h we have defined h as the set of all w w that are separated from 1 by h for a collection h of pairwise intersecting walls in symbols h 6 we put h h h h we denote by h the set of all x w that are separated from 1 by each h h the characteristic indicator function of a set u will be denoted u we now re state lemma 6 1 and theorem 6 2 corollary 6 3 let f l 2 w l s s w w and let 0 then 6 11 sqf q s 1 f q 1 s f and 6 12 wqf h h 6 w h q 1 hq w h 2 h hw 1 f 11 7 the general setting of right angled hecke algebras and its principal series representations consider now the case where q is not constant but is s dependent the formulae of sections 5 and 6 still hold with special reading first in the formulae where es is involved q is qs these are 5 1 5 2 6 1 and their direct applications second in powers like q 1 h or q w the base q 1 or q is a tuple of numbers qs 1 s s or qs s s the exponent h w or ht h always counts the walls in a certain set the walls have types which are elements of s thus each exponent can be transformed to a multi index for example w is the number of walls separating 1 and w it can be read as s w s s where s w is the number of walls of type s that separate 1 and w then q w is s s q s w s similarly for other powers next we want to suggest another interpretation of 6 we consider the algebra h defined in 5 for a given set of complex parameters qs and interpretation of the formulae as described above one may now read equation 6 1 in lemma 6 1 taking q qs as a definition of a representation of the generators of h as operators on l 2 w it is easy to check by direct calculation that these operators satisfy sq 2 q 1 sq qi one then reads theorem 6 2 and its proof as stating that the above gives a well defined representation of h iii hecke irreducibility our goal in this part is to show that the representation of h on l 2 w described in equation 6 5 is irreducible recall that this will also prove the irreducibility of the representation of g considered in part i our proof is a modification of the proof given in bm the main tool which allows us to use bm almost verbatim is the following pointwise inequality between functions on w w 11 q w 2 wq 1 cw 11 this inequality is established is section 9 in section 10 we explain how to use it to prove hecke irreducibility the hecke algebra representation on l 2 w is given by equation 6 5 as explained in 7 this formula makes sense for all complex values of q not just for positive integers our proof of irreducibility will work for all real qs 1 we assume this is the case from now on for readability purposes we adopt the conventions explained in 7 writing our formulae as if qs was a unique parameter q the notation for this part is as follows by 1 we denote the constant function with value 1 on w but we also use 1 for the unit element of the group w we identify elements of w with points in hd via the orbit map w 7 w 0 hence 1 often stands for the point 0 distance of x and y in hd is denoted x y in particular w w is the hyperbolic distance from w 0 to w 0 we shorten w 1 to w the length parameterized geodesic from a to b will be denoted ba we shorten b 0 to b thus w w 1 w 0 0 the ball of center m and radius r in a metric space m is m m r the closed r neighborhood of a set a will be denoted a r by h we denote a finite set of pairwise intersecting tessellation walls in hd as well as the composition of reflection across these walls the group w is right angled hence the order of composition is not important the intersection of the walls in h is a totally geodesic subspace h the map h is an isometry of hd in fact it is the orthogonal reflection in h 8 individual estimates the goal of this section is to establish estimates for hw 11 z hw z throughout this section we assume that h is a collection of pairwise perpendicular tessellation walls w h and z h recall that hw z exp z 1 hw 2 where d 1 is the dimension of the boundary w cf bm p 52 the busemann function z 1 hw limx z 1 hw 2 x hw the limit being taken over points x hd converging to z definition 8 1 for w h we put 8 1 w h w w hw 2 this quantity will be investigated and the notation explained in the next section the estimate for hw z that we need is as follows 12 proposition 8 2 suppose that h is a collection of pairwise perpendicular tessellation walls assume that w h z h then 8 2 hw z e exp min z w w h exp w 2 this estimate is equivalent to 8 3 z 1 hw w 2 min z w w h 2 which is the limit as x z of the following pair of inequalities proposition 8 3 suppose w x h then a 2 x hw hw 2 x w w b 2 x hw hw 2 w h w 2 our main tool will be lemma 8 4 let h be a collection of pairwise perpendicular hyperplanes in hd suppose that two points a b hd are not separated by any of these hyperplanes then a b a hb proof the geodesic segment a hb intersects every hyperplane of h let the intersection points be p 1 pj numbered from a towards hb and let hi be the hyperplane passing through pi then a p 1 h 1 p 1 p 2 h 1 h 2 p 2 p 3 h pj hb is a piecewise geodesic path from a to b of length a hb proof of prop 8 3 a we apply lemma 8 4 to h and the points x w h to get x w x hw then 8 4 2 x hw hw x x hw x x w 2 x w w proof of prop 8 3 b expanding the gromov product and def 8 1 we see that the required inequality is equivalent to 8 5 x x hw w w hw 2 which we rewrite as 8 6 x 1 w hw w 1 x hw 2 a basic property of quadrangles in hyperbolic spaces bs sec 2 4 1 applied to x w 1 hw yields 8 7 x 1 w hw max x w 1 hw x hw w 1 2 by lemma 8 4 we get x w x hw 1 hw 1 w now 8 6 follows from 8 7 9 hecke action estimate we begin with an explanation of w h and then show the pointwise inequality q w 2 wq 1 cw 11 informally if w h then the geodesic from 1 to w gets close to h at time h 2 and stays near h till time w h w w hw 2 lemma 9 1 w h 0 proof by lemma 8 4 we have 1 hw 1 w using this and the triangle inequality we get 9 1 2 w h 2 w w hw w 1 1 w w hw w 1 1 hw w hw 0 13 lemma 9 2 if x h then x h h 2 if z h then z h h 2 proof by lemma 8 4 we have x x 1 x h hence 2 x h x h x h h the boundary version is obtained by passing to limits proposition 9 3 suppose that w h then w h 2 w h is contained in the closed neighborhood h of h proof since h is convex it suffices to show that w h 2 w w h h by lemma 9 2 w h h 2 this implies that w h 2 h h 2 cf bs def 1 2 2 now h h 2 is the midpoint of 1 h and it belongs to h we can now repeat the argument with the points 1 and w interchanged the point hw plays the role of the point h and the distance from w to h is w hw 2 we get 1 hw w w hw 2 hence 1 w w hw 2 hww w hw 2 now 1 w w hw 2 w w h while hww w hw 2 is the midpoint of w hw and belongs to h corollary 9 4 let w h z h then w min z w w h h 2 proof if the minimum is w h the claim follows directly from prop 9 3 suppose then that z w w h by hyperbolicity bs def 2 1 6 and lemma 9 2 we have 9 2 z w min z h w h h 2 therefore z w h 2 w h and 9 3 w z w w h 2 w h w h 2 w h h h 2 to summaries our discussion we put s h min z w w h we suppress the dependence on z and w since these will be fixed then we put together cor 9 4 and prop 8 2 corollary 9 5 let h be such that w h z h then 9 4 hw z e exp s h exp w 2 furthermore h intersects the closed ball of radius 2 centered at w s h to proceed we need an estimate of the number of h with a given s h proposition 9 6 there exists a constant m depending only on the tessellation such that for any z and w and any closed interval i of length 1 contained in 0 z w the number of h satisfying w h z h s h i is at most m proof for any h as in the statement the set h intersects w i 2 by corollary 9 5 the latter set is contained in hd w max i 1 3 any tessellation chamber intersecting this ball is contained in s hd w max i 1 3 diam p where p is a chamber now all chambers have the same volume and the volume of a ball is finite and depends only on the radius therefore the number of chambers contained in s is uniformly bounded consequently the total number of faces of these chambers is also uniformly bounded and the latter number is not smaller than the number of h s that we are after note that s h always belongs to 0 z w indeed w h 0 by lemma 9 1 while a gromov product is non negative by the triangle inequality proposition 9 7 there exists a constant c depending only on the tessellation and on the parameter q such that for any w w we have a pointwise inequality w 11 q w 2 wq 1 cw 11 14 proof by corollary 6 3 we have 9 5 q w 2 wqf w 1 f d j 1 q 1 q j h h j h 6 w h h hw 1 f in particular for a z w 9 6 q w 2 wq 1 z w 11 z d j 1 q 1 q j h h j h 6 w h z h hw z let q max q 1 q j j 1 d in the calculation below h always satisfies w h z h h 6 we only state explicitly the extra conditions we use cor 9 5 9 7 q w 2 wq 1 z w 11 z q h hw z w 11 z q h e 2 e s h e w 2 w 11 z qe 2 e

and putting c 1 e 2 qm 1 e we obtain the claim in the multi parameter case the index j in formulae 9 5 9 6 and in the definition of q should be read as a multi index with 0 1 components and total degree d 10 the bm argument our goal now is to prove irreducibility of the representation 0 of the hecke algebra h h g k on the space v k the argument follows very closely an irreducibility argument in bm for easier comparison we adjust our notation to match bm thus the boundary w will be denoted b and the measure l will be called we also put h v k l 2 b the base point 0 will be denoted p the characteristic indicator function of a set u is u convergence of operators means weak convergence let be a torsion free finite index subgroup of w for q 1 the hecke representation reduces to a group algebra representation of w this can further be restricted to it is shown in bm that that representation of is irreducible this is achieved by showing that the von neumann algebra generated by the representation operators is the whole end h more precisely for a measurable u b with zero measure boundary the operators 10 1 t u t 1 st u z 11 1 1 15 are shown to converge to 1 u as t we explain the notation z is a short hand for z pp the limit point of the geodesic ray from p through p the set st is a spherical layer of 10 2 st p p t r t r for r diam hd in our setting a completely analogous result is true lemma 10 1 for any u b with zero measure boundary 1 u is a limit point as t of the operators 10 3 qt u t 1 st u z q 1 1 q proof a first we wish to argue that for fixed q and u and varying t the operators qt u t have uniformly bounded norms on l 2 b these operators map non negative functions to non negative functions moreover for every non negative f l 2 b we have qt ut f qt 1 t f so that it is enough to establish a uniform bound for qt 1 t l 2 l 2 this is done by first estimating 10 4 qt 1 t l l qt 1 t 1 l 1 st st q 1 q 1 1 l from the pointwise estimate prop 9 7 we get q 2 q 1 l c 11 l q 2 q 1 1 11 1 hence 10 5 qt 1 t l l c 1 st st 11 11 1 l the latter is uniformly bounded by prop 4 5 of bm the notation there is p 11 next we observe that qt 1 t are self adjoint for a generator s of w we have s q sq as we see from 6 11 hence for w w we get wq w 1 q the set st is invariant under taking inverses because w w 1 consequently the uniform l operator norm bound yields a uniform l 1 operator norm bound finally riesz thorin interpolation gives a uniform l 2 operator norm bound banach alaoglu theorem implies that the family qt u t has a limit point as t let qt u be such a point b we will show that qt u 1 u as in bm for u b and a 0 we denote by u a the e a neighborhood of u in b claim 10 2 cf lemma 5 2 in bm let v b a 0 there is a constant c 0 such that for every satisfying z 6 v a we have 10 6 q 1 v q 1 1 c 0 e a proof for q 1 the claim is a part of lemma 5 2 in bm the general case follows from this special case because q 2 q 1 c 11 q 2 q 1 1 11 1 claim 10 3 cf prop 5 1 in bm assume we are given a family of elements t r with non negative coefficients where t is a real positive parameter suppose that for every t we have t l 1 1 and that for every we have limt t 0 then for every measurable v b and every a 0 10 7 lim sup t t q 1 v q 1 1 lim supt t v a z 16 proof the proof is as in bm p 59 with replaced with q everywhere an outline is as follows the sum on the left hand side is divided into three parts 1 t 0 this part goes to 0 since t 0 pointwise 2 t 0 and z v a this is bounded by the right hand side 3 t 0 and z 6 v a this is negligible by claim 10 2 specializing to t 1 st st u z we get claim 10 4 cf cor 5 3 in bm for measurable u v b that are positive distance apart 10 8 lim t qt ut 1 v 0 an easy consequence is claim 10 5 implicit in bm for measurable u v b that are positive distance apart and a measurable w b 10 9 lim t qt ut w v 0 proof 0 qt ut w v qt u t 1 v 0 specializing claim 10 3 to t 1 st st u z 1 we get claim 10 6 cf cor 5 4 in bm for measurable u v b and every a 0 10 10 lim sup t qt ut v 1 lim sup t 1 st st u z 1 v a z using the last two claims we calculate 10 11 lim sup t qt ut v w lim sup t qt u w a t v w lim sup t qt u w

and equals u w a v a we deduce assuming u w v 0 10 12 lim sup t qt ut v w u w v replacing u or v or w by its complement we get seven similar inequalities adding them up bm deduce for q 1 but the argument is general claim 10 7 cf prop 5 5 in bm for every measurable u v w b with zero measure boundaries 10 13 lim t qt ut v w u w v proof sketched above for other details see bm p 60 as explained further in bm p 60 this equality allows to conclude that qt u 1 u 17 thus the von neumann algebra v n q generated by q contains all operators 1 u assuming u 0 hence it also contains all v u as this is 1 u 1 v again assuming u v 0 now lemma b 3 in bm implies v n q end h hecke irreducibility of h follows by schur s lemma references bm u bader and r muchnik boundary unitary representations
