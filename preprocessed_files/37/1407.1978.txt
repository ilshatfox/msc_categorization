shown that every non periodic ergodic system has two topologically weakly mixing fully supported models one is non minimal but has a dense set of minimal points and the other one is proximal also for indepen dent interests for a given kakutani rokhlin tower with relatively prime column heights it is demonstrated how to get a new taller kakutani rokhlin tower with same property which can be used in weiss s proof of the jewett krieger s theorem and the proofs of our theorems applications of the results are given 1 introduction a measurable system is a quadruple x x t where x x is a lebesgue probability space and t x x is an invertible measure preserving transformation a topological dynamical system is a pair x t where x is a compact metric space and t x x is a homeomorphism let x x t be an ergodic dynamical system we say that x x t is a topological model or just a model for x x t if x t is a topological system is an invariant borel probability measure on x and the systems x x t and x x t are measure theoretically isomorphic the theory of topological models is an important part in dynamical systems and has many applications the well known jewett krieger s theorem asserts that every non periodic ergodic system has a topological model which is strictly ergodic lehrer 9 showed that we can further require the model to be topologically strongly mixing we refer to 2 3 13 15 for surveys and nice results on this topics we note that topological models can also be used to obtain the pointwise convergence of non conventional ergodic averages 6 we mention that the models obtained above are minimal in this paper we study non minimal models for a given ergodic system and obtain their applications here are our main results of this paper note that an ergodic system is non periodic if it has no atom theorem 1 1 1 every non periodic ergodic system has a topological model which is a non minimal topologically weakly mixing system with a full support and a dense set of minimal

mixing system with a full support and a unique fixed point as its only minimal point note that a topological system x t with a unique fixed point as its only minimal point is proximal i e for all x y x infn d t nx t ny 0 hence theorem 1 1 2 means that every non periodic ergodic system has a topological weakly mixing and proximal model with a full support in weiss s new proof of the jewett krieger s theorem 12 15 and weiss theorem on the doubly minimal model 14 a technical complement should be discussed when the column heights of the kakutani rokhlin tower are not relatively prime in this paper we found that one can avoid this and thus simplify the proofs by using a technical lemma i e lemma 3 2 this lemma will be used in the proofs of our theorems and we believe that it will be useful in other settings we find two applications of our results one gives an affirmative answer to a question in 10 by showing that if x t is a topological system and m x tm is the induced system on the probability space then the density of minimal points of m x tm does not implies x t has the same property the other one concerns the existence of a proximal topological k system which was constructed in 5 we obtain a lot of such examples simply using the proximal topological models of any measurable k systems acknowledgments we would like to thank wen huang for very useful sugges tions 2 preliminaries in this section we recall some notions which we will use in the following sections 2 1 a measurable system a measurable system is ergodic if all t invariant sets have measures either 0 or 1 for an ergodic system either the space x consists of a finite set of points on which is equidistributed or the measure is atom less in the first case the system is called periodic and it is called non periodic in the latter a homomorphism from x x t to a system y y s is a measurable map x 0 y 0 where x 0 is a t invariant subset of x and y 0 is an s invariant subset of y both of full measure such that 1 and s x t x for x x 0 when we have such a homomorphism we say that the system y y s is a factor of the system x x t if the factor map x 0 y 0 can be chosen to be bijective and 1 is also measurable then we say that the systems x x t and y y s are measure theoretically isomorphic 2 2 a topological system a topological system x t is transitive if for any non empty open sets u v there is some n z such that u t nv 6 when x has no isolated points x t is transitive if and only if there exists some point x x whose orbit o x t t nx n z is dense in x and we call such a point a transitive point the system is minimal if the orbit of any point is dense in weakly mixing proximal topological models 3 x a point x x is called a minimal point if o x t t is minimal x t is topologically weakly mixing if the product system x x t t is transitive a factor of a topological system x t is another topological system y s such that there exists a continuous and onto map x y satisfying s t in this case x t is called an extension of y s the map is called a factor map 2 3 rokhlin tower we need some basic knowledge related to kakutani rokhlin towers we will use notations from 2 3 15 let x x t be a dynamical system let b x an array c b tb tn 1 b with t jb n 1 j 0 pairwise disjoint is called a rokhlin tower or a column over b of height n the set b is called the base of the tower and tn 1 b is its roof let c n 1 j 0 t jb the carrier of c a collection t of disjoint columns ck with bases bk and heights nk is called a tower and let t k c the union of the bases b k bk is the base of t and the union of the roofs is the roof of t the sets t ix 0 i nk for x bk are called the fibers of t here is the well known rokhlin s lemma theorem 2 1 rokhlin s lemma let x x t be an ergodic system given an 0 and a natural number n there exists a rokhlin tower c of height n with base b x such that c 1 2 4 refining a tower according to a partition let t be a tower with columns ck k k k is finite or countable and base b k k bk given a partition finite or countable we define an equivalence relation on b as follows x y iff x and y are in the same base bk and for every 0 j nk t jx and t jy are in the same elements of i e x and y have the same nk name now we consider each equivalence class bk a with a an nk name as a base of the column ck a bk a tbk a t nk 1 bk a and say that the resulting tower t ck a a nk k k is the tower t refined according to 2 5 kakutani rokhlin tower for an ergodic system x x t let b x with positive measure then it is clear that n 0 t nb x mod define the return time function rb b n by rb x min n 1 t nx b when this minimum is finite and rb x otherwise let bk x b rb x k and note that by poincare s recurrence theorem b is a null set let ck be the column bk tbk t k 1 bk and we call the tower t t b ck k 1 2 the kakutani tower over b if the kakutani tower over b has finitely many columns i e the function rb is bounded we say that b has a finite height and we call the kakutani tower over b a kakutani rokhlin tower or a k r tower the number max rb is called the height of b or the height of k r tower 4 zhengxing lian song shao and xiangdong ye 2 6 symbolic dynamics let s be a finite alphabet with m symbols m 2 we usually suppose that s 0 1 m 1 let sz be the set of all sequences x x 1 x 0 x 1 xi i z xi s i z with the product topology a metric compatible is given by d x y 1 1 k where k min n xn 6 yn x y the shift map is defined by x n xn 1 for all n z the pair is called a shift dynamical system any subsystem of is called a subshift system similarly we can replace z by z 0 1 2 and will be not a homeomorphism but a surjective map each element of s k 1 s k is called a word or a block over s we use a n to denote the length of a if a a 1 an if 1 0 1 and a b z then a b a a 1 b is a b a 1 word occurring in starting at place a and ending at place b similarly we define a a b when a is a word a word a appears in the word b if there are some a b such that b a b a for n n and words a 1 an we denote by a 1 an the concatenation of a 1 an when a 1 an a denote a 1 an by a n if x is a subshift system let i i x x x x 0 i for i s and a a x x x x 0 x 1 x a 1 a for any word a 2 7 partitions let x x t be a measurable system a partition of x is a family of disjoint measurable subsets of x whose union is x let and be two partitions of x x t one says that refines denoted by or if each element of is a union of elements of is equivalent to where a is the algebra generated by the family a let and be two partitions their join is the partition a b a b and extend this definition naturally to a finite number of partitions for m n define nm n i m t i t m t m 1 t n where t i t ia a 2 8 symbolic representation let x x t be an ergodic system and aj 1 j l a finite partition we usually assume aj 0 for all j we sometimes think of the partition as a function 0 x 1 2 l defined by 0 x j for x aj the pair x is traditionally called a process let l 1 2 l z and let s be the shift one can define a homomorphism from x to given by x where n n x 0 t nx we denote the distribution of the stochastic process by x and call it the symbolic representation measure of x let x supp supp then we get a homomorphism x x t x x s this homomor phism is called the symbolic representation of the process x this will not be weakly mixing proximal topological models 5 a model for x x t unless i t i x modulo null sets but in any case this does give a model for a non trivial factor of x 2 9 copying names an important way to produce partitions is by copying or painting names on towers if c t jb n 1 j 0 is a column and a n then copying the name a on the column c means that on c n 1 j 0 t jb we define a partition may not be on the whole space by letting ak t jb aj k k 1 2 l if there is a tower t with q columns ci t jbi ni 1 j 0 and q names a i ni i 1 q then copying these names on t means we copy each name a i on column ci i e we define a partition on t by ak t jbi a i j k i 1 q k these partitions can be extended to a partition a 1 al of the whole space by assigning for example the value 1 to the rest of the space note that we will do this in the sequel 2 10 a metric on partitions for the set of all finite partitions with the same cardinality there is a complete metric definition 2 2 let x x t be a system let a 1 al and b 1 bl be two l set partitions l 2 define d 1 2 l j 1 aj bj note that d will be different when the partitions are indexed in different ways 3 an improvement of a technical lemma in weiss s proof of the jewett krieger theorem in this section we will prove a lemma which is an improvement of a technical lemma in weiss s proof of the jewett krieger s theorem using this lemma one may simplify weiss s arguments in some sense in weiss s new proof of the jewett krieger theorem 12 15 2 and in the proof of weiss theorem on the doubly minimal model 14 one needs the following technical lemma to get a new k r tower from a given one lemma 3 1 2 3 15 let x b t be a non periodic ergodic system and let t c 0 be a k r tower i e max rc 0 then for all n sufficiently large there exists a set c 1 c 0 such that n rc 1 y n 4 max rc 0 y c 1 that is the corresponding k r tower t c 1 satisfies range rc 1 n n 4 max rc 0 6 zhengxing lian song shao and xiangdong ye when one uses this lemma one hopes that the column heights of the k r tower are relatively prime which is not guaranteed in lemma 3 1 hence in weiss s new proof of the jewett krieger s theorem one first assumes that the system has no rational spectrum in which case automatically the column heights of every k r tower are relatively prime then one deals with other cases the following lemma will avoid this kind of discussion lemma 3 2 let x b t be a non periodic ergodic system let t be a k r tower with bases ci and heights hi 1 i k and let n maxi hi and c k i 1 ci assume that h 1 h 2 hk are relatively prime then for any n large enough there is a k r tower t with base d such that 1 d c 2 rd y n n 6 n y d 3 the column heights of t d are relatively prime proof first we will find a set d c with the following two properties i n n r d y n 5 n y d and ii d ci 0 for each 1 i k then according to the second property of d we adjust some part of d to get d such that the column heights of t d are relatively prime step 1 the construction of d now we describe how to get d to that aim we first construct a kakutani tower t b with height larger than 10 n 3 n 2 and b ci 0 for each i but at this point we may have max rb i e t b may not be a k r tower so we need to modify it such that the resulting tower is a k r tower t d by rokhlin lemma there is a b c such that the rokhlin tower c b tb tm 1 b satisfies that m 20 n 3 n 2 and b mini ci 10 k n 3 n 2 k let n 0 0 now find the smallest n 1 n with a 1 n 1 n 0 10 n 3 n 2 b 1 t n 1 b k j 1 cj 10 n 3 n 2 j 0 t jb 0 hence there is some d 1 1 2 k such that t n 1 b cd 1 10 n 3 n 2 j 0 t jb 0 let b 1 t n 1 b cd 1 10 n 3 n 2 j 0 t jb inductively assume that for 1 i k 1 we have obtained n 1 ni distinct numbers d 1 di 1 k and measurable sets b 1 bi let ni 1 be the smallest natural number satisfying ai 1 ni 1 ni 10 n 3 n 2 bi 1 t ni 1 b k j 1 cj i j 1 cdi i s 0 ns 10 n 3 n 2 j ns t jb 0 weakly mixing proximal topological models 7 hence there is some di 1 1 2 k d 1 di such that t ni 1 b cdi 1 i j 1 cdi i s 0 ns 10 n 3 n 2 j ns t jb 0 let bi 1 t ni 1 b cdi 1 i j 1 cdi i s 0 ns 10 n 3 n 2 j ns t jb note that bi 1 t ni 1 b cdi 1 i s 0 ns 10 n 3 n 2 j ns t jb this inductive process can be done for i 2 3 k since b mini ci 10 k n 3 n 2 k which means k 1 i 0 10 n 3 n 2 j 0 t ni jb cs 1 s k now by induction we obtain subsets b 1 bk let b k i 1 bi we claim that the height of each column in the kakutani tower t b is larger than 10 n 3 n 2 i e r b y 10 n 3 n 2 y b to prove the claim we need to prove that for any l 0 and 1 u v k t lbu bv 0 implies l 10 n 3 n 2 since t lbu bv 0 there is a subset p t lbu bv with positive measure if u v then l 10 n 3 n 2 since bu b if u v then l 10 n 3 n 2 since t lp bu b p bv and nu 10 n 3 n 2 j nu t jb bv 0 finally assume u v since nu is the first number satisfing the inductive condition au we have nv 1 j nv 1 10 n 3 n 2 1 t jb bu 0 we also have nv 1 10 n 3 n 2 nv 1 b bu 0 so nv 1 j nv 1 t jb bu 0 since nu nu 1 10 n 3 n 2 and t lp bu t lbv we conclude that l 10 n 3 n 2 by the construction we also see that b ci 0 for each i 1 k since n 3 n and n 3 n 1 are relatively prime we may partition each column of t b into blocks of sizes n 3 n and n 3 n 1 and then we move the base level of each block to the nearest level that belongs to c collect the union of the base level and b and we get a set d c satisfying i the height of t d ranges in n n n 5 n ii d ci 0 for each 1 i k the set of heights of t d may not be relatively prime and we need modify it to what we need step 2 the construction of d for each i 1 k let ei d ci be a measurable subset with positive measure then we get k sets e 1 e 2 ek with the corresponding heights h 1 h 2 h k respectively since t is non periodic and ergodic ei t h iei 0 for each i let 0 mini ei t h iei let f 1 e 1 t h 1 e 1 be a subset satisfying 0 f 1 0 2 k 1 inductively assume for 1 i k 1 we have constructed subsets f 1 fi satisfying 2 fj 8 zhengxing lian song shao and xiangdong ye fj 1 0 2 k j 1 for each 1 j i 1 note that 3 1 i j 1 fj i j 1 0 2 k j 2 0 2 k i 2 1 1 2 i 1 1 2 0 2 k i 1 thus ei 1 t h i 1 ei 1 i j 1 t h jfj 0 1 1 2 k i 1 hence one can find fi 1 ei 1 t h i 1 ei 1 i j 1 t h jfj satisfying 2 fi fi 1 0 2 k i 1 in such a way by induction we get k sets f 1 f 2 fk for each i we have the following properties i fi ci which implies t hifi c ii fi ei t h iei which implies t h ifi d fi iii for j i t h ifi fj and t h ifi fi i 1 s 1 fs iv t h ifi d k j 1 fi 0 note i ii and the first part of iii follow from the definition of fi the second part of iii follows from the inequality fj 1 2 fj i e t h ifi fi 2 fi 1 fi 1 2 fi 2 i 1 s 1 fs and iv is deduced from iii readily finally we put d d k i 1 fi k i 1 t hifi by the properties of fi we conclude 1 d c 2 t d is a k r tower and the height of t d ranges in n n 6 n 3 the collection of the column heights of the k r tower t d contains h i h i hi k i 1 which are relatively prime since hi k i 1 are relatively prime 1 is followed by the definition of d and 2 is from i above by iv and the definition of d for each i 1 k there is some column of t d with height h i hi by 3 1 we have that ei 2 0 2 ki 1 fi which implies that for each i 1 k there is some column of t d with height h i hence we have 3 the tower t d is as required the proof is completed 4 proof of theorem 1 1 1 a subset s of z is syndetic if it has a bounded gaps i e there is n n such that i i 1 i n s 6 for every i z s is thick if it contains arbitrarily long runs of positive integers i e there is a strictly increasing subsequence ni of z such that s i 1 ni ni 1 ni i some dynamical properties can be interrupted by using the notions of syndetic or thick subsets for example a classic result of gottschalk and hedlund 4 stated that x is a minimal point if and only if n x u n z t nx u weakly mixing proximal topological models 9 is syndetic for any neighborhood u of x and by furstenberg 1 a topological system x t is weakly mixing if and only if n u v n z u t nv 6 is thick for any non empty open subsets u v of x a set s is called thickly syndetic if for every n the positions where length n runs begin form a syndetic set a subset s of z is piecewise syndetic if it is an intersection of a syndetic set with a thick set it is known that a topological system x t is an m system i e the set of minimal point of x t is dense if and only if there is a transitive point x such that n x u is piecewise syndetic for any neighborhood u of x see for example 7 lemma 2 1 we will use this fact in the sequel to prove theorem 1 1 1 we begin with the following observation lemma 4 1 let x x t be a non periodic ergodic system then there is a tower whose set of the column heights is infinite proof given a tower with base c 1 if the set of column heights is infinite then we are done or we put it to be h 1 hn 1 let c i 1 be the corresponding column base with the height hi and we may assume that h 1 hn 1 by putting the column bases with the same height together to form a new column base choose a measurable set e 1 t hn 1 cn 11 such that 0 e 1 1 2 min 1 i n 1 c i 1 let c 2 c 1 e 1 and we have a tower with base c 2 if the set of the column heights is infinite then we are done or we have a bigger height set than the tower with base c 1 and let it be h 1 hn 1 hn 1 1 hn 2 let c i 2 be the corresponding column base with the height hi and we assume that h 1 hn 1 hn 2 choose a measurable set e 2 t hn 2 cn 22 such that 0 e 2 1 22 min 1 i n 2 c i 2 let c 3 c 2 e 2 and continue the process above if after finite steps we get a tower with infinitely many heights then we are done or we will have a sequence of towers with deceasing bases ck n 1 nk and measurable sets ej with 0 ej 1 2 j min 1 i nj c i j for 1 j k such that ck 1 ck ek 1 1 2 k ck for all k n let c k 1 ck then c 0 and the tower with base c has infinitely many heights the proof is completed we follow the standard procedure to prove theorem 1 1 1 namely first for a given partition we construct a partition close to such that the corresponding symbolic representation x x s is a non minimal topologically weakly mixing system with a dense set of minimal points then we use the inverse limit by a more delicate argument finally we show the resulting system is the one which we need 10 zhengxing lian song shao and xiangdong ye proposition 4 2 let x x t be a non periodic ergodic system and let be a fi nite partition of x for each 0 there is a partition such that the corresponding symbolic representation x x s is a non minimal topologically weakly mixing system with a dense set of minimal points and d proof by lemma 4 1 there is a tower consisting of infinitely many columns with different heights precisely let t c be a tower as in lemma 4 1 with columns ck k n and base c k nck let hk be the height of column ck and assume that h 1 h 2 note that for k large enough ck will be very small we will adjust some ck to get what we need let 0 a 1 a k for each m n let m v 1 v 2 vkm where v a 1 k m 1 a 2 k m 2 am a 1 a 2 am for each a 1 am 1 2 k m that is each vi is a word of length m and m is a word which contains all the m name in 1 2 k m note that m mk m before going on let us recall the notion of copying a name on the column let c t jb h 1 j 0 be a column and a 1 k n with n h then copying the name a on the column c means that we copy the name a on the first n levels of c that means for the new partition a 1 ak one has that t i 1 b aai 1 i n where a a 1 an 1 k n step 1 since k ck there are columns cn 11 cn 21 such that cn 11 cn 21 2 and hn 21 hn 11 2 k 2 let 111 11 h n 1 1 k 1 k h n 1 1 where 1 j 1 1 1 with the length j and let 121 21 h n 2 1 k 1 k h n 2 1 for i 1 2 copy the name 1 i 1 to the column cni 1 and we get a partition 1 note that d 0 1 d 1 2 the first step of adjustment is finished step m in general for each m n choose columns cn 1 m cnm 1 m such that m 1 i 1 cnim 2 m and assume that h n m 1 m hn 1 m 2 m 2 k 2 m for 1 i m let nim 2 i 1 2 i 1 2 i 1 m times 1 h nim m 2 i 1 k 2 i 1 2 i 1 i 1 h nim m 2 i 1 k 2 i 1 1 k h nim and let nm 1 m 2 m 1 h n m 1 m 2 mk 2 m 1 k h n m 1 m now for 1 i m 1 copy the name nim to the column cnim and we get a new partition m note that d m 1 m 2 m moreover note that we do copying on the m columns cn 1 m cnmm to make sure that the symbolic representation of the resulting partition is not minima but has a dense set of minimal points and we do copying on c n m 1 m to make sure the symbolic weakly mixing proximal topological models 11 representation of the resulting partition is weakly mixing of course we can do it on a single column but this will cause complication when dealing with the situation in proposition 4 4 for all m n we make the above adjustment and we obtain a new partition a 1 ak it is clear that d i 1 d i 1 i i 1 2 i properties of now we prove that x x s is non minimal weakly mixing and the set of minimal points is dense to show x s is weakly mixing it suffices to show that for each m n e 1 f 1 e 2 f 2 m 1 i 0 t i with positive measures the following holds e 1 f 1 t t me 2 f 2 0 this depends on the adjustment on c n m 1 m denote 2 m by 2 m u 1 u 2 uk 2 m where uj k 2 m j 1 1 2 k 2 m let the names of e 1 e 2 f 1 and f 2 be e 1 e 2 f 1 f 2 1 k m respectively then e 1 e 2 us and f 1 f 2 ut for some 1 t s k 2 m by the construction of it follows that t 2 m s 1 c n m 1 m e 1 t me 2 and t 2 m t 1 c n m 1 m f 1 t mf 2 thus e 1 f 1 t t m e 2 f 2 t 2 m s 1 c n m 1 m t 2 m t 1 c n m 1 m in particular we conclude that e 1 f 1 t t m e 2 f 2 t 2 m s 1 cnm 1 m t 2 m t 1 cnm 1 m 0 to see x s is a non minimal m system we show that each transitive point w x is piecewise syndetically but not syndetically recurrent let x x such that x w it is easy to see that w 6 1 let w a 2 a 1 a 0 a 1 a 2 then for each m n w m 1 m 1 p x p m 1 m 1 a m 1 a 0 a 1 am 1 is a neighborhood of w let a m 1 i m 1 t i with the name a m 1 am 1 since w 6 1 it is clear that when m large enough we have a m 1 am 1 6 12 m 1 as defined before 2 m 1 v 1 v 2 vk 2 m 1 where vi k 2 m 1 i 1 1 k 2 m 1 then a m 1 am 1 vr for some r for each j m by the definition of x one can find lj such that t ljx cnm j by the construction of for 1 i j t i 2 m 1 k 2 m 1 2 m 1 r 1 mcnm j a that means for each j m lj i 2 m 1 k 2 m 1 2 m 1 r 1 m 1 i j n w w m 1 m 1 which implies n w w m 1 m 1 is piecewise syndetic on the other hand for each j m and m 1 i hnm j j 2 m 1 k 2 m 1 t lj j 2 m 1 k 2 m 1 ix m 1 d m 1 t da 1 as a m 1 am 1 6 1 m we have that 12 zhengxing lian song shao and xiangdong ye m 1 d 0 t da 1 a and hence t lj j 2 m 1 k 2 m 1 ix 6 a which implies for each j m lj j 2 m 1 k 2 m 1 i m 1 i hnm j j 2 m 1 k 2 m 1 n w w m 1 m 1 since hnm j j 2 m 1 k 2 m 1 2 j 2 k 2 j j 2 m 1 k 2 m 1 and 2 j 2 k 2 j j 2 m 1 k 2 m 1 j we conclude that n w w m 1 m 1 is not syndetic the proof is completed to prove theorem 1 1 1 proposition 4 2 is not enough in fact we need to get an increasing sequence of required partitions n such that the inverse limit of the corresponding symbolic representations is what we need the following simple fact will used lemma 4 3 let a 1 aa a 1 a a and b 1 bb be partitions with then there is a natural way to get a partition such that moreover if d then we also have d to see it we note that defines a function 1 b 2 1 a such that ax by iff x y let b 1 b b b s t s a t notice that if d then we also have d since it is easy to check that a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 a 1 a 2 b 1 b 2 proposition 4 4 let x x t be a non periodic ergodic system then there exists an increasing sequence of finite partitions n such that n x and for each n n the corresponding symbolic representation x n x n n s is a non minimal topologically weakly mixing system with a dense set of minimal points proof the basic idea of the proof is the same as in the proof of of proposition 4 2 since we have to deal with countably many partitions we need to do some small modifications with the proof let n be an increasing sequence of finite partitions such that n x first we fix the same tower t c as in the proof of proposition 4 2 and let n be a sequence with n 1 n for 1 we adjust 1 as in step 1 of the proof of proposition 4 2 to get a new partition 11 we replace 2 by 2 11 and thus we have 1 1 2 then continue our induction to be precise we rewrite the step m step m we replace m by m m 1 m 1 still denote it by m and thus we have m 1 m 1 m let j b j 1 b j 2 b j kj for 1 j m since 1 m we may assume that b j i b j 1 i for each 2 j m 1 i kj 1 weakly mixing proximal topological models 13 recall that the word m depends on the cardinality of the partition in the proof of proposition 4 2 unlike the situation there now the cardinalities of partitions are increasing let m m k as in the proof of proposition 4 2 and denote m j m kj for 1 j m that is m j is a word which contains all the m name in 1 2 kj m for each m n choose columns cn 1 m cnm m 1 m such that m m 1 i 1 cnim m the columns should be disjoint from the columns in step k k m we assume that for each 1 j m h n j m 1 m h n j 1 m 1 1 m 2 m 2 k 2 mj for each 1 j m 1 i m s m 1 j 1 i let nsm 2 i 1 j 2 i 1 j 2 i 1 j m j times 1 hnsm m j 2 i 1 k 2 i 1 j 2 i 1 j m j 1 hnsm m j 2 i 1 k 2 i 1 j 1 kj hnsm and let n j m 1 m 2 m j 1 h n j m 1 m 2 mk 2 m j 1 kj h n j m 1 m now for 1 i m m 1 copy the name nim to the column cnim and we obtain a new partition mm with d m m m m inductively we could construct a sequence of partitions nn n with the property that d m m m m for each m n now we need to build the required partition n from n n n first we construct partitions n k n n 1 k n via n n n then k limn n k is what we are looking for 11 21 2 2 31 3 2 3 3 1 2 3 applying lemma 4 3 to 2 2 2 and 1 1 we obtain 2 1 similarly applying lemma 4 3 to 3 3 3 and 2 2 we obtain 3 2 and we get 3 1 by applying lemma 4 3 to 3 3 3 and 21 inductively we construct n k for k n by applying lemma 4 3 and n n 1 k for k n since 1 2 n we have n 1 n 2 n n accordingly since d nn n n and n n 1 n 1 we know that for each 1 k n 1 we have d nk n 1 k n that means for each k n k n k is a cauchy sequence so there is a partition k such that n k k as n let x n k denote the corresponding symbolic system of nk the array shows the induction 14 zhengxing lian song shao and xiangdong ye x 11 x 21 x 2 2 x 31 x 3 2 x 3 3 by the construction for each k the sequence nk n k has the same property as n in proposition 4 2 according to the proof of proposition 4 2 the corresponding symbolic system xk x k of k is non minimal topologically weakly mixing with a dense set of minimal points since for each n n n 1 n 2 n n we conclude that k k is increasing as k x and d k k s k s we deduce k x too now theorem 1 1 1 follows from proposition 4 4 and the following lemma lemma 4 5 let x t be the inverse limit of xn tn n where each xn tn is a non minimal topologically weakly mixing system with a dense set of minimal points then x t is also a non minimal topologically weakly mixing system with a dense set of minimal points proof by the definition of the inverse limit it is easy to see that x t is not minimal as the factor of a minimal system is minimal to show the density of minimal points in x assume u is a nonempty open set let n x xn be the projection then by the topology of x there are n n and an open non empty set un xn such that 1 n un u let xn un be a minimal point and a be its orbit closure then there is a minimal set b of x such that n b a this implies that there is a minimal point x of x such that n x xn which implies that x 1 n xn 1 n un u and hence the set of minimal point of x is dense the similar argument can be applied to show that x t is weakly mixing the proof of is completed 5 proof of theorem 1 1 2 in this section we will prove theorem 1 1 2 first we will construct a model which is weakly mixing with a full support but its set of minimal points is not dense since in this case the closure of the set of minimal points has measure zero we collapse it to a point and get the system required first we need the following lemma see 2 3 15 for a proof lemma 5 1 let x be a non periodic ergodic system for any positive integers n 1 n 2 with n 1 n 2 1 there exists a set c of finite height such that the k r tower t c satisfies range rc n 1 n 2 to show theorem 1 1 2 we start with the following proposition and then follow the standard procedure to finish the proof to control the thickly syndetic sets the construction here is more involved than that in proposition 4 2 weakly mixing proximal topological models 15 proposition 5 2 let x x t be a non periodic ergodic system and a finite partition of x then for each 0 there is a partition such that the correspond ing symbolic representation x x s is a weakly mixing system whose set of minimal points is not dense and d proof the proof will be conducted by an inductive procedure we first choose a sequence of positive real numbers n n 0 with n 0 n then we start from 1 and construct n so that d n n 1 n 1 for n 1 it is easy to see that the limiting partition satisfies d to do so let a 1 a 2 ak on one hand is constructed so that x t is topologically weakly mixing on the other hand almost every point will enter a 2 thickly syndetically so that the set of minimal points is not dense now we begin our construction step 0 let a 1 a k let 0 be the name containing all pairs of names of non trivial elements in 1 i 0 t i where non trivial elements in this proof means the elements with positive measures let m 0 min b b 1 i 0 t i and 0 0 min 3 m 0 3 choose l 0 n such that l 0 max 6 0 2 k 2 now for a fixed n 0 max 6 l 0 0 6 m 0 by lemma 5 1 there is a tower t c 0 c 1 0 c 2 0 such that heights of columns c 1 0 c 2 0 are n 0 n 0 1 respectively and the corresponding bases are c 10 c 2 0 it is clear c 0 c 1 0 c 2 0 put e 0 c 0 copy the name 0 on the partial column t ic 0 0 i 0 1 then in column c 10 copy 2 to the position il 0 for all 0 i n 0 1 l 0 and in column c 20 copy 2 to the position il 0 for all 0 i n 0 l 0 in such a way we have constructed a new partition 0 a 0 1 a 0 2 a 0 k note that d 0 0 3 since the measure changed is less than 2 k 2 n 0 l 0 c 0 2 k 2 n 0 l 0 1 n 0 0 6 0 6 0 3 let a 0 i 1 a 0 i 2 a 0 i 3 a 0 i 4 0 assume that positions of 2 name i 1 i 3 i 2 i 4 ap pearing in 0 are s and t then t sc 0 a 1 i 1 t s 1 c 0 a 1 i 3 t rc 0 a 0 i 2 and t r 1 c 0 a 0 i 4 hence t sc 0 t rc 0 a 0 i 1 t 1 a 0 i 3 a 0 i 2 t 1 a 0 i 4 a 0 i 1 a 0 i 2 t t 1 a 0 i 3 a 0 i 4 in particular a 0 i 1 a 0 i 2 t t 1 a 0 i 3 a 0 i 4 c 0 2 e 20 0 now assume that inductively we have constructed partitions i n i 0 two se quences of positive integers li 0 i n si 0 i n two sequences of positive numbers i 0 i n ei 0 i n with i 1 min i 3 e 2 i 3 also assume that we have obtained a sequence of k r towers with relatively prime heights t c j i 1 i j n such that c 0 c 1 1 c n n and the height of t c n i ranges in ni ni 6 ni 1 with some positive integers nj 1 j n let i a i 1 a i 2 a i k for 1 i n the sequence i n i 1 satisfies the following properties for each i n 16 zhengxing lian song shao and xiangdong ye 1 i we have d i 1 i i let i j 0 t j i 1 u 1 u with uj being nontrivial then there is a subset b 1 b i j 0 t j i such that the i 1 name of uh and the i name of bh are the same for each 1 h moreover for all e 1 f 1 e 2 f 2 u 1 u one has that t t si e 1 f 1 e 2 f 2 e 2 i 0 in particular for all e 1 f 1 e 2 f 2 i 1 j 0 t j i 1 one has that t t si e 1 f 1 e 2 f 2 e 2 i 0 2 i c i i c i i 1 c i 1 and for j i 1 t c i 1 j t c i j refine the towers t c i j according to i for each 1 j i for each 1 j i if a column c with base c in the resulting tower t c i j has the i name a 1 a 2 ah h then the name satisfies 5 1 aslj t 2 for each 0 t j 1 s h j 2 lj i e t slj tc ai 2 t c 1 1 t c 2 1 t c 3 1 t c 1 t c 2 2 t c 3 2 t c 2 t c 3 3 t c 3 note that 1 i will be used to show that x is weakly mixing and 2 i will be used to show that the minimal points are not dense in x step n 1 now we make the induction for the n 1 case first we need to define a word n 1 which contains all pairs of names of non trivial elements in n 1 i 0 t i n we do it as follows refine the tower t c n n according to n and let the resulting tower be t c n n cjn j note that the height of each column is in nn nn 6 nn 1 let wn 2 b 1 b 2 bt 1 k n 2 be the set of all names of nontrivial elements of n 1 i 0 t i n each n 2 word bj j 1 t in wn 2 either appears in some column c ij n of t c n n or appears in the concatenation of two columns of t c n n i e there are ca cb in t c n n such that the name appears in cacb in the second case we also use c ij n to denote the concatenation of two columns let b j be the name of c ij n now fix a large number sn 1 10 n 2 n and construct the word n 1 as follows for each pair j 1 j 2 1 t 2 make sure that words c ij 1 n and c ij 2 n appear in n 1 and the distance from the word bj 1 to the word bj 2 is sn 1 since the column heights of t c n n are relatively prime and sn 1 is large enough one can use n names of columns cin i to fill gaps between each pair b i b j weakly mixing proximal topological models 17 let mn 1 1 2 minb n 2 i 0 t i n b n 1 min n 3 e 2 n 3 then let ln 1 max n 1 10 n 2 n 3 nn 6 n n 1 and nn 1 max 6 n 1 ln 1 n 1 n 3 mn 1 by proposi tion 3 2 we have a new k r tower t c n 1 n 1 with relatively prime column heights and c n 1 n 1 c n n and its height ranges in nn 1 nn 1 6 nn refine t c n 1 n 1 according to n and let the resulting tower be c j n 1 j let the base of c j n 1 be c j n 1 and let its height be hj let en 1 mini c i n 1 now we do the following adjustment for each column c j n 1 denote the name c j n 1 by c 1 c 2 chj hj first copy the name n 1 to ch c n 1 h 1 where h n 3 is the first number such that t h 1 c j n 1 c n n secondly we choose a r n such that ln 1 2 nn r ln 1 r n 1 h 1 10 n 2 n and t r 1 c j n 1 c n n since the column heights of the tower t c n n are relatively prime we can replace c n 1 1 cr 1 by the names encountered in the tower t c n n finally copy 2 to csln 1 r for each 0 r n 1 1 s h n 2 ln 1 then according to the new name we have a new partition n 1 properties of n 1 note that by the construction of n 1 if we refine the tower t c n 1 n 1 according to n 1 then the resulting tower will still be c j n 1 j since column heights of the tower t c n n are relatively prime we have made sure that the first ln 1 length part of the name along the column in c j n 1 j consists only of the name encountered in the tower t c n n these change the levels where the bases of the t c n n name blocks occur thus it defines a new base which we called c n 1 n and therefore a new k r tower t c n 1 n since d n n 1 n 1 changes from the tower t c n n to t c n 1 n are very small less than n 1 since we copy 2 to csln 1 r for each 0 r n 1 1 s h n 2 ln 1 each n 1 name of t c n 1 n either has the same name with some column in t c n n or has more 2 appeared than some column name in t c n n anyway for each name with the length h in t c n 1 n in the positions sln t 0 t j 1 s h n 2 ln the names are 2 by 2 n c n n c n n 1 c n 1 above changes from the tower t c n n to the tower t c n 1 n will induce corresponding changes such that the tower t c n j will become some new tower t c n 1 j for each 1 j n 1 where c n 1 n 1 c n 1 n c n 1 1 by the same reason as showed for t c n 1 n equality 5 1 holds for each j n 1 thus we have 2 n 1 now we verify that n 1 satisfies 1 n 1 18 zhengxing lian song shao and xiangdong ye by the construction the measure changed from n to n 1 is less than cn 1 n 1 n 2 nn 1 6 nn ln 1 1 nn 1 ln 1 n 2 2 nn 1 ln 1 1 6 n 1 n 1 2 n 1 ln 1 n 1 2 n 1 2 n 1 thus we conclude that d n n 1 n 1 and the second part of 1 n 1 is guar anteed by the construction of n 1 let di 1 di 2 dj 1 dj 2 n 1 i 0 t i n and let their names be bi 1 bi 2 bj 1 bj 2 wn 2 respectively where 1 i 1 i 2 j 1 j 2 t then by the definition of n 1 pairs bi 1 bj 1 and bi 2 bj 2 appear in the word n 1 given arbitrary column c i n 1 with the base c in 1 let p be the position of bi 1 in this column and let r be the distance from the position of bi 1 to the position of bi 2 then we have t p 1 c in 1 di 1 t p 1 sn 1 c in 1 dj 1 t p 1 rc in 1 di 2 t p 1 r sn 1 c in 1 dj 2 it follows that t p 1 c in 1 t p 1 rc in 1 di 1 t sn 1 dj 1 di 2 t sn 1 dj 2 di 1 di 2 t t sn 1 dj 1 dj 2 hence di 1 di 2 t t sn 1 dj 1 dj 2 t p 1 c in 1 t p 1 rc in 1 e 2 n 1 0 thus 1 n 1 holds properties of so by the induction we have a sequence of partitions n and assume that limit partition is a 1 a 2 ak it is clear d i 0 i also by the condition 2 n for n 1 each sequence t c j n j n has a limit tower t c n with base c n and by 2 n c 1 c 2 now we show is the partition required first we claim that satisfies the following properties 1 for each m 0 e 1 f 1 e 2 f 2 m 1 j 0 t j we have that t t sm e 1 f 1 e 2 f 2 0 2 refine the towers t c j according to for each j 1 if column c in the resulting tower t c j has the name a 1 a 2 ah h and let its base be c then the name satisfies 5 2 aslj t 2 for each 0 t j 1 s h j 2 lj i e t slj tc a 2 weakly mixing proximal topological models 19 condition 2 is guaranteed by 2 n it is left to verify the condition 1 by condition 1 m there are e 1 f 1 e 2 f 2 m 1 j 0 t j m 1 such that they have the same names with e 1 f 1 e 2 f 2 respectively by 1 m t t sm e 1 f 1 e 2 f 2 e 2 m then by d m j m 1 j one has that t t sm e 1 f 1 e 2 f 2 e 2 m j m 1 j 0 now using conditions 1 and 2 we will show is what we need let x be the corresponding symbolic representation of and x x be the factor map let i 0 w x w 0 i for i 1 2 k let w x 1 0 be a transitive point of x t by property 1 x t is weakly mixing by property 2 n w 2 0 is thickly syndetic which implies that n w 1 0 is not piecewise syndetic hence the set of minimal points of x t is not dense similar to lemma 4 5 we have the following easy observation lemma 5 3 let x t be the inverse limit of xn tn n where each xn tn is a non minimal topologically weakly mixing system whose set of minimal points is not dense then x t is also a non minimal topologically weakly mixing system whose set of minimal points is not dense using the similar argument that we obtain proposition 4 4 from proposition 4 2 and adjusting the proof of proposition 5 2 we deduce the following result proposition 5 4 every non periodic ergodic system has a topological model which is a weakly mixing system with a full support and the set of minimal points is not dense proof the idea of the proof is similar to the one used in the proof of proposition 4 4 we will show that there exists an increasing sequence of finite partitions n such that n x and for each n n the corresponding symbolic representation x n x n n s is a weakly mixing system with a full support and the set of minimal points is not dense then by lemma 5 3 we finish the proof let x x t be the ergodic system let n n 0 be an increasing sequence of finite partitions such that n x and let n be a sequence of positive numbers with n 0 n we will modify the proof of proposition 5 2 carefully to get what we need as in the proof of proposition 5 2 we choose a tower t c 00 and adjust 0 by step 0 to get a new partition 00 we replace 1 by 1 00 still denote it by 1 and it is clear 00 1 we assume that the first element resp second element of 1 is a subset of the first element resp the second element of 0 0 as in step 1 of the proof of proposition 5 2 we modify 1 to deduce a new partition 11 we then construct a tower t c 1 1 using lemma 3 2 and form a new tower t c 10 20 zhengxing lian song shao and xiangdong ye by fact in the proof of proposition 4 4 we construct 10 1 1 refining 1 0 to t c 10 we know that 1 0 satisfying 1 1 2 1 in step 1 of the proof of proposition 5 2 since 1 0 0 inductively we replace n by n n 1 n 1 and we assume that the first element resp second element of n is a subset of the first element resp second element of n 1 n 1 we modify n by step n to get a new partition n n such that d n n n n and by the same argument we know that nn satisfies the same properties listed in 1 n and 2 n for the tower t c n n now construct n k n n by lemma 4 3 since the first and second elements of n are subsets of the first and second elements of n 1 n 1 respectively and n n 1 n 1 we conclude that n k satisfies the same properties listed in 1 n and 2 n for the tower t c n j k j n by the proof of proposition 5 2 the partition k limn n k satisfies properties as 1 2 there hence according to the proof of proposition 5 2 x k is a weakly mixing system with a full support and the set of minimal points is not dense following the same discussion as in the proof of proposition 4 4 we know that k is increasing and k x the proof is completed now using proposition 5 4 we are able to finish the proof of theorem 1 1 2 proof of theorem 1 1 2 for a given ergodic system x x t by proposition 5 4 there is a topological model y s of x with an ergodic measure which is weakly mixing non minimal and the set of minimal point min y is not dense in supp y note that min y 0 since min y is an s invariant set define an equivalence relation in y as follows x y if x y min y then the quotient system x y t is a system that is measure theoretically isomorphism to y s since min y 0 hence x t is also a topological model of x x t note that x t is a topologically weakly mixing system with a full support and a unique fixed point as its only minimal point thus the proof is completed 6 applications in this section we give two applications of the results we obtained let x t be a topological dynamics and m x is the collection of all borel probability measures on x with the weak topology then t induces a map tm on m x naturally by sending m x to t an unsolved question in 10 is that if there is a weakly mixing proximal system x t such that m x tm has dense minimal points we give an affirmative answer to this question that is theorem 6 1 there is a weakly mixing proximal system x t such that m x tm has dense minimal points to show this result we need a lemma from 10 lemma 6 2 let x y be two compact metric spaces m x and m y weakly mixing proximal topological models 21 1 if a n i 1 ai where a 1 an are borel subsets of x with ai 0 and ai aj 0 for all 1 i j n then a n i 1 ai a ai 2 let 0 and a be a borel subset of x with a 0 if b is a borel subset of x such that b 0 and a b a then d a b 2 3 if x y is measurable and then 1 a a for each borel subset a of y proof of theorem 6 1 let 2 t be the dyadic adding machine with a unique ergodic measure by theorem 1 1 2 t is isomorphic to y s where y s is a weakly mixing proximal topological system and has full support we now show that the set of periodic points of m y sm is dense let 2 t y s be an isomorphism that is there are invariant borel subsets x 1 x and x 2 y with x 1 x 2 1 and an invertible measure preserving transformation x 1 x 2 such that tx s x for all x x 1 let 0 and let u be a non empty open subset of y since has full support we have u 0 thus there are finitely many pairwise disjoint cylinders a 1 ak of x such that 1 u a u with a k i 1 ai which implies u a x 1 u using lemma 6 2 2 d u a x 1 2 since t 2 c c c for each cylinder c of x where c stand for the length of c we conclude that c is periodic in particular each ai is periodic by lemma 6 2 3 each ai x 1 is also periodic by lemma 6 2 1 a x 1 k i 1 pi ai x 1 where pi ai a thus a x 1 is periodic it follows that u is approached by periodic points of m y sm now take y y and let un n 1 be a sequence of open neighborhoods of y such that diam un 0 for any f c y r we have y f z d un f y un f z f y d un 0 a simple calculation shows un y and hence y is a limit point of p sm this implies that each element of mn y 1 n n i 1 xi xi x is approached by elements of p sm since n 1 mn y is dense inm y it follows that m y sm is a p system this ends the proof another application of our result is the following a topological analogy of k systems called topological k system was studied in 8 in 5 the authors constructed a proximal topological k system which is weakly mixing using theorem 1 1 we can get a lot of such examples which are strongly mixing theorem 6 3 there exist strongly mixing proximal topological k systems proof let x t be a measurable k system by theorem 1 1 x t is iso morphic to a proximal system y s with a measure of full support thus y s is strongly mixing since a k system is strongly mixing in the measurable sense at the same time we know that y s is topological k by 8 theorem 3 4 22 zhengxing lian song shao and xiangdong ye references 1 h furstenberg
