state from the rotational curves of galaxies z rezaei physics department and biruni observatory college of sciences shiraz university shiraz 71454 iran abstract in this work we employ the dark matter equations of state dmeoss obtained from the rotational curves of galaxies as well as the fermionic dmeos with m 1 0 gev to study the structure of dark matter admixed neutron stars dmanss applying the equation of state in the skyrme framework for the neutron matter nm we calculate the mass radius relation for different dmanss with various dmeoss and central pressure of dark matter dm to nm ratios our results show that for some dmeoss the mass radius relations are in agreement with new observations e g exo 1745 248 4 u 1608 52 and 4 u 1820 30 which are inconsistent with the normal neutron stars we conclude that both dmeoss and central pressure ratios of dm to nm affect the slope of the mass radius relation of dmanss this is because of the interaction between dm and nm which leads to gravitationally or self bound dmanss we study the radius of the nm sphere as well as the radius of the dm halo for different dmanss the results confirm that in some cases a nm sphere with a small radius is surrounded by a halo of dm with a larger radius our calculations verify that due to the different degrees of dm domination in dmanss with a value of the visible radius of a star two possible dmanss with different masses can be exist the gravitational redshift is also calculated for dmanss with different dmeoss and central pressure ratios the results explain that the existence of dm in a dmans leads to higher values of gravitational redshift of the star keywords stars neutron dark matter galaxies halos galaxies kinematics and dynamics equation of state 1 introduction a neutron star is a compact star which contains many neutrons the theory of general relativity predicts the existence of a maximum mass above which the neutron star is unstable and collapses into a quark star or black hole the maximum mass of a neutron star depends on the interaction between particles and thus the equation of state eos of the system the stiffer the eos the larger the maximum mass of neutron star in addition the rotation of the neutron star leads to higher values of the maximum mass since the neutron star contains dense asymmetric nuclear matter one should apply the eos of strongly interacting asymmetric nuclear matter to investigate the bulk properties of the star in addition some authors have studied the effects of the existence of other particles such as hyperons meson condensates and quarks in the core of neutron stars on the maximum mass ozel 2006 alford et al 2007 li et al 2010 from observation radio pulsars show large masses of about 2 m ozel 2006 demorest et al 2010 antoniadis et al 2013 for example according to ozel 2006 the mass of neutron star exo 07482676 is measured to be 2 10 0 28 m and the radius equal to 13 8 1 8 km from theory stiff eoss like the neutron matter nm eos in sly 230 a and sly 230 b models chabanat et al 1997 can result in such large masses and mass radius relations never theless in some observations such as exo 1745 248 with mass m 1 4 0 1 m and radius r 11 1 km ozel guver psaltis 2009 the neutron star in 4 u 1608 52 with mass m 1 74 0 14 m and radius r 9 3 1 0 km guver et al 2010 a and also the neutron star in the low mass x ray binary 4 u 1820 30 with mass m 1 58 0 06 m and radius r 9 1 0 4 km guver et al 2010 b the results are different it can be shown that soft eoss are needed to lead these mass radius relations from observation different equations of state for pure nuclear matter that have been obtained using different methods such as the variational method with http arxiv org abs 1612 02804 v 2 2 av 18 potential plus the uix potential or av 18 potential plus a three body uix potential akmal pandharipande 1997 and dirac brueckner hartree fock models prakash et al 1988 engvik et al 1994 cannot predict some ob servational data such as 4 u 1608 52 and 4 u 1820 30 lattimer prakash 2001 2007 therefore this rules out the possibility of the existence of the pure nuclear matter in the neutron star one explanation for these observations is that the existence of some particles such as quarks mesons and hyperons in the neutron star can lead to soft eoss and the mass radius relations in agreement with these observations weber 2005 page reddy 2006 alford et al 2007 klahn et al 2007 in addition another possibility that leads to these mass radius relations is the existence of dark matter dm in the neutron star cosmological structure springel et al 2005 gravitational lensing massey et al 2007 and galactic rotational curve weber de boer 2010 are some observations that could confirm the existence of dm according to ade et al 2014 the contributions of ordinary matter dm and dark energy in the universe are 4 9 26 8 and 68 3 respectively supposing the existence of dm it should be present in all astrophysical objects sandin ciarcelluti 2009 the dm may be accreted to the neutron stars because of the large density of the neutron star matter bertone fairbairn 2008 perez garcia silk 2012 fuller ott 2015 therefore to study models of dm neutron stars are of much interest in astrophysics and astroparticle physics goldman nussinov 1989 bertone fairbairn 2008 kouvaris 2012 it has been shown that self annihilating neutralino wimp dm accreted onto neutron stars may lead to seeding compact objects with long lived lumps of strange quark matter perez garcia silk stone 2010 the heating caused by possible dm annihilation in neutron stars may be an observable lavallaz fairbairn 2010 since the neutron star itself does not burn in addition it has been indicated that self annihilation of dm in neutron stars can change their linear and angular momentum perez garcia silk 2012 as well as the cooling properties of neutron stars kouvaris 2008 the critical phases of stellar evolution could be modified in the presence of relatively small amounts of dm sandin ciarcelluti 2009 because of the possibility of the existence of dm in neutron stars a model called the dark matter admixed neutron star dmans has been considered sandin ciarcelluti 2009 ciarcelluti sandin 2011 leung chu lin 2011 2012 xiang et al 2014 the mechanisms for accumulating dm in a neutron star can result both from the stellar formation process and from subsequent accumulation by accretion of dm particles during the stellar lifetime ciarcelluti sandin 2011 the dm inside the stars alters the structure and may lead to the collapse of a neutron star kouvaris 2012 the structure of these stars is still an open issue because of the unknown nature of dm however it is useful to study the structure of dmanss using existing information on dm the dmans is a two fluid system where the neutron star matter and dm interact only through gravitational force leung chu lin 2012 in order to study the structure of these stars the tolman oppenheimer volkoff tov equation is separated into two different sets for the neutron star and dark components inside the star sandin ciarcelluti 2009 lavallaz fairbairn 2010 ciarcelluti sandin 2011 leung chu lin 2011 2012 the mass radius relation of dmanss which is affected by the dm is one of the observational results that is possible to measure the basic equation for dm to study the structure of dmanss is the dm eos sandin ciarcelluti 2009 ciarcelluti sandin 2011 leung chu lin 2011 xiang et al 2014 applying a method that combines kinematic and gravitational lensing data to test the widely adopted assumption of pressureless dm the dm eos has been measured serra dominguez romero 2011 moreover by modeling galactic halos describing the dm as a nonzero pressure fluid and using observational data of the rotation curves of galaxies a dm eos has been obtained barranco bernal nunez 2015 some previous studies have been performed to investigate the structure of dmanss sandin ciarcelluti 2009 ciarcelluti sandin 2011 leung chu lin 2011 2012 li huang xu 2012 xiang et al 2014 the general relativistic hydrostatic equations have been generalized to spherical objects with multiple fluids that interact by gravity sandin ciarcelluti 2009 moreover assuming that the microphysics is the same in the two sectors of the dmanss the effects of mirror dm on neutron star structure have been studied it was concluded that the structure depends on the relative number of mirror baryons to ordinary baryons supposing that dm is made of some form of stable and long living particles that can accumulate in the star it has been shown that all mass radius measurements can be explained with one nuclear matter eos and a dark core of varying relative size ciarcelluti sandin 2011 consequently observational data which provide a test of the theory will become a powerful tool for the determination of dm ciarcelluti sandin 2011 considering non self annihilating dm particles of mass 1 0 gev along with normal nuclear matter and using a general relativistic two fluid formalism the properties of dmanss have been studied leung chu lin 2011 it was found that a new class of compact stars consisting of a small normal matter core with radius of a few km within a 10 km dm halo can exist employing a general relativistic two fluid formalism to study the admixture of degenerate dm and normal nuclear matter shows that a new class of compact 3 1014 g cm 3 p 1 0 3 5 d yn cm 2 0 10 20 30 40 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 neutron matter equation of state sly 230 b figure 1 neutron matter equation of state in the skyrme framework sly 230 b chabanat et al 1997 stars that are dominated by dm can exist leung chu lin 2012 these stars have a small neutron star matter core with radius of a few km embedded in a larger 10 km dm halo in addition these dmanss have two classes of oscillation modes the first class of modes reduces to the same set of modes for ordinary neutron stars without dm and the second class of modes is due to dm in a consistent dmans model considering dm particles to behave like fermions which interact with a certain repulsive interaction it has been found that dm would soften the eos more strongly than hyperons reducing the maximum mass of the star li huang xu 2012 however with small mass particles the maximum mass could be larger than 2 m the effects of fermionic dm on the properties of neutron stars using the two fluid tov formalism have been studied xiang et al 2014 it has been shown that the mass of dm candidates the amount of dm and interactions among dm candidates affect the mass radius relationship in addition the dm in a dmans results in a spread of mass radius relationships and in some cases the dm distribution can surpass the nm distribution to form a dm halo it has been confirmed that the dm admixture in neutron stars leads to the shrinkage of the nm surface which results in the observation of a small radius moreover the dm distribution can surpass the neutron star matter distribution and form a dm halo when the dm candidates have low mass or there is repulsion of dm with a the large dm fraction in the dmanss the repulsive interaction among dm may result in stars with a mass of above 2 m in the present work we investigate the properties of dmanss using the skyrme interaction in the neutron star matter and the dm eos obtained from the rotational curves of galaxies in a general relativistic two fluid formalism 2 formalism in this study we employ the nm eos that has been derived in the skyrme framework chabanat et al 1997 this equation is the result of the skyrme effective force sly 230 b with the improvement in the behavior with respect to the isospin degree of freedom chabanat et al 1997 the eos of nm in the sly 230 b parametrization is shown in fig ure 1 recently the dm eos has been presented using the velocity profile of galaxies barranco bernal nunez 2015 in this study we apply the pseudo isothermal model in which the dm density profile determines the ve locity profile barranco bernal nunez 2015 the eos for the pseudo isothermal density profile is as follows barranco bernal nunez 2015

dark matter equation of state from the velocity profile of galaxies with the value 0 0 3 10 16 g cm 3 and different values of p 0 in dyn cm 2 unit in the above equation and p are the density and pressure of dm respectively in addition 0 and p 0 are the only free parameters of the eos which for the dm in galaxies correspond to the central density and pressure respectively barranco bernal nunez 2015 it has been found that this eos has a functional dependence that is universal for all galaxies and the mentioned free parameters are related to the evolution history of the galaxy using the eos in equation 1 and the rotational curve data one can predict the central pressure and density of the galaxies here we suppose that the dm in dmanss also behaves according to this eos however one should be careful about the value of the free parameters 0 and p 0 in the eos a logical choice that is similar to the case of galaxies is that the values of 0 and p 0 are of the order of the central density and pressure of neutron stars respectively i e 1015 g cm 3 for the density and 1036 dyn cm 2 for the pressure we consider 12 eoss with the value 0 0 3 1016 g cm 3 and different values of p 0 from 0 1 1035 to 4 0 1035 dyn cm 2 these eoss are presented in figure 2 we should note that we have used units in which g c 1 and therefore the mass density and energy density of dm are equal i e it is clear that the increase in the value of p 0 leads to more stiffness in the eos in addition it is possible to consider dmanss in which the dm sector is composed by free fermions with arbitrary masses narain et al 2007 in this case the eos at zero temperature p is obtained as follows narain et al 2007 1 2 kf 0 k 2 m 2 k 2 dk m 4 8 2 2 z 3 z 1 z 2 1 2 sinh 1 z 2 p 1 3 2 kf 0 k 4 m 2 k 2 dk m 4 24 2 2 z 3 3

mass m 1 0 gev for the fermions is presented in figure 3 in this work we study a dm admixed neutron star with two concentric spheres one containing the nm and the other the dm the eos of nm in the nm sphere is presented in figure 1 and the eoss of dm in the dm sphere are given in figures 2 and 3 in our calculations for the nm sphere in the crust at densities lower than 0 05 fm 3 we use the eos calculated by baym et al 1971 the contribution of dm in the dmans can be different and depends on the history of the star sandin ciarcelluti 2009 and the way that it originates xiang et al 2014 the gravitational field of the normal star in all phases of evolution can affect the dm and capture it into the star this is more probable when the star is more compact in contrast the opposite scenario in which the dm objects trap the baryons has been also proposed ciarcelluti sandin 2011 in this case a more significant contribution of dm in the dmans is expected in this study we explore dmanss with different proportions of dm in the center of the dmans this will be done by considering different central pressure ratios i e central dm pressure to central nm pressure ratio pd r 0 pn r 0 for the dmans the zero pressure ratio 0 shows a normal neutron star in our calculations of the dmans structure we apply the two fluid formalism for the nm and dm presented by sandin ciarcelluti 2009 ciarcelluti sandin 2011 in this formalism it is proposed that dm interacts with nm just through gravity one static and spherically symmetric space time with the line element we use the units in 5 1014

al 2014 it should be noted that the radial dependencies of the pressure and density are different in the two sectors 3 results and discussion figures 4 7 show the total mass of the dmans versus the

is smaller than the radius of a normal neutron star with the same mass this decrease of radius in dmanss is in agreement with previous results leung chu lin 2011 2012 xiang et al 2014 it is obvious that the m rn relations obtained using dmeoss corresponding to p 0 0 2 1035 dyn cm 2 show a behavior like that of normal neutron stars that are gravitationally bound however the other dmeoss which are the stiffer equations of state lead to m rn relations that are significantly different from the normal neutron stars such m rn relations with different slopes representing the self bound dmanss are the result of the interaction between dm and nm the significant effects of the stiff dm equations of state on m rn relations have been also mentioned in xiang et al 2014 our results indicate that the m rn relation for the dmeos with p 0 0 5 1035 dyn cm 2 is approximately in agreement with the result related to the dmeos with m 1 0 gev figures 4 7 show that for some m rn relations with a value of rn two possible dmanss with different masses can exist this is a result of different degrees of dm domination in dmanss put differently two equal sized dmanss that are affected by the dm differently have different masses for example consider a m rn relation with p 0 0 5 1035 dyn cm 2 with this dmeos two dmanss with similar radii 11 25 and 11 36 km have masses of about 0 77 m and 1 67 m respectively the ratios of the mass of the dm sphere to the total mass for these two dmanss are md m 0 13 and md m 0 02 respectively indicating the greater effect of dm in the former in addition in the case of m 1 0 gev two dmanss with radii of 10 41 and 10 39 km have masses of 0 41 m and 1 95 m and the ratios of md m are 0 29 and 0 03 respectively the maximum mass of dmans depends on the dmeoss see table 1 we can see that with all dmeoss the maximum mass of the 7 8 10 12 14 16 0 2 m m su n r n km normal neutron star p 0 0 5 x 10 35 p 0 1 0 x 10 35 p 0 1 5 x 10 35 p 0 2 0 x 10 35 exo 1745 248

show the comparison of observational data with the theoretical results it is obvious that exo 1745 248 with mass m 1 4 0 1 m and radius r 11 1 km can hardly be modeled with the normal neutron star however our model for dmanss with 0 5 1035 dyn cm 2 p 0 1 5 1035 dyn cm 2 or with m 1 0 gev can explain this observational result the neutron star in 4 u 1820 30 with m 1 58 0 06 m and r 9 1 0 4 km and the neutron star in 4 u 1608 52 with m 1 74 0 14 m and r 9 3 1 0 km cannot be normal neutron stars it is clear that the dmeoss with 2 5 1035 dyn cm 2 p 0 4 0 1035 dyn cm 2 corresponding to self bound stars lead to results that are in agreement with the properties of the neutron stars in 4 u 1608 52 and 4 u 1820 30 table 2 presents the mass and radius of the dark and nm spheres relating to the dmanss with the maximum mass it can be seen that for dmanss with dmeoss corresponding to p 0 1 0 1035 dyn cm 2 the significant contribution in the mass is related to the nm sphere in addition in these cases the radius of the dm sphere is smaller than the 8 8 10 12 14 16 0 2 m m su n r n km normal neutron star m 1 0 gev exo 1745 248 4 u 1608 52 4 u 1820 30 gr finite p causality rotation figure

in the dmans with p 0 1 5 1035 dyn cm 2 the dm sphere with the mass 1 63 m is heavier than the nm sphere with the mass 0 15 m in this star the dm halo of radius 19 95 km surrounds the nm sphere of smaller radius 8 16 km this is a dm dominated neutron star we can conclude from the above discussion that the neutron star exo 1745 248 could be a dm dominated neutron star figures 5 and 7 indicate that both dmeoss p 0 1 0 1035 dyn cm 2 and m 1 0 gev which lead to self bound dmanss can be used to explain the observational result of exo 1745 248 moreover table 2 shows that the masses of a dm sphere obtained from these two models i e 0 06 m and 0 05 m respectively are approximately the same in addition the dmeos with p 0 2 5 1035 dyn cm 2 leads to a dmans with a heavier and larger dm sphere compared to the nm sphere consequently this star is also a dm dominated neutron star therefore the neutron stars 4 u 1608 52 and 4 u 1820 30 could be self bound and dm dominated neutron 9 table

while the mass of the dm sphere remains constant at 0 34 m the increase in the value of p 0 reduces the radius of the nm and dm spheres leading to the compactness of the star figures 8 10 show the m

more compact this effect is more significant for the case of m 1 0 gev in addition by increasing the central pressure ratio from 2 to 5 for dmanss with p 0 0 2 1035 dyn cm 2 the radius of the star is not affected however low mass dmanss with p 0 0 4 1035 dyn cm 2 and m 1 0 gev become more compact dmanss with m 1 0 gev are more affected by the value of central pressure ratio compared to the cases with p 0 0 4 1035 dyn cm 2 in the case with m 1 0 gev dmanss with small central pressure ratios i e 0 75 are like normal neutron stars and gravitationally bound however for higher values of central pressure ratio the dmanss are self bound stars we have found from figure 9 that dmanss with the dmeos p 0 0 2 1035 dyn cm 2 and 10 rn km m m su n 8 10 12 0 1 2 3 2 00 3 00 4 00 5 00 gr finite p

10 confirm that the m rn relation can be influenced significantly by the central pressure ratio similar to the results of xiang et al 2014 the results for the maximum masses and corresponding radii are presented in tables 3 5 it can be seen from tables 3 and 4 that for dmanss with p 0 0 2 1035 dyn cm 2 and 2 as well as the dmanss with p 0 0 4 1035 dyn cm 2 the maximum mass decreases by increasing the central pressure ratio in agreement with the results of xiang et al 2014 table 5 also indicates that in the case of fermionic dmeos m 1 0 gev the maximum masses are smaller for 1 than the cases with 1 the total mass versus radius of the nm and dm spheres for different dmeoss and various values of central pressure ratio is given in figures 11 14 these figures show the size of the nm and dm spheres for a dmans with a specific mass we can see that for all values of central pressure ratio the radius of the nm sphere of the star with p 0 0 4 1035 dyn cm 2 is smaller than the case of p 0 0 2 1035 dyn cm 2 with the same mass however it is clear that the radius of the dm sphere of the star with p 0 0 4 1035 dyn cm 2 is larger compared to the case with p 0 0 2 1035 dyn cm 2 figures

stars with p 0 0 2 1035 dyn cm 2 compared to the case of p 0 0 4 1035 dyn cm 2 for all dmeoss by increasing the central pressure ratio the radius of the nm sphere decreases while the radius of the dm sphere increases for stars with p 0 0 4 1035 dyn cm 2 and 3 00 as well as stars with m 1 0 gev and 2 00 we can see that there are low mass dmanss in which the nm sphere is surrounded by a halo of dm which is consistent with previous results leung chu lin 2011 2012 it is evident that with the higher values of for example in stars with p 0 0 4 1035 dyn cm 2 for 5 the nm sphere is surrounded by a halo of dm for all stars tables 6 8 present the mass and radius of the dark and nm spheres of the maximum mass dmanss with different dmeoss and for various values of central pressure ratio we can see that the mass of a dm sphere increases when the central pressure ratio increases this effect is more significant in the case of p 0 0 4 1035 dyn cm 2 in addition with this dmeos the mass of the nm sphere decreases as the central pressure ratio grows in the case with p 0 0 2 1035 dyn cm 2 for all given values of central pressure ratio the mass of the nm sphere is larger than the dm sphere

the neutron dominated dmanss the halo of dm is confined within the nm sphere in contrast in the dm dominated dmanss the nm sphere is located inside the halo of dm which is in agreement with other investigations leung chu lin 2011 2012 considering two stars with the same mass one of them a normal neutron star and the other a dmans in which the nm sphere is surrounded by the halo of dm they have

various values of central pressure ratio in all cases the existence of dm leads to higher values of gravitational redshift compared with normal neutron stars in agreement with previous reports leung

fermionic dmeos with m 1 0 gev and the nm eos from skyrme effective force we have studied the structure of dmanss we have found that the radius of a dmans is smaller than the radius of a normal neutron star with the same mass our results show that the mass radius relations are affected by both the dmeos and central pressure ratio of dm to nm specifically depending on the dmeos and the central pressure ratio the dmans can be a gravitationally or self bound star additionally it has been confirmed that in some cases two dmanss with equal visible radii but different masses can exist this fact is a consequence of different degrees of dm domination in dmanss we have shown that with all dmeoss the maximum mass of the dmans is lower than the normal neutron star the observed neutron stars exo 1745 248 4 u 1608 52 and 4 u 1820 30 which are inconsistent with the previous observations and theoretical properties of normal neutron stars can be explained with our model we have confirmed that some dmeoss and central pressure ratios considered in this work result in dm dominated neutron stars with a halo of dm around a small nm sphere our calculations suggest that the observed neutron stars exo 1745 248 4 u 1608 52 and 4 u 1820 30 may be dm dominated neutron stars it has been clarified that the radius of the nm sphere decreases while the radius of the dm sphere increases as the central pressure ratio grows in addition the mass of the dm sphere increases with the increase of central pressure ratio moreover the dmanss with high values of central pressure ratio are dm dominated neutron stars finally we have shown that the existence of dm in the dmanss results in increased gravitational redshift 16 m msun z s 1 1 5 2 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 normal
