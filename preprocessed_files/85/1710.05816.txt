laboratory parks road oxford ox 1 3 pu england abstract we study matter wave interferometry in the presence of a stochastic background of gravitational waves it is shown that if the background has a scale invariant spectrum over a wide bandwidth which is expected in a class of inflationary models of big bang cosmology then separated path interference cannot be observed for a lump of matter of size above a limit which is very insensitive to the strength and bandwidth of the fluctuations unless the interferometer is servo controlled or otherwise protected for ordinary solid matter this limit is of order 1 10 mm a servo controlled or cross correlated device would also exhibit limits to the observation of macroscopic interference which we estimate for ordinary matter moving at speeds small compared to c keywords gravitational wave matter wave interferometry cosmic inflation decoherence 1 introduction in a series of papers lamine et al 1 2 have investigated the effect of a stochastic background of weak gravitational waves on matter wave interferome ters we use their treatment to obtain the following remarkable observation if the early universe generated gravitational waves with a scale invariant spectrum over a wide bandwidth which is expected in a class of inflationary models of big bang cosmology we show that there is a near universal cut off distance scale for the observation of matter wave interference that is unless the interferometer as in figure 1 a is shielded or otherwise protected from these primordial waves the fringe visibility will go rapidly to zero when the radius r of the interfering object exceeds a value which turns out to be of the order of a few millimetres for ordinary solid matter this is not an absolutely unavoidable decoherence only a technological difficulty so it is not possible to settle the quantum mea surement problem by this route however we also find that cross correlation or servo control will not suffice to avoid the decoherene altogether but merely email address a steane physics ox ac uk andrew m steane preprint submitted to elsevier september 18 2018 http arxiv org abs 1710 05816 v 1 r 2 r figure 1 a sphere of radius r passes through a two path interferometer whose path separation is 2 r in practice the mirrors and beam splitters might for example be provided by magnetic or optical forces extend the size or mass limit by an amount which depends weakly on the in tegration time to avoid this source of decoherence altogether it would suffice to shield the interferometer from the fluctuating gravitational background but this is very hard to do 2 calculation we are interested in a generic interferometer but for the sake of making precise calculations we consider a mach zehnder interferometer in which de broglie waves associated with a sphere of proper radius r interfere and in which the separation of the arms is 2 r see figure 1 a for such an interferometer both the interfering object and the separation of the interfering paths becomes of macroscopic size when r is large enough our treatment follows that of lamine et al 1 2 3 in the presence of a stochastic gravitational background with a spectral density of strain fluctuations sh the variance of the phase of a matter wave interferometer of the type shown in figure 1 is 2 0 d 2 sh a f 1 where a is the response of the interferometer to a wave of given frequency and f is a high pass filter function for the case where the sphere s group velocity v c and the wavelength of the gravitational wave is large compared to the interferometer kr 1 one finds 2 a 4 mv 2 2 sin 2 2 sin 4 2 2 where r v sin is the time taken to traverse half of one arm of the interferometer the filter function represents the fact that low frequency noise is not noise but signal if the fringes move slowly enough then their movement can be tracked by the interference experiment we adopt the filter function f 2 0 5 10 5 10 20 0 5 10 15 15 big bang

will discuss this bandwidth af ter obtaining an expression for 2 in the presence of stochastic cosmological gravity waves sources of gravitational waves include various ordinary processes such as neutron star binaries black hole binaries and rotating neutron stars and ex otic processes that are not yet well established but which are postulated in theoretical descriptions of early universe physics figure 2 6 5 9 7 8 we suppose the waves from ordinary sources represent a signal which can be dis criminated by its temporal and other signatures and therefore the noise is only given by the exotic sources this is outside the present range of confident knowledge but inflationary models of big bang cosmology suggest that there is now throughout the universe a low level gravitational noise of very wide bandwidth observations of the cosmic microwave background can in principle detect this gravitational noise at very low frequencies through the sachs wolfe effect 12 13 this is not the frequency range we are interested in but it is useful because it is by far the most sensitive existing experimental observation the wmap and planck measurements currently place an upper bound on the low frequency gravitational noise close to the level at which inflationary models suggest it is present thus it remains undetected but the models remain viable 8 the cosmological gravitational wave spectrum is usually described in terms of the measure gw 0 c 2 where 0 is the mass density that would close the universe and is the spectral energy density of the gravitational radiation that is the energy density per unit frequency range gw is dimension less and is related to sh by sh 3 h 2 0 gw 3 where h 0 2 4 10 18 s 1 is 3 10 2 10 1 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 4 10 3 10 2 10 1 10 0 figure 3 full curve integral in eq 3 for c dashed curve the function 3 1 20 1 4 10 2 2 1 the hubble parameter 14 the important point for our discussion is that infla tionary models suggest that gw is independent of over a wide bandwidth a property called scale invariance the bandwidth is normally reported in the range 107 109 hz we will model this by adopting a simple cut off at a fre quency c hence eq 1 reads 2 c 0 d 2 3 h 2 0 gw 3 a 2 2 2 24 h 2 0 c 2 m 2 v 4 c 0 sin 4 x 2 x 3 x 2 2 2 dx 3 the integrand in 3 falls quickly once x 2 with the result that the integral is almost independent of c for c 2 it is then well approximated except at very low by the expression 2 24 3 h 2 0 gw 2 m 2 v 4 1 20 1 4 10 n 4 where n 2 see figure 3 the parameter n allows us to consider the effect of different filter functions for example a perfect high pass filter with a sharp cut off at results in a response given approximately by eq 4 with n 4 the above calculation has assumed a point like model of the interfering sphere and treats the case where the gravitational wavelength is large com pared to the interferometer i e cr c which implies r 0 05 m when c 2 109 s 1 in order to allow for the extended nature of the interfering sphere we must consider the fact that for any given arm of the interferometer different parts of the sphere may experience different amounts of proper time consequently the coordinate associated with the finally measured position of 4 the sphere may become entangled with internal degrees of freedom leading to decoherence when the latter are averaged over 15 a symmetric bow tie de sign for the interferometer can cancel the static part of this effect but for a randomly fluctuating background as here the result is a loss of coherence and it is one that cannot be avoided by acquiring data quickly so as to track the fluctuations consequently a reasonable rough model of this is to extend the validity of eq 4 to all values of r but insist that the bandwidth of the in terferometer must satisfy c r so that high frequency fluctuations always contribute to 2 this is a reasonable approach when the arm separation of the interferometer is similar to the size of the interfering object as here the result 4 has some interesting properties we have v r sin so for any given value of 4 gives mr 2 sin 2 the standard deviation of the phase is proportional to a quadrupole moment associated with m and the size of the interferometer the interference fringe visibility falls rapidly to zero once for a uniform sphere of density one has m 4 3 r 3 so the critical radius above which any interference pattern is washed out is given by rc 3 2 512 h 2 0 1 10 1 20 1 4 10 n 1 10 1 5 1 10 gw 5 taking 4 as a result of this one tenth power rc is very insensitive to gw 3 discussion first consider a single interferometer the maximum rate at which data points can be acquired is v 2 r 2 sin 1 this gives a rough estimate of the bandwidth hence for this case 1 and in this region rc is almost independent of hence we can make a simple statement of near universal validity there is a size of a lump of ordinary matter above which interference of the type under discussion is not observable unless the inteferometer is some how shielded from or servo controlled to adjust for the primordial cosmological gravity waves assuming they are there we find that for a silica sphere for ex ample the critical radius is 3 mm for gw 10 15 and 8 mm for gw 10 19 the sphere s mass is then m 0 3 grams and m 4 6 grams respectively the values for solid spheres of other common materials are of this same order this rules out an observation of interference of the type under discussion unless the interferometer is shielded from such gravity waves or the local spacetime curvature is measured rapidly enough to allow the interference pattern to be stabilised by servo control by using many interferometers together the data rate can be made arbi trarily high then the effective bandwidth is given by the condition that the interferometers must be spaced by 2 r and therefore they are only correlated for fluctuations with correlation length 2 r this implies that the maximum possible bandwidth made available by such cross correlation is c r and 5 we have already asserted that in order to allow for the finite extension of the sphere the value of must be taken small compared to this we consider the case c 10 r then 10 sin c v which is 1 since the whole discussion has assumed v c the result is that the previous values of rc have to be multiplied by c 10 v n 10 so now the critical radius depends on v though not strongly at v 1 m s one finds rc 0 12 m 4 7 m for a silica sphere when gw 10 15 and n 2 4 respectively at small v the interferometer is less sensitive to the noise from gravity waves but it then becomes more sensitive to other sources of decoherence such as mechanical instability black body radiation magnetic field noise and collisions with background gas molecules 16 4 conclusion to sum up the fact that a fluctuating background of gravitational waves will cause decoherence is not in itself the main result of this paper both this and the mathematical tools to calculate such effects were already established by previous authors the main observation of the present work is contained in eqs 4 and 5 it is that when such a stochastic background has a scale invariant spectrum over a wide frequency range then matter wave interference becomes unobservable in an unprotected interferometer for ordinary solid objects above a size which is independent of their velocity for v c and which depends very little on the strength of the stochastic background this size is of the order millimetres to centimetres in the case of larger objects one could in principle still detect interference through the use of cross correlation or servo control methods however the present study suggests that this only extends the size range up to a few metres for ordinary matter traversing the interferometer on a timescale of order sec onds we say suggests rather than shows since we have only presented a rough estimate of this case nevertheless these calculations suffice to show that it is questionable whether it makes sense to assert that large objects can exhibit in terference effects over large path separations in the context of the universe as it is if indeed the universe has a broad stochastic gravitational wave background this issue has already been raised by lamine et al 1 2 our contribution has been to focus attention on some aspects which are remarkable in their simplicity and generality we have used the density of silica 2329 kg m 3 for the numerical examples the critical distance scale varies as the minus one fifth power of this very low density objects of somewhat larger size may therefore exhibit interference applied to a sphere having the density of the degenerate matter of a neutron star the calculation gives rc 10 m it would be interesting to explore the issue what limits might there be for interference of the matter waves that are presumably associated with a black hole this is outside the range of applica bility of the methods employed here lamine et al 2 claim that the decoherence associated with this mech anism constitutes the quantum classical transition and that interferometers 6 cannot be shielded against this type of noise such claims are not formally justified because one can in principle propose a thought experiment which em ployed gravitational shielding passive shielding might for example employ vast amounts of viscous matter which absorbed the energy of gravitational waves active shielding might employ a massive distortable membrane plus servo mech anisms designed to generate a canceling gravitational wave signal an interest ing avenue to explore is whether or not there is any fundamental reason why such schemes could not in principle succeed in restoring the coherence of a matter wave interference experiment our treatment employed ordinary quantum theory on a classical spacetime described by general relativity it therefore makes no proposal regarding new physics beyond that model however if a quantum theory of gravity led to effects that were phenomenologically similar to those of a broadband random fluctuation in spacetime one which was unavoidable then we would have a possible route to settling the quantum classical divide calculations such as those in this paper and cited works would then indicate how the resulting limit to interference phenomena relates to the
