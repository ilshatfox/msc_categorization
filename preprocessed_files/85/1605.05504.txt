preprint online version november 14 2021 abstract on the asymptotic giant branch agb low and intermediate mass stars eject a large fraction of their envelope but the mechanism driving these outflows is still poorly understood for oxygen rich agb stars the wind is thought to be driven by radiation pressure caused by scattering of radiation off dust grains we use high angular resolution images obtained with sphere zimpol to study the photosphere the warm molecular layer and the inner wind of the close by oxygen rich agb star r doradus and its inner envelope we present observations in filters v cnth and cnt 820 and investigate the surface brightness distribution of the star and of the polarised light produced in the inner envelope thanks to second epoch observations in cnth we are able to see variability on the stellar photosphere we study the polarised light data using a continuum radiative transfer code that accounts for direction dependent scattering of photons off dust grains we find that in the first epoch the surface brightness of r dor is asymmetric in v and cnth the filters where molecular opacity is stronger while in cnt 820 the surface brightness is closer to being axisymmetric the second epoch observations in cnth show that the morphology of r dor has changed completely in a timespan of 48 days to a more axisymmetric and compact configuration this variable morphology is probably linked to changes in the opacity provided by tio molecules in the extended atmosphere the observations show polarised light coming from a region around the central star the inner radius of the region from where polarised light is seen varies only by a small amount with azimuth the value of the polarised intensity however varies by between a factor of 2 3 and 3 7 with azimuth for the different images we fit the radial profile of the polarised intensity using a spherically symmetric model and a parametric description of the dust density profile r r n on average we find exponents of 4 5 0 5 that correspond to a much steeper density profile than that of a wind expanding at constant velocity the dust densities we derive imply an upper limit for the dust to gas ratio of 2 10 4 at 5 0 r considering all the uncertainties in observations and models this value is consistent with the minimum values required by wind driving models for the onset of a wind of 3 3 10 4 however if the steep density profile we find extends to larger distances from the star the dust to gas ratio will quickly become too small for the wind of r dor to be driven by the grains that produce the scattered light key words 1 introduction the asymptotic giant branch agb is one of the final stages of the evolution of low and intermediate mass stars when a slow and dense outflow develops habing olofsson 2003 the wind is thought to be driven by radiation pressure on dust grains that can only form because pulsations enhance the density scale height of the stellar atmospheres for oxygen rich agb stars where the carbon to oxygen ratio is lower than one it has been proposed that large translucent dust grains provide the required opacity and drive the wind through scattering of photons ho fner 2008 however many intricacies of the formation and process ing of the oxygen rich dust grains remain poorly constrained send offprint requests to t khouri e mail theokhouri gmail com from observations the translucent nature of these grains im plies that they are not expected to produce significant infrared emission and hence most likely cannot be identified from in frared spectra the best way to study such grains is through the scattered stellar light they are expected to produce to advance our understanding of the agb mass loss we use high angular resolution observations acquired with sphere zimpol beuzit et al 2008 on the very large telescope vlt to investigate light polarised through scattering off dust grains in the inner wind of the agb star r doradus this oxygen rich star with spectral type m 8 has a large angular diam eter in the sky 57 mas and a relatively low mass loss rate be tween 0 9 and 2 0 10 7 m yr 1 olofsson et al 2002 maercker et al

authors found that a model with grain radii of 0 3 m and a inner radius of the dust envelope of 43 3 mas gives the best fit to the data 2 observations 2 1 data acquisition and data reduction r dor was observed with zimpol during the sphere science verification time using three filters v cnth and cnt 820 the observations were taken in two epochs 10 and 11 of december 2014 v cnth and cnt 820 and 28 of january 2015 cnth the total integration times for each filter and epoch are given in table 1 observations using filter cnt 820 were done both with and without a neutral density nd filter in the images obtained without the nd filter the star saturated the detector when the first epoch cnth images were taken the seeing was too high 1 2 for an optimal behaviour of the instrument therefore these data have to be interpreted with care the observations of r dor resulted in individual data cubes containing the frames recorded with the two cameras of the in strument both equiped with the same filter we processed these cubes individually using the data reduction pipeline of the in strument in its pre release version 0 14 01 each cube produced stokes q q u and u frames for the two cameras to gether with intensity frames iq and iu we then aligned and de rotated the resulting average frames using custom python routines we adopt a pixel scale of 3 602 0 011 mas pix 1 and a position angle of the vertical axis with respect to north of 357 95 0 55 deg ch ginski in prep recently new direction dependent corrections to the pixel scale of less than 0 5 have been determined see ginski et al in prep since these are much smaller than the uncertainties from choosing the central pixel see section 3 2 for the region we consider we have not in cluded them we deconvolved the total intensity images only using the lucy richardson l r algorithm implemented in the iraf 2 software package the point spread function psf reference images of 2 ori were taken on the night of 31 march 2015 under comparable seeing conditions 0 9 as the r dor ob servations for the cnt 820 filter we adopted the psf observation in the tio 717 filter with 716 8 m and 19 7 m as no other psf observation in the cnt 820 filter was available we stopped the l r deconvolution after 80 iterations as the de convolved images do not show a significant evolution in addi tional processing steps since the psf images were not acquired simultaneously to the images of r dor we only show the de convolved images to illustrate what the underlying source mor phology might be all the quantities that we present and model were extracted from the observed images and not from the de convolved ones 2 2 observational results 2 2 1 the stellar photosphere we first discuss the total intensity stokes i images the high spatial

images figs 1 and 2 the images acquired in the first epoch re veal a very asymmetrical source with a horseshoe shaped mor phology both in v and in cnth in these images more emission arises from the northern hemisphere and there is a region of low surface brightness in the south west we find an azimuthally averaged full width at half maximum fwhm in v and cnth in this epoch of 71 mas see table 1 this asymmetric mor phology is not as prominent in the cnt 820 images and the source is also smaller at this wavelength with fwhm 58 3 mas the surface brightness distribution of r dor in cnth changes between the two epochs of observation fig 2 in jan 2015 emission is concentrated in the central region and the in tensity distribution is more axisymmetric different from what is seen in the first epoch in the second epoch the disc of r dor has a fwhm 59 4 mas in cnth for reference the 48 days that separate the two epochs correspond to slightly more than one fourth of the shortest pulsation period of r dor 175 days the values of the fwhm measured in the second epoch in filters cnt 820 and cnth are comparable to the stellar radius for a uniform disc obtained by norris et al 2012 of 27 2 mas from observations that probe the stellar continuum in the near infrared however the values of the fwhm in the first epoch in v and in cnth are significantly larger than that see table 1 a strong dependence of the size of the stellar disc on wave length is a known feature of agb stars for instance the mea sured uniform disc diameters in the near infrared is found to correlate with molecular spectral bands of co and h 2 o see e g wittkowski et al 2008 woodruff et al 2009 in the visi ble wavelength range tio is expected to be the main source of opacity for a late type m star as r dor this molecule is found to dominate the spectrum in the wavelength range of v and cnth but its opacity is lower in the wavelength range of filter cnt 820 for comparison molecular contribution is expected to be very small in the wavelengths that norris et al performed their ob servations for examples of spectra of late type stars with band identification see e g lanc on wood 2000 jacob et al 1997 measured the diameter of r dor in the pseudo continuum region around 0 82 m and in a tio absorp tion band at 0 85 m and found the stellar diameter to be 20 larger in the tio band follow up observations jacob et al 2004 between 0 65 m and 0 99 m confirmed that the stellar disc size increases in the tio bands ireland et al 2004 found asymmetries in the stellar disc of r dor in the same wavelength range observed by jacob et al 2004 the authors however could not determine whether these asymmetries were caused by variations in molecular excitation or in the light scattered by dust grains since we find that the size and the morphology of the stel lar disc change considerably while the polarisation degree does not decrease significantly see section 2 2 2 we conclude that the difference in fwhm the asymmetries and the variation in morphology are mainly caused by variability of molecular tio opacity the variability in tio opacity can be caused by changes in the gas density and or in the molecular abundance or excitation hydrodynamical models calculated with the code co 5 bold freytag 2013 for a star with a few solar masses show that con vective motions can produce large scale density variations on time scales comparable to the one we find 3 however these mod els lack a realistic wavelength dependent radiative transfer that takes into account molecular opacity as molecular excitation and hence the surface brightness of the stellar disc is signifi cantly affected by density variations by episodic dissipation of 3 see http www astro uu se bf for the model results 2 ftp

the dashed blue circles enclose the regions where we find the polarised intensity produced in the envelope to be a factor of three larger than the expected instrumental po larisation not shown for cnt 820 see section 2 2 2 of the output integrated polarised flux this is because in the q and u images the negative and positive lobes from a symmetrical envelope can overlap when the resolution is lowered this leads to polarised signal in the images to cancel out the poorer the angular resolution the larger is the effect the convolved q and u images were then combined to obtain the polarised intensity for each model we calculated the radial profile of the polarised intensity from the observations for each octant and compared these pro files independently to the models we considered two different envelope structures with dust grains distributed in a thin halo with constant density model with no outflow and with a dust density gradient given by r r r n r being the inner radius of the dust envelope and r we varied r be tween 1 2 r and 2 0 r for both envelope structures and the halo thicknesses between 0 25 r and 1 5 r for the thin halo scenario where r 27 2 mas norris et al 2012 we use amorphous mg 2 sio 4 grains with the optical con stants obtained by ja ger et al 2003 as this dust species is one of the main candidates for driving the winds of oxygen rich agb stars see e g bladh ho fner 2012 we have also ex perimented with optical constants for mg 2 sio 3 and al 2 o 3 as discussed in section 4 1 2 to calculate the absorption opacities and the direction dependent scattering properties we approxi mate the actual size distribution of particle sizes by a distribu tion of hollow spheres min et al 2003 we consider the radii a to be given by the standard distribution for grains in the in terstellar medium n a a 3 5 mathis et al 1977 the mini 5 t khouri et al a study of r dor using zimpol mum amin and maximum amax grain radii of the distribution were varied to fit the observations see section 4 1 our fits are only sensitive to grains with a 0 1 m since smaller grains do not provide significant scattering opacity for distributions with amin 0 01 m and amax between 0 2 m and 0 5 m the amount of mass in grains with a 0 1 m is roughly between 40 and 70 3 2 observational contraints our models only consider opacity due to dust grains while molecular absorption may also be very important close to the star neglecting this source of opacity will probably cause us to overestimate the inner radius of the dust envelope this is be cause photons scattered close to the star where the gas densities are high have a larger chance of being absorbed before escaping the envelope hence the inner radius of the dust envelope would appear larger instrumental polarisation may also affect the observations though data reduction procedures reduce it to about 0 5 this residual instrumental polarisation mainly affects the data at pro jected distances 100 mas from the central source to minimise the errors introduced we only analysed the polarised light from the inner region up to 127 mas from the star where the polari sation degree is larger than 1 5 and where we see the expected behaviour of the polarisation angles for the image in v and the two images in cnth we fit our models to the integrated polarised fraction ipf the maximum polarised fraction mpf and the radial profile of the polarised intensity we define the ipf as the polarised inten sity integrated within a radius of 127 mas divided by the total intensity integrated over the same region the mpf is the maxi mum value of the polarised fraction per octant integrated within a radius of 127 mas divided by the total intensity integrated over a circle with a 127 mas radius these observed quantities are given in table 1 the errors given are the 1 uncertainties de rived from the uncertainties on the polarised intensity we also compared our models to the radial profile of the total intensity to set upper limits on the dust densities the ipf in the image in v is significantly smaller than those in cnth in both epochs the polarised signal in the first epoch cnth image can be affected by the not ideal conditions when the data were taken specifically the strehl ratio in that image is different from that in the reference psf 2 ori which was taken under good sky conditions this can cause more instru mental polarisation to be produced affecting the ipf we mea sure this is specially important in the regions where the polari sation degree is low 1 the effect of the worse conditions can be seen in the images of the direction of the polarisation vectors fig 4 the first epoch image in cnth shows the sig nal from circumstellar polarisation up to a smaller distance than the second epoch image this would not be expected if both im ages had been taken under equal conditions because in the first epoch exposure time was longer nonetheless decreasing the ra dius of integration from 127 mas to 110 mas only reduces the value we obtain for the ipf by a factor of 1 01 therefore the effect of the worse sky conditions on the ipf are not significant moreover the observations in jan 2015 also show a high ipf in cnth this leads us to conclude that the higher ipf in cnth when compared to that in v is a real feature of the inner en velope of r dor however we were not able to reproduce this wavelength dependence of the ipf with our models which al ways show higher ipf in v or at most similar values of the ipf between the two filters an important consideration is that the measured ipf can be suppressed by molecular absorption this is because the scat tered photons travel longer through the envelope than photons that do not interact and hence have a higher probability of being absorbed by molecules this causes the ipf produced by scatter ing off dust grains to decrease if the molecular absorption opac ity increases in a given wavelength given these considerations it is more likely that polarised photons in the v band are ab sorbed by molecules than artificially created in cnth because of instrumental polarisation therefore we consider the values measured in cnth as more representative of the ipf produced by the dust this approach also guarantees that we do not un derestimate the dust densities we derive hence we fit our mod els to the uncertainty weighed averaged ipf in cnth from both epochs combined of 2 35 0 1 in order to calculate radial profiles we need to define a cen tral pixel but the complex morphology of the source makes this determination difficult for reference the fwhm of r dor in the total intensity images in v is of roughly 20 pixels 72 mas see table 1 we have chosen the central pixel in the images in v as the one more closely equidistant from the peak of polarised light for different azimuths the central pixels in the other fil ters were chosen by establishing the best match when overlay ing the polarised light images with those in v by following this approach we find that the chosen central pixels differ from the centre of light by a distance of one 3 6 mas or two pixels 7 2 mas for the images in v and in both epochs in cnth the pix els where the total intensity peaks differ from our chosen central pixel by a distance of between 3 10 8 mas and 4 pixels 14 4 mas for the image in v and the first epoch image in cnth for the second epoch image in cnth in which the stellar disc is more axisymmetric the intensity peaks on our chosen central pixel these considerations support our approach for determin ing the central pixel the uncertainty caused by the choice of the central pixel on the derived radial profiles of the polarised inten sity was taken as the maximum difference between considering the chosen central pixels or one of its eight neighbouring pix els this approach overestimates the uncertainty on the slope of the radial profile of the polarised intensity the effect of consid ering different central pixels on the ipf and mpf is negligible compared to the uncertainty of the measurements in fig 6 we compare the radial profiles for the eight oc tants in the images in v and in cnth the profiles were nor malised using the integrated polarised intensity for each filter the radial profiles obtained from the three images are very simi lar and agree well within the uncertainties the fact that the pro files from cnth in the first epoch deviate slightly from the other two for r 3 r can be attributed to the worse conditions when those observations were taken and to a higher instrumental po larisation 4 results and discussion we were not able to determine the particle size from the wave length dependence of the scattering this is because of the ex pected contribution of molecular opacity in the wavelength range of the observations that can disrupt the wavelength dependence imprinted by scattering we infer that molecular opacity is im portant in

investigated whether a high value of is enough to reproduce the mpf 4 1 the integrated polarised fraction and the radial profile of the polarised intensity optical depth effects become important when we consider grain size distributions with maximum radii amax between 0 2 m and 0 5 m for these values of amax our models require an aver age optical depth v 1 to reproduce the observed ipf in the optically thick regime our fit parameters r and n cannot be determined independently typically the ipf we obtain from our models is larger the larger the dust mass within the region of integration 127 mas however when v 2 increasing and hence the dust mass does not lead to a larger ipf because of the effect of multiple scattering also for v 1 5 the peak of the radial profile of the polarised intensity becomes broader and shifts to larger radii in comparison to optically thin models this causes models with v 1 5 to require smaller values of r and larger values of n when compared to optically thin models our models with v 1 5 require r 1 45 0 1 r and 3 5 n 5 with an average best fitting value of n 4 5 to fit the radial profile of the polarised intensity a model with v 3 5 requires r 1 2 and n 5 5 instead 4 1 1 constraints from the total intensity images although we do not attempt to fit the unpolarised surface bright ness of r dor we use the radial profile of the total

limit on v applies to both epochs this reinforces the conclusion that the variability and asymmetries in the total in tensity images in the first epoch are caused by molecular opacity we conclude that models with scattering optical depths 1 2 do not provide acceptable fits to the data moreover the value derived by norris et al 2012 for the inner radius of the dust envelope of r dor of r 1 6 r is in better agreement with what we obtain for models with v 1 5 since the scattering opacities in the wavelengths of the observa tions of norris et al are roughly one order of magnitude lower than those in the wavelength range of our observations it is unlikely that their results are affected by high scattering opti cal depths in the envelope this reinforces the conclusion that optically thin models are preferred 4 1 2 larger grain sizes and different dust species we have tested the effect of increasing amax to values between 0 6 m and 1 0 m we find that such models produce lower values of the ipf for a given optical depth when compared to models with smaller values of amax therefore the effects of high v are stronger the larger amax for amax 0 1 m we have also experimented using optical constants for amor phous al 2 o 3 koike et al 1995 and mgsio 3 dorschner et al 1995 with all other parameters kept constant we find ipf val ues that differ only by a few percent from those obtained us ing mg 2 sio 4 we conclude that the effect of the assumed grain species on our results is small 4 1 3 the radial profile of the dust density the best fits to the observed radial profile measured in v are shown in fig 8 in table 3 we show reduced 2 values for these same models fit to the normalised profile of the observed po larised flux as can be seen models with dust grains confined to a thin halo are not able to reproduce the observations for r 2 5 r while models with n 3 have dust density profiles that are too shallow and that overpredict the observed polarised intensity also for r 2 5 r the dust density profiles we find are not sensitive to the size of the particles we consider as long as the optical depth in the visual v does not vary the best fitting values of v and for models with differ ent minimum and maximum grain sizes are given in table 4 the dust density profiles n 4 5 we obtain are steeper than that of a wind expanding with constant speed n 2 this can be the result of acceleration of destruction of the dust grains in the observed region of a decreasing mass loss rate on short time scales or be caused by the density structure imprinted by consecutive shock waves in the inner envelope as predicted by 1 d wind driving models see e g ho fner et al 2003 for gas density profiles from models for carbon stars ireland et al 2005 observed polarised light from two low mass loss rate and oxygen rich agb stars r car and rr sco and found that the data was better reproduced by a model with a central star surrounded by a thin shell instead of an outflow if these sources also have steep density profiles in the inner wind the structure they interpreted as a thin shell might actually be the edge of a dust envelope similar to that of r dor our models produce values of the scattered light fractions in the near infrared roughly a factor of 3 5 larger than those re ported by norris et al 2012 for r dor it is not clear whether this is caused by variability of r dor between the times of the two observations by systematic errors in the data acquisition methods or by differences in the models used by us and by norris et al to derive these quantities 4 2 the maximum polarised fraction we estimated the variation in required to reproduce the dif ference in the observed polarisation degree between the octants we are not able to reproduce the mpf in cnth 3 with models that have amax 0 2 m because the model envelopes become too optically thick and do not reach such high polarised fractions by considering amax 0 1 m we are able to fit the ob served ipf with much lower maximum optical depths of 0 2 and we are then able to reproduce the mpf norris et al 2012 report grains of 0 3 m in the outflow of r dor this value is in the range of grain radii for which we cannot reproduce the mpf 4 2 1 tangential optical depths given the considerable optical depths in the wavelengths we ob serve asymmetries can cause tangential optical depths in the en velope to be significantly different from those in our spherically symmetrical model the tangential optical depths are measured along the line of sight and in the direction of the observer be tween the plane of scattering and the outer edge of the envelope for lines of sight with lower tangential optical depths more po larised photons can escape in this case the mpf could be re produced by an envelope with grains with amax 0 2 m and tangential optical depths varying with azimuth in order for the polarised intensity from one octant to be a factor of 1 5 higher than that of a spherically symmetric model the tangential opti cal depth would have to be 0 4 smaller given that the optical depths we find are of order unity this would imply a decrease of the tangential optical depth of roughly 40 for the octants with maximum polarisation since the polarised fraction would depend on both the tangential optical depth and on for each octant for non spherically symmetric envelopes we have not ex plored this possibility further 4 3 comparison with zimpol results for w hya ohnaka et al 2016 reported sphere zimpol observations of the o rich agb star w hya that resolved the direct stellar emission and

visible wavelengths of 1 since the polarisation degree reported by ohnaka et al for w hya is comparable to what we find for r dor and the mass loss rate of w hya of 1 3 10 7 m yr 1 khouri et al 2014 is similar to that of r dor the differences between the results reported by ohnaka et al and ours are not expected ohnaka et al used a non spherically symmetric radiative transfer model to reproduce the observations this might af fect the derived optical depths because the tangential optical depths can be considerably different from a spherically symmet ric model see section 4 2 1 moreover the authors constrained the dust mass also taking into account the scattered light frac tions reported by norris et al 2012 for w hya therefore the differences in the derived optical depths might be related to the fact that we overpredict the scattered light fractions given by norris et al for r dor see section 4 1 3 however we are not able to determine the cause of these discrepancies and further investigation is needed we note that if our models underestimate the polarised flux for a given value of the optical depth of the envelope the dust densities we find will be overestimated hence the actual dust densities and the dust to gas ratio in the envelope will be smaller than the values we report 4 4 dust grains as wind drivers we now investigate whether the grains we see around r dor are sufficient for driving the wind wind driving models indicate that the minimum dust to gas ratio d g for a wind to develop is d g 6 10 4 ho fner 2008 or even d g 3 3 10 4 bladh et al 2015 4 these models consider grains of a single radius which is typically 0 2 m we estimate an empirical upper limit for the d g at a radius r in the envelope of r dor by considering a lower limit for the gas density gas r m gas 4 r 2 and the dust density profiles we find we use the parameters commonly obtained for the gaseous out flow of r dor of m gas 9 10 8 m yr 1 and 5 7 km s 1 see e g khouri 2014 this should give us a robust lower limit on the gas densities since the gas expansion velocities are ex pected to be smaller than close to the star for the dust density profile we use n 4 5 and the average density from the model with only large grains 3 10 18 g cm 3 as this is the model more directly compa rable to the single grain size models of ho fner and bladh et al this choice should not have a strong effect on our results be 4 both studies report silicon condensation fractions we calculated the d g by adopting solar silicon abundances asplund et al 2009 9 t khouri et al a study of r dor using zimpol cause at a given distance from the star all our best fitting mod els have densities of grains with a 0 15 m which are al ways smaller or very similar to that of the model with only large grains we find d g 5 5 10 3 at r 1 5 r and d g 5 2 10 4 at r 5 0 r although the upper limit for the d g we derive at r 1 5 r does not provide strong constraints the low value for the upper limit at r 5 0 r shows that at that radius the d g in the outflow of r dor is close to the limit of what wind driving models require we note that our results can underestimate the dust densities if the polarisation efficiency of the grains is overes timated by our model however this would imply higher scatter ing optical depths for the envelope which our results disfavour given the low expansion velocity and mass loss rate of r dor a low value of the d g is not unexpected however if the steep radial profile of the dust density extends beyond 5 r the d g would soon become too low for the dust to provide the required opacity to drive the outflow this would be a problem because the maximum expansion velocity of the outflow of r dor only equals the escape velocity of a 1 m star at r 35 r and hence the radiation pressure force would have to be larger than the gravitational pull up to that distance 5 summary and conclusions we have observed the oxygen rich agb star r dor using sphere zimpol on the vlt in three filters v cnth and cnt 820 observations in cnth were acquired in two epochs 48 days apart the stellar disc is resolved in all observations and we are able to study asymmetries and variability in the star we find the total intensity distribution of r dor to have a horseshoe shaped morphology in the first epoch both in v and in cnth in the pseudo continuum filter cnt 820 the stellar disc is smaller and any departures from axisymmety are much less pronounced in the second epoch taken 48 days later the image in cnth shows a source with a very different morphology moreover the stellar disc is significantly smaller than in the first epoch image in the same filter and is comparable in size to what we see in cnt 820 also in the first epoch we interpret these differences in size and morphology as being caused by variability in the excita tion and or density of tio molecules in the extended atmosphere of the star we detect polarised light coming from a ring that encloses the central source and that spans a similar region in the three im ages we consider in v and the two epochs in cnth however the polarised intensity varies significantly with azimuth for the three images and the ratio of the polarised intensity between two images also varies somewhat with azimuth we find the integrated polarised fraction in v to be smaller than those in cnth in the two epochs and the integrated polarised fraction to increase in cnth from the first to the second epoch our fits to the integrated polarised fraction and the radial profile of the polarised intensity show that we see outflowing dust grains considering models with dust density profiles of the type r r n we find that the dust density decreases much more steeply with radius than expected for a wind expanding at con stant speed this can be caused by the acceleration of the wind but could also be explained by destruction of the dust grains or by a varying mass loss rate on short time scales we use our best fitting dust models and literature values for the gaseous outflow to calculate upper limits for the dust to gas ratio as a function of radius we compare the limits we obtain to results from wind driving models and we find that the up per limit we derive for the dust to gas ratio at 5 r is somewhat lower than the minimum values required by such models for a wind to develop given the approximations we use for the grain model and the envelope structure the upper limit we find for the dust to gas ratio is consistent with the value found in wind driving models however if the steep dust density gradient we derive extends to larger radii the dust to gas ratio would surely become too small for the outflow to be driven given the low ex pansion velocity of the outflow of r dor the wind only reaches the escape velocity of a one solar mass star about 35 r from the central star therefore if the grains we see are the main source of opacity that drives the wind we would expect a flattening in the power law of the dust density profile not much farther out than the maximum radius we probe further investigation of the outflow of r dor will help to bet ter understand how its wind is accelerated particularly deeper observations using zimpol can probe the dust density farther out in the envelope to better constrain the role of the scattering grains in driving the wind similar studies for other agb stars will show whether what we see for r dor is representative in any way and how the distribution of the dust in the inner wind changes for different stars this will help advance our knowl edge of the driving of agb outflows and of the agb evolution in general acknowledgements this work was supported by the swedish research council m m has received funding from the
