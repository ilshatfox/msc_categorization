1 and a t bajkova central pulkovo astronomical observatory russian academy of sciences st petersburg 196140 russia abstract we analyze the spatial and kinematic properties of a large sample of young t tauri type stars in a 500 pc radius solar neighborhood closely related to the gould belt the following parameters of the exponential density distribution have been determined the average zg 25 5 pc and scale height hg 56 6 pc we propose a method of excluding background stars from the samples which are located at large heights with respect to the symmetry plane of the gould belt we discovered that the expansion effect for the entire star system kg 6 1 km s 1 kpc 1 is determined mainly by the dynamics of the scorpius centaurus association we show that the angular velocity of the residual intrinsic rotation of the gould belt can reac g 6 9 0 2 km s 1 kpc 1 and that this rotation is opposite to the galactic rotation 0 1 introduction the gould belt is a giant stellar gaseous complex closest to the sun efremov 1989 frogel and stothers 1977 olano 2001 po ppel 1997 torra et al 2000 a giant neutral hydrogen cloud called the lindblad ring lindblad 1967 is associated with it and hosts a large group of nearby ob associations de zeeuw et al 1999 massive and low mass stars torra et al 2000 young open star clusters bobylev 2006 piskunov et al 2006 as well as complexes of dust and molecular clouds dame et al 1987 perrot and grenier 2003 schlafly et al 2014 the second data release of the gaia space experiment was published in 2018 brown et al 2018 lindegren et al 2018 the gaia dr 2 catalog contains trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions of about 1 3 billion stars these values were derived based on orbital observations carried out over the course of 22 months the average error of determining the trigonometric parallax and both proper motion components in this catalog depends of the stellar magnitude for bright stars g 15 m parallax errors lie in an interval of 0 02 0 04 mas whereas for faint stars g 20 m they reach 0 7 mas radial velocities for more than 7 million stars of f g k spectral types are determined with an average error of about 1 km s 1 it is impossible to reliably classify stars based only on the gaia dr 2 catalog data how ever it can be done if these data are supplemented with other photometric and spectral surveys marton et al 2019 presently there are publications dedicated to the selection of young gaia dr 2 catalog stars belonging to both the ob associations within the gould belt 1 e mail vbobylev gaoran ru 1 http arxiv org abs 2007 05268 v 1 damiani et al 2019 ortiz leo n et al 2018 and open star clusters cantat gaudin et al 2018 soubiran et al 2018 and the entire gould belt as a whole zari et al 2018 and not only it kounkel and covey 2019 marton et al 2019 in this work we are interested in particular in t tauri type stars since the main spatial and kinematic properties of the gould belt are determined mainly by analyzing massive stars up until recently no large samples of t tauri type stars with reliably measured char acteristics existed based on the hipparcos 1997 catalog data using an example of the closest to the sun scorpius centaurus ob association it has been shown that there are no differences in the distribution and kinematics of high and low mass stars of comparable age bobylev and bajkova 2020 a sartori et al 2003 it would be interesting to confirm the conclusion of these authors for the entire gould belt complex the necessary data on a large sample of t tauri type stars selected from gaiadr 2 have recently been published by zari et al 2018 as was shown by a kinematic analysis of these stars a significant part of the expansion effect typical of the gould belt stars can be explained by the influence of the galactic spiral density wave bobylev 2020 the position parameters found from such stars are in a good agreement with the geometric characteristics of the gould belt determined earlier bobylev 2020 the aim of this work is to study spatial and kinematic characteristics of the gould belt based on the newest data on t tauri type stars we use a sample free of background stars to determine the density distribution parameters in the gould belt and also estimate a series of kinematic parameters using the oort lindblad model 1 the data in this work we use the catalog of zari et al 2018 which contains t tauri type stars selected from the gaiadr 2 catalog by their kinematic and photometric data these stars are located not further than 500 pc from the sun since a limitation of 2 mas was imposed on the sample radius the objects were selected based on their proper motions by analyzing a smoothed distribution of points on the plane cos taking into account the limits of the transverse velocity of the star 4 74 r cos 2 2 40 km s 1 where the distance r is computed from the parallax r 1 the catalog includes three sub samples of t tauri type stars as follows a pms 1 which includes 43 719 stars located inside the most outer contour constructed by smoothing the points on the cos plane and therefore this samples contains the most background objects in comparison with the other two b pms 2 containing 33 985 stars located inside the second contour on the cos plane c pms 3 with 23 686 stars located inside the third contour and therefore they are the most likely members of the kinematic group gould belt as was shown by zari et al 2018 the stars in all the listed samples pms 1 pms 2 and pms 3 have a close spatial connection with the gould belt in this work we consider stars with relative trigonometric parallax errors less than 15 2 2 methods 2 1 coordinate expressions we use cartesian coordinates centered on the sun where the x axis points to the galactic center the y axis is aligned with the direction of galactic rotation and the z axis is directed towards the north pole of the galaxy we then have x r cos l cos b y r sin l cos b and z r sin b the heliocentric distance to the star can be computed using the star s parallax r 1 if is in milliseconds of arc then the distance is in kpc the conversion of equatorial coordinates to galactic was done in accordance with the following expressions sin b cos cos gp cos gp sin sin gp sin l l cos b sin cos gp cos sin gp cos gp cos l l cos b cos sin gp 1 where gp 192 85948 gp 27 12825 are the coordinates of the north galactic pole gp and l 32 93192 is the galactic longitude of the ascending node numerical values for these parameters for the j 2000 0 epoch are recommended by the hipparcos consortium perryman et al 1997 the reverse conversion of galactic coordinates into equatorial is done using the following formulas sin sin b sin gp cos b sin l l cos gp cos gp cos sin b cos gp cos b sin l l sin gp sin gp cos cos b cos l 2 for a correct determination of the quarter of the sought angle one needs all three formulas from both the expression groups 1 and 2 in this work we want to change over to a coordinate system connected with the gould belt symmetry plane which we will denote by a prime symbol for example l or z one may also encounter the need to change back to the standard non prime galactic ordinate system expressions 1 and 2 would allow one to carry out these tasks following bobylev 2020 for the gould belt we use the following coordinates of the gb north pole of its symmetry plane large ring lgb 208 0 bgb 78 0 l 298 0 3 let the initial coordinates of a star be given in the equatorial coordinate system in this case in order to change to the coordinate system connected with the gould belt symmetry plane by using expressions 1 we need to know the equatorial gould belt coordinates which can be computed using formulas 2 gb 179 35316 gb 27 51156 l 269 35316 4 if the initial coordinates of the stars are given in the galactic coordinate system as in the catalog of zari et al 2018 then in order to switch to the coordinates connected with the gould belt symmetry plane one should use l and b together with the pole coordinates 3 instead of and in expressions 1 we will then have l and b in the left hand parts of the equations 3 2 2 exponential density distribution in the case of an exponential density distribution the histogram of the distribution of stars along the z axis is described by the following expression n z n 0 exp z z h 5 where n 0 is the normalization coefficient z the average value computed from the z coordinates of the samples stars which reflects the known fact of the sun being located above the galactic plane h the vertical scale in this work we use expression 5 for the distribution of stars in the gould belt in the coordinate system related to its symmetry plane i e the primed coordinate system 2 3 forming the residual velocities when forming the residual velocities we first of all take into account the peculiar velocity of the sun relative to the local standard of rest u v and w the diameter of the considered region in the vicinity of the sun is 1 kpc and we therefore also need to consider the influence of the differential rotation of the galaxy the expressions used to account for these two effects have the following form vr v r u cos b cos l v cos b sin l w sin b r 0 r r 0 sin l cos b 0 0 5 r 0 r r 0 2 sin l cos b 0 6 vl v l u sin l v cos l r 0 cos b r r 0 r 0 cos l r cos b 0 0 5 r r 0 2 r 0 cos l r cos b 0 7 vb v b u cos l sin b v sin l sin b w cos b r 0 r r 0 sin l sin b 0 0 5 r 0 r r 0 2 sin l sin b 0 8 where the quantities v r v l v b on the right hand side of the equations are the initial uncor rected velocities and vr vl vb in the left hand part are the corrected velocities which we can use to compute the residual velocities u v w based on expressions 10 r is the distance of the star to the rotation axis of the galaxy r 2 r 2 cos 2 b 2 r 0 r cos b cos l r 20 we take the distance r 0 to be equal to 8 0 0 15 kpc camarillo et al 2018 we adopt the specific values of the sun s peculiar velocity from scho nrich et al 2010 u v w 11 1 12 2 7 3 km s 1 we use the following kinematic parameters 0 28 71 0 22 km s 1 kpc 1 0 4 100 0 058 km s 1 kpc 2 and 0 0 736 0 033 km s 1 kpc 3 where 0 is the angular velocity of galactic rotation at distance r 0 and the 0 and 0 parameters are the corresponding derivatives of this angular velocity the values of these parameters were determined by bobylev and bajkova 2019 from an analysis of young open clusters with proper motions parallaxes and radial velocities computed using the gaiadr 2 catalog data the components vr vl and vb are used to compute the spatial velocities u v w where velocity u is directed from the sun to the center of the galaxy v is in the direction of 4 galactic rotation and w points to the north galactic pole u vr cos l cos b vl sin l vb cos l sin b v vr sin l cos b vl cos l vb sin l sin b w vr sin b vb cos b 9 let us estimate the radial velocity errors for our sample in order for them to be comparable with the transverse velocity errors in the gaia dr 2 catalog the average parallax errors for bright stars g 15 m lie in the 0 02 0 04 mas interval and reach 0 7 mas for faint stars g 20 m similarly the proper motion errors range from 0 05 mas yr for bright stars g 15 m to 1 2 mas yr for faint g 20 m stars if we take a proper motion error of 0 1 mas yr then the transverse velocity error at the sample boundary of 0 5 kpc will amount to 4 74 0 5 0 1 0 2 km s 1 and in the limiting case when the proper motion errors are 1 mas yr the transverse velocity error at the sample boundary will be 4 74 0 5 1 2 4 km s 1 thus it is advisable to use the radial velocities of stars with random determination errors less than 2 4 km s 1 2 4 kinematic model from our analysis of the residual velocities vr vl vb we can determine the average group ve locity ug vg wg as well as four oort constant ag bg cg kg g gould belt analogs which in our case characterize the effects of intrinsic rotation ag and bg and expan

system of weights in the form of wr s 0 s 20 2 vr wl s 0 s 20 2 vl and wb s 0 s 20 2 vb where s 0 is the cosmic dispersion vr vl vb are the error dispersions of the corresponding observed velocities the value of s 0 is comparable with the least square error 0 the unit weight error when solving conditional equations in the form 11 13 in this work s 0 ranged from 3 km s 1 to 8 km s 1 we also used the 3 criterion for discarding residual errors when analyzing stars with measured radial velocities we also imposed a restriction on the absolute value of the residual velocity u 2 v 2 w 2 80 km s 1

where in the case of galactic rotation 0 is the angular rotation velocity and v 0 v r is the first derivative of the liner rotation velocity v at point r r 0 for the angular expansion contraction

discussion 3 1 method of eliminating background stars let us first consider one of the three zari et al 2018 catalog samples sample pms 1 which contains the most t tauri type stars fig 1 shows the initial distribution of pms 1 sample stars on a l z plane and also in the adopted l z coordinate system related to the gould belt plane a wave is clearly visible that reflects the fact that the gould belt is tilted relative to the galactic plane it is also evident that the sample contains stars with large heights up to 500 pc 6 figure 2 histogram of the distribution of pms 1 sample stars along the z axis in linear a and logarithmic scales b fig 2 shows the histogram of the distribution of pms 1 sample stars in linear and loga rithmic scales as is evident from the figure despite the considerably patchy distribution of stars on the whole we see a satisfactory agreement with the exponential density distribu tion law the patchiness naturally is caused by a high concentration of stars in the main associations which are closely connected with the gould belt the associations in lacerta l 100 cepheus l 120 cassiopeia l 130 perseus l 160 taurus l 180 orion l 190 vela l 270 and scorpius centaurus l 330 fig 2 b clearly shows the wide wings determined by noise the scale height h for these wings exceeds by a factor of about two the value typical for the vast majority of the remaining stars the histogram was used to find the following exponential distribution parameters 5 zg 25 5 pc hg 56 6 pc n 0 7389 16 for comparison we show in table 1 the results of determining the disk scale h based on the exponential distribution 5 by different authors using various data the table contains values of z related to field stars some authors report zg related to as in our case the gould belt however these values are usually not well determined for example zg 0 2 pc stothers and frogel 1974 zg 15 12 pc elias et al 2006 or zg 7 10 pc gontcharov 2019 comparing the obtained estimate of h 17 with the data in table 1 we can conclude that the distribution of low mass t tauri type stars in the gould belt is very similar to the distribution of massive ob stars let us note the result of gontcharov 2019 who found a rather large scale height of h 170 40 pc for the dust in the gould belt one can say that the gould belt is associated not only with the molecular and dust clouds dame et al 2001 but also with high latitude clouds schlafly et al 2014 bobylev 2016 has shown that a system of close high latitude molecular clouds can be approximated by an ellipsoid with dimensions 350 235 140 pc the size of the third axis of which differs significantly from the one usually adopted for a gould belt ellipsoid 350 250 50 pc thus the dust and gas in the gould 7 figure 3 distribution of the pms 1 sample stars after eliminating the high latitude noise on the l z plane a and projected onto the galactic xy plane b belt are distributed along the z coordinate significantly higher than stars based on the values of z and h in the primed coordinate system we can introduce a limit of z z 3 h thus eliminating the high altitude noise we took z z 200 pc with enough to spare note that with such a limit a strip will remain in fig 1 b parallel to the equator the results are shown in fig 3 where we give the distribution of pms 1 sample stars on the l z plane after noise elimination as well as the distribution of these stars projected onto the galactic xy plane such a method is used it seems for the first time usually when studying gould belt stars the authors separate these stars into two layers equatorial and tilted basically the gould belt elias et al 2006 gontcharov 2019 stothers and frogel 1974 when using our method in the primed coordinate system all objects in the tilted layer are eliminated and a mixed stellar composition remains only in the nodes however due to the fact that our sample contains a huge number of stars concentrated in associations clearly belonging to the gould belt the contribution of the remaining background stars should not affect significantly our determination of the kinematic parameters as is evident from fig 3 b the distribution of stars has a region of reduced density with the center in the second galactic quadrant l 120 at distance r 150 pc this doughnut shaped form is typical for the gould belt de zeeuw et al 1999 perrot and grenier 2003 the giant neutral hydrogen cloud called the lindblad ring has the same shape lindblad 1967 2000 one can also notice a slight condensation of stars located close to the center of this doughnut the per open cluster whose age amounts to about 35 million years 3 2 stellar kinematics to estimate the effects of intrinsic rotation and expansion contraction of the gould belt we solve a system of conditional equations 11 13 using the least squares method we search for a solution for the pms 3 sample which contains the most probable gould belt members free of high altitude noise the results are presented in table 2 which consists of two parts 8 table 1 vertical disk scale h obtained by different authors from young objects in the assumption of an exponential density distribution reference z

to solve the kinematic equations thus for stars with measured radial velocities each star gives all three equations 11 13 the solutions derived only from such stars are given in the upper part of the table the lower part gives solutions obtained in the following way a star with proper motion gives two equations 12 and 13 and if a star has radial velocity it gives all three equations in the first column of table 2 we present the kinematic model parameters the second column step i shows the solution obtained from the velocities of stars that were not cleared of any effects in the third column step ii the sun s peculiar velocity relative to the local standard of rest and the differential rotation of the galaxy were eliminated from the stellar velocities in the fourth column step iii we removed the scorpius centaurus association stars from the sample and in the fifth column step iv the solution was obtained for the sample in the previous step but with new longitudes of the form lnew l lxy when removing the scorpius centaurus association stars from the sample a square with dimensions x 0 200 pc and y 200 0 pc is freed the decision to remove the scorpius centaurus association stars from the sample is based on the paper of bobylev and bajkova 2020 b where the presence of a very strong associ ation expansion coefficient was confirmed k 39 2 km s 1 kpc 1 fig 4 shows the uv velocities of the pms 3 sample stars before and after removing the scorpius centaurus association stars as is clearly seen the distribution of uv velocities for the scorpius centaurus stars is very compact it has a specific form related to the presence of expansion such stars are quite numerous and therefore their removal has a significant effect on the nature of the velocity distribution and the estimated gould belt parameters note that here the uv velocity errors are small at the same time in the considered solar vicinity of 500 pc radius the errors of transverse velocities vl and vb are smaller than those of the radial velocities since here the parallax and proper motion errors for the stars taken from the 9 figure 4 residual velocities for 1845 pms 3 sample stars a the same

velocities rarely exceed 80 km s 1 let us consider the parameters found in step i since we did not introduce any corrections the parameters a and b here describe the rotation of the galaxy and are influenced by the gould belt according to the data in the upper part of table 2 the angular velocity of galactic rotation is 0 b a 30 6 1 2 km s 1 kpc 1 and according to the data in the lower part 0 b a 22 8 0 1 km s 1 kpc 1 for example masers with measured trigonometric parallaxes from the paper of rastorguev et al 2017 were used to derive 0 28 64 0 53 km s 1 kpc 1 for model c 2 a purely circular disk rotation it is notable that the velocities relative to the local standard of rest determined in step ii differ significantly thus based on the data in the upper part of table 2 the stars move with a velocity of 5 72 0 23 km s 1 in the direction l 5 2 and b 12 3 here the vector of this velocity lies practically in the gould belt plane and according to the data in 11 the lower part of the table this velocity is very small and the direction of its vector has a random nature let us consider the solutions given in the last column of table 2 as is evident from the upper part of the table the angular residual rotation velocity g b a 0 2 1 2 km s 1 kpc 1 and the angular expansion velocity k 0 g k c 2 2 1 8 km s 1 kpc 1 do not differ significantly from zero from the solution shown in the lower part of the table we find the angular residual rotation velocity g 6 9 0 2 km s 1 kpc 1 its sign indicates the rotation in the direction opposite to that of the galaxy the angular expansion velocity k 0 g k c here does not differ significantly from zero note that we based our choice of the turn angle lxy and lxy k on which effect was dominant expansion or rotation for example in the upper part of the table for step iv we give the results obtained when turning the coordinate system by angle lxy 37 this value is of interest as it points in the direction 143 323 the center of the doughnut mentioned above i e the geometric gould belt center is located at approximately 140 fig 3 b in the lower part of table 2 step iii does not have this selection problem since both angles are roughly the same as can be seen from equations 11 13 the rotation parameters are best determined from equation 12 which has no sin b for the unknown a b and c and vice versa the expansion contraction parameters k and c are best determined from the radial velocities equation 11 therefore the expansion parameters in the upper part of table 2 are more reliable whereas the rotation parameters are best taken from the lower part of the table parameters b and k of rotation and expansion derived in step ii are in agreement with the results of other authors both in the upper and lower parts of table 2 we have a positive value of k 6 1 km s 1 kpc 1 and a negative b 3 1 km s 1 kpc 1 for instance as torra et al 2000 found from an analysis of ob stars younger than 30 million years and located not further than 0 6 kpc from the sun k 7 1 1 4 km s 1 kpc 1 these authors have not specifically determined ag and bg but obtained for the galactic rotation a 8 5 2 7 km s 1 kpc 1 b 24 5 2 7 km s 1 kpc 1 c 10 5 2 7 km s 1 kpc 1 and k 7 4 2 7 km s 1 kpc 1 here the strong difference of b from 15 km s 1 kpc 1 typical for galactic rotation is interpreted as a presence of a noticeable negative intrinsic rotation of the gould belt and of course no one has previously separated the scorpius centaurus association stars from the gould belt stars 4 conclusions we studied the spatial and kinematic properties of young t tauri type stars from the work of zari et al 2018 the proper motions and parallaxes of such stars were selected from the gaia dr 2 catalog these authors also collected the radial velocities for a small percentage of these stars from the literature the paper of zari et al 2018 describes four ums stellar samples this is a sample of stars in the upper part of the main sequence pms 1 pms 2 and pms 3 selected according to their transverse velocities in this work our main attention was directed at analyzing two samples namely pms 1 and pms 3 the pms 1 sample contains 43 719 t tauri type stars but compared to samples pms 2 and pms 3 it includes the most background objects the pms 3 sample contains 23 686 t tauri type stars which are probable gould belt members according to the principle of their selection 12 we used the pms 1 sample stars to find the following exponential distribution parameters average zg 25 5 pc and scale height hg 56 6 pc we propose using these parameters to eliminate the background stars located at large heights with respect to the gould belt symmetry plane to this end we suggest switching to a primed coordinate system l b x y z connected with the gould belt symmetry plane this approach allows one to eliminate all objects that are tilted relative to the gould belt symmetry plane with the mixed stellar composition remaining only in the nodes using about 1800 stars from the pms 3 sample with measured radial velocities proper motions and parallaxes we found the angular galactic rotation velocity 0 b a 30 6 1 2 km s 1 kpc 1 which is rather close to the known estimates of this quantity we then formed the residual velocities for the pms 3 sample stars free of the sun s peculiar velocity and differential galactic rotation step ii this step shows that the stars move with velocity 5 72 0 23 km s 1 in the direction of l 185 2 and b 12 3 relative to the local standard of rest the velocity vector thus lies practically in the gould belt plane among the other parameters the most noticeable is kg 6 1 km s 1 kpc 1 the so called k effect which describes the expansion contraction of a stellar system in the next stage step iii and step iv we show that the kinematic k effect practically totally disappears when scorpius centaurus association stars are eliminated from the sample the angular velocity of intrinsic residual rotation here is small simultaneously we analyzed the entire pms 3 sample containing more than 23 000 stars with mostly known proper motions and parallaxes about 1800 of these stars have measured radial velocities note that the k effect is present however unlike with the previous sample here we derive in step i the velocity u 10 74 0 04 km s 1 which differs from the one obtained earlier by about 5 km s 1 this influences the determination of the residual motion of the sample with regard to the local standard of rest the oort constant a also differs significantly the last step shows that the residual intrinsic rotation angular velocity of the pms 3 sample amounts to g 6 9 0 2 km s 1 kpc 1 and this rotation is in the opposite direction to galactic rotation acknowledgments the authors are
