engineering sciences ben gurion university of the negev israel abstract the abalonetm photosensor technology u s pat 9 064 678 is a modern scalable technology specifically invented for cost effective mass production robustness and high performance we present the performance of advanced fused silica abalone photosensors developed specifically for the potential extension of the icecube neutrino experiment and stress tested for 120 days the resulting performance makes a significant difference intrinsic gain in the high 108 range total afterpulsing rate of only 5 x 10 3 ions per photoelectron sub nanosecond timing resolution single photon sensitivity and unique radio purity and uv sensitivity thanks to the fused silica components at no additional cost to the assembly process 1 introduction to this day the broad field of large area photon detection has relied on the expensive more than 100 000 m 2 80 year old photomultiplier tube pmt technology while the millimeter sized all silicon devices particularly the geiger mode avalanche photo diodes g apds sipms still remain too expensive for most of large area applications currently around 10 million m 2 our studies have led to the conclusion that the reason why the pmt and similar technologies could never have evolved into a modern and cost effective vacuum technology such as the production of blank compact discs cds 10 m 2 or plasma tv screens 500 m 2 lies precisely in the combination of materials that the pmts hybrid photo diodes hpds and microchannel plate pmts mcp pmts are made of the components comprising those materials intrinsic to their very concepts include glass combined with metals wire feedthroughs brazes spot welds ceramics alkali metal deposition sources heating wires platinum antimony beads microchannel plates photodiodes or silicon photomultipliers this disparate combination of materials inevitably necessitates a daylong static batch mode vacuum processing which precludes any modern continuous line production methods despite some recent advances in these technologies 1 5 they remain subject to this fundamental limitation in contrast the abalone photosensor concept 6 7 has bypassed that critical manufacturing problem through the highly non trivial avoidance of all materials other than glass or a similar dielectric material among the components entering the uninterrupted vacuum production line this glass only concept draws from the fact that unlike metals glass does not release trapped gases from its bulk at the temperatures of interest 8 therefore it does not need a deep bakeout instead it requires only a thorough surface layer scrub the abalone photosensor design comprises only three industrially pre fabricated glass components fig 1 that enter a continuous production line process which starts with standard rapid plasma cleaning followed by a standard rapid ultrapure metal thin film deposition process and ends with hermetic bonding of the three components as the two thin film seals between them are activated 6 9 the abalone photosensor prototypes have been developed and initially produced in the specially constructed abalone prototype pilot production plant a 4 p part of the ferenc lab at uc davis which is in essence a downscaled rudimentary version of a real production line that nevertheless performs all of the processes accurately 6 based on that r d photonlab inc has recently designed and acquired a production oriented facility in order to perform application specific r d and gradually scale up production one of the keys to this technology is our thin film vacuum sealing technique 6 9 it was optimized through several generations of full scale prototypes verifying lasting integrity of any vacuum sealed photosensor is a complex task that can be properly carried out only over a long period and only in a permanent active detection mode the continuous 4 year long test of one of the abalone photosensor prototypes that was left working on the test bench ever since it was assembled in may of 2013 has revealed 10 the afterpulsing rate of positive ions two orders of magnitude lower than in pmts 5 and constantly improving with time the low intrinsic production cost of the abalone photosensors expected to fall below 5 000 m 2 with fully developed production is also accompanied by simple application specific cost effective integration methods 6 7 for example abalone photosensors can be integrated within a tandem detector module that hosts two abalone units oriented in opposite directions 6 or quite differently in thin lightweight self supporting and modular composite abalone panels 7 the tandem module configuration has been specifically developed for the icecube extension project the abalone photosensors are resistant to shock vibration and compression and immune to accidental exposure to strong light including daylight this article focuses on the first stress tests of the new generation of fused silica abalone photosensors specifically developed for the icecube extension project conducted at the extreme voltage and event rate settings one of the prototypes has also been tested for integrity at a temperature of 56 representative of the icecube environment in parallel we have also been developing abalone photosensor panels specifically designed for cryogenic dark matter and double beta decay experiments the results of the various specific designs and optimizations will appear in the forthcoming articles 2 abalone photosensors each photoelectron emerging from the photocathode on the inside surface of the dome see fig 1 is accelerated into the small hole in the center of the base plate which is vacuum sealed by the windowlet from the outside the windowlet scintillator converts the kinetic energy of an accelerated photoelectron into secondary photons proportionally to the kinetic energy and the scintillator yield 11 12 in the currently presented setup a 25 kev photoelectron generates around 650 photons in the lyso scintillator and 100 of those are detected by the sensl j type g apd with an internal gain of 6 1 x 106 so the combined gain is 6 x 108 the breakthrough concept of the two sealing thin films doubling as passes for the high voltage and the ground potential 6 allows the abalone photosensor to function without any through the glass feedthroughs i e without any solid metals among the vacuum processed components the absence of metals and other non glass materials presents the key to the modern abalone technology the electron focusing field within the vacuum enclosure can be formed in different suitable ways depending on the desired integration configuration 6 7 by the shape of the conductor kept at the same potential as the photocathode positioned below the base plate not shown here that conductor assures collection of electrons from the entire photocathode while in its absence the collection efficiency of electrons originating from the bottom 5 10 mm of the dome falls below unity the concentration factor of 10 000 from the photocathode to the bombarded windowlet area minimizes the g apd area and thus the overall cost as well as its capacitance the windowlet can either be entirely made of a suitable scintillator material or as a thin glass plate coated on its vacuum facing surface with a thin scintillator film fig 1 left the abalonetm photosensor schematics right a prototype developed for the icecube extension project the inner diameter of the dome is 10 cm the base plate and the dome are made of fused silica which provides uv sensitivity as well as a unique level of radio purity the abalone technology allows fused silica to be used instead of glass without any additional cost to the assembly process 3 experimental for the abalone prototype discussed in this article we have used a cs 3 sb photocathode while the windowlet was made of lyso scintillator any other bialkali multialkali or similar photocathode materials can be grown in the dome under the controlled conditions within the production system while the cs 3 sb photocathode is most suitable for r d since during the deposition process it spontaneously converges to the optimal stoichiometric configuration 10 13 16 the windowlet is a 6 x 6 x 1 5 mm 3 plate we chose lyso for this study because of its mechanical and chemical robustness scintillators that offer higher yields and faster response than lyso have been studied recently but lyso already provides an acceptable performance for most applications considered so far a dismountable optical coupling of the g apd to the windowlet was established with standard optical grease the presented data were collected exclusively with a 6 x 6 mm 2 sensl j type microfj g apd that comprises m cells the combined gain of the lyso windowlet and the sensl g apd is 6 x 108 for 25 kev photoelectrons a 405 nm led light source was centered axially 25 cm above the prototype and pulsed at a frequency of 66 7 khz we have used a pair of 5 ghz digital lecroy oscilloscopes to collect analyze and plot the data the data presented in this article were collected exclusively during a stress test run conducted at the acceleration potential fixed to the highest practical setting 25 kv and at the highest recommended bias for the g apd these extreme conditions are by no means optimal for any practical application 4 waveforms and pulse height spectra the gain of about 6 x 108 guarantees unambiguous detection of single photons possible even with unamplified signals see figs 2 5 approximately 30 40 of electrons scatter back into vacuum from the lyso scintillator after a fraction of their energy has already been converted into secondary photons some of them shortly return into the windowlet for their second detection so their entire energy is eventually recorded the amplitudes of the non returning electrons fall below the single photon peak see fig 3 however most of them are still unambiguously detected thanks to the powerful separation of such events from the pedestal moreover thanks to the low temperature in the icecube environment the dark count contribution will be strongly suppressed and there will be less confusion even in the narrow overlap region in cases of multiple photons per event the combination of fully detected returning and non returning back scattered electrons leads to events that fall between the individual photon peaks see figs 2 5 the probability for back scattering is related to the square of the effective atomic number of the scintillator which for lyso is very high zeff 66 nevertheless thanks to the high gain lyso provides a very good solution for single photon applications see fig 5 some low z scintillators can be used instead fig 2 screenshots of waveform samples taken directly from the oscilloscope without any prior amplification after a 2 m long cable note that the gain is 6 x 108 the trigger is fixed at 1000 ns in the presented time scale fig 3 superimposed waveforms with different contributions indicated no amplification was used before the oscilloscope fig 4 the spectrum of pulse height maxima top sampled in the area preceding the peak green and in the peak area yellow bottom the same but presented in a logarithmic scale no amplification was used before the oscilloscope fig 5 distribution of pulse area no amplification was used before the oscilloscope 5 afterpulsing the presence of residual gas in any photocathode based vacuum photosensor is detrimental because it both leads to the ion feedback afterpulsing noise and it harms the photocathode and other surfaces due to ion impacts and chemical contamination such afterpulses can be seen in fig 3 most of them occurring up to about 200 ns after the main pulse peaks in a more detailed analysis we used again the standard output from the sensl g apd but this time amplified by a zx 60 preamplifier for better pulse shaping in addition the signal was up scaled from 8 to 10 bit resolution using oscilloscope s own fir interpolation routine on their way from the photocathode to the windowlet a fraction of photoelectrons ionize a neutral atom or a molecule each generated ion is then accelerated towards the photocathode where secondary electrons emerge upon its impact their detection leads to the afterpulse i e the stop signal used in the ion time of flight tof measurement while the start signal corresponds to the initial photoelectron s see fig 6 the resulting spectrum of the measured tof values is shown in fig 7 the dominant contribution of the tof spectrum is from helium while the contributions of the ions of carbon nitrogen and oxygen are very weak and fused together the spectra of pulse height maxima for both the photoelectron pulses and the afterpulses are shown in fig 8 in the selection of events for the tof analysis we applied the same threshold on both pulses equal to one quarter of the one photon peak value the afterpulses of a single electron amplitude form a prominent peak that seems anomalously high compared to the rest of the spectrum indeed apart from the true afterpulses this spectrum comprises accidental coincidences involving thermionic electrons which in the tof spectrum fig 7 correspond to the flat background corrected for this effect the afterpulsing rate is 5 2 x 10 3 ions per photoelectron which is consistent with the previous measurements of one of the first generation prototypes 10 the afterpulsing rate in abalone photosensors is approximately two orders of magnitude lower than in pmts of a similar size as elaborated in ref 10 that is both because of the exceptional cleanliness of the abalone technology and when it comes to the unavoidable and irreducible helium presence by the two orders of magnitude lower ionization energy loss rate in the residual gas thanks to the proportionally higher kinetic energy of electrons in an abalone photosensor 10 17 fig 6 a typical example of a pulse followed by an afterpulse the pulse timing has been determined by constant fraction discrimination at 25 of the pulse maximum the time of flight of the ion that has caused this afterpulse most likely a he ion is the difference between the times of the two pulses fig 7 the spectrum of the time of flight measurements helium is the only gas that penetrates glass and that can be neither chemisorbed nor permanently implanted it is therefore the dominant residual gas component in the vacua of abalone photosensors the vertical dashed line indicates the maximum possible tof of a he ion fig 8 spectra of pulse height maxima for the photoelectron pulses top and for the afterpulses bottom each of the following abalone design features plays an important role a the low base pressure of 10 11 torr in the production system b the absence of outgassing sources such as metals ceramics feedthroughs microchannel plates or silicon diodes c the complete absence of electron multiplication and thus electron induced desorption within the vacuum d the integrity of the two thin film alloy seals e minimum area open geometry and high molecular conductivity all necessary for effective pumping the following three internal vacuum pumping mechanisms keep further improving the vacuum quality in the abalone photosensors over the lifetime i chemisorption on the multi functional chemically reactive thin film getter that covers about 90 of the base plate surface ii ion implantation in glass behind the photocathode 10 18 19 and iii physisorption on all passive surfaces none of which suffers from electron bombardment 6 timing resolution and dark current the waveforms shown in fig 9 were sampled from the fast readout of the sensl g apd the signal was attenuated by 3 db and then amplified by a fast ortec vt 120 c preamplifier total amplification of 14 1 at the entry to the oscilloscope after passing through a 2 m long 50 sma cable thanks to the high gain of the abalone phosotsensor all pulses rise sharply despite the 42 ns long decay time of the lyso scintillator simple constant fraction discrimination at 5 of the peak height provides a time distribution in fig 10 with a width of 740 ps fwhm this width presents an upper limit on the actual timing resolution for a number of reasons starting with the cable length and the simplistic time discrimination furthermore we have used an ordinary led pulser whose own jitter roughly estimated as 500 ps is commensurate with the observed effect indeed according to numerical simulations the maximum span of the times of flight of photoelectrons under the studied conditions is between 2 3 ns and 1 5 ns for photoelectrons originating from the middle and the periphery of the dome respectively the projective geometry of the conical light beam formed by the point like led pulser positioned 2 5 dome diameters in front of the dome restricts that interval further to about 2 3 1 8 ns i e to an effective fwhm resolution of around 250 ps the measured time resolution of 740 ps fwhm is thus consistent with all of the contributing effects and further optimization can provide even a significantly better result the dark current measurement leads to 0 2 fa cm 2 at 25 kv which is lower than the 1 fa cm 2 expected for the relatively noisy cs 3 sb photocathode 16 as expected lower dark currents were found at lower acceleration potentials and lower temperatures the dependence and optimization of the photon detection efficiency dark current and other performance parameters on the acceleration potential g apd bias area and implementation as well as the temperature will be discussed in the forthcoming articles fig 9 a sample of superimposed triggered waveforms the sharp rise of the signals within about one nanosecond is further analyzed in fig 10 fig 10 distribution of pulse times obtained by constant fraction timing analysis of fast pulses the width of 740 ps fwhm includes the genuine timing resolution and instrumental effects such as the led pulser jitter 7 summary the presented data were collected during the 120 day long stress test of the advanced fused silica abalone phosotesnsor prototypes specifically designed for the potential large extension of the icecube cosmic neutrino experiment at the antarctica in general abalone photosensors present a promising solution for all application
