leicester university road leicester le 1 7 rh uk abstract we report on results of an observing campaign to support the juno mission at the beginning of 2016 using texes texas echelon cross dispersed echelle spectrograph mounted on the nasa infrared telescope facility irtf we obtained data cubes of jupiter in the 1930 1943 cm 1 spectral ranges around 5 m which probe the atmosphere in the 1 4 bar region with a spectral resolution of 0 15 cm 1 and an angular resolution of 1 4 this dataset is analysed by a code that combines a line by line radiative transfer model with a non linear optimal estimation inversion method the inversion retrieves the vertical abundance profiles of nh 3 which is the main contributor at these wavelengths with a maximum sensitivity at 1 3 bar as well as the cloud transmittance this retrieval is performed on more than one thousand pixels of our data cubes producing maps of the disk where all the major belts are visible we present our retrieved nh 3 abundance maps which can be compared with the distribution observed by juno s mwr bolton et al 2017 li et al 2017 in the 2 bar region and discuss their significance for the understanding of jupiter s atmospheric dynamics we are able to show important latitudinal variations such as in the north equatorial belt neb where the nh 3 abundance is observed to drop down to 60 ppmv at 2 bar as well as longitudinal variability in the zones we find the nh 3 abundance to increase with depth from 100 15 ppmv at 1 bar to 500 30 ppmv at 3 bar we also display the cloud transmittance nh 3 abundance relationship and find different behaviour for the neb the other belts and the zones using a simple cloud model lacis and hansen 1974 ackerman and marley 2001 we are able to fit this relationship at least in the neb including either nh 3 ice or nh 4 sh particles with sizes between 10 and 100 m 1 introduction ammonia nh 3 is an important molecule for the un derstanding of jupiter s atmosphere indeed the most commonly accepted models of jupiter s atmosphere such as from atreya et al 1999 show that the condensation of nh 3 plays a major role in the presumed cloud structure of jupiter it is assumed to react with hydrogen sulfide h 2 s to form an ammonium hydrosulfide nh 4 sh cloud at around 2 bar and to condense to form a nh 3 ice cloud at about 0 8 bar observations made at radio wavelengths by de pater 1986 de pater et al 2016 for example are consistent with this model the nh 3 abundance profile is found to sharply decrease above the 0 6 bar and 2 bar pressure lev els with variations between the north equatorial belt neb and the equatorial zone ez where the hypo thetical clouds are predicted to lie while the abundance remains constant below the 2 bar pressure level in

et al 2001 be zard et al 2002 bjoraker et al 2015 fletcher et al 2016 have demonstrated that hotspots are not representative of the whole atmosphere more recently the first published results of the juno microwave radiometer mwr bolton et al 2017 li et al 2017 undeniably show that the distribution of nh 3 below the 1 bar pressure level is much more complex than previously thought with strong variations observed both with altitude and with latitude though this complex ity was previously observed above the 1 bar pressure level from 10 m observations achterberg et al 2006 fletcher et al 2016 most strikingly mwr profiles display a minimum with altitude at about 7 bar everywhere on the planet except in the ez in addition orton et al 2017 have highlighted a potential inconsistency at some lati tudes between jiram radiance at 5 m and mwr bright ness temperature that has yet to be understood moreover mwr currently published results may not be representa tive of the whole planet indeed mwr channels have a full width half maximum fwhm footprint from 2 at the equator to 20 near the poles so even if mwr data cover latitudes pole to pole only a narrow longitude range is explored during each perijove pass ammonia could also play a role in the visible light ap pearance of jupiter itself correlated with the vertical and horizontal winds in the troposphere the nh 3 ice clouds could be responsible for the white color of jupiter s zones in the visible and are associated with intense vertical up drafts bringing nh 3 to high altitudes owen and terrile 1981 however this relation between nh 3 and the visi ble brightness of jupiter has been tempered by the work of giles et al 2015 which showed that pure nh 3 ice clouds are not consistent with cassini vims 5 m data these results are in agreement with baines et al 2002 observa tions using the galileo near infrared mapping spectrom eter nims which showed that pure nh 3 ice clouds have bee identified on less than 1 of the area observed in the study in the same work to explain this discrepancy be tween the observations and thermodynamic predictions it was suggested that nh 3 ice material might be altered either by photochemistry or coated by another material the brown color of the belts may be due to a deeper cloud deck possibly containing a sulfide like nh 4 sh as evoked by owen and terrile 1981 the color of the great red spot grs might be due to nh 3 photodissociation byproducts reacting with acetylene c 2 h 2 at high alti tude carlson et al 2016 or irradiation of nh 4 sh par ticle loeffler and hudson 2018 in all cases nh 3 seems to play a role in the cloud formation and therefore the colors in visible light of jupiter joint cloud opacity and nh 3 gas abundance measurement could therefore be useful to assess the importance of this role 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 x px 0 20 40 60 80 y px 75 7 0 65 60 55 50 45 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 180 210 240 270 300 0 0 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 2

25 west and stepped by 0 7 increments east until the slit fell off the planet on the eastern limb sky observations taken at the beginning and end of the scan were used to subtract the sky emission throughout the scan the observations were flat fielded and flux calibrated using observations of a blackbody card placed in front of the instrument win dow at the beginning of the observations

see section 3 3 reduction is performed within the texes pipeline soft ware along with wavelength calibration by using telluric lines within the bandpass observed and distortion correc tions for all the optical effects within the spectrograph to return a fully reduced flux calibrated 3 dimensional data cube 2 d spatial and 1 d spectral then the latitude and longitude of each pixel are determined this is discussed in section 2 2 the spectral cubes were transposed to make them look like the disk as observed from earth as shown for example in figure 2 they cover the planet s disk in roughly 65 95 pixels depending on the cube with a pixel projected an gular resolution of 0 7 the length of the scan steps along the x axis and 0 34 along the y axis close to the diffraction limit of the telescope with a spectral resolu tion of 0 15 cm 1 in the 1930 1943 cm 1 spectral range this range permits us to probe the atmosphere in the 1 3 bar region via the strong nh 3 line at 1939 cm 1 as shown later the noise of the observed radiance at each wavenumber was taken as the mean of the standard deviation of the radiance of the off disk pixels in the four 5 5 pixels squares at each corner of the spectral cubes this gives us a mean s n ratio per spectral pixel of 10 with a maximum of 35 more details about the spectral cubes can be found in table 1 it should be noted that there is known radiance cali bration problems with texes as highlighted by fletcher et al 2016 and melin et al 2017 this may affect the absolute values essentially of the cloud transmittance but not the relative spatial variations that we observe 2 1 2 visible light in order to compare our infrared observations with the visible aspect of jupiter we took a cylindrical map of jupiter made by einaga 2016 from a mosaic of pic tures taken between 15 and 16 january 2016 with a 300 mm newton telescope and transformed it using molleweide and orthographic projections the results are displayed in figures 1 and 3 2 2 latitudes and longitudes after the pipeline processing the data are pushed through a purpose built idl program where the user visibly matches the limb of the planet to an ellipse to locate the center of the planet then using naif s icy toolkit acton 1996 the program calculates the latitude and longitude of each pixel of the map in jovian west longitude and planetocen tric latitude one of the main challenges of using this method is that with texes in the spectral range of our observations the limbs are not well defined it is therefore hard to correctly place the ellipse a few arc seconds error on the placement of the center of the ellipse resulting on a few degrees error on latitudes and longitudes at the center of the disk or the size of the ellipse can result in errors reaching 4 more than 10 on latitude and longitude near the limbs this makes quantitative spatial comparisons between our work and others difficult hence when spatially compar ing our results with other works we favour a qualitative discussion 2 3 doppler shift we corrected the doppler shift of the observed spectra using a velocity map produced by the idl mapping code which takes into account the relative velocity of jupiter with respect to earth as well as jupiter s rotation so that each spectrum has its own doppler shift correction to take this into account when adding the effect of the sky to the synthetic spectra see section 3 2 the sky is accord ingly shifted in wavenumber for information the doppler shift had a mean value of 0 17 cm 1 3 methods 3 1 radiative transfer the radiative transfer we use includes h 2 h 2 and h 2 he absorption rovibrational bands from ch 4 h 2 o and nh 3 as well as cloud induced absorption reflection and emission the h 2 h 2 and h 2 he absorption were given by a subroutine originally written by a borysow and based on models by borysow et al 1985 1988 the volume mixing ratios vmr line parameters i e position in tensity and energy of the lower transition level tempera ture and broadening coefficients references used for mod elling these different gases are listed in table 2 we used linewidths broadened by h 2 and he and their respective temperature dependence whenever available for the line shape we used a voigt profile with a cut off at 35 cm 1 for all the molecules our initial a priori temperature profile comes from the measurement of the galileo probe seiff et al 1998 our model atmosphere is divided up in 126 atmospheric layers from 10 7 to 20 bar evenly distributed logarithmically our model includes one monolayer grey i e spectrally constant cloud located at 0 8 bar with a lambertian re flectance i f always equal to 0 15 this cloud is repre sented in our code by a scalar fixed to 1 above the cloud level and the cloud transmittance tc at and below the cloud level this cloud model is inspired from the work of giles et al 2015 2017 who showed that the tropo spheric cloud layer can be located between 1 2 and 0 8 bar and that more refined cloud structures as described by atreya et al 1999 for example three multilayer clouds with a smooth transmittance gradient have only a minor effect on the goodness of fit for the spectral directional reflectance we used the value retrieved by drossart et al 1998 based on a comparison between 5 m low flux day side and nightside spectra of jupiter however we do not include multiple diffusion or a deep cloud layer at 5 bar these parameters play an important role only inside the zones see giles et al 2015 for example but in our data the mean signal to noise ratio of these regions is system atically lower than 6 which is not high enough to retrieve valuable information therefore our approach ignoring these parameters should have only a minor impact on our results the radiance is convolved to simulate the instrument function which was approximated as a gaussian with a fwhm of 0 15 cm 1 further details concerning the radiative transfer equa tions used can be found in the appendix 3 2 transmission of the earth s atmosphere to model the effect of earth s atmospheric transmit tance sky we used the code lblrtm clough et al 2005 using a u s standard atmosphere and zenith an gles and integrated column for telluric h 2 o adjusted to reproduce the conditions of observation for each spectral cube then we multiplied our synthetic spectra and our retrieval derivatives see section 3 3 by the synthetic sky transmittances in contrast with methods adopted by pre vious authors where the observed radiance is divided by the sky transmittances i e be zard et al 2002 there is no need to remove some spectral ranges where the sky ab sorption is above an arbitrary limit concomitantly the retrieval process is less sensitive to the radiances at the wavenumbers where the sky absorption is high we determined the zenith angles using the position and altitude of the telescope and the position of jupiter in the sky at the date of observation coupled with ephemerides the value of the telluric h 2 o column was derived for each cube using the jovian spectra with highest signal we obtained the best fit with the synthetic spectrum gen erated with the line of sight column for telluric h 2 o dis played in table 1 3 3 retrieval method we used a classical optimal non linear retrieval method rodgers 2000 to retrieve the abundance of the main molecular contributors at each atmospheric layer as well as the cloud transmittance while the abundance profiles of minor species as well as the temperature profile were kept constant this retrieval method can be described as follows we can take the full state vector x containing k independent components x 1 xk representing in our case the abun dance profiles and the cloud transmittance profile it can be demonstrated rodgers 2000 eq 4 29 that the best estimator x j of a component xj of x can be written as x j xaj sajk t j i k i 1 kisaik t i s 1 y 1 with xaj the a priori estimate of xj i e the a priori

smoothing applied to the solution this matrix is then weighted by a factor j w trace s trace kjs ak t j w being the weight of the constraint on the departure from the a priori profile in this study we adopted v 0 75 and w 0 1 these values give us a fair goodness of fit and convergence speed while preventing the abundance profile to oscillate note that for w a wide range of values is possible from 1 to 0 05 most of the time without significant changes in the results if w is taken too low or too high the results might vary with the chosen a priori finally the covariance matrix saj for the a priori parameter xaj is given by saj js a 3 our algorithm follows these steps i we calculate the radiance ya and its derivatives k using our a priori pro files xa ii we estimate the goodness of fit of the mod elled radiance ya on the observed radiance y through the weighted sum of squared deviations per degrees of freedom reduced 2 function iii we use our retrieval method described in eq 1 this gives us our new profiles x iv we update our a priori profiles with our new profiles so that xa x these four steps constitute one iteration while the goodness of fit calculated in step 2 is improved by more than a threshold we continue to iterate until the condition is fulfilled for our runs we choose a of 1 typically it takes about 10 iterations before the 2 improvement drops below this threshold we also limited the maximum number of iterations to 32 to speed up our retrievals increasing the maximum number of iterations does not significantly change our results this limit was reached in less than 0 001 of the retrievals and concerned mostly pixels with high cloud transmittance 0 129 in the worst case the 2 was improved by 1 during the last iteration we consider that given the low improvement of the goodness of fit at the last iteration and the very lim ited number of spectra concerned this limit in iteration number had no significant effect on our results to prevent the retrieval of being trapped within a 2 local minima we chose to make a first run retrieving only the cloud transmittance while leaving the mixing ratios of the gases constant in this case we used a weight w 0 5 to ensure a fast convergence this permitted us to have an a priori value on the cloud transmittance for our second run very close to the solution value in the second run we retrieved all the abundance profiles as well as the cloud transmittance it is this last run that gives us the spectra profiles and maps that will be discussed in the following sections clouds play a crucial role in our retrieval method be cause of the way clouds are taken into account see the appendix they can change drastically the sensitivity and therefore the retrieved profiles of our species indeed the pressure level at which they are placed and the spectral directional reflectance value are critical for example the cloud free maximum sensitivity at 5 m of most of the species we study in this work is around 4 bar if we add a cloud the sensitivity at all the levels below the cloud level decreases due to its transmittance while the sensitivity at and above the cloud level increases due to the solar re flected contribution at some point the level of maximum of sensitivity at a given wavenumber will switch from be low the cloud level to above the cloud level for nh 3 the effect is important even at a relatively high cloud trans mittance of 0 1 the result is that taking into account the effect of the smoothing matrix sa the maximum change in the retrieved abundance profile will be situated at lower pressure than in a cloud free atmosphere typically in the 1 3 bar range instead of the 3 4 bar expected for nh 3 we tested four configurations a b c and d in order to test the influence of the a priori and the classical view of a profile constant below a given altitude a in the first configuration we used the abundance pro file from sromovsky et al 1998 modified with a vmr of 200 ppmv for pressures greater than 0 8 bar to represent 6 the classical view on the abundance but with a value at 10 bar close to what was found by li et al 2017 b in the second configuration the a priori vmr was set to 300 ppmv for pressures greater than 0 8 bar which is the value found by sromovsky et al 1998 c in the third configuration the a priori vmr was set to 400 ppmv for pressures greater than 0 8 bar to have an a priori similar to the one used by li et al 2017 d in the fourth con figuration we used the same a priori as in configuration b but instead of allowing the profile to freely vary at each iteration we impose that the profile must be constant at pressures greater than 2 bars and at pressures comprised between 0 8 and 2 bars taking as value the last retrieved vmr at 2 bars the formulae of knh 3 and sa nh 3 are changed accordingly this latter configuration represents a case where the nh 3 vmr is constant until its conden sation at 0 8 bar an example of a retrieval using these profiles is discussed in section 4 3 the results are displayed on figures 9 and 12 in the 1930 1943 cm 1 spectral range only h 2 o and to a lesser extent ch 4 and ph 3 play a significant role apart from nh 3 in this spectral range h 2 o plays a role similar to the cloud transmittance and retrieving its abun dance profile following our methodology does not lead to significant improvement hence we chose to not retrieve the h 2 o abundance profile since we also assume the ch 4 vmr abundance profile to be constant we chose to invert only the abundance profile of nh 3 while the abundance profiles of the other molecules were kept constant 3 4 error handling the uncertainties on the parameters obtained by the retrieval method are given by the square root of the diag onal elements of the covariance matrix s j saj gjkjsaj gjf 4 with gj sajk t j ikisaik t i s 1 the gain matrix and f being 0 except on its diagonal where fii yi meaning no correlation between wavenumber the first two terms represent the result of the sum of the smoothing error and the retrieval noise error i e the propagation of the instrumental noise into the retrieved parameters the last term represents the forward model error which is due to the model imperfections note that the forward model error must be evaluated with the true parameters rather than the retrieved parameters however at the end of all the iterations the retrieved parameters are expected to be close to the true state therefore the value used here should be a good approximation of the true forward model error 4 results and discussion 4 1 goodness of fit to calculate the goodness of fit of our retrievals we used the classical reduced rms method 2 n where n is table 3 goodness of fit for each configuration for all the retrieved spectra configuration nh 3

iteration n pressures greater than 1 8 bar and between 0 8 and 1 8 bar set to the abundance value at 1 8 bar retrieved at iteration n 1 the number of free parameters i e the number of samples in a spectrum we obtained very similar goodness of fit for all our configurations as shown in table 3 configu rations a b and c allow the nh 3 vmr profile to vary freely hence the vmr profiles retrieved with these config urations can be difficult to physically explain in contrast the explanation for vmr profiles retrieved with configura tion is straightforward there is no source of nh 3 and the gas condenses into nh 3 ice clouds at 0 8 bar more other the goodness of fit obtained with this configuration is com parable to those of the other configurations therefore we will discuss only the results derived from configuration d a map of these rms can be seen in figure 6 for configu ration d we obtained a mean 2 n of 1 9 with a standard deviation of 1 3 and values lower than 4 for 95 of the retrieved spectra there is a large correlation between the mean radiance and the goodness of fit due to the better snr in high flux spectra a comparison between a synthetic spectrum and an observed spectrum is displayed in figure 7 these relatively high 2 n values are primarily ex plained by the presence in the majority of our observations of spikes and dips at roughly constant wavenumbers of varying intensities and shapes that we were unable to fit there are some in figure 7 at 1933 6 1934 9 1937 0 or 1939 9 cm 1 we cannot definitively attribute those features to a specific instrument artifact since its seems that the features follow jupiter s band structure but we strongly favour this explanation for the following reasons i in the spectra where these features seem insignificant we are able to obtain reasonably good fits 2 n 1 ii our model was tested and validated on a spectrum of jupiter in the same spectral range already analysed in be zard et al 2002 so our model should not be the main issue iii these features do not correspond to lines of any simple constituent though some of them seem to be corre lated with the telluric absorption iv previous works on texes in the same spectral range such as fletcher et al 2016 did not mention such issues our uncertainties take into account the capacity of our 7 85 s 80 s 75 s 70 s 65 s 60 s 55 s 50 s 45 s 40 s 35 s 30 s 25 s 20 s

all our reduced spectral cube in the 1930 1943 cm 1 wavenumber range configuration a longitudes are in system iii model to fit the data and the nh 3 abundance of the re gions exempt of those features is consistent with the re gions where they are more intense so we stay confident in our results 4 2 cloud transmittance it should be kept in mind that our methodology as sumes that the main modulator of flux is cloud transmit tance rather than absorption by gases therefore it is not surprising that our retrieved cloud transmittances are strongly correlated with the mean radiance map once again the results are very similar among configuration a b c and d so we will discuss only configuration d it can be seen from figure 8 that the zones are very cloudy contrary to the belts the northern belts are or ganised in patches of relatively cloud free regions which correspond to dark bluish regions south of the belts at the interface with the white zones the so called hotspots it can also be seen that the globally thinnest cloud patches are located in the north equatorial belt neb with a cloud transmittance greater than 0 2 the region at 315 w in the neb is a good example it should be noted that the whitest regions of the northern belts in the visible image figure 3 often correspond to the regions with the thickest clouds this can be seen for example near 240 w in the neb or near 210 w in the north temperate belt ntb in the south equatorial belt seb the great red spot grs situated at longitude 240 w seems to per turb a line of thin clouds in the visible c f figure 3 the dark brown line between 15 and 20 s from its east side so that the entire band west of the grs is covered by thick light brown clouds that get more and more trans parent westward this feature has been observed for ex ample by giles et al 2015 with 2001 cassini s vims spectral cubes it can be explained by turbulence caused by the grs forming clouds south west of the grs there is another line of thinner clouds at 20 s between 240 and 270 w which correspond to a dark bluish region in the visible image this region seems to circle around the grs similarly to the dark line east of the grs still in the seb between longitude 120 w and 150 w it seems that there are two dark brown transparency filaments one at the north and one at the south of the belt separated by a thin line of white thicker clouds the southern one reaches the grs while the clouds of the northern one get thicker approaching the grs in the south temperate belt stb the distribution seems to be simpler the clouds get thinner at the center of the belt and thicker at its borders the white ovals that can be seen in the visible at latitude 40 s do not seem to have an infrared cloud counterpart but it might be because we do not have a high enough spatial resolution quantitatively these results are consistent with cloud opacities at 5 m retrieved in other works such as be zard 9 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 nh 3 volume mixing

find transmittances between 0 20 and 0 30 at 2 bar in bright regions of the atmosphere it is also consistent with precise cloud re trievals such as by wong et al 2004 who found that a compact grey cloud of transmittance 0 14 is needed to fit their observation in the neb 4 3 nh 3 the jupiter spectra we have can be separated into two groups one group is constituted of high flux high snr spectra which gives a reasonably low relative uncertainty on the retrieved nh 3 abundance the other group in con trast is constituted of low flux low snr spectra which gives a high uncertainty on the retrieved nh 3 abundance one way to separate these groups is to use the retrieved cloud transmittance indeed the retrieved cloud transmit tance is highly correlated with the mean radiance and therefore the flux of the spectra and is easy to ma nipulate if we set a cloud transmittance threshold of 0 05 to separate the two groups it appears that all the spectra below this threshold have a low snr 4 or less and are located exclusively in the zones hence for now we will refer as zones all the points with a retrieved cloud transmittance lower than 0 05 and as belts all the other points 4 3 1 belts an example of an abundance profile retrieved by each configuration is displayed in figure 9 we used the same spectrum as for figure 7 in this figure 9 we can see that we obtain very similar results in the 1 3 bar region where our maximum of sensitivity lies with all our configu rations while anywhere else the results are very a priori dependent and therefore not meaningful still in this fig ure we also show the profiles retrieved using an a priori close to that retrieved by mwr bolton et al 2017 inside of the neb and an a priori with an abundance set to 50 ppmv below 0 6 bar the solution profiles are close to the other ones in the 1 3 bar range and confirms that outside of this sensitivity region no reliable information is avail able we will therefore hereafter only show the retrievals for configuration d figures 10 and 11 in figure 10 we removed all the points in the zones the mean uncertainty on the nh 3 vmr at 2 bar outside of the zones is 20 in this figure we observe a large depletion of nh 3 in the middle of the neb with a volume mixing ratio at 2 bar lower than 200 ppmv and going down to 60 ppmv between planetocentric latitudes 0 17 n over all our longitude coverage system iii 90 360 w this depletion seems to be less significant at longitudes 225 240 w where thicker clouds are present the stb and the seb are enriched compared to the neb 250 ppmv and correspond to darker regions in the visible the ntb is similarly enriched except between 270 300 w where the nh 3 abundance is lower than 200 ppmv globally the southern belts seem to be have a decreasing nh 3 abundance southward from 250 ppmv north of the belts to 200 ppmv south of the belts while it is the opposite for the ntb in the seb the nh 3 abundance seems to be lower around the grs at 17 s 230 w 200 ppmv than in most of the belt 300 ppmv a filament of depleted nh 3 appears north of the seb east of longitude 150 w correlated to the filament of thinner cloud observed in figure 8 westward of the grs the nh 3 abundance seems to decreases with longitude poleward of latitudes 45 n there seems to be a de creasing nh 3 abundance towards the pole starting at 240 ppmv and going down to 160 ppmv we have only a few points poleward of latitude 50 s but the behaviour seems to resemble what we observed in the northern hemi sphere globally the nh 3 abundance shows little variation with longitude in the temperate belts or near the poles but the smallest features like the ovals may not be resolved in the seb the grs seems to have a major influence sep arating two very distinct behaviours we discussed earlier in the neb the latitudinal width of the depletion seems to vary with longitude 5 wide at longitudes 150 w 200 w 270 w almost disappearing at 235 w while nearly 10 wide in most of the belt strong longitudinal variations should be observed by mwr in the equatorial belts as it probes differents over different perijoves 10 85 s 80 s 75 s 70 s 65 s 60 s 55 s 50 s 45 s 40

close to what was retrieved by mwr in the ez in figure 11 we show the nh 3 mole fraction at 2 bar and the cloud transmittance longitudinally averaged over 1 latitude bins and compare them with mwr retrieval bolton et al 2017 as expected there is a huge un certainty on our results in the zones and the mean abun dance retrieved here should be taken cautiously we also observe the same north south nh 3 abundance slope in the belts at the exception of the neb and poleward of latitude 45 that we observed in figure 10 the neb de pletion is also clearly visible globally we obtain a mean nh 3 abundance close to what was found by mwr but we do not see evidence of the plume detected by mwr in the ez this discrepancy can be explained both by our latitude uncertainty discussed in section 2 2 which can reach 5 at the equator and by our abundance uncer tainties in this region which is greater than 300 ppmv in summary our results are in good agreement with mwr measurements our values of nh 3 vmr in the neb are also consistent with the preliminary retrieval from jiram observations north of two hotspots grassi et al 2017 4 3 2 zones as mentioned above in this section the results we ob tain in the zones are much less reliable than in the belts due to the low snr of the spectra in these regions in an attempt to enhance the snr of the zones we averaged all the spectra in these regions as well as their corresponding doppler shift and noise doing this allows us in first approximation to divide the noise by the square root of the number of spectra averaged however this ap proach has some limits for example the doppler shift the viewing angle the solar incidence angle vary with the spectra while the telluric absorption varies with the spec tral cube and these may not be well taken into account in the averaging hence the results we obtain by this methodology should be taken particularly cautiously with the above mentioned methodology we obtained two spectra i in the first one we averaged all the spectra in the zones ii while in the second one we averaged the spectra located in the zones between latitudes 15 s and 5 n corresponding to the ez in figure 12 we display the retrieved nh 3 abundance profiles of the two spectra for various a priori we can see that our domain of sensitivity remains roughly the same compared to what we obtain in the belts between 1 and 3 bar there is no significant differences between the be haviour of the retrieved profiles for the ez dotted curves and for all the zones considered together solid curves in the 1 3 bar region however the behaviour of the nh 3 abundance profiles is very different from what we obtained in section 4 3 1 figure 9 instead of what can be inter preted as constant with depth abundance profiles in the 1 3 bar range we obtain a nh 3 abundance that seems to increase with depth from 100 ppmv at 1 bar to 500 ppmv at 3 bar this is the opposite of what was found by mwr bolton et al 2017 both in the zones where the nh 3 abundance is observed to decrease with depth from 300 ppmv at 0 7 bar to 200 ppmv at 7 bar and in the ez where the nh 3 abundance is observed to re main constant at 400 ppmv what we obtain is closer to what was obtained in giles et al 2017 with a nh 3 abundance increasing from 10 ppmv at 1 bar to 500 ppmv at 3 bar or from 30 to 90 ppmv depending on the cloud model used these differences in retrieved values could be explained by the absence of light scattering in our model in figure 13 we display our two averaged spectra and two of the fits we obtained we voluntarily removed the 1932 1935 cm 1 region which is dominated by telluric ab sorption we can see that we obtain a relatively good fit given the small noise considered we can also see that the different fits are relatively similar despite their different initial a priori profiles 4 4 nh 3 vmr and cloud transmittance correlation in figure 14 we display the retrieved cloud transmit tance as a function of our retrieved nh 3 abundance at 2 bar for each of our spectra and each of our spectral cubes we decided to classify the spectra into three families rep resented on the figures by different colors i the first family red corresponds to the zones clouds transmit tance 0 05 ii the second family green corresponds to all the spectra outside of the zones with a latitude com prised between 0 and 17 n which correspond to the neb iii the third family blue are all the spectra outside of the zones and neb which corresponds to the other belts the location of these families are displayed in this order 12 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 ra

al 2007 and martonchik et al 1984 and are displayed in table 4 with this relation we are able to fit the observed cor relation with both an nh 3 ice and an nh 4 sh cloud for different sets of our free parameters reff and frain see ta ble 4 these sets of parameters are roughly consistent with the values retrieved by ohno and okuzumi 2017 for example if we take large enough particles we can use the droplet terminal fallspeed equation from ackerman and marley 2001 to calculate the corresponding eddy diffusion coef ficient kzz we obtain values between 105 and 108 cm 2 s 1 depending on the particle size we choose for ei ther nh 3 or nh 4 sh particles the values for 100 m parti cles are of the same order of magnitude as the eddy mixing coefficient expected from free convection as discussed by be zard et al 2002 we can also note that flasar and gierasch 1978 using a model of turbulent convection in a rotating body estimated kzz 4 108 cm 2 s 1 at 10 bar decreasing to 1 108 cm 2 s 1 at 0 5 bar in the neb in good agreement with our finding however the cloud parameters we retrieved may vary for each region for example it is possible that the hotspots may have thinner clouds of smaller particles similar to galileo s probe results ragent et al 1998 particle sizes 10 m while the zones may be covered with thicker clouds of larger particles moreover we have no informa tion about the number of different cloud layers and their respective base pressure or the chemical composition of the clouds more importantly even if our simple model fits relatively well the behaviour of the neb it cannot ex plain the behaviour of the other belts mainly the seb 15 table 4 cloud parameters fitting the observed cloud transmittance nh 3 vmr at 2 bar correlation particle cloud base particle gc 1 1

could be explained by the simplicity of our model and the complexity of the meteorology of the belts or simply by the fact that the nh 3 abundance is roughly constant in the belts and is not correlated with the cloud transmittance in particular the use of a single eddy mixing coefficient to parametrize vertical transport is likely too simplistic as it does not account for vertical advection either upwelling or downwelling nor for hori zontal advection if we assume that nh 3 drives at least partially the clouds on jupiter so if we assume that our model is ad equate but too simple our simplistic model suggests that both nh 3 ice and nh 4 sh are cloud constituents compati ble with our observations but also that local meteorology probably plays a significant in distributing gas and cloud particles 5 conclusions we were able to derive a map of the abundance of nh 3 on jupiter at 2 bar with a spatial resolution of 0 7 and a mean uncertainty of 20 the latitude coverage is 75 s 75 n planetocentric and the longitude coverage is 90 360 w system iii although the information we retrieved in the zones is of questionable quality our results notably show 1 a large nh 3 depletion compared to other regions in the neb with mixing ratio values around 160 ppmv at 2 bar of varying width with longitude 2 a correlation between the most depleted regions in nh 3 of the disk the brightest regions at 5 m the hotspots and the blue gray regions in the neb in visible light 3 an enrichment in nh 3 250 50 ppmv at 2 bar in the other belts compared to the neb with some local exceptions notably in the ntb and around the grs 4 a north to south nh 3 abundance slope in the belts at the exception of the neb with a poleward orien tation 5 a similar north to south nh 3 abundance slope north ward of latitude 45 n and possibly southward of latitude 50 s starting at 240 50 ppmv and going down to 160 30 ppmv 6 in the zones and particularly in the ez our data sug gest a nh 3 abundance increasing with depth from 100 15 ppmv at 1 bar to 500 30 ppmv at 3 bar albeit with a relatively low confidence level 7 a clear distinction in the behaviour of the neb and the other belts in term of nh 3 abundance and cloud transmittance 8 a strong dichotomy in term of cloud transmittance in the seb between the east and the west of the grs the western side seems to be perturbed by the grs and is covered by thicker clouds than the eastern side 9 a possible correlation between cloud transmittance and nh 3 abundance more obvious in the neb than in the other belts 10 according to cloud models the above mentioned cor relation seems to indicate that nh 3 plays a major role in the formation of the cloud we observe at 5 m either through nh 3 ice or nh 4 sh particles however our observations also shows that local me teorology probably play an important role in cloud formation compared with mwr results bolton et al 2017 we obtain on average a similar nh 3 abundance in the 1 3 bar region 250 ppmv and we observe the same depletion in the neb down to 150 30 ppmv at 2 bar the behaviour of nh 3 at pressures greater than 4 bars is inac cessible to us due to the lack of sensitivity of our spectral range to greater pressures we do not observe the plume in the ez and the behaviour of the zones in general seems to be different but the results we obtain in this region
