fisica universita della calabria rende 87036 it 2 university of alabama huntsville huntsville al 35805 usa 3 department of physics and astronomy university of delaware newark de usa abstract a novel technique is presented for describing and visualizing the local topology of the magnetic field using single spacecraft data in the solar wind the approach merges two established techniques the grad shafranov gs reconstruction method which provides a plausible regional two dimensional magnetic field surrounding the spacecraft trajectory and the partial variance of increments pvi technique that identifies coherent magnetic structures such as current sheets when applied to one month of wind magnetic field data at 1 minute resolution we find that the quasi two dimensional turbulence emerges as a sea of magnetic islands and current sheets statistical analysis confirms that current sheets associated with high values of pvi are mostly located between and within the gs magnetic islands corresponding to x points and internal boundaries the method shows great promise for visualizing and analyzing single spacecraft data from missions such as parker solar probe and solar orbiter as well as 1 au space weather monitors such as ace wind and imap keywords solar wind turbulence magnetic fields 1 introduction the structure of the interplanetary magnetic field at inertial range scales of the observed turbulence is of continuing fundamental and practical interest goldstein et al 1995 bruno carbone 2005 mag netic field turbulence influences the propagation of charged particles plasma heating transport of heat and tangling of magnetic field lines matthaeus velli 2011 there are also broader fundamental implica tions for electrodynamics in general and its applica tions in astrophysics and plasma laboratory experi ments given the unique opportunity that interplan etary spacecraft provide for in situ observation it is important to extract as much information as possible from them concerning structural properties directly standard methods of time series analysis and spectral analysis provide only limited information from single spacecraft time series clusters of satellites provide improved information employing multi spacecraft corre lation techniques chhiber et al 2018 including wave corresponding author antonella greco antonella greco fis unical it telescope glassmeier et al 2001 narita et al 2010 and space time ensemble approaches matthaeus et al 2016 here we present an approach for extracting additional structural information based on a few plau sible assumptions and the merger of two established techniques the grad shafranov gs reconstruction method hau sonnerup 1999 hu 2017 which pro vides a plausible regional two dimensional magnetic field topography surrounding the spacecraft trajectory and the partial variance of increments pvi technique greco et al 2009 greco et al 2018 that identifies co herent magnetic structures such as current sheets as potential magnetic flux tube boundaries in this let ter we present a novel combination of these methods providing new insights into the nature of magnetic tur bulence recorded as single spacecraft time series in the super alfve nic solar wind 2 overview and background any magnetic field may be partitioned into flux tubes defined generally as cylinders produced by transport ing a closed contour along the local magnetic field producing a surface everywhere tangent to the field and well defined except at neutral points flux ropes http arxiv org abs 1907 03654 v 1 mailto antonella greco fis unical it 2 pecora et al are flux tubes carrying a current along their magnetic axis magnetic flux ropes are characterized by their spiral magnetic field line configurations and have long been studied in heliophysics in studying the nature of magnetic fields in the solar wind a recurrent and central issue is to describe it in terms of the flux tubes and flux ropes field lines being a degenerate case of flux tubes of zero volume such descriptions account for connectivity as well as constraints on the trans port of particles heat and wave energy the so called spaghetti models are a particular class of observation based flux tube models schatten 1971 bruno et al 1999 borovsky 2008 along boundaries between flux ropes dynamical interactions can produce a concen tration of gradients resulting in structures such as current sheets that are approximated as directional discontinuities greco et al 2009 small scale mag netic flux ropes in the solar wind of durations ranging from a few minutes to a few hours at 1 au have been identified from in situ spacecraft data and studied for decades moldwin et al 1995 2000 feng et al 2008 cartwright moldwin 2010 yu et al 2014 they possess some similar features in magnetic field configu rations to their large scale counterparts the magnetic clouds but unlike clouds which have a clear solar ori gin related to coronal mass ejections the origin of the small scale magnetic flux ropes is still debated our view supported not only by observational analysis but also extensively by numerical simulations over a wide range of scales greco et al 2009 servidio et al 2011 maintains that the presence of small scale magnetic flux ropes or islands is intrinsic to strictly two dimensional 2 d magnetohydrodynamic mhd turbulence small scale flux ropes are believed to be the byproduct of the solar wind turbulence dynamic evolution process result ing in the generation of coherent structures including small random current current cores and cur rent sheets matthaeus montgomery 1980 veltri 1999 greco et al 2009 over the inertial range length scales the 2 d flux tube paradigm can be seen to be relevant to the solar wind due to the well known fact that plasma turbulence with a large scale mean magnetic field tends strongly to evolve towards a quasi 2 d state shebalin et al 1983 matthaeus et al 1990 in fact available observational tests re peatedly have indicated that solar wind turbulence is dominantly quasi two dimensional bieber et al 1996 hamilton et al 2008 macbride et al 2010 narita et al 2010 chen et al 2012 to a reasonable approximation the next step in our reasoning is to recall that mhd turbulence exhibits a variety of relax ation processes taylor 1974 matthaeus montgomery 1980 stribling matthaeus 1991 servidio et al 2008 that tends to minimize or suppress the strength of nonlinearities kraichnan panda 1988 servidio et al 2008 this leads to states that have reduced values of accelerations with a preference in nearly incompressible mhd for attaining approximately force free alfve nic and beltrami states servidio et al 2008 conditions that are realized to some degree in solar wind observa tions osman et al 2011 servidio et al 2012 local relaxation of these types is fast less than a non linear time and leads to turbulence states that are dynamic but in approximate force balance the evolution of such states can be formally slow that is much slower than the time for initial fast relaxation so that quasi static force balance is a reasonable first approximation except at boundaries where coherent structures such as cur rent sheets form servidio et al 2008 between relaxed patches the above conditions quasi two dimension ality and quasi static force balance justify the gs analysis approach employed below while also providing a relatively clean framework for interpretation of the pvi method these methods provide complementary views of the local structure of the turbulent interplane tary magnetic field as we now demonstrate 3 gs and pvi methods reconstruction of 2 d time independent field and plasma structures from data taken by a single spacecraft as it passes through the structures has been frequently used for the analysis and interpretation of space data teh et al 2010 the method employed here the grad shafranov gs reconstruction tech nique is based on the plane

functions of a only the reconstruction technique can be summarized as fol lows the isotropic transverse pressure is computed by using the gse components of magnetic field plasma bulk flow plasma number density and isotropized tem peratures in the interval of interest the structure is supposed to move with a certain velocity the pre ferred co moving frame of reference is the dehoffmann teller frame de hoffmann teller 1950 gosling et al 2011 where the electric field vanishes and the mag flux ropes and current sheets in solar wind 3 netic field remains stationary from the faraday s law indeed the optimal velocity of this reference frame is obtained by minimizing the convection electric field to determine the reconstruction frame minimum variance analysis is performed on the measured magnetic field the x axis of this frame is along the spacecraft tra jectory where the measurements are known and it is perpendicular to the symmetry axis z along the x axis the magnetic vector potential a x 0 is computed by integrating the magnetic field measurements the ana lytic form of the transverse pressure pt a is obtained by fitting the scatter plot pt vs a x 0 with combina tions of polynomials and exponentials at this point the right hand side of equation 1 is obtained and the whole equation can be solved an automated numerical solver has been implemented to quicken the procedure a de tailed description of the steps of this method is given in hu sonnerup 2002 hu 2017 see also recent vari ations in the mms community sonnerup et al 2016 hasegawa et al 2019 the output of the gs method includes three magnetic field components the out of plane component determined by the force balance and electric current density given over a rectangular domain surrounding the spacecraft path in summary the gs reconstruction relies on the idea that if a snapshot of the turbulent magnetic field is known to be exactly 2 d and quasi static then it is possible to use cuts through the field in one direction or maybe several cuts to re construct a reasonable facsimile of the turbulence the method is sensitive to island structures i e o points but not very sensitive to the large gradients that can occur near x points indeed the method mostly pro duces current cores but not the sharp boundaries as follows we introduce a method for the identification of these discontinuous boundaries the pvi partial vari ance of increments technique is complementary to the gs method as it seeks to identify coherent structures or intense current sheets that are identified as flux tube boundaries or cores greco et al 2008 and for intense signals possible reconnection sites servidio et al 2011 osman et al 2014 in its basic form pvi is applied to a one dimensional signal such as a time series ob tained in a high speed flow as would be seen by a single spacecraft in the solar wind or by a fixed probe in a wind tunnel pvi is essentially a time series of the mag nitude of a vector increment with a selected time lag normalized by its average over a selected period of time pvi b b 2 2 where b b t b t it depends on three parameters its cadence the time lag and the in 1

the solar wind bulk speed and magnetic field components the green hori zontal lines represent the duration of the reconstructed flux ropes the red stars and the blue circles clearly visible in the inset are the start and end time of pvi events the black arrows indicate locations of larger pvi values terval of averaging greco et al 2018 it is a thresh old method and once a threshold say has been im posed on the pvi time series a collection or hierarchy of events can be identified it has been shown that the probability distribution of the pvi statistic derived from a non gaussian turbulent signal strongly deviates from the probability density function of pvi computed from a gaussian signal for values of pvi greater than about 3 as pvi increases to values of 4 or more the recorded events are extremely likely to be associated with co herent structures and therefore inconsistent with a sig nal having random phases the method is intended to be quite neutral regarding the issue of what mechanism generates the coherent structures it detects indeed the method is sensitive to directional changes magnitude changes and any form of sharp gradients in the vector magnetic field b a comprehensive review of the prop erties of the pvi method provides a broad view of its applications greco et al 2018 4 results we employ in situ measurements of the interplanetary magnetic field and plasma parameters from the wind spacecraft specifically for january 2016 we use the one minute cadence data sets from the magnetic field investigation mfi lepping et al 1995 and the solar wind

projection of the spacecraft path on the flux rope cross section the yellow stars and the green circles represent the start and the end time of the pvi events respectively the distances in the

transformed into spatial dimensions see the ruler inside the plots applying taylor hypothesis data analysis web cdaweb for this period we ob tained 400 magnetic islands or flux tube cross sections via the gs reconstruction and 400 pvi events calcu lated with a time lag 2 min applying a threshold on the pvi signal 3 7 the average that appears in the denominator of equation 2 has been computed over the whole data set servidio et al 2011 in fig ure 1 we show an example of how the pvi and the gs methods work in synergy the plot is a 1 dimensional view of about 2 day data indicating the occurrence of flux ropes with pvi events interposed along with solar wind bulk speed and magnetic field components in the same period the arrows point at the more extreme pvi events that clearly appear at the borders of the mag netic islands the inset provides an expanded view of a shorter period of about 9 hours the requirements com ing for applicability of the gs equations in effect select time intervals during which a possible flux rope appears in appropriate cases we can improve our understand ing of the magnetic field topology through gs recon struction which provides plausible 2 d cross sections of nearby magnetic islands meanwhile the pvi method selects intervals that are suggestive of strong currents which could be cores but for very strong cases tend to be current sheets applying both methods simultaneously enables plausible identification of both flux tubes and coherent current structures at their boundaries and it can be done in any single or multiple spacecraft mea surement some examples of reconstructed flux ropes in 2 d boxes 21 141 points and magnetic structures detected with the pvi method are shown in figure 2 extracted from the same month of analyzed wind data the cross sections of the flux ropes are represented in the local reconstruction frame x y z with the z axis pointing arbitrarily in space representing the cylindrical axis of the flux rope three cases are shown i the leftmost panels display current sheets localized at the borders of a large magnetic island probably x points the lateral extent of this island is of the or der of 2 106 km its z axis is mainly in the gse x y plane ii in the middle panels a longer interval corresponding to a span of about 5 nominal correlation scales is shown within this very large structure we find two pvi events near the left border of the island and one pvi event within the latter can be interpreted as a core current however it is located between two secondary islands showing the complexity of the mag netic field texture here the local z and gse z axes almost coincide iii the rightmost panels show a pvi flux ropes and current sheets in solar wind 5 event found within a magnetic island where the value of bz is larger this is probably a current sheet inter nal to the flux tube associated with bunching of mag netic flux near the central axis which is an o point this flux tube is smaller about 3 104 km across or somewhat less than the average interplanetary correla tion scale in this case the axis of the flux rope points along the gse y axis in the gs method the boundaries of a given flux tube are determined by the requirement that the pressure magnetic flux relation pt a remains single valued and the boundaries appear at points be yond which this can no longer be satisfied in contrast the pvi method identifies a current sheet boundary as a local condition on the vector increment the bound aries are therefore determined independently in the two cases and the finding that they frequently occur in the same or similar positions see figure 1 and figure 2 indicates a synergy in the use of the combined gs pvi method in some reconstructed islands we were not able to classify the pvi events either as x or as o points and we called them neither n events one explana tion for these could be that the spacecraft moving in the solar wind may not come directly across the x or o points one should be cognizant of the fact that current sheets in weakly three dimensional turbulence wan et al 2014 may also appear within flux tubes but separated both from the magnetic axis core and the x points that may be found at the boundary with other flux tubes we are not aware that such current configurations have been reported as emerging in the purely 2 d geometry assumed in the gs method evi dently at least an elevation to a weakly 3 d reduced mhd model is required rappazzo velli 2011 wan et al 2014 nevertheless the gs method may detect sig natures of such currents in the solar wind even if this cannot emerge in a purely 2 d dynamical model the re construction method assumes a local 2 d geometry that is organized by a strong local out of plane guide field bz oughton et al 1994 2015 this state characterized by spatial derivatives along the z direction that are weak relative to those computed in the perpendicular plane consequently a measure of the goodness of the recon struction may be given as the quantity a b 2 bz where the averaging operation is made over a mov ing window by requiring that this quantity is less than 1 we may exclude some reconstructed flux ropes and re tain more trustworthy ones typical values of are of a the order of 0 1 0 2 for the good cases however in a few cases one finds values of a around 0 6 0 8 even if when reconstruction of the flux rope is very good at this point it is interesting to examine statistics of the lo cation of the pvi events with respect to the magnetic is figure 3 histograms of pvi events classified as x points striped red o points plain green and n points crossed blue the histogram bins have the same width equal to 2 starting from pvi 3 7 lands for example are the more intense current sheets occurring at the boundaries of the islands x points the statistical analysis of over 150 refined events is shown in figure 3 the histogram confirms that the events with the highest pvi values are located at the borders of the magnetic islands where one expects tan gential discontinuities and possible x points whereas the cores of the flux ropes o points are characterized by a broad range of pvi values the unclassified events are a few percentages and at relatively small pvi val ues these may be propagating wan et al 2014 and are perhaps more likely rotational discontinuities this observational evidence is in agreement with the numer ical results obtained from a 2 d compressible mhd sim ulation shown in greco et al 2009 a physically ap pealing interpretation emerged very low values of cur rent lie mainly in wide regions lanes among magnetic islands these are associated with local low nonlinear ity and possibly wave like activity howes et al 2018 and other transient random currents greco et al 2016 franci et al 2017 current cores required by ampere s law for any flux tube carrying non zero current popu late the central regions of the magnetic islands or flux tubes and finally small scale current sheet like struc tures form narrow regions sharp boundaries between magnetic islands the current sheets represent the well known small scale coherent structures of mhd tur bulence matthaeus montgomery 1980 veltri 1999 servidio et al 2008 that are linked to the magnetic field intermittency this classification provides a real space picture of the nature of intermittent mhd tur bulence and it found confirmation in the observational data we now turn to a comparison of the electric cur rent densities implied by the gs method and the pvi 6 pecora et al 10 12 10 11 10 10 10 9 10 8 j a m 2 105 106 107 108 109 1010 p d f jpvi jgs figure 4 probability density function of the current den sity evaluated with the gs method red line and from pvi signal blue line method the gs method within the parameters of its approximations returns directly and at each point a value of the current density for the pvi method we can use the empirical result in fig 7 of greco et al 2018 as a basis for estimation of the current in the sharp boundaries the quoted result demonstrates a statisti cal relationship between the normalized current density estimated with the curlometer technique dunlop et al 2002 and the multi spacecraft pvi index computed from mms measurements in earth s magnetosheath the relationship is found employing normalization of the current by its root mean square value a pro cedure needed to compare current measurements with pvi a non dimensional quantity what is suggested in greco et al 2018 is a strong correlation between pvi and current density values that can be expressed as j 2 pvi 3 let us suppose that this statistical relationship ap plies to the wind data in the solar wind so we can use 3 to obtain a measure of j to be useful this proce dure requires obtaining or estimating the value of in the absence of a direct measure of current otherwise one would not need to use the relation 3 a reason able estimate of may be obtained based on comput ing the root mean square rms value of the single spacecraft measured vector magnetic field increments b to convert this value to units of current one divides by the magnetic permeability 0 and a length l 104 km that may be the typical scale of the current sheets this estimate comes from the statistical dis tribution of pvi event duration multiplied by the solar wind speed and it is consistent with existing values in lit erature e g gosling szabo 2008 in this approxi mation a m 2 rms b l 0 where the aver age has been computed over the whole data set having 15 10 11 a m 2 and the entire pvi signal j values come from the empirical expression 3 jpv i a m 2 2 pvi a m 2 4 the numbers for current density obtained in this way may be compared and contrasted with the current ob tained that is implied from the gs reconstruction say jgs within each flux rope sampled along the spacecraft path y 0 accordingly we compute the probability density functions pdfs of jpv i and jgs using these two methods and illustrate the corresponding distribu tions in figure 4 we emphasize that the currents com puted from the two methods are not expected to agree given that the gs current is effectively based on the island cores while the pvi value is based on the bound aries indeed the figure shows that the jpv i distribu tion is displaced toward considerably larger value than the jgs distribution the most probable gs current occurs at a value that is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the most probably pvi current the pvi current distribution also exhibits a noticeable extended tail at large values 5 discussion the gs reconstruction method and the pvi method provide complementary information when implemented together with a single spacecraft time record of mag netic field the results shown here demonstrate this synergy with regard to the overall flux tube structure that is revealed when both methods are employed the gs method is sensitive to the large scale magnetic flux tube structure i e the core currents and o points but is not very sensitive to the sharp boundaries the mostly boundary current sheets and x points the pvi method has the opposite sensitivity providing princi pally information about localized structures that con tribute to intermittency i e the flux tube boundaries and associated current sheets the two methods iden tify structure boundaries independently so the result of this procedure provides a reasonable if not purely rigorous interpretation of the local topology of the magnetic field in the region threaded by the observed data another issue is the estimation of electric current density this is typically measured in closely spaced multi spacecraft missions employing a curlometer tech nique dunlop et al 2002 for example in the cluster and magnetospheric multiscale mms missions cur lometer is unavailable with single spacecraft and only with highly sensitive instruments such as mms fpi fast plasma investigation instrument it is possible to have direct measurement of current density based on the difference in proton ion and electron speeds pollock et al 2016 however using the present meth ods one may estimate currents based on these combined flux ropes and current sheets in solar wind 7 approaches gs reconstruction provides a 2 d picture of the weaker flux tube core currents while the pvi technique along with a variance of increments affords an estimation of the most intense currents at coher ent structures we have demonstrated the combined gs pvi method and provided additional observational evidence that observed solar wind discontinuities are coherent structures associated with the interaction of adjacent magnetic flux tubes greco et al 2008 in particular this type of strong current structure at small scales is readily interpreted as a consequence of the in termittent nature of fully developed mhd turbulence matthaeus et al 2015 the present analysis examines and supports the idea that the solar wind plasma is structured schatten 1971 bruno et al 2001 borovsky 2008 in the sense that flux tubes are filamentary or spaghetti like indeed hu et al 2018 found that the z axis of flux ropes at 1 au tend to be aligned with the parker spiral direction due to dynamical activ ity in the corona or in interplanetary space with moderate to strong axial fields it is widely acknowl edged that the plasma tends to become locally quasi two dimensional matthaeus et al 1990 bieber et al 1996 hamilton et al 2008 macbride et al 2010 narita et al 2010 chen et al 2012 fast local re laxation servidio et al 2008 also favors the 2 d quasi static approximation we employed the presence of discontinuities or coherent current sheets that form be tween these magnetic flux tubes suggests nevertheless ongoing dynamical activity and a subset of these might involve magnetic reconnection dmitruk matthaeus 2006 servidio et al 2011 these structured flux tubes also provide conduits for energetic particle transport and possible trapping tessein et al 2013 khabarova et al 2016 pecora et al 2018 and acceleration indeed one may envision numerous applications in which the com bined gs pvi method may reveal structures relevant to understand complex physics and turbulent interplan etary dynamics the method may be particularly useful for revealing such features for parker solar probe and solar orbiter
