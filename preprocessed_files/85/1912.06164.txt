present the structural parameters of 99 super star clusters sscs in the disk of m 82 moffat eff king and wilson models were fitted using a 2 minimisation method to background subtracted surface brightness profiles sbps in f 435 w b f 555 w v and f 814 w i bands of the advanced camera for surveys acs of the hubble space telescope hst the majority of the ssc profiles is best fitted by the moffat eff profile the scale parameter rd and the shape parameter in the three filters are identical within the measurement errors the analysed sample is big enough to allow characterisation of the distributions of core radii rc and the obtained distribution of rc follows a log normal form with center and log rc pc being 1 73 pc and 0 25 respectively the distribution is also log normal with center and log being 2 88 and 0 08 respectively m 82 is well known for the absence of current star formation in its disk with all disk sscs older than 50 myr and hardly any cluster older than 300 myr the derived distributions compare very well with the distributions for intermediate age clusters in the large magellanic cloud lmc which is also a low mass late type galaxy similar to m 82 on the other hand the distributions of rc in both these galaxies are shifted towards larger values as compared to sscs of similar age in the giant spiral galaxy m 83 m 82 and lmc also span a narrower range of values as compared to that in m 83 key words galaxies clusters general galaxy globular clusters general cata logues 1 introduction understanding the formation and evolution of globular clus ters gcs has been an active field of research in astro physics over the last half century forbes et al 2018 the discovery of clusters as dense 103 m pc 3 and mas sive 104 106 m as gcs but relatively young known as young massive clusters or super star clusters sscs has given a new impetus to these studies in the last two decades bastian 2016 sscs are often thought to be the progen itors of gcs and hence their study has the potential to throw light on the processes that the gcs may have experi enced during their early evolution portegies zwart et al 2010 sscs are subjected to different physical processes at different timescales at short 107 yr and interme diate timescales 107 108 yr stellar evolutionary processes stellar winds supernovae etc play a role at later times 108 yr dynamical processes start becoming important the most dominant of them being the gravitational shocks e mail bolivia inaoep mx due to the interaction of the cluster with the tidal field of its host galaxy and two body relaxation spitzer 1987 these processes increase the velocity of some stars above the es cape velocity forcing them to leave the cluster resulting in the dissipation and or complete disruption of the cluster the selective loss of high velocity stars from the central re gions of the clusters leads to collapse of the core at late times lynden bell et al 1968 the extent to which a cluster is subjected to these effects depends on its 3 dimensional loca tion in its host galaxy galacto centric distance in addition to the gravitational potential field of the host galaxy itself fall zhang 2001 besides clusters located in the disk suf fer from encounters with giant molecular clouds when they pass through the spiral arms gieles et al 2006 mackey et al 2008 analysed the effect of binary and single black holes and found them to be responsible of expansion of the core at times 600 myr in clusters in the large magellanic clouds lmc in the presence of a tidal field the sizes of the expanding clusters would be limited to their tidal radius gieles 2013 the structure of star clusters has been modelled the c 2019 the authors ar x iv 1 91 2 06 16 4 v 1 as tr o ph g a 1 2 d ec 2

follow ing the classical treatment of king 1966 explain satisfac torily the observed surface brightness profiles sbps of old stellar systems such as gcs baumgardt hilker 2018 the most salient feature of these sbps is the existence of a core halo structure with the core characterised by the core radius and the halo limited by the tidal radius on the other hand sbps of slightly younger systems such as the blue population of clusters in the lmc lack core halo structure and instead follow power law forms elson et al 1987 found that these sbps are well represented by mof fat profiles moffat eff profiles henceforth the profile of the most massive and luminous ssc in the lmc r 136 is also consistent with a moffat eff profile elson et al 1992 mackey gilmore 2003 a fitted moffat eff pro files to the sbps of 53 star clusters in the lmc to obtain their structural parameters wilson profiles originally pro posed by wilson 1975 to characterise sbps of elliptical galaxies are also found to be good fits to the sbps of sscs in the lmc mclaughlin van der marel 2005 the power law nature of sbps at relatively younger ages is understood to be due to the contribution of stars in the unbound halo elson et al 1987 moreno et al 2014 hubble space telescope hst especially the wide field of the advanced camera for surveys acs has enabled the detection of large populations of sscs in external galax ies

antennae ngc 4038 4039 whitmore schweizer 1995 clusters have been reported in 20 other nearby spiral and irregu lar galaxies using the hubble legacy archive hla data whitmore et al 2016 modern 2 minimisation technique allows the analysis of the sbps of sscs with empirical formulae in an objective way moffat eff and empirical formulae for king models king 1962 available directly in profile analysing tools such as ishape larsen 1999 and galfit peng et al 2010 are the most often used profiles for fitting sbps of sscs the output parameters commonly obtained by such analysis are core radius and half light radius often for an assumed form of the profile shape e g bastian et al 2008 ryon et al 2015 and ryon et al 2017 carried out the analysis of structural parameters on the hst images of 700 young massive clusters ymcs in the giant spiral m 83 and in two late type galaxies ngc 628 and ngc 1313 they ob tained core radius half light radius and the shape param eters using moffat eff profile in galfit for 478 ymcs that are well resolved on the hst images for the rest of the ymcs they obtained half light radius based on an em pirical relation between the concentration index defined as the difference in magnitudes between 1 and 3 pixel radius apertures and half light radius on mock ymcs ymcs they analysed are in general younger than 1 gyr and constitute the largest sample of intermediate age ymcs with uniformly determined structural parameters mclaughlin van der marel 2005 proposed an al ternative technique to obtain structural parameters of star clusters their method involves fitting the observed profiles directly with the profiles generated using dynamical mod els that have underlying physical basis such as king 1966 and wilson 1975 they also suggested using jeans theo rem to construct dynamical models that are consistent with the empirical moffat eff profile they used this technique to obtain a complete set of dynamical parameters not just core radius and half light radius for gcs in the milky way and fornax galaxies and blue and red star clusters in the smc and lmc galaxies the technique has been recently extended by sollima et al 2015 to implement anisotropic king michie models for clusters of known age and hence known photometric masses this technique is able to ex tract the central and line of sight velocity dispersions the latter parameter could be determined observationally us ing high spectral resolution observations which allows a direct verification of the validity of the assumption of the dynamical models used the hst images of galaxies that are nearer than 5 mpc have sufficient spatial resolution 1 pix 1 25 pc at 5 mpc for the construction of sbps good enough not only for the determination of their sizes but also for a detailed analysis using dynamical models beyond the milky way m 31 and ngc 5128 are the only two giant galax ies where ssc profiles have been analysed using dynamical models barmby et al 2007 mclaughlin et al 2008 wang ma 2013 m 82 is an excellent candidate to carry out such a study as it is relatively nearby 3 63 mpc freedman et al 1994 and has a rich population of clusters in its nucleus and disk mayya et al 2008 spectroscopic ages have been obtained for around 40 of the disk sscs the derived ages occupy a relatively narrow range between 50 300 myr konstan topoulos et al 2009 mayya et al 2006 suggested based on the analysis of the photometric dynamical and chemical properties that the entire galaxy participated in a disk wide burst of duration of a few hundred million years the disk stopped forming stars around 50 myr ago which is well sup ported by the absence of red supergiants in its disk davidge 2008 the disk wide burst and the formation of disk clus ters were most likely triggered by the interaction of m 82 with its neighbours m 81 and ngc 3077 yun 1999 the narrow age range of disk sscs is consistent with them be ing formed in the disk wide burst the existence of a few hundreds of massive sscs all of ages intermediate between the ymcs and the old gcs gives us a great opportunity to understand the dynamical effects experienced by evolving clusters in 2 we summarise the general properties of the sample of sscs in the disk of m 82 as well as the procedure followed in this work to obtain the background subtracted sbps in 3 we describe the sbps expected in theoretical models such as king and wilson and empirical formulae moffat eff as well as the procedure followed to obtain the structural parameters from the observed sbps model derived param eters are presented and their statistical properties discussed in 4 the results are summarised in 5 2 m 82 ssc sample and extraction of surface brightness profiles the sample of sscs for structural analysis was

survey which were made available in reduced form by the hubble heritage team mutchler et al 2007 the image scale corresponds to 0 05 pixel 1 and covers the en tire optical extent of m 82 exposure times were 1600 1360 and 1360 seconds in filters b v and i respectively the zero point magnitudes in the vega system were extracted from sirianni et al 2005 with values 25 779 25 724 and 25 501 for b v and i bands respectively profile fitting packages such as galfit and ishape analyse 2 dimensional 2 d images to obtain structural pa rameters of star clusters on the other hand azimuthally averaged 1 dimensional 1 d profiles have been used tra ditionally to obtain structural parameters of well resolved clusters in the milky way and local group galaxies e g el son et al 1987 mclaughlin van der marel 2005 the profile functions used in both these techniques are 1 d pro files applicable to spherically symmetric 3 d models more over derived structural parameters such as core radius and half light radius refer to the radially symmetric configura tions we hence adopt the 1 d technique in this study the ellipse task jedrzejewski 1987 in iraf stsdas package is the standard tool to obtain the azimuthally averaged 1 d profiles of extended objects though the task is devel oped for analysing the surface brightness profiles of external galaxies the task does an excellent job in obtaining 1 d sbps of clusters on the hst images we fixed the centers of the ellipses at the centroids of the sscs and obtained the sbps at successive hst acs pixels with a width of 1 pixel 0 88 pc at the distance of m 82 the task also cal culates the azimuthal dispersions in the intensity at each radial bin which is a measure of errors in the sbps we left the ellipticity 1 b a where a and b are semi major and semi minor axes respectively and position angle as free parameters in a first run of the task the distribution of el lipticities peaks at 0 19 with only 25 of the sscs having higher ellipticities this is illustrated in fig a 1 of the ap pendix thus the majority of the sscs are nearly circular with 0 3 the well known ssc m 82 f d 1 is one of the most elongated clusters the sbp obtained for this cluster using circular and elliptical 0 30 apertures are similar see fig a 2 in the appendix smith gallagher 2001 also found that the half light radius obtained from profiles using circular and elliptical apertures for m 82 f are simi lar which confirms that the derived structural parameters are not very sensitive to small differences in ellipticities we hence fixed the ellipticity at the minimum value permitted by the task which is 0 05 the surface brightness profiles obtained by the ellipse task contain background contribution which should be sub tracted in order to obtain pure cluster profiles this back ground in the case of m 82 clusters mainly comes from its disk which varies appreciably from one cluster to another this makes the measurement of background for each clus ter mandatory we analysed the four corners of the cut outs for finding an appropriate local background value for each ssc median and standard deviation values were obtained in boxes of 10 10 pixel size at the four corners of the cut out images the minimum of these four values being chosen as the background ibg and the noise bg respectively for each background subtracted profile we determined a limit ing radius defined as the outer most point of the profile at which the cluster surface brightness is equal to 3 times bg we refer to this radius as r 3 cluster sbps are expected to monotonically decrease up to r 3 however we found that the majority of the pro files have an inflexion point at r r 3 visual examination of the images suggested that this is due to stars or clusters in the neighbourhood of the object of analysis when pos sible we masked the contaminating sources in each cut out image before obtaining sbps in a few cases the masks were successful in producing sbps free from contamination from neighbours however in the majority of the cases sbps are affected due to some residual contribution from the neigh bours this is because in most of the cases the contaminating source is another ssc which occupies a non negligible num ber of pixels of the cut out image we took into account this effect by defining a fitting radius for each ssc within which the profile is free from contamination from a neighbour we obtained this radius by determining the innermost inflexion point rip such that at rip d 2 i dr 2 0 for each background subtracted profile in general the fitting radius rfit is the minimum of rip and r 3 however in all cases rip r 3 and hence rfit rip the profile analysis was carried out in the bvi hst acs bands in each of these bands the above pro cedure is repeated hence we have a set of ibg bg rip r 3 and rfit for each band in figure 1 we illustrate the procedure adopted for ob taining the fitting radius for two clusters one unaffected by a contaminating object d 8 and the other with a bright nearby contaminating source d 4 in the former case rip is almost equal to r 3 whereas in the latter case rip is less mnras 000 1 15 2019 4 cuevas

of the disk subsample in order to obtain reliable structural parameters from the hst images star clusters have to satisfy certain criteria the most important of these criteria is that they have enough number of pixels for profile analysis in the absence of a contaminating source the number of pixels for analysis depends on the intrinsic size of the cluster another crite rion for selection of clusters is that the extracted profile is well fit by one of our models quantified by 2 statistics and described in the next section we carried out an analysis of synthetic clusters in order to define the rfit necessary to re liably recover the input parameters which is also described in the next section based on this analysis we considered a cluster to be good for analysis 1 if the rfit 8 pixels in at least two bands and 2 the 2 of the best fit is less than 3 where is the number of degrees of freedom avni 1976 wall jenkins 2003 criterion 1 and 2 respectively in the majority of the cases b and v bands have similar behaviour with the i band displaying a different behaviour with 16 having less than 8 pixels in i the imposition of this criterion reduced our sample size to a subsample of 99 sscs in order to determine how representative is the sub sample with respect to the total sample we compare the distributions of three of the most important characteristics for the two samples in fig 2 the chosen characteristics are v magnitude b v colour and the photometric mass given that most of the disk sscs are formed in a disk wide burst around 300 myr ago little dispersion is expected in the in trinsic colours and mass to light ratios of the sscs however m 82 sscs suffer from considerable extinction which gives rise to large dispersion in their colours in this work we assume that the entire dispersion in the colour histogram is caused by reddening hence extinction corrected mag nitude is directly a measure of the mass for these sscs our subsample contains between 20 40 of the total sample for b v 0 2 2 0 mag v 18 22 mag and logm m 4 5 6 5 dex in summary our subsample represents the bright v 18 0 mag massive m 3 104 m end of the total sample of sscs covering uniformly the entire range of ex tinction values this subsample is complete above mass of m 3 104 m which is very close to the turn over in the mass function for the entire cluster sample mayya et al 2008 thus our subsample is representative of the massive end of the luminosity function 3 determination of structural parameters structural parameters were obtained by fitting the observed sbps with psf convolved theoretical profiles the fitted model profiles are moffat eff elson et al 1987 king king 1966 and wilson wilson 1975 we followed the procedure described in detail in mclaughlin van der marel 2005 which we summarise briefly in this section 3 1 dynamical models of star clusters king and wilson models are based on a lowered maxwellian kinetic energy distribution function of stars these two model structures differ only in the outer halo regions which is due to an extra term in the wilson formu lation and are defined in terms of the distribution function of a relative energy e e 0 where e is the total energy for a star moving with an isotropic velocity v un der a potential the term 0 is a constant such that the relative energy is positive everywhere in the cluster under this formulation the relative potential 0 and e 1 2 v 2 the models described above are given by king f e e e 2 0 1 e 0 0 e 6 0 2 wilson f e e e 2 0 1 e 2 0 e 0 0 e 6 0 3 where 0 is a scale parameter which measures the core dis persion velocity defined as 2 0 4 g 0 r 2 0 9 4 where 0 is the central stellar density and r 0 the scale ra dius commonly referred to as king radius these models are parametrised by a dimensionless potentialw 20 which is defined at all radii inside the tidal radius rt and has the boundary values of w r 0 w 0 and w r rt 0 w 0 is a measure of the central potential being directly related to the often used concentration parameter c log rt r 0 in this work we varied the w 0 values between 2 and 15 which corresponds to c 0 5 and 3 3 for king models and c 0 7 and 4 1 for wilson models the solution of these equations is expressed as a func tion of w r which is directly related to the 3 d density function r through the poisson equation as well as a normalised velocity dispersion profile in terms of the central velocity dispersion solving jeans equation the observable quantity i r is obtained from r by projecting it into the plane of the sky along the r axis following the standard for mulation e g eq 2 138 a in binney tremaine 1987 and dividing by the mass to light ratio i r r 2 rt r r r 2 r 2 1 2 rdr 5 where the integration limits are defined as r r r 0

observed sbps the cluster extends up to the tidal radius rt where by definition e 0 the moffat eff profiles were proposed by elson et al 1987 as a convenient modification of the empirical king profile king 1962 to fit the sbps of lmc clusters the functional form of the profile is i r 2 ltot 2 r 2 d 1 r rd 2 2 6 where r is the semi major axis of the observed profile rd is the characteristic radius which is related to the core radius rc by rd rc 22 1 1 2 7 once and rd are determined from the fitting the 3 d lumi nosity density profile can be calculated using the expression j r j 0 1 r 2 r 2 d 1

terms of the central velocity disper sion 0 the surface mass density is found by projecting the volume mass density r into the plane of the sky fol lowing eq 5 the surface density profile also allows us to calculate numerically rh the radius containing half the total light 3 2 psfs intrinsic cluster profiles are broadened due to the psf of the instrument and hence in order to determine the struc tural parameters especially the core parameter it is essen tial to convolve the model profiles with the instrumental psf profiles before comparing with observed sbps we used the psfex bertin 2011 tool to obtain a psf in each of the three bands before using this tool we selected a list of suit able stars in each of these bands using sextractor bertin 1 10 r pix 10 1 1 i i o d 368 psf figure 4 psf

ellipse at logarithmic steps increasing suc cessively by 10 the cluster profiles are clearly broader than the psf profiles arnouts 1996 a star is considered to be suitable for psf construction if it is isolated and bright but not sat urated we used various sextractor output parameters to select these psf stars more than 1000 stars were used in each of the bands for this purpose 1234 in b 1401 in

with that of the psf each displayed profile is an azimuthally averaged profile obtained as described in 2 1 in this illustration both profiles are sampled in logarithmic steps successively increasing

parameters in order to extract structural parameters from sbps we used the 2 minimisation technique we define 2 as 2 npts i 1 iobsi i modeli 2 2 i 9 where iobsi and i modeli are the i th point in the observed sbp and psf convolved model profile respectively the summa tion is over npts within the fitting radius rfit the i term is the ierr of the azimuthally averaged i th isophote as cal culated by the ellipse task the convolution of the model with the psf was per formed with the fortran routine convlv from numeri cal recipes press et al 1992 which performs a fft for this purpose we sampled both the psf and the model at linear steps of 0 5 pixels which is two times the sampling of the objects the 2 fitting technique is implemented using a fortran program developed for this purpose the best fitting param eters were obtained using a two step procedure in the first step we used a coarse grid in the parameter space to ob tain a preliminary minimum 2 in the second step we used ten times better steps and searched for minimum 2 2 min around the preliminary parameters set to cover a range of four times the coarse step in tab 2 we give the range and the coarse step size for the parameters the fitting procedure starts with coarse grids once a local minimum is found the fine grid is used we repeated the second step around the next two local minima of the first step in all cases the best fit parameter set using fine steps is around the values corresponding to the minimum 2 this two step procedure ensures that the recovered parameters have a numerical pre cision better than the coarse step this also resulted in a parameter set of nearly one thousand models that satisfy the condition 2 2 min 1 the errors on the best fit parameters for all 99 sscs were obtained based

electronic version contains plots such as this for all the 99 sscs tendency is seen for errors being larger for larger values of the parameters these 1 confidence limits are reported as the errors on rd and for all the clusters in tab 3 a similar analysis was carried out to obtain the errors on the param eters of king and wilson models which are also reported in the table 3 4 fits on simulated clusters and minimum rfit as mentioned in 2 1 the choice of rfit is crucial in deter mining reliable structural parameters with the aim of de termining the minimum number of pixels required for this we carried out a profile fitting procedure on simulated clus ters the mock sample of clusters constituted 10 clusters all following moffat eff profiles and covering the extreme ranges of the parameter space an rms noise is added to the simulated images which are also convolved with the psfs described in 3 2 in order to simulate the observational ef fects the structural parameters of the mock sample were recovered following the same procedure as that for the sam ple clusters for each cluster we obtained structural param eters for several values of rfit starting at 6 pixels and all the way up to rfit r 3 for each of these rfit values we obtained the best fit parameters as well as their error ellipses we found that for rfit 8 pixels 2 min values in general were greater than 3 and hence do not satisfy our selection criteria in fig 6 we show the results of the simulations in vs rd plane for three values of rfit 1 rfit r 3 2 rfit rip and 3 rfit 8 pixels as expected rfit r 3 has the least error with the maximum error being for the rfit 8 pixels even in the latter case the recovered values are in good agreement with respect to the initial values thus we conclude from these simulations that the parameters values recovered with rfit 8 pixels for our observed sample are reliable 3 5 method to select the best model a fit is considered to be good if 2 min is of the order of the degrees of freedom wall jenkins 2003 which in our general case is npts 2 however in fitting sbps it is common to obtain 2 min even when fits are good mclaughlin van der marel 2005 this is because it is necessary to sample the central parts at steps of at least 1 pixel in order to define the sbps which is more than a factor of two oversampled with respect to the typical psf values this makes the sbp values at successive points not com pletely independent of each other i e i of successive points are correlated making 2 min we used the rms errors in the azimuthally averaged intensities as i in the 2 equation and hence there may be some contribution to the i from real azimuthal variations which also will make 2 min some sscs have 2 min 3 which implies the best fit model does not represent perfectly the observed sbp in fig 7 we show the results for the best fitting param eters for an illustrative cluster for each of the three model profiles in the left most panel we show the results for the best fitting moffat eff model and in the other two pan els we show the results for the best fitting wilson and king models in the second panel we show an rgb image for the same cluster in each

min values for the best fit moffat eff king and wilson models are not very different implying that the fits are equally good for more than one model mclaughlin van der marel 2005 proposed a method to determine quantitatively the best among these models we adopted their technique for fits obtained for each filter for every cluster this method consists of defining a 2 as 2 2 alt 2 ref 2 alt 2 ref 10 where 2 ref and 2 alt are the 2 min values of the reference model and the model to be compared two models are consid ered to be equally good if 2 60 2 whereas the reference model is good for 2 0 2 in fig 8 we show the 2 distributions for all the 99 sscs with moffat eff as the reference model around 45 of the clusters have 2 60 2 indicating that all the three models are fit equally well for these clusters moffat eff models are good fits for 95 97 of the sscs with only 3 5 of sscs requiring king or wilson models these conclusions also apply to the fits in the other two bands but with the best fit moffat eff percentage being around 15 lower thus in general m 82 sscs are well represented by moffat eff models and hence we will use the parameters obtained by moffat eff in the v band as the characteris tic values for all clusters an examination of the half light radius rh values indicates that even for the 45 of the clus ters represented equally well by any one of the three models moffat eff parameters are more reliable than the other two models in fig 9 we illustrate this where we plot the rh of king models against those obtained from moffat eff mod els for the 99 sscs the error bars on rh are obtained by propagating the errors on the basic derived parameters for each model see 3 3 clusters for which fits are equally good with king and moffat eff models are distinguished from those for which moffat eff models are good it can be seen that rh values for king models are overestimated in several cases independent of if king is a good fit or not in table 3 we show the best fitted shape w 0 or scale r 0 or rd and central surface brightness 0 and i 0 pa rameters for all the three models along with the 2 min values for the fits in the v band data for each cluster are organised in three rows the first row shows the results for moffat eff the second row for king models and the third row for wilson models for the last four columns we give their respective error bars the error bars on shape and scale parameters are based on the analysis in 3 3 the error bars in the central surface brightness are based on these errors propagated in quadrature following the prescription of mclaughlin van der marel 2005 the 2 min given in column 4 is related to the reduced 2 by the number of degrees of freedom which in our case is equal to npts 2 given that we have two fitted parameters hence 2 2 min npts 2 for all of our clusters 2 3 in the v band for at least one of the three models mnras 000 1 15 2019 10 cuevas otahola et al 1 0 1 2 2 alt 2 moffat 2 alt 2 moffat

correspond to the king vs moffat eff blue and wilson vs moffat eff red for 2 0 2 2 60 2 and 2 0 2 respectively for 44 45 of the clusters the fits are equally good for any of the three models with moffat eff model providing a better fit 2 0 2 for a further 50 53 for only 3 5 of the clusters 2 0 2 king or wilson models provide a better fit than moffat eff model 3 6 comparison with galfit and ishape galfit peng et al 2010 and ishape larsen 1999 are two widely used tools for obtaining structural parameters of extragalactic clusters in order to ensure that there are no systematic offsets in the values of structural parameters obtained by our fitting tool with those obtained with these two tools we carried out the fits with the moffat eff pro files on all our sample clusters with these two tools the psf images as well as the fitting radius for each cluster are retained from our analysis in the case of ishape we oversampled our psf image by a factor of ten using the tool magnify in iraf as required by the code fittings were carried out on 2 d images of 101 101 pixel cut outs both these codes have their own algorithm for background deter mination the values are left free for galfit whereas for ishape we used our best fit values for each cluster in fig 10 we compare our rd values with those from gal fit and ishape we observe that in general our values are in excellent agreement with those of galfit and are consistent within the errors with those of ishape but with a slope of 1 3 instead of unity the lengths of the error bars in galfit are very similar to ours whereas ishape val ues have larger error bars we checked that these error bars and the values do not vary much for a fixed value of 3 1 0 10 0 rh m pc 1 10 100 r h k pc 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 figure 9 half

large circles better fit with moffat eff models red medium sized circles and those well repre sented with king models green small circles the rh derived from both the models agree with each other for rh 10 pc inde pendent of which model produced the best fit beyond this radius the error bar on the rh derived from king models is systemati cally larger than those for the moffat eff models we note that this is even true for the three clusters for which king model pro duced the best fit green vertical lines 4 results and discussions in the previous section we concluded that moffat eff models adequately represent all our subsample of 99 sscs model fitting directly gives us four parameters namely rd 0 and ltot core radius rc the radius at which the surface brightness is half its peak value is related to rd through eqn 7 the half light radius rh is another param eter that can be calculated from these parameters see 3 5 dynamical analysis of the fitted model profiles along with a knowledge of mass to light ratio for m 82 sscs allows us to calculate four more parameters mass the central veloc ity dispersion 0 central mass density 0 and central mass surface density 0 not all these parameters are indepen dent of each other evolved objects like gcs show a tight inverse correlation between rc and 0 kormendy 1985 these correlations are part of the fundamental plane for gcs djorgovski 1995 mclaughlin 2000 a detailed anal ysis of all the derived parameters will be carried out in a forthcoming paper in this paper we will characterise the basic parameters obtained in the three bands 4 1 colour dependence of the derived parameters we have carried out independent analysis of sbps in three filters for all our sample sscs to study the possible colour mnras 000 1 15 2019

derived parameters in figs 11 12 and 13 we compare the distribution of rd and 0 for moffat eff models in the three filters the intention of showing these distributions is to compare the shape as well as the center of the distributions median values are indicated in all the plots by vertical dashed lines median values of rd in the three filters are very similar with a value 2 0 pc in all the three filters the distribution is asymmetric with its peak lying at 1 pc to the left of the median value and having a long tail that reaches up to 7 9 pc the behaviour of distribution is very similar to that of rd with the median value of 3 0 for the three filters 0 median values in the three filters are 0 b 19 2 0 v 18 5 0 i 17 5 mag arcsec 2 from these plots we conclude that the distributions in the three filters are similar hence we use the values in the v band in the rest of our analysis 4 2 functional form of distribution following the seminal study of elson et al 1987 power law form of the sbps represented by the moffat eff profile is considered to be the characteristic feature of young sscs on the other hand king profiles king 1962 are applicable to more evolved systems such as gcs elson et al 1987 found the power law form extends to beyond the tidal radius in young clusters they argue that clusters take around 2 to 3 orbital periods to get rid of the stars outside the tidal radius and hence have to be older than 1 gyr to show a king sbp until that time the escaped stars would be located in an unbound halo mackey gilmore 2003 a analysed the sbps obtained from hst images of a sample of 53 lmc clusters using moffat eff profiles with as much as 25 clusters in this sample being younger than 1 gyr this happens to be the only case where young and intermediate age well resolved clusters have been analysed using a uniform set of moffat eff parameters for this reason the parameter set ob tained by mackey gilmore 2003 a has become the bench mark against which parameters of sscs in other galax ies have been compared with our analysis of nearly 100 intermediate age 50 300 myr sscs offers an opportunity to understand the transition from power law shaped young clusters to king profile shaped gcs the measures the slope of the power law sbp at large radii see eqn 6 a 2 corresponds to the case of a king profile with an infinite value of concentration parameter and infinite mass for real clusters 2 the higher the value of the steeper is the outer slope in fig 14 top panel we show the distribution of for m 82 sscs the distribution is well represented by a log normal function of log 0 08 centered at 2 88 which is close to the median value of 3 0 this value agrees well with the median value found for clus ters in the lmc and other nearby galaxies portegies

dissipationless systems cluster formation in their parent molecular cloud should be 100 efficient for the real clusters to be dissipationless on the other hand real clusters are expected to contain some resid ual gas within the cluster volume which would be expelled from the cluster in the first 10 myr when massive stars end their lives as supernovae the loss of gravitational energy of the expelled gas mass makes the cluster expand which even tually shapes the outer part of the density profile bastian goodwin 2006 as the residual gas fraction or equiva lently efficiency of cluster formation is expected to vary from one cluster to the other real clusters are expected to have a wide range of values in this scenario of cluster forma tion an alternative scenario is that the gas continues to flow into the cluster volume even after the first supernovae explo sions fujii et al 2012 parker et al 2014 this is recently found to be the case in dense progenitor clouds of massive clusters in the milky way walker et al 2015 under this scenario clusters do not necessarily expand freely following the multiple supernovae explosions silich tenorio tagle 2017 it is likely that such

rc distribution we now discuss the distribution of rc for our sample of sscs with rc 0 1 pc elson et al 1992 mackey gilmore 2003 a r 136 in the lmc often considered as the prototype for a young ssc is one of the most compact sscs known several young extragalactic sscs also are found to have sub parsec values of rc portegies zwart et al 2010 bastian et al 2008 found a tendency for rc to increase with age which they interpreted as an evidence for expansion of sscs in fig 15 top panel we show the distribution of the core radius rc from our study the distribution fits very well with a log normal function centered at rc 1 73 pc and log rc pc 0 25 the median value of the distribution is 1 62 pc which is close to the peak of the log normal dis tribution the study of bastian et al 2008 includes m 82 disk sscs from the spectroscopic sample of konstantopou los et al 2009 for which they report a median value of rc 2 2 pc which falls well within the range of our rc val ues we used the same dataset as for to compare our rc values with that in other galaxies in the bottom panel we show a plot comparing the distributions where each dis tribution is fitted with a log normal function the central value rc and of the function are given in table 4 lmc and m 83 clusters with ages similar to that in m 82 disk 50 500 myr have mean rc value higher and lower respectively as compared to that in m 82

increase in mean rc for similar age clusters is probably suggesting that the morphological type has a role in core evolution at intermediate ages we also note that at older 500 myr ages m 83 clusters

other nearby galaxies are compared with that of m 82 the m 82 sample the trend is weaker but the trend is also weaker for lmc smc and m 83 sscs that have a similar range of ages as that of m 82 sscs

300 myr sscs in the disk of m 82 using the intensity profiles derived from hst images in f 435 w f 555 w and f 814 w bands these clusters have a narrow range of ages between 50 300 myr which provides an excel lent opportunity to understand the structural parameters at ages intermediate between young super star clusters and old globular clusters structural parameters were de rived for the king wilson and moffat eff models using the standard 2 minimisation technique errors on the ex tracted parameters were determined based on the 2 statis tics of the fitting models experiments on mock

isothermal models which have intrinsically axially symmetric ra dial intensity profiles e g king 1966 however observed clusters are not always spherically symmetric in such cases it is a com mon practice to obtain radial intensity profiles of observed clus ters using circularly symmetric isophotes in this appendix we discuss the effect of obtaining surface brightness profiles sbps using almost circular isophotes for clusters that may have a non negligible ellipticity in fig a 1 we show the distribution of el lipticity for our sample of 99 sscs in the disk of m 82 these ellipticities

electronic edition a portion is shown here for guidance each cluster in the v band using the iraf stsdas task ellipse the plotted value corresponds to the average of ellipticities at three consecutive ellipses centered at rfit in the figure we also show the cumulative distribution of ellipticity the distribution of ellipticities peaks at 0 19 with only 25 of the sscs having higher ellipticities thus the majority of the sscs are nearly circular in figure a 2 we illustrate the effect of using almost circu lar rings 0 05 for measuring the sbp of a cluster that has 0 30 we chose well known ssc m 82 f d 1 one of the most elongated clusters for illustration we follow the same procedure as explained in sec 3 to fit the profiles using moffat eff model to the sbp obtained from 0 30 the observed sbps obtained with 0 05 and 0 3 along with the respective best fit models are shown in the figure the rd and values for these two sbps are identical within the errors of the measurements this illustrates that the derived structural parameters are not very sensitive to small differences in ellipticities hence obtain ing sbps using circular apertures gives equally good values for clusters
