china received accepted abstract we present a detailed characterization of the kepler 411 system koi 1781 this system was previously known to host two transiting planets one with a period of 3 days r 2 4 r kepler 411 b and one with a period of 7 8 days r 4 4 r kepler 411 c as well as a transiting planetary candidate with a 58 day period r 3 3 r koi 1781 03 from kepler photometry here we combine kepler photometry data and new transit timing variation ttv measurements from all the kepler quarters with previous adaptive optics imaging results and dynamical simulations in order to constrain the properties of the kepler 411 system from our analysis we obtain masses of 25 6 2 6 m for kepler 411 b and 26 4 5 9 m for kepler 411 c and we confirm the planetary nature of koi 1781 03 with a mass of 15 2 5 1 m hence the name kepler 411 d furthermore by assuming near coplanarity of the system mutual inclination below 30 we discover a nontransiting planet kepler 411 e with a mass of 10 8 1 1 m on a 31 5 day orbit which has a strong dynamical interaction with kepler 411 d with densities of 1 71 0 39 g cm 3 and 2 32 0 83 g cm 3 both kepler 411 c and kepler 411 d belong to the group of planets with a massive core and a significant fraction of volatiles although kepler 411 b has a sub neptune size it belongs to the group of rocky planets key words planetary systems stars individual kepler 411 techniques dynamical simulations 1 introduction the data from the kepler mission have revealed thousands of exoplanets and exoplanet candidates through the transit method borucki et al 2010 after the demise of the old primary kepler mission the extended kepler mission k 2 has been revealing many new exoplanet candidates howell et al 2014 while being very powerful the transit method cannot provide the masses of the discovered transiting bodies and there fore mass measurements have been carried out for only a rather small fraction of the discovered planetary candidates either with the radial velocity rv method or with the transit timing vari ation ttv method jontof hutter et al 2015 hadden lith wick 2017 the rv technique measures the reflex motion of a host star induced by its planet and hence the signal shrinks with increasing orbital distance while the latter detects the grav itational perturbations between planets in multi planet systems by precisely measuring transit times and subsequently fitting dy namical models or derived analytic formulae to the observed ttvs miralda escud 2002 agol et al 2005 holman mur ray 2005 holman et al 2010 nesvorn et al 2012 lithwick et al 2012

gravitational interactions between planets that are closely spaced or near orbital resonances in addition to the positive de pendence on the orbital distance agol et al 2005 holman murray 2005 characterizing planets using ttvs is therefore complementary to the rv method agol et al 2005 holman murray 2005 nesvorn morbidelli 2008 nesvorn et al 2012 jontof hutter et al 2015 agol fabrycky 2017 through an analysis of the continuous high precision photo metric data collected by the kepler space telescope one can not only determine the radii and orbital paramaters of transiting exo planets but can also infer or at least constrain the masses of the exoplanets by studying their dynamical interactions the plane tary mass is a fundamental physical parameter of an exoplanet which is required for the investigation of further planetary prop erties such as the composition structure and also the formation and evolution of the planetary system seager et al 2007 fort ney et al 2007 baraffe et al 2008 2010 enoch et al 2012 lopez et al 2012 lopez fortney 2014 kouwenhoven et al 2016 the vast majority of the host stars of the currently known exoplanets are of late spectral type and are therefore to some de gree magnetically active specifically stellar activity in late type stars induces photometric modulations and apparent rv varia tions which may hamper the detection of planets and the accu rate measurement of the system parameters sozzetti et al 2007 enoch et al 2010 czesla et al 2009 oshagh et al 2015 star spots can deform the transit light curves for example through article number

the gravitational perturbations of other plan ets oshagh et al 2013 b daassou et al 2014 ioannidis et al 2014 2016 ioannidis schmitt 2016 sun et al 2017 there fore appropriately accounting for the effects of stellar activity on transit light curves becomes absolutely necessary for charac terizing exoplanets orbiting relatively active host stars in this study we present our comprehensive analysis and characterization of the multiple planetary system kepler 411 in section 2 we provide a brief description of our target system and in section 3 we describe the methods used to extract the transit signals and derive the planetary properties in section 4 we give the results of our ttvs and dynamical simulation analyses and in section 5 we discuss the new results and constrain the compo sitions of kepler 411 s transiting planets finally we summarize the study in section 6 2 the kepler 411 planetary system the host star kepler 411 is a k 2 v type star located at a dis tance of 153 59 0 48 pc gaia collaboration et al 2018 lin degren et al 2018 berger et al 2018 exhibiting features that indicate relatively strong magnetic activity besides rotational modulation with a periodicity of about 10 days as seen in the kepler light curve hirano et al 2014 we find that strong emis sions are detected in the cores of the ca ii h k lines by visu ally inspecting the spectroscopic data in the keck observatory archive 1 kepler 411 has a red companion at an angular sep aration of 3 37 0 05 which is fainter than kepler 411 by j 2 71 0 1 mag wang et al 2014 kepler 411 was previously identified as koi 1781 three planetary candidates around koi 1781 were successively dis covered by the kepler transiting planet search pipeline and the public planet hunters project tenenbaum et al 2012 schwamb et al 2012 batalha et al 2013 rowe et al 2014 ttv signals of these three planetary candidates were also detected ford et al 2012 mazeh et al 2013 rowe et al 2014 subsequently the planetary nature of koi 1781 02 porb 3 0 days kepler 411 b and koi 1781 01 porb 7 8 days kepler 411 c were confirmed by wang et al 2014 and morton et al 2016 re spectively hence the designation kepler 411 wang et al 2014 and morton et al 2016 derived a confidence level for the plane tary nature of koi 1781 03 porb 58 days hereafter we desig nate this body as kepler 411 d of over 98 7 but the planetary nature of this object has not yet be confirmed most interestingly the amplitude of the ttvs seen in kepler 411 d reaches up to about 50 minutes while those of two confirmed planets are smaller than 5 minutes furthermore the three orbital periods do not approach any commensurability that is mean motion resonances whereby the perturbations between planets are amplified and therefore induce significant ttv sig nals to further unravel the planetary architecture of the kepler 411 system we continue our investigation of this peculiar plan etary system and present our analysis below 3 data analysis 3 1 data preparation and transit searching the kepler data of kepler 411 were downloaded from the mast archive 2 which contains the data recorded in the 17 quar ters we use both long and short cadence data available for 1 https www 2 keck hawaii edu koa public koa php 2 https archive stsci edu kepler quarters q 10 to q 17 we use the pdcsap data for our analy sis we show a part of the light curve of kepler 411 in the upper panel of fig 1 one easily identifies peak to peak variations of 2 4 in the light curve indicating that the host star of kepler 411 is relatively active through an analysis of the light curve with the generalized lomb scargle periodogram zechmeister kuerster 2009 we find a clear rotation period of 10 4 0 03 days to characterize the system and to search for and analyze ttvs it is essential to remove the effects of stellar activity as much as possible to that end we adopt the same methodology as in ioannidis et al 2014 to extract all transit signals from kepler data and detrend each transit light curve for normal transit signals that is single planet transits we select a window of twice the transit duration approximately centered on the mid transit time of each transit light curve and detrend each light curve with a second order polynomial fit to the out of transit data for anomalous transits that is two or more planet tran sits we use a wider window i e a window of triple the transit duration of kepler 411 d to retrieve those transits where two or more planets transit the host star simultaneously furthermore to visually validate our normalization of the transit light curves we use a savitzky golay filter set to second order with a 16 hour window to remove the rotational modulations in the light curve of kepler 411 prior to filtering the light curves we substitute all transits with the polynomial fit results of the out of transit data in order to retain the characteristics of each transit extracted with our procedure through inspection of the detrended light curve we can easily identify inappropriately detrended transit signals and repeat the detrending procedure for these inappro priately detrended transit signals usually originate from incor rect fits due to outliers in out of transit data therefore we fit the out of transit again without these outliers to demonstrate our methodology we show a part of the kepler 411 light curve with rotational modulation signals filtered out in the bottom panel of fig 1 as described above stellar activity may hide the transit sig nals of earth like exoplanets in order to search for possible tran sit signals which are obscured by stellar activity we employ the box fitting least square algorithm kov cs et al 2002 to search the light curves detrended by using the savitzky golay filter with the known transit signals removed we find no evidence for any significant transit like signal 3 2 model fitting stellar activity can not only create bumps on a transit light curve when star spots or faculae are occulted by the planet but can also lead to variable depths of normalized transit light curves due to the influence of stellar activity on the total flux of the host star czesla et al 2009 ioannidis schmitt 2016 sun et al 2017 we employ the spot and transit modeling tool stmt as described in sun et al 2017 to model the normal transit light curves of kepler 411 the recently updated stmt has not only the capability to model the combined effect of spots and planets on the light curve simultaneously but can also be used to effi ciently simulate double transit curves of an active host star using the analytic formulae derived by p l 2012 and montalto et al 2014 even light curves that include rare mutual planet planet eclipse events can be modeled by the updated stmt the new version of the stmt code was successfully tested on the sys article number page 2 of 11 leilei sun et al kepler 411 a four planet system with an active host star tem koi 94 with mutually eclipsing planets koi 94 d and koi 94 e hirano et al 2012 we adopt the standard quadratic limb darkening law inter polating the limb darkening coefficients from the table of claret et al 2013 based on the stellar parameters of kepler 411 de rived by wang et al 2014 because of the low signal to noise ratio s n of the transits sampled with short cadence data we use the mean density of the host star derived from interpolat ing the empirical relation of torres et al 2010 as a prior to fit these data we note that the mean density of the host star can be inferred from normalized orbital semi major axis a r combined with kepler s third law when modeling the transit light curves furthermore we adopt the calibration derived by enoch et al 2012 to convert the mean density the effective temperature teff and the metallicity fe h of the host star into its mass a method which is also used by the superwasp team and other groups collier cameron et al 2006 2007 brown et al 2012 wang et al 2014 sun et al 2015 therefore the ratios between the radii and masses of the exoplanet and the host star respec tively can be converted into the actual planetary radius and mass and hence the uncertainty of the planet s radius and mass due to those in the host star can be appropriately estimated we first use the normal transit light curves extracted from the short cadence data to construct a fiducial model of each known transiting body we note that we only select the transit light curves near the local flux maximum to calculate the physical pa rameters since these local maxima tend to be less affected by star spots these fiducial models form the basis for modeling spot crossing events and double transit events because there is a strong degeneracy between transit parameters and spot prop erties derived from spot distorted transit light curves sun et al 2017 the short cadence data constrain the parameters of a transiting body better than the long cadence data short cadence data which have a sampling interval of 1 minute on the one hand keep the morphology of the transit light curve on the other hand when many short cadence light curves are modeled simul taneously short cadence data with sufficient sampling can pos sibly alleviate the influence of stellar activity and the systematic errors of the light curves of kepler 411 on the measurement of transit parameters in figs 2 3 and 4 we show our best fit re sults of the respective transit light curves we further list the best fit system parameters of each planet in table 1 as derived from modeling the transit light curves subsequently we calculate the transit times through fitting each transit light curve extracted from the long cadence data with physical parameters fixed to the values derived from the short cadence data we adopt the resampling strategy proposed by kipping 2010 to construct the model of transit light curves in the long cadence sampling since only eight quarters of short cadence data are available for the four year observing baseline we only use the long cadence data to calculate the ttvs for the transit light curves with apparent bumps in the ingress and or egress parts we adopt a similar strategy to sun et al 2017 to model these light curves in order to remove the possible influ ences on the measured transit times induced by spot crossing events to briefly summarize we employ one or two circular spot s to reproduce the distorted light curves by spot crossing events with the transit model fixed we note that we do not im pose the constraint that some consecutive transits are modeled with the same spots the derived transit times are listed in ta ble 2 table 3 and table 4 we also fit the double transit light curves with these transit models using the updated stmt code in fig 5 we show two double transit events to demonstrate the validity of our methodology we note that the fits of the double transits significantly improve the ttv measurements of kepler 411 d since only seventeen transit events of this planet have been recorded during the four years of observations finally we de rive a more precise stellar mass m 0 870 0 039 m and ra dius r 0 820 0 018 r using the improved measurement of the stellar mean density obtained through our transit light curve modeling with more data than before these values are consis tent with the previous measurements by wang et al 2014 that is m 0 83 0 04 0 10 m and r 0 79 0 07 0 06 r 4 transit timing variation and dynamical stability analysis 4 1 transit timing variation inversion 4 1 1 transit timing variation inversion code we employ the widely used ttv inversion code ttvfast deck et al 2014 to generate model transit times of each of the planets at the observed epoch the genetic evolution markov chain gemc and differential evolution adaptive metropolis dream algorithms are used in the ttv inversion code to per form parameter optimization and estimation as implemented in the stmt code see sun et al 2017 for further details gemc is an efficient optimization algorithm developed by tregloan reed et al 2013 which combines the superior global opti mization power of genetic algorithms charbonneau 1995 with the capability of parameter estimation of widely applied differ ential evolution markov chain monte carlo demcmc algo rithms ter braak 2006 in the exoplanet research field for simu lating high dimensional multi modal systems the dream al gorithm proposed by vrugt et al 2009 is another derivative of the demcmc algorithms and adopts a self adaptive random ized subspace sampling strategy which inherits most of the ad vantageous properties of the demcmc algorithm and performs better through increasing the diversity of the exploration of pa rameter space when the code carries out the ttv inversion it generates model ttvs and then fits them to the measured ttvs finally for a preliminary evaluation of the long term stability of the synthetic system we implemented a hill stability crite rion in our code to remove the most unstable planetary archi tectures marchal bozis 1982 gladman 1993 in addition to evaluating synthetic systems we also tested our code on the koi 872 system and found that the optimal solution was identi cal to that of nesvorn et al 2012 4 1 2 initial ttv inversion of kepler 411 d as mentioned in the introduction only kepler 411 d shows large ttvs while no commensurability is found among the orbital periods of the three known transiting bodies these observations suggest that there is at least one more nonvisible planet in or bit around kepler 411 in addition to the three transiting planets this additional planet may be in or near a mean motion reso nance with kepler 411 d in order to test this hypothesis we use our ttv inversion code to search for the optimal orbital archi tecture of this new perturber to improve the efficiency of the dynamical modeling we initially only include kepler 411 d in addition to the new perturber because of the the weak dynamical interactions of kepler 411 d with the two other known planets as the ttv patterns are most sensitive to the perturber s mass the orbital period or orbital separation the eccentricity and the mutual inclination of the orbit agol et al 2005 hol man murray 2005 nesvorn morbidelli 2008 nesvorn article number page 3 of 11 a a proofs manuscript no 34275 corr final two column 2009 nesvorn beaug 2010 xie 2014 agol fabrycky 2017 we set appropriate constraints to these parameters during the search for the optimal solution for the mass of the perturber we impose a uniform prior between 0 1 m and 300 m in order to cover the possible architectures the search interval for the or bital period of the perturber is set uniformly between 3 and 580 days the lower limit corresponds to the orbital period of the in nermost planet while the upper limit is set to ten times the orbital period of kepler 411 d the possibility of wider orbit perturbers is discussed in sects 5 1 and 5 2 we find that the inversion code cannot always find the optimal solution for synthetic ttvs which are similar to the ttvs of kepler 411 d when the search interval of the orbital period of the perturber is much larger than 0 5 days and trial chains of 1 000 are used in the gemc algo rithm however the code always finds the optimal solution when the search interval is set to 0 5 days for trial chains of 1 000 in the gemc algorithm therefore we split the search interval of the orbital period of the perturber into multiples of the 0 5 day inter val and search all subintervals each time when we use our code to carry out the initial inversion of the ttvs of kepler 411 d we impose a uniform prior to the eccentricity between e 0 and e 0 2 as required by the long term stability of the sys tem which is demonstrated in the kepler compact multi planet systems lissauer et al 2011 fabrycky et al 2014 xie et al 2016 in addition a uniform prior is imposed on the mutual in clination which is constrained between 0 and 30 nesvorn 2009 mainly because larger mutual inclinations will probably trigger significant transit duration variations tdv for compact multiple planetary systems and tend to make this kind of system unstable for a long run nesvorn et al 2012 mills fabrycky 2017 on the other hand no significant tdv signals of kepler 411 d have been detected i e the root mean square of the tdvs of kepler 411 d is almost equal to the median of the uncertainties of transit duration times the upper limit of the variation rate of the transit durations of kepler 411 d is about 4 mins 1300 days besides these four parameters three more parameters are ini tialized the longitude of the ascending node the argument of periastron and the mean anomaly m at a reference time deck et al 2014 the tightly packed multi planet kepler systems tend to be coplanar like our solar system winn fabrycky 2015 xie et al 2016 we explicitly fix the of kepler 411 d to zero and vary the of the new perturber among the in terval between 30 and 30 in order to improve efficiency of ttv modeling and the search intervals of argument of perias tron and mean anomaly are set to the physical boundary that is 180 180 and m 0 360 so as to accelerate the mcmc sampling e cos and e sin are used as free parameters to explore the parameter spaces of e and in our in version code where e and are the eccentricity and argument of periastron respectively ford 2005 eastman et al 2013 we find that the dynamical modeling uniquely generates the reduced minimum 2 of 3 8 i e the reduced minimum 2 which is larger than unity is probably induced by the underestimation of transit time uncertainties when the orbital period of the per turber is equal to 31 5 days taking the possible underestimation of transit time uncertainties into account we use the reduced 2 of the optimal fitting derived from gemc simulation in the ttv inversion code to scale the errors of measured transit times namely all errors are multiplied by a factor of 2 and then employ the mcmc algorithm to sample the parameter posterior distributions based on the scaled errors the orbital period ra tio between kepler 411 d and the newly identified perturber is 1 84 which is near the 2 1 or 9 5 mean motion resonance with kepler 411 d moreover the orbital period ratio between kepler 411 c and the perturber is 4 02 the impact parameter b of the perturber is 1 6 i e b 1 rp r based on the extracted or bital architecture this provides strong evidence for the hypoth esis that the 31 5 day perturber is a nontransiting planet here after we label this new planet as kepler 411 e 4 1 3 joint transit timing variation inversions as shown in sect 4 1 2 an additional nontransiting fourth planet kepler 411 e is necessary to reproduce the measured ttvs of kepler 411 d moreover kepler 411 d is shown to be a genuine planetary companion of kepler 411 see sect 5 2 in this subsection we jointly simulate the ttvs of the three known transit signals assuming that one additional nontransiting per turber exists in the system we adopt the same parameter priors and boundaries as used in sect 4 1 2 except for the orbital period and inclination since these parameters are well constrained by transit light curves however the values derived from modeling the transit light curves are the averages of these parameters at the observation baseline but the input parameters of ttvfast are a set of in stantaneous variables representing the dynamical state of a sys tem at the initial reference time deck et al 2014 therefore we sample the initial inclination corresponding to the nominal value and uncertainty derived from modeling transit light curves the search interval of the orbital period is centered on the val ues derived from modeling the transit light curves and is uni formly spread over intervals of 0 2 days a typical uncertainty of 0 2 days is much larger than the uncertainty of orbital pe riod derived from modeling transit light curves but this value likely covers the possible variation of instantaneous period the optimal physical parameters resulting from the numerous ttv inversions are illustrated in table 1 for the four planet orbital ar chitecture these optimal models are plotted in figs 6 7 and 8 with the measured ttv signals many authors have shown the existence of degeneracies be tween planet mass and eccentricity and even the differential ar gument of orbital periastron of two planets i e 1 2 extracted from ttvs near by first order or higher order mean motion resonances bou et al 2012 lithwick et al 2012 deck agol 2015 goz dziewski et al 2016 macdonald et al 2016 nesvorn vokrouhlick 2016 agol fabrycky 2017 these imply that the parameter spaces of the ttv inversion are highly correlated and hence insufficient samplings can easily misrepre sent the measured ttvs in order to validate our ttv inversion results we carry out additional ttv modeling with two different eccentricity priors for four planet orbital architectures i an ec centricity fixed to zero and ii eccentricities drawn from a uni form distribution u 0 0 1 when the orbits of all or a subset of the planets in the kepler 411 system are circular the measured ttvs are not well reproduced in the second case all ttvs are well fitted and the results are comparable to the case when the modeling of the eccentricities is restricted to u 0 0 2 as ex pected the optimum fits for the planetary masses are mutually consistent at the 1 significance level for the two different ec centricity priors but the optimum fits for the orbital eccentric ities are different similar results were also found in the ttv inversions of macdonald et al 2016 for the kepler 80 system therefore we are confident that the masses extracted from our ttv modeling are reliable global optimal values article number page 4 of 11 leilei sun et al kepler 411 a four planet system with an active host star 4 2 dynamical stability 4 2 1 stability analyses with analytic criterions as described in sect 4 1 1 the ttv inversion code includes a hill stability criterion for two planet systems although this ini tial check filters out the least stable systems it cannot guaran tee the long term stability of the derived orbital architecture of a four planet system on one hand there is no analytical crite rion for assessing the long term stability of multi planet systems 2 planets like that for two planet systems gladman 1993 chambers et al 1996 chambers et al 1996 smith lissauer 2009 lissauer et al 2011 and similar numerical studies have found that long term stability of multi planet systems typically requires the mutual separations between planets to be at least ten mutual hill radii which is much larger than the cautious limit of 2 3 mutual hill radii required by the hill stability criterion that is implemented in our ttv inversion code gladman 1993 chambers et al 1996 meanwhile these criteria are only valid under the assumptions of low mutual inclinations and small ec centricities these two restrictions are usually not well defined limiting values of 1 2 and e 0 1 0 2 respectively are often adopted petrovich 2015 macdonald et al 2016 apparently these restrictions and stability criteria are well satisfied by the nominal orbital architecture of the kepler 411 system inverted from the ttv data on the other hand the hill criterion provides no information about the long term behavior of the system and repeated weak interactions between planets in hill stable orbits may still lead to ejections and or physical collisions these are referred to as lagrange unstable petrovich 2015 the chaotic orbits that are generated primarily by first order or higher order resonance overlap are eventually subjected to large scale varia tion of the semi major axes and hence become lagrange unsta ble based on previous studies on the chaotic behavior induced by the first order resonance overlap e g wisdom 1980 dun can et al 1989 deck et al 2013 supply the condition that leads to chaotic behavior in a two planet system see eq 50 in deck et al 2013 we apply this criterion to estimate the nominal orbital architecture extracted from the ttv data of the kepler 411 system and find that the orbital configuration is far away from the chaotic motion therefore we conclude that the nominal orbital architecture of the kepler 411 system extracted from measured ttvs satisfies both the hill and lagrange stabil ity criteria 4 2 2 stability analysis using numerical dynamical simulation after completing the inversion of ttvs we obtain the con figuration of the kepler 411 system at the reference time i e bjdt db 2454833 130 using these as initial conditions we carry out simulations to evaluate the long term dynamics of the system ttvfast is useful for carrying out short term sim ulations of planetary systems such as for the baseline of the kepler observations i e several years while general relativity and tidal effects are not included in the code deck et al 2014 these effects however can become important on timescales be yond 1 myr in order to meet our requirements we employ another pub licly available n body package rebound which uses the wisdom holman symplectic integrator whfast rein liu 2012 rein tamayo 2015 2017 to evolve the system for 1 myr we note that these integrations are not intended to pro vide a comprehensive overview of the dynamics of the plane tary system but are merely used to check whether the system can remain stable for at least 1 myr in these simulations the stellar mass is fixed to 0 87 m and the integration step is set to 0 15 days roughly 0 05 times the orbital period of the in nermost planet we obtain the initial semi major axis for each planet from its period using kepler s third law with the excep tion of orbital semi major axis the initial conditions for the other jacobi orbital elements such as the eccentricity e the inclination i the longitude of ascending node the argument of periastron and the mean anomaly m are fixed to the values derived from the ttv inversions so as to improve the efficiency of the simula tions this choice is made because the primary determinants are the mutual distances of the planets for the long term stability of the system with low eccentricities 0 2 and mutual inclinations 2 we draw 100 initial values for the semi major axis from a normal distribution n a 0 a where a 0 represents the nominal value obtained from the ttv inversion and a the spread in the semi major axis which is estimated using monte carlo simula tions which include the uncertainties in the mass of the host star the planetary masses and the orbital periods we classify stable planetary systems as those in which the minimum distance between the planets never violates the hill stability criterion during the simulations since the systems that violate the criterion tend to be short lived due to close planet planet encounters gladman 1993 in addition we also require the variations in the semi major axes to be smaller than 10 in cases where a planet is ejected from the system or collisions occur with the star among all simulations the majority 60 remain stable beyond 1 myr 5 discussion 5 1 the possibility that kepler 411 e is on a very eccentric and inclined orbit the constraint of mutual inclination in section 4 1 2 mainly comes from considerations of the long term stability and less significant tdv signals of the kepler 411 system if we hypoth esize that the system is similar to most kepler compact multi planet systems nesvorn 2009 finds that orbits with mutual inclinations 30 are violently unstable in the most compact planetary systems for the kepler 108 system the mutual incli nation of roughly 24 triggers significant ttv and tdv signals on the near 4 1 orbital architectures mills fabrycky 2017 therefore in order to efficiently implement the ttv inversion of kepler 411 d we explicitly set the upper limit of mutual in clination to 30 however if the perturber is on a wider orbit that is different from most kepler compact orbital architecture this kind of orbital architecture even with larger eccentricity and mu tual inclination will probably be stable in the long term and will likely not trigger large tdv signals on the baseline of primary kepler observations in addition this kind of orbital architecture can also probably induce large ttv signals on kepler 411 d due the fact that the mechanism involved is different from the mmr for example as the distance of the perturber changes due to its eccentricity the orbital period of the perturbed planet changes see agol et al 2005 most importantly the period of ttvs induced by a perturber on a very eccentric and wide orbit is ap proximately equal to the orbital period of the perturber agol et al 2005 we study the possibility that kepler 411 e is on a very ec centric and inclined orbit firstly we analyze the period of the ttvs of kepler 411 d using the periodogram tool and find that the power of the periodogram exhibits an apparent peak on the article number page 5 of 11 a a proofs manuscript no 34275 corr final two column period of about 918 1 5 days this period should be very close to the orbital period of the perturber if the ttvs of kepler 411 d are induced by a massive perturber with an eccentric wide orbit architecture secondly we set the upper limits of eccentricity and mutual inclination of the perturber to 0 9 and 30 respectively the upper limit of the eccentricity of kepler 411 d is set to 0 5 however in order to maintain the long term stability of the inner three planets in addition we search for the orbital period of the perturber in the interval between 908 and 928 days and for the masses of both kepler 411 d and the perturber between 0 1 m and 15 mjup finally we find that this kind of orbital architecture cannot accurately reproduce the ttvs of kepler 411 d there fore we confirm that the orbital architecture of ppert 31 5 days is the optimal solution for the ttvs of kepler 411 d 5 2 possible influence of the stellar companion of kepler 411 although the planetary nature of kepler 411 b and kepler 411 c have been confirmed by morton et al 2016 and wang et al 2014 the status of the third candidate kepler 411 d is still ambiguous adaptive optics and speckle imaging observations indicate a low false positive rate for kepler 411 d and also sug gest that no other stellar companion is present in addition to the one already known law et al 2014 wang et al 2015 furlan et al 2017 in this section we consider the possibility that kepler 411 d orbits the companion instead of kepler 411 itself the kepler band differential magnitude between kepler 411 and its companion is roughly 3 0 mag derived using the val ues and empirical relations of wang et al 2015 and furlan et al 2017 we convert this differential magnitude into a flux ratio fa fb 15 85 where fa and fb denote the fluxes of kepler 411 and its stellar companion respectively to test this hypothesis we assume that the transit signals of kepler 411 d originate from the companion which is eclipsed by another body these hypthetical eclipse signals are diluted by the flux of kepler 411 we employed stmt to fit the short cadence transit light curves of kepler 411 d fixing the dilution factor to 15 85 i e the flux ratio the 2 of best fit is 20369 subse quently we adopt the same procedure to fit the same data but now fixing the dilution factor to 1 15 85 we note that the dilu tion of the companion to the transit light curves of kepler 411 is negligible in this case the 2 is now 20286 under the assump tion that kepler 411 d orbits kepler 411 the second hypothe sis leads to a much better fit to the data than the first finally we adopt the bayesian information criterion bic schwarz 1987 proven to be very useful for model selection to com pare both hypotheses we derive a bic of 83 which strongly supports the second hypothesis this means that based on the bayesian statistics theory i e approximately estimated by using exp bic 2 0 the false positive probability of the hypothesis that kepler 411 d orbits kepler 411 is about 9 4 10 19 we have demonstrated that the addition of planet kepler 411 e is indispensable to reproduce the measured ttvs of kepler 411 d furthermore the orbital period ratio of kepler 411 c and kepler 411 e is in the vicinity of four which implies that there is a chance of detecting the influence of kepler 411 e in the ttvs of kepler 411 c if the two planets belong to the same system we compare the fit results of the ttvs of kepler 411 b and kepler 411 c based on a two planet architecture and a four planet one respectively for the two planet architecture the minimum 2 of the ttv fitting of kepler 411 b and kepler 411 c is equal to 972 for the four planet system the minimum 2 of the ttv fittings of both planets decreases to 854 by considering the gravitational perturbations of kepler 411 e to kepler 411 c we still use the bic to complete the model selection between these two orbital configurations the bic value for the two planet model is much larger than that for the four planet one i e bic 81 such a large bic is in favor of both planets d and e orbiting kepler 411 the presence of a wide orbit stellar companion around kepler 411 may produce ttv signals and can influence the dy namical stability of the kepler 411 planetary system here we discuss these possibilities the possibility of the large ttvs of kepler 411 d being due to the stellar companion can easily be ruled out based on three different ttv amplitudes of the tran siting planets of kepler 411 the ttv signals induced by the stellar companion of kepler 411 are primarily due to the light travel effect that is the time delay or advance owing to the reflex motion of the kepler 411 system induced by the companion ir win 1952 agol et al 2005 borkovits et al 2016 therefore all the planetary companions of kepler 411 should exhibit rela tively large ttvs and we have not considered the stellar com panion as the potential perturber during our ttv inversion the gravitational perturbations on the kepler 411 planetary system due to the wide orbit companion are negligible and do not influence their dynamical stability wang et al 2015 es timated the separation of the companion to kepler 411 to be 600 au and the mass of the stellar companion to be 0 13 m assuming physical association the corresponding orbital period of the companion is then roughly 15 000 years if we assume that the semi major axis is equal to the projected separation the gravitational perturbation to the kepler 411 system is therefore most likely negligible and should not significantly change the re sults of long term dynamical simulations even if the stellar com panion is actually physically related to the kepler 411 system therefore we have not included the stellar companion in long term dynamical simulations 5 3 constraints on the compositions of the transiting planets of kepler 411 before analyzing the bulk compositions we estimate the age of the kepler 411 system according to the gyrochronological re lation of barnes 2007 see their eq 2 we estimate an age of 212 31 myr based on the color index the rotation period of kepler 411 and the systematic uncertainty in the relation we can therefore make the reasonable assumption that the gy rochronological age of the host star kepler 411 is equal to that of the planetary system in addition to the age the incident stellar flux also affects the radii of gaseous and h he enriched planets according to the interior structure and thermal evolution models of fortney et al 2007 and lopez fortney 2014 in order to directly compare with these models we derive the scaled orbital separations and incident fluxes of the transiting planets of kepler 411 relative to those of the earth following the expressions in fortney et al 2007 the respective scaled separations for kepler 411 b d are 0 048 0 004 au 0 095 0 008 au and 0 358 0 029 au and the corresponding incident fluxes are 412 71 114 18 and 7 9 1 3 times what the present day earth receives from the sun we show the mass radius diagram in fig 9 which includes the transiting planets of kepler 411 and some transiting planets with precisely measured masses and radii obtained from the ex trasolar planets encyclopaedia 3 the model of solid planets i e 3 www exoplanet eu article number page 6 of 11 leilei sun et al kepler 411 a four planet system with an active host star pure iron rocky and water ice planet is obtained from table 2 of zeng et al 2016 the cold hydrogen model and the 10 h he envelope model are obtained from seager et al 2007 and fortney et al 2007 respectively according to the expression in zeng et al 2016 we find that the sub neptune sized planet kepler 411 b contains a 21 21 mass fraction of iron core with a rocky mantle for kepler 411 c and kepler 411 d however the analysis is more complicated than that of the solid planets this is because the radius of a h he enriched planet depends on many variables such as age incident stellar flux the h he envelope mass frac tion and even the composition of the heavy element core fort ney et al 2007 lopez fortney 2014 nevertheless lopez fortney 2014 show that the h he envelope fraction plays a cru cial role in determining the radius of a sub neptune planet on the mass radius diagram see fig 9 we find that kepler 411 c is adjacent to the region of planets with a 10 h he envelope also the two solar system ice giants uranus and neptune are located near the position related to this model therefore just like uranus and neptune kepler 411 c should have a low density h he envelope in order to be consistent with our mass and ra dius measurements but with most of the mass of the planet in the dense core however the model with a 10 h he envelope is calcu lated under the assumption that a planet contains a 50 50 ice rock core and receives the incident flux identical to that of the present day earth and these assumptions are not applicable to kepler 411 c in order to derive an appropriate model for kepler 411 c and kepler 411 d we linearly interpolate the model radii of the h he enriched planets with a 25 m and 10 m ice rock core at an age of 300 myr respectively in table 2 of fortney et al 2007 whose irradiations are 100 times higher than that of the present day earth we derive rock ice cores with masses of 24 2 4 8 m and 14 4 4 4 m for kepler 411 c and kepler 411 d respectively which corresponds to h he envelope fractions of 8 3 and 5 2 using the models of lopez fortney 2014 we find that if the interior has an earth like composition with an iron core and a rocky mantle the h he envelopes around kepler 411 c and kepler 411 d should have mass fractions of 4 7 and 1 7 respectively 6 summary we investigate the orbital and physical properties of the kepler 411 planetary system we combine kepler photometry data and new ttv measurements from all kepler quarters with previous adaptive optics speckle imaging and dynamical simulation re sults based on the initial conditions extracted from measured ttv signals we carry out a series of long term dynamical sim ulations and find that most simulations remain stable beyond 1 myr our finding can be summarized as follows 1 we obtain a mass of 25 6 2 6 m for kepler 411 b and a mass of 26 4 5 9 m for kepler 411 c 2 we confirm the planetary nature of the previously known ex oplanet candidate koi 1781 03 now known as kepler 411 d and find its mass to be 15 2 5 1 m 3 by assuming a near coplanar system mutual inclination re stricted 30 we have also discovered a nontransiting ex oplanet kepler 411 e with a mass of 10 8 1 1 m on a 31 5 day orbit this planet shows evidence of dynamical interac tion with kepler 411 d 4 with the newly measured masses and radii we confirm that kepler 411 c and kepler 411 d belong to the group of planets with a massive core and a significant fraction of volatiles al though kepler 411 b possesses a sub neptune size it belongs to the group of rocky planets kepler 411 is a slight bright host star v 12 3 mag which makes the planetary system a promising target for follow up spectroscopic observations the rv semi amplitudes of the host star reach up to 12 m s 1 and 9 m s 1 respectively induced by kepler 411 b and c and both are on short period orbits porb 10 days the rv measurements which are independent of the ttv technique can provide more constraints on both masses and or bital eccentricities of the planets of kepler 411 although the presence of strong magnetic activity of the host star makes the characterization of the kepler 411 system using the rv tech nique less feasible the tess mission provides an excellent op portunity to resolve this problem the tess mission will supply continuous high precision photometric data for the kepler 411 system covering at least 27 days if sufficient high precision rv measurements rv 1 m s 1 were obtained with tess pho tometery simultaneously by employing a state of the art high precision velocimeter such as harps or carmenes and so on the stellar activity induced rv variations could be appropri ately modeled there is also a chance that the rv signal of the newly discovered nontransiting planet kepler 411 e i e the rv semi amplitude ke 2 m s 1 could be detected tuomi et al 2014 dumusque et al 2015 barnes et al 2017 jones et al 2017 oshagh 2018 acknowledgements
