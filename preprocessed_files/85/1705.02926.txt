finzell 2 justin d linford 2 jay strader 2 submitted to the astrophysical journal abstract previously nova puppis 1991 v 351 pup was measured to host one of the most massive ejections claimed in the literature multi frequency radio detections from one epoch were published for this nova in the 1990 s and yet the remaining data collected by the karl g jansky very large array vla have remained unpublished in this paper we analyze the remaining unpublished data sets for v 351 pup at frequencies of 4 9 8 4 14 9 and 22 5 ghz we fit the resulting light curve to a model of expanding thermal ejecta under the assumption that the radio emission is dominated by free free radiation and accounting for high levels of clumping in the ejecta images of v 351 pup in both the radio from the vla and h n ii from hubble space telescope exhibit no aspherical structure strengthening our assumption of spherical symmetry from expansion parallax methods we estimate the distance to v 351 pup to be 5 0 1 5 kpc our light curve fit yields a value of log 10 mej 5 2 0 7 m for the ejecta mass implying that v 351 pup is on the low end of expectations for ejecta mass from classical novae a comparison between our derived ejecta mass and theoretical models gives evidence for a very massive 1 25 m white dwarf which is consistent with spectroscopic evidence for an oxygen neon white dwarf keywords white dwarfs novae cataclysmic variables radio continuum stars stars individual v 351 pup binaries close 1 introduction a classical nova outburst is a thermonuclear runaway that occurs on the surface of a white dwarf wd in a close binary the roche lobe filling secondary transfers hydrogen rich gas to its companion wd via an accre tion disk gallagher starrfield 1976 the accreted material gradually forms layers of fuel as it falls onto the surface of the wd the resulting layers are com pressed and heated by the strong surface gravity of the wd starrfield et al 2008 the more massive the wd the smaller its radius and surface area and less accreted mass is needed to reach to the pressure and density re quired for a tnr yaron et al 2005 the thermonuclear runaway begins when the bottom of the accreted layers reaches 10 million k which corresponds to the crit ical pressure and temperature sufficient for cno cycle burning of hydrogen prialnik 1986 the thermonuclear flash powers an optically thick wind that ejects nearly all of the accreted material starrfield et al 2000 the eruption ejects matter on the order of 10 7 to 10 3 m at velocities ranging from hundreds to thousands of km s 1 gehrz et al 1998 yaron et al 2005 unlike a type ia supernova the wd is not de stroyed during the outburst and can continue to accrete material from its companion after eruption as long as accretion continues all novae are expected to recur on timescales from 108 years to less than a year e g yaron et al 2005 properties of the binary star system such as the wd mass and accretion rate from the companion

starrfield et al 1998 2000 roy et al 2012 nova puppis 1991 v 351 pup was discovered in out burst after optical maximum on 1991 december 27 camilleri et al 1992 while saizar et al 1996 sug gested its companion might be a red giant the 2 8 hr orbital period is more consistent with a main sequence donor woudt warner 2001 it was a relatively fast nova with t 2 the time for the optical light curve to de cline by two magnitudes estimated to be between 10 and 16 days pachoulakis saizar 1995 saizar et al 1996 downes duerbeck 2000 abundance estimates from uv optical spectroscopy imply that the primary was an one type wd saizar et al 1996 published estimates for the distance to the nova range from 2 7 4 7 kpc hjellming 1996 orio et al 1996 saizar et al 1996 downes duerbeck 2000 measurements for the maxi mum velocity of the expanding shell range from 2500 to 3200 km s 1 della valle et al 1992 sonneborn et al 1992 williams et al 1994 v 351 pup was previously measured by r hjellming to host one of the most massive ejections claimed in the literature hjellming 1996 gehrz et al 1998 seaquist bode 2008 the ejecta mass of v 351 pup was listed to be 1 01 10 3 m from radio frequency observations however the light curve and details of the ejecta mass derivation were not presented so it is difficult to assess ar x iv 1 70 5 02 92 6 v 2 as tr o ph s r 9 m ay 2 01 7 2 them in comparison with our results below hjellming 1996 in contrast saizar et al 1996 reported a shell mass of 2 0 10 7 m based on uv optical spectroscopy a large fraction of this discrepancy is due to hjellm ing s assumption of no clumping in the nova ejecta cor responding to a filling factor of unity while saizar et al 1996 found a volume filling factor of 1 5 10 5 sixteen months after v 351 pup s optical maximum hard x rays were detected by rosat without the ac companiment of a soft x ray component orio et al 1996 these hard x rays in novae are usually thought to come from shocks though in the case of v 351 pup magnetically controlled accretion was proposed as an other possible source mukai ishida 2001 soft ther mal x rays are associated with nuclear burning on the wd sala hernanz 2005 schwarz et al 2011 it has been speculated that the presence of hard x rays from v 351 pup could have been caused by either shocks in the ejected shell or by magnetically controlled accretion onto the wd orio et al 1996 woudt warner 2001 noted that their quiescent optical light curve for v 351 pup has a strong resemblance to the intermediate polar v 1500 cyg which hosted a nova explosion in 1975 the assertion of a magnetic nova was fairly speculative and has yet to be confirmed in this paper we present the radio observations of the 1991 outburst of v 351 pup including a multi frequency light curve and spatially resolved imaging complemented by hubble space telescope hst imag ing of the nova ejecta in 2 we discuss the standard model for radio emission from novae and we present the radio observations of v 351 pup in 3 we present the radio and optical imaging of the nova shell in 4 and use these images to derive a distance via expansion paral lax to v 351 pup we fit the radio light curve in 5 and discuss implications in 6 to conclude in 7 2 radio emission and model fitting 2 1 radio emission observations of novae at radio frequencies give insight into the total ejected mass density profile and the ki netic energy of a nova eruption radio frequencies pri marily trace the warm ionized gas in nova ejecta in most cases the radio emission from novae is dominated by thermal free free emission seaquist bode 2008 radio observations have proven to be beneficial to our understanding of novae because the external and or in ternal extinction by dust is negligible the character istic time scale of radio light curves for nova eruptions is several years after optical maximum the emitting gas remains optically thick at radio wavelengths for a prolonged time causing the maximum radio flux den sity to occur much later in time than optical maximum seaquist bode 2008 at the beginning of the eruption the shell of ejected matter is optically thick and opaque at all radio frequen cies seaquist bode 2008 the emitting surface area expands with the ejecta resulting in an increase in the radio flux the flux density at this early time rise de pends on the distance to the nova the electron tem perature and the expansion velocity of the radio photo sphere seaquist palimaka 1977 hjellming et al 1979 seaquist et al 1980 the photoionization heating of the expanding ejecta by the hot wd maintains the ob served nearly constant warm 104 k plasma during this phase cunningham et al 2015 during this rising phase of the radio light curve the radio spectral index defined as s approaches 2 as expected for optically thick thermal emission seaquist bode 2008 as time passes the expanding shell becomes less dense less optically thick and the radio photosphere lags be hind the expansion of the outer shell boundary seaquist bode 2008 the shell becomes optically thin at higher frequencies first with lower frequencies becom ing optically thin later in time seaquist palimaka 1977 hjellming et al 1979 seaquist et al 1980 when the ejected mass is optically thin at all frequencies the spectral index becomes nearly flat reaching 0 1 seaquist bode 2008 modeling of the thermal bremsstrahlung emission pro vides us with the total ejected mass density profile and the kinetic energy once the ejection speeds of material and distance to the nova are known seaquist bode 2008 furthermore this form of modeling has a weak de pendence on the temperature of the ejecta such model ing of thermal emission from an expanding shell has been used to explain radio light curves from 10 novae in the past seaquist palimaka 1977 hjellming et al 1979 seaquist et al 1980 kwok 1983 roy et al 2012 ra dio light curve model fitting is derived assuming a finite shell undergoing homologous expansion hubble flow a wind with constant velocity and a variable mass loss rate variable wind or a combination of properties between the two models known as the unified model hjellm ing 1996 seaquist bode 2008 the predicted light curves from these models assume a similar density pro file r 2 or r 3 spherical isothermal ejecta and unity filling factor the differences in the models lie in their treatment of the inner boundary of the ejecta which determines how the radio light curve becomes optically thin more recent work has tweaked the geometry of this model with the addition of either bipolar outflows ribeiro et al 2014 or clumping nelson et al 2014 2 2 hubble flow model for mass ejection in this paper we fit the radio light curve of v 351 pup to the hubble flow model because the hubble flow pro duces results similar to the variable wind model but with fewer free parameters the hubble flow model describes a homologously expanding ionized shell where the ve locity gradient increases linearly with radius v r hjellming et al 1979 hjellming 1996 the radio lumi nosity at early times when the shell is optically thick is proportional to r 2 out te where rout is the expanding outer radius of the nova ejecta and the electron tempera ture te is held constant as a function of time and radius seaquist bode 2008 the hubble flow model assumes that the finite shell is ejected at time t 0 with inner and outer radii obeying the following equations rin vin t t 0 rin 0 1 rout vout t t 0 rout 0 2 where rin is the innermost radius at an arbitrary time t rout is the outermost radius at t rin 0 and rout 0 are the initial innermost and outermost radii respectively at t 0 3 vin is the minimum velocity of ejected material and vout is the maximum velocity hjellming 1996 the temper ature of the ejected matter is held constant t 104 k in time and radius during outburst ribeiro et al 2014 the density gradient in these models usually as sumes an inverse square law which corresponds to uni formly distributed mass as a function of expansion ve locity seaquist bode 2008 a density gradient pro portional to an inverse cube law produces similar results seaquist et al 1980 in the case of inverse square dis tribution the ejecta density at an arbitrary radius r between rin and rout is given by r t 1 4 r 2 mej rout t rin t 3 where mej is the total ejected mass seaquist bode 2008 using this analytic form for the evolving density profile makes it fairly straightforward to calculate the radio flux density and opacity using basic numerical in tegration methods seaquist palimaka 1977 hjellming et al 1979 seaquist et al 1980 3 observations and data reduction v 351 pup was observed by the pre upgrade vla at four frequency bands c x u and k bands spanning 4 9 ghz 22 5 ghz following the 1991 nova outburst ra dio observations were obtained by r hjellming between the dates of 1992 march 7 and 1995 january 7 through the programs ah 0390 and ah 0492 the data were cali brated using the absolute flux calibrator 3 c 286 and the complex gain calibrator 0741 063 data were obtained in standard continuum mode with two intermediate fre quencies ifs and 100 mhz bandwidth the raw data were accessed from the nrao archive and were edited calibrated and imaged using standard routines in the astronomical image processing system aips greisen 2003 in every image the flux density of v 351 pup was measured by fitting a gaussian to the imaged source with the task jmfit in aips the result ing multi frequency radio light curve for v 351 pup can be seen in figure 1 for data sets obtained in the a configuration the most extended vla configuration we recorded the integrated flux density of the gaussian while all other configurations held the width of the gaus sian fixed to the dimensions of the synthesized beam measurements are presented in table 1 v 351 pup has j 2000 coordinates of r a 08 h 11 m 38 38 s decl 35 07 30 4 which puts 3 c 286 and 0741 063 at angular separations of 91 and 140 respectively the large angular separation between v 351 pup and the complex gain calibrator had the po tential to cause errors during calibration the effects of these calibrations errors are noted for individual epochs in table 1 with footnotes we added 5 systematic cali bration errors to measurements at 4 9 and 8 4 ghz and 10 for 14 9 and 22 5 ghz an attempt was made to self calibrate every epoch but there was only sufficient signal to noise to successfully self calibrate around the light curve peak day 276 to day 728 poor atmospheric conditions with the data sets on day 300 and the 22 5 ghz band on day 617 led to v 351 pup being fully decorrelated in the resulting images and therefore no flux densities were recorded for that date 10 2 10 3 days since discovery 1991 dec 27 10 0 10 1 10 2 f lu x d e n si ty m jy 4 86 ghz 8 44 ghz 14 94 ghz 22 46 ghz figure 1 multi frequency radio light curve for v 351 pup upper limits are plotted as downward facing triangles all seen at 22 5 ghz the first epoch in which the source was resolved in the radio is indicated by the black arrow see section 4 2 for further details 3 c 286 was not observed as part of data sets on day 72 day 391 and at 22 5 ghz on day 102 however the flux density of the phase calibrator 0741 063 appears stable with time table 1 so we used the flux density measured for 0741 063 on adjacent dates to set the absolute flux scale for these data sets r hjellming previously published results for radio de tections on day 71 he recorded flux densities of 0 5 1 2 and 3 mjy at 4 9 8 4 and 14 9 ghz respectively hjellming 1992 we produced similar results for day 71 with flux densities of 0 43 1 03 and 2 96 mjy corre sponding to the same frequencies the specific procedure for flux calibration used by r hjellming is unknown but we suspect differences in our measurements to be caused by calibration without the flux calibrator 3 c 286 we as sumed a constant flux density for the phase calibrator 0741 063 from the adjacent epoch on day 102 v 351 pup was not significantly detected 3 at 22 5 ghz on days 195 989 and 1107 we suspect that poor weather conditions on day 195 led to low signal to noise for the other two epochs we suspect that the source had faded below the detection threshold in these cases the flux densities at the nova position were measured directly from the images the rms noise levels for these sets were measured with imean in aips the upper limits plot ted in figure 1 and listed in table 1 represent 3 limits three times the noise was added to the flux density mea sured at the nova position and that resulting calculation was plotted as the downward facing triangle upper limit finally the 22 5 ghz observation on day 819 and the 14 9 22 5 ghz data sets from day 875 when the vla was in its extended a configuration resulted in no recorded flux density due to v 351 pup being resolved out of the image the a configuration of the vla provides high resolution and is therefore beneficial for spatially resolved images as discussed in 4 2 the observations from day 819 provided images at 8 4 and 14 9 ghz the radio light curve in figure 1 takes approximately one year to reach maximum as theoretically expected 4 for thermal emission higher frequencies peak earlier and at higher flux densities we note an early bump in the light curve at 115 days after outburst and seen in mul tiple frequencies which is followed by possible substruc ture at later times given the evidence for multiple ejecta events in other nova light curves taylor et al 1987 krauss et al 2011 weston et al 2015 b a these suggest that similar events may have occurred in v 351 pup the large separation between the nova and the complex gain calibrator however makes us wary to interpret smaller scale

observation was calibrated without the flux calibrator 3 c 286 assuming the listed flux density for the phase calibrator derived using the flux measured from adjacent epochs 3 the source did not significantly exceed the noise the quoted value is a 3 upper limit 4 data were partially decorrelated and as a result were self calibrated to recover the full flux density 5 the source was resolved out by the extended array configuration figure 2 shows the behavior of the radio spectral en ergy distribution of v 351 pup as the nova shell expands as previously stated the spectral index is expected to be high when completely optically thick 2 0 and low when optically thin 0 1 v 351 pup s spec tral index peaks at 1 31 0 07 on day 276 days after outburst and remains roughly constant between 0 8 1 2 until day 400 a true spectral index of 2 0 is not often observed in novae and a spectral index of 1 3 is more commonly observed during the early evolution of novae chomiuk et al 2014 nelson et al 2014 the underlying cause of this discrepancy from theoretical expectations is not yet understood the data taken before day 402 can be reasonably fit with a single power law on day 402 v 351 pup begins to show evidence of turnover at high frequencies as the 22 5 ghz band falls below the power law fit to the other frequencies this observation demonstrates that by day 402 the highest frequency photosphere has started to recede back through the nova shell unfortunately there is no clear turnover on day 532 because the vla did not observe v 351 pup at 22 5 ghz by day 728 the radio photosphere has become optically thin at all frequencies yielding a roughly flat spectral index of 0 17 0 07 4 imaging of v 351 pup 4 1 optical imaging pictured in figure 3 is an optical narrow band image of v 351 pup taken with the hst on 1998 february 14 day 2 240 the image was taken on the pc chip of the wfpc 2 camera with the f 656 n filter and an exposure time of 320 s the f 656 n filter covers h and the n ii 6548 a and 6584 a lines the shell of ejected matter can be seen as a circularly symmetric ring of material surrounding the wd star we note that this image was considered in downes duerbeck 2000 for distance calculations but was not pictured therein to measure the diameter of the nova shell we took an image slice across the shell s center intersecting the white dwarf point source of 1 pixel width along this image slice the shell was visible as a flux peak on either side of the point source we fit gaussians to these max ima using the curve fit function in the

position angle of 5 6 at 8 4 ghz the synthesized beam measures 0 55 0 20 with a position angle of 2 6 v 351 pup is clearly less resolved at 8 4 ghz compared to 14 9 ghz to determine the size and level of asymmetry of the radio image we modeled the calibrated u v data corre sponding to the images in figure 4 with difmap shep herd et al 1994 both circular and elliptical 2 d gaus sian components were fit to the 8 4 and 14 9 ghz data sets we find that both models yield very similar residu als results can be seen in table 2 while the elliptical models contain slightly more flux and have slightly lower 2 values than the circular model the difference is not significant we conclude that the radio images of v 351 pup are consistent with a circular geometry of diameter 0 47 observed 819 days after nova explosion the hubble flow model and most published model ing of novae at radio bands assumes spherical geometry ribeiro et al 2014 showed that departures from spher ical symmetry i e bipolar ejecta morphologies can sig nificantly affect the radio light curve they demonstrate that a faulty assumption of spherical symmetry when the ejecta are instead bipolar can lead to an overesti mate of the ejecta mass by a factor of 2 such com plications do not appear to be relevant for v 351 pup however as shown by both the radio and hst imaging v 351 pup shows no significant departures from spherical symmetry 4 3 distance via expansion parallax spherical symmetry in v 351 pup also enables a rel atively simple derivation of the distance using the ex 7 figure 3 f 658 n image of v 351 pup taken with hst on 1998 february 14 the extent of v 351 pup s circularly symmetric ejected shell is indicated by the red circle the diameter of the circular ring is 1 2 0 1 the field of view is 2 7 2 3

by day 819 the time of our imaging as can be seen by the flat radio spectrum measured on day 728 figure 2 therefore caution must be exhibited in us ing these observations to find a distance using the expan sion parallax because the outer less dense ejecta corre sponding to the fastest velocities could be faint and be low the sensitivity limit of our imaging however these concerns are assuaged by the fact that very similar di ameters are measured at both 14 9 and 8 4 ghz despite rather different sensitivities and resolutions we there fore conclude that we are sensitive to the outer edges of the nova ejecta and their diameter is 0 47 the radial expansion rate for the radio images was therefore found to be 0 105 arcsec yr 1 the expansion rate for the h n ii image was measured to be 0 097 arcsec yr 1 although we expect to first order that the h n ii and radio imaging trace the same warm ion ized gas the dramatically different observing epochs and sensitivity might allow one to be more sensitive to the outermost low density ejecta than the other it is there fore remarkable that the radio and hst expansion rates agree so well with one another for the following expan sion parallax calculation we take the radio determined expansion rate as it was determined earlier and repre sents faster expansion and therefore more likely traces the outermost ejecta these angular expansion rates should be compared to the maximum ejecta velocities determined from spec troscopy to determine an expansion parallax distance we take the maximum velocity of the expanding shell to be 2500 km s 1 as measured from the full width at zero intensity fwzi of the balmer lines sonneborn et al 1992 williams et al 1994 faster expansion velocities were measured for the mg ii line but the balmer lines are most directly comparable to the thermal free free radio emission using equation 1 from linford et al 2015 we therefore estimate a distance to v 351 pup of 5 0 kpc by far the largest uncertainty in this calculation is the physical velocity downes duerbeck 2000 used the hst image shown in 4 1 and assumed typical i e mean ejecta velocities of 1200 2000 km s 1 based off the work of pachoulakis saizar 1995 and sonneborn et al 1992 while they calculated a very similar angu lar expansion velocity as we find here 0 100 arcsec yr 1 they derived a distance in the range of 2 7 4 0 kpc we estimate a 30 error in the physical expansion velocity corresponding to our radio and hst images i e 2500 750 km s 1 therefore implying a distance and uncer tainty of 5 0 1 5 kpc saizar et al 1996 published a few additional distance estimates based on independent techniques they de rived a distance from ultraviolet data assuming v 351 pup is observed during a phase of constant bolometric luminosity near eddington they estimate 2 4 3 0 kpc this estimate falls 1 6 from our distance determina tion and would be very susceptible to foreground redden ing saizar et al 1996 also consider distance estimates based off the maximum magnitude rate of decline rela tionship but we neglect those here based on the work of kasliwal et al 2011 and cao et al 2012 which brings 8 figure 4 radio imaging taken 819 days after outburst 1994 march 25 at two different frequencies 14 9 ghz left panel and 8 4 ghz right panel the synthesized beam is pictured as a white ellipse in the top right in each panel the field of

the relationship into question 5 light curve modeling the standard hubble flow model can be applied to our light curve in order to estimate the ejecta mass for v 351 pup the multi frequency light curves for v 351 pup were fit with the standard hubble flow model via 2 minimization fitting 3 detections at all four fre quencies and all times simultaneously the model fit assumed that the instant of mass ejection was simulta neous with the optical discovery date on 1991 december 27 camilleri et al 1992 we incorporate within our model physical parameters that have previously been derived in the literature the electron temperatures were derived by saizar et al 1996 from the flux ratios of optical and ultraviolet emission lines for nitrogen stickland et al 1981 wilkes et al 1981 saizar et al 1996 measurements were taken be tween 136 and 484 days after outburst and show no ev idence for a significant temperature change over time they are always consistent with 104 k which we take as the electron temperature in our model saizar et al 1996 calculated volume filling factors that are on the order of 10 5 by measuring the electron density using o iii line ratios assuming the electron temperature as described above and compar ing them with estimates of the emission measure density 2 determined from hydrogen recombination lines filling factors were calculated for dates between 370 and 484 days after outburst and remain consistent around 10 5 the derived mass of the ejecta depends on the filling factor to the power of 0 5 heywood et al 2005 and on the distance to the power of 2 5 hjellming et al 1979 based on our estimates in 4 3 we assume a distance of 5 0 1 5 kpc a 30 error in addition the filling factor is known to be good to one order of magnitude saizar et al 1996 given the large uncertainty in our distance and the filling factor we varied these parameters to find a range for our ejecta mass to find an average value of the mass ejecta we assumed a distance of 5 kpc and a filling factor of 10 5 for the minimum mass ejecta we assumed a distance of 3 5 kpc and a filling factor of 10 6 and for the maximum mass ejecta we assumed a distance of 6 5 kpc and a filling factor of 10 4 model fits to each frequency are seen in figure 5 our model fits for the expanding isothermal shell of free free emitting gas fits three primary components of the light curve these components include the total bright ness the amount of time it takes for the gas to become optically thin and the speed with which it becomes opti cally thin minimization of 2 between our data and the hubble flow model results in the model fit seen as the solid line the maximum velocity of the ejecta from this model fit was calculated to be 3000 km s 1 and the ratio of velocities of the inner and outer end of the ejected ma terial was calculated to be 0 74 the mass of ejecta was calculated to be log 10 mej 5 2 0 7 m as pointed out above the mass of the shell is proportional to distance 5 2 while the maximum velocity depends lin early on distance if v 351 pup is at 2 5 kpc rather than 5 kpc our estimates of ejecta mass would decrease to 18 of those listed above i e 0 9 1 3 10 6 m our model fit while not formally acceptable was op timized at a 2 of 2074 8 65 or a reduced 2 of 31 9 model fits to multiple frequency light curves essentially always return reduced 2 values greater than 1 illustrat ing that the simple hubble flow model is not completely sufficient to describe our data e g nelson et al 2014 weston et al 2016 finzell et al 2017 still it is out side the scope of this work to develop a model that can completely describe the radio light curve which would need to be more complex in a similar manner to how we calculated the diameter of the nova shell in 4 1 we were able to measure at the time of our hst image day 2 240 rout was calculated by adding two times the standard deviation to the differ ence in mean values along each image slice and rin was calculated by subtracting two times the standard devi ation to the difference in mean values along each image slice we measured our ratio of rin to rout also known as to be 0 45 0 03 6 discussion plotted in figure

wd mass in the range of 1 25 m which is consistent with spectro scopic evidence for an oxygen neon white dwarf saizar et al 1996 previously r hjellming measured the mass of v 351 pup to be 1 01 10 3 m under the assumption of uni form density ejecta r hjellming assumed a maximum velocity of the expanding shell to be 2500 km s 1 and a distance of 4 1 kpc hjellming 1996 holding hjellm ing s parameters fixed we find that this model produces a significantly worse fit than the model we present here this can be quantified by 2 statistics of how far his model deviants from the data these parameters fit the data poorly with a 2 of 6541 0 65 or a reduced 2 of 100 6 this value of 2 is roughly a factor of 3 2 worse than either of the best fit models we were able to produce the parameters r hjellming used produced a model that was not reaching high enough peak flux levels and declined too slowly with respect to our light curve the estimate from our model fitting that incorporated clumping and errors in distance places v 351 pup s ejecta at a mass of log 10 mej 5 2 0 7 m it is worth noting that a non unity filling factor does not change the shape of the radio light curve it only changes the ejecta mass that corresponds to a particular light curve mej 1 2 nelson et al 2014 if we assumed a fill ing factor of 1 the best fit ejecta mass described above would become 1 48 10 3 which is on the same order of magnitude as the ejecta mass derived by r hjellming with clumping the ejecta of v 351 pup have gone from being one of the most massive ejections reported in the literature to several orders of magnitude smaller and are now consistent with nova model predictions figure 6 incorporating non uniform filling factors into other ob served radio light curves has the potential to fix the

to be 1 01 10 3 m under the assumption of uniform density ejecta shown as one of the light gray circles the best fit estimate from our model fitting that incorporated clumping places v 351 pup at a

fit of expanding thermal ejecta held the assumption of spherical symmetry and an analysis of both radio and h n ii images of v 351 pup revealed no aspherical structure the mass of the ejecta was estimated to be log 10 mej 5 2 0 7 m previously v 351 pup was published as one of the most massive ejections but the incorporation of a filling factor of 10 5 into our model now places v 351 pup on the low end of expectations for ejecta mass from classical novae and brings its observa tional properties in line with theoretical predictions c w would like to thank the department of physics and
