the next generation of ex tremely large telescopes however modern earth based astronomy has gone through a process of concentration on few sites with exceptional sky quality resulting in those becoming more and more crowded the future lgs systems encounter hence an envir onment of surrounding astronomical installations some of which observing with large fields of view we derive formulae to calculate the impact of lgs light on the cam era of a neighbouring telescope and the probabilities for a laser crossing the camera field of view to occur and apply these to the specific case of the next very high energy gamma ray observatory cherenkov telescope array cta its southern part shall be constructed in a valley of the cerro armazones chile close to the very large telescope vlt and the european extremely large telescope elt while its northern part will be located at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos on the canary island of la palma which also hosts the gran telescopio de canarias gtc and serves as an optional site for the thirty meter telescope tmt both employing lgs systems although finding the artificial star in the field of view of a cta telescope will not disturb observations considerably the laser beam crossing the field of view of a cta telescope may be critical we find no conflict expected for the elt lasers however 1 3 of extra galactic and 1 5 of galactic

island of la palma spain and of the southern cta site cta s right at the eso site of cerro armazones chile the planned disposition of cta telescopes is shown together with the locations of the existing vlt and gtc telescopes the elt under construction as well as the possible location of the tmt distances from the optical telescopes to the closest cta telescopes are marked the underground map has been obtained with openstreetmap org and the cta layout from www cta observatory org creation of several guide stars is also possible to achieve asterism with a radial distance from science target ranging from 0 5 to 6 on the sky the lgs will likely be operated regularly during observations and their scattered light rayleigh and mie will then be seen by other telescopes until distances of several kilometers from the location of their host observatory assuming the close by installation observes in a wavelength range enclosing that of the lgs lasers the scattered laser light may then leave spurious light tracks on the cameras and affect operation in several ways a by generating false triggers for installations which trigger image readout e g from cherenkov light pulses the star guider camera and the precision pointing of the telescopes and ultimately d by affecting the duty cycle if active laser avoidance is chosen several of the enumerated problems can be often overcome with the use of notch filters schallenberg et al 2010 or band pass filters ahnen et al 2017 archambault et al 2017 however this is not always possible at a reasonable cost particularly not in the case of the cta where every camera pixel would need to be covered by such a filter light losses at smaller wavelengths particularly in the sensitive region from 300 nm to 500 nm need to be strictly controlled in order to ensure that sensitivity losses remain acceptable particularly around the energy threshold of the cta it is therefore important to compute the amount of light that can reach a neighbouring installation as well as to discuss the probability of interferences the latter depends on the angular separation between the direction of the lasers and the telescopes optical axis the distance to the crossing point and its altitude the size of the collecting surface of the telescopes and the photon detection efficiency pde of the photo sensors the goal of this study is that to provide a reference formalism to address this twofold interference spurious light yield and probability of crossings this is done through the paper with a general approach but is quantified for the particular case of the oncoming cherenkov telescope array cta cta actis et al 2011 will be an observatory for gamma ray astronomy in the gev tev energy range it is based on the so called imaging atmospheric cherenkov technique iact that captures the cherenkov light emitted by extensive air showers eas produced when very high energy gamma rays hit the earth s atmosphere the eas is a cascade of a large number of sub atomic particles mainly electrons and positrons which reaches a maximum at altitudes between 8 12 km a s l for a 1 tev shower on average however moving to considerably higher altitudes at lower energies the relativistic particles forming the cascade emit cherenkov light which propagates towards the ground the cherenkov light emission is strongest in the ultraviolet and blue hence the cta telescopes and cameras are optimized to a wavelength range from 300 nm to 500 nm but are also sensitive in the green and even yellow part of the optical spectrum silicon photomultiplier based cameras may even extend sensitivity beyond 900 nm otte et al 2017 cta will operate at two sites one in the northern hemisphere at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos orm la palma spain and one in the southern hemisphere at a chilean site of the european southern observatory eso close to paranal the northern array hereafter cta n has been formally accepted and

under construction the northern array is somewhat smaller covering an area of about 500 600 m between the current orm residence and the higher altitude rim of the caldera de taburiente mountain which hosts several optical telescopes in between the gran telescopio de canarias gtc 4 located at 28 762 n 17 892 w is found at about 550 m from the center of the cta n further in that direction at a distance of 1150 m from the center of the cta n and located at 28 753 n 17 897 w the thirty meter telescope tmt 5 may be installed if finally the orm is chosen to host it because the mst and sst telescopes are wider distributed around the central lsts several of them will in some cases further approach the vlt or elt at the cta s or the gtc or tmt at the cta n see figure 1 for a schematic

2011 have been built as well but are not a primary option for the extremely large telescopes the lgs lasers will operate till elevations of as low as 20 and could therefore cross the view cone of some of the telescopes of the cta the paper is structured as follows in section 2 we compute the amount of lgs induced light on a generic camera receiver unit pixel at the position of a putative neighbouring instrument in section 3 we estimate the probabilities that the lgs laser light beams cross the field of view of a neighbouring instrument and impede re positioning in section 4 we quantify the two effects for the realistic case of cta telescopes in each hemisphere and the planned close by lgs facilities in section 5 we discuss the results and conclude there follow some appendices for the derivation of several larger formulae 2 computation of ao laser induced light on neighbouring installations throughout this section the number of photons produced in photon detection systems of another instrument far from the lgs system is computed quantitative numbers are computed for the cta however the formulae are kept as general as possible and can be applied to any similar case the main parameters of the lgs systems of vlt elt gtc and tmt used for this study are reported in table 1 together with their closest distance to cta telescopes and altitude differences

table 1 characteristics of the ao laser systems of the gtc tmt vlt and elt telescopes and distances compared to cta telescopes 2 1 scattering of the laser light in the lower atmosphere light of wavelength and polarization angle is scattered in the atmosphere by air molecules through rayleigh scattering and aerosols through mie scattering or even more complicated ways if the shape of the scattering aerosols is not radially symmetric dubovik et al 2006 in dry air light is elastically 7 scattered by air molecules at a scattering angle with respect to the impinging photon direction into

only on the components mixture of air which can be assumed constant throughout the troposphere and in time except for the negligible contribution of co 2 one can hence pick a reference condition for

anisotropy of air and amounts to about 1 048 at 589 nm tomasi et al 2005 the factors 2 2 2 1 01 and 1 1 0 95 describe the chandrasekhar correction bucholtz 1995 chandrasekhar 1950 after multiplying with the number density of molecules at a given altitude h we obtain the volume scattering coefficient mol h see also gaug 2014 mol 589 2 nm h 1 0 10 6 0 95 cos 2 cos 2 sin 2 n h ns m 1 sr 1 1 0 10 6

to estimate the dependency of n h ns on altitude we use a typical atmospheric winter condition at the orm 8 gaug et al 2017 with n h ns f h exp h hmol 3 where h is the altitude a s l of the scattering point and hmol 9 5 km the average density scale height of the local troposphere 7 additionally raman scattering on nitrogen and oxygen molecules has been observed vogt et al 2017 albeit with intensities more than three orders of magnitude lower than the pure elastically scattered return 8 the main results of this study are however unaffected by this assumption mnras in press 1 24 2018 impact of lgs system on cta 5 9 8 km for the central summer months the function f h reproduces the slight modulation of density in the tropopause and the stratosphere and can be modelled with the

function equation 4 can show variations of more than 10 particularly in the tropopause aerosols scatter light more efficiently than molecules and usually less isotropically due to their larger sizes although they are much less in number density world class astronomical observatories are however characterized by extremely low aerosol contamination on average for instance typical winter nights on la palma show aerosol optical thicknesses aots of the ground layer of the order of only 0 02 at 532 nm with extinction coefficients distributed exponentially with a scale height of around haer 500 m gaug et al 2017 hence htrack 0 532 nm exp htrack haer 5 where 0 532 nm 4 5 10 5 m 1 and htrack is the altitude of the observed part of the laser track above the neighboring telescope at paranal only the aot has been studied so far patat et al 2011 yielding similar results we further assume a typical a ngstro m index in the range from 0 5 1 5 for clear nights see e g entries iza or mlo in fig 3 of andrews et al 2011 and derive 0 589 nm 4 10 5 m 1 for 589 nm as we will later see this number becomes important only on rare occasions we can use the henyey greenstein formula henyey greenstein 1941

environment in the argentinean andes contrary to the rayleigh scattering case on molecules the value of 0 589 nm can show large variations depending on both the amount of aerosols and their composition for instance a layer of saharan dust called calima on la palma can dramatically increase the aerosol scattering cross section lombardi et al 2008 we neither take into acount these nor the possibility of clouds here because their effects are considered more important obstacles for observation by themselves than the scattered laser light finally we neglected any scattering contribution from stratospheric aerosols in the junge layer 10 2 2 computation of spurious lgs light on neighbour installation s pixels we assume that the neighbouring instrument collects light in a pixelated camera e g a ccd camera or an array of photomultiplier tubes or silicon photomultipliers we compute the amount of light observed by a single pixel in the camera and assume that the telescope observes the laser uplink beam under an angle such that if laser and the telescope s optical axis are parallel and 2 if the axes cross perpendicularly see figure 2 the pixel observes a part of the laser track dtrack across its field of view fovpix at a distance d from the laser uplink beam dtrack fovpix d sin blur d 7 where we have included the possibility that the laser beam width w spreads over more than one pixel blur 1 exp 4 r 2 w 2 psf r d 8 here psf is the point spread function of the telescope projected onto the plane perperdicular to the laser propagation and the angular distance from the beam axis we can however assume that the lgs laser is sufficiently well collimated such that the observed beam width fits always into one camera pixel blur 1 which is the case at least for the cta cameras and their neighbouring lgs stations 11 9 obtained from fits to nasa s nrlmsise 00 density profiles https ccmc gsfc nasa gov modelweb models nrlmsise 00 php 10 the current stratospheric aot amounts to 0 005 distributed over an altitude from 15 km to 30 km a s l residual scattered laser light from these altitudes get mostly focused into one camera pixel 11 assuming a beam width of 0 4 m li et al 2016 observed in the absolutely worst case at 150 m see subsection 4 1 distance by an mst yields 2 6 mrad smaller than the mst pixel size of 3 mrad or at 300 m by an lst yields 1 3 mrad smaller than the lst pixel size of 1 7 mrad assuming that the optical aberrations are smaller than the size of a pixel which is the case both mst and ssts produce a point spread of about 0 02 on axis to 0 05 towards the camera edges mnras in press 1 24 2018 https ccmc gsfc nasa gov modelweb models nrlmsise 00 php 6 m gaug et al assuming negligible loss of laser light due to scattering out of the beam the observed photon rate inside one laser s track can be estimated from the total laser power plaser see table 1 rph plaser laser h c nlasers 4 9 1019 s 1 9 where an individual laser power of 16 5 w has been assumed the number of lasers simultaneously fired nlasers ranges from one for the case of the gtc to four in the case of vlt to six in the case of the tmt and the elt if the distance d is large with respect to the camera dimensions which will always be the case during observations at least for the cta the scattering angle can be approximated as constant for all pixels the light of the observed laser track scatters into a solid angle atel d 2 where atel is the telescope s mirror area considering a the mirror reflectivity a transmission factor toptics for the overall optics filters and instrument and a photon detection efficiency pde 589 nm the photo electron rate which is then amplified by the dynodes of the photo multiplier of the camera pixel can be derived as 12 rpix rph

as derived in eqs 2 and 6 with the average reference values for g and f inserted moreover we have included an atmospheric transmission factor tair from the laser light dispersion point to the telescope mirror besides the rather obvious observation that those cameras will be affected most which show the highest combination of the factors toptics fovpix atel pde 589 nm d equation 10 requires the following comments i the distance d to the laser beam reduces the amount of registered light in a linear way this is due to the combination of reduced solid angle which scales with d 2 and the increased part of the track spanned by the fov of a pixel which scales with d due to the one dimensional propagation of the laser beam ii the function 1 cos 2 sin has a divergent maximum at i e when the beam propagates along the telescope s optical axis equation 7 assumes then that the pixel integrates the light beam extending to infinite in the case of such large scattering angles the development of the scattering coefficient across the fov of the pixel needs to be taken into account and equation 7 translates into the geometrical overlap function of the lidar equation fernald et al 1972 as a matter of fact 1 cos 2 sin increases only by a factor four at 0 85 with respect to its minimum at 2 which suggests that equation 10 is at least not valid for viewing angles 0 85 13 in case of observation of a same source by both the lgs equipped and the neighbouring telescope the photo electron rate received by the outmost camera pixel of the neighbouring telescope can be approximated

140 160 m 2 s 1 w 1 of circularly polarized laser light at 589 159 nm to sodium atoms jin et al 2014 lu et al 2016 and a vertical column density of sodium of 3 6 1013 m 2 moussaoui et al 2010 we can derive an average effective volume scattering coefficient of na 1 7 0 6 10 7 1 cos 2 2 25 1 25 sin m 1 13 where denotes the angle between the laser beam propagation and the direction of the earth s magnetic field lines the last factor is valid if 10 of the laser light is used to simultaneously excite the f 1 hyperfine ground state of sodium with 589 157 nm wavelength optical pumping moussaoui et al 2008 the scattering angle dependency stems from the polarization of the laser light steck 2010 eq 13 assumes a constant scattering efficiency throughout the layer which shows in reality complicated structures neichel et al 2013 nevertheless we will use it together with eq 10 to roughly estimate 12 equation 10 has been cross checked with an independent lidar return power simulation program 13 note that such high scattering angles are actually possible if the laser propagates away from the neighboring installation at maximum zenith angle in that case max l htrack cos 2 lgs however in such

results are discussed and computed for the case of the cta but the used formulae are generic and can be adapted to different facilities we assume that an lgs impedes observation of a certain strip in the sky if the photon rate in a series of pixels received by at least one neighbouring instrument s camera becomes larger than a maximally acceptable critical threshold rcrit we first notice that if a laser traffic control system ltcs summers et al 2003 is used in its basic configuration 14 see e g summers et al 2012 currently used for the orm and the paranal observatory the affected sky region can be technically avoided therefore for most of the steady sources the scheduling system can take into account the ltcs information and re schedule a source to later times if necessary the situation is different in case of targets that are either a part of multi wavelength or multi instrument campaigns and therefore observed with pre defined fixed observation times or b that are the result of fast target of opportunity too alerts the former are scheduled well in advance in coordination with other facilities and their scientific merit relies on contemporaneous data taking while the latter are observations motivated by external triggers or other activators demanding immediate reaction and repositioning of the telescopes such as e g gamma ray burst or gravitational wave alerts or generally flaring sources in these cases adequate scheduling of sources is practically impossible without a high risk of losing the science case the frequency of such too alerts the duration of their follow up observations and the further characteristics of the campaigns depend on the specific science case and the specificities of the neighbouring facility nevertheless a general computation of the interference probability is hereafter attempted we start by defining the geometry of the problem in figure 3 an lgs is located at a horizontal distance l of an affected telescope the lgs beam vetoes a band across the sky whose width can be assumed to be the larger fov of that neighbouring instrument this band may cross the observability cone of the close by telescope i e the region of the sky

table 1 the cta telescopes lst mst sst dish sizes and camera pixel fields of view as found in actis et al 2011 are reported in table 220 until very recently photomultiplier tubes pmts have been the common choice for equipping iact cameras due to their large photon detection efficiency pde from 300 to 450 nm large size and fast time response however silicon photomultipliers sipms are emerging as an interesting alternative this rapidly evolving technology has the potential to become superior to that of pmts in terms of pde which would further improve the sensitivity of iacts and provide a price reduction per detector area an example of a working sipm based iact is fact anderhub et al 2013 in cta this choice is already the default for the double mirror schwarzschild couder ssts labelled sst sc in table 2 as well as the single mirror davies cotton sst labelled sst dc in table 2 schwarzschild couder optics demand a compact camera bonanno et al 2016 however the sipm choice was also adopted for the sst dc that makes use of the non commercial hamamatsu s 10943 2832 x heller et al 2017 the mst telescopes will instead host pmt based cameras glicenstein shayduk 2017 using the r 12992 100 pmt from hamamatsu 21 and for the proposed schwarzschild couder mst meagher 2014 at cta s the case of lst is peculiar its baseline design will make use of the pmt hamamatsu r 19200 100 okumura et al 2015 with the four lsts planned for the cta n already being built with pmt cameras however for cta s as well as for a possible upgrade of the cta n cameras the lst consortium is currently investigating an upgrade to sipm rando et al 2016 arcaro et al 2017 in such a case the sipm photon detection efficiency pde at the lgs wavelength would be about four times that of the lst pmt the lst with sipm equipped camera does however not have a technical design implementation plan and is not yet approved a simpler solution could be that of replacing each pmt with an array of sipm matrices joined together in this case the pixel fov will not change different solutions with different pixel sizes and light guides are under discussion and will not be treated here further following their use in equation 10 we combine the effective telescope dish size the pixels field of view and their pde into a new parameter labelled lgs sensitivity shown in the last column of table 2 one can see that the acceptance of laser track light in an lst camera pixel results to be a bit more than or a factor ten higher in the case of a sipm based lst camera that of an mst camera pixel some of the msts however approach the lgs much more than the lsts do because both mst and lst will have very similar or even the same super bialkali photo multipliers at least before a possible upgrade the differences in pde 589 nm should be negligible between both values of pde 589 nm 0 06 0 01 can be expected maximally varying from 5 to 9 see e g mirzoyan et al 2017 toyama et al 2015 on the other hand the sst cameras maccarone 2017 samarai et al 2017 equipped with sipm are very sensitive at 589 nm of the order of 30 billotta et al 2014 otte et al 2017 however some of the current sst designs try to cover the camera with protective windows coated with an optical filter to remove wavelengths longer than 550 nm in order to provide reference numbers illustrating the severity of a laser beam crossing the cta telescopes field of view we have selected two cases scenarios concentrating on the relative direction of laser and telescopes we define i a low severity case expected to happen most frequently among the presented scenarios the cta observes at 30 zenith angle towards the south i e the lgs systems at the orm or the north i e the lgs at the elt whose lasers point vertically upwards and the beams cross see figure 9 left the distance to the laser beam is then always larger than 500 m at the cta n and larger than 30 km at the cta s scattering occurs then at altitudes higher than 500 m in the north and 25 km in the south respectively in this case the scattering angle is 150 degrees and scattering normally dominated by molecules ii a maximal severity case yielding the highest possible impact of the lasers on a cta telescope although this scenario is very unlikely to occur the laser propagates at the minimally allowed elevation exactly towards the cta where the telescopes look into the direction of the laser at 65 elevation see figure 9 right the distance to the laser beam is then as low as 150 m in the case of the closest mst to the gtc laser beam observed at only 130 m altitude above the mst scattering occurs at altitudes ranging from 130 m to 480 m for the closest mst and lst respectively in this case the scattering angle is 90 and scattering of the laser light is likely dominated by aerosols the results of these case scenarios are quantified in table 3 all of the studied cases focus the beam size into one camera pixel blur 1 even in the extreme case of a maximum approach of the tmt lasers in that case the laser will have a width of about w 0 3 m observed at a distance of d 400 m hence w d 0 8 mrad fovpix as a first important outcome we see that both in the low and maximal severity case the impact of either the vlt or elt lgs is negligible in the southern hemisphere installation the predicted photo electron rate is always below 0 3 p e ns for the cameras equipped with pmts this value is of the order of the p e rate produced by the local night sky background light expected to produce roughly 0 3 0 4 p e ns fruck et al 2015 such a small effect limited to few pixels is properly treated in the data reconstruction sipm equipped sst cameras expect a night sky background rate of 0 04 p e ns the 20 see also https www cta observatory org project

severity cases lgs induced may produce an additional background rate of the same order of magnitude however these cameras are not at all limited by such negligible backgrounds a different result is instead found for the northern hemisphere installation of the cta the lasers from both the tmt and the gtc do have a sizeable impact on the camera images of the cta telescopes even in the low severity

emission of the mesospheric sodium layer in the worst case the illuminated sodium layer will be seen by cta under an angular length of h l h 2 25 where h denotes the distance to the layer centroid h 89 7 km and h the average layer width the resulting angular length is always smaller than one camera pixel for the cta n the full layer will hence be seen as just an additional star in the south can become as long as 10 camera pixels however their average flux results to be always less than 0 05 p e ns even in the case of an upgraded lst camera the photo electron rate from the rayleigh plume observed by the outmost camera pixel at the cta n is visible in the closest mst from greater than 4 12 km for the gtc and tmt lasers respectively and the received rate is always smaller than 1 6 p e ns for both cases at 60 observation zenith angle and 0 9 p e ns for observations at zenith using eq 12 in the absolutely worst case the rayleigh plume will leave spurious photo electron rates larger

interference during cta fast repositioning in this section we make use of the formalism of section 3 to estimate the fraction of time in which the lgs will interfere with cta operations in such a way that the underlying science case may be degraded or put at risk given the results from the previous section in which we show that both the vlt and elt lgs will have a negligible impact on cta s we will focus on the cta n only and particularly on the interference of the tmt lgs with the cta telescopes we cannot make accurate predictions of the foreseen observing programs of the cta n for the time after the tmt will start operations 22 because most of the cta observing time will be open for guest observer proposals however the cta consortium can use 40 of the first 10 years of cta operations in the form of proprietary key science projects we use these to make a reasonable guess as to the distribution of target and observation types some of the cta n s core science deals with fast transients and amount to about 45 hr yr site for galactic too s and 120 hr yr site for extra galactic ones for the first 12 years of operation see chapter 9 of the cherenkov telescope array consortium et al 2017 we did not include open time nor director s time which may increase that number further both are however not expected to alter the previous numbers significantly a prediction for the time reserved for rapid multi wavelength campaigns with allocated and immovable time slots can be obtained from chapter 12 of the cherenkov telescope array consortium et al 2017 summing up to 245 h yr for the cta n all dedicated to extra galactic targets further assuming that cta n follows up each alert for an average of two hours which is rather standard for this technique we can expect about 180 fast or immovable re positionings per year hence one fast or immovable re positioning every one and a half nights for extra galactic targets and one fast re positionning every 11 nights for galactic sources fast too observations are typically expected to happen in normal observing mode i e making use of the typical cta n field of view of about eight degrees 23 however we may assume that such observations may be observed up to one degree off axis 24 to avoid the laser beam hence fovvetoed 6 to start we set rcrit to the typical night sky background nsb rate for extra galactic sources this somewhat arbitrary criterion has been chosen assuming that the individual pixel rate control will get active at least in the case of the lsts and raise the trigger thresholds of the illuminated pixels loss of sensitivity at the energy threshold is then expected later on we will investigate in more detail the dependency of the observation time loss on rcrit the maximum altitude hmax comes out to be approximately 14 20 km above ground for the gtc laser and 18 26 km above ground for the six tmt lasers used together if the lst camera is equipped with sipms without further protecting filters the lgs light will disturb observations up to 32 km above ground we assume now a maximum zenith angle for cta n s rapid re positionning targets of maxtel 45 the extra galactic too occurrence phase space covers then a solid angle of about too extra gal 1 8 sr and too gal 0 3 sr we apply the above occurrence estimates of fast too s and time slots reserved for multi wavelength campaigns together with the distances between cta n telescopes and the two lgs facilities at gtc and the tmt table 1 and the values of tel table 4 to equation 22 the resulting probability maps to reside in a certain pointing direction times the probability to veto a cta n too pointing in that direction for extra galactic observations the so called conflict probability maps are shown in figure 10 left side for the lst case only but are almost identical for the case of the mst the reason for this similarity can be found in the geometry of the system because the maximum altitudes hmax are considerably larger than the distance between lgs and cta telescope in both cases and consequently the intersection heights h the contribution of the visible laser path length at the highest altitudes e g from 20 to 26 km to the vetoed angular length is small in other words scales in zero th order as atan hmax l which becomes flatter and flatter as the argument hmax l gets larger the vetoed pointing maps for cta n are hence rather insensitive to the exact values of hmax and consequently rcrit even 22 foreseeably after 2027 23 which is in this case provided by the mst cameras while for cta s a larger fov of ten degrees is obtained with the ssts see table 2 the cta provides also the possibility to observe with even larger fields of view of up to 15 in divergent pointing mode these are however not expected to be employed for rapid pointings at least for the moment 24 the sensitivity of iact telescopes decreases off the optical axis of the telescopes however this happens rather slowly as shown for the magic case aleksic et al 2016 and in cta in recent simulations the latter show that maximally 20 loss of point source sensitivity are obtained for the case of one degree off pointing considerably reduced

probability by about a factor of two if rcrit is chosen to be twenty times larger than the typical background rate the integral of all maps are written below on the same figures and provide the total probability to have an extra galactic cta n too vetoed once the lgs is used at all for comparison we also checked the local pointing field of one year of gtc pointing courtesy of antonio luis cabrera lavers and found compatible results if we use instead a one year vlt lgs pointing history together with the muse instrument about 20 lower conflict probabilities are obtained the integrated probabilities are finally inserted in equation 23 using the lgs duty cycles listed in table 1 these final results are summarized in table 5 5 summary and conclusions in this work we have explored the effect that laser guide star lgs facilities as those foreseen on several present and future large optical telescopes such as the vlt elt the gtc and the tmt have on neighbouring telescopes particularly those observing with large fovs lgs systems operate high power continuous wave lasers at 589 159 nm vacuum wavelength to excite sodium nuclei in the upper mesosphere the laser light can scatter into the fov of the neighbouring instruments and affect data taking or reconstruction we have computed general equations to predict the number of scattered photons into a camera pixel as well as estimates for the fraction of time lost because of possible crossings of the neighbouring telescope fov by the laser beam we have later on applied those equations quantitatively to the case of the cta a planned ground based array of gamma ray instruments currently under construction at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos la palma and soon at the armazones valley close to paranal in

possibly the tmt lgs in the southern hemisphere the cta s will contain three types of telescopes adding the sst type and is located close to the vlt and elt lgs in subsection 4 1 the amount of scattered laser light into cta camera pixels has been computed and two case scenarios a low and a maximal severity case studied the obtained numbers provide a rough estimate for the ranges within which lgs induced photo electron rates can be expected namely for the gtc laser from 2 5 p e ns for pmt based lst or mst cameras to about 10 30 p e ns for an lst camera equipped with sipm for the tmt lgs with six simultaneous beams from 3 14 p e ns for pmt based lst or mst cameras to about 30 80 p e ns for an lst camera equipped with sipm for the more distant vlt with four lasers or elt lasers with six beams rates lie always well below 1 6 p e ns even in the case of an lst camera equipped with sipm otherwise below 0 3 p e ns the ssts which are only deployed in the south are not affected at all by the vlt or the elt lasers rates below 0 01 p e ns although they approach the vlt and elt most the critical combination is hence the one of the tmt in less extent the gtc lasers shining into the cta n telescopes especially if lst cameras are potentially upgraded to sipm in the future the obtained count rates can be compared to those of the night sky background expected to produce roughly 0 3 0 4 p e per mst lst pixel per nanosecond respectively fruck et al 2015 however observations are also planned under partial moon light with night sky background rates up to about 20 times higher than the previous numbers under reduced sensitivity see e g ahnen et al 2017 the effect of all investigated cases is similar to having a row of magnitude down to as low as 1 m b stars crossing the camera even if the six tmt lasers are fired in divergent mode only one row will be seen in the telescope cameras i e the different laser beams cannot be resolved the fluorescing sodium layer itself measures 11 km on average and can even reach 16 km in exceptional cases moussaoui et al 2010 it is however harmless if found in the fov of the neighbouring telescope if both installations are sufficiently close as is the case at cta n at larger distances the layer can spread over several pixels as at cta s but the light flux received by a single camera pixel is then considerably lower than the artifical star produced in the telescope housing the lgs and probably negligible this is the case at cta s some residual spurious light of the order of 1 p e ns will be received however at the cta n by the outmost camera pixels of the closest msts from the rayleigh plume of the lgs lasers of the gtc and the tmt if both installations observe the same source in this situation the laser photons are not a danger for the safety of the cta n cameras each cta n camera pixel is equipped with an automatic high voltage down regulation in case of excessive anode current which makes observations safe this mechanism will probably also protect the cta n against too high data rates of fake triggers however analysis of data affected by such an lgs laser beam crossing the camera is challenging and should be avoided apart from the inevitable loss of sensitivity experience with the magic telescopes has shown that additionally the laser beam can confuse the star guider analysis software used to correct the pointing of the telescopes with the help of ccd cameras whereas solutions based on notch filters schallenberg et al 2010 exist for the ccd cameras similar approaches for the cta camera pixels require future study and some innovation effort coating of curved surfaces with filters is not straight forward nor thin filters resisting all types of weather phenomena like temperature changes humidity cycles etc to which for instance a protecting plexiglas of the cameras is exposed during night also losses of cherenkov photons in the wavelength range from 300 nm to 550 nm are an issue in subsection 4 2 we derived the probabilities that a cta n observation collides with the lgs laser beam causing an mnras in press 1 24 2018 impact of lgs system on cta 19 unacceptably high photo electron rate in the cta n camera when different sources are observed 25 we find around 1 3 for extra galactic observations of cta n to collide with the gtc tmt lgs beams and around 1 5 for galactic observations respectively the lower probabilities for the gtc laser are due to both its smaller relative duty cycle and its lower laser power which in consequence allows to cross the cta n field of view at a lower limiting altitude even if cta n telescopes approach that laser much closer these probabilities can be reduced by only 5 if lgs laser induced additional p e rates of up to five times the natural dark night sky background rate are allowed relieving this requirement to 20 times the night sky background rate corresponding to observations under partial moon light reduces the conflict probabilities by about a factor of two unless a sipm upgraded lst camera is used for which the reduction is of the order of 10 only since both the cta n observatory and the gtc tmt lgs facilities will be included in the laser tracking control system ltcs of the orm most conflicts can be avoided by adequate scheduling of the sources due to the nature of the current basic configuration of ltcs at the orm which currently follows a strict first on target policy this is however not the case for fast target of opportunity too alerts of cta n which cannot be scheduled to later times without putting at risk the science case such fast too s and those requiring simultaneous multi wavelength or multi messenger coverage will occur 180 22 times per year for extra galactic galactic targets following the key science programs of the cta n the cherenkov telescope array consortium et al 2017 a collision in such a case will then happen 1 6 times a year for extra galactic too s with the gtc tmt lgs beam respectively and 0 2 1 times a year for galactic too s excluding those cases where both installations observe the same target because the glowing sodium layer will be imaged either into one camera pixel in the case of cta n and hence treated as just an additional star or become too faint and indistinguable from the night sky background in the case of cta s in order to minimize the impact of science loss both for the cta and for the gtc tmt we suggest a modification of the strict first on target policy of the current configuration of the ltcs such enhanced versions of the ltcs santos et al 2016 are already operative at mauna kea and paranal but require a previous consensus on newly defined priorities for observation targetting assuming that the relation of time reserved for fast too s and multi wavelength multi messenger observations with respect to the total available time is similar to the one foreseen for the cta n we expect then a reduction of the number of conflicts leading to science loss at one or the other side by at least a factor of three this would include new rules such that the observation of a science target with less urgency by one part yields priority to the other unless the levels of urgency are comparable such low conflict rates can then be considered negligible if compared to other external disturbances like technical problems or the weather acknowledgments the authors thank the anonymous referees for their fruitful and professional comments which helped to improve the paper this work has been funded by the grant
