2016 in original form abstract the evolution with cosmic time of the star formation rate density sfrd and of the main sequence star formation rate stellar mass relations are two well established observational facts in this paper the implications of these two relations combined are analytically explored showing that quenching of star formation must start already at very early cosmic times and the quenched fraction then dominates ever since over the star forming one thus a simple picture of the cosmic evolution of the global sfrd is derived in terms of the interplay between star formation and its quenching key words galaxies evolution galaxies formation galaxies high redshift 1 introduction a high level description of star formation in galaxies through cosmic times is best given by two widely used relations namely the main sequence ms of star forming galaxies i e the tight relation between star formation rate sfr and stellar mass m daddi et al 2007 noeske et al 2007 elbaz et al 2007 and the so called lilly madau plot giving the time redshift evolution of the sfr density sfrd of the universe lilly et al 1996 madau et al 1996 yet how the two relations interact with each other has not been duly explored so far an issue that this paper is meant to address in the simplest possible fashion over the twenty years since its discovery much progress has been achieved in observationally establishing the evolu tion of the sfrd a progress that is illustrated in the recent review by madau dickinson 2014 from which we adopt sfrd z 0 015 1 z 2 7 1 1 z 2 9 5 6 m yr 1 mpc 3 1 holding all the way from z 0 to z 8 at the same time much effort has been devoted to ex plore the evolution of the ms relation in slope shape and normalization e g pannella et al 2009 peng et al 2010 rodighiero

salmon et al 2015 with the ms relation being in place at least up to z 6 speagle et al 2014 however the ms slope and shape may differ appreciably from one of such studies to another e mail alvio renzini oapd inaf it depending on how star forming galaxies sfg are selected and how sfrs and stellar masses are measured see e g the compilation by speagle et al 2014 following peng et al 2010 we adopt for the specific sfr ssfr sfr m ssfr t 2 5 10 9 t 3 5 gyr 2 2 gyr 1 2 where the parameter has been introduced to compensate if necessary for a possible mismatch resulting from different systematics in mass and sfr measurements affecting the two relations above equation 2 holds for cosmic time t 3 5 gyr i e z 2 whereas the run of ssfr for earlier times is more uncertain for example gonzalez et al 2010 found a flat ssfr for z 2 while according to stark et al 2013 the ssfr keeps increasing by another factor of 5 up to at least z 7 see figure 13 in madau dickinson 2014 in the following for t 6 3 5 gyr we adopt an analytical extension of equation 2 continuous with its derivative that gradually flattens doubling to 5 10 9 gyr 1 by t 0 627 gyr i e the age of the universe at z 8 in the adopted cosmology 0 3 0 7 and h 70 in any way we shall briefly comment on what would have resulted if adopting either the gonzalez et al 2010 or the stark et al 2013 recipes in the sequel referring to equation 2 i will mean to include this early epoch extension adopting a ssfr t independent of mass i e sfr m as in equation 2 needs to be justified it is indeed well known that in most determinations the ms slope tends to be lower than unity typically 0 8 and may flatten for high m values see references above however abramson et al 2014 find the slope to be about unity if considering only the stellar mass of the star forming portion of galaxies hav ing decomposed local galaxies in their active star forming disk and quenched bulge similarly salmi et al 2012 find a ms with slope 1 at z 1 when restricting to disk c 0000 ras ar x iv 1 60 4 01 34 2 v 1 as tr o ph g a 5 a pr 2 01 6 2 alvio renzini figure 1 the run of the star formation rate density sfrd black line as a function of cosmic time as from madau dick inson 2014 the red line represents the growth of the sfrd that would result from the adopted ssfr from equation 7 in absence of quenching dominated galaxies i e those with se rsic index n 1 5 at higher redshifts z 2 2 the apparent bending of the ms disappears when removing from the mass budget the mass of almost quenched bulges tacchella et al 2015 thus there is observational evidence supporting the notion of a linear relation between sfr and the stellar mass of the actively star forming portions of galaxies such as their disks therefore here we assume that equation 2 represents such relation simplicity is an additional reason to adopt a linear ms relation between sfr and m the procedures to be pre sented in this paper could be generalized to accommodate a ms relation of any kind in slope and shape but this would come at the expenses of simplicity requiring a much more laborious procedure including the mass function of galaxies and its evolution in the present approach we refrain from embarking in such complexities opting instead for simplic ity with the aim of capturing just the essentials of the global evolution 2 stellar mass growth and quenching a first adjustment between equation 1 and equation 2 is required as madau dickinson 2014 used a salpeter imf while peng et al 2010 used a chabrier imf thus in the sequel we use a sfrd t reduced by a factor 1 7 compared to equation 1 with the resulting sfrd t the growth of the stellar mass density of the universe is then given by t 1 r t t sfrd t dt 3 where r is the return fraction due to stellar mass loss we assume r 0 3 and t 0 627 gyr is the cosmic time corresponding to z 8 given the stellar density and the ssfr the sfrd of the universe follows naturally as sfrd t ssfr t sf t 4 where sf t is the stellar density of those galaxies or part of that are actively star forming and on average follow the ms relation as given by equation 2 therefore the stellar mass in galaxies or part of whose ssfr is than given by equation 2 is not included in sf such non star forming stellar mass is hosted by quenched galaxies or galaxies well underway to be quenched and by the quenched spheroid bulge and halo of galaxies still hosting a star forming disk thus sf t sfrd t ssfr t 5 can be regarded as the definition of the actively star forming stellar mass density of the universe by the same token q t t sf t 6 is the stellar mass density of the universe in quenched galax ies or quenched fraction of star forming ones e g quenched bulges and halos in other words a stellar mass density sf is sufficient to produce the observed sfrd if forming stars at the main sequence ssfr as given by equation 2 cor respondingly a stellar mass q must be quenched i e with a much lower ssfr for the sake of clarity in this paper by quenching one means the drop of the ssfr of galaxies from its ms value given by equation 2 to much lower values and quenched galaxies or portion of are those which ssfr is than given by equation 2 without any implication on the physical processes that may have led to such low ssfr if all the stellar mass produced by star formation were to remain actively star forming and lying on the ms with a ssfr from equation 2 i e in absence of any quenching then the stellar mass would grow as d t dt 1 r ssfr t t 7 which upon integration implies a quasi exponential growth of both stellar mass and sfr densities at early times e g if the ssfr is nearly constant this is perfectly analog to the result of the same kind of integration once performed for individual galaxies also giving rise to an early quasi exponential growth of their stellar mass and sfr renzini 2009 peng et al 2010 leitner 2012 lee et al 2014 spea gle et al 2014 the result of such integration for 1 is shown in figure 1 as a red line labeled without quenching whereas the black line shows the actual sfrd from equa tion 1 reduced by the 1 7 factor for a short time interval the red line overlaps the black one meaning that indeed at the beginning virtually all stellar mass remains star form ing but soon it departs and keeps diverging very steeply from the actual sfrd implying that without quenching stellar mass and sfr densities would be dramatically over produced this is now on a global scale the same catas trophic growth that would happen to individual galaxies in absence of quenching renzini 2009 once more it is the high ssfr that demands quenching actually the higher the adopted ssfr the lower the sf which is sufficient to produce the observed sfrd and therefore the higher the c 0000 ras mnras 000 000 000 the dominance of quenching 3 figure 2 the growth of the total stellar mass density as a func tion of cosmic time black line together with that of the quenched and star forming fractions red and blue lines respectively resulting quenched mass q from equation 6 so para doxically more quenching is required the higher the ssfr figure 2 shows the corresponding evolution of the total stellar density t as well as those of the star forming and quenched fractions as from equations 3 5 and 6 re spectively two notable results illustrated by this figure are worth emphasizing the first is that quenching sets in very early and by t 2 gyr i e z 3 the quenched fraction takes over the star forming one and increasingly dominates all the way to z 0 the second remarkable result is that the cosmic stellar density of the star forming fraction remains essentially constant since t 6 gyr z 1 and there fore the corresponding drop of the sfrd is almost entirely due to the drop of the main sequence ssfr t 2 2 during the same time interval yet sf t remains nearly constant because the new stellar mass produced by the sfrd is al most precisely compensated by the quenching rate density i e the stellar mass that quench per year and per mpc 3 thus both quenching and the secular decline of the ssfr of ms galaxies concur in determining the cosmic decline of the sfrd since z 2 from figure 2 we also see that at the present time i e t 13 7 gyr the star forming and quenched fractions ac count for respectively 22 and 78 of the total stellar mass density of the universe this compares quite favorably with what is observed locally from the bulge disk decom position operated by abramson et al 2014 at z 0 it is indeed estimated that only 23 of the stellar mass is in star forming environments today i e in star forming disks the remaining fraction being in quenched galaxies and in quenched bulges l e abramson private communication this is also in fair agreement with the moustakas et al 2013 finding that sfgs account locally for 40 of the stellar mass which reduces to 25 28 when excluding their quenched bulges from the mass budget which accounts for 30 40 of their stellar mass e g lang et al 2014 3 caveats and discussion the results illustrated in figures 1 and 2 derive uniquely from the cosmic star formation history and the evolution of the main sequence of sfgs as given by equations 1 and 2 respectively as such the numerical results may change if in the future more accurate relations could be derived from observations in any event these results are more solid for t 3 5 z 2 than at earlier times basically because the ssfr is more uncertain at higher redshifts say z 3 t 2 gyr when nevertheless only a quite minor fraction of the final stellar mass is built up assuming a ssfr t that keeps increasing as t 2 2 all the way to t t 0 627 gyr would produce a from equation 7 growing extremely fast at early time and a sfrd ssfr running almost vertically already since t t to avoid such overgrowth an enormous quenching rate would be required to keep the sfrd at the actual ob served level given by equation 1 in n practice the quench ing rate should almost equal the sfrd itself which looks quite implausible even the less extreme ssfr t from stark et al 2013 with its factor of 5 increase beyond z 2 would encounter the same problem as would the ssfr from salmon et al 2015 with it factor of 10 increase between z 2 and z 7 or the factor 8 increase found by faisst et al 2016 if instead one adopts a ssfr that remains constant be yond z 2 then the sf t required to match the observed sfrd t at z 8 would be a factor 3 higher than t as reported by madau dickinson 2014 we conclude that our heuristic assumption of a smooth and flattening increase of the ssfr for t 3 5 gyr does not incur in these oppo site difficulties actually minimizes the required quenching at early times and is more keen the factor of 2 increase from z 2 to z 6 found by gonzalez et al 2014 see also tasca et al 2015 in any way the actual run of the quenched and star forming fractions at very early times since t remains uncertain modulo the adopted ssfr however at later times the relative contributions of the quenched and star forming fractions are independent of what is assumed for the ssfr at early times hence the re sults are definitely more robust the main uncertainty re mains the possibility of a relative systematics between equa tion 1 and equation 2 as sfrs and stellar masses were derived independently by different teams this can be quan titatively explored by varying the parameter introduced in equation 2 for example if peng et al 2010 had sys tematically overestimated the ssfr by say 20 relative to madau dickinson 2014 then one should take 0 8 to restore consistency therefore from equation 5 the re sulting sf t would be 20 higher than shown in figure 2 with q t being correspondingly reduced as demanded by equation 6 thus the parameter controls the relative proportion of sf t and q t but it is indeed quite reas suring that a reasonable result at z 0 is obtained just for 1 a plot such as that in figure 2 is potentially subject to observational check at all redshifts mapping the growth of both sf t and q t as they have been defined above while this goes beyond the scope of this paper a few con siderations are in order muzzin et al 2013 and tomczak et al 2014 have used the rest frame uv j selection wuyts c 0000 ras mnras 000 000 000 4 alvio renzini et al 2007 to map the stellar mass density in star forming and quenched galaxies all the way to z 4 finding that only at z 1 the mass density in quenched galaxies takes over that of star forming ones at apparently macroscopic variance with what shown in figure 2 where this happens at a much earlier time i e at z 3 however the uv j selection was used to pick only fully quenched galaxies and therefore did not account for the bulge spheroid quenched portion of sfgs so a comparison with the muzzin et al 2013 and tomczak et al 2014 results is far from being conclusive moreover a bimodal distribution of galaxies in the uv j plot is recognizable only up to z 2 and be yond this redshift the distinction between star forming and quenched galaxies gets more difficult in addition at all red shifts it is easier to identify sfgs rather than quenched ones and mass functions can be traced only down to an higher and higher mass completeness limit for these reasons it appears quite premature to overplot existing data on dia grams such as figure 2 this should rather be taken as a predictions for future observations to check critical will be a bulge disk decomposition at all red shifts able to estimate the ssfr in a space resolved fashion hence able to distinguish quenched bulges and their star forming disks few such attempts have been made so far for example using h emission this has been possible only for a handful of galaxies at z 2 2 and only after much ob servational efforts genzel et al 2014 tacchella et al 2015 or at z 1 from two dimensional hst grism spectra nel son et al 2015 a mere morphological bulge disk decompo sition is indeed insufficient to distinguish the quenched and star forming parts of high redshift galaxies e g lang et al 2014 as star forming bulges and quenched disks also exist for example the majority of quenched galaxies at z 2 are disk dominated with also the disk being quenched van der wel et al 2011 according to lang et al 2014 at z 2 about 30 of stellar mass is in fully quenched galax ies and 70 is in star forming galaxies in these latter galaxies bulges account for 40 of the stellar mass and if one can assume that such bulges are quenched then the star forming disk fraction would be 40 and the corre sponding quenched fraction 60 this is not too far from the q sf ratio 2 at z 2 t 3 5 gyr as shown in figure 2 in lang et al 2014 the bulge disk decomposi tion assumes that bulges and disks have se rsic index n 4 and 1 respectively however there cannot be a one to one correspondence between morphology in one specific photo metric band and star formation activity ssfr quenched bulges can indeed have n 4 while other n 4 bulges may still be actively star forming wuyts et al 2011 so the above comparison between the predicted quenched frac tion and that inferred from existing observations can only be regarded as very preliminary what is needed is e g a space resolved rest frame uv j mapping of galaxies able to distinguish their star forming and quenched parts but this technology is not yet fully in place beyond the h or k band existing data lack sen sitivity and or spatial resolution however a spatially re solved mapping of high redshift galaxies with the rest frame uv j technique should soon become possible with the james webb space telescope jwst from the ground adaptive optics assisted h mapping of a large sample of star forming galaxies would be very valuable in this respect being poten tially able to separate non h emitting bulges from actively star forming disks ultimately if a tension would persist be tween predicted and observed quenched fractions this would indicate that the sfrd ssfr ratio was observationally un derestimated e g at high redshifts the ssfr of ms galaxies as from equation 2 was overestimated and or the sfr m relation of star forming disks may deviate from linearity for example if one were to insist for the crossover of the quenched and star forming fractions to take place at z 1 rather than at z 3 then from figure 2 one sees that this can be achieved for 0 60 but given the good match to the data at z 0 with 1 it would be the time evolution of the main sequence that would have to be changed in such a way to have its ssfr reduced by 40 by z 1 over the rate given by equation 2 one prediction of these simple calculations is that there should be a great deal of quenched stellar mass beyond z 2 actually exceeding the star forming mass at first sight this may appear to be at variance with the peng et al 2010 mass quenching and environment quenching paradigm as at very high redshift galaxies may have not reached yet the schechter cutoff mass m above which mass quenching efficiently operates while environmental overden sities have not yet grown enough to trigger environmental satellite quenching however in the local universe there are various examples of early quenching globular clusters are the oldest objects with a well measured age they were formed and quenched beyond z 3 and their progenitors may have been ten or more times more massive than the surviving clusters e g renzini et al 2015 and references therein local ultra faint dwarf galaxies appear to be as old as globular clusters and like them were soon quenched as well brown et al 2014 while most may have been tidally de stroyed so infant mortality appears to have operated quite effectively already at very early times and on mass scales of 107 108 m objects or less which may account for up to a few percent of the stellar mass at z 0 not too far from the mass of the quenched fraction for t 2 gyr seen in figure 2 4 conclusions in this paper only two observationally derived relations have been used namely the evolution of the sfrd since z 8 as compiled and fit by madau dickinson 2014 and the evolution of the ssfr for near main sequence galaxies as analytically rendered by peng et al 2010 taking these two relations for granted their combination has several rel evant consequences for the evolution and build up of stellar mass and star formation quenching on a global scale the main implications of this simple reading of the cosmic star formation history are the following quenching of star formation within galaxies must start at very early times and by cosmic time t 2 gyr on z 3 the stellar mass in the quenched fraction can domi nate over the star forming fraction by star forming fraction one means those galaxies or part of them whose ssfr fol lows the ms relation as given by equation 2 i e ssfr ssfrms by quenched fraction one means all galaxies for which ssfr ssfrms including the parts of star forming c 0000 ras mnras 000 000 000 the dominance of quenching 5 galaxies with ssfr ssfrms such as quenched bulges and stellar halos with the adopted runs of the sfrd and the ssfr by z 0 only 22 of the stellar mass is contained in star forming environments i e in star forming disks with 78 being instead in quenched galaxies or in the quenched bulges and stellar halos of galaxies still supporting star for mation in their disk this appears to be in fair agreement with the corresponding observed fractions the run of the ssfr of star forming galaxies is observa tionally more uncertain for z 2 it is argued that a modest increase beyond z 2 say by a factor of 2 minimizes the need for quenching at very high redshift while offering a bet ter match to the observed stellar mass density as reported by madau dickinson 2014 instead a steeper increase of the ssfr such as in stark et al 2013 or salmon et al 2015 would require an extremely high quenching rate already at z 8 almost equal to the sfrd over the last 8 gyr the stellar mass in star forming environments star forming disks has remained nearly con stant meaning that the observed drop in the cosmic sfrd over the same time interval is due almost entirely to the sec ular decrease of the ssfr of main sequence galaxies this means that during such time interval the sfrd was almost precisely compensated by the quenching rate density i e as much new stellar mass is produced as it gets quenched quite a remarkable coincidence indeed hence both quench ing and the decline of ssfrms concur in establishing the observed decline of the sfrd from z 2 to 0 there may be a moderate tension between the predicted and observed quenched fractions at z 2 but existing ob servational data are still insufficient to fully test much be yond the local universe the consequences of equations 1 and 2 combined as explored in this paper this would require a full recovery of quenched galaxies and quenched spheroids all the way to high redshifts decomposing star forming disks from quenched spheroids which will become possible with jwst of course it remains to be understood what are the physical mechanisms of quenching from the early to the late cosmic times
