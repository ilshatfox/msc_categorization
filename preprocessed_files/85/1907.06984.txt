original form zzz abstract we propose a different way to obtain the distribution of the luminosity function of quasars by using the principle of maximum entropy the input data comes from the sdss dr 3 quasars counts extending up to redshift 5 and limited from apparent magnitude i 15 to 19 1 at z 3 to i 20 2 for z 3 using only few initial data points the principle allows us to estimate probabilities and hence that luminosity curve we carry out statistical tests to evaluate our results the resulting luminosity function compares well to earlier determinations and our results remain consistent either when the amount or choice of sampled sources is unbiasedly altered besides this we estimate the distribution of the luminosity function for redshifts in which there is only observational data in the vicinity key words methods data analysis quasars general galaxies luminosity function 1 introduction the quasar luminosity function gives a measure for the bidi mensional distribution of quasars in luminosity and redshift fundamentally it indicates that the universe is not in a sta tionary state as consequence it requires the due interpreta tion before using quasars to determine cosmological param eters but at the same time it informs about the evolution of quasars themselves and the changing content of the space intervening between distant quasars and the observer the function usually describing the quasar luminosity function as a function of redshift and absolute luminosity basically starts from the modulus distance formulae and incorporates several corrections to accommodate line emission the ex panding universe scale of distance the intrinsic dependency of quasar light emission on wavelength terms of self and media absorption etc the result is an empirical descrip tion which exponents and coefficients are adjusted to each sample examined it is interesting thus to build an indepen dent function able to describe the quasar luminosity func e mail oat 1 on

incorporating the astrophysical and cosmological assumptions an alternative simpler form for the quasar luminosity function can be derived from the statistical mechanics methods the concept of entropy since clausius became part of thermodynamics in addition it also became part of statisti cal mechanics the study of systems in equilibrium and out of equilibrium is closely related to the notions of entropy as well as its production there is a vast bibliography about it with warm discussions we can cite three important re lated principles ziegler s maximum entropy production prin ciple e g ziegler 1983 ziegler 1987 see also dewar 2005 prigogine s minimum entropy production principle prigogine 1967 prigogine 1978 kondepudi et al 1999 1 and the maximum entropy principle maxent jaynes 1957 this paper employs the last one derivations of the first two principles from maxent can be found in literature as seen in martyushev et al 2006 in that review the authors make a very interesting description of the maxent focusing on the production of entropy other authors emphasize that jaynes s maxent formulation of sta 1 this principle is the subject of a specific work in jaynes 1980 c 2018 the authors ar x iv 1 90 7 06 98 4 v 1 as tr o ph g a 1 6 ju l 20 19 2 a andrei et al tistical mechanics provides a theoretical basis for maximum entropy production principle dewar maritan 2014 the applications of the maxent are many we ll see below re lated issues and discuss how they are connected to the focus of our treatment that aims to find the distribution of the luminosity function of quasars despite this vast reach there are authors who restrict the maxent applications see eg shimony 1985 and ref erences therein some of these critiques were addressed by jaynes him self jaynes 1989 in this paper jaynes also provides a fairly complete description of maxent from its roots to its implications on the other hand we can not fail to men tion that there are also papers written exactly in defense of jaynes s principle as in tikochinsky et al 1984 stat ing with the only consistent algorithm is one that leads to the distribution of maximum entropy subject to constraints given there are other papers with very interesting cri tiques that bring out points for and against maxent and provide quite compelling references on the subject like in the appendix a of pontzen et al 2013 where the authors sketch jaynes s reasoning that the maximization of entropy subject to certain constraints is equivalent to testing whether these constraints encapsulate later the physics of the situa tion and the use of the method to derive the phase space distribution of a virialized dark matter halo in addition there are several other areas in physics and astrophysics where it can be applied some examples are in spectral analysis ables 1974 where the method produces superior spectral representations when compared with more traditional methods as well as a powerful technique of im age reconstruction skilling bryan 1984 in the same pa per other applications of maxent in astronomy can be found in gull et al 1978 maxent is applied in radio and x ray astronomy it is interesting that the method is also applied in x ray tomographic image reconstruction and restoration mohammad djafari 1989 in the case of astrophysics and cosmology we see papers where the dark energy equation of state w z is reconstructed using the maxent zunckel et al 2007 in gravitation with the confirmation in 2016 of the ex istence of the gravitational waves predicted by a einstein the study of the black holes assumes still greater impor tance the earliest detections were precisely on collisions of black holes abbott et al 2016 the traditional second law of thermodynamics was modified into a generalized sec ond law for the study of black holes bekenstein 1974 the jaynes s method of maximum entropy was also used by bekenstein to determine the probability distribution for a system containing a kerr black hole bekenstein 1975 this paper presents a new approach to find the dis tribution of probabilities of the luminosity function using the maxent technique even with some criticisms like those cited above we believe that the maxent is extremely use ful to be applied when we have partial information about a certain system so this principle allows us to know accurate probabilities see formula 4 from a small data set al though the number of known quasars is constantly increas ing to get perhaps to a million known objects in the next decade small subsamples are useful and had not been yet designed by lack of elements on one hand the quasars zoo is also growing different types of active galaxies conceivably exhibiting luminosity functions peculiar by a certain degree on the other hand the capability of mapping in detail par ticular thin slices of the universe in redshift is long sought nonetheless to better define the complex form of the lumi nosity function finally it is important to be able to drawn different samples of a large dataset for sanity check control is this paper we will explore such capability of the maxent description of the luminosity distribution since quasars discovery schmidt 1963 matthews sandage 1963 their energy output and magnitude have been object of much observation and increasingly complex theories conversely that information became much used for studies as surrounding host galaxies gravitational lenses in situ and intergalactic absorption up to the cosmolog ical scale of distances in an expanding universe the so called luminosity function is all important to make sense of such extraordinary energy output and to those astrophysical quantities from it derived the evolution of the quasar lumi nosity function with redshift is an important observational tool that allows us to put constraints on the formation and growth history of supermassive black holes and their co evolution with host galaxies it also give us a measure of the contribution of quasars in the cosmological reionization of the universe for all these the study of the quasar lumi nosity function has received the attention of several works eg richards et al 2006 masters et al 2012 ross et al 2013 manti et al 2017 so among some successful applications of maxent in astrophysics we are going now to explore a new one in the study of the quasar luminosity function the sloan digital sky survey sdss 2 provided obser vations of quasars in different redshifts being responsible for the identification of the vast majority of the known quasi stellar objects qsos pa ris et al 2018 however there are observational limitations to the effect that one can ask what would be the quasar distribution on each redshift slice if we could consider unobserved magnitudes these observa tional limitations must be taken into account when comput ing the quasar luminosity function however this does not constitute the aim of this work so we are going to use al ready corrected counts of qsos computed by richards et al 2006 in their study of the quasar luminosity function we show here that the maxent can provide a good distribution of probabilities for the luminosity function from few values of a limited sample in each redshift the luminosity function provides the density distribu tion of classes of objects per unit volume and assuming a statistically complete sample in the case of quasars this in dicates more or less probable scenarios for their formation and evolution as well as their relationship with the host galaxy quasars have been found out by several projects chiefly the sdss relying on different strategies to single them out from the more numerous contaminants of other ce lestial bodies the esa cornerstone mission gaia combines the recognition of such known quasars with micro arcsecond determination of proper motions over five years therefore providing direct means to cleanse away the intruding false positives as nearby red dwarfs on top of it gaia will use a neural network strategy leading to autonomous recognition 2 http www sdss org mnras 000 1 2018 http www sdss org luminosity function in qsos by maxent 3 of quasars combined to the all sky repeated sweeping of objects up to near red twentieth second magnitude it will produce an unprecedent complete sample of quasars there fore to establish an alternative independent and physics robust method of tracing the quasar luminosity function af fords a strong way of checking upon and getting feedback from the usual schechter based determination in short the motivations for these studies are threefold an independent study of the luminosity function on the quasar population in the sdss dr 3 the development of an independent tool for determining the luminosity function based on maximum entropy physics and it is a comparative assessment on a limited sample with views to application on the all sky sta tistically complete sample of quasars in final gaia catalogue elseways the definition of the quasars luminosity func tion have so far been done using a modified template of the schechter exponential for galaxies such a description although well adapted to the somehow simpler quasar case since it is in practice free from the surface brightness issue limits the reliability of the astrophysical and cosmological in terpretation of the luminosity function to mention a few it is known that the shape and turnover of the luminosity func tion would favor either models for the growth of the super massive black hole from mergers or by inflow and host galaxy instabilities the bright end of the luminosity function can favor intrinsic properties about which time black holes are increasing in mass rapidly whereas the faintest end would in dicate about the length of time quasars spend at relatively low accretion rates the remainder of this work is organized as follows in section 2 we will briefly review the maxent method with this we establish our main formula the equation 4 which defines from maxent the probability of the luminosity func tion in section 3 we will summarize our technique to deter mine the luminosity function of quasars and we show the details of how the lagrange multipliers were calculated for the studied cases in addition we will show the comparison between our result by maxent and the schechter s based richards et al 2006 one in section 4 we will describe the statistical tests we use in section 5 from few observational data in particular red shifts we will make a prediction of the pdf probability density function for in between redshifts that is we will estimate the distribution of the luminosity function finally a summary discussion and conclusions are presented in the last section 2 the jaynes approach to maximum entropy principle we can sum up the maximum entropy principle as we shall see in the sequel 3 as there is a vast bibliography regarding this principle we will only make a brief account initially we assume that a quantity x can have the dis crete values xi i 1 2 n but we do not know the cor responding probabilities pi all we have is the expectation 3 here we will follow jaynes 1957 value of the function f x f x n i 1 pif xi 1 based on this information how can we obtain the expecta tion value of another function of the system g x jaynes responds to this apparently insoluble question the given information is insufficient to determine the probabilities pi the equation 1 and the normalization condition pi 1 2 would have to be supplemented by n 2 more conditions before g x could be found in order to find a solution to this problem jaynes s method uses the following expression for entropy h p 1 p 2 pn k i pi ln pi 3 where k is a positive constant since h is just the expression for entropy as found in statistical mechanics it will be called the entropy of the probability distribution pi the entropy h given in 3 is maximized subject to the constraints 1 and 2 in order to achieve a final expression for the probability of xi we use the method of lagrangian multipliers usually noted by and where is associated with the normalization equation i e the equation 2 and is associated with the equation of the expectation value 1 with this methodol ogy we obtain the probability pi e f xi 4 this formula gives an important expression which can be associated to the function of the luminosity distribution of the objects to which we wish to estimate the distribution and the method used in its determination is called the maxi mum entropy principle see the complete development from data to lagrange multipliers at appendix b 3 the luminosity function of qso s from maxent to summarize what will be done next from maxent we will determine the distribution of the luminosity function of the quasars in a certain redshift zk by using the probabil ity distribution 4 notice that the strong energy released by quasars make possible to observe them from the nearby universe at least up to redshifts greater than 7 eg ban a dos et al 2018 this large range of distance hence an evolving luminosity function allowed us to inspect how con sistent are the predictions from maxent and compare the results against those originally derived from the same ob served data used here as control result in the maxent methodology for the consistency of the principle the strongest symmetry that we could have a pri ori would be the uniform distribution but this is not the case we know that if we have a single constraint that is associated with normalization n i 1 pi 1 we get exactly for n n pi 1 n or the uniform distribution the other constraint associated with equation 1 breaks this symmetry let us also remember that as it is well placed in caticha preuss 2004 the method of maximum entropy mnras 000 1 2018 4 a andrei et al me is designed for updating from a prior probability dis tribution to a posterior distribution when the information to be processed takes the form of a constraint then we as sume that we can extract a certain expected value obtained through some luminosity values provided by the system ob servations which obviously have the uniformity between all values broken these values are randomly chosen and under these conditions we will apply maxent with their two con straints 1 and 2 this is the central point of the method ology namely that from just some values a strong estimate of the luminosity function of the distribution of all values in this redshift can be made 4 for the present quasar luminosity function derivation by maxent we have tested different sets from the whole of the initial data seeing in every case great accordance between the luminosity curve from maxent and the control result in order to analyze the most realistic scenario the one for which the sample is small and thus not necessarily containing a perfect representation of the data population we choose to analyze here the results from random initial data we have picked up just three luminosities in each redshift as initial data the starting point of using maxent is the calculation of and from the equations 1 and 2 see details in ap pendix b from a certain redshift the mean value to be used in the lagrange multiplier method is calculated from three luminosities randomly chosen to each of which is as signed the corrected number of quasars in that luminosity bin after applying the selection function of richards et al 2006 table 6 p 2782 those values will be used to calcu late the weighted mean luminosity lz which is the value to be used in the equation 1 the other lagrange multi plier comes from the normalization of the probability or n i 1 pi 1 errors have been calculated using a bootstrap method in each case three random luminosities were drawn 200 times and the mean value used to find a different and that applied to original data gave us a different set of points the extreme values stand as the upper and lower limits of the error bars to the results from the principle likewise the er rors on the control result were calculated using probabilities from bootstrap draws verifying our assumptions the calculated probabilities by maxent and the ones of the control results show similar behavior for each redshift the complete table leading to the con trol result is in appendix a table a 1 and the three ones randomly chosen in each redshift are on the lines indicated in bold at the first column the conversion from calibrated magnitudes to luminosi ties was done using the following relation l 10 mi 48 6 2 5 4 3 0857 1019 2 5 where l in ergs s 1 hz 1 is the luminosity and mi the magnitude 4 one interesting question posed by jaynes is generating para doxes in the case of continuously variable random quantities since intuitive notions of equally possible are altered by a change of variables jaynes 1957 p 622 the curves obtained for each redshift are shown in fig ure 1 we can see clearly that a correspondence is found at the sampled redshifts within the error bars between the maxent results and those for the control 4 statistical tests as discussed in the previous paragraphs and detailed in appendix b the maxent approach from robust yet simple physical principles and computational algorithms delivers a statistical probability distribution of the luminosity function which is cosmologically plausible vis a vis the literature on the subject the magnitude and redshift data used for that is taken from the sdss project it is natural thus that the outcomes from the luminosity function here obtained shall be compared with those from the sdss analysis at the start of the current application of the max ent principle to derive the quasars luminosity function sev eral approaches were used choosing by hand representa tive data choosing data from quartiles of the distribution and picking up the extreme and mean values the outcomes were always concurrent they are available under request what served as sanity check as well as gave us ground to adopt the random draws finally used the plots in figure 1 are compelling to show the agreement between the two lu minosity function statistical probability distributions such agreement can be quantified table 1 shows results of the statistical tests comparing the two distributions of proba bilities the one from maxent and the one from the control results at each redshift as indicated in section 3 a minimal number of points were randomly drawn from the data using only these few data points maxent can provide us an estimate luminosity function to be compared with the luminosity function ob tained from the control results the results are compared by verifying the mutual correlation the spearman s corre lation test is used because of the small number of chosen points as well to not assume their normal distribution the is quite close to unity notice however that although the luminosity function is best represented as an exponential progression the pair of points of the two compared distribu tions are not necessarily so thus we have also used the f test and the student s t test because these are nonparametric tests since the shape of the curves is obviously similar but not the error bars while the number of points is small the f test for variances is advisable the table of the f distribution indicates that the null hypothesis no difference must be accepted to a large degree of statistical certainty with two exceptions out of the limit redshift those exceptions lie at z 0 87 and z 1 25 for which the null hypothesis certainty is mediocre in both cases that befalls upon the large error bars seeing at the one brightest luminosities the f test without those points give us results 1 64 and 0 92 respectively that take us back to a null hypothesis scenario on views of the outturn of the correlation and variance tests pointing to the agreement of the maxent and control results the two samples student s t test is next justified on this one as table 1 shows in all cases even for the troublesome redsfifts as detected in the previous tests the mnras 000 1 2018 luminosity function in qsos by maxent 5 figure 1 comparison between probabilities calculated from the maxent method and from the control results plots show luminosities on the horizontal axis and probabilities on the

applied to compare their error budgets notice at start that the error bars are asymmetrical and therefore up and down pairs are formed the correlations are poor though they undeniably exist on the other hand the f test and t test for the er rors show the maxent method and the control results faring quite alike also in this respect we thus can further conclude for the independence of the methods

pre sented in this paper to investigate the outcomes for a redshift in which we suppose that data exist only in its vicinity for this simulation the redshift z 3 5 is chosen as shown in figure 2 at this redshift the luminosity l seems to increase again after a drop between z 2 75 and z 3 25 at the same time there are enough input data and good results for the neighbor redshifts from those the mean value lz 3 5 is interpolated and next we will obtain by maxent the distribution of l for the redshift 3 5 mnras 000 1 2018 6 a andrei et al figure 2 mean luminosity in bins of redshift from z 0 5 to z 4 25 derived from sdss dr 3 as in richards et al 2006 not taking into account any corrections for the malmquist bias figure 3 luminosity function obtained from maxent using the fitting curve to z 3 5 in practice we start from the same set of data used before from richards et al 2006 plotting all the avail able redshifts with respective mean luminosities then the curve of best fitting to the observational data is obtained and from this fitting curve we associate a mean luminosity to the redshift aimed at next in order to procure the la grange multipliers and a set of observed luminosities is demanded those were picked up at random from the lumi nosities actually present for the neighbor redshifts the point now is to verify whether using this quite ar bitrary choice the maxent formulation is capable to issue a credible luminosity function we thus compare the maxent formulation results to a direct interpolation of the control re sults and of the maxent results themselves both depicted on figure 1 figure 3 shows these three results it is seen that the maxent formulation based on neighbor data gives a result comparable to the direct interpolation results but at the same time it delivers a smoother curve this type of situation occurs frequently in astrophysics and maxent demonstrates here to be a very useful tool to mnras 000 1 2018 luminosity function in qsos by maxent 7 estimate values what later can be tested later as more data becomes available 6 conclusions the quasar luminosity function is intended as a measure of the actual distribution of quasars in luminosity and redshift for that observational astrophysical and cosmological re stricting factors must be accounted for and often different surveys must be combined before a complete population is inferred that satisfied most quasar luminosity functions available in the literature are represented either by a dou ble power law regimen or by a modified schechter function the adjustments are semi empirical having as usual param eters a normalization factor a break magnitude a reference redshift and bright and faint ends slopes by contrast the maxent method on top of being quite simple to handle offers three strong features first it repre sents a physically distinct approach thus bringing the known benefits of different bias limitations and systematics sec ondly because it is purely statistical it depends of less as trophysical and cosmological assumptions in special the key ones break magnitude and reference redshift thirdly a hall mark of maxent is to deliver trustful conclusions from small samples this last quality is particularly suited to deal with limited dedicated surveys as well as to piece off portions of the luminosity function without further requirements to the mathematical representation of the function itself by the same token it is suited to try out luminosity functions for putative new classes of quasars and their location either within large clusters or relatively isolated in this pioneer derivation we took the sdss dr 3 quasar population and the normalization made by richards et al 2006 there in the luminosity functions and correspond ing curves were used here as control results the compar isons hold very well being practically immaterial whether the whole luminosity population or samples as small as three random elements were used as jaynes has stated that maxent is the generaliza tion of the principle of insufficient reason in our case we show that little information of the system quasars luminosi ties gave us consistent results in so it is an effective way of practical generalization as a result the lagrange multipli ers behaved in a stable manner enabling to use bootstrap ping for determination of errors the aspect of updating the knowledge when of the outcome of a much larger data set as expected from gaia is foreseen to be coherently accom modated as well as to investigate piecemeal the luminosity function

addi tional conditions b 1 and b 2 and the lagrange multipliers and the maximization procedure leads to the following result pi e ai b 5 the two equations that we have to adjust to compute are obtained by taking b 5 into the equations of constraints b 1 and b 2 so we obtain the equations e n i 1 aie ai a b 6 e n i 1 e ai 1 b 7 the equation b 6 inform us that e n i 1 aie ai a b 8 taking b 8 into equation b 7 we obtain an equation in to be solved a n i 1 e ai n i 1 aie ai 1 b 9 to find the obtained values of are taken into b 8 that mnras 000 1 2018 luminosity function in qsos by maxent 9 is the sequence of procedures to find from equation b 9 and substitute it into the equation b 8 to find with both lagrange multipliers found we can get by maxent the resulting probability b 5 and the
