spin orbit synchronous rotation as observed in the case of venus they thus participate to determine the possible climates and general circulations of the atmospheres of these planets aims the thermal tidal torque exerted on an atmosphere depends both on its internal structure and rotation and the tidal frequency particularly it strongly varies with the convective stability of entropy stratification this dependence has to be characterized to con strain and predict the rotational properties of observed telluric exoplanets moreover it is necessary to validate the approximations used in global modelings such as the traditional approximation which is used to obtain separable solutions for tidal waves methods we write the equations governing the dynamics of thermal tides in a local vertically stratified section of a rotating planetary atmosphere by taking into account the effects of the complete coriolis acceleration on tidal waves this allows us to derive analytically the tidal torque and the tidally dissipated energy which we use to discuss the possible regimes of tidal dissipation and examine the key role played by stratification results in agreement with early studies we find that the frequency dependence of the thermal atmospheric tidal torque in the vicinity of synchronization can be approximated by a maxwell model this behaviour corresponds to weakly stably stratified or convective fluid layers as observed in auclair desrotour et al 2017 a a strong stable stratification allows gravity waves to propagate which makes the tidal torque become negligible the transition is continuous between these two regimes the traditional approximation appears to be valid in thin atmospheres and in regimes where the rotation frequency is dominated by the forcing or the buoyancy frequencies conclusions depending on the stability of their atmospheres with respect to convection observed exoplanets can be tidally driven toward synchronous or asynchronous final rotation rates the domain of applicability of the traditional approximation is rigorously constrained by calculations key words hydrodynamics waves turbulence planet star interactions planets and satellites dynamical evolution and stability 1 introduction the end of the year 2016 and the beginning of the year 2017 have been marked by the discovery of potentially habitable earth like exoplanets orbiting two stars located in the close neighborhood of the solar system the first star is proxima centauri where a planet with a minimum mass of 1 3 mc proxima b has been detected anglada escud et al 2016 ribas et al 2016 the second one is the ultra cool dwarf star trappist 1 which hosts seven telluric planets of masses between 0 2 mc and 2 mc and radii between 0 7 rc and 1 2 rc gillon et al 2017 proxima b and trappist 1 e f and g orbit in the habitable zone of their host stars besides they are likely to be covered with an atmo sphere like the earth venus or mars in the solar system their habitability is hence strongly constrained by their atmospheric dynamics i e the general circulation zonal winds which plays a prominent role in the heat transport and determines their cli mate and surface temperature the atmosphere dynamics is tightly related to the rotational dynamics of planets for instance the general circulation of rapidly rotating planets such as the earth is driven by geostrophic flows while planets close to spin orbit synchronous rotation are subject to large scale convective cells that transport heat from the day side to the night side e g leconte et al 2013 it is thus of great importance to characterize the rotational evolution of the observed rocky exoplanets those hosted by trappist 1 are expected to be either tidally synchronized with the star or trapped in a higher order spin orbit resonance since they are submitted to a strong tidal grav itational potential applied on their telluric core gillon et al 2017 however as noted by ribas et al 2016 in the study of proxima b s rotation the stellar irradiation can generate thermal article number page 1 of 12 ar x iv 1 70 9 10 14 8 v 1 as tr o ph e p 2 8 s ep 2 01 7 a a proofs manuscript no adml 2017 atmospheric tides in addition to the standard gravitational tide thermal tides have been proved to be able to compensate the solid tidal torque and to torque the planet away from synchro nization this is the case of venus which is maintained in a ret rograde rotation state of equilibrium by the competition between solid and atmospheric tides gold soter 1969 dobrovolskis ingersoll 1980 correia laskar 2001 2003 auclair desrotour et al 2017 b in a previous study by using a global ab initio modeling we investigated the role played by the structure and properties of the atmosphere in response to a semidiurnal quadrupolar tidal forc ing auclair desrotour et al 2017 a particularly we showed that stable stratification is able to modify the dependence of the atmospheric tidal torque on the tidal frequency these results suggest that the maxwell like 1 frequency dependence obtained by early works with parametrized models ingersoll dobro volskis 1978 correia laskar 2001 or general circulation models or gcms leconte et al 2015 corresponds to the tidal response of a neutrally stratified atmosphere with respect to con vection they also show that a strong stable stratification tends to annihilate the global tidal bulge by allowing gravity waves to propagate so that the resulting atmospheric tidal torque becomes negligible this has large repercussions on the final rotation rate of the planet in the neutrally stratified case an asynchronous ro tation rate can be reached while the solid tide dominates in the second case leading the body to spin orbit synchronization however these tendencies were obtained by considering asymptotic cases neutrally slowly rotating and isothermal stably stratified atmospheres which let the details of the continuous variation of the tidal response with stratification aside more over the global model used to describe the dynamics of tidal waves in this early work is based upon an approximation on the hierarchy between rotation and stratification the traditional ap proximation it consists in neglecting the latitudinal projection of the rotation vector in the coriolis acceleration which allows to integrate separately the vertical and horizontal structure of the tidal response the traditional approximation is not valid for all configurations and its domain of applicability is not clearly es tablished gerkema zimmerman 2008 tort dubos 2014 some of the limitations of the traditional approximation have been identified in geophysical and astrophysical fluid dynam ics gerkema shrira 2005 particularly the general case is fully 2 d and thus the coordinates cannot be separated mathis et al 2014 hence the traditional approximation needs to be validated for thermal atmospheric tides it is thus necessary to develop a tractable model enabling us to explore widely the pos sible stratifications and rotations without any approximation on the coriolis acceleration such a model would also allow us to discuss the different tidal regimes their consequences on the evolution of the rotation rate of a planet and the possible bias resulting from approximations made in the global modeling therefore we propose in this study to characterize the be haviour of the atmospheric tidal torque with respect to stratifica tion in the framework of a 2 d simplified local cartesian mod eling where the effect of rotation is fully taken into account this approach is based on the early works by gerkema shrira 2005 mathis et al 2014 and andr et al 2017 who exam ine the effect of stratification and rotation on waves propagating within planetary oceans stars and gaseous envelopes of giant planets we generalize their formalism to treat the case of strat 1 so called in reference to the maxwell model see e g greenberg 2009 correia et al 2014 r

with vertically dependent hydrostatic equilib rium structures we introduce the physical setup of the local model in sec tion 2 and write the equations describing the dynamics of ther mally generated tidal waves in a planetary fluid layer in sec tion 3 then we derive in section 4 the energy balance asso ciated to a propagating tidal mode in section 5 analytic solu tions are computed in the case of simplified atmospheric mod els namely a homogeneous fluid with uniform background dis tributions and of an isothermal stably stratified atmosphere in section 6 these solutions are used to discuss the possible tidal regimes and the dependence of the atmospheric tidal torque on stratification in the non traditional framework we show that be yond a critical value of the brunt v is l frequency this torque becomes negligible we then illustrate the consequences of this behaviour on the planet s rotation by computing the evolution of this later for various stratifications we end this work with a study of the applicability of the traditional approximation in sec tion 7 that allows us to identify asymptotic regimes where it can be applied finally we give our conclusions in section 8 2 physical setup and background structure following gerkema shrira 2005 and mathis et al 2014 we consider a local volume within a planetary atmospheric layer fig 1 this volume is a cartesian box of side l such that l r r being the planet radius it is rotating uniformly at the angular velocity we denote by the corresponding spin vec tor the position of the fluid box is located in the co rotating frame attached to the body re to xe ye zeu such that ze with the usual system of spherical coordinates pr q where r stands for the vertical coordinate for the co latitude and for the longitude the associated vectorial basis is denoted per e e q to study the dynamics of tidal waves in side the box we use the cartesian coordinates x west east y south north and z vertical positive upward and the associ ated basis pex ey ezq pe e erq finally the time is denoted t for convenience we will use as much as possible the same notations as gerkema shrira 2005 for physical quantities the structure of the layer is described by the background spatial distributions of gravity g pressure p 0 density 0 and temperature t 0 to simplify the problem we assume that these quantities vary with the vertical coordinate z only this corre sponds to ignoring the effects of centrifugal distortion and the article number page 2 of 12 p auclair desrotour et al atmospheric thermal tides and planetary spin day

fluid is a perfect gas so that 1 1 4 as the atmosphere is sup posed to be in solid rotation with the body mean flows are ig nored in this first paper however the internal dissipation due to radiative cooling is taken into account in the maxwell approx imation mentioned above the maximal amplitude of the atmo spheric torque corresponds to equalizing the tidal period tide and an effective thermal time associated with internal diffusive and radiative processes 0 leconte et al 2015 auclair desrotour et al 2017 a these processes can be described at first order by a newtonian cooling as in auclair desrotour et al 2017 a see also lindzen mckenzie 1967 dickinson geller 1968 this introduces a parameter for the efficiency of dissipation the fre quency 0 which is the inverse of the local radiative time of the fluid like the other quantities 0 can vary along the vertical direction see for example pollack young 1975 for venus it will be set to a constant value here for the sake of simplicity the effect of a radiative time varying with altitude on the tidal pertur bation has been studied in the framework of the classical theory of atmospheric tides e g dickinson geller 1968 lindzen mckenzie

velocity field u pu v wq to simplify the equations of dynamics we will use the reduced pressure variations p p 0 and the buoyancy b g 0 instead of p and see e g gerkema shrira 2005 the effect of rotation on the tidal perturbation is taken into account through the coriolis acceleration hence we intro duce the coriolis parameters f 2 cos and f 2 sin and suppose them to be constant in the box which is the so called f plane approximation note that f corresponds to the vertical projection of the rotation vector and f to its latitudinal compo nent which is responsible for the coupling of the latitudinal and vertical structures of tidal waves to make the problem separable and tractable analytically within spherical geometry it is neces sary to assume the traditional approximation i e to ignore this term here the simplified cartesian geometry of the local mod eling allows us to conserve the complete coriolis acceleration that includes terms in f we assume that asynchronous rotation rates are possible only in the vicinity of synchronous rotation in range of forcing pe riods defined by tide 0 this allows us to ignore the ef fects of compressibility and to simplify calculations by apply ing the anelastic approximation spiegel veronis 1960 thus following mathis et al 2014 we neglect the contribution of acoustic waves note that compressibility can nevertheless con tribute to the atmospheric tidal response in a non negligible way in the regime of rapidly rotating bodies where horizontally prop agating acoustic waves can be generated the so called lamb modes finally we assume the so called cowling approxima tion cowling 1941 which consists in ignoring the perturbation of the self gravitational potential the dynamics of the tidally forced fluid response is thus described by

and in an isothermal stably stratified gas in both cases we consider a uni form profile of thermal forcing pj is now a constant for the sake of simplicity as done before in the global model auclair desrotour et al 2017 a such a profile physically corresponds to an optically thin atmosphere homogeneous in composition where the stellar incoming flux is absorbed over the whole depth of the fluid layer is can also be seen in the general case as a zero order approximation of the effective energy input per unit mass generating the thermal tide assuming pj to be constant allows us to reduce the right hand member of the vertical structure equa tion eq 23 to a simple exponential function of the altitude 5 1 in a homogeneous fluid the simplest case is that of uniform background distributions which corresponds to the case studied by gerkema shrira 2005 we assume that 0 h and 0 do not vary with the al titude as a consequence the vertical structure equation reduces to d 2 dz 2 k 2 k n 2 2 2

tidal response of a terrestrial planet we use an impen etrable rigid wall condition at z 0 i e 0 for the upper boundary following shen zhang 1990 we assume that there is no material escape at the top of the atmosphere thus the ob tained solution shall not diverge at z 8 this amounts to eliminating the diverging term of the solution a eikzz be ikzz se i cz 46 where s is the amplitude of the

tidal torque t 9 2 0 i 1 i 0 58 which is normalized so that max t 1 when 0 5 2 in an isothermal atmosphere the isothermal approximation is the zero order approximation of the atmospheric structure of terrestrial planets such as the earth it is also the simplest structure allowing us to examine the repercussions of the variations of background distributions on the tidal response indeed an isothermal atmosphere is char acterized by exponentially decaying density and pressure distri butions and a uniform pressure height scale depending on the temperature hence 0 is now given by 0 pzq se

implications on the rotational dynamics of terrestrial planets in this section we use the results derived in the framework of our cartesian model to explore the domain of parameters and under stand the behaviour of the atmospheric tidal response predicted by the much more complex previous global modelings auclair desrotour et al 2017 a leconte et al 2015 particularly we ex amine the tidal torque exerted on the atmosphere which con tributes to the evolution of the rotation rate of the planet with the torque resulting from the tidal elongation and the viscous friction of the solid core in the vicinity of synchronization the atmospheric and solid tidal torques can balance each other the first one torquing the planet away from synchronous rotation and the second one towards it this can explain the locking of the planet venus at the observed asynchonous retrograde rotation rate gold soter 1969 ingersoll dobrovolskis 1978 do brovolskis ingersoll 1980 correia laskar 2001 2003 if the

fluid tidal response into non wavelike and wavelike part was introduced by ogilvie 2013 in the context of gravitational tides the non wavelike part designates the instantaneous global elongation of the atmosphere and the induced large scale flow while the wave like part encompasses the effects of internal waves gen erated by the forcing and resonances they can induce in the present work the term non wavelike refers to the global elongation of the at mosphere due to the thermal forcing by analogy with the gravitational tidal potential it is however different from the equilibrium tide which designates the tidal response of the fluid in the zero frequency limit 0 2 1 5 1 0 5 0 0 5 1 1 5 2 10 5 0 5 10 t id al to rq ue t n 10 2 s 1 n 10 4 s 1 n 10 6 s 1 n 10 8 s 1 fig 2 normalized tidal

propagating wave 0 7 5 10 7 s 1 leconte et al 2015 and kk 2 with 1000 km however in auclair desrotour et al 2017 a we pointed out the fact that stable stratification is able to annihilate the tidal torque due to the thermal non wavelike tide in the vicinity of synchronization because it induces a wavelike tide composed of gravity waves as a consequence the planet would be led in this case towards synchronous rotation by the solid tide to study this effect the global modeling used in this early study should be completed for two reasons first it describes the tidal atmo spheric response in a spherical geometry this tends to dilute the physics into mathematical aspects second it is based upon the traditional approximation and can be affected by the bias induced by this hypothesis which will be studied in the next section typically when 2 n the traditional approximation can lead us to overestimate the amplitude of the tidal torque as discussed by ogilvie lin 2004 these authors show that the static approximation in which the effect of rotation is ig nored is better in this case following them we used this last ap proximation instead of the traditional approximation to establish the maxwell law in the global model auclair desrotour et al 2017 a hence the local cartesian modeling developed in the present study will allow us to explore the full domain of parameters in rotation and stratification with taking into account the complete coriolis acceleration filtering out complexities due to the spher ical geometry but keeping the key physical ingredients considering the expressions of in the two cases treated in the previous section eqs 48 and 63 we recover the asymp totic regimes observed with global modelings on the one hand in the convective atmosphere limit i e n 2 0 0 the expressions of the tidal torque given by eqs 58 and 71 both reduce to eq 72 i e a maxwell law on the other hand in the stably stratified atmosphere limit n 2 8 1 thus the torque obtained in the case of a uniform background readily tends to zero the case of the isothermal atmosphere is a lit tle bit more complex because we have to take into account the dependence of the vertical wavelengths of tidal gravito inertial waves on the tidal frequency eq 62 shows that kz p q diverges article number page 7 of 12 a a proofs manuscript no adml 2017 in the vicinity of spin orbit synchronization 0 namely kz 9 2 f 2 1 2 if 0 and kz 9 2 f 2 1 2 otherwise as a consequence kz 1 and the third term asso ciated with the propagation of gravito inertial waves in eq 71 becomes negligible we identify here how the tidal torque is flat tened by the stable stratification this behaviour corresponds to the equilibrium thermal tide of a stably stratified fluid region studied by arras socrates 2010 in the case of fluid extra solar planets as demonstrated analytically by arras socrates 2010 the n 2 r g term of the heat transport equation tends to equalize the heat source term j in the equation of energy eq 5 while 0 this means that the local density de creases generated by the thermal forcing are exactly cancelled by the vertical displacement of denser fluid brought up from be low this behaviour is illustrated by figs 2 and 3 where the case of the stellar semidiurnal thermal tide is examined the planet is supposed to orbit its host star circularly at the orbital fre

tidal response pre dicted by early studies ingersoll dobrovolskis 1978 correia laskar 2001 auclair desrotour et al 2017 a and in the sec ond one violet curve the weak torque obtained with the ab ini tio modeling of auclair desrotour et al 2017 a that takes tidal gravity waves into account several resonances can be observed in the transition regime they result directly from the equality of characteristic frequen cies of the system n 2 2 which occurs in the denominator of the parameter they are related to the local nature of the model since their positions depend on the colatitude and conse quently do not exist in the global tidal response where the tidal equation is integrated over the sphere auclair desrotour et al 2017 a however we have to characterize them here to clarify the tidal torque frequency spectra observed in fig 2 in the regime of large wavelengths 1 the denominator of eq 63 can be approximated by d n 2 1 2 2 2 f 2 73 let us assume 0 which corresponds to the quasi adiabatic regime press 1981 auclair desrotour et al 2015 and substi tute 2 p norbq in eq 73 resonances thus correspond to the zeros of the polynomial p p q sin 2 2 2 norb n 2 orb 1 2 2 n 2 74 we obtain the roots 1 sin 2 norb c n 2 orb cos 2 1 2 2 n 2 sin 2 ff 75 which expressed in the normalized tidal frequency p norbq norb used in fig 2 become cos sin 2 cos d 1 1 2 2 n norb 2 tan 2 fi fl 76 in the limit n 2 0 they tend to tan 2 1 and sin 2 as a consequence 1 and 8 at the poles these features are represented on the right panel of fig 3 where the tidal torque is plotted as a function of the tidal fre quency and brunt v is l frequency in logarithmic scale black vertical dashed lines indicate the positions of resonances while the horizontal dashed line designates the transition be tween the flat and maxwell like regimes for the tidal torque identified above which corresponds to n t f u for the evolution of planetary systems this means that rocky planets with an atmospheric brunt v is l frequency below this criti cal value are likely to tend towards non synchronized rotation states of equilibrium like venus while those beyond it will be led towards spin orbit synchronization in good agreement with predictions obtained in auclair desrotour et al 2017 a sec tion 6 3 in the right panel of fig 3 the imaginary part of the sur face pressure oscillation is plotted as a function of and n this plot shows that we retrieve the asymptotic behaviours identified for the tidal torque in surface pressure oscillations in a weakly stratified atmosphere a net tidal bulge appears leading to sur face pressure oscillations of high amplitude in agreement with the lag of the bulge in the strongly stratified regime pressure os cillations vanish as there is no net tidal bulge anymore however we note that tppu has not the same functional form as the tidal torque besides one should bear in mind the fact that it partly depends on the chosen boundary conditions which prevents us to proceed to a more quantitative analysis to illustrate the impact of the atmospheric structure on the long term rotational evolution we study the evolution of the ro tation rate of an idealized venus like rocky planet submitted to both atmospheric and solid semidiurnal tides due to a host star as the goal of these calculations is to isolate the different possi ble evolutions we choose simple values of parameters we use for the solid torque the simplified model expressed as ts ts 0 tanh s 77 where ts 0 5 0 1016 n m designates the amplitude of the torque and s the effective relaxation frequency of the mate rial composing the rocky core this model can be interpreted as a zero order approximation of the andrade model andrade 1910 efroimsky 2012 leconte et al 2015 which describes the forced visco elastic response of metals and silicates the re laxation frequency of a rocky planet is usually far smaller than the orbital frequency s 10 10 s 1 e g efroimsky 2012 here we set s 10 2 norb in the andrade model the decay ing rate of the tidal torque is far smaller than the one of the at mosphere for s so it is well approximated by a constant in the vicinity of synchronous rotation concerning the atmo spheric torque we apply eq 71 with the effective radiative fre quency 0 3 norb and the amplitude ta 0 1 52 ts 0 which is arbitrarily chosen in such way that the final

results are plotted in fig 4 as a function of time we can observe in this figure that rotational evolutions divide into two distinct families the first family 4 which en compasses strongly stratified cases is driven by the solid tidal torque solely in this family the rotation rate invariably con verges towards synchronous rotation 0 planets of the sec ond family 5 5 are driven by both solid and atmospheric tidal torques the evolution rate of their spin varies depending on the strength of the atmospheric tidal torque which tends to push the planet away from synchronous rotation they finally reach a stable non synchronized state of equilibrium corresponding to the frequency where the solid and atmospheric torques exactly balance each other we can notice two evolutions behaving in a different way than those detailed above namely 4 5 and 5 these cases are associated with the transition regime in the first one 4 5 a non synchronized state of equilibrium closer to synchronization is reached while the rapid evolution of in the second one 5 around t 600 myr results from one of the resonances studied above see eqs 73 to 76 we note that the rotation tends towards synchronization in this case in the general case it seems difficult to predict the final ro tation rate of the planet using the formula given by eq 71 however it can be done in the asymptotic regime described by 0 2 4 6

horizontal and vertical structures of the tidal response induced by the coriolis acceleration in global modelings e g chapman lindzen 1970 auclair desrotour et al 2017 a however the regime of parameters where the approximation is appropriate still remains only partially deter mined early studies generally agree on the fact that the approx imation can be applied if 2 that is in the regime of super inertial waves where the fluid tidal response is weakly affected by the rotation of the planet it has also been shown that the above condition could be extended to 2 in the case of a stably stratified fluid n e g friedlander 1987 mathis et al 2008 mathis 2009 prat et al 2017 we propose here to quantify the conditions of applicability of the traditional approximation by establishing the boundaries of its domain of validity as a function of the characteristic fre quencies of the system i e 0 2 n and of the length scale ratio in light of the expressions of the dissipated power and tidal torque given in eqs 70 and 71 the dimensionless parameter introduced in eqs 48 and 63 appears as a key parameter to characterize the domain of validity of the traditional approxima tion indeed it intervenes in an essential way in d diss and t and contains all the information concerning the hierarchy of charac teristic frequencies and control parameters of the system there fore considering that the impact of the traditional approximation on obtained results is directly related to the variation of with f we adopt as index of validity the normalized relative difference between the parameters ta and nta corresponding to the cases with f 0 and without f 0 the traditional approximation respectively the subscripts ta and nta stand for traditional approximation and no traditional approximation respectively which is expressed as ta nta ta nta 80 in this approach the condition of validity of the traditional ap proximation is 1 otherwise neglecting the latitudinal pro jection of the rotation vector strongly modifies the tidal response leading to 1 and the traditional approximation should be abandoned the parameter is plotted in fig 5 as a function of the fre quencies ratios n 2 and for asymptotic values of 0 and the length scale parameter kk angles are set to 12 and 2 the values taken by are indicated by colors blue regions indicate the domain of parameters where the traditional approximation can be applied 1 while red ones designate regimes where it is not relevant 1 hence we note that the traditional approximation is appropriate what ever the hierarchy of characteristic frequencies if the wavelength of the mode is far greater than the pressure height scale i e if article number page 10 of 12 p auclair desrotour et al atmospheric thermal tides and planetary spin 1 this is due to the fact that the term p 1 2 q 2 2 f 2 is always far greater in this case than terms associated with the latitudinal component of the coriolis acceleration in the denom inator of d n 2 2 f 2 s f pi f sin cos q 81 1 2 2 2 f 2 this suggests that the traditional approximation is well adapted to the treatment of the tidal response of thin atmo spheres where the horizontal wavelength of dominating propa gating modes is comparable to the radius of the planet in order of magnitude in the case of small wavelengths 1 we recover the domain of validity established by early studies 2 if the layer is weakly stably stratified or convective n and 2 in the case of strong stable stratification n par ticularly the bottom left panel of fig 5 show that the boundary of the domain of validity of the approximation corresponds to 2 n in the regime of strong stable stratification which is in good agreement with the diagnosis done in auclair desrotour et al 2017 a fig 21 this boundary is slightly modified by the radiative diffusive cooling top left panel with a downward translation of magnitude p 1 2 q log p 0 q resulting from the equality of the dominating terms of eq 81 p 0 qn 2 f 2 s 8 conclusions motivated by the understanding of the role played by thermally forced gravity waves in the atmospheric tidal response of a ter restrial planet submitted to the irradiation of its host star we have studied the tidal perturbation of a local atmospheric sec tion in solid rotation with the body in this ab initio approach inspired by gerkema shrira 2005 and mathis et al 2014 the dynamics of tidal waves are reduced to the essentials which allowed us to conserve the whole physics of tides and particu larly all the components of the coriolis acceleration while avoid ing complexities associated with spherical geometry the goal of this work was to provide a diagnosis of the results obtained in our previous global analytic study auclair desrotour et al 2017 a where two asymptotic regimes were identified a weakly strati fied regime inducing a maxwell like tidal torque applied on the atmosphere and a strongly stably stratified one associated with a weak torque we wrote the linearized equations of tides for a fluid section characterized by radial background distributions and dissipative processes modelled with a newtonian cooling as in auclair desrotour et al 2017 a we computed analytic solutions de scribing the forced oscillatory response in two typical cases a homogeneous fluid with uniform background distributions and an isothermal atmosphere in both cases the tidal torque exerted and the energy dissipated by diffusive radiative processes were also derived analytically we showed that tidal regimes are de fined by a small number of physical parameters namely the tidal inertia 2 brunt v is l n and radiative 0 frequen cies and the ratio between the horizontal wavelength of a prop agating tidal wave and the pressure height scale of the fluid considering the semidiurnal stellar tide we recovered the results obtained with global modelings in early works the de pendence of the tidal torque on the forcing frequency can be de scribed by a maxwell model in the vicinity of spin orbit syn chronous rotation leconte et al 2015 auclair desrotour et al 2017 a in the case of weakly stably stratified or convective at mospheres if the stratification is strong gravito inertial waves are generated this wavelike response breaks the large scale quadrupolar hydrostatic elongation caused by the stellar heat ing at zero order so that there is no net tidal bulge as a con sequence the amplitude of the tidal torque diminishes and be comes negligible compared to the convective case this sug gests that venus like planets with a stably stratified atmosphere are likely to tend towards spin orbit synchronous rotation while those with a convective atmosphere rather evolve towards non synchronized states like venus as predicted by the model of auclair desrotour et al 2017 a hence the cartesian approach allows us to explore the domain of parameters to confirm the previously identified asymptotic regimes and to highlight the continuous transition between them this transition occurs for n t 0 u in the case of venus itself the structure of the atmosphere is characterized by a strong negative tempera ture gradient near the surface of the planet seiff et al 1980 this implies that the densest layers of the atmosphere which are also the better viscously coupled to the solid part are neutrally stratified hence our simplified modeling suggests in this case a strong atmospheric torque that agrees with the conclusions of early works dealing the rotation of venus e g gold soter 1969 dobrovolskis ingersoll 1980 correia laskar 2001 auclair desrotour et al 2017 b by isolating in obtained solutions a characteristic scaling pa rameter we were also able to delimit the domain of valid ity of the traditional approximation used in global models as a function of the system s control parameters and to character ize the asymptotic regimes in the short wavelengths approxi mation we recovered the domain of validity identified in early studies namely the validity conditions 2 in the case of weakly stratified fluids and 2 n in the case of strongly strat ified ones friedlander 1987 mathis et al 2008 mathis 2009 auclair desrotour et al 2017 a this domain is slightly modified by dissipative mechanisms in this case in the long wavelength asymptotic regime where the pressure scale height is smaller than the horizontal wavelength of a propagating mode we found that the coriolis terms neglected in the traditional approximation do not affect the tidal response except at the boundary of the in ertial regime defined by 2 this result is appropriate to characterize the forced response of the fluid up to meso scale modes that is the application limit of the f plane approximation used in our modeling therefore the impact of the traditional approximation on global tidal modes should be studied in gen eral with global modelings as done by ogilvie lin 2004 in the case of giant planets or tort dubos 2014 for atmospheric dynamics however the local approach developed here still remains an efficient way to peer into the large domain of parameters of at mospheric tidal responses and to clarify the predictions of global modelings obtained with assumptions indeed it offers a sim plified but robust picture of the tidal waves dynamics with the essential physical ingredients its predictive power on the rota tion state of exoplanets as a function of the convective stability of their atmosphere is of great interest with their probe by forth coming space missions like jwst lagage 2015 such missions will be able to provide constraints on the temperature gradient at different depths in the atmospheres of exoplanets thanks to multi wavelenght observations in the near ir in forthcoming studies we will complete this picture by including in the carte sian fluid section stratified background flows these flows are likely to strongly modify the atmospheric tidal response but can article number page
