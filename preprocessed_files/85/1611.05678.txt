obspm fr stephane mathis cea fr correia ua pt received accepted abstract the competition between the torques induced by solid and thermal tides drives the rotational dynamics of venus like planets and super earths orbiting in the habitable zone of low mass stars the resulting torque determines the possible equilibrium states of the planet s spin we compute here an analytic expression for the total tidal torque exerted on a venus like planet this expression is used to characterize the equilibrium rotation of the body close to the star the solid tide dominates far from it the thermal tide drives the rotational dynamics of the planet the transition regime corresponds to the habitable zone where prograde and retrograde equilibrium states appear we demonstrate the strong impact of the atmospheric properties and of the rheology of the solid part on the rotational dynamics of venus like planets highlighting the key role played by dissipative mechanisms in the stability of equilibrium configurations key words celestial mechanics planet star interactions planets and satellites dynamical evolution and stability planets and satellites atmospheres 1 introduction twenty years after the discovery of the first exoplanet around a solar type star mayor queloz 1995 the rapidly growing population of detected low mass extra solar planets has become considerable and their number will keep increasing which gen erates a strong need for theoretical modeling and predictions because the mass of such planets is not large enough to al low them to accrete a voluminous gaseous envelope they are mainly composed of a telluric core in many cases e g 55 cnc e see demory et al 2016 this core is covered by a thin at mospheric layer as observed on the earth venus and mars the rotation of these bodies strongly affects their surface tempera ture equilibrium and atmospheric global circulation forget leconte 2014 therefore it is a key quantity to understand their climate particularly in the so called habitable zone kasting et al 1993 the rotational dynamics of super venus and venus like plan ets is driven by the tidal torques exerted both on the rocky and atmospheric layers see correia et al 2008 the solid torque which is induced by the gravitational tidal forcing of the host star tends to despin the planet to pull it back to synchronization the atmospheric torque is the sum of two contributions the first one caused by the gravitational tidal potential of the star acts on the spin in a similar way as the solid tide the second one called thermal tide results from the perturbation due to the heating of the atmosphere by the stellar bolometric flux the torque in duced by this component is in opposition with those gravitation ally generated therefore it pushes the angular velocity of the planet away from synchronization although the mass of the at mosphere often represents a negligible fraction of the mass of the planet denoting fa this fraction we have fa 10 4 for venus thermal tides can be of the same order of magnitude and even stronger than solid tides dobrovolskis ingersoll 1980 this competition naturally gives birth to prograde and ret rograde rotation equilibria in the semi major axis range defined by the habitable zone in which venus like planets are submit ted to gravitational and thermal tides of comparable intensities gold soter 1969 dobrovolskis ingersoll 1980 correia laskar 2001 early studies of this effect were based on analyt ical models developed for the earth e g chapman lindzen 1970 that present a singularity at synchronisation while cor reia laskar 2001 avoid this drawback by a smooth interpo lation annuling the torque at synchronization only recently the atmospheric tidal perturbation has been computed numerically with global circulation models gcm leconte et al 2015 and analytically auclair desrotour et al 2016 p 1 who gen eralized the reference work of chapman lindzen 1970 by including the dissipative processes radiation thermal diffusion that regularize the behaviour of the atmospheric tidal torque at the synchronization here we revisit the equilibrium rotation of super earth plan ets

consider a planet in a circular orbit of radius a and mean motion n around a star of mass m and luminosity l exerting on the planet thermal and gravitational tidal forcing fig 1 the planet of mass mp and spin has zero obliquity so that the tidal frequency is 2 where n it is com posed of a telluric core of radius r covered by a thin atmospheric layer of mass ma famp and pressure height scale h such that h r this fluid layer is assumed to be homogeneous in com position of specific gas constant ra rgp m rgp and m being the perfect gas constant and the mean molar mass respectively in hydrostatic equilibrium and subject to convective instability i e n 0 n designating the brunt v is l frequency as ob served on the surface of venus seiff et al 1980 hence the pressure height scale is h rat 0 g 1 where t 0 is the equilibrium surface temperature of the atmo sphere and g the surface gravity which are related to the equi librium radial distributions of density 0 and pressure p 0 as p 0 0 gh we introduce the first adiabatic exponent of the gas 1 pb ln p 0 b ln 0 qs the subscript s being the specific macroscopic entropy and the parameter 1 1 1 the ra diative losses of the atmosphere treated as a newtonian cooling lead us to define a radiative frequency 0 given by jrad cp 0 t 2 where cp ra is the thermal capacity of the atmosphere per unit mass and jrad is the radiated power per unit mass caused by the temperature variation t around the equilibrium state it shall be noticed here that the newtonian cooling describes the ra diative losses of optically thin atmospheres where the radiative transfers between layers can be ignored we apply this modeling to optically thick atmosphere such as venus one because the numerical simulations by leconte et al 2015 show that it can also describe well tidal dissipation in these cases with an effec tive newtonian cooling frequency for more details about this physical set up we refer the reader to p 1 core atm gravita onal poten al insola on

assumed to be constant the thick atmosphere of a venus like planet absorbs most of the stellar flux in its upper regions which are as a consequence strongly thermally forced only 3 of the flux reaches the surface pollack young 1975 how ever the tidal effects resulting from the heating by the ground determine the tidal mass redistribution since the atmosphere is far denser near the surface than in upper regions dobrovol skis ingersoll 1980 shen zhang 1990 these layers can also be considered in solid rotation with the solid part as a first approximation because the velocity of horizontal winds is less than 5 m s 1 below an altitude of 10 km marov et al 1973 so introducing the mean power per unit mass j 2 we choose for the thermal forcing the heating at the ground distribution j j 2 je j xp

as the one given by ingersoll dobrovolskis 1978 eq 4 the quadrupolar tidal gravitational potential and heat power are given by p 1 eq 74 u 2 1 2 c 3 2 r 2 gm a 3 and j 2 1 2 c 3 2 r 2 l maa 2 4 where g designates the gravitational constant the effective fraction of power absorbed by the atmosphere and a shape fac tor depending on the spatial distribution of tidal heat sources 1 the tidal torque

synchronization eq is given by eq paq m d a a 20 m a m a with a 12 rat 0 m rk l p 1 kq 10 as a first approximation we consider that parameters a 0 and m do not vary with the star planet distance in this frame work the equilibrium of synchronization is defined for all orbital radii while those associated with eq 10 only exist in a zone delimited by ainf a asup the boundaries being ainf a 0 1 and asup a 0 11 with the ratio max p 0 m m 0 q in the particular case where 0 m the distance aeq a 0 corresponds to an or bit for which the atmospheric and solid tidal torques counterbal ance each other whatever the angular velocity of the planet studying the derivative of eq eq 10 we note that when the star planet distance increases if m 0 the pseudo synchronized states of equilibrium get closer to the synchronization if m 0 they move away from it to determine the stability of the identified equilibria we in troduce the first order variation such that eq and study the sign of ts a at the vicinity of an equilibrium position for a given a we first treat the synchronization for which ts a 9 sign a aeq with aeq a 20 m 12 note that aeq ainf if 0 m and aeq asup otherwise at the vicinity of non synchronized equilibria we have ts a 9 n 4 m 2 eq 20 2 m 2 eq 2 m 2 2 eq 2 0 13 therefore within the interval a p ainf asup if m 0 the synchronized state of equilibrium is stable and the pseudo synchronized ones are unstable if m 0 the synchronized state of equilibrium is unstable and the pseudo synchronized ones are stable for a ainf the gravitational tide predominates and the equi librium at n is stable it becomes unstable for a asup because the torque is driven by the thermal tide 3 2 comparison with previous works in many early studies dealing with the spin rotation of venus the effect of the gravitational component on the atmosphere is ignored so that the atmospheric tide corresponds to a pure ther mal tide e g dobrovolskis ingersoll 1980 correia laskar 2001 correia et al 2003 2008 cunha et al 2015 moreover the torque induced by the tidal elongation of the solid core is generally assumed to be linear in these works this amounts to considering that m and 0 m hence the relation eq 10 giving the positions of non synchronized equilibria can be simplified eq c m a a 20 14 following correia et al 2008 we take 0 0 we then obtain eq 9 a while correia et al 2008 found eq 9 a this difference can be explained by the linear approximation of the sine of the phase lag done in this previous work given that the condition 0 m is satisfied the non synchronized states of equilibrium are stable in this case by using a global circulation model gcm leconte et al 2015 obtained numerically for the atmospheric tidal torque an expression similar to the one given by eq 3 they computed with this expression the possible states of equilibrium of venus like planets by applying to the telluric core the andrade and constant q models and showed that for both models up to five equilibrium positions could appear this is not the case when the maxwell model is used as shown by the present work hence although these studies agree well on the existence of several non synchronized states of equilibrium they also remind us that the theoretical number and positions of these equilibria depend on the models used to compute tidal torques and more specifically on the rheology chosen

unit mass proportional to cos on the day side and equal to zero on the night side the atmospheric tidal torque is assumed to be entirely transmitted to the telluric core 1 is consistant with the estimation of dobrovolskis ingersoll 1980 for the effective heating of venus atmosphere by the ground and we take for g the shear modulus of silicates remus et al 2012 4 the case of venus like planets we now illustrate the previous results for venus like planets ta ble 1 the frequency m is adjusted so that the present angular velocity of venus corresponds to the retrograde state of equilib rium identified in the case where the condition m 0 is satis fied in eq 9 in fig 3 we plot the resulting tidal torque and its components as well as their signs as functions of the tidal frequency and orbital radius these maps show that the torque varies over a very large range particularly the solid component ts 9 a 6 while ta 9 a 5 the combination of the solid and atmospheric responses generates the non synchronized states of equilibrium observed on the bottom left panel which are located in the interval ainf asup see eq 11 and move away from the synchronization when a increases see eq 10 as predicted an alytically for illustration in fig 4 we show the outcome of a different value of m with 0 m contrary to fig 3 where m 0 we observe the behaviour predicted analytically in sect 3 in fig 3 the non synchronized equilibria are stable and move away from the synchronization when a increases but they are unstable in fig 4 note that the value of the solid maxwell frequency ob tained for stable non synchronized states of equilibrium m 1 075 10 4 s 1 is far higher than those of typical solid bodies m 10 10 s 1 see efroimsky 2012 the maxwell model because of its decreasing rate as a function of i e 9 1 underestimates the tidal torque for tidal frequencies greater than m which leads to overestimate the maxwell frequency when equalizing atmospheric and solid torques using the andrade model for the solid part could give more realistic values of m as proved numerically by leconte et al 2015 because the de creasing rate of the torque is lower in the andrade model than in the maxwell model i e 9 with 0 2 0 3 finally we must discuss the assumption we made when we supposed that the parameters of the system did not depend on the star planet distance the surface temperature of the planet and the radiative frequency actually vary with a if we con sider that t 0 is determined by the balance between the heat ing of the star and the black body radiation of the planet then t 09 a 1 2 as 09 t 30 we have 09 a 3 2 these new depen dences modify neither the expressions of eq eq 10 nor the stability conditions of the states of equilibrium eqs 12 and 13 however they have repercussions on the boundaries of the re gion where non synchronized states exist this changes are il lustrated by fig 4 bottom panel which shows the stability diagram of fig 3 bottom left panel

analytically the possible rotation equilibria of venus like planets and their stability two regimes exist depending on the hierarchy of the characteristic frequencies associated with dissipative processes viscous friction in the solid layer and ther mal radiation in the atmosphere these dissipative mechanisms have an impact on the stability of non synchronized equilibria which can appear in the habitable zone since they are caused by solid and atmospheric tidal torques of comparable intensi ties this study can be used to constrain the equilibrium rota tion of observed super earths and therefore to infer the possible climates of such planets also here the maxwell rheology was used this work can be directly applied to alternative rheolo gies such as the andrade model efroimsky 2012 the mod eling used here is based on an approach where the atmosphere is assumed to rotate uniformly with the solid part of the planet auclair desrotour et al 2016 as general circulation is likely to play an important role in the atmospheric tidal response we envisage to examine the effect of differential rotation and corre sponding zonal winds of the tidal torque in future studies
