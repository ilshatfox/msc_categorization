tenu de l nergie cin tique importante qu acquiert le vent durant son lancement seule une fraction du vent verra son cours s rieusement d vi par l intervention fortuite du champ de pesanteur de l objet

de diff rencier rayonnements thermique et non thermique 6 si l toile et les r gions internes du disque mettent effectivement dans des gammes de longueur d onde bien distinctes dans les binaires x de faible masse il est plus difficile de s assurer de cette s paration dans le cas des binaires x de forte masse o l toile est plus chaude et la g om trie du flot accr t plus incertaine de surcro t d autres struc tures tel qu un jet peuvent aussi contribuer au spectre dans des intervalles et proportions variables parce que le spectre observ est int gr sur une zone de l espace o cohabitent une

juxtaposer des zones d mission pr d finies couronne disque point chaud etc dont on ajuste les param tres pour pouser le spec tre observ le grand nombre de variables en jeu et l absence de

appel wind accretion dans la suite de ce manuscrit part i physical objects numerical tools 13 introduction in this preliminary part we introduce basic notions about the definition of a compact object and what makes its gravitational influence so special compared to other bodies of similar mass ultimate stages of the stellar evolution compact objects harbor physical conditions on the fringe of current fundamental laws at our disposal those cheeky collapsed remnants in an expanding universe set among the privileged stages to enlarge the realm of our imagination they bridge the gap between the so called two infinities with macroscopic objects displaying quantum behaviors such as neutron stars for lack of an adapted theoretical framework and of accessible analogous objects to rely on the way matter is organized in those objects is still subject to speculation even more challenging is the physical censorship which sets the close vicinity of a black hole out of straightforward observational reach a major technological leap forward would not be enough to make the contents of an event horizon directly observable this pessimistic statement can however be bypassed if one agrees to appeal to an intellectual work around similar to the one which formerly unveiled the physical origin of thermodynamics unsatisfied with the answers of the xixth century physics the atomists with boltzmann ahead resorted to a discrete representation of fluids in spite of the impossibility for direct observations to back up the atomic hy pothesis the reluctance of the community to corpuscular 11 approaches was reinforced by the apparent renouncements it seemed to involve the numbers of particles at stake in available systems were so large that kinetic theories would bar newtonian mechanics from being of any concrete help statistical physics could offer distributions but no singular prediction the indeterministic cat 12 was among the positivist pigeons the epistemological profitability of the atomic approach forgave this apostasy afterwhile the observational inaccessibility of compact objects has fueled the inventiveness of modelers theo reticians and observers for decades in an attempt to grasp their surroundings numerical physicists can now join the struggle by making a previously chimeric dream come true designing essential ersatzes which encapsulate all the potentialities set by the physical laws encoded and delegating to the computing facilities the responsibility to deploy a contingent seed into an effective system modern supercomputers enable us to push computing limits above levels unthinkable a decade ago the scope of application of numerical simulations expands day after day and brings up fundamental questions about the very object of science the post newtonian theories of physics plunged the observer into the formalism by making the measurement a physical problem quantum mechanics seized a notoriously informal domain while general relativity was shaking the convenient absoluteness of static space and time numerical simula tions involve the physicist a step farther by making her summon virtual avatars of the world she intends to understand the technical core of this phd thesis thus deserved at least an overview to familiarize the reader with the everyday concerns of numerical astrophysics in the first chapter we describe the intrinsic properties of accreting compact objects and illustrate their capacity to convert gravitational potential energy into radiation it will be the occasion to shed some light on the privileged status of high energy astronomy to observe those systems we then proceed with a description of several environments in which those objects are found with an emphasis on x ray binaries the astrophysical counterpart of the model developed in the last part of this manuscript the evolutionary 11 sealed by the accomplishments of wave optics and later on electromagnetism 12 in this case it is an indeterminism introduced by the modeling the dynamics of a given particle is fully determined by the equations and the initial conditions but our effective incapacity to follow it makes any singular prediction about this particle mean ingless a few decades later another cat would engrave indeterminism in the physical laws themselves 15 16 questions pertaining to compact objects are postponed to chapter 7 where we address the formation of x ray binary systems for the moment we embrace a static approach to describe compact bodies with an emphasis on their generic properties in nominal regimes whose characteristic drift time is large compared to the observational times of x ray binaries the numerical tools used to investigate those systems are briefly discussed in the last chapter of this

the physical topics covered in this phd gravity will play the leading role which makes the latter interpretation the most insightful if we set the potential at infinity to zero the difference between the newtonian gravitational potential 7 at the surface r r of a spherical astrophysical body and of an ob server at infinity is given by when compared to c 2 r r c 2 gm rc 2 1 2 where m and r are the mass and the radius of the body respectively g the gravitational constant and is a dimensionless number called the compactness parameter in agreement with the aforementioned exclusive regimes of application of relativity the closer gets to 1 the more pressing is the need for a relativistic framework note that relies on a non relativistic expression of the gravitational potential but it can be shown that below moderately high values of the compactness parameter 10 its value is essentially unaltered by the use or not of relativity 8 we can also interpret this parameter in terms of velocities by considering the newtonian escape velocity at the surface of the body with respect to the speed of light vesc c 2 gm rc 2 p 2 1 3 which motivates the introduction of a characteristic radius 9 the

this comment must be considered with precautions when one gets interested in a secular effect of gr like the preces sion of mercury the instantaneous influence of gr over a newtonian approach is vanishingly small but once integrated over a large number of dynamical periods it plays a decisive role 9 it is also the radius of the event horizon of a black hole bh the radius of the bh itself is set by convention to gm c 2 such as 1 for a bh 10 by massive we mean which has a measured mass strictly positive 11 where we considered the classical radius obtained by balancing the rest mass energy with the electrostatic binding energy 12 usually we start to speak about compact bodies when the degenerancy pressure starts to play a role for 10 4 which makes the white dwarfs in cataclysmic variables for instance belong to this category 13 more exotic theoretical objects such as boson stars grandcl ment et al 2014 can also be considered as compact objects http www lmj cea fr en lmj index

physical objects with representative radii and masses along with their compactness parameter the presence of the electron in this table serves to convince the doubtful reader about the non redundancy between the concepts of mass density and compactness the radius given for the bh is the one of its event horizon for a schwarzschild bh i e non rotating and the compactness is set to 1 by convention cretors studied in this phd thesis if those objects themselves must be studied through the prism of gr their surroundings do not always require a relativistic treatment per se sometimes a pseudo newtonian approach can be sufficient to grasp preliminary features a handy way to implement this intermediate framework 14 is to write the gravitational potential produced by a point mass m with the paczyn ski wiita potential paczyn sky and wiita 1980 pw r gm r a for r a 1 5 where a is a degree of freedom which stands for a domain of extension of the relativistic regime of the order of the schwarzschild radius the associated force is still centered and conservative 1 1 2 formation all other forces neglected any massive system is doomed to collapse over a dynamical timescale d under the action of gravity the shrinking of the radius at a constant mass makes the compactness parameter rise and it soon reaches relativistic values 1 the characteristic duration of this collapse for a system of mass m and initial radius and density r and respectively can be derived using kepler s third law applied to a test mass on a degenerate orbit of eccentricity almost 1 and of semi major axis r 2 d 1 2 2 r 2 3 gm 3 32 g 1 6 as visible in figure 1 1 this dynamical time is always much smaller than the actual life expectancy of the system considered 15 for the sake of the newtonian world the intercession of effectively repulsing forces guarantees the existence of a broad range of intermediate equilibria not doomed to enter the relativistic realm within a dynamical timescale for instance stars can maintain as long as the thermonuclear fusion in their core sustains thermal or for the most massive ones radiative pressure to counterbalance gravity 14 initially introduced to model a schwarzschild black hole but extensions to a rotating black hole exist see references in the review by abramowicz and fragile 2013 15 apart maybe for collapsing molecular clouds with densities of a few millions atoms per cubic centimeter where the free fall time is of the order of a few hundreds of thousands years 20 chapter 1 accreting compact objects figure 1 1 free fall or dynamical time as a function of the average density of the system it corresponds to the time it takes to collapse if gravity is the only force on stage it ranges from a few hours for a sun like star to a fraction of a millisecond for a pulsar each time it runs out of nuclear fuel after a laps given by the nuclear timescale 16 the core contracts while the outer layers expand and the higher temperature reached triggers the ignition of a larger atomic number element 17 buying some additional time to the star 18 at some point though the core reaches the electronic for wd or neutron for ns degeneracy limit when the distance between particles becomes of the order of the thermal de broglie wavelength if the electronic pressure of degeneracy can take over and stabilize the wd for ns it takes the strong interaction between baryons to compensate for the gravitational field as the outer layers bounce back on the surface of the newly formed ns they are ejected at important speeds a core collapse supernova occurs as specified in table 1 1 the radii which result from these combined actions 19 are above the schwarzschild radii of the objects i e 1 the stellar structure for instance can be appreciated up to a sophisticated level of understanding without a relativistic description nevertheless if the mass of the collapsing core is too important the strong interaction between baryons is not enough to stop gravity from bringing the compactness parameter to fully relativistic values a black hole is formed surrounded by an event horizon 20 to summarize in a final stand whose modalities strongly depend on the mass of the star but also on its metallicity its angular momentum the exhausted star collapses into either 1 a white dwarf for initial stellar masses below 10 m 16 which can be computed by estimating the efficiency of e g the proton fusion and the rest mass of the combustible typically 10 of the total mass with respect to the stellar luminosity the former requires to follow

extrapolate the fate of a given set of stars stellar evolution if the initial stellar mass is the key parameter to appreciate stellar evolution with a precision of an order of magnitude observations highlighted systematic biases from a population to another 22 see e g demory et al 2009 for low mass stars it made the case for additional not so hidden parameters in the stellar models such as the chemical composition the angular momentum the magnetic field the binarity etc in particular for high mass stars i e above a few solar masses the mass is believed to significantly decrease from the initial one over the stellar lifetime 23 which itself must be narrowly determined to know when the compact object forms indeed while the sun emits a thermally driven wind see parker s model described in lamers and cassinelli 1999 at a rate of 10 14 m yr 1 massive stars undergo radiatively driven winds with much larger mass loss rates see chapter 6 this very non conservativeness of the mass of stellar bodies among the most likely to give compact objects emphasizes the need to surpass the classical models describing the collapse of a star takes a reliable stage initial mass function the mechanism which leads from a cold and dense molecular cloud to a proto star conditions the initial mass function imf the initial mass distribution of a stellar population just formed see the recent review by kroupa et al 2011 and the widely used imf given by chabrier 2003 the underlying fragmentation of the turbulent interstellar medium is an ongoing topic of research which makes the most of multi scale and multi physics simulations abel et al 2000 it is believed that this imf which nowadays strongly favours low mass stars in the milky way 24 was different in the past with a bias towards much larger initial masses 25 schneider et al 2002 21 with respect to the observational capacities 22 for instance between stars of the milky way and the peripheral galaxies smc small magellanic cloud and lmc large magel lanic clouds the latter two displaying lower metallicities than our galaxy wood et al 1998 23 in spite of the dramatically shorter life expectancy of massive stars 24 97 of presently formed stars are below the threshold of 10 m to ultimately form a ns and a fortiori a bh 25 with gravitational collapses of 100 m stars being possible physical sources of some of the observed hypernovas 22 chapter 1 accreting compact objects stellar formation rate the stellar formation rate sfr indicates how fast free gas in the interstellar medium is converted into stars similarly to the imf it can be constrained through the combined investigation of large scale numer ical simulations vogelsberger et al 2014 and galactic observations starburst galaxies suggest that this rate can punctually skyrocket for instance due to galactic mergers genzel et al 2010 a 1 1 4 objects neutron stars figure 1 2 fluxes of the black body surface ther mal emission for a 10 km

using the webtool webplotdig itizer the shaded area at the bottom corresponds to an estimate of the current photometric sensitivity limit see text for details neutron stars are compact remnants of the iron core of massive stars whose collapse was stopped by the disruption of the nuclei into nucleons the subsequent neutronization of the protons by elec tronic capture and the resulting repulsive force be tween baryons 26 the average mass density of those objects exceeds the nucleus mass density a few 1014 g cm 3 and the compactness parameter reaches a couple of 10 given the extreme condi tions associated to this macroscopic object whose structure must be studied using quantum chro modynamics in a relativistic framework the equa tion of state of the ultra dense matter they con tain well approached by a barotropic one is still an active field of research a strong observational constrain on the equation of state is the maximum mass of the neutron star chamel et al 2013 in deed like the chandrasekhar limit for wd there is a mass above which stable ns can not exist the first computation of this upper limit was made by tolman oppenheimer volkoff in 1939 the tov limit and although it gave a value too low to val idate their model it paved the way to more elab orated models of the interactions at stake in this exotic state of matter each of them gave birth to a mass radius relationship some of them being rep resented in figure 1 3 and more importantly to a maximum mass which can be confronted to obser vations the maximum masses derived all lie ap proximately within 1 6 and 3 m any body heavier than the latter is thus considered to be a black hole candidate 27 not a neutron star if ns have an initial surface temperature much higher than the stellar photospheres they quickly cool down figure 1 2 see also zavlin 2007 for a review on thermal emission from isolated neutron stars due to their small radii 10 km their glare does not carry very far the ns which are detected only from their surface thermal emission all lie within a few 26 related to the pauli exclusion principle since baryons belong to fermions martin 2007 27 by the denomination candidate we want to emphasize the fact that the exclusive property of bh the existence of an event horizon has not been confirmed yet for any of the available candidates however the recent detection of two gravitational wave signals in spectacular agreement with the signals expected for a binary bh coalescence provides strong if not definitive support in favor of the existence of black holes

equations of state of the matter in a ns they all display different maximum masses albeit in a narrow range compared to our capacity to accurately measure the mass of a ns from lattimer 2010 100 pc indeed let us take as an indicative guideline the sensitivity of a state of the art satellite as kepler although its nominal waveband is not the one adequate for the observation of a hot young neutron star the kepler satellite observes up to an apparent magnitude 28 of 15 as a reference for the bolometric limit it corresponds to a conservative 29 flux detectability limit of approximately 10 11 erg s 1 cm 2 given the figure 1 2 it means that we can only detect very young 10 000 years neutron stars at a kiloparsec but we can go up to one million years at 100 pc we count approximately 10 objects detected only with their surface thermal emission including the so called magnificient seven most isolated ns are actually observed thanks to their large magnetic field and rotation frequency and are called radio pulsars 30 if the magnetic and rotation axis are misaligned the beamed 31 light emitted by the rotating dipole will sweep a specific circular region of the sky analogous to the way a lighthouse sweeps its beam of light around in a circle it taps the kinematic energy of rotation of the solid body and induces a magnetic braking which is measured and consistent with this scenario see figure 1 4 thus isolated neutron stars 32 do not have a rich enough environment to interact with to make the measure of decisive parameters such as their mass robust 28 with the flux of vega of the order of 2 erg s 1 cm 2 to scale it 29 in practice for low flux objects the issue is not the detectability itself but the physical back and foreground luminosity levels the blends the lower the luminosity of the source the larger the relative contribution of the neighbourhood along the line of sight 30 psr b 1919 21 a k a lmg 1 for little green man 1 being the first pulsar recognized as such the pulsar lying at the core of the crab nebula is probably one of the more studied of them 31 along the magnetic axis 32 see mereghetti 2010 for a review on isolated neutron stars 24 chapter 1

lines are guidelines issued from theoretical models not described in the present manuscript see e g daigne 2015 from lorimer and kramer 2005 only a fraction of ns are expected to be found orbiting a stellar companion indeed when the neutron star forms the departure from isotropicity of the explosion 33 provides a non zero kick velocity to the com pact object with respect to its companion possibly large enough to disrupt the binary system tauris and takens 1998 janka 2013 grefenstette et al 2014 hirai et al 2014 the spatial distribution of isolated pulsars in the milky way with a larger dispersion around the galactic plane than the gas and population i stars supports this scenario the couples which survive the supernova explosion are goldmines since the mass transfer and orbital modulation of the emission are additional phenomena where the neutron star properties play a major if not a leading role it becomes possible provided the influence of the plentiful parameters can be disentangled to trace back for instance the mass of the neutron star eventually as mentioned earlier neutron stars present huge magnetic fields and short spin periods indeed conservation of angular momentum and the freezing flux theorem shu 1992 guarantee pro vided the fraction of the total mass ejected during the collapse remains modest r 2 p r 2 p b r 2 b r 2 1 7 where p b and r refer to the spin period associated to a spin angular velocity the magnetic field and the radius respectively of either the star subscript or the compact remnant subscript if we take the solar orders of magnitude as guidelines with a spin period of 25 days and a polar magnetic field of 1 g applied to a 10 r progenitor we get the following values for the newly formed neutron star p 4 10 6 s b 5 1011 g 1 8 if the magnetic field is consistent with what is observed for young x ray binaries pulsars 34 the spin period is well below the actual initial spin periods at birth of those objects of the order of a few 10 ms actually 33 see scheck et al 2004 and scheck et al 2006 for two dimensional numerical simulations of neutrino driven core collapse supernovae and wongwathanarat et al 2010 and wongwathanarat et al 2013 for an extension to three dimensional simulations 34 slightly below according to figure 1 4 which would suggest for example larger magnetic fields for more massive stars 1 1 compact objects 25 with this spin period the centrifugal force disrupts the body indeed if we compare the gravitational binding energy of an object of mass m and the rotational energy 35 erot mr 2 2 we get the following

values applied to a 10 m star the minimum radius is of one thousand times larger than the size of the neutron star a more realistic approach would have been to consider only the core or the central sphere containing m 1 5 m the future mass of the ns if we refer to table 1 of heger et al 2005 who estimate the pre supernova angular momentum of this sphere to 1049 erg s we have if we assume a differential rotation i e p 1 r 2 for the core m r 2 p 8 1049 erg s p 200 ms 1 10 we retrieve a more realistic value of the initial spin period of a ns a first comment to be made though is that the iron core is believed to follow a more solid than differential rotation more importantly blondin and mezzacappa 2007 have shown that angular momentum is redistributed during the collapse because of the standing accretion shock instability 36 sasi blondin et al 2003 concerning the structure of the magnetic field around the neutron star different models exist daigne 2015 we expect the flow structure to be shaped by the magnetic field once it reaches the magnetosphere of the body whose radius can be evaluated in the following way see frank et al 2002 section 6 3 bal ancing ram pressure

ray luminosity of the system is introduced in section 1 2 2 within this region the dynamics of the flow is dominated by the coupling between the ionized gas and the magnetic field the plasma is channelled along the field lines which breaks up an eventual geometrically thin and optically thick structure of the flow see section 1 2 2 the impact of the inflow on the polar caps of the neutron

processes responsible for piling up of electric charges in a bh spin measurements albeit still discussed within the community have started to blossom reynolds 2014 to unveil the second key parameter of bh 42 they invite us to think that rapidly rotating 43 bh are not rare an important feature of rapidly rotating bh which impacts the accretion phenomenon and in particular wind accretion is the existence of an innermost stable circular orbit isco whose position differs for a co and a counter rotating disk 44 around a kerr bh see figure 1 5 and the applet designed by leo c stein figure 1 5 position of the isco with respect to the schwarzschild radius as a function of a parameter which quantifies the bh spin along the central line the bh has no angular momentum schwarzschild metric and the isco is located three times farther than the event horizon which has a size equal to the schwarzschild radius for a rotating bh kerr bh a rotating flow which swings from co to counter rotating can extend down to a different minimal radius due to the non invariance of the isco by a swing in bh spin i e equivalently in the rotation direction of the flow 41 the deformation of the iron 6 4 kev

duetosymmetry com tool kerr isco calculator 1 2 accretion 27 below this orbit the disk structure can no longer subsist and the flow quickly spirals in since most of the light emitted by an accretion disk comes from its inner parts see section 1 2 2 and if the inner edge of the disk matches the isco 45 it means that switches between the two regimes of rotation imply observationally distinguishable spectra and luminosity the main trigger of this swing could be a large scale hydrodynam ical instability called the flip flop instability 46 illustrated in figure 1 6 foglizzo et al 2005 1 2 accretion 1 2 1 the kelvin helmholtz conversion process the ubiquity of gravitation in astrophysics promotes accretion to the rank of the unavoidable mecha nisms in this manuscript we use the word accretion to refer to the fall of a continuous medium gas or plasma in a gravitational potential produced by an external 47 massive body before considering a proper fluid we compute the change in the specific 48 gravitational potential energy of a test mass which would go from infinity to the surface of the compact object of radius r ep g ep g r ep g dep g ep g r ep g 0 by convention gm r c 2 1 12 since the mechanical specific energy of the test mass em is conserved this decrease in the absolute value of gravitational potential energy results in an increase in the specific kinetic energy of the particle of the order of for a particle with a negligible velocity at infinity compared to the one at the surface of the object em 0 ec ep g 1 13 hence ec ec r ec dec ec r c 2 1 14 this rise in specific kinetic energy is of the order of the specific rest mass of test mass c 2 for a compact object 49 a few 10 of the rest mass of the particle has been converted into kinetic energy which makes accretion onto a compact object the most efficient energy conversion process 50 in a fluid this sudden surge in velocity will go with a heating of the flow and thus with a significant emission of light see section 1 2 2 we then conveniently define the accretion luminosity lacc as the maximum luminosity associated to an object of compactness accreting with a mass accretion rate m lacc m c 2 1036 erg s 1 m 10 10 m yr 1 1 15 part of the gravitational potential energy can also be reinjected in the jets kinetic energy or swallowed by the bh since the energy carried by the flow as it crosses the event horizon takes an infinite amount of time to be released for the observer 51 see the advection dominated accretion flow model for instance with narayan et al 1998 45 it is also possible as suggested by yamada et al 2013 to account for the low hard states of cygnus x 1 that the inner disk is truncated well beyond the isco which would jeopardize the analysis sketched here 46 although it is sometimes compared to the oscillations running along a flag or the von k rm n vortex street livio et al 1991 one must keep in mind that in the current case i the geometry is spherical and three dimensional and ii the conditions at the surface of the accretor are not trivially reflecting ones see section 5 2 in chapter 5 47 self gravity of the accreted flow can be neglected in x ray binaries the skeptical reader could verify it by using the equation 5 49 of frank et al 2002 to evaluate the mass stored in a disk for instance and compare it to the mass of the accretor 48 applied to an energy this adjective means per unit mass in this manuscript 49 once again this newtonian argumentation is qualitatively unchanged in the relativistic framework 50 in comparison nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium peaks at 0 7 see the aforementioned gamow s derivation 51 energy is effectively trapped including under its radiative form because of the relativistic gravitational reddening 28 chapter 1

amrvac see chapter 3 the col ormap represents the gas density and the arrows stand for the velocity field the bluer the faster the mesh with 6 levels of refinement is overplotted a disk structure forms around the accretor and after a sudden flushing phase a similar disk with reverted angular momentum forms 1 2 accretion 29 this energy conversion process was first designed well before the relativistic notion of compactness bore any physical relevance in the xixth century the rising interest in geology brought up the question of the age of the earth and by then of the sun whose formation is believed to be concomitant 52 kelvin helmholtz suggested that the luminosity l of the latter was due to the gravitational contraction of the whole body which provides the following age estimate for a constant luminosity through time ep g now ep g ini dep g l ep g ini ep g now l ep g now l with ep g ini ep g now 1 16 where ep g now is the gravitational binding energy of the sun today for a uniform sphere of gas density and radius r the gravitational binding energy can be derived by considering the successive addition of layers of infinitesimal mass dm 4 r 2 dr ep g now r r 0 gm r r dm 3 5 gm 2 r where m r m r r 3 is the mass already added 1 17 using the virial theorem daigne 2015 it can be shown that up to half of this energy can be radiated as the body contracts 53 which gives an estimate of the age of the earth 20 myr 1 18 this estimate was already incompatible with the geological and darwinian timescales required to explain the observations available at that time which were advocating in favour of larger and eventually more realistic ages nuclear power turned out a few decades later to be a more realistic process to account for stellar luminosities at least on the main sequence indeed the kelvin helmholtz mechanism is believed to be the main culprit to explain the luminosity of proto stars 54 1 2 2 light emission luminosity we have seen that the luminosity of accreting compact objects could reach 1036 erg s 1 260 l provided they were fed significant amounts of gas m 10 10 m yr 1 we leave the question of the source of matter for chapter 2 and 7 and portray the case of the steady disk 55 model introduced by shakura and sunyaev 1973 the angular momentum of the accreted flow is high enough to make the inflow form a geometrically thin and optically thick disk around the accretor this landscape which serves as a reference for accretion theory will not be described in detail in this manuscript but is precisely documented in frank et al 2002 the computation we carry on in this section also owes much to j n winn s course 8 901 given at mit during the second term of year 2011 2012 luckily enough we will see in a moment that most of the light emitted by this structure turns out to be when the accretor is a compact object in the x ray domain well above the energy range of the stellar spectrum of the companion in an x ray binary for instance the disk itself is not the only structure expected around a compact accretor 56 in particular for a low angular momentum flow nor the only one to radiate high energy photons however the disk model is a convenient framework which proved useful 52 see the laplace nebular theory of planetary formation woolfson 1993 53 the other half is added to the internal energy of the body 54 before the core reaches temperatures high enough to trigger on thermonuclear fusion 106 k for hydrogen the cloud keeps collapsing under the action of gravity 55 refers to a degree of freedom of the problem which stands for an effective viscosity due to the turbulence triggered by the magneto rotational instability for instance balbus and hawley 1991 it is a necessary feature to guarantee the transport of angular momentum outwards and by then the possibility for matter to spiral in indeed molecular viscosity can be shown to not be large enough to account for outwards transport of angular momentum see section 4 7 of frank et al 2002 56 the system can display among others jets markoff et al 2003 internal shocks cohen et al 2014 a stellar and a disk wind a corona or a hot spot in stream dominated mass transfers 30 chapter 1 accreting compact objects to explain a substantial number of observational configurations and more specifically the multi color black body observed in many cases see next section for synthetic spectra in chapter 5 frank et al 2002 shows that the effective black body temperature of the disk at a distance r of the accretor of mass m accreting at a rate m is given by t r 3 gm m 8 r 3 1 rin r 1 4 1 19 where is the stefan boltzmann constant and rin is the position of the inner edge of the disk that being said we can start to quantify more rigorously 57 the accretion luminosity associated to this configuration if the outer edge of the disk is much farther away from the accretor than the inner edge we have ltot rout r rin t 4 r 2 2 r dr 1 2 gm m rin 1 20 where we summed over all the black body rings of infinitesimal surface 2 r dr 2 since upper and lower faces and where rout refers to the outer border of the disk without surprise if the disk extends down to the surface of the accretor i e rin r we retrieve the standard expression of the accretion luminosity given by equation 1 15 the factor 1 2 being due to the fact that we now work on a system which has an internal structure and energy i e where thermodynamics and the virial theorem preclude that more than half of the variation in gravitational potential energy goes in the bulk motion of the flow a decisive feature of those discs at least from an observational point of view is that most of the luminosity comes from the inner parts of the disk indeed if we compute the ratio l r ltot of the luminosity being emitted by the disk below a certain radius r i e the cumulative luminosity with respect to the total luminosity we get l r ltot 2 rin gm m r rin t 4 r 4 r dr 3 x 1 1 p 1 x x 2 dx with

spectrum a classical preliminary remark about the spectral range of the emitted light due to the accretion process is to distinguish the optically thick case treated in more details below and the optically thin case in the latter configuration where the disk is secondary if not absent the emission is simply associated to the thermal energy of all the particles of mean weight per particle of the order of the mass of a proton mp related to the change in gravitational potential energy via the virial theorem 3 2 kb tthin 1 2 gm r 1 22 kb tthin gmmp 3 r 69 mev 1 23 where kb is boltzmann s constant as mentioned in section 1 1 4 the diversion of the rotating flow within the magnetosphere of a neutron star can lead to the accretion of an optically thin flow susceptible to 57 in the previous section 1 2 1 we used a test mass but did not address the flow as a continuous medium 1 2 accretion 31 figure 1 7 fractional luminosity of a steady disk below a radius r in units of the inner radius of the disk according to 1 21 most of the light is emitted by the inner parts of the disk hotter due to the strong dependence of the black body flux on the temperature t 4 account for very high energy photons this gamma ray emission is indeed observed in several systems but is not always believed to be the main source of light which often finds its origin in the process we now describe let us compute the spectrum itself of the source 58 assuming that the emitted spectrum at the surface of the disk is not altered by any other structure 59 the radiative theory notions used here are

it can be used once the reflection on the disk is studied to estimate the inner radius of the disk and by then the spin of the bh reynolds 2014 https heasarc gsfc nasa gov xanadu xspec 32 chapter 1 accreting compact objects in figure 1 8 the left column corresponds to the case of a disk of smaller radial extension i e lower angular momentum than the right column where the outer edge is of the order of the radius of the roche lobe see chapter 7 three distinct regime can be seen a first fast rise in 2 corresponding to the low energy tail of the outermost black body emission at a temperature t rout a flat multi color black body component made of the piling up of black bodies with temperatures between t rout and t rin and an exponential cut off beyond the energy corresponding to the innermost temperature t rin notice that given its low luminosity the position of the outer edge has little influence on the spectrum since it does not modify the high energy part most of the time it is not observationally constrained directly with the spectrum but rather with a host spot or with the theoretical upper limit of 70 of the roche lobe radius a k a the disk tidal truncation radius given by paczynski 1977 indeed if the spectrum is at the same level of specific intensity the actual luminosity 60 is several orders smaller than the portion associated to the high energy part of the spectrum 61 a more visible feature is the cutoff at the inner edge of the disk which moves from 10 km surface of a ns on the upper row to 1 000 km surface of a white dwarf or the ns magnetosphere see section 1 1 4 on the lower row where the emission in x rays is vanishingly small since the stellar companion in an x ray binary emits partly in ultraviolets especially for a hot companion in a high mass x ray binary see section 2 1 2 in the next chapter it challenges our very capacity to distinguish the contribution of the disk in addition of being on the whole less luminous according to equation 1 20 for the total luminosity a final comment before presenting accreting compact objects in their environment as suggested by figure 1 5 if the position of the inner edge of the disk follows the one of the isco a sudden swing in the angular momentum of the flow which feeds the disk would have dramatic effects around a maximally rotating bh indeed the inner border would then be almost ten times farther away from the accretor when the disk is counter rotating with respect to the bh spin than when it is co rotating photometrically it would correspond to a luminosity almost ten times smaller 62 while spectroscopically the cutoff drops by a factor of a few for an inner edge rising from 10 to 100 kms 60 i e after having integrated over frequencies much narrower for the radiation emitted by the outer edge it is a reason why observers sometimes prefer to plot the product of the frequency by the specific flux 61 hence a total luminosity in equation 1 20 which essentially depends on the position of the inner edge of the disk not of the outer edge 62 like for an eclipsing system though dilution effects play a role if there are other x ray sources in the system such as a corona around the disk which is usually fitted by a power law as usual the integrated luminosity is merely a hint of what the full light distribution i e the spectrum looks like 1 2 accretion 33 figure 1 8

discovered by giacconi et al 1962 sco x 1 turned out to be an accreting compact object in a binary system isolated compact objects generally display signals too quiet to be detected with the current technology but in interaction with their environment a rich phe nomenology blossoms in a first section we introduce the physical stage which is the central one in this manuscript the x ray binaries the vast family of the x ray binaries has long ramified into observational and physical branches that we will briefly summarize the accent will be put on successive dichotomies which include the archetype of systems where wind accretion occurs supergiant x ray binaries con cerning the x ray sources not related to binary systems the second half of this chapter is devoted to a few astronomical objects susceptible to be well represented by some of the numerical setups we designed and where the present numerical work might be relevant 2 1 x ray binaries 2 1 1 the accretor as explained in section 1 2 2 the accretor has to be a compact object to account for such an emission of high and very high energy photons i e x rays and beyond the accreting body plays a role through its gravitational influence and is hardly responsible directly for the radiations we observe what we witness is the emission of the flow being accreted it is why it has been suggested that the environment of the com pact object could serve as a probe to investigate its dantean neighborhood and maybe unveil unexpected 35 36 chapter 2 x ray sources behaviour in strong gravity regime however such an aim can only be reached if we manage to delimit the variability inherent to the inflow and dig for systematics behind the scenes the vast majority of compact accretors are neutron stars 1 a diagnosis which can rely on several argu ments first many of those neutron stars manifest themselves as accreting pulsars in particular in high mass x ray binaries see section below not to be confused with radio pulsars which tap their emission energy from the ns rotation the magnetic field is large enough typically 1011 g to funnel the accreted gas to the magnetic poles where it produces tiny regions of bright and high energy emission see the ac cretion columns in pringle and rees 1972 davidson and ostriker 1973 as they spin with the neutron star since the magnetic field is not aligned with the spin axis the amplitude of the emission is modu lated and pulses at the neutron star spin period appear in the light signal the magnetic field can even be evaluated validating the above scenario by using the cyclotron resonant scattering absorption lines observed in those systems 2 second the dynamically deduced masses are consistent with the conclusions drawn by core collapse models and the maximum masses set by the available equations of state for the ultra condensed matter of ns finally spectroscopic arguments can be used to differentiate an accreting ns from an accreting bh the former is characterized by a power law of photon index 0 3 to 2 and a high energy exponential cutoff with cyclotron resonance scattering features at higher energies walter et al 2015 2 1 2 hmxb lmxb the two main families of x ray binaries depend on the mass of the companion star 1 low mass x ray binaries lmxb the companion star is of low mass at most a couple of solar masses but more generally below one solar mass the corresponding spectral type is a or later 2 high mass x ray binaries hmxb the companion star is of high mass above several solar masses usually above 10 m the corresponding spectral type is b or earlier the lmxb then host stars older than hmxb due to the slower evolution of lower mass stars while the age of the star is typically of less than 10 millions years in hmxb lmxb host stars older than a few billions years 3 since the hmxb are younger the magnetic field of the ns they host if it is not a bh is still large the accretion columns are brighter and more extended and a pulsar is more likely to be detected than in lmxb where the magnetic field is lower concerning their spatial distribution in the milky way hmxb appear very close to the galactic plane while lmxb have a broader galactic latitude distribution if the more venerable age of lmxb partly explains this discrepancy it is not a sufficient reason as emphasized by podsiadlowski 2014 indeed the main element is the kick provided to the system by the non spherical collapse of the naked helium core into a neutron star for systems which remain bounded after the associated supernova explosion it results in larger kicks for lower mass systems i e the lmxb in addition because of the longer lifetime of low mass stars a lmxb will be able to travel further away than a hmxb brandt and podsiadlowski 1995 showed that x ray binaries born in the galactic plane with realistic mass distributions reproduce well the observations when the same ns kick velocity distribution is adopted for all binaries for the spatial distribution within the galactic plane coleiro and chaty 2013 used a spectral energy distribution fitting procedure in optical and near infrared to derive the distance and absorption of a statistical sample of 1 the two first suspected candidates were the accretors in the roche lobe overflow high and intermediate mass x ray binaries respectively cen x 3 and her x 1 the few accreting black hole candidates will be mentioned in 2 1 5 2 they are caused by the scattering of hard x ray photons on electrons whose energy is quantified by the magnetic field according to the landau levels see e g wasserman and shapiro 1983 for the theoretical framework and walter et al 2015 for an overview of observations of this feature in galactic hmxb 3 see section 7 2 for a more detailed discussion on the secular evolution of a stellar binary system into an x ray binary in par ticular the remarkable bimodality of the stellar mass distribution of those systems with few intermediate mass x ray binaries is discussed there 2 1 x ray binaries 37 figure 2 1 zoom in around the sun red star set at 8 5 kpc of the galactic center with the spiral arms in light gray the blue stars with the black lines represent the positions of the hmxb in coleiro and chaty 2013 with the uncertainty on the distance from coleiro 2013 hmxb as visible in figure 2 1 there is a correlation between the position of the hmxb and the stellar formation zones e g the spiral arms another feature concerns the mass transfer from the star to the compact companion responsible for the x ray bright emission most of the time the spectrum is softer in lmxb with photon energies 10 kev than in hmxb 15 kev which invite us according to the arguments developed in section 1 2 2 to sup port the existence of a robust and large optically thick geometrically thin disk like structure around the compact object in lmxb not necessarily in hmxb the presence of this disk in lmxb is supported by the mechanism of roche lobe overflow rlof described in chapter 7 more likely to be stable in lmxb than in hmxb in the latter wind accretion see chapter 8 is believed to be the main culprit for mass transfer with much lower subsequent angular momentum for the inflow eventually jets have been observed mostly in lmxb but also in hmxb 4 the compact accretor can be either a bh e g grs 1015 105 or a ns e g sco x 1 different mechanisms exist to explain those ejections of matter highly beamed and at velocities sometimes of the order of the speed of light an electromagnetic equivalent of the penrose extraction process to tap the spin energy of kerr bh in the ergosphere blandford and znajek 1977 or a wind from a magnetized accretion ejection structure blandford and payne 1982 casse and keppens 2002 those systems are called microquasars which refers to a subfamily of active galactic nuclei the quasars 38 chapter 2 x ray sources figure 2 2 estimates of the numbers of observed hmxb in the milky way classified as bexb or sgxb before and after the integral mission from walter et al 2015 2 1 3 sgxb bexb among hmxb an additional distinction is made between two main categories depending on the nature of the high mass star see also the review by chaty 2011 indeed until the integral satellite 5 most hmxb observed hosted a specific kind of b star 6 characterized by high spin rates many strong balmer lines in emission and an infrared excess coe 1999 porter and rivinius 2003 reig 2011 they are called be stars 7 and the hmxb where they are found bexb the star spins fast enough to get close from its breaking limit and a decretion disk responsible for the emission lines and the infrared excess forms in the equatorial plane see the skecth in figure 2 3 all bexb host a ns as an accretor on an eccentric orbit 0 3 usually inclined with respect to the stellar equatorial plane bexb are generally transient sources with a quiescent level at 1034 erg s 1 they display periodic x ray type i bursts up to 1036 erg s 1 at the orbital period of the orbiting neutron star bottom panel in figure 2 3 which can be explained by the passage of the ns through the decretion disk where the mass density is higher the x ray luminosity levels reached are consistent with a wind accretion process 8 however some of those sources also display non periodic larger bursts type ii up to an x ray luminosity of 1037 erg s 1 which are believed to feature transient massive accretion of the stellar extended atmosphere in a way reminiscent of the roche lobe overflow in lmxb 9 4 cygnus x 1 cygnus x 3 and ss 433 5 for international gamma ray astrophysics laboratory launched in 2002 6 more precisely the star is generally between o 9 and b 3 7 where the e stands for emission lines 8 through this manuscript by wind accretion we mean not only the accretion of a stellar wind but also any mode of accretion where the kinetic energy of the flow with respect to the accretor at large distance of it is important compared to the magnitude of the gravitational potential energy of the compact object at the bondi radius i e the flow is supersonic at infinity and compared to the angular rotation speed of the system if it is in a binary it covers the framework established by bondi hoyle and lyttleton for instance see chapter 4 9 indeed with an eccentric orbit a star can fill or not its roche lobe depending on the phase of the orbit 2 1 x ray binaries 39 figure 2 3 representation of a bexb with a neutron star on an eccentric orbit around a non rlof be star the misalignement between the stellar and orbital spins implies intermittent crossings of the decretion disk by the neutron star which produces an orbital time modulation of the x ray flux bottom part from tauris and van den heuvel 2003 these events are typically accompanied by large spin up rates that suggest the formation of a transient accretion disk around the ns see the correlation in figure 2 4 the second family generally more persistent contains the archetypes of the wind accreting x ray sources the companion star is an evolved ob supergiant hence the name sgxb and the accretor on a low eccentricity orbit 0 2 is either a ns most of the time or a bh the orbital periods are shorter than in bexb 10 days in sgxb hosting a ns a handy tool to differentiate sgxb and bexb is the corbet diagram corbet 1984 which represents the spin period of the neutron star as a function of the orbital period for observed values figure 2 4 is an updated version of this diagram for galactic hmxb mostly based on the measured gathered in walter et al 2015 the main results highlighted by this figure are the following 1 bexb present a correlation between the orbital period and the spin of the ns which suggests that the angular momentum transfer is efficient and the mass transfer conservative it was suggested by waters and van kerkwijk 1989 that it was a manifestation of the propeller effect introduced by illarionov and sunyaev 1975 a negative feedback locks the ns spin period such as the corotation velocity at the magnetospheric radius matches the keplerian velocity the orbital periods span from a couple of 10 days up to a few hundred days 2 the few hmxb undergoing roche lobe overflow only one in the milky way cen x 3 with short or bital periods see section 2 1 5 host fast rotating pulsars with very short spin periods an accretion disk is believed to be a favoured transitional structure to guarantee an optimal transfer of orbital angular momentum to the spin of the ns significantly accelerating it 3 the sgxb systems show no trace of correlation between orbital and ns spin periods suggesting an in efficient mass transfer mechanism consistent with wind accretion highly non conservative they also have shorter orbital periods consistent with the secular evolutionary tracks the ns spin peri ods are rather long above 100 s 40 chapter 2 x ray sources the position in this diagram is by itself an argument to classify a source as a sgxb or a bexb when we dif ferentiate between the two based on the eccentricity of the ns orbit one has to keep in mind that the circu larization of the orbit is an on off mechanism with a rather sharp threshold see section 7 3 and figure 7 15 in particular indeed the capacity of an orbit to circularize within the stellar lifetime see equation 7 22 is very dependent on the ratio of the stellar radius by the orbital separation and the stars in bexb are both smaller and associated to longer periods which makes circularization over the nuclear timescale essen tially ineffective contrary to sgxb which turn out to be below the threshold for circularization however notice that non eccentric bexb would lead to truncated decretion disks with lower outer radii and thus much lower peak x ray luminosities as the ns intersects a lower density environment negueruela and okazaki 2000 even if they existed their detection would be observationally challenging 2 1 4 classical sgxb obscured sgxb sfxt among the sgxb are found several classes depending on the time variability of the x ray emission and the absorption properties due to the reduced number of sgxb it is the last available classification up to now with 3 main families in figure 2 2 among the 36 confirmed sgxb in 2015 11 to 18 are persistent sgxb the classical ones 6 to 9 are highly obscured sgxb and the rest are mostly superfast x ray transients sfxt walter et al 2015 the latter family presents fast outbursts with rise times of the order of a few ten minutes and with typical durations of a few hours negueruela et al 2006 their quiescent level is much lower than the other two families at an x ray luminosity of 1032 to 1034 erg s 1 sidoli et al 2008 of the order of the observational limit of sensitivity however the dynamic range of the flares is also much higher between 102 and 104 which makes them transiently detectable at x ray luminosity levels up to 1037 erg s 1 since they are in a non detectable quiescent state most of the time it took a field of view as large as the one provided by the integral satellite to identify those low duty cycle systems the flares being separated by weeks the outburst spectra are consistent with accreting ns even if the possibility that some systems host a bh can not be ruled out when no pulsation has been detected their positions in the corbet diagram see figure 2 4 does not follow neither the classical sgxb nor the bexb ones which brings up the question of their evolutionary bonds with those two families it has been proposed that those flares can be caused by serendipitous accretion of clumps in the wind of the supergiant stellar companion walter and zurita heras 2007 ducci et al 2009 albeit the overdensities alone are not expected to match the high dynamic range factors a physical distinction between sfxt and classical sgxb has been proposed by negueruela et al 2008 relying on the relative size of the accretion radius of the compact object see chapter 4 relatively to the characteristic size of the clumps in the wind of the supergiant stars because the latter varies with the distance to the star the orbital separation would make the ns lie either in a homogeneous or in a hetero geneous environment relatively to its propensity to accrete matter the obscured sgxb are sources with hydrogen column densities tens times larger than the values as sociated to other sgxb up to several 1024 cm 2 chaty 2011 filliatre and chaty 2004 showed that the absorption of x rays was due to material in the vicinity of the compact object while the absorption in infrared and optical was linked to a cocoon of dust enshrouding the whole system chaty and rahoui 2012 2 1 5 outliers and bh in sgxb given the large number of parameters able to influence the behaviour of a wind accreting binary excep tions are the rule four main kinds of exceptions deserve to be mentioned walter et al 2015 1 the systems where the stellar parameters do not fit the frame previously sketched for sgxb gx 301 2 is one of them hosting a very evolved hypergiant star possibly on its way to a wolf rayet stage due 2 1 x ray binaries 41 figure 2 4 corbet diagram of galactic hmxb hosting a ns the ns spin is represented as a function of the orbital period of the binary for systems where both are measured for bexb green squares a correlation exists between the two not in the case of sgxb blue dots in the bottom left part of the figure is the only rlof system among this sample red cross cen x 3 see van der meer et al 2007 for a joint study of two other rlof hmxb hosting a neutron star smc x 1 and lmc x 4 both extragalactic sfxt and systems with an atypical donor star have also been represented the three circled sgxb are the sources investigated in more details in chapter 8 42 chapter 2 x ray sources to the enormous mass loss rate of the star the system can afford a much larger orbital separation than the other sgxb see figure 8 1 and still be detectable on the other extremity of the range are found more modest main sequence and giant donor stars 2 the systems where the stellar wind present atypical properties for instance oao 1657 415 hosts a star with a wind anomalously low at 250 km s 1 van loon et al 2001 3 the systems where the accretor is not a ns but a bh candidate which is the likely scenario for a few sgxb cyg x 1 orosz et al 2011 cyg x 3 and ss 43310 if the gravitational influence of a ns and a bh are extremely similar beyond a few schwarzschild radii of the object 11 the objects themselves present structural differences 12 which manifest in the accretion or ejection mechanism 4 the systems where the mass transfer is stream dominated i e proceeds through a roche lobe over flow like configuration rather than wind dominated as in most sgxb cen x 3 smc x 1 and lmc x 4 are the main representatives of this category boroson et al 2000 van der meer et al 2007 those systems often display spectra indicative of the presence of a disk the main responsible for the scarcity of those systems is probably the expected instability of this mass transfer when a ns accretes matter from a supergiant companion see section 7 2 2 2 2 other x ray sources other kinds of extrasolar x ray sources exist which are not found in x ray binaries but are believed to be linked to accretion onto a compact object the brief overview which follows intends to remind the reader about the ubiquity of this wider astrophysical situation 2 2 1 runaway stellar mass compact objects increasing numbers of hypervelocity stars have been observed i e stars with a velocity in the galactic rest frame larger than 400 km s 1 and doomed to escape the galactic gravitational potential tauris 2015 those objects support the existence of runaway compact objects whose formation would have disrupted the binary system and provide the hypervelocity star with a large amount of linear momentum 13 tauris and takens 1998 bexb with ns orbiting their high mass stellar companion on a modest eccentricity orbit have been observed pfahl et al 2002 pointing towards a specific core collapse process hardly providing any kick to the ns nevertheless we expect most ns to receive a kick velocity at birth of the order of a few hundreds of kilometers per second lyne et al 1994 monitoring of the proper motion of statistical num bers of pulsars confirmed those figures and a few of them can be linked to a nearby supernova remnant such as igr j 1104 6103 figure 2 5 the pulsar then rushes through the interstellar medium at supersonic speeds in its rest frame it undergoes a wind accretion mechanism see chapter 8 similar to the one of a ns travelling in the high speed wind of its stellar companion though in a more planar fashion in the second part of this manuscript we introduce a planar numerical setup of wind accretion which matches the structure of the incoming flow at large distance of a runaway compact object however in the case of a young accreting ns the pulsar wind not taken into account in our setup plays an important role in the shaping of the inflow to our knowledge no runaway bh candidate has been detected up to now possibly due to the lower formation rate of bh compared to ns and to their larger inertia which makes them more difficult to accelerate 10 in the latter two systems the nature of the stellar companion is not yet clearly identified those systems might be intermediate mass x ray binaries 11 due to their similar compactness parameters see section 1 1 1 12 especially in terms of self emission and magnetic properties 13 note that hypervelocity stars could also gain their large velocities from tidal disruption of tight binary stars by the galactic cen tral supermassive compact source sgra as one of the two stars is captured the other is ejected at high speed via the gravitational slingshot mechanism hills 1988 2 2 other x ray sources 43 figure 2 5 the pulsar igr j 1104 6103 as it speeds through the interstellar medium at over 1 000 km s 1 it is likely the aftermath of the core collapse explosion responsible for the supernova remnant in the upper left part of the picture a jet like structure is also visible credits pavan et al 2014 44 chapter 2 x ray sources figure 2 6 zoom in on the head of the guitar nebula where lies the runaway pulsar psr 2224 65 the change in shape of the wake from year to year is clearly visible and its orientation is compatible with the measured velocity direction the angular size of each picture is approximately 15 arcseconds and the objects is believed to be located at approximately 2 kpc credits hst the planarity of this accretion process makes the situation essentially axisymmetric and brings up the question of the longitudinal stability of the accretion wake the runaway pulsar psr 2224 65 cordes et al 1993 is associated to a prominent nebula nicknamed the guitar nebula whose evolution over years has been monitored the shock in the wake of the accretor has a cone shaped with a pinch or neck which moves along the wake measuring its dimensions and its time evolution is a precious asset to understand the instability at stake in this accreting system are the variations in the wake mere tracers of inhomogeneity in the interstellar medium or are they related to properties of the accretion mechanism 2 2 2 tidal disruption events tidal disruption events or tde correspond to the disruption of a star passing close enough from a su permassive bh to experience dramatic and irreversible tidal effects hills 1975 frank 1978 because the majority of supermassive bh are believed to lie dormant and starved of fuel those transient events could shed some light on those quiet objects rees 1988 in particular in galactic centers where the feeding mechanism remains unclear see section 2 2 3 massive stars which develop a bifurcated structure be tween a dense core and a tenuous envelope are more vulnerable to tde they preferentially provide fuel to accrete for the superemassive bh and could significantly contribute to the flaring activity of the latter depending on the amount of angular momentum of the inflow the flare will decay over years bonnerot et al 2015 2 2 3 sagittarius a sgra the compact object lying at the center of the milky way melia and falcke 2001 genzel et al 2010 b is known to be nowadays clavel et al 2013 much

invariant 14 we focused the discussion on stellar mass accretors nevertheless in terms of spectral range of emission we saw that the determining param eter was the compactness of the body and it turns out that most if not all galactic centers are believed to host smbh if some of them wallow in a well deserved deep rest like sgra others called active galactic nuclei agn are way more luminous and

empirically measurable data furthermore it has proven to be a won derful tool to illustrate emphasize and reinforce a physical argument after a short reminder on the physical laws at the bottom of our work we introduce the code we used mpi amrvac the numerical scheme we followed and a few notions of high performance computing for a reference describing the mathematical tools used in this chapter tensor calculus linear algebra etc see appel 2007 1 the coupling between scales is an intrinsic flaw and strength of continuum mechanics 47 48 chapter 3 numerical tools 3 1 conservation laws 3 1 1 context fluid mechanics is a non formal mesoscopic average of the kinetic theory and its inherited boltzmann equation diu et al 1997 it introduces a set of variables which tap their epistemological legitimacy in their physical profitability to interpret a wide range of phenomena with some features inspired by classical mechanics we use the mass density the velocity v and the total pressure p of a particle of fluid a subvolume of the system considered whose characteristic size l verifies 1 l is large enough to guarantee that any particle of fluid contains a large enough number of actual particles 2 to wash out the microscopic statistical noise 2 l is small enough to resolve macroscopic objects of interest typically the waves of wavelength which form and develop in the fluid to summarize fluid mechanics can prove to be a handy frame of thought provided we can define particles of fluid which verify n 1 3 l 3 1 with n the density of actual particles we can either consider the fluid variables v and p called the primitive variables as 1 a collection of values associated to all particles of fluid at a given moment t for example r t t would be the mass density at t of the particle of fluid located with the position vector r function of t it is the lagrangian point of view where we follow the particles of fluid 2 scalar and vector fields defined on an implicitly discrete mesh 3 for instance r t would be the mass density at t of the particle of fluid which happens to find itself within an infinitely small volume around the point located with r at t it is the eulerian point of view both approaches are physically equivalent but as far as the numerical implementation is concerned we will rely on an eulerian approach see section 3 3 so as to facilitate compact and coordinate free formulations we introduce the 5 components vector of conservative variables u defined by u r 3 r r 5 r t 7 u r t v e 3 2 where e is the total energy per unit volume given by e 1 2 v 2 u 3 3 with the first term on the r h s being the kinetic contribution and u the internal energy per unit volume finally we will refer to the specific counterparts of extensive variables as the intensive quantities ob tained by dividing by the mass of the system 2 i e in the meaning of the entities covered by kinetic theory 3 either due to the physical concept of fluid particle or to the numerical one of cell see section 3 3 1 3 1 conservation laws 49 3 1 2 the euler equations fluid mechanics is based on sets of conservation laws supported by thermodynamical considerations the simplest form of conservation laws the euler equations is obtained by neglecting external forces viscosity 4 and heating cooling t u f u 0 3 4 with the vector of fluxes f r 5 m 5 3 u 7 f u v v v p 1 e p v 3 5 where the divergence operator applied to a tensor does not relate to the one applied to a vector in a trivial way apart in cartesian coordinates see formularies beware in 3 5 contrary to the expression of u 3 2 the three dimensional vector v unfolds along its own dimension so as to form a tensor inm 5 3 rather than a 8 componetns vector in r 8 the dyadic product is defined by a b ai b j i j 1 3 2 3 6 with ai and b j the coordinates of the vectors only in the cartesian case the expression 3 4 is a differen tial formulation of conservation laws legitimate only in smooth configurations this assumption can be relaxed for the integral formulations which serve to derive the jump conditions in appendix a 1 3 1 3 closure conditions the equation of state in 3 5 f can not be properly considered as a function of 5 u unless we are given a relation between the pressure and the other variables this additional general requirement to solve the equations of hydrody namics is known as the closure condition considerations of statistical physics we will not remind here guarantee the existence of a canonical equation of state 6 or e o s s which contains all the thermo dynamical information diu et al 2007 is the internal energy per unit mass it can be shown that this e o s can be splitted into a caloric and an entropic one respectively p and s p all along this manuscript we will focus on the case of ideal gases this thermodynamical model cor responds to a gas diluted enough to neglect the covolume associated to each particle 7 and the energy of interaction between particles with respect to their kinetic energy however particles are considered ther malized with each other thanks to collisions between infinitely small particles such as a temperature can always be defined in this case the caloric 8 e o s is given by p 1 3 7 with the adiabatic index see diu et al 1997 2007 for a definition a constant determined by the num ber of degrees of freedom per particle and whose value lies between 1 infinite number of degrees of free dom and 5 3 only 3 translational degrees of freedom for an ideal gas the speed of sound in the flow is then given by c 2 s p 3 8 4 see landau and lifshitz 1987 for an elegant description of the physical requirements which naturally lead to the mathematical expression of the viscosity term 5 the system is said to be autonomous if f is function of u only it can be a function of time and space but through u only 6 with s the entropy per unit volume 7 see the van der waals e o s for a quantification and a physical interpretation of this notion 8 the entropic one comes into play in the conservation laws if the temperature is explicitly needed e g in a cooling function for an ideal gas it is given by s rm ln p where r is the ideal gas constant and m the mean molar mass of the gas 50 chapter 3 numerical tools for a more detailed reminder see toro 2009 and for a comprehensive course refer to diu et al 2007 from now on unless explicitely stated we work with ideal gases a plethora of fruitful physical submodels can be derived from the euler equations which have irrigated mindful studies in geophysics climatology pedlosky 1992 city planning etc 3 1 4 hyperbolic sets of partial differential equations we now provide some elements of solution for the uni dimensional euler equation 9 so as to highlight the fundamental mathematical properties of this system at the basis of its computational resolution since conservation laws are quasi linear they can always be rewritten after using the chain rule as t u a u x u 0 3 9 where the symbol is to be understood as a matrix product and a u is the jacobian matrix a r 3 m 3 3 u 7 a u f u 3 10 in the case of an ideal gas we have after having cautiously expressed the coefficients of f exclusively as combinations of full coefficients of u no of v left alone a u 0 1 012 3 v 2 3 v 1 1 2 2 v 3 c 2 s v 1 3 2 2 v 2 c 2 s 1 v 3 11 which can be diagonalized to yield the following eigenvalues i and eigenvectors ki 1 v cs 2 v 3 v cs 3 12 and k 1 1 v cs e p vcs k 2 1 v 1 2 v 2 k 3 1 v cs e p vcs 3 13 since the eigenvalues are all real and distinct the euler equations form a set of strictly hyperbolic partial differential equations this property remains true in three dimensions and for more general e o s if we write k the matrix formed with the eigenvectors ki as columns and ad the diagonalized form of a we can rewrite te euler equations as k t u ad k x u 0 3 14 if k is smooth enough with respect to its evolution with space and time we can write k i u i k u for i t x 3 15 and we are left 10 with a set of decoupled uni dimensional linear advection equations for the variable k u the use of the so called characteristics then provides an extraordinary way to transform those partial differential equations into ordinary differential equations 11 shu 1992 the eigenvectors 12 form a set of 9 u r 3 and f m 3 1 now 10 within a local region of space and time 11 if the solving of partial differential equations in general remains a tremendous challenge of contemporary mathematics the realm of ordinary differential equations has been extensively explored in the past couple of centuries 12 associated to discontinuous rarefaction and shock waves 3 2 numerical scheme 51 linearly independent vectors from which all solutions albeit local if a depends 13 on u can be derived the selection of a specific solution requires the prior of the initial condition u x t 0 u 0 x and will be investigated in section 3 2 2 where the riemann problem is addressed 3 2 numerical

odstrcil 1996 t th et al 1998 it is an explicitely flux conserving finite volume transport code which can now address hydrodynamical or magneto hydrodynamical problems in a classical a special or a fully relativistic framework with or without polytropic prescriptions source terms etc porth et al 2014 the recourse to a coordinate and dimensionality independent syntax 15 enables users and develop ers to freely design algorithms and configurations which apply to a broad range of situations it is an eulerian based code where physical quantities are defined at the center of each cell as averaged values over the whole cell see section 3 2 2 the source and user files are designed so as to make a change of coordinates straightforward natively it covers the usual orthogonal curvilinear coordinates mignone 2014 cartesian cylindrical and spherical they are uniform in the sense that cell centers are equally spaced along each dimension thanks to the implementation of adaptive mesh refinement amr made by van der holst and keppens 2007 different levels of spatial resolution 16 can be explored and treated with different numerical schemes customized data analysis can be carried on

based module naturally handles the mesh related information 17 to produce versatile and storage saving output files 3 2 2 algorithmic recipes the following sections are intended to give the reader a sensibility about the main algorithmic issues one can encounter in numerical simulations of fluid dynamics on a grid more detailed can be found in the related references leveque 1992 2002 toro 2009 dullemond 2009 finite methods starting from conservation laws such as 3 4 the spatial and temporal derivatives must be evaluated to advance the computation of an approximate solution at any time from an initial condition several ap proaches can be undertaken to handle the discretisation inherent to the computational tool among oth ers can be found 13 integral curves of the characteristic family can be used as non linear extensions of the characteristics straight lines associated to linear hyperbolic systems i e systems wherea does not depend on u this approach brings up the notion of riemann invariants as conserved quantities along the waves 14 for message passing interface adaptive mesh refinement versatile advection code sometimes referred simply as vac in this manuscript not to be confused with the initial version named alike complementary details about the structure of the code can be found in appendix a 5 15 thanks to the loop annotation syntax a k a lasy t th 1997 a perl preprocessor vacppl takes care of converting the t files from lasy to proper fortran f files using the user defined settings on dimensionality and coordinates but more generally about the mesh structure 16 adaptive time stepping ats has not been yet implemented in vac but can be found for instance in the ramses code see commer on et al 2014 for a case where ats proves very profitable once coupled to amr 17 including the informaton relative to amr http www ics uzh ch teyssier ramses ramses html 52 chapter 3 numerical tools 1 the finite difference method the most straightforward approach is to associate to a collection of nodes a collection of values each variable is a set of point values attached to a set of unstructured positions i e the mesh is not necessarily associated to a regular grid in this way the spatial deriva tive of a quantity u in one point xi is simply given by x u uk i 1 uki 1 xi 1 xi 1 3 16 where we used the super and subscripts accordingly to figure 3 1 there is no cell nor interface in this approach so this equality suffers no ambiguity it is the only way to have a fair accounting of the contribution of both sides the system can then be solved by evaluating the fluxes above with k n or n 1 which gives respectively the explicit or the implicit method the latter requires more computation 18 and couples all the points together which makes little sense for hyperbolic system where the information propagates at finite speeds however it sometimes has precious assets like stability and convergence but is not necessarily accurate the finite difference approach is easier to implement fast to compute but does not extend to complex geometries nor to amr 2 the finite volume method in this approach we solve the integrated form of the conservation laws separately in each cell of the grid for instance for the conservation of mass d dt ci ri t n dv 0 3 17 where we used the green ostrogradsky theorem also ri refers to all the points within the volume ci not to a hypothetical cell center is the total flux of mass through the cell edge there the discretization can be made on one hand by using an average value n i associated to the cell ni ci ri t n dv v 3 18 and on the other hand with a set of approximated fluxes at the left and right interfaces respectively i 1 2 and i 1 2 x n 1 i n i t i 1 2 i 1 2 0 3 19 notice that this method is conservative by construction 19 since i n 1 i i ni x t n 1 2 1 1 2 3 20 cell i x t n xi 1 2 xi 1 2 i 1 2 i 1 2 figure 3 1 sketch to define the different notations in the uni dimensional finite volume approach where the emphasis is put on edges and fluxes subscripts i refer to the position while superscripts n refer to the time iteration the timestep is written t 18 matrix inversion newton raphson root finding etc 19 at least up to the computation error level of 10 14 in double precision 3 2 numerical scheme 53 where 1 1 2 and n 1 2 are the fluxes at the edges of the grid considered in this implicitly mesh based approach all the secret of the numerical recipe will be contained in the way the fluxes at the interface are determined a method referred to as reconstruction the riemann problem the simplest non trivial initial value problem we can make up for uni dimensional conservation laws is t u f u 0 with u x t 0 u 0 x ul if x 0 ur if x 0 3 21 with ul and ur constant and different it is called the riemann problem a mathematical generalization of the physical sod s shock tube problem given the finite volume point of view we adopt we can already understand the paramount importance of this reduced problem which mimics the situation at each inter face on each side of the interface the function is constant indeed the solution of the general initial value problem on a grid may be seen as resulting from non linear superposition of solutions of local riemann problems godunov s methods are based on this principle at each interface a riemann problem will be solved such as over a timestep the propagating characteristic waves do not overlap differencing schemes accordingly to the finite difference approach one could want to use a central differencing scheme to re solve say for the sake of clarity the uni dimensional linear advection equation of a step function with a constant advection velocity v 0 t v x 0 x t 0 1 for x 30 0 for x 30 3 22 its differentiation in a naive cell centered approach suggests to replace the fluxes with i 1 2 i 1 2 2 x v n i 1 ni 1 xi 1 xi 1 3 23 in an explicit approach it means that n 1 i is given by for an equally spaced grid n 1 i ni t 2 x v ni 1 ni 1 3 24 the numerical result of such a gross approximation is illustrated in the upper panel of figure 3 2 where all the wriggles below x 60 have little to do with the mathematical solution the dotted line and much to do with the numerical scheme this numerical scheme yields clearly unstable solutions for this problem the main issue lies in the fact that to update the value of un i we make use of information from upstream 20 but also from downstream which does not make any physical sense the information can not go back up 21 anything which happens in the flow downstream xi does not belong to its domain of determinacy and can not influence its value at this instant in hyperbolic systems information propagates at finite speeds through characteristics we can use this causality property to design one sided derivatives in the direction from which information should be coming 22 it is the bottom line of the first order upwind scheme we present here 20 i e the region x xi resp x xi if v 0 resp if v 0 21 note that in this simple situation there is no other wave speed than v not even the sound speed 22 with possibly different directions for different information if there are different characteristic velocities typically for a system of several equations i e not for the canonical one dimensional linear advection one 54 chapter 3 numerical tools figure 3 2 upper panel a central differencing numerical solving of the uni dimensional linear advection equation of a step function which went wrong the dotted line stands for the analytical solution while the markers and solid line indicate the numerical answer lower panel the same numerical problem solved with an upwind differencing scheme from dullemond 2009 since v 0 we use the value on the left to define the fluxes at the interface in 3 19 n i 1 2 v ni 1 n i 1 2 v ni 3 25 which gives the convex combination of n i and n i 1 to get n 1 i n 1 i ni 1 v t x v t x ni 1 3 26 where the weights can also be obtained by following the characteristics and interpolating the value of n 1 i between the grid values 23 n i 1 and n i this simple workaround leads to the results displayed in the bottom panel of figure 3 2 the scheme proves way more stable and is monotonicity preserving see the comprehensive course by dinshaw balsara on techniques for numerical solving of partial differential equations but the numerical diffusion of this first order scheme smeared out the step function 23 for instance graphically on the middle panel of figure 3 3 where we see that t x 0 67 v at t n 1 the cell xi has been overran up to 67 of its own space by the flow which was in xi 1 at t n http www 3 nd edu dbalsara numerical pde course 3 2 numerical scheme 55 in 3 26 appears a necessary condition which turns out to apply to any explicit differencing method the courant friedrichs lewy condition a k a cfl condition since the value in xi at t n 1 depends only on the value in neighbouring cell at t n we must make sure that the characteristics from xi 1 2 if v 0 does not go beyond xi 1 2 within one timestep more generally if we write max the maximum absolute propagation speed for information we need 24 max t x 1 3 27 empirically a courant number max t x smaller than 0 5 is usually enough to guarantee the stability and the accuracy of the numerical scheme this scheme is said of first order in x and t since a taylor expansion of n 1 i and n i 1 in 3 19 yields a slightly different expression than the original one 3 22 we wanted to solve t v x t 2 t t v x 2 xx o t 2 o x 2 3 28 where t and x take place at the first power hence the first order this expression highlights the un avoidable artificial diffusivity introduced by the spatial discretization in the second term of the r h s it can be lowered by rising the resolution or using higher order schemes for instance with slope limiters or larger stencils 25 to compute the derivatives for time it means using a predictor to compute the fluxes at mid timestep to reach a second order precision in time a final remark higher order schemes are more accurate only if there is no strong discontinuities in them according to the two last terms on the r h s of 3 28 when shocks take place specific shock capturing schemes must be used figure 3 3 finite volume interpretation of an upwind scheme applied to a linear advection equation with v 0 the flow is moving to the right the bottom graph represents the piecewise constant function at t n and the upper one yields if averaged over each cell the piecewise function at t n 1 in between are represented the characteristics which monitor the advance of the steps from leveque 2002 24 implicit methods can to appearances beat this limit but from experience they start to lack accuracy when the timestep be comes much larger than x max besides their strong stability makes it difficult to point out suspicious behaviour by eye 25 a mini grid of points which contribute to the quantities we wish to evaluate 56 chapter 3 numerical tools our algorithmic setup in most of the simulations presented in this manuscript we used a second order lax friedrichs method with a hancock predictor thanks to the use of slope limiters 26 the scheme is made total variation dimin ishing which means that no new local extrema are created it is monotonicity preserving and the values of local minima respectively maxima increase respectively decrease the courant number is typically set to 50 although quite diffusive the tvd lf method is robust and not prone to give birth to spurious oscillations 3

into blocks of equal sizes we write ni the number of cells of the grid in the direction 27 i and ni the number of cells of a block in the same direction a first obvious constraint is that ni must divide ni one of this two dimensional cartesian grid has been represented on figure 3 4 the cells on the border of each block 28 must be communicated to the cpu 29 responsible for the computation in the neighbouring blocks possibly itself to compute spatial derivatives once the run starts the code can refine 30 some areas thanks to amr based on user defined criteria or standard error estimates and divide up the existing n n figure 3 4 a representation of a two dimensional cartesian grid of size n with blocks of size n on the left the blocks which are adjacent to a border of the grid thick

miseries of hpc 57 blocks down to a specified maximum number of refinement without loss of generality we will now assume that the cells are squared which means that the ni and ni are the same whatever the direction i the two dimensionality of the meshes we consider from now on can also easily be relaxed and does not alter qualitatively the following remarks on the right side of figure 3 4 are displayed the boundary cells those whose value must be communi cated to neighbouring blocks to compute spatial derivatives the user can specify the thickness of this layer with the parameter dixb in vac here called one can convince himself that the square configura tion is ideal to minimize the fraction of cells at the interface with other blocks at a fixed total number of cells 31 in this section 3 3 we consider static grids which are not destined to be refined the number of blocks is set initially by the user defined parameters and does not change during the simulation the use of amr obviously changes those conclusion but the monitoring of the communication we describe below is not as critical since the number of blocks per cpu and the total number of cpus are large enough to allow slight unbalanced working load without dramatic consequences 3 3 2 parallelization the philosophy of the code is to strongly compartmentalize the computation on each block so as they can autonomously be monitored by different cpu possibly on different nodes without excessive communica tion time furthermore one must keep in mind that the number of cpus selected ncpu can not be larger than the initial 32 number of blocks given in two dimensional meshes by k n n 2 we will see that it is the main limitation for strong scalability of the code in the debugging stage of development we write k the number of blocks per cpu to avoid underloading cpu which seems to slow them down we set k to 4 to guarantee that each cpu has a sufficient number of cells to work on to assure a good load balancing we also want each cpu to work on the same number of blocks so ncpu must divide the total number of blocks k besides to guarantee that the squared cells assumption remains true at the level of blocks per cpu 34 we require k to be a squared quantity 1 4 9 16 to maximize the possibilities and make the discussion easier to follow we work with powers of 2 from now on the following results can easily be extended to any sizes the communication between cpus is monitored within vac thanks to the subroutines of the openmpi library 3 3 3 computation speed and profiling we define v the computation speed per cpu as v nop nit t ncpu 3 29 where nop is the number of realized operations per iteration 35 nit is the total number of time iterations required to complete the simulation 36 and t is the total elapsed real time in the user frame vac offers the possibility to evaluate v nit at each time step from our experience it can vary a lot for a given numerical setup 37 from 104 on local university clusters up to a few 106 on national ones on top of this it can also 31 see the classical optimization problem where it is asked to show that the sphere without any privileged direction like this cartesian mesh is the minimal surface of a given volume or that the height of a can must be equal to its diameter to minimize the surface of the associated cylinder at a fixed volume 32 in case of amr where the user usually starts with a limited number of blocks the simulation can be performed on a short number of iterations 33 enough to get a large number of blocks and then rerun using the output data files as initial state 34 see the grey shaded group of blocks on figure 3 8 for example 35 performed at the scale of arithmetic logic units a subscale within the cpu 36 difficult to evaluate a priori if a laps of physical time rather than a number of steps has been specified since the time step can change during the simulation 37 and a given number of blocks and cells per cpu

produced as the job is run it details the work flow of each cpu the time spent in each subroutine and the communication steps vary by a factor up to 20 from a timestep to another during a given simulation memory leaks compilation options and static dynamic library linking can among others be responsible for it it can also come from the code which must be monitored by using a profiler such as vampir in association with vampirtrace its runtime library 38 the use of a profiler is mandatory once an anomalously slow computing velocity has been spotted to look for reasons within the code an error estimate to refine and coarsen the grid where needed the correction of excessively low density or pressure 39 a data file being written a data file being converted into a visualization file etc we give a few elements of scalability theory to the reader on the basis of 3 29 it is an essential feature for high performance computing code which certifies its capacity to run efficiently on a large number of cpus two kinds of scalability can be defined 1 strong scalability a code is said to be strongly scalable if v does not decrease excessively as the number of cpus rise all other things being kept equal in particular the number of grid cells playing a role in nop must remain the same it is absolutely necessary for a code to be scalable up to an intermediate number of cpus e g 16 to 32 to be able to debug the code upstream and work out numerical caveats before running it on major facilities and on many cpus indeed the debugging step always on a small number of cpus requires in priority t small to appreciate the reactions of the code to modifications which drives the user into using a low resolution to decrease t while debugging the user then wants to rise ncpu up to 16 or 32 cpus for instance 2 weak scalability in practice the simulation space can not be subdivided into an infinitely large number of blocks 40 each being monitored by exactly one cpu as explained in 3 3 2 to avoid the 38 in parallel computing caveats in the algorithms can not be traced by simple print statements due to the intrinsically non linear work flow the very step of writing requires additional precautions when it deals with parallel computing 39 first there is the physical fallacy to use the hydrodynamics equation based on the continuous medium assumption in an environment where the mean distance between particles overcomes the characteristic size or wavelength of the phenomena we are interested in second having large mach numbers above a few 10 enlarges the relative numerical error we make on computing the pressure for instance since we get it from the difference between the total and the kinetic energies which become very similar large contrasts in density within the simulation space can also lead to artificially high velocities because of errors at the level of the solver which work with conservative variables which lead to excessively small timesteps due to the cfl condition those points are the main reasons to set a floor density and pressure 40 for codes compatible with multithreading and gpu computing it is theoretically possible to have more processing units than blocks but still the quick rise in communication time would make the computation speed drop https www vampir eu news 3 3 splendors miseries of hpc 59 figure 3 6 the same simulation has been run on the arago cluster of the face for different ncpu horizon tal axis and total number of cells vertical axis the colormap represents on the left the total duration of the simulation in the middle the average computation speed v nit per unit time step and on the right the fraction of time spent communicating the black cells are configurations where the code has not been run caveats which appear when a cpu is underused or when communication becomes preponderant one can monitor the evolution of v as the total number of grid cells rises in the same proportions as ncpu then the work load per cpu remains approximately similar a code is said to be weakly scalable if the total elapsed time t remains fairly constant as the resolution and the number of cpus rise figure 3 6 can be used to illustrate those notions as one moves along an horizontal line from left to right the total number of cells remain the same as the number of cpus rises we evaluate the strong scalability of the code the weak scalability corresponds to the bottom left to upper right diagonals along which the number of cpus and cells is multiplied by 2 each time finally notice that the core operations to perform when a job is run on a cluster nop can be separated into two main categories 1 the algorithmic ones depending on the numerical scheme and its order for instance 2 the communication steps to transfer the values found in the boundary cells to the neighboring blocks the shrinking of the latter is the topic of the last section of this chapter and the former can be empirically minimized but obeys to mathematical constrains which can not always be bypassed such as the cfl condi tion if communication between nodes is seamlessly fast on modern servers with matchless infiniband 41 technology on the best clusters it is of critical importance on local clusters it is the user responsibility to solve an optimization problem when ni and ncpu are chosen for a given ni so as to minimize the commu nication time a larger number of cpus all other things being equal does not necessarily result in a lower amount of total computing time t it is also the only way to isolate the errors intern to the code from issues due to an incompatibility of the code with the facilities which requires the interplay of the admin istrators of the server to formalize this approach we will now present a recurrent issue met by vac on the arago cluster of the face 42 namely the use of multithreading it is a commonly used feature on modern architectures a single cpu can run concurrently several processes 43 the scheduler of arago which is 41 a computer networking communications standard which can transfer up to 100 gbit s 1 42 on nodes with 32 cpus each 43 in some ways it is an internally parallel computing 60 chapter 3 numerical tools called each time a pbs 44 script is submitted distributes the jobs between the dozen of nodes each of them being assigned 32 virtual cpus in reality there are only 16 of them each of them being splitted in two by multithreading with vac the call to 32 cpus on 1 node leads to a slowing down so violent v is divided by approximately 20 from 16 to 32 cpus that the rise of ncpu does not compensate it a similar numerical vac setup will be 10 times more time demanding on 32 cpus than on 16 cpus on the arago cluster with multithreading 3 3 4 communication due to hardware constrains cpu in local university clusters are organized within nodes and sockets which typically contain a few dozens of cpus a rule of thumb is that communication within a cpu is always much faster than communication between different cpus within a node which is itself much faster than communication between different nodes furthermore unfitted hardware tricks such as multithreading 45 can lead to significant decreases of the computation speed per cpu by a factor of 20 if not bypassed see previous section national clusters such as the cines suffer much less flaws and are configured so as to make the most of the facilities 46 to minimize the contact surface between blocks monitored by different cpus vac uses a morton algorithm to distribute the blocks between cpus the load balance step if we write nbc the total number of cells within a border red and black dots in figure 3 8 whose thickness is defined by and nbc 6 the cells within a border adjacent to a block monitored by another cpu red dots figure 3 7 total duration t of a given benchmark simulation as a function of the number of cpus used ncpu the grey shaded area below the black curve stands for the optimal strong scaling where t 1 ncpu the red and green points are the observed results in another timescale than the one repre sented but with a similar shape with and without multithreaded cpus respectively taken from a slice of figure 3 6 at a total number of cells of 219 524288 the red dotted and green dashed curves are proposed fits to explain those computational behaviour see equation 3 32 the number of cells the duration scale and the number of timesteps are fiducial ones and do not alter those results provided they are not excessively small below 10 seconds 44 for portbale bash script 45 which is at the basis of high performance computing methods not yet compatible with vac 46 identical numerical configurations typically run 20 to 400 times faster on the cines than on local university clusters on a similar number of cpus the origin of this discrepancy can not be found in a different fractions of statically and dynamically linked libraries to the executable since the compilation itself is of the order of 10 times faster on the cines 3 3 splendors miseries of hpc 61 n n figure 3 8 same as figure 3 4 except with twice as large resolution in each dimension but we zoom in on a set of blocks all monitored by the same cpu the grey shaded area made of 4 blocks in red have been represented the boundary cells whose values must be communicated to other cpus than the one they belong to ncpu 16 and k 4 in figure 3 8 we have nbc k 2 1 d 2 n 2 2 n 2 d 4 n n 2 2 n 2 3 d 3 30 where the 1 d and 3 d cases are given for information and where we neglected the edges of the grid and their ghost cells 47 and we have for nbc 6 in 2 d nbc 6 4 p kn ncpu 3 31 which gives by difference the number nbc of boundary cells destined to be communicated within a cpu black dots in figure 3 8 we can now affirm that the number of operations to be performed by iteration nop scales as the sum of the total number of cells plus the number of cells to be communicated within and between cpus in a similar fashion as the approach suggested by the gustafson s law nop n 2 p 1 4 ncpu n k ncpu p 2 4 ncpu k n kncpu np ncpu 3 32 where we reinjected the expressions n n kncpu and k n n 2 to make use of the preexisting de pendences and limit the number of variables once we set the resolution i e n typically 2 and the number of blocks per cpu usually 4 we are left with a function of ncpu only the weights p 1 and p 2 each represent the speed of the operation and the relative fraction it occupies within the code 48 we can 47 which is acceptable as long as k 1 48 due to the philosophy of the code see section 3 3 2 the latter is minimized most of the operating time per cell is spent integrating not communicating 62 chapter 3 numerical tools estimate for the sake of illustration p 1 the communication between cpus to be of the order of 30 while p 2 the communication within a cpu is much lower say 1 we can now provide an estimate of the total duration of a simulation t using 3 29 with a fiducial speed v 106 cells per second per cpu n 256 and the previously given figures the communication time within a cpu can be safely neglected since it concerns a comparable number of cells and is an order of magnitude faster than communication between cpus to account for the enhanced communication time between cpus which do not belong to the same node we modulate p 1 with a step function 49 which rises its value beyond the threshold of 32 cpus the maximum number available per node on arago to account for the mulithreading issue we can modulate v similarly with a threshold at 16 cpus we see on figure 3 7 that the experimental benchmarks are in agreement with the model with or without multi threading respectively in red and green the small glimpse at 32 cpus can be smeared out by modern communication devices between nodes such as infiniband the maximum number of cpus 64 here re veals that the values of the number of blocks per cpu and the total number of blocks in the simulation space can be stringent constrains on low resolution debugging meshes this section emphasizes the caution which must be taken when one considers the computational fea sibility of a numerical simulation empirical investigations to assess the compatibility of the code with the material available must be performed and inherent unbalanced work load within the code must be tracked down with a profiler given the complexity of the codes for hydrodynamics those tests can not be realized on simple benchmarks but must be repeated on each new numerical configuration or at least on configurations as close as possible from the one destined to yield scientific results 3 3 5 adaptive time stepping the interest of using different time steps for different blocks i e doing adaptive time stepping ats is clear when the blocks have very different time steps it typically occurs when amr is used with a spatial dynamics of two to the power of the number of refinement levels the lower absolute resolution regions are likely to be associated to large time steps and thus do not require as many numerical iterations as the higher absolute resolution regions vac does not include yet the possibility to use ats but before spend ing time implementing it one must carefully wonder about the computing time it spares indeed if the blocks with the smallest cell size i e highest resolution contain most of the cells which is likely because it takes more of them to mesh a given simulation space the speed up factor is not that high the large cells where we save computing iterations are too few to make ats advantageous in this case figure 3 9 shows an estimate of the speed up factor for different total number of cells in the radial columns and angular rows direction of an axisymmetric 2 5 d grid such as the one used in the second part of this manuscript the size of the block named here subgrid is either 4 8 or 16 which changes the speed up factor the smaller the block the more efficiently we can spot a halve of the time step on the other hand blocks with smaller sizes bring more communication time see section 3 3 4 the shaded region locates the esti mate with the upper and lower limit of those areas being computed respectively if only gravity or the cfl condition set the time step because ats requires additional algorithms to deal with the communication of information between blocks at different physical time 50 those speed up factors are overestimations given the significant code development effort ats represents and the limited interest it represents in our case with expected speed up factors being at best of a few we did not implement it in vac 49 typically 12 1 tanh ncpu ncpu critical 0 5 50 in the same way as in amr when it is necessary to communicate the values in the ghost cells of two blocks with different resolutions 3 3 splendors miseries of hpc 63 figure 3 9 estimates of the speed up factor depending on the size of the simulation space and the size of the blocks the figures between parenthesis in the upper left corner of each panel indicate the radial and angular resolution in the upper right panel can be found the ratio of the inner boundary size by the outer boundary size 64 chapter 3 numerical tools part ii planar bhl accretion onto a compact object 65 introduction before addressing the wider topic of wind accretion in x ray binaries in the third part of this manuscript we first investigate the accretion process itself the model of accretion by a moving point mass initially designed by bondi hoyle lyttleton henceforth abbreviated with bhl offers a quintessential representa tion of the physics at stake when a massive astrophysical body rushes through a homogeneous medium 51 the beaming of the flow as it sees the accretor approaching can produce a shock whose properties can not easily be derived from purely analytical considerations multi dimensional partial differential equa tions from fluid mechanics leave little room to explicit solutions however the thorough study of the underlying equations revealed fundamental characteristics associated to those flows which can be used as guidelines to separate the numerical artifacts from the physically relevant features the numerical setup we designed aims at overcoming the main computational obstacle which resides in the scale contrast between the size of the compact accretor and the extension of its gravitational sphere of influence although the compact body deflects the streamlines at a large scale the flow remains free to evolve down to the accretor which lies deep inside the shock for realistic velocities we will see that this discrepancy reaches up to 6 orders of magnitude characterizing the accretion flow requires to uniformly probe each of those scales the first attempts to numerically model bhl flows date back to the eighties and revealed the limitations of the analytical models rich structures appeared and were quickly ques tioned to disentangle the influence of the constraining setup e g cylindrical cells and two dimensional meshes from the physics behind the scenes some features inspired more sophisticated models and the technological progresses of hpc made possible more demanding numerical simulations in a first chapter we remind the reader about the sketch drawn by bondi hoyle lyttleton to follow ballistic test mass from infinity down to the accretion line in the wake of the accretor the arguments to derive a first estimate of the mass accretion rate will be of use in the last part of this manuscript to plunge this model into a roche potential unlike this qualitative approach the spherical case of bondi accretion offers an occasion to highlight the notion of sonic point the leading role played by the sonic surface in setting the mass accretion rate will also appear in the second chapter of this part where we numerically address the full hydrodynamical bhl flow in this second chapter our primary goal will be to design a ro bust axisymmetric numerical setup taking the most of the hpc methods implemented in the mpi amrvac code presented in section 3 2 1 the obtained results are finally discussed and interpreted in order to both evaluate the reliability of the numerical model and to characterize the flow behavior in conditions reminiscent of wind accretion in x ray binaries 51 equivalently we will consider a static accretor with a planar supersonic incoming flow 67 68 chapter 4 accretion of zero angular momentum

4 1 ballistic trajectories 4 1 1 model let us consider a point mass of mass m with a relative speed v with respect to the ambient medium at infinity considered as homogeneous we set this point mass at the origin of its co moving frame this setup is axisymmetric which enables us to work with only 2 coordinates we place ourselves in the plane containing the axis passing through the accretor and of direction v we locate the points in this frame by their distance to the origin r and the angle positive between v and the position vector r as sketched in figure 4 1 finally we set v the magnitude of v as the normalisation quantity for velocities and hl 2 gm v 2 as the normalisation quantity for lengths where g is the gravitational constant the physical meaning of the latter will appear later on in its simplest form hoyle and lyttleton 1939 bondi and hoyle 1944 the bhl 1 incoming flow is supersonic at infinity i e its mach number at infinity m v cs is above 1 where cs is the sound speed of the flow at infinity directly linked to its temperature for an ideal gas as a consequence we can 1 for bondi hoyle and lyttleton 69 70 chapter 4 accretion onto a point mass characterize the permanent streamlines by the trajectories of test masses 2 in the gravitational potential of the accretor 4 1 2 equations of motion figure 4 1 sketch illustrating the ballistic bhl flow with the variables and the orientation we consider a fiducial stream line for a given impact parame ter is plotted in dashed the light grey area is the simulation space for the sake of visibil ity its inner boundary is highly oversized compared to its outer one the equation of motion can be straightforwardly solved and gives the dimensionless position and velocity r 2 sin 2 2 sin 4 1 vr 1 1 r r 2 4 2 v r 4 3 with the dimensionless impact parameter of the streamline passing through the point r r sin 2 1 1 2 1 cos r sin 2 4 4 streamlines with different impact parameters have been plotted using the polar equation 4 1 in figure 4 2 since the mach number of the flow does not play any role in those ballistic equations this model of the bhl flow is often referred as the zero temperature bhl flow however the equation 4 1 shows that streamlines all converge towards a line in the wake of the accretor called the accretion line we will discuss the physical relevance of the ballistic approximation in its vicinity in 4 1 5 4 1 3 mass and energy density in this steady state model the mass density can be deduced from the frozen flux of matter using the steady state conservation of mass it implies that v is a divergence free vector field which leads to 2 r sin 2 r sin 4 5 where we normalized with the homogeneous density of the flow at in finity if one considers an adiabatic flow no heating nor cooling on the dynamical timescale the steady state conservation of energy see section 3 1 is given by e p v v 4 6 with p the pressure the gravitational point mass potential and e the total energy per unit volume i e the sum of the kinetic and internal parts since the steady state conservation of mass is given by v 0 we can write the right hand term of 4 6 as a divergence e p v 0 4 7 2 which does not apply to an excessively massive inflow possibly in a common envelope phase where the self gravity of the inflow should be taken into account 4 1 ballistic trajectories 71 where we recognize the bernoulli quantity b between parenthesis following the expression of the mass density obtained above from v 0 we can say that b is given by b b 2 r sin 2 r sin 4 8 where we the normalized b with its value at infinity whose dimensionless expression b is 3 for an ideal gas b 1 2 1 1 m 2 4 9 where is the adiabatic index 4 the equation above makes use of the first joule law 5 of the mayer relation 6 and of the law of ideal gases combined together they yield the total energy per unit volume of an ideal gas u e ek p 1 4 10 where ek is the kinetic energy per unit volume and u is the internal energy per unit volume the expression 4 7 will be of key importance and can not be replaced with a polytropic prescription in the numerical implementation of the problem we consider 4 1 4 mass accretion rate in their seminal paper hoyle lyttleton derived a critical impact parameter based on the following ar guments since the streamlines converge along the accretion line we can expect dissipative effects to essentially cancel out the normal component of the velocity field if we write the specific mechanical energy of a test mass on the accretion line deprived of its v component we have 1 2 v 2 r 1 2 r 1 2 1 1 2 4 11 where we used 4 1 and 4 2 we retrieve that for large impact parameters compared to the soon to be revealed length scale hl the mechanical energy is left unchanged from its initial value at infinity this relation indicates that test masses with an impact parameter below the critical value of hl will find them selves bound to the accretor i e a negative mechanical energy they are then likely to be accreted hl is called the accretion radius though formally it is a critical impact parameter the corresponding critical ar rival point on the stagnation line which separates the bound and free test masses is called the stagnation point 7 the green dot in figure 4 2 and corresponds to the streamline with an impact parameter hl the corresponding physical mass accretion rate m hl can be deduced by considering the cylinder of radius hl and of axis the direction given by the relative speed at infinity m hl 2 hl v 4 12 for realistic values of a 1 4 m runaway neutron stars rushing through the interstellar medium with a rel ative speed of 200 km s 1 see e g figure 2 5 it gives m hl 10 18 m 1 4 m 2 10 24 g cm 3 v 200 km s 1 3 m yr 1 4 13 3 we normalized the energies per unit volume with v 2 4 as defined in section 3 1 3 see horedt 2000 for a mindful distinction with the widespread polytropic index 5 which states that the internal energy of an ideal gas is function of its temperature only with the heat capacity at constant volume as a slope 6 which relates the heat capacity at constant volume as a function of the adiabatic index for an ideal gas 7 in spite of the fact that the velocity at this point is not zero but just enough to not be able to counterbalance gravity the test mass will start to flow away before receding 72 chapter 4 accretion onto a point mass which is well below any detectable threshold in luminosity given the equation 1 15 despite its ineffi ciency this mass transfer can result in non negligible drags on timescales of the order of the mass dou bling timescale edgar 2004 always much longer than the timescales we will consider in the present manuscript figure 4 2 set of ballistic trajectories from 4 1 in red for a mach number at infinity of 1 1 mildly supersonic flow and a dimensionless impact parameter at infinity of 0 1 0 5 1 1 5 and 2 from left to right in units of hl the central black dot locates the accretor at the origin while the green one gives the stagnation point the dot ted black line splits the trajectories between their su personic part in red and their subsonic part repre sented with a low opacity since they doubtfully corre spond to any real trajectory the ballistic approximation having broke up given the dramatic assumption on the bal listic behaviour of the flow until the normal component of the velocity is suddenly dissi pated on the accretion line equation 4 12 pro vides an order of magnitude of the mass accre tion rate the hydrodynamical effects will al ter this value even for high mach numbers at tempts to include them are described in the two next sections 4 2 and 5 1 4 1 5 limits of the ballistic model due to the axisymmetry the expression of the streamlines 4 1 indicates a serious convergence of the streamlines in the wake of the accretor if not a crossing the velocity field v can no longer remain divergence free and the incompress ible flow assumption 8 breaks up it is actually likely that pressure effects must be accounted for before the accretion line as an example we plotted in figure 4 2 a few streamlines and pin pointed the points beyond which they become subsonic by this we mean that if one considers an isentropic flow 9 the laplace relation for an ideal gas gives the expression of the dimension less sound speed in any point c 2 s 1 m 2 1 4 14 then one can compute the mach number at any point and detect the ballistic front shock black dotted line in figure 4 2 this surface is well fitted by a cone i e constant aspect ratio of the width with respect to the distance to the point mass along the accretion line which will motivate the accretion cone model presented in 5 1 2 8 indeed since the ballistic assumption implies that the flow is incompressible but not the fluid which means that the la grangian derivative is zero along each streamline since we are interested in the permanent behaviour it also means that the stream lines are orthogonal to the isodensity surfaces the use of the conservation of mass also implies that v is divergence free by contra position when streamlines cross each other in a steady state framework it means that the lagrangian derivative can no longer be considered as zero 9 in case of discontinuity along the field line such as a shock the entropy of the fluid will actually rise see appendix a 1 up stream the isentropic assumption is essentially validated since the motion is adiabatic no heating nor cooling term valid if the thermal timescale is much larger than the dynamical one and mechanically reversible e g if no shock 4 2 hydrodynamical intermezzo the bondi spherical model 73 4 2 hydrodynamical intermezzo the bondi spherical model 4 2 1 context before introducing hydrodynamical elements in the bhl model described in the previous section we de scribe another model the spherical bondi accretion where an analytical study can be carried on thanks to the unidimensionality of the problem figure 4 3 represents the isotropic situation of a point mass of mass m at rest with respect to an ambient uniform gas at infinity the latter has a non zero but subsonic velocity at infinity v and a non zero temperature associated to a sound speed cs at infinity 10 we can no longer derive ballistic trajectories since the flow at infinity is subsonic pressure terms can not be neglected we undertake a fully hydrodynamical analysis from scratch with physical quantities for the moment first the steady state conservation of mass in this isotropic configuration yields if we write m the constant and homogeneous mass accretion rate on the central point mass m 4 r 2 r v r 4 15 where v stands for the radial component of the velocity on the other hand we have the steady state conservation of the linear momentum v dv dr gm r 2 1 dp dr 4 16 for the sake of analytical solvability we now bypass the equation of energy using a polytropic relation be tween the pressure and the mass density it if fully legitimate provided the gas is both ideal and undergoing an isentropic transformation p cst 4 17 where lies between 1 for an isothermal gas i e a gas which would instantly radiate away any augmenta tion of internal energy or would instantly be heated to compensate a loss of internal energy and 5 3 for an adiabatic gas i e a gas which would not exchange heat with the outside meaning it would not radiate figure 4 3 sketch of the bondi spherical accretion model the black dashed line represents a streamline the purple dotted line represents the sonic surface of an inflowing gas subsonic at infinity 10 the omission of the symbol will be justified a few lines below by an isothermal assumption 74 chapter 4 accretion onto a point mass away the increase in internal energy due to the work done by the pressure force then we have dp dr dp d c 2 s d dr 4 18 where the identification to the square of the sound speed is valid because of the isentropic assumption 4 2 2 the isothermal velocity profile differentiating 4 15 we get d 2 dr r dv v 4 19 injecting this expression in 4 18 and then in 4 16 yields r v dv dr 2 v 2 c 2 s r 1 1 gm 2 cs r 2 r 4 20 in this section only we will discuss the isothermal case i e 1 so as to analytically derive an implicit expression of the velocity profile in the expression above the sound speed cs no longer depends on the position the reader is nonetheless invited to refer to frank et al 2002 11 where the polytropic case in general are treated most comments we will make about the structure of the solutions remain essentially unchanged for 1 from now on we can motivate the choice of normalization quantities for the velocity and the length the sound speed 12 and a radius we already call sonic rs gm 2 c 2 s using them we get the dimension less equation of motion dv dr 2 v r 2 r 1 v 2 1 4 21 which can luckily enough be integrated to give an implicit expression of the velocity profile v 2 2 ln v ln r 2 2 r k 4 22 where k stands for the integration constant different values of k set different families of solutions in figure 4 4 for k 1 5 we obtain the double valued functions on the left and right side of the x point indexed 6 and 5 while for k 1 5 we get the solutions on the lower and upper sides of the x point indexed 3 and 4 a first statement can be made about the asymptotic behaviour of the velocity profile starting from the lower left panel and going counter clockwise v e 2 r for v 1 and r 1 v 1 r 2 for v 1 and r 1 v p ln r for v 1 and r 1 v p 1 r for v 1 and r 1 4 23 we also notice a decisive feature of those solutions which will run into again in the different context of radiatively driven winds later on the existence of a sonic point the aforementioned x point by sonic point resp surface we mean a point resp surface through which passes a fluid particle which becomes at this precise point supersonic 13 indeed if one gets a closer look at 4 21 it is clear that along the r 1 11 and to lamers and cassinelli 1999 where the emphasis is on the outflowing solutions though 12 which makes all the dimensionless velocities be mach numbers 13 the reverse a point where the fluid particle becomes subsonic is not a sonic point and displays very different properties as we will see in section 5 3 and appendix a 1 4 2 hydrodynamical intermezzo the bondi spherical model 75 figure 4 4 mach number squared as a function of the ratio of the distance to the stellar center by the sonic radius each curve corresponds to a mathematical solution 4 22 with a different constant k the 4 different families of solutions are indexed along with the 2 critical solutions thick solid lines from frank et al 2002 line the solutions must verify dv dr 0 while along the v 1 the solutions must verify dr dv 0 the only exceptions to these results are the critical solutions i e those who verifies v r 1 1 in this case the derivative are no longer singular but given by de l h pital s rule dv dr r 1 1 4 24 the only point which admits two different slopes at the same point is the sonic point r 1 and v 1 an inflowing solution subsonic at infinity for the negative slope and an outflowing one 14 subsonic in the vicinity of the surface of the object for the positive slope the latter indexed 2 in figure 4 4 corresponds to the parker wind model parker 1958 while the former indexed 1 is the one we are interested in the bondi accretion the other families of solutions will not be discussed here but are detailed in lamers and cassinelli 1999 and frank et al 2002 4 2 3 the polytropic sonic point we now relax the isothermal assumption but not the polytropic one intregrating the equation of motion yields the physical bernoulli invariant b 1 2 v 2 dp c 2 s 1 gm r cst 4 25 where c 2 s is no longer uniform however we can get precious insights if we write the equality between the bernoulli invariant at infinity and at the sonic point 15 1 2 v 2 c 2 s 1 1 2 c 2 s c 2 s 1 gm rs 4 26 14 indeed notice that the equation 4 21 remains unchanged by the transformation v v 15 from here the isothermal case 1 requires a specific treatment not covered by the equations 4 26 and 4 27 76 chapter 4 accretion onto a point mass figure 4 5 the sonic radius in units of hl as a funtion of the adiabatic index for a mach number at infinity of 0 5 1 2 and 4 from bottom to top the isothermal flow 1 the monoatomic adiabatic flow 5 3 and the diatomic adiabatic flow 7 5 have been represented with vertical lines since we still have even without the isothermal assumption a sonic point in rs gm 2 c 2 s given the critical point in 4 20 still valid we obtain the sonic radius rs 5 3 4 1 2 gm v 2 1 2 1 1 m 2 4 27 where we recognize the accretion radius hl at the numerator though in a very different geometry from the one it has been defined in initially in the next chapter this quantity will be referred to as r 0 to differentiate it from the distance to the sonic surface in the non spherical case this expression also appears behind the equation 2 11 b of theuns and david 1992 and locates the uniquely determined position where a stationary isotropic subsonic inflowing gas becomes supersonic 4 2 4 mass accretion rate the only solution which goes from infinity down to the accretor without shock is a transonic one sub sonic at infinity and which becomes supersonic as the flow gets accelerated towards the accretor more interestingly the only solution able to do so reaches the sound speed at the sonic radius rs we are now in conditions to determine the physical mass accretion rate of bondi spherical accretion m b indeed since m b is uniform it can be evaluated anywhere the expression 4 27 suggests to do so at the sonic point m b 4 r 2 s cs s 4 28 using laplace relation and the definition of the sound speed we can get rid of the mass density at the sonic point and are left with the sound speed at the sonic point and quantities at infinity but thanks to 4 26 we can express the sound speed at the sonic point as a function of the sound speed at infinity thus we have m b gm 2 c 3 s 1 5 3 m 2 2 1 5 3 2 1 4 29 4 2 hydrodynamical intermezzo the bondi spherical model 77 for a monoatomic flow 16 with a negligible velocity at infinity towards the accretor compared to its sound speed at infinity we get the following estimate for the mass accretion rate of a putative intermediate mass black hole accreting the gas from a cold interstellar medium at rest at infinity with respect to it m b 10 7 m 500 m 2 10 24 g cm 3 cs 1 km s 1 3 m yr 1 4 30 which corresponds to the luminosity levels we observe in x rays for ultra luminous x ray sources webb et al 2014 for a stellar mass object in a warmer environment though typically an isolated neutron star such a luminosity would be impossible to detect beyond a few kiloparsecs 16 5 3 78 chapter 4 accretion onto a point mass chapter 5 numerical simulations of planar accretion onto a compact body contents 5 1

possible in the case of bondi spherical accretion it is in large part due to the unidimensionality of the problem once we get interested into an axisymmetric situation like the bhl flow things get trickier we must sacrifice the hydrodynamics to be left with a set of ordinary differential equations otherwise we are doomed to face the much less cooperative realm of partial differential equations in this section we introduce two different ways to navigate between the two bondi s pragmatic though approximated approach and the accretion cone model we also prepare the ground for the treatment of the shock by suggesting the reader to refer to appendix a 1 for the jump conditions at planar and oblique shocks 79 80 chapter 5 planar flow accreted onto a compact body 5 1 1 the bondi empirical formula in an attempt to incorporate thermodynamical considerations in the frame of bhl flow bondi 1952 sug gested an intermediate formula 1 which has then been modified by shima et al 1985 on the basis of numerical results to verify m bh m hl 1 1 m 2 3 2 5 1 where m hl is given by 4 12 and m is the mach number of the flow at infinity at high m this mass accretion rate does match the one derived from ballistic considerations but we already notice that at low mach numbers for any adiabatic index it can not converge towards the expression 4 29 obtained for spherical mass accretion rates since it does not account for the dependency in admittedly it provides us with a continuous mass accretion rate which empirically extends the bhl flow to the subsonic regime but does not yet provide a uniform interpolation formula joining the spherical bondi and the supersonic bhl flows we will introduce such an interpolation formula matching both the low and high mach number limits in section 5 4 2 5 1 2 the accretion cone in addition the matching of m bh with m hl for high mach numbers guarantees the self consistency of the approach but not necessarily its physical relevance indeed m hl has been estimated based on ballistic arguments which strictly speaking do not apply whatever the mach number of the flow at infinity the accreted particles of fluid always cross a region of space where the ballistic approximation breaks up so as to refine this model we follow horedt 2000 and edgar 2004 to introduce the accretion cone model a k a accretion column model the accretion line is replaced with an infinitely thin accretion cone 2 by balancing the mass and linear momentum fluxes crossing a surface of a infinitely short section of this cone we will be able to estimate a lower limit for the mass accretion rate associated to the bhl flow let us consider the configuration depicted on figure 5 1 and adimension the lengths with hl the densities with the velocities with v and the other quantities with straigthforward products of those quantities 3 the flow remains ballistic outside of the accretion cone of half opening angle the position along the cone axis is located with r increasing in the direction of v its radius at this position with s and we assume s r r such that within the cone the quantities depend only on r and the velocity has no transverse component we can evaluate the expressions obtained in 4 1 2 as to relate the impact parameter to the longitudinal position r r 2 5 2 then we can write the conservation of mass within the red section of infinitesimal length dr d m lat d m 1 d m 2 0 5 3 where the d m correspond to the mass fluxes 4 through respectively the lateral surface 2 sdr the back surface s 2 r and the front surface s 2 r dr the fluxes are given by d m lat vtot 2 sdr 2 d dr d m 1 d m 2 v s 2 r v s 2 r dr dr d v s 2 dr 5 4 1 we prefer not to use the term interpolation formula found in the literature since it does not behave as the bondi spherical mass accretion rate at low mach number as we shall see in a minute 2 see figure 4 2 for an empiric justification of this shape 3 without any additional factor to make sure the geometrical ones do not vanish for instance the pressure is simply normalized with v 2 4 where the surface elements are oriented outwards 5 1 hydrodynamical approaches of bhl flows 81 where vtot is the projection of the velocity on the normal axis to the cone surface in r while v is the velocity in the cone purely along the cone main axis for d m lat we first used v 0 to trace back the streamlines up to the corresponding section at infinity and then 5 2 for the last equality in the spirit of this one dimensional model we now introduce the linear mass density along the cone dm dr it enables us to rephrase 5 3 using dm s 2 dr s 2 d v dr 5 5 we now undertake the same balance for linear momentum with the corresponding linear momentum fluxes d mvr lat vr vtot 2 sdr 2 d dr d mv 1 d mv 2 v 2 s 2 r v 2 s 2 r dr dr d v 2 s 2 dr d mv p 1 d mv p 2 p s 2 r p s 2 r dr dr d ps 2 dr 5 6 where d mvr lat is the infinitesimal flux of longitudinal linear momentum the one which is not dissipated at the shock and does enter the cone and d p are the infinitesimal fluxes due to the work done by the pressure forces notice that in the first flux 5 we used the assumption that the transverse component of the velocity field is instantaneously dissipated then it does not contribute to the balance within the cone once we add the dimensionless gravitational source term l h s below the total balance yields 1 2 r 2 d v 2 dr d p s 2 dr 5 7 v r s d dr 2 figure 5 1 model of the accretion cone the black dot stands for the accretor and the front arrow for the relative speed along the axis the shock blueish surface is represented by a cone of opening angle 2 two streamlines separated by an infinitely small impact parameter d have been represented they intersect the shock at a distance to the accretor r and within a range dr at this distance the width of the cone is given by the first order infinitesimal s i e s r and the corresponding surface is shown in red 5 where we used vr 1 82 chapter 5 planar flow accreted onto a compact body from there one can either argument in favour of the negligibility of the pressure term edgar 2004 or make do with it and make assumptions on the thermodynamics wolfson 1977 horedt 2000 in the former case we are left with a set of two non linear coupled ordinary equations for two variables the reduced linear mass and velocity along the cone the first one 5 5 can be straightforwardly integrated introducing the stagnation point rx v r rx 5 8 which enables us to get rid of in 5 7 which is now given by v dv dr v 1 v r rx 1 2 r 2 5 9 a numerical integration with an approximate spatial condition has been represented on figure 5 2 where the black dot stands for the position of the stagnation point in the bedrock model of the bondi hoyle lyttleton purely ballistic flow it can be shown that monotonic solutions which match v 1 as r can be obtained only for rx above 0 5 this value would imply a mass accretion rate twice smaller than m hl providing a lower limit we will put on test later on with numerical simulations section 5 4 2 figure 5 2 illustrative velocity profile in the wake of the accretor along the accretion tail in the accretion cone model the curve was obtained by numerically integrating 5 9 with rx 2 and the biased condition v 0 2 0 0768 to bypass the stagnation point which is mathematically singular the black dot indicates the stagnation point through which passes the real solution with rx 1 within a few accretion radii the velocity retrieves its value at infinity at a few 10 accuracy level for a supersonic inflow with a mach number larger than 2 since the temperature quickly recovers its value at infinity along the accretion line see text it means that the flow becomes supersonic again in the cone above a few accretion radii finally the temperature along the accretion line can be estimated with the square of the sound speed which relates the pressure p to the mass density according to 3 8 the latter is simply obtained from the mass per unit length along the tail by considering the transverse surface s 2 since the ballistic inflow is essentially pressureless compared to the shocked flow we can estimate that the pressure in the wake origins from the dissipation of the linear momentum transverse to the shock balancing the fluxes we have p 2 sdr d mv lat v vtot 2 sdr 5 10 where v p 1 r according to 5 2 once injected in 4 3 the previous remarks yield an estimate of the evolution of the sound speed along the wake c 2 s r sp r 5 11 5 2 numerical implementation 83 in practice we will see that the accretion tail is not conic and that s evolves slower than r beyond 0 5 hl the tail is concave as a consequence cs does not change much from its value at infinity beyond 0 5 hl section 5 3 3 5 2 numerical implementation 5 2 1 finite size of the accretor the mass accretion rate 4 29 we derived in the previous chapter was determined using the existence of a critical point through which the gas could flow the sonic point passing through it was a necessary condition to get a unique transonic solution however if the radius r of the accretor is larger than the sonic radius rs then the mass accretion rate is altered the influence of the finite spatial extension of the accretor considered until now as a point mass is discussed in detail in ruffert 1994 b for the bondi spherical accretion with a zero velocity at infinity the units of length and mass accretion rates which arise are respectively gm c 2 s gm 2 c 3 s 5 12 and when m 0 the dimensionless mass accretion rate m b becomes if we still write r the dimension less radius of the accretor shapiro and teukolsky 1983 m b 4 2 1 r 4 1 1 2 1 1 r 3 5 1 1 2 1 5 13 for large accretors the mass accretion rate behaves as a geometric one 6 apart from a factor of order unity we retrieve the formula 4 29 for accretors which lie within the sonic sphere i e on the left of the black dots on figure 5 3 which never happens for 5 3 because in this case the sonic radius is null as a consequence whatever small the inner boundary is it alters the numerically measured mass accretion rates if 5 3 such as simulations of a monoatomic gas being accreted require additional precautions concerning the treatment of the inner boundary on figure 5 3 it can be seen that all other things being equal a gas undergoing accretion in an isothermal way i e cooling fast enough to maintain a constant temperature in spite of the work done by pressure forces yields a larger mass accretion rate than an adiabatic flow which does not exchange heat with the exterior and sees its temperature rising as it collapses because of the work done by pressure forces in the case of a bhl flow it will be shown in section 5 4 1 that this dependence of accretion on the size of the inner boundary of the simulation space still holds indeed the sonic surface of a bhl flow shares with its spherical sibling tied links which will make the cancelling of the sonic radius for 5 3 decisive 5 2 2 dynamics spatial dynamics let us start by presenting the most numerically demanding prerequisite of this physical model the scale dynamics by scale dynamics we mean the amplitude of the discrepancy between the smallest and the largest scales in the system the shape of the shock formed by the incoming wind has not been foreseen analytically actually its very stability even in the axisymmetric configuration remains an intensively debated open question see foglizzo et al 2005 table 1 as a consequence we can not force the shock as a condition exterior to the simulation space and focus on the inner parts only we can however predict 6 i e the one obtained by computing the amount of mass intercepted by a moving disk of radius r per unit time 84 chapter 5 planar flow accreted onto a compact body figure 5 3 mass accretion rate as a function of the size of the accretor for 3 different adiabatic indexes the black dots locate the sonic point which is expelled to zero for 5 3 the dotted blue line indicates the geometric limit at large radii for 5 3 and depends little on the characteristic lateral size of the shock which corresponds to the scale at which the flow is significantly deflected by the point mass given the arguments described in 4 1 4 we can affirm that this scale is given by the accretion radius hl an important conclusion we can draw comes from the analysis of the mach profile which has been implicitly sketched in 5 1 2 we could see on figure 5 2 that the velocity at infinity was recovered in the accretion cone model beyond a few accretion radii along the accretion line since the sound speed also quickly reaches its value at infinity we can safely affirm that at 8 hl in the wake the flow will have become fully supersonic again see also blondin and pope 2009 figure 3 it sets the size of the outer boundary of the simulation space the second scale to grasp is either the sonic surface if 5 3 or the accretor itself for 5 3 since the sonic radius cancels out we set ourselves in the second case since we work with monoatomic gases if the size of the accretor can be of the order of the accretion radius for an accreting star it is much smaller when we deal with a compact object for realistic wind relative speed at infinity v the discrepancy between the 2 scales depends only on v and the compactness parameter of the accretor hl r 2 c v 2 5 14 where r is the size of the accretor and is of the order of a few 10 for a neutron star and is 1 for a black hole with the schwarzschild radius rschw as the characteristic size at a fixed compactness pa rameter value this discrepancy does not depend on the mass of the accretor since the accretion and the schwarzschild radii both scale with it in the same way to quantify how computationally demanding a numerical simulation will be we plotted log hl rschw as a function of v respectively on the right with n 0 and left side of figure 5 4 we see that as the relative speed at infinity rises the discrepancy be tween scales lowers but for the wind relative velocities expected in x ray binaries zones a and b on the figure hl 105 rschw for a neutron star with 15 it implies an outer boundary for the simulation space 240 000 times larger than the inner boundary as a guideline the few families of compact objects in astrophysical systems where wind accretion could occur are located a black hole high mass x ray binaries in particular lmc x 1 where an onfp companion star seems to provide a particularly fast wind orosz et al 2008 it could also be the case of lone runners black 5 2 numerical implementation 85 holes which have been accelerated in a close encounter with other black holes sperhake et al 2011 lora clavijo and guzman 2013 b runaway neutron stars and sgxb the first family might be illustrated by the radio pulsar psr b 2224 65 and its iconic guitar nebula cordes et al 1993 albeit the pulsar wind might play an additional role in the formation of the shock compared to the simple bondi hoyle sketch a runaway neutron star more suitable to apply the bondi hoyle model might be psr j 0357 3205 where the tail is too long to be accounted for by shocked pulsar wind models de luca et al 2013 for sgxb it is believed that we detect the wind of an early spectral type super giant ob star accreted by a slowly spinning neutron star orbiting on a close in

member is probably eso 243 49 hlx 1 farrell et al 2009 it has been suggested among others that a wind accretion within a binary system might be responsible for its x ray luminosity miller et al 2014 an imbh could also be present in the orion nebula cluster and undergo wind accretion from a massive stellar companion ubr et al 2012 d e neutron star in low mass x ray binaries cataclysmic variables

accretion disc f super massive black holes accreting ambient gas of which the velocity at infinity deduced from the kinetic energy left if it had fully escaped the super massive black hole gravitational potential is estimated here from the sum of the proper motion of sgra and of the characteristic stellar disper sion speed reid et al 2003 it could be higher if one considers the gas launched from surrounding massive stars see ruffert and melia 1994 for simulations of accretion onto sgra along those lines except for collisions of galaxies the bulk motion of a super massive black hole compared to the am bient gas is likely to be negligible figure 5 4 contour map of the accretion radius hl of the bhl flow as a function of the velocity at infinity and of the mass of the accreting body confronted to an estimate of the computational cost on the right the latter is represented by the ratio of the inner boundary radius rin by the schwarzschild radius of the compact object rschw with n being given by hl rin 10 n such as for n 0 the right axis indicates the physical ratio hl rschw see el mellah and casse 2015 for a description of the astrophysical objects associated to the different zones 86 chapter 5 planar flow accreted onto a compact body time dynamics translated into constrains on the timescale things get even worse indeed the timestep t is set by the minimum value between 1 the timestep tcfl set by the cfl condition see section 3 2 2 tcfl k min r v 5 15 with k the courant parameter 7 and v absolute velocity of the flow plus the sound speed 8 since the cells are approximately squared and the velocities in the radial and orthoradial directions are similar it is representative in this illustrative argumentation to consider r only 2 and the timestep tg set by the gravitational acceleration tg min r 1 2 min r 2 5 16 with as used in this second part of the manuscript hl v v 2 hl the scales of length velocity and acceleration due to the structure of the mesh we designed see 5 2 3 the cell center radial position is for each cell and with cell aspect ratios of 1 of the order of the ratio of the radial by the angular step r for a resolution good enough min r rin eventually the timestep of the whole simulation space is given by t min 1 2 min r v 2 r 3 in 5 17 along the accretion line upstream the shock we can use the equations of 4 1 2 with 0 to get the velocity for r 1 i e before the shock such as the cfl timestep at a distance r upstream of the accretor is given by tcfl r 2 r r 1 r 5 18 but this relation is true down to r 1 then the velocity drops because of the shock and for the sake of simplicity we will not consider the reacceleration as large enough to bring tcfl below tg indeed given its expression tg r p 2 r 3 2 the gravitational timestep sets the simulation timestep t at low radii figure 5 5 summarizes the evolu tion of this representative timestep along the front line with the radius at large scales the bulk motion of the supersonic flow dominates over the influence of the gravitational force while below a certain threshold fiducially set to the shock here it is the gravitational force which sets the timestep as a consequence we can now estimate the discrepancy between the small and large scales timesteps tmax tmin tg r 1 tg r rin 1 r 3 2 in 5 19 with rin the size of the inner boundary in untis of accretion radii with rin 10 4 the size we have to reach for x ray binaries according to figure 5 4 it means that the motion at large scale requires a timestep 6 or ders of magnitude larger than the timestep needed to follow the flow in the vicinity of the inner boundary to observe the numerically relaxed state which takes place within a few crossing times it means that we have to plan a few millions of numerical iterations 7 usually set to 0 5 in our simulations 8 in the hd case where the only characteristic wave is the acoustic one 5 2 numerical implementation 87 figure 5 5 timestep as a function of the radius along the front line upstream the accretor from the outer boundary down to the shock r 1 the timestep is set by the cfl condition once the velocity drops downstream the shock the gravitational timestep takes on and is the constraining one at low radii state of the art until now two approaches have been used to bypass this computational limitation on one hand a physically motivated one which consists in focusing on putative compact objects rushing at almost rela tivistic speeds through the interstellar medium if asymmetric supernova explosions are not expected to account for velocities above 1000 km s 1 tauris and takens 1998 some models of encounters between two spinning black holes allow kick velocities to reach 15 000 km s 1 sperhake et al 2011 in this case the ratio between the accretion radius and the size of the compact object becomes as small as 400 making the simulation way less computational demanding physically it can be interpreted by saying that the bulk motion of the flow is related to a mach number so high 9 that the pressure forces can not come into play until the last minute when the flow has already arrived very close from the object the upper front of the shock is then close enough from the object to encompass the two within the same simulation space at an affordable cost fully relativistic hd simulations of accretion onto a superkicked black hole rotating or not have been run by lora clavijo and guzman 2013 and lora clavijo et al 2015 who studied the stability of the flow and characterized its structure on the other hand truncating the inner boundary by making it deliberately larger than the physical size of the compact object has been another option in spite of the potential caveats reminded in 5 2 1 this option implicitly assumes that the flow which enters the volume around the accretor associated to the oversize inner boundary is trapped and that the enforced boundary condition at the inner boundary is representative enough of the physical answer to prevent the large scale structure from being impacted by it simulations of planar bhl accretion along those lines have been carried on by blondin and pope 2009 blondin and raymer 2012 and blondin 2013 in two and three dimensional simulations see figure 5 6 with inner boundary sizes down to almost 10 3 hl or 10 2 hl in 3 d which corresponds to several hundreds times the actual size of the compact object for wind speeds measured in sgxb this discrepancy can alter the stability of the flow and bias the mass accretion rates numerically observed 9 in the comoving frame of the compact object the flow is rushing towards the accretor but its temperature being invariant by the galilean change of frame valid for non relativistic relative velocities and temperatures the mach number is extremely high 88 chapter 5 planar flow accreted onto a compact body figure 5 6 full three dimensional simulation of a planar flow onto an accretor whose physical size is a few thousands times smaller than the size of the inner boundary represented here as a solid sphere the yellow to red scale on it represents the local mass accretion rate while the main color scale is the mach number of the flow from blondin and raymer 2012 5 2 3 mesh the geometry the planar bhl flow we address in this second part of the manuscript is a naturally centered problem the gravitational field produced by the point mass is isotropic although the flow at infinity is planar preliminary investigations of the flip flop instability in 2014 see figure 1 6 led us to give the priority to a numerical scheme which conserves angular momentum up to machine precision the best way to do so was to use on one hand the axisymmetry to work in a two dimensional simulation space and on the other hand a spherical mesh to reproduce the full three dimensional dynamics of the flow 10 this setup is referred to as 2 5 d spherical where the fractional dimension is a way to say that it reproduces the full three dimensional behaviour where an axisymmetry would have been enforced a two dimensional slice is then sufficient to follow the motion the spherical mesh even once radially stretched as presented below is associated to orthogonal coordinates a prerequisite to some of the numerical schemes we rely on in particular concerning the computation of the fluxes at the interfaces see section 3 2 2 the grid r r 1 r 2 ri 1 ri ri 1 rn 1 rn ri 1 2 ri 1 2 figure 5 7 illustration of the logarithmic grid with the cell centers indexed with integers the cells indexed 1 2 n 1 and n are the ghost cells outside of the simulation grid where the inner and outer boundary conditions are set 10 in particular the dilution with the distance to the accretor which plays a role in the explicit form of the divergence operator in spherical coordinates see 5 2 4 5 2 numerical implementation 89 figure 5 8 two dimen sional polar self similar grid with a constant cell aspect ratio at all radii how computationally demanding the time dynamics of the problem is has been estimated in 5 2 2 the stake is now to make the number of cells as small as possible while still being able to resolve the characteristic features of the flow a first naive approach could be to set the radial step such as to be able to properly resolve the inner boundary indeed we need cells at the inner border whose radial extension is small enough with respect to the size of this inner boundary due to the presence of two additional ghost cells on the outside border of the simulation space at the inner edge we need them at least to fit within the hole drawn by the inner boundary furthermore to avoid spurious numerical oscillations due to excessively strong gradients and or boundary conditions applied in environments too different in terms of relative conditions we need cells at least an order of magnitude shorter than the radial extension of the inner boundary due to the typically 5 orders of magnitude discrepancy between the inner and outer boundary it means a prohibitively large number of radial cells 11 another approach would be to make use of the amr option of vac see figure 1 6 however on top of the discontinuous steps of resolution it introduces the issue of the aspect ra tio 12 would not be solved indeed the aspect ratio along a radius changes in the same proportions as the distance to the center leading to strongly de formed cells which could turn to be harmful for the accuracy of the numeri cal schemes 13 the best way to homogeneously and continuously resolved all scales is to keep a constant aspect ratio for all the cells within the simulation space r r constant 5 20 with the latitudinal coordinate in the spherical frame 14 thus we have a different radial step at each radius given by r r r 5 21 we call such a grid logarithmic due to the constant ratio r r to minimize the impact on the code we set the radial center of each cell mid way between the two edges see figure 5 7 the stretching is also performed outside of the simulation box in the ghost cells those indexed 1 2 n 1 and n on figure 5 7 the position of the cell centers and edges can then be analytically derived once the angular resolution and the number of radial cells are fixed the ratio of sizes between the outer and the inner boundary can be set manually provided we tolerate slight departures 15 of from its optimal value of 1 beyond the ho mogeneity that this implementation brings to the grid by having a constant aspect ratio for any radius it also saves a lot of computation by enabling the user to have a similar relative resolution r r all over the grid without having to oversample the large scale far away from the center the number of cells re mains computationally affordable and the only challenge left is the number of timesteps it takes to reach a numerically relaxed flow in the nominal regime we studied the bhl flow with 64 latitudinal cells and 128 176 or 224 radial ones depending on the size of the inner boundary relatively to the outer one we fix high angular reso lution simulations with an aspect ratio twice as low where also performed as sanity checks to confirm the vanishing influence of the mesh on the observed results 11 of the order of a million 12 ratio of the sizes of the cell along the radial and the angular directions 13 a numerical scheme such as tvd lf is better used with similar interface sizes 14 we also extended it to 3 d in cylindrical and in spherical coordinates in 3 d spherical is used instead of to compute the aspect ratio thanks to the help of chun xia at ku leuven it was also made compatible with amr 15 below a few percent https www researchgate net profile chun xia 2 90 chapter 5 planar flow accreted onto a compact body 5 2 4 equations with a null initial east west longitudinal velocity v and the axisymmetry condition 16 writing the time evolution of v proves that it must stay to zero during all the simulations which it numerically does the entering flow is deprived of any net angular momentum and stays so by numerical construction hence forth we will no longer consider nor this direction nor this component of the velocity field in the rest of this chapter we unfold in spherical coordinates the euler equations introduced in 3 1 2 to get with the axisymmet ric condition t 1 r 2 r r 2 vr 1 r

the same as those introduced in 4 1 2 the pressure term is computed with the flux at the interface on the other hand the source term corresponding to the newtonian gravitational field of a point mass is computed at the cell center 17 the geometrical terms i e those in the divergence which do not write as a derivative are also computed at the cell center and added afterwards all those operations are performed following the shock capturing twosteps tvd lf method with a koren slope limiter 18 to guarantee robustness and accuracy see section 3 2 2 many numerical simulations until now have reported on results based on the polytropic assumption or an isothermal one to relate the pressure to the density if this workaround in analytical studies is an almost compulsory renouncement to go forwards in the computation it is not as mandatory when it comes to numerical simulations furthermore a major flaw in numerical simulations is to identify the polytropic index dlnp dln to the adiabatic index determined by the microstructure of the gas for an ideal gas the two are the same if and only if the evolution is isentropic 19 as pointed out by horedt 2000 which is way more constraining than the adiabatic assumption recall that the entropy not being a conserved quantity it can be exchanged through heating and cooling hereby quenched by the adiabatic assumption but it can also be produced when the gas undergoes a mechanically irreversible transforma tion e g a shock see appendix a 1 1 as we will see in section 5 3 solving the energy equation albeit with an adiabatic prescription enables us to naturally fulfil the shock jump condition and the associated 16 mathematically the enforcement of the axisymmetry corresponds to the invariance of all quantities with a change of i e 0 17 to be understood as the point where medians across each pair of interfaces cross rather than a weighted barycenter the two do not always correspond mignone 2014 18 while the superbee slope limiter would have been too unstable albeit even less diffusive the more diffusive minmod slope limiter has been used during the 5 first percent of the simulation in physical time to perform the initial strong relaxation 19 as clear from its expression reminded in the footnote 8 of chapter 3 5 2 numerical implementation 91 production of entropy accounting for the departure from adiabaticity would require either a full radia tive transfer equation solver or strong assumptions about the predominant cooling heating terms we chose a more neutral approach which is likely to require refinement as soon as the internal energy density variations due to heat exchange are no longer negligible compared to the ones due to the work done by pressure forces from now on since we work with a monoatomic gas it restrains the comparison of our results to prediction relying on 5 3 besides our 5 3 simulations may still depart from theoreti cal descriptions since we homogeneously describe the flow via an energy equation while writing p precludes any conclusive conclusion on the effects of the shock to be drawn 5 2 5 boundary conditions the partial differential equations in the previous section are associated with usual polar symmetric and antisymmetric conditions in 0 and using the frame specified on figure 4 1 for the outer radial boundary conditions far ahead the shock where the flow is supersonic we prescribe the ballistic solu tion for vr and v and the permanent regime solutions deduced for and the bernoulli quantity b from the mass and energy conservation equations equations 4 2 4 3 4 5 and 4 8 it assures that the gravitational ballistic deflection of the initially planar flow from infinity to the outer boundary is taken into account for the downstream outer boundary condition i e where the flow gets out of the simula tion space as specified in section 5 2 2 we work with a supersonic flow such as it avoids any spurious reflection of pressure waves continuously outflowing conditions then satisfy the requirements concerning the inner boundary conditions much caution must be taken straightforward absorbing conditions e g floor density and continuous velocities provided they leave the simulation space do alter the stability of the flow without any guarantee of fitting the continuity of the radial fluxes one has to not prevent the stationary solution of 5 22 to 5 25 to be achieved for example by ensuring the continuity of vr r 2 at the inner boundary so as to do so we computed the density in the inner ghost cells with a first order taylor young expansion and deduced the corresponding radial velocities from the continuity of the radial mass flux vr r 2 for the total specific energy e one has to write the gravitational source term as a pure derivative using the steady state mass conservation equation v v 5 26 to explicit the flux e p vr r 2 the same prescription as above is applied to this flux to derive the value of the pressure in the ghost cells the value of v is much less critical and is also set via a simple first order expansion such inner boundary conditions entitle the flow to reach a permanent regime as the ones described further note that those absorbing inner boundary conditions on top of the gravitational field make the situation very different from a planar flow deflected by a solid sphere the archetype we usually rely on to figure out high reynolds flows 5 2 6 input parameters physical parameters the input parameters of those simulations can be separated into 1 those which can be used as normalization quantities a k a scale parameters setting a velocity at infinity and a mass of the accretor for example sets the velocity and the length scales respectively v and hl 2 gm v 2 2 the dimensionless ones which set the shape of the flow a k a shape parameters in a similar role as the one played by the reynolds number for a viscous flow here it is the mach number at infinity m which is tuned by changing the temperature of the flow at infinity it is the only real degree 92 chapter 5 planar flow accreted onto a compact body of freedom of those numerical simulations 20 since the outputs can be scaled afterwhile to fit any normalization numerical parameters in numerical computation the unprecision due to the noise 21 is infinitely smaller than the systematics introduced by the additional layer of numerical modeling e g the choice of the solver the size of the inner boundary or the spatial and temporal resolution the best way to evaluate the latter is to design a priori sets of acceptable numerical configurations and empirically validate their neutrality by running the same physical configuration on each of them the similarity of the results obtained with different numerical configurations corroborates a posteriori their physical reliability in this spirit we ran those simulations with sizes of the inner boundary closer and closer from the physical size of the

case of a neutron star the magnetosphere will anyway comes into play probably even before while for a black hole non newtonian corrections must be made in this close in environment a new numerical setup either mhd lee et al 2014 with heating cooling terms to describe the radiation from the neutron star surface or general relativity to properly describe the black hole vicinity 23 lora clavijo et al 2015 must be concatenated to the present one finally the code was also tested with better resolution and different numerical schemes without any significant impact on the results presented in the rest of this chapter 5 3 the bhl shock in this section we describe the structure of the flow at the scale of the accretion radius 24 for super sonic flows at infinity a bow shock develops detached from the inner boundary 25 its stability is first discussed follows a physical consistency check up where we rely on the analytical results on adiabatic shocks reminded in the appendix a 1 to validate the robustness of the simulation finally we describe the transverse structure of the shock along the accretion wake and compare it to theoretical predictions the consistency of those results reinforced in the next section 5 4 enables us to affirm that the observed flow in those numerical simulations does result from the gravitational beaming of the flow without spurious influence of the inner boundary 5 3 1 opening angle as reminded in the appendix a 1 as we go from the planar shock at the front to further downstream along the shock surface the shock becomes more and more oblique figure a 22 emphasizes that for a given mach number at infinity there is a maximum obliqueness 26 beyond which the shock vanishes the down 20 note that the adiabatic index is set to 5 3 the value corresponding to a monoatomic gas 21 that is to say by physical phenomena considered as contaminating and polluting since not properly covered by the model nor repeatable enough to be easily monitored and corrected for 22 keeping in mind that each additional decade deeper in space costs an additional factor of 40 in cpu computational time since it is a problem which deals with the number of time iterations and not with the grid resolution it is not possible to shorten significantly the duration of the simulation by increasing the number of cpus see section 3 3 23 in this case the use of the eddington finkelstein coordinates alleviates the coordinate singularity at the event horizon which can then be fully included within the simulation space then the numerical caveats at the inner boundary described in section 5 2 5 spontaneously vanish 24 the radius of the white circle in the upper left panel on figure 5 9 25 on the contrary in two dimensional simulations on a polar grid assuming a cylindrical vertical extension the shock is attached see figure 1 6 26 obliqueness to be understood here as synonym for departure from planarity so with the notations of appendix a 1 5 3

flow accreted onto a compact body figure 5 10 measuring protocol to evaluate the opening angle on a fiducial relaxed configuration m 16 the outermost opaque stripe is the estimated envelope and the innermost one is its parallel passing through the accretor we read the opening angle with the latter one and the overlaid protractor stream and upstream variables are equal the corresponding theoretical minimum angles have been plot ted in red in figure 5 11 for the supersonic mach numbers we considered we measured the opening angle on each of the four relaxed supersonic simulations with m 2 fol lowing the protocol illustrated in figure 5 10 we drew the straight line tangent to the shock at the outer edge of the simulation space in the wake and measured its inclination relative to the direction of the flow at infinity since we do not have access to the whole tail and have to truncate it it only provides an upper limit on this inclination which overestimates the actual opening angle in figure 5 11 have been represented in black the measured angles for the different mach numbers the associated uncertainties represented with error bars come from the reading of the angle on the overlaid protractor but are like always with numerical simulations widely dominated by systematics the opening angles we measure decrease with increasing mach numbers as intuitively expected the first systematic shift one can think about is the fact that the theoretical opening angle is not neces sarily reached within the simulation box which explains that the measured one is always larger due to the concave shape of the shock however one must also notice that the oblique shock theory we remind in the appendix a 1 assumes a homogeneous planar inflow free of any exterior influence while we work on a gravitationally beamed configuration when they reach the shock most streamlines do so with a velocity vector which is no longer aligned with the velocity at infinity we took as a reference 27 in some way we can say that they are more normal than they would have been without the gravitational field it makes the meaning of the opening angle we measured different from the introduced for oblique shocks from a planar flow in a 1 2 5 3 2 jump conditions to study the jump conditions related to the subsequently formed bow shock we focus on the front shock locally planar the extension of the results below to the whole shock might however be of prime im portance for incoming follow ups of the inhomogeneous entropy downstream the shock due to different obliquenesses of the shock as one goes from the front to the tail foglizzo and tagger 2000 rather than describing the jump conditions for all variables like in the appendix section a 1 devoted 27 although for impact parameter above a critical non trivial value they start to tend to hit the shock without having being signif icantly deflected 5 3 the bhl shock 95 figure 5 11 the black triangles represent the observed minimum opening angles of the relaxed shock within the simulation space as a function of the mach number of the flow at infinity in red is the theo retical minimum opening angle below which there is no longer any deflection of the flow i e 0 in a 39 to it we undertake a precise study of the thermal jump condition in particular the shock is highly non isothermal and the corresponding measured jumps in temperature are shown in blue square markers in figure 5 12 one can understand the evolution of those discontinuities with the mach number at infinity by figuring out the corresponding rankine hugoniot jump condition at the shock front a 37 which is given by with subscripts 1 and 2 corresponding respectively to upstream and downstream quantities t 2 t 1 1 2 1 m 21 1 5 27 to relate m 1 the mach number just before the shock to m we use the fact that the density immediately before the front shock does not depart much from its value at infinity indeed with r sin 0 in 4 5 we retrieve for low since the evolution is isentropic before the shock 28 we can conclude that the pressure 29 and then the temperature itself did not change by much the sound speed at infinity is then similar to its value before the front shock for the velocity it can straightforwardly be deduced from 4 2 and gives if we write rsh the position of the shock front m 1 1 hl rsh m 5 28 with a shock front ranging between hl and a third of hl we expect a temperature jump lying within the gray area in figure 5 12 with the upper line corresponding to rsh hl 3 this figure shows that the numerical shock remains more dissipative than the real one due to the addition of numerical viscosity higher resolutions and higher order schemes can help to lower this discrepancy also we notice a suspi cious beaming along the polar axis visible in figure 5 9 at high mach number which might lead to under estimated values for rsh eventually we notice that as intended the mach 1 surface corresponding to the flow going from being supersonic to being subsonic 30 always stops before the outer edge for any m 2 28 due to an adiabatic energy equation and a ballistic motion without discontinuity 29 via the lagrange law for ideal gases or equivalently by the formula for the entropy of an ideal gas in 8 of chapter 3 30 the white dashed line in figure 5 9 which is not the sonic surface since it corresponds to a surface of decreasing mach number following the flow 96 chapter 5 planar flow accreted onto a compact body however we can not help noticing an interesting feature of oblique shocks since the tangential compo nent of the velocity field does not change as the flow crosses the shock and because the requirement for making the velocity subsonic downstream applies only to the normal component the total mach number does not necessarily goes below 1 as the flow crosses what is still a shock further away along the tail 31 we could even witness the vanishing of the shock when downstream and upstream conditions become the same figure 5 12 ratio of the upstream to the downstream temperature as a function of the mach number at infinity the blue points correspond to the numerically observed ratios with a fiducial 10 spreading while the gray area is where lies the theoretically expected ones 5 3 3 transverse profiles the transverse profiles along the tail have also been the object of theoretical predictions in bisnovatyi kogan et al 1979 the regime with the largest adiabatic index displays bow shocks with a cone shape cavity in figure 5 13 have been displayed in red the transverse temperature profiles and in blue the transverse density profiles to give an idea of the hull of those profiles along the tail we sampled the profiles along the accretion line from 0 5 to 6 hl resp upper and lower curves and shifted them by a constant vertical offset on this diagram we clearly see that the shock is stronger close to the accretor than far downstream in the wake and that its position is obviously the same for mass densities and tem peratures more interestingly the mass density reaches a maximum at the shock and decreases slowly within the cone shock even down to its value outside the shock beyond 6 hl this feature has also been glimpsed in numerical simulations of relativistic bhl flows onto spinning black holes see gracia linares and guzm n 2015 figure 3 following the publication of el mellah and casse 2015 we can also remark how the position of the successive maxima of temperature along the accretion line confirm a posteriori the assumption we made in section 5 1 2 that the sound speed does not evolve much in the wake of the accretor which tends to favour a concave shape for the shock from 6 to 0 5 hl the temperature approximately doubles which makes the sound speed only rise by a factor of p 2 31 outside of the simulation space presently covered 5 4 accretion properties of the bhl flow 97 figure 5 13 right vertically shifted transverse profiles of density blue and

the bhl flow 5 4 1 sonic surface for the bondi spherical model as seen in figure 4 5 whatever the mach number at infinity all flows feature a sonic radius which con verges to zero for monoatomic gas 5 3 indeed according to 4 27 the sonic radius of a monoatomic gas being accreted adiabatically is strictly zero 32 we made use of this critical point to determine the mass accretion rate in 4 28 and want now to export this approach to the bhl planar flow analytical insights in the case of the bhl flow in the case of a subsonic inflow the equation of the sonic surface has been studied by beskin and pidopry gora 1995 yet most of the astrophysical objects of interest we focus on undergo supersonic accretion we can make the case for ubiquitous supersonic flows using figure 5 4 where the scale of relative veloci ties of the gas with respect to the accretor at infinity can be related to the temperature with the following rule of thumb to convert the left velocity scale into a temperature one in kelvins for a mach 1 flow of hydrogen particles with 5 3 one can multiply 72 by the square of the velocity at infinity in km s 1 thus for a bulk motion at a few 100 km s 1 common if not underestimated in the systems we consider a temperature above almost one millions kelvins would be required to make this flow subsonic 33 if the symmetry of the problem guarantees the axisymmetry of the sonic surface in the steady state it is no longer simply described by one quantity like the sonic radius r 0 as illustrated by figure 5 14 the 32 in practice as the flow gets closer from the accretor it cannot remain adiabatic and will at some point radiate away a fraction of its energy the cooling terms are then no longer negligible 33 the reader might want to keep in mind that the temperature of the interstellar medium ranges from a few 10 to 106 k ferri re 2001 the latter corresponding to a sound speed of the order of 100 km s 1 98 chapter 5 planar flow accreted onto a compact body derivation of the polar curve r of the sonic surface is beyond the scope of our mathematical capacities but a topological property determined by foglizzo and ruffert 1996 guarantees that the sonic surface in tersects the corresponding sonic sphere whose radius is given by 4 27 for the same conditions at infinity indeed if one denotes s the cross section of a tube made of infinitesimally close streamlines in a specified direction and r the distance to the accretor foglizzo and ruffert 1996 pinpointed that the increase rate of s as a function of r verifies r s ds dr 2 if rs r 0 r s ds dr 2 if rs r 0 5 29 figure 5 14 sketch of the bhl flow where the unknown sonic surface has been represented in purple it turns out that it is ac tually anchored into the accre tor for 5 3 see text where rs is the distance from the accretor to the sonic surface in the direction considered and r 0 is the sonic radius set by the bernoulli invariant at infinity 34 for r 0 rs we retrieve the spherical case with a cross section which goes as the square of the distance to the center however for rs r 0 it evolves slower hence concave streamlines while for rs r 0 it evolves faster hence convex streamlines left panel of fig ure 5 15 for orthoradial velocities v of constant sign along the sonic surface on each side of the axis 35 we can rely on the right panel of fig ure 5 15 where the sonic sphere has been plotted in dotted dashed 36 to understand the implications of this result if some streamlines con verge to the accretor in a concave way on one side red streamlines they will occupy a larger angular fraction than if they had done so in a radial way and will necessarily force other streamlines to converge to the accretor in a convex way on the other side blue streamlines due to the equivalence between this convexity property and the position of the sonic surface with respect to the sonic sphere it means that the sonic surface will be above the sonic sphere in some directions and below in other ones by continuity the sonic surface does intersect the sonic sphere which implies for 5 3 that the sonic surface is anchored into the accretor numerical results an important conclusion of those simulations is the confirmation of foglizzo and ruffert s analytical prediction about the topology of the sonic surface for an adiabatic flow with 5 3 whatever the size of the inner boundary or the mach number of the supersonic flow fig ures 5 16 and 5 17 the sonic surface is always anchored into the in ner boundary and it extends along the wake of the accretor for super sonic flows the density distribution we found is mostly isotropic and the streamlines radial in the vicinity of the inner boundary 34 which is the same for all streamlines due to the homogeneity of the conditions at infinity 35 in appendix c of foglizzo and ruffert 1996 can be found a demonstration which shows that this assumption is actually not required to guarantee the intersection between the sonic surface and the sonic sphere 36 since the configuration is not spherical though the spherical sonic surface of radius r 0 has no proper physical sense in this situation its interest lies in its link with the actual sonic surface of this axisymmetric configuration 5 4 accretion properties of the bhl flow 99 figure 5 15 left 3 different configurations for the streamlines in a direction

relations to its spherical counterpart to estimate a lower limit on the mass accretion rate by computing it through the sonic surface 37 the result they obtained equation 108 in foglizzo and ruffert 1996 depends on the mach number at infinity and on a free parameter that we will constrain below with our numerical simulations to summarize they split the mass flux in 3 different components but only two of them are defined in a detached shock configuration as ours the mass flowing through the sonic surface and the mass flux through the angular sector where the flow is still subsonic right panel

larger as m decreases homogeneous normalization in the left panel of figure 5 18 is represented the evolution of the spatially averaged mass accretion rate in the vicinity of the inner boundary well below the shock front radius as a function of time it takes the system approximately 10 crossing times at most to relax the upstream outer boundary conditions specified in 4 1 2 of chapter 4 and to reach a plateau the normalisation of the mass accretion rates set by m hl is the same for all points m hl does not depend on the mach number at infinity which was evolved by changing c not v then we do observe larger mass accretion rates for colder ambient media at v and m fixed and with a saturation level measured by which is lower than the one prescribed by the qualitative model of hoyle lyttleton for each mach number we computed a time averaged mass accretion rate but beforehand we con struct a non physically motivated reference mass accretion rate m 0 whom only requirement is to verify m 0 m m hl m 0 m 0 m b 5 33 with the constant further discussed above indeed since bondi s derivation 4 29 for v c is based on the same physical laws as the ones we implemented the numerically computed mass accretion rates must tend towards m b for low m on the contrary hoyle lyttleton s qualitative approach does not make m hl more than an order of magnitude thus m 0 verifies the necessary asymptotic behaviors both at low and high mach numbers for any acceptable interpolation formula in no case m 0 should be taken as a physically meaningful formula by itself the structure requirement of m 0 relies on a quadratic average velocity v between v and c in the same spirit as bondi s interpolation formula albeit introducing a dependent weighting factor for c and a one for v v v 2 1 1 4 2 5 3 5 3 1 c 2 5 34 we then introduce the modified accretion radius re which compares the gravitational influence of the accreting body to the joint action of kinetic and enthalpic terms at infinity re gm v 2 2 c 2 s 1 5 35 in this way it continuously pinpoints the characteristic length scale from high to low mach numbers re m hl re m 0 gm c 2 s 1 5 36 102 chapter 5 planar flow accreted onto a compact body in the first asymptotic case re can be seen as the maximum impact parameter below which an amount of gravitational energy larger than the kinetic one at infinity will be converted into kinetic energy at constant pressure and entropy no shock in the second it is the radius below which thermodynamical properties of the gas have been significantly altered from their undisturbed state at infinity without major change of velocities eventually by writing m 0 r 2 e v a neutral formula not privileging a spherical nor an axisymmetric point of view we make m 0 verify the empirical condition 5 33 by setting the proportionality constant to m 0 r 2 e v 5 37 thanks to m 0 we have a homogeneous normalisation variable to compare the mass accretion rates to at any m numerical results and discussion the steady state mass accretion rates m are computed by averaging the instantaneous ones and the er ror bars from the dispersion both for t 10 crossing times once the steady state is reached the obtained m are presented in the right panel of figure 5 18 the error bars are smaller than markers extension but at low m the data dispersion is dominated by systematics whom influence is given by the three sets of points from the different inner boundary sizes as expected the traditional bondi intermediate formula 5 1 in blue dotted in figure 5 18 matches the hoyle lyttleton mass accretion rate at high mach numbers which itself turns out to be an overestimate of the actual mass accretion rate by approximately 30 it is consistent with the previous reports of m hl being a slight overestimate of the numerically observed mass accretion rates in the asymptotically supersonic regime see e g figure 7 of edgar 2004 yet since 5 1 does not properly include thermodynamics e g it does not depend on the adiabatic index it is a poor estimate in the subsonic regimes overestimating m by a factor up to 4 for 5 3 which corresponds to figure 5 18 left mass accretion rate as a function of time for different mach numbers and rin 10 3 hl the time unit is set by the crossing time hl v and the mass accretion rate unit by 4 12 right mass accretion rates m as a function of the mach number m

m b at low mach numbers given in the consistent and comprehensive review of ruffert 1994 b but surprisingly enough m bh is not too far off in the mildly supersonic one where the hoyle lyttleton formula is invoked with the velocity at infinity replaced by its quadratic average with the sound speed at infinity although pretty similar to ruffert s numerical conclusions ruffert 1994 a ruffert and arnett 1994 our results do not show any decreasing trend at high mach number and match the interpolation formula m fr in dashed red in the right panel of figure 5 18 in the asymptotically supersonic regime for 0 77 down to m 4 at a few percent precision level however the precision on could be limited by the numerical beaming along the 0 axis 38 mentioned in the section 5 3 2 although compensated by a similar depletion along the axis concerning the resolution dependency of our simulations with the higher resolution simulations we did not observe any significant change of the mass accretion rate beyond a 2 level in the case m 4 yet it turned out that the m 1 1 case gave accretion rates 5 to 10 lower in the high resolution runs which emphasizes the larger systematic uncertainties for mildly supersonic flows it also enables the reader to figure out an estimate of the systematic uncertainties in figure 5 18 we also grasp the main feature of the axisymmetric bhl flow that is to say an amplification by a few 10 of m around m 1 compared to the interpolation formulae 5 30 and 5 37 verifying m m 0 m b and m m m hl it must be noticed that for m 0 5 1 1 2 the mass accretion rates measured converge towards the interpolation formula derived by foglizzo and ruffert 1996 as rin hl drops with out fully settling down which is in agreement with the zero value of the sonic radius since the sonic surface is anchored into the accretor there are always directions of accretion where the flow is not super sonic the smaller the inner boundary size the closer the simulation from the model drawn in foglizzo and ruffert 1996 it can also be seen from direct visualization of the sonic surface in the right panel of figure 5 17 which tends to occupy an angular region around the inner boundary larger for smaller inner boundary radii given those elements those numerical m must be seen as upper limits of the ones one would get for a smaller absorbing 39 inner boundary due to the mostly radial streamlines in the vicinity of the inner boundary we can affirm that the ac cretion is regular in the sense that there is no infinite mass accretion rate direction although the local mass accretion rate is enhanced by a factor of a few units in the back hemisphere compared to the front hemisphere as a consequence the non isotropy of the mass accretion rates around the inner boundary is mostly due to the non isotropy of the velocity field along the mock accretion line in the wake of the accretor the flow has been more reaccelerated than upstream after the shock 5 5 discussion we designed a numerical setup optimized to embrace the whole dynamics of a 2 5 d planar hydrodynam ical bondi hoyle accretion flow onto a body whom size is 3 to 5 orders of magnitude smaller than its accretion radius reproducing typical weakly or non magnetized compact objects despite the challeng ing dynamics we are able to characterise the mass accretion rates for mach numbers at infinity ranging from 0 5 to 16 along with the geometrical properties of the flow the bow shock forming for supersonic flows the internal depletion of mass along the accretion line beyond the stagnation point and the tem perature jump at the shock are all in agreement with previous analytic solutions bisnovatyi kogan et al 1979 those simulations also emphasized the relevance of the sonic surface in the derivation of the mass accretion rates as first suggested by foglizzo and ruffert 1996 anchoring of the latter to the accretor surface allows one to set an analytical lower limit on the mass accretion rates and to understand at least qualitatively its dependence on the mach number for mildly supersonic flows we evaluated the under 38 visible in figure 5 9 for m 8 39 in the meaning of the inner boundary conditions described in 5 2 5 104 chapter 5 planar flow accreted onto a compact body estimation factor induced by such an approach by accounting for the whole mass flow not only through the supersonic surface but also in the subsonic angular section it is worth mentioning that the anchoring of the sonic surface shown here for the first time is a strong consistency check which brings robustness to the physical accuracy of those simulations furthermore we observed the relaxation towards a nu merically stationary regime which does not present any significant oscillatory behaviour discarding the growth of axisymmetric instabilities with this level of numerical dissipation concerning non axisymmet ric instabilities like the so called flip flop instability unfolding those 2 5 d setups in full 3 d would enable us to investigate whether its amplitude is similar to the 2 d cases the use of a proper energy equation alleviated the introduction of a polytropic index and ensured the anchoring of the sonic surface for any monoatomic ideal gas it also naturally handled the jump condi tions at the shock yet we relied on an adiabatic assumption which might overestimate the gas heating as matter flows in besides we neglect radiative feedbacks which are likely to play a role through for in stance the radiative pressure indeed comparing the eddington luminosity to the hoyle lyttleton mass accretion rate with a fiducial efficiency of 10 gives 10 m hlc 2 ledd 4 m 20 m v 106 m s 1 3 10 11 kg m 3 5 38 taking into account this radiative term in the energy equation is necessary for slower winds imbh park and ricotti 2013 or smbh novak et al 2011 persistent radiative feedback of accreting stellar mass black holes on their host primordial galaxies is also under current investigation along with the central su permassive black hole influence wheeler and johnson 2011 concerning orbital effects in binaries see theuns and jorissen 1993 theuns et al 1996 for sph simulations the present study has not included them but serves as a test case for a forthcoming work accounting for their effects yet if the orbitally in duced torque remains small enough those axisymmetric simulations are not expected to depart much from the actual configuration of sgxb where the mass transfer is believed to occur mainly through fast stellar winds thanks to our numerical setup which reconciles the requirement for physical size of the ac cretor together with the necessity to include the accretion radius within the simulation space we stepped through a numerical threshold beyond which we expect the wind accretion process at stake in binaries to be simulated comprehensively transition the present numerical setup serves as much as a model to study the evolution of a bhl flow depending on its mach number as a prerequisite to characterize the wind accretion process we constantly monitored our results to compare them to firmly established analytical constraints derived accurate numerical mass accretion rates and investigated the evolution of the properties of the flow with its mach number at infin ity from slightly subsonic to highly supersonic setups the bow shock forming for supersonic flows the internal depletion of mass along the accretion line and the temperature jump at the shock for instance it turns out that those simulations confirm the analytical prediction by foglizzo and ruffert 1996 con cerning the topology of the inner sonic surface using a continuously nested logarithmic mesh with a shock capturing algorithm and specific boundary conditions we can resolve the flow from the vicinity of the central compact object up to the significant deflection scale at an affordable computational price and with realistic wind velocities in agreement with the properties of bhl accretion on finite size objects we can finally reach numerical regimes where the size of the inner boundary no longer significantly alters the flow properties we solved the full set of hydrodynamical eulerian equations including the energy one with the less restrictive adiabatic assumption instead of considering a polytropic flow and identifying the adiabatic and the polytropic indexes with this first numerical test case of a bhl flow we paved the way to multi dimensional follow ups of fast flows encountering the gravitational well produced by a compact object much smaller than its accre tion radius the topology of the numerically derived sonic surface serves as a strong sanity check which drives us into adapting this setup to match the configuration of wind accreting x ray binaries in partic ular the orbital effects must be included chapter 7 along with the specificities of the radiatively driven wind emitted by the supergiant stellar companion chapter 6 indeed we will see that wind accretion oc curs preferentially in supergiant x ray binaries which host in addition of the compact accretor an early type evolved star with a large luminosity and mass loss rate in a binary system the evolutionary path of a massive star is drastically altered by the presence of a nearby companion if the nature of the binary interaction is largely determined by the initial orbital period and mass ratio of the system the role of mass transfer in shaping the evolution of a high mass star remains uncertain partly because of the paucity of measurements of the intrinsic distributions of orbital and stellar parameters to constrain the latter the approach we advocate is to use the coupling between the stellar orbital wind and accretion parameters in supergiant x ray binaries in a ballistic framework we designed a toy model to follow the evolution of streamlines and the subsequent observables as a function of a reduced set of characteristic numbers and scales we show that the shape of the permanent flow is entirely deter mined by the mass ratio the filling factor the eddington factor and the force multiplier provided scales such as the orbital period are known we can trace back the observables to evaluate the mass accretion rates the accretion mechanism wind or stream dominated the shearing of the inflow and the stellar pa rameters this setup also provides us with physically motivated outer boundary conditions to investigate the vicinity of the accretor and focus on the bottom line problematic of this phd

thoroughly studied unlike intermediate and low mass stars i e below a few solar masses where winds are believed to be sustained by thermal pressure gradient 1 massive stars harbour photo spheres hot enough to emit a significant fraction of the light above the ionization frequency of metals their interaction with the partly ionized atoms section 6 2 1 in the outer layers of the star provides a sig nificant amount of net linear momentum to the gas 6 2 3 much more important than the one from con tinuous radiative pressure on free electrons 6 1 1 a wind develops 6 3 2 and reaches terminal speeds of the order of a few times the escape velocity at the stellar surface 6 3 4 in this section we only tackle the case of isolated stars the coupling with the roche potential described in chapter 7 will be done later on in chapter 8 this section settles for a short reminder of some features we will use later on to study sgxb for more detailed and comprehensive reviews the reader can refer to the chapter 7 of lamers and cassinelli 1999 and to the reviews by kudritzki and puls 2000 and puls et al 2008 1 which requires a hot corona with temperatures high enough to reproduce the terminal speed observed for the sun the heating mechanism responsible for this corona is an intense object of research see e g xia et al 2011 but it is believed that the magnetic field produced by convective motions in the outer layers of the star plays a major role yet beyond a few solar masses the outer layers are no longer convective but radiative see shu 1992 for a first glimpse of the question with the schwarzschild buoyancy criterion 109 110 chapter 6 winds of hot stars 6 1 continuous radiative pressure 6 1 1 thomson scattering on free electrons thomson scattering describes the interaction of light with free charged particles in the outer stellar lay ers free electrons from fully ionized hydrogen will be the privileged partners due to their low inertia 2 we thereby undertake a corpuscular interpretation of this model but a wave one is also possible and would give strictly the same results the incoming photon 3 excites a free electron which oscillates and isotrop ically 4 emits a photon at the same frequency as the absorbed one following larmor s result on radiation emitted by accelerated charged particles 5 the absorption does not depend on the wavelength which justifies the name of continuous radiative pressure we will sometimes use to refer to this process as opposed to line absorption in section 6 2 1 since the initially absorbed photons come from the photosphere below there is a net gain of linear momentum for the electrons which then redistribute it to the ambient flow via coulomb dragging the thomson cross section of a free particle of charge q and of mass m can be shown to be in cgs e 8 3 q 2 mc 2 2 6 1 where c is the speed of light this expression shows why free electrons have more influence than free protons if in equal quantity given their smaller mass for an assembly of free electrons in a stellar atmo sphere if we write ihe the number of electrons provided per helium nucleus 6 and y the number fraction of helium with respect to hydrogen 7 we get the total opacity 8 e of the stellar material kudritzki et al 1989 e 0 398 1 ihe y 1 4 y cm 2 g 1 6 2 since the radiation pressure is given by the ratio of the stellar flux f by the speed of light once we account for the cross section we get the outwards acceleration exerted on the flow 9 gthomson e f c 6 3 the opacity e varies little in the wind and will be considered in this manuscript to be constant and homogeneous as a consequence the radial dependence of this acceleration term is the same as the one of the stellar flux it decreases as the square of the distance to the stellar center this statement invites to compare this acceleration to the gravitational one which follows the same radial evolution 6 1 2 the eddington limit the outer layers are bounded to the star by gravitation but subjected to continuous radiative pressure 10 if the latter overcomes the former the star undergoes consequent mass losses much more important than 2 bound electrons can also interact as we will see in section 6 2 1 3 an electromagnetic wave in the wave approach hence the need for a charged particle 4 given the fact that we do not work with relativistic flows here this term does not suffer any ambiguity and can be understood in the frame of the star or the accelerated particle 5 inelastic scattering is to be expected if the rest mass energy of the particle 511 kev for an electron is lower than the energy of the interacting photon 6 typically 2 for an o star 7 set to 20 in this manuscript 8 cross section per unit mass of proton 9 remarkably enough the opacity does not depend on the light frequency which makes the integration of the flux per frequency over the whole frequency range straightforward and immediately yields the total stellar flux f 10 and to a lesser extent for massive stars to thermal pressure and centrifugal force 6 2 global properties of a line driven wind 111 the outflows driven by line absorption we will introduce below the luminosity it takes to reach this limit is called the eddington luminosity and is given by ledd gm r 2 gthomson 4 gmc e 42 000 l m 1 m 0 31 cm 2 g 1 e 6 4 where m is the mass of the star g the gravitational constant and the value of e has been obtained with the formula and the figures mentioned in the previous section for a star like the sun it shows that the continuous radiative pressure does little to counterbalance gravity but since luminosity evolves faster than mass its importance is no longer negligible for massive ob stars so as to quantify the latter we introduce the dimensionless eddington factor the ratio of the stellar luminosity l by its eddington luminosity l ledd 6 5 it evaluates the relative importance of continuous radiative pressure with respect to gravitation for ob star it can reach 30 11 due to the similar evolution of the gravitational and continuous radiative accelerations is a constant set by the stellar parameters and one can define an effective gravity and by then an effective escape speed by lowering the stellar gravity with a factor 1 however this phenomenon can not be responsible for the launching of a wind due to this very reason either the continuous radiative pressure overcomes the stellar gravity at every radius and additional limiting effects come into play 12 or it does not and will never be large enough whatever the distance to the stellar center to drive a wind 6 2 global properties of a line driven wind 6 2 1 compton scattering on metal ions compton scattering covers the wide scope of interactions between a photon and free charged particles it encompasses the thomson case described above but is more general since the scattering can be inelastic the energy of the photon reemiteed by the particle of mass m has a lower energy than the incident photon a quick computation can be carried on to evaluate the linear momentum brought to a particle as it absorbs and reemits a photon in a direction with respect to the incident one figure 6 1 without loosing much of the essential results we can consider the original emitting source as a point such as if we consider only pristine photons from the photosphere which have not been scattered yet this initial direction is actually a radius we also write vr the radial components of the velocity the only one we are interested in here after the absorption of a photon at in the frame initially comoving with the absorber the latter is provided an additional velocity along the direction of the incident photon mvr 2 mvr 1 h c 6 6 where 1 refers to before the absorption and 2 to after the absorption the absorber now finds itself in an excited state as we will see in a minute when we will tackle the nature of the interaction itself rather than its dynamical effects on the particle but in the blink of an eye it relaxes by emitting a photon at in a random direction in its reference frame which alters once again its momentum accordingly mvr 3 mvr 2 h c cos 6 7 if we express the gain of momentum between the initial and final states as a function of the rest frequency 11 for wolf rayet stars and luminous blue variables it even gets higher 12 an altered coupling between matter and radiation in clumpy winds since photons tend to escape through the more tenuous gas between optically thick clumps can allow a star with 1 to remain stable van marle et al 2009 112 chapter 6 winds of hot stars corresponding to i e 0 1 vr 1 c we have mvr 3 mvr 1 h c cos h c h 0 c 1 vr 2 c cos h 0 c 1 vr 1 c 6 8 for non relativistic velocities and photon energies well below the rest mass of the scattering particle we have injecting 6 6 in 6 8 mvr 3 mvr 1 h 0 c 1 cos 6 9 since is uniformly sampled between 0 and we have the following net gain of linear momentum mvr 3 mvr 1 h 0 c 0 2 0 1 cos sin d d 4 h 0 c 6 10 where is the east west coordinate of the spherical coordinates eventually it shows that the momentum increase by isotropic scattering is the same as for the case of pure absorption of a photon at 0 concerning the phenomenon responsible for absorption and spontaneous emission itself it is mostly because of the excitation of electrons in partly ionized metal atoms c n o ne si p s and fe group ele ments they are excited as they absorb the light provided they have still bound electrons left the energy it takes to excite one of the electrons of the atom to a higher energy level is typically an electron volt in agreement with the uv x photons one can find from the photosphere of massive stars the relaxation is triggered either by collisions if the plasma is dense enough or by the heisenberg characteristic timescale deduced from the ratio of the planck constant by the energy between levels hence the blink of an eye above the sharp and magnified response of resonant atomic lines to photons with the right frequency 0 quickly makes those lines optically thick they absorb all the photons available at this frequency and figure 6 1 lower panel absorption of a photon with frequency by a particle with a velocity vr along the direction of incident light upper panel spontaneous emission of a photon with frequency in a direction identified with the angle with respect to the initial direction of incident light as it does so the velocity of the particle along the direction of incident light goes from v r to v r from lamers and cassinelli 1999 6 2 global properties of a line driven wind 113 are accelerated 13 as they do so they see the stellar surface recede and are able to absorb photons of higher energy energy previously untouched they keep accelerating and if the metal atoms transfer their momentum to their plasma mates faster than they are accelerated see next section 6 2 2 a bulk motion appears the wind is launched 6 2 2 momentum redistribution the ambient gas in the stellar atmosphere contains ions which are coupled with each other and in par ticular with the ones among them which are the most involved in the line acceleration process due to their high resonant opacity is this coupling strong enough to redistribute the gained linear momentum to the surrounding particle and induce a bulk motion the coupling is done through coulomb interactions between the metal ions and the field particles as the latter exerts a drag on the former momentum is redistributed if this redistribution occurs on a timescale smaller than the acceleration timescale tacc a bulk motion appears the latter can be evaluated by monitoring the time it takes given an acceleration representative of the one exerted on metal ions to reach a velocity of the order of the sound speed once compared to the coulomb dragging timescale we can affirm that the coupling is strong enough to drive a global motion of the plasma is the absolute mass loss rate m is above a certain limit set by the stellar luminosity l and the velocity of the flow v lamers and cassinelli 1999 m 2 10 9 l 105 l v 1000 km s 1 m yr 1 6 11 this result is an additional explanation to the absence of significant line driven winds in later than b spec tral type stars 14 where the mass outflows observed are below this threshold the sun for instance displays a mass loss rate through its wind which is of the order of 10 14 m yr 1 which is slightly below the corre sponding threshold while ob star displays mass loss rates 3 orders of magnitude above this threshold as we will see later on 6 2 3 wind mass rate we now evaluate the total energy and momentum deposited in the wind by stellar radiation to do so we consider only one absorption line at a frequency 0 optically thick enough to absorb every photon available we write f the stellar flux at frequency and the light rays are supposed to be purely radial point source see section 6 3 5 for a refinement as the flow accelerates from negligible speeds up to the terminal speed v it absorbs higher energy photons than the ones at 0 due to their doppler reddening all the photons between 0 and 0 1 v c will then be absorbed the total luminosity transferred to the wind momentum is given by for v c labs 0 1 v c 0 4 r 2 f d 6 12 where r is the stellar radius this luminosity accounts for the wind momentum which is given by if one assumes a blackbody spectrum for the flux f m v labs c 0 6 l c 2 v 6 13 this expression highlights an important feature which still holds if we go through a more rigorous deriva tion the mass accretion rate can be determined independently from the wind velocity at infinity in particular for neff effective optically thick absorption line we have m neffl c 2 7 10 7 l 105 l neff 100 6 14 13 optically thin absorption lines also decrease as r 2 and can not account for the launching of the wind kudritzki and puls 2000 14 in addition to the scarcity of photons energetic enough 114 chapter 6 winds of hot stars figure 6 2 stellar black body spectrum the grey area represents the band fully absorbed by the wind given the absorption line at 0 at rest and the velocity at infinity v we considered in section 6 2 3 from lamers and cassinelli 1999 where neff has been set so as to approximately yield mass loss rates in agreement with the ones observed for ob stars if all photons of the blackbody stellar spectrum are absorbed once and the contribution of reemitted photons is neglected single scattering assumption labs l we then get an upper limit on the wind momentum at infinity comparing the actual one to this maximum amount can be accomplished through the wind efficiency number neff v c 6 15 in this section we implicitly neglected the contribution of reemitted photons it is the single scattering assumption 15 this is a reasonable hypothesis if there are few enough absorption lines in the wind or if they are spaced enough such as the reemitted photon has little chance to be absorbed otherwise it will contribute by being absorbed by another atomic transition in this case can not go over 1 if one wants to relax the single scattering assumption and exceeds 1 proper monte carlo techniques must resorted to in order to follow the path of a photon and its successive scatterings vink 2000 multiple scatterings have little influence on the winds of ob supergiants but are important for the winds of wolf rayet stars or luminous blue variables for ob supergiants the previous comments enable us to predict a mass outflow between the coulomb coupling lower limit and the single scattering limit 2 10 9 l 105 l v 1000 km s 1 m 1 m yr 1 2 10 6 l 105 l 1000 km s 1 v 6 16 in solar masses per year yet to get a precise value within this range we now need to consider the ex plicit expression of the line absorption acceleration we will see that the mass outflows generated by this process are rather on the high limit on the range above 15 in practice as long as sobolev s framework holds it is meaningful to neglect the role of scattered photons whose energy is quickly i e after at most a few scattering too low anyway especially with respect to the receding ions to be reabsorbed 6 3 dynamics of the wind 115 6 3 dynamics of the wind 6 3 1 acceleration term the derivation of the acceleration term is out of the scope of the present manuscript but can be found either in the seminal papers castor et al 1975 or in more recent publications lamers and cassinelli 1999 the sobolev approximation sobolev 1960 enables to write the optical depth as a local quantity 16 modulated by the radial velocity gradient 17 in the cak model for castor abbott klein after summation over all contributing atomic lines using the convenient force multipliers we obtain the following force per unit mass ud doula and owocki 2002 gcak 1 1 eql 4 r 2 c 1 r e cq dv dr gm r 2 q 1 1 r e cq dv dr 6 17 where is the mass density q and are the force multipliers and the factor in parenthesis is a dimen sionless optical depth we recognize the continuous radiative pressure force gm r 2 in the r h s the force multiplier evaluates the relative contribution of strong and weak lines to the acceleration of the wind for 0 we recover the optically thin case where absorption decreases as r 2 while for 1 all lines are optically thick the original works substituted to q the k force multiplier 18 but the former introduced by gayley 1995 has proved to be more satisfying both for computational and physical rea sons indeed k depends on the stellar surface temperature because of the use of the thermal speed at the surface in castor et al 1975 instead of a constant such as the speed of light above on the other hand q is fairly independent of and the effective stellar temperature it is a dimensionless effective quality factor which evaluates the global efficiency level of the absorption lines wind acceleration with respect to the continuous radiative pressure on free electrons though the latter are way more numerous than elec trons bound in metallic ions whose transitions intercept the stellar continuum q typically reaches 103 in ob supergiants there exists an additional force multiplier introduced by abbott 1982 to take the non homogeneity of the ionization level in the wind into account including it consistently in our binary model would require to also account for the self ionization of the accretion flow an effect we discarded for reasons explained in more details in chapter 8 thus in our steady state framework we make the assumption of a frozen in ionization state 0 whose consequences are discussed in greater details in section 4 1 of kudritzki et al 1989 the proper calculation of the force multipliers like for neff in section 6 2 3 requires stellar atmo spheric models we will not address here their values are provided in tables such as table 1 of gayley 1995 or table 2 of abbott 1982 for as a function of the effective stellar temperature the surface grav ity the stellar metallicity 19 and the photosphere electronic density for the ob supergiant we will focus on in this work ranges from 0 45 to 0 65 while q stays approximately constant around 1 000 shimada et al 1994 6 3 2 ballistic equation of motion in the point source limit in a very analogue way as the approach we undertake to study bondi spherical accretion section 4 2 we write the steady state hydrodynamical equation of conservation of the mass and linear momentum along 16 strictly speaking integrations along ray tracks should be performed to evaluate the acceleration term see the computations realized in the comoving frame without the sobolev approximation 17 due to the aforementioned doppler shift 18 k q 1 1 vth c q 1 1 t 5 5 1012 k 2 19 the acceleration term is believed to be approximately proportional to the metallicity since the launching of the wind implies metal ions see the figure 10 of kudritzki and puls 2000 for a visualisation of the systematic bias on the terminal speed of the wind for lower metallicity stars in the small and large magellanic clouds 116 chapter 6 winds of hot stars the radial axis 20 but with the two additional radiative acceleration

expressions of the eddington luminosity 6 4 and the eddington factor 6 5 to rewrite the thomson scattering radiative pressure force in an ob supergiant we can safely neglect the thermal pressure since the envelope is radiatively dominated 23 it is equivalent to ignoring the discrepancy between the stellar radius and the sonic point slightly above given the velocity profiles we will obtain it is clear that the flow becomes supersonic quickly enough after it leaves the stellar surface to not significantly alter the whole velocity profile and the mass loss rate something we will verify a posteriori let us make these equations dimensionless to highlight the decisive parameters at stake in this prob lem the natural dimension quantities one can think about are the stellar radius r for length and p gm 1 r for the velocities then multiplying by r 2 and using the conservation of mass above to express the mass density as a function of the mass outflow rate in the conservation of linear momentum we have the scaled equation of motion x 1 x with x vr 2 dv dr 6 19 where the dimensionless parameter is a constant given by 1 1 q 1 1 l m c 2 n eff 6 20 equation 6 19 is an equality which can not be verified for any x but one in particular x is a constant if we plot the function f x x x 1 as a function of x for a fiducial and different values of figure 6 3 it appears that there exists a critical value of below which there is no x solution for the equation f x 0 above which there are two solutions and for which there is a unique one since the mass loss rate in 6 20 can not be degenerated i e bi valued it means that is given by this precise critical value and the corresponding value of x can be found by looking for the extremum of the expression 6 19 with respect to x x 11 6 21 this mathematical singularity plays a similar role as the one played by the sonic point in the case of bondi accretion and will naturally lead to an evaluation of the mass loss rate in the incoming section 6 3 4 meanwhile we head towards an analytic derivation of the velocity profile 6 3 3 velocity profile the velocity profile summoned by observers to model the wind of hot stars the so called wind see e g wen et al 1999 finds its theoretical justification in the use of the previous results indeed if we inject the expression 6 21 of the critical x in 6 19 we have x 1 6 22 20 the former is the integrated form while the latter is in its local form 21 gthomson for the continuous and gcak for the line absorption 22 we saw in section 6 1 2 that the radiative pressure can be included in the gravity term via the eddington factor 23 see lamers and cassinelli 1999 for a quantification of the small influence of the thermal pressure 6 3 dynamics of the wind 117 figure 6 3

thick black horizontal line stands for y 0 and its intersection with the 3 curves indicate the roots of 6 19 which can be integrated from the stellar surface where the velocity can be taken to be zero up to infinity to first determine the dimensioned terminal speed v vesc m 1 6 23 where vesc m is the modified escape velocity p 2 gm 1 r we then determine the velocity profile v r v 1 r r 0 5 6 24 the ratio of the modified escape speed by the thermal speed of the flow at the stellar surface is given approximately by vesc m cs 2 1 000 m 15 m 1 1 1 0 1 r 18 r 1 t 20 kk 1 6 25 which shows that given the fiducial velocity profile plotted in figure 8 5 the flow quickly becomes super sonic as it rises above the stellar surface which washes out the influence of the thermal pressure in 6 18 more generally the exponent 0 5 which appears in 6 24 along with the terminal speed v are usually fit ted to observational data 24 as degrees of freedom the former being written hence the wind profile the resulting values and trends are exponents above 0 5 and larger terminal speeds and evolving with 1 instead see e g table 3 in crowther et al 2006 or table 8 in searle et al 2008 for b supergiants refinements such as the one presented in section 6 3 5 help to bridge the gap between the predicted and observed values 6 3 4 mass loss rate and terminal velocity accurate mass loss rates are decisive elements to better appreciate the evolutionary tracks of massive stars it is also tells us more about the feedback on the interstellar medium coleiro 2013 we make use of the singularity which forces the parameter given by 6 20 to a specific value to compute the mass loss rate of the cak model in the point source limit it gives the mass loss rate m as a function of the stellar 24 see kudritzki and puls 2000 and puls et al 2008 for more information about the way we derive the observed wind proper ties 118 chapter 6 winds of hot stars figure 6 4 wind velocity profile for 0 6 and 0 5 i e the theoretical expectation for the simple most cak model luminosity l and of several dimensionless parameters its eddington factor the force multiplier and the q force multiplier m ledd c 2 1 q 1 1 6 26 where c is the speed of light and ledd is the eddington luminosity the latter is preferred to the stellar luminosity as a normalization quantity since within a given range of stellar masses it varies more slowly than the former typically by a factor at most 3 given the range of masses we consider a slightly more realistic mass loss rate but with similar dependences m is represented in figure 6 5 and given by 50 of 6 26 see the incoming section 6 3 5 it shows that optically thicker winds gives much smaller mass loss rates almost a decade smaller for going from 0 45 to 0 55 higher stellar luminosities for a given stellar mass also favour larger mass loss rates with mass outflows approximately 10 times more important for 0 3 than for 0 1 for 0 5 eventually the q force multiplier likely to lie between 500 and 2000 accounts for a variation of a factor 4 1 4 given the range of mass outflows we observe for stellar companions in sgxb this sketch is consistent with the force multipliers determined by shimada et al 1994 or gayley 1995 for ob supergiants 6 3 5 correction for finite cone angle effect the previously summarized results can be conveniently analytically derived because we worked with the simplified form 6 17 of the line acceleration term ensued from the point source approximation all the photons absorbed were moving radially outwards however in the vicinity of the stellar surface where most of the acceleration takes place the star can hardly be approximated by a point and a significant fraction of the photons absorbed do not move radially in figure 6 6 one can see that photons at a given frequency can be absorbed at different distances provided they come from more inclined regions and thus sees the same projected relative velocity the vectors in red in figure 6 6 it is another feature not accounted for in the bedrock model and which does alter the velocity profile a precise quantification of this cone angle effect a k a finite disk effect shows that the new line acceleration term gfd is given by pauldrach et al 1986 friend and abbott 1986 gfd gcak d 6 27 6 3 dynamics of the wind 119 figure 6 5 stellar mass outflow as a function of the force

refinement does not alter the shape of the velocity profile too much which is now a law profile with an exponent not necessarily equal to 0 5 the evolution of this factor d as a function of the radius for law velocity profiles with different exponents is shown in figure 6 7 we retrieve d 1 at large distance where the star does look like a point source and d amounts to 1 1 1 at the stellar surface semi analytical models and numerical computations have been developed to fully take this effect into account friend and abbott 1986 villata 1992 m ller and vink 2008 araya et al 2014 noebauer and sim 2015 and provide self consistent estimates of the mass loss rate and the terminal speed of the wind they all agree within a level of precision sufficient for our model of sgxb on a halved mass outflow m 0 5 m and a terminal speed given by v 2 5 1 vesc m 6 30 instead of 6 23 it must be noticed that this result holds for stellar effective temperatures above the bi stability jump threshold of the order of 20 000 k vink et al 1999 kudritzki and puls 2000 typically below the temperatures we observe sgxb more precisely we will see later on in section 8 2 2 that in models where the sonic surface and the stellar surface are at the same level the mass accretion rate can be analytically corrected for the finite cone effect by writing m 1 1 1 m 6 31 for the values of we explore it does correspond to a factor of almost 50 it is the mass outflow we consider by default from now on 6 3 6 wind momentum luminosity relationship in the 90 s kudritzki et al 1994 and puls et al 1996 emphasized a relation between the modified wind momentum and the stellar luminosity the so called wind momentum luminosity relationship wlr once properly calibrated this relation could prove to be a reliable extra galactic distance indicator by using purely spectroscopic information puls et al 2008 the modified wind momentum dmom is given by dmom m v r r 1 1 1 2 5 p 2 c 2 p r e 4 c 1 1 2 gm 1 32 1 q 1 l 1 6 32 where we used the modified expression of the mass loss rate given by 6 26 and 6 30 for the terminal speed we wrote dmom so as to highlight the primary role of the force multiplier to set the strength of the dependence between dmom and the different parameters for realistic values of dmom depends first on the stellar luminosity and then on the q force multiplier the mass of the star and its eddington parameter have little influence on the modified wind momentum as an illustration we compared this relationship for different values of to observational data for early type b supergiants from searle et al 2008 believed to be isolated analogues of the stellar com panions we will study in more details in sgxb see figure 15 by searle et al 2008 for similar plots a dependence on the spectral

hot supergiant star first we presented the simplest form of the cak theory so as to guide the reader in the realm of analytically solvable equations and derived the qualitative trends which still hold for more so phisticated versions then we succinctly introduced an important refinement to bridge the quantitative gap between observed and predicted terminal speeds with the cone angle effect taken into account we must finally acknowledge the abundance of works concerning more realistic wind models in short the following questions are still under investigation within the community devoted to a better understanding of those winds albeit not necessarily in relation with sgxb 1 multiple scattering in a configuration where the mass outflow exceeds the single scattering limit 25 the large relative uncertainties on the fitted for early b type supergiants make any conclusive statement hazardous but it seems that the derived from the wlr are somewhat larger than the ones found from atmospheric models although accounting for the force multiplier lowers this discrepancy 6 4 conclusion 123 photons are scattered more than once and provide an additional momentum to the wind vink et al 1999 the subsequent enhancement of the mass loss rate is significant for wolf rayet and possi bly for hypergiant stars such wray 977 the stellar companion in the hypertrophied sgxb gx 301 2 leahy and kostka 2008 servillat et al 2014 2 wind blanketing when multiple scattering comes into play it becomes possible for the radiative energy to be scattered back to the star and heat the photosphere the wind acts as a blanket then and profoundly alters the thermal structure of the upper photospheric layers 3 clumpiness line driven instabilities have been revealed since the very first papers on winds of hot stars lucy and solomon 1970 in the 80 s the effect has been quantified by owocki and rybicki 1984 and owocki and rybicki 1985 numerical simulations have brought some insight on the structure of a clumpy wind dessart and owocki 2005 and models have been developed including in the case of sgxb ducci et al 2009 4 porosity it is possible that the clumpiness is large enough in some winds that the clumps are opti cally thick and most of the mass lost is contained in the clumps in this case since observations are mostly sensible to the clumps assuming a homogeneous wind would lead to overestimated mass loss rates the altered coupling between matter and radiation can be quantified relying on porosity approaches owocki et al 2004 5 force multiplier the non homogeneity of the ionization state of the flow can be modelled in a first approximation with the inclusion of an additional force multiplier in the case of sgxb where the ionizing flux from the compact object will dominate it is likely to not be a good approximation to account for and discard the radiative feedback of the accreted flow 6 stellar rotation massive stars start their life as fast rotators which breaks up the assumption of a purely radial and isotropic flow around the star puls et al 2008 in be xb where the donor star is fastly rotating this has to be taken into account to justify the formation of a decretion disk around the star 7 stellar magnetic field since it plays a role in the structure of the properties of the stellar surface critical for the launching of the wind the stellar magnetic field must have an influence on the prop erties of the wind our intention is not to provide a thorough description of winds of isolated hot stars but to encompass enough of their essential properties to explain the observed trends in sgxb in this respect we did not include those effects in the current model we introduce in chapter 8 we can now rely on this semi analytical approach to implement a numerical configuration where a low mass compact object orbits a massive supergiant star without altering the launching mechanism of its wind 124 chapter 6 winds of hot stars

naively applying a conservation of angular momentum argument such as in 1 1 4 leads to excessively large radii for the subsequently formed proto star a workaround which has been suggested to overcome the centrifugal barrier responsible for these radii is to split the initial angular momentum between different bodies orbiting each other most of the angular momentum goes into the orbital one with in addition the spins of the fragments this process could explain the large if not major fraction of systems composed of two or more stellar mass objects see duch ne and kraus 2013 for a recent review on stellar multi plicity frequency and dependences making the solar system an outlier in addition it is now seriously considered that the multiplicity is positively correlated to the initial mass of the stars the more massive the more pressing the need for a partner to distribute angular momentum into two spins and an orbital one mason et al 2009 sana et al 2012 outnumbering the isolated stars the binary systems also play a decisive role in shaping their host galaxy providing the energy the metal enriched gas and sometimes the trigger for the upcoming generations of stars we will not tackle the question of the formation of multiple star systems but more information can be found in the section 3 1 of a coleiro s phd coleiro 2013 and references therein if the time evolution of isolated stars is now well constrained their combined evolution in binary sys tems remain largely speculative given the plentiful possible evolutionary tracks however the interplay between the two bodies we witness in binary systems gives us the occasion to reach extraordinary levels of precisions when it comes to stellar parameters 1 see bakos et al 2010 for an example of impressive 1 asteroseismology has also

most luminous star as its companion passes by albrecht et al 2007 opening the door to statistical data on spin orbit misalignment and providing insightful constrains on the tidal interactions between

et al 2015 credits alma eso naoj nrao but the picture is still incomplete if our sta tistical knowledge of those systems has been con siderably broadened by large scale surveys 3 we re main unable to fully appreciate the evolutionary singularities which may account for the different spectral and time variability found in x ray bina ries an evolved stage of binary systems sophis ticated stellar models draw conclusions for the evolution of isolated stars which still not fit the bill for binaries for example discrepancies be tween evolutionary and spectroscopic masses re main historically the algol paradox illustrates the specificities of stellar evolution in a binary system which sometimes involves mass transfer see sec tion 7 2 the mutual irradiation of the two stars 4 clearly observed on bolometric light curves can also alter the properties of the outer layers and the stellar mass loss rates in this sense x ray bi naries offer a snapshot of a short lived phase of binary systems where the intertwining of the two bodies displays a rich and complex behavior we have to investigate the understanding of stel lar evolution will not be satisfying as long as this ephemerous yet

different frequencies 5 for laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory 128 chapter 7 binary systems and virgo collaborations abbott et al 2016 a b has just ushered in a gold rush to study those systems from a privileged and previously unseen angle in a first part we remind the reader about the theoretical framework of binary systems and in partic ular the roche potential as a guideline to appreciate the trajectory of test masses when the coriolis force can be neglected then we go on with a few reminders about the effects of mass transfer over secular time scales 6 and use them to justify the bimodality in the observed distribution of stellar mass in x ray binaries 7 1 the roche model 7 1 1 context the roche model has been first designed by the xixth century astronomer edouard roche it takes place in a rotating framework at constant angular speed vector where two point masses henceforth indexed 1 and 2 produce a gravitational field see figure 7 4 the center of mass cm is used as the origin of the framework so as to relate this model to celestial mechanics of an isolated system of two bodies the distance between those points is not left at the physicist s discretion but is set by kepler s third law the latter is deduced from the conservation of the angular momentum vector which guarantees to the system a constant orbital plane and an orbital separation a set by a 3 2 g m 1 m 2 7 1 where mi refers to the mass of the point i 7 1 2 the roche potential expression now let us consider a test mass i e a point of mass m m 1 m 2 so it does not produce any significant gravitational field it experiences the two gravitational forces from 1 and 2 along with the two non inertial forces 7 m dv d t gm 1 m r r 1 3 r r 1 gm 2 m r r 2 3 r r 2 m 2 r 2 m v 7 2 where v is the velocity vector of the test mass in the co rotating frame and r is the position vector of the projection of the test mass on the orbital plane r r r z z the vectors r 1 and r 2 locate the two masses with respect to the center of mass it clearly appears in this equation that the motion is independent of the mass of the test mass provided m m 1 m 2 it turns out that the 3 first forces are conservative i e they can be written via a potential 8 called the roche potential r r gm 1 r r 1 gm 2 r r 2 1 2 2 r 2 7 3 which is not the case of the coriolis force even if the latter can not be called dissipative either since it does no work an important point to make concerning this potential is that it no longer displays the convenient isotropy of an isolated point mass as a consequence the angular momentum of the test mass has no reason to be constant which can sound paradoxical since the system composed of 1 2 keeps the same angular momentum and the whole system is isolated this physical artefact is to be attributed to the 6 which refers to stellar evolutionary time scales in this manuscript of the order of the nuclear timescale 7 notice that if 1 and 2 are on non circular orbits eccentric ones or even on free trajectories this formalism still applies provided we relax the constant angular speed assumption adding a new fictitious force the so called euler force the latter case is of particular interest when it comes e g to tidal disruption events see 2 2 2 8 one can always write the force as a spatial gradient if there is a first integral of the motion which is guaranteed if the time coordinate does not show up by other means than through the spatial component 7 1 the roche model 129 figure 7 3 left logarithmic colormap of the roche model with the two point

is the roche surface passing through the first lagrangian point l 1 the latter has been represented with the black dot at the crossing of the critical isopotential a is the orbital separation the different vectors used to express the roche potential have been represented with the center of mass cm as the origin of the framework whose basis can be found in the upper right corner for the sake of clarity the test mass belongs to the orbital plane here http meshlab sourceforge net 130 chapter 7 binary systems assumption m m 1 m 2 when the test mass separates from 1 strictly speaking it modifies m 1 and in doing so the orbital separation and the distribution of angular momentum this point can no longer be put aside when one considers the secular evolution of a binary system and a dynamical roche potential must be considered see section 7 2 if the norm of the angular momentum vector of a test mass can change its direction remains colinear to the angular speed vector provided its initial position and velocity vectors belongs to the orbital plane the motion of such a test mass trapped in the orbital plane can be appreciated with the analogy of a rolling marble on a 2 d surface in a homogeneous gravity field as long as the coriolis force plays a minor role the vertical motion of the marble then traces the potential while its horizontal motion follows the actual motion of the test mass in the orbital plane let us discuss the shape and the amplitude of this surface represented in figure 7 3 the scale and the shape this restricted three body problem 9 first seems to require the prior of three parameters typically the two masses and the orbital separation yet equation 7 3 can be adimensioned in order to differentiate the shape from the scale parameters r r r 0 q r r 1 1 r r 2 1 2 1 q r 2 7 4 where the shape of second factor on the r h s is entirely determined by the mass ratio and with r 0 gm 2 a r 1 11 q x r 2 q 1 q x 7 5 the tildes stand for the length normalized to the orbital separation a a change in the orbital separation then only leads to a stretching of the potential but not to a different shape the shape is scale invariant once the length scale and the potential scale have been set at a and r 0 respectively the corresponding dimensionless equation of motion is given by dv d t r 2 1 q z v 7 6 where the tildes have been omitted and the velocity has been scaled with the square root of r 0 we notice that even the coriolis force depends only on the mass ratio such as in the end the shape of the trajectories remains unchanged by a modification of the scale it only depends on the dimensionless quantity q such a distinction between scale and shape parameters look straightforward on this academic exam ple but will be extended in the more complicated case where the wind launching of the supergiant star is included in the next chapter the key element to grasp with this separation is that it is an essential prerequisite before running any numerical computation indeed the scale parameters intervene only as a posteriori multiplicative factors of numerical outputs since the latter do not depend on the physical units though what is physically a problem with 3 degrees of freedom is numerically a problem with only one degree of freedom the scaling being performed afterwhile in a much less computationally demanding stage a similar reduction of the parameter space dimensionality will not only be a decisive computa tional time saving feature but also a gateway to physical interpretations rather than plain descriptions of the results 9 concerning the actual three body problem its formal resolution has made a major leap forward in the early xxth century with sundman s work but unfortunately the serial expression of the solution converges so slowly that it is of little use for computational purpose 7 1 the roche model 131 7 1 3 trajectories numerical solutions we limit our analysis to the motion in the orbital plane the roche potential now serves as a background to investigate the possible trajectories followed by a test mass launched from any initial position r 0 x y with the initial speed v 0 the equation of motion for the test mass once projected is now given by x v x 2 y y v y 2 x 7 7 this set of non linear coupled equations can be integrated using a 4 th order runge kutta 10 or a symplectic integrator a mathematica applet has been developed in association with 3 d printed roche potentials 11 to illustrate the profusion of trajectories one can obtain in the orbital plane from this very simple model the lagrangian points the roche potential has 5 equilibrium points the lagrangian points along the line joining the two bodies y 0 it can be shown that there are 3 equilibrium points one between the two bodies l 1 and one on each side l 2 and l 3 once the appropriate change of variables are made in 7 7 it can also be shown that this system admits two lateral points of equilibrium l 4 and l 5 those 5 points have been represented in figure 7 3 l 4 and l 5 are maxima of potential while l 1 l 2 and l 3 are saddle points the equilibrium study of those points requires the proper consideration of the coriolis force the linearly perturbed expression of 7 7 around the equilibrium points leads to coupled systems of equations whose jacobian contains the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of the problem 12 the latter provide information on the shape and pe riod of the linearly perturbed orbits sign considerations of the eigenvalues for l 1 l 2 and l 3 show that they are unstable equilibria but l 4 and l 5 turn out to be stable actually a whole arch from a point to another is stable and admits confined trajectories the horseshoe orbits this statement led people to consider the possibility to form and maintain a circumbinary ring of matter in common envelope symbiotic binaries the quasi dynamical mass transfer described in podsiadlowski 2014 an important feature to keep in mind and illustrated by the applet mentioned above since the system is hamiltonian the mechanical energy of the test mass is conserved in other words the isopotentials are also isovelocity curves thus if a test mass is left within a roche lobe where the isopotentials are closed around lower potential regions with an initial velocity too low to exit the roche lobe i e with an initial kinetic energy below the absolute value of the potential at the first lagrangian point the test mass is trapped within its roche lobe the singular case where a test mass is left at the first lagrangian point with a negligible velocity will be the guideline of the incoming discussion on roche lobe overflow on the contrary if a test mass has or acquires see previous chapter an initial velocity large enough it can not remain bounded to the system and will necessarily run away in case of a flow shocks can dissipate energy and modify this analysis 10 since the mechanical energy of the test mass is conserved in this non dissipative problem it can be used as a probe to evaluate the accuracy of the numerical integration see the famous lotka volterra prey predator model for a very similar mathematical and numerical framework where a first integral of the motion can also be determined 11 those two models for a mass ratio of 1 and 10 have been printed thanks to a 3 d printer funded by the r gion ile de

material and marco agnan was responsible for the technical support and realization 12 murray and dermott 1999 provides more details about this computation but see strogatz and shafer 1995 for a pedagogical introduction to this kind of analysis with the figure a 2 in murray 2002 as a crystal clear summary http demonstrations wolfram com trajectoryofatestmassinarochepotential 132 chapter 7 binary systems figure 7 5 the red filled squares are the computed distances from the stellar center to the first lagrangian point d 1 l 1 as a function of the mass ratio 1 indexing the star and 2 the compact object they have been computed with a newton raphson algortihm which provided results such as the relation at stake matched with a relative precision of 10 10 the green discs stand for the radius of the roche lobe according to eggleton s formula 7 8 while the blue circles around them are monte carlo computed radii of the roche lobe the two sets match within less than a percent the red empty squares and the green empty circles are the corresponding values for the accreting body all quantities have been normalized to the orbital separation 7 1 4 the spatially extended star in the ideal roche potential in this section unless explicitly stated the tidal forces are supposed to have fully circularized the orbits and brought the stellar component we consider into sychronous co rotation see 7 3 the roche lobes the first lagrangian point l 1 belongs to a critical 8 shaped isopotential which splits the inner region in two closed sections the roche lobes we define the radius of the roche lobe on the side of the body i rr i as the radius of the sphere with the corresponding volume due to the aforementioned exclusive dependence of the roche potential shape on q when the orbital separation a is used as a length scale we already know that the function e rr i a depends only on the mass ratio the expression of e is unknown but can be approximated to better than 1 over the whole range of q values with eggleton 1983 e q 0 49 q 2 3 0 6 q 2 3 ln 1 q 1 3 7 8 this function along with the normalized distance of the stellar center to the first lagrangian point has been represented in figure 7 5 for the range of mass ratios we will focus on in this work the reader might find an equivalent figure spanning several orders of magnitude in q in figure 1 of tout and hall 1991 when one has to account for non synchronous stellar rotation see avni 1976 for a modified formula an extension of this expression has also been suggested to account for the radiation pressure which lowers the effective gravity of high luminosity stars dermine et al 2009 7 1 the roche model 133 figure 7 6 three aspect ratios 1 in red 2 in green and 3 in blue quantifying the departure of the stellar surface from the spherical shape as the filling factor rises with 1 as upper value the vertical extension of each curve represents the range of value for an aspect ratio within the range we consider i e from 7 to 18 with 7 corresponding to the lower bound of the red stripe and to the upper bounds of the blue and green ones the hydrostatic roche problem in order to explain the departure of the stellar surface from spherical shape we write the hydrostatic equiv alent of 7 2 0 1 p r 7 9 where the first r h s term is the pressure force and the velocity of the flow is zero since the flow is hydro static within the co rotating frame which presupposes synchronous rotation see section 7 3 according to this equation isobares which define the fluid extension and by then the stellar extension coincide with isopotentials any closed contour delimiting a domain of lower potential are possible stellar surfaces and vice versa the filling factor the filling factor f is then the ratio of the radius of the star by the one of its roche lobe f r 1 ae q 7 10 it will be a key dimensionless quantity later on to study the motion of the wind at the orbital scale already an interesting feature is the deformation of the stellar surface with respect to the spherical shape one expects in the case of an isolated non rotating star since the isopotentials are not spherically shaped we quantify it by introducing three aspect ratios 1 2 and 3 computed as follow for 1 we evaluate the potential at the point x 1 r 1 0 with x 1 the position of the star with respect to the center of mass with x 1 0 and r 1 the stellar radius we then look along the x axis for the 2 points within the stellar roche lobe with the same potential using a newton raphson solver since the extension of the sphere of radius r 1 along the y axis is always enclosed within the roche lobe even for large filling factors those 2 points always exist the ratio of twice the stellar radius by the distance between those two points gives 1 it 134 chapter 7 binary systems figure 7 7 folded bolometric light curve of koi for kepler object of interest 1224 at the orbital period of approximately 2 7 days black dots the out of eclipse behavior of this short period system hosting a distorted low mass star orbited by a hot white dwarf displays a clear enhancement of the luminosity the ellipsoidal light variation it marks the non sphericity of the stellar surface in this waveband the star is approximately 25 times more luminous than its compact companion from breton et al 2012 represents the egg shape deformation of the isopotentials in the orbital plane since the extension of the sphere of radius r 1 along the z axis can go beyond the roche lobe for large filling factors we can no longer rely on the same method to directly compare the extensions along the z and x axis consequently we first compare the extensions along the y and z axis using the same method as above but looking for a point along the z axis passing through the stellar center instead of the x axis the ratio of this coordinate by the stellar radius provides 2 eventually 3 which compares the extensions along the x and z axis is obtained by the ratio of 2 and 1 all of them are below one and are represented in figure 7 6 in red blue and green in the order of rising index as a function of the filling factor and the mass ratio such an egg shape deformation entails a variation in the light observed from the system due to the enlarged cross section 13 when the system is in quadrature with respect to the eclipsing or transiting configuration 14 figure 7 7 another classical observational feature of close in binaries is the doppler beaming when the star approaches and fainting when it recedes of the stellar light due to the special relativistic light aberration a k a doppler boosting figure 7 8 in the case of high luminosity ratios of the two bodies within a given waveband the instrumental precision we now reach in some ranges opens the door to photometric measures of radial velocity 7 2 mass transfer the need for a theory of mass transfer in binary systems was first triggered by the puzzling observation of the algol binary 15 a k a persei an eclipsing system historically called the demon star due to its light variability algol consists of a 3 7 m main sequence star and a 0 8 m red giant according to the theory of stellar evolution the more massive a star the faster its evolution but the red giant stage comes after the main sequence the algol paradox can be resolved provided we account for a possible mass transfer in the past which brings up the burning question of the specificities of stellar evolution when they are not isolated to better appreciate the role played by mass transfer we now describe it in more details from its triggering to the different regimes we must expect with a special emphasis on the case where the accretor 13 strictly speaking to quantify this effect one also wants to account for the non uniform temperature distribution at the surface with a colder photosphere further away from the stellar center 14 see wilson 1994 for three dimensional representations of the stellar surface at different orbital phases 15 it is actually a hierarchical triple system 7 2 mass transfer 135 figure 7 8 folded bolometric light curve of koi 74 at the orbital period of approximately 5 2 days blue dots the out of eclipse behaviour not only displays the ellipsoidal light variation at twice the orbital frequency but also an asymmetry between the light enhancement before and after the primary eclipse this additional light is to be understood as the doppler beaming of the stellar light due to the special relativistic geometrical doppler effect a k a doppler boosting in this waveband the star is expected to be 500 times more luminous than its white dwarf companion from van kerkwijk et al 2010 is a compact object to keep things simple we assume that the two bodies are on circular orbits and remain so as matter is transferred see section 7 3 1 for a discussion of circularisation in binary systems 7 2 1 secular evolution of the filling factor through this section we study the reasons which can lead an initially detached binary system 16 to be come the stage of a mass transfer according to 7 10 it takes either an expansion of the stellar radius or a shrinking of the orbital separation the eggleton factor being essentially constant for slow changes of the mass ratio which will thus be considered as constant in this section as a consequence of the instability of the first lagrangian point midway between the two bodies mass transfer will take place once the filling factor reaches unity this regime of mass transfer is called roche lobe overflow rlof but keep in mind that it tells something about the geometry of the star relatively to its roche lobe more than about the mass transfer per se 17 the proper treatment of the growth of the stellar radius as times flow on secular scales require sophis ticated models out of the scope of the present manuscript 18 let us first frame a binary system hosting two roche lobe underfilling stars and whose orbital period would be constant as the stars evolve their radii grow such as the filling factor of e g the star indexed 1 and called the primary can reach unity if it happens stellar matter gets close enough from the first lagrangian point to leak into the roche lobe of the secondary star section 7 2 3 we will see in the next section 7 2 2 that this regime can be stable if the mass of the donor is lower than the one of the accretor usually a neutron star in the supergiant x ray binaries we will focus on in the next chapter the filling factor can also reach unity due to a shrinking of the orbital separation and not to the evo lution of the stellar radius on the corbet diagram of figure 2 4 one of the systems represented 4 u 2206 543 hosts a main sequence star in absence of rlof mass transfer we will mention in the next 16 i e two bodies underfilling their roche lobes that is to say their filling factors are below 1 17 see section 8 4 1 where roche lobe underfilling supergiant stars can transfer mass in a way which is a reminiscent of rlof the stream dominated regime 18 the mesa code provides a very comprehensive toolkits to handle stellar evolution it has become the main scientific stellar evolution code and its proactive community brings maintenance collaborative improvements and technical scientific support a web base interface also exists for immediate hands on use http mesa sourceforge net http mesa web asu edu 136 chapter 7 binary systems section how the orbital separation can still shrink as angular momentum is lost 7 2 2 stability of the mass transfer the reader will find a comprehensive and detailed discussion of the secular evolution of x ray binaries in the review by van den heuvel 2009 we remind here the main results which lead to two separated populations of x ray binaries to do so we first investigate the stability of the mass transfer and then go on to deduce the main evolutionary tracks which drives a binary system into emitting large amount of x rays conservative mass transfer the archetype of the conservative mass transfer is the rlof described in section 7 2 3 the mass lost by the donor 1 with a rate m 1 0 is entirely captured by the accretor 2 the angular momentum l of the system composed of the two orbiting bodies in the inertial frame is given by l lorb 1 lorb 2 m 1 m 2 p ga m 1 m 2 lspin 1 l spin 2 7 11 where orb refers to the orbital angular momentum whose magnitude has been expressed while spin refers to the self rotation of the two bodies if we neglect the latter ones 19 we can write the conservation of the total mass and angular momentum of the system and get the rate of change of the orbital separation see e g d souza et al 2005 and references therein for more details a a 2 l l 2 m 1 m 1 1 q 7 12 where the loss of angular momentum l 0 of the system can be due to stellar winds or magnetic torques 20 schatzman 1962 during a stage of significant conservative mass transfer between the two bodies such as a rlof the change in the orbital separation due to the loss of angular momentum can be neglected in this case this expression shows that a transfer of matter from the lighter component to the heavier body q 1 results on secular time scales in a widening of the orbital separation if the transfer of matter occurs from the heavier to the lighter component q 1 the orbital separation shrinks until possibly the mass ratio goes below 1 the local relation above can be integrated to get the analytical net change of the orbital separation for a given set of initial and final masses we can then differentiate 7 8 to get the rate of change of the radius of the roche lobe as a function of q m 1 and m 1 on the other hand the rate of change of the donor radius can also be deduced provided a mass radius relation 21 by comparing the evolution of the roche lobe and stellar radius as the mass is transferred we can distinguish two main regimes 1 either the filling factor lowers as the mass transfer happens this negative feedback loop guarantees a slow evolution since mass is supplied on a rate controlled by the secular expansion of the donor 2 or the filling factor which was already of the order of unity gets higher as the mass is transferred and then the system evolves on the short timescale associated to the stellar equilibrium 19 for a star in synchronous rotation it can be justified by the small stellar radius compared to the orbital separation this ratio being squared the neutron star rotates much faster than its orbital speed but with a spin period larger than the millisecond and nominal parameters of a sgxb one can easily show that its spin angular momentum can also be neglected compared to its orbital one mostly due to its tiny size 20 or to an emission of gravitational waves significant for short period compact binaries such as the historical psr 1913 16 21 the classical polytrope model suggests different values for n d logr d log m depending on the dominant physical pro cesses at stake for instance 0 5 to 1 for a high radiative envelope to low convective envelope mass star on the main sequence and 1 3 for an evolved fully convective star 7 2 mass transfer 137 one can derive a critical value of the mass ratio q 0 function of the polytropic index of the donor of its mass and of its mass loss rate 22 which sets a threshold between those two regimes for values of q below resp above q 0 the mass transfer is stable resp unstable the exact value of q 0 depends on the model but is of the order of 1 a first conclusion we can draw from this analysis is that large mass ratio systems are not likely to be observed in a rlof configuration given the instability of the mass transfer such a system would quickly find itself in a common envelope phase 23 unless the mass ratio reaches q 0 before the secondary compo nent fills its own roche lobe consequently in an x ray binary hosting a low mass accretor with respect to the donor mass any extended stellar atmosphere probably present around large eddington factor stars such as blue luminous variables hypergiant or wolf rayet stars is likely to be quickly transferred to the accretor in x ray binaries where the large x ray luminosity points towards a rlof mass transfer and an accreting compact object of mass generally larger than one solar mass it means that the stellar compan ion is of low mass it is the case of lmxb we do not expect proper rlof mass transfer for high mass star orbited by a neutron star the few systems which have been observed in a rlof like regime while their mass ratio is likely larger than unity have been described in section 2 1 5 common envelope for common envelope systems 24 the stellar matter fills the whole space below the lowest isopotential between the second and the third lagrangian point this phase brings up the question of the legitimacy of the point mass assumption for the star indeed the gravitational field we considered in section 7 1 is only accurate outside the star i e in any point such as a sphere with the stellar center as an origin and which does not intersect the surface can be drawn indeed the green ostrogradsky theorem coupled to the poisson equation to derive the gravitational field from the mass distribution 25 guarantees the right to replace the spatially extended mass distribution with a weighted dirac distribution in systems in a common envelope configuration self gravity must be properly included to represent the dynamics of the system birth of an x ray binary in a binary where both stars underflow their roche lobe mass transfer can be triggered its fate depends mostly on its initial orbital period and stellar masses along with the kind of mass transfers at stake con servative or not it also depends on whether the envelope of the donor is convective or radiative when the mass transfer starts the different scenarii are described in detail in the compendious references verbunt and van den heuvel 1995 and van den heuvel 2009 see in particular figure 10 and the 3 cases a b and c though as long as none of the two bodies has collapsed into a compact object the mass transfer will go unnoticed in x rays a first scenario accounts for the lmxb in brief it involves a high mass ratio system where the less mas sive body is quickly engulfed into the envelope of its massive companion as the latter evolves it leads to a dramatic reduction of the orbital separation and provided the binary survives the supernova explosion associated to the formation of the compact object 26 to a stable rlof transfer of matter from the bullied low mass star to the freshly formed compact remnant a lmxb is born during this process the low mass star has not necessarily evolved enough to leave the main sequence concerning the hmxb two main scenarii account for the two main observed families see section 2 1 2 for a description of their observational properties the sgxb and the be xb in both cases the initial mass 22 and of the orbital angular momentum and its loss rate if it has not been neglected 23 this scenario is favoured if the donor has a convective envelope at the onset of the mass transfer it possibly leads to the formation of the spectacular albeit speculative thorne z ytkow objects thorne and zytkow 1977 24 also called contact binaries for stellar binaries with w ursae majoris as the observational reference 25 which becomes the einstein equation in a general relativistic framework 26 see also section 2 2 1 on the possible formation of runaway compact objects 138 chapter 7 binary systems figure 7 9 a scenario with the successive stages to account for the formation of sgxb the stellar masses are indicated and the vertical dashed line traces the position of the center of mass from van den heuvel 2009 of each star is above 8 m but the progenitors of sgxb start with somewhat larger masses for the two stars as depicted on the first sketch of figure 7 9 as the more massive star evolves it fills its roche lobe and due to the unstable rlof quickly transfers its envelope to its companion which becomes more massive the naked helium core keeps evolving not much affected by the absence of its erstwhile envelope and collapses into a neutron star later on the remaining massive star in spite of the initial rejuvenating stage is on its last legs it has become a supergiant and displays strong radiatively driven winds a fraction of it is captured by its compact companion a sgxb is born most of the difference in the evolution of be and sgxb lies in the initial masses at stake and the fraction of the mass deposited in the helium core since only the envelope surrounding the core will be lost in case of unstable rlof it implies different amounts of mass being transferred and by then a different evolution of the orbital separation van den heuvel 2009 suggests an empirical relation between the initial stellar mass and the mass of the helium core which once injected in the integrated expression of 7 12 for rlof i e without loss of angular momentum gives the final period pf after the envelope has been given away to the secondary star as a function of the initial one pini pf 100 pini m 1 ini 13 m 1 3 1 qini 1 29 m 1 ini 14 m 0 42 3 7 13 where qini is the initial mass ratio and m 1 ini is the initial mass of the donor the term at the denomi nator ranges from 15 to 50 for increasing mass ratios and initial mass of the donor from 1 5 10 m to 2 5 20 m the first configuration corresponds more to the progenitors of be xb while the second is for the ones of sgxb thus we expect orbital periods at the moment when the helium core is unveiled a few 7 2 mass transfer 139 figure 7 10 a scenario with the successive stages to account for the formation of bexb the stellar masses are indicated and the vertical line traces the position of the center of mass from van den heuvel 2009 times larger for the progenitors of be xb compared to the ones of sgxb according to the distribution of orbital periods of the two groups see the corbet diagram in figure 2 4 this trend seems to be preserved as the system evolves because the orbital separation is wider the angular momentum provided to the stellar accretor during the first phase of rlof is larger the secondary star is accelerated as it accretes the envelope of its com panion and reaches spins of the order of the disruption limit 27 an excretion disk forms around the newly formed be star and will be tapped by the compact object once formed see figure 2 3 the scarcity of intermediate mass x ray binaries the observed distribution of stellar companion masses is bimodal hence the two separated families of x ray binary systems lmxb and hmxb with generally different kinds of mass transfer if rlof is triggered in a hmxb hosting a neutron star we have seen that the system is doomed it will evolve towards a common envelope system on a short radiative timescale let us consider the evolution of a system initially alike the progenitor of the lmxb we considered in the previous section 7 2 2 but where the mass ratio is lower such as the secondary star is of a few solar masses in this case it s easier for the intermediate mass star to eject the common envelope of the primary which collapsed into a neutron star the secondary is not massive enough to display strong winds it does not form a sgxb and once rlof mass transfer starts it finds itself in the unstable regime see the 27 by balancing the gravitation and the centrifugal force at the equator one gets the following minimum spin period for a star of mass m and radius r below which the outer layers are no longer bounded 1 5 day r 15 r 3 2 m 20 m 1 2 140 chapter 7 binary systems figure 7 11 evolution of 38 000 binary systems uniformly sampled with a mass of the donor and orbital period within the red frame the colormap indicates the accumulated time spent in each pixel by all the binaries from 103 years purple to 1010 years red shortly few systems are left with a mass of the donor above 1 m from lin et al 2011 purple u shaped beyond 1 m in figure 1 of lin et al 2011 the low mass neutron star is not able to accommodate the super eddington incoming accretion flow most of the mass is quickly lost from the binary the mass transfer slows down once the mass ratio is below one and the secondary star is now a low mass companion it is therefore possible that most of the currently observed donors in lmxb started their evolution as intermediate mass stars the reader may find more information on this intermediate mass x ray binaries desert in podsiadlowski 2014 see also king and ritter 1999 and podsiadlowski and rappaport 2000 for an application to the case of cyg x 2 7 2 3 roche lobe overflow in this part we evaluate the x ray luminosity produced by this configuration when the accretor is a com pact object and question the existence of an accretion disk mass accretion rate the reader might find a detailed semi analytical ballistic model to describe in more details the formation of the stream flowing through the first lagrangian point in lubow and shu 1975 in the rlof configuration the stellar donor is strongly distorted and starts to pour matter into the roche lobe of its companion 28 the mechanical specific energy of the gas on the edge of the first la grangian point is given by the roche potential and the thermal specific energy at the stellar surface with the latter being negligible then according to the final remark of section 7 1 3 the flow is likely to be 28 when one of the two bodies fills its roche lobe the system is said to be semi detached 7 2 mass transfer 141 figure 7 12 ballistic trajectories of test masses left at the first lagrangian point with kinetic specific ener gies negligible compared to the absolute roche potential at l 1 the roche lobe represented is the one of the accretor from flannery 1975 trapped within the roche lobe of the companion especially if the latter is more massive 29 the dimen sionless 30 width of the nozzle which forms at the first lagrangian point can be estimated by comparing this thermal specific energy to an expansion of the roche potential along the y transverse axis in l 1 r r l 1 1 2 q 1 x 3 l 1 x 3 l 1 1 x 3 l 2 x 3 l 2 y 2 7 14 where y is the small dimensionless displacement in the y direction xl i stands for the dimensionless distance of the center i to the first lagrangian point since we are interested in an estimate of the mass accretion rate we did not consider in the expression above the expansion along the z transverse axis because the net restoring gravitational force due to a departure from l 1 is partly compensated by the increase in the outwards centrifugal force along the y direction but not along the z one the cross section of the flow flowing through the first lagrangian point will be ellipsoidal flattened in the z direction with the ratio of the second order derivatives of the potential along the two directions giving the aspect ratio from now on we neglect this flattening and rely on the expansion along the y direction only a usual approximated expression found in the literature see e g frank et al 2002 gives xl i 0 5 0 227 log qi with i 1 2 7 15 with qi mi mj with j 6 i xl 1 xl 2 1 7 16 29 in this case the ratio of the potentials at l 1 and at the lagrangian point behind the companion is larger which leaves less room to a leakage through the latter point 30 with the orbital separation a and 0 gm 2 a as references for the length and the potential homogeneous to a squared velocity 142 chapter 7 binary systems within the range of mass ratios we consider this factor which is the one in front of y 2 above is of the order of 3 1 q the flow is able to overcome the potential barrier around l 1 provided its specific thermal energy is higher than the additional amount of potential compared to r l 1 due to the extension of the nozzle along the y axis 3 1 q 2 c 2 s 2 7 17 where cs is the sound speed the mindful reader will have noticed at this point that is essentially the small parameter lubow and shu 1975 based their analysis on the mass outflow through the first lagrangian point is then given by in physical units m 1 2 cs c 3 s 6 2 10 8 m yr 10 7 g cm 3 p 10 hr 2 cs 7 km s 1 3 7 18 where m 1 0 is the mass density at the first lagrangian point and we used kepler s third law classical values for low mass evolved stars 31 have been used those mass accretion rates are much higher than the ones we can derive from wind accretion considerations as we will see let us now study the fate of this stream dominated flow the accretion disk onc can show that the thermal specific energy is much smaller than the absolute potential at the first la grangian point which means that the flow quickly acquires a supersonic velocity in the co rotating frame as it flows in this way the ballistic preliminary work we realized in the previous section can be summoned and applied to draw the streamlines the angular momentum in the co rotating frame initially rises due to the coriolis force 32 which accounts for the deviation of the streamline with a zero initial transverse ve locity in figure 7 12 particles are then doomed to travel within the roche lobe and the trajectories which depend weakly on the initial conditions quickly cross which breaks up the ballistic approximation 33 dis sipative effects come into play and the flow arranges so as to minimize its energy since the potential is approximately isotropic once the flow comes into the roche lobe of the accretor after the first phase of addition of angular momentum by the coriolis force the angular momentum with respect to the accretor is essentially conserved and the flow forms a ring 34 of radius rc the circularization radius if one neglects the angular momentum change induced by the combined action of the two gravitational forces from l 1 to the circular orbit we can find rc by noting that the coriolis force vanishes in a frame which would not be co rotating and where the system would rotate at its orbital angular speed then the specific angular momentum with respect to the accretor in l 1 would be given by d 2 2 l 1 where d 2 l 1 is the distance from the accretor center to the first lagrangian point by definition of the circularization radius around the secondary body i e the accretor gm 2 r 2 c d 22 l 1 2 r 3 c 7 19 according to figure 7 5 seen from the point of view of the secondary object d 2 l 1 is slightly larger than the radius of the roche lobe by a factor we write 1 we then have using kepler s third law rc a 1 a 2 gm 2 1 ae 1 q d 2 l 1 4 1 4 1 q e 4 1 q 7 20 31 the mass density in the photosphere is lower than the mean density and the mean density drops quickly as a star evolves the sun sets an order of magnitude for the initial value of this mean density on the main sequence with 1 4 g cm 3 32 and to a lesser extent to the combined action of the two gravitational forces 33 a necessary condition to be ballistic for a flow is to be incompressible not too be confused with an incompressible fluid yet a flow is said to be incompressible if and only if its lagrangian derivative is 0 i e v 0 and matter is conserved as for the magnetic field in terms of field lines it means that the streamlines do not cross if they do the flow is no longer incompressible and a proper hydrodynamical treatment must be carried out 34 it is the orbit which minimizes the energy at a constant angular momentum 7 3 tidal interactions 143 this ratio shows that for realistic orbital separations and for compact accretors white dwarfs included the circular orbit will be well above the surface 35 due to viscous effects we will not detail in this manuscript the ring spreads into a disk see the section 5 2 of frank et al 2002 for instance where matter spirals in towards the accretor as it does gravitational energy is converted into heat which is radiated away following shakura and sunyaev s multi color black body disk model shakura and sunyaev 1973 as detailed in 1 2 2 if the efficiency of this conversion is of the order of 10 36 the corresponding x ray luminosity for the nominal mass accretion rate computed in the previous section is lx 0 1 m 1 c 2 6 1037 erg s 1 7 21 we will see in the next chapter that this luminosity is an order of magnitude above the very upper edge of the range of luminosities expected for a wind accretion mechanism as a consequence observers tend to infer the presence of a disk from an x ray luminosity above 1037 erg s 1 in many intrinsically obscured systems such as sgxb the emission is strongly absorbed in the soft x rays where the disk emits most of its light its direct observation is unthinkable it is also an energy range strongly absorbed by the interstellar medium 7 3 tidal interactions evidence for circulatization in stellar binaries have been witnessed in spectroscopic and eclipsing binaries the former observed sample is short of early type binaries 37 and is mostly made of stars with convective envelopes since we are interested in the evolution of the progenitors of sgxb we will only focus on the case of stars hosting a convective core surrounded by a radiative envelope i e observationally speaking on the eclipsing binaries 7 3 1 theoretical arguments in favour of circularized orbits following zahn s seminal papers on tidal interactions in binaries zahn 1975 1977 claret and gimenez 1997 suggested an expression eq 18 for the circularization 38 timescale circ of a stellar orbit in a binary system normalized by the stellar lifetime for high mass stars 39 0 2 25 m m 3 daigne 2015 we see that this circularization timescale is given by circ 0 q 1 1 q 11 6 1 for q 0 5 10 6 e 2 m 15 m 5 2 r 14 r 3 2 1 3 r 21 2 10 gyr 0 7 22 where 0 is the lifetime of the sun m and r are the mass and stellar radius respectively and q is the ratio of the mass of the star we are focusing on by the mass of the companion the structural parameter e 2 can be computed and is of the order of 10 6 claret and gimenez 1997 this expression shows that the relative speed at which a stellar orbit circularizes in a binary system depends mostly on a key quantity the fractional radius r which is the ratio of the stellar radius by the orbital separation provided it is large enough the circularization of the orbit will occur on a timescale smaller than the stellar lifetime see figure 7 13 given the strong dependency we expect a cutoff a quick 35 which is not necessary the case if the accretor is a star see raymer 2012 for numerical simulations of rlof in short period algols 36 it is an estimate of the product of the compactness of the accretor by an efficiency factor which evaluates the fraction of the gravitational potential energy which is released as free radiation 37 early type stars have few spectral lines in their spectra 38 not to be confused with the circularization radius of an accreted flow 39 beyond 1 5 m approximately those with a radiative envelope 144 chapter 7 binary systems figure 7 13 ratio of the circularization timescale by the stellar lifetime for stars with radiative envelopes as a function of the fractional radius the blue continuous line is for a 15 m star with a radius of 10 r and the red dashed line corresponds to a 8 m star with a radius of 6 r below the horizontal thick black line the orbit can be circularized within the stellar lifetime we set e 2 10 6 and q 2 i e the star whose orbit is being circularized is twice as massive as the companion typically the initial situations of figure 7 9 and 7 10 drop in the eccentricity measured for fractional radii below a threshold 40 in figure 7 13 we see that for different types of massive stars the circularization is possible within the stellar lifetime for fractional radii above 0 25 above 1 3 it takes less than 10 of the stellar lifetime to circularize 7 3 2 confrontation to observations recent observational analysis mazeh 2008 van eylen et al 2016 have undergone measures of this threshold relying on lowly biased samples such as eclipsing binaries due to the unknown value of the longitude at periastron the eccentricity itself cannot be accessed directly from the analysis of the light curves observers need to introduce an additional layer of assumptions to deduce the eccentricity from the value of e cos determined from the phase of the secondary eclipse relative to the primary van eylen et al 2016 however since we only look for a threshold in fractional radius below which the eccentricity is essentially zero plotting e cos instead of e will not alter the value of the threshold 41 north and zahn 2004 concerning the fractional radius it can be straightforwardly measured in eclipsing binaries using con siderations on t the duration between the first and last time of dimming of the light and t t the duration of the total eclipse when the foreground star is entirely within the disk of the background star if one of the two eclipses admits a total eclipse one can show that see figure 7 14 e g when star 2 passes 40 different thresholds are expected depending on the structure of the envelope eccentric orbits in between could then be con clusively considered to be associated to a star with a convective envelope 41 beyond the threshold we just expect the distribution of eccentricities to be modulated by the cosine of a uniform distribution angle 7 3 tidal interactions 145 figure 7 14 illustration of the evolution of the brightness as a star transits its larger companion credits nasa ames in front of star 1 t r 1 r 2 a p t r 1 a p 7 23 where p is the orbital period precisely measured 42 using a high photometric precision instrument such as kepler enables us to measure with incredible levels of precision those time lapses and by then the corresponding fractional radii of the two bodies without any additional assumption on their masses for instance plotting e cos as a function of r is then possible in figure 7 15 the threshold deduced from this figure 0 25 is slightly lower than the one predicted in the previous section 1 3 a mass ratio of 1 or later type stars than the o stars more rare considered above are enough to correct this discrepancy then we can safely assume that short period stellar binaries hosting early type stars are circularized what about their offspring x ray binaries since bexb progenitors host lower masses objects than the progenitors of sgxb the orbital separations involved are larger see 7 2 2 hence the orbit is less likely to be circularized be that as it may due to the strong non conservation of the mass of the system when the supernova explosion takes place the orbit will be highly altered 43 in addition we expect the explosion to be non spherical such as the neutron star is left with a kick velocity tauris and van den heuvel 2003 those two effects statistically contribute to rise the eccentricity of the orbit of the freshly formed compact object see tauris and takens 1998 for detailed calculations however the quantification of those effects show that they will have fewer impacts all other things equal for lower ratios of the kick velocity with respect to the orbital speed since the progenitors of sgxb host more massive stars on closer orbits we can then suggest a first explanation about the bimodal distribution in eccentricity between sgxb and bexb the combined evolution of the phase preceding the supernova explosion and the way the system reacts to the latter makes sgxb much less eccentric than bexb in the next chapter we can then afford to consider the sgxb we study as fully circularized 42 an uncertainty we neglect in this equality is the curvature of the orbit as the fractional radius shrinks it becomes more impor tant but remains largely negligible 43 going through the computation suggests that the binary is disrupted by the explosion if it occurs in the more massive of the two objects making an additional case for preliminary mass transfer see 7 2 2 146 chapter 7 binary systems figure 7 15 value of the product of the eccentricity by the cosine of the longitude at periastron as a function of the fractional radius sample of detached eclipsing binary systems from small magellanic cloud data from udalski et al 1998 from north and zahn 2004 7 3 3 synchronization the theory of tidal evolution predicts synchronization timescales smaller than circularization timescales

1 1 the inspiring precedents of agb donors barium stars a k a ba stars are population 1 iii g and k spectral type giants displaying excesses of bar ium 2 carbon and s process elements 3 in general compared to usual red giants indeed they are not massive enough below 5 m to reach the asymptotic giant branch agb where they would have been able to produce heavy elements subsequently brought to the surface by third dredge up iben and ren zini 1983 ba stars build up the main fraction of a wider family the carbon enhanced metal poor stars cemp stars where we observe c fe 1 see beers and christlieb 2005 and masseron et al 2009 for a more detailed review of the different kinds of cemp stars those objects have turned out to have oscillating radial velocity profiles in agreement with the presence of a white dwarf companion lucatello et al 2005 suggesting an enrichment by mass transfer rather than intrinsic scenarii the progenitor of the white dwarf can have been an agb whose massive stellar wind enabled it to loose enough mass to escape the supernova ending gawryszczak et al 2002 producing spectacular planetary and proto planetary nebu lae the less massive progenitor of the ba star would have then accreted a fraction of this metal enriched wind 4 the evaluation of this fraction is one of the key quantities to assess the viability of this scenario symbiotic binaries consist of an agb or a red giant star and a hot accreting companion usually a white dwarf the orbital period lies between hundreds of days and a hundreds of years the white dwarf taps the wind of its companion whose mass loss rates m out ranges from 10 8 to 10 6 m yr 1 a first approach could be to model the incoming wind onto the white dwarf with a planar supersonic flow at a velocity v of a few 10 km s 1 the usual terminal velocity for red giant winds without taking into account the orbital speed 5 the non spherical dilution of the wind or the eccentricity of the orbit the bhl theory reminded in chapter 4 would yield a fraction of stellar wind being accreted of the order of m m out 14 hl a 2 gm v 2 a 2 8 1 with m the mass of the white dwarf and a the orbital separation once estimated the 10 efficiency associated accretion luminosity l for a system where the agb star is twice heavier than the white dwarf is l 0 1 m out c 2 100 l v 40 km s 1 4 m 0 5 m 4 3 p 104 days 4 3 m out 10 7 m s 1 8 2 which is more than an order of magnitude too low to account for the observed luminosity but also for the metal enrichment problem in cemp stars boffin and zacs 1994 a more sophisticated approach which includes the orbital velocity and accounts for the eccentricity 6 can be found in boffin and jorissen 1988 and was used by abate et al 2013 in symbiotic binaries they concluded that larger accretion fractions than the ones given by the formulae above could be reached once two additional aspects widely explored by mohamed 2010 were taken into account in a mass transfer regime called wind rlof 1 the fact that the wind is not instantaneously accelerated but on the contrary admits a finite charac teristic acceleration length scale which can be larger than the roche lobe of the donor star or even larger than the orbital separation 1 the stars in the milky way are separated between population iii the very first generation relics of the early stage of stellar formation in our galaxy with very low metallicity levels ii late type stars intermediate metallicity levels and dispersed around the galactic plane and i early type stars high metallicity and gathered in the spiral arms 2 above a threshold of ba fe log nba nba nfe nfe 0 5 where nx refers to the number density of element x and refers to the values measured for the sun 3 for slow neutron capture 4 contrary to what initially suggested mcclure 1983 the photosphere of the agb does not need to fill its roche lobe during this phase to make the mass transfer effective enough in those long period a few thousands days systems 5 which is of the same order at most not changing too much this result 6 although it does consider v 0 v 8 1 modelling wind accretion 149 2 the related fact that the wind can be highly non spherical but beamed towards the accretor many different semi analytical approaches and several numerical setups have been developed to address this question among which theuns and jorissen 1993 theuns et al 1996 jahanara et al 2005 nagae et al 2005 de val borro et al 2009 huarte espinosa et al 2012 or blackman et al 2013 this idea of a possible enhancement of mass transfer once the launching of the wind was properly accounted for and the fruitful results it brought up drove us into adapting this model to persistent sgxb in section 8 4 2 note that the main difficulty for agb donors is that the launching mechanism 7 is much less well constrained than the launching of the wind of hot stars 8 1 2 mass accretion rates x ray luminosity using the bhl formalism in x ray binaries the spectral properties of the emission are very different as indicated by its name it emits most of its radiation in the x ray range 8 while the accreting white dwarfs of symbiotic binaries emit in a softer range typically uv light 9 this discrepancy reflects the higher compactness parameter of the accretors in x ray binaries which are mostly neutron stars and sometimes black holes 10 however the similar accretion luminosities can be explained by the formula 8 2 used with nominal values for sgxb and a similar efficiency for the conversion of potential energy into luminosity l 3 7 1035 erg s 1 v 1 000 km s 1 4 m 1 3 m 4 3 p 10 days 4 3 m out 10 6 m s 1 8 3 although this estimated luminosity is the same within a few percent as the one derived in the previous section for symbiotic binaries 11 the parameters it deals with are very different the wind speed when it reaches the accretor is much faster which contributes to significantly lower the accretion radius but the period is much smaller which almost compensates the previous drop and makes the angular size of the accretion radius as seen from the donor star similar this value lies on the lower end of the range of observed time median x ray luminosities in persistent sgxb see figure 8 1 there are two additional and somewhat more fundamental reasons why this approach can in no case be considered as satisfying first the theory of radiatively driven winds see chapter 6 predicts significant inhomogeneities due to internal shocks provoked by the intrinsic non linearity of the acceleration term see dessart and owocki 2005 for numerical simulations it means that overdense clumps with possibly lower velocities due to their larger inertia are present in the wind 12 the formula above indicates how sensitive the level of luminosity is to the kinetic energy of the flow it accretes which brings up a large possible spreading around this order of magnitude if not a shifted value ducci et al 2009 second the comparison with symbiotic binaries does not hold due to a strong scale non invariance of the problem the characteristic scale quantities do order in the same way e g for the length the accretion radius is smaller than the stellar radius which is smaller than the acceleration radius itself smaller than the orbital separation for usual values but the spatial scale dynamics in symbiotic binaries limited to a few tens at most can reach a few hundreds in sgxb between the smallest and the largest characteristic scale such an enlargement of the adimensioned flow numbers formed by ratio of the characteristic scales can have dramatic effects on the structure of the flow such as the well known triggering of turbulence for large reynolds numbers in other contexts as a consequence the actual structure of the flow and its time variability are likely to depart a lot from the results obtained for 7 believed to be initiated with pulsations which bring matter far enough to condensate and then being accelerated by radiation pressure on the subsequently formed dust grains h fner 2007 8 i e above a few 0 1 kev and below a few 100 kev 9 i e above a few ev and below a few 100 ev 10 note that the waverange of the emission also depends on the emitting environment being optically thin or thick see 1 2 2 11 no mysterious coincidence here the mass of the accretor has been tuned so that it guarantees this while still corresponding to a possible mass see e g the values measured in sgxb in figure 7 of clark et al 2002 or figure 12 of van der meer et al 2007 12 especially within two stellar radii where the neutron star usually lies 150 chapter 8 persistent sgxb agb donors in binary systems in particular concerning the likelihood of the formation of a wind capture disk jahanara et al 2005 de val borro et al 2009 huarte espinosa et al 2012 the wind velocity profile in those low eccentricity systems where the wind speed is much larger than the orbital one the afore mentioned formula by boffin and jorissen 1988 does little to solve the discrepancy if one keeps using the terminal speed of the wind more sophisticated attempts to account for the x ray luminosity observed rely on the actual velocity profile of the wind indeed when it reaches the close in neutron star it is still at a lower speed than the terminal one see also the upper panel of the figure 8 5 in section 8 2 3 it is com mon to fit the wind velocity profile with a formula inspired by 6 24 derived in chapter 6 the so called law lamers and cassinelli 1999 v r v 1 r r 8 4 where v is the measured terminal speed r is an estimate of the stellar radius 13 and is a quantification of the smoothness of the velocity profile believed to lie between 0 7 and 1 m ller and vink 2008 using this profile with 0 8 and a terminal speed of 1 000 km s 1 one can derive the velocity of the flow once it reaches the compact object at the orbital separation 14 this value can be used instead of the fiducial 1 000 km s 1 in 8 3 to compute a more realistic x ray luminosity in function of for instance the orbital period the latter no longer only set the orbital separation but take part in the estimate of the wind velocity when it reaches the accretor the orbital period when measured is extremely well known compared to the other quantities of the system which enables us to neglect the uncertainty on its value and motivates its use using formula 6 from boffin and jorissen 1988 a refinement where the orbital speed is also accounted for with the velocity to compute the accretion radius given by the wind profile 15 yielded the solid black curve and the filled blueish region around displayed in figure 8 1 overplotted is the domain of variation for a subset of sgxb we selected the persistent sgxb which have a measure of orbital period and a relatively precise measure of distance to derive the associated luminosity where both quantities are taken from 16 walter et al 2015 the range of x ray luminosities for 4 u 1700 37 4 u 1538 522 vela x 1 and oao 1657 415 is taken from walter et al 2015 for the other systems we enforced the same luminosity variation relatively to their median x ray luminosity which gives a total dynamic factor between the lowest and highest level of luminosity of approximately 100 consistent with their persistent sgxb nature what we observe is that apart from their values at low orbital period i e below 5 days when the under filling of the roche lobe becomes a strong constraint on the stellar radius the median x ray luminosities are also consistent with a non dependence with respect to the orbital period the spreading over sev eral orders of magnitude of the x ray luminosity can not be explained by the departure from circularity of the neutron star orbit since the eccentricity hardly reaches 0 2 in those systems the discrepancy which remains emphasizes the need for a self consistent framework where all the elements of the problem are coupled together for example where the terminal speed and the mass loss rate are not artificially set by hand but derived from the stellar properties and where the velocity profile unfolds itself in the roche potential of the two bodies in this way the predicted x ray luminosities will be able to self consistently handle the wobble around the black curve in figure 8 1 due to the mass loss rate the mass of the accretor the stellar mass the wind terminal speed the stellar radius etc 13 to enforce the velocity to match the speed of sound at the stellar surface r is usually multiplied by a coefficient slightly smaller than 1 see e g ducci et al 2009 14 or at the peri and apastron for a non circular orbit 15 evaluated at the the orbital separation or at the peri and apastron if the orbit is eccentricity 16 we also multiply the result by 3 to extrapolate the 17 to 60 kev fluxes given by walter et al 2015 to broadband x ray fluxes 8 1 modelling wind accretion 151 8 1 3 wind captured discs for the sake of simplicity we make a few additional assumptions with respect to the more realistic model presented in the next sections we follow the model introduced by shapiro and lightman 1976 to es timate the net angular momentum carried across the accretion cylinder face because of the variation of speed and density of the incident flow across its cross section first we consider that the mass ratio is large enough to make the star lie at the center of the inertial i e non corotating frame the low mass 17 accretor is on a circular orbit at vc around the star and captures wind material as it flows radially outwards from the star the matter is intercepted in a co orbiting tube the aforementioned accretion cylinder it is not aimed directly along the line joining the two bodies but pointed ahead of it by an angle due to the relative velocity vrel of the wind with respect to the compact object it is the latter which defines the main axis of the accretion cylinder tilted with respect to the radial direction by the angle given by arctan vc vw 8 5 where vw is the velocity of the wind at the orbital separation the configuration is represented in fig ure 8 2 we go on with a second assumption the accretion radius of the hatched cross section in fig ure 8 2 is small enough compared to the orbital separation and to the acceleration radius of the wind to figure 8 1 range of x ray luminosities observed for a sample of sgxb with overlaid an estimate of the x ray luminosity as a function of the period see text for more details we use a mass for the neutron star and the donor star of 1 4 m and 20 m respectively the stellar radius is set to 15 r the terminal speed to 1 000 km s 1 the velocity profile exponent to 0 8 and the mass loss rate to 10 6 m yr 1 the central thick black line corresponds to a circular orbit while the upper and lower case are the values at the peri and apastron respectively for an eccentricity of 0 2 17 typically not a bh 152 chapter 8 persistent sgxb consider the incident angle on the cross section as uniform as a consequence we can safely neglect the variation of the velocity of the wind relative to the star across the cross section 18 and write the relative speed of the wind with respect to the accretor vrel vw vc we also neglect any variation along the x axis normal to the orbital plane figure 8 2 sketch to represent the tilted accretion cylinder due to the circular motion at a velocity vc of the accretor around a static star which emits a radial wind the red hatched surface is a three dimensional representation of the cross section of the accretion cylinder which has the z axis as a normal axis the x axis is normal to the orbital plane the upper right panel represents the configuration in the orbital plane from shapiro and lightman 1976 the inflow through the transverse cross section does contain a net angular momentum due to 1 a lower density since the flow is isotropically diluting on the side with y 0 further away from the star than the side with y 0 2 a different relative velocity for different segments of the cross section 19 indeed the cross section is a disk in solid rotation around the star which makes each of its surface element at a variable distance r from the star orbits it with a local velocity r where is the orbital pulsation we do neglect the direction shift visible on the two extremities in figure 8 3 but we do not neglect the change of magnitude it induces the angular momentum per unit time crossing an element of surface centered in a fiducial point p of the cross section is given by d 3 l op v p d 3 m 8 6 by symmetry the net angular momentum relative to the y axis will yield zero after integration we then 18 which is less constraining than assuming the orbital separation small compared to the acceleration radius such as once the wind reaches the accretor it would already be at a constant terminal speed v 19 due to as explained above a different orbital velocity for each segment we neglect the wind speed variation

the asymmetries in density and relative velocity across the cylinder face contribute with opposite signs to the net angular momentum flux the fastest portion of the flow with respect to the cross

net specific angular momentum dl dm 1 2 2 hl 8 12 in practice we expect deviations from this value since it relies on the accretion radius which is only an order of magnitude deduced from a qualitative approach numerical simulations by livio et al 1986 and ruffert 1999 suggest that the actual accreted specific angular momentum for high mach number flows undergoing adiabatic evolution is actually three times smaller indeed the main flaw of this demon stration is the neglecting of the variation of the wind velocity across the accretion cylinder cross section the domain of validation of this assumption if we take the velocity profile to evaluate the wind speed variation is indeed hardly met since we would need 1 vw vc 2 a r 8 13 which is generally not verified in a sgxb where the wind speed at the position of the accretor is already several times larger than the accretor orbital speed where the filling factor is not small 60 and where the mass ratio is large the breaking up of this hypothesis has the respective minor and major effects 1 in the second equation of the system 8 9 in the r h s a second term dominant should be added following for instance the velocity profile as a guideline since the wind is faster further away from the star it enhances the relative velocity asymmetry in 8 9 2 the model of the accretion cylinder itself is jeopardized since the accretion radius is not the same on both sides of the accretor in spite of the enhanced relative velocity asymmetry pinpointed above the influence of the relaxation of this assumption is not obvious because the cross section over which is integrated the angular momentum no longer a disk becomes larger on the side closer from the star and smaller on the other one aware of this limitation let us use the approximate evaluation 8 12 with the correction factor 1 3 men tioned above to compare the circularization radius associated to this specific angular momentum to the size of the accretor with r and m the radius and mass of the accretor and m the mass of the star the necessary condition of existence of a disk like structure around the compact object deduced from 8 12 is the following hl a 4 36 1 m m 3 for m 10 m r a 8 14 it is a necessary condition to assure that the circularization radius is larger than the accretor to compute the accretion radius hl we rely on the velocity profile 8 4 and

stellar radius and a the orbital separation linked to the period through kepler s third law at a fixed terminal speed the dependence on the orbital separation can be understood through the depen dence of the velocity profile the shorter the orbital separation the larger the accretion radius and the specific angular momentum and the larger shear in the accreted flow for lower orbital separation the figure 8 4 summarizes this discussion by emphasizing the need for short periods and low terminal speeds to favour the formation of a wind capture disk the expression 8 14 provides an expression 20 for the circularization radius of a wind accretion flow to be compared to the one we had for a rlof mass trans fer given by 7 20 we see that the likelihood of the formation of a disk is much smaller for a wind mass transfer as long as the accretion radius is smaller than the distance from the compact object to the first lagrangian point one can see that it is the case for realistic wind terminal speeds but it takes slightly lower velocities 21 to make the two scales comparable in this case the existence of a disk ceases to be a chimera figure 8 4 likelihood of the formation of a wind capture disk as a function of the orbital period and the terminal wind speed the dashed line is the maximal envelope which matches the criterion 8 15 for a stellar mass and radius of respectively 20 m and 15 r and a neutron star of 1 4 m while the solid one is for a stellar mass and radius of respectively 25 m and 25 r and a neutron star of 1 9 m the size of the neutron star is set to three times its schwarzschild radius and the exponent at 0 8 20 when the inequality is replaced with an equality the radius r is the circularization radius 21 due to an accretor lying within the acceleration zone of the donor star or an aborted wind acceleration due to an ionizing flux from the compact object high enough to strip the metals from all their electrons 156 chapter 8 persistent sgxb conclusion if we have seen that the formation of a disk was a possibility to keep in mind even for a wind mass transfer its actual existence and its structure are difficult to foresee in particular the disk can extend well beyond the circularization radius derived above because of angular momentum by viscous torques however if the central object is a neutron star its magnetosphere will interact with the disk possibly disrupting its inner parts taking those effects into account requires to go beyond the simplified model above and actually compute the specific angular momentum entering the vicinity of the accretor what we perform in the next sections of this chapter 8 2 numerical launching of the stellar wind since we work with sgxb systems where the mass ratio is large we can afford to neglect the influence of the neutron star on the launching of the wind indeed the latter is mostly determined in the very vicinity of the stellar surface far from the gravitational influence of the tiny compact companion to validate our computation of the streamlines in the sgxb configuration we first confront the numerically integrated one dimensional velocity profile for an isolated star to the theoretical predictions 8 2 1 ballistic approximation as pinpointed by shapiro and lightman 1976 the stellar wind is highly supersonic and this approxima tion holds until the gravitational deflection induced by the compact object leads to the crossing of the bal listic streamlines numerical simulations of the wind such as the ones performed by walder et al 2014 and manousakis and walter 2015 suggest that from the stellar surface to the vicinity 22 of the accretor the flow is essentially ballistic indeed as validated a posteriori by the one dimensional numerical bench mark in figure 8 5 described in section 8 2 3 the line acceleration peaks close from the stellar surface and the wind typically at a the temperature of the photosphere reaches supersonic speeds shortly after it leaves the surface we amalgamate the sonic surface to the stellar one which prevents us from investigat ing intrinsically time variable behaviors related to internal shocks cohen et al 2014 or instabilities e g clumps within the wind for a steady state investigation of the outflow which accounts for the pressure see lamers and cassinelli 1999 it must also be mentioned that including the ionizing feedback from the close in of the compact object on the flow upstream leads to departure from ballistic configurations see the photoionization wake in blondin et al 1990 though at values of the mass ratio too low to fit sgxb however starting the wind requires initial conditions not only on the position and the velocity but also on the initial velocity radial gradient indeed accounting for the finite cone effect requires an estimate of the initial velocity gradient as stated by 6 28 in chapter 6 the results described below proved very ro bust provided we select an initial velocity at the stellar surface of the order of the sound speed the first radial step can be chosen to be a fraction of the stellar radius and the corresponding velocity can be de rived from a fiducial law velocity profile see 8 4 with realistic parameters deviations of those values within an order of magnitude yield results dispersed within a range much smaller than the characteristic dependences we want to study 8 2 2 numerical scheme degrees of freedom the ballistic assumption enables us to solve a simplified equation for the motion given by equation 6 19 in chapter 6 while still capturing a representative dynamics of the wind this expression is valid using the stellar radius r and the modified escape speed vesc m divided by p 2 as units of length and velocity at this point the shape of the velocity profile depends only on the force multiplier the dimensionless 22 within a volume whose typical size is a few times the accretion radius 8 2 numerical launching of the stellar wind 157 shape parameter introduced in section 6 3 2 is not a degree of freedom and is fixed by the requirement to get a unique solution and the value of it encapsulates the q and force multiplier the eddington parameter the stellar luminosity and the mass loss rate the latter is thus entirely determined by the other aforementioned parameters the inclusion of the finite cone effect does not fundamentally alter the previous comments provided is replaced with its product with the initial value of the finite cone correction factor d d r r v v r r 1 8 16 so as the new is 1 times larger than its expression deduced from 6 21 and 6 22 this workaround guarantees that the first integration steps are proceeded in the same way as in the case of the point source problem whose analytical solution is known and requires a precise value to not be ill defined nevertheless since d is always above its initial value for r r it means that the acceleration is larger than for a point source the terminal speeds are expected to be higher than the ones given by 6 23 in chapter 6 the effect of this workaround on the mass loss rates and terminal speeds have been dis cussed in section 6 3 5 the equations detailed in section 6 3 lead 23 to a modified mass loss rate m d r r v v r r to account for the finite cone correction consistent with the mass outflow being halved compared to the plain cak model for the values of we consider without this workaround the numerical launching of the wind is doomed to fail since the critical conditions are not matched at the sonic surface i e with our model at the stellar surface to solve the unidimensional ballistic equation of motion we applied a fourth order runge kutta scheme on a test mass starting anywhere on the homogeneous surface of the star the time steps are chosen to be smaller by a factor of 100 than any time homogeneous combination of the displacement the velocity and the acceleration so as to not alter the outcome of the numerical integration it also proves accurate according to the limited drift of the mechanical energy of each test mass from its initial value as mentioned above the only parameter which constrains the shape of the solution is the force multiplier even once the finite cone angle is taken into account since the correction parameter depends only on and on the solution of the equation of motion which itself is set by in this sense we call a shape parameter as opposed to the scale parameters which only serve to set the scale of the solution i e the stellar radius and the modified escape speed divided by p 2 8 2 3 results the results of the numerical integration with and without the finite cone angle factor 6 28 noticed re spectively fd and cak are displayed in the upper panel of figure 8 5 solid lines as expected the velocity profile is higher when the finite cone angle is taken into account what appears more clearly when look ing at the terminal speeds computed at a few 10 stellar radii bottom panel of figure 8 5 the analytical profile 6 24 given for a point source matches the one we compute numerically within a few percents but not the profile obtained with the finite cone correction for the latter we figure out terminal speeds and exponents which enable to fit the numerically computed data and obtain approximately v r v 1 r r 0 7 with v 2 5 vesc m 1 8 17 the exponent 0 7 instead of 0 5 for the analytical solution with a point source makes the velocity pro file somewhat smoother which is consistent with observations villata 1992 and sophisticated semi analytical computation of modified cak wind profiles pauldrach et al 1986 villata 1992 m ller and vink 2008 araya et al 2014 though on the lower end of the range on the other hand the expression of the terminal speed is in agreement with state of the art hydrodynamical simulations m ller and vink 2008 noebauer and sim 2015 and analytical studies see kudritzki et al 1989 table 1 though only for temperatures above the bi stability threshold 24 at 21 000 k vink et al 1999 since we are interested in 23 with the present assumption of a sonic surface identified to the stellar surface 24 below the factor 2 5 drops and so does the intensity of the wind 158 chapter 8 persistent sgxb donor stars of earlier or similar spectral type as early b stars we expect to remain in this regime and can fully rely on this terminal speed notice that this law leads to generally higher terminal speeds than the one suggested by friend and abbott 1986 but to similar values than the observed ones for class i luminosity stars see table 3 of groenewegen et al 1989 if one considers 0 55 8 3 wind motion in a roche potential setting the stage 8 3 1 context normalization sgxb feature low eccentricity orbits compared to the other classes of hmxb which justifies from now on to work with circular orbits 25 see also section 7 3 1 so as to reduce the dimensionality of the space of shape parameters and efficiently explore it we rely on the following normalization 1 the stellar roche lobe radius rr 1 as the length scale 2 the mass of the compact object m 2 as the mass scale 3 gm 2 r 2 r 1 as the acceleration scale unless explicitely stated in the rest of the manuscript this system of scaling is the one we use the velocity scale for instance is deduced by the simplest combination of the length and the acceleration scale i e the square root of their product without any additional factor we did not consider the departure from the spherical shape of the stellar surface more important for bodies close from roche lobe overflow but still too low to fundamentally alter the results see figure 7 6 we also discard the asynchronous rotation of the star it is supposed to have reached synchronization with the orbital period see comments on synchronization in 7 3 3 8 3 2 scale invariant expression of the equation of motion we now set ourselves in the frame co rotating at the orbital period 26 with the center of mass cm as the origin and use subscript 1 resp 2 to refer to the star resp to the compact object as described in figure 8 6 as reminded in chapter 7 the modified gravitational force of the star the gravitational force of the compact object and the centrifugal force acting on a test mass can then be written as the roche potential and kepler s third law can be used to show that its shape depends only on the mass ratio and on the eddington factor if we account for the continuous radiative pressure one must also consider the coriolis force per mass unit which cannot be written as a potential at this point q and are the only shape parameters of the problem the radius of the star does not play a role since in roche s formalism both objects are point like 27 numerically it means that q and are the only meaningful parameters for the study of the motion of a test mass in a roche potential accounting for radiative pressure since the scaling back to physical units can be realized afterwhile we can now gather those terms with the absorption lines acceleration the dimensionless expressions of the positions of the test mass relatively to the star and the compact object write with the notations of 25 the introduction of eccentric orbits would not require major modifications in the code but would break up the steady state assumptions each effective separation as the neutron star orbits the supergiant star at a non constant angular speed would have to be considered and treated as if the wind unfolded quickly compared to the time between two successive positions on the orbit it would add a time modulation at the orbital period to the possible time variable behaviour within the vicinity of the compact object otherwise fed with a steady state though inhomogeneous inflow 26 and so do all the velocities we refer to in this chapter 27 we will see in a moment that it enters the equation essentially as an initial condition on the position 8 3 wind motion in a roche potential setting the stage

interesting dependence of the finite cone effect correction factor d on the force multiplier like in the previous sec tion 8 2 but also now that we no longer normalize the lengths with the stellar radius on the filling factor this equation illustrates that the filling factor f the eddington factor the mass ratio q m 1 m 2 and the force multiplier are the cornerstone parameters of the sgxb toy

shimada et al 1994 for ob supergiants with 520 000 atomic lines and they depend mostly on the effective stellar temperature t and the surface gravity log g the decimal logarithm of its value in cgs units is usually considered in the literature 8 3 wind motion in a roche potential setting the stage 161 2 the stellar luminosity relatively to the eddington limit a k a the eddington parameter for ob

possible values 3 q the mass ratio we ran simulations for 12 integer values of q ranging between 7 and 18 4 f the filling factor we picked up 10 values non regularly spaced between 50 and 99 8 3 3 the modified accretion radius as visible in the upper panel of figure 8 5 the neutron star typically lies within the acceleration zone of the stellar wind this feature makes the case for a specificity of sgxb compared to symbiotic binaries where the wind driven by a different mechanism whose properties are less precisely known than for winds of hot stars has nonetheless reached its terminal speed once it gets in the gravitational vicinity of the accretor to evaluate the volume where the gravitational influence of the neutron star is large enough to significantly deflect the flow and break up the ballistic assumption we can rely on a modified accretion radius computed along the lines of the one described in the simplified framework of the bhl flow see chapter 4 the bottom line of the derivation of this radius is to wonder which are the streamlines which undergo at some point a change in potential energy comparable to the kinetic energy of the bulk motion at infinity all this solely due to the action of the accretor for sgxb the infinity is hazardous to define due to the fact that the orbital separation and the acceleration radius are of the same order furthermore the flow is not planar since it comes from a spherically diluting source whose curvature radius is not negligible and is sheared by the joint action of the coriolis the centrifugal 30 and to a lesser extent the gravitational force of the compact object see 8 1 3 in a pragmatic attempt to overcome those difficulties we compute a modified accretion radius using the following process we first ask what would be the motion of a streamline starting from the point on the stellar surface the closest from the neutron star if all the forces but the gravitational attraction of the compact companion were present it provides information about the kinetic energy transferred to the wind once the streamline reaches the orbital separation independently from the action of the accretor the corresponding velocity is written v we rely on this kinetic energy to evaluate the critical pseudo impact parameter that we call the modified accretion radius and still write hl hl 2 gm 2 v 2 2 v 2 8 20 where the last equality is the evaluation of the modified accretion radius using the dimensionless velocity at the orbital separation in the units system previously specified variations around the process de scribed above to compute the modified accretion radius have convinced us that this quantity leads to consistent and robust evaluations of the accretion vicinity given the numerical simulations performed in the reduced problem of bhl flow in chapter 5 we can now define an extended accretion radius rout which corresponds to the volume where a proper hydrody namical treatment is required we evaluated this radius to approximately 8 times the accretion radius in 5 2 2 to guarantee that the shock has weakened enough in the wake of the accretor to be back in a super sonic weakly perturbed regime the extended accretion sphere of radius rout defines the zone around the accretor where the ballistic framework described here gives way to a hydrodynamical simulation which takes as outer boundary conditions the streamlines at the orbital scale we will therefore consider this volume as a black box within which the present study can not make any definitive conclusion 30 indeed the latter being centered at the center of mass of the system and not at the stellar center it does not preserve the purely radial velocity of the flow with respect to the star 162 chapter 8 persistent sgxb 8 3 4 numerical implementation sampling to appreciate the orbital structure of the steady state wind from the hot evolved supergiant companion we first sample the upper half 31 of the stellar surface using a standard spherical meshing notice that it is not a homogeneous tessellation of the sphere in the sense that neighbouring points delimit patches of varying surface a point to account for when we want to make any statement on a fraction of the stream lines verifying a certain property the typical initial mesh first admitted a few thousands longitudinal i e east west departure points on the surface and four times less 32 in the latitudinal direction how ever given the large velocities of the wind and the slight bending in the parameter space we consider the points which give birth to streamlines which get close at some point of the compact object are always part of a subset of the stellar surface the orange region in figure 8 7 with a longitudinal coordinate between 4 and 4 and a latitudinal coordinate between the equator and a 0 such as tan 0 2 rout a 8 21 in particular the many points well above the orbital plane are not likely to feed directly the compact object and are then of fewer interest in our study we limit ourselves to streamlines launched from this region a safety check assures that the streamlines which intersect the extended accretion sphere start always well within this angular region and not on its border integration selection as explained in 8 2 2 in the one dimensional case of an isolated star we integrate the trajectories using a fourth order runge kutta this time though we stop the integration once one of the following conditions is met 1 the test mass crashes back onto the star with the prescription described in 8 2 2 to account for the finite cone factor and the fact that the mass ratio is large this case does not present on the line joining the two centers 2 the time integration takes an excessively long amount of time 3 the test mass is farther from the stellar center than the sum of the orbital separation and the ex tended accretion radius i e the extended accretion sphere has been missed 4 the streamline intersects the extended accretion sphere the first case is a sanity check to control whether our assumption that the wind can be treated as if the star was isolated at least at launch holds the second one monitors a possible case of lost streamline which would be trapped within the potential unexpected given the large terminal speed compared to the other velocities at stake in the model the third and fourth cases are more realistic and stand for respectively a test mass which freely passes by the neutron star without being involved in the accretion process and a test mass which is susceptible to cross a region where hydrodynamical effects are no longer negligible the latter streamlines are the ones selected for further investigation 31 the problem admits an up bottom symmetry with respect to the orbital plane which enables us to compute the streamlines only in the upper half and to copy and paste the results for the lower part once we want to post process a subset of streamlines 32 to have an angular aspect ratio of approximatively one at the equator 8 3 wind motion in a roche potential setting the stage 163 x 0 4 4 y z a figure 8 7 sketch of the area of the stellar surface susceptible to produce a wind accreted by the compact object orange patch its longitudinal extension is of 2 centered on the direction of the compact object black dot in the lower right part of the figure and its latitudinal extension above the orbital plane 0 computed following 8 21 the extended accretion sphere has been represented in dark green around the accretor refinement ballistic simulations are affordable enough to let us raise the number of streamlines we work with to do so we refine the meshing of the departure points on the stellar surface when they yield selected stream lines after integration we refine in both angular direction proceed to a second integration for all those new points and reiterate the refinement step until we get a similar number of selected streamlines a few 10 000 whatever the values of the 4 degrees of freedom some of the streamlines closest from the orbital plane and finally selected have been represented in orange in figure 8 6 in a fiducial case a similar sketch for each configuration q f is automatically produced to give the user an idea of the bending of the streamlines the relative size of the extended accretion sphere etc density after several refinements we are now left with arrival points on the virtual extended accretion sphere centered on the accretor 33 each of those points has velocity components but we also want to be able to evaluate the shear of the inflow we must quantify the deformation of the arrival map compared to the departure one due to the steady state assumption the conservation of mass guarantees that the streamlines do not intersect each other however the cross section of the flux tube which surround each of them evolves something we can monitor by using the four neighbouring streamlines the ratio of the surface they delimit on the extended accretion sphere by the one of the surface they delimit on the 33 to make sure that the last iteration brings the test mass very close from this sphere not too far within or outside we shorten dramatically the timestep as the test mass approaches it 164 chapter 8 persistent sgxb star yields the evolution of the mass density times the magnitude of the velocity of the streamline from an extremity to another once we will set the scale parameters and compute the quantities such as the photospheric mass density and sound speed in physical units we will be able to relate each of the arrival point to a certain local density the appendix a 3 details how to compute the surface elements on the sphere an angular resampling of those primitive quantities mass density and velocity on pre defined meshes provides us with physically motivated outer boundary conditions for upcoming hydrodynamical simula tions on the final fate of this inflow to each cell of the mesh are associated values of density and velocity components computed as an average over the values associated to all the arrival points weighted with a gaussian kernel centered on the cell and of width approximately the size of the cell in terms of arclength since we are still working on a sphere computational cost the whole computation time per simulation on 1 cpu including the post processing described in the next paragraph is of the order of a few hours such as the dimensionless parameter space considered in section 8 3 2 3 3 12 10 1 080 configurations can be explored within a week with 36 cpus comment on the computation of the outputs all this output values obtained by averaging or integrating combinations of density and velocity values on the extended accretion sphere have been computed in two different ways to guarantee their robustness 1 directly with the values of density velocity and flux tube cross section of each streamline 2 using the values resampled on a spherical mesh on the extended accretion sphere with two different resolutions 16 64 and 64 256 usual spherical coordinates the computational pipeline has been corrected and improved until the outputs obtained following those three approaches prove close from each other the final output values given further are obtained by simply arithmetically averaging the three values visualisation of the outputs once computed the plethora of possible outputs requires a visualisation tool to be analyzed the nu merous data sets produced by those simulations are prone to be obstacles to the understanding of the dependencies at stake if one does not care about the question of their visualisation in particular we need to be able to explore not only the four dimensional dimensionless space parameters but also the role of the three scale parameters their choice and the effective set up of this tool using the spyre library for python developed by a hajari 2015 is detailed in appendix a 4 8 4 structure and properties of the flow at the orbital scale 8 4 1 structure of the accretion flow we now try to quantify what we mean by wind accretion the usual smoking gun to qualify an accretion of wind accretion is to observe a star which does not fill its roche lobe with an accreting companion however it does not tell us much about the actual structure of the flow indeed a wind which would not be fast enough compared to the orbital velocity once it reaches the critical roche surface would result in a https github com adamhajari spyre https github com adamhajari spyre 8 4 structure and properties of the flow at the orbital scale 165 highly collimated flow mimicking the stream one usually associates to rlof nagae et al 2005 rlof tells us something about the filling factor while wind accretion refers to the structure of the flow not necessarily incompatible with rlof thus we choose to term wind or stream an accretion flow depending on the relative size of the extended accretion sphere where the shock is expected to develop with respect to the size of the roche lobe of the compact object rr 2 when the wind is slow the former becomes of the order or even larger than the latter and the whole orbital scale requires a proper hydrodynamical treatment to evaluate how slow the wind must be to be in such a configuration we plotted in figure 8 8 the evolution of the ratio of the aforementioned length scales compared to the ratio of v by the orbital speed where v has been defined in 8 3 3 once again none of these quantities was forced instead they were computed from parameters linked to the launching of the wind and the structure of the potential a first conclusion is that even in configurations where the filling factor is close to one wind accretion is expected for efficient wind acceleration i e 0 55 for any eddington factor below 30 it is a typical situation where rlof cohabits with wind accretion on the other hand even for a filling factor as low as 90 one can get a stream dominated flow for 0 45 intermediate mass ratios and eddington factors of 30 we observe that lower values of i e of the dimensionless luminosity favor a wind dominated flow which can sound paradoxical but is actually consistent with the velocity of the wind scaling as the modified escape speed in 8 17 see sections 3 2 3 and 8 9 2 of lamers and cassinelli 1999 for a physical interpretation an important conclusion to draw from this figure 8 8 is also that as far as the structure of the accretion flow is concerned the ratio v a is an excellent tracer to evaluate how windy the flow looks much more reliable than the filling factor which only plays a secondary role here in the case of radiatively driven winds we also advocate in favour of this ratio rather than the ratio of the mean normal velocity of the wind on the critical roche surface by the orbital speed vr a as suggested in nagae et al 2005 and jahanara et al 2005 indeed first since the accretor lies within the wind acceleration radius it is more relevant to consider the velocity of the wind at the orbital separation than at the critical roche surface which must not be considered as seriously in sgxb as in systems hosting low stars symbiotic binaries lmxb in figure 8 6 the critical roche surface is represented for 0 but in sgxb the lowering of the effective stellar gravity by the radiative pressure from the continuum opacity is no longer negligible second it is not equivalent to model the wind as described in chapter 6 and to consider that the radiative pressure exactly balances the stellar gravitational force at any radius ie 1 and gcak 0 as used in theuns et al 1996 and jahanara et al 2005 it is legitimate in symbiotic binaries where the mechanism responsible for the driving of the wind is still poorly known but not in sgxb as a consequence the conservative threshold on v a we found of the order of 2 to 3 should prove to be more reliable in sgxb than vr a 0 5 derived in nagae et al 2005 8 4 2 wind capture and scaled mass accretion rate we introduce several quantities to evaluate the fraction of matter which is accreted by the compact object the first one 34 is a numerical measure of the fraction of the wind entering the extended accretion sphere dashed green circle in figure 8 6 and solid green sphere in figure 8 7 from which we can guess an effectively accreted fraction using the results of chapter 5 then we will confront this quantity and its dependencies on the shape parameters to a theoretical prediction made by neglecting the non planarity of the flow hl and to a potential indirect tracer l of the fraction of the wind accreted introduced by abate et al 2013 for symbiotic binaries 34 the superscript refers to the fact that not all the matter entering the extended accretion sphere is expected to be accreted but all the finally accreted streamlines belong to this sample the fraction of stellar wind entering the extended accretion sphere is an upper limit on the fraction of stellar wind being accreted 166 chapter 8 persistent sgxb figure 8 8 ratio of the extended accretion radius by the size of the compact object roche lobe as a func tion of the ratio of the velocity at the orbital separation by the orbital speed for each of the six curves from upper left to lower right we used values of q f along the line going from 8 0 99 to 17 0 5 in figure 8 10 so as to probe the largest range of rout rr 2 direct numerical measures first we save the fraction of stellar wind entering the extended accretion sphere a first underestimate is obtained by comparing the number n of streamlines which were selected in the sense defined in section 8 3 4 to the total number n of streamlines within the launching patchwork considered 35 and then by extending it to account for the whole sphere n n 2 sin 0 2 8 22 where the numerator of the second factor of the r h s is the solid angle covered by the launching patch work is an underestimate because it does not account for the fact that the classical meshing of the sphere we rely on is not homogeneous it is less dense at the equator from where come most of the streamlines selected than at the poles because of the 36 r sin arclength which separates the points along the longitudinal direction another way to evaluate is to compute the surface delimited on the stellar sphere in blue in figures 8 7 and 8 6 by the streamlines selected to do so we compute the mean arc 37 l between selected streamlines and compute n l 2 2 8 23 in practice because 0 remains small 8 22 is only a slight underestimate of the order of a few percent compared to the second estimate of due to the matching between those two independent estimates 35 the orange area in figure 8 7 36 where is to be understood as the colatitude not like 0 which is a latitude 37 it is an angle the ratio of the arclength by the radius of the sphere on which it is measured here the stellar radius r 1 to measure it between two points on the sphere one just needs to use the dot product between the position vectors which locate those two points the arc appears in the cosinus 8 4 structure and properties of the flow at the orbital scale 167 we consider their arithmetically averaged value as representative of the actual fraction of the wind entering the extended accretion sphere concerning the actual fraction of the wind which will take part in the feeding of the compact object and in the subsequent emission of x rays we can not make any definitive measure without three dimen sional simulations of the evolution of the flow within the extended accretion sphere however an indirect measure of can be obtained using the results of el mellah and casse 2015 described in chapter 5 in deed if we write m ec 15 the mass inflow which was arbitrarily set as an outer boundary condition in el mellah and casse 2015 and m acc the mass accretion rate which was then measured for mach numbers at infinity larger than 4 the fraction of the wind entering the sphere of radius 8 hl which was actually accreted is given by m acc m ec 15 0 77 m hl v 8 hl 2 0 77 82 1 8 24 where and v are the mass density and the velocity at infinity 38 remarkably enough we observed in chapter 5 that this ratio no longer depends on any parameter and remains fairly constant when the mach number is above 4 which is easily verified by the highly supersonic winds in sgxb theoretical estimates of the accreted wind fraction for the theoretical expectations we have two predictions we can confront to first we can use the com puted dimensionless velocity of the wind at the distance of the orbital separation v to make predictions on the fraction of the wind being accreted by the compact object according to a bhl approach boffin and jorissen 1988 corrected with an additional factor 0 77 it has been shown to be accurate within a few percent for mach numbers at infinity larger than a few foglizzo and ruffert 1996 el mellah and casse 2015 if we assume the wind to be isotropic we have using the conservation of mass r 21 1 v 1 a 2 v 8 25 with refers to the values at the orbital separation a and the subscript 1 to the values at the stellar surface then the fraction of the wind accreted is given by 8 1 that we rewrite with the 0 77 factor hl 0 77 m hl m 1 0 77 2 hl v 4 r 21 1 v 1 0 77 4 hl a 2 0 77 e 2 q v 4 8 26 where m 1 and m hl are respectively the stellar mass outflow and the bhl mass accretion rate the last equality uses 8 20 and 7 8 apart from the factor 0 77 this expression is strictly the same as the equa tion 7 by abate et al 2013 for a wind speed large compared to the orbital speed a decisive point we emphasized in 8 26 above is the independence of hl on the scaling whatever the period the orbital separation or the mass of the compact object the fraction of the wind accreted according to bondi hoyle lyttleton s sketch is the same if the 4 shape parameters remain unchanged this comment will be of prime importance in the interpretation of the results presented in section 8 4 3 in the context of the wind rlof model developed by mohamed 2010 for symbiotic stars it has been suggested that the fraction of the asymptotic giant branch agb star outflow accreted by the stellar com panion could be higher than the bhl prescription above in abate et al 2013 an empiric non mono tonic function of the mass ratio q and of the ratio x of the wind acceleration radius rd by the roche lobe radius of the donor star rr 1 abate et al 2013 represented in figure 8 9 is introduced to fit the numeri cal experiments from mohamed 2010 the wind acceleration radius is defined as the distance to the star where the wind reaches the local escape velocity for sgxb where the mass ratio is high we can interpret the latter by comparing the specific kinetic energy of a test mass to the stellar potential only 39 in symbi otic binaries the acceleration radius is believed to scale with the stellar radius and a ratio of temperatures 38 approximation acceptable since the flow is almost not disturbed from planarity when it enters the simulation space at 8 hl see outer boundary conditions 4 1 to 4 5 39 not to the whole roche potential 168 chapter 8 persistent sgxb figure 8 9 ratio between the mass accreted by the sec ondary star and the mass lost by the primary the agb star as a function of the ratio between the wind acceler ation radius and the radius of the roche lobe of the pri mary the lines correspond to theoretically motivated predictions for different mass ratios while the markers are the results of hydrodynamical simulations by mo hamed 2010 the maximum fraction of the wind ac creted has been forced to 50 in the case of sgxb the wind accelerates very quickly but because the star can be close from filling its roche lobe while in symbiotic binaries the agb star is usually well inside its roche lobe it can happen that the wind reaches the escape speed only outside the stellar roche lobe the ratio x can then be around the unity value also where the am plification compared to the bhl approach is significant albeit for different physical reasons than in a symbiotic binary figure from abate et al 2013 not relevant in the present discussion see equation 1 in abate et al 2013 which means that their ratio x depends only on the filling factor among the parameters we consider in particular defined as such it does not depend on the mass ratio to account for the specificities of wind acceleration for hot massive stars and compute rd we can summon the velocity profile 8 17 and include the dependence on the force multiplier x rd rr 1 f y 8 27 where y is the solution of the equation obtained by using 8 17 to spot the distance from the star at which the wind reaches the local escape speed relatively to the modified gravitational potential of the star y 1 1 y 1 4 1 2 5 2 8 28 for symbiotic binaries other expressions of this ratio have been identified using the specific launching mechanism of agb stars leading to a different velocity profile h fner 2007 following abate et al 2013 let us finally define the empirical relation represented in figure 8 9 be tween a theoretical value of the fraction of wind accreted sb the mass ratio q and x rd rr 1 which is a function of the filling factor f and of the force multiplier sb max 25 9 q 2 c 1 x 2 c 2 x c 3 hl 8 29 where c 1 c 2 and c 3 are three fitting coefficients who abate et al 2013 evaluated using simulation results from mohamed 2010 performed with q 1 7 we choose the maximal value between the empirical fit and hl to avoid the polynomial expression to yield non physical values however these coefficients can not be expected to fit well the case of sgxb since an essential similarity with symbiotic binaries breaks up here the kinetic energy of the wind approaching the accretor compared to the gravitational potential of the latter is always much larger in sgxb than in symbiotic binaries and will lead to different values of those three fitting coefficients this statement is directly supported by the dependency of hl on the dimensionless velocity of the wind at the orbital separation in 8 26 the question of the amplification of the mass accretion rate and of the dependencies with the mass ratio the filling factor and the force multiplier though subsist and are addressed below 8 4 structure and properties of the flow at the orbital scale 169 assessment of the theoretical tracers the relevance of the wind rlof model for symbiotic binaries is a suggestive hint that wind accretion can prove more efficient than what the bhl prescription would suggest let us evaluate the relevance of the two previously introduced theoretical predictions sb and hl by confronting them with the measured figure 8 10 represents in the upper part the measured fraction of wind accreted from our simulations and the wind rlof predicted values for symbiotic binaries both for 40 0 45 as expected sb is several orders of magnitude larger due to wind speeds much lower in symbiotic binaries a few 10 km s 1 than in sgxb a few 100 km s 1 at least let however discuss the dependencies of those fractions of wind accreted on the mass ratio and on the filling factor for it is no surprise that at a given mass ratio as the star fills a lower fraction of its roche lobe the relative distance between the stellar surface and the compact object rises since the terminal velocity does not depend on the position of the sonic point and since the stellar gravity is largely overrun by the absorp tion lines acceleration close to the surface we can expect the velocity at the compact object position with respect to the unchanged orbital velocity to be larger and thus a lower extended accretion radius rout compared to the unchanged orbital separation in other words the angular size of the extended accretion sphere as seen from the star drops and so does the fraction of the wind being accreted however if one considers at a given filling factor a rise in the mass ratio let us say at a given mass of the compact object things get trickier indeed on one hand the terminal speed is proportional to the escape velocity which rises and on the other hand relative distance between the stellar surface and the compact object drops giving the wind less room to accelerate thus it is not possible to conclude a priori about the evolution of with q and numerical computation was indeed required to obtain this tendency for any filling factor rising the mass ratio from 7 to 18 leads to a drop in the fraction of wind accreted by a factor 3 this di dactic yet insightful reasoning illustrates how misleading qualitative approaches can be in systems where variables are as entangled with each other as sgxb concerning the dependency of the fraction of wind being accreted by the compact object with respect to it will be discussed in greater details in the discussion devoted to the predicted x ray luminosities section 8 4 3 but a first observation we make it that it follows the dependency of rout rr 2 in figure 8 8 as rises the wind acceleration gets more efficient and the terminal speed is higher making the speed at the orbital separation larger and the computed accretion radius smaller thus both and hl drop by approximatively an order of magnitude as rises from 0 45 to 0 65 since a rise in all other things being equal also means a lower stellar mass outflow according to 6 26 we expect much lower x ray luminosities for 0 65 than for 0 45 statement to be confirmed by figure 8 11 afterwards although the fraction of wind being accreted depends on it is worth noticing that it does not depend on the q force multiplier whatever its value the velocity profile remains unchanged eventually for the influence of a rise from 10 to 30 only results in a rise of a factor less than 2 for and hl but it will play a more important role once its influence on the mass outflow is taken into account sb shows little dependency on the filling factor compared to the measured indeed for 0 45 x varies from 0 8 to 1 4 for a filling factor going from 50 to 99 which corresponds to a rise by a factor of approximately two in figure 8 9 too low compared to the rise by a factor of 4 derived from the upper left panel in figure 8 10 this discrepancy is likely due to the fact that in symbiotic binaries the specific kinetic energy of the wind is of the order of the roche potential amplitude which leads to a non isotropic dilution of the wind around the star see figure 1 in mohamed and podsiadlowski 2011 the wind has time to be beamed towards the accretor for smaller filling factors which partly compensates the larger distance between the stellar surface and the vicinity of the accretor this departure from isotropy of the wind is much less pronounced in sgxb at least outside of the extended accretion sphere in the formula of abate et al 2013 8 29 the dependence on the mass ratio is accounted for empirically focusing on the fact that for a given set of trajectories the accretion radius scales as the mass of the accretor and thus the fraction of wind accreted rises with the square of the mass of the accretor this evolution is an overestimate since it neglects the fact that the cross section of the accretion cylinder is a disk which intercepts the flow 40 the conclusions drawn in the following paragraphs remain qualitatively valid for 0 55 and 0 65 170 chapter 8 persistent sgxb figure 8 10 upper panels measured and predicted fractions of wind accreted according to 8 29 ob tained for 0 45 and 0 2 as a function of the filling factor and the mass ratio the lower panel displays the relative discrepancy between the measured fraction of wind accreted and the one predicted by the bhl prescription 8 26 used with the computed velocity at the orbital separation v 8 4 structure and properties of the flow at the orbital scale 171 of a spherically diluting wind which expains why sb overestimates the dependence on the mass ratio the bottom part of figure 8 10 indicates that the enhancement of the fraction of wind being accreted with respect to the bhl prescription is much lower in sgxb than in symbiotic binaries provided the wind speed at the orbital separation and not the terminal speed is used to compute hl we retrieve the mea sured value of within 6 for the mass ratios and the filling factors we consider we then rely on hl from now on to estimate the fraction of wind being accreted 8 4 3 physical mass accretion rate and x ray luminosity scale parameters as a preliminary paragraph to this section we first discuss the numerical values of the scale parameters they have been chosen so as to suit observers needs but also their measuring precision capacities 1 the orbital period p which is precisely known when measured according to their positions in the corbet diagram see section 2 1 3 the orbital periods of sgxb range between 3 and 20 days 2 the mass of the compact object m 2 lying in a narrow range of values 1 to 2 m approximately and of prime importance to constrain the equation of state of ns 41 3 the dimensionless q force multiplier introduced by gayley 1995 which ranges from 500 to 2 000 and amounts to 900 with little dispersion for ob supergiant stars shimada et al 1994 it serves to compute the amplitude of the mass loss rate so as to compute thermodynamical quantities e g the mass loss rate the density etc we need to set in addition to the mass of the compact object and to the orbital period of the system an additional energy related normalization variable we chose the eddington luminosity which makes a direct measure of the stellar luminosity and can be directly computed from the value of q and the mass scale parameter mass accretion rate and x ray luminosity interestingly enough figure 8 10 shows that for a fixed mass of the compact object the fraction of wind accreted decreases when the mass of the supergiant star rises but notice that this statement along with all the ones made in the previous section concerns only the fraction of wind which is accreted not the actual physical mass accretion rate since a larger stellar mass also means a larger absolute mass loss rate according to 6 26 the evolution of the x ray luminosity with q could still be different to compute the physical mass accretion rate we rely on the expression 6 26 of the mass loss rate divided by a factor 2 to take into account the influence of the finite cone angle effect see section 6 3 5 on the other hand we use 8 26 for the fraction hl of wind accreted by the compact object the product of the two yields the physical mass accretion rate and the relation 1 15 provides the corresponding luminosity essentially radiated as x rays given the compactness of the ns and the conclusions drawn in the introductory chapter 1 in figure 8 11 has been represented the evolution of the steady state x ray luminosity as a function of the 4 shape parameters we set a fiducial value of m 2 1 8 m for the mass of the accreting ns and accord ing to 42 6 26 the x ray luminosity scales as the mass of the ns similarly we set the q force multiplier to 1 000 and lx q 1 given the restricted range of expected values for q and m 2 and the weak depen dency of lx on them we chose to highlight the dependence of the x ray luminosity on the dimensionless parameters 41 given the mass ratios we consider the present investigation applies mostly to accreting ns however since their intrinsic properties do not play a role except a gravitational one replacing them by bh accretors is possible 42 provided the stellar mass encompassed in the eddington luminosity is written as the product of the mass ratio by the mass of the accretor 172 chapter 8 persistent sgxb figure 8 11 representation of the permanent x ray luminosity described in section 8 4 3 as a function of the filling factor f x axis for different force multipliers different panels and eddington factors different colors the weaker dependence on the mass ratio which ranges from 7 to 18 is represented by the thickness of each line the lower limit being for larger mass ratios those results are computed for an intermediate value of the q force multiplier of 900 we also set a fiducial value of m 2 1 8 m for the mass of the neutron star and lx m 2 changing the orbital period while keeping those quantities invariant does not change those luminosity profiles 8 4 structure and properties of the flow at the orbital scale 173 the stronger dependence of lx is on the force multiplier with a luminosity divided by 20 each time alpha rises from 0 45 to 0 55 and then 0 65 each decreasing increment on entails a division of the x ray luminosity by a factor of approximately 6 a lower effective gravity makes the wind terminal speed which scales as the effective escape speed at the stellar surface decrease which leads to enhanced accretion of matter we also notice that larger values of the force multiplier lower the relative dynamical range of x ray luminosities fast winds leave less room to the influence of the other parameters the luminosity rises by about an order of magnitude from a filling factor of 50 to a configuration where the star is close to fill its roche lobe f 95 the weakest dependence is on the mass ratio it turns out that at a fixed mass of the accretor larger stellar masses lead to lower x ray luminosities in the balance aforementioned the fact that a larger stellar mass implies a larger wind speed and thus a smaller accretion cross section prevails over the larger mass loss rate however the balance between those two effects weakens significantly the dependence of the x ray luminosity on the mass ratio weaker than the one on the filling factor f the eddington parameter and the force multiplier given the low luminosity levels observed for 0 65 and even for 0 55 we can affirm that most of the sgxb we observe verify 0 45 0 55 if it matches theoretical predictions from stellar atmosphere models for early type b stars 43 shimada et al 1994 it is a bit below the values expected for o stars 0 6 which might suggest that the supergiant companions in sgxb are anomalously inefficient at accelerating their winds given their spectral properties maybe because of an anomalously low metallicity 44 this figure also enables us to pinpoint the degeneracies between the parameters indeed we notice that a luminous star with a wind opaque enough 45 to be efficiently accelerated i e 0 3 and 0 55 yields very similar x ray luminosities whatever the mass ratio or the filling factor as a lower luminosity star with a less efficient radiatively driven acceleration i e 0 1 and 0 45 a more spectacular property of the mass accretion rate emphasized by this parametrization with both shape and scale parameters is the independence all other parameters being equal of the x ray luminos ity on the orbital period in agreement with figure 8 1 the key point is that if the orbital period rises hl is not altered since the accretion radius rises in the same proportions as the orbital separation indeed at a fixed filling factor it induces a larger stellar radius and alters the modified escape speed at the stellar sur face in the same proportions as the reference velocity used as a velocity scale gm 2 rr 1 because the velocity of the wind simply scales with the modified escape speed at the stellar surface the dimensionless velocity at a distance of an orbital separation v remains the same and so does the fraction of the wind being accreted according to 8 26 on a more straightforward hand changing the orbital period does not modify the stellar mass outflow 46 in the end we are left with strictly the same x ray luminosity as a consequence we claim that any dependency of the observed x ray luminosities on the orbital periods must be attributed to a departure from the permanent bhl s purely wind accretion sketch typically a rlof mechanism or to an underneath correlation not taken into account for instance between the eddington factor and the stellar radius expected to be smaller for shorter period systems not undergoing rlof in no case the orbital period could be considered as the main culprit for the x ray luminosity merely as a cor related quantity whose causal relation to the permanent luminosity must be traced back the approach of section 8 1 2 to account for the observed range of x ray luminosities is according to this comment un satisfying it provides an effective empirical way to portray the evolution of the x ray luminosity with the period but only because stellar evolutionary arguments are likely to make the orbital separation and so the orbital period negatively correlated with the filling factor a proper explanation should rather rely on the latter parameter more directly involved in the building up of the x ray emission 174 chapter 8 persistent sgxb 8 4 4 shearing of the accretion flow the question of the angular momentum accretion rate and of its dependencies with respect to the 4 shape and 3 scale parameters remains do the configurations favourable to large mass accretion rates correlate positively with the likelihood to form a disk around the accretor in wind dominated mass transfers to possibly form a disk like structure around the accretor the flow needs to gain enough angular mo mentum as it approaches the compact object similarly to the quantities and in the previous section we introduce numerical tracers of the likelihood of an inflow to form a disk we also measure quantities both based on a streamline approach and on a mesh approach and check the matching between the two a first dimensionless quantity of interest is the ratio of the inflow of angular momentum by the amount needed to place the matter on a circular orbit at the accretion radius the main advantage of this quantity is that it depends only on the shape parameters and in particular it does not depend on the mass of the accretor it turns out to evolve in a similar fashion as whose dependencies have been detailed in the pre vious section at a given mass ratio the flow presents higher absolute values of angular momentum at the surface of the extended accretion sphere for lower ratios of the velocity of the wind at the orbital separa tion by the orbital speed a see also figure 8 8 since the angular momenta at stake in our simulations figure 8 12 upper left panel colormap of the relative size of the circularisation radius of the flow en tering

temperature between 20 and 30 000 k 44 the observational bias introduced by our limited sensibility does anyway artificially enhance the fraction of marginally low metallicity observed donors for radiatively driven winds 45 with respect to the metal absorption lines 46 at least for large mass ratios for which we supposed that the mass of the ns was too low compared to the stellar mass to alter the launching of the wind essentially determined by the conditions at the sonic here stellar surface 8 4 structure and properties of the flow at the orbital scale 175 at a scale where the coriolis force marked the trajectories are all negative it means that the coriolis force plays a more important role in systems where the wind speed is lower a result explained by the fact that the force has more time to bend the trajectories feature which overcompensates for the lower intensity of the force in this regime whatever and within the extended accretion sphere the angular momen tum of the flow keeps evolving 47 which makes any statement about the tendency of the flow to form co or counter rotating discs around the accretor hazardous however for the flows where rout rr 2 the ones strongly wind dominated we can affirm that the extended accretion sphere is deeply enough embedded in the gravitational potential of the compact object to make the angular momentum of the flow approxi mately constant it turns out that those pure wind accretion configurations typically the blue squares in figure 8 8 feature the lowest levels of angular momentum inflows those configurations are associated in the order of decreasing influence to high low f high and high q we also compute a dimensionless circularization radius given the amount of angular momentum and of mass entering the extended accretion sphere per second for the moment the absence of scale pre vents us from comparing the circularisation radius rcirc to the schwarzschild radius rschw of the neutron star as the latter is set by the mass of the compact object 48 a degree of freedom not encompassed by the 4 shape parameters the circularisation radius can be measured relatively to the accretion radius such a comparison sheds light on the way a disk like structure could possibly form provided it does the ratios hl rr 2 and rcirc rr 2 follow the same trend as but more interestingly the ratio rcirc hl also follows this trend indicating that the bending of the shocked structure is stronger for low q high f low and high in the upper left panel of figure 8 12 has been represented this ratio as a function of q and f for 0 55 and 0 20 yet the circularisation radius still remains two orders of magnitude smaller than the accre tion radius 49 characteristic of the size of the shocked region we can then conclude that apart in case of significant gain of angular momentum a winding up of the whole shocked tail is not to be expected if a disk forms it grows within the shocked region as witnessed in numerical simulations by blondin 2013 where substantial instabilities are believed to take place foglizzo and tagger 2000 whether those in stabilities drive variations of the front shock position large enough to bring the coriolis bending in action remains to be investigated the previous comments would turn out to be of little interest if the inflow crashes on the ns surface before it can reach its circularisation radius indeed a major difference with symbiotic binaries is that in sgxb the accretor is small enough to let plenty of room for the shock to develop and possibly within it to a disk to form once a scale is set see preliminary paragraph of the previous section on the scale parame ters the ratio rcirc rschw can be represented along with rcirc hl discussed in the previous paragraph for intermediate values of the and parameters see upper panels in figure 8 12 it shows that the circularization radius lies approximately two orders of magnitude below the accretion radius and two to three orders of magnitude above the ns surface given the sketch in the bottom part of figure 8 12 we can affirm that the accretion radius is approximately one hundredth of the orbital separation for the fiducial set of shape parameters considered 50 according to the upper panels the circularization radius is approx imately 500 times smaller than this accretion radius and 200 times larger than the schwarzschild radius of the ns so approximately 100 times larger than the ns itself for a compactness parameter of 25 con sequently we retrieve the ratio 100 500 100 5 106 between the orbital separation and the characteristic size of the ns in a representative sgxb this intermediate position of the circularisation radius between the shock and the ns surface tends to immunize a putative disk both against disruptive instabilities at the shock level manousakis and walter 2015 and against premature truncation by the magnetosphere see order of magnitude 1 11 in section 1 1 4 provided the angular momentum does not significantly evolve within the extended accretion sphere more importantly we notice that for at 0 55 or below and 47 since the roche potential is strictly speaking not isotropic 48 it is also because it summons the speed of light which can not be computed as long as the system units is not fixed 49 for very unefficient wind acceleration with 0 45 the circularisation radius is still smaller than the accretion radius but more by one order of magnitude only 50 which has been chosen deliberately to lie on the lower edge of the flows susceptible to form a disk higher filling factors and lower mass ratios make the circularization radius still small enough to fit within the shock and large enough to confortably escape the magnetosphere influence 176 chapter 8 persistent sgxb for moderately high values of the filling factor the likelihood to form a disk follows the same trend as the one drawn by the x ray luminosity the most luminous systems are also more likely to feature a disk like structure around the accretor 8 5 wind accretion on stage we now go on by assessing the self consistency of our toy model how far from the observations can be the plethora of parameters we have access to from a reduced number of key quantities 8 5 1 a roadmap to self consistent system parameters the theoretical four shape parameters our toy model is based on are theoretical tools which encapsulate all the scale free dynamics of the problem 51 however they do not correspond to the observables we have access to in this section we aim at providing a minimal though comprehensive track through the maze of physical quantities in sgxb which fit our model if the applet we designed see appendix a 4 is the handy carriage to travel through we now give a map for a quick journey to a consistent overview of a sgxb we first introduce the relations we will rely on to deduce the broad set of parameters available in this toy model we start with the following set of 6 parameters we call prior parameters selected for their accessibility to observations and or their necessity to deduce the other parameters 1 the orbital period p 2 the mass of the compact object m 2 3 the stellar temperature t 4 the decimal logarithm of the stellar surface gravity in cgs units log g 5 the force multiplier 6 the q force multiplier 7 either the terminal speed of the wind v or the average x ray luminosity of the system lx let us illustrate the procedure we follow starting from the above set of prior parameters spectroscopic inquiries of the pressure broadened balmer and he ii lines coupled to stellar atmo spheres codes set constraints on the decimal logarithm of the effective surface gravity and on the stellar temperature t 1 see e g clark et al 2002 to know the actual surface gravity log g thus requires to cor rect for radiative pressure sander et al 2015 one can however rely on the calibrated data for the same spectral type of stars see e g searle et al 2008 puls et al 2008 log g features few dependences f and p plus a weak dependence on m 2 and q such as it narrows the range of filling factors possible f 0 32 q 1 2 e q 1 q 1 3 78 82 m 2 2 m 1 6 9 d p 2 3 10 3 log g 2 8 30 with g in cgs units and where the bracket evaluates the factor it embraces as q goes from 7 to 18 the dependence on the mass of the compact object is also weak accounting for a few percent only for a neu tron star since the orbital period is precisely known when measured we can affirm that log g is a direct 51 whether the stellar volume is of the order of the solar one or a bucket does not change the slightest things to the dimensionless results at least those which do not make use of external constants such as the speed of light 8 5 wind accretion on stage 177 figure 8 13 all the possible values spanned by the stellar radius r 1 as a function of the only parameters which influence it indeed the stellar radius is computed from the filling factor f and the size of the stellar roche lobe rr 1 with the formula 7 8 hence the dimensionless r 1 depends on the filling factor only but so as to compare it to solar radii it requires the knowledge of the length scale rr 1 set by the orbital period p from left to right column the mass of the compact object m 2 from upper to lower line the mass ratio on the right side already converted into stellar masses using m 2 and the resort to kepler s third law 178 chapter 8 persistent sgxb measure of the filling factor its precise knowledge i e with a precision of at most a few percent along with the orbital period is a precious and sufficient asset to enclose the value of the filling factor in a 10 to 20 precision range in parallel we deduce the eddington factor from the prior of t and log g 0 23 t 25 kk 4 103 log g 8 31 a first sanity check can be realized here checking whether correcting the effective surface gravity with this value of does lead to a value of log g consistent with the one above from stellar spectral type consider ations the values we get using the two equations above hold whatever the and q force multipliers but will participate to set the mass loss rate and thus the average x ray luminosity concerning the two force multipliers listed as prior parameters they were calculated by shimada et al 1994 for ob supergiants with 520 000 atomic lines and they depend mostly on t and log g for solar metallicity and effective temperatures between 20 and 30 kk typical of the early type b stars we consider in the upcoming section 52 q 900 and 0 5 with little departure from those values here a junction shows up either we make use of a measured velocity of the wind at infinity 53 which is not always available nor precise or we rely on the x ray luminosity of the system which requires a precise estimate of the distance to the sgxb 54 and more dramatically to assume a trivial relation like 1 15 between the mass accretion rate and the x ray luminosity e g without reprocessing of the x rays the first option leads once the wind speed at infinity corrected for the finite cone effect 8 17 is accounted for to the following relation q e q 1 q 1 3 0 023 f 1 1 2 v gm 2 p 1 3 2 8 32 the mass ratio is then obtained after a numerical inversion with a newton raphson root finder for in stance this operation however leads to a poor level of precision on the value of q due to a low variation of the l h s in the range of mass ratios considered 55 it is thus preferable to make the most of the whole cou pling between phenomena our model relies on and to compare the result obtained above to the one ob tained using the x ray luminosity the non trivial coupling of the latter with the other parameters makes a manual monitoring of the q values compatible with the persistent x ray luminosity observed compulsory but feasible with the waso interface described in appendix a 4 the weak dependence of lx on q blamed in 8 4 3 does not make this operation very precise neither the matching between the two values of the mass ratio above is a good hint in favour of a reliable value of the mass ratio what we will show in the next section with eclipsing sgxb where the mass ratio is observationally constrained in any case once the mass ratio is determined we are left with all the shape and scale parameters opening the doors to all the remaining variables and in particular the stellar radius see figure 8 13 mass luminosity and mass outflow the wind mass density the dimensions of the accretion sphere around the neutron star and the circularisation radius compared to the size of the compact object a clue which indi cates the likelihood of the formation of a disk one can finally summon additional independent measures e g of the stellar radius of the spectroscopically derived stellar mass or theoretical expectations e g the wind momentum luminosity relationship of section 6 3 6 to discuss the reliability of the initially considered mass of the compact object the only truly arbitrary prior 52 except if explicitly stated 53 which does not depend on the q force multiplier 54 generally available thanks to the spectral energy distribution fits accomplished by coleiro and chaty 2013 and coleiro 2013 55 approximately from 6 to 11 for q 7 18 8 5 wind accretion on stage 179 8 5 2 classical persistent sgxb selection procedure we now discuss the case of three persistent sgxb likely being archetypes of this observational category vela x 1 xte j 1855 026 and igr j 18027 2016 a k a sax 1802 7 2017 for short we nickname the second one xte and the third one sax we ended up with these three classical sgxb using the following require ments suitable to fit our toy model applied to the sample of 20 available sgxb 1 an orbital period has been measured 2 the location of the system in the corbet diagram walter et al 2015 figure 5 is consistent with sgxb orbital period below 20 days and spin period of the pulsar above 100 seconds 3 to avoid any discrepancy on the force multipliers due to metallicity related issues we focused on sgxb within the milky way mokiem et al 2007 4 to avoid the net shift in the fraction of the wind being accreted induced by an eccentric orbit see equation 6 in boffin and jorissen 1988 we selected systems where the eccentricity is below 0 1 which invalidates for example 4 u 1907 097 according to nespoli et al 2008 5 we rejected potential intermediate sfxt such as the eclipsing igr j 16418 4532 and igr j 16479 4514 6 we rejected the systems where rlof was suspected or confirmed cen x 3 7 we did not retain the systems hosting a black hole candidate cyg x 1 or even 4 u 1700 377 due to the mass ratios and the assumption of mildly perturbed spherical wind we considered 8 we selected systems where the star was not excessively evolved as in gx 301 2 9 we discarded systems featuring a peculiarly slow wind oao 1657 415 10 the neutron star is eclipsed by its stellar companion so as to be able to retrieve additional informa tion from radial velocity measurements using eclipsing systems where the best fits ephemerides of the light curves set constraints on the mass ratio is a way to compensate for the low precision of the mass ratio obtained from the measures of the terminal wind speed and the average x ray luminosity nevertheless the former is flawed by the unknown inclination of the system an issue our approach is not influenced by in the incoming table 8 1 the values between parenthesis are the ones if the system is seen edge on while the other one is the limit case of rlof interestingly enough a look a posteriori to the corbet diagram in figure 2 4 indicates that those three systems identified with an additional blue circle around the marker lie in a close region of the p pspin space it might support the idea that the properties of the accreting neutron star age magnetic field etc are similar and indirectly favor a wind dominated mass transfer observed parameters we searched the literature to gather the parameters displayed in table 8 1 the spectral types of vela x 1 and xte have been found in coleiro and chaty 2013 who also pro vide the corresponding effective temperature for sax we used the conclusions of torrej n et al 2010 following their approach we read the corresponding stellar parameters in searle et al 2008 table 5 however the value obtained from this modeling approach for the surface gravity of sax leads with 8 30 to a star which largely overflows its roche lobe for masses of the compact object larger than even 0 5 m 180 chapter 8 persistent sgxb vela x 1

order of orbital period the second set of stellar parameters are deduced from methods not directly based on the stellar spectral type radial velocity measures eclipses the pairs of numbers for the wind parameters are not the extremal values found in the literature but correspond to the slow and fast regimes we will consider to check self consistency the parameters in bold are among the lever quantities we use to deduce the other ones the x ray luminosities reported are for an energy range between 3 and 100 kev 8 5 wind accretion on stage 181 we thus discard it and pinpoint an important discrepancy between the surface gravity deduced from the stellar spectral type and the one compatible with the accreting regime of the system concerning the ob served parameters we deduced the actual surface gravity from the measured radius and mass for the observed stellar parameters and mass of the compact object in vela x 1 we relied on the radial velocity measurements made by quaintrell et al 2003 the values between parenthesis are the ones if the system is seen edge on while the other one is the limit case of roche lobe overflow the values measured by falanga et al 2015 essentially agree and so do the previous values given by van kerkwijk et al 1995 for the terminal speed of the wind we report both the low value obtained by gimenez garcia et al 2016 and van loon et al 2001 and the higher terminal speed deduced by watanabe et al 2006 yet we notice that van loon et al 2001 and gimenez garcia et al 2016 consider stellar masses and or radii marginally compatible with the ones derived by van kerkwijk et al 1995 quaintrell et al 2003 and falanga et al 2015 the mass loss rates are from gimenez garcia et al 2016 lower value and watanabe et al 2006 upper value the low value of the mass loss rate and the high value of the terminal speed are consistent with the theoretical predictions for isolated stars of similar spectral type searle et al 2008 albeit not necessarily relevant for the observed stellar parameters and mass of the compact object in xte we used the values de rived by falanga et al 2015 more precise than the ones derived by coley et al 2015 they based their approach on monte carlo best fit ephemerides of the light curves however they tend to determine low inclinations which turn out to be for xte and sax for instance below the critical ones to avoid rlof de rived by coley et al 2015 observational biases apart the filling factor does not physically have to be near unity as previously defended in section 8 4 1 for the parameters of the wind since they have not been directly measured to the best of our knowledge we used the values listed by searle et al 2008 for isolated stars of similar spectral type for the observed stellar parameters and mass of the compact object in sax we used the values derived by coley et al 2015 using radial velocities as for quaintrell et al 2003 the values between parenthesis are the ones if the system is seen edge on while the other one is the limit case of roche lobe overflow the stellar parameters are consistent with those determined by mason et al 2011 falanga et al 2015 obtained slightly larger masses for the star and the compact object for the parameters of the wind we used the values listed by searle et al 2008 for isolated stars of similar spectral type we proceeded in the following way to determine estimates of the average x ray luminosity we started from the fluxes we considered both the ones between 14 and 195 kev f 14 195 observed by the bat instru ment on swift http swift gsfc nasa gov results bs 70 mon and the ones given by walter et al 2015 in the hard x rays between 17 and 60 kev f 17 60 we used the estimates of the distances from walter et al 2015 coleiro and chaty 2013 kaper 1998 for vela from coleiro and chaty 2013 for xte and from walter et al 2015 for sax we neglected the absorption of those sources in these wavebands an assump tion legitimate for galactic sources as explained in appendix a 2 a prescription to account for absorption is also given there to extrapolate to broadband x ray fluxes we notice that filippova et al 2005 claims a broadband 3 to 100 kev x ray flux for xte approximately 3 times larger than f 17 60 and 1 5 times larger than f 14 195 assuming similar photon energy distribution for the three sources within this energy band we then deduce the corresponding x ray luminosities those x ray luminosities are merely estimates which must not be used but as guidelines the uncertainty we get for xte and sax is obtained by using both aforementioned waveband for the flux and by varying the distance to vela x 1 from 1 8 to 2 2 kpc notice that for vela x 1 a shorter distance has been derived by chevalier and ilovaisky 1998 and would lead to a higher x ray luminosity also the values we get for its average x ray flux between 3 and 100 kev are slightly below the usual x ray luminosity found in the literature 4 1036 erg s 1 possibly because of the higher absorption at the lower limit of the energy range we consider not corrected here those luminosi ties are thus lower limits we expect the use of those x ray luminosities combined with the measures of the terminal speed to yield mass ratios compatible with the ones measured by light curves fitting given in table 8 1 http swift gsfc nasa gov results bs 70 mon 182 chapter 8

parameters possible for each of the three systems considered using the equations 8 30 and 8 31 the subscript of each of the filling factor refers to the mass of the accretor in m it does not affect the value of the eddington parameter the un certainties represent on one hand the uncertainty on log g set to 0 05 around the centered value given in table 8 1 and on the other hand the variation of the mass ratio from 7 to 18 the lower resp upper edge of each range corresponds to q 7 resp q 18 and a maximum resp minimum value of log g each time the filling factor obtained was above 100 we set a dash to warn the reader that a rlof star is unlikely self consistent sets of parameters we start to explore the possible set of self consistent parameters for vela x 1 from table 8 2 given the high value of we start by setting it to 30 the lower value of the speed at infinity 700 km s 1 requires at most 0 45 and m 2 1 m the associated x ray luminosity would be larger than 1037 erg s 1 way above the permanent level observed for vela x 1 the stellar mean density would also be suspiciously low with a 10 m star having a 17 r radius given the observational constraints we discard this possibility and support the upper measured value of the wind speed at infinity of 1 700 km s 1 with 0 5 and q 900 typical of early type b stars with effective temperatures between 20 and 30 000 k we get a more realistic overview however even for an accretor mass as high as 2 m though where the filling factor has to be larger than 83 we hardly reach v 1 300 km s 1 and for very high stellar masses above 35 m hardly compatible with the spectral type the associated x ray luminosities would also be excessively large by a factor of 2 rising to 0 55 makes the x ray luminosity drop to a value several times too low and an eddington factor larger than 30 is unlikely given the stellar spectral type on the contrary keeping 0 50 but lowering to 20 the low end of the range we deduced from the effective temperature and the surface gravity brings us to v 1 600 km s 1 for q 11 and still f 83 to overlap this area with the available x ray luminosity and the estimated stellar mass outflow we must privilege a large value of the filling factor 95 and a moderately low value of the mass ratio q 12 coupled to the observational results derived from the eclipses it means that vela x 1 is almost seen edge on and that the lowest values of stellar masses and radii must be privileged with a circularization radius one hundred times smaller than the accretion radius the flow can cicrularize once it reaches a radius of approximately one thousand times the schwarzschild radius of the accretor depending on the extension of the magnetosphere it might be enough to see a disk like structure maintained in a short range of radii the orbital structure of the flow is mostly wind dominated the situation is very similar for xte which displays a fast wind a higher velocity means a larger stellar mass 56 at a similar filling factor and mass ratio which implies a drop in the x ray luminosity both be cause the wind is faster and because the mass ratio is larger the larger mass outflow is not enough to compensate for the smaller solid angle delimited by the extended accretion sphere we must thus either consider heavy accretors and set m 2 to 2 m with the canonical at 0 5 or intermediate mass accretors with m 2 1 5 m but a larger efficiency of the wind launching with 0 55 notice that the value of q does not play any role in the value of v and that is somewhat larger than the one derived for vela x 1 and can less easily be considered as low as 20 if the accretor is heavy the condition on v enforces a fill ing factor in a narrow range between 85 and 90 and a mass ratio above 15 if m 2 1 5 m we are left with all the upper right quarter of the f q space in the latter case the x ray luminosity is hardly compatible with the observed one merely reaching 1 5 1036 erg s 1 for q 13 and f 99 a factor of 2 to 3 below 56 remember that the terminal speed scales with the escape speed 8 5 wind accretion on stage 183 system vela x 1 xte j 1855 026 igr j 18027 2016 q 12 14 11 f 95 89 98 0 50

systematics dominate and are discussed in the text in more details those values serve to compare the three systems to each other not to specify precisely the parameters of each system they indicate a trend not a state the estimated value however for a heavier accretor the x ray luminosity found in the region compatible with the measured values of v lies between 4 and 6 1036 erg s 1 in agreement with the observations we thus support larger stellar masses and radii than the ones displayed in table 8 1 on the basis of this anal ysis with a stellar mass loss rate above 4 10 6 m yr 1 the circularization radius is one hundredth of the accretion radius and one thousand times larger than the schwarzschild radius of the accretor in spite of the large velocity of the flow it sounds like this configuration still leave room to the possibility to form a disk contrary to vela x 1 which however has a very similar mass ratio and filling factor for sax table 8 2 indicates that we deal with a very compact system where the lower radius of the less evolved star is not enough to compensate for the lower orbital separation whatever the mass of the compact object we deal with a stellar companion presenting a filling factor above 90 given the narrow range of values centered on 10 we enforce it to 10 since we do not expect the star way more massive than the accretor to be able to fill its roche lobe and transfer matter in a stable way we discard the heaviest accretor at 2 m and focus on the intermediate and lightest cases relying on the measured value of the velocity at infinity at a 10 precision level we find that compatible values of mass ratios lie 1 below q 11 in the lower right corner of f q space we consider 2 anywhere between q 7 and q 18 for m 2 1 m concerning the x ray luminosity and the stellar mass outflows the values are systematically lower than the values listed in table 8 1 mostly due to the lower value of the eddington parameter of this later spec tral type star solving this discrepancy requires an anomalously large q force multiplier 57 with a larger anomaly for a lower mass accretor since the star is less evolved it is possible that the stellar photosphere is denser which could rise the value of q by 20 see table 1 of gayley 1995 enough to solve the dis crepancy for an accretor of 1 5 m not for 1 m we thus privilege the former option over the latter for m 2 1 5 m and q 1 100 the configuration with an x ray luminosity compatible with the observations are confined below q 12 and above f 95 in agreement with the previous argument and in particu lar with the measure of the wind speed at infinity the confrontation with the observational constraints inferred using the eclipses shows a marginal overlap with our holistic derivation if the system is seen close to edge on the two approaches match and yield a system with the set of self consistent fundamen tal parameters listed in table 8 3 from which all the stellar orbital wind and accretion parameters can be derived a sketch of the most likely configuration is drawn on figure 8 14 bottom panel as visible on figure 8 4 with a wind speed at infinity of 1 100 km s 1 an orbital period of 4 47 days and the stellar parameters we derived the system lies approximately on the edge according to criterion 8 15 and thus deserved to be investigated with our toy model in the most likely configuration whose parameters are listed above the shearing properties are in favor of the formation of a wind capture disk the circular ization radius is 6 to 10 thousands times larger than the schwarzschild radius of the compact object and 57 remember that the wind speed is independent of its value 184 chapter 8 persistent sgxb only 10 to 20 times smaller than the accretion radius it is then likely that a disk forms within the shocked region the orbital structure of the flow is stream dominated 8 6 discussion the present work shows that in some persistent sgxb the differences from a system to another in terms of parameters of the flow at the orbital scale of the star of the wind and of the observed accretion can be understood by the present ballistic model we have made the case for a dichotomy between stream and wind dominated mass transfers independently from the a direct value of the filling factor in systems such as igr j 18027 2016 where the extended accretion sphere is of the order of the roche lobe of the compact object see bottom sketch in figure 8 14 the accretion might share similar features with the classical rlof observed in lmxb such as the presence of a disk like structure figure 8 15 sketch of the statistical clumpiness model developed by ducci et al 2009 a distribution of clumps are considered in their interaction with the compact object using a cross section approach see figure 8 16 the impact parameter is given by d and hl is the accretion radius the basis in the lower right corner is given as a reference for the figure 8 16 from ducci et al 2009 it has been argued that the time variability of the x ray luminosity could be due to inho mogeneities in the wind the time variation of the inflow within the extended accretion sphere can straightforwardly be implemented in the present model via a density modulation of the boundary conditions i e on the extended accre tion sphere in this way the present charac terization of the streamlines complements the model by ducci et al 2009 which does not ad dress the dynamical problem but neatly mod els the statistical distribution of clumpiness of winds at launching in sgxb the way the clumps size evolves as they flow away from the star 58 and the way they can be accreted through the effective cross section of the compact object within a couple of stellar radii the clumps are more contrasted with the background wind which makes clumpiness a good candidate for the time variability observed in classical sgxb but not necessarily in sfxt systems which can feature an accretor orbiting further away from the star in addition the density excess in clumps can hardly catch up with the large x ray dynamics in sfxt either large scale structures or phenomena in the vicinity of the accretor are then required we notice that the x ray luminosity levels we derive from our pipeline are in agreement with the ob servations listed in table 8 1 albeit on the lower side since those values are themselves slightly underes timated and because we consider an efficiency of conversion of mass accretion rate in x ray luminosity equal to the compactness parameter 59 the mass accretion rate we derive can be considered as too low however we did not account for the ionizing feedback of the accreting source which will at some point wiped out the possibility for the wind to be accelerated indeed if the x ray luminosity reaches levels high enough a str mgren sphere 60 forms around the accretor hatchett and mccray 1977 ho and arons 58 this part of the work owes much to the model developed by howk et al 2000 for the wind of the main sequence b 0 2 star sco 59 which is the maximal efficiency of the process we did not account for the possibility that part of the gravitational potential energy might not be converted in free radiations 60 since it does not take the same energy to fully ionize an hydrogen and a metal its size and its influence on the wind acceleration 8 6 discussion 185 figure 8 14 schematic scale free representations of the structure of the flow in three different sgxb from top to bottom vela x 1 xte j 1855 026 igr j 18027 2016 those

figure 8 16 the different cases for the accretion of a spherical clump with an impact parameter d with respect to the accretor the axis are the ones specified in figure 8 15 the problem reduces to a disk disk interaction between the geometrical cross section of the clump in gray and the virtual disk of radius the accretion radius in white centered on the accretor the black dot the smaller of the two is arbitrarily set as a forefront in each case in the first case all the clump is accreted while in the three other ones the overlapping surface must be computed to estimate the fraction of the clump accreted from ducci et al 2009 1987 stevens 1991 blondin et al 1991 ducci et al 2010 without any excitation level left a fully ionized metal can no longer absorb any photon and the radiatively driven acceleration described in chapter 6 is quenched such a phenomenon must be accounted for once we enter the extended accretion sphere and might lower slightly the value of the specific kinetic energy at the orbital separation v 2 we used to derive the accretion radius and by then the mass accretion rate since the mass accretion rate is very sensitive to the value of v even a small inhibition of the acceleration of the wind could lead to the factor of a few we miss to reach the observed levels we think the inhibition is not likely to come into play between the extended accretion sphere and the star since otherwise the quenching of the wind would be so strong that the system would systematically swing between a low and a high luminosity state the underlying positive feedback follows this principle the higher the mass accretion rate onto the compact object the larger the radiative feedback the larger the str mgren sphere the slower the wind to the inhibition pro cess described above the larger the mass accretion rate the saturation point of this loop is reached once the str mgren sphere is larger than the roche lobe of the accretor in this case the wind is no longer able to penetrate the roche lobe the mass accretion rate and following the same positive feedback the x ray luminosity vanishes we do not address this bi stability case and rather focus on systems where the str mgren sphere is likely to be confined most of the time well within the extended accretion sphere finally another scale must be considered once we enter the extended accretion sphere the magne tosphere it is also an additional reason to monitor closely the ionization level to evaluate how the flow couples to the magnetic field if the final fate of the flow in a disk and along the magnetic field lines does not essentially alter the total x ray luminosity it does modulate the spectrum comparing synthetic spec tra extracted from mhd simulations within the extended accretion sphere to observe permanent spectra is a possible extension of the present work will depend on the element considered 187 conclusion perspectives to briefly summarize the work presented in detail in this manuscript we have characterized the perma nent behavior of a hydrodynamical bhl flow being accreted by a compact object whose typical size is three to five orders of magnitude smaller than the scale of the shock formed by the incoming supersonic flow we then set the conditions to extend this work to a numerical setup representative of a supergiant x ray binary namely a realistic acceleration of the radiatively driven wind and the accounting of the non inertial forces associated to the orbital motion thanks to a customization of the geometry of the mesh and its boundary conditions an optimiza tion of the load balancing and an adaptation of the numerical scheme so as to suit the multi scale needs of the bhl flow onto a compact object we were able to span up to 6 orders of magnitude in space the equivalent of 17 levels of refinement in amr for the first time the size of the accretor in these highly con sistent simulations matches the relevant physical size of a compact object moving with a realistic relative speed through the wind doing so we brought a conclusive answer to the structure of the flow and the convergence of the mass accretion rate as the inner boundary size is reduced the flow which relaxed on our 2 5 d spherical grid featured a detached bow shock ahead the accretor with a hollow conic tail at high mach numbers and no axisymmetric instabilities provided physically accurate inner boundary con ditions are set up the evolution of the properties of the flow as a function of its mach number at infinity has been identified and compared to theoretical expectations we conclude that at mach numbers larger than 3 the mass accretion rate remains essentially unchanged as the opening angle and the distance of the shock to the accretor reduce the sonic surface was found anchored into the inner boundary what figure 8 17 logarithmic colormap of the density for a two dimensional simulation with amr of a planar flow onto a point mass the flip flop instability in the wake is clearly visible in black are represented a few streamlines 189 190 chapter 8 persistent sgxb ever its size for supersonic inflows and an adiabatic index of 5 3 in agreement with a monoatomic gas this observation matches the topological property derived analytically by foglizzo and ruffert 1996 and which lays at the basis of a theoretical evaluation of the mass accretion rate consistent with our measures for mildly supersonic flows we show that the fraction of mass accreted without crossing the sonic surface is larger which highlights the need for small inner radii to characterize mildly supersonic flows thanks to the unprecedented high dynamical range we have access to we could also follow the flow down to the vicinity of the accretor we now need to carry out a refined study of the axisymmetric stability of the steady state flow we ob tained indeed the stability of a bhl flow has long been a matter of debate according to the diverging conclusions that numerical groups have drawn since the late 1980 s as first pinpointed by foglizzo and tagger 2000 a resonant cavity where an advective acoustic cycle takes place can form between the shock and the sonic surface the latter being typically 100 to 10 000 times closer from the accretor the numerical study of this configuration has revealed how important this mechanism can be with a possible applica tion to the case of core collapse supernovae we already interpolated the relaxed state we got using a much finer grid in the central parts and relied on a less diffusive numerical scheme to monitor the non linear growth of the instability which does appear this new setup fits the needs for resolving wavelengths of perturbations corresponding to growth rates high enough for an amplification to take place in the cavity on a computationally affordable number of time steps first results indicate suggestive breathing modes excited by the interplay between entropic disturbances adiabatically advected inwards and outflowing acoustic waves the origin of this cycle and its saturation level remain to be numerically investigated if the instability proves to be amplified enough it might be able to excite in three dimensions transverse in stabilities responsible for torque reversals of pulsars in wind accreting hmxb 61 blondin and raymer 2012 given the robustness of the results detailed in the second part of this manuscript we decided to re lax the axisymmetric assumption and head towards fully three dimensional simulations because we go beyond the ideal bhl model the flow is no longer free of net angular momentum and the formation of a disc around the accretor is made possible to fit the physical conditions found in sgxb we modeled the launching of the wind following a refined version of the theory of radiatively driven winds to accurately grasp the acceleration stage within a couple of stellar radii in a zone where the accretor usually lies the numerical integrator we designed computes the trajectories of test particles submitted to radiative accel erations induced by line absorption and scattering by free electrons in a roche potential with the coriolis force we quantified the fraction of the stellar wind likely to be captured by the compact object using a modified expression of the accretion radius the toy model we designed couples the stellar orbital ac cretion and wind properties all together in a simple though comprehensive manner which emphasizes the fours essential flow numbers which shape accretion in sgxb the mass ratio the stellar filling factor and eddington parameter and the force multiplier of the wind thanks to the underneath coupling this code provides self consistent sets of parameters which can be visualized through the waso web interface we also have access to the amount of angular momentum accreted and thus to a direct tracer of the like lihood to form a disc like structure around the accretor the x ray luminosity and the likelihood to form a disc rise together and the promising sets of parameters are explicited this approach enables us to focus on the configurations which are likely to display a hybrid regime of accretion in between the asymptotic rlof and wind regimes if the former represented on figure 8 18 can not be straightforwardly summoned to explain the observations in sgxb the beaming of the stellar wind in the direction of the accretor can be important enough to qualify the wind mass transfer as stream dominated a regime which has been coined by mohamed 2010 as wind rlof our code enables us to evaluate the dimensions of the virtual sphere around the accretor which requires a proper hydrodynamical treatment analogous to the one described in the second part of this manuscript but without the enforced axisymmetry we are now in a position where we can implement physically motivated outer boundary conditions shearing of the inflow mass accretion rate velocity field etc in a fully three dimensional simulation centered on the accretor this strategy disentangles the large scale dominated by the orbital 61 the neutron star in the sfxt 4

accretion scale where hydrodynamical simulations come into play in my phd research i have made the most of this junction between a harvest of new wind accreting x ray binaries and the unprecedented computational power entailed by parallel computing to identify the conditions favorable to the formation of a disc around the accretor expected to be different from shakura sunyaev s disc model shakura and sunyaev 1973 which fits well the disks formed during rlof the wind capture discs may be a fertile ground for new kinds of instabilities involving for instance torque re versals the coupling between the essentially radial incoming wind of the star and the disc like structure might also display interesting behaviors at the interface between the two structures figure 8 18

function of the mach number of the upstream flow it is precisely because of the unphysical decrease of entropy below 1 that a subsonic flow becoming supersonic will in no case do so through a shock discontinuity the blue solid line is for 5 3 the dashed red for 7 5 and the black horizontal one is the limit for 1 where m 1 1 is the mach number of the upstream flow the ratios between the values of a physical quantity before and after the shock then depend only on the mach number of the inflow and its adiabatic index 1 those relations imply for the mach number of the flow downstream the

the mechanically non reversible transformation of the flow explains why a subsonic incoming flow becoming supersonic will never produce a shock front indeed imagine a similar configuration but with m 1 1 then those equations still hold at least down to a certain mach number but figure a 20 reveals that entropy would be damped 64 as a consequence a sonic surface is not associated to a shock a 1 2 oblique shock the more general situation of an oblique shock can be treated similarly provided we decompose the veloc ity vectors in their normal and tangential components written respectively u and w in this section from there we have strictly the same equations than in a 1 1 above but with u playing the role of v and the mach number m being replaced by the normal mach number m associated to u so

initially makes the deflection angle increase see curves in figure a 22 this deflection angle fi nally reaches a maximum and soon after the flow behind the shock is at mach 165 from this point the shock is no longer able to slow down the inflow to subsonic speeds finally the shock has totally vanished once the deflection angle reaches zero vertical lines in figure a 22 indeed with m 1 the relations above indicate an absence of discontinuity between the properties of the flow upstream and downstream a 2 absorption in a nutshell a 2 1 context and references the website of the bat instrument on the swift satellite provides the information concerning the photon flux they received in photon per time unit per surface unit http swift gsfc nasa gov results bs 70 mon once the spectrum is known the integrated flux over a specified photon energy range can be derived 66 in erg per second per centimeter squared so as to confront the observations of a few sgxb to the predicted time averaged x ray luminosities we derived from our simulations we need to convert those reported x ray fluxes to absolute luminosities the distances being known coleiro and chaty 2013 we can easily account for the spherical dilution and get the pristine luminosity if there was no absorption the one we call the apparent luminosity 67 to correct for absorption and trace back the absolute luminosity we relied on the thought experiment described below a 2 2 statistical description of the absorption let us model the absorbers in a given photon energy range by solid spheres of cross section 68 we place ourselves in an optically thin framework and thus neglect the diffusion properties of those objects which will be justified a posteriori in section a 2 3 if the density of absorbers n is assumed to be uniform along the line of sight we can think of their positions as randomly picked up within a column of transverse sur face s and of length the distance between the observer and the source d the ratio between the transverse size and the radius of the absorbing sphere of 10 is considered large enough to neglect the edge effects in the uniform case the number of absorbers n evolves linearly with the distance n n sd a 40 such as the number of absorbers is a direct measure of the distance to the source we can now evaluate the fraction of the transverse surface obscured by the absorbers as a function of the depth of the column to do so we simply select randomly the projected position of the absorbers within the transverse section and compute the shadowed surface with a monte carlo method we pick up at random approximately 1000 test points and check whether they end up in the disk like shadow of a sphere it results in the red 65 to find this and check whether it is indeed beyond the value corresponding to the maximum of one has to numerically solve the implicit equation which descends from the condition m 2 1 6614 to 195 kev for bat 67 not to be

regime we consider qualifies as optically thin and the toy model we presented in the previous section holds 69 except in case of a dense cloud along the line of sight especially in the vicinity of the galactic center where the volumic density can jump up to 105 cm 3 we discard this possibility for the 3 systems we consider 70 for the systems next door in the magellanic clouds the absorption can be lower due to the sharpness of the galactic disk and the lower density of absorbers in the intergalactic medium a 2 absorption in a nutshell 199 figure a 24 fraction of the column transverse section

primarily hyperbolic par tial differential equations by a number of different nu merical schemes porth et al 2014 the dimensionality the geometry of the mesh and the physical equations are handled uniformly so as to make the background code independent of them and to let the user choose and customize them with out altering the core subrou tines to do so the code is written in a fortan based language the lasy syntax toth 1997 and is then con verted into proper fortran files using a perl preproces sor which takes as inputs the dimensionality the sub grid size etc it automatically generates fortran files specifically designed to han dle the physical problem the user is interested in figure a 28 represents the generic skeleton code similar to most amr codes formally speaking proper uml

associated to accretion onto compact objects displays important levels of photometric and spectroscopic time variability when the accretor orbits a supergiant star it captures a fraction of the supersonic radiatively driven wind which forms shocks in its vicinity the amplitude and stability of this gravitational beaming of the flow conditions the mass accretion rate responsible in fine for the x ray luminosity of those supergiant x ray binaries the capacity of this low angular momentum inflow to form a disc like structure susceptible to be the stage of well known instabilities remains at stake using state of the art numerical setups we characterized the structure of a bondi hoyle lyttleton flow onto a compact object from the shock down to the vicinity of the accretor typically five orders of magnitude smaller the evolution of the mass accretion rate and of the bow shock which forms around the accretor transverse structure opening angle stability temperature profile with the mach num ber of the incoming flow is described in detail the robustness of those simulations based on the high performance computing mpi amrvac code is supported by the topology of the inner sonic surface in agreement with theoretical expectations we developed a synthetic model of mass transfer in supergiant x ray binaries which couples the launch ing of the wind accordingly to the stellar parameters the orbital evolution of the streamlines in a modified roche potential and the accretion process we show that the shape of the permanent flow is entirely de termined by the mass ratio the filling factor the eddington factor and the alpha force multiplier provided scales such as the orbital period are known we can trace back the observables to evaluate the mass accre tion rates the accretion mechanism stream or wind dominated and the shearing of the inflow tracer of its capacity to form a disc around the accretor avant propos i physical objects numerical tools introduction 1 accreting
