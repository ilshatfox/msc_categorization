urbana il 61801 usa received xxx revised xxx accepted xxx submitted to apj abstract the common envelope phase is a likely formation channel for close binary systems containing compact objects neutron stars in common envelopes accrete at a fraction of the bondi hoyle lyttleton accretion rate since the stellar envelope is inhomogeneous but may still be able to accrete at hyper critical rates though not enough to become black holes we show that common envelope systems consisting of a neutron star with a massive primary may be gravitational wave sources detectable in the advanced ligo band as far away as the magellanic clouds to characterize their evolution we perform orbital integrations using 1 d models of 12 m and 20 m primaries considering the effects of density gradient on the accretion onto the ns and spin evolution from the range of possible accretion rates relevant to common envelope evolution we find that these systems may be significantly louder gravitational wave sources than low mass x ray binaries like sco x 1 which are currently the target of directed searches for continuous gws we also find that their strain amplitude signal may allow for novel constraints on the orbital separation and inspiral timescale in common envelopes when combined with pre common envelope electromagnetic observations keywords binaries close gravitational waves stars neutron

had predicted that bhs would be the first gw sources to be detected with ground based gwdetec tors and in particular that massive stellar mass bhs should be found belczynski et al 2010 belczynski et al 2016 steven son et al 2017 belczynski et al 2017 it also led to the de velopment of numerous models proposing a wide variety of formation channels e g antonini et al 2016 abbott et al 2016 e d rodriguez et al 2016 marchant et al 2016 demink mandel 2016 raccanelli et al 2016 mandic et al 2016 these formation scenarios varying from plausible to specu lative produce stellar mass bhs in a sufficiently close orbit that gw emission can drive the binary to merger within a hubble time the channel originally proposed by belczynski et al uses common envelope ce evolution to achieve the needed orbital separation belczynski et al 2016 kruckow et al 2016 this phase of binary stellar evolution involves a primary star enveloping its companion so that the two stellar cores share a single envelope gravitational drag between the cores and the common envelope causes the binary to inspiral thus reducing the orbital separation as observations suggest that more than 70 of massive stars exchange matter with a nearby companion sana et al 2012 channels involving ce evolution are likely to be an important contributor to bbh populations and other compact binary systems e g taam sandquist

nsbhs with high mass x ray binary progenitors that undergo ce evolution wherein the ns survives the ce phase we take survival to mean that the ns both ejects the envelope preventing the formation of a thorne ytkow object and does not accrete enough mass to collapse to a bh during the ce phase ac cretion onto a ns companion may be hyper critical houck chevalier 1991 armitage livio 2000 however the

magnetic fields i e b 1012 g where the frequency is modulated by the ns spin frequency the strain amplitudes they estimate are 3 10 28 at a distance of 10 kpc in this paper we use the mr 15 model for ce evolution to estimate the gw emission from crustal deformations of ac creting nss undergoing ce inspiral and the resulting spin up we include a prescription to account for the effects of ns crust melting during inspiral which decreases the strain amplitude as the ns accretes at hyper critical rates we pro pose that a direct detection of gws from a ns ce binary may constrain estimates of the orbital separation and decay rate of the binary given a model for the primary star helping to address key questions in common envelope evolution such as the condition for merger versus stabilization as a close binary the mechanisms responsible for envelope ejection and the ef ficiency of envelope ejection we use scorpius x 1 sco x 1 a low mass x ray bi nary lmxb system as a reference continuous gw source the compact companion in this system is an accreting ns that has been observed to have an x ray luminosity lx 2 3 1038 erg s 1 which is consistent with the ns accreting at its eddington

b c to estimate the strain amplitude evolution of a ns under going ce inspiral we construct models for the ce structure ns orbital evolution ns accretion rate and gw emission from the spinning ns these models are simplified and pri marily serve to demonstrate how the strain amplitude and ns spin may evolve with the accretion rate as the ns inspirals performing global 3 d simulations will be the subject of fu ture work and will provide more accurate characterizations of the orbital evolution and the resulting strain amplitude our estimates for the accretion rates and strain amplitudes are up per limits given the simplifying assumptions we use it is possible for nss to accrete above the eddington limit i e to accrete in a hyper critical regime the lower limit on the accretion rate of hyper accreting nss is set by thermal neutrino cooling using the latest upper limits for the max imum quadrupole moment that the ns crust can sustain we estimate the greatest distance that hyper accreting nss would be detected at strain amplitudes comparable to sco x 1 in 2 we provide a brief review of aspects of ce theory needed for this work in 3 we discuss ns accretion and the physical regimes relevant to x ray binaries and common envelopes in 4 we review gw emission from accreting nss and discuss the torque balance assumption in 5 we describe the detailed model we use to predict the gw signal from ns ce systems in 6 we present the orbital evolu tion of our models we discuss in 7 how orbital separation and decay rate can be constrained and consider the detectabil ity of ns ce events with aligo we conclude in 8 with a summary of our results 2 common envelope preliminaries 2 1 evolutionary sequence a star in a close binary can expand over the course of its stellar evolution to the point where it envelopes its compan ion star thus initiating a ce phase it is thought that the ce phase involves a contact phase followed by a plunge in phase in which the companion undergoes a fast inspiral and finally a self regulated phase ivanova et al 2013 if enough orbital energy is dissipated in the envelope the system transitions to a post ce phase in which the remainder of the envelope is ejected in this paper we neglect the initial plunge which typically lasts 1 2 orbits in 3 d simulations and treat the entire orbital evolution as self regulated and driven by local gravi tational drag in the vicinity of the ns companion the ad equacy of this approximation remains to be shown for the binary system parameters we consider here we are under taking this task using 3 d simulations that will be presented in a future paper 2 2 the ce parameter the energy formalism is commonly used to parameterize ce evolution e g webbink 1984 using the efficiency ce with which orbital energy release unbinds the envelope the binding energy of the envelope ebind is then related to the or bital energy dissipated over the course of the inspiral eorb via ebind ce eorb ce gmcoremns 2 af

remains bound to it some observed systems 4 holgado et al require ce 1 implying that additional sources of energy contribute to unbinding the envelope 2 3 accreting neutron stars in binary systems 3 1

be parametrized using the theory of bhl accretion hoyle lyttleton 1939 bondi hoyle 1944 edgar 2004 the characteristic length scale for accretion onto an object of mass m moving at a speed v relative to a uniform medium with density and sound speed cs is given by rbhl 2 gm v 2 c 2 s 6 2 see demarco et al 2011 for a detailed review of the energy formalism if following mr 15 we neglect the sound speed then the characteristic length scale is the hoyle lyttleton hl accre tion radius rhl hoyle lyttleton 1939 we define the following parameters ra rhl 2 gmns v 2 7 a a ra v 7 b v cs 7 c herera is

9 b the actual accretion rate drag force and energy loss rate are reduced relative to the hl rates during ce inspiral as dis cussed in 5 2 3 3 hyper critical accretion during ce inspiral in hyper critical accretion thermal neutrino cooling is suf ficient to allow the accretion rate to exceed the eddington limit houck chevalier 1991 once the ns surface tem perature exceeds 1 mev photons can be trapped in the flow and a neutrino cooling layer is expected to form outside the ns surface the photon trapping radius is approximately rtr m t 4 c 10 5 7 1013 m m yr 1 t 0 34 cm 2 g 1 cm the shock

from eddington to hypercrit ical accretion occurs instantaneously physically the density of the gas falling into the accretion radius of the ns is high enough such that temperatures rise to the point where ther mal neutrino cooling will start to occur and allow for hyper critical accretion farther away from the ns transport of thermal radiation can efficiently cool the material that is gravitationally cap tured by the ns as a ns inspirals within the ce it creates density wakes that provide additional gravitational drag pho ton bubbles can travel faster through the less dense regions e g gammie 1998 and transport thermal energy away from the accreting material more efficiently than advection and conduction regions near the ns may also be unstable to the neutrino bubble socrates et al 2005 and photon bubble in stability such that perturbations in the flow are seeded grow exponentially and saturate into shock trains e g turner et al 2005 begelman 2006 turner et al 2007 as emphasized by mr 15 a finite density gradient in the stellar envelope breaks the symmetry of hl accretion mate rial gravitationally captured within the accretion radius may not be accreted onto the inspiralling companion due to the flow s angular momentum the background density gradient can be parametrized using the non dimensional quantity ra h ra d dr 13 where is the density of the background medium and h is the density scale height mr 15 found that the accretion rate decreases relative to m hl with steeper density gradients we describe the mr 15 model in more detail in 5 this result suggests that nss can survive the ce phase since they accrete only a small fraction of their initial mass during ce inspiral the actual accretion rate m during inspiral appears to satisfy m edd m hyper m m bhl m hl hence using m hl for the accretion rate should provide an upper limit on the gw emission due to accretion during ce inspiral assuming torque balance since the accretion rate suppression in the mr 15 model can be significant we use mr 15 instead of the hl rate in what follows 4 gravitational waves from accreting neutron stars in the weak field limit the gw luminosity from a spinning ns with a finite quadrupole moment q is approximately lgw 32 5 g 6 q 2 c 5 14 where is the spin angular frequency of the ns the fre quency of the emitted gws is twice the spin frequency fgw 2 fspin the corresponding torque exerted from the gw emission of angular momentum is ngw lgw 15 for optimally oriented gw sources the gw strain amplitude 0 measured by a distant gw detector is 0 2 g 2 c 4 d q 2 g 2 c 4 d i 16 whered is the distance between the source and the detector is the quadrupole ellipticity and i 1 5 mns r 2 z r 2 e is the moment of inertia of the ns if the accretion torque is greater than the gw torque then the ns spins up according to i nacc ngw 17 we will find that the duration of the ns spin up depends on the accretion torque such that the frequencymay be relatively constant depending on the coherence time used for the inte gration 4 1 ns mountains ns surface deformations away from axisymmetry i e mountains produce a time varying quadrupole moment and thus gw emission there are two types of ns mountains that may be present as the ns accretes during ce evolution ther mal mountains and magnetic mountains bildsten 1998 first described how electron captures in the crust of eddington accreting nss may generate density asymmetries on the ns surface if a transverse temperature gradient is present i e either from compositional variation asymmetric local accre tion flow buried magnetic fields etc and thus lead to gw emission the typical temperature of the crust of eddington accreting nss is of order 108 k such that the crust remains solid the maximum quadrupole moment of such thermal mountains depends on the properties of the ns crust where the crust ellipticity can be approximated as glampedakis gualtieri 2017 th cr brvcr gm 2 ns rns 10 5 br 0 1 18 where cr is the shear modulus of the crust vcr is the vol ume of the crust and br is the crustal breaking strain for magnetic mountains on nss with magnetar level field strengths b 1015 g the ellipticity may take on val ues of mag 10 6 10 5 our work is agnostic to the mechanism by which mountains are produced and only re quires that such quadrupole moments are achievable sev eral previous works have estimated what values of the maxi mum quadrupole moment may be sustained by the ns crust haskell et al 2006 applied the formalism presented by 6 holgado et al ushomirsky et al 2000 to both accreted and non accreted ns crusts and determined the maximum quadrupole moment to be qmax 2 1039 g cm 2 horowitz kadau 2009 performed 3 d molecular dynamics simulations of local re gions of ns crust to obtain estimated for the breaking strain with their estimate for the breaking strain horowitz kadau 2009 obtain a maximumns crust ellipticity of 4 10 6 with this bound on the ellipticity we thus use a maximum quadrupole moment of qmax 4 1039 g cm 2 for this work with this upper limit on the maximum quadrupole moment the strain amplitudes we estimate in 6 should be regarded as upper limits when the accretion torque approximately balances the gw radiation torque ngw nacc 0 the quadrupole moment can be expressed as a function of the accretion rate by using 4 and 15 to obtain qtb 5 32 c 5 g 5 m gmnsreq 1 2 19 since the mass and accretion rate change slowly compared to the gw period the implicit time dependence they introduce intoqmodulates the gw strain amplitude as the ns inspirals within the ce we treat our model ns undergoing ce evolution as be ginning in torque balance and spinning up if the required quadrupolemoment tomaintain torque balance is greater than the maximum quadrupole moment that the ns crust can sus tain at hyper critical accretion rates temperatures are of or der mev such that the the solid ns crust melts into liquid and erases surface deformations as long as there exists solid ns crust thermal mountains and or magnetic mountains may still be formed before they melt away our treatment of the crust melting process is described in 5 6 for the magnetar scenario the crust remains deformed by the global magnetic field as it is melting for the thermal mountain scenario the electron capture rates just need to vary enough with temper ature in order to produce the required quadrupole moment we include a derivation of the required electron capture rate temperature dependence in appendix a at accretion rates relevant to the fallback scenario the accretion torque is large enough such that the ns is spun up to secular instability which excites r modes that produce gws in 6 wewill show that accreting nss in the ce case do not spin up to secular in stability 5 methods here we describe how we use the considerations in the pre ceding sections to predict the gw signal produced by ns companions in ces with supergiant primaries the steps we take are 1 construct a model for the primary s density and temper ature structure at the time of ce inspiral we use mesa for this task 2 construct a model for the accretion rate evolution we use the mr 15 model for the accretion rate as a function of the background density gradient 3 construct a model for the orbital evolution we take the orbital decay to be driven entirely by local gravitational drag as computed using the mr 15 model 4 integrate the orbital evolution equation until the energy dissipated in the envelope is equal to the binding energy of the envelope for a given choice of ce 5 construct a model for gw emission from the spinning ns the strain amplitude 0 is computed using the ns spin frequency and the ns quadrupole momentq we describe the details of our model in 5 5 and 5 6 5 1 primary stellar model we compute the single star evolution of a 12 m and a 20 m primary with solar metallicity using the mesa stel lar evolution code version 8845 paxton et al 2011 2013 2015 we consider ce phases occurring at two different evolutionary stages at the base and the tip of the red gi ant branch rgb due to mass loss the precise donor star masses used are slighly smaller than their zero age main se quence zams values 3 during the inspiral the primary s structure is taken to be fixed as pointed out by mr 15 this approximation is most reasonable for large binarymass ratios the density profiles and non dimensional density gradients of our stellar models are shown in figure 1 a density inver sion appears near the surface of the stellar models because of the interaction of the iron opacity bump with the nearly eddington radiative flux in the envelope this produces a spike in 3 d radiation hydrodynamics simulations jiang et al 2015 show that in low density regions such inversions develop a porous structure that allows radiative and convec tive energy transport to compete expanding the envelope and partially eliminating the inversion in our calculations the presence of the inversion does not matter significantly for the gw prediction given the present uncertainty regarding how to properly treat such inversions in 1 d stellar evolution codes we have chosen to leave the inversion unmodified in this pa per 5 2 accretion rate model 3 mesa inlists and the model profiles used in this paper will be made available through the mesa

figure 2 note that in the region of the den sity inversion the drag is significantly enhanced while the ac cretion rate is significantly diminished relative to the hl pre diction hence including the inversion in the primary model causes the ns to pass through this region rapidly without emitting much gw energy in some respects this mimics the effect of the initial dynamical plunge seen in 3 d ce simula tions which we do not explicitly include 5 3 accretion rate parametrization accretion onto the ns during the ce phase is a fairly un certain process and the wind tunnel model for the orbital evolution may not work well in our case since the primary star structure may respond to the orbiting ns to consider the possibility that the accretion rate is diminished even fur ther below the mr 15

b and a obeys equation 26 we use the parameter to char acterize how the orbital decay of the ns evolves within the ce and describe its features as follows the limit of 1 corresponds to a slow migration where the inspiral occurs over many orbital periods the range 1 corresponds to a merger within an orbital period i e a moderate inspiral the limit of 1 corresponds to a merger on a timescale much shorter than the orbital period i e a rapid inspiral in terms of ce evolution the plunge in phase may be characterized by 1 increasing to 1 followed by the self regulated phase where 1 since we are treating the ce inspiral as quasi circular cases where 1 indicate a breakdown in the validity of this assumption 5 5 spinning ns model to self consistently determine the equatorial radius given the ns spin we adopt the same approach as pt 12 we treat the ns as an axisymmetric maclaurin spheroid and take any internal viscous dissipation to be negligible since it operates on timescales several orders of magnitude longer than dissi pation via gw radiation the gw emission then reacts im mediately to changes in the accretion rate the ns spin is parametrized using the spin parameter t w where t is the rotational kinetic energy andw is the gravitational potential energy from the maclaurin spheroid model the spin parameter can be expressed in terms of the ns ellipticity as 3 2 e 2 1 e 1 e 2 1

bildsten 1998 at mev temperatures relevant to hyper critical accre tion the outer crust melts into ocean which erases surface deformations that were previously present the lower layers may still have surface deformations and continue to generate gws before melting away once the entire crust melts then there is no gw emission from the ns for the rest of the ce evolution in this scenario we expect there to be gw emis sion as long as the crust melting timescale is longer than the ce inspiral timescale physically the local crust melting rate depends on a number of factors including the composition density etc which are uncertain as a conservative assump tion we take the accretion rate as a bound on the crust melting rate which sets the crust melting timescale to melt mcr m 39 a lower crust melting rate would be advantageous as it would allow for the ns crust to remain present on a longer timescale thus allowing for more gw emission to occur during the ce inspiral we

strain am plitude as functions of time by integrating equation 26 the resulting evolution for the 12 m and 20 m models is shown in figures 4 and 5 in all cases we find that the accreted mass panel e in fig ures 4 and 5 is less than 0 1 m at the end of the integra tion consistent with mr 15 thus the ns does not accrete enough mass to collapse into a bh however for both initial masses the inspiral behavior panel a is strikingly different for stars at different evolutionary stages for donors at the tip of the rgb the ns appears to end the inspiral at a finite sep aration with increasing however for donors at the base of the rgb the ns undergoes a rapid plunge upon reaching the termination criterion suggesting that these systems will merge and form thorne zytkow objects in these cases the accretion rate increases rapidly at the end of the inspiral we have tested the sensitivity of this result to numerical effects by carrying out the integrations with 1 10 the timestep and integrating past the termination criterion finding that the be havior is unchanged careful comparison with the model profiles figure 1 sug gests that the more evolved stars avoid merger because they reach the termination criterion before the ns reaches the hy drogen burning shell where displays a discontinuity al though reaching a burning shell should violate the assumption that the donor profile is static and the final plunge certainly violates the quasi circular orbit assumption the response of the star at this point might be to expand and thus further in crease the drag however note from panel d that

that the quasi circular approximation is at least self consistent for these cases the strain amplitude panel h is typically louder than an eddington limited ns particularly for the merger cases im plying that ns ce systems can potentially be louder sources of gws than lmxbs this also implies that ns ce sys tems may potentially be detected out to greater distances than galactic lmxbs which we discuss in more detail in section 7 3 since the accretion rate monotonically increases over the course of the inspiral see panel c of figures 4 and 5 the strain amplitude also increases with time but experiences a turn over as a significant amount of crust has melted for the more evolved stars it levels off at 3 10 its initial value while for the less evolved stars whichmerge the strain ampli tude increases by another factor of 3 10 over a timescale of less than a year the loudest ns ce systems should therefore be the ones with more compact less evolved donors merg ing and non merging cases can be distinguished based on the sign of the second time derivative of the strain amplitude reducing the accretion efficiency below 1 0 can cause the accretion rate to fall within the region of unstable cool ing solutions found by houck chevalier 1991 this is seen in the 0 1 models the accretion rates during those periods are thus modulated by the eddington limit making the system no louder than a lmxb the gravitational drag decreases when the accretion rate is reduced resulting in a longer inspiral timescale thus the 0 1 models have an inspiral duration 10 times longer than for 1 we tabu late

as long as there exists a significant amount of crust smaller ac cretion torques produce a slower spin up such that the wave form may be relatively continuous over an integration time of 10 hr our models do not reach secular instability 7 discussion 7 1 constraining the orbital separation the orbital separation at any point during ce evolution would be difficult to measure with electromagnetic observa tions due to the high optical depth of the envelope direct detection of a gw signal from an accreting ns within the ce may provide the only way to constrain the orbital separa tion between the ns and the primary s core during the inspi ral however since this constraint relies on knowledge of the primary mass and evolutionary state the ns mass and the distance to the system pre ce electromagnetic observations would be needed to obtain useful constraints the orbital separation can be constrained as follows we estimate the accretion rate from the gw strain amplitude us ing equations 16 and 19 from the accretion rate the back ground density gradient can be computed via equations 22 41 the accretion rate as a function of the strain ampli tude is plotted in panel a of figure 6 during the earlier portions of the inspiral when a majority of the crust remains higher strain amplitudes imply higher accretion rates while the functional form of the mr 15 model admits multiple solu tions for given m our forward integrationwith an assumed stellar model selects the correct one using the data from pan els b and h of figures 4 and 5 we plot in the top panel of fig ure 6 the non dimensional density gradient as a function of the strain amplitude relative to the strain amplitude for the ns at its eddington limit the ns mass and the distance are used to compute 0 edd here time is implicitly a parameter in this plot and since the strain amplitude increases mono tonically with time both increase from left to right because of the early steep drop in for a given fixed uncertainty in 0 0 edd the best constraints should be obtained later in the evolution where is smaller assuming a stellar model for the primary the orbital sepa ration can be constrained from the dimensionless density gra dient figure 7 shows the dependence of a on clearly a is most sensitive to where is better determined from 0 0 edd note that while the connection between 0 0 edd and depends on the value of the dependence of a on comes from the stellar model only we also plot a as a func tion of the strain amplitude in the middle panel of figure 6 where higher strain amplitudes correspond to lower orbital separations for all of our models we list final values of strain amplitude density gradient and separation for our models in table 3 since the stars at the base of the rgb appear to undergo merger the final sepa ration in these cases is relatively insensitive to the mass of the primary and for more evolved stars the dependence on is essentially undetectable but changing the mass from 12 to 20 m increases the final separation by a factor of 4 3 and de creases the strain amplitude by about 40 hence while this technique could be used to measure the amount of ce inspi ral successful applicationwill require some type of constraint on the primary mass 7 2 constraining the orbital decay rate as we have seen the inspiral parameter is a measure of how rapid the inspiral is compared to the orbital period a measurement of this parameter would provide information about the ce drag mechanism as well as the envelope struc ture this is another area in which electromagnetic observa tions can give us very little information during the ce phase but combining pre ce electromagnetic constraints with the gw emission during common envelope can potentially dis tinguish between plunging and non plunging scenarios estimating requires an estimate of a 7 1 to determine the orbital period orb and an estimate of a to determine the inspiral timescale ins in both cases we first obtain from 0 0 edd as described in the previous section we then use equation 25 to determine the drag force and equations 26 28 to compute a as with the accretion rate the func tional form of the mr 15 drag force model allows multiple solutions for but an assumed stellar model lets us choose the correct one the inspiral parameter is plotted as a func tion of the strain amplitude in panel d of figure 6 as a func tion of in the bottom panel of figure 7 and as a function of orbital separation in figure 8 we also tabulate values at the end of the inspiral in table 3 as expected from the orbital evolution the final orbital decay rates for the models at the base of the rgb are greater in magnitude than for the more evolved models however the final inspiral parameter values are smaller at the tip of the rgb though they are still greater than 1 at face value this seems inconsistent with the appar ent merging behavior of the less evolved primaries however is more rapidly increasing for the more evolved cases if the integration is carried beyond the termination criterion con tinues to increase while for the stars at the base of the rgb it drops sharply as previously mentioned reducing the accretion rate in creases the inspiral timescale which increases as seen in the 0 1 models relative to the 1 models reduc ing the accretion rate also reduces the strain amplitude which shifts the model curves to the left in the 0 plane early in the orbital evolution 1 and the quasi circular approx imation is invalid we have noted that this is due to uncer tainties in the outer envelope structure during the middle stages of evolution where these uncertainties begin to affect 14 holgado et al table 3 model quantities at the final timestep model 0 f 0 edd f 2 hz m f m yr 1 f

parameter depends weakly on the strain amplitude however at the end where the evolution resolves into stabilization as a close binary or merger undergoes a sharp uptick in the non merger cases this is particularly pro nounced while in the merger cases it is followed by a sharp drop when integrating past the termination criterion this be havior is nearly independent of this abrupt change in be havior offers a model dependent way to distinguish the two scenarios 7 3 detecting ns ce systems with gravitational waves any accreting spinning ns with an asymmetry with re spect to its rotation axis is a gw source that may be detectable in the aligo band in figure 9 we compare the gw emission properties of ns ce systems from models m 3 and m 7 with lmxbs accreting at the eddington limit nss undergoing fallback accretion in supernovae a subsample of strain ratio upper limits from meadors et al 2017 and expected strain ratio upper limits for aligo assuming a source distance of 2 8 kpc as we have seen even when the density gradient is steep and we make conservative assumptions about the accre tion efficiency ns ce systems can be about 10 times louder than lmxbs like sco x 1 however fallback accretion rates have been estimated to be m fall 10 4 10 2 m s 1 over a timescale of 102 s macfadyen et al 2001 zhang et al 2008 pt 12 such accretion rates can exert an accre tion torque large enough to spin up the ns up to the point of secular instability sec thus fallback accreting systems should be up to 103 4 times louder than ns ce systems their characteristic frequencies should reach higher values than for x ray binaries but may overlap the binary range be fore reaching secular instability however since the ns ce systems have a gw modulation timescale ranging from 1 month 100 yr it should be easy to distinguish them from fallback accretion events for the aligo design sensitivity curve we have taken a coherent integration time of coh 30 hr similar to what the einstein home uses for their continuous gw searches e g ligo scientific collaboration et al 2009 abbott et al 2016 the coherence time is for an individual frequency such thatn continuous waveform searches within a given in terval of the aligo band results in a total integration time of n coh if we use its value in the range of frequencies relevant to x ray binaries hyper accreting ns ce systems should almost be detectable at 2 8 kpc once aligo achieves design sensitivity and the loudest merging ns ce systems may already be detectable at ten times this distance if the ns has achieved the maximum quadrupole moment that it can sustain the maximum distance at which ns ce systems would have strain amplitudes comparable to sco x 1 can be estimated as d 62 kpc 0 3 5 10 26 1 p 1 4 ms 2 qmax 2 1039 g cm 2 42 thus by the time sco x 1 becomes detectable via gravita tional waves hyper accreting ns ce systems with 1 ms ns spin periods should be detectable as far away as the mag ellanic clouds ns ce systems with larger ns spin periods may be detectable onlywithin thegalaxy for example a ns spin period of 4 ms would only be detectable to 8 kpc i e the galactic center 8 conclusions in this paper we have shown that accreting neutron stars undergoing common envelope inspiral may be gravitational wave sources detectable in the aligo band as far away as the magellanic clouds to characterize the evolution of ns ce systems we performed orbital integrations using 12 m and 20 m primaries produced with mesa treating the accre tion onto the ns with the mr 15 model using the maclaurin spheroid model to estimate the spin evolution of the ns and a quadrupole moment model to account for melting of the ns crust during the inspiral from the range of possible accretion rates relevant to ce evolution we find that ns ce systems may be significantly louder gw sources than lmxbs like sco x 1 which are currently the target of directed searches for continuous gws we also find that the measured gw strain amplitude of the accreting ns may allow for novel con gravitational waves from accreting neutron stars in common envelopes 15 10 8 10 6 10 4 10 2 100 a cc re tio n ra te m m yr 1 a

plot modelm 7 as the blue line with triangle markers and modelm 3 as the red line with square markers our strain amplitude estimates should be regarded as up per limits however the threshold for hyper critical accre tion yields a strain amplitude that should be detectable with aligo to distances as large as 62 kpc at 1 ms spin peri ods once sco x 1 becomes detectable thus there is potential for extragalactic ns ce sources to be detected and character ized with aligo in the absence of such detections we would have to conclude that the accretion may be melting the crust before gw amplitude increases to a detectable level or the rate of ns ce events per galaxy is low in a future paper we will examine further using 3 d simula tions some of the assumptions we have adopted here in par ticular plunging phases of ce evolution may produce rapid changes in the gw signal relative to the integration time that may prove useful as diagnostic features the final separation and the condition that defines it are not well determined yet but it clearly plays an important role in setting the maximum gw luminosity of ns ce systems in stars for which the ther mal adjustment and dynamical timescales are not too dissim ilar such as the massive stars considered here the response of the primary to the inspiral cannot be neglected and may determine the final separation and thus maximum gw lumi nosity finally uncertainties in the outer envelope structure clearly matter in the early phases of ns ce evolution with massive primaries and further improvements can be sought in this area we

bildsten cumming 1998 the mass accretion rate is balanced by the electron capture rate for a given target nuclei in a steady state by m dx dy xrec a 1 where m is the mass accretion rate per unit area x is the concentration of the target nuclei and y z dz at the eddington accretion rate the mass accretion rate per unit area is m edd empc trns 7 5 104 e rns 10 km g cm 2 s 1 a 2 where e is the mean molecular weight per electron and mp is the mass of the proton we re express the above equation in terms of the crust depth x 1 dx x z 0 rec m z dz a 3 the density jump across the electron capture layer is of order 10 ushomirsky et al 2000 e g so we take an average density z 0 z dz z solving for the thickness of the electron capture layer we obtain z m ln x rec a 4 the height of mountains generated by electron captures is of order the electron capture layer and has an implicit temperature dependence z z t t a 5 where the temperature variation t t x x a 6 may arise from local asymmetric accretion flow buried magnetic fields local compositional variation etc taking the temperature derivative of eq a 4 we obtain z t m ln x r 2 ec rec t a 7 from expressions a 5 a 7 lateral temperature gradients on the ns surface along with the temperature dependence of the electron capture rates produces mountains with height z as long as these mountains are unaligned with the ns spin axis the generated quadrupole moment is q i a b 1 2 a b 1 5 mns a 2 b 2 a 8 where a rns 1 2 z a 9 a b rns 1 2 z a 9 b the ellipticity is z rns a 10 and evaluating the mass quadrupole moment q i z rns 1 5 mns rns 1 2 z 2 rns 1 2 z 2 a 11 20 holgado et al and taking z rns we ignore terms that are z 2 such that q reduces to q i 2 5 mnsrns z a 12 we plug in the expression for z eq a 5 to obtain q 2 5 mnsrns z t t a 13 we rearrange to get z t 5 q 2 mnsrns t a 14 we then plug in eq a 7 to obtain the required temperature dependence of the electron capture rate for a desired quadrupole moment q 0 rec t r 2 ec m ln x 5 q 0 2 mrns t a 15 if the left hand side of the above expression is less than the right hand side then the generated quadrupole moment is less than the desired one q q 0 for the hypercritical regime we consider a target nuclei of 56 niwithrec and rec t obtained from nabi rahman 2005 a remaining concentration x 0 1 m 104 m edd q 0 4 1039 g cm 2 t 1010 k 109 g cm 3 and t 0 01 t we find that eq a 15 is satisfied which suggests that electron captures may be a relevant mechanism for generating gw emission for ns ce events evaluating eq a 15 for the eddington case with hydrogen and using rec and rec t from bildsten cumming 1998 m m edd t 109 k 107 g cm 3 and other values the same as the previous case eq a 15 is satisfied
