forming regions cnsfrs have been studied in different frequencies and telescopes diverse studies about connection between nuclear activity and star formation in the cnsfrs were doing using optical data ifs and models we obtain data of the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 1068 at j band between 1 35 1 32 using the 8 1 m gemini telescope and gnirs ifu mode we found the radial velocity and intensity maps for feii 12570 pa 12814 and feii 13201 lines of all the components the gas emission has a double origin associated with photoionization by young stars or excitation by collisions we found a high influence of shocks produced by the jet the intensity of pa emission show that this component is ionized by a younger cluster or more massive stars from the analysis of the velocity fields the data related with the component one of pa are consistent with the presence of rotation which is displaced from the maximum continuous our observations may point to the presence of a bar key words galaxies agn galaxies seyfert 2 galaxies maps galaxies ngc 1068 1 introduction the circumnuclear star forming regions cnsfrs with sizes until hundred of parsecs diaz 2000 are constituted by several hii regions ionized by compact and bright stellar clouds using stellar velocity dispersions 39 67 km s the previous authors de rived the dynamic masses for the complete stellar formation com plex and the individual stellar clouds with masses from 4 9 x 106 mo to 4 3 x 107 mo there is evidence of the presence of at least two different ion ized kinematic gas components in the regions the narrow compo nent provided by setting two gaussian components seems to have a relatively constant value for all cnsfrs studied with an average of 23 km s this narrow component could be identified with ionized gas on a rotating disc while the stars and the gas fraction respon sible for the wide component seem more related to the regions of star formation furthermore diaz 2000 have investigated the possible con nection between nuclear activity and star formation in circumnu clear galaxies cnsfrs with variable degrees of nuclear activity concluding that there is no relationship in the formation of stars and the region of nuclear activity caused by remnants of super novae with gas and radiation expelled from the active nucleus dors e mail astrojupiter 62 hotmail com 2008 combined optical ifs data integral field unit gemini and models to determine the abundance of gas and star forming rate on the cnsfrs of two active galaxies ngc 1097 and ngc 6951 riffel 2008 and riffel 2010 using slicers inside gem ini near infrared nifs and gnirs in the ifu mode studied the agn starburst connection and kinematics of gas in galaxies ngc 4051 active and ngc 7582 respectively they concluded that there are two forms of connection first molecular gas leads to the formation of stars in the circumnuclear region second the molec ular gas is formed in the circumnuclear star formation region the galaxy ngc 1068 has been long considered as the proto type seyfert 2 galaxy but it shows wide components lines fwhm of the order of 3500 km s typical emission lines of seyfert 1 when its spectrum is obtained in polarized light antonuccimiller 1985 antonucci 1993 but part of the unpolarized light reaching the ob server has been absorbed by the toroid it has also been classified morphologically as a spiral galaxy of type sab it has angular size of 7 1 x 6 it is located at a distance of 14 4 mpc ulvestad 1987 and has a redshift z 0 00379 0 00001 huchra 1999 the position of the active nuclei in far infrared is r a

that the emission is concentrated in a cone that extends to the northeast capetti 1995 colbert 2002 c 2016 the authors ar x iv 1 80 1 08 24 6 v 1 as tr o ph g a 2 5 ja n 20 18 2 villican a pedraza i

also is seen in the southwest direction in optical ultraviolet and oii but weaker a stellar bar of 2 kpc was detected in the near infrared scoville 1988 in turn surrounded by a starburst cir cumnuclear it has also been detected in molecular gas lines stern berg 1994 and continuous radio gallimore 1996 the emission of this burst added to other star formation regions contribute the or der half of the bolometric luminosity of the galaxy davies 1998 jimenezbailon 2004 optical spectroscopy made with the hst hubble space telescope showed that ngc 1068 has a region of complex coronal lines extended to hundreds of parsecs the dy namics of the molecular gas in the torus show strong non circular motions and enhanced turbulence superposed on a surprisingly slow rotation of the disk evidence suggesting that the molecular torus is less inclined garciaburillo 2016 ngc 1068 represents an ideal object to try to establish the ori gin of the different kinematics components of the gas in circumnu clear regions the aim of this work is to study the field of the veloc ities of the circumnuclear stellar formation regions and its possible connection with the active kernel of the galaxy we will map field velocities of the gas in these regions with good spatial sampling and we will separate the field velocity complexes of circumnuclear star formation to study radial velocity of different zones to under stand their effect on a possible widening of emission lines on the gas and distinguish the origin of the two components 2 observations and reduction the spectroscopic data of ngc 1068 in infrared were obtained from the database of the 8 1 m telescope gemini south with gnirs instrument in its configuration integral field spectrograph on the night of december 26 2004 the seeing that night was between 0 6 and 0 8 arcsec in the band v the instrument is set up in a posi tion angle pa 0 ie the slices are east west orientation the data analyzed in this paper were obtained with the spec trograph gnirs when the information of this work was ac quired spectrograph was on the 8 1 m telescope gemini south gnirs provides integral field spectroscopy with a spectral reso lution from r x 4800 to 1600 j band in a visual image field of 4 8 x 3 2 arcsec 2 the central wavelengths of the gratings gnirs can be adjusted reaching lengths of higher or lower wave lengths for this a network of 32 l mm is used that depending on the angle it can be adjusted from the x 1 10 m to the m band 4 80 m although generally is used in bands j h k 1 25 m to 2 20 m the ifu gnirs divides the plane of the sky into 21 slices of 0 15 arcsecs wide each six exposures of 300 second were conducted in the observed zone of ngc 1068 spectra flat screen field gcalflat and flat field of sky were also obtained twilight at exposures 2 5 sec and 30 sec respectively it has also been ob tained a spectrum of a calibration lamp arc lamp with a 1 5 sec exposure to calibrate wavelength the reduction of these data was performed using the tasks of pack gnirs of iraf called giraf in the process of reduc tion the images were prepared to cut them only if necessary with nscut flat fields were created for screen and sky nsflat the tel luric star and object of science were normalized correction of dis tortion of light nssdist identification of the lines of the lamp was made the sky was subtracted the spectra obtained in the same spot were combined the calibration was performed in wavelength nstransform finally the 2 d spectrum is extracted in a 3 d cube data nfcube the cube contains spatial information in two direc tions and information spectral on in the third the final cube con tains 651 spectra of the band j 3 measurements and results 3 1 measurements the data cube contains 651 spectra obtained on j band each spec trum obtained has been manually analyzed component by compo nent to keep valuable information that could help us understand in more detail the kinematics of ngc 1068 the spectrograph has 21 slices or mirrors we obtained 31 spectra of each in order to com plete the 651 mentioned the spectra of ngc 1068 show emission lines of hydrogen recombination pa 12814 as well as feii 12570 and feii 13201 like the optical spectrum arribas 1996 the emission lines in the infrared band show significant vari ation in their profiles with asymmetries and peaks of at least three components in many of them the maps were drawn from our measurement tables of the lines creating a script that makes an order that allows iraf to convert the information into an image that will be eventually a map the maps are in coordinates x y z where z is the value of our variable for example flux for x y subtends 0 15 arc seconds in the sky per pixel the bar that accompanies each map indicates the value of each pixel by color some of the spectra obtained in this work are shown see fig 1 note that the components of the lines are well defined pro files so characteristic of ngc 1068 the obtained flow is in counts since they are not calibrated flow i e we don t have a standard to calibrate star flow then the y axes in our spectra is the inten sity measured by not being a calibrated flow the equivalent width eqw it is the intensity of the line relative to the continuum in general as shown and mentioned above the strongest lines are pa 12814 and feii 12570 while feii 13201 although it never disappears spectra it becomes weak in most of the spectra it is noteworthy that the pa line in several spectra does not appear so could not be measured in all of them for to analyze each line with its components has been used iraf task splot program adjust ing at least two discrete components d for doublet g for gaussian fit 3 2 results in this section the results of this work show radial velocity of ma terial in each region studied flow lines and components intensity maps flow for two components of each line feii 12570 pa 12814 fwhm maps and eqw radial velocity maps location of the galactic nucleus on maps with coordinates of right ascen sion ra and declination dec understanding on behavior of the material in the study area the fwhm was disaffected of the instrumental width to de termine this we used the average of fwhm of the 10 most intense emission lines from the sky obtaining a value 182 km s the in strumental width was quadratically substacted to the fwhm values measured the line feii 13201 shows weak in most of the spectra so that the mapping velocity and fwhm of that line would show a great error and it is not very reliable mnras 000 1 6 2016 connection between cnsfrs and active nuclei in ngc 1068 3 3 2 1 feii pa ratios in the map of figure 4 can be seing the ratio of lines feii pa the ratio was made dividing the line intensities feii and of pa for its main component the ratio allows separate regions where pho toionization dominates the most common values range are from 0 5 to 2 in this map fig 4 the nuclear region marked with x has values around 2 this would imply that there dominate the shocks the sn and the winds but moving away from the region we can not say much for poor signal noise the map for the second component is not shown as values indicate little signal to noise 3 2 2 spectra settings on maps once done the maps of various line parameters of feii and pa it has been found the spectra configuration with respect to the maps the maps are mapped in 21 x 31 arrangements y axis vs x axis the scale in arcsec is 0 15 x 0 15 by spaxel square each box on the map corresponds to a spectrum 3 2 3 error analysis the error map gives us an idea of the regions that are acceptably measures for the component one of the map of pa the purple re gions are regions with errors smaller than 50 km s blue regions they range from 50 to 100 150 acceptable limit to know what is the acceptable limit according to our data we calculated the veloc ity resolution and we have if our spectrum for the line pa at 12800 approximately has a resolution on 3 85 and c the speed of light we use the equation v c 90 km s each pixel in the spectrum in figure 5 are error maps 4 discussion 4 1 intensities obtained in the maps the intensity maps that have been obtained in this work for lines feii 12570 and 12814 pa are for main components riffel 2011 have worked with the mrk 1157 galaxy observing with nifs of gemini telescope making intensity maps for the same lines feii and pa and its ratios concluding that the emission flow for feii increases due to shocks produced by the jet radio which destroys the dust grains expelling from the agn in addi tion riffel 2011 worked with ngc 7582 which keeps recent star formation with a dark region in the central region morris 1985 regan 1999 storchi 2001 sosabrito 2001 wold 2006 dust is responsible for asymmetrical contours flow maps obtained while the star formation ring is circle these clouds of star formation had not been observed in optical ir comparing with the preceding in formation and maps obtained in this study we conclude that i emissions lines are elongated in the direction of the jet ii the emis sion of flow for feii in both components is greater than for pa components which means influence of shocks produced by the jet iii more intensity in the emission of pa for component 1 would imply a ionization region of the component 1 due to a younger clus ter or where there are more massive stars that ionize the gas 4 2 fwhm from maps riffel 2010 studied ngc 7582 reporting the presence of a broad component of br line with fwhm of 4000 km s another broad figure 1 most representative spectra obtained 651 spectra which can be seen clearly three lines l of emission on that have been analyzed el spec tral range for the x axis is 12000 13000 the y axis is in accounts intensity mnras 000 1 6

event and proposed three possible scenarios for its origin i capture and breaking of a star by a supermassive black hole ii a change in the redness of the toroid surrounding the core iii an explosion of supernova type ii in this paper the map of fwhm for feii has values rang ing from 200 800 km s being the most dominant about 600 km s indicating increased gas turbulence in the area where that line is produced causing wider and deformed lines by turbulence from the maps obtained in this work we found that for pa line the fwhm obtained for component one is higher than for the component two with values ranging from 100 500 km s and 100 300 km s respectively with maximums at 300 km s and 100 km s respectively we conclude that exists more gas turbulence in this line for component 1 than in component 2 figure 3 up eqw maps of the pa 12814 line in first block at the center flux maps second block at the center fwhm maps in km s last one radial velocity maps in km s color bar indicate

eqw from maps in his study of ngc 7582 riffel 2010 found for br line an eqw of 30 and stellar formation of 5 myr dors 2008 found similar values of cnsfrs in ngc 6951 and ngc 1097 a greater eqw indicate more star formation as shown rodriguez 2010 for this paper we can see that in the case of the eqw of feii 12570 we have values from 3 30 1 in the component one centered at 3 and for the component two values are similar while in the case of eqw of pa for component one it has values from 1 6 and for the component two it has values dominated for 1 2 because the component 1 shows an eqw of pa bigger we can estimate that this component would occur in an area with more recent star formation or abundant 4 4 ratio lines the map obtained can observe the ratio of the lines feii pa the ratio allows separating regions where photoionization and shock re gions dominate the most common values are 0 5 to 2 in this map mnras 000 1 6 2016 connection between cnsfrs and active nuclei in ngc 1068 5 figure 4 ratio map of intensity of feii pa using the principal component of each line respectively orientation of the map is north up and east left the nuclear region marked with x has values around 2 this im plies that there dominate the shocks the sn and the winds but moving away from the region we can not say much because poor signal noise the map for the second component is not shown be cause the values indicate little signal to noise and higher errors 4 5 radial velocity and dispersion velocity the optical spectra of the nuclear region show clear signs of middle aged stars cid fernandes 2002 about the kinematics of gas the blue shift could be due to an inflow if the gas is located in the plane or a outflow if the gas is extended at high latitudes above the plane conical structure facing us riffel 2010 studied ngc 7582 the radial velocity field shows a blue shift toward se and a redshift nw suggesting rotation although the kinematic center is shifted from the continuous emission peak they concluded that the stellar velocity field shows distorted rotation which is offset relative to the core 50 pc continuous peak the distortion may be due to a bar in the nucleus in this work the velocity for the two compo nents are of 1200 km and 600 km s for the line feii while for the line pa we have 1150 km s and 700 km s in the work of mazza lay 2010 ngc 1068 was studied with nifs at 1 15 1 3 microns but it was not adjust each of the lines of interest manually it built codes to analyze them losing valuable kinematics information from different components riffel 2010 studied ngc 1066 with nifs 1 10 1 35 microns to obtain a very similar to that presented in this paper gnirs but adjustments the same lines without considering the components losing kinematics information of the galaxy 5 conclusions in this paper 651 spectra were obtained from ngc 1068 between 1 25 1 32 microns in these spectra have being identified the most important emission lines feii 12570 pa 12814 and feii 13201 for each of the lines it has made an adjustment of multicom ponent obtaining up to five components to the same line in some spectra which in this work only the two most important were pre sented and mapped feii 12570 pa 12814 being obtained the velocity field the information obtained for the observed distribution of flow in the two mapped components has shown that the emission gas in each has a double origin it has being associated with photoioniza tion by young stars or excitation by collisions the nuclear emis figure 5 error maps for radial velocity on the superior part are the error maps for feii inferior part the corresponding maps to the pa line the maps are show for two components the first at left and second at right the color bar represents the error value km s to get error maps we use the keel formula 1996 sion for feii in both components is greater than pa which means a high influence of shocks produced by the jet moreover the emis sion intensity of the pa line is high for the component 1 which imply that this component is ionized by a younger cluster or there are more massive stars the map fwhm for feii has higher val ues for component 1 indicating greater gas turbulence in the zone where the line is measured causing deformed wider lines by turbu lence for pa line the fwhm obtained for component 1 is greater than for the component 2 we conclude that for this line there is greater gas turbulence shown in componte 1 than component 2 we obtained for the case of eqw of feii 12570 similar data values for the two components show slightly lower in the com ponent 2 for the component two of the pa line values shown slightly lower than for the component 1 because the component 1 shows a greater eqw of pa we can estimate that it would occur in mnras 000 1 6 2016 6 villican a pedraza i et al an area with more recent star formation or abundant on the map shown marked with x the nuclear region has values around 2 this would imply that the shocks the sn and the winds dominate there but moving away from this area we can not say much due to poor signal to noise and greater errors the map for the second compo nent is not shown because values indicate very low signal to noise ratio and increased errors finally from the analysis of the velocity field is obtained that the component one of feii line is for greater than component 2 in the same way the velocity is higher in component one than com ponent two for pa line the data relating to the component 1 are consistent with the presence of rotation however it is hard to dis tinguish this effect produced by a jet in the event that the rotation is displaced from the maximum continuous our observations may point to the presence of a bar
