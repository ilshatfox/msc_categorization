astronomical observatory russian academy of sciences pulkovskoe sh 65 st petersburg 196140 russia abstract we consider 36 candidates for close within 1 pc encounters with the solar system these stars have been selected in accordance with the results of an analysis of their motion obtained by various authors for most stars from this list the kinematic character istics have been taken from the gaia dr 2 catalogue the parameters of the encounters of these stars with the solar system have been calculated using three methods 1 the linear one 2 the epicyclic one and 3 by integrating the orbits in an axisymmetric potential we have concluded that the epicyclic method works quite well only on a time interval no longer than 1 myr based on the third method in good agreement with the first method for the first time we have obtained the following estimates of the encounter parameters for the star gaia dr 2 3130033734235815424 tmin 0 62 0 12 myr and dmin 0 30 0 10 pc introduction the interest in close within 1 2 pc encounters of field stars with the solar system stems from the fact that the so called comet shower from the outer boundaries of the oort cloud oort 1950 toward the major planets and in particular the earth can emerge as simulations show dybczyn ski 2002 2005 martinez barbosa et al 2017 apart from stellar flybys the oort comet cloud is subject to perturbations from giant molecular clouds and experiences an effect from the galaxy s attraction a practical search for close stellar encounters with the solar system was carried out for example by revina 1988 matthews 1994 and mu lla ri and orlov 1996 the then used ground based catalogues were not distinguished by a high accuracy of stellar parallaxes and proper motions nevertheless thanks to these authors some candidates were revealed which were subsequently confirmed by more accurate data these include for example proxima centauri the centauri system or the star gj 905 based on data from the hipparcos 1997 catalogue this problem was solved by garcia sa nchez et al 1999 2001 bobylev 2010 a 2010 b anderson and francis 2012 dy bczyn ski and berski 2015 bailer jones 2015 and feng and bailer jones 2015 based on data from the gaia catalogue prusti et al 2016 its first release gaia tgas tycho gaia astrometric solution lindegren et al 2016 the search for close encounters was conducted by berski and dybczyn ski 2016 bobylev and bajkova 2017 and r de la fuente marcos and c de la fuente marcos 2018 several candidates for a very close flyby namely for an injection into the oort cloud to distances less than 0 5 pc were detected as 1 e mail vbobylev gaoran ru 1 http arxiv org abs 2006 16555 v 1 a result of these efforts the record holder is the star gj 710 garcia sa nchez et al 2001 bobylev 2010 a berski and dybczyn ski 2016 bailer jones 2018 another example is the low mass m 9 5 t 5 binary system wise j 072003 20 084651 2 detected by mamajek et al 2015 finally based on even more accurate gaia dr 2 data brown et al 2018 lindegren et al 2018 such an analysis was performed for example by bailer jones et al 2018 darma et al 2019 torres et al 2019 and wysoczan ska et al 2020 as a result we have 3000 candidates 30 stars and 5 6 stars can have encounters with the solar system within 5 1 and 0 25 pc respectively on a time interval of 5 myr in particular wysoczan ska et al 2020 found the star als 9243 that could approach the solar orbit to a distance of 0 25 pc 2 5 myr ago while the record holder star gj 710 according to the estimate by bailer jones et al 2018 may approach the solar system to a distance of 0 05 pc in 1 2 myr stellar trajectories are constructed by various methods the following ones are commonly applied i the linear method ii the epicyclic approximation or iii using an appropriate model galactic gravitational potential large more than 1 pc discrepancies between the results of an analysis of the encounter parameters for als 9243 wysoczan ska et al 2020 and several more stars from darma et al 2019 that we got by applying various approaches served as a stimulus for writing this paper the goal of our paper is to use these three methods to analyze 30 stars that according to various authors have encounters with the solar system within 1 pc in our opinion such a work is topical in the runup to the release of the gaia dr 3 catalogue orbit construction methods in a rectangular coordinate system with the center in the sun the x axis is directed toward the galactic center the y axis is in the direction of galactic rotation and the z axis is directed to the north galactic pole then x r cos l cos b y r sin l cos b and z r sin b where r 1 is the stellar heliocentric distance in kpc that we calculate via the stellar parallax in mas note that in this paper we use stars with relative parallax errors less than 10 and therefore there is no need to take into account the lutz kelker bias lutz and kelker 1973 the line of sight velocity vr and the two tangential velocity components vl 4 74 r l cos b and vb 4 74 r b along the galactic longitude l and latitude b respectively expressed in km s 1 are known from observations here the coefficient 4 74 is the ratio of the number of kilometers in an astronomical unit to the number of seconds in a tropical year the proper motion components l cos b and b are expressed in mas yr 1 the velocities u v and w where u is directed away from the sun toward the galactic center v is in the direction of galactic rotation and w is directed to the north galactic pole are calculated via the components vr vl and vb respectively u vr cos l cos b vl sin l vb cos l sin b v vr sin l cos b vl cos l vb sin l sin b w vr sin b vb cos b 1 we use three methods to analyze the close encounters of field stars with the solar system the first method is based on the linear approximation the second method consists in ana lyzing the epicyclic orbits of stars and in the third method the stellar and solar orbits are constructed using an axisymmetric model galactic gravitational potential 2 linear method according to matthews 1994 the minimum distance between the stellar and solar trajec tories dmin at the encounter time tmin can be found from the following relations dmin r 1 vr vt 2 tmin rvr v 2 t v 2 r 2 where vt v 2 l v 2 b is the stellar velocity perpendicular to the line of sight epicyclic approximation the epicyclic approximation lindblad 1927 allows the orbits of stars to be constructed in a coordinate system rotating around the galactic center we apply the method in the form given by fuchs et al 2006 x t x 0 u

constants 4 0 b is the epicyclic frequency 0 is the angular velocity of the galactic rotation of the local standard of rest 0 a b 4 g 0 is the vertical oscillation frequency where g is the gravitational constant and 0 is the stellar density in the solar neighborhood the parameters x 0 y 0 z 0 and u 0 v 0 w 0 in the system of equations 3 denote the current stellar positions and velocities the sun s height above the galactic plane is taken to be h 16 pc bobylev and bajkova 2016 a we calculate the velocities u v and w relative to the local standard of rest using u v w 11 1 12 2 7 3 km s 1 from scho nrich et al 2010 we adopted 0 0 1 m pc 3 holmberg and flinn 2004 which gives 74 km s 1 kpc 1 the following oort constants close to their present day estimates are used a 18 5 km s 1 kpc 1 and b 11 0 km s 1 kpc 1 rastorguev et al 2017 note that we neglect the star sun gravitational interaction for each star we calculate the encounter parameter between the stellar and solar orbits d t x 2 t y 2 t z 2 t next we determine dmin at the encounter time tmin from these data model gravitational potential the axisymmetric galactic potential is represented as a sum of three components a central spherical bulge b r r z a disk d r r z and a massive spherical dark matter halo h r r z r z b r r z d r r z h r r z 4 here we use a cylindrical coordinate system r z with the coordinate origin at the galactic center in a rectangular coordinate system x y z the distance to a star spherical 3 table 1 parameters of the model galactic potential from bajkova and bobylev 2016 b

with the x axis being directed away from the sun toward the galactic center the y axis being perpendicular to the x axis in the direction of galactic rotation and the z axis being perpendicular to the

within 200 kpc in this model is m 200 0 75 0 19 1012 m the equations of motion for a test particle in a galactic potential appear as follows x px y py z pz p x x p y y p z z 8 wherepx py pz are the canonical momenta the dot denotes a time derivative the fourth order runge kutta algorithm was used to integrate eqs 8 4 in the rectangular galactic coordinate system the initial test particle

velocities in the heliocentric coordinate system and the circular rotation velocity of the solar neighborhood in our potential is vcirc 244 km s 1 as above for each star we calculate the encounter parameter between the stellar and solar orbits d t x 2 t y 2 t z 2 t then we determine dmin at the encounter time tmin we estimate the errors in dmin and tmin by the monte carlo method here the errors in the stellar parameters are assumed to be distributed normally with a dispersion the errors are added to the equatorial coordinates proper motion components parallaxes and line of sight velocities of the stars data such input data on our 36 stars as the trigonometric parallaxes proper motion components and line of sight velocities are given in table 2 the sample was produced as follows 1 from table 2 in bailer jones et al 2018 we took 26 stars that approach the solar system within 1 pc on the time interval from 3 to 3 myr 2 we added the star als 9243 to the list of candidates based on the analysis by wysoczan ska et al 2020 3 the low mass binary star wise j 072003 20 084651 2 ab scholz s star was first revealed as an interesting candidate for close encounters by mamajek et al 2015 it

parameter differences results and discussion table 3 gives the parameters of the stellar encounters with the solar system found by three methods i the linear one 2 ii the epicyclic one 3 and iii by integrating the orbits in the axisymmetric potential 4 the last column gives the errors in the parameters they can be attributed to all three methods estimated by the monte carlo method as can be seen from table 3 there is excellent agreement between the encounter param eters found by the first and third methods in contrast the estimates of the parameters obtained by the epicyclic method occasionally have very strong deviations from those found by the two other methods a correlation of the deviations with the integration period is also easily seen on a time interval longer than 1 myr the epicyclic method works poorly based on the data from table 3 we calculated the encounter parameter differences of the following three types method 1 minus method 2 method 2 minus method 3 and method 1 minus method 3 figure 1 presents the histograms constructed from these differences on all three left panels a c and e the scale of the horizontal axis tmin is the same it can be easily seen that the method 1 minus method 3 differences have the smallest dispersion on panels b and d the scale of the horizontal axis dmin exceeds the scale of panel f by an order of magnitude such long tails of the distributions on panels b and d arose due to the epicyclic method we may conclude that the encounter parameters found by methods 1 and 3 are in good agreement between themselves the strategy of searching for close encounters in which the linear method is applied at the first searching stage and the method of orbit integration 10 in a potential is applied at the second more detailed stage is quite justified for example bailer jones 2015 adhered to this strategy the model potential can be very complex and contain nonaxisymmetric components that take into account the contributions of the spiral density wave or the central bulge see e g garcia sa nchez et al 2001 for the two lower histograms in fig 1 e and f we obtained the following values of the mean and its error tmin 0 001 0 005 myr and dmin 0 037 0 125 pc the error of each of these methods will then be a factor of 2 smaller tmin 0 003 myr and dmin 0 09 pc these values are smaller than the mean errors due to the contribution of measurement errors for example the following mean measurement errors were found from the data in the last two columns of table 3 t 0 085 myr and d 0 168 pc note that the encounter parameters found by us by the first and third methods are in agreement with those from bailer jones et al 2018 we established this from 26 common stars for this purpose we calculated the method 1 minus bailer jones and method 3 minus bailer jones parameter differences the results are given in table 4 our model potential differs from that of bailer jones 2015 by expression 7 for the halo in addition there are differing parameters for the coincident halo and disk expressions table 1 nevertheless the method 3 minus bailer jones differences both tmin and dmin are small three or four stars for example gaia dr 2 3458393840965496960 represent an exception there is also an example of a significant decrease in the differences dmin in the case of applying the third method compared to the first method the star gaia dr 2 6608946489396474752 the histograms constructed from the method 1 minus bailer jones and method 3 minus bailer jones encounter parameter differences are presented in fig 2 the following values of the mean and its error were obtained for the method 1 minus bailer jones differences tmin 0 002 0 066 myr and dmin 0 162 0 141 pc the following values of the mean and its error were obtained for the method 3 minus bailer jones differences tmin 0 069 0 070 myr and dmin 0 103 0 124 pc here three large outliers were discarded when estimating tmin and its dispersion on the whole we may conclude that our method 3 is in slightly better agreement with the bailer jones approach than with the linear one more specifically 1 it can be seen from table 3 that for the star als 9243 there is good agreement between the three methods in determining the encounter time tmin 2 3 myr the epicyclic approach in estimating the distance dmin is in poor agreement with the other methods on the whole we can confirm the conclusion by wysoczan ska et al 2020 that the star als 9243 is an interesting candidate for very close encounters with the solar system in fact it is a candidate for a passage in the past through much of the oort cloud 2 based on the linear method dupuy et al 2019 obtained the following estimates of the encounter parameters for the star wise j 072003 20 084651 2 ab tmin 0 081 0 001 myr and dmin 0 333 0 010 pc our third method gives similar values tmin 0 083 0 001 myr and dmin 0 370 0 012 pc while using the linear method as can be seen from table 3 we found parameters virtually coincident with those from dupuy et al 2009 3 darma et al 2019 obtained the estimates of tmin 0 48 0 05 myr and dmin 0 58 0 11 pc for the star gaia dr 2 52952724810126208 designated there as id 298 by integrating the orbits in an axisymmetric potential according to our solution found by the third method we have tmin 0 553 0 060 myr and dmin 0 205 0 086 pc thus these results are in good agreement between themselves the line of sight velocity of this star was 11 taken from the gaia dr 2 catalogue where teff 6500 k and log g 3 5 cm s 2 are also given for this star while its spectral type f 0 is given in the lamost dr 4 catalogue luo et al 2018 for the star gaia dr 2 3130033734235815424 designated there as id 291 darma et al 2019 found tmin 0 49 0 05 myr and dmin 1 56 0 21 pc our method in agreement with the linear one yields a completely different result tmin 0 620 0 116 myr and dmin 0 299 0 096 pc here we see poor agreement with the results from darma et al 2019 erroneous encounter parameters for this star are apparently given in darma et al 2019 note that its line of sight velocity was taken from the lamost dr 4 catalogue luo et al 2018 since the line of sight velocity has not been known previously the star is of great interest for our problem the following parameters are also given there for this star spectral type f 0 teff 7150 k and log g 3 948 cm s 2 we may conclude that two stars of spectral type f 0 gaia dr 2 52952724810126208 and gaia dr 2 3130033734235815424 are of great interest as candidates for close encounters with the solar system each of them has a significant mass and therefore their passage through the oort cloud could produce noticeable perturbations of the comet cloud the encounter parameters for other common stars are not distinguished by good agree ment we trust our results more while the discrepancies are apparently related to the errors or misprints in darma et al 2019 conclusions in this paper we considered a sample of 36 candidates for close within 1 pc encounters with the solar system the encounter parameters for this stars were calculated using the 1 linear and 2 epicyclic methods and 3 by integrating the orbits in an axisymmetric potential we concluded that the epicyclic method works quite well only on a time interval no longer than 1 myr while the parameters found by methods 1 and 3 are in excellent agreement between themselves we concluded that in searching for stellar encounters the simple linear method could be applied at the first searching stage and the more complex method based on the integration of stellar orbits in a potential could be applied at the second more detailed stage we confirmed the conclusion by wysoczan ska et al 2020 that the star als 9243 is an interesting candidate for very close encounters with the solar system based on the third method we found the following parameters tmin 2 37 0 52 myr and dmin 0 21 0 80 pc the encounter parameters for two stars from the list by darma et al 2019 are of interest for example for the star gaia dr 2 52952724810126208 the following estimates were found by the third method in agreement with the linear one tmin 0 55 0 06 myr and dmin 0 21 0 09 pc while for the star gaia dr 2 3130033734235815424 tmin 0 62 0 12 myr and dmin 0 30 0 10 pc have been obtained for the first time on the whole we showed that there are 15 candidates for encounters with the solar system within 0 5 pc i e candidates for a passage through the oort cloud the star gj 710 still remains the record holder based for example on the third method we found the following estimates of the encounter parameters for it tmin 1 320 0 040 myr and dmin 0 016 0 009 pc 12 acknowledgments we are grateful to the referee for the useful remarks that
