abstract we report on a simultaneous nustar and swift observation of the neutron star low mass x ray binary 4 u 1728 34 we identified and removed four type i x ray bursts during the observation in order to study the persistent emission the continuum spectrum is hard and well described by a black body with kt 1 5 kev and a cutoff power law with 1 5 and a cutoff temperature of 25 kev residuals between 6 and 8 kev provide strong evidence of a broad fe k line by modeling the spectrum with a relativistically blurred reflection model we find an upper limit for the inner disk radius of rin 2 risco consequently we find that rns 23 km assuming m 1 4 m and a 0 15 we also find an upper limit on the magnetic field of b 2 10 8 g subject headings accretion accretion disks x rays binaries stars neutron 1 introduction iron emission lines with energies from 6 4 to 7 1 kev have been detected in some neutron star x ray systems e g gottwald et al 1995 miller et al 2013 degenaar et al 2015 king et al 2016 these lines are most likely due to the fluo rescent k transition of iron caused by the reflection of hard x ray emission onto an area of the accretion disk close to the compact object fabian et al 1989 relativistic and doppler effects distort the profile of the line broadening it signifi cantly and skewing it to low energies miller 2007 reynolds nowak 2003 from this unique shape one can measure interesting properties of the accretion disk including its in ner radius an upper limit for the neutron star radius can thus be inferred from the reflection spectrum which is critical to

nustar har rison et al 2013 has been successful in revealing iron k lines and reflection spectra in neutron stars e g miller et al 2013 degenaar et al 2015 king et al 2016 in this work we analyze a coordinated nustar and swift observation of 4 u 1728 34 in an effort to further constrain its reflection spec trum and thus the neutron star radius 2 observations and data reduction nustar observed 4 u 1728 34 on 2013 october 1 for 33 5 ks obs id 80001012002 figure 1 the data were processed with the nustar data analysis software nustardas ver sion 1 4 1 and caldb 20150702 resulting in 27 ks of net exposure time we extracted spectra from the fpma and fpmb focal planes using a circular region with a 180 ra dius centered at the source position we used a 671 114 rectangular background region centered 388 away from the source position at 5 kev the ratio of source count rate to background count rate is 200 and at 50 kev this ratio is 3 indicating that the spectrum is not very sensitive to the back ground estimate due to a known shift in gain offset that has not been properly accounted for in the current response files used for the reduction in this paper we restrict our analysis to the 4 5 78 4 kev band 14 an observation obsid 00080185001 of 4 u 1728 34 was made with the swift gehrels et al 2004 x ray telescope xrt burrows et al 2005 near the beginning of the nus tar observation see

the detector for the first orbit and we produced an energy spectrum us ing only the second orbit giving an exposure time of 1068 s as this source has a relatively high column density we used only grade 0 photons as this is the recommended procedure for high column density sources 15 the 0 7 10 kev spec trum was extracted from a circular region with a 20 pixel 47 radius and background was taken from a region far from the source we obtained a source count rate in the 0 7 10 kev band of 17 7 c s for spectral fitting we calcu lated a response matrix appropriate for grade 0 photons file swxwt 0

et al 1996 cross sections and wilms et al 2000 abundances the spec tra were binned such that the signal to noise ratio in each bin is 15 to better constrain the low energy spectrum partic ularly the column density we fit the swift spectrum together with the nustar spectra due to flux variations between the instruments we added a multiplicative constant in each fit we fixed the constant for the nustar fpma spectrum to unity and allowed the constants for the nustar fpmb and swift spectra to vary 3 analysis and results 4 u 1728 34 is known to exhibit type 1 x ray bursts us ing the light curves

gradually with time indicat ing a fairly stable spectrum by studying the power spectrum of this observation mondal et al 2016 identified the state as the island state and we do not disagree with this result we first fit the combined swift and nustar continuum spectra similarly to ng et al 2010 with a model consisting of a neutral absorption component tbabs a single tempera ture blackbodybbodyrad a disk blackbody diskbb and a powerlaw component cutoffpl this model takes into ac count thermal emission from the boundary layer between the neutron star surface and disk thermal emission from the disk

residuals between 6 8 kev indicate the presence of iron emission ilarly to d a et al 2006 and egron et al 2011 we lim ited the line width to 0 5 kev resulting in a line energy of 6 56 0 05 kev and an equivalent width of 74 ev the addition of a gaussian significantly improved the fit with a 2 dof 1529 1253 1 22 moreover the diskbb compo nent became statistically insignificant its exclusion from the fit resulting in 2 5 and only slight changes to the other parameters we continued our analysis without the diskbb component having confirmed the presence of the iron line with the gaussian model we replaced the gaussian with a physical reflection model reflionx ross fabian 2005 the reflionx model used here is a version of ross fabian 2005 that assumes reflection of a power law with a high energy exponential cutoff to take relativistic blurring into account we convolved reflionx with kerrconv bren neman reynolds 2006 the reflionx parameters include the photon index and cutoff energy tied to those of the cutoffpl component the ionization l nr 2 or the ratio of the flux to the col umn density where l is the luminosity r is the distance and n is the column density the iron abundance afe and the flux the kerrconv parameters include the compact object spin parameter disk inclination disk inner and outer radius and inner and outer emissivity indices the spin parameter a cj gm 2 0 15 where j is angular momentum can be calculated from previous measurements of the neutron star spin frequency 363 hz strohmayer et al 1996 assuming a typical neutron star mass of m 1 4 m we fixed the disk outer radius rout 400 risco where risco is the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit because the emissivity profile drops steeply with radius causing the fits to be insensitive to the exact value of this parameter as it was difficult to constrain the emissivity of the re flecting disk when it was left free we considered fits with q 1 2 3 4 and 5 we also considered modeling the emis sivity as a broken power law with the outer index fixed to 3 the inner index left free and the break radius fixed to 25 rg but we were unable to constrain the inner index as shown in table 1 the changes in emissivity negligibly affect the 2 furthermore the values for the inner radius are very similar across the models other than q 1 where the inner radius has very large error bars as the parameters particularly the in ner radius seem to be insensitive to the emissivity we contin ued our analysis with the emissivity fixed at q 3 consistent with a newtonian geometry far from the neutron star adding the reflection component figure 5 improves the fit over the gaussian line model 2 dof 1430 1254 1 14 2 99 table 2 lists the best fit parameters for the relativistically blurred reflection model model 1 we find an inclination of 37 consistent with the lack of dips in the light curve which implies a low viewing angle from the nor malization of bbodyrad we find a blackbody source radius of 1 4 km consistent with thermal emission from the bound ary layer we find a higher column density nh 4 5 10 22 cm 2 than what has been previously measured for this source nh 2 6 2 9 1022 cm 2 e g di salvo et al 2000 piraino et al 2000 narita et al 2001 egron et al 2011 to be con sistent with past measurements we fixed the column density to 2 9 1022 cm 2 figure 6 model 2 in table 2 this signif icantly worsens the fit resulting in a 2 dof 1712 1255 1 36 2 282 yet does not cause a large change to the main parameter of interest rin due to the proximity of 4 u 1728 34 to the galactic plane b 0 15 it is reasonable to consider the column density of molecular hydrogen galactic surveys indicate that at the position of 4 u 1728 34 nh 2 1 8 10 22 cm 2 dame et al 2001 and nhi 1 24 10 22 cm 2 kalberla et al 2005 thus the expected total column density is nhtotal nhi 2 nh 2 4 84 10 22 cm 2 close to our measured value we conclude that the model with the column density as a free pa rameter which is a better fit to the data is more correct from this model we find an upper limit for the disk inner radius rin 1 77 risco with the best value at rin 1 00 0 77 0 risco we consider if the reflection parameters are mostly con strained by the iron line as opposed to the reflected continuum by fitting the data with the relline model a relativistic line profile excluding broadband features such as the comp ton

components blackbody dashed and dotted cutoff power law dashed and reflionx dotted consistent with our above upper limit of rin 1 77 risco and is even better constrained however the relline model with 2 dof 1532 1255 1 22 is not as good a fit as the broadband reflection model described above 2 dof 1 14 suggesting that the broadband reflection spectrum does make some contribution at least statistically to verify that the swift spectrum helps constrain the spec tral shape we fit only the nustar data using the reflionx model model 4 in table 2 we fixed the column density to 2 9 1022 cm 2 as the nustar data is unable to measure this parameter fitting only the nustar spectrum with this model resulted in a 2 dof 1256 1096 1 15 and is sta tistically better than including the swift data model 3 in ta ble 2 2 dof 1712 1255 1 36 however without the low energy coverage offered by swift the column density cannot be well measured and thus the inaccuracy of fixing nh 2 9 10 22 cm 2 is not revealed in the fit statistics with out the swift spectrum we find rin 2 7 risco as an upper limit for the inner radius contrasting rin 1 4 risco found in model 3 indicating that the swift spectrum is useful in eval uating the main parameter of interest as well as the column density mondal et al 2016 have also analyzed this coordinated nustar and swift observation fitting the data instead with relxill another relativistically blurred reflection model garc a et al 2014 to compare to their results we also fit the spectrum with relxill and in addition replaced cutoffpl for the more physical comptt the relxill parameters include the ionization iron abundance compact object spin parameter disk inclination disk inner and outer radius and inner and outer emissivity indices we fixed rout 400 rg and a 0 15 similarly to mondal et al 2016 we fixed qout 3 and left qin free but we were only able to find a lower limit on qin the relxill model is statisti 5 cally similar to model 1 with a 2 dof 1412 1250 1 13 and the best fit parameters shown in table 3 are compara ble to those of model 1 in particular the column density nh 3 9 10 22 cm 2 is considerably higher than past mea surements and the inclination i 37 is the same as model 1 we find an upper limit of rin 2 risco for the disk in ner radius with the best value at rin 1 6 0 4 this upper limit is close to our previous upper limit of 1 77 risco but as it is slightly higher we continue our analysis considering rin 2 risco as the upper limit for the disk inner radius with spin parameter value of a 0 15 we calculate 1 risco 5 5 rg bardeen et al 1972 assuming a typical neu tron star mass of 1 4 m we find an upper limit for the neu tron star radius rns 2 5 5 rg 23 km figure 8 4 discussion the unabsorbed flux extrapolated in the 0 1 100 kev en ergy range is f 6 10 9 erg cm 2 s 1 assuming a dis tance to the source of 5 1 kpc di salvo et al 2000 galloway et al 2003 we calculate a luminosity l 0 1 100 1 9 10 37 erg s 1 corresponding to 8 of the eddington luminosity ledd 2 5 10 38 erg s 1 van paradijs mcclintock 1994 we note that this value is around an average luminosity for 4 u 1728 34 compared to previous observations di salvo et al 2000 measured l 0 1 100 2 10 37 erg s 1 others have used different energy ranges for the sake of comparison we re calculate the unabsorbed flux and luminosity in different ranges egron et al 2011 measured l 0 1 150 5 10 36 erg s 1 in comparison to our value of l 0 1 150 1 9 10 37 erg s 1 piraino et al 2000 measured l 0 2 50 3 7 10 37 erg s 1 while we measure of l 0 2 50 1 7 10 37 erg s 1 ng et al 2010 measured l 2 10 7 8 10 35 erg s 1 compared to our measurement of l 2 10 6 6 10 36 erg s 1 with our upper limit on the accretion disk inner radius rin 23 km we infer an upper limit on the neutron star mag netic field strength by equating the magnetic field pressure to the ram pressure of the accretion disk illarionov sunyaev 1975 we use the following relation rin 4 10 8 b 4 7 11 m 2 7 15 m 1 7 cm 1 where b 11 is the magnetic field in units of 10 11 g m 15 is the mass accretion rate in units of 1015 g s 1 and m is the neutron star mass in solar masses we calculate the mass accretion rate from the luminosity given above with the relation l m c 2 where gm rc 2 assuming m 1 4 m we find b 2 108 g we compare our results with those obtained for other neu tron star lmxbs also observed with nustar miller et al 2013 found that serpens x 1 a persistent source has a disk extending almost to the isco when observed at a luminos ity of l 0 44 ledd from their measured values of l and rin we estimate b 2 2 10 8 g degenaar et al 2015 found that 4 u 1608 52 a transient source with a spin fre quency of 620 hz also has a disk extending close to the isco when observed at a luminosity of l 0 02 ledd we estimate b 1 2 108 g aql x 1 also a transient observed by king et al 2016 at a luminosity of l 0 08 ledd has a truncated disk rin 15 rg a spin frequency of 550 hz and a magnetic field b 5 2 108 g in using equation 1 we assume that the magnetic pressure truncates the accretion disk illarionov sunyaev 1975 if this is the case we expect to see pulsations yet of the above sources only aql x 1 has been observed to exhibit pulsations during outburst casella et al 2008 papitto et al 2013 note that exhibiting pulsations is rare among lmxbs and consider various explanations including the possibility that the spin axis is aligned with the magnetic axis lamb et al 2009 that pulsations do exist but the pulse amplitude is below the de tectable threshold or that magneto hydrodynamical instabili ties cause material to accrete onto the neutron star at random places instead of being channeled by the magnetic field lines romanova et al 2008 the lack of pulsations in 4 u 1728 34 4 u 1608 52 and serpens x 1 may indicate that our as sumption of the magnetic pressure truncating the disk is not correct or at least not the complete physical picture in that case the true magnetic field values of these sources are most likely somewhat lower than the upper limits quoted above according to white zhang 1997 a higher spin fre quency should imply a lower magnetic field with a low mag netic field the disk can extend deeper into the potential spin ning up the neutron star while it is consistent that the disk extends closer to the isco in the above sources with lower magnetic fields the correlation between spin frequency and magnetic field is not always followed while 4 u 1608 52 has the highest spin frequency and lowest magnetic field aql x 1 has both a higher spin frequency and a higher magnetic field than 4 u 1728 34 the spin frequency of serpens x 1 is un known so we leave it out of this comparison it is likely that this discrepancy is due to the expected vari ability in lmxb spin periods and magnetic fields addition ally as we are considering upper limits on the magnetic fields we recognize that better estimates of the magnetic field values could negate this discrepancy it is possible however that the discrepancy is real in which case we consider the effects of magnetic field screening cumming et al 2001 as an expla nation magnetic field screening is a process by which the accreting matter becomes magnetized slowly compared to the accretion rate causing the field implied by equating the pres sures to be orders of magnitude smaller than the true field of the neutron star because aql x 1 is a transient we con sider the possibility that the magnetic field emerges during quiescence and is not screened immediately after the outburst begins the time it takes for the magnetic field to become significantly screened depends on accretion rate for an accre tion rate of 0 08 ledd the field will be screened by one order of magnitude five days or less after the outburst began cum ming 2008 the observation of aql x 1 occurred less than five days after the outburst began hence it is possible that aql x 1 is not fully screened though a better estimate of the screening timescale could further support or refute this hy pothesis this possibility provides an explanation for the low spin frequency and magnetic field of 4 u 1728 34 as compared to aql x 1 we consider possible mechanisms for accretion onto the neutron star because the magnetic field is relatively low it is possible that the material is getting to the neutron star via a magnetic gate lamb et al 1977 due to chaotic accretion on the stellar surface type ii x ray bursts are expected in the magnetic gate model yet are not exhibited in 4 u 1728 34 instead the material could be channeled along the magnetic field lines to the poles lamb et al 2009 this scenario would cause a hot spot on the magnetic pole however it is possible that the magnetic axis is aligned with the rotation axis as 4 u 1728 34 does not emit regular pulsations 6 1 2 5 10 20 50 0 01 0 1 1 10 c ou nt s s ke v 1 2 5 10 20 50 energy kev 4 2 0 2 4 a 1 2 5 10 20 50

summary we have analyzed the persistent emission of neutron star lmxb 4 u 1728 34 using a concurrent nustar and swi f t observation by fitting the continuum with a power law and thermal components we find clear evidence of an fe k line in the spectrum of 4 u 1728 34 with a relativistically blurred reflection model we find an upper limit to the accretion disk inner radius and thus the neutron star
