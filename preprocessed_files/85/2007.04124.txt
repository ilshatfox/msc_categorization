stars was recently carried out by marton et al 2019 and vioque et al 2020 according to the gaiadr 2 catalog using a number of photometric infrared surveys we have determined the rotation parameters of

http arxiv org abs 2007 04124 v 2 1 introduction recently stars that have not reached the main sequence stage pms have attracted great interest of researchers these include both herbig ae be stars haebes stars with masses from 2 m to 10 m and stars like ttau with masses less than 2 m in studying the structure and kinematics of the galaxy such stars are important due to their exceptional youth however until recently astrometric data necessary for analysis were known only for several hundreds of such stars located in the gould belt region i e near the sun wichmann et al 1998 bertout et al 1999 mamajek et al 2002 nevertheless their analysis led to a deep understanding of the evolution of the stellar associations closest to the sun preibisch zinnecker 1999 the example of the sco cen association showed in particular that there are no significant differences in the kinematics of massive ob stars and less massive pms stars sartori et al 2003 with the advent of the gaiadr 2 gaia collaboration 2016 2018 a catalog it became possible to study a large number of such stars the catalog contains trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions of about 1 3 billion stars for a relatively small fraction of these stars also their line of sight velocities were measured photometric measurements are presented in two broad bands so only a very rough classification of stars is possible for reliable classification it is necessary to use more accurate spectral and photometric data from other sources nevertheless according to the gaia dr 2 catalog a number of important studies have been carried out related to the kinematics of various galactic subsystems for this as distant young objects for example ob stars xu et al 2018 bobylev bajkova 2018 classical cepheids mro z et al 2019 or open star clusters soubiran et al 2018 bobylev bajkova 2019 a were used more than 11 000 high confidence pre main sequence members of scoob 2 were selected from the gaiadr 2 catalog in work of damiani et al 2019 more than 11 000 young stellar objects yso are highlighted in the vela ob association area by cantat gaudin et al 2019 the structure of the association in the orion arm was studied using 1000 yso with data from the gaiadr 2 catalog in work of grosschedl at al 2018 in the region of the gould belt i e in a near solar neighborhood with a radius of 500 pc zari et al 2018 selected more than 40 000 stars of the ttau type according to kinematic and photometric data a list of over 1 1 million yso candidates has been compiled in work of marton et al 2019 which are already distributed in a wider neighborhood of the sun using the yso sample from this cata log krisanova et al 2020 obtained estimates of the rotation parameters of the galaxy their values are in good agreement with the estimates of other authors obtained from other young objects however we were faced with the fact that the stars we selected had a rather large dispersion of residual velocities about 16 km s 1 which is higher than the expected value for young stars of 10 km s 1 apparently the sample was contaminated with older stars in addition the sample contained stars with relative trigonometric parallax errors of less than 20 in this paper we want to use another division of stars into groups and also consider stars with parallax errors of less than 10 vioque et al 2020 compiled a completely new catalog of herbig ae be classical be and pms stars it contains more than 10 000 stars with kinematic and photometric data from the gaia dr 2 catalog the selection of these stars was carried out according to a method different from that used in marton et al 2019 the aim of this work is to compile pms stars samples from the works vioque et al 2020 and marton et al 2019 with the least amount of contamination and to determine from them the parameters of the rotation of the galaxy and the parameters of the ellipsoid of the residual velocities of stars 2 method 2 1 the galaxy rotation curve parameters we use a rectangular coordinate system centered on the sun in which the x axis is directed toward the galactic center the y axis is toward the galactic rotation and the z axis is toward the north pole of the galaxy then x r cos l cos b y r sin l cos b and z r sin b from observations there are known three components of a star velocities the line of sight velocity vr and two projections of the tangential velocity vl 4 74 r l cos b and vb 4 74 r b directed along the galactic longitude l and latitude b respectively all the velocity components are measured in km s 1 here the coefficient 4 74 is the ratio of the number of kilometers in an astronomical unit to the number of seconds in a tropical year and r 1 is the 2 heliocentric distance of the star in kpc which we calculate through the parallax of the star in mas the components of the proper motion l cos b and b are expressed in mas year 1 to determine the parameters of the galactic rotation curve we use equations obtained from the bottlinger formulas in which the angular velocity is expanded into a taylor series in powers of r r 0 to terms of the second order of smallness r r 0 vl u sin l v cos l r 0 cos b r r 0 r 0 cos l r cos b 0 0 5 r r 0 2 r 0 cos l r cos b 0 1 vb u cos l sin b v sin l sin b w cos b r 0 r r 0 sin l sin b 0 0 5 r 0 r r 0 2 sin l sin b 0 2 where 0 is the angular velocity of the galaxy at a solar distance r 0 i 0 is the i th derivative of the angular velocity with respect to r the linear rotation velocity at a solar distance equals to v 0 r 0 0 r 0 is the galactocentric distance of the sun r is the distance from the star to the axis of galactic rotation r 2 r 2 cos 2 b 2 r 0 r cos b cos l r 2 0 the well known oort lindblad kinematic model ogorodnikov 1965 where two expansions are per formed in a series the expansion of the angular velocity in powers of r r 0 and the expansion of the distance r in powers of r as a result the applicability of the oort lindblad model is limited by the distance r 2 kpc the range of applicability of the model 1 2 is much wider 5 6 kpc in addition this area can be easily expanded by adding more and more expansion terms the use of two terms of the expansion as in our case is good because it allows one to obtain the rotation curve of the galaxy without unnecessary fine details over the entire considered range of distances r an example of a galactic rotation curve with different numbers of derivatives in the expansion of is given for example in bobylev et al 2020 when analyzing galactic masers 2 2 choosing the value of r 0 currently a number of works have been done on determining the average value of the distance from the sun to the center of the galaxy using individual definitions of this quantity obtained in the last decade by independent methods for example r 0 8 0 0 2 kpc valle e 2017 r 0 8 4 0 4 kpc de grijs bono 2017 or r 0 8 0 0 15 kpc camarillo et al 2018 we also note some of the first class individual definitions of this quantity made recently an estimate of r 0 7 9 0 3 kpc hirota et al 2020 was obtained for the masers of the japanese vera program in gravity collaboration 2019 from an analysis of a 16 year long series of observations of the motion of star s 2 around a supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy r 0 8 178 0 022 kpc was found in do et al 2019 based on an independent analysis of the orbit of star s 2 r 0 7 946 0 032 kpc was found based on the above results in the present work we assume the value r 0 8 0 0 15 kpc 2 3 distance calculation since the publication of the gaia dr 2 catalog a problem with trigonometric parallaxes of gaia dr 2 has been known namely the need to correct with a value from 0 03 to 0 05 mas gaia collaboration 2018 b c taking into account the results of determining the value of this correction obtained in riess et al 2018 yalyalieva et al 2018 zinn et al 2019 we add to all the original parallaxes of stars from the gaia dr 2 catalog a correction of 0 05 mas i e new 0 05 mas 2 4 residual velocity formation for formation of the residual velocities we take into account primarily the peculiar velocity of the sun u v and w it is also necessary to take into account the influence of the differential rotation of the galaxy the expressions for accounting for these effects are as follows vl v l u sin l v cos l r 0 cos b r r 0 r 0 cos l r cos b 0 0 5 r r 0 2 r 0 cos l r cos b 0 3 vb v b u cos l sin b v sin l sin b w cos b r 0 r r 0 sin l sin b 0 0 5 r 0 r r 0 2 sin l sin b 0 4 where v l v b standing on the right hand sides of the equations are the initial uncorrected velocities and on the left hand sides there are the corrected velocities vl vb 3 2 5 the residual velocity ellipsoid we estimated the dispersion of the stellar residual velocities using the following well known method ogorodnikov 1965 let u v w be the velocities along the coordinate axes x y and z let us consider the six second order moments a b c f e d a u 2 u 2 b v 2 v 2 c w 2 w 2 f vw v w e wu w u d uv u v 5 which are the coefficients of the equation for the surface ax 2 by 2 cz 2 2 fyz 2 ezx 2 dxy 1 6 and also the components of the symmetric tensor of moments of the residual velocities a d e d b f e f c 7 to determine the values in this tensor in the absence of radial velocity data the following three equations are used v 2 l a sin 2 l b cos 2 l sin 2 l 2 d sin l cos l 8 v 2 b a sin 2 b cos 2 l b sin 2 b sin 2 l c cos 2 b 2 f cos b sin b sin l 2 e cos b sin b cos l 2 d sin l cos l sin 2 b 9 vlvb a sin l cos l sin b b sin l cos l sin b f cos l cos b e sin l cos b d sin 2 l sin b cos 2 sin b 10 for which least squares solutions were obtained for the six unknowns a b c f e d we then found the eigenvalues of the tensor 7 1 2 3 by solving the secular equation a d e d b f e f c 0 11 this equation s eigenvalues are inverse squares of the semi axes of the ellipsoid of the velocity moments at the same time they are the squares of the semi axes of the residual velocity ellipsoid 1 2 1 2 2 2 3 2 3 1 2 3 12 we found the directions of the main axes of the tensor 11 l 1 2 3 and b 1 2 3 from the relations tanl 1 2 3 ef c d b c f 2 13 tanb 1 2 3 b e df f 2 b c cosl 1 2 3 14 3 data 3 1

693 candidates for classic be stars cbe are stars of spectral class b located on the main sequence have fast axial rotation they are surrounded by gas disks these are the most massive stars among those considered by us the either sample includes 1309 stars it includes stars that have the following probability values p ppms pcbe 50 but ppms 50 and pcbe 50 all of these samples contain very young stars there are no intersections between samples in order to attract the maximum number of young stars in the problem of determining the rotation parameters of the galaxy we also formed a combined sample all which included the stars of the three samples cbe either and pms the color magnitude diagram for stars of the all sample from the vioque et al 2020 catalog with distances greater than 0 5

with relative trigonometric parallax errors of less than 10 on the galactic plane xy is given in fig 2 shows a pattern with a pitch angle of 13 according to bobylev bajkova 2014 connection with other segments of the global spiral structure is also visible although to a more less extent for example in the distribution of more massive stars fig 2 a you can see the concentration of stars in the second galactic quadrant near the perseus arm and in the distribution of less massive stars fig 2 b several condensations are clearly visible near the carina sagittarius arm 3 2 marton et al data marton et al 2019 obtained a sample of young stars from a combination of gaia dsr 2 and wise catalogs data using dust transparency indices from planck plank collaboration 2016 in total the marton et al 2019 catalog contains more than 100 million objects of various nature for a detailed study of the young population of the milky way they compiled a list of more than 1 1 million candidates for young star objects these authors introduced 4 main classes yso extragalactic objects main sequence stars and evolved stars for each object the probability of belonging to each of the four classes considered is calculated in krisanova et al 2020 the restrictions for the selection of yso stars were as follows line of sight velocity error 10 km s 1 heliocentric distance 3 kpc and relative parallax error 15 and according to the probabilities from marton et al 2019 it was r 0 5 ly 0 8 where r is a probability that wise w 3 and w 4 detections are real and ly is a probability of the source being a yso using all wise bands and when solving the basic kinematic equations we got a rather large value of the error of a unit of weight about 16 km s 1 experimentally we found the conditions for the selection of stars which ultimately have very small variances of their residual velocities these are the following restrictions on the probability values ly 0 95 and sy 0 98 and lms 0 5 sms 0 5 se 0 5 and seg 0 5 15 where sy is a probability of the source being a yso without w 3 and w 4 wise bands lms is a probability of the source being a main sequence star using all wise bands sms is a probability of the source being a main sequence star without w 3 and w 4 wise bands se is a probability of the source being an evolved star without w 3 and w 4 wise bands and seg is a probability of the source being an extragalactic object without w 3 and w 4 wise bands with this selection we finally have 5571 stars with relative trigonometric parallax errors of less than 10 they are located no further than 4 kpc from the sun the cmd diagram for stars from the marton et al 2019 catalog with distances greater than 0 5 kpc is given in fig 3 a and with distances less than 0 5 kpc in fig 3 b note that the diagram is constructed without taking into account absorption as can be seen from fig 3 a all relatively distant stars in the cmd diagram lie above the main sequence unlike the sample from the vioque et al 2020 catalog here we have quite a few stars from the gould belt region moreover about half of them apparently are old low mass stars of the main sequence therefore we divided the sample of nearby stars into two parts with the boundary mg 2 7 bp rp 2 m the division of stars close to the sun into two parts was made because these two samples have very strong differences both space distribution and kinematic properties 6 figure 3 cmd diagram for stars from the catalog of marton et al 2019 with distances greater than 0 5 kpc a with distances less than 0 5 kpc b figure 4 the

from the catalog of marton et al 2019 with relative trigono metric parallax errors of less than 10 on the galactic plane xy is given in fig 4 fig 4 a shows a spiral pattern with a pitch angle of 13 according to bobylev bajkova 2014 it is interesting to note that the distribution of stars in fig 4 a is very similar to the distribution of fig 2 b where the connection with the local spiral arm orion arm is also visible the distribution of stars in fig 4 b is very similar to the distribution of stars and ob associations characteristic of the gould belt but the distribution of stars in fig 4 c is already much less similar to the distribution of stars in the gould belt 4 results and discussion table 1 gives the values of kinematic parameters found from the stars from the catalog of vioque et al 2020 the data are divided into distant r 0 5 kpc which are given in the first three columns and nearby stars r 0 5 presented in the last column in the second and third columns the separation was performed in absolute value with the boundary mg 0 0 5 m as in fig 1 and in the first column of the table the results were obtained from a combined sample of distant stars as can be seen from fig 1 b there are few nearby stars from the catalog of vioque et al 2020 they are on almost 50 contaminated with main sequence stars the kinematics of young close stars has features associated with their belonging to the gould belt therefore when searching for galactic rotation parameters it is better not to use them table 2 gives the values of the kinematic parameters found from the stars from the catalog of marton et al 2019 the data are divided into distant r 0 5 kpc which are given in the first column and nearby stars with r 0 5 kpc presented in the second and third columns the separation of nearby stars was carried out in absolute value relative to the empirical dependence mg 2 7 bp rp 2 m as in fig 3 as can be seen from fig 3 b and fig 3 c as well as the table 2 the two samples of nearby stars have strong differences both in the distribution on the xy plane and in kinematics 4 1 galaxy rotation as can be seen from the tables 1 and 2 for all samples of stars with distances greater than 0 5 kpc the rotation parameters of the galaxy 0 0 and 0 are well defined these values are in good agreement both among themselves and with the results of the analysis of other samples of young objects in order to reduce random errors of the determined parameters of the galactic rotation when solving the system of equations 1 2 we formed a combined sample of distant stars taking into account the fact that between the samples of distant stars from the catalogs of vioque et al 2020 and marton et al 2019 there are about 700 common stars a sample of 4431 stars was obtained from this 8

around the center of the galaxy is v 0 229 1 4 4 km s 1 it can be seen that in the solution 16 random errors of the determined parameters decreased in comparison with the results specified in tables 1

s 1 kpc 3 the circular rotation velocity of the solar neighborhood around the galactic center is for the adopted r 0 8 0 0 15 kpc it is interesting to note the work of eilers et al 2019 where for a sample of more than 25 000 luminous red giant stars the estimate v 0 229 0 0 2 km s 1 for the adopted r 0 8 122 0 031 kpc was obtained rotation curve of the galaxy was constructed on the distance interval r 5 25 kpc in a recent work by ablimit et al 2020 about 3 500 classical cepheids from various sources were used to construct the rotation curve of the galaxy the circular rotation velocity of the solar neighbourhood was v 0 232 5 0 9 km s 1 which is in good agreement with our estimate of this speed based on the cepheids of this sample the rotation curve of the galaxy was constructed on the distance interval r 4 19 kpc 4 2 residual velocity bobylev 2020 performed a kinematic analysis of stars of the type ttau from the list of zari et al 2018 the error value of the unit of weight 0 for various samples is in the range of 10 12 km s 1 and the values of the oort constants a and b are close to ones inherent for the gould belt i e significantly different from the characteristics of galactic rotation an analysis of the movements of the stars of this sample 9 figure 5 the distribution of the combined sample of 4431 distant stars on the plane ln r r 0 the roman numerals in the figure number the carina sagittarius ii and perseus iii spiral arm segments of stars showed that the residual velocity ellipsoid with the main semiaxes 1 2 3 8 87 5 58 3 03 0 10 0 20 0 04 km s 1 is located at an angle of 22 1 to the galactic plane with the longitude of the ascending node 298 2 the components of the peculiar velocity of the sun u v w 12 48 14 78 6 86 km s 1 the variance of the residual velocities and the orientation parameters of the ellipsoid indicated in the penul timate column of the table 2 are in good agreement with the estimates characteristic for the gould belt fig 3 b also shows the close relationship of the stars of this sample with the gould belt it is also obvious that the velocity value v 19 10 0 91 km s 1 and the variance of the residual velocities indicated in the last column of table 2 indicate the dominance of old stars in this sample one of the goals of the present work was to select such conditions that would ensure obtaining a sample from the list of marton et al 2019 with a minimum dispersion of the residual velocities of stars the results indicated in the first and second columns of table 2 indicate that such a goal has been achieved of particular interest is the sample which analysis results are indicated in the first column of table 2 after all we only analyzed the components vl and vb calculated through parallaxes and proper motions moreover random errors of these velocities increase with increasing distance however as can be seen from the first column of table 2 the error of the unit weight 0 and the variance of the residual velocities 1 2 3 of these stars are small thus the application of constraints 15 in combination with the condition r 0 5 kpc if necessary with a constraint on allows one to select a uniform sample of very young stars from the catalog of marton et al 2019 the value 0 can be considered as the average coordinate dispersion of residual velocities over three coordinates the average dispersion of hydrogen clouds hi is 3 5 km s 1 clemens 1985 the dispersion of the residual velocities of distant ob stars is 10 12 km s 1 uemura et al 2000 bobylev bajkova 2019 b for example in the kinematic analysis of 6000 ob stars with proper motions and trigonometric parallaxes from the gaia dr 2 catalog the unit error was 0 11 km s 1 bobylev bajkova 2019 b thus the found value of 0 6 km s 1 indicates the extreme youth of the analyzed stars recently formed from hydrogen clouds in the catalog of vioque et al 2020 almost all stars are very young according to their positions on the cmd diagram they are generally more massive compared to the stars of our sample from the catalog of marton et al 2019 as can be seen from table 1 the variances of their residual velocities are also small the third axis of the ellipsoid of residual velocities found from distant stars does not deviate from the vertical which is clearly seen in the sample from the second column of table 1 where b 3 90 4 3 local arm the equation describing the position of a galactic object on the logarithmic spiral can be written in the following way r a 0 e 0 tan i 17 10 where a 0 0 is the object s position angle measured in the direction of galactic rotation tan y r 0 x where x y are galactic heliocentric rectangular coordinates of the object 0 is angle at which r a 0 i is pitch angle putting a 0 r 0 in equation 17 we can estimate the value of pitch angle i as tan i ln r r 0 0 18 where obviously 0 0 for this purpose a position angle distance logarithm diagram is con structed where arms of a logarithmic spiral are presented as line segments such method is widely used for studying the galactic spiral structure based on the various object data popova loktin 2005 xu et al 2013 bobylev bajkova 2014 the advantage of this approach is that the estimate of pitch angle i does not depend on the number of spiral arms as can be seen from fig 2 and fig 4 there are too few stars near the perseus and carina sagittarius spiral arms to specify the value of the pitch angle i but the section of the local arm is very well visible therefore we decided to find the value of the pitch angle i from the combined sample of 4431 distant stars in fig 5 the distribution of the combined sample of 4431 distant stars on the plane ln r r 0 is given the spiral arms characteristics were obtained from linear regression ln r r 0 a b see eq 18 the problem was solved both with unit weights using 1212 stars candidates for belonging to the local arm the following parameters were found a 0 1562 0 0023 and b 0 0075 0 0003 which implies that i 8 9 0 1 and the local arm near the sun extends toward the anticenter of the galaxy at a distance 60 2 pc x 60 2 pc the selection of stars for such an analysis was carried out by us in the area marked by a gray stripe in fig 5 the width of this area is chosen according to the estimate from reid et al 2019 all stars that fall into this area are marked in the figure with dark blue dots the red line in the figure shows a segment of the local arm with the found parameters carina sagittarius and perseus spiral arm segments with the same pitch angle are also given xu et al 2013 obtained an estimate of the pitch angle of the local arm i 10 1 2 7 using 30 masers with vlbi measured parallaxes with increasing number of measurements these authors found i 11 6 1 8 xu et al 2016 in work of reid et al 2019 a new estimate of i 11 4 1 9 was obtained from 28 sources 5 conclusions the kinematic properties of young stars that have not yet reached the stage of the main sequence are studied the selection of these stars was carried out in the works of marton et al 2019 and vioque et al 2020 according to the gaia dr 2 catalog and using various photometric infrared surveys the approaches of these authors have methodological differences therefore the properties of their samples have both differences and similarities we examined stars with relative trigonometric parallax errors of less than 10 first of all it can be noted that in the samples from work of vioque et al 2020 all the stars are very young among them the percentage of old main sequence stars is negligible in addition among them there are few stars from a near solar neighborhood with a radius of 0 5 kpc the catalog of marton et al 2019 contains a huge number of candidates in the yso with different values of the probability of belonging to young objects experimentally we found the conditions for the selection of stars which ultimately have very small variances of their residual velocities these are the following restrictions on the probability values ly 0 95 and sy 0 98 provided lms 0 5 sms 0 5 se 0 5 and seg 0 5 with this selection it turns out that all relatively distant stars r 0 5 kpc in the cmd diagram lie above the main sequence from distant stars r 0 5 kpc from both catalogs the galactic rotation curve parameters were determined in good agreement with each other the linear velocity of the galactic rotation v 0 is in the range 227 229 km s 1 and the error in determining this value in both cases is 4 4 km s 1 it can be noted that the sample of stars from the catalog of vioque et al 2020 contains generally more massive stars compared to the sample from the catalog of marton et al 2019 although in the region of faint stars between these catalogs there are about 15 of the total stars the third axis of the ellipsoid of 11 residual velocities found from distant stars does not deviate from the vertical what is especially clearly seen in the sample of massive stars from 4431 proper motions of the combined sample of stars with relative trigonometric parallax errors of less than 10 and heliocentric distances from 0 5 kpc to 4 kpc the following values of the angular velocity of the galaxy were found 0 28 63 0 10 km s 1 kpc 1 0 4 007 0 032 km s 1 kpc 2 and 0 0 710 0 028 km s 1 kpc 3 where the linear velocity of the circular rotation of a solar neighborhood around the center of the galaxy is v 0 229 1 4 4 km s 1 for the accepted value r 0 8 0 0 15 kpc the variance of the residual velocities of the stars from the list of vioque et al 2020 slightly depends on the position of the stars in the cmd diagram from the stars from the bottom of the diagram with the absolute value mg 0 0 5 m the following parameters of the ellipsoid of their residual velocities were found 1 2 3 9 45 6 99 6 61 0 94 0 43 0 32 km s 1 and for the stars from the top of the diagram with the absolute value mg 0 0 5 m their values turned out to be somewhat larger 1 2 3 13 67 9 25 7 26 2 40 2 44 0 88 km s 1 the variance of the residual velocities of stars extracted from the catalog of marton et al 2019 is less dependent on the position of the stars in the cmd diagram they depend on the heliocentric distance of the stars of the sample based on the stars from the range of distances r 0 5 4 kpc the following parameters of the ellipsoid of their residual velocities were found 1 2 3 6 91 6 11 5 09 0 41 0 20 0 22 km s 1 and for nearby stars from the vicinity of r 0 5 kpc we found 1 2 3 9 96 5 40 0 9 0 14 0 96 3 8 km s 1 among the stars from the catalog of marton et al 2019 lying in a near solar neighborhood with a radius of 0 5 kpc the proportion of old main sequence stars is large using them the following parameters of the ellipsoid of their residual velocities were found 1 2 3 25 5 17 4 13 9 0 2 1 7 0 6 km s 1 distant stars from both catalogs trace the local spiral arm orion arm well for 1212 stars of the combined sample a new estimate of the pitch angle of the local spiral
