university of amsterdam 1090 ge amsterdam the netherlands accepted xxx received yyy in original form zzz abstract white dwarfs wds are the stellar core remnants of low mass 8 m stars they are typically divided into three main composition groups oxygen neon one carbon oxygen co and helium he wds the evolution of binary systems can significantly change the evolution of the binary stellar components in particular striping the en velope of an evolved star can give rise to a core remnant which can later evolve into a wd with significantly different composition here we focus on the formation and evolution of hybrid heco wds we follow the formation and stellar evolution of such wds for a range of initial conditions and provide their detailed structure mass radius relation and luminousity temperature evolution we find that both low mass wds 0 45 m typically thought to be he wds and intermediate mass wds 0 45 mwd 0 7 typically thought to be co wds could in fact be hybrid heco wds with 5 25 75 95 of their mass in he co we use population synthesis calculations to infer the birth rate and properties of such wds we find that hy brid heco wd comprise the majority of young 2 gyr wds in binaries but are more rare among older wds in binaries the high frequency and large he content of such wds could have an important role in wd wd mergers and may give rise to sub chandrasekhar thermonuclear supernova explosions key words stars white dwarfs stars evolution stars mass loss stars hori zontal branch 1 introduction white dwarfs wds are the stellar core remnants of low mass 8 m stars that formed following their post main sequence ms evolution they are composed mostly of electron degenerate matter and are divided into several types including wds composed of carbon oxygen co and oxygen neon one wds corresponding to the stel lar evolutionary end points of intermediate and high mass stars respectively the minimum mass of a present day wd formed through stellar evolution of a single star is in the range 0 50 0 52 m arising from the lowest mass stars with lifetimes shorter than the age of the universe 1 01 down to 0 84 m for z 1 5 z down to z 0 1 z respectively as calculated from stellar evolution models us ing the seba module toonen et al 2012 such wds would be co wds however binary evolution can change these outcomes and produce different types of wds and allow ing for a much lower mass range e g han et al 2002 rebassa mansergas et al 2011 and references therein in interacting binaries each of the stellar component may fill its roche lobe and may be stripped of part of its hydrogen helium rich envelope during its evolution on the red giant branch rgb or the asymptotic giant branch agb stage such altered evolution can give rise to qual itatively different evolution and the formation of present day very low mass vlm 0 45 m e g han et al 2002 wds the evolution and final outcomes of the binary evo lution strongly depend on the initial conditions the mass of the stellar components and their initial separation in particular wds of masses lower than 0 45 m are typ ically thought to be helium he wds formed through this channel e g iben tutukov 1985 han et al 2002 nelemans et al 2001 istrate et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 however the complex binary evolution channel can give rise to vlm as well as more massive hybrid wds composed of significant fractions of both co and he such white dwarfs descend from stars which fill their roche lobes in the stage of hydrogen burning in a shell become hot sub dwarfs in the he burning stage but do not experience envelope ex pansion after the formation of a degenerate carbon oxygen core iben tutukov 1985 nelemans et al 2000 the exact definition of a hybrid heco wd is somewhat arbitrary one can consider a hybrid heco wd as any wd in which no less than some fraction f of the mass is com 2018 the authors http arxiv org abs 1803 04444 v 2 2 zenati toonen perets posed of he and no less of a fraction f of the mass is com posed of co in practice in all of the hybridwds we find the the mass is dominated by co here we focus on such hybrid wds we explore their properties and evolutionary chan nels and discuss their implications on our understanding of wds and their structure which are strongly dependent on the composition not less important heco wds may have an important role in affecting the outcomes of wd mergers and in particular the possible production of thermonuclear sne from double degenerate wd mergers for the latter the existence of a significant mass in he can catalyze thermonu clear sn explosions even in sub chandrasekhar mass wds e g woosley et al 1986 iben et al 1987 livne glasner 1990 bildsten et al 2007 waldman et al 2011 hence un derstanding of hybrid wds is critical for a wide range of compact objects as well as their potential explosive merg ers heco wds have been first discussed by iben tutukov 1985 who suggested that a signifi cant fraction of the vlm wds could be heco wds rather than he only wds the possibility of heco wds later termed hybrid wds have been then further discussed though briefly in various contexts tutukov yungelson 1992 iben et al 1997 nelemans et al 2000 studies by althaus et al 2004 and panei et al 2007 explored the evolution of vlms from low mass 3 16 m progenitor stars and showed that oxygen core vlms can be formed through binary evolution producing wds in the mass range 0 35 0 45 m mostly composed of oxygen follow up studies by prada moroni straniero 2009 had been able to produce a co wd of 0 33 m suggesting it as the lower limit for such wds more recent studies have further developed the study of vlm he wds istrate et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 and references therein all of these later studies explored the possibility of vlm he wds with little discussion of the potential of hybrid he co vlms our focus is exploring the range of possible hybrid heco wds and their properties map the possible range of he to co mass fractions in these wds and characterize their structure and mass radius relationship our detailed stellar evolution findings using the mesa code paxton et al 2011 2015 can be used to direct the more simplified population synthesis models in order to characterize the general properties of hybrid wd that form their binary system progenitors and the type of double degenerate mergers in which they participate the outcomes of the latter are further explored in forthcoming publications the paper is structured as follows first section 2 we describe the methods used to explore the detailed stellar evo lution models using the mesa code and population stud ies using the seba population synthesis code section 3 for the formation of hybrid wds we present our main results in section 4 and then discuss the implications of hybrid wds and summarize section 5 2 detailed stellar evolution methods hybrid heco wds can evolve from intermediate mass stars in binary systems through through a phase of mass trans fer through roch lobe overflow rlof or shared common envelope evolution see e g ivanova et al 2013 in the in teracting binary the companion envelope can be stripped fol lowing the formation of a he core and the evolution on the red giant branch rgb the later evolution of the stripped star and the he core is then significantly altered compared with the uninterrupted evolution of a non interacting sin gle star when most of the red giant envelope is removed hydrogen shell burning is quelled the he core keeps grow ing and the star begins to contract if the he core is suf ficiently massive the contraction will eventually trigger he ignition see iben tutukov 1985 and the formation of a co core the he to co ratio will then be determined by the specific detailed evolution of he burning into co and mass loss through winds from the envelope in order to follow the complex evolution we begin by considering a range of initial binary conditions the initial binary separations are chosen such that the lower mass bi nary component will eventually fill its roche lobe the stel lar evolutionary tracks of binary components are followed from the pre ms stage until the final production of the wd we mapped these conditions into the stellar evolution code mesa and the used the binary mode paxton et al 2015 to follow their evolution for the range of initial conditions we also tested models where the binary evolution leading to effective mass loss had been introduced by us into single star models mass loss was introduced in these cases when the conditions for the radius and core mass are such that rlof is expected in practice this point is not fine tuned and these conditions can be fulfilled over a range of stel lar radii as indicated in table 1 once the star experiences the first thermal pulse or in some cases the second or third thermal pulses in this range the final outcomes of the evolu tion produce qualitatively and quantitatively similar results throughout our simulations we therefore show the results only for the choice of the middle point in the relevant range in all cases where both the binary and single mode models converged we obtained consistent final outcomes further validating both these approaches in some cases however only our altered single mode model numeri cally converged in which case we report the results only from the single mode model the properties of the ini tial binaries extend over a range of initial primary com ponent mass 2 5 m mdonor 4 m and mass ratios 0 65 q mdonor mcompanion 0 81 with the exception of one case with q 0 36 the detailed models and their out comes are summarized in table 1 we also modeled donor stars with lower masses 2 m but these only produced he wds or he wds with very low fraction of co also con sistent with results by prada moroni straniero 2009 though some models had been difficult to converge nu merically we were able to resolve the evolution of these bina ries through the whole relevant mass range and mass ratio in all these cases we were able to produce a hybrid heco wd in the following we discuss in detail our assumptions and initial conditions all of our models and mesa inlist files are openly available at github as to enable simple reproduction of the results github com hybrid wd in the following we list our detailed assumptions and considerations metallicity all models are of of solar metallicity stars z z 0 02 mnras 000 1 9 2018 hybrid he co white dwarfs 3 mass transfer we use a range of 10 8 10 10 m yr 1 for the min mdot f or implicit parameter mixing we set l hp 1 5 as the ratio of typical mixing length to the local pressure scale height where l is the mixing length is a free parameter and hp is the pres sure scale height semi convective mixing and thermohaline mixing are taken to be 0 01 and 2 respectively farmer et al 2016 nuclear reaction network we use a 75 isotope nuclear reaction network containing the relevant isotopes needed for he carbon and oxygen burning stopping condition we stop the evolution once the star becomes fully degenerate wd and no further evo lution beside wd cooling is observed our condition ef fectively translates to wd luminosity and temperature that fall below l 1 8 l teff 5 1 t eff or in some cases l 1 12 l teff 4 94 t eff respectively mass loss the effective mass loss is intro duced through the use of reimers formulation m 4 10 13 r l r m l r m where is in the range 0 7 1 in order to ensure that the mass of the star is appropriately adjusted following the mass loss we let the star relax afterwards overshoot the optimal overshoot parameter enabling numerical convergence for the whole mass range for 2 5 4 m was found to be fov 0 0016 3 population synthesis models the formation and evolution of interacting binaries pro ducing hybrid wds is simulated with the binary popula tion synthesis bps code seba portegies zwart verbunt 1996 toonen et al 2012 toonen nelemans 2013 seba is a fast code for simulating binary evolution based on parametrized stellar evolution including processes such as mass transfer episodes common envelope evolution and stel lar winds we employ seba to generate a large population of binaries on the zero age ms we simulate their subsequent evolution and extract those that produce hybrid heco wds it was shown in toonen et al 2014 that the main sources of differences between different bps codes is due to the choice of input physics and initial conditions here we focus only on a specific set of choices and use the de tailed stellar evolution models to test the bps models pre dictions for hybrid wds a wider range of initial conditions and physical assumptions will be explored in future work where hybrid wds may play a roles in the evolution of dou ble degenerate wd wd ns wd and bh wd mergers the basic conditions and assumptions we use embody a classical set up for bps calculations and the binaries are generated and evolved in the following way the primary masses are drawn from a kroupa imf kroupa et al 1993 with masses in the range between 0 1 100 m the secondary masses are drawn from a uniform mass ratio distribution with 0 q m 2 m 1 1 raghavan et al 2010 duche ne kraus 2013 de rosa et al 2014 the orbital separations a follow a uniform distribution in log a abt 1983 the initial eccentricities e follow a thermal distribution heggie 1975 a binary fraction b of 50 which is appropriate for a type primaries raghavan et al 2010 duche ne kraus 2013 hybrid definition unless stated otherwise in the bps calculations a hybrid is defined as a wd with at least 5 of its mass composed of he see eq 1 we allow bare degenerate helium cores to ignite if the core gets exposed through binary interactions when its mass is within 0 02 m of the mass where the helium flash happens han et al 2002 nelemans 2010 we construct two bps models that differ with respect to the common envelope phase this is a short phase in the evolution of a binary system when both stars share a common envelope despite its strong effect on the binary orbit common envelope evolution is poorly understood see e g ivanova et al 2013 for a review we replicate model and model from toonen et al 2017 where the prior is based on the classical energy balance during the common envelope phase whereas the latter is based on a balance of angular momentum in principle hybrid heco wds can be formed in two ways either through the common envelope or the rlof channels in the interacting binary the hydrogen rich envelope of the hybrid progenitor can be stripped following the formation of a he core and the evolution on the rgb or agb the later evolution of the stripped star and the he core is then signifi cantly altered compared with the uninterrupted evolution of a non interacting single star when most of the giant en velope is removed hydrogen shell burning is quelled giving rise to a helium star that can be observed as a possible sdb star if the he core is sufficiently massive mc 0 32 m he ignition can be triggered see iben tutukov 1985 lead ing to the formation of a co core the he to co ratio will then be determined by the specific detailed evolution for the intermediate mass stars in this channel the he ignites under non degenerate conditions in the second evolutionary channel for lower mass stars typically 2 m ignition of the he occurs under degener ate conditions in this channel the progenitors are stripped close to the peak of first giant branch contract and then ig nite see han et al 2002 for details however our detailed stellar evolution models show that wds produced through this channel are effectively he wds which contain only a very small fraction of co 1 nevertheless foe com pleteness we consider the bps of such wds but divide the contributions between the main channel and this latter chan nel which does not produce bona fide hybrid heco wds as discussed below the contribution from the low mass pro genitors is small and does not significantly affect any of our conclusions regarding hybrid wds 4 results 4 1 detailed stellar evolution models table 1 and figures 1 5 summarize the results for the mass composition and structure of hybrid wds as a function of their final mass resulting from our detailed stellar evolution models although hybrids of different masses are produced mnras 000 1 9 2018 4 zenati toonen perets figure 1 the he mass vs total mass of he wds from the detailed stellar evolution models the blue line depicts a linear fit for the range 0 4 mwd 0 72 from binaries which differ in various aspects initial mass mass ratio separation etc the final compositions form a fairly continuous sequence for most of the mass range with he mass fractions in the range 2 25 see fig 1 as ex pected the he forms an outer shell around the co core with only a very small layer of mixed co he composition see fig 5 our detailed stellar evolution models suggest that the he mass in the wd mhe can be approximated by mhe 0 28 0 39 mwd 1 for most of the mass range 0 4 mwd 0 7 where mwd is the mass of the wd this is also approximately consistent with estimates for the core mass of he stars at which point he burning is quenched as found by hurley et al 2000 see their eq 89 and implies there is a maximum mass for hybrids the maximum mass of a hybrid wd is therefore 0 72 m for which the he mass goes to zero however for a more conservative limit requiring a significant fraction of the wd mass to be in he e g 5 the maximum mass becomes 0 63 m a lower limit to the mass of a hybrid is expected to be around 0 32 m as below the core is not massive enough to ignite he burning e g han et al 2002 4 1 1 evolution on the hr diagram in fig 2 we show the evolution of the heco wd progenitor on the hr diagram for six of the models in table 1 covering the full mass range the other three are not shown for clarity but they behave very similarly as can be seen the evolu tion can be quite complex and though we are mostly inter ested in the final wd configuration we refer the interested reader to iben tutukov 1985 for a detailed discussion of the various evolutionary stages before the final formation of the hybrid wd in fig 3 we compare the results from the mesa binary evolution model to a more simplified single star evolution where the envelope stripping is included arti ficially without fully following the binary evolution as can 3 63 844 24 44 64 855 25 4 log teff 6 4 2 0 2 4 6 l o g l l mwd 0 363 m mwd 0

the single models follow a different evolution at early times but following the stripping they results in the same wd configuration and evolution supporting their general use for modeling hybrids this also suggests that uncertain ties in the mass transfer phase do not significantly affect the final structure of the hybrid wds overall we find only small differences in the final wd configurations when we use the single and binary models with typical c o and he masses differences of less than 1 besides the case of mwd 0 58 where a 5 difference in the he abundance was found 4 2 structure and composition of of heco hybrid wds the mass radius relation for the heco wds is shown in fig 4 as expected the heco wds radii typically fall in between those of co wds and purely he wds 4 3 population

roughly 6 of the formed hybrids survive as a hybrid wds since a significant fraction of these binaries merge and are reduced from the overall population 4 3 1 formation channels most hybrids are formed from intermediate mass stars in the first channel at a time integrated birthrate of 2 7 3 0 10 3 per m of created stars the masses of the hybrids span a large range from a lower limit of 0 32 m to the up per limit set to 0 63 m the birthrate in this channel is therefore sensitive to our assumption about the minimum he fraction of a hybrid if we are more less conservative with our assumption of what constitutes a hybrid wd and include hybrids with he mass fractions only down to 10 1 the time integrated birthrate from the first channel decreases increases to 2 0 2 3 10 3 3 2 3 4 10 3 per m of created stars the full range of masses is reached by hy brid progenitors that fill their roche lobe on or before the rgb if the progenitor loses its hydrogen envelope on the agb the minimum hybrid mass is 0 52 m the progeni tors of the hybrids in this channel have typical zams masses mnras 000 1 9 2018 8 zenati toonen perets of 2 4 m and their formation times are short i e typically several hundred myrs this evolutionary channel therefore gives rise to low mass wd with masses comparable to those of co wds typically formed only after gyrs of evolution of single stars the formation of hybrid is nevertheless not limited to this short timescale but can extend up to several gyrs for hybrid that form only after the companion already has become a wd fig 7 the time integrated birthrate of the second evolution ary channel is about 8 3 9 4 10 4 per m of created stars hybrids from this channel have a mass between 0 32 and 0 48 m however as discussed earlier such wds are not likely to be bona fide hybrid wds and produce only minute fractions of co their formation times are typically long ranging up to several gyrs fig 7 initially the zams pro genitors of the hybrids are 1 2 m stars predominantly in a circularized orbit of about 200 500 r typically the com panion is hydrogen rich when the hybrid wd is formed as can be seen their overall contribution is small compared to the first formation channel from more massive progenitors besides late times of a few gyrs 4 3 2 evolution and mergers of hybrid wds in roughly half 48 56 of the cases the stellar compo nents of the hybrid wd binaries will eventually merge with one another through their late evolution in 25 37 of these mergers the hybrids merge with hydrogen rich stellar com panions and in the other systems the hybrids merge with wd companions given their large fractions among binary wds this suggest that a large fraction of all wd mergers in volve a hybrid wd the merger rate of hybrid white dwarfs is shown in fig 7 as a function of the merger time since zams after 4 gyr a steady state is reached between the formation and destruction rates of hybrid wds such that about there is about 1 5 2 hybrid per 1000 m of created stars fig 6 this later formed wds likely contain only a small fraction of co and are effectively he wds rather than bona fide hybrids another likely outcome is that the binary does not change significantly after the formation of the hybrid e g in cases where the secondary is a low mass ms star that does not evolve off the ms in a hubble time this happens for about 20 26 of the hybrids in 14 31 the binary expe riences one or more phases of mass transfer initiated by the secondary star and forms a double white dwarf system in about 2 0 3 9 of systems a cataclysmic variable is formed 5 discussion and summary in this work we have systematically studied the formation and evolution of hybrid heco wds in binary systems we studied a wide range of initial conditions and explored the distribution of the hybrid wds properties and formation times using binary population synthesis models our find ings suggest that hybrid heco wds can form robustly and give rise to a significant fraction of all wd binaries with 50 60 of all young 2 gyr wd being hybrids but they become rare among older populations in particular a large fraction of all vlm wds especially young ones typically considered to be he wds could in fact be hybrids more over the mass range of hybrid wds can extend up above to 0 62 m i e into the regime typically considered only for co wds therefore observationally hybrid wds could be misidentified as co db wds which could affect mass radius interpretations of observations similarly misidentifi cation could also affect wd chronology estimates given the difference in the cooling sequences for hybrids the hybrid wds are composed of significant he abundance with he mass fractions in the range 2 25 they reside in an in termediate mass radius range between purely he and purely co wds the latter issue which is not included in popula tion synthesis studies may slightly affect the later evolution and interaction of wd wd binaries which can strongly de pend on the wd radii we postpone further exploration of this issue for future studies we note that the different struc ture and composition of hybrid wds compared with same mass purely co he wds could in principle be probed us ing asteroseismology e g winget kepler 2008 given their prevalence among wd binaries hybrid wds may later further interact with their binary com panions in particular their role in merger of double degenerate systems wd wd wd ns wd bh could be of particular interest such hybrids and their merg ers could potentially give rise to explosive thermonu clear events with distinct properties due to the impor tant role of the he in catalyzing more effective thermonu clear reactions and detonations e g in the context of sub chandrasekhar sn explosions branch nomoto 1986
